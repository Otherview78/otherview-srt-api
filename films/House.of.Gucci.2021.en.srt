1
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,560
<i>It was a name that sounded
so sweet, so seductive.</i>

2
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,520
<i>Synonymous with wealth</i>

3
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,080
<i>style</i>

4
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,920
<i>power.</i>

5
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,800
<i>You passed one of their windows
and peeked inside</i>

6
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,240
<i>hoping you'd earn
enough money someday</i>

7
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,000
<i>to afford the second-cheapest item.</i>

8
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,000
<i>Surprise!</i>

9
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
<i>You won't.</i>

10
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,040
<i>But the last name was a curse too.</i>

11
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,760
<i>It belonged to a Tuscan family.</i>

12
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,400
<i>They didn't fight over land or crown.</i>

13
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,200
- Good morning.
- <i>Ciao.</i>

14
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,120
<i>They fought over their own skins.</i>

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,480
<i>Signor</i> Gucci?

16
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,800
Hey! Back to work.
Come on. Hey! Come on.

17
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Papa!

18
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,400
Perfect. It's just like mine.

19
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,560
Fernando Reggiani.

20
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
(Italian)

21
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,960
- Good girl.
- Hey, Fernando.

22
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,200
- Hey.
- Your lunches are getting expensive.

23
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,880
Because I have
expensive taste, huh?

24
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,800
Don't tell Ma.

25
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
She'll kill you.

26
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,880
You don't tell your mother.

27
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Hello.

28
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,200
Max. Darling.

29
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
Tonight?

30
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,160
I think I'm free.

31
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,120
Do you like it? Yeah?

32
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,760
This is fun!

33
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,200
No, no.

34
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,640
Tanqueray martini with a twist.

35
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,400
I don't work here.

36
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,880
Then why are you behind the bar?

37
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,600
Is this part of your costume?

38
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
I...

39
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,440
I didn't know it was a costume party.

40
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,720
The barten...

41
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,360
The bartender...

42
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah, I...

43
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,400
I'll make you a drink.

44
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,680
Thank you.

45
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,160
Who invited you?

46
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,560
Bianca.

47
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,040
I don't know her.

48
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,480
Bianca Sarzana.

49
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,280
It's her party.

50
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,800
Right. That Bianca.

51
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,880
I'm Patrizia.

52
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
Patrizia...

53
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,560
Maurizio Gucci.

54
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,320
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Patrizia.

55
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,280
It's a pleasure to meet you!

56
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,480
You too.

57
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,640
Patrizia, how come
I've never seen you before?

58
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,800
You weren't looking hard enough.

59
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,760
I would have noticed that Bianca
was friends with Elizabeth Taylor.

60
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,480
I can assure you...

61
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,400
I'm way more fun.

62
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
It's good.

63
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Wanna dance?

64
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
No.

65
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,520
That's good. Come on.

66
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,480
Is my dancing that bad?

67
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,000
No... no.

68
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
I have to go.

69
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,360
It's only midnight, Cinderella.

70
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,360
The night is young.

71
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,880
I turn into a frog at midnight.

72
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,560
It's nice to meet you, Patrizia.

73
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,320
It's a pumpkin.

74
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,000
Not a frog.

75
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Hello.

76
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
Hello.

77
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,320
I'm sorry, have we met?

78
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
Elizabeth Taylor.

79
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,800
- Patrizia Reggiani.
- Yes, of course. Patrizia Reggiani.

80
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,720
It's good to see you again.

81
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
You too.

82
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,360
Do you study here?

83
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,720
I'm considering it.

84
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,000
The problem is I hate reading.
I get bored.

85
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Oh.

86
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
What are those about?

87
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
These are...

88
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,560
Well, these are very exciting books
about the legislative process.

89
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,200
I'm studying to be a lawyer.

90
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,720
You seem too nice to be a lawyer.

91
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,880
Well, there are a few good ones.

92
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,360
The dead ones.

93
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,120
What were the chances of
us seeing each other again?

94
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
It's fate.

95
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,480
It was a really nice surprise.

96
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,280
Aren't you going to ask me out?

97
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,720
You... you wanna
go on a date with me?

98
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Of course, I would...

99
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,240
I want to see how this story goes.

100
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Yes...

101
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,040
That's my number.

102
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,080
I'm very busy,
but I'll make time for you...

103
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
Maurizio.

104
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,000
<i>- Ciao.
- Ciao.</i>

105
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
It's for you.

106
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Hello?

107
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,320
So do you think
you're gonna pass the bar soon?

108
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,640
I think I have a...

109
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,480
Would you like to go into this...

110
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,176
- Oh, no. I can't eat there.
- This place?

111
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,320
It's too expensive.

112
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
Okay.

113
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,600
Okay, I can try.

114
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,120
Would you like to go in?

115
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
No? Okay.

116
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,680
This is for you.

117
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,160
It looks so good. Thank you.

118
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,280
That's all right.
Can I have a napkin?

119
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
Can I have a bite?

120
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,480
So good. Here.

121
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,640
Oh, that's very good.

122
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Come on.

123
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Okay.

124
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,000
- Sit.
- Oh, no.

125
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,600
Get up. What are you doing?

126
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,840
- Are you okay?
- I fell back.

127
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
It's fine.

128
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,640
Father, I would like to introduce you
to Patrizia Reggiani.

129
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,640
Patrizia, this is my father, Rodolfo.

130
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Delighted to meet you.

131
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,200
I trust Adele has been
keeping you amused.

132
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,120
Picasso?

133
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,120
No... no. It's Klimt.

134
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,120
How silly of me.

135
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,920
Oh, no... no.

136
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,520
It's an easy mistake.
I've made worse myself.

137
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,680
Must be worth a fortune.

138
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,760
Yes. But you know, to me,
art, like beauty, has no price.

139
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,320
I made a reservation
for us at the Gallia.

140
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,520
Perfect choice.

141
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,160
So Patrizia...

142
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
What...

143
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,640
What exactly are your interests?

144
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,160
I'm a very social person.

145
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,600
- Are you?
- A people pleaser.

146
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,480
And do you study?

147
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,480
I work for my father's business.

148
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,200
And his business is?

149
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,320
Ground transportation.

150
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,320
Maurizio said
you used to be an actor.

151
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,160
Yes, I was.

152
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,680
You may remember a film,
<i>The Ancestor?</i>

153
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,640
No... no. Of course.

154
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
You're too young.

155
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,520
But sometimes on the TV,
they play a movie <i>Tourist Train.</i>

156
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,560
- <i>Tourist Train</i> sounds familiar.
- Yeah, well...

157
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,520
Maybe you noticed a dashing
young actor, Maurizio D'Ancora.

158
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,360
That would have been me.

159
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,320
I didn't know I was sitting
with a movie star.

160
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,600
Can I get an autograph?

161
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,040
Oh, no... no.

162
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,920
The only good thing
that came from my career was

163
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,440
meeting Maurizio's mother.

164
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,240
Now she, she was a star.

165
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,080
I remember at her funeral

166
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,320
during a moment of silent remembrance

167
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,760
Maurizio noticed the priest
lighting candles

168
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,880
and he began to sing

169
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,920
<i>Happy Birthday.</i>

170
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,880
He turned, maybe
the saddest moment of my life

171
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,120
into something...

172
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,400
How do you say, something sweet.

173
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,880
That's my son.

174
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,200
That is my dear boy.

175
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,560
- <i>Grazie,</i> Franco.
- Thank you, sir.

176
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,920
Ah, Maurizio.

177
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,760
I liked your Patrizia.

178
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
Charming.

179
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,680
Father, she really liked you.

180
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,200
Tell me, where did you meet her?

181
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,600
I met her at a party.

182
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Party?

183
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,960
Yeah, Luca Sarzana's house.
At the Palazzo Serbelloni.

184
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,880
Yes, I know where the Sarzanas live.

185
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
You know...

186
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,720
there is a certain sort
of young woman

187
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,800
who makes their fortune

188
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,160
from getting their hooks
into someone like you.

189
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,960
Well, yes, Father,
but... but Patrizia is not like that.

190
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,360
Well, I had Franco
do a little investigation.

191
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,960
I think she's after your money.
Like they all are.

192
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,680
The Reggianis...

193
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,800
are truck drivers.

194
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,720
Her father has a very successful
transportation business.

195
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
It is...

196
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,960
It is an empire.

197
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,600
A truck driving empire. How many?

198
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,200
- How many what?
- How many trucks?

199
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,040
50? 500?

200
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,320
What does he transport, garbage? Huh?

201
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Mafia!

202
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,400
Listen, I've...

203
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,160
I give you everything.

204
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,840
I give you this house,
I give you money.

205
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,720
You have a life. You...

206
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,200
What is it you want?

207
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,920
What I want is to marry her.

208
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,320
Live with her. Fuck her.
Have a good time with her.

209
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,960
Do what you want.
Go away on holiday. Go to Sardinia.

210
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,520
But no, not marry.

211
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,840
No, don't walk away.

212
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
Okay, listen to yourself.

213
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,280
You're so bitter
and you don't even realize it.

214
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,840
Who cares what her family name is
or how many trucks they have.

215
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,720
You hide here in the past

216
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,480
and you expect me
to hide here with you?

217
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,280
Not anymore!

218
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,200
These are your ghosts.

219
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,200
These are your ghosts, not mine.

220
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,520
These are your regrets.

221
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,920
Don't do this to me.

222
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,360
You can't stop it.

223
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,920
I can, I will.
I will... I cut you from my will.

224
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,280
I'll leave you with nothing.

225
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
That's fine.

226
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
I love her.

227
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,960
You're making a big mistake.

228
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,400
Oh, she's fine,
but, you know, she's a...

229
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,160
She's just a...

230
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,600
I love what she is.

231
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,360
<i>Sí?</i>

232
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,320
<i>Commendatory</i> Reggiani,
my name is Maurizio Gucci.

233
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,880
Patrizia!

234
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
(Italian)

235
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,880
I have had a disagreement
with my father

236
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,200
that has forced me to leave
my home and my family business.

237
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,760
I am still in school.

238
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,360
I'm studying to be a lawyer,
so as of this moment, I...

239
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,240
I do not have a job, but I...

240
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
(Italian)

241
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,720
But I'm in love with your daughter.

242
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,000
And I would like to marry her.

243
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,600
Although, now I have
nothing to offer her.

244
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,480
I... I need a job.

245
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Mom.

246
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,560
Mama.

247
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,520
Maurizio Gucci,
you're urgently needed in accounting.

248
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,720
Maurizio... Maurizio!

249
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
That was great.

250
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,400
The door! The door!

251
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Papa?

252
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Papa?

253
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,480
Hi, Papa.

254
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,760
(Italian)

255
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,760
<i>Ciao, ciao.</i>

256
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,520
(Italian)

257
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,480
(Italian)

258
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
(Italian)

259
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:01,640
(Italian)

260
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,280
Maurizio...

261
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:24,000
I'll love you forever,
for the rest of my life.

262
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,160
Me too.

263
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,120
(Italian)

264
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,560
What is this?

265
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,320
Where is this?

266
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,640
What is this?

267
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
What is this?

268
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,560
How about that.

269
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Yes.

270
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,440
Ah, Claudia.

271
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,576
- <i>Buona sera.</i>
- Good morning!

272
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,880
Good morning, Mr. Aldo.

273
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,960
Good morning.

274
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,040
- This way?
- That way.

275
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,760
<i>Konichiwa,</i> Mr. Gucci.

276
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,360
<i>Saikin do?</i>

277
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,200
What's all this Japanese bullshit?

278
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm learning.

279
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,680
You know,
they're our best customers, so.

280
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,960
They're loyal, they're quiet.

281
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,640
And they're rich.

282
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,080
One of your terrible ideas.

283
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
Here it is.

284
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,520
Gotemba.

285
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,280
Gotemba?

286
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,520
Yeah, near the foot of Mount Fuji.

287
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
It's a mall.

288
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,480
90 minutes by bus from Tokyo.

289
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,000
It will be built in the spring.

290
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,360
- A window into the Asian market.
- No... no.

291
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,480
It's a stepping stone.

292
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,760
- No... no.
- Come on!

293
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,760
No, Aldo. You and your profits.

294
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,680
Come on, things are fine as they are.

295
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,480
Gucci doesn't belong in a mall,
it belongs in a museum.

296
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,640
Museum where it'll make no profit.

297
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,320
What's this?

298
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
No.

299
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Aldo, as long as we are 50-50,
that's how it stays.

300
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
No malls.

301
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,360
I see Maurizio got married.

302
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,600
Oh, God.

303
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,960
Some bim... Oh, she's...
I can't even say her name.

304
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,760
Well, sooner or later
you will have to.

305
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,120
- No... no.
- Yes.

306
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,920
Maurizio and I history. History.

307
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
No, come on.

308
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,720
- I don't...
- You are old.

309
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,720
Maurizio is your only son.
He is your true legacy.

310
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,480
You don't bring him
back into the fold...

311
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,200
- Well, maybe...
- I'm telling you

312
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,200
you'll only wind up
being a bitter and lonely old man.

313
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,400
That's what happens to all of us.

314
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,720
Time will tell. But...

315
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,720
Yeah. When did you
last touch him, huh?

316
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,760
When did you last hug him?

317
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,160
You don't touch anybody.

318
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,800
You used to touch
every once in a while

319
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,000
now you, what, touch yourself?

320
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,120
- You? You, teaching me?
- That's correct.

321
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,360
How... how's it going with your boy?

322
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,640
Well, your son is a smart lawyer.

323
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,200
Mine is an idiot.

324
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,200
But he's my idiot.

325
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,000
And I know how to deal with him.

326
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,880
But you need to deal with your son.

327
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
Yes.

328
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,120
It's my birthday on Sunday.

329
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,360
Yeah?

330
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,520
We'll all be there.

331
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,440
You should come.

332
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,160
I'll have to look at my diary.

333
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,840
- Hello.
- <i>Hello.</i>

334
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,920
Who is this?

335
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,400
Sí, <i>this is Aldo. Aldo Gucci.</i>

336
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,656
- Aldo.
- <i>I hope I'm not interrupting</i>

337
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,120
<i>anything important.</i>

338
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,320
What could be more important
than a phone call from my new uncle?

339
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:52,920
I am truly sorry for not being
able to come to your wedding.

340
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,960
It was... I couldn't help it.
Business beckoned.

341
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,360
Go easy on that.

342
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
I understand, of course.
I know how busy you are.

343
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,200
<i>We are celebrating my birthday
this weekend at my villa.</i>

344
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,560
<i>And I think it would be
a perfect opportunity for you</i>

345
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,520
to come and meet the family.
What do you think?

346
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,520
Your birthday, I would love that.
How many candles is it?

347
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,800
<i>70.</i>

348
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,920
They say it's the new 69.

349
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,400
Well, I can't speak for Maurizio.

350
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,880
He's right here.

351
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
No.

352
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
Please.

353
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
<i>Ciao,</i> Aldo.

354
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
<i>Maurizio!</i>

355
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,880
How is my little lawyer?

356
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,200
<i>I'm fine. I'm fine.</i>

357
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,160
What are you doing this Sunday?

358
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,200
I... I'll double check.

359
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,200
Come to my birthday party.

360
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,160
I'm only in town
for a couple of weeks.

361
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,240
<i>Come on.</i>

362
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,480
Let me discuss it with Patrizia.

363
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
- Let's go! A little day trip.
- I don't...

364
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,000
You know, your father and I
aren't getting any younger.

365
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,320
These gatherings are becoming
more and more

366
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,000
of a rare occurrence, you know.

367
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Please.

368
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
<i>Come on!</i>

369
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,920
I'll be jumping out of a cake.

370
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,480
Come on. Kick his teeth out.

371
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,400
Come on! Come on!

372
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,400
Earn your fucking lunch!

373
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,200
What is that?
Kick his teeth out. Come on!

374
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,240
Go... go!

375
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,400
That's it. Go!

376
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,200
Maurizio! Come on!
We're missing a player.

377
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,520
- No... no.
- What no? Yes, yes. Come on.

378
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,800
We're missing a player.
Come on! Put it on.

379
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,880
Take that jacket off.

380
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,320
- Okay.
- You know it.

381
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,200
- Paolo!
- You... Watch him. Watch him play.

382
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
See that?

383
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,360
Oh, my God! Look at that!

384
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,120
Maurizio! Maurizio! <i>Passa, passa!</i>

385
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,920
That's your husband!

386
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
Paolo!

387
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,400
Papa...

388
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,720
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>
- Oh, no.

389
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,480
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

390
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,400
- How do you act shy?
- <i>Happy birthday</i>

391
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,200
- <i>Dear Aldo</i>
- Papa!

392
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,560
- "Papa." I love that.
- <i>Happy birthday</i>

393
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,120
He's never, never in his life
called me Papa.

394
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,880
Patrizia, you should know...

395
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,600
that the Guccis were noble
saddle-makers to medieval courts.

396
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,000
We have history flowing through
these green and red webbings.

397
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,560
And yes, we are expensive.

398
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,080
But quality is remembered
long after price is forgotten.

399
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,680
Huh?

400
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,880
Thoughts on Paolo's outfit, Domenico?

401
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,240
You're the fashionista.

402
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,400
It's eccentric.

403
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,080
I designed this myself.

404
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,680
Well, you should reconsider
your wardrobe choices, Paolo.

405
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,280
You are Gucci,
you need to dress the part.

406
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,600
It's chic.

407
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,000
My father's problem is that
he's stuck in the past.

408
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,160
He refuses to take Gucci
into the next century.

409
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,880
Yes, yes, Gucci is doing fine

410
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
- under my watch.
- No!

411
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,520
- No, don't worry about it.
- Oh, no!

412
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,400
No, no. It needs new ideas.

413
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,760
- New energy.
- Of course.

414
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,800
And I happen to be
bursting with creativity.

415
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,400
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, my bladder may be full

416
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,200
but my dreams are even fuller.
I'm like a rush of water.

417
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,000
Somebody build a dam.

418
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,680
Please.

419
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,000
You're always brushing me off.

420
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,600
I'm a designer.
I need to express myself.

421
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,560
- But why all this sudden moaning?
- I have a...

422
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,200
- What do you want?
- Because

423
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,720
I'm so sick of you ignoring me.

424
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,520
I am sick of your talking.

425
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,080
Sick of it.

426
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,480
- You deliberately hurt my feelings.
- Yes.

427
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,800
No... no.

428
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,736
- Jenny! Jenny, honey.
- No! That's what he wants.

429
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,960
- Don't. Sit down. Sit down!
- You have succeeded.

430
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,560
I haven't had espresso.

431
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,920
- Bye.
- Thanks for having us, Uncle.

432
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,400
My nephew, he has such great taste.

433
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,200
A small wedding gift.

434
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,520
Thank you. <i>Grazie.</i>

435
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,800
Come to New York. Okay?

436
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,320
- <i>Ciao,</i> Aldo. <i>Ciao.</i>
- <i>Ciao!</i>

437
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,320
(Italian)

438
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,040
Oh, it's good to see you.

439
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,720
I couldn't believe
you got into the car.

440
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,120
How did you do that?

441
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,520
It's all bullshit.

442
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,280
We're not royalty.

443
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,920
My grandfather Guccio was
a bellhop in London.

444
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,520
That's where he got
the idea for leather goods.

445
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,800
By carrying bags around
for rich aristocrats.

446
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,440
Gucci is like that cake.

447
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,200
Once you think
there's enough to go around...

448
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,240
then you'll have a taste,
and then you'll want more

449
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,640
and then you'll want
the whole thing for yourself.

450
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,160
What about you?

451
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,280
You just gonna sit around
and watch them eat everything?

452
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,720
Me? I am Gucci by name.

453
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,160
I don't have their Tuscan character.

454
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,680
It was diluted by
my mother's German blood.

455
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,960
The only wedding gift
the Guccis gave us.

456
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
Coupons.

457
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,560
Feels like cash.

458
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,920
I doubt it.

459
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,040
It's not cash.

460
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,120
Fucking Concorde.

461
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,680
To where?

462
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
New York.

463
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,880
New York.

464
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,680
Ah, Patrizia.

465
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,320
We can't drive to New York,
we have to fly.

466
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,840
You wanna go to New York?

467
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
- No.
- Everybody likes New York.

468
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
I don't.

469
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,680
I wanna go to New York.

470
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,480
New York.

471
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,400
I love New York.

472
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
What are you doing?

473
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,000
New York.

474
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,120
Okay.

475
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,760
Okay.

476
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,760
<i>Do you have
medical maladies, financial woes</i>

477
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,280
<i>heartbreak?</i>

478
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,240
<i>I can help you with everything</i>

479
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,880
<i>and anything.</i>

480
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,880
<i>And it's very, very private.</i>

481
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,480
<i>Because Pina is discreet.</i>

482
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,920
<i>And very accurate.</i>

483
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,560
<i>You can come to me with any worries.</i>

484
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,400
<i>There is no need to suffer.</i>

485
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,400
<i>Hello, who am I speaking to?</i>

486
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,000
Patrizia.

487
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,400
<i>How old are you, dear?</i>

488
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,120
25.

489
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,520
<i>25.</i>

490
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,000
<i>What is your question, Patrizia?</i>

491
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,840
Will I be successful?

492
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,800
<i>You have to be more specific.</i>

493
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,600
<i>In what? Career, marriage, what?</i>

494
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,440
Will I get what I want?

495
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,480
<i>That was not specific.</i>

496
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,520
<i>But I know what you want.
You want everything.</i>

497
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,040
<i>Well, don't be disappointed</i>

498
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,000
<i>if you don't hear
what you want to hear.</i>

499
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,000
Okay.

500
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,840
What's your name?

501
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,600
<i>My name is Pina.</i>

502
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,320
Hello, Pina.

503
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,960
Tell me everything.

504
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,280
<i>I see a great fortune</i>

505
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,040
<i>coming your way.</i>

506
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
How big?

507
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,200
- Sophia!
- Sophia!

508
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,920
Maybe, I'm not sure.

509
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,800
Yes, we have something.
I can show you.

510
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,680
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

511
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,080
All due respect,
these heels are not right for you.

512
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,120
Hello, Uncle.

513
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,080
No!

514
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,200
What are you doing? Patrizia.

515
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,920
- Oh, my!
- (Italian)

516
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,680
My gorgeous niece. Patrizia.

517
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,480
- (Italian)
- I was just in the neighborhood.

518
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
Yes?

519
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,576
- In the neighborhood?
- I was hoping I'd see you. Yeah.

520
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,920
Maurizio is a very smart young man.

521
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,240
So how are things with his father?

522
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,520
Not bad, not good.

523
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,840
Yeah.

524
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,640
My brother, he's a difficult man.

525
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:06,000
But it's time for them to reconcile.
Maurizio and his father, no?

526
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
<i>Sí.</i>

527
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,000
Maurizio wants to be
part of the family.

528
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,760
I can see it in his eyes.

529
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,760
But?

530
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,760
But he needs your help.

531
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,120
Yeah.

532
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,920
Well, how do I help?

533
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,840
Maybe we can
spend some time together.

534
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,680
Yeah, why not?

535
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,520
Darling Uncle.

536
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,080
Maurizio is...

537
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,200
He's proud.

538
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,560
We all are, darling.

539
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,960
We all are.

540
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,200
I love it.

541
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,920
My dear, you smell that? Smell that!

542
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,720
This is legacy.

543
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,520
These gorgeous beasts.

544
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,480
Do you know
that these gorgeous beasts

545
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,400
are the direct descendants

546
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,360
of the ones Guccio bought
way back when?

547
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,200
They deserve our respect.

548
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,360
They deserve our gratitude.

549
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
They are Val di Chiana cows.

550
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,040
Yes, yes. Hello.

551
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,240
(Italian)

552
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,720
I wanna introduce you
to my nephew Maurizio

553
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,320
and his beautiful new bride

554
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,040
- <i>Grazie.</i>
- Patrizia.

555
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,520
<i>- Ciao.
- Ciao.</i>

556
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,400
- Here, touch.
- Wow, this is soft.

557
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,200
Smell it too. It's really great.

558
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,520
Let me see this new one.

559
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,000
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

560
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:55,080
<i>Happy birthday, dear Aldo</i>

561
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,360
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

562
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,560
<i>- Bravo, bravo.
- Bravo.</i>

563
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I am ready!

564
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,040
I think I blow 'em out, right?
Is that a...

565
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,880
Come on! Help me
blow these out, please.

566
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,480
I like this place.

567
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,680
I love this place.

568
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,520
Am I boring you?

569
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,520
- No, no.
- No, no. We love it.

570
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,560
My word!

571
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,920
Because I can't talk to my son Paolo
about any of this.

572
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,880
He hates Gucci talk.

573
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,040
He only talks about himself.

574
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,560
But as you know, he's a strange bird.
My son is a strange bird.

575
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,080
He's definitely unique.

576
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,680
Useless. Sadly.

577
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,880
Maurizio!

578
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,480
- Yes?
- How are you?

579
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,600
- I'm good.
- You had a good day today?

580
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,136
It was good. I mean, I showed you

581
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,720
everything I could show you
in one sitting.

582
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,200
Yes. Thank you very much, Uncle.

583
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,456
- I'm glad.
- It's beautiful here.

584
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,520
I say this because Patrizia

585
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,760
has told me that
you may be interested

586
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,160
in learning about our business...

587
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,040
whatever.

588
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,480
Rodolfo lost a son.

589
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,000
Maybe I gain one. Right?

590
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,560
See that.

591
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,160
Family is important, Maurizio.

592
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,560
You can't erase yourself
from the family portrait

593
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,920
just because you enjoy
playing with trucks.

594
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,520
This is the happiest
I've been in my life.

595
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,320
Why change that?

596
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
You...

597
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,560
You're so much more than this.

598
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,320
You can help the family.

599
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,520
Strong family makes
a strong business.

600
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,520
I'm pregnant.

601
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,040
You're gonna be a father.

602
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,840
You're what?

603
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,360
I'm pregnant.

604
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,720
Will you help me...

605
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,840
Not my camera.

606
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,120
- Not the camera. Not the suit.
- No... no.

607
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,360
Come here.

608
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,240
Oh, Maurizio. Don't catch on fire.

609
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,880
Do you like it?

610
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,240
That is very beautiful.

611
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,720
Is that on sale?

612
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,680
Sale.

613
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,640
Patrizia!

614
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,840
- <i>Ciao,</i> Aldo.
- Maurizio!

615
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,920
<i>Ciao,</i> Aldo.

616
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,520
My youth serum. That's what you are.

617
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,960
How did you sleep?

618
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,040
Like babies.

619
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,680
The suite is unreal.

620
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,800
- Thank you.
- Wonderful.

621
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,160
Wonderful. You look good.

622
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,400
- Thank you.
- But you...

623
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,800
Well, that looks great on you.

624
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,640
- Gucci.
- Gucci?

625
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,880
Looks that good!

626
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,720
We're so surprised.

627
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,720
Yeah, Patrizia is
just playing dress-up.

628
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,680
Yeah. Well, here's a little secret.

629
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,080
Don't tell anybody. See?

630
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,320
Come here, Patrizia.

631
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,040
I got something I want to show you.

632
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,600
Sorry, Mauri,
don't take it personally.

633
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,520
Anything you see is yours.

634
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,720
You want it, you see it, it's yours.

635
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,800
- Family discount.
- Mr. Gucci!

636
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,640
Yes!

637
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,280
Excuse me.

638
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,800
<i>Konnichiwa! Konnichiwa!</i>

639
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,440
<i>- Konnichiwa! Aldo-san.
- Konnichiwa!</i>

640
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,600
Hi! How are you?

641
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,520
So what do you think?
What could you do, Maurizio?

642
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,440
Ah, yes.

643
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,000
<i>- Grazie.
- Grazie.</i>

644
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,400
Gucci world affairs coordinator.

645
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,240
What?

646
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,880
What does that even mean?

647
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,080
I don't know. It means something.

648
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,240
You'll be my eyes and ears
when I'm away.

649
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,240
You'll represent the company.

650
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,480
With foreign buyers or anybody else.

651
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,960
'Cause with your knowledge
of the law, your language skills

652
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,360
you fit right in.

653
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,376
Thank you. We're flattered
and we're grateful.

654
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,920
I'm glad. I know you are.

655
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,960
Yes?

656
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,640
Yes?

657
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,800
What are you thinking?

658
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,800
I'm thinking... I'm thinking

659
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,120
and thinking and thinking.

660
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,120
I'm thinking,
I'll certainly think about it.

661
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,000
Here's to you. And to New York.

662
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,880
- Franco.
- Morning, sir.

663
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,200
Just in time.

664
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,120
Here. Help me.

665
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,360
Yes, of course.

666
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,360
Boof.

667
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,640
Hello, Uncle.

668
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,280
My favorite uncle.

669
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,840
Hello.

670
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,680
Wow.

671
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,840
So svelte.

672
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,320
Your cheek bones could cut a diamond.

673
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,040
Oh, please. To what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

674
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:22,800
Well, I came first and foremost
to say... well...

675
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,720
Hello.

676
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,760
Well, hello!

677
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,600
Was there anything else?

678
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,320
<i>Allora...</i>

679
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,400
Maurizio and my father
have been spending

680
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,160
a lot of time together in New York.

681
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,680
And I thought...

682
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,720
maybe you and I could do the same.

683
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,120
Why would I...

684
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,280
Well, to discuss...

685
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,120
To discuss what?

686
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,880
My ideas.

687
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,600
- You have ideas?
- Boof.

688
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,920
Does an elephant shit in the jungle?

689
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,200
I was born with a gift.

690
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,760
I am an artist.

691
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,200
My father, he just won't see it.

692
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,480
But...

693
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,720
These are yours?

694
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,360
How come the family doesn't know
you have a gift?

695
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,120
Domenico, did you know
Paolo had a gift?

696
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,680
I'm afraid I did not, sir.

697
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,280
Well, we both know
he's blind in one eye

698
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,920
and deaf in the other. So.

699
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,120
- This is...
- Oh, wait.

700
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,320
Let me show you. <i>Zio.</i>

701
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,800
These were inspired
by my trip to Cuba.

702
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,120
I call this collection...

703
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,480
"Havana Libre."

704
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,240
Lots of pastels.

705
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,760
Rum inspired, sun-soaked
and lots of browns.

706
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:56,520
You have pastels and brown together.

707
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,280
Yes... yes.

708
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,360
I know, it's musical.

709
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,800
Paolo.

710
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,320
Yeah.

711
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,680
You must not show these to anyone.

712
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,920
Keep them hidden.

713
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,200
I mean it.

714
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,920
You feel they might steal
my ideas, right?

715
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,160
Oh, call me a lawyer.

716
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,720
Not you.

717
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,840
Over the years, I have found that...

718
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:38,720
true talent is often
unaware of its own brilliance.

719
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,040
It must be cherished and protected.

720
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,760
Whereas hacks, they run around...

721
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,840
shouting their delicious ideas

722
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,800
begging to be recognized.

723
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,200
Blind...

724
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,000
to their own...

725
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,800
mediocrity.

726
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,920
My dear nephew, you have achieved

727
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,240
a triumph of mediocrity.

728
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,320
And you have also achieved
the unimaginable.

729
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,880
You have found one thing

730
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,240
upon which
your father and I can agree.

731
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,400
Your total incompetence.

732
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,120
Oh, no.

733
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,920
Forgive me.

734
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,120
But I...

735
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,640
I have to take a meeting.

736
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,520
You designed this scarf, correct?

737
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,960
Oh, yes.

738
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,760
That scarf is my signature.

739
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:02,120
It has caressed the necks
of all the world's beauties.

740
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,760
Jackie O, Grace, Sofia.

741
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,520
Study it closely.

742
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,760
No browns, no pastels.

743
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,280
- Come.
- Yes.

744
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,840
I don't need anyone.

745
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,800
I'm Paolo.

746
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,040
Paolo Gucci.

747
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,920
And I am going to start...

748
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,560
my own line.

749
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,280
Mr. Gucci.

750
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,360
- Are you okay?
- <i>Sí, sí.</i>

751
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,360
<i>Grazie.</i>

752
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,120
My father is ill.

753
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,040
- <i>Ciao,</i> Franco.
- <i>Ciao,</i> Franco.

754
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,680
Maurizio.

755
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,760
Excuse me. Excuse me.

756
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,080
What is this?

757
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,440
I'm a grandfather?

758
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,880
Her name is Alessandra.

759
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,800
Like Maurizio's mother.

760
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,480
Whose idea was that?

761
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,400
Mine.

762
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,080
Well...

763
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,000
Alessandra.

764
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,760
Here. Come here. Come... come.

765
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,520
My boy.

766
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,040
You take care of Gucci now. Hmm?

767
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,000
I'm glad it wasn't a boy.

768
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,680
We need more women in this family.

769
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:48,480
There is no love on Earth greater
than that of a father for his son.

770
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,120
With a few exceptions.

771
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,520
Thank you for coming, Uncle.

772
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,000
Come to New York. Join the family.

773
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,240
Make him proud.

774
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,600
I'll think about it.

775
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,680
Yeah.

776
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,880
The house in St. Moritz.

777
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,400
Two beach houses, one in Nassau,
the other in Taormina.

778
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,280
23 horses.

779
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,360
Penthouse apartment
in Galleria Passarella

780
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,160
the only one in all of Milan
with a swimming pool.

781
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:40,040
And, of course, 50% of Gucci S.P.A.

782
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,680
But there is a slight complication.

783
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:53,200
He, Rodolfo, he never signed
the share certificate.

784
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,120
- Okay, what does that mean?
- Yeah.

785
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,120
You'll have to pay inheritance tax.

786
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:09,760
Oh, that's fine.

787
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,880
How much are we talking?

788
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,200
Could be as high as 14 billion lire.

789
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,240
- 14 billion?
- Yeah.

790
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,040
I can't afford that.

791
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,600
Well, you could sell your shares.

792
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,680
To who?

793
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,216
I can think of
a few qualified individuals.

794
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,360
Thank you. Leave them with us.

795
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,600
We'll review them
as soon as we're done mourning.

796
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,280
Of course.

797
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,880
Who does he think he is?

798
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,480
Suggesting you sell your shares.

799
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,600
Madness.

800
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,240
14 billion is totally unreasonable.

801
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:46,320
And just because
your father forgot to sign it.

802
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,200
Ten of spades
represents theft or loss.

803
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,120
Someone wants what is yours.

804
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,680
Don't let them take it.

805
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,120
And don't trust anybody.

806
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,520
Because I see an abuse of trust.

807
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:22,000
An attempt to deceive you
in your own house. You understand?

808
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,120
Yes, Pina.

809
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:28,120
Always have something red
on you for protection.

810
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,400
And wear more green.
Green is for cleansing.

811
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,000
Green doesn't go with my lipstick.

812
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,720
Change your lipstick.
You're already so beautiful.

813
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,200
Or wear green underwear.

814
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,720
Maybe it's time for you to take back.

815
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,160
Don't let these forces around you
dictate who you are.

816
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,680
You're strong. You're magnificent.

817
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:54,880
And...

818
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,120
Look at this.

819
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,320
There's a great love in your life.

820
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,720
Together, you can conquer the world.

821
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,360
Patrizia, look at me.

822
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,800
You will be the queen.

823
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,440
You.

824
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,600
Hi!

825
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,560
What a beauty.

826
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,720
What a beauty.

827
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,000
So good to see you.

828
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,120
Come. Come.

829
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,360
Much to show you.

830
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,680
This is your new office.

831
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,120
Wow.

832
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,760
I'm across the hall.

833
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,240
If you need me.

834
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,880
Okay.

835
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,880
Look. Enjoy.

836
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,280
- Thank you.
- <i>Ciao,</i> Aldo.

837
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,360
<i>Ciao.</i>

838
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,000
I got pane fresco.

839
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,416
If you didn't eat breakfast

840
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,480
your father's gonna
be very upset with you.

841
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,280
Ira?

842
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,240
Yes?

843
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,880
Ira, is this yours?

844
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,640
Yes.

845
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,720
Birthday gift. From my husband.

846
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,720
It's a Gucci.

847
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,760
Just like yours.

848
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,120
Which Gucci store did he go to?

849
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,360
Who is making this stuff?

850
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,600
Who's allowing this to happen?

851
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,880
As far as fakes go,
they're pretty good.

852
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,560
I mean, I'd buy them.

853
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,320
Don't be such a cretin.

854
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,400
Don't call me a cretin, sweetie.

855
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,120
That's not what I said.
I asked you not to be one.

856
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,080
This is serious
and you're laughing it off.

857
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,800
At least it's my name
on the mugs, not yours.

858
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,160
Our name, sweetie.

859
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:09,920
On junk!

860
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,040
They're not fake, by the way.

861
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,240
They're replicas.

862
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,040
I was just very, very surprised.

863
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,440
Well, you know what else
would surprise you?

864
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,520
How profitable this stuff is.

865
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,080
What about quality?

866
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,640
Your sacred cows?

867
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,400
Quality is for the rich.

868
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:42,560
If a Long Island housewife
wants to live

869
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,680
with the illusion that
she is a Gucci customer

870
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,880
why not? Let her.

871
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:52,320
Because it damages
Gucci's credibility.

872
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:56,080
Patrizia, this is us.

873
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,400
This is not a girl's game.

874
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,600
Yeah, but, Aldo, she's right.

875
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,840
This stuff is junk.

876
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,480
It's not what Gucci is.

877
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,320
Gucci...

878
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,320
is what I say it is.

879
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,480
I turned it into an empire.

880
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:25,680
Not Rodolfo. Certainly not my son.

881
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,120
And...

882
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,200
of course, not you, so...

883
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:41,400
Without me, you'd all still be
shoveling cow shit in Tuscany.

884
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,400
That's a fact.

885
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,920
Remember that.

886
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,360
We should remember that.

887
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,200
<i>Brava!</i>

888
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:02,880
Bravo! Bravo!

889
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,800
- A martini, please.
- Yes, sir.

890
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,440
Did you like the show?

891
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,560
Oh, it was incredible.

892
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,200
The... the lines and tones.

893
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,560
Well, what's your name?

894
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,320
My name?

895
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,000
Maurizio.

896
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,000
Maurizio what?

897
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,720
Maurizio Gucci.

898
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,280
Maurizio Gucci. How about that?

899
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,800
Gucci. You know, I used
to dress windows for Gucci.

900
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,600
Oh, really? Which store?

901
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,960
I can't remember. It was...

902
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,800
It was God-awful though.

903
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,200
Walter, by the way.

904
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,920
I'm a designer.

905
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,120
Okay, Walter.

906
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,640
Well, maybe you will design
for me someday.

907
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,000
No. No designer here's
gonna work for Gucci.

908
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,520
Right now, Gucci...

909
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,920
Gucci's just a cheap operetta.

910
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,920
<i>- Grazia.
- Salud.</i>

911
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,320
Well, enjoy yourself.

912
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,720
Do you want to be left in the dust?

913
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,680
You want to keep selling
coffee mugs in airports?

914
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,600
Is that your legacy?

915
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,880
It's time to take out the trash.

916
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,360
Aldo and Paolo, they're poison.

917
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,520
They're an embarrassment
to this company

918
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,800
and everybody knows it.

919
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,120
They have to go.

920
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,720
And you need to get
your fucking business organized.

921
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,640
Patrizia...

922
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,240
they're my family.

923
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,760
So am I.

924
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,680
He's starting a trade war.

925
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,320
Paolo barely has enough
to bankroll a pair of socks

926
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,696
- let alone start a war with anyone.
- I don't want to see it.

927
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,720
Yes, but he could still be a problem.

928
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,520
Aldo has awarded him
a number of shares in the company.

929
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,960
Yes, but Aldo didn't realize
what an idiot Paolo turned out to be.

930
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:21,920
Maurizio, we need to build a bridge
with Paolo and work things out.

931
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,160
You know how emotional he gets.

932
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,760
He's around all this male energy
all the time.

933
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,400
His wife isn't exactly the brightest.

934
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:32,160
He needs someone he can talk to,
who he trusts, who listens to him.

935
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,360
Someone like who?

936
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,880
Paolo likes me.

937
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,240
You do have a natural advantage.
You are not a Gucci.

938
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,040
I...

939
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,800
I need an espresso.

940
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,240
Can I ask you a question?

941
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,520
You just did.

942
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,760
Huh?

943
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,000
You just asked me a question.

944
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,696
And what you really want to know is
whether you can ask me two questions

945
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,080
one of which you've already asked.

946
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,760
That's good. Domenico, very funny.

947
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,040
Okay, here is my second question.

948
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:25,720
What do you see
as being your purpose at Gucci?

949
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:28,880
Is this a job interview?

950
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,160
Maybe.

951
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,560
I'm a conservationist.

952
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,480
Gucci is a rare animal.
It must be protected.

953
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,600
Protected from who?

954
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,160
From whoever threatens it.

955
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:48,240
I find it very interesting that

956
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:52,800
you have such a strong connection
to that which is not yours.

957
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,200
Yeah.

958
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,400
Sometimes it takes an outsider
to see the truth.

959
01:09:58,960 --> 01:09:59,960
<i>Bravo.</i>

960
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,360
Paolo

961
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,800
- this one reminds me of childhood.
- Yeah, well

962
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,680
it's a memory wrapped in lycra.

963
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,040
It's just so you. It's exquisite.

964
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,400
Do you think so?

965
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,200
You have a gift, I'm telling you.

966
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:17,560
Oh, well, stop.

967
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,040
Stop, you're going to make me...
you're going to make me cry.

968
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:26,800
Nobody has ever said that
to me. Nobody.

969
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,320
Paolo, why don't you have
your own line?

970
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,640
These are just mock-ups.

971
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,040
I can't afford to get serious.

972
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:38,920
With your gift, and your talent,
and your vision... Are you kidding?

973
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,640
Gucci needs new blood.

974
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,920
Goodbye 1930s.

975
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,360
Hello, '80s. Huh?

976
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,560
Oh, you took the words
right out of my guts.

977
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,280
Paolo Gucci is coming.

978
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:55,920
Come on.

979
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,120
I'm disgusted by the way
your father treats you.

980
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,760
Leaving you behind to groom Maurizio.

981
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,640
It's not right.

982
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:19,360
Who does he think he is?

983
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,040
Well, a dinosaur posing
as a butthole.

984
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,040
You were a comedian in a past life.

985
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,160
Maurizio likes you.

986
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,160
He always has.

987
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,640
Well, I like my cousin too.

988
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:44,440
He's quiet like a...
like a little mouse.

989
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:48,680
Tiny little mousy.
Doesn't scream like the others.

990
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,640
No, he doesn't.
And you and Maurizio together

991
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
that would be amazing.

992
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,560
- That's a new chapter for Gucci.
- No... no.

993
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,360
My father, he would never allow it.

994
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:02,080
He's got my little peaches
in a very tight grip.

995
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,840
Paolo...

996
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,240
maybe it's time...

997
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,880
to respectfully...

998
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,000
leave him behind.

999
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,360
You are justified.

1000
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:23,880
I do have

1001
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,640
something on my father.

1002
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,720
Can you keep a secret?

1003
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,680
Cross your heart and hope to die.

1004
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:38,640
Father, Son, and House of Gucci.

1005
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:39,960
Okay.

1006
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:42,680
Okay.

1007
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:51,880
Well, you know...

1008
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,816
- You don't have to tell me. Listen.
- It's just...

1009
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,680
I can come back any time.
We can talk about your designs.

1010
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:02,400
But what would I get out of this?

1011
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,760
We could offer you an exclusive deal

1012
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,160
to distribute your own line
under Gucci.

1013
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,160
I should talk to Maurizio.

1014
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,880
You talked to him?

1015
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,480
When?

1016
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,400
Today.

1017
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,240
He showed me his designs.

1018
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,520
Why didn't you tell me?

1019
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,880
I'm telling you now, aren't I?

1020
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,200
Patrizia, that's not the point.

1021
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,760
Don't focus on the process,
focus on the result.

1022
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,360
I told him

1023
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,480
we'd distribute
his clothing line under Gucci

1024
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,200
and he committed to a deal.

1025
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,640
Maurizio, those designs
won't see the light of day.

1026
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,600
We need Paolo on our side.

1027
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,920
What game are you playing?

1028
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,520
I'm looking out
for our best interests.

1029
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,600
Is that a game?

1030
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,840
Mau, Mau!

1031
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,640
Thank you for coming.

1032
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,000
You thought I lost my touch.

1033
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,160
No, not yet.

1034
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:38,800
<i>Ciao,</i> Paolo. You sounded urgent,
so I came right away.

1035
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:39,880
Very well.

1036
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:56,520
I got these from
three of his ex "secretaries".

1037
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,840
He's not exactly
a favorite among the ex's.

1038
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:02,280
In fact, they all hate his guts.

1039
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:12,120
Gucci is a very black hole
of undeclared income.

1040
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,880
Paolo, this is fraud

1041
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,360
on a global scale.

1042
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:19,800
In Italy, taxes are okay,
but in America

1043
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,800
it is very different.

1044
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,880
We should keep this to ourselves.

1045
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:31,880
But we can use it as leverage
to persuade him a bit.

1046
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:33,760
And with you...

1047
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,960
on my side

1048
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,800
we have the majority we need

1049
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,200
for you to become your own man.

1050
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:43,800
And he won't get into
any real trouble, right?

1051
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,360
No. At this point

1052
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,720
worst case scenario,
he pays his taxes.

1053
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,200
They slap his wrists.

1054
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,920
Happens all the time.

1055
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,200
But more importantly,
he would see you.

1056
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,360
He would see you.

1057
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,360
I could finally soar...

1058
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,760
like a pigeon.

1059
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,560
I'm tired of being held back.

1060
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,320
Father, I'm tired of being held back.

1061
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,640
I'm serious.

1062
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,680
I'm serious.

1063
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,800
I'm tired of being held back.

1064
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,480
I want freedom.

1065
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:26,680
I'm serious.

1066
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,200
No, I'm serious.

1067
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:32,760
<i>Hello?</i>

1068
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,520
<i>Hello?</i>

1069
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,240
- Yeah. The...
- <i>Hello, can you hear me?</i>

1070
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,120
No, it's a terrible line, and I...

1071
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,240
<i>Can you hear me now?</i>

1072
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,600
<i>I can call you back.</i>

1073
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,640
No, no. It's midnight.

1074
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,320
<i>It's late here. Just tell me
what's on your mind. What happened?</i>

1075
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,520
I...

1076
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:51,120
I want my freedom.

1077
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,400
I'm tired of being held back.

1078
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,600
- I'm serious.
- <i>Freedom?</i>

1079
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:01,480
Paolo, please just wait
till tomorrow.

1080
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,656
I'll talk to you about it tomorrow,
all right? I'm busy here.

1081
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:07,000
I have your tax filings.

1082
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:10,440
Taxes? What are you talking about?

1083
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,040
- <i>That's it, Paolo.</i>
- I don't want to expose you

1084
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,200
- <i>Father.</i>
- I'll talk to you

1085
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:15,440
tomorrow. Go to bed.

1086
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,160
- <i>You need to go to bed, Paolo.</i>
- I...

1087
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,240
<i>All right?</i>

1088
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,840
Hi, Adriana. How are you?

1089
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,920
Hi.

1090
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,200
Al.

1091
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,800
What?

1092
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,400
What?

1093
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:06,560
Criminal tax evasion
sounds pretty serious.

1094
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,880
What if they dig deeper?
What if they find even more dirt?

1095
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,400
<i>My father, he's 70.</i>

1096
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,000
<i>He's no spring chicken.</i>

1097
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,480
We were just supposed to spook him.

1098
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,560
Do you think he'll know it was us?

1099
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,200
<i>Paolo, no... no. He'll be fine.</i>

1100
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,240
I'm sending a draft
of your contract next week

1101
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:33,360
and we'll go into production
on your line soon after.

1102
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,040
<i>My line?</i>

1103
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,720
How can I think about my line

1104
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,680
when my father could be
dropping the soap?

1105
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,560
<i>Paolo</i>

1106
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,000
isn't this what you wanted?

1107
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,520
Paolo...

1108
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,520
how could you do this to me?

1109
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,600
Mr. Aldo Gucci.

1110
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,320
This court finds you guilty

1111
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,360
of five counts of failure
to file accurate tax returns

1112
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:27,560
one count of failure to file a report
of a foreign bank account

1113
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,200
and two counts of bank fraud.

1114
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,800
I hereby sentence you
to a year and a day

1115
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,440
in a state penitentiary.

1116
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,920
Court will stand adjourned.

1117
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,160
Good evening. Are you Paolo Gucci?

1118
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,000
The one and only.

1119
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,560
Another parking ticket?

1120
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,680
"Cease and desist"?

1121
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,280
Well, you've broken
certain exclusive rights

1122
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,720
granted to the copyright holder

1123
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,760
such as the right to reproduce,
distribute, display or perform

1124
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,200
a protected work.

1125
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,120
Copyright holder?

1126
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,480
I am the copyright.

1127
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:38,520
- I am sorry. But it's Gucci S.P.A.
- Do something.

1128
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:59,240
Please, the show is over. Thank you.

1129
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,560
Towards the exit, please.

1130
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,880
We have to go, please, everyone.

1131
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,640
Get down from the catwalk.
Keep moving, please.

1132
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:09,920
The show is over.

1133
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,320
Towards the exit.

1134
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:55,920
Paolo.

1135
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,400
Why?

1136
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,880
Why?

1137
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,560
Why did you do it?

1138
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,760
- Do what?
- What happened?

1139
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:11,880
Don't even look at me,
you lying sack of potatoes.

1140
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,720
- Shut your fucking mouth.
- Paolo.

1141
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:14,936
- We are outside the church.
- Paolo!

1142
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,256
- You shut your fucking mouth.
- You shut your mouth.

1143
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,600
Think about Alessandra.

1144
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,360
Get her in the car.

1145
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,640
- Put Alessandra in the car.
- Paolo, what's wrong?

1146
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:22,920
You...

1147
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,280
And you!

1148
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,640
- Okay. Okay!
- You ripped my heart out

1149
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:30,520
let it die in the street.
Oh, my God. My wife...

1150
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:34,440
My wife had to sing
till her voice was hoarse

1151
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,800
while we figured out
what the fuck was going on.

1152
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:43,400
Why did you report me
for copyright breach?

1153
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:45,600
Gucci is my name too.

1154
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,680
You abused the Gucci name.

1155
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:49,920
No, no.

1156
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,720
- And started a trade war.
- No. I... No.

1157
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,080
I didn't. I swear I didn't, okay?

1158
01:22:56,160 --> 01:23:00,560
It's my name.
It's not even your real name, okay?

1159
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,760
Mau...

1160
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:09,400
Mau, it's me, Paolo.

1161
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,440
How could you?

1162
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,720
But we're a family. Huh?

1163
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,880
What about our family business?

1164
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,120
You're right.

1165
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:30,560
- You're right.
- No.

1166
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,360
We are a family business.

1167
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,856
You're right
and I don't want to hurt you.

1168
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,440
I want to do right by you.

1169
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,280
But, Paolo, we have
a proposition for you.

1170
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,240
It's the only way.

1171
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:47,960
Sorry.

1172
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:55,680
We want to buy your shares of Gucci.

1173
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,040
You got some courage, you know that?

1174
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:13,800
And she has bigger mangoes than you.

1175
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,560
You're a character, you know that?

1176
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,800
My quiet lawyer cousin.

1177
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,400
- Okay. Okay.
- The tiny little mouse

1178
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,480
is a character.

1179
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,160
- Hey, watch out.
- Who knew?

1180
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:35,880
Paolo, we both know
it's for the best.

1181
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:36,960
Boof.

1182
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:45,600
Never confuse shit with <i>cioccolato.</i>

1183
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,720
They may look the same...

1184
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,600
but the taste?

1185
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,360
Very different.

1186
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,680
Trust me, I know.

1187
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:00,880
I'd rather see Gucci burn than
to hand it over to you two bastards.

1188
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:04,720
<i>Ciao.</i>

1189
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,600
Come on, let's go.

1190
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,120
Paolo...

1191
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,000
Let's go, Maurizio. Come on.

1192
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:23,720
How do you know all this?

1193
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:25,360
Maurizio, could you...

1194
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:32,760
There's the police.

1195
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,240
- The police are here?
- Yeah. Financial police.

1196
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:56,920
- Go.
- Go upstairs.

1197
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,480
- Gather with me.
- Check everywhere.

1198
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,560
Come on.

1199
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:01,720
Please. In there.

1200
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,040
Can I help you?

1201
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,480
(Italian)

1202
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,080
<i>Signore!</i>

1203
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,680
Can I help you?

1204
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,160
Of course, madam.

1205
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,120
Patrizia Gucci.

1206
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,000
Alberto de Renzi.
Man in charge of the operation.

1207
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,160
<i>Volete un caffè?</i>

1208
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:52,160
No, thank you. We don't drink.

1209
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,000
- Johnnie Walker? Splash of water?
- Neither, thank you.

1210
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,120
Passport, please.

1211
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,320
And open your visor.

1212
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:33,840
Thank you.

1213
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,120
(Italian)

1214
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:01,680
Thank you, Roberto.

1215
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,440
You're not listening to me.

1216
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,040
I'm here to help you.

1217
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,720
Thank you, <i>Signora</i> Gucci.

1218
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:10,920
We just need to perform
a few more analyses.

1219
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,880
Please, let me help you.

1220
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,640
I'm very resourceful. Let's discuss.

1221
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:19,360
We have nothing more to say
at this moment. Thank you.

1222
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1223
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,240
Patrizia, please. Please.

1224
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,360
- Goodbye, <i>Signora</i> Gucci.
- Domenico, please.

1225
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:30,200
It took you fucking long enough.

1226
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:32,000
Maurizio called from St. Moritz

1227
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,160
and he said you can join him there
whenever you want.

1228
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,880
They took my daughter's shoes.

1229
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,400
What's this about a forged signature?

1230
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,480
Eh?

1231
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,080
What forged signature?

1232
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:02,880
You know nothing about it?

1233
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:06,800
Get them out.

1234
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,200
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1235
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:13,680
Paolo.

1236
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:16,720
Paolo.

1237
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,320
- Must be Paolo.
- Yeah.

1238
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,680
I told you he was
fucking trouble. Idiot.

1239
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,000
Maurizio?

1240
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,440
Paola.

1241
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,600
- I knew it was you.
- Oh, wow!

1242
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:32,280
Paola.

1243
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:33,760
You look exactly the same.

1244
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,360
So do you.

1245
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:36,776
Until then, you're coming with us.

1246
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,336
- I am not going. No.
- Because you said you were.

1247
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:40,480
- I always wanted to come.
- You said you would.

1248
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,000
Maurizio, Maurizio!

1249
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,680
Hey.

1250
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:58,760
Hope I'm not interrupting.

1251
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,560
No, of course not.
You're not interrupting.

1252
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:03,600
I see you've put up the tree.

1253
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,160
Yes. Yes.

1254
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:08,040
Everybody, this is Patrizia.

1255
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:12,200
- Hey, Patrizia.
- And this is Alessandra.

1256
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:13,920
- Hello.
- Franco and Gianni

1257
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
you know, of course.

1258
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,840
This is my friend Paola
and these are all of her slaves.

1259
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,120
Alessandra.

1260
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,000
Oh, sorry.

1261
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,320
What do you think of the macaroons?

1262
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:35,000
This hazelnut one is to die for.

1263
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,080
Yeah.

1264
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,640
Where did you get 'em?

1265
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:41,640
There is this charming little place
by Notre-Dame-de-Lorette

1266
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:43,120
- in Paris.
- "De-Lorette".

1267
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,200
Notre-Dame-de-Lorette.

1268
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:46,920
- Right.
- De-Lorette.

1269
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:50,960
Maurizio and I stayed there
five years ago.

1270
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,680
We had the most amazing time.

1271
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:57,400
I begged Maurizio to take me there
for my 25th birthday.

1272
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:00,000
And of course, he obliged.

1273
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:04,560
As soon as we landed, we went
to the Jules Verne restaurant

1274
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:06,040
in the Eiffel Tower.

1275
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,440
It's at the top.

1276
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,480
No... no. It's on the second floor.

1277
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,400
It was magnificent.

1278
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:16,000
Later we went to the Louvre.

1279
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,400
I'd always dreamt
of seeing the Louvre.

1280
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:21,240
We arranged for a private tour.
Thank God.

1281
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:23,760
Imagine all those crowds.
I couldn't do it.

1282
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,320
They just want to know
where you got the macaroons, sweetie.

1283
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,296
- I'm telling them.
- Yeah, you're filling the story

1284
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,120
full of unnecessary details.

1285
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,360
I don't think our guests mind.

1286
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,320
They wouldn't say if they did.

1287
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,360
You're an unnecessary detail.

1288
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:48,640
What I am trying to tell you is

1289
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:52,320
De Sole is the only person
who saw the unsigned certificates.

1290
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:56,680
He worked for my father for ten years
and he never questioned him.

1291
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,560
I trust him.

1292
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:01,160
He's not the problem.

1293
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,720
I heard the way you spoke to me
at lunch. He's not the problem?

1294
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,600
I was tired.

1295
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:13,400
Next time, don't embarrass me
in front of those people.

1296
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,120
Those people are friends of mine.

1297
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,000
I've known most of them
longer than you.

1298
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,960
He is the problem. Say it!

1299
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:24,800
Patrizia, I was tired. I'm tired.

1300
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,920
Then wake yourself up and say it.

1301
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,320
Okay.

1302
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:32,320
When you make me
sneak around my own family.

1303
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,520
When you set father and son
against each other

1304
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,120
and me against Paolo.

1305
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,520
When you second-guess a person
like Domenico De Sole

1306
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,920
the only person my father trusted.

1307
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:43,416
These things have an effect

1308
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,840
on the environment I operate in.
On me.

1309
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:48,760
Actions have consequences.

1310
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,600
I did that for you.
I was being constructive.

1311
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:54,560
I'm not gonna apologize
for that. No thanks.

1312
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:59,360
My uncle is in prison
and my cousin thinks I'm scum.

1313
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:01,600
And you think that's constructive?

1314
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,000
Don't pin Gucci's problems
on me, okay?

1315
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,960
I'm just here mopping up
your fucking mess.

1316
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:07,640
I never asked for your help.

1317
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,240
Maurizio

1318
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,640
we're only stronger together.

1319
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,000
The only thing I need from you

1320
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:32,760
is to stay away from Gucci
before you cause any more damage.

1321
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,400
I can handle it by myself.

1322
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:38,240
Is that clear?

1323
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:44,920
Truthfully, I'm only getting involved

1324
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,560
because you are
an incompetent, little baby idiot.

1325
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,000
You're a fucking weak little brat.

1326
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:54,440
You really are
only one half of Gucci.

1327
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:55,640
The shit half.

1328
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,560
And you want a real man?

1329
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:02,880
Here.

1330
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,240
Maybe you'll grow a little.

1331
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:22,280
Red, green, red, green. Red.

1332
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,520
- Green.
- Red.

1333
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,800
- Green.
- Very good, Alessandra.

1334
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:27,520
- Green, red.
- Green.

1335
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,760
- Green, red.
- Green.

1336
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,056
- I think that's it.
- Green.

1337
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,120
Red, green, red, green, red, blue.

1338
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:34,920
- Red, green. Red, green.
- Red, green. Red, green.

1339
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,560
Red, blue.

1340
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:40,480
Red, green, red, green,
red, blue. Yellow. Okay.

1341
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:44,680
- Red. Green. Red. Green. Red.
- Red. Green. Red. Green.

1342
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:46,320
- Blue. Yellow.
- Blue. Yellow.

1343
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,360
- You're very...
- The winner.

1344
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:52,560
The winner gets a present.

1345
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,760
For Alessandra.

1346
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,680
Thank you, Mommy.

1347
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,000
We'll play later.

1348
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,520
Who is that?

1349
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:09,720
Turn it around.

1350
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,360
Who is that...

1351
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,880
Who is hiding in there?

1352
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:17,640
I love you.

1353
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,680
I love you. <i>Ti amo.</i>

1354
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:23,000
- (Italian)
- Merry Christmas.

1355
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:25,160
Do you like him?

1356
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,320
For Daddy, from me.

1357
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:38,000
You can change the strap
if you don't like that color.

1358
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:39,200
Oh, no. It's fine.

1359
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:43,320
Okay.

1360
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,800
Thank you.

1361
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,400
For Mommy, from Daddy.

1362
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,160
I never know what to get you.

1363
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,680
I'm sure it's perfect.

1364
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,600
A Bloomingdale's gift card.

1365
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:16,880
Yeah, now you can get what you want.

1366
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,760
You know I never shop there.

1367
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:24,560
Well, there is a first time
for everything.

1368
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,560
- Paola, darling.
- Oh.

1369
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,760
Love the all-white outfit.

1370
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,320
So chic.

1371
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,640
I made some strudel for you and M.

1372
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,520
It's the only thing
I know how to make.

1373
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,080
I'm on a diet, but I'm sure
Maurizio will love your strudel.

1374
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:03,200
Would you like a cigarette?

1375
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:04,600
No.

1376
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,000
(Italian)

1377
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:14,200
You ever steal anything, Paola?

1378
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,040
What?

1379
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,560
Forgive me.

1380
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:19,680
I am trying to teach Alessandra

1381
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,320
the importance of not touching
other people's belongings.

1382
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:34,120
I don't consider myself
a particularly ethical person

1383
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,320
but I am fair.

1384
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,760
What I cannot wrap my head around...

1385
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:45,520
is people who steal just for ego.

1386
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,120
Or the pleasure of it.

1387
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,800
For personal satisfaction.

1388
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:08,120
I'll have my maid
drop off the strudel.

1389
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,200
Good to see you.

1390
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:36,160
Do you like my hair?

1391
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,040
Maurizio, do you like my hair?

1392
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,200
Oh, yes, very nice.

1393
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,280
Very chic.

1394
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,200
I was thinking, tomorrow...

1395
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,200
Franco is coming tomorrow at noon.

1396
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:27,640
Why?

1397
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,520
To take you both back to Milan.

1398
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,640
Can we at least talk about it?

1399
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:57,880
I'll find the right words to say
what I want to say when I'm ready.

1400
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:03,200
You really, really hurt me.

1401
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,240
Paolo won't do it.
He's too scared of his father.

1402
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,720
<i>He's drowning in debt.
But we can't buy him out.</i>

1403
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:24,280
<i>We need a cash partner, Maurizio.</i>

1404
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:26,320
Who do you suggest?

1405
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,080
Investcorp.

1406
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:32,240
<i>It's owned by Nemir Kirdar.
He's an Iraqi powerhouse.</i>

1407
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:34,840
<i>They like
high-end retail investments.</i>

1408
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:38,120
<i>They bought Tiffany's in '84
and turned it around quick.</i>

1409
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:49,000
<i>Maurizio.</i>

1410
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,360
Plant the seed with him.
I'll be back soon.

1411
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,280
Something's different.

1412
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,800
Maurizio's changed.
He's excessive and...

1413
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:04,840
crazy.

1414
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:07,680
And that woman...

1415
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:10,600
Don't be scared.

1416
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,160
He's nothing without you.

1417
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:16,560
Men have an awful problem

1418
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:19,720
with thinking they are smarter
than they actually are.

1419
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:25,000
You mustn't let this negative energy
eat you up. Huh?

1420
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:27,680
Remember

1421
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:30,760
you are unstoppable, Patrizia.

1422
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:32,400
Say it.

1423
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:34,760
I'm unstoppable.

1424
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:40,400
I'm unstoppable.

1425
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,840
I am only 50% of Gucci. I'm...

1426
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:47,200
I'm here representing
my own interests.

1427
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:51,280
I want someone to bring Gucci
to the forefront of today's fashion.

1428
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:55,800
I want a partner who can
buy out the other half of Gucci

1429
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:57,400
that's giving me a headache.

1430
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:02,680
The half that's preventing
Gucci from being great.

1431
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:06,120
The half that belongs
to your uncle and your cousin.

1432
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,320
Investcorp has had
great success with Tiffany.

1433
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,320
It is... it is a resurrection.

1434
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:12,520
True. But Tiffany isn't Gucci.

1435
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,520
Gucci is a family business.

1436
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:15,920
That means family problems.

1437
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:19,200
Yeah, well, I brought
something for you.

1438
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:36,400
Burgundy.

1439
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:39,320
Size ten U.S. wide, right?

1440
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:42,520
This model is part
of the permanent collection

1441
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:44,720
at the Metropolitan Museum
in New York.

1442
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:47,400
You can't buy it anywhere.

1443
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:51,000
And now it is yours.

1444
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:18,400
Yes, I...

1445
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:20,160
Well, I...

1446
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:22,360
Well, when then?

1447
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:25,680
I've got to wash.

1448
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:31,360
If you could smell between
my groins, you'd understand.

1449
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:35,080
<i>Sí.</i>

1450
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:36,320
No, not...

1451
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,320
Paolo.

1452
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:00,640
Come on.

1453
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:04,440
I think it's...

1454
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:06,200
No, I know.

1455
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:08,720
- I know, it's...
- You know what?

1456
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,240
There's no cars there.

1457
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:14,400
No, no. It's... it's over there.

1458
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,520
It's over here. It's here,
I know. Fuck a duck

1459
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:20,320
- it's over here.
- What kind of car is it?

1460
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,520
Fiat 600.

1461
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:24,680
Fiat.

1462
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:27,040
Fiat 600.

1463
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:29,960
Paolo, it's here.

1464
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:32,160
Boof.

1465
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:43,040
Here. Right here.

1466
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:48,600
Boof.

1467
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:54,760
Well...

1468
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:59,000
I didn't know
you would end up in prison.

1469
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:02,560
- What?
- I hate myself for it.

1470
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:03,880
Don't, please.

1471
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,960
What did you do here? What is this?

1472
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:10,000
Well, I have been a bit stressed.

1473
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:11,680
No, it is...

1474
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:16,120
- We have to clean this.
- Well, my life has been hard.

1475
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:17,480
- Really hard. I...
- It's...

1476
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:19,360
- I haven't shit in a week.
- No, it's filthy!

1477
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:22,320
And that bitch of a wife
promised to help me.

1478
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:25,080
He shook my hand
while she knifed me in the back.

1479
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:27,720
- Oh, Paolo.
- I've been drowning in legal fees.

1480
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:29,880
It's been really, really bad.

1481
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:31,440
- I know.
- I couldn't even make love.

1482
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:34,400
Jenny left. And after that,
I was in bed

1483
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,480
- Jenny.
- With a pound of gelato <i>cioccolato</i>

1484
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,360
and very dark thoughts.

1485
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:40,240
I am back. I am back.

1486
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:43,800
We will start where we left off.

1487
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:44,880
Okay?

1488
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:49,840
I also glad to have you back.

1489
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,560
Well, it's good to be back too.

1490
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:58,360
Well, look at this place.

1491
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:01,680
It looks like it's given up.

1492
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:04,920
What?

1493
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,320
- Well...
- What?

1494
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:20,800
What's that?

1495
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:24,400
A really good deal.

1496
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,800
What deal?

1497
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:31,320
I met with their lawyers too.

1498
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:36,240
I couldn't say no. I needed the cash.
I mean, look at this dump.

1499
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,520
I don't even have basic cable.

1500
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:40,600
No.

1501
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:47,320
I sold my shares of Gucci to them!

1502
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:48,960
No!

1503
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:50,240
No!

1504
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,640
No! No!

1505
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,800
I know. I'm done.

1506
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:07,960
- No. No. No.
- No, I'm done. I'm dead.

1507
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,320
- I'm dead.
- No.

1508
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,560
I'm dead!

1509
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Dead!

1510
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,120
Come. Come here.

1511
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,520
You're...

1512
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:26,080
an idiot.

1513
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,880
But you're my... you're my idiot.

1514
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:33,600
Maurizio, these must've
cost you a fortune.

1515
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:36,000
Art has no price.

1516
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:38,320
I'm scared to touch anything.

1517
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:40,000
Oh, don't be scared.

1518
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:43,440
Actually, be a little scared.

1519
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:44,800
That... that couch costs

1520
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:47,880
more than most people's
apartment in Monte Carlo.

1521
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:52,840
- I'll try not to make a mess of it.
- No... no.

1522
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:54,960
Please, please. Make a mess.

1523
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:00,200
Gucci will pay for it.

1524
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:10,920
For the first time in my life,
I can do whatever I want.

1525
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:14,200
I like this song.

1526
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,320
Take me back to Ipanema.

1527
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:21,600
I've never been.
I've always wanted to go.

1528
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:27,680
Let's go. Right now.

1529
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:41,520
(Italian)

1530
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:42,960
Can you dance salsa?

1531
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,040
Of course I can.

1532
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:48,560
I can't.

1533
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:54,440
This could be a big mistake.

1534
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:57,520
It's not a mistake.

1535
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,200
It's a choice.

1536
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:02,320
You can do what you want now.

1537
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:50,560
Tell me where he is.

1538
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:53,800
Just tell me where he is, Pina.

1539
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:55,560
I couldn't see.

1540
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:57,520
You're fucking lying to me!

1541
01:50:58,160 --> 01:50:59,480
Where the fuck is he?

1542
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:05,880
Tell me where he is!

1543
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:30,920
Where is he?

1544
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,280
I'm afraid he couldn't come.

1545
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:33,760
What do you mean he couldn't come?

1546
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:35,720
He had a business meeting in Paris.

1547
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:36,960
He's lying and so are you.

1548
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:39,240
Maurizio is very busy, Patrizia.

1549
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:43,480
He didn't even have the decency to
come to his daughter's last recital.

1550
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:44,920
What kind of a father is he?

1551
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:47,680
There will be a new arrangement.

1552
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:50,000
And why did he send you, huh?

1553
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:51,880
Hey, Domenico, why did he send you?

1554
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:53,800
What are you,
his little fucking messenger?

1555
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:55,336
He didn't have
the decency to come here.

1556
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:57,320
He's too much of a coward
to do it himself?

1557
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:59,160
I have the papers right here.

1558
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,080
Papers?

1559
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:04,200
Ah, papers!
I'm not signing any papers.

1560
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:06,480
You can tell him
to come here and talk to me

1561
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:08,040
like a fucking normal human being.

1562
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:11,320
Maurizio said you and Alessandra
can continue to live in the penthouse

1563
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:13,520
since it's no longer
his primary residence.

1564
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,760
He's happy to extend payments

1565
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:17,656
until you are able
to stand on your own two feet.

1566
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:19,640
- What are you talking about?
- Please.

1567
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:22,280
What are you saying?
What are you saying to me?

1568
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:25,080
Huh? These are words

1569
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:26,576
- Domenico. I'm not talking to you.
- Support for Alessandra.

1570
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:27,976
- You come to my daughter's school.
- Shared custody.

1571
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,520
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Shared custody. He wants...

1572
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:33,960
He wants to make this as easy
as possible for both of you.

1573
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:36,920
Shared custody?

1574
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:39,520
Are we talking about divorce?

1575
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:41,760
Is that what we're doing here?

1576
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,160
Where is he right now?

1577
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:49,080
Where is he right now?

1578
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,600
I'm not at liberty to say.

1579
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:52,880
Look in my eyes.

1580
01:52:55,880 --> 01:53:00,680
Do you see anything in these eyes
that would let you think

1581
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:04,520
that I would ever let anyone
ruin my daughter's life?

1582
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:06,920
Compromise her.

1583
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:09,440
Do you?

1584
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:11,640
Do you see that?

1585
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:17,000
You know that won't happen.

1586
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:20,280
I will relay the message.

1587
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:22,200
Get the fuck out of here.

1588
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:23,720
Yeah.

1589
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:33,880
For your review, Mr. Gucci.

1590
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,520
We hope you'll find
this offer appealing.

1591
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Well...

1592
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:43,080
I'd rather not read my own obituary

1593
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:44,160
no?

1594
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:45,880
Maestro, I can assure you

1595
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:48,600
there's no greater admirer
of Gucci than myself.

1596
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:51,440
Oh, God.

1597
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:55,120
To be able to finally sit down
with a member of the dynasty. It's...

1598
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:58,240
something we will cherish forever.

1599
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:00,560
And truly

1600
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:03,240
I understand how difficult this is.

1601
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:06,200
Please don't patronize me. Please.

1602
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:10,200
Those words are not comforting to me.

1603
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:15,400
They make me feel offended
in a way, I must say.

1604
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:17,200
Mr. Gucci

1605
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:19,720
I have a plane
that leaves in one hour.

1606
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:21,480
If there is a problem with the offer

1607
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:23,360
Said and Omar,
they're at your disposal.

1608
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:31,120
No... no. We are very grateful
for your offer except no.

1609
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:32,600
Right, Papa?

1610
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:35,520
That shoe you showed me before

1611
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:39,640
take a look inside your shoe
and see at the heel.

1612
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:41,440
There's something you should see.

1613
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:46,160
I remember ordering a pair of those

1614
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,400
for Clark Gable.

1615
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,280
1953.

1616
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:54,920
Right before he did the film <i>Mogambo.</i>

1617
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,360
This is the rarest of shoes.

1618
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:01,440
You see that? You see that?

1619
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:02,800
It's a gold leaf.

1620
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:05,040
You know...

1621
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:07,800
I had to stop doing that.

1622
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:09,680
It got too expensive.

1623
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:14,880
So.

1624
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:18,480
Where did you get that shoe?

1625
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:20,720
Where?

1626
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:24,280
There's no way
you bought that shoe in London.

1627
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:26,360
Who gave it to you?

1628
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:29,600
Would you know?

1629
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,400
My, he doesn't wanna answer.

1630
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:34,720
Well, that's the least...

1631
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,320
This meeting is over.

1632
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:38,760
I broke up the meeting.

1633
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:41,880
Where is he going?

1634
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:43,280
I'm very sorry.

1635
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:44,880
I had no choice.

1636
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:52,120
Aldo.

1637
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:56,480
Did you know this?

1638
01:55:58,920 --> 01:55:59,920
No.

1639
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:02,640
No!

1640
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:08,000
Maurizio.

1641
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:14,640
You fucking traitor.

1642
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:56,600
This is what you want?

1643
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:16,760
Congratulations.

1644
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:23,320
You are now
the majority shareholder...

1645
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:25,960
of Gucci.

1646
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,000
You must feel wonderful.

1647
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:49,040
Boof.

1648
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,400
You need to relax.

1649
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:56,160
Relax. Relax.

1650
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:59,320
You floating.
You floating like in the air.

1651
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:00,400
Floating. Floating.

1652
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,760
From there to there.
Go left to right.

1653
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:07,440
Ms. Wintour, walk into any one of
Gucci's 144 international boutiques

1654
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:09,800
and you will find
you are walking into a new world.

1655
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:11,320
A new vision.

1656
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:16,920
But wasn't the lure of Gucci
precisely its historical appeal?

1657
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:20,720
The legacy is remarkable.

1658
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:21,840
Well, this is true.

1659
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,760
We are products of our past but
we don't have to be prisoners of it.

1660
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:28,120
I don't fear change.

1661
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:29,920
I embrace it.

1662
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:32,360
Where Ralph Lauren stores

1663
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:36,920
they feel like movie sets
and Versace is a rock concert

1664
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:40,640
Gucci stores will feel
like the Vatican of fashion.

1665
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:47,800
<i>Grazie.</i>

1666
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:04,760
How are you funding your vision?

1667
01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:07,360
Well, that is a very good secret.

1668
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:12,040
Don't ask.

1669
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:19,080
It may take some time to recover, but

1670
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:22,040
this is a long-term plan.

1671
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:25,720
Sometimes you have to go down
to come back up again.

1672
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:29,720
Ferre, Armani, and Versace!

1673
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,840
That's who I said I wanted
designing our new line.

1674
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:33,920
And they would be honored
to be working for us.

1675
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:35,640
De Sole, where the fuck are they?

1676
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:39,120
Maurizio, they have their own lines.

1677
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:40,440
They're their own bosses.

1678
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:41,680
I know they have...

1679
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:44,840
I've spoken to everybody.
Nobody wants to...

1680
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:46,800
Then you haven't tried hard enough.

1681
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:49,760
There is someone.

1682
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:51,320
Maybe.

1683
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:52,760
Here.

1684
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:02,720
Who am I looking at?

1685
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,200
He's from Texas.

1686
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:07,560
A mechanic?

1687
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:09,720
Maybe you should meet him.

1688
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:12,400
I see cranked up blacks.

1689
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:14,800
Jewel-tone velvet.

1690
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:19,520
And unconventional styling touches.
Loafers, sans socks.

1691
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:22,200
I see pole dancers
flanking the runways.

1692
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:23,840
Female...

1693
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,360
and male, of course.

1694
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:34,360
I have a vocabulary
that will allow you to expand.

1695
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:36,560
That's what the brand requires.

1696
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:37,920
That's where we need to head.

1697
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:42,560
Without sacrificing the family
character of what this brand is.

1698
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:44,320
The family character is the brand.

1699
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:48,760
I'm here to embellish.
I'm here to resurrect.

1700
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:05,520
Maurizio.

1701
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:09,520
Stop. Please, please, please.
I'm begging you. Please stop.

1702
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:13,400
Okay, I... I don't want
a confrontation.

1703
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:14,800
Me neither.

1704
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:16,280
I tried calling.

1705
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:20,800
Yes, yes, and calling... and calling.

1706
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:22,120
What do you want?

1707
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:24,520
- I want to talk.
- Okay.

1708
02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:27,800
Alessandra misses you.

1709
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:30,320
I saw Alessandra two weeks ago.

1710
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:31,880
She talks about you all the time.

1711
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:34,320
And I'll see her very soon.
I've been very busy.

1712
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:35,920
Will you come back home?

1713
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:41,800
You bought Aldo and Paolo out.
You did what I said.

1714
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:46,240
Good night, Patrizia.

1715
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:48,720
Come back home.

1716
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:56,240
Patrizia, you know that's...
that's not possible.

1717
02:01:57,080 --> 02:01:59,240
Now, it is getting very late.

1718
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:01,240
Go home.

1719
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:03,600
If not for me, just for our daughter.

1720
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:05,280
No... no. Don't do that.

1721
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,360
- Don't...
- Don't...

1722
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,760
I'll take care of her and you.

1723
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:21,480
We made something beautiful together.

1724
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:22,560
No, what?

1725
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:24,680
Take it.

1726
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:26,960
Do you like it?

1727
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:28,520
Patrizia, what is this?

1728
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:29,680
Do you like it?

1729
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:30,800
I made it for you.

1730
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:32,680
You're humiliating yourself.

1731
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:39,560
Why are you talking to me this way?

1732
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:42,320
Because you can't see
what you've become.

1733
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:46,520
This book... A story has
a beginning and an end.

1734
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:48,640
And ours ended a few chapters ago.

1735
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:52,760
So, what do you want from me now?

1736
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:56,480
I want you to myself.

1737
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:58,880
I love you.

1738
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:03,200
Patrizia...

1739
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:06,520
- No.
- I don't love you.

1740
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:09,160
I don't hate you

1741
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:11,880
but I don't want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1742
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:14,760
Now, I'm sorry. I truly am.

1743
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:19,000
What happened to my Maurizio?

1744
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:20,760
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

1745
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:23,920
I had no idea I married a monster.

1746
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,680
You didn't. You married a Gucci.

1747
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:42,880
He's always away on business.

1748
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:44,200
He moved, you know.

1749
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:49,560
I've told you so many times.

1750
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,480
He moved into the penthouse
with that fucking horse.

1751
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:54,280
I've seen them together.

1752
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:58,200
Maybe you should stop following them.

1753
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,320
The things they buy...

1754
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:05,200
Antiques worth billions, cars,
paintings. With our money.

1755
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:07,680
That he has thanks to you.

1756
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:11,240
He's not even a businessman.

1757
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:13,320
He can't even run a parking meter.

1758
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:15,600
How the fuck is he gonna run Gucci?

1759
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:16,680
You're right.

1760
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:18,120
I know.

1761
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:19,920
I made him what he is.

1762
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:22,000
But when you're right, you're right.

1763
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:24,880
And you're very, very right.

1764
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:27,440
I'm gonna go see him tomorrow.

1765
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:33,160
Maybe you should wait until
we come back from the Caymans.

1766
02:04:33,680 --> 02:04:35,120
And then we can...

1767
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:38,200
we can do a nice evil eye on him.

1768
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:42,240
Another spell?

1769
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:48,160
We've run out of spells.

1770
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:52,600
We need something stronger.

1771
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:03,280
Maybe I can still do something
that will work.

1772
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:07,200
But for that,
you have to be positive.

1773
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:19,480
I am being very fucking positive.

1774
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:24,320
<i>You are a waste of skin</i>

1775
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:27,760
<i>that belongs on the front page
of every newspaper.</i>

1776
02:05:29,120 --> 02:05:31,680
<i>I want the world to know
what you're really like.</i>

1777
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:36,320
<i>I will not give you
a minute of peace.</i>

1778
02:05:38,440 --> 02:05:41,840
<i>You tried to crush me,
but you couldn't.</i>

1779
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:47,800
<i>You are a painful appendage
that needs to be removed.</i>

1780
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:51,560
<i>The inferno for you is yet to come.</i>

1781
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:55,800
<i>Ciao,</i> Pina.

1782
02:05:57,800 --> 02:05:59,920
- Two, Rita.
- Where the fuck are they?

1783
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:03,600
If I knew how to use a pistol,
I'd fucking do this shit myself.

1784
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:05,200
Calm down. Calm down.

1785
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:13,560
They'll show up.

1786
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:14,960
Come sit.

1787
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:30,600
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1788
02:06:39,320 --> 02:06:40,320
Pina.

1789
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:56,640
Yeah. Ivano, I told Patrizia that
I know you since you were a child.

1790
02:06:57,880 --> 02:06:59,200
That we trust you.

1791
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:02,240
I am Ivano Savioni.

1792
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:04,960
This is my associate
Benedetto Ceraulo.

1793
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:14,040
Who does what?

1794
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:16,800
Sicilian.

1795
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:19,880
How soon can you do it?

1796
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:25,000
As soon as we know
his routine and his security.

1797
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:27,400
And we are set on our rate.

1798
02:07:29,560 --> 02:07:31,680
Our rate? What rate?

1799
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:36,200
- What is that?
- You told me six.

1800
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,200
Yeah, yeah.

1801
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:40,480
- Are you crazy?
- Why is he saying eight?

1802
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:42,496
- I don't what he's playing.
- Why the fuck is he saying eight?

1803
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:44,136
- No, I don't know. No, it's six.
- We said eight.

1804
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:46,000
- 600 million lire.
- We said eight.

1805
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:47,520
That's it. What are you doing?

1806
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:48,800
Keep your fucking voice down.

1807
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:50,496
- We said eight.
- I'd consider it

1808
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:51,800
- if only it was eight.
- Yeah.

1809
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:55,600
Somebody else quoted me for far less.

1810
02:07:56,880 --> 02:07:58,280
Six is all I'm willing to do.

1811
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:00,560
It will have to be a rush job then.

1812
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:01,640
Yeah.

1813
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:05,080
And you have to provide us now
with photographs.

1814
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:08,400
Six is all I will pay.

1815
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,480
We'll give you half now...

1816
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:13,760
half later when it's done.

1817
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:16,480
Okay.

1818
02:08:17,120 --> 02:08:18,120
Okay.

1819
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:22,400
Don't miss.

1820
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,040
Deal with her.

1821
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:32,960
Really.

1822
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:35,520
You don't wanna make any mistakes.

1823
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:37,520
Catch.

1824
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:42,520
Pay for the coffee
and don't fuck this up.

1825
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:44,400
'Cause I'll put a spell on you.

1826
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:54,680
Ready.

1827
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:00,440
Wait.

1828
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:21,960
That's amazing.

1829
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:24,400
I think he's incredible. Love him.

1830
02:09:35,120 --> 02:09:36,960
Are you sure this is a Gucci show?

1831
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:38,040
Yeah, yeah.

1832
02:09:38,280 --> 02:09:42,040
Very nice, this jacket,
we've talked about for months.

1833
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:45,360
It's beautiful. I love it.

1834
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:47,040
You're in for a surprise.

1835
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,040
Very modern.

1836
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:13,120
Very interesting.

1837
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:15,760
Three, two, one. Go!

1838
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:22,880
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

1839
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:30,760
He looks great.

1840
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:39,760
Bravo!

1841
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:42,200
Bravo!

1842
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:52,160
"When Tom Ford took over
the creative reins of Gucci in 1994

1843
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:55,600
there was little hope for
the Milanese fashion house."

1844
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:00,680
"It took a German designer
to stir up Chanel"

1845
02:11:01,400 --> 02:11:04,000
and it is an American
who has put Gucci far and away

1846
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:05,560
"in the front of fashion."

1847
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:12,600
"Some say Mr. Ford will give
Mr. Lagerfeld a run for his money."

1848
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:20,240
I have to call my mother in Austin.

1849
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:36,760
Watch what you say, he's here.

1850
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:48,200
What an unforgettable night.

1851
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:49,680
Maurizio.

1852
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,760
And the response is incredible.

1853
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:54,880
I've never seen anything like it.

1854
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:57,880
Indeed. It marks
a new chapter for Gucci.

1855
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:01,760
Hey, try the carpaccio.
It melts in your mouth.

1856
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:02,840
Okay.

1857
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:06,960
Don't say anything
while I talk to him.

1858
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:08,920
- (Arabic)
- I'll call on you when you can talk.

1859
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:14,656
I think we can all be honest with
each other around this table, yeah?

1860
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:15,800
We're all friends here.

1861
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:18,200
We can... we all respect each other.

1862
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:20,280
<i>Grazie.</i>

1863
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:24,440
We're very concerned.

1864
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:28,000
What concerns you?

1865
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:29,760
Numbers.

1866
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:32,160
Specifically, Gucci's.

1867
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:36,240
Well, you said you didn't care
about numbers.

1868
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:38,200
That you trusted your instinct.

1869
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:41,680
Yeah. I care about numbers
when they're terrible numbers.

1870
02:12:44,080 --> 02:12:47,400
Our projections for 1996 are abysmal.

1871
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:50,120
By slashing hundreds
of profitable items...

1872
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:52,320
You mean my uncle's knickknacks?

1873
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:59,560
Losses are likely to
total $30 million this year on sales

1874
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:01,720
of $180 million.

1875
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:05,000
Down from $210 million in 1991.

1876
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:08,560
And $270 million.

1877
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:11,680
There is $85 million in bank debts.

1878
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:14,360
We may even have trouble

1879
02:13:14,440 --> 02:13:16,560
paying salaries
for the next couple of months.

1880
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:20,400
Profits remain elusive.

1881
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:21,480
And I've always said that

1882
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:23,880
our strategic plan
would take five years.

1883
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:27,440
It's not about immediate profit.
You go down to come back up again.

1884
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:29,240
That is how you get out of a stall.

1885
02:13:29,640 --> 02:13:31,920
But the personal items
are a concern as well.

1886
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,840
All paid for through Gucci's accounts
and charged as expenses.

1887
02:13:36,920 --> 02:13:39,400
The multimillion-dollar antiques
in the stores.

1888
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:40,800
The purchase of countless cars

1889
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:43,880
including a Ferrari F40
and a Lamborghini Countach.

1890
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:47,080
$3 million on a watch,
a Patek Philippe 2523.

1891
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:50,200
$7 million on a luxury penthouse.
I could go on and on.

1892
02:13:50,560 --> 02:13:53,080
An 18th century palatial villa
outside Florence

1893
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:54,760
for use as a training center.

1894
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:57,200
I have justifications
for all of these things

1895
02:13:57,320 --> 02:13:59,840
but it doesn't seem that
you're in a place to hear them.

1896
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:03,880
Maurizio, please try and take this
in the spirit of our friendship.

1897
02:14:05,120 --> 02:14:06,520
We've been through a lot together.

1898
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:09,520
You have many qualities.

1899
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:11,840
But we must be realistic.

1900
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:13,320
You're not a natural manager.

1901
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:18,360
You can't run a business
purely on charm and eccentricities.

1902
02:14:18,440 --> 02:14:20,640
No. You need time as well.

1903
02:14:23,320 --> 02:14:25,200
Last night does mark
a new chapter for Gucci

1904
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:26,776
and I am the one
that brought it to you.

1905
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:29,320
Maurizio, I want you to understand

1906
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:33,080
whatever happens between
both of our companies

1907
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:37,880
I have never stopped
respecting you or your vision.

1908
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:41,680
But I have vision for my people too.

1909
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:43,840
And I have a business to run.

1910
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:55,200
We want to offer you $150 million
for your 50% stake in Gucci.

1911
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:57,160
You want to buy me out.

1912
02:14:57,560 --> 02:14:59,200
We want to save the business.

1913
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:02,240
And who would be appointed CEO?

1914
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:15,040
She was right about you.

1915
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:21,360
$150 million.

1916
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:22,800
You'll be a rich man.

1917
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:24,400
If you really think it's about money

1918
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:26,920
then you know less about Gucci
than I thought.

1919
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,640
Hurry up and eat, boys.

1920
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:47,200
I've never tasted
such good meat in my life.

1921
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:50,720
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

1922
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:53,000
This meat. Where is it coming from?

1923
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:55,120
This is the finest beef in Tuscany.

1924
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:57,040
It comes from the Val di Chiana.

1925
02:15:57,320 --> 02:15:59,040
The cows are treated like royalty.

1926
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:23,400
That's him.

1927
02:19:23,600 --> 02:19:25,200
- Good morning.
- <i>Ciao.</i>

1928
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:39,280
<i>Signor</i> Gucci?

1929
02:19:57,360 --> 02:19:58,480
What's going on?

1930
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:13,600
Patrizia.

1931
02:22:23,320 --> 02:22:24,320
I know.

1932
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:36,400
Please see <i>Signorina</i> Franchi
out of my house.

1933
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:36,920
<i>Signora</i> Reggiani.

1934
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:42,360
<i>Signora</i> Reggiani.

1935
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:47,960
<i>Signora</i> Reggiani.

1936
02:23:55,320 --> 02:23:58,800
You can call me <i>Signora</i> Gucci.
