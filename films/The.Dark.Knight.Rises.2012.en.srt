1
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,564
<i>GORDON“.
I knew Harvey Dent.</i>

2
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,899
<i>I was his friend.</i>

3
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:14,241
And it will be a very long time before
someone inspires us the way he did.

4
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,579
I believed in Harvey Dent.

5
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,434
Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.

6
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,643
He wasn't alone.

7
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,856
- Uh, you don't get to bring friends.
- They are not my friends.

8
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,025
Don't worry, no charge for them.

9
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,987
- And why would I want them?
- They were trying to grab your prize.

10
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,822
They work for the mercenary.

11
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,866
The masked man.

12
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,910
- Bane?
- Aye.

13
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,663
Get them onboard. I'll call it in.

14
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,591
The flight plan I just filed
with the agency...

15
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,970
...lists me, my men, Dr. Pavel here...

16
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,348
...but only one of you!

17
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:26,647
First one to talk gets to stay on my aircraft!

18
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,240
Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel?

19
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,373
He didn't fly so good!

20
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,541
Who wants to try next?

21
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,127
Tell me about Bane!

22
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,796
Why does he wear the mask?

23
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,967
A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!

24
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,805
Well, perhaps he's wondering
why someone would shoot a man...

25
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,100
...before throwing him out of a plane.

26
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,772
At least you can talk.

27
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,065
Who are you?

28
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,693
It doesn't matter who we are.

29
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,320
What matters is our plan.

30
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,080
No one cared who I was
till I put on the mask.

31
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,667
If I pull that off, will you die?

32
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,002
It would be extremely painful.

33
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,337
You're a big guy.

34
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,714
For you.

35
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,886
Was getting caught part of your plan?

36
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,555
Of course.

37
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:50,021
Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours.

38
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,692
- We had to find out what he told you--
- Nothing. I said nothing.

39
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,625
Well, congratulations,
you got yourself caught!

40
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,212
- Sir?
- Now what's the next step of your master plan?

41
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,798
Crashing this plane...

42
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,638
...with no survivors.

43
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,038
Mayday, Mayday!

44
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,462
Aah! What you doing to me? Let me out!

45
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,800
No!

46
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,094
No, no, no! No!

47
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,567
No! They expect one of us
in the wreckage, brother.

48
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,195
Have we started the fire?

49
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,949
Yes, the fire rises.

50
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,461
Calm down, doctor.
Now is not the time for fear.

51
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,839
That comes later.

52
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,244
<i>Harvey Dent Day
may not be our oldest public holiday...</i>

53
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,456
<i>...but we're here tonight
because it's one of the most important.</i>

54
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,752
<i>Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
against organized crime...</i>

55
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,048
...had made Gotham a safer place than it was
at the time of his death, eight years ago.

56
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,384
This city has seen a historic turnaround.

57
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:11,890
No city is without crime, but this city is without
organized crime because the Dent Act...

58
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,268
...gave law enforcement teeth
in its fight against the mob.

59
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,105
Now people are talking about
repealing the Dent Act...

60
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,275
...and to them I say, "Not on my watch."

61
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,529
I want to thank the Wayne Foundation
for hosting this event.

62
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:30,825
I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here tonight.
I'm sure he's with us in spirit.

63
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,745
And now I'm gonna give way
to an important voice...

64
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,373
You ever lay eyes on Wayne
at one of these things?

65
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,249
No one has. Not in years.

66
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,295
people put their faith
in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape.

67
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,007
A thug who showed his true nature...

68
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,635
...when he betrayed the trust
of this great man...

69
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,304
...and murdered him in cold blood.

70
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,391
Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow.

71
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,559
- Shrimp balls?
- Thank you.

72
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,188
Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about
Harvey Dent. I'll let him tell you himself.

73
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,815
Commissioner Gordon.

74
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,617
The truth?

75
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,832
I have...

76
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,751
...written a speech...

77
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,755
...telling the truth about Harvey Dent.

78
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,887
Maybe the time isn't right.

79
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,269
Maybe right now...

80
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,063
...all you need to know
is that there are...

81
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:47,027
...1000 inmates in Blackgate Prison
as a direct result of the Dent Act.

82
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:52,115
These are violent criminals, essential cogs
in the organized-crime machine.

83
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:57,203
Maybe, for now, all I should say
about the death of Harvey Dent is this:

84
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,709
It has not been for nothing.

85
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,714
- You see the guy who owns the house?
<i>- No. I heard...</i>

86
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,842
- ...he never leaves the east wing.
- I heard he had an accident.

87
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,763
- Yeah, that he's disfigured. He has to wear a--
- Mr. Till?

88
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,641
Why are your people
using the main staircase?

89
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,144
And where's Mrs. Bolton?

90
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,022
Uh, she's at the bar, sir. Can I help?

91
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,398
The east drawing room.

92
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:30,570
Unlock the door, put the tray on the table,
lock the door again. Nothing more.

93
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,993
<i>I'm sorry, Miss Tate.
I tried, but he won't see you.</i>

94
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,162
And you mustn't take it personally.

95
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:43,333
Everyone knows that Wayne's holed up
in there with 8-inch nails...

96
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,168
...peeing into Mason jars.

97
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,712
It's very good of you
to let me on the grounds.

98
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,394
Why are you wasting your time
trying to talk to a man...

99
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:08,274
...who threw away your investment
on some save-the-world vanity project?

100
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,693
He can't get your money back. I can.

101
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:15,865
I could try explaining that
a save-the-world project, vain or not...

102
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,451
...is worth investing in, Mr. Daggett.

103
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,788
But you understand only money
and the power you think it buys...

104
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,916
...so why waste my time indeed?

105
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,960
<i>Second shift reports in?</i>

106
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,212
You should spend more time
with the mayor.

107
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,256
Well, that's your department.

108
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,050
Anyone shown him the crime stats?

109
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,512
He goes by his gut and it bothers him,
no matter what the numbers.

110
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,558
- Must be popular with his wife.
- Not really. She took the kids to Cleveland.

111
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,937
He'll have plenty of time for visits.
The mayor's gonna dump him in the spring.

112
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,647
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

113
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,693
- But he's a hero.
- A war hero. This is peacetime.

114
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:25,226
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.

115
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,355
It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

116
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:37,197
Although you don't have the long nails
or, heh, the facial scars, sir.

117
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,200
Is that what they say about me?

118
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,453
It's just that no one ever sees you.

119
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,832
That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me
of one that belonged to my mother.

120
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:51,085
It can't be the same one...

121
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:54,756
...because her pearls are in this safe...

122
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,093
...the manufacturer clearly explained...

123
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,598
...is uncrackable.

124
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,605
Oops.

125
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,982
Nobody told me it was uncrackable.

126
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,153
I'm afraid I can't let you take those.

127
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,282
Look, you wouldn't beat up a woman
any more than I would beat up a cripple.

128
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,162
Of course, sometimes
exceptions have to be made.

129
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,503
Good night, Mr. Wayne.

130
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,061
Can I have a ride?

131
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,729
You read my mind.

132
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,065
Let's go.

133
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,859
Miss Tate was asking to see you again.

134
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,653
She's very persistent.

135
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,155
And quite lovely,
in case you were wondering.

136
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,491
- I wasn't.
- What are you doing?

137
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,953
Examining print dust.
We've been robbed.

138
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,081
And this is your idea
of, uh, sounding the alarm, is it?

139
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,417
She took the pearls,
tracking device and all.

140
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,876
- She?
- One of the maids.

141
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,671
Perhaps you should stop letting them
in this side of the house.

142
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,299
Perhaps you should start learning
to make your own bed.

143
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,386
- Why were you dusting for prints?
- I wasn't.

144
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,722
She was.

145
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,061
Sir. Congressman Gilly's wife
has been calling in.

146
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,107
The congressman never made it home
after the Wayne Foundation event.

147
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,443
That's a job for the police?

148
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,446
When you and Dent cleaned the streets,
you cleaned them good.

149
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,408
Pretty soon we'll be chasing down, uh,
overdue library books.

150
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,331
And yet here you are, like we're still at war.

151
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,543
- What's your name, son?
- Blake, sir.

152
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,503
You have something you want to ask me?

153
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:03,092
It's about that night. This night,
eight years ago. The night Dent died.

154
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,219
The last confirmed sighting of the Batman.

155
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,473
He murders those people,
takes down two SWAT teams...

156
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,393
...breaks Dent's neck
and then just vanishes?

157
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,188
I'm not hearing a question, son.

158
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,315
Don't you want to know who he was?

159
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,610
I know exactly who he was.

160
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,572
He was the Batman.

161
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,535
Let's go see about the congressman's wife.

162
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,837
Master Wayne?

163
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,591
Master Wayne?

164
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,833
You haven't been down here in a long time.

165
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,545
Trying to find out more about
our jewel thief. I ran her prints.

166
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,505
Unless she's lost a lot of weight...

167
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,134
...she was wearing
someone else's fingerprints.

168
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,427
She's good.

169
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,139
She may be, but we have a trace
on the necklace.

170
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,933
We do. I cross-referenced the address
she went back to...

171
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,687
...with police data
on high-end B-and-E's, and, um...

172
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,939
Selina Kyle.

173
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,944
The databases are full of close-calls,
tips from fences.

174
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,115
She's good, but the ground
is shrinking beneath her feet.

175
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,034
We should send the police
before she fences the pearls.

176
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,412
She won't. She likes them too much.

177
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,372
And they weren't what she was after.

178
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,624
- What was she after?
- My fingerprints.

179
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,794
It was printer toner
mixed with graphite on the safe.

180
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,547
It gives a good pull and it's untraceable.

181
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,550
Fascinating. You two should
exchange notes over coffee.

182
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,011
You're trying to set me up with a jewel thief?

183
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:14,640
At this point, I'd set you up with a chimpanzee,
if it brought you back to the world.

184
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,059
There's nothing out there for me.

185
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,811
And that's the problem.

186
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,522
You hung up your cape and your cowl
but you didn't move on.

187
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,983
You never went to find a life.
To find someone.

188
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,526
Alfred...

189
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,321
...I did find someone.

190
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,906
I know, and you lost them.

191
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,033
But that's all part of living, sir.

192
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,329
But you're not living, you're just waiting,
hoping for things to go bad again.

193
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,997
Remember when you left Gotham?

194
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,167
Before all this, before Batman?

195
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:42,960
YOU were gone seven years.

196
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,715
Seven years I waited,
hoping that you wouldn't come back.

197
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,511
Every year, I took a holiday.
I went to Florence.

198
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,930
<i>There's this café
on the banks of the Arno.</i>

199
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,350
Every fine evening I'd sit there
and order a Fernet Branca.

200
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,394
I had this fantasy...

201
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,190
...that I would look across the tables...

202
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,319
<i>...and I'd see you there, with a wife.</i>

203
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,321
<i>Maybe a couple of kids.</i>

204
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,285
You wouldn't say anything to me,
nor me to you.

205
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,290
But we'd both know that you'd made it.

206
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,793
That you were happy.

207
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,383
I never wanted you to come back to Gotham.

208
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:36,055
I always knew there was nothing here
for you, except pain and tragedy.

209
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,100
And I wanted something
more for you than that.

210
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,439
I still do.

211
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,530
<i>They wash up here
a couple of times a month.</i>

212
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,156
<i>More when it gets colder.</i>

213
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,284
Homeless, sheltering in the tunnels.

214
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:02,081
We pulled him from the basin,
but other than that we didn't touch him.

215
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,085
- What?
- Name's Jimmy.

216
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,670
He's from St. Swithin's.

217
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:12,216
It's the boys' home
where I coach some ball.

218
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,721
<i>Jimmy hadn't been around for months.</i>

219
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,390
- No? Why?
- Blake, you know why.

220
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:23,394
He aged out. We don't have the resources
to keep boys on after 16.

221
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,646
I thought the Wayne Foundation
gave money for that.

222
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,898
Not for the past couple of years.

223
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,902
- He has a brother here, doesn't he?
- Mark. I'll tell him.

224
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,072
I'd like to, if that's all right.

225
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,284
You know what he was doing
in the tunnels?

226
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:42,288
Lot of guys been going down the tunnels
when they age out.

227
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,667
Say you can live down there.

228
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,878
Say there's work down there.

229
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,546
Work?

230
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,507
What kind of work are you
gonna find in the sewers?

231
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,302
More than you can find up here, I guess.

232
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,429
So you know about him?

233
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,847
Of course.

234
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,351
Do you think he's coming back?

235
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,854
I don't know.

236
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,244
You brought a date?

237
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,623
I like having someone around
to open doors for me.

238
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,752
Right hand. No partials.

239
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,133
- Very nice.
- Mm-hm.

240
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,011
Not so fast, handsome.

241
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,554
You got something for me?

242
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,641
Ah, yes.

243
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,320
I don't know what you're planning to do
with Mr. Wayne's prints...

244
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,281
...but I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.

245
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,159
You don't count so good, huh?

246
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,577
I count fine.

247
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,164
In fact, I'm counting to 10 right now.

248
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,668
Okay.

249
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,466
My friend's outside. Just hit "send."

250
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,563
This place is a little dead.

251
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,983
It'll liven up in a minute. Trust me.

252
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,694
Is everything okay?

253
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,863
Great. Catch you later.

254
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,869
Hmm.

255
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,872
It would have been a lot easier...

256
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,249
...to just give me what we agreed.

257
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,835
We can't have loose ends.

258
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,839
And even in that dress,
no one's gonna miss you.

259
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,507
No.

260
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,551
But my friend over there?

261
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,888
Every cop in the city's missing him.

262
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,389
That's cute.

263
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,267
But they're not gonna be looking
in a place like this.

264
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,353
I don't know.
You did just use his cell phone.

265
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,948
- Go!
- Go!

266
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,925
Police! Get down now!

267
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,346
Help me! Help me!

268
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,556
Help me, please! Please help me!

269
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,361
Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart.

270
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,073
Call me?

271
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,328
- You okay, miss?
- He's bleeding. You gotta help him.

272
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,709
I got the congressman.

273
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:45,948
Clear!

274
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:54,039
Manhole! Get this up!
Get the DWP down here!

275
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,542
You three, down with me.

276
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:00,129
You two, you go down,
cover the next exit!

277
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,147
What, they went down there?

278
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,765
- We're gonna go down there, right?
- That was a gas explosion, kid.

279
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,185
- Wasn't gas. It's a sewer.
- No one goes in till we know what's there.

280
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,187
We know, sir. The police commissioner.

281
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,189
Someone get this hothead out of here?

282
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,858
And where's that DWP guy?

283
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,444
Why are you here?

284
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,781
Answer him.

285
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,368
I was asking you.

286
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,286
It's the police commissioner.

287
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,543
And you brought him down here?

288
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,796
- We didn't know what to do.
- You panicked.

289
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,299
And your weakness has cost the lives
of three others.

290
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,592
No, he's alone.

291
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,015
Search him.

292
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,725
Then I will kill you.

293
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,174
- He's dead.
- 80 show me his body.

294
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,761
The water runs to any one of the outflows.
We'd never find him.

295
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,977
- Follow him!
- Follow him?

296
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,536
You okay? You okay?

297
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,622
Hey, hey, you awake?

298
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,880
I need to see Bruce Wayne.

299
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,508
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take
unscheduled calls.

300
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,468
Even from a police officer.

301
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,305
And if I go get a warrant for
the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder?

302
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,682
That still count as unscheduled?

303
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,897
What can I do for you, officer?

304
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,316
Commissioner Gordon's been shot.

305
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,695
He chased a gunman
down into the sewers.

306
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,199
When I pulled him out, he was babbling
about an underground army.

307
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,201
A masked man called Bane.

308
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,371
Shouldn't you be telling
your superior officers?

309
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,624
They asked me if he saw
any giant alligators.

310
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,793
He needs you.

311
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,671
He needs the Batman.

312
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:16,218
- If Commissioner Gordon thinks--
- Oh, he doesn't know or care who you are.

313
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,971
But we've met before.

314
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:24,226
It was a long time ago. I was a kid.
Uh, St. Swithin's.

315
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,605
It used to be funded by
the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage.

316
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:33,694
My mom died when I was small. It was
a car accident, I don't really remember it.

317
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,491
But my dad got shot a couple years later
over a gambling debt...

318
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,995
...and I remember that one just fine.

319
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,249
Not a lot of people know
what it feels like, do they?

320
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,376
To be angry...

321
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,962
...in your bones.

322
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,675
I mean, they understand.

323
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,677
Foster parents.

324
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,846
Everybody understands...

325
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,639
...for a while.

326
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,102
And then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he can't do.

327
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,770
Move on.

328
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,315
So after a while,
they stop understanding.

329
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,358
They send the angry kid to a boys' home.

330
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:17,529
I figured it out too late.
You gotta learn to hide the anger.

331
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,574
Practice smiling in a mirror.

332
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,911
It's like putting on a mask.

333
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,707
So you showed up this one day,
in a cool car.

334
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,709
Pretty girl on your arm.

335
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,587
We were so excited.

336
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,465
Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan.

337
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:40,677
I mean, we used to make up stories
about you, man. Legends.

338
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,640
And, you know, with the other kids,
that's all it was, just stories, but...

339
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,518
Right when I saw you,
I knew who you really were.

340
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,773
I'd seen that look on your face before.

341
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,943
It's the same one I taught myself.

342
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,781
I don't know why you took the fall
for Dent's murder...

343
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,700
...but I'm still a believer in the Batman...

344
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,203
...even if you're not.

345
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:13,835
Why did you say that your boys' home used
to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?

346
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,754
Because the money stopped.

347
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:20,133
Might be time to get some fresh air.
Start paying attention to the details.

348
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,387
Some of those details
might need your help.

349
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,515
You check that name? Bane?

350
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,351
He's a mercenary.
No other known names.

351
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,979
Him and his men were behind
a coup in West Africa...

352
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:36,650
...that secured mining operations
for our friend John Daggett.

353
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,153
- Now Daggett's brought them here.
- Or so it seems.

354
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,366
- I'll keep digging.
- Yeah.

355
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:51,790
Alfred, why did the Wayne Foundation
stop funding boys' homes in the city?

356
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:57,045
The foundation is funded by
the profits of Wayne Enterprises.

357
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,922
There have to be some.

358
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:02,426
- Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
- I'll get him on the phone.

359
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:06,596
No, no, no. Do we still have
any cars around the place?

360
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,640
Yes. One or two.

361
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,809
I need an appointment at the hospital
for my leg.

362
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,729
- Which hospital?
- Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

363
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,902
- I have seen worse cartilage in knees.
- That's good.

364
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,572
No. That's because there is
no cartilage in your knee.

365
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:27,075
And not much of any use
in your elbows or your shoulders.

366
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,619
Between that and the scar tissue
on your kidneys...

367
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,456
...the residual concussive damage
to your brain tissue...

368
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,292
...and the general scarred-over quality
of your body...

369
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:38,378
- ...I cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing.
- Right.

370
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,355
We were in this together...

371
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,025
...then you were gone.

372
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,319
The Batman wasn't needed anymore.

373
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:05,614
- We won.
- Based on a lie.

374
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:13,121
And now there's evil rising
from where we tried to bury it.

375
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,793
The Batman has to come back.

376
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,420
What if he doesn't exist anymore?

377
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,880
He must.

378
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,049
He must.

379
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,606
You took my goddamn wallet, didn't you?

380
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,651
- You f—- You took my wallet!
- No, I--

381
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,570
- Get out.
- She took my-- Ah!

382
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,323
- Now.
- Creep!

383
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,410
I don't know what he's so upset about.
There's only 60 bucks in here.

384
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,328
Probably the watch.

385
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,636
Who's that?

386
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,930
A stiff can barely climb out of his sports car.

387
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,224
- No, that's Bruce Wayne!
- Mr. Wayne, over here!

388
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,648
- I'm not sure if my assistant--
- Right through here.

389
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,316
Thank you so much.

390
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:32,367
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball.

391
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,287
Miss Tate, isn't it?

392
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,332
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these things.

393
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,170
The proceeds go to the big fat spread.
It's not about charity.

394
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:47,674
It's about feeding the ego
of whichever society hag laid this on.

395
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,594
Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne.

396
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,429
Oh.

397
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:57,934
And the proceeds will go where they should,
because I paid for the big fat spread myself.

398
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,728
That's very generous of you.

399
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,815
You have to invest if you want to restore
balance to the world.

400
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,734
Take our clean-energy project.

401
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,904
Sometimes the investment
doesn't pay off.

402
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,366
- I'm sorry.
- You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne.

403
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:18,663
But a man who doesn't care about the world
doesn't spend half his fortune to save it.

404
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,667
And isn't so wounded when it fails...

405
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,711
...that he goes into hiding.

406
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,256
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.

407
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,970
Mind if I cut in?

408
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,890
Thank you.

409
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,938
- You don't seem happy to see me.
- You were supposed to be a shut-in.

410
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,981
I felt like some fresh air.

411
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,901
Why didn't you call the police?

412
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,904
I have a powerful friend
who deals with things like this.

413
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:55,367
That's a brazen costume for a cat burglar.

414
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,495
Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?

415
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,373
Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

416
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,459
<i>- Who's</i> your date?
- His wife's in Ibiza.

417
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:08,421
She left her diamonds behind, though.
Worried they might get stolen.

418
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,632
It's pronounced "Ibiza."

419
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,886
You wouldn't want these folks realizing
you're a crook, not a social climber.

420
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,181
You think I care what anyone
in this room thinks of me?

421
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,185
I doubt you care what anyone
in any room thinks of you.

422
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:26,064
Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne.
You don't know a thing about me.

423
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,902
Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here
from your walk-up in Old Town.

424
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,904
A modest place for a master jewel thief.

425
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,366
Which means that either
you're saving for retirement...

426
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,077
...or you're in deep with the wrong people.

427
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:44,374
You don't get to judge me because you were
born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.

428
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,878
- Actually, I was born in the Regency Room.
- I started out doing what I had to.

429
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,425
Once you've done what you had to,
they never let you do what you want to.

430
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:54,843
Start fresh.

431
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,221
Ugh. There's no fresh start in today's world.

432
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:01,433
Any 12-year-old with a cell phone
could find out what you did.

433
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,395
Everything we do is collated
and quantified. Everything sticks.

434
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,981
Is that how you justify stealing?

435
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:10,734
I take what I need from those
who have more than enough.

436
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,194
I don't stand on the shoulders
of people with less.

437
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,404
Robin Hood?

438
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:18,700
I think I'd do more to help someone than
most of the people in this room. Than you.

439
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,745
You think maybe you're assuming
a little too much?

440
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,957
Maybe you're being unrealistic about what's
really in your pants other than your wallet.

441
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,167
Ouch.

442
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:32,756
You think all this can last?
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

443
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,594
You and your friends better batten down
the hatches, because when it hits...

444
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:41,640
...you're all gonna wonder how you
ever thought you could live so large...

445
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,893
...and leave so little for the rest of us.

446
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,690
You sound like
you're looking forward to it.

447
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,693
I'm adaptable.

448
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,113
Those pearls do look better on you
than they did in my safe.

449
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,075
But I still can't let you keep them.

450
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,918
You-- You scared her off!

451
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,381
Not likely.

452
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,884
Must have lost my ticket.

453
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,804
- Your wife said you were taking a cab home.
- My wife?

454
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,271
Just you, sir?

455
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,360
Don't worry, Master Wayne.

456
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,155
Takes a little time to get back
in the swing of things.

457
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,577
Bruce Wayne, as I live and breathe.

458
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,748
What brings you out of cryo-sleep,
Mr. Wayne?

459
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,667
You haven't lost your sense of humor.

460
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,336
Even if you have lost most of my money.

461
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,004
Actually, you did that.

462
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,882
If you funnel your entire R and D budget...

463
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,969
...into a fusion project
that you then mothball...

464
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,471
...your company is unlikely to thrive.

465
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,681
What are my options?

466
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,225
Well, if you're unwilling
to turn on the machine...

467
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,936
I can't. I can't, Lucius.

468
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,063
Well, then sit tight.

469
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,940
Your majority keeps Daggett at bay...

470
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:18,111
...while we figure out a future for
the energy program with Miranda Tate.

471
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,905
She has supported the project
all the way.

472
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,492
She's smart. And quite lovely.

473
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,538
We all just want what's best for you, Bruce.

474
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,040
Show her the machine.

475
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,251
I'll think it over.

476
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,753
Anything else?

477
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,172
Nope. Why?

478
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:41,384
These conversations used to end
with an unusual request.

479
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,553
I retired.

480
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:47,932
Mm—hm. Well, let me show you
some stuff anyway.

481
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,563
Just for old times' sake.

482
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,069
I figured you'd have
shut this place down.

483
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,906
Oh, it was always shut down, officially.

484
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,157
All this new stuff.

485
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:08,953
After your father died, Wayne Enterprises
set up 14 different defense subsidiaries.

486
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,790
For years, I've been shuttering
and consolidating...

487
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,334
...all the different prototypes
under one roof.

488
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,211
- My roof.
—Why?

489
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,172
Keep them from falling
into the wrong hands.

490
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,427
Oh, now you're just showing off.

491
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:30,225
Defense Department projects
for tight geometry urban pacification.

492
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:35,313
Rotors are configured to maneuver
between buildings without recirculation.

493
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,273
What's it called?

494
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:42,111
Oh, it has a long, uninteresting
Wayne Enterprises designation.

495
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,657
I just took to calling it the Bat.

496
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,202
And, yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.

497
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,957
Works fine, except for the autopilot.

498
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,334
Takes a better mind than mine to fix it.

499
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,877
Better mind?

500
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:01,422
Well, I was trying to be modest.

501
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,716
A less busy mind.

502
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,426
Yours.

503
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:16,437
- Is it really painful?
- You're very welcome to try it, Alfred.

504
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,314
Happy watching. Thank you, sir.

505
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,861
Not bad.

506
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,325
Not bad at all.

507
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,915
If you're seriously considering
going back out there...

508
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,209
...you should hear the rumors
surrounding Bane.

509
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,419
I'm all ears.

510
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,424
There is a prison
in a more ancient part of the world.

511
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:49,804
A pit where men are thrown
to suffer and die.

512
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:53,725
But sometimes
a man rises from the darkness.

513
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:58,104
Sometimes the pit sends something back.

514
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,398
- Bane.
- Bane.

515
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,735
Born and raised in hell on earth.

516
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:07,822
- Born in a prison?
- No one knows why, or how he escaped.

517
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,575
But they do know that once he did...

518
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:14,913
...he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul,
your mentor.

519
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,081
Bane was a member
of the League of Shadows?

520
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,417
And then he was excommunicated.

521
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:25,590
And any man who is too extreme
for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with.

522
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:29,010
I didn't realize I was known
for trifling with criminals.

523
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,929
That was then.

524
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,182
And you can strap up your leg
and put your mask back on...

525
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,935
...but that doesn't make you
what you were.

526
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:41,731
If this man is everything that you say he is,
then the city needs me.

527
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,859
The city needs Bruce Wayne.

528
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,153
Your resources. Your knowledge.

529
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,406
It doesn't need your body, or your life.

530
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,367
That time's past.

531
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,912
You're afraid that if I go back out there,
I'll fail.

532
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,330
No.

533
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,793
I'm afraid that you want to.

534
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,477
You can't short the stock because
Bruce Wayne goes to a party.

535
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:23,481
Wayne coming back is change.
Change is either good or bad. I vote bad.

536
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,941
On what basis?

537
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,651
I flipped a coin.

538
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,701
It says rye-- I said no rye, man.

539
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,081
Hey, rookie, lose the helmet.
We need faces for camera.

540
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,047
Come on. Let's go scalping.

541
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,522
Come on.

542
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,466
Everybody down, now!

543
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,487
This is a stock exchange.
There's no money you can steal.

544
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,032
Really? Then why are you people here?

545
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:15,259
Everybody, stay back!
Go down to the end of the block!

546
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,386
We have an emergency situation!

547
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,266
You gotta get in there!

548
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,018
This is a hostage situation.

549
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,605
No, this is a robbery. They have
direct access to the online trading desk.

550
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,565
I'm not risking my men for your money.

551
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,155
We have to ask you to move.
We have a situation.

552
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,366
It's not our money, it's everybody's.

553
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,618
Really? Mine's in my mattress.

554
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:45,289
You don't put these guys down, that stuffing in
your mattress might be worth a whole lot less.

555
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,708
Cut the fiber cable
and take out that cell tower.

556
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,378
- Thank you.
- That'll slow them down.

557
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,088
Move back!

558
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,924
All the way! Go! Sir, get back, please!

559
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,010
They cut the fiber.

560
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,263
Cell's working.

561
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,764
For now.

562
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:11,107
Get all these barriers up. All of them up.
No one gets in or out of any of these streets.

563
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:12,900
Where am I supposed to move it?

564
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,360
Back it up.

565
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,159
All right, just stay in your vehicle, okay?

566
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,126
How much longer
does the program need?

567
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:32,879
Eight minutes.

568
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,715
Time to go mobile.

569
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,216
Everybody, up!

570
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,847
You two, move!

571
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,976
Thank you.

572
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,395
Steady.

573
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,488
Steady.

574
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,456
I've got something.

575
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:12,084
Hold your fire, they've got hostages.

576
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,502
Hold your fire!

577
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,972
Go, go!

578
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,359
Please! Just let me go!

579
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,320
Hey, please! Hey!

580
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:43,741
Shoot the tires.

581
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,368
There's no shot.

582
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,914
Now back off.
Back off, they've got hostages.

583
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,833
<i>P.D. are pursuing
the four suspects through downtown...</i>

584
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,044
<i>...in response to a hostage situation.</i>

585
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,219
What's going on with the lights?

586
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,602
It can't be.

587
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,145
What the hell was that?

588
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,148
Oh, boy, you are in
for a show tonight, son.

589
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,656
Please! Help, help, help!

590
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,550
Sorry.

591
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,470
Put that thing away
before you hurt yourself. Get in!

592
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,765
Let's go. You, get in the car.
They've spotted the Batman.

593
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,196
Call everyone in.
Every car patrol, beat cop, off-duty too.

594
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,074
Pull them in now. I'm gonna do
what Jim Gordon never could.

595
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,453
- What's that?
- I'm gonna take down the Batman.

596
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,664
<i>are confirming
four suspects are carrying two hostages...</i>

597
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,875
<i>...kidnapped from
the Gotham Stock Exchange.</i>

598
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:19,337
<i>Reports from the eyewitnesses--
MAN 2“. Scott, dead center of your screen.</i>

599
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,922
<i>- What do you see?
- I see Batman.</i>

600
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,759
<i>Hard to believe, but the suspects
are now being pursued...</i>

601
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,886
<i>...by what appears to be the Batman.</i>

602
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,137
Well, what do you know?

603
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,269
Sir, what about the armed robbers?

604
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,649
Please! Just let me go! Please!

605
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:53,788
<i>One bike's pulled off.
No hostage. Should we pursue?</i>

606
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,877
Negative. Stay on the Batman.

607
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,590
- He's getting away.
- Who do you wanna catch?

608
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,301
Some robber, or the son of a bitch
who killed Harvey Dent?

609
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:14,016
<i>the entire upper west hill...</i>

610
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:16,227
<i>...Central Heights
and East Park Side areas.</i>

611
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:19,313
Eight years, and he has to pick tonight.

612
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,732
He's drawing the cops off Bane.

613
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,535
Please! Just let me go!

614
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,078
Please!

615
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,741
We <i>lost him.</i>

616
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,659
How could you lose him?

617
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,411
<i>He's got a lot of firepower.</i>

618
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:58,662
What, and you don't?

619
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,211
<i>He's heading back downtown.</i>

620
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,421
Then he's as dumb as he dresses.

621
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,632
Close it off, gentlemen.

622
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,458
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen.

623
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,758
You might have
the wrong animal there, sir.

624
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,312
You sure it was him?

625
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,573
<i>Bane says the Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished.</i>

626
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,366
What about the men they arrested?

627
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:21,620
He said, and I quote,
"They would die before talking."

628
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,124
Where does he find these guys?

629
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,460
Open the champagne.

630
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,007
And can we get some girls in here?

631
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,592
Careful what you wish for.

632
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,937
Cat got your tongue?

633
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,314
You dumb bitch.

634
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,566
Nobody ever accused me
of being dumb.

635
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:53,652
You're dumb for coming here tonight.

636
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,739
I want what you owe me.

637
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,492
Want doesn't get.

638
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:05,039
Nice outfit.
Those heels make it tough to walk?

639
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,415
- I don't know.
- Aah!

640
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,417
Do they?

641
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,337
- So where is it?
- Where's what?

642
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,881
The program. The "clean slate."

643
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,343
The ultimate tool for a master thief
with a record.

644
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,637
Hold it right there!

645
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,193
Where is it?

646
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,320
The clean slate?

647
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:39,114
Where you type in someone's name,
date of birth...

648
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:43,452
...in a few minutes they're gone
from every database on earth?

649
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,789
- Sound a little too good to be true?
- You're lying!

650
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,541
Rykin Data took it to prototype stage.

651
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,669
That's why I bought them.

652
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,463
But they had nothing.

653
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,590
It was a gangland myth.

654
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,103
Stay back!

655
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,108
I'm not bluffing!

656
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,402
They know.

657
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,237
They just don't care.

658
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,880
You've gotta be kidding me.

659
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,591
- No guns. No killing.
- Where's the fun in that?

660
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,530
My mother warned me about
getting into care with strange men.

661
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:02,740
This isn't a car.

662
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,458
See you around.

663
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,585
You're welcome.

664
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,337
I had it under control.

665
00:54:58,504 --> 00:54:59,838
Those weren't street thugs.

666
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,090
They were trained killers.

667
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,926
I saved your life.

668
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:08,889
In return, I need to know What you did
with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.

669
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,600
Wayne wasn't kidding about
a powerful friend.

670
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,645
I sold his prints to Daggett...

671
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,066
...for something that doesn't even exist.

672
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:23,070
- I doubt many people get the better of you.
- Hey, when a girl's desperate...

673
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,572
- What's he gonna do with them?
- I don't know...

674
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,117
...but Daggett seemed pretty interested
in that mess at the stock market.

675
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,833
Miss Kyle?

676
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,963
So that's what that feels like.

677
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:04,820
I see from the television coverage that you
got your taste for wanton destruction back.

678
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:06,947
I retrieved this.

679
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,575
Aren't the police supposed
to be investigating, then?

680
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:13,161
- They don't have the tools to analyze it.
- They would if you gave them to them.

681
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,831
One man's tool is another man's weapon.

682
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:19,334
In your mind, perhaps. But there aren't
many things you can't turn into a weapon.

683
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,628
Alfred, enough.
The police weren't getting it done.

684
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:25,173
Perhaps they might have if you
hadn't made a sideshow of yourself.

685
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:29,136
- You thought I didn't have it in me.
- You led a bloated police force on a chase...

686
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:31,889
...with a load of fancy new toys from Fox.

687
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,892
What about when you come up
against him? What then?

688
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:39,855
- I'll fight harder. I always have.
- Look. His speed, his ferocity, his training.

689
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,691
I see the power of belief.

690
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,777
I see the League of Shadows resurgent.

691
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,404
You said he was excommunicated.

692
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,448
By Ra's Al Ghul.

693
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,575
Who leads them now?

694
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,328
Ra's Al Ghul was the League of Shadows
and I beat him.

695
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,247
Bane is a mercenary.
We need to find out what he's up to.

696
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:01,001
Trades of some kind. Coded.

697
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,630
And my fingerprint, courtesy of Selina Kyle.

698
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,881
Get this to Fox.

699
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:10,385
He can crack the code and tell us
what trades they were executing.

700
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:17,726
I'll get this to Mr. Fox, but no more.

701
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,940
I've sewn you up, I've set your bones,
but I won't bury you.

702
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,485
I've buried enough members
of the Wayne family.

703
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:32,616
- You'll leave me?
- You see only one end to your journey.

704
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:37,663
Leaving is all I have
to make you understand.

705
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:41,458
You're not Batman anymore.
You have to find another way.

706
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:45,587
You used to talk about finishing,
about a life beyond that awful cave.

707
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:49,466
Alfred, Rachel died knowing that
we had decided to be together.

708
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:53,512
That was my life beyond the cave.
I can't just move on.

709
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,807
She-- She didn't. She couldn't.

710
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,017
What if she had?

711
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,644
She-- I can't change that.

712
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,814
What if before she died
she wrote a letter...

713
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:07,442
...saying she chose
Harvey Dent over you?

714
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,156
And what if...

715
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,076
...to spare you pain...

716
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,788
...I burnt that letter?

717
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:24,835
How dare you use Rachel to try to stop me?

718
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:28,463
I am using the truth, Master Wayne.

719
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:34,011
Maybe it's time we all stopped trying
to outsmart the truth and let it have its day.

720
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,764
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

721
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,642
You expect to destroy my world...

722
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,397
...and then think that
we're gonna shake hands?

723
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,232
No, no, no.

724
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,569
I know what this means.

725
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:51,820
What does it mean?

726
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,406
It means your hatred.

727
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:58,326
And it also means losing someone
that I have cared for...

728
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:02,914
...since I first heard his cries echo...

729
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:05,667
...through this house.

730
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:10,255
But it might also mean saving your life.

731
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,967
And that is more important.

732
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,223
Good bye, Alfred.

733
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,203
Alfred?

734
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,002
- Answering your own door?
- Yeah.

735
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,713
Page three.

736
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:56,259
Seems you made a series of large
put options on the futures exchange...

737
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,719
...verified by thumbprint.

738
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,555
Those options expired
at midnight last night.

739
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:05,769
Long-term, we may be able to prove fraud.
But for now, you're completely broke...

740
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:09,356
...and Wayne Enterprises is about to fall
into the hands of John Daggett.

741
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:13,360
The weapons. We can't let Daggett
get his hands on Applied Sciences.

742
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,488
Applied Sciences is all locked up
and off the books.

743
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:19,866
The energy project, however,
is a different story.

744
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,535
Miranda Tate.

745
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:25,831
Let's convince the board to get behind her.
Let's show her the reactor.

746
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:29,501
We're meeting her there in 35 minutes,
so you better get dressed.

747
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:33,380
You brought me out here
to Show me this, Mr. Fox?

748
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,549
Bear with me, Miss Tate.

749
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:42,722
Please keep hands and feet inside
the car at all times.

750
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,105
This is it, isn't it?

751
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:53,275
The reactor is beneath the river...

752
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:57,571
...so it can be instantly flooded
in the event of a security breach.

753
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,199
Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?

754
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,660
I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one.

755
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,461
I thought you might like to see
what your investment built.

756
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,297
No fossil fuels.

757
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:18,049
Free clean energy for an entire city.

758
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,761
<i>Three years</i> ago,
<i>a Russian scientist published a paper...</i>

759
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,222
<i>...on weaponized fusion reactions.</i>

760
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:29,311
One week later, your reactor
started developing problems.

761
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,189
I think this machine works.

762
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:38,987
Miranda, if it were operational,
the danger to Gotham would be too great.

763
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:42,240
Would it make you feel better to know
that the Russian scientist...

764
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,202
...died in a plane crash six months ago?

765
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,872
Someone will work out what Dr. Pavel did.

766
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:55,212
Someone will figure out a way to make
this power source into a nuclear weapon.

767
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:00,926
I need you to take control
of Wayne Enterprises...

768
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,636
...and this reactor.

769
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,179
To do what with it?

770
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:05,847
Nothing.

771
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,558
Until we can guarantee its safety.

772
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,935
And if we can't?

773
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,770
Decommission it. Flood it.

774
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:15,732
Destroy the world's best chance
for a sustainable future?

775
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,525
If the world's not ready, yes.

776
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:21,988
Bruce, if you want to save the world,
you have to start trusting it.

777
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:23,740
I'm trusting you.

778
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:25,867
Doesn't count. You have no choice.

779
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,954
I could have flooded this chamber
at any time.

780
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,164
I'm choosing to trust you.

781
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,250
Please.

782
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:44,594
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
This meeting will now come to order.

783
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,931
I'd like to point out that we have
a non-board member here...

784
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:51,434
...which is highly irregular,
even if his family name is above the door.

785
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,853
Bruce Wayne's family built this company.

786
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,772
And he himself has run it.

787
01:02:55,939 --> 01:03:00,694
Into the ground, sir! Does anybody disagree?
Check the share price this morning.

788
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:05,115
Crazy gambling on futures has not
only cost Mr. Wayne his seat...

789
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:07,575
...it's cost us all a lot of money.

790
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,577
And he has to go.

791
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,455
I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.

792
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,549
Now, back to business.

793
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:26,469
- Mr. Wayne, over here!
- How's it feel to be one of the people?

794
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:30,682
Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car!
I didn't know what to do, they had paperwork.

795
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:34,144
Looks like you need a ride, huh?

796
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:36,521
Wayne, we'll give you a ride!

797
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:40,984
How the hell did Miranda Tate get
the inside track on the Wayne board?

798
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,320
She been meeting with him?
Sleeping with him?

799
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:46,448
- Not that we know of.
- You don't know much of anything, do you?

800
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,533
- Where's Bane?
- We told him it was urgent.

801
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,328
- Where is that masked--?
- Speak of the devil...

802
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,747
...and he shall appear.

803
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,374
What the hell is going on?

804
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,378
- The plan is proceeding as expected.
- Oh, really?

805
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:03,340
Do I look like I'm running
Wayne Enterprises right now?

806
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:08,178
Your hit on the stock exchange,
it didn't work, my friend.

807
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:13,475
And now you have my construction crews
going around the city at 24 hours a day.

808
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:18,563
How exactly is that supposed to help
my company absorb Wayne's?

809
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:23,526
- Leave us.
- No. You stay here.

810
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,278
I'm in charge.

811
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:28,448
Do you feel in charge?

812
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:35,246
I've paid you a small fortune.

813
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:38,375
And this gives you power over me?

814
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,377
What is this?

815
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:45,507
Your money and infrastructure
have been important...

816
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,008
...till now.

817
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:48,635
What are you?

818
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,637
I'm Gotham's reckoning.

819
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,681
Here to end the borrowed time
you've all been living on.

820
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,853
You're pure evil.

821
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,314
I'm necessary evil.

822
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:03,400
No. No, no, no!

823
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,448
When you started, why the mask?

824
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:13,284
- To protect the people closest to me.
- But you were a loner, right?

825
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:16,579
- You didn't have any family?
- There are always people you care about.

826
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,667
You just don't realize how much
until they're gone.

827
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,962
The idea was to be a symbol.

828
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:27,257
Batman could be anybody.

829
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:29,342
That was the point.

830
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,929
- Well, it was damn good to see him back.
- Not everybody agrees.

831
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:37,350
- They'll figure that out in the end.
- You got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

832
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:41,104
Yeah. I got 500 pages of tunnel records
and a flashlight.

833
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:43,356
I could use some help, actually.

834
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,234
You know what? Drop me in Old Town.

835
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,448
Hey, hey, hey. I don't think so!

836
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,783
- That's the way this works!
- I don't think so!

837
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,202
- That is the way--
- He's not a mark.

838
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:59,038
And he doesn't have a cent
to his name, anyway.

839
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:03,835
Yeah, it's not much.
But it's more than you've got right now.

840
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:06,421
Actually, they're letting me keep the house.

841
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:09,174
The rich don't even go broke
the same as the rest of us, huh?

842
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:13,303
My powerful friend might hope
to change your mind about leaving.

843
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,097
- And how would he do that?
- By giving you what you want.

844
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:18,933
- It doesn't exist.
- He says it does.

845
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,352
He wants to meet tonight.

846
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,562
Why?

847
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:25,648
He needs to find Bane.
Says you'd know how.

848
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,196
- Tell him I'll think about it.
- Okay.

849
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,239
I like your place.

850
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:35,825
Mr. Wayne?

851
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:40,705
I'm sorry they took all your money.

852
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,082
No, you're not.

853
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:47,003
- Can we help you, officer?
- Uh, yeah.

854
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:50,715
John Daggett's body was just found
in a Dumpster about an hour ago.

855
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:52,842
- Thought you might want to know.
—Why?

856
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:57,138
His name's all over these permits I just
pulled to, uh, map the tunnels under Gotham.

857
01:06:57,305 --> 01:07:01,184
That's MTA maintenance, uh,
sewer construction, couple of other things.

858
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,354
Where did you get to
with the tunnel searches?

859
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:07,398
Remind me to tell detail
to keep hotheads out.

860
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:09,734
We've had teams down there.
It's a huge network.

861
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:13,238
Well, get more men. Work a grid.
I want him found.

862
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,740
Yeah, the, uh, masked man. We're on it.

863
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:18,660
Lose the uniform,
you're working for me now.

864
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:21,246
We could use some hotter heads
around here.

865
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:25,542
- Sir, that could also be a coincidence.
- You're a detective now, son.

866
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,836
You're not allowed to believe
in coincidence anymore.

867
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,558
Nobody's answering.

868
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,101
No.

869
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:44,936
I'm on my own now.

870
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,188
Do you have keys?

871
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:49,566
Never needed them.

872
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,991
Hope you didn't like me for my money.

873
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,327
Suffering builds character.

874
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,919
I'll take care of your parents' legacy, Bruce.

875
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,423
Who's this?

876
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,599
Where's Alfred?

877
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:25,768
He left...

878
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,397
...taking everything.

879
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,756
What's that?

880
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,842
My power's been shutoff.

881
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:04,807
You're good at that.

882
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,853
When I was a child,
we had almost nothing.

883
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:13,816
But on the nights when we had a fire,
we felt very rich indeed.

884
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:18,613
I assumed your family was wealthy.

885
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:20,907
Not always.

886
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,451
Not when I was young.

887
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,953
An old mistake.

888
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,956
I've made a few myself.

889
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,834
More than a few.

890
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:35,588
We could leave.

891
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,131
Tonight.

892
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:42,053
Take my plane, go anywhere we wanted.

893
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,640
Someday, perhaps.

894
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,059
Not tonight.

895
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,089
Don't be shy.

896
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:22,677
Wayne says you can get me
the clean slate.

897
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:25,763
- That depends.
- On what?

898
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,557
On what you want it for.

899
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:30,643
I acquired it to keep it out
of the wrong hands.

900
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,187
Still don't trust me, huh?

901
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,357
How can we change that?

902
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:38,317
Start by taking me to Bane.

903
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,947
You asked.

904
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,285
From here,
Bane's men patrol the tunnels.

905
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,079
And they're not your average brawlers.

906
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,081
Neither am I.

907
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:00,965
- He's behind you.
- Who'?

908
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:02,175
Me.

909
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,307
What do you think you're--?

910
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:23,654
Just a little further.

911
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,414
I had to find a way to stop them
trying to kill me.

912
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:36,000
You made a serious mistake.

913
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:41,506
Not as serious as yours, I fear.

914
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:46,219
Bane.

915
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,472
Let's not stand on ceremony here...

916
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,059
...Mr. Wayne.

917
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,447
Peace has cost you your strength.

918
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,449
Victory has defeated you.

919
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:15,850
Theatricality and deception,
powerful agents to the uninitiated.

920
01:13:16,017 --> 01:13:18,811
But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce?

921
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,565
Members of the League of Shadows.

922
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,944
And you betrayed us.

923
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:30,698
<i>"Us"?</i> You were excommunicated...

924
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:33,409
...by a gang of psychopaths.

925
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:40,791
I am the League of Shadows.

926
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,086
And I'm here to fulfill
Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

927
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:59,727
You fight like a younger man.

928
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:02,188
Nothing held back.

929
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:05,566
Admirable, but mistaken.

930
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:13,574
Oh, you think darkness is your ally?

931
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:16,452
But you merely adopted the dark.

932
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,163
I was born in it.

933
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:21,874
Molded by it.

934
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:26,128
I didn't see the light
until I was already a man.

935
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,548
By then, it was nothing to me
but blinding!

936
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:36,514
The shadows betray you
because they belong to me!

937
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:45,106
I will show you where
I have made my home...

938
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:48,609
...whilst preparing to bring justice.

939
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,030
Then I will break you.

940
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:03,666
Your precious armory.

941
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,670
Gratefully accepted. We will need it.

942
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:20,182
Ah, yes. I was wondering
what would break first.

943
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,731
Your spirit...

944
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:32,862
."or your body.

945
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:19,992
Get me Commissioner Gordon. I got a line
on the congressman's kidnapping.

946
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:34,256
- Excuse me, miss.
- Uh, yes?

947
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:37,593
I'm gonna need to see your ticket
and identification, please.

948
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,804
Oh. Do you mind?

949
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,736
I showed your picture to
the congressman. Guess what.

950
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,572
Don't tell me. Still in love?

951
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:01,283
Oh, head over heels.
Pressing charges, though.

952
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:05,204
You've made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle.

953
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:09,333
- Girl's gotta eat.
- And you have an appetite.

954
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:11,919
Why would you run?
You can't hide with a record like this.

955
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,130
Maybe it's not you I'm running from.

956
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,173
Who then? Bane?

957
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,800
What do you know about him?

958
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:22,304
That you should be as afraid of him
as I am.

959
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,348
We can offer you protection.

960
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:28,686
Okay.

961
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:36,861
When I spotted you, I was looking
for a friend of mine. Bruce Wayne.

962
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:41,240
Did they kill him?

963
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,618
I'm not sure.

964
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,056
Why didn't you just...

965
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:09,226
...kill me?

966
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:12,855
You don't fear death, you welcome it.

967
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:16,150
Your punishment must be more severe.

968
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,485
Torture?

969
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:19,904
Yes.

970
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:22,740
But not of your body.

971
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,870
Of your soul.

972
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,456
Where am I?

973
01:18:30,998 --> 01:18:32,041
Home.

974
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,920
Where I learned the truth about despair.

975
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:38,255
As will you.

976
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:42,468
There is a reason why this prison
is the worst hell on earth:

977
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,637
Hope.

978
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,932
Every man who has rotted here
over the centuries...

979
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:51,518
...has looked up to the light
and imagined climbing to freedom.

980
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:53,938
So easy.

981
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,106
So simple.

982
01:18:57,066 --> 01:19:02,655
And like shipwrecked men turning
to seawater from uncontrollable thirst...

983
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,700
...many have died trying.

984
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:11,288
I learned here there can be
no true despair without hope.

985
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,834
So as I terrorize Gotham...

986
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:19,964
...I will feed its people hope
to poison their souls.

987
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:22,925
I will let them believe
that they can survive...

988
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:29,056
...so that you can watch them clambering
over each other to stay in the sun.

989
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:35,020
You can watch me torture an entire city.

990
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:39,316
And then when you have truly understood
the depth of your failure...

991
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,569
...we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

992
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,158
We will destroy Gotham.

993
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,912
And then, when it is done...

994
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:53,998
...and Gotham is...

995
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,209
."ashes".

996
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,634
...then you have my permission to die.

997
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,442
You're looking her up in here?

998
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:25,446
The Dent Act allows non-segregation
based on extraordinary need.

999
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:28,699
First time she broke out
of women's correctional, she was 16.

1000
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,034
Little closer, baby.

1001
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,286
Why, honey? You wanna hold my hand?

1002
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,372
She's gonna be fine.

1003
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:39,418
I still don't see the need of a
board meeting for the energy project.

1004
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:41,170
Bruce got a lot of things right.

1005
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:43,839
Keeping the board in the dark
was not one of them.

1006
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:47,885
How good of you to join us.

1007
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:51,221
Chair. President.

1008
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:55,059
All I need now is one more
ordinary board member.

1009
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:58,645
Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate?

1010
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,064
No.

1011
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,732
I will volunteer.

1012
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,817
Where are you taking us?

1013
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:17,289
You were right, commissioner.
Will you excuse us, please?

1014
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:18,665
What happened?

1015
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,959
Your masked man kidnapped
the Wayne Enterprises board.

1016
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:24,046
He let most of them go,
but he took three into the sewers.

1017
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:26,548
No more patrols. No more hide and seek.

1018
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,426
Get every available cop down there
and smoke him out!

1019
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,136
The mayor won't want panic.

1020
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,472
So it's a training exercise.

1021
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,310
I'm sorry I didn't take you seriously.

1022
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,145
Not you.

1023
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,689
You're telling me the Batman's gone...

1024
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:47,569
...so you chase up the Daggett leads
any way you can.

1025
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,946
Yes, sir.

1026
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:04,837
He asks how much you would pay us
to let you die.

1027
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:07,005
I told him. I told him you have nothing.

1028
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,007
Do it for the pleasure.

1029
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:12,469
They pay me more than that
to keep you alive.

1030
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:22,104
He will try the climb.

1031
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:39,037
Has anyone ever made it?

1032
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,415
Of course not.

1033
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:54,303
He says there is one who did.

1034
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,805
A Child.

1035
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:00,100
<i>A child born in this hell.</i>

1036
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,603
Bane.

1037
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,898
An old legend. Nothing more.

1038
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:10,861
Don't.

1039
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:15,407
Whatever it is they want you to see,
it's happening soon.

1040
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:42,809
Fire in the hole!

1041
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:13,048
Turn it on.

1042
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:21,598
I only need one other board member.
There are eight others waiting.

1043
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,225
I won't do it.

1044
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:24,768
All right, stop.

1045
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,231
Lucius, you'll kill this man,
and yourself...

1046
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,191
...and you'll barely slow them down.

1047
01:24:57,801 --> 01:25:00,012
Go on, then. Do your work.

1048
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:05,142
Take them up to the surface.

1049
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:07,185
People of their status...

1050
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:12,608
...deserve to experience
the next era of western civilization.

1051
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:20,741
<i>I've been to half of Daggett's cement
plants and locations they poured underground.</i>

1052
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:23,285
<i>Anything strange about the pourings?</i>

1053
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:27,247
Honestly, commissioner, I don't know
anything about civil engineering.

1054
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:30,334
But you know about patterns.
Keep looking.

1055
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:36,882
<i>It's done.</i>

1056
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:41,386
This is now a 4-megaton nuclear bomb.

1057
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:45,390
Pull the core out of the reactor.

1058
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:48,810
No, you cannot.

1059
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:52,814
This is the only power source
capable of sustaining it.

1060
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:57,069
If you move it,
the core will decay in a matter of months.

1061
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:59,404
Five, by my calculations.

1062
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:01,239
And then it will go off!

1063
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:06,995
And for the sake of your children,
Dr. Pavel...

1064
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,414
...indeed I hope it does.

1065
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:12,751
Hey. Hey!

1066
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:17,839
That was you in front
of the stock exchange, wasn't it?

1067
01:26:18,465 --> 01:26:20,133
- When?
- When?

1068
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:24,596
When cops were trying to pull onto Castle
Street and your truck was shutting them out.

1069
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:28,308
- Oh, yeah. You're the cop.
- Detective now.

1070
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:32,479
And, uh, as a detective, we're not
allowed to believe in coincidence.

1071
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:45,242
What were you doing here?
What are you working on?

1072
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,292
Commissioner, it's Blake.

1073
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:59,005
I got two dead witnesses
and a lot of questions. Call me whenev--

1074
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:02,759
Wait a minute. I'm looking at
four barrels of polyisobutylene.

1075
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:06,805
That looks like motor oil right next to it.

1076
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:10,183
Jesus, they're not making cement.
They're making explosives.

1077
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,652
- Patch <i>me in to</i> Foley.
<i>- Foley's overseeing the operation.</i>

1078
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:22,154
They're heading into a trap!

1079
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:26,032
<i>We 're seeing thousands of police
heading into the sewers.</i>

1080
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:29,661
- Mr. Mayor? Literally thousands.
- It's a training exercise, that's all.

1081
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:33,874
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got tickets
to watch our boys thrash Rapid City.

1082
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,794
<i>- Foley.</i>
<i>- It's a trap! Pull everyone out!</i>

1083
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:39,504
Bane has been pouring concrete...

1084
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,631
- ...laced with explosives!
- Where?

1085
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:51,391
<i>Oh, say, can you see
By the dawn's early light</i>

1086
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:57,939
<i>What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's...</i>

1087
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:02,027
<i>There's a ring around the tunnels!
They'll blow it and trap the cops underground!</i>

1088
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:05,947
Pull them out. Pull them out now!

1089
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:10,202
<i>Through the perilous fight</i>

1090
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:14,498
<i>O'er the ramparts we watched</i>

1091
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:19,085
<i>Were so gallantly streaming</i>

1092
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:23,298
<i>And the rockets' red glare</i>

1093
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:27,719
<i>The bombs bursting in air</i>

1094
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:29,971
<i>Gave proof through--</i>

1095
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:32,349
That's a lovely, lovely voice.

1096
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:36,645
<i>--That our flag was still there</i>

1097
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:46,279
<i>Oh, say does that star-Spangled banner
Yet wave</i>

1098
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:52,702
<i>O'er the land of the free</i>

1099
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:59,709
<i>And the home of the brave</i>

1100
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:14,933
Let the games begin.

1101
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:33,303
Everybody okay?

1102
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:35,972
- Let's move! Move, move!
- Go, go!

1103
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:51,488
Gotham...

1104
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,450
...take control.

1105
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,621
Take control of your city.

1106
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:06,711
- Foley.
- Jesus, Blake.

1107
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:08,797
Every cop in the city's in those tunnels.

1108
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,257
Not every cop.

1109
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:28,400
Sir, are you okay? I'm a police officer.
I need your car right now.

1110
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,536
Clear the corners, rookie.

1111
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:23,913
Get my coat, son.

1112
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,832
This...

1113
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:29,794
This is the instrument of your liberation.

1114
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:35,300
Satellite shows a radiation spike.

1115
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:38,428
Whatever it is, it's nuclear.

1116
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:46,144
Identify yourself to the world.

1117
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:51,900
Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist.

1118
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:54,611
Pavel was confirmed dead.

1119
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:58,323
Plane crash on an agency pull
out of Uzbekistan, but...

1120
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:00,450
It looks like it's him.

1121
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:03,995
And what...'? What is this?

1122
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:08,041
It's a fully primed neutron bomb...

1123
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:10,585
...with a blast radius of six miles.

1124
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:14,798
And who is capable of disarming
such a device?

1125
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:18,176
Only me.

1126
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:20,553
Only you.

1127
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:23,848
Thank you, good doctor!

1128
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:29,729
Now, this bomb is armed!

1129
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:32,482
And this bomb is mobile!

1130
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:37,195
And the identity of the trigger man
is a mystery.

1131
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:42,575
For one of you holds the detonator!

1132
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:46,121
Now, we come here
not as conquerors...

1133
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:51,876
...but as liberators, to return control
of this city to the people.

1134
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:57,799
And at the first sign of interference
from the outside world...

1135
01:33:58,508 --> 01:34:02,303
...or from those people
attempting to flee...

1136
01:34:04,222 --> 01:34:06,850
...this anonymous Gothamite...

1137
01:34:07,016 --> 01:34:11,896
...this unsung hero, will trigger the bomb.

1138
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:16,693
<i>For now, martial law is in effect.</i>

1139
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:22,198
Return to your homes,
hold your families close...

1140
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:24,909
...and wait.

1141
01:34:26,035 --> 01:34:29,080
Tomorrow, you claim
what is rightfully yours.

1142
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:37,005
Pull back the fighters.

1143
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:40,425
Start high-level reconnaissance flights.

1144
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:43,178
Get the president on the line.

1145
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:08,328
Tanks and planes
cannot stop us from detonating our device.

1146
01:35:08,786 --> 01:35:14,083
Send an emissary to discuss terms of access
for supplies and communication.

1147
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:21,049
How many of you are there, son?

1148
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:26,471
You don't have enough men to stop
12 million people from leaving this island.

1149
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:29,682
No. No, we don't.

1150
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:30,892
But you do.

1151
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:35,897
Now, why the hell would I try
to help you keep your hostages?

1152
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:39,067
If one person crosses this bridge...

1153
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:41,027
...Gotham gets blown to hell.

1154
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:49,744
<i>The people of our greatest city are resilient.</i>

1155
01:35:50,828 --> 01:35:54,374
<i>They have proven this before,
and they will prove it again.</i>

1156
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:59,337
<i>We do not negotiate with terrorists...</i>

1157
01:36:00,213 --> 01:36:02,048
<i>...but we do recognize realities.</i>

1158
01:36:03,132 --> 01:36:05,260
<i>As this situation develops...</i>

1159
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,930
<i>...one thing must be understood
above all others.</i>

1160
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:14,018
<i>People of Gotham,
we have not abandoned you.</i>

1161
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:15,520
What does that mean?

1162
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:18,439
It means we're on our own.

1163
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,650
I have to get in front of a camera.

1164
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:23,361
They will kill you the second
you show your face.

1165
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:27,991
Bane says he's giving Gotham back
to the people. They need to know I could lead.

1166
01:36:28,157 --> 01:36:29,742
Bane's not gonna let that happen.

1167
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:31,452
Then he'll show his true colors.

1168
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:33,246
And you'll be dead.

1169
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:56,978
Behind you stands a symbol of oppression.

1170
01:36:57,603 --> 01:36:59,063
Blackgate Prison...

1171
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:02,817
...where a thousand men have languished...

1172
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:06,487
...under the name of this man:

1173
01:37:06,654 --> 01:37:08,740
Harvey Dent.

1174
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:12,076
Who has been held up to you...

1175
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:16,748
<i>...as the shining example of justice!</i>

1176
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:19,917
We're just gonna keep moving you
till we can get you in front of the camera.

1177
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:24,047
You have been supplied
with a false idol to stop you...

1178
01:37:24,213 --> 01:37:26,632
...tearing down this corrupt city!

1179
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:28,426
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1180
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:32,221
Let me tell you the truth about Harvey Dent.

1181
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:37,226
From the words of Gotham's
police commissioner...

1182
01:37:37,393 --> 01:37:39,771
<i>...James Gordon:</i>

1183
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:43,691
<i>"The Batman didn't murder Harvey Dent.</i>

1184
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:45,777
<i>He saved my boy...</i>

1185
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:50,406
<i>...then took the blame
for Harvey's appalling crimes...</i>

1186
01:37:50,573 --> 01:37:53,201
...so that I could, to my shame...

1187
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:56,996
<i>...build a lie around this...</i>

1188
01:37:57,163 --> 01:37:59,874
...fallen idol.

1189
01:38:02,168 --> 01:38:07,090
<i>I praised the madman
who tried to murder my own child.</i>

1190
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:11,052
Well, I can no longer live with my lie.

1191
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:14,972
It is time to trust the people of Gotham
with the truth...

1192
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:19,227
...and it is time for me to resign."

1193
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:23,523
And do you accept this man's resignation?

1194
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:29,529
And do you accept the resignation
of all of these liars?

1195
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:31,364
Of all the corrupt?

1196
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:37,412
<i>Those men locked up
for eight years in Blackgate...</i>

1197
01:38:37,578 --> 01:38:41,833
...and denied parole under the Dent Act,
it was based on a lie.

1198
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:44,502
Gotham needed a hero.

1199
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:48,881
Well, it needs it now more than ever,
but you betrayed everything you stood for.

1200
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:56,472
There's a point far out there
when the structures fail you...

1201
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:59,517
...when the rules aren't weapons anymore...

1202
01:39:00,226 --> 01:39:03,688
...they're shackles,
letting the bad guy get ahead.

1203
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:08,776
One day, you may face...

1204
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:10,611
...such a moment of crisis.

1205
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:14,073
And in that moment,
I hope you have a friend like I did...

1206
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:19,912
...to plunge their hands into the filth,
so that you can keep yours clean!

1207
01:39:21,456 --> 01:39:24,125
Your hands look plenty filthy to me,
commissioner.

1208
01:39:25,751 --> 01:39:29,255
We take Gotham from the corrupt!

1209
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:32,633
The rich!

1210
01:39:33,551 --> 01:39:35,511
The oppressors of generations...

1211
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:39,849
...who have kept you down
with myths of opportunity.

1212
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:43,060
And we give it back to you...

1213
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:45,897
...the people.

1214
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,900
Gotham is yours!

1215
01:39:49,358 --> 01:39:52,695
None shall interfere. Do as you please.

1216
01:39:54,947 --> 01:39:58,451
But start by storming Blackgate
and freeing the oppressed!

1217
01:39:58,618 --> 01:40:00,328
Open it!

1218
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:11,297
Step forward, those who would serve...

1219
01:40:12,882 --> 01:40:14,634
...for an army will be raised.

1220
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:23,476
The powerful will be ripped
from their decadent nests...

1221
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:33,694
...and cast out into the cold world
that we know and endure!

1222
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:40,368
Courts will be convened.

1223
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:50,336
Spoils will be enjoyed.

1224
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:56,759
Blood will be shed!

1225
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:02,765
The police will survive...

1226
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:07,353
<i>...as they learn to serve true justice.</i>

1227
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:10,982
This great city...

1228
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:14,652
...it will endure.

1229
01:41:17,363 --> 01:41:21,117
<i>Gotham will survive!</i>

1230
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:45,349
He says you must first fix your back.

1231
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,726
How does he know?

1232
01:41:46,892 --> 01:41:48,311
He was the prison doctor.

1233
01:41:48,477 --> 01:41:52,356
He's a morphine addict
who incurred the displeasure...

1234
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:56,444
...of powerful people,
including your masked friend.

1235
01:41:57,361 --> 01:41:58,863
How?

1236
01:42:00,114 --> 01:42:04,410
Many years ago, it was a time of plague.

1237
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:09,081
Some of the other prisoners attacked Bane.

1238
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:14,795
<i>The doctor's fumbling attempts
to repair the damage...</i>

1239
01:42:15,588 --> 01:42:17,214
...left him in perpetual agony.

1240
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:20,551
The mask holds the pain at bay.

1241
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:24,055
Bane was the child you spoke of?

1242
01:42:24,221 --> 01:42:25,514
He was born here?

1243
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:30,936
The legend is that there was a mercenary
who worked for a local warlord.

1244
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:34,023
<i>He fell in love with
the warlord's daughter.</i>

1245
01:42:34,523 --> 01:42:36,108
<i>They were married in secret.</i>

1246
01:42:36,275 --> 01:42:38,277
When the warlord found out...

1247
01:42:38,778 --> 01:42:42,615
...the mercenary was condemned to this pit.

1248
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:45,451
But then he exiled him instead.

1249
01:42:45,618 --> 01:42:49,664
<i>The mercenary understood that it was
the daughter who had secured his release.</i>

1250
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:54,710
<i>But what he could not know
was the true price of his freedom.</i>

1251
01:42:55,753 --> 01:42:57,546
She took his place in the pit.

1252
01:43:00,675 --> 01:43:02,218
And she was with child...

1253
01:43:02,385 --> 01:43:04,303
<i>...the mercenary's child.</i>

1254
01:43:06,889 --> 01:43:10,101
Innocence cannot flower underground.
It has to be stamped out.

1255
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:18,693
One day, the doctor forgot
to lock the cell.

1256
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:27,785
<i>But the child had a friend...</i>

1257
01:43:28,244 --> 01:43:33,708
<i>...a protector who showed the others
that this innocence was their redemption.</i>

1258
01:43:33,874 --> 01:43:35,584
<i>It was to be prized.</i>

1259
01:43:35,751 --> 01:43:37,503
The mother was not so lucky.

1260
01:43:40,673 --> 01:43:44,343
This is Bane's prison now.
He wouldn't want this story told.

1261
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:59,442
There's a vertebra protruding
from your back.

1262
01:43:59,817 --> 01:44:01,902
It has to be put back.

1263
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:09,702
Stay like this until you stand.

1264
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:22,631
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Did you not think I would return, Bruce? Hmm?

1265
01:44:28,304 --> 01:44:29,930
I told you I was immortal.

1266
01:44:32,475 --> 01:44:34,602
I watched-- I watched you die.

1267
01:44:34,769 --> 01:44:37,730
Oh, there are many forms of immortality.

1268
01:44:39,648 --> 01:44:41,108
Once, I had a wife...

1269
01:44:42,651 --> 01:44:44,361
...my great love.

1270
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:49,116
- She was taken from me.
- You were the mercenary.

1271
01:44:53,162 --> 01:44:55,122
Bane is your child.

1272
01:44:56,749 --> 01:44:57,792
Your heir.

1273
01:44:57,958 --> 01:45:00,711
An heir to ensure
the League of Shadows fulfills its duty...

1274
01:45:00,878 --> 01:45:03,506
...to restore balance to civilization.

1275
01:45:03,672 --> 01:45:04,715
No.

1276
01:45:04,882 --> 01:45:08,302
You yourself fought the decadence
of Gotham for years...

1277
01:45:08,469 --> 01:45:10,387
...with all your strength...

1278
01:45:10,763 --> 01:45:14,975
...all your resources,
all your moral authority.

1279
01:45:15,726 --> 01:45:18,729
And the only victory you could
achieve was a lie.

1280
01:45:19,355 --> 01:45:22,233
Now you understand.
Gotham is beyond saving.

1281
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:23,526
No.

1282
01:45:23,692 --> 01:45:25,820
- And must be allowed to die.
- No!

1283
01:45:32,743 --> 01:45:34,745
Yeah, just lift your head.

1284
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:36,580
Oh, that's good.

1285
01:45:42,419 --> 01:45:43,462
No, no!

1286
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:21,166
- What's that?
- This was someone's home.

1287
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:23,252
And now it's everyone's home.

1288
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:28,090
There's a storm coming, remember?
This is what you wanted.

1289
01:46:57,202 --> 01:46:59,997
It's for the bus,
in case there's a chance to evacuate.

1290
01:47:00,164 --> 01:47:01,707
Any news? Is the commissioner--?

1291
01:47:01,874 --> 01:47:05,210
The less you know, Father.
How are the boys doing?

1292
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:08,172
Well, we've had more power on,
so they've got some TV.

1293
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:09,673
It's good to see you.

1294
01:47:10,382 --> 01:47:14,428
Blake, you be careful out there.
They're hunting down cops like dogs.

1295
01:47:20,142 --> 01:47:21,435
Why build yourself?

1296
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:28,734
- I'm not meant to die in here.
- Here, there. What's the difference?

1297
01:48:30,462 --> 01:48:33,799
I told you it could not be done.

1298
01:48:33,966 --> 01:48:35,592
You told me a child did it.

1299
01:48:36,969 --> 01:48:39,263
But no ordinary child.

1300
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:42,224
<i>A child born in hell.</i>

1301
01:48:46,562 --> 01:48:48,022
<i>Forged from suffering.</i>

1302
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:52,443
<i>Hardened by pain.</i>

1303
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:56,613
Not a man from privilege.

1304
01:49:15,674 --> 01:49:17,634
We got boots on the ground, sir.

1305
01:49:18,427 --> 01:49:19,511
Just waiting on intel.

1306
01:49:25,225 --> 01:49:26,268
You have ID?

1307
01:49:26,977 --> 01:49:28,020
Of course not.

1308
01:49:28,187 --> 01:49:30,731
- Well, how can we trust you?
- We don't have any choice.

1309
01:49:31,607 --> 01:49:33,942
Commissioner Gordon.
Captain Jones, Special Forces.

1310
01:49:34,109 --> 01:49:35,652
Captain. Glad to have you here.

1311
01:49:35,819 --> 01:49:38,489
It's our job, sir.
Now, uh, how many of you are there?

1312
01:49:38,655 --> 01:49:41,575
Well, there's dozens.
I'd rather not say exactly.

1313
01:49:41,742 --> 01:49:44,995
But the men trapped underground
number almost 3000.

1314
01:49:45,162 --> 01:49:47,081
<i>- Condition?</i>
<i>- Getting food and water.</i>

1315
01:49:47,247 --> 01:49:49,541
- Can we break them out?
- Yes, sir.

1316
01:49:49,708 --> 01:49:52,044
Take out the mercenaries
south of Ackerman Park.

1317
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:54,922
<i>Blow the rubble, make a hole
big enough for 10 at a time.</i>

1318
01:49:55,089 --> 01:49:58,300
I'm in contact with my partner
Who's down there. They're just waiting.

1319
01:49:58,467 --> 01:50:02,721
- Men who haven't seen daylight in months?
- Officers who haven't seen daylight in months.

1320
01:50:02,888 --> 01:50:05,557
What about the bomb?
Satellite can't pick up radiation hot spots.

1321
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:09,478
<i>They keep it on a truck.
It must have a lead-lined roof.</i>

1322
01:50:09,645 --> 01:50:12,314
<i>-They move it constantly.
JONES“. Good. 80 you know the truck?</i>

1323
01:50:12,481 --> 01:50:15,818
<i>Well, it's one of three.
We've been tracking it.</i>

1324
01:50:16,193 --> 01:50:17,236
Decoy.

1325
01:50:18,779 --> 01:50:22,199
- You don't really think he's coming back?
- Doesn't matter what I think.

1326
01:50:22,366 --> 01:50:26,245
Actually, it does. You should put your faith
in something a little more real.

1327
01:50:26,411 --> 01:50:29,623
<i>- The routes don't vary much.</i>
<i>- Okay. What about the trigger man?</i>

1328
01:50:29,790 --> 01:50:33,836
No leads. It's a bluff. Bane wouldn't give
control of that bomb to someone else.

1329
01:50:34,002 --> 01:50:38,215
We can't take that chance. Until we have
the trigger man, we just track the device.

1330
01:50:38,382 --> 01:50:42,302
And meanwhile, Gotham lives under
a warlord, like some failed state?

1331
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:45,347
Dial it back, officer.
This situation is unprecedented.

1332
01:50:45,514 --> 01:50:50,769
- We can't do anything to risk millions of lives.
- You gonna tell him what's really going on?

1333
01:50:50,936 --> 01:50:54,022
Captain, the situation is more
complicated than you think.

1334
01:50:54,189 --> 01:50:56,400
<i>There's someone you need to meet.</i>

1335
01:50:56,733 --> 01:51:00,612
Came upstairs looking for a vantage point.
Found the people who run the corporation.

1336
01:51:00,779 --> 01:51:01,947
What corporation?

1337
01:51:02,114 --> 01:51:04,491
Wayne Enterprises. You good?

1338
01:51:13,542 --> 01:51:15,711
Mr. Fox, would you like to brief
the captain?

1339
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:18,505
Miss Tate's fully aware of the situation.

1340
01:51:18,672 --> 01:51:23,135
And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises,
I have to take responsibility for it.

1341
01:51:23,302 --> 01:51:25,304
—Why?
- We built it.

1342
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:26,972
You built the bomb?

1343
01:51:27,139 --> 01:51:31,310
It was built as a fusion reactor.
First of its kind.

1344
01:51:31,476 --> 01:51:34,855
Bane turned the core into a bomb
and removed it from the reactor.

1345
01:51:35,022 --> 01:51:38,400
- Here's the important part.
- As the device's fuel cells deteriorate...

1346
01:51:38,567 --> 01:51:40,485
...it becomes increasingly unstable...

1347
01:51:40,652 --> 01:51:42,196
...to the point of detonation.

1348
01:51:42,362 --> 01:51:44,114
This bomb is a time bomb.

1349
01:51:44,281 --> 01:51:48,285
And it will go off in 23 days,
regardless of Bane's revolution...

1350
01:51:48,452 --> 01:51:51,163
...or what we, or the outside world,
choose to do.

1351
01:51:51,330 --> 01:51:53,916
So your plan might not be
as practical as you thought.

1352
01:51:54,458 --> 01:51:58,921
- Could you disarm it?
- I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it.

1353
01:51:59,087 --> 01:52:02,216
- Let's move from this location and call it in.
- Right. Let's go.

1354
01:52:02,382 --> 01:52:05,594
No, no, we'll take it from here.
You stay and look after these folks.

1355
01:52:12,935 --> 01:52:14,186
Someone sold us out.

1356
01:52:15,812 --> 01:52:17,272
Go, go, go!

1357
01:52:38,585 --> 01:52:40,671
I'll die before I talk.

1358
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:43,632
I'm on your schedule, captain.

1359
01:52:50,097 --> 01:52:52,432
There were people living upstairs.

1360
01:52:52,933 --> 01:52:55,060
Round them up for judgment...

1361
01:52:58,897 --> 01:53:03,777
...and hang them where the world can see.

1362
01:53:05,821 --> 01:53:10,617
<i>Police have cordoned off the entire
Central Heights and East Park Side areas...</i>

1363
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:14,871
<i>...as well as Merchant and South Shoreline
Boulevards in an attempt--</i>

1364
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:22,546
He says the leap to freedom
is not about strength.

1365
01:53:23,005 --> 01:53:24,965
My body makes the jump.

1366
01:53:25,465 --> 01:53:29,344
Survival is the spirit. The soul.

1367
01:53:32,264 --> 01:53:35,225
My soul is as ready to escape as my body.

1368
01:53:35,392 --> 01:53:38,395
Fear is why you fail.

1369
01:53:38,687 --> 01:53:40,230
No, I'm not afraid.

1370
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:43,400
I'm angry.

1371
01:54:12,637 --> 01:54:14,097
Bruce.

1372
01:54:15,307 --> 01:54:16,391
Why do we fall?

1373
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:24,316
You do not fear death.

1374
01:54:25,359 --> 01:54:29,905
You think this makes you strong.
It makes you weak.

1375
01:54:30,447 --> 01:54:31,490
Why?

1376
01:54:31,656 --> 01:54:33,909
How can you move faster than possible...

1377
01:54:34,201 --> 01:54:36,661
...fight longer than possible...

1378
01:54:36,953 --> 01:54:40,540
...without the most powerful impulse
of the spirit?

1379
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,418
The fear of death.

1380
01:54:44,127 --> 01:54:46,004
I do fear death.

1381
01:54:47,798 --> 01:54:49,758
I fear dying in here...

1382
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:52,469
...while my city burns.

1383
01:54:53,512 --> 01:54:55,430
There's no one there to save it.

1384
01:54:56,807 --> 01:54:58,308
Then make the climb.

1385
01:55:03,355 --> 01:55:04,689
How?

1386
01:55:06,191 --> 01:55:07,984
AS the child did...

1387
01:55:12,697 --> 01:55:14,366
...without the rope.

1388
01:55:17,035 --> 01:55:19,329
Then fear will find you again.

1389
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:28,588
Ah, supplies for your journey?

1390
01:55:28,755 --> 01:55:30,841
Oh, that's wonderful. That's...

1391
01:55:35,387 --> 01:55:37,013
What does that mean?

1392
01:55:37,556 --> 01:55:38,807
Rise.

1393
01:55:40,142 --> 01:55:41,184
No.

1394
01:55:44,184 --> 01:56:14,184
<b>YAWNTiC Encode 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

1395
01:57:11,149 --> 01:57:13,068
No, there's been a mistake!

1396
01:57:13,235 --> 01:57:15,237
Take me to Bane!

1397
01:57:17,822 --> 01:57:19,491
I want to see Bane!

1398
01:57:22,744 --> 01:57:23,828
Order!

1399
01:57:23,995 --> 01:57:26,748
This is a mistake! Where is Bane?

1400
01:57:26,915 --> 01:57:29,042
There's been no mistake, Mr. Stryver.

1401
01:57:29,417 --> 01:57:31,836
You are Philip Stryver...

1402
01:57:32,003 --> 01:57:35,507
...executive vice president
of Daggett Industries...

1403
01:57:35,674 --> 01:57:39,302
...who for years has been living off
the blood and sweat...

1404
01:57:39,469 --> 01:57:41,680
...of people less powerful than him.

1405
01:57:41,846 --> 01:57:44,933
Call Bane. I am one of you.

1406
01:57:45,183 --> 01:57:48,728
Bane has no authority here.
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

1407
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:51,022
Now, the choice is yours.

1408
01:57:51,189 --> 01:57:53,608
Exile or death!

1409
01:57:58,238 --> 01:57:59,656
Order!

1410
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:01,533
Exi-- Exile.

1411
01:58:02,284 --> 01:58:03,702
Sold.

1412
01:58:03,868 --> 01:58:05,620
To the man in the cold sweat.

1413
01:58:13,003 --> 01:58:14,421
You follow the thick ice.

1414
01:58:14,588 --> 01:58:16,715
You try to swim, you're dead in minutes.

1415
01:58:16,881 --> 01:58:18,466
Has anyone made it?

1416
01:58:31,896 --> 01:58:34,316
<i>Where are they?
It's not like we have a lot of time.</i>

1417
01:58:34,774 --> 01:58:35,900
How long?

1418
01:58:36,067 --> 01:58:37,902
The bomb goes off tomorrow.

1419
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:41,323
- We have about 18 hours to do something.
- To do what?

1420
01:58:41,489 --> 01:58:45,493
To mark the truck. Get a GPS on it so
we can start to figure out how to bring it down.

1421
01:58:52,208 --> 01:58:53,460
That's it?

1422
01:58:55,962 --> 01:58:57,047
Foley.

1423
01:58:58,590 --> 01:59:02,510
- Where's Foley, damn it?
- You shouldn't be out on the streets.

1424
01:59:07,223 --> 01:59:10,143
- Jim, he's not here.
- You let your wife come to the door?

1425
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:13,355
- When the city's under occupation?
- Wait in the kitchen, honey.

1426
01:59:13,521 --> 01:59:16,149
What did you do,
bury your uniform in the backyard?

1427
01:59:16,316 --> 01:59:18,443
You saw what they did
to those Special Forces.

1428
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:20,945
Have you forgotten all the years
we were out on patrol?

1429
01:59:21,112 --> 01:59:24,240
When every gangbanger wanted to plant one
as soon as our backs were turned?

1430
01:59:24,407 --> 01:59:28,536
That was different. These guys run the city.
The government's done a deal with them.

1431
01:59:28,703 --> 01:59:31,247
Bane's got their balls in a vice.
That's not a deal.

1432
01:59:31,414 --> 01:59:34,709
You move on Bane,
the trigger man is gonna hit the button.

1433
01:59:34,876 --> 01:59:38,838
You think he's given control of that bomb
to one of the people?

1434
01:59:39,005 --> 01:59:41,007
You think this is part of some revolution?

1435
01:59:41,174 --> 01:59:44,010
There's one man with his finger
on the button. That's Bane.

1436
01:59:44,177 --> 01:59:47,263
Look, we've all got to keep our heads
down till they can fix this.

1437
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:51,059
- If you still had a family here--
- This only gets fixed from inside...

1438
01:59:51,226 --> 01:59:52,811
...the city!

1439
01:59:53,144 --> 01:59:54,813
Look, Peter.

1440
01:59:55,772 --> 02:00:00,360
I'm not asking you to walk down Grand in your
dress blues, but something has to be done.

1441
02:00:00,527 --> 02:00:02,570
- Sorry, Jim. I gotta--
- Keep your head down?

1442
02:00:02,737 --> 02:00:04,906
What good's that gonna do
when that thing blows?

1443
02:00:05,073 --> 02:00:07,534
You don't know that's gonna happen.

1444
02:00:11,705 --> 02:00:13,998
I hear you're looking for men,
commissioner.

1445
02:00:14,165 --> 02:00:15,417
How about me instead?

1446
02:00:15,583 --> 02:00:18,169
Miss Tate, I, uh, can't ask you to do that.

1447
02:00:19,129 --> 02:00:20,171
Please.

1448
02:00:21,756 --> 02:00:23,925
You little punk! What'd you take?

1449
02:00:24,092 --> 02:00:26,386
Nothing! I didn't take anything!

1450
02:00:26,553 --> 02:00:29,848
You steal from us, you little bastard?

1451
02:00:30,432 --> 02:00:34,436
Now, you boys know you can't come into
my neighborhood without asking politely.

1452
02:00:40,358 --> 02:00:43,611
Never steal anything from someone
you can't outrun, kid.

1453
02:00:50,285 --> 02:00:52,328
You're pretty generous for a thief.

1454
02:01:01,004 --> 02:01:03,757
- I thought they killed you.
- Not yet.

1455
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:07,260
- If you're expecting an apology, I--
- It wouldn't suit you.

1456
02:01:08,678 --> 02:01:09,721
I need your help.

1457
02:01:10,263 --> 02:01:11,723
And why would I help you?

1458
02:01:11,890 --> 02:01:13,892
For this. Clean slate.

1459
02:01:14,058 --> 02:01:16,060
You'd trust me with that?

1460
02:01:16,644 --> 02:01:18,271
After what I did to you?

1461
02:01:18,438 --> 02:01:21,357
I'll admit, I was a little let down.

1462
02:01:22,984 --> 02:01:26,112
But I still think there's more to you.
In fact, I think that for you...

1463
02:01:26,529 --> 02:01:27,864
...this isn't just a tool.

1464
02:01:28,031 --> 02:01:31,242
It's an escape route.
You want to disappear. Start fresh.

1465
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:35,121
- I can't even get off this island.
- I can give you a way off...

1466
02:01:35,288 --> 02:01:36,831
...once you get me to Lucius Fox.

1467
02:01:36,998 --> 02:01:39,793
Find out where they're holding him
and take me in.

1468
02:01:43,546 --> 02:01:44,631
Why do you need Fox?

1469
02:01:44,798 --> 02:01:47,300
- To save the city.
- Who says it needs saving?

1470
02:01:47,467 --> 02:01:49,052
Maybe I like it this way.

1471
02:01:49,219 --> 02:01:50,845
Maybe you do...

1472
02:01:52,222 --> 02:01:54,557
...but tomorrow that bomb's going off.

1473
02:01:57,143 --> 02:01:58,853
Got your powerful friend on the case?

1474
02:01:59,020 --> 02:02:00,355
I'm trying...

1475
02:02:01,189 --> 02:02:02,816
...but I need Fox.

1476
02:02:02,982 --> 02:02:04,734
As it approaches...

1477
02:02:05,527 --> 02:02:06,694
...flip the switch.

1478
02:02:06,861 --> 02:02:10,406
The needle hits 200, you give me the signal,
I'll mark the truck. Okay?

1479
02:02:11,783 --> 02:02:13,409
Heads up, heads up.

1480
02:02:29,509 --> 02:02:31,803
- I got it.
- Mercenaries on your 6.

1481
02:02:31,970 --> 02:02:35,098
Stand still! Keep your hands
where we can see them!

1482
02:02:37,308 --> 02:02:39,352
Commissioner Gordon,
you are under arrest.

1483
02:02:39,519 --> 02:02:41,229
On whose authority?

1484
02:02:41,396 --> 02:02:42,605
The people of Gotham.

1485
02:02:43,606 --> 02:02:48,528
No lawyer? No witnesses?
What sort of due process is this?

1486
02:02:48,695 --> 02:02:51,906
Your guilt has been determined,
this is merely a sentencing hearing.

1487
02:02:52,323 --> 02:02:53,908
Now, what will it be?

1488
02:02:55,118 --> 02:02:57,829
Death or exile?

1489
02:02:57,996 --> 02:03:02,750
Crane, if you think we're going out
onto that ice willingly...

1490
02:03:02,917 --> 02:03:04,502
...you have another thing coming.

1491
02:03:07,005 --> 02:03:08,339
Death, then.

1492
02:03:08,506 --> 02:03:10,717
- Looks that way.
- Very well.

1493
02:03:10,884 --> 02:03:12,385
Death...

1494
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:15,430
...by exile.

1495
02:03:18,016 --> 02:03:19,475
Bring her to me.

1496
02:03:25,982 --> 02:03:30,194
Hey, we're going now.
Blake says they're ready! Get your gear on!

1497
02:03:30,361 --> 02:03:33,406
Hey, you hear me?
We're going now. Let's do it.

1498
02:03:37,535 --> 02:03:39,787
Find this one a spot,
got a big day tomorrow.

1499
02:03:39,954 --> 02:03:43,124
We all do.
It's not every day you bag Bruce Wayne.

1500
02:03:45,376 --> 02:03:46,753
- Bruce.
- You okay?

1501
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:49,297
Picked a hell of a time to go on vacation,
Mr. Wayne.

1502
02:03:49,464 --> 02:03:51,132
How long until that core ignites?

1503
02:03:51,299 --> 02:03:55,136
- That bomb goes off in 12 hours.
- Unless we can reconnect it to the reactor.

1504
02:03:55,887 --> 02:03:59,015
- Can you get Miranda out of here?
- Not tonight. I'm sorry.

1505
02:03:59,807 --> 02:04:02,060
- Do what's necessary.
- Tonight I need you.

1506
02:04:02,226 --> 02:04:04,646
- What for?
- To get me back in the game.

1507
02:04:04,812 --> 02:04:08,983
Sorry to spoil things, boys,
but Bane wants these guys to himself.

1508
02:04:11,319 --> 02:04:14,405
- I won't forget about you, Miranda.
- I know.

1509
02:04:23,706 --> 02:04:25,500
I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.

1510
02:04:25,667 --> 02:04:27,502
He should be so lucky.

1511
02:04:33,257 --> 02:04:36,010
Any move I make on Bane or the bomb...

1512
02:04:36,177 --> 02:04:38,054
...the trigger man sets it off.

1513
02:04:38,221 --> 02:04:41,015
Well, they won't use radio or cell.
Too much interference.

1514
02:04:41,182 --> 02:04:42,850
Infrared doesn't have the range.

1515
02:04:43,017 --> 02:04:45,770
It'll have to be a micro burst. Longwave.

1516
02:04:45,937 --> 02:04:47,730
- Could you block it?
- Yes.

1517
02:04:47,897 --> 02:04:51,526
But I'll need the EMP cannon
guidance mount from the Bat.

1518
02:04:52,694 --> 02:04:54,320
Remember where you parked?

1519
02:05:08,710 --> 02:05:10,169
She fly okay?

1520
02:05:11,212 --> 02:05:13,923
Yeah, even without the autopilot.

1521
02:05:14,090 --> 02:05:17,051
- Thanks.
- Autopilot? That's what you're there for.

1522
02:05:56,799 --> 02:05:59,594
Okay. It's clear. Come on, quick.
One at a time.

1523
02:06:03,514 --> 02:06:04,849
Wait, wait!

1524
02:06:06,184 --> 02:06:07,643
Ross!

1525
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:09,187
Ross?

1526
02:06:09,812 --> 02:06:11,898
- Lock it up.
- No, keep down.

1527
02:06:12,565 --> 02:06:14,150
Get down!

1528
02:06:15,777 --> 02:06:17,028
Who are you?

1529
02:06:46,432 --> 02:06:47,725
Light it up.

1530
02:07:05,701 --> 02:07:08,871
- Dad, check it out.
- Honey, come take a look.

1531
02:07:19,257 --> 02:07:20,967
Impossible.

1532
02:07:21,759 --> 02:07:23,511
Keep her close.

1533
02:07:24,178 --> 02:07:25,847
He'll come for her.

1534
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:27,932
Where's Miranda Tate?

1535
02:07:28,599 --> 02:07:30,059
Bane took her.

1536
02:07:30,268 --> 02:07:33,563
He's holed up at city hall,
surrounded by his army.

1537
02:07:33,855 --> 02:07:36,357
This blocks the remote detonator signal
to the bomb.

1538
02:07:36,524 --> 02:07:40,194
Get it onto it before sunrise.
They might hit the button when it starts.

1539
02:07:41,112 --> 02:07:42,280
When what starts?

1540
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:43,990
War.

1541
02:08:19,859 --> 02:08:20,985
You missed a spot.

1542
02:08:24,572 --> 02:08:29,452
- If you're working alone, wear a mask.
- I'm not afraid to be seen standing up to them.

1543
02:08:29,619 --> 02:08:32,830
The mask is not for you.
It's to protect the people you care about.

1544
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:36,500
Count to five, then throw.

1545
02:08:46,886 --> 02:08:49,555
No offense, but you got
something bigger in that belt?

1546
02:08:59,982 --> 02:09:03,110
- What now?
- All-out assault on Bane.

1547
02:09:03,277 --> 02:09:05,529
But you need to get people
across the bridge.

1548
02:09:05,696 --> 02:09:07,949
—Why?
- In case we fail.

1549
02:09:08,115 --> 02:09:10,826
Lead an exodus.
Save as many lives as you can.

1550
02:09:10,993 --> 02:09:12,286
You don't need me here?

1551
02:09:12,453 --> 02:09:13,996
You've given me an army.

1552
02:09:14,163 --> 02:09:15,331
Now go.

1553
02:09:16,082 --> 02:09:17,166
Hey, thanks.

1554
02:09:17,333 --> 02:09:18,668
Don't thank me yet.

1555
02:09:18,834 --> 02:09:20,878
Well, I might not get a chance later.

1556
02:09:34,725 --> 02:09:36,435
You shouldn't have.

1557
02:09:37,395 --> 02:09:39,563
The midtown tunnel's
blocked by debris...

1558
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:43,109
...but the cannons have enough firepower
to make a path for people.

1559
02:09:43,276 --> 02:09:45,111
Wait until the fighting begins.

1560
02:09:45,278 --> 02:09:47,989
You're gonna wage a war
to save your stuck-up girlfriend?

1561
02:09:48,155 --> 02:09:49,198
To start it, throttle--

1562
02:09:50,992 --> 02:09:54,161
- I got it.
- We have 45 minutes to save this city.

1563
02:09:54,328 --> 02:09:57,081
No, I've got 45 minutes to get clear
of the blast radius.

1564
02:09:57,248 --> 02:10:00,543
- You don't stand a chance against these guys.
- With your help, I might.

1565
02:10:00,710 --> 02:10:03,087
I'll open that tunnel, then I'm gone.

1566
02:10:04,171 --> 02:10:05,756
There's more to you than that.

1567
02:10:09,427 --> 02:10:11,512
Sorry to keep letting you down.

1568
02:10:15,182 --> 02:10:16,726
Come with me.

1569
02:10:18,019 --> 02:10:19,603
Save yourself.

1570
02:10:21,856 --> 02:10:24,567
You don't owe these people any more.

1571
02:10:24,734 --> 02:10:26,861
You've given them everything.

1572
02:10:27,028 --> 02:10:28,487
Not everything.

1573
02:10:28,904 --> 02:10:30,156
Not yet.

1574
02:11:10,196 --> 02:11:11,864
Disperse!

1575
02:11:12,031 --> 02:11:14,241
Disperse or be fired upon!

1576
02:11:15,659 --> 02:11:18,037
There's only one police in this town.

1577
02:11:57,034 --> 02:11:58,702
Open fire.

1578
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:51,630
- Here it comes!
- Get ready!

1579
02:13:21,494 --> 02:13:25,581
So you came back to die with your city.

1580
02:13:25,915 --> 02:13:29,710
No. I came back to stop you.

1581
02:13:40,763 --> 02:13:41,805
Now!

1582
02:13:54,735 --> 02:13:56,362
That's impossible.

1583
02:13:58,239 --> 02:13:59,865
Cut over to Fifth!

1584
02:14:13,921 --> 02:14:15,923
Here you go. Get on the bus. Go ahead.

1585
02:14:16,090 --> 02:14:18,676
You, come with me. You too.

1586
02:14:18,884 --> 02:14:21,929
Hey, you, you, and you,
come here, come here.

1587
02:14:22,096 --> 02:14:23,931
Everyone else get on the bus, okay?

1588
02:14:24,098 --> 02:14:26,767
You guys, you go knock on doors
and spread the word, okay?

1589
02:14:26,934 --> 02:14:30,813
The bomb is gonna go off. Get out by
the South Street tunnel or over the bridge.

1590
02:14:30,980 --> 02:14:33,691
You do two blocks and you get back
to the bus, all right?

1591
02:14:33,857 --> 02:14:35,734
Go, go, go!

1592
02:14:35,901 --> 02:14:37,278
Is he back?

1593
02:14:38,654 --> 02:14:39,989
Keep your eyes open. Go, go.

1594
02:16:02,613 --> 02:16:04,156
Cover the doors!

1595
02:16:07,326 --> 02:16:08,869
Where's your trigger?!

1596
02:16:09,203 --> 02:16:10,829
Where is it?!

1597
02:16:11,747 --> 02:16:14,583
You'd never give it
to an ordinary citizen!

1598
02:16:14,750 --> 02:16:17,378
Where is it? Where's your trigger?

1599
02:16:18,754 --> 02:16:21,465
Where is it?! Where is it?!

1600
02:16:29,264 --> 02:16:31,392
Tell me where the trigger is.

1601
02:16:31,892 --> 02:16:35,479
Then you have my permission to die.

1602
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:49,326
I broke you.

1603
02:16:50,619 --> 02:16:52,496
How have you come back?

1604
02:16:52,663 --> 02:16:57,167
You think you're the only one who could
learn the strength to escape?

1605
02:16:57,334 --> 02:16:58,627
Where's the trigger?

1606
02:16:59,294 --> 02:17:01,630
But I never escaped.

1607
02:17:02,506 --> 02:17:04,049
But the Child.

1608
02:17:05,843 --> 02:17:07,886
The child of Ra's Al Ghul made the climb.

1609
02:17:08,053 --> 02:17:10,431
But he's not the child of Ra's Al Ghul.

1610
02:17:14,351 --> 02:17:15,686
I am.

1611
02:17:16,145 --> 02:17:18,564
And though I'm not ordinary...

1612
02:17:19,898 --> 02:17:21,608
...I am a citizen.

1613
02:17:41,211 --> 02:17:42,379
Miranda?

1614
02:17:45,257 --> 02:17:46,300
Why?

1615
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:48,385
Talia.

1616
02:17:49,219 --> 02:17:52,264
My mother named me Talia,
before she was killed...

1617
02:17:53,098 --> 02:17:56,518
...the way I would have been killed,
if not for my protector...

1618
02:17:56,977 --> 02:17:58,020
."Bane.

1619
02:18:05,986 --> 02:18:07,154
Good bye.

1620
02:18:09,406 --> 02:18:11,533
I climbed out of the pit.

1621
02:18:17,498 --> 02:18:19,291
<i>I found my father...</i>

1622
02:18:22,252 --> 02:18:25,380
...and brought him back
to exact terrible vengeance.

1623
02:18:26,256 --> 02:18:28,008
<i>But by that time...</i>

1624
02:18:29,134 --> 02:18:32,888
...the prisoners and doctor had done
their work to my friend.

1625
02:18:33,055 --> 02:18:34,264
<i>My protector.</i>

1626
02:18:38,268 --> 02:18:39,770
<i>The League took us in.</i>

1627
02:18:40,145 --> 02:18:41,688
Trained us.

1628
02:18:42,064 --> 02:18:44,858
But my father could not accept Bane.

1629
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:47,152
<i>He saw only a monster.</i>

1630
02:18:47,319 --> 02:18:53,200
His very existence was a reminder
of the hell he'd left his wife to die in.

1631
02:18:53,617 --> 02:18:56,745
He excommunicated Bane
from the League of Shadows.

1632
02:18:56,912 --> 02:19:01,458
His only crime was that he loved me.

1633
02:19:03,252 --> 02:19:06,171
I could not forgive my father.

1634
02:19:10,801 --> 02:19:12,469
Until you murdered him.

1635
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:35,784
He was trying to kill millions
of innocent people.

1636
02:19:36,076 --> 02:19:39,705
Innocent is a strong word
to throw around Gotham, Bruce.

1637
02:19:42,332 --> 02:19:45,377
I honor my father by finishing his work.

1638
02:19:57,556 --> 02:20:02,436
Vengeance against the man who killed him
is simply a reward for my patience.

1639
02:20:03,937 --> 02:20:05,022
You see...

1640
02:20:06,565 --> 02:20:07,900
...it's the slow knife...

1641
02:20:08,066 --> 02:20:10,694
...the knife that takes its time.

1642
02:20:14,489 --> 02:20:15,699
The knife...

1643
02:20:16,533 --> 02:20:20,120
...that waits years without forgetting...

1644
02:20:20,412 --> 02:20:23,707
...then slips quietly between the bones.

1645
02:20:24,750 --> 02:20:26,043
That's the knife...

1646
02:20:27,377 --> 02:20:28,712
...that cuts deepest.

1647
02:20:28,879 --> 02:20:30,005
Please.

1648
02:20:37,721 --> 02:20:39,723
Maybe your knife...

1649
02:20:40,724 --> 02:20:42,142
...was too slow.

1650
02:20:42,309 --> 02:20:43,727
The truck is under attack.

1651
02:20:43,894 --> 02:20:47,648
Gordon.
You gave him a way to block my signal.

1652
02:20:47,814 --> 02:20:48,857
No matter.

1653
02:20:51,401 --> 02:20:53,487
He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.

1654
02:20:57,866 --> 02:20:59,368
Come on!

1655
02:20:59,993 --> 02:21:01,411
This way!

1656
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,419
Stay there! What are you doing?

1657
02:21:09,878 --> 02:21:13,215
Blake, MCU!
I'm getting these boys to safety!

1658
02:21:13,382 --> 02:21:14,716
You'll get us all killed!

1659
02:21:14,883 --> 02:21:17,886
If anyone crosses this bridge,
they'll blow the city!

1660
02:21:18,053 --> 02:21:21,431
It's gonna blow anyway!
We need to open this bridge, now!

1661
02:21:21,598 --> 02:21:24,768
Detective, if you take one step forward
we will shoot you!

1662
02:21:24,935 --> 02:21:28,522
If you take two steps forward,
we will blow the bridge!

1663
02:21:30,607 --> 02:21:33,902
Okay, go back by the bus and wait for me,
all right? Go back and wait.

1664
02:21:37,155 --> 02:21:41,118
Prepare a convoy. We must secure
the bomb until it detonates.

1665
02:21:42,452 --> 02:21:46,164
Don't kill him,
I want him to feel the heat.

1666
02:21:46,915 --> 02:21:51,795
Feel the fire of 12 million souls you failed.

1667
02:21:57,718 --> 02:21:59,261
Goodbye, my friend.

1668
02:22:07,352 --> 02:22:08,729
Good bye.

1669
02:22:09,271 --> 02:22:12,774
Keep moving forward!
Flank them at the stairs!

1670
02:22:20,991 --> 02:22:22,743
Shoot them.

1671
02:22:23,410 --> 02:22:24,870
Shoot them all.

1672
02:22:34,087 --> 02:22:37,716
We both know that I have to kill you now.

1673
02:22:40,635 --> 02:22:42,846
You'll just have to imagine the fire.

1674
02:22:50,687 --> 02:22:52,731
About the whole no-guns thing...

1675
02:22:53,690 --> 02:22:56,735
...I'm not sure I feel as strongly
about it as you do.

1676
02:23:10,123 --> 02:23:11,750
Pull up.

1677
02:23:14,461 --> 02:23:15,879
Stay level.

1678
02:23:28,266 --> 02:23:31,561
We have to force that convoy east
to the entrance to the reactor.

1679
02:23:33,396 --> 02:23:36,399
I need you on the ground,
I'll be in the air. Go.

1680
02:23:36,650 --> 02:23:39,903
The situation has changed.
Your orders are out of date.

1681
02:23:40,612 --> 02:23:44,074
I'm a cop, like you,
and I'm walking out there.

1682
02:23:44,908 --> 02:23:46,993
Please do not shoot me!

1683
02:23:48,954 --> 02:23:50,080
Shoot at his feet.

1684
02:24:00,090 --> 02:24:02,425
Nothing like a little air superiority.

1685
02:24:02,592 --> 02:24:04,678
Detective! Please stop!

1686
02:24:05,262 --> 02:24:08,348
Please, detective! Stop!

1687
02:24:08,515 --> 02:24:10,350
Stop walking!

1688
02:24:11,226 --> 02:24:13,937
Blow it! Do it!

1689
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:27,617
You have to get that bomb here.
You've got 10 minutes.

1690
02:24:38,587 --> 02:24:40,881
They're pushing us
to the entrance of the reactor.

1691
02:24:41,047 --> 02:24:43,508
They're gonna try to reconnect the core.

1692
02:24:44,801 --> 02:24:46,344
You idiots!

1693
02:24:46,636 --> 02:24:48,430
You sons of bitches!

1694
02:24:48,597 --> 02:24:50,348
You're killing us!

1695
02:24:50,515 --> 02:24:52,142
Yeah, follow your orders!

1696
02:24:52,517 --> 02:24:54,811
All right, boys. Get in a circle.
Bow your heads.

1697
02:24:57,731 --> 02:24:59,524
It's on my side.

1698
02:25:47,489 --> 02:25:50,617
Hey, Father! Let's get everyone back
on the bus, okay? Go, go, go!

1699
02:25:50,784 --> 02:25:53,954
- Back on the bus!
- There's nowhere to go.

1700
02:25:54,496 --> 02:25:55,538
On the bus!

1701
02:26:52,429 --> 02:26:54,556
You've got to turn the truck east!

1702
02:26:59,477 --> 02:27:01,229
Stay straight!

1703
02:27:32,969 --> 02:27:36,348
Give me a hand!
We can get a cable on it!

1704
02:27:43,104 --> 02:27:45,940
Fox showed me how to override
the reactor.

1705
02:27:49,694 --> 02:27:50,945
Oh, dear.

1706
02:27:54,657 --> 02:27:57,994
Including the emergency flood.

1707
02:28:14,386 --> 02:28:16,304
There's no way...

1708
02:28:17,222 --> 02:28:18,473
...this bomb...

1709
02:28:19,349 --> 02:28:20,892
...will be stopped.

1710
02:28:22,102 --> 02:28:23,228
What are you doing?

1711
02:28:23,395 --> 02:28:25,772
Protection from the blast.
We're gonna be all right!

1712
02:28:25,939 --> 02:28:27,232
It's an atom bomb!

1713
02:28:27,399 --> 02:28:30,068
Think they need to hear that?
Let them die without hope? Come on!

1714
02:28:30,985 --> 02:28:32,654
Prepare yourselves.

1715
02:28:34,364 --> 02:28:36,408
My father's work...

1716
02:28:37,659 --> 02:28:39,327
...is done.

1717
02:28:45,125 --> 02:28:48,044
- What are you doing?
- I can get it out over the bay!

1718
02:28:48,503 --> 02:28:50,713
Set it to fly out over the water, then eject?

1719
02:28:50,880 --> 02:28:52,507
No autopilot.

1720
02:28:54,134 --> 02:28:57,512
You could've gone anywhere, been anything.
But you came back here.

1721
02:28:57,679 --> 02:28:58,805
So did you.

1722
02:28:59,264 --> 02:29:01,307
I guess we're both suckers.

1723
02:29:08,982 --> 02:29:11,818
- I never cared who you were.
- And you were right.

1724
02:29:11,985 --> 02:29:14,571
Shouldn't the people know
the hero who saved them?

1725
02:29:14,737 --> 02:29:15,905
A hero can be anyone.

1726
02:29:16,072 --> 02:29:18,992
Even a man doing something
as simple and reassuring...

1727
02:29:19,159 --> 02:29:23,037
...as putting a coat around a young boy's
shoulders to let him know...

1728
02:29:23,204 --> 02:29:24,998
...the world hadn't ended.

1729
02:29:42,724 --> 02:29:44,184
Bruce Wayne?

1730
02:29:57,280 --> 02:30:00,408
Come on! There you go!
Okay, you too. Come on, Father.

1731
02:30:19,677 --> 02:30:21,554
Hey, heads down! This is it!

1732
02:30:21,888 --> 02:30:24,807
- No.
- No, that's Batman!

1733
02:31:13,022 --> 02:31:14,315
That's detonation!

1734
02:31:21,781 --> 02:31:23,700
It's out over the bay! Clear of the city!

1735
02:31:43,553 --> 02:31:46,389
<i>"I see a beautiful city...</i>

1736
02:31:46,556 --> 02:31:48,683
<i>...and a brilliant people...</i>

1737
02:31:48,933 --> 02:31:50,935
<i>...rising from this abyss.</i>

1738
02:31:52,145 --> 02:31:56,149
<i>I see the lives for which
I lay down my life...</i>

1739
02:31:56,566 --> 02:31:57,775
<i>...peaceful...</i>

1740
02:31:58,526 --> 02:32:01,779
<i>...useful, prosperous and happy.</i>

1741
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:07,869
<i>I see that I hold a sanctuary
in their hearts...</i>

1742
02:32:09,704 --> 02:32:12,874
<i>...and in the hearts
of their descendants...</i>

1743
02:32:13,708 --> 02:32:15,418
<i>...generations hence.</i>

1744
02:32:18,129 --> 02:32:22,342
It is a far, far better thing that I do...

1745
02:32:23,217 --> 02:32:25,178
...than I have ever done.

1746
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:30,725
It is a far, far better rest that I go to...

1747
02:32:33,645 --> 02:32:35,355
...than I have ever known."

1748
02:32:53,706 --> 02:32:55,124
I'm so sorry.

1749
02:32:55,500 --> 02:32:57,210
I failed you.

1750
02:32:59,253 --> 02:33:00,880
You trusted me...

1751
02:33:02,465 --> 02:33:03,591
...and I failed you.

1752
02:33:07,720 --> 02:33:09,514
Can I change your mind...

1753
02:33:11,849 --> 02:33:13,768
...about quitting the force?

1754
02:33:14,686 --> 02:33:18,523
You know what you said about
structures becoming shackles?

1755
02:33:18,898 --> 02:33:22,443
You were right, and I can't take it.
The injustice.

1756
02:33:22,652 --> 02:33:26,948
I mean, no one's ever gonna know
who saved an entire city.

1757
02:33:27,156 --> 02:33:28,241
They know.

1758
02:33:30,159 --> 02:33:31,869
It was the Batman.

1759
02:33:49,929 --> 02:33:53,516
<i>Mr. Wayne's will was not amended
to reflect his more modest estate.</i>

1760
02:33:53,683 --> 02:33:57,520
Nonetheless, there are considerable
assets to dispose of.

1761
02:33:57,687 --> 02:34:01,149
The contents of the house are to be sold
to settle the estate's accounts...

1762
02:34:01,315 --> 02:34:05,653
<i>...and the remainder is left in its entirety
to Alfred J. Pennyworth.</i>

1763
02:34:07,113 --> 02:34:11,993
The house and grounds are left to
the city of Gotham on condition that...

1764
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:15,872
...they never be demolished,
altered or otherwise interfered with...

1765
02:34:16,038 --> 02:34:19,834
...and that they shall be used for
one purpose, and one purpose only:

1766
02:34:21,502 --> 02:34:25,757
The housing and care of the city's
at-risk and orphaned children.

1767
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:30,803
<i>My clerk can help with the smaller
correspondences and instructions.</i>

1768
02:34:30,970 --> 02:34:32,388
<i>Blake, John.</i>

1769
02:34:32,680 --> 02:34:35,933
- Nothing here.
- Uh, try my legal name.

1770
02:34:39,353 --> 02:34:42,148
You should use your full name.
I like that name.

1771
02:34:42,315 --> 02:34:44,192
- Robin.
- Thanks.

1772
02:34:44,358 --> 02:34:46,527
<i>Why worry about
the stabilization software?</i>

1773
02:34:46,694 --> 02:34:48,696
This entire autopilot system's
completely obsolete.

1774
02:34:48,863 --> 02:34:52,658
Please, I just need to know
What I could've done to fix it.

1775
02:34:52,825 --> 02:34:56,954
But, Mr. Fox, it's already been fixed.
Software patch. Six months ago.

1776
02:34:57,121 --> 02:34:58,706
Check the ID on the patch.

1777
02:35:01,793 --> 02:35:03,377
Bruce Wayne.

1778
02:35:04,253 --> 02:35:06,547
- Any news on the missing item?
- Not yet.

1779
02:35:06,714 --> 02:35:08,132
They better leave no stone unturned.

1780
02:35:08,299 --> 02:35:11,719
We can't leave a string of pearls
on the manifest as lost.
