1
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,790
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

2
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,790
<i>We clear on that?</i>

3
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,510
<i>This is a live project,
and you're a go.</i>

4
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,130
<i>You're a go.</i>

5
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,310
<i>Training is over.</i>

6
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,890
<i>Training is over.</i>

7
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,730
I'm okay. It's fine.

8
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,940
It's just a headache.

9
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,240
You're burning up.

10
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,550
It's okay.

11
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,430
Just a headache.

12
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,160
Anything new?

13
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,330
No.

14
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,670
It's just bits and pieces.

15
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,420
I can hear Conklin's voice

16
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,090
and there's that photograph, but--

17
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,300
I just can't stay with it.

18
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,100
But you're sure it's
not just a bad dream?

19
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,430
It happened. It was a mission.

20
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,690
And I was there.

21
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,070
You should write it down.

22
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,910
Now, two years we're
scribbling in that notebook.

23
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,700
- It hasn't been two years.
- It's always bad

24
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,030
and now it's just the same
thing over and over again.

25
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,200
But that's why we write it down.

26
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,710
Because sooner or later, you
remember something good.

27
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,880
I do remember something good.

28
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,460
All the time.

29
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,730
<i>I want one final go around.</i>

30
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,360
<i>All teams listen up.</i>

31
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,400
<i>We are standing by
for final green.</i>

32
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,610
Survey Two, I need to know
when you've got eyes.

33
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,740
<i>This is Survey Two. I have eyes.</i>

34
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,370
Copy that.

35
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,950
Survey One, this is Hub.

36
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,000
<i>Do you have visual contact?</i>

37
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,090
Hub, this is Survey One.
Mobile One is in motion.

38
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,050
Survey Three, that is good.

39
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,680
- Hub.
- <i>Director Marshall from Langley.</i>

40
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,930
- Langley.
- Stand by, please.

41
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,230
Martin?

42
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,770
<i>I'm here. So is Donnie
and Jack Weller.</i>

43
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,780
We understand you're using the
full allocation for this buy.

44
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,070
<i>It's where we came out.</i>

45
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,320
It's a lot of money, Pam.

46
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,160
<i>For a thief, a mole.</i>

47
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,330
If it does nothing more than
narrow the list of suspects,

48
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,160
it's a bargain at
10 times the price.

49
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,790
<i>Hub, this is Survey Two.
Escort is breaking off.</i>

50
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,210
<i>Mobile One is entering
the building.</i>

51
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,500
Gentlemen, I have the
seller on-site and in play.

52
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,630
Quite frankly, there's nothing
much more to discuss.

53
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,010
All right, Pam. Your call.

54
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,140
Go.

55
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,970
- We're on.
- Audio contact only.

56
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,270
Switching to channel one now.

57
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,020
- Copy that.
- It's affirmative.

58
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,420
Hub, Mobile One and seller
have entered the office.

59
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,920
<i>Copy that.</i>

60
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,470
This is everything?

61
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,680
Those were shots.

62
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,690
Survey One, come in.

63
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,850
Survey One, I need to
know what happened.

64
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,020
What do you see?

65
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,270
Do you see any movement?
Do you see any shadows?

66
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,320
- I see nothing.
- <i>What is your visual?</i>

67
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,230
Get some men in there. Get
some men in there right now.

68
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,690
Pull it up, Kurt.

69
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,110
Eye contact. I don't
care if it's visual.

70
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,660
Mobile One, can you copy, please?

71
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,820
Are you there, Mobile One?

72
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,030
Damn it. I'm sorry.

73
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,830
What do you see, Teddy?

74
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,750
Eyes up the whole way.

75
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,180
<i>...Petroleum Association's
annual conference here in Berlin</i>

76
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,690
<i>is Pecos Oil chief executive
officer Yuri Gretkov.</i>

77
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,020
<i>In just six years,
Gretkov has turned Pecos</i>

78
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,270
<i>into an oil empire,
which in turn--</i>

79
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,280
<i>He's become one of the
wealthiest men in Russia,</i>

80
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,950
<i>after consolidating drilling
rights in the Caspian Sea</i>

81
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,540
<i>and gaining control
of one of the--</i>

82
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,470
How much?

83
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,120
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

84
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,830
He is my friend. There's
been a death in the family.

85
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,340
And I wonder if you've seen him.

86
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,220
- Hey.
- Get in.

87
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,550
- What's wrong?
- We're blown.

88
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:29,970
How?

89
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,470
We pushed it. We got lazy.

90
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,190
Idiot!

91
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,780
All right. That's twice now
I've seen the same guy.

92
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,830
I saw him in town. He was
at the telegraph office.

93
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,620
Are you sure? How can you be sure?

94
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,710
It's just wrong. The guy, the car he's
driving, what he's wearing, it's just wrong.

95
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,550
But, Jason, let's stay calm.

96
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,050
- This is real.
- It could be anybody.

97
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,380
This is real.

98
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,340
That's him. That's
him right there.

99
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,970
Get your head down. Silver Hyundai.
Get your head down.

100
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,120
How far is he?

101
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,290
How far?

102
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,960
A hundred meters.

103
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,400
Here, take the wheel.
You're gonna drive.

104
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,610
Switch.

105
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Just head to the bridge.

106
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,050
Turn here. Cut through the field.

107
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,340
Hang on.

108
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,930
All right, you keep
going to the shack.

109
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,480
I'll meet you there in one hour.

110
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,440
I'm gonna bail out on the
other side of this bridge.

111
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,690
It's the only way
he can follow us.

112
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,150
What if it's not who
you think it is?

113
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,320
It's them. It's Treadstone.

114
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,650
Jason, don't do it.

115
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,650
- Look, Marie, I warned them.
- I don't want you to do it.

116
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,740
I told them what would happen
if they didn't leave us alone.

117
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,410
It's never gonna
be over like this.

118
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,490
I don't want--

119
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,160
We don't have a choice.

120
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,660
Yes, you do.

121
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,380
Thank you.

122
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,640
<i>Two of these explosive
charges placed</i>

123
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,470
<i>on the power lines, and
one of them failed.</i>

124
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,510
<i>The fingerprint's from the
one that didn't go off.</i>

125
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,890
<i>And the Germans can't match it?</i>

126
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,230
<i>No. Nobody's got it.</i>

127
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,390
We checked out every
database we could access.

128
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,860
But we're hooked into Langley now.

129
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,860
- Run it.
- Okay.

130
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,240
What the hell's Treadstone?

131
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,040
All right. Get me a flight.
We're going to Langley.

132
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,400
Two men dead.

133
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,450
Three million in cash
gone, no Neski files

134
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,700
and all very public.

135
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,240
This is still a
clandestine agency, no?

136
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,500
I don't view this
event as a failure.

137
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,000
You call it a success?

138
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,370
We have a lead.

139
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,460
A fingerprint left
by the assassin.

140
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,090
It's one of us.

141
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,010
Who is it?

142
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,180
What can you tell me
about Treadstone?

143
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,350
Treadstone?

144
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,060
That's where the trail dead-ends.

145
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,180
If you want an answer, you're
going to have to give me

146
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,480
a level five SCI access.

147
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,980
We have a lead, Marty.

148
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,820
All right.

149
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,110
You've got your clearance.

150
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,660
But you're on a very short leash.

151
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,490
And you'll give a full
report to the group.

152
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,950
I wanna know where
you're going with this.

153
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,660
Sir.

154
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,950
- <i>Ward?</i>
- Yes?

155
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,160
<i>Pamela Landy.</i>

156
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,500
Hey, Pam. What can I do for you?

157
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,880
<i>I was hoping you had
some time for me.</i>

158
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,040
Time for what?

159
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,590
<i>I'm free right now, actually.</i>

160
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,210
That sounds ominous.

161
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,380
Let me check my schedule.

162
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,510
Excuse me, I need to--

163
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,760
Excuse me. Can I help you?

164
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,760
Yeah, I'm here to see Mr. Abbott.

165
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,770
20 minutes? See you.

166
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,990
Operation Treadstone.

167
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,280
Never heard of it.

168
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,410
That's not gonna fly.

169
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,320
With all due respect,
Pam, I think you might

170
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,490
have wandered a little
past your pay grade.

171
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,290
That's a warrant from
Director Marshall

172
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,580
granting me unrestricted access

173
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,500
to all personnel and materials
associated with Treadstone.

174
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,840
So, what are we looking at?

175
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,960
I wanna know about it.

176
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,010
Know about it?

177
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,010
It was a kill squad.
Black-on-black.

178
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,840
We closed it down two years ago.

179
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,350
Nobody wants to know
about Treadstone.

180
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,510
Not around here.

181
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,310
So I think you better
take this back to Marty

182
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,680
and let him know exactly
what you're doing.

183
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,810
He does. I've been
down to the archives.

184
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,810
I have the files, Ward.

185
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,230
Let's talk about Conklin.

186
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,690
What are you after, Pam?

187
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,280
You wanna fry me?

188
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,860
You want my desk. Is that it?

189
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,870
- I wanna know what happened.
- What happened?

190
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,120
Jason Bourne happened.
You got the files.

191
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,700
Then let's cut the crap.

192
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:49,210
<i>Conklin had these guys wound so
tight, they were bound to snap.</i>

193
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,000
<i>Bourne was his number one.</i>

194
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,130
<i>The guy went for a job, screwed
the op, never came back.</i>

195
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,720
<i>Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't
find Bourne, couldn't adjust.</i>

196
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,300
<i>It all went sideways.</i>

197
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,390
So you had Conklin killed?

198
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,640
I mean, if we're cutting the crap.

199
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,060
I've given 30 years and two
marriages to this agency.

200
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,680
I've shoveled shit
on four continents.

201
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,230
I'm due to retire next year.

202
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,650
But if you think
I'm gonna sit here

203
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,360
and let you dangle me with this,

204
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,480
you can go to hell.
And Marshall, too.

205
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,440
It had to be done.

206
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,910
<i>And Bourne? Where is he now?</i>

207
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,120
<i>Dead in a ditch. Drunk
in a bar in Mogadishu.</i>

208
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,990
- <i>Who knows.</i>
- <i>I think I do.</i>

209
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,410
<i>I had a deal going down
in Berlin last week.</i>

210
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,540
<i>And during the buy, both our case
officer and the seller were killed.</i>

211
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,670
They were killed by Jason Bourne.

212
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,300
They're ready for us upstairs.

213
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,800
Seven years ago, $20 million
of CIA funds disappeared

214
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,300
during a wire transfer
through Moscow.

215
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,260
In the investigation that followed

216
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,810
we were contacted by a Russian
politician, Vladimir Neski.

217
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,770
Neski claimed we had a leak and that
we'd been ripped off by one of our own.

218
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,850
And were we?

219
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,020
We never found out.

220
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,480
We were negotiating a meet with Mr.
Neski when he was killed.

221
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,110
- By who?
- His wife.

222
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,070
The case had gone cold until a
month ago when we found a source.

223
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,910
Another Russian in
Berlin who claimed

224
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,080
to have access to the
Neski murder files.

225
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,080
We thought we had another
bite at the apple.

226
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Turns out the assassin was one
of our own, Jason Bourne.

227
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,550
Now I know Treadstone's not a
very popular subject around here,

228
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,720
but we found some interesting
things when we dug a little deeper.

229
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,300
This is Conklin's
personal computer.

230
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,010
His Treadstone files are bloated
with code keys and case files

231
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,180
that he neither needed
nor had clearance for.

232
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,690
Buried in the hard drive,
we found a deleted file

233
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,600
with an account number
to a bank in Zurich.

234
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,860
At the time of his death,

235
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,690
he was sitting on a personal
account in the amount of $760,000.

236
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,280
You know what his budget was?

237
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,700
We were throwing money at him.

238
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,820
Throwing it at him and
asking him to keep it dark.

239
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,490
It was his own account.
He was up to something.

240
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,910
This is supposed to be definitive?

241
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,330
What's definitive is that I
just lost two people in Berlin.

242
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,500
So what's your theory? Conklin's
reaching out from the grave

243
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,130
to protect his good name?
The man is dead.

244
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,290
No one's disputing that, Ward.

245
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,090
For Christ's sake,
Marty, you knew Conklin.

246
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,970
Does this scan? I mean, at all?

247
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,140
Cut to the chase, Pam.

248
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,550
I think that Bourne and Conklin
were in business together,

249
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
that Bourne's still involved

250
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,770
and that whatever information
I was trying to buy in Berlin

251
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,890
was big enough to bring Bourne
out from hiding to kill again.

252
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,600
How's that scan?

253
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,820
Excuse me, sir, but you're
not gonna believe this.

254
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,820
Jason Bourne's passport just
popped up on the grid in Naples.

255
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,620
Okay. Contact Naples. They need
to know who they're dealing with.

256
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,000
Find out what kind of local
assets we have in place there.

257
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,380
No, it's nothing. Some guy's
name came up on the computer.

258
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,890
Yeah. Hey, listen, Tom, I'm
gonna call you back, okay?

259
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,430
All right.

260
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,030
Mr. Bourne, I'm John Nevins.
I'm with the US Consulate.

261
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,070
I just have a few
questions for you.

262
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,300
You're coming out of Tangiers.
Is that correct?

263
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,680
What's the nature of
your visit to Naples?

264
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,830
Look, I don't know what you did,

265
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,910
and I don't know who
you're working for.

266
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,290
But I promise you this,

267
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,050
you're gonna play ball
one way or the other.

268
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,850
This is Nevins.

269
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,890
This is Tom Cronin,
CI Operations Officer

270
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,180
calling from Langley, Virginia.

271
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,810
Do you have a Jason
Bourne in custody?

272
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,100
Yes, I do.

273
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,900
Listen, he's an Agency
priority target.

274
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,530
<i>Detain him and call me back
as soon as he's secure.</i>

275
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,900
I understand.

276
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,490
He's been detained.
Here's the number.

277
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,910
He's being interrogated by a field
officer out of the Consulate.

278
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,680
Hello.

279
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,050
This is Pamela Landy,
CI Supervisor.

280
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,930
<i>Where do we stand?</i>

281
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,930
I think he got away.

282
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,600
Damn it.

283
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,440
Have you locked down the area?

284
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,150
Locked it down? No, no.

285
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:32,490
This is-- This is Italy. They
don't exactly lock down.

286
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,860
How long have you
worked for the Agency?

287
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,200
Me? For four years.

288
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,700
<i>Well, if you ever wanna
make it to five,</i>

289
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,450
<i>you're gonna listen
to me real close.</i>

290
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,370
<i>Jason Bourne is armed and
extremely dangerous.</i>

291
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,410
<i>Last week in Berlin, he
assassinated two men,</i>

292
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,120
<i>one a highly experienced
field officer.</i>

293
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,710
I want you to secure that area.

294
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,130
I want any evidence secured,
and I want it done right now.

295
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,130
- <i>Is that clear?</i>
- Yes, sir-- Ma'am.

296
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,130
I'm getting on a plane
to Berlin in 45 minutes

297
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,760
<i>which means you're gonna
call me back in 30.</i>

298
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,390
And when I ask you where we
stand, I had better be impressed.

299
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,720
- Berlin?
- I already have a team in place there.

300
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,940
I doubt that Bourne's in Naples
ready to start a family.

301
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,940
You have no idea what
you're getting into.

302
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,060
Do you have any idea? From the
minute he left Treadstone,

303
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,820
he's killed and eluded every single
person that you've sent to find him.

304
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,400
So you read a couple of files on Jason
Bourne and that makes you an expert?

305
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,820
This is my case, Ward.

306
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,160
Enough. I want you
both on that plane.

307
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,660
We are, all of us, going to do

308
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,660
what we were either too lazy or
inept to do the last time around.

309
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,620
We're gonna find this son of
a bitch and take him down.

310
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,590
I'm not having Jason Bourne
destroy any more of this agency.

311
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,380
Is that definitive enough for you?

312
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,760
Yes.

313
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,010
<i>Jason Bourne is armed and
extremely dangerous.</i>

314
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,850
<i>Last week in Berlin, he
assassinated two men,</i>

315
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,730
<i>one a highly experienced
field officer.</i>

316
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,180
<i>I want that area--</i>

317
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,810
<i>...he assassinated two men,</i>

318
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,310
<i>one a highly experienced
field officer.</i>

319
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,320
<i>I want that area secured. I want any evidence
secured, and I want it done right now.</i>

320
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,840
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

321
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,220
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

322
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,970
<i>Are we clear on that?</i>

323
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,680
You'd been working at
Treadstone for three years

324
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,010
and your cover at
the time was what?

325
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,010
That I was an American
student in Paris.

326
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,310
And what exactly did your job with
Treadstone in Paris consist of?

327
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,770
I had two responsibilities.

328
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,900
One was to coordinate
logistical operations.

329
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,020
The other was to monitor
the health of the agents.

330
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,770
- Health, meaning what?
- Their mental health.

331
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,150
Because of what they
had been through,

332
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,820
they were prone to a
variety of problems.

333
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,490
What kind of problems?

334
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,990
Depression, anger,
compulsive behaviors.

335
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,620
They had physical symptoms.

336
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,830
Headaches, sensitivity to light.

337
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,330
- Amnesia?
- Before Bourne? No.

338
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,130
The plane's ready.

339
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,420
There's a car waiting for you.

340
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,510
Good luck.

341
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,880
No. You were his local contact.

342
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,550
You were with him the
night Conklin died.

343
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,220
You're coming with us.

344
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:33,160
Langley pulled an image out of Naples.
It's uploading right now.

345
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,910
It's coming in now.

346
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,670
I need clearance.

347
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,000
He's not hiding, that's for sure.

348
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,540
Why Naples? Why now?

349
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,000
- Could be random.
- Zoom in.

350
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,800
- Maybe he's running.
- On his own passport?

351
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,260
What is he actually doing?

352
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,590
He's making his first mistake.

353
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,430
It's not a mistake.

354
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,140
They don't make mistakes.

355
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,270
They don't do random.

356
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,270
There's always an objective.
Always a target.

357
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,140
The objectives and targets
always came from us.

358
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,650
Who's giving them to him now?

359
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,190
Scary version?

360
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,860
He is.

361
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,380
I emptied it.

362
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,210
It felt a little light.

363
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,590
Put it down.

364
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,800
Front.

365
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,850
Sorry. Old habits.

366
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,770
Use your teeth.

367
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,200
Word in the Ether was
you'd lost your memory.

368
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,370
You still should've moved.

369
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,380
What do you want?

370
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,790
Conklin.

371
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,710
He's dead. Shot dead in Paris.

372
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,380
Dead the night you walked out.

373
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,340
So who's running Treadstone now?

374
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,340
Nobody. They shut it down.

375
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,770
It's over. We're the last two.

376
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,900
If it's over, then why
are they still after me?

377
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,020
I don't know.

378
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,570
Ever heard the name Pamela Landy?

379
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,730
I don't know who that is.

380
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,150
Pamela Landy in Berlin.
What's going on in Berlin?

381
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,450
I don't know.

382
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,950
Why would I lie?

383
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,770
I thought you were
here to kill me.

384
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,940
What'd you do?

385
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,400
I'm sorry.

386
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,400
Did you call it in?

387
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,240
Get up. Come on.

388
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,040
You have a car out front?

389
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,620
The keys are in my coat pocket.

390
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,750
But we should--

391
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,210
- What?
- Go out the back. I have another car.

392
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,640
Pamela Landy, please.

393
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,140
<i>One moment, please.</i>

394
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,550
Thank you.

395
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,100
I wanted to call a guest.
Pamela Landy.

396
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,560
Just one second, please.

397
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,560
Hello?

398
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:07,820
<i>Hello?</i>

399
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:11,860
I'm sorry, sir. The
phone's busy right now.

400
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:13,780
I'll just call later. Thank you.

401
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:05,080
<i>Okay. Let's take a look at the timeline.
What's Bourne's objective?</i>

402
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,300
Now, I wanna break
this out in boxes.

403
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,920
Naples outbound. Check everything.

404
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,050
Flights, trains, police reports.

405
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:12,380
That's box one.
Teddy, that's yours.

406
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:13,760
Got it.

407
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,060
<i>Box number two. Call it
"Prior Connections."</i>

408
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,690
I want to rerun all Bourne's
Treadstone material. Every footstep.

409
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,570
<i>Kim, box three. I want to
identify his method of travel.</i>

410
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:28,940
Stay on the local cops.

411
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,900
We need a vehicle, a
parking ticket, something.

412
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:33,400
Langley's offered to upload any
satellite imaging we need.

413
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:35,530
So let's find a target for them.

414
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,370
Danny, box four. I
need fresh eyes.

415
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,700
Review the buy where we
lost the Neski files.

416
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:44,210
Timeline it with what we know
about Bourne's movements.

417
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:47,080
Turn it upside down
and see what we find.

418
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,670
Come on, guys. We ran this guy's life
with total control for all those years.

419
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,470
We should be a step ahead of him.

420
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:56,180
You wanna go home?
Find Jason Bourne.

421
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,780
<i>Pamela Landy.</i>

422
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,580
This is Jason Bourne.

423
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:22,450
- Bourne?
- It's Bourne.

424
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,620
We need 90 seconds to
triangulate his position.

425
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,710
<i>What do you want?</i>

426
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,550
Are you running Treadstone?

427
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:36,590
Treadstone was closed
down two years ago.

428
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,220
<i>You know that.</i>

429
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,640
Then who's planning
the missions now?

430
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,180
There are no missions. It's over.

431
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,980
Then what do you want with me?

432
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,560
Berlin.

433
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:54,110
Have you forgotten what
happened in Berlin?

434
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,070
<i>You killed two people, Bourne.</i>

435
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,710
<i>Vladimir Neski.</i>

436
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,260
Bourne?

437
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,680
<i>I wanna come in.</i>

438
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,770
Okay. How do you wanna do it?

439
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:30,150
We need 35 seconds.

440
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,770
<i>I need someone I
know to bring me in.</i>

441
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,480
Who?

442
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,610
There was a girl in Paris.
She was part of the program.

443
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,700
<i>She used to handle logistics.</i>

444
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,030
Alexanderstrasse, 30 minutes,
under the World Clock.

445
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,620
<i>Send her alone. Give
her your phone.</i>

446
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,210
What if I can't find her?

447
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:51,170
<i>It's easy. She's standing
right next to you.</i>

448
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,100
- There's just so many of them, sir.
- Here it is.

449
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,810
It's the second quadrant.
Kurt, pull it up.

450
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:11,940
Where is it?

451
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,860
Get the second quadrant, please,
and pull it all the way up.

452
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:17,440
The clock is right here. Shit, he's put
her right in the middle of everything.

453
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:18,740
This is a security nightmare.

454
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,780
There is no way we are
going to get her covered.

455
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,570
Call a mayday into Berlin station.

456
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,870
We need snipers, DOD,
whatever they've got.

457
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,160
No snipers. No snipers.

458
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,950
You put snipers on the roof and it'll
scare him off, and I need answers.

459
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,660
You can't really believe
he wants to come in.

460
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,330
He knows something
about the Neski case.

461
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,750
And I'm not gonna pass up this
chance to find out what it is.

462
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,550
Don't be a fool. Not
when we're this close.

463
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:38,920
Are we talking about protecting
Nicky or killing Bourne?

464
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,340
We're talking about
killing Bourne.

465
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,970
We're talking about
the next dead body.

466
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:43,510
It might be Nicky.
It will be someone.

467
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,850
You're not hearing me. Bourne
dead gives me nothing.

468
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,350
Can I talk to you privately?

469
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:00,740
- What?
- I know how you're feeling.

470
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,660
You lost two men in Berlin, and
you want it to mean something.

471
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,950
But nothing Bourne gives you
will bring your men back.

472
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:08,450
Nothing in those files makes
their sacrifice worthwhile.

473
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,040
You have to let go.

474
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,250
We're professionals.

475
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:13,670
When an operation goes
bad, we tie it off.

476
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,920
If there's something you're
not telling me, I want it now

477
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,130
before I send that girl out there.

478
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,670
Do you understand?

479
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:24,890
You talk about this stuff
like you read it in a book.

480
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,190
What do you want to do?

481
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,820
Put the snipers in place.

482
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:47,580
If things go bad, we take him out.

483
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,080
You got it.

484
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,950
Hub, this is Survey One.
We have a crowd moving in.

485
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,500
<i>It's some sort of protest march.</i>

486
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,290
I'm sorry. This is as
close as I can get.

487
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:38,130
Survey Two, can you get
in any closer, please?

488
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:39,960
Kurt, make sure the
south end is covered.

489
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,130
Roger.

490
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,010
Affirmative.

491
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:44,090
Copy that.

492
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:58,900
Hello.

493
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,070
<i>There's a tram coming towards you.
Get on it.</i>

494
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,570
She's moving to the tram.

495
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,280
Where's it going?
Where's it going?

496
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,360
The tram is going to
Alexanderplatz Station.

497
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,570
Alexanderplatz.

498
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,660
<i>Survey Five, I can't see him.
I don't see him.</i>

499
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,300
<i>Hub, this is Survey Two,
she's getting on the tram.</i>

500
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:24,380
She's getting on the tram.

501
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,550
Zoom in on the tram.

502
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,090
Bourne's on the tram.

503
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,720
I don't think he's on the tram.

504
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,590
He's on the tram.

505
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:36,140
Send them in to follow. Tell
them to keep their distance.

506
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:38,270
Okay, Delta, let's go. Get on it.

507
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,020
Come on. Let's go.

508
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,520
Tell them to hurry.

509
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,190
There's nothing on the south side.

510
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,960
Alexanderplatz
Station, 25 seconds.

511
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,730
<i>This is Survey Three. There's
a lot of protesters here.</i>

512
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:23,440
<i>There's no way we can
cover her out there.</i>

513
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:25,480
Get her out of there.

514
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:27,029
Go! Delta, move! Now!

515
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:27,070
Go! Delta, move! Now!

516
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,460
She's not here. She's gone.

517
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:48,670
God damn it!

518
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,800
They are not on the tram.

519
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,880
He's one guy!

520
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:54,180
- <i>Jason, please don't hurt me.</i>
- <i>What were my words?</i>

521
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,350
What did I say?

522
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:57,430
I said leave me alone,
leave me out of it.

523
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,350
<i>I did. I swear. Jason, I told
them that I believed you.</i>

524
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,310
I'm gonna ask you some
simple questions.

525
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,770
You're gonna answer me honestly,

526
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,940
or I swear to God
I'm gonna kill you.

527
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,690
Delta, give me something.
I need something.

528
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,320
They're on it! They're on it!

529
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,200
Who's Pamela Landy?

530
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,910
<i>She's a task force chief.</i>

531
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:15,280
Is she running Treadstone?

532
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:17,200
No, she's the deputy director.

533
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,870
Why is she trying to kill me?

534
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:20,620
<i>Last week an Agency field officer</i>

535
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,410
<i>tried to make a buy off
of one of her ops.</i>

536
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,380
He was trying to sell out
a mole or something.

537
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,460
- And?
- And you got to him before we did.

538
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,250
- I killed him?
- You left a print.

539
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,590
<i>And they were partial prints
that trace back to Treadstone.</i>

540
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:31,880
<i>They know it was you.</i>

541
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:33,880
- <i>That is insane.</i>
- Why are you doing this?

542
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:35,590
Why come back now?
Landy will find--

543
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,930
Just stop.

544
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:42,230
Last week I was 4,000 miles away
in India, watching Marie die.

545
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:45,310
<i>They came for me, and
they killed her instead.</i>

546
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:47,560
<i>This ends now.</i>

547
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,490
Find her.

548
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,030
What do you people want with me?

549
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,280
Why are you trying to frame me?

550
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:01,700
Please! I'm only here because of Paris.
Abbott dragged us--

551
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,040
Abbott? Who's Abbott?

552
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,750
Conklin's boss. He
shut down Treadstone.

553
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:06,580
- Is he here in Berlin?
- Yes.

554
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:08,590
Did he run Treadstone?

555
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,550
Did he run Treadstone?

556
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,090
Yes. Conklin reported to him.

557
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,010
Please. Please, I swear.

558
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:16,640
All right, what was Landy buying?
What kind of files?

559
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,350
Conklin. Stuff on Conklin.

560
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:21,100
It was something to do
with a Russian politician.

561
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,360
Neski.

562
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,360
What? What are you talking about?

563
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,990
<i>Training is over.
Training is over.</i>

564
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:36,610
<i>Training is over.</i>

565
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,030
When was I here in Berlin?

566
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,200
What are you talking about?

567
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,540
For Treadstone. You know my file.
I did a job here.

568
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:43,660
- When?
- No, you never worked in Berlin before.

569
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,040
My first job. In Berlin.

570
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,500
I did a job here.
You know my file.

571
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:47,790
No. You've never
worked Berlin before.

572
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,920
My first job!

573
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,540
No, your first
assignment was Geneva.

574
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:52,420
You fucking people!

575
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,840
I swear! I swear!

576
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,550
I know I was here, Nicky!

577
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:57,630
It's not in your file!
It's not in your file!

578
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,010
I know I was here!

579
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,600
No, I swear. Oh, please!

580
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:22,580
Pam, I want to show you something.
It's in Alexanderplatz.

581
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,540
We got three levels,
we got 15 tunnels.

582
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,500
They're all converging
in a five-block radius.

583
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,660
Over here, Luftschutzbunker.

584
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:28,830
That was an old war shelter.

585
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,960
How many men are out there?

586
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,500
Two coming down the back stairs.

587
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:33,000
The rest are fanned
out for a search.

588
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:34,210
What's our security
situation here?

589
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,380
Where, "here"? The ground?

590
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,510
Here, here. In the building.

591
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:39,510
Check everything, and recheck all the
stairwells, all the hallways, everything.

592
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:40,930
It's done.

593
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,310
Okay, let's go public.

594
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:45,930
Release his photo to
the Berlin police.

595
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,350
And check out his story about
the girlfriend in India, too.

596
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,770
I'm on it.

597
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:52,060
You're in a big puddle
of shit, Pamela,

598
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:54,110
and you don't have
the shoes for it.

599
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,900
He said he didn't know
anything about Berlin.

600
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,690
He knew that Nicky
was wearing a wire.

601
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,450
Don't you think that
was for our benefit?

602
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:01,620
He didn't sound like a
man in control to me.

603
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,530
We know he was in Berlin.

604
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,740
His mind is broken. We broke it.

605
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,200
- And now--
- What now? Terminate him?

606
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:09,210
You've been pushing that
agenda ever since we got here.

607
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:11,580
He also said you were running Treadstone.
Should we believe that, too?

608
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:13,130
I'm convinced that
Bourne knows something.

609
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:15,090
He knows that you're after him

610
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:19,260
and in the interest of self-preservation
you might start with that.

611
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:22,260
Check on those photos.
Have they gone out?

612
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,530
I need to show you something.

613
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:25,840
All right, I finished my box work

614
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:28,180
but I wanted to show you
before I showed Landy.

615
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,520
I came down here last night because
none of this is making any sense.

616
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,350
I mean, I'm with you. Conklin was a nut.
But a traitor?

617
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,850
I just can't get there.

618
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,350
What do you have, Danny?

619
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,020
All right, you put a four-gram Kel on here,
it's gonna take out power to the building.

620
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:42,280
You know that.

621
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,110
There were two charges that were
supposed to go off simultaneously.

622
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,280
The second one,

623
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,660
the one over here, didn't go off.

624
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,530
Now, first of all,
this is nothing.

625
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,370
It's a sub-line for
the breaker above.

626
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:55,160
And second, why put the
charge all the way down here?

627
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,580
If you're good enough to get
in here and handle the gear,

628
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:59,750
you're good enough to
know you don't need this.

629
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,550
Bourne would know.

630
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:02,960
It was staged?

631
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:04,510
Is it a slam-dunk? No.

632
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:07,050
But what if somebody were
trying to cover their tracks

633
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,300
by blaming Conklin and Bourne?

634
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:12,720
What if Bourne didn't have
anything to do with this?

635
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:15,850
Show me again.

636
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:16,980
All right.

637
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,230
Well, you put--

638
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:46,010
<i>Pull over. He's getting out.</i>

639
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:50,680
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

640
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,510
<i>We clear on that?</i>

641
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,680
This is a live project,
and you're a go.

642
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,190
I'll see you on the other side.

643
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,380
Good evening, sir.
How can I help you?

644
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,170
Yeah, hi. I want to get
a room for the night.

645
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,210
- Do you have a reservation?
- No.

646
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:37,140
Actually, is Room 645 available?
I've stayed there before.

647
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:43,520
<i>I'm sorry, sir. That
room is occupied.</i>

648
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:46,730
How about Room 644? It's
right across the hall.

649
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,530
Sir?

650
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,360
644?

651
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:53,160
That's fine. Thank you.

652
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,450
I just need your
passport and signature.

653
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,080
Right here, please.

654
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,460
Have a nice night.

655
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:21,950
Where?

656
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,160
Brecker Hotel.

657
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,250
Okay, we're there. Take the van!

658
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:27,290
- Brecker? How far?
- About five, six minutes.

659
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,080
<i>Congratulations, soldier.</i>

660
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:52,040
Training is over.

661
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,060
Go!

662
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:24,550
Black coat, possibly leather,
dark T-shirt, dark pants.

663
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,140
The cops out there wanna corral all the
guests together out on the sidewalk

664
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,390
and check them out one by one.

665
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,930
That will really work.

666
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:32,440
What the hell's he doing here?

667
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,310
Maybe he just wanted
to stay the night.

668
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,160
- They missed him?
- Yeah, so far.

669
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,950
But they found Nicky.
She's back at the Westin.

670
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,040
Bourne let her go.

671
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,960
- He let her go?
- Yeah.

672
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,620
Where's Danny Zorn?

673
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:26,000
He ought to head over
there and debrief her.

674
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,420
Why did Bourne come here?

675
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,090
We don't know yet.

676
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,760
Landy's upstairs in
one of the rooms.

677
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,930
She said she'd call
you when she's done.

678
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,680
Okay.

679
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:44,270
I think I'll take a cab
back to the hotel.

680
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,990
So the room he checked
into was across the hall.

681
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:56,620
Why would he come in here?

682
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,040
What are you thinking?

683
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:07,960
I recognize this
room from a photo.

684
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:11,300
There was a chalk
outline right here

685
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:13,300
around the body of Vladimir Neski.

686
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,050
This is where his wife killed him?

687
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,810
Do you still think
his wife killed him?

688
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,940
Guess he got out
through this window.

689
01:13:32,650 --> 01:13:35,490
We just got word from
the Berlin police.

690
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:37,910
They found Danny Zorn's body.

691
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:44,290
I want you two to stay on Bourne.

692
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:46,370
Check everything that's out there.

693
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,380
Call Abbott. Tell him to
wait for me in his hotel.

694
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:50,880
I'm coming to see him.

695
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,950
- <i>Da.</i>
- It's me.

696
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:24,660
They're onto Neski.

697
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,580
This is not a clean phone.

698
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:29,290
<i>They can't prove
anything without Bourne.</i>

699
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:32,460
Kill Bourne, and you
kill this investigation.

700
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:36,470
I'm afraid, Ward, the time has
come for us to part company.

701
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:41,140
Listen, Yuri, you bought those oil leases
with $20 million in stolen CIA seed money.

702
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:42,310
You owe me.

703
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:43,390
<i>I gave you your cut.</i>

704
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,310
We both got rich.

705
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:47,690
I don't owe you anything.

706
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:51,810
The plan can still be salvaged.
Just get Bourne. Do you hear me?

707
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,520
He's still out there. Now get him.

708
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:55,110
<i>Get Jason--</i>

709
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:19,970
I don't suppose it'll do me
much good to cry for help, huh?

710
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:21,760
Not much.

711
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,890
You killed her.

712
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,270
It was a mistake.

713
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,520
It was supposed to be you.

714
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:34,400
There were files linking
me to the Neski murder.

715
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,440
If the files disappeared
and they suspected you,

716
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,200
they'd be chasing a
ghost for 10 years.

717
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,120
So we got in the way.

718
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,910
Is that why Neski died?

719
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:46,700
Is that why you killed Marie?

720
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:48,540
You killed Marie,

721
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,210
the minute you climbed
into her car.

722
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:54,040
The minute you entered
her life, she was dead.

723
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:57,380
I told you people to leave us alone.
I fell off the grid.

724
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:58,880
I was halfway around the world.

725
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:01,840
There's no place it
won't catch up to you.

726
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,300
It's how every story ends.

727
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,680
It's what you are,
Jason, a killer.

728
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:10,520
You always will be.

729
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,110
Go ahead. Go on. Go on!
Do it! Do it!

730
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:19,900
She wouldn't want me to.

731
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:22,490
That's the only
reason you're alive.

732
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,730
I'm a patriot. I serve my country.

733
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:44,110
And Danny Zorn? What was he?

734
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,450
Unlucky.

735
01:17:47,070 --> 01:17:48,740
Collateral damage.

736
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:53,830
So what do we do now?

737
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,420
I'm not sorry.

738
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,980
No, no, no, forget it.

739
01:18:58,060 --> 01:18:59,560
Call me as soon as he's here.

740
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:00,860
No, that's nothing.

741
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:02,060
We could synch-up.

742
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:03,400
Who's this guy?

743
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,860
Platform P.

744
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:08,650
<i>Go ahead. Go on. Go on!
Do it! Do it!</i>

745
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:11,410
<i>She wouldn't want me to.</i>

746
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:13,330
<i>That's the only
reason you're alive.</i>

747
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:27,970
Got a call from Langley.

748
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:30,470
They're going through
Abbott's records

749
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:34,010
and Marshall wants to know
what's going on with Bourne.

750
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:38,980
Wait, Teddy. Teddy, who's this?
Look at this guy.

751
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:40,770
He's about to enter. Right there!
There!

752
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,020
Right through there.

753
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,270
That's Bourne.

754
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,150
Get down here! We got something!
We got him!

755
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:46,780
We got a sighting! Check it out!

756
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:49,400
- There. I got it on the big monitor.
- Hold on.

757
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:51,280
There he comes again.

758
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,700
Whoa, whoa. Hold on.
He's just entered frame.

759
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:55,160
It's the coat. That's him!

760
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:56,990
What train is that?

761
01:19:58,410 --> 01:19:59,910
That's the train to Moscow.

762
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,420
Why the hell would
he go to Moscow?

763
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:07,130
Get me the Russian
Interior Ministry.

764
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:33,570
I speak English.

765
01:36:34,030 --> 01:36:35,950
I'm not gonna hurt you.

766
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:40,250
I won't hurt you.

767
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:49,710
You're older.

768
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:56,600
Older than I thought you'd be.

769
01:37:00,850 --> 01:37:02,350
That picture.

770
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:06,980
Does that mean a lot to you?

771
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:12,240
It's nothing. It's just a picture.

772
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:13,570
No.

773
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:18,120
It's because you don't
know how they died.

774
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:20,200
I do.

775
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,580
No, you don't.

776
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:31,550
I would want to know.

777
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:38,560
I would want to know that my--

778
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:40,720
That my mother didn't
kill my father,

779
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:44,520
that she didn't kill herself.

780
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:45,730
What?

781
01:37:48,610 --> 01:37:51,860
It's not what happened
to your parents.

782
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,620
I killed them.

783
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,920
I killed them.

784
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:10,800
It was my job.

785
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,590
It was my first time.

786
01:38:19,970 --> 01:38:22,850
Your father was
supposed to be alone.

787
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,480
But then your mother

788
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:33,990
came out of nowhere

789
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,450
and I had to change my plan.

790
01:38:46,370 --> 01:38:48,170
It changes things,

791
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:50,670
that knowledge.

792
01:38:51,210 --> 01:38:52,630
Doesn't it?

793
01:38:58,590 --> 01:39:01,470
When what you love
gets taken from you,

794
01:39:05,730 --> 01:39:07,730
you wanna know the truth.

795
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:28,460
I'm sorry.

796
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:29,020
Pamela Landy.

797
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:30,890
<i>I hear you're still
looking for me.</i>

798
01:40:35,110 --> 01:40:36,230
Bourne?

799
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:37,440
<i>What do you want?</i>

800
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:43,070
I wanted to thank you

801
01:40:43,870 --> 01:40:45,370
for the tape.

802
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:49,290
<i>We got what we needed.
It's all tied off.</i>

803
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:50,620
<i>It's over.</i>

804
01:40:51,870 --> 01:40:54,130
I guess I owe you an apology.

805
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,630
Is that official?

806
01:40:57,380 --> 01:41:00,630
<i>No. Off the record.
You know how it is.</i>

807
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:02,840
Goodbye.

808
01:41:02,930 --> 01:41:04,300
Wait. Wait.

809
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:11,310
David Webb.

810
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:13,980
That's your real name.

811
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:17,940
<i>You were born 4-15-'71
in Nixa, Missouri.</i>

812
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:23,110
<i>Why don't you come in,
and we'll talk about it?</i>

813
01:41:26,490 --> 01:41:27,700
Bourne?

814
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:33,870
Get some rest, Pam.
You look tired.
