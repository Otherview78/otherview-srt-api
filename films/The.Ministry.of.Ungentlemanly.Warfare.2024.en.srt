1
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:48,408
Uh, Sweden.

2
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:51,579
I'm... I'm... Swedish

3
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,413
but I speak a little English.

4
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,481
We're coming on board.

5
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:04,892
All are welcome.
All are welcome.

6
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:08,228
Even the little one.
He can come too.

7
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,397
Welcome.

8
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,672
Why are you here?

9
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:19,741
Just a little sailing holiday.

10
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:21,075
A jolly boys trip.

11
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:22,142
Take your hands off.

12
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:27,147
Papers?

13
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:28,616
Passport?

14
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,954
Here you go.

15
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,794
Any other people on the boat?

16
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:41,996
Just the two of us.

17
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,499
<i>Nein.</i>

18
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,704
Come, come,
we have lots to eat...

19
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,639
Take your dirty hands off me!

20
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:54,108
Back off!

21
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:58,211
And you,

22
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,446
put your hands in the air!

23
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,661
Ooh!

24
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:14,996
You're in trouble now!

25
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,031
You've been a naughty boy!

26
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,170
I'll give you 100 francs
to shoot him.

27
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,236
Don't shoot me!

28
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,375
He hates Germans.
You should really shoot him.

29
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:32,013
I... I'm sorry.
You are very scary.

30
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,380
Make him walk the plank.

31
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,849
He loves wood.

32
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:41,321
Dirty drunken animal!

33
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,092
Guilty as charged.

34
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,508
I always take
a can of kerosene

35
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,409
for just
these sort of occasions.

36
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,246
It's been a while,

37
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,248
but the last time
someone laughed at me

38
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,917
when I boarded their vessel,

39
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,652
I gave them the choice.

40
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,521
Either swim to shore

41
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:16,256
or take their chances
on a burning ship.

42
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:21,629
Hans and I wondered
which option they'd choose,

43
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:24,732
death by water or death by fire.

44
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,400
Oddly, they chose both.

45
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:36,811
They waited
until the very last moment,

46
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:38,613
until their hair was on fire,

47
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:43,584
and their blistered skin
peeled from their fingers,

48
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:46,254
before they immersed
themselves in water

49
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,789
in the vain hope

50
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,322
of reaching shore.

51
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,726
One of them

52
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:54,562
sank immediately and perished.

53
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:57,231
But to our amazement,
the big one,

54
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,600
he showed great spirit.

55
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:02,637
<i>In spite of all the odds...</i>

56
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:05,973
<i>he painstakingly
made it to shore.</i>

57
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:08,075
We followed and cheered him on

58
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:10,978
and rewarded
this impressive achievement

59
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:13,147
with a bullet

60
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,416
to the back of his head.

61
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,288
Isn't that funny?

62
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:22,590
Why aren't you laughing?

63
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,540
Nice work, Lassen.

64
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,676
There's more
where that came from.

65
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:17,477
Yes.

66
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:25,219
Ah...

67
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:28,322
Not sure it's working, Lassen.

68
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,225
The captain
looks rather agitated.

69
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:38,366
They're bringing their guns
to bear.

70
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,605
They'll find their range
soon, sir.

71
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,874
Freddy, should we be worried?

72
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:48,441
Oh, I don't think so, sir.

73
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,411
It's a rather large explosive,
so I set a rather large fuse.

74
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,614
I located the outside
of the powder room,

75
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:54,916
so when it goes bang,

76
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,117
it really should go bang.

77
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,354
Closer...

78
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:01,856
Should be any second now, chaps.

79
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:08,529
Freddy?

80
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:15,269
Good work, Frederick.

81
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,470
Thank you, Captain.

82
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:18,572
Now, any chance you can tell us

83
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:19,640
what we're doing here, sir?

84
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:31,619
<i>The war in Europe rages on</i>

85
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:35,356
<i>as Hitler and his Nazi horde
sweep aside all in their path.</i>

86
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,892
<i>Poland, Belgium and now France</i>

87
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:41,062
<i>have all fallen
to Hitler's fascist regime,</i>

88
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:43,164
<i>leaving Britain
holding up the final hopes</i>

89
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,366
<i>of liberation
for all of Europe.</i>

90
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,202
<i>So, come on, Blighty,
get ready for a fighty.</i>

91
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,004
<i>But we cannot do it alone.</i>

92
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:52,273
<i>And any hope
for our American brothers</i>

93
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,241
<i>to join us
from across the Atlantic</i>

94
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:55,676
<i>remains frustrated</i>

95
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,046
<i>by Germany's secret weapon,
the U-boat.</i>

96
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,215
<i>These deadly little submarines</i>

97
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,117
<i>hunt at will
in the North Atlantic.</i>

98
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,921
<i>Undetectable, the U-boat
sinks ships indiscriminately,</i>

99
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,724
<i>whether carrying
munitions, provisions</i>

100
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,225
<i>or civilians heading</i>

101
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,594
<i>from our companions
across the pond.</i>

102
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:16,397
<i>So long as the U-boats
rule the Atlantic,</i>

103
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,765
<i>it remains impossible</i>

104
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,668
<i>for America's brave troops
to reach our shores.</i>

105
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:23,904
<i>Will Britain be forced
to appease Hitler's plans</i>

106
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:26,974
<i>or face devastation
from his offensive?</i>

107
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:29,577
<i>London burns
and her seas run red,</i>

108
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,613
<i>as bombs from above
and torpedoes from below</i>

109
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,081
<i>grind the Brits down.</i>

110
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:36,917
<i>And with no defense
against these lethal U-boats,</i>

111
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:39,253
<i>it appears all hope may be lost</i>

112
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,855
<i>for peace in Europe.</i>

113
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,460
The Germans cut off
our supply chain with U-boats,

114
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,231
we cut off the supply chain
to the U-boats.

115
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,067
Through our intelligence agents,

116
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:54,201
we've found a way.

117
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,142
<i>The entire</i>

118
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:04,612
<i>servicing, repairing,
and rearming</i>

119
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,516
<i>of Hitler's
Atlantic U-boat fleet...</i>

120
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,184
<i>is operated
by two Nazi tug boats...</i>

121
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,254
{\an8}<i>and an Italian supply ship
in Fernando Po.</i>

122
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,225
I need men who are willing
to go and sink those ships.

123
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,594
Why don't we just
air-raid Fernando Po

124
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:21,729
and sink the ships?

125
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:27,935
Because crafty Germans,
being crafty Germans,

126
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,505
<i>have positioned themselves
in a Spanish colony.</i>

127
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:33,174
<i>Fernando Po
is neutral territory.</i>

128
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:34,975
<i>If we attack that colony,</i>

129
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,611
<i>the rest of unoccupied Europe
will join the Nazis,</i>

130
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:38,813
<i>and it's only
a question of time</i>

131
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:39,880
<i>before we find ourselves</i>

132
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:41,449
<i>frying big pink sausages</i>

133
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:42,750
wearing nothing but lederhosen.

134
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,720
Hitler is not
playing by the rules

135
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:48,422
and neither are we.

136
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,959
This will of course be
an unsanctioned,

137
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:53,894
unauthorized
and unofficial mission.

138
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:57,631
If they're captured
by the British,

139
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:58,866
they'll be thrown in jail.

140
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,902
But if the Nazis find them...

141
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,940
it's torture and death.

142
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,676
<i>Somewhat contentiously,</i>

143
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,579
<i>I may have just the man,</i>

144
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,246
<i>but rather inconveniently,</i>

145
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,116
<i>he's currently incarcerated
at His Majesty's pleasure.</i>

146
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,451
<i>We may not like his attitude,</i>

147
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:20,589
but he's bold, he's a killer,

148
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:24,058
and the men
will follow him anywhere.

149
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,294
Are we sure this is a good idea?

150
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,731
Of course we're not.

151
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,099
But we're desperate.

152
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,069
Send him in.

153
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,237
Forward!

154
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:40,808
Stand there, Major.

155
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:55,456
Thank you, Sergeant.

156
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:01,495
Gus March-Phillips,

157
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:02,597
this is Lieutenant Commander...

158
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:04,999
Fleming. Ian Fleming.

159
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,535
He used to be
at Naval Intelligence,

160
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:07,701
now he works for me.

161
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,507
Why am I here, M?

162
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,209
I have a mission
I want you to lead.

163
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:18,112
Why are you asking me, M?

164
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,680
Help yourself
to a cup of tea, Major.

165
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,797
We both know that I'm...

166
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:42,403
not very popular
with the administration.

167
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,905
The reason
they find you unattractive

168
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:47,908
is the very reason
I find you attractive.

169
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:50,311
Mission?

170
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:51,845
Operation Postmaster.

171
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,414
To neutralize the German U-boats

172
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,516
in the North Atlantic.

173
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,022
And, uh, what's the plan?

174
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,857
The U-boats need

175
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,560
- fuel and torpedoes.
- Oh.

176
00:12:05,627 --> 00:12:06,661
But they also need

177
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:09,163
carbon dioxide filters
for oxygen.

178
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,165
Without them, they can't dive
and they can't hunt.

179
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:14,235
Stuck on the surface,
they're obsolete.

180
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,140
Target?

181
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:22,042
The <i>Duchessa d'Aosta.</i>

182
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:24,345
She's an Italian ship
the Germans have been using...

183
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,953
to refuel,
re-arm and replenish

184
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,756
the CO2 filters
for the entire fleet.

185
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:38,526
She's hidden
off the coast of West Africa.

186
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,028
A small island
called Fernando Po.

187
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:44,566
We want you to, um, sink her.

188
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:46,200
You'll be posing as fishermen

189
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,535
sailing down the west coast

190
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:49,537
on board a trawler
loaded with enough explosives

191
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:51,372
to destroy the <i>Duchessa.</i>

192
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:53,907
This is Agents
Heron and Stewart.

193
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,745
They'll be working
undercover on the island.

194
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,412
Mr. Heron's
already established there,

195
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,314
running various businesses.

196
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:01,549
What businesses?

197
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:05,319
A casino bar,
and illegal exports game.

198
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,656
Profitable?

199
00:13:07,722 --> 00:13:09,390
I do quite well.

200
00:13:09,423 --> 00:13:12,259
High-ranking Nazis
are my most valued clients.

201
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:13,762
Good for you.

202
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,166
Miss Stewart,
an actress and singer,

203
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,268
has been training with us
for the last two years.

204
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:22,436
She'll be posing

205
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,971
as a gold trader from New York.

206
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:25,839
Her mission is
to seduce and distract

207
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,841
the island's Commanding
Officer Heinrich Luhr.

208
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:30,944
She's very capable
and somewhat motivated.

209
00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:33,648
Motivated how, sir?

210
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:35,849
My mother's side
were German Jews.

211
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:38,753
They were the first to go.

212
00:13:38,787 --> 00:13:40,087
Very sorry to hear that.

213
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,690
I'm sure you'll recover.

214
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:43,324
We have 44 days

215
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,492
before the Nazis
move their operation.

216
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,695
We won't find them again.

217
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:53,100
If I'm to do this,
I'll need my own team.

218
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,436
You won't like them.
They're all, uh...

219
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,607
mad.

220
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:02,677
They'll need to be.
Give us their names.

221
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:07,782
Henry Hayes.

222
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:11,418
<i>A smart, young Irishman
who hates the Nazis</i>

223
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:12,754
<i>because his older brother,</i>

224
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:14,756
<i>who was a close friend of mine,</i>

225
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:17,792
<i>drowned after a U-boat
sank his fishing trawler.</i>

226
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:20,795
<i>I've taken him under my wing
ever since.</i>

227
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:22,863
He's cunning, quiet and wily.

228
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,164
More to the point,

229
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,234
Hayes is a magnificent sailor
and I trust him.

230
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:30,971
If we're going
to try and sink a large ship,

231
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:34,108
we'll need
Freddy "The Buzz" frogman.

232
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:37,344
<i>He can swim across the channel
with his feet tied together.</i>

233
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:38,780
<i>Admittedly,</i>

234
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:40,582
<i>he's a convicted arsonist
and a terrible misery</i>

235
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:42,817
<i>unless
he's destroying something.</i>

236
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:45,352
But he's very good
at blowing things up.

237
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:49,223
Next, we'll need
the Danish hammer.

238
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,159
Anders Lassen.

239
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,360
<i>Grew up wrestling bears</i>

240
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:55,162
<i>and hunting elk
on his family estate.</i>

241
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,363
<i>He's a legend</i>

242
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:58,432
<i>with a Bowie knife
and a bow and arrow.</i>

243
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,702
<i>He ran away at 18
to fight the Nazis</i>

244
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:03,303
<i>after the Gestapo tortured
his brother to death.</i>

245
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:06,574
<i>He gave up filleting game
for gutting Nazis.</i>

246
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:08,275
He then turned up on our shores

247
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,910
ready to fight alongside us.

248
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:12,179
He is an uncontrollable mad dog

249
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,348
who knows
a hundred creative ways

250
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:15,449
to kill a man.

251
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:17,886
And finally,

252
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:21,288
and most importantly,
we'll need Geoffrey Appleyard.

253
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:25,092
Yes, we thought you might.

254
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,795
That's why we sent him

255
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:28,563
<i>on a reconnaissance mission
to Fernando Po.</i>

256
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:29,631
Unfortunately,

257
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:31,031
the Nazis nabbed him
on his return.

258
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:34,401
All the more reason.
He knows what we need to know.

259
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:36,771
He's a master planner,

260
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:40,274
a master survivor,
a chess grand master

261
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,042
and a surgeon with the blade.

262
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:48,382
<i>We spent two weeks together
in a Dunkirk foxhole</i>

263
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:51,920
<i>and if it wasn't for Apple,
I would still be there today.</i>

264
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:54,756
No Apple, no mission.

265
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:56,891
I'm afraid that's impossible.

266
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:57,958
Why?

267
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,828
<i>Because he's being held</i>

268
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:02,764
<i>by an entire German garrison
on La Palma.</i>

269
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,167
La Palma's on the way.

270
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:10,672
- That's insanity.
- You let me worry about that.

271
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,678
I must get me
one of those coats.

272
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:45,439
Now, any chance you can tell us

273
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,674
what we're doing here, sir?

274
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:49,009
Dry yourself off, frogman,
and I'll tell you.

275
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,278
The curiosity is
eating us all up, sir.

276
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,519
{\an8}<i>I apologize
for all the secrecy, chaps.</i>

277
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,754
But this is

278
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:05,225
an unsanctioned, unofficial
and unauthorized mission.

279
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,027
If we're picked up by the Brits,

280
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,128
we will all go to jail.

281
00:17:09,964 --> 00:17:11,699
If we're picked up
by the Germans,

282
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:12,800
torture and death.

283
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,069
So, it's just
the four of us then?

284
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,372
And Captain Appleyard.

285
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,308
He's responsible
for securing this information.

286
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:24,512
He is, however,
in a spot of bother.

287
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:27,414
He is being held
by the Germans on La Palma.

288
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:29,017
Our first job
is to liberate him.

289
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,552
- Oh, so, that's all, is it?
- No.

290
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:32,587
We need to confirm
Appleyard's intelligence.

291
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:34,388
That's why
there are two more agents

292
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:37,025
on their way to Fernando Po
by train, as we speak.

293
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,860
Doing what, exactly?

294
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:39,994
They'll be ensuring

295
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,095
that those ships
are filled with supplies,

296
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,364
so they're worth blowing up
in the first place.

297
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,906
{\an8}It's one thing
taking over the world,

298
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:54,042
but do they have to
take over the kitchen too?

299
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:58,580
It's all sausage,
cabbage and black bread.

300
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:00,447
Who would
you have preferred?

301
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:04,284
The French offer
the refined classical take.

302
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:07,956
<i>Cote de boeuf,
fromage, le beurre...</i>

303
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:10,024
<i>ca suffit!</i>

304
00:18:10,058 --> 00:18:13,061
What about the rustic
spontaneity of the Italians?

305
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:18,766
Their oils, the linguine,
the tomatoes.

306
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,569
I'd climb over the linguine
to get to the fettucine.

307
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:23,738
But the cinghiale.

308
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:24,806
Mmm.

309
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:27,642
You have me with the wild boar.

310
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:31,546
But then again,
the Spanish offer

311
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:32,614
the smorgasbord

312
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,084
of the regional paella
and tapas.

313
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,452
And Jamon Iberico Andalucia.

314
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,388
So?

315
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,891
We're between
a rock and a hard place.

316
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:45,325
If the Brits win the war,

317
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,061
we're stuck with fish and chips.

318
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:49,129
If the Germans win the war,

319
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:52,265
we're stuck with this menu.

320
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,434
So?

321
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,405
We'll have the sausage,
the cabbage

322
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,774
and the black bread please.

323
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:02,110
<i>Tres bien. Merci.</i>

324
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,494
Our situation?

325
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:22,797
Steady.

326
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,608
Steady.

327
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:41,983
Now.

328
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:55,830
Mmm.

329
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:03,838
I'm exhausted.

330
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:26,359
<i>Entschuldigung, bitte.</i>

331
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:35,937
Halt!

332
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:53,221
Is there a problem?

333
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:05,800
I can manage
myself, thank you.

334
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:10,470
Allow me, Miss Stewart.

335
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,154
Allow me.

336
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:27,789
Thank you.

337
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:31,324
<i>Prost!</i>

338
00:21:47,642 --> 00:21:48,676
Door.

339
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:50,845
Locked.

340
00:21:57,718 --> 00:21:59,120
Case?

341
00:21:59,153 --> 00:22:00,353
Working on it.

342
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,781
Sir, contact.

343
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:30,151
Contact.

344
00:22:30,818 --> 00:22:31,953
Standing by.

345
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:38,960
<i>Duchessa's</i> manifest. Ready?

346
00:22:38,993 --> 00:22:41,394
- Ready.
- 400 B-grade torpedoes. Check.

347
00:22:44,332 --> 00:22:46,167
400 B-grade torpedoes.

348
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,367
Check.

349
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:48,468
Check.

350
00:22:48,502 --> 00:22:50,338
5,000 tons of diesel. Check.

351
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:55,877
5,000 tons of diesel.

352
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:56,978
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir?

353
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:58,212
Check.

354
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,747
Check.

355
00:22:59,814 --> 00:23:01,983
10,000 carbon dioxide filters.
Check.

356
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,187
End of message from Stork, sir.

357
00:23:06,687 --> 00:23:07,722
Confirm receipt.

358
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:10,490
Receipt confirmed.

359
00:23:10,524 --> 00:23:11,826
Urgent, Chequers.

360
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:14,362
Get the car ready.
Inform Fleming.

361
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:15,529
Let's pack it up.

362
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:18,232
No point robbing the bank

363
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,767
if there's no gold in the vault.

364
00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:27,708
Thank you.

365
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:28,943
It's truly comforting to know

366
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,012
there's at least one gentleman
in the world.

367
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:33,948
Ah!
Idiot!

368
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:38,586
Good day.

369
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:56,436
Sausage, cabbage
and black bread.

370
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,145
<i>Hitler
has made us an offer.</i>

371
00:24:04,178 --> 00:24:05,413
<i>An appeasement.</i>

372
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,214
<i>But we must step down our army,</i>

373
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:10,518
{\an8}<i>surrender our Navy
and accept Nazi rule.</i>

374
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:12,485
{\an8}<i>Otherwise, he promises</i>

375
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,324
<i>total destruction of Britain
and her empire.</i>

376
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,092
Our best option

377
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,561
is to take Hitler's deal
while we can.

378
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:23,931
The Air Marshal agrees.

379
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:28,636
He has more bombs,
more men, more machines.

380
00:24:28,703 --> 00:24:30,671
We won't survive much longer.

381
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:33,908
You have to make
the only decision you can make

382
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:35,710
<i>in good conscience,
Prime Minister.</i>

383
00:24:35,743 --> 00:24:38,012
<i>Good God, girls.
Listen to yourselves.</i>

384
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:40,414
<i>It's not appeasement,
it's surrender.</i>

385
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,017
You still fail to realize
who we're up against.

386
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:46,821
With respect, Prime Minister,
it's you who doesn't realize.

387
00:24:46,854 --> 00:24:48,522
We cannot hope to defeat him.

388
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:53,194
Hitler is
the mainspring of evil,

389
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:55,029
a guttersnipe.

390
00:24:55,096 --> 00:24:57,031
This is not a man
that we can negotiate with.

391
00:24:57,098 --> 00:24:59,000
I've read his book,
Admiral Pound.

392
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:02,169
The man is a vicious,
victimized ideologue.

393
00:25:02,236 --> 00:25:03,270
He cannot be trusted.

394
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,041
If I thought that
we could've achieved peace

395
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:08,142
through surrendering,

396
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:09,944
I'd have done it already.

397
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:12,413
<i>We need to stop our country
from starving.</i>

398
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:14,615
<i>We need
three million tons of supplies</i>

399
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:17,051
to cross the Atlantic
every month.

400
00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:19,553
We are currently losing
50% of that to U-boat attacks.

401
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,323
Another reason to take the deal.

402
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:24,725
I've not finished,
Algernon, darling.

403
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:27,728
<i>We need the Americans,</i>

404
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:29,563
<i>and they will
never enter the war</i>

405
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:31,532
<i>if we already appear
to be a losing side.</i>

406
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,968
Ending hostilities with Germany

407
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:36,037
is the best path
out of this mess.

408
00:25:36,103 --> 00:25:39,206
We are all in agreement,
Prime Minister.

409
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:41,375
Thank you, gentlemen.

410
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:46,847
Yes,
thank you, gentlemen!

411
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:54,889
<i>M, Fleming,
this better be good news.</i>

412
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:56,157
<i>Prime Minister,</i>

413
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,059
<i>we have the manifest here, sir.</i>

414
00:25:58,092 --> 00:25:59,326
<i>It's been confirmed</i>

415
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,095
<i>the</i> Duchessa
<i>is fully laden with supplies</i>

416
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:03,597
to keep the U-boats
operational indefinitely.

417
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:07,401
If we're going to sink her,
now is the time.

418
00:26:07,468 --> 00:26:08,903
They're on their way.

419
00:26:10,171 --> 00:26:11,338
And their chances?

420
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:14,543
Well, if anyone can, they can.

421
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:20,347
But if we're discovered,

422
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:22,750
parliament will remove you
from office.

423
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,454
Well,

424
00:26:26,521 --> 00:26:28,523
we'd better make sure
we're not discovered then.

425
00:26:31,926 --> 00:26:33,194
We'll take it
from the cliffside.

426
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:35,463
It's an 85-foot sheer climb.

427
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,565
No one should notice

428
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,699
a small, innocuous
fishing vessel.

429
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:41,268
We'll set up in the woods
and see what we're up against,

430
00:26:41,335 --> 00:26:43,137
then we'll go for a night raid.

431
00:26:43,204 --> 00:26:46,107
Slip in quietly,
find Apple, come out fast.

432
00:26:46,575 --> 00:26:47,808
Numbers?

433
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:50,478
Intelligence suggests
a garrison of 50 to 60.

434
00:26:51,712 --> 00:26:53,380
That should be about 15 each.

435
00:26:53,414 --> 00:26:57,051
Lassen, try not to be greedy.
You do have a reputation.

436
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:59,420
My killing days are over.

437
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:01,822
I'm just here
as a peacekeeping observer.

438
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:06,627
Freddy, bag the kit,
silence the weapons.

439
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:52,641
When do we go?

440
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:54,308
0200.

441
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:57,111
Take the towers first,
then move onto the radio room,

442
00:27:57,144 --> 00:27:59,548
barracks and end up
in the control room...

443
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:03,284
What do we have here?

444
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:05,286
Gestapo.

445
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,687
How'd you know?

446
00:28:06,754 --> 00:28:09,890
The badder they are,
the better they're dressed.

447
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:12,026
I really must get me
one of those coats.

448
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:13,894
They must be here for Apple.

449
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:17,865
It's either torture
or, uh, extraction, sir.

450
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:20,301
If they extract him,
it'll be the end of Apple.

451
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:21,468
We won't be seeing him again.

452
00:28:22,504 --> 00:28:23,704
I'm afraid, gentlemen,

453
00:28:23,771 --> 00:28:25,239
we're not going
to have the luxury of night.

454
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:26,707
We're going
to have to go in now.

455
00:28:39,753 --> 00:28:40,921
So,
what's happened there then?

456
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:42,156
It looks like

457
00:28:42,189 --> 00:28:43,424
they've been plugged
full of arrows, Haysey.

458
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,659
Well, where did the arrows go?

459
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:46,760
Straight through them.

460
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:52,900
There were
two more round the other side.

461
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:54,268
Where are they now?

462
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:56,203
Same place as these two.

463
00:28:56,237 --> 00:28:57,371
Nazi heaven.

464
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:59,106
Well, we've got
less than seven minutes

465
00:28:59,173 --> 00:29:00,575
before they're missed.

466
00:29:00,642 --> 00:29:02,743
Alarms, dogs. None of it good.

467
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:05,513
Go undercover of the engine.

468
00:29:05,547 --> 00:29:07,381
Only break cover
when things go bang.

469
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:12,186
I have a great idea, Lassen.

470
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:13,954
Why don't you march off
by yourself

471
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:15,590
and fill those Germans
full of arrows?

472
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:28,402
Freddy, grab the scissors
and help him with that fence.

473
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:29,470
Aye, sir.

474
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:51,392
Haysey, you're with me.
We go left.

475
00:29:51,425 --> 00:29:54,061
Freddy, Lassen, you go right.

476
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:55,829
Fill your boots, gentlemen,
and bon appetit.

477
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:01,335
See you at the tower.

478
00:30:01,402 --> 00:30:03,304
And remember, gentlemen,
try to have fun.

479
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:44,546
So far, so good.

480
00:30:44,612 --> 00:30:46,514
Doing rather well, Haysey.

481
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:47,682
Oh, why thank you, sir.

482
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:06,735
It's very good.

483
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:46,775
Sounds like
stealth mode's over.

484
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:48,041
Haysey, down!

485
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:56,176
<i>Nein! Nein!</i>

486
00:33:28,643 --> 00:33:29,677
Do we know each other?

487
00:33:30,612 --> 00:33:32,446
No.

488
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:51,031
Is that a heart, Lassen?

489
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:52,634
For the avoidance of doubt.

490
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,669
Apple, old boy.

491
00:33:54,702 --> 00:33:56,504
- Gus.
- I see you two have met.

492
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,072
This is Haysey.

493
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:01,743
- Pleasure, Haysey.
- Pleasure's mine.

494
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:03,176
I thought you might need these.

495
00:34:03,978 --> 00:34:05,880
Jolly thoughtful of you.

496
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:06,981
You all find him?

497
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,684
Oh, goody.

498
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:13,086
Bloody hell,
what happened to your nipples?

499
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:19,493
You all right?

500
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:22,229
Couldn't unplug me, could you?
Battery's still on.

501
00:35:39,874 --> 00:35:41,776
Did you see the <i>Duchessa,</i>

502
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,411
the tug boats?

503
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:46,848
And rather
a lot of Nazi soldiers.

504
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:49,584
Why wasn't that in your report?

505
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:53,855
Because those soldiers
and those guns,

506
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:56,591
and those S-Boats are all new.

507
00:35:58,092 --> 00:36:01,328
That's a lot more
than the boys are expecting.

508
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:03,463
A month ago,
it was a dozen mechanics.

509
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:04,766
Six drunk sailors.

510
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,034
Two fat Spaniards.

511
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,802
And a Nazi in a pear tree.

512
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:12,372
I'd say,
we're gonna need more help.

513
00:36:14,307 --> 00:36:15,643
You leave that to me.

514
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:17,145
Of course.

515
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:21,516
But right now...

516
00:36:21,582 --> 00:36:23,851
you need to meet that man.

517
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:29,189
Your man.
The reason you're here.

518
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:31,059
Ah.

519
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:33,326
The only thing
worse than a Nazi...

520
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:35,630
is him.

521
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:05,159
I'm very disappointed, Heron.

522
00:37:05,193 --> 00:37:07,427
There are 16 crates
in my warehouse

523
00:37:07,494 --> 00:37:10,131
you have not yet
shipped to the mainland.

524
00:37:10,164 --> 00:37:11,999
No need to fret, <i>Herr</i> Luhr.

525
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,568
They'll still be delivered
by the agreed date.

526
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:14,902
That may be.

527
00:37:14,936 --> 00:37:17,171
But they take up valuable space.

528
00:37:17,205 --> 00:37:18,238
For this, I expect

529
00:37:18,305 --> 00:37:20,575
a significant reduction
in your fee.

530
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:23,544
I can do 5%...

531
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:25,046
as a gesture of goodwill.

532
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,683
Twenty. And don't waste
my precious time haggling.

533
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:29,751
Well,
strictly speaking,

534
00:37:29,817 --> 00:37:31,119
there should be no reductions,

535
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:34,254
since there's not yet been
any breach of contract.

536
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:38,226
Five is more than polite,
20 rings like a sour note,

537
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,861
it jars.

538
00:37:40,528 --> 00:37:42,262
It jars?

539
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:45,032
Am I being
accused of disharmony?

540
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:47,400
I take that
as a personal affront.

541
00:37:50,171 --> 00:37:53,708
And I am supposing
you are not the secretary.

542
00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:56,744
Miss Stewart is the contact
I said I'd arrange.

543
00:37:56,778 --> 00:37:59,547
Ah, your New York gold contact?

544
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:01,616
I told you,

545
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:04,085
I already have
a satisfying arrangement.

546
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:05,887
Have a seat.

547
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,121
Thank you.

548
00:38:12,026 --> 00:38:14,228
Well,
I hope I don't disappoint.

549
00:38:17,064 --> 00:38:19,466
I can't make a decision
on this presentation.

550
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:21,068
Early days.

551
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:23,303
Well, if early days
do come too soon,

552
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,472
and seasons change
with a Hunter's Moon.

553
00:38:33,281 --> 00:38:34,314
Hmm.

554
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:36,684
Hmm.

555
00:38:36,751 --> 00:38:37,785
I have to say, Heron,

556
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:39,153
for all your flaws,

557
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,622
you do have a habit
of pulling rabbits from hats.

558
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:49,096
So, how much gold
do you wish to move,

559
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,330
Miss Stewart?

560
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:54,769
As much as you can find.

561
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:01,943
As I mentioned before,

562
00:39:01,976 --> 00:39:05,179
I do already have
a very profitable arrangement.

563
00:39:05,246 --> 00:39:07,615
And despite of your commentary,

564
00:39:07,648 --> 00:39:10,383
I pride myself
on maintaining harmony.

565
00:39:11,418 --> 00:39:14,354
Now, why should I entertain you?

566
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:19,327
Because you'll make more money
and have lots of fun

567
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,528
whilst doing so.

568
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:25,700
If I'm not good for my word,
don't pay me.

569
00:39:41,682 --> 00:39:42,717
Bravo.

570
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,088
I will talk to my people
and then we'll rendezvous.

571
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:48,923
Lovely.

572
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:55,062
When the sly red cat
barks at dawn,

573
00:39:55,096 --> 00:39:56,898
and kills just for her pleasure,

574
00:39:56,964 --> 00:39:59,834
who shares the meal
the cat did steal

575
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:01,535
when both looked on in pleasure?

576
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:05,405
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

577
00:40:52,586 --> 00:40:54,121
The riddle was a nice touch.

578
00:40:57,758 --> 00:40:58,893
The hook's in.

579
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:03,998
Now be careful
how you reel him in.

580
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:16,444
I'll make sure
the harbor's empty

581
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:17,812
when the boys arrive.

582
00:41:19,246 --> 00:41:21,182
How are you going to do that?

583
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:23,150
I'll throw a party at my club.

584
00:41:23,184 --> 00:41:25,686
A costume party for the officers

585
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:27,855
and a second party at the dock
for the soldiers.

586
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:30,691
People like my parties.

587
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:32,994
Everyone but Luhr.

588
00:41:33,627 --> 00:41:35,429
That will be your job.

589
00:41:35,463 --> 00:41:37,497
All the rats
will follow the piper.

590
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:46,207
So,
if I understand correctly,

591
00:41:46,273 --> 00:41:47,675
we're currently
here in La Palma.

592
00:41:47,742 --> 00:41:49,610
We'll sail around
German-controlled Africa

593
00:41:49,643 --> 00:41:50,678
to Fernando Po,

594
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:52,446
which is just
north of the Equator,

595
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,281
just off the West African coast.

596
00:41:54,315 --> 00:41:56,183
So that's the shortest route?

597
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,852
Yes, but we don't
want to go shorter.

598
00:41:57,918 --> 00:41:59,854
Our priority is not to be seen.

599
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,289
You mean, be seen again.

600
00:42:02,323 --> 00:42:05,659
Again? Getting a little sloppy
on us now, Gussy?

601
00:42:05,693 --> 00:42:07,161
Had a run-in already?

602
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:08,963
Never mind us, Apple, old boy.

603
00:42:09,697 --> 00:42:11,065
Remind me again

604
00:42:11,132 --> 00:42:12,633
how you found your nipples
attached to a car battery.

605
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:15,636
Yes. Wasn't my fault.

606
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:17,405
Bad intelligence.
Plus it was almost worth it

607
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,739
to watch
the heart-snatcher at work.

608
00:42:18,806 --> 00:42:20,741
I'm better known as a lover
than a fighter.

609
00:42:20,808 --> 00:42:22,043
Jesus Christ!

610
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:23,677
If that's how you fight,
I'd hate to see you love.

611
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:25,179
You don't have
to worry about that,

612
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,416
you're too pretty for me.

613
00:42:28,482 --> 00:42:30,384
Freddy, on the other hand...

614
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:33,522
You'd have to catch me first.

615
00:42:34,155 --> 00:42:35,524
I do love to hunt.

616
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,925
You'd be lucky.

617
00:42:38,726 --> 00:42:40,094
I'm really getting quite hot.

618
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:42,963
Anyway, my suggestion is
that we take this wider route.

619
00:42:42,997 --> 00:42:44,331
<i>It's obviously longer</i>

620
00:42:44,365 --> 00:42:45,599
<i>but it should avoid
any awkward conversations</i>

621
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:48,369
<i>with German U-boats
or British warships.</i>

622
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:49,504
<i>Weather-dependent,</i>

623
00:42:49,538 --> 00:42:51,372
<i>we should make it there
in 15 days.</i>

624
00:42:52,373 --> 00:42:53,542
Agreed.

625
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:55,544
Haysey, do you think
you could manage that?

626
00:42:56,377 --> 00:42:57,411
Leave it to me, sir.

627
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:22,870
Just do as you're told

628
00:43:22,903 --> 00:43:24,472
and get me another drink!

629
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:25,639
Captain, sir.

630
00:43:25,706 --> 00:43:26,974
Can I get you something to eat?

631
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:28,242
May I... Come this way.

632
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:29,544
Take your hands off me.

633
00:43:32,346 --> 00:43:33,380
You know,

634
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:35,916
I like you, Femi.

635
00:43:37,751 --> 00:43:40,888
But you touch me again
and you're going to jail.

636
00:43:40,921 --> 00:43:41,956
Femi.

637
00:43:47,194 --> 00:43:48,262
I'll deal with him.

638
00:43:49,196 --> 00:43:50,599
Please take care
of Miss Stewart.

639
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,302
You know what you need,
Captain Binea?

640
00:43:55,369 --> 00:43:56,403
I know what I need.

641
00:43:57,204 --> 00:44:00,141
But do you, Ricardo?

642
00:44:01,543 --> 00:44:03,177
You need another drink.

643
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,014
Marty,

644
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:08,482
good stuff.

645
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,785
Ricardo, that's why I love you.

646
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:13,320
You understand.

647
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:15,524
This is Fernando Po.

648
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:17,858
Everybody's welcome.

649
00:44:18,959 --> 00:44:21,128
<i>Si...</i> Everybody.

650
00:44:22,396 --> 00:44:23,831
Too many body I think.

651
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:29,036
Armando?

652
00:44:30,304 --> 00:44:32,439
Have you fallen out
with our new friends?

653
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:34,308
It's not fair, Ricardo.

654
00:44:35,142 --> 00:44:36,545
This is my harbor.

655
00:44:37,444 --> 00:44:38,979
I am in charge.

656
00:44:39,013 --> 00:44:40,649
Are they stepping on your toes?

657
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:41,782
They don't step, they stamp!

658
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:43,784
They tell Captain Binea nothing.

659
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:48,756
Only now do I hear

660
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:50,391
the <i>Duchessa</i>
is leaving the harbor early.

661
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,161
Well, good riddance.

662
00:44:55,262 --> 00:44:56,997
The harbor will be yours again.

663
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:01,468
When will you be free
of that ugly vessel?

664
00:45:02,203 --> 00:45:03,505
Three days earlier.

665
00:45:04,772 --> 00:45:06,675
Then we should
have another drink.

666
00:45:07,676 --> 00:45:09,710
To celebrate. Marty...

667
00:45:09,777 --> 00:45:11,879
Another round
for our Harbor Master.

668
00:45:13,214 --> 00:45:16,850
So, Captain, do you know
where they wish to relocate?

669
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:20,354
It's neither cat nor dog
that kills for fun,

670
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:23,490
it's the vixen, not another.

671
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:26,927
There's only two
that kill for fun,

672
00:45:26,994 --> 00:45:29,363
my pretty friend,

673
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:32,433
the fox and his human brother.

674
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:51,586
I believe I have
resolved your little riddle.

675
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,923
<i>Chapeau.</i> You play well.

676
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:00,861
Speaking of foxes,

677
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:05,533
Horowitz and Meyer,
West 47th Street.

678
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:07,401
Have you heard of them?

679
00:46:08,536 --> 00:46:09,870
I don't believe I have, no.

680
00:46:43,738 --> 00:46:45,172
They're the largest gold traders

681
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:47,074
in Midtown New York

682
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:48,677
and you haven't heard of them?

683
00:46:49,744 --> 00:46:51,478
I'm afraid I haven't, no.

684
00:46:53,715 --> 00:46:56,016
I am familiar, of course,
with Horowitz and Haim.

685
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:58,485
But they're in the west side
of the city.

686
00:47:01,055 --> 00:47:02,256
But then again,

687
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:04,258
I'm sure you already
knew that, didn't you?

688
00:47:10,598 --> 00:47:11,633
I'm curious,

689
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:15,269
how do you find
dealing with the Jew?

690
00:47:16,337 --> 00:47:18,506
Oh, dear.

691
00:47:18,573 --> 00:47:19,641
I've slipped from one snare

692
00:47:19,674 --> 00:47:21,442
only to find myself in another.

693
00:47:23,243 --> 00:47:24,345
How shall I put this?

694
00:47:25,112 --> 00:47:26,380
I fear your brilliant leader

695
00:47:26,447 --> 00:47:28,849
has mischaracterized
the ancient tribe of Jahuda.

696
00:47:29,517 --> 00:47:30,785
Their ability to not only

697
00:47:30,819 --> 00:47:33,354
survive 3,000 years
with a boot on their neck,

698
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,691
but to prosper in spite of it...

699
00:47:36,725 --> 00:47:39,828
I suspect it inspired
satanic jealousy within him.

700
00:47:40,695 --> 00:47:42,029
In conclusion,

701
00:47:42,764 --> 00:47:44,131
it looks as though

702
00:47:44,164 --> 00:47:47,000
the lady doth protest too much.

703
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:54,576
Is there a cherry to go
on this blasphemous cake,

704
00:47:54,642 --> 00:47:55,844
or have you finished?

705
00:48:00,515 --> 00:48:02,916
I must confess,

706
00:48:02,983 --> 00:48:05,553
not only do I respect
and admire the Jew...

707
00:48:08,322 --> 00:48:09,524
I am one.

708
00:48:31,011 --> 00:48:32,045
Kidding!

709
00:48:33,548 --> 00:48:34,849
They're greedy rats.

710
00:48:38,686 --> 00:48:39,788
I think this could be

711
00:48:39,854 --> 00:48:41,922
the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

712
00:48:43,525 --> 00:48:45,959
Then I shall throw a party
to celebrate.

713
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:47,928
I don't care for parties.

714
00:48:47,995 --> 00:48:51,566
Oh, spoilsport!
Everybody loves a party.

715
00:48:53,902 --> 00:48:54,935
The <i>Duchessa's</i> leaving

716
00:48:55,002 --> 00:48:57,137
three days earlier
than we thought.

717
00:48:57,171 --> 00:48:58,439
If we don't tell
the <i>Maid Honor,</i>

718
00:48:59,607 --> 00:49:00,909
they'll arrive too late.

719
00:49:11,418 --> 00:49:12,654
Incoming.

720
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:15,155
Contact.

721
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,726
More Jerries
on the island than expected.

722
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,596
Tin of corned beef's
out of pantry

723
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:23,464
three days early.

724
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:28,570
I'll take that.

725
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:30,070
It's confidential,
sir. For M only.

726
00:49:32,439 --> 00:49:33,608
When it comes
to make the extraction,

727
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:34,676
it needs to be a very...

728
00:49:34,742 --> 00:49:35,910
Sir. Message, sir.

729
00:49:39,714 --> 00:49:43,150
More Jerries
on the island than expected.

730
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:46,654
Corned beef's out of the pantry

731
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:47,755
three days early.

732
00:49:48,756 --> 00:49:50,658
Move faster.

733
00:49:50,692 --> 00:49:53,327
Yes, but there's increased
U-boat sightings in the area.

734
00:49:53,795 --> 00:49:54,829
Sir.

735
00:50:01,736 --> 00:50:03,136
The mission's
still proceeding.

736
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,375
So, there's more
soldiers on the island

737
00:50:08,442 --> 00:50:09,644
and the boat's leaving earlier?

738
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:10,712
Yes.

739
00:50:10,778 --> 00:50:12,279
Well, how are
we meant to move faster?

740
00:50:12,312 --> 00:50:13,648
We can't move faster.

741
00:50:13,681 --> 00:50:15,282
We're going as fast as we can.

742
00:50:15,315 --> 00:50:17,519
This is a fishing boat,
it's not a speedboat.

743
00:50:18,151 --> 00:50:19,521
<i>Prime Minister,</i>

744
00:50:19,554 --> 00:50:21,589
<i>the</i> Duchessa's <i>leaving</i>
<i>Fernando Po in 12 days.</i>

745
00:50:21,623 --> 00:50:23,123
<i>On our current schedule,</i>

746
00:50:23,156 --> 00:50:24,792
<i>they'll arrive
three days too late.</i>

747
00:50:26,628 --> 00:50:28,228
Can it still be done?

748
00:50:28,262 --> 00:50:29,998
<i>We're still
awaiting a response</i>

749
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,064
<i>from Major Phillips.</i>

750
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:34,969
If we can't move faster,
we'll go shorter.

751
00:50:35,003 --> 00:50:36,804
We can get to Fernando Po
in 12 days.

752
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:38,171
Hold on, you said
we couldn't go shorter.

753
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:40,008
No, I said
we don't want to go shorter.

754
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,844
He said we'll get
mowed down by a U-boat.

755
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:46,146
Or worse,
picked up by the Brits.

756
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:47,882
Their armada of destroyers
are crossing there.

757
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:50,752
We will literally
be sailing over U-boats.

758
00:50:51,553 --> 00:50:54,087
Sorry, lads, we go shorter.

759
00:51:16,878 --> 00:51:20,247
<i>Drei, zwei, eins...</i>

760
00:51:42,235 --> 00:51:44,471
<i>Gentlemen,
as I speak to you now,</i>

761
00:51:45,172 --> 00:51:46,741
<i>London once again</i>

762
00:51:46,774 --> 00:51:49,744
<i>shudders beneath a Nazi
onslaught from the skies.</i>

763
00:51:50,612 --> 00:51:51,813
<i>And at such times,</i>

764
00:51:51,846 --> 00:51:55,083
<i>the hearts of men
are stirred to duty.</i>

765
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:56,316
<i>But you are not such men.</i>

766
00:51:56,951 --> 00:51:58,185
<i>You were not chosen</i>

767
00:51:58,218 --> 00:52:01,321
<i>for your conspicuous honor
or high ideals.</i>

768
00:52:01,355 --> 00:52:02,389
<i>You were chosen</i>

769
00:52:02,422 --> 00:52:04,324
<i>because you are
the last resort.</i>

770
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:05,492
<i>The mission
you have been given</i>

771
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:09,162
<i>is of a sort
never before undertaken.</i>

772
00:52:09,196 --> 00:52:13,701
<i>It demands ruthless men,
who will not hesitate</i>

773
00:52:13,735 --> 00:52:17,471
<i>to stoop beneath
the conventions of war.</i>

774
00:52:17,538 --> 00:52:19,741
Men who do not keep clean hands.

775
00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:23,243
Men like you.

776
00:52:23,276 --> 00:52:24,879
<i>And yet, who still conspire</i>

777
00:52:24,912 --> 00:52:27,582
<i>in their own
discordant harmony.</i>

778
00:52:27,615 --> 00:52:32,419
<i>Who know and yet do not care
that they may never return.</i>

779
00:52:32,452 --> 00:52:35,623
<i>And who press onward
not for glory,</i>

780
00:52:35,657 --> 00:52:38,126
<i>or for duty, or for me,</i>

781
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:40,862
<i>but because you are men
who will not stop</i>

782
00:52:40,895 --> 00:52:41,929
<i>until it is done.</i>

783
00:52:43,064 --> 00:52:44,498
<i>Godspeed, gentlemen.</i>

784
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:56,544
Uh... Chaps...

785
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:00,114
That's a British destroyer.

786
00:53:03,483 --> 00:53:05,352
We should move.

787
00:53:05,419 --> 00:53:06,954
We can't outrun that, sir.

788
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:13,161
Well, we've seen them,
they've seen us.

789
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:20,902
Hold fast, <i>Maid Honor.</i>

790
00:53:20,968 --> 00:53:22,737
We're preparing
a boarding party.

791
00:53:22,804 --> 00:53:24,172
Hello, Captain!

792
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:27,240
Nothing exciting here.

793
00:53:27,307 --> 00:53:29,242
We're just Swedish fishermen.

794
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:30,978
Step forward, Jorgensen!

795
00:53:32,613 --> 00:53:33,881
Jorgensen, you're Swedish.

796
00:53:33,948 --> 00:53:35,482
Ask them where
they're heading, would you?

797
00:53:40,788 --> 00:53:41,923
Not you, Lassen.

798
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:43,024
Uh...

799
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:47,227
I want to hear March-Phillips
have a go.

800
00:53:47,862 --> 00:53:48,896
Ah.

801
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:52,533
Fair enough.

802
00:53:52,567 --> 00:53:54,936
Game's up, Commander.

803
00:53:55,002 --> 00:53:56,369
Can't blame a girl for trying.

804
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:57,739
Good effort, Major.

805
00:53:57,805 --> 00:54:00,041
But I'm afraid you are going
to have to come with us.

806
00:54:00,074 --> 00:54:01,909
May I ask under whose authority

807
00:54:01,976 --> 00:54:03,443
we've been waylaid?

808
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:05,046
On the orders of Admiral Pound.

809
00:54:09,984 --> 00:54:11,018
First Lieutenant.

810
00:54:11,052 --> 00:54:12,086
You are pursuing

811
00:54:12,153 --> 00:54:14,889
an unsanctioned
criminal enterprise

812
00:54:14,922 --> 00:54:17,290
in international waters.

813
00:54:17,357 --> 00:54:19,093
You're going to cause an upset.

814
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,730
I think we're a little
past upset, Commander.

815
00:54:22,764 --> 00:54:24,364
Stevens, what have you got?

816
00:54:24,397 --> 00:54:25,700
I had a ping, sir.

817
00:54:26,534 --> 00:54:27,769
The greedy little Nazi

818
00:54:27,835 --> 00:54:30,403
won't be satisfied
with holding most of Europe,

819
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:33,074
he's after our own
green and pleasant land.

820
00:54:33,107 --> 00:54:34,407
Well, thank God you're here

821
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:35,777
with your little
wooden battleship

822
00:54:35,843 --> 00:54:38,045
and your five-man army.

823
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,748
U-boat, bearing 273.

824
00:54:40,782 --> 00:54:42,116
Sound the alarm.

825
00:54:42,183 --> 00:54:43,551
Come aboard.

826
00:54:43,584 --> 00:54:45,485
U-boat approaching.
Starboard side, sir.

827
00:54:45,553 --> 00:54:47,487
Battle stations!

828
00:54:47,555 --> 00:54:49,891
Major, if you know
what's good for you,

829
00:54:49,924 --> 00:54:52,560
- you'll head home.
- Very good, Commander.

830
00:54:52,593 --> 00:54:53,761
Haysey, get us away
from that torpedo magnet

831
00:54:53,795 --> 00:54:54,829
as quickly as possible.

832
00:54:54,896 --> 00:54:57,397
Aye, sir. Apple, man the stern.

833
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:58,833
Freddy, on the main sail.

834
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,269
Lassen to the bow, now.
Untie that station!

835
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:02,570
Aye.

836
00:55:02,603 --> 00:55:04,939
Quickly now, lads!

837
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:07,440
Hoist that foresail for us,
will you, boys?

838
00:55:08,976 --> 00:55:10,511
Main sail ready to haul!

839
00:55:15,249 --> 00:55:17,185
All right, Freddy,
now raise that main sail!

840
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:18,451
Aye.

841
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:19,987
Report sounding.

842
00:55:20,054 --> 00:55:21,589
Bearing 163.

843
00:55:30,131 --> 00:55:31,364
Lassen, trim the main sail

844
00:55:31,431 --> 00:55:33,034
and then tie it off!

845
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,535
How do you expect good?

846
00:55:36,237 --> 00:55:37,305
Report sounding.

847
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:38,873
Bearing 115.

848
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,141
Fire depth charges.

849
00:56:14,474 --> 00:56:17,245
So, this is your man
that gets things done?

850
00:56:17,311 --> 00:56:20,314
His name is Kamp Billy...
with a K.

851
00:56:23,017 --> 00:56:24,886
And he went
to an English boarding school?

852
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:29,489
Not just any boarding school.
He went to Eton,

853
00:56:30,892 --> 00:56:32,360
the boarding school.

854
00:56:33,728 --> 00:56:34,762
Right...

855
00:56:38,498 --> 00:56:39,600
Then what's he doing here?

856
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,535
He's a prince.

857
00:56:41,569 --> 00:56:43,905
A prince of what, exactly?

858
00:56:43,971 --> 00:56:46,841
The Prince of Fernando Po!

859
00:56:46,874 --> 00:56:50,344
So, he's part pirate,
part aristocrat?

860
00:56:51,312 --> 00:56:53,014
Chic.

861
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:55,216
He's also
a part of our solution.

862
00:56:57,484 --> 00:56:58,686
RH.

863
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,855
KB.

864
00:57:01,389 --> 00:57:02,590
He's back in town.

865
00:57:02,657 --> 00:57:03,691
Chief.

866
00:57:11,766 --> 00:57:14,201
Seems like
you always come bearing gifts.

867
00:57:15,937 --> 00:57:17,605
Is she for me?

868
00:57:17,672 --> 00:57:19,407
Good luck with that.

869
00:57:20,274 --> 00:57:21,309
I'm not for you,

870
00:57:22,276 --> 00:57:23,744
but these are.

871
00:57:23,778 --> 00:57:26,213
Mmm. Goodies. Yummy.

872
00:57:29,016 --> 00:57:30,418
- Ade...
- Chief.

873
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:32,553
Come on, come on.

874
00:57:36,223 --> 00:57:37,758
Someone has taste.

875
00:57:38,726 --> 00:57:40,460
Rarer than hens' teeth.

876
00:57:40,528 --> 00:57:45,132
Well, RH tells me that KB

877
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:46,600
is the only man to talk to

878
00:57:46,634 --> 00:57:49,103
when it comes
to getting things done.

879
00:57:49,136 --> 00:57:50,905
Why do I feel like
I've gone from being

880
00:57:50,938 --> 00:57:53,574
the predator to the prey?

881
00:58:00,614 --> 00:58:02,650
Quite an entrance, young lady.

882
00:58:02,717 --> 00:58:04,585
It's on the condition
that we sample them...

883
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,754
now.

884
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:11,459
Ade, set the table.

885
00:58:11,491 --> 00:58:12,526
Chief.

886
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:14,862
And then the Duke said,

887
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:16,597
"Push it in till it stops!"

888
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:25,039
You are quite the weapon.

889
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:26,774
I was right,

890
00:58:27,608 --> 00:58:28,943
I was the prey.

891
00:58:31,946 --> 00:58:35,282
I'll help you
because I don't like Nazis.

892
00:58:35,316 --> 00:58:38,519
Not because they're Nazis
but because they're gauche.

893
00:58:38,552 --> 00:58:40,521
I'll give you a tug
and 12 of my best men,

894
00:58:40,588 --> 00:58:42,156
including yours truly.

895
00:58:43,624 --> 00:58:46,560
But if I'm gonna help you,
who's gonna help me?

896
00:58:46,627 --> 00:58:48,696
Because you're
not a soldier, RH.

897
00:58:49,697 --> 00:58:52,133
No, but she is.

898
00:58:55,136 --> 00:58:56,904
She'll outshoot your best man.

899
00:59:33,841 --> 00:59:34,875
I told you.

900
00:59:38,513 --> 00:59:39,947
- No!
- No!

901
00:59:42,149 --> 00:59:43,884
Stork delivery. Check.

902
00:59:44,919 --> 00:59:45,953
Check.

903
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,888
Twenty-three boys. Check.

904
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,624
Stork delivery.

905
00:59:53,094 --> 00:59:56,097
Twenty-three boys.

906
00:59:56,163 --> 00:59:59,233
Seventeen girls.

907
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:02,803
Meeting point 20 kilometers
outside Fernando Po.

908
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:05,106
The rendezvous with Heron.

909
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,475
Can you get us there?

910
01:00:07,542 --> 01:00:08,943
If the weather holds,

911
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,145
I can, sir.

912
01:00:28,362 --> 01:00:30,164
Twenty quid says
this doesn't end well.

913
01:00:31,031 --> 01:00:32,066
For who?

914
01:00:32,534 --> 01:00:33,934
For them.

915
01:00:33,968 --> 01:00:36,437
You can't bet on yourself,
Haysey. That's match-fixing.

916
01:00:38,405 --> 01:00:39,440
Let's do it.

917
01:00:40,609 --> 01:00:42,109
Heron, it's been too long.

918
01:00:42,143 --> 01:00:43,777
Good to see you, Gus.

919
01:00:43,811 --> 01:00:45,079
Apple.

920
01:00:46,615 --> 01:00:49,650
This is Kamp Billy,
the Prince of Fernando Po.

921
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:51,652
Your Highness.

922
01:00:51,886 --> 01:00:53,254
He's agreed to help us.

923
01:00:54,488 --> 01:00:56,790
Forgive me, but...

924
01:00:56,824 --> 01:01:00,761
I have a peculiar feeling
that we've met before.

925
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:04,298
I get that a lot.
I'm extremely well-traveled.

926
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:07,034
No, no.
It's a particular sense.

927
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:13,174
I don't suppose
you played cricket, did you?

928
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:17,878
Captained Eton. '21 to '22.

929
01:01:17,945 --> 01:01:20,347
I knew I knew your face!

930
01:01:20,414 --> 01:01:22,349
Right next
to the trophy cabinet.

931
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:25,152
An eight-foot-tall
huge portrait.

932
01:01:25,186 --> 01:01:27,888
Yes, exactly that!

933
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:29,190
One eye on the boundary...

934
01:01:29,256 --> 01:01:30,858
one eye on the pub.

935
01:01:30,925 --> 01:01:32,527
Bloody glad to have you aboard.

936
01:01:32,594 --> 01:01:34,195
Bloody good
to be here, old boy.

937
01:01:34,762 --> 01:01:36,363
I'm very bored

938
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:38,567
with these Nazis making
a nuisance of themselves.

939
01:01:38,633 --> 01:01:40,201
I mean,
it's terrible for business.

940
01:01:40,267 --> 01:01:41,869
I'm only too pleased

941
01:01:41,936 --> 01:01:45,005
to help you
serve them a bloody nose.

942
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:46,840
That's a commendable attitude.

943
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:48,876
So, what's your plan?

944
01:01:48,943 --> 01:01:49,977
Apple.

945
01:01:51,178 --> 01:01:52,279
We're going
to sink the <i>Duchessa,</i>

946
01:01:52,346 --> 01:01:53,881
plus the two tugs.

947
01:01:53,948 --> 01:01:56,217
Crippling Hitler's
Atlantic fleet of U-boats.

948
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,451
Very good.

949
01:01:57,519 --> 01:02:00,020
The thing is,
our old friends the Nazis

950
01:02:00,054 --> 01:02:01,590
aren't making it the easiest.

951
01:02:01,656 --> 01:02:03,592
We're outnumbered
two hundred to five.

952
01:02:03,658 --> 01:02:05,726
There's a few more soldiers
than we anticipated.

953
01:02:06,695 --> 01:02:07,861
I think that we're gonna have

954
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:10,097
to find ourselves
a few more strapping lads.

955
01:02:10,965 --> 01:02:11,966
Ade...

956
01:02:21,976 --> 01:02:23,511
Right...

957
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:28,849
Yes, I think that will do.

958
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:32,621
We brought some weapons
if you need.

959
01:02:32,687 --> 01:02:34,788
You hold onto those.
We brought our own.

960
01:02:37,491 --> 01:02:39,960
Oyah!
Show them the iron!

961
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:44,498
Marvelous.

962
01:02:44,532 --> 01:02:46,133
You do know
the <i>Duchessa</i> is

963
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,637
more than 200 feet
from the harbor side?

964
01:02:48,703 --> 01:02:51,338
And she's in full glare
of the lights.

965
01:02:51,405 --> 01:02:53,073
She's not gonna be easy to sink

966
01:02:53,107 --> 01:02:55,142
without attracting
unwanted attention.

967
01:02:55,209 --> 01:02:58,613
Yes. That's why Heron
will plant a bomb

968
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,914
to blow the lights,
before we paddle in

969
01:03:00,948 --> 01:03:03,817
and rig the hull
with explosives.

970
01:03:03,884 --> 01:03:06,120
By the time
the explosives detonate,

971
01:03:06,186 --> 01:03:07,354
we'll be heading home.

972
01:03:07,421 --> 01:03:09,490
If I had it my way,
a shot'll never be fired.

973
01:03:09,557 --> 01:03:12,359
And how often
do you have it your way?

974
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:14,161
Depends on who you ask, old boy.

975
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:17,599
Gentlemen...

976
01:03:17,632 --> 01:03:18,966
- Ade.
- Chief.

977
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:21,035
Prepare the men.

978
01:03:21,101 --> 01:03:23,270
I'll take that 20
whenever you're ready, Freddy.

979
01:03:41,756 --> 01:03:43,658
The <i>Duchessa</i>
will be gone by the morning.

980
01:03:44,759 --> 01:03:46,260
Can you manage that?

981
01:03:48,128 --> 01:03:50,598
It's two wires and a tick-tock.

982
01:03:51,832 --> 01:03:53,367
I'm sure I can cope.

983
01:03:54,968 --> 01:03:57,104
It's not me you should be
worried about.

984
01:03:59,574 --> 01:04:01,676
I've never
taken a Nazi to a party.

985
01:04:04,512 --> 01:04:07,448
Just don't end up
at one of his parties.

986
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,721
Don't worry about me.

987
01:04:13,822 --> 01:04:15,889
I'm gonna have
my own little party.

988
01:04:20,961 --> 01:04:23,063
Drink for the boys,
on His Majesty's government.

989
01:04:27,802 --> 01:04:30,739
Ordinarily,
I'd bite your hand off,

990
01:04:30,805 --> 01:04:33,006
as I have been known
to love a pound note.

991
01:04:36,944 --> 01:04:38,145
But on this occasion,

992
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,816
the drinks are on me.

993
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:44,284
However,

994
01:04:44,351 --> 01:04:46,887
if His Majesty's government
was handing out titles...

995
01:04:47,789 --> 01:04:49,758
You're already a prince,
old boy.

996
01:04:49,824 --> 01:04:53,060
There's Prince
of Fernando Po, but...

997
01:04:53,127 --> 01:04:56,163
a Knight of the Realm
has a certain antiquity to it.

998
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:01,068
Arise, Sir Kamp Billy.

999
01:05:03,237 --> 01:05:04,773
You're a good man, Gus.

1000
01:05:05,707 --> 01:05:06,741
Good luck, Billy.

1001
01:05:17,351 --> 01:05:18,553
<i>Hola!</i>

1002
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,955
<i>Buenas tardes, companeros!</i>

1003
01:06:21,081 --> 01:06:22,349
What are you doing here?

1004
01:06:59,152 --> 01:07:00,989
My <i>Herr,</i> you have a visitor.

1005
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:05,660
Ta-da!

1006
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:12,800
Cleopatra needs her Caesar.

1007
01:07:13,433 --> 01:07:14,468
Put it on.

1008
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:19,239
Thank you, Timothy.

1009
01:07:20,008 --> 01:07:21,141
One second.

1010
01:07:21,676 --> 01:07:22,710
Timothy...

1011
01:07:24,546 --> 01:07:26,246
I have a counter offer.

1012
01:07:26,313 --> 01:07:28,550
Let's put
this dressing up aside.

1013
01:07:28,616 --> 01:07:31,519
It's for children.
And we are not children.

1014
01:07:34,556 --> 01:07:36,189
Let's make our own party.

1015
01:07:37,157 --> 01:07:38,526
A dark party.

1016
01:07:39,493 --> 01:07:42,530
A dark Nazi party.

1017
01:07:42,564 --> 01:07:47,167
With music, lubrication
and a handsome Nazi.

1018
01:07:48,302 --> 01:07:49,604
Since I've been here,

1019
01:07:49,671 --> 01:07:52,774
I've been bitten by things
that croak and slither,

1020
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,043
scorpions nest in my boots
and I can't sleep

1021
01:07:55,075 --> 01:07:57,277
for the relentless howl
of jungle entropy.

1022
01:07:57,845 --> 01:07:59,047
Tonight,

1023
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:03,283
I'm going to that party,
and you are taking me.

1024
01:08:04,886 --> 01:08:07,120
Now, put it on.

1025
01:08:08,255 --> 01:08:09,289
Oh.

1026
01:08:10,357 --> 01:08:11,793
Very well.

1027
01:08:51,933 --> 01:08:53,500
Ah! <i>Hola!</i>

1028
01:09:07,749 --> 01:09:09,817
We move when the lights go out.

1029
01:09:27,434 --> 01:09:29,103
All right, Ricardo,

1030
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:33,041
today you're <i>El Capitan.</i>

1031
01:09:33,107 --> 01:09:36,476
Armando, the bar is yours.

1032
01:09:36,511 --> 01:09:38,680
Use it. Abuse it at your will.

1033
01:09:38,746 --> 01:09:41,516
That's why I love you.

1034
01:09:41,582 --> 01:09:43,350
Come with me, handsome.

1035
01:09:47,254 --> 01:09:49,189
I need you
to keep the men happy.

1036
01:09:51,592 --> 01:09:52,627
How happy?

1037
01:10:11,145 --> 01:10:12,180
Mmm.

1038
01:10:14,782 --> 01:10:17,185
Are the rats in the nest?

1039
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:20,888
You won't find a German,
Spanish or Italian officer

1040
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:22,222
anywhere else tonight.

1041
01:10:28,062 --> 01:10:29,564
Between the beer fest
at the harbor

1042
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:31,364
and this little get-together,

1043
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:33,868
that'll be 90% of the soldiers
away from the dock.

1044
01:10:35,302 --> 01:10:37,270
The charge is set
to blow the harbor lights

1045
01:10:37,337 --> 01:10:38,371
in 30 minutes.

1046
01:10:39,974 --> 01:10:42,076
Can you keep him here that long?

1047
01:10:42,143 --> 01:10:45,079
Silly boy, silly question.
Look at the dress.

1048
01:10:55,422 --> 01:10:56,456
Hi.

1049
01:10:56,524 --> 01:10:58,659
So, you call this a party?

1050
01:10:58,726 --> 01:11:00,393
This is just
the thin end of the wedge.

1051
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:03,064
I've created a performance
just for you.

1052
01:11:03,097 --> 01:11:05,933
Well, I could show you
a real party.

1053
01:11:33,094 --> 01:11:34,662
Why do I care, Spaghetti?

1054
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:36,697
Pizza.

1055
01:11:36,764 --> 01:11:38,766
Excuse me
while I powder my nose.

1056
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,701
What, again?

1057
01:11:40,768 --> 01:11:43,271
Don't panic, Caesar.
Brush up on your Italian.

1058
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:45,773
Your gift needs to be wrapped.

1059
01:11:45,807 --> 01:11:47,708
Keep those officers
drinking, please.

1060
01:11:47,775 --> 01:11:49,744
- Of course. Okay.
- Thank you, Femi.

1061
01:11:49,777 --> 01:11:51,813
The <i>Duchessa's</i> hull
has been reinforced.

1062
01:11:52,647 --> 01:11:53,681
It won't sink.

1063
01:11:54,916 --> 01:11:56,150
We need to stop the mission.

1064
01:12:02,723 --> 01:12:04,192
That's going to be hard to do.

1065
01:12:04,258 --> 01:12:05,726
Listen to me.

1066
01:12:05,793 --> 01:12:07,195
Our mission will fail.

1067
01:12:07,261 --> 01:12:08,428
The explosives won't work

1068
01:12:08,461 --> 01:12:11,165
because he's reinforced it
to be unsinkable.

1069
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:13,868
You have to stop them now.

1070
01:12:16,737 --> 01:12:19,640
But the charge is about
to blow the lights.

1071
01:12:21,676 --> 01:12:22,910
Well, if you can't
stop the lights,

1072
01:12:22,977 --> 01:12:24,011
stop the men.

1073
01:12:24,078 --> 01:12:25,880
Luhr must not leave this party.

1074
01:12:26,747 --> 01:12:28,816
I'll keep him busy. Go, now.

1075
01:13:08,289 --> 01:13:09,924
And we're off.

1076
01:13:09,991 --> 01:13:11,225
Gus, wait.

1077
01:13:30,845 --> 01:13:33,514
Stork to Maid,
Stork to Maid, come in.

1078
01:13:34,682 --> 01:13:35,883
Channel five.

1079
01:13:35,917 --> 01:13:37,251
<i>This is Maid. Switching to 20.</i>

1080
01:13:40,321 --> 01:13:41,789
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1081
01:13:41,856 --> 01:13:44,091
Tin of corned beef
can't be cracked.

1082
01:13:44,825 --> 01:13:46,560
<i>The ship cannot be sunk.</i>

1083
01:13:47,328 --> 01:13:49,063
<i>Explosives will fail.</i>

1084
01:13:50,097 --> 01:13:51,565
It's Stork, sir.

1085
01:13:51,599 --> 01:13:52,767
Put him on open speaker.

1086
01:13:53,868 --> 01:13:55,870
<i>Corned beef
can't be cracked.</i>

1087
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:57,605
Stork, this is M.

1088
01:13:57,672 --> 01:13:59,674
Never mind the corned beef.
Just find a way.

1089
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:01,809
- Over.
- Pound incoming, sir.

1090
01:14:01,842 --> 01:14:03,244
<i>- Repeat...</i>
- Switch that off.

1091
01:14:03,277 --> 01:14:04,444
<i>We must...</i>

1092
01:14:06,013 --> 01:14:08,182
Stop this immediately.

1093
01:14:08,249 --> 01:14:11,018
What you are doing ends now,

1094
01:14:11,085 --> 01:14:13,453
or every last one of you
will be subject to a tribunal.

1095
01:14:13,521 --> 01:14:15,122
Is that clear?

1096
01:14:15,189 --> 01:14:17,558
I don't know what
you're talking about, sir.

1097
01:14:18,693 --> 01:14:21,395
Is that correct, Sergeant?

1098
01:14:24,932 --> 01:14:26,334
<i>Hold position.</i>

1099
01:14:26,367 --> 01:14:28,536
<i>How long, Stork?</i>

1100
01:14:28,569 --> 01:14:29,637
<i>- Awaiting orders.</i>
- Give me that.

1101
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:30,738
<i>Stand by.</i>

1102
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:32,940
March-Phillips,

1103
01:14:32,974 --> 01:14:35,843
this is Admiral Pound
giving you a direct order.

1104
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:37,611
Abort this mission now.

1105
01:14:37,645 --> 01:14:38,779
<i>I will make sure that</i>

1106
01:14:38,813 --> 01:14:40,715
<i>none of you see
the light of day again.</i>

1107
01:14:40,748 --> 01:14:42,083
<i>You will spend
the rest of your lives</i>

1108
01:14:42,116 --> 01:14:44,018
<i>locked up
at His Majesty's pleasure.</i>

1109
01:14:44,051 --> 01:14:45,119
<i>That includes all of you.</i>

1110
01:14:45,152 --> 01:14:46,787
<i>Geoffrey Appleyard,</i>

1111
01:14:46,821 --> 01:14:47,922
<i>Anders Lassen,</i>

1112
01:14:47,955 --> 01:14:49,123
<i>- Freddy Buzz...</i>
- I'm sorry...

1113
01:14:49,156 --> 01:14:50,291
<i>and Henry Hayes.</i>

1114
01:14:50,324 --> 01:14:51,525
Can't quite make out

1115
01:14:51,592 --> 01:14:52,860
what you're saying.

1116
01:14:54,261 --> 01:14:55,730
Bye.

1117
01:14:55,796 --> 01:14:57,164
Is... Is that clear?

1118
01:14:57,198 --> 01:14:58,699
<i>Sorry? What?</i>

1119
01:14:58,733 --> 01:15:00,601
<i>I can't...
I can't quite hear you.</i>

1120
01:15:01,702 --> 01:15:03,471
<i>Please... fuck off.</i>

1121
01:15:08,476 --> 01:15:11,012
You and your operation
are reckless, Brigadier.

1122
01:15:12,013 --> 01:15:13,848
I will personally
advise parliament

1123
01:15:13,881 --> 01:15:17,018
to have the Prime Minister
removed from office.

1124
01:15:17,084 --> 01:15:18,986
And I am going to shut you down.

1125
01:15:20,321 --> 01:15:23,190
Message received
loud and clear, sir.

1126
01:15:29,697 --> 01:15:32,533
I suggest you also
fuck off, Sergeant.

1127
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,402
Fleming, contact March-Phillips.

1128
01:15:38,639 --> 01:15:40,141
Lily, get me
the Prime Minister on hotline.

1129
01:15:40,174 --> 01:15:41,575
<i>- Right away, sir.</i>
- Come in, 01.

1130
01:15:41,642 --> 01:15:42,910
Come in, do you receive?

1131
01:15:47,948 --> 01:15:49,583
- Yes?
<i>- Prime Minister,</i>

1132
01:15:49,617 --> 01:15:51,419
<i>I'm afraid
we've been discovered.</i>

1133
01:15:54,055 --> 01:15:55,556
There was a mole in our midst

1134
01:15:55,623 --> 01:15:56,757
and Admiral Pound

1135
01:15:56,824 --> 01:15:58,459
has ordered the mission
to be aborted.

1136
01:15:58,492 --> 01:16:01,328
<i>He wants to have parliament
remove you from office.</i>

1137
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:03,697
The mission must continue.

1138
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:05,232
01, this is base. Over.

1139
01:16:05,266 --> 01:16:06,700
<i>Tell Pound
if he has a problem,</i>

1140
01:16:06,734 --> 01:16:08,803
<i>to take it up with me.
He knows where I live.</i>

1141
01:16:08,836 --> 01:16:10,604
<i>Tell the men to press on.</i>

1142
01:16:10,671 --> 01:16:13,074
I'm afraid we've lost
all communication, sir.

1143
01:16:16,545 --> 01:16:17,945
There must be
something that we can do.

1144
01:16:18,012 --> 01:16:20,915
The only thing
I can do is remind you,

1145
01:16:20,981 --> 01:16:23,050
the reason
we chose March-Phillips

1146
01:16:23,084 --> 01:16:25,753
<i>is because
he doesn't follow orders.</i>

1147
01:16:28,557 --> 01:16:30,191
Then let's hope we chose well.

1148
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:37,765
The <i>Duchessa's</i> hull
has been reinforced.

1149
01:16:37,832 --> 01:16:39,733
Which means she can't be sunk.

1150
01:16:39,767 --> 01:16:43,003
At least not with the amount
of explosives we're carrying.

1151
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:45,272
Just wondering how and when
exactly this took place.

1152
01:16:45,339 --> 01:16:47,174
It's not important
how and when, it's happened.

1153
01:16:47,241 --> 01:16:49,410
Well, it is
kind of important, Gus.

1154
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:51,312
I don't care
about the prison time,

1155
01:16:51,378 --> 01:16:53,414
but I do care about finishing
what we've started.

1156
01:16:53,447 --> 01:16:54,715
Thank you, Freddy.

1157
01:16:54,748 --> 01:16:55,816
There must be
some sort of mistake.

1158
01:16:55,883 --> 01:16:56,917
You can't just reinforce...

1159
01:16:56,951 --> 01:16:58,786
There's no mistake, Haysey.

1160
01:16:58,853 --> 01:17:00,589
I'm just lost about
how and when exactly...

1161
01:17:00,621 --> 01:17:01,989
Enough!

1162
01:17:10,464 --> 01:17:11,999
Why don't we sink the tug boats?

1163
01:17:13,234 --> 01:17:14,969
Get rid of the shuttle
to the U-boats.

1164
01:17:16,203 --> 01:17:17,805
It's not enough.

1165
01:17:17,872 --> 01:17:19,073
They'll replace them in a week.

1166
01:17:29,216 --> 01:17:30,317
Why don't we steal them?

1167
01:17:30,384 --> 01:17:31,620
We can use Billy's boat

1168
01:17:31,652 --> 01:17:33,287
to drag the <i>Duchessa</i>
out of the harbor

1169
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,955
and steal the other two
German tug boats

1170
01:17:34,989 --> 01:17:36,223
that service the U-boats.

1171
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:38,125
And how are
we supposed to do that?

1172
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:41,829
Not only is she double-plated,
weighing twice as much,

1173
01:17:41,896 --> 01:17:43,664
but you'd need a full crew
to move a ship that size.

1174
01:17:43,731 --> 01:17:45,266
The tug boats are the crew.

1175
01:17:45,299 --> 01:17:47,201
We tow the <i>Duchessa</i>
out to the ocean

1176
01:17:48,135 --> 01:17:50,471
and, well, steal the lot.

1177
01:17:50,504 --> 01:17:53,174
Then what?
We still can't sink them.

1178
01:17:54,275 --> 01:17:55,544
We don't need to.

1179
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:57,044
We sail
into international waters

1180
01:17:57,111 --> 01:17:58,679
and hand everything
over to the Navy.

1181
01:17:58,746 --> 01:17:59,980
They're following us anyway,

1182
01:18:00,014 --> 01:18:01,315
so they'll be more than happy
to see us again.

1183
01:18:01,348 --> 01:18:02,950
And what about the anchor?

1184
01:18:04,018 --> 01:18:05,186
Have you seen the size of it?

1185
01:18:05,252 --> 01:18:07,087
If we're gonna
actually start to move her,

1186
01:18:07,154 --> 01:18:09,356
their S-boats
will catch us in seconds.

1187
01:18:09,423 --> 01:18:10,625
Well, what are you going to do

1188
01:18:10,659 --> 01:18:11,959
with all the explosives
you brought, Freddy?

1189
01:18:13,727 --> 01:18:15,630
We'll use them
to blow the anchor.

1190
01:18:15,664 --> 01:18:17,932
We'll rig the S-boats
so they can't follow,

1191
01:18:17,998 --> 01:18:20,267
rig the fuel reserve
that supplies the U-boats,

1192
01:18:20,334 --> 01:18:23,871
and then, well, blow the lot up.

1193
01:18:23,938 --> 01:18:25,406
That fuel explosion's
gonna bring

1194
01:18:25,472 --> 01:18:27,074
everyone and their mother
down to the harbor.

1195
01:18:27,141 --> 01:18:28,643
We set the fuse,

1196
01:18:28,677 --> 01:18:31,412
so that the fuel dump blows
once we're outside the harbor.

1197
01:18:31,478 --> 01:18:34,014
Then we sneak out quietly.

1198
01:18:35,517 --> 01:18:36,551
Not bad.

1199
01:18:38,052 --> 01:18:39,920
It's very greedy.

1200
01:18:41,623 --> 01:18:44,091
- Well, I'm in.
- Well,

1201
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:47,529
I'm not leaving until I have
a barrel full of Nazi hearts.

1202
01:18:47,562 --> 01:18:49,830
I'll do whatever
you tell me to do, sir.

1203
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:53,434
Gentlemen,

1204
01:18:58,506 --> 01:19:00,107
let's steal some boats.

1205
01:19:09,216 --> 01:19:12,554
Turns out she's double-plated,
so change of plans.

1206
01:19:14,221 --> 01:19:16,123
We're going
to steal the boats instead.

1207
01:19:19,093 --> 01:19:20,528
Is that even possible?

1208
01:19:22,196 --> 01:19:23,598
I'm not entirely sure.

1209
01:19:26,367 --> 01:19:28,035
But if you're up for it,
so are we.

1210
01:19:29,036 --> 01:19:30,304
And you know what that means.

1211
01:19:31,506 --> 01:19:34,108
A lot more blood
and a lot more sweat.

1212
01:19:34,174 --> 01:19:36,076
Hopefully not any of ours,
old boy.

1213
01:19:38,045 --> 01:19:40,214
I don't think we can do this
without you, Billy.

1214
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:52,092
Well, I'm up for it if you are.

1215
01:19:54,094 --> 01:19:55,530
I think we're gonna
need your tug.

1216
01:19:58,465 --> 01:20:00,635
Haysey and I will
take a stroll along the harbor

1217
01:20:00,702 --> 01:20:03,538
and take out
any soldiers still patrolling.

1218
01:20:03,605 --> 01:20:05,139
Freddy will bring
his dinghy around

1219
01:20:05,205 --> 01:20:06,340
and take care of the S-boats.

1220
01:20:06,407 --> 01:20:07,841
We'll meet you by the tug boats.

1221
01:20:09,109 --> 01:20:10,545
And the <i>Duchessa?</i>

1222
01:20:10,612 --> 01:20:12,012
That's Apple and me.

1223
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:14,448
We'll take care of any crew
and blow the anchor.

1224
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:16,016
And destroy their comms.

1225
01:20:17,752 --> 01:20:19,788
Not sure
what you'll meet on board.

1226
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:22,389
Take my top boy
and two more of my men.

1227
01:20:24,258 --> 01:20:26,327
Gentlemen, let's prepare.

1248
01:22:46,366 --> 01:22:47,836

01:22:51,038 --> 01:22:52,072
<i>Mein Herr.</i>

1250
01:22:58,746 --> 01:22:59,914
Haysey...

1251
01:23:47,662 --> 01:23:48,863
Up there
on the left, sir.

1252
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:50,330
Yes.

1253
01:23:53,701 --> 01:23:54,736
He made a crash!

1254
01:24:09,584 --> 01:24:12,252
We could take that car, sir.
Save us some shoe leather.

1255
01:24:46,588 --> 01:24:49,089
<i>♪ Look out, old Macky is back ♪</i>

1256
01:25:11,211 --> 01:25:12,279
Incoming.

1257
01:25:26,594 --> 01:25:28,663
Papers please.

1258
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:30,698
- Commander.
- All good, Freddy?

1259
01:25:30,765 --> 01:25:31,799
Charges are set to go

1260
01:25:31,866 --> 01:25:32,967
once we're out
of the harbor, sir.

1261
01:25:34,736 --> 01:25:36,169
Let's carry on then.

1262
01:25:51,418 --> 01:25:52,954
Did you enjoy your gift?

1263
01:25:53,788 --> 01:25:54,822
Mmm.

1264
01:25:57,058 --> 01:25:59,861
I think now it's time

1265
01:25:59,927 --> 01:26:04,098
that the fox shows his den
to the vixen.

1266
01:26:38,432 --> 01:26:40,835
Heron, why are
the lights still on?

1267
01:26:42,136 --> 01:26:43,503
I lit the room with oil lamps,

1268
01:26:43,538 --> 01:26:45,472
so they wouldn't notice
when the power went out.

1269
01:27:27,749 --> 01:27:29,382
Look out!

1270
01:27:47,101 --> 01:27:48,435
Freddy, rig this 88,

1271
01:27:48,502 --> 01:27:50,204
then take the first tug
with Haysey.

1272
01:27:53,674 --> 01:27:55,743
<i>- Gute nacht.
- Guten abend.</i>

1273
01:28:00,848 --> 01:28:02,016
<i>Guten abend.</i>

1274
01:28:28,209 --> 01:28:29,342
Terribly sorry, old boy.

1275
01:28:29,409 --> 01:28:30,778
Do you mind? I seem to...

1276
01:28:30,812 --> 01:28:33,281
have misplaced my knife.

1277
01:29:37,612 --> 01:29:39,213
Bugger!

1278
01:29:46,486 --> 01:29:47,521
Thank you, Billy.

1279
01:29:56,030 --> 01:29:57,899
Oh!

1280
01:30:54,255 --> 01:30:55,990
I hope that's
not your blood, Lassen.

1281
01:30:57,058 --> 01:30:58,592
I hope so too.

1282
01:31:05,132 --> 01:31:06,567
Okay, boys, cast off.

1283
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,835
Let's get this ship out of here.

1284
01:31:15,609 --> 01:31:19,146
Go on. Go on...

1285
01:31:19,714 --> 01:31:21,082
Go on!

1286
01:31:24,785 --> 01:31:27,455
There's three
more rooms just like this one.

1287
01:31:27,487 --> 01:31:29,991
That should stop the U-boats
for the next six months.

1288
01:31:31,659 --> 01:31:32,960
Let's get this thing
towed out of here.

1289
01:31:32,994 --> 01:31:34,729
We are here, boys.

1290
01:31:34,795 --> 01:31:36,630
Quietly. Let's set a warning.

1291
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:43,738
I need you to go
to the front of the boat

1292
01:31:43,771 --> 01:31:45,673
and attach the <i>Vulcan</i>
to the <i>Duchessa,</i>

1293
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:46,907
Lassen and I
will head to the bridge.

1294
01:31:46,974 --> 01:31:49,010
Okay.

1295
01:31:50,478 --> 01:31:52,313
Take the right side.

1296
01:31:52,346 --> 01:31:54,215
And you, get up there
and get this thing started.

1297
01:32:06,861 --> 01:32:07,895
It's Gus.

1298
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:10,531
Everyone's in place.

1299
01:32:13,367 --> 01:32:14,668
What,

1300
01:32:14,702 --> 01:32:16,670
you didn't actually think
it would work, did you?

1301
01:32:17,671 --> 01:32:18,806
It was your plan.

1302
01:32:19,707 --> 01:32:20,741
Well, let's make sure

1303
01:32:20,808 --> 01:32:22,643
we keep our end of the bargain.

1304
01:32:22,676 --> 01:32:24,245
Signal back and I'll heave off.

1305
01:32:26,781 --> 01:32:28,517
So, what happens now?

1306
01:32:28,549 --> 01:32:30,251
We wait for
the anchor chain to blow.

1307
01:32:30,317 --> 01:32:31,919
When do
we expect that to happen?

1308
01:32:31,986 --> 01:32:33,954
Shortly, I hope.

1309
01:32:34,021 --> 01:32:36,190
And then we're free to take her.

1310
01:32:36,223 --> 01:32:40,795
However, the real race begins
once the fuel depot goes.

1311
01:32:40,861 --> 01:32:43,264
Then we'll have every soldier
on the island turning up.

1312
01:32:45,232 --> 01:32:47,735
We don't wanna
be around to witness that.

1313
01:32:48,969 --> 01:32:50,204
How long was that fuse

1314
01:32:50,237 --> 01:32:51,705
you attached
to the anchor chain?

1315
01:32:52,873 --> 01:32:54,075
We'll find out soon enough.

1316
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:57,111
Wait for it,
you're gonna catch the rope.

1317
01:33:08,523 --> 01:33:09,558
Come on.

1318
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:30,878
First domino falls.

1319
01:33:32,613 --> 01:33:34,148
- Hitch up the other line.
- Yes, boss.

1320
01:33:34,215 --> 01:33:35,249
Pick up the slack.

1321
01:33:37,284 --> 01:33:39,787
They need to move her
before the fuel dump blows.

1322
01:33:41,055 --> 01:33:42,623
Heron, we need Marjorie.

1323
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:44,658
Leave Marjorie to me.

1324
01:33:44,725 --> 01:33:46,060
We'll catch you up.

1325
01:33:46,927 --> 01:33:47,962
Very good.

1326
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:49,763
Let's go!

1327
01:34:34,074 --> 01:34:35,876
I have to say, <i>Fraulein,</i>

1328
01:34:38,412 --> 01:34:39,446
you were good.

1329
01:34:40,781 --> 01:34:42,449
And you were sly.

1330
01:34:43,618 --> 01:34:45,386
There are only
two types of people

1331
01:34:45,452 --> 01:34:47,656
that are as sly as the fox.

1332
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:49,624
The German

1333
01:34:51,025 --> 01:34:52,293
and the Jew.

1334
01:34:55,362 --> 01:34:59,366
And you are not German.

1335
01:35:00,501 --> 01:35:02,203
I think now it's time...

1336
01:35:04,138 --> 01:35:06,207
for a real party.

1337
01:35:16,817 --> 01:35:18,919
That wasn't
supposed to happen yet.

1338
01:35:23,692 --> 01:35:25,025
Shackle her!

1339
01:35:25,726 --> 01:35:26,760
And follow me.

1340
01:35:30,397 --> 01:35:31,865
The harbor is under attack!

1341
01:35:52,319 --> 01:35:53,354
They're coming.

1342
01:35:58,425 --> 01:35:59,860
We need power on the engine.

1343
01:36:04,164 --> 01:36:06,601
- She's too heavy!
- Pick up the slack!

1344
01:36:18,245 --> 01:36:19,780
Wait...

1345
01:36:23,917 --> 01:36:24,952
She's not moving!

1346
01:36:26,521 --> 01:36:28,989
Fire! Fire! Fire!

1347
01:36:29,056 --> 01:36:30,157
Wait for it.

1348
01:36:51,078 --> 01:36:52,913
We need
more power on the engine.

1349
01:36:52,946 --> 01:36:55,316
Give me more power! More power!

1350
01:36:56,917 --> 01:36:58,419
That's it, it's working!

1351
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:00,522
That's it!

1352
01:37:27,682 --> 01:37:28,882
Ready!

1353
01:37:50,204 --> 01:37:51,872
Haysey!

1354
01:38:51,599 --> 01:38:53,535
We're out of range now.

1355
01:38:55,269 --> 01:38:56,671
I'm no expert.

1356
01:38:56,738 --> 01:38:59,507
But you've got a big old hole
in your shoulder, Haysey.

1357
01:39:47,387 --> 01:39:49,089
Captain,

1358
01:39:49,122 --> 01:39:51,526
would you explain to me
what's going on here?

1359
01:39:52,694 --> 01:39:54,696
The power is gone.

1360
01:39:54,762 --> 01:39:57,030
The fuel depot
has been sabotaged.

1361
01:39:57,097 --> 01:39:58,165
And no one knows
what's happening.

1362
01:39:58,232 --> 01:39:59,333
But this is your fault.

1363
01:39:59,399 --> 01:40:01,001
Where is my ship?

1364
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:04,238
The <i>Duchessa,</i> where did it go?

1365
01:40:04,304 --> 01:40:06,641
Someone's taken him
while you weren't looking.

1366
01:40:07,675 --> 01:40:09,009
You idiot!

1367
01:40:09,076 --> 01:40:10,645
You always have to say something

1368
01:40:10,678 --> 01:40:12,514
at the very wrong time.

1369
01:40:13,515 --> 01:40:16,450
There is never
a right time with you!

1370
01:40:17,284 --> 01:40:18,485
Your greed and perversion

1371
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:20,755
has distracted you
from your duties.

1372
01:40:20,822 --> 01:40:22,389
Now my harbor is destroyed.

1373
01:40:22,456 --> 01:40:24,124
And my ship is gone!

1374
01:40:27,595 --> 01:40:30,665
And now you're gone too.
Thank you.

1375
01:40:58,826 --> 01:40:59,861
Impressive.

1376
01:41:02,697 --> 01:41:03,998
Sounds like
your detonators worked.

1377
01:41:41,201 --> 01:41:43,103
<i>Chapeau, mademoiselle.</i>

1378
01:41:43,170 --> 01:41:46,774
You play well.
You really are the vixen.

1379
01:41:48,042 --> 01:41:49,077
Am I?

1380
01:41:50,878 --> 01:41:52,614
Well, my hand's been revealed.

1381
01:41:56,249 --> 01:41:58,653
So, what now?

1382
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:02,456
Now, I possess your hand

1383
01:42:02,523 --> 01:42:04,726
and for everything
you have done to me,

1384
01:42:05,893 --> 01:42:09,063
I will visit
a thousand fold upon you.

1385
01:42:16,738 --> 01:42:17,772
Yeah.

1386
01:42:25,079 --> 01:42:26,114
But no.

1387
01:42:39,627 --> 01:42:41,361
Lie down.

1388
01:42:44,999 --> 01:42:48,136
Gus, we can't wait much longer.

1389
01:42:51,405 --> 01:42:52,707
They're coming.

1390
01:42:52,774 --> 01:42:54,207
If we stay here,

1391
01:42:54,274 --> 01:42:56,309
we'll lose contact
with the others.

1392
01:42:56,343 --> 01:42:58,278
Hold fast, Billy.

1393
01:42:58,311 --> 01:43:01,015
Heron has a way of surviving
and Marjorie,

1394
01:43:01,082 --> 01:43:03,818
well... good luck with that.

1395
01:43:08,856 --> 01:43:10,892
That's a patrol boat
coming towards us.

1396
01:43:15,295 --> 01:43:17,165
Gus, we need to leave. Now.

1397
01:43:18,166 --> 01:43:19,499
Hold on...

1398
01:43:31,813 --> 01:43:32,847
It's them.

1399
01:43:34,182 --> 01:43:35,717
RH.

1400
01:43:36,617 --> 01:43:38,753
- KB.
- Marjorie.

1401
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:41,388
Overdressed and underdressed
at the same time.

1402
01:43:44,192 --> 01:43:45,993
Come on, let's get you
out of those shackles.

1403
01:43:51,699 --> 01:43:53,601
Come in, <i>Violet.</i>

1404
01:43:53,634 --> 01:43:55,169
Calling <i>H.M.S. Violet.</i>

1405
01:43:56,470 --> 01:43:57,672
{\an8}<i>Come in,</i> Violet.

1406
01:43:57,705 --> 01:43:59,140
<i>This is</i> Maid Honor.

1407
01:43:59,173 --> 01:44:00,340
Go ahead, <i>Maid Honor.</i>

1408
01:44:01,175 --> 01:44:02,944
Loudspeaker.

1409
01:44:02,977 --> 01:44:04,612
<i>Sorry to bother you
at this time of the night,</i>

1410
01:44:04,679 --> 01:44:06,346
but we've found ourselves
with one or two items

1411
01:44:06,379 --> 01:44:07,447
that might be
of interest to you.

1412
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:10,518
<i>Shall we rendezvous
for a handover?</i>

1413
01:44:11,986 --> 01:44:13,353
Get me Admiral Pound.

1414
01:44:23,197 --> 01:44:24,632
- Yes?
<i>- Sir,</i>

1415
01:44:24,665 --> 01:44:27,068
<i>- good news and bad news.</i>
- Yes, yes. Get to it.

1416
01:44:27,101 --> 01:44:28,870
<i>Bad news, they didn't sink her.</i>

1417
01:44:29,704 --> 01:44:30,772
<i>Good news,</i>

1418
01:44:31,371 --> 01:44:32,540
<i>they stole her.</i>

1419
01:44:33,941 --> 01:44:36,144
Congratulations, Prime Minister.

1420
01:45:04,304 --> 01:45:05,405
Hold it there!

1421
01:45:06,641 --> 01:45:07,675
Commander.

1422
01:45:07,742 --> 01:45:09,309
You were ordered
by Admiral Pound

1423
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,611
to cease activities.

1424
01:45:10,645 --> 01:45:12,445
You did not.

1425
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:14,048
Therefore, you are
to be returned to England

1426
01:45:14,115 --> 01:45:16,517
to face a tribunal. You.

1427
01:45:16,584 --> 01:45:19,854
Return to your tug
with the rest of your militia.

1428
01:45:19,921 --> 01:45:21,321
- Take them to the brig.
- Sir!

1429
01:45:21,388 --> 01:45:24,158
Good to see you too, Commander.

1430
01:45:24,225 --> 01:45:25,960
Separate cells.

1431
01:45:25,993 --> 01:45:27,995
Follow me!

1432
01:45:28,062 --> 01:45:29,697
Let's go! Let's get moving!

1433
01:45:31,398 --> 01:45:32,967
- RH.
- KB.

1434
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,035
Come on.

1435
01:45:35,402 --> 01:45:36,704
Go on, move.

1436
01:45:36,771 --> 01:45:37,805
One moment, seaman.

1437
01:45:42,076 --> 01:45:43,110
Billy.

1438
01:45:45,445 --> 01:45:46,547
One eye on the boundary...

1439
01:45:48,282 --> 01:45:49,449
One eye on the pub.

1440
01:45:51,451 --> 01:45:53,154
They'll thank you
for this one day.

1441
01:45:54,021 --> 01:45:55,323
I'm not sure

1442
01:45:55,355 --> 01:45:56,891
that's what we were
really looking for, was it,

1443
01:45:58,159 --> 01:45:59,193
Your Highness?

1444
01:46:01,128 --> 01:46:03,798
Shop's open
for you anytime, Major.

1445
01:46:14,508 --> 01:46:16,010
Sorry to intrude,
Prime Minister,

1446
01:46:16,043 --> 01:46:17,712
but M thought
you should see this.

1447
01:46:23,217 --> 01:46:24,252
Thank you, Gloria.

1448
01:46:34,461 --> 01:46:37,064
Line up. Face front!

1449
01:46:38,232 --> 01:46:40,868
Line up. Face front!

1450
01:46:40,902 --> 01:46:43,104
Line up. Face front!

1451
01:46:43,170 --> 01:46:44,437
No need to shout.

1452
01:46:47,575 --> 01:46:49,377
Stand still!

1453
01:46:49,409 --> 01:46:51,178
Any chance of a cup of tea?

1454
01:46:52,146 --> 01:46:53,446
You, back up to the wall.

1455
01:46:53,514 --> 01:46:54,849
Off the cloth, moth.

1456
01:46:56,017 --> 01:46:57,118
Stand straight!

1457
01:47:08,329 --> 01:47:10,497
Never before
have the senior Military

1458
01:47:10,564 --> 01:47:12,733
and Navy Commanders
of this country

1459
01:47:12,767 --> 01:47:14,702
been so united
in their condemnation.

1460
01:47:15,435 --> 01:47:16,938
It is their view

1461
01:47:17,004 --> 01:47:18,539
that the discipline

1462
01:47:18,572 --> 01:47:21,242
on which
our armed forces depends

1463
01:47:21,275 --> 01:47:24,245
has been undermined
by men serving no master

1464
01:47:24,278 --> 01:47:27,648
but their own thirst
for blood, murder and mayhem.

1465
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:31,118
Men who disobeyed a direct order

1466
01:47:31,185 --> 01:47:32,787
from the Admiral
of the fleet himself,

1467
01:47:34,622 --> 01:47:35,656
and chose instead

1468
01:47:36,590 --> 01:47:38,392
to trust the whim and intuition

1469
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:41,262
of the man standing beside him.

1470
01:47:43,030 --> 01:47:44,398
How dare they.

1471
01:47:46,767 --> 01:47:49,170
When only this morning,

1472
01:47:49,236 --> 01:47:52,606
the first American soldiers
arrived on British soil,

1473
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:54,041
ready to stand
shoulder to shoulder

1474
01:47:54,108 --> 01:47:55,142
with us in Europe.

1475
01:47:56,711 --> 01:47:59,080
Allies who risked death
crossing the North Atlantic,

1476
01:48:00,648 --> 01:48:02,583
and only by some miracle

1477
01:48:04,151 --> 01:48:07,955
found their crossing
untroubled by Nazi U-boats.

1478
01:48:10,124 --> 01:48:12,293
A happy circumstance,
I might add,

1479
01:48:13,561 --> 01:48:15,830
which cannot be accounted for,

1480
01:48:15,896 --> 01:48:18,498
but which has cleared the way
for the United States

1481
01:48:18,566 --> 01:48:20,500
to enter the European war.

1482
01:48:20,568 --> 01:48:22,069
And for which I know

1483
01:48:22,136 --> 01:48:26,107
President Roosevelt
to be immeasurably grateful.

1484
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:30,745
But setting aside

1485
01:48:30,811 --> 01:48:34,015
this stroke
of unexplained fortune,

1486
01:48:34,081 --> 01:48:37,318
what is to be done
with this unruly company

1487
01:48:37,351 --> 01:48:39,153
who do not obey orders?

1488
01:48:39,186 --> 01:48:40,454
Who seem to have formed

1489
01:48:40,488 --> 01:48:44,392
their own ministry
of ungentlemanly warfare.

1490
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:51,065
From now on, they work for me.
