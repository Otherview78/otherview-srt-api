1
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,344
Hey, how did you
open your cell door?

2
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:24,971
Hey!

3
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:26,055
What are you doing?

4
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:27,807
Open Sector 2!

5
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:31,394
How did you get out?

6
00:03:33,397 --> 00:03:34,730
Get back in your cell.

7
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,025
I told you, get
back in your cell!

8
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:40,611
Let's give you a few
friends to play with.

9
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:55,626
Sorry.

10
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,759
Send some guards in.

11
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:04,844
I'm trying.

12
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:13,436
Okay, I'm set. How's
things going down below?

13
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:15,354
How do you think?
I'm in a sewer.

14
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,648
The doors won't open!
We're locked in!

15
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:19,316
Sound the alarm!

16
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:29,035
We've lost control!

17
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:30,745
Captain!

18
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:47,970
I'm in position.

19
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:50,139
Move to phase 2.

20
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,611
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

21
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:47,530
What's wrong? What's
happening, Benji?

22
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,240
Oh, God. He's not going
to the extraction point.

23
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:51,534
Stay focused. He knows
where he's going.

24
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:02,044
No, I'm not. I won't. I
will not open that door.

25
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:05,381
Please go to the extraction
point, Ethan. I know.

26
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,217
I know what this means, but I can't.
I'm not authorized...

27
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,387
Go to the extraction
point, Ethan.

28
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:13,055
Go to the extraction point!

29
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,266
Oh, you're just going to wait.

30
00:06:15,392 --> 00:06:17,434
We're going to wait.
Great. I can wait.

31
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:29,572
Okay, fine. Fine! Fine!

32
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:31,115
There.

33
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,826
We'll just screw the whole
thing up on purpose.

34
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,418
Jane? We're going to
have a slight delay.

35
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,397
Why do you want to go in there?

36
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:13,032
Bogdan!

37
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:15,784
Sergei?

38
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:17,203
Time to go!

39
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:18,787
Now?

40
00:07:19,164 --> 00:07:20,164
Yes, now!

41
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:26,462
I don't know what he's doing, and
for some reason, I'm helping him.

42
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,881
As long as he's where he
should be when the song ends.

43
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,179
We have a passenger.

44
00:08:01,873 --> 00:08:02,998
Sergei!

45
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,177
Open all of them!

46
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,613
Oh God!

47
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:38,242
Oh God oh God oh God...

48
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,204
Sergei, please tell me
there's more to this plan!

49
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:22,077
Let's go...

50
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:23,495
Agent Hunt?

51
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,580
And you are?

52
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:26,332
Agent Carter.

53
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,167
Okay.

54
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:31,045
Who's your pal?

55
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:32,338
I'll tell you on the way!

56
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,135
Light the fuse.

57
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,964
Sergei, what's going on?

58
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:40,048
It's OK, Bogdan.

59
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,009
I don't mean to bring up
the elephant in the room,

60
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:43,886
but what's with the
big, hairy Russian?

61
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:47,222
Who, Bogdan? He fed me intel. If I left
him there, they would've killed him.

62
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,807
So we're gonna give
him his freedom.

63
00:11:48,892 --> 00:11:49,975
Did you call in the sweepers?

64
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:51,059
On their way.

65
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,895
Good, good.

66
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:56,982
Benji, how is it you're here?

67
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,109
Oh, I passed the field exam.

68
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:01,236
Crazy, right?

69
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:03,280
Yeah. Crazy.

70
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:04,990
- DNA test.
- It's me.

71
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,909
It's procedure. I'm just
confirming it's you.

72
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,827
- You're very thorough.
- Sergei?

73
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:10,245
Are you not Russian?

74
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,872
Relax.

75
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,416
Sweepers approaching!
Brooms are out!

76
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,001
- Roger that.
- Sergei.

77
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,463
Are you not Sergei?

78
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,677
You'll be fine.

79
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:27,012
Bogdan.

80
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:28,555
I always take care
of my friends.

81
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,599
My friend.

82
00:12:36,898 --> 00:12:38,357
Messy bringing him along.

83
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,025
I thought it went rather well.

84
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:42,110
Mind telling me what you were
doing in a Russian prison?

85
00:12:42,237 --> 00:12:44,071
Mind telling me why
you broke me out?

86
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:47,449
This wasn't a rescue mission?

87
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,076
Let me put it this way.

88
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,828
If the Secretary wanted
me out of there,

89
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:54,957
it must be pretty bad out here.

90
00:12:58,253 --> 00:12:59,753
We were after a file.

91
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:01,797
We lost it.

92
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:04,424
"We"? Who lost it? You?

93
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:11,139
Agent Hanaway.

94
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:12,849
Where's Hanaway?

95
00:13:22,986 --> 00:13:25,279
It was a letter drop.

96
00:13:25,363 --> 00:13:27,030
Classified file.

97
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:29,700
It should have been
a simple intercept.

98
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:40,002
We knew which train
the courier was on.

99
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,920
ETA, two minutes on the courier.

100
00:13:42,005 --> 00:13:43,463
But there was one
thing we didn't know.

101
00:13:43,548 --> 00:13:45,757
Bobcat, your train's
six minutes out.

102
00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:47,009
Who the courier was.

103
00:14:00,982 --> 00:14:02,441
It's now or never, Bobcat.

104
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:06,695
The courier delivering the
file, what's his name?

105
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,322
Go ahead. Shoot.

106
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,324
We are out of time.

107
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:19,499
I need a name, folks. I can't
track all these people at once.

108
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:24,171
Marek. Stefanski. For
the love of God!

109
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,297
You got it?

110
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:27,424
Marek Stefanski.

111
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:31,053
Searching.

112
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:46,276
I'll take it from here.

113
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,954
Hey, you all right, buddy?

114
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:00,165
Hanaway dropped the mark
and grabbed his bag.

115
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:02,751
Sit down. Catch your breath.

116
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:07,673
He had the file in his hands.
Easy in, easy out.

117
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,799
File secured.

118
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:13,387
But we weren't the
only ones after it.

119
00:15:13,471 --> 00:15:16,390
Bobcat, someone else has
crashed this party.

120
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:19,601
I'm not alone.

121
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:21,687
Local police?

122
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:23,980
No. Armed hostiles.

123
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,157
Hang tight, I'm coming!
Outrigger, back him up.

124
00:15:34,784 --> 00:15:36,076
Negative, Outrigger.

125
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,578
Rendezvous southwest
corner, 60 seconds.

126
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:43,709
Hanaway's lens cam drew a facial
match and triggered a warning.

127
00:15:46,838 --> 00:15:48,213
But it was too late.

128
00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:56,513
No!

129
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:02,811
You're going to be okay.

130
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:07,983
You're so beautiful.

131
00:16:09,777 --> 00:16:13,155
I'm sorry, I... I
should have told you.

132
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:19,494
It was my op.

133
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:22,998
I put him in the field.

134
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,877
And she left him just alive
enough for me to see him die.

135
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,687
I'm sorry.

136
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:50,025
You know her?

137
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:53,153
That's Sabine Moreau.
Contract killer.

138
00:16:54,197 --> 00:16:55,864
Works for diamonds.

139
00:16:57,074 --> 00:16:58,366
What was in the file?

140
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,502
Russian nuclear launch codes.

141
00:17:16,427 --> 00:17:20,180
IMF's been looking for an emerging
extremist, code name, Cobalt.

142
00:17:20,264 --> 00:17:23,391
He's determined to detonate a
nuclear weapon however he can.

143
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,644
We know Moreau's
worked for him before.

144
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:27,896
What else does IMF
know about him?

145
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:30,398
As much as you do now.

146
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:32,526
But if Moreau has
nuclear launch codes,

147
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,237
you can bet Cobalt's gone
from a person of interest

148
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,738
to enemy number one.

149
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,740
We're here.

150
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:03,598
Agent confirmed.

151
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:05,767
Why was he in prison?

152
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:10,564
He disappeared after he and his wife...
You know.

153
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:14,734
I thought he'd just been transferred.
Put on leave.

154
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:19,865
There were rumors, though.
Talk of an unsanctioned hit.

155
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:21,533
Welcome back, Mr. Hunt.

156
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:24,870
In your absence, IMF has
learned that Cobalt is or was

157
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:27,664
a level-1 nuclear strategist
for Russian intelligence.

158
00:18:27,748 --> 00:18:30,876
Therefore, the only way to
uncover his actual identity

159
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,253
is to infiltrate the
Kremlin itself.

160
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:35,714
In order to get past
their checkpoints,

161
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:38,717
you'll be impersonating
General Anatoly Fedorov.

162
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:40,760
We believe Cobalt will
do everything he can

163
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:42,846
to destroy any record
of his identity.

164
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,015
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,

165
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:48,226
is to penetrate the highly-secured
archive inside the Kremlin

166
00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:50,520
and retrieve Cobalt's file
before he can destroy it.

167
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:54,983
New intel suggests Cobalt is
already en route, leaving you...

168
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,652
4 hours 52 minutes...

169
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,029
to infiltrate.

170
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:01,781
To save time, we've
chosen your team for you.

171
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:03,241
Agents Carter and Dunn.

172
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:10,165
As always, should you or any member
of your team be caught or killed,

173
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,251
the Secretary will disavow any
knowledge of your actions.

174
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:15,837
This message will self-destruct
in five seconds.

175
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,172
Good luck, Ethan.

176
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:42,322
What do you got?

177
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:48,995
We're going into the Kremlin.

178
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:56,920
I thought you said
"The Kremlin."

179
00:19:59,382 --> 00:20:00,632
Okay.

180
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:40,088
This is very exciting.

181
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:43,049
Being out in the field.

182
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:44,884
With you, you know.

183
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:47,554
It's a bit of a dream for me.

184
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:53,184
Love your disguise, by the way.
You look just like him.

185
00:20:53,728 --> 00:20:57,564
It's a shame we're not wearing masks.
You know, like, full masks.

186
00:20:58,566 --> 00:21:01,067
Everybody gets to wear
a mask but Benji.

187
00:21:02,153 --> 00:21:03,153
Sorry.

188
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:05,030
I'm tense. I babble
when I'm nervous.

189
00:21:05,114 --> 00:21:07,073
I'm doing it again.
Shut up, Benji.

190
00:21:21,088 --> 00:21:22,672
Okay, seven security guards.

191
00:21:22,757 --> 00:21:25,383
X-ray machines. Cameras.
Metal detectors.

192
00:21:25,468 --> 00:21:27,635
Just what we expected.
We can do this.

193
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,935
Releasing in three, two, one.

194
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:45,779
Game face, game face.
Kremlin game face.

195
00:21:49,492 --> 00:21:50,992
General...

196
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:53,161
I am Major Egorov.

197
00:21:53,871 --> 00:21:55,163
Your documents.

198
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,714
You should know your boss.

199
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:31,533
I can't find you.

200
00:22:37,498 --> 00:22:38,790
Run it again...

201
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:39,999
Private.

202
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:41,626
Egorov.

203
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,639
Excuse me, General. I
didn't recognize you.

204
00:22:56,016 --> 00:22:58,518
You're going to
regret this, Egorov.

205
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:09,404
I think that went quite well.

206
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:10,572
Just shut it.

207
00:23:10,698 --> 00:23:11,698
Sorry.

208
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:37,116
It's going to work.

209
00:24:38,452 --> 00:24:42,121
I'm sorry, by the way.
About you and Julia.

210
00:24:43,624 --> 00:24:45,458
You know, not working out.

211
00:24:45,793 --> 00:24:49,212
I wanted to say something
before you went away, but...

212
00:24:49,296 --> 00:24:50,672
I liked her, you know.

213
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,466
He's off the phone now.

214
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:32,059
It's empty.

215
00:28:33,228 --> 00:28:34,604
The nest is empty.

216
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,828
Check in, Team Leader.

217
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:52,038
Over.

218
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:54,373
Repeat. Check in, Team Leader.

219
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,876
Have you made it to
the Archive Room?

220
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:58,836
Captain! The Archive Room!

221
00:28:59,087 --> 00:29:00,087
Run!

222
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:03,591
Someone is piggybacking
our frequency.

223
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:05,927
Team Leader,

224
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:09,847
awaiting your go-sign.
Standing by to detonate.

225
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:11,057
Abort.

226
00:29:14,728 --> 00:29:16,395
Rendezvous nine-two.

227
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,060
Shut the gate!

228
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:40,938
Quickly!

229
00:32:32,592 --> 00:32:34,260
Our media is no more
truthful than yours,

230
00:32:35,137 --> 00:32:36,595
American.

231
00:32:37,264 --> 00:32:40,933
But we both know that the
real cause of the explosion

232
00:32:41,268 --> 00:32:42,601
was you.

233
00:32:47,941 --> 00:32:50,067
Awaiting your
go-sign, Team Leader.

234
00:32:50,152 --> 00:32:52,153
Standing by to detonate.

235
00:32:53,113 --> 00:32:54,613
The worst part for you,

236
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:56,699
"Team Leader,"

237
00:32:57,534 --> 00:33:00,828
is I am the man assigned
to make you suffer for it.

238
00:33:01,288 --> 00:33:03,497
For what you did to my country.

239
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:08,335
This is a hospital...

240
00:33:08,837 --> 00:33:09,837
Not a night club.

241
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:11,839
Misha... help me here...

242
00:33:13,175 --> 00:33:14,175
Room twelve.

243
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,109
The doctors say he's
lucky to be alive.

244
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,615
Only a mild concussion.

245
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:39,700
I don't give a damn
about his health.

246
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,414
I have questions
that need answering.

247
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:48,876
Be careful!

248
00:33:50,837 --> 00:33:52,171
Prepare a transport.

249
00:33:57,761 --> 00:33:58,761
Check over there!

250
00:34:40,095 --> 00:34:41,762
Not a good idea.

251
00:34:43,223 --> 00:34:46,058
It seemed like one a minute ago.

252
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:42,990
All agents! Hot
target heading west!

253
00:36:02,302 --> 00:36:03,427
Consolidated Insurance.

254
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:04,553
How may I help you?

255
00:36:04,638 --> 00:36:08,599
SAT 20. Agent 82-Delta-Echo
requesting immediate evac.

256
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:11,226
Rendezvous Alpha 113.

257
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:14,146
Confirmed. Alpha 113.

258
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,464
Details surrounding the
intricate system of gas lines

259
00:36:40,548 --> 00:36:43,217
that run beneath the square
are still forthcoming,

260
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:46,303
but the majority of those lines
date back to the Soviet era

261
00:36:46,388 --> 00:36:48,597
and have not been
updated in at least...

262
00:36:49,015 --> 00:36:53,978
Anna... Anna... I've
been thinking...

263
00:36:55,063 --> 00:36:56,063
It looks like we...

264
00:37:00,735 --> 00:37:02,820
We should leave town
for a couple of days.

265
00:37:02,904 --> 00:37:05,531
Alex, you, me. Vacations.

266
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:07,866
- Now?
- Tonight.

267
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:09,827
Why are you speaking in English?

268
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,162
Just...

269
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:13,998
Just the three of us.

270
00:37:14,082 --> 00:37:17,835
May not have been an accident,
but a targeted attack.

271
00:37:19,212 --> 00:37:20,546
Preliminary numbers
are just starting...

272
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,964
Where will we go?

273
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,341
To come in regarding those
wounded in the blast.

274
00:37:24,426 --> 00:37:26,677
We can confirm that
11 tourists...

275
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:27,845
Leonid?

276
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:29,346
Their nationalities
still unconfirmed,

277
00:37:29,431 --> 00:37:32,766
have been transported to area
hospitals for treatment.

278
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:36,562
While Russian officials continue
to blame a gas-main break,

279
00:37:36,646 --> 00:37:41,025
experts are citing the shape of the blast
area and the size of the debris field

280
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:43,861
as more consistent with
that of a set explosive,

281
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:45,946
leading to speculation
that this may have been

282
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:48,282
an undeclared act of aggression.

283
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,534
Although the Defense
Ministry is maintaining

284
00:37:50,618 --> 00:37:51,952
that this is strictly
an accident...

285
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,747
Anna, pack a bag for Alex.

286
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,416
We're leaving now.

287
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:03,130
Anya!

288
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,977
We have work to do.

289
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:47,883
Mr. Secretary.

290
00:38:52,222 --> 00:38:53,555
I wasn't aware you
were in Russia.

291
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,226
I'm not. Not since a bomb
blew up the Kremlin.

292
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:04,399
Yesterday I flew in to accept
the Order of Friendship

293
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,026
from the Russian Prime Minister.

294
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:08,779
Now I'm headed
back to Washington

295
00:39:08,863 --> 00:39:11,532
to hand the President
my resignation.

296
00:39:14,536 --> 00:39:16,912
My Chief Analyst,
William Brandt.

297
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,790
Do you have a pen?

298
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:20,874
- Pardon me?
- A pen.

299
00:39:22,377 --> 00:39:23,502
Yeah.

300
00:39:25,672 --> 00:39:27,339
Ethan, what happened
in the Kremlin?

301
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:29,758
Chief Analyst, you say?

302
00:39:29,843 --> 00:39:31,635
If you're implying that
I made a bad call...

303
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:32,928
European male.

304
00:39:33,012 --> 00:39:36,306
Fifties. About six-foot, 180 pounds.
Blue eyes.

305
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:37,724
Who is he?

306
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:42,396
A crude drawing, but
by your description,

307
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,856
that could be Kurt Hendricks.

308
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,526
190 IQ. Served in
Swedish Special Forces.

309
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:50,529
Professor of physics,
Stockholm University.

310
00:39:50,613 --> 00:39:52,322
Specialist in nuclear
endgame theory.

311
00:39:52,407 --> 00:39:54,074
Asked to resign...

312
00:39:55,702 --> 00:39:57,369
Well, because he's crazy.

313
00:39:58,371 --> 00:39:59,371
Cobalt.

314
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:04,668
You have to alert the Kremlin
that one of their strategists

315
00:40:04,752 --> 00:40:06,170
has a nuclear launch device

316
00:40:06,588 --> 00:40:09,381
and one of his operatives has
the codes to activate it.

317
00:40:09,465 --> 00:40:10,716
And what makes you say that?

318
00:40:11,968 --> 00:40:12,968
I saw him

319
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:16,388
leaving the executive
armory, bag in hand.

320
00:40:16,472 --> 00:40:18,765
He set off that explosion
to cover his tracks.

321
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,976
It could be weeks before the
Russians know it's missing.

322
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,186
Unless we tell them.

323
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,812
They won't listen to us.

324
00:40:23,897 --> 00:40:27,858
As far as the Russians are concerned,
we just bombed the Kremlin.

325
00:40:28,484 --> 00:40:30,903
The tension between the
United States and Russia

326
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:33,989
hasn't been this high since
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

327
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:38,452
And the blame, right or
wrong, points to IMF.

328
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:46,835
The President has
initiated Ghost Protocol.

329
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,631
The entire IMF has
been disavowed.

330
00:40:53,635 --> 00:40:55,594
So what happens now?

331
00:40:55,678 --> 00:40:59,014
Now, I've been ordered to
take you back to Washington,

332
00:40:59,098 --> 00:41:02,142
where the DOD will label
you as a rogue extremist

333
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,853
and hang the Kremlin bombing
on you and your team.

334
00:41:05,855 --> 00:41:07,231
Unless,

335
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:09,566
you were to escape

336
00:41:09,651 --> 00:41:12,861
somewhere between
here and the airport,

337
00:41:12,946 --> 00:41:16,573
having assaulted Mr.
Brandt and me.

338
00:41:16,658 --> 00:41:17,658
Sir?

339
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,910
You would then

340
00:41:19,994 --> 00:41:21,954
illegally scrounge whatever
material you could

341
00:41:22,038 --> 00:41:24,581
from a backup supply cache
that I've overlooked.

342
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:28,001
The same cache where your team
are waiting for further orders.

343
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:29,086
Sir, you may want to...

344
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:33,966
You will then disappear, and this
conversation never having taken place,

345
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,718
your intentions
would be unclear.

346
00:41:36,803 --> 00:41:40,597
But if any one of your
team is caught or killed,

347
00:41:40,682 --> 00:41:42,808
they will be branded terrorists,

348
00:41:42,892 --> 00:41:46,395
out to incite
global nuclear war.

349
00:41:53,528 --> 00:41:54,611
Your mission,

350
00:41:55,822 --> 00:41:57,948
should you choose to accept it.

351
00:42:02,537 --> 00:42:04,788
Ethan, you were my best man.

352
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,833
And I'm sorry it's come to this,

353
00:42:07,917 --> 00:42:10,419
after all the
sacrifices you made.

354
00:42:12,714 --> 00:42:14,881
If we don't meet again, I
just want you to know,

355
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:17,551
I've always considered
you a friend.

356
00:42:19,887 --> 00:42:21,763
Stay down! Drive, drive, drive!

357
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:49,458
You okay?

358
00:42:49,584 --> 00:42:50,584
Yeah.

359
00:42:51,127 --> 00:42:53,837
Take a deep breath.
Stay with me.

360
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:55,213
- Ready?
- Yeah.

361
00:43:19,781 --> 00:43:21,114
What do we do?

362
00:43:22,617 --> 00:43:23,700
Wait here.

363
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:27,788
Where else am I going to go?

364
00:43:42,929 --> 00:43:44,679
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

365
00:43:58,486 --> 00:44:00,946
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

366
00:44:01,656 --> 00:44:05,033
Hold your fire!

367
00:44:05,284 --> 00:44:06,493
Weapons down!

368
00:44:08,162 --> 00:44:09,871
What are you firing at?

369
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:34,479
Two prisoners escaped
from Rankow Prison today.

370
00:44:42,363 --> 00:44:43,363
And this one?...

371
00:44:44,407 --> 00:44:45,949
What do we know about him?

372
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,246
Why would that work?

373
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,082
Why would what work?

374
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:56,293
The flare on the body,
why would that work?

375
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:57,544
It did work.

376
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,463
- Yeah, I know, but...
- Hey!

377
00:44:59,547 --> 00:45:03,800
But why? I mean, how did you
know that would draw their fire?

378
00:45:03,885 --> 00:45:06,052
I didn't. I played a hunch.

379
00:45:07,722 --> 00:45:11,057
Okay. All right, so
what was your scenario?

380
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:13,894
Right, you... There's a guy
being shot at in the water.

381
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:17,105
All of a sudden, decides to light
up a flare and swim around?

382
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:20,859
I mean, what did you
assume they'd be thinking?

383
00:45:20,943 --> 00:45:22,652
- Thinking?
- Yeah.

384
00:45:22,737 --> 00:45:25,614
I didn't assume
they were thinking.

385
00:45:25,698 --> 00:45:27,699
I assumed they were shooting
at anything that moved.

386
00:45:27,783 --> 00:45:30,160
I just gave them a target.
Look, these...

387
00:45:30,244 --> 00:45:33,038
These guys aren't Rhodes
Scholars, you know?

388
00:45:37,126 --> 00:45:38,752
It's really happening, isn't it?

389
00:45:39,587 --> 00:45:40,629
Yeah.

390
00:45:41,756 --> 00:45:43,215
Okay, you know what
that sound is?

391
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:45,133
That's our ride out of here!

392
00:45:45,218 --> 00:45:48,428
All right, it's a green car.
Number 47.

393
00:45:51,641 --> 00:45:53,183
I see green!

394
00:45:53,267 --> 00:45:54,851
Okay, let's do it.

395
00:45:54,936 --> 00:45:56,436
Go, go, go, go.

396
00:45:58,105 --> 00:46:00,232
All right, 47.

397
00:46:00,316 --> 00:46:01,566
I don't see it.

398
00:46:01,651 --> 00:46:03,109
47.

399
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:04,528
Oh, shit!

400
00:46:10,952 --> 00:46:13,036
This is it. The manifest.

401
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,704
Enter your code.

402
00:46:14,789 --> 00:46:15,789
Pole!

403
00:46:18,793 --> 00:46:19,960
Jeez...

404
00:46:21,504 --> 00:46:23,004
Press enter.

405
00:46:25,341 --> 00:46:26,716
Retinal scanner!

406
00:46:30,304 --> 00:46:32,556
Retinal scan required.

407
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,974
Watch out!

408
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:36,768
Retinal scan required.

409
00:46:36,852 --> 00:46:38,478
Agent confirmed.

410
00:46:52,034 --> 00:46:54,786
Ethan? Jeez, I thought
you were dead!

411
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,621
- We are.
- Who's this?

412
00:46:56,706 --> 00:47:00,083
Agents Dunn and Carter. William
Brandt, Chief Analyst.

413
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:01,501
Analyst?

414
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,008
Agent confirmed.

415
00:47:15,516 --> 00:47:18,226
How will the world finally end?

416
00:47:19,395 --> 00:47:22,355
It is my job to predict
the unthinkable.

417
00:47:23,899 --> 00:47:26,443
To treat the death of
billions as a game.

418
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:31,406
After 20 years of
this, I was numb.

419
00:47:32,241 --> 00:47:35,243
Until a new question
crossed my mind.

420
00:47:36,203 --> 00:47:39,039
What happens after the
end of the world?

421
00:47:39,206 --> 00:47:41,333
Are you sure your
line is secure?

422
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:43,168
Every two or three
million years...

423
00:47:43,252 --> 00:47:46,338
Are you certain your
line is secure?

424
00:47:46,422 --> 00:47:50,508
Some natural catastrophe
devastates all life on Earth.

425
00:47:50,593 --> 00:47:52,260
But life goes on.

426
00:47:52,595 --> 00:47:56,181
And what little remains
is made stronger.

427
00:47:56,265 --> 00:48:00,310
Put simply, world destruction
is an unpleasant,

428
00:48:00,394 --> 00:48:02,771
but necessary part of evolution.

429
00:48:05,399 --> 00:48:07,484
What happens then, I wondered,

430
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:10,195
when mankind faces the
next end of the world?

431
00:48:10,279 --> 00:48:13,323
I don't care what you have
to do to get him to Dubai.

432
00:48:13,407 --> 00:48:15,867
I'll make it worth his while.
Just do it.

433
00:48:15,951 --> 00:48:18,495
I looked to Hiroshima,
Nagasaki...

434
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:19,704
I'll be waiting for your call.

435
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:22,332
Thriving cities rebuilt
from the ashes,

436
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:24,751
monuments to the unimaginable,

437
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,711
dedicated to the
concept of peace.

438
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:31,925
It occurred to me here that
nuclear war might have a place

439
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,510
in the natural order.

440
00:48:33,594 --> 00:48:35,637
But only if it could
be controlled.

441
00:48:36,097 --> 00:48:40,308
Only if it touched every
living soul equally.

442
00:48:41,811 --> 00:48:44,854
IMF now believes this
man, Kurt Hendricks,

443
00:48:44,939 --> 00:48:47,899
is the nuclear extremist,
code name Cobalt.

444
00:48:47,983 --> 00:48:49,901
Today he was seen
leaving the Kremlin,

445
00:48:49,985 --> 00:48:52,654
with what is likely a
nuclear launch device.

446
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:58,118
Two days ago, Sabine Moreau killed
one of our agents in Budapest

447
00:48:58,202 --> 00:49:00,870
and relieved him of Russian
nuclear launch codes.

448
00:49:00,955 --> 00:49:05,458
Intel indicates she will check into
the Burj Hotel in Dubai in 36 hours.

449
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:08,878
Marius Wistrom is a known
operative of Cobalt.

450
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:11,423
Wistrom is currently
en route to Dubai.

451
00:49:11,507 --> 00:49:15,218
For the launch device to work,
Cobalt needs the activation codes.

452
00:49:15,302 --> 00:49:18,138
He's sending Wistrom to
buy them from Moreau.

453
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,640
The Secretary

454
00:49:22,184 --> 00:49:23,393
is dead.

455
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:31,568
The President has
invoked Ghost Protocol.

456
00:49:32,278 --> 00:49:33,862
We're shut down.

457
00:49:33,988 --> 00:49:37,949
No satellite, safe house,
support, or extraction.

458
00:49:38,033 --> 00:49:41,244
The four of us and the
contents of this car

459
00:49:41,328 --> 00:49:43,955
are all that remain of the IMF.

460
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:48,418
And as of this moment, any action is
unsanctioned. So if you want out,

461
00:49:48,502 --> 00:49:49,836
speak now.

462
00:50:06,353 --> 00:50:07,604
Our mission is Hendricks.

463
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,814
We're all that stands
between him and his goal.

464
00:50:09,899 --> 00:50:11,149
Nothing can be left to chance.

465
00:50:11,233 --> 00:50:13,276
Everyone connected with this man

466
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,613
is considered an asset with valuable
information about our target.

467
00:50:16,697 --> 00:50:18,114
No one can know we're
still on line.

468
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:20,492
We lose Hendricks now,
we lose him forever.

469
00:50:20,576 --> 00:50:22,160
So, what's the play?

470
00:50:22,244 --> 00:50:24,871
Wistrom will take delivery
from Moreau in 36 hours.

471
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:27,123
Now we cannot let the launch
codes leave the hotel,

472
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:30,084
but we need Wistrom to
lead us to Hendricks.

473
00:50:30,169 --> 00:50:32,295
He'll only do that
if he has the codes.

474
00:50:32,379 --> 00:50:33,797
Or if he thinks he has them.

475
00:50:33,881 --> 00:50:36,090
Our objective is to
intercept the sale,

476
00:50:36,175 --> 00:50:38,468
replace the authentic
codes with counterfeits

477
00:50:38,552 --> 00:50:40,303
and follow Wistrom to Hendricks.

478
00:50:40,387 --> 00:50:41,805
Well, that's simple enough.

479
00:50:41,889 --> 00:50:44,057
We snatch the codes,
we gin up some fakes.

480
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:48,812
Jane, you double Moreau, and sell the
codes to Wistrom and Bob's your uncle.

481
00:50:48,896 --> 00:50:52,315
And how do you propose we just
snatch the codes from Moreau?

482
00:50:52,399 --> 00:50:53,399
We take her out.

483
00:50:55,569 --> 00:50:58,321
Yeah, we take her out.
But, you know, discreetly.

484
00:50:58,405 --> 00:50:59,572
Discreetly?

485
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:01,324
Yeah.

486
00:51:02,368 --> 00:51:05,745
Right, she's an asset. Right. I get it.
Sorry. Nothing left to chance.

487
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,331
He said... I'm spitballing.
It's not all gonna be gold.

488
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,041
- We don't touch Wistrom.
- All right.

489
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:11,125
Or Moreau.

490
00:51:13,462 --> 00:51:16,548
She'll answer for Hanaway,
but it has to be when I say.

491
00:51:16,632 --> 00:51:18,341
After we hit Hendricks.

492
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,598
Only pack what we need.

493
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:28,268
Yeah, absolutely. Only pack what we...
You never know.

494
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,590
So even if we can double
Wistrom and Moreau,

495
00:51:59,341 --> 00:52:01,467
how do we keep them
in separate rooms

496
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:04,220
while having them think that
they're in the same room?

497
00:52:04,305 --> 00:52:06,306
We give the hotel a facelift.

498
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:09,267
Wistrom will think he's
arriving at Moreau's suite,

499
00:52:09,351 --> 00:52:11,603
but, really, he'll be walking
into our decoy room.

500
00:52:11,729 --> 00:52:13,229
Where I'll double Moreau.

501
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,856
Downstairs, Benji
will double Wistrom.

502
00:52:15,316 --> 00:52:16,316
Masks!

503
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,859
And meet with the real Moreau.

504
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,444
And...

505
00:52:20,154 --> 00:52:21,321
What am I doing?

506
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:24,574
You? You're the helper!

507
00:52:27,494 --> 00:52:28,870
Helper. That's great.

508
00:52:29,413 --> 00:52:33,416
Okay, so to the extent I understand
what you're talking about here...

509
00:52:34,668 --> 00:52:37,086
The Burj Khalifa, it's the
tallest building in the world,

510
00:52:37,171 --> 00:52:39,464
and you want to alter
its infrastructure

511
00:52:39,548 --> 00:52:42,342
with the hopes of convincing
two people that they've

512
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:45,762
had a meeting, which actually
really never happened.

513
00:52:46,513 --> 00:52:47,513
Right?

514
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:57,190
Camels.

515
00:53:44,738 --> 00:53:46,906
ETA on dry cleaning.

516
00:53:46,991 --> 00:53:48,491
On my way up.

517
00:53:52,037 --> 00:53:53,871
Okay, 34 minutes to door knock.

518
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,419
Wow...

519
00:54:00,754 --> 00:54:04,882
Okay, this is a slight wrinkle,
but nothing to worry about.

520
00:54:04,967 --> 00:54:08,302
We're just going to have to go into
the server room from the outside.

521
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:10,513
What?

522
00:54:11,056 --> 00:54:14,308
Well, the firewalls on this
building's server are military grade.

523
00:54:14,393 --> 00:54:16,227
I mean, this would be a cinch

524
00:54:16,311 --> 00:54:17,729
if I could call Youssef
back at headquarters,

525
00:54:17,813 --> 00:54:19,814
but Youssef doesn't exist
anymore, and neither do we.

526
00:54:19,898 --> 00:54:21,315
I could hack it, but it
would take too long.

527
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,525
Then hardwire in.

528
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:24,152
And there's four layers
of next-gen security

529
00:54:24,236 --> 00:54:25,528
between us and the server room.

530
00:54:25,612 --> 00:54:27,405
There's no way we can
get to it from inside.

531
00:54:28,115 --> 00:54:30,658
If we can't get to the server,
we don't control the elevators,

532
00:54:30,743 --> 00:54:32,618
we don't control the
security cameras.

533
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,787
This operation is over
before it even begins.

534
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:36,873
I'm telling you, we can
get to it from outside.

535
00:54:36,957 --> 00:54:37,957
"We"?

536
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:40,460
I'm... I'm on the computer.

537
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:44,297
I'm just...

538
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:45,715
The helper.

539
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:50,303
What floor is it on?

540
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,971
130.

541
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:54,390
130?

542
00:54:58,645 --> 00:54:59,771
- Vent ducts.
- Pressure sensitive.

543
00:54:59,855 --> 00:55:00,855
Not enough time.

544
00:55:00,939 --> 00:55:02,398
- Elevator shaft.
- Infrared sensors.

545
00:55:02,483 --> 00:55:03,483
Not enough time.

546
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:08,821
How am I supposed to do this?

547
00:55:14,953 --> 00:55:16,454
God damn it!

548
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:21,292
Oh, that's high.

549
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,843
Okay, now remember, it's a rolling
off motion that disengages the bond.

550
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:33,096
When the meter is blue,
that's full adhesion.

551
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,348
Easy way to remember,
blue is glue.

552
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:36,891
- And when it's red?
- Dead.

553
00:55:36,975 --> 00:55:39,852
Here's your cutter, okay?
And your server interface.

554
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:42,772
Both going back here. One, two.

555
00:55:43,107 --> 00:55:46,943
Okay, Ethan, the hotel server is eleven
stories up and seven units over.

556
00:55:47,027 --> 00:55:49,028
Okay? Comm check.

557
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,280
Yeah. Copy.

558
00:55:52,866 --> 00:55:54,033
So...

559
00:55:58,038 --> 00:56:00,540
It's 26 minutes to door knock.

560
00:56:02,543 --> 00:56:03,751
Yeah.

561
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:00,558
25 minutes to door knock.

562
00:57:15,574 --> 00:57:16,949
What the hell is that?

563
00:57:32,299 --> 00:57:34,592
Yeah, what the hell is that?

564
00:57:36,094 --> 00:57:37,803
It's a sandstorm.

565
00:57:39,932 --> 00:57:41,015
It's a long way off, Ethan.

566
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:42,475
Shouldn't be a problem.

567
00:57:45,437 --> 00:57:47,980
24 minutes to door knock.

568
00:57:50,943 --> 00:57:52,068
Where's Ethan?

569
00:57:55,113 --> 00:57:56,489
You've got to be kidding me.

570
00:58:46,331 --> 00:58:49,500
23 minutes to door knock.

571
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:09,478
I'm at server level.

572
00:59:32,252 --> 00:59:33,586
22 minutes to door knock.

573
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:37,340
The countdown is not helping.

574
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:40,343
I'm just saying.

575
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:11,707
I'm in.

576
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:13,209
That's great, Ethan.
You're halfway home.

577
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:22,301
Located server.

578
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:30,935
Please tell me we're online.

579
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:32,311
All right, we're live.

580
01:00:32,604 --> 01:00:36,649
Okay, I now have control of the
elevators and the security cameras.

581
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:37,733
Time to redecorate.

582
01:00:37,818 --> 01:00:40,736
Okay, you drive. And look
out for Wistrom and Moreau.

583
01:00:55,627 --> 01:00:57,837
Moreau is at the elevators
ahead of schedule.

584
01:00:58,839 --> 01:01:00,005
Go.

585
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:07,304
We can't open this door, can we?

586
01:01:07,389 --> 01:01:08,681
The door? No.

587
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:10,599
Ethan, you gotta
get down here now.

588
01:01:11,977 --> 01:01:13,477
Ethan!

589
01:01:13,937 --> 01:01:16,188
Is there a problem? Ethan?

590
01:01:23,488 --> 01:01:24,488
We're not gonna make it.

591
01:01:24,573 --> 01:01:25,573
We have to make it.

592
01:01:26,825 --> 01:01:27,825
Where's Ethan?

593
01:01:50,557 --> 01:01:52,183
Your line's not long enough!

594
01:01:52,726 --> 01:01:54,018
No shit!

595
01:02:41,024 --> 01:02:42,691
That was not easy,

596
01:02:42,776 --> 01:02:44,443
but I did it.

597
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:48,072
What'd I miss?

598
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:58,832
The lens might be a
little uncomfortable.

599
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:01,752
It captures images and transmits them
to the printer in the briefcase.

600
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:04,797
All right?

601
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:07,383
I can't see out of one
eye, but I'm fine.

602
01:03:07,467 --> 01:03:09,093
Blink twice to
activate the shutter.

603
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:11,971
Notice the numbers are in order?

604
01:03:15,475 --> 01:03:16,600
A perfect copy.

605
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:20,563
But the numbers are scrambled.

606
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:23,232
Masks?

607
01:03:23,316 --> 01:03:25,317
60 seconds. You sure I
shouldn't wear a mask?

608
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:27,570
You know, 'cause I'm not
exactly Omar Sharif.

609
01:03:27,654 --> 01:03:29,822
I'll play it French. This
is your tracking device.

610
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:31,574
- This is what you're tracking.
- The paper clip?

611
01:03:31,658 --> 01:03:32,658
No, it's the paper.

612
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:35,286
It's in the briefcase. It's coated with
isotopes which give off a unique...

613
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:36,870
It just means that you
can track the documents

614
01:03:36,955 --> 01:03:38,080
even if they switch briefcases.

615
01:03:38,164 --> 01:03:39,123
Range?

616
01:03:39,207 --> 01:03:40,249
Not that good. It's,
like, half a mile.

617
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:42,501
Safest thing to do would be not
let Wistrom out of your sight.

618
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:44,003
Is that Wistrom?

619
01:03:48,425 --> 01:03:49,425
Who's that with him?

620
01:03:49,509 --> 01:03:52,094
I don't know. We don't have an uplink,
so there's no facial recognition.

621
01:03:52,178 --> 01:03:53,596
Who's that with him?

622
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:57,600
That's Leonid Lisenker.
Polish-born cryptographer.

623
01:03:57,684 --> 01:04:00,102
He redesigned Russia's nuclear
security after the Cold War.

624
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,771
He's here to authenticate
the launch codes.

625
01:04:02,856 --> 01:04:04,940
- Yes, he is. We are blown.
- No, we're not blown.

626
01:04:05,025 --> 01:04:07,234
Well, we will be as soon as he
sees the counterfeit launch codes.

627
01:04:07,319 --> 01:04:08,319
We're not blown.

628
01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:10,154
He's in the elevator.

629
01:04:10,238 --> 01:04:11,447
Delay them.

630
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,583
Benji, how long would it take
you to reprogram the case?

631
01:04:22,667 --> 01:04:24,877
A couple of seconds.
What for, though?

632
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:27,129
To make an exact copy
of the launch codes.

633
01:04:27,213 --> 01:04:28,797
- What?
- You can't do that.

634
01:04:28,882 --> 01:04:30,382
- Wistrom's on 22!
- Slow him down.

635
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:31,467
I'll do what I can.

636
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:35,888
Wait, wait. Ethan, hang on now!

637
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,306
Hang on. Just a second.

638
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:40,893
You're talking about handing over
active nuclear launch codes to Wistrom?

639
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:42,061
Yes. Reprogram the case.

640
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:43,145
Listen... Stop!

641
01:04:43,229 --> 01:04:44,229
Just listen to what
you're saying.

642
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:46,106
You're fixating. You're
not thinking clearly.

643
01:04:46,191 --> 01:04:49,234
It's not gonna happen.
I won't let it!

644
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:50,653
33 and climbing!

645
01:04:50,737 --> 01:04:51,904
Brandt, use your head now.

646
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:53,697
The mission is not the codes,
the mission is Hendricks.

647
01:04:53,782 --> 01:04:56,200
Then just let it play out. Give
him bad codes. Neutralize him.

648
01:04:56,284 --> 01:04:57,326
You know that won't do it.

649
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:59,995
Failure to a terrorist is
just a rehearsal for success.

650
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,413
41!

651
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:03,749
We lose Hendricks today, he shows
up somewhere else tomorrow.

652
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:04,917
He finds another way.

653
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:06,502
With no IMF to stop him.

654
01:05:06,586 --> 01:05:08,754
No. It's now or never. Now,
Brandt, give me the case.

655
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:11,006
Nothing can be left to chance.
You said that.

656
01:05:11,091 --> 01:05:12,091
You're the analyst.

657
01:05:12,175 --> 01:05:14,259
Now, tell me there's not another way
for Hendricks to get those codes.

658
01:05:14,344 --> 01:05:15,344
50!

659
01:05:15,428 --> 01:05:18,013
You tell me that this is his only
avenue, right here, right now, today.

660
01:05:18,098 --> 01:05:20,516
You tell me that,
I'll walk away.

661
01:05:28,191 --> 01:05:29,858
- We go without.
- Without masks?

662
01:05:29,943 --> 01:05:31,235
- Jane needs to go.
- Ethan!

663
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:32,319
We have no choice.

664
01:05:32,404 --> 01:05:34,029
Ethan, you'd be walking
in on Moreau unarmed.

665
01:05:34,114 --> 01:05:35,364
Face-first. Literally.

666
01:05:35,448 --> 01:05:36,448
How do we know they've met?

667
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,534
- How do we know they haven't?
- Doesn't matter!

668
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:41,203
Damn it.

669
01:05:41,454 --> 01:05:42,788
We have no choice.

670
01:06:34,257 --> 01:06:35,591
Goggles.

671
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:39,511
What if they have met?

672
01:06:42,015 --> 01:06:43,932
Come in.

673
01:07:18,802 --> 01:07:23,472
Which one of you is Wistrom?

674
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:27,643
I am.

675
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:30,979
I admire your work.

676
01:07:46,412 --> 01:07:47,579
Sit.

677
01:07:56,506 --> 01:07:58,090
Where are my codes?

678
01:07:59,592 --> 01:08:01,093
Where are my diamonds?

679
01:08:02,262 --> 01:08:03,512
Close by.

680
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:05,764
You have my payment?

681
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,724
When I see the codes.

682
01:08:08,852 --> 01:08:10,561
Not to worry. Come in!

683
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:13,021
I thought we could have tea.

684
01:08:20,363 --> 01:08:22,698
No diamonds, no codes.

685
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,534
No codes, no diamonds.

686
01:08:29,497 --> 01:08:30,497
Kill this one.

687
01:08:30,582 --> 01:08:32,541
We didn't come alone.

688
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:34,543
That hallway out
there is a kill-box.

689
01:08:34,711 --> 01:08:36,044
You know who we work for.

690
01:08:36,129 --> 01:08:38,630
We come back with the codes,
or we don't come back.

691
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:41,884
How good is your backup?

692
01:08:42,135 --> 01:08:43,552
The best.

693
01:08:46,973 --> 01:08:49,266
I've killed the best.

694
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:51,894
Do you care for some sugar?

695
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:57,900
Enough. Let's get this done.

696
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:00,652
You want payment, I
want guarantees.

697
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:02,571
When he's authenticated
the codes,

698
01:09:02,655 --> 01:09:05,157
I'll make the call and
you get your diamonds.

699
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:06,909
That or

700
01:09:07,452 --> 01:09:09,453
we all go home in buckets.

701
01:09:10,413 --> 01:09:12,915
Nobody leaves this hotel alive.

702
01:09:16,628 --> 01:09:17,628
Get the papers.

703
01:09:32,435 --> 01:09:33,769
Is there a problem?

704
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:35,771
It's locked.

705
01:09:39,776 --> 01:09:43,612
Forgive me. There must be a key.

706
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:46,448
One moment, huh?

707
01:10:44,257 --> 01:10:48,301
My mistake. It is a
combination, not a key.

708
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:50,512
You tell me the numbers.

709
01:10:56,477 --> 01:10:57,477
They're good.

710
01:10:57,770 --> 01:11:04,359
Zero.

711
01:11:21,544 --> 01:11:22,794
Come on, come on, come on.

712
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:08,507
It was a pleasure doing
business with...

713
01:12:08,591 --> 01:12:10,759
Wistrom has the launch codes.
He's on the move.

714
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:14,763
Hey, I did as you asked. I did.
Now let my family go!

715
01:12:15,014 --> 01:12:16,431
Release Leonid's family.

716
01:12:16,516 --> 01:12:17,808
Thank God.

717
01:12:17,892 --> 01:12:19,351
You can thank him in person.

718
01:12:35,118 --> 01:12:37,536
It was a pleasure doing
business with you.

719
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:45,460
Kill him!

720
01:12:54,137 --> 01:12:55,303
Moreau's on the move!

721
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:57,639
I've got her.

722
01:12:58,975 --> 01:12:59,975
Jane?

723
01:13:00,059 --> 01:13:01,059
She's an asset!

724
01:13:01,269 --> 01:13:02,644
I need her

725
01:13:02,728 --> 01:13:03,728
alive!

726
01:13:05,106 --> 01:13:07,941
Acknowledge!

727
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:22,831
Ethan, Wistrom is in the elevator.
I can't see Leonid, though.

728
01:13:24,709 --> 01:13:27,836
Benji, slow him down.
Get me an elevator.

729
01:13:40,183 --> 01:13:41,433
Find Leonid.

730
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:57,240
Benji, I've got a lock on Wistrom.
But I can't tell.

731
01:13:57,325 --> 01:13:58,992
Is he still in the elevator?

732
01:14:00,453 --> 01:14:01,453
Benji?

733
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:06,458
Ethan. Over?

734
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:07,584
Benji.

735
01:14:07,668 --> 01:14:08,710
Benji, I lost...

736
01:14:08,794 --> 01:14:10,378
Ethan, can you hear me?

737
01:14:10,463 --> 01:14:11,963
Ethan, can you hear me? Over.

738
01:14:13,132 --> 01:14:14,299
Jesus!

739
01:14:20,473 --> 01:14:21,681
Sit down!

740
01:14:23,643 --> 01:14:25,310
- Watch her.
- Why me?

741
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:26,895
Because if I do, I'll kill her.

742
01:14:56,676 --> 01:14:59,010
Hold it, Team Leader.

743
01:14:59,929 --> 01:15:02,430
Did you really think I
wouldn't catch up with you?

744
01:15:02,515 --> 01:15:04,516
You and I are not enemies.
It was a set-up...

745
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,394
We'll find out your
lies soon enough.

746
01:15:07,812 --> 01:15:09,020
Move it!

747
01:15:10,064 --> 01:15:11,648
I'm sorry about this.

748
01:15:34,422 --> 01:15:35,922
Leonid. Benji?

749
01:15:36,382 --> 01:15:37,424
Go for Benji.

750
01:15:37,508 --> 01:15:39,384
I've got Leonid by the elevators.
He's been shot.

751
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:40,468
What?

752
01:15:51,314 --> 01:15:54,065
Hey, hey. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

753
01:16:13,127 --> 01:16:14,711
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

754
01:16:21,052 --> 01:16:22,677
Jane! No!

755
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:25,652
Come on. Come on.

756
01:22:19,284 --> 01:22:20,785
Now, what happened
with Moreau, Jane?

757
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:21,911
She couldn't help
us with Hendricks.

758
01:22:21,995 --> 01:22:23,538
So let's throw her
off the building!

759
01:22:23,622 --> 01:22:24,622
I didn't throw her.

760
01:22:24,707 --> 01:22:25,707
Let's throw her
off the building!

761
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:28,251
She was not the mission, Jane!

762
01:22:28,335 --> 01:22:33,297
The mission was to track the file
back to Hendricks, who is in the wind

763
01:22:33,382 --> 01:22:35,550
with nuclear launch codes!

764
01:22:35,634 --> 01:22:38,386
Maybe you didn't notice the
gun she had pointed at me.

765
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:40,722
Yeah, like you didn't
notice the open window,

766
01:22:40,806 --> 01:22:42,640
or that we're about a
mile up in the air!

767
01:22:42,725 --> 01:22:44,392
It was an instinctive move.

768
01:22:44,476 --> 01:22:45,476
It doesn't matter!

769
01:22:45,561 --> 01:22:47,395
We're talking about
a nuclear war.

770
01:22:47,479 --> 01:22:49,939
The asset is more
important than you.

771
01:22:50,023 --> 01:22:52,400
Where do you get off telling
me how well I executed?

772
01:22:52,484 --> 01:22:53,693
We inherited you.

773
01:22:54,319 --> 01:22:56,279
You're just a bureaucrat!

774
01:22:56,363 --> 01:22:58,781
Better have good news for me.
Is he here?

775
01:22:58,866 --> 01:23:01,159
You think I need you to tell
me what the mission is?

776
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:04,036
Yeah, I got it. Dunhill lighter.
I'll be there.

777
01:23:04,121 --> 01:23:05,788
And no one will be following me.

778
01:23:05,873 --> 01:23:07,665
Just make sure no
one's following you.

779
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:09,459
And how the hell did
the Russians find us?

780
01:23:09,543 --> 01:23:11,377
- What are you asking me for?
- Because you're communications!

781
01:23:11,462 --> 01:23:13,254
You're in charge of
covering our tracks.

782
01:23:13,338 --> 01:23:16,132
You cannot afford to make
mistakes like that now, Benji.

783
01:23:16,216 --> 01:23:18,551
You're not a technician anymore.
You're a field agent.

784
01:23:18,635 --> 01:23:21,179
And you're just an "analyst."

785
01:23:21,263 --> 01:23:24,307
Right?

786
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:27,643
Who are you really, Brandt?

787
01:23:29,313 --> 01:23:31,189
- What are you asking?
- What am I asking?

788
01:23:31,273 --> 01:23:33,024
Let me see if I can
put it another way.

789
01:23:40,157 --> 01:23:44,368
How does an agent with skills
like that end up an analyst?

790
01:23:52,503 --> 01:23:54,712
Well, we all have our secrets.

791
01:23:56,215 --> 01:23:57,799
Don't we, Ethan?

792
01:24:02,721 --> 01:24:05,348
You tell me yours,
I'll tell you mine.

793
01:24:25,077 --> 01:24:27,286
I have friends in the region.
Just sit tight.

794
01:24:27,371 --> 01:24:28,913
I'll send someone to
get you out of here.

795
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:30,164
What about Hendricks?
What's the plan?

796
01:24:30,249 --> 01:24:32,959
The plan was for us
to stop him together.

797
01:24:33,418 --> 01:24:35,545
Well, what are you going to do?

798
01:24:35,629 --> 01:24:36,671
Change the plan.

799
01:24:36,755 --> 01:24:38,965
Wait. That's it?

800
01:24:39,049 --> 01:24:41,968
What are you going to
do, go after him alone?

801
01:24:43,595 --> 01:24:46,681
Would you care to explain
yourself, Agent Brandt?

802
01:25:50,495 --> 01:25:53,581
I was on a protection
detail in Croatia.

803
01:25:53,665 --> 01:25:56,751
Shadowing the assets,
husband and wife.

804
01:25:57,836 --> 01:25:59,712
They were never supposed
to know we were there.

805
01:25:59,796 --> 01:26:02,506
Whole thing's routine,
it was a milk run.

806
01:26:05,177 --> 01:26:06,636
Three days in

807
01:26:07,846 --> 01:26:11,432
we caught wind that a Serbian
hit squad was after our couple.

808
01:26:11,516 --> 01:26:14,101
But my team had
it under control.

809
01:26:14,186 --> 01:26:16,187
We knew they were coming.

810
01:26:16,772 --> 01:26:21,025
But I couldn't shake this feeling that
I should warn the couple somehow.

811
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:23,486
I wanted to find a way
to let them know.

812
01:26:25,864 --> 01:26:28,783
But, you know, orders are
orders, so I didn't.

813
01:26:33,705 --> 01:26:38,125
One day, the husband decides to
leave the hotel and go for a run,

814
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:42,213
so I follow him, and I leave
two men with the wife.

815
01:26:43,757 --> 01:26:47,885
When I get back, my guys are
unconscious and the wife is gone.

816
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:52,723
Local police found her
body three days later.

817
01:26:53,767 --> 01:26:55,685
What was left of her, anyway.

818
01:27:01,358 --> 01:27:03,734
That was my last
day in the field.

819
01:27:04,778 --> 01:27:07,822
I couldn't face another
life-or-death situation after that.

820
01:27:07,906 --> 01:27:10,491
So what happened to the husband?

821
01:27:10,575 --> 01:27:11,742
I never saw him again.

822
01:27:13,662 --> 01:27:15,413
Until two days ago in Moscow,

823
01:27:15,497 --> 01:27:18,249
when the Secretary
introduced me to Ethan Hunt.

824
01:27:21,962 --> 01:27:25,423
No, that's not what happened.
She left him.

825
01:27:25,507 --> 01:27:28,259
Yeah, I heard that
one, too, Benji.

826
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:31,679
But, unfortunately, I was there.

827
01:27:33,098 --> 01:27:36,851
Just like I was there when the
Secretary got the phone call

828
01:27:36,935 --> 01:27:41,272
that Ethan was in custody for killing
six Serbian nationals in cold blood.

829
01:27:41,356 --> 01:27:42,523
An unsanctioned hit.

830
01:27:42,607 --> 01:27:43,566
Yeah.

831
01:27:43,650 --> 01:27:45,401
Disavowed.

832
01:27:54,119 --> 01:27:55,369
The next thing I know,

833
01:27:56,288 --> 01:27:58,289
I'm on a plane to Dubai,

834
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:03,377
wondering the whole
time, do I tell him?

835
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:07,298
How do I tell him?

836
01:28:09,509 --> 01:28:11,302
That I'm responsible.

837
01:28:13,889 --> 01:28:15,056
I could have warned him.

838
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:17,141
I should have warned him.

839
01:28:19,603 --> 01:28:21,062
But I didn't.

840
01:28:22,814 --> 01:28:24,273
And she died.

841
01:28:30,739 --> 01:28:34,408
Sergei! Sergei, my friend!

842
01:28:34,493 --> 01:28:37,536
I told you I would get him here.
Didn't I say?

843
01:28:37,621 --> 01:28:38,746
How do I know it's him?

844
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:42,333
Yes, it's him. You trust
me, I trust you. Right?

845
01:28:42,834 --> 01:28:44,293
This is the guy!

846
01:28:44,377 --> 01:28:47,088
This is the guy, the
one I told you about.

847
01:28:47,172 --> 01:28:49,715
So we can take these things off.

848
01:28:54,471 --> 01:28:57,348
Sorry. He's a great guy, but
he doesn't know you like I do.

849
01:28:57,432 --> 01:29:00,518
So, you work for the
American government.

850
01:29:01,895 --> 01:29:03,395
And you're an arms dealer.

851
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,815
No, no, no. Sergei. Sergei.

852
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:10,444
He's "independent defense
coordinator." Right?

853
01:29:11,655 --> 01:29:13,614
That you are. Very classy job.

854
01:29:13,698 --> 01:29:14,782
Listen. He's a friend.

855
01:29:14,866 --> 01:29:16,450
Those diamonds are for Bogdan.

856
01:29:16,535 --> 01:29:18,536
No, no. It's okay.
You can have them.

857
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:21,789
Whatever arrangements you made with
my cousin is between you and him.

858
01:29:21,873 --> 01:29:24,708
You want something
from me, you pay.

859
01:29:24,793 --> 01:29:29,046
You misunderstand. I'm not buying.
I'm selling.

860
01:29:29,798 --> 01:29:31,966
You're selling.

861
01:29:32,050 --> 01:29:33,259
Selling what?

862
01:29:33,343 --> 01:29:34,718
The future.

863
01:29:34,803 --> 01:29:37,596
Yeah, I got all I
need, thank you.

864
01:29:37,681 --> 01:29:39,348
Our countries are on
the brink of war.

865
01:29:39,933 --> 01:29:41,809
War is very good for business.

866
01:29:41,893 --> 01:29:43,435
Nuclear war?

867
01:29:53,905 --> 01:29:54,989
Go on.

868
01:29:55,073 --> 01:29:57,032
I'm looking for a man
named Kurt Hendricks.

869
01:29:57,117 --> 01:29:58,742
You may know him as Cobalt.

870
01:29:58,827 --> 01:30:01,579
In either case, I think
you know what he wants.

871
01:30:01,663 --> 01:30:04,331
I'll bet he even tried to buy
it from you at some point.

872
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:06,792
Go on.

873
01:30:06,877 --> 01:30:08,961
He has a case, he has codes.

874
01:30:09,713 --> 01:30:13,007
But they're worthless without
a tactical satellite.

875
01:30:13,091 --> 01:30:15,426
I want to know
where he'd get it.

876
01:30:16,094 --> 01:30:19,597
A man with information like that
would be a potential terrorist.

877
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:22,474
And to your government,

878
01:30:22,559 --> 01:30:26,645
a potential terrorist
is a terrorist.

879
01:30:29,608 --> 01:30:30,608
If you help me,

880
01:30:31,943 --> 01:30:34,945
my friends become your friends.

881
01:30:38,074 --> 01:30:39,241
Sorry.

882
01:30:40,535 --> 01:30:42,203
I cannot help you.

883
01:30:47,709 --> 01:30:50,753
I certainly cannot tell you
that Russia quietly sold

884
01:30:50,837 --> 01:30:54,632
an obsolete tactical satellite
to a certain telecom in Mumbai.

885
01:30:56,468 --> 01:30:58,385
And whoever gave them that idea?

886
01:31:00,347 --> 01:31:02,264
An enterprising third party.

887
01:31:02,349 --> 01:31:03,849
Working on commission.

888
01:31:03,934 --> 01:31:07,186
Helping old friends.
Making new ones.

889
01:31:07,854 --> 01:31:09,230
Can the satellite be shut down?

890
01:31:09,314 --> 01:31:11,232
That would take special skills,

891
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:13,651
and you cannot do it alone.

892
01:31:40,011 --> 01:31:41,637
What's in the bags?

893
01:31:41,721 --> 01:31:43,097
It's our gear.

894
01:31:43,181 --> 01:31:44,974
How'd you get it?

895
01:31:45,058 --> 01:31:46,225
Made a friend.

896
01:31:47,352 --> 01:31:48,602
Well, I'm glad we could help.

897
01:31:48,687 --> 01:31:50,479
You could help now.

898
01:31:50,563 --> 01:31:52,439
Look, Ethan, before we...

899
01:31:52,524 --> 01:31:53,774
Whatever happened, happened.

900
01:31:54,317 --> 01:31:57,069
We still have a chance to clean
this up, but we have to do it now.

901
01:31:58,071 --> 01:32:00,281
And we have to do it together.

902
01:32:07,539 --> 01:32:08,914
Okay. So, where are we going?

903
01:32:10,667 --> 01:32:11,667
India.

904
01:32:15,171 --> 01:32:16,714
- India? India?
- Sure.

905
01:32:16,798 --> 01:32:17,881
Okay. Great.

906
01:32:21,553 --> 01:32:23,053
Love the jet.

907
01:32:23,763 --> 01:32:25,556
Wait till you see the car.

908
01:32:32,147 --> 01:32:33,188
Sidorov.

909
01:32:33,356 --> 01:32:34,898
How have you been, old friend?

910
01:32:35,066 --> 01:32:36,191
Oh, it's you.

911
01:32:37,152 --> 01:32:40,321
I've been busy
with other things.

912
01:32:40,405 --> 01:32:42,364
But I'll be after you
again soon enough.

913
01:32:44,909 --> 01:32:47,786
I understand you're looking
for an American...

914
01:32:47,954 --> 01:32:48,954
I am.

915
01:32:50,081 --> 01:32:55,919
You're also looking for a nuclear launch
device stolen from the Kremlin two days ago.

916
01:32:56,379 --> 01:32:57,421
I am?

917
01:32:57,672 --> 01:32:59,965
I can help you find both.

918
01:33:00,925 --> 01:33:03,886
If... we can come to
an understanding.

919
01:33:10,018 --> 01:33:11,226
Brij Nath.

920
01:33:11,311 --> 01:33:13,812
Brij Nath. Playboy.
Multimedia tycoon.

921
01:33:13,897 --> 01:33:16,857
On the surface, his entire
network is state-of-the-art.

922
01:33:16,941 --> 01:33:18,859
But it's built on
illegally acquired

923
01:33:18,943 --> 01:33:22,821
Cold War cast-offs, including
this, the Novosti satellite.

924
01:33:22,906 --> 01:33:24,698
Hendricks needs it to
launch a nuclear strike,

925
01:33:24,783 --> 01:33:27,284
and we have to shut it down
before he gets that chance.

926
01:33:27,369 --> 01:33:29,953
And to do that, we need to get
the access code from him.

927
01:33:30,038 --> 01:33:31,372
One way or another.

928
01:33:32,624 --> 01:33:34,166
And if I don't,

929
01:33:35,126 --> 01:33:36,668
none of this works.

930
01:33:37,962 --> 01:33:39,088
You can do this.

931
01:33:39,172 --> 01:33:40,297
Yeah.

932
01:33:41,132 --> 01:33:43,926
A week ago, I would
have believed you.

933
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:51,558
I don't blame you
for what happened.

934
01:33:56,314 --> 01:33:59,983
She took someone you cared about.
That's not something you just

935
01:34:00,402 --> 01:34:01,402
let go.

936
01:34:03,154 --> 01:34:05,280
Did it make you feel better?

937
01:34:07,784 --> 01:34:10,702
When you killed the men
who killed your wife?

938
01:34:18,795 --> 01:34:20,671
We can't get them back.

939
01:34:27,053 --> 01:34:28,303
Okay, to shut down
the satellite,

940
01:34:28,388 --> 01:34:31,181
we have to manually tap
into the central server.

941
01:34:31,266 --> 01:34:34,893
You'll enter through the exhaust
vent, wearing this under your suit.

942
01:34:34,978 --> 01:34:37,604
Drop down into the computer
array, and I'll catch you,

943
01:34:37,689 --> 01:34:41,024
then move you along the relay
room and you jack into the panel.

944
01:34:44,696 --> 01:34:47,281
Okay, so we enter the party
separately as guests.

945
01:34:47,365 --> 01:34:49,158
Ethan quarterbacks while Jane...

946
01:34:49,242 --> 01:34:50,742
Gets the codes from
the billionaire.

947
01:34:50,827 --> 01:34:52,870
I switch off the fan, you
jump into the computer array,

948
01:34:52,954 --> 01:34:54,997
and I catch you, you
plug in the transmitter

949
01:34:55,081 --> 01:34:58,750
then Ethan feeds me the codes which I
then use to pinpoint Hendricks' location.

950
01:34:58,835 --> 01:35:02,004
Okay, but you just breezed over
something I think is really important.

951
01:35:02,088 --> 01:35:04,923
The computer array
part, where I just...

952
01:35:05,967 --> 01:35:07,009
Jump?

953
01:35:07,844 --> 01:35:09,470
- And I catch you.
- Yeah.

954
01:35:09,554 --> 01:35:11,305
I don't... Why is that
so hard to grasp?

955
01:35:11,973 --> 01:35:13,015
Well...

956
01:35:13,099 --> 01:35:17,811
Why? It's a 25-foot drop.
And we're using magnets.

957
01:35:17,896 --> 01:35:19,229
Yeah.

958
01:35:19,981 --> 01:35:23,066
In light of our recent
efforts, the technology's...

959
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:25,110
The science is sound. All right?

960
01:35:25,195 --> 01:35:26,820
I'd be more worried
about the heat.

961
01:35:28,114 --> 01:35:30,240
And then there's that.
What heat?

962
01:35:31,034 --> 01:35:32,242
Well, it's like any
computer, isn't it?

963
01:35:32,327 --> 01:35:35,329
If you switch off the fan,
it's gonna get really hot!

964
01:35:35,413 --> 01:35:36,497
Of course.

965
01:35:36,581 --> 01:35:38,207
Relatively, you know.

966
01:35:39,709 --> 01:35:43,212
Of course it will. So
I'm jumping into a...

967
01:35:44,631 --> 01:35:47,591
An oven, essentially.

968
01:35:48,218 --> 01:35:49,885
Yeah. Essentially.

969
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:52,387
But I'll catch you.

970
01:35:54,265 --> 01:35:55,432
Great.

971
01:36:24,128 --> 01:36:26,630
Aapka swagat hai, sir.
Welcome, sir.

972
01:37:18,308 --> 01:37:19,683
Comm check.

973
01:37:20,351 --> 01:37:23,061
Saturn's got your
five-by-five, Jupiter.

974
01:37:24,689 --> 01:37:26,189
This is Pluto.

975
01:37:28,359 --> 01:37:30,444
I have arrived at the party.

976
01:37:33,865 --> 01:37:34,865
There he is.

977
01:37:47,086 --> 01:37:48,712
Get us that code.

978
01:37:57,388 --> 01:37:59,181
Venus moving in on target.

979
01:38:11,027 --> 01:38:12,361
Hook's in.

980
01:38:14,405 --> 01:38:16,406
You do make an impression.

981
01:38:20,411 --> 01:38:21,411
Why am I Pluto?

982
01:38:21,496 --> 01:38:23,330
It's not even a planet anymore.

983
01:38:23,414 --> 01:38:25,165
Well, I think Uranus
is available.

984
01:38:25,249 --> 01:38:27,542
It's funny 'cause
you said "anus."

985
01:38:41,933 --> 01:38:42,933
I'm in position.

986
01:38:43,518 --> 01:38:45,310
Sending in the Rover.

987
01:38:49,941 --> 01:38:51,149
He's moving to you.

988
01:38:51,234 --> 01:38:52,943
Give him your back.

989
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:55,445
Don't want to make
it too easy for him.

990
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:57,030
Are you gonna be talking
the whole time?

991
01:38:58,199 --> 01:39:01,576
In 20 minutes, I want a glass of
Cuvée Louis in every guest's hand.

992
01:39:01,661 --> 01:39:04,663
And make sure all of them have a bottle
to take home by the end of the night.

993
01:39:04,747 --> 01:39:05,831
Sure.

994
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:10,669
Impressed yet?

995
01:39:11,963 --> 01:39:13,505
I'm more of a bourbon girl.

996
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:20,804
I'm Brij Nath.

997
01:39:21,305 --> 01:39:23,348
Welcome to my humble home.

998
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:47,497
And Rover's in position.

999
01:39:48,833 --> 01:39:50,041
Spinning down the turbine.

1000
01:39:58,217 --> 01:39:59,217
He's e-mailing.

1001
01:39:59,927 --> 01:40:01,428
Venus. Be Venus.

1002
01:40:01,512 --> 01:40:02,846
Be Venus.

1003
01:40:11,147 --> 01:40:12,355
Husband?

1004
01:40:13,024 --> 01:40:14,024
Boyfriend?

1005
01:40:15,067 --> 01:40:16,401
More of a

1006
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:18,361
co-worker.

1007
01:40:19,155 --> 01:40:21,156
Saturn, take the leap.

1008
01:40:25,745 --> 01:40:26,870
Okay.

1009
01:40:30,833 --> 01:40:32,292
Jumping.

1010
01:40:32,376 --> 01:40:34,044
Jumping now.

1011
01:40:36,422 --> 01:40:37,422
Jump now?

1012
01:40:37,507 --> 01:40:39,549
Yes. Commit. Jump.

1013
01:40:39,842 --> 01:40:41,510
- Jump.
- Jump.

1014
01:40:41,594 --> 01:40:43,512
- And I catch you.
- Now.

1015
01:40:47,058 --> 01:40:50,185
So, you're sure about
this suit, right, Benji?

1016
01:40:50,269 --> 01:40:51,311
Pretty sure.

1017
01:40:52,063 --> 01:40:54,856
Now you're pretty sure?

1018
01:40:55,942 --> 01:40:56,942
Jump.

1019
01:40:58,069 --> 01:41:00,237
Oh, God. All right.

1020
01:41:01,239 --> 01:41:02,239
Jump.

1021
01:41:03,658 --> 01:41:04,699
Jump!

1022
01:41:22,802 --> 01:41:25,303
Jupiter, he's gone.

1023
01:41:29,809 --> 01:41:30,809
Did you jump?

1024
01:41:30,893 --> 01:41:32,769
Should I not have jumped?

1025
01:41:33,771 --> 01:41:34,771
'Cause I jumped!

1026
01:41:37,066 --> 01:41:38,358
Stand by.

1027
01:41:46,367 --> 01:41:47,868
I'm playing a hunch.

1028
01:41:48,953 --> 01:41:50,412
Don't hit me.

1029
01:42:07,805 --> 01:42:08,847
Hello?

1030
01:42:08,931 --> 01:42:10,682
My God, you are

1031
01:42:10,766 --> 01:42:12,893
a passionate creature.

1032
01:42:14,812 --> 01:42:17,772
I would like to show you
my collection of art.

1033
01:42:18,441 --> 01:42:20,275
I was waiting for you to ask.

1034
01:42:20,359 --> 01:42:22,110
Then you have to find me.

1035
01:42:22,194 --> 01:42:23,403
You're on.

1036
01:42:23,487 --> 01:42:25,655
I'm heading upstairs.

1037
01:42:43,466 --> 01:42:44,966
All right, now be careful,

1038
01:42:45,051 --> 01:42:47,260
because it's probably
getting a bit hot.

1039
01:42:47,345 --> 01:42:49,679
We have to get to that satellite
before Hendricks does.

1040
01:43:04,695 --> 01:43:07,447
Look left. Look up.

1041
01:43:07,531 --> 01:43:10,200
I find your capricious
passion intriguing.

1042
01:43:11,535 --> 01:43:13,703
Let me tell you one thing.
He's not your type.

1043
01:43:13,788 --> 01:43:17,040
Completely not your type. He's
completely cold. I'm hot.

1044
01:43:19,126 --> 01:43:21,586
Like all Indian
men, I'm very hot.

1045
01:43:21,671 --> 01:43:22,629
Eight o'clock.

1046
01:43:22,713 --> 01:43:23,713
Hot! Very hot.

1047
01:43:23,798 --> 01:43:25,632
He's at your eight o'clock.

1048
01:43:25,716 --> 01:43:28,051
As you move towards me,
you're getting hotter.

1049
01:43:29,053 --> 01:43:31,972
Whoa. Up, up! Up, up!

1050
01:43:32,056 --> 01:43:34,516
Too much, too much, too much!

1051
01:43:39,063 --> 01:43:40,397
I see you.

1052
01:43:42,108 --> 01:43:45,652
I'd heard you have one of the finest
private collections in the world.

1053
01:43:45,736 --> 01:43:48,321
Well, at the very
least, it's private.

1054
01:44:07,425 --> 01:44:09,384
Saturn? How we doing
in the relay room?

1055
01:44:09,468 --> 01:44:10,468
In position.

1056
01:44:12,847 --> 01:44:14,180
I see the satellite.

1057
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:22,230
Can I help you, gentlemen?

1058
01:44:22,314 --> 01:44:23,898
I don't think so.

1059
01:44:30,281 --> 01:44:31,781
Need those codes, guys.

1060
01:44:40,666 --> 01:44:43,668
All originals from
Chhatarpur District.

1061
01:44:47,006 --> 01:44:49,215
You know, the Tantrics believe

1062
01:44:50,801 --> 01:44:55,555
that the Swadhisthana chakra hides
our most subconscious of desires.

1063
01:45:47,525 --> 01:45:51,444
Uplink to satellite. Reboot
to original military specs.

1064
01:45:51,779 --> 01:45:53,530
Download the virus.

1065
01:46:01,372 --> 01:46:05,625
What the hell is that?

1066
01:46:05,709 --> 01:46:06,668
What the hell is what?

1067
01:46:06,752 --> 01:46:08,128
It's going haywire!

1068
01:46:08,212 --> 01:46:10,130
It's downloaded a virus
from the satellite.

1069
01:46:10,214 --> 01:46:11,422
Hendricks is killing the server

1070
01:46:11,507 --> 01:46:13,133
before we can kill
the satellite.

1071
01:46:13,217 --> 01:46:15,301
Hendricks is reprogramming
the satellite.

1072
01:46:15,386 --> 01:46:18,471
He's gonna have launch
capability in five minutes!

1073
01:46:18,556 --> 01:46:20,515
- Something wrong?
- No.

1074
01:46:21,183 --> 01:46:23,351
Jane, you gotta move.
We need that code.

1075
01:46:23,435 --> 01:46:25,311
Finally we're alone.

1076
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:35,488
Venus, now's the time.
Kick his ass

1077
01:46:35,573 --> 01:46:37,240
and get the code.

1078
01:46:37,575 --> 01:46:40,743
We are alone, aren't we?

1079
01:46:41,412 --> 01:46:44,080
No one will interrupt us.

1080
01:46:48,419 --> 01:46:50,086
Move and I break your neck.

1081
01:46:50,171 --> 01:46:52,755
The override sequence
for the relay station.

1082
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,133
Say it now or never speak again.

1083
01:46:56,135 --> 01:46:57,343
The codes.

1084
01:46:58,596 --> 01:47:00,889
46, 82,

1085
01:47:01,765 --> 01:47:03,266
93.

1086
01:47:06,187 --> 01:47:07,187
Benji, what happened?

1087
01:47:07,271 --> 01:47:09,022
The system's crashed!
We're too late.

1088
01:47:09,106 --> 01:47:10,732
No, no, no. He's
revealed himself.

1089
01:47:10,816 --> 01:47:12,442
Benji, can you pinpoint
Hendricks' location?

1090
01:47:13,652 --> 01:47:15,695
Hendricks is signaling
out of a state-run

1091
01:47:15,779 --> 01:47:17,655
TV station 6.7 miles from here.

1092
01:47:17,740 --> 01:47:18,781
Send me the coordinates.

1093
01:47:18,866 --> 01:47:20,533
Good work, Brandt. Now get
the hell out of there.

1094
01:47:20,618 --> 01:47:21,701
Back me up!

1095
01:47:21,785 --> 01:47:23,870
Jane, tie it off with Nath and
meet me at the rally point.

1096
01:47:29,793 --> 01:47:30,793
Sleep tight

1097
01:47:32,129 --> 01:47:34,005
Faster, Benji! Just
straight through!

1098
01:47:38,135 --> 01:47:39,510
Wait! Stop!

1099
01:47:39,595 --> 01:47:41,095
Take me through!

1100
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:44,182
It's not responding! A little bit
of patience would be appreciated!

1101
01:47:59,865 --> 01:48:01,741
I can't reach the top!

1102
01:48:03,661 --> 01:48:05,536
More fan! More fan!

1103
01:48:05,621 --> 01:48:06,996
More fan!

1104
01:48:07,081 --> 01:48:08,957
There's nothing I can do!
It's maxed out!

1105
01:48:26,350 --> 01:48:28,851
Brandt?

1106
01:48:30,396 --> 01:48:33,731
Next time, I get to
seduce the rich guy.

1107
01:48:44,535 --> 01:48:46,786
Satellite weaponized and online.

1108
01:48:46,870 --> 01:48:49,247
Upload the new
authentication codes.

1109
01:48:49,331 --> 01:48:51,291
Lock Russian Central
Command out of the system.

1110
01:48:51,709 --> 01:48:53,126
Isolate the sub.

1111
01:48:53,210 --> 01:48:57,880
We'll fire just one missile, an
apparent retaliation for the Kremlin.

1112
01:48:58,382 --> 01:49:00,174
That should start
the ball rolling.

1113
01:49:00,259 --> 01:49:01,342
I'm here, Ethan.

1114
01:49:01,427 --> 01:49:03,511
How long until Hendricks
can launch a missile?

1115
01:49:04,555 --> 01:49:05,805
Less than 30 seconds!

1116
01:49:07,599 --> 01:49:09,475
We need another route.

1117
01:49:10,561 --> 01:49:12,228
Turn left up ahead, take
the alley on the right.

1118
01:49:27,494 --> 01:49:28,494
We have uplink.

1119
01:49:39,214 --> 01:49:41,799
Ethan, Hendricks has started
the launch sequence.

1120
01:49:41,884 --> 01:49:43,551
How much time until
missiles are flying?

1121
01:49:43,635 --> 01:49:44,886
Three minutes!

1122
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:50,141
We're three and a
half minutes out.

1123
01:49:53,604 --> 01:49:57,440
We can make it.

1124
01:50:04,031 --> 01:50:05,031
Captain...

1125
01:50:09,828 --> 01:50:12,330
Connect to Central Command
for launch verification.

1126
01:50:12,414 --> 01:50:13,414
Right away.

1127
01:50:15,292 --> 01:50:18,002
Proceed with Operation
"Iron Fist".

1128
01:50:18,170 --> 01:50:19,962
Command to Launch is confirmed.

1129
01:50:20,339 --> 01:50:22,298
Cease all further communication.

1130
01:50:22,466 --> 01:50:23,466
Over and out.

1131
01:50:25,886 --> 01:50:27,095
Next left.

1132
01:50:40,567 --> 01:50:41,567
Proceed.

1133
01:51:02,881 --> 01:51:05,091
Ethan? We're too late.

1134
01:51:05,175 --> 01:51:07,176
The missile's in the air.

1135
01:51:19,565 --> 01:51:21,315
There has to be a way
to abort the warhead.

1136
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,151
If there is one, it'll
be on the launch device.

1137
01:51:23,235 --> 01:51:24,610
We're gonna get that case.

1138
01:51:35,289 --> 01:51:37,874
May there be peace on Earth.

1139
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,505
Disable the relay.

1140
01:51:45,883 --> 01:51:47,967
Get Wistrom! Inside, inside!

1141
01:52:22,461 --> 01:52:24,337
Wistrom destroyed the relay.

1142
01:52:24,421 --> 01:52:25,630
Ethan went after Hendricks
and the case, but...

1143
01:52:25,714 --> 01:52:27,924
Doesn't matter if he has the case.
We can't transmit the abort codes.

1144
01:52:28,258 --> 01:52:29,217
Can you fix it?

1145
01:52:29,301 --> 01:52:32,011
Yeah... It's gonna be pointless
if we don't have any power.

1146
01:52:32,095 --> 01:52:33,095
Wistrom!

1147
01:52:35,182 --> 01:52:36,849
- Jane!
- I'm okay.

1148
01:52:38,602 --> 01:52:40,895
No, you are not okay. She's hit.

1149
01:52:41,313 --> 01:52:42,897
You stay here and cover Benji.

1150
01:52:42,981 --> 01:52:45,983
Benji, get this thing rewired and
back online. I'll get the power on.

1151
01:52:46,068 --> 01:52:47,610
We can do this.

1152
01:56:02,013 --> 01:56:04,807
I'm taking that briefcase!

1153
01:56:08,353 --> 01:56:09,854
No! No!

1154
01:56:57,152 --> 01:56:58,611
He's been gone too long.

1155
01:56:58,695 --> 01:57:00,154
Damn it! Listen.

1156
01:57:00,238 --> 01:57:03,199
When the power comes on, these two
drives go into this bay, okay?

1157
01:57:47,202 --> 01:57:49,829
Mission accomplished!

1158
01:58:31,288 --> 01:58:32,538
Don't touch him!

1159
01:58:39,212 --> 01:58:41,046
This one is mine.

1160
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:55,978
So, we are not enemies.

1161
01:58:57,898 --> 01:59:00,608
The phone call from that
arms dealer in Dubai.

1162
01:59:00,901 --> 01:59:02,484
You wanted me to find you.

1163
01:59:06,531 --> 01:59:08,574
How else to believe this?

1164
01:59:16,207 --> 01:59:17,207
Hospital?

1165
01:59:19,461 --> 01:59:21,545
And in other news,
eight weeks later,

1166
01:59:21,630 --> 01:59:23,213
the debate continues.

1167
01:59:23,298 --> 01:59:27,635
Eyewitnesses remain adamant that the
object was some sort of aircraft,

1168
01:59:27,719 --> 01:59:31,555
but officials with the Department of
Defense insist it was simply a meteor

1169
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:34,350
large enough to be
visible during daylight.

1170
01:59:34,601 --> 01:59:36,518
You actually said that.

1171
01:59:36,853 --> 01:59:38,145
Out loud.

1172
01:59:38,772 --> 01:59:40,189
"Mission accomplished."

1173
01:59:40,273 --> 01:59:41,315
I said it.

1174
01:59:41,399 --> 01:59:43,943
You're still corny, Ethan.

1175
01:59:44,027 --> 01:59:46,862
I can't imagine the look
on that guy's face.

1176
01:59:48,657 --> 01:59:50,699
- Hey.
- This must be them.

1177
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:54,078
Luther Stickell, the firm
of Carter, Dunn and Brandt.

1178
01:59:55,705 --> 01:59:59,541
I blew an entire weekend on the
bottom of the San Francisco Bay

1179
02:00:00,669 --> 02:00:02,628
no thanks to you clowns.

1180
02:00:04,965 --> 02:00:06,548
No, man, you know I got this.

1181
02:00:07,550 --> 02:00:10,052
I know. I'll see
you in Kandahar.

1182
02:00:13,848 --> 02:00:15,975
Thanks for meeting me.

1183
02:00:16,059 --> 02:00:18,352
So, I hear the insurance
company's refusing

1184
02:00:18,436 --> 02:00:20,646
to pay the claim on that
car you crashed, Ethan.

1185
02:00:20,730 --> 02:00:24,358
Something about intentional 100-meter
vertical drops not being covered.

1186
02:00:24,442 --> 02:00:25,609
Go figure.

1187
02:00:29,197 --> 02:00:30,823
How's the leg?

1188
02:00:30,907 --> 02:00:32,157
Still working.

1189
02:00:33,076 --> 02:00:34,118
You?

1190
02:00:34,536 --> 02:00:35,744
Healing.

1191
02:00:37,622 --> 02:00:38,789
I'm fine, by the way.

1192
02:00:40,125 --> 02:00:41,792
I mean, I'm not actually
sleeping, per se.

1193
02:00:42,085 --> 02:00:44,920
You know. Cold sweats.
Middle of the night.

1194
02:00:46,589 --> 02:00:49,174
All these people are
just happy and smiling

1195
02:00:49,259 --> 02:00:51,010
and they are completely
oblivious to the fact

1196
02:00:51,094 --> 02:00:53,178
that they were almost vaporized.

1197
02:00:54,264 --> 02:00:55,889
And if it hadn't been for...

1198
02:00:55,974 --> 02:00:57,307
Dumb luck?

1199
02:00:57,767 --> 02:00:58,767
Was it?

1200
02:01:00,228 --> 02:01:03,731
I mean, look, we were
unprepared, in the dark.

1201
02:01:04,232 --> 02:01:05,566
Disavowed.

1202
02:01:06,776 --> 02:01:08,569
And the only thing that
functioned properly

1203
02:01:09,487 --> 02:01:11,030
on that mission

1204
02:01:11,948 --> 02:01:13,449
was this team.

1205
02:01:15,535 --> 02:01:18,120
I don't know how we
ended up together,

1206
02:01:19,914 --> 02:01:21,331
but I'm glad we did.

1207
02:01:28,798 --> 02:01:30,007
Your missions.

1208
02:01:30,967 --> 02:01:32,801
Choose to accept them.

1209
02:01:38,391 --> 02:01:40,059
Hey, look, I'm in.

1210
02:01:40,435 --> 02:01:42,019
Seriously. It's not
as if any mission

1211
02:01:42,103 --> 02:01:44,229
is gonna be rougher than
the last one, is it?

1212
02:01:45,648 --> 02:01:46,899
I mean, that's just...

1213
02:01:46,983 --> 02:01:48,650
Bomb... Is it?

1214
02:02:07,003 --> 02:02:08,337
Thanks, Ethan.

1215
02:02:08,671 --> 02:02:09,838
Thank you.

1216
02:02:11,841 --> 02:02:12,841
Agent Hunt.

1217
02:02:12,926 --> 02:02:14,301
Agent Carter.

1218
02:02:22,894 --> 02:02:23,936
Brandt.

1219
02:02:27,607 --> 02:02:29,108
I'm not picking up
that phone, Ethan,

1220
02:02:29,192 --> 02:02:31,819
because I don't think you
want me in the field.

1221
02:02:34,781 --> 02:02:36,740
I know your wife is dead.

1222
02:02:38,910 --> 02:02:41,120
I was there in Croatia.

1223
02:02:42,872 --> 02:02:44,331
I was there for one reason.

1224
02:02:44,415 --> 02:02:45,582
One.

1225
02:02:46,376 --> 02:02:47,835
And I failed.

1226
02:02:52,382 --> 02:02:53,966
It was my job to protect her.

1227
02:02:54,676 --> 02:02:56,135
How do you know she's dead?

1228
02:02:59,514 --> 02:03:00,556
There was a body.

1229
02:03:01,057 --> 02:03:02,266
Did you see it?

1230
02:03:05,979 --> 02:03:08,021
You killed those Serbians.

1231
02:03:08,106 --> 02:03:09,148
I had to get her back.

1232
02:03:09,232 --> 02:03:10,816
You were sent to Rankow Prison.

1233
02:03:10,900 --> 02:03:12,693
That was a sacrifice I
was willing to make.

1234
02:03:12,777 --> 02:03:15,571
IMF suspected Hendricks
had people in Rankow.

1235
02:03:18,283 --> 02:03:20,909
And six dead Serbians
was the ideal cover.

1236
02:03:22,787 --> 02:03:24,621
Waste not, want not.

1237
02:03:41,639 --> 02:03:43,765
The Secretary never told me.

1238
02:03:47,061 --> 02:03:50,898
I accepted the Rankow Prison
mission on one condition:

1239
02:03:50,982 --> 02:03:53,192
That no one could know
she was still alive.

1240
02:03:54,777 --> 02:03:57,070
But you're telling me.

1241
02:04:05,121 --> 02:04:07,706
When did you find out
that I was in Croatia?

1242
02:04:08,374 --> 02:04:10,334
I pulled your file after India.

1243
02:04:11,211 --> 02:04:12,419
Right.

1244
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:16,924
So you had to fake
your wife's death.

1245
02:04:17,759 --> 02:04:21,136
As long as we were together,
she could never be safe.

1246
02:04:22,096 --> 02:04:24,890
It wasn't your job to
protect her, Brandt.

1247
02:04:27,393 --> 02:04:28,644
It's mine.

1248
02:04:30,813 --> 02:04:31,939
Okay.

1249
02:04:35,902 --> 02:04:37,152
So we're good.

1250
02:04:38,488 --> 02:04:39,821
We're good.

1251
02:05:39,549 --> 02:05:41,300
Come on!

1252
02:06:01,321 --> 02:06:02,404
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

1253
02:06:02,488 --> 02:06:06,783
36 hours ago, there was a breach in
our military's communication network.

1254
02:06:06,909 --> 02:06:10,370
Now, an emerging terror
organization known as The Syndicate

1255
02:06:10,455 --> 02:06:14,124
has control of our entire drone fleet.
Their targets: Unknown.

1256
02:06:14,417 --> 02:06:17,127
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it...
