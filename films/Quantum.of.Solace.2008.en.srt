a lot of philanthropic work,

for ecological preserves.

As of this moment,

1053
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:03,527
my organization owns
more than 60% of
Bolivia's water supply.

1054
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:07,281
So this contract states
that your new government

1055
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:10,325
will use us as
utilities provider.

1056
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:13,245
This is double
what we are paying now.

1057
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:19,793
Well, then
don't sign it.

something about me and
the people I work with.

If the current president
had been more agreeable,

I wouldn't be
talking to you.

1063

So, if you decide
not to sign,

1064
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,149
you will wake up
with your balls
in your mouth

1065
