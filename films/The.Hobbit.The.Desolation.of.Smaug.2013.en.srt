1
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,247
I'm dying of thirst over here.
Come on! Come on!

2
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,804
- Here you are.
- Thank you kindly.

3
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,241
- Oh, watch it!
- Sorry, darling.

4
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,841
- There you are.
- Thank you.

5
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,530
Master Stadle.

6
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,050
Mind if I join you?

7
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,010
I'll have the same.

8
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,371
I should introduce myself.
My name is Gandalf.

9
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,086
Gandalf the Grey.

10
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,324
I know who you are.

11
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,843
Well, now. This is a fine chance.

12
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,726
What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?

13
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,250
I received word that my father...

14
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,200
...had been seen wandering...

15
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,248
...the Wilds near Dunland.

16
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,165
I went looking.

17
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,411
I found no sign of him.

18
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,009
Thrain.

19
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,882
You're like the others.

20
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,491
You think he is dead.

21
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,247
I was not at the Battle of Moria.

22
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,084
No...

23
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,088
...but I was.

24
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,005
<i>My grandfather...</i>

25
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
<i>...Thror...</i>

26
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
<i>...was slain.</i>

27
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
No!

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,649
Father.

29
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,483
Stay back.

30
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,210
No. I will fight with you.

31
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,847
Azog means to kill us all.

32
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,326
One by one, he will destroy
the line of Durin.

33
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,121
But by mine's life, he
shall not take my son.

34
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,640
You will stay here.

35
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,645
<i>My father led a charge
towards the Dimrill Gate.</i>

36
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
<i>He never returned.</i>

37
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Father!

38
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,648
<i>"Thrain is gone, " they told me.</i>

39
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,326
<i>"He is one of the fallen."</i>

40
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,681
<i>But at the end of that battle,
I searched amongst the slain.</i>

41
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,082
<i>To the last body.</i>

42
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,567
My father was not among the dead.

43
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,609
Thorin, it's been a long time...

44
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,729
...since anything but rumor was heard...

45
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
...of Thrain.

46
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,683
He still lives.

47
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,445
I am sure of it.

48
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,121
The ring your grandfather wore,
one of the seven...

49
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,930
...given the Dwarf-lords...

50
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,810
...many years ago...

51
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,083
...what became of it?

52
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,642
He gave it to my father
before they went into battle.

53
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,724
So Thrain was wearing it when he...

54
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,361
When he went missing.

55
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,687
Mm.

56
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,764
- That's that, then.
- There you are.

57
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,730
My father came to see you...

58
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,640
...before the Battle of Moria.

59
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,331
What did you say to him?

60
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,962
I urged him to march upon Erebor,
to rally...

61
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,083
...the seven armies of the Dwarves...

62
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,243
...to destroy the dragon and take back...

63
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,130
...the Lonely Mountain.

64
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,283
And I would say the same to you.

65
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,526
Take back your homeland.

66
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,529
This is no chance meeting,
is it, Gandalf?

67
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,721
No.

68
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,011
It is not.

69
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,970
The Lonely Mountain troubles me...

70
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,886
...Thorin. That dragon
has sat there long enough.

71
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,167
Sooner or later...

72
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,444
...darker minds will turn towards Erebor.

73
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,446
I ran into some unsavory characters...

74
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,967
...whilst traveling on the Greenway.

75
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,971
They mistook me for a vagabond.

76
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,446
I imagine they regretted that.

77
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,126
One of them was carrying a message.

78
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,930
It is Black Speech.

79
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,850
A promise of payment.

80
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,281
For what?

81
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,167
Your head.

82
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,323
Someone wants you dead.

83
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,803
Thorin, you can wait no longer.
You are...

84
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,724
...the heir to the Throne of Durin.

85
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,409
Unite the armies of the Dwarves.

86
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,768
Together, you have the might and power...

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,923
...to retake Erebor.

88
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,442
Summon a meeting
of the seven Dwarf families.

89
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,409
Demand they stand by their oath.

90
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,571
The seven armies swore that oath
to the one who wields the King's Jewel.

91
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,847
The Arkenstone.

92
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,840
It is the only thing that will...

93
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,485
...unite them,
and in case you have forgotten...

94
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,007
...that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

95
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,925
What if I were to help you reclaim it?

96
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,727
How?

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,002
The Arkenstone lies half a world away...

98
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,766
...buried beneath the feet
of a fire-breathing dragon.

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,161
Yes, it does.

100
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,086
Which is why we're going to need a burglar.

101
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,080
How close is the pack?

102
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,801
Too close. A couple of leagues, no more.
But that's not the worst of it.

103
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,640
- Have the Wargs picked up our scent?
- Not yet. But they will do.

104
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,121
- We have another problem.
- Did they see you?

105
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,963
They saw you.

106
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
No, that's not it.

107
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,202
What did I tell you?

108
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,771
Quiet as a mouse.

109
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,046
Excellent burglar material.

110
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,600
Will you listen? Will you just...

111
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,921
...listen?

112
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,400
I'm trying to tell you
there is something else out there.

113
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,841
What form did it take?

114
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,561
Like a bear?

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,490
Ye... Yes, but bigger.

116
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,801
Much bigger.

117
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,886
You knew about this beast?

118
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,926
I say we double back.

119
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,282
And be run down by a pack of Orcs?

120
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,250
There is a house...

121
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,971
...it's not far from here,
where we might take refuge.

122
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,440
Whose house?

123
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,926
Are they friend or foe?

124
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,451
Neither.

125
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,408
He will help us or...

126
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,565
...he will kill us.

127
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,044
What choice do we have?

128
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,761
None.

129
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,530
Come on!

130
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,609
This way! Quickly!

131
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Run!

132
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,445
Bombur, come on!

133
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,730
To the house!

134
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,321
Run!

135
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,165
Come on, get inside.

136
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,881
Open the door!

137
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,286
Quickly!

138
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,323
- Push!
- Push!

139
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,843
Dwalin!

140
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Come on, lads!

141
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,563
What is...

142
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
...that?

143
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,124
That is our host.

144
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,882
His name is Beorn.

145
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,287
And he's a skin-changer.

146
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,928
Sometimes he's a huge black bear.

147
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,681
Sometimes he's a great strong man.

148
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,042
The bear is unpredictable...

149
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,487
...but the man can be reasoned with.
However...

150
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,969
...he is not overfond of Dwarves.

151
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,120
He's leaving.

152
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,328
Come away from there.

153
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,046
It's not natural. None of it.

154
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,248
It's obvious. He's under some...

155
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,520
...dark spell.

156
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,681
Don't be a fool.

157
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,321
He's under no enchantment but his own.

158
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,770
All right, now get some sleep. All of you.

159
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,367
You'll be safe here tonight.

160
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,209
I hope.

161
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,681
Don't blame me!

162
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,371
Come on, Dori!

163
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,286
Well, I say we should leg it.
Slip out the back way.

164
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,530
I'm not running from anyone, beast or no.

165
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,091
There is no point in arguing.

166
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,402
We cannot pass...

167
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,480
...through the Wilderland
without Beorn's help.

168
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,569
We'll be hunted down
before we ever get to the forest.

169
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,006
Ah, Bilbo.

170
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
There you are.

171
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,923
Now...

172
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,170
...this will require
some delicate handling.

173
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,448
We must tread very carefully.

174
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,685
The last person to have startled him
was torn to shreds.

175
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I will go first and...

176
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,320
Uh, Bilbo?

177
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,289
You come with me.

178
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,166
- Is this a good idea?
- Yes.

179
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,687
Now, the rest of you, you just wait here...

180
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,491
...and don't come out until I
give the signal. BOFUR: Right.

181
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,960
Wait for the signal.

182
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,522
And no sudden moves or loud noises,
and don't overcrowd him.

183
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,081
And only come out in pairs. Right.

184
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,885
No, actually, Bombur...

185
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,522
...um, you count as two
so you should come out alone.

186
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,807
Mm.

187
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,606
Remember, wait for the signal.

188
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,525
The signal. Right.

189
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,800
What signal would that be?

190
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,080
- Ahem.
- You're nervous.

191
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,569
Nervous? What nonsense.

192
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Good morning.

193
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,369
Good morning!

194
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,645
Who are you?

195
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,680
I'm Gandalf. Gandalf the Grey.

196
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,409
Never heard of him.

197
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,721
I'm a Wizard.

198
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,845
Perhaps you've heard of my colleague
Radagast the Brown.

199
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,084
He resides in the southern borders
of Mirkwood.

200
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,448
What do you want?

201
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,241
Well, simply to thank you
for your hospitality.

202
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,240
You may have noticed that we took refuge...

203
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,164
...in your lodgings here last night.

204
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,443
Who is this...

205
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
...little fellow?

206
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,287
Well, this would be Mr. Baggins...

207
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,567
...from the Shire.

208
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,961
He's not a Dwarf, is he?

209
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,330
Why, no. No, he's a Hobbit.

210
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,481
A good family
and unimpeachable reputation.

211
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,122
A Halfling and a Wizard.

212
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,280
How come you here?

213
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,203
Oh, well, the fact is...

214
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,681
...that we've had a bad time of it...

215
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,764
...from Goblins in the mountains.

216
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,365
What did you go near Goblins for?

217
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,130
Stupid thing to do.

218
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,606
You are absolutely...

219
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,921
...right. No, it...
- There it is. Go.

220
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,447
- Go.
- ...was terrible.

221
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,202
Dwalin...

222
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
...and Balin.

223
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,846
And I must...

224
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,088
...confess that, uh, several...

225
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,608
...of our group are, in fact, Dwarves.

226
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,247
Do you call two...

227
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,721
... "several"?

228
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,531
Well, uh, now you put it that way...

229
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,080
Yes, there could be more...

230
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,327
...than two.

231
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
Go, go.

232
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Wait, that's us.

233
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,967
Oh, and here are some more...

234
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,964
...of our, uh, happy troop.

235
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,407
And do you call six a "troop"?

236
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,881
What are you, a traveling circus?

237
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,728
Go.

238
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,041
Go. Go, go.

239
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,767
Dori and Ori at your service.

240
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,609
I don't...

241
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,840
...want your service.

242
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,160
Absolutely understandable.

243
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,083
Go.

244
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Go.

245
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,764
Oh, Fili and Kili. I'd
quite forgotten. Yes.

246
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,241
Oh, yes, and Nori, Bofur...

247
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,209
...Bifur...

248
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,330
...and Bombur.

249
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,084
Is that it?

250
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,405
Are there any more?

251
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,767
Ah.

252
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,446
So you are the one they call Oakenshield.

253
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,451
Tell me...

254
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,120
...why is Azog...

255
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,248
...the Defiler hunting you?

256
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,285
You know of Azog?

257
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,280
How?

258
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,324
My people were the first to live
in the mountains...

259
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,286
...before the Orcs came down
from the North.

260
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,643
The Defiler killed most of my family.

261
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,320
But some he...

262
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,481
...enslaved.

263
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,645
Not for work, you understand...

264
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,325
...but for sport.

265
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,727
Caging skin-changers...

266
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,760
...and torturing them
seemed to amuse him.

267
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,805
There are others like you?

268
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,885
Once there were many.

269
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
And now?

270
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,209
Now there is only one.

271
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,966
You need to reach...

272
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,886
...the mountain before
the last days of autumn.

273
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,246
Before Durin's Day falls.

274
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Yes.

275
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,570
You are running out of time.

276
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,007
Which is why we must
go through Mirkwood.

277
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,050
A darkness lies upon that forest.

278
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,329
Fell things creep beneath those trees.

279
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,763
I would not venture there...

280
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,843
...except in great need.

281
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,082
We will take the Elven Road.

282
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
That path is still safe.

283
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,641
"Safe"?

284
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,491
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood...

285
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,760
...are not like their kin.

286
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,765
They're less wise...

287
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,929
...and more dangerous.

288
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,964
But it matters not.

289
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,961
What do you mean?

290
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,965
These lands are crawling with Orcs.

291
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,405
Their numbers are growing.

292
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,125
And you are on foot.

293
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
You will never reach...

294
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,288
...the forest alive.

295
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,081
I don't like Dwarves.

296
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,764
They're greedy...

297
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,481
...and blind.

298
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,849
Blind to the lives of those they deem...

299
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,566
...lesser than their own.

300
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,441
But Orcs I hate more.

301
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,930
What do you need?

302
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,729
You will leave my...

303
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,564
...ponies before you enter the forest.

304
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,529
Oh, you have my word.

305
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,886
We're being watched.

306
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,246
Yes.

307
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,727
The Orcs will not give up.

308
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,930
They will hunt the Dwarves
until they see them destroyed.

309
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,931
Why now? What has made
the Defiler crawl from his hole?

310
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,885
There is an alliance
between the Orcs of Moria...

311
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,162
...and the sorcerer in Dol Guldur.

312
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,400
Are you sure of this?

313
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,607
Packs have been seen...

314
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,524
...gathering there.

315
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,161
Each day, more and more come.

316
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,968
What do you know of this sorcerer?

317
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,487
The one they call the Necromancer.

318
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,646
I know he is not what he seems.

319
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,804
Fell things are drawn to his power.

320
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,246
Azog pays...

321
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,965
...homage to him.

322
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,486
Gandalf.

323
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,287
Time is wasting.

324
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,528
There is more.

325
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,967
Not long past, word spread...

326
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,245
...the dead had been seen
walking near the High Fells of Rhudaur.

327
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
The dead?

328
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,130
Is it true?

329
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,170
Are there tombs in those mountains?

330
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,768
<i>When</i> Angmar fell...

331
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,362
<i>...the Men of the North took his body
and all that he possessed...</i>

332
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,560
<i>...and sealed it within
the High Fells of Rhudaur.</i>

333
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,410
<i>Deep within the rock, they buried him.</i>

334
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,200
<i>In a tomb so dark...</i>

335
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,609
<i>...it would never...</i>

336
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,887
<i>...come to light.</i>

337
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
Yes.

338
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,847
Yes, there are tombs up there.

339
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,520
I remember a time when a great evil...

340
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,967
...ruled these lands.

341
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
One powerful...

342
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,728
...enough to raise the dead.

343
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,649
If that enemy has returned
to Middle-earth...

344
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,287
...I would have you tell me.

345
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,161
Saruman the White says it's not possible.

346
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,246
The enemy was destroyed
and will never return.

347
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,248
And what does...

348
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,005
...Gandalf the Grey say?

349
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,690
Go now.

350
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,568
While you have the light.

351
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,209
Your hunters are not far behind.

352
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,721
The Elven Gate.

353
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,205
Here lies our path...

354
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,970
...through Mirkwood.

355
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,369
No sign of the Orcs.
We have luck on our side.

356
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,728
Set the ponies loose.

357
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,806
Let them return to their master.

358
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
This forest...

359
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,331
...feels...

360
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,041
...sick.

361
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,727
As if a disease lies upon it.

362
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,844
Is there no way around?

363
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,560
Not unless we go 200 miles north.

364
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,882
Or twice that distance...

365
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,126
...south.

366
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,403
<i>Something moves in the shadows unseen...</i>

367
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,240
<i>...hidden from our sight.</i>

368
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,284
<i>Every day it grows in strength.</i>

369
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,886
<i>Beware the Necromancer.</i>

370
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,522
<i>He is not what he seems.</i>

371
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,527
<i>If our Enemy has returned,
we must know.</i>

372
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,644
<i>Go to the tombs in the mountains.</i>

373
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,562
The High Fells.

374
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,005
So be it.

375
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,928
Not my horse!

376
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
I need it!

377
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,366
You're not leaving us?

378
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,364
I would not do this unless I had to.

379
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,286
You've changed...

380
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,289
...Bilbo Baggins.

381
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,729
You're not the same Hobbit
as the one who left the Shire.

382
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,210
I was going to tell you.

383
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,926
I...

384
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,882
...found something in the Goblin tunnels.

385
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,491
Found what?

386
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,083
What did you find?

387
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,800
My courage.

388
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,648
Good. Well, that's good.

389
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,289
You'll need it.

390
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,171
I'll be waiting for you
at the overlook, before...

391
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,566
...the slopes of Erebor.

392
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,167
Keep the map and key safe.

393
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,410
Do not enter that mountain without me.

394
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,563
This is not the Greenwood of old.

395
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,128
There is a stream in the woods
that carries a dark enchantment.

396
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,283
Do not touch the water.

397
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,921
Cross only by the stone bridge.

398
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,766
The very air of the forest
is heavy with illusion.

399
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,731
It'll seek to enter your mind
and lead you astray.

400
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,889
"Lead us astray"?

401
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,685
What does that mean?

402
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,169
You must stay on the path.
Do not leave it.

403
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,642
If you do, you'll never...

404
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,166
...find it again.

405
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,410
No matter what may come, stay on...

406
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,323
...the path!

407
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,723
Come on. We must reach the mountain
before the sun sets on Durin's Day.

408
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,961
- Durin's Day?
- Let's go.

409
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,720
It is our one chance
to find the hidden door.

410
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,130
The path turns this way.

411
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,366
This way.

412
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,123
Air. I need air.

413
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,408
My head, it's swimming!

414
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,610
- We found the bridge.
- Bridge.

415
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,481
Oh.

416
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,963
We could try and swim it.

417
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,487
Didn't you hear what Gandalf said?

418
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,769
A dark magic lies upon this forest.

419
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,449
The waters of this stream are enchanted.

420
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,531
Doesn't look very enchanting to me.

421
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,525
We must find another way across.

422
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,969
These vines look strong enough.

423
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,884
Kili!

424
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,009
We send the lightest first.

425
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,284
It's all right.

426
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,890
Can't see any problem.

427
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,406
There's one.

428
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,243
Everything's...

429
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,084
...fine.

430
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,371
Something is not right.

431
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,170
This is not right at all.

432
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,687
Stay where you are! Oh.

433
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,290
I can't get a grip.

434
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,484
What are you doing?

435
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,487
You shouldn't have done that.

436
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
It's bad luck.

437
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,045
I don't believe in luck.

438
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,370
We make our own luck.

439
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,361
We need...

440
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,523
...to take a rest.

441
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,400
What is that?

442
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,769
Those voices.

443
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,606
Can you hear them?

444
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,530
I hear nothing.

445
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,686
No wind...

446
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,121
...no birds.

447
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,564
What hour is it?

448
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,485
I do not know.

449
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
I do not even...

450
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,280
...know what day it is.

451
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,083
This is taking too long.

452
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,086
Is there no end to this...

453
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,761
...accursed forest?

454
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,286
None that I can see.

455
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,166
Only trees and more trees.

456
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,250
This way.

457
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,443
- Gandalf said...
- Do as I say. Follow me.

458
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,007
Attercop.

459
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,403
No, no, wait.

460
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,843
Wait.

461
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,244
Stop.

462
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,484
We can't leave the pa...

463
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,122
We must stay on the path.

464
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,127
I don't remember this bit.

465
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,004
None of it's familiar.

466
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,009
It's got to be here.

467
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,610
It can't have just disappeared.

468
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,241
Unless someone's moved it.

469
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,847
It's not over here neither.

470
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,760
Look.

471
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,610
A tobacco pouch.

472
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,286
There's Dwarves in these woods.

473
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,171
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains,
no less.

474
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,050
This is exactly the same as mine.

475
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,971
Because it is yours. Do you understand?

476
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,049
We're going around in circles.
We are lost.

477
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,328
We are not lost. We keep heading east.

478
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,211
But which way is east? We've lost the sun.

479
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,920
I thought you were the expert.

480
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,961
The sun.

481
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,444
We have to find...

482
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,960
...the sun.

483
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,961
Up there.

484
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,200
We need to...

485
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,805
...get above the canopy.

486
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,723
What was that?

487
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,810
Enough! Quiet! All of you!

488
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,524
We're being watched.

489
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,684
I can see a lake!

490
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,682
And a river.

491
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,050
And the Lonely Mountain.

492
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,289
We're almost there!

493
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,531
Can you hear me?

494
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,962
I know which way to go!

495
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,406
Hello?

496
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,966
Hello.

497
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,040
Oh, no.

498
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,240
Oh, come on.

499
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,931
Kill them! Kill them.

500
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,208
Eat them now,
while their blood is running.

501
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,962
Their hide is tough,
but there's good juice inside.

502
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,849
Stick it again.

503
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,128
Stick it again. Finish it off.

504
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,009
The meat's alive and kicking!

505
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,849
Kill him.

506
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,842
Kill him now.

507
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,684
Let us feast.

508
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,160
Feast! Feast!

509
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,482
Feast! Feast!

510
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,285
Eat them alive!

511
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,568
Feast!

512
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,803
- What is it?
- What is it?

513
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,887
Eat them alive!

514
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,248
Fat and juicy.

515
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,731
Just a...

516
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,041
...little taste.

517
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,087
Curse it! Where is it?! Where is it?!

518
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,566
Here.

519
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,443
Ah! It stings!

520
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,680
It stings!

521
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,851
Sting.

522
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,086
That's a good name.

523
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,006
Sting.

524
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,124
You all right there, Bofur?

525
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,760
- I'm all right!
- Get it off me!

526
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,046
Where's Bilbo?

527
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,280
I'm up here!

528
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,600
Grab the legs!

529
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,440
Pull!

530
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,401
Pull!

531
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,767
Where is it? Where is it? Come on.

532
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,641
Where is it?

533
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,800
No!

534
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,486
No! No!

535
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,688
Thorin! Get them!

536
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,920
Come on!

537
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,124
Look out, brother!

538
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,880
Fili!

539
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,651
Mine.

540
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,643
Come on...

541
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,041
...keep up!

542
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,926
We're clear!

543
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,241
Do not think I won't kill you, Dwarf.

544
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,164
It would be my pleasure.

545
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,450
- Help!
- Kili!

546
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,641
Throw me a dagger!

547
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,561
Quick!

548
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:34,883
If you think I'm giving you...

549
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,201
...a weapon, Dwarf...

550
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,521
...you're mistaken!

551
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,045
Search them.

552
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,648
B'ey! Give it back! That's private!

553
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,081
Who is this?

554
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,845
- Your brother?
- That is...

555
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,366
...my wife!

556
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,722
And what is this horrid creature?

557
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,126
A Goblin-mutant?

558
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,283
That's my wee lad, Gimli.

559
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,600
Where did you get this?

560
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,166
It was given to me.

561
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,008
Not just a thief, but a liar as well.

562
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,285
Thorin, where's Bilbo?

563
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,002
Unh! This is not the end of it!

564
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,525
- Do you hear me?!
- Hey, let us out of here!

565
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,325
Get off me!

566
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,725
Aren't you going to search me?

567
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,567
I could have anything down my trousers.

568
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,964
Or nothing.

569
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,720
- Again!
- Leave it!

570
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,811
There's no way out!

571
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,042
This is no Orc dungeon.

572
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,800
These are the Halls
of the Woodland Realm.

573
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,880
No one leaves here
but by the king's consent.

574
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,121
Some may imagine
that a noble quest is at hand.

575
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,604
A quest to reclaim a homeland...

576
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,609
...and slay a dragon.

577
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,005
I myself suspect a more prosaic motive.

578
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,530
Attempted burglary.

579
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,567
Or something of that ilk.

580
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,482
You have found...

581
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,721
...a way in.

582
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,080
You seek that which would...

583
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,164
...bestow upon you the right to rule.

584
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,729
The King's Jewel.

585
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,130
The Arkenstone.

586
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,722
It is precious to you beyond measure.

587
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,449
I understand that.

588
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,041
There are gems in the mountain
that I too desire.

589
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,361
White gems...

590
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,648
...of pure starlight.

591
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,967
I offer you my help.

592
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,525
I am listening.

593
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,404
I will let you go...

594
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,085
...if you but return what is mine.

595
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,611
A favor for a favor.

596
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,920
You have my word.

597
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,726
One king to another.

598
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,123
I would not trust Thranduil...

599
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,160
...the great king...

600
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,521
...to honor his word...

601
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,286
...should the end of all days
be upon us!

602
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,920
You...

603
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
...who lack all...

604
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,201
...honor!

605
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,328
I have seen how you treat your friends.

606
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,641
We came to you once,
starving, homeless...

607
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,325
...seeking your help.

608
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,247
But you turned your back!

609
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,167
You turned away from
the suffering of my people...

610
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,408
...and the inferno that destroyed us.

611
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,082
Do not talk to me of dragon fire.

612
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,129
I know...

613
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,641
...its wrath and ruin.

614
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,006
I have faced...

615
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,045
...the great serpents of the North.

616
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:19,849
I warned your...

617
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,408
...grandfather of what his greed
would summon.

618
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,883
But he would not listen.

619
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,488
You are just like him.

620
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,724
Stay here if you will...

621
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,530
...and rot.

622
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,683
A hundred years is a mere blink...

623
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,922
...in the life of an Elf.

624
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,844
I'm patient.

625
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,882
I can wait.

626
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,441
Did he offer you a deal?

627
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,841
He did.

628
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,927
I told him he could go
ish <i>kakhfé</i> ai-'d dur-rugnu!

629
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,680
Him and all his kin!

630
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,284
Well, that's that, then.

631
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,480
A deal was our only hope.

632
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,689
Not our only hope.

633
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,971
I know you're there.

634
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,764
Why do you linger in the shadows?

635
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,161
I was coming to report to you.

636
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,688
I thought I ordered that nest
to be destroyed not two moons past.

637
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,603
We cleared...

638
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,320
...the forest as ordered, my lord.
But more spiders keep...

639
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,680
...coming up from the South.

640
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,523
They are spawning in...

641
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,047
...the ruins of Dol Guldur.
If we could kill them at their source...

642
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,488
That fortress lies beyond our borders.

643
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,525
Keep our lands clear of those
foul creatures. That is your task.

644
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,406
And when we drive them off, what then?

645
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,250
Will they not spread to other lands?

646
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,364
Other lands are not my concern.

647
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,446
The fortunes of the world...

648
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,761
...will rise and fall.

649
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
But here in this...

650
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,240
...kingdom, we will endure.

651
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,200
Legolas said you fought well today.

652
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,249
He has grown very fond of you.

653
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,924
I assure you, my lord...

654
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,130
...Legolas thinks of me as
no more than a captain of the guard.

655
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,203
Perhaps he did once.

656
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,766
Now I am not so sure.

657
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,641
I do not think you would allow your son...

658
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,326
...to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.

659
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,171
No, you are right. I would not.

660
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,207
Still, he cares about you.

661
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,566
Do not give him hope where there is none.

662
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,003
The stone in your hand, what is it?

663
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,965
It is a talisman.

664
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,805
A powerful spell lies upon it.

665
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,765
If any but a Dwarf
reads the runes on this stone...

666
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,840
...they will be forever cursed.

667
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,200
Or not.

668
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,800
Depending on whether you believe
in that kind of thing. It's just a token.

669
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,006
A rune stone.

670
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:06,763
My mother...

671
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,923
...gave it to me
so I'd remember my promise.

672
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,046
What promise?

673
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,925
That I would come back to her.

674
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,080
She worries.

675
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,090
She thinks I'm reckless.

676
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,926
Are you?

677
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,760
Nah.

678
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,450
Sounds like quite a party...

679
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,085
...you're having up there.

680
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,768
<i>It is Mereth e-nGilith...</i>

681
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,205
...the Feast of Starlight.

682
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,841
All light is sacred to the Eldar.

683
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,888
But Wood Elves love best
the light of the stars.

684
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,050
I always thought it is a cold light.

685
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,441
Remote and far away.

686
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,524
It is memory...

687
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,449
...precious and pure.

688
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,451
Like your promise.

689
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,769
I have walked there sometimes.

690
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,880
Beyond the forest...

691
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,445
...and up into the night.

692
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,044
I have seen the world fall away...

693
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:35,090
...and the white light
of forever fill the air.

694
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,369
I saw a fire moon once.

695
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,931
It rose over the pass near Dunland. Huge.

696
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,766
Red and gold, it was. It filled the sky.

697
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,570
We were an escort for some merchants
from Ered Luin. They were...

698
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,963
...trading in silverwork for furs.
We took the Greenway south...

699
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,488
...keeping the mountain to our left.

700
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,450
And then it appeared.

701
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,729
This huge fire moon...

702
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,810
...lighting our path.

703
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,327
I wish I could show you the caverns.

704
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,245
Galion, you old rogue,
we're running out of drink.

705
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,889
These empty barrels should have been
sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.

706
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,168
The bargeman will be waiting for them.

707
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,640
Say what you like about our...

708
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:22,082
...ill-tempered king.
He has excellent taste in wine.

709
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,605
<i>Come, Elros, try it.</i>

710
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,320
I have the Dwarves...

711
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,401
...in my charge.

712
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,724
They're locked up.
Where can they go? Ha, ha.

713
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,371
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.

714
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,329
Must be nearly dawn.

715
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,881
We're never gonna reach
the mountain, are we?

716
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,922
Not stuck in here, you're not.

717
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,529
Bilbo!

718
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,760
What?

719
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,131
Shh! There are guards nearby!

720
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:04,802
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Close the doors.

721
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,247
- It'll buy us more time.
- All right, Nori.

722
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,640
- Up the stairs.
- You first.

723
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,363
Ori.

724
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,240
Not that way. Down here. Follow me.

725
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,440
Go.

726
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,045
Easy, now.

727
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,201
This way.

728
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,087
Come on.

729
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,000
I don't believe it. We're in the cellars!

730
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,929
You were supposed to be leading us out,
not further in!

731
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:50,883
I know what I'm doing!

732
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,160
Shh!

733
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,124
This way! This way!

734
00:59:59,120 --> 00:59:59,723
Everyone...

735
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,241
- ...climb into the barrels quickly.
- Are you mad?

736
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,123
- They'll find us.
- No, no.

737
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,407
They won't, I promise you.

738
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,167
Please, please. You must trust me.

739
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,121
Do as he says.

740
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,560
Move your big ginger head.

741
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,249
Bifur, get in...

742
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,443
...the barrel! Move!

743
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,810
Everyone’s in.

744
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,849
What do we do now?

745
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,601
Hold your breath.

746
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,400
Hold my breath? What do you mean?

747
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,045
Where is the Keeper of the Keys?

748
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,406
Well done, Master Baggins.

749
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,121
Go! Come on, let's go!

750
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,770
Hold on!

751
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,331
Bilbo!

752
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,160
Hang on!

753
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,087
- Help!
- Ori!

754
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,800
No!

755
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,924
Watch out! There's Orcs!

756
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:14,920
Get under the bridge!

757
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,560
Kili!

758
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,480
Kili!

759
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,240
Kili.

760
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:56,920
Kili!

761
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,966
Nori!

762
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:35,841
Cut the log!

763
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:44,920
Bombur!

764
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,400
Tauriel.

765
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,281
Oh, it's you!

766
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,131
Why am I here, Gandalf?

767
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,566
Trust me, Radagast.

768
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,770
I would not have called you here
without good reason.

769
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,891
This is not a nice place to meet.

770
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,246
No.

771
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,690
It is not.

772
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,286
These are dark spells, Gandalf.

773
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,245
Old and full of hate.

774
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,851
Who's buried here?

775
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,568
If he had a name,
it's long since been lost.

776
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,882
He would have been known only...

777
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,441
...as a servant of evil.

778
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,968
One of a number.

779
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,043
One of nine.

780
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,202
Why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.

781
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,043
The Ringwraiths...

782
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,089
...have been summoned to Dol Guldur.

783
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,288
But it cannot be the Necromancer.

784
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,047
A human sorcerer
could not summon such evil.

785
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,248
Who said it was human?

786
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,561
The Nine only answer to one master.

787
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,406
We've been blind, Radagast.

788
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,722
And in our blindness...

789
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,088
...the Enemy has returned.

790
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,722
He is summoning his servants.

791
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,124
Azog the Defiler...

792
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,363
...is no ordinary hunter.

793
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,931
He is a commander.

794
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,722
A commander of legions.

795
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:52,171
The Enemy is preparing for war.

796
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,530
It will begin in the East.

797
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,571
His mind is set upon that mountain.

798
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,683
- Where are you going?
- To rejoin the others.

799
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:00,920
Gandalf.

800
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,805
I started this. I cannot forsake them.

801
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,963
They are in grave danger.

802
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,486
If what you say is true...

803
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,451
...the world is in grave danger.

804
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:16,121
The power in that fortress
will only grow stronger.

805
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,569
You want me to cast my friends aside?

806
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,881
- Anything behind us?
- Not that I can see.

807
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,360
I think we've outrun the Orcs.
Not for long. We've lost the current.

808
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,329
Bombur's half drowned.

809
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,649
- Make for the shore!
- Aye.

810
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:39,920
Come on, let's go!

811
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,889
Gloin, help me, my brother.

812
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,089
Come on, lift yourself.

813
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,681
Come on!

814
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,366
Come on, you big lump, you!

815
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,209
I'm fine. It's nothing.

816
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:03,440
On your feet.

817
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,648
Kili's wounded. His leg needs binding.

818
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,281
There's an Orc pack on our tail.
We keep moving.

819
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,520
To where?

820
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,603
To the mountain. We're so close.

821
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,090
A lake lies between us and that mountain.

822
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,607
- We have no way to cross it.
- So then we go around.

823
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,850
The Orcs will run us down,
as sure as daylight.

824
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,162
We've no weapons to defend ourselves.

825
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,084
Bind his leg, quickly.

826
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,170
You have two minutes.

827
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,480
Do it again...

828
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,281
...and you're dead.

829
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,206
Excuse me...

830
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:57,569
...but you're from Lake-town,
if I'm not mistaken.

831
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,046
That barge over there...

832
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:04,568
...it wouldn't be available for hire,
by any chance?

833
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,322
What makes you think I would help you?

834
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,409
Those boots have seen better days.

835
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,570
As has that coat.

836
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,608
No doubt you have
some hungry mouths to feed.

837
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,131
How many bairns?

838
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,690
A boy and two girls.

839
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,251
And your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.

840
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,601
Aye.

841
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,121
She was.

842
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,850
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

843
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,963
Oh, come on, come on.
Enough of the niceties.

844
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,766
What's your hurry?

845
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,246
What's it to you?

846
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,164
I would like to know who you are...

847
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,040
...and what you are doing in these lands.

848
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,686
We are simple merchants
from the Blue Mountains...

849
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,485
...journeying to see our kin...

850
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,330
...in the Iron Hills.

851
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,688
Simple merchants, you say?

852
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,251
We need food...

853
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,488
...supplies, weapons.

854
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:58,881
Can you help us?

855
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,049
I know where these...

856
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,685
...barrels came from.

857
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,680
What of it?

858
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,366
I don't know what business you had
with the Elves...

859
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,609
...but I don't think it ended well.

860
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:14,963
No one enters Lake-town...

861
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,168
...but by leave of the Master.

862
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,565
All his wealth comes from trade
with the Woodland Realm.

863
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,605
He would see you in irons before
risking the wrath of King Thranduil.

864
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,520
Offer him more.

865
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,083
I'll wager there are...

866
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,243
...ways to enter that town unseen.

867
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,201
Aye.

868
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,800
But for that...

869
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,411
...you would need a smuggler.

870
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,563
For which we would pay double.

871
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:53,727
Such is the nature of evil.
Out there in...

872
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,564
...the vast ignorance of the world...

873
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,121
...it festers and spreads.

874
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:01,091
A shadow that grows in the dark.

875
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,409
A sleepless malice as black...

876
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,564
...as the oncoming wall of night.

877
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,450
So it ever was.

878
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,248
So will it always be.

879
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,201
In time, all foul things come forth.

880
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,410
You were tracking a company of 13 Dwarves.

881
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,640
Why?

882
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,171
Not 13.

883
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,965
Not anymore.

884
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:26,680
The young one...

885
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,203
...the black-haired archer...

886
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,642
...we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.

887
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:36,449
The poison's in his blood. He'll be...

888
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,727
...choking on it soon.

889
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,329
Answer the question, filth.

890
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,449
I would not antagonize her.

891
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,849
You like killing things, Orc?

892
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,525
You like death?

893
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:54,960
Then let me give it to you.

894
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,440
I do not care about one...

895
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,325
...dead Dwarf. Answer the question.

896
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,889
You have nothing to fear. Tell us...

897
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,640
...what you know
and I will set you free.

898
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,601
You had orders to kill them. Why?

899
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,042
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

900
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,170
The Dwarf runt will never be king.

901
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,400
King?

902
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:34,643
There is no King Under the Mountain,
nor will there ever be.

903
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,167
None would dare enter Erebor...

904
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,480
...whilst the dragon lives.

905
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:40,330
You know nothing.

906
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:43,206
Your world will burn.

907
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,084
What are you talking about?

908
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,806
Speak!

909
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:50,050
Our time has come again.

910
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,968
My master serves the One.

911
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,886
Do you understand now, Elfling?

912
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,003
Death is upon you.

913
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,447
The flames of war...

914
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,330
...are upon you.

915
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,447
Why did you do that?

916
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,803
You promised to set him free.

917
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,166
And I did.

918
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:16,443
I freed his wretched head
from his miserable shoulders.

919
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:18,643
There was more...

920
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,644
...the Orc could tell us.

921
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,327
There was nothing more he could tell me.

922
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,760
What did he mean by "the flames of war"?

923
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,727
It means they intend to
unleash a weapon so great...

924
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,122
...it will destroy all before it.

925
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,202
I want the watch doubled at our borders.
All roads, all rivers.

926
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,204
Nothing moves, but I hear of it.

927
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,965
No one enters this kingdom.

928
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,645
And no one leaves it.

929
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,120
Watch out!

930
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,483
What are you trying...

931
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,410
...to do, drown us?

932
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,251
I was born and bred on these waters,
Master Dwarf.

933
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,891
If I wanted to drown you...

934
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,724
...I would not do it here.

935
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,201
Oh, I've had enough of this lippy Lakeman.

936
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,211
I say we throw him over the side
and be done with it.

937
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,926
- Bard, his name's Bard.
- How do you know?

938
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,931
Uh, I asked him.

939
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,771
I don't care what he calls himself.
I don't like him.

940
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,570
We do not have to like him.

941
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,450
We simply have to pay him.

942
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,489
Come on now, lads. Turn out...

943
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:48,720
...your pockets.

944
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,530
How do we know he won't betray us?

945
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,000
We don't.

946
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:54,960
There's...

947
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:56,080
...just a wee problem.

948
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,725
We're 10 coins short.

949
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:01,880
Gloin.

950
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:03,763
Come on.

951
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,128
- Give us what you have.
- Don't look to me.

952
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,567
I have been bled dry...

953
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:10,881
...by this venture.

954
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,200
What have I seen...

955
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,726
...for my investment?

956
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,324
Naught but misery and...

957
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,560
...grief and...

958
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,768
Bless my beard.

959
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:29,761
Take it.

960
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,291
- Take all of it.
- Ahem.

961
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,400
The money, quick. Give it to me.

962
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:38,208
We will pay you when we...

963
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,169
...get our provisions but not before.

964
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,880
If you value your freedom,
you'll do as I say.

965
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,606
There are guards ahead.

966
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,525
What's he doing?

967
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,080
He's talking to someone.

968
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:09,801
He's pointing right at us.

969
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:13,769
Now they're...

970
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:14,609
...shaking hands.

971
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,325
- What?
- The villain.

972
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,891
He's selling us out.

973
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:41,880
Quiet.

974
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,329
We're approaching the tollgate.

975
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:58,680
Halt!

976
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,171
Goods inspection!

977
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,763
Papers, please!

978
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,760
Oh, it's you, Bard.

979
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,047
Morning, Percy.

980
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,486
Anything to declare?

981
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,491
Nothing, but that I am cold and tired...

982
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:11,807
...and ready for home.

983
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,280
You and me both.

984
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,811
There we are.

985
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,040
All in order.

986
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,964
Not so fast.

987
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:27,448
"Consignment of empty barrels
from the Woodland Realm."

988
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:29,920
Only...

989
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,450
...they're not empty...

990
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,486
...are they, Bard?

991
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:36,720
If I recall correctly...

992
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,247
...you're licensed as a bargeman.

993
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,200
Not...

994
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:43,880
...a fisherman.

995
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,605
That's none of your business.

996
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,320
Wrong.

997
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,967
It's the Master's business,
which makes it my business.

998
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,771
Oh, come on, Alfrid, have a heart.
People need to eat.

999
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,241
These fish are illegal.

1000
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:57,649
Empty the barrels...

1001
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,087
...over the side.
- You heard him. In the canal.

1002
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,128
Come on. Get a move on.

1003
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,164
Folk in this town are struggling.

1004
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:07,926
Times are hard.

1005
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:09,200
Food is scarce.

1006
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,526
That's not my problem.

1007
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,960
And when the people hear
the Master is dumping fish...

1008
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,650
...back in the lake...

1009
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,770
...when the rioting starts...

1010
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,965
...will it be your problem then?

1011
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,041
Stop.

1012
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,640
Ever the people's champion...

1013
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,882
...eh, Bard? Protector of...

1014
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,120
...the common folk.

1015
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,840
You might have their favor now,
bargeman...

1016
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:37,880
...but it won't last.

1017
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,166
Raise the gate!

1018
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,209
The Master has his eye on you.

1019
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,930
You'd do well to remember:

1020
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,725
We know where you live.

1021
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,644
It's a small town, Alfrid.

1022
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,408
Everyone knows where everyone lives.

1023
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,881
All this talk of civil unrest.

1024
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,804
Someone's been stirring the pot, sire.

1025
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,441
Gout playing up, sire?

1026
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:22,680
It's the damp.

1027
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,280
It's the only possible explanation.

1028
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:25,721
Get me a brandy.

1029
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,410
The mood of the people, sire,
it's turning ugly.

1030
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,610
They're commoners, Alfrid.
They've always been ugly.

1031
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,480
It's not my fault they live in a place...

1032
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:37,371
...that stinks of fish oil and tar.

1033
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:41,050
Jobs, shelter, food.

1034
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,930
It's all they ever bleat about.

1035
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:46,801
It's my belief, sire, they are
being led on by troublemakers.

1036
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,485
<i>Then</i> we must find these...

1037
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,683
...troublemakers and arrest them.

1038
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,843
My thoughts exactly, sire.

1039
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,924
And all this talk of change
must be suppressed.

1040
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,447
Can't afford to let the rabble
band together...

1041
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,480
...and start making noises.
The next thing...

1042
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:04,564
...you know, they'll start
asking questions...

1043
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,404
...forming committees...

1044
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,805
...launching inquiries.

1045
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,520
Out with the old, in with the new?

1046
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,240
What?

1047
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,488
That's what they've been saying, sire.

1048
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:16,720
There is even talk...

1049
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,160
...of an election.

1050
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,606
An election? Heh.

1051
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,171
That's absurd.

1052
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,402
I won't stand for it. Ha!

1053
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,441
I don't think they'd ask
you to stand, sire.

1054
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:29,890
Shirkers.

1055
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,120
Ingrates.

1056
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:32,327
Rabble-rousers.

1057
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,291
Who would have the nerve
to question my authority?

1058
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,205
Who would dare?

1059
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:38,441
Who...?

1060
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:44,725
Bard.

1061
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,130
You mark my words:

1062
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,004
That trouble-making bargeman...

1063
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,844
...is behind all this.

1064
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:51,888
No one else would have the...

1065
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:52,769
Bollocks...

1066
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
...sire.

1067
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:58,320
Ram and goat,
sautéed in a lovely little mushroom gravy.

1068
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,920
In an ideal world, sire, we'd arrest him.

1069
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:06,370
But Bard has the favor of the people.

1070
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,126
They see him as a leader.

1071
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,041
Someone they can truly admire.

1072
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,520
Modest...

1073
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,325
...intelligent...

1074
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:17,686
...handsome...

1075
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,285
...athletic...

1076
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:23,127
Yes, he's clearly modeling himself on me.

1077
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,442
That's no crime.

1078
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,206
I wonder...

1079
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:33,926
I wonder if some ancient law might exist...

1080
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:38,210
...that forbids bargemen
from asking questions.

1081
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:43,805
You think such a venerable statute
might exist?

1082
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:48,211
Almost certainly, sire.

1083
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:53,245
I'll write one immediately.

1084
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:00,087
You picked the wrong man...

1085
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:03,130
...to tangle with, Master Bard.

1086
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,369
I hope you're watching yourself...

1087
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,244
<i>...because I'll be watching you.</i>

1088
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:17,441
Get your hands off me.

1089
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,800
You didn't see them.
They were never here.

1090
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,084
The fish you can have for nothing.

1091
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,563
Stay close.

1092
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,286
Follow me.

1093
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,520
What is this place?

1094
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:43,564
This, Mr. Baggins, is the world of Men.

1095
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,086
Get it over here now.

1096
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,322
Grab the other end. That's it.

1097
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,771
Keep your head's down, keep moving.

1098
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Quickly, now.

1099
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:54,124
God, how many more are there?

1100
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:56,560
Halt.

1101
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:57,968
Oi!

1102
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:58,809
Come on. Move.

1103
01:28:59,040 --> 01:28:59,643
In the name...

1104
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:00,529
...of the Master of Lake-town...

1105
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:01,760
...I said halt.

1106
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,320
Halt!

1107
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,280
Stop them!

1108
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:07,720
- Get back.
- Come here.

1109
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,245
What's going on here?

1110
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,847
Stay where you are. Nobody leaves.

1111
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,248
Braga.

1112
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,527
- Sorry?
- You.

1113
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,766
What are you up to, Bard?

1114
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,040
Me?

1115
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,160
Nothing.

1116
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,645
I'm looking for nothing.

1117
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,160
Yeah.

1118
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,124
Hey, Braga.

1119
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:10,370
Your wife would look lovely in this.

1120
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,811
What do you know of my wife?

1121
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,004
I know her as well
as any man in this town.

1122
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:33,041
Da!

1123
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,329
Our house, it's being watched.

1124
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,120
You can tell the Master
I'm done...

1125
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:14,320
...for the day.

1126
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,767
Da! Where have you been?

1127
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:21,010
Father! There you are! I was worried.

1128
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,771
Here, Sigrid.

1129
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,320
<i>Bah, get them in.</i>

1130
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:34,646
If you speak of this to anyone...

1131
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,325
...I'll rip your arms off.

1132
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,690
Get off.

1133
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,201
Up there.

1134
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:51,960
Da...

1135
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:54,281
...why are there Dwarves
climbing out of our toilet?

1136
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,851
Will they bring us luck?

1137
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:01,282
They may not be the best fit...

1138
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,284
...but they'll keep you warm.

1139
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,007
Thank you very much.

1140
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,282
A Dwarvish windlance.

1141
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,169
You look like...

1142
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:19,726
...you've seen a ghost.

1143
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,641
He has.

1144
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,441
The last time we saw...

1145
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,364
...such a weapon...

1146
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,400
...a city was on fire.

1147
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,561
It was the day the dragon came.

1148
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,290
<i>The day that Smaug...</i>

1149
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:37,646
<i>...destroyed Dale.</i>

1150
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,327
<i>Girion, the Lord of the City...</i>

1151
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:43,322
<i>...rallied his bowmen...</i>

1152
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,686
<i>...to fire upon the beast.</i>

1153
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,569
But a dragon's hide is tough.

1154
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:50,322
Tougher than the strongest armor.

1155
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,769
Only a Black Arrow fired
from a windlance...

1156
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,604
...could have pierced the dragon's hide.

1157
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:57,607
<i>And few of those...</i>

1158
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,649
<i>...arrows were ever made.</i>

1159
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,086
<i>The store was running low...</i>

1160
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:07,169
<i>...when Girion...</i>

1161
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,440
<i>...made his last stand.</i>

1162
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,802
Had the aim of Men been true that day...

1163
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,243
...much would have been different.

1164
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:28,283
You speak as if you were there.

1165
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:31,768
All Dwarves know the tale.

1166
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,287
Then you would know
that Girion hit the dragon.

1167
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,409
He loosened a scale under the left wing.

1168
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:38,600
One more shot and
he would have killed the beast.

1169
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,769
That's a fairy story, lad.

1170
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,411
Nothing more.

1171
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,765
You took our money.

1172
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:48,126
Where are the weapons?

1173
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,926
Wait here.

1174
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:07,128
Tomorrow begins...

1175
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,440
...the last days of autumn.

1176
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,887
Durin's Day falls the morn after next.

1177
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:13,043
We must reach the mountain before then.

1178
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,645
And if we do not?

1179
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:17,201
If we fail to find the hidden door
before that time?

1180
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:18,920
Then this quest has been for nothing.

1181
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,486
What is this?

1182
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,326
Pike hook.

1183
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,721
Made from an old harpoon.

1184
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,482
- And this?
- A crowbill, we call it.

1185
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,290
Fashioned from a smithy's hammer.

1186
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,045
It's heavy in hand, I grant...

1187
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:45,045
...but in defense of your life,
these will serve you better than none.

1188
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,042
We paid...

1189
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:48,009
...you for weapons.

1190
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:49,810
Iron-forged swords...

1191
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:51,041
...and axes!

1192
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,280
It's a joke!

1193
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:55,043
You won't find...

1194
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,930
...better outside the city armory.

1195
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,525
All iron-forged weapons are held there...

1196
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,006
...under lock and key.

1197
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:01,287
Thorin...

1198
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:02,648
...why not take what's...

1199
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:03,880
...on offer and go?

1200
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:05,246
I've made do with less.

1201
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:06,520
So have you.

1202
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,802
- I say we leave now.
- You're not going anywhere.

1203
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,040
What did you say?

1204
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,480
There are spies watching this house...

1205
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:16,405
...and probably every dock
and wharf in the town.

1206
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:17,649
You must wait...

1207
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:18,880
...till nightfall.

1208
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,441
Thorin.

1209
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:50,606
Da?

1210
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,245
Don't let them leave.

1211
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,361
Tauriel...

1212
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:31,208
...you cannot hunt 30 Orcs...

1213
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:32,480
...on your own.

1214
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,489
But I'm not on my own.

1215
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:36,606
You knew I would come.

1216
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:40,240
The king is angry...

1217
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,129
...Tauriel. For 600 years...

1218
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:44,089
...my father has protected you,
favored you.

1219
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,565
You defied his orders.

1220
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,211
You betrayed his trust.

1221
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:59,770
The king has never let Orc filth...

1222
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
...roam our lands.

1223
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:04,488
Yet he would let this Orc pack cross
our borders and kill our prisoners.

1224
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:06,046
It is not our fight.

1225
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:07,805
It is our fight.

1226
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,049
It will not end here.

1227
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:13,170
With every victory, this evil will grow.

1228
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:16,171
If your father has his way,
we will do nothing.

1229
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:18,522
We will hide within our walls...

1230
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:21,081
...live our lives away from the light...

1231
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:22,885
...and let darkness descend.

1232
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:26,649
Are we not part of this world?

1233
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,046
<i>Tell me, mellon.</i>

1234
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:32,762
When did we let evil
become stronger than us?

1235
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:40,371
Hello, Bard. What you after?

1236
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:42,970
There was a tapestry!

1237
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,808
An old one! Where's it gone?

1238
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:47,320
What tapestry you talking about?

1239
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:48,600
This one.

1240
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:50,800
They were Dwarves, I tell you.
Appeared...

1241
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
...out of nowhere.

1242
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:54,242
Full beards. Fierce eyes.

1243
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:56,124
I've never seen the like.

1244
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,482
What are Dwarves doing in these parts?

1245
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:00,320
- It's the prophecy.
- The prophecy?

1246
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,369
The Prophecy of Durin's Folk.

1247
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,205
Prophecy.

1248
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,041
Prophecy.

1249
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:19,566
The old tales will come true.

1250
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,081
Vast halls of treasure!

1251
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,482
Silver and gold and jewels beyond measure.

1252
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:25,760
Can you imagine?

1253
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:27,121
Can it really be true?

1254
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,091
Has the lord of silver fountains returned?

1255
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,971
<i>The lord of the silver fountains</i>

1256
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,487
<i>The King of carven stone</i>

1257
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:39,324
<i>The King beneath the mountain</i>

1258
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,443
<i>Shall come into his own!</i>

1259
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,649
<i>And the bell shall ring in gladness</i>

1260
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:46,483
<i>At the Mountain</i>

1261
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:48,245
<i>King's return</i>

1262
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:51,211
<i>But all shall fail in sadness</i>

1263
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:54,531
<i>And the lake will shine and burn</i>

1264
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:58,520
Da, I tried to stop them.

1265
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,165
How long have they been gone?

1266
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,000
- Can you see anything?
- Shh! Keep it down.

1267
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:07,520
As soon as we have the weapons...

1268
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:09,165
...we make straight for the mountain.

1269
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:10,606
Go, go, go.

1270
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,161
Go, Nori.

1271
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,281
Next.

1272
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:22,760
<i>Prophecy?</i>

1273
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:25,208
Who dragged up that old nonsense?

1274
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,169
People, sire.

1275
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:28,401
They're gathering in the streets.

1276
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:31,723
They're saying that a king will return
to the Lonely Mountain...

1277
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:35,681
...and that the rivers will once more
run with gold.

1278
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:38,247
Rivers of gold? Poppycock.

1279
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:41,281
As you say, sire.

1280
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:44,360
But people will believe
what they want to believe.

1281
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,966
It's been a long time
since they've seen any riches.

1282
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:51,602
The old tales offer them hope.

1283
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:02,561
You all right?

1284
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,086
I can manage.

1285
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,444
Let's just get out of here.

1286
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:21,440
Run!

1287
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:22,686
Quickly! Move now!

1288
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:38,046
Get off me! Get off!

1289
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:39,884
Move them along here.

1290
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,001
Move on!

1291
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:52,130
What is the meaning of this?

1292
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,487
We caught them stealing weapons, sire.

1293
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:58,001
Ah. Enemies of the state, eh?

1294
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,240
A desperate bunch of...

1295
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:01,442
...mercenaries, if ever there was, sire.

1296
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:02,920
Hold your tongue!

1297
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,602
You do not know to whom you speak.

1298
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,089
This is no common criminal.

1299
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:11,725
This is Thorin...

1300
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:15,089
...son of Thrain, son of Thror!

1301
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,322
We are the Dwarves of Erebor.

1302
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:26,203
We have come to reclaim our homeland.

1303
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:33,924
I remember this town
in the great days of old.

1304
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:37,288
Fleets of boats lay at harbor...

1305
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:38,931
...filled with silks and fine gems.

1306
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,527
This was no forsaken town on a lake.

1307
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:46,245
This was the center of all trade
in the North!

1308
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:48,649
I would...

1309
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:50,126
...see those days return.

1310
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:52,886
I would relight the great forges
of the Dwarves...

1311
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:54,087
...and send wealth and riches...

1312
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,800
...flowing once more
from the Halls of Erebor!

1313
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:00,800
Death!

1314
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:02,601
That is what you will...

1315
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,126
...bring upon us!

1316
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,684
Dragon fire and ruin.

1317
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:11,049
If you waken that beast...

1318
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:13,284
...it will destroy us all.

1319
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,363
You can listen to this naysayer...

1320
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,250
...but I promise you this:

1321
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:21,085
If we succeed...

1322
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:24,966
...all will share in the wealth
of the mountain.

1323
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,409
You will have enough gold
to rebuild Esgaroth...

1324
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:33,886
...10 times over!

1325
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,522
Why should we take you at your word?

1326
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:48,410
We know nothing about you.

1327
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,840
Who here can vouch for your character?

1328
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:00,600
Me.

1329
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:03,720
I'll vouch for him.

1330
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:06,806
I have traveled far...

1331
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:09,162
...with these Dwarves
through great danger...

1332
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:12,643
...and if Thorin Oakenshield...

1333
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,046
...gives his word...

1334
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,162
...then he will keep it.

1335
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,121
All of you!

1336
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:22,601
Listen to me!

1337
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:23,887
You must listen!

1338
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,849
Have you forgotten
what happened to Dale?

1339
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:28,760
Have you forgotten those...

1340
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:30,888
...who died in the firestorm?!

1341
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,160
And for what purpose?

1342
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,409
The blind ambition of a Mountain King...

1343
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:40,282
...so riven by greed, he could not...

1344
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:42,045
...see beyond his own desire!

1345
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,884
Now, now!

1346
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:47,168
We must not, any of us...

1347
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,767
...be too quick to lay blame.

1348
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:51,489
Let us...

1349
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,449
...not forget that it was...

1350
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:55,489
...Girion, Lord of Dale...

1351
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,410
...your ancestor...

1352
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:00,160
...who failed to kill the beast!

1353
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,688
It's true, sire.

1354
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,126
We all know the story.

1355
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,404
Arrow after arrow, he shot.

1356
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:12,211
Each one missing its mark.

1357
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:20,246
You have no right.

1358
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:23,843
No right to enter that mountain.

1359
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:27,688
I have the only right.

1360
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:35,405
I speak to the Master...

1361
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,130
...of the Men of the Lake.

1362
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,681
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?

1363
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:41,640
Will you...

1364
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:45,726
...share in the great wealth
of our people?

1365
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:52,165
What say you?

1366
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:59,089
I say unto you...

1367
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:01,361
Welcome!

1368
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:02,880
Welcome!

1369
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:03,920
And thrice...

1370
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,161
...welcome...

1371
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:07,050
...King Under the Mountain!

1372
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:21,646
You do know we're one short.
Where's Bofur?

1373
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:24,486
- If he's not here, we leave him behind.
- We'll have to.

1374
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:25,727
If we're to find the door before...

1375
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:28,531
...nightfall, we can risk no more delays.

1376
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:33,920
Not you.

1377
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:36,727
We must travel at speed.
You will slow us down.

1378
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,880
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you.

1379
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:41,040
Not now.

1380
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:48,520
I'm going to be there
when that door is opened.

1381
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:50,840
When we first look upon
the Halls of our Fathers, Thorin.

1382
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:53,201
Kili, stay here.

1383
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:54,961
Rest.

1384
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,205
Join us when you're healed.

1385
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:04,131
I'll stay with the lad.

1386
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:06,169
My duty lies with the wounded.

1387
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:07,400
Uncle.

1388
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:09,969
We grew up on tales of the mountain.

1389
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:11,486
Tales you told us.

1390
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:12,840
You cannot take that away...

1391
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:13,881
...from him!
- Fili.

1392
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:15,200
I will carry him if I must!

1393
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,841
One day you will be king
and you will understand.

1394
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:21,888
I cannot risk the fate of this quest
for the sake of one Dwarf.

1395
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:24,964
Not even my own kin.

1396
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:29,640
Fili, don't be a fool.

1397
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:31,600
You belong with the company.

1398
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:33,370
I belong with my brother.

1399
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,726
By my beard, is that the time?! Ah!

1400
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:52,849
Go now with our goodwill...

1401
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:54,491
...and good wishes.

1402
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:58,610
- And may your return bring good fortune...
- Wait!

1403
01:46:58,840 --> 01:46:59,966
...to all!

1404
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:05,447
Goodbye.

1405
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:12,523
Out of the way!

1406
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:14,125
No! No!

1407
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,768
Ha. So you missed the boat as well?

1408
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:24,561
Kili? Kili!

1409
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:27,405
<i>Hey-</i>

1410
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:29,569
Get out of there. Go on.

1411
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:33,004
Masterfully handled, sire.

1412
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,208
Your popularity has never been so high.

1413
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:37,403
The entire town twittering your name.

1414
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:39,483
Yes, it was rather clever.

1415
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:41,882
Either our little friends
return triumphant...

1416
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:45,090
...in which case,
I stand to make a pretty penny...

1417
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:48,443
...or old Smaug dines on Dwarf
for a day or two.

1418
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,329
The important thing is,
they're off our hands.

1419
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:52,560
Please, wait.

1420
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:54,966
Please. We need your help.

1421
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:56,770
- My brother is sick.
- Sick?

1422
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,280
Is it infectious?

1423
01:47:58,520 --> 01:47:59,248
Get back.

1424
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:01,050
Alfrid, Alfrid...

1425
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:03,080
- ...don't let them come any closer.
- Please.

1426
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:04,804
We need medicine.

1427
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:07,844
Do I look like an apothecary?

1428
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:09,686
Haven't we given you enough?

1429
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:11,081
The master's a busy man.

1430
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:14,164
He hasn't got time to worry
about sick Dwarves.

1431
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:15,840
Be gone with you. Go on.

1432
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:17,326
Clear off.

1433
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,683
What this town needs,
Alfrid, is a good purge.

1434
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:24,845
Starting with a certain troublemaker
who saw fit to question my authority.

1435
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:27,811
- A certain bargeman, sire?
- Precisely.

1436
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:31,401
No.

1437
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:33,290
I'm done with Dwarves. Go away.

1438
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:34,123
No, no...

1439
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:35,360
...no! Please!

1440
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:37,966
No one will help us. Kili's sick.

1441
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:41,641
He's very sick.

1442
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,162
So quiet.

1443
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:26,404
Wasn't always like this.

1444
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:31,806
Once, these slopes
were lined with woodlands.

1445
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:33,246
The trees...

1446
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:35,801
...were filled with birdsong.

1447
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:41,086
Relax, Master Baggins.

1448
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:45,960
We have food, we have tools,
and we're making good time.

1449
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:00,970
What is this place?

1450
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:02,600
It was once the city of Dale.

1451
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:06,164
Now it is a ruin.

1452
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:09,127
The desolation of Smaug.

1453
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,283
The sun will soon reach midday.

1454
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:13,960
We must find the hidden door
into the mountain before it sets.

1455
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:15,040
This way.

1456
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:17,168
Wait. Is this the overlook?

1457
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:18,845
Gandalf said to meet him here.

1458
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:20,920
- On no account were we to...
- Do you see him?

1459
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:22,043
We have no time...

1460
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:23,691
...to wait upon the Wizard.

1461
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:25,724
We're on our own. Come!

1462
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:44,604
Dol Guldur.

1463
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:47,042
The Hill of Sorcery.

1464
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,521
It looks completely abandoned.

1465
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:51,245
As it is meant to.

1466
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:53,725
A spell of concealment...

1467
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:57,043
...lies over this place, which means...

1468
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,363
...our Enemy is not yet ready
to reveal himself.

1469
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:05,688
He has not regained his full strength.

1470
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:09,488
Radagast, I need you to carry
a message to the Lady Galadriel.

1471
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:11,927
Tell her we must force his hand.

1472
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:13,241
What do you mean?

1473
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:15,050
I'm going in alone.

1474
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:17,801
On no account come after me.

1475
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:25,246
Do I have your word?

1476
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:27,482
Yes, yes, yes!

1477
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:40,690
Wait, Gandalf!

1478
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,763
What if it's a trap?!

1479
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:48,605
Turn around and do not come back.

1480
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:56,324
It's undoubtedly a trap.

1481
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,408
Anything?

1482
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:42,563
Nothing.

1483
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:47,281
If the map is true...

1484
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:51,005
...the hidden door lies directly above us.

1485
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:57,169
Up here!

1486
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:07,971
You have keen eyes, Mr. Baggins.

1487
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:10,562
Thrain?

1488
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:14,040
Son of Thror?

1489
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:18,170
My old friend.

1490
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:22,488
Gandalf?

1491
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:31,447
A lifetime.

1492
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:36,926
I have been here a lifetime.

1493
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:38,605
I'm so sorry...

1494
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:40,729
...I gave you up for dead.

1495
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:45,611
I had a son.

1496
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:49,084
I Will fight with you.

1497
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:56,320
Thorin.

1498
01:56:56,440 --> 01:56:59,649
And you will see him again, my friend.

1499
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:01,968
Come, we must leave.

1500
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:04,601
The Orcs had taken Moria.

1501
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:07,042
War. We were at war.

1502
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:11,767
I was surrounded.

1503
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:15,405
The Defiler.

1504
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:20,083
Azog the Defiler...

1505
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,482
...had come.

1506
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:12,362
They took it.

1507
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:14,807
The last of the seven.

1508
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:20,040
Come on, let's get you out of here.

1509
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:23,160
There is no way out.

1510
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:26,328
They will stop you.

1511
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,560
The serpents...

1512
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:30,007
...will stop you.

1513
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:34,401
It's an illusion.

1514
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:39,169
Just an illusion.

1515
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:44,323
What have they done to you?

1516
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:45,601
I never told them.

1517
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:48,844
They tried to make me,
but I never said a word.

1518
01:58:51,560 --> 01:58:55,485
Have you kept them safe, Gandalf?
The map and the key?

1519
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:57,601
I gave them to Thorin.

1520
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:59,080
You'd be proud of him.

1521
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:01,567
He's taken up the quest to reclaim Erebor.

1522
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:02,800
Erebor.

1523
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:04,965
He will retrieve the Arkenstone.

1524
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:06,560
The seven armies of the Dwarves...

1525
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:07,680
...will answer...

1526
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:09,205
...to a new king.
- No. No.

1527
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:11,602
Thorin must not go near Erebor.

1528
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:15,890
No one must enter that mountain.

1529
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:48,481
This must be it.

1530
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:52,205
The hidden door.

1531
01:59:56,440 --> 01:59:58,204
Let all those who doubted us...

1532
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:00,725
...rue this day!

1533
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:08,886
Right, then. We have a key.

1534
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:12,090
Which means that somewhere...

1535
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:14,611
...there is a key-hole.

1536
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:18,210
"The last light of Durin's Day...

1537
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:21,200
...will shine upon...

1538
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:22,691
...the key-hole."

1539
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:32,921
Nori.

1540
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:41,488
We're losing the light. Come on.

1541
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,606
Be quiet! I can't
hear when you're thumping.

1542
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:51,840
I can't find it.

1543
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:54,445
It's not here!

1544
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:55,761
It's not here!

1545
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:58,880
- Break it down!
- Aye.

1546
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:01,600
Come on!

1547
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:04,322
Break!

1548
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:05,561
It has to break.

1549
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:07,851
It's no good.

1550
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:10,600
The door's sealed. Can't
be opened by force.

1551
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:13,480
There's a powerful magic on it.

1552
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,126
No!

1553
02:01:29,480 --> 02:01:31,767
"The last light of Durin's Day...

1554
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:35,210
...will shine upon the key-hole."

1555
02:01:39,640 --> 02:01:41,244
That is what it says.

1556
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:47,165
What did we miss?

1557
02:01:51,120 --> 02:01:52,565
What did we miss?

1558
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:54,600
Balin?

1559
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,929
We've lost the light.

1560
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:01,283
There's no more to be done.

1561
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:03,409
We had but...

1562
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:04,920
...one chance.

1563
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:08,606
Come away, lads.

1564
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:10,649
It's over.

1565
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:13,848
- Wait a minute.
- We're too late.

1566
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:17,771
Where are they going?

1567
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:21,449
You can't give up now!

1568
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:37,521
Thorin.

1569
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:41,244
You can't give up now.

1570
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,167
"Stand by the gray stone...

1571
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:59,122
...when the thrush knocks."

1572
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:01,291
The setting sun.

1573
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:05,210
And "the last light of Durin's Day
will shine..."

1574
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:08,170
The last light.

1575
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:12,091
Last light.

1576
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:50,000
The last light!

1577
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:01,366
The key-hole!

1578
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:02,880
Come back!

1579
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:04,571
Come back!

1580
02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:07,002
It's the light of the moon! The last...

1581
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:10,323
...moon of autumn! Ha, ha, ha!

1582
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:14,641
Where's the key? Where's the key?
Where's the...?

1583
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:16,609
It was here.

1584
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:18,649
Come on, it was... It was here.

1585
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:20,360
It was just...

1586
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:19,645
Erebor.

1587
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:21,486
Thorin.

1588
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:36,769
I know these walls.

1589
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:42,045
These halls.

1590
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:46,451
This stone.

1591
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:50,963
You remember it...

1592
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:52,366
...Balin.

1593
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:58,486
Chambers filled with golden light.

1594
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:01,850
I remember.

1595
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:16,451
"Herein lies...

1596
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:18,609
...the Seventh Kingdom of...

1597
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:20,001
...Durin's Folk.

1598
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:25,043
May the Heart of the Mountain
unite all...

1599
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:28,887
...Dwarves in defense of this home."

1600
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:32,443
The Throne of the King.

1601
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:34,445
Ah.

1602
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:39,482
And what's that above it?

1603
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:44,769
The Arkenstone.

1604
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:47,491
Arkenstone.

1605
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:52,765
And what's that?

1606
02:06:53,080 --> 02:06:56,050
That, Master Burglar...

1607
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:59,128
...is why you are here.

1608
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,729
Can you not do something?

1609
02:07:19,960 --> 02:07:22,201
I need herbs.
Something to bring down his fever.

1610
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:24,807
I have nightshade. I have feverfew.

1611
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:27,890
They're no use to me.
Do you have any kingsfoil?

1612
02:07:28,120 --> 02:07:30,122
No, it's a weed. We feed it to the pigs.

1613
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,686
Pigs?

1614
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:33,086
Weed.

1615
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:34,966
Right.

1616
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:37,081
Don't move.

1617
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:43,407
You want me to find a jewel?

1618
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:46,689
A large, white jewel.

1619
02:07:47,120 --> 02:07:48,246
Yes.

1620
02:07:49,640 --> 02:07:52,211
That's it? Only, I imagine
there's quite a few down there.

1621
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:55,769
There is only one Arkenstone...

1622
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:58,602
...and you'll know it when you see it.

1623
02:07:59,720 --> 02:08:00,846
Right.

1624
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:05,203
In truth...

1625
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:06,440
...lad...

1626
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:09,168
...I do not know...

1627
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:11,482
...what you will find down there.

1628
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:16,763
You needn't go if you don't want to.
There's no dishonor in turning back.

1629
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,000
No, Balin.

1630
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:21,248
I promised I would do this...

1631
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:23,649
...and I think I must try.

1632
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:30,049
It never ceases to amaze me.

1633
02:08:30,280 --> 02:08:31,280
What's that?

1634
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:33,044
The courage of Hobbits.

1635
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:36,680
Go now...

1636
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:41,205
...with as much luck as you can muster.

1637
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:49,686
Oh, Bilbo?

1638
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:54,407
If there is, in fact...

1639
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:56,920
...a live dragon...

1640
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:58,047
...down there...

1641
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:02,491
...don't waken it.

1642
02:09:22,520 --> 02:09:24,761
He is waiting for them.

1643
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:26,280
They are in league.

1644
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:29,603
The dragon and the One.

1645
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:31,251
Hurry. We must hurry.

1646
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:55,165
Where is your master?

1647
02:09:56,960 --> 02:09:58,041
Where is he?!

1648
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:54,930
He is here.

1649
02:10:58,880 --> 02:10:59,880
Tell Thorin...

1650
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,082
...that I loved him.

1651
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:04,481
Will you do that?

1652
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:08,401
Will you tell my son that I loved him?

1653
02:11:08,680 --> 02:11:10,808
You will tell him yourself.

1654
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:14,250
It is too late.

1655
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:40,650
Sauron!

1656
02:13:03,240 --> 02:13:04,321
Hello?

1657
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:24,771
He's not at home.

1658
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:27,404
Not at home. Ahem.

1659
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:29,321
Good.

1660
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:32,849
Good, good, good.

1661
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:28,040
What's that?

1662
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:33,688
Shush. Shush.

1663
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,286
Arkenstone.

1664
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:38,731
Arkenstone.

1665
02:14:39,560 --> 02:14:41,608
A large, white jewel.

1666
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:45,165
Very helpful.

1667
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:12,171
Well...

1668
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:15,126
...thief.

1669
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:20,761
I smell you.

1670
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:24,329
I hear your breath.

1671
02:17:25,640 --> 02:17:27,244
I feel...

1672
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:28,520
...your air.

1673
02:17:32,360 --> 02:17:34,886
Where are you?

1674
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:37,441
Where are you?

1675
02:17:57,560 --> 02:17:58,561
Come, now...

1676
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:01,448
...don't be shy.

1677
02:18:01,720 --> 02:18:03,927
Step into the light.

1678
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:09,120
Hmm.

1679
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:14,049
There is something about you.

1680
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:18,440
Something you...

1681
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:19,480
...carry.

1682
02:18:20,480 --> 02:18:23,370
Something made of gold.

1683
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:27,044
But far more...

1684
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:29,089
...precious.

1685
02:18:29,320 --> 02:18:31,641
<i>Precious! Precious!</i>

1686
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:35,601
There you are...

1687
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:37,405
...Thief in the...

1688
02:18:37,640 --> 02:18:39,483
...Shadows.

1689
02:18:41,320 --> 02:18:43,926
I did not come to steal from you...

1690
02:18:44,160 --> 02:18:45,160
...O Smaug...

1691
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:48,443
...the Unassessably Wealthy.
I merely wanted...

1692
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:50,324
...to gaze upon your magnificence.

1693
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:51,680
To see...

1694
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:54,730
...if you really were as great
as the old tales say.

1695
02:18:55,440 --> 02:18:57,169
I did not believe them.

1696
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,925
And do you now?!

1697
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:12,520
Truly...

1698
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:16,047
...the tales and songs...

1699
02:19:17,160 --> 02:19:19,891
...fall utterly short of your enormity...

1700
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:23,090
...O Smaug the Stupendous.

1701
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:26,210
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

1702
02:19:26,720 --> 02:19:27,720
No, no.

1703
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:29,410
No, indeed.

1704
02:19:31,680 --> 02:19:34,923
You seem familiar with my name...

1705
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:38,050
...but I don't remember smelling
your kind before.

1706
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:40,764
Who are you...

1707
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,526
...and where do you come from...

1708
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:46,081
...may I ask?

1709
02:19:55,640 --> 02:19:57,324
I come from under the hill.

1710
02:19:57,680 --> 02:19:59,091
Underhill?

1711
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:03,800
And under hills...

1712
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:05,922
...and over hills my path has led.

1713
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:07,800
And... And...

1714
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:10,767
...through the air.
I am he who walks unseen.

1715
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:12,729
Impressive.

1716
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:15,008
What else do you claim to be?

1717
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:16,960
I am...

1718
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,490
Luck-wearer.

1719
02:20:22,920 --> 02:20:24,081
Riddle-maker.

1720
02:20:24,360 --> 02:20:26,010
Lovely titles.

1721
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:27,881
Go on.

1722
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:29,241
Barrel-rider.

1723
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:32,882
Barrels? Now that is interesting.

1724
02:20:34,360 --> 02:20:35,088
And what about...

1725
02:20:35,320 --> 02:20:38,290
...your little Dwarf friends?

1726
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:40,640
Where are they hiding?

1727
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:45,090
Dwarves?

1728
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:47,001
No.

1729
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:49,205
No, no. No Dwarves here.

1730
02:20:49,440 --> 02:20:50,521
You've got that all wrong.

1731
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:54,566
Oh, I don't think so, Barrel-rider!

1732
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:56,360
They sent you in here...

1733
02:20:56,640 --> 02:20:58,608
...to do their dirty work while they...

1734
02:20:58,840 --> 02:21:00,808
...skulk about outside.

1735
02:21:02,040 --> 02:21:03,201
Truly...

1736
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,161
...you are mistaken...

1737
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:08,444
...O Smaug, Chiefest
and Greatest of Calamities.

1738
02:21:08,680 --> 02:21:12,082
You have nice manners...

1739
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:14,288
...for a thief and...

1740
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:15,520
...a liar!

1741
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:20,202
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.

1742
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:21,846
No one better!

1743
02:21:23,560 --> 02:21:24,971
It is the gold!

1744
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:25,962
They are drawn...

1745
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:27,247
...to treasure like...

1746
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:29,050
...flies to dead flesh.

1747
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:33,840
Did you think I did not know...

1748
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:35,770
...this day would come?!

1749
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:38,926
That a pack of...

1750
02:21:39,160 --> 02:21:40,491
...canting Dwarves...

1751
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:43,041
...would come crawling back...

1752
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:44,840
...to the mountain?!

1753
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:50,606
Was that an earthquake?

1754
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:52,968
That, my lad...

1755
02:21:56,200 --> 02:21:57,645
...was a dragon.

1756
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:06,960
Da?

1757
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:08,644
It's coming from the mountain.

1758
02:22:12,720 --> 02:22:13,960
You should leave us.

1759
02:22:14,240 --> 02:22:14,889
Take your children.

1760
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:16,120
Get out of here.

1761
02:22:16,680 --> 02:22:17,966
And go where?

1762
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:20,451
There is nowhere to go.

1763
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:23,925
Are we going to die, Da?

1764
02:22:25,960 --> 02:22:27,121
No, darling.

1765
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:27,969
The dragon.

1766
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:29,685
It's going to kill us.

1767
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:42,169
Not if I kill it first.

1768
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:47,286
The King Under the Mountain is dead.

1769
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:49,204
I took his throne.

1770
02:22:49,560 --> 02:22:50,560
I ate his...

1771
02:22:50,760 --> 02:22:53,525
...people like a wolf among sheep.

1772
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:58,441
I kill where...

1773
02:22:58,720 --> 02:23:00,324
...I wish, when...

1774
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:02,045
...I Wish.

1775
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:05,602
My armor is iron.

1776
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:17,206
No blade can pierce me.

1777
02:23:20,360 --> 02:23:21,600
All right.

1778
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:24,207
A Black Arrow? Why did you never tell me?

1779
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:26,090
Because you did not need to know.

1780
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:35,205
Listen to me carefully.

1781
02:23:35,560 --> 02:23:37,722
I need you to distract the guards.

1782
02:23:38,280 --> 02:23:38,883
Once I'm at the top of...

1783
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:41,407
...the tower, I'll set
the arrow to the bow.

1784
02:23:41,680 --> 02:23:42,249
There he is!

1785
02:23:42,520 --> 02:23:43,089
Bard!

1786
02:23:43,320 --> 02:23:45,527
- After him!
- Quickly! Down there. Go!

1787
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:46,760
Stop him!

1788
02:23:53,800 --> 02:23:54,800
Stop him!

1789
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:56,520
Stop!

1790
02:24:00,280 --> 02:24:01,930
<i>Bain! Bain.</i>

1791
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:06,446
Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find it.
I'll deal with them.

1792
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:08,409
- I'm not leaving you.
- Now go!

1793
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:13,009
Braga.

1794
02:24:13,240 --> 02:24:13,889
You're under arrest.

1795
02:24:14,120 --> 02:24:17,010
- On what charge?
- Any charge the Master chooses.

1796
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,411
Where's he gone?

1797
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:00,761
What about Bilbo?

1798
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:02,001
Give him more time.

1799
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:04,402
Time to do what? To be killed?

1800
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:08,120
You're afraid.

1801
02:25:09,800 --> 02:25:12,087
Yes, I'm afraid.

1802
02:25:13,240 --> 02:25:14,605
I fear for you.

1803
02:25:15,960 --> 02:25:18,122
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard.

1804
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:19,560
A sickness which drove...

1805
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:20,886
...your grandfather mad.

1806
02:25:21,160 --> 02:25:22,730
I am not my grandfather.

1807
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:24,724
You're not yourself.

1808
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:27,728
The Thorin I know would not hesitate
to go in there...

1809
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:28,569
I will not risk...

1810
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:32,600
...this quest for the life of one burglar.

1811
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:35,925
Bilbo.

1812
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:38,203
His name is Bilbo.

1813
02:25:41,960 --> 02:25:43,769
It's Oakenshield...

1814
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:47,010
...that filthy Dwarvish usurper.

1815
02:25:49,240 --> 02:25:51,402
He sent you in here...

1816
02:25:51,640 --> 02:25:54,405
...for the Arkenstone, didn't he?

1817
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:55,289
No. No...

1818
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:58,410
...no. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1819
02:25:58,640 --> 02:25:59,766
Don't bother denying it.

1820
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:02,969
I guessed his foul purpose
some time ago.

1821
02:26:05,560 --> 02:26:07,164
But it matters not.

1822
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:10,687
Oakenshield's quest will fail.

1823
02:26:12,680 --> 02:26:14,444
The darkness is coming.

1824
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:19,285
<i>It will spread to every corner of the land.</i>

1825
02:27:01,880 --> 02:27:03,848
You are being used, Thief...

1826
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:06,208
...in the Shadows.
You were only...

1827
02:27:06,440 --> 02:27:09,046
...ever a means to an end.

1828
02:27:09,880 --> 02:27:10,483
The coward...

1829
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:13,291
...Oakenshield has weighed...

1830
02:27:13,560 --> 02:27:15,130
...the value of your life...

1831
02:27:15,400 --> 02:27:17,562
...and found it worth nothing.

1832
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:19,366
No.

1833
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:21,080
No.

1834
02:27:22,040 --> 02:27:23,040
No, you're lying.

1835
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:24,441
What did he promise you?

1836
02:27:24,880 --> 02:27:26,962
A share of the treasure?

1837
02:27:27,960 --> 02:27:29,121
As if it was his...

1838
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:30,441
...to give.

1839
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:33,044
I will not part with...

1840
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:34,281
...a single coin.

1841
02:27:34,960 --> 02:27:37,486
Not one piece of it.

1842
02:27:41,360 --> 02:27:42,360
My teeth...

1843
02:27:42,480 --> 02:27:43,686
...are swords.

1844
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:47,882
My claws are spears.

1845
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,161
My Wings...

1846
02:27:51,800 --> 02:27:54,326
...are a hurricane.

1847
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:01,803
So it is true.

1848
02:28:02,160 --> 02:28:04,322
The Black Arrow found its mark.

1849
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:05,560
What did you say?

1850
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:10,211
I was just saying your reputation
precedes you, O Smaug...

1851
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:11,646
...the Tyrannical.

1852
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:13,321
Truly.

1853
02:28:13,560 --> 02:28:15,528
You have no equal on this earth.

1854
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:20,609
I am...

1855
02:28:20,880 --> 02:28:24,123
...almost tempted to let you take it.

1856
02:28:24,560 --> 02:28:26,562
If only to see Oakenshield...

1857
02:28:26,840 --> 02:28:27,840
...suffer.

1858
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:29,961
Watch it...

1859
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:31,725
...destroy him.

1860
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:35,329
Watch it corrupt his heart...

1861
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,401
...and drive him mad.

1862
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:43,170
But I think not.

1863
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:46,001
I think our little game ends here.

1864
02:28:46,840 --> 02:28:48,080
So tell me...

1865
02:28:48,360 --> 02:28:49,360
...thief...

1866
02:28:50,120 --> 02:28:52,248
...how do you choose to die?

1867
02:29:35,680 --> 02:29:36,680
Nah.

1868
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:06,928
Da? Is that you, Da?

1869
02:30:40,040 --> 02:30:41,371
- Aah!
- Stay down!

1870
02:31:42,200 --> 02:31:43,200
Get down!

1871
02:32:19,400 --> 02:32:20,561
You killed them all.

1872
02:32:20,800 --> 02:32:21,881
There are others.

1873
02:32:22,320 --> 02:32:23,401
Tauriel.

1874
02:32:23,880 --> 02:32:25,006
Come.

1875
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:30,040
We're losing him.

1876
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:35,126
Tauriel.

1877
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:00,041
Athelas.

1878
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:04,325
Athelas.

1879
02:33:05,320 --> 02:33:06,401
What are you doing?

1880
02:33:09,400 --> 02:33:11,129
I'm going to save him.

1881
02:33:31,880 --> 02:33:33,360
- You're alive!
- Not for much longer.

1882
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:36,410
- Did you find the Arkenstone? The Arkenstone.
- The dragon's coming.

1883
02:33:39,360 --> 02:33:40,930
Did you find it?

1884
02:33:46,440 --> 02:33:47,521
We have to get out.

1885
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:52,241
Thorin.

1886
02:33:55,960 --> 02:33:57,086
Thorin.

1887
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:29,648
You will burn!

1888
02:34:30,800 --> 02:34:31,800
- Run!
- Ah!

1889
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:39,881
Come on, Bilbo!

1890
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:53,807
Come on.

1891
02:35:10,960 --> 02:35:12,166
Hold him down.

1892
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:30,289
Unh! Tilda.

1893
02:36:23,160 --> 02:36:24,366
Shh, Shh, Shh!

1894
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:33,645
We've given him the slip.

1895
02:36:33,880 --> 02:36:34,881
No.

1896
02:36:35,360 --> 02:36:37,567
He's too cunning for that.

1897
02:36:39,320 --> 02:36:40,446
So where to now?

1898
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:42,371
The western guardroom.

1899
02:36:43,080 --> 02:36:44,605
There may be a way out.

1900
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:46,882
It's too high. There's no chance...

1901
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:49,202
...that way.
- it's our only chance.

1902
02:36:50,520 --> 02:36:52,010
We have to try.

1903
02:37:08,560 --> 02:37:09,721
Come on.

1904
02:37:57,240 --> 02:38:01,006
I've heard tell of
the wonders of Elvish medicine.

1905
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:03,971
That was a privilege to witness.

1906
02:38:06,440 --> 02:38:07,601
Tauriel.

1907
02:38:11,920 --> 02:38:13,126
Lie still.

1908
02:38:20,320 --> 02:38:22,448
You cannot be her.

1909
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:28,082
She is far away.

1910
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:33,691
She is far...

1911
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:35,524
...far away from me.

1912
02:38:37,160 --> 02:38:39,288
She walks...

1913
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:42,205
...in starlight in another world.

1914
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:49,488
It was just a dream.

1915
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:03,401
Do you think she could've loved me?

1916
02:39:10,720 --> 02:39:11,720
Stay close.

1917
02:39:22,120 --> 02:39:23,120
That's it, then.

1918
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:26,003
There's no way out.

1919
02:39:32,400 --> 02:39:34,641
The last of our kin.

1920
02:39:38,320 --> 02:39:40,402
They must have come here...

1921
02:39:41,080 --> 02:39:42,127
...hoping...

1922
02:39:42,360 --> 02:39:43,521
...beyond hope.

1923
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:55,601
We could try to reach the mines.

1924
02:39:56,440 --> 02:39:58,681
We might last a few days.

1925
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:01,887
No.

1926
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:07,081
I will not die like this.

1927
02:40:08,440 --> 02:40:09,601
Cowering.

1928
02:40:10,480 --> 02:40:12,289
Clawing for breath.

1929
02:40:17,200 --> 02:40:18,326
We make for the forges.

1930
02:40:18,600 --> 02:40:20,568
He'll see us, sure as death.

1931
02:40:20,800 --> 02:40:22,040
Not if we split up.

1932
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:23,280
Thorin...

1933
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:25,010
...we'll never make it.

1934
02:40:25,240 --> 02:40:26,765
Some of us might.

1935
02:40:27,160 --> 02:40:29,401
Lead him to the forges.

1936
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:32,162
We kill the dragon.

1937
02:40:33,880 --> 02:40:36,167
If this is to end in fire...

1938
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:39,001
...then we will all burn together.

1939
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:41,481
This way.

1940
02:40:45,960 --> 02:40:46,960
Flee.

1941
02:40:47,640 --> 02:40:48,640
Flee.

1942
02:40:49,560 --> 02:40:51,528
Run for your lives.

1943
02:40:52,280 --> 02:40:53,280
There is...

1944
02:40:53,800 --> 02:40:56,007
...nowhere to hide.

1945
02:40:56,240 --> 02:40:57,240
Behind you!

1946
02:40:57,440 --> 02:40:58,440
Worm!

1947
02:40:59,440 --> 02:41:00,440
Come on!

1948
02:41:02,480 --> 02:41:03,527
Run!

1949
02:41:05,480 --> 02:41:06,766
Hey, you!

1950
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:08,120
Here!

1951
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:07,808
This way. It's this way!

1952
02:44:08,080 --> 02:44:09,206
Come on!

1953
02:44:09,440 --> 02:44:10,440
Thorin!

1954
02:44:15,800 --> 02:44:16,926
Follow Balin!

1955
02:44:18,120 --> 02:44:19,360
- Thorin.
- Come on!

1956
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:36,565
Thorin!

1957
02:44:45,640 --> 02:44:46,687
Hold on!

1958
02:45:20,520 --> 02:45:21,851
Thorin!

1959
02:45:24,720 --> 02:45:26,290
Go. Go!

1960
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:33,686
The plan's not gonna work.
These furnaces are stone cold.

1961
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:35,285
He's right. We've no...

1962
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:37,841
...fire hot enough to set them ablaze.

1963
02:45:40,400 --> 02:45:41,765
Have we not?

1964
02:45:43,320 --> 02:45:46,244
I did not look to see you
so easily outwitted.

1965
02:45:50,200 --> 02:45:50,849
You have grown...

1966
02:45:51,080 --> 02:45:53,048
...slow and fat...

1967
02:45:53,880 --> 02:45:54,880
...in your dotage...

1968
02:45:57,200 --> 02:45:58,361
...slug!

1969
02:45:59,760 --> 02:46:01,444
Take cover. Go!

1970
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:29,563
Bombur!

1971
02:46:29,880 --> 02:46:31,291
Get those bellows working.

1972
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:32,646
Go!

1973
02:46:46,440 --> 02:46:47,009
Bilbo!

1974
02:46:47,280 --> 02:46:49,009
Up there. On my mark...

1975
02:46:49,280 --> 02:46:50,566
...pull that lever.

1976
02:47:01,080 --> 02:47:03,401
Balin! Can you still mix a flash-flame?

1977
02:47:03,640 --> 02:47:06,041
Aye. It'll only take a jiffy. Come on!

1978
02:47:07,800 --> 02:47:09,245
We don't have a jiffy.

1979
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:22,326
Where's the sulfur?

1980
02:47:22,720 --> 02:47:23,720
You sure you know what...

1981
02:47:23,800 --> 02:47:24,800
...you're doing?

1982
02:47:36,240 --> 02:47:37,240
Come on!

1983
02:47:59,320 --> 02:48:00,320
Now!

1984
02:49:56,760 --> 02:49:58,842
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings.

1985
02:50:46,920 --> 02:50:47,921
Keep going, Bilbo!

1986
02:50:48,480 --> 02:50:49,561
Run!

1987
02:51:34,880 --> 02:51:35,881
You think you...

1988
02:51:36,120 --> 02:51:38,088
...can deceive me, Barrel-rider?

1989
02:51:41,640 --> 02:51:44,644
You have come from Lake-town.

1990
02:51:46,360 --> 02:51:47,646
This is some...

1991
02:51:47,880 --> 02:51:51,168
...sordid scheme hatched between
these filthy Dwarves...

1992
02:51:51,400 --> 02:51:54,563
...and those miserable
tub-trading Lakemen.

1993
02:51:55,560 --> 02:51:57,483
Those sniveling cowards...

1994
02:51:57,720 --> 02:51:59,210
...with their long bows...

1995
02:51:59,440 --> 02:52:02,284
...and Black Arrows.

1996
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:04,529
Perhaps it is time...

1997
02:52:04,800 --> 02:52:06,689
...I paid them a visit.

1998
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:08,440
Oh, no.

1999
02:52:10,320 --> 02:52:11,810
This isn't their fault!

2000
02:52:12,040 --> 02:52:13,040
Wait!

2001
02:52:13,080 --> 02:52:14,684
You cannot go to Lake-town!

2002
02:52:16,600 --> 02:52:18,762
You care about them...

2003
02:52:19,480 --> 02:52:20,720
you?

2004
02:52:20,960 --> 02:52:21,960
Good.

2005
02:52:22,640 --> 02:52:23,243
Then you can...

2006
02:52:23,480 --> 02:52:25,050
...watch them die.

2007
02:52:30,600 --> 02:52:31,726
Here!

2008
02:52:32,640 --> 02:52:33,640
You witless worm.

2009
02:52:40,480 --> 02:52:41,891
You.

2010
02:52:42,280 --> 02:52:44,760
I am taking back what you stole.

2011
02:52:48,800 --> 02:52:49,449
You...

2012
02:52:49,720 --> 02:52:51,290
...will take nothing...

2013
02:52:51,560 --> 02:52:53,210
...from me...

2014
02:52:53,480 --> 02:52:54,641
...Dwarf.

2015
02:52:55,120 --> 02:52:58,408
I laid low your warriors...

2016
02:52:58,640 --> 02:53:00,244
...of old.

2017
02:53:00,520 --> 02:53:02,887
I instilled terror in...

2018
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:04,804
...the hearts of Men.

2019
02:53:05,960 --> 02:53:07,405
I am...

2020
02:53:07,640 --> 02:53:09,005
...King Under...

2021
02:53:09,520 --> 02:53:11,329
...the Mountain.

2022
02:53:11,760 --> 02:53:14,047
This is not your kingdom.

2023
02:53:14,280 --> 02:53:16,282
These are Dwarf lands.

2024
02:53:17,040 --> 02:53:18,040
This is Dwarf gold.

2025
02:53:20,360 --> 02:53:21,088
And we will...

2026
02:53:21,320 --> 02:53:23,482
...have our revenge.

2027
02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:46,040
Revenge?!

2028
02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:49,330
Revenge?!

2029
02:54:50,120 --> 02:54:54,045
I will show you revenge!

2030
02:55:31,520 --> 02:55:32,567
Listen to me!

2031
02:55:33,120 --> 02:55:35,407
Do you not know what is coming?

2032
02:55:37,840 --> 02:55:41,561
I am fire.

2033
02:55:42,760 --> 02:55:45,240
I am...

2034
02:55:47,480 --> 02:55:48,811
...death.

2035
02:55:57,520 --> 02:55:59,727
What have we done?
