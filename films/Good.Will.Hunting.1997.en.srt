1
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:38,093
Mod fx squared, dx.

2
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,473
So please finish Percival by next time.

3
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,935
I know many of you had this as undergraduates,
but it won't hurt to brush up.

4
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,899
Thank you, Steven.

5
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:59,197
I also put an advanced Fourier system
on the main hallway chalkboard.

6
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,325
I'm hoping that one of you
might prove it by the end of the semester.

7
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,370
Now the person to do so will
not only be in my good graces...

8
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,582
but also go on to fame and fortune...

9
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,710
by having their accomplishment recorded
and their name printed...

10
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,837
in the auspicious <i>M.I.T Tech.</i>

11
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,425
Former winners include Nobel laureates,
Field's medal winners...

12
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,804
renowned astrophysicists
and lowly M.I.T. professors.

13
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,683
That's all.
If you have any questions...

14
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,269
I'm sure that Tom has the answers.

15
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,641
Hi, Will.

16
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,726
- Kirsten, how you doing?
- I'm all right. How are you?

17
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,021
- Good.
- I didn't get on Cathy last night.

18
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,774
- Why not?
- I don't know.

19
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,151
- Cathy!
- What?

20
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:22,197
Why didn't you give me none of that nasty
little hoochie-woochie you usually throw at me?

21
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,575
Oh, fuck you
and your Irish curse, Chuckie.

22
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,579
Like I'd waste my energy spreadin' my legs
for that Tootsie Roll dick?

23
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,041
- Go home and give it a tug yourself.
- Tootsie Roll!

24
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,085
Toots!

25
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,546
She's missin' a tooth, Will.

26
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,341
She's got skin problems. I don't-

27
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,469
Plus, it's like 5-to-2 Morgan ends up
marryin' her, you know what I mean?

28
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,305
There's only so many times
you can bang your friend's future wife.

29
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,933
It's wrong. Where you goin'?

30
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,726
I'm gonna take off.

31
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,521
Fuck you, you're takin' off.
It's, like, what, 10:00?

32
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,857
No, I'm tired.

33
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,069
Irish curse?

34
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,030
She don't know.
There ain't no Irish curse.

35
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:34,030

36
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,309
Stop brushing me back.

37
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,605
Stop crowding the plate!
Which one will it be?

38
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,901
You're gonna get charged, you know that?

39
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,863
You think I'm afraid of you, you big fuck?
You're crowdin' the fuckin' plate.

40
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:31,493
Hey, Casey's bouncin' up a bar at
Harvard next week. We should go up there.

41
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,703
- What are we gonna do up there?
- I don't know.

42
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,791
We'll fuck up some smart kids.
Probably fit right in.

43
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,379
Ow! Fuckin' punk.

44
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,716
- Oh, what's up? You still tough?
- Come on!

45
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,677
Come on. Come on. That's it.

46
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:55,475
I'd hold you forever here

47
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:59,187
In my arms

48
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,189
- Professor Lambeau?
- Yes?

49
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,859
I'm in your applied theories class.
We're all up at the math and science building.

50
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,822
Come here. It's Saturday.

51
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:12,367
- Unless you wanna have a drink with me.
- Maybe.

52
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,536
We just couldn't wait
until Monday to find out.

53
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,497
- Find out what?
- Who proved the theorem.

54
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:44,149
This is correct. Who did this?

55
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,526
- Jack?
- It wasn't me.

56
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,279
- Nemesh?
- No way.

57
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,119
- Come on,Joey Mac!
- Billy, McNamara's up.

58
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,621
Come on, kid!

59
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,915
- Joey, dig it out! Dig it out!
- Another pitch!

60
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,834
Bring it down, Mac! That's how to do it!

61
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,586
Attaboy! Take two, Mac.

62
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,093
Hey, Morgan, who's the girl with
the striped pants? She's got a nice ass.

63
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,138
- Yeah, that's a real nice ass.
- Who's the guy she's with?

64
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,516
That fuckin' guinea.
I hate that little bitch. Will knows him.

65
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,227
Yeah, I do. Yeah, fuckin'
Carmine Scarpaglia.

66
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,480
That guy used to beat the shit
out of me in kindergarten.

67
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,273
- That guy?
- Yeah.

68
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,194
Fuck this. Let's get some food.

69
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:33,031
- What, Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
- Fuck her.

70
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,867
- I could go for a Whopper.
- Let's go to Kelly's.

71
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,828
Morgan, I'm not goin' to Kelly's
just 'cause you like the take-out girl.

72
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,705
It's 15 minutes out of our way.

73
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,333
What the fuck are we gonna do?
We can't spare 15 minutes?

74
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,796
Double burger.

75
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,424
Double burger.

76
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,427
Chuck, I had a double burger.

77
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,639
Would you shut the fuck up?
I know what you ordered. I was there.

78
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,973
So give me my fuckin' sandwich.

79
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,725
What do you mean, your sandwich?
I bought it.

80
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,602
Morgan, how much money you got on you?

81
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,480
I said I'd get change
when I get the snow cone.

82
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,983
I said that when we pulled up.
Give me my sandwich and stop bein' a prick.

83
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,195
All right, give me your fuckin'
16 cents that you got on you now.

84
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,658
We'll put your fuckin' sandwich on layaway.
Here we go. Keep it right up here for ya.

85
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,369
We'll put you on a program.
Every day you come in with your six cents.

86
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,079
At the end of the week,
you get your sandwich.

87
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,415
- Are you gonna be an asshole?
- What am I, fuckin' sandwich welfare?

88
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,876
I think you should establish
a good line of credit.

89
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,754
Like how you bought your couch-
payment plans.

90
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:33,091
Remember how your mother
brought in ten dollars every day for a year.

91
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,051
She finally got her couch
Rent-A-Center style.

92
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,471
- Can I have my food, please?
- Here's your fuckin' double burger.

93
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,061
- Hey, hold up, Chuck. Slow it down.
- Who do we got?

94
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,105
- I don't know yet.
- Hey, douche bag!

95
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,691
Yeah, you, you skank face!

96
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,693
- Shut the fuck up.
- Get outta here.

97
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,194
What are you worried about?

98
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,281
- Come on, Will.
- Why don't you lick my love stick?

99
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,617
We seen the guy 15 minutes ago.
We should've fight him then.

100
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,369
We're eatin' our snacks now.

101
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,537
- Shut up, Morgan, you're goin'.
- I'm not goin'.

102
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,496
So don't go.

103
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,375
- I'm not goin'.
- Fuckin' go, Morgan.

104
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,961
Let me tell you. If you're not
out there in two fuckin' seconds...

105
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,838
when I'm done with them, you're next.

106
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:16,050
Carmine, it's me, Will. Remember?
We went to kindergarten together.

107
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,776
- Fuckin', let's go, man.
- Step on his fuckin' head.

108
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,864
Smash his ass on the ground.
Stomp that motherfucker.

109
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,247
- Motherfucker, die!
- Hit him harder!

110
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,584
- Harder!
- Come on!

111
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,599
Will! Will, cops, Will!

112
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,102
Will, cops. Let's go. Let's go.

113
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,188
Easy, brother, easy.

114
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,943
- Hey, fellas, thanks for comin' out.
- Come here!

115
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,743
Fuck.

116
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,338
Is it just my imagination,
or has my class grown considerably?

117
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,508
By no stretch of my imagination...

118
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,177
do I believe you've all come here
to hear me lecture.

119
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,806
Rather, to ascertain the identity
of the mystery math magician.

120
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:51,104
So without further ado, come forward,
silent rogue, and receive thy prize.

121
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,743
I'm sorry to disappoint my spectators, but...

122
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,621
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today.

123
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,417
However, my colleagues and I
have conferred...

124
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,503
and there is a problem
on the board right now...

125
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,839
that took us more than two years to prove.

126
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,593
So let this be said:
The gauntlet has been thrown down...

127
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:26,681
but the faculty have answered
and answered with vigor.

128
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,697
- Hey, when's the arraignment?
- Next week.

129
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,017
Sorry.

130
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,102
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

131
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,106
That's people's work.
You can't graffiti here.

132
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,984
- Don't you walk away from me!
- Hey, fuck you!

133
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,071
You're a clever one. What's your name?

134
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,428
Oh, my God.

135
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,104
Looks right.

136
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,831
Will, how retarded do you gotta be
to get fired from that job?

137
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,625
How hard is it to push
a motherfuckin' broom around?

138
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,710
Bitch, you got fired
from pushin' a fuckin' broom.

139
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,171
I got fired 'cause management
was restructuring.

140
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,966
Yeah, restructuring the amount of retards
they had workin' for 'em.

141
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,051
Shut up. You get canned
more than tuna, bitch.

142
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,387
At least I got a motherfuckin' job
right now, don't I?

143
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,721
Yeah.

144
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,891
- Why did you get fired, Will?
- Management was restructuring.

145
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,271
My uncle could probably
get you on a demo team.

146
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,605
- Can he do that?
- You kiddin' me?

147
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,649
I asked you yesterday if I could get a job.

148
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,902
- And I told you "no" yesterday.
- What's up, Casey?

149
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,237
- What's up, Case?
- What's up, Big Case?

150
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,200
Let's sit over here.

151
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,378
This is a Harvard bar, huh?

152
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,881
I thought there'd be
equations and shit on the walls.

153
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,636
I will take a pitcher
of the finest lager in the house.

154
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,731
Time out. I'm gonna have to bust a little move
on them Harvard honeys down the end of the bar.

155
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,818
- Work some magic.
- Get some potion for us.

156
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,794
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hello.

157
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,088
- Hi. How are ya?
- Fine.

158
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,049
- So, do you ladies-
- Come here often?

159
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,092
Do I come here? I come here a bit.

160
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,179
I'm here, you know, from time to time.

161
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,723
- Do you go to school here?
- Yep.

162
00:16:55,806 --> 00:17:01,062
- Yeah, that's it. I think I had a class with you.
- Oh, yeah. What class?

163
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,064
- History.
- Maybe.

164
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,066
Yes, I think that's what it was.

165
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,819
You don't necessarily-
may not remember me. I like it here.

166
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,489
It doesn't mean 'cause I go here,
I'm a genius. I am smart.

167
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,907
Hey.

168
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,784
- Hey, how's it goin'? How are ya?
- Good. How ya doin'?

169
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,453
What class did you say that was?

170
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,455
- History.
- Yeah.

171
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,084
Just history?
It must have been a survey course then.

172
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,169
- Yeah, it was. It was surveys.
- Right.

173
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,505
You should check it out.
It's a good course. It'd be a good class.

174
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,175
- How'd you like that course?
- You know, frankly...

175
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,929
- I found that class rather elementary.
- Elementary.

176
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,014
- I don't doubt that it was.
- Yeah.

177
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,101
I remember that class.

178
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,604
It was just between recess and lunch.

179
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,190
Clark, why don't you go away?

180
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,442
- Why don't you relax?
- Why don't you go away?

181
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,529
- I'm just havin' fun with my new friend.
- Are we gonna have a problem?

182
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,156
No, no, no. There's no problem here.

183
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,702
I was just hoping you might
give me some insight into the evolution...

184
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,955
of the market economy
in the southern colonies.

185
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:06,502
My contention is that prior to
the Revolutionary War, the economic modalities-

186
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,338
especially in the southern colonies-

187
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,008
could most aptly be characterized as...

188
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,051
- agrarian precapitalist.
- Let me tell you somethin'.

189
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,429
Of course that's your contention.
You're a first-year grad student.

190
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:20,057
You just got finished readin' some
Marxian historian- Pete Garrison, probably-

191
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,852
You're gonna be convinced of that till
next month when you get to James Lemon.

192
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,980
Then you're gonna be talkin' about how
the economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania...

193
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,191
were entrepreneurial
and capitalist way back in 1740.

194
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,653
That's gonna last until next year.
You're gonna be regurgitatin' Gordon Wood...

195
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,781
talkin' about, you know,
the prerevolutionary utopia...

196
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,868
and the capital-forming effects
of military mobilization.

197
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:44,582
As a matter of fact, I won't, because Wood
drastically underestimates the impact of-

198
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:48,085
Wood drastically underestimates
the impact of social distinctions...

199
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:51,422
predicated upon wealth,
especially inherited wealth?

200
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,718
You got that from Vickers'
<i>Work in Essex County,</i> Page 98, right?

201
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,387
I read that too. Were you gonna plagiarize
the whole thing for us?

202
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:02,058
Do you have any thoughts
of your own on this matter?

203
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,269
Or is that your thing? You come into a bar.
You read some obscure passage.

204
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,189
Then pretend- Pawn it off as your own-

205
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,859
As your own idea just to impress some girls?
Embarrass my friend?

206
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,613
See, the sad thing
about a guy like you is, in 50 years...

207
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,615
you're gonna start doin'
some thinkin' on your own.

208
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,409
You're gonna come up with the fact that
there are two certainties in life.

209
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,161
One: Don't do that.

210
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,289
And two: You dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin' education...

211
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,376
you could've got for $1 .50 in late charges
at the public library.

212
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,172
Yeah, but I will have a degree...

213
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:37,051
and you'll be servin' my kids fries at
a drive through on our way to a skiing trip.

214
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,555
Maybe, but at least I won't be unoriginal.

215
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:46,268
If you have a problem with that, we could
step outside. We could figure it out.

216
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:51,273
No, man, there's no problem. It's cool.

217
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,566
- It's cool?
- Yeah.

218
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,611
- Cool.
- Damn right, it's cool.

219
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,114
How do you like me now?

220
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,535
My boy's wicked smart.

221
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,373
You spend three minutes in this fuckin' place,
you run into a barney, huh?

222
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,293
There it is.

223
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,337
- Nice to meet you.
- They were fine, man.

224
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:17,675
I was gonna close the deal,
but then Chuck- Billy insulted one of 'em-

225
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,512
The heavyset girl said I had a receding hairline,
and I was a few pounds overweight.

226
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,931
And I was, like, "Go fuck yourself."

227
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,934
I swallowed a bug.

228
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,062
Hi.

229
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:33,107
- You're an idiot.
- What?

230
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,776
You're an idiot. I've been sitting
over there for 45 minutes...

231
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,528
waiting for you to come and talk to me.

232
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,905
But I'm tired now, and I have to go home.

233
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,533
I couldn't sit there anymore
waiting for you.

234
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,577
- I'm Will.
- Skylar.

235
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,579
- Skylar.
- Oh, and by the way...

236
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,957
that guy over there- Michael Bolton clone-

237
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,001
He wasn't sitting with us, so to speak.

238
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,379
- I know. I kinda got that impression.
- Good. Okay.

239
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,423
Well, I've got to go.

240
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:01,761
Gotta get up early and waste some more
money on my overpriced education.

241
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,013
- No, I didn't mean you.
- That's all right.

242
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,725
There's my number.
Maybe we can go out for coffee sometime.

243
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,437
All right, yeah. Maybe we could just
get together and eat a bunch of caramels.

244
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,439
- What do you mean?
- When you think about it...

245
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:18,360
- it's as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.
- Yeah. Okay.

246
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,488
Right, then.

247
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:25,159
Oh, come on. You're kidding.

248
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,538
Yo!

249
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,499
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Fuck you.

250
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,794
There goes them fuckin' barneys
right now with his skiin' trip.

251
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,254
- Hold up.
- We should've beat that old bitch's ass.

252
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,014
Do you like apples?

253
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,226
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

254
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,397
I got her number!
How do you like them apples?

255
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,500
Excuse me?
Is this the Buildings and Grounds office?

256
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,837
Yeah. What can I do for you?

257
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,964
I just need the name
of a student who works here.

258
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,466
- No students work for me.
- Could you please check?

259
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,719
I have this guy who works in my building.

260
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,429
- He's about this high.
- Which one is your building?

261
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:12,266
- Two.
- <i>Two.</i> Building two.

262
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,357
- If anything was stolen, I should know.
- No, it's nothing like that.

263
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,651
I just need his name.

264
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,613
I can't give you his name
unless you have a complaint.

265
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,699
- This is Professor Lambeau.
- And this is Professor Hayes.

266
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,743
Tom, please.

267
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,915
This is important. Please.

268
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,293
Willy didn't show for work today.

269
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,963
Got this job through his P.O.
You can call him.

270
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:47,092
- P.O.?
- Yeah. Parole officer.

271
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,057
Thank you.

272
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,268
Asshole.

273
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:03,651
There is a lengthy legal precedent,
Your Honor, going back to 1789...

274
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:06,820
whereby a defendant can claim self-defense
against an agent of the government...

275
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:10,282
if that act is deemed a defense against
tyranny, a defense of liberty.

276
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:15,412
Your Honor, Henry Ward Beecher in <i>Proverbs
from the Plymouth Pulpit,</i> 1887, said-

277
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,288
1887?

278
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,207
- Excuse me.
- This is the 20th century.

279
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,291
He's gonna make a mockery.

280
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:22,544
I am afforded the right to
speak in my own defense, sir...

281
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,380
by the Constitution of the United States.

282
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,216
- Don't tell me about the Constitution.
- This guarantees my liberty.

283
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,802
"Liberty," in case you've forgotten,
is a soul's right to breathe.

284
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,388
When it cannot take a long breath,
laws are girded too tight.

285
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,765
- Without liberty, man is a syncope.
- Man is a what?

286
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,018
- Ibid., Your Honor.
- Son, my turn.

287
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:42,773
I've been sitting here for 10 minutes now
lookin' over this rap sheet of yours.

288
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:46,860
I just can't believe it.
June '93, assault.

289
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,029
September '93, assault.

290
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:52,700
Grand theft auto, February of '94.

291
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:56,996
Where, apparently, you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing...

292
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:01,291
"free property rights
of horse and carriage" from 1798.

293
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,920
Joke.January '95,
impersonating an officer.

294
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:08,966
Mayhem, theft, resisting. All overturned.

295
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,970
I'm also aware that you've been
through several foster homes.

296
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:16,974
The state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse.

297
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:21,478
Another judge might care,
but you hit a cop. You're going in.

298
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:25,024
Motion to dismiss is denied. $50,000 bail.

299
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,692
Thank you.

300
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,360
Court arise.

301
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,032
- Hello?
- <i>Skylar?</i>

302
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,242
- Yep.
<i>- Hey, it's Will.</i>

303
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,994
- Who?
<i>- It's Will.</i>

304
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,164
The really funny, good-looking guy
you met at the bar the other night.

305
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,876
I don't recall meeting anyone who matches
that description. I think I'd remember.

306
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,421
All right, you got me.
It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser...

307
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,423
who got hammered
and wouldn't leave you alone all night.

308
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,593
Oh, Will! I remember.

309
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,555
How are you?
I was wondering if you'd call me.

310
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,016
<i>- Yeah, look, I was wondering-</i>
- Yo, what's up, baby?

311
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:03,187
- Hold on one second.
- What you doing? Want some of my ass?

312
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,189
Herve, I remember you from juvi.

313
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,857
- How you doing?
- What you doing?

314
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,234
<i>Oh, yeah, sorry about that.</i>

315
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,071
I was wonderin' maybe
we could get together sometime this week.

316
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,531
<i>Sit out at a café
Maybe have some caramels.</i>

317
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,116
That sounds wonderful.

318
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,952
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Yeah, sure. Where are you?

319
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:22,039
Actually, this is just a shot in the dark...

320
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:26,335
but there's no chance
that you're pre-law, is there?

321
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,508
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

322
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,511
Nice talking to ya.

323
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,224
What the fuck do you want?

324
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:43,102
I'm Gerald Lambeau.

325
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,020
The professor you told to fuck himself.

326
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,941
What the fuck do you want?

327
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,488
I've spoken to the judge, and he's agreed
to release you under my supervision.

328
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,990
- Really?
- Yeah.

329
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,915
- Under two conditions.
- What are those?

330
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,626
First condition is
that you meet with me every week.

331
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,046
- What for?
- Go over the proof you're working on...

332
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,508
get into some more advanced...

333
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,929
combinatorial mathematics...

334
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,973
finite math.

335
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,060
Sounds like a real hoot.

336
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,066
And the second condition is
that you see a therapist.

337
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,241
I'm responsible to submit reports
on those meetings.

338
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:44,371
If you fail to meet with any of those
conditions, you will have to serve time.

339
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:48,876
I'll do the math, but I'm not gonna
meet with any fuckin' therapist.

340
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:52,880
It's better than spending that time
in jail, isn't it?

341
00:28:56,526 --> 00:29:00,781
I read your book, and "Mike"
was havin' the same problems...

342
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,116
that "Chad," the stockbroker, was havin'.

343
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,203
Absolutely right.
Right on the button. Good for you, Will.

344
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,247
- Very nice.
- Thank you.

345
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,250
Will, the pressures-
And I'm not judging them.

346
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,169
I'm not labeling them-

347
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,130
But they are destroying your potential.

348
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:22,261
No more shenanigans.
No more tomfoolery. No more ballyhoo.

349
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:27,182
You're right. God, I know.

350
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,103
You're not gonna get off that easily.
Come on, Will. A bit more.

351
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:36,191
- Well, I do do things, you know?
- What kind of things?

352
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,860
I do things that-
I hide from people.

353
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:44,408
- You hide, do you?
- No, no. I go places. I interact.

354
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,493
- Really? What sort of places?
- Just certain clubs.

355
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,662
More. That's nice. Yes.
What sort of clubs?

356
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,123
Like, like Fantasy.

357
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,710
Fantasy. That's nice. A bit more.

358
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,463
It's something like when you get in there,
the music owns you.

359
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,008
It's like that house music.
It's like-

360
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,430
- You start dancin'.
- Boom, boom, boom. Yes.

361
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,849
It's just-

362
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:10,559
Yes.

363
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,773
Do you find it hard to hide
the fact that you're gay?

364
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,735
What are you talking about? What?

365
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,529
Look, buddy, two seconds ago,
you were ready to give me a jump.

366
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,865
A jump? Are you-

367
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,160
I'm terribly sorry to disappoint you.

368
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,996
I don't have a problem with it.
I don't care if you putt from the rough.

369
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,958
What? Putting from the rough?
What on earth are you talking about?

370
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:39,546
A difficult theorem
can be like a symphony.

371
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,966
It's very erotic.

372
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,385
You go somewhere else.
I can't handle this.

373
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,637
- Wow.
- Thank you, Henry.

374
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,600
- Henry.
- Hi, Gerry.

375
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,102
You know something?
I can't do this pro bono work anymore.

376
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,688
- It's not worth it.
- What happened?

377
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,690
I'm going on national
television next week.

378
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:02,277
I haven't got time to tell you,
much less talk to that raving looney in there.

379
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,071
An absolute lunatic, he is.

380
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,660
<i>Okay, you are in your bed, Will.</i>

381
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:14,373
Now, how old are you?

382
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,417
Seven.

383
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,419
What do you see?

384
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,924
Something's in my room.

385
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,593
What is it?

386
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:31,681
It's a figure.
It's hoverin' over me.

387
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:35,310
You are in a safe place, Will.

388
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,814
It's touchin' me.

389
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,441
Where is it touching you?

390
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,403
It's touching me down there...

391
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,989
and I'm nervous.

392
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:51,827
You don't have to be nervous, Will.

393
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,747
We start dancin' and dancin'.

394
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,833
It's just beautiful...

395
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,751
'cause we can make...

396
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:04,589
a lot of love before the sun goes down.

397
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:09,428
<i>Skyrockets in flight</i>

398
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:12,264
<i>Afternoon delight</i>

399
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,809
<i>- Hey, hey, hey Afternoon delight</i>
- Jesus.

400
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:19,813
<i>Skyrockets in flight
Da-da-da-da</i>

401
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,858
- I'm sorry, Rich.
- I have better things to do with my time.

402
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,987
<i>Hey, hey Afternoon delight</i>
Come on! One dance!

403
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,948
You really hypnotized me, you know?

404
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,534
- For God's sake, Will.
- What? Oh, come on. He left.

405
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,580
- You can't pin that on me.
- I told you to cooperate with these people.

406
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,541
- Look into my eyes.
- Get out, Will.

407
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,210
I don't need therapy.

408
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,962
That's enough. Get out!

409
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:50,427
- I called Mel Weintraub this morning to see-
- What's the use?

410
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,429
What do you want to do?

411
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:59,060
- There is someone.
- Who is he?

412
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:03,857
He used to be my roommate
in college.

413
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:11,948
Trust. Very important in a relationship.

414
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,992
It's also very important
in a clinical situation.

415
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,912
Why is trust the most important thing...

416
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,623
in making a breakthrough with a client?

417
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:26,087
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.

418
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,677
Because-

419
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,847
Trust is- Trust is life.

420
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:39,559
Wow. That's very deep. Thank you, Vinnie.

421
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,312
Next time, get the notes
from your brother.

422
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,815
If a patient doesn't feel safe enough
to trust you, then they won't be honest with you.

423
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,068
Then there's really no point
for them being in therapy.

424
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,363
Hey, if they don't trust you,
you're never gonna get them to sleep with you.

425
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:55,283
That should be the goal of any good therapist.
Nail 'em while they're vulnerable.

426
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,077
That's my motto.

427
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,704
Oh, good, everyone's back.
Welcome back, everybody.

428
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,876
- Hello, Sean.
- Hey, Gerry.

429
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,092
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the presence of greatness.

430
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:16,137
Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field's medal
winner for combinatorial mathematics.

431
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,015
- Hello.
- Anyone know what the Field's medal is?

432
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,893
It's a really big deal.
It's like the Nobel prize for math.

433
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:26,982
Except they only give it out
once every four years. It's a great thing.

434
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,193
It's an amazing honor.
Okay, everybody, that's it for today.

435
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:33,655
Thanks. We'll see you Monday.
We'll be talking about Freud.

436
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:37,117
Why he did enough cocaine
to kill a small horse. Thank you.

437
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,621
- How are you?
- It's good to see you.

438
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,623
Good to see you.

439
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:47,294
- Sean, I think I got something interesting for ya.
- Yeah?

440
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,921
What, you have to have blood and urine?
What's up?

441
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,340
Why didn't you come to the reunion?

442
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,885
You know, I've been busy.

443
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,887
- You were missed.
- Really?

444
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:00,932
So how long has it been
since we've seen each other?

445
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:04,269
- Before Nancy died.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

446
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,022
I was in Paris.
It was that damn conference.

447
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,815
I got your card. It was nice.

448
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,031
- Come here.
- Now that's a good takedown.

449
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:20,035
Hey, what happened?
Did you get leniency or what?

450
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:24,831
I got probation
and then counseling two days a week.

451
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:28,543
Joke. You're a smoothie.
Come on, Morgan! Just submit!

452
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,839
Hey, Bill,just get off him.
We're gonna miss the game.

453
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,924
- I've got a full schedule. I'm very busy.
- Sean.

454
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:38,011
This boy is incredible.
I've never seen anything like him.

455
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,721
What makes him so incredible, Gerry?

456
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,602
- You ever heard of Ramanujan?
- Yeah, yeah. No.

457
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:50,398
It's a man. He lived over 100 years ago.
He was Indian.

458
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,401
- Dots, not feathers.
- Not feathers. Yeah.

459
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,362
He lived in this tiny hut
somewhere in India.

460
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,906
He had no formal education.

461
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,450
- He had no access to any scientific work.
- Coffee?

462
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,786
- You, sir?
- Just a little.

463
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,288
- But he came across this old math book...
- Thanks.

464
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,957
And from this simple text,
he was able to extrapolate theories...

465
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,918
that had baffled mathematicians for years.

466
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,088
Yes. Continued fractions. He wrote-

467
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:17,300
- He mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge.
- Yeah, Cambridge. Yeah.

468
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,679
And Hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work...

469
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:24,349
and brought him over to England,
and then they worked together for years...

470
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,893
creating some of the most
exciting math theory ever done.

471
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:32,273
This Ramanujan,
his genius was unparalleled, Sean.

472
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,110
This boy's just like that.

473
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:40,532
But he's a bit defensive.

474
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,575
I need someone who can get through to him.

475
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,162
- Like me?
- Yeah, like you.

476
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:49,290
- Why?
- Because you have the same kind of background.

477
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,711
- What background?
- You're from the same neighborhood.

478
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:55,505
- He's from Southie?
- Yeah.

479
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:59,008
Boy genius from Southie.

480
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:03,221
- How many shrinks you go to before me?
- Five.

481
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:07,642
- Let me guess. Barry? Henry? Not Rick?
- Yeah. Yeah.

482
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,812
Sean, please,just meet
with him once a week.

483
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,897
Please?

484
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,154
It's a poker game with this kid.
Don't let him know what you've got.

485
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,365
He probably even read your book,
if he could find it.

486
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,743
It's gonna be hard for him to find.

487
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,327
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.

488
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,288
This is Sean Maguire. Will Hunting.

489
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,331
How are ya?

490
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,671
- Yeah. Let's get started.
- Yeah, let's do it.

491
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,840
I'm pumped. Let's let the healing begin.

492
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:42,469
- Would you excuse us?
- Yeah, please, Tom.

493
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,138
You, too, Gerry.

494
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,140
Yeah, of course.

495
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,481
How are you?

496
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,860
Where you from in Southie?

497
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,821
- I like what you've done with the place.
- Thanks.

498
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,157
Do you buy all these books retail...

499
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,328
or do you send away for, like, a "shrink kit"
that comes with all these volumes included?

500
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,997
- Do you like books?
- Yeah.

501
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,167
- Did you read any of these books?
- I don't know.

502
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,961
- How about any of these books?
- Probably not.

503
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,757
What about the ones on the top shelf?
You read those?

504
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,761
- Yeah, I read those.
- Good for you. What do you think about 'em?

505
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,680
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.
They're your books. Why don't you read 'em?

506
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,557
I did. I had to.

507
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:33,144
- Must've taken you a long time.
- Yeah, it did.

508
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:44,739
<i>United States of America..
A Complete History. Volume I.</i>

509
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:58,670
Jesus. If you wanna read
a real history book...

510
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,713
read Howard Zion's <i>A People's History
of the United States.</i>

511
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,674
That book'll fuckin'
knock you on your ass.

512
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,759
Better than Chomsky's
<i>Manufacturing Consent?</i>

513
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:09,639
- Do you think that's a good book?
- You fuckin' people baffle me.

514
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:13,184
You spend all your money on these fuckin'
fancy books. You surround yourselves with 'em.

515
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:16,855
- They're the wrong fuckin' books.
- What are the right fuckin' books, Will?

516
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:21,276
- Whatever blows your hair back.
- Yeah. Haven't got much hair left.

517
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,945
Hey, you know you'd be better off
shoving that cigarette up your ass.

518
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,155
- It'd probably be healthier for you.
- Yeah, I know.

519
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,617
- It really gets in the way of my yoga.
- You work out, huh?

520
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,662
- What, you lift?
- Yeah.

521
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,206
- Nautilus?
- No, free weights.

522
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,708
- Really? Free weights, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, big time.

523
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,042
- Yeah?
- Just like that.

524
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,628
- What do you bench?
- 285. What do you bench?

525
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,133
You paint that?

526
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,093
Yeah. Do you paint?

527
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:50,179
- Do you sculpt?
- No.

528
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:53,057
Do you like art?

529
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:57,478
- Do you like music?
- This is a real piece of shit.

530
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,480
Oh, tell me what you really think.

531
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:05,194
Just the linear and impressionistic mix
makes a very muddled composition.

532
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:09,490
It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off,
except you got whitey rowin' the boat there.

533
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,492
It's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

534
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,037
- That's not really what concerns me though.
- What concerns you?

535
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,539
- Just the coloring.
- You know what the real bitch of it is?

536
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,708
It's paint-by-number.

537
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,210
Is it color-by-number?
Because the colors are fascinating to me.

538
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:22,754
- Aren't they really?
- You bet.

539
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,507
I think you're about one step away from
cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.

540
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,217
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

541
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:31,930
Think I should move to the south
of France, change my name to "Vincent"?

542
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,890
You ever heard the ea yin',
"any port in a storm"?

543
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,350
Yeah.

544
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,394
- Yeah, maybe that means you.
- In what way?

545
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,939
Maybe you're in the middle of a storm,
a big fuckin' storm.

546
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,023
Yeah, maybe.

547
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,151
The sky's fallin' on your head.
The waves are crashin' over your little boat.

548
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,320
The oars are about to snap.

549
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,364
You just piss in your pants.
You're or yin' for the harbor.

550
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,699
So maybe you do
what you gotta do to get out.

551
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,077
Maybe you became a psychologist.

552
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,664
Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.
You start with me. Come on.

553
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,252
- Maybe you married the wrong woman.
- Maybe you should watch your mouth!

554
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,508
Watch it right there, chief, all right?

555
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,601
That's it, isn't it?

556
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,645
You married the wrong woman.

557
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:26,901
What happened? What, did she leave you?

558
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:30,029
Was she banging some other guy?

559
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,784
If you ever disrespect my wife again,
I will end you.

560
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,953
I will fuckin' end you.

561
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,913
Got that, chief?

562
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,542
Time's up.

563
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,919
Yeah.

564
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,184
At ease, gentlemen.

565
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:08,234
You okay?

566
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:17,618
Look, I'll understand
if you don't wanna meet with him again.

567
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:21,414
Thursday, 4:00. Make sure the kid's here.

568
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,252
Yeah. Thanks.

569
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,946
You look lovely in those glasses.

570
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,948
- Thank you very much.
- They're just beautiful.

571
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:40,993
- Yes, I always wanted dark blue eye shadow.
- Wonderful.

572
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,999
Growing up in England,
I went to a very nice school.

573
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:52,338
You know, it was kind of progressive,
organic, do-it-yourself, private school.

574
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:56,926
Then Harvard. Hopefully med school.

575
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,928
I figured out, at the end...

576
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:03,266
my brain's gonna be worth $250,000.

577
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,309
That sounded horrible, didn't it?

578
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,564
Bring me another mai tai!

579
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,901
Nah, that's cool.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.

580
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:17,864
No, I was happy to pay.
I inherited the money.

581
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:21,325
Wow. Is Harvard gettin' all that money?

582
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:24,453
No, Stanford.
I'm going there in June when I graduate.

583
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:28,791
All right, so you just wanted
to use this sailor and then run away, huh?

584
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:32,837
I was gonna experiment on you
for anatomy class first, obviously.

585
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,256
In that case, that's fine.

586
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,092
- Hey, you wanna see my magic trick, Skylar?
- Of course.

587
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:41,345
All right. Promise to-

588
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,723
All right.

589
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:47,476
- This one's for you, Rudolph.
- Wait, wait. You need my wand.

590
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,396
All right, give me a hit.
Thank you. All right.

591
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,356
I'm gonna make
all these caramels disappear.

592
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,234
You ready? Ready.

593
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,904
One, two, three.

594
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,990
They're all gone.

595
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,576
That was my-
It works better when I have my rabbit.

596
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,662
Well-

597
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:09,373
I don't really date, you know, that much.

598
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:12,251
How very unfortunate... I think for me.

599
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:17,757
You know what I mean?
I know you've been thinking about it.

600
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,759
- Oh, no, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

601
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,219
- No, I really haven't.
- Yes, you have.

602
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,845
You were hoping
to get a good night kiss.

603
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:25,723
No, you know, I tell ya,
I was hopin' to get a good night lay.

604
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,686
But I'll settle for a kiss, you know?

605
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,564
- How very noble of you.
- Thank you.

606
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:37,151
No, I was hopin' for a kiss.

607
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,947
I think we should
just get it out of the way now.

608
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:45,201
- Right now?
- Yeah.

609
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,203
Come on.

610
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,464
I think I got some of your pickle.

611
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,477
You again, huh?

612
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,648
Come with me.

613
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:25,741
So what's this?
A Taster's Choice moment between guys?

614
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:31,622
This is really nice. You got a thing
for swans? Is this a fetish?

615
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,041
Is it something maybe
we need to devote some time to?

616
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,505
Thought about what you said
to me the other day. About my painting.

617
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,302
Stayed up half the night
thinking about it.

618
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,638
Something occurred to me.

619
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:52,268
I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep and
haven't thought about you since.

620
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,354
- You know what occurred to me?
- No.

621
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:59,942
You're just a kid. You don't have
the faintest idea what you're talking about.

622
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,153
- Why, thank you.
- It's all right.

623
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,614
You've never been out of Boston.

624
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,702
Nope.

625
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,954
So if I asked you about art,
you'd probably give me the skinny...

626
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:14,623
on every art book ever written.

627
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:18,461
Michelangelo? You know a lot about him.

628
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:22,173
Life's work, political aspirations.
Him and the pope.

629
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,467
Sexual orientation.
The whole works, right?

630
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:31,557
I'll bet you can't tell me
what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

631
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:37,730
You never actually stood there
and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.

632
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,943
Seen that.

633
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,945
If I ask you about women...

634
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:48,657
you'll probably give me a syllabus of
your personal favorites.

635
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:51,702
You may have even been laid a few times.

636
00:47:56,749 --> 00:48:00,002
But you can't tell me what it feels like
to wake up next to a woman...

637
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:02,546
and feel truly happy.

638
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,593
You're a tough kid.

639
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:13,224
I ask you about war, you'd probably throw
Shakespeare at me, right?

640
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,769
"Once more into the breach, dear friends."

641
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,939
But you've never been near one.

642
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,901
You've never held
your best friend's head in your lap...

643
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:28,447
and watch him gasp
his last breath lookin' to you for help.

644
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:33,744
If I asked you about love,
you'd probably quote me a sonnet...

645
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:39,750
but you've never looked
at a woman and been totally vulnerable.

646
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:42,795
Known someone that could
level you with her eyes.

647
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:48,676
Feelin' like God put
an angel on Earth just for you...

648
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,970
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell.

649
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:54,348
And you wouldn't know
what it's like to be her angel...

650
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,102
to have that love for her
be there forever.

651
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,981
Through anything. Through cancer.

652
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,025
And you wouldn't know about sleepin'
sittin' up in a hospital room...

653
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,194
for two months, holding her hand...

654
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:09,196
because the doctors
could see in your eyes...

655
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,782
that the terms "visiting hours"
don't apply to you.

656
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,078
You don't know about real loss...

657
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:19,832
'cause that only occurs when you love
something more than you love yourself.

658
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:25,212
I doubt you've ever dared
to love anybody that much.

659
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:31,760
I look at you,
I don't see an intelligent, confident man.

660
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:38,309
I see a cocky, scared shitless kid.

661
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:43,397
But you're a genius, Will.
No one denies that.

662
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:47,026
No one could possibly understand
the depths of you.

663
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,154
But you presumed to know everything
about me because you saw a painting of mine.

664
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,698
You ripped my fuckin' life apart.

665
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,746
You're an orphan, right?

666
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:06,962
Do you think I'd know the first thing
about how hard your life has been-

667
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:09,632
how you feel, who you are-

668
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,842
because I read Oliver Twist?

669
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:15,513
Does that encapsulate you?

670
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,768
Personally, I don't give a shit
about all that, because-

671
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,978
You know what?
I can't learn anything from you...

672
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:25,523
I can't read in some fuckin' book.

673
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,443
Unless you wanna talk about you...

674
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,445
who you are.

675
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:36,909
And I'm fascinated. I'm in.

676
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,913
But you don't wanna do that,
do you, sport?

677
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,085
You're terrified of what you might say.

678
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,134
Your move, chief.

679
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,038
Hello? Hello?

680
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,999
Hello?

681
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:10,002
Professor Valenti,
are you calling me again?

682
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,840
Freak.

683
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,347
- Oh, fuck.
- Christ, who did you call?

684
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,932
- No one. I forgot the number.
- You fuckin' retarded?

685
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:26,560
You went all the way out there in the rain,
and you didn't bring the number?

686
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:30,564
No, it was your mother's 900 number.
I just ran out of quarters.

687
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:33,192
Why don't we get of four mothers?
I just got off yours.

688
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,402
That's pretty funny, Morgan.

689
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,946
That's a fuckin' nickel, bitch.

690
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,240
- Keep antagonizing me. Watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

691
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:42,159
- Watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

692
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,244
Keep fuckin' with me.

693
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,378
No smoking.

694
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:26,995
What do you mean, he didn't talk?
You were in there for an hour.

695
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:30,332
He just sat there counting the seconds
until the session was over.

696
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:33,085
- Pretty impressive, actually.
- Why would he do that?

697
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:37,172
To prove to me he doesn't have to
talk to me if he doesn't want to.

698
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:41,176
What is this? Some kind of staring contest
between two kids from the old neighborhood?

699
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:45,013
Yeah, it is, and I can't talk first.

700
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:50,060
We know your theory, Alexander, but the boy's
found a simple geometrical picture.

701
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:53,147
- A tree structure won't work.
- Look now. He's joining the two vertices.

702
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,733
But I can do the sum.

703
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,277
- It's how you group the terms, Alexander.
- But, Gerry.

704
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,279
If we do the whole thing this way, then-

705
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,115
Hey, look, look.

706
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:06,618
I wrote it down. It's simpler this way.

707
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:20,090
Sometimes people get lucky.

708
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,134
You're a brilliant man.

709
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:02,007
You know, I was on this plane once...

710
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,927
and I'm sittin' there, and...

711
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,929
the captain gets on,
he does his whole, you know...

712
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,598
"We'll be cruisin' at 35,000 feet," but
then he puts the mike down.

713
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,351
He forgets to turn it off.

714
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,311
So he turns to the copilot. He's, like...

715
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:19,107
"You know, all I could use right now is
a fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee."

716
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:21,777
So the stewardess fuckin' goes
bombin' up from the back of the plane...

717
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,487
to tell him the microphone's still on.

718
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,907
This guy in the back of the plane's like,
"Hey, hon, don't forget the coffee."

719
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,452
You ever been on a plane?

720
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:33,539
No, but it's a fuckin' joke. It works
better if I tell it in the first person.

721
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:35,541
Yeah, it does.

722
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,671
I have been laid, you know?

723
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,965
Really? Good for you.

724
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,008
- Big time, big time.
- Big time, huh?

725
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:48,220
I went on a date last week.

726
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:51,265
- How'd it go?
- It was good.

727
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,267
- Goin' out again?
- I don't know.

728
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,060
- Why not?
- Haven't called her.

729
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:58,438
- Christ, you're an amateur.
- I know what I'm doin'.

730
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:02,818
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doin'.

731
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,362
Yeah, but this girl was, like,
you know, beautiful.

732
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:09,783
She's smart. She's fun. She's different
from most of the girls I've been with.

733
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:13,704
- So call her up, Romeo.
- Why? So I can realize she's not that smart?

734
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,164
That she's fuckin' boring?
I mean, you don't-

735
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:19,626
This girl's, like, fuckin' perfect right now.
I don't wanna ruin that.

736
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:23,630
Maybe you're perfect right now.
Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.

737
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,676
But I think that's a super philosophy, Will.

738
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:31,513
That way, you can go through your entire life
without ever having to really know anybody.

739
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,811
My wife used to fart when she was nervous.

740
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:40,939
She had all sorts
of wonderful idiosyncrasies.

741
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:43,609
You know, she used to fart in her sleep.

742
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:46,528
Just thought I'd share that with you.

743
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:49,156
One night it was so loud,
it woke the dog up.

744
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,995
She woke up and gone, like,
"Was that you?"

745
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:58,248
I said, "Yeah." I didn't have the heart
to tell her. Oh, God.

746
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:00,500
- She woke herself up?
- Yes.

747
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:10,844
Oh, Christ. But, Will, she's been dead
two years, and that's the shit I remember.

748
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:14,139
It's wonderful stuff, you know?
Little things like that.

749
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:18,185
Yeah, but those are the things
I miss the most.

750
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,188
Those little idiosyncrasies
that only I knew about.

751
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,857
That's what made her my wife.

752
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:27,235
Boy, and she had the goods on me too.
She knew all my little peccadillos.

753
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:31,782
People call these things "imperfections,"
but they're not.

754
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:34,618
That's the good stuff.

755
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:38,038
And then we get to choose who we let into
our weird little worlds.

756
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,333
You're not perfect, sport.

757
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:44,127
And let me save you the suspense.

758
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:47,464
This girl you met,
she isn't perfect either.

759
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:51,385
But the question is whether or not
you're perfect for each other.

760
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:55,764
That's the whole deal.
That's what intimacy is all about.

761
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,766
Now you can know
everything in the world, sport...

762
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,936
but the only way you're findin' out
that one is by givin' it a shot.

763
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,730
You certainly won't learn
from an old fucker like me.

764
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:06,775
Even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell a pissant like you.

765
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,486
Yeah, why not?

766
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:13,323
You told me every other fuckin' thing.
Jesus Christ.

767
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:16,159
Fuckin' talk more than
any shrink I ever seen in my life.

768
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:20,288
I teach the shit.
I didn't say I knew how to do it.

769
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:22,332
Yeah.

770
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:30,716
- You ever think about gettin' remarried?
- My wife's dead.

771
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,885
- Hence the word "remarried."
- She's dead.

772
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:39,808
Yeah, well, I think
that's a super philosophy, Sean.

773
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,060
That way, you can actually go
through the rest of your life...

774
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:44,771
without ever really knowing anybody.

775
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,401
Time's up.

776
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,168
- Hold it open.
- Okay.

777
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,670
Thanks.

778
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:24,728
<i>I am happy with you</i>

779
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:28,815
<i>I know I'm about
to love you</i>

780
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:34,112
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know him</i>

781
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:37,574
<i>Oh, my, you made me-</i>

782
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,952
"G" minor seventh. Saddest of all chords.

783
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,206
- Hello.
- Hey.

784
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:48,543
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry. I've been really busy, and-

785
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:51,213
- But-
- Me too.

786
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:55,217
Yeah. I thought you'd call.

787
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,427
Yeah.

788
00:59:57,511 --> 01:00:00,847
- We had a really good time.
- I had a really good time too.

789
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,100
I mean, I just-

790
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,310
I'm sorry, you know. I blew it.

791
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:07,521
No. No, it's all right.

792
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,732
Yeah, so, I was wonderin' if...

793
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,776
if you know, you'd give me
another crack at it.

794
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,403
Let me take you out again.

795
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:18,156
- I can't.
- All right.

796
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,618
Oh, no, I didn't mean I can't, like, ever.

797
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,662
I just can't right now.

798
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:26,748
I've got to assign
the proton spectrum for "ebogamine."

799
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:30,836
Although it sounds really, really interesting.
It's actually fantastically boring.

800
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:33,755
- All right.
- Maybe some other time.

801
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:37,884
- Like tomorrow?
- Yeah, all right.

802
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:40,387
- Okay.
- Okay.

803
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,848
- Bye.
- Bye.

804
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:57,070
What are you doing here?

805
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,406
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

806
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,450
Where the fuck did you get this?

807
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:04,619
I had to sleep with someone in your class.

808
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:08,540
I hope it was the one with the open-toed
sandals and the really bad breath.

809
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:14,337
- Come on. Let's go have some fun.
- No, I've got to learn this.

810
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:17,090
You're not going into
surgery tomorrow, are you?

811
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,176
- No.
- Let's go.

812
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:26,725
Oh, my God! My dog is winning!

813
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,102
Come on, Misty!

814
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,897
Come on! Run!
Look at that! Come on!

815
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,899
Look, there he goes. Misty, run! Come on!

816
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:40,447
- We won.
- He totally won.

817
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,618
So did you grow up around here then?

818
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,912
Not far. South Boston.

819
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,416
Still glowing from my win.

820
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:53,418
Look at you. You're so happy.

821
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,255
And what was that like then?

822
01:01:57,339 --> 01:02:00,967
It was normal, I guess. Nothin' special.

823
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,221
Do you got lots of brothers and sisters?

824
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:07,515
- Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
- That's what I said.

825
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:13,188
- Irish Catholic, what do you think?
- Right. That's right.

826
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,775
- How many?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

827
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,821
- Why? Go on. What? Five?
- No.

828
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:25,158
Seven? Eight? How many?

829
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:27,410
- I have 12 big brothers.
- You do not!

830
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:30,330
No, I swear to God.
I swear to God. I'm lucky 13 right here.

831
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,332
Do you know all their names?

832
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,001
Do I- Yeah, they're my brothers.

833
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:37,170
What are they called?

834
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:41,591
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy,Joey, Robby,Johnny and Brian.

835
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:44,094
Say it again.

836
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:48,306
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy,Joey, Robby,Johnny and Brian.

837
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:50,976
And Willy.

838
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,352
- Willy?
- Yeah.

839
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,979
- Will.
- Wow.

840
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,816
- Do you still see all of them?
- Yeah, they all live in Southie.

841
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,776
- I'm livin' with three of 'em right now.
- Oh, yeah?

842
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,028
- Yeah.
- I'd like to meet them.

843
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,406
Yeah, we'll do that.

844
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:07,075
I read your book last night.

845
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,703
Oh, so you're the one.

846
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:13,081
- Do you still counsel veterans?
- No, I don't.

847
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:15,333
- Why not?
- I gave it up when my wife got sick.

848
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:23,425
You ever wonder what your life
would be like if you never met your wife?

849
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:25,468
What? Wonder if I'd be
better off without her?

850
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,637
- No, no, I'm not saying, like, better off.
- No.

851
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:31,725
- I didn't mean it like that.
- It's all right. It's an important question.

852
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,060
'Cause you'll have bad times,
but that'll always wake you up...

853
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:36,396
to the good stuff you weren't
paying attention to.

854
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:39,065
And you don't regret meetin' your wife?

855
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:41,818
Why? 'Cause the pain I feel now?

856
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:46,323
I got regrets, Will, but I don't
regret a single day I spent with her.

857
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:54,497
So when did you know
that she was the one for you?

858
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:57,292
October 21, 1975.

859
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,461
Jesus Christ. You know the fuckin' day?

860
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:03,131
Oh, yeah, 'cause it was game six
of the World Series...

861
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,549
biggest game in Red Sox history?

862
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:05,884
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

863
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:09,721
<i>My friends and I had slept out
all night to get tickets.</i>

864
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:13,266
- You got tickets?
- Yep. Day of the game we're was sittin' in a bar...

865
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:16,853
<i>waitin' for the game to start
and in walks this girl.</i>

866
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:20,273
It was an amazing game though.
Bottom of the eighth, Carbo ties it up.

867
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:22,484
It was 6-6. It went to 12.

868
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:26,363
<i>Bottom of the 12th,
in stepped Carlton Fisk, old Pudge.</i>

869
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:28,531
<i>Steps up to the plate.
He's got that weird stance.</i>

870
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:32,202
- Yeah, yeah.
- And then- Boom! He clocks it, you know.

871
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,954
High fly ball down the left field line!

872
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:37,582
35,000 people on their feet,
yellin' at the ball.

873
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:40,168
<i>But that's no thin; 'cause Fisk, he's
wavin' at the ball like a madman.</i>

874
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,170
- Yeah, I've seen that.
- "Get over! Get over!

875
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:43,671
- Right.
- Get over!"

876
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:48,134
<i>Then it hits the foul pole.
He goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans-</i>

877
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,303
<i>They charge the field, you know</i>

878
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:52,722
Yeah, and he's fuckin' blowin'
people outta the way.

879
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:54,933
"Get outta the way! Get outta the way!"

880
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:57,310
<i>I can't fuckin' believe you had tickets
to that fuckin' game!</i>

881
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:01,314
- Did you rush the field?
- No, I didn't rush the fuckin' field. I wasn't there.

882
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,357
What?

883
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,401
No, I was in a bar, havin'
a drink with my future wife.

884
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:09,072
You missed Pudge Fisk's home run to have
a fuckin' drink with some lady you never met?

885
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,366
Yeah, but you should have seen her.
She was a stunner.

886
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,952
- I don't care if-
- Oh, no, she lit up the room.

887
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:16,996
- I don't care if Helen of Troy walks into the room.
- Oh, Helen of Troy!

888
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,207
That's game six! Oh, my God,
and who were these friends of yours?

889
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,584
- They let you get away with that?
- They had to.

890
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:25,255
- What did you say to 'em?
- I just slid my ticket across the table.

891
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,425
I said, "Sorry, guys.
I gotta see about a girl."

892
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,677
- "I gotta go see about a girl"?
- Yes!

893
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,720
That's what you said?
They let you get away with that?

894
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:34,931
Oh, yeah. They saw
in my eyes that I meant it.

895
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:38,810
- You're kiddin' me?
- No, I'm not kidding you, Will.

896
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,563
That's why I'm not talkin' right now about
some girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago...

897
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:44,023
and how I always regretted not goin' over
and talkin' to her.

898
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:47,277
I don't regret the 18 years
I was married to Nancy.

899
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,405
I don't regret the six years I had to
give up counseling when she got sick...

900
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:53,199
and I don't regret the last years
when she got really sick.

901
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:56,911
And I sure as hell don't
regret missin' a damn game.

902
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:59,706
That's regret.

903
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,041
Wow!

904
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,716
Would have been nice
to catch that game though.

905
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,343
I didn't know Pudge
was gonna hit a home run.

906
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:18,475
You know, I'm very, very
useful on the court.

907
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:21,644
I'm extremely tall.

908
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:24,606
- You're not that tall.
- I dunk.

909
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:30,695
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?

910
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,697
"It is decidedly so."

911
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:39,454
Why do we always stay here?

912
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:42,123
'Cause it's nicer than my place.

913
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:44,709
Yes, but I've never seen your place.

914
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,003
I know.

915
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,547
When am I gonna meet
your friends and your brothers?

916
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:53,092
They don't really
come down here that much.

917
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:55,303
I think I can make it to South Boston.

918
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:58,973
It's kind of a hike.

919
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:03,144
Is it me you're hiding from them
or the other way around?

920
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:05,730
- All right, we'll go.
- When?

921
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:08,233
I don't know. We'll go sometime next week.

922
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:13,738
What if I said I would not sleep with you
again until you let me meet your friends?

923
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:23,081
I'd say it's 4:30 in the mornin'.
They're probably up.

924
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:26,417
Oh, my God. Men are shameless.

925
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:29,837
If you're not thinking with your wiener,
then you're acting directly on its behalf.

926
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:34,467
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener,
can I get an advance payment?

927
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:39,013
I don't know. Let's ask.
"Outlook does not look good."

928
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:40,056
What?

929
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:42,684
Fuck the- Hey, Chuck.
No. Nothing. Go back to sleep.

930
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:46,020
"Outlook"? That's the same thing that told you
you was gonna play in the N.B.A.

931
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:49,274
Exactly, so look out. You'd better start
buying some season tickets.

932
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:55,029
I plan to. I'm tall.
I like wearing shorts.

933
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,323
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.

934
01:07:57,407 --> 01:08:00,201
- You're not that tall.
- Yes, I am.

935
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:01,953
Maybe I'm all about three points.

936
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:05,623
I'm all about home runs.

937
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:09,002
Stop mixing your sporting metaphors.

938
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,265
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.

939
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:22,348
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.

940
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:25,059
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.

941
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:28,855
Morgan comes runnin' in,
goin', "I don't mind it. I don't mind-"

942
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:34,611
I can't believe you brought Skylar here
when we're fuckin' all bombed and drinkin'.

943
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:37,196
I know, Morgan.
It's a real rarity we be all drinkin'.

944
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,908
My uncle Marty drinks. He'll go on
a bender for six, eight months.

945
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:43,828
Did I ever tell ya what happened to him
when he was drivin' and got pulled over?

946
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:46,205
- I told you guys, right?
- Marty, yeah.

947
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:49,876
Let me tell ya what happened to my
uncle Marty, because you oughta know this.

948
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:53,296
He's always tellin' stories. Every time
we come here he's got another story.

949
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:57,383
But we all heard this one.
Go ahead. Say it anyway.

950
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:02,597
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.
Guess I have the floor now.

951
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,308
My uncle Marty's drivin' home, right?

952
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:10,146
Bombed out of his tree, right?
Just hammered out of his gourd.Just wrecked.

953
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:14,359
This state trooper sees him, pulls him over.
So my uncle's fucked basically.

954
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:16,653
Got him out of the car,
tr yin' to make him walk the line.

955
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:20,573
He gets out of the car, pukes, and the statie's
pretty sure he's over the legal limit.

956
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:24,452
So he's about to throw the cuffs on him
and put him in jail.

957
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:28,623
All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road,
there's this huge fuckin' boom.

958
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:32,168
- Statie gets real spooked. He turns around-
- A gunshot?

959
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:35,213
No. You heard this story before.

960
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,215
Yeah, Morgan, stop. Stop.

961
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:40,593
Some other guy's car had hit a tree.
There was an accident.

962
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:42,637
Anyway-

963
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,806
- How could he hear-
- Shut the fuck up!

964
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:47,850
- You're drivin' him nuts.
- I'm gonna break your neck. Shut up!

965
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:49,894
He told you the story once before.

966
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:52,647
So he tells my uncle,
"Stay here. Don't move."

967
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:56,651
Statie goes runnin' down the road to deal
with the other accident.

968
01:09:56,734 --> 01:10:00,655
After a few minutes of just lyin'
in his own piss and vomit...

969
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,740
my uncle starts wonderin'
what he's doin' there.

970
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:05,326
Gets up, gets in his car
and just drives home.

971
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:08,413
The next mornin'
my uncle's just passed out.

972
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:10,748
He hears this knockin' at the door.

973
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:13,751
So he goes downstairs,
pulls the door open- "What?"

974
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,795
It's the state trooper
that pulled him over.

975
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,797
Statie says, "Fuck you mean, 'What?'

976
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,384
You know what. I pulled you over
last night is what, and you took off."

977
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,011
He's like, "I never
seen you before in my life.

978
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:26,806
I've been home all night with my kids.
I don't know who the fuck you are."

979
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:30,184
He's like, "You know who I am.
Let me in your garage."

980
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:32,603
My uncle's like, "What?" He said,
"You heard me. Let me in your garage."

981
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:35,356
He was like, "All right. Fine." Takes him
out to the garage, opens the door.

982
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:40,611
And there's- The statie's police cruiser
is in my uncle's garage.

983
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:43,197
He was so fuckin'-

984
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,700
He was so fuckin' hammered
he drove the wrong car home.

985
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:49,537
The best part about it is,
the fuckin' state trooper...

986
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,039
was so embarrassed he didn't do anything.

987
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:55,460
He'd been drivin' around all night in
my uncle's Chevelle, lookin' for the house.

988
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:59,547
All right, Chuck,
what the fuck is the point of your story?

989
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,883
He got away. That's the point.

990
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:05,094
- Question-
- Come on. Stop.

991
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,972
- I'm tr yin' to clarify somethin'.
- You're embarrassing.

992
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:10,558
- It doesn't make any sense.
- It does make sense...

993
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,560
if you listen to the story
and quit askin' questions.

994
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:15,980
Morgan, let's see if you can get this one.
I've got a little story for you.

995
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:20,777
All right, there's an old couple in bed,
Mary and Paddie.

996
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:26,407
They wake up on the morning
of their 50th anniversary.

997
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:29,619
Mary looks over and
gazes adoringly at Paddie.

998
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:31,746
She's like, "Oh,Jesus, Paddie.

999
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:34,081
You're such a good-looking feller.
I love ya.

1000
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,542
I want to give ya a little present.

1001
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,587
Anything your little heart desires,
I'm goin' to give it to ya.

1002
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:41,547
What would ya like?"

1003
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:46,302
Paddie's like, "Oh, gee, Mary.
That's a very sweet offer.

1004
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:51,307
Now, in 50 years,
there's one thing that's been missing...

1005
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:55,144
and I would like you
to give me a blow job.

1006
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:58,898
I would like one."
Mary's like, "All right."

1007
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:03,444
She takes her teeth out, puts 'em in the glass.
She gives him a blow job.

1008
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:07,448
Afterwards, Paddie's like, "Yeah, geez,
now that's what I've been missin'.

1009
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:11,410
That was the most beautiful,
earth-shattering thing ever!

1010
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,788
Beautiful, Mary! I love ya!

1011
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:16,791
Is there anything that I can do for you?"

1012
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:21,504
Mary looks up to him and she goes,
"Give us a kiss."

1013
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,881
Oh, my God!

1014
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:27,385
- That's filthy.
- It's not that filthy. I've heard filthier.

1015
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:35,768
- Get off of me!
- All right. See you guys later.

1016
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,770
All right. Take it easy, Bill.

1017
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,649
So, Skylar, thanks for comin' by.

1018
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:43,651
Changed my opinion of Harvard people.

1019
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:47,196
You don't want to rush to judgment on that one,
'cause they're not all like me.

1020
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,991
I'm sure. It was nice to meet ya.

1021
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,743
Take it easy. Slowly back away.

1022
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:56,914
- Oh, come on. Brother.
- I don't know what you're doin', dude.

1023
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:59,667
- You're givin' us a ride.
- What the fuck do I look like to you?

1024
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,170
- Come on, Chuck.
- You're walkin', bitch. Will's takin' the car.

1025
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:06,465
All right, thanks, sucker.
I appreciate it.

1026
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:09,427
I don't know what
you're gettin' all serious about.

1027
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:13,389
- You're droppin' me off first.
- It's really out of the way.

1028
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:16,350
Oh, okay.Just 'cause you don't have to
sleep in your one-room palace tonight...

1029
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:18,352
don't start thinkin' you're bad.

1030
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:20,688
Hey, wait a minute.
You said we were gonna see your place.

1031
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:23,900
- Not tonight.
- Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night.

1032
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:27,570
He knows once you see that shit-hole,
he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.

1033
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:29,697
But I wanted to meet your brothers.

1034
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:32,199
We're gonna do that another time.

1035
01:13:32,283 --> 01:13:34,201
All right.

1036
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,372
Need them keys.

1037
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:42,501
The stewardess hears this,
and goes haulin' ass down the aisle.

1038
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:45,880
I yell, "Don't forget the coffee."

1039
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:48,007
Bullshit! You didn't say that.

1040
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,468
For Christ's sake, Marty, it's a joke.

1041
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,720
- I know someone that actually happened to.
- A joke.

1042
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:54,388
- Gerry.
- Hi.

1043
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,390
- Have trouble findin' the place?
- No, I took a cab.

1044
01:13:56,474 --> 01:14:00,353
Timmy, this is Gerry.
We went to college together.

1045
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,563
How you doin'? Nice to meet ya.

1046
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:04,565
- Pleased to meet you.
- Can I get you a beer?

1047
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:07,109
No,just a Perrier.

1048
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:09,111
That's French for club soda.

1049
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,781
- Club soda, yeah.
- Couple of sandwiches too.

1050
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,783
- Sure.
- Put it on my tab.

1051
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:16,118
You ever plannin' on pa yin' your tab?

1052
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:18,412
Yeah, chief, got the winning
lottery ticket right here.

1053
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,122
- What's the jackpot?
- Twelve million.

1054
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:23,834
- I don't think that'll cover it.
- It'll cover your sex change operation.

1055
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:30,675
- Nuts?
- No, thank you.

1056
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:37,848
So, you wanted to talk about Will.

1057
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:41,811
- It seems to be going well.
- I think so.

1058
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:46,023
Have you talked to him
at all about his future?

1059
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:49,777
No, we haven't gotten into that yet.
We're still bangin' away at the past.

1060
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:53,406
Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing
off the hook with job offers.

1061
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:57,368
- What kind?
- Cutting edge mathematics, think tanks.

1062
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:00,788
The kind of place where a mind like Will's
is given free rein.

1063
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:05,543
That's great that there are offers, but I
don't really think he's ready for that.

1064
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:12,425
I'm not sure you understand, Sean.

1065
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,261
- What don't I understand?
- Here you go, guys.

1066
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:18,556
- Thanks, Tim.
- Yeah, thank you.

1067
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:20,933
Just so you don't get sticky fingers.

1068
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:23,477
Tim, can you help us?

1069
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:26,022
We're tr yin' to settle a bet.

1070
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:30,943
- Ever heard of Jonas Salk?
- Sure. Cured polio.

1071
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,738
- Ever heard of Albert Einstein?
- Hey.

1072
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:39,201
How about Gerald Lambeau?
Ever heard of him?

1073
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:42,997
- No.
- Thank you, Tim.

1074
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,041
- So who won the bet?
- I did.

1075
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:51,505
This isn't about me, Sean.

1076
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:54,425
I'm nothing compared to this young man.

1077
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,847
You ever hear of Gerald Lambeau?

1078
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:04,602
In 1905, there were hundreds of professors
renowned for their study of the universe.

1079
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:09,190
But it was a 26-year-old
Swiss patent clerk...

1080
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:11,901
doing physics in his spare time,
who changed the world.

1081
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,903
Can you imagine if Einstein
would have given that up...

1082
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,489
just to get drunk with his buddies
in Vienna every night?

1083
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:19,200
We all would have lost something.

1084
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:21,285
Tim would never have heard of him.

1085
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:24,455
- Pretty dramatic, Gerry.
- No, it isn't, Sean.

1086
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:27,124
This boy has that gift.

1087
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,668
He just hasn't got the direction,
but we can give that to him.

1088
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:35,049
Hey, Gerry, in the 1960s, there was a young man
graduated from University of Michigan.

1089
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:38,385
Did some brilliant work in mathematics.

1090
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:40,888
Specifically, bounded harmonic functions.

1091
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:44,058
Then he went on to Berkeley. He was
assistant professor. Showed amazing potential.

1092
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:47,019
Then he moved to Montana, and
he blew the competition away.

1093
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:50,022
- Yeah, so who was he?
- Ted Kaczynski.

1094
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:51,982
Haven't heard of him.

1095
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,984
- Hey, Timmy!
- Yo!

1096
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:56,821
- Who's Ted Kaczynski?
- Unabomber.

1097
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:01,826
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1098
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:03,828
- We gotta give this kid direction.
- Yeah-

1099
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:06,247
He can contribute to the world,
and we can help him do that.

1100
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,374
Direction's one thing.
Manipulation's another.

1101
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,417
- Sean-
- We have to let him find-

1102
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:14,130
I'm not sitting at home every night
twisting my mustache and hatching a plan...

1103
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:16,173
to ruin this boy's life!

1104
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:18,634
I was doing advanced mathematics
when I was 18...

1105
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:21,178
and it still took me over 20 years to do
something worthy of a Field's medal.

1106
01:17:21,262 --> 01:17:23,681
Maybe he doesn't want what you want.

1107
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:26,517
There's more to life
than a fuckin' Field's medal.

1108
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,521
This is too important, Sean,
and it's above personal rivalry.

1109
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:33,023
Wait a minute. Let's talk about the boy.

1110
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:35,818
Why don't we give him time
to figure out what he wants?

1111
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:39,155
That's a wonderful theory, Sean.
It worked wonders for you, didn't it?

1112
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:41,866
Yeah, it did, you arrogant fuckin' prick!

1113
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:46,704
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
that I came here today.

1114
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,914
I came here out of courtesy.
I wanted to keep you in the loop.

1115
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,125
Nice to be in the loop.

1116
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:54,712
The boy's in a meeting
right now I set up for him over at McNeil.

1117
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:59,300
Will, I'm not exactly sure
what you mean.

1118
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:01,760
We've already offered you a position.

1119
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:03,846
Nobody in this town works
without a retainer, guys.

1120
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:07,183
You think you can find somebody who does,
you have my blessin'.

1121
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:10,519
But I think we all know that person is not
gonna represent you as well as I can.

1122
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:13,731
Will, our offer is $84,000 a year.

1123
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:18,527
Retainer! Retainer.

1124
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:21,363
You want us to give you cash right now?

1125
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:25,492
Whoa-ho-ho. Easy- Now, I didn't say that.

1126
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:30,831
Allegedly, your situation, for you...

1127
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:34,710
would be concurrently improved if I had...

1128
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:37,463
$200 in my back pocket right now.

1129
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:42,551
I don't think I can- Larry?

1130
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:46,805
- I've got $73.
- Will you take a check?

1131
01:18:48,432 --> 01:18:51,685
Let me tell you somethin'. You're suspect.

1132
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:57,066
Yeah, you. I don't know
what your reputation is in this town...

1133
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,860
but after the shit
you tried to pull today...

1134
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:02,529
you can bet I'll be lookin' into you.

1135
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:07,534
Now, any business we have heretofore...

1136
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:10,287
you can speak with
my aforementioned attorney.

1137
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:13,666
Good day, gentlemen.

1138
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:17,461
And until that day comes,
keep your ear to the grindstone.

1139
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,727
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

1140
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:35,854
Yeah.

1141
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:37,856
Good.

1142
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:41,568
- Want some help?
- No!

1143
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:44,822
Come on. Give me one little peek, and
we'll go to the batting cages.

1144
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:47,074
No.

1145
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:50,828
It is actually important
that I learn this.

1146
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:54,665
- It's really important... to me, okay?
- All right.

1147
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:59,670
- Why don't we just hang out here all day?
- Yes, why don't we?

1148
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,718
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker.

1149
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,762
Seeing as you're intent
on breaking my balls...

1150
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:14,226
- let me ask you a question.
- All right.

1151
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,228
Do you have a photographic memory?

1152
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:22,318
I don't know. I just kind of remember.
How do you remember your phone number?

1153
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:24,320
You just do.

1154
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:27,281
- Have you studied organic chemistry?
- A little bit.

1155
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:30,284
- Oh,just for fun?
- Yeah, for kicks.

1156
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:32,911
Yeah, it's so much fun
studying organic chemistry.

1157
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:35,622
Are you mad?

1158
01:20:35,706 --> 01:20:38,208
Have you completely lost your mind?

1159
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:42,880
Nobody studies it for fun. It's not a necessity,
especially for someone like you.

1160
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:45,424
- Someone like me?
- Yeah.

1161
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:49,762
Someone who divides their time, fairly
evenly, between batting cages and bars.

1162
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:54,350
I would hardly say it was a necessity.

1163
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:57,227
You know, there are very
smart people here at Harvard.

1164
01:20:57,311 --> 01:21:01,273
Even they have to study,
because this is really hard.

1165
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:07,029
And yet... you do it so easily.
I don't understand.

1166
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:09,156
I don't understand how your mind works.

1167
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:11,492
- Do you play the piano?
- I want to talk about this.

1168
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:13,702
No, I'm trying to explain it to you.
Do you play the piano?

1169
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:18,332
- Yeah, a bit.
- So when you look at a piano, you see Mozart.

1170
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:22,002
- I see "Chopsticks."
- All right, Beethoven, okay?

1171
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:25,839
He looked at a piano, and it just made
sense to him. He could just play.

1172
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:28,342
- So what are you saying? You play the piano?
- Not a lick.

1173
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:32,262
I look at a piano, I see a bunch of keys,
three pedals and a box of wood.

1174
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:37,142
But Beethoven, Mozart-
They saw it. They could just play.

1175
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:41,188
I couldn't paint you a picture. I probably
can't hit the ball out of Fenway.

1176
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:42,773
And I can't play the piano.

1177
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:45,359
But you can do my
O-chem paper in under an hour.

1178
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:50,781
Right. When it came to stuff like that,
I could always just play.

1179
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,619
That's the best I can explain it.

1180
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:59,706
Come here. I have to tell you something.

1181
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:01,291
I have to tell you something.

1182
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:04,545
Well-

1183
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:23,730
- It's not fair.
- What's not fair? What?

1184
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:26,900
I've been here for four years...

1185
01:22:26,984 --> 01:22:28,902
and I've only just found you.

1186
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:32,823
Well, you found me.

1187
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:48,505
- Are you awake?
- No.

1188
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:51,967
Yes, you are.

1189
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:57,848
Will, come to California with me.

1190
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:01,435
What?

1191
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:06,565
I want you to come to California with me.

1192
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:16,074
- You sure about that?
- Oh, yeah.

1193
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:19,244
Yeah, but how do you know?

1194
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:23,457
I don't know. I just know.

1195
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:26,293
Yeah, but how do you know?

1196
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:30,547
I know because I feel it.

1197
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:34,384
- Because that's a really serious thing you're saying.
- I know.

1198
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:36,929
You could be in California next week...

1199
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:40,182
and you might find out
something about me you don't like.

1200
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:42,309
Maybe you wish you hadn't said that...

1201
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:44,770
but you know it's such a serious thing
you can't take it back.

1202
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:47,981
Now I'm stuck in California with someone
that doesn't really want to be with me...

1203
01:23:48,065 --> 01:23:52,611
- just wish they had a take-back.
- A what? What's a take-back?

1204
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:58,492
I don't want a take-back. I just want you
to come to California with me.

1205
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:02,371
I can't go to California with you, so-

1206
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:05,332
Why not?

1207
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:09,545
One, because I got a job here.

1208
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:11,588
And, two, because I live here.

1209
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:16,385
Look, if you don't love me,
you should just tell me.

1210
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:19,471
I'm not ea yin' I don't love you.

1211
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:24,726
Then why? Why won't you come?
What are you so scared of?

1212
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:27,688
What am <i>I</i> so scared of?

1213
01:24:27,771 --> 01:24:30,524
What aren't you scared of?

1214
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:33,569
You live in this safe little world where
no one challenges you-

1215
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:37,531
Don't tell me about my world.
Don't tell me about my world.

1216
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:40,200
You just want to have your little fling
with the guy from the other side of town.

1217
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:43,078
Then you're gonna go off to Stanford.
You're gonna marry some rich prick...

1218
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:45,080
who your parents will approve of...

1219
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:47,165
and just sit around with
the other trust fund babies...

1220
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:49,209
and talk about how you
went slummin', too, once.

1221
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:54,506
Why are you saying this?
What is your obsession with this money?

1222
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:59,094
My father died when I was 13,
and I inherited this money.

1223
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:04,558
You don't think every day I wake up, and I
wish I could give it back?

1224
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:08,312
That I would give it back in a second,
if it meant I could have one more day with him.

1225
01:25:08,395 --> 01:25:11,773
But I can't, and that's
my life, and I deal with it.

1226
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:15,068
So don't put your shit on me
when you're the one that's afraid.

1227
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:17,738
I'm afraid? What am I afraid of?
What the fuck am I afraid of?

1228
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:20,324
You're afraid of me.
You're afraid that I won't love you back.

1229
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:22,576
You know what? I'm afraid too.

1230
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:25,787
But fuck it, I want to give it a shot.
At least I'm honest with you.

1231
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:29,708
- I'm not honest with you?
- No, what about your 12 brothers?

1232
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,085
All right.

1233
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:34,296
No, you're not going. You're not leaving.

1234
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:35,547
What do you want to know?

1235
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:38,508
That I don't have 12 brothers?
That I'm a fuckin' orphan?

1236
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:40,636
- You don't want to hear that.
- I didn't know that.

1237
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:43,930
You don't want to hear I got fuckin'
cigarettes put out on me when I was little.

1238
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:46,391
- I didn't know that.
- That this isn't fuckin' surgery.

1239
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:49,436
The motherfucker stabbed me.
You don't want to hear that shit, Skylar!

1240
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:51,772
- I do want to hear that.
- Don't tell me you want to hear that shit!

1241
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:55,025
- I want to help you.
- Help me? What the fuck?

1242
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:57,861
What do I got, a fuckin' sign on my back
that says, "Save me"?

1243
01:25:57,944 --> 01:25:59,863
- No.
- Do I look like I need that?

1244
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:01,948
- No, I just want to be with you-
- Don't bullshit me!

1245
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:06,036
- I love you.
- Don't bullshit me! Don't you fuckin' bullshit me!

1246
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:09,039
I love you.

1247
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:14,127
I want to hear you say
that you don't love me.

1248
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:16,338
Because if you say that...

1249
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:21,802
then I won't call you...

1250
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:24,179
and I won't be in your life.

1251
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:32,562
I don't love you.

1252
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:17,691
Most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be.

1253
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:20,527
They don't find teachers
who believe in them.

1254
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:22,529
They get convinced they're stupid.

1255
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:27,242
I hope you appreciate what he's doing...

1256
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:31,872
because I've seen how much he enjoys
working with you, not against you.

1257
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,546
Hello, Will.

1258
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:41,882
Tom, can you get us some coffee?

1259
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:43,925
Sure.

1260
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:51,391
Now, let's see.

1261
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,774
Good. This is correct.

1262
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:02,611
I see you used Maclaurin here.

1263
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:05,739
Yeah, I don't know what you call it, but-

1264
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:08,158
This can't be right.

1265
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:14,122
This would be very embarrassing.

1266
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:20,128
- Did you ever consider-
- I'm pretty sure it's right.

1267
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:22,380
Hey, look, can we
do this at Sean's office from now on?

1268
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:26,551
Because I got to knock off work to come
here and the commute is killin' me.

1269
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:30,263
- Yeah. Did you think of the possibility-
- It's right.

1270
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:34,851
It's right.Just take it home with you.

1271
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,690
What happened at the McNeil meeting?

1272
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:42,734
I couldn't go. I had a date.

1273
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:45,987
So I sent my chief negotiator.

1274
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:53,495
On your own time,
you can do whatever you like, Will.

1275
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:56,206
But when I set up a meeting
with my associates...

1276
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:58,959
and you don't show up,
it reflects poorly on me.

1277
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:01,211
- Then don't set up any more meetings.
- I won't.

1278
01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:03,713
I'll cancel 'em.

1279
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:06,299
I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted
you to see what was out there.

1280
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:10,595
Maybe I don't want to spend the rest of my
fuckin' life explainin' shit to people.

1281
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:20,105
I think you could show me
some appreciation.

1282
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:24,651
A little appreciation?
Do you know how easy this is for me?

1283
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:28,029
Do you have any fuckin' idea
how easy this is? This is a fuckin' joke.

1284
01:29:28,113 --> 01:29:30,198
I'm sorry you can't do this- I really am-

1285
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:33,869
Because I wouldn't have to fuckin' sit here
and watch you fumble around and fuck it up.

1286
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:42,836
Then you'd have more time to sit around
and get drunk instead, wouldn't you?

1287
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:47,465
You're right. This is probably
a total waste of my time.

1288
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:03,815
You're right, Will.

1289
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:10,572
I can't do this proof, but you can.

1290
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:14,701
And when it comes to that, it's only about
just a handful of people in the world...

1291
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:16,870
who can tell the difference
between you and me.

1292
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:19,205
- But I'm one of them.
- Sorry.

1293
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:21,374
Yeah, so am I.

1294
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:24,461
Most days I wish I never met you...

1295
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:29,299
because then I could sleep at night.

1296
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:34,721
I didn't have to walk around with the knowledge
that there was someone like you out there.

1297
01:30:41,645 --> 01:30:46,107
And I didn't have to watch you
throw it all away.

1298
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:57,619
Bill, hold it. Did you hear that?

1299
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:02,415
If you're watchin' pornos
in my mom's room again...

1300
01:31:02,499 --> 01:31:05,168
I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'!

1301
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:24,104
What's up, fellas?

1302
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:28,775
Morgan, why don't you jerk off in your own
fuckin' house. That's fuckin' filthy.

1303
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:32,988
I don't have a V.C.R. in my house.

1304
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:35,740
Come on. Not in my glove.

1305
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:38,201
I didn't use the glove.

1306
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:41,830
That's my Little League glove.

1307
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:45,333
What do you want me to do?

1308
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:47,544
I mean, what's wrong with you?

1309
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:49,796
You'll hump a baseball glove?

1310
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:53,008
I-I just used it for cleanup.

1311
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:56,803
Stop jerkin' off in my mother's room.

1312
01:31:56,886 --> 01:32:00,056
- Is there another V.C.R. in the house?
- It's just sad, bro.

1313
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:06,646
So why do you think I should work for the
National Security Agency?

1314
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:09,816
You'd be working on the cutting edge.

1315
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:13,278
You'd be exposed to the kind of technology
you wouldn't see anywhere else...

1316
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:15,947
because we've classified it.

1317
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:19,659
Superstring theory,
chaos math, advanced algorithms.

1318
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:22,662
Code breaking.

1319
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:25,540
That's one aspect of what we do.

1320
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:28,251
Oh, come on. That is what you do.

1321
01:32:28,334 --> 01:32:30,754
You guys handle 80% of
the intelligence workload.

1322
01:32:30,837 --> 01:32:33,339
You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.

1323
01:32:33,423 --> 01:32:39,220
We don't like to brag about that, Will,
but you're exactly right.

1324
01:32:39,304 --> 01:32:43,183
So the way I see it, the question isn't:

1325
01:32:43,266 --> 01:32:45,894
"Why should you work for the N.S.A.?"

1326
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:48,438
The question is: "Why shouldn't you?"

1327
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:52,400
Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.?

1328
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:56,404
That's a tough one, but I'll take a shot.

1329
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:59,199
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.
and somebody puts a code on my desk.

1330
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:01,201
Something no one else can break.

1331
01:33:01,284 --> 01:33:03,203
Maybe I take a shot at it,
and maybe I break it.

1332
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:05,830
I'm real happy with myself
because I did my job well.

1333
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:09,459
But maybe that code was the location of some
rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East.

1334
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:12,587
Once they have that location, they bomb
the village where the rebels are hidin'.

1335
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:16,883
Fifteen hundred people that I never met,
never had no problem with, get killed.

1336
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:19,928
Now the politicians are saying,
"Send in the Marines to secure the area"...

1337
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:21,930
'cause they don't give a shit.

1338
01:33:22,013 --> 01:33:23,932
It won't be their kid
over there gettin' shot...

1339
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:26,976
just like it wasn't them when their number
got called 'cause they were in the National Guard.

1340
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:29,896
It'll be some kid from Southie
over there takin' shrapnel in the ass.

1341
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:31,981
He comes back to find the plant
he used to work at...

1342
01:33:32,065 --> 01:33:34,526
got exported to the country
he got back from...

1343
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:36,903
and the guy who put
the shrapnel in his ass got his old job...

1344
01:33:36,986 --> 01:33:39,864
'cause he'll work for 15 cents a day
and no bathroom breaks.

1345
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:42,534
Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason he
was over there in the first place...

1346
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:45,745
was so we could install a government that
would sell us oil at a good price.

1347
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:49,833
Of course, the oil companies used a skirmish
over there to scare up domestic oil prices.

1348
01:33:49,916 --> 01:33:54,003
A cute little ancillary benefit for them,
but it ain't helpin' my buddy at 2.50 a gallon.

1349
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:56,422
They're takin' their sweet time
bringin' the oil, of course.

1350
01:33:56,506 --> 01:33:58,591
Maybe they even took the liberty to hire
an alcoholic skipper...

1351
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:01,886
who likes to drink martinis
and fuckin' play slalom with the icebergs.

1352
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:04,222
It ain't too long till
he hits one, spills the oil...

1353
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:06,766
and kills all the sea life
in the North Atlantic.

1354
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:09,102
So now my buddy's out of work,
he can't afford to drive...

1355
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:11,104
so he's walkin' to
the fuckin' job interviews...

1356
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:13,940
which sucks because the shrapnel in his
ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.

1357
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:16,568
Meanwhile, he's starvin', 'cause every
time he tries to get a bite to eat...

1358
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:18,570
the only blue plate special
they're servin'...

1359
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:21,573
is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.

1360
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:26,661
So what did I think?
I'm holdin' out for somethin' better.

1361
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:30,582
I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it,
why not just shoot my buddy...

1362
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:32,584
take his job, give it to his sworn enemy...

1363
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:35,170
hike up gas prices,
bomb a village, club a baby seal...

1364
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:37,922
hit the hash pipe
and join the National Guard?

1365
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:40,550
I can be elected president.

1366
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:43,887
- You feel like you're alone?
- What?

1367
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:47,599
Do you have a soul mate?

1368
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:50,185
Do I have a- Define that.

1369
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,228
Somebody who challenges you.

1370
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:54,480
Chuckie.

1371
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:58,151
No, Chuckie's family.
He'd lie down in fuckin' traffic for you.

1372
01:34:58,234 --> 01:35:03,865
I'm talking about someone who opens up
things for you, touches your soul.

1373
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:07,118
- I got-
- Who?

1374
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:10,246
- I got plenty.
- Name 'em.

1375
01:35:10,330 --> 01:35:13,333
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke-

1376
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:15,627
That's great. They're all dead.

1377
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:18,796
- Not to me they're not.
- You don't have a lot of dialogue with them.

1378
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,300
You can't give back to them, Will.

1379
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:24,719
Not without some serious
smelling salts and a heater.

1380
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:26,721
That's what I'm saying.

1381
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:30,350
You'll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

1382
01:35:30,433 --> 01:35:32,852
where you're always afraid
to take the first step...

1383
01:35:32,936 --> 01:35:36,731
because all you see is every negative
thing 10 miles down the road.

1384
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:38,816
- You gonna take the professor's side on this?
- Don't give me a line of shit.

1385
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,860
- No.
- I didn't want the job.

1386
01:35:40,944 --> 01:35:42,862
It's not about the job. I don't care if
you work for the government.

1387
01:35:42,946 --> 01:35:46,074
But you can do anything you want.
You are bound by nothing.

1388
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:51,204
What are you passionate about?
What do you want?

1389
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:53,623
There are guys who work their entire life
la yin' brick...

1390
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:55,959
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here.

1391
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:58,503
- I didn't ask for this.
- No.

1392
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:01,047
You were born with it, so don't cop out
behind: "I didn't ask for this."

1393
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:04,300
What do you mean, cop out?
What's wrong with la yin' brick?

1394
01:36:04,384 --> 01:36:05,385
Nothing.

1395
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:07,303
There's nothin' wrong.
That's somebody's home I'm buildin'.

1396
01:36:07,387 --> 01:36:10,223
Right. My dad laid brick, okay?

1397
01:36:10,306 --> 01:36:12,225
Busted his ass so
I could have an education.

1398
01:36:12,308 --> 01:36:14,519
Exactly. That's an honorable profession.

1399
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:15,937
What's wrong with fixin' somebody's car?

1400
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:18,481
Someone will get to work the next day
because of me. That's honor in that.

1401
01:36:18,564 --> 01:36:20,525
Yeah, there is, Will.
There is honor in that.

1402
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,902
There's honor in takin'
that 40-minute train ride...

1403
01:36:22,986 --> 01:36:25,488
so those college kids could come in in the
morning and their floors are clean.

1404
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:27,323
And their wastebaskets are empty.
That's real work.

1405
01:36:27,407 --> 01:36:28,574
That's right.

1406
01:36:28,658 --> 01:36:31,661
And that's honorable.
I'm sure that's why you took that job.

1407
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:33,746
For the <i>honor</i> of it.

1408
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:38,459
I just have a little question here.
You could be a janitor anywhere.

1409
01:36:38,543 --> 01:36:42,213
Why did you work at the most prestigious
technical college in the whole fuckin' world?

1410
01:36:42,297 --> 01:36:45,591
Why did you sneak around at night and
finish other people's formulas...

1411
01:36:45,675 --> 01:36:51,597
that only one or two people in the world
could do and then lie about it?

1412
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:54,642
'Cause I don't see
a lot of honor in that, Will.

1413
01:36:57,854 --> 01:37:00,523
So what do you really wanna do?

1414
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:05,778
I wanna be a shepherd.

1415
01:37:05,862 --> 01:37:07,780
Really?

1416
01:37:07,864 --> 01:37:11,826
I wanna move up to Nashua, get a nice
little spread, get some sheep and tend to them.

1417
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:14,829
- Maybe you should go do that.
- What?

1418
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:17,874
If you're gonna jerk off, why don't you
just do it at home with a moist towel?

1419
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:19,917
- You're chuckin' me?
- Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

1420
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:21,961
- No, no, no, time's not up yet.
- Yeah, it is.

1421
01:37:22,045 --> 01:37:24,672
- I'm not leavin'. No.
- You're not gonna answer, you're wastin' my time.

1422
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:26,716
I thought we were friends.

1423
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:30,428
- Playtime's over, okay?
- Why are you kickin' me out?

1424
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:33,806
You're lecturin' me on life?
Look at you, you fuckin' burnout.

1425
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:36,100
- What winds your clock?
- Workin' with you.

1426
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:39,270
Where's your soul mate? You wanna talk
about soul mates? Where is she?

1427
01:37:39,354 --> 01:37:41,481
- Dead.
- That's right. She's fuckin' dead.

1428
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:44,275
She fuckin' dies and you just cash in your
chips and you walk away?

1429
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:45,985
At least I played a hand.

1430
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:48,571
You played a hand and you lost.
You lost a big fuckin' hand.

1431
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:52,033
Some people will lose a big hand like that
and have the sack to ante up again.

1432
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:55,244
Look at me. What do you wanna do?

1433
01:38:02,168 --> 01:38:06,381
You and your bullshit.
You got a bullshit answer for everybody.

1434
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:10,176
But I ask you a very simple question, and
you can't give me a straight answer...

1435
01:38:10,259 --> 01:38:14,263
because you don't know.

1436
01:38:15,932 --> 01:38:18,101
I'll see ya, Bo-peep.

1437
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:23,231
- Fuck you.
- You're the shepherd.

1438
01:38:27,944 --> 01:38:30,196
Shepherd.

1439
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:32,365
White little prick.

1440
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:39,122
I just wanted to call you up
before you left.

1441
01:38:39,205 --> 01:38:41,833
I've been takin' all these
job interviews and stuff...

1442
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:43,835
so I'm not gonna be just
a construction worker.

1443
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:46,629
Well, I never really cared about that.

1444
01:38:48,131 --> 01:38:50,091
Yeah.

1445
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:54,595
I love you.

1446
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:01,394
Will?

1447
01:39:01,477 --> 01:39:04,313
You take care.

1448
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:17,887
Will, come on. Will!

1449
01:40:19,972 --> 01:40:22,058
Will, that's it! We're done!

1450
01:40:22,141 --> 01:40:26,854
I'm sitting in your office,
and the boy isn't here.

1451
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:28,981
It's 10 past 5:00.

1452
01:40:29,065 --> 01:40:31,067
An <i>hour</i> and 10 minutes late.

1453
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:38,032
If he doesn't show up, and
I file a report saying he wasn't here...

1454
01:40:38,115 --> 01:40:42,036
and he goes back to jail,
it won't be on my conscience.

1455
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:48,042
Okay. Fine.

1456
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:51,462
What's up?

1457
01:40:53,422 --> 01:40:55,383
Thanks.

1458
01:40:58,010 --> 01:41:01,931
Fuck, that's good.

1459
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:08,187
So how's your lady?

1460
01:41:08,271 --> 01:41:10,231
She's gone.

1461
01:41:11,190 --> 01:41:13,526
Gone? Gone where?

1462
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:17,238
Med school. Medical school in California.

1463
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:19,240
- Really?
- Yeah.

1464
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:22,285
- When was this?
- It was, like, a week ago.

1465
01:41:26,664 --> 01:41:28,624
That sucks.

1466
01:41:31,627 --> 01:41:35,131
So, when are you done
with those meetings?

1467
01:41:35,214 --> 01:41:37,216
I think the week after I'm 21.

1468
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:40,052
They gonna hooky a up with a job or what?

1469
01:41:40,136 --> 01:41:44,348
Yeah, fuckin' sit in a room and do long
division for the next 50 years.

1470
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:47,810
Nah, probably make some nice bank though.

1471
01:41:47,893 --> 01:41:49,854
I'm gonna be a fuckin' lab rat.

1472
01:41:49,937 --> 01:41:53,274
Better than this shit. Way outta here.

1473
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:55,568
What do I want a way outta here for?

1474
01:41:55,651 --> 01:41:57,903
I mean, I'm gonna fuckin'
live here the rest of my life.

1475
01:41:57,987 --> 01:42:00,072
You know, be neighbors.
You know, have little kids.

1476
01:42:00,156 --> 01:42:02,908
Fuckin' take 'em
to Little League together up Foley Field.

1477
01:42:06,329 --> 01:42:09,749
Look, you're my best friend,
so don't take this the wrong way.

1478
01:42:09,832 --> 01:42:12,710
But in 20 years if
you're still livin' here...

1479
01:42:12,793 --> 01:42:14,712
comin' over to my house
to watch the Patriots games...

1480
01:42:14,795 --> 01:42:18,424
still workin' construction,
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1481
01:42:18,507 --> 01:42:21,052
That's not a threat.
That's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1482
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:23,262
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

1483
01:42:23,346 --> 01:42:26,557
- Look, you got something none of us have.
- Oh, come on!

1484
01:42:26,641 --> 01:42:29,644
Why is it always this? I fuckin'
owe it to myself to do this or that.

1485
01:42:29,727 --> 01:42:34,774
- What if I don't want to?
- No, no. Fuck you. You don't owe it to yourself.

1486
01:42:34,857 --> 01:42:37,109
You owe it to me...

1487
01:42:37,193 --> 01:42:39,737
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna
wake up and I'll be 50...

1488
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:42,239
and I'll still be doin' this shit.

1489
01:42:42,323 --> 01:42:44,909
That's all right. That's fine.

1490
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:47,578
I mean, you're sittin' on
a winnin' lottery ticket.

1491
01:42:47,662 --> 01:42:51,248
You're too much of a pussy to cash it in,
and that's bullshit.

1492
01:42:53,334 --> 01:42:56,212
'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything
to have what you got.

1493
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:59,131
So would any of these fuckin' guys.

1494
01:42:59,215 --> 01:43:01,884
It'd be an insult to us
if you're still here in 20 years.

1495
01:43:01,967 --> 01:43:04,512
Hangin' around here
is a fuckin' waste of your time.

1496
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:06,722
- You don't know that.
- I don't?

1497
01:43:06,806 --> 01:43:07,890
No. You don't know that.

1498
01:43:07,973 --> 01:43:10,267
I don't know that.
Let me tell you what I do know.

1499
01:43:10,351 --> 01:43:14,146
Every day I come by your house,
and I pick you up.

1500
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:18,234
We go out and have a few drinks and few
laughs, and it's great.

1501
01:43:18,317 --> 01:43:20,986
You know what the best part of my day is?

1502
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:25,491
It's for about 10 seconds: from when I pull up
to the curb and when I get to your door.

1503
01:43:25,574 --> 01:43:30,246
'Cause I think maybe I'll get up there
and I'll knock on the door, and you won't be there.

1504
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:33,874
No "good-bye," no "see ya later."
No nothing. You just left.

1505
01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:38,170
I don't know much, but I know that.

1506
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:52,143
This is a disaster, Sean.

1507
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:55,604
I brought you in here because I wanted you
to help me with the boy...

1508
01:43:55,688 --> 01:43:57,815
- not to run him out.
- I know what I'm doing with the boy.

1509
01:43:57,898 --> 01:43:59,859
I don't care if you have
a rapport with the boy!

1510
01:43:59,942 --> 01:44:01,402
I don't care if you have a few laughs.

1511
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:04,029
But don't you dare undermine
what I'm trying to do here.

1512
01:44:04,113 --> 01:44:05,364
Undermine?

1513
01:44:05,448 --> 01:44:07,533
This boy is at a fragile point right now.

1514
01:44:07,616 --> 01:44:10,453
I do understand. He is at a fragile point.
He's got problems.

1515
01:44:10,536 --> 01:44:14,081
What problems does he have? That he's
better off as a janitor, in jail?

1516
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:17,418
Better hanging out with
a bunch of retarded gorillas?

1517
01:44:17,501 --> 01:44:21,422
Why do you think he does that?
You have any fuckin' clue why?

1518
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:25,050
He can handle the problems. He can handle
the work. He obviously handled you.

1519
01:44:25,134 --> 01:44:27,553
Listen to me. Why is he hiding?

1520
01:44:27,636 --> 01:44:30,473
Why doesn't he trust anybody?
Because the first thing that happened to him...

1521
01:44:30,556 --> 01:44:33,684
he was abandoned by the people who were
supposed to love him the most.

1522
01:44:33,768 --> 01:44:35,770
Don't give me that Freudian crap.

1523
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:38,105
Why does he hang out with
those retarded gorillas, as you call them?

1524
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:41,776
Because any one of them, if he asked them
to, would take a bat to your head.

1525
01:44:41,859 --> 01:44:44,737
- That's called loyalty.
- Yeah, that's very touching.

1526
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:47,990
Who's he handling? He pushes people away
before they have a chance to leave him.

1527
01:44:48,073 --> 01:44:50,576
It's a defense mechanism, all right?

1528
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:53,496
For 20 years, he's been
alone because of that.

1529
01:44:53,579 --> 01:44:56,248
If you push him right now, it's gonna be
the same thing all over again.

1530
01:44:56,332 --> 01:44:58,125
I'm not gonna let that happen to him.

1531
01:44:58,209 --> 01:45:00,252
- Don't you do that.
- What?

1532
01:45:00,336 --> 01:45:04,006
Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay
to quit, that it's okay to be a failure.

1533
01:45:04,089 --> 01:45:06,091
Because it's not okay, Sean!

1534
01:45:06,175 --> 01:45:09,970
If you're angry at me for being successful,
for being what you could have been-

1535
01:45:10,054 --> 01:45:12,890
- I'm not angry at you.
- Oh, yes, you're angry at me.

1536
01:45:12,973 --> 01:45:16,977
You resent me, but I'm not gonna apologize
for any success I've had.

1537
01:45:17,061 --> 01:45:19,939
You're angry at me for doing
what you could have done!

1538
01:45:20,022 --> 01:45:22,024
But ask yourself, Sean- Ask yourself...

1539
01:45:22,107 --> 01:45:25,486
if you want Will to feel that way-
if you want him to feel like a failure?

1540
01:45:25,569 --> 01:45:27,696
You arrogant shit!

1541
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:32,159
That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions,
'cause I can't stand that look in your eye.

1542
01:45:32,243 --> 01:45:35,371
- That condescending, embarrassed look.
- Oh, come on, Sean.

1543
01:45:35,454 --> 01:45:37,331
You think I'm a failure. I know who I am.

1544
01:45:37,414 --> 01:45:42,002
I'm proud of what I do. It was a conscious
choice. I didn't fuck up!

1545
01:45:42,086 --> 01:45:44,797
And you and your cronies think
I'm some sort of pity case.

1546
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:48,425
You and your kiss-ass chorus following you
around going, "The Field's medal!"

1547
01:45:48,509 --> 01:45:51,929
Why are you still so
fuckin' afraid of failure?

1548
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:55,975
It's about my medal, isn't it? Oh, God,
I could go get it for you. You can have it.

1549
01:45:56,058 --> 01:45:59,144
Shove the medal up
your fuckin' ass, all right?

1550
01:45:59,228 --> 01:46:01,146
'Cause I don't give
a shit about your medal...

1551
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:03,148
because I knew you before
you were a mathematical god...

1552
01:46:03,232 --> 01:46:06,861
when you were pimple-faced and homesick
and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on.

1553
01:46:06,944 --> 01:46:09,029
Yeah, you were smarter than me then, and
you're smarter than me now.

1554
01:46:09,113 --> 01:46:10,948
So don't blame me for
how your life turned out.

1555
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:13,409
I don't blame you! It's not about you!

1556
01:46:13,492 --> 01:46:16,245
You mathematical dick! It's about the boy!

1557
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:17,830
He's a good kid!

1558
01:46:17,913 --> 01:46:21,417
And I won't see you fuck him up like
you're tr yin' to fuck up me right now.

1559
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:23,919
I won't see you make him
feel like a failure too!

1560
01:46:24,003 --> 01:46:27,548
- He won't be a failure!
- But if you push him! If you ride him!

1561
01:46:27,631 --> 01:46:33,178
I am what I am today because I was pushed
and because I learned to push myself.

1562
01:46:33,262 --> 01:46:35,431
He's not you! You get that?

1563
01:46:37,558 --> 01:46:39,310
I can come back.

1564
01:46:39,393 --> 01:46:43,439
No, come in. I was just leaving.

1565
01:46:53,782 --> 01:46:57,703
A lot of that stuff goes back
a long way between me and him.

1566
01:46:57,786 --> 01:46:59,747
You know. Not about you.

1567
01:47:05,336 --> 01:47:07,087
What is that?

1568
01:47:07,171 --> 01:47:10,966
This is your file. I have to send it
back to the judge for evaluation.

1569
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:16,096
Hey, you're not
gonna fail me, are you?

1570
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:22,061
What's it say?

1571
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:26,148
- Wanna read it?
- Why?

1572
01:47:27,816 --> 01:47:30,903
Have you had any experience with that?

1573
01:47:30,986 --> 01:47:34,573
Twenty years of counseling.
Yeah, I've seen some pretty awful shit.

1574
01:47:34,657 --> 01:47:38,994
I mean, have you had
any experience with that?

1575
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:46,627
- Personally?
- Yeah.

1576
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:48,545
Yeah, I have.

1577
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:50,673
It sure ain't good.

1578
01:47:54,176 --> 01:47:56,178
My father was an alcoholic.

1579
01:47:56,261 --> 01:47:59,139
Mean fuckin' drunk.

1580
01:48:00,808 --> 01:48:03,769
He'd come home hammered,
lookin' to whale on somebody.

1581
01:48:03,852 --> 01:48:08,315
So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't go after
my mother and little brother.

1582
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:12,611
Interesting nights were
when he wore his rings.

1583
01:48:13,612 --> 01:48:17,074
He used to just put a wrench...

1584
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:19,910
a stick and a belt on the table.

1585
01:48:19,994 --> 01:48:24,123
- Just say, "Choose."
- I gotta go with the belt there.

1586
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:26,041
I used to go with the wrench.

1587
01:48:26,125 --> 01:48:28,210
Why the wrench?

1588
01:48:28,293 --> 01:48:30,546
'Cause fuck him, that's why.

1589
01:48:30,629 --> 01:48:34,299
- Your foster father?
- Yeah.

1590
01:48:34,383 --> 01:48:38,303
So, what is it?
Like, Will has an attachment disorder?

1591
01:48:38,387 --> 01:48:40,597
Is it all that stuff?

1592
01:48:40,681 --> 01:48:42,683
Fear of abandonment?

1593
01:48:43,726 --> 01:48:46,645
Is that why I broke up with Skylar?

1594
01:48:46,729 --> 01:48:49,565
- I didn't know you had.
- Yeah, I did.

1595
01:48:50,232 --> 01:48:52,359
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

1596
01:48:56,405 --> 01:49:02,244
Hey, Will, I don't know a lot.

1597
01:49:02,327 --> 01:49:05,748
You see this? All this shit?

1598
01:49:10,753 --> 01:49:12,838
It's not your fault.

1599
01:49:15,132 --> 01:49:17,301
Yeah, I know that.

1600
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:20,345
Look at me, son.

1601
01:49:20,429 --> 01:49:23,932
- It's not your fault.
- I know.

1602
01:49:24,016 --> 01:49:27,436
No. It's not your fault.

1603
01:49:28,729 --> 01:49:30,647
I know.

1604
01:49:30,731 --> 01:49:33,734
No, no, you don't. It's not your fault.

1605
01:49:35,319 --> 01:49:37,279
I know.

1606
01:49:37,362 --> 01:49:40,074
- It's not your fault.
- All right.

1607
01:49:40,157 --> 01:49:42,493
It's not your fault.

1608
01:49:44,495 --> 01:49:49,666
- It's not your fault.
- Don't fuck with me.

1609
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:52,211
It's not your fault.

1610
01:49:52,294 --> 01:49:55,839
Don't fuck with me, all right?
Don't fuck with me, Sean, not you.

1611
01:49:55,923 --> 01:49:58,467
It's not your fault.

1612
01:50:06,183 --> 01:50:07,684
It's not your fault.

1613
01:50:13,982 --> 01:50:17,069
My God-

1614
01:50:17,152 --> 01:50:21,698
My God! I'm so sorry! My God!

1615
01:50:36,004 --> 01:50:38,132
Fuck them, okay?

1616
01:52:04,259 --> 01:52:05,219
Can I help you?

1617
01:52:05,302 --> 01:52:08,347
Yeah, I'm Will Hunting.
I'm here about a position.

1618
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:10,807
Could you just have a seat for a moment?

1619
01:52:14,436 --> 01:52:17,773
Yes, there's a Mr. Hunting in the lobby.

1620
01:52:37,626 --> 01:52:39,878
Which one did you take?

1621
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:44,883
I was over at McNeil. It's one of the jobs
the professor set me up with.

1622
01:52:44,967 --> 01:52:49,346
I haven't told him yet, but I went down
there and talked to my boss-

1623
01:52:49,429 --> 01:52:52,849
My new boss. He seemed like a good guy.

1624
01:52:52,933 --> 01:52:58,313
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah, you know, I think so.

1625
01:52:58,397 --> 01:53:01,400
Good for you. Congratulations.

1626
01:53:01,483 --> 01:53:03,443
Thanks.

1627
01:53:06,488 --> 01:53:08,448
Time's up.

1628
01:53:11,368 --> 01:53:14,621
So that's- So that's it? So we're done?

1629
01:53:14,705 --> 01:53:17,499
Yeah, that's it.

1630
01:53:17,582 --> 01:53:20,460
You're done. You're a free man.

1631
01:53:21,712 --> 01:53:26,425
Well, I just want you to know, Sean, that-

1632
01:53:26,508 --> 01:53:28,510
You're welcome, Will.

1633
01:53:33,682 --> 01:53:36,601
So, you know, I hope
we keep in touch, you know.

1634
01:53:36,685 --> 01:53:39,271
Yeah, me too.

1635
01:53:39,354 --> 01:53:41,857
I'll be travelin' around a bit.
It'll be a little hard, but...

1636
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:45,610
I've got an answering machine
at the college I'll be checking in with.

1637
01:53:45,694 --> 01:53:49,614
So, here's the number.

1638
01:53:49,698 --> 01:53:53,577
You call that. I'll get back
to you right away.

1639
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:56,747
Yeah, you know,
I figured I'm just gonna...

1640
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:59,875
put my money back on the table and see
what kind of cards I get.

1641
01:54:02,669 --> 01:54:05,672
You do what's in your heart, son.
You'll be fine.

1642
01:54:10,135 --> 01:54:12,220
Thank you, Sean.

1643
01:54:12,304 --> 01:54:14,473
Thank you, Will.

1644
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:19,478
Hey, does this violate
the patient-doctor relationship?

1645
01:54:19,561 --> 01:54:21,605
Naw. Only if you grab my ass.

1646
01:54:25,484 --> 01:54:27,569
- Take care.
- You too.

1647
01:54:27,652 --> 01:54:29,696
Yeah.

1648
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:33,408
Hey.

1649
01:54:33,492 --> 01:54:35,869
Good luck, son.

1650
01:54:47,089 --> 01:54:49,883
<i>Two</i> beers.

1651
01:54:52,594 --> 01:54:54,596
What's up? Did you guys go?

1652
01:54:54,679 --> 01:54:57,015
No. I had to talk him down.

1653
01:54:57,099 --> 01:55:00,811
- Why didn't you yoke him?
- Little Morgan's got a lot of scrap to him.

1654
01:55:00,894 --> 01:55:02,813
People try to whip his ass every week.

1655
01:55:02,896 --> 01:55:05,232
- Fuckin' kid won't back down.
- What are you ea yin' about me?

1656
01:55:05,315 --> 01:55:08,819
- Was I talkin' to you?
- Then mind your fuckin' business.

1657
01:55:08,902 --> 01:55:12,155
- Go get me a beer.
- I ordered two beers!

1658
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:14,324
- Hey, asshole.
- What, bitch?

1659
01:55:14,408 --> 01:55:18,120
- Happy birthday.
- Thought we forgot, huh, bitch?

1660
01:55:18,203 --> 01:55:20,831
- Come on!
- I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

1661
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:22,791
All right. Who's first?

1662
01:55:22,874 --> 01:55:25,377
- Come on, motherfucker!
- Who's first?

1663
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:27,295
<i>Oh, Danny boy</i>

1664
01:55:27,379 --> 01:55:29,297
Here's your present.

1665
01:55:31,091 --> 01:55:33,051
- Come on, bro.
- What?

1666
01:55:33,135 --> 01:55:37,389
We knew you had to get back and
forth to Cambridge for your new job.

1667
01:55:37,472 --> 01:55:41,351
I knew I wasn't gonna
fuckin' drive you every day, so-

1668
01:55:41,435 --> 01:55:45,480
- Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.
- That's not what I was ea yin'!

1669
01:55:45,564 --> 01:55:48,066
But, you're 21 now.

1670
01:55:48,150 --> 01:55:51,695
You're legally allowed to drink, so we
figured the best thing for ya was a car.

1671
01:55:51,778 --> 01:55:54,239
- How do you like it?
- This is like-

1672
01:55:56,700 --> 01:56:00,620
It's the ugliest fuckin' car
I've ever seen in my life.

1673
01:56:00,704 --> 01:56:02,622
- Come on, brother.
- How'd you guys do this?

1674
01:56:02,706 --> 01:56:07,752
You know, me and Bill
scraped together the parts...

1675
01:56:07,836 --> 01:56:09,880
and Morgan was out panhandlin'
for change every day.

1676
01:56:09,963 --> 01:56:11,882
I had the router to do all the bodywork.

1677
01:56:11,965 --> 01:56:13,884
Yeah, hell of a fuckin' job, too, brother.

1678
01:56:13,967 --> 01:56:16,511
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a job.
I had to let him help with the car.

1679
01:56:16,595 --> 01:56:18,513
So you finally got a job, huh, Morgan?

1680
01:56:18,597 --> 01:56:20,724
- Yeah, had one. Now I'm fucked again.
- So what is it?

1681
01:56:20,807 --> 01:56:23,602
- A lawn mower? What do ya got?
- It's a straight fuckin' six.

1682
01:56:23,685 --> 01:56:25,437
Me and Bill rebuilt
this engine ourselves here.

1683
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:29,691
It's a good car.
The engine's good. Engine's good.

1684
01:56:29,774 --> 01:56:33,069
- Happy 21, Will.
- Happy 21, brother.

1685
01:56:40,202 --> 01:56:42,078
Hi.

1686
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:45,582
Come on in.

1687
01:56:47,709 --> 01:56:49,628
Sean, I-

1688
01:56:49,711 --> 01:56:51,796
Me too, Gerry.

1689
01:56:52,881 --> 01:56:55,217
Yeah. Good.

1690
01:56:56,301 --> 01:56:58,386
I heard you're takin' some time.

1691
01:56:58,470 --> 01:57:03,099
Yeah. Travel a little bit, maybe write.

1692
01:57:03,183 --> 01:57:05,143
So where are you going?

1693
01:57:05,227 --> 01:57:09,189
India and China and Baltimore.

1694
01:57:12,609 --> 01:57:14,611
You know when you'll be back?

1695
01:57:16,321 --> 01:57:18,031
I got this flyer the other day.

1696
01:57:18,114 --> 01:57:20,992
It says class of '72
is having a reunion in six months.

1697
01:57:21,076 --> 01:57:22,994
Yeah, I got one of those too.

1698
01:57:23,078 --> 01:57:24,955
Why don't you come? I'll buy ya a drink.

1699
01:57:25,038 --> 01:57:27,916
The drinks at those things are free.

1700
01:57:29,084 --> 01:57:31,545
I know, Gerry. I was being ironical.

1701
01:57:37,968 --> 01:57:39,636
How about a drink right now?

1702
01:57:40,929 --> 01:57:42,847
Yeah. It's a good idea.

1703
01:57:42,931 --> 01:57:45,308
Come on. This one's on me.

1704
01:57:48,103 --> 01:57:50,480
I got the winner right here, pal.

1705
01:57:50,564 --> 01:57:53,858
Yes, sir, this is the one.

1706
01:57:53,942 --> 01:57:56,236
This is my ticket to paradise.

1707
01:57:56,319 --> 01:57:58,405
Do you know what the odds
are against winning the lottery?

1708
01:57:58,488 --> 01:58:01,533
- What? Four to one?
- About 30 million to one.

1709
01:58:01,616 --> 01:58:03,702
I still have a shot, you know?

1710
01:58:03,785 --> 01:58:07,539
Yes,just about as big chance
as you being hit by lightning...

1711
01:58:07,622 --> 01:58:09,666
here on the staircase right now.

1712
01:58:09,749 --> 01:58:12,961
It's a possibility too. I mean, 32 million.
If you look at the size-

1713
01:59:42,467 --> 01:59:44,844
Will!

1714
02:00:03,905 --> 02:00:05,865
Will?

1715
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:14,976
He's not there.

1716
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:39,334
<i>Sean, if the professor
calls about that job...</i>

1717
02:01:39,417 --> 02:01:44,005
<i>just tell him,
sorry. I had to go see about a girl.</i>

1718
02:01:44,088 --> 02:01:46,007
<i>Will.</i>

1719
02:01:47,634 --> 02:01:50,970
Son of a bitch. He stole my line.
