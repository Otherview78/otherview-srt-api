1
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:36,203
<i>She shivers in the wind
like the last leaf on a dying tree.</i>

2
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,919
<i>I let her hear my footsteps.</i>

3
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,174
<i>She only goes stiff for a moment.</i>

4
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:51,052
Care for a smoke?

5
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:56,891
Sure. I'll take one.

6
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,644
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?

7
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:05,066
I didn't come here for the party.
I came here for you.

8
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:09,654
I've watched you for days.

9
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:14,492
You're everything a man could ever want.

10
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,036
It's not just your face,

11
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,666
your figure or your voice.

12
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:26,754
It's your eyes.

13
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:31,509
All the things I see in your eyes.

14
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,180
What is it you see in my eyes?

15
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:43,396
I see a crazy calm.

16
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,149
You're sick of running.

17
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,613
You're ready to face
what you have to face.

18
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:56,367
But you don't want to face it alone.

19
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,452
No.

20
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:00,830
I don't want to face it alone.

21
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:11,465
<i>The wind rises electric.</i>

22
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:15,094
<i>She's soft and warm
and almost weightless.</i>

23
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:19,306
<i>Her perfume a sweet promise
that brings tears to my eyes.</i>

24
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:23,394
<i>I tell her that
everything will be all right.</i>

25
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:30,109
<i>That I'll save her from whatever she's
scared of and take her far, faraway.</i>

26
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:36,449
<i>I tell her I love her.</i>

27
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:43,372
<i>The silencer
makes a whisper of the gunshot.</i>

28
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,252
<i>I hold her close until she's gone.</i>

29
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,799
<i>I'll never know
what she was running from.</i>

30
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:59,096
<i>I'll cash her cheque in the morning.</i>

31
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:55,963
<i>Just one hour to go.
My last day on the job.</i>

32
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,883
<i>Early retirement. Not my idea.</i>

33
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,052
<i>Doctor's orders. Heart condition.</i>

34
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:05,222
<i>"Angina," he calls it.</i>

35
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,225
<i>I'm polishing my badge,
getting myself used to the idea</i>

36
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,769
<i>of saying goodbye to it.
It, and 30-odd years</i>

37
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,939
<i>of protecting and serving and tears</i>

38
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:17,484
<i>and blood and terror
and triumph it represents.</i>

39
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,821
<i>I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile.</i>

40
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:24,575
<i>About the thick, fat steaks
she picked up at the butcher's today.</i>

41
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,413
<i>And I'm thinking about
the one loose end I haven't tied up.</i>

42
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,624
<i>A young girl who's out there somewhere,</i>

43
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,460
<i>helpless in the hands
of a drooling lunatic.</i>

44
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,427
Damn it, Hartigan, I won't let you do
this. You're gonna get yourself killed.

45
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,931
You're gonna get us both killed.
I won't let you. I'm warnin' you.

46
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,599
Let go of my coat, Bob.

47
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,018
You're draggin' me down with you.

48
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,522
I'm your partner. They can kill me, too.
I ain't puttin' up with that.

49
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,942
I'm gettin' on the horn,
calling for backup.

50
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:02,071
Sure, Bob. We'll just wait.
Sit on our hands while that Roark brat

51
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:06,492
gets his sick thrills with victim
number four. Victim number four!

52
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:11,288
Nancy Callahan, age 11. And she'll
be raped and slashed to ribbons.

53
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:15,376
And that backup that we're waitin' on
will just so happen to show up

54
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:19,880
just late enough for Roark
to get back to his US senator daddy.

55
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,633
Take a deep breath, Hartigan.

56
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,552
Settle down and think straight.

57
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:29,640
You're pushin' 60
and you got a bum ticker.

58
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,059
You ain't savin' anyone.

59
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,230
You got a great attitude, Bob.

60
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,108
Real credit to the force, you are.

61
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:43,153
Eileen's at home waitin' for you.
Think about Eileen.

62
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,075
Heck, Bob...

63
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,829
...maybe you are right.

64
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,499
I'm glad to hear you're
finally talkin' sense.

65
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,794
<i>Hell of a way to end a partnership.</i>

66
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,588
<i>Hell of a way to start my retirement.</i>

67
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:04,466
<i>Nancy Callahan, age 11.</i>

68
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,011
<i>For all I know, she's dead already.</i>

69
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,016
You've been a very good girl, Nancy.

70
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,476
You've been very quiet.

71
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,603
Don't be scared.

72
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,939
We're gonna be
taking you home soon.

73
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:24,111
But first, we're going
to introduce you to somebody.

74
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,406
He's a very nice man.

75
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:32,661
<i>Halfway to the warehouse where
Weevil said they took her, and it hits.</i>

76
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:35,289
<i>Wicked spot of indigestion.</i>

77
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,624
<i>At least that's what I pray it is.</i>

78
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,127
...light-hearted
and momentary digression.

79
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,130
The briefest indulge-ment
in automotive pleasure.

80
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:47,342
For cheap thrills.
Such short-lived durability, Mr Shlubb.

81
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:51,805
You would risk engender-ating ill will
on the part of our employers.

82
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,058
<i>Burt Shlubb and Douglas Klump:</i>

83
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:58,270
<i>two any-dirty-job-there-is thugs
with delusions of eloquence.</i>

84
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,398
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet,

85
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,984
remanded to our custody,
though it may be,

86
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:07,446
remains the property
of the son of Senator Roark.

87
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,657
<i>Gotta keep this quiet.
Take 'em down fast.</i>

88
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,826
A dent, the merest scratch thereupon,

89
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,954
and before-mentioned consequences
which I made mention

90
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,457
shall surely be athwart us.

91
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:32,137
<i>Catch your breath.
Give your heart time to slow down.</i>

92
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,223
<i>But it won't slow down.</i>

93
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,310
<i>Get over it.</i>

94
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,437
<i>She needs you.</i>

95
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,356
We're all done here, Benny.

96
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,984
Let's give them some time together.
Give them some privacy.

97
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,778
Be with you in a minute, Lenny.

98
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,322
I'm making sure
they get along really well.

99
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:56,036
What kind of beast couldn't get along
with a precious little girl like this?

100
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,373
You must be awfully scared now.

101
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,918
But you've got nothing to be scared of.

102
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,630
All we're gonna do
is have a nice little talk.

103
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:12,511
That's all. Just a nice talk.
Just you and me.

104
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,056
Don't you cry now.

105
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,392
<i>Doctor said it'd be like this.</i>

106
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,644
<i>Just take the pill he gave you.</i>

107
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,864
<i>No need to play it quiet.</i>

108
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,991
<i>Not anymore.</i>

109
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:38,829
<i>Breathe steady, old man.
Prove you're not completely useless.</i>

110
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,040
<i>What the hell?
Go out with a bang.</i>

111
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,750
<i>He likes to hear 'em scream.</i>

112
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,753
<i>I've seen his victims
and their twisted little faces,</i>

113
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:51,675
<i>all wide-mouthed and bug-eyed, frozen
in their last horrible moment of living.</i>

114
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:56,263
<i>No screams. Either I'm just in time,
or I'm way too late.</i>

115
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,903
<i>It's nothing. Barely a flesh wound.
On your feet, old man.</i>

116
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,786
Roark. Give it up.

117
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,122
Let the girl go.

118
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,416
You can't do a goddamn thing to me.

119
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,501
You know who I am.

120
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,795
You know who my father is!

121
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,423
You can't touch me,
you piece-of-shit cop.

122
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:36,345
Look at you. You can't even lift
that cannon you're carrying.

123
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,473
Sure, I can.

124
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:49,983
Cover your eyes, Nancy.
I don't want you watching this.

125
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,111
I mean it, baby.
Cover your eyes right now.

126
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,324
<i>I take his weapons away.</i>

127
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,828
<i>Both of them.</i>

128
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,383
<i>Hell of a way to end a partnership.</i>

129
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,427
For God sakes,
don't make it any worse.

130
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,974
- Don't make me kill you.
- Doin' fine, Bob.

131
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,434
Never better.

132
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,647
I'm ready to kick your ass.

133
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,566
<i>Keep him talking. Buy time.</i>

134
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,319
<i>Just a few more minutes.
Till the backup gets here.</i>

135
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:38,323
Sit down and stay down.
I'll kill you if I have to.

136
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:42,202
<i>Keep his mind off the girl,
skinny little Nancy.</i>

137
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,329
<i>Can't kill her
once backup gets here.</i>

138
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,748
Run home, Nancy.
Run for your life.

139
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,710
Hey. Don't listen to him.
He's a crazy man.

140
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,005
- What a tough man you are.
- You stay right where you're at.

141
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,049
You shoot your partner in the back...

142
00:11:56,133 --> 00:12:00,387
...then you try to scare a little girl.
Maybe I'll pull my spare rod,

143
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,056
plug you a couple of times,
show you how it's done.

144
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,978
We could've worked something out.
Sit down or I'll blast you in half.

145
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,481
- You're so slow, you'll never stop me.
- Sit down!

146
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,401
You'll never be able to stop me.

147
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:26,371
<i>I finally sit down,
just like you told me to.</i>

148
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,208
<i>The sirens are close now.</i>

149
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,587
<i>She'll be safe.</i>

150
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:46,141
<i>Things go dark.
I don't mind much.</i>

151
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,604
<i>Getting sleepy. It's OK.</i>

152
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,981
<i>She'll be safe.</i>

153
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:55,442
<i>An old man dies,</i>

154
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,111
<i>a little girl lives.</i>

155
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,363
<i>Fair trade.</i>

156
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,621
<i>The night is hot as hell.</i>

157
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,041
<i>It's a lousy room
in a lousy part of a lousy town.</i>

158
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,711
<i>I'm staring at a goddess.</i>

159
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,214
<i>She's telling me she wants me.</i>

160
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:21,134
<i>I'm not gonna waste one more second
wondering how I've gotten so lucky.</i>

161
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,803
I want you.

162
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,391
<i>She smells like angels ought to smell.</i>

163
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,022
<i>The perfect woman.</i>

164
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,903
<i>The goddess.</i>

165
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,493
I need you.

166
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,872
<i>Goldie.</i>

167
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,416
<i>She says her name is Goldie.</i>

168
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:04,928
<i>Three hours later and my head
is feeling several sizes too big.</i>

169
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,098
<i>And that cold thing
happens to my stomach.</i>

170
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,977
<i>And I realise Goldie's dead.
Not a mark on her.</i>

171
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,689
<i>You'd have to check her pulse
or notice those perfect breasts of hers</i>

172
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,358
<i>aren't moving like
if she was breathing.</i>

173
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,444
<i>She was murdered
and I was right here when it happened.</i>

174
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:25,782
<i>Lying next to her,
stone drunk, just like she was.</i>

175
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:30,328
<i>Damn it, Goldie. Who were you
and who wanted you dead?</i>

176
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,914
<i>Who were you
besides an angel of mercy,</i>

177
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:36,334
<i>giving a two-time loser like me
the night of his life?</i>

178
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,045
<i>It sure as hell wasn't my looks.</i>

179
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,048
<i>So why the sleazy saloon?</i>

180
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,551
<i>Why the kindness, Goldie?</i>

181
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:51,391
<i>The cops, they're telling me too much,
showing up before anybody</i>

182
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,477
<i>but me and the killer could
know there's been a murder.</i>

183
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:58,106
<i>Somebody paid good money
forth is frame.</i>

184
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,901
<i>No reason at all to play it quiet.</i>

185
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:04,154
<i>No reason to play it any way but my way.</i>

186
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,703
Whoever killed you
is gonna pay, Goldie.

187
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,793
Open up, police!

188
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,545
I'll be right out.

189
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,535
<i>I don't know why you died, Goldie.</i>

190
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,668
<i>I don't know why and I don't know how
I never even met you before tonight,</i>

191
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:03,588
<i>but you were a friend and more
when I needed one.</i>

192
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,341
<i>And when I find out who did it,</i>

193
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,386
<i>it won't be quick and quiet
like it was with you.</i>

194
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:13,306
<i>It'll be loud and nasty,
my kind of kill.</i>

195
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,309
<i>And when his eyes go dead,
the hell I send him to</i>

196
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,980
<i>will seem like heaven
after what I've done to him.</i>

197
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,356
<i>I love you, Goldie.</i>

198
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,630
Claire?

199
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:59,019
Now, don't worry, Lucille.
I was just grazed.

200
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:04,232
- You got any beers around this place?
- No way I'm giving you any alcohol.

201
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:08,445
Besides, it's not what
you came here for anyway, is it?

202
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,196
No.

203
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,866
Go ahead.
You're worse without 'em.

204
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,993
Thanks. You're the best.

205
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,871
<i>Lucille's my parole officer.</i>

206
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,123
<i>She's a dyke, but God knows why.</i>

207
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,710
<i>With that body of hers
she could have any man she wants.</i>

208
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,880
<i>The pills come from a girlfriend
who's a shrink.</i>

209
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:31,176
<i>She tried to analyse me once
but she got too scared.</i>

210
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,888
Haven't seen you like this in a while.

211
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,433
- Got in a fight with some cops.
- Didn't happen to kill any of them?

212
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:42,896
Not that I know. But they know they've
been in a fight, that's for damn sure.

213
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,899
How do you suppose
I'm gonna square this with the board?

214
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:51,738
There ain't no squaring it. Not this
time. This isn't some barroom brawl.

215
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,033
Or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone.

216
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,493
Hey, hey. This is big.

217
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:00,330
- Settle down, Marv. Take another pill.
- There ain't no settlin' down!

218
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,666
This is blood for blood,
and by the gallons.

219
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,254
This is the old days and the bad days,
the all-or-nothing days.

220
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,174
They're back.
There's no choices left.

221
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,051
And I'm ready for war.

222
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:17,055
Prison was hell for you.
It's gonna be life this time.

223
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:21,518
Hell's waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you're here.

224
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,395
But I'm out now.

225
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,982
It took somebody who was kind to me
getting killed to do it.

226
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:32,153
But I'm out.
I know exactly what I gotta do.

227
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,952
<i>So you were scared,
weren't you, Goldie?</i>

228
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,663
<i>Somebody wanted you dead
and you knew it.</i>

229
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,499
<i>So you hit the saloons, the bad places,</i>

230
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:48,878
<i>looking for the biggest,
meanest lug around and finding me.</i>

231
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,631
<i>I'm gonna find
that son of a bitch that killed you,</i>

232
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,592
<i>and I'm gonna give him the hard goodbye.</i>

233
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,847
<i>Walk down
the right back alley in Sin City...</i>

234
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,225
- Leave your hands off Nancy.
<i>- ...and you could find anything.</i>

235
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,061
That coat looks like Baghdad.

236
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:08,064
So does your face. Take off!

237
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,489
He's new here, Marv.
He didn't know.

238
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,075
<i>Kadie's is my kind of joint.</i>

239
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,871
<i>Nancy's just getting
started with her gig,</i>

240
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:26,207
<i>but already the crowd's
breathing hard.</i>

241
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,501
<i>Plenty of nights
I've drooled over Nancy,</i>

242
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:32,255
<i>shoulder to shoulder
with all the other losers like me.</i>

243
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,925
<i>But that's not
what I'm lookin' for tonight.</i>

244
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,303
What'll it be, Marv?

245
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:41,264
A shot and a brew, Shellie,
and keep 'em comin'.

246
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:45,101
Sure, honey.
You take it slow, now.

247
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,869
<i>Most people think Marv is crazy.</i>

248
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:06,372
<i>He just had the rotten luck
of being born in the wrong century.</i>

249
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,167
<i>He'd be right at home
on some ancient battlefield,</i>

250
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,628
<i>swinging an axe into somebody's face.</i>

251
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:16,549
<i>Or in a Roman arena taking
a sword to other gladiators like him.</i>

252
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:20,637
<i>They'd have tossed him girls
like Nancy back then.</i>

253
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,184
Show's over, dickwad. Drink up.

254
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,145
That's one fine-looking coat
you're wearing there.

255
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:36,152
Your killin' days are over, you
over-the-hill, do-gooder son of a bitch.

256
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:41,950
<i>I love hit men. No matter what
you do to them, you don't feel bad.</i>

257
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,252
- Take it off.
- What?

258
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,754
A fine coat,
you're bleeding all over it.

259
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,340
All right, it's all yours.
Oh, God!

260
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:01,135
It wasn't you losers who killed Goldie.

261
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:05,682
The guy who did that,
he knew what he was doing.

262
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,018
So tell me, man. Who sent you?

263
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,274
I don't hear you giving me any names.

264
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:18,069
So I guess when I shot you in the belly
I aimed a little too high.

265
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:25,660
You keep holding out on me like this,
and I'm gonna have to get really nasty.

266
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:34,377
It was Telly...
Telly Stern passed me the order.

267
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,298
He runs the tables over
to the Triple Ace Club.

268
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,801
Thanks again.

269
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,975
<i>Then the damnedest thing happens.</i>

270
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:53,313
<i>For a second, I smell the angel smell
that belonged to my Goldie.</i>

271
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,732
<i>Just need my medicine, is all.</i>

272
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,067
Bastard.

273
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,404
You're gonna pay
for what you did to me.

274
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,742
Feel like talking, Louie?

275
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,328
How many got paid off
for the frame, Louie?

276
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:10,163
How many for the kill?

277
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,832
It was Connelly.
He set me up.

278
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,420
He'll never talk.

279
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,593
I don't know about you,
but I'm havin' a ball.

280
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:28,806
<i>Connelly talks. They all talk.</i>

281
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,976
And what have been
your sins, my son?

282
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,645
Well, Padre,
I don't want to keep you up all night,

283
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:37,774
so I'll just fill you in
on the latest batch.

284
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,860
These here hands of mine,
they got blood all over 'em.

285
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,029
You're speaking figuratively.

286
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:47,700
When I need to find something out,
I just go out and look for somebody

287
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,286
that knows more than me,
and I go and I ask them.

288
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,539
Sometimes, I ask pretty hard.

289
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:59,545
By way of a "for instance,"
I killed three men tonight.

290
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,005
Tortured 'em first.

291
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:05,384
You might say I been
working my way up the food chain.

292
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:08,346
First two were minnows,
small-time messengers.

293
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:13,267
But it was Connelly, the money man,
who fingered you, Padre.

294
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:16,020
Dear Lord, man,
this is a house of God.

295
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:19,899
Just give me a damn name.

296
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:23,319
- Roark.
- You really are pushing your luck,

297
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,322
feeding me garbage like that.

298
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,573
It can't be that big.

299
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:29,992
There's a farm
at North Cross and Lennox.

300
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,995
It's all there.
Find out for yourself.

301
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,497
And while you're at it,

302
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:40,503
ask yourself if that corpse of a slut
is worth dying for.

303
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,964
<i>Worth dying for.</i>

304
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,091
<i>Worth killing for.</i>

305
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,510
<i>Worth going to hell for.</i>

306
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,512
Amen.

307
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,893
<i>His keys say the padre drove a Mercedes,</i>

308
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:59,605
<i>or at least that's what they're
passing off as a Mercedes these days.</i>

309
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:03,693
<i>Modern cars:
they all look like electric shavers.</i>

310
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,076
Goldie.

311
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,038
Goldie!

312
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,968
It couldn't be Goldie.

313
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:33,222
<i>It's my own fault, and nobody else's,
that I got confused.</i>

314
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:37,185
<i>I've been having so much fun
I forgot to take my medicine.</i>

315
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:39,187
<i>That wasn't Goldie back there.</i>

316
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,688
<i>Goldie's dead,</i>

317
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:44,734
<i>and that's the whole reason that
I've been doing what I've been doing.</i>

318
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,613
<i>When you got a condition,
it's bad to forget your medicine.</i>

319
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,825
<i>The cold thing,</i>

320
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:56,746
<i>it creeps into my gut and tells me
one more time it won't let go.</i>

321
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:00,416
<i>This is a bad place, this farm.</i>

322
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,084
<i>People have died here...</i>

323
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,463
<i>...the wrong way.</i>

324
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,426
I don't want to fight, pooch.

325
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,015
I got no gripe with you.

326
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,602
Easy, boy.

327
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:26,359
<i>No way I was gonna use
my gun on you, buddy.</i>

328
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,153
<i>It's whoever owns you
I'm curious about,</i>

329
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:33,032
<i>because there's blood on your breath,
and I think I know what kind.</i>

330
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,868
<i>So I sniff around to see what's buried.</i>

331
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,249
<i>Here we go.</i>

332
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:49,882
<i>It's impossible.
Nobody can sneak up on me.</i>

333
00:25:55,346 --> 00:26:00,559
<i>I go blind.
Not a sound. Nobody's that quiet.</i>

334
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:03,854
<i>Except the one who snuck
into that hotel room two nights ago.</i>

335
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:07,900
It was you, you bastard.
You killed her.

336
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,528
You killed Goldie.

337
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,280
It was...

338
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,408
<i>I blew it, Goldie.</i>

339
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,577
<i>I found your killer,
but he was better than me.</i>

340
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,205
<i>Too quiet, too quick.</i>

341
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:23,749
<i>A killer born.</i>

342
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,335
<i>Why didn't he finish the job?</i>

343
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:43,102
He keeps the heads.
He eats the rest.

344
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:46,522
- Lucille?
- It's not just that wolf of his.

345
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:51,444
The wolf just gets scraps.

346
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,487
Bones.

347
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,906
It's him.

348
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:00,453
He... eats... people.

349
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:04,957
- He cooks them like they were steaks.
- Let's get you warm.

350
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,293
Just like they were steaks.

351
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,712
Now he's got both of us.

352
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,923
It's all right.
Take a nice, slow breath.

353
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,635
Just look at the heads on the wall.

354
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,888
The heads on the wall.

355
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,432
The heads on the wall.

356
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:25,519
Son of a bitch!
He kept smiling that damned smile.

357
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:29,648
He made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers.

358
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,526
- He made me watch!
- Oh, Jesus.

359
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,490
He made me watch!

360
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:47,416
Christ, I could use a cigarette.

361
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:52,004
<i>Dames. Sometimes all they
gotta do is let it out.</i>

362
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:55,299
<i>And a few buckets later,
there's no way you'd know.</i>

363
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:58,135
You've brought us
some big trouble this time, Marv.

364
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:02,890
Whoever's behind this whole thing has
his connections right in the department.

365
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,184
Any leads?

366
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,854
One guy I talked to told me
it was Roark running the show.

367
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:13,901
Whoever it is, he knew I was checking
out that hooker almost before I did.

368
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:17,613
- What hooker?
- The one you've been obsessing over.

369
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,824
The dead one.

370
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,076
Goldie.

371
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,620
I didn't know she was a hooker.

372
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,873
Doesn't make any difference
about anything.

373
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:34,296
- But I didn't know that.
- She was high-class stuff.

374
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,173
Must have shown you quite a time.

375
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:38,426
Quiet. There's a car coming.

376
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,765
Kevin!

377
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:49,728
<i>All I've got is a face... and a name.</i>

378
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,814
I'll see you later, Kevin.

379
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:02,825
Let's go.

380
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,427
They're done checking the house.

381
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,554
They're coming this way.

382
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,724
Bastards. I'll show them.

383
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:35,900
You're not gonna get
either of us killed, Marv.

384
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:38,694
No, don't shoot! Please.

385
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,030
Listen to me.
I'm his parole officer.

386
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,574
He's unconscious and unarmed,

387
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:46,660
so there's no need to kill him.

388
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,127
Captain, the target,
there's no sign of him.

389
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,462
Here's a sign!

390
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:14,939
That there is one
damn fine coat you're wearing.

391
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:26,158
<i>I keep coming back to that cop
I just killed and what he told me.</i>

392
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:29,036
<i>I was pretty steamed about
what he'd done to Lucille,</i>

393
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,664
<i>so I took my time
with that son of a bitch.</i>

394
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:36,001
<i>It wasn't till I showed him all those
pieces of himself that he said it.</i>

395
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:41,757
<i>Just a name:
Patrick Henry Roark, man of the cloth.</i>

396
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,927
<i>Could've become president,
but he chose to serve God.</i>

397
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:49,515
<i>Along the way, he happened to become
the most powerful man in the state.</i>

398
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:53,435
<i>He's brought down mayors and governors
like they were nothing.</i>

399
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,189
<i>He even made his rotten brother
a US senator without breaking a sweat.</i>

400
00:30:57,273 --> 00:31:01,151
<i>And here he's gonna get killed
in the name of a dead hooker.</i>

401
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:07,408
<i>I'm getting used to the idea. More
and more, I'm liking the sound of it.</i>

402
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:12,579
<i>Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts.</i>

403
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,540
<i>What if I'm wrong?</i>

404
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,375
<i>I've got a condition.</i>

405
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,711
<i>I get confused sometimes.</i>

406
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:22,631
<i>And with Lucille dead,
I can't get my medicine.</i>

407
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,967
<i>What if I've imagined all of this?</i>

408
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:30,347
<i>What if I've turned into what they've
always said I was gonna turn into?</i>

409
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:32,808
<i>A maniac.</i>

410
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,227
<i>A psycho killer.</i>

411
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:38,480
<i>Can't kill a man
without knowing for sure you ought to.</i>

412
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,607
<i>I've gotta know for sure.</i>

413
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:48,157
<i>The merchandise is on display
by the time I make my way to Old Town.</i>

414
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,951
<i>For an hour or so,
I ask around about Goldie.</i>

415
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:53,829
<i>I don't get any answers,
but I know I'm bound to.</i>

416
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,040
<i>Lucille said Goldie was a hooker,</i>

417
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,917
<i>and if she was, she has roots here:</i>

418
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,795
<i>Friends, maybe even family.</i>

419
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:09,595
You can't be Goldie.
Goldie's dead.

420
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,984
Goldie. Yeah, sure, right.

421
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:28,113
I haven't eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now.

422
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,783
No wonder I'm seeing things.

423
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,326
Bastard!

424
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,958
He's crazy.

425
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:43,087
Hit him again, Wendy. Harder.

426
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,132
Wait a minute.
Why did she call you Wendy?

427
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:49,551
Because that's my name, you ape.

428
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:54,515
Goldie was my sister.
My twin sister.

429
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,975
I guess she was the nice one.

430
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,819
Goldie and the other six,
where are they?

431
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,987
What did you do to them?

432
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,490
You crazy goddamn broad.

433
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,492
Just take a look at this mug.

434
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:17,788
Would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you?

435
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:21,500
None of you would, but Goldie.

436
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,795
And she only did because
she thought I could protect her.

437
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:30,092
And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn
thing about those other girls, did they?

438
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:35,180
But as soon as they had me for a fall
guy, they showed up, guns blazing.

439
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:40,769
But they didn't get me, and I've been
killing my way to the truth ever since.

440
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:44,523
So, go ahead, doll.

441
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:49,236
Shoot me now,
or get the hell out of my way.

442
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,203
Nuts.

443
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:01,790
OK, I'm glad we got
all that sorted out.

444
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:05,961
- What the hell?
- I tied those knots!

445
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,631
- That's my specialty!
- You sat there and took it,

446
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,885
when you could've taken my gun away
any time you wanted to.

447
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:17,347
Well, sure. I thought I might be able
to talk some sense into you.

448
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:20,809
And I probably would have had
to paste you one,

449
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,811
and I don't hurt girls.

450
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:25,230
I need a pair of handcuffs.

451
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:28,400
What style do you want?
I got a collection.

452
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:32,362
Just give him the ones
you got with you, Gail.

453
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:35,407
It was a farm boy named Kevin
who killed Goldie,

454
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:38,827
but it was Cardinal Roark
who was behind it, and I don't know why.

455
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,371
I know that sounds crazy.

456
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:44,750
No, it doesn't.
Goldie worked the clergy.

457
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:49,087
<i>Just like that, a whopper of
a puzzle piece falls smack in my lap.</i>

458
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,840
<i>I'm too dumb to put
the whole picture together yet,</i>

459
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:55,219
<i>but she fires up two cigarettes
and hands me one,</i>

460
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,887
<i>and I taste her lipstick on it.</i>

461
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:01,600
<i>And suddenly, my heart's pounding
so loud I can't hear anything else.</i>

462
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:06,271
<i>I want to reach over and touch her
and taste Goldie's sweat one more time.</i>

463
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,482
<i>But she isn't Goldie.</i>

464
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,567
Yeah, yeah. This'll do.

465
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:16,156
I'm gonna be needing a dozen two-foot
lengths of this rubber tubing...

466
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:19,618
...and a spool of razor wire...

467
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:24,790
...and a pair of those special gloves
that'll let me handle the wire.

468
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,960
Beefing up
the old home security, huh?

469
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,461
You can bet your ass.

470
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:33,799
She was my sister,
so I'm in this one to the end.

471
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:37,553
Why are you willing to go up against
Roark for someone you barely knew?

472
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:42,724
She was nice to me, gave me
something I didn't even know existed.

473
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:47,354
I wasn't never even able to buy a woman.

474
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:50,232
You know, the way I look.

475
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:54,820
<i>I take my mind off her
and I crawl back inside myself.</i>

476
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,864
<i>It's almost killing time,
and I'd better get sharp.</i>

477
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:02,160
<i>I check the list:
rubber tubing, gas, saw,</i>

478
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:06,290
<i>gloves, cuffs, razor wire, hatchet,</i>

479
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,625
<i>Gladys and my mitts.</i>

480
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:12,629
- We're close enough. Pull over.
- Yes, Marv.

481
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,299
Keep the engine runnin'.

482
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:20,137
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you get
the hell outta here and don't look back.

483
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,139
Kill him for me, Marv.

484
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,310
Kill him good.

485
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,145
I won't let you down, Goldie.

486
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,246
<i>Heading downstairs to the kitchen.</i>

487
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:50,959
<i>Getting himself a midnight snack,
and I can guess what kind.</i>

488
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,601
Come on, you son of a bitch.

489
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,437
Damn, he's slick.

490
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,951
Is that the best you can do, creep?

491
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:30,707
<i>That's right.
Get personal, get close. I can take it.</i>

492
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:36,046
I got you, you little bastard.
Let's see you hop around now.

493
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:44,930
<i>I try to slow my heart down
and breathe the fire out of my lungs.</i>

494
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:48,600
<i>My muscles make me
a thousand promises of pain to come.</i>

495
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,521
Let me do it, Marv.
She was my sister. Let me finish him.

496
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,148
You wasn't supposed
to come down here, Wendy.

497
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:57,943
Oh, but I want to...

498
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:02,280
<i>I'm sorry, kid, but I haven't
even started with this creep,</i>

499
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:06,451
<i>and I don't want you watching the rest.
It'll give you nightmares.</i>

500
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:09,663
God, I gotta tell you,
I'm good and bushed.

501
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,791
And it's not that fight of ours
that did me in, either.

502
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,794
It's all that sawing and tying.

503
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,131
It's not as easy as it looks.

504
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,299
Could have been a real mess around here

505
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:24,636
if I didn't have that tubing
for tourniquets.

506
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:31,101
I gotta admit,
there was a spurt or two,

507
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:36,440
to get the scent in the air, to get
that friend of yours to come running.

508
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:41,862
Well, what do you know?

509
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,282
Look who's here.

510
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:46,867
Here he comes.

511
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,293
That's a good dog.

512
00:38:56,376 --> 00:39:00,464
<i>He doesn't scream,
not even when the mutt's had its fill</i>

513
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:03,133
<i>and Kevin's guts
are lying all over the place.</i>

514
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:07,262
<i>Somehow the bastard is still alive,
still staring at me.</i>

515
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:11,266
<i>Not even when I grab the saw
and finish the job.</i>

516
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,436
<i>He never screams.</i>

517
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:20,525
<i>I put in a call to Kadie's
and ask Nancy to get her clothes on</i>

518
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:24,029
<i>and meet me at her place.
She says, "Yes," like always.</i>

519
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,656
Hey, Nancy, you got any beers?

520
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,701
Sure, Marv. Who's the babe?

521
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,662
<i>There isn't much of anything
Nancy wouldn't do for me.</i>

522
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,457
<i>Not since a year back
when a frat boy roughed her up</i>

523
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,876
<i>and I straightened him out but good.</i>

524
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,630
<i>It really gets my go at
when guys rough up dames.</i>

525
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,465
What do you want me to do with her?

526
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:48,178
Well, your best bet is
drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks.

527
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:51,348
What about you?
Are you leaving town?

528
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:54,184
Hell, no. I like it here.

529
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,981
<i>I hot-wire a parked cab
and stay under the speed limit</i>

530
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,317
<i>so as not to get any attention.</i>

531
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,655
<i>My head starts to clear.
Things start to make sense.</i>

532
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,615
<i>I owe you, Goldie.</i>

533
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:11,076
<i>I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up.</i>

534
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,162
<i>So, if going after Roark
means dying, win or lose,</i>

535
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:18,750
<i>hell, I'll die laughing if I know
I've done this one thing right.</i>

536
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,966
Quiet as a grave out here.
No sign of target.

537
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,509
<i>All right, keep a lookout.</i>

538
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:47,988
- Kevin?
- What's left of him, anyways.

539
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:51,283
The dog ate the rest.

540
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:03,211
Oh, my God. You monster.

541
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:06,047
You demon.

542
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,591
Don't scream or I'll plug you.

543
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:12,304
He had the voice of an angel,

544
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,806
yet he spoke only to me.

545
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,810
And he's dead now
because of one stupid whore.

546
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,855
It's not a real good idea
for you to talk about Goldie

547
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,607
that way while I'm around.

548
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,943
When he came to me...

549
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,739
...he was a tormented boy.

550
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:35,327
Tormented by guilt.

551
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,621
I tried to counsel him.

552
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:44,502
But the eating,
it filled him with white light.

553
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:49,716
Tearful, he swore to me
that he felt the touch of God Almighty.

554
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,677
What the hell do you know?

555
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:55,305
I know it's pretty
damn weird to eat people.

556
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:58,183
He didn't just eat their bodies,

557
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,019
he ate their souls.

558
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,898
And I joined in.

559
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,445
They were all whores.

560
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:15,200
Nobody cared for them.
Nobody missed them.

561
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:20,872
And then your... Goldie
almost ruined everything.

562
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,124
<i>She stayed in public places.</i>

563
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,668
<i>And then with you.</i>

564
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:27,003
<i>You were so convenient.</i>

565
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:30,382
<i>You'd broke a man's jaw that very night.</i>

566
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:33,009
Who would believe a thug like you?

567
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:34,677
<i>Kevin killed her.</i>

568
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:38,473
<i>I ordered the police in for you,
but you wouldn't be caught.</i>

569
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,016
<i>You wouldn't stop.</i>

570
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,144
And now he's dead and you're here to...

571
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,481
...eliminate me.

572
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:50,819
Will that give you satisfaction, my son?

573
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:57,659
Killing a helpless old fart?

574
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,412
The killing, no.

575
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,163
No satisfaction.

576
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,169
Everything up until
the killing will be a gas.

577
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,091
Kevin...

578
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,971
...we're going home.

579
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:23,977
You can scream now if you want to.

580
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:36,281
<i>It's beautiful, Goldie.
It's just like I promised, only better.</i>

581
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:39,367
<i>And when his eyes go dead,
the hell I sent him to</i>

582
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:42,203
<i>must seem like heaven
after what I've done to him.</i>

583
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:45,248
- Freeze!
- Oh, my God!

584
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,799
<i>Jerks.</i>

585
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:58,470
<i>They should've shot me in the head,
and enough times to make sure.</i>

586
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,472
<i>It's so stupid.</i>

587
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:04,517
<i>Everybody knows what's coming,
but they go through the motions anyway.</i>

588
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:06,644
<i>What a waste of time.</i>

589
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:11,316
<i>Months fall off the calendar
while I breathe and eat through tubes.</i>

590
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:15,278
<i>Night after night, I wait for somebody
to come and finish me off.</i>

591
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:19,073
<i>After a while, I realise
it's not gonna be so easy as that.</i>

592
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,743
<i>I'm on my feet for ten minutes</i>

593
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:24,829
<i>before the cops kick them out
from under me.</i>

594
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:26,915
<i>They don't ask me any questions.</i>

595
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:31,461
<i>They just keep knocking the crap out of
me and waving a confession in my face.</i>

596
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,546
<i>And I keep spitting blood all over it</i>

597
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:37,133
<i>and laughing at how many fresh copies
they come up with.</i>

598
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:40,512
<i>Then along comes this worm
assistant district attorney</i>

599
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:44,349
<i>who turns the recorder off and says
if I don't sign their confession,</i>

600
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:46,184
<i>they'll kill my mom.</i>

601
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:49,812
<i>I break his arm in three places
and I sign it.</i>

602
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,857
<i>From then on, it's the circus
everybody wants it to be.</i>

603
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:57,362
<i>They nail me for the works,
not just the people I did kill,</i>

604
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:01,866
<i>but even Lucille and the girls
that Roark and Kevin ate,</i>

605
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,202
<i>and even Goldie.</i>

606
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:09,499
<i>The judge is all fire and brimstone
when she hands down the sentence.</i>

607
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:13,670
<i>Midnight and my death
are only a few hours away,</i>

608
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,756
<i>when I get my first surprise
in 18 months.</i>

609
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:20,885
<i>My only visitor.</i>

610
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:23,846
<i>I'm ready for anything but that scent.</i>

611
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,183
I got 'em for you good,
didn't I, Goldie?

612
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:34,816
Oh, I'm sorry, Wendy.

613
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:38,236
I... I got confused again.

614
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,989
Just seeing you like this.

615
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:45,743
You can call me Goldie.

616
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:57,839
<i>She smells like angels ought to smell.</i>

617
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,675
<i>The perfect woman.</i>

618
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,552
<i>The goddess.</i>

619
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:06,055
<i>Goldie.</i>

620
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:08,725
<i>She says her name is Goldie.</i>

621
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:14,897
<i>They fix me a pretty decent steak
for my last meal.</i>

622
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:19,444
<i>They even throw in a brew. It's the
first I've had since back at Nancy's.</i>

623
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:24,240
<i>Then they shave my head and fix me
with a rubber diaper and get to it.</i>

624
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:27,118
<i>And it's about damned time,
if you ask me.</i>

625
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,912
"Though I walk through
the valley of the shadow..."

626
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:32,623
Would you get a move on?
I haven't got all night.

627
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,335
You heard the man. Hit it.

628
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,638
Is that the best you can do,
you pansies?

629
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,986
He's gone.

630
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:24,300
Forget it, man. You can bang
on that door all night if you want to.

631
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:26,928
There is no way in hell
I'm letting you in.

632
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:30,431
I can't believe
you're doing this to me, Shellie.

633
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:34,852
Everything we've shared...
It has to mean something to you.

634
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:38,564
It meant plenty. Plenty of lost pay
on account of how nobody wants

635
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:42,693
to flirt with a waitress whose face is
all purple and swollen up with bruises.

636
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,362
I know you're angry, baby.

637
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,948
I forgive you for that
without you asking me to.

638
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:51,202
There's a difference between getting
honked off at a guy who's not so bad,

639
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:55,248
and finding out that you've been
sweet-talked by a total jerk loser

640
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:58,209
who skips out on a wife
he doesn't even tell you about

641
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:01,087
every time he gets drunk,
which is way too often!

642
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,923
Especially the kind of total jerk loser

643
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:07,093
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man.

644
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,387
That hurt, Shellie.

645
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,682
It's one thing for you
to play hard to get,

646
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,059
but don't go trying to cut my nuts off.

647
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:17,687
I am impossible to get.

648
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,857
Do yourself a favour, Jackie Boy,
and get help,

649
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,110
like... a shrink.

650
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:27,572
Get help and get lost.

651
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:28,906
Just open the door.

652
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:33,870
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie.
I'll take care of this.

653
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:38,040
Just open the door and you'll see
how wrong you've been about me.

654
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:43,045
Oblige him, Shellie.
I'm ready for him.

655
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:45,423
No! If he knew
that you were here with me,

656
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:50,178
- you don't know how bad this could get!
- This clown's got a big, mean drunk on.

657
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,555
He's got four friends
out there in the hall,

658
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,266
breathing hard
and just as drunk as he is.

659
00:48:55,349 --> 00:49:00,396
Hey, I could swear I heard somebody
in there with you just now.

660
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,943
Somebody! Jackie Boy, it's a
regular African love fest in here!

661
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:09,614
- I'm no racist.
- I mean, I got me all five starters,

662
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:12,867
half the bench of the Basin City Blues
keeping me company.

663
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,077
You feel like taking them on?

664
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:18,122
You are teasing me, baby.

665
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:21,876
Some of my best friends...

666
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,212
But you're really pushing my buttons.

667
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,881
And the whole time
you've been doing me like this,

668
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,926
I've been too polite to point out
that any time I want to,

669
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:33,054
I could kick this
damn door to splinters.

670
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,223
OK, baby, you know what I can do.

671
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:38,392
- You know what I can do. One, two...
- All right, then!

672
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:41,521
All right. All right, all right!

673
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:47,652
Troops, make yourself at home.

674
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:59,080
You brought your whole pack with you?

675
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:02,291
None of these bozos got lives,
they gotta hang out with you?

676
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,960
You're gonna love this, baby.

677
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:06,921
Call up some of your friends
who work the saloon.

678
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,424
With you and the bunch of us,
we're gonna hit every joint in town,

679
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:14,512
- and it's gonna be great.
- I ain't calling up nobody.

680
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:23,896
That's a man's shirt, and I'm
sure as hell it ain't one of mine.

681
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:28,276
You got somebody's
love stink all over you.

682
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,696
You've been with another man
and you've been with him tonight.

683
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:35,283
- Who is he?
- He's Superman.

684
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:39,412
He flew out the window just
as soon as he heard you were coming,

685
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:41,956
'cause you scared him so bad.

686
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:48,087
You think I have no feelings at all.

687
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,298
If you're gonna slug me,

688
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:53,426
just go ahead and get it over with,
you sick bastard.

689
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:57,597
There you go, lying about me again,

690
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,433
right in front of my friends.

691
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:03,811
I have never hit a woman in my life.

692
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:11,569
That's showing her, man.

693
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:16,115
You goddamn bastard.
You goddamn coward.

694
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:19,243
- Baby, we're here to have a good time.
- Yeah.

695
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:20,494
I gotta take a leak.

696
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,541
Wish you'd dropped by earlier,
Jackie Boy.

697
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:29,337
Then you could've met my boyfriend.

698
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,922
Could've seen
what a real man looks like.

699
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:35,801
There you go, after my nuts again.

700
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:38,137
But I forgive you.

701
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,264
I'm a generous guy.

702
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:44,810
He is generous.
But that temper of his...

703
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:48,230
You never should have
picked on him like you did.

704
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:51,442
My temper you don't
have to worry about.

705
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:55,738
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself
or I'll cut your little pecker off.

706
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,532
I've been told.

707
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:05,498
Hey, baby,
I don't hear you making those calls.

708
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:08,459
Answer me!

709
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,503
Oh, I don't need this grief.

710
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:15,216
Hi. I'm Shellie's new boyfriend
and I'm out of my mind.

711
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:21,514
You ever so much as talk to Shellie
again, you even think her name,

712
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:25,226
and I'll cut you in ways
that'll make you useless to a woman.

713
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:29,772
You're making a big mistake, man.
A big mistake.

714
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:35,194
Yeah? You already made
a big mistake yourself.

715
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,530
You didn't flush.

716
00:52:37,530 --> 00:53:07,530

717
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:32,793
Troops, get outta here.

718
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:36,922
No questions, damn it.
No questions. Now!

719
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:57,610
Dwight, what in the devil did you do?

720
00:53:57,693 --> 00:54:00,571
I just gave him a taste
of his own medicine.

721
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,948
I don't think he'll
be bothering you again.

722
00:54:03,032 --> 00:54:06,952
- How's your jaw?
- I've been slapped around worse.

723
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:10,956
Dwight, he was from a while back,

724
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,418
before you showed up again
with that new face of yours.

725
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:18,255
And it was only
'cause I felt sorry for him.

726
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:20,716
And it was only once.

727
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,676
I've done some dumb things.

728
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,887
Seeing how
I'm one of those dumb things,

729
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,640
I can't give you
too hard a time about that.

730
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:31,977
But this guy, he's a menace.

731
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:34,897
He might kill somebody
if I don't stop him.

732
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,610
- I'll call you later.
- No, don't go!

733
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,488
<i>Shellie shouts something
I can't quite make out</i>

734
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:45,157
<i>over the racket
of a passing police 'copter.</i>

735
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:47,409
- Stop!
<i>- It sounds like "stop,"</i>

736
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:51,163
<i>but I can't be sure.
It's a chance I shouldn't be taking,</i>

737
00:54:51,247 --> 00:54:53,249
<i>but I can't go home
and forget about it,</i>

738
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:56,669
<i>and let Jackie Boy and his pals
find their fun.</i>

739
00:54:56,752 --> 00:55:02,341
<i>They're a pack of predators and they're
out for blood tonight: a woman's blood.</i>

740
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:05,844
Damn it, Dwight. Damn it.

741
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:08,847
You fool.

742
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,100
You damned fool.

743
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,018
<i>I cut my Caddy across the park</i>

744
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:16,689
<i>to pick up Jackie Boy heading
like a bat outta hell up the hill.</i>

745
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:21,360
<i>I'm speeding. That's a good way
to get yourself noticed.</i>

746
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:25,072
<i>If you're a murderer with a new face
who's one fingerprint check away</i>

747
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,033
<i>from the fast track
to the gas chamber like I am,</i>

748
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:31,036
<i>the last thing you want
is to get noticed.</i>

749
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:37,042
<i>I don't have nearly enough cash on me
to bribe this cop, and even if I did,</i>

750
00:55:37,126 --> 00:55:40,212
<i>there's the outside chance
he's one of the honest ones.</i>

751
00:55:40,296 --> 00:55:46,218
<i>Do I try to talk my way out of this, or
do I take this cop down and risk it all?</i>

752
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:50,222
<i>Then Jackie Boy saves me
a great, big, steaming pile of trouble.</i>

753
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:52,057
Watch it, Jack!

754
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:00,899
Cops! They're right on our ass!

755
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:04,320
Not for long.
Not where we're headed.

756
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:07,448
<i>My gut tightens up.</i>

757
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:11,910
<i>Jackie Boy's leading us
straight to Old Town.</i>

758
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:16,290
<i>The cop shuts off his siren.</i>

759
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,627
<i>He knows he's not the law,
not in Old Town.</i>

760
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:23,922
<i>The ladies are the la where,
beautiful and merciless.</i>

761
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:26,133
<i>If you've got cash
and play by the rules,</i>

762
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:29,845
<i>they'll make all your dreams come true.
But if you cross 'em,</i>

763
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,348
<i>you're a corpse.</i>

764
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:43,067
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

765
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:48,113
Hop in, sugar.
We'll get you there.

766
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:53,035
Sweetheart, I work the day shift
and it's been a long day.

767
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,163
Besides, I don't do group jobs.

768
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:00,250
Get in the car, baby.
We'll just talk. It'll be nice.

769
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,461
I don't do talk jobs, either.

770
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:07,633
Baby doll,
I've had me one hell of a bad day.

771
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:11,387
I've been beat up
every time I turn around.

772
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:13,597
But the day I get
turned down by a hooker

773
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:17,142
when I got good,
hard-earned cash to pay her with,

774
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:19,728
well,

775
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:22,314
there's only so much a man can take.

776
00:57:22,398 --> 00:57:24,525
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street.

777
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,985
That's the Alamo, not the Amigo.

778
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:29,571
The Amigo's a fag joint.

779
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:33,617
Are you having a good time
humiliating me like this

780
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:36,161
for no damn reason at all?

781
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:41,709
That's far enough, Dwight.
We've been on top of these peckerwoods

782
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,336
since they showed up
with that cop behind them.

783
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,463
Everything's under control.

784
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,633
Enjoy the show.

785
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:52,678
<i>There's no use arguing with her.</i>

786
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:55,639
<i>The ladies are their own enforcers.</i>

787
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:58,726
How's the barmaid?
You know, the one that never shuts up?

788
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,394
Not right now, Gail.

789
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:04,189
Wound up a little tight, aren't we?

790
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:08,026
That's your whole problem, Dwight.
You worry too much.

791
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:11,155
That, and your lousy taste in women.
These days, anyway.

792
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:14,116
Damn it, Gail. Not right now.

793
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:18,203
Those clowns down the way,
they some of the barmaid's boyfriends?

794
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:20,372
One of them thinks he is.

795
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:22,499
He's outta control.

796
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:26,003
I followed them here to make sure
he didn't hurt any of the girls.

797
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:29,715
Us helpless little girls.

798
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:34,386
<i>All kinds of death is about to hit
less than 20 yards ahead of us,</i>

799
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:38,015
<i>and still it's hard
to take my eyes off her.</i>

800
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:40,684
Us girls are safe
as we can be, Lancelot.

801
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:43,353
Those boys in that Chrysler
are one mistake away

802
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,898
from seeing what Miho can do.

803
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:49,818
And she's been aching
for some practice.

804
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:55,699
<i>She guides my glance upwards
to the pixie perched on the roof's edge.</i>

805
00:58:55,783 --> 00:58:59,828
<i>- Deadly little Miho.</i>
- You're running out of alley, cowboy.

806
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:04,416
Turn around. Save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief.

807
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,919
You're a sassy little thing.

808
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:12,049
You ain't hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats.

809
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:16,178
<i>The trap is set,
locked and ready to spring.</i>

810
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:19,890
<i>So what? They're scum.
They deserve what's coming.</i>

811
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:23,602
<i>So why this rotten feeling in my gut
that something is awfully wrong?</i>

812
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,897
They haven't killed anybody
I know about.

813
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,652
It got pretty bad at Shellie's place,
but they didn't kill anybody.

814
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,153
And they won't.

815
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:35,364
<i>Why this rotten feeling?</i>

816
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:38,742
<i>Something Shellie said.
I can't place it.</i>

817
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:43,038
OK, OK, OK. I sounded off
a little more than I should have.

818
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:46,124
- I'm a little on edge.
- Over the edge.

819
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:49,419
It's not a woman you need.
It's a good night's sleep.

820
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:53,257
You couldn't handle a woman,
the state you're in.

821
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,843
She's saying you ain't got
what it takes, Jack.

822
00:59:58,554 --> 01:00:00,222
You wanna see it?

823
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,058
You wanna see what I got?

824
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:08,939
I've seen all shapes, all sizes.

825
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,484
You seen this one?

826
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,737
Get in the car.

827
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:20,826
Oh, sugar, you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life.

828
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,303
Oh, God, no!

829
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,056
This is crazy!

830
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:46,476
Out of nowhere, for no reason at all!

831
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,277
Go ahead.

832
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,614
Go ahead. Go ahead.

833
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:01,199
- He's got the drop on her.
- He's got squat.

834
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:05,120
He's dead.
He's just too damn dumb to know it.

835
01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:11,710
I got you right where I want you.

836
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,880
This is a career-ending wound, whore.

837
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:18,592
- And there's gonna be hell to pay.
- Watch your step, Jackie Boy.

838
01:01:30,646 --> 01:01:32,773
This isn't funny.

839
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:37,027
Don't anyone laugh.
I got friends you can't imagine.

840
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,404
Every one of you is gonna burn.

841
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,325
Hang it up.
She's just playing with you.

842
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:46,787
- You're only making it worse.
- You shut the hell up.

843
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:51,208
Don't pull the trigger.
She blocked the barrel. It'll backfire.

844
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:55,087
I told you to shut up.

845
01:02:00,092 --> 01:02:02,386
I can't see.

846
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,346
What's happening?

847
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,433
I can't see.

848
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:11,269
I can't hear anything.

849
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:14,773
For God's sake, Miho, finish him.

850
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:18,443
Yeah. Make it quick, will you?

851
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:23,365
<i>She doesn't quite chop his head off.</i>

852
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:29,246
<i>She makes a Pez dispenser out of him.</i>

853
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:32,666
<i>Then it's straight to business:</i>

854
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:36,628
<i>Stretching corpses out on the floor
and going through their pockets,</i>

855
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:41,341
<i>divvying up cash when they find it. I'm
fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants.</i>

856
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,260
<i>His wallet is packed.</i>

857
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:47,305
<i>Mastercard, Discover,
Platinum American Express,</i>

858
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:49,641
<i>and nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties</i>

859
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:53,645
<i>that I'm not too proud
to stuff into my own pockets.</i>

860
01:02:53,729 --> 01:02:55,397
<i>Then I find an atom bomb.</i>

861
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,360
<i>Jackie Boy,</i>

862
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:02,696
<i>you son of a bitch.</i>

863
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:09,995
<i>There was a helicopter
that kicked up such a racket,</i>

864
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:13,206
<i>I couldn't quite
make out what she said.</i>

865
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,709
<i>I thought Shellie said "stop."</i>

866
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,628
<i>She said "cop."</i>

867
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:21,506
<i>Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty.</i>

868
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:25,093
<i>Iron Jack, the papers call him.</i>

869
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:27,929
<i>A goddamn hero cop.</i>

870
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:34,686
<i>It's held for years, the shaky truce.
The cops get a slice of the profits</i>

871
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:37,314
<i>and free entertainment
when they throw a party.</i>

872
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:40,025
<i>The girls administer
their own brand of justice.</i>

873
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:45,280
<i>They get to defend their own turf.
If a cop blunders into the neighbourhood</i>

874
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:49,743
<i>and he's not shopping for what the girls
are selling, they send him packing,</i>

875
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,496
<i>but they send him back alive.</i>

876
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,706
<i>That's the rules.</i>

877
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,666
<i>That's the truce.</i>

878
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:59,211
<i>The cops stay out.</i>

879
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:02,339
<i>That keeps the girls free
to keep the pimps and the mob out.</i>

880
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:05,675
<i>Old Town will be left wide open.</i>

881
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,636
<i>It'll be war.</i>

882
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:11,223
<i>The streets will run red with blood.</i>

883
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:13,350
<i>Women's blood.</i>

884
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:18,897
The cops! The mob! Things are gonna
go back to the way they used to be!

885
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,818
The hell they will! We got guns.

886
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,986
We'll fight the cops and the mob

887
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:28,156
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us.

888
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,200
- We'll go to war.
- Don't be stupid.

889
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:33,578
You wouldn't stand a chance.
Get me a car.

890
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:36,790
Make sure it's a hardtop
with a decent engine.

891
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,250
I'll hide the bodies.

892
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:41,837
Did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here?

893
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,422
The cops know Rafferty came here.

894
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:47,259
They'll check the river,
they'll check the sewer.

895
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:49,553
They'll find him
and come gunning for us.

896
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,472
I'll haul the bodies to the pits.
The cops won't check.

897
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:54,599
Get that out of my face
or I'll smack ya.

898
01:04:54,683 --> 01:04:58,728
Who do you think you are,
giving orders?

899
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:01,523
- You got what you wanted out of us.
- Shut up, Gail.

900
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:04,317
You got what you wanted out of me!

901
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:07,696
And you were gone,
off playing with that barmaid.

902
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:11,992
Gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us.

903
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,828
<i>Miho moves to my back.</i>

904
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:18,957
<i>One word from Gail
and she'll cut me in half.</i>

905
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,711
They'll be watching the roads.
They'll catch you.

906
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:26,006
It'll be the bad old days
all over again.

907
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,758
The pimps, the beatings,
the drugs, the rapes!

908
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:32,846
They won't be watching the roads. Not
yet, they won't! Get me a damn hardtop!

909
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,181
If I don't make it,
you can have your war.

910
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,893
Get that gun out of my face now!

911
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,314
Bastard!

912
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:49,237
I forgot how quick you are.

913
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:52,908
<i>My warrior woman.</i>

914
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:55,619
<i>She almost yanks my head clean off</i>

915
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:58,997
<i>shoving my mouth into hers
so hard it hurts.</i>

916
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:02,542
<i>An explosion that blasts away
the dull, grey years</i>

917
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:06,922
<i>between the now and that one fiery night
when she was mine.</i>

918
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,592
A hardtop with a decent engine.

919
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,053
And make sure it's got a big trunk.

920
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:18,266
I'll always love you, baby.

921
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:22,228
Always... and never.

922
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,197
Where'd you find that heap?

923
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,909
Just look at that trunk.
We'll never fit 'em all in.

924
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,537
Gail? Unless there's something else
you want me to do,

925
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:41,581
you think maybe I could go home?

926
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:45,835
All this blood and stuff's got me
feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl.

927
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:48,088
Sure, Becky, go home.

928
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:50,966
But don't you talk to anybody,
not even your mom.

929
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:53,927
They'll never fit in that trunk.

930
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,806
Not like this, they won't. Miho.

931
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:00,183
Dry your hair as soon as you get home!

932
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,519
You'll catch cold if you don't.

933
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,700
Hey, Becky. Gail said no calls.

934
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:20,704
I just want to hear my mom's voice.
I won't tell her nothing.

935
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:23,415
Please, don't say nothing to Gail.

936
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:27,502
Hey, Mom?

937
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,883
<i>Dizzy dames. What were they thinking,</i>

938
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:37,095
<i>sticking me with a beat-up bucket
of bolts like this?</i>

939
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,931
<i>We were barely able to get
the trunk closed as it was,</i>

940
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,641
<i>we packed it so tight.</i>

941
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:46,604
<i>There wasn't anything we could do
but pile Jackie Bo yin right next to me,</i>

942
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:50,608
<i>out where anybody
who cares to look will see him.</i>

943
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:55,739
<i>Go ahead, take one of his cigarettes.</i>

944
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:58,575
<i>It'll help.</i>

945
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:27,353
It's got you smoking there, bud.

946
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:35,153
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy.

947
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:37,363
You're dead.

948
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:41,659
I'm just imagining this,
so shut the hell up.

949
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:46,664
Well, it tells you something
about your state of mind, don't it?

950
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:51,211
It's got you hearing things.
It's got your nerves shot.

951
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:54,839
It's got you smoking.

952
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:58,927
You know it's true.

953
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:02,764
Nobody ever really quits.

954
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:09,062
A smoker's a smoker
when the chips are down.

955
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:14,067
- And your chips are down.
- I'm fine. You shut the hell up.

956
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:18,112
Will you look at that?

957
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:23,117
Those hookers let you down.

958
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:29,541
What are you gonna do
when you run outta gas, call AAA?

959
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:33,878
You sucker for the babes, you.

960
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:36,881
You ain't even
gonna make it to the pits.

961
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:40,134
You shut the hell up. I'll make it.

962
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:43,555
Not unless you keep
your eyes on the road, sugar pie.

963
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:45,306
Watch it!

964
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:50,228
This is great.

965
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:53,690
Just like being in a buddy movie.

966
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:56,150
Shut up!

967
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:03,241
Boy, you're screwed.

968
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:05,368
It's over.

969
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,954
You're flushed.

970
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,915
This time, I can't bring myself
to tell him to shut up.

971
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:15,044
Sure, he's an asshole.

972
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:17,755
Sure, he's dead.

973
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:21,426
Sure, I'm just imagining
that he's talking.

974
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:25,597
None of that stops the bastard
from being absolutely right.

975
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:29,100
I don't have a chance in hell
of outrunning this cop.

976
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:31,436
Not in this heap.

977
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:34,022
Pull over!

978
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:38,902
The only question left
is whether I'm gonna kill him or not.

979
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,613
Tough call.

980
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:44,866
For all I know,
he's an honest cop, regular guy,

981
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:49,120
a working stiff with a mortgage,
a wife and a pile of kids.

982
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,497
My hand moves all on its own,

983
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:55,627
sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer.

984
01:10:57,795 --> 01:11:02,800
- I don't know what to do.
- Better stop. You're making him mad.

985
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:07,055
Whatever you say.

986
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:17,732
Your friend here...
party a little too hard tonight?

987
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:22,028
I'm the designated driver.

988
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:30,954
Well, you're driving
with a busted tail light.

989
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,378
I'll let you off with a warning.

990
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,553
What next?

991
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:56,562
<i>The tank goes dry
a quarter mile from the pits.</i>

992
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:59,691
<i>I shove the T-Bird the rest of the way.</i>

993
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:03,069
<i>A few minutes' more work
and it'll all be over.</i>

994
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:06,531
<i>Jackie Boy
will go into the damn tar pits,</i>

995
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:10,827
<i>I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks,
go home and call it a...</i>

996
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:24,382
No more questions, Dallas.
Do what I say.

997
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:28,177
Clear the streets.
We're in lockdown.

998
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,888
We're not selling any tail in Old Town.

999
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:33,349
Not tonight.

1000
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:40,356
Don't struggle.
You'll only hurt yourself.

1001
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,692
Your cause is lost.

1002
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,360
We know everything.

1003
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:48,656
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty
will be in our possession,

1004
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:53,745
and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered.

1005
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:56,956
There'll be arrests.
There'll be deaths.

1006
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:01,085
My employer will seize
what remains of this neighbourhood.

1007
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:05,423
You will all be slaves.
Nothing can stop this.

1008
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:10,553
But it is within your power
to save many lives

1009
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:15,266
by facilitating
the process of transition,

1010
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:20,897
by negotiating the terms
of the surrender of Old Town.

1011
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,566
Son of a bitch! I know you.

1012
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:28,780
I have suffered your kind before,
the dregs of Sin City.

1013
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:30,865
I serve a new master now,

1014
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:35,787
and soon you and all your wretched kind
will serve him as well.

1015
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:41,292
Now, get dressed and shed a tear
for Dwight McCarthy if you must,

1016
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,921
because, by now, he is surely dead.

1017
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:47,757
You don't know him.

1018
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,094
My man will find a way.

1019
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:54,222
He always finds a way.

1020
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:57,725
I can't fathom
these Americans always whining

1021
01:13:57,809 --> 01:14:01,312
and going on about
how they got it so bad.

1022
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:03,648
This is a fine, grand country.

1023
01:14:03,731 --> 01:14:05,983
Guiding light
of the modern world, it is.

1024
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:09,112
Low taxes, land of opportunity.

1025
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:13,116
Where else would one bullet buy us
the fortune that we're getting for this?

1026
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:16,119
Beats the hell
out of blowing up airports and churches

1027
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:18,246
without shite to show for it.

1028
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:28,172
- You find something, Murphy?
- Looks to be a poor, dead cop's badge.

1029
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:30,299
It's all bent up.

1030
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:33,177
What's this stuck in it?

1031
01:14:33,261 --> 01:14:35,263
Bloody hell. It's the bullet.

1032
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:48,234
You son of a bitch! Bastard!

1033
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,863
<i>They weren't cops, these four.</i>

1034
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:53,698
<i>They were mercenaries.</i>

1035
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:56,159
<i>If they were hired
by who I think they were,</i>

1036
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:59,203
<i>the bad times
haven't even started yet.</i>

1037
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:02,665
<i>And everything seemed
to be going so well.</i>

1038
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:20,057
Remember, we don't have to deliver
every last inch of the man, Brian.

1039
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:24,020
You got a good point there, Ronnie.
Lend me your knife.

1040
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:28,900
Should I take a nap
while I'm doing all this waiting?

1041
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:31,903
I'm at the bone, all right?

1042
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,365
There we go.

1043
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:43,331
Have you ever seen anything so pretty
in your whole life?

1044
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:48,044
We'll be back for the three of you,
and if anyone happens by,

1045
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:51,005
use your imagination, OK?

1046
01:16:00,932 --> 01:16:03,267
<i>Silence, now.</i>

1047
01:16:03,351 --> 01:16:05,728
<i>No air to breathe.</i>

1048
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:09,857
<i>Only the horrid, oily tar taste
creeping up my nostrils.</i>

1049
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:15,446
<i>Let it in. Let it fill your lungs.</i>

1050
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:19,200
<i>They were counting on you
and you blew it.</i>

1051
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:24,455
<i>Skinny, steely fingers at my wrist.</i>

1052
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:28,251
<i>Miho, you're an angel.</i>

1053
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,211
<i>You're a saint.</i>

1054
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:32,505
<i>You're Mother Teresa.</i>

1055
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,632
<i>You're Elvis.</i>

1056
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:36,759
<i>You're God.</i>

1057
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:42,974
<i>If you'd shown up ten minutes earlier,
we'd still have Jackie Boy's head.</i>

1058
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:46,727
Dwight, they got Gail!

1059
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,773
It's a cinch.
You got yourselves a spy in Old Town.

1060
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:53,693
A stoolie who sold you out to the mob.

1061
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:56,195
We gotta find out who it is
and rescue Gail.

1062
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:58,322
First, we gotta get
Jackie Boy's head

1063
01:16:58,406 --> 01:17:02,618
before it gets to wherever it's going
and this situation blows wide open.

1064
01:17:02,702 --> 01:17:07,999
Miho, I hope to hell you left
one of 'em alive enough to talk.

1065
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:19,176
<i>I let him know I'm not fooling around.</i>

1066
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:26,017
<i>We talk.</i>

1067
01:17:35,026 --> 01:17:38,821
<i>Stay smart. Stay cool.</i>

1068
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:42,366
<i>It's time to prove to your friends
that you're worth a damn.</i>

1069
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:45,578
<i>Sometimes, that means dying.</i>

1070
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:49,165
<i>Sometimes, it means killing
a whole lot of people.</i>

1071
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:51,625
There they are.
What do we do?

1072
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,961
We stop 'em, Dallas.

1073
01:18:02,303 --> 01:18:04,472
<i>Jackie Boy's head is so close to me</i>

1074
01:18:04,555 --> 01:18:08,392
<i>I could almost reach out
and grab it right then and there.</i>

1075
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:15,733
Get the head! Get the head!

1076
01:18:17,485 --> 01:18:19,403
I got it! I got it!

1077
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,871
Suck on this, you stupid slag!

1078
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:35,753
<i>I can't tell if Miho is alive or dead,</i>

1079
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:40,758
<i>but I'm on my feet and every ounce
of me wants to get some killing done.</i>

1080
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:48,015
You want the head now, sweetheart?
So come down and get it!

1081
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,772
Brave lad.

1082
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:58,943
I could've put a bullet
straight down your ear just now,

1083
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:02,863
if I hadn't got me revolver
all wet and useless.

1084
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:06,826
You got the drop on me, love.
I'm as helpless as a baby.

1085
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:17,628
I got to come clean
with you, sweetheart.

1086
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:22,716
It was an outright lie I was giving ya
about me revolver being wet.

1087
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,428
You see, I'm not
too fond of shootin'.

1088
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:28,597
It's my preference to blow things up.

1089
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,808
Once you blast the roof off a pub

1090
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:34,895
and seen all the parts
flying off people,

1091
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:38,149
a little bang bang's
never gonna match the sight of that.

1092
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:44,488
Here's me, with all these fine grenades
and such a sweet beauty of a remote.

1093
01:19:44,572 --> 01:19:48,117
But it's me knife
I'll be doing you with.

1094
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,786
You killed me mates.

1095
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:55,332
Someone shoulda told ya: never give
an Irishman good cause for revenge.

1096
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:59,462
<i>Deadly little Miho.</i>

1097
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:03,048
<i>You won't feel a thing
unless she wants you to.</i>

1098
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:05,926
<i>She twists the blade.</i>

1099
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:07,761
<i>He feels it.</i>

1100
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:14,351
<i>I tell Miho what we're gonna do
and how we're gonna do it.</i>

1101
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:18,939
<i>I grab poor Dallas's car phone and make
the most important call of my life.</i>

1102
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:23,986
<i>First, we gotta rescue Gail,
then comes the kill.</i>

1103
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:28,032
<i>The big, fat kill.</i>

1104
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:41,212
Do we just gotta stand here
and watch this?

1105
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:43,130
What, are you kidding me, man?

1106
01:20:43,214 --> 01:20:46,884
I could watch old Manute do his thing
all night and not get tired of it.

1107
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,469
I mean, the man's an artist.

1108
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:53,641
Only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject.

1109
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:55,684
Your skin is perfect.

1110
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,896
Your nerves, responsive.

1111
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,314
Beautiful.

1112
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:03,484
Just give them what they want, Gail.

1113
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:10,616
- Becky?
- It's over, Gail.

1114
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:14,995
There's no fighting them.
Dwight's dead.

1115
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:17,331
They got what's left
of that cop we killed.

1116
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:20,501
Mob's gonna turn it over to the chief,
cops'll mow us down.

1117
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:22,419
We gotta cut a deal.

1118
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:26,090
You little bitch! You sold us out!

1119
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:29,176
I didn't have no choice!
They was gonna hurt my mom.

1120
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:33,430
You gotta cut a deal with these people.
It's selfish, you holding out like this.

1121
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:36,350
You'll get a lot of girls killed
for no good reason.

1122
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:38,936
It wasn't your mom!

1123
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:42,147
We could have protected her
and you know it.

1124
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:44,942
It was the money,
you stupid little bitch!

1125
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:48,862
Sure, there's money. Sure, you
could've moved my mom into Old Town

1126
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:51,740
and let her know
that her daughter's a goddamn whore.

1127
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:53,951
Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

1128
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:58,789
They offered me what you couldn't
never offer me: a way out.

1129
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:00,749
I had to watch out for my own neck.

1130
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,459
Your neck.

1131
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:06,839
Your precious, scrawny, little neck!

1132
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:15,014
You're crazy! You could have
ripped my throat out, you crazy whore!

1133
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:20,060
Schutz, fetch my blades.

1134
01:22:20,144 --> 01:22:24,064
- Stuka, kill this one.
- No, I was promised!

1135
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:26,984
Stupid little bitch!
You deserve worse!

1136
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:30,613
I knew there was a reason
I got out of bed this morning.

1137
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,617
Hey.

1138
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:36,827
Hey.

1139
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:39,288
Nobody. I don't see nobody.

1140
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:43,125
Will you look at that?
It's right through me. Guys, look.

1141
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:46,086
There's something wrapped around it.

1142
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:48,839
- Some kind of note.
- Give it to me.

1143
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:53,135
It's poked right through me.
Guys, look.

1144
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:59,183
- Starting to hurt.
- Out back. Everyone. Bring the women.

1145
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:02,436
Do you think somebody
should call me a doctor or something?

1146
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:05,189
McCarthy, you fool.

1147
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:08,108
Hey.

1148
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:10,444
Guys?

1149
01:23:17,076 --> 01:23:21,288
<i>Dozens of them, armed to the teeth.</i>

1150
01:23:21,372 --> 01:23:25,542
<i>I'm outnumbered, outgunned.</i>

1151
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:31,215
<i>But the alley is crooked,
dark and very narrow.</i>

1152
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:33,926
<i>They can't surround me.</i>

1153
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:39,139
<i>Sometimes, you can beat the odds with
the careful choice of where to fight.</i>

1154
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:45,729
You can have Old Town, I don't care.

1155
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:48,690
Just give me the woman.

1156
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:52,736
Shut up.

1157
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:55,572
Dwight, don't do this.

1158
01:23:55,656 --> 01:24:00,285
- Wait a minute. Something's not right.
- Shut up, or I'll plug you!

1159
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:05,499
Of course, Mr McCarthy.
A fair trade. She's all yours.

1160
01:24:14,425 --> 01:24:19,263
Now, if you'll explain to me why we
shouldn't blow both of you to pieces...

1161
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:23,350
Dwight, what have you done?

1162
01:24:23,434 --> 01:24:25,227
Exactly what I had to.

1163
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:29,398
Every step of the way.

1164
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,945
No! It isn't right!
There wasn't no tape over his mouth!

1165
01:24:35,028 --> 01:24:37,197
How come there's tape over his mouth?

1166
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:52,045
<i>Where to fight counts for a lot.</i>

1167
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:56,633
Cute trick, McCarthy,
but it will do you no good.

1168
01:24:56,717 --> 01:25:00,804
<i>But there's nothing like having
your friends show up with lots of guns.</i>

1169
01:25:00,888 --> 01:25:03,765
No! McCarthy, you shit!

1170
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:09,021
<i>The girls all know the score.</i>

1171
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:12,024
<i>No escape,</i>

1172
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:15,777
<i>no surrender, no mercy.</i>

1173
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:20,032
<i>We gotta kill every last
rat bastard one of 'em.</i>

1174
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,326
<i>Every last one.</i>

1175
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:26,622
<i>Not for revenge,
not because they deserve it,</i>

1176
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:29,583
<i>not because it'll make
the world a better place.</i>

1177
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:32,836
<i>We need a heap of bloody bodies</i>

1178
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:36,965
<i>so when mob boss Wallenquist looks over
his charts of profits and losses,</i>

1179
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:41,345
<i>he'll see what it cost him
to mess with the girls of Old Town.</i>

1180
01:25:41,428 --> 01:25:44,640
<i>The Valkyrie at my side
is shouting and laughing</i>

1181
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:50,062
<i>with the pure, hateful,
bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter,</i>

1182
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:52,481
<i>and so am I.</i>

1183
01:25:57,569 --> 01:26:02,074
<i>The fire, baby.
It'll burn us both.</i>

1184
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:06,453
<i>There's no place in this world
for our kind of fire,</i>

1185
01:26:06,537 --> 01:26:10,874
<i>my warrior woman, my Valkyrie.</i>

1186
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:13,877
<i>You'll always be mine.</i>

1187
01:26:13,961 --> 01:26:17,881
<i>Always... and never.</i>

1188
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:34,064
Evenin', officer.

1189
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:37,192
I don't have to introduce myself, do I?

1190
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:39,236
You read the papers.

1191
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:42,781
This being an election year,
you've seen plenty of my picture.

1192
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:45,993
You know who I am and what I can do.

1193
01:26:46,076 --> 01:26:49,204
And I'm doin' you, Hartigan.

1194
01:26:49,288 --> 01:26:51,957
Cold and hard, I'm doing you.

1195
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,334
You blew my son's ear off.

1196
01:26:55,919 --> 01:27:01,049
You blew his arm off. You even
blew his nuts and his pecker off.

1197
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:08,432
He's in a coma right now. They say
he may never come out of it. My boy.

1198
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:11,685
He could've been the first Roark
to become the president

1199
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:15,981
but you went and turned him into
a brain-damaged, dick less freak.

1200
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:19,943
Pullin' that trigger
make you feel powerful?

1201
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:24,906
Power don't come
from a badge or a gun.

1202
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:28,493
Power comes from lying.

1203
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:33,081
Lying big, and gettin' the whole
damn world to play along with you.

1204
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:34,958
Once you got everybody agreeing

1205
01:27:35,042 --> 01:27:39,171
with what they know in their hearts
ain't true, you've got 'em by the balls.

1206
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:44,760
There's what,
maybe 500 people in this hospital?

1207
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:50,932
I could pump you full of bullets right
now, and I wouldn't even be arrested.

1208
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:54,269
Everyone would lie for me,
everyone who counts.

1209
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:57,272
Otherwise, their lies,
everything that runs Sin City,

1210
01:27:57,356 --> 01:28:01,401
it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards.

1211
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:08,283
But I want you firm
and fit and healthy.

1212
01:28:08,367 --> 01:28:11,411
I'm even putting up cash of my own
to get you more surgery.

1213
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:14,748
Fix that heart condition of yours.

1214
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:20,170
You're gonna keep on living a long time.
I'm gonna make sure of that.

1215
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:26,593
You're gonna be convicted of raping
that little brat, and shooting my boy.

1216
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:29,346
You're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison,

1217
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:33,266
disgraced, destroyed...

1218
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:35,394
...alone.

1219
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,230
Your wife?

1220
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,565
You tell her the truth and she's dead.

1221
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:43,777
You tell anybody the truth
and they're dead.

1222
01:28:45,612 --> 01:28:47,406
They won't let me testify.

1223
01:28:47,489 --> 01:28:51,827
I told the cops that you saved my life
and they just acted like I was crazy.

1224
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:54,413
They talked my parents
into keeping me away.

1225
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:57,249
They said that you'd done things
that you didn't do.

1226
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:59,960
I told them you saved me
from that Roark creep,

1227
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:04,214
but they won't even check me out
to see that I'm still a virgin.

1228
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:08,718
I'm still a virgin, still alive,
thanks to you.

1229
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:11,263
They got it all backwards.

1230
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:14,099
Sometimes, the truth
doesn't matter like it ought.

1231
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:18,645
But you'll always remember things right.

1232
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:20,856
That's gonna mean a lot to me.

1233
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:27,362
But stay away, Nancy.
They'll kill you if you don't stay away.

1234
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:29,448
Don't visit me.

1235
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:31,366
Don't write me.

1236
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:33,535
Don't even say my name.

1237
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:38,165
Maybe you won't let me visit,
but I'll still write to you, Hartigan.

1238
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:40,125
I'll sign my letters "Cordelia."

1239
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:44,838
That's the name of a really cool
detective in books I read.

1240
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:49,259
I'll write you every week...
for forever.

1241
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:52,179
Sure, kid.

1242
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:54,389
Now, run on home.

1243
01:29:54,473 --> 01:29:56,808
It's not safe for you here.

1244
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:02,022
Bye, Nancy.

1245
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:08,236
I love you.

1246
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:18,622
John Hartigan.

1247
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:21,500
Mr Law and Order.

1248
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:26,004
Mr By the Book.

1249
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:28,256
Mr High and Mighty.

1250
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:34,054
I gotta give you credit, being a
straight arrow for so damn many years

1251
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:36,139
without it catching up with you.

1252
01:30:36,223 --> 01:30:39,643
It's catching up with you now,
friend of mine.

1253
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:41,853
It's catching up with you but good.

1254
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:48,693
Maybe I oughta look at him.
He doesn't look good.

1255
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:52,781
He's hale and hearty, Tammy.

1256
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:55,325
See?

1257
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:56,868
He's the picture of health.

1258
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:02,290
That Tammy, there,
she's fine, isn't she?

1259
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:04,501
I rented her out of Old Town.

1260
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:09,381
I wanted to show you what you won't
be getting any of, not in prison.

1261
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:10,799
You hear me, Hartigan?

1262
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:14,553
If you stop being stupid,
start playing along with us,

1263
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:17,389
you might just get some of Tammy.

1264
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:21,268
You see that? She flinched.

1265
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:23,687
You make her sick.

1266
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:26,565
She heard about you
and that little girl.

1267
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:30,944
<i>This is nothing but a price I promised
myself I'd pay, and I'm paying it.</i>

1268
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:32,904
<i>You don't save a little girl's life,</i>

1269
01:31:32,988 --> 01:31:35,490
<i>then turn around
and throw her to the dogs.</i>

1270
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:37,576
<i>Not in my book, you don't.</i>

1271
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:40,954
<i>They want a confession.
They won't get it.</i>

1272
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:47,919
<i>There's a letter from Nancy waiting
when they put me in solitary.</i>

1273
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:51,089
<i>She calls herself "Cordelia,"
just like she promised.</i>

1274
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:54,884
<i>She makes no mention of anything
that would give her away.</i>

1275
01:31:54,968 --> 01:31:58,179
<i>At first, I figure
she'll send another note or two</i>

1276
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:01,558
<i>before her young mind
moves on to better things.</i>

1277
01:32:01,641 --> 01:32:04,686
<i>But every Thursday,
another one arrives.</i>

1278
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:06,563
<i>What a sweet kid.</i>

1279
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:11,234
<i>I do my best to keep my hand
from shaking when I reach for it.</i>

1280
01:32:11,318 --> 01:32:15,780
<i>She's the only friend I've got,
the daughter I never had.</i>

1281
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:17,824
<i>My sweet Cordelia.</i>

1282
01:32:17,907 --> 01:32:20,285
<i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan.</i>

1283
01:32:22,329 --> 01:32:24,623
<i>Eight years pass.</i>

1284
01:32:29,002 --> 01:32:32,047
<i>Then comes a Thursday
when I bound from my cot,</i>

1285
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:34,132
<i>excited as a kid at Christmas,</i>

1286
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:37,802
<i>only to find myself staring
at the damn floor of my damn cell,</i>

1287
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:41,056
<i>looking for a letter from Nancy
that isn't there.</i>

1288
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:44,100
<i>Then another Thursday with no letter.</i>

1289
01:32:44,184 --> 01:32:46,019
<i>Is she all right?</i>

1290
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:48,480
<i>Did something happen to her?</i>

1291
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:51,107
<i>Nothing.</i>

1292
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:54,861
<i>Two months now.
Not a word from Nancy.</i>

1293
01:32:54,944 --> 01:32:58,323
<i>Did they find her?
Did they get to her?</i>

1294
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:01,993
<i>Of course! Stupid old man.</i>

1295
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:05,664
<i>Do your math.
Nancy's 19 years old.</i>

1296
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:08,249
<i>How long did you expect her
to keep writing?</i>

1297
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:12,003
<i>She was a saint to keep it up
as long as she did.</i>

1298
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:15,173
<i>She's forgotten you, old man.</i>

1299
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:17,217
<i>You're alone.</i>

1300
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,636
<i>You're all alone.</i>

1301
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:31,147
<i>This guy smells awful, like bad food.</i>

1302
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:34,609
<i>Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster
in the middle of summer.</i>

1303
01:33:34,693 --> 01:33:36,778
<i>He stinks so bad, I want to throw up.</i>

1304
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:50,667
<i>Practically knocked my head off
the bastard.</i>

1305
01:33:51,418 --> 01:33:53,712
<i>When I come to, I see it.</i>

1306
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:57,048
<i>The same kind of envelope
Nancy always uses,</i>

1307
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:59,676
<i>but there's no letter inside of it.</i>

1308
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:04,222
<i>There's something soft,
something that ought to be alive,</i>

1309
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:07,142
<i>a hunk of meat and bone
that ought to be the index finger</i>

1310
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:09,936
<i>of the right hand of a 19-year-old girl.</i>

1311
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:12,147
<i>How the hell did they find her?</i>

1312
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:14,023
<i>She was so careful.</i>

1313
01:34:14,107 --> 01:34:16,985
<i>She never gave away
where she lives or where she works.</i>

1314
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:25,493
<i>I've got to get out.
I've got to help her.</i>

1315
01:34:25,577 --> 01:34:30,540
<i>Nothing else matters.
Not my life and not my pride, either.</i>

1316
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:33,418
<i>It's only one final
surrender they want.</i>

1317
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:36,921
<i>You got me, Roark. You beat me.</i>

1318
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:41,426
<i>I say everything they want to hear,
just the way they want to hear it.</i>

1319
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:44,929
<i>I tell them I'm a twisted,
wretched child molester.</i>

1320
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:48,391
<i>I agree to everything
they want from me.</i>

1321
01:34:48,475 --> 01:34:50,351
<i>I love you, Nancy.</i>

1322
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:04,866
It's a lot of miles into town, Hartigan.

1323
01:35:07,494 --> 01:35:12,081
- You care for a ride?
- Long as you stay in front of me.

1324
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:16,044
Prison's made you paranoid.
Talk about water under the bridge.

1325
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:18,630
Christ.

1326
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:21,549
Eight years.

1327
01:35:21,633 --> 01:35:24,928
Yeah. Eight years.

1328
01:35:26,262 --> 01:35:29,224
Well, if it's any consolation to you...

1329
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:33,228
...you made me hate myself.

1330
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:38,983
- Any word from Eileen?
- Yeah.

1331
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:43,321
She got remarried four years ago.

1332
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:49,827
She had two kids. I'm sorry, John.

1333
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:54,499
Don't be. I'm glad.

1334
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:57,752
Eileen always wanted kids.

1335
01:35:57,835 --> 01:35:59,837
She'll make a good mother.

1336
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:06,094
Like you said, Bob,
water under the bridge.

1337
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:20,233
<i>Bob and I get on
with our fond farewells to each other,</i>

1338
01:36:20,316 --> 01:36:24,362
<i>then I go looking for the only
human being who means a damn to me:</i>

1339
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:25,446
<i>Nancy.</i>

1340
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:29,492
<i>How could they have found out it was
you writing all those letters to me?</i>

1341
01:36:29,576 --> 01:36:32,370
<i>How did they find out who you are?</i>

1342
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:35,623
<i>And what have they done to you, baby?</i>

1343
01:36:39,294 --> 01:36:41,421
<i>Not a sound.</i>

1344
01:36:41,504 --> 01:36:44,215
<i>No sign of life.</i>

1345
01:36:44,299 --> 01:36:48,052
<i>Has Roark gone to all this trouble
just to torture a broken old man,</i>

1346
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:51,889
<i>like a kid poking at a fly
when he's already torn his wings off?</i>

1347
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:54,726
<i>What has he done to Nancy?</i>

1348
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:57,520
<i>All she does is read
and study and write.</i>

1349
01:36:57,604 --> 01:37:03,067
<i>No diary, no phone numbers
or addresses written down anywhere.</i>

1350
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:08,031
<i>Closest thing to a clue is a pack
of matches from a lousy saloon.</i>

1351
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:13,411
<i>It's a long shot, but maybe
she's got some friends there.</i>

1352
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:23,588
<i>A dead end.
Nancy wouldn't have anything to do</i>

1353
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:25,923
<i>with a pack of drunks
and losers like this.</i>

1354
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:30,011
<i>But if there's anything to be found,
the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is</i>

1355
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:33,056
<i>or who kidnapped and mutilated her,
this is the place.</i>

1356
01:37:33,139 --> 01:37:37,935
Excuse me, miss. Wondering if you
could help me. I'm looking for somebody.

1357
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:41,648
Cold night like this, everybody's
looking for somebody, stranger.

1358
01:37:41,731 --> 01:37:44,609
It's not like that.
Her name is Nancy.

1359
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:47,153
Eyes to the stage, pilgrim.

1360
01:37:47,236 --> 01:37:50,490
She's just warming up.

1361
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:01,542
<i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan.</i>

1362
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:03,503
<i>She grew up.</i>

1363
01:38:03,586 --> 01:38:06,506
<i>She filled out.</i>

1364
01:38:06,589 --> 01:38:10,218
<i>Nancy Callahan, 19 years old.</i>

1365
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:15,223
<i>And here I was,
expecting a skinny little bookworm,</i>

1366
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:19,060
<i>maybe a bit too shy for her own good.</i>

1367
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:24,941
<i>How little she told me about herself
in all her letters for all those years.</i>

1368
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:31,656
<i>How the hell did they find her?</i>

1369
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:34,242
<i>Then it hits me.</i>

1370
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:36,452
<i>They were bluffing.</i>

1371
01:38:37,412 --> 01:38:40,331
<i>I've led them straight to her.</i>

1372
01:38:48,589 --> 01:38:51,634
<i>She hasn't spotted you yet.</i>

1373
01:38:51,718 --> 01:38:54,262
<i>Turn around and walk out the door.</i>

1374
01:38:55,388 --> 01:38:56,931
<i>Lead the creep outside.</i>

1375
01:38:57,014 --> 01:39:02,395
<i>Get that Beretta away
from him somehow, and kill him.</i>

1376
01:39:02,478 --> 01:39:06,441
<i>I'm just a horny ex-con
watching an exotic dancer.</i>

1377
01:39:06,524 --> 01:39:09,360
<i>Just a few seconds and she'll be safe.</i>

1378
01:39:10,236 --> 01:39:12,864
<i>No, Nancy. Don't notice me.</i>

1379
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:14,782
<i>Don't recognise me.</i>

1380
01:39:26,169 --> 01:39:28,212
There's no time to explain.

1381
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:31,340
I've made a terrible mistake,
put you in terrible danger.

1382
01:39:31,424 --> 01:39:33,760
We need to get out of here
right this second.

1383
01:39:33,843 --> 01:39:37,513
Whatever you say, Hartigan.
Let me throw some clothes on.

1384
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:44,395
And here I'd figured you'd forgotten
all about me. Me and my dumb letters.

1385
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:47,148
Kept me going.

1386
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:50,693
Kept me from killing myself.

1387
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:53,154
Hurry up, will you?

1388
01:39:59,952 --> 01:40:02,663
- Maybe I should drive.
- Not a chance.

1389
01:40:03,581 --> 01:40:06,501
Nobody but me
can keep this heap running.

1390
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:15,760
Besides, from the sound of things,
you might have to shoot somebody.

1391
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:18,846
- I don't have a gun.
- Under the seat.

1392
01:40:20,473 --> 01:40:22,308
It's loaded and it works.

1393
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:26,938
Yeah, this'll do.

1394
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:30,566
Taken it to the range a couple of times.
Kicks like a mule.

1395
01:40:34,695 --> 01:40:39,951
Hartigan, there's so much
I've wanted to say to you.

1396
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:42,578
You've never been
far from my thoughts.

1397
01:40:42,662 --> 01:40:46,290
I've lain awake nights,
thinking of you.

1398
01:40:46,374 --> 01:40:49,126
What are you talking about?

1399
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:54,006
Keep driving, Nancy. Keep driving
and keep the car on the road!

1400
01:40:56,801 --> 01:40:58,719
<i>She's counting on you, old man.</i>

1401
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:03,099
- What are you doing?
<i>- Prove you're still worth a damn.</i>

1402
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:11,774
Try and keep it on the road, Nancy!

1403
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:16,195
<i>He's a decent shot.</i>

1404
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:19,156
<i>He's got skill,
but he's in too much of a hurry.</i>

1405
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:22,243
<i>Throwing away bullets
like they were candy.</i>

1406
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:28,332
<i>He doesn't know how to take his time.</i>

1407
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:31,669
<i>Aim careful
and look the devil in the eye.</i>

1408
01:41:40,303 --> 01:41:42,680
Stop the car, Nancy.
Gotta confirm the kill.

1409
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:44,849
- What?
- Stop the car, now!

1410
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:48,019
Right. Stop the car, confirm the kill.

1411
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:57,528
Sorry. I got a little rattled.

1412
01:41:57,612 --> 01:42:01,782
It's OK. You did great.
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

1413
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:04,035
No! Let me stay close.

1414
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:06,662
Nothing can happen to me
when I'm with you.

1415
01:42:06,746 --> 01:42:10,082
Please? Let me stay close.

1416
01:42:19,592 --> 01:42:25,431
<i>The stink. I almost gag.
His blood smells worse than he does.</i>

1417
01:42:25,514 --> 01:42:28,517
- Jesus.
<i>- And it's all over the place.</i>

1418
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:31,312
<i>But the creep himself, he's gone.</i>

1419
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:35,274
We're out of time.

1420
01:42:35,358 --> 01:42:39,654
<i>The sirens.
I used to welcome the sound.</i>

1421
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:43,199
<i>There's nothing to do now
but find a place for the night,</i>

1422
01:42:43,282 --> 01:42:47,036
<i>get Nancy calmed down, and figure out
what on Earth I'm going to do next.</i>

1423
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:50,414
<i>The stink... somehow it stays
with us all the way to the motel.</i>

1424
01:42:50,498 --> 01:42:53,459
Nancy, I went to your apartment.

1425
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:57,463
Your window was thrown wide open.
The rooms looked almost empty.

1426
01:42:57,546 --> 01:42:59,882
That's why I was sure
you'd been kidnapped.

1427
01:42:59,965 --> 01:43:03,719
My window? Robbed again?
That's the third time this year!

1428
01:43:03,803 --> 01:43:07,431
I swore if I ever saw you again,
I'd show you I grew up strong.

1429
01:43:07,515 --> 01:43:11,102
But there I was, just like before,
scared and helpless.

1430
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:13,771
- I'm such an asshole.
- You should sit down.

1431
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:17,692
You'll feel a little bit better
if you sit down.

1432
01:43:17,775 --> 01:43:20,903
<i>I've never been all that good
with people.</i>

1433
01:43:20,986 --> 01:43:24,323
<i>When it comes to reassuring
a traumatised 19-year-old,</i>

1434
01:43:24,407 --> 01:43:28,285
<i>I'm as expert as a palsy victim
doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench.</i>

1435
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:31,330
It's always been you, Hartigan.

1436
01:43:31,414 --> 01:43:33,124
All these years.

1437
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:36,877
It's just nerves
making you say that, Nancy.

1438
01:43:36,961 --> 01:43:40,464
You're just exhausted.
You need to sleep.

1439
01:43:40,548 --> 01:43:43,759
- Sleep with me.
- Stop it, Nancy!

1440
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:46,262
Eight years.

1441
01:43:46,345 --> 01:43:49,974
Why do you think
I kept writing you those letters?

1442
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:51,976
It wasn't just gratitude.

1443
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:55,146
I tried to fall in love with boys.

1444
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:57,565
Even thought I did once or twice.

1445
01:43:57,648 --> 01:44:01,736
But I was already in love... with you.

1446
01:44:01,819 --> 01:44:04,488
That's enough. Jesus Christ!

1447
01:44:04,572 --> 01:44:06,907
I'm old enough to be your grandfather!

1448
01:44:06,991 --> 01:44:09,702
- You're just scared.
- I'm not scared.

1449
01:44:10,411 --> 01:44:12,121
No.

1450
01:44:47,364 --> 01:44:50,493
There's wrong and there's wrong
and then there's this.

1451
01:44:50,576 --> 01:44:53,037
For God's sakes, you're just a kid!

1452
01:44:53,162 --> 01:44:56,081
I love you.

1453
01:45:00,836 --> 01:45:03,297
I love you, too.

1454
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,216
With all my heart.

1455
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:09,720
<i>Cold shower. It helps.</i>

1456
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:11,138
No, Nancy.

1457
01:45:14,642 --> 01:45:16,894
Recognise my voice, Hartigan?

1458
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:20,815
Recognise my voice,
you piece of shit cop?

1459
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:24,652
I look different,
but I bet you can recognise my voice.

1460
01:45:24,735 --> 01:45:28,823
Sure. I recognise your voice, Junior.

1461
01:45:31,909 --> 01:45:34,411
<i>Everything's gone straight to hell.</i>

1462
01:45:34,495 --> 01:45:36,747
<i>I've been suckered into betraying
the only friend I've got,</i>

1463
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:40,501
<i>put her in the hands of a rapist
I thought I'd put down for good.</i>

1464
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:44,922
<i>Suckered by a spoiled brat
son of a senator.</i>

1465
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:47,007
<i>It's all gone to hell.</i>

1466
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:48,926
Klump, it's me.

1467
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:51,971
I got a dead man needs to be fetched.

1468
01:45:52,054 --> 01:45:53,931
I want you to set me up for a party.

1469
01:45:54,014 --> 01:45:56,433
I've already got the girl,
you dumb shit!

1470
01:45:56,517 --> 01:45:59,436
Hey, it better be perfect
or I'm calling my dad!

1471
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:02,189
My tools better be clean and sharp.

1472
01:46:02,273 --> 01:46:05,025
It better be ready!
It better be perfect!

1473
01:46:06,902 --> 01:46:12,283
I get to do whatever I want,
however I want, whenever I want it!

1474
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:16,120
My dad... I'd love him
if I didn't hate him.

1475
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:18,956
He spent a fortune
hiring every expert on the planet

1476
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:22,209
to grow back that equipment
you blew off between my legs,

1477
01:46:22,293 --> 01:46:26,964
just so the old fart can hold out
some kind of hope of having a grandkid.

1478
01:46:27,047 --> 01:46:30,718
Although, as you can see,
there were some side effects.

1479
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:34,805
I'm not complaining. Since you've been
gone, I'm having the time of my life.

1480
01:46:34,889 --> 01:46:38,559
And now you've led me back
to your darling Cordelia.

1481
01:46:38,642 --> 01:46:42,855
We wondered who wrote those letters.
She left not a clue.

1482
01:46:44,189 --> 01:46:47,443
Clever girl.
And so pretty, so pretty.

1483
01:46:50,112 --> 01:46:53,991
A little old for my taste,
but I can forgive that just this once.

1484
01:46:54,074 --> 01:46:57,244
Nancy, don't scream.

1485
01:46:57,328 --> 01:46:59,914
Whatever he does to you,
don't scream.

1486
01:46:59,997 --> 01:47:04,335
She'll scream. I'm gonna take
all night doing dear old Nancy.

1487
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:07,713
And you're gonna die knowing
that it's all your fault.

1488
01:47:07,796 --> 01:47:10,341
They've all screamed, Hartigan.

1489
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:13,344
Dozens of them, maybe a hundred.

1490
01:47:13,427 --> 01:47:16,472
Eight years' worth.
Every one of them has screamed.

1491
01:47:16,555 --> 01:47:18,933
If there weren't
so many people hereabout,

1492
01:47:19,016 --> 01:47:22,853
I would show you how
I'm gonna make dear old Nancy scream.

1493
01:47:22,937 --> 01:47:25,064
It's gonna be one hell of a show!

1494
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:38,535
<i>This is it. No way to fight it now.</i>

1495
01:47:38,619 --> 01:47:40,663
<i>No hope left.</i>

1496
01:47:40,746 --> 01:47:42,289
<i>No chance.</i>

1497
01:47:42,373 --> 01:47:46,168
<i>This is it. This is the end.</i>

1498
01:47:48,921 --> 01:47:49,964
<i>No.</i>

1499
01:47:50,047 --> 01:47:55,094
<i>Give it a shot, old man.
Keep your neck tight. Move.</i>

1500
01:47:55,177 --> 01:47:58,889
<i>The window, maybe there's an alarm.
The window.</i>

1501
01:47:58,973 --> 01:48:01,850
<i>Keep your neck tight, goddamn it!
Stay conscious!</i>

1502
01:48:01,934 --> 01:48:04,520
<i>Stay conscious.</i>

1503
01:48:04,603 --> 01:48:05,729
<i>No alarm.</i>

1504
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:09,024
<i>The glass! Cut the rope.</i>

1505
01:48:09,108 --> 01:48:11,527
<i>You can do it. You can do it.</i>

1506
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:13,487
It is inclement upon me

1507
01:48:13,570 --> 01:48:17,908
to comment with marked displeasure
on your rash impulsiveness

1508
01:48:17,991 --> 01:48:22,162
in selecting such an eye-catching
and impractical car

1509
01:48:22,246 --> 01:48:24,540
to heist, Mr Shlubb.

1510
01:48:24,623 --> 01:48:28,127
Irrelevant to said mission
is the following query,

1511
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:30,254
which I now put forth to you.

1512
01:48:30,337 --> 01:48:32,548
Wherein this most streamlined

1513
01:48:32,631 --> 01:48:36,510
and trunk less of transports,

1514
01:48:36,593 --> 01:48:39,430
boner-inspiring though it may be,

1515
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:44,143
wherein are we to reposit
our recently deceased cargo?

1516
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:50,941
I can only express puzzlement
that borders on alarm.

1517
01:48:55,487 --> 01:48:59,199
Tell me where Roark takes the girls
or I'll cut your damn head off!

1518
01:48:59,283 --> 01:49:00,951
In plain English, creep!

1519
01:49:01,034 --> 01:49:04,830
The answer you seek
is rural, even agrarian.

1520
01:49:06,165 --> 01:49:08,250
The farm!

1521
01:49:09,084 --> 01:49:12,045
<i>That's all I need to hear.
Every cop on the force</i>

1522
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:16,216
<i>knows about the Roark family's farm
and to stay away from it.</i>

1523
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:18,594
<i>Shlubb and Klump
were packing an arsenal.</i>

1524
01:49:18,677 --> 01:49:21,805
<i>Once things get loud,
I'll have use for the cannons.</i>

1525
01:49:21,889 --> 01:49:24,808
<i>But at first,
I'll have to play it quiet.</i>

1526
01:49:24,892 --> 01:49:27,144
<i>Quiet and nasty.</i>

1527
01:49:27,728 --> 01:49:31,148
<i>Nancy's car, six miles from the farm.</i>

1528
01:49:31,231 --> 01:49:34,485
<i>"Nobody but me can keep
this heap running," she told me.</i>

1529
01:49:34,568 --> 01:49:37,905
<i>Good girl. The car stalled out
on that yellow bastard</i>

1530
01:49:37,988 --> 01:49:40,491
<i>and you didn't tell him
how to start it up again.</i>

1531
01:49:40,574 --> 01:49:44,495
<i>You kept your mouth shut.
I'll bet Junior was furious.</i>

1532
01:49:44,578 --> 01:49:47,164
<i>I'll bet he slapped you around
something fierce.</i>

1533
01:49:47,247 --> 01:49:51,168
<i>But you stayed strong.
You bought a few extra minutes.</i>

1534
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:53,504
<i>There's still a chance, Nancy.</i>

1535
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:55,422
<i>Don't scream.</i>

1536
01:49:55,506 --> 01:49:58,175
<i>I ditch the Cara mile or so
from the farm</i>

1537
01:49:58,258 --> 01:50:00,093
<i>and make my way through the woods.</i>

1538
01:50:00,177 --> 01:50:02,721
<i>I'm not halfway there when it hits.</i>

1539
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:08,727
<i>My heart. Can't be my heart.</i>

1540
01:50:08,811 --> 01:50:10,062
<i>I was cured.</i>

1541
01:50:11,730 --> 01:50:14,650
<i>Bad cough. Blood in it.</i>

1542
01:50:14,733 --> 01:50:16,819
<i>Doesn't matter now.</i>

1543
01:50:16,902 --> 01:50:20,030
<i>I don't have to stay alive
that much longer, anyway.</i>

1544
01:50:24,743 --> 01:50:27,287
<i>Rotten way to kill a man,
but it's quiet.</i>

1545
01:50:33,293 --> 01:50:34,545
<i>Hate yourself later.</i>

1546
01:50:47,641 --> 01:50:50,894
You're only making this worse
for yourself, you stupid cow!

1547
01:50:59,987 --> 01:51:04,741
Do you think I'm tired? Is that it?
Do you think I'm getting tired?

1548
01:51:04,825 --> 01:51:07,244
You're the one who's gonna crack!

1549
01:51:07,327 --> 01:51:09,288
You'll crack!

1550
01:51:09,371 --> 01:51:12,416
You'll cry and beg!

1551
01:51:12,499 --> 01:51:14,209
You'll scream!

1552
01:51:14,293 --> 01:51:19,006
Oh, yeah, you'll scream,
you big, fat, ugly cow!

1553
01:51:19,089 --> 01:51:20,424
You'll scream!

1554
01:51:25,971 --> 01:51:28,599
You're thinking the whip
was the worst I could do?

1555
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:31,935
That was foreplay.

1556
01:51:32,978 --> 01:51:35,898
Hartigan was right about you.

1557
01:51:35,981 --> 01:51:38,442
You can't get it up unless I scream.

1558
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:41,653
You're pathetic!

1559
01:51:43,196 --> 01:51:45,282
You're pathetic.

1560
01:51:47,659 --> 01:51:50,746
It's not wise at all
to make fun of me like that.

1561
01:51:52,205 --> 01:51:54,708
It brings out the worst in me.

1562
01:52:01,298 --> 01:52:03,050
<i>Stupid old man!</i>

1563
01:52:03,133 --> 01:52:05,093
<i>In too much of a hurry.</i>

1564
01:52:06,762 --> 01:52:09,556
Damn! It can't be!

1565
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:13,810
<i>Charging in like Galahad,
just like I told myself I wouldn't!</i>

1566
01:52:13,894 --> 01:52:15,187
<i>Stupid old man!</i>

1567
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:19,274
- You tagged him good!
- No chances. Perforate the fool.

1568
01:52:24,029 --> 01:52:25,781
Good advice.

1569
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:38,585
Give it up, Junior.

1570
01:52:38,669 --> 01:52:42,172
- It's over. Let her go.
- You're dreaming, Hartigan!

1571
01:52:42,255 --> 01:52:47,177
I see your eyes while I fillet the
woman of your dreams in front of you!

1572
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:50,430
Look at you!
You're about to keel over!

1573
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:53,266
You can't even lift that cannon!

1574
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:55,727
Sure, I can.

1575
01:53:02,484 --> 01:53:05,362
You gave me a scare there
for a second there, old man.

1576
01:53:05,445 --> 01:53:08,323
Nancy, I'm sorry.

1577
01:53:09,032 --> 01:53:11,827
I'm taking no chances with you.

1578
01:53:14,329 --> 01:53:17,874
First I soften you up,
and then it's showtime.

1579
01:53:21,086 --> 01:53:23,505
Here it comes.

1580
01:53:25,132 --> 01:53:29,052
- It's gonna hurt.
- You're right about that.

1581
01:53:32,973 --> 01:53:34,891
Sucker.

1582
01:53:38,145 --> 01:53:39,980
<i>I take away his weapon.</i>

1583
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:43,275
<i>Both of them.</i>

1584
01:53:55,078 --> 01:53:58,749
Eight long years, son of a bitch!

1585
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:03,795
<i>After a while, all I'm doing is pounding
wet chunks of bone into the floorboards,</i>

1586
01:54:03,879 --> 01:54:05,088
<i>so I stop.</i>

1587
01:54:06,631 --> 01:54:09,092
So long, Junior.

1588
01:54:09,176 --> 01:54:11,720
Been a pleasure.

1589
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:20,604
I didn't scream, Hartigan, not once.

1590
01:54:22,022 --> 01:54:25,817
- I didn't scream.
- I know it, baby.

1591
01:54:25,901 --> 01:54:28,236
You grew up strong.

1592
01:54:39,748 --> 01:54:43,126
<i>By the time I get her to the car,
Nancy stops shaking.</i>

1593
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:47,130
<i>Her skin is warm again.
She's herself again.</i>

1594
01:54:47,214 --> 01:54:49,674
Thanks for remembering my coat.

1595
01:54:51,009 --> 01:54:52,969
And for all the little things.

1596
01:54:53,053 --> 01:54:57,140
Like saving my life, twice.

1597
01:54:58,266 --> 01:55:01,353
- You better get rolling.
- You're not coming along?

1598
01:55:01,436 --> 01:55:06,399
No. I have friends on their way,
to collect evidence.

1599
01:55:06,483 --> 01:55:09,194
I'm gonna blow
this whole sick mess wide open.

1600
01:55:09,277 --> 01:55:11,613
I'm gonna clear my name.

1601
01:55:11,696 --> 01:55:15,742
I'm gonna put Senator Roark
behind bars where he belongs.

1602
01:55:15,826 --> 01:55:19,371
I can't lose you, not again.

1603
01:55:21,832 --> 01:55:24,709
You'll never lose me, Nancy.

1604
01:55:37,597 --> 01:55:41,393
<i>Nancy Callahan, the love of my life.</i>

1605
01:55:42,769 --> 01:55:47,274
<i>Shame to lie to her.
I hope she forgives me for it.</i>

1606
01:55:47,357 --> 01:55:50,944
<i>Get Senator Roark behind bars? Sure.</i>

1607
01:55:51,027 --> 01:55:54,573
<i>Maybe after I've pulled off that
miracle, I'll go and punch out God.</i>

1608
01:55:54,656 --> 01:55:58,451
<i>There isn't a prosecutor in the state
who'll go after Senator Roark.</i>

1609
01:55:58,535 --> 01:56:00,704
<i>I killed his only son.</i>

1610
01:56:00,787 --> 01:56:02,873
<i>The bloodline is cut.</i>

1611
01:56:02,956 --> 01:56:05,792
<i>Roark's lost his goddamn legacy.</i>

1612
01:56:05,959 --> 01:56:08,670
<i>He'll use all his power
to get revenge on me.</i>

1613
01:56:08,753 --> 01:56:12,132
<i>He'll go after me through Nancy.
He'll find her again.</i>

1614
01:56:12,215 --> 01:56:14,885
<i>There'll be no end to it.</i>

1615
01:56:14,968 --> 01:56:17,012
<i>She'll never be safe.</i>

1616
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:19,848
<i>Not as long as I'm alive.</i>

1617
01:56:19,931 --> 01:56:22,517
<i>There's only one way to beat him.</i>

1618
01:56:23,143 --> 01:56:25,812
<i>An old man dies,</i>

1619
01:56:25,896 --> 01:56:28,148
<i>a young woman lives.</i>

1620
01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:31,484
<i>Fair trade.</i>

1621
01:56:34,446 --> 01:56:37,365
<i>I love you, Nancy.</i>

1622
01:56:44,331 --> 01:56:46,416
Yes.

1623
01:56:46,499 --> 01:56:48,668
Oh, Mom, don't go on like that.

1624
01:56:48,752 --> 01:56:54,090
It's not the city. I could've gotten
in a traffic accident anywhere.

1625
01:56:54,174 --> 01:56:57,761
Yeah, just a fracture.
The doctor said it's a clean break.

1626
01:56:57,844 --> 01:57:00,096
It should be right as rain in no time.

1627
01:57:19,324 --> 01:57:22,619
<i>Turn the right corner in Sin City</i>

1628
01:57:22,702 --> 01:57:27,374
<i>and you can find... anything.</i>

1629
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:29,167
Becky.

1630
01:57:31,086 --> 01:57:33,672
Care for a smoke?

1631
01:57:35,966 --> 01:57:38,218
Love you, too, Mom.

1632
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:42,472
<i>Anything.</i>
