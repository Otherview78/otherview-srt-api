1
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,009
<i>I had</i> a <i>vision in Amityville.</i>

2
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,729
<i>I had a premonition of your death.</i>

3
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,247
<i>We have both seen
the same inhuman spirit.</i>

4
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,041
Mom, who's that?

5
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,562
<i>The demon
in your painting is real.</i>

6
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,010
Are you certain
we're making the right decision?

7
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,885
We have no other choice.

8
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,850
Will the relic truly save us?

9
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,171
Have faith, Sister.

10
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,083
Our Father, who art in heaven,

11
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,886
hallowed be thy name,

12
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,325
thy kingdom come,

13
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,449
thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in heaven.

14
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,290
Give us this day our daily bread.

15
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,605
And forgive us our trespasses

16
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,521
as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

17
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,087
Take it!

18
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,766
This evil needs a vessel to escape.

19
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,045
It will come after you next.

20
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,610
Don't let it have you.

21
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,651
You know what you must do.
I can't.

22
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,648
Then not even God can save--

23
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,604
Forgive me, Father,
for the sin I'm about to commit.

24
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,361
Forgive me, Lord.

25
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,241
Oh, God.

26
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,726
Father Burke?

27
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,326
Bishop.

28
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,290
So, the last time
you were here was what night?

29
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,970
Six, seven years ago?

30
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,846
After my time
as a chaplain ended in the war, yes.

31
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,481
Well, we appreciate you coming again
under such short notice.

32
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,681
Father Burke.

33
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,646
Sit.

34
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,282
We have received news
that a nun has taken her own life

35
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,647
at an abbey in the mountains of Romania.

36
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,124
Suicide is a terrible, terrible sin.

37
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,890
But it doesn't strike me
as strong enough reason for a reunion.

38
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,921
But the news of it would not bolster
our argument to keep

39
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,809
with the faith and the Church.

40
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,965
You're not telling me something.
Why do you say that?

41
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,646
Because we're in the Vatican.

42
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,645
Let me put it this way, Father.

43
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,605
In this, albeit, rare instance,
we do not believe

44
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,842
we're the ones with the secret.

45
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,810
Those are your
travel documents and contact information

46
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,645
on the man who discovered the nun.

47
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,811
He lives near the Abbey
in a small village called Biertan.

48
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,725
You will want to talk to him first.

49
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,249
Also in the file is the name
of a postulant who can help

50
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,848
assist you in your inquiries
since it is a cloistered convent

51
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,366
and your access will be limited.

52
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,925
She's also familiar with the territory.

53
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,640
<i>I have survived
many terrifying encounters.</i>

54
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,084
<i>But nothing could have ever
prepared me for this.</i>

55
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,961
My only hope now was that
the beast could not smell me.

56
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,561
But then, the wind changed and...

57
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,281
Run for your lives!

58
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,683
Mother Superior says that
dinosaurs were never really alive.

59
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,321
God just put their bones here
to test our faith.

60
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,888
That seems like a pretty dirty trick,
don't you think?

61
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,685
But they're not in the Bible.

62
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,010
Well, do you believe
in penguins and koala bears?

63
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,208
Yes.
They aren't in the Bible either.

64
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,371
The Bible is God's love letter to us,

65
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,485
but it doesn't mean that
He doesn't want us to ask questions

66
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,684
about the wonders of His creation.

67
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,928
But Mother Superior says--

68
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,963
Wait a minute. You've got
a little something on your nose.

69
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,130
There.

70
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,520
Ahem.

71
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,848
Ooh!

72
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,128
The Vatican?
I'm as surprised as you.

73
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,162
I haven't even taken my vows yet.
Oh, he's aware of that.

74
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,129
He's waiting for you in the garden.

75
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,884
And change into your habit.

76
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,282
This is an official visit.

77
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,167
It shouldn't take
more than a few days, at most.

78
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,290
You were recommended for the journey

79
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,125
because of your familiarity
with the territory.

80
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,281
"The territory"?

81
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,809
Yes. Romania.

82
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,810
I'd never been
in that part of the world.

83
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,762
Really?
There must've been some mistake.

84
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,086
I apologize if you coming here
was a waste of your time.

85
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,443
No, no. No apology necessary.

86
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,329
Every decision the Vatican makes
is with purpose.

87
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,682
I'm sure they had
their reasons for selecting you.

88
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,726
What is it?

89
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,000
Mr. Theriault?

90
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,641
Hi.

91
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,130
Jealous husband or angry father?

92
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,001
I'm sorry, what?

93
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,722
Well, usually it's one of the two

94
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,249
when an older man
and a young, beautiful,

95
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,849
not-so-innocent girl show up on
my doorstep at this hour of the morning.

96
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,842
I beg your pardon, Mr. Theriault,
but you and I have never met.

97
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,445
Oh.

98
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,727
Oh. Then perhaps it's time we did.

99
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,041
Call me Frenchie.

100
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,521
Everyone does.

101
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,400
Mr. Theriault, we are here because of
the nun you found at the Abbey.

102
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,641
How'd you...

103
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,051
Are you a priest?

104
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,650
And she is a nun.

105
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,084
Oh.

106
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,684
Forgive me
for my impure thoughts, Sister.

107
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,761
I had no idea.

108
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,049
Never seen a nun out of her vestments.

109
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,211
Not that I'm opposed to it.

110
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,081
Excuse me.

111
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,966
Monsieur Theriault...

112
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,211
The Abbey.

113
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,281
Is it far?

114
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,043
In matter of distance, no,
but it takes time to get to.

115
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,847
If I may ask, why were you there?

116
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,007
I was delivering the quarterly supplies.

117
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,129
Apparently, the Abbey has had
some kind of arrangement

118
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,883
with the village for centuries.

119
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,291
Do you think you could
take us there sometime soon?

120
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,887
I don't think so, Father.

121
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,810
Is there someone else
in the village, then?

122
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,010
Everyone in this village
pretend like the Abbey doesn't exist.

123
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,008
Even talking about it
might get you in trouble.

124
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,411
It's settled, then. You will take us.

125
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,921
With all due respect, Father, I--
Please, Frenchie.

126
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,085
You took a plane from Rome,
a bus from Bucharest.

127
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,566
Now, my friends,
you're in the Dark Ages.

128
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,487
In the backwoods of Romania.

129
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,850
Now, you travel by horse.

130
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,568
Where are your things?

131
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,366
"The postman's charge."
Ten letters with an

132
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,521
Deliveries.

133
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,570
You have a knack for this, Sister.

134
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,440
What brings a Frenchman
to the countryside of Romania?

135
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,003
Actually, I'm French-Canadian,
but don't tell anyone.

136
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,730
Doesn't sound as romantic.

137
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,650
I came here looking for gold
but when I met the people here,

138
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,609
I just knew this was the place
I was meant to be.

139
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,801
Wanted to help them. Any way I could.

140
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,641
That's very noble of you.

141
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,245
I know.

142
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,644
Tell me, Sister,
how long have you been a nun?

143
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,485
I'm not a nun yet.
I'm still just a novitiate.

144
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,048
You still haven't taken
your temporary vows?

145
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,521


146
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,044
I didn't think there was anything
temporary about being a nun.

147
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,442
Temporary vows would help prepare me
for a life of total consecration.

148
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,000
"Would," Sister? Or "will"?

149
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,721
Whoa.

150
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,847
What happened?

151
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,370
Everything all right?

152
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,684
We walk the rest of the way.

153
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,245
The horse won't go any further.

154
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,129
Maybe you should get a new horse.

155
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,850
Well, it's not the horse, Father.

156
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,041
It's what lies ahead. He's scared.

157
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,729
The locals say it's a cursed place
and the horse agrees.

158
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,131
If I may ask, Father, why is it
the Church sends you on such tasks?

159
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,680
The Church reaches out to me
when it needs an investigation

160
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,163
into unusual phenomenon
associated with Catholicism.

161
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,282
Unofficially, they call it
"miracle hunting."

162
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,529
I thought we were here
because of a suicide.

163
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,485
We are, but it's only part
of our investigation.

164
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,441
I also have orders
from the Vatican to determine

165
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,808
if the grounds are still holy.

166
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,601
Well, I can give you
my opinion on that now, Father.

167
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,086
A result of the war?

168
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,160
Bombing raids, yes.

169
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,326
I've heard stories of how
the ground shook for days after them.

170
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,447
I've tried to find more information
on the castle itself,

171
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,801
but there's no record of it
in the village.

172
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,208
And the locals only spit
when it's mentioned.

173
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,247
-"Spit"?
Yeah, to ward off evil.

174
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,483
It's an old and silly superstition.

175
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,248
And if you ask me,
these crosses that surround the Abbey,

176
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,368
they keep the evil in, not out.

177
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,360
Did you try to contact someone inside
when you found the nun?

178
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,442
I did. No one responded.

179
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,490
But then again, in the two years
I've been delivering supplies,

180
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,890
she was the first nun I'd seen.

181
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,363
Frenchie, when you found
the nun, what did you do?

182
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,127
I moved it to protect the body
from the elements.

183
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,611
Where did you move it to, son?

184
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,243
In the icehouse.
It's where I leave my deliveries.

185
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,682
When I found the sister,
I thought maybe moving her in here

186
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,649
would help preserve her.

187
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,447
Uh...

188
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,609
I should tell you
one more thing, Father.

189
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,681
What?

190
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,051
That's not how I left her.

191
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,440
What do you mean?

192
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,285
She was laying down
when I left her here.

193
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,646
Not like that, sitting up.

194
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,968
There have been cases
of bodies twitching or sitting up,

195
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,405
not long after death.

196
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,644
Yeah, but, Father, who knows how long
she was dead when I found her?

197
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,846
You're not helping.

198
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,401
Sorry.

199
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,446
Father, what is it?

200
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,921
It seems to be a key of some kind.

201
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,449
That's the door the nuns would
enter from to retrieve the supplies.

202
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,011
So they wouldn't have to
leave the castle.

203
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,129
We should give her a proper burial.

204
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,969
It was common practice
during the plague.

205
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,849
When people feared to be buried alive.

206
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,329
If you were unfortunate enough
for it to happen,

207
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,200
you could ring the bell
to let those above ground know

208
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,961
they have made a mistake.

209
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,963
I think being here is a mistake.

210
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,241
That's where I found her.

211
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,684
How is that possible? It's been weeks.

212
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,811
I told you. This place is...

213
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,763
What's the opposite
of a miracle, Father?

214
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,887
Hello?

215
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,246
Please excuse us
for our unannounced arrival.

216
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,881
Hello?

217
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,083
What is it you want?

218
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,203
I'm Father Anthony Burke.

219
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,524
This is Sister Irene.

220
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,685
Are you the Reverend Mother?

221
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,641
lam.

222
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,326
You haven't taken your vows yet.

223
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,201
Uh...

224
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,685
No.

225
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,888
Please--
Why are you here, Father?

226
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,285
We come on behalf of Rome,

227
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,931
to inquire about the recent death
in your convent.

228
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,170
"Recent death"?

229
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,206
One of your nuns.

230
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,683
I found her outside.
Hanged from the neck.

231
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,244
Would you allow us
a moment, please?

232
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,888
You should leave with him.

233
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,966
Are you saying you weren't aware
of the recent passing of the nun?

234
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,563
Rome is concerned about the safety
and well-being of your cloister.

235
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,720
I'd like to speak with the sisters

236
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,246
so I can offer my assurances
to the Church.

237
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,443
I can offer
the assurance you seek.

238
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,968
I'm afraid that won't suffice.

239
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,884
They will just send more, and perhaps
less diplomatic, church officials.

240
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,089
Yes, Father.

241
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,650
However, the gate
will be closing shortly

242
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,371
as we are about to take our vespers.

243
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,886
Followed by the Great Silence
which ends midmorning.

244
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,804
Come back tomorrow
and you will find the answers you seek.

245
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:22,243
There is lodging in the convent.
You may stay there.

246
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,926
Thank you.

247
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,131
Why could you not
talk to the sisters now?

248
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,326
Why must it wait till morning?

249
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,890
The sisters take a vow of silence
from sunset to sunrise

250
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,405
that must be respected.

251
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,689
You should begin heading back yourself.

252
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,129
I imagine you don't want to be caught
on those roads when night falls.

253
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,769
Better the roads than here, Father.

254
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,211
We'll be fine, son.
Come back in a few days.

255
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,042
That should give us enough time
to get what we need.

256
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,241
Yes, Father.

257
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,326
Hello?

258
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,801
Hey-

259
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,721
Hey!

260
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,602
I'll take
 that.

261
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,081
Okay.

262
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,647
All right.

263
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,644
Father?
Hmm?

264
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,962
You mentioned "miracle hunting" before.

265
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,441
Is that...

266
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,204
Is that a role you sought out?

267
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,281
No.

268
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,161
God, no.

269
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,641
I'm a part of a small
select few the Church relies on to

270
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,965
look into their more

271
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,451
unusual matters.

272
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,091
<i>So, you know Bishop Fume'?</i>

273
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,881
How do you...

274
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,564
Because he helped me when I was younger.

275
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,368
I had a series of visions
when I was a girl.

276
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,761
My father believed
I was mentally unstable.

277
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,731
Or worse, a liar.

278
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,368
But word of my visions
reached the Church.

279
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,044
Cardinal Conroy, specifically.

280
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,043
And he sent Bishop Forne
to meet with me.

281
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,766
What were your visions?

282
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,448
There were many.

283
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,840
Never the same one repeated.

284
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,410
But after each one ended,

285
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,801
the same thought
would be stuck in my head.

286
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,322
Which was what?

287
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,685
"Mary points the way."

288
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,961
What is it, Father?

289
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,725
I was thinking of a similar incident
I encountered in France. During the war.

290
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,404
<i>I was stationed there. Near Lyon.</i>

291
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,887
I was told to investigate
a boy with visions.

292
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,845
But, unlike your case,

293
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,087
after what I believe
was careful evaluation,

294
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,604
I made the judgment he was possessed,

295
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,250
and proceeded to act accordingly
within the laws of the Church.

296
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,211
My God. Daniel...

297
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,770
What have they done to you?

298
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,571
Was it a success?

299
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,891
The Church thought so.

300
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,046
They believed the evil was cast out.

301
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,841
But not you.

302
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,090
Most Glorious Prince

303
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,130
of the Heavenly Armies,
St. Michael, the archangel...

304
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,241
Help me, Father!

305
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,091
Come to the assistance of Daniel,
whom God has made in His likeness!

306
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,840
Behold the Cross of the Lord!
Why won't you help me?

307
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,921
Ye hostile forces!

308
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,809
Daniel sustained severe injuries
during the exorcism.

309
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,484
<i>Ones from which he could not recover.</i>

310
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,123
Daniel, I'm so sorry.

311
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,242
He died days later.

312
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,527
I often wonder if I was too eager
with my determination.

313
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,766
That is a puzzle.

314
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,321
Father.

315
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,241
Father.

316
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,921
Daniel?

317
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,326
Wait! No! Help!

318
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,051
Help! No!

319
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,804
Help!

320
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,481
Somebody.

321
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,129
Help! Sister Irene! Help!

322
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,366
Father! Father?

323
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,327
Father?

324
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,041
Father?

325
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,847
Help!

326
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,481
Help me!

327
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,528
- Father?
- Sister?

328
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,971
Sister Irene!

329
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,280
Father, I can hear you!

330
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,249
I'm right here!

331
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,650
Oh, thank God. Thank you.

332
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,930
Hurry!

333
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,521
Wait! Wait!

334
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,804
Thank you. Thank you, Sister.

335
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,045
How did you get in there?
The ground was covered.

336
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,445
There is a powerful evil presence
in this place.

337
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,126
Maybe those books will help
shine a light on our answer.

338
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,326
There's more of it.
How is that possible?

339
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,644
Another puzzle.

340
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,126
Abbess?

341
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:17,164
As requested,
we are here to speak with the nuns.

342
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,128
It seems like that's as much
as an invitation as we'll get.

343
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,120
I'll go find the Abbess.

344
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,481
Take this.

345
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,764
See what you can find out about it.

346
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,607
It was obviously important
to the deceased.

347
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,286
Sister. Be careful, please.

348
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,326
I will, Father.

349
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,121
Hello?

350
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,401
Wait!

351
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,331
Sister?

352
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,521
Sister!

353
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,320
We mustn't stop praying,
even for a second.

354
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,850
This convent has had
perpetual adoration for centuries.

355
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,526
The sisters pray in shifts
to maintain a constant vigil.

356
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,444
I am so sorry to have disturbed her.

357
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,366
Sister Ruth has withstood more than
just someone sneaking up behind her.

358
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,930
I'm Sister Oana.
We were told you were coming.

359
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,611
Please, follow me.

360
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,407
What?

361
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,846
Another round.
I told Luca it was on the house.

362
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,487
Why did she cover the mirror?
It's tradition here when someone dies.

363
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,609
You cover the mirror, so the deceased
doesn't see their reflection

364
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,966
and become a ghost.

365
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,841
Someone died?

366
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:45,081
You didn't hear?
Luca's daughter committed suicide.

367
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,609
I can't believe it. She was just a kid.

368
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,167
Twelve years old.
Hanged herself in his barn.

369
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,411
Hanged herself? Why?

370
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,651
Why did Addi Constantine's crop
turn to dust?

371
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,842
Why was little Stefan struck blind?

372
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,321
It is that place. The Abbey.

373
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,286
Whatever evil is up there,
it's leaking out, poisoning us.

374
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,121
And that couple you took
up there yesterday.

375
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,521
Who were they?
Priest and a nun.

376
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,001
Are they still up there?

377
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,122
Yeah. Pick them up tomorrow.

378
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,081
You recently discovered a body
up there, didn't you?

379
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,810
Yeah, Grigore, yeah.

380
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,327
Well, I believe you're about
to discover two more.

381
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,005
"And out of the ground
formed every beast of the field

382
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,805
"and every bird of the sky.

383
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:06,004
"And whatever the man called
the demon creature, that was its name."

384
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,481
"Valak.

385
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,446
"The Defiler.

386
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,367
"The Profane.

387
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,285
"The Marquis of Snakes."

388
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,201
Sister!

389
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,406
Sister Irene!

390
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,566
Sister Victoria's death
was a terrible tragedy for the convent,

391
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,322
but we still feel her presence.

392
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,527
She was the most devoted
out of any of us.

393
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,846
Excuse me, Sister.

394
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,245
Sister...

395
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,242
Forgive us, we're highly protective
of our privacy.

396
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,605
Some of the sisters would prefer
I not speak to you at all.

397
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,649
We appreciate your willingness to do so.

398
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,571
Sister Oana, can you tell me about
the history of this Abbey?

399
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,766
It was built by a duke in the Dark Ages.

400
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,445
<i>The Duke of St. Carta.</i>

401
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,843
<i>He wrote countless texts
on witchcraft and rituals,</i>

402
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,242
in which to call upon
the forces of hell.

403
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,603
Hell used him to open a gateway
so that an unspeakable evil

404
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,841
<i>would walk amongst us.</i>

405
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,764
<i>But the Church stormed the castle.</i>

406
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,927
They sealed the gateway
using an ancient relic

407
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,127
<i>containing the blood of Jesus Christ.</i>

408
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,122
<i>The Church claimed the castle
for their own</i>

409
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,884
<i>and our perpetual praying began</i>

410
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,725
<i>to secure the Abbey
and contain the evil.</i>

411
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,806
<i>For centuries it worked
and evil was kept at bay</i>

412
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,081
<i>until the bombs of war shook the Abbey</i>

413
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,411
and evil found another way
to open the gateway.

414
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,560
Sister Oana, last night in the chapel,

415
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,641
I saw a nun.

416
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:02,407
She was... She felt anything but holy.

417
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,851
Do you see her, too?

418
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,642
I've seen her stalking
the hallways at night.

419
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,486
<i>We all have.</i>

420
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,483
<i>She looks like us,
but she's not one of us.</i>

421
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,481
It's something unholy.

422
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,647
It takes on different forms to
deceive us and prey on our weaknesses.

423
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,961
It appears as a nun
so it can hide among our cloister

424
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,565
<i>until it can corrupt us all.</i>

425
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,010
I fear her presence
means the portal has opened again.

426
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,281
It made Sister Victoria
commit the ultimate sin.

427
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,521
Sister Oana.

428
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,561
Sister Ruth is nearly finished
with her prayers.

429
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,451
It's time you attend to yours.
Yes, Sister.

430
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,369
You haven't taken your vows yet?

431
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,486
No.
Then this is not a place for you.

432
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,845
- You need to leave now.
- She can't.

433
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,801
The gates have closed.
You must stay until they open again.

434
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,770
When do they open?

435
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,366
Sunrise.
You must stay the night.

436
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,601
Sister Irene.

437
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,441
Good night, Sister.

438
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,241
Sister, wait.

439
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,081
Yes?

440
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,321
Sister Victoria had this
in her possession when she died.

441
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,325
Do you happen to know what it's for?

442
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,921
No.

443
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,291
Now, please, I must go pray.

444
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,326
Where are you?

445
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:36,405
You won't find
another way in, Father.

446
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,241
Abbess?

447
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,720
What is it that concerns you?

448
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,884
I'm afraid there's something
very wrong with this place, Abbess.

449
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:12,564
Like many places in this world,
the Abbey has a long history.

450
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,968
Not all good but we repent.

451
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,883
That nun, I found her
clutching the key in her hands.

452
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,564
What does it open, Abbess?

453
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,641
It's too late, Father.

454
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,401
Sister Irene is lost.

455
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,441
Abbess?

456
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,521
Abbess?

457
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,770
<i>Sister</i> Irene.

458
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,805
<i>Mary points the way.</i>

459
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,843
<i>Mary points the way.</i>

460
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,325
<i>Mary points the way.</i>

461
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,722
Who are you?

462
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,404
God save you.

463
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,762
Sister, please come.

464
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,326
Sister Oana?

465
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,241
Oh, God.

466
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,801
Quiet.

467
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,490
The evil grows stronger.

468
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,168
Get your things and meet me
in the chapel, Sister.

469
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,203
Only prayer will get us through
the night.

470
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,242
Go. Leave.

471
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,721
Now.

472
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,241
Hello?

473
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,047
Sister Oana?

474
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:51,327
How long
have I been dead, Father?

475
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,565
How long?

476
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,321
Daniel?

477
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,761
I'm sorry.

478
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,370
Why won't you help me?

479
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,809
We need to pray, now.

480
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,931
And whatever happens,
whatever you may see or hear,

481
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,407
keep your eyes forward
and don't stop praying.

482
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:21,208
<i>That's the door the nuns would
enter from to retrieve the supplies.</i>

483
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,044
<i>So they wouldn't have to
leave the castle.</i>

484
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,527
No, no.

485
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,050
Holy mother of God.

486
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,686
Frenchie!

487
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,171
Thought you could use some help.

488
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,521
Thank you.

489
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:52,406
But please, by all means,
next time, do use the shotgun.

490
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,682
Well, I'm saving that
for emergencies, Father.

491
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,601
Sister!

492
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:52,807
Sister Irene!

493
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,281
Father Burke.

494
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,011
It's Father Burke. He will help us.

495
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,640
Sister!

496
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,126
Sister Irene!

497
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,405
Oh, thank God, Father.

498
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,369
Are you all right, Sister?

499
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,287
Frenchie?

500
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,126
What happened?

501
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,727
We've been praying, all of us together.

502
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,721
Perpetual adoration, it's the only thing
that's been holding back the evil.

503
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,121
Who's been praying?

504
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,803
All of us. The other nuns.

505
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,521
They were here.

506
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,563
They were praying when we were attacked.

507
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,121
The nuns tried to warn me.

508
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,281
Visions.

509
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:17,691
They felt so real.

510
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,126
There's no one left.

511
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,291
We have our answer, Father.

512
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,403
As if there was any doubt before,
this place is no longer holy.

513
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,321
Oh, Father.

514
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,280
Father, what do we do?

515
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,441
Get my bag, Sister! Hand me the cross!

516
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,845
Put some holy water on it. Here, hurry!

517
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,251
Please, Father, hurry!

518
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,410
Hold it down! Cover its face!

519
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:58,169
I cast out the demon in you,

520
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,130
in the name of God the Father Almighty!

521
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,964
And the power of the holy spirit,

522
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:07,409
I ask this in the name
of our Father, Jesus Christ,

523
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,370
who is coming to judge
both the living and the dead,

524
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,920
and the world of fire!

525
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,326
That felt like an emergency.

526
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,641
We're too late.

527
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,051
The evil is free.

528
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,481
No.

529
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:45,043
For the demon to enter our world,
it must possess a human soul.

530
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,649
Sister Victoria must have been
the last nun in this cloister.

531
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,841
You know what you must do.

532
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,041
I can't.

533
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,521
Then not even God can save--

534
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,771
It wasn't suicide.

535
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,800
<i>It was a sacrifice,</i>

536
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,609
<i>so the evil wouldn't take her soul.</i>

537
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,451
I did not understand
a word you just said, but, uh...

538
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,370
Soundshke
your investigation's complete.

539
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,680
So, let's get outta here.

540
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,841
We can't just leave.

541
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,968
Oh, come on. Why the hell not?

542
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,008
We have to seal the gateway,
to contain the evil.

543
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,490
The gateway is in the catacombs.

544
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,362
But we can't close it without the relic.
The blood of Christ.

545
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,768
"Christ." Jesus Christ?

546
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,844
Did the sisters tell you where it is?

547
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,891
The Abbess was found dead
in the tunnel to the catacombs.

548
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:54,731
I think I know where that tunnel is.

549
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:58,767
Good. Then, that's where we look first.

550
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,730
But, Father, before we do,

551
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,131
I'd like to take my vows.

552
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,890
Are you certain?

553
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:10,921
My visions.

554
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,843
I now know they are a miracle of God.

555
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,609
And I am ready to commit my life to Him.

556
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,283
Now, that, Sister,
is a noble act.

557
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:21,886
It's a shame, but...

558
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,651
By the authority entrusted to me,

559
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,131
and in the name of the Church,

560
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,329
I receive the vows you have taken.

561
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,369
I earnestly commend you to God.

562
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,450
That your gift of self is made one
with the sacrifice of the Eucharist.

563
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,650
And might be brought to perfection.

564
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:49,722
May the love of God
unite you forever and ever.

565
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,121
Well, there's nothing here.

566
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,441
There has to be.

567
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,640
They told me
this key unlocks a door to the relic.

568
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,884
That could be anywhere in the castle.

569
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:29,327
It is here. Don't you see it, Sister?

570
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:31,961
What?

571
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,171
Mary points the way.

572
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,566
The blood Of Christ.

573
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,451
Holy shit.

574
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,041
The holiest.

575
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:58,081
Only a true bride of Christ
can wield something so sacred.

576
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,846
Wait.

577
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:06,881
What is it?

578
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,564
Shouldn't we say
a prayer or something, first?

579
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:14,449
There's a time for prayer,
and a time for action, son.

580
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,405
Now is the time for action.

581
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,004
Also still feels
like a time for prayer as well, Father.

582
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,209
<i>"Finit hic, Deo. " God ends</i> here.

583
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,885
We need to search
everywhere to find the gateway.

584
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,810
Sister Irene, this way.

585
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,610
Hello?

586
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:21,881
Sister Irene!

587
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,566
Sister!

588
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,567
Hene!

589
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,768
Lord Jesus, in your Holy Name,

590
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:11,087
I bind all evil spirits to this fire!

591
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:15,647
Protect us from evil
with your holy light!

592
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,766
Frenchie. Help me.

593
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,441
Of course.

594
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,801
No!

595
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,291
You failed.

596
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:30,524
Just as you have failed
everyone in your life.

597
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,808
Tomorrow, a village will be missing
its idiot.

598
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,566
You should've kept running
when you had the chance, Frenchman.

599
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,204
I am French-Canadian.

600
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:58,847
Run!

601
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,441
Frenchie!

602
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,647
No!

603
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,440
Sister!

604
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:26,161
Sister Irene!

605
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,920
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

606
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:37,806
No, no, no!

607
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:47,646
Come on.

608
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,401
Okay.

609
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:22,083
I hope you don't mind.
It's called "the kiss of life."

610
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,966
- It's just called that way.
- It's just, it's not really--

611
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:28,771
Frenchie, what's your real name?

612
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,481
Maurice.

613
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,648
Thank you for saving my life, Maurice.

614
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:37,566
You're welcome.

615
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,001
We should get going.

616
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,769
Into your hands, Oh, Lord,
we humbly deliver your servants.

617
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,811
The nuns of St. Carta.

618
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,170
They served you in this life
with strength and faith.

619
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,648
Deliver them now from every evil.

620
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:31,203
And let them live with you
in perfect grace, forever.

621
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,401
Amen.

622
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,883
Thought this ground wasn't holy anymore.

623
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:42,601
It is now.

624
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,845
Will you stay on in Biertan?

625
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,888
Oh, I think I've had
my fill of Romania.

626
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,361
My father was a tomato farmer.

627
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,084
Maybe I'll try that for a while.

628
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,681
Sounds a little boring
for a world traveler like you.

629
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,967
Certainly hope so.

630
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,209
An exorcism can be very dangerous.

631
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:25,602
Not only for the victim,
but for anyone in the room.

632
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:28,843
Take Maurice Theriault,
his friends called him Frenchie.

633
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,649
He was a French-Canadian farmer.

634
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,768
Nothing more than
a third-grade education.

635
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,001
Yet, after he was possessed...

636
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,329
...spoke some of
the best Latin I'd ever heard.

637
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:44,691
And like that, an upside-down cross
started to appear from within his body.

638
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,730
Which brings me to the three stages
of demonic activity.

639
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,043
Infestation, oppression, and possession.

640
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,601
