1
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,293
Come to me.

2
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:57,838
Come to me.

3
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,383
A guardian angel.

4
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:03,261
A spirit of comfort.

5
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:06,722
Spirit of any celestial sphere.

6
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,309
Anything.

7
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:13,020
Hear my call.

8
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:18,317
Come to me.

9
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:36,979
I swear.

10
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:34,412
Thomas.

11
00:03:35,913 --> 00:03:37,373
Thomas?

12
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:39,917
What's that, my love?

13
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:42,545
What is it?

14
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:49,093
Nothing. I...

15
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:52,513
I dreamt... I...

16
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:53,889
Come here.

17
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:56,434
There's nothing
to be afraid of, hmm?

18
00:03:57,435 --> 00:04:00,354
The honeymoon was yet too short.

19
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:03,941
Take off your shoes.

20
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:08,154
I wish I could stay, my love.

21
00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:11,907
How should I have earned
such a doting wife?

22
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,243
Ellen.

23
00:04:14,285 --> 00:04:15,744
I told you not to let her
into bed.

24
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:17,705
Everything I wear,
absolutely covered in it.

25
00:04:17,746 --> 00:04:19,748
But Greta loves it here.

26
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,375
She wishes you to stay, too.

27
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:23,502
Today is of
the utmost importance for us.

28
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:25,254
One minute more.

29
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:27,131
I really must be off.

30
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,595
Goodbye.

31
00:04:41,812 --> 00:04:44,231
He has the position already.

32
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:50,488
They'll send him away.

33
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:01,999
Morning.

34
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,710
Excuse me.

35
00:05:49,004 --> 00:05:51,632
You have kept him
a quarter hour.

36
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:54,510
Forgive me, sir.

37
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:11,235
Pray, pardon me, Herr Knock,

38
00:06:11,277 --> 00:06:12,736
for my tardiness.

39
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:15,155
Your delay is providential,
my boy, providential.

40
00:06:15,197 --> 00:06:16,448
Come in, come in.

41
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,701
Still preparing the account.

42
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:23,330
Uh, and I thank you, sir,
for considering me.

43
00:06:23,372 --> 00:06:25,833
When tidings of your recent
nuptials reached my ears,

44
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:30,087
I knew it was providence.

45
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:33,716
A new husband requires
new wages.

46
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:36,051
You're too generous, sir.

47
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:39,096
Allow me to extend my
congratulations to your wife.

48
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:41,181
Thank you, sir.

49
00:06:41,223 --> 00:06:43,309
She truly is beautiful.

50
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,061
A... a nonpareil.

51
00:06:46,103 --> 00:06:48,188
Almost a...

52
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:51,900
...sylph.

53
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:56,739
Yes. Thank you, sir.

54
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,449
Uh, and I'm most eager
to proceed

55
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,867
with whatever your request,

56
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:02,119
that I might be fully engaged
with the firm.

57
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:04,580
Indeed, indeed.

58
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:06,373
Providence.

59
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:10,461
Now, I have been entertaining
dealings with a foreign count.

60
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:12,796
Very old line of nobility.

61
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:16,258
Very old and... eccentric.

62
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,471
He wishes to acquire a home
here in our Wisburg.

63
00:07:20,512 --> 00:07:21,805
-Oh, yes?
-To retire here.

64
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:23,974
He has one foot in the grave,
so to speak.

65
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:27,770
Uh, I should be pleased
to escort the gentleman

66
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:29,605
and recommend him
to our properties.

67
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:33,275
I have already selected
Grunewald Manor.

68
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:37,780
Forgive me, sir, but is it not,
well, uh, a ruin?

69
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:40,532
He requested an old home,

70
00:07:40,574 --> 00:07:42,493
and he will pay most generously.

71
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:44,703
I shall meet him tomorrow,
then-- nine of the clock?

72
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:47,790
Here is the peculiarity.

73
00:07:47,831 --> 00:07:49,625
He's too infirm to travel,

74
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:52,920
so you needs must
journey to him.

75
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:54,171
I see.

76
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:59,093
He lives in a small country
east of Bohemia,

77
00:07:59,134 --> 00:08:03,055
isolated in the Carpathian Alps.

78
00:08:03,097 --> 00:08:04,807
Oh.

79
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:11,188
It will be a great adventure,
my boy.

80
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,898
Indeed.

81
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,693
Uh, may not the count execute
the deed here when he arrives?

82
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:17,486
Oh, no, it is much too urgent.

83
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:21,156
He insists we offer him
an agent...

84
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:23,158
in the flesh.

85
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,913
And he will reward you
handsomely, my boy, handsomely.

86
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:31,542
Secure this account,
and you will secure your...

87
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,837
official position in the firm.

88
00:08:34,878 --> 00:08:36,422
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

89
00:08:36,463 --> 00:08:38,132
I shan't disappoint.

90
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:41,218
And what was the count's name?

91
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,220
Orlok.

92
00:09:07,494 --> 00:09:09,621
And I shall
have to set off tomorrow,

93
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:12,249
as it is a six-week journey.

94
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,626
But Harding has
generously agreed

95
00:09:14,668 --> 00:09:16,962
to keep you till my return.

96
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:19,423
Why have you killed
these beautiful flowers?

97
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:21,383
-What?
-Nothing.

98
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:23,677
-What are you talking about?
-Forgive me.

99
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:26,180
Uh, let us put them in water.

100
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:27,639
They will only die
in a few days.

101
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:29,391
-Throw them out.
-What?

102
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:31,477
Throw them out!

103
00:09:33,187 --> 00:09:34,855
What are you...

104
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:38,400
You cannot leave.

105
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:39,902
What is this?

106
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:41,904
I must tell you my dream.

107
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:44,406
Ellen, we have put
these difficulties behind us.

108
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:46,158
-I must.
-Please.

109
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,701
No more of
your childhood memories.

110
00:09:47,743 --> 00:09:50,245
-The doctors advised never...
-No.

111
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:51,747
It was our wedding.

112
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:55,542
Yet not in chapel walls.

113
00:09:57,211 --> 00:09:59,087
Above was
an impenetrable thundercloud

114
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:01,882
outstretched beyond the hills.

115
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:05,427
The scent of the lilacs
was strong in the rain, and...

116
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:07,471
when I reached the altar...

117
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:11,225
...you weren't there.

118
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:15,312
Standing before me,
all in black,

119
00:10:15,354 --> 00:10:18,065
was...

120
00:10:18,106 --> 00:10:19,942
Death.

121
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:23,320
But I was so happy.

122
00:10:23,362 --> 00:10:24,988
So very happy.

123
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,617
We exchanged vows, we embraced,

124
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:32,955
and when we turned around,

125
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:35,791
everyone was dead.

126
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,836
Father and... everyone.

127
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:42,381
The stench of their bodies
was horrible.

128
00:10:44,174 --> 00:10:46,468
And...

129
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,555
But I'd never been so happy

130
00:10:49,596 --> 00:10:51,390
as that moment...

131
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:56,144
...as I held hands with Death.

132
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,446
Never speak these things aloud.

133
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:07,781
Never.

134
00:11:07,823 --> 00:11:09,491
It is a trifle, a foolish dream,

135
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:11,618
just as your past fancies.

136
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,328
Everything is well.

137
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:19,877
It portends
something awful for us.

138
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:22,004
Look, when I return,

139
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:23,714
I will finally
make something of myself.

140
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:25,716
I shall buy us a fine house
of our own with a maidservant...

141
00:11:25,757 --> 00:11:28,260
We needn't any of that.

142
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:29,845
I wish you to have
all you deserve.

143
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,931
You mustn't leave.
I love you too much.

144
00:11:40,898 --> 00:11:43,400
Pray, stop.

145
00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:51,575
Never since
our school days, Tom.

146
00:11:52,326 --> 00:11:54,912
-From my grandfather, the best.
-Uh, uh, no, I oughtn't.

147
00:11:54,953 --> 00:11:57,748
Uh, it's worth celebrating
your adventure.

148
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:00,876
Thank you.

149
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:02,753
Mm.

150
00:12:02,794 --> 00:12:05,380
-I envy you.
-Mm.

151
00:12:05,422 --> 00:12:06,798
I-I envy you.

152
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,383
You've truly taken
your father's place now.

153
00:12:08,425 --> 00:12:09,885
It's incredible.

154
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:12,346
The bloody responsibility,
it's crushing, Thomas, crushing.

155
00:12:12,387 --> 00:12:13,972
Of course,
it's unseemly to complain

156
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:15,849
with all the earnings,
but the demands of the market

157
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:18,185
grow faster than
the damned shipyard.

158
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:21,188
And my two girls-- two, Tom.

159
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:25,901
I... I love them
more than the world.

160
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:28,612
And...
speak none of this to Ellen

161
00:12:28,654 --> 00:12:33,450
or my Anna, but we have
another on the way.

162
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:37,579
-Mm-hmm.
-Congratulations.

163
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,707
Hey, you always were
a rutting goat.

164
00:12:44,378 --> 00:12:47,047
-I cannot resist her.
-Mm.

165
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:50,842
And when will you two newlyweds?

166
00:12:50,884 --> 00:12:52,970
When I'm no longer a pauper.

167
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:54,763
Uh, Friedrich, when I have,
I mean to say,

168
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:56,348
I shall finally
be able to return

169
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,768
-the moneys you loaned me.
-Not another word.

170
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,770
-Uh, and, Friedrich?
-Hmm?

171
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:03,814
Do take care of Ellen.

172
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:05,774
She nearly begged me
to remain here.

173
00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:08,819
And toss aside
your fine opportunity?

174
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:12,155
I fear her past, uh,
melancholy returning.

175
00:13:12,197 --> 00:13:14,282
Naturally.
Her dashing young husband's

176
00:13:14,324 --> 00:13:16,284
leaving her bedside cold.

177
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:18,620
My sweet ones,
it's time now for bed.

178
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:20,706
Papa! Papa!

179
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:22,124
No!

180
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:23,625
Listen, then, to your mother.

181
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,377
The time has simply come.
Enough now.

182
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:26,962
-Come on. All right.
-Come.

183
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:30,048
We can't!
There is a monster in the room!

184
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,592
Papa! Papa!

185
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:35,387
Don't let her feed me
to the monster.

186
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:36,596
Stab him!

187
00:13:36,638 --> 00:13:39,307
Pardon us,
but I am to hunt a monster.

188
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:41,768
You're a perfect child yourself.

189
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,020
-Good night.
-Good night.

190
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:44,813
Up we go. Come.

191
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:46,565
Papa, please stay with us!

192
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:49,359
I will stay with you
until you are fast asleep.

193
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:52,154
I can hear him breathing
beneath my bed!

194
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:55,699
Nonsense, my darling.
You are safe and sound.

195
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:57,159
Forgive me.

196
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,661
I have put these fancies
behind me.

197
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:01,288
I have.

198
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:03,540
And we have each other.

199
00:15:31,586 --> 00:15:36,299
Your lordship, it is entirely
as you have demanded.

200
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:38,760
He shall presently be
in thy rule,

201
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:41,555
and I shall attend thee here,

202
00:15:41,596 --> 00:15:45,016
near the object of thy contract!

203
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:03,285
-I'm proud of you.
-Mm.

204
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:07,998
Please keep safe.

205
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,000
Have you so little faith in me?

206
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,669
I will send you my utmost faith.

207
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:16,298
And you will write to me
every day.

208
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:18,758
I shall. I promise.

209
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,429
Remember, it's all for us.

210
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:28,685
-I love you.
-I love you.

211
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,688
Farewell.

212
00:18:06,074 --> 00:18:08,201
Thank you.

213
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:09,244
Okay.

214
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:22,549
I'm sorry. Sorry, no.

215
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:46,341
Uh, forgive me. I-I only wish
to stay one night.

216
00:19:46,383 --> 00:19:48,301
I have an audience
at the castle.

217
00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:50,512
Castle Orlok,
beyond the Arnyék Pass...

218
00:19:59,771 --> 00:20:01,856
I am weary, I-I pray you.

219
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:03,691
Go.

220
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:06,611
I will pay double the board.

221
00:23:23,474 --> 00:23:26,102
No, by the grace of God!

222
00:23:48,124 --> 00:23:50,293
Hello?

223
00:23:53,087 --> 00:23:55,131
My horse?

224
00:28:38,831 --> 00:28:41,918
You are late.

225
00:28:43,794 --> 00:28:49,383
The midnight hour has passed.

226
00:28:49,425 --> 00:28:55,681
And my attendants
have all retired.

227
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:58,059
Forgive me, Count.

228
00:29:36,055 --> 00:29:41,102
Leave there your conveniences.

229
00:29:41,143 --> 00:29:45,731
Set out the deed and sit.

230
00:29:48,317 --> 00:29:51,404
Would you not wish to wait
till morning?

231
00:29:51,445 --> 00:29:55,783
I wish you to do as I request.

232
00:29:55,825 --> 00:29:58,119
Yes.

233
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,871
Of course, sir.

234
00:30:00,913 --> 00:30:02,498
Lord.

235
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,291
Pardon me, sir?

236
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:06,210
Your lord.

237
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:08,045
I will be addressed

238
00:30:08,087 --> 00:30:12,133
as the honor of my blood
demands it.

239
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,720
Yes, my lord.

240
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:17,722
Forgive me, my lord.

241
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:23,310
Pray...

242
00:30:23,352 --> 00:30:25,021
sit.

243
00:30:25,062 --> 00:30:27,273
Thank you, my lord.

244
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:32,028
I am most impatient

245
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:37,533
to bring my eyes
on your covenant papers.

246
00:30:39,201 --> 00:30:41,954
And my correspondence

247
00:30:41,996 --> 00:30:47,043
with your proprietor,
Herr Knock.

248
00:30:48,878 --> 00:30:52,798
I have long awaited them.

249
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,508
Of course, my lord.

250
00:31:04,685 --> 00:31:06,771
Drink.

251
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:35,800
I have, my lord...
uh, I have questions

252
00:31:35,841 --> 00:31:39,929
about the, um, unfamiliar
customs of the peasantry

253
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,182
and the errant wanderers.

254
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:47,311
Last night, I saw...

255
00:31:47,353 --> 00:31:50,064
or, rather, I believe I saw
a band of gypsies.

256
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:53,359
They ventured to
a small birch grove and...

257
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,822
I fear we yet keep close

258
00:31:57,863 --> 00:32:00,825
many superstitions here

259
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:04,245
that may seem backward

260
00:32:04,286 --> 00:32:09,125
to a young man
of your high learning.

261
00:32:11,752 --> 00:32:15,256
These gypsies,
they exhumed a corpse.

262
00:32:15,297 --> 00:32:19,760
It is their filthy ritual.

263
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,930
What manner of ritual...

264
00:32:22,972 --> 00:32:25,099
Speak not of it again!

265
00:32:28,477 --> 00:32:32,398
How I look forward to retiring

266
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:36,318
to your city of a modern mind...

267
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:41,282
...who knows nothing of

268
00:32:41,323 --> 00:32:47,788
nor believes
any such morbid fairy tales.

269
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:53,169
Eat.

270
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:03,470
You are married, Herr Hutter?

271
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,558
Take heed what you do.

272
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,313
It's nothing.

273
00:33:12,354 --> 00:33:17,193
I might ease your wound.

274
00:33:22,823 --> 00:33:24,950
Come by the fire.

275
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:30,164
Your face shows you unwell.

276
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,452
Wait for me!

277
00:34:09,745 --> 00:34:10,996
Careful, children.

278
00:34:11,038 --> 00:34:13,207
Keep from that filth.

279
00:34:13,249 --> 00:34:14,541
Catch me!

280
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:18,212
Do you ever feel at times
as if you were not...

281
00:34:18,254 --> 00:34:20,756
as if you were not a person?

282
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:24,051
-Well, I...
-What I wish to say is that

283
00:34:24,093 --> 00:34:27,888
you are not truly present
nor alive,

284
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,432
as if you were at the whim
of another, like a doll,

285
00:34:30,474 --> 00:34:33,394
and someone or something
had the power

286
00:34:33,435 --> 00:34:35,813
to breathe life into you,

287
00:34:35,854 --> 00:34:37,481
to move you.

288
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:40,693
Well, of course we all feel
out of sorts at times.

289
00:34:40,734 --> 00:34:43,529
It's not out of sorts.
It's... it's as if there is

290
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:49,076
something at play that is
too awful or grave to explain.

291
00:34:49,118 --> 00:34:51,829
-God.
-No, my lovely Anna.

292
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,247
I...

293
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:56,333
Look at the sky.
Look at the sea.

294
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:59,545
Does it never call to you,
urge you?

295
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:01,505
Something is close at hand.

296
00:35:01,547 --> 00:35:03,257
That is his power.

297
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:05,217
A gentle breeze from heaven.

298
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:07,094
Destiny!

299
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,221
My sweet romantic.

300
00:35:14,476 --> 00:35:16,145
I am not mad, Anna.

301
00:35:16,186 --> 00:35:17,730
Leni.

302
00:35:17,771 --> 00:35:19,356
Forgive me.

303
00:35:19,398 --> 00:35:22,401
Everything I say
sounds so childish.

304
00:35:22,443 --> 00:35:26,280
Your words spring
from your honest heart.

305
00:35:26,322 --> 00:35:29,325
My heart is lost
without my Thomas.

306
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:47,468
Hello?

307
00:35:48,761 --> 00:35:50,596
Count?

308
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:46,503
And your signature

309
00:37:46,545 --> 00:37:49,465
as solicitor.

310
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:53,510
How careless of me, my lord.

311
00:37:56,263 --> 00:38:00,726
The language of my forefathers.

312
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:05,230
Of course.

313
00:38:06,648 --> 00:38:10,444
A maiden's token, I see.

314
00:38:10,486 --> 00:38:13,155
Your bride?

315
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:14,948
Just so. It, uh...

316
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,283
Yes.

317
00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:18,494
May I?

318
00:38:28,086 --> 00:38:30,506
We are newly married of late.

319
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:32,382
Incidentally,
I have letters to her

320
00:38:32,424 --> 00:38:34,635
I would post, if I may.

321
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:42,643
What was that, my lord?

322
00:38:43,977 --> 00:38:49,608
You are fortunate in your love.

323
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:53,570
It's providence,
as Herr Knock would say.

324
00:38:53,612 --> 00:38:56,657
Your signature.

325
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,499
I pray...

326
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:10,587
you will indulge my pardon.

327
00:39:13,048 --> 00:39:19,555
I durst not neglect
your commission.

328
00:39:21,682 --> 00:39:23,600
Herr Hutter.

329
00:40:11,273 --> 00:40:16,903
Now are we neighbors.

330
00:40:16,945 --> 00:40:19,281
It is my good fortune, my lord.

331
00:40:21,408 --> 00:40:22,993
Forgive my asking, my lord,

332
00:40:23,035 --> 00:40:27,247
but why such an antique
residence as Grunewald Manor?

333
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:30,292
The covenant is signed.

334
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:32,127
Of course.

335
00:40:33,045 --> 00:40:35,213
Well, I thank you
and congratulate you

336
00:40:35,255 --> 00:40:37,049
on your new home.

337
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,634
It is late.

338
00:40:38,675 --> 00:40:42,763
You must wish to retire.

339
00:40:42,804 --> 00:40:44,264
If I may, my lord,

340
00:40:44,306 --> 00:40:46,516
i-if I may be slightly unsubtle
in my approach,

341
00:40:46,558 --> 00:40:48,852
I-I wish to depart as soon as...

342
00:40:48,894 --> 00:40:51,647
well, as soon as agreeable
my services rendered.

343
00:40:51,688 --> 00:40:53,357
I am much...

344
00:40:53,398 --> 00:40:56,360
I have been enduring
the most irregular dreams.

345
00:40:56,401 --> 00:40:57,944
I fear I am taken ill.

346
00:40:57,986 --> 00:41:03,825
It is a black omen
to journey in poor health.

347
00:41:03,867 --> 00:41:08,580
You will remain
and well rest yourself.

348
00:41:08,622 --> 00:41:10,707
Uh, I must object, my lord.

349
00:41:10,749 --> 00:41:14,461
You will obey this, my counsel.

350
00:41:14,503 --> 00:41:16,296
Uh, but, my lord...

351
00:41:19,341 --> 00:41:21,802
Count?

352
00:41:25,305 --> 00:41:27,974
Y-You have my locket.

353
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:05,747
In mild cases of somnambulism--
sleepwalking--

354
00:48:05,789 --> 00:48:08,583
it is brought on
by a congestion of the blood.

355
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:10,668
Too much blood.

356
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:15,131
Perhaps...
perhaps she was oppressed

357
00:48:15,173 --> 00:48:18,927
in a somewhat odd position
beforehand.

358
00:48:18,968 --> 00:48:23,515
Yet she has had these fits
in the past.

359
00:48:23,556 --> 00:48:25,391
-Troubled nerves and so on.
-I see.

360
00:48:25,433 --> 00:48:28,103
Well, if it continues,
let me know, but until then,

361
00:48:28,144 --> 00:48:30,146
uh, keep it from your worries,
my dear fellow.

362
00:48:30,188 --> 00:48:31,648
Yes, of course.

363
00:48:31,689 --> 00:48:34,400
I am disposed to recommend
that she sleep in her corset.

364
00:48:34,442 --> 00:48:36,027
It encourages correct posture,

365
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:38,154
calms the womb
and revives circulation.

366
00:48:38,196 --> 00:48:39,531
Yes, very well.

367
00:48:39,572 --> 00:48:41,282
And, uh,
if her stirring escalates,

368
00:48:41,324 --> 00:48:43,743
you can always tie her
to the bed.

369
00:48:46,955 --> 00:48:50,583
Oh, he's coming to me.

370
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:52,377
He's coming.

371
00:48:52,418 --> 00:48:54,629
I'll increase the ether.

372
00:49:40,508 --> 00:49:42,218
Nothing of Thomas? Nothing?

373
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,263
No. I mean, yes, I've received
nothing of any kind.

374
00:49:45,305 --> 00:49:47,807
Not even to your...
at the shipyard?

375
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:49,684
And Herr Knock?

376
00:49:49,726 --> 00:49:51,936
Still no trace of him.

377
00:49:51,978 --> 00:49:54,480
His firm is in daily chaos.

378
00:49:54,522 --> 00:49:56,357
I never liked that man. Never.

379
00:49:56,399 --> 00:49:58,359
I shall call upon his office
myself directly.

380
00:49:58,401 --> 00:50:00,111
-Please, Frau Hutter, no.
-I must discover something.

381
00:50:00,153 --> 00:50:01,487
-Oh, for heaven's sake!
-But Thomas...

382
00:50:01,529 --> 00:50:03,948
You cannot leave unaccompanied.

383
00:50:08,286 --> 00:50:11,539
I am most sensitive
to your ardent nature

384
00:50:11,581 --> 00:50:15,919
and shan't reprove you further
in this error of judgment.

385
00:50:17,921 --> 00:50:21,090
I will send someone daily
until Herr Knock is found.

386
00:50:29,724 --> 00:50:31,351
Thomas is well.

387
00:50:31,392 --> 00:50:33,811
I'm certain of it.

388
00:50:33,853 --> 00:50:35,980
Leni, it's near sundown.

389
00:50:36,022 --> 00:50:38,274
We really ought to be leaving.

390
00:50:39,776 --> 00:50:41,027
Leni?

391
00:50:41,069 --> 00:50:43,529
Just a moment longer.

392
00:50:43,571 --> 00:50:45,323
Please.

393
00:50:48,284 --> 00:50:50,119
Friedrich,
be not a churl, please.

394
00:50:50,161 --> 00:50:52,413
You mustn't be swept up
in her fairy ways.

395
00:50:52,455 --> 00:50:56,084
The entirety of the household
centers upon her whims.

396
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:57,794
I tire of discussing her.

397
00:50:57,835 --> 00:51:00,797
Think you there is no burden
upon myself?

398
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:02,173
I love her.

399
00:51:02,215 --> 00:51:04,092
She is blameless for her malady.

400
00:51:04,133 --> 00:51:06,052
Forgive me, my love.

401
00:51:06,094 --> 00:51:07,720
Dr. Sievers will pay her
another visit.

402
00:51:07,762 --> 00:51:11,099
Let us only please talk
of something else.

403
00:51:13,351 --> 00:51:15,311
How is our little
Friedrich, hmm?

404
00:51:15,353 --> 00:51:18,022
Well, hungry as always.

405
00:51:18,064 --> 00:51:20,441
-Like his father.
-Mm.

406
00:51:20,483 --> 00:51:22,235
Friedrich, in public?

407
00:51:22,277 --> 00:51:24,404
I cannot resist you, my love.

408
00:51:26,114 --> 00:51:27,031
Ellen?

409
00:51:28,825 --> 00:51:30,118
Leni!

410
00:51:33,746 --> 00:51:36,374
New patient?

411
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:38,251
Yes, sir.

412
00:51:38,293 --> 00:51:40,920
Uh, we stowed him
downstairs, sir.

413
00:51:40,962 --> 00:51:44,048
I have strictly forbidden
the use of the old cells.

414
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:46,259
-Begging your pardon, sir.
-It's out of the question.

415
00:51:46,301 --> 00:51:48,511
This is a modern hospital,
not a prison.

416
00:51:48,553 --> 00:51:52,307
A little old soul he may look,
but on my life,

417
00:51:52,348 --> 00:51:55,310
saw him screaming
and a-groaning.

418
00:51:55,351 --> 00:51:57,770
Found him at
the Luther Christmas Market.

419
00:51:57,812 --> 00:52:01,441
Killed three sheep
with his bare hands.

420
00:52:01,482 --> 00:52:03,776
And he was eating them raw-like.

421
00:52:03,818 --> 00:52:05,445
Raw!

422
00:52:44,192 --> 00:52:46,069
Good day, mein Herr.

423
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,904
I am Dr. Sievers.

424
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:50,490
What seems to be the trouble?

425
00:52:50,531 --> 00:52:52,825
No trouble.

426
00:52:52,867 --> 00:52:54,202
No trouble.

427
00:52:54,243 --> 00:52:56,621
Providence. Providence.

428
00:52:56,662 --> 00:52:58,331
I see.

429
00:52:58,373 --> 00:53:00,792
Can you tell me your name,
Herr...?

430
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:02,835
I am no one.

431
00:53:04,087 --> 00:53:07,215
I am his servant.

432
00:53:07,256 --> 00:53:11,177
And, um,
what do you have there?

433
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:15,139
Lives, gifts,

434
00:53:15,181 --> 00:53:19,268
bestowed upon me
by his lordship.

435
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,354
Look, this is a pretty one.

436
00:53:21,396 --> 00:53:24,899
His lordship likes
the pretty ones...

437
00:53:24,941 --> 00:53:26,567
...best.

438
00:53:26,609 --> 00:53:28,653
His lordship?

439
00:53:30,405 --> 00:53:33,408
He is infinity.

440
00:53:35,326 --> 00:53:39,038
Eyes shining

441
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,541
like a jeweled diadem.

442
00:53:41,582 --> 00:53:45,503
And then putrescence.

443
00:53:45,545 --> 00:53:47,922
Asphyxience.

444
00:53:54,595 --> 00:53:57,223
And devourence.

445
00:53:57,765 --> 00:54:00,977
Now, my good fellow,
why would you do that?

446
00:54:01,018 --> 00:54:03,688
It's all right.

447
00:54:06,607 --> 00:54:09,944
No one wants to hurt you,
my dear friend.

448
00:54:09,986 --> 00:54:14,740
He is coming.

449
00:54:14,782 --> 00:54:16,701
Who?

450
00:54:16,742 --> 00:54:18,035
Who is?

451
00:54:18,077 --> 00:54:22,540
'Twas he that invoked me.

452
00:54:22,582 --> 00:54:26,169
'Twas I that was chosen
to serve him,

453
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:30,923
for I know what he covets.

454
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:45,354
And he shall cast upon you

455
00:54:45,396 --> 00:54:50,610
curses, confusion,
afflictions, rebukes,

456
00:54:50,651 --> 00:54:55,114
for you have forsaken me,

457
00:54:55,156 --> 00:54:58,075
and he shall reign over

458
00:54:58,117 --> 00:55:02,747
all of your empty corpses.

459
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:09,170
Devourence.

460
00:55:11,088 --> 00:55:12,423
Devourence!

461
00:55:21,933 --> 00:55:24,018
Harding, help me.

462
00:55:35,238 --> 00:55:39,158
These hysterical spells
come over her at nightfall

463
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,285
like clockwork.

464
00:55:42,245 --> 00:55:44,789
-Cigar?
-No, thank you.

465
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:51,921
I... lament to tell you this.

466
00:55:54,006 --> 00:55:56,509
Hutter's employer, Herr Knock,

467
00:55:56,551 --> 00:55:59,303
was admitted to hospital
this morning.

468
00:56:00,888 --> 00:56:02,848
What?

469
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:04,725
Did you speak to him of Thomas?

470
00:56:04,767 --> 00:56:06,769
-He is mad.
-Mad?

471
00:56:06,811 --> 00:56:09,689
Non compos mentis.

472
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,858
And, Friedrich, he...
well, the wretched fellow,

473
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,696
while inflamed with some sort
of religious mania,

474
00:56:16,737 --> 00:56:20,616
he shares a similar motto
to Frau Hutter:

475
00:56:20,658 --> 00:56:22,827
"He is coming."

476
00:56:22,868 --> 00:56:24,620
What?

477
00:56:27,248 --> 00:56:30,293
Where the devil are you, Thomas?

478
00:57:20,551 --> 00:57:22,928
Which brings me
to the specialist.

479
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:25,306
A man by the name of von Franz.

480
00:57:25,348 --> 00:57:27,933
-Swiss.
-Swiss?

481
00:57:27,975 --> 00:57:30,019
Professor
Albin Eberhart von Franz.

482
00:57:30,061 --> 00:57:34,273
He is the sole person who may
be able to diagnose her.

483
00:57:34,315 --> 00:57:36,192
An eminent physician
and scholar in Zurich

484
00:57:36,233 --> 00:57:39,403
when I was at school,
my finest teacher.

485
00:57:39,445 --> 00:57:40,821
Send a message to Zurich, then.

486
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:44,742
No, no, he...
he's here in Wisburg.

487
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,745
Here?

488
00:57:47,787 --> 00:57:49,413
Here-here?

489
00:57:49,455 --> 00:57:50,873
Why haven't you told me, man?

490
00:57:50,915 --> 00:57:52,375
-Well...
-This is capital news.

491
00:57:52,416 --> 00:57:54,502
Damn it, man, why didn't you
think of this before?

492
00:57:54,543 --> 00:57:59,799
You see, he... von Franz is
the most learned in the field,

493
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,425
his mind staggering.

494
00:58:01,467 --> 00:58:03,135
I'll spare no expense.

495
00:58:03,177 --> 00:58:06,222
No, you misunderstand me,
Friedrich.

496
00:58:06,263 --> 00:58:09,016
It has fallen hard on me
to recommend him.

497
00:58:09,058 --> 00:58:11,310
He was tossed out
of the university,

498
00:58:11,352 --> 00:58:12,812
laughed out of his home country.

499
00:58:12,853 --> 00:58:15,398
-What?
-Grieves me to say it, but...

500
00:58:15,439 --> 00:58:18,401
he became obsessed
with the work of Paracelsus,

501
00:58:18,442 --> 00:58:20,361
Agrippa and the like.

502
00:58:22,238 --> 00:58:25,700
I am a shipman, Sievers.

503
00:58:26,659 --> 00:58:28,411
Alchemy.

504
00:58:28,452 --> 00:58:31,163
Mystic philosophy.

505
00:58:31,205 --> 00:58:33,374
The occult.

506
00:58:52,184 --> 00:58:54,729
No! Orlok!

507
00:58:59,734 --> 00:59:02,319
A black enchanter
he was in life.

508
00:59:02,361 --> 00:59:03,863
Solomonar.

509
00:59:07,658 --> 00:59:10,077
The devil preserved his soul

510
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:14,457
that his corpse may walk again
in blasphemy.

511
00:59:16,917 --> 00:59:19,378
You are lost in his shadow.

512
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,881
No. No, I must leave.

513
00:59:21,922 --> 00:59:24,633
I promised Ellen.

514
00:59:24,675 --> 00:59:26,469
Remain here.

515
00:59:27,762 --> 00:59:30,055
His evil cannot enter
this house of God.

516
00:59:30,097 --> 00:59:31,557
I promised I'd join the firm.

517
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:35,352
I came here to sell the count
a house in Wisburg.

518
00:59:36,979 --> 00:59:38,731
He cannot leave here.

519
00:59:38,773 --> 00:59:41,650
-He is bound for Wisburg.
-He cannot leave here.

520
00:59:41,692 --> 00:59:44,403
He must return
to the cursed earth

521
00:59:44,445 --> 00:59:46,030
wherein he was buried.

522
00:59:46,071 --> 00:59:49,366
No! He seeks after Ellen.

523
00:59:49,408 --> 00:59:51,368
I know it!

524
01:00:41,043 --> 01:00:44,630
I have not failed your lordship!

525
01:00:44,672 --> 01:00:48,843
Thy promised gift awaits!

526
01:00:50,511 --> 01:00:53,639
Providence!

527
01:00:54,181 --> 01:00:56,392
The scientific
community is on a crusade

528
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:58,435
to prove his work
drove him to madness.

529
01:00:58,477 --> 01:01:00,145
-Hmm.
-I assure you,

530
01:01:00,187 --> 01:01:03,023
Harding, the professor may be
a bit unconventional,

531
01:01:03,065 --> 01:01:05,150
but he will know
the source of her malady.

532
01:01:12,032 --> 01:01:13,450
Professor von Franz?

533
01:01:13,492 --> 01:01:14,827
Leave me be.

534
01:01:16,203 --> 01:01:18,205
It is your former student.

535
01:01:18,247 --> 01:01:21,000
Avaunt! Begone, I say!

536
01:01:35,097 --> 01:01:38,183
Professor, please,
I should not wish to intrude.

537
01:01:44,231 --> 01:01:45,816
Professor, please.

538
01:01:45,858 --> 01:01:48,027
I had nearly
unlocked the final key

539
01:01:48,068 --> 01:01:50,738
of the
Mysteriorum Libri Quinque.

540
01:01:50,779 --> 01:01:52,197
I'm sorry, Professor.

541
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:54,491
No. No matter.

542
01:01:54,533 --> 01:01:57,161
I miscalculated the stars.

543
01:01:57,202 --> 01:02:01,999
Hermes will not render my
black sulfur gold this evening.

544
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:04,335
Yes, we shan't
trouble you further.

545
01:02:04,376 --> 01:02:06,921
-We must take our leave.
-Just...

546
01:02:10,549 --> 01:02:12,593
Good night, Professor.

547
01:02:20,976 --> 01:02:25,147
Nolite dare sanctum canibus.

548
01:02:32,154 --> 01:02:38,077
Neque mittatis margaritas
vestra ante porcos.

549
01:02:39,495 --> 01:02:41,580
My dear young Sievers.

550
01:02:41,622 --> 01:02:43,916
Or do my dying eyes deceive me?

551
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:45,542
I should've known.

552
01:02:45,584 --> 01:02:47,002
Embrace me, my boy.

553
01:02:47,044 --> 01:02:50,506
I am so rejoiced to see you.

554
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:52,007
I sensed something.

555
01:02:52,049 --> 01:02:55,219
It brought me to Wisburg
all these years ago.

556
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:58,013
I felt it was now
imminently approaching.

557
01:02:58,055 --> 01:03:01,433
I thought it ill,
but it must have been you.

558
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,980
Now, what is the matter?

559
01:03:07,731 --> 01:03:10,192
Ah, I see, yes.

560
01:03:10,234 --> 01:03:13,904
A dear friend of yours
has some rare ailment.

561
01:03:13,946 --> 01:03:16,281
Perhaps a houseguest, yes?

562
01:03:16,323 --> 01:03:18,617
A young woman exhibiting

563
01:03:18,659 --> 01:03:22,079
protracted fits of somnambulism.

564
01:03:22,121 --> 01:03:25,124
You look tired, young man.

565
01:03:27,501 --> 01:03:29,003
Schnapps?

566
01:03:48,939 --> 01:03:52,276
Wait! You are not yet well!

567
01:03:57,656 --> 01:03:59,533
Yeah?

568
01:04:42,367 --> 01:04:44,328
Untie this child at once!

569
01:04:44,369 --> 01:04:45,954
It's all I could do to keep her

570
01:04:45,996 --> 01:04:47,539
from tearing the room
to ribbons.

571
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:49,583
Untie her.

572
01:04:54,338 --> 01:04:57,049
You are the doctor
our Sievers spoke of?

573
01:04:57,091 --> 01:04:58,217
Drugged?

574
01:04:58,258 --> 01:04:59,927
I have been administering
an opiate.

575
01:04:59,968 --> 01:05:02,179
She must rest by day,
for her body is in utter stress

576
01:05:02,221 --> 01:05:04,389
-all the night.
-She cannot be clouded.

577
01:05:04,431 --> 01:05:07,226
Step away. Step away.

578
01:05:07,267 --> 01:05:10,562
My dear creature, yes,
I am he, and I am

579
01:05:10,604 --> 01:05:12,856
hither come to help you.

580
01:05:14,191 --> 01:05:15,984
Is she yours?

581
01:05:16,026 --> 01:05:17,277
Greta?

582
01:05:17,319 --> 01:05:19,696
She has no master nor mistress.

583
01:05:19,738 --> 01:05:21,490
Quite so.

584
01:05:21,532 --> 01:05:23,242
I entreat you to excuse me,

585
01:05:23,283 --> 01:05:27,246
but I should like to begin
my consultation presently.

586
01:05:27,287 --> 01:05:31,625
You see, I have a curiosity
about you.

587
01:05:32,251 --> 01:05:35,629
Dr. Sievers tells me
that you have had these spells

588
01:05:35,671 --> 01:05:37,923
since childhood.

589
01:05:37,965 --> 01:05:40,759
Would you describe them
to me, please?

590
01:05:40,801 --> 01:05:43,345
I cannot always remember them.

591
01:05:43,387 --> 01:05:46,431
As if my spirit wanders off.

592
01:05:46,473 --> 01:05:49,268
Tell me what you can,
from the beginning.

593
01:05:50,811 --> 01:05:54,940
Sometimes it was...
it is like a dream.

594
01:05:54,982 --> 01:05:56,400
-Hmm.
-And I know things.

595
01:05:56,441 --> 01:05:59,736
I always knew the contents
of my Christmas gifts.

596
01:05:59,778 --> 01:06:02,948
I knew when
that my mother would pass.

597
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:07,035
Father, he would find me
in our fields within the forest

598
01:06:07,077 --> 01:06:10,664
as if I was
his little changeling girl.

599
01:06:10,706 --> 01:06:11,999
I see.

600
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,834
But as I became older,
it worsened.

601
01:06:13,876 --> 01:06:15,961
I frightened him.

602
01:06:16,003 --> 01:06:17,921
My touch.

603
01:06:17,963 --> 01:06:22,968
I was so very alone, you see,
and I wished for comfort.

604
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:26,930
Then a presence
and the nightmares,

605
01:06:26,972 --> 01:06:29,224
the epilepsies, I...

606
01:06:31,852 --> 01:06:34,021
Pray, continue.

607
01:06:34,521 --> 01:06:38,775
At last,
Papa found me once laying.

608
01:06:38,817 --> 01:06:41,236
Unclothed, I was.

609
01:06:41,278 --> 01:06:44,323
My body, my...

610
01:06:44,364 --> 01:06:46,658
my flesh, I...

611
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,826
"Sin."

612
01:06:47,868 --> 01:06:49,453
"Sin," he said.

613
01:06:49,494 --> 01:06:52,706
He would have sent me to
that place. I... I shan't go.

614
01:06:52,748 --> 01:06:54,875
No, no.

615
01:06:56,251 --> 01:06:59,338
It all ended
when I first met my Thomas.

616
01:07:00,631 --> 01:07:03,258
From our love,
I became as normal.

617
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,052
Yet these visions
and night wanderings

618
01:07:05,093 --> 01:07:06,845
have returned to you?

619
01:07:06,887 --> 01:07:09,640
I fear for him so.

620
01:07:09,681 --> 01:07:11,225
Professor.

621
01:07:12,768 --> 01:07:14,353
My dreams grow darker.

622
01:07:15,938 --> 01:07:19,399
Does evil come from within us
or from beyond?

623
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:27,908
Her trance state is begun.

624
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:33,330
You have bled her
to decrease the congestion?

625
01:07:33,372 --> 01:07:34,873
Of course.

626
01:07:34,915 --> 01:07:37,417
And her menstruations are also?

627
01:07:37,459 --> 01:07:39,211
Liberal.

628
01:07:39,253 --> 01:07:42,297
Too much blood. Too much blood.

629
01:07:42,339 --> 01:07:44,341
A taper, please.

630
01:07:48,929 --> 01:07:50,389
Her pupil is expanded.

631
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:52,849
It does not contract naturally
to light.

632
01:07:52,891 --> 01:07:54,851
-Impossible.
-A second sight.

633
01:07:54,893 --> 01:07:56,728
She is no longer here.

634
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:58,146
My bag.

635
01:07:58,188 --> 01:08:00,857
Forgive
the grotesque tediousness

636
01:08:00,899 --> 01:08:02,734
of this demonstration.

637
01:08:02,776 --> 01:08:04,069
The needle.

638
01:08:04,111 --> 01:08:08,115
However, I must impress upon you

639
01:08:08,156 --> 01:08:12,286
that this child is not with us.

640
01:08:12,327 --> 01:08:13,912
Professor, I do protest.

641
01:08:13,954 --> 01:08:18,083
Restrain your protestation,
for she feels nothing.

642
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:21,420
She communes now
with another realm.

643
01:08:22,462 --> 01:08:25,757
Tend to the wound, Sievers.

644
01:08:25,799 --> 01:08:27,426
Now...

645
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:30,095
Do you hear me, my child?

646
01:08:30,137 --> 01:08:32,306
And what then do you see?

647
01:08:33,348 --> 01:08:37,352
I charge you,
speak now what you see.

648
01:08:37,394 --> 01:08:40,063
Enduring night.

649
01:08:40,105 --> 01:08:42,190
A specter of death.

650
01:08:42,232 --> 01:08:47,487
He... he spreads his shadow,

651
01:08:47,529 --> 01:08:51,366
and he... he... he is coming.

652
01:08:51,408 --> 01:08:53,910
Who? Who is coming to you,
my child?

653
01:08:53,952 --> 01:08:56,371
Who, damn you? Speak!

654
01:08:56,413 --> 01:08:58,749
Yield before
this ancient talisman!

655
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:00,459
Professor!

656
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,919
I will not harm her!

657
01:09:03,837 --> 01:09:06,006
I command you,

658
01:09:06,048 --> 01:09:08,592
hearken to my voice.

659
01:09:08,633 --> 01:09:14,097
By the protection of Chamuel,
Haniel and Zadkiel,

660
01:09:14,139 --> 01:09:16,350
impart your speech unto me.

661
01:09:16,391 --> 01:09:18,060
In the name of Eligos,

662
01:09:18,101 --> 01:09:19,978
Orabas and Asmoday,

663
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:22,731
impart your speech unto me.

664
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,027
I shall persist to join you

665
01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:29,154
every night-- first in sleep,
then in your arms.

666
01:09:29,196 --> 01:09:30,655
Everything will be mixed

667
01:09:30,697 --> 01:09:33,492
with abomination, and you'll be
knee-deep in blood.

668
01:09:33,533 --> 01:09:34,951
Everyone will cry.

669
01:09:34,993 --> 01:09:37,371
There will be none
to bury the dead.

670
01:09:37,412 --> 01:09:41,124
-You are promised to me!
-Promised?

671
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:42,501
-She means her husband!
-Promised?

672
01:09:42,542 --> 01:09:45,003
Help me! Help me!

673
01:09:48,882 --> 01:09:50,842
As I feared.

674
01:09:52,803 --> 01:09:53,887
Well?

675
01:09:53,929 --> 01:09:56,348
"Well" what, my boy?
Cannot you see?

676
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:57,974
See what?

677
01:09:58,016 --> 01:09:59,643
See that she is cursed.

678
01:09:59,684 --> 01:10:01,103
-Cursed?
-Yes, cursed.

679
01:10:01,144 --> 01:10:05,315
This dear young creature
is possessed of some spirit.

680
01:10:05,357 --> 01:10:06,858
Perhaps a demon.

681
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,068
I beg your pardon.

682
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:09,319
I assure you, Harding,

683
01:10:09,361 --> 01:10:10,779
the professor means this
as hyperbole.

684
01:10:10,821 --> 01:10:13,698
-No, I mean a demon.
-You jest.

685
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:15,325
But what of your own discoveries

686
01:10:15,367 --> 01:10:17,327
of macabre
hallucination pathologies?

687
01:10:17,369 --> 01:10:18,703
This is not one.

688
01:10:18,745 --> 01:10:20,705
You cannot conceivably
have perceived all of this.

689
01:10:20,747 --> 01:10:22,541
How should this happen to Ellen?

690
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:26,461
Demonic spirits
more easily obsess those

691
01:10:26,503 --> 01:10:29,464
whose lower animal functions
dominate.

692
01:10:29,506 --> 01:10:31,967
Demons like them.
They seek them out.

693
01:10:32,008 --> 01:10:33,718
I do not wish to dispute you,
Professor,

694
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,721
but I myself have witnessed
women of nervous constitutions

695
01:10:36,763 --> 01:10:38,265
invent all manner of delusion.

696
01:10:38,306 --> 01:10:39,766
This is no delusion.

697
01:10:39,808 --> 01:10:42,853
I believe she has always been
highly conductive

698
01:10:42,894 --> 01:10:45,564
to these cosmic forces,
uniquely so.

699
01:10:45,605 --> 01:10:47,232
Your lunatic, perhaps.

700
01:10:47,274 --> 01:10:50,569
Do you then acknowledge a
connection between these cases?

701
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:52,279
That is the question.

702
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,947
Oh, this is just capital.

703
01:10:53,989 --> 01:10:56,450
I tell you, it is the manner
of her husband's disappearance.

704
01:10:56,491 --> 01:10:59,411
No. This evil--

705
01:10:59,453 --> 01:11:03,206
what it is,
how it has been summoned,

706
01:11:03,248 --> 01:11:05,625
unleashed, I know not,

707
01:11:05,667 --> 01:11:09,045
but this remarkable child
it has chained itself to

708
01:11:09,087 --> 01:11:11,131
is in grave peril.

709
01:11:12,215 --> 01:11:14,509
I must to my studies.

710
01:11:14,551 --> 01:11:16,720
Frau Harding.

711
01:11:16,761 --> 01:11:19,097
Sit with her. Observe her.

712
01:11:19,139 --> 01:11:21,099
Report her behavior.

713
01:11:21,141 --> 01:11:23,435
Sievers, no more ether.

714
01:11:23,477 --> 01:11:26,104
But she will rave all the night.

715
01:11:26,146 --> 01:11:28,398
Then rave she must.

716
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,234
There is a dread storm rising.

717
01:13:26,433 --> 01:13:29,269
-Help me. Help me!
-Oh, dear. Oh, my.

718
01:13:32,689 --> 01:13:34,399
I'll get you out.

719
01:13:34,441 --> 01:13:36,610
Don't you worry.

720
01:13:36,651 --> 01:13:38,361
Help.

721
01:13:38,403 --> 01:13:40,196
It's all right. It's all right.

722
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:41,865
-Listen.
-What was that?

723
01:13:41,906 --> 01:13:44,117
Listen.

724
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:49,581
His lordship-- he has come!

725
01:13:54,419 --> 01:13:58,590
The blood is the life.

726
01:14:00,258 --> 01:14:02,469
He's here. He's here!

727
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:04,721
His lordship is here!

728
01:14:06,473 --> 01:14:09,017
The blood is the life!

729
01:14:24,741 --> 01:14:26,201
He's here!

730
01:14:28,453 --> 01:14:30,246
Ellen?

731
01:14:40,215 --> 01:14:41,633
Thomas!

732
01:14:45,762 --> 01:14:48,264
No, no!

733
01:14:48,306 --> 01:14:50,183
Thomas!

734
01:14:52,519 --> 01:14:54,145
Thomas.

735
01:14:59,651 --> 01:15:02,070
He hasn't found you.

736
01:15:02,112 --> 01:15:04,989
I-I feared
I'd never see you again.

737
01:15:05,031 --> 01:15:06,491
My love.

738
01:15:06,533 --> 01:15:08,660
You were right.

739
01:15:08,702 --> 01:15:09,953
You were.

740
01:15:09,994 --> 01:15:13,623
He... he has your locket.

741
01:15:13,665 --> 01:15:15,792
Thomas.

742
01:15:15,834 --> 01:15:17,127
Thomas.

743
01:15:17,168 --> 01:15:18,628
What the hell is it now?

744
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:20,338
-Thomas!
-Hartmann, the door!

745
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:22,048
Very good, sir.

746
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:23,717
Thomas!

747
01:15:23,758 --> 01:15:26,344
Mama! Papa!

748
01:15:26,386 --> 01:15:28,847
Is that the monster?

749
01:15:28,888 --> 01:15:30,348
What the devil is this?

750
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:32,851
It's past 3:00 in the morning.

751
01:15:47,323 --> 01:15:49,033
My God.

752
01:15:49,075 --> 01:15:51,786
Plague. It's a plague ship.

753
01:15:53,872 --> 01:15:55,039
Damn it.

754
01:15:55,081 --> 01:15:56,791
Alert the port authority.

755
01:15:56,833 --> 01:15:59,502
-And fetch Dr. Sievers.
-Aye, aye, sir.

756
01:16:02,756 --> 01:16:05,800
There it is, your lordship.

757
01:16:05,842 --> 01:16:08,219
There it is.

758
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:30,450
The broker lives.

759
01:16:31,826 --> 01:16:36,956
I shall stifle out
the bridegroom, your lordship.

760
01:16:36,998 --> 01:16:40,418
I have use in him.

761
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,378
Pray...

762
01:16:45,423 --> 01:16:47,383
Instruct me.

763
01:16:47,425 --> 01:16:50,970
Charge me. Use me.

764
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:57,310
I shall fetch unto thee

765
01:16:57,352 --> 01:16:59,354
thy pretty belonging?

766
01:16:59,395 --> 01:17:01,731
The compact commands

767
01:17:01,773 --> 01:17:07,487
she must willingly
repledge her vow.

768
01:17:08,571 --> 01:17:11,950
She cannot be stolen.

769
01:17:11,991 --> 01:17:14,327
Yet, my lord...

770
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:16,996
I beg thee...

771
01:17:17,038 --> 01:17:19,791
Silence, dog!

772
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:24,087
Your entreaties grow insolent.

773
01:17:24,128 --> 01:17:27,465
You shall crave of me nothing.

774
01:17:27,507 --> 01:17:30,468
My lord.

775
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:34,848
Daybreak draws near.

776
01:17:35,598 --> 01:17:39,769
Anon, the bells of dawn

777
01:17:39,811 --> 01:17:44,774
shall toll in despair
of my coming.

778
01:17:48,695 --> 01:17:54,784
And I shall taste of you.

779
01:18:20,894 --> 01:18:22,687
How is he faring?

780
01:18:22,729 --> 01:18:26,024
I fear no better than everyone
tells me I have suffered.

781
01:18:26,065 --> 01:18:29,193
Pray, forgive me for all
the troubles I have caused you.

782
01:18:29,235 --> 01:18:32,030
I am only glad you have
become yourself again.

783
01:18:32,071 --> 01:18:34,449
It seems a miracle.

784
01:18:34,949 --> 01:18:36,701
Perhaps Professor Franz
was wrong.

785
01:18:36,743 --> 01:18:39,370
Perhaps it was only your wish
to see Thomas returned

786
01:18:39,412 --> 01:18:41,372
and your... your...

787
01:18:41,414 --> 01:18:43,541
My melancholy?

788
01:18:44,584 --> 01:18:46,044
-Uh, I...
-Thomas has seen

789
01:18:46,085 --> 01:18:48,463
something awful.

790
01:18:48,504 --> 01:18:50,298
If only I could speak
to the profess...

791
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,717
Hush.
His thoughts are so queer.

792
01:18:52,759 --> 01:18:54,886
Professor Franz said a demon.

793
01:18:54,928 --> 01:18:56,888
Leni, please.

794
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:59,057
For the sake of the children.

795
01:18:59,098 --> 01:19:00,934
Christmastide is upon us.

796
01:19:00,975 --> 01:19:04,062
Why must you remain
so exasperatingly contrary?

797
01:19:04,103 --> 01:19:07,065
Because I am in the right.

798
01:19:07,982 --> 01:19:10,777
Sievers, I requested conference

799
01:19:10,818 --> 01:19:12,737
with your maniac,
not a dead man.

800
01:19:12,779 --> 01:19:16,908
I beg your patience, Professor,
but this is what vexes me.

801
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:19,369
He exhibits all the signs
of a blood plague.

802
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:22,205
Sepsis, ophthalmic discharge.

803
01:19:22,246 --> 01:19:26,042
Even flagrant rodent bites
here and here.

804
01:19:27,293 --> 01:19:31,172
I fear this ship has brought
the plague to Wisburg.

805
01:19:34,717 --> 01:19:36,094
And what is confounding is

806
01:19:36,135 --> 01:19:39,138
his body is
entirely absent of blood.

807
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,768
Look at this curious mark here.

808
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:45,228
Huh.

809
01:19:45,269 --> 01:19:48,064
I've seen some leviathan-like
pests in our canals,

810
01:19:48,106 --> 01:19:53,403
but tell me, Professor,
what rat has jaws of such size?

811
01:19:53,444 --> 01:19:56,614
Angels and demons protect us.

812
01:19:56,656 --> 01:19:58,074
Where is your lunatic?

813
01:19:58,116 --> 01:20:00,785
You must take me to him
presently.

814
01:20:00,827 --> 01:20:02,620
Ain't you heard, Doctor, sir?

815
01:20:02,662 --> 01:20:03,830
No.

816
01:20:03,871 --> 01:20:05,623
Herr Knock has gone and escaped.

817
01:20:05,665 --> 01:20:06,958
What?

818
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,127
He killed the porter on duty
last night.

819
01:20:09,168 --> 01:20:11,004
This man must be found.

820
01:20:11,045 --> 01:20:12,714
Sirrah, show me out.

821
01:20:12,755 --> 01:20:14,048
Sievers, fetch Harding.

822
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:17,135
And meet me
at my residence tonight.

823
01:20:17,176 --> 01:20:20,013
This is no mere plague.

824
01:21:07,769 --> 01:21:09,896
Get off me.

825
01:21:09,937 --> 01:21:12,607
Give me room.

826
01:21:12,648 --> 01:21:14,317
Thomas.

827
01:21:14,358 --> 01:21:16,027
-I-I can't breathe.
-It's me.

828
01:21:16,069 --> 01:21:18,696
I-I can't breathe.

829
01:21:18,738 --> 01:21:20,656
Get off!

830
01:21:24,577 --> 01:21:27,455
Please you,
don't leave us, Mama.

831
01:21:27,497 --> 01:21:30,208
I promise I shan't let
anything harm you.

832
01:21:30,249 --> 01:21:32,710
No monsters. Nothing.

833
01:21:32,752 --> 01:21:34,796
Now, give me a kiss.

834
01:21:34,837 --> 01:21:36,839
And say your prayers.

835
01:21:45,556 --> 01:21:48,851
Now I lay me down to sleep,

836
01:21:48,893 --> 01:21:52,563
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

837
01:23:03,885 --> 01:23:05,469
Anna?

838
01:23:05,511 --> 01:23:07,847
Oh. Oh, you frightened me.

839
01:23:07,889 --> 01:23:10,308
Forgive me.

840
01:23:10,349 --> 01:23:11,934
Has Friedrich returned?

841
01:23:11,976 --> 01:23:14,854
Uh, uh, no. No.

842
01:23:16,731 --> 01:23:18,816
What is it, my lovely?

843
01:23:21,152 --> 01:23:23,029
May I...

844
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:25,823
stay with you tonight?

845
01:23:28,201 --> 01:23:31,704
Our friendship is
a precious balm to my heart.

846
01:23:33,998 --> 01:23:36,459
Forgive my chiding you.

847
01:23:38,002 --> 01:23:39,962
Thank you for loving me.

848
01:23:43,883 --> 01:23:46,219
You may take it if you wish.

849
01:23:52,058 --> 01:23:54,352
God is with us, Leni.

850
01:23:55,519 --> 01:23:59,690
I cannot yield
to being haunted by a ghost.

851
01:23:59,732 --> 01:24:01,067
Oh, no, please. No.

852
01:24:01,108 --> 01:24:04,862
It is no mere ghost,
for it can manifest physically

853
01:24:04,904 --> 01:24:07,490
and with the most foul intent.

854
01:24:07,531 --> 01:24:08,741
And what, pray, is that?

855
01:24:08,783 --> 01:24:11,160
Like every plague,
its soul desire

856
01:24:11,202 --> 01:24:14,205
is to consume all life on Earth.

857
01:24:14,247 --> 01:24:17,708
This creature is a force
more powerful than evil.

858
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:20,586
It is Death itself.

859
01:24:20,628 --> 01:24:23,547
I have not slept in days.

860
01:24:23,589 --> 01:24:25,549
My house has become a bedlam,

861
01:24:25,591 --> 01:24:27,385
and here I've been resummoned

862
01:24:27,426 --> 01:24:30,721
to this godforsaken habitation
for this?

863
01:24:30,763 --> 01:24:34,392
Do not tell me you believe
in such medieval devilry!

864
01:24:34,433 --> 01:24:37,103
I do not believe. I know!

865
01:24:37,144 --> 01:24:39,230
I have seen things in this world

866
01:24:39,272 --> 01:24:41,899
that would've made
Isaac Newton crawl

867
01:24:41,941 --> 01:24:44,527
back into his mother's womb.

868
01:24:44,568 --> 01:24:47,196
We have not become
so much enlightened

869
01:24:47,238 --> 01:24:51,701
as we have been blinded by
the gaseous light of science.

870
01:24:51,742 --> 01:24:53,786
I have wrestled with the devil

871
01:24:53,828 --> 01:24:56,330
as Jacob wrestled the angel
in Peniel.

872
01:24:56,372 --> 01:24:59,375
And I tell you,
if we are to tame darkness,

873
01:24:59,417 --> 01:25:02,545
we must first face
that it exists.

874
01:25:04,130 --> 01:25:06,090
Meine Herren,

875
01:25:06,132 --> 01:25:11,887
we are here encountering
the undead plague carrier,

876
01:25:11,929 --> 01:25:15,808
the Vampyr Nosferatu.

877
01:26:25,044 --> 01:26:27,380
You.

878
01:26:31,467 --> 01:26:34,387
I have felt you

879
01:26:34,428 --> 01:26:37,640
crawling like a serpent
in my body.

880
01:26:39,475 --> 01:26:42,061
It is not me.

881
01:26:43,896 --> 01:26:46,357
It is your nature.

882
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:49,026
No. I love Thomas.

883
01:26:49,068 --> 01:26:53,364
Love is inferior to you.

884
01:26:53,406 --> 01:26:58,702
I told you,
you are not of humankind.

885
01:26:58,744 --> 01:27:00,621
You are a villain to speak so.

886
01:27:00,663 --> 01:27:04,041
I am an appetite.

887
01:27:04,083 --> 01:27:06,043
Nothing more.

888
01:27:09,588 --> 01:27:14,844
O'er centuries,
a loathsome beast

889
01:27:14,885 --> 01:27:20,182
I lay within the darkest pit.

890
01:27:22,393 --> 01:27:28,190
Till you did wake me,
enchantress,

891
01:27:28,232 --> 01:27:31,569
and stirred me from my grave.

892
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:35,865
You are my affliction.

893
01:27:35,906 --> 01:27:38,951
I care nothing
of your afflictions.

894
01:27:39,785 --> 01:27:45,040
Yet even now we are fated.

895
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:49,170
Your husband has signed his name

896
01:27:49,211 --> 01:27:52,089
and covenanted you to my person

897
01:27:52,131 --> 01:27:55,134
for but a sack of gold.

898
01:27:55,176 --> 01:27:57,094
-Lies.
-For gold,

899
01:27:57,136 --> 01:28:00,181
he did absolve his nuptial bond.

900
01:28:00,222 --> 01:28:02,391
You know nothing of him.

901
01:28:02,433 --> 01:28:06,312
And the resignation
must be completed by you

902
01:28:06,353 --> 01:28:09,482
freely of thine own will.

903
01:28:09,523 --> 01:28:11,066
You are a deceiver.

904
01:28:11,108 --> 01:28:15,488
You deceive yourself.

905
01:28:16,655 --> 01:28:18,657
I was but an innocent child.

906
01:28:18,699 --> 01:28:23,329
And thought you
I would not return?

907
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:27,082
Thought you I would not?

908
01:28:28,667 --> 01:28:34,173
Your passion is bound to me.

909
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:39,929
You cannot love.

910
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:43,182
I cannot.

911
01:28:44,475 --> 01:28:49,688
Yet I cannot be sated
without you.

912
01:28:52,358 --> 01:28:56,278
Remember how once we were?

913
01:28:56,320 --> 01:29:00,658
A moment. Remember?

914
01:29:04,703 --> 01:29:09,458
I abhor you.

915
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:12,211
You are false!

916
01:29:13,128 --> 01:29:17,716
So you wish me to prove
my enmity as well?

917
01:29:17,758 --> 01:29:21,178
I will leave you three nights.

918
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:23,389
Tonight was the first.

919
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:26,267
Tonight you denied yourself,

920
01:29:26,308 --> 01:29:28,686
and thereby, you suffer me

921
01:29:28,727 --> 01:29:32,147
to vanish up the lives
of those you love.

922
01:29:32,189 --> 01:29:33,732
Denied myself?

923
01:29:33,774 --> 01:29:35,609
You revel in my torture.

924
01:29:35,651 --> 01:29:40,823
Upon the third night,
you will submit,

925
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:43,826
or he you call your husband

926
01:29:43,867 --> 01:29:46,870
shall perish by my hand.

927
01:29:46,912 --> 01:29:48,247
No.

928
01:29:48,289 --> 01:29:51,041
Till you bid me come

929
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:56,046
shall you watch the world
become as naught.

930
01:29:56,088 --> 01:29:57,590
No!

931
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:42,801
I ain't never seen the like.

932
01:30:42,843 --> 01:30:45,429
It's been a-spreading faster
than wildfire since yestermorn.

933
01:30:45,471 --> 01:30:47,598
We simply cannot admit any more.

934
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:49,725
The contraction rate
is too high.

935
01:30:49,767 --> 01:30:51,852
I've entreated the burgomaster
for a quarantine.

936
01:30:51,894 --> 01:30:54,480
-The city must be shut up.
-It ain't Christian.

937
01:30:54,521 --> 01:30:55,981
We can find rooms, sir.

938
01:30:56,023 --> 01:30:58,442
The day of judgment's
a-coming, sir. Take pity.

939
01:30:58,484 --> 01:31:02,154
We must remain calm
in the face of this plague.

940
01:31:04,657 --> 01:31:08,661
A shadow pressing.

941
01:31:08,702 --> 01:31:11,455
My body sinking.

942
01:31:11,497 --> 01:31:13,248
Sinking.

943
01:31:16,293 --> 01:31:18,462
The smell of rancid meat.

944
01:31:20,589 --> 01:31:21,965
Suffocating.

945
01:31:24,009 --> 01:31:25,803
I...

946
01:31:25,844 --> 01:31:29,223
I feel so weak. I...

947
01:31:32,893 --> 01:31:36,438
I fear little Friedrich
is so strong,

948
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,733
so hungry he is eating me weary.

949
01:31:45,364 --> 01:31:47,783
May I... may I see the girls?

950
01:31:50,369 --> 01:31:52,329
I must assure them...

951
01:31:54,873 --> 01:31:57,459
Everything will be well,
my darling.

952
01:31:57,501 --> 01:32:00,295
Everything shall be just fine.

953
01:32:01,338 --> 01:32:03,590
I don't know myself.

954
01:32:07,344 --> 01:32:10,514
Ellen, tell me,

955
01:32:10,556 --> 01:32:14,059
what is this
insufferable darkness?

956
01:32:14,101 --> 01:32:15,352
I...

957
01:32:27,406 --> 01:32:29,366
Herr Harding, you must see me.

958
01:32:29,408 --> 01:32:30,659
There is something.

959
01:32:30,701 --> 01:32:32,911
The shadow,
an infernal creature.

960
01:32:32,953 --> 01:32:34,538
-Ellen.
-Please!

961
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:35,914
These are no troubled nerves.

962
01:32:35,956 --> 01:32:38,500
It is as Professor Franz
described-- a demon.

963
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:42,463
Frau Hutter, forgive me,
but I need you and Thomas--

964
01:32:42,504 --> 01:32:44,631
both of you-- to return home.

965
01:32:44,673 --> 01:32:46,258
What?

966
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:48,218
It's for your own sake.

967
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:49,636
Please.

968
01:32:49,678 --> 01:32:51,513
Have pity.
Thomas is very poorly.

969
01:32:51,555 --> 01:32:53,390
I know not what I...

970
01:32:53,432 --> 01:32:55,893
I shall pray for Tom.

971
01:32:56,935 --> 01:32:59,438
-You know I love you both.
-What of Anna?

972
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:01,565
Did you not see her?

973
01:33:01,607 --> 01:33:02,900
It's none of your concern.

974
01:33:02,941 --> 01:33:04,818
Friedrich,
you must listen to me.

975
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:06,904
We're all in
the most grave danger.

976
01:33:06,945 --> 01:33:08,781
I throw myself at your feet!

977
01:33:08,822 --> 01:33:10,783
Frau Hutter, please!

978
01:33:14,453 --> 01:33:16,830
Why do you hate me?

979
01:33:19,917 --> 01:33:23,420
How dare you speak to me
in that marked manner?

980
01:33:23,462 --> 01:33:25,380
You have never liked me. Never.

981
01:33:25,422 --> 01:33:26,924
Know your place, madam.

982
01:33:26,965 --> 01:33:29,927
I will not stand by and pretend
at your superiority.

983
01:33:29,968 --> 01:33:31,345
I refuse to exchange

984
01:33:31,386 --> 01:33:33,096
-reproaches with you.
-Why can you not hear me?

985
01:33:33,138 --> 01:33:34,598
Listen to me, please!

986
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:36,308
I have done everything
in my power

987
01:33:36,350 --> 01:33:38,393
to be kind to you
in these long months.

988
01:33:38,435 --> 01:33:39,937
Tied me up.

989
01:33:43,357 --> 01:33:48,237
Find the dignity to display
the respect to your caretaker.

990
01:33:48,278 --> 01:33:51,073
How can you be so stupid
and cruel?

991
01:33:52,908 --> 01:33:55,994
Hartmann will call you a coach.

992
01:33:56,036 --> 01:33:59,164
My expense, of course.

993
01:33:59,832 --> 01:34:02,793
And for your husband's sake,
I pray you learn

994
01:34:02,835 --> 01:34:04,878
to conduct yourself
with more deference.

995
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,964
Anna is going to die.

996
01:34:07,005 --> 01:34:09,007
You are going to die!

997
01:34:09,049 --> 01:34:12,344
We're all going to die!

998
01:34:13,345 --> 01:34:15,889
Why did you not tell me
of this before?

999
01:34:15,931 --> 01:34:17,140
I am a fool.

1000
01:34:17,182 --> 01:34:18,600
Of course it is Herr Knock.

1001
01:34:18,642 --> 01:34:20,894
His obsessive consumption
of living creatures--

1002
01:34:20,936 --> 01:34:22,312
it must be him.

1003
01:34:22,354 --> 01:34:24,690
He is not Nosferatu.

1004
01:34:24,731 --> 01:34:26,817
But he must be found,

1005
01:34:26,859 --> 01:34:30,863
for he has made compact
with this shadow.

1006
01:34:37,828 --> 01:34:39,955
Search everything.

1007
01:34:59,975 --> 01:35:01,935
Pull up the rug.

1008
01:35:03,604 --> 01:35:05,564
Solomonari.

1009
01:35:07,733 --> 01:35:11,236
And their codex of secrets.

1010
01:35:16,825 --> 01:35:20,370
<i>Then I stood
on the sand by the sea.</i>

1011
01:35:20,412 --> 01:35:24,541
<i>And I saw a beast
rising out of the sea.</i>

1012
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:27,169
<i>And the serpent gave
the beast authority...</i>

1013
01:35:28,587 --> 01:35:32,049
<i>...to speak of great names
in blasphemy.</i>

1014
01:35:33,508 --> 01:35:35,928
<i>And the beast had
the form of a leopard,</i>

1015
01:35:35,969 --> 01:35:40,557
<i>the feet of a bear,
the mouth of a lion!</i>

1016
01:35:40,599 --> 01:35:43,769
<i>A beast with seven heads
and ten horns!</i>

1017
01:35:43,810 --> 01:35:46,104
<i>On each horn a crown,</i>

1018
01:35:46,146 --> 01:35:48,899
<i>on each head
a blasphemous name...</i>

1019
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:02,079
Our somnambulist and her husband

1020
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:03,455
are in incomparable danger.

1021
01:36:03,497 --> 01:36:04,998
I must see them.

1022
01:36:05,707 --> 01:36:08,085
I sent them home.

1023
01:36:08,126 --> 01:36:10,796
How can this perversion
be killed?

1024
01:36:10,837 --> 01:36:12,339
I do not know.
You sent them home?

1025
01:36:12,381 --> 01:36:13,882
-What?
-You sent them home?

1026
01:36:13,924 --> 01:36:15,425
No, not that. Yes, I did.

1027
01:36:15,467 --> 01:36:16,677
You don't know?

1028
01:36:16,718 --> 01:36:17,970
Precisely. Correct.

1029
01:36:18,011 --> 01:36:19,262
I do not know.

1030
01:36:19,304 --> 01:36:22,474
I have never encountered
Nosferatu firsthand.

1031
01:36:24,142 --> 01:36:26,103
He doesn't know.

1032
01:36:26,645 --> 01:36:29,773
All your fine lectures
are mere regurgitations

1033
01:36:29,815 --> 01:36:31,775
from bloody books!

1034
01:36:31,817 --> 01:36:34,111
The means of repelling
and destroying

1035
01:36:34,152 --> 01:36:36,405
vary greatly
from region to region.

1036
01:36:36,446 --> 01:36:38,865
Their efficacy
is plainly unknown.

1037
01:36:38,907 --> 01:36:41,284
Yet there is one invariable fact

1038
01:36:41,326 --> 01:36:43,453
-that interests me most.
-Go on.

1039
01:36:43,495 --> 01:36:47,457
In every account,
the Nosferatu must return

1040
01:36:47,499 --> 01:36:50,627
to the earth
wherein it was buried

1041
01:36:50,669 --> 01:36:53,046
by first crow of cock.

1042
01:36:53,088 --> 01:36:56,299
It must sleep
in its grave by day.

1043
01:36:56,341 --> 01:36:57,968
What happens if it does not?

1044
01:36:58,010 --> 01:37:00,262
That, my dear Sievers,
is the question.

1045
01:37:00,303 --> 01:37:04,474
Oh, God.

1046
01:37:04,516 --> 01:37:07,144
My God.

1047
01:37:07,185 --> 01:37:10,147
I am shattering.

1048
01:37:10,188 --> 01:37:12,649
I'm breaking apart. Get out.

1049
01:37:12,691 --> 01:37:14,359
Har-Harding.
-Take your leave at once.

1050
01:37:14,401 --> 01:37:15,694
Both of you!

1051
01:37:15,736 --> 01:37:17,446
Friedrich, please,
we do not wish to...

1052
01:37:17,487 --> 01:37:21,158
Can't you see there's a bloody
real plague, gentlemen?

1053
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:24,161
A real epidemic that is
really killing real people.

1054
01:37:24,202 --> 01:37:25,954
-Damn you, Harding!
-Oh, the pair of you!

1055
01:37:25,996 --> 01:37:27,748
I'm sorry, Sievers. I'm sorry.

1056
01:37:27,789 --> 01:37:29,499
Frau Hutter is mad

1057
01:37:29,541 --> 01:37:31,334
and should have been
locked up long ago.

1058
01:37:31,376 --> 01:37:33,628
My Anna...

1059
01:37:33,670 --> 01:37:35,547
was bitten by vermin.

1060
01:37:35,589 --> 01:37:38,175
Rats! No more.

1061
01:37:39,051 --> 01:37:41,344
Tomorrow,
we are leaving Wisburg.

1062
01:37:41,386 --> 01:37:43,388
But the quarantine-- tomorrow,
we close off the city.

1063
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:46,683
I'm not gonna let
your vain madness kill my wife.

1064
01:37:46,725 --> 01:37:50,312
The night demon has supped
of your good wife's blood

1065
01:37:50,353 --> 01:37:52,314
and shall return for the rest.

1066
01:37:56,026 --> 01:37:57,736
Leave.

1067
01:38:26,765 --> 01:38:29,226
Oh, Thomas.

1068
01:38:30,769 --> 01:38:32,771
Ellen, my love.

1069
01:38:36,775 --> 01:38:38,610
We must go.

1070
01:38:38,652 --> 01:38:40,362
We must flee the city.

1071
01:38:41,613 --> 01:38:43,490
You're in danger.

1072
01:38:43,532 --> 01:38:45,200
-You knew...
-We cannot run.

1073
01:38:45,242 --> 01:38:46,576
No, we must.

1074
01:38:46,618 --> 01:38:48,745
There is something
I must tell you.

1075
01:38:48,787 --> 01:38:51,540
Something so loathsome, so base.

1076
01:38:51,581 --> 01:38:54,000
Nothing you can say
will shake me,

1077
01:38:54,042 --> 01:38:55,919
for there is a devil
in this world,

1078
01:38:55,961 --> 01:38:58,338
and I have met him, and he...

1079
01:38:59,422 --> 01:39:01,633
I cannot speak it. He...

1080
01:39:02,592 --> 01:39:06,138
He is come to Wisburg for you.

1081
01:39:06,179 --> 01:39:08,598
I know.

1082
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:10,767
What?

1083
01:39:10,809 --> 01:39:12,978
I know him.

1084
01:39:13,019 --> 01:39:14,813
Know him?

1085
01:39:16,064 --> 01:39:18,400
I've brought this evil upon us.

1086
01:39:26,533 --> 01:39:28,994
I have never shared my...

1087
01:39:29,035 --> 01:39:31,413
secret with any soul.

1088
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:36,751
I sought company.

1089
01:39:36,793 --> 01:39:38,879
I sought...

1090
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:41,840
tenderness, and I called out.

1091
01:39:41,882 --> 01:39:44,134
-What do you mean by this?
-At first, it was sweet.

1092
01:39:44,176 --> 01:39:46,511
-I had never known such bliss.
-Ellen.

1093
01:39:46,553 --> 01:39:48,138
Yet it turned to torture.

1094
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:49,306
It would kill me.

1095
01:39:49,347 --> 01:39:51,474
But, Thomas...

1096
01:39:51,516 --> 01:39:55,478
it was you that gave me the
courage to be free of my shame.

1097
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,813
You.

1098
01:39:56,855 --> 01:39:58,815
What are you telling me?

1099
01:39:58,857 --> 01:40:00,317
Don't you understand?

1100
01:40:00,358 --> 01:40:02,360
Pray, help me to.

1101
01:40:02,402 --> 01:40:04,988
He is my shame.
He is my melancholy.

1102
01:40:05,030 --> 01:40:07,824
He took me as his lover then,
and now he has come back.

1103
01:40:07,866 --> 01:40:10,619
He has discovered our marriage
and has come back.

1104
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:11,828
Impossible.

1105
01:40:11,870 --> 01:40:13,288
He stalks me in my dreams.

1106
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:15,749
All my sleeping thoughts
are of him every night.

1107
01:40:15,790 --> 01:40:17,250
-Ellen.
-Don't touch me!

1108
01:40:17,292 --> 01:40:19,377
I am not to be touched.

1109
01:40:35,185 --> 01:40:37,479
You stopped your letters to me.

1110
01:40:38,521 --> 01:40:39,689
What?

1111
01:40:39,731 --> 01:40:41,441
You promised to write to me
every day.

1112
01:40:41,483 --> 01:40:43,693
Did not you think of me
in that castle?

1113
01:40:43,735 --> 01:40:45,153
I did. I...

1114
01:40:45,195 --> 01:40:46,780
Lies.

1115
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,282
After what you have
just confessed, how...

1116
01:40:49,324 --> 01:40:51,159
He told me about you.

1117
01:40:51,201 --> 01:40:53,870
He told me how foolish you were.

1118
01:40:53,912 --> 01:40:55,705
How fearful.

1119
01:40:55,747 --> 01:40:57,499
How like a child.

1120
01:40:57,540 --> 01:41:00,502
How you fell into his arms
as a swooning lily of a woman.

1121
01:41:00,543 --> 01:41:01,670
Ellen.

1122
01:41:01,711 --> 01:41:03,505
He told me how you sold me
to him for gold.

1123
01:41:03,546 --> 01:41:05,382
-No, I... -Our love was
supposed to be sacred!

1124
01:41:05,423 --> 01:41:07,425
-Ellen, please.
-You never listen!

1125
01:41:07,467 --> 01:41:08,885
Well, where is it?

1126
01:41:08,927 --> 01:41:11,221
Your money?
Your promotion? Your house?

1127
01:41:11,263 --> 01:41:14,349
Where is that
which is so precious to you?

1128
01:41:14,391 --> 01:41:16,476
Have you paid back kind Harding
your debt?

1129
01:41:16,518 --> 01:41:19,229
Have you repaid him with this
plague that infects his wife?

1130
01:41:19,271 --> 01:41:21,731
I left for us, for our future.

1131
01:41:21,773 --> 01:41:23,984
For what? For what?
For these things!

1132
01:41:24,025 --> 01:41:25,735
-For you!
-It doesn't matter!

1133
01:41:25,777 --> 01:41:26,861
It doesn't matt...

1134
01:41:26,903 --> 01:41:28,280
Can't you see?

1135
01:41:28,321 --> 01:41:30,282
We should never have married.

1136
01:41:30,323 --> 01:41:33,159
We're already dead!

1137
01:41:39,291 --> 01:41:42,794
Ellen, please.

1138
01:42:03,606 --> 01:42:05,442
Ellen!

1139
01:42:09,654 --> 01:42:11,781
I-I shall send for Dr. Sievers.

1140
01:42:11,823 --> 01:42:13,533
No!

1141
01:42:13,575 --> 01:42:15,952
No! Please, please.

1142
01:42:15,994 --> 01:42:17,537
I'll be good.

1143
01:42:17,579 --> 01:42:20,332
I'll be good.
I promise. I promise.

1144
01:42:32,302 --> 01:42:34,971
You could never please me
as he could.

1145
01:42:39,351 --> 01:42:41,686
Yes! Take me!

1146
01:42:43,146 --> 01:42:45,315
Please.

1147
01:42:45,357 --> 01:42:47,400
Please!

1148
01:42:48,276 --> 01:42:49,736
Yes!

1149
01:42:56,910 --> 01:42:58,995
Kiss me.

1150
01:42:59,037 --> 01:43:01,498
Kiss my heart. My heart.

1151
01:43:11,591 --> 01:43:14,511
Let him see.
Let him see our love.

1152
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:23,353
Without you,
I will become a demon.

1153
01:43:23,395 --> 01:43:26,106
Ellen. Ellen! Ellen!

1154
01:43:26,147 --> 01:43:28,274
Ellen, it's me. Ellen.

1155
01:43:28,316 --> 01:43:31,236
Ellen, I love you. I love you.

1156
01:43:31,277 --> 01:43:32,862
You're safe with me.

1157
01:43:32,904 --> 01:43:34,614
It's me. It's me.

1158
01:43:38,201 --> 01:43:39,911
Keep away from me.
I am unclean.

1159
01:43:39,953 --> 01:43:41,538
Never.

1160
01:43:44,541 --> 01:43:47,502
He will murder you
if I do not go to him.

1161
01:43:47,544 --> 01:43:50,380
We will be torn apart,
and the world will be despair.

1162
01:43:50,422 --> 01:43:51,881
No.

1163
01:43:51,923 --> 01:43:53,383
I'll kill him.

1164
01:43:53,425 --> 01:43:55,677
Kill him I will.

1165
01:43:55,718 --> 01:43:57,929
He shall never harm you again.

1166
01:43:58,930 --> 01:44:00,765
Never.

1167
01:44:02,475 --> 01:44:04,561
At last.

1168
01:44:13,319 --> 01:44:15,613
<i>And lo, the maiden fair</i>

1169
01:44:15,655 --> 01:44:18,741
<i>did offer up her love
unto the beast</i>

1170
01:44:18,783 --> 01:44:21,578
<i>and with him lay
in close embrace</i>

1171
01:44:21,619 --> 01:44:23,746
<i>until the first cock crow.</i>

1172
01:44:23,788 --> 01:44:28,042
<i>Her willing sacrifice
thus broke the curse</i>

1173
01:44:28,084 --> 01:44:31,963
<i>and freed them from
the plague of Nosferatu.</i>

1174
01:44:39,637 --> 01:44:42,182
She is the way.

1175
01:44:49,564 --> 01:44:52,775
Papa! Papa!

1176
01:44:52,817 --> 01:44:54,694
Friedrich. Friedrich!

1177
01:44:58,239 --> 01:44:59,741
Friedrich, wake up.

1178
01:46:21,531 --> 01:46:25,702
I can weep no longer, for
I have no more tears to shed.

1179
01:46:26,744 --> 01:46:28,538
We must speak with him.

1180
01:46:28,580 --> 01:46:31,499
Just a moment longer.
His grief is too great.

1181
01:46:31,541 --> 01:46:33,251
May I?

1182
01:46:35,253 --> 01:46:37,213
More will be taken.

1183
01:46:37,255 --> 01:46:39,716
-She was with child.
-I know.

1184
01:46:41,551 --> 01:46:43,886
The grim reaper wields
his heavy scythe

1185
01:46:43,928 --> 01:46:46,723
with every change of wind.

1186
01:46:46,764 --> 01:46:48,558
Professor,
I must speak with you.

1187
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,018
And I would speak with you.

1188
01:46:50,059 --> 01:46:54,522
Take that blackguard
from this place!

1189
01:46:54,564 --> 01:46:56,524
-Your diseased mind...
-Please. Please.

1190
01:46:56,566 --> 01:46:57,859
...has brought
all of this outrage!

1191
01:46:57,900 --> 01:46:59,569
-Stop this.
-Stop, please. It is my fault.

1192
01:46:59,611 --> 01:47:01,738
This moment doesn't
concern you, Thomas.

1193
01:47:01,779 --> 01:47:03,740
-Your very presence... -Your
horror has rent our hearts,

1194
01:47:03,781 --> 01:47:05,700
-but you must hear us.
-...does me wrong!

1195
01:47:05,742 --> 01:47:09,746
Friedrich,
these nightmares do exist!

1196
01:47:09,787 --> 01:47:11,748
They exist.

1197
01:47:17,253 --> 01:47:19,547
And yet he shows no sign
of the blood plague.

1198
01:47:19,589 --> 01:47:21,007
The good sisters sought
to nurse me

1199
01:47:21,049 --> 01:47:22,675
back to health
with their prayer,

1200
01:47:22,717 --> 01:47:25,595
yet I fear I'm not free
of his spell.

1201
01:47:25,637 --> 01:47:27,972
Trust in God and your strength.

1202
01:47:28,014 --> 01:47:31,017
The monster left you to
the wolves, yet you prevailed.

1203
01:47:31,059 --> 01:47:33,019
Harding.

1204
01:47:33,061 --> 01:47:35,772
Forgive me.
I'm not myself. I...

1205
01:47:37,315 --> 01:47:39,776
Please forgive me, all of you.

1206
01:47:39,817 --> 01:47:43,279
My reason could not accept...
accept...

1207
01:47:43,321 --> 01:47:44,781
Strength, man. Strength.

1208
01:47:44,822 --> 01:47:47,575
Orlok has kept his coffin
within Grunewald Manor?

1209
01:47:47,617 --> 01:47:49,452
-Assuredly.
-Under our very noses.

1210
01:47:49,494 --> 01:47:50,953
Tonight, we destroy the beast.

1211
01:47:50,995 --> 01:47:53,039
-Let me come with you.
-No, of course not, Ellen.

1212
01:47:53,081 --> 01:47:54,749
You must be kept safe away.

1213
01:47:54,791 --> 01:47:57,377
We shall meet at Harding's
and depart for the manor.

1214
01:47:57,418 --> 01:47:59,087
Please. The readiness is all.

1215
01:47:59,128 --> 01:48:02,465
We shall sanctify the earth
wherein he is buried

1216
01:48:02,507 --> 01:48:04,634
and destroy the sarcophagus.

1217
01:48:04,676 --> 01:48:07,845
Then he can have no sanctuary
at cock crow.

1218
01:48:07,887 --> 01:48:09,305
And when we uncover the body?

1219
01:48:09,347 --> 01:48:13,559
I will drive a spike
of cold iron through him.

1220
01:48:13,601 --> 01:48:16,354
-What if it does not work?
-It must.

1221
01:48:18,898 --> 01:48:21,693
Professor, allow me to walk you
to your door.

1222
01:48:27,198 --> 01:48:30,660
I know...
it must be me, Professor.

1223
01:48:30,702 --> 01:48:34,163
I am but an able tourist
in this occult world.

1224
01:48:34,205 --> 01:48:36,332
You were born to it.

1225
01:48:36,374 --> 01:48:38,000
It is a rare gift.

1226
01:48:38,042 --> 01:48:40,712
His pull to me is so powerful,

1227
01:48:40,753 --> 01:48:42,630
so terrible,

1228
01:48:42,672 --> 01:48:45,425
yet my spirit cannot
be evil as his.

1229
01:48:46,008 --> 01:48:49,887
We must know evil
to be able to destroy it.

1230
01:48:49,929 --> 01:48:52,348
We must discover it
within ourselves.

1231
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:55,977
And when we have, we must
crucify the evil within us,

1232
01:48:56,018 --> 01:48:57,478
or there is no salvation.

1233
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:59,105
I need no salvation.

1234
01:48:59,147 --> 01:49:01,858
My entire life, I have done
no ill but heed my nature.

1235
01:49:01,899 --> 01:49:04,235
Then hearken to it.

1236
01:49:04,277 --> 01:49:09,782
I fear Nosferatu is impervious
to any of our iron stakes.

1237
01:49:10,491 --> 01:49:13,369
I'm convinced only you

1238
01:49:13,411 --> 01:49:16,497
have the faculty to redeem us.

1239
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:19,876
Ellen, let us make haste.

1240
01:49:27,759 --> 01:49:29,385
In heathen times,

1241
01:49:29,427 --> 01:49:33,222
you might have been
a great priestess of Isis.

1242
01:49:33,264 --> 01:49:37,518
Yet, in this strange
and modern world,

1243
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:39,812
your purpose is
of greater worth.

1244
01:49:40,563 --> 01:49:43,608
You are our salvation.

1245
01:49:43,649 --> 01:49:45,401
Thank you.

1246
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:51,407
I will keep your husband
at bay tonight.

1247
01:49:51,449 --> 01:49:53,034
Go now. Go home.

1248
01:49:53,075 --> 01:49:56,954
Attend him that he is sturdy
for this false hunt.

1249
01:50:24,899 --> 01:50:27,443
You will put an end
to all of this?

1250
01:50:31,489 --> 01:50:34,784
Promise you shan't return to me
till he is no more.

1251
01:50:34,826 --> 01:50:38,079
-Promise me you won't return.
-I promise.

1252
01:50:39,288 --> 01:50:42,708
He does not have power
over you, Thomas.

1253
01:50:42,750 --> 01:50:45,711
I place my utter faith in you.

1254
01:50:45,753 --> 01:50:47,380
I love you.

1255
01:50:47,421 --> 01:50:49,090
Fear not.

1256
01:51:08,025 --> 01:51:10,069
Goodbye.

1257
01:51:11,612 --> 01:51:12,864
He is not here?

1258
01:51:12,905 --> 01:51:14,490
No, Mr. Harding
has departed, sir.

1259
01:51:14,532 --> 01:51:15,908
Where could he have gone?

1260
01:51:15,950 --> 01:51:17,493
He has a heavy grief.

1261
01:51:17,535 --> 01:51:19,745
We shall wait for him.

1262
01:51:19,787 --> 01:51:21,581
There's time yet till sundown.

1263
01:51:21,622 --> 01:51:24,333
No, we must find him.

1264
01:51:26,878 --> 01:51:29,338
He is unwell, Sievers.
I fear for him.

1265
01:51:31,007 --> 01:51:33,384
-Harding!
-Harding!

1266
01:51:36,762 --> 01:51:39,015
Friedrich!

1267
01:51:59,410 --> 01:52:01,162
Clara.

1268
01:52:02,788 --> 01:52:04,957
Louise.

1269
01:52:08,586 --> 01:52:11,005
Oh, my girls.

1270
01:52:17,428 --> 01:52:19,430
Anna.

1271
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:24,101
Your bed is so dark.

1272
01:52:26,395 --> 01:52:28,731
So small.

1273
01:52:32,568 --> 01:52:34,612
Anna, my love.

1274
01:52:37,239 --> 01:52:39,033
Our son.

1275
01:52:41,452 --> 01:52:43,537
Our little son.

1276
01:52:46,457 --> 01:52:48,167
Forgive me.

1277
01:52:50,336 --> 01:52:52,713
I shall never sleep again.

1278
01:52:54,507 --> 01:52:57,009
Never.

1279
01:53:02,306 --> 01:53:06,477
Let this, your tender embrace,

1280
01:53:06,519 --> 01:53:09,271
keep me now in bliss,

1281
01:53:09,313 --> 01:53:13,025
away from everlasting sleep.

1282
01:53:25,413 --> 01:53:27,123
Friedrich!

1283
01:53:36,048 --> 01:53:38,134
Oh, God.

1284
01:53:41,303 --> 01:53:43,681
We are too late.

1285
01:53:43,723 --> 01:53:47,727
We must set fire
to their infected bodies.

1286
01:53:47,768 --> 01:53:49,854
Our flames will sanctify them.

1287
01:53:49,895 --> 01:53:52,523
I cannot bear any more.

1288
01:53:53,315 --> 01:53:55,317
Please, we must onward.

1289
01:53:55,359 --> 01:53:58,070
But Orlok-- will he not
already have risen?

1290
01:53:58,112 --> 01:53:59,572
Should we not return
to our homes?

1291
01:53:59,613 --> 01:54:01,449
No, I will not wait
till morning.

1292
01:54:01,490 --> 01:54:02,992
Very wise, young Thomas.

1293
01:54:03,034 --> 01:54:06,162
I feel his hold
upon me this night.

1294
01:54:07,455 --> 01:54:09,749
May God have mercy
on their souls.

1295
01:54:11,042 --> 01:54:12,710
<i>In the Name of Jehovah,</i>

1296
01:54:12,752 --> 01:54:15,463
<i>and by the power and dignity
of these three Names,</i>

1297
01:54:15,504 --> 01:54:18,340
<i>Tetragrammaton,
Anexhexeton, Primematum,</i>

1298
01:54:18,382 --> 01:54:22,762
<i>cast thee, O thou disobedient
Spirit Nosferatu,</i>

1299
01:54:22,803 --> 01:54:24,263
<i>into the Lake of Fire,</i>

1300
01:54:24,305 --> 01:54:26,390
<i>there to remain
until the Day of Doom</i>

1301
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:29,351
<i>and not to be remembered
before the face of God</i>

1302
01:54:29,393 --> 01:54:32,313
<i>who shall come to judge
the quick and the dead</i>

1303
01:54:32,354 --> 01:54:34,440
<i>and the world with fire.</i>

1304
01:55:01,092 --> 01:55:02,551
There is a chapel
beyond the courtyard.

1305
01:55:02,593 --> 01:55:04,678
Make haste, Thomas!

1306
01:55:12,186 --> 01:55:14,647
I am ready.

1307
01:55:14,688 --> 01:55:18,275
I bid you, come to me.

1308
01:55:24,073 --> 01:55:26,117
There he lies.

1309
01:55:34,125 --> 01:55:35,126
Oh, God.

1310
01:55:38,295 --> 01:55:39,964
Go forward, Thomas.

1311
01:55:40,005 --> 01:55:42,383
Set free the demon's body.

1312
01:56:17,168 --> 01:56:18,836
Thomas, no!

1313
01:56:18,878 --> 01:56:21,463
Herr Knock.

1314
01:56:21,505 --> 01:56:23,424
I...

1315
01:56:23,465 --> 01:56:26,927
relinquished him my soul.

1316
01:56:28,888 --> 01:56:34,685
I should have been
the Prince of Rats, immortal.

1317
01:56:36,645 --> 01:56:41,483
But he cares only
for his pretty bride,

1318
01:56:41,525 --> 01:56:44,653
-and she is his.
-Monstrous.

1319
01:56:44,695 --> 01:56:46,947
Strike again.

1320
01:56:46,989 --> 01:56:49,992
I am blasphemy.

1321
01:56:50,034 --> 01:56:52,786
Die, you accursed
mis-birth of hell!

1322
01:56:52,828 --> 01:56:54,997
Set fire to it all.

1323
01:56:55,039 --> 01:56:56,916
Damn it, man,
he has gone to my wife.

1324
01:56:56,957 --> 01:56:58,167
We must burn it.

1325
01:56:58,209 --> 01:57:00,211
We must destroy
all his habitation.

1326
01:57:00,252 --> 01:57:01,170
No sanctuary.

1327
01:57:01,212 --> 01:57:02,588
No, there is no time to be lost.

1328
01:57:02,630 --> 01:57:04,965
-He pursues Ellen.
-It must be her!

1329
01:57:05,007 --> 01:57:07,384
He cannot resist her blood!

1330
01:57:07,426 --> 01:57:09,303
You are a madman.

1331
01:57:09,345 --> 01:57:11,347
You knew Orlok
would not be here.

1332
01:57:11,388 --> 01:57:12,932
You knew it this afternoon.

1333
01:57:12,973 --> 01:57:14,183
Your wife wills it.

1334
01:57:14,225 --> 01:57:15,684
This is not moral!

1335
01:57:15,726 --> 01:57:19,521
God is beyond our morals!

1336
01:57:19,563 --> 01:57:22,399
In vain! In vain!
You run in vain!

1337
01:57:22,441 --> 01:57:25,903
You cannot outrun her destiny!

1338
01:57:25,945 --> 01:57:31,450
Her dark bond with the beast
shall redeem us all,

1339
01:57:31,492 --> 01:57:36,205
for when the sun's pure light
shall break upon the dawn,

1340
01:57:36,247 --> 01:57:37,873
redemption!

1341
01:57:39,416 --> 01:57:41,919
The plague shall be lifted!

1342
01:57:43,879 --> 01:57:46,507
Redemption!

1343
01:59:26,023 --> 01:59:28,359
I do.

1344
01:59:38,744 --> 01:59:40,496
Yes.

1345
02:02:23,033 --> 02:02:24,576
More.

1346
02:02:25,410 --> 02:02:27,204
More.

1347
02:03:56,043 --> 02:03:57,878
Ellen.

1348
02:04:43,006 --> 02:04:45,133
Forgive us.

1349
02:04:47,886 --> 02:04:51,473
<i>And lo, the maiden fair</i>

1350
02:04:51,515 --> 02:04:56,144
<i>did offer up her love
unto the beast</i>

1351
02:04:56,186 --> 02:04:59,564
<i>and with him lay
in close embrace</i>

1352
02:04:59,606 --> 02:05:02,818
<i>until the first cock crow.</i>

1353
02:05:02,859 --> 02:05:07,197
<i>Her willing sacrifice
thus broke the curse</i>

1354
02:05:07,239 --> 02:05:11,702
<i>and freed them from
the plague of Nosferatu.</i>
