00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,298
Sorry about that. Back there.

720
00:56:38,568 --> 00:56:41,171
I guess I can't
hide this anymore.

721
00:56:52,848 --> 00:56:54,751
Why didn't you tell me?

722
00:56:55,685 --> 00:56:57,888
Didn't think it would
make any difference.

723
00:57:02,492 --> 00:57:04,158
All I know is that WICKED
must have put me

724
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,862
in that maze for a reason.

725
00:57:07,263 --> 00:57:08,129
Maybe it was literally

726
00:57:08,131 --> 00:57:09,564
just so they could tell
the difference

727
00:57:09,566 --> 00:57:12,736
between immunes like you
and people like me.

728
00:57:15,638 --> 00:57:17,841

still fix this, Newt.

00:57:19,376 --> 00:57:21,075
Okay? We can.

732
00:57:25,182 --> 00:57:26,883
Now he needs us.

733
00:57:28,017 --> 00:57:31,451
So if there is even
the slightest chance

734
00:57:31,453 --> 00:57:33,120
that we can save him,

735
00:57:33,122 --> 00:57:36,126
we can get him out of there,
then we have to take that.

736
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,731
No matter what the cost.

00:57:43,198 --> 00:57:44,767

745

you're going to save her.

one of them down

It's not about
giving up, Janson.

seriously think...

833
01:07:05,294 --> 01:07:07,060
Don't look at him.

834

Why are you looking at him?

835
01:07:08,863 --> 01:07:10,363
Look at me.

836
01:07:10,365 --> 01:07:12,467
He's not gonna help you.

837
01:07:15,138 --> 01:07:17,307
Now, we know you have Minho
in the building.

838
01:07:18,473 --> 01:07:19,475
Where?

839
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:23,109
He's with the others
in holding.

841
01:07:25,582 --> 01:07:27,283

01:07:28,684 --> 01:07:29,952
28.

843
01:07:32,053 --> 01:07:33,819
I can make that work.

No, you guys don't understand.

gonna come with us.

Well, I don't know.

849
01:07:46,033 --> 01:07:48,271
We don't necessarily need her.

850
01:07:48,937 --> 01:07:49,939
Right?

851
01:07:51,707 --> 01:07:53,807
Not all of her.

852
01:07:53,809 --> 01:07:56,075

It's your last chance.

You know, it's not like you
to shy away from a fight.

875
01:09:06,348 --> 01:09:08,948
And it's not like you
to go looking for one.

876
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:11,251
I just can't help but think
if I walk out that door...

877
01:09:11,253 --> 01:09:12,922
I'm never gonna see you again.

our necks out for strangers?

885
01:09:49,757 --> 01:09:51,993

getting her serum?

886
01:09:53,628 --> 01:09:55,430

888
01:09:59,767 --> 01:10:01,937
I didn't think
she'd still be alive.

889
01:10:04,673 --> 01:10:06,441

892
01:10:15,484 --> 01:10:17,620
But that was months ago.

893
01:10:22,357 --> 01:10:24,659
Thomas, that's not possible.

894
01:10:26,194 --> 01:10:28,594
She should have turned by now.

895
01:10:28,596 --> 01:10:30,330
There's no way she
could possibly still...

896
01:10:30,332 --> 01:10:31,934
All right, that's enough.

897
01:10:33,636 --> 01:10:34,837
You don't believe me?

898
01:10:35,637 --> 01:10:37,774
Do you really
expect me to?

899

1624
02:12:03,355 --> 02:12:06,689
So many have sacrificed
so much

1625
02:12:06,691 --> 02:12:08,560
to make this place possible.

1626
02:12:09,927 --> 02:12:11,430
Your friends

1627
02:12:12,931 --> 02:12:14,132
and your family.

who couldn't be here.

Here's to the friends we lost.

1630

This place is for you.
It's for all of us.

1631

But this,

1632

this is for them.

1633
02:12:34,419 --> 02:12:37,823
So, in your own time,
in your own way,

1634
02:12:39,391 --> 02:12:41,293
come make your peace.

1635
02:12:43,427 --> 02:12:45,728

Yeah.

1642
02:13:30,441 --> 02:13:33,178
You had this on you
while you were passed out.

1643
02:13:37,982 --> 02:13:40,386
Figured I'd keep it
safe for ya.

1644
02:13:44,056 --> 02:13:45,958
Thanks, Minho.

1645
02:13:47,959 --> 02:13:49,826

NEWT: <i>Dear Thomas...</i>

1648
02:14:48,052 --> 02:14:51,787
<i>This is the first letter
I can remember writing.</i>

1649
02:14:51,789 --> 02:14:55,558
<i>Obviously, I don't know if I
wrote any before the maze.</i>

1650
02:14:55,560 --> 02:15:00,862
<i>But even if it's not my first,
it's likely to be my last.</i>

1651
02:15:00,864 --> 02:15:03,635
<i>I want you to know
that I'm not scared.</i>

1652
02:15:04,569 --> 02:15:06,368
<i>Well, not of dying, anyway.</i>

1653
02:15:06,370 --> 02:15:09,304
<i>It's more forgetting.</i>

1654
02:15:09,306 --> 02:15:11,206
<i>It's losing myself
to this virus.</i>

1655
02:15:11,208 --> 02:15:13,278
<i>That's what scares me.</i>

1656
02:15:16,815 --> 02:15:19,782
<i>So every night I've been
saying their names out loud.</i>

1657
02:15:19,784 --> 02:15:21,084
<i>Alby...</i>

1658
02:15:21,086 --> 02:15:23,055
<i>Winston, Chuck.</i>

1659
02:15:24,588 --> 02:15:26,723
<i>And I just repeat them
over and over,</i>

1660
02:15:26,725 --> 02:15:29,091
<i>like a prayer,</i>

1661
02:15:29,093 --> 02:15:31,029
<i>and it all comes
flooding back.</i>

1662
02:15:34,399 --> 02:15:35,665
<i>Just the little things,
like the way</i>

1663
02:15:35,667 --> 02:15:36,832
<i>the sun used to
hit the Glade</i>

1664
02:15:36,834 --> 02:15:39,035
<i>at that perfect moment
right before</i>

1665
02:15:39,037 --> 02:15:41,437
<i>it slipped beneath the walls.</i>

1666
02:15:41,439 --> 02:15:45,075
<i>And I remember the taste
of Frypan's stew.</i>

1667
02:15:45,077 --> 02:15:47,445
<i>I never thought
I'd miss that stuff so much.</i>

1668
02:15:50,515 --> 02:15:52,648
<i>And I remember you.</i>

1669
02:15:52,650 --> 02:15:55,017
<i>I remember the first time you
came up in the Box.</i>

1670
02:15:55,019 --> 02:15:56,419
<i>Just a scared little Greenie</i>

1671
02:15:56,421 --> 02:15:58,557
<i>who couldn't even remember
his own name.</i>

1672
02:15:59,656 --> 02:16:01,424
<i>But from that moment
you ran into the maze,</i>

1673
02:16:01,426 --> 02:16:03,861
<i>I knew I would
follow you anywhere.</i>

1674
02:16:05,431 --> 02:16:06,999
<i>And I have.</i>

1675
02:16:08,934 --> 02:16:10,802
<i>We all have.</i>

1676
02:16:14,306 --> 02:16:16,505
<i>If I could do it
all over again, I would</i>

1677
02:16:16,507 --> 02:16:21,478
<i>and I wouldn't
change a thing.</i>

1678
02:16:21,480 --> 02:16:24,714
<i>And my hope for you</i>

1679
02:16:24,716 --> 02:16:26,683
<i>is that when you're looking
back years from now,</i>

1680
02:16:26,685 --> 02:16:28,986
<i>you'll be able
to say the same.</i>

1681

<i>The future's
in your hands now, Tommy.</i>

1682
02:16:35,492 --> 02:16:38,029
<i>And I know you'll find a way
to do what's right.</i>

1683
02:16:39,464 --> 02:16:41,033
<i>You always have.</i>

1684
02:16:43,068 --> 02:16:44,902
<i>Take care of everyone for me.</i>

1685
02:16:46,503 --> 02:16:48,473
<i>And take care of yourself.</i>

1686
02:16:50,341 --> 02:16:52,610
<i>You deserve to be happy.</i>

1687
02:16:56,013 --> 02:16:57,982
<i>Thank you for being my friend.</i>
