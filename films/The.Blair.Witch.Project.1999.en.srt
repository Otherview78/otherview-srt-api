1
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:01,127
It's already recording.

2
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,297
Okay, just...

3
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:04,967
-This is my home.
-You look a little blurry, man.

4
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:06,047
Let me zoom out on you.

5
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:07,967
-Okay.
-Okay.

6
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,257
Good morning.

7
00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:10,757
-Got it?
-Okay, I got you.

8
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:14,137
-This is my home.
-Okay.

9
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:17,187
Which I am leaving the comforts of
for the weekend

10
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:19,937
to explore the Blair Witch.

11
00:01:19,937 --> 00:01:22,277
Some essential reading,
How to Stay Alive in the Woods,

12
00:01:22,277 --> 00:01:24,127
'cause you never know
what's going to happen.

13
00:01:24,237 --> 00:01:25,817
And this is a very important book

14
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:29,367
because it has the article
about what happened at Coffin Rock.

15
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:30,827
-That looks pretty old.
-Yeah,

16
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:32,827
it's totally old.
And this is my field notebook.

17
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:36,667
-Hey, it's Mr. Punctuality.
-Hey.

18
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:39,917
-How the hell are you this morning?
-Tired.

19
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,667
So I got the CP up.

20
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,837
Good. That's important

21
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:46,297
'cause that's what we're shooting on.

22
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:48,837
No one knows I took it, but I got it.

23
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:53,007
All right, come on, into the house.
Come on, come on.

24
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:55,477
I can see you.

25
00:01:55,477 --> 00:01:58,147
I'm going to bump into shit.
I'm walking backwards now.

26
00:01:58,147 --> 00:02:00,477
Okay, we don't want to fuck up
the cameras before we leave.

27
00:02:00,477 --> 00:02:01,897
So, where's Mikey at?

28
00:02:01,897 --> 00:02:03,187
We have to go get him.

29
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:04,397
Okay.

30
00:02:04,397 --> 00:02:06,397
-We're supposed to get him at 8:30.
-Okay.

31
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:08,197
Which means we're already
going to be behind schedule,

32
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:10,447
-but it's important to have juice.
-That's cool.

33
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:13,497
I guess you're Mike.

34
00:02:13,907 --> 00:02:17,167
Here, wait... Stop, stop.

35
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:23,137
Don't we get to meet your mama?

36
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:28,877
See you later, Mom!

37
00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:30,387
How are you, Mike? It's nice to meet you.

38
00:02:30,387 --> 00:02:33,017
I'm tired, but I'm doing good.
I'm real excited about this.

39
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:34,217
-Thank you for the opportunity.
-I'm very glad.

40
00:02:34,217 --> 00:02:37,727
Well, thank you for getting
the equipment together.

41
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:39,557
We've got so much fucking battery power,

42
00:02:39,557 --> 00:02:43,317
we could fuel a small world country
for a month.

43
00:02:43,317 --> 00:02:46,897
We got rice, we got Mott's Fruit Punch.

44
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:48,857
Oatmeal raisin, baby.

45
00:02:48,857 --> 00:02:52,947
-Ultimate camp food.
-Marshmallows...

46
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:57,077
Feel how soft. Soft...

47
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,247
Hey, you weasel.

48
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:01,167
Marshmallows...

49
00:03:05,957 --> 00:03:07,837
Do you believe in ghosts?

50
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:11,217
Have you ever heard of the Blair Witch?

51
00:03:11,217 --> 00:03:14,387
It's... It actually
sounds kind of familiar.

52
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:17,217
My older sister went to Blair High School.

53
00:03:17,227 --> 00:03:21,097
The woods around Halloween time
is a creepy enough phenomenon.

54
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:23,017
-Just tell me a little bit more...
-I don't want to go cheesy.

55
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:25,187
I want to really avoid any cheese.

56
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:27,937
I want to present this
in as straightforward a way as possible,

57
00:03:27,937 --> 00:03:30,607
and I think the legend
is unsettling enough.

58
00:03:30,607 --> 00:03:36,417
You guys want to get
the ceremonial first slate?

59
00:03:36,737 --> 00:03:39,747
Absolutely.

60
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:44,457
Here he is, filling out our first slate
for our first shot.

61
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:48,167
Should we all, like, cut our fingers open
and bleed on it?

62
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:49,627
A little bloodletting on the slate?

63
00:03:49,627 --> 00:03:51,127
No, we'll save that for later.

64
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:54,177
Kiss it. Kiss the slate.

65
00:03:54,637 --> 00:03:56,097
It's the first slate.

66
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:58,347
First slate. Marked by my lipstick.

67
00:03:58,347 --> 00:04:00,977
Mikey, first slate. Kiss it. Good luck.

68
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:02,807
He licked it. God bless him.

69
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:05,807
You're not supposed to eat it.
We need that for the rest of the shoot.

70
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:09,687
This is Burkittsville, formerly Blair.

71
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:13,067
It is a small, quiet Maryland town,

72
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:16,407
much like a small, quiet town anywhere.

73
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:18,737
No more than 20 families
laid their roots here

74
00:04:18,737 --> 00:04:26,797
over 200 years ago, many of whom remain
either on this hill or in the town below.

75
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:31,507
There are an unusually high number
of children laid to rest here,

76
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:34,797
most of whom passed in the 1940s.

77
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:39,177
Yet, no one in the town seems to recall
anything unusual about this time.

78
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:41,177
To us, anyway.

79
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:46,687
Yet, legend tells a different story.
One whose evidence is all around us,

80
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:49,617
etched in stone.

81
00:04:54,857 --> 00:04:58,367
Well, we have shot the first scene.
The cemetery scene.

82
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:01,037
The opening is shot.

83
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:02,997
-We're doing a documentary.
-Yeah?

84
00:05:02,997 --> 00:05:05,867
About the Blair Witch.

85
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:07,327
-Have you heard of the Blair Witch?
-Oh, yeah.

86
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:09,707
That's an old, old, old story.

87
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:14,217
As I remember, Mr. Parr was an old hermit.

88
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:16,547
-Right.
-And he lived up on a mountain.

89
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:18,387
He had a place up there.

90
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:19,967
Been there for a long, long time.

91
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:22,387
-You've heard of the Blair Witch?
-Several times.

92
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:24,887
Several times?
And what was the first incident?

93
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:28,517
I've heard stories about her from people
and neighbors and stuff like that.

94
00:05:28,517 --> 00:05:31,727
But also I saw a documentary
on the Discovery Channel, or somewhere,

95
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:32,897
-once about her.
-Really?

96
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:35,487
About the ghosts and legends of Maryland.

97
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:38,027
Yeah, that's a story
my grandmother used to tell us all.

98
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:39,777
-Make us go to bed early.
-Really?

99
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:42,787
They say if you stay up after dark,
walk around the house too much,

100
00:05:42,787 --> 00:05:44,657
the Blair Witch will come and get you.

101
00:05:44,657 --> 00:05:46,457
Sort of in the winter, I guess,

102
00:05:46,457 --> 00:05:52,547
the fall or the winter of 1940, some of
the young kids started to disappear.

103
00:05:52,547 --> 00:05:55,917
Nobody knew anything
about why they were...

104
00:05:55,927 --> 00:05:57,377
Why they were disappearing.

105
00:05:57,387 --> 00:05:59,257
The creepiest...

106
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:01,597
-The creepiest story about her...
-That's kind of an omen, isn't it?

107
00:06:01,597 --> 00:06:05,477
...that I ever heard
was that two men were out hunting,

108
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:07,977
and they were camped near the cabin,
or something,

109
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:09,097
that she's supposed to haunt.

110
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:10,147
No, no!

111
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:12,107
And they disappeared
off the face of the Earth.

112
00:06:12,107 --> 00:06:13,187
-No.
-Really?

113
00:06:13,187 --> 00:06:15,277
Okay, it's all right, Ingrid.
I'm just telling a scary story,

114
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:17,607
-but it's not true.
-It's not true.

115
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:21,367
Finally, one day,
old Mr. Parr come down into the market

116
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:23,327
and said, "I'm finally finished."

117
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:24,487
And what did he mean by that?

118
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:26,577
I guess nobody knew at first,

119
00:06:26,577 --> 00:06:30,787
but the police
finally went up on the mountain

120
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:32,837
and they searched his house

121
00:06:32,837 --> 00:06:35,707
and they found the bodies
of seven kids from the area.

122
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:37,797
What he did is, he took the kids

123
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:41,467
down into the basement by twos
and he made one face into the corner.

124
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,637
Really?

125
00:06:42,637 --> 00:06:44,177
And then he would kill the other one.

126
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:46,767
And then when he was done with that,
he'd grab the one out of the corner

127
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:48,267
and kill that one, too.

128
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:49,847
And those were the seven kids
that were missing.

129
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:53,017
And then they brought them
out of the woods one at a time,

130
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:54,977
and it just was a terrible thing.

131
00:06:54,977 --> 00:06:56,647
Just tore the whole community up.

132
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:58,647
Said in court that
he couldn't take the eyes on him.

133
00:06:58,647 --> 00:07:00,237
He could...
He could feel the eyes watching him.

134
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:02,907
That's why he made them
face into the corner like that.

135
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:07,497
All my life, really, I've believed
in witches and ghosts and all that stuff.

136
00:07:07,497 --> 00:07:09,497
Do you believe that
there are some in this area?

137
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:10,577
Definitely.

138
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:12,787
-Do you believe in witchcraft?
-No.

139
00:07:12,787 --> 00:07:13,917
-No?
-No, sir.

140
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:15,297
Are you a religious man?

141
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:16,917
-Yep.
-All righty.

142
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,717
Pretty creepy stuff.

143
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:21,257
I believe there's something
happening with her.

144
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:24,007
And you think that it's possible
that she's still up there now?

145
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:25,637
-I don't go up there.
-You don't go up there?

146
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:27,427
Yeah, I believe enough not to go up there.

147
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:29,847
And they say that the woods
are all haunted up there

148
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:31,017
and stuff like that, but...

149
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,897
What do they say? How are they haunted?

150
00:07:32,897 --> 00:07:36,857
I don't... There really isn't many people
that say that it's haunted,

151
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,527
but there was this old woman,
Mary Brown, who used to...

152
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:43,357
-Mary Brown?
-Yeah, and she was kind of a crazy lady.

153
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:45,367
How was she seen by the community?

154
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:46,487
Crazy.

155
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:51,157
That's it. The American flag.
That's Mary's house.

156
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,247
I'm going to grab her and bring her out.

157
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:53,327
Why don't you take a look around

158
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:54,537
and see where the best light is, all right?

159
00:07:54,537 --> 00:07:56,927
Okay.

160
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:01,927
This is Mary's gate.

161
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:05,387
I'm not even sure how I pull this open.

162
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:08,427
'Cause something interesting happened to
you, actually, at one point in your life.

163
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:11,887
You had an encounter with the Blair Witch?

164
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:17,317
Yes. That is a really,
kind of, scary story.

165
00:08:17,317 --> 00:08:18,977
To, kind of, make ends meet,

166
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:23,067
my dad and I would go fishing
down by Tappy's Creek.

167
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:26,907
-Right.
-And, you know, it's in Burkittsville.

168
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:30,407
I was lying down on the leaves,
a pile of leaves,

169
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:33,407
kind of watching my pole
and looking up at the sky.

170
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:35,457
-Sure.
-And all of a sudden,

171
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:38,587
-I felt like something was near me.
-Right.

172
00:08:38,587 --> 00:08:41,087
You know, kind of an eerie feeling.

173
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,547
It was like a woman,

174
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:49,217
only on her arms and on her hands
and everything it was like hair.

175
00:08:49,217 --> 00:08:53,307
Like a real dark, almost black, hair.

176
00:08:53,307 --> 00:08:55,187
-Like a horse.
-Like fur?

177
00:08:55,187 --> 00:08:57,607
Yeah, like a fur. Like horse fur.

178
00:08:57,607 --> 00:09:00,527
-Then on her arms, she had a shawl...
-Right.

179
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:01,817
Wool shawl over her.

180
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:02,937
And she scared you?

181
00:09:02,947 --> 00:09:06,737
-She threatened you?
-And she didn't say anything,

182
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:10,577
but she just kept staring,
and then she opened up her shawl...

183
00:09:10,577 --> 00:09:11,617
And what was under there?

184
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:14,827
And under there was hair
on her body like a horse.

185
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:16,997
So she was hairy from head to toe?

186
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:20,037
Yeah, and her legs...

187
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:23,207
-And you could see she was a female.
-Right. How about her face?

188
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:26,427
It was just kind of, like, strange-looking.

189
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:29,547
Thank God, she's not in the film business.
l mean, can you imagine working with her?

190
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:32,637
She thinks she is in the film business.
She also says she's a ballerina.

191
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:34,137
-Get out.
-She says she's a historian

192
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:35,727
writing a book on American history...

193
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:37,517
-I heard that.
-...and that she's a scientist

194
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:39,267
who does research
at the Department of Energy.

195
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:40,567
I fucked up on Mary.

196
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,817
I'm checking my depth of field chart
to see how bad.

197
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:46,027
So you measured for meters? What?
We're not in Europe.

198
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:48,277
Yeah, the fucking lens
has meters on it, okay.

199
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:51,827
It also has our system.

200
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:55,337
No, it had meters on it. Look.

201
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:58,497
This is an American camera, though.

202
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,337
All those are meters.

203
00:10:00,337 --> 00:10:01,747
What about the brown ones?

204
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:02,957
The brown ones are feet.

205
00:10:02,957 --> 00:10:05,337
Yeah, the brown ones are on there, right?

206
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:07,837
Yeah, but the white ones are obvious.

207
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:09,587
But I thought
you've used this camera before, man.

208
00:10:09,597 --> 00:10:12,257
I've used it, like, once before.

209
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:15,387
How do we feel about today, guys?

210
00:10:15,387 --> 00:10:16,847
-I learned a lot, man.
-Yeah.

211
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:19,307
You learned a lot about Mary Brown?

212
00:10:19,307 --> 00:10:22,477
No, I learned a lot about, like, fucking...

213
00:10:22,477 --> 00:10:24,107
Sixteen?

214
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:27,737
Just shooting out here. Just shooting doc.

215
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:30,067
-We kicked some ass today.
-Cheers to you.

216
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:31,867
-Very good day.
-Excellent day.

217
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:33,527
Very good first day.

218
00:10:33,537 --> 00:10:35,867
Okay, we're going to do
an equipment check,

219
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:36,997
but I'm going to call my mom.

220
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:38,497
Okay, I've got a bag of Utz and a beer.

221
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:40,747
And we don't really need
to get that on film.

222
00:10:40,747 --> 00:10:42,917
So, I guess you're covered, then.

223
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,497
Could you just run it
for a couple of feet for me

224
00:10:44,507 --> 00:10:47,007
so we can check that it's okay?

225
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:48,377
Sure.

226
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:50,547
I just want to hear
if this mag is loaded properly,

227
00:10:50,547 --> 00:10:53,217
so we can shoot some stuff.

228
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:56,267
Okay, that's good. That's good.

229
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:58,887
-That's good, thank you.
-Okay.

230
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:01,647
Let's be relaxed 'cause we've got
a really, really long day tomorrow.

231
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:04,517
Today was cake compared to tomorrow.
We're going to do a lot of hiking.

232
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:05,777
We're going to have a lot
of weight on our backs.

233
00:11:05,777 --> 00:11:07,027
I'm preparing.

234
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:08,067
That's what we're preparing for.

235
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:12,407
Shut up, you smartass.
Pour me a shot, please.

236
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:14,237
-I'm freaking out.
-You can't do that.

237
00:11:14,237 --> 00:11:16,077
-You're the director.
-Yes, I... You know, at this point,

238
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:17,657
I fucking have to do that, all right?

239
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:21,007
I fucking have to. Do we have any weed?

240
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:22,917
Here I go.

241
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,887
Drink, drink.

242
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:30,717
I fucking hate Scotch.

243
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:38,177
-There's my friend Josh.
-Hey.

244
00:11:38,177 --> 00:11:40,267
-How are you?
-I'm hurting.

245
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,597
I'm not ready for that thing
that you're doing, like, you know...

246
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:45,447
I know you don't like it. Okay.

247
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:47,397
Hello.

248
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:48,987
Welcome to Day Two.

249
00:11:48,987 --> 00:11:51,197
The trail is somewhere along here.
We shouldn't miss it.

250
00:11:51,197 --> 00:11:55,077
It should be pretty, pretty obvious.

251
00:11:55,117 --> 00:11:57,537
You guys say you know something
about the Blair Witch?

252
00:11:57,537 --> 00:12:00,287
I've heard the myths.
l don't really believe much in it.

253
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,327
"The myth"?

254
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:03,117
-That's all I think it is.
-Damn fool kids'll never learn.

255
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:05,837
-What'd you say, sir? -I said, "You
damn fool kids'll never learn."

256
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:07,037
Shut up.

257
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:09,297
-"Damn fool kids'll never learn"?
-That's what I said.

258
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:11,127
And what makes you say that?

259
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:12,587
First of all, can I have your permission

260
00:12:12,587 --> 00:12:14,257
to put your image on video
for the purposes

261
00:12:14,257 --> 00:12:17,137
of a documentary entitled
The Blair Witch Project?

262
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:21,137
-I don't care much about that, but...
-Well, you have to say yes or no, sir.

263
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:22,307
-Watch it.
-Sorry.

264
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:23,977
Yeah, sure, that's all right.

265
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:27,897
Yeah, some girl back in the late 1800s,

266
00:12:27,897 --> 00:12:30,397
-Robin Weaver I believe her name was...
-Right.

267
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:33,737
...supposedly just wandered off,
disappeared into the woods.

268
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:38,237
Wasn't no "supposedly" about it.
They wandered off.

269
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:39,867
-Okay, so she wandered off.
-And she got lost.

270
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:40,997
She got lost.

271
00:12:40,997 --> 00:12:43,327
-Three days later...
-There wasn't no "supposedly."

272
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:48,997
Three days later, she just appears
back on her grandmother's porch.

273
00:12:48,997 --> 00:12:50,167
Right.

274
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:53,417
-And everybody's mystified about it.
-Right.

275
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:55,677
-She was babbling something...
-She had a tale to tell, too, though.

276
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:58,387
Yeah, she was babbling something
about the...

277
00:12:58,387 --> 00:13:02,227
An old woman whose feet
never touched the ground.

278
00:13:02,637 --> 00:13:04,227
-Did... Did you...
-I'll tell you, I saw,

279
00:13:04,227 --> 00:13:05,347
right up there by that tree,

280
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:07,727
-up the creek... I told you that.
-Right, I know.

281
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:11,727
About a hundred yards,
l saw a white misty thing

282
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:13,527
that I can't tell what it is, one day.

283
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:17,237
It was, like, a gray...
Like, gray vapor rising out of the trees?

284
00:13:17,237 --> 00:13:18,447
Right out of the water.

285
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:20,577
-Right out of the water, near the trees.
-Up the side of the tree,

286
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:21,947
and it disappeared over them...

287
00:13:21,947 --> 00:13:23,447
Now you're full of it.

288
00:13:23,457 --> 00:13:26,167
No, I'm not full of it,
and I wasn't drinking that day, either.

289
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:29,707
How is that related
to the story of Coffin Rock?

290
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:34,377
-It all ties in to the story
of Coffin Rock. -How's that?

291
00:13:34,377 --> 00:13:37,337
I mean,
anybody worth their salt around here

292
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:40,347
knows that this area's been haunted
by that old woman for years.

293
00:13:40,347 --> 00:13:43,397
That's bullshit.

294
00:13:45,227 --> 00:13:48,017
This is some serious woods
we're heading into.

295
00:13:48,017 --> 00:13:50,107
Excited?

296
00:13:50,107 --> 00:13:51,687
You got it.

297
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:56,537
I hope he's not rolling off
a whole shitload of stock.

298
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:17,587
Yeah.

299
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:19,177
I could help you,
but I'd rather stand and record.

300
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:20,257
Okay.

301
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:21,347
Packs are on?

302
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:23,387
-We're rocking. Let's rock.
-We're ready to go.

303
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:27,227
-We got to go up to the shack, the shanty?
-Yeah.

304
00:14:27,227 --> 00:14:29,737
Wow.

305
00:14:30,977 --> 00:14:32,977
Yeah, it's like we're off
to the Andes or something.

306
00:14:32,977 --> 00:14:37,077
Oh, my God, this is a very heavy backpack.

307
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:41,407
On our way to Coffin Rock.
We are totally on track.

308
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,037
I know exactly where we are now.

309
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:45,287
-Mikey, throw me the video camera.
-No, don't.

310
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:49,417
I wanna get her going across, man.

311
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:54,717
I see a dirty behind.

312
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:59,377
-Yeah. Good jump.
-Thank you, thank you.

313
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:04,427
There it is. See? That's Coffin Rock.

314
00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:06,727
Go.

315
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:11,977
"They went into the woods
prepared to find death.

316
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,937
"What they found was
a desecration of humanity

317
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:17,607
"at the site which trappers
have often referred to as Coffin Rock.

318
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:18,817
"On top of the rock formation

319
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:23,617
"the story of the torture inflicted
upon these brave five men unfolded.

320
00:15:23,617 --> 00:15:24,827
"Each was bound to the other,

321
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:27,497
"each man's hands bound
to the next man's feet,

322
00:15:27,497 --> 00:15:29,747
"forming a solid structure out of the men.

323
00:15:29,747 --> 00:15:32,167
"Blood at the edges of the head indicate
that this act had committed...

324
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:36,047
"Been committed while each was alive
and able-bodied enough to struggle.

325
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:39,757
"In the torso of each man
the intestines had been torn out crudely.

326
00:15:39,757 --> 00:15:43,887
"On each man's sun-bleached face
was inscribed indecipherable writing,

"cut into their flesh

328
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,887
"The men, still entranced
by the horror of what had happened,

329
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:50,687
"left the scene to find the sheriff,

330
00:15:50,687 --> 00:15:51,887

"and did not remove the bodies

"Upon return,
vultures were seen at the rock,

"the bodies had been removed

"The search party claimed

"and whomever had taken the bodies
had done so in a matter of hours."

337
00:16:09,117 --> 00:16:13,507
That happened here at Coffin Rock.

338
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:16,627
It felt really rushed
'cause I really want to get to camp,

339
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:19,337
and it's 4:52 and we're going to be late.

340
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:22,177
We're going to be losing light soon.

341
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:26,257
But, I mean, I can always use the shot
without me in it

342
00:16:26,257 --> 00:16:29,887
because I recorded sound in the rock
reading the whole thing.

343
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:33,687
So, I'm sure I can edit
it together somehow.

344
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:39,317
It's starting to rain.

345
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,817
-What did you do, rent this thing?
-Yeah.

346
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:43,317
l don't have a tent for three people.

347
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:45,407
-You know, I'm not used to...
-No, I'm just wondering.

348
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:48,777
I'm not usually traveling with two men,
if you know what I'm saying.

349
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:52,747
It is pouring rain right now.
We can't even get a fire going.

350
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:56,747
Show the kids at home
what the stick is for.

351
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:58,207
Look at that.

352
00:16:58,207 --> 00:16:59,957
We've got our very own leaning post.

353
00:16:59,957 --> 00:17:03,417
If you get too much ass
smell in the night...

354
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:06,087
Okay, who wouldn't let me have
a cigarette in the tent,

355
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:08,847
but he's allowed to fart
as much as he wants?

356
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:12,857
-l really don't think it's...
-No, I never gave Mike any fart allowance.

357
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:14,597
So, you heard noises last night?

358
00:17:14,597 --> 00:17:15,897
-l totally heard noise.
-See, the problem is,

359
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:17,227
l sleep like a fucking rock.

360
00:17:17,227 --> 00:17:19,357
It was like there were two separate noises

361
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:22,067
coming from two layers of space over here

362
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,897
and one of them was kind of, like...

363
00:17:23,897 --> 00:17:26,157
One of them could have
possibly been an owl,

364
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:28,777
but the other one was, like, a cackling...

365
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:30,117
-Was a definite...
-No way.

366
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:32,157
It was a total cackling, man.

367
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:35,577
If I heard a cackling,
l would've shit in my pants.

368
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:39,207
-Where'd we start out yesterday?
-Off the map.

369
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:41,297
-Off the map.
-'Cause I knew where we were going.

370
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:43,377
Though I know there was some confusion,

371
00:17:43,377 --> 00:17:45,587
-but today...
-Wait, wait, wait. Say that again.

372
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:47,547
l said, "l knew where we were going."

373
00:17:47,547 --> 00:17:48,797
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

374
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:51,557
-Would that be a full-of-shit statement?
-No, I did...

375
00:17:51,557 --> 00:17:53,597
-Would that be a full-of-shit statement?
-l did know where...

376
00:17:53,597 --> 00:17:56,307
All I'm saying is that
you got us lost, man.

377
00:17:56,307 --> 00:17:58,687
-For a very brief amount of time.
-Okay.

378
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:00,147
-Just don't get us lost today.
-It was very brief.

379
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,187
Yeah, serious.

380
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:02,437
I'm not.
l know where all of these places are.

381
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:03,977
They're all very well-documented.

382
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:06,107
So, what's up? Are you happy
with the way the documentary's going?

383
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:07,817
-Yes, I am. Yeah.
-Yeah?

384
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:11,077
And I'm very pleasantly surprised
by our little Mikey.

385
00:18:11,077 --> 00:18:14,587
-"Our little Mikey"?
-Our little Mikey.

386
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:18,367
-So, what's up?
-He's a very spirited young man.

387
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:21,167
l mean, what's your take
on the Blair Witch at this point?

388
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:25,807
-Do you think she exists?
-l don't know. I don't know.

389
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:28,627
Heather, I really wish
you'd found a trail...

390
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:30,797
There's a trail on top of this hill,
don't worry.

391
00:18:30,797 --> 00:18:34,217
-It is a trail.
-This is not a trail.

392
00:18:34,217 --> 00:18:38,027
We like shortcuts, don't we?

393
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:41,517
We like level shortcuts.

394
00:18:41,517 --> 00:18:43,727
-We don't like mountainous shortcuts.
-It's a little warmer today,

395
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:46,067
so this is the first time
we're seeing Mike's chest.

396
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:48,027
It's really hard to pick
up on video, actually.

397
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:51,487
Mike has really sporadic hair patterns
on his chest.

398
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:57,117
-It's like a symbol, man.
-It's, like, blank, hairy, blank, hairy.

399
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:58,207
You should see my ass.

400
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:01,707
Look, look. It's fucking Uruguay,
right there, right there.

401
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,377
-Wow.
-There's Paraguay over here.

402
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:05,797
-Yeah, whatever.
-Look, I think I see Bolivia.

403
00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:08,667
What killed this dead mouse?

404
00:19:08,677 --> 00:19:11,347
Witchcraft?

405
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,557
How about God?

406
00:19:14,557 --> 00:19:16,597
Is that the Blair Witch?

407
00:19:16,597 --> 00:19:21,817
No. I think it's Heather taking a piss.

408
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:25,517
You know, this is really not too good.
l really have to go.

409
00:19:25,527 --> 00:19:29,067
-Don't torture me.
-Go.

410
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,567
We are hot on the cemetery trail.

411
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:32,867
-It should only be a...
-Says you.

412
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:34,277
-What?
-Says you.

413
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:38,827
Says me, of course. And...

414
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:43,047
We should be hitting it
in about 90 minutes.

415
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:45,667
-You guys cool with that?
-What?

416
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,587
-90 minutes.
-As long as you know where we're going.

417
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,797
-Can you hang?
-l know exactly where we're going.

418
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:52,087
Josh feels it's necessary to look
at the map now, even though I know

419
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:54,007
where we're going
and we're going straight ahead up there.

420
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:56,557
If you've known where we're going,
we wouldn't be hiking like...

421
00:19:56,557 --> 00:19:57,637
We're in the middle of
the fucking woods, man.

422
00:19:57,637 --> 00:20:00,347
-How could you possibly know?
-Some of it is off-trail hiking.

423
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:01,557
Because people told you?

424
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:03,437
"Oh, yeah,
there's a cemetery back in there."

425
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:05,767
If we're lost, admit that first, because...

426
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:07,567
We're not... I know we're not lost.

427
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,397
You knew that yesterday, too,
and you knew that twice today.

428
00:20:09,397 --> 00:20:11,107
Look... No, bullshit, and I...

429
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:13,907
-We have not been lost at all today.
-That's...

430
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:15,447
-That is not true.
-Not once. I know where we're going.

431
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,907
-Okay, this is where we were.
-Let me tell you what you said to us.

432
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:20,157
"It's, like, two miles away."
Then, it's like, "Two hours away..."

433
00:20:20,157 --> 00:20:21,957
-Okay, just, just chill. Just chill.
-"Three hours away."

434
00:20:21,957 --> 00:20:24,167
Maybe it's four hours away.
How could you...

435
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:27,797
-Did you agree to do this project?
-I did. I agreed to a scouted-out project.

436
00:20:27,797 --> 00:20:29,297
I didn't agree to
just trounce around the woods.

437
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:31,047
It is scouted out,
and I told you getting to the location

438
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:32,587
-wasn't going to be easy.
-Mike, Mike... Okay! Guys!

439
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:35,137
-I've got $1,500 worth of equipment on me.
-Guys, it's cool, it's cool.

440
00:20:35,137 --> 00:20:37,007
Please, you're being a smartass,
you're being a smartass...

441
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:38,597
Let's just... We're looking at the map.

442
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:39,847
-We're going to find this the best we can.
-Okay.

443
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:41,767
I can totally find this.

444
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:43,557
This is where we were.

445
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:46,057
We're going more or less this way.

446
00:20:46,057 --> 00:20:49,567
Mika, what's your call?
l mean, where do you think we're going?

447
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:52,357
I'll tell you the truth.

448
00:20:52,357 --> 00:20:56,617
This is, like... This is Greek to me.

449
00:20:56,617 --> 00:20:57,827
-Right.
-It's useless.

450
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:59,197
Exactly.

451
00:20:59,197 --> 00:21:02,447
So, I'm just putting my trust in you

452
00:21:02,457 --> 00:21:04,867
that you know where it is.

453
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,877
Good.

454
00:21:06,877 --> 00:21:10,667
Although I got to tell you,
l don't fully trust you.

455
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:12,297
And l... No, I'm not going to say it.

456
00:21:12,297 --> 00:21:13,337
What?

457
00:21:13,337 --> 00:21:16,087
Nothing. I don't know why you have
to have every conversation on video, man.

458
00:21:16,087 --> 00:21:17,717
-Tape some ambiance.
-'Cause we're making a documentary.

459
00:21:17,717 --> 00:21:18,967
Not about us getting lost.

460
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:22,347
We're making a documentary about a witch.

461
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,017
l have a camera. Doesn't hurt because

462
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,767
we'll all look back on this
and laugh heartily, believe me.

463
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:31,027
Baby steps, man, baby steps.

464
00:21:31,027 --> 00:21:32,857
Just breathe and don't look down, maybe?

465
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:35,527
-No, you've got to look down.
-You're gonna have to crawl.

466
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:36,817
-I'm hitting the crawl.
-Cool.

467
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:38,907
Think about how cool the fucking cemetery

468
00:21:38,907 --> 00:21:42,497
is gonna be when we get there.

469
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:45,827
Think of the joy
of being in a really good film.

470
00:21:45,827 --> 00:21:48,877
-Okay, shut the fuck up.
-Okay, I'm quiet.

471
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:49,997
Shit. How am I gonna do this?

472
00:21:49,997 --> 00:21:53,047
-Okay, Mikey?
-Yeah?

473
00:21:53,047 --> 00:21:55,257
Dude, there's no way you're coming across

474
00:21:55,257 --> 00:21:56,757
with your DAT on your belly, man.

475
00:21:56,757 --> 00:22:00,047
-No way, man.
-There's no chance.

476
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:01,387
How are we going to get
the DAT across then?

477
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:02,717
It's really fucking hard, man.

478
00:22:02,717 --> 00:22:04,557
-How are we gonna get the DAT across?
-The one this morning

479
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,887
with the moss was cool.

480
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:11,447
-This is slippery as shit.
-How are we gonna get the DAT across?

481
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:14,687
I don't know. Let me get out of here
and put my pack down.

482
00:22:14,687 --> 00:22:16,737
I'll just go back and forth.

483
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:18,407
You want to go back and forth?
You could do it that way.

484
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:19,567
I didn't want to do this at all, but...

485
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:20,777
Okay, let's do...

486
00:22:20,777 --> 00:22:23,497
Yeah, we'll do it back and forth.

487
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:25,997
What'd you drop?

488
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:28,417
I didn't drop anything.

489
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:29,997
-The tree just broke on me.
-The log broke.

490
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:31,287
Oh, fuck.

491
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:35,347
We're very, very, very close now.

492
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:39,057
You guys excited?

493
00:22:40,597 --> 00:22:42,427
Okay.

494
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:45,147
What's this?

495
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:52,977
What is this?

496
00:22:52,977 --> 00:22:55,737
Dude. Guys?

497
00:22:55,857 --> 00:23:00,277
Do you remember something
that Mary Brown said the other day?

498
00:23:00,277 --> 00:23:02,947
What was the story from the Bible
that she was telling us?

499
00:23:02,947 --> 00:23:05,787
Fuck, I wasn't listening to her
'cause I thought she was a lunatic.

500
00:23:05,787 --> 00:23:09,117
It was Esau, but it
was something about a pile of rocks.

501
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:12,037
She was totally telling us
about her rocks, man.

502
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:15,957
What the fuck was it about a pile of rocks?

503
00:23:15,957 --> 00:23:19,087
Does anybody remember?

504
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:22,887
-"To live your life..."
-This is like...

505
00:23:22,887 --> 00:23:26,137
-"Live your life..."
-Looks like an Indian burial ground, man.

506
00:23:26,137 --> 00:23:32,067
See, I don't know if this counts.
Three... Four...

507
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:37,577
Five... Six...

508
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:39,277
Seven.

509
00:23:39,277 --> 00:23:43,947
Witches in days gone by
were roasted just like my Vienna sausage.

510
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:46,327
Flames are licking you
like the devil there, Josh.

511
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:50,537
Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale
A tale of a fateful trip

512
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:54,917
That started on this desert isle
Aboard this tiny ship

513
00:23:54,917 --> 00:24:00,297
Yeah, but this ship has a good captain, not
a fat, beer-guzzling guy in a blue shirt.

514
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:02,507
He wasn't beer-guzzling.

515
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,177
They had no beer on the island, man.

516
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:08,017
If they'd had beer,
they would have had, like, big-ass orgies.

517
00:24:08,017 --> 00:24:12,767
You're kind of like the Captain
and Mike's kind of like your Gilligan.

518
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:14,097
-No offense.
-That's all right.

519
00:24:14,107 --> 00:24:18,937
I mean that as a compliment.
Gilligan was a funny guy.

520
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:21,237
The Captain was fat, though.

521
00:24:21,237 --> 00:24:23,407
Well. Okay, let's call it a thin captain...

522
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:26,867
Let's not call it "the Captain" anymore,
you illiterate TV people.

523
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:29,657
It's the Skipper.

524
00:24:29,657 --> 00:24:32,787
-No more "captain."
-Oh, my.

525
00:24:32,787 --> 00:24:36,287
Here we are back at the rock again.
The rock thing.

526
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:39,297
The cemetery deal.

527
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:44,017
I just want to be careful
not to get in the film shot.

528
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:53,147
It certainly is odd.

529
00:24:58,317 --> 00:24:59,647
You didn't just knock that over.

530
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:01,107
Please, tell me
you didn't just knock that over.

531
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:02,897
I just knocked it over.

532
00:25:02,897 --> 00:25:05,657
That's not very nice.

533
00:25:05,657 --> 00:25:09,207
Let me put it back.

534
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:17,457
Can't be too careful.

535
00:25:17,457 --> 00:25:20,047
What did you think?

536
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:23,757
It was, you know,
the same thing, only darker.

537
00:25:23,757 --> 00:25:27,927
Yeah, pretty much. All right.

538
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:30,097
Bag it up, put it away.

539
00:25:30,097 --> 00:25:32,567
Hello?

540
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:35,607
Shit. The light.

541
00:25:41,027 --> 00:25:44,777
-We were sleeping.
-Do you want this?

542
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:48,787
Just keep it by the opening in the tent.

543
00:26:00,837 --> 00:26:03,347
Listen.

544
00:26:03,587 --> 00:26:04,887
Hello?

545
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:16,977
It's all around us.

546
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:19,097
That is fucking weird.

547
00:26:19,107 --> 00:26:21,477
Michael, are you saying
you're not coming down?

548
00:26:21,477 --> 00:26:23,147
-l ain't going down there.
-Why not?

549
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:24,357
Because I'm not. I don't hear shit...

550
00:26:24,357 --> 00:26:25,487
Because you're fucking scared.

551
00:26:25,487 --> 00:26:27,897
-Because I don't hear anything anymore.
-Because you're fucking scared.

552
00:26:27,907 --> 00:26:30,277
We heard... You could not deny hearing it.

553
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:33,877
Get your ass out. What's the big deal?

554
00:26:34,947 --> 00:26:37,577
-This rain fucking blows, man.
-l know.

555
00:26:37,577 --> 00:26:39,827
It's raining very heavily.

556
00:26:39,827 --> 00:26:43,087
Thank my mom for giving me rain gear
for my 18th birthday.

557
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:45,377
God bless her.

558
00:26:45,377 --> 00:26:49,087
What do you think that was last night?

559
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:50,837
-Personally?
-Yeah.

560
00:26:50,847 --> 00:26:53,507
I think it was
someone fucking with your head.

561
00:26:53,507 --> 00:26:55,347
But nobody knows we're out here.

562
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,477
Yeah, but you ever see Deliverance?

563
00:26:58,477 --> 00:26:59,977
Did you understand at all
where I was coming from?

564
00:26:59,977 --> 00:27:01,517
That I just wanted...
Whatever it was, I didn't know...

565
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:05,027
-You were freaking out. You bugged me out.
-I was freaking out.

566
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:07,277
I woke up all of a sudden
and shit's going down.

567
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:09,817
All I can think is,
"I got to get it. I got to get it."

568
00:27:09,817 --> 00:27:12,117
All I want it on...
I want it on sound, I want it on 16.

569
00:27:12,117 --> 00:27:15,367
If anything, if we can see anything,
I want to see it on 16.

570
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,407
Well, it sounded to me
like a bunch of people running around,

571
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:21,497
and I'm not down with messing
with the locals or whatever.

572
00:27:21,497 --> 00:27:22,917
I don't know who the hell
would come out here.

573
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:25,377
What bugs me out is that
we're so damn deep in the woods

574
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,167
and people are going to try and...

575
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,417
And come out here and mess with us,

576
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:29,757
then they got to have
something wrong with them.

577
00:27:29,757 --> 00:27:32,137
-And I'm not going to play with that.
-How do we know it was people?

578
00:27:32,137 --> 00:27:36,057
Well, even if it wasn't,
I'm not going to play with that, either.

579
00:27:36,217 --> 00:27:39,137
Fuck, man.

580
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:41,137
This has been a very long day.

581
00:27:41,147 --> 00:27:45,447
A very wet, very long day.

582
00:27:47,027 --> 00:27:50,897
Nobody's really speaking to me
at the moment.

583
00:27:50,907 --> 00:27:54,567
Dude, I don't remember a portion of this
from walking in.

584
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:55,697
What?

585
00:27:55,697 --> 00:27:58,497
I don't remember a portion of this
from walking in from the car.

586
00:27:58,497 --> 00:28:01,997
Well, we have to go a little differently

587
00:28:01,997 --> 00:28:06,217
to get back, because we went around
in a curve a little bit.

588
00:28:07,377 --> 00:28:11,337
I'm telling you guys, two more hours max.

589
00:28:11,337 --> 00:28:13,177
If the way we came in was the fastest,

590
00:28:13,177 --> 00:28:17,507
why the fuck are we going back
a different way?

591
00:28:17,517 --> 00:28:19,887
Because we have to go around. We came...

592
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:22,137
That was the most direct way
to hit our two locations.

593
00:28:22,147 --> 00:28:24,477
Now, this is the most direct way
back to the car.

594
00:28:24,477 --> 00:28:27,067
-Seriously, really?
-Yes. Seriously.

595
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:29,567
-You know exactly what's going on?
-Yes.

596
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:32,527
Let's just keep going.

597
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:35,447
Yeah, we'll wait five minutes
and do a map check.

598
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,027
All right.

599
00:28:37,027 --> 00:28:38,537
Okay, we just did a map check

600
00:28:38,537 --> 00:28:41,747
and it seems like
we're still pretty much on trail.

601
00:28:41,747 --> 00:28:44,117
That's not what I said.

602
00:28:44,127 --> 00:28:49,217
No, I think we're all right.
Come on, let's just keep going.

603
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:52,297
We took a map reading.
We just follow what the compass says.

604
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:55,387
We're going straight ahead.
We're going that way. That way.

605
00:28:55,387 --> 00:28:57,847
We are in the middle of nowhere.

606
00:28:57,847 --> 00:29:00,267
We've been in the middle
of nowhere for two days.

607
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:02,307
The car is parked
in the middle of nowhere almost.

608
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:06,447
Like, look at this shit, man.
This is nothing.

609
00:29:06,607 --> 00:29:10,617
Okay, let's just keep going, all right?

610
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:14,357
-I think we should camp.
-Get the fuck out of here.

611
00:29:14,357 --> 00:29:16,487
Why? Because you don't know
where we're going?

612
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:18,327
No, because I think
we're still a ways off from the car

613
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:21,617
and it's going to be
getting dark real soon.

614
00:29:21,617 --> 00:29:23,827
-Look, I'm not saying for certain...
-We're not camping here.

615
00:29:23,827 --> 00:29:25,707
-Get us home. Turn the camera off.
-Maybe we're near the car.

616
00:29:25,707 --> 00:29:27,247
-Get us home.
-Give me the fucking map.

617
00:29:27,247 --> 00:29:28,787
Give me the map. Heather, give me the map.

618
00:29:28,797 --> 00:29:31,667
-Turn the camera off and give me the map.
-Turn the camera off and get us home.

619
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:35,047
I'm not turning the camera off.
I want to mark this occasion.

620
00:29:35,047 --> 00:29:36,967
-Give me the map.
-The map is in my pocket.

621
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:38,257
You're going to have to wait a second.

622
00:29:38,257 --> 00:29:42,177
-You want to see the map?
-Goddamn!

623
00:29:42,177 --> 00:29:44,347
If we keep our heads together,
we'll be just fine.

624
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:47,767
-Fucking bullshit!
-Mike, chill.

625
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:49,357
Just relax, Mike.

626
00:29:49,357 --> 00:29:51,977
Don't fucking tell me to relax!

627
00:29:51,977 --> 00:29:54,567
Let's walk up, find a tree to sit under
or some shit, check the map...

628
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:58,567
Yes, can we find a place to sit
to check the map, please?

629
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:02,327
-Are you happy?
-I'm not happy, no.

630
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:03,447
But the car is not far.

631
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:05,367
We're just not going to be able to
find it in the dark.

632
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:08,117
Are you absolutely, positively sure?

633
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:10,167
Yes. I'm so sorry, man.

634
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:12,207
We can probably still
get the DAT back tomorrow.

635
00:30:12,207 --> 00:30:13,667
We have to. We have to.

636
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:14,877
We will. We will.

637
00:30:14,877 --> 00:30:16,877
We will get the DAT back
before it's due back tomorrow.

638
00:30:16,877 --> 00:30:18,887
I've got to get the fucking camera back.
I got to fucking work.

639
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:20,797
-Everything will get back tomorrow.
-I got to work.

640
00:30:20,807 --> 00:30:23,007
I'm supposed to be at work
tomorrow at 9:00, man.

641
00:30:23,017 --> 00:30:24,347
-I know.
-It's fine.

642
00:30:24,347 --> 00:30:29,017
-Let's just go to sleep. Let's go to sleep.
-Let's camp. Let's just fucking camp, okay?

643
00:30:29,017 --> 00:30:33,867
I want to get it.
I want to get it from inside the tent.

644
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:42,367
Whatever it was last night,
it sounds like the same fucking thing.

645
00:30:47,457 --> 00:30:51,217
Where's my boots? Fuck, it's cold.

646
00:30:55,297 --> 00:30:57,757
Hello?

647
00:31:00,047 --> 00:31:04,257
Oh, shit. It's fucking freezing.

648
00:31:04,267 --> 00:31:06,517
There.

649
00:31:06,517 --> 00:31:07,677
What?

650
00:31:07,687 --> 00:31:09,267
I hear it.

651
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,897
I don't hear shit.

652
00:31:11,897 --> 00:31:14,697
You hear that?

653
00:31:19,447 --> 00:31:21,867
Shit.

654
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:33,377
Hello?

655
00:31:52,557 --> 00:31:55,107
Oh, fuck.

656
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:04,817
I think it's just a deer.

657
00:32:04,827 --> 00:32:07,487
It could be deer, I guess.

658
00:32:07,497 --> 00:32:10,867
I don't fucking think it's deer, though, man.
It sounds exactly like the shit last night.

659
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:12,537
It's on all sides of us.

660
00:32:12,537 --> 00:32:15,957
-It's got to be just, like, a deer.
-It was a deer, man.

661
00:32:15,957 --> 00:32:19,507
-I think it was a fucking...
-It wasn't like last night.

662
00:32:24,347 --> 00:32:27,257
-Did you hear anything?
-Yes! Fucking listen.

663
00:32:27,257 --> 00:32:29,177
Okay, let's get it on DAT.
Let's get it on DAT. Be quiet.

664
00:32:29,177 --> 00:32:33,147
-Okay, it's on.
-Okay.

665
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:40,077
Jesus Christ! What the fuck is that? Fuck!

666
00:32:43,857 --> 00:32:47,997
It's obviously not scared by our yelling.

667
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:56,837
-But it sounds like footsteps.
-I know. That's a fucking person.

668
00:32:57,037 --> 00:32:58,547
Mikey, I'm not seeing shit on video.

669
00:32:58,547 --> 00:33:00,007
I'm going to leave the rest for DAT,
all right?

670
00:33:00,007 --> 00:33:01,127
I'm going to stay out
here with you, though.

671
00:33:01,127 --> 00:33:02,547
You got to fucking stay out here with me.

672
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,797
-I am, I am.
-What time is it?

673
00:33:04,797 --> 00:33:09,097
Is it fucking anywhere
near morning right now?

674
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:14,227
-Let's see...
-Please say it's fucking 5:00 or some shit.

675
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:17,977
-3:00.
-Fuck! This is bullshit.

676
00:33:17,977 --> 00:33:21,697
This is absolutely fucking crazy.

677
00:33:22,527 --> 00:33:24,987
I'm sorry, Mike.
We should be out of here already.

678
00:33:24,987 --> 00:33:29,447
This has got nothing, nothing to do
with what the fuck we're here for.

679
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:32,787
I swear to God, this is bullshit.

680
00:33:32,787 --> 00:33:36,667
Woke up this morning just,
like, two seconds ago,

681
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:41,137
and there are piles of rocks
outside of our tent.

682
00:33:43,257 --> 00:33:46,517
There are three, actually.

683
00:33:46,587 --> 00:33:49,137
Are you seriously fucking positive
those weren't there

684
00:33:49,137 --> 00:33:51,557
-when we went to bed last night?
-I am seriously fucking positive

685
00:33:51,557 --> 00:33:52,637
these were not here.

686
00:33:52,637 --> 00:33:55,307
How would we have, like,
just made a campsite

687
00:33:55,307 --> 00:33:59,557
in between three piles of rocks,
just by coincidence?

688
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:01,607
You don't think this is strange?

689
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:03,277
This is way fucking weird,

690
00:34:03,277 --> 00:34:05,147
but it really doesn't matter at this point

691
00:34:05,147 --> 00:34:07,947
because all I want to do
is get to the goddamn car.

692
00:34:07,947 --> 00:34:11,277
Whatever it is, man... Whatever it is
at this point... Whatever it is...

693
00:34:11,287 --> 00:34:13,237
I know, I know.
We have to get back to the car.

694
00:34:13,247 --> 00:34:15,407
-We're obviously not wanted here...
-Okay, okay...

695
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:16,957
-...so let's get the hell out.
-We're going home.

696
00:34:16,957 --> 00:34:19,167
We have to go...
We have to get the DAT back anyway.

697
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:21,457
-I realize that. That's what I'm saying.
-Okay, let's go.

698
00:34:21,457 --> 00:34:23,627
Let's get the DAT back.
Let's get our shit packed up.

699
00:34:23,627 --> 00:34:25,507
-We're out of here. We're out of here.
-Let's walk.

700
00:34:25,507 --> 00:34:26,927
-Can we just walk?
-Yes. We're out of here.

701
00:34:26,927 --> 00:34:28,967
Okay. Cool.

702
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:33,257
I can't believe we have to leave
just when shit's happening.

703
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:35,727
Heather, put the fucking camera down.
Let's pack up the tent.

704
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:39,147
-Okay. Hang on.
-Let's get the fuck out of the woods, okay?

705
00:34:39,147 --> 00:34:41,227
-Come on.
-No, I'm not fucking scared.

706
00:34:41,227 --> 00:34:44,647
I'm just tired, I'm hungry,
I'm fucking, like...

707
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:46,527
I'm just fucking done, man.

708
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:49,957
-All right.
-I'm just fucking done.

709
00:34:50,617 --> 00:34:52,447
Did you take it?

710
00:34:52,447 --> 00:34:56,627
No, I didn't take the fucking map, man.

711
00:34:58,457 --> 00:35:00,417
I'm not playing head games.

712
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:02,497
If anyone's playing head games,
you're playing head games.

713
00:35:02,497 --> 00:35:05,837
But I'm not playing head games.

714
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:08,417
I don't have it. We have to go.

715
00:35:08,427 --> 00:35:09,797
I'm serious. I don't have it.

716
00:35:09,797 --> 00:35:11,507
-Are you fucking serious?
-I'm fucking serious.

717
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:14,807
I don't have the map, okay?

718
00:35:14,967 --> 00:35:17,177
-Heather, that is so not cool, man.
-I know it's not cool.

719
00:35:17,177 --> 00:35:19,347
-That is so not cool.
-l know it's not cool.

720
00:35:19,347 --> 00:35:20,397
That is... That...

721
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:22,977
I mean, that's the fucking, like,
least responsible thing

722
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:25,187
you could have possibly done, man.

723
00:35:25,187 --> 00:35:27,867
I know that.

724
00:35:28,447 --> 00:35:31,747
You really don't have it?

725
00:35:31,987 --> 00:35:34,577
-One of you have got to have the map.
-No, I don't have the map.

726
00:35:34,577 --> 00:35:36,947
We gave it back to you
after map check yesterday.

727
00:35:36,947 --> 00:35:39,247
You've always had the map.

728
00:35:39,247 --> 00:35:40,957
I know, and I've always had
the map in the same place,

729
00:35:40,957 --> 00:35:43,837
and if it's not there,
one of you had to have taken it.

730
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:47,377
I'm not going into your fucking pants
to get your goddamn map, man.

731
00:35:47,377 --> 00:35:49,047
I just checked my pocket,
it's not in my pants.

732
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:50,717
Look, would I go in and get your map?

733
00:35:50,717 --> 00:35:53,217
All I want to do is get out of here, man.
I'm not fucking around.

734
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,347
-That's all I want, too, man.
-Let's go.

735
00:35:55,347 --> 00:35:57,387
No, you want to stay here,
you want to film rocks,

736
00:35:57,387 --> 00:35:59,307
you want to look around,
you want to fucking, like,

737
00:35:59,307 --> 00:36:00,887
-get this, you want to get that.
-Let's go.

738
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:02,557
-Which way are we walking?
-That way.

739
00:36:02,557 --> 00:36:05,817
Dude, we're in the middle
of the fucking woods!

740
00:36:05,817 --> 00:36:08,067
We're in the middle of the goddamn woods.
We can walk anyway...

741
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:10,897
We're going this way 'cause that's the way
we've been going for a fucking day.

742
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:13,157
We're going this way, and that's it.
We gotta come across something.

743
00:36:13,157 --> 00:36:14,487
I gave you the map, Josh.

744
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:17,037
-I gave you back the map, Heather.
-I gave you the map.

745
00:36:17,037 --> 00:36:20,407
I gave you back the map.

746
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:21,787
-Let's just go.
-All I'm saying is, we can move

747
00:36:21,787 --> 00:36:24,787
as fast as we want, but if we have
no fucking clue where we're moving to,

748
00:36:24,787 --> 00:36:25,997
then it really doesn't matter, does it?

749
00:36:25,997 --> 00:36:28,547
We're following the creek
and Mike seems satisfied with that.

750
00:36:28,547 --> 00:36:31,717
Would you guys stop it?

751
00:36:37,807 --> 00:36:43,187
We are gone. We are fucked, we are done,
we are dead, we're fucked.

752
00:36:46,517 --> 00:36:48,777
I'm just going to stay here.

753
00:36:48,777 --> 00:36:54,107
When you guys find somebody, tell them
I'm under this tree with the vine.

754
00:36:54,107 --> 00:36:57,077
All blame aside...

755
00:36:58,787 --> 00:37:00,867
-This is really fucked up.
-I know.

756
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:02,997
-Yeah.
-I know.

757
00:37:02,997 --> 00:37:05,917
We really, really, really need
to work together.

758
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:08,247
-Exactly. Exactly.
-I realize this.

759
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:11,257
Okay, so we deal with the fact
that my camera's not going to be back,

760
00:37:11,257 --> 00:37:13,337
your DAT's not going to be back.

761
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:16,137
No blame from now on about that shit.

762
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:20,557
Look, serious,
the area's not that fucking big.

763
00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:22,177
Exactly.

764
00:37:22,177 --> 00:37:24,477
It's very hard to get lost
in America these days,

765
00:37:24,477 --> 00:37:25,977
and it's even harder to stay lost.

766
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:29,687
So, we have that on our side. What?

767
00:37:29,687 --> 00:37:32,187
We're doing a pretty goddamn good job
of being lost.

768
00:37:32,187 --> 00:37:35,067
Because at this point,
when you're not home today,

769
00:37:35,067 --> 00:37:37,737
when I'm not home today,
people are going to start noticing.

770
00:37:37,737 --> 00:37:39,987
Like, my girlfriend
is definitely going to notice

771
00:37:39,987 --> 00:37:42,617
that I'm not back today,
and that I haven't fucking called.

772
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:44,287
l mean, if I called, it would be one thing.

773
00:37:44,287 --> 00:37:47,627
But, you know, if I just get back,
like, don't get back, period,

774
00:37:47,627 --> 00:37:49,127
and I don't call, she's going to notice.

775
00:37:49,127 --> 00:37:52,417
Which means that by tonight,
if we haven't found shit,

776
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,087
someone's going to be looking for us.

777
00:37:54,087 --> 00:37:55,217
Oh, no.

778
00:37:55,217 --> 00:37:56,927
Don't come this way. Go another way.

779
00:37:56,927 --> 00:38:01,607
Go down there. I just
got my whole shit wet.

780
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:06,847
Oh, shit. Well, let's try it this way.

781
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:12,317
l don't think you want to try this way.
l think you want to try the other way.

782
00:38:14,107 --> 00:38:17,607
If we didn't have these fucking packs,
it would be so much easier.

783
00:38:17,607 --> 00:38:19,117
-l don't mean to laugh.
-Dude, my feet are wet.

784
00:38:19,117 --> 00:38:22,997
Are you... Is that Michael laughing?

785
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:29,207
-Shut the fuck up and cross the stream.
-He's laughing.

786
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:33,257
Michael, that is the first time
I've heard you laugh in days.

787
00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:38,377
I'm really happy you find it very amusing

788
00:38:38,387 --> 00:38:40,177
that I'm going to be
incredibly uncomfortable

789
00:38:40,177 --> 00:38:42,557
for the rest of the day.

790
00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:45,727
Dude, uncomfortable just does not even...

791
00:38:45,727 --> 00:38:48,017
Can we keep going, please?

792
00:38:48,017 --> 00:38:51,107
No, we're going to chill out.

793
00:38:51,107 --> 00:38:52,267
l thought you wanted to get to the car.

794
00:38:52,267 --> 00:38:54,777
Oh, boy!

795
00:38:54,777 --> 00:38:58,737
-Okay, come on. Let's get up here.
-Oh, shit.

796
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:01,617
You guys weren't lying to me
about the map, were you?

797
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:03,277
'Cause this just seems like
you guys are having

798
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:05,077
just a little bit too
much fun for my taste.

799
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:07,577
-Heather.
-No, we're just going a little stir-crazy.

800
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:11,077
Heather, Heather,
if you make me yell at this point,

801
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:12,917
I'm going to have to yell at you, man.

802
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:17,547
Come on, seriously, if you have the map,
l just want to know that you have it.

803
00:39:17,547 --> 00:39:19,797
That would just make me happy,
just to know that you have it.

804
00:39:19,797 --> 00:39:21,467
Heather...

805
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:23,847
If I know that you have it,
and I can at least see it,

806
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:27,107
l will feel much better.

807
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:31,397
Like, all we're trying to do
is be cool with you.

808
00:39:31,397 --> 00:39:33,017
l find it very cool that I get laughed at

809
00:39:33,017 --> 00:39:34,607
because my shoes are wet
for the rest of the day.

810
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:38,027
l find it fucking hilarious.

811
00:39:40,737 --> 00:39:45,617
Heather, dude, all our shoes are wet.
We were laughing at the situation.

812
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,747
-Fine.
-We're fucking hungry, we're fucking tired.

813
00:39:47,747 --> 00:39:49,077
What the hell else are we supposed

814
00:39:49,077 --> 00:39:50,787
-to do at this point?
-You know what?

815
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:54,957
l kicked the...
I'm sorry, it's fucked up, it's fucked up.

816
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:59,757
But I kicked that fucking map
into the creek yesterday.

817
00:39:59,757 --> 00:40:01,467
It was useless.

818
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:05,147
l kicked that fucker into the creek.

819
00:40:08,347 --> 00:40:11,687
l fucking hope he's kidding.

820
00:40:11,687 --> 00:40:14,017
-Mike?
-Holy shit.

821
00:40:14,017 --> 00:40:16,397
-l really fucking hope he's kidding.
-Mike, are you kidding?

822
00:40:16,397 --> 00:40:18,857
-l really fucking hope he's kidding.
-Mike, are you fucking kidding?

823
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:20,777
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

824
00:40:20,777 --> 00:40:22,237
You've got to be kidding me.

825
00:40:22,237 --> 00:40:25,407
-You have got to fucking be kidding me!
-You think this is a fucking game?

826
00:40:25,407 --> 00:40:27,027
-Get the fuck off me, man.
-What the fuck?

827
00:40:27,037 --> 00:40:28,787
Are you out of your fucking mind?

828
00:40:28,787 --> 00:40:30,997
No, I'm not out of my mind!
That map wasn't doing shit for us.

829
00:40:30,997 --> 00:40:32,497
Do you realize... Not to you,

830
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:35,837
-but I knew what the fuck that map said!
-I'm sorry!

831
00:40:35,837 --> 00:40:38,667
-You are a fucking asshole!
-I'm sorry.

832
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:42,627
-You're a fucking asshole! And if we...
-That map wasn't doing shit all day!

833
00:40:42,627 --> 00:40:46,007
If we get hurt or we die out here,
it's your fucking fault!

834
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:50,607
It is your fucking fault!
Do you understand?

835
00:40:50,677 --> 00:40:54,557
l can't believe
you could be such an asshole!

836
00:40:54,557 --> 00:40:57,687
-What the fuck were you thinking?
-You're just fucking with my shit here!

837
00:40:57,687 --> 00:40:59,527
Okay, no... I'm not, I'm not...

838
00:40:59,527 --> 00:41:01,857
-That map was useless!
-If this was your own...

839
00:41:01,857 --> 00:41:04,197
-That map was useless!
-It was useless to you!

840
00:41:04,197 --> 00:41:07,027
Okay... Okay.

841
00:41:07,027 --> 00:41:09,367
This is not
why I brought you out here, man.

842
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:12,367
-Okay. Okay.
-I'm sorry about the map, man.

843
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:13,577
-What can I say?
-"Sorry"?

844
00:41:13,577 --> 00:41:15,627
-The map wasn't doing shit.
-Please, just don't say "sorry."

845
00:41:15,627 --> 00:41:17,917
The map was not worth shit to you.
l knew exactly

846
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:20,047
-where we were on that map.
-It wasn't worth shit to both of you.

847
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:21,547
-l asked you...
-l knew exactly where we were

848
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:22,797
-on that map!
-Listen to me!

849
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:24,757
Yesterday, I asked you
what fucking river we were on...

850
00:41:24,757 --> 00:41:26,387
You shut up
or I'm going to fucking stick your head...

851
00:41:26,387 --> 00:41:28,797
Turn this fucking camera off!

852
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:31,807
Give me the compass.

853
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:35,057
You've betrayed us all beyond...
Way fucking beyond...

854
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:37,227
-Bullshit, man.
-Give me the compass.

855
00:41:37,227 --> 00:41:39,567
You betrayed us when you couldn't
get us out of the woods last night.

856
00:41:39,567 --> 00:41:42,317
Yeah, thanks.

857
00:41:42,317 --> 00:41:43,897
-Can I hold the fucking compass now?
-No!

858
00:41:43,897 --> 00:41:47,027
-Can I hold the fucking compass?
-No.

859
00:41:47,027 --> 00:41:48,067
l bought the compass.

860
00:41:48,077 --> 00:41:49,867
-If you wanted a compass...
-l don't give a shit.

861
00:41:49,867 --> 00:41:51,077
You should have bought
your own fucking compass.

862
00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:52,577
You fucked us up. He fucked us up.

863
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:54,867
-l don't know why you can't admit...
-Let's just keep walking south.

864
00:41:54,867 --> 00:41:57,037
...that you've been screwed from
the moment we got out here, man.

865
00:41:57,037 --> 00:41:59,287
Because I haven't! Because I haven't.

866
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:08,087
Why are we stopped?

867
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:11,217
-Does... Does anybody have a...
-Just don't. Just don't.

868
00:42:11,217 --> 00:42:12,927
Does anybody have a reason
why we're stopped?

869
00:42:12,927 --> 00:42:16,277
That's all I'm asking you.

870
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:20,977
What about the plan to keep going south?
We all seemed very happy with that plan.

871
00:42:20,977 --> 00:42:24,737
Why is that not a thing anymore?

872
00:42:27,817 --> 00:42:30,577
Jesus Christ.

873
00:42:33,447 --> 00:42:36,617
-What?
-There's all sorts of stuff down here!

874
00:42:36,617 --> 00:42:40,757
-What kind of stuff?
-Like, voodoo shit.

875
00:42:41,707 --> 00:42:43,797
-What?
-Like, voodoo stuff.

876
00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:47,267
-It's hanging all over. Look around you.
-No way.

877
00:42:47,507 --> 00:42:51,347
-They're all over the place.
-Holy shit.

878
00:42:52,507 --> 00:42:54,767
Come up here, quick! I need to use the CP.

879
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:57,977
Yeah, there's all sorts
of shit up here, man.

880
00:42:57,977 --> 00:43:01,357
This is fucking crazy shit.

881
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:07,577
-Please, I got to get this on 16.
-Take the fucking camera.

882
00:43:10,657 --> 00:43:14,627
-What the fuck is this?
-l have no idea.

883
00:43:56,037 --> 00:44:00,837
Jesus Christ, that's fucking creepy.

884
00:44:03,497 --> 00:44:07,887
This is no redneck.
No redneck is this creative.

885
00:44:08,877 --> 00:44:12,547
-Can we get out of here now?
-Yeah, please?

886
00:44:12,547 --> 00:44:14,757
Okay, I've got everything on video, man.

887
00:44:14,757 --> 00:44:18,387
Jesus Christ, I didn't even
fucking see these, man.

888
00:44:18,387 --> 00:44:19,477
That's it, Heather.

889
00:44:19,477 --> 00:44:21,387
Heather, you've got enough, man. Let's go.

890
00:44:21,397 --> 00:44:23,847
-That's enough!
-Stop taping! Please, stop taping!

891
00:44:23,857 --> 00:44:25,267
-We've got it! It's enough!
-Okay.

892
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:28,227
Okay, okay, okay, we're leaving right now.

893
00:44:28,237 --> 00:44:33,317
Okay. Okay, we're out of here.
We're out of here. I'm leaving.

894
00:44:33,317 --> 00:44:34,617
Come on! Turn it off!

895
00:44:34,617 --> 00:44:39,997
Help! Help!

896
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,957
Please, help us!

897
00:44:43,077 --> 00:44:44,627
Help us!

898
00:44:44,627 --> 00:44:46,707
This is not the way to get out of here.

899
00:44:46,707 --> 00:44:50,417
Fuck!

900
00:44:50,417 --> 00:44:54,967
l think it's safe to say at this point
that we're lost,

901
00:44:54,967 --> 00:44:57,887
and I don't know what to do.

902
00:44:57,887 --> 00:45:00,517
l think we should all get inside the tent.

903
00:45:00,517 --> 00:45:01,597
All right.

904
00:45:01,597 --> 00:45:04,147
Let's not light a fire tonight.

905
00:45:04,147 --> 00:45:07,227
-Yeah. -Because two nights
in a row we've lit a fire.

906
00:45:07,227 --> 00:45:08,767
We didn't light one the first night...

907
00:45:08,777 --> 00:45:10,147
-And nothing happened.
-...and nothing happened.

908
00:45:10,147 --> 00:45:13,277
We light fires, they know.
l haven't heard anything follow us.

909
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,357
-We should even turn that light off, too.
-All right. All right.

910
00:45:15,367 --> 00:45:18,777
Seriously, man. Anything that's going
to attract attention to us at this point.

911
00:45:18,787 --> 00:45:22,747
Okay. Let's just go to sleep.

912
00:45:26,377 --> 00:45:28,887
What's going on?

913
00:45:35,887 --> 00:45:38,437
Oh, God.

914
00:45:42,137 --> 00:45:45,107
What's that sound?

915
00:46:02,577 --> 00:46:05,047
Jesus!

916
00:46:05,707 --> 00:46:08,707
-Jesus Christ, what if it's...
-What was that?

917
00:46:08,707 --> 00:46:10,207
-Jesus Christ.
-I'm going to put jeans on.

918
00:46:10,207 --> 00:46:11,587
Jesus! Jesus!

919
00:46:11,587 --> 00:46:13,337
Take the video camera.
No, get the DAT ready.

920
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:18,557
I'm going to take the video camera.
I'm gonna record this shit.

921
00:46:22,307 --> 00:46:25,897
Oh, dear God! Oh, dear God!

922
00:46:31,107 --> 00:46:33,277
Go! Fucking go!

923
00:46:33,277 --> 00:46:35,647
Oh, God!

924
00:46:35,647 --> 00:46:38,997
God! Fucking God!

925
00:46:39,777 --> 00:46:42,197
-Hurry up!
-I'm coming!

926
00:46:42,197 --> 00:46:44,657
My boots aren't laced.

927
00:46:44,657 --> 00:46:47,367
Oh, my God! What the fuck is that?

928
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:50,507
What the fuck is that?

929
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:59,477
Shit!

930
00:46:59,757 --> 00:47:02,437
Oh, my God!

931
00:47:05,387 --> 00:47:07,807
Mike, where are you going?

932
00:47:07,807 --> 00:47:10,317
Holy shit.

933
00:47:16,697 --> 00:47:19,357
Turn the lights off. Turn the lights off.

934
00:47:19,357 --> 00:47:23,367
Turn that light off. Turn it off, Josh.

935
00:47:24,487 --> 00:47:32,547
All lights off. All lights off.

936
00:47:35,087 --> 00:47:38,047
-I'm soaking.
-It's okay.

937
00:47:38,047 --> 00:47:41,677
What's that? What the fuck is going on?

938
00:47:41,677 --> 00:47:45,017
What the fuck is going on?

939
00:47:48,517 --> 00:47:50,977
Did you hear that baby screaming?

940
00:47:50,977 --> 00:47:53,307
Shut the fuck up.
There's no fucking baby out there.

941
00:47:53,317 --> 00:47:55,567
-Yes, there was.
-There's no fucking baby out there.

942
00:47:55,567 --> 00:47:59,037
Okay. Okay. Okay.

943
00:48:00,237 --> 00:48:04,417
l haven't heard anything since we ran away.

944
00:48:05,287 --> 00:48:08,117
Oh, my God, it's cold.

945
00:48:08,117 --> 00:48:10,787
-We should be quiet, okay?
-Okay, okay.

946
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:13,797
We should be quiet.

947
00:48:19,587 --> 00:48:24,057
l don't hear anything anymore.
Maybe we should go back.

948
00:48:25,387 --> 00:48:27,347
How long have we been here?

949
00:48:27,347 --> 00:48:30,857
l don't know. A fucking hour.

950
00:48:31,267 --> 00:48:34,777
The sun's up. We're okay now.

951
00:48:35,147 --> 00:48:36,937
Let's just get back. Let's pack shit up.

952
00:48:36,937 --> 00:48:40,027
-Let's get out.
-Okay.

953
00:48:41,657 --> 00:48:44,157
What the fuck, man?

954
00:48:44,157 --> 00:48:47,947
-Where's my pack?
-Your pack is right there. Where's my pack?

955
00:48:47,947 --> 00:48:50,957
What the fuck, man?

956
00:48:56,997 --> 00:48:59,877
How come we're getting
fucked with like this?

957
00:48:59,877 --> 00:49:02,007
They just opened it up.

958
00:49:02,007 --> 00:49:06,387
-They spilled all my fucking water.
-That looks like slime, man.

959
00:49:06,387 --> 00:49:08,387
It's just water, man.

960
00:49:08,387 --> 00:49:11,017
-It is slime. What the fuck is that?
-It's slime, dude.

961
00:49:11,017 --> 00:49:12,347
Let's get this shit packed up
and get out of here.

962
00:49:12,347 --> 00:49:15,187
-Come on, Heather. Turn that thing off.
-Heather, come on, let's go.

963
00:49:15,187 --> 00:49:16,557
Heather, let's move it.

964
00:49:16,557 --> 00:49:17,897
I'm not interested in anything anymore.
Let's go.

965
00:49:17,897 --> 00:49:20,687
-l know! I know!
-So, turn it off.

966
00:49:20,687 --> 00:49:24,277
Just relax for just a second.
Have we gotten everything here?

967
00:49:24,277 --> 00:49:26,277
-Like I give a shit.
-Whose shit was thrown around?

968
00:49:26,277 --> 00:49:29,917
-Who specifically?
-It's my shit!

969
00:49:30,947 --> 00:49:32,037
-My shit.
-Why you?

970
00:49:32,037 --> 00:49:34,577
Let's go! Let's go.
Are you not scared enough?

971
00:49:34,577 --> 00:49:35,827
No, but why you?

972
00:49:35,827 --> 00:49:38,377
-Put the camera down. This is not funny.
-I'm coming.

973
00:49:38,377 --> 00:49:40,707
Do I look like I'm laughing at all?

974
00:49:40,707 --> 00:49:43,757
No, but you're going around
doing your documentary thing, man.

975
00:49:43,757 --> 00:49:46,087
-You're still doing your fucking thing.
-Don't fucking...

976
00:49:46,087 --> 00:49:48,387
Then turn the goddamn thing off!

977
00:49:48,387 --> 00:49:52,387
If you bite me one more time,
l will throw you in the fucking woods.

978
00:49:52,387 --> 00:49:53,557
You touch my camera one more time,

979
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:54,727
-I'll bite you again.
-Turn that thing off!

980
00:49:54,727 --> 00:49:57,397
-Sorry.
-l didn't mean it, okay?

981
00:49:57,397 --> 00:50:00,147
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine. I just...

982
00:50:00,147 --> 00:50:03,397
l want to go home, but it's important...
l just want to get what we can.

983
00:50:03,397 --> 00:50:06,197
What the fuck?

984
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:08,907
Is this possible?

985
00:50:08,907 --> 00:50:11,577
Okay, all right.

986
00:50:11,577 --> 00:50:13,037
Here I go.

987
00:50:13,037 --> 00:50:15,997
l hate crossing streams on logs.

988
00:50:15,997 --> 00:50:19,587
If I never cross another stream
on a log for the rest of my life,

989
00:50:19,587 --> 00:50:22,637
l will die a happy girl.

990
00:50:23,257 --> 00:50:27,517
l see why you like
this video camera so much.

991
00:50:27,587 --> 00:50:31,597
-You do?
-It's not quite reality.

992
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:36,307
Reality says we got to move.

993
00:50:36,307 --> 00:50:40,817
No, but it's totally like
a filtered reality, man.

994
00:50:41,147 --> 00:50:46,367
It's like you can pretend
everything's not quite the way it is.

995
00:50:47,947 --> 00:50:49,777
Just leave him alone for now.

996
00:50:49,777 --> 00:50:52,787
-We need to go.
-Just leave him alone for five minutes.

997
00:50:52,787 --> 00:50:55,407
-Mike...
-Just leave him alone.

998
00:50:55,407 --> 00:50:59,417
Five minutes. Come on. He's lost it.

999
00:50:59,537 --> 00:51:01,127
l know that, but we're all on the brink

1000
00:51:01,127 --> 00:51:03,417
-of losing it.
-l know we are.

1001
00:51:03,417 --> 00:51:05,377
-We got to take care of each other.
-l know.

1002
00:51:05,377 --> 00:51:06,797
And there's no way we're taking care of him

1003
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:09,637
if we're going to throw the camera
in his face if he's crying.

1004
00:51:09,637 --> 00:51:11,757
-l know that.
-l know you know.

1005
00:51:11,757 --> 00:51:13,467
l know we're both about to lose it,

1006
00:51:13,467 --> 00:51:16,347
-but let's try and keep the last
wits we have. -We have to...

1007
00:51:16,347 --> 00:51:18,227
l understand we have to go.
Believe me, I know.

1008
00:51:18,227 --> 00:51:21,057
It's hard for all of us to hold it together.
We need to get out of here

1009
00:51:21,057 --> 00:51:22,817
-in one piece, and this is not helping.
-l know this.

1010
00:51:22,817 --> 00:51:25,397
You're not telling me
anything I don't know.

1011
00:51:25,397 --> 00:51:29,197
-Just let him have his...
-Does anybody have a cigarette?

1012
00:51:29,197 --> 00:51:32,657
-No, man.
-No, there's none left.

1013
00:51:32,657 --> 00:51:34,737
Nobody has any cigarettes?

1014
00:51:34,737 --> 00:51:37,377
We're out.

1015
00:51:38,827 --> 00:51:43,837
What the fuck was this blue jelly shit
all over my shit?

1016
00:51:43,837 --> 00:51:47,377
Let's go. Let's go.

1017
00:51:47,377 --> 00:51:51,137
If we keep going south, we will get out.

1018
00:51:51,137 --> 00:51:53,507
Please.

1019
00:51:53,507 --> 00:51:57,347
l don't want to set up camp
another fucking night, man.

1020
00:51:57,347 --> 00:52:00,137
-Josh, none of us do.
-l know. I know you don't.

1021
00:52:00,147 --> 00:52:03,607
Whatever it is, is going to come back.
We know that for a fact.

1022
00:52:03,607 --> 00:52:04,897
We don't know that for a fact.

1023
00:52:04,897 --> 00:52:07,817
It came three nights in a row,
and it's getting worse every night.

1024
00:52:07,817 --> 00:52:10,447
l would love to hear this right now.
l really would.

1025
00:52:10,447 --> 00:52:13,867
I'm just trying to say that,
you know, we have to

1026
00:52:13,867 --> 00:52:15,777
-rationally say...
-l know.

1027
00:52:15,787 --> 00:52:19,907
They might very well go on forever
compared to our footsteps.

1028
00:52:19,907 --> 00:52:21,917
Not possible.

1029
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:25,087
-Not possible in this country.
-Why is it not possible?

1030
00:52:25,087 --> 00:52:27,207
Because this is America
and it's not possible.

1031
00:52:27,207 --> 00:52:29,207
We've destroyed
most of our natural resources.

1032
00:52:29,217 --> 00:52:31,517
Let's just keep going.

1033
00:52:49,857 --> 00:52:55,497
No, that's the tree we crossed.
That tree is down. That's the same one.

1034
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:59,447
-Oh, God!
-No. Oh, no.

1035
00:52:59,447 --> 00:53:03,077
You've got to be kidding me!
This is a joke!

1036
00:53:03,077 --> 00:53:06,707
-No...
-This is not funny!

1037
00:53:06,707 --> 00:53:08,747
Mike, just please stop.

1038
00:53:08,757 --> 00:53:10,757
Please... Please stop.

1039
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:13,467
Please stop.

1040
00:53:13,507 --> 00:53:15,257
-Please stop.
-Oh, no!

1041
00:53:15,257 --> 00:53:19,147
No. No, Mike, it's not the same log.

1042
00:53:19,427 --> 00:53:21,597
-It's not the same log, Mike.
-It's the same one!

1043
00:53:21,597 --> 00:53:24,937
-Look, it's not.
-It is! Open your eyes!

1044
00:53:24,937 --> 00:53:28,107
It's not the same log.

1045
00:53:29,477 --> 00:53:31,277
It's not...

1046
00:53:31,277 --> 00:53:34,107
It's not the same log.

1047
00:53:34,107 --> 00:53:36,537
Fuck.

1048
00:53:41,197 --> 00:53:43,207
-Fuck!
-It's the same log.

1049
00:53:43,207 --> 00:53:45,367
-Fuck!
-Fuck!

1050
00:53:45,377 --> 00:53:48,037
It's the same log.

1051
00:53:48,037 --> 00:53:50,797
Fuck you, God!

1052
00:53:50,797 --> 00:53:53,757
It's the same log.

1053
00:54:00,057 --> 00:54:01,467
Okay.

1054
00:54:01,467 --> 00:54:07,987
It's okay. It's okay.

1055
00:54:08,437 --> 00:54:12,317
Where do you want to go to camp?
I guess today south didn't work out,

1056
00:54:12,317 --> 00:54:16,947
so tomorrow we'll go east.
I don't know what to say, Josh.

1057
00:54:16,947 --> 00:54:19,367
How the fuck did we walk south
all day and wind up...

1058
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:23,657
We've walked south all day, okay?
We walked south all fucking day.

1059
00:54:23,657 --> 00:54:26,797
I don't know how we ended up here.

1060
00:54:32,957 --> 00:54:37,467
Do you expect me to do something
or say something?

1061
00:54:44,517 --> 00:54:47,987
What do you want to do, Josh?

1062
00:54:52,527 --> 00:54:54,947
Josh?

1063
00:54:58,657 --> 00:55:02,247
I want to make movies, Heather.

1064
00:55:03,487 --> 00:55:07,167
Isn't that what we're here to do?

1065
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:11,127
-Let's make some movies.
-Fuck you.

1066
00:55:12,167 --> 00:55:14,707
Fuck you. Really. Fuck you.

1067
00:55:14,707 --> 00:55:17,047
Please, let's not fight. Please.

1068
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:21,007
Come on, I can't. I can't listen to fighting.
l can't fight.

1069
00:55:21,007 --> 00:55:24,217
We're screwed and that's it.
Please stop fighting.

1070
00:55:24,217 --> 00:55:26,897
Both of you.

1071
00:55:26,977 --> 00:55:30,227
I'll do the first watch.

1072
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:33,197
l got first watch.

1073
00:55:39,947 --> 00:55:42,907
-Come on, you can do better than that.
-This is not the place or the time, guys.

1074
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:45,447
-We have things to prepare for here.
-Okay, here's your motivation.

1075
00:55:45,447 --> 00:55:49,287
You're lost, you're angry in the woods,
and no one here is here to help you.

1076
00:55:49,287 --> 00:55:51,457
There's a fucking witch
and she keeps leaving shit

1077
00:55:51,457 --> 00:55:52,787
-outside your door.
-Josh.

1078
00:55:52,787 --> 00:55:55,667
There's no one here to help you.
She left little trinkets.

1079
00:55:55,667 --> 00:55:57,257
-Josh.
-You fucking took one of them.

1080
00:55:57,257 --> 00:55:59,337
She ran after us.
There's no one here to help you.

1081
00:55:59,337 --> 00:56:02,337
-Josh!
-We walked for 15 hours today.

1082
00:56:02,347 --> 00:56:04,257
We ended up in the same place.

1083
00:56:04,257 --> 00:56:05,677
-There's no one here to help you.
-Just stop.

1084
00:56:05,677 --> 00:56:06,927
-Josh!
-That's your motivation!

1085
00:56:06,927 --> 00:56:08,927
Would you please stop?

1086
00:56:08,937 --> 00:56:11,727
That's your motivation.

1087
00:56:11,727 --> 00:56:15,817
-Please stop.
-Josh. Just quit it.

1088
00:56:15,817 --> 00:56:17,977
-She's had enough.
-Please stop.

1089
00:56:17,987 --> 00:56:20,027
Come on, man, you got her back. Good one.

1090
00:56:20,027 --> 00:56:22,567
No, she's still making movies, man.
That's my point.

1091
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:24,277
-Please stop.
-This is my point here.

1092
00:56:24,277 --> 00:56:28,037
It's all I fucking have left, okay?
Just please stop.

1093
00:56:28,037 --> 00:56:30,407
Please stop.

1094
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:34,427
Just please stop yelling at me, please.

1095
00:56:38,377 --> 00:56:41,927
Come on, I'm fucking tired
of crying all day here.

1096
00:56:41,927 --> 00:56:44,717
We got to think like human beings.
We have things to prepare for.

1097
00:56:44,717 --> 00:56:48,807
We got to make shifts. We got lots to do.

1098
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:58,277
You going to write us
a happy ending, Heather?

1099
00:57:05,617 --> 00:57:08,287
Come on, man, turn it off.

1100
00:57:08,287 --> 00:57:12,797
You're getting like she was.
Come on, turn it off.

1101
00:57:15,327 --> 00:57:18,877
Dude, I can't believe we're even
stitching those pants at this point, man.

1102
00:57:18,877 --> 00:57:21,337
Well, I'm cold, man.

1103
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,177
-l know.
-l hear you.

1104
00:57:23,177 --> 00:57:26,217
-l know.
-The smallest comforts we can get are good.

1105
00:57:26,217 --> 00:57:29,007
Doesn't it just seem absurd, though,
at this point?

1106
00:57:29,017 --> 00:57:30,517
Yes, it does.

1107
00:57:30,517 --> 00:57:32,847
A lot of things seem absurd.

1108
00:57:32,847 --> 00:57:36,147
Like sleeping right where we were
pretty much sleeping last night.

1109
00:57:36,147 --> 00:57:39,977
That's just fucking me up, period.

1110
00:57:39,977 --> 00:57:44,117
That's just fucked up, man. That's just...

1111
00:57:47,277 --> 00:57:50,867
-I'm sorry, man.
-You chill. It's all right.

1112
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:54,407
-I'm sorry, Heather.
-It's okay.

1113
00:57:54,417 --> 00:57:57,167
Who wants a cheeseburger?

1114
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:59,377
l do. I do.

1115
00:57:59,377 --> 00:58:04,057
-l got a cheeseburger in my back pocket.
-Do you?

1116
00:58:04,087 --> 00:58:06,257
Can I have a light to cut this?

1117
00:58:06,257 --> 00:58:09,097
-You know what I fucking love?
-What?

1118
00:58:09,097 --> 00:58:11,807
Mashed potatoes.

1119
00:58:11,807 --> 00:58:14,357
Me, too.

1120
00:58:15,477 --> 00:58:19,067
My mom's mashed potatoes.

1121
00:58:22,487 --> 00:58:26,197
You'll have them again very soon.

1122
00:58:26,277 --> 00:58:30,497
My mom's mashed potatoes
and a piece of ass.

1123
00:58:31,327 --> 00:58:33,707
Josh!

1124
00:58:36,207 --> 00:58:38,997
Fuck, Mike, we never go out of earshot.

1125
00:58:38,997 --> 00:58:42,637
-Josh!
-Hold on, calm down.

1126
00:58:43,377 --> 00:58:45,087
How could l...

1127
00:58:45,087 --> 00:58:53,887
Josh!

1128
00:58:53,977 --> 00:58:55,927
He's probably at the river or something.

1129
00:58:55,937 --> 00:58:58,437
If he was at the river,
he could hear me from here.

1130
00:58:58,437 --> 00:59:01,487
-Josh!
-Josh!

1131
00:59:03,437 --> 00:59:06,067
Got to wait for him to respond.

1132
00:59:06,067 --> 00:59:10,407
-Do you remember what he said yesterday?
-What?

1133
00:59:11,027 --> 00:59:15,167
About the shit on his bag, about how...

1134
00:59:16,367 --> 00:59:18,207
Josh!

1135
00:59:18,207 --> 00:59:21,457
Let's go. We got to find him.

1136
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:23,797
-Come on.
-We can't even find the car!

1137
00:59:23,797 --> 00:59:26,047
How the fuck are we going to find Josh?

1138
00:59:26,047 --> 00:59:27,377
Heather, come on.

1139
00:59:27,377 --> 00:59:29,297
-No. No.
-Come on, come on.

1140
00:59:29,297 --> 00:59:30,507
-I'm fine.
-Come here, come on.

1141
00:59:30,507 --> 00:59:32,297
Relax, relax.

1142
00:59:32,307 --> 00:59:34,137
All right, we'll relax.
We'll break down the tent.

1143
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:37,677
When he's back, we'll be ready to go, okay?

1144
00:59:37,687 --> 00:59:39,057
I'm losing my mind, Mike.

1145
00:59:39,057 --> 00:59:42,777
-Josh hasn't come back.
-Heather!

1146
00:59:42,937 --> 00:59:46,617
-I'm over here, Mike.
-Okay.

1147
00:59:47,897 --> 00:59:51,957
l don't know if Josh ran off. I don't...

1148
00:59:51,987 --> 00:59:55,077
All his shit's here.

1149
00:59:55,327 --> 00:59:57,787
I've got the camera.

1150
00:59:57,787 --> 01:00:00,997
l don't know how the fuck
I'm going to hike with that camera, but...

1151
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:02,827
You sure you want to
take the fucking camera?

1152
01:00:02,837 --> 01:00:06,167
We've got to take the camera.

1153
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:13,267
How do you feel about east?

1154
01:00:13,847 --> 01:00:17,147
Well, south didn't work.

1155
01:00:17,427 --> 01:00:18,637
Which wicked witch was worse,

1156
01:00:18,637 --> 01:00:23,057
The Wicked Witch of the East
or The Wicked Witch of the West?

1157
01:00:23,057 --> 01:00:26,017
The Wicked Witch of the West
was the bad one.

1158
01:00:26,027 --> 01:00:29,367
Well, let's go east.

1159
01:00:31,237 --> 01:00:34,027
What the hell's that?

1160
01:00:34,027 --> 01:00:36,417
Josh?

1161
01:00:36,987 --> 01:00:39,377
Josh!

1162
01:00:40,367 --> 01:00:44,167
We're going to put up the tent now.

1163
01:00:53,967 --> 01:00:56,177
I'm going to have a meatball.

1164
01:00:56,177 --> 01:00:59,967
-Just one meatball?
-And a long, red glass of wine.

1165
01:00:59,977 --> 01:01:03,187
Yeah, I would definitely
have a whole fucking bottle of Bordeaux.

1166
01:01:03,187 --> 01:01:05,397
And a fresh pack of smokes.

1167
01:01:05,397 --> 01:01:08,977
Smokes would be good,
and a long, hot bath.

1168
01:01:08,977 --> 01:01:10,397
And a big pumpkin pie.

1169
01:01:10,397 --> 01:01:14,117
A big pumpkin pie. With ice cream?

1170
01:01:14,487 --> 01:01:18,407
-Warm, with melty ice cream.
-Yeah, that sounds good.

1171
01:01:18,407 --> 01:01:22,667
What's your favorite thing
to do on a Sunday?

1172
01:01:23,207 --> 01:01:26,917
It used to be drive to the woods
and go hiking.

1173
01:01:26,917 --> 01:01:30,587
But I think that...

1174
01:01:30,587 --> 01:01:35,557
-That might change now.
-l think you can scratch that off.

1175
01:01:43,937 --> 01:01:46,447
Oh, God.

1176
01:01:48,687 --> 01:01:51,477
Should we go for him?

1177
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:54,287
Is it a trick?

1178
01:02:02,707 --> 01:02:05,087
Josh?

1179
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:08,087
Josh!

1180
01:02:12,087 --> 01:02:15,137
-It's stopped.
-Josh!

1181
01:02:19,097 --> 01:02:22,267
Where's it coming from?

1182
01:02:30,937 --> 01:02:33,327
Josh!

1183
01:02:34,987 --> 01:02:39,117
Josh, where are you?
Tell me where you are!

1184
01:02:41,237 --> 01:02:43,917
Oh, my God!

1185
01:02:44,407 --> 01:02:46,757
No.

1186
01:02:47,577 --> 01:02:50,757
Fuck. Oh, God.

1187
01:02:50,997 --> 01:02:53,667
Do you think that it's
them fucking with us?

1188
01:02:53,667 --> 01:02:55,717
l don't know.

1189
01:02:55,717 --> 01:02:58,137
Josh!

1190
01:03:00,007 --> 01:03:03,937
-Is it over here?
-No, it's over here.

1191
01:03:04,177 --> 01:03:07,567
Josh!

1192
01:03:13,687 --> 01:03:16,737
We'll look for him.

1193
01:03:27,997 --> 01:03:31,537
l don't know if it's really him.
l don't know if it's really him.

1194
01:03:31,537 --> 01:03:33,967
Josh!

1195
01:03:43,807 --> 01:03:46,927
l don't even know where to look.

1196
01:03:46,927 --> 01:03:49,397
Josh!

1197
01:03:50,897 --> 01:03:54,407
Tell me where you are, Josh!

1198
01:03:56,607 --> 01:03:58,317
Mike?

1199
01:03:58,317 --> 01:04:02,707
-Please don't fall asleep.
-l can't fall asleep.

1200
01:04:05,367 --> 01:04:09,627
Whatever it is, knows that Josh is gone.

1201
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:18,637
If that was Josh,
he would have said where he was.

1202
01:04:21,587 --> 01:04:25,397
Whatever it was, sounded like Josh.

1203
01:04:26,057 --> 01:04:28,397
See.

1204
01:04:28,427 --> 01:04:32,307
l just want to show that Mike is here.

1205
01:04:32,307 --> 01:04:35,107
He's sleeping.

1206
01:04:41,107 --> 01:04:43,657
Oh, shit.

1207
01:04:46,117 --> 01:04:49,287
What the hell is that?

1208
01:04:51,117 --> 01:04:53,837
-Mike?
-What?

1209
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:57,587
There's something out here.

1210
01:05:02,797 --> 01:05:07,097
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1211
01:05:07,217 --> 01:05:09,967
Okay, I'm just going to move it
from the front of the tent.

1212
01:05:09,977 --> 01:05:13,937
-Get rid of it.
-Okay. I'm taking it away.

1213
01:05:13,937 --> 01:05:18,067
I'm taking it away from
the front of the tent.

1214
01:05:18,067 --> 01:05:21,277
I'm just throwing it.

1215
01:05:23,157 --> 01:05:25,457
Okay.

1216
01:05:25,737 --> 01:05:27,947
We'll just keep walking.

1217
01:05:27,947 --> 01:05:30,707
-Okay?
-Okay.

1218
01:05:31,577 --> 01:05:33,747
-Just keep walking.
-Okay.

1219
01:05:33,747 --> 01:05:35,577
l found some cigarettes.

1220
01:05:35,577 --> 01:05:38,087
l found them all the way
at the bottom of my pack.

1221
01:05:38,087 --> 01:05:40,457
Which means we're still alive,
'cause we're smoking.

1222
01:05:40,457 --> 01:05:42,807
Okay.

1223
01:06:17,377 --> 01:06:21,637
I'm just going to undo this very quietly
and see what's in here.

1224
01:06:30,967 --> 01:06:34,187
It's all full of blood.

1225
01:06:47,357 --> 01:06:49,787
No.

1226
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:15,637
Shit. Shit.

1227
01:07:15,637 --> 01:07:16,937
Shit.

1228
01:07:22,777 --> 01:07:31,577
Oh, my God.

1229
01:07:35,657 --> 01:07:37,537
Okay.

1230
01:07:37,537 --> 01:07:40,497
Okay, see? Okay...

1231
01:07:40,497 --> 01:07:42,927
Yeah?

1232
01:07:43,087 --> 01:07:46,507
-What are you doing?
-I'm okay. I'm just washing my hands off.

1233
01:07:46,507 --> 01:07:49,967
-What?
-I'm just washing my hands off.

1234
01:07:49,967 --> 01:07:53,257
I'm fine. I'm going to put my gloves on...

1235
01:07:53,257 --> 01:07:57,807
I'm going to put my gloves on my hands.
I'm going to put my gloves on my hands.

1236
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:01,777
I'm going to put my gloves on my hands.

1237
01:08:02,977 --> 01:08:05,897
-You all right?
-I'm okay. I'm okay.

1238
01:08:05,897 --> 01:08:08,277
Okay.

1239
01:08:08,817 --> 01:08:11,567
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1240
01:08:11,567 --> 01:08:15,987
-You need help?
-No, no. No, I don't need any help.

1241
01:08:15,987 --> 01:08:17,117
I'm okay.

1242
01:08:17,117 --> 01:08:19,157
-What happened?
-Nothing. Nothing happened.

1243
01:08:19,157 --> 01:08:22,997
I'm just very hungry and I'm very tired
and I'm very scared

1244
01:08:22,997 --> 01:08:25,087
-and I just want to go home, okay?
-Okay.

1245
01:08:25,087 --> 01:08:28,807
But I'm fine, and we're both okay.

1246
01:08:31,467 --> 01:08:33,847
Okay.

1247
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:38,147
My hair's caught.

1248
01:08:39,557 --> 01:08:42,647
Thank you. Thank you.

1249
01:08:44,977 --> 01:08:48,987
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1250
01:09:31,397 --> 01:09:34,737
2,130 games,

1251
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:38,707
one more season and Cal Ripken is king!

1252
01:09:39,407 --> 01:09:42,457
Cal Ripken is king!

1253
01:09:42,657 --> 01:09:45,417
And I won't get to see it

1254
01:09:45,417 --> 01:09:48,837
'cause I'll be in the woods!

1255
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:06,737
Tell me you're not eating a dry leaf.

1256
01:10:17,117 --> 01:10:20,417
I just want to apologize

1257
01:10:20,697 --> 01:10:28,167
to Mike's mom and Josh's mom
and my mom...

1258
01:10:30,837 --> 01:10:34,177
And I'm sorry to everyone.

1259
01:10:35,507 --> 01:10:38,427
I was very naive.

1260
01:10:41,807 --> 01:10:49,277
I am so, so sorry
for everything that has happened

1261
01:10:49,977 --> 01:10:55,117
because in spite of what Mike says now,
it is my fault

1262
01:10:55,817 --> 01:10:58,607
because it was my project

1263
01:10:58,617 --> 01:11:01,537
and I insisted.

1264
01:11:01,947 --> 01:11:04,657
I insisted on everything.

1265
01:11:04,657 --> 01:11:08,297
I insisted that we weren't lost.

1266
01:11:08,827 --> 01:11:12,337
I insisted that we keep going.

1267
01:11:12,417 --> 01:11:15,967
I insisted that we walk south.

1268
01:11:16,547 --> 01:11:19,587
Everything had to be my way

1269
01:11:19,587 --> 01:11:23,177
and this is where we've ended up.

1270
01:11:23,177 --> 01:11:26,807
And it's all because of me
that we're here now,

1271
01:11:26,807 --> 01:11:30,607
hungry and cold

1272
01:11:31,437 --> 01:11:34,117
and hunted.

1273
01:11:38,407 --> 01:11:42,997
I love you, Mom and Dad.

1274
01:11:45,197 --> 01:11:47,997
I am so sorry.

1275
01:11:53,167 --> 01:11:55,927
What is that?

1276
01:12:07,557 --> 01:12:10,637
I'm scared to close my eyes.

1277
01:12:10,647 --> 01:12:13,907
I'm scared to open them.

1278
01:12:19,817 --> 01:12:22,067
Oh, God.

1279
01:12:22,067 --> 01:12:25,417
I'm going to die out here.

1280
01:12:28,207 --> 01:12:30,957
-You got it?
-You ready?

1281
01:12:30,957 --> 01:12:32,417
Somebody!

1282
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:36,507
-Jesus Christ.
-Please don't go out there.

1283
01:12:44,677 --> 01:12:46,557
-Okay.
-You ready?

1284
01:12:46,557 --> 01:12:48,057
Here, take this light.

1285
01:12:48,057 --> 01:12:50,597
Please!

1286
01:12:50,597 --> 01:12:54,397
It's okay. It can't be him.

1287
01:13:30,767 --> 01:13:33,437
Please, follow my voice!

1288
01:13:33,437 --> 01:13:36,987
Holy shit. It's a house.

1289
01:13:37,187 --> 01:13:38,977
-Holy shit.
-Watch your step.

1290
01:13:38,977 --> 01:13:42,117
Holy shit. Holy shit.

1291
01:14:02,217 --> 01:14:04,637
Josh?

1292
01:14:17,607 --> 01:14:21,397
Mike. Mike. Mike.

1293
01:14:21,397 --> 01:14:23,987
-Mike?
-Come on.

1294
01:14:23,987 --> 01:14:25,697
Mike, where the fuck are you?

1295
01:14:25,697 --> 01:14:28,197
Come on. In the house.

1296
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:31,917
Mike, do not go in there, please.

1297
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:41,137
Mike.

1298
01:14:43,507 --> 01:14:44,877
Mike?

1299
01:14:44,877 --> 01:14:47,307
Mike!

1300
01:14:49,347 --> 01:14:51,807
Mike, please.

1301
01:14:51,807 --> 01:14:55,437
-Mike, where are you?
-I'm right here!

1302
01:15:01,647 --> 01:15:05,447
-Where is he?
-Mike, please don't do this.

1303
01:15:14,247 --> 01:15:17,257
-Is he in here?
-No.

1304
01:15:31,097 --> 01:15:32,637
Jesus.

1305
01:15:32,637 --> 01:15:35,017
Where is he?

1306
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:38,107
Do we go upstairs?

1307
01:15:38,727 --> 01:15:41,147
l hear him. I hear him.

1308
01:15:41,147 --> 01:15:44,367
l hear you! Josh?

1309
01:15:51,737 --> 01:15:54,747
I'm going upstairs!

1310
01:16:02,587 --> 01:16:04,877
Oh, God.

1311
01:16:04,877 --> 01:16:07,677
You hear that?

1312
01:16:08,167 --> 01:16:11,677
Where is he? Where are you?

1313
01:16:13,307 --> 01:16:16,437
Come on. Josh?

1314
01:16:18,637 --> 01:16:21,437
l hear him downstairs.

1315
01:16:21,437 --> 01:16:25,067
Come on! I hear him downstairs!

1316
01:16:25,107 --> 01:16:27,227
-Mike!
-Come on!

1317
01:16:27,237 --> 01:16:28,987
-Mike!
-Josh!

1318
01:16:28,987 --> 01:16:31,407
Wait!

1319
01:16:33,327 --> 01:16:35,867
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1320
01:16:35,867 --> 01:16:37,037
-Josh?
-Mike!

1321
01:16:37,037 --> 01:16:40,827
-Josh, is that you down there?
-Mike!

1322
01:16:40,827 --> 01:16:43,297
Mike!

1323
01:16:43,957 --> 01:16:46,337
Josh.

1324
01:16:47,417 --> 01:16:56,217
Mike!

1325
01:17:20,327 --> 01:17:23,667
Mike! Mike!
