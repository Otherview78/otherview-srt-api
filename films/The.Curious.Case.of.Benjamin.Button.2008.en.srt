1
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:39,869
<i>...and I'll tell you what, the
storm system's still moving west.</i>

2
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,972
What are you looking
at, Caroline?

3
00:00:44,017 --> 00:00:45,575
The wind, Mom.

4
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:51,088
They say the
hurricane is coming.

5
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:55,922
I'm on a boat.

6
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:58,293
I'm drifting.

7
00:01:00,634 --> 00:01:02,932
Can I do anything for you, Mom?

8
00:01:04,304 --> 00:01:06,169
Make anything easier?

9
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,539
Oh, sugar...

10
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:11,339
There's nothing left to do.

11
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:13,437
Is what it is.

12
00:01:14,948 --> 00:01:17,917
Finding it harder to
keep my eyes open.

13
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:23,014
My mouth's full of cotton.

14
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:25,683
There, there, Miss Daisy.

15
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:28,522
You gonna scratch
yourself to ribbons.

16
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:36,231
Do you want any more
medication, Mother?

17
00:01:37,137 --> 00:01:40,334
Doctor said you could
have as much as you want.

18
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,704
No need for anybody to suffer.

19
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:00,592
A friend told me that she
never had the chance

20
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:02,992
to say goodbye to her mother.

21
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:08,464
- I wanted to...
- It's okay.

22
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:12,095
I wanted to tell you how much
I'm gonna miss you so...

23
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:13,664
Mom.

24
00:02:15,675 --> 00:02:17,438
Oh, Caroline.

25
00:02:23,249 --> 00:02:24,739
Are you afraid?

26
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:26,546
I'm curious.

27
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:29,948
What comes next?

28
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:40,262
They built the train
station in 1918.

29
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:44,031
My father was there
the day it opened.

30
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:48,401
He said they had

31
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:51,640
a tuba band playing.

32
00:02:56,416 --> 00:03:00,477
They had the finest clockmaker
in all of the South

33
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:03,885
to build that glorious clock.

34
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,317
<i>His name was...</i>

35
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:11,026
Mr. Gateau.

36
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:16,562
Mr. Cake.

37
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,303
<i>He was married to a Creole
of Evangeline Parish</i>

38
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,640
<i>and they had a son.</i>

39
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,677
<i>Mr. Gateau was, from
birth, absolutely blind.</i>

40
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:39,186
<i>When their son was old
enough, he joined the army.</i>

41
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:44,495
<i>And they prayed God would
keep him out of harm's way.</i>

42
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:52,167
<i>For months, he did nothing
but work on that clock.</i>

43
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:57,675
<i>One day,</i>

44
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:00,945
<i>a letter came.</i>

45
00:04:06,186 --> 00:04:09,917
<i>And Mr. Gateau,
done for the night,</i>

46
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:13,114
<i>went up, alone, to bed.</i>

47
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:18,593
<i>And their son came home.</i>

48
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,568
<i>They buried him in
the family plot,</i>

49
00:04:26,673 --> 00:04:30,575
<i>where he would be with
them when their time came.</i>

50
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:35,673
<i>Mr. Cake worked on his clock,</i>

51
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:42,146
<i>laboring to finish.</i>

52
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:47,390
<i>It was a morning to remember.</i>

53
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:51,823
<i>Papa said there were
people everywhere.</i>

54
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:55,826
<i>Even Teddy Roosevelt came.</i>

55
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:15,451
It's running backwards!

56
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,819
I made it that way

57
00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:22,291
so that perhaps the boys
that we lost in the war

58
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:23,760
might stand and come home again.

59
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:30,101
<i>Home to farm,</i>

60
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:32,398
<i>work,</i>

61
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:35,668
<i>have children.</i>

62
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:41,446
<i>To live long, full lives.</i>

63
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:47,313
Perhaps my own son
might come home again.

64
00:05:55,995 --> 00:05:58,520
I'm sorry if I've
offended anybody.

65
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:02,363
I hope you enjoy my clock.

66
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:07,137
<i>Mr. Cake was never seen again.</i>

67
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:15,914
<i>Some say he died
of a broken heart.</i>

68
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:19,948
<i>Some say he went to sea.</i>

69
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:26,251
Excuse me.

70
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:28,919
Do you mind if I make a call?
Somebody's watching my little boy.

71
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:30,256
Sure.

72
00:06:40,506 --> 00:06:42,736
I hope I haven't
disappointed you.

73
00:06:42,842 --> 00:06:45,936
You couldn't disappoint me.

74
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:52,282
Well, I know I don't have
much to show for myself.

75
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:57,288
Find my dark suitcase.

76
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:04,562
There's a diary.

77
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:07,791
This?

78
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:13,437
Could you read it to me?

79
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,238
Is this what you want to do?

80
00:07:16,342 --> 00:07:20,244
I tried to read it a
hundred different times.

81
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:23,205
Mom, it's not exactly...

82
00:07:23,316 --> 00:07:26,717
it's just the sound of
your voice, darling.

83
00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:28,547
Okay.

84
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:34,660
It's dated April 4th, 1985.

85
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:38,127
And it says New Orleans.

86
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:40,961
"This is my last
will and testament."

87
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:45,265
"I don't have much to leave, few
possessions, no money, really."

88
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:50,905
"I will go out of this world the same
way I came in, alone and with nothing."

89
00:07:51,577 --> 00:07:53,413
"All I have is my story,"

90
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:56,947
"and I'm writing it now
while I still remember it."

91
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,913
"My name is Benjamin.
Benjamin Button."

92
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:04,381
<i>And I was born under
unusual circumstances.</i>

93
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:07,588
<i>The First World War had ended,</i>

94
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:12,162
<i>and I've been told it was an
especially good night to be born.</i>

95
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,961
Thank God it's over!

96
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,866
We won the war!

97
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:34,582
The Great War is over!

98
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:47,890
What are you doing here?

99
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,297
Thomas,

100
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:51,969
I'm afraid she's going to die.

101
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:53,231
What?

102
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:58,036
That's enough. All of
you, get away from her.

103
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:04,341
I came as quickly as I could. The
streets are filled with people.

104
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,712
Thomas.

105
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:08,813
Promise me he has a place.

106
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:12,350
Yeah.

107
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:15,717
<i>She gave her life for me.</i>

108
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:19,732
<i>And for that, I am
forever grateful.</i>

109
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:30,741
Mr. Button.

110
00:09:46,058 --> 00:09:47,286
Thomas!

111
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:48,621
Thomas.

112
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,791
Thomas? Where are you going?

113
00:10:21,427 --> 00:10:23,759
Hey! What are you doing there?

114
00:10:24,997 --> 00:10:27,022
What do you have there?

115
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,022
- Come on, Queenie.
- Now, Mr. Weathers!

116
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:30,493
Come on, now, you know I ain't got
nothing but work to do around here.

117
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:32,860
- Come on. Just take some time.
- Stop all this foolishness.

118
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:37,831
The air is sweet.

119
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:45,335
You look very handsome
tonight, Miss Queenie.

120
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,806
Handsome as I've ever seen.

121
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:52,479
The brown matches your eyes.

122
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:53,916
Oh, hush!

123
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:59,518
Let's see here. You ain't
no slouch yourself.

124
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,897
Hambert's back in town.

125
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:13,768
He came home legless,
but he's home.

126
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:17,402
I know you were sweet
on him one time.

127
00:12:17,944 --> 00:12:19,809
Sweeter than I should've been.

128
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:21,812
Miss Simone messed herself.

129
00:12:21,914 --> 00:12:23,142
Oh, sweet Jesus.

130
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:25,774
She got to stop doing that
or it's diapers for her.

131
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:27,910
- I'll be right there, Miss Jameson!
- Now, Queenie, now come on.

132
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,580
Okay, Queenie'll be right there.

133
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,952
It's awful nice out here.

134
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:35,255
Come on out back for a moment.
Take your mind off things.

135
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:36,385
You're so bad.

136
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:38,963
- What in God's name?
- What's this?

137
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:51,572
Oh, the Lord done
something here.

138
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:55,169
Hope I didn't hurt it none
stepping on it like that.

139
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:56,805
We best leave that
for the police.

140
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,406
Poor baby.

141
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:00,582
I'll go.

142
00:13:01,253 --> 00:13:04,916
It's for sure nobody wanted to keep it.
Come on, baby.

143
00:13:07,593 --> 00:13:10,027
Queenie? Where are you, Queenie?

144
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:12,063
Hold your water! You
go deal with it.

145
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:14,257
Okay. No, go, I'll be back.

146
00:13:15,134 --> 00:13:18,399
Queenie, Apple, she went and
messed herself all over again!

147
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:20,369
Jane Childress,
start her a bath!

148
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:22,532
And mind your own business, Mrs.
Duprey.

149
00:13:22,642 --> 00:13:24,439
You'll be messing
yourself soon enough.

150
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:26,101
Somebody stole my necklace.

151
00:13:26,212 --> 00:13:29,147
Okay. All right, Mrs. Hollister,
I'll be right with you, okay?

152
00:13:29,248 --> 00:13:31,443
Go on back upstairs, hear?

153
00:13:37,757 --> 00:13:40,282
You are as ugly as an old pot

154
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:42,054
but you're still a child of God.

155
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:44,527
Queenie, Apple, she won't
take a bath without you!

156
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,097
Mercy.

157
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:48,166
I'll be right there!

158
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:54,138
Okay. You just wait right
here for me now, okay?

159
00:13:57,476 --> 00:14:02,106
My sister gave me those pearls.
I can't find them anywhere.

160
00:14:02,214 --> 00:14:06,048
- Somebody's been stealing my jewelry.
- They're right here, Mrs. Hollister. See?

161
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:09,451
Right around your pretty white neck.
Now, come on. Hush all that noise.

162
00:14:09,555 --> 00:14:12,149
- Is Dr. Rose still here?
- I don't know.

163
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,257
Your heart is strong.

164
00:14:16,362 --> 00:14:19,331
You just want to avoid
any undue stimulation.

165
00:14:19,932 --> 00:14:23,026
I trust you ladies will
help me out with that?

166
00:14:23,135 --> 00:14:26,263
I have something. Could
you come downstairs?

167
00:14:29,975 --> 00:14:33,672
Never seen anything like it.
Nearly blind from cataracts.

168
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,840
I'm not sure if he can hear. His
bones indicate severe arthritis.

169
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:43,053
His skin has lost all elasticity, and
his hands and feet are ossified.

170
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:47,751
He shows all the deterioration, the
infirmities, not of a newborn,

171
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,488
but of a man well in his 80s
on his way to the grave.

172
00:14:50,596 --> 00:14:51,585
He's dying?

173
00:14:51,697 --> 00:14:54,928
His body is failing him
before his life's begun.

174
00:14:57,303 --> 00:14:58,736
Where'd he come from?

175
00:14:58,838 --> 00:15:03,207
My sister's child. From Lafayette.
She had an unfortunate adventure.

176
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:07,211
The poor child, he got the worst of it.
Come out white.

177
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:14,845
There are places for unwanted
babies like these, Queenie.

178
00:15:15,488 --> 00:15:18,150
No room for another
mouth to feed here.

179
00:15:18,257 --> 00:15:20,782
The Nolan Foundation, despite
their good intentions,

180
00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:23,657
thinks this place is a
large nuisance as it is.

181
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:23,863
- A baby...
- You said he don't have long.

182
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:25,922
- A baby...
- You said he don't have long.

183
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:30,593
Queenie, some creatures
aren't meant to survive.

184
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:37,737
No, this baby, he is a miracle.
That's for certain.

185
00:15:37,843 --> 00:15:40,835
Just not the kind of
miracle one hopes to see.

186
00:15:43,883 --> 00:15:46,374
Y'all listen. Y'all
listen up here.

187
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:48,177
We're gonna have us a visitor

188
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:51,381
that's gonna be staying
with us for a little while.

189
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,187
My sister had a child and she
couldn't see right by it, so...

190
00:15:57,463 --> 00:15:59,192
He's known as...

191
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:03,765
Benjamin.

192
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:05,733
Benjamin.

193
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,574
He's not a well child, so we're gonna
have to take good care of him.

194
00:16:09,675 --> 00:16:10,733
I had 10 children.

195
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:14,176
There's not a baby I can't care for.
Let me see him.

196
00:16:16,382 --> 00:16:20,011
God in Heaven. He looks
just like my ex-husband.

197
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:23,481
Look, he's prematurely old.

198
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:27,516
Dr. Rose said he ain't got
much more time on this earth.

199
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,986
Join the club.

200
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:35,566
He's smiling!

201
00:16:42,341 --> 00:16:45,003
Hambert sends his
remembrances to you.

202
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,152
Are you right out of your mind?

203
00:16:58,457 --> 00:17:01,824
I know you ain't got all the parts
it takes to make one of your own,

204
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:03,155
but this ain't yours to keep.

205
00:17:03,262 --> 00:17:05,526
It may not even be humankind.

206
00:17:14,673 --> 00:17:17,073
Mr. Weathers, come back here.

207
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:20,639
Please.

208
00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:39,556
You never know what's
coming for you.

209
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:51,941
<i>It seemed I had found a home.</i>

210
00:17:55,114 --> 00:17:56,172
Is any of this true?

211
00:17:56,282 --> 00:17:59,649
You have such a lovely voice.

212
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:04,883
Mom, it's an ancient
streetcar token.

213
00:18:06,592 --> 00:18:09,720
That clock just kept going,

214
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:14,927
year after year after year.

215
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:21,138
<i>But I didn't know I was a child.</i>

216
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,708
Same old crap every day.

217
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,374
<i>I thought I was like
everyone else there.</i>

218
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,541
<i>An old man in the
twilight of his life.</i>

219
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:32,981
Could you make him stop that?

220
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:37,046
Stop banging that fork. It's used
for eating, not for playing with.

221
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:39,989
And use your napkin, please, Mr.
Benjamin.

222
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:43,623
Queenie!

223
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,005
Hey, boy.

224
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:06,681
<i>Always had a healthy curiosity.</i>

225
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:11,311
<i>What was up the street? Or
around the next corner?</i>

226
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:14,489
Go get him!

227
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:18,290
Benjamin! That is dangerous.
Come back over here.

228
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:20,760
Stay put, child.

229
00:19:23,135 --> 00:19:25,069
<i>I loved her very much.</i>

230
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:27,498
<i>She was my mother.</i>

231
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:28,766
Mama.

232
00:19:29,475 --> 00:19:30,601
Mama.

233
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,176
Some days I feel different
than the day before.

234
00:19:36,615 --> 00:19:40,642
Everybody feels different about
themselves, one way or another.

235
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,918
But we're all going
the same way.

236
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,953
Just taking different roads
to get there, that's all.

237
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:51,529
You're on your own
road, Benjamin.

238
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,961
Mama? How much longer I got?

239
00:19:57,469 --> 00:20:00,768
Just be thankful for
what you're given, hear?

240
00:20:00,873 --> 00:20:03,933
You're already here longer
than you're supposed to.

241
00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:09,746
<i>Some nights, I'd
have to sleep alone.</i>

242
00:20:18,457 --> 00:20:20,118
<i>I didn't mind.</i>

243
00:20:21,026 --> 00:20:23,756
<i>I would listen to the
house breathing.</i>

244
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:27,022
<i>All those people sleeping.</i>

245
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,695
<i>I felt safe.</i>

246
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:54,151
<i>It was a place of great routine.</i>

247
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:57,160
<i>Every morning at 5:30,
no matter the weather,</i>

248
00:20:57,262 --> 00:21:01,323
<i>General Winslow, U.S. Army,
Retired, would raise the flag.</i>

249
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:08,162
<i>Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once an
opera singer of some note,</i>

250
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:10,901
<i>well, she sang Wagner.</i>

251
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:24,154
All right, baby, come on.

252
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:28,090
We got to put some life into
these old sticks for you.

253
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:32,493
Get you walking so you can help me
out around here. Come on now, hear?

254
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,433
<i>No matter the season, supper
was served promptly at 5:30.</i>

255
00:21:37,536 --> 00:21:39,697
Molasses.

256
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:41,033
Molasses.

257
00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:43,832
Molasses.

258
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,335
I learned to read
when I was five.

259
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:51,848
My grandfather was a dresser
for a famous actor.

260
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,646
He brung home every
play for me to read.

261
00:21:56,889 --> 00:22:00,620
"Kind keepers of my
weak decaying age,"

262
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,155
"Let dying Mortimer
here rest himself."

263
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:08,661
"Even like a man new
haled from the rack,"

264
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:11,463
"So fare my limbs with
long imprisonment."

265
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:15,833
"And these gray locks, the
pursuivants of death,"

266
00:22:16,475 --> 00:22:19,444
"Argue the end of
Edmund Mortimer."

267
00:22:23,348 --> 00:22:25,750
You thought I was plain
ignorant, didn't you?

268
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:26,410
You thought I was plain
ignorant, didn't you?

269
00:22:26,518 --> 00:22:30,147
The actor my grandfather worked
for was John Wilkes Booth.

270
00:22:32,457 --> 00:22:34,482
He killed Abraham Lincoln.

271
00:22:36,261 --> 00:22:38,889
You never know what's
coming for you.

272
00:22:39,598 --> 00:22:43,193
<i>On Saturday nights, Mama
would make me go to church.</i>

273
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:48,370
Benjamin!

274
00:22:58,717 --> 00:23:00,275
- Amen! Amen!
- Amen! Amen!

275
00:23:02,888 --> 00:23:05,220
What can I do for you, sister?

276
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:20,528
Her parts are all twisted up inside
and she can't have little children.

277
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:28,370
Lord, if you could see clear
to forgive this woman her sins

278
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,573
so she can bear the
fruit of the womb.

279
00:23:30,682 --> 00:23:33,082
Out, damnable affliction!

280
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:35,346
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

281
00:23:35,454 --> 00:23:36,614
Hallelujah!

282
00:23:36,722 --> 00:23:38,189
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

283
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:42,989
And what's this old
man's irrediction?

284
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:46,129
He's got the Devil on his back,

285
00:23:46,231 --> 00:23:49,496
trying to ride him into the
grave before his time.

286
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:54,237
- Out, Zebuchar!
- Yes!

287
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:56,170
- Out, Beelzebub!
- Yes!

288
00:23:58,076 --> 00:23:59,805
How old are you?

289
00:23:59,911 --> 00:24:02,402
Seven. But I look a lot older.

290
00:24:03,482 --> 00:24:04,972
God bless you.

291
00:24:05,584 --> 00:24:07,051
He's seven.

292
00:24:09,855 --> 00:24:13,791
Now, this is a man with
optimism in his heart.

293
00:24:13,892 --> 00:24:15,587
- All right.
- Belief in his soul!

294
00:24:15,694 --> 00:24:16,683
- Yes!
- Yes!

295
00:24:16,795 --> 00:24:18,592
We are all children
in the eyes of God!

296
00:24:18,697 --> 00:24:19,994
- Yes!
- Hallelujah!

297
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:22,965
We are gonna get you
out of that chair.

298
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:25,093
- And we're gonna have you walk.
- Amen.

299
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:27,529
It's all right.

300
00:24:28,473 --> 00:24:30,668
In the name of God's glory...

301
00:24:31,543 --> 00:24:32,976
Rise up!

302
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:35,844
Come on.

303
00:24:37,683 --> 00:24:39,446
Come on. Walk.

304
00:24:39,551 --> 00:24:40,984
Come on, son. Come on.

305
00:24:41,086 --> 00:24:43,816
- Come on with it, son. Come on.
- Come on.

306
00:24:43,922 --> 00:24:47,289
Now God is gonna see you
the rest of the way.

307
00:24:47,392 --> 00:24:52,193
He's gonna see this little old man walk
without the use of a crutch or a cane.

308
00:24:52,297 --> 00:24:54,094
He's gonna see that you
walk from faith...

309
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:57,168
- Hallelujah!
- ...and divine inspiration alone!

310
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:58,429
- Yes.
- Hey, Ben!

311
00:24:58,537 --> 00:24:59,834
- Go, son!
- Now walk.

312
00:24:59,938 --> 00:25:01,166
- Yes.
- Come on.

313
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:04,935
Don't touch him.

314
00:25:07,312 --> 00:25:09,041
Rise up, old man.

315
00:25:10,115 --> 00:25:12,675
Rise up like Lazarus.

316
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:14,911
I said, rise up!

317
00:25:15,587 --> 00:25:16,952
Hallelujah!

318
00:25:19,124 --> 00:25:20,318
Yes.

319
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:21,986
Come on.

320
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:23,083
Say hallelujah.

321
00:25:23,195 --> 00:25:24,560
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

322
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:27,492
Walk.

323
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,359
Walk on. Yes.

324
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:35,263
That's right, Benjamin.

325
00:25:35,374 --> 00:25:38,605
<i>Now when I look back on
it, it was miraculous.</i>

326
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:42,737
<i>But you know the saying, the Lord
giveth and the Lord taketh away.</i>

327
00:25:43,014 --> 00:25:44,879
Glory in the highest!

328
00:25:48,987 --> 00:25:50,147
Sweet Jesus!

329
00:25:50,288 --> 00:25:51,380
- No!
- No!

330
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:55,190
<i>There were so many birthdays.</i>

331
00:25:55,293 --> 00:25:58,820
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow For
he's a jolly good fellow...</i>

332
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,524
<i>So we wouldn't run out, we
would spare the candles.</i>

333
00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:05,660
Queenie, you know I don't like
birthdays and I don't like cake.

334
00:26:06,371 --> 00:26:10,307
<i>And death was a common visitor.
People came and went.</i>

335
00:26:12,144 --> 00:26:14,544
<i>You always knew when
someone left us.</i>

336
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:17,137
<i>There was a silence
in the house.</i>

337
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:33,493
<i>It was a wonderful
place to grow up.</i>

338
00:26:33,598 --> 00:26:38,058
<i>I was with people who had shed all
the inconsequences of earlier life.</i>

339
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:42,866
<i>Left wondering about the weather,
the temperature of a bath,</i>

340
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:46,304
<i>the light at the end of a day.</i>

341
00:26:50,715 --> 00:26:54,674
<i>For everyone that died, someone
would come to take their place.</i>

342
00:26:55,754 --> 00:26:58,018
I've been married five times.

343
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:02,254
My fifth wife and I are captured
by a neighbor tribe of cannibals.

344
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,418
Oh, goodness gracious.

345
00:27:03,528 --> 00:27:04,995
We escaped across the river.

346
00:27:05,096 --> 00:27:08,463
My wife, she can't swim,
so, sadly, she eaten.

347
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:09,761
Oh, my God.

348
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:12,701
My second wife steps
on cobra and dies.

349
00:27:13,271 --> 00:27:16,035
It was very bad luck
to be married to me.

350
00:27:16,141 --> 00:27:19,167
That's Mr. Oti. He's an acquaintance
of an acquaintance of mine.

351
00:27:19,277 --> 00:27:21,370
- The next summer I'm captured...
- He's a Pygmy.

352
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,345
...with three others by
the Baschiele tribe.

353
00:27:23,448 --> 00:27:28,317
They trade us for pigs, shoes, and
beer to a very strange American man.

354
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:49,930
I hear you're not so
old as you're looking.

355
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,271
You just fooling everybody.

356
00:27:52,844 --> 00:27:55,870
<i>What's the matter? Did
you get Madjembe?</i>

357
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:57,346
<i>What's Madjembe?</i>

358
00:27:57,449 --> 00:27:58,746
Worms.

359
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,414
I don't think I have worms.

360
00:28:02,087 --> 00:28:03,611
This is just how I am.

361
00:28:03,722 --> 00:28:06,589
- Did you take your pills today?
- No, ma'am.

362
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:09,023
Come. Let's get a
cold root beer.

363
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:11,254
I found the medication
under your pillow.

364
00:28:11,363 --> 00:28:14,526
I'm not supposed to.
It's dangerous.

365
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:17,363
Who said that? Come
on, little man.

366
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,331
Hello, children.

367
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,073
Hold, please.

368
00:28:35,754 --> 00:28:40,054
Then I'm in the monkey house at
Philadelphia Zoological Park.

369
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:44,451
Three thousand people
show up my first day.

370
00:28:45,797 --> 00:28:46,786
Look.

371
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,500
What's it like living in a cage?

372
00:28:50,602 --> 00:28:52,069
It stinks.

373
00:28:52,704 --> 00:28:54,968
But the monkeys.

374
00:28:55,774 --> 00:28:57,799
They do some tricks there.

375
00:28:58,043 --> 00:29:00,739
I throw a spear,
wrestle with Kowali.

376
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,309
She is orangutan.

377
00:29:03,748 --> 00:29:07,275
When I'm not playing with the monkeys,
they want me to run to the bars

378
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:09,478
in my cage, with my teeth.

379
00:29:19,431 --> 00:29:21,490
So then what'd you do?

380
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,436
Then I leave zoo, go here, go there.
Wandered most of the time.

381
00:29:27,906 --> 00:29:28,930
You were all alone?

382
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,338
Plenty of time you'll be alone.

383
00:29:31,443 --> 00:29:34,879
When you're different like
us, it's gonna be that way.

384
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,747
But I'll tell you
a little secret.

385
00:29:39,851 --> 00:29:43,150
Fat people, skinny
people, tall people,

386
00:29:43,254 --> 00:29:46,246
white people, they're
just as alone as we are.

387
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:48,986
But they're scared shitless.

388
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,828
I think about the
river I grew up on.

389
00:29:58,303 --> 00:30:01,204
It would be nice to sit
by my river again.

390
00:30:03,475 --> 00:30:05,841
Come, I have an appointment.

391
00:30:08,246 --> 00:30:10,806
There's my little man.
You ready, sugar?

392
00:30:10,915 --> 00:30:13,247
Always ready. Always ready.

393
00:30:15,053 --> 00:30:17,146
Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.

394
00:30:18,189 --> 00:30:21,249
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- My pleasure, ma'am.

395
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:23,327
You can find your own
way home, can't you?

396
00:30:23,428 --> 00:30:26,158
Take the St. Charles
line to Napoleon.

397
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,762
Hey! Hey!

398
00:30:54,092 --> 00:30:57,584
Where in God's name have you been?
Get in here.

399
00:30:59,097 --> 00:31:02,362
I mean, you take my breath
away, you know that?

400
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:05,361
Oh, Lord, I was so
worried about you.

401
00:31:09,074 --> 00:31:11,634
<i>It had been the best
day of my life.</i>

402
00:31:12,577 --> 00:31:15,273
- How's her breathing?
- It's shallow.

403
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,904
They say it'll reach
us in a few hours,

404
00:31:17,015 --> 00:31:19,916
so I gotta get my baby and
take him to my sister's.

405
00:31:20,018 --> 00:31:22,486
They say there's nothing to worry
about here in the hospital.

406
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:25,078
Nurses'll be right here if you need them.
Are you okay?

407
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,921
- Yeah, I'm okay reading.
- I shouldn't be more than an hour.

408
00:31:30,328 --> 00:31:32,956
Was there just company?

409
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:35,931
It was just Dorothy leaving.

410
00:31:38,103 --> 00:31:39,536
Go on, Caroline.

411
00:31:39,637 --> 00:31:42,731
"On Sundays, the families
would come and visit."

412
00:31:43,141 --> 00:31:46,076
<i>it was Thanksgiving, 1930.</i>

413
00:31:46,177 --> 00:31:49,146
<i>I met the person who
changed my life forever.</i>

414
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:03,285
Well, Benjamin.

415
00:32:03,728 --> 00:32:07,027
Might I say you are looking
strikingly youthful.

416
00:32:07,499 --> 00:32:09,057
Good day, Mrs. Fuller.

417
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:12,432
A single cane, back
straight as an arrow.

418
00:32:12,537 --> 00:32:14,903
What elixir have
you been drinking?

419
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:18,373
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Grandma! Look at me!

420
00:32:20,812 --> 00:32:23,144
That was really something.

421
00:32:23,248 --> 00:32:25,113
Come on over here, you.

422
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,048
Now, this is my
granddaughter, Daisy.

423
00:32:28,987 --> 00:32:30,818
This is Mr...

424
00:32:30,955 --> 00:32:34,618
I'm afraid, Benjamin, I don't
rightly know your last name.

425
00:32:34,726 --> 00:32:36,353
Benjamin's fine.

426
00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:39,327
<i>I never forgot her blue eyes.</i>

427
00:32:39,764 --> 00:32:42,426
Good people, supper is served.

428
00:32:42,534 --> 00:32:48,632
Health and food, for love and friends.
For everything thy goodness sends.

429
00:32:49,073 --> 00:32:50,233
Amen.

430
00:32:50,341 --> 00:32:51,569
- Amen!
- Amen!

431
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,840
Did you know turkeys
aren't really birds?

432
00:32:57,949 --> 00:32:58,973
Why do you say that?

433
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:02,211
They're in the pheasant
family, can't hardly fly.

434
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,845
It's sad, don't you think?
Birds that can't fly?

435
00:33:04,956 --> 00:33:07,117
I love birds that can't fly.

436
00:33:07,225 --> 00:33:09,216
They are so delicious.

437
00:33:10,395 --> 00:33:12,863
- That's terrible.
- I have something to tell y'all

438
00:33:12,964 --> 00:33:16,127
while we're giving thanks
for God's blessings.

439
00:33:16,234 --> 00:33:18,168
I had a miracle happen.

440
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,298
The Lord saw fit to
answer my prayers.

441
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:27,307
What does she mean,
answered her prayers?

442
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:28,936
Thanks. Thank you.

443
00:33:29,047 --> 00:33:31,413
She's gonna have a baby, silly.

444
00:33:32,383 --> 00:33:35,375
That's what my mama said when I
was gonna have a baby brother,

445
00:33:35,486 --> 00:33:37,750
but he didn't live long,

446
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,322
'cause he didn't breathe right.

447
00:33:44,195 --> 00:33:48,188
"In the afternoon, when he had
got his beautiful hind legs"

448
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:51,894
"just as Big God
Nqong had promised."

449
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,965
"You can see that it is 5:00,"

450
00:33:55,073 --> 00:33:59,032
"because Big God Nqong's
clock says so."

451
00:33:59,143 --> 00:34:00,974
isn't that something?

452
00:34:01,546 --> 00:34:02,911
Again, read it again.

453
00:34:03,014 --> 00:34:05,312
Oh, read it again, please.

454
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:08,715
All right. But afterwards,
you must go to bed.

455
00:34:09,087 --> 00:34:10,486
I promise.

456
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:14,288
"Old Man Kangaroo."

457
00:34:18,596 --> 00:34:20,257
Are you sleeping?

458
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:23,289
Who's that?

459
00:34:23,401 --> 00:34:24,959
It's me, Daisy.

460
00:34:26,004 --> 00:34:27,471
Oh, hi!

461
00:34:28,072 --> 00:34:29,562
'Kay, come on.

462
00:34:40,718 --> 00:34:42,447
Where are we going?

463
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:46,419
Come on. Under here.

464
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:57,400
Here, you light it.

465
00:34:57,502 --> 00:34:59,595
I'm not supposed to
play with matches.

466
00:34:59,704 --> 00:35:01,968
Don't be a chicken. Light it.

467
00:35:13,084 --> 00:35:16,019
I'll tell you a secret
if you'll tell me one.

468
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,553
Okay.

469
00:35:17,655 --> 00:35:20,988
I saw my mama kissing
another man.

470
00:35:21,392 --> 00:35:23,451
Her face was red from it.

471
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,220
Your turn.

472
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:32,833
I'm not as old as I look.

473
00:35:32,937 --> 00:35:34,495
I thought so.

474
00:35:36,474 --> 00:35:38,908
You don't seem like
an old person.

475
00:35:39,577 --> 00:35:41,738
- Like my grandma.
- I'm not.

476
00:35:43,514 --> 00:35:45,106
Are you sick?

477
00:35:45,683 --> 00:35:48,846
Well, I heard Mama and
Tizzy whispering.

478
00:35:48,953 --> 00:35:53,117
They said I was gonna die
soon, but maybe not.

479
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,884
You're odd.

480
00:35:57,662 --> 00:36:00,529
You're different than
anybody I've ever met.

481
00:36:03,701 --> 00:36:05,862
- May I?
- Okay.

482
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:15,545
What are you doing under there?

483
00:36:15,646 --> 00:36:19,082
You come right out here
and get back up to bed!

484
00:36:19,183 --> 00:36:20,946
It's after midnight!

485
00:36:21,052 --> 00:36:23,145
You are not to be
playing together.

486
00:36:23,254 --> 00:36:24,778
Yes, ma'am.

487
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:27,050
Now you get back to
bed, little lady.

488
00:36:27,158 --> 00:36:31,117
You're too young to be wandering
around in the night on your own.

489
00:36:33,798 --> 00:36:37,632
And you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

490
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:54,976
You are a different child.

491
00:36:55,753 --> 00:36:56,845
A man-child.

492
00:36:56,954 --> 00:37:01,414
And, baby, people aren't gonna
understand just how different you are.

493
00:37:07,732 --> 00:37:09,893
What's wrong with me, Mama?

494
00:37:10,835 --> 00:37:12,598
Come here.

495
00:37:14,772 --> 00:37:17,002
God hasn't said yet, baby.

496
00:37:21,446 --> 00:37:24,938
Now go on to bed, hear?
And behave yourself.

497
00:37:26,284 --> 00:37:28,844
Go on. Say your prayers, hear?

498
00:37:40,665 --> 00:37:44,726
Did I ever tell you I've been
struck by lightning seven times?

499
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:49,972
Once when I was repairing
a leak on the roof.

500
00:37:54,078 --> 00:37:57,309
Once I was just crossing
the road to get the mail.

501
00:38:13,364 --> 00:38:14,661
<i>I never forgot her...</i>

502
00:38:14,765 --> 00:38:16,255
"...blue eyes."

503
00:38:17,735 --> 00:38:19,293
Mom?

504
00:38:19,403 --> 00:38:24,170
Did you get that this Benjamin loved you
from the first time that he saw you?

505
00:38:25,443 --> 00:38:27,877
Not many people experience that.

506
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,143
Want me to go on?

507
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:35,142
He crosses something out.

508
00:38:35,253 --> 00:38:38,552
<i>When that baby came,
things were different.</i>

509
00:38:38,656 --> 00:38:41,989
<i>Your mama gone away And
your daddy gonna stay</i>

510
00:38:42,093 --> 00:38:45,893
<i>Didn't leave nobody but the baby</i>

511
00:38:47,365 --> 00:38:49,959
<i>Babies were born, people died.</i>

512
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:53,701
<i>A lot of folks been
through that old house.</i>

513
00:38:55,673 --> 00:38:58,904
I've come to say goodbye.
I'm going away.

514
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,272
Going?

515
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:02,302
Where?

516
00:39:02,413 --> 00:39:03,971
I haven't figured that out yet,

517
00:39:04,081 --> 00:39:06,549
but I'll send you a
postcard when I get there.

518
00:39:06,651 --> 00:39:09,415
What about your friend,
the tall lady?

519
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,919
We are not friends anymore.

520
00:39:11,022 --> 00:39:14,287
That's what happens with
tall people sometimes.

521
00:39:14,392 --> 00:39:17,156
Well, goodbye.

522
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:39,211
<i>Spent a lot of time
by myself that year.</i>

523
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:41,813
Hello?

524
00:39:43,588 --> 00:39:45,351
- Hi.
- I'm moving in today.

525
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:48,289
Welcome. We've been
expecting you.

526
00:39:48,392 --> 00:39:51,418
Can you please show her up to Mrs.
Rousseau's old room?

527
00:39:51,529 --> 00:39:54,862
I'm sorry, but we usually don't
allow dogs in the house.

528
00:39:54,966 --> 00:39:57,958
Well, she's old as the hills.
She's almost blind.

529
00:39:58,069 --> 00:40:01,004
She won't be a
bother much longer.

530
00:40:01,105 --> 00:40:04,802
Well, all right, long as she
stays from up underfoot.

531
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:06,103
Right this way, ma'am.

532
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,338
<i>As hard as I try, I can't
remember her name.</i>

533
00:40:09,447 --> 00:40:12,575
<i>Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford.</i>

534
00:40:13,618 --> 00:40:15,381
<i>Maybe it was Maple.</i>

535
00:40:15,486 --> 00:40:17,818
<i>It's funny how sometimes the
people we remember the least</i>

536
00:40:17,922 --> 00:40:20,447
<i>make the greatest
impression on us.</i>

537
00:40:21,058 --> 00:40:23,390
<i>I do remember she wore diamonds.</i>

538
00:40:23,494 --> 00:40:27,294
<i>And she always dressed in fine
clothing, as if she was going out.</i>

539
00:40:27,398 --> 00:40:30,959
<i>Although she never did and
nobody ever came to visit her.</i>

540
00:40:32,703 --> 00:40:35,035
<i>She taught me to play the piano.</i>

541
00:40:40,411 --> 00:40:43,039
It's not about how
well you play.

542
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:46,614
It's how you feel about
what you're playing.

543
00:40:46,717 --> 00:40:48,048
Try this.

544
00:41:04,402 --> 00:41:07,633
You can't help putting
yourself in the music.

545
00:41:15,713 --> 00:41:17,704
<i>There were many changes.</i>

546
00:41:17,815 --> 00:41:20,875
<i>Some you could see,
some you couldn't.</i>

547
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:24,852
<i>Hair had started growing
in all sorts of places,</i>

548
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:27,357
<i>along with other things.</i>

549
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:31,389
<i>I felt pretty good, considering.</i>

550
00:41:32,463 --> 00:41:35,125
Darling, the pain.

551
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,757
All right, Mom,
I'll get the nurse.

552
00:41:40,304 --> 00:41:42,966
<i>Look at this eye. This
is a major hurricane,</i>

553
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:46,066
<i>a slow hurricane, with maximum
sustained winds of...</i>

554
00:41:46,177 --> 00:41:48,008
Not doing too good?

555
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:52,144
Nobody seems to know
whether to stay or leave.

556
00:41:52,249 --> 00:41:54,547
I'm gonna ride it out.

557
00:41:54,652 --> 00:41:57,519
There. That should make
things much easier.

558
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:04,155
Have you had a chance
to say your goodbyes?

559
00:42:04,261 --> 00:42:07,753
My father waited four hours for my
brother to get here from Boger City.

560
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:09,833
Couldn't go without him.

561
00:42:10,368 --> 00:42:13,030
- She seems like a sweet woman.
- Yeah.

562
00:42:13,704 --> 00:42:15,399
I haven't had as much time
with her as I would've...

563
00:42:15,506 --> 00:42:17,406
- You busy? I could use your help.
- Excuse me.

564
00:42:17,508 --> 00:42:18,736
Sure.

565
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,952
"Queenie would let me go with Mr.
Daws..."

566
00:42:39,063 --> 00:42:42,863
<i>...to Poverty Point to watch the
boats go up and down the river.</i>

567
00:42:42,967 --> 00:42:44,901
<i>These were hard times.</i>

568
00:42:47,938 --> 00:42:51,635
Did I ever tell you I was struck
by lightning seven times?

569
00:42:52,576 --> 00:42:55,977
Once when I was in the field,
just tending to my cows.

570
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,784
My fourth hand didn't show up.

571
00:43:07,024 --> 00:43:10,482
Anybody want to make $2 for
a day's work 'round here?

572
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:14,125
What's the matter?

573
00:43:14,231 --> 00:43:16,961
Nobody wants to do an honest day's
work for an honest day's pay?

574
00:43:17,101 --> 00:43:18,625
He never pays.

575
00:43:20,104 --> 00:43:22,402
- Nobody wants a job?
- I do.

576
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:26,874
You got your sea legs
about you, old man?

577
00:43:27,978 --> 00:43:29,343
I think.

578
00:43:33,317 --> 00:43:35,751
Well, that's good enough for me.

579
00:43:35,853 --> 00:43:39,311
Get your ass on board. We'll
sure as hell find out.

580
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:46,456
<i>I was as happy as I could be.</i>

581
00:43:46,564 --> 00:43:47,826
I need a volunteer!

582
00:43:47,932 --> 00:43:49,263
<i>I would do anything.</i>

583
00:43:49,366 --> 00:43:50,799
Yes, Captain!

584
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:53,199
Scrape off all this bird shit!

585
00:43:53,938 --> 00:43:55,633
Right away, sir.

586
00:43:56,474 --> 00:44:00,934
<i>And I was actually gonna be paid for
something I would've done for free.</i>

587
00:44:02,613 --> 00:44:04,945
<i>His name was Captain Mike Clark.</i>

588
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:08,851
<i>He'd been on a tugboat
since he was seven.</i>

589
00:44:09,887 --> 00:44:11,616
Get moving, then.

590
00:44:12,556 --> 00:44:14,046
Come here.

591
00:44:16,126 --> 00:44:19,220
Can you still get it up?

592
00:44:20,598 --> 00:44:22,589
I do every morning.

593
00:44:23,267 --> 00:44:26,668
The old pole, huh?
The high, hard one?

594
00:44:27,304 --> 00:44:28,601
I guess.

595
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:33,836
When was the last
time you had a woman?

596
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,280
- Never.
- Never?

597
00:44:38,782 --> 00:44:40,841
Not that I know of, sir.

598
00:44:41,352 --> 00:44:43,115
Wait a minute, now.

599
00:44:43,921 --> 00:44:48,051
You mean to say you've been on
this earth however many years

600
00:44:48,158 --> 00:44:51,423
and you've never had a woman?

601
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,160
Damn, that's the saddest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

602
00:45:00,638 --> 00:45:01,866
Never?

603
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,732
No.

604
00:45:06,377 --> 00:45:10,473
Well, then, by Jesus,
you are coming with me.

605
00:45:21,492 --> 00:45:23,084
What did your father do?

606
00:45:23,193 --> 00:45:25,218
I never met my father.

607
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:27,263
You lucky bastard.

608
00:45:28,165 --> 00:45:30,793
All fathers want to
do is hold you down.

609
00:45:33,437 --> 00:45:36,838
Out on my father's boat,
workin' the two-a-day,

610
00:45:37,174 --> 00:45:39,608
this little, fat bastard.

611
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,405
"Tug lrish, " they called him.

612
00:45:41,512 --> 00:45:44,879
Anyway, I finally work up
the nerve and tell him,

613
00:45:45,783 --> 00:45:49,480
"I don't want to spend the rest
of my life on a goddamn tugboat."

614
00:45:49,587 --> 00:45:51,555
You know what I'm saying?

615
00:45:51,956 --> 00:45:54,618
You don't want to spend the
rest of your life on a tugboat.

616
00:45:54,725 --> 00:45:57,023
Absolutely! Damn right!

617
00:45:59,797 --> 00:46:02,391
So you know what my
father says to me?

618
00:46:03,233 --> 00:46:07,670
He says, "Who the hell
do you think you are?"

619
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:10,501
"What the hell do you
think you can do?"

620
00:46:10,808 --> 00:46:12,469
So I tell him.

621
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:16,307
"Well, if you're asking,"

622
00:46:18,582 --> 00:46:20,607
"I want to be an artist."

623
00:46:21,185 --> 00:46:23,085
He laughs.

624
00:46:23,587 --> 00:46:28,581
"An artist? God meant for you to
work a tugboat, just like me."

625
00:46:28,692 --> 00:46:31,320
"And that's exactly
what you're gonna do."

626
00:46:31,428 --> 00:46:34,659
Well, I turned myself
into an artist.

627
00:46:37,134 --> 00:46:38,863
A tattoo artist!

628
00:46:41,305 --> 00:46:44,103
I put on every one
of these myself.

629
00:46:46,644 --> 00:46:50,444
You have to skin me alive to
take my art away from me now.

630
00:46:51,248 --> 00:46:54,740
When I'm dead, I'm
gonna send him my arm.

631
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,419
That one.

632
00:46:59,757 --> 00:47:02,385
Don't let anyone
tell you different.

633
00:47:02,493 --> 00:47:05,087
You gotta do what
you're meant to do.

634
00:47:05,195 --> 00:47:08,289
And I happen to be a
goddamned artist.

635
00:47:08,899 --> 00:47:11,197
But you're a tugboat captain.

636
00:47:11,802 --> 00:47:13,531
Captain Mike?

637
00:47:13,637 --> 00:47:16,367
We're ready for you
and your friend.

638
00:47:18,108 --> 00:47:21,134
Let's go, old timer, eh?
Break your cherry.

639
00:47:22,346 --> 00:47:25,042
- Hello, my lovelies!
- Hey, Captain.

640
00:47:25,182 --> 00:47:26,149
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi.

641
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:29,410
- Hi.
- Hi.

642
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,546
He gives me the willies.
That is not for me.

643
00:47:34,491 --> 00:47:36,755
How are you tonight, grandpa?

644
00:47:37,428 --> 00:47:39,555
<i>It was a night to remember.</i>

645
00:47:45,302 --> 00:47:48,965
What are you, Dick Tracy or something?
I've got to rest.

646
00:47:50,107 --> 00:47:51,335
Again.

647
00:47:52,643 --> 00:47:54,975
- Thank you.
- No, thank you. You have a nice night.

648
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:57,206
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- Every night but Sunday.

649
00:47:57,314 --> 00:48:01,011
<i>It sure made me understand the
value of earning a living.</i>

650
00:48:01,652 --> 00:48:03,483
Good night, sweetie.
Come back now.

651
00:48:03,587 --> 00:48:05,782
<i>Things money can buy you.</i>

652
00:48:23,474 --> 00:48:25,135
It's nasty out.

653
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:28,510
Can I offer you a
ride somewhere?

654
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,544
Well, that's awfully
kind of you, sir.

655
00:48:41,892 --> 00:48:44,360
My name is Thomas,
Thomas Button.

656
00:48:45,028 --> 00:48:47,121
- I'm Benjamin.
- Benjamin.

657
00:48:48,398 --> 00:48:50,525
It's a pleasure to know you.

658
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:55,300
Would you like to stop
somewhere and have a drink?

659
00:48:55,405 --> 00:48:56,770
All right.

660
00:48:58,075 --> 00:49:00,339
Evening, Mr. Button.

661
00:49:04,915 --> 00:49:06,849
What'll it be, sir?

662
00:49:07,584 --> 00:49:10,610
- I'll have whatever he's having.
- Sazerac for the both of us.

663
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:13,087
With whiskey, not brandy.

664
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,680
You don't drink, do you?

665
00:49:14,792 --> 00:49:17,386
- It's a night for firsts.
- How's that?

666
00:49:17,494 --> 00:49:19,553
I've never been to
a brothel, either.

667
00:49:19,663 --> 00:49:22,427
Well, it's an experience.

668
00:49:22,566 --> 00:49:25,660
It certainly is. There's
a time for everything.

669
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:28,169
- True enough.
- Your drinks.

670
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:35,039
I don't mean to be rude, but your hands.
Is that painful?

671
00:49:35,379 --> 00:49:38,007
Well, I was born with
some form of disease.

672
00:49:38,115 --> 00:49:39,673
What kind of disease?

673
00:49:39,783 --> 00:49:41,512
I was born old.

674
00:49:43,053 --> 00:49:44,748
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be.

675
00:49:44,855 --> 00:49:47,380
There's nothing
wrong with old age.

676
00:49:56,266 --> 00:49:59,292
My wife passed away
many years ago.

677
00:50:00,704 --> 00:50:02,535
I'm so, so sorry.

678
00:50:04,007 --> 00:50:05,872
She died in childbirth.

679
00:50:09,379 --> 00:50:11,904
- To children.
- To mothers.

680
00:50:16,753 --> 00:50:19,017
What line of work you in, Mr.
Button?

681
00:50:19,122 --> 00:50:23,252
Buttons. Button's Buttons. There
isn't a button that we don't make.

682
00:50:25,462 --> 00:50:27,828
Our biggest competition is B.F.
Goodrich

683
00:50:27,931 --> 00:50:29,660
and his infernal zippers.

684
00:50:29,766 --> 00:50:32,564
Would you gentlemen
like anything else?

685
00:50:32,669 --> 00:50:34,694
One for the road, Benjamin?

686
00:50:34,805 --> 00:50:37,638
Only if you let me pay for it, Mr.
Button.

687
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:41,377
So, what line of work do you do?

688
00:50:42,813 --> 00:50:45,247
I'm a tugboat man.

689
00:50:51,455 --> 00:50:53,480
I enjoyed talking to you.

690
00:50:53,957 --> 00:50:56,084
I enjoyed drinking with you.

691
00:50:59,696 --> 00:51:01,095
Benjamin?

692
00:51:01,198 --> 00:51:04,634
Would you mind if, time to time,
I stopped by and said hello?

693
00:51:04,735 --> 00:51:08,136
Anytime. Good night, Mr. Button.

694
00:51:08,672 --> 00:51:10,435
Good night, Benjamin.

695
00:51:11,174 --> 00:51:12,539
Drive on.

696
00:51:18,215 --> 00:51:19,546
Where have you been?

697
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:24,644
Nothing. I met some people
and listened to some music.

698
00:51:27,424 --> 00:51:29,619
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!

699
00:51:30,627 --> 00:51:33,721
<i>Growing up's a funny thing.
Sneaks up on you.</i>

700
00:51:34,665 --> 00:51:38,999
<i>One person is there, then suddenly
somebody else has taken her place.</i>

701
00:51:39,603 --> 00:51:41,264
<i>She wasn't all elbows
and knees anymore.</i>

702
00:51:41,371 --> 00:51:43,066
Benjamin! Come on!

703
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,805
Okay.

704
00:51:46,076 --> 00:51:47,634
<i>I loved those weekends
when she'd come</i>

705
00:51:47,744 --> 00:51:50,542
<i>and spend the night
with her grandmother.</i>

706
00:51:58,622 --> 00:52:01,090
Daisy. Daisy.

707
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:04,419
You want to see something?

708
00:52:05,595 --> 00:52:10,362
You gotta keep it a secret, so get dressed.
I'll meet you out back.

709
00:52:15,906 --> 00:52:17,271
Come on.

710
00:52:19,076 --> 00:52:22,204
- Can you swim?
- I can do anything you can do.

711
00:52:22,312 --> 00:52:24,906
Here, put this on.
We gotta hurry.

712
00:52:37,861 --> 00:52:39,385
Is he okay?

713
00:52:39,496 --> 00:52:40,929
Captain?

714
00:52:42,566 --> 00:52:44,056
Captain Mike?

715
00:52:47,804 --> 00:52:50,500
Morning, Captain. Can
you take us out?

716
00:52:51,675 --> 00:52:53,973
Do you know what day it is?

717
00:52:54,077 --> 00:52:55,339
Sunday?

718
00:52:55,445 --> 00:52:57,572
Do you know what that means?

719
00:52:58,915 --> 00:53:01,315
Means I was very
drunk last night.

720
00:53:01,918 --> 00:53:04,182
Well, you're drunk every night.

721
00:53:06,656 --> 00:53:08,920
- Is that a girl?
- Close friend.

722
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:10,751
I want to show her the river.

723
00:53:10,861 --> 00:53:14,160
You're not supposed to go
joyriding with civilians.

724
00:53:15,332 --> 00:53:17,459
I could lose my license.

725
00:53:27,277 --> 00:53:28,744
What are you waiting for?

726
00:53:58,942 --> 00:54:02,036
Pulled in for repair
a wounded duck.

727
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,607
She's flying now, huh?

728
00:54:06,149 --> 00:54:07,776
Ahoy, sailor!

729
00:54:12,355 --> 00:54:14,687
I wish we could go with them.

730
00:54:20,697 --> 00:54:22,961
Did you say something, Mom?

731
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,708
It's getting really bad.

732
00:54:34,744 --> 00:54:36,507
Can you hear me, Mom?

733
00:54:39,149 --> 00:54:41,811
Time just seeped out of me.

734
00:54:48,592 --> 00:54:50,389
"Things were changing quickly."

735
00:54:50,494 --> 00:54:54,590
I don't know how it's possible,
but you seem to have more hair.

736
00:54:56,133 --> 00:54:59,102
What if I told you that
I wasn't getting older,

737
00:54:59,202 --> 00:55:02,501
but I was getting younger
than everybody else?

738
00:55:02,606 --> 00:55:06,508
Well, I'd feel sorry for you,

739
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:09,443
to have to see everybody you
love die before you do.

740
00:55:09,546 --> 00:55:11,446
It's an awful responsibility.

741
00:55:11,548 --> 00:55:15,109
<i>I'd never thought about life
or death that way before.</i>

742
00:55:16,753 --> 00:55:20,814
Benjamin, we're meant to
lose the people we love.

743
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:24,658
How else would we know how
important they are to us?

744
00:55:27,764 --> 00:55:32,224
<i>And one fall day, a familiar
visitor came knocking on our door.</i>

745
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:36,768
You want to go with
me to the drugstore?

746
00:55:46,917 --> 00:55:49,283
<i>She taught me how
to play the piano.</i>

747
00:55:49,386 --> 00:55:50,648
- Amen.
- Amen.

748
00:55:50,754 --> 00:55:53,917
<i>And she taught me what it
meant to miss somebody.</i>

749
00:55:58,495 --> 00:55:59,928
Let's go.

750
00:56:00,964 --> 00:56:02,898
<i>I had gone to a brothel.</i>

751
00:56:02,999 --> 00:56:05,297
<i>I'd had my first drink.</i>

752
00:56:05,402 --> 00:56:08,860
<i>Said goodbye to one friend
and buried another.</i>

753
00:56:09,406 --> 00:56:14,275
<i>In 1936, when I was coming to the
end of the 17th year of my life,</i>

754
00:56:14,377 --> 00:56:17,210
<i>I packed my bag, said goodbye.</i>

755
00:56:17,314 --> 00:56:19,646
- Bye, Benjamin.
- Goodbye.

756
00:56:19,749 --> 00:56:24,209
<i>I knew, life being what it was, I'd
probably never see them again.</i>

757
00:56:26,423 --> 00:56:28,050
Bye, Mr. Benjamin.

758
00:56:28,158 --> 00:56:30,626
- Good luck to you, son.
- Thank you.

759
00:56:35,165 --> 00:56:38,066
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you, too, baby.

760
00:56:39,269 --> 00:56:42,500
I want you to say your
prayers every night, hear?

761
00:56:47,377 --> 00:56:49,402
Be safe, hear?

762
00:57:00,824 --> 00:57:02,189
Benjamin!

763
00:57:05,295 --> 00:57:07,923
- Where you going?
- To sea.

764
00:57:09,332 --> 00:57:11,391
I'll send you a postcard.

765
00:57:13,236 --> 00:57:15,170
From everywhere.

766
00:57:15,272 --> 00:57:17,866
Write me a postcard
from everywhere.

767
00:57:32,389 --> 00:57:34,254
Can you imagine?

768
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:42,758
He sent me a postcard
from everywhere he went.

769
00:57:44,334 --> 00:57:46,302
Every place he worked.

770
00:57:47,637 --> 00:57:50,697
Newfoundland. Baffin Bay.

771
00:57:51,308 --> 00:57:54,368
Glasgow. Liverpool. Narvik.

772
00:57:55,178 --> 00:57:59,911
He had gone with
that Captain Mike.

773
00:58:01,951 --> 00:58:04,181
<i>Captain Mike had
contracted for three years</i>

774
00:58:04,287 --> 00:58:06,585
<i>with Moran Brothers
Tug and Salvage.</i>

775
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:10,558
<i>The old ship had been refitted with a
diesel engine and a new sea winch.</i>

776
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,561
<i>We went around Florida and
up the Atlantic seaboard.</i>

777
00:58:13,663 --> 00:58:17,064
<i>We were a crew of seven now.
Captain Mike and me.</i>

778
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:20,500
<i>Cookie, Prentiss Mayes
from Wilmington, Delaware.</i>

779
00:58:20,603 --> 00:58:23,003
<i>The Brody twins, Rick and Vic,</i>

780
00:58:23,106 --> 00:58:25,336
<i>who got along fine at sea
but, for some reason,</i>

781
00:58:25,442 --> 00:58:28,502
<i>once they were on dry land couldn't
stand the sight of each other.</i>

782
00:58:28,611 --> 00:58:32,172
You know, one in every
eight boats never returns.

783
00:58:32,282 --> 00:58:34,409
<i>There was John Grimm,
who sure fit his name.</i>

784
00:58:34,517 --> 00:58:36,348
All hands lost at sea.

785
00:58:36,453 --> 00:58:38,683
<i>From Belvedere, South Dakota.</i>

786
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:42,923
<i>And Pleasant Curtis
from Asheville, Notch.</i>

787
00:58:43,026 --> 00:58:46,189
<i>Never said a word to
anyone, except himself.</i>

788
00:58:48,298 --> 00:58:48,598
I wrote him constantly.

789
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:51,192
I wrote him constantly.

790
00:58:52,836 --> 00:58:57,830
<i>I told him I had been invited
to audition in New York City</i>

791
00:58:58,408 --> 00:59:01,070
<i>for the School of
American Ballet.</i>

792
00:59:01,177 --> 00:59:02,576
Please stay.

793
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:04,806
Thank you. Thank you.

794
00:59:06,783 --> 00:59:08,045
You can stay.

795
00:59:10,553 --> 00:59:13,613
<i>But I was relegated
to the corps.</i>

796
00:59:13,957 --> 00:59:16,323
<i>Another dancing gypsy.</i>

797
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,154
Benjamin!

798
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,267
How is it when you showed up

799
00:59:25,368 --> 00:59:29,236
you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave,

800
00:59:29,339 --> 00:59:33,537
but now, either I drink a hell
of a lot more than I think I do,

801
00:59:34,811 --> 00:59:36,438
or you sprouted?

802
00:59:37,347 --> 00:59:39,110
What's your secret?

803
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,108
Well, Captain,

804
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,717
you do drink a lot.

805
00:59:50,527 --> 00:59:54,793
<i>We stayed in a small hotel with a
grand name, The Winter Palace.</i>

806
00:59:54,898 --> 00:59:57,662
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

807
00:59:57,767 --> 01:00:01,225
The hummingbird is not
just another bird.

808
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:05,668
Its heart rate's 1,200
beats per minute.

809
01:00:07,444 --> 01:00:10,140
Its wings beat 80
times a second.

810
01:00:12,081 --> 01:00:15,073
If you was to stop their
wings from beating,

811
01:00:15,718 --> 01:00:18,551
it would be dead in
less than 10 seconds.

812
01:00:19,556 --> 01:00:22,218
This is no ordinary bird.

813
01:00:22,892 --> 01:00:24,985
This is a frickin' miracle.

814
01:00:28,164 --> 01:00:32,066
They slowed down their wings
with moving pictures,

815
01:00:32,735 --> 01:00:34,930
and you know what they saw?

816
01:00:35,438 --> 01:00:38,236
Their wingtips are doing that.

817
01:00:42,278 --> 01:00:46,112
You know what the figure eight
is the mathematical symbol for?

818
01:00:49,118 --> 01:00:50,642
Infinity.

819
01:00:50,753 --> 01:00:52,084
Infinity!

820
01:00:55,592 --> 01:00:58,493
<i>Everybody, no matter what
differences they had,</i>

821
01:00:58,595 --> 01:01:02,622
<i>the languages, the color of their
skin, had one thing in common.</i>

822
01:01:03,566 --> 01:01:05,932
<i>They were drunk
every single night.</i>

823
01:01:06,035 --> 01:01:07,559
Three, please.

824
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:09,262
Could you hold, dear,
for us, please?

825
01:01:09,372 --> 01:01:11,636
Thank you very much.
Good evening.

826
01:01:11,741 --> 01:01:14,437
<i>Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.</i>

827
01:01:14,544 --> 01:01:17,843
<i>She was not beautiful.
She was plain as paper.</i>

828
01:01:17,947 --> 01:01:20,745
<i>But she was pretty as
any picture to me.</i>

829
01:01:22,051 --> 01:01:24,076
What are you looking at?

830
01:01:26,322 --> 01:01:28,847
If you must know, we have
a longstanding agreement

831
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:30,323
never to go to bed sober.

832
01:01:30,426 --> 01:01:32,826
- Isn't that right, darling?
- Whatever you say, darling.

833
01:01:32,929 --> 01:01:34,988
<i>Her husband was Walter Abbott.</i>

834
01:01:35,098 --> 01:01:39,000
<i>He was Chief Minister of the
British Trade Mission in Murmansk,</i>

835
01:01:39,102 --> 01:01:40,729
<i>and he was a spy.</i>

836
01:01:40,837 --> 01:01:43,704
- Darling.
- Oh, thank you, my darling.

837
01:01:43,806 --> 01:01:45,831
- Key, darling.
- Oh, yes.

838
01:01:50,346 --> 01:01:53,372
I broke my heel off
one of my shoes.

839
01:01:53,483 --> 01:01:57,078
I'm not in the habit of walking
about in my stocking feet.

840
01:02:01,491 --> 01:02:03,652
<i>They were long days there.</i>

841
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:13,135
<i>And even longer nights.</i>

842
01:02:15,338 --> 01:02:18,899
<i>One particular night, I was
having trouble sleeping.</i>

843
01:02:20,343 --> 01:02:21,867
I'm sorry.

844
01:02:23,746 --> 01:02:25,475
I couldn't sleep.

845
01:02:38,394 --> 01:02:41,852
I was gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

846
01:02:42,765 --> 01:02:44,596
Oh, no. Thank you.

847
01:03:22,438 --> 01:03:23,996
Milk? Honey?

848
01:03:24,641 --> 01:03:26,575
A bit of honey, please.

849
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:28,873
I hope you like flies
in your honey.

850
01:03:28,978 --> 01:03:30,639
Oh, perhaps not.

851
01:03:45,495 --> 01:03:49,727
Oh, maybe better to let
it steep a little.

852
01:03:50,733 --> 01:03:51,927
Steep?

853
01:03:52,301 --> 01:03:53,359
Soak.

854
01:03:53,636 --> 01:03:57,299
I don't know, I mean, there's
a proper way of making tea.

855
01:03:57,407 --> 01:04:00,638
Well, where I'm from, people
just want it to be hot.

856
01:04:00,743 --> 01:04:02,836
Well, quite right.

857
01:04:11,754 --> 01:04:14,154
- Now, you're a seaman.
- A sailor.

858
01:04:14,257 --> 01:04:16,987
I hope you won't think me
impolite, but I have to ask,

859
01:04:17,093 --> 01:04:19,220
aren't you a little old
to be working on a boat?

860
01:04:19,328 --> 01:04:22,729
There's no age limit, as
long as you can do the work.

861
01:04:33,543 --> 01:04:35,841
And you have trouble sleeping?
Thank you.

862
01:04:35,945 --> 01:04:39,142
I didn't think I did. I
usually sleep like a baby.

863
01:04:40,116 --> 01:04:42,550
Something's been keeping me up.

864
01:04:43,786 --> 01:04:44,980
My father, in his 80s,

865
01:04:45,088 --> 01:04:48,353
he was so convinced he was
gonna die in his sleep,

866
01:04:48,991 --> 01:04:52,119
he limited himself to
having afternoon naps.

867
01:04:52,895 --> 01:04:55,659
He was so determined he
was gonna cheat death.

868
01:04:56,833 --> 01:04:58,698
- Did he?
- Did he what?

869
01:04:58,835 --> 01:05:00,462
Die in his sleep?

870
01:05:02,171 --> 01:05:04,765
He died sitting in
his favorite chair

871
01:05:04,874 --> 01:05:07,502
listening to his favorite
program on the wireless.

872
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:10,078
He must have known something.

873
01:05:15,818 --> 01:05:20,881
My husband's the British Trade Minister,
and we've been here for 14 months.

874
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:24,323
- Good God.
- We were supposed to go to Peking

875
01:05:24,427 --> 01:05:27,885
but it never seemed to work out.

876
01:05:29,365 --> 01:05:31,060
Have you been in the Far East?

877
01:05:31,167 --> 01:05:33,362
No. I've never been
anywhere, really.

878
01:05:33,469 --> 01:05:35,903
I mean, outside of harbors.

879
01:05:36,005 --> 01:05:37,666
And where is it
that you're from?

880
01:05:37,774 --> 01:05:40,265
New Orleans. Louisiana.

881
01:05:41,778 --> 01:05:44,076
I didn't know there was another.

882
01:05:46,382 --> 01:05:51,410
<i>And she told me about all the places
she had been, and what she had seen.</i>

883
01:05:53,022 --> 01:05:55,923
<i>And we talked till
just before the dawn.</i>

884
01:05:56,959 --> 01:05:58,426
I'm just a lush, myself.

885
01:05:58,528 --> 01:06:03,465
<i>And we went back to our
rooms, to our separate lives.</i>

886
01:06:08,905 --> 01:06:12,204
<i>But every night, we'd
meet again in that lobby.</i>

887
01:06:17,547 --> 01:06:21,449
<i>A hotel in the middle of the
night can be a magical place.</i>

888
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,221
<i>A mouse running, and stopping.</i>

889
01:06:28,658 --> 01:06:30,751
<i>A radiator hissing.</i>

890
01:06:31,761 --> 01:06:33,626
<i>A curtain blowing.</i>

891
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,767
<i>There's something
peaceful, even comforting</i>

892
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:44,101
<i>knowing that the people you
love are asleep in their beds</i>

893
01:06:44,207 --> 01:06:46,437
<i>where nothing can harm them.</i>

894
01:06:49,545 --> 01:06:52,480
<i>Elizabeth and I would
lose track of the night</i>

895
01:06:53,015 --> 01:06:55,176
<i>until just before daybreak.</i>

896
01:06:57,787 --> 01:07:00,585
I think I may have given
you the wrong impression.

897
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:02,214
Beg pardon?

898
01:07:02,325 --> 01:07:06,125
Well, married women don't
customarily sit around

899
01:07:06,229 --> 01:07:08,254
in the middle of the night
with strange men in hotels.

900
01:07:08,364 --> 01:07:11,891
I wouldn't know what a married
woman does or doesn't do.

901
01:07:17,673 --> 01:07:19,106
Good night.

902
01:07:21,444 --> 01:07:22,741
Murmansk.

903
01:07:25,381 --> 01:07:28,441
"I've met somebody, and
I've fallen in love."

904
01:07:28,551 --> 01:07:29,745
Mom?

905
01:07:33,589 --> 01:07:36,114
That was over 60 years ago.

906
01:07:37,426 --> 01:07:38,450
Did you love him, Mother?

907
01:07:38,561 --> 01:07:41,325
What does a girl
know about love?

908
01:08:14,931 --> 01:08:16,125
Well...

909
01:08:18,634 --> 01:08:22,400
- I'm not dressed.
- Oh, you look splendid, just as you are.

910
01:08:24,674 --> 01:08:27,734
Don't waste any time bothering about
the wine or the cheese in Murmansk,

911
01:08:27,843 --> 01:08:30,869
'cause they're really
completely ordinary,

912
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:35,940
but the caviar and the vodka

913
01:08:36,519 --> 01:08:40,615
are sublime and plentiful.

914
01:08:44,427 --> 01:08:45,689
So.

915
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,297
Savor it.

916
01:08:54,437 --> 01:08:56,405
And don't eat it all at once,

917
01:08:56,505 --> 01:08:59,599
because that way, there's
nothing left to enjoy.

918
01:09:01,277 --> 01:09:05,611
And now, take a little swallow of
vodka while it's still in your mouth.

919
01:09:20,496 --> 01:09:23,329
You haven't been with
many women, have you?

920
01:09:24,533 --> 01:09:26,160
Not on Sundays.

921
01:09:28,371 --> 01:09:30,100
And you've never had
caviar before, have you?

922
01:09:30,206 --> 01:09:31,833
No, ma'am.

923
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,341
When I was 19,

924
01:09:40,349 --> 01:09:46,618
I attempted to become the first woman
ever to swim the English Channel.

925
01:09:47,623 --> 01:09:49,022
Really?

926
01:09:49,658 --> 01:09:52,684
But the current that day
was so strong that,

927
01:09:52,795 --> 01:09:55,889
for every stroke I took,
I was pushed back two.

928
01:09:56,499 --> 01:09:59,093
<i>I was in the water for 32 hours.</i>

929
01:10:00,069 --> 01:10:03,903
And when I was two
miles from Calais,

930
01:10:05,041 --> 01:10:06,770
<i>it started to rain.</i>

931
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:09,410
That's it! Steady on!

932
01:10:09,945 --> 01:10:12,573
<i>When I couldn't go any further,</i>

933
01:10:14,183 --> 01:10:15,616
I stopped.

934
01:10:17,019 --> 01:10:18,611
<i>I just stopped.</i>

935
01:10:19,221 --> 01:10:24,090
And everybody asked me,
would I try again?

936
01:10:24,827 --> 01:10:26,692
<i>For why wouldn't I?</i>

937
01:10:29,598 --> 01:10:31,293
But I never did.

938
01:10:32,735 --> 01:10:36,967
As a matter of fact, I've never done
anything with my life after that.

939
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:43,135
Your hands are so coarse.

940
01:10:53,489 --> 01:10:56,049
I can feel the wind
in your cheek.

941
01:11:02,832 --> 01:11:05,323
I'm afraid it's the
witching hour.

942
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,471
<i>It was the first time a
woman had ever kissed me.</i>

943
01:11:15,044 --> 01:11:17,444
<i>It's something you never forget.</i>

944
01:11:27,957 --> 01:11:29,982
I think you make
me feel younger.

945
01:11:30,092 --> 01:11:32,617
You make me feel
years younger, too.

946
01:11:32,728 --> 01:11:34,320
I wish I was.

947
01:11:35,331 --> 01:11:37,458
So many things I'd change.

948
01:11:38,167 --> 01:11:40,499
I'd undo all my mistakes.

949
01:11:40,603 --> 01:11:42,298
What mistakes?

950
01:11:45,641 --> 01:11:47,802
I kept waiting, you know?

951
01:11:48,444 --> 01:11:52,938
Thinking that I'd do something
to change my circumstances.

952
01:11:54,216 --> 01:11:55,945
Do something.

953
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,751
Such an awful waste.
You never get it back.

954
01:12:01,223 --> 01:12:02,690
Wasted time.

955
01:12:08,998 --> 01:12:11,398
If we're going to
have an affair,

956
01:12:12,134 --> 01:12:14,967
you're never to look
at me during the day.

957
01:12:15,604 --> 01:12:18,539
And we're always to
part before sunrise.

958
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:21,836
And we will never
say "I love you."

959
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:25,276
Those are the rules.

960
01:12:27,883 --> 01:12:30,044
- Are you cold?
- I'm freezing.

961
01:12:30,152 --> 01:12:32,086
Oh, you! You're frozen.

962
01:12:32,188 --> 01:12:35,385
What an idiot, I'm standing here in
this fur. How thoughtless of me.

963
01:13:09,058 --> 01:13:11,856
<i>She was the first woman
that ever loved me.</i>

964
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:16,058
You want me to skip some?

965
01:13:16,165 --> 01:13:21,933
No, I'm glad he had
somebody to keep him warm.

966
01:13:25,608 --> 01:13:28,076
"I couldn't wait
to see her again."

967
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:43,288
<i>We saw each other every night.</i>

968
01:13:43,892 --> 01:13:46,190
<i>We always used the same room.</i>

969
01:13:48,163 --> 01:13:51,496
<i>But each time seemed
new and different.</i>

970
01:13:52,901 --> 01:13:54,334
Come here.

971
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:03,209
Elizabeth.

972
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:05,979
Good night.

973
01:14:08,684 --> 01:14:10,311
<i>Until one night.</i>

974
01:14:47,589 --> 01:14:53,186
<i>Yesterday, December 7th, 1941,</i>

975
01:14:53,295 --> 01:14:56,389
<i>a date which will
live in infamy...</i>

976
01:14:56,498 --> 01:15:00,628
it's a meeting, a policy
meeting regarding your future,

977
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:03,128
possibly beyond.

978
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:07,100
There's been a change
of plan, lads.

979
01:15:07,309 --> 01:15:09,903
As you may or may not know,

980
01:15:10,012 --> 01:15:12,606
the Japs bombed Pearl
Harbor yesterday.

981
01:15:13,048 --> 01:15:16,506
Frank D. Roosevelt's asked
each of us to do our part.

982
01:15:17,019 --> 01:15:21,115
<i>The Chelsea's been commissioned to
serve in the United States Navy.</i>

983
01:15:21,557 --> 01:15:24,822
To repair, to salvage,
and to rescue.

984
01:15:26,362 --> 01:15:30,696
Anybody doesn't want to go to
war, now is the time to say so.

985
01:15:30,799 --> 01:15:34,997
Once you set foot on that boat,
you're in the Navy, friend.

986
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,266
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk with you, Mike.

987
01:15:41,377 --> 01:15:43,368
My wife's doing poorly.

988
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:46,209
I'd like to maybe see
her one more time.

989
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:51,750
You're free to make your way
home any way you can, Mr. Mayes.

990
01:15:57,393 --> 01:15:59,156
Well, if he's leaving,
who's gonna cook?

991
01:15:59,261 --> 01:16:03,322
Food poisoning's one of the
leading causes of death at sea.

992
01:16:03,432 --> 01:16:05,798
Right after inadequate
safety equipment.

993
01:16:05,901 --> 01:16:08,529
I can cook, Captain. Been
doing it all my life.

994
01:16:08,637 --> 01:16:13,040
I don't know. You're a little
moody for war, Benjamin.

995
01:16:13,142 --> 01:16:15,110
What the hell?

996
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:19,544
I'll take any man wants to kick the
shite out of the Japs and the Huns.

997
01:16:20,949 --> 01:16:24,715
That's it, pack your gear.
We're going to war, gentlemen!

998
01:16:31,593 --> 01:16:33,356
<i>She had left a note.</i>

999
01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:37,460
<i>She wrote, "it was
nice to have met you."</i>

1000
01:16:38,233 --> 01:16:39,825
<i>And that was it.</i>

1001
01:16:43,071 --> 01:16:46,131
<i>It wasn't the war
any of us expected.</i>

1002
01:16:46,241 --> 01:16:49,870
<i>We would just tow crippled
ships, scraps of metal, really.</i>

1003
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:53,448
<i>If there was a war,
we didn't see it.</i>

1004
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:59,411
<i>There was a man assigned to us.
The Chief Gunner loved the Navy.</i>

1005
01:16:59,521 --> 01:17:01,716
<i>But most of all,
he loved America.</i>

1006
01:17:01,824 --> 01:17:04,725
There is no other
country in the world.

1007
01:17:04,827 --> 01:17:05,919
When you spell America...

1008
01:17:06,028 --> 01:17:10,192
<i>His name was Dennis Smith, and
he was a full-blooded Cherokee.</i>

1009
01:17:10,299 --> 01:17:13,393
<i>His family had been Americans
for over 500 years.</i>

1010
01:17:13,502 --> 01:17:18,030
These pacifists. They say they
won't fight on conscience.

1011
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:21,735
Now, where would be if
everybody decided to act

1012
01:17:21,844 --> 01:17:25,803
- according to their conscience?
- Keep it down, would you, Chief?

1013
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:45,400
Hey. I've been watching you.

1014
01:17:46,568 --> 01:17:48,365
You seem trustworthy.

1015
01:17:50,172 --> 01:17:52,265
If something happens to me,

1016
01:17:56,345 --> 01:17:58,905
could you see that
this gets to my wife?

1017
01:17:59,014 --> 01:18:03,542
<i>He'd given me all of his pay.
Hadn't spent a dime of it.</i>

1018
01:18:05,454 --> 01:18:08,719
I want my family to know I
was thinking about them.

1019
01:18:13,495 --> 01:18:15,326
All hands on deck!

1020
01:18:41,924 --> 01:18:44,119
<i>The war had finally found us.</i>

1021
01:18:46,828 --> 01:18:48,295
All stop!

1022
01:18:51,033 --> 01:18:53,024
Pleasant, man that light.

1023
01:19:00,909 --> 01:19:05,073
<i>A transport carrying 1,300 men
had been split by a torpedo.</i>

1024
01:19:07,482 --> 01:19:09,746
<i>We were first to
arrive at the scene.</i>

1025
01:19:09,851 --> 01:19:13,412
- Cut the engines!
- All stop!

1026
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,460
<i>We were the only sound.</i>

1027
01:19:34,409 --> 01:19:35,808
Fellas!

1028
01:19:45,787 --> 01:19:46,845
Sub!

1029
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:54,458
We sure as hell can't
outrun them fuckers.

1030
01:19:56,198 --> 01:19:58,496
Battle stations!

1031
01:20:08,377 --> 01:20:09,366
Thank you, Chief.

1032
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,772
What?

1033
01:20:25,761 --> 01:20:27,558
Is that the last one?

1034
01:21:49,177 --> 01:21:50,405
Captain!

1035
01:22:06,061 --> 01:22:08,689
They shot the hell
out of my painting!

1036
01:22:09,965 --> 01:22:11,796
Give me your other hand.

1037
01:22:17,172 --> 01:22:18,196
You'll be all right, Captain.

1038
01:22:18,306 --> 01:22:22,572
They got a nice spot in Heaven
waiting for you. Nice spot.

1039
01:22:24,112 --> 01:22:27,138
You can be as mad as a mad
dog at the way things went.

1040
01:22:30,152 --> 01:22:33,815
You could swear,
curse the Fates.

1041
01:22:36,124 --> 01:22:38,251
But when it comes to the end,

1042
01:22:40,462 --> 01:22:42,191
you have to let go.

1043
01:22:49,204 --> 01:22:50,432
Captain?

1044
01:23:11,293 --> 01:23:14,592
<i>Thirteen hundred and twenty
eight men died that day.</i>

1045
01:23:16,898 --> 01:23:20,129
<i>I said my goodbyes to the
Cherokee, Dennis Smith.</i>

1046
01:23:21,102 --> 01:23:24,299
<i>John Grimm, who was right,
he was gonna die there.</i>

1047
01:23:25,807 --> 01:23:28,503
<i>I sent Pleasant Curtis'
wife his money.</i>

1048
01:23:29,344 --> 01:23:32,404
<i>I said goodbye to the
twin, Vic Brody,</i>

1049
01:23:32,514 --> 01:23:37,178
<i>and to Mike Clark, captain
of the tugboat Chelsea.</i>

1050
01:23:39,654 --> 01:23:44,114
<i>I said goodbye to all the other
men who had dreams of their own,</i>

1051
01:23:44,226 --> 01:23:46,786
<i>all the men who wanted
to be insurance salesmen</i>

1052
01:23:46,895 --> 01:23:49,830
<i>or doctors or lawyers
or lndian chiefs.</i>

1053
01:23:50,899 --> 01:23:52,696
This don't get fixed.

1054
01:23:54,803 --> 01:23:57,863
<i>Out here, death
didn't seem natural.</i>

1055
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:18,053
<i>I'd never seen a hummingbird
that far out to sea.</i>

1056
01:24:19,594 --> 01:24:21,186
<i>Before or since.</i>

1057
01:24:27,217 --> 01:24:33,452
<i>And in May of 1945, when
I was 26 years old,</i>

1058
01:24:33,557 --> 01:24:34,658
<i>I came home.</i>

1059
01:24:35,559 --> 01:24:38,153
I'm ready! I'm ready!

1060
01:24:38,261 --> 01:24:39,626
I'm coming!

1061
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:44,159
- I'm ready!
- All right, I'm coming, Miss Alfalina.

1062
01:24:44,267 --> 01:24:45,757
- Queenie?
- Yes?

1063
01:24:51,641 --> 01:24:57,546
Sweet Jesus! Oh, you're home!
Oh, Lord, you came back!

1064
01:24:58,448 --> 01:25:00,382
- Let me look at you.
- Who's that, Mama?

1065
01:25:00,484 --> 01:25:03,749
- Child, it's your brother, Benjamin.
- I didn't know he was my brother.

1066
01:25:03,854 --> 01:25:05,515
There's a shitload of things
you don't know, child.

1067
01:25:05,622 --> 01:25:06,782
Get on out there and
finish sweeping.

1068
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:09,051
Come here, wash your hands, help
me with the table. Go on, now.

1069
01:25:09,159 --> 01:25:13,061
Turn around. You look like
you've been born again.

1070
01:25:13,163 --> 01:25:15,427
Younger than the springtime.

1071
01:25:15,532 --> 01:25:19,161
I think that preacher laid hands
on you gave you a second life.

1072
01:25:19,269 --> 01:25:22,898
I knew it that moment I saw
you, you were special.

1073
01:25:23,006 --> 01:25:24,871
I tell you what,
my knees are sore,

1074
01:25:24,975 --> 01:25:27,500
'cause I've been on them
every night asking the Lord,

1075
01:25:27,611 --> 01:25:31,342
I said, "God, just bring
him home safely."

1076
01:25:31,448 --> 01:25:33,939
Remember what I told you?

1077
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:35,677
"You never know what's
coming for you"?

1078
01:25:35,786 --> 01:25:37,686
That's right. Sit down.

1079
01:25:39,089 --> 01:25:43,185
Well, you learn anything
worth repeating?

1080
01:25:45,295 --> 01:25:49,527
- I sure saw some things.
- Oh, you seen some pain.

1081
01:25:51,034 --> 01:25:53,798
- Some joy, too?
- Sure. Sure, I did.

1082
01:25:53,904 --> 01:25:58,034
Yeah, that's what I want to hear.
Look at you.

1083
01:25:58,141 --> 01:26:01,633
- Where's Tizzy?
- Oh, baby.

1084
01:26:04,114 --> 01:26:07,982
Mr. Weathers died in his
sleep one night last April.

1085
01:26:08,084 --> 01:26:11,542
- Mama, I'm so sorry.
- Don't you worry about that, baby.

1086
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:15,918
Yeah, well, it's only one
or two of them left now.

1087
01:26:16,026 --> 01:26:17,493
They all just about new.

1088
01:26:17,594 --> 01:26:21,496
Guess they're waiting their
turn like everybody else, huh?

1089
01:26:21,598 --> 01:26:24,328
I'm so glad you're
back home with me!

1090
01:26:24,434 --> 01:26:27,562
Now, we're gonna have to find you a
wife and a new job! That's right.

1091
01:26:27,671 --> 01:26:29,536
Come on in here, help
me with this table.

1092
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:34,301
Benjamin.

1093
01:26:34,411 --> 01:26:37,539
You're wasting your time, baby.
She's stone deaf.

1094
01:26:37,647 --> 01:26:41,674
Oh, and you'll be staying in what was Mrs.
DeSeroux's old room.

1095
01:26:41,785 --> 01:26:44,686
You're too big to be
rooming with anybody else.

1096
01:26:48,825 --> 01:26:51,419
<i>It's a funny thing
about coming home.</i>

1097
01:26:52,095 --> 01:26:55,861
<i>Looks the same, smells the
same, feels the same.</i>

1098
01:26:58,635 --> 01:27:02,469
Did I ever tell you I've been
struck by lightning seven times?

1099
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:07,507
Once when I was sitting in my truck,
just minding my own business.

1100
01:27:13,383 --> 01:27:16,819
<i>You realize what's
changed is you.</i>

1101
01:27:19,489 --> 01:27:23,516
<i>And late one morning, not
long after I'd been back...</i>

1102
01:27:23,927 --> 01:27:25,258
Thank you.

1103
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:48,408
Hey.

1104
01:27:52,989 --> 01:27:56,857
- Excuse me, is Queenie here?
- Daisy?

1105
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:04,225
- It's me, Benjamin.
- Benjamin?

1106
01:28:07,971 --> 01:28:09,939
Oh, my God!

1107
01:28:11,241 --> 01:28:15,143
Of course it's you! Benjamin!

1108
01:28:17,247 --> 01:28:20,114
How are you? It's been
such a long time.

1109
01:28:20,216 --> 01:28:22,946
There's so much I want to know.
When did you get back?

1110
01:28:23,053 --> 01:28:24,452
Well, I got back
a few weeks ago.

1111
01:28:24,554 --> 01:28:28,547
I spoke to Queenie, she said you
were in the war, somewhere at sea.

1112
01:28:28,658 --> 01:28:32,389
- We were so, so worried about you.
- Oh, I'm okay.

1113
01:28:32,495 --> 01:28:36,363
Well, look at you.
You're so lovely.

1114
01:28:38,168 --> 01:28:39,931
You stopped writing.

1115
01:28:42,038 --> 01:28:47,135
"When I had left, she was a girl.
And a woman had taken her place."

1116
01:28:47,477 --> 01:28:50,640
"She was the most beautiful
woman I'd ever seen."

1117
01:28:50,747 --> 01:28:52,078
Beautiful.

1118
01:28:54,284 --> 01:28:56,081
"The most beautiful."

1119
01:28:57,887 --> 01:28:59,616
- You remember Grandma Fuller?
- Why, sure I do.

1120
01:28:59,723 --> 01:29:02,783
- She passed.
- I heard that. I'm sorry.

1121
01:29:02,892 --> 01:29:07,488
I just can't believe we're both here.
Must be fate.

1122
01:29:07,597 --> 01:29:09,565
No, no, what do they call it?

1123
01:29:09,666 --> 01:29:11,065
Kismet.

1124
01:29:11,167 --> 01:29:13,067
Do you know about Edgar
Cayce, the psychic?

1125
01:29:13,169 --> 01:29:14,158
I don't believe I...

1126
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:17,137
He says that everything
is predetermined,

1127
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:20,573
but I like to think
of it as fate.

1128
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:27,045
I'm not sure how it works,
but I'm glad it happened.

1129
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:30,745
Have you been to Manhattan? It's
right across the river from me.

1130
01:29:30,854 --> 01:29:32,981
Now, I can see the
Empire State Building

1131
01:29:33,089 --> 01:29:34,852
if I stand on my bed.

1132
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:36,949
What about you? Where
have you been?

1133
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:40,655
Tell me everything. Last time you
wrote, you said you'd been to Russia.

1134
01:29:40,764 --> 01:29:44,928
I've always wanted to go to Russia.
Is it as cold as they say?

1135
01:29:45,035 --> 01:29:47,799
- Twice as cold.
- My goodness.

1136
01:29:48,405 --> 01:29:53,069
We always said you were different.
But I think you really are.

1137
01:29:55,178 --> 01:29:58,705
You wrote that you met somebody.
Did it work out?

1138
01:29:59,215 --> 01:30:00,876
It ran its course.

1139
01:30:02,252 --> 01:30:04,277
Hey, do you remember this?

1140
01:30:15,198 --> 01:30:17,894
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo"

1141
01:30:18,001 --> 01:30:20,094
"at 5:00 in the afternoon."

1142
01:30:21,938 --> 01:30:24,133
Would you like to have dinner?

1143
01:30:31,648 --> 01:30:34,549
<i>Did I tell you that I
danced for Balanchine?</i>

1144
01:30:35,251 --> 01:30:39,745
<i>Oh, he's a famous choreographer.
He said that I had perfect line.</i>

1145
01:30:41,491 --> 01:30:46,019
<i>You know, in a rehearsal
once, a dancer fell.</i>

1146
01:30:46,129 --> 01:30:48,927
<i>And he just... He just put it
right into the production.</i>

1147
01:30:49,032 --> 01:30:52,524
<i>I mean, can you imagine that? Like in a...
In a classical ballet?</i>

1148
01:30:52,635 --> 01:30:55,866
<i>You know, a dancer,
intentionally falling.</i>

1149
01:30:55,972 --> 01:30:59,601
<i>There's a whole new word for dance now.
It's called "abstract."</i>

1150
01:30:59,709 --> 01:31:01,040
<i>No, he's not the
only one, though.</i>

1151
01:31:01,144 --> 01:31:05,046
<i>There's Lincoln Kirstein and
Lucia Chase, and oh, my...</i>

1152
01:31:05,148 --> 01:31:07,639
<i>Oh, there's Agnes de Mille.</i>

1153
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:09,809
<i>She's just torn up all
those conventions,</i>

1154
01:31:09,919 --> 01:31:11,887
<i>you know, all that
straight-up-and-down stuff.</i>

1155
01:31:11,988 --> 01:31:15,185
<i>It's not about the formality of the dance,
it's about what the dancer's feeling.</i>

1156
01:31:15,291 --> 01:31:17,987
<i>As she told me about
this big new world,</i>

1157
01:31:18,094 --> 01:31:20,585
<i>names that didn't
mean a thing to me,</i>

1158
01:31:20,697 --> 01:31:22,756
<i>I didn't really hear very
much of what she was saying.</i>

1159
01:31:22,866 --> 01:31:25,096
<i>It's new and it's modern
and it's American.</i>

1160
01:31:25,201 --> 01:31:28,364
They understand our vigor
and our physicality.

1161
01:31:28,471 --> 01:31:30,598
Oh, my God. I've just
been talking and talking.

1162
01:31:30,773 --> 01:31:35,210
No, no, I've enjoyed listening.
I didn't know you smoked.

1163
01:31:35,311 --> 01:31:36,835
I'm old enough.

1164
01:31:40,216 --> 01:31:42,707
I'm old enough for
a lot of things.

1165
01:31:45,655 --> 01:31:48,089
In New York, we
stay up all night,

1166
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:52,157
watch the sun come up
over the warehouses.

1167
01:31:54,497 --> 01:31:56,795
There's always something to do.

1168
01:32:14,484 --> 01:32:16,577
I have to go back tomorrow.

1169
01:32:17,754 --> 01:32:19,881
- So soon.
- Wish I could stay.

1170
01:32:24,694 --> 01:32:27,857
Dancers don't need costumes
or scenery anymore.

1171
01:32:27,964 --> 01:32:31,491
I can imagine dancing
completely naked.

1172
01:32:32,802 --> 01:32:35,168
Have you read D.H. Lawrence?

1173
01:32:35,271 --> 01:32:37,364
- Well...
- His books were banned.

1174
01:32:37,473 --> 01:32:41,000
The words are like making love.

1175
01:33:25,555 --> 01:33:30,151
In our company, we have
to trust each other.

1176
01:33:35,465 --> 01:33:39,128
Sex is a part of it.

1177
01:33:43,539 --> 01:33:46,440
You know, a lot of the
dancers are lesbians.

1178
01:33:48,578 --> 01:33:51,672
There was one woman who
wanted to sleep with me.

1179
01:33:58,988 --> 01:34:01,980
- Does that upset you?
- Which part?

1180
01:34:03,092 --> 01:34:05,526
Somebody wanting
to sleep with me.

1181
01:34:06,062 --> 01:34:07,222
You're a desirable woman.

1182
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:11,061
I would think most of them
would want to sleep with you.

1183
01:34:11,167 --> 01:34:13,226
Let's go back to the house.

1184
01:34:14,203 --> 01:34:16,603
Or we could get a
room somewhere.

1185
01:34:19,575 --> 01:34:22,772
- We could lay down your jacket.
- I don't know, Daisy.

1186
01:34:22,879 --> 01:34:28,215
It's not that I wouldn't like to or
anything. I think I'll just disappoint you.

1187
01:34:29,152 --> 01:34:32,212
Oh, Benjamin, I've
been with older men.

1188
01:34:33,022 --> 01:34:35,013
You're going back to New
York in the morning.

1189
01:34:35,124 --> 01:34:37,456
You should be with your friends.

1190
01:34:38,461 --> 01:34:40,952
- You're only young once.
- Oh, I'm old enough.

1191
01:34:41,064 --> 01:34:43,658
Daisy, just not tonight, is all.

1192
01:34:57,213 --> 01:34:59,340
We could go hear some music.

1193
01:35:01,617 --> 01:35:04,313
<i>Our lives are defined
by opportunities.</i>

1194
01:35:05,154 --> 01:35:07,145
<i>Even the ones we miss.</i>

1195
01:35:08,024 --> 01:35:11,653
You look so handsome
and so distinguished.

1196
01:35:11,761 --> 01:35:13,922
They're saying the hurricane's
gonna miss us, blow right on by.

1197
01:35:14,030 --> 01:35:18,626
- Oh, that's great.
- I'll stay under the blankets with Mother.

1198
01:35:18,735 --> 01:35:22,796
She says nothing... Benjamin?

1199
01:35:24,741 --> 01:35:25,799
"Things were becoming
different..."

1200
01:35:25,908 --> 01:35:27,068
<i>...for me.</i>

1201
01:35:27,176 --> 01:35:30,771
<i>My hair had very little
gray and grew like weeds.</i>

1202
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:34,646
<i>My sense of smell was keener.
My hearing, more acute.</i>

1203
01:35:34,751 --> 01:35:37,379
<i>I could walk further and faster.</i>

1204
01:35:37,487 --> 01:35:43,255
<i>While everybody else was aging, I
was getting younger, all alone.</i>

1205
01:35:46,295 --> 01:35:47,523
Come in.

1206
01:35:48,931 --> 01:35:50,228
Benjamin.

1207
01:35:51,234 --> 01:35:54,431
- Do you remember me?
- Well, sure I do, Mr. Button.

1208
01:35:55,138 --> 01:35:58,699
- What happened to you?
- Darn foot. Got infected, so...

1209
01:36:00,376 --> 01:36:01,604
Welcome home, my friend.

1210
01:36:04,313 --> 01:36:07,407
I see you're still drinking
your Sazerac with whiskey.

1211
01:36:07,517 --> 01:36:08,745
Creature of habit.

1212
01:36:08,851 --> 01:36:10,944
You still visiting the
house on Bourbon Street?

1213
01:36:11,053 --> 01:36:12,782
Not for a long time.

1214
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:16,483
Interesting times, though.

1215
01:36:16,592 --> 01:36:21,029
We went from making 40,000 to nearly
half a million buttons a day.

1216
01:36:21,130 --> 01:36:23,121
We employed 10 times
the number of people.

1217
01:36:23,232 --> 01:36:25,723
We were operating
around the clock.

1218
01:36:30,306 --> 01:36:31,671
Damn shame.

1219
01:36:32,809 --> 01:36:35,744
The war has been kind
to the button industry.

1220
01:36:38,481 --> 01:36:39,812
You know,

1221
01:36:42,084 --> 01:36:45,417
I'm sick. I don't know
how much longer I have.

1222
01:36:45,521 --> 01:36:48,354
- I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Button.
- No...

1223
01:36:49,759 --> 01:36:52,819
I don't have any people.
I keep to myself.

1224
01:36:55,331 --> 01:36:58,323
I hope you don't mind,
but, whenever possible,

1225
01:36:58,434 --> 01:37:00,425
I'd enjoy your company.

1226
01:37:00,536 --> 01:37:03,027
I'll certainly do what I can.

1227
01:37:06,342 --> 01:37:09,243
Benjamin, do you know
anything about buttons?

1228
01:37:12,849 --> 01:37:17,479
Now, Button's Buttons has been
in our family for 124 years.

1229
01:37:18,154 --> 01:37:22,750
My grandfather was a tailor, and
he had a small shop in Richmond.

1230
01:37:22,859 --> 01:37:25,259
After the Civil War, he
moved to New Orleans,

1231
01:37:25,361 --> 01:37:30,389
where my father had the wisdom
to make our own buttons.

1232
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:35,369
So, with his help, the
tailor shop grew to this.

1233
01:37:36,105 --> 01:37:38,699
And today, I can't sew a stitch.

1234
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:45,244
That's very, very interesting.

1235
01:37:48,718 --> 01:37:51,312
You sure have done
well for yourself.

1236
01:37:52,255 --> 01:37:56,316
So, what can I do for you, Mr.
Button?

1237
01:37:58,861 --> 01:38:01,853
Benjamin? You're my son.

1238
01:38:09,405 --> 01:38:12,033
I'm so sorry I never
told you before.

1239
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:17,577
You were born the night
the Great War ended.

1240
01:38:19,482 --> 01:38:23,179
Your mother died
giving birth to you.

1241
01:38:24,687 --> 01:38:26,882
I thought you were a monster.

1242
01:38:30,459 --> 01:38:33,724
I promised your mother I'd
make sure you were safe.

1243
01:38:40,169 --> 01:38:42,603
I should never have
abandoned you.

1244
01:38:46,742 --> 01:38:48,073
My mother?

1245
01:38:49,445 --> 01:38:52,380
At the summer house on
Lake Pontchartrain.

1246
01:38:52,481 --> 01:38:55,917
When I was a boy, I'd love to
wake up before anyone else,

1247
01:38:56,018 --> 01:38:59,010
run down to that lake and
watch the day begin.

1248
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:03,318
It was as if I was
the only one alive.

1249
01:39:05,161 --> 01:39:07,857
I fell in love the
first time I saw her.

1250
01:39:08,431 --> 01:39:11,059
Your mother's name
was Caroline Murphy.

1251
01:39:11,701 --> 01:39:14,568
She worked in your
grandfather's kitchen.

1252
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,501
She's from Dublin.

1253
01:39:20,176 --> 01:39:24,579
In 1903, Caroline and all her brothers
and sisters came to live here,

1254
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:26,204
in New Orleans.

1255
01:39:28,351 --> 01:39:31,184
I'd find excuses to go
down to that kitchen

1256
01:39:32,021 --> 01:39:34,148
just so I could look at her.

1257
01:39:40,529 --> 01:39:44,260
April 25th, 1918.
Happiest day of my life.

1258
01:39:45,034 --> 01:39:47,264
The day I married your mother.

1259
01:39:49,005 --> 01:39:51,132
Why didn't you just tell me?

1260
01:39:52,008 --> 01:39:54,841
I plan on leaving
everything I have to you.

1261
01:39:56,379 --> 01:39:58,813
- I have to go.
- Where?

1262
01:39:59,882 --> 01:40:01,247
Home.

1263
01:40:01,951 --> 01:40:03,282
And what does he think, anyway?

1264
01:40:03,386 --> 01:40:04,683
He thinks he can just show up

1265
01:40:04,787 --> 01:40:06,652
and everything's supposed
to be fine and dandy.

1266
01:40:06,756 --> 01:40:09,350
Everybody's just
supposed to be friends.

1267
01:40:09,458 --> 01:40:12,359
Well, he got another thing
coming, that's for sure.

1268
01:40:12,461 --> 01:40:15,862
God be my witness, he got
another thing coming.

1269
01:40:15,965 --> 01:40:19,025
He left us $18 that
night you was found.

1270
01:40:19,135 --> 01:40:20,966
Eighteen ratty dollars

1271
01:40:21,070 --> 01:40:22,765
- and a filthy diaper.
- Good night, Mama.

1272
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:25,334
Good night, baby.

1273
01:40:38,621 --> 01:40:42,955
Did I ever tell you I was struck
by lightning seven times?

1274
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:46,785
Once, I was walking
my dog down the road.

1275
01:40:51,801 --> 01:40:55,635
I'm blind in the one
eye, can't hardly hear,

1276
01:40:56,906 --> 01:41:01,502
get twitches and shakes out of nowhere,
always losing my line of thought.

1277
01:41:03,079 --> 01:41:04,740
But you know what?

1278
01:41:05,514 --> 01:41:08,449
God keeps reminding me
I'm lucky to be alive.

1279
01:41:14,223 --> 01:41:15,747
Storm's coming.

1280
01:41:43,686 --> 01:41:45,916
May I help you, sir? Up the
stairs, first bedroom.

1281
01:41:46,021 --> 01:41:47,079
Thank you.

1282
01:42:02,972 --> 01:42:04,200
Wake up.

1283
01:42:06,742 --> 01:42:08,607
Let's get you dressed.

1284
01:42:36,038 --> 01:42:37,665
Now that's something.

1285
01:42:40,976 --> 01:42:42,307
Thank you.

1286
01:43:42,471 --> 01:43:46,430
<i>You can be mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.</i>

1287
01:43:46,542 --> 01:43:48,942
<i>You can swear and
curse the Fates.</i>

1288
01:43:50,546 --> 01:43:52,741
<i>But when it comes to the end,</i>

1289
01:43:53,983 --> 01:43:55,712
<i>you have to let go.</i>

1290
01:44:17,706 --> 01:44:20,300
Well, it sure is a
beautiful service.

1291
01:44:22,177 --> 01:44:24,975
He'll be buried right
next to your mother.

1292
01:44:26,448 --> 01:44:28,075
You're my mother.

1293
01:44:31,921 --> 01:44:33,149
My baby.

1294
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,887
<i>Now, I'd never seen New York.</i>

1295
01:46:08,083 --> 01:46:11,450
- Excuse me, I'm a friend of Daisy's.
- Right this way.

1296
01:46:12,521 --> 01:46:17,857
- Daisy has company. Daisy! Daisy!
- Yes!

1297
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:21,525
- We need the wardrobe.
- Is somebody looking for me?

1298
01:46:24,133 --> 01:46:24,833
- Benjamin.
- Hi.

1299
01:46:24,834 --> 01:46:26,323
- Benjamin.
- Hi.

1300
01:46:27,636 --> 01:46:31,402
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd come visit.

1301
01:46:31,507 --> 01:46:34,965
Spend some time with
you, if I could.

1302
01:46:35,077 --> 01:46:40,947
Oh, well, I wish you would've called.
You took me by surprise.

1303
01:46:42,317 --> 01:46:46,447
- You can just throw them out.
- No. Thank you, they're lovely.

1304
01:46:47,089 --> 01:46:51,890
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.
I thought you were mesmerizing.

1305
01:46:53,929 --> 01:46:56,727
Thank you. That's very
kind of you to say.

1306
01:47:02,071 --> 01:47:04,096
I better get changed. A group
of us are going to a party.

1307
01:47:04,206 --> 01:47:07,471
- Would you want to come?
- Someone told me about a restaurant

1308
01:47:07,576 --> 01:47:08,838
I thought you might enjoy.

1309
01:47:08,944 --> 01:47:11,435
I made a reservation,
just in case.

1310
01:47:11,547 --> 01:47:14,539
Just, all the dancers go out
after the show. You're...

1311
01:47:14,650 --> 01:47:18,450
You're welcome to come with us.
I'll get changed. All right?

1312
01:47:24,927 --> 01:47:27,020
She choreographs for
the Ballets Russes.

1313
01:47:27,129 --> 01:47:28,426
She's divine.

1314
01:47:29,064 --> 01:47:30,895
You were breathtaking.

1315
01:47:36,605 --> 01:47:37,833
Sweetie.

1316
01:47:39,007 --> 01:47:41,874
This is David. He dances
with the company.

1317
01:47:42,878 --> 01:47:44,903
- This is Benjamin.
- Who?

1318
01:47:45,013 --> 01:47:48,244
- I told you about him.
- Oh, yeah. How you doing?

1319
01:47:48,350 --> 01:47:51,808
- I'll go get you a drink.
- All right. Thanks.

1320
01:47:59,528 --> 01:48:02,691
So, you were a friend
of her grandmother's?

1321
01:48:02,798 --> 01:48:04,698
Or something like that?

1322
01:48:05,868 --> 01:48:07,631
Something like that.

1323
01:48:07,970 --> 01:48:09,494
Hey, excuse me.

1324
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:33,088
Come on.

1325
01:48:54,449 --> 01:48:55,507
Hey!

1326
01:48:56,485 --> 01:48:58,976
Now, I had no idea
you were coming.

1327
01:49:00,022 --> 01:49:01,546
Lord, Benjamin.

1328
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:08,027
What did you expect? What, you
want me to drop everything?

1329
01:49:08,130 --> 01:49:10,098
Now, this is my life.

1330
01:49:10,199 --> 01:49:12,633
Babe! You going downtown?

1331
01:49:17,606 --> 01:49:20,700
Come on. You'll
have a good time.

1332
01:49:21,577 --> 01:49:23,067
There's lots of musicians,
interesting people.

1333
01:49:23,178 --> 01:49:26,079
You don't have to do that.
This is my fault.

1334
01:49:27,182 --> 01:49:28,615
I should've called.

1335
01:49:28,717 --> 01:49:31,515
I thought I'd come here

1336
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:34,350
and sweep you off your
feet or something.

1337
01:49:35,857 --> 01:49:40,317
- Daisy! Come on! Let's go.
- Be right there.

1338
01:49:42,130 --> 01:49:43,495
Seems nice.

1339
01:49:44,866 --> 01:49:46,458
Do you love him?

1340
01:49:49,605 --> 01:49:50,970
I think so.

1341
01:49:53,108 --> 01:49:54,769
I'm happy for you.

1342
01:49:56,712 --> 01:49:58,805
Maybe I'll see you at home.

1343
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:02,542
Okay.

1344
01:50:04,586 --> 01:50:06,315
I enjoyed the show!

1345
01:50:13,962 --> 01:50:18,456
He came to tell me
his father had died.

1346
01:50:19,968 --> 01:50:26,134
- You couldn't have known.
- I was 23. I... l just didn't care.

1347
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:30,075
What did you do next?

1348
01:50:30,178 --> 01:50:37,107
Some photographs, I think,
in the front of my bag.

1349
01:50:39,221 --> 01:50:43,317
I was as good a dancer
as I was ever gonna be.

1350
01:50:45,227 --> 01:50:47,161
For five years, I...

1351
01:50:49,931 --> 01:50:51,694
I danced everywhere.

1352
01:50:53,168 --> 01:50:56,660
London, Vienna, Prague.

1353
01:50:57,272 --> 01:50:59,137
I've never seen these.

1354
01:51:02,477 --> 01:51:03,535
Mom.

1355
01:51:04,846 --> 01:51:07,542
You never talked
about your dancing.

1356
01:51:07,649 --> 01:51:09,640
Well, I was the only American

1357
01:51:09,751 --> 01:51:14,688
to be invited to dance
with the Bolshoi, sugar.

1358
01:51:16,558 --> 01:51:18,549
<i>It was glorious.</i>

1359
01:51:23,031 --> 01:51:26,728
<i>But Benjamin was never
far from my thoughts.</i>

1360
01:51:29,905 --> 01:51:33,466
<i>And I'd find myself saying...</i>

1361
01:51:33,575 --> 01:51:35,372
Good night, Benjamin.

1362
01:51:37,379 --> 01:51:41,008
- "Good night, Daisy."
- He said that?

1363
01:51:43,185 --> 01:51:44,345
"Life wasn't all
that complicated."

1364
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:47,984
<i>"if you want, you might say I
was looking for something."</i>

1365
01:51:57,466 --> 01:52:00,435
Benjamin? Mrs. La
Tourneau just passed.

1366
01:52:06,842 --> 01:52:10,505
- Letter for Mr. Benjamin Button?
- That'd be me.

1367
01:52:13,415 --> 01:52:14,746
Thank you.

1368
01:52:41,076 --> 01:52:42,976
Miss Daisy Fuller.

1369
01:52:43,078 --> 01:52:45,876
- Just a minute. Please have a seat.
- Sure.

1370
01:52:53,355 --> 01:52:57,758
<i>Sometimes we're on a collision
course and we just don't know it.</i>

1371
01:52:58,326 --> 01:53:02,820
<i>Whether it's by accident or by design,
there's not a thing we can do about it.</i>

1372
01:53:05,667 --> 01:53:08,727
<i>A woman in Paris was on
her way to go shopping.</i>

1373
01:53:10,071 --> 01:53:13,837
<i>But she had forgotten her
coat, went back to get it.</i>

1374
01:53:13,942 --> 01:53:16,103
<i>When she had gotten her
coat, the phone had rung.</i>

1375
01:53:16,211 --> 01:53:19,203
<i>So she had stopped to answer it and
talked for a couple of minutes.</i>

1376
01:53:20,715 --> 01:53:22,512
<i>While the woman
was on the phone,</i>

1377
01:53:22,617 --> 01:53:26,781
<i>Daisy was rehearsing for a performance
at the Paris Opera House.</i>

1378
01:53:26,888 --> 01:53:29,652
<i>And while she was rehearsing,
the woman, off the phone now,</i>

1379
01:53:29,758 --> 01:53:32,056
<i>had gone outside to get a taxi.</i>

1380
01:53:36,598 --> 01:53:38,896
<i>Now, a taxi driver had
dropped off a fare earlier,</i>

1381
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,696
<i>and had stopped to
get a cup of coffee.</i>

1382
01:53:42,604 --> 01:53:45,334
<i>And all the while,
Daisy was rehearsing.</i>

1383
01:53:48,877 --> 01:53:49,077
<i>And this cab driver, who
dropped off the earlier fare</i>

1384
01:53:49,078 --> 01:53:51,375
<i>And this cab driver, who
dropped off the earlier fare</i>

1385
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:53,448
<i>and had stopped to get
the cup of coffee,</i>

1386
01:53:53,548 --> 01:53:55,243
<i>he picked up the lady
who was going shopping</i>

1387
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:58,046
<i>and had missed getting
the earlier cab.</i>

1388
01:53:59,020 --> 01:54:01,420
<i>The taxi had to stop for a
man crossing the street,</i>

1389
01:54:01,523 --> 01:54:04,321
<i>who had left for work five minutes
later than he normally did</i>

1390
01:54:04,426 --> 01:54:06,917
<i>because he forgot
to set his alarm.</i>

1391
01:54:07,729 --> 01:54:10,994
<i>While that man, late for work,
was crossing the street,</i>

1392
01:54:11,099 --> 01:54:14,535
<i>Daisy had finished rehearsing
and was taking a shower.</i>

1393
01:54:15,070 --> 01:54:16,367
<i>And while Daisy was showering,</i>

1394
01:54:16,471 --> 01:54:20,100
<i>the taxi was waiting outside a boutique
for the woman to pick up a package</i>

1395
01:54:20,208 --> 01:54:21,300
<i>which hadn't been wrapped yet,</i>

1396
01:54:21,409 --> 01:54:23,206
<i>because the girl who was
supposed to wrap it</i>

1397
01:54:23,311 --> 01:54:26,906
<i>had broken up with her boyfriend
the night before and forgot.</i>

1398
01:54:27,582 --> 01:54:30,779
<i>When the package was wrapped, the
woman, who was back in the cab,</i>

1399
01:54:30,886 --> 01:54:32,513
<i>was blocked by a delivery truck.</i>

1400
01:54:32,621 --> 01:54:35,351
<i>All the while, Daisy
was getting dressed.</i>

1401
01:54:36,858 --> 01:54:40,225
<i>The delivery truck pulled away,
and the taxi was able to move</i>

1402
01:54:40,328 --> 01:54:42,421
<i>while Daisy, the
last to be dressed,</i>

1403
01:54:42,531 --> 01:54:46,058
<i>waited for one of her friends
who had broken a shoelace.</i>

1404
01:54:46,501 --> 01:54:49,436
<i>While the taxi was stopped,
waiting for a traffic light,</i>

1405
01:54:49,538 --> 01:54:53,440
<i>Daisy and her friend came out
the back of the theater.</i>

1406
01:54:53,542 --> 01:54:56,909
<i>And if only one thing had
happened differently,</i>

1407
01:54:57,012 --> 01:54:59,105
<i>if that shoelace hadn't broken</i>

1408
01:54:59,214 --> 01:55:01,705
<i>or that delivery truck had
moved moments earlier</i>

1409
01:55:01,816 --> 01:55:03,681
<i>or that package had
been wrapped and ready</i>

1410
01:55:03,785 --> 01:55:06,515
<i>because the girl hadn't
broken up with her boyfriend,</i>

1411
01:55:06,621 --> 01:55:10,284
<i>or that man had set his alarm
and got up five minutes earlier</i>

1412
01:55:10,392 --> 01:55:13,555
<i>or that taxi driver hadn't
stopped for a cup of coffee</i>

1413
01:55:13,662 --> 01:55:17,655
<i>or that woman had remembered her
coat and got into an earlier cab,</i>

1414
01:55:18,233 --> 01:55:20,895
<i>Daisy and her friend would
have crossed the street</i>

1415
01:55:21,002 --> 01:55:23,436
<i>and the taxi would
have driven by.</i>

1416
01:55:34,516 --> 01:55:36,245
<i>But, life being what it is,</i>

1417
01:55:36,351 --> 01:55:39,343
<i>a series of intersecting
lives and incidents</i>

1418
01:55:39,454 --> 01:55:41,217
<i>out of anyone's control,</i>

1419
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:44,786
<i>that taxi did not go by,</i>

1420
01:55:44,893 --> 01:55:47,726
<i>and that driver was
momentarily distracted.</i>

1421
01:55:48,730 --> 01:55:49,697
<i>Daisy!</i>

1422
01:55:49,931 --> 01:55:51,159
<i>And that taxi hit Daisy.</i>

1423
01:55:51,266 --> 01:55:52,961
Daisy! Help!

1424
01:55:56,137 --> 01:55:58,105
<i>And her leg was crushed.</i>

1425
01:56:05,513 --> 01:56:06,673
Daisy?

1426
01:56:10,986 --> 01:56:13,511
- Who told you?
- Your friend wired me.

1427
01:56:14,589 --> 01:56:18,650
Very kind of you to come all this
way to see that I was all right.

1428
01:56:20,228 --> 01:56:22,219
You'd do the same for me.

1429
01:56:24,165 --> 01:56:25,359
My God.

1430
01:56:27,502 --> 01:56:30,960
Look at you. You're perfect.

1431
01:56:33,808 --> 01:56:38,302
I wish you hadn't come here. I don't
want you to see me like this.

1432
01:56:44,753 --> 01:56:47,051
<i>Her leg had been
broken in five places.</i>

1433
01:56:47,155 --> 01:56:50,249
<i>And with therapy and time,
she might walk again.</i>

1434
01:56:51,826 --> 01:56:53,691
<i>But she'd never dance.</i>

1435
01:56:55,330 --> 01:56:57,764
I'm gonna take you home with me.

1436
01:56:57,866 --> 01:57:00,630
- I want to look after you.
- I'm not going back to New Orleans.

1437
01:57:00,735 --> 01:57:02,896
Then I'll stay here in Paris.

1438
01:57:03,538 --> 01:57:06,473
Don't you understand? I
don't want your help.

1439
01:57:07,575 --> 01:57:11,909
I know I'm feeling sorry for myself,
but I don't want to be with you.

1440
01:57:12,013 --> 01:57:15,744
Tried to tell you that in New York.
You don't listen.

1441
01:57:17,285 --> 01:57:19,253
You might change your mind.

1442
01:57:19,354 --> 01:57:22,289
We are not little children
anymore, Benjamin.

1443
01:57:24,325 --> 01:57:27,556
Just stay out of my life.

1444
01:57:50,418 --> 01:57:53,649
<i>I was awfully cruel.</i>

1445
01:57:54,756 --> 01:58:00,160
He didn't understand. I couldn't
have him see me like that.

1446
01:58:02,864 --> 01:58:04,229
"I didn't leave right away."

1447
01:58:06,868 --> 01:58:10,167
<i>"I stayed in Paris for a
while to look out for her."</i>

1448
01:58:13,775 --> 01:58:15,606
I never knew that.

1449
01:58:19,013 --> 01:58:23,074
Oh, darling, could
you get the nurse?

1450
01:58:26,788 --> 01:58:31,851
I taught myself to walk again.

1451
01:58:34,929 --> 01:58:37,454
I took the train to Lourdes.

1452
01:58:38,833 --> 01:58:44,396
Let's take a look. That's normal.
Pulse rate is slowing.

1453
01:58:44,506 --> 01:58:46,497
She is gonna
struggle to breathe.

1454
01:58:46,608 --> 01:58:48,803
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.

1455
01:59:01,990 --> 01:59:07,895
All right, he says, "I went back home."
And then there's a lot of pages torn out.

1456
01:59:08,129 --> 01:59:11,826
"I listened to the sound of the
house." I read that already.

1457
01:59:12,767 --> 01:59:13,825
He...

1458
01:59:14,803 --> 01:59:18,068
He spilt something on it,
so it's hard to read, Mom.

1459
01:59:19,207 --> 01:59:21,971
Something about sailing,
does that make sense?

1460
01:59:22,677 --> 01:59:26,078
<i>I learned to sail an old boat of
my father's from the lake house.</i>

1461
01:59:35,290 --> 01:59:37,258
<i>I can't lie.</i>

1462
01:59:37,358 --> 01:59:40,156
<i>I did enjoy the company
of a woman or two.</i>

1463
01:59:48,503 --> 01:59:50,027
<i>Or maybe three.</i>

1464
02:00:26,574 --> 02:00:30,806
Don't know why you bother, Sam,
just gonna be there again tomorrow.

1465
02:00:35,183 --> 02:00:36,275
Mama.

1466
02:00:41,189 --> 02:00:43,657
<i>And in the spring of 1962,</i>

1467
02:00:47,528 --> 02:00:49,018
<i>she came back.</i>

1468
02:01:08,416 --> 02:01:12,045
- You want to know where I've been?
- No.

1469
02:01:14,055 --> 02:01:18,958
How come you didn't write or nothing?
Just disappearing like that.

1470
02:01:19,060 --> 02:01:21,620
It was something I
needed to do for myself.

1471
02:01:21,729 --> 02:01:25,460
Yeah, well, I never took you
to be the selfish type.

1472
02:01:25,566 --> 02:01:28,000
I sure hope I'm not wrong.

1473
02:01:29,170 --> 02:01:31,229
I'm usually not
wrong about people.

1474
02:01:31,339 --> 02:01:33,864
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

1475
02:01:34,842 --> 02:01:36,469
Y'all have fun.

1476
02:01:39,247 --> 02:01:43,581
- You haven't said two words.
- I don't want to ruin it.

1477
02:02:13,781 --> 02:02:16,079
- Sleep with me?
- Absolutely.

1478
02:02:53,855 --> 02:02:56,255
<i>I asked her to
come away with me.</i>

1479
02:02:58,526 --> 02:03:01,586
<i>We sailed into the Gulf
along the Florida Keys.</i>

1480
02:03:42,970 --> 02:03:47,339
I am so glad we didn't find
one another when I was 26.

1481
02:03:47,442 --> 02:03:51,742
- Why do you say that?
- I was so young.

1482
02:03:51,846 --> 02:03:53,609
And you were so old.

1483
02:03:54,315 --> 02:03:57,216
It happened when it was
supposed to happen.

1484
02:03:57,318 --> 02:04:00,446
I will enjoy each and every
moment I have with you.

1485
02:04:05,626 --> 02:04:08,094
I bet I can stay out
here longer than you.

1486
02:04:08,196 --> 02:04:09,788
I bet you can't.

1487
02:04:12,667 --> 02:04:15,158
Barely a line or a crease.

1488
02:04:15,603 --> 02:04:18,731
Every day I have more wrinkles.
It's not fair.

1489
02:04:20,408 --> 02:04:24,139
I love your wrinkles.
Both of them.

1490
02:04:29,851 --> 02:04:32,149
What's it like growing younger?

1491
02:04:34,622 --> 02:04:39,218
I can't really say. I'm always
looking out my own eyes.

1492
02:04:44,265 --> 02:04:48,031
Will you still love me when
my skin grows old and saggy?

1493
02:04:48,136 --> 02:04:52,596
Will you still love me when I have acne?
When I wet the bed?

1494
02:04:53,941 --> 02:04:56,774
When I'm afraid of
what's under the stairs?

1495
02:05:04,252 --> 02:05:05,310
What?

1496
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:15,318
- What are you thinking?
- Well, I was thinking how nothing lasts.

1497
02:05:17,732 --> 02:05:19,723
And what a shame that is.

1498
02:05:22,737 --> 02:05:24,364
Some things last.

1499
02:05:26,674 --> 02:05:30,872
- Good night, Daisy.
- Good night, Benjamin.

1500
02:05:47,295 --> 02:05:48,353
Mom?

1501
02:05:50,665 --> 02:05:54,658
- When did you meet Dad?
- Some time after that.

1502
02:05:57,838 --> 02:06:02,537
- Did you tell him about this Benjamin?
- He knew enough, darling.

1503
02:06:22,563 --> 02:06:23,655
Mama?

1504
02:06:30,871 --> 02:06:32,099
Queenie?

1505
02:06:35,276 --> 02:06:36,573
Hello?

1506
02:06:37,044 --> 02:06:40,639
Oh, hi, Mrs. Carter, it's Benjamin.
Where is everybody?

1507
02:06:40,748 --> 02:06:45,913
Oh, Benjamin. Queenie died.
I'm so sorry.

1508
02:07:14,615 --> 02:07:18,016
I'm so sorry for your loss.
She was a great woman.

1509
02:07:18,119 --> 02:07:19,916
Our deepest condolences.

1510
02:07:25,092 --> 02:07:28,084
<i>We buried her beside her beloved Mr.
Weathers.</i>

1511
02:07:35,102 --> 02:07:38,560
<i>And so we might have
memories of our own,</i>

1512
02:07:38,673 --> 02:07:40,607
<i>we sold my father's
house on Esplanade.</i>

1513
02:07:40,708 --> 02:07:43,302
It is a wonderful
old place, darling.

1514
02:07:43,911 --> 02:07:46,846
I think we are going
to be so happy here.

1515
02:07:46,947 --> 02:07:49,814
Oh, what a long family
history you have.

1516
02:07:49,917 --> 02:07:51,908
They come with the house.

1517
02:07:54,522 --> 02:07:57,423
- Come on.
- You have to see the master suite.

1518
02:07:58,959 --> 02:08:01,154
<i>We bought ourselves a duplex.</i>

1519
02:08:03,230 --> 02:08:05,255
I loved that house.

1520
02:08:07,702 --> 02:08:09,670
It smelled like firewood.

1521
02:08:10,805 --> 02:08:14,002
Don't... Don't stop, darling.

1522
02:08:14,642 --> 02:08:17,475
"It was one of the happiest
times of my life."

1523
02:08:17,578 --> 02:08:20,103
<i>We didn't have a
stick of furniture.</i>

1524
02:08:20,915 --> 02:08:23,645
<i>We would have picnics
in the living room.</i>

1525
02:08:27,154 --> 02:08:31,113
<i>We ate when we felt like it. Stayed
up all night when we wanted.</i>

1526
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:34,528
<i>We vowed never to
fall into routine,</i>

1527
02:08:34,628 --> 02:08:37,495
<i>to go to bed or wake
up at the same time.</i>

1528
02:08:37,598 --> 02:08:39,623
<i>We lived on that mattress.</i>

1529
02:09:15,369 --> 02:09:18,827
<i>Our neighbor, a Mrs. Van Dam,
was a physical therapist.</i>

1530
02:09:20,441 --> 02:09:23,171
<i>We lived four blocks
from a public pool.</i>

1531
02:10:01,582 --> 02:10:04,346
You know, you might've got a
few more years out of it,

1532
02:10:04,452 --> 02:10:08,548
but you chose to do something
so special and unique

1533
02:10:09,990 --> 02:10:13,687
that there was only a short
window of time you could do it.

1534
02:10:15,529 --> 02:10:18,020
So, even if nothing
ever happened,

1535
02:10:18,132 --> 02:10:21,226
you'd still be right
here where you are now.

1536
02:10:21,335 --> 02:10:23,565
I just don't like getting old.

1537
02:10:25,139 --> 02:10:27,630
They put too much
chlorine in here.

1538
02:11:08,916 --> 02:11:12,784
I promise you I'll never lose
myself to self-pity again.

1539
02:11:17,157 --> 02:11:20,183
<i>And I think right there and then</i>

1540
02:11:20,294 --> 02:11:24,287
<i>she realized none of
us is perfect forever.</i>

1541
02:11:28,269 --> 02:11:29,861
<i>She found peace.</i>

1542
02:11:31,772 --> 02:11:34,673
<i>She opened a studio and taught
young girls how to dance.</i>

1543
02:11:34,775 --> 02:11:37,869
<i>And tendu.</i>

1544
02:11:37,978 --> 02:11:43,041
Come back the other way. And
spot, spot, spot. Excellent.

1545
02:11:44,752 --> 02:11:47,186
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Good night.

1546
02:12:12,680 --> 02:12:15,274
You certainly are
beautiful to watch.

1547
02:12:17,117 --> 02:12:19,483
Dancing's all about the line.

1548
02:12:21,789 --> 02:12:23,654
The line of your body.

1549
02:12:25,059 --> 02:12:29,359
Sooner or later, you lose that
line, and you never get it back.

1550
02:12:35,269 --> 02:12:41,208
I figure, you were born
in 1918, 49 years ago.

1551
02:12:41,308 --> 02:12:42,798
I'm 43.

1552
02:12:45,012 --> 02:12:47,537
We are almost the same age.

1553
02:12:50,851 --> 02:12:55,015
- We're meeting in the middle.
- We finally caught up with each other.

1554
02:12:56,223 --> 02:12:57,315
Wait.

1555
02:12:58,692 --> 02:13:01,320
I want to remember us
just as we are now.

1556
02:13:12,206 --> 02:13:13,673
I'm pregnant.

1557
02:13:31,392 --> 02:13:35,021
You know, I swear the nurse
slipped and said it was a boy.

1558
02:13:50,044 --> 02:13:52,012
But I think it's a girl.

1559
02:13:57,351 --> 02:14:00,912
- I know you're afraid.
- I'm not hiding it.

1560
02:14:01,021 --> 02:14:02,113
Okay.

1561
02:14:09,463 --> 02:14:10,496
- What's your worst fear?
- Baby born like me.

1562
02:14:10,497 --> 02:14:12,055
- What's your worst fear?
- Baby born like me.

1563
02:14:12,166 --> 02:14:14,566
Then I will love
it all the more.

1564
02:14:16,603 --> 02:14:21,540
Okay. How can I be a father when I'm
heading in the other direction?

1565
02:14:22,209 --> 02:14:25,508
It's not fair to a child. I don't
want to be anybody's burden.

1566
02:14:25,612 --> 02:14:28,445
Sugar, we all end up in diapers.

1567
02:14:29,950 --> 02:14:31,975
I am gonna make this work.

1568
02:14:34,655 --> 02:14:37,556
I want this, and I
want it with you.

1569
02:14:37,658 --> 02:14:41,059
I want you to have everything
you want, all of it.

1570
02:14:41,161 --> 02:14:44,358
I'm just not sure how
to reconcile this.

1571
02:14:44,465 --> 02:14:46,524
Would you tell a blind man
he couldn't have children?

1572
02:14:46,633 --> 02:14:48,191
Here you go.

1573
02:14:48,302 --> 02:14:51,738
You'll be a father for
as long as you can.

1574
02:14:51,839 --> 02:14:54,637
I know the consequences.
I've accepted that.

1575
02:14:54,742 --> 02:14:57,302
Loving you is worth
everything to me.

1576
02:15:01,882 --> 02:15:03,509
I have to go pee.

1577
02:15:17,598 --> 02:15:19,828
<i>The oldest woman to ever
swim the English Channel</i>

1578
02:15:19,933 --> 02:15:21,662
<i>arrived here today in Calais...</i>

1579
02:15:21,769 --> 02:15:24,237
<i>- Keep it.
- ...having made the swim in 34 hours,</i>

1580
02:15:24,338 --> 02:15:26,533
<i>22 minutes and 14 seconds.</i>

1581
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:31,475
<i>The 68-year-old Elizabeth Abbott
arrived at 5:38 Greenwich mean time,</i>

1582
02:15:31,578 --> 02:15:33,341
<i>exhausted but happy.</i>

1583
02:15:33,447 --> 02:15:36,974
<i>Miss Abbott, how would you sum
up, in words, this achievement?</i>

1584
02:15:37,084 --> 02:15:38,642
<i>I suppose...</i>

1585
02:15:40,053 --> 02:15:41,782
<i>Anything's possible.</i>

1586
02:15:45,826 --> 02:15:46,986
<i>- All right?
- Yes. Thank you.</i>

1587
02:15:47,094 --> 02:15:48,061
<i>- You ready?
- Thank you very much.</i>

1588
02:15:48,162 --> 02:15:50,096
<i>Thank you. Thank you all.</i>

1589
02:15:50,197 --> 02:15:52,165
<i>- Yeah.
- You're very kind.</i>

1590
02:15:59,406 --> 02:16:03,274
<i>In the spring, on a
day like any other...</i>

1591
02:16:04,044 --> 02:16:06,012
I'll be back in an hour!

1592
02:16:11,051 --> 02:16:12,211
Honey?

1593
02:16:14,321 --> 02:16:16,312
Go and call an ambulance!

1594
02:16:19,259 --> 02:16:20,920
The baby's coming.

1595
02:16:21,762 --> 02:16:22,786
Operator, I need an ambulance.

1596
02:16:22,896 --> 02:16:25,330
- The baby's coming!
- 2714 Napoleon.

1597
02:16:32,573 --> 02:16:35,235
There you go. Keep breathing.

1598
02:16:36,176 --> 02:16:38,542
Deep breaths. Push.

1599
02:16:48,455 --> 02:16:49,854
There we go.

1600
02:17:06,273 --> 02:17:09,606
Everyone's fine. She's a
perfectly healthy baby girl.

1601
02:17:16,550 --> 02:17:17,710
Honey?

1602
02:17:19,686 --> 02:17:23,281
<i>She gave birth to a five
pound, four ounce baby girl.</i>

1603
02:17:39,506 --> 02:17:41,406
Did you count the toes?

1604
02:17:45,746 --> 02:17:47,236
She's perfect.

1605
02:17:47,681 --> 02:17:50,946
"And we named her for
my mother, Caroline."

1606
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:56,815
This Benjamin was my father?

1607
02:17:58,358 --> 02:18:00,485
And this is how you tell me?

1608
02:18:06,099 --> 02:18:07,430
Excuse me.

1609
02:18:17,945 --> 02:18:20,675
<i>...because all the ingredients
are there for a major storm,</i>

1610
02:18:20,781 --> 02:18:23,306
<i>possibly even up
to a Category 5.</i>

1611
02:18:30,090 --> 02:18:33,753
Hey, I know it's hard.
You can't smoke in here.

1612
02:18:36,997 --> 02:18:39,329
<i>Nobody can tell you exactly
where it's gonna hit,</i>

1613
02:18:39,433 --> 02:18:41,230
<i>but we have to go with the
guidance that we have,</i>

1614
02:18:41,335 --> 02:18:45,032
<i>incorporate that information
and then pass it along to you.</i>

1615
02:18:51,912 --> 02:18:56,747
"You grew as the doctor had
promised, normal and healthy."

1616
02:19:05,425 --> 02:19:08,519
You're gonna have to find
a real father for her.

1617
02:19:11,698 --> 02:19:13,461
What are you talking about?

1618
02:19:13,567 --> 02:19:16,832
She's gonna need someone
to grow old with.

1619
02:19:16,937 --> 02:19:19,770
She'll learn to accept whatever happens.
She loves you.

1620
02:19:19,873 --> 02:19:22,603
Honey, she needs a
father, not a playmate.

1621
02:19:26,747 --> 02:19:28,044
- Is it me?
- Of course not.

1622
02:19:28,148 --> 02:19:30,116
- Is my age beginning to bother you?
- Of course not.

1623
02:19:30,217 --> 02:19:34,210
- Is that what you're telling me?
- You can't raise the both of us.

1624
02:19:42,896 --> 02:19:47,799
<i>It was your first birthday.
We had a party for you.</i>

1625
02:19:48,568 --> 02:19:50,399
<i>The house was filled
with children.</i>

1626
02:19:50,504 --> 02:19:52,438
- How are you?
- Hey, man.

1627
02:19:52,539 --> 02:19:56,168
Before you turn around, they'll
be in high school, dating.

1628
02:20:28,608 --> 02:20:32,601
<i>I sold the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain,</i>

1629
02:20:32,712 --> 02:20:35,408
<i>I sold Button's Buttons,</i>

1630
02:20:35,515 --> 02:20:40,043
<i>I sold my father's sailboat, put
it all into a savings account.</i>

1631
02:20:42,322 --> 02:20:45,519
<i>And so that you and your
mother might have a life,</i>

1632
02:20:46,760 --> 02:20:50,662
<i>I left, before you could
ever remember me.</i>

1633
02:21:40,380 --> 02:21:42,473
"I left with just the
clothes on my back."

1634
02:21:43,950 --> 02:21:48,580
I don't want to read this now. Can
you just tell me where he went?

1635
02:21:50,056 --> 02:21:52,286
I don't really know.

1636
02:22:03,570 --> 02:22:08,507
It's for me. 1970. I was two.
"Happy Birthday."

1637
02:22:11,311 --> 02:22:14,144
"I wish I could have
kissed you good night."

1638
02:22:19,252 --> 02:22:20,981
They're all for me.

1639
02:22:22,022 --> 02:22:26,982
Five. "L wish I could have taken
you to your first day of school."

1640
02:22:31,531 --> 02:22:37,367
Six. "L wish I could have been
there to teach you to play piano."

1641
02:22:40,840 --> 02:22:43,775
1981, 13.

1642
02:22:43,877 --> 02:22:47,176
"I wish I could have told
you not to chase some boy."

1643
02:22:48,515 --> 02:22:52,144
"I wish I could have held you
when you had a broken heart."

1644
02:22:53,653 --> 02:22:59,421
"I wish I could have been your father.
Nothing I ever did will replace that."

1645
02:23:06,933 --> 02:23:09,458
I guess he went to lndia.

1646
02:23:09,569 --> 02:23:12,003
"For what it's worth,
it's never too late,

1647
02:23:12,105 --> 02:23:13,902
<i>- "or, in my case, too early..."
- ...or, in my case, too early,</i>

1648
02:23:15,175 --> 02:23:17,143
<i>to be whoever you want to be.</i>

1649
02:23:21,214 --> 02:23:23,876
<i>There's no time limit.
Start whenever you want.</i>

1650
02:23:26,786 --> 02:23:31,246
<i>You can change or stay the same.
There are no rules to this thing.</i>

1651
02:23:33,827 --> 02:23:37,319
<i>We can make the best
or the worst of it.</i>

1652
02:23:37,430 --> 02:23:39,728
<i>And I hope you make
the best of it.</i>

1653
02:23:42,836 --> 02:23:45,532
<i>I hope you see things
that startle you.</i>

1654
02:23:47,707 --> 02:23:51,199
<i>I hope you feel things
you never felt before.</i>

1655
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:57,172
<i>I hope you meet people with
a different point of view.</i>

1656
02:23:58,351 --> 02:24:01,047
<i>I hope you live a
life you're proud of.</i>

1657
02:24:04,057 --> 02:24:09,085
<i>And if you find that you're not,
I hope you have the strength</i>

1658
02:24:09,195 --> 02:24:12,392
<i>- to start all over again.
- "...start all over again."</i>

1659
02:24:13,967 --> 02:24:17,664
He had been gone a long time.

1660
02:24:19,472 --> 02:24:21,565
I'll see you next Thursday.

1661
02:24:24,544 --> 02:24:27,911
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Oh, good night, sweetheart.

1662
02:24:45,765 --> 02:24:47,756
I'm sorry, we're closing.

1663
02:24:50,704 --> 02:24:52,228
Can I help you?

1664
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:56,240
Are you here to
pick somebody up?

1665
02:25:06,619 --> 02:25:08,484
Why did you come back?

1666
02:25:10,090 --> 02:25:11,352
Mom?

1667
02:25:12,425 --> 02:25:13,483
Mom?

1668
02:25:14,728 --> 02:25:16,218
You ready yet?

1669
02:25:19,232 --> 02:25:20,324
Mom, what's wrong?

1670
02:25:20,433 --> 02:25:23,994
I was just hearing a very sad
story about a mutual friend

1671
02:25:24,104 --> 02:25:26,800
who I hadn't seen for
a very long time.

1672
02:25:28,074 --> 02:25:30,804
Caroline, this is Benjamin.

1673
02:25:30,910 --> 02:25:33,606
You knew him when you
were just a baby.

1674
02:25:36,082 --> 02:25:37,310
- Hi.
- Hi.

1675
02:25:39,252 --> 02:25:41,117
Hey.

1676
02:25:43,123 --> 02:25:47,958
- Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were done.
- Oh, this is a friend of my family's.

1677
02:25:48,061 --> 02:25:52,998
Benjamin Button, this
is my husband, Robert.

1678
02:25:53,099 --> 02:25:55,499
- How do you do?
- A pleasure.

1679
02:26:03,643 --> 02:26:06,635
Well, it was very
nice to meet you.

1680
02:26:06,746 --> 02:26:08,543
- We'll be in the car, darling.
- All right.

1681
02:26:08,648 --> 02:26:09,774
Bye.

1682
02:26:10,517 --> 02:26:12,280
I'm just locking up.

1683
02:26:17,056 --> 02:26:18,114
Wow.

1684
02:26:20,660 --> 02:26:23,527
She's beautiful.
Like her mother.

1685
02:26:25,131 --> 02:26:27,599
- Does she dance?
- Not very well.

1686
02:26:27,700 --> 02:26:29,600
I guess that'd be from
my side of things.

1687
02:26:29,702 --> 02:26:31,693
She's a dear, sweet girl.

1688
02:26:32,906 --> 02:26:37,240
She seems a little lost.
But then, who isn't at 12?

1689
02:26:37,444 --> 02:26:41,676
A lot of her reminds me of you.

1690
02:26:42,582 --> 02:26:46,518
My husband, he's a widower, or was...
Was a widower.

1691
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:50,822
He's an incredibly kind, just
bright, adventurous man.

1692
02:26:53,993 --> 02:26:56,689
- He's been a terrific father.
- Good.

1693
02:27:01,401 --> 02:27:05,303
- You are so much younger.
- Only on the outside.

1694
02:27:07,407 --> 02:27:08,931
You were right.

1695
02:27:10,710 --> 02:27:14,077
I couldn't have been
raising both of you.

1696
02:27:14,180 --> 02:27:15,943
I'm not that strong.

1697
02:27:20,153 --> 02:27:22,178
So, where are you staying?

1698
02:27:24,858 --> 02:27:25,847
What are you gonna do?

1699
02:27:25,959 --> 02:27:29,759
I'm staying at the Pontchartrain
Hotel on the Avenue.

1700
02:27:29,863 --> 02:27:33,390
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1701
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:34,660
But...

1702
02:27:41,174 --> 02:27:42,801
They're waiting.

1703
02:28:24,951 --> 02:28:28,216
I remember that. That was him?

1704
02:28:30,890 --> 02:28:32,050
The hurricane has
changed directions.

1705
02:28:32,158 --> 02:28:33,989
It's going to make
landfall sometime soon.

1706
02:28:34,093 --> 02:28:35,822
- Am I supposed to do something?
- Arrangements are being made

1707
02:28:35,929 --> 02:28:37,157
to move people, but
it's up to you.

1708
02:28:37,263 --> 02:28:39,128
No. No, we're... We're staying.

1709
02:28:39,232 --> 02:28:41,860
I'll let you know if
anything changes.

1710
02:28:43,903 --> 02:28:48,237
"That night, while I was sitting and
wondering why I came back at all,"

1711
02:28:48,341 --> 02:28:50,673
"there was a knock at the door."

1712
02:28:54,314 --> 02:28:55,542
Come in.

1713
02:29:09,862 --> 02:29:11,523
Are you all right?

1714
02:29:14,634 --> 02:29:18,730
I'm sorry, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

1715
02:29:27,780 --> 02:29:29,270
Nothing lasts.

1716
02:29:32,752 --> 02:29:35,084
I have never stopped loving you.

1717
02:29:41,094 --> 02:29:43,790
Oh, but, Benjamin, I'm
an old woman now.

1718
02:29:54,440 --> 02:29:56,635
Some things you never forget.

1719
02:30:16,929 --> 02:30:17,987
<i>...so few people even know</i>

1720
02:30:18,097 --> 02:30:19,792
<i>that you were ever in
jail in the first place.</i>

1721
02:30:19,899 --> 02:30:22,094
<i>I'll tell you, I am
sick about it, too,</i>

1722
02:30:22,201 --> 02:30:24,761
<i>because, please, if they're
not gonna give you an award</i>

1723
02:30:24,871 --> 02:30:26,930
<i>like "Man of the Year," at
least what they could do</i>

1724
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:29,702
<i>is stop having you
listed as an ex-convict</i>

1725
02:30:29,809 --> 02:30:32,300
<i>which I think is,
again, so unfair.</i>

1726
02:30:45,091 --> 02:30:46,888
Good night, Benjamin.

1727
02:30:48,428 --> 02:30:50,089
Good night, Daisy.

1728
02:30:53,299 --> 02:30:57,531
<i>And as I knew I would,
I watched her go.</i>

1729
02:31:00,273 --> 02:31:02,571
That's the last thing he wrote.

1730
02:31:03,743 --> 02:31:08,305
Sometime after your
father passed,

1731
02:31:08,414 --> 02:31:11,247
there was a call.

1732
02:31:14,320 --> 02:31:15,480
Hello.

1733
02:31:16,589 --> 02:31:18,079
Yes, speaking.

1734
02:31:21,427 --> 02:31:23,918
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1735
02:31:33,773 --> 02:31:35,638
It's the corner house.

1736
02:31:57,830 --> 02:31:59,195
Come on in.

1737
02:32:04,804 --> 02:32:06,829
- I'm Daisy Fuller.
- I'm David Hernandez,

1738
02:32:06,939 --> 02:32:10,636
with the Orleans Parish Department
of Child Welfare Services.

1739
02:32:10,743 --> 02:32:13,371
He was living in a
condemned building.

1740
02:32:15,181 --> 02:32:17,479
The police found this with him.

1741
02:32:17,583 --> 02:32:20,518
This address. It's got
your name in it a lot.

1742
02:32:21,721 --> 02:32:24,349
He's in very poor health. He
was taken to the hospital.

1743
02:32:24,457 --> 02:32:28,484
He doesn't seem to know who or where he is.
He's very confused.

1744
02:32:28,594 --> 02:32:32,155
I was telling Mr. Hernandez
that Benjamin is one of us.

1745
02:32:32,265 --> 02:32:36,099
If he needs a place to stay, it's
all right, he can stay here.

1746
02:33:05,565 --> 02:33:06,827
Benjamin?

1747
02:33:10,703 --> 02:33:12,500
You play beautifully.

1748
02:33:16,008 --> 02:33:17,839
He doesn't seem to
like to be touched.

1749
02:33:17,944 --> 02:33:19,605
He goes in and out of
states of recognition.

1750
02:33:19,712 --> 02:33:21,339
The doctors say, if they
didn't know any better,

1751
02:33:21,447 --> 02:33:23,881
he has the beginnings
of dementia.

1752
02:33:25,685 --> 02:33:27,414
Do you remember me?

1753
02:33:30,590 --> 02:33:31,921
I'm Daisy.

1754
02:33:34,527 --> 02:33:35,994
I'm Benjamin.

1755
02:33:41,701 --> 02:33:44,363
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.

1756
02:33:46,072 --> 02:33:51,442
Would you mind if I sit with you?
I would love to hear you play.

1757
02:33:55,314 --> 02:33:56,804
Do I know you?

1758
02:34:01,787 --> 02:34:03,414
<i>- I want some breakfast.
- And every day,</i>

1759
02:34:03,522 --> 02:34:07,481
<i>I would stop by to make sure
that he was comfortable.</i>

1760
02:34:07,593 --> 02:34:10,221
- No, I didn't.
- You just finished eating.

1761
02:34:10,329 --> 02:34:12,661
Don't think I don't
know what you're doing!

1762
02:34:12,765 --> 02:34:15,495
You're all fucking liars!

1763
02:34:15,601 --> 02:34:18,036
He doesn't believe he
just had his breakfast.

1764
02:34:18,037 --> 02:34:18,526
He doesn't believe he
just had his breakfast.

1765
02:34:19,839 --> 02:34:23,468
Now, why don't we see

1766
02:34:23,576 --> 02:34:26,943
if we can't find something
else for you to do?

1767
02:34:27,113 --> 02:34:30,276
I have a feeling there's a lot
of things I can't remember.

1768
02:34:30,383 --> 02:34:32,283
Well, like what, sugar?

1769
02:34:33,552 --> 02:34:37,545
It's like there's this
whole life I had,

1770
02:34:39,025 --> 02:34:41,425
and I can't remember
what it was.

1771
02:34:44,230 --> 02:34:45,561
It's okay.

1772
02:34:47,667 --> 02:34:49,134
It's okay to forget things.

1773
02:34:49,368 --> 02:34:54,931
<i>Many times, he would simply
forget who or where he was.</i>

1774
02:34:55,274 --> 02:34:56,935
There he is, he's up
there on the roof.

1775
02:34:57,043 --> 02:34:58,738
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

1776
02:34:58,844 --> 02:35:01,074
- Benjamin!
- I can see everything!

1777
02:35:01,180 --> 02:35:02,943
- I can see the big river!
- That's right,

1778
02:35:03,049 --> 02:35:04,778
you can see everything,
sweetheart.

1779
02:35:04,884 --> 02:35:06,875
I can see the graveyard
where Mama's buried,

1780
02:35:06,986 --> 02:35:10,353
- and all those other people.
- I want you to come down!

1781
02:35:10,456 --> 02:35:14,187
- What if I could fly?
- I knew a man who could fly.

1782
02:35:15,194 --> 02:35:18,163
You come down and I'll
tell you all about him.

1783
02:35:21,734 --> 02:35:23,326
Somebody go up there.

1784
02:35:29,942 --> 02:35:32,911
<i>He was five when I moved in.</i>

1785
02:35:33,012 --> 02:35:37,472
<i>Nearly the same age I
was when I had met him.</i>

1786
02:35:43,489 --> 02:35:47,425
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo"

1787
02:35:47,526 --> 02:35:49,960
"at 5:00 in the afternoon"

1788
02:35:50,062 --> 02:35:53,520
"when he had got his
beautiful hind legs."

1789
02:35:54,767 --> 02:35:56,064
<i>The days passed.</i>

1790
02:35:56,168 --> 02:36:00,400
<i>And I watched as he
forgot how to walk</i>

1791
02:36:05,644 --> 02:36:08,078
<i>- and how to talk.
- What's my name?</i>

1792
02:36:08,547 --> 02:36:09,878
I'm Daisy.

1793
02:36:11,050 --> 02:36:12,813
Can you say "Daisy"?

1794
02:36:14,387 --> 02:36:19,654
<i>In 2002, they put up a new
clock in that train station.</i>

1795
02:36:26,499 --> 02:36:30,265
<i>And in the spring of 2003,</i>

1796
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:36,301
<i>he looked at me</i>

1797
02:36:38,811 --> 02:36:43,874
<i>and I knew that he
knew who I was.</i>

1798
02:36:47,420 --> 02:36:53,222
<i>And then he closed his
eyes as if to go to sleep.</i>

1799
02:37:25,791 --> 02:37:29,955
- I wish I'd known him.
- Now you do.

1800
02:37:34,467 --> 02:37:38,233
Mom, I think I should
go see what's going on.

1801
02:37:45,277 --> 02:37:47,302
Good night, Benjamin.

1802
02:38:09,702 --> 02:38:12,068
<i>We're expecting flash flooding
after the levee break.</i>

1803
02:38:12,171 --> 02:38:14,401
<i>It occurred in the Ninth Ward.</i>

1804
02:38:17,443 --> 02:38:20,276
<i>Some people are born
to sit by a river.</i>

1805
02:38:21,814 --> 02:38:23,748
<i>Some get struck by lightning.</i>

1806
02:38:25,651 --> 02:38:27,744
<i>Some have an ear for music.</i>

1807
02:38:29,355 --> 02:38:30,982
<i>Some are artists.</i>

1808
02:38:32,324 --> 02:38:33,655
<i>Some swim.</i>

1809
02:38:35,094 --> 02:38:36,721
<i>Some know buttons.</i>

1810
02:38:38,531 --> 02:38:39,896
<i>Some know Shakespeare.</i>

1811
02:38:41,066 --> 02:38:42,829
<i>Some are mothers.</i>

1812
02:38:44,803 --> 02:38:47,829
<i>And some people dance.</i>
