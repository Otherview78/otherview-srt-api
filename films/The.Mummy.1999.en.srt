My Priest!

12
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,858
Pharaoh's bodyguards.

13
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,905
- You must go! Save yourself!
- No.

14
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,949
Only you can resurrect me!

15
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,663
I won't leave you! Get away from me!

16
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,543
You shall live again!

17
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,629
I will resurrect you!

18
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:38,511
My body is no longer his temple!

20
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:53,943

21
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,445

00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:21,468
Help.

76
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:50,998
Oops.

Compared to you,

00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,815
I am so very sorry. It was an accident.

84
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:21,194
My girl, when Rameses destroyed Syria,
that was an accident.

85
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,989
You are a catastrophe!

86
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,116
Look at my library!

87
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,326
Why do I put up with you?

88
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,872
Well, you put up with me because I can...

89
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,750
I can read and write Ancient Egyptian,

90
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,545
and I can...
I can decipher hieroglyphics and hieratic,

91
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:42,174
and, well, I am the only person
within 1,000 miles

92
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:45,510
who knows how to properly code
and catalog this library, that's why.

93
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:49,222
I put up with you because your father
and mother were our finest patrons.

94
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,682
That's why!

95
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,893
Allah rest their souls.

96
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:57,981
Now, I don't care how you do it,
I don't care how long it takes,

97
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,525
straighten up this <i>me shiver!</i>

98
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,540
Hello?

99
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,859
Abdul?

100
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,363
Mohammed?

101
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,534
Bob?

102
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,932
Have you no respect for the dead?

103
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:20,438
Of course I do.
But sometimes I'd rather like to join them.

104
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:24,985
Well, I wish you would do it before you ruin
my career the way you've ruined yours.

105
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,405
- Now, get out.
- My dear, sweet baby sister.

106
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,657
I'll have you know

107
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,785
that, at this precise moment,
my career is on a high note.

108
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:37,164
High note, ha! Jonathan, please,
I'm really not in the mood for you.

109
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,666
I've just made a bit of a mess in the library,

110
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,669
and the Bembridge scholars have
rejected my application form again.

111
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,881
They say I don't have enough experience
in the field.

112
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,096
You'll always have me, old mum.

113
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,102
Besides, I have just the thing
to cheer you up.

114
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:02,606
Oh, no, Jonathan,
not another worthless trinket.

115
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,692
If I have to take one more piece of junk
to the curator to try and

116
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,319
sell for you.

117
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,116
Where did you get this?

118
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,328
On a dig down in Thebes.

119
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,538
My whole life,
I've never found anything, Evy.

120
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,208
Please tell me I've found something.

121
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,756
- Jonathan.
- Yes?

122
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,842
I think you've found something.

123
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,389
You see the cartouche there?

124
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,976
It's the official royal seal of SETI the First,
I'm sure of it.

125
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,062
- Perhaps.
- Two questions.

126
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,898
Who the hell was SETI the First,
and was he rich?

127
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,317
He was the second pharaoh
of the 19th dynasty,

128
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,152
said to be the wealthiest pharaoh
of them all.

129
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,737
Good. I like this fellow.

130
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,240
- I like him very much.
- I've already dated the map.

131
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,866
It's almost 3,000 years old.

132
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:59,329
And if you look at the hieratic just here,
well, it's Hamunaptra.

133
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,915
Dear God, don't be ridiculous.

134
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,709
We're scholars, not treasure hunters.

135
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,963
Hamunaptra's a myth
told by ancient Arab storytellers

136
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,631
to amuse Greek and Roman tourists.

137
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:14,094
I know all the blather about the city
being protected by the curse of a mummy,

138
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:18,932
but my research has led me to believe
that the city itself may have actually existed.

139
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:23,061
- Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?
- Yes. The City of the Dead.

140
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:26,398
Where the earliest pharaohs were said
to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.

141
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,693
Yes, yes, in a big, underground
treasure chamber.

142
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,696
- Heh!
- Oh, come on. Everybody knows the story.

143
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,532
The entire necropolis was rigged to sink
into the sand on Pharaoh's command.

144
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,618
A flick of a switch, and the whole place
would disappear beneath the sand dunes,

145
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:39,953
taking the treasure with it.

146
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,956
As the Americans would say,
it's all fairy tales and hokum.

147
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,458
Oh, my goodness! Look at that!

148
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,593
You've burnt it!
You've burned off the part with the lost city.

149
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,929
It's for the best, I'm sure.

150
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:02,267
Many men have wasted their lives
in the foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra.

151
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,436
No one's ever found it.

152
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,105
Most have never returned.

153
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,066
Come, come! Step over the threshold.

154
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,819
Welcome to Cairo Prison, my humble home.

155
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,739
You told me that you got it
on a dig down in Thebes.

156
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,490
- Yeah, well, I was mistaken.
- You lied to me.

157
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,826
I lie to everybody.
What makes you so special?

158
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,995
- I am your sister.
- That just makes you more gullible.

159
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,955
You stole it from a drunk
at the local casbah.

160
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,541
Picked his pocket, actually,
so I don't think it's a very good...

161
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,753
Stop being so ridiculous.
What exactly is this man in prison for?

162
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,588
This I did not know.

163
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,466
But when I heard that you were coming,
I asked him that myself.

164
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,176
And what did he say?

165
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:39,721
He said he was just looking for a good time.

166
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:48,021
- This is the man that you stole it from?
- Yes, exactly.

167
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,190
So why don't we just go sniff
out a spot of tiff in...

168
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,733
Who are you?

169
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,903
- And who's the broad?
- "Broad"?

170
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:59,199
I'm just a local sort of missionary chap,
spreading the good word,

171
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:02,160
- but this is my sister, Evy.
- How do you do?

172
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:06,498
- Oh, well. Guess she's not a total loss.
- I beg your pardon.

173
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,375
I'll be back in a moment.

174
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,795
- Ask him about the box.
- We have found...

175
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,713
Hello. Excuse me.

176
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,424
We both found your puzzle box,

177
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,927
and we've come to ask you about it.

178
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,055
- No.
- No.

179
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:26,017
No. You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.

180
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,437
How do you know
the box pertains to Hamunaptra?

181
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:32,982
Because that's where I was when I found it.
I was there.

182
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,653
But how do we know
that's not a load of pig's wallow?

183
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,738
- Do I know you?
- No, no.

184
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,199
I've just got one of those faces.

185
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:49,165
You were actually at Hamunaptra?

186
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,585
- Yeah, I was there.
- You swear?

187
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,421
- Every damn day.
- I didn't mean that...

188
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:58,883
I know. I was there. Seti's place.
City of the Dead.

189
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,220
Could you tell me how to get there?

190
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,809
I mean, the exact location.

191
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,603
- You want to know?
- Well, yes.

192
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,148
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes.

193
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,487
Then get me the hell out of here!

194
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,200
Do it, lady!

195
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,166
- Where are they taking him?
- To be hanged.

196
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,294
Apparently, he had a very good time.

197
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,302
I will give you £100 to save this man's life.

198
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,805
Madame, I would pay £100
just to see him hang.

199
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,807
- £200.
- Proceed!

200
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,058
£300.

201
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,979
Any last requests, pig?

202
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,773
Yeah. Loosen the knot and let me go.

203
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,154
Of course we don't let him go!

204
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,200
£500!

205
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,330
And what else? I'm a very lonely man.

206
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,628
No!

207
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,929
His neck did not break.

208
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:31,684
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Now, we must watch him strangle to death.

209
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:43,154
He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

210
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,157
- You lie.
- I would never!

211
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,452
Are you telling me
this filthy, godless son of a pig

212
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,663
- knows where to find the City of the Dead?
- Yes!

213
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:52,872
- Truly?
- Yes!

214
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:55,291
And if you cut him down, we will give you...

215
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,338
- 10%.
- 50%.

216
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,048
- Twenty.
- Forty.

217
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,133
- Thirty!
- Twenty five.

218
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:05,635
Deal.

219
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,264
Cut him down!

220
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,236
GIZA PORT - CAIRO

221
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,447
Do you really think
he's going to show up?

222
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:28,992
Yes, undoubtedly,
knowing my luck.

223
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:32,412
He may be a cowboy, but I know the breed.
His word is his word.

224
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:37,166
Well, personally I think he's filthy, rude,
a complete scoundrel.

225
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,752
- I don't like him one bit.
- Anyone I know?

226
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,089
Oh.

227
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:46,801
Hello.

228
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,596
Smashing day for the start of an adventure,
eh, O'Connell?

229
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,681
Yeah. Yeah, smashing.

230
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,602
Oh, no, no, I'd never steal
from a partner, partner.

231
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:59,314
That reminds me.
No hard feelings about the...

232
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:02,609
- Oh, no, no. Happens all the time.
- Mr. O'Connell.

233
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,444
Can you look me in the eye
and guarantee me

234
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:07,363
this isn't some sort of a flimflam?

235
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:10,825
- Because if it is, I am warning you...
- You're warning me?

236
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,660
Lady, let me put it this way,

237
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:15,204
my whole damn garrison
believed in this so much

238
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:18,082
that without orders, they marched
halfway across Libya and into Egypt

239
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,167
to find that city.

240
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,087
When we got there,
all we found was sand and blood.

241
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,132
Let me get your bags.

242
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:33,097
Yes, yes, you're right.

243
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:36,809
Filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel.
Nothing to like there at all.

244
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,813
Bright good morning to all.

245
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:43,149
Oh, no. What are you doing here?

246
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:46,861
I'm here to protect my investment,
thank you very much.

247
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:11,511
Quit playing with your glasses
and cut the deck, Burns.

248
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:14,514
Without my glasses
I can't see the deck to cut it, Dave.

249
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:17,141
O'Connell, sit down.
We could use another player.

250
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:20,269
- I only gamble with my life, never my money.
- Never?

251
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:24,107
What if I was to bet you $500
we get to Hamunaptra before you?

252
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,276
- You're looking for Hamunaptra?
- Damn straight we are.

253
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,612
- And who says we are?
- He does.

254
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,448
Well... Well, how about it?

255
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,450
Is it a bet?

256
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:39,997
- All right, you're on.
- What makes you so confident, sir?

257
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:43,334
- What makes you?
- We got us a man who's actually been there.

258
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,087
Oh, what a coincidence,
because O'Connell...

259
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:49,257
Whose play is it? Is it my play? I thought...

260
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,760
Gentlemen, we got us a wager.
Good evening, Jonathan.

261
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,554
Night.

262
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:11,779
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

263
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:14,907
The only thing that scares me,
Mr. O'Connell, are your manners.

264
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:19,996
- Still angry about that kiss, huh?
- Well, if you call that a kiss.

265
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:30,214
Did I miss something?
Are we... Are we going into battle?

266
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:32,717
Lady, there's something out there.

267
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,761
Something underneath that sand.

268
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:38,097
Yes, well,
I'm hoping to find a certain artifact.

269
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,350
A book, actually.
My brother thinks there's treasure.

270
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:46,022
- What do you think's out there?
- In a word? Evil.

271
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:49,859
The Bedouin and the Tuaregs believe
that Hamunaptra is cursed.

272
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:53,196
Oh, look, I don't believe
in fairy tales and hokum, Mr. O'Connell,

273
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,200
but I do believe one of the most
famous books in history is buried there.

274
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,743
The <i>Book of Amun-Ra.</i>

275
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:02,580
It contains within it all
the secret incantations of the old kingdom.

276
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:05,500
It's what first interested me in Egypt
when I was a child.

277
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:09,045
It's why I came here. Sort of a life's pursuit.

278
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:13,382
And the fact that they say it's made out
of pure gold makes no never mind to you?

279
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:15,676
- Right?
- You know your history.

280
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,553
I know my treasure.

281
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:23,518
By the way,

282
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:25,978
why did you kiss me?

283
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:29,398
I was about to be hanged.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

284
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:36,155
What? What'd I say?

285
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:46,374
Surprise! My good friend, you're alive!

286
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:50,753
- I was so very, very worried.
- Well, if it ain't my little buddy, Beni.

287
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,756
- I think I'll kill you.
- Think of my children.

288
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,758
You don't have any children.

289
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,844
- Someday I might.
- Shut up!

290
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,263
So, you're the one
who's leading the Americans.

291
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,306
I might have known.
So, what's the scam, Beni?

292
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,810
You take them into the middle of the desert,
and then you leave them to rot?

293
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,603
Unfortunately, no.

294
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,856
These Americans are smart.

295
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,942
They pay me only half now,
half when I get them back to Cairo.

296
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:16,279
- So this time I must go all the way.
- Them's the breaks, huh?

297
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:20,283
You never believed
in Hamunaptra, O'Connell.

298
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,743
Why are you going back?

299
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:27,456
You see that girl? She saved my neck.

300
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:35,715
You always did have more balls than brains.

301
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,722
Yeah. Goodbye, Beni.

302
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,105
O'Connell!

303
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,328
George Bembridge...

304
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:08,456
In 1860...

305
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:14,128
1865, was...

306
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:18,215
Was...

307
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:22,219
Oh, for heaven's sake, girl,
it wasn't that good of a kiss, anyway.

308
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,194
Where is the map?

309
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,697
It's... It's... There.

310
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:44,700
And the key? Where is the key?

311
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,787
The key? The key? What key?

312
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,121
Evelyn!

313
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:07,056
The map! The map! I forgot the map!

314
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,434
Relax. I'm the map. It's all up here.

315
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:12,395
Oh, that's comforting.

316
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:22,071
- The key!
- Evy?

317
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:44,844
Hold on to this.

318
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,790
Can you swim?

319
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,543
Of course I can swim,
if the occasion calls for it.

320
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,879
Trust me. It calls for it.

321
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:46,739
O'Connell! O'Connell!
What are we going to do?

322
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,408
- Wait here! I'll go get help!
- Right!

323
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,349
Americans.

324
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,866
I say, bloody good show, chaps!

325
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,619
And did I panic?

326
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,538
I think not.

327
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:50,177
Get them out of the water!
Get them out of the water!

328
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:53,222
Come on, doggies!
Give them a smack, would you?

329
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,978
This is a messed-up country.

330
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:05,943
We've lost everything!
All of our tools, all the equipment!

331
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:07,319
All my clothes!

332
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:09,071
O'Connell!

333
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:11,407
Hey!

334
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,576
O'Connell!

335
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:17,621
It looks to me like I've got all the horses!

336
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,456
Hey, Beni!

337
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,586
Looks to me
like you're on the wrong side of the river!

338
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,379
Yeah.

339
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,690
I only want four! Four!

340
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,359
I only want four, not a whole bloody herd!

341
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:50,779
O'Connell! Can you believe the cheek?

342
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:52,698
Just pay the man.

343
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,700
Oh, for heaven's sake.

344
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,828
Can't believe the price of these fleabags.

345
00:33:57,912 --> 00:34:01,373
Yes, happy. Very good.

346
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:03,542
You probably could've got them for free.

347
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:06,420
- All we had to do was give him your sister.
- Yes.

348
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,215
Awfully tempting, wasn't it?

349
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,181
Awfully.

350
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,250
Never did like camels.

351
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:48,045
Filthy buggers.
They smell, they bite, they spit.

352
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,548
- Disgusting.
- I think they're adorable.

353
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:54,843
<i>Oh, baby</i>

354
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,121
This one is strong.

355
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,965
Good morning, my friend.

356
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,233
What the hell we doing?

357
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:17,194
Patience, my good <i>barat'm.</i> Patience.

358
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:21,990
Remember our bet, O'Connell.
First one to the city, 500 cash bucks.

359
00:37:22,116 --> 00:37:24,576
A hundred of them bucks is yours
if you help us win that bet.

360
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,286
Oh, my pleasure.

361
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:29,998
Hey, O'Connell. Nice camel.

362
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,046
Get ready for it.

363
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,842
- For what?
- We're about to be shown the way.

364
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:57,401
- Will you look at that?
- Can you believe it?

365
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,111
Hamunaptra.

366
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,696
Here we go again.

367
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:36,732
So long, Beni!

368
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,737
That serves you right.

369
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,973
Go, Evy! Go!

370
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,058
Do they know something we don't?

371
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:57,229
They are led by a woman.
What does a woman know?

372
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,690
That's a statue of Anubis.

373
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:01,608
Its legs go deep underground.

374
00:40:01,692 --> 00:40:05,654
According to Bembridge scholars,
that's where we'll find a secret compartment

375
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,906
containing the golden <i>Book of Amun-Ra.</i>

376
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:13,579
Jonathan, you're meant to catch the sun
with that.

377
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:19,167
- So, what are these old mirrors for?
- Ancient mirrors.

378
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:22,462
It's an ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

379
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:25,632
Here, this for you.

380
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:30,971
Go ahead. It's something
I borrowed off our American brethren.

381
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,600
I thought you might like it,
you might need it for when you're...

382
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:37,936
Yeah. What are you looking at?

383
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,033
Hey, look for bugs. I hate bugs.

384
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:54,286
Do you realize
we're standing inside a room

385
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,622
no one has entered in over 3,000 years?

386
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:00,042
What is that god-awful stench?

387
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:13,430
And then there was light.

388
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:17,392
Hey, that is a neat trick.

389
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:20,354
- Oh, my God. It's a sah-netjer.
- What?

390
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,856
- A preparation room.
- Preparation for what?

391
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,067
For entering the afterlife.

392
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:29,321
Mummies, my good son.
This is where they made the mummies.

393
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,833
What the...

394
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:47,464
What was that?

395
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:50,384
Sounds like bugs.

396
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:55,055
- He said bugs.
- What do you mean, bugs? I hate bugs!

397
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,074
The legs of Anubis.

398
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,079
The secret compartment should be hidden
somewhere inside here.

399
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,773
You scared the bejesus
out of us, O'Connell.

400
00:42:46,857 --> 00:42:48,150
Likewise.

401
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:51,403
- Hey, that's my tool kit.
- No, I don't think so.

402
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,448
Okay. Perhaps I was mistaken.

403
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,451
Have a nice day, gentlemen.

404
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:59,494
We have a lot of work
to be getting along with.

405
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:02,914
- Push off! This is our dig site.
- We got here first.

406
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,252
This here's our statue, friend.

407
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:10,088
I don't see your name written on it, pal.

408
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,425
Yes, well, there's only four of you

409
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:15,761
and 15 of me.

410
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:18,305
Your odds are not so great, O'Connell.

411
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,349
- I've had worse.
- Yeah, me, too.

412
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,563
Oh, look, for goodness' sake,
let's be nice, children.

413
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:30,692
If we're going to play together,
we must learn to share.

414
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:35,197
There are other places to dig.

415
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:43,246
According to these hieroglyphics,
we're underneath the statue.

416
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,123
We should come up right between his legs.

417
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:47,125
When those damn Yanks go to sleep...

418
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:48,752
- No offense.
- None taken.

419
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,253
We'll dig our way up and steal that book

420
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:51,338
right out from under them.

421
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,799
Are you sure
we can find this secret compartment?

422
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:56,760
Oh, yes, if those beastly Americans
haven't beaten us to it.

423
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,512
- No offense.
- None taken.

424
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:00,722
Where'd our smelly little friend get to?

425
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,239
Hey.

426
00:44:21,952 --> 00:44:23,662
What have we here?

427
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:28,917
Blue gold.

428
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,922
This will fetch a mighty fine price.

429
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:48,353
- Let's get us some treasure!
- Careful!

430
00:44:49,271 --> 00:44:51,189
SETI was no fool.

431
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:54,985
I think perhaps
we should let the diggers open it.

432
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,072
Oh, I think we should listen
to the good doctor, Henderson.

433
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,867
Yeah, sure. Let them open it.

434
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:26,558
Let me get this straight.

435
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,060
They ripped out your guts
and stuffed them in jars.

436
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:32,731
They'd take out your heart as well.
You know how they took out your brains?

437
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:34,441
I don't think we need to know this.

438
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:38,069
They'd take a sharp, red-hot poker,
stick it up your nose,

439
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:41,740
scramble things about a bit,
and then rip it all out through your nostrils.

440
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:44,159
- That's gotta hurt.
- It's called mummification.

441
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,328
- You'll be dead when they do this.
- For the record,

442
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:49,456
if I don't make it out of here,
don't put me down for mummification.

443
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:50,832
Likewise.

444
00:46:00,008 --> 00:46:01,843
Oh, my God. It's a...

445
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,471
It's a sarcophagus.

446
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:09,517
Buried at the base of Anubis.

447
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,564
He must have been
someone of great importance.

448
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:18,693
Or he did something very naughty.

449
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,198
Oh, Allah.

450
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:28,787
One more.

451
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:32,999
One more.

452
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,394
Help me! Help me!

453
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:53,728
Help me!

454
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,956
Well, who is it?

455
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:17,585
"He That Shall Not Be Named."

456
00:47:22,257 --> 00:47:24,175
This looks like some sort of a lock.

457
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:26,344
Well, whoever's in here
sure wasn't getting out.

458
00:47:26,428 --> 00:47:28,054
Yeah, no kidding.

459
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:31,141
It'd take us a month
to crack into this thing without a key.

460
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:32,434
A key?

461
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:36,187
A key! A key!
That's what he was talking about!

462
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:38,940
- Who?
- The man on the barge,

463
00:47:39,024 --> 00:47:40,942
the one with the hook.
He was looking for a key.

464
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:42,694
Hey, that's mine.

465
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,847
- What do you suppose killed him?
- Did you ever see him eat?

466
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,809
Seems that our American friends
had a little misfortune of their own today.

467
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:18,688
Three of their diggers were melted.

468
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:20,648
- What?
- How?

469
00:48:20,857 --> 00:48:22,233
Salt acid.

470
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:27,322
Pressurized salt acid.
Some kind of ancient booby trap.

471
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,700
Maybe this place really is cursed.

472
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:36,414
Oh, for goodness' sake, you two!

473
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:38,792
- You don't believe in curses?
- No, I don't.

474
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:43,004
I believe if I can see it and I can touch it,
it's real. That's what I believe.

475
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:45,381
I believe in being prepared.

476
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:48,676
Let's see what our friend
the warden believed in.

477
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,893
- What?
- My God, what is it?

478
00:48:57,811 --> 00:48:59,437
A broken bottle.

479
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:02,315
Glenlivet, 12 years old!

480
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:06,653
He may have been a stinky fellow,
but he had good taste.

481
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:12,075
Take this. Stay here.

482
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:15,036
- No, wait, wait! Wait for me. Wait!
- Evy!

483
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,289
Excuse me,
but didn't the man just say stay here?

484
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:19,415
Evy!

485
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:25,421
Mr. Henderson! Wake up!

486
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:06,421
O'Connell!

487
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,941
Enough!

488
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:31,779
We will shed no more blood,
but you must leave.

489
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:34,616
Leave this place or die.

490
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,327
You have one day.

491
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,310
Evelyn.

492
00:51:04,646 --> 00:51:05,730
Hey.

493
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:10,526
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

494
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:12,820
- You sure?
- Thank you.

495
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:16,824
That proves it. Old Seti's fortune's
got to be under this sand.

496
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:19,994
For them to protect it like this,
you know there's treasure down there.

497
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:23,998
No, these men are desert people.
They value water, not gold.

498
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,628
You know, maybe just at night,
we could combine forces?

499
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:33,091
Hey, tough stuff, try a right hook.

500
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:35,718
Ball up your fist and put it...
Put it up like that.

501
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,762
And then mean it. Hit it right here.

502
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,056
- Mean it!
- Okay.

503
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:45,353
Okay, it's time for another drink.

504
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:48,022
Unlike my brother, sir,

505
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:51,192
I know when to say no.

506
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:55,780
And unlike your brother, miss,

507
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,740
you, I just don't get.

508
00:51:59,701 --> 00:52:02,578
I know. You're wondering

509
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:07,875
what is a place like me doing
in a girl like this.

510
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:12,171
- Yeah, something like that.
- Egypt is in my blood.

511
00:52:12,714 --> 00:52:13,965
You see,

512
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:18,636
my father was a very, very famous explorer.

513
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:21,097
And he loved Egypt so much,

514
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:24,726
he married my mother, who was an Egyptian

515
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:27,729
and quite an adventurer herself.

516
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:32,900
I get your father
and I get your mother, and...

517
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,571
I get him, but...

518
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:39,615
What are you doing here?

519
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:45,246
Look, I may not be an explorer

520
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:49,959
or an adventurer or a treasure seeker

521
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:53,254
or a gunfighter, Mr. O'Connell,

522
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:58,634
but I am proud of what I am.

523
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:01,095
And what is that?

524
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:02,263
I

525
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:06,434
am a librarian.

526
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:13,608
And I am going to kiss you,

527
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,277
- Mr. O'Connell.
- Call me Rick.

528
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:24,118
Rick.

529
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:03,241
- There is a curse upon this chest.
- Curse, my ass.

530
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:06,077
- Who cares?
- Have a care, Mr. Henderson.

531
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,247
In these hallowed grounds,
that which was set forth in ancient times

532
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:11,791
- is as strong today as it was then.
- We understand.

533
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,835
What's it say?

534
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,594
"Death will come on swift wings

535
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:26,472
"to whomsoever opens this chest."

536
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,777
We should not be here.

537
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,155
This is not good.

538
00:54:42,238 --> 00:54:43,614
It says,

539
00:54:43,698 --> 00:54:45,616
"There is one, the undead,

540
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:49,704
"who, if brought back to life,
is bound by sacred law

541
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,747
"to consummate this curse."

542
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:54,667
Let's make sure we don't bring anyone
back from the dead then.

543
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,712
"He will kill all who open this chest

544
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:00,965
"and assimilate their organs and fluids,

545
00:55:02,425 --> 00:55:04,969
"and in so doing, he will regenerate

546
00:55:05,303 --> 00:55:07,513
"and no longer be the undead,

547
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,558
"but a plague upon this Earth."

548
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:15,646
Well, we didn't come
all this way for nothing.

549
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,982
- That's right.
- It's the curse.

550
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:19,817
It's the curse.

551
00:55:19,901 --> 00:55:23,696
It's the curse! Beware of the curse!

552
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,323
Beware!

553
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:28,159
Stupid superstitious bastard.

554
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:33,164
Oh, I've dreamt about this
since I was a little girl.

555
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,665
You dream about dead guys?

556
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:37,835
Look, the sacred spells
have been chiseled off.

557
00:55:38,211 --> 00:55:41,339
This man must have been condemned
not only in this life, but in the next.

558
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:43,591
- Tough break.
- Yeah, I'm all tears.

559
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:47,094
Now, let's see who's inside, shall we?

560
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:00,358
Oh, my God,
I hate it when these things do that.

561
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:01,901
Is he supposed to look like that?

562
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:04,403
No, I've never seen
a mummy look like this before.

563
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:07,240
He's still... Still...

564
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:08,366
- Juicy.
- Juicy.

565
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:09,700
Yes.

566
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:12,745
He must be more than 3,000 years old,

567
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:15,414
and, well, it looks as if he's still

568
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,375
decomposing.

569
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,794
Hey, look at that.

570
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:26,259
- What do you make of this?
- My God, these marks were made with...

571
00:56:27,677 --> 00:56:29,136
Fingernails.

572
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,306
This man was buried alive.

573
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,269
And he left a message.

574
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:40,648
"Death is only the beginning."

575
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:01,043
Oh, my God.

576
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:03,838
It does exist.

577
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,757
- The <i>Book of the Dead.</i>
- A book?

578
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,969
Who cares about a book?
Where the hell's the treasure?

579
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:11,679
This, gentlemen.

580
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:15,057
This is treasure.

581
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:19,353
Hell, I wouldn't trade you for a brass...

582
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,650
Look at that.

583
00:57:25,026 --> 00:57:27,278
There's your treasure, gentlemen.

584
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,363
Now, we're on to something.

585
00:57:45,338 --> 00:57:48,215
I believe you need a key to open that book.

586
00:57:50,343 --> 00:57:51,469
Say, O'Connell,

587
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,971
what do you think
these babies'll fetch back home?

588
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:58,184
We hear you boys found yourselves
a nice, gooey mummy. Congratulations.

589
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:02,605
If you dry that fellow out,
you might be able to sell him for firewood.

590
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:04,231
Look what I found.

591
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:05,900
You're in her seat.

592
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,193
- Now!
- Yup.

593
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:10,321
Scarab skeletons, flesh-eaters.

594
00:58:10,655 --> 00:58:13,157
I found them inside our friend's coffin.

595
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:17,286
They can stay alive for years
feasting on the flesh of a corpse.

596
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:21,749
Unfortunately for our friend, he was
still alive when they started eating him.

597
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,001
So somebody
threw these in with our guy,

598
00:58:24,085 --> 00:58:26,212
and then they slowly ate him alive?

599
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:27,880
Very slowly.

600
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,591
He certainly wasn't a popular fellow
when they planted him, was he?

601
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:34,970
Well, he probably got a little too frisky
with the pharaoh's daughter.

602
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:37,223
Well, according to my readings,

603
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:42,019
our friend suffered the Hom-Dai,
the worst of all Ancient Egyptian curses,

604
00:58:42,103 --> 00:58:44,730
one reserved only
for the most evil of blasphemers.

605
00:58:44,814 --> 00:58:48,192
In my research, I've never heard of
this curse having actually been performed.

606
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,695
- That bad, huh?
- Yes, well, they...

607
00:58:50,778 --> 00:58:53,614
They never used it because they feared it so.

608
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:58,202
It's written that if a victim of the Hom-Dai
should ever arise,

609
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:01,622
he would bring with him
the 10 plagues of Egypt.

610
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:34,572
That's called stealing, you know.

611
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:38,409
According to you and my brother,
it's called borrowing.

612
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:43,914
I thought the <i>Book of Amun-Ra</i>
was made out of gold.

613
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:47,960
It is made out of gold.
This isn't the <i>Book of Amun-Ra.</i>

614
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:50,212
This is something else.

615
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:53,215
I think this may be the <i>Book of the Dead.</i>

616
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:55,259
The <i>Book of the Dead?</i>

617
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,678
Are you sure you want to be
playing around with this thing?

618
00:59:57,762 --> 00:59:59,597
It's just a book.

619
00:59:59,764 --> 01:00:03,517
No harm ever came from reading a book.

620
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:11,609
That happens a lot around here.

621
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:15,446
So, what's it say?

622
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:18,657
"Amun Ra. Amun Dei."

623
01:00:19,492 --> 01:00:22,203
It speaks of the night and of the day.

624
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:40,137
No! You must not read from the book!

625
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:08,123
Run!

626
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,253
Go, go!

627
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:22,930
What have we done?

628
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:27,935
- Where the hell did they come from?
- I ain't waiting around to find out.

629
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:33,649
My glasses. My glasses!

630
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:35,860
Leave me! Leave me!

631
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:37,444
Hey! Hey!

632
01:01:38,112 --> 01:01:40,698
Could you help me find my gl...

633
01:01:43,993 --> 01:01:46,078
Wait for me!

634
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:10,561
Who's there?

635
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:14,356
Who's there?

636
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,122
Daniels?

637
01:02:54,188 --> 01:02:55,564
Oh, Jon!

638
01:03:01,904 --> 01:03:03,322
Scarabs!

639
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,575
Run, Evy! Go, go, go! Run!

640
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:39,775
- Evelyn?
- Evy?

641
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:42,486
- Evelyn?
- Evy!

642
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,002
Oh, Mr. Burns. Thank goodness.

643
01:03:58,085 --> 01:04:00,170
I was just starting to get scared.

644
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:02,089
I've lost everyone.

645
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,301
My eyes. My eyes...

646
01:04:27,948 --> 01:04:29,533
Please help me.

647
01:04:30,451 --> 01:04:34,371
My tongue. He took my tongue.

648
01:04:34,455 --> 01:04:36,040
Please don't leave me.

649
01:04:39,043 --> 01:04:41,045
Anck-Su-Namun?

650
01:04:41,462 --> 01:04:43,213
Damn it! It's a trap door.

651
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:45,966
There's gotta be a switch
or something around here someplace.

652
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:50,304
- Run, you sons of bitches! Run!
- Go.

653
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:05,486
Go! Go!

654
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,871
Come with me my Princess Anck-su-namum.

655
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:18,999
There you are!
Will you quit playing hide-and-seek?

656
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:21,043
Come on. Let's get out of here.

657
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:23,962
Evy!

658
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:37,601
- Move!
- Yeah, right.

659
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:40,896
Did you see that?
It was walking. It was walking!

660
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,908
I told you to leave or die.

661
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,827
You refused.

662
01:05:55,035 --> 01:05:56,954
Now, you may have killed us all,

663
01:05:57,037 --> 01:06:00,249
for you have unleashed a creature
we have feared for more than 3,000 years.

664
01:06:00,332 --> 01:06:03,794
- Relax. I got him.
- No mortal weapon can kill this creature.

665
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:05,879
He's not of this world.

666
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:16,306
- You bastard.
- What did you do to him?

667
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:20,477
We saved him. Saved him
before the creature could finish his work.

668
01:06:20,936 --> 01:06:24,189
Leave, all of you, quickly,
before he finishes you all.

669
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:30,988
I must now go on the hunt,
and try and find a way to kill him.

670
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:33,365
I already told you, I got him.

671
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:37,327
Know this,

672
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,497
this creature is the bringer of death.

673
01:06:40,581 --> 01:06:45,210
He will never eat, he will never sleep,
and he will never stop.

674
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:21,955
May the good Lord protect
and watch over me

675
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:24,541
as a shepherd watches over his flock.

676
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,390
No? Okay.

677
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,328
The language of the slaves...

678
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:06,333
I may have use for you.

679
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,045
And the rewards...

680
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:13,507
...will be great.

681
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:16,885
My prince.

682
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:23,850
Where are the other sacred jars?!

683
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:44,371
FORT BRYDON - CAIRO

684
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,880
I thought you said you didn't believe
in that fairy tales and hokum stuff.

685
01:08:54,423 --> 01:08:58,802
Having an encounter with a 3,000-year-old
walking, talking corpse

686
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,220
does tend to convert one.

687
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:03,640
Forget it. We're out the door,
down the hall, and we're gone.

688
01:09:03,724 --> 01:09:06,810
- Oh, no, we are not.
- Oh, yes, we are.

689
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:09,646
Oh, no, we are not. We woke him up,
and we are going to stop him.

690
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:11,815
We? What we? We didn't read that book.

691
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:14,568
I told you not to play around with that thing.
Didn't I tell you?

692
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:17,821
Yes, right then, me, me, me, me.
I, I, I woke him up and I intend to stop him.

693
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,323
Yeah? How?

694
01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:22,034
You heard the man.
No mortal weapons can kill this guy.

695
01:09:22,117 --> 01:09:25,329
Then we are just going to have to find
some immortal ones.

696
01:09:25,412 --> 01:09:26,872
There goes that we again.

697
01:09:26,955 --> 01:09:29,333
Look, will you listen to me?
We have to do something.

698
01:09:29,416 --> 01:09:32,044
Once this creature has been reborn,
his curse is going to spread

699
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:33,670
until the whole of the Earth is destroyed.

700
01:09:33,754 --> 01:09:36,757
- Yeah? Is that my problem?
- It is everybody's problem.

701
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,134
Evelyn, I appreciate
you saving my life and all,

702
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:42,512
but when I signed on, I agreed to take you
out there and to bring you back.

703
01:09:42,596 --> 01:09:45,932
I have done that. End of job. End of story.
Contract terminated.

704
01:09:46,016 --> 01:09:47,225
That's all I am to you? A contract?

705
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:52,189
You can either tag along with me or you can
stay here and try and save the world.

706
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:54,900
- What's it gonna be?
- I'm staying.

707
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:56,526
- Fine.
- Fine.

708
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,111
- Fine.
- Fine.

709
01:09:58,278 --> 01:09:59,488
Fine.

710
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:09,748
I'm the last of the Royal Air Corps
still stationed out here, you know...

711
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:12,834
Some bloody idiot spilt his drink.

712
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:17,089
All the other laddies died in the sky
and were buried in the sand.

713
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:19,674
Good chaps, every one of them, too.

714
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,594
- Hi, Winston.
- Yeah...

715
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:26,348
You know, O'Connell,
ever since the end of the great war,

716
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:31,353
there hasn't been a single challenge
worthy of a man like me.

717
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:34,106
Yeah. We all got
our little problems today, Winston.

718
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:37,651
I just wish I could have chucked it in
with the others

719
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:39,903
and gone down in flame and glory,

720
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:42,406
instead of sitting around here, rotting

721
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:44,074
- of boredom and booze.
- Of boredom and booze.

722
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:45,659
Cheers.

723
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:50,622
Oh, well, back to the airfield.

724
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:55,085
- Tell me, has your sister always been...
- Oh, yes, always.

725
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:58,171
We're all packed up, but the damn boat
doesn't leave till tomorrow morning.

726
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:00,590
Tail set firmly between your legs, I see.

727
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:04,636
You can talk. You don't have
some sacred walking corpse after you.

728
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,972
So, how's your friend?

729
01:11:08,557 --> 01:11:12,436
He had his eyes and his tongue ripped out.
How would you be?

730
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:17,691
I'm so pleased to meet you.

731
01:11:18,233 --> 01:11:21,361
Prince Imhotep does not like to be touched.

732
01:11:21,695 --> 01:11:25,240
A silly Eastern superstition, I'm afraid.

733
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:26,825
Please forgive me.

734
01:11:31,705 --> 01:11:36,626
Mr. Burns, Prince Imhotep
thanks you for your hospitality.

735
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,003
No.

736
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:40,547
And for your eyes,

737
01:11:41,423 --> 01:11:44,301
- and for your tongue.
- Wha...

738
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:47,721
- But I am afraid more is needed.
- Wha...

739
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:50,265
The prince must finish the job

740
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:52,100
and consummate the curse,

741
01:11:52,184 --> 01:11:54,060
- which you and your friends...
- No!

742
01:11:54,144 --> 01:11:57,772
- ...have brought down upon yourselves.
- No! Wait! No!

743
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:03,320
Good luck, boys.

744
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:09,451
Sweet Jesus!

745
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:11,912
Tasted just like...

746
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:14,289
Blood.

747
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:19,794
"And the rivers and waters of Egypt
ran red and were as blood."

748
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:23,590
He's here.

749
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,013
Oh, looks like it's gonna storm.

750
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:33,141
- Oh, Evelyn!
- Oh, so you're still here.

751
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:35,769
We've got problems.

752
01:12:58,291 --> 01:12:59,543
Hey!

753
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:03,213
Beni, you little stink weed. Where you been?

754
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:30,490
We are in serious trouble.

755
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:50,176
You saved me from the undead.

756
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:51,428
I thank you.

757
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:11,197
We are in very serious trouble.

758
01:14:13,033 --> 01:14:15,285
<i>- He does seem to like you Evy.
- Yeah, what's that about?</i>

759
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:16,578
What's this guy want?

760
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:19,748
There's only one person
that can give us any answers.

761
01:14:19,873 --> 01:14:22,375
- You!
- Miss Carnahan.

762
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:25,670
- Gentlemen.
- What is he doing here?

763
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:29,633
Do you really want to know,
or would you prefer to just shoot us?

764
01:14:29,716 --> 01:14:33,720
After what I just saw,
I'm willing to go on a little faith here.

765
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:36,389
We are part
of an ancient secret society.

766
01:14:36,473 --> 01:14:40,185
For over 3,000 years,
we have guarded the City of the Dead.

767
01:14:40,268 --> 01:14:44,564
We are sworn at manhood to do any and all
in our part to stop the High Priest Imhotep

768
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:46,149
from being reborn into this world.

769
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:47,817
Because of you, we have failed.

770
01:14:47,901 --> 01:14:50,487
You think this justifies the killing
of innocent people?

771
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:52,489
To stop this creature? Let me think.

772
01:14:52,572 --> 01:14:53,907
- Yes!
- Yes!

773
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:58,286
Question. Why doesn't he like cats?

774
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:00,288
Cats are the guardians of the underworld.

775
01:15:00,372 --> 01:15:02,207
He will fear them
until he is fully regenerated.

776
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:03,541
Then he will fear nothing.

777
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:05,502
You know how he gets
his self fully regenerated?

778
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:09,631
- By killing everyone who opened that chest.
- And sucking them dry!

779
01:15:09,756 --> 01:15:12,133
Jonathan, will you stop
playing with that?

780
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:17,013
When I saw him alive at Hamunaptra,
he called me Anck-Su-Namun.

781
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:22,060
And then just now in Mr. Burns' quarters,
he tried to kiss me.

782
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:25,063
It's because of his love for Anck-Su-Namun
that he was cursed.

783
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:28,066
- Apparently, even after 3,000 years...
- He is still in love with her.

784
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:30,694
Yes, that is very romantic,
but what has it got to do with me?

785
01:15:30,777 --> 01:15:33,029
Perhaps he will once again
try to raise her from the dead.

786
01:15:33,113 --> 01:15:34,155
Yes.

787
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:37,409
And it appears he has already chosen
his human sacrifice.

788
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:42,122
Bad luck, old mum.

789
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:43,873
On the contrary,

790
01:15:43,957 --> 01:15:47,627
it may just give us the time we need
to kill the creature.

791
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:50,338
We will need all the help we can get.

792
01:15:51,089 --> 01:15:53,007
His powers are growing.

793
01:15:57,804 --> 01:16:01,474
"And he stretched forth his hand
towards the heavens

794
01:16:01,558 --> 01:16:05,395
"and there was darkness
throughout the land of Egypt."

795
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,897
We must stop him
from regenerating.

796
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:09,065
Who opened that chest?

797
01:16:09,149 --> 01:16:10,692
There was me
and Daniels here.

798
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:13,111
- And Burns, of course.
- And that Egyptologist fellow.

799
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:14,362
What about my buddy, Beni?

800
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:16,698
No, he scrammed out of there
before we opened the thing.

801
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:19,743
- Yeah, he was the smart one.
- Yeah, that sounds like Beni.

802
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:23,204
We must find the Egyptologist
and bring him back to the safety of the fort

803
01:16:23,288 --> 01:16:25,457
- before the creature can get to him.
- Right.

804
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:27,125
She stays here. You three, come with me.

805
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,085
- Not me...
- No, no!

806
01:16:29,169 --> 01:16:33,089
Just a minute! You can't leave me behind
like some old carpetbag.

807
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:36,509
Who put you in charge, O'Connell?
What do you think you are doing?

808
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:38,136
Jonathan! O'Connell!

809
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:41,014
- Sorry, but he's a bit tall.
- Jonathan, coward that you are...

810
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:43,558
O'Connell, you are not leaving me in here!

811
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,978
Jonathan, if you don't
open this door in one minute flat...

812
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:49,022
- O'Connell...
- This door doesn't open.

813
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:50,607
- Let me out of here.
- She doesn't come out,

814
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:52,650
- and no one goes in, right?
- Right.

815
01:16:52,734 --> 01:16:54,402
- Right?
- Right.

816
01:16:54,486 --> 01:16:56,654
O'Connell! Jonathan!

817
01:16:56,738 --> 01:16:57,989
Let's go, Jonathan.

818
01:16:58,072 --> 01:17:01,201
Oh, I thought I could just stay at the fort
and reconnoiter.

819
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:02,577
- Now!
- Yeah, right.

820
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,121
We're just gonna rescue the Egyptologist.

821
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:41,574
Well, well, well. Let me guess.
Spring cleaning.

822
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:47,121
Nice shot.

823
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:51,084
Oh, Beni, did you fall down?
Let me help you up.

824
01:17:53,461 --> 01:17:57,048
You came back from the desert
with a new friend, didn't you, Beni?

825
01:17:57,131 --> 01:17:59,634
What friend? You are my only friend.

826
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:05,849
What the hell are you doing with this creep?
What's in it for you?

827
01:18:05,932 --> 01:18:09,936
It is better to be the right hand of the devil
than in his path.

828
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:13,273
As long as I serve him, I am immune.

829
01:18:16,943 --> 01:18:18,361
Immune from what?

830
01:18:19,863 --> 01:18:20,947
What did you say?

831
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:23,867
I don't wanna tell you.
You'll just hurt me some more.

832
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:26,828
What are you looking for?
And try not to lie to me.

833
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:28,538
The book!

834
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:31,791
The black book they found at Hamunaptra.
He wants it back.

835
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:34,043
He said to me it would be
worth its weight in gold.

836
01:18:34,127 --> 01:18:36,796
- What does he want the book for?
- I don't know.

837
01:18:37,297 --> 01:18:40,717
Something about bringing
his dead girlfriend back to life.

838
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,219
But that's all.
He just wants the book, I swear.

839
01:18:43,303 --> 01:18:46,723
Just the book, I swear. And your sister.

840
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:48,016
But other than that...

841
01:19:39,025 --> 01:19:42,904
- That's two down, two to go.
- Then he'll be coming after Evy.

842
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:44,614
Guards in place!

843
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:46,240
Reporting all clear, sir!

844
01:19:46,324 --> 01:19:47,825
To hell with this.

845
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:50,328
I'm going downstairs, get me a drink.
You want something?

846
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:53,623
- Yeah. Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon.
- All right.

847
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:56,000
- And a shot of bourbon.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

848
01:19:56,084 --> 01:19:58,628
- And a bourbon chaser.
- I'll get your damn bourbon!

849
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,880
Don't worry about the door.

850
01:21:40,313 --> 01:21:42,315
Anck-Su-Namun.

851
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:55,995
Hey, get your ugly face off of her!

852
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,334
Look what I got.

853
01:22:18,184 --> 01:22:21,604
- You all right?
- Well, I'm not sure.

854
01:22:31,906 --> 01:22:35,910
Well, according to legend, the black book
the Americans found at Hamunaptra

855
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:38,037
is supposed to bring people
back from the dead.

856
01:22:38,121 --> 01:22:40,164
Until now, it was a notion
I was unwilling to believe.

857
01:22:40,248 --> 01:22:42,792
Believe it, sister.
That's what brought our buddy back to life.

858
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:46,254
Yes. I'm thinking that if the black book
can bring dead people to life...

859
01:22:46,337 --> 01:22:50,007
- Then maybe the gold book can kill him.
- That's the myth.

860
01:22:50,091 --> 01:22:52,969
Now, we just have to find out
where the gold book is hidden.

861
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:54,679
<i>Imhotep.</i>

862
01:22:55,054 --> 01:22:56,639
<i>Imhotep.</i>

863
01:22:56,848 --> 01:22:58,558
<i>Imhotep.</i>

864
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:00,643
Imhotep.

865
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:02,937
Imhotep.

866
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:05,356
Imhotep.

867
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:07,316
Imhotep.

868
01:23:07,567 --> 01:23:09,569
Imhotep.

869
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:11,654
Imhotep.

870
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,489
Imhotep.

871
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:15,741
Imhotep.

872
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,410
Imhotep.

873
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:21,497
Last but not least,
my favorite plague, boils and sores.

874
01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:23,583
They have become his slaves.

875
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:27,253
So it has begun, the beginning of the end.

876
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:29,922
Not quite yet, it hasn't. Come on.

877
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:32,758
Imhotep.

878
01:23:33,259 --> 01:23:35,094
Imhotep.

879
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:36,762
Imhotep.

880
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:41,434
Imhotep.

881
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:43,311
Imhotep.

882
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:45,771
Imhotep.

883
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:55,615
According to Bembridge scholars,
the golden <i>Book of Amun-Ra</i>

884
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:57,700
is located inside the statue of Anubis.

885
01:23:57,783 --> 01:23:59,785
- That's where we found the black book.
- Exactly.

886
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:01,746
Looks like the old boys
at Bembridge were mistaken.

887
01:24:01,829 --> 01:24:03,456
They mixed the books up.

888
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:05,333
Mixed up where they were buried.

889
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:08,461
So, if the black book
is inside the statue of Anubis,

890
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:11,214
then the golden book must be inside...

891
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:19,889
- Come on, Evy, faster.
- Patience is a virtue.

892
01:24:21,766 --> 01:24:23,434
Not right now, it isn't.

893
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:26,437
- I think I'll go and get the car started.
- I've got it.

894
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:30,733
The golden <i>Book of Amun-Ra</i>
is at Hamunaptra inside the statue of Horus.

895
01:24:30,942 --> 01:24:33,194
Take that, Bembridge scholars.

896
01:24:42,453 --> 01:24:44,622
Imhotep.

897
01:24:45,248 --> 01:24:47,833
Imhotep.

898
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,503
Imhotep.

899
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:52,713
Imhotep.

900
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:55,132
Imhotep.

901
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:04,475
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

902
01:25:06,227 --> 01:25:08,771
Get this thing in gear, boy.
Let's get out of here.

903
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:11,190
- Evy. Come on, Evy. Hurry up.
- Imhotep!

904
01:25:11,357 --> 01:25:12,858
Imhotep!

905
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:22,368
You're gonna get yours, Beni! You hear me?

906
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:27,373
- You're gonna get yours!
- Oh, like I've never heard that before!

907
01:25:57,737 --> 01:25:59,655
Hang on!

908
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:37,985
Hey! O'Connell! O'Connell!

909
01:27:33,499 --> 01:27:34,667
Jump down!

910
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:39,505
Move, move, move!

911
01:27:42,341 --> 01:27:44,051
Imhotep.

912
01:27:44,135 --> 01:27:45,719
Imhotep.

913
01:27:46,137 --> 01:27:47,680
Imhotep.

914
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,849
Imhotep.

915
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:51,684
Imhotep.

916
01:27:51,809 --> 01:27:53,352
Imhotep.

917
01:27:53,853 --> 01:27:55,646
Imhotep.

918
01:27:58,607 --> 01:28:00,359
It's the creature.

919
01:28:00,943 --> 01:28:02,778
He's fully regenerated.

920
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:10,202
Come with me, my princess.

921
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:13,539
It is time to make you mine forever.

922
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:16,041
For all eternity, idiot.

923
01:28:22,173 --> 01:28:25,509
Take my hand,
and I will spare your friends.

924
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:28,137
Oh, dear.

925
01:28:30,431 --> 01:28:33,142
- Have you got any bright ideas?
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

926
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:36,645
You better think of something fast,
because if he turns me into a mummy,

927
01:28:36,729 --> 01:28:39,064
you're the first one I'm coming after.

928
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:44,153
No.

929
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:45,279
- Don't.
- No!

930
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:47,656
He has to take me to Hamunaptra
to perform the ritual.

931
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:51,368
She is right.
Live today, fight tomorrow.

932
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,591
I'll be seeing you again.

933
01:29:11,722 --> 01:29:13,057
Evelyn!

934
01:29:15,768 --> 01:29:18,938
- Hey, that's mine.
- Thank you.

935
01:29:20,356 --> 01:29:21,607
Kill them all!

936
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:23,901
No! Let go of me!

937
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:25,569
- Imhotep.
- Let go of me!

938
01:29:25,653 --> 01:29:28,614
- Goodbye, my friend.
- Come here, you little...

939
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:30,032
Imhotep.

940
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:31,575
Imhotep.

941
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:33,786
Imhotep.

942
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:38,707
Come on!

943
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:40,709
- What about my sister?
- We're gonna get her back!

944
01:29:40,793 --> 01:29:42,503
Go!

945
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:43,963
You're next!

946
01:29:45,464 --> 01:29:47,383
Come on! Give me your hand!

947
01:29:47,466 --> 01:29:49,635
- You go!
- Come on!

948
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:50,970
Go!

949
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:26,672
Morning, Winston. A word?

950
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:31,927
What's your little problem got to do
with His Majesty's Royal Air Corps?

951
01:30:32,011 --> 01:30:33,554
Not a damn thing.

952
01:30:35,389 --> 01:30:37,933
- Is it dangerous?
- You probably won't live through it.

953
01:30:38,017 --> 01:30:39,935
By Jove, do you really think so?

954
01:30:40,019 --> 01:30:42,521
Everybody else we've bumped into has died.
Why not you?

955
01:30:42,605 --> 01:30:45,274
What's the... What's the challenge, then?

956
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:49,028
Rescue the damsel in distress,
kill the bad guy, and save the world.

957
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:52,948
Winston Havlock at your service, sir.

958
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:06,211
Are you all right?

959
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:09,548
Do I bloody look all right?

960
01:31:13,594 --> 01:31:15,179
How you doing?

961
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:28,442
See that? I've never seen one so big.

962
01:31:29,068 --> 01:31:30,986
- Never?
- No!

963
01:31:43,791 --> 01:31:46,919
Get off me! Get off!

964
01:31:48,671 --> 01:31:50,547
I need a new job.

965
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:12,986
Oh, my God.

966
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:14,863
We're back.

967
01:32:27,376 --> 01:32:28,961
O'Connell.

968
01:32:41,515 --> 01:32:43,809
Oh, my God.

969
01:32:45,436 --> 01:32:49,398
Hey, Winston! Pedal faster!

970
01:32:51,608 --> 01:32:53,360
Hang on, men!

971
01:33:36,862 --> 01:33:39,072
Stop it! You'll kill them!

972
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:40,866
That's the idea.

973
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:58,467
Here I come, laddies!

974
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:29,248
I love the whole sand-wall trick.
It was beautiful.

975
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:30,582
Bastard.

976
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:49,268
Excuse me?

977
01:34:51,937 --> 01:34:56,650
A little help would be useful,
if it's not too much trouble!

978
01:34:58,151 --> 01:35:00,112
Yeah, yeah. All right.

979
01:35:05,659 --> 01:35:08,245
Winston! Hey, Winston!

980
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:26,305
Quicksand! Get back! It's quicksand.

981
01:36:14,061 --> 01:36:15,604
Keep moving!

982
01:36:17,064 --> 01:36:21,443
Nasty little fellows such as yourself
always get their comeuppance.

983
01:36:22,152 --> 01:36:25,364
- Really? They do?
- Oh, yes.

984
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:27,866
Always.

985
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:37,209
I'd take
those bigger stones first.

986
01:36:37,668 --> 01:36:40,796
Take them from the top, otherwise
the whole thing will cave in on us.

987
01:36:40,879 --> 01:36:43,340
Come on. Put your backs into it.

988
01:36:44,883 --> 01:36:47,761
Yes, well, you've got the idea. Chop, chop.

989
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:58,313
I say!

990
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:04,569
Gents, you should come
and have a look at this.

991
01:37:12,369 --> 01:37:13,620
What?

992
01:37:14,037 --> 01:37:15,956
It's my arm! My arm!

993
01:37:19,501 --> 01:37:21,211
- Do something!
- Hold it!

994
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:24,423
Do something! Do something!
Not that! Not that!

995
01:37:34,683 --> 01:37:36,226
O'Connell.

996
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:04,963
Bembridge scholars never wrote about this.

997
01:38:09,968 --> 01:38:12,387
Get off me. Get off!

998
01:38:13,972 --> 01:38:15,390
Kill them...

999
01:38:15,474 --> 01:38:18,852
...and wake the others.

1000
01:38:58,308 --> 01:39:00,602
Wha...Wha...

1001
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:23,291
- Can you see...
- Yeah.

1002
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:25,710
- Can you believe...
- Yeah.

1003
01:39:25,794 --> 01:39:27,546
- Can we just...
- No.

1004
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:41,601
- Who the hell are these guys?
- Priests.

1005
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:43,562
Imhotep's priests.

1006
01:39:43,979 --> 01:39:45,522
All right, then.

1007
01:40:33,445 --> 01:40:34,946
There he is!

1008
01:40:36,114 --> 01:40:38,074
Hello, Horus, old boy.

1009
01:40:47,292 --> 01:40:49,252
Time to close the door.

1010
01:41:29,501 --> 01:41:31,211
Anck-Su-Namun.

1011
01:41:40,345 --> 01:41:41,805
O'Connell!

1012
01:41:42,555 --> 01:41:44,015
Jonathan!

1013
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:57,779
Damn. These guys just don't quit, do they?

1014
01:41:57,904 --> 01:41:59,447
Keep digging.

1015
01:42:23,263 --> 01:42:24,889
The <i>Book of Amun-Ra.</i>

1016
01:42:33,315 --> 01:42:36,151
Save the girl. Kill the creature.

1017
01:42:48,455 --> 01:42:52,751
What are you waiting for?
Get out! Get out!

1018
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:02,427
You all right? Let's go.

1019
01:43:52,644 --> 01:43:54,562
With your death, Anck-su-namun shall live.

1020
01:43:54,646 --> 01:43:57,148
And I shall be invincible!

1021
01:43:57,482 --> 01:44:01,236
The <i>Book of Amun-Ra!</i>
I found it, Evy! I found it!

1022
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:02,946
The Book of Amun-Ra.

1023
01:44:03,029 --> 01:44:05,907
Shut up
and get me off here, Jonathan!

1024
01:44:06,241 --> 01:44:09,828
Open the book, Jonathan.
It's the only way to kill him.

1025
01:44:09,911 --> 01:44:12,705
You have to open the book
and find the inscription.

1026
01:44:12,789 --> 01:44:16,584
Well, I can't open it!
It's locked or something.

1027
01:44:18,336 --> 01:44:21,673
- We need the key, Evy!
- It's inside his robes.

1028
01:44:28,555 --> 01:44:29,806
O'Connell!

1029
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:03,047
Mummies.

1030
01:45:14,517 --> 01:45:17,395
Look out! There's one there... O'Connell!

1031
01:45:42,962 --> 01:45:45,048
Here's an inscription.

1032
01:46:04,108 --> 01:46:05,735
Oh, boy.

1033
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:16,079
Oh, yeah.
This just keeps getting better and better.

1034
01:46:16,746 --> 01:46:18,915
- Do something, Jonathan.
- Me?

1035
01:46:18,998 --> 01:46:21,960
- You can command them.
- You have got to be joking.

1036
01:46:22,043 --> 01:46:25,547
Finish the inscription on the cover, idiot,
then you can control them.

1037
01:46:25,630 --> 01:46:27,465
Oh. Right.

1038
01:47:05,128 --> 01:47:07,005
Hurry up, Jonathan!

1039
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:42,540
- I can't figure out this last symbol.
- What does it look like?

1040
01:47:56,638 --> 01:48:00,016
It's a bird. A stork!

1041
01:48:12,904 --> 01:48:14,739
Ahmenophus.

1042
01:48:16,449 --> 01:48:18,034
Oh, yes, I see.

1043
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:51,275
Destroy him!!

1044
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:52,443
Destroy him!!

1045
01:48:53,903 --> 01:48:55,655
I command you to destroy him!!

1046
01:49:03,913 --> 01:49:05,748
Anck-Su-Namun!

1047
01:49:10,253 --> 01:49:11,671
Give me that book!!

1048
01:49:16,843 --> 01:49:18,428
Anck-Su-Namun!

1049
01:49:25,935 --> 01:49:27,770
Now you die.

1050
01:49:45,997 --> 01:49:48,374
Evy, I've got it.

1051
01:49:53,004 --> 01:49:54,505
Keep him busy.

1052
01:49:58,342 --> 01:49:59,844
No problem.

1053
01:50:12,231 --> 01:50:15,693
- Hurry, Evy! Hurry!
- You're not helping.

1054
01:50:18,696 --> 01:50:21,032
Now it's your turn.

1055
01:50:24,744 --> 01:50:26,287
Oh! I've got it.

1056
01:50:56,192 --> 01:50:59,362
I thought you said
it was gonna kill him!

1057
01:51:08,454 --> 01:51:09,914
He's mortal.

1058
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:48,286
Death is only the beginning.

1059
01:52:18,441 --> 01:52:19,859
Time to go.

1060
01:52:30,536 --> 01:52:33,372
You've lost the book!
Jonathan, I can't believe...

1061
01:52:33,456 --> 01:52:34,957
- Hurry!
- Come on!

1062
01:53:03,444 --> 01:53:06,238
- Couldn't we just...
- No, Jonathan!

1063
01:53:12,536 --> 01:53:14,038
O'Connell!

1064
01:53:16,707 --> 01:53:19,919
- O'Connell! Wait!
- Come on, come on!

1065
01:53:20,169 --> 01:53:23,214
- Wait! Please!
- Come on, come on! Beni!

1066
01:53:25,049 --> 01:53:26,634
Goodbye, Beni.

1067
01:54:04,755 --> 01:54:05,923
Go away.

1068
01:54:38,706 --> 01:54:40,499
Look out, look out!

1069
01:55:27,463 --> 01:55:29,924
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1070
01:55:30,007 --> 01:55:33,844
You have earned the respect and gratitude
of me and my people.

1071
01:55:33,928 --> 01:55:36,639
Yes, well, it was nothing.

1072
01:55:36,722 --> 01:55:39,016
May Allah smile upon you always.

1073
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:43,187
And yourself.

1074
01:55:49,276 --> 01:55:52,071
- Yes, anytime.
- Stay out of trouble.

1075
01:55:53,155 --> 01:55:55,908
He's just leaving us here.

1076
01:56:00,246 --> 01:56:04,041
Well, I guess we go home
empty-handed again.

1077
01:56:04,416 --> 01:56:06,210
I wouldn't say that.

1078
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:10,422
Oh, please!

1079
01:56:19,557 --> 01:56:22,309
How about you, darling?
Would you like a little kissy-wissy?
