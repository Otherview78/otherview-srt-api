147
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,400
I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product-- pots and pans.

148
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Pots and pans. Something they can use.

149
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Something they can feel in their hands.

150
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,700
They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want.

Everybody's happy.

152

If you want, you could run the company for me.

153
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,000
Let me understand.

154
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,900
They'd put up all the money, I'd do all the work.

155
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,200
What, if you don't mind my asking, would you do?

156
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,700
I'd make sure it's known the company's in business.

157
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,000
I'd see that it had a certain panache.

158
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,900
That's what I'm good at, not the work. Not the work.

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,100
In a metal container maybe?

319
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,600
Not essential? I think you misunderstand the meaning of the word.

320
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,600
No Blauschein, sir. Stand over there.

321
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,500
Move. Next!

322
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,800
What do you mean, ''Not essential''?

323
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,600
I teach history and literature. Since when is not essential?

324
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,300
He's a metal polisher.

325
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,000
It was not right? It's very good. He's 53 years old.

326
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,200
It's too new. Mmm. Thank you.

327
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,900
You're crazy. You left it in your drawer.

328
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,200
How many times have I told you?

329
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,000
Your work certificate you keep in your pocket at all times.

330
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,000
And you leave everything in your drawer.

331
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,500
How many times I've told you?

332
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,800
I'm a metal polisher.

333
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,200
Take the round sheet of tin,

334
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,200
dip it in soap emulsion.

335
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:29,400
Then place it centrally in the press.

336
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,000
We obtain the soup pot. The soup pot.

337
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,500
Soup pot.

338
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,700
Grosz, Mrs. Grosz, stay together.

339
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,200
Sir, I have ten work permits here for the Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik,

340
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,100
cosigned by Mr. Bankier and myself.

341
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,800
If it's carbonized, clean it with a file.

342
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,700
But don't touch both the electrodes at the same time.

343
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,900
You'll get electrocuted. Here, have a try.

344
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,700
Roll the metal under the press,

345
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,200
but be very careful unless you want your fingers...

346
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,100
to become part of the teapot.

347
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,400
Occupation? I'm a writer. I play the flute.

348
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,900
But Moses is a skilled metalworker.

349
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,200
He can make tin pots. He can make tanks.

350
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,200
He can make whatever Mr. Schindler asks.

351
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,900
He's highly skilled. Give him your card.

352
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,300
Moses, give him your card.

353
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,700
Now, dip the basin with the tongs...

354
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,300
into the enamel solution.

355
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,800
And after swiveling it around, carefully place it aside to drip dry.

356
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,300
And whatever he asks you, allow me just to represent you and speak for you.

357
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Don't say a word.

358
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,000
Filing, billing, keeping track of my appointments, shorthand.

359
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,300
Typing, obviously. How is your typing? Uh, all right.

360
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,300
Please.

361
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,000
[ Typing Slowly, Bell Rings ]

362
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,100
[ Typing Extremely Slow ]

363
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,900
You need a secretary. Pick one.

364
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,900
I don't know how. They're all so... qualified.

365
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,900
You have to choose.

366
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,000
Prosze sie ladnie usmiechac. Big smile. Big smile.

367
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,500
Uwaga.

368
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,900
####

369
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,900
If you would, look after my guest.

370
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,300
Um, boxed teas are good. Coffiee, pate, um...

371
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,500
kielbasa sausage, cheeses, Beluga caviar. Yes.

372
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,400
And, of course, who could live without German cigarettes?

373
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,700
Get me as many as you can find.

374
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,900
And some more fresh fruit.

375
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,800
The real rarities-- oranges, lemons, pineapples.

376
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,600
I need several boxes of Cuban cigars. The best. Yes.

377
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,400
And dark, unsweetened chocolate. Not in the shape ofladyfigers, the chunk chocolate.

378
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,600
Yes. Big as my hand, you sample at wine tastings.

379
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,900
We're going to need lots of cognac. The best, Hennessy.

380
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,400
Dom Perignon champagne. Um, get L 'espadon sardines...

381
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,500
and, oh, try to find nylon stockings.

382
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,200
It is my distinct pleasure to announce...

383
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:47,900
the fully operational status of Deutsche Email Fabrik...

384
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,300
Patrzjakies szmaty!

a full line of field and kitchenware...

392
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,700
unsurpassable in all respects by my competitors.

393
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,400
See attached list and available colors.

394
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,300
Anticipating the enclosed bids will meet with your approval.

395
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,200
Made in Havana, Cuba. Looking forward to a long and mutually prosperous association.

396
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,500
Look at this. I extend to you in advance my sincerest gratitude...

397
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,500
and very best regards. Oskar Schindler.

398
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,000
Yeah, I need 700 gross from here for next Thursday.

399
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,900
Nine hundred-- No, make it ten for Wednesday.

400
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,800
All this stuff here goes to Madritsch's factory on Tuesday of next week.

401
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,000
My father was fond of saying, ''You need three things in life

402
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,200
''a good doctor, a forgiving priest...

403
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,500
and a clever accountant. ''

404
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,000
The first two... I've never had much use for.

405
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,500
But the third--

406
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,300
Just pretend, for Christ's sake.

407
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,200
Is that all?

408
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,200
I'm trying to thank you.

409
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,500
I'm saying I couldn't have done this without you.

410
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,900
The usual thing would be to acknowledge my gratitude.

411
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,900
It would also, by the way, be the courteous thing.

412
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,800
You're welcome.

413
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,900
Get out of here.

414
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,500
Klonowska, who is it?

415
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,500
She's so embarrassed. Look at her.

416
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,800
You know something? You would like her.

417
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,800
Oskar, please. What?

418
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,300
I don't have to like her... just because you do. You would, though.

419
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,200
It doesn't work that way.

420
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,800
You've done well here.

421
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,800
You look wonderful.

422
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,200
Be careful of the step, miss. Mrs. Schindler, Marek.

423
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,800
##

424
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,900
It's not a charade, all this? How could it be a charade?

425
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,400
The clothes, the car, the apartment. Wait a minute.

426
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Take a guess how many people are on my payroll. Oskar.

427
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:05,200
My father, at the height of his success, had 50. I've got 3 50.

428
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,500
3 50 workers on the factory floor, with one purpose.

429
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,800
To make pots and pans?

430
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,900
To make money. For me.

431
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,800
Does anyone ask about me?

432
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,500
Back home? Everybody.

433
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,500
All the time.

434
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,900
Hmm.

435
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:41,500
They won't soon forget the name Schindler here, I can tell you that.

436
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,200
''Oskar Schindler,'' they'll say.

437
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,700
''Everybody remembers him.

438
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,200
''He did something extraordinary.

439
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,400
''He did something no one else did.

440
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,800
''He came here with nothing--

441
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,800
''a suitcase--

442
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:11,500
''and built a bankrupt company into a major manufactory.

443
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,100
''And left with a steamer trunk--

444
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,800
''Two steamer trunks full of money,

445
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:24,200
all the riches of the world.''

446
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Hmm.

447
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,500
It's comforting to see that nothing's changed.

448
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,200
You're wrong, Emilie.

449
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,700
There's no way I could have known this before,

450
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,200
but there was always something missing.

451
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,300
In every business I tried, I can see now, it wasn't me that failed.

452
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,200
Something was missing.

453
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,800
Even if I'd known what it was, there's nothing I could have done about it...

454
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,500
because you can't create this thing.

455
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,900
And it makes all the difference in the world between success and failure.

456
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,500
Luck?

457
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,800
War.

458
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,000
Should I stay?

459
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,900
It's a beautiful city.

460
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,900
I asked you if I should stay.

461
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,000
It's up to you.

462
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,500
Promise me, Oskar, no doorman or maitre d' will ever presume...

463
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:02,000
I'm anyone other than Mrs. Schindler, and I'll stay.

464
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,500
Good-bye, darling.

465
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,300
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's still hot.

466
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
We're doing well?

467
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,700
Yes. Better this month than last?

468
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,100
Yes. Any reason to think next month will be worse?

469
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,400
The war could end.

470
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,900
What? There is a machinist outside...

471
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,000
who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.

472
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:56,800
Every day he comes. He's very grateful. It'll just take a minute.

473
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,500
Mr. Lowenstein?

474
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,600
I want to thank you, sir,

475
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,400
for giving me the opportunity to work.

476
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,400
You're welcome. I'm sure you're doing a great job.

477
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,800
The SS beat me up. They would have killed me,

478
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:30,600
but I am essential to the war effort, thanks to you.

479
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
That's great.

480
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,300
I work hard for you.

481
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,400
I'm sure you do. I'll continue to work hard for you.

482
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,400
That's great. Thanks.

483
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,000
God bless you, sir. All right.

484
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,800
You are a good man.

485
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,300
He saved my life. Yes, he did.

486
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,200
God bless him. Yeah. Come on.

487
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,100
God bless you.

488
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm sorry, Herr Direktor, but you're running very late.

489
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,400
This is for the Obersturmbannfuehrer, sir.

490
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,400
And this is for his niece, Greta. It's her birthday.

491
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,200
Greta as in Garbo. By the way, don't ever do that to me again.

492
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,900
Go. Go, go, drive! Don't bow.

493
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,900
Did you happen to notice that that man had one arm? What? Did he?

494
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,200
What's his use? Very useful.

495
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,600
How? Very useful! Success!

496
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:56,200
##Achrar kach loe nedah ##

497
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,700
Besen und Schaufeln werden ausgeladen...

498
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,400
jeder nimmt sich eine und dann wird die Strasse gereinigt.

499
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,700
We'll be late for work.

500
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,100
You shouldn't think of them as yours, Oskar.

501
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,100
You need to understand that some of the officers here...

502
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,900
don't give a damn about production.

503
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,100
To them, it's a matter of, um, national priority...

504
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,500
that Jews be made to shovel snow.

505
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,100
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar.

506
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,200
You know it and I know it.

507
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,600
Jews shoveling snow--

508
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:58,400
It's got a, um, ritual significance.

509
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,500
Come with me. I am an essential worker.

510
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,300
Essential worker? Yes.

511
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,800
I work for Oskar Schindler. Essential worker for Oskar Schindler.

512
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,300
A one-armed Jew? Twice as useless! Yes, yes.

513
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,400
I lost a day of production, Rolf.

514
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,700
I work for Oskar Schindler.

515
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,800
Danka, look at the snow. Look at the snow. Look at the snow!

516
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,700
I lost a worker. I expect to be compensated.

517
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,700
File a grievance with the Economic Office. It's your right.

518
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,500
Would it do any good? Of course not.

519
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,700
A big shot from the SS Budget and Construction Office came to lunch...

520
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,400
and he told us that to believe the Jewish skilled worker had a place...

521
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,900
in Reich economics was a treasonable idea.

522
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:05,200
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

523
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,700
He was a metal press operator.

524
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,500
Quite skilled.

525
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,700
Herr Direktor?

526
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,100
Shit. I don't believe it.

527
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,400
Stern, is that you?

528
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,700
No, it's Poldek. It's about Stern.

529
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,600
Leave your luggage on the platform.

530
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,700
Clearly label it.

531
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,000
Given name first, then your surname.

532
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,700
Do not bring your baggage with you.

533
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,700
It will follow you later.

534
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,000
Leave your luggage on the platform.

535
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,100
Clearly label it.

536
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,100
Lassen Sie Ihr Gepaeck am Bahnsteig.

537
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Stern?

538
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,200
He's on the list. He is?

539
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,200
Well, let's find him. I'm sorry. You can't have him.

540
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,200
He's on the list. If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list.

541
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,000
I'm talking to a clerk. What is your name?

542
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,200
Sir, the list is correct. I didn't ask you about the list.

543
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,400
I asked you your name. Klaus Tauber.

544
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,700
Tauber.

545
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,700
Hauptscharfuehrer, this gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.

546
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,200
My plant manager is somewhere on this train.

547
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,400
If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production...

548
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,700
and the Armaments Board will want to know why.

549
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,100
Achtung, dieser Zug faehrt jetzt ab.

550
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:04,300
Is he on the list? Yes, sir. Itzhak Stern.

551
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,000
Well, the list is correct, sir. There is nothing I can do.

552
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,100
What is your name? Close and secure all doors.

553
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,700
My name? My name is Kunder. This train is now leaving.

554
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,200
Kunder. Hauptscharfuehrer Kunder.

555
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,200
K-U-N-D-E-R. And what's yours?

556
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,400
Schindler. S-C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R.

557
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,800
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

558
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,500
I think I can guarantee you you'll both be in...

559
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,300
Southern Russia before the end of the month. Good day.

560
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Zamykac dokladnie drzwi. Dokladnie zamykac drzwi.

561
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,500
Stern!

562
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,500
Stern! Stern!

563
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,500
Itzhak Stern!

564
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,500
Stern! Itzhak Stern!

565
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,400
Stern! Stern! Itzhak Stern!

566
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,000
Stern!

567
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,000
Sir?

568
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,400
Stern! Herr Direktor.

569
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,300
My apologies.

570
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,300
Stop the train! He's here! I apologize.

571
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,400
- Stop the train! - Stop the train! Stop it!

572
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,700
Sign here. Initial there.

573
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,900
Makes no difference to us, you understand. This one, that one.

574
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,500
It's the inconvenience to the list.

575
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,400
It's the paperwork. I somehow left my work card at home.

576
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,200
I tried to explain them it was a mistake, but--

577
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:48,400
I'm sorry, it was stupid! What if I got here five minutes later?

578
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,200
Then where would I be?

579
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,300
Shechel.

580
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,300
Sacrean, sacrean end tzukeer.

581
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,900
Tzukeer end sacrean.

582
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,200
I woke up from a dream this morning.

583
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:49,500
I was broke and sharing a room with 12 people I didn't know,

584
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,900
only to discover I was broke and sharing a room with 12 people I didn't know.

585
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,400
You laugh about it? I have to laugh.

586
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,400
You are living behind walls.

587
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:06,200
The walls I can deal with. It's the restrictions to my life I'm tired of.

588
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,400
Those walls keep them out. That's all I care about.

589
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,200
I like it here. There's a kind of, I don't know,

590
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,600
ancestral squalor to it all.

591
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,900
You are a slave to these people. No one envies us anymore.

592
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,100
I'm smart. Oh, yes, you're smart.

593
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,400
You're a real genius. You had your chance.

594
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:26,200
Today, today I actually found time to organize a thought.

595
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,100
I can't remember the last time I did that.

596
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,100
When's the last time we did this?

597
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,500
When's the last time we stood around and talked?

598
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,900
No one ordered me onto a truck today.

599
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,300
No one took my business away from me.

600
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,400
You don't really have a business to take.

601
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,800
There's nowhere down from here.

602
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,100
This is it. This is the bottom.

603
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,900
The ghetto is... liberty.

604
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,400
This street divides the ghetto just about in half.

605
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:04,900
Right side, Ghetto A: civil employees,

606
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,900
industrial workers and so on.

607
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:12,900
Left side, Ghetto B: surplus labor,

608
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,400
the elderly and infirm mostly.

609
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,500
Which is where you'll want to start, huh?

610
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,500
Do you have any questions, sir?

611
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,200
Ja, why is the top down? I'm fucking freezing.

612
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,100
We expect a labor force of 25,000 to 30,000.

613
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,200
Segregated, of course. The men in the barracks near the quarry.

614
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,600
The women on the other side of the wire.

615
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,200
My place is where? There, sir.

616
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,700
There? You call that a villa? Yes, the villa.

617
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,100
Their synagogue, can you see it? That's not a villa.

618
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,500
We're planning to turn it into the camp stables. It's a house.

619
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,400
What's that over there?

620
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,300
Kindergarten. Fifty-one.

621
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:56,900
And we have a dentist, shoemaker, practical physicians.

622
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,700
There they are, sir.

623
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,800
Hmm.

624
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,300
One of you is, uh, a very lucky girl.

625
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,200
There is an opening for a job,

626
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,200
away from all this... backbreaking work,

627
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,800
at my new villa.

628
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:26,500
Uh, which of you has...

629
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,400
domestic experience?

630
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:36,500
Ja, on second thought, I don't really want someone else's maid.

631
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:40,000
All those annoying habits I have to undo.

632
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,700
I don't want to give you my cold.

633
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,000
Uh, what's your name?

634
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,400
Helen Hirsch. What?

635
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,400
Helen Hirsch.

636
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,800
