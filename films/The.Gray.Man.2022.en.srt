If this is about Winky's Cantina,
I didn't have anything to do with it.

7
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:24,226
[man 2] It's not about Winky's Cantina.

[man 2] I'm not gonna write anything down.

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,393
You want some gum?

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,226
What kind you got?

00:00:41,435 --> 00:00:44,060
"Bubblicious Watermelon Wave."
What do you say?

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,185
There is no other kind.

00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,851
If you think I'm gonna rat somebody out
for Bubblicious,

17
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:56,810
you got another thing coming to you.

18

There's an upside
to sleeping so close to your toilet.

24
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:17,810
I get it. You're glib.

25
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:20,393
Well, I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

26
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:23,685
My name is Donald Fitzroy,
and I'm here to commute your sentence.

27

You're gonna commute my sentence?

28
00:01:26,143 --> 00:01:27,560
-[Fitzroy] Yes.
-Just like that?

29

When I get out of this chair
and walk out of this prison,

30
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:30,726
you'll walk with me.

32

No offense,
I thought you'd look different.

33
00:01:35,143 --> 00:01:36,393
I may be. We'll see.

34
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,268
What's the catch?

35
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:41,685
You work for us.

36
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,101
-[Gentry] Who's "us"?
-The CIA.

37
00:01:44,685 --> 00:01:46,476
We're gonna train you to kill bad guys.

38
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:50,060
And since you've already killed one,
it shouldn't be too difficult.

39
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,601
What makes you think I wanna do it again?

40
00:01:52,685 --> 00:01:54,435
You seem like the type.

41
00:01:56,226 --> 00:01:59,435
You'd be part of an elite unit,
the Sierra program.

42
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,601
You would exist in the gray.

43

44
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:08,435
I've studied your case.
I know why you pulled that trigger.

45
00:02:08,518 --> 00:02:10,518
I would've done the same thing myself.

46
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:15,310
Now, I'm here to help you become
a value-add instead of a value lost.

47
00:02:15,393 --> 00:02:18,351
So why don't you take all the pain
or whatever the hell got you here,

48
00:02:18,435 --> 00:02:20,976
turn it around, and make it useful?

49

How long do I gotta work for you?

50
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:30,685

you'd be indefinitely useful.

Six, this is Denny Carmichael,

Our target, code name "Dining Car,"

77
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:35,976
that could severely compromise
national security.

78
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,893
We need him eliminated before
that transaction is complete. Understood?

79
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:40,518
[Six] Understood.

80
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:43,060
Please explain to me
why I'm talking to a Sierra agent

81

instead of somebody
in our circle of trust.

104

[Dining Car] Get rid of them.

105
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:03,643
[buyer] Relax. Safer this way…

106
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:06,268
[Dining Car] Don't tell me to relax.
I want my money.

107
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,226
So just transfer it and get it done.

108

Do you understand the risk I've taken
by coming here?

109

You have no idea of the kind of people
you're gonna have to deal with,

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,185
Denny Carmichael is a piece of shit.

181
00:11:29,393 --> 00:11:32,018
That's why I'm sitting here
in my own blood.

182
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:35,018
-You're probably next.
-[grunts]

183
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:37,893
Hey.

184
00:11:39,268 --> 00:11:40,101
[sighs raggedly]

185
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:41,726
Take this

186
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,101
and bring the bastard down. [panting]

187
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:47,893
I don't want it.

188
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:50,185
You trust Carmichael?

189
00:11:53,101 --> 00:11:55,810
Just… take it.

190
00:11:58,268 --> 00:11:59,226
Please.

191
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,518
Okay, you know what?

192
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,726
There you go. I took it, okay?

193
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,185
You give 'em hell, Six.

194
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,685
[panting slowly]

195
00:12:11,393 --> 00:12:12,935
[panting stops]

196
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,018
Very discreet.

197
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:29,310
[Six] I thought this'd be cleaner.

198
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,268
[agent] It wasn't.

199
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:33,893
We're Romeo.

200
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:36,018
He said he was Sierra.

201
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:37,893
That wasn't in the mission folder.

202
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:39,893
He knew who I was.

203
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,935
[agent] Maybe he had access
to stolen intel.

204
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:46,143
I'm Sierra. There is no intel.

205
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:54,226
[man] It's ours now, agent.

206
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:57,143
Agent.

207
00:12:59,268 --> 00:13:00,101
I heard you.

208
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:06,226
I just chose to ignore you.

209
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:08,935
[enigmatic music plays]

210
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:11,018

216
00:13:28,185 --> 00:13:30,643
It's Dawson. I need Carmichael.

217
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:34,185
[Dawson] No joy. I repeat, no joy.

218
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:38,268
[Denny] This is why I wanted
the Sierra program made extinct.

219
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:40,851
I want nothing left from that old regime.

220
00:13:40,935 --> 00:13:43,560
These things take time, Denny.
There are politics to unravel.

221
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:45,310
-[Denny] Get out.
-What?

222
00:13:45,393 --> 00:13:48,101
Get out.

223
00:13:53,268 --> 00:13:56,143
[fireworks continue to pop]

224
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:58,768
[cell phone calling]

225
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:04,893
-Six.
-[Denny] Wanna explain whatever that was?

226
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,476
[Six] Gun jammed.

227
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,476
That doesn't qualify as an explanation.

228
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,351
[Six] Maybe on a secure line.

229
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:12,018
I need a status report.

230
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,310
Insecure line.

231
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:15,851
Did the target say anything to you?

232
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:16,893
Well, he was dead,

233
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:19,768
so, you know, no.

234
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:23,518
What about pocket litter?
Did you get anything off his body?

235
00:14:26,143 --> 00:14:29,810
Six, did he have anything on his person

236
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,601
that you now have
that you'd like to give to me?

237
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,643
Who was he?

238
00:14:37,851 --> 00:14:38,893
A bad guy.

239
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:40,976
-Carrying?
-Bad shit.

240
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,976
Last chance, Six.

241
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:48,268
Understood.

242
00:14:49,518 --> 00:14:50,351
Hey.

243
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,560
You a 42 regular?

Take the shot! [chuckles]

[cell phone vibrating]

249
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,643
Yeah.

250
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:39,893
Wheels up in five.
Carmichael's been calling.

251
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:41,685
[Six] We spoke.

252
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:43,893
You should go without me.

253
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:46,226
You sure you wanna do that?

254
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:49,685
What happened with the target, Six?

255
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:53,476
Tell me what I don't know.

256
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,185
Well, that's the problem, isn't it?

257
00:15:57,851 --> 00:16:01,101
[helicopter blades whir]

[solemn orchestral music plays]

259
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:13,435
[Six] Hey, pal.

260
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:16,810
Wanna trade?

261
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,601
[gamer speaks Thai]

262
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:31,351
[cell phone vibrates]

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,143
[Fitzroy] Max's Fireplace and Barbecue.

264
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,060
You Max?

265
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:36,685
There is no Max.

266
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:39,310
-So it's like "to the max"?
-Yeah.

267
00:16:39,393 --> 00:16:41,393
Why didn't you just say that
in the first place?

268
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:43,976
Because if something went wrong,
I couldn't blame Max.

269
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,351
-How you doing, Fitz?
-It's good to hear from you, kid.

270
00:16:47,435 --> 00:16:49,226
How's life in retirement?

271
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,518
I'm headed to a funeral.
Putting a friend in the ground.

272
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:52,976
I'm getting to that age, you know?

273
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,601
-You working?
-[Six] I was.

274
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:56,101
-Got loud?
-[Six] It got loud.

275
00:16:56,185 --> 00:16:57,726
Got real weird too.

276
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,101
You know that guy
that handed you your walking papers?

277
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,476
Yeah, Carmichael.

278
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,893
Well, brace yourself,
but, uh, he might be sideways.

279
00:17:04,976 --> 00:17:06,101
I'm shocked.

280
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:07,518
What's your gut?

281
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:10,143
My gut? It's gonna be my funeral
you're going to next.

282
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:12,726
Give me an hour
to find a local extraction team.

283
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,601
Get mobile. You may have to hustle.

284
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:18,143
Let me ask you a question.
Four have a scar on his right chin?

285
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:19,310
Yeah.

286
00:17:19,393 --> 00:17:21,976
-They just had me stick a fork in him.
-Pretense?

287
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,768
Some foreign op bullshit.
You know they don't tell me much.

288
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,101
He gave me something they really want.

289
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:29,101
On person?

290
00:17:30,268 --> 00:17:32,143
No. Somewhere safe.

291
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:33,060
Good boy.

292
00:17:33,851 --> 00:17:37,018
Well, I'll do some checking.
I still have friends up the food chain.

293
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:39,060
-Where are ya?
-Bangkok.

294
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:43,393
There's an airfield near Chiang Mai.
Get to it. Watch your back.

295
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:44,310
You too.

296
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,893
Hey, Fitz,

297
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:50,476
I know there wasn't some
palm trees 401k plan for me, but, uh,

298
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:55,435
I mean, at least tell me
you guys had some kind of exit strategy.

299
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:57,768
We never got that far, kid.

300
00:17:58,268 --> 00:18:00,643
And now, probably not.

301
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:02,851
Got it.

302
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:03,768
I'm sorry.

303
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:05,976
I'll be in touch.

I can see everything from here.

-He's got it.
-Not necessarily.

314
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,560
[Denny] Yes, necessarily.

315
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:48,851
That knuckle-dragger sweated me
on the phone. He knows.

316
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,268
So…

317
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:56,185
Never should have touched Fitzroy's guys.
They're all criminals.

318
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,393
[agent] You through?

319
00:18:58,393 --> 00:18:59,268
What do you wanna do?

320
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:01,268
What we should have done from the start.

321
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:03,768
-No, no, absolutely not.
-You had your shot. [exhales]

322
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,935
Lloyd Hansen is a sociopath.

323
00:19:06,018 --> 00:19:08,351
-You say that like it's a bad thing.
-It's a dangerous thing.

324
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:10,768
-He has methods.
-Sociopathic methods.

325
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:14,310
So sit on him. The guy has a higher
kill count than the entire Mossad.

326
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:17,101

I turned it off at halftime.
They ran us off the field.

-Five and a half.

[urgent menacing music playing]

883
00:51:26,393 --> 00:51:27,685
We need to ground in Vienna.

884
00:51:28,268 --> 00:51:30,643
We haven't filed a flight plan.
They'll never clear us.

885
00:51:30,726 --> 00:51:32,101
So declare an emergency.

886
00:51:32,185 --> 00:51:34,393
There are weapons on board.
I'll lose my license.

887
00:51:35,643 --> 00:51:38,726
We have a filed alternate near Budapest.
Best I can do is call them.

888
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:40,851
[pilot shouts painfully]

889
00:51:41,935 --> 00:51:43,726
How do you feel about your license?

890
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,768
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday,
This is November Three…

891
00:51:47,851 --> 00:51:49,726
Who's up for some Tafelspitz?

892
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,310
[grunting]

893
00:51:56,935 --> 00:51:58,351
[Denny] Stick around the building.

894
00:51:58,435 --> 00:52:00,643
The boys aren't done
searching your apartment yet.

895
00:52:03,601 --> 00:52:04,476
[door closes]

896
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,601
[grunting]

897
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,101
[urgent music continues]

898
00:52:13,185 --> 00:52:16,643
[tires screech]

899
00:53:05,726 --> 00:53:07,476
I would have opened it.

900
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,143
[whispers] Where's the target?

901
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,476
Where's my money?

902
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,768
[menacing music playing]

903
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,851
[mercenary] He got caught in the well.

904
00:53:48,268 --> 00:53:49,435
[shouting]

905
00:53:55,518 --> 00:53:56,685
[wet rapid footsteps]

906
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:01,185
[gunshots]

907
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,851
[both grunting]

908
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,018
[cries out in pain]

909
00:54:18,018 --> 00:54:19,601
[blow thuds heavily]

910
00:54:20,435 --> 00:54:21,601
[spray hisses]

911
00:54:21,685 --> 00:54:23,435
Come on, man.

912
00:54:23,518 --> 00:54:24,810
Hey, sunshine.

913
00:54:24,893 --> 00:54:28,143
-[grunts] You must be Lloyd.
-What gave it away?

914
00:54:28,226 --> 00:54:30,685
The white pants, the trash 'stache.
It just…

915
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,393
-It leans Lloyd.
-[sighs, chuckles]

916
00:54:34,851 --> 00:54:36,018
Where's the drive?

917
00:54:36,101 --> 00:54:38,435
I got it here somewhere.
It's just hard to see.

918
00:54:39,101 --> 00:54:41,185
-[clears throat] Is that it?
-[clicks]

919
00:54:42,476 --> 00:54:43,851
[panting]

920
00:54:43,935 --> 00:54:44,976
Ballsy.

921
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,060
[suspenseful music builds]

922
00:54:50,976 --> 00:54:53,935
[growls, groans]

923

[silenced gunfire]

924
00:55:08,643 --> 00:55:09,601
Nice try, pumpkin.

925
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:11,226
What size shoe are you?

926
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:13,560
-Why? You want my foot in your ass?
-[projectile whistles]

927
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,393
Ah, shit!

928
00:55:18,518 --> 00:55:19,476
Mother--

929
00:55:25,518 --> 00:55:26,351
Looks like an 11.

930
00:55:27,393 --> 00:55:28,643
[Miranda] Who's this lunatic?

931
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:30,476
I don't know. Lloyd.

932
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,393
-Let's go.
-[Six] I'm good.

933
00:55:32,935 --> 00:55:34,310
Let's go.

934
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:36,226
It sounded like a question.

935
00:55:38,143 --> 00:55:39,185
[groans]

936
00:55:39,685 --> 00:55:42,310
-How'd you find me?
-You make a lot of noise.

937
00:55:42,393 --> 00:55:43,476
Hey.

938
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,685
Open it.

939
00:55:44,768 --> 00:55:47,101
[sirens approach in distance]

940
00:55:52,518 --> 00:55:54,101
-Not the trunk.
-Get in.

941
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:56,268
I could really use a comfortable chair
right now.

942
00:55:56,851 --> 00:56:00,268
[groaning, chuckles]

943
00:56:05,101 --> 00:56:07,435
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

944
00:56:20,435 --> 00:56:22,851
[helicopter blades whir]

945
00:56:40,393 --> 00:56:41,851
[whispers] Is that Donald Fitzroy?

946
00:56:42,435 --> 00:56:43,851
What the hell are you doing?

947
00:56:43,935 --> 00:56:47,101
[Lloyd] Suzanne! Long time.
If I'm honest, I liked your old haircut.

948
00:56:47,185 --> 00:56:48,726
Where you didn't look like a bitch.

949
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:49,976
We did not give you permission

950
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:53,185
to kidnap former CIA personnel
and their family members.

951
00:56:53,268 --> 00:56:55,435
You've been hired
by the agency to recover–

952
00:56:55,518 --> 00:56:57,643
To do your job because you couldn't.

953
00:56:57,726 --> 00:56:59,226
Can someone get me a Vicodin, please?

954
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:01,351
-So where is Six?
-Where I want him.

955
00:57:01,435 --> 00:57:04,101
-In the wind?
-On the run, scared shitless.

956
00:57:04,185 --> 00:57:06,935
This is ten years of my work
on the line here, Lloyd--

957
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:11,476
I am your only prayer
of getting that drive back

958
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,310
because I can do
everything the agency can't.

959
00:57:14,393 --> 00:57:17,935
You know all those rules you guys
are always trying to work your way around?

960
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:20,018
They don't mean dick to me.

961
00:57:20,101 --> 00:57:22,976
So unless you want our names
spilled across every news alert

962
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,935
on every phone in every pocket on Earth,

963
00:57:25,018 --> 00:57:27,518
shut up and go sit in the corner.

964
00:57:31,101 --> 00:57:33,185
-Oh.
-[pills rattle]

965
00:57:33,268 --> 00:57:34,393
How about that?

966
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:36,810
Forget about the Vicodin.

967
00:57:39,101 --> 00:57:40,768
Why are you walking like that?

968
00:57:40,851 --> 00:57:43,185
[Lloyd] 'Cause I got shot
in the ass, Suzanne!

969
00:57:46,643 --> 00:57:47,893
[Fitzroy] Hey, sweetheart.

970
00:57:48,601 --> 00:57:51,018
[Claire gasps, sobs]

971
00:57:55,018 --> 00:57:57,601
-[Fitzroy] I'm so sorry.
-[whimpers]

972
00:57:57,685 --> 00:57:58,810
I know, honey.

973
00:58:00,893 --> 00:58:01,810
I'm sorry.

974
00:58:01,893 --> 00:58:03,893
[police siren wailing]

975
00:58:08,476 --> 00:58:11,393
-[banging]
-[Six grunting]

976
00:58:14,226 --> 00:58:16,018
[growling]

977
00:58:16,101 --> 00:58:18,976
[inhales, exhales]

978
00:58:19,601 --> 00:58:21,435
-[sighs]
-You look like shit.

979
00:58:22,226 --> 00:58:24,143
That's the most sleep I've had
in 36 hours.

980
00:58:24,226 --> 00:58:25,893
They pulled me from field duty.

981
00:58:26,393 --> 00:58:29,351
They think I'm into whatever you're into.
You're gonna tell them I'm not.

982
00:58:29,435 --> 00:58:31,351
What gives the impression
they care what I think?

983
00:58:31,435 --> 00:58:33,435
This is my career, you understand?

984
00:58:34,101 --> 00:58:38,185
You're just an asset,
but it's my career, my reputation.

985
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:39,310
What did you steal?

986
00:58:39,393 --> 00:58:41,976
Technically, I didn't steal anything.
Four gave it to me.

987
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,893
-Then why didn't you give it to HQ?
-Well, he gave it to me.

988
00:58:44,976 --> 00:58:47,226
-[Miranda] What did he give you?
-An encrypted drive.

989
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:48,226
What's on it?

990
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:49,226
It's encrypted.

991
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:50,643
-I wanna see it.
-I don't have it.

992
00:58:50,726 --> 00:58:52,851
-Where is it?
-How do I know I can trust you?

993
00:58:52,935 --> 00:58:55,018
[Miranda] Because I just saved your life.

994
00:58:56,268 --> 00:58:57,685
That's a fair point.

995
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:02,226
I sent it to Margaret Cahill,
the U.K. Agency Chief, okay?

996
00:59:02,976 --> 00:59:04,935
She retired and lives in Prague.

997
00:59:08,435 --> 00:59:09,310
What are you thinking?

998
00:59:09,393 --> 00:59:12,518
-[Miranda] I'm thinking about what to do.
-Maybe think about it this way.

999
00:59:13,101 --> 00:59:14,518
They already had me kill an agent.

1000
00:59:14,601 --> 00:59:16,851
Now it's my turn.
How do you know you're not next?

1001
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,060
Get comfortable.

1002
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:26,143
[tense music playing]

1003
00:59:28,185 --> 00:59:29,893
"Get comfortable"
like we're going to Prague,

1004
00:59:29,976 --> 00:59:32,518
or… or, like, jail comfortable?

1005
00:59:33,101 --> 00:59:34,060
[tires screech]

1006
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:45,060
[Lloyd] Where are we? What do we got?

1007
00:59:45,143 --> 00:59:46,768
[tech] Wet teams en route.

1008
00:59:47,768 --> 00:59:50,185
Everybody be advised, he has help.

1009
00:59:50,768 --> 00:59:51,601
We sure?

1010
00:59:51,685 --> 00:59:54,476
Well, I didn't tranq myself in the ass,
so yes.

1011
00:59:55,643 --> 00:59:59,726
[tech 2] Got something.
CCTV in Bangkok. Night of the op.

1012
01:00:02,351 --> 01:00:03,601
[Suzanne] He ditched the asset.

1013
01:00:03,685 --> 01:00:06,393
-Where's that package now?
-[tech 2] It's already in the system.

1014
01:00:06,476 --> 01:00:08,810
Resolution's too shitty
to read the address.

1015
01:00:08,893 --> 01:00:11,101
Clerk said it was to a PO box in Prague.

1016
01:00:11,185 --> 01:00:13,518
He doesn't keep any records,
so that's the best we got.

1017
01:00:13,601 --> 01:00:16,060
That'll do, pig. That'll do.

1018
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:20,518
Goldilocks, would you be a lamb
and excuse us?

1019
01:00:20,601 --> 01:00:21,435
Go to hell.

1020
01:00:21,935 --> 01:00:22,935
Hey! Whoa! Stop!

1021
01:00:23,018 --> 01:00:25,060
-She has a pacemaker, jackass!
-[Claire] Hey, whoa!

1022
01:00:25,143 --> 01:00:26,601
Get off me! No! Stop!

1023
01:00:26,685 --> 01:00:29,143
Then she definitely shouldn't stick around
for this next part.

1024
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:31,768
If you hurt her, I will annihilate you.

1025
01:00:31,851 --> 01:00:34,226
-Do you understand me?
-[shushes]

1026
01:00:35,101 --> 01:00:37,810
-Please.
-[grunts]

1027
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:47,101
Who's in Prague?

1028
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,810
There's three million people in Prague.
I don't know all their names.

1029
01:00:49,893 --> 01:00:52,976
Right. Well, you see,
your boy mailed a package,

1030
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:55,393
which means,
with countless contacts at his disposal,

1031
01:00:55,476 --> 01:00:58,268
and this being
a particularly challenging situation,

1032
01:00:58,768 --> 01:01:02,060
there's someone in Prague
that he trusts the most.

1033
01:01:07,726 --> 01:01:08,560
Who is that?

1034
01:01:08,643 --> 01:01:09,560
It's your mother.

1035
01:01:09,643 --> 01:01:10,476
[Lloyd] Boring.

1036
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:13,726
[Donald grunting]

1037
01:01:16,226 --> 01:01:17,476
[both grunt]

[Lloyd sighs]

1039
01:01:20,435 --> 01:01:21,435
Happy?

1040
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:27,018
Now, whatever I just did to your ears,
it's not even torture.

1041
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,851
I just made it up on the spot.
Just came to me.

1042
01:01:29,935 --> 01:01:32,351
-Oh.
-[Lloyd] And that's how this is gonna go.

1043
01:01:42,935 --> 01:01:47,060
[chair scraping on floor]

1044
01:01:52,393 --> 01:01:54,018
-Who's in Prague?
-Nobody.

1045
01:01:54,101 --> 01:01:54,976
Boring.

1046
01:01:56,226 --> 01:01:57,268
[Donald groaning]

1047
01:01:58,976 --> 01:02:01,935
[groaning continues]

-[nail detaches]
-[groans, laughs]

1049
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:08,976
-Should we try again?
-Okay, fine.

1050
01:02:12,726 --> 01:02:13,643
Who's in Prague?

1051
01:02:14,226 --> 01:02:16,185
-I already told you, I don't know.
-Boring.

1052
01:02:16,268 --> 01:02:19,310
[loud pained groaning]

1053
01:02:21,893 --> 01:02:22,935

What happened?

1232
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:45,226
The relay antenna must have snapped off.

1233
01:13:47,226 --> 01:13:48,310
Well, get it back on

1234
01:13:48,393 --> 01:13:50,893
before I beat you to death
with that keyboard.

[suspenseful rhythm continues]

1236
01:13:56,185 --> 01:13:57,351
Anybody got eyes on him?

1237
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:01,393
[mercenary]
Negative, negative. We lost him.

[tram bell ringing]

1239
01:14:12,643 --> 01:14:13,685
He's on the tram!

All teams, report status.

1264
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:18,101
This is quite possibly
the most spectacular failure

1265
01:18:18,726 --> 01:18:20,685
in the history of covert ops.

1266
01:18:22,601 --> 01:18:26,351
This will be taught in schools
as the primary example

1267
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:30,268
of exactly what not to do
in asset retrieval.

[man] This is Lone Wolf. Over.

1270
01:18:38,518 --> 01:18:40,351
Hello, my sexy Tamil friend.

1271
01:18:40,435 --> 01:18:42,018
Sit rep?

Tracking the target.

1273
01:18:43,935 --> 01:18:45,185
No change, Lone Wolf.

1274
01:18:46,685 --> 01:18:47,810
Get me that asset.

[breathes heavily]

1276
01:18:52,393 --> 01:18:54,143

You hurt?

1280
01:19:08,601 --> 01:19:10,351
I mean, my ego's a little bruised.

1281
01:19:10,851 --> 01:19:13,518
I would like the opportunity
to save you at some point.

1282
01:19:14,643 --> 01:19:16,935
Not that I want you to be in danger
so I can save you.

1283
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:19,685
-You said they have a girl.
-Yeah.

1284
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:21,268
How do we find her?

1285
01:19:23,685 --> 01:19:24,976
[Six] She's got a pacemaker.

1286
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,185

Can you please get us a doctor?
My husband's injured.

1291
01:19:42,351 --> 01:19:44,768
-You have to wait in the lobby.
-No, we have been waiting.

1292
01:19:44,851 --> 01:19:47,101
-I'm sorry.
-[Miranda] I need someone to see him now.

1293
01:19:47,185 --> 01:19:48,018
[woman] I understand.

1294
01:19:48,101 --> 01:19:49,893
[Miranda] How much longer
do we need to wait?

You know, you have ten fingers.

Yeah, and a few cans of pepper spray
in my eyes.

1300
01:20:18,726 --> 01:20:23,393
And you can't all caps on this thing.
You have to control shift. It's a process.

-[taps keys]

1302
01:20:26,601 --> 01:20:27,518
There.

1303
01:20:27,601 --> 01:20:28,768
She's in Croatia.

1304
01:20:29,476 --> 01:20:31,018
I mean, I can see that.

1305
01:20:32,101 --> 01:20:33,476
It's not in Croatian.

1306
01:20:33,976 --> 01:20:36,435

[Six] You were in my shot.

1351

You gave me an empty gun?

1352
01:23:37,601 --> 01:23:39,435
-[Six] The shells were coming, okay?
-Huh?

1353
01:23:39,518 --> 01:23:41,726
The shells were coming.
You… You ran away too fast.

1354
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:44,143
[Miranda] Then you need to say,
"Hey, wait! That's empty."

1355
01:23:44,226 --> 01:23:45,185
No, it's assumed.

1356
01:23:45,268 --> 01:23:48,143
I assumed it's loaded,
so I ran after the guy.

1357

-Who throws a loaded gun?
-I asked for a loaded gun.

1358

Are you coming?

[growls, sighs]

1360

I'm gonna bleed out

Can we just unpack this somewhere else?

[Denny, over phone]
Jesus Christ, Suzanne!

1363
01:24:08,268 --> 01:24:09,101
I warned you.

1364
01:24:09,185 --> 01:24:11,185
When I said, "Sit on Lloyd,"
I meant sit on him,

1365
01:24:11,268 --> 01:24:12,435
not "torch half of Europe."

1366
01:24:12,518 --> 01:24:14,643
-He is unsittable.
-Do you have the drive?

1367
01:24:14,726 --> 01:24:16,393
Not in possession. No, it's en route.

1368
01:24:16,476 --> 01:24:17,435
What about Six?

1369
01:24:17,518 --> 01:24:19,435
Bleeding and MIA.

1370
01:24:20,101 --> 01:24:22,560
-Have you heard from the old man?
-No, not yet.

1371
01:24:22,643 --> 01:24:26,685
Doesn't mean he doesn't know.
"Prague on fire" is hard to keep a lid on.

1372
01:24:26,768 --> 01:24:27,935
What are you gonna tell him?

1373
01:24:28,018 --> 01:24:29,351
The truth, Suzanne.

1374
01:24:29,435 --> 01:24:31,268
That you hired Lloyd Hansen?

1375
01:24:31,351 --> 01:24:33,685
That truth or some other truth?

1376
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:35,435

and we can go.

1386
01:25:17,185 --> 01:25:18,351
Why'd you go to prison?

1387
01:25:19,226 --> 01:25:20,268
Why do you ask?

1388
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:21,810
'Cause I wanna know.

1389
01:25:22,935 --> 01:25:25,060
[Six] Will it affect
whether you help me or not?

1390
01:25:25,143 --> 01:25:26,101
[Miranda] Maybe.

1391
01:25:26,185 --> 01:25:27,310
That's fair enough.

1392

Well… [sniffs]

1398
01:25:46,185 --> 01:25:49,476
…my father fancied himself
a real macho man.

1399
01:25:51,976 --> 01:25:57,768
And he was hell-bent on turning me
and my brother into the same.

1400
01:26:02,476 --> 01:26:05,560
Unfortunately, his methods
were a little unsound,

1401
01:26:07,018 --> 01:26:08,018
and, uh…

1402
01:26:09,726 --> 01:26:13,935
he started laying into my brother so hard

1403
01:26:15,101 --> 01:26:16,643
that at a certain point,

1404
01:26:17,726 --> 01:26:20,226
it was clear
it was either gonna be my brother or him.

[muffled shouting and thuds]

01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:25,935
[man, shouting]
You think you can do it without me?

1408
01:26:26,018 --> 01:26:27,435
You can't!

1409
01:26:28,976 --> 01:26:30,518
I decided it would be him.

1410
01:26:31,435 --> 01:26:33,435
[soft pensive music plays]

1411
01:26:35,018 --> 01:26:37,935
I thought, "How noble of me,"

1412
01:26:39,018 --> 01:26:42,935
and, uh,
everyone else thought I should be in jail.

1413
01:26:47,601 --> 01:26:50,018
And that's the way it was
until Fitzroy found me.

That's better.

1418
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:13,101
So what do you say?

1419
01:27:16,476 --> 01:27:17,935
We gonna do this or not?

1420

[helicopter passing overhead]

1421
01:27:25,435 --> 01:27:26,851
He's coming for us, isn't he?

1422
01:27:27,851 --> 01:27:31,310
If he can walk, honey, it'll be
through those double doors over there.

1429
01:28:14,601 --> 01:28:16,185
[Lloyd] You know what I love about you?

1430
01:28:16,268 --> 01:28:19,851
You look like you've been hit by a bus,
but it only adds to your mystique.

It's loading.

1447
01:29:17,268 --> 01:29:20,268
Tell me, Suzanne, is there any other part
of your job that I can do for you?

1448
01:29:20,351 --> 01:29:22,935
Failing upwards
does not qualify as success.

1449
01:29:23,018 --> 01:29:25,268
No, success qualifies as success.

1450
01:29:25,351 --> 01:29:28,601
Do you consider putting a bullet
in the girl upstairs a success?

1451
01:29:28,685 --> 01:29:31,518
'Cause I'm struggling to see
how you're gonna get out of all this.

You're killing a girl?

1454

You know, in English,
we call this a happy ending.

1455
01:29:43,476 --> 01:29:47,226
However, if you say one more word,
you may not see it that way.

1456
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:50,851
Suzanne, please pay my Tamil friend
and send him on his way.

1457

01:31:45,393 --> 01:31:49,018
Well, I can walk, but, uh, missing a wing.

-With this wing.

Took you long enough.

don't you think?

Keep him talking. I have line of sight.

1592
01:40:35,101 --> 01:40:39,435
You're gonna throw me that gun,
or the little one gets a new face.

1593
01:40:40,393 --> 01:40:43,101
If your strategy relies
on whether or not I'll kill a child,

1594
01:40:43,185 --> 01:40:44,601
you need a new strategy.

we would have been friends, you and I.

Aside from your childish sense of morality
and eight-dollar haircut,

1601

we have a lot in common.

1602

It's really a shame
this isn't gonna work out between us.

to lick my wounds and split,

1606

since the very beginning.

And now I just don't think
I can walk away.

Guess what I'm thinking right now.

1609

That you've overshared.

1610

I think I'm better than you.

1611

-No, no, wait.
-[Six] Yeah.

in the history of this agency.

01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:39,435
That a rogue independent contractor
as morally dubious as Lloyd Hansen

1704
