1
00:00:57,865 --> 00:01:00,283
Well, the thing I've been asking myself is ...

2
00:01:00,286 --> 00:01:05,138
What kinda sick individual names a street Edgewood Way ...

3
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:07,860
and then put it half a mile away from Edgewood Lane?

4
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:12,134
Crazy.

5
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:18,999
Got me out in this creepy, confusing-ass suburb.

6
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:25,372
Serious though. I feel here like a sore thumb out here.

7
00:01:26,945 --> 00:01:31,151
Alright man, alright, talk to you soon. See ya.

8
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,428
Okay, so this is the Rhine Ave.

9
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:42,483
It's like a fucking hedge maze out here.

10
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,911
Okay, let's see, east ...

11
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:49,200
Keep going straight, and then ...

12
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:53,658
I think he said the left on, what was that, Peacock?

13
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:58,764
Go straight, then left on ...

14
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:20,477
I just keep on walking. I don't do nothing stupid. Just keep on...

15
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,849
Fuck this, I'm going fucking go the other way I came.

16
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:28,831
Not today. Not me.

17
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:33,197
You know how they like to do motherfuckers out here. Man, I'm gone.

18
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:44,610
Come on. This is ... Help.

19
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,695
Quality over Quantity Releases Get Out

20
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,640
You're so cute. How is it going over there?

21
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:45,724
Good.

22
00:06:46,192 --> 00:06:49,690
You've got your toothbrush? - Yes.

23
00:06:49,996 --> 00:06:53,405
Do you have your deodorant? - Check.

24
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:57,525
Do you have your cozy clothes? - Got that.

25
00:07:00,205 --> 00:07:04,570
Can you give me a minute, Sid? We gotta pry something out of your dad.

26
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:10,193
What?

27
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,265
Do they know... Do they know I'm black?

28
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:22,936
No.

29
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:26,311
Should they?

30
00:07:29,052 --> 00:07:30,655
It seems like...

31
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:34,587
something you might want to know ...

32
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:37,636
Mention.

33
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,675
"Mom and Dad, my uh, my black boyfriend will be coming up this weekend ...

34
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:47,976
and I just don't want you to be shocked because he's a blackman. "Black ...

35
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,364
You said I was the first black guy you ever dated? Yeah, so what?

36
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:53,578
Yeah, so this is uncharted territory for them.

37
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:56,162
You know I don't want to be chased off the lawn with a shotgun.

38
00:07:56,571 --> 00:08:01,227
You're not going to. First of all, my dad would have voted for Obama a third time if he could have.

39
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:03,519
Like, the love is so real.

40
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:06,855
I'm only telling you that because he is definitely going to want to talk to you about that...

41
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:09,298
and it will definitely fucking suck.

42
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:13,033
But that's because he's a lame dad more than anything else.

43
00:08:13,931 --> 00:08:15,849
They are not racist.

44
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:20,022
I would have told you.

45
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:24,940
I wouldn't be bringing you home to them. Think about that for just two seconds.

46
00:08:24,943 --> 00:08:27,169
I'm thinking.Yeah, yeah, yeah good.

47
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:44,904
I'm a grown man ... - No way.

48
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:46,179
You broke my cigarette.

49
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,128
Really? You just threw it out. - Not really.

50
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:51,232
That was a dollar. You basically threw a dollar out the window.

51
00:08:51,235 --> 00:08:54,632
Well, that was a dollar you decided to spend on nicotine and tobacco.

52
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,452
Hold on, I've got to call Rod.

53
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:00,077
Don't, don't, don't do that.

54
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:03,715
Whasup?

55
00:09:03,718 --> 00:09:06,234
Yo, you at work? - Yeah, yeah, I'm at work.

56
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,915
Look, look Chris, tell me this okay?

57
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:13,705
How can I get in trouble for patting down an old lady? It's standard procedure.

58
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:18,597
Gary just thinks if an elderly bitch is elderly, she can't hijack no motherfucking plane.

59
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,387
See, wait, wait, now, I know you're laughing.

60
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,528
I'm serious, man. The next 9/11 is going to be on some geriatric shit.

61
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:28,906
Look man thanks for looking after Sid this weekend. Remember no human food.

62
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:32,109
He's go, he's got IBS. - Damn, see give me some type of credit.

63
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:34,286
Okay, I don't forget shit. You do.

64
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,466
No, I accept your apology. It's all good.

65
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:42,090
How's little Miss Rosie? - It's okay. She rides.

66
00:09:42,093 --> 00:09:43,378
Let me talk to him. - No.

67
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:45,121
I'd like to talk to him please?

68
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:47,099
Hold on, hold on.

69
00:09:47,783 --> 00:09:50,978
Hi, Rod. - Look here, you know you picked the wrong guy, right?

70
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:53,869
Oh yeah of course I know that. This is all just a ploy to get you.

71
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:56,461
It's not too late for us. - Okay, okay, get your own girl.

72
00:09:56,464 --> 00:09:58,883
It don't matter, because you never take my advice.

73
00:09:58,886 --> 00:09:59,991
At what?

74
00:09:59,994 --> 00:10:02,275
Like don't go to a white girl parents house.

75
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:04,575
What she doing, licking your balls or something?

76
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,100
Goodbye. - You know what I'm saying, Chris?

77
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:13,624
That bastard hung up on me.

78
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:18,443
You're jealous. - I'm not jealous.

79
00:10:18,446 --> 00:10:21,397
I made you jealous. It's Rod. - I'm not jealous of Rod.

80
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:39,913
You okay? - Yeah, that scared the shit out of me, and you?

81
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,336
Yes.

82
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:05,689
Stay here. - What? What are you doing?

83
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,102
I don't know. I...

84
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:13,588
Well maybe it's gone you know...

85
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:13,397
So in the future, the number to call is Animal Control Services.

86
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:17,585
Yes sorry. I was just disoriented.

87
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:20,106
So you guys, uh, come out from the city?

88
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:25,321
Yeah, yeah. My parents are from the Lake Pontaco area. We're just heading up there for the weekend.

89
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:28,951
Sir, can I see your license, please? - Wait, why?

90
00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:31,453
Yeah... I have a state ID.

91
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:33,567
No, no, no. He wasn't driving.

92
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,714
I didn't ask who was driving. I asked to see his ID.

93
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:39,748
Yeah, why? That doesn't make any sense. - Here.

94
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:43,471
No, no, no. Fuck that. You don't have to give him your ID because you haven't done anything wrong.

95
00:12:43,474 --> 00:12:44,850
Baby, baby, it's okay. Come on.

96
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:49,672
Anytime there is an incident we have every right to ask... - That's bullshit.

97
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:52,226
Ma'am, the ...

98
00:12:57,288 --> 00:12:58,828
Everything alright, Ryan?

99
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:02,986
Yeah, I'm good.

100
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,875
Get that headlight fixed. And that mirror.

101
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:13,147
Thank you officer.

102
00:13:22,286 --> 00:13:25,079
What? - That was hot.

103
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:28,080
I'm not, I'm not going to let anyone fuck with my man.

104
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,306
I see that.

105
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:34,055
We're here.

106
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,756
That's the groundskeeper.

107
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:02,795
Are you ready?

108
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:16,397
Hi. - There's my little girl. Come here.

109
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,179
How are you? - I love you too. I've missed you.

110
00:14:20,182 --> 00:14:21,937
This is my Dad, Dean. This is Chris.

111
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,216
Call me Mr. Armitage. - Of course. I...

112
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:27,716
I'm kidding. You call me Dean and you hug me, my man.

113
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:29,293
How are you? - Good. How are you?

114
00:14:29,296 --> 00:14:30,674
We're huggers. - Yes.

115
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:32,305
This is my Mom. This is Chris.

116
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,584
Welcome.

117
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:36,401
Nice to meet you.

118
00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:41,132
Your father is very excited. Anyway, yeah, Missy.

119
00:14:41,857 --> 00:14:44,785
Come on in, please. Welcome to our house.

120
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,584
How was your drive in? - It was fine.

121
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:55,295
We actually hit a deer. - What? - Oh, nooo...

122
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:56,982
Was it dead? - Yeah.

123
00:14:56,985 --> 00:14:59,511
Oh, that's horrible. Are you guys alright?

124
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:02,263
Yeah, it just shook us up. - Really?

125
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:04,518
Yeah, it came out of nowhere. We got it pretty good.

126
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:06,681
Yeah, it must have frucked you out.

127
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:10,383
Shit, frucking weird. But you know what I say?

128
00:15:10,715 --> 00:15:13,916
I say, one down, a couple hundred thousand to go.

129
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:18,702
No, I don't mean to get on my high horse, but I'm telling you I do not like the deer.

130
00:15:18,705 --> 00:15:21,503
I'm sick of it. They're taking over. They're like rats.

131
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:26,361
They're destroy the ecosystem. If I see a dead deer on the side of the road, I think to myself that's a start.

132
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,675
I don't even understand that. I'm sorry. - I'm just saying.

133
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:33,874
You know what? I am grateful for what you have done today. I don't like them.

134
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:35,738
We got that.

135
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:40,028
Yeah ... - You guys look so wiped out.

136
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,709
Yeah, yeah, a little.

137
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:47,035
so how long has this been going on? This, this thing?

138
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:49,913
How long?

139
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:53,556
Four months. - Four months.

140
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:56,849
Uh, five months, actually.

141
00:15:57,226 --> 00:15:58,854
She's right. -No problem.

142
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,381
That a boy. Better get used to saying that.

143
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:05,076
I ... Please. I'm so sorry.

144
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:07,016
Oh yeah, I'm sorry. She's right. I'm wrong.

145
00:16:07,908 --> 00:16:08,940
See?

146
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:11,524
Does he have an off button? This is exhausting.

147
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:13,225
No. I want to give you a tour.

148
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:14,944
They just ... - Can we unpack first?

149
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:17,491
You want to unpack? Before the tour?

150
00:16:19,098 --> 00:16:22,731
This is Missy's office. She takes appointments in there.

151
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:25,338
She's a therapist, right? - Psychiatrist, yeah.

152
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:29,397
Yeah, it turns out people up here are just as messed up in the head as they are in the city.

153
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,463
This is Jeremy. This is Rose's little brother.

154
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:33,936
I've heard stories.

155
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:39,180
Yeah, I bet you have. He's studying medicine now. Wants to be just like his old man.

156
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:41,084
You'll meet him. - Alright, cool.

157
00:16:42,108 --> 00:16:44,509
Picked these up in Bali.

158
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:48,870
That's pretty eclectic. I'm a...

159
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:54,991
I'm a traveler and I can't help it. I keep bringing souvenirs back.

160
00:16:54,994 --> 00:17:00,819
It's such a privilege to be able to experience another person's culture. Know what I'm saying?

161
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,942
Here, you're going to love this. My Dad's claim to fame.

162
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:11,353
He was beat by Jesse Owens in the qualifying round for the Berlin Olympics in 1936.

163
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:13,487
Those were the ones where ... - Owens won in front of Hitler.

164
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:19,715
Yes, what a moment, what a moment. I mean, Hitler's up there with all his perfect Aryan race bullshit.

165
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:24,169
This black dude comes along and proves him wrong in front of the entire whole world. Amazing.

166
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:29,309
Not great for your dad, though. - Yeah. He almost got over it.

167
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:36,300
Uh, that's the basement. We had to seal it up. There's some black mold down there.

168
00:17:36,303 --> 00:17:40,760
My mother loved her kitchen, so we keep a piece of her in here.

169
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:44,785
Georgina, this is Chris. This is Rose's boyfriend.

170
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:47,785
Hi. - Hello.

171
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:53,759
The garbage goes under the sinks. And now for the ...

172
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:56,627
piece de resistance.

173
00:18:01,357 --> 00:18:02,945
The field of play

174
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:08,861
I love it. The nearest house is across the lake.

175
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:11,546
Total privacy.

176
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,963
I know what you're thinking. - What?

177
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:23,628
Come on, I get it.

178
00:18:24,422 --> 00:18:29,386
White family, black servants. It's a total cliché.

179
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:32,211
I wasn't going to take it there. - Well you didn't have to, believe me.

180
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:39,719
Now, we hired Georgina and Walter to help care for my parents.

181
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:44,995
When they died I just couldn't bare to let them go.

182
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,032
But boy, I hate how it looks.

183
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,216
Yeah, I know what you mean.

184
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,514
By the way, I would have voted for Obama for a third term if I could.

185
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:01,870
Best president in my lifetime. Hands down.

186
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:04,667
I agree. - Yeah.

187
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,715
So what do your parents do, Chris?

188
00:19:13,913 --> 00:19:19,339
Uh, my Dad wasn't really in the picture. My mom passed away when I was like eleven.

189
00:19:19,342 --> 00:19:22,756
Oh, I'm sorry. How did she die? - A hit and run.

190
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:24,053
That's horrible.

191
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:26,429
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. - You were young.

192
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:30,543
Actually I don't remember a lot from that time, so ...

193
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:34,265
Well that's okay, we don't have to talk about that.

194
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:40,806
You smoke you, Chris?

195
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:45,711
You Jonesing a little bit over there? - I'm quitting.

196
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:48,688
Dad, this is why I don't bring people to the house anymore.

197
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:52,756
That's okay, we're not judging. - But it's a nasty habit though.

198
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:58,765
You should have Missy take care of that for you. - How?

199
00:19:58,768 --> 00:20:03,389
Hypnosis. She developed a method and I'm telling you it works like a charm.

200
00:20:05,462 --> 00:20:08,665
Some people don't want strangers messing around in their heads, guys.

201
00:20:08,668 --> 00:20:12,329
Listen, Chris, I thought it was total bullshit.

202
00:20:12,332 --> 00:20:17,048
I smoked cigarettes for fifteen years and I loved every goddamn puff I took.

203
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:21,231
She puts me under once, the sight of a cigarette makes me want to vomit.

204
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:26,773
Okay fall back, Dean. - It's a service we provide.

205
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,905
I'm good actually, thank you.

206
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:35,383
Well, smoker or not, we're thrilled to have you up here for the get together.

207
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:38,239
Wait, holy shit that's this weekend? - Yeah.

208
00:20:38,242 --> 00:20:40,207
What get together? - Ohhhh God.

209
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:45,166
Thanks Georg. It's a ... Rose's grandfathers .. party.

210
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,692
My Dad would throw a shin dig once a year. Get all his friends together...

211
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,483
bocce ball , badminton ...

212
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:54,614
Wait, why didn't you guys tell me about this?

213
00:20:54,617 --> 00:20:58,183
Well, it's the same day every year, sweetheart. - No it's not.

214
00:20:58,186 --> 00:21:00,774
Um, actually it is. - Yes.

215
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:02,813
Is it really? - Yeah, that is completely wrong.

216
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:09,213
We just kept it up, because after they died, it felt like we'd keep them close to us.

217
00:21:09,216 --> 00:21:10,490
They are still with us.

218
00:21:10,493 --> 00:21:13,998
I just wanted a quick chill weekend. - Lots of fun.

219
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:18,209
Sorry. - Georgina?

220
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:21,003
I am so sorry. Look what I ... - That's okay.

221
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:23,913
Why don't you go lay down, just get some rest?

222
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:31,488
Yes. I think I will. - Good.

223
00:21:37,722 --> 00:21:40,639
Oh, must be very ... - What's up, fam.?

224
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,326
Hey, Jer-bear.

225
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:44,262
Hi darling. - Hey, buddy.

226
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:46,875
Nobody answers the door around here?

227
00:21:47,627 --> 00:21:49,223
Hey Rosie.

228
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,846
Why would I lie? - Love it.

229
00:21:54,456 --> 00:21:57,011
Has she told you about her toenail collection?

230
00:21:57,014 --> 00:21:58,727
What? - Oh my God.

231
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,961
She used to bite them off, suck on them and then save them in a jewelry box.

232
00:22:01,964 --> 00:22:07,453
No I didn't, I do not know what you're talking about. - That is really disgusting.

233
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:09,549
I fucking hate you. - Okay, here's a good one.

234
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:13,601
Let me set the scene, it was our junior year.

235
00:22:13,604 --> 00:22:16,670
Rose has a crush on this guy Conner Garfield. - No.

236
00:22:16,673 --> 00:22:18,963
Conner Garfield. - No. Mom.

237
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:21,252
No, Jeremy, stop.

238
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:26,349
No. These are good, these are good. We got to ... I want to hear them. - Rose, where are your manners?

239
00:22:26,352 --> 00:22:29,214
Our guest wants to hear the stories. Please. - Thank you.

240
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:33,446
So Conner is from my lacrosse team. Huge kid, like 6' 3". He's pretty dumb, right.

241
00:22:33,449 --> 00:22:36,477
So we through this party ... - You through a party.

242
00:22:37,353 --> 00:22:39,743
I think my parents were in Greece or something.

243
00:22:39,746 --> 00:22:43,344
We raided their liquor cabinet, and we were all shit-faced, like fifteen of us.

244
00:22:43,347 --> 00:22:45,857
Oh my god, tell me this isn't true, Rose.

245
00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:52,861
I filled the liquor bottles with water ... let me finish

246
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,422
Go ahead. I'm curious. - Okay so I'm upstairs ...

247
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:02,066
hooking up with the hottest girl in the class, Jan Deely.

248
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,235
Do you realize you're coming off as like the world's biggest douchebag, right now, right?

249
00:23:07,116 --> 00:23:12,581
So Conner starts banging on the bathroom door, right. So I open it ...

250
00:23:12,986 --> 00:23:18,668
and blood's gushing from his mouth and he's screaming: "Your sister bite my fucking tongue off," right.

251
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:19,691
You bit him?

252
00:23:19,694 --> 00:23:24,878
Okay, okay, to be fair, it was my first kiss and he slipped some tongue...

253
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:29,249
and I was not expecting it. It was a reflex. I'm sorry!

254
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:31,402
A reflex that I' have since gotten rid of.

255
00:23:31,405 --> 00:23:35,085
Yeah, you better be careful. - Yeah, I'm going to be very careful now.

256
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:41,703
I'm going to get dessert. And Dean, maybe clean it up just a little bit?

257
00:23:47,537 --> 00:23:53,107
So Chris, what's your sport? Football? Baseball? - Basketball, mostly ...

258
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,737
Are you an MMA fan?

259
00:23:54,805 --> 00:23:57,533
Dude. - Dude, what?

260
00:23:58,488 --> 00:23:59,494
What?

261
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:03,387
Hey, Jeremy, why don't we let someone else have the floor for a second?

262
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:07,715
You're dating my sister, right?

263
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:12,339
He's dating my sister. You had your chance.

264
00:24:12,545 --> 00:24:14,514
I can't get to know the guy?

265
00:24:18,581 --> 00:24:20,172
You mean like UFC?

266
00:24:21,553 --> 00:24:24,559
Yes. - Yeah, no too brutal for me.

267
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:29,597
Have you ever gotten into street fights as a kid?

268
00:24:29,898 --> 00:24:34,126
I did judo after school, first grade. You should have seen me.

269
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:35,435
Judo?

270
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:41,094
Because with your frame and your genetic makeup ...

271
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:44,348
if you really pushed your body ...

272
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:50,503
And I mean really train. No pussyfooting around. You'd be a fucking beast.

273
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,514
Carrotcake.

274
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:57,424
Carrotcake.

275
00:24:58,651 --> 00:25:00,173
What have I missed?

276
00:25:01,573 --> 00:25:05,120
A whole bunch of nothing. - We just talking about sports.

277
00:25:05,953 --> 00:25:07,736
Right? - Yeah.

278
00:25:08,026 --> 00:25:09,233
That sounds good.

279
00:25:09,236 --> 00:25:13,256
So the thing about jiujitsu is...

280
00:25:14,064 --> 00:25:16,284
that strength does not matter.

281
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,054
It's all about this.

282
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:23,315
It is a strategic game, like chess.

283
00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:27,736
It's all about getting two, three, four moves ahead.

284
00:25:31,451 --> 00:25:32,586
Cool.

285
00:25:37,874 --> 00:25:39,698
Stand up.

286
00:25:39,701 --> 00:25:43,358
Jeremy, no karate at the dinner table. - It is not karate, Mom.

287
00:25:43,361 --> 00:25:45,763
Yo, I've got a rule: no play fighting with drunk people.

288
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:47,906
Not going to play? I just want to...

289
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:59,184
I wasn't going to hurt him.

290
00:26:08,763 --> 00:26:12,498
He was going to put you in a fucking headlock.

291
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:17,374
What is his problem? He has never treated any of my boyfriends that way. Ever, ever, ever.

292
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:22,414
Oh my god and then my Dad, with his those "my man" stuff.

293
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:26,198
My man, my man. I don't think he's ever heard that or said it...

294
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:28,306
and now that is all he says.

295
00:26:29,195 --> 00:26:34,978
Yep. -Oh, and my mom being rude to Georgina? What the fuck was that about? That was so crazy.

296
00:26:37,628 --> 00:26:41,648
I mean how are they different than that cop?

297
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:45,615
That's the fucking bummer of it all.

298
00:26:50,585 --> 00:26:53,737
Anything, anything more you'd like to add.

299
00:26:57,258 --> 00:26:58,771
I told you so.

300
00:27:03,263 --> 00:27:07,147
I didn't want to say, I didn't want to say it, I didn't want to say it. I didn't want to say it.

301
00:27:07,318 --> 00:27:09,085
I don't like being wrong.

302
00:27:09,246 --> 00:27:11,551
I've noticed that. - I am sorry.

303
00:27:11,554 --> 00:27:16,312
No, no, no. Wait. Come here. - Sorry. This sucks.

304
00:27:16,315 --> 00:27:17,835
What? Why do you say you're sorry?

305
00:27:18,628 --> 00:27:21,871
Because I brought you here and I'm related to all of them.

306
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,793
No, it's fine.

307
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,945
Why are you so calm? - Honestly, this is nothing.

308
00:27:29,746 --> 00:27:31,890
I like you and your racial flow

309
00:27:33,392 --> 00:27:35,223
Is this a racial flow? - Racial.

310
00:27:35,226 --> 00:27:38,458
Are you feeling a racial flow. - Yes, you feel racial flowing.

311
00:27:53,061 --> 00:27:54,680
What? - The party.

312
00:27:55,061 --> 00:27:57,529
How bad can that be? - They're so white.

313
00:27:57,532 --> 00:28:00,209
Like so white. - It's all good.

314
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:09,739
You know, with my genetic makeup the shit goes down. I'm a beast.

315
00:30:59,748 --> 00:31:02,471
Do you realize how dangerous smoking is?

316
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,898
Yeah.

317
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:11,593
Come in and sit with me, please.

318
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:15,236
Just for a moment, please.

319
00:31:15,897 --> 00:31:16,934
Thank you.

320
00:31:23,545 --> 00:31:27,047
So you're comfortable enough, right? - It's perfect. Thanks.

321
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,150
Sure.

322
00:31:36,055 --> 00:31:37,851
Want to know how it works?

323
00:31:44,343 --> 00:31:47,891
You dangle a pocket watch in front of people's faces? Is that it?

324
00:31:48,998 --> 00:31:53,112
You watch a lot of TV. - When I was a kid.

325
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:56,545
Now you're feeling very sleepy.

326
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,790
We do use focal points sometimes to...

327
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:04,799
guide someone into a state of heightened suggestibility.

328
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:08,538
Heightened suggestibility? - That's right, that's right.

329
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:15,865
Do you smoke in front of my daughter?

330
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,943
I'm going to quit, I promise. - That's my kid, that is my kid.

331
00:32:21,946 --> 00:32:23,017
Are you interested?

332
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:29,762
What about your mother?

333
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,776
What about her?

334
00:32:35,064 --> 00:32:37,451
Wait, are we ... - Where were you when she died?

335
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,994
I don't to think about that.

336
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:58,459
Home ... watching TV.

337
00:32:58,462 --> 00:33:00,182
can you hear the TV?

338
00:33:00,464 --> 00:33:01,579
What do you hear?

339
00:33:02,352 --> 00:33:05,044
Rain. - Rain. It was raining.

340
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:09,525
Can you hear the rain?

341
00:33:16,064 --> 00:33:18,155
Do you hear it? Find it.

342
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:22,241
Tell me when you've found it.

343
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:35,818
Come here, Chris, look at me.

344
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:42,382
I found it. - Where was your mom?

345
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:50,306
She uh...

346
00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:55,336
She was coming home. She wasn't home.

347
00:33:56,538 --> 00:33:57,611
From her work?

348
00:34:04,785 --> 00:34:06,315
And what did you do?

349
00:34:11,922 --> 00:34:13,048
Nothing.

350
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:15,536
Nothing?

351
00:34:17,234 --> 00:34:18,766
I just sat there.

352
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:21,642
You Didn't call anyone? - No.

353
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:22,683
Why not?

354
00:34:26,055 --> 00:34:28,189
I don't know, I just...

355
00:34:29,578 --> 00:34:32,929
thought that if I did, it would make it real.

356
00:34:42,117 --> 00:34:43,529
You're so scared.

357
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:47,000
Do you think it was your fault?

358
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:53,730
How do you feel now?

359
00:34:56,002 --> 00:34:57,309
I can't move.

360
00:34:59,412 --> 00:35:02,203
You can't move. - Why can't I move?

361
00:35:02,993 --> 00:35:04,395
You're paralyzed.

362
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:08,496
Just Like that day when you did nothing. You did nothing.

363
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:14,365
Now...

364
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:17,614
sink into the floor.

365
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:19,350
Wait, wait, wait. - Sink.

366
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:36,390
Now you're in the Sunken place.

367
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,428
What's up man?

368
00:38:48,441 --> 00:38:50,229
They working you good out here, huh?

369
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:01,284
Nothing I don't want to be doing.

370
00:39:07,454 --> 00:39:11,860
I didn't get to meet you yet, up close. I'm Chris.

371
00:39:11,863 --> 00:39:13,545
I know who you are.

372
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,746
She is lovely isn't she?

373
00:39:18,212 --> 00:39:19,302
Rose?

374
00:39:21,263 --> 00:39:25,833
Yes, she is. - One of a kind. Top of the line.

375
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:29,567
A real doggone keeper.

376
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:33,650
Right.

377
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:39,410
I'm sorry about last night. - What?

378
00:39:40,015 --> 00:39:43,437
My exercise. I did not mean to scare you.

379
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:50,429
And did it work? - Did What work?

380
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:54,078
You were in Mrs Armitage's office for quite some time.

381
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:04,329
I guess I had too much of that wine last night. I can't really remember...

382
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,825
Well, I should get back to work and mind my own business.

383
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:33,987
I think your mom hypnotized me last night.

384
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:38,451
What? When?

385
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:43,040
I went out for, I went out for some air last night and I run into her...

386
00:40:44,405 --> 00:40:48,777
and I can barely remember any of it but now the thought of a cigarette makes me want to throw up.

387
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:51,926
Oh my God.

388
00:40:53,437 --> 00:40:56,757
I'm Sorry. I can't believe she did that to you.

389
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,087
And I had some fucked up dreams. - What did you dream?

390
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:04,285
I was in a hole or something and I could not move. It was like ...

391
00:41:04,288 --> 00:41:07,723
God, That sounds terrible. I'm Sorry.

392
00:41:10,523 --> 00:41:12,327
What's Walter's deal?

393
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,455
What do you mean his deal?

394
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:18,572
I just talked to the dude and his whole vibe is hostile. - Did he say something?

395
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:23,655
It's not what he says it's how he says it.

396
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,671
Maybe he likes you.

397
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:34,637
Maybe he's jealous or something. I...

398
00:41:35,547 --> 00:41:38,001
Are you fucking with me? - No.

399
00:41:40,473 --> 00:41:43,155
So you think I've got a chance?

400
00:41:43,552 --> 00:41:46,559
Okay, you find that funny. - Do you have a good word?

401
00:41:46,562 --> 00:41:50,420
Great, no, fine. - I will, I'm going to talk with my Dad about that. That is not...

402
00:41:50,423 --> 00:41:52,589
No, don't talk to your Dad. It's fine. - No, that's not it.

403
00:41:52,592 --> 00:41:57,091
It's fine, it's not a big deal. Forget about it. It's done.

404
00:42:00,235 --> 00:42:01,346
Oh boy.

405
00:42:08,863 --> 00:42:10,676
Oh man.

406
00:42:11,273 --> 00:42:14,086
It begins. Are you ready for it?

407
00:42:14,501 --> 00:42:16,999
Yeah, yeah. - Not me.

408
00:42:17,808 --> 00:42:20,899
There they are. Marcia.

409
00:42:21,184 --> 00:42:22,611
So nice.

410
00:42:24,604 --> 00:42:27,523
Just laugh. - Laugh? Okay. How do you do that again?

411
00:42:27,607 --> 00:42:31,548
Just smile all the time. Yeah, there you go. There it is.

412
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,715
oh Look, it's the Greene's.

413
00:42:35,718 --> 00:42:39,093
Gordon and Emily, this is Chris. Chris, this is Gordon and Emily Greene.

414
00:42:39,096 --> 00:42:41,184
Nice to meet you, Chris.

415
00:42:41,187 --> 00:42:42,871
Nice to meet you indeed. - Also.

416
00:42:42,874 --> 00:42:44,998
Boy That's quite a grip. - Thank you. You too.

417
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:46,748
Do you ever play golf?

418
00:42:46,751 --> 00:42:49,528
Once, a few years ago. I wasn't very good.

419
00:42:49,937 --> 00:42:53,940
Gordon was a professional golfer for years. - Are you kidding?

420
00:42:53,943 --> 00:43:00,147
Well I can't quite swing the hips like I used to though. But I do know Tiger.

421
00:43:01,142 --> 00:43:03,233
Isn't That's great. - Super.

422
00:43:03,236 --> 00:43:08,353
Gordon loves Tiger. - The best I've ever seen, ever hands down.

423
00:43:08,356 --> 00:43:11,322
So Chris. Let's see your form.

424
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:15,327
This is Nelson and Alisa. - How are you doing?

425
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:19,353
Oh, How handsome is he?

426
00:43:19,356 --> 00:43:21,001
Are you handsome?

427
00:43:25,961 --> 00:43:29,096
Not bad, huh Nelson?

428
00:43:31,604 --> 00:43:33,839
So, Is it true?

429
00:43:36,223 --> 00:43:37,673
Is it better?

430
00:43:39,956 --> 00:43:44,547
Fair skin has been in favor for the past what, couple of hundreds of years...

431
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:49,392
But now the pendulum has swung back. Black is in fashion.

432
00:43:53,105 --> 00:43:56,808
Pardon me. I'm going to take some pictures. - Of course.

433
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,051
There he is.

434
00:45:00,891 --> 00:45:02,890
Good to see another brother around here.

435
00:45:06,022 --> 00:45:10,150
Hi. Yes of course it is.

436
00:45:12,493 --> 00:45:13,684
Is something wrong?

437
00:45:14,874 --> 00:45:19,359
There you are. Can you do something with this.

438
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,620
Hey. I'm Philomena. And you are?

439
00:45:25,524 --> 00:45:27,629
Chris. Rose's boyfriend.

440
00:45:27,632 --> 00:45:31,844
Fantastic. You two make a lovely couple.

441
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:37,664
Thanks. - Where are my manners? Logan. Logan King.

442
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:42,568
Chris just told me that he felt much more comfortable with my being here.

443
00:45:43,338 --> 00:45:44,969
That's nice.

444
00:45:45,858 --> 00:45:52,358
Logan, I hate to tear you away dear, but the Wincott's were asking about you.

445
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:57,196
Well, it was nice to meet you, Chris.

446
00:46:02,352 --> 00:46:03,573
Goodbye.

447
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,986
What the fuck?

448
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:41,234
Ignorance.

449
00:46:43,102 --> 00:46:45,219
Who? - All of them.

450
00:46:45,294 --> 00:46:49,496
They mean well, but they have no idea what real people go through.

451
00:46:51,861 --> 00:46:54,048
Jim Hudson. - Chris.

452
00:46:54,051 --> 00:46:55,631
I know who you are.

453
00:46:56,087 --> 00:46:59,977
I am an admirer of your work. You have a great eye.

454
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:04,376
Wait. Jim Hudson? Hudson Galleries?

455
00:47:04,654 --> 00:47:09,148
Believe me, the irony of being a blind art dealer, isn't lost on me.

456
00:47:09,887 --> 00:47:11,125
How'd you do it?

457
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:16,830
My assistants describes the work to me in great detail.

458
00:47:17,722 --> 00:47:19,180
You've got something.

459
00:47:19,183 --> 00:47:23,598
The images you capture are so brutal, so melancholic.

460
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,069
Powerful stuff. I think.

461
00:47:27,568 --> 00:47:28,584
Thank you.

462
00:47:29,451 --> 00:47:33,640
I used to dabble myself. Wilderness mostly.

463
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:39,481
I have submitted to "Nat Geo" 14 times before I realizing I didn't have the eye.

464
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:43,423
I began dealing and then of course my vision went to shit.

465
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:49,099
I know. Life can be a sick joke.

466
00:47:49,484 --> 00:47:54,797
One day you're developing prints in the dark room, the next day you wake up in the dark.

467
00:47:55,702 --> 00:47:57,225
Genetic disease.

468
00:47:57,686 --> 00:48:02,027
Shit ain't fair, man. - Oh you've got that right, shit ain't fair.

469
00:49:01,604 --> 00:49:03,100
Come here.

470
00:49:04,485 --> 00:49:08,153
What the fuck? You left me out there. - Look at this.

471
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:13,689
She unplugged my phone. - Who?

472
00:49:13,692 --> 00:49:16,653
Georgina. I came here to talk to Rod and now I got no juice.

473
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:22,051
So you think she did that because...? - Maybe she doesn't like ...

474
00:49:24,048 --> 00:49:25,552
the fact that I'm with you

475
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:30,339
Really?

476
00:49:31,327 --> 00:49:32,415
It's a thing.

477
00:49:32,418 --> 00:49:36,883
So, you are so sexy that people are just unplugging your phone?

478
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,824
Forget it. Never mind. - No, no stop. Don't ...

479
00:49:43,428 --> 00:49:47,000
Don't do that. Don't ... - It's okay, it's okay. I'm sorry. It's all good, right?

480
00:50:01,218 --> 00:50:03,307
ah, they got you on display now, huh?

481
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:05,759
It's weird, man. And the people here too.

482
00:50:05,762 --> 00:50:08,278
It's Like they haven't met a black person that doesn't work for them.

483
00:50:08,281 --> 00:50:09,711
yep you're in it

484
00:50:09,955 --> 00:50:14,215
All full of shit, I didn't even want to tell you. - What?

485
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:19,909
I got hypnotized last night. - Man get the fuck out of here.

486
00:50:19,912 --> 00:50:24,690
No. Yo, yo, yeah it's to quit smoking. But Rose's mom's a psychiatrist, so ...

487
00:50:24,693 --> 00:50:27,535
Bro I don't care if the bitch is Iyanla Vanzant, okay?

488
00:50:27,538 --> 00:50:30,205
She can't fix my motherfucking life. You ain't getting in my head.

489
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:34,572
I know. She caught me off guard right, but it's cool because ...

490
00:50:35,675 --> 00:50:39,846
I'm cured. It worked. - Bro, Why are not you scared of this, man?

491
00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:44,654
They could of had you doing all types of stupid shit. They could of had you barking like a dog...

492
00:50:44,657 --> 00:50:48,418
flying around like you're a fucking pigeon, looking ridiculous, okay. Or...

493
00:50:48,807 --> 00:50:52,357
I don't know if you know this. White people love making people sex slaves and shit.

494
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,941
Yeah I'm pretty sure they are not a kinky sex family, dog

495
00:50:55,944 --> 00:51:01,406
Look, Jeffrey Dahmer was eating the shit our of niggers heads. Okay? But that was after he fucked the heads.

496
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:05,332
Do you think they saw that shit coming? Hell no, okay?

497
00:51:05,335 --> 00:51:09,633
They were coming over there like "I'm a suck a little dick, maybe jiggle some balls or shit

498
00:51:09,636 --> 00:51:13,319
No. They didn't get a chance to jiggle shit because their heads was off their bodies.

499
00:51:13,322 --> 00:51:17,494
Yeah they still sucked the dick, but without their heads. It was weird detached heads shit.

500
00:51:17,497 --> 00:51:18,901
That was Jeffrey Dahmer.

501
00:51:20,084 --> 00:51:21,954
Thanks for that image.

502
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:25,024
Hey man, I'm not making this shit up. I saw it on A & E. That is real life.

503
00:51:25,027 --> 00:51:28,221
Yo, and the black people out here too. It seems like they all missed the movement.

504
00:51:28,224 --> 00:51:30,244
It's because they probably hypnotized.

505
00:51:32,724 --> 00:51:37,621
Look bro, all I'm doing is just connecting the dots. I taking what you presented to me, okay?

506
00:51:37,624 --> 00:51:42,557
I'm a tell you this. I think that mom is putting everybody in a trance and she's fucking the shit out of them.

507
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:43,851
Thanks, Rod. Bye.

508
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:47,128
Hello. Fuck, hi.

509
00:51:50,604 --> 00:51:53,418
I owe you an apology.

510
00:51:53,716 --> 00:51:56,872
How rude of me to have touched your belongings without asking.

511
00:51:58,656 --> 00:52:01,468
Ah, No, it's cool. I was just confused.

512
00:52:01,471 --> 00:52:06,228
Well, I can assure you there was no funny business.

513
00:52:06,538 --> 00:52:08,436
Allow me to explain.

514
00:52:08,896 --> 00:52:13,002
I lifted your cellular phone to wipe down the dresser...

515
00:52:13,484 --> 00:52:16,308
and it accidentally came undone.

516
00:52:16,311 --> 00:52:20,423
And rather than meddle with it further, I left it that way.

517
00:52:21,553 --> 00:52:23,071
How foolish of me.

518
00:52:24,944 --> 00:52:28,561
It's fine. I wan't trying to snitch.

519
00:52:30,085 --> 00:52:33,312
Snitch? - Rat you out.

520
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:36,692
Tattle tale.

521
00:52:40,508 --> 00:52:42,723
Oh, Don't you worry about that.

522
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,466
I can assure you...

523
00:52:46,645 --> 00:52:48,657
I don't answer to anyone.

524
00:52:49,888 --> 00:52:50,975
Right.

525
00:52:51,678 --> 00:52:57,411
All I know is sometimes, if there's too many white people I get nervous, you know?

526
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,576
Aren't you something.

527
00:53:37,658 --> 00:53:41,115
That's not my experience. Not at all.

528
00:53:43,504 --> 00:53:47,461
The Armitages are so good to us.

529
00:53:49,342 --> 00:53:51,366
They treat us like family.

530
00:54:07,404 --> 00:54:09,024
This bitch is crazy.

531
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,104
This bitch is crazy.

532
00:54:19,169 --> 00:54:23,252
Hey, hang on. Chris, I want you to introduce you to some friends.

533
00:54:23,255 --> 00:54:27,420
This is David and Marcia Wincott, Ronald and Celia Jeffries ...

534
00:54:27,423 --> 00:54:30,839
Hiroki Tanaka and Jessika and Fredrich Walden.

535
00:54:33,705 --> 00:54:35,635
Too many names to remember, but hi.

536
00:54:36,929 --> 00:54:40,076
Do you find that being African-American ...

537
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:45,779
more advantage or disadvantage in the modern world?

538
00:54:48,584 --> 00:54:49,989
A tough one.

539
00:54:52,891 --> 00:54:55,318
Yeah, I don't know, man.

540
00:55:00,157 --> 00:55:03,585
They were asking me about the African American experience. Maybe you can take this one.

541
00:55:08,001 --> 00:55:13,719
I find that the African-American experience for me has been for the most part very good.

542
00:55:13,722 --> 00:55:17,048
Although I find it idifficult to go into detail ...

543
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:20,651
because I haven't had much desire to leave the house in a while.

544
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,855
We have become home bodies. Yeah.

545
00:55:24,385 --> 00:55:28,494
Yes, but even when we go into the city, I just have no interest.

546
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:31,364
The chores have become my sanctuary.

547
00:55:47,371 --> 00:55:48,582
Get out.

548
00:55:50,086 --> 00:55:51,304
Sorry, man.

549
00:55:51,701 --> 00:55:53,119
Get out!

550
00:55:54,437 --> 00:55:56,062
Yo chill...

551
00:55:56,065 --> 00:55:58,946
Chill!

552
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:11,778
Seizures create anxiety, which can trigger aggression.

553
00:56:11,781 --> 00:56:15,599
Yeah, but like randomly attacking other people? - It's not random.

554
00:56:15,602 --> 00:56:19,355
Yeah, It was your flash. That's what set him off.

555
00:56:21,533 --> 00:56:24,134
How is he doing? - Much better.

556
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,594
I imagine that I...

557
00:56:29,434 --> 00:56:31,249
owe you all an apology.

558
00:56:31,252 --> 00:56:35,175
No, no, no we're just very happy that you're yourself again.

559
00:56:35,178 --> 00:56:37,017
Yes, yes I am.

560
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,019
And I thank God for you for calming me down.

561
00:56:41,794 --> 00:56:46,888
I know that I must have frightened you all quite a bit. Especially you, Chris.

562
00:56:48,407 --> 00:56:49,503
I'm sorry.

563
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:51,663
The flash, I didn't know.

564
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,553
Of course not. How could you have?

565
00:56:54,556 --> 00:56:56,957
But you shouldn't have been drinking either.

566
00:56:58,226 --> 00:57:04,034
Well, I will have to let you all get on the rest of this night without my marvelous wit.

567
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:07,940
The whole ordeal has made me quite a bit exhausted.

568
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:10,580
Why don't you just get some rest?

569
00:57:13,578 --> 00:57:15,855
It was nice meeting you, Chris.

570
00:57:19,597 --> 00:57:21,960
Something to lighten the mood?

571
00:57:21,963 --> 00:57:25,396
Yes. Yeah, Let's get this party back on track.

572
00:57:25,399 --> 00:57:28,318
How about sparklers and bingo?

573
00:57:31,104 --> 00:57:34,251
We're going go on a walk. - Are you sure?

574
00:57:37,527 --> 00:57:38,777
Shall we?

575
00:57:40,106 --> 00:57:43,334
My cousin's epileptic. That wasn't a seizure.

576
00:57:44,854 --> 00:57:47,867
My Dad is a neurosurgeon and that is what he said it was.

577
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:49,682
I am inclined to trust ... - That was not a seizure.

578
00:57:49,685 --> 00:57:50,685
What was it then?

579
00:57:51,123 --> 00:57:52,752
How long have you known that guy?

580
00:57:53,423 --> 00:57:55,864
I met him today. Why?

581
00:57:59,161 --> 00:58:01,169
This is going to sound weird, but ...

582
00:58:02,772 --> 00:58:04,409
when he came at me ...

583
00:58:05,888 --> 00:58:07,409
I felt like I knew him.

584
00:58:10,034 --> 00:58:13,988
Like you've met Logan before? - No, not Logan, I knew the guy who came at me.

585
00:58:23,931 --> 00:58:26,359
I think your mom got in my head, alright.

586
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,207
I think she got in my head...

587
00:58:28,268 --> 00:58:31,359
Yeah, and it worked I thought. - No, it did not.

588
00:58:33,193 --> 00:58:37,495
She got in my head and now I'm thinking all this fucked up shit that I don't want to think about.

589
00:58:39,237 --> 00:58:40,415
Like what?

590
00:58:54,202 --> 00:58:55,730
I just need to go.

591
00:59:03,592 --> 00:59:04,909
You want to go. Hmm, mmm

592
00:59:07,386 --> 00:59:08,763
Without me?

593
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,088
Whatever you want.

594
01:00:24,044 --> 01:00:26,403
I told you about that night when my mom died.

595
01:00:27,104 --> 01:00:30,122
When I didn't call 911 and didn't go out looking for her.

596
01:00:33,556 --> 01:00:37,943
One hour went by, then two ... then three ...

597
01:00:39,618 --> 01:00:41,392
and I just sat there.

598
01:00:43,757 --> 01:00:45,552
I was just watching TV.

599
01:00:47,236 --> 01:00:50,579
There was nothing you could have done. - I later found out that ...

600
01:00:52,362 --> 01:00:54,911
She had survived the initial hit.

601
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:04,993
She lay there bleeding by the side of the road, cold and alone.

602
01:01:08,217 --> 01:01:11,325
That's how died in the early morning, cold and alone.

603
01:01:13,517 --> 01:01:15,247
And I was watching TV.

604
01:01:18,116 --> 01:01:22,101
There was time. You were just a little kid. - There was time.

605
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:23,874
There was time.

606
01:01:25,497 --> 01:01:30,568
There was a time when somebody was looking for her. There was time, nobody, nobody, nobody was looking.

607
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:45,851
You're all I've got. I'm not going to leave here without you. I'm not going to abandon you.

608
01:01:47,835 --> 01:01:52,204
You're not? - No, no I'm not.

609
01:02:02,224 --> 01:02:06,187
Oh my God, you scared me.

610
01:02:10,303 --> 01:02:11,711
Let's go home.

611
01:02:13,295 --> 01:02:14,334
What?

612
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:17,660
Let's go home, this sucks.

613
01:02:19,354 --> 01:02:22,257
This sucks. Let's go home. I'll make something up.

614
01:02:24,644 --> 01:02:26,048
I love you.

615
01:02:27,646 --> 01:02:29,054
Love you too baby.

616
01:02:46,831 --> 01:02:49,223
Bye. - Come on, baby.

617
01:02:51,052 --> 01:02:53,729
Good night, Chris. It was great to meet you.

618
01:03:59,195 --> 01:04:00,493
Asshole.

619
01:04:05,302 --> 01:04:07,933
That's Dre. - Dre ?

620
01:04:07,936 --> 01:04:09,566
Andre Hayworth.

621
01:04:09,569 --> 01:04:11,866
Used to kick it with Veronica? - Veronica from wh...?

622
01:04:11,869 --> 01:04:14,665
Teresa's sister who worked at the movie theater on 8th.

623
01:04:14,668 --> 01:04:18,776
Yeah, that is him. But wait, wait, wait...

624
01:04:18,779 --> 01:04:21,177
This is so fucking, fucking crazy...

625
01:04:22,364 --> 01:04:24,816
He's different. - No shit!

626
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,810
Why is he dressed like that? - It's not that. It's everything.

627
01:04:27,813 --> 01:04:30,771
He came to the party with a white woman like 30 years older than him.

628
01:04:30,774 --> 01:04:31,919
Sex Slave.

629
01:04:34,276 --> 01:04:39,361
Chris, you've got to get the fuck up out of there, man. You are in some " Eyes Wide Shut " situation. Leave the motherfuck...

630
01:04:40,054 --> 01:04:41,765
you gonna be a... Hello?

631
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:45,917
Chris? His battery must have fucking died.

632
01:04:47,421 --> 01:04:51,479
Hey handsome. Are you packing? - Rose, we've got to go, we got to go now.

633
01:04:53,915 --> 01:04:55,106
Is everything okay?

634
01:04:55,109 --> 01:04:58,378
I tell you in the car but we have to go right now. Okay?

635
01:04:58,381 --> 01:05:01,436
Okay. Yeah. Let me go get my bag.

636
01:06:41,311 --> 01:06:46,078
Are you ready? - Yeah, I was just looking for my camera.

637
01:06:49,402 --> 01:06:50,818
It's right here.

638
01:06:50,821 --> 01:06:54,141
Have you got the keys? I'm gonna put the bags in the trunk real quick.

639
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:58,819
Yeah, They' are in here somewhere. It's just a matter of finding them.

640
01:06:59,538 --> 01:07:00,662
Are you OK?

641
01:07:04,379 --> 01:07:06,067
Take me second.

642
01:07:09,262 --> 01:07:10,766
What you can't find those keys?

643
01:07:10,769 --> 01:07:13,677
No. I can never find them. - Let's do this on the move.

644
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:22,716
Chris ... - Let's get the keys.

645
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:27,969
Yo man. -Where are you going? The party is just starting. - I just put the bags in the car, man.

646
01:07:28,362 --> 01:07:31,874
Would anyone like tea? - No I'm good. We leaving, actually.

647
01:07:31,877 --> 01:07:34,257
Really? Why? Is there something wrong?

648
01:07:35,063 --> 01:07:39,669
His dog got really sick, so he has to be at the vet first thing in the morning.

649
01:07:39,672 --> 01:07:42,793
Sorry. - How terrible.

650
01:07:43,545 --> 01:07:46,174
Rose, the keys. - I'm looking.

651
01:08:01,162 --> 01:08:03,798
What is your purpose, Chris?

652
01:08:05,072 --> 01:08:06,092
What?

653
01:08:08,441 --> 01:08:11,276
In life. What is your purpose?

654
01:08:12,452 --> 01:08:16,199
Right now it's finding those keys.

655
01:08:17,691 --> 01:08:19,000
Fire.

656
01:08:20,186 --> 01:08:22,642
It is a reflection of our own mortality.

657
01:08:22,645 --> 01:08:26,133
We are born, we breathe and then we die.

658
01:08:28,419 --> 01:08:29,798
I'm looking.

659
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,398
Even the sun will die someday.

660
01:08:34,496 --> 01:08:36,120
But we are divine.

661
01:08:37,477 --> 01:08:40,999
We are the gods trapped in cocoons.

662
01:08:43,576 --> 01:08:45,477
I don't know where they are.

663
01:08:47,684 --> 01:08:51,099
Rose, give me those keys.

664
01:08:51,391 --> 01:08:54,487
Give me those keys! Rose, now, now! The keys!

665
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:58,886
Whoa be careful bro. - What the fuck?

666
01:08:59,358 --> 01:09:03,157
I didn't do anything. - What the fuck is going on?

667
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,953
Where are those keys, Rose?

668
01:09:17,037 --> 01:09:19,131
You know I can't give you the keys right babe?

669
01:09:36,649 --> 01:09:37,856
Come on.

670
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,810
Is he hurt? - Did you see him drop?

671
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:56,396
Yes I did. Jeremy, grab his legs, please. Take him downstairs. Dean, help him.

672
01:09:56,399 --> 01:09:57,841
I can get him alone.

673
01:09:57,844 --> 01:10:01,399
No, you can't, you've already damaged him enough. - Okay, fuck.

674
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:07,848
Are you ready? - Mind his head.

675
01:10:17,444 --> 01:10:18,620
Careful.

676
01:10:18,799 --> 01:10:21,132
You'll drop him. - No, I'm not.

677
01:10:21,496 --> 01:10:22,913
You're not get me looking...

678
01:10:23,309 --> 01:10:25,105
Can I help? - Okay, that was my fault.

679
01:10:29,004 --> 01:10:31,318
You were one of my favorites.

680
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,715
You hear that, Chris?

681
01:10:34,985 --> 01:10:36,944
One of her favorites.

682
01:11:01,699 --> 01:11:05,843
Hey, it's Chris, I'm either away from the phone or I just don't want to talk to you. Peace.

683
01:11:25,009 --> 01:11:29,156
Hey, it's Chris, I'm either away from my phone or I just don't want to talk to you. Peace.

684
01:11:33,962 --> 01:11:37,084
Yeah. Me too.

685
01:11:38,305 --> 01:11:41,199
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.

686
01:11:41,202 --> 01:11:44,879
Millions of Americans feel the effects of aging.

687
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:47,589
Every movement puts pressure on your joints.

688
01:11:47,592 --> 01:11:50,722
Over time, this wear can cause discomfort.

689
01:12:12,639 --> 01:12:15,796
What happened to Andre Hayworth? He disappeared in Evergreen Hallow

690
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:46,875
Is there anything more beautiful than a sunrise?

691
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:57,093
I am Roman Armitage and if you're watching this, you're probably wondering what's going on.

692
01:13:57,491 --> 01:14:01,107
There's no need to worry. Let's take a walk.

693
01:14:04,432 --> 01:14:10,740
You have been chosen because of the physical advantages you enjoyed your entire lifetime.

694
01:14:10,743 --> 01:14:16,945
With your natural gifts and our determination we could both be part of something greater.

695
01:14:17,076 --> 01:14:19,209
Something perfect.

696
01:14:22,253 --> 01:14:28,158
The Coagula procedure is a man-made miracle.

697
01:14:29,069 --> 01:14:33,111
Our order has been developing it for many, many years ...

698
01:14:33,211 --> 01:14:36,514
and it wasn't until recently it was perfected ...

699
01:14:37,447 --> 01:14:41,454
by my own flesh and blood.

700
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:49,022
My family and I are honored to offer it as a service to members of our group.

701
01:14:49,025 --> 01:14:54,206
Don't waste your strength. Don't try to fight it. You can't stop the inevitable.

702
01:14:54,378 --> 01:14:55,777
And who knows?

703
01:14:56,653 --> 01:15:02,924
Maybe one day you will enjoy being members of the family.

704
01:15:05,824 --> 01:15:07,035
Behold ...

705
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,942
a coagula.

706
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,170
Fuck.

707
01:15:40,446 --> 01:15:45,006
Hello, mister...? - Williams. Rod Williams.

708
01:15:45,009 --> 01:15:47,565
TSA? - Yes Ma'am.

709
01:15:48,256 --> 01:15:52,592
Well, You know all TSA issues should be brought up with the authorizing officer.

710
01:15:52,595 --> 01:15:54,844
Yes, ma'am, but this is not a TSA business.

711
01:15:54,847 --> 01:15:58,435
Don't the hell call me "ma'am." Because we not going to get along.

712
01:15:59,591 --> 01:16:03,894
How can I help you, Rod Williams from the TSA? Alright, here it is.

713
01:16:06,432 --> 01:16:09,037
My boy Chris has been missing for two days.

714
01:16:09,327 --> 01:16:14,612
Your son is missing? - No. Not my son. My friend. He 26.

715
01:16:14,615 --> 01:16:16,808
His name is Chris, Chris Washington.

716
01:16:20,004 --> 01:16:23,610
He left on Friday with his girlfriend, Rose Armitage.

717
01:16:25,365 --> 01:16:26,573
She is white.

718
01:16:29,164 --> 01:16:32,634
Alright, go on. - Look, Chris was supposed to come back on Sunday, right?

719
01:16:32,637 --> 01:16:34,749
And I been watching his dog, Sid.

720
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,386
That's Sid. - Cute, right?

721
01:16:38,767 --> 01:16:42,503
So Chris sent this to me from his girlfriend's parent's house .

722
01:16:43,106 --> 01:16:44,836
You see? That's Andre Hayworth.

723
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:47,223
Okay? Someone we knew back in the day.

724
01:16:47,226 --> 01:16:50,859
Apparently he has been missing for six months in some affluent suburb.

725
01:16:51,433 --> 01:16:55,548
He don't look so missing to me. - That's because we found him. Right?

726
01:16:55,551 --> 01:16:57,775
But Chris says he's acting real different.

727
01:16:57,890 --> 01:17:02,485
Different How? This dude is from Brooklyn. Huh, He don't dress like this.

728
01:17:02,488 --> 01:17:04,640
I didn't used to dress like this.

729
01:17:04,643 --> 01:17:07,274
Plus he is married to a white woman twice his age.

730
01:17:07,406 --> 01:17:09,658
And that would explain the clothes. Alright.

731
01:17:12,482 --> 01:17:14,150
Rod Williams, TSA.

732
01:17:14,153 --> 01:17:17,245
I know, I know, I know, but I'm trying to work towards this.

733
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:21,613
Look, What I'm about to tell you going to sound crazy. You ready?

734
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,564
Try me. - I believe they've been abducting black people ...

735
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:31,475
brainwashing them, making them work for them as sex slaves and shit.

736
01:17:31,478 --> 01:17:34,728
Sorry about the shit. Sorry.

737
01:17:41,727 --> 01:17:42,764
Hold on a second.

738
01:17:42,767 --> 01:17:46,081
Then he sent some me some weird picture, and I like, 'Oh man, that's Andre Hayworth. "

739
01:17:46,084 --> 01:17:47,737
This dude been missing for six months, right?

740
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:52,432
So I do all my research you know because as a TSA agent, you know you guys are detectives, I've got the same training.

741
01:17:52,435 --> 01:17:56,147
We might know more than you all sometimes because we dealing with some terrorist shit, so ...

742
01:17:56,150 --> 01:18:00,300
But that's a totally different story. So I go do my detective work, right?

743
01:18:00,303 --> 01:18:03,656
and I start putting pieces together and see this is what I came up with.

744
01:18:03,664 --> 01:18:08,803
They're probably abducting black people, brainwashing them and making them slaves...

745
01:18:08,806 --> 01:18:12,101
or sex slaves, not just regular slaves, but sex slaves and shit.

746
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:17,265
See I don't know if it's the hypnosis that's making them slaves or whatnot...

747
01:18:17,766 --> 01:18:23,531
but all I know is they already got two brothers we know and they could be a whole bunch of brothers they got already.

748
01:18:24,455 --> 01:18:25,755
What's the next move?

749
01:18:36,604 --> 01:18:40,344
And don't ever, ever say that I don't do nothing for you.

750
01:18:44,528 --> 01:18:47,846
Oh White girls, oh they get you every time.

751
01:18:54,005 --> 01:18:55,877
Magic ain't real.

752
01:18:57,037 --> 01:18:59,031
None of this shit makes sense.

753
01:19:12,648 --> 01:19:13,902
Hello?

754
01:19:17,244 --> 01:19:22,514
Hey, Rose? It's me, Rod. - Hi.

755
01:19:23,987 --> 01:19:25,345
Where is Chris?

756
01:19:26,397 --> 01:19:30,073
He left two days ago. - He left?

757
01:19:30,358 --> 01:19:34,344
Yeah. He got all paranoid and then he freaked out on me.

758
01:19:34,744 --> 01:19:38,113
And then he just got in a cab and left his phone.

759
01:19:38,897 --> 01:19:43,022
Wait. You haven't seen him? - No, he never came back here.

760
01:19:46,885 --> 01:19:51,145
I've been calling his phone a bunch of times. Matter of fact, I even went to the police.

761
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,030
What did you say? - I just said he was missing.

762
01:19:55,141 --> 01:19:57,681
Oh Good. You ...

763
01:19:58,854 --> 01:20:00,209
Let me ask you something.

764
01:20:01,371 --> 01:20:05,227
What cab company did he use to leave?

765
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:06,886
Oh gosh, I...

766
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:13,898
I don't know. I guess maybe a local one or I guess he could have called an Uber.

767
01:20:14,557 --> 01:20:17,378
Wait, I am so confused.

768
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:21,878
oh sh...You confused? oh sh...okay confused, you something know, me too.

769
01:20:21,881 --> 01:20:25,522
Could you hold on one second? Hold on.

770
01:20:27,558 --> 01:20:31,344
You lying bitch. She is lying like a motherfucker. I know that...

771
01:20:31,347 --> 01:20:35,193
Whew that TSA shit tingles. This motherfucker is lying.

772
01:20:36,467 --> 01:20:38,980
Okay, I got you. I'm going to record your ass.

773
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:43,440
I'm going to record the shit out of you. You talk too goddamn much. You're gonna say something.

774
01:20:44,615 --> 01:20:45,837
Record.

775
01:20:46,611 --> 01:20:47,939
Speaker.

776
01:20:48,491 --> 01:20:49,713
Unmute.

777
01:20:54,732 --> 01:20:58,456
So last time I talked to Chris, he told me your mama hypnotized him.

778
01:20:59,674 --> 01:21:01,271
Rod, just stop.

779
01:21:06,243 --> 01:21:09,562
I know why you're calling. - Why is that?

780
01:21:10,921 --> 01:21:12,987
It's kind of obvious, don't you think?

781
01:21:13,857 --> 01:21:14,900
What?

782
01:21:16,059 --> 01:21:18,155
That there is something between us.

783
01:21:18,459 --> 01:21:21,058
No, what you talking about girl? I called you about Chris.

784
01:21:21,066 --> 01:21:24,742
No, Rod, whenever we'd go out, I remember you looking at me.

785
01:21:24,745 --> 01:21:27,251
What the fuck? No, Chris is my best friend.

786
01:21:27,254 --> 01:21:30,780
Hey look, If you did something to him .. - I know you think about fucking me, Rod.

787
01:21:30,783 --> 01:21:34,260
Ain't nobody thought about fucking you. Why would you say some stupid shit What the...

788
01:21:34,263 --> 01:21:37,767
You ass. I didn't want to fuck you. Bye.

789
01:21:40,487 --> 01:21:44,952
God, she's so ... she's a fucking... She's ... God, She's a genius.

790
01:22:20,085 --> 01:22:22,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

791
01:22:25,570 --> 01:22:28,773
Hey, Chris. How's it going, buddy?

792
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:33,449
You can answer, there is an intercom in the room.

793
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:38,676
Where is Rose? - Oh, You dirty dog.

794
01:22:40,231 --> 01:22:42,851
You're one of the lucky ones, trust me.

795
01:22:42,854 --> 01:22:46,570
Jeremy's wrangling method sounds much less pleasant.

796
01:22:46,573 --> 01:22:52,990
I'm supposed to answer any outstanding questions or concerns you may have so far.

797
01:22:52,993 --> 01:22:56,781
Apparently our common understanding of the process ...

798
01:22:56,865 --> 01:23:00,379
has a positive impact on the success rate of the procedure.

799
01:23:04,652 --> 01:23:10,373
You could give a shit, right? Okay, just let me just tell you what it is?

800
01:23:11,064 --> 01:23:16,575
Phase one was the hypnotism. That's how they sedate you.

801
01:23:16,578 --> 01:23:22,603
Phase two is this. Mental preparation. It is basically a psychological pre-op.

802
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:27,574
Pre-op? - For stage three.

803
01:23:28,944 --> 01:23:30,549
Transplantation.

804
01:23:33,497 --> 01:23:35,678
Well, partial, actually.

805
01:23:35,681 --> 01:23:40,992
The piece of your brain connected to your nervous system needs to stay put...

806
01:23:40,995 --> 01:23:44,804
keeping those intricate connections intact.

807
01:23:45,115 --> 01:23:48,283
So you won't be gone. At least not completely.

808
01:23:48,416 --> 01:23:52,697
A sliver of you will still be in there somewhere. Limited consciousness.

809
01:23:57,075 --> 01:23:59,976
You'll be able to see and hear ...

810
01:24:00,972 --> 01:24:07,209
What your body is doing, but your existence will be as a passenger.

811
01:24:11,523 --> 01:24:16,024
An audience. You will live in ... - The Sunken Place.

812
01:24:16,497 --> 01:24:18,628
Now you're in the Sunken Place.

813
01:24:22,899 --> 01:24:26,017
Yeah. That's what she calls it.

814
01:24:26,493 --> 01:24:30,568
Now I will control the motor function, so I'll be ...

815
01:24:30,571 --> 01:24:31,603
Me.

816
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,777
You'll be me.

817
01:24:35,806 --> 01:24:38,026
Good, good.

818
01:24:38,294 --> 01:24:40,579
You got it quick. Good on you.

819
01:24:42,005 --> 01:24:43,304
Why us?

820
01:24:46,236 --> 01:24:47,752
Why black people?

821
01:24:51,321 --> 01:24:52,845
Who knows?

822
01:24:53,695 --> 01:25:00,084
People want to change. Some people want to be stronger ... faster ... cooler.

823
01:25:00,089 --> 01:25:02,221
Black is in fashion.

824
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:07,398
But please don't lump me in with that, you know I could give a shit what color you are.

825
01:25:07,401 --> 01:25:11,675
No, what I want is deeper.

826
01:25:13,339 --> 01:25:17,042
I want your eye, man.

827
01:25:18,801 --> 01:25:21,219
I want those things you see through.

828
01:25:23,565 --> 01:25:25,184
This is crazy.

829
01:25:28,087 --> 01:25:29,222
Okay, I'm done.

830
01:31:24,617 --> 01:31:27,741
Asshole.

831
01:31:34,257 --> 01:31:35,276
You ...

832
01:31:36,859 --> 01:31:38,654
Come on.

833
01:31:42,772 --> 01:31:46,431
One Mississippi, two Mississippi ...

834
01:31:47,014 --> 01:31:50,497
three Mississippi, four Mississippi ...

835
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:24,538
911. What is your emergency? - I'm in the house Armitage. My name is Chris.

836
01:33:24,679 --> 01:33:26,483
I'm sorry, sir, can you repeat that?

837
01:33:26,486 --> 01:33:28,657
I'm in ... I'm in the Armitage ...

838
01:33:43,524 --> 01:33:47,570
No, no, no don't do it. I just wanna go.

839
01:34:10,138 --> 01:34:11,576
Grandma

840
01:34:27,031 --> 01:34:30,909
You ruined my house.

841
01:35:14,131 --> 01:35:15,846
Get him grandpa

842
01:35:54,316 --> 01:35:55,528
Let me do it.

843
01:37:08,944 --> 01:37:10,590
I'm so sorry.

844
01:37:11,571 --> 01:37:12,908
It's me.

845
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:18,260
I love you.

846
01:37:20,096 --> 01:37:21,594
I love you.

847
01:38:10,206 --> 01:38:14,589
Help.

848
01:38:14,856 --> 01:38:16,361
Help me.

849
01:39:06,683 --> 01:39:08,879
I told you not to go in that house.

850
01:39:14,576 --> 01:39:15,632
I mean...

851
01:39:21,565 --> 01:39:22,968
How did you find me?

852
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:32,472
I'm TS motherfucking A.

853
01:39:33,178 --> 01:39:34,875
We handle shit.

854
01:39:35,082 --> 01:39:37,087
That's what we do.

855
01:39:39,497 --> 01:39:41,396
Consider this situation ...

856
01:39:41,872 --> 01:39:43,386
fucking handled.

857
01:40:21,222 --> 01:40:23,622
