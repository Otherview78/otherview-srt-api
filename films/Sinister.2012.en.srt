1
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,885
Just one box?

2
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,341
It's for my office.
It's fragile.

3
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,767
Sissy.

4
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,479
Hey, dude, headphones.
You're gonna go deaf!

5
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,593
An autograph?

6
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,853
I just thought that...

7
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,101
Are you kidding me?

8
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,690
Ma'am?

9
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,568
Sheriff?

10
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:25,903
Your husband around?

11
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,662
Ashley?

12
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,124
Ashley?

13
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,077
Honey.

14
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,755
Sweetheart.
What are you doing?

15
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:38,836
Painting.

16
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,294
Yeah, I know. I think your mom
wants your help unpacking.

17
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,178
I know.

18
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:44,922
So, why don't you come outside with me

19
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,256
and you can finish your painting later?

20
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,807
Because I didn't want to move here.

21
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,430
I shouldn't have to carry boxes.

22
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:53,355
We had to move here
and we all have to help carry boxes.

23
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,106
Uh-uh.
You wanted to move here.

24
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,275
No, I had to move here.

25
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,978
The new story I'm writing is here.

26
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,731
Why can't you just keep
writing in the old house?

27
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,032
Because I was gonna have to
write college textbooks

28
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,575
to pay for that old house.

29
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,073
And I can't do that.

30
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,245
Why not?

31
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,243
"Cause I just can't.

32
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,990
But I miss my school.

33
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,742
Well, you know what?

34
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,373
The school here
is supposed to be pretty great.

35
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,375
But I want my old one.

36
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,340
I know.

37
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,840
How about this?
All right? I tell you what.

38
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,009
If we don't like it here,

39
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,510
once I sell my book, we'll move back.

40
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,183
But only if we don't like it here.

41
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,764
-Really?
-Really.

42
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,596
You promise?

43
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,851
I promise.

44
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,773
But you have to promise to try to like it here.

45
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,358
- I promise.
-You do. Okay.

46
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,402
Now, my little artist,
what's the number one rule?

47
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,816
Paint only goes in the bedroom.

48
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:42,988
And where doesn't it go?

49
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,109
Anywhere else in the house.

50
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,783
Right. Come.
Now come with me.

51
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:46,984
Move some boxes.

52
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,034
Sheriff's here.

53
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,160
Already?

54
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,037
Play nice this time.

55
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,244
-I'm always nice.
-I'm not kidding.

56
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,337
I'm tired of driving
five miles under the speed limit

57
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,585
only to get ticketed anyway.

58
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,549
Be nice.

59
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,049
Afternoon.
Is there a problem?

60
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,681
No, sir.
Just a friendly visit.

61
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,759
I appreciate that.
Ellison Oswalt.

62
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,226
I know who you are.

63
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,555
-So, you're not a fan.
-No.

64
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,061
Well, what can I do for you?

65
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,610
Well, not much I expect,

66
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,649
unless I can convince you to load those

67
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,949
boxes back on that truck and
leave as soon as you're able.

68
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,075
No, I don't think so.

69
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,112
But you know what,
I do have a couple extra copies

70
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,534
of Kentucky Blood in my office.

71
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,614
If you want me to get one out

72
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,664
and sign it for you, I'll do that.

73
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,741
No, thank you, sir.

74
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,951
Is it the writing?

75
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,416
More a matter of content.

76
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,794
You don't seem
to care much for our profession.

77
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,342
Not everybody in your
profession gets it right.

78
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,803
I've read your books.
Neither do you.

79
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:49,922
Look...

80
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,303
Oh, you got it right in Kentucky Blood.

81
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,596
I'll give you that.

82
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,306
It's a fine piece of writing.

83
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,685
But Cold Denver Morning, you got it wrong.

84
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,731
Blood Diner...

85
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,274
Look, that wasn't my fault. All right?

86
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,523
Your bad theory helped a killer go free.

87
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,071
You ruined people's lives.

88
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,864
Now this town doesn't need that.

89
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,158
It needs to heal.
It needs to forget.

90
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,870
We sure don't want that circus
that you bring with you.

91
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,954
Well, there's a missing girl involved here.

92
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,532
She ain't missing.
She's dead.

93
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,082
Come on.
You don't know that.

94
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,912
If that girl is still alive, then it ain't no miracle

95
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,418
and we ain't ever gonna find her.

96
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,458
Then I guess we should just let it go. Huh?

97
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,173
You don't think the town
deserves an explanation?

98
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,712
Something like this?

99
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,966
You can never explain something like this.

100
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,140
And if you were able to, the odds are

101
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,271
you wouldn't much care for the answer.

102
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,598
Now, we did our job.
You'll see that.

103
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,934
And this is just another waste of your time

104
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,565
like your last two books.

105
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,823
If writing true crime has taught me one thing,

106
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,779
it's that whenever an officer of the law

107
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,577
tells me that I'm wasting my time,

108
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,829
it just means he thinks he's wasting his.

109
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,208
That's clever.
You ought to write that down.

110
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,415
Well, I'm gonna go out on a limb and

111
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,504
assume your department
is not at my disposal?

112
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,960
Well, what do you know?

113
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,883
You can still get things right on occasion.

114
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,010
Oh, and...

115
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:19,179
I find this to be in extremely bad taste.

116
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,157
-What was all that about?
-The usual.

117
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,701
He wanted an autograph,
but he left his copy at home.

118
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,903
He'll be back later.

119
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,074
-That bad?
-Mmm-hmm.

120
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,743
Why was he pointing at the house?

121
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,742
Ellison, we didn't move in

122
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,210
a few houses down
from a crime scene again, did we?

123
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,210
-Tracy.
-No, just don't say anything.

124
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,132
If we did, I don't want to know about it.

125
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,927
-We didn't.
-You promise?

126
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,387
I promise.

127
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,724
Here. Make yourself useful.

128
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,139
Kitchen.

129
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,555
It's gonna be good here, okay?
You'll see.

130
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,651
Oh, shit.

131
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,301
You gotta be kidding me.

132
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,683
Family Hanging Out, '11?

133
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,064
Barbeque, '79?

134
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,034
Look at this.

135
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,161
I've also got noodles
and fortune cookies.

136
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,206
Enjoy, kids.
We're not likely to be able

137
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,703
to eat out much this time.

138
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,797
-Why not?
-You know why.

139
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:52,918
I don't.

140
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,044
Well, we haven't sold the old house yet.

141
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,919
Once it's gone,
we'll be able to afford a few extra things.

142
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,174
Then sell it already.

143
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,345
Lower the price if you have to.

144
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,888
No, we've already
lowered it as much as we can

145
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,010
without losing money.

146
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,433
The market's terrible.

147
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,602
Once we're not paying
two mortgages, we'll be fine.

148
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,305
Once I sell my new book,
we'll be on easy street.

149
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,935
Is the story a good one this time?

150
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,482
Yeah, it's good.
Of course it is.

151
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,730
Will you take me
and show me where it happened?

152
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:13,897
Trevor!

153
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,195
What? I'm old enough
to know about this stuff.

154
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,316
No. You're not.

155
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,614
Even I'm not old enough
to know about this stuff.

156
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,401
Your father writes about
terrible, terrible things

157
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,527
that I don't want you
knowing anything about.

158
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,827
You say that like
I shouldn't be writing about it.

159
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:23,904
That's not what I meant.

160
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,371
That's the way you say it.

161
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,075
Well, I'm gonna
hear about it at school anyway.

162
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,201
Kids will all hate me again

163
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,626
and tell me nonstop about what happened.

164
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,044
Hey, nobody hates you.

165
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,876
Well, I might as well hear it from you.

166
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,256
Are you listening to this?

167
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,466
Yes, I'm listening.

168
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,510
Let's at least make sure
your office stays locked.

169
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,677
It's one thing to hear about it,

170
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,879
it's another thing to see it.

171
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,965
I don't want him walking in again.
He's 12 years old.

172
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,595
Mom, he knows how old I am.

173
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:45,847
Hey, stop it.

174
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:46,972
What's the first rule?

175
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,098
Never go in Dad's office.

176
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,221
Good.

177
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,646
And what's the rule?

178
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,433
-Always lock Dad's office.
-That's right.

179
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,901
And I don't want to hear another thing

180
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:56,937
about why we're here.
From anybody.

181
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,154
Yeah.

182
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,781
You haven't brushed your teeth.

183
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,749
No. Not yet.

184
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,118
You're not coming to bed?

185
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,247
No, I thought I'd

186
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,331
set up my office first and get started.

187
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,462
-How long is it gonna be?
-Just an hour or two.

188
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:21,303
No, I mean, how long
are we here for this time?

189
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,423
Oh, God, I don't know.
It could be a long one.

190
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,259
I liked it better when you were writing fiction.

191
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,187
Nobody likes my fiction.

192
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,559
Maybe you should try again?

193
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,231
Tracy, I can't do this without you by my side.

194
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,774
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

195
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,601
I'm on your side.

196
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,940
I just want to see you
enjoying your work again.

197
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,784
When you're happy,

198
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,069
we're all happy.

199
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,371
I just need another hit, that's all.

200
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,241
Just one more.

201
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,417
I just...

202
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,625
What?

203
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,714
You know I'm behind you on this.

204
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,835
I know.

205
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,003
But that's not what you were gonna say.

206
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,297
What were you gonna say?

207
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,134
Kentucky Blood was 10 years ago.

208
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,799
And?

209
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:08,975
And...

210
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,852
What if that was your 15 minutes?

211
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,186
Okay, what if it was?

212
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,109
If it was, you can't just

213
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,688
spend the rest of your life chasing after it.

214
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,232
If you miss out on these years with the kids,

215
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,566
you won't get them back.

216
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,698
I just need one more chance.
That's all. One more.

217
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,160
I got a really good feeling
about this. I really do.

218
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,363
Okay, good.

219
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,832
But, Ell, I don't think I can do this again.

220
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,330
Honey, you're not gonna have to.

221
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,002
No, I mean it.

222
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,048
If this goes sour like last time,

223
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,126
I'll take Trevor and Ashley

224
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,336
and go back home to my sister's.

225
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,890
Is that fair?

226
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,092
It is.

227
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,395
But it's not gonna go sour.

228
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,807
Do you wanna? Easy.

229
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,892
Good. Now go kick some ass.

230
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,620
What the hell.
Let's do this.

231
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,986
All right.

232
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,143
Why would you film it?

233
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,727
Daddy, I can't find the bathroom.

234
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,811
Come here.

235
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,987
Come on. Come on.
We'll get you...

236
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,362
Thank you, Daddy.

237
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,044
Look at all these new paintings.

238
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,298
-You're really getting good.
-Thank you.

239
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,046
Maybe one day I'll paint
something really good.

240
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,673
Then I'll be famous like you.

241
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,222
I'm sure you will, princess.

242
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,386
All right.
Get some sleep.

243
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,512
Okay.

244
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,138
-And, Daddy?
-Yes?

245
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,473
Are you gonna write
a really good book this time

246
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,808
SO we can go home?

247
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,941
I'm gonna write the best book
that anyone's ever read.

248
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,295
Operator.

249
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,172
Yeah, King County Police, please.

250
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,345
Is this an emergency?

251
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,932
Yes, yes, it is.

252
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,279
King County Police Department,

253
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,863
how may I direct your call?

254
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,239
King County Police Department,
how may I direct your call?

255
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,199
Hello?

256
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,369
Hello?

257
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,049
All right.

258
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,270
You came back and left the box.

259
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,272
Why?

260
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,553
Damn it, Ashley.

261
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,183
Ashley?

262
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,363
Trevor! Trevor, Trevor, hey!

263
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,248
Wake up, Trevor, wake up.

264
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,160
Hey, wake up, wake up, all right?

265
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,086
Okay, okay, come on, come on.

266
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,038
Oh, my God,
is he okay?

267
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,373
No, he's having
one of those...

268
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,668
Come on, back it up. Wake up.
Hey, come on outside.

269
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,925
Come on, hey, wake up, buddy,
all right? Hey, wake up!

270
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,388
Come on, come on, wake up.

271
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,842
Wake up! Wake up! Trevor,
wake up for me, all right?

272
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,770
Hey! Hey! Look at the stars!
Trevor! Trevor, Trevor.

273
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,691
Why are we outside?

274
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,268
All right, bud. Okay.

275
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,440
You're having a bad dream, okay?

276
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:33,813
One of those night terrors.

277
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,356
Just go back to sleep.

278
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,862
I thought these were over.

279
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,986
It's just the stress of the move.
I found him in

280
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,703
one of the moving boxes.

281
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,825
Poor baby.

282
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,408
He'll be all right in a few hours.

283
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,415
Oh, Tracy.

284
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,088
What is it?
What's the matter?

285
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,293
I wanna tell you something.

286
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,677
Okay.

287
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,508
I'm just really sorry.

288
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,975
It's not your fault.
Come on.

289
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,897
It's cold.
Let's go inside.

290
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,990
I was in a box?

291
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:20,451
You were in a box.

292
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,743
I don't remember any of that.

293
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,070
Yeah, well, it's not the strangest place

294
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,200
we've ever found you.

295
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,622
Please don't talk about the dryer.

296
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,291
Are we talking
about the time we found Trevor

297
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,742
trying to pee in the dryer?

298
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,044
-God, Mom, no! No.
-I'm sorry, honey.

299
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,213
I thought that's what you were talking about.

300
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,540
Did Trevor try to pee
in the dryer again?

301
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:35,625
Mom!

302
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,800
Ashley, honey, no,

303
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,002
your brother just had a night terror.

304
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,171
-Is that like a bad dream?
-Kind of.

305
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,757
Oh, I think I had one of those.

306
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,513
No, a night terror
is a special kind of bad dream.

307
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,936
We would have remembered
if you had one. Don't do that.

308
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,513
Come on, you can just sit right here.

309
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,098
So, Ashley, you excited about

310
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,934
your first day at the new school?

311
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,734
-What about you?
-I guess.

312
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:55,857
Yeah, it's nice to see you're both so...

313
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:56,983
Ashley!

314
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,064
...enthusiastic about our adventure!

315
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,148
Stop it.

316
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:00,733
- Hey, you two stop it!
- Stop.

317
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,410
Stop it.
Be the bigger person.

318
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:03,869
Are you gonna take them?

319
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,367
Yeah, I've got some errands to run.

320
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,868
I figured I'd get the lay of the land

321
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,415
and let you get some work done.

322
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,913
Eat up, kids, you're running late.

323
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:10,959
Come on, you heard your mother.

324
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,787
Grab some road breakfast and skedaddle.

325
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,455
I left you a fresh pot of coffee.

326
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,711
Oh, thanks.

327
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,882
Have a nice morning
with your murder victims.

328
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,005
Yes, dear.

329
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,632
Come on. Trevor,
where's your notebook?

330
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,463
It should be
in my backpack.

331
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:35,437
Oh, fuck.

332
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,657
Okay.

333
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,199
Super 8 film was first released in 1966

334
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,496
by Eastman Kodak.

335
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:55,763
Trevor,
don't walk away from me

336
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,844
while I'm talking to you!

337
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,428
Ashley, close the door.
Trevor!

338
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,809
What on earth were you thinking?

339
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,641
You asked me that
and I'll tell you again.

340
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:02,941
I wasn't thinking.

341
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,769
That's your problem,
you don't think!

342
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,024
You want to be treated like an adult,

343
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,229
but you don't act like one!

344
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,031
Oh, yeah,
'cause you and Dad do lots of thinking.

345
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,323
If you did, we wouldn't be here!

346
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,650
You don't know what you're talking about.

347
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:13,736
-I know more than you.
-Go to your room, Trevor!

348
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,491
And I don't want to
see you again until dinner!

349
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,243
-Fine!
-Hey, hey, hey! What happened?

350
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,371
-Mom's overreacting.
-Your son is acting out again.

351
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:20,951
All right.
What did he do?

352
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,707
So you're automatically taking her side?

353
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,539
Hey, stop it!
What did you do?

354
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,377
-I drew a picture.
-He drew a picture

355
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,833
with a permanent marker
on the classroom whiteboard.

356
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:28,963
Oh, God.

357
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,294
-Trevor.
-Tell him what you drew.

358
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,379
I drew a tree.

359
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,384
With four people hanging from it!

360
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,465
Go to your room, Trevor.

361
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,970
I need to speak to your father.

362
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,220
His first day at school, Ellison.

363
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,476
And he's already hearing
the grisly details of your mystery?

364
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,556
All right, what did he hear?

365
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,766
Exactly what he drew!

366
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,851
That your book is about
a family that was hung?

367
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,277
-Yeah.
-Christ, Ellison!

368
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,354
But that's all he heard?

369
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,438
That's not enough?

370
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,071
Look, I'm sorry he had to find out like this.

371
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,401
All right? I am.

372
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,453
But come on, I mean,
it was bound to happen.

373
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,907
Really? That's your response?
You think that makes it okay?

374
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,911
No, it doesn't make it okay, all right?

375
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,040
Nothing about what happened
to these people is okay.

376
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,838
But bad things happen to good people

377
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,005
and they still need

378
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,424
to have their story told.
They deserve that much.

379
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,093
You're a real man of the people.

380
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,340
Oh, come on.

381
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,606
I'm putting the kids to bed.

382
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,354
Kiss them good night for me.

383
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:28,731
You're getting good work done?

384
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:29,945
Yeah.

385
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:31,397
Good.

386
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,357
Please keep the door closed.

387
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,170
Okay, 1998.

388
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,523
New details today in the grisly murders

389
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,897
of a local family found earlier this week.

390
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,488
Police have released this
photo of Christopher Miller,

391
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:45,029
the missing 13-year-old son
of William and Penny Miller.

392
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,610
The Millers along with their younger son

393
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:47,786
were found stabbed

394
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,163
inside their home and police now

395
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,832
are asking for any information

396
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,034
that could lead to Christopher's return

397
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,961
or the apprehension of any suspects

398
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,503
involved in this vicious

399
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,124
multiple murder and child abduction.

400
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,767
Shit!

401
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,178
Family Hanging Out.

402
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,312
Pool Party.

403
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,196
Barbeque.

404
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,321
Sleepy Time.

405
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:15,957
Okay.

406
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,940
Really, I'm fine.

407
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,195
I'd prefer to take you down to the hospital

408
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,275
to have this checked out.

409
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,701
I think you should get stitches.

410
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,987
-Can't force you, though.
-Yeah, and I'm not gonna go.

411
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,072
All right, well.

412
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,243
The bleeding's stopped for now,

413
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,117
but if it starts again or if
there's any more swelling,

414
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,701
I want you to call a doctor immediately.

415
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:52,877
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

416
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,375
-Okay.
-Yeah.

417
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:56,797
This way.

418
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:57,874
So.

419
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,923
Let's go see this hole.

420
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,716
So, you say
you heard a loud thump

421
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,643
and footsteps in the attic
after the power went out?

422
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,810
Yes.

423
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,684
But the ladder wasn't down?

424
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,061
No, it wasn't.

425
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,603
It's not possible
to close it from inside the attic?

426
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:18,819
Nope.

427
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,447
So, how would an intruder get up there?

428
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:23,825
I didn't say anyone was up there.

429
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,822
I just said it sounded like
there was an intruder.

430
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,529
I did see a small snake, though.

431
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,829
Snakes don't have feet.

432
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,999
You know, I'm guessing
that you got squirrels.

433
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,123
With no way in or out up there and

434
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,421
all the power gone off in the neighborhood,

435
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:41,881
I bet that they got spooked

436
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:44,679
from the sound of everything
shutting down at once.

437
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,264
You know how they are.

438
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,762
No, not really.
I'm not really a squirrel guy.

439
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:50,180
Uh-huh.

440
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,767
I did kill a scorpion
when we first moved in here, though,

441
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,348
so maybe I should get an exterminator.

442
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,599
Scorpions have feet,

443
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,482
but you wouldn't hear them
like you would squirrels.

444
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:04,525
Well, Officer, thank you very much. It's...

445
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,117
[ will...

446
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,364
If there's anything else I can do for you.

447
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,661
Actually, there is.

448
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,204
I left my copy of Kentucky Blood

449
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,372
down at the station.

450
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,245
It'll really mean a lot to me
if you signed a copy.

451
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,077
Okay. Of course. I got a few
extra copies in my office.

452
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,538
Thank you so much.
That's so great.

453
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:20,957
Wow, do you know what?

454
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,168
This is like one of them FBI prof tier's offices.

455
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:24,465
You got a map with pictures

456
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,091
connected with yarn and everything.

457
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:27,263
Deputy, I need you to step outside.

458
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,340
This is incredible.

459
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,137
No, no, no. This is my
private office. I'm serious.

460
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,263
Just wait outside.

461
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,015
I know, Mr. Oswalt.
Listen, you know, there's...

462
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:34,687
You know there's a page in your books

463
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,805
where you always say

464
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,982
nice things
about all the people that helped you out.

465
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,815
-The acknowledgements?
-Yeah, well.

466
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:43,313
Yeah, and in each one, there's always like a

467
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,652
line that says, you know,

468
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,733
"I couldn't have done this

469
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,317
"without the tireless efforts of

470
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,822
"Deputy So and So from
the local police department.”

471
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,077
Right.

472
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,038
Well, you know, I could be, like,

473
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:59,705
you know, your Deputy So and So, you know.

474
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,126
I mean, if you don't already have one.

475
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,959
Yeah, there are a few things
you could do for me, actually.

476
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,339
-Really?
-Yeah, this could be perfect.

477
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,419
Do you have a notepad?

478
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:07,595
Uh...

479
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,054
Yes.

480
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,555
All right.
Do you need a pen?

481
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,346
Yes.

482
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:19,558
I need the street address of a crime.

483
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,235
In 1998, St. Louis,
a family was stabbed to death.

484
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:23,319
Actually, they had their throats cut.

485
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:24,441
It was a pretty ugly affair.

486
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:25,522
Okay.

487
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,948
I also need any details
you can get me on another murder.

488
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,618
1979, a family was burned alive,

489
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:33,037
parked inside their own car,
in their own garage.

490
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:34,823
What city?

491
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,078
I don't know.
All I have is the year

492
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,541
and the method of execution.

493
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,035
Hmm.

494
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,545
You think that the two cases are related?

495
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,418
Oh, no, no, I'm just doing research.

496
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:44,632
Okay.

497
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,710
I can definitely get this for you.

498
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,712
Yeah, I gotta wait
till the Sheriff leaves the office,

499
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:49,887
but I will get it.

500
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,557
Thank you very much,
Deputy So and So.

501
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,605
-I'm sorry.
-For what?

502
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,982
I was angry at Trevor today
and I took it out on you.

503
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,150
No, don't be sorry.

504
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,228
I know the move's been hard for you.

505
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,360
I'm trying, Ell.
I really am.

506
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,736
I know it.

507
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,817
I just want you here with me.
That's all.

508
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:15,246
I've always been with you.
And I'm with you now.

509
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:26,549
Pleased to have Ellison Oswalt
on our program tonight.

510
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,467
His new book is called Kentucky Blood.

511
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:29,757
Hey, Ellison, good to have you on.

512
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,258
Thanks for having me. It's a real pleasure.

513
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:34,512
Man, I got into this.
This is pretty graphic stuff, so

514
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:35,683
let me start by asking

515
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,477
why you spend so much time investigating

516
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,228
such grisly content.

517
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:40,805
Fame and money?

518
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,438
No, I'm just kidding.
The honest answer is that I...

519
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:47,396
I'm really driven by a sense of injustice.

520
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,480
You know, when [ think about

521
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:49,902
the awful things that
happened to these people

522
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,404
and that those responsible
were never even identified,

523
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:53,610
let alone caught.

524
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,195
I mean, I knew when I started
this particular case

525
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,201
that I might stumble on a few things that

526
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,532
maybe somebody'd overlooked.

527
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,209
Might stumble?
No, you in fact did...

528
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,410
Yeah. Yeah.

529
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,586
...uncover some additional information

530
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,878
that the cops had overlooked.

531
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:06,923
Well, look, first off, let me say that

532
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,716
there are a lot of good police officers

533
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:09,793
out there and I don't want to in any way

534
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,673
-disparage what they do.
-Right.

535
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:12,921
But in police work

536
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,471
getting something wrong means

537
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,673
<i>ruining people's lives.</i>

538
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,551
Good crime writing can set things right.

539
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,474
So ultimately, what feels better?

540
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,685
Seeing justice done or seeing your book,

541
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,600
Kentucky Blood, number one

542
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,310
on the New York Times Bestseller List?

543
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,271
The justice.

544
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,398
Without question.

545
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:33,949
I'd rather cut my hands off

546
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,027
than write a book for fame or money.

547
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,614
Are you making Daddy his coffee?

548
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:19,782
Yes.

549
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,700
Can I help?
I want to bring it to him.

550
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,537
Sure, honey,
but we have to make it just right.

551
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,031
He's very particular about his coffee.

552
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,967
Brought you your coffee, Daddy.

553
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,049
Oh, thank you, sweetheart. Oh.

554
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,436
Yeah, hello.

555
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,637
Hey, Mr. Oswalt.

556
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,601
Hey, Deputy So and So.

557
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,649
Listen, I'm sorry
to get back to you so late in the day.

558
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,272
I couldn't make the call from the office.

559
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,443
You know, the Sheriff.

560
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,611
Yeah, I understand.

561
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,484
But I got what you asked about.

562
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:02,442
There was a Martinez family
in Sacramento, California,

563
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,573
that died in their garage in 1979.

564
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:05,740
Their car was set on fire.

565
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:06,988
One of their sons, he was nine years old.

566
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,117
They never found him.

567
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,448
Do you have the street address?

568
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:13,586
Yeah, it's 8224 Billington, Sacramento.

569
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:14,670
And what about St. Louis?

570
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:15,838
The address of the house where

571
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,414
the Miller murders occurred

572
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,669
is 2976 Piedmont Way, St. Louis.

573
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:22,549
That is excellent. 2-9...

574
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,798
Wait, did you say "2976," like 29-767

575
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,383
Yeah, why, does that
mean something to you?

576
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:30,307
No, no, it doesn't. No.
Thank you, thank you, Deputy.

577
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,517
Before the Stevensons moved here,

578
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,604
they lived where the Miller
family murders happened.

579
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,276
Holy shit.

580
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:06,987
Ashley?

581
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,778
Trevor?

582
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:32,132
Oh, my God, is he okay?

583
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,805
I found him outside.

584
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,303
We have to put a lock on his door.

585
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:37,550
It's way worse than it was.

586
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,180
I'll call the doctor in the morning.

587
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:47,105
Now you stay with him.
I left something outside.

588
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,668
Good dog.

589
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,715
Good dog.

590
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:17,639
I don't want to hurt you.

591
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:23,683
I just want to get my bat.

592
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,901
So if you come at me,
I can bash your head in. Okay?

593
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,316
That's fine.
You keep it.

594
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:43,457
You okay?

595
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,250
Yeah, I'm fine. Fine.

596
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,371
Trevor's too old to still be having these.

597
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,589
He was supposed to have
outgrown them by now.

598
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:51,965
He's all right.
He's okay.

599
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,042
Just stop.

600
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:55,549
Stop what?

601
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:56,720
Drop the book.

602
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:00,550
We can pack up,
get out of town and never look back.

603
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:02,222
Oh, why, 'cause he's
having some night terrors?

604
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:03,640
No, no, it's more than that.

605
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,188
He's never been this bad.
You've never been this bad.

606
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,264
What are you talking about?

607
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:08,391
You've been at this book for less than a week

608
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:10,063
-and you're already a mess.
-I'm a mess?

609
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,651
You never crack into the whiskey this early

610
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:12,773
and never this often.

611
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:13,896
Oh, what, now you're saying I'm a drunk?

612
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,067
No, no, no, I'm saying...

613
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,156
Tracy, stop it.

614
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,278
...there's something you aren't telling me.

615
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:18,867
Something that's
eating you up and whatever it is,

616
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,695
it seems to be getting to Trevor as well.

617
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:21,779
Something's different this time.

618
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,326
Yes, something's different.
You wanna know what it is?

619
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:24,999
How much do you want to know?

620
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:26,325
I want to know why you're different.

621
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,081
I'm different because I've never

622
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,916
been onto something this big before.

623
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,497
Do you remember how it was
when I was writing Kentucky,

624
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,547
do you remember that?

625
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:33,624
I remember.

626
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,421
Well, this is much bigger than that! Much!

627
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:38,463
I am talking about
potentially important work here.

628
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:39,713
I'm talking about

629
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,428
<i>a mega-hit.
This could be my In Cold Blood.</i>

630
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:45,974
A movie deal, a talk show circuit, right?

631
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,312
A National Book Award.

632
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,098
And more money than we could, you know...

633
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,269
We could live wherever we wanted to.

634
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:51,358
I don't care about any of that.

635
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:52,435
Yes, you do!

636
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:53,936
Everybody does, and this is my shot, Tracy!

637
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,107
I just...

638
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:57,777
You just what?

639
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:00,359
I'm just worried about you.

640
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,411
Well, don't be.

641
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:04,613
Nothing is wrong.

642
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,242
Then why did you come in white as a ghost?

643
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:11,336
Because I saw a dog. Okay?

644
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:12,500
A dog?

645
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:15,374
A very big dog, like Cujo big.

646
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:17,631
I mean, I'd never seen him before.
He's like...

647
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,838
-Did you get rid of him?
-Yeah, he's gone. He's gone.

648
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,466
Listen, I just need a little more time, okay?

649
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,975
I promise it's worth it.

650
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:29,396
Every minute that we're here,
we're a minute closer

651
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:31,850
to that happy ending
that we always dreamed of.

652
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,316
We're almost there.

653
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,478
Okay.

654
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,359
Deputy.

655
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:44,032
Mr. Oswalt, these came in this morning.

656
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,120
I had a few of the

657
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:48,040
pertinent files pulled for you
and had them faxed over.

658
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:49,579
-Really?
-Yeah.

659
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,330
-Thanks.
-No problem.

660
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,538
Do you think I could come in for a second?

661
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,005
Uh...

662
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:57,841
Yeah, sure.

663
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,509
-Thanks.
-Come on, just here.

664
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,675
Look, I know what you must think of me.

665
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:06,221
Some small-town deputy that's starstruck

666
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:09,311
with the famous writer,
but I'm not some local moron.

667
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:12,389
I didn't say you were a...
You know.

668
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:14,104
I have a degree in criminology.

669
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:17,528
I've taken my fair share
of forensic science courses.

670
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:21,323
I also know a series of connected murders

671
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,195
when I see one, Mr. Oswalt.

672
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:25,660
-Look.
-Listen, we missed something.

673
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,862
I get that.

674
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,914
But if you want me to run interference for you

675
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,203
while you get this worked out,

676
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:33,661
I gotta be in the loop.
Just a little bit.

677
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,208
You really want to help?

678
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:39,758
It's my home, Mr. Oswalt.

679
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,547
What happened here happened to all of us.

680
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,513
All right. Come here.

681
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,354
Who is that?

682
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,525
I don't know.

683
01:00:58,155 --> 01:00:59,896
That's what I'm hoping to find out.

684
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,567
You think these are serial murders?

685
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:08,287
Maybe. More ritualized
than necessarily serial.

686
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,363
But really spread out.

687
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,947
And not just regionally, but over time.

688
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:13,374
The first one I found dates back to the '60s.

689
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:16,162
The 1960s?

690
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:17,337
Yeah.

691
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,923
Wait, that would put the guy,
what, in his 70s?

692
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,375
Or his 60s.

693
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,592
Yeah, I...

694
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:24,511
I don't know.

695
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:25,588
Well, look at the methodology.

696
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,844
Toxicology reports some cases

697
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,174
the killer drugged his victims.

698
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:30,509
With what?

699
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:33,020
They couldn't tell for sure.

700
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,680
But by drugging them,

701
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,765
the killer removes his need
to overpower them.

702
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,939
Here he used a tree branch
to do the heavy lifting.

703
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,987
In Sacramento, he lit a family on fire.

704
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,859
In St. Louis, he slit their throats.

705
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,486
The first family he drowned.

706
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:46,783
Drowning, you didn't...

707
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,111
You never said anything
about anyone being drowned.

708
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:50,908
The only other significant link

709
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:52,785
between the murder cases is that

710
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:56,456
in each instance the killer
murdered the entire family except one.

711
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,499
A child, which he took with him.

712
01:01:58,590 --> 01:01:59,705
That and

713
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,374
this symbol appears in several of the

714
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,376
crime scenes.

715
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:06,629
That looks like something
from out of the occult.

716
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:08,797
Look,

717
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:11,304
you might want to call the university.

718
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,726
There's a professor over there.
Professor Jonas.

719
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,178
He's an occult crime expert

720
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,264
and the state police
bring him in on some of the...

721
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:18,978
The weirder stuff.

722
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:21,109
I think this qualifies.

723
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:24,317
So, where do you think
that drowning happened?

724
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,482
That's what I need you to find out.

725
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,401
Okay.

726
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,546
-Professor Jonas?
-Yes.

727
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,806
Hello, hey, thank you
for getting back to me so quickly.

728
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:58,141
I appreciate that.

729
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:01,144
Of course, I'm a really big fan.
I'm flattered that you...

730
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:02,221
Thank you.

731
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,897
Once I saw the photos that you sent,

732
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,974
I knew exactly what cases that

733
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,226
you were studying.

734
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,402
Wait, how would you know
what cases I was looking at?

735
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:14,154
The symbol that you sent me
isn't a pentagram.

736
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:15,909
No, it's not something that you would see

737
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,736
teenagers or a Norwegian

738
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:18,912
black metal band paint on the wall

739
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,079
in goat's blood to be edgy.

740
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,327
Right.

741
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,824
Or to piss off the Christians.

742
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,752
No, this is a little bit more obscure than that.

743
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:29,464
Yeah, I know that one in the hallway.

744
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:34,511
That's from the late '90s in St. Louis.
The other one,

745
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,926
the car hood.
That is from Sacramento.

746
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,507
That's about 30 years ago.

747
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,510
Tell me about the one in Sacramento.

748
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:45,856
It's a symbol associated with
the worship of a pagan deity.

749
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,682
A deity?
What kind of deity?

750
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:49,935
A very obscure one,

751
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:51,940
dating back to Babylonian times.

752
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:55,156
Named Bughuul.
The Eater of Children.

753
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:56,696
Did you say "Eater"?

754
01:05:57,328 --> 01:06:01,322
Yes, of children.
Thank you, Jessica.

755
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,031
The crimes that you're dealing with,

756
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,705
they all have the element
of a missing child, correct?

757
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:07,123
Yes. Yeah.

758
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:08,787
That's correct.

759
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:11,169
Well, Bughuul eats children.

760
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:14,551
Now the fragments of stories
that have survived,

761
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,799
they all revolve around him

762
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,881
needing the souls of human children

763
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:22,343
to survive.
Now each story

764
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:25,683
involves a different way that he lures

765
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,806
or tricks these children

766
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,687
away from the physical world

767
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:33,479
and traps them in his own netherworld

768
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:36,235
and he consumes their souls over time.

769
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,237
Now any worship of this deity

770
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:40,695
would include a blood sacrifice.

771
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,997
Or the wholesale eating of a child.

772
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,994
So, you're saying the person
that made this symbol

773
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,917
is eating children?

774
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,712
Well, that would fit the stories.

775
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,750
Of course, the few times
that this symbol has shown up,

776
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,505
none of the crimes have been related

777
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:58,212
in any way to any of this.

778
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:02,345
So this might be more of
a cult initiation rather than,

779
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,769
you know, the actual actions of any one man.

780
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:11,066
There's been another one, hasn't there?

781
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:16,939
I think so. Yes.

782
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:19,779
Tell me everything you can.

783
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:10,630
So, I appreciate
you coming by, Officer.

784
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:13,420
Oh, yeah, it's not a problem at all.

785
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:16,468
So, we're becoming friends.
Right?

786
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,425
I suppose, yeah.

787
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:20,594
I mean, I can trust you, right?

788
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:21,928
Yeah, absolutely.

789
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:25,307
So, if I were to ask you something in earnest,

790
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:27,434
you wouldn't read too much into it?

791
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:28,852
Um...

792
01:13:29,322 --> 01:13:30,312
All right.

793
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:33,486
Was there anything

794
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,612
weird about the Stevensons?

795
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:45,209
No complaints from them
about anything strange?

796
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:48,838
No, not to my knowledge.

797
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:50,252
The investigators, did they notice

798
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:52,960
anything odd
or inexplicable about the house?

799
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:55,261
Any weird stories?

800
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:56,429
No.

801
01:13:57,725 --> 01:14:00,558
Mr. Oswalt,
is there something that you want to tell me?

802
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,940
Okay, look, clearly something happened and

803
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:09,517
you want to talk to somebody about it, right?

804
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:10,815
Yeah.

805
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:13,981
Okay, well, does your wife know about it?

806
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,194
Wait,

807
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:23,032
does she know whose house this is? Was?

808
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:31,627
Oh, man! Oh, that is a conversation that

809
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,207
I would not want to be around for.

810
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,383
No, me neither.

811
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:37,171
I'm sorry, so... So what?

812
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:38,880
You saw something weird,

813
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:40,506
heard something spooky in the house?

814
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,893
Yes. Precisely.

815
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:45,561
What exactly?

816
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:48,098
Now...

817
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:52,189
I don't believe in any...

818
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:54,946
You know, stuff.

819
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:57,111
Stuff, you mean, the...

820
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:58,900
The supernatural, the metaphysical,

821
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:00,447
the paranormal, that type of stuff?

822
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:01,535
Right.

823
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:03,579
Right. Of course you don't.

824
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,790
You never would have moved
into a crime scene if you did.

825
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,579
But here we are,

826
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,206
having this conversation.

827
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:10,412
Yeah, but...

828
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:13,752
But there was...
There was none of that,

829
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:18,094
you know, none of that
with the Stevensons, eh?

830
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,881
No. In the short amount of time

831
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:22,261
that the Stevensons lived here,

832
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:23,641
they never called the police,

833
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,385
they never had the police called on them

834
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:26,640
or reported anything bizarre

835
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,479
that came up in the investigation.

836
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:30,769
Do you want to know what I think?

837
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:31,936
Yes.

838
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,817
I think that you moved yourself

839
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,406
into the house of murder victims

840
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:40,858
and immediately set about

841
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,535
trying to put yourself in their headspace.

842
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:45,158
And I also think that you've
begun discovering

843
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,406
things about this case

844
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,288
that go to darker places
than you are prepared for.

845
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:51,710
I also think that every time

846
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,253
that I've been to your house,

847
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,580
there's a whiskey bottle in your office...

848
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:55,665
No, no, no.

849
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,383
...that doesn't appear to be
the slightest bit neglected.

850
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:59,586
Mr. Oswalt, listen, I don't...

851
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,546
I'm not saying that you
have a drinking problem.

852
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,301
-Right, okay. 'Cause...
- I don't think that.

853
01:16:03,434 --> 01:16:05,516
Nor do I think that you're
making any of this up...

854
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:06,634
No!

855
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:08,227
...to get attention.
I don't think that.

856
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:09,804
What I do think is that

857
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:12,056
you are under so much stress,

858
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:13,562
you've put yourself under so much stress

859
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:17,270
that your mind is trying
to process all of it at once.

860
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:19,772
So you don't believe

861
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:23,280
any of that otherworldly stuff, right?

862
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:27,117
Are you kidding me?
I believe in all that stuff.

863
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,625
I wouldn't sleep one night
in this place. Are you nuts?

864
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,372
Four people were hung by their necks

865
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:33,711
in the tree in your backyard.

866
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,000
And that little girl is probably, like,

867
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:37,169
God knows whatever,
God knows what...

868
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:40,669
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You know what?

869
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:43,216
You should try and get out more, Mr. Oswalt.

870
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:44,714
Try to clear your head.

871
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:47,554
Total honesty?

872
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:54,148
Last night, I thought

873
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:57,644
something was in the house.

874
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:02,198
And I woke up on the couch
holding a baseball bat.

875
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:08,451
Well, I guess if I thought
something was in my home

876
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,578
at night I'd be a little bit freaked out, too.

877
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:12,575
But listen, Mr. Oswalt.

878
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:15,503
If you sleep in this house,

879
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:17,921
it's just gonna do
terrible things to your head.

880
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:23,423
Ellison!

881
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:26,923
-Ellison!
-What's going on?

882
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,970
Your daughter apparently
thought there wasn't enough

883
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,722
room on her walls for her new painting.

884
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:31,936
Ashley!

885
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:33,054
No, that's not it!

886
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,101
What did we talk about?
We only gave you one rule.

887
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:37,066
It was a big deal for us to
let you paint on your walls.

888
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,980
And what was it?
What's the rule, Ashley?

889
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:40,482
Paint only goes in the bedroom.

890
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:42,530
And what makes you think
you can paint out here?

891
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:43,777
I wanted
to paint her picture,

892
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,320
but she didn't want it in my room

893
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,322
because that used to be her brother's room.

894
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:48,744
What?

895
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:50,496
Who are you talking about?

896
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:51,823
Stephanie.

897
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:53,408
Who's Stephanie?

898
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:54,788
She used to live here.

899
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:57,625
She's the one Daddy's
writing his book about.

900
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:05,715
Ashley, go to your room
and shut the door.

901
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:16,313
What the hell were you thinking?

902
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:18,183
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

903
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:20,439
Of course I knew you were
gonna find out eventually.

904
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:21,561
Okay.

905
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:23,441
But don't blame me for not telling you, okay,

906
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:24,609
"cause remember you never wanted to know.

907
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:25,698
Don't try and pin this on me!

908
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:26,774
You wouldn't...
You never let me!

909
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,117
I asked you, I asked you

910
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:30,111
if we were living
near the house and you said no!

911
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:32,493
You asked me if we were living
two houses down from a crime.

912
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:34,244
-No! Don't you dare!
-I said no. Well.

913
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:35,541
<i>We never should have come here!</i>

914
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:37,539
Tracy, nobody died here, okay?

915
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:39,120
It's not like we're sleeping
where somebody was killed!

916
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:41,047
It's not like they had to
wipe blood off the walls

917
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:42,168
for the open house!

918
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:43,416
Wait, so you're saying it didn't happen here?

919
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:46,218
No. It happened in the backyard.

920
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:47,636
Oh, that is so sick.

921
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:49,347
God, you think that makes a difference?

922
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:50,556
-Yeah, it does!
-No, Ellison! It doesn't!

923
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:51,804
Tracy. It does.

924
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:54,135
You have done some crazy shit in the past,

925
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:55,761
but this definitely takes the cake.

926
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:58,685
My God, what on earth
possessed you to move here?

927
01:18:58,817 --> 01:18:59,978
We've never been this broke before, okay?

928
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:01,100
-That's no excuse!
-We haven't.

929
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:02,902
This place came on the market, it was a steal

930
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,774
-for what the...
-Gee, I wonder why?

931
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:08,821
So, what Trevor drew last week,
that happened here?

932
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:11,410
Yes.

933
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:14,034
The previous owners of this home were hung

934
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:15,577
from a tree in our backyard?

935
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:16,658
Yes.

936
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,788
Oh, that is so sick, Ellison.

937
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:20,662
And you let our little girl play back there?

938
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,038
Why shouldn't I?

939
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:24,750
Our son is having night terrors

940
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:27,050
and drawing pictures of this crime at school!

941
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:29,378
Our daughter just painted
a little dead girl on our wall!

942
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:30,676
-She's missing, okay?
-What?

943
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:32,094
She's missing, technically she's missing.

944
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:34,721
-They don't know what she...
-I don't want to hear about technicalities!

945
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:36,719
Do you understand
what you've done this time?

946
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,311
The kind of jeopardy
you've put your children in?

947
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:39,605
Your marriage?

948
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:42,104
Yes, I do!
I understand!

949
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:44,686
Is there anything you won't do
for your goddamn book?

950
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:48,735
Apparently not.

951
01:19:48,993 --> 01:19:50,358
I guess this is all worth it to you.

952
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:51,484
What's worth it?

953
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:52,739
Putting your family at risk.

954
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:54,324
Risk of what?
Of more paintings?

955
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:55,905
Don't! Your daughter...

956
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:57,657
My daughter has a father who loves her,

957
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:58,957
who is always around,

958
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,830
who encourages her to be herself.

959
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:02,912
All right, the worst thing
that has ever happened to her

960
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:04,459
is one time she moved into a house

961
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:05,836
where a family was killed.

962
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:07,291
She found out about the murders, all right,

963
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:09,047
so she felt sorry for the little girl.

964
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:11,508
So she painted a fucking picture!

965
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,507
That's what she does.
It's what she always has done.

966
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:16,718
So that's it.
That's all you have to say?

967
01:20:16,854 --> 01:20:18,470
What else do you want from me?

968
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:21,101
How about a home
where we feel safe, Ellison?

969
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,642
How about neighbors that
don't hate us in a town

970
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:27,946
where I can buy groceries
without getting strange looks?

971
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:30,940
How about a life that doesn't involve our kids

972
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:32,407
drawing and painting

973
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:34,823
the sick details of some horrific tragedy?

974
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:36,074
Or working out

975
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:37,913
their deep-seated anxieties by doing

976
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:39,203
bizarre shit in the middle of the night?

977
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:41,079
How about that?
Would that be okay?

978
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:42,292
I can give all that to you, I can!

979
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:43,411
Just when I finish the book!

980
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:44,787
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You keep saying that.

981
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:46,004
This book isn't for us!

982
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,126
-Yes, it is.
-It's for you.

983
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:48,249
-Tracy, don't say that...
-Only you!

984
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:49,341
...don't say that, that's not true.

985
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:51,669
It is true! There are plenty
of other ways you can

986
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,596
-provide for this family.
-Doing what?

987
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:58,051
Teaching?
Editing journalism textbooks?

988
01:20:58,145 --> 01:21:00,261
Don't you understand

989
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:04,315
that writing is what gives my life meaning?

990
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:07,981
It's...
These books are my legacy.

991
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:14,241
I have always supported you
doing what you love, Ellison.

992
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:17,612
But writing isn't the meaning of your life.

993
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:21,415
You and me, right here, this marriage,

994
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:23,584
that's the meaning of your life.

995
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:25,165
And your legacy,

996
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:27,296
that's Ashley and Trevor.

997
01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:30,257
Your kids are your legacy.

998
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,306
Did I get Daddy in trouble?

999
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:46,516
No, sweetie.

1000
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:48,976
Your Daddy got Daddy in trouble.

1001
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:51,111
I'm sorry I painted on the wall.

1002
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:52,654
I know.

1003
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:54,986
You get a good night's sleep.

1004
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:05,417
...and here's the book I wrote

1005
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,336
- proving it, right?
- Exactly.

1006
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:09,960
Kidding aside,
would you want a family?

1007
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,586
Is that in the cards?

1008
01:22:11,677 --> 01:22:13,463
/ don't know,
if you asked me that a year ago,

1009
01:22:13,554 --> 01:22:15,044
I might have said, "No, never.

1010
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,012
"I'm a career man," but
you know how it goes.

1011
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:18,302
You meet someone,

1012
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:20,224
you get a little older.
All of a sudden,

1013
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:22,013
your career doesn't seem to matter so much.

1014
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:24,103
You want kids, you start to
see other people with kids.

1015
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:25,429
And you think,

1016
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:27,231
"I want that" and then you wonder,

1017
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:30,192
“Is he gonna look like me?
Is she gonna look like her?"

1018
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,528
You paint rooms in your head and you...

1019
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:45,040
Time for bed.

1020
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:57,790
What is happening?

1021
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:25,252
Shit.

1022
01:26:29,393 --> 01:26:30,383
Shit.

1023
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:25,567
What the hell are you doing?

1024
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:27,193
We have to leave here.

1025
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:30,109
What's the matter, what's happened?

1026
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:31,948
You were right.

1027
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,075
I made a mistake.

1028
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,033
We should have never come to this house.

1029
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:39,785
We have to leave now.

1030
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:41,833
Ell, you're freaking me out here.

1031
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:45,799
Get the kids, pack the car, we have to leave.

1032
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,335
Go!

1033
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:35,970
Honey, slow down.

1034
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:37,551
I just want to get on the highway.

1035
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:40,137
I want to put as much road
between us and this town

1036
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,269
-as we can, okay?
-Okay.

1037
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:44,141
Where are we going, Daddy?

1038
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:45,567
We're going home, honey.

1039
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:47,144
Home-home, like you promised?

1040
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:48,229
Yeah.

1041
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:50,655
Home, like I promised.

1042
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:52,237
What about our stuff?

1043
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,362
Well, we're gonna call the movers

1044
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:54,909
in the morning, all right?

1045
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,340
It's okay.

1046
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:24,806
Evening, Oswalts.

1047
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:25,936
Sheriff.

1048
01:29:26,987 --> 01:29:28,443
License and registration.

1049
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:30,103
Oh, God.

1050
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:35,530
Driving pretty fast for this time of night,

1051
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:36,951
don't you think?

1052
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:39,705
Anything I ought to know about?

1053
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,909
Just trying to take your advice, that's all.

1054
01:29:43,003 --> 01:29:44,994
Ha! Which advice would that be?

1055
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:47,170
Leave town and never look back.

1056
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,050
You weren't bullied away
or anything, were you?

1057
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:58,883
-I'm sorry?
-What I mean is,

1058
01:29:58,977 --> 01:30:00,513
I don't want to be reading in your book

1059
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:03,728
that angry town folks chased you out of here.

1060
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:06,523
If you've been mistreated,
I want to know about it.

1061
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:08,809
There isn't going to be any book.

1062
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:11,611
No book?

1063
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:12,813
No, sir.

1064
01:30:17,913 --> 01:30:19,244
Well, then...

1065
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:23,700
I don't see any reason
for me to have your autograph.

1066
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:25,667
Just one more favor.

1067
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:28,830
Hold it under 60
till you cross the county line.

1068
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:31,415
Until you're somebody else's problem.

1069
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:34,714
Yes, sir.

1070
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:36,800
Did you mean that?

1071
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:40,515
About the book? Yeah.

1072
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:42,847
You promise?

1073
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:46,017
I promise.

1074
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:51,189
Let's go home.

1075
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:10,166
Oh, yeah,
this goes in the office,

1076
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:11,462
right in there on the right.

1077
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:16,759
Hey, Ell, 10 bucks says

1078
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:18,378
Trevor sleeps through the night.

1079
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,259
No, I'm not taking that bet.

1080
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:14,438
Mr. Oswalt, sorry it took
So long to get back to you.

1081
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:16,528
There's been so little written on Bughuul

1082
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:17,695
that no one has actually

1083
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:20,240
bothered to scan any of this material before.

1084
01:32:20,326 --> 01:32:21,782
Well, what am I looking at?

1085
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:23,284
You're looking at an engraving,

1086
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:24,869
an old sketch from the Dark Ages

1087
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:27,618
and fragments of a deteriorated fresco.

1088
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:29,036
There just isn't a lot left.

1089
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:30,162
Everything else has been destroyed.

1090
01:32:30,587 --> 01:32:31,952
-Why?
-Well, superstition.

1091
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:34,955
Early Christians
believed that Bughuul actually

1092
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:37,500
lived in the images themselves
and that they were

1093
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:39,922
gateways into his realm.

1094
01:32:40,472 --> 01:32:41,962
-Gateways?
-Yes.

1095
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:43,213
The ancient church believed

1096
01:32:43,308 --> 01:32:44,673
that he would take possession of

1097
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:46,140
those who saw the images

1098
01:32:46,269 --> 01:32:49,182
and cause them to do terrible things.

1099
01:32:49,314 --> 01:32:51,851
Or in some cases
he can even abduct the viewer

1100
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:53,644
into the images themselves.

1101
01:32:53,777 --> 01:32:57,441
Children exposed to the images
were especially vulnerable

1102
01:32:57,530 --> 01:33:01,273
to Bughuul's possession and/or abduction.

1103
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:03,074
What if you destroyed them?

1104
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:04,651
Sorry, I don't follow.

1105
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:07,070
If you destroyed the images with a fire,

1106
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:08,496
what would happen then?

1107
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,666
What? Do you mean literally
or in the stories?

1108
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:15,288
In the stories,
if an image was destroyed, then

1109
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:17,088
the gateway would be closed and

1110
01:33:17,175 --> 01:33:20,167
Bughuul would no longer have
access to this world, right?

1111
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:25,844
Mr. Oswalt, what kind of book
are you writing exactly?

1112
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:32,558
I don't know. I'm not even
sure I have a book anymore.

1113
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:34,472
But thank you for your time.

1114
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:35,648
Anytime.

1115
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:30,422
All right.

1116
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,365
You know what time it is?

1117
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:50,529
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry,

1118
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:52,118
but I've been trying to call you all day.

1119
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:53,323
Mmm-hmm.
What's the problem?

1120
01:35:53,456 --> 01:35:55,288
Okay, the problem is that you moved.

1121
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:57,157
How is that a problem?

1122
01:35:57,335 --> 01:35:58,575
I was compiling all of the data

1123
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,081
that you've had me collecting and

1124
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:01,661
once I started putting it together

1125
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:02,913
into a nice readable package,

1126
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:04,497
I saw the connection.
It was obvious.

1127
01:36:04,634 --> 01:36:05,749
What was it?

1128
01:36:05,843 --> 01:36:07,504
The dates, the addresses,

1129
01:36:07,637 --> 01:36:09,344
each family that you had me look up

1130
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:11,088
had previously lived in the house

1131
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:13,298
where one of the earlier murders took place.

1132
01:36:13,977 --> 01:36:16,093
Each family?
All five of them?

1133
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:17,222
Yes!

1134
01:36:17,313 --> 01:36:19,896
And when you put them
in chronological order,

1135
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:21,606
you can actually draw a line

1136
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:23,275
from murder to murder to murder.

1137
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:24,442
Okay, we knew that

1138
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:25,940
the Stevensons previously lived in

1139
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:27,020
the same St. Louis house

1140
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:28,112
where the Millers had their throats cut.

1141
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:29,234
Right.

1142
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:30,732
But before the Miller family was killed,

1143
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:33,030
the Millers lived
in the same house in Orange County,

1144
01:36:33,162 --> 01:36:35,199
where the De Luzio Lawn Massacre occurred.

1145
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:36,871
Guess where the De Luzios lived

1146
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,536
before they moved to Orange County?

1147
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:40,708
Sacramento, where the Martinez family

1148
01:36:40,837 --> 01:36:42,077
was burned in their garage?

1149
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:44,295
Exactly.
The pattern goes back

1150
01:36:44,382 --> 01:36:46,248
to the 1966 Oregon drownings...

1151
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:48,091
Listen, Mr. Oswalt, you just moved out

1152
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:49,425
of the last house in line.

1153
01:36:49,554 --> 01:36:51,340
If this guy is still out there,

1154
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:53,342
you not only just sped up his timeline,

1155
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:54,889
you put yourself in it.

1156
01:36:56,686 --> 01:36:57,847
Thanks, Deputy.

1157
01:37:40,063 --> 01:37:41,224
Stephanie.

1158
01:38:01,793 --> 01:38:03,124
It's the missing kids.

1159
01:39:26,836 --> 01:39:29,203
I like that you made the movies longer.

1160
01:39:29,338 --> 01:39:30,874
They're better this way.

1161
01:40:18,221 --> 01:40:21,589
Don't worry, Daddy,
I'll make you famous again.
