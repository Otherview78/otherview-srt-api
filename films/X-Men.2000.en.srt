1
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:29,531
<i>Mutation: it is the key to our evolution.</i>

2
00:00:29,698 --> 00:00:35,412
<i>It has enabled us to evolve
into the dominant species on the planet.</i>

3
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:40,083
<i>This process normally takes
thousands and thousands of years.</i>

4
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,671
<i>But every few hundred millennia,
evolution leaps forward.</i>

5
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,187
Niagara Falls,

6
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:32,524
up the Canadian Rockies,

7
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,652
and then it's only
a few hundred miles to Anchorage.

8
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,615
- Won't it kinda be cold?
- Well, that's the point, stupid.

9
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:43,785
Otherwise it wouldn't be an adventure.

10
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:46,746
And when are you gonna do this?

11
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:51,542
I don't know.

12
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:55,046
After high school. Before college.

13
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,426
- Marie!
- I don't know what happened.

14
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:45,471
- David?
- I don't know... I just touched him.

15
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:48,558
- I didn't mean...
- Call an ambulance!

16
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:51,602
We only touched. Just get away from me!

17
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:55,106
- Will you call an ambulance?!
- Don't touch me!

18
00:05:56,232 --> 00:06:02,113
We are now seeing the beginnings
of another stage of human evolution.

19
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,785
These mutations manifest at puberty, often
triggered by periods of emotional stress.

20
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:11,247
Thank you, Miss Grey.
It was quite educational.

21
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:15,710
However, it fails to address the issue
that is the focus of this hearing.

22
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:19,589
Three words: are mutants dangerous?

23
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:25,470
That's unfair, Senator Kelly. The wrong
person driving a car can be dangerous.

24
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:29,265
- We do license people to drive.
- Yes, but not to live.

25
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:35,146
Senator, mutants who've come forward
and revealed themselves publicly

26
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:38,817
have been met with fear,
hostility, even violence.

27
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:41,444
It is because of that hostility

28
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:45,782
that I am urging the Senate
to vote against mutant registration.

29
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:49,285
- To force mutants to expose themselves...
- Expose themselves?

30
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:54,123
What do mutants have to hide that makes
them so afraid to identify themselves?

31
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,461
- I didn't say they were hiding.
- Let me show you what is being hidden.

32
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:01,756
I have here a list of names
of identified mutants...

33
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:04,342
...living right here in the United States.

34
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:08,263
- Senator Kelly...
- A girl in Illinois who walks through walls.

35
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:12,975
What's to stop her from walking
into a bank vault? Or into the White House?

36
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:18,481
Or into <i>their</i> houses? And there are even
rumours of mutants so powerful

37
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:21,776
that they can enter our minds
and control our thoughts,

38
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:24,362
taking away our God-given free will.

39
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:29,200
The American people deserve the right
to decide whether they want their children

40
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:33,371
to be in school with mutants.
To be taught by mutants.

41
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:40,420
Ladies and gentlemen,
the truth is that mutants are very real.

42
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:46,217
And they are among us.
We must know who they are,

43
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:50,388
and, above all,
we must know what they can do.

44
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,288
Eric.

45
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,668
What are you doing here?

46
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:25,048
Why do you ask questions to which
you already know the answers?

47
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:29,510
- Don't give up on them, Eric.
- What would you have me do, Charles?

48
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:33,055
I've heard these arguments before.

49
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:37,351
It was a long time ago.
Mankind has evolved since then.

50
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:41,064
Yes... into us.

51
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,159
Are you sneaking around in here, Charles?
Whatever are you looking for?

52
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,459
I'm looking for hope.

53
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:08,882
I will bring you hope, old friend.
And I ask only one thing in return.

54
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:13,430
Don't get in my way.

55
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:21,312
We are the future, Charles, not them!
They no longer matter.

56
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,578
This is it.

57
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:49,841
Where are we? I thought you said you were
gonna take me as far as Laughlin City.

58
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,092
This <i>is</i> Laughlin City.

59
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:28,337
Gentlemen, in all my years
I've never seen anything like this.

60
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:34,510
Are you gonna let this man
walk away with your money?

61
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:35,970
No!

62
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,890
I'll fight him!

63
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:43,352
Ladies and gentlemen,

64
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,479
our saviour!

65
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:49,150
Don't hit him in the balls.

66
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:53,738
- You said anything goes.
- Anything goes, but he'll take it personal.

67
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,376
You idiot!

68
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:26,103
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight's winner and still King of the Cage,

69
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,647
the Wolverine.

70
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:02,556
You want something new, honey?
Or are you sticking with water?

71
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:13,609
I'll have a beer.

72
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:27,332
<i>Ellis Island, once the arrival point
for American immigrants,</i>

73
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,583
<i>is opening its doors again.</i>

74
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,796
<i>Preparations are nearly completed
for the United Nations World Summit.</i>

75
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:40,678
<i>The event promises to be the largest
single gathering of world leaders in history.</i>

76
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:46,267
<i>Leaders will discuss issues ranging from
the world's economy and weapons treaties,</i>

77
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:50,855
<i>to the mutant phenomenon
and its impact on our world stage.</i>

78
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,691
<i>American legislators contend
that debate over mutant issues</i>

79
00:12:54,859 --> 00:13:00,281
<i>should be the primary focus of what is,
on the surface at least, a diplomatic affair.</i>

80
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:04,369
- You owe me some money.
- Stu, let's not do this.

81
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:08,330
No man takes a beating like that
without a mark to show for it.

82
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:11,834
- Come on, this isn't worth it.
- I know what you are.

83
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:16,881
You lost your money.
You keep this up, you lose something else.

84
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,508
Look out!

85
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:34,399
Get outta my bar, freak!

86
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:27,637
- What the hell are you doin'?
- I'm sorry. I needed a ride.

87
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:31,307
- I thought you might help me.
- Get out!

88
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,351
- Where am I supposed to go?
- I don't know.

89
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:37,771
- You don't know or you don't care?
- Pick one.

90
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,736
- I saved your life!
- No, you didn't.

91
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:02,129
You don't have anything to eat, do you?

92
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:25,694
I'm Rogue.

93
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:35,079
Were you in the army?
Doesn't that mean you were in the army?

94
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,256
- Wow!
- What?

95
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,845
- Suddenly <i>my</i> life isn't bad.
- If you prefer the road...

96
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,348
No! It looks great.

97
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:00,146
It looks cosy.

98
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:09,947
Put your hands on the heater.

99
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:14,368
- I'm not gonna hurt you, kid.
- It's nothing personal.

100
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:17,871
It's just when people touch my skin,
something happens.

101
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,790
What?

102
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,626
I don't know. They just get hurt.

103
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,214
Fair enough.

104
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:33,303
When they come out, does it hurt?

105
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:39,018
Every time.

106
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:45,065
So what kind of a name is Rogue?

107
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:49,611
I don't know.
What kind of a name is Wolverine?

108
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,952
My name's Logan.

109
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,622
Marie.

110
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,795
- You should wear your seat belt.
- Look, kid, I don't need advice on...

111
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,405
You all right?

112
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,700
- Kid, are you all right?
- I'm stuck!

113
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,517
Weren't you supposed to bring
someone back with you?

114
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,157
- What happened?
- They knew.

115
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,917
Charles...

116
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:49,393
- Where is the mutant now?
- With them.

117
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:56,566
I have made the first move.
That is all they know.

118
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:02,531
Come, the UN summit is approaching.
Time for our little test.

119
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,980
Where's he going?

120
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,717
Where are you going?

121
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,766
Over here!

122
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:22,504
- Where are you going?
- This way!

123
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:24,715
He's over there.

124
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:33,348
Let go! What's your hurry?

125
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,563
Over here!

126
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,250
Good morning, Logan.

127
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:05,213
So, I'd like your definitions of weak and
strong anthropic principles on Wednesday.

128
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,424
That'll be all.

129
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,266
- Bye, Professor.
- Bye, Kitty.

130
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,855
Physics.

131
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:26,401
I'm Charles Xavier.
Would you like some breakfast?

132
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:29,279
- Where am I?
- Westchester, New York.

133
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,201
You were attacked. My people
brought you here for medical attention.

134
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:38,496
- I don't need medical attention.
- Yes, of course.

135
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,584
- Where's the girl?
- Rogue's here. She's fine.

136
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,962
Really?

137
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:51,301
Ah. Logan, I'd like you to meet
Ororo Monroe, also called Storm.

138
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:54,554
This is Scott Summers, also called Cyclops.

139
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:00,060
They saved your life.

140
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:04,898
I believe you've already met Dr Jean Grey.

141
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:10,153
You're in my school for the gifted. For
mutants. You'll be safe here from Magneto.

142
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,406
- What's a magneto?
- A very powerful mutant,

143
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:17,243
who believes a war is brewing
between mutants and the rest of humanity.

144
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,121
I've been following his activities
for some time.

145
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,833
The man who attacked you
is an associate of his called Sabretooth.

146
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,710
Sabretooth?

147
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,423
Storm.

148
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,260
What do they call you? Wheels?

149
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:38,348
This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

150
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:42,519
And Cyclops, right?

151
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:45,146
You wanna get outta my way?

152
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:49,485
Logan, it's been almost 15 years, hasn't it?

153
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:53,447
Living from day to day,
moving from place to place,

154
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:56,366
with no memory of who or what you are.

155
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,869
Shut up!

156
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:04,124
Give me a chance. I may be able
to help you find some answers.

157
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,837
- How do you know?
- You're not the only one with gifts.

158
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:11,298
- Where are you going?
- Where's he going?

159
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,424
Over here!

160
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:19,389
What is this place?

161
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,145
Anonymity is a mutant's first defence
against the world's hostility.

162
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,357
Hey, no powers!

163
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:33,570
To the public, we're merely
a school for gifted youngsters.

164
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:37,574
Cyclops, Storm and Jean
were some of my first students.

165
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:41,536
I protected them,
taught them to control their powers

166
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:45,290
and, in time, teach others to do the same.

167
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:49,795
The students are mostly runaways -
frightened, alone.

168
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:54,883
Some with gifts so extreme they're a danger
to themselves and those around them.

169
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,718
Like your friend Rogue.

170
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:01,598
Incapable of physical human contact,
probably for the rest of her life.

171
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:06,895
And yet here she is with others
her own age, learning, being accepted,

172
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:09,106
not feared.

173
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:22,035
- John!
- Sorry.

174
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:28,458
I'm Bobby.

175
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,877
- What's your name?
- Rogue.

176
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:33,880
- What'll happen to her?
- That's up to her.

177
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:38,051
Rejoin the world as an educated
young woman, or stay on to teach others.

178
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:41,972
To become what the children
have affectionately called "X-Men".

179
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,432
Welcome to Mutant High.

180
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,646
But the school is merely our public face.

181
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:54,443
The lower levels, however,
are an entirely different matter.

182
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:02,492
When I was a boy I discovered I had
the power to control people's minds.

183
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:05,286
Make them think or do whatever I wanted.

184
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:09,499
When I was 17
I met a young man named Eric Lensherr.

185
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:15,422
He, too, had an unusual power. He could
create magnetic fields and control metal.

186
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:21,594
Believing that humanity would never
accept us, he grew angry and vengeful.

187
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:25,807
He became Magneto.

188
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:30,353
There are mutants out there
with incredible powers, Logan.

189
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,898
And many who do not share
my respect for mankind.

190
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:38,194
If no one is equipped to oppose them,
humanity's days could be over.

191
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:40,530
I'll make a deal with you.

192
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:44,701
Give me 48 hours to find out
what Magneto wants with you,

193
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:47,704
and I give you my word
that I will use all my power

194
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:53,085
to help you piece together what you've lost,
and what you're looking for.

195
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,867
Senator, you favour gun registration, yes?
Some of these so-called children

196
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:30,914
possess more than 10 times
the destructive force of any handgun.

197
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,251
No, I don't see a difference.
All I see are weapons in our schools.

198
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:38,254
Well, that's fair enough. All right.

199
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,256
So?

200
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:43,968
It's gonna be close.
A vote this loaded is always close.

201
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:47,263
What about the UN summit?
The world will be watching.

202
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:51,768
- Maybe you could use it to your advantage.
- We're Americans, Henry.

203
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:55,564
Let the rest of the damn world
deal with mutants in their own way.

204
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,900
You know this situation? These mutants?

205
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:05,615
People like this Jean Grey?
If it were up to me, I'd lock 'em all away.

206
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,452
It's a war.

207
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:12,747
It's the reason people like me exist.

208
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:22,340
Where the hell are we?

209
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:34,227
Pilot!

210
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:41,776
People like you are the reason
I was afraid to go to school as a child.

211
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:15,184
I'm sorry.

212
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:19,063
- For what?
- If I hurt you.

213
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:32,535
So... couldn't wait
to get my shirt off again, huh?

214
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:52,097
The metal is an alloy called adamantium.

215
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:57,894
Supposedly indestructible. It's been
surgically grafted to his entire skeleton.

216
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:01,230
How could he have survived
a procedure like that?

217
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:05,693
His mutation. He has
uncharted regenerative capability

218
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,654
which enables him to heal rapidly.

219
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:12,199
This also makes his age
impossible to determine.

220
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:16,121
He could very well be older than you,
Professor.

221
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:19,082
- Who did this to him?
- He doesn't know.

222
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:22,627
Nor does he remember anything
about his life before it happened.

223
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:27,382
Experimentation on mutants.
It's not unheard of.

224
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:31,219
But I've never seen anything
like this before.

225
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,763
What do you think Magneto want with him?

226
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:37,559
I'm not entirely sure it's him
Magneto wants.

227
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:05,170
Toad has a wicked tongue, Senator.

228
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:07,380
Just like you.

229
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:15,930
Who are you people? Where's Henry?

230
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:19,809
Mr Guyrich has been dead
for some time, Senator.

231
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:24,689
But I've had Mystique here keep you
company. She takes so many shapes.

232
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:28,151
Whatever you do to me,
you'll make me right.

233
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:32,113
Every word I've spoken will be confirmed.

234
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:40,413
Are you a God-fearing man, Senator?
It's such a strange phrase.

235
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,499
I've always thought of God as a teacher.

236
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:47,253
As a bringer of light,
wisdom and understanding.

237
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:51,591
You see,
I think what you really are afraid of is me.

238
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:55,928
Me and my kind.
The brotherhood of mutants.

239
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:05,396
It's not so surprising, really. Mankind has
always feared what it doesn't understand.

240
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:12,361
Well, don't fear God, Senator,
and certainly don't fear me.

241
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,156
Not any more.

242
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:22,788
- What do you intend to do to me?
- Let's just say God works too slowly.

243
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:40,950
I think you'll be comfortable here.

244
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:45,038
- Where's your room?
- With Scott, down the hall.

245
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,125
Is that your gift? Putting up with that guy?

246
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:52,962
Actually I'm telekinetic.
I can move things with my mind.

247
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:56,173
Really? What kinds of things?

248
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:59,052
All kinds of things.

249
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:03,431
- I also have telepathic ability.
- Like your professor?

250
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:08,603
Nowhere near that powerful.
But he's teaching me to develop it.

251
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:10,813
I'm sure he is.

252
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:14,650
- So read my mind.
- I'd rather not.

253
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:19,196
- Come on. You afraid you might like it?
- I doubt it.

254
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:43,805
What do you see?

255
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,764
Scott!

256
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:51,770
Good night, Logan.

257
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,448
You gonna tell me
to stay away from your girl?

258
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:05,534
If I had to do that, she wouldn't be my girl.

259
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:09,830
Then I guess you've got nothing
to worry about, do you... Cyclops?

260
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:14,209
It must just burn you up
that a boy like me saved your life, huh?

261
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:18,006
You oughta be careful.
I might not be there next time.

262
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:21,759
Oh, and Logan, stay away from my girl.

263
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:58,796
Logan?

264
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:10,683
Logan! Logan, wake up.

265
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:46,844
Help me!

266
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:51,766
Somebody, help!

267
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:24,715
Scott, grab a pillow.

268
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:29,721
It was an accident.

269
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:42,191
- Logan?
- What happened?

270
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:46,904
- Is she all right?
- She'll be all right.

271
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,367
- What did she do to me?
- When Rogue touches someone,

272
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:54,287
she takes their energy, their life force.

273
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:57,832
In the case of mutants,
she absorbs their gifts for a while.

274
00:40:57,998 --> 00:41:00,417
In your case, your ability to heal.

275
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,130
It felt like she almost killed me.

276
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:09,635
If she'd held out any longer,
she could have.

277
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:07,193
How are we feeling, Senator?
Advanced, I hope.

278
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,921
What the hell have you done to me?

279
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:31,091
Senator, this is pointless.
Where would you go?

280
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:33,636
Who would take you in,
now you're one of us?

281
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:34,822
Tommy, let it go! Tommy, please let it go!

282
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:37,742
I'm telling Mommy.

283
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:53,841
Is that a mutant?

284
00:43:59,138 --> 00:44:03,392
<i>...UN summit. With the leaders
of over 200 nations attending,</i>

285
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:07,980
<i>the Secret Service has transformed
Ellis Island into a veritable Fort Knox</i>

286
00:44:08,147 --> 00:44:13,736
<i>for tomorrow night's opening gala.
Ellis Island rests less than one mile from...</i>

287
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:17,406
Rogue!

288
00:44:17,573 --> 00:44:19,658
Bobby!

289
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:25,039
Rogue, what did you do? They say
you're stealing other mutants' powers.

290
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:27,207
No! I borrowed his power.

291
00:44:27,374 --> 00:44:31,170
You never use your power
against another mutant.

292
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:34,256
I had no choice.

293
00:44:34,423 --> 00:44:39,803
- No, you have to understand...
- If I were you I'd get myself outta here.

294
00:44:41,555 --> 00:44:45,726
- What do you mean?
- Listen, the students are freaked.

295
00:44:45,893 --> 00:44:50,648
Professor Xavier's furious.
I don't know what he'll do with you.

296
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:55,819
I think it'll be easier on your own.

297
00:45:01,909 --> 00:45:03,994
You should go.

298
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:30,396
What are you looking for, Eric? It's strange.

299
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:35,442
There are more <i>powerful</i> mutants out there.
Why should this one be so important to him?

300
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:39,154
- Maybe it's his way with people.
- You don't like him.

301
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:42,908
- How could you tell?
- Well, I am psychic, you know.

302
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,287
- Where is she?
- Who?

303
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:48,789
Rogue.

304
00:45:48,956 --> 00:45:50,332
She's gone.

305
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:57,381
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

306
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:02,552
Welcome to Cerebro.

307
00:46:08,267 --> 00:46:10,811
This certainly is a big, round room.

308
00:46:10,978 --> 00:46:14,314
The brain waves of mutants
are different from average humans.

309
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:19,653
This device amplifies my power, allowing me
to locate mutants across great distances.

310
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:24,408
- That's how I intend to find Rogue.
- Why don't you just use it to find Magneto?

311
00:46:24,575 --> 00:46:29,121
I've been trying, but he's found
some way to shield himself from it.

312
00:46:29,288 --> 00:46:32,374
How would he know how to do that?

313
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:34,918
Because he helped me build it.

314
00:46:35,085 --> 00:46:37,337
Now if you'll excuse me...

315
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:52,728
Have you ever...?

316
00:46:52,895 --> 00:46:54,939
Used Cerebro?

317
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:57,149
No.

318
00:46:57,316 --> 00:47:02,571
It takes a degree of control and...
for someone like me, it's...

319
00:47:02,738 --> 00:47:04,240
Dangerous.

320
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,946
<i>...now boarding at track 4.</i>

321
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:50,869
- She's at the station.
- Where is it?

322
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:54,665
A few miles west of here.
You can't leave the mansion.

323
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:56,541
It's the opportunity Magneto needs.

324
00:47:56,708 --> 00:48:00,378
- Listen, I'm the reason she took off.
- We had a deal.

325
00:48:00,546 --> 00:48:03,298
She's all right. She's just upset.

326
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:07,844
Storm, Cyclops, find her.
See if you can talk to her.

327
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:19,231
- What?
- Where's my motorcycle?

328
00:48:56,393 --> 00:48:58,145
Hey, kid.

329
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:15,704
I'm sorry about last night.

330
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:19,374
Me, too.

331
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:22,252
You running again?

332
00:49:23,754 --> 00:49:26,298
I heard the professor was mad at me.

333
00:49:26,465 --> 00:49:29,843
- Who told you that?
- A boy at school.

334
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:35,307
- When's the last time you saw her?
- She was supposed to meet me for lunch.

335
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:42,856
You look around,
I'll check with the ticket agent.

336
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:58,330
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

337
00:50:22,479 --> 00:50:28,110
- You think I should go back.
- I think you should follow your instincts.

338
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:38,370
The first boy I ever kissed
ended up in a coma for three weeks.

339
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:43,625
I can still feel him inside my head.

340
00:50:45,127 --> 00:50:48,380
And it's the same with you.

341
00:51:15,407 --> 00:51:19,411
There's not many people that'll understand
what you're going through.

342
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:22,748
But I think this guy Xavier's one of them.

343
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:27,461
He seems to genuinely wanna help you.

344
00:51:27,627 --> 00:51:30,088
And that's a rare thing.

345
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:34,635
For people like us.

346
00:51:43,894 --> 00:51:46,021
OK, so...

347
00:51:46,188 --> 00:51:50,400
What do you say?
Give these geeks one more shot?

348
00:51:52,402 --> 00:51:54,905
Come on, I'll take care of you.

349
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:59,576
- You promise?
- Yeah.

350
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:02,704
Yeah, I promise.

351
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:16,718
Come along now. I told you not to...

352
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,848
She's about 17, my height,

353
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:25,352
has brown hair and she...

354
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:36,112
Scream for me.

355
00:53:19,781 --> 00:53:22,575
Quit playing around.

356
00:54:04,117 --> 00:54:06,328
You must be Wolverine.

357
00:54:08,204 --> 00:54:13,251
That remarkable metal doesn't run through
your entire body, does it?

358
00:54:23,595 --> 00:54:25,347
Stop!

359
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:27,348
Stop it!

360
00:54:28,058 --> 00:54:32,604
- What the hell do you want with me?
- You? My dear boy!

361
00:54:32,771 --> 00:54:35,440
Whoever said I wanted <i>you?</i>

362
00:54:56,753 --> 00:54:58,088
Young people!

363
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:12,560
<i>All right, hold it! Hold it right there.</i>

364
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:17,106
<i>Stay where you are.
Put your hands over your heads. Now!</i>

365
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:51,182
You Homo sapiens and your guns.

366
00:55:55,103 --> 00:55:58,315
- That's enough, Eric.
- Let them go.

367
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:06,865
Why not come out where I can see you,
Charles?

368
00:56:09,826 --> 00:56:12,120
What do you want her for?

369
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:15,207
Can't you read my mind?

370
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:19,545
What now? Save the girl?

371
00:56:20,462 --> 00:56:24,508
You'll have to kill me, Charles.
And what will that accomplish?

372
00:56:24,674 --> 00:56:29,637
Let them pass that law and they'll have you
in chains with a number on your forehead.

373
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:33,391
- It won't be that way.
- Then kill me and find out.

374
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:39,147
No? Then release me.

375
00:56:47,864 --> 00:56:50,158
Fine!

376
00:57:02,754 --> 00:57:05,215
Care to press your luck, Charles?

377
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:11,638
I don't think I can stop them all.

378
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:32,492
Still unwilling to make sacrifices.
That's what makes you weak.

379
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:46,798
Goodbye, Charles.

380
00:58:17,287 --> 00:58:20,248
- You said he wanted <i>me.</i>
- I made a terrible mistake.

381
00:58:20,415 --> 00:58:25,253
His helmet was somehow designed
to block my telepathy.

382
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:28,840
Couldn't see what he was after
till it was too late.

383
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:31,050
- Where are you going?
- To find her.

384
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:34,262
- How?
- The traditional way: look.

385
00:58:38,141 --> 00:58:41,353
- Logan, you can't do this alone.
- Who'll help me? You?

386
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:45,273
- So far, you've all done a bang-up job.
- Then help us. Fight <i>with</i> us.

387
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,276
Fight with you? Join the team?
Be an X-Man?

388
00:58:48,443 --> 00:58:51,196
Who the hell do you think you are?
You're a mutant.

389
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:54,156
The world is full of people
that hate and fear you

390
00:58:54,324 --> 00:58:59,246
and you're wasting your time trying
to protect them. I got better things to do.

391
00:58:59,412 --> 00:59:02,916
You know, Magneto's right.
There's a war coming.

392
00:59:03,082 --> 00:59:06,920
- Are you sure you're on the right side?
- At least I've chosen a side.

393
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:17,263
I'm looking for Dr Jean Grey.

394
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:29,317
Senator Kelly.

395
00:59:30,151 --> 00:59:32,862
I'm Professor Charles Xavier.

396
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:37,826
I was afraid if I went to hospital,
they would...

397
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:39,994
Treat you like a mutant?

398
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:46,000
We're not what you think. Not all of us.

399
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:49,879
Tell it to the ones who did this to me.

400
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,385
Senator...

401
01:00:01,057 --> 01:00:03,559
I want you to try and relax.

402
01:00:07,689 --> 01:00:10,191
I'm not going to hurt you.

403
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:03,744
Welcome to the future.

404
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:07,164
Brother.

405
01:01:12,879 --> 01:01:16,924
The machine emits radiation that triggers
mutation in ordinary human beings.

406
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:21,095
But the mutation is unnatural.
Kelly's body is rejecting it.

407
01:01:21,262 --> 01:01:25,683
- His cells began to break down immediately.
- What effect does it have on mutants?

408
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:31,189
There appears to be none. But I fear it will
harm any normal person exposed to it.

409
01:01:31,356 --> 01:01:35,110
- So what does Magneto want with Rogue?
- I don't know.

410
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:43,117
Wait a second. You said this machine
draws its power from Magneto.

411
01:01:43,284 --> 01:01:48,831
- And that it weakened him.
- Yes. In fact, it nearly killed him.

412
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:54,837
He's going to transfer his power to Rogue
and use her to power the machine.

413
01:01:58,007 --> 01:02:00,092
Is somebody there?

414
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:04,471
Yes. I'm here.

415
01:02:06,474 --> 01:02:08,768
Please don't leave me!

416
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:13,856
I don't want to be alone.

417
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:16,942
All right.

418
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,663
Do you hate normal people?

419
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:32,833
Sometimes.

420
01:02:33,668 --> 01:02:35,753
Why?

421
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:41,550
I suppose...

422
01:02:42,677 --> 01:02:45,180
I'm afraid of them.

423
01:02:47,223 --> 01:02:49,475
Well...

424
01:02:49,642 --> 01:02:55,356
I think you've got one less person...
to be afraid of.

425
01:03:18,171 --> 01:03:22,926
Cyclops, you and Storm ready the jet.
I'm gonna find Rogue. Get Logan a uniform.

426
01:03:23,092 --> 01:03:26,012
Wait a minute.
He's not coming with us, is he?

427
01:03:26,179 --> 01:03:29,724
- Yes.
- Sorry, but he'll endanger the mission and...

428
01:03:29,891 --> 01:03:32,935
I wasn't the one who gave the station
a new sunroof, pal.

429
01:03:33,102 --> 01:03:35,897
No, you were the one
who stabbed Rogue in the chest.

430
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:39,149
Why don't you take your little mission
and stick it up...

431
01:03:39,317 --> 01:03:41,694
Senator Kelly is dead.

432
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:45,531
I'm going to find her.

433
01:03:48,534 --> 01:03:49,535
Settle this.

434
01:04:27,323 --> 01:04:29,408
I'm sorry.

435
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:56,602
You can still hear me... can't you?

436
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:09,323
You've taught me everything in my life
that was ever worth knowing.

437
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,993
And if anything happens...

438
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:16,206
I'll take care of them.

439
01:05:30,261 --> 01:05:31,637
Jean?

440
01:05:35,182 --> 01:05:37,434
Jean!

441
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:39,813
No!

442
01:05:52,617 --> 01:05:54,369
Jean?

443
01:05:54,535 --> 01:05:56,579
Jean.

444
01:05:56,746 --> 01:05:58,790
Answer me. Please.

445
01:06:00,124 --> 01:06:02,251
I know where Magneto's going.

446
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:24,166
Magnificent, isn't she?

447
01:07:25,418 --> 01:07:29,339
- I've seen it.
- I first saw her in 1949.

448
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:35,761
America was going to be
the land of tolerance. Of peace.

449
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:43,353
Are you going to kill me?

450
01:07:47,857 --> 01:07:49,650
Yes.

451
01:07:49,817 --> 01:07:53,738
- Why?
- Because there is no land of tolerance.

452
01:07:53,904 --> 01:07:57,699
There is no peace, not here
or anywhere else.

453
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,496
Whole families destroyed simply

454
01:08:01,662 --> 01:08:04,498
because they were born different
from those in power.

455
01:08:04,665 --> 01:08:09,795
Well, after tonight,
the world's powerful will be just like us.

456
01:08:09,962 --> 01:08:12,590
They will return home as brothers.

457
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:15,176
As mutants.

458
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:17,719
Our cause will be theirs.

459
01:08:18,804 --> 01:08:21,891
Your sacrifice will mean our survival.

460
01:08:25,728 --> 01:08:29,857
I'll understand
if that comes as small consolation.

461
01:08:32,735 --> 01:08:34,737
Put her in the machine.

462
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:38,615
I'll raise it.

463
01:08:39,784 --> 01:08:42,370
Magneto is here - Liberty Island.

464
01:08:42,536 --> 01:08:48,375
Presumably his objective is to mutate the
world leaders at the summit on Ellis Island.

465
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:52,755
He doesn't know his machine kills,
and judging from what the professor saw

466
01:08:52,922 --> 01:08:58,636
if Magneto gave Rogue enough power, he
could wipe out everyone in New York City.

467
01:08:58,803 --> 01:09:02,390
All right. We can insert here
at the George Washington Bridge.

468
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:04,975
Come around the bank,
just off of Manhattan,

469
01:09:05,142 --> 01:09:07,686
land on the far side of Liberty Island. Here.

470
01:09:07,853 --> 01:09:09,980
What about harbour patrol? Radar?

471
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:13,859
If they have anything that can pick up
<i>our</i> jet, they deserve to catch us.

472
01:09:28,499 --> 01:09:31,419
You actually go outside in these things?

473
01:09:31,585 --> 01:09:35,214
What would you prefer? Yellow spandex?

474
01:09:42,221 --> 01:09:43,222
Whoa.

475
01:10:24,972 --> 01:10:27,933
There's the bridge. I'm takin' her down.

476
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:36,901
Storm, some cover, please.

477
01:10:55,628 --> 01:10:59,632
Toad, Mystique, stay sharp.
We're not alone.

478
01:10:59,798 --> 01:11:02,718
And you stay here.
Once I've given my power to the girl,

479
01:11:02,885 --> 01:11:04,970
I'll be temporarily weakened.

480
01:11:05,137 --> 01:11:07,598
You'll be my only defence.

481
01:11:14,855 --> 01:11:16,648
Sounds like a storm's comin'.

482
01:11:31,747 --> 01:11:34,541
- Sorry.
- You call that a landing?

483
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:49,598
The torch.

484
01:11:56,313 --> 01:12:01,527
<i>...the proceedings. The first dignitaries
started to arrive about an hour ago,</i>

485
01:12:01,694 --> 01:12:05,573
<i>greeted with a garden-party atmosphere
designed to entertain them</i>

486
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:08,283
<i>as the others traversed the rigid security.</i>

487
01:12:33,851 --> 01:12:36,562
- There's someone here.
- Where?

488
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:40,440
- I don't know. Keep your eye open.
- Logan...

489
01:12:44,028 --> 01:12:45,988
Damn it!

490
01:12:51,994 --> 01:12:56,123
- Anything?
- There's someone here. I just can't see 'em.

491
01:13:09,011 --> 01:13:10,346
Wait!

492
01:13:17,436 --> 01:13:19,563
Back up! Back up!

493
01:14:36,431 --> 01:14:37,891
Jean!

494
01:14:39,434 --> 01:14:40,685
Oh, God!

495
01:15:40,662 --> 01:15:42,789
Don't move.

496
01:15:59,473 --> 01:16:02,100
Don't you people ever die?

497
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:39,846
Do you know what happens to a toad
when it's struck by lightning?

498
01:16:45,394 --> 01:16:48,522
The same thing
that happens to everything else.

499
01:17:03,328 --> 01:17:05,831
Logan, is that you?

500
01:17:17,134 --> 01:17:20,178
The other one ain't far away.

501
01:17:20,345 --> 01:17:24,641
- Come on. We have to regroup.
- I know, but there's a problem.

502
01:17:27,936 --> 01:17:30,480
You're not part of the group.

503
01:17:51,168 --> 01:17:53,671
Hey, hey! It's me.

504
01:17:53,837 --> 01:17:56,214
- Prove it.
- You're a dick.

505
01:17:57,507 --> 01:17:59,342
OK.

506
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,095
Hey!

507
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:24,618
- Everybody get out of here.
- What is it?

508
01:18:24,785 --> 01:18:26,829
I can't move.

509
01:18:46,515 --> 01:18:48,809
Ah, my brothers.

510
01:18:49,518 --> 01:18:55,441
Welcome. And you, just point those claws
of yours in a safer direction.

511
01:19:09,329 --> 01:19:11,540
You better close your eyes.

512
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:16,586
Storm, fry 'em.

513
01:19:16,753 --> 01:19:21,049
A bolt of lightning into
a huge copper conductor.

514
01:19:22,092 --> 01:19:24,010
I thought you lived at a school.

515
01:19:29,266 --> 01:19:33,395
For those of you not familiar
with the historical significance...

516
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:40,026
Mystique?

517
01:19:40,777 --> 01:19:44,531
- Mystique!
- I've seen Senator Kelly.

518
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:50,829
So, the good senator survived his fall.
And the swim to shore.

519
01:19:50,996 --> 01:19:53,540
He's become even more powerful
than I imagined.

520
01:19:53,707 --> 01:19:56,293
- He's dead.
- It's true.

521
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:00,506
I saw him die.
Like those people down there will die.

522
01:20:01,339 --> 01:20:04,217
Are you sure you saw what you saw?

523
01:20:04,384 --> 01:20:08,638
I would also like to thank the
President of the United States of America

524
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:14,436
for hosting this event under the lights
of the great city of New York.

525
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:25,822
Why do none of you understand
what I'm trying to do?

526
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:31,369
Those people down there control our fate
and the fate of every other mutant!

527
01:20:32,871 --> 01:20:35,082
Well...

528
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:37,751
soon our fate will be theirs.

529
01:20:37,918 --> 01:20:41,130
<i>Help! Please help me!</i>

530
01:20:41,963 --> 01:20:47,427
You're so full of shit. If you're really
so righteous, it'd be <i>you</i> in that thing.

531
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:53,058
Help! Somebody help me!

532
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:08,114
<i>Please!</i>

533
01:21:09,741 --> 01:21:11,785
<i>Somebody please help me!</i>

534
01:21:17,332 --> 01:21:20,794
Somebody! Help me...

535
01:21:31,972 --> 01:21:34,266
Logan!

536
01:22:29,696 --> 01:22:32,991
- I'm sorry, my dear.
- Don't do this.

537
01:22:45,503 --> 01:22:47,588
This is mine.

538
01:23:50,485 --> 01:23:52,570
You owe me a scream.

539
01:23:56,199 --> 01:23:59,911
Hey, bub, I'm not finished with you yet.

540
01:24:03,665 --> 01:24:06,292
- Jean.
- Scott, when I tell you, open your eyes.

541
01:24:06,459 --> 01:24:07,460
- No!
- Trust me.

542
01:24:07,627 --> 01:24:10,130
You drop something?

543
01:24:14,092 --> 01:24:16,136
Now!

544
01:24:30,275 --> 01:24:32,319
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

545
01:24:33,069 --> 01:24:37,574
- Gotta get her outta there. Can you hit it?
- The rings are moving too fast.

546
01:24:37,741 --> 01:24:40,493
- Shoot it!
- I'll kill her! Storm, can you get me up?

547
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:43,830
- I can't control it like that.
- Then let me go.

548
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:50,587
If I don't make it,
at least you can still blast the damn thing.

549
01:24:51,463 --> 01:24:55,467
All right, do it!
Jean, use your power. Try to steady him.

550
01:24:57,135 --> 01:24:59,095
Hang on to something.

551
01:25:53,691 --> 01:25:56,319
Scott, wait!

552
01:26:25,682 --> 01:26:28,017
- Jean, I have to!
- Just wait!

553
01:26:29,936 --> 01:26:32,439
I have a shot.

554
01:26:32,605 --> 01:26:34,440
I'm taking it.

555
01:27:14,731 --> 01:27:17,234
Come on...

556
01:28:47,532 --> 01:28:51,286
Hey, this one's alive.
Let's get him outta here.

557
01:29:17,186 --> 01:29:21,232
Welcome back. I knew you'd find your way.

558
01:29:21,399 --> 01:29:23,359
I had you to guide me.

559
01:29:26,529 --> 01:29:29,032
How did we do?

560
01:29:56,476 --> 01:29:59,145
Oh, that tickles.

561
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:01,397
Hey.

562
01:30:02,607 --> 01:30:04,275
Hey.

563
01:30:04,442 --> 01:30:06,444
How are you feeling?

564
01:30:06,611 --> 01:30:08,655
Fantastic.

565
01:30:09,864 --> 01:30:12,492
That was a brave thing you did.

566
01:30:13,785 --> 01:30:16,454
- Did it work?
- Yeah.

567
01:30:16,621 --> 01:30:23,461
She's fine. She took on a few of your
more charming personality traits for a while.

568
01:30:24,337 --> 01:30:26,840
But we lived through it.

569
01:30:29,383 --> 01:30:32,011
I think she's a little taken with you.

570
01:30:32,178 --> 01:30:36,599
Well, you can tell her
my heart belongs to someone else.

571
01:30:41,437 --> 01:30:43,689
You know, you and I...

572
01:30:43,856 --> 01:30:45,900
How's the professor?

573
01:30:47,777 --> 01:30:50,029
He's good.

574
01:30:50,196 --> 01:30:52,240
Good.

575
01:30:56,911 --> 01:31:01,207
There's an abandoned military compound
at Alkali Lake in the Canadian Rockies

576
01:31:01,374 --> 01:31:05,503
close to where we found you.
There's not much left but...

577
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:08,131
you might find some answers.

578
01:31:10,258 --> 01:31:14,303
- Thank you.
- Are you going to say goodbye to them?

579
01:31:16,806 --> 01:31:19,976
<i>The Mutant Registration Act
lost its main proponent</i>

580
01:31:20,143 --> 01:31:22,896
<i>with the reversal of Senator Robert Kelly</i>

581
01:31:23,062 --> 01:31:27,483
<i>who until now had provided the loudest
voice in the cry for mutant registration.</i>

582
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:33,531
<i>I was wrong in this particular issue and I
hope, in time, I may be forgiven. Thank you.</i>

583
01:31:33,698 --> 01:31:36,701
<i>The Mutant Registration Act
continues to draw support...</i>

584
01:31:36,868 --> 01:31:38,912
Mystique.

585
01:31:39,954 --> 01:31:42,039
Son of a bitch.

586
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:49,589
<i>...from many parents' rights groups who feel
threatened by unidentified mutants.</i>

587
01:31:49,755 --> 01:31:53,259
<i>In a related story, the body
of Senator Kelly's aide,</i>

588
01:31:53,426 --> 01:31:56,262
<i>Henry Guyrich, was found today.</i>

589
01:31:56,429 --> 01:32:01,726
<i>Preliminary coroner's reports seem to
indicate that Guyrich was mauled by a bear.</i>

590
01:32:02,226 --> 01:32:03,477
Hey!

591
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:11,569
- You running again?
- Not really.

592
01:32:13,029 --> 01:32:16,365
I have some things to take care of up north.

593
01:32:21,704 --> 01:32:23,998
I kinda like it.

594
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:30,463
I don't want you to go.

595
01:32:43,726 --> 01:32:46,229
I'll be back for this.

596
01:33:24,267 --> 01:33:26,644
Doesn't it ever wake you in the night,

597
01:33:26,811 --> 01:33:31,774
the feeling that someday they will pass
that foolish law, or one just like it,

598
01:33:31,941 --> 01:33:34,026
and come for you?

599
01:33:34,193 --> 01:33:36,445
And your children?

600
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:42,285
It does indeed.

601
01:33:46,831 --> 01:33:49,792
What do you do when you wake up to that?

602
01:33:49,959 --> 01:33:56,757
I feel a swell of pity for the poor soul who
comes to that school looking for trouble.

603
01:34:05,433 --> 01:34:07,477
Why do you come here, Charles?

604
01:34:07,643 --> 01:34:11,063
Why do you ask questions
to which you already know the answers?

605
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:15,526
Oh, yes. Your continuing search for hope.

606
01:34:26,203 --> 01:34:30,041
You know this plastic prison of theirs
won't hold me for ever.

607
01:34:30,207 --> 01:34:34,837
The war is still coming, Charles,
and I intend to fight it.

608
01:34:35,796 --> 01:34:38,507
By any means necessary.

609
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,802
And I will always be there.

610
01:34:43,387 --> 01:34:45,890
Old friend.
