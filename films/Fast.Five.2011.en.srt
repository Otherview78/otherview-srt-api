1
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,779
Judge: Dominic toretto.

2
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,614
You are hereby sentenced
to serve 25 years to life

3
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:45,622
at the lompoc maximum security
prison system

4
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,704
without the possibility of early parole.

5
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,370
Here's what we know so far

6
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,950
this is all the aftermath of
a daring, daylight breakout.

7
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,127
There were 26 high-risk
inmates being transferred...

8
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,859
A daring midday breakout where everyone
on board has been accounted for,

9
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,623
except for one, Dominic toretto.

10
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,862
Police have just released the identity

11
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,364
of the man they believe to have
orchestrated the shocking escape

12
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,050
that amazingly resulted in no
fatalities this afternoon.

13
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,966
He is former federal agent,
Brian O'Conner.

14
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,053
A fierce manhunt is underway
for three fugitives tonight,

15
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,892
multiple federal and local
agencies have joined forces

16
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,564
in the search for Dominic toretto

17
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,940
and his accomplices Brian
O'Conner and Mia toretto.

18
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,729
But despite every eye in the
country looking for them

19
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:41,400
where toretto and O'Conner
are now is anyone's guess.

20
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,524
It's got to be it, right?

21
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,883
Let's get out of here.
Vince: Whoa, whoa!

22
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,056
Mia.

23
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,604
Vince.

24
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,394
Buster.

25
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,772
Come on.

26
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,692
Dom here yet?

27
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,027
No.

28
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,861
When was the last time
you heard from him?

29
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,952
A couple of weeks ago.
Up in Ecuador somewhere.

30
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,585
Vince: How does it feel? What's that?

31
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,548
To be on the other side
of a wanted poster?

32
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,755
He'll show up.

33
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,048
Yeah.

34
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,385
Dom's?

35
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,065
Yeah.

36
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,567
Mia: Aw.

37
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,737
Good night.

38
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,143
Why rio, Vince?

39
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,646
You mean after you
screwed everything up in la?

40
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,815
Ended up free-falling through
south America, you know,

41
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,068
hitting every hellhole on the way down.

42
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,613
Would have kept
on going if not for Rosa.

43
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,944
So, listen.

44
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,156
There is a job coming up.

45
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,150
I was hoping dom
was going to be here by now

46
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:55,779
but this one is clean enough
we can do it without him.

47
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:01,119
It's a good gig. Couple of
high-end cars, easy targets.

48
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,164
Guy I know is putting together
a team to swipe them.

49
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,502
Just need a few more willing bodies.

50
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,342
I don't know.

51
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,178
Look, the way the car
scene is down here

52
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,181
we can unload them quick
and get top dollar.

53
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,346
It's easy money.

54
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,636
And from where I'm sitting,

55
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,890
it looks like you both
could use the payday.

56
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,723
What are you reading?

57
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,558
Travel guide.

58
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,230
Yeah?

59
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,573
Tokyo.

60
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,405
Moscow.

61
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,916
Goa.

62
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,062
You want to know what all of
these places have in common?

63
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,201
Huh?

64
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,369
No extradition.

65
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,893
Here we go.

66
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,112
Excuse me, buddy.

67
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,003
Okay.

68
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,986
Hey, we've found them.

69
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,826
Yeah, second-to-the-last freighter.

70
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,841
What is it?

71
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,505
DEA tags. These cars have been seized.

72
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,430
Look who showed up.

73
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,058
God, I'm so happy you're okay.

74
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,563
I thought I told you to lay low.

75
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,224
Been running on fumes.
Had to make a call.

76
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,569
Hey! Quit talking. We only
got the two-minute window.

77
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,063
Let's go, Vince.

78
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,776
I a dies first.

79
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:47,950
Hey!

80
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,459
Mia: Hey!

81
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,001
See you, baby.

82
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,361
Change of plans. Wait for my call.

83
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,861
Let's I's go!

84
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,338
Where is she going?

85
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,800
Where is she going? Hey!

86
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,389
Hey!

87
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,481
We're being robbed! Whatever
happens, don't stop the train!

88
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,052
Access card! Get the access card!

89
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,959
Shit.

90
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,869
Bridge! There is a bridge!

91
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,548
Luggage car is clear.

92
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,602
Freeze!

93
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,996
Oh, shit!

94
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,570
You had to make a call, huh?

95
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,357
Shitty call, O'Conner.

96
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,442
Shitty call.

97
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,133
You two stirred up
quite a bit of trouble today.

98
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,302
Three of my men dead.

99
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,804
Three DEA agents along with them.

100
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,391
Of course, this is business

101
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,976
and sometimes things go astray.

102
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,487
All I care about is the car.

103
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,816
Tell me where it is, and I'll let you go.

104
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,658
Brian: This roofing plastic says
you're full of shit.

105
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,247
I don't know how you guys do
business in your part of the world,

106
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,337
but here in rio,

107
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:13,089
I like it when all parties
know what they're up against.

108
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,631
Dom: That's funny.

109
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,259
Because it goes both ways.

110
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,178
You know,

111
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,767
I hear your sister is very beautiful.

112
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,643
Wherever she hides

113
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,267
I will find her.

114
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,923
Brian: Mia?

115
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,883
Hey.

116
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,926
You okay?

117
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,931
Yeah, you all right?

118
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,560
Hey.

119
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,192
Hey, yeah.

120
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,691
Just like a toretto.

121
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:06,903
Where's Vince?

122
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,696
That's a good question.

123
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,741
He'll be here.

124
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:12,994
Guys, we're all over the news.

125
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,412
They're blaming us for the killing
of those DEA agents on the train.

126
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,548
Which means we just jumped
to the top of the wanted list.

127
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,126
The feds have got to show everyone
their agents are off limits

128
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,367
and they're going to send their best guys.
We got to get out of here.

129
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,383
One thing we know for sure

130
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,473
is that they wanted this car.

131
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,395
Because something is in it.

132
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,271
If we find out what it is, we'll
know what we're up against.

133
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,316
Hobbs: All right, listen up! The men
we're after are professional runners.

134
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,173
They like speed and are guaranteed
to go down the hardest possible way

135
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,738
so make sure you got
your funderwear on.

136
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,629
We find them, we take them as a
team, and we bring them back.

137
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:10,175
And above all else, we don't ever,
ever let them get into cars.

138
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,848
Crime scene is 10 hours old and
counting, men. Let's go hunting.

139
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,145
Agente hobbs! Chief of
police, jodo alemeida.

140
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,355
Luke.

141
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,695
Sorry to hear about the loss of your men.

142
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,819
Is all this really necessary
to apprehend two men?

143
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,512
Let me tell you something
about these two men.

144
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,098
One is a former federal officer,
been in deep cover for five years.

145
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,002
He knows every way you're
going to come for him.

146
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,124
The other one is a professional
criminal, escaped prison twice,

147
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,702
spent half his life on the
run avoiding folks like you.

148
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,671
Well, if there's anything
we can do to help the dss...

149
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,798
Two things. One, I need a translator.

150
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,362
We have plenty in the public
relations department.

151
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,217
Elena neves.

152
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,213
A patrol officer? You heard me.

153
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,178
But why? We have many
more experienced people.

154
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,219
I like her smile.

155
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,220
What's the second thing?

156
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,232
Stay the fuck out of my way.

157
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,069
Brian.

158
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,982
I have something I have to tell you.

159
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,745
Vince: God damn.

160
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:18,580
What a mess!

161
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,083
Where you been, man?

162
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,716
You better check that tone.

163
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,642
And you just better answer
the goddamn question.

164
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,217
Stop it! Both of you.

165
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,717
Where were you, Vince?

166
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,896
Guys all over the favelas
asking about you.

167
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,557
Couldn't get out of there without
leading them straight to you.

168
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,725
Had to wait them out.

169
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,564
That is such horseshit.

170
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,758
That was your job,
and those were your guys! Hey!

171
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,397
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!

172
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,236
If he said he didn't do it, he didn't do it.

173
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,446
Go walk it off.

174
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:10,136
Reyes: Look, I would love to expand
my operations into your countries

175
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:14,135
but, quite frankly, your business
methods are too violent.

176
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,472
Let me tell you a true story.

177
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:22,060
Five hundred years ago, the
Portuguese and the Spanish came here,

178
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,609
each trying to get the country
from their natives.

179
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:32,317
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,
determined to prove who was boss.

180
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,951
The natives killed every single spaniard.

181
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,748
Personally, I prefer
the methods of the Portuguese.

182
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,002
They came bearing gifts.

183
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,333
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

184
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:53,967
Things that the natives
couldn't get on their own,

185
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:57,258
but to continue receiving them, they
had to work for the Portuguese.

186
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:01,846
And that's why all Brazilians
speak Portuguese today.

187
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,354
Now, if you dominate
the people with violence,

188
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,692
they will eventually fight back
because they have nothing to lose.

189
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,449
And that's the key.

190
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:17,323
I go into the favelas and
give them something to lose.

191
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,155
Electricity, running water,

192
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,370
school rooms for their kids.

193
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,791
And for that taste of a better life,

194
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,340
I own them.

195
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:32,547
Gentlemen.

196
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,725
Pardon me, gentlemen.

197
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,871
Dom: Almost wish I didn't see that.

198
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,080
Almost.

199
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,253
Wait, dom.

200
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,501
Mia was on that train.

201
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,211
My sister!

202
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,423
I didn't know. I wouldn't
do anything to hurt her.

203
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,884
You set up the deal!

204
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,603
I thought the job was for the cars.

205
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,771
I didn't know.

206
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,265
All they want is the chip.

207
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,019
Damn!

208
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,359
You should've come clean.

209
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,986
What's going on out here?

210
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,109
Nothing.

211
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,661
Please, dom, just let me have the chip.
I can take this to them.

212
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,865
They'll give it to reyes
and set things right.

213
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,998
Get out.

214
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,875
What?

215
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,001
Get out!

216
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,140
You never listen to me.

217
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,936
Not when I told you
he was a cop, and not now.

218
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,683
You never trust me
and look where it's gotten us.

219
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,067
Look at our family now.

220
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:18,191
I can't go home! Your sister
is stuck in this life!

221
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,279
Where's letty, dom?

222
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:23,863
Where's letty?

223
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,722
Plasma cutter.

224
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:53,059
Wilkes, I want a list
of every place within 50 miles

225
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,893
that distributes compressed gas tanks.

226
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,070
Pass me that manifest.

227
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,738
Officer neves. Been waiting for you.

228
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,244
You asked for me? I did.

229
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,950
May I ask why?

230
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,453
My smile is not that great.

231
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,671
Your husband was an officer who
was gunned down in the favela.

232
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,682
Six months later, you upped
and joined the force.

233
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,928
You're motivated.

234
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,766
Plus, I figure you're the only
one in rio who can't be bought.

235
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,263
Am I right?

236
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,687
Yes. Of course I am.

237
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,934
Good news, bad news.

238
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,686
You know I like my dessert first.

239
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,733
Back-checked the rail line like you asked.

240
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,901
Found a couple of spots
where they unloaded the cars.

241
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,613
One set of tracks headed west

242
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,357
until it hit the main highway,
then disappeared.

243
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,805
But another set of tracks headed east.

244
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,195
A 107-inch wheelbase,
eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

245
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,872
The gt40 that was missing
from the manifest.

246
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,540
Followed the trail a couple of miles.

247
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,833
Pretty easy in this scrub.

248
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,710
Can't move without leaving a sign.

249
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,207
Give me the damn veggies.

250
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,632
The ground rolls into a hard pack
and we lost that track, too.

251
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,460
Not necessarily.

252
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,930
That road heads up through
the hills into the favelas.

253
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,349
Couple of years ago,
it was washed out by a storm.

254
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,810
It's all dirt a mile from where you were.

255
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:13,060
If they headed that way, we'll
pick up their tracks there.

256
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,391
You come prepared.

257
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,975
I'm motivated.

258
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,689
Hobbs: All right, then.

259
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,488
Let's find ourselves a car.

260
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,140
What do you think?

261
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,689
Well, it's definitely a custom chip.

262
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,352
Look at all these side menus
here for data entry.

263
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,277
Let's check this one.

264
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,446
Look at that.

265
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,949
Same building, same order every week.

266
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,031
It's a delivery schedule.

267
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,060
What's this?

268
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,395
Drugs?

269
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:39,395
No. That's a dealer pack.

270
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,397
See, most major players,
they weigh their money

271
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,353
so they don't have to constantly count it.

272
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,813
Right there, that's 49 kilos.

273
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,819
49 kilos is a million in twenties.

274
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,223
You're saying each one of these
shipments is worth 10 million dollars?

275
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,362
Yeah.

276
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,011
I thought so.

277
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,057
So what is that?

278
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,814
A 100-million plus in cash houses?

279
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,769
That's how he keeps it off the grid.

280
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,858
I think it's safe to say that
reyes is smart to want this back.

281
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,695
It's his whole network right
there, just laid out on a chip.

282
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,765
Wilkes, fusco, up the middle.

283
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,559
Mac, chato, flank north.

284
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,264
What about me?

285
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,481
Stay here.

286
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,622
Come on, go! Go!

287
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,428
Get on the ground.

288
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,852
I got toretto. Four blocks
north of your position.

289
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,900
They already know who you are.

290
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,264
Let's go.

291
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,269
All clear?

292
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:24,433
Clear. Clear.

293
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,650
You okay here?

294
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:43,449
Yeah. I'm good. Thank you.

295
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,028
They're going to be looking for
the three of us together now.

296
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,818
We need to split up.

297
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,746
You and Mia head south,
I'll lead them away.

298
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,913
No.

299
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,204
Dom is right.

300
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,064
Look how lucky we just got.
What happens next time?

301
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,190
We have no choice but to split up.

302
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,454
I'm pregnant.

303
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,794
I already lost my family once.

304
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,428
I'm not going through that again.

305
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,101
Are you kidding me? No.

306
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,976
I'm not going anywhere. Okay?

307
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,445
Dom?

308
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,486
Promise me we stick together.

309
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,116
I promise.

310
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,173
Our family just got bigger.

311
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,018
Something doesn't add up.

312
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:40,979
Toretto and O'Conner.

313
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:46,076
They stay when they're supposed to
run, they steal gas then give it away?

314
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:47,782
Now they're killing federal agents?

315
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,580
It doesn't make any sense.

316
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,453
Here's what makes sense.

317
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,713
All these guys are is hames on a list.

318
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,210
They come up, we take them down.

319
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,792
Not a phone call more, not a bullet less.

320
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,593
Wilkes, we get anything?

321
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,338
Standard forensics.

322
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,219
Shoe prints. Hair and fiber.

323
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,429
Prints are all over the car.

324
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,599
Anything else?

325
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,973
Yeah, we tracked the owner
off the vehicle ID.

326
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,583
There are a couple of shell
companies in between,

327
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,064
but we finally traced it
back to a corporation

328
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,814
owned by an investor down
here named hernan reyes.

329
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,984
Investor?

330
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:25,357
If there's anything illegal happening
in rio, reyes is involved.

331
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:27,067
Okay, then so are we.

332
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,432
If he could get us any closer to our
guys, I want everything on him.

333
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:30,787
Chato, you're on the roof.

334
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,227
I want you on overwaitch in case
somebody comes back for something.

335
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,617
Mac, give me a cross-check
on reyes, full specs.

336
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,982
If he goes to the John, I want to
know how many times he shakes it.

337
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,372
You got it, boss. Wilkes, fusco!

338
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,957
Let's put all this mess back together.

339
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,007
That's going to take a while.

340
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,338
Then you better get started.

341
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,411
They were taking
this car apart for a reason.

342
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,595
Let's put it back together
and find out what's missing.

343
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:23,256
Hey, dom, what do you
remember about your father?

344
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,426
My father.

345
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,842
He used to...

346
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:37,888
He used to have a barbecue
every Sunday after church.

347
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,932
For anybody in the neighborhood.

348
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,227
If you didn't go to church,
you didn't get any barbecue.

349
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:49,862
Every single day he was in the
shop, and every single night,

350
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:54,947
he was at the kitchen table with
Mia, helping her with her homework.

351
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,992
Even after she went to sleep,

352
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:02,124
he'd stay up for a few more hours

353
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:06,174
so he could learn the next chapter
and help her the next day.

354
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,134
I remember everything about my father.

355
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,008
Everything.

356
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,473
That's just it.

357
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,343
I don't remember shit about my dad.

358
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,522
I don't remember him yelling.

359
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,065
I don't remember him smiling.

360
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:28,033
To be honest with you, I don't even
remember what the hell he looked like.

361
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,942
I don't remember. He just...

362
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,153
He was just never there.

363
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,491
You ain't going to be like that, Brian.

364
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,260
We can't keep running, dom,

365
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,554
we got to get out.

366
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,560
We got to get out now.

367
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,108
You're right.

368
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,368
Here's how we're going to do it.

369
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,794
We're going to use this. J

370
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,796
we're going do one last job.

371
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,587
We're going to take all of reyes' money.

372
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,468
Every dime of it,

373
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,050
and disappear.

374
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,801
Forever.

375
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,390
New passports.

376
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:44,894
New lives with no more
looking over our shoulder.

377
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,645
And we're just going to buy our freedom.

378
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:47,771
That's right.

379
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,506
You realize we're talking
about going up against

380
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,930
the most powerful guy in all of rio?

381
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,613
Yes, we are.

382
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,946
Then we're going to need a team.

383
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,909
Let's run through the bases real quick.
Who do we got?

384
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,484
First we're going to need a chameleon.

385
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:11,750
Someone who can blend in anywhere.

386
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,794
What else?

387
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:14,923
A fast talker.

388
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,339
Someone who can bullshit
their way out of anything.

389
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:19,883
I got that.

390
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,248
This guy is going to have
a lot of surveillance.

391
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,352
We're going to need someone
who's good with circuits.

392
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,767
Dom: And with those circuits,
reyes is going to have walls.

393
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,148
We're going to need guys
to punch through those walls.

394
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,152
Mia: What else?

395
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,408
Utilities and weapons.

396
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,237
Someone who ain't afraid to throw down.

397
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,156
Someone to back up every position.

398
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,787
Brian: Yeah, what else do we heed?

399
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,492
Dom: Most importantly,

400
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,795
we're going to need
two precision drivers.

401
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,498
Guys that don't crack under pressure.

402
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,049
Guys that never lose.

403
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,631
You know we got that.

404
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,533
Aw, hell, no!

405
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,210
I see they really scraped
the bottom of the barrel, huh?

406
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:32,584
I guess they did, since your ass is here.

407
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,380
When are you going to give
Martin Luther King his car back?

408
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:40,214
As soon as you give
Rick James his jacket back.

409
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,594
What's up, man? What's up?

410
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,779
Sexy legs, baby girl.

411
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,076
What time do they open?

412
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:06,743
They open the same time
as I pull this trigger.

413
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,749
Want me to open them?

414
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,883
Hey, anybody can talk shit
in Spanish, homie.

415
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,814
Who are these clowns, man?
Circus clowns.

416
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,895
I thought cockfights were illegal in Brazil.

417
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,071
I see you all have met.

418
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,867
You know when you called me
to come to rio

419
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:45,787
I assumed it would be for something
more exciting than this.

420
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:46,908
Look at this guy.

421
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,081
Long time. I missed you, man.

422
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,248
Good to see you.

423
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,247
Brother. What's up?

424
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,420
Yo, check this out. This is tej.

425
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,418
Best circuit man on the east coast.

426
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:57,999
And this is my boy, Roman pearce.

427
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,585
We go way back, I met this guy in juvie.

428
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,295
I pulled that job with him in Miami.

429
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,800
I've heard about you.

430
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,466
Nice digs.

431
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,347
Yeah, well, the ritz was sold out.

432
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,636
So what's this all about, dom?

433
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:14,064
Yeah, man, why did you drag
us halfway around the world?

434
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,938
Because we got a job.

435
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,562
All right, so our target's
name is hernan reyes.

436
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,363
And he runs the drug scene down here.

437
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,987
He's never been busted because
he doesn't leave a paper trail.

438
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,114
No paper trail means no banks.

439
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,287
And no banks means cash houses.

440
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,786
That's right. Ten of them, to be exact.

441
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:33,038
Spread throughout the city.

442
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:34,960
And we're going to hit them alll.

443
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:37,539
All of them?

444
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:38,922
All of them.

445
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,966
That sounds crazy.

446
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,968
You bring us to a whole other country

447
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,137
so we can Rob the dude who runs it?

448
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,761
I thought this was business.

449
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,345
Sounds personal to me.

450
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:51,886
Is that what this is?

451
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:55,769
I got love for y'all, but
personal ain't good business.

452
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,644
I can't do this, homie.

453
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:05,025
So what we're talking
about is $100 million.

454
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:07,159
You say what?

455
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:10,864
,

456
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,995
And I know we just met, but
you just, kind of, got to...

457
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:17,829
That's right, $100 million,
and everything we take,

458
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,334
we split even.

459
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,211
Tej: That's a little over $11 million apiece.

460
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,585
I am down.

461
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,090
I'm in.

462
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,134
Eleven million.

463
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,266
Sounds like a whole lot of
vaginal activity to me.

464
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,015
You can't pull off 10 heists
on the same Mark.

465
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,186
You just can't.

466
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,810
As soon as we hit the first one,

467
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:39,608
they're going to do everything
they can to protect the rest.

468
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:42,399
Exactly.

469
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,626
That's all of it.

470
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,914
You a dead man.

471
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:41,086
You're all dead men!

472
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,414
You don't have a place to hide.

473
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:47,429
Who's hiding?

474
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,798
Thug: Are you crazy?

475
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,091
Are you crazy?

476
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:53,094
Do you know whose house this is?
Whose money are you stealing?

477
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,939
We ain't stealing it.

478
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:16,956
You tell your boss exactly who did this.

479
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,117
Tell him there's more coming.

480
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:26,836
Voila.

481
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,835
Turn it over.

482
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:38,136
She's running on all eight.
Checks out fine.

483
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,560
Keep looking.

484
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,145
Boss, if something
was missing, we'd know.

485
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:17,429
It's a goddamn shame putting
bullshit like that on a classic.

486
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,844
You may as well slap neon lights on it.

487
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:33,073
They took the chip.

488
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:36,911
We got a hit on the police scanner.
Armed robbery at a house in leblon.

489
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,479
Address cross-checks against property

490
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,221
owned by one
of hernan reyes' corporations.

491
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,452
All right, if that's our guys

492
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:44,081
then whatever was on that chip
led them directly to that house.

493
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,373
It's them, for sure.

494
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,795
How do you know that?

495
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:51,216
Because no one else in rio
is stupid enough to Rob reyes.

496
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,025
Number one is on the move, man.

497
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,006
Rome: Two is on the move.

498
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:20,782
I got mine.

499
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,715
I got eyes on five.

500
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:13,752
I know y'all said they were
consolidating the money somewhere, but,

501
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:17,081
y'all ain't going to believe this.

502
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,135
Well, this job just got a lot harder.

503
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,644
If he's moving it into a police station

504
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:34,265
he's got some serious
brass in his pocket.

505
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,144
Hell, yeah, we can't do this.

506
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,772
"Can't"? You mean, "shouldn't."

507
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,783
I think this doesn't change a thing.

508
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,159
I say we stick to the plan.

509
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,953
You say what?

510
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:53,705
This just went from mission: Impossible

511
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:55,661
to mission: In-freaking-sanity.

512
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,123
Whatever, man.

513
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:02,631
I ain't scared, I'm just letting you all
know, going in that building is crazy.

514
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,136
Brian: I got this.

515
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,011
What time was the robbery?

516
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,975
Around 11:00.

517
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,729
Here we go.

518
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,391
Enhance it.

519
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,986
Their faces are covered.

520
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,146
Run it through frs.

521
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,862
Well, hello, you son of a bitch.

522
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:35,834
Wilkes! Run the photos of known
associates of toretto and O'Conner

523
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,712
against customs entries into
Brazil in the last two weeks.

524
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:42,004
Check planes, trains, boats, everything
short of the goddamn space shuttle.

525
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,387
They can change their names but
they can't change their faces.

526
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,260
Something big is going down.

527
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,388
That's a 1970 charger.

528
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,607
Fusco! Upload these specs
into the database.

529
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:01,026
Have the computer cross-check
it with overhead satellites

530
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,062
every 15 minutes, the Van behind it, too.

531
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:05,959
If these vehicles move in the streets
of rio, I want to know about it.

532
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:32,568
The beauty of public offices?

533
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,457
Public records.

534
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:39,637
This is where he's keeping the money.
The vault in the evidence room.

535
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:44,663
Um. Uh, yeah. Can I get everyone's
attention, right here, for a second?

536
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,463
We're talking about breaking
into a police station.

537
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,301
Is anyone listening to those words?

538
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,837
Anybody? Popo?

539
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:54,590
Five-o. One-time. Pigs.

540
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:55,974
People we don't like.

541
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,977
You know, police stations are
designed to keep people in, not out.

542
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,342
That's why it's a stealth mission.

543
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,481
We'll be in and out before
they even know we were there.

544
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:05,108
Well, we'll need to get eyes in there.

545
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,610
At least to find out the make
and model of that vault.

546
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:11,153
So the vault and then, so...

547
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,695
It's crazy

548
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:15,661
who's supposed to do all this?

549
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:25,996
What do you mean?

550
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,297
Why me?

551
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,299
Because you got the biggest mouth.

552
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,336
That's for damn sure.

553
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,177
Ooh.

554
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,393
Hello, beautiful.

555
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:46,187
Look at those dimples. Sexy, sexy.

556
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,318
Love those glasses.
Where did you get them from?

557
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,729
Are those like Gucci frames
or something?

558
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:52,026
No English?

559
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,901
No, no, no. Damn.

560
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,530
How are you, sir?

561
00:56:56,997 --> 00:57:00,740
Special agent O'Conner. Us
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

562
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,082
It says Caucasian.

563
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:05,164
That's a tan. You know, a tan?

564
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:12,043
Look, I'm working this case and I
got some evidence here to be held.

565
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,545
But I need to get in and check
your storage facility first.

566
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:15,716
Nope.

567
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:19,054
Look, I know you're a true professional,
and I respect you, I promise.

568
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,262
You know, it looks like you
work out a little bit, too.

569
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,846
What do you bench, about 3507?

570
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,392
Ah, shit.

571
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,837
Look, I'm just trying to do my job, man.

572
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,728
My boss sent me here to just make
sure that everything was safe.

573
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:31,861
It will be safe.

574
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:33,898
Let me just come in
and take a quick peek.

575
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,069
Nope.

576
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,609
Come on, man. Hook a
brother up, please?

577
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:39,361
Nope. And you're not my brother.

578
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,741
Brother from another mother?

579
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:44,033
Look! No one enters the facility
but authorized evidence personnel.

580
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,246
Now stop wasting my time.

581
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:46,522
I'm going to call the embassy.

582
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,911
No, no, no! No, we're good.

583
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,376
We don't need to call them.
For what? We're good.

584
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,041
Here, I got the box. We're all good.

585
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:56,053
I promise you. Thank you
so much for your time.

586
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:58,338
Swear to god, if you were on
the other side of that glass

587
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:00,758
I'd bust your damn face in.
Now translate that.

588
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:22,283
It's done. See, I think I make a better
special agent than you ever did.

589
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:26,416
Well, that depends
on how you define “special.”

590
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:30,775
Tej: Come on, now.
Let's see what we got.

591
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,255
Not funny.

592
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,135
All right, come on.

593
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,930
Dawg, you still can't drive.

594
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,484
Now, I see why you're always
getting into accidents.

595
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,819
You can't even drive
a damn remote control car.

596
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,813
I'm going to need you
to shut up right now.

597
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,986
I'm not going to shut up. Shut up.

598
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,484
Strap him in his safety belt, man.

599
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:04,976
Give me the remote, dawg. Go left.

600
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,520
It looks like something right over
there to the left. What is that?

601
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,624
Brian: What is that?

602
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,043
Bingo.

603
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:14,165
What is that, six-by-six?

604
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:15,336
Eight-by-twelve.

605
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:16,959
Seven-by-twelve.

606
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:20,129
Fitted with 18-inch-thick
steel reinforced walls

607
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:23,807
with a insulated copper core to
protect against thermal Lance.

608
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:27,310
A class-3 electronic lock with
a surefire Griffin retumbler

609
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,137
and a biometric palm scanner.

610
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:31,682
Ten tons of top-of-the-line security.

611
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,479
Do I want to know
how you know all that?

612
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,519
I had a life before
you knew me, O'Conner.

613
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,486
Let's just leave it at that, all right?

614
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,193
She is a beauty, though, man,

615
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,487
a "beauty" as in "good"?

616
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:44,243
"Beauty" as in, she's going to
start off playing hard to get.

617
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:48,665
Then, no matter how much I caress
her, no matter how much I love her,

618
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,998
in the end, she still ain't
going to give up that ass.

619
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,673
It's one of the toughest vaults
to crack in the business.

620
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,071
And we ain't gonna get anywhere with it,

621
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,086
unless we got a duplicate
to practice with.

622
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,590
Bet that.

623
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:07,676
So assuming you'll breach the safe,

624
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:08,851
how the hell do we get in?

625
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:11,084
Brian: Yeah, I've been
thinking about the way in.

626
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,599
The wall to the evidence room,
that's alarmed.

627
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,183
So, that's not happening.

628
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:18,070
Then we got this one here, but
there's a guard shack outside,

629
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:19,904
so that's no good.

630
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:23,696
But this one, this one shares a
wall with the basement bathroom.

631
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:28,038
So, what about the money? That's
gonna be some heavy shit to move.

632
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:30,199
And you're talking about
five ton cash weight.

633
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,063
Yeah, but that's the thing
about the bathroom.

634
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,794
It's got a vent that
leads to the parking garage.

635
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,542
All we gotta do is pop that vent

636
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:39,966
and then pass the money
through to some waiting cars.

637
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,632
Leo. Santos.

638
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,221
You're up.

639
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,427
Yo, why you got to be so
negative all the time, man?

640
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:59,145
I'm telling you, man, you got issues.

641
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,555
I got this. Relax, man.

642
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,556
Relax.

643
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:26,193
Relax.

644
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,965
Can I have some light?

645
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,613
Brian: Yeah, we're looking
at four cameras.

646
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,017
Yo, that's some high-end shit, too.

647
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:37,181
Marker optics.

648
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,603
Hundred-degree field-of-view.

649
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:41,314
Ten seconds oscillation.

650
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:43,479
Yeah, that's a narrow window, man.

651
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,208
Can't we just tap in
and replace the image?

652
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,271
No, it's hooked into a digital sync.

653
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,315
They would know we were in the system.

654
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:51,487
The best we can do is peek.

655
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:54,156
We're going to need some real
fast cars to get through this.

656
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:55,699
Not just fast.

657
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:58,160
You got a hard right and a hairpin.

658
01:03:58,293 --> 01:03:59,999
We're going to need something agile.

659
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:01,785
You guys mock up a track.

660
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:02,873
O'Conner.

661
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:05,630
Let's go get some cars.

662
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,499
Nice.

663
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,798
Home sweet home.

664
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:07,854
Brian: Or that.

665
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:11,187
How about that?
All motor, no tuning issues.

666
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,573
I always wanted one of those.

667
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:17,319
Held the record on the
avenida three years running.

668
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:22,536
You got a lot of balls to bring
your problems here, toretto.

669
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:25,744
Not to mention a cop.

670
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,087
Yeah, we can keep that on the low.

671
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,086
Word on the street is a lot of
people are looking for you two.

672
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,088
What?

673
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,094
You didn't think we'd recognize you?

674
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:38,507
No, we're kind of counting on it.

675
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,225
That little coupe may run
the streets around here,

676
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:46,769
but that monster has never
seen a set of tail lights.

677
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:48,775
Ever. Well, she's about to.

678
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,617
Let's go, legend.

679
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:05,075
Car for car.

680
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:06,959
Car for car?

681
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:08,912
Diogo: You want it, come and get it.

682
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,426
Let's see what they got.

683
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:23,101
Really?

684
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:27,980
Where did you get
that from? Papa smurf?

685
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,934
Okay, O'Conner, give it your best shot

686
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,003
How was that one?

687
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:56,174
Camera caught you.

688
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:58,628
, it still caught you.

689
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,681
Man, I was milking the hell
out of that thing, too.

690
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,174
We're going to need a faster car.

691
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:09,514
I want my money. Come on, man.

692
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:14,311
Yeah!

693
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,697
Let's get it! Watch this.

694
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:28,959
That's exactly why your ass
ain't been driving.

695
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:42,176
I think I'm in love.

696
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:47,469
That was real solid work.

697
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:51,056
I think camera 3 still caught you, though.

698
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,310
Let's do it again.

699
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,737
Tego: That's the piggy bank you ordered.

700
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:03,825
You're kidding me. Yep.

701
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:08,407
Where in the hell
did y'all get one of these?

702
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,999
Well, we had a life before you met us.

703
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,580
All right, I'll get to work
on the electronic tumbler

704
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,878
but there's still another problem.

705
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:19,918
Palm scanner.

706
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:21,753
And without reyes' handprint,

707
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,214
Houdini himself couldn't open this bitch.

708
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:26,258
How do you know it's reyes' handprint?

709
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:28,100
You got $100 million in a safe.

710
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:30,149
You going to put somebody
else's handprint on it?

711
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:33,015
Now there you
go with that negativity, man.

712
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,440
That shit is eating you alive.

713
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:35,767
You check that.

714
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,944
Yo, check that. Shut up!

715
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:40,067
How are we supposed to get
reyes' handprint?

716
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,903
Dom: Han.

717
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,032
You're up.

718
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:51,415
Let's go. I'll drive.

719
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:11,807
I make six bodyguards. Seven.

720
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:15,815
You think that guy with a
Fanny pack is a tourist?

721
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,319
So, how long were you in the army?

722
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,242
That gun you pulled the other
day was a Jericho 941.

723
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,320
Thumb-racking the slide?

724
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,246
That was straight-up Mossad.

725
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,329
I got out of the military

726
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:38,497
probably the same time
you quit smoking.

727
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:40,502
The amount of chips you eat,

728
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:44,093
the way you always have to keep
your hands and mouth busy,

729
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,762
you were a two-pack-a-day man for sure.

730
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,466
Unfiltered.

731
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:55,604
Well, this is a bust.

732
01:09:56,693 --> 01:10:00,106
We're not going to be able to
get his fingerprints out here.

733
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:03,188
We need to do some more recon,
call in a couple of extra guys.

734
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:04,609
Or

735
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:07,199
You don't send a man
to do a woman's job.

736
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:08,215
We're going to figure
this out, I promise you.

737
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:12,848
What's up?

738
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:15,927
I thought you were more of a thong man.

739
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,394
We got the print.

740
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,265
Where?

741
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,234
Okay, that's crazy.

742
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:30,442
So, did he just slap that ass or
did he grab and hold on to it?

743
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:35,075
Hey, this will work.

744
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:36,948
Tej: I'm impressed.

745
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,034
Got it? Tej: Got it.

746
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,868
But you still didn't answer the question.

747
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:49,252
Oh, no. Guys, guys!
Guys, we have a problem.

748
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,591
The whole team just got burnt.

749
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,886
Now we're all wanted.

750
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,099
Gisele: How did this happen?

751
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:01,769
Us diplomatic security service
issued the warrants.

752
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,649
Agent I. Hobbs.

753
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,105
Hold on one second.

754
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,274
Hey, dom.

755
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,648
Is that the guy you saw in the favela?

756
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:14,656
Yeah.

757
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:18,489
Hobbs is the leader of the
elite task force for the dss.

758
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,664
So he's good.

759
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:22,831
When the FBI wants to find
somebody, that's who they call.

760
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:24,670
Because he never misses his Mark.

761
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:27,666
This guy is old testament.

762
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,169
Blood, bullets, wrath of god.
That's his style.

763
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,842
And right now he's hunting us?

764
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:35,673
Dom, we got to move up our timeline.

765
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:36,848
Rome: Yeah, but how?

766
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:40,349
This thing's already been difficult
without Wyatt earp on our asses.

767
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:42,688
If anything, we need
more room to breathe.

768
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,437
Roman's right.

769
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:51,694
Think we need to get some fresh air.

770
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:57,699
We've got a hit. "70s charger.

771
01:12:57,832 --> 01:12:59,823
Let's get a move on!

772
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,874
Eastbound on avenida atlantica.

773
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,330
Move, move, move, move!

774
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,220
It stopped about a block ahead.

775
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,348
Park it. We're going on foot.

776
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:41,746
Hey, toretto.

777
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,499
You're under arrest.

778
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:52,921
Arrest?

779
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,045
I don't feel like I'm under arrest.

780
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,089
How about you, Brian?

781
01:13:58,184 --> 01:13:59,264
No, not a bit.

782
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,510
Not even a little bit.

783
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,846
Just give it a minute. It'll sink in.

784
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,768
Brian: We didn't kill
those feds. That was reyes.

785
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,103
Hobbs: I don't give a shit.

786
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:14,940
I'm just here to bring in two
assholes whose names hit my desk.

787
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:18,526
Yeah, that sounds like a real hero.

788
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:26,355
From a guy who took the oath of a cop,
then went against everything it stood for.

789
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:28,119
Or some wannabe tough guy prick

790
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,546
who beat a man half to death
with a socket wrench.

791
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,460
Yeah, real tough.

792
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:36,715
You turn around and put your
hands behind your back.

793
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,300
I don't think so.

794
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:41,974
Your mistake is thinking you
got a goddamn choice, boy.

795
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:47,729
And your mistake?

796
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,940
Thinking you're in America.

797
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:56,564
You're a long way from home.

798
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:01,577
This is Brazil.

799
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,003
Come on, boss. Another day.

800
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:23,174
Come on, h, it's a lot of heat.

801
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,682
I'll see you soon, toretto.

802
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,644
I look forward to it, cop.

803
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:12,901
Yep.

804
01:16:13,027 --> 01:16:14,392
Tracker's on.

805
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:16,853
Got them.

806
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:25,259
I don't understand. Why come here?

807
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:28,808
Why risk it all for $20 worth of silver?

808
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:33,433
Because it's worth it.

809
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,775
You should run, you know.

810
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,944
Hobbs will find you.

811
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:46,826
You have every reason
to leave. Why stay?

812
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:56,164
Why do you?

813
01:17:57,882 --> 01:17:59,873
My husband was a good police officer.

814
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:02,333
An honest man.

815
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,461
We both grew up here.

816
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,801
Two years ago he was
murdered in the street

817
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:10,557
right outside our door.

818
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:16,851
Reyes owns this favela now.
He gives things to people.

819
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:21,481
But everything has a price.

820
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,906
The people here need a new start.

821
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,025
They need to be free.

822
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:39,537
You didn't kill those men in the train,

823
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:41,501
did you?

824
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:48,842
Now, why would you believe
anything I would tell you?

825
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,016
Hey!

826
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,108
Was she so special to you?

827
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:09,241
I never thought anyone
could understand how much.

828
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:14,071
But you do.

829
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:38,273
Yeah!

830
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:50,942
Close, but not enough.

831
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:52,951
Dom, the window is too small, man.

832
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:56,747
Only way we're going to beat the
cameras is with invisible cars.

833
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,873
And I know just where to get them.

834
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,252
Let's take a ride, boys.

835
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,225
Don't hurt yourself.

836
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,470
It's been a while since I've been
behind the wheel of one of these.

837
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,410
First time I've ever been in the front seat.

838
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:48,757
Rome, what took you so long?

839
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:52,928
I thought for sure you'd be showing up
with some chrome spinners or something.

840
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,096
Real funny.

841
01:20:56,518 --> 01:21:00,181
I got $100,000 that says I can take
you all in the next quarter-mile.

842
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:01,833
Yeah, your broke ass
has got a hundred grand.

843
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:04,189
If we pull off this job, I will.

844
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,020
The next two lights.

845
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,480
Hundred thousand.

846
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:11,280
We don't pull this job off,
we're probably dead anyway.

847
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:13,820
Let's make it a million.

848
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:17,035
I like that. All right, a
million-dollar quarter-mile.

849
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,826
All right, then.

850
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,662
You only live once. Let's do it

851
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:24,205
what do you say, dom?

852
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,336
We talking or we racing?

853
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:28,880
Just don't cheat this time.

854
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,126
Got to let that go.

855
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,229
Yeah!

856
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:56,407
Typical, Roman.

857
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:58,907
I'm going to get this money. I'm hungry.

858
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:08,917
Don't make it too easy for me, boys.

859
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,840
No!

860
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,715
Not this time, dom.

861
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:22,267
You got to want it, Brian.

862
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:54,300
Yeah! Owned you! Owned you!

863
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:11,395
Good race, O'Conner. Thanks, dom.

864
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:16,150
Do you know how long I've
been waiting for that shit?

865
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,197
I told you he didn't see it.

866
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,116
Your man right there?

867
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:22,616
He let off the throttle at the line.

868
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:25,413
You didn't do nothing. He let you win.

869
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:28,082
Bullshit.

870
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:52,020
Vince, what are you doing? Quiet!
They've been tracking you.

871
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:23,179
It's okay. Wait!

872
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:26,259
Reyes' guys were waiting
for me at the market.

873
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:28,852
Vince saved my life.

874
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:35,768
Dom: You hungry?

875
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,319
Yeah, sure. Good.

876
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,280
Because you're saying grace.

877
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:48,909
Thanks, Vince.

878
01:24:56,717 --> 01:25:00,130
Yo, this is how my momma
does it. Relax.

879
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:05,556
Yo, don't you be talking
about my momma.

880
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:10,219
Yeah, come on, baby. Who's good living?

881
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:12,430
To you, bro. Cheers, cheers, cheers.

882
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,765
Rome: So, we in Brazil. It's the good life.

883
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:15,940
Yeah.

884
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:19,737
So, you got a little more than
$10 or $11 million coming.

885
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:21,009
What you going to do with your money?

886
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:22,739
Me? Yeah.

887
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:25,533
Actually, man, I been thinking about
opening up a garage back home.

888
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:29,350
Place where people can bring their cars
and not get completely ripped off.

889
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:30,489
You know what I mean?

890
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:31,915
Really? Yeah.

891
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:34,914
So, your dream is to start a day job?

892
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:37,121
That's stupid. Like, why would...

893
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:39,797
No, it's not stupid at all. I love what I do.

894
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:40,987
That don't make no sense to me.

895
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:43,844
I know what I'm going
to do with my money.

896
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:47,714
Buying some cooking lessons
for my man.

897
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:49,682
See? See?

898
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:52,056
There you go with that negativity, man.

899
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:54,183
You know me.
Money ain't a goddamn thing.

900
01:25:54,274 --> 01:25:56,834
It's going to take a little more
than money to learn how to cook.

901
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:58,142
That's horrible.

902
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:02,358
But I heard they was looking for a
chef down at this animal shelter.

903
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:03,529
You might want to...

904
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:05,323
I know the manager.

905
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:12,410
Hey, dom.

906
01:26:15,128 --> 01:26:16,618
Listen.

907
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:21,090
I know that you're all set
for this job tomorrow,

908
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:22,916
but if you need an extra man, I could...

909
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:24,342
You're in.

910
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:34,307
There's always room for family.

911
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:41,814
Thank you.

912
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,525
Get something to eat.

913
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:50,944
Yeah.

914
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,539
Can you believe Mia calls this a curse?

915
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:00,499
She might be right.

916
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:07,302
You really like doing that stuff, huh?

917
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:11,799
When your life is on the line that's
when you learn about yourself.

918
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:18,513
That's a fair deal.

919
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:25,938
We're less than 24 hours from the
biggest celebration of our life.

920
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:28,318
Y'all need a refill. This is serious stuff.

921
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,695
No, I'm good. Cheers, baby.

922
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:31,401
I'm good. No, thank you.

923
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:32,531
No, she can't.

924
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,741
What do you mean? She can't.

925
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:39,747
What do you mean she can't? What is...

926
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:46,166
Are you serious right now?

927
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:49,970
Is that the reason you let him
beat you in the quarter-mile?

928
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:54,550
That was a baby gift.
No, that's messed up.

929
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:56,225
No, you're not taking that from me.

930
01:27:56,313 --> 01:27:57,928
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

931
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:02,312
So, did he just smack the ass or
did he grab and hold on to it?

932
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:03,729
Which one was it?

933
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:06,311
Congratulations. Thank you.

934
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:08,192
Rome: How can you keep this a secret?

935
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:10,274
Crazy, huh? Rome: It's your boy.

936
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:13,948
Rome: Why would you keep something
like that away from me?

937
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:16,075
Baby gift, huh?

938
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:19,166
I have no idea what they're
talking about. Oh?

939
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:22,244
Tej: What happened
to the pull-out method, man?

940
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,376
Toast. Toast.

941
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:36,967
Money will come and go. We know that.

942
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:41,471
But the most important thing in life
will always be the people in this room.

943
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:44,141
Right here.

944
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:47,815
Right now.

945
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,001
I'm all set.

946
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:07,998
Han: Yo, Santos. Van good?

947
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:11,301
You know we're always good, bro.

948
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:17,925
Hobbs is on the other side of the city.

949
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,601
We're not going to get a better window.

950
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:22,930
Okay, guys, it's show time!

951
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:24,605
First team in position, let's go.

952
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:25,933
Tego: Come on, let's do this.

953
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:39,283
Hey, dom.

954
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:42,199
I got eyes on Mia.

955
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:50,298
Moscow, Bali, goa, Hong Kong.

956
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:52,792
And what do they all have in common?

957
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:53,968
No extradition.

958
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:58,799
We're one hour away
from the rest of our lives.

959
01:29:58,894 --> 01:30:00,179
Yeah.

960
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:02,848
Cops!

961
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:06,648
Come on. Go.

962
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:19,903
You just made a big mistake.

963
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:23,324
Took me a while to find
that tracking chip.

964
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:25,271
But not as long to flip the receiver.

965
01:30:25,295 --> 01:30:26,785
You're going down, toretto.

966
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,836
I'm right here.

967
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:02,965
! Stand back. I got this.

968
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:15,402
Pull off! Dom! Please, stop!

969
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:22,074
Dom!

970
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:32,460
Dom!

971
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:36,270
Yeah.

972
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,568
We're coming in now.

973
01:33:41,157 --> 01:33:43,819
Have the marshals meet us
at the airport when we land.

974
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:53,082
Ambush!

975
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:13,933
Wilkes, suppression fire.
Shut them down.

976
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:19,814
Stagger-step. Cover me.

977
01:34:24,826 --> 01:34:25,861
Watch them!

978
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:38,543
Cut us loose!

979
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:40,622
Come on! Cut us loose!

980
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:50,118
We're good? Yeah, let's go, let's go!

981
01:37:23,463 --> 01:37:25,124
Vince: Hey, dom.

982
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:33,507
You've got to meet my son.

983
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:35,546
Nico.

984
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:41,803
I will.

985
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:45,977
He's a good kid.

986
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:52,404
You know, we named him after you.

987
01:37:54,202 --> 01:37:55,533
“Dominic.”

988
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:04,826
You've got my word, Vince.

989
01:38:11,344 --> 01:38:13,426
You were always my brother.

990
01:38:23,064 --> 01:38:25,555
I got eyes on Nico now.

991
01:38:36,244 --> 01:38:38,701
We need to move.
We don't have that much time.

992
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:39,906
I got us a flight out.

993
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:42,572
We can leave rio in the rearview
in the next five hours.

994
01:38:42,625 --> 01:38:44,411
Not to run away.

995
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,414
To finish the job.

996
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:50,713
Are you crazy, dom? We can't.

997
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:52,874
Rome: It's a suicide mission.

998
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:55,589
That's your man over there on the table.

999
01:38:56,973 --> 01:38:59,055
The plan is busted!

1000
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:01,765
This is bullshit, man.
Reyes knows we're coming!

1001
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:03,259
Tej: He's right.

1002
01:39:03,563 --> 01:39:06,396
They tripled the detail
at the police station.

1003
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:09,060
Tej: It's going to be a wall of gunfire,

1004
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:13,319
reyes doesn't get away with this.

1005
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:14,649
It's a trap, man.

1006
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:16,192
You know that.

1007
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:19,116
Dom, listen to them.

1008
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:22,369
Run, before it's too late. Leave rio.

1009
01:39:23,749 --> 01:39:25,080
You can be free.

1010
01:39:27,253 --> 01:39:29,244
Running ain't freedom.

1011
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:32,125
You should know that.

1012
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:39,633
You know you're all free
to make your own choices.

1013
01:39:43,895 --> 01:39:44,975
Hobbs: I'm in.

1014
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:55,986
I'll ride with you, toretto.

1015
01:39:59,285 --> 01:40:01,822
At least until we kill that son of a bitch.

1016
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:11,835
Brian: So what's the plan, dom?

1017
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:14,755
We can't just go
sneaking around anymore.

1018
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,171
We don't sheak.

1019
01:40:18,971 --> 01:40:22,088
The only thing he cares
about is his money.

1020
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:23,681
We pull that,

1021
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:26,095
we pull him.

1022
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:13,351
You ready?

1023
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:16,570
I'm ready.

1024
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:22,977
Call it out, Mia!

1025
01:43:23,072 --> 01:43:24,712
You've got a straight shot for two blocks.

1026
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:27,607
Go right. Got it.

1027
01:43:49,974 --> 01:43:51,555
Well, the plan is working.

1028
01:43:51,642 --> 01:43:56,511
You guys have every corrupt cop in rio
on your tail. You have to move fast.

1029
01:43:56,605 --> 01:43:57,685
What's the best route?

1030
01:43:57,773 --> 01:44:01,015
Okay, keep going straight another
half-mile onto rua fonseca,

1031
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:03,021
and then go left.

1032
01:44:06,782 --> 01:44:07,817
That ain't going to work.

1033
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:11,491
Spikes ahead, dom. We got spikes!

1034
01:44:11,912 --> 01:44:13,493
We're going right!

1035
01:44:14,874 --> 01:44:16,226
No, it's too tight, we're not going to fit.

1036
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:17,706
We've got no choice. Now!

1037
01:44:37,396 --> 01:44:38,556
Shit!

1038
01:44:45,196 --> 01:44:46,481
Holy shit!

1039
01:44:46,572 --> 01:44:49,439
Guys, I am hearing all this chatter.
Did you just take out a bank?

1040
01:44:58,501 --> 01:44:59,661
Two inbound!

1041
01:45:01,921 --> 01:45:03,440
All right, there's an alley
coming up on your left,

1042
01:45:03,464 --> 01:45:05,125
yeah, I got it.

1043
01:45:58,519 --> 01:46:00,134
You little bastard!

1044
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:26,001
All right, good job, dom. Right-hander,
right here, right-hander.

1045
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:34,489
Guys, there's a big group
coming at you from the south.

1046
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:36,299
You have to do something now!

1047
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:40,306
Hey, go wide.

1048
01:47:13,052 --> 01:47:14,132
Yeah!

1049
01:48:27,876 --> 01:48:29,207
You're all clear on the left.

1050
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:31,125
Good afternoon, officer!

1051
01:48:33,132 --> 01:48:35,544
License and registration, please!

1052
01:48:41,724 --> 01:48:44,636
Yes! This is big-boy stuff!

1053
01:48:44,727 --> 01:48:46,137
We're clear on the right.

1054
01:48:46,395 --> 01:48:47,475
Oh, man.

1055
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:55,316
Thanks, guys.

1056
01:48:55,696 --> 01:48:56,811
Any time.

1057
01:48:56,905 --> 01:48:58,395
I'll see you on the other side.

1058
01:48:58,490 --> 01:49:01,072
You guys just carved out
a 10-second window.

1059
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:02,570
Make it count!

1060
01:49:41,325 --> 01:49:42,405
Shit.

1061
01:49:52,795 --> 01:49:53,830
No!

1062
01:49:54,630 --> 01:49:55,710
There's too many of them.

1063
01:49:55,798 --> 01:49:58,079
Hey, there's too many of them.
We're not going to make it.

1064
01:50:01,512 --> 01:50:02,547
You're right, we aren't.

1065
01:50:03,722 --> 01:50:04,757
You are.

1066
01:50:04,848 --> 01:50:06,133
What are you talking about?

1067
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:08,762
Just let the vault go. Get out of there.

1068
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:10,558
You're a father now, Brian.

1069
01:50:10,646 --> 01:50:12,807
No, I'm not leaving you.
Now you stick with the plan!

1070
01:50:13,482 --> 01:50:14,892
It was always the plan.

1071
01:50:15,651 --> 01:50:16,891
Take care of Mia.

1072
01:50:16,985 --> 01:50:19,442
Dom, you listen to me now. Okay?

1073
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:21,316
You cut loose right now.

1074
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:18,997
I thought I told you to go on.

1075
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:23,168
Yeah, I had to make a call.

1076
01:53:40,772 --> 01:53:42,182
Help me.

1077
01:53:44,568 --> 01:53:46,559
That's for my team, you son of a bitch.

1078
01:53:50,741 --> 01:53:52,447
It's a hell of a mess.

1079
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:54,775
Yeah, it is.

1080
01:53:56,288 --> 01:53:58,028
You know I can't let you two go.

1081
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:00,121
I ain't made that way.

1082
01:54:02,878 --> 01:54:05,540
The way I see it, you've
earned yourselves 24 hours.

1083
01:54:06,715 --> 01:54:07,830
The money stays, though.

1084
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:11,212
It I were you, I'd use the time.

1085
01:54:11,553 --> 01:54:14,545
Make peace with whatever
demons you got left.

1086
01:54:19,019 --> 01:54:20,884
Because come tomorrow,

1087
01:54:22,272 --> 01:54:23,387
I will find you.

1088
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:36,528
Toretto!

1089
01:54:37,454 --> 01:54:38,739
I'll see you soon.

1090
01:54:41,583 --> 01:54:43,448
No, you won't.

1091
01:55:24,918 --> 01:55:25,998
Thanks, guys.

1092
01:55:26,086 --> 01:55:27,576
I'll see you on the other side.

1093
01:55:32,467 --> 01:55:34,924
You guys just carved out
a 10 second window.

1094
01:55:35,011 --> 01:55:36,251
Make it count!

1095
01:56:18,722 --> 01:56:20,428
Come on, baby.

1096
01:56:20,515 --> 01:56:22,380
Don't be mean.

1097
01:56:24,644 --> 01:56:25,724
Come on.

1098
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:51,450
Right this way, my dear.

1099
01:58:53,543 --> 01:58:55,374
You stay right here, I'll be right back.

1100
01:58:57,213 --> 01:58:59,374
So, this is your dream, huh?

1101
01:58:59,466 --> 01:59:00,751
It's enough for me, man.

1102
01:59:00,842 --> 01:59:02,207
I take it that's your dream.

1103
01:59:02,302 --> 01:59:04,918
Absolutely. What up, boy?
What's going on?

1104
01:59:05,013 --> 01:59:06,799
You good? Yes, yes.

1105
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:08,050
You know what's crazy?

1106
01:59:08,141 --> 01:59:10,757
There's only four of those
cars in the whole world.

1107
01:59:11,311 --> 01:59:13,723
Yeah, I got the only one
in the western hemisphere.

1108
01:59:14,230 --> 01:59:18,519
I made a sheikh in Abu Dhabi
an offer he could not refuse.

1109
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:21,101
Huh. That's a nice
lady you got there, too.

1110
01:59:21,196 --> 01:59:24,609
Absolutely. What's happening?

1111
01:59:25,408 --> 01:59:27,649
We got to go, man. Let's do this.

1112
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:29,405
Okay, I'll drive.

1113
01:59:29,496 --> 01:59:32,033
In that? Come on, man, no way.

1114
01:59:32,123 --> 01:59:34,409
No, no. Not in this.

1115
01:59:34,501 --> 01:59:35,661
In that.

1116
01:59:42,008 --> 01:59:43,498
Are you serious right now?

1117
01:59:44,344 --> 01:59:45,675
Man, this is crazy

1118
01:59:45,762 --> 01:59:50,347
yes, I guess that means there are
two in the western hemisphere, huh?

1119
01:59:51,184 --> 01:59:53,516
What's your smart ass got to say now?

1120
01:59:54,104 --> 01:59:57,471
You know what? We can always
shine together, baby.

1121
01:59:57,565 --> 01:59:59,977
Get dressed, man, we got things to do!

1122
02:00:12,372 --> 02:00:13,862
So, where to now?

1123
02:00:13,957 --> 02:00:15,447
I don't know.

1124
02:00:15,542 --> 02:00:17,954
Never been to Madrid.

1125
02:00:18,044 --> 02:00:20,786
I thought you wanted to go to Tokyo.

1126
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:22,996
We'll get there.

1127
02:00:23,091 --> 02:00:24,706
Eventually.

1128
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:25,941
Brian: Nice surprise.

1129
02:01:29,532 --> 02:01:31,193
Crazy, right?

1130
02:01:39,459 --> 02:01:42,451
This is the happiest
I've ever seen my sister.

1131
02:01:43,463 --> 02:01:45,454
It's because we're free.

1132
02:01:58,812 --> 02:02:01,144
You know, I want another shot.

1133
02:02:04,651 --> 02:02:05,731
Yeah?

1134
02:02:07,695 --> 02:02:09,401
Yeah.

1135
02:02:09,489 --> 02:02:11,320
No wagers, nobody else.

1136
02:02:11,366 --> 02:02:13,573
Just you and me, once and for all.

1137
02:02:20,667 --> 02:02:22,658
You sure you can handle
the disappointment?

1138
02:02:23,503 --> 02:02:24,913
Are you?

1139
02:02:27,173 --> 02:02:29,255
All right, O'Conner.

1140
02:02:29,342 --> 02:02:31,173
Let's see what you got.

1141
02:04:59,033 --> 02:05:00,819
You need to look at that.

1142
02:05:04,831 --> 02:05:06,742
Berlin, 3:00 A.M. this morning.

1143
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,833
A team of drivers
hijacked a military convoy.

1144
02:05:09,877 --> 02:05:11,708
Toretto? Nope.

1145
02:05:12,672 --> 02:05:13,672
I ain't interested.

1146
02:05:13,756 --> 02:05:16,589
Yes, you are. Keep looking.

1147
02:05:28,104 --> 02:05:29,935
Do you believe in ghosts?
