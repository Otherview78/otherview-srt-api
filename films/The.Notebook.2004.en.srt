1
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:00,573
Excuse me?

2
00:03:03,246 --> 00:03:05,476
Come on, honey.
Let's get you ready for bed.

3
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:19,956
I am no one special.

4
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,331
Just a common man with common thoughts.
I've led a common life.

5
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:30,439
There are no monuments dedicated to me,
and my name will soon be forgotten.

6
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,531
But in one respect,

7
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:36,237
I've succeeded as gloriously as
anyone who ever lived.

8
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:38,472
-Looking good, Duke.
-Feeling good.

9
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:41,516
I've loved another
with all my heart and soul...

10
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:44,449
...and for me that has always
been enough.

11
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:46,078
How's it hanging, Harry?

12
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:48,589
I keep trying to die,
but they won't let me.

13
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:50,818
Well, you can't have everything.

14
00:03:54,097 --> 00:03:54,961
Big day today.

15
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:57,532
You say that every day,
you old devil.

16
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:02,694
lt's a lovely day outside.
Let's take a walk.

17
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:04,501
I don't think so.

18
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:06,939
Well, we've got to get you out
of this room.

19
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:10,112
Come on now, honey.
Some fresh air would do you good.

20
00:04:10,247 --> 00:04:11,111
Hello?

21
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:15,378
I'm sorry. lt's not a good day.

22
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:17,645
I don't think she's up for anything.

23
00:04:17,787 --> 00:04:19,084
Hello?

24
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:21,623
This is Duke.

25
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:23,521
He's come to read to you.

26
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:25,524
Read?

27
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:29,392
No.

28
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:30,556
I don't know.

29
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,034
Oh, come on. You'll like him.
He's Very funny.

30
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:52,577
All right, now.
Where did we leave off?

31
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:56,619
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know.
lt was the night of the carnival.

32
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,524
Noah was there
with his friends Fin and Sara.

33
00:04:59,663 --> 00:05:02,029
-Noah?
-That's where they met.

34
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:05,858
June sixth, 1940.

35
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:08,802
Allie was 1 7 years old.

36
00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:11,406
Little man wins a prize.

37
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,406
-Thank you for playing.
-You're real funny.

38
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:14,903
Man, I clobbered that thing.

39
00:05:15,045 --> 00:05:16,603
I'm telling you, these games are fixed.

40
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:17,576
Hello.

41
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:20,508
Hi. What's your name?

42
00:05:28,358 --> 00:05:31,623
-Who's this girl with Sara?
-Her name's Allie Hamilton.

43
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:33,786
She's here for the summer
with her family.

44
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,727
Dad's got more money than God.

45
00:05:35,865 --> 00:05:37,594
-Hi, Fin!
-Hi, honey.

46
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,095
Look, I won you a prize.

47
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:42,398
Fin, thank you!

48
00:05:50,714 --> 00:05:52,648
You want some cotton candy?

49
00:05:57,987 --> 00:05:59,352
You want to dance with me?

50
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:00,678
No.

51
00:06:00,824 --> 00:06:02,052
Why not?

52
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:03,625
Because I don't want to.

53
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,593
Noah, she's with us.

54
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,721
Allie, you want
to ride the Ferris wheel?

55
00:06:09,432 --> 00:06:10,421
Good idea.

56
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,194
-I'd love to.
-All right.

57
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:13,794
Excuse me.

58
00:06:15,238 --> 00:06:16,170
Excuse me.

59
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:23,605
-Noah Calhoun.
-What?

60
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:26,113
Works down at the lumberyard with Fin.

61
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,519
He was about two inches away
from my face.

62
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:34,020
Yeah, I saw. That's Noah, though.

63
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:37,057
You know,
I'm surprised he even came over.

64
00:06:37,193 --> 00:06:38,820
I think he likes you.

65
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:00,882
-Hey quit it, you jerk!
-Get off me!

66
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:02,678
Have you flipped your lid?!

67
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:06,381
What are you doing?

68
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:09,924
-You can't do that!
-I'll pay you when I get down, Tommy!

69
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:11,424
I'm Noah Calhoun.

70
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:13,688
-So?
-So it's really nice to meet you.

71
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,196
-Allie, who is this guy?
-I don't know. Noah Calhoun.

72
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:18,960
-I would really like to take you out.
-Friend, do you mind?

73
00:07:20,403 --> 00:07:23,065
You can't sit more than two people
in a chair, Noah!

74
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:24,434
Okay, Tommy. All right.

75
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:30,641
Get down, Noah!
You're going to kill yourself!

76
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,077
Noah, cut it out.

77
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:33,648
Well, will you go out with me?

78
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:34,841
What?

79
00:07:34,984 --> 00:07:36,451
No!

80
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:38,053
-Never?
-No!

81
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:40,755
-Why not?
-Hey, pal, she just told you.

82
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,723
-Why not?
-I don't know, because I don't want to.

83
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:47,127
You leave me no other choice, then.

84
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:48,690
Oh, my God.

85
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:51,596
-Stop fooling around!
-What are you doing?

86
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:54,100
-Noah, grab the bar!
-I'll ask you one more time.

87
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:57,565
Will you or will you not go out
with me?

88
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,872
Goddamn, my hand's slipping.

89
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,670
Then grab the bar, you idiot!

90
00:08:01,811 --> 00:08:03,073
Not until she agrees.

91
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:04,271
Go out with him.

92
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:06,746
-Fine! I'll go out with you.
-What?!

93
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:09,181
-No, don't do me any favors.
-No! I want to!

94
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,843
-You want to?
-Yes!

95
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:12,648
-Say it.
-I want to go out with you!

96
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:15,189
-Say it again.
-I want to go out with you!

97
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:17,522
All right, all right, we'll go out.

98
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:20,220
You think you're so smart, don't you?

99
00:08:20,363 --> 00:08:22,058
That wasn't funny, you idiot!

100
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:24,359
Oh, it's okay. I'll take care of this.

101
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:27,167
What are you doing?

102
00:08:27,303 --> 00:08:28,167
Please don't do that.

103
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:31,302
-Don't do that.
-I can't believe it.

104
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:33,005
Oh, God.

105
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:37,444
You're not so cocky now, are you?

106
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,247
I'll get you for that.

107
00:08:39,382 --> 00:08:41,441
Maybe you will, maybe you won't.

108
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:46,315
Oh, will you look at that.

109
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,080
lt's that girl from the carnival.

110
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:52,854
You remember me?

111
00:08:53,596 --> 00:08:58,226
Yeah, sure. Mr. Underwear, was it?
How could I forget?

112
00:08:58,368 --> 00:08:59,528
Yeah, I'm really sorry about that.

113
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:03,867
lt was really stupid to crawl up
the Ferris wheel to talk to somebody.

114
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:05,474
But I had to be next to you.

115
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:08,643
I was being drawn to you.

116
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,544
Oh, jeez. What a line.
You use that on all the girls?

117
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:16,952
No.

118
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:19,953
Right. I saw you the other night
with Little Miss Ribbons.

119
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,954
-What are you doing tonight?
-What?

120
00:09:22,091 --> 00:09:23,558
Or tomorrow night, or this weekend.

121
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:25,888
-Why?
-Why? Our date.

122
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:28,054
-What date?
-The date you agreed to.

123
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:31,064
-No.
-You did. You promised and you swore it.

124
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,532
Well, I guess I changed my mind.

125
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:37,905
I know you get a dirty guy coming up
to you you don't know,

126
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,838
you don't know me. But I know me.

127
00:09:41,844 --> 00:09:46,406
And when I see something that I like,
I got to h-- I love it.

128
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:49,746
-I go crazy for it.
-What are you talking about?

129
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:52,282
Well, you.

130
00:09:54,524 --> 00:09:55,855
-You're good.
-What?

131
00:09:55,992 --> 00:09:58,984
-You're good.
-No. You're getting me wrong.

132
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:02,620
You're fantastic. You really are.
I'm impressed.

133
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:05,359
-I'm not usually like this. I'm sorry.
-Oh, yes, you are.

134
00:10:06,035 --> 00:10:08,094
I can be funny if you want.

135
00:10:08,237 --> 00:10:09,966
Pensive.

136
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:11,298
Smart.

137
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:13,308
Superstitious.

138
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,802
Brave.

139
00:10:15,044 --> 00:10:16,875
And I could be light on my feet.

140
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,742
I could be whatever you want.

141
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:22,617
Tell me what you want
and I'll be that for you.

142
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:25,311
You're dumb.

143
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:28,421
I could be that.

144
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:33,929
Come on, one date.
What's it going to hurt?

145
00:10:34,564 --> 00:10:35,963
I don't think so.

146
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:38,030
What can I do to change your mind?

147
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,828
Guess you'll figure something out.

148
00:10:41,604 --> 00:10:42,901
-Are you sure she's coming?
-Relax.

149
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,873
lt's all set up. We're meeting them for
the late show. Look. What'd I tell you?

150
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,480
Oh, my goodness. What a coincidence!

151
00:10:56,619 --> 00:11:01,852
Look who's here.
Allie, you remember Noah, don't you?

152
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:03,185
Yes, I remember.

153
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:04,884
Come here.

154
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:06,325
-Hi.
-Hi.

155
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:08,862
-lt's nice to see you again.
-You too.

156
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:11,223
-You look great.
-Oh, thanks.

157
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:13,232
Really, really great.

158
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:15,769
You do look great. You look great.
And I know I look great.

159
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:17,930
So can we please go see this movie?

160
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:19,507
Show's about to start.

161
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:21,367
After you.

162
00:11:21,878 --> 00:11:26,076
-You come back here, Li'l Abner!
-You ain't going to catch me, Daisy Mae!

163
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:28,649
lt's Sadie Hawkins Day,
I'm supposed to catch you!

164
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:32,016
-I'm faster than you!
-Oh, get over here.

165
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:34,180
No! No! No!

166
00:11:34,323 --> 00:11:35,790
I'll get you!

167
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,952
Go on and git!

168
00:11:39,996 --> 00:11:41,293
Here I come!

169
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:55,837
You catch-um Polecat fair and square.

170
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:02,473
Wait for me!

171
00:12:04,187 --> 00:12:05,586
What happened in that movie?

172
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,683
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

173
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:13,455
-What are you guys doing?
-Want to walk with me?

174
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:14,688
-Get in.
-What's going on?

175
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:16,428
We'll walk.

176
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:17,760
You guys love each other?

177
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:22,933
-I get it. You guys do love each other.
-Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

178
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,704
Okay, goodbye.

179
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:25,967
All right.

180
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:27,531
All right.

181
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:32,840
That was fun.

182
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:36,947
I haven't seen a movie in ages.

183
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,416
Really?

184
00:12:38,554 --> 00:12:41,079
Not since I was a little kid.

185
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,417
What?

186
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,260
I'm busy. I don't have a lot of time.

187
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:51,299
You're busy?

188
00:12:52,101 --> 00:12:53,591
I have a very strict schedule.

189
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:56,170
My days are all planned out.

190
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:57,904
I get up in the morning.

191
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,567
Breakfast, math tutor,
Latin tutor, lunch...

192
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:04,475
...tennis lesson, dance lesson,
sometimes both.

193
00:13:04,614 --> 00:13:08,141
French tutor, piano lesson,
then I eat dinner.

194
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:09,808
After dinner I spend time
with my family

195
00:13:09,952 --> 00:13:13,319
and then I catch up on some reading.

196
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:21,762
-Sounds like the road to success.
-You bet.

197
00:13:22,431 --> 00:13:24,956
I'm applying to all these colleges.

198
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:28,536
Radcliffe, Sarah Lawrence.
Those are the ones we want.

199
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:31,364
And who's ''we''?

200
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:33,240
What?

201
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:35,139
You just said, ''The ones that we want.''

202
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:38,274
Oh.Mama and Daddy.
We decide everything together.

203
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:41,816
Everything?

204
00:13:42,518 --> 00:13:46,386
No, not everything.
But the important things, yes.

205
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:51,024
And everything else you get
to decide all by yourself?

206
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:53,723
Don't be rude.

207
00:13:53,863 --> 00:13:55,125
I'm sorry.

208
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:00,059
Just trying to figure out
what you do for fun.

209
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:02,331
What do you mean?

210
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:05,697
I mean...

211
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:07,405
I don't know,

212
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:09,670
...all those things are things you
have to do, right?

213
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:12,678
So, what do you do because
you want to?

214
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,049
I just told you.

215
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:21,020
I don't know.

216
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:23,057
You're surprising me.

217
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:25,223
What?

218
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:27,522
I always figured you were kind of....

219
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:30,158
Kind of what?

220
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:32,198
Just...

221
00:14:34,036 --> 00:14:35,264
...free.

222
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:36,837
What?

223
00:14:36,973 --> 00:14:38,167
Free.

224
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,038
I am free.

225
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:44,779
You don't seem like it.

226
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:47,640
Well, I am.

227
00:14:51,354 --> 00:14:52,651
I want to show you something.

228
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:55,120
-What are you doing?
-Just come on.

229
00:14:56,058 --> 00:14:57,286
You'll get run over.

230
00:14:57,426 --> 00:14:58,950
By all the cars?

231
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:12,433
My dad and I used to come out here and
lay down and watch the lights change.

232
00:15:12,742 --> 00:15:15,905
Watch them go from green
to red to yellow.

233
00:15:17,313 --> 00:15:19,975
You could try it if you wanted to.

234
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:21,879
-No.
-Why not?

235
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:25,579
Because-- I don't know.
Will you just get up?

236
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:28,246
That's your problem. You know that?

237
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:30,790
You don't do what you want.

238
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:40,195
Ok.

239
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,747
What happens if a car comes?

240
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:00,856
You die.

241
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,820
-What?
-Just relax.

242
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,257
Just trust.
You need to learn how to trust.

243
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,797
Ok.

244
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:13,233
Painting.

245
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,271
You asked me what I do for me.

246
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:19,607
I love to paint.

247
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:21,641
You?

248
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:29,514
Most of the time I have all these
thoughts bouncing around in my head.

249
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:35,123
But with a brush in my hand,
the world just gets kind of quiet.

250
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:45,366
Get out of the street!

251
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,599
Are you okay?

252
00:16:58,381 --> 00:16:59,905
Why are you laughing?

253
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,780
That was fun.

254
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:12,057
Do you want to dance with me?

255
00:17:13,496 --> 00:17:14,463
Sure.

256
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,828
Now?

257
00:17:19,235 --> 00:17:20,133
Here?

258
00:17:21,604 --> 00:17:23,367
-Not supposed to dance in the street.

259
00:17:23,506 --> 00:17:25,303
-Supposed to dance in the street.

260
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:28,104
We don't have any music.

261
00:17:28,244 --> 00:17:29,233
Well...

262
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:31,202
...we'll make some.

263
00:17:50,332 --> 00:17:51,993
You're a terrible singer.

264
00:17:52,134 --> 00:17:52,998
I know.

265
00:17:55,404 --> 00:17:57,372
But I like this song.

266
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:54,428
''Southern summers are indifferent
to the trials of young love.

267
00:18:54,563 --> 00:18:56,622
Armed with warnings and doubts...

268
00:18:56,765 --> 00:18:59,700
...Noah and Allie gave a remarkably
convincing portrayal...

269
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:03,794
...of a boy and a girl traveling down
a very long road...

270
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:06,134
...with no regard
for the consequences.''

271
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:07,708
They fell in love, didn't they?

272
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:10,403
-Yes, they did.
-Good.

273
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:12,912
I like this kind of story. Go on.

274
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:19,347
''After that night,

275
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:22,946
Allie and Noah spent
every waking hour together.

276
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:25,617
And soon, they were inseparable.''

277
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:27,991
-Noah, come on!
-I'll beat you there.

278
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,358
Come on!

279
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:33,329
-That looks really nice.
-Try that. lt's really good.

280
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:39,699
That's really nice.

281
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,850
''--the primitive apples,
the pebble-stones

282
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:52,681
Beautiful dripping fragments...

283
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:56,757
...the negligent list of one
after another...

284
00:19:56,892 --> 00:20:00,919
...as I happen to call them to me
or drink to them...

285
00:20:01,063 --> 00:20:02,121
The real poems,

286
00:20:02,264 --> 00:20:04,994
(what we call poems
being merely pictures )

287
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:07,500
The poems of the privacy
of the night...

288
00:20:07,636 --> 00:20:09,228
...and of men like me

289
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:11,703
This poem, drooping shy and unseen...

290
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,037
...that I always carry,
and that all men carry....''

291
00:20:15,177 --> 00:20:17,304
Not bad for Whitman.

292
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:20,078
Hey, looks like you got a visitor.

293
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,645
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

294
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:25,618
Well, don't apologize.
Come on up here, darling.

295
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:29,584
We could use a little something
around here besides the smell of lumber.

296
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,151
-Dad, this is Allison Hamilton.

297
00:20:32,294 --> 00:20:34,524
-Allison, glad to meet you.
-Allie.

298
00:20:34,663 --> 00:20:36,392
-Allie.
-Pleased to meet you, Mr. Calhoun.

299
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:40,059
-Am I old or something? Call me Frank.

300
00:20:40,202 --> 00:20:41,999
Hey, come in and have a seat.

301
00:20:43,772 --> 00:20:47,003
-Allie. Well, she is purty, son.
-Yes.

302
00:20:47,142 --> 00:20:49,007
She's a lot prettier than you let on.

303
00:20:49,144 --> 00:20:52,136
-Oh, is that right?
-No, it's not right. Don't believe him.

304
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:53,111
What is this you got?

305
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:56,377
I brought you something.

306
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:58,817
Well, let's see. Let's have a look.

307
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:01,512
Did you do this?

308
00:21:01,657 --> 00:21:03,056
Well, that's beautiful. Look at that.

309
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:04,853
That's a damn picture there.

310
00:21:06,295 --> 00:21:07,853
Well,
I know just where we can put that.

311
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:09,225
Thank you.

312
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:13,199
That was a lovely poem. What was it?

313
00:21:13,335 --> 00:21:14,529
-Well--
-Whitman.

314
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:18,833
See, when he was a little kid he used
to stutter real bad.

315
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:20,771
-Dad.
-Well, you did.

316
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:23,402
-I didn't know that.
-I stammered.

317
00:21:23,545 --> 00:21:25,206
Stammered, stuttered,
what's the difference?

318
00:21:25,347 --> 00:21:30,580
Couldn't understand him.
So I got him to reading poetry out loud.

319
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,953
lt wasn't very pretty at first,
but then his stutter went away.

320
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:36,853
-That's a good idea.
-Yeah, I thought so.

321
00:21:36,992 --> 00:21:39,927
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

322
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:43,190
I'm a Tennyson man myself
and he likes Whitman for some reason.

323
00:21:43,332 --> 00:21:44,196
I don't know.

324
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,029
Say, how would you like some breakfast?

325
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:48,466
-Breakfast?
-Yeah.

326
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:50,128
Dad, it's 10:00.

327
00:21:50,272 --> 00:21:53,332
So? You can have pancakes any damn time
of the night you want.

328
00:21:53,475 --> 00:21:55,773
-Come on, you want some breakfast?
-Sure.

329
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,642
''lt was an improbable romance.

330
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:04,480
He was a country boy.
She was from the city.

331
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,381
She had the world at her feet...

332
00:22:06,522 --> 00:22:09,150
...while he didn't have two dimes
to rub together.''

333
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:15,119
Noah, come on!

334
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:19,391
Look at them.

335
00:22:22,137 --> 00:22:23,263
What are we doing?

336
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:25,839
You think in another life
I could have been a bird?

337
00:22:28,277 --> 00:22:29,301
What do you mean?

338
00:22:29,712 --> 00:22:31,270
Like reincarnation.

339
00:22:32,648 --> 00:22:33,876
I don't know.

340
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,742
I think I could.

341
00:22:42,691 --> 00:22:43,919
Say I'm a bird.

342
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:45,916
No.

343
00:22:46,462 --> 00:22:48,487
-Don't do it.
-Say I'm a bird.

344
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,757
-Stop it. Stop it, now.
-Say it.

345
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:52,491
-You're not.
-Say it!

346
00:22:54,203 --> 00:22:55,465
You're a bird.

347
00:23:02,644 --> 00:23:04,407
Now, say you're a bird too.

348
00:23:07,182 --> 00:23:08,649
If you're a bird, I'm a bird.

349
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:44,776
-Come on, darling.
-What are you doing?

350
00:23:57,232 --> 00:23:59,063
On the count of three, okay?

351
00:23:59,201 --> 00:24:01,226
Real easy. On three. Ready?

352
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,837
One.

353
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:04,871
-Two.
-Two.

354
00:24:05,007 --> 00:24:06,770
-Three!
-No! I can't.

355
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:08,206
Get in the water.

356
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:10,176
-Come on, chicken.
-Get in!

357
00:24:10,312 --> 00:24:13,042
I'm sorry. Get in the water, baby.
Baby, would you get in.

358
00:24:13,182 --> 00:24:14,911
-Get in the water!
-I can't.

359
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,574
-Just go!
-Get in the water!

360
00:24:16,718 --> 00:24:17,685
-One!
-Jump.

361
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,084
-Two.
-Three!

362
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:36,063
No, no, no. Get to a good place
and move!

363
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:37,797
And keep it!

364
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,534
I don't understand
what you're talking about!

365
00:24:41,143 --> 00:24:42,701
''They didn't agree on much.

366
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:45,109
ln fact, they rarely agreed
on anything.

367
00:24:45,247 --> 00:24:47,010
They fought all the time.

368
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:49,674
And they challenged
each other every day.

369
00:24:50,252 --> 00:24:54,848
But despite their differences they had
one important thing in common.

370
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,390
They were crazy about each other.''

371
00:24:59,595 --> 00:25:00,823
Okay, I have to go.

372
00:25:00,963 --> 00:25:03,158
-No!
-Yes, I do.

373
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:17,869
Allie.

374
00:25:18,113 --> 00:25:19,137
Daddy.

375
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:23,550
Oh, Daddy, you--I didn't see you there.

376
00:25:24,353 --> 00:25:25,513
You kind of scared me.

377
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,056
Awful friendly
with that boy down there.

378
00:25:33,495 --> 00:25:34,826
Yes.

379
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:38,093
You bring him to the house on Sunday.

380
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:40,030
I want to meet this young man.

381
00:25:42,237 --> 00:25:43,465
Night, Daddy.

382
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:45,197
Good night.

383
00:25:52,314 --> 00:25:53,474
Oh, boy.

384
00:25:53,949 --> 00:25:56,713
This boy goes, ''Daddy,
I don't understand.'' He goes, ''Well...

385
00:25:56,852 --> 00:25:59,082
...in theory,
we're both millionaires...

386
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:02,019
...but in reality we live
with a bunch of whores.''

387
00:26:06,495 --> 00:26:07,689
Bishop Stevens told me that.

388
00:26:07,829 --> 00:26:11,196
Olivia, remove the liquor decanter from
in front of my husband.

389
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,960
He's had a little too much to drink.

390
00:26:15,604 --> 00:26:17,401
So, what do you do, Noah?

391
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:20,433
I work at the lumberyard with Fin.

392
00:26:20,742 --> 00:26:24,803
Mainly milling and receiving logs
and stripping the bark.

393
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:27,345
That's lovely, dear.

394
00:26:27,482 --> 00:26:27,971
Thank you.

395
00:26:28,116 --> 00:26:31,051
If you don't mind my asking,
how much do you earn?

396
00:26:31,186 --> 00:26:33,347
How much money do I make?

397
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:36,684
Forty cents an hour.

398
00:26:40,228 --> 00:26:40,990
Yeah, it's not much,

399
00:26:41,129 --> 00:26:45,065
but I don't need a lot
and I save most of it.

400
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:48,635
Let's eat, shall we?

401
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,238
Oh, yes! Oh, it looks delicious.

402
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:56,742
So, Noah, you and Allie been spending
a lot of time together.

403
00:26:58,814 --> 00:27:00,782
Must be very fond of each other.

404
00:27:02,951 --> 00:27:04,509
lt's getting pretty serious, huh?

405
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:07,410
Yes, ma'am.

406
00:27:08,023 --> 00:27:09,923
Well, summer's almost gone.

407
00:27:10,492 --> 00:27:11,823
What will you do?

408
00:27:12,127 --> 00:27:14,493
Charleston's only a couple
of hours away.

409
00:27:17,032 --> 00:27:18,829
But Allie's going to Sarah Lawrence.

410
00:27:20,636 --> 00:27:22,069
Didn't she tell you?

411
00:27:22,437 --> 00:27:24,098
No, she didn't tell me that.

412
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,968
I just got the letter.
I was going to tell you.

413
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:30,078
lt's okay.

414
00:27:31,113 --> 00:27:32,705
And Sarah Lawrence is in New York.

415
00:27:37,486 --> 00:27:38,510
I didn't know that.

416
00:27:39,621 --> 00:27:42,886
Anne, this conversation's too stuffy
for the dinner table.

417
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:44,324
Let the children have fun

418
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:47,223
and no bringing
in the Spanish lnquisition.

419
00:27:47,562 --> 00:27:49,325
My lips are buttoned right now.

420
00:27:49,464 --> 00:27:53,662
I do know another joke about the nun
and the four stallions.

421
00:27:54,136 --> 00:27:57,003
Stop it. I'm leaving the table
if you tell another joke.

422
00:28:00,842 --> 00:28:03,174
Going to do it! Yeah!

423
00:28:03,512 --> 00:28:05,036
-No!
-Ready!

424
00:28:10,285 --> 00:28:13,482
That child's got too much spirit for a
girl of her circumstance.

425
00:28:13,622 --> 00:28:15,749
No, it's just a summer love.

426
00:28:15,891 --> 00:28:17,916
Trouble is what it is.

427
00:28:42,984 --> 00:28:44,281
Is that Allie out there?

428
00:28:48,156 --> 00:28:49,316
Do you want to go somewhere?

429
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:58,788
Wait here.

430
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:20,820
Allie!

431
00:29:23,225 --> 00:29:24,192
Come on.

432
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,056
All right. Big step.

433
00:29:30,699 --> 00:29:31,961
Step. No, don't--

434
00:29:34,035 --> 00:29:35,366
All right, stay there.

435
00:29:36,371 --> 00:29:37,531
Don't open your eyes.

436
00:29:47,082 --> 00:29:48,310
The Windsor Plantation.

437
00:29:49,217 --> 00:29:51,378
lt was built in 1 772.

438
00:29:51,887 --> 00:29:57,587
Rumor has it that Francis Marion
proposed to his wife on these steps.

439
00:29:59,361 --> 00:30:02,194
Watch out. Be careful.
These are broken. Look at that.

440
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:06,095
This place is gigantic.

441
00:30:06,234 --> 00:30:07,997
Yeah, a gigantic piece of crap.

442
00:30:09,237 --> 00:30:10,204
lt is.

443
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:13,139
But I'm going to buy it one day.
I'm going to fix it up.

444
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,604
All it needs is a new floor.

445
00:30:16,645 --> 00:30:19,705
-And new walls and roof.
-Is that all?

446
00:30:19,848 --> 00:30:21,941
And plumbing and electric.

447
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,347
-And furniture.
-Yeah, and some furniture.

448
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:26,053
But it's right on the water.

449
00:30:26,188 --> 00:30:29,555
And there's a big old barn up there.
I could turn that into my workshop.

450
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:34,090
Well, what about me? Now,
don't I get any say in this?

451
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:37,230
Do you want a say in this?

452
00:30:37,632 --> 00:30:38,894
Yes, I would.

453
00:30:40,402 --> 00:30:41,426
What do you want?

454
00:30:41,803 --> 00:30:45,398
I want a white house
with blue shutters...

455
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,475
...and a room overlooking the river
so I could paint.

456
00:30:49,744 --> 00:30:51,075
-Anything else?
-Yes.

457
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:54,778
I want a big old porch that wraps
around the entire house.

458
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:58,010
And we can drink tea
and watch the sun go down.

459
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:05,123
-You promise?
-I promise.

460
00:31:05,827 --> 00:31:06,555
Good.

461
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:09,724
-Where you going?
-ln here.

462
00:31:59,881 --> 00:32:02,748
I can't play ''Chopsticks''
with you doing that.

463
00:32:25,473 --> 00:32:26,838
Make love to me.

464
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:22,851
-Noah?
-Yeah?

465
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,760
I know I said that
I wanted you to make love to me...

466
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:30,990
...but I think you're going
to have to talk me through this.

467
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:35,926
-Really? Everything?
-Yeah.

468
00:34:36,071 --> 00:34:37,698
-Did I hurt you?
-No, no.

469
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,137
I'm just--
I'm just having a lot of thoughts.

470
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:41,640
I'm just--

471
00:34:44,012 --> 00:34:45,138
Never mind.

472
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,283
Like, what are you thinking?
What are you thinking right now?

473
00:34:54,422 --> 00:34:56,413
You know, right this second.

474
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:01,351
Did you know that this would happen
when you brought me here?

475
00:35:02,063 --> 00:35:03,052
-No.
-No?

476
00:35:03,198 --> 00:35:05,166
No? You didn't think about it?

477
00:35:06,768 --> 00:35:09,032
-Of course I thought about it.
-You did?

478
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,637
Well, what did you think?

479
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,632
I'm talking too much, aren't l?

480
00:35:13,775 --> 00:35:16,209
Okay, I'm just going to shut up.

481
00:35:16,878 --> 00:35:17,970
Mum's the word.

482
00:35:20,982 --> 00:35:22,609
-You all right?
-Yeah.

483
00:35:24,586 --> 00:35:25,553
All right.

484
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:29,256
I just don't understand
how come you're so quiet.

485
00:35:29,924 --> 00:35:31,824
You don't have one thought?

486
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,260
I'm going crazy over here,
but, Noah, with you, everything's fine.

487
00:35:36,397 --> 00:35:38,422
You don't have a care in the world?

488
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:47,774
Sorry.

489
00:35:48,243 --> 00:35:52,111
I wanted this to be so perfect
and now I can't shut up.

490
00:35:55,783 --> 00:35:57,216
I love you.

491
00:35:59,687 --> 00:36:00,619
Did you know that?

492
00:36:16,604 --> 00:36:17,730
I love you too.

493
00:36:33,922 --> 00:36:35,981
You don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

494
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:40,293
No. No, I want to. I do.

495
00:36:41,696 --> 00:36:42,890
Noah!

496
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:44,464
-Noah!
-What?!

497
00:36:44,866 --> 00:36:46,197
Fin, get out of here!

498
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:48,802
Sorry, but Allie's parents
are going crazy.

499
00:36:48,937 --> 00:36:51,064
They got all the cops looking for her.

500
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,214
-You sent the police for me?
-Yes.

501
00:37:06,354 --> 00:37:08,379
lt is 2 a.m. We sent the police.

502
00:37:08,523 --> 00:37:10,150
Thank God you're all right.

503
00:37:10,692 --> 00:37:11,659
Where you been?

504
00:37:11,793 --> 00:37:13,522
All this is my fault.

505
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:15,526
Would you give us a moment, please?

506
00:37:15,863 --> 00:37:17,956
Like to talk to my daughter.

507
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:20,530
Alone, young lady.

508
00:37:27,976 --> 00:37:30,911
-Thanks for everything, lieutenant.
-You bet, John. Anytime.

509
00:37:31,546 --> 00:37:34,014
You get straight home now. lt's late.

510
00:37:40,822 --> 00:37:44,258
Sir, it's really not her fault.
I lost track of time.

511
00:37:45,593 --> 00:37:46,582
Sit down.

512
00:37:57,872 --> 00:37:59,464
I'm sorry, Daddy.

513
00:37:59,607 --> 00:38:00,767
''I'm sorry, Daddy.''

514
00:38:00,908 --> 00:38:04,344
Think you can bat your eyelashes at
your father and get away with it?

515
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:08,279
No. This time there's going to start
being some rules around here.

516
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,212
Like what?

517
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,318
If your father won't enforce them,
I will.

518
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:12,350
Like what, Mother?!

519
00:38:12,487 --> 00:38:15,854
-You are going to stop seeing Noah.
-No.

520
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:18,015
She is out fooling around
with that boy till 2 a.m.

521
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:21,060
and it has got to stop.

522
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:25,655
I din't spend 1 7 years raising
a daughter and giving her everything...

523
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,893
...for her to throw it away
on a summer romance.

524
00:38:28,036 --> 00:38:30,630
She'll wind up broken-hearted
or pregnant.

525
00:38:30,772 --> 00:38:34,333
Now, he is a nice boy.
He's a nice boy, but he's...

526
00:38:34,475 --> 00:38:39,469
-He's what? He's what?! Tell me!
-He is trash! Trash! Not for you!

527
00:38:39,614 --> 00:38:42,378
-Trash?!
-He's a laborer. He's a woodworker.

528
00:38:42,517 --> 00:38:43,347
So what?!

529
00:38:43,484 --> 00:38:45,918
Are you going to live
in his father's house

530
00:38:46,054 --> 00:38:49,046
and pop out a few dirty kids?!

531
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,817
I wouldn't mind!

532
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:52,482
Don't touch me!

533
00:38:54,329 --> 00:38:56,456
You won't see him anymore. That's final.

534
00:38:56,597 --> 00:38:57,757
-No, it's not.
-Yes, it is.

535
00:38:57,899 --> 00:38:59,298
No, it's not final!

536
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:01,800
You're not going to tell me
who I'm going to love!

537
00:39:01,936 --> 00:39:05,463
-Love?
-Yes, Daddy, I love him.

538
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,130
I love him.

539
00:39:08,343 --> 00:39:10,504
He's not suitable for you, baby.

540
00:39:11,179 --> 00:39:15,047
I know he is not what you want for me.

541
00:39:15,183 --> 00:39:20,746
He's poor and unrefined and uncultured
and all wrong.

542
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:22,751
I love him.

543
00:39:24,025 --> 00:39:27,483
-I love him.
-You know nothing about love.

544
00:39:27,628 --> 00:39:29,459
Oh, and you do?!

545
00:39:29,597 --> 00:39:31,861
You don't look at Daddy the way
I look at Noah.

546
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:34,695
You don't touch or laugh.
You don't play.

547
00:39:34,836 --> 00:39:37,270
You don't know anything about love.

548
00:39:37,905 --> 00:39:38,894
Noah?

549
00:39:40,675 --> 00:39:41,642
Noah?

550
00:39:46,914 --> 00:39:47,881
You're leaving?

551
00:39:51,486 --> 00:39:54,182
I am so sorry.
I don't even know what to say.

552
00:39:54,322 --> 00:39:55,812
I'm humiliated.

553
00:39:56,491 --> 00:39:58,584
-lt's all right.
-No, it's not.

554
00:39:58,726 --> 00:40:01,194
-Yeah.
-No, it's not.

555
00:40:16,144 --> 00:40:19,113
-I'm going to go.
-No, I don't want you to go.

556
00:40:19,247 --> 00:40:22,478
-I got to think about some stuff.
-What do you got to think about, huh?

557
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:24,943
Come here. Talk to me.

558
00:40:25,453 --> 00:40:26,579
Talk to me.

559
00:40:26,721 --> 00:40:28,188
About what? You want to--

560
00:40:29,257 --> 00:40:30,451
You're going away.

561
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:33,252
You're leaving...

562
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:35,521
...and I'm staying here.

563
00:40:37,398 --> 00:40:39,059
I'm so happy that you're doing that...

564
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:41,962
...but you'll have
a million things to do.

565
00:40:42,103 --> 00:40:44,663
-You got so much ahead of you.
-Don't talk like that.

566
00:40:44,806 --> 00:40:45,864
lt's true.

567
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:49,465
I'm not going to have nice things,
fancy things.

568
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,075
lt doesn't--

569
00:40:52,146 --> 00:40:55,047
lt's never going to happen for me.
lt's not in the cards for me.

570
00:40:55,183 --> 00:40:57,276
-I don't have to go to school, okay?
-Yes, you do.

571
00:40:57,418 --> 00:40:58,908
-I can stay here
-No.

572
00:40:59,187 --> 00:41:00,620
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

573
00:41:00,755 --> 00:41:02,222
You can come with me.

574
00:41:03,658 --> 00:41:05,455
-To New York?
-Yes.

575
00:41:07,562 --> 00:41:09,154
what am I going to do in New York?

576
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:12,928
Be with me.

577
00:41:18,272 --> 00:41:19,330
Yeah.

578
00:41:22,777 --> 00:41:23,835
I don't know.

579
00:41:29,383 --> 00:41:31,943
We don't got to figure
all this out tonight, you know?

580
00:41:32,086 --> 00:41:34,748
WE'll finish out the summer
and see what happens.

581
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,924
Are you saying you want to break up?

582
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:40,586
I'm saying we see how it goes later on.

583
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:48,863
Are you breaking up with me?

584
00:41:52,006 --> 00:41:53,735
I don't see how it's going to work.

585
00:41:56,644 --> 00:41:57,633
I see.

586
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:01,410
Please don't do this.

587
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:03,281
You don't mean it.

588
00:42:04,585 --> 00:42:06,780
Oh, hell, well,
if you're going to do it,

589
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:08,980
then why wait until the summer ends?

590
00:42:09,123 --> 00:42:11,489
Why don't you just do it right now?

591
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,092
Come on.

592
00:42:14,629 --> 00:42:15,789
-Come on.
-What are you doing?

593
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,056
Do it!

594
00:42:17,198 --> 00:42:18,165
Do it!

595
00:42:18,299 --> 00:42:19,789
Do it right now!

596
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:21,026
Do it!

597
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,530
Stop it!

598
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:26,363
You know what?! I'll do it!

599
00:42:26,507 --> 00:42:28,805
lt's over! Okay?! lt's over!

600
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,940
-Come here.
-Don't touch me!

601
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,180
I hate you! I hate you!

602
00:42:34,315 --> 00:42:35,782
I'm going to go.

603
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,644
Why don't you just go now!

604
00:42:38,786 --> 00:42:39,912
Leave!

605
00:42:40,187 --> 00:42:42,155
Go! Go!

606
00:42:43,891 --> 00:42:46,519
No, no.
We're not really breaking up, are we?

607
00:42:46,661 --> 00:42:48,959
This is just a fight we're having...

608
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:52,031
...and tomorrow it'll be like
it never happened, right?

609
00:42:57,405 --> 00:42:57,962
Gone?

610
00:42:58,105 --> 00:42:59,333
Gone.

611
00:43:00,174 --> 00:43:02,836
-Well, she must've been devastated.
-She was.

612
00:43:03,477 --> 00:43:05,445
He was only trying to do
the right thing.

613
00:43:06,914 --> 00:43:12,011
But what he really should have done is
just told those parents to go to hell.

614
00:43:12,153 --> 00:43:14,986
Yeah, you're right. Probably should've.

615
00:43:17,191 --> 00:43:22,493
''The next day, Allie woke up to find
her world completely changed.''

616
00:43:29,637 --> 00:43:30,604
What's going on?

617
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:33,063
We're going home.

618
00:43:34,108 --> 00:43:35,473
We're going now?

619
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,440
We're not due to leave for another week.

620
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:40,809
Get dressed and have some breakfast.

621
00:43:40,948 --> 00:43:44,475
-Will will pack your things.
-I'd be happy to pack your things.

622
00:43:44,619 --> 00:43:47,087
I don't want you to touch my stuff.

623
00:43:47,221 --> 00:43:48,051
I'm not going.

624
00:43:48,189 --> 00:43:50,453
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

625
00:43:50,591 --> 00:43:54,550
Well, yes, Allie, you are going whether
you like it or not.

626
00:43:54,895 --> 00:44:00,060
Now, even if Aaron has to drag
you the whole way, you're going.

627
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:09,502
All right, let's go.
We have to have all these done by lunch.

628
00:44:09,644 --> 00:44:12,875
Quit standing around. Here we go.
Let's go! Come on!

629
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,687
Where's Noah?

630
00:44:20,821 --> 00:44:22,345
He's out delivering a load.

631
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:25,022
What's going on?

632
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,786
I'm leaving town.

633
00:44:26,927 --> 00:44:28,519
Leaving? When?

634
00:44:28,663 --> 00:44:31,063
Now. Right now. Like, today.

635
00:44:32,733 --> 00:44:34,894
I need you to tell Noah something.

636
00:44:35,036 --> 00:44:37,197
Tell him that I love him
and tell him that

637
00:44:37,338 --> 00:44:39,533
I'm sorry for everything, okay?

638
00:44:39,674 --> 00:44:41,574
Look...

639
00:44:41,709 --> 00:44:43,609
...I was up all night with him, Allie.

640
00:44:43,744 --> 00:44:45,234
I've never seen him so low.

641
00:44:45,379 --> 00:44:48,371
lt's over. Don't make it any harder
than it already is.

642
00:44:48,516 --> 00:44:50,814
No. No, it's not over.

643
00:44:50,985 --> 00:44:54,045
We had a fight last night.
We said some things we didn't mean.

644
00:44:54,188 --> 00:44:55,951
-But it's not over.
-lt is over.

645
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:58,217
Leave it alone. Let it go.

646
00:44:59,326 --> 00:45:02,227
I'm coming! Mama, I'm coming!

647
00:45:05,032 --> 00:45:06,499
Look...

648
00:45:06,634 --> 00:45:10,866
He understands.
lt's hard but he really does.

649
00:45:11,005 --> 00:45:13,132
When the summer's over,
it's time to go home.

650
00:45:13,674 --> 00:45:16,108
If he wants to talk to you,
he'll write. If not...

651
00:45:21,749 --> 00:45:26,880
Okay, can you just tell him that
I love him, then?

652
00:45:27,354 --> 00:45:28,548
Can you do that?

653
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:30,482
I'll tell him.

654
00:45:35,663 --> 00:45:36,687
Bye, Fin.

655
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,207
Go on.

656
00:46:35,022 --> 00:46:39,118
''Summer romances end
for all kinds of reasons.

657
00:46:40,027 --> 00:46:43,793
But when all is said and done,
they have one thing in common.

658
00:46:44,665 --> 00:46:46,462
They are shooting stars.

659
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:49,995
A spectacular moment
of light from the heavens.

660
00:46:50,137 --> 00:46:52,037
A fleeting glimpse of eternity.

661
00:46:52,406 --> 00:46:54,169
And in a flash...

662
00:46:54,308 --> 00:46:55,468
...they're gone.

663
00:46:57,378 --> 00:46:59,039
Noah was desperate.

664
00:46:59,413 --> 00:47:03,577
He wrote to Allie that he was sorry
and stupid for breaking up with her.

665
00:47:03,717 --> 00:47:05,810
He wrote to tell her that
he still loved her

666
00:47:05,953 --> 00:47:07,477
and he wanted to see her.

667
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:11,990
And that if she would write back,
he would come to wherever she was.

668
00:47:14,495 --> 00:47:19,626
He wrote one letter a day for a year.
365 letters.

669
00:47:19,767 --> 00:47:21,325
But they all went unanswered.''

670
00:47:21,468 --> 00:47:22,594
Hey, Fred!

671
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:24,760
Nothing?

672
00:47:25,206 --> 00:47:26,230
Sorry.

673
00:47:26,373 --> 00:47:27,738
All right, thank you!

674
00:47:28,475 --> 00:47:30,238
''Finally, after a year of silence...

675
00:47:30,377 --> 00:47:34,177
...he decided to put it all behind him
and start a new life.

676
00:47:34,548 --> 00:47:36,448
So he wrote a farewell letter.

677
00:47:36,584 --> 00:47:40,884
And he and Fin packed their bags
and headed for Atlanta.''

678
00:47:42,556 --> 00:47:46,014
Noah!

679
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,989
Come on! Listen to this!

680
00:47:48,128 --> 00:47:50,756
A state of war...

681
00:47:50,898 --> 00:47:53,332
...has existed...

682
00:47:53,467 --> 00:47:56,231
...between the United States and...

683
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,634
''--Constitution of the United States...

684
00:47:58,772 --> 00:48:01,935
...against all enemies foreign
and domestic.''

685
00:48:02,076 --> 00:48:04,544
''Noah and Fin enlisted together.

686
00:48:04,678 --> 00:48:08,444
And after two years of chasing Rommel
through the North African desert...

687
00:48:08,582 --> 00:48:12,313
...they were deployed
to Patton's 3rd Army in Europe.''

688
00:48:28,235 --> 00:48:29,327
Fin!

689
00:48:53,794 --> 00:48:55,261
''Do I contradict myself?

690
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,030
Very well then I contradict myself.''

691
00:48:58,165 --> 00:49:02,898
''Allie was in her third year of college
when she volunteered as a nurse's aide.

692
00:49:03,203 --> 00:49:07,503
To her, the broken men with shattered
bodies who filled the ward...

693
00:49:07,641 --> 00:49:09,074
...were all Noah...

694
00:49:09,209 --> 00:49:11,177
...or someone who fought beside him...

695
00:49:11,312 --> 00:49:14,543
...in the jungle
or a forzen snow-swept road.''

696
00:49:15,049 --> 00:49:17,415
Going to lift you up.
Ready?

697
00:49:18,252 --> 00:49:19,344
Good.

698
00:49:19,687 --> 00:49:20,745
There we go.

699
00:49:21,889 --> 00:49:23,379
We'll bring this leg over...

700
00:49:24,725 --> 00:49:25,851
...down.

701
00:49:25,993 --> 00:49:27,085
You okay?

702
00:49:28,595 --> 00:49:30,062
Miss...

703
00:49:30,331 --> 00:49:32,026
...can I ask you a question?

704
00:49:33,767 --> 00:49:35,735
I noticed that
you weren't wearing a ring...

705
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:40,636
...and I was wondering
if I could take you out.

706
00:49:41,608 --> 00:49:42,939
Excuse me?

707
00:49:43,077 --> 00:49:44,339
Oh a date.

708
00:49:46,981 --> 00:49:49,745
Now, before you go and say no...

709
00:49:49,883 --> 00:49:53,319
...I'll have you know that
I am an excellent dancer...

710
00:49:53,454 --> 00:49:56,890
...and my intentions
are completely dishonorable.

711
00:50:01,028 --> 00:50:04,759
Okay, Casanova, come on.

712
00:50:05,032 --> 00:50:08,866
Let's just get you better,
then we'll talk about a date, okay?

713
00:50:18,979 --> 00:50:20,412
Would you get a load of him?

714
00:50:23,384 --> 00:50:26,376
Oh, my gosh, he is dreamy.

715
00:50:26,754 --> 00:50:27,914
What is he doing here?

716
00:50:28,055 --> 00:50:30,182
He's staring at you.

717
00:50:30,858 --> 00:50:31,825
Oh, miss?

718
00:50:34,028 --> 00:50:35,495
I'm all better.

719
00:50:37,097 --> 00:50:38,530
Now, how's about that date?

720
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,136
''Allie was surprised how quickly
she fell in love with Lon Hammond.

721
00:50:49,043 --> 00:50:50,874
He was handsome, smart...

722
00:50:51,011 --> 00:50:53,844
...funny, sophisticated and charming.

723
00:51:02,222 --> 00:51:06,522
He also came from old Southern money
and was fabulously wealthy.''

724
00:51:11,298 --> 00:51:12,162
What?

725
00:51:21,775 --> 00:51:24,175
-We're going to dance.
-What's happening? Where are they going?

726
00:51:24,311 --> 00:51:26,745
-See you later, sweetheart.
-Look at that.

727
00:51:30,384 --> 00:51:32,944
I've been thinking about why
we shouldn't get married.

728
00:51:33,087 --> 00:51:35,578
I give up. Why shouldn't we get married?

729
00:51:35,722 --> 00:51:38,987
I couldn't think of anything at first.
Then it dawned on me.

730
00:51:39,126 --> 00:51:40,718
Your parents.

731
00:51:41,261 --> 00:51:45,027
-My parents?
-Absolutely. Dear old Mom and Dad.

732
00:51:45,566 --> 00:51:47,295
The problem is, is that they love me.

733
00:51:47,434 --> 00:51:50,062
-I'm the type they want you to marry.
-They do? Really?

734
00:51:50,204 --> 00:51:54,641
I'm wealthy, I'm from the South.
I've got a decent job.

735
00:51:54,775 --> 00:51:56,333
I'm an incredible dance.

736
00:51:56,477 --> 00:51:59,378
I'm a really smart guy.
You know, I'm very--

737
00:52:00,481 --> 00:52:03,507
-So, what's the problem?
-I like to think-- Just listen.

738
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:05,345
If you marry me...

739
00:52:05,486 --> 00:52:07,420
Now, listen close.

740
00:52:07,554 --> 00:52:08,782
If you marry me,

741
00:52:08,922 --> 00:52:12,517
you'll lose a lifelong battle
in defiance against them.

742
00:52:12,659 --> 00:52:15,093
-Oh, my goodness, what will we do?
-I do not know.

743
00:52:16,029 --> 00:52:18,088
Hey, man, you feeling all right?

744
00:52:18,232 --> 00:52:20,462
Hey, man, you feeling all right?

745
00:52:24,404 --> 00:52:25,336
You say:

746
00:52:35,082 --> 00:52:38,347
See, Allie, I think-- Damn it,
I think you have to marry me.

747
00:52:38,485 --> 00:52:39,850
I think you need to marry me.

748
00:52:39,987 --> 00:52:41,011
-I do?
-Yes, you do.

749
00:52:41,155 --> 00:52:45,683
If you do, your parents'll always know
the unhappiness that you feel...

750
00:52:45,826 --> 00:52:47,555
...for not being able
to disappoint them.

751
00:52:47,694 --> 00:52:51,687
-You may have overlooked a minor detail.
-And what's that?

752
00:52:51,832 --> 00:52:54,699
Well, you see,
you have to get their permission first.

753
00:52:54,835 --> 00:52:58,168
And I think you may have overestimated
their affection for you.

754
00:52:58,305 --> 00:52:59,203
Is that right?

755
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:00,863
Oh, I don't think so.

756
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:02,572
Why not?

757
00:53:02,709 --> 00:53:04,939
I asked them already and they said yes.

758
00:53:05,812 --> 00:53:07,245
What?

759
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:11,576
One more thing.

760
00:53:14,021 --> 00:53:15,045
I love you.

761
00:53:15,989 --> 00:53:17,388
Will you marry me, Allie?

762
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:20,849
I know I kid around a lot,
but I am crazy about you.

763
00:53:23,096 --> 00:53:24,358
Marry me?

764
00:53:24,731 --> 00:53:25,993
Make me the happiest man in the world?

765
00:53:28,702 --> 00:53:29,669
Yes.

766
00:53:29,803 --> 00:53:31,031
Yes. Yes.

767
00:53:35,342 --> 00:53:36,866
-I'll tell them.
-Where you going?

768
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,942
Mama!

769
00:53:42,082 --> 00:53:43,174
Stop th band.

770
00:53:43,517 --> 00:53:44,449
Excuse me.

771
00:53:44,585 --> 00:53:46,018
I'd like you all to know
this young lady

772
00:53:46,153 --> 00:53:48,018
and I are getting married!

773
00:53:55,429 --> 00:53:56,896
''She agreed with all her heart...

774
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:00,966
...but couldn't understand why
at the very moment she said yes...

775
00:54:01,101 --> 00:54:03,262
...Noah's face came to her mind.''

776
00:54:14,514 --> 00:54:15,981
Hey, look at you!

777
00:54:16,883 --> 00:54:19,317
Good to see you. Let me see you.

778
00:54:19,786 --> 00:54:21,344
You bleeding anywhere? No?

779
00:54:21,488 --> 00:54:22,682
-Everything good?
-Yeah.

780
00:54:22,823 --> 00:54:24,188
Oh, I love you.

781
00:54:26,193 --> 00:54:28,218
-There's something I got to show you.
-All right.

782
00:54:28,362 --> 00:54:29,056
Come on.

783
00:54:33,734 --> 00:54:36,635
what's going on? What is this?

784
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,102
Here.

785
00:54:38,772 --> 00:54:39,898
I sold the house.

786
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:42,399
You sold the house?

787
00:54:42,542 --> 00:54:44,942
Yep. Got to be out by the end
of the month.

788
00:54:45,078 --> 00:54:48,309
Between that and your GI Bill you ought
to be able to get it now.

789
00:54:48,949 --> 00:54:49,711
Get what?

790
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:52,045
Your dream house.
The Windsor Plantation.

791
00:54:52,185 --> 00:54:54,210
-Dad--
-I don't want to hear about it.

792
00:54:54,354 --> 00:54:56,686
I already talked to the bank.
They'll give you the loan.

793
00:54:58,158 --> 00:55:01,457
-Well, I can't let you sell your house.
-lt's done.

794
00:55:02,029 --> 00:55:04,088
lt's a good thing, you should do it.

795
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:14,272
Wait a second. You sell the house,
where you going to live?

796
00:55:14,408 --> 00:55:18,208
With you, dummy. Where do you think?
Somebody's got to help you fix it up.

797
00:55:27,454 --> 00:55:31,220
''Noah took a look at the house,
but only saw one thing:

798
00:55:31,992 --> 00:55:33,016
Allie.

799
00:55:34,394 --> 00:55:37,852
He decided right there
to fulfill his lifelong dream.

800
00:55:38,465 --> 00:55:41,491
He would rebuild the old house
from the ground up.

801
00:55:44,371 --> 00:55:48,899
And when Noah went to Charleston
to get the building plans approved...

802
00:55:49,042 --> 00:55:50,509
...fate stepped in...

803
00:55:50,977 --> 00:55:53,070
...and dealt him a sweet card.''

804
00:56:00,454 --> 00:56:01,546
Stop the bus!

805
00:56:02,255 --> 00:56:02,721
Stop the bus!

806
00:56:02,856 --> 00:56:05,256
I can't stop till I get to the depot.

807
00:56:05,392 --> 00:56:07,155
No. Please stop the bus now.

808
00:56:07,294 --> 00:56:12,027
You understand English? No one gets off
till we get to ghe depot. Sit down!

809
00:56:12,165 --> 00:56:13,655
God--

810
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,236
Move!

811
00:56:21,975 --> 00:56:22,873
What are you doing?!

812
00:56:28,048 --> 00:56:29,106
He's right over there.

813
00:56:47,267 --> 00:56:49,201
Baby. Hello.

814
00:57:14,094 --> 00:57:15,823
''After seeing Allie that day...

815
00:57:15,962 --> 00:57:18,157
...something inside Noah snapped.

816
00:57:19,065 --> 00:57:19,759
He got the notion...

817
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:24,530
...that if he restored the old house
where they had come that night...

818
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:27,231
...Allie would find a way
to come back to him.

819
00:57:28,108 --> 00:57:30,508
Some called it a labor of love.

820
00:57:30,844 --> 00:57:32,869
Others called it something else.

821
00:57:33,013 --> 00:57:36,540
But in fact, Noah had gone a little mad.

822
00:57:37,651 --> 00:57:39,084
-When--''
-Excuse me?

823
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:41,414
lt's time to eat.

824
00:57:41,755 --> 00:57:44,223
Lunch is in the sun room today.

825
00:57:46,193 --> 00:57:48,923
The melon is good. I had a bite.

826
00:57:49,996 --> 00:57:51,827
Do they ever see each other again?

827
00:57:52,566 --> 00:57:53,897
Noah and Allie?

828
00:57:54,734 --> 00:57:59,637
You don't want me to spoil the end
before I get to the good part, do you?

829
00:58:00,874 --> 00:58:02,933
Where did I leave off?

830
00:58:03,343 --> 00:58:04,310
''I shall not want...''

831
00:58:04,444 --> 00:58:06,844
''When Noah's father died in November...

832
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,880
...the house was all he had.

833
00:58:29,436 --> 00:58:32,166
ln time, Noah finished the house.''

834
00:58:32,305 --> 00:58:33,602
Smile. Here we go.

835
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:38,774
''He took a good look at what
he had accomplished...

836
00:58:38,912 --> 00:58:41,813
...got rip-roaring drunk for 10 days...

837
00:58:41,948 --> 00:58:44,508
...thought seriously
about setting it on fire...

838
00:58:44,918 --> 00:58:47,011
...and finally put the house up
for sale.''

839
00:58:47,153 --> 00:58:49,553
I'm prepared to offer you this much.

840
00:58:50,824 --> 00:58:52,849
''He had a number of interested buyers.

841
00:58:52,993 --> 00:58:55,962
But he always found a reason
not to sell it to them.''

842
00:58:56,096 --> 00:58:57,154
No.

843
00:58:57,297 --> 00:58:59,424
''Either their bids were too low...

844
00:58:59,566 --> 00:59:04,060
...or if they met his asking price,
he felt it was worth a lot more.''

845
00:59:04,337 --> 00:59:05,861
lt's a lot of money...

846
00:59:06,006 --> 00:59:07,530
...but I'll take it.

847
00:59:10,277 --> 00:59:11,938
Fifty thousand dollars.

848
00:59:12,078 --> 00:59:13,602
That's more than my asking price.

849
00:59:13,747 --> 00:59:17,046
That's right. lt's a great deal more.

850
00:59:21,121 --> 00:59:24,557
''He told the man that offered him $5000
over his price...

851
00:59:24,691 --> 00:59:27,489
...that no one in his right mind
would do that...

852
00:59:27,627 --> 00:59:30,721
...and he wouldn't have a lunatic
living in his house.

853
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:37,099
He worked out his frustration with life
on the creek every morning.

854
00:59:38,405 --> 00:59:41,897
And in the evenings,
to temper ths ting of loneliness...

855
00:59:42,042 --> 00:59:43,669
...there was Martha Shaw.

856
00:59:44,711 --> 00:59:48,579
Martha was a war widow who lived
in Quail Ridge, a town away.''

857
00:59:53,386 --> 00:59:55,547
So you want to go out to eat tomorrow?

858
00:59:55,956 --> 00:59:57,548
I got to work.

859
00:59:57,691 --> 00:59:59,852
We can go down to the river if you want.

860
00:59:59,993 --> 01:00:01,585
Next week sometime.

861
01:00:01,928 --> 01:00:03,691
Maybe we could take a drive somewhere.

862
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:04,990
No.

863
01:00:05,632 --> 01:00:07,964
Well, I'm just asking you.

864
01:00:19,312 --> 01:00:20,609
What do you want, Noah?

865
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:26,013
What do you mean what do I want?

866
01:00:28,588 --> 01:00:29,953
From me.

867
01:00:35,629 --> 01:00:38,530
sometimes when you talk to me
you don't even see me.

868
01:00:43,436 --> 01:00:47,497
Look, a woman knows when a man looks
into her eyes and sees someone else.

869
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:57,377
Now, you know I want to give you
all the things that you want.

870
01:00:59,252 --> 01:01:00,412
Right?

871
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:06,156
But I can't...

872
01:01:08,194 --> 01:01:09,923
...because they are gone.

873
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:13,725
They're broken.

874
01:01:17,237 --> 01:01:18,226
All right?

875
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:43,853
Is the veil too much?

876
01:01:43,997 --> 01:01:46,124
Are you kidding? You look perfect.

877
01:01:46,266 --> 01:01:48,234
You're the most beautiful bride.

878
01:01:50,837 --> 01:01:52,896
-You look gorgeous, honey.
-Thank you.

879
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:57,135
Wait until Lon sees you in this dress.
He's going to go crazy!

880
01:01:57,277 --> 01:01:59,245
He won't be able
to take his eyes off you.

881
01:01:59,379 --> 01:02:00,778
Or his hands.

882
01:02:00,914 --> 01:02:02,711
Oh, you are so bad.

883
01:02:02,849 --> 01:02:04,339
Have you seen this morning's paper?

884
01:02:04,484 --> 01:02:08,818
The Daily Journal says you are going to
be the social highlight of the season.

885
01:02:08,955 --> 01:02:09,785
The season?

886
01:02:09,923 --> 01:02:12,551
This'll be a celebration the lokes of
which this town had never seen!

887
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:16,793
She doesn't plan,
she plots, doesn't she?

888
01:02:18,064 --> 01:02:19,759
Mana, look, the governor's coming.

889
01:02:19,899 --> 01:02:21,457
He better. Letme see.

890
01:02:25,038 --> 01:02:26,164
Oh, boy.

891
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,134
-Savannah, where are we at?
-We're at 82 now.

892
01:03:04,477 --> 01:03:06,411
-Memphis, where are we at?
-We're at 89.

893
01:03:06,546 --> 01:03:07,808
-Great. Up from 85.
-Sir?

894
01:03:07,947 --> 01:03:09,676
-Yes?
-You have a visitor.

895
01:03:11,518 --> 01:03:13,782
Well, hello.
Baby, I didn't know you were coming.

896
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,014
I'm so sorry. I should've called.

897
01:03:17,157 --> 01:03:19,352
What are you talking about?
You don't have to call.

898
01:03:20,627 --> 01:03:22,925
-Guys, could you give us a minute?
-Yes, sir.

899
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:25,361
-Miss Allie.
-Ma'am.

900
01:03:31,771 --> 01:03:32,795
So, what's up?

901
01:03:36,009 --> 01:03:37,567
I don't paint anymore.

902
01:03:38,745 --> 01:03:42,909
I used to paint all the time
and I really loved it.

903
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:44,482
I didn't know that.

904
01:03:44,617 --> 01:03:45,709
Yeah.

905
01:03:48,254 --> 01:03:49,414
So paint.

906
01:03:50,089 --> 01:03:51,021
I will.

907
01:03:51,624 --> 01:03:53,785
Yeah, I'm going to start.

908
01:03:55,528 --> 01:03:56,460
Great.

909
01:04:02,602 --> 01:04:03,534
Is everything okay?

910
01:04:06,906 --> 01:04:08,533
I need to get away.

911
01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:10,798
Okay.

912
01:04:11,144 --> 01:04:15,604
I need to take care of a few things.
I need to clear my head.

913
01:04:15,748 --> 01:04:17,375
Okay, should I be worried?

914
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:19,683
No, I don't think so.

915
01:04:19,819 --> 01:04:21,684
Well, that's reassuring.

916
01:04:23,289 --> 01:04:27,225
-Listen, are you all right?
-Yeah.

917
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:31,888
Okay. Then go. Take your time.
Do whatever you need to do.

918
01:04:32,031 --> 01:04:33,328
lt's okay to be nervous.

919
01:04:33,466 --> 01:04:35,457
lt's normal to get cold feet
before your wedding.

920
01:04:35,602 --> 01:04:38,765
No. No second thoughts, Lon.

921
01:04:42,742 --> 01:04:43,834
I love you.

922
01:04:44,577 --> 01:04:47,944
And I'm going to be back from Seabrook
in a couple of days, Okay?

923
01:04:48,715 --> 01:04:50,148
Seabrook.

924
01:04:50,283 --> 01:04:51,944
Yeah. Seabrook.

925
01:05:38,765 --> 01:05:39,754
Hello.

926
01:05:44,404 --> 01:05:46,599
I waw your picture in the paper.

927
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,035
The one with you and the house.

928
01:05:49,175 --> 01:05:51,700
and I just wanted to come
and see if you were okay.

929
01:05:52,312 --> 01:05:55,110
I mean, I wasn't in the neighborhood
or anything. I just...

930
01:06:03,189 --> 01:06:04,486
So are you okay?

931
01:06:09,195 --> 01:06:10,093
Okay, good.

932
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:18,131
I'm a stupid woman.
I shouldn't have come.

933
01:06:39,459 --> 01:06:41,051
You want to come in?

934
01:06:41,194 --> 01:06:42,218
Okay.

935
01:06:45,999 --> 01:06:47,261
this is a good story.

936
01:06:47,867 --> 01:06:48,993
I'm glad you like it.

937
01:06:51,871 --> 01:06:53,099
I think I've heard it before.

938
01:06:55,141 --> 01:06:56,233
Yes.

939
01:06:57,477 --> 01:06:59,172
Perhaps more than once?

940
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:01,603
Doctor needs to see you.

941
01:07:01,748 --> 01:07:02,942
Me? Now?

942
01:07:03,082 --> 01:07:04,106
No. Him.

943
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:06,411
But he hasn't finished reading
the story.

944
01:07:06,552 --> 01:07:08,747
I'll read more
when I'm through with the doctor.

945
01:07:08,888 --> 01:07:10,913
lt shouldn't take too long.

946
01:07:11,057 --> 01:07:13,787
-All right.
-Don't you go away. I'll be right back.

947
01:07:16,029 --> 01:07:18,896
While you waiting,
maybe you'd like to play the piano.

948
01:07:19,032 --> 01:07:20,522
You do like that.

949
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:21,564
I do?

950
01:07:23,002 --> 01:07:24,128
I don't know any tunes.

951
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:25,897
You can read music.

952
01:07:26,305 --> 01:07:27,829
No kidding.

953
01:07:33,479 --> 01:07:34,446
Who are you?

954
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:37,549
I'm Dr. Barrwell,
one of the new attending physicians.

955
01:07:38,017 --> 01:07:40,952
We haven't met,
so I thought I'd examine you myself.

956
01:07:43,356 --> 01:07:45,221
Okay, so I see here that

957
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:48,452
you've had two heart attacks over
the last 18 months.

958
01:07:48,594 --> 01:07:51,062
Yeah, minor ones.
I think one was angina.

959
01:07:51,197 --> 01:07:52,129
Okay, any complications?

960
01:07:52,265 --> 01:07:53,892
Nope. Feel fine.

961
01:07:54,033 --> 01:07:55,500
Okay. Deep breath for me.

962
01:07:57,236 --> 01:07:58,863
Okay. One more time.

963
01:08:00,406 --> 01:08:01,873
And deep breath.

964
01:08:03,209 --> 01:08:04,642
And one more.

965
01:08:06,746 --> 01:08:09,579
Terrific. Terrific.
You still taking your medication?

966
01:08:09,715 --> 01:08:11,182
Every day, twice a day.

967
01:08:11,484 --> 01:08:14,385
Good, good, good, good, good.
Okay, you can put your shirt on.

968
01:08:20,059 --> 01:08:22,619
So I understand that
you read to Miss Hamilton.

969
01:08:22,762 --> 01:08:24,855
Yep. To help her remember.

970
01:08:26,499 --> 01:08:27,989
You don't think it'll help.

971
01:08:28,134 --> 01:08:29,795
No, I don't.

972
01:08:29,936 --> 01:08:35,374
She remembers, doc.
I read to her and she remembers.

973
01:08:35,508 --> 01:08:38,375
Not always, but she remembers.

974
01:08:38,511 --> 01:08:42,675
Senile dementia is irreversible.
lt's degenerative.

975
01:08:42,815 --> 01:08:45,613
After a certain point,
its victims don't come back.

976
01:08:45,751 --> 01:08:47,241
That's what they keep telling me.

977
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,283
I just don't want you
to get your hopes up.

978
01:08:49,422 --> 01:08:52,823
Well, thanks, doc.
But you know what they say:

979
01:08:52,959 --> 01:08:56,156
Science goes only so far
and then comes God.

980
01:08:56,629 --> 01:08:58,494
Then comes God.

981
01:09:00,633 --> 01:09:03,033
Damn, they forgot
to turn the page for her.

982
01:09:03,169 --> 01:09:04,659
You through with me?

983
01:09:23,489 --> 01:09:25,320
I guess they flipped that page.

984
01:09:25,892 --> 01:09:27,154
No.

985
01:09:27,793 --> 01:09:30,353
That, she's playing by memory.

986
01:09:31,597 --> 01:09:33,656
His name is Lon Hammond, Jr.

987
01:09:33,799 --> 01:09:34,731
Hammond?

988
01:09:34,867 --> 01:09:36,858
As in Hammond Cotton?

989
01:09:37,003 --> 01:09:38,971
As in Hammond Cotton.

990
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:41,502
Well, your parents must love him.

991
01:09:41,774 --> 01:09:43,639
He's a really good man, Noah.

992
01:09:43,776 --> 01:09:45,175
You'd really like him.

993
01:09:46,512 --> 01:09:47,604
You love him?

994
01:09:48,681 --> 01:09:49,909
Yeah.

995
01:09:50,249 --> 01:09:52,911
I do. I love him very much.

996
01:10:00,726 --> 01:10:01,920
Well, that's that.

997
01:10:02,195 --> 01:10:05,392
You marry Lon, and we can be friends.

998
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,526
Right?

999
01:10:09,435 --> 01:10:10,333
Right.

1000
01:10:15,775 --> 01:10:16,799
Are you hungry?

1001
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:19,338
You want to stay for dinner?

1002
01:10:31,691 --> 01:10:33,886
I have to warn you, I'm a cheap drunk.

1003
01:10:34,327 --> 01:10:36,818
Couple more of these and you'll be
carrying me right out of here.

1004
01:10:37,163 --> 01:10:38,027
Well, go slow, then.

1005
01:10:38,164 --> 01:10:39,961
I don't want to have to take advantage
of you.

1006
01:10:40,099 --> 01:10:43,398
You wouldn't dare. I 'm a married woman.

1007
01:10:43,669 --> 01:10:44,567
Not yet.

1008
01:10:51,344 --> 01:10:52,208
What?

1009
01:10:55,514 --> 01:10:57,277
Why are you looking at me like that?

1010
01:11:00,353 --> 01:11:01,547
Just memories.

1011
01:11:06,859 --> 01:11:07,826
This room.

1012
01:11:11,897 --> 01:11:12,864
This--

1013
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:14,832
Is this where--?

1014
01:11:15,768 --> 01:11:17,292
This is the room?

1015
01:11:33,052 --> 01:11:33,984
I'm full.

1016
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:35,284
Me too.

1017
01:11:39,392 --> 01:11:41,292
''O, how your fingers drowse me.

1018
01:11:41,594 --> 01:11:43,755
Your breath falls around me like dew.

1019
01:11:43,896 --> 01:11:46,956
Your pulse lulls the tympans of my ears.

1020
01:11:47,099 --> 01:11:49,567
I feel immerged from head to foot.

1021
01:11:49,702 --> 01:11:51,567
Delicious, enough.''

1022
01:11:53,406 --> 01:11:55,374
lt was real, wasn't it?

1023
01:11:57,143 --> 01:11:57,871
You and me?

1024
01:11:59,845 --> 01:12:03,713
Such a long time ago.
We were just a couple of kids.

1025
01:12:07,453 --> 01:12:09,887
But we really loved each other,
didn't we?

1026
01:12:18,664 --> 01:12:19,528
I should go.

1027
01:12:23,569 --> 01:12:24,593
Goodbye.

1028
01:12:27,139 --> 01:12:28,868
You think you could come back
tomorrow morning?

1029
01:12:29,608 --> 01:12:31,633
There's some place I'd like to show you.

1030
01:12:35,214 --> 01:12:36,112
Please?

1031
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:38,178
Okay.

1032
01:12:39,018 --> 01:12:39,848
Okay.

1033
01:12:52,965 --> 01:12:55,900
''She had come back into his life
like a sudden flame...

1034
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:58,766
...blazing and streaming into his heart.

1035
01:13:00,473 --> 01:13:01,872
Noah stayed up all night...

1036
01:13:02,007 --> 01:13:05,135
...contemplating the certain agony
he knew would be his...

1037
01:13:05,277 --> 01:13:06,801
...if he were to lose her twice.''

1038
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:11,648
Oh, I do wish I could figure out
the end of this story.

1039
01:13:11,784 --> 01:13:13,046
The children are here.

1040
01:13:14,487 --> 01:13:15,920
Children?

1041
01:13:16,322 --> 01:13:18,085
Not yours, his.

1042
01:13:19,325 --> 01:13:20,292
Do you mind?

1043
01:13:20,426 --> 01:13:21,984
Oh, I'd love to meet them.

1044
01:13:23,662 --> 01:13:25,994
-Come over here.
-Hi Daddy.

1045
01:13:26,132 --> 01:13:27,190
-How are you?
-Good.

1046
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:29,528
-How you doing, Maggie?
-Hi, Daddy.

1047
01:13:30,236 --> 01:13:32,204
Hi. I'm Allie.

1048
01:13:32,705 --> 01:13:34,502
-Hi, I'm Mary Allen.
-Mary Allen.

1049
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,437
-Nice to see you.
-Nice to see you.

1050
01:13:36,809 --> 01:13:37,867
-Hi.
-Hi.

1051
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:40,205
-Maggie.
-Maggie, how are you?

1052
01:13:40,846 --> 01:13:42,245
Hello there, honey.

1053
01:13:42,381 --> 01:13:43,678
Hi. Davanee.

1054
01:13:43,816 --> 01:13:46,444
-what a pretty name.
-Thank you.

1055
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:49,949
Oh, my. Thank you.

1056
01:13:51,924 --> 01:13:54,449
-And who's this?
-Edmond.

1057
01:13:54,593 --> 01:13:55,685
Hi, Edmond.

1058
01:14:07,373 --> 01:14:12,834
You know, I think I'll run on up
and take my afternoon nap. All right?

1059
01:14:12,978 --> 01:14:15,378
-Come on, honey. Let's go.
-There you go.

1060
01:14:15,514 --> 01:14:17,948
-All right. Good.
-Thank you.

1061
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:19,448
I'll read some more later.

1062
01:14:20,052 --> 01:14:21,349
All right. Thank you.

1063
01:14:22,555 --> 01:14:24,546
I'm so happy to meet you all.

1064
01:14:26,859 --> 01:14:28,520
-Goodbye.
-Nice to meet you.

1065
01:14:28,661 --> 01:14:30,561
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

1066
01:14:32,298 --> 01:14:33,890
She seems good today.

1067
01:14:34,033 --> 01:14:35,694
She is good.

1068
01:14:36,435 --> 01:14:38,335
I don't know,
there's something about today.

1069
01:14:39,738 --> 01:14:41,706
Maybe it's a day for a miracle.

1070
01:14:43,509 --> 01:14:44,601
Daddy...

1071
01:14:45,644 --> 01:14:46,770
...come home.

1072
01:14:47,379 --> 01:14:48,971
Mama doesn't know us.

1073
01:14:49,114 --> 01:14:52,641
She doesn't recognize you.
She'll never understand.

1074
01:14:52,785 --> 01:14:56,482
We miss you.
This is crazy, you living here.

1075
01:14:56,622 --> 01:14:59,318
Yeah. You know, we'll all help with Mon.

1076
01:14:59,458 --> 01:15:01,619
We can take shifts visiting.

1077
01:15:02,294 --> 01:15:05,161
Look, guys...

1078
01:15:05,297 --> 01:15:06,924
...that's my sweetheart in there.

1079
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:08,958
I'm not leaving her.

1080
01:15:10,603 --> 01:15:12,230
This is my home now.

1081
01:15:13,405 --> 01:15:15,396
Your mother is my home.

1082
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:22,906
-Hello?
-Hey there.

1083
01:15:23,048 --> 01:15:24,276
Hi.

1084
01:15:25,017 --> 01:15:26,211
Who is this?

1085
01:15:26,352 --> 01:15:27,785
lt's Lon. Who were you expecting?

1086
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:33,517
Nobody. I'm just surprised.
How did you find me?

1087
01:15:33,659 --> 01:15:35,149
Well, there's only one hotel
in Seabrook.

1088
01:15:35,294 --> 01:15:37,888
And when you didn't call, I got worried.

1089
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:41,022
Where have you been? Are you all right?

1090
01:15:41,367 --> 01:15:44,302
I feel like an idiot because I called
your hotel about a hundred times.

1091
01:15:46,405 --> 01:15:48,168
I'm fine.

1092
01:15:49,008 --> 01:15:51,033
-Anything you want to tell me?
-No.

1093
01:15:51,443 --> 01:15:52,467
No?

1094
01:15:52,611 --> 01:15:53,703
No.

1095
01:15:57,850 --> 01:15:58,817
Okay.

1096
01:16:01,654 --> 01:16:03,121
Lon, I love you.

1097
01:16:03,656 --> 01:16:05,021
Call you tomorrow?

1098
01:16:06,025 --> 01:16:06,992
Okay.

1099
01:16:38,657 --> 01:16:39,521
Noah?!

1100
01:16:40,793 --> 01:16:41,521
Noah?!

1101
01:16:58,544 --> 01:16:59,340
Hey there.

1102
01:17:05,818 --> 01:17:07,718
Well, we better get going.
The rain's coming in.

1103
01:17:33,612 --> 01:17:34,601
You like it?

1104
01:17:41,687 --> 01:17:42,676
lt's like a dream.

1105
01:17:44,523 --> 01:17:46,150
Do you want to feed them?

1106
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:47,417
Yeah.

1107
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:06,372
What are they all doing here?

1108
01:18:08,347 --> 01:18:09,541
I don't know.

1109
01:18:10,382 --> 01:18:13,317
They're supposed
to migrate to Wadmalaw Sound.

1110
01:18:13,619 --> 01:18:15,143
They won't stay here?

1111
01:18:15,287 --> 01:18:16,219
No.

1112
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:19,721
They'll go back where they came from.

1113
01:18:32,504 --> 01:18:33,528
You're different.

1114
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,166
What do you mean?

1115
01:18:37,643 --> 01:18:39,167
Just the way you look.

1116
01:18:39,678 --> 01:18:40,906
Everything.

1117
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:43,512
You look different too,
but in a good way.

1118
01:18:49,621 --> 01:18:51,111
You know,
you're kind of the same, though.

1119
01:18:53,258 --> 01:18:54,384
Yeah?

1120
01:18:55,594 --> 01:18:56,424
Yeah.

1121
01:18:59,331 --> 01:19:00,696
And you really did it.

1122
01:19:01,834 --> 01:19:02,698
What?

1123
01:19:03,001 --> 01:19:03,797
Everything.

1124
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:05,837
The house.

1125
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:09,703
lt's beautiful what you did.

1126
01:19:13,178 --> 01:19:14,975
Well, I promised you I would.

1127
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:26,122
Great.

1128
01:19:27,893 --> 01:19:29,019
We got to go.

1129
01:20:00,392 --> 01:20:01,324
Noah!

1130
01:20:54,313 --> 01:20:55,803
Why didn't you write me?

1131
01:20:57,249 --> 01:20:58,238
Why?

1132
01:20:59,484 --> 01:21:01,179
lt wasn't over for me.

1133
01:21:01,653 --> 01:21:04,144
I waited for you for seven years.

1134
01:21:04,723 --> 01:21:06,623
And now it's too late.

1135
01:21:07,125 --> 01:21:10,253
I wrote you 365 letters.

1136
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:13,491
I wrote to you every day for a year.

1137
01:21:14,867 --> 01:21:16,664
-You wrote me?
-Yes.

1138
01:21:18,303 --> 01:21:19,565
lt wasn't over.

1139
01:21:21,273 --> 01:21:23,002
lt still isn't over.

1140
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:34,628
You got to be kidding me.

1141
01:23:36,742 --> 01:23:38,607
All this time,
that's what I've been missing?

1142
01:23:43,815 --> 01:23:45,077
Let's do it again.

1143
01:23:59,197 --> 01:24:00,357
Noah.

1144
01:24:21,987 --> 01:24:23,011
Noah.

1145
01:24:31,897 --> 01:24:32,955
Wake up.

1146
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:35,932
Wake up.

1147
01:24:44,342 --> 01:24:47,209
-Hi.
-You're trying to kill me, woman.

1148
01:24:53,452 --> 01:24:54,612
I need rest.

1149
01:24:55,754 --> 01:24:59,588
I need food so I can regain my strength.

1150
01:25:00,592 --> 01:25:01,524
Okay.

1151
01:25:02,527 --> 01:25:03,323
What do you want?

1152
01:25:09,034 --> 01:25:10,524
Some pancakes.

1153
01:25:11,336 --> 01:25:12,098
Okay.

1154
01:25:12,971 --> 01:25:14,996
And some bacon...

1155
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:16,837
Okay.

1156
01:25:17,275 --> 01:25:18,537
And some chicken.

1157
01:26:04,322 --> 01:26:05,949
She's the one, isn't she?

1158
01:26:12,697 --> 01:26:13,994
Can I meet her?

1159
01:26:17,202 --> 01:26:20,763
-I'd really like to meet her.
-l don't know if that's a good idea.

1160
01:26:23,542 --> 01:26:24,736
So this is Martha?

1161
01:26:26,077 --> 01:26:27,101
Hi.

1162
01:26:28,146 --> 01:26:29,306
I'm Allie.

1163
01:26:29,781 --> 01:26:31,305
I've heard a lot about you.

1164
01:26:32,284 --> 01:26:34,047
I've heard a lot about you too.

1165
01:26:34,953 --> 01:26:36,147
You want to come in?

1166
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:39,722
Are you sure?

1167
01:26:39,858 --> 01:26:43,726
Yeah. Yeah. Noah was just saying
how hungry he was.

1168
01:26:43,862 --> 01:26:45,796
You know you could put on a pot of tea.

1169
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:48,723
Come on in.

1170
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:53,462
Come on in.

1171
01:27:03,615 --> 01:27:06,106
-lt was nice meeting you, Martha.
-Nice meeting you too.

1172
01:27:06,418 --> 01:27:07,942
-Bye.
-Take care.

1173
01:27:28,006 --> 01:27:29,439
She's sensational.

1174
01:27:30,408 --> 01:27:31,602
She really is.

1175
01:27:32,711 --> 01:27:34,804
I'm really glad that I came, Noah.

1176
01:27:40,118 --> 01:27:42,086
I'd forgotten what it's like.

1177
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:48,851
For the first time since
I lost Richard...

1178
01:27:49,394 --> 01:27:52,557
...I feel like I've got something
to look forward to.

1179
01:30:10,902 --> 01:30:12,199
Lon is on his way here.

1180
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,740
I'm afraid your father spilled
the beans about Noah.

1181
01:30:17,876 --> 01:30:20,845
When Lon didn't hear from you again,
he decided to come.

1182
01:30:20,979 --> 01:30:22,241
Well, that's great.

1183
01:30:23,047 --> 01:30:23,945
That's just terrific.

1184
01:30:24,082 --> 01:30:27,142
You, me, Noah and Lon.
One big happy family.

1185
01:30:33,158 --> 01:30:35,126
Tell me about the letters, Mother.

1186
01:30:35,927 --> 01:30:36,791
Is it true?

1187
01:30:37,228 --> 01:30:38,320
Yes.

1188
01:30:39,798 --> 01:30:44,132
You watched me cry myself to sleep
for months and months...

1189
01:30:44,269 --> 01:30:46,294
...and you never said anything.

1190
01:30:47,038 --> 01:30:48,835
-How could you do that?
-I'm sorry.

1191
01:30:48,973 --> 01:30:50,304
-You're sorry?
-Yes, I am. I am sorry.

1192
01:30:50,442 --> 01:30:52,569
Because of you,
my entire life was ruined.

1193
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:54,837
Yes, I stole your letters. lt was wrong.

1194
01:30:54,979 --> 01:30:58,471
But stop being dramatic and at least
take some of the resposibility.

1195
01:31:00,218 --> 01:31:03,312
You came down here.
You knew what you were doing.

1196
01:31:03,455 --> 01:31:04,422
You knew this would happen.

1197
01:31:04,556 --> 01:31:05,921
so now I'm a tramp?

1198
01:31:06,724 --> 01:31:09,522
You are unbelievable. Unbelievable.

1199
01:31:14,432 --> 01:31:15,865
Come on. Get some clothes on.

1200
01:31:17,669 --> 01:31:18,897
Let's take a drive.

1201
01:31:19,237 --> 01:31:19,760
''Let's take a drive.''

1202
01:31:19,904 --> 01:31:22,065
Why would I want to go anywhere
with you?

1203
01:31:22,207 --> 01:31:25,176
Because I might know you
a little better than you think.

1204
01:31:26,578 --> 01:31:29,479
I don't want you waking up one morning
thinking if you'd known everything...

1205
01:31:29,614 --> 01:31:31,445
...you might've done
something different.

1206
01:31:45,997 --> 01:31:47,123
What are we doing here, Mama?

1207
01:31:49,634 --> 01:31:52,068
Do you see that man there?

1208
01:32:00,044 --> 01:32:03,070
Doesn't look like it now,
but 25 years ago...

1209
01:32:04,516 --> 01:32:07,349
Oh, my goodness.
He was really something.

1210
01:32:07,685 --> 01:32:10,313
We were out of our minds in love,
let me tell you.

1211
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:16,249
Wow.

1212
01:32:17,295 --> 01:32:19,126
Well, naturally your grandfather
was furious,

1213
01:32:19,264 --> 01:32:21,789
so we decided to run away.

1214
01:32:25,003 --> 01:32:28,495
We didn't even maked the next town
before the police picked us up.

1215
01:32:31,776 --> 01:32:32,868
But that was then.

1216
01:32:35,446 --> 01:32:38,142
You know, sometimes
when I'm in the area...

1217
01:32:38,516 --> 01:32:41,246
...I just stop here and watch him...

1218
01:32:44,022 --> 01:32:47,253
...trying to picture how different
my life might have been.

1219
01:33:01,639 --> 01:33:04,005
I want you to know that
I love your father.

1220
01:33:05,043 --> 01:33:05,600
Mama...

1221
01:33:05,743 --> 01:33:08,211
No, goddamn it, this is important
and you need to hear it.

1222
01:33:08,613 --> 01:33:11,946
I do. He is a wonderful man.

1223
01:33:12,083 --> 01:33:14,415
He is good to me,
and I don't deserve him.

1224
01:33:15,386 --> 01:33:17,718
I love him, Allie, I do. I love him.

1225
01:33:17,855 --> 01:33:19,379
I know you love him, Mama.

1226
01:33:21,459 --> 01:33:22,551
I know.

1227
01:33:27,599 --> 01:33:28,861
Oh, my God.

1228
01:33:31,669 --> 01:33:36,197
This is just very embarrassing.
I am a stupid woman.

1229
01:33:37,842 --> 01:33:39,639
Look at me, a big old bawl bag.

1230
01:33:43,414 --> 01:33:44,506
lt's crazy...

1231
01:33:52,924 --> 01:33:56,724
...but I don't even know
who that person is.

1232
01:34:05,403 --> 01:34:06,301
Oh, boy.

1233
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:46,708
Allie!

1234
01:35:04,295 --> 01:35:05,523
Here.

1235
01:35:10,201 --> 01:35:12,692
I hope you make the right choice.

1236
01:35:40,031 --> 01:35:41,123
lnteresting morning.

1237
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:43,231
Yeah.

1238
01:35:45,837 --> 01:35:47,236
Lon's here in town.

1239
01:35:50,475 --> 01:35:51,601
He's here?

1240
01:35:54,512 --> 01:35:57,879
Yeah we saw his car on the way,
at the hotel.

1241
01:36:08,526 --> 01:36:10,016
I see you got my letters.

1242
01:36:14,031 --> 01:36:14,895
Finally.

1243
01:36:22,874 --> 01:36:23,966
What are you going to do, Al?

1244
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:29,678
I don't know.

1245
01:36:37,588 --> 01:36:38,782
We're back to that?

1246
01:36:41,492 --> 01:36:42,720
Are we back there?

1247
01:36:44,996 --> 01:36:47,794
What about the past couple of days?
They happened, you know.

1248
01:36:47,932 --> 01:36:50,162
I know they happened
and they were wonderful.

1249
01:36:50,301 --> 01:36:52,462
But they were also very irresponsible.

1250
01:36:53,237 --> 01:36:56,695
I have a fiance waiting for me
who'll be crushed when he finds out--

1251
01:36:56,841 --> 01:37:00,436
So you make love to me
and then you go back to your husband?

1252
01:37:01,145 --> 01:37:02,635
Is that your plan?

1253
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:05,374
-Was that a test that I didn't pass?!
-No! I made a promise to a man.

1254
01:37:05,516 --> 01:37:06,915
I gave him my word.

1255
01:37:07,051 --> 01:37:08,916
Your word is shot to hell now,
don't your think?

1256
01:37:09,053 --> 01:37:10,850
I'll find out when I talk to him.

1257
01:37:10,988 --> 01:37:15,857
This is not about keeping your promise.
And it's not about following your heart.

1258
01:37:16,594 --> 01:37:17,720
lt's about sceurity.

1259
01:37:17,862 --> 01:37:19,727
-What is that supposed to mean?
-Money!

1260
01:37:19,864 --> 01:37:21,832
-What are you ta--?
-He has a lot of money!

1261
01:37:21,966 --> 01:37:23,831
-I hate you, you smug bastard.
-I hate you.

1262
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:25,162
If your leave here, I hate you.

1263
01:37:25,303 --> 01:37:28,170
Haven't you paid attention
to anything that's happened?

1264
01:37:28,306 --> 01:37:30,536
I guess not. I must have misread
all of those signals.

1265
01:37:30,675 --> 01:37:31,972
Yeah, I guess you did.

1266
01:37:34,846 --> 01:37:37,610
You're bored! You're bored
and you know it.

1267
01:37:37,748 --> 01:37:39,978
You wouldn't be here
if there wasn't something missing.

1268
01:37:40,618 --> 01:37:42,518
Arrogant son of a bitch.

1269
01:37:44,121 --> 01:37:45,713
Would you just stay with me?

1270
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:48,686
Stay with you? What for?
Look at us. We're already fighting.

1271
01:37:48,826 --> 01:37:52,284
Well, that's what we do. We fight.

1272
01:37:52,530 --> 01:37:54,293
You tell me
when I'm an arrogant son of a bitch.

1273
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:56,696
I tell you
when you're a pain in the ass,

1274
01:37:56,834 --> 01:37:59,462
which you are 99% of the time.

1275
01:38:00,137 --> 01:38:04,096
I'm not afraid to hurt your feelings.
They have a two-second rebound rate...

1276
01:38:04,242 --> 01:38:07,006
...and you're back doing
the next pain-in-the-ass thing.

1277
01:38:07,678 --> 01:38:08,235
So what?

1278
01:38:08,379 --> 01:38:11,314
So it's not going to be easy.
lt's going to be really hard.

1279
01:38:11,749 --> 01:38:15,480
We'll have to work at this every day,
but I want to because I want you.

1280
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:17,747
I want all of you forever.

1281
01:38:17,889 --> 01:38:19,857
You and me every day.

1282
01:38:19,991 --> 01:38:21,515
Will you do something for me?

1283
01:38:22,593 --> 01:38:23,491
Please?

1284
01:38:23,628 --> 01:38:25,892
Will you just picture
your life for me...

1285
01:38:27,098 --> 01:38:29,089
...30 years from now, 40 years from now.

1286
01:38:29,233 --> 01:38:30,427
What's it look like?

1287
01:38:30,801 --> 01:38:32,632
If it's with that guy, go.

1288
01:38:32,770 --> 01:38:36,001
Go! I lost you once,
I think I could do it again...

1289
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:38,608
...if I thought it's what
you really wanted.

1290
01:38:38,876 --> 01:38:41,936
-But don't you take the easy way out.
-What easy way?

1291
01:38:42,079 --> 01:38:45,139
There is no easy way.
No matter whta I do, somebody gets hurt.

1292
01:38:45,283 --> 01:38:47,683
Would you stop thinking
about what everyone wants?

1293
01:38:48,386 --> 01:38:51,913
Stop thinking about what I want.
What he wants. What your parents want.

1294
01:38:52,456 --> 01:38:53,616
What do you want?

1295
01:38:54,892 --> 01:38:56,883
-What do you want?
-lt's not that simple.

1296
01:38:57,028 --> 01:38:59,121
What do you want?

1297
01:39:01,599 --> 01:39:03,464
Goddamn it, what do you want?

1298
01:39:06,537 --> 01:39:07,504
I have to go.

1299
01:40:17,408 --> 01:40:19,603
My dearest Allie:

1300
01:40:19,744 --> 01:40:20,733
I couldn't sleep last night

1301
01:40:20,878 --> 01:40:23,039
because I know that
it's over between us.

1302
01:40:24,882 --> 01:40:28,181
I'm not bitter anymore because I know
that what we had was real.

1303
01:40:30,021 --> 01:40:34,583
If in some distant place in the future
we see each other in our new lives...

1304
01:40:34,725 --> 01:40:36,955
...I'll smile at
your with joy and remember...

1305
01:40:37,094 --> 01:40:39,562
...how we spent a summer beneath
the trees...

1306
01:40:40,431 --> 01:40:43,093
...learning from each other
and growing in love.

1307
01:41:01,018 --> 01:41:04,215
The best love is the kind that awakens
the soul...

1308
01:41:04,355 --> 01:41:05,982
...and makes us reach for more.

1309
01:41:06,857 --> 01:41:11,123
That plants a fire in our hearts
and brings peace to our minds.

1310
01:41:11,929 --> 01:41:13,453
And that's what you've given me.

1311
01:41:14,999 --> 01:41:17,467
That's what I had hoped
to give to you forever.

1312
01:41:18,536 --> 01:41:21,664
''I love you. I'll be seeing you. Noah.''

1313
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:24,266
lt's beautiful.

1314
01:41:25,609 --> 01:41:26,974
lt's a beautiful story.

1315
01:41:27,111 --> 01:41:28,305
Yes, it is.

1316
01:41:28,846 --> 01:41:31,406
I don't know why,
but it makes me feel sad.

1317
01:41:34,418 --> 01:41:37,512
I know you feel lost right now,
but don't worry.

1318
01:41:38,255 --> 01:41:41,156
''Nothing is ever lost or can be lost.

1319
01:41:41,525 --> 01:41:44,824
The body, sluggish, aged, cold...

1320
01:41:44,962 --> 01:41:48,728
...the embers left from earlier fires...

1321
01:41:48,866 --> 01:41:50,629
...shall duly flame again.''

1322
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:54,267
Did you write that?

1323
01:41:54,405 --> 01:41:55,565
No.

1324
01:41:55,706 --> 01:41:57,333
That was Walt Whitman.

1325
01:41:59,910 --> 01:42:01,468
I think I knew him.

1326
01:42:01,946 --> 01:42:03,311
I think you did.

1327
01:42:05,182 --> 01:42:08,276
Shall we go in?
I'm feeling a little chilly.

1328
01:42:11,255 --> 01:42:12,153
Thank you.

1329
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:23,999
Who did all of this?

1330
01:42:24,135 --> 01:42:28,196
I did, with a little help
from my friends on the nursing staff.

1331
01:42:43,287 --> 01:42:45,585
I've never seen anything so beautiful.

1332
01:42:46,891 --> 01:42:48,290
Neither have l.

1333
01:42:51,929 --> 01:42:53,089
Shall we?

1334
01:43:01,238 --> 01:43:03,138
-Some grape juice?
-I'd love it.

1335
01:43:06,010 --> 01:43:08,410
Wow, so many pills. How sick are you?

1336
01:43:09,079 --> 01:43:12,776
Well, ''sickness'' has
become a relative term for me.

1337
01:43:12,917 --> 01:43:17,377
I think of it now as more
a general wearing-out process.

1338
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:20,679
To you.

1339
01:43:29,433 --> 01:43:30,593
So, what happened?

1340
01:43:31,835 --> 01:43:33,063
ln the story?

1341
01:43:33,537 --> 01:43:35,061
Which one did she choose?

1342
01:43:42,746 --> 01:43:44,805
The way I see it, I got three choices.

1343
01:43:45,783 --> 01:43:47,751
One, I can shoot him.

1344
01:43:48,652 --> 01:43:51,120
Two, I can kick the crap out of him.

1345
01:43:51,622 --> 01:43:52,714
Or three...

1346
01:43:53,757 --> 01:43:55,247
...I leave you.

1347
01:44:00,931 --> 01:44:02,922
But all that's no good.

1348
01:44:05,269 --> 01:44:06,463
You see, because...

1349
01:44:08,539 --> 01:44:11,007
...none of those options give me you.

1350
01:44:13,877 --> 01:44:15,401
And in spite of everything...

1351
01:44:17,548 --> 01:44:18,674
...I love you.

1352
01:44:21,051 --> 01:44:22,177
I love you too.

1353
01:44:23,954 --> 01:44:26,286
I meant what I said
when I gave you that ring.

1354
01:44:26,490 --> 01:44:27,650
I did too.

1355
01:44:27,791 --> 01:44:28,758
I did too.

1356
01:44:28,892 --> 01:44:32,487
lt's just that when I'm with Noah
I feel like one person...

1357
01:44:32,630 --> 01:44:35,360
...and when I'm with you
I feel like someone totally different.

1358
01:44:38,302 --> 01:44:39,030
Look...

1359
01:44:39,570 --> 01:44:42,539
...it's normal not to forget
your first love.

1360
01:44:49,847 --> 01:44:50,939
I love you, Allie.

1361
01:44:52,383 --> 01:44:54,408
But I wnat you for myself.

1362
01:44:55,419 --> 01:44:59,378
I don't want to have to convince
my fiancee she should be with me.

1363
01:45:01,592 --> 01:45:02,991
You don't have to.

1364
01:45:04,161 --> 01:45:06,493
I already know I should be with you.

1365
01:45:08,732 --> 01:45:11,326
''And they lived happily ever after.''

1366
01:45:11,635 --> 01:45:12,693
Who?

1367
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:14,359
Who did?

1368
01:45:22,446 --> 01:45:23,913
Oh, yes.

1369
01:45:25,949 --> 01:45:27,473
Of course.

1370
01:46:09,393 --> 01:46:10,792
I remember now.

1371
01:46:13,664 --> 01:46:14,688
lt was us.

1372
01:46:15,666 --> 01:46:19,534
-lt was us. lt was us.
-Oh, my darling. Oh, my sweetheart.

1373
01:46:20,704 --> 01:46:23,138
I love you so much.

1374
01:46:25,008 --> 01:46:27,272
Oh, my baby.

1375
01:46:29,046 --> 01:46:31,776
Noah. Noah.

1376
01:46:31,915 --> 01:46:33,405
I love you, angel.

1377
01:46:36,153 --> 01:46:37,450
What happened to me?

1378
01:46:37,821 --> 01:46:41,120
Nothing.
You just went away for a little while.

1379
01:46:45,028 --> 01:46:46,518
How much time to we have?

1380
01:46:46,897 --> 01:46:47,886
I'm not sure.

1381
01:46:49,299 --> 01:46:51,767
Last time it was no more
than five minutes.

1382
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:58,567
Hey...

1383
01:46:58,709 --> 01:47:00,939
...I brought along an old friend.

1384
01:47:41,718 --> 01:47:44,448
-How are the children?
-Oh, they're fine.

1385
01:47:44,988 --> 01:47:49,288
They were here today.
Little Noah. Davanee too.

1386
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:51,587
They're getting so big.

1387
01:47:53,564 --> 01:47:54,588
Oh, boy.

1388
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:57,997
How fast the time goes.

1389
01:48:00,170 --> 01:48:01,637
Just flies right on by.

1390
01:48:01,772 --> 01:48:03,706
Oh, yes, it does.

1391
01:48:09,079 --> 01:48:11,013
Will you tell them I love them?

1392
01:48:12,216 --> 01:48:13,342
Of course I will.

1393
01:48:15,052 --> 01:48:16,383
And that I'm sorry.

1394
01:48:18,889 --> 01:48:20,550
I'll tell tem, sweetheart.

1395
01:48:33,937 --> 01:48:36,167
Remember that story
you were reading to me?

1396
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:37,932
Yes.

1397
01:48:45,415 --> 01:48:48,441
Do you think that
I could be her tonight?

1398
01:48:50,053 --> 01:48:51,145
Would that be all right?

1399
01:48:52,589 --> 01:48:54,181
You know what we could do?

1400
01:48:54,324 --> 01:48:57,191
Maybe we could get a car
and we could go for a ride.

1401
01:48:58,095 --> 01:49:02,031
We could get out of here,
just go someplace. You want to?

1402
01:49:02,533 --> 01:49:05,093
I don't think so. Not tonight, darling.

1403
01:49:05,235 --> 01:49:06,896
Come on. Why not?

1404
01:49:07,671 --> 01:49:09,036
Wait a minute.

1405
01:49:11,608 --> 01:49:13,542
Why did you call me darling?

1406
01:49:13,677 --> 01:49:15,076
I don't know you.

1407
01:49:15,212 --> 01:49:17,942
What's going on here?
Am I supposed to know you?

1408
01:49:18,081 --> 01:49:20,106
-Allie.
-No. No! No!

1409
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:21,581
Sweetheart.

1410
01:49:21,718 --> 01:49:24,710
-I love you. Stay with me. Don't leave.
-No!

1411
01:49:25,822 --> 01:49:29,314
-Who are you?
-I'm Noah. I'm Noah and you're Allie.

1412
01:49:29,459 --> 01:49:31,791
What do you want?
What are you doing here?

1413
01:49:31,929 --> 01:49:34,557
-Come on, baby.
-Don't come near me. Don't come near me.

1414
01:49:34,698 --> 01:49:37,929
-Allie, Allie...
-Help! Help!

1415
01:49:38,068 --> 01:49:39,729
-Help me!
-Calm down, Allie. Calm down.

1416
01:49:39,870 --> 01:49:41,667
Calm down. lt's all right, sweetie.

1417
01:49:41,805 --> 01:49:43,102
-lt's all right, baby. Come on.
-Leg me go!

1418
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:46,368
-Calm down, Allie.
-Leave me alone.

1419
01:49:46,510 --> 01:49:47,704
lt's all right. Doc!

1420
01:49:47,844 --> 01:49:50,836
-Somebody help me!
-Allie, calm down. Doctor!

1421
01:49:50,981 --> 01:49:53,211
-Talk to me.
-Hurry up. She's sundowning.

1422
01:49:53,350 --> 01:49:54,578
Somebody help me!

1423
01:49:54,718 --> 01:49:57,949
-Calm down. Get here arm.
-Okay, two cc's Halop--

1424
01:49:58,088 --> 01:50:00,386
-Calm down, Allie.
-One. Two.

1425
01:50:00,524 --> 01:50:01,650
Three.

1426
01:50:02,826 --> 01:50:03,986
Allie, it's all right.

1427
01:50:04,127 --> 01:50:07,324
-lt's all right.
-You're okay. Let's take a look.

1428
01:50:07,464 --> 01:50:10,297
-Let's take a look. Yeah, she's fine.
-Good.

1429
01:50:10,434 --> 01:50:13,494
-Just breathe. Stay calm.
-Just fine.

1430
01:50:13,637 --> 01:50:16,606
-Breathe in and out through your mouth.
-Relax.

1431
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:19,368
-You're going to be okay, Allie.
-Relax. lt's all right.

1432
01:50:19,509 --> 01:50:20,737
You're fine now.

1433
01:51:20,137 --> 01:51:21,570
Morning, Mr. Calhoun.

1434
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:24,739
Mr. Calhoun?

1435
01:51:26,710 --> 01:51:28,473
Call Dr. Fonatant at MUSC, okay?

1436
01:51:28,612 --> 01:51:32,810
I've got no BP, no pulse, nothing.
Let them know we're in full arrest.

1437
01:51:32,949 --> 01:51:34,780
-Call me on my cell!
-Okay, will do.

1438
01:51:53,570 --> 01:51:55,162
We talked about this.

1439
01:51:55,305 --> 01:51:57,364
lt's all right, now. Come on.

1440
01:51:57,507 --> 01:52:00,203
Come on, precious. Come on. Let's go.

1441
01:52:00,343 --> 01:52:04,473
lt's okay, baby.
Come on. You know Mr. Holmes.

1442
01:52:56,433 --> 01:52:58,833
Oh, Mr. Calhoun.

1443
01:52:59,469 --> 01:53:00,663
Welcome back.

1444
01:53:01,171 --> 01:53:04,607
-How do you feel?
-Fine. Fit as a fiddle.

1445
01:53:05,208 --> 01:53:06,698
Where you going?

1446
01:53:06,843 --> 01:53:09,835
I was just taking a walk. I can't sleep.

1447
01:53:10,781 --> 01:53:13,477
You know it's against the rules.

1448
01:53:13,617 --> 01:53:14,606
Yeah, I know.

1449
01:53:16,019 --> 01:53:18,749
You weren't really going for a walk,
were you?

1450
01:53:19,156 --> 01:53:21,147
You were going to see Miss Allie.

1451
01:53:22,726 --> 01:53:26,127
I just got out of the hospital
and I miss her.

1452
01:53:26,997 --> 01:53:28,726
Mr. Calhoun...

1453
01:53:28,865 --> 01:53:32,062
...I'm sorry but I can't let you
see her tonight.

1454
01:53:32,202 --> 01:53:34,830
You'll have to go back to your room.

1455
01:53:37,207 --> 01:53:38,640
As for me...

1456
01:53:38,775 --> 01:53:42,404
...I'm going to go downstairs
and get myself a cup of coffee.

1457
01:53:43,013 --> 01:53:45,675
I won't be back to check
on you for a while.

1458
01:53:46,049 --> 01:53:48,745
So don't do anything foolish.

1459
01:54:44,374 --> 01:54:45,602
Hi.

1460
01:54:55,318 --> 01:54:56,285
Noah.

1461
01:55:02,525 --> 01:55:03,617
Hi, sweetheart.

1462
01:55:05,262 --> 01:55:08,129
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to be here to read to you.

1463
01:55:09,799 --> 01:55:11,699
I didn't know what to do.

1464
01:55:12,402 --> 01:55:14,370
I was afraid you were never coming back.

1465
01:55:14,504 --> 01:55:16,438
Oh, I'll always come back.

1466
01:55:21,945 --> 01:55:24,641
What's going to happen...

1467
01:55:24,948 --> 01:55:28,509
...when I can't remember
anything anymore?

1468
01:55:29,986 --> 01:55:31,544
What will you do?

1469
01:55:31,955 --> 01:55:33,616
I'll be here.

1470
01:55:34,357 --> 01:55:35,654
I'll never leave you.

1471
01:55:45,835 --> 01:55:47,530
I need to ask you something.

1472
01:55:48,405 --> 01:55:49,895
What is it, sweetheart?

1473
01:55:54,678 --> 01:55:56,339
Do you think...

1474
01:55:57,714 --> 01:56:02,242
...that our love can create miracles?

1475
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:04,648
Yes, I do.

1476
01:56:06,756 --> 01:56:10,123
That's what brings you back
to me each time.

1477
01:56:18,368 --> 01:56:20,165
Do you think our love...

1478
01:56:21,538 --> 01:56:23,972
...could take us away together?

1479
01:56:30,413 --> 01:56:34,008
I think our love can do anything
we want it to.

1480
01:56:47,364 --> 01:56:48,353
I love you.

1481
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:51,499
I love you, Allie.

1482
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:10,143
Good night.

1483
01:57:11,588 --> 01:57:12,748
Good night.

1484
01:57:18,495 --> 01:57:20,156
I'll be seeing you.
