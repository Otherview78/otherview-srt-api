Our busiest day of the year.

The day hard-working
union members

21
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,301
get to turn their labor
into holiday joy.

22
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:03,908
Because tomorrow,
we put the "trust"

23
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,812
in San Diego Trust.

24
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:09,188
And that‘s it.
All right, that‘s it.

25
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,421
Nice. Powerful.

26
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:13,489
Yeah, great job.
Good stuff.

27
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,558
Right, back to work.
Back to work.

28
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:19,628
Right.

29
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:23,995
And what about the store?
Are you, are you getting by?

30
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,800
Had to let Terrance go.

31
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,132
But I still open
every day.

32
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,035
Not sure what else
to do with myself

33
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:33,675
now that Betty‘s gone.

34
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:41,110
Earl, I‘m...

35
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:43,684
I‘m really sorry,
but if you can‘t pay,

36
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:45,081
we‘re gonna have to foreclose.

37
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,626
I understand.

38
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,340
Okay.

39
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:04,133
What I can do

40
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:06,707
is I can hold on to
this paperwork
until after the holiday.

41
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,138
That should buy you
enough time
for Betty‘s Social Security

42
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:10,975
and retirement
to clear probate.

43
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:13,484
Now, I can‘t promise that
it‘ll save the store, but...

44
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:16,949
that should keep you
in your house.

45
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:19,919
I appreciate that.

46
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:24,660
Let me walk you out, okay?

47
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:29,400
I‘m so sorry again, Earl.

48
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:31,193
I mean, I can‘t even imagine

49
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:33,933
what it‘s like to lose someone
after 50 years of marriage.

50
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:37,310
Time don‘t matter.

51
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:41,545
Would‘ve hurt
just as bad if I lost her
the day we met.

52
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,384
She brought the sunshine
in my life.

53
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:49,014
Know what I mean?

54
00:04:50,554 --> 00:04:51,654
Yeah.

55
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:54,118
Totally.

56
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:16,579
Hey, Nate?
Oh.

57
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,010
Hi! Hey, what‘s up?
Oh, my God!
I‘m so sorry.

58
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:20,583
Oh, no. That‘s fine.
Jesus!

59
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:22,354
I can take care of that.
Holy shit.
I‘m sorry.

60
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,081
No, really,
you don‘t have to.

61
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:26,215
I‘m actually really good
at getting stains out.

62
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:27,821
You actually don‘t
have to. I‘m good.
I‘ll take care of it.

63
00:05:27,822 --> 00:05:29,757
I promise. Everything‘s--
Do not worry.

64
00:05:30,891 --> 00:05:32,189
I, uh...

65
00:05:33,762 --> 00:05:34,960
Uh, I...

66
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,599
I go-- I have to, uh, go.

67
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,733
Sorry.
Oh.

68
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:43,376
Real smooth, idiot.

69
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,137
Yeah, come in.
Hey.

70
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,139
Sherry! Hey! Hi.

71
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,273
Hi. Um...

72
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:54,485
Am I just so very fired?

73
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:56,080
I know I‘ve only worked here
for four months,

74
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:58,247
but I really feel like
I have a lot to contribute.

75
00:05:58,248 --> 00:06:01,283
No, no, you‘re not fired.
You‘re definitely not fired.
Are you sure?

76
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:03,120
Yeah.
I feel like I at least
owe you a new shirt.

77
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:06,530
Oh, this shirt? No.
No, no, no. This is...

78
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:09,126
It‘s the worst shirt I have.

79
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,161
Okay. Well, maybe
I could take you to lunch?

80
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,602
Uh, yeah.

81
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:14,032
Uh, no, actually.

82
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:16,002
Sorry, I brought mine today,
so I‘m okay.

83
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:18,674
Okay. Yeah. No pressure.

84
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:21,513
Okay.
But if you change
your mind, let me know.

85
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:23,878
Bye.

86
00:06:37,254 --> 00:06:39,255
Hey, uh...

87
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:40,433
You know what?

88
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:43,699
I‘m in.
Okay.

89
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,066
Cool. Leave in ten?
Yeah! Sounds good.

90
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:48,936
Looking forward to it!

91
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,905
Don‘t say that so loud.

92
00:06:57,714 --> 00:06:59,176
<i>Oh.
Welcome back, honey.</i>

93
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:01,211
I see you‘ve brought
a friend this time.

94
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,487
Yeah, this is Nate.

95
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,346
Hey there, Nate.
What can I get you?

96
00:07:04,347 --> 00:07:07,723
Oh, you know,
just a milkshake, please.
Vanilla milkshake.

97
00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:10,319
You don‘t want any food?
They have
really good sandwiches.

98
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,222
Really good sandwiches? Uh...

99
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,531
Nah. I‘m good.

100
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:17,161
Okay. Um...
Then I‘ll have--

101
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:19,537
Oh! Please tell me
you‘re not out
of the cherry pie.

102
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:21,198
It‘s your lucky day.

103
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,397
Got one left.
Oh, yes!

104
00:07:26,677 --> 00:07:28,074
So...

105
00:07:30,846 --> 00:07:32,078
what‘s your deal?

106
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,179
Uh...

107
00:07:35,147 --> 00:07:37,049
My deal?
Yeah.

108
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,523
You‘re just always, like,

109
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:39,986
I don‘t know, in your office

110
00:07:39,987 --> 00:07:41,856
and you never come out
to the happy hours.

111
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:45,893
I don‘t really know.
You know? I‘m, um...

112
00:07:45,894 --> 00:07:50,063
I guess I‘m just not really
a... very social person.

113
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,934
Okay.
Yeah.

114
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,773
Do you have a girlfriend?
No. No, I don‘t.
Um, not...

115
00:07:57,774 --> 00:07:59,401
Not right now.

116
00:07:59,402 --> 00:08:01,678
Are you on the apps?
No! God, no.

117
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,779
Why not? Really?
You‘d do great.

118
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,715
I could take
a profile picture
of you right now.

119
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:07,112
The reindeer tie would slay.

120
00:08:07,113 --> 00:08:09,082
Oh, okay. All right.

121
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,721
Thank you very much.

122
00:08:11,722 --> 00:08:14,560
Enjoy. Holler if
you need anything.

123
00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:16,089
Thank you.

124
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,961
Mmm!
Mm-hmm.

125
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:23,568
Oh, my God!
This is so good.
Cool.

126
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,131
Do you want some?
Oh, no, I‘m okay.

127
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:28,573
You should have a bite.
I‘m good. No, I‘m--

128
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,366
Really, Sherry, I‘m fine.
Take a little bite.

129
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:33,139
It‘s so good.
I can‘t. I can‘t! I can‘t.

130
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:37,341
I‘m sorry.
I just can‘t have any pie.

131
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:42,015
What do you mean,
you can‘t?

132
00:08:42,016 --> 00:08:44,083
Uh...

133
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:45,855
Okay, um...

134
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,728
I have a genetic disorder.

135
00:08:51,762 --> 00:08:52,862
Oh.

136
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:55,535
Okay.

137
00:08:57,933 --> 00:08:59,637
Go on.
Oh.

138
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:01,265
Yeah, um...

139
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:03,740
It‘s called CIPA.

140
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:07,942
Congenital Insensitivity
to Pain with Anhidrosis.

141
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:09,438
Um...

142
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:11,440
It affects my nervous system.

143
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:13,244
And it, uh...

144
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:16,445
basically makes it
so I can‘t feel pain.

145
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:17,622
Um...

146
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,316
Or hot or cold.

147
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:21,890
And that‘s why
I can‘t have the pie.

148
00:09:21,891 --> 00:09:24,729
Or any solid food,
really, because...

149
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:28,161
unknowingly I could...

150
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:30,701
bite my tongue off.

151
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:33,264
Oh, the coffee earlier.

152
00:09:33,265 --> 00:09:36,641
Yeah, I couldn‘t feel
that at all.

153
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,743
Holy shit!
Yeah.

154
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:40,502
You‘re a superhero.

155
00:09:40,503 --> 00:09:43,274
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

156
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:46,508
I have the power
to step on a nail,

157
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:49,380
and not know until my shoe
fills up with, uh...

158
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:51,051
blood.

159
00:09:51,052 --> 00:09:54,219
Right. Didn‘t think about that.

160
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,727
True story, by the way.
We were at the aquarium,
my mom fainted.

161
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:57,992
Jesus.
Yeah.

162
00:09:57,993 --> 00:10:00,159
My parents, they, um...

163
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,294
They basically spent my entire
childhood at the hospital.

164
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:04,669
And then when they found out

165
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,165
that the average
life expectancy

166
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:10,004
for my condition was, um, 25,

167
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:12,744
they sort of locked me up.

168
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:16,538
I‘m sorry.

169
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:19,442
No, hey, I‘m, you know, I‘m...

170
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:21,819
I‘m still kicking.

171
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,822
Okay. I mean,
I hear all that...

172
00:10:25,922 --> 00:10:27,725
but does that really mean
that you can‘t have

173
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:29,925
just a little bite of this pie?

174
00:10:29,926 --> 00:10:32,026
No. Can‘t. I mean...

175
00:10:32,027 --> 00:10:34,523
Like I said,
I could bite my tongue off.

176
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:36,558
You‘re not gonna bite
your tongue off, Nate.

177
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,396
This is the best cherry pie
on the west coast, okay?

178
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:40,673
I swear to God.

179
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,746
Listen. If anything
goes wrong, I‘m right here.

180
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,919
Okay.

181
00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:57,514
Okay?

182
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,385
Here we go.
Taking a bite.
Yep.

183
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:02,992
Open your mouth.

184
00:11:03,388 --> 00:11:04,586
Okay.

185
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:07,865
Remember, chew softly. Yep.

186
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:11,429
Uh-huh.
Let the magic happen.

187
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:16,841
Uh-huh.

188
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:24,112
My God, that is so good!

189
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:27,852
That is so good. Oh, my God!

190
00:11:29,117 --> 00:11:30,986
Oh, my God! Wha--
Yeah, I told you.

191
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:32,647
What?

192
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:35,155
This is pie? This is pie.
Yeah!

193
00:11:35,156 --> 00:11:36,860
Pie‘s good.

194
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:38,257
Congratulations.

195
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:39,358
Whoa!

196
00:11:42,262 --> 00:11:44,461
What are you doing
later tonight?

197
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,972
Look, she invited me out
to this art show.

198
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:52,205
I‘m just not gonna go.

199
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:55,340
I think I‘m just gonna
stay here and we‘ll play,
and it‘ll be fine.

200
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:57,408
<i>You‘ve been talking
about this girl for months.</i>

201
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:58,981
<i>You‘re basically
in love with her.</i>

202
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:00,983
<i>If I were you,
I‘d be all over that shit!</i>

203
00:12:00,984 --> 00:12:02,512
But I‘m not like you.

204
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,613
I‘m not cool.
I don‘t drive a Harley.

205
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:06,681
I‘m not this hunky guy
with a man bun.

206
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:08,584
<i>Again, it‘s a short pony.</i>

207
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:10,795
<i>But dude, that stuff is not
why I do well with women.</i>

208
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,028
<i>Does it help? Of course
it does, I‘m not gonna lie.</i>

209
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,965
<i>But confidence is king!</i>

210
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:18,132
I feel like I‘m gonna
mess it up somehow.

211
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:20,167
<i>What‘s the worst
that can happen?</i>

212
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:22,532
<i>You wind up alone
in your living room
playing video games?</i>

213
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:27,175
<i>You‘re already there, my guy!
What do you have to lose?</i>

214
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,950
<i>Nate, you‘re gonna die.</i>
What?

215
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:35,754
Oh, shit. Sorry. Um...

216
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,646
Ah, okay.

217
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:40,715
<i>No, no, no, that was
actually really impressive.</i>

218
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:42,288
I‘m sorry, my head‘s
not in this right now.

219
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:44,059
Can I call you back
a little later?

220
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,390
<i>Oh, sure, yeah.
I‘ll just go fuck myself.</i>

221
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:47,096
Okay, thanks.

222
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:31,733
Boo!
Hey! Hi.

223
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:34,175
Hey. You came, you‘re here.
Yeah!

224
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:37,112
No, of course. You know,
my schedule cleared up

225
00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:38,949
and, uh, yeah.
Cool. Well,
I‘m glad you‘re here.

226
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,248
Yeah, of course.
What do you think?

227
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:42,778
These are yours?
Mm-hmm.

228
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:46,155
These are awesome.
Oh, thank you.

229
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:48,486
Who are they?

230
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:50,554
Um, they‘re from
my therapy group.

231
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:52,996
Some cutters, some suicidal.

232
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:55,757
Everyone‘s kind of
recovering in their own way.

233
00:13:55,758 --> 00:13:58,397
Jesus, you run
a therapy group,
too? Huh.

234
00:13:58,398 --> 00:14:00,597
Oh.
No, no, no. I attend it.

235
00:14:00,598 --> 00:14:02,072
Oh. Oh.

236
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:05,371
Damn, I‘m so...
I‘m sorry.

237
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:08,374
No, no, no.
Don‘t apologize.
I did not mean...

238
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,639
You‘re okay, it‘s fine.
Okay.

239
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,014
I‘m not ashamed of it.
Okay.

240
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:13,610
Oh, wait, you have a...
Oh, God!

241
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,086
I sold one.
Yeah.

242
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,682
Why are you so surprised?

243
00:14:20,288 --> 00:14:21,520
Come on.

244
00:14:22,587 --> 00:14:23,786
Oh, yeah.

245
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:28,328
Um... So,
where‘d you grow up?

246
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:31,596
Well, I grew up in Tucson.

247
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:33,664
And Cedar City.

248
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:36,040
And Sacramento.

249
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,140
Hmm.

250
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:40,109
I was in foster care.
Okay, yeah.

251
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,112
So I just kind of
bounced around
until I was twelve

252
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:44,773
and then I got adopted.

253
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:46,951
And I had, you know, uh,

254
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,844
my own room
and a big brother
and parents.

255
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:51,648
And it was all
very exciting.

256
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:53,925
That‘s amazing!
Do you still see them a lot?

257
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:56,686
Not really, no.

258
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,259
Um...

259
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,757
It wasn‘t exactly
a loving household.

260
00:15:01,362 --> 00:15:02,461
Okay.
Yeah.

261
00:15:02,462 --> 00:15:04,035
Yeah.
So, I, uh...

262
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:06,597
left when I was eighteen,

263
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:07,940
and I‘ve been
on my own ever since.

264
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:12,208
Man, that is tough.
I‘m sorry.

265
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,044
It‘s fine.

266
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:15,507
You know,

267
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:17,872
if you don‘t have
anybody you care about,

268
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:19,314
it‘s harder to get hurt, right?

269
00:15:20,645 --> 00:15:22,086
Novocaine?

270
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,453
Holy shit.

271
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,256
It is you!

272
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:30,192
I mean...
This is fucking wild.

273
00:15:30,193 --> 00:15:31,655
I...

274
00:15:31,656 --> 00:15:33,933
I thought
you‘d be dead by now.

275
00:15:34,857 --> 00:15:36,067
Yeah, well...

276
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:38,332
I‘m not.
Yeah!

277
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,829
Good for you, bro.

278
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:44,272
Just like old times, huh?

279
00:15:44,273 --> 00:15:45,867
It‘s fucking Novocaine!

280
00:15:45,868 --> 00:15:47,671
And he‘s not fucking dead!

281
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,641
So who was that?

282
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:53,413
Oh. Uh, that was, um...

283
00:15:53,414 --> 00:15:55,713
some asshole that I went
to middle school with.

284
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,882
And what did
he call you?
Novocaine?

285
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,292
Yeah, uh, it was...

286
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:07,130
It was just
some dumb nickname
they gave me.

287
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:11,002
You know, once the other kids
found out about my condition,

288
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,566
they basically started kicking
my ass pretty much daily,

289
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,403
figuring it didn‘t matter,
you know,

290
00:16:16,404 --> 00:16:19,143
because I couldn‘t
feel any of it, so...

291
00:16:22,707 --> 00:16:23,807
I‘m sorry.

292
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:26,986
Yeah.
But...

293
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:30,912
I got to say, as far
as nicknames go...

294
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:33,123
"Novocaine"?

295
00:16:33,124 --> 00:16:36,523
Kind of badass.
No.

296
00:16:37,227 --> 00:16:38,788
Really?
Yeah! Yeah.

297
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,660
Okay, well, thank you,
but they didn‘t think so.

298
00:16:42,496 --> 00:16:44,102
It-it... It was fine.

299
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:49,470
S-Sorry. Um, excuse me for
one second. I‘m just gonna...

300
00:16:51,406 --> 00:16:52,506
Hey!

301
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:54,046
Yeah?

302
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,773
What is the deal
with the alarm?

303
00:16:56,774 --> 00:16:58,116
Yeah, um...

304
00:16:59,447 --> 00:17:01,151
I got to set one of these
every three hours

305
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:03,220
or else my bladder
might explode.

306
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:08,753
Other kids had a blast
with that one, too. Trust me.

307
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:37,583
You‘re so funny.
Yeah,
I like to think I am.

308
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:39,156
World-traveling
kinda guy.
Hey.

309
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:41,686
Glad you two
are getting along.

310
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:43,854
We really are.
He‘s hilarious.

311
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:46,790
You know what?

312
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,364
I think you two just need to
let bygones be bygones.

313
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:50,828
What do you say?

314
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,864
What do you mean?
Shots! Duh!

315
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,141
Come on. My treat.

316
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,803
Yeah, sure, why not?
Nice. Okay, great.

317
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:02,180
Hey, and, uh,
no hard feelings, right?

318
00:18:03,412 --> 00:18:04,908
Yeah, sure.

319
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,516
"Feelings." Get it?

320
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:12,091
That‘s so clever.
This fucking guy.

321
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:14,983
There you go.

322
00:18:14,984 --> 00:18:16,523
Thank you.

323
00:18:16,524 --> 00:18:18,020
Here you go.

324
00:18:28,503 --> 00:18:29,932
What the fuck was that?

325
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:33,067
Yeah, what is that?

326
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:36,511
Leapin‘ Larry‘s
Five Alarm
Ghost Pepper Sauce.

327
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:39,744
Do you like it?

328
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:43,452
Yeah,
it‘s Novocaine‘s favorite.

329
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,261
Hey, should we, um,
head back to your place?

330
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:53,087
You can put those on his tab.

331
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:54,924
No!
Done.

332
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:59,599
That was amazing.
That was...

333
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,437
You‘re a
very good actor.
Oh, thank you.

334
00:19:02,438 --> 00:19:04,274
Oh, my God.
That‘s got to be
killing him

335
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:06,574
thinking that
I‘m taking you home.

336
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:09,313
But you are.

337
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,579
Wait, what?

338
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:20,918
Have you really
read all these books?

339
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:24,459
I don‘t get out much.

340
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,231
Really?
You‘ve even read the...

341
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,091
<i>Mayo Clinic A-to-Z</i>
?

342
00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:33,435
When you can, um, impale
yourself without realizing it,

343
00:19:33,436 --> 00:19:34,799
uh, you know,

344
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,099
first aid knowledge
comes in pretty handy.

345
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:38,705
Touché.

346
00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:43,908
You‘re a real Renaissance man,
Nathan Caine.

347
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,615
I never would‘ve guessed.

348
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,691
Hi.
Hello.

349
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,233
What else are you hiding?

350
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:05,126
Sorry.
No.

351
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:06,436
No, I‘m sorry. Uh...

352
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:08,702
It‘s okay.

353
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:10,869
You sure?
Yeah.

354
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:24,388
Is there more?

355
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:28,887
There‘s a bit more, yeah.

356
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:39,832
Whoa.

357
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:44,132
Nate, what the...

358
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:46,871
What the fuck? Who are you?

359
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:49,379
These are amazing.
Where did you get them done?

360
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,579
Uh...

361
00:20:51,712 --> 00:20:54,318
I did them myself.
No, did you really?

362
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,012
Yeah.
How long did that take you?

363
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:57,420
Um...

364
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:59,818
Well, it started
when I was a teenager and...

365
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:01,490
as I got better at it,

366
00:21:01,491 --> 00:21:04,395
I kind of got more sucked
into it, and it was, uh...

367
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,596
It was just like, um,

368
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,060
this secret world.

369
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,194
This...

370
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,504
This other life that,

371
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:18,068
you know,
was actually an adventure.

372
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:20,741
It‘s a story, isn‘t it?

373
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,238
Yeah. Yeah, you could...

374
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,175
You could
call it that, yeah.

375
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:29,816
How does it end?

376
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,753
I don‘t know. Um...

377
00:21:33,787 --> 00:21:35,393
I‘m still figuring that out.

378
00:21:38,594 --> 00:21:39,958
So, I have a question.

379
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:45,567
If you can‘t feel pain,

380
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:51,409
does that also mean
that you can‘t feel...

381
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,070
pleasure?

382
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,079
I mean, uh...

383
00:22:03,047 --> 00:22:04,356
I think I can.

384
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,151
Can you feel this?

385
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:14,828
I feel a little bit
of pressure.

386
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,600
Okay.

387
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:20,262
How about this?

388
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:29,843
Definitely feeling something.

389
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:51,865
You‘re...

390
00:22:52,602 --> 00:22:53,900
gorgeous.

391
00:22:57,101 --> 00:22:59,070
It‘s not just you, Nate.

392
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:02,711
Everybody is hiding something.

393
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:06,209
I think we‘re all just...

394
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,818
looking for someone
we can show it to.

395
00:24:10,141 --> 00:24:11,549
Yes!

396
00:24:22,351 --> 00:24:23,627
Sorry!

397
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:49,619
"Hey, Sherry, so last night
was life-changing."

398
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,985
No, no, no. Way too big. Uh...

399
00:24:52,887 --> 00:24:54,448
"Last night was really great."

400
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:55,593
Uh...

401
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,221
"Last night was...

402
00:24:58,222 --> 00:24:59,663
amazing."

403
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:06,032
Ho, ho, ho!

404
00:25:06,604 --> 00:25:07,736
Ah, gentlemen.

405
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:09,463
Love the outfits.

406
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:11,234
How can I help you?

407
00:25:11,235 --> 00:25:12,643
We‘re here
to make a withdrawal.

408
00:25:15,074 --> 00:25:16,404
Get down on the fucking ground!

409
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:18,439
Get down! Get down!

410
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,815
Get on the fucking ground!

411
00:25:20,816 --> 00:25:22,817
Take the back!
Get on the ground!

412
00:25:22,818 --> 00:25:25,314
Get down!
All right, everyone.

413
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,591
Do exactly as we say

414
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,659
and you‘ll all live
to open up your presents.

415
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,992
Phones on the ground
in front of you!

416
00:25:32,993 --> 00:25:34,665
Hands behind your heads!

417
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,635
Mr. Manager...

418
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:39,736
...you‘re up.

419
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:47,237
Alarm‘s tripped!

420
00:25:47,238 --> 00:25:48,503
Three minutes!

421
00:25:52,144 --> 00:25:53,507
Open the vault.

422
00:25:53,508 --> 00:25:55,014
I won‘t be able to
open it in time.

423
00:25:55,015 --> 00:25:56,555
2:45.

424
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,624
Open the vault
or I will kill you.

425
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,058
No. I won‘t do it.

426
00:26:08,127 --> 00:26:09,424
He won‘t do it.

427
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:11,262
Man called my bluff.

428
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:17,433
I...

429
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:19,204
asked you...

430
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,139
very nicely!

431
00:26:25,474 --> 00:26:27,442
Captain Kringle?
Huh?

432
00:26:27,443 --> 00:26:28,653
Your beard.

433
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:38,827
Sorry, buddy.

434
00:26:38,828 --> 00:26:40,093
You saw my face.

435
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,231
Assistant manager!

436
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,872
Your turn!

437
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,779
Two minutes.

438
00:27:00,883 --> 00:27:02,247
Combination!

439
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:06,085
Say the fucking combination!

440
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,385
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

441
00:27:09,386 --> 00:27:11,024
1:30.

442
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:12,795
Hey. Hey.
Hmm.

443
00:27:12,796 --> 00:27:14,127
Look at me.

444
00:27:15,524 --> 00:27:17,833
Say the fucking numbers.

445
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:18,934
Wha-- What?

446
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:28,812
No, no, no!

447
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:31,814
Don‘t.

448
00:27:31,815 --> 00:27:33,145
Huh.

449
00:27:33,146 --> 00:27:35,577
Okay. Have it your way.

450
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:37,314
Wait, hey, hey.

451
00:27:37,315 --> 00:27:39,514
Wait! Wait! Wait! No!

452
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:41,219
Don‘t! Stop, stop, stop!

453
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,056
Okay, here‘s the deal.

454
00:27:43,057 --> 00:27:45,124
Open the vault
or I open her brain pan.

455
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,521
Okay, okay.

456
00:27:46,522 --> 00:27:48,094
Three, two, one.
Okay! I‘m telling you!

457
00:27:48,095 --> 00:27:50,768
I‘m telling you!
Stop it! I‘m telling you!

458
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:55,498
01-32-26.

459
00:28:01,075 --> 00:28:02,637
Was that so hard?

460
00:28:10,788 --> 00:28:12,514
Come on, come on, come on.

461
00:28:15,617 --> 00:28:17,486
Holy shit.

462
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,654
Merry Christmas, motherfucker.

463
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:25,593
Come to me, baby.

464
00:28:26,936 --> 00:28:28,464
Cops are here early!

465
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:29,971
Go. Let‘s move it!

466
00:28:29,972 --> 00:28:31,500
Take the bag!
He‘s got the other.

467
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,271
Let‘s move!

468
00:28:33,272 --> 00:28:35,009
Grab a fucking hostage.

469
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,638
Sorry, sweetheart.

470
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:39,718
Come on.

471
00:28:41,445 --> 00:28:44,184
Here we go.
Don‘t fucking look at me!

472
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,451
Merry Christmas.

473
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,763
All right,
three, two, one.
Move!

474
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,561
Guns on the ground!

475
00:28:59,562 --> 00:29:02,400
Okay! Okay.

476
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,468
Just take it easy.

477
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:10,638
Nobody needs to get hurt.

478
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:11,750
Go.

479
00:30:00,095 --> 00:30:02,163
Hurry up, asshole!
Let‘s go!

480
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:13,471
Sherry.

481
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,532
Help me.

482
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:47,273
Damn it.

483
00:30:47,274 --> 00:30:49,672
All right.

484
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,951
Hey, hey.

485
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,743
You‘re gonna be okay.

486
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,810
All right?

487
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:58,779
Just keep pressure on it.

488
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,190
<i>32 and 34,
backup eight minutes out.</i>

489
00:31:02,817 --> 00:31:04,291
Eight minutes?

490
00:31:12,464 --> 00:31:13,564
Don‘t.

491
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,908
I‘m sorry. I‘m sorry.

492
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,834
I will bring it back.
Come on!

493
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,705
Oh, my God, what am I doing?

494
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:49,105
Hey, you good?

495
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,733
Good?

496
00:31:51,734 --> 00:31:53,735
I‘m better than good.
We‘re rich, motherfuckers!

497
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:55,143
It‘s not about the money.

498
00:31:55,144 --> 00:31:57,377
What is important
is that we had fun.

499
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,954
Aw, fuck, I‘m going fast.

500
00:32:07,222 --> 00:32:08,321
Guys?

501
00:32:08,322 --> 00:32:09,883
<i>We‘ve got company.</i>

502
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:11,886
<i>These fucking cops!</i>

503
00:32:15,197 --> 00:32:16,593
Oh, fuck!

504
00:32:22,435 --> 00:32:24,040
Okay. Okay. You‘re okay.

505
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,141
You‘re okay, you‘re okay.

506
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,016
Fuck, he‘s still coming!

507
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,644
What‘s your fucking call, genius?

508
00:32:34,645 --> 00:32:36,547
Split up.
Meet back at the shop.

509
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:38,186
Get on the highway.
No, no, no.

510
00:32:38,187 --> 00:32:39,847
Ain‘t getting on the highway.
Get on the highway.

511
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:41,024
I want to stay there.
He needs us.

512
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:43,423
Do it!
He‘s--

513
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,163
Come on. Which one, Sherry?

514
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:54,665
Please be the one.
Please be the one.

515
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:01,012
Shit! Jesus!

516
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,476
Oh, shit!

517
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,350
What the fuck?

518
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:13,485
Hey, are you okay?

519
00:33:13,486 --> 00:33:14,618
Sorry. No, I‘m sorry.

520
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:16,027
Where you going?

521
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:18,996
Out of the way!

522
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,295
Fuck off!

523
00:33:26,763 --> 00:33:29,600
Oh, hey, hey. Hey, look.

524
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:32,043
Look, I don‘t want any trouble.
I just want to know
where Sherry is.

525
00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:33,638
Wait.

526
00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:36,112
You‘re not a cop?

527
00:33:36,113 --> 00:33:37,773
Uh, no, but...

528
00:33:37,774 --> 00:33:39,940
Come on, man.
Just tell me where she is.

529
00:33:39,941 --> 00:33:42,449
I‘ll let you go. Okay?

530
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:47,916
You ever fired
a gun before?

531
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:55,428
Do you, uh...
even know where
the safety is? Hmm?

532
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:56,727
Mm-hmm.

533
00:34:03,437 --> 00:34:04,636
Hey, wait!

534
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,006
Hey, man.

535
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:14,645
I don‘t want to fight, okay?
I‘m not that guy. I just want--

536
00:34:23,787 --> 00:34:25,756
Get the fuck out of my way.
Move!

537
00:34:29,628 --> 00:34:31,662
You‘re fucking dead,
you know that?

538
00:34:43,312 --> 00:34:45,215
Just tell me. Please.

539
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:48,779
Motherfuck--

540
00:34:50,011 --> 00:34:51,814
Okay, so those are
definitely third degree,

541
00:34:51,815 --> 00:34:53,717
so you‘re gonna want
to run it under some cool--

542
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,654
I‘m not done with you.

543
00:34:56,655 --> 00:34:58,887
Okay, wait, hold on.
Come here.

544
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,659
Look, I still feel like we can
both get what we want here.

545
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,629
Oh, you‘re strong!

546
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:11,273
Ooh, I am so sorry.

547
00:35:22,483 --> 00:35:24,484
Hey, last chance.

548
00:35:24,485 --> 00:35:27,081
Tell me where she is.
Eat shit.

549
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:36,530
Okay, okay. Uh...

550
00:35:41,733 --> 00:35:42,833
Come here!

551
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,562
You don‘t have, like,
a gluten thing, do you?

552
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:40,055
Hey.

553
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:42,431
Hey, man, you okay?

554
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,172
Oh, shit. Okay, okay.

555
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:00,844
You had to do it.
You had to do it.

556
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:02,220
Think about Sherry.

557
00:37:22,097 --> 00:37:23,274
"At work."

558
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:26,067
At work.

559
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:27,706
Um...

560
00:37:27,707 --> 00:37:28,906
Hey, what?

561
00:37:35,352 --> 00:37:37,079
Okay, okay.

562
00:37:40,786 --> 00:37:41,852
All right.

563
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:17,250
<i>I‘m sorry,
so Sherry was kidnapped</i>

564
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:18,856
<i>and you killed a guy
in a kitchen?</i>

565
00:38:18,857 --> 00:38:20,429
Roscoe, just listen to me
very carefully.

566
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,728
I don‘t have a lot of--
Oh, my God, I got shot.

567
00:38:22,729 --> 00:38:24,301
<i>What, you got shot?</i>
Just listen.

568
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,567
I just texted you a photo
of a tattoo.

569
00:38:26,568 --> 00:38:28,866
I need you to call around
to every parlor in San Diego

570
00:38:28,867 --> 00:38:30,340
and try to find out
who did the art.

571
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,704
<i>What am I,
your fucking secretary?</i>

572
00:38:31,705 --> 00:38:33,310
<i>I‘m not doing shit!</i>

573
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,268
Roscoe, I wouldn‘t ask
if I had any other choice.

574
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:36,445
I mean, we‘re a team, right?

575
00:38:36,446 --> 00:38:37,809
<i>Yes, a video game team.</i>

576
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,448
<i>We‘ve never even met in person.</i>

577
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:42,385
<i>And now you‘re involving me
in a real-life murder?</i>

578
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:43,749
<i>Why don‘t you
just call the police?</i>

579
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,213
You know,
I technically stole a cop car.

580
00:38:46,214 --> 00:38:48,424
Then there‘s the whole thing
about the guy that I killed.

581
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:50,459
<i>Fine. Jesus.
I‘ll get you the address,</i>

582
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,592
<i>but that‘s it, okay?</i>

583
00:38:51,593 --> 00:38:52,791
Okay, thank you!

584
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:53,892
Thank you, bye.

585
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,167
Details are still trickling in,

586
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:09,137
but we have confirmed reports
of multiple fatalities.

587
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,545
Citizens are advised to report

588
00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:12,811
any suspicious activity
in their area

589
00:39:12,812 --> 00:39:15,077
but to not engage
with possible suspects.

590
00:39:15,078 --> 00:39:16,981
Shit.
Bad week to quit drinking.

591
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:20,313
You quit drinking?

592
00:39:20,314 --> 00:39:22,623
No, no.
I just mean it would be.

593
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,559
Detective!
Yeah, what do you got?

594
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,725
There‘s three officers down.

595
00:39:25,726 --> 00:39:27,287
One in the ICU.

596
00:39:27,288 --> 00:39:29,828
Bank manager DOA inside.

597
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:31,764
Three gunmen, two cars.

598
00:39:31,765 --> 00:39:33,502
They took a hostage with them.

599
00:39:33,503 --> 00:39:35,471
And one additional suspect
at large.

600
00:39:35,472 --> 00:39:36,637
Additional suspect?

601
00:39:36,638 --> 00:39:38,738
Yeah, the assistant manager.

602
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:41,004
He stole a cruiser
and followed the gunmen.

603
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:43,337
Witnesses say it‘s
the same guy
who opened the vault.

604
00:39:44,943 --> 00:39:46,417
Could be a double-cross.

605
00:39:47,517 --> 00:39:48,847
Do we have units in pursuit?

606
00:39:48,848 --> 00:39:50,816
No, these were
the only ones in the area.

607
00:39:50,817 --> 00:39:52,488
Calls went out
to the Fifth and Sixth,

608
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:54,853
but they‘re spread thin
‘cause of the holidays.

609
00:39:54,854 --> 00:39:57,021
Okay, thank you, Officer.
Thank you.

610
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:03,158
We need to get a file on
that assistant manager, quick.

611
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,732
Today was supposed to be
an easy one.

612
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:08,834
I‘m going.
Thanks.

613
00:40:08,835 --> 00:40:09,902
I‘m going.

614
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:12,772
Coming through, newsies!
Out of my way!

615
00:40:12,773 --> 00:40:13,873
Come on.

616
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:52,207
Closed for lunch!
Come back later!

617
00:40:54,144 --> 00:40:55,244
Hmm.

618
00:40:57,686 --> 00:41:00,050
Hey! It‘s me! Nate!

619
00:41:00,051 --> 00:41:01,722
What in the Sam Hill?

620
00:41:01,723 --> 00:41:03,791
From the bank.
Could you let me in?

621
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:06,464
Hi.

622
00:41:11,931 --> 00:41:14,262
You sure you don‘t want me
to just call you an ambulance?

623
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,935
Uh, no. I told you.
There‘s no time.

624
00:41:17,134 --> 00:41:18,233
All right.

625
00:41:19,774 --> 00:41:21,038
Sweet Jesus!

626
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,370
Here we go.

627
00:41:27,408 --> 00:41:31,015
Earl, you okay?
Me? Oh, yeah, just--

628
00:41:31,016 --> 00:41:33,754
This was not
what I expected today.

629
00:41:33,755 --> 00:41:35,757
Hey, if it‘s
any consolation,
me neither.

630
00:41:37,055 --> 00:41:38,155
All right.

631
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,992
All right.

632
00:41:40,894 --> 00:41:42,126
If I can find it.

633
00:41:44,832 --> 00:41:47,098
Huh. Is that it?

634
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,608
Hey! There we go.
Ah!

635
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,875
All right.

636
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:58,879
Just some of this.

637
00:41:59,649 --> 00:42:00,980
Just a little bit.

638
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:04,115
Okay.

639
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:05,885
Here we go.

640
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:09,626
Yeah. There we go, see?

641
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,595
Good as new.

642
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:15,323
Oh, whoa. Um...

643
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,995
Earl, was there--

644
00:42:16,996 --> 00:42:18,766
There‘s an EpiPen
in there, right?

645
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:20,197
You mind
handing that to me?

646
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,968
What?
You allergic to something?

647
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:24,574
Um, thank you, no, uh...

648
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,609
epinephrine‘s just
another form
of adrenaline.

649
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,844
It should, uh, keep me
from passing out.

650
00:42:36,015 --> 00:42:37,181
Yeah, that did it.

651
00:42:37,852 --> 00:42:39,117
Okay.

652
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:44,187
Yeah, all right. Hey, Earl.

653
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:45,893
Thank you so much.
Sorry, this was...

654
00:42:46,454 --> 00:42:47,520
a lot.

655
00:42:47,521 --> 00:42:49,567
You go get that girl, Nate.

656
00:42:52,867 --> 00:42:54,396
Oh, hey, um...

657
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:59,203
Almost forgot.
This should help with
the mortgage for a while.

658
00:43:01,975 --> 00:43:04,043
Betty always said
you were a good kid.

659
00:43:08,883 --> 00:43:10,049
Oh! Sorry.

660
00:43:11,248 --> 00:43:13,821
All right, uh,
I‘ll see you later.

661
00:43:13,822 --> 00:43:15,450
You know, if I--
If I don‘t, uh, die.

662
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:27,638
You might want to
launder that,
by the way.

663
00:43:28,463 --> 00:43:29,563
Ah.

664
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,173
One of our bank robbers?

665
00:44:09,174 --> 00:44:11,076
God, I hope so.

666
00:44:11,077 --> 00:44:13,573
Be a shame
if it was
the real Santa.

667
00:44:13,574 --> 00:44:18,150
Kitchen staff said a crazy guy
in a tie did all this.

668
00:44:19,118 --> 00:44:21,285
I‘m thinking that‘s
our assistant manager.

669
00:44:22,022 --> 00:44:23,385
Oh, speaking of...

670
00:44:25,795 --> 00:44:27,555
Got a bit of a profile on him.

671
00:44:30,426 --> 00:44:32,064
Uh, Nathan Caine.

672
00:44:32,065 --> 00:44:34,099
Single. Male. Thirty.

673
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,200
No record. No affiliations.

674
00:44:36,201 --> 00:44:38,301
Zero traffic tickets.

675
00:44:38,302 --> 00:44:42,042
An online gamer tag
of "Magicnateball."

676
00:44:42,603 --> 00:44:44,714
Oh, that‘s good. Uh...

677
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:48,080
Worked at San Diego Trust
for six years.

678
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:50,754
That just doesn‘t sound
like a stone-cold killer to me.

679
00:44:51,414 --> 00:44:52,855
And yet...

680
00:44:54,648 --> 00:44:55,759
Yeah.

681
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,827
Do you have
a cell phone number
for him?

682
00:44:58,828 --> 00:45:01,698
Guy just robbed a bank,
killed a guy.

683
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,766
Do you really think he‘s just
picking up his cell phone?

684
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,166
This is Nate speaking.
<i>Hi, Nate.</i>

685
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:10,300
Uh, this is
Detective Barbara Mincy

686
00:45:10,301 --> 00:45:12,269
of the San Diego Police.

687
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,600
How you doing?

688
00:45:13,601 --> 00:45:14,975
<i>I‘ve-- I‘ve been better.</i>

689
00:45:14,976 --> 00:45:16,471
Did you catch the others?

690
00:45:16,472 --> 00:45:18,671
Is Sherry, the hostage,
is she safe?

691
00:45:18,672 --> 00:45:20,816
Yeah, well, you know,
we‘re working on that.

692
00:45:20,817 --> 00:45:23,115
But whatever it is you‘re doing
isn‘t making our job easier.

693
00:45:23,116 --> 00:45:25,755
So if you could turn yourself
and the cash in right now--

694
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,384
Whoa, wait, wait, sorry. Um...

695
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:31,860
Holy shit.
You think I‘m in on this.

696
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:34,192
<i>No, no, Nate, uh,
we‘re just following
the facts here.</i>

697
00:45:34,193 --> 00:45:37,426
Look, hey, I don‘t
give a shit about the money.
I just want to save Sherry.

698
00:45:37,427 --> 00:45:40,836
Mm-hmm. Well, that‘s our job
to worry about, not yours.

699
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:43,333
Yeah, well, I heard that
75% of hostages who die

700
00:45:43,334 --> 00:45:45,401
are killed in the first
three hours, so...

701
00:45:45,402 --> 00:45:47,172
<i>Unless you‘re calling me
to tell me you found her,</i>

702
00:45:47,173 --> 00:45:48,504
<i>I‘m not gonna stop.</i>

703
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:50,341
This Sherry...

704
00:45:51,309 --> 00:45:53,475
She, uh, she your girlfriend?

705
00:45:53,476 --> 00:45:55,675
<i>Yeah, I mean, you know,
we haven‘t necessarily</i>

706
00:45:55,676 --> 00:45:57,710
<i>put a label on anything yet,
but the--</i>

707
00:45:57,711 --> 00:45:59,547
Stop it, all right? I know
what you‘re trying to do.

708
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,922
You don‘t give a shit about us.

709
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:02,385
No, Nate, that‘s not true.

710
00:46:02,386 --> 00:46:05,025
We just want everyone
to get home safe, okay?

711
00:46:05,026 --> 00:46:06,290
I understand you care
about her, but--

712
00:46:06,291 --> 00:46:07,391
<i>Do you?</i>

713
00:46:09,657 --> 00:46:12,594
Do you know what it‘s like
to wait your whole life
to meet someone?

714
00:46:14,068 --> 00:46:15,938
Someone who changes everything?
Who...

715
00:46:17,368 --> 00:46:19,304
finally gives your life
meaning?

716
00:46:21,504 --> 00:46:23,913
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

717
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,740
My daughter.

718
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,514
And if your daughter
was kidnapped,

719
00:46:32,515 --> 00:46:34,715
<i>would you wait around
for someone else to save her?</i>

720
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:37,289
Or would you do it yourself?

721
00:46:45,198 --> 00:46:47,497
All right, Nate.
Have it your way.

722
00:46:57,771 --> 00:46:59,344
Got a trace on his cell.

723
00:47:04,085 --> 00:47:05,317
Hey, you good?

724
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,286
Yeah. Let‘s move.

725
00:47:10,586 --> 00:47:16,129
<i>11898, I show your dispatch
and send 29C-47.</i>

726
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:19,132
This is a total fucking
shit show, man.

727
00:47:19,133 --> 00:47:22,135
Look, there‘s nothing
on the scanner
about your brother.

728
00:47:22,136 --> 00:47:24,104
That means he probably
lost the tail.

729
00:47:24,105 --> 00:47:25,876
Then why the fuck
ain‘t he here?

730
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,438
I don‘t know!

731
00:47:28,439 --> 00:47:30,375
Okay? I don‘t know.
I‘m sorry.
I don‘t know everything.

732
00:47:32,146 --> 00:47:35,247
Maybe he had to
switch vehicles.

733
00:47:35,248 --> 00:47:37,920
Maybe he stopped off
to get some ice cream.

734
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:40,549
The point is, your fucking
whining about it

735
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:42,860
isn‘t gonna make him
show up any faster.

736
00:47:45,456 --> 00:47:47,325
Watch how
you‘re talking to me.

737
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:48,557
You may be running point
on this,

738
00:47:48,558 --> 00:47:50,164
but you‘re not
my fucking boss.

739
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,133
Hmm.

740
00:47:52,826 --> 00:47:54,266
Andre...

741
00:47:54,267 --> 00:47:56,907
I need you to switch up
the vibe right now.

742
00:47:59,635 --> 00:48:01,978
Because you‘re bumming me out.

743
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,441
Come on.

744
00:48:04,442 --> 00:48:06,179
Ben is gonna be back
in 15 minutes

745
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,445
and everything
is gonna be fine.

746
00:48:08,446 --> 00:48:11,844
Just keep saying it.
"Everything is gonna be fine."

747
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:13,220
Yeah, fucking right.

748
00:48:22,163 --> 00:48:24,363
No more silent treatment, huh?

749
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:31,172
Hey.

750
00:48:32,536 --> 00:48:34,208
I‘m sorry I hit you, okay?

751
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:38,476
Do you, um...

752
00:48:40,346 --> 00:48:41,544
Do you want to hit me?

753
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:43,349
Make it even?

754
00:48:44,218 --> 00:48:45,549
Fuck you.

755
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:47,485
Wow.

756
00:48:49,817 --> 00:48:51,390
I do not like that tone.

757
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:53,997
I don‘t like it.

758
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:58,936
But I got just the thing
to fix that attitude.

759
00:49:12,906 --> 00:49:14,984
Oh, come on!

760
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:17,020
You love cola gummies.
Stop it, Simon!

761
00:49:17,614 --> 00:49:18,713
Stop.

762
00:49:18,714 --> 00:49:20,055
What is this?

763
00:49:20,056 --> 00:49:22,553
Who is this little tantrum for?

764
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:27,557
We‘re alone now.

765
00:49:27,558 --> 00:49:30,428
You can feel free
to break character
whenever you‘d like, sis.

766
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:32,232
It‘s just that you promised
nobody would get hurt, okay?

767
00:49:32,233 --> 00:49:33,530
You fucking promised.

768
00:49:33,531 --> 00:49:34,927
It‘s the heat of battle,
Sher.

769
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:36,599
Shit happens.
The heat of battle?

770
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,798
You did not have
to kill Nigel!

771
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:40,702
Nigel? Who is Nigel?

772
00:49:40,703 --> 00:49:42,242
The bank manager.

773
00:49:42,243 --> 00:49:44,508
He was a nice fucking guy.

774
00:49:44,509 --> 00:49:46,246
He was a Nigel too,
wasn‘t he?

775
00:49:46,247 --> 00:49:48,117
Nigel.

776
00:49:51,384 --> 00:49:52,879
Sher.

777
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,057
I hate to break this to you,

778
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,950
but if you were able
to get that vault code
out of lover boy,

779
00:49:57,951 --> 00:50:00,029
everyone would be alive
right now, including Nigel.

780
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,955
Oh, my God.
Hmm.

781
00:50:02,956 --> 00:50:05,629
It‘s not like he had it
framed on his wall.

782
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,632
Sounds a whole lot
like an excuse.

783
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:13,604
You know how I feel
about excuses.

784
00:50:14,242 --> 00:50:15,342
Don‘t you?

785
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,709
You‘re so fucking impossible.

786
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:22,811
What‘s done is done.
Okay?

787
00:50:23,746 --> 00:50:25,880
Let‘s just stay focused
on the plan,

788
00:50:26,782 --> 00:50:28,222
and we can hash
all this out later

789
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,192
over some piña coladas
in Mexico.

790
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:32,854
Those are disgusting,
by the way.

791
00:50:34,295 --> 00:50:36,660
Ugh! Gets in your teeth.

792
00:50:55,712 --> 00:50:57,977
Yeah?
Hello, ma‘am.

793
00:50:57,978 --> 00:51:01,189
Um, is Zeno here?

794
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,982
I just need to talk
with him
for a second.

795
00:51:02,983 --> 00:51:04,654
Sorry, customers only.

796
00:51:04,655 --> 00:51:06,920
You know what?
That‘s actually
why I‘m here.

797
00:51:06,921 --> 00:51:10,694
Um, I‘m just looking
to get some work done.

798
00:51:14,929 --> 00:51:16,963
Looks like you‘ve already
had some work done today.

799
00:51:16,964 --> 00:51:18,173
Sorry?

800
00:51:18,174 --> 00:51:20,769
Oh! My appearance.

801
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:21,870
Uh, well,

802
00:51:23,036 --> 00:51:24,741
you should see
the other guy.

803
00:51:36,654 --> 00:51:37,754
Thank you.

804
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,856
Oh.

805
00:51:41,857 --> 00:51:43,892
Thought that was
a real guy
for a second.

806
00:51:49,997 --> 00:51:51,768
Wait here.
Thank you.

807
00:52:08,686 --> 00:52:10,226
You. What‘s good?

808
00:52:11,953 --> 00:52:13,261
I‘m good. I‘m--

809
00:52:13,262 --> 00:52:14,955
Everything‘s good. Um...

810
00:52:14,956 --> 00:52:17,760
Uh, I was just looking
to get a tattoo.

811
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:21,027
Fuck. What‘s happening
with your hand?

812
00:52:21,028 --> 00:52:22,139
Oh!

813
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,471
Psoriasis.

814
00:52:25,472 --> 00:52:27,440
It‘s really,
really flared up
on me today.

815
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:29,178
Yeah, all right.

816
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,872
So where we working?

817
00:52:30,873 --> 00:52:32,941
Uh, yeah, just, um...

818
00:52:34,382 --> 00:52:36,075
right here.

819
00:52:36,076 --> 00:52:38,616
Damn. I like your tats.
That‘s good shit.

820
00:52:38,617 --> 00:52:40,453
Oh. Wow, thank you so much.

821
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:43,116
I, uh, I like yours, too.

822
00:52:43,754 --> 00:52:46,052
So, uh, what you want?

823
00:52:46,053 --> 00:52:48,923
Well, I have
a buddy of mine, um,

824
00:52:48,924 --> 00:52:51,464
and he got this awesome tattoo.
I want the exact same one.

825
00:52:51,465 --> 00:52:54,500
I think he said
that he got it here?

826
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:56,062
No shit.

827
00:52:56,063 --> 00:52:58,274
You know Ben?
Ben!

828
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,804
Yeah.
Ben.

829
00:53:01,739 --> 00:53:04,609
So, um, did you guys
serve together?

830
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,105
Yeah, we did.

831
00:53:06,106 --> 00:53:07,942
Serve together.

832
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:09,978
Honorably.
Hmm.

833
00:53:10,616 --> 00:53:12,046
Rock on, brother.

834
00:53:14,785 --> 00:53:17,083
Hey, um, speaking of Ben,

835
00:53:17,084 --> 00:53:19,459
is he still working
at the same place?

836
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,956
I don‘t know.
Ben doesn‘t talk about work.

837
00:53:21,957 --> 00:53:23,860
Classic Ben. Hates work.

838
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:25,433
Hates it.

839
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:27,335
Um...

840
00:53:27,336 --> 00:53:29,568
Funny story about Ben.

841
00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:31,339
Um, you know
his last name, right?

842
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,506
Yeah.

843
00:53:32,968 --> 00:53:34,342
Okay.

844
00:53:34,343 --> 00:53:36,070
How would you
think it‘s pronounced?

845
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:46,420
Seriously, you‘re gonna...
you‘re gonna love this.

846
00:53:46,421 --> 00:53:48,555
Just... just say his last name.

847
00:53:53,329 --> 00:53:54,759
Why don‘t you say it?

848
00:53:59,962 --> 00:54:01,337
Ah, you know, never mind.

849
00:54:03,097 --> 00:54:05,373
It‘s fine.
It‘s not that funny.

850
00:54:05,374 --> 00:54:07,001
Because, you know,
if you tell a bad joke,

851
00:54:07,002 --> 00:54:08,838
you have to explain it,
it‘s not good.

852
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:10,312
Yeah, give me a sec.

853
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:12,282
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Take your time.

854
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:20,487
You know,

855
00:54:20,488 --> 00:54:22,753
I‘m thinking that
maybe you don‘t know Ben.

856
00:54:25,152 --> 00:54:26,856
Yo, what the fuck is this?

857
00:54:26,857 --> 00:54:28,760
I‘m not gonna hurt you, okay?
Just put down the knife.

858
00:54:32,896 --> 00:54:35,227
Tell me everything you know
about Ben and I‘m gone.

859
00:54:35,228 --> 00:54:36,438
Whoa!

860
00:54:38,198 --> 00:54:39,804
Shit!
Oh, no!

861
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,355
I‘ll give you another one
for free.

862
00:54:54,885 --> 00:54:57,492
Let me show you
how it‘s done.

863
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:10,933
Shit. Fuck.
Oh...

864
00:55:13,871 --> 00:55:16,170
Fuck! Ow! Shit.

865
00:55:16,709 --> 00:55:18,413
You little shit!

866
00:55:18,414 --> 00:55:19,976
Fuck you, man.

867
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,723
Enough of this shit.

868
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:05,318
What the fuck are you doing?

869
00:56:22,137 --> 00:56:23,335
Oh!

870
00:56:23,336 --> 00:56:25,140
Fuck!

871
00:56:36,987 --> 00:56:38,856
Shit! Fuck! My eyes!

872
00:56:38,857 --> 00:56:42,156
Oh, fuck!

873
00:56:42,157 --> 00:56:45,324
I can‘t see!
Okay. All right, man.

874
00:56:45,325 --> 00:56:47,700
What the fuck?
What‘s his name?

875
00:56:47,701 --> 00:56:49,967
Fuck you and the horse
you rode in on, man.

876
00:56:53,168 --> 00:56:54,641
Okay. Look, look.

877
00:56:54,642 --> 00:56:57,369
Please.
Please don‘t make me do this.

878
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:59,515
Fucking eat shit, man.

879
00:57:00,615 --> 00:57:03,375
Okay. Okay,
this is gonna suck.
Are you sure?

880
00:57:03,376 --> 00:57:04,882
Oh, fuck off!

881
00:57:04,883 --> 00:57:06,455
Okay. Here we go.

882
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:08,589
Fuck!

883
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:10,316
Hey, hey,
just give me his name.

884
00:57:10,317 --> 00:57:12,494
Just give me his name.

885
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:14,188
Oh, Jesus!

886
00:57:14,189 --> 00:57:16,432
Fuck, it‘s Clark!
It‘s Clark!
Okay. Okay.

887
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,633
Clark, Ben. Ben Clark.

888
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,361
There we go.
Was that so hard?

889
00:57:22,934 --> 00:57:24,737
Listen, I‘ve given you
what you want.

890
00:57:24,738 --> 00:57:26,398
Now just fucking go.

891
00:57:26,399 --> 00:57:27,806
Just one second.
One second.

892
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:30,710
Oh, shit.

893
00:57:30,711 --> 00:57:33,174
Hey there, Chad, it‘s Nate
over at San Diego Trust.

894
00:57:33,175 --> 00:57:35,715
Glad I caught you
before the holiday.

895
00:57:35,716 --> 00:57:38,553
Yeah, listen, I was hoping you
could run a quick credit check

896
00:57:38,554 --> 00:57:40,412
on a new client
whose file‘s incomplete.

897
00:57:40,413 --> 00:57:42,216
His name is Ben Clark.

898
00:57:42,217 --> 00:57:44,824
He did serve in the military.
Does that narrow it down?

899
00:57:46,419 --> 00:57:49,058
Yeah. Yeah, V.A. loans.
That‘s him.

900
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:52,392
Um, you don‘t have any
employment on record, do you?

901
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:54,999
How about
a last-known residence?

902
00:57:56,396 --> 00:57:59,674
Yeah, um, yeah,
hold on one second. Um...

903
00:58:03,436 --> 00:58:05,141
Okay, shoot.

904
00:58:06,373 --> 00:58:07,649
Okay.

905
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:11,015
402...

906
00:58:12,885 --> 00:58:16,085
North Tower Lane.

907
00:58:16,086 --> 00:58:19,451
All right.
Chad, thank you so much, man.

908
00:58:19,452 --> 00:58:20,629
You‘re the best.

909
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:22,630
Oh.

910
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:25,568
Yeah, Merry Christmas
to you, too. Go, Padres.

911
00:59:07,775 --> 00:59:10,436
<i>Something‘s wrong.
He should definitely be here.</i>

912
00:59:10,437 --> 00:59:12,944
Look, he‘s got plenty of time.
We can‘t leave till
it‘s dark anyway.

913
00:59:12,945 --> 00:59:14,847
I‘m gonna check his house.
The house he just spent

914
00:59:14,848 --> 00:59:17,410
all weekend booby-trapping
like he‘s
Wile E. fucking Coyote?

915
00:59:17,411 --> 00:59:19,786
That house?
You think he‘s gonna
go back there?

916
00:59:19,787 --> 00:59:20,853
Use your brain, man.

917
00:59:20,854 --> 00:59:22,151
He‘s my brother!

918
00:59:22,152 --> 00:59:23,559
I‘m well aware of that.

919
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,022
Take a half hour.
If he‘s not there,

920
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:26,563
I‘ll come back and we can go.

921
00:59:27,795 --> 00:59:28,895
Andre.

922
00:59:29,962 --> 00:59:31,292
Andre!

923
00:59:31,293 --> 00:59:33,262
Don‘t be a fucking idiot!

924
01:00:29,252 --> 01:00:30,451
All right.

925
01:00:37,326 --> 01:00:40,593
Okay, so you‘re a prepper.

926
01:00:41,264 --> 01:00:42,463
Ew.

927
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,775
Where the hell do you work?

928
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:55,850
What?

929
01:00:56,543 --> 01:00:57,984
What is that?

930
01:01:02,758 --> 01:01:03,990
What the fuck is that?

931
01:01:05,222 --> 01:01:06,553
Why?

932
01:01:09,028 --> 01:01:10,733
Okay, uh...

933
01:01:15,804 --> 01:01:16,904
All right.

934
01:01:23,339 --> 01:01:25,341
Whoa. Hmm.

935
01:01:32,612 --> 01:01:33,855
No.

936
01:01:48,265 --> 01:01:49,595
There you are.

937
01:01:51,807 --> 01:01:53,006
Oh.

938
01:01:53,809 --> 01:01:55,503
Come on! Really?

939
01:02:02,851 --> 01:02:04,985
Crossbow under the sink.

940
01:02:06,019 --> 01:02:07,218
Of course.

941
01:02:17,426 --> 01:02:19,130
All right, whatever-- Fuck it.

942
01:02:59,435 --> 01:03:01,943
Okay. Okay.

943
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,085
Yes. Yes!

944
01:03:14,516 --> 01:03:15,616
Yes.

945
01:03:17,926 --> 01:03:20,422
Okay. I found you.

946
01:03:20,423 --> 01:03:22,798
And now I‘m gonna
make you wish you never--

947
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,394
Oh, my God!

948
01:03:26,363 --> 01:03:27,463
What?

949
01:03:33,106 --> 01:03:34,668
What the fuck?

950
01:03:37,638 --> 01:03:38,771
Oh, fu--

951
01:03:45,547 --> 01:03:48,154
Oh, phew. Big phew.

952
01:03:49,254 --> 01:03:50,617
Okay. Um...

953
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:57,756
<i>This better be you calling
from a hospital or a jail.</i>

954
01:03:57,757 --> 01:04:00,264
No, not quite. I‘m at, uh,

955
01:04:00,265 --> 01:04:02,629
402 North Tower Lane
in Cortez Hill.

956
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,763
I‘m hanging upside-down
and I need you to come get me.

957
01:04:04,764 --> 01:04:06,908
<i>What the hell do you mean
you‘re hanging upside-down?</i>

958
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,702
I mean I‘m currently suspended
in some kind of snare trap,

959
01:04:09,703 --> 01:04:11,605
and if you don‘t come right now
and cut me down,

960
01:04:11,606 --> 01:04:13,805
then Sherry‘s gonna die.
I‘m probably gonna die.

961
01:04:13,806 --> 01:04:15,312
<i>Dude, you can‘t put
that shit on me.</i>

962
01:04:15,313 --> 01:04:16,610
<i>I‘m not getting
involved in this.</i>

963
01:04:16,611 --> 01:04:18,481
You already are, okay?

964
01:04:19,482 --> 01:04:21,583
Look, man, I‘m sorry. I just...

965
01:04:23,992 --> 01:04:26,928
I don‘t know who else to call.

966
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:30,591
Maybe to you
I‘m just some random guy
you met on the Internet,

967
01:04:30,592 --> 01:04:33,330
but to me,
all that time we spent together
it actually meant something.

968
01:04:33,331 --> 01:04:34,695
You‘re...

969
01:04:36,433 --> 01:04:39,138
You‘re my only friend,
Roscoe.

970
01:04:39,139 --> 01:04:40,404
And right now,

971
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,109
I need you.

972
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:45,210
<i>Oh, goddamn it!</i>

973
01:04:45,211 --> 01:04:46,981
<i>Okay, look,
it says fifteen minutes,</i>

974
01:04:46,982 --> 01:04:48,950
<i>but I‘ll take the Harley
and be there in ten, all right?</i>

975
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:51,513
Yes! Yes, thank you.
Thank you so much.

976
01:04:51,514 --> 01:04:53,152
<i>Yeah, yeah, just hang in there.</i>

977
01:04:53,153 --> 01:04:55,550
<i>Sorry, that wasn‘t a pun.
I meant it sincerely.</i>

978
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,453
No, no, it was funny.
It was funny.

979
01:04:57,454 --> 01:04:58,894
Just please hurry, okay?

980
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,028
<i>Yeah, okay. Bye.</i>

981
01:05:00,523 --> 01:05:02,228
Okay. Okay.

982
01:05:02,855 --> 01:05:03,966
Okay, ten minutes.

983
01:05:04,428 --> 01:05:05,528
Ten minutes.

984
01:05:06,331 --> 01:05:07,661
I can make it ten minutes.
Okay.

985
01:05:09,499 --> 01:05:10,565
Ben?

986
01:05:10,566 --> 01:05:12,535
Oh, no.

987
01:05:14,471 --> 01:05:15,912
You here, bro?

988
01:05:45,568 --> 01:05:46,943
Hi.

989
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,374
Who the hell are you?

990
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:52,442
Uh. I‘m-- I‘m just a thief.

991
01:05:52,443 --> 01:05:54,709
You know,
just came here to, uh...

992
01:05:56,843 --> 01:05:58,185
thieve.

993
01:05:59,351 --> 01:06:00,417
Where‘s my brother?

994
01:06:00,418 --> 01:06:02,683
I‘m sorry, your what?

995
01:06:02,684 --> 01:06:04,883
Uh, look, man, look,
I don‘t know anything

996
01:06:04,884 --> 01:06:06,687
about anybody‘s brother. I‘m--

997
01:06:06,688 --> 01:06:10,163
You know, I just randomly
picked this place and, uh,

998
01:06:10,164 --> 01:06:12,759
well, apparently,
I picked wrong.

999
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,365
You know, most people
have the doorbell

1000
01:06:14,366 --> 01:06:16,697
with the camera,
but an indoor snare trap?

1001
01:06:16,698 --> 01:06:18,799
Egg on my face.

1002
01:06:19,899 --> 01:06:21,471
You don‘t look
like a thief.

1003
01:06:21,472 --> 01:06:22,671
Yeah, well,

1004
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:25,872
the best of us rarely do.
Hmm.

1005
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:31,052
So you just picked this place
at random, huh?

1006
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:33,351
Yeah. Yeah, just my luck.
Yeah?

1007
01:06:33,352 --> 01:06:34,914
Then why the fuck

1008
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:39,160
do you have his address
on your fucking hand?

1009
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:44,132
That‘s such a good question.

1010
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,298
And...

1011
01:06:46,299 --> 01:06:47,861
...the answer‘s really
gonna blow your mind.

1012
01:06:49,467 --> 01:06:52,140
Yeah, you can go ahead
and take that if you need to.

1013
01:06:53,273 --> 01:06:54,373
Yeah?

1014
01:06:55,473 --> 01:06:56,969
Look, um...

1015
01:06:59,246 --> 01:07:00,313
Ben‘s dead.

1016
01:07:01,413 --> 01:07:03,349
<i>Just heard it
over the scanner.</i>

1017
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:09,156
Who did it? Cops?
<i>Uh, no.</i>

1018
01:07:09,157 --> 01:07:11,555
Apparently, it was just
some random Good Samaritan.

1019
01:07:12,655 --> 01:07:14,162
Skinny guy in a suit.

1020
01:07:15,889 --> 01:07:17,066
Look, um,

1021
01:07:17,957 --> 01:07:19,430
why don‘t you
just get back here

1022
01:07:19,431 --> 01:07:20,761
<i>and we‘ll
figure it all out?</i>

1023
01:07:22,929 --> 01:07:25,140
Did he seriously
just hang up on me?

1024
01:07:37,185 --> 01:07:38,977
Whoa, whoa, hey, hold on.

1025
01:07:38,978 --> 01:07:40,583
Hold on. Hey.
Let‘s just talk about this.

1026
01:07:40,584 --> 01:07:41,947
You killed my brother!

1027
01:07:41,948 --> 01:07:43,455
Look, man, I, uh...

1028
01:07:46,524 --> 01:07:48,822
I did kill him.

1029
01:07:48,823 --> 01:07:50,956
And, look, I know that means
you‘re gonna kill me, too,

1030
01:07:50,957 --> 01:07:53,531
but please just
do me a favor, okay? Just--

1031
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:55,631
Just make it quick.

1032
01:07:55,632 --> 01:07:58,404
There‘s no need
to draw this out.

1033
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,641
I got a better idea.

1034
01:08:07,006 --> 01:08:08,479
Yes!

1035
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,482
You know,
when I used to do this shit

1036
01:08:11,483 --> 01:08:13,814
back in special forces...

1037
01:08:13,815 --> 01:08:15,354
Mmm.

1038
01:08:15,355 --> 01:08:18,049
...it was always to try
and get some information.

1039
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,359
Mm-hmm.

1040
01:08:20,492 --> 01:08:22,428
But all that matters now...

1041
01:08:22,956 --> 01:08:24,100
is the pain.

1042
01:08:25,024 --> 01:08:27,399
Think about that.
You understand pain?

1043
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,368
Yeah...
I hate it so much.

1044
01:08:32,603 --> 01:08:35,572
Oh. Oh! No! Stop it!

1045
01:08:37,003 --> 01:08:39,378
I mean, oh, fuck!

1046
01:08:39,379 --> 01:08:41,908
This is bad!

1047
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:43,712
Goddamn it!

1048
01:08:48,784 --> 01:08:49,917
Oh, wow.

1049
01:08:52,051 --> 01:08:54,658
Oh, God,
you sadistic fuck.

1050
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,859
Oh.

1051
01:08:59,762 --> 01:09:01,928
No, not the pliers.

1052
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,765
Please, not the pliers.

1053
01:09:03,766 --> 01:09:06,207
I can‘t even imagine
what you‘re gonna
do with that.

1054
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:08,605
Please. Oh!

1055
01:09:08,606 --> 01:09:10,102
This little piggy...

1056
01:09:10,608 --> 01:09:12,378
went to market.

1057
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:18,582
God, I hate how you spend
so much time on this.

1058
01:09:19,881 --> 01:09:22,388
This little piggy...
Oh, boy.

1059
01:09:22,389 --> 01:09:25,083
This little piggy...
Uh-huh?

1060
01:09:26,294 --> 01:09:28,691
...went wee, wee,
wee, wee, wee...

1061
01:09:28,692 --> 01:09:30,528
fucking all the way home!

1062
01:09:30,529 --> 01:09:33,334
Oh, wow, that hurt!
That one hurt the most.

1063
01:09:34,665 --> 01:09:36,062
How you doing?

1064
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:37,898
Terribly.

1065
01:09:37,899 --> 01:09:40,572
No! Please, no.

1066
01:09:41,276 --> 01:09:43,068
Whoa, all this sucks so bad.

1067
01:09:43,069 --> 01:09:44,543
Please don‘t do that again.

1068
01:09:48,382 --> 01:09:50,614
What?

1069
01:09:50,615 --> 01:09:52,484
<i>Where the hell are you?
We‘re leaving</i>

1070
01:09:52,485 --> 01:09:53,980
<i>in thirty minutes.
Get your ass back here.</i>

1071
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:56,489
Yeah, yeah. I will wrap it up.

1072
01:10:01,956 --> 01:10:03,892
Now for my favorite part.

1073
01:10:08,732 --> 01:10:13,099
I‘m gonna keep your eyes
in a jar on my mantel.

1074
01:10:14,573 --> 01:10:17,003
Oh, wait, don‘t do that.
No. Uh, uh...

1075
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,444
Actually, don‘t do that.

1076
01:10:18,445 --> 01:10:19,940
Uh, hey, hey! Your brother...

1077
01:10:19,941 --> 01:10:21,777
Your brother told
me something...

1078
01:10:21,778 --> 01:10:24,780
before he died. He said, uh...

1079
01:10:24,781 --> 01:10:27,079
He said, um...

1080
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:30,423
"Tell my brother I‘m sorry."

1081
01:10:32,459 --> 01:10:33,592
"I‘m sorry...

1082
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:38,894
for that thing that happened
when we were kids."

1083
01:10:40,467 --> 01:10:42,733
And...

1084
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:46,373
...he said, "Tell him...

1085
01:10:46,374 --> 01:10:50,037
Tell him that Mom and Dad
always loved you the most."

1086
01:10:53,645 --> 01:10:54,745
Bullshit.

1087
01:10:56,549 --> 01:10:58,286
We never met our dad.

1088
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:00,651
Okay, I think maybe
he meant it
metaphorically.

1089
01:11:00,652 --> 01:11:03,050
Wait, no! Please, please,
please, please don‘t!

1090
01:11:05,822 --> 01:11:07,427
Roscoe?

1091
01:11:07,428 --> 01:11:09,188
No, it‘s fucking Daft Punk.

1092
01:11:10,156 --> 01:11:12,927
Of course it‘s me.

1093
01:11:15,161 --> 01:11:17,064
Thank God. I was...

1094
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:21,067
Huh.
What do you mean, "huh"?

1095
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:24,037
Uh... No, I mean, um...
it‘s just, uh...

1096
01:11:24,038 --> 01:11:25,710
Didn‘t you say...

1097
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:27,909
that you were six-foot-five

1098
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:30,010
and that you looked
like Jason Momoa?

1099
01:11:30,011 --> 01:11:32,111
I said I kind of look
like Jason Momoa.

1100
01:11:32,112 --> 01:11:33,454
Right.

1101
01:11:34,851 --> 01:11:36,984
He‘s just a very
specific-looking man.

1102
01:11:36,985 --> 01:11:39,525
How about you just say,
"Thank you for saving my life"?

1103
01:11:39,526 --> 01:11:41,990
You‘re totally right.
Absolutely. Sorry.

1104
01:11:44,927 --> 01:11:47,193
Oh, hey.
Thank you.

1105
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:49,228
Okay.

1106
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:51,406
Okay, that‘s enough.

1107
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:54,639
Look, go do whatever
you got to do

1108
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,344
and please stay alive.

1109
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:58,005
I need you
to be physically able

1110
01:11:58,006 --> 01:11:59,314
to explain
all this to the cops.

1111
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,944
Okay...
I will stay alive,
I promise.

1112
01:12:04,243 --> 01:12:06,717
You‘re gonna have to
do better than that.

1113
01:12:06,718 --> 01:12:08,015
Oh!

1114
01:12:08,016 --> 01:12:09,588
Whoa!

1115
01:12:09,589 --> 01:12:11,756
Roscoe, get something!
Right! Oh, shit. Oh.

1116
01:12:22,503 --> 01:12:24,295
You motherfuckers.
Heads up!

1117
01:12:35,307 --> 01:12:36,648
Oh, shit! Sorry.

1118
01:12:36,649 --> 01:12:38,617
It‘s fine.
Just get something else.

1119
01:12:39,817 --> 01:12:42,083
Fucker!

1120
01:12:46,527 --> 01:12:47,692
You bunch of--

1121
01:12:47,693 --> 01:12:50,090
Aw, shit, man!

1122
01:12:50,091 --> 01:12:51,829
Bear mace.
Yeah, more, more!

1123
01:12:54,766 --> 01:12:56,162
Yeah, more.

1124
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,999
Yeah, do you like this?

1125
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,407
Yeah, that‘s right, bi--

1126
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:01,200
Oh, goddamn it!

1127
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:02,806
I‘m gonna kill you!

1128
01:13:02,807 --> 01:13:04,237
Whoa!

1129
01:13:18,658 --> 01:13:21,121
I‘m gonna fucking rip
your fucking head off!

1130
01:13:21,122 --> 01:13:24,191
Just... die!

1131
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:46,950
Ah, okay.

1132
01:13:52,989 --> 01:13:55,628
Good thinking with the mace.

1133
01:13:55,629 --> 01:13:57,158
Yeah.

1134
01:14:00,898 --> 01:14:02,030
Jesus!

1135
01:14:02,031 --> 01:14:04,968
Hell of a way to go.
Uh-huh.

1136
01:14:09,808 --> 01:14:12,205
What‘d you set a timer for?

1137
01:14:12,206 --> 01:14:14,549
Um, it was for your...

1138
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,486
for your ETA or whatever.

1139
01:14:19,884 --> 01:14:21,885
I actually should pee, though.

1140
01:14:21,886 --> 01:14:23,085
Yeah.

1141
01:14:23,591 --> 01:14:24,955
Wait, what?

1142
01:14:28,695 --> 01:14:31,126
Who the fuck
are these guys, anyway?

1143
01:14:31,665 --> 01:14:32,995
No idea.

1144
01:14:32,996 --> 01:14:34,668
fans, apparently.

1145
01:14:40,707 --> 01:14:42,236
Hey, um...

1146
01:14:43,875 --> 01:14:46,140
thanks again for coming.

1147
01:14:46,141 --> 01:14:50,112
Yeah, well...
...what are friends for, right?

1148
01:14:52,213 --> 01:14:54,753
Yeah, man.
That being said...

1149
01:14:54,754 --> 01:14:56,854
I will testify against you
if need be.

1150
01:14:56,855 --> 01:14:59,252
Yeah, no, no worries.
I assumed.

1151
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:03,597
Oh, shit. It‘s the cops.

1152
01:15:03,598 --> 01:15:05,126
Well, great.

1153
01:15:05,127 --> 01:15:06,963
Tell them everything.
Let them go save her.

1154
01:15:06,964 --> 01:15:08,459
No, no, no.
They‘re not gonna listen to me.

1155
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:10,395
They think I‘m in on this.

1156
01:15:10,396 --> 01:15:12,738
No, if I go out there,
they‘ll bring me
to the station.

1157
01:15:12,739 --> 01:15:14,806
And by the time
I can convince anybody
to go after Sherry,

1158
01:15:14,807 --> 01:15:15,906
she‘ll be dead.

1159
01:15:18,074 --> 01:15:19,141
Wait a minute.

1160
01:15:19,911 --> 01:15:21,582
I think I have an idea.

1161
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:22,946
Your Harley--
it‘s still parked
out front, yeah?

1162
01:15:22,947 --> 01:15:24,047
Yeah.

1163
01:15:24,751 --> 01:15:25,851
Sort of.

1164
01:15:26,786 --> 01:15:28,150
What do you mean "sort of"?

1165
01:15:32,825 --> 01:15:34,452
Nathan Caine!

1166
01:15:34,453 --> 01:15:37,357
I need you to come out
the house with your hands up.

1167
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:41,734
Look, don‘t make
this harder than
it has to be, okay?

1168
01:15:41,735 --> 01:15:43,934
This whole town‘s
going to shit

1169
01:15:43,935 --> 01:15:46,640
‘cause the Chargers
and the Clippers
betrayed us.

1170
01:15:46,641 --> 01:15:48,807
Really? Now?

1171
01:15:48,808 --> 01:15:50,677
Seriously.
Broke our heart
for what?

1172
01:15:50,678 --> 01:15:52,778
To be second fiddle
to the Rams
and the Lakers?

1173
01:15:52,779 --> 01:15:54,648
Freeze! Freeze!

1174
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:56,276
Hey!

1175
01:15:56,277 --> 01:15:59,115
Freeze! Freeze!
Hey, stop! Stop! Shit.

1176
01:16:12,029 --> 01:16:13,524
Wait, what is he doing?

1177
01:16:13,525 --> 01:16:15,361
I don‘t know.

1178
01:16:17,804 --> 01:16:19,035
Hands!

1179
01:16:19,036 --> 01:16:21,038
Let me see your hands! Hands!

1180
01:16:26,879 --> 01:16:28,209
Shit.

1181
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:29,650
Who the hell is this guy?

1182
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,047
Ha, ha, ha!

1183
01:16:31,048 --> 01:16:33,016
You‘ve been deceived,
for I am not Nate!

1184
01:16:33,017 --> 01:16:34,623
Don‘t care.

1185
01:16:36,119 --> 01:16:39,726
But who you are
is somebody...

1186
01:16:39,727 --> 01:16:42,388
who‘s about
to go to jail.
No, no, wait, wait!

1187
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:44,698
I can help you! I can help you!
I know where Nate‘s going.

1188
01:16:44,699 --> 01:16:46,491
Yeah? Start talking then.
Okay, okay,

1189
01:16:46,492 --> 01:16:48,636
but could we have
a no-kicking policy
from this point on?

1190
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:50,463
Where is he?

1191
01:17:03,245 --> 01:17:05,313
All right, come on! Time to go!

1192
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,793
Where is your jumpsuit?
I‘m not doing this, Simon.

1193
01:17:14,091 --> 01:17:15,730
Not doing what?

1194
01:17:16,588 --> 01:17:17,996
It‘s already done.

1195
01:17:19,591 --> 01:17:21,230
Can‘t do it.

1196
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:22,935
Oh, fuck off.

1197
01:17:24,937 --> 01:17:28,434
Since when did you grow
a conscience anyway?

1198
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:31,206
I mean, what about
all the other jobs we‘ve done?

1199
01:17:31,207 --> 01:17:32,878
We‘ve killed
people before.
No.

1200
01:17:32,879 --> 01:17:35,782
No. You‘ve killed people
before, Simon. You.

1201
01:17:35,783 --> 01:17:37,345
Not me. I‘m not like you.

1202
01:17:40,282 --> 01:17:42,019
The thing is...

1203
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:44,319
you‘re not a better person
than I am.

1204
01:17:45,122 --> 01:17:46,584
Not even a little bit.

1205
01:17:46,585 --> 01:17:48,323
‘Cause you won‘t admit
what you are.

1206
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:54,164
You think all this fake remorse
is gonna save your soul? Hm?

1207
01:17:56,001 --> 01:17:57,397
It‘s bullshit...

1208
01:17:57,398 --> 01:17:58,938
Simon.

1209
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,501
...and you know it.

1210
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,505
Drop the gun!

1211
01:18:06,308 --> 01:18:07,638
Oh, my God. Nate.

1212
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:09,278
I‘m not gonna
ask you again.

1213
01:18:10,576 --> 01:18:11,819
Okay.

1214
01:18:19,255 --> 01:18:20,652
You okay, Sherry?

1215
01:18:23,259 --> 01:18:24,325
Um...

1216
01:18:24,326 --> 01:18:25,964
I‘m sorry,

1217
01:18:25,965 --> 01:18:27,395
who the fuck are you?

1218
01:18:28,627 --> 01:18:30,430
I‘m the guy that killed
your friends.

1219
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:33,466
So if you don‘t want
to wind up like them,

1220
01:18:33,467 --> 01:18:35,468
I suggest you let her go,

1221
01:18:35,469 --> 01:18:37,042
and you get the hell out
of here.

1222
01:18:39,011 --> 01:18:41,607
Oh, my God.

1223
01:18:42,674 --> 01:18:45,919
Oh, my fucking God.

1224
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:49,054
Simon, don‘t.

1225
01:18:52,024 --> 01:18:55,159
You‘re the guy
from the bank, right?

1226
01:18:58,998 --> 01:19:01,032
Okay.

1227
01:19:01,033 --> 01:19:03,629
This is legitimately
the funniest thing
that‘s ever happened to me.

1228
01:19:04,839 --> 01:19:08,337
You‘ve been tailing us
to try to save... Sherry.

1229
01:19:09,206 --> 01:19:11,208
Is that right?

1230
01:19:11,945 --> 01:19:13,308
Uh...

1231
01:19:13,309 --> 01:19:15,674
I hate to break it
to you, bud, but...

1232
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:19,887
she‘s my fucking sister.

1233
01:19:24,892 --> 01:19:27,652
She played you,
man. Yeah.

1234
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:35,836
You thought
that she had feelings for you.

1235
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:37,938
Stop, don‘t. Nate, I‘m...

1236
01:19:39,203 --> 01:19:40,566
<i>I‘m so sorry, okay?</i>

1237
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:43,371
I never meant
for you to... to...

1238
01:19:43,372 --> 01:19:45,076
Look, everything
that happened between us,

1239
01:19:45,077 --> 01:19:46,880
I meant it, okay?
It was real, I swear.

1240
01:19:46,881 --> 01:19:48,882
Oh, what a load of horseshit!

1241
01:19:48,883 --> 01:19:50,675
Look, man,

1242
01:19:50,676 --> 01:19:52,986
<i>you‘re pointing the gun
at the wrong bank robber, dude.</i>

1243
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,956
You should be shooting her.

1244
01:19:57,353 --> 01:19:58,893
So, now listen.

1245
01:20:01,093 --> 01:20:03,721
Why don‘t you just
get out of here, man. Okay?

1246
01:20:03,722 --> 01:20:06,559
What are you doing?

1247
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,869
Get yourself
to the urgent care,

1248
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:11,168
and just forget all about this.

1249
01:20:11,169 --> 01:20:12,268
Simon, stop it.

1250
01:20:12,269 --> 01:20:13,731
Get over it.

1251
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:50,043
I‘ll give it to you,
bank boy.

1252
01:20:50,604 --> 01:20:52,078
You can take a punch.

1253
01:20:56,709 --> 01:20:58,776
Let‘s see how you do...

1254
01:20:58,777 --> 01:21:00,987
...under a little pressure.

1255
01:21:00,988 --> 01:21:02,582
Perfect.

1256
01:21:09,128 --> 01:21:10,789
Simon, stop it!

1257
01:21:12,758 --> 01:21:13,869
It‘s not
fucking funny. Stop it!

1258
01:21:17,334 --> 01:21:18,906
Stop!

1259
01:21:21,437 --> 01:21:22,635
Stop!

1260
01:21:24,341 --> 01:21:26,111
What the hell you doing?
What are you doing?

1261
01:21:26,112 --> 01:21:27,244
Are you just gonna
crush his head?

1262
01:21:27,245 --> 01:21:28,949
Well, he started it!

1263
01:21:31,348 --> 01:21:32,678
Just go.

1264
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:34,350
Honestly, just go!
Take the money and go!

1265
01:21:34,351 --> 01:21:35,846
I‘m gonna stay with him.

1266
01:21:35,847 --> 01:21:38,090
You‘re gonna stay
with that guy?

1267
01:21:38,091 --> 01:21:39,487
Yeah.

1268
01:21:39,488 --> 01:21:40,819
Sherry.

1269
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:43,525
Come on!

1270
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:48,035
I don‘t even
know you anymore.

1271
01:21:52,039 --> 01:21:53,172
Fine.

1272
01:21:53,667 --> 01:21:54,766
Hmm.

1273
01:22:03,215 --> 01:22:05,513
You won‘t do it.
Yeah?

1274
01:22:05,514 --> 01:22:06,614
You sure?

1275
01:22:07,318 --> 01:22:08,418
Mm-hmm.

1276
01:22:14,061 --> 01:22:16,195
You know what?
You‘re right.

1277
01:22:17,064 --> 01:22:18,857
You don‘t know me anymore.

1278
01:22:28,867 --> 01:22:30,869
Got him! Moving in.

1279
01:22:33,278 --> 01:22:34,983
Hands! Hands up!

1280
01:22:35,544 --> 01:22:36,985
Get them on your head.

1281
01:22:42,683 --> 01:22:44,684
This one‘s cooked.
Help this guy.

1282
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:51,658
Damn, Vespa guy was right.
He‘s pretty beat up.

1283
01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:54,926
Yeah, well, good thing
we‘re here to save his ass.

1284
01:22:56,928 --> 01:22:59,237
You‘re lucky that
you got such a good friend.

1285
01:22:59,238 --> 01:23:00,932
Little too chatty
for me, though.

1286
01:23:21,953 --> 01:23:24,460
Backup will be here in five.
They‘re still stretched thin.

1287
01:23:24,461 --> 01:23:26,429
Does that mean
I can punch out now?

1288
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:28,629
Wanda‘s gonna start
<i>It‘s a Wonderful Life</i>
without me.

1289
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:30,763
Yeah,
we‘ll just get the elves
to do your paperwork.

1290
01:23:30,764 --> 01:23:32,468
Mm-hmm. Wouldn‘t that
be amazing if we had--

1291
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:23,651
Hey, hey.

1292
01:24:23,652 --> 01:24:25,950
Show me where you‘re hurt.

1293
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,328
You‘re gonna be okay.

1294
01:24:30,329 --> 01:24:31,956
You just have to
get to a hospital.

1295
01:24:31,957 --> 01:24:33,793
I‘m gonna take your car
and go after them.

1296
01:24:33,794 --> 01:24:35,763
Like hell!
I‘m not giving you my keys.

1297
01:24:37,633 --> 01:24:39,436
Sorry.

1298
01:24:39,437 --> 01:24:40,701
Don‘t worry...

1299
01:24:40,702 --> 01:24:41,934
...I‘m gonna make sure--

1300
01:24:46,642 --> 01:24:48,181
You‘re really gonna shoot me?

1301
01:24:48,182 --> 01:24:49,744
I should, asshole.

1302
01:24:51,042 --> 01:24:53,385
But I won‘t.
You‘re taking me with you.

1303
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:58,192
Okay.

1304
01:25:07,465 --> 01:25:10,863
Uh, hey, hi.
Uh, could someone please
tell me what‘s going on?

1305
01:25:10,864 --> 01:25:13,438
Go, go, go!
We‘re gonna lose him!
Yeah, don‘t worry.

1306
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:15,406
I know where he‘s going.

1307
01:25:15,407 --> 01:25:16,869
Where who‘s going?

1308
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:18,068
Oh, we‘re on a high-speed
chase right now?

1309
01:25:27,419 --> 01:25:28,551
Fuck!

1310
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,061
Oh, shit.

1311
01:25:49,573 --> 01:25:51,673
At this speed, you won‘t be
able to make any adjustments,

1312
01:25:51,674 --> 01:25:52,905
and I don‘t know
how you drive--

1313
01:25:52,906 --> 01:25:54,677
School bus!

1314
01:26:14,367 --> 01:26:15,599
What the fuck?

1315
01:26:16,501 --> 01:26:18,128
You again?

1316
01:26:18,129 --> 01:26:20,967
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1317
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:43,758
Stroller!
Yo!

1318
01:26:43,759 --> 01:26:46,564
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

1319
01:26:47,895 --> 01:26:49,995
Jesus! Where‘d you learn
to drive like this?

1320
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:51,602
I used to boost cars.

1321
01:26:54,066 --> 01:26:55,770
What? I don‘t anymore!

1322
01:27:01,744 --> 01:27:03,712
Oh, I might be dying,

1323
01:27:03,713 --> 01:27:05,385
but I‘m gonna
kill you first.

1324
01:27:19,993 --> 01:27:21,665
Oh, shit.

1325
01:27:23,964 --> 01:27:26,098
Fuck!

1326
01:27:32,346 --> 01:27:35,008
Oh. You fucking loser.

1327
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,211
So where‘s
this son of a bitch going?

1328
01:27:41,212 --> 01:27:42,686
He‘s headed to Pier 7.

1329
01:27:43,621 --> 01:27:45,688
What for?
There‘s a boat waiting.

1330
01:27:45,689 --> 01:27:46,986
It was gonna take us south.

1331
01:27:46,987 --> 01:27:49,121
Taxi!
I can see, thank you!

1332
01:28:00,869 --> 01:28:03,036
Hey, slow down!
Stop! Stop!

1333
01:28:10,175 --> 01:28:11,582
You want to know
something funny?

1334
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:13,915
If you‘d have just stayed
in that bank,

1335
01:28:14,982 --> 01:28:17,182
Sherry would be right here
sitting next to me.

1336
01:28:20,185 --> 01:28:22,660
She‘d be just fine.

1337
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:24,794
But now?

1338
01:28:25,432 --> 01:28:26,828
Now...

1339
01:28:26,829 --> 01:28:28,567
I‘m gonna hunt her ass down.

1340
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:30,965
I promise you that.

1341
01:28:32,263 --> 01:28:33,374
Yeah, well...

1342
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:37,136
if you do find Sherry...

1343
01:28:39,347 --> 01:28:41,040
I want you to tell her
something for me, okay?

1344
01:28:41,041 --> 01:28:42,613
Oh, God.

1345
01:28:44,748 --> 01:28:47,046
You are one sorry
son of a bitch.

1346
01:28:47,047 --> 01:28:49,422
You know that?

1347
01:28:51,425 --> 01:28:53,526
Yeah. I know, right?

1348
01:28:54,461 --> 01:28:55,792
It‘s kind of my thing.

1349
01:28:56,727 --> 01:28:58,927
Listen, I want you
to tell her...

1350
01:29:01,292 --> 01:29:03,371
...that even though we didn‘t
spend a lot of time together,

1351
01:29:04,603 --> 01:29:07,540
that I always felt like we...

1352
01:29:08,442 --> 01:29:10,510
could‘ve gone...

1353
01:29:11,445 --> 01:29:12,545
What?

1354
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:16,647
What‘d you feel like?

1355
01:29:16,648 --> 01:29:18,649
What was that?

1356
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:21,586
I can‘t fucking hear you.
You‘re mumbling. Speak up!

1357
01:29:21,587 --> 01:29:23,951
Oh, sorry.
I‘ll try to be a little more...

1358
01:29:23,952 --> 01:29:25,018
clear!

1359
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:11,762
I like that you‘re making me
earn it, bank boy,

1360
01:31:11,763 --> 01:31:13,424
but we got to wrap this up.

1361
01:31:16,295 --> 01:31:17,637
Let‘s go.

1362
01:31:18,363 --> 01:31:19,803
What?

1363
01:31:19,804 --> 01:31:21,035
Fuck, I can‘t.

1364
01:31:21,036 --> 01:31:22,433
I can‘t.

1365
01:31:24,303 --> 01:31:26,514
I‘m sorry, I have to go.
Wait, wait.

1366
01:31:30,144 --> 01:31:32,179
God, I hope I live
to regret this.

1367
01:31:33,752 --> 01:31:34,852
Take it.

1368
01:31:35,853 --> 01:31:38,592
That motherfucker
shot my partner.

1369
01:31:41,254 --> 01:31:42,497
Don‘t miss.

1370
01:31:48,426 --> 01:31:50,362
And you, out!
Oh, okay.

1371
01:31:51,770 --> 01:31:52,869
Get her to a hospital.

1372
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:54,432
Sure. Yeah.
Go.

1373
01:31:56,335 --> 01:31:58,611
Oh! God, that‘s a lot
of blood. Huh.

1374
01:31:58,612 --> 01:32:00,943
At least it‘s not
a stick shift,
am I right?

1375
01:32:00,944 --> 01:32:02,440
Sorry. Bleeding to death.
Right.

1376
01:32:22,603 --> 01:32:23,834
Oh.

1377
01:32:31,073 --> 01:32:33,712
End of the line, bank boy.

1378
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:05,206
You always did fight dirty.

1379
01:33:13,984 --> 01:33:15,512
Sherry!

1380
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:18,119
Looks like I finally
found a way

1381
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:19,627
to make you
feel something, huh?

1382
01:34:02,593 --> 01:34:05,233
It‘s okay. I got you.

1383
01:34:08,137 --> 01:34:09,270
Hey, asshole.

1384
01:34:09,842 --> 01:34:11,074
Feel this.

1385
01:34:25,517 --> 01:34:27,959
Nate! Hey, Nate?

1386
01:34:28,696 --> 01:34:31,358
Nate, hey. Nate.

1387
01:34:32,062 --> 01:34:33,767
Hi.
Hey...

1388
01:34:34,229 --> 01:34:35,428
Sherry...

1389
01:34:37,705 --> 01:34:39,135
I love you.

1390
01:34:41,434 --> 01:34:43,370
You‘re really cool.

1391
01:34:47,275 --> 01:34:49,144
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

1392
01:34:49,145 --> 01:34:51,410
No. Hey! Hey!

1393
01:34:51,411 --> 01:34:52,983
Nate, please.

1394
01:34:52,984 --> 01:34:55,117
Help! We‘re over here! Please!

1395
01:34:56,922 --> 01:34:59,957
I‘m so sorry, Nate.
I‘m so sorry.

1396
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:01,255
I‘m here. I‘m right here.

1397
01:35:01,256 --> 01:35:02,895
I‘m not going anywhere,
I promise.

1398
01:35:03,588 --> 01:35:04,654
I‘m sorry.

1399
01:35:07,064 --> 01:35:08,329
I‘m sorry.

1400
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:47,532
Hey, hey, hey.

1401
01:35:47,533 --> 01:35:49,468
There he is.

1402
01:35:49,469 --> 01:35:51,536
How you feeling, bud?

1403
01:35:51,537 --> 01:35:53,043
What happened?

1404
01:35:53,044 --> 01:35:56,541
Oof. Well, you‘ve had
some major blood loss.

1405
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:58,642
Oh.
And a heart attack.

1406
01:35:58,643 --> 01:35:59,952
And a brain hemorrhage.

1407
01:36:00,887 --> 01:36:02,283
And third-degree burns.

1408
01:36:02,284 --> 01:36:04,450
And a lot of broken bones.

1409
01:36:04,451 --> 01:36:05,715
But you‘re okay now!

1410
01:36:05,716 --> 01:36:07,619
It‘s a Christmas miracle.

1411
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:10,225
It‘s Christmas?

1412
01:36:10,226 --> 01:36:11,798
It‘s actually January 11th.

1413
01:36:11,799 --> 01:36:13,657
You‘ve been in
a medically induced coma.

1414
01:36:13,658 --> 01:36:16,265
But still...
...you‘re alive!

1415
01:36:19,367 --> 01:36:22,402
Wait. Sherry.
Is she... is she okay?

1416
01:36:22,403 --> 01:36:24,174
Don‘t worry. Sherry‘s fine.

1417
01:36:24,702 --> 01:36:25,813
She‘s okay.

1418
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:27,913
Yeesh.

1419
01:36:27,914 --> 01:36:29,948
Oh. We meet again.
Hey.

1420
01:36:29,949 --> 01:36:32,082
Hey! Look who‘s up.

1421
01:36:32,083 --> 01:36:33,314
Yep.

1422
01:36:33,315 --> 01:36:35,449
You look... Um...

1423
01:36:36,824 --> 01:36:37,890
brave.

1424
01:36:37,891 --> 01:36:39,452
I‘m glad you‘re up

1425
01:36:39,453 --> 01:36:41,553
because I just came
from the courthouse.

1426
01:36:41,554 --> 01:36:44,226
You‘re looking at some
pretty serious charges here.

1427
01:36:44,227 --> 01:36:45,931
Manslaughter,
breaking and entering,

1428
01:36:45,932 --> 01:36:47,031
grand theft auto.

1429
01:36:47,032 --> 01:36:48,462
Yeah, those...

1430
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:50,562
Those sound really bad.

1431
01:36:50,563 --> 01:36:51,871
Yeah, they are.

1432
01:36:51,872 --> 01:36:52,905
There‘s enough here
to lock you up

1433
01:36:52,906 --> 01:36:54,005
until you‘re twice my age.

1434
01:36:54,006 --> 01:36:55,237
Uh-huh.

1435
01:36:55,238 --> 01:36:57,074
But you did
save a cop‘s life.

1436
01:36:57,075 --> 01:37:00,606
And you also had some pretty
persuasive character witnesses.

1437
01:37:02,278 --> 01:37:04,983
Also, you‘re a white guy
who works for a bank, so...

1438
01:37:04,984 --> 01:37:06,446
the judge took it easy
on you.

1439
01:37:06,447 --> 01:37:08,613
Six months house arrest.

1440
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:11,022
Five years probation.

1441
01:37:11,023 --> 01:37:13,124
Get a lawyer to look at that,
but it‘s a pretty good deal.

1442
01:37:14,895 --> 01:37:16,060
Oh.

1443
01:37:16,061 --> 01:37:18,228
Almost forgot the best part.

1444
01:37:20,428 --> 01:37:22,463
This is from Grace.

1445
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:25,400
My daughter.

1446
01:37:31,307 --> 01:37:32,638
Take care, Nate.

1447
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:35,673
Thank you, Detective.

1448
01:37:35,674 --> 01:37:37,148
Detective.

1449
01:37:46,487 --> 01:37:48,653
You‘re look--
Are you looking at the hand?

1450
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:51,359
Oh, the hand?
Oh, you mean your burnt-up,
crisped-up hand?

1451
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,899
Yeah. Yeah.

1452
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:54,934
I mean, it‘s...
it‘s jarring, for sure.

1453
01:37:54,935 --> 01:37:56,265
Is it the worst part?

1454
01:37:56,266 --> 01:37:57,596
I just think
they shouldn‘t have to

1455
01:37:57,597 --> 01:37:59,939
dress it up all sexy,
like in fishnets.

1456
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:01,501
It‘s a skin graft.

1457
01:38:01,502 --> 01:38:04,141
Look, I would
get a glove...
Okay.

1458
01:38:04,142 --> 01:38:05,571
...personally. Yeah.

1459
01:38:07,475 --> 01:38:09,443
<i>Prepare for pain.</i>

1460
01:38:09,444 --> 01:38:11,610
<i>This guy must
not know who he‘s dealing with.</i>

1461
01:38:11,611 --> 01:38:13,381
Okay, cast toxic cloud.

1462
01:38:13,382 --> 01:38:15,350
I‘m equipping
the blackstone armor.
I‘m going in.

1463
01:38:15,351 --> 01:38:16,989
<i>Oh, hey,
you‘re coming
on Saturday, right?</i>

1464
01:38:16,990 --> 01:38:18,155
<i>It‘s a big birthday for me.</i>

1465
01:38:18,156 --> 01:38:20,091
Yeah, man.
Wait, it‘s not...

1466
01:38:20,092 --> 01:38:21,653
it‘s not at a biker bar, is it?

1467
01:38:21,654 --> 01:38:23,820
<i>Aw, fuck you.</i>

1468
01:38:23,821 --> 01:38:26,130
Yeah, man, of course
I‘m gonna be there.

1469
01:38:28,661 --> 01:38:30,530
Oh. Oh, shit!

1470
01:38:30,531 --> 01:38:32,334
<i>Dude, just hold it
for a couple more minutes.</i>

1471
01:38:32,335 --> 01:38:34,534
<i>This guy‘s almost dead.</i>
No, dude, it‘s not that.

1472
01:38:34,535 --> 01:38:36,536
I actually have to
get ready for that dinner.

1473
01:38:36,537 --> 01:38:39,209
<i>Wow. You‘re ditching
me to go on a date.</i>

1474
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:41,475
I know, I know.
It‘s very cute and adorable,

1475
01:38:41,476 --> 01:38:44,215
and I will make this up
to you later. Goodbye.
<i>Wait, wait, wait--</i>

1476
01:38:47,779 --> 01:38:49,549
Hey, uh...

1477
01:38:49,550 --> 01:38:52,586
I can‘t believe it‘s been
a year since our first date.

1478
01:38:53,521 --> 01:38:54,818
I am...

1479
01:38:54,819 --> 01:38:57,129
so happy
I tried the pie.

1480
01:38:58,295 --> 01:38:59,395
Me too.

1481
01:39:00,231 --> 01:39:01,792
And, hey,
you even wore your tie.

1482
01:39:01,793 --> 01:39:03,860
Yeah. You noticed. Yeah.

1483
01:39:03,861 --> 01:39:05,730
It took the dry cleaners
a while

1484
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:08,865
to get the blood stains out,
but, um...
you know, they managed.

1485
01:39:08,866 --> 01:39:10,042
They did a good job.

1486
01:39:10,043 --> 01:39:11,538
Oh, wait, um...

1487
01:39:11,539 --> 01:39:12,980
Sorry, I almost forgot.

1488
01:39:18,348 --> 01:39:19,987
Oh, my God.

1489
01:39:21,714 --> 01:39:23,913
You finally figured out
the ending.

1490
01:39:23,914 --> 01:39:27,917
Felt kind of weird
to have the knight
rescuing the damsel.

1491
01:39:27,918 --> 01:39:30,965
So I had them, you know,
kind of saving each other.

1492
01:39:32,098 --> 01:39:33,230
It‘s perfect.

1493
01:39:34,331 --> 01:39:35,760
Hey!

1494
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:37,234
Button that shirt up!

1495
01:39:37,235 --> 01:39:39,038
This ain‘t no
conjugal visit, man.

1496
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:41,832
Oh, sorry. No, this isn‘t like
a sex thing. This is, uh...

1497
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:44,241
Uh-huh?
Okay, yep. Got it.

1498
01:39:44,242 --> 01:39:46,507
And I know that‘s not
an open flame I‘m seeing.

1499
01:39:46,508 --> 01:39:47,608
Nope. It‘s not.

1500
01:39:48,906 --> 01:39:51,215
Sorry.

1501
01:39:51,216 --> 01:39:52,546
Don‘t play with me.

1502
01:39:52,547 --> 01:39:53,679
I‘m not trying
to play with you, sir.

1503
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:54,779
Just shh.

1504
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,121
Is he new?

1505
01:39:56,122 --> 01:39:57,320
Uh, no.
He‘s intense.

1506
01:39:57,321 --> 01:39:58,816
Yeah.
He‘s really intense.

1507
01:39:58,817 --> 01:40:00,257
Yeah, they‘re strict here.
It‘s jail.

1508
01:40:00,258 --> 01:40:01,720
Inmate 241, time‘s up.

1509
01:40:01,721 --> 01:40:04,393
That‘s a tight
15 minutes, huh?
Yeah.

1510
01:40:04,394 --> 01:40:07,792
At least we only have to
put up with it
for another eight months.

1511
01:40:07,793 --> 01:40:10,828
Yeah, seven months, 19 days,
but who‘s counting?

1512
01:40:12,336 --> 01:40:13,930
Don‘t make me come over there!

1513
01:40:15,141 --> 01:40:16,207
You‘re gonna
get me in trouble.

1514
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:17,406
I‘m so sorry.

1515
01:40:17,407 --> 01:40:18,737
He‘s so intense.

1516
01:40:18,738 --> 01:40:20,410
I know. I got to go.
Okay.

1517
01:40:24,315 --> 01:40:26,680
I‘ll, uh, see you soon...

1518
01:40:27,318 --> 01:40:28,451
Novocaine.
