1
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,749
GUARD: Lunchtime!

2
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:46,170
The longer you animals bark, the colder your lunch gets.

3
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,089
Come on, move it out. You too, down there!

4
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,340
Hey, turkey!

5
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,358
"You schmuck.

6
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,404
Do you think I'd be stupid enough to kill myself?" Kill myself?

7
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,473
Come on!

8
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:45,166
- -

9
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,940
Here he comes.

10
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,282
Francis, the lock.

11
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,575
Let go of the handle.

12
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,744
I don't have the handle! Open it!

13
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,162
Jake, up!

14
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:06,041
Come on, move! Get on! Come on!

15
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:07,617
JAKE: Thanks, Mama.

16
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,622
MAN: Backbreak!

17
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:57,052
Okay, you guys. Let's try the victory pyramid.

18
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,511
Okay, let's go.

19
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,348
Come on. Put your arms up.

20
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,434
Smile. Good, we got it!

21
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,871
Turn that TV off. I can't hear myself think.

22
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,539
Yeah, right, Dad.

23
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,587
Huh?

24
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,604
Is the water going down, son?

25
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:38,174
Uh, nope!

26
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,385
Is it going down now?

27
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,460
CHUNK: Oh, wow, a police chase!

28
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,009
Oh, shit!

29
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,813
What the hell are we doing here?

30
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,773
Trust in your mother, boys.

31
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,318
Throw her into four-wheel drive and hold on to your hats.

32
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,993
Oh, bummer!

33
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,247
Nothing exciting ever happens around here anyway.

34
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,874
Who needs the Goon Docks?

35
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,295
Who needs this house? I can't wait to get out of here.

36
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,006
BRAND: Really?

37
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,469
No, I was just trying to "delate" myself. No, no....

38
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,512
You know....

39
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,973
Dictate myself.

40
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,434
That's delude yourself, dummy.

41
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,227
That's what I said.

42
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,778
Thanks, Brand.

43
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,114
I know how you feel, wimp.

44
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,159
I'm sure gonna miss this place too.

45
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,042
Adopted wuss.

46
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,293
MIKEY: I'm no adopted wuss!

47
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,796
I'll kill you, Brand!

48
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:24,581
BRAND: Ah, it's Mouth.

49
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,052
Hey, Mikey.

50
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,832
Yo, Mikey.

51
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,849
Hey, Mikey, seen Adrienne?

52
00:06:33,786 --> 00:06:34,786
What's going down?

53
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,936
Get your foot off the table.

54
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,480
You got it. What's going down, guys?

55
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,066
What's the matter with you guys?

56
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,985
What's the matter? What is this? A nuclear Saturday?

57
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,570
Come on, guys.

58
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,906
This is our last weekend together.

59
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,866
Last Goonie weekend.

60
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,577
We gotta be going out in style.

61
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,540
Cruising the coast, sniffing some lace...

62
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,751
...downing the brews, but no!

63
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,171
The one older brother had to go and screw it up.

64
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,760
Flunking your driver's test? I don't know what to do with you.

65
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,096
You guys, let me in!

66
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,431
MOUTH: Jerk alert.

67
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,558
It's Chunk.

68
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,687
I just saw the most amazing thing in my entire life!

69
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,647
First, do the Truffle Shuffle.

70
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,482
Come on!

71
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,151
Do it.

72
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,652
Come on!

73
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,028
Do it!

74
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,204
Cut it out, Mouth.

75
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,332
Get out.

76
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:09,237
CHUNK: Guys, thanks. Thanks a lot. You guys, you won't believe me.

77
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,240
I'm telling the truth. You turd!

78
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,117
-Flunked your driver's test. -Shut up.

79
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:18,371
Listen, you'll never believe me. There was two cop cars, okay?

80
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,583
They were chasing this four-wheel deal, a real neat ORV.

81
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,837
Bullets flying everywhere. It was the most amazing thing I ever saw!

82
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,674
More amazing than when Michael Jackson used your bathroom?

83
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,470
More amazing than when you saved those old people from that fire?

84
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,432
More amazing than when you ate your weight in Godfather's pizza?

85
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,187
Okay, Michael Jackson didn't come to my house to use the bathroom.

86
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,522
But his sister did.

87
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,068
Okay, Data, don't mess this one up.

88
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,488
Prepare for the Wings of Flight.

89
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,539
MIKEY: Screen door! DATA: Mikey! The screen door!

90
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:10,632
Hey! I bet you guys thought I was gonna drop it, huh? Ha-ha!

91
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,592
I know you'd expect that from Chunk.

92
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,010
-You idiot! -Oh, my God!

93
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,517
Look, it's not broken. It's perfect. Ha-ha! It's per--

94
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,602
-Oh, my God! -What?

95
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,313
-That's my mom's most favorite piece! -What?

96
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:26,553
MIKEY: Aah!

97
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,735
CHUNK: Oh, my God.

98
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,787
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't.

99
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:31,886
-Shut up, Mouth! -Shut up, Mouth!

100
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,614
-Any of you guys ever hear of Detroit? -No.

101
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,867
Certainly. It's where Motown started.

102
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,120
Also got the country's highest murder rate.

103
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,415
That's where we move to when we lose our house tomorrow.

104
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:46,668
You shut up about that stuff. It'll never happen. My dad'll fix it.

105
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,670
Yeah, sure he will.

106
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,673
If he gets his next 400 paychecks by tomorrow.

107
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,426
That's wrong, Brand. It won't happen!

108
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,681
-Oh, hi, Mom. -Hi, Mom.

109
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,725
Hi, hi!

110
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,893
I see Data dropped by.

111
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,771
-Hi, Mrs. Walsh. How are you? -Mrs. Walsh.

112
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,649
Boys, this is Rosalita.

113
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,278
She'll help with the packing until my arm's better.

114
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:19,451
Boys, Rosalita doesn't speak a word of English...

115
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,120
...and I know some of you took Spanish in school.

116
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,874
Well, Mrs. Walsh, I speak perfect Spanish.

117
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:30,211
If it's any help to you, I'd be glad to communicate with Rosalita.

118
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,173
You're a lifesaver, Clark. Come with us, will you?

119
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,050
Certainly, Mrs. Walsh.

120
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:39,054
MRS. WALSH: Mikey, no more potato chips. Hello, Mikey.

121
00:10:39,212 --> 00:10:40,212
BRAND: It's Brand, Ma.

122
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,019
What?

123
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,940
I wonder if she'll notice.

124
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,400
That's what I said!

125
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,653
Of course. She notices everything.

126
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,113
Pants and shirts are in the second.

127
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,368
Just throw them all into boxes. Forget the suitcases.

128
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,078
Can you translate that?

129
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,706
-Certainly, Mrs. Walsh. -That's wonderful.

130
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,012
CHUNK: Look. How's that?

131
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,224
You idiot! You glued it on upside down!

132
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,477
If God meant it that way, you'd be pissing in your faces.

133
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,853
Looks fine to me.

134
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:34,067
Rosalita, this is the attic. Mr. Walsh doesn't like anyone up here.

135
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,777
That's why it's always open.

136
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,044
This is my supply closet. You'll find brooms, dustpans, insect spray.

137
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,214
I'd like the house clean when they tear it down.

138
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,258
Clark, can you translate?

139
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:12,355
Okay, Rosie? You're gonna be very happy here.

140
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,651
Come on, Clark, we've got more to do. You're so fluent in languages.

141
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:23,616
You're so fluent in Spanish. That was so nice of you.

142
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,702
"Nice" is my middle name.

143
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,663
MRS. WALSH: I'm taking Rosalita to the supermarket.

144
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,790
I'll be back in about an hour.

145
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,254
Mikey, stay inside. Brand, if he has asthma, I don't want him in the rain.

146
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,298
He should be in a plastic bubble.

147
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,800
I'm serious. That's not funny.

148
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,472
He takes one step outside, and you are in absolutely the deepest--

149
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:46,743
Shit, Ma.

150
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,684
I don't like that language, but that's what you'll be in.

151
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,895
-And you, Data-- -"Data."

152
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,856
-Use the back door from now on. -All right.

153
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,442
What is that?

154
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,360
Oh, shit. What?

155
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,071
What is that?

156
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,450
That is a mess. I want it cleaned up, boys.

157
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,328
-Oh, yeah. Sure! -You got it.

158
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,664
One hour and I'll be back. Bye, baby. Rosie?

159
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,875
-Bye, Mrs. Walsh. -Bye.

160
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,550
You want a breathing problem? You got one.

161
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,220
What'll happen to the stuff in the attic?

162
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,263
My dad's giving it back to the museum...

163
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:31,059
...or the new assistant curly-- "Curney"--

164
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,519
-Curator. -Wait, guys.

165
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:37,482
Maybe there's stuff up there for us that we can keep from the oldsiders.

166
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,318
-Maybe there's some rich stuff! -No. No.

167
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,114
No! It's my dad's responsibility, you guys.

168
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,200
The museum's probably got a list.

169
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,494
Listen to me! That's his stuff!

170
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:59,254
BRAND: Look at this. I didn't know Dad had all this stuff up here.

171
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,675
CHUNK: Great! Look at that! Neat! MOUTH: I love it.

172
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,427
MIKEY: Come on, guys!

173
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,972
My dad doesn't want you up here.

174
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,933
You heard what my mom said about not wanting anybody up here.

175
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:17,647
Mikey, I cannot believe you actually have something this cool in your house.

176
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,232
You guys, my mom said--

177
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,609
Guys, stop. Put down the outfit, okay?

178
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,238
This is great. We only have Hanukkah decorations in our attic.

179
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,823
I don't care what you have in your--

180
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,038
Okay, you saw it, now let's go.

181
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,791
DATA: Come on, Mikey. It's cool!

182
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,669
CHUNK: I got you right where I want you!

183
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,840
It's dusty, my hay fever's acting up and you always break something.

184
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,466
MOUTH: Mikey!

185
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,343
Come here and make me feel like a woman.

186
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,013
Come on, give me a nice, wet, lickery kiss.

187
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,976
I gotcha! Get out from there, you're ruining the painting!

188
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,021
You're ruining my joke. The painting's already cracked.

189
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,320
CHUNK: Hey, Mikey? MIKEY: What?

190
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,988
CHUNK: What is all this stuff?

191
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,157
MIKEY: The museum did some-- Where'd you get this?

192
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,076
CHUNK: Right there. -They did a show. A "retropactum."

193
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,830
-Retrospective. -I said that. Don't contradict me.

194
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:20,335
It was about the history of Astoria, and these are the rejects.

195
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,004
Kind of like us, the Goonies.

196
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,839
-Yeah. -I'm not a reject.

197
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,717
Take that off. You'll get me in trouble.

198
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,720
DATA: You know how this works? CHUNK: What?

199
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,805
Laser beams!

200
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,435
MIKEY: Mouth, when you drop something, put it back up--

201
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,188
Huh. What's this?

202
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,231
Wait a second.

203
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,082
Chunk!

204
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,625
I didn't touch it.

205
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,210
I know. Get over here.

206
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,050
Hold this.

207
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,802
Why me, Mike?

208
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,721
Thanks for taking us up here. There's a real big ball...

209
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,348
...and it's got this thing--

210
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,148
-What are you doing? -Mike found a map.

211
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,610
And look. That says "1632."

212
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,070
Is that a year?

213
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,280
MOUTH: No. It's your top score on "Pole Position."

214
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,450
Yes, it's a year. It's a map of our coastline.

215
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,578
BRAND: What's all that Spanish junk right there?

216
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,498
Mouth, you said you can translate. Translate.

217
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,791
Yeah, translate it.

218
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,130
"Ye intruders beware.

219
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,924
Crushing death and grief...

220
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:55,596
...soaked with blood of the trespassing thief."

221
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,890
This map is old news.

222
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,562
Everybody went looking for that when our parents were our age.

223
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,647
Haven't you heard of him? What's his name?

224
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,607
The pirate guy. One-Eyed Willy.

225
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,818
One-Eyed Willy.

226
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,903
One-Eyed Willy!

227
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:15,408
The most famous pirate in his time. My dad told me all about him.

228
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,952
Dad'll do anything to put you to sleep.

229
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,789
No! See, One-Eyed Willy stole a treasure once.

230
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,876
-And it was full of rubies and emeralds-- -Wow.

231
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,085
And diamonds?

232
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:30,256
And diamonds. Then he loaded it onto his ship...

233
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,592
...and sailed away into the sunset.

234
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,261
Until the British king found out about it...

235
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,973
...and sent out his whole armada to go after him.

236
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,852
It took them a couple of weeks to catch up with Willy.

237
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,813
Then there was a whole big war...

238
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,400
...between the armada and Willy's ship, the Inferno.

239
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,486
During the firefight, there were...

240
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,489
...guns and cannons bursting here and there.

241
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:59,118
Then Willy fled, because he knew he'd get killed if he stayed around.

242
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,537
And then he got into this cave...

243
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,624
...and the British blew up the walls around him.

244
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,502
He got caved in, and he's been there ever since.

245
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,711
-Forever? -Forever.

246
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,962
And ever?

247
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,756
Trapped.

248
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,674
Wow.

249
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,010
You sound as corny as Dad does.

250
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,138
-My dad tells the truth. Know what he said? -What?

251
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:23,267
He said One-Eyed Willy and his bunch were down there for years.

252
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,521
-They were digging tunnels and caves. -Wow.

253
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,648
-Setting booty traps. -Booby traps.

254
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:32,360
Setting booby traps so anybody who tried to get in would die.

255
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,320
-Then he killed all his men. -Wow.

256
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,280
-Why? -Why kill all of them?

257
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,199
So they wouldn't get his treasure.

258
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,118
Wait a minute.

259
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,663
If he killed all his men, how did the map get out?

260
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:48,167
My dad said one of the guys must have gotten out with the map.

261
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:52,088
-Hey, Mikey, I believe you. MOUTH: I don't believe you at all.

262
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,843
BRAND: What did you break this time, Chunk?

263
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,389
Hey, you guys, look at this.

264
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,807
You ever hear of this guy?

265
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,601
Chester Copperpot. Look what it says.

266
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:10,815
"Chester Copperpot, missing while in pursuit of local legend.

267
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:15,444
Reclusive scavenger claims, 'I have the key...

268
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,073
...to One-Eyed Willy."'

269
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,160
Wow, do you guys realize what we could do?

270
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:26,706
Nobody ever found nothing. Why would this map be in this attic...

271
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,667
...when it could be in some safe-deposit box, right?

272
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:34,672
Right. If Chester Copperpot didn't find it, how would we find it?

273
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,508
But what if? You guys...

274
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:42,263
...what if this map can lead to One-Eyed Willy's rich stuff?

275
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,266
We wouldn't have to leave the Goon Docks. Come on.

276
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,977
I don't wanna go on any more of your Goonie adventures.

277
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,105
You guys!

278
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,900
Where are you going? You don't wanna do this?

279
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,532
1632.

280
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,871
Jerk alert.

281
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,122
BRAND: Can I help you?

282
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,375
Hello, little guys. I'm Mr. Perkins, Troy's father.

283
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,961
We know Troy, he's a cheap guy.

284
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,713
My dad's not home, Mr. Perkins.

285
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,840
Is your mommy here?

286
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:22,220
No, she's down at the market buying Pampers for all us kids.

287
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,640
Papers.

288
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:30,353
Well, you can give these papers to your father to read through and sign.

289
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,939
We'll be by to pick them up in the morning.

290
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,149
-Thank you. -Thank you.

291
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,739
-What is that? -It's Dad's business.

292
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,074
But what is it?

293
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,618
I told you it was Dad's business.

294
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,163
Look at them smiling.

295
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:54,168
They can't wait till tomorrow to foreclose on whatever it's called.

296
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,878
Trash the Goon Docks.

297
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,130
I hope they make our house a sand trap.

298
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,341
And never get their balls out.

299
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:05,388
CHUNK: You know, I think they made me lose my appetite.

300
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,910
Mikey.

301
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,627
Come on, before you catch a real cold.

302
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,217
You're sure of yourself.

303
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,344
The foreclosure is a definite.

304
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,684
Oh, God, am I depressed.

305
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,565
If I found One-Eyed Willy's rich stuff, I'd pay all my dad's bills.

306
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,900
Then he could sleep at night...

307
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,570
...instead of sitting up figuring how we can stay.

308
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,280
-Me too. -Me three.

309
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,198
-Me four. -Forget any adventures, limp lungs.

310
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:10,036
If I let you out, Mom will ground me, and I've got a date with Andy.

311
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,997
You're dreaming, dude. No way.

312
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:17,251
Her mom has to drive, and then you gotta make it with her and her mom.

313
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,128
-Shut up, Mouth. -Yeah, Mouth.

314
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,005
Shut up, Data.

315
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,675
MOUTH: Jesus!

316
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:32,141
MIKEY: What'll we do about that country club? It's killing our parents.

317
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,894
If we don't do something...

318
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,897
...there'll be a golf course where we're standing.

319
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,979
DATA: Brand, how far can you stretch that?

320
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,648
BRAND: It's not that hard.

321
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,857

-Get off me! CHUNK: I got you.

324
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,665
What are you doing?

325
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,960
It took him 376 lawn mowing jobs to pay for it.

326
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,837
It's his favorite thing in the world.

327
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,005
MOUTH: Now it's his flattest. Let's go!

I'll hit you so hard, when you wake up your clothes will be out of style! Hey!

Mikey!

Mom. You gotta let me out of here.

331

Can't you learn how to exercise like a normal kid?

332
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,332
Look! You're "hyperventrilicating." Where's your brother?

Mom!

BRAND: That's hara-kiri, Ma.

343
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:00,289
MRS. WALSH: That's exactly what I said. BRAND: What?

344
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,626
My new tires! They popped my new tires, the son of--

345
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,670
I'm gonna kill--

He's got my bike! I want my bike!

355

CHUNK: You made me go up this big hill and said you'd give me a Twinkie.

356

I'll be late for dinner, and my mom'll yell at me.

She's not gonna let me eat dinner, and she's gonna punish me!

358
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,553
Anybody got a candy bar? A Baby Ruth?

359

I can't believe it. That's it.

360
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,352
Those three rocks out there. One, two, three.

361

Mikey. Mikey.

362

Troy! You touch that mirror again, and I'll smack you in the face.

There's Brand.

364

TROY: Like the bike. ANDY: What is he doing?

365
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,087
No wonder he can't get a license.

No. Thanks anyway.

Guys?

I think I have a match. I'm sure of it.

381
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:47,122
The lighthouse, the rock and the restaurant all fit the doubloon.

382
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,377
That must mean the rich stuff is near the restaurant.

383
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,295
Wait a second.

384
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,591
Mouth, I need you to translate. I don't understand Spanish.

385

MOUTH: "Stretching feet...

...six, seven, eight, nine....

395
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,758
MIKEY: Wait a minute. Somebody's there.

396
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,850
Sixty and another 40 is an even 100.

397
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,894
Right to the restaurant. The rich stuff is there.

398
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,605
I don't know about it, Mikey.

399
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,442
Hey. It's getting late.

400
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:59,862
That's a summer place. Why is it open in the fall?

401
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:04,992
There's nothing to be scared of. Two customers went inside the place.

402
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,454
What if they're not customers? What if they're drug dealers?

403
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,247
-Drug dealers? -Ah!

ALL: Shh.

405
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:16,879
Did you see their clothes? Drug dealers don't wear polyester rags.

406
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,802
Mikey, Mikey! That sounded like gunshots.

407
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:28,432
Not the kind you hear in movies, but real ones. They're gonna kill us.

408
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,727
Turn off your brain. Somebody dropped a pot.

409
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,354
MOUTH: Yeah, yeah, they just dropped a pot!

410
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:38,108
Are you sure, Mikey? Because if you're sure, I'm sure.

411
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,986
If it's not the pots, they might try to kill us.

412
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,698
They're gonna kill us!

413
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,368
MIKEY: Shh! Chunk, shut up!

414
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,548
CHUNK: Soda pop! Boy, am I thirsty!

415
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,217
Damn it!

416
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,802
What's that?

417
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,804
MAMA: Come on, hurry up! Hurry up!

418
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,391
The cook is carrying something to the kitchen.

419
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,268
Yeah, food.

420
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,728
Don't let them see us.

421
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,240
ORV.

422
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,534
Bullet holes.

423
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,328
Bullet holes?!

Shut up, Chunk.

426
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:48,262
This is a summer restaurant? I bet it hasn't been open in 10 summers.

427
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:51,306
How long you boys been at that window?

428
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,644
Long enough to see you need about 400 roach motels in this place.

429
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:01,024
How am I supposed to create with that Smithsonian piece of shit?!

430
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,579
Jake, these boys are customers.

431
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,552
Boys...

432
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,471
...make yourselves comfortable, huh?

433
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,185
She's gonna cook you something.

434

What do you want?

435

-Lots of water. -Water, water, water.

436
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,527
Four waters. Is that all?

437
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,154
No.

438
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,656
I want veal scallopini.

439
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,576
-I want a good fettuccine Alfredo. -Shut up, Mouth!

440
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,997
A bottle of fettuccine, 1981.

441
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,626
The only thing we serve is tongue.

442
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,675
You boys like tongue?

443
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,765
That's all?

444
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,436
Sit down!

445
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,524
Are you all right, Chunk?

446
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,694
Hey, guys.

447
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:32,199
What happened to the two guys in the polyester who came before us?

448
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,202
-What happened to them? -What is it? Spit it out.

449
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,746
You guys, if we don't get out of here soon...

450
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,166
...there's gonna be some kind of hostage crisis.

451
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,880
Out in the garage, ORV, four-wheel drive...

452
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,216
...bullet holes the size of matzo ba--

453
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,344
Chunk, I'm starting to O.D. on all your bullshit stories.

454

-Yeah, shut up. -Yeah, shut up.

455
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,306
Here's your water.

456
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,684
-Thank you, sir. DATA: Thank you, ma'am.

457
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,018
I mean "ma'am."

458
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,895
MOUTH: This is supposed to be water?

459
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,981
It's wet, isn't it? Drink it!

460
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,899
Where's the men's room, please?

461
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,734
-Can't you hold it? -No.

462
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,989
Mikey, this ain't the kind of place you wanna go to the bathroom in.

463
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,991
Why not?

464
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,910
Because they might have daddy longlegs in them.

465
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:20,122
-But I gotta go to the bathroom. -Like dead things, Mikey.

466

Hey, Mikey, gotta go to the bathroom?

467

Stay to the right!

MIKEY: I know it's to the right, thank you.

I know you're down here, One-Eyed Willy. You've gotta be.

I can feel it, One-Eyed Willy. I know you're down here.

474

Oh, man, that stinks.

What the hell is that?

476
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,683
You're ruining it! Look at the feast I made you.

477
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,394
Look at the feast I made you. Wanna eat it?

478
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:28,899
Have some. You'll get something. You don't leave me any choice.

479
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,817
You don't leave me any choice!

480
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:36,698
You're just like Mom and Francis. You never let me finish.

481
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:30,710
Why can't you stay at home? I'm taking you out of here right now.

482
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,337
Let's get out of here!

483
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,006
MAMA: Get out of here!

484
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,385
And stay out!

485
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,978
Kids suck.

486
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,983
I swear on my life, they've got it.

487
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:56,319
An It! A giant It! They got it chained to the wall!

488
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,239
When it came into the light, it was all gross and distorted.

489
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,409
-The parts were all mixed around. -Like your brain?

490
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,910
Say goodbye to your pals.

491
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,745
Hey, look at that.

492
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,540
FRANCIS: Ma, why'd you have to shoot him? MAMA: He's a fed.

493
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:12,586
FRANCIS: We could've taken him to the side of a road and shot him in the brain.

494
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:16,256
JAKE: Bring him over here, Francis. FRANCIS: Don't give me "over here."

495
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,009
I'm wondering, what is in the bag?

496
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,844
Restaurant trash. Yeah.

497
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,722
You sure? That big? That much?

498
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:27,100
There were bullet holes in the car this big.

499
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,020
Mikey, come on, our parents are worried.

500
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:35,066
-It's dinnertime. Let's go home. -Home? What home?

501
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,320
In a couple more hours it ain't gonna be home anymore.

502
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,323
Come on, guys, this is our time.

503
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,701
Our last chance to see if there really is any rich stuff.

504
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,371
We've got to.

505
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,000
Get down, guys. Get down.

506
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,298
Oh, shit!

507
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:01,843
You guys scared me! Almost gave me a heart attack!

508
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:06,181
-You look better from behind, Mouth. -Wanna see something really scary?

509
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,308
BRAND: How did you get here?

510
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:12,103
We followed you guys. We were out driving with Troy.

511
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,941
-Sorry about your face. -It's okay, I was born with it.

512
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,277
-I'm kidding. -Anyway, he was being a jerk.

513
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,614
Tilting the mirror so he could look down my shirt.

514
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:26,201
-So I elbowed his lip. -You elbowed his lip?

515
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,537
-It's locked. -Thank God!

516
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,789
Wait a minute!

517
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:34,626
You know, I got some naked pictures of your mom, taking a bath.

518
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,795
-Wanna buy them? -What?!

519
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,630
MOUTH: Real cheap.

520
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,510
ALL: Thanks, Chunk.

521
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,266
-Wait here. I'll get my brother. ANDY: You'll get in trouble.

522
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,644
-Just don't leave, all right? -No way I'm staying here.

523
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,901
Shut up! We've got to get to the lowest point of the floor.

524
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,487
Lowest point, nothing. Let's go. Now!

525
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:06,434
Oh, my god!

526
00:38:06,628 --> 00:38:08,027
Oh, my god!

527
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,203
-No, Brandon. BRAND: Mikey!

528
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,839
-Oh, my God. -It was disgusting.

529
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:24,259
It jumped out from the bushes. I swear it almost killed us.

530
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,138
Please? What if we find something? A few more minutes won't hurt.

531
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,390
Come on, Mikey, we're going now.

532
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:34,352
-Brand, give them a few minutes. CHUNK: Listen to your big brother.

533
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,147
As long as you stay here with me.

534
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:41,735
-She knows what she's talking about. CHUNK: She's a dame!

535
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,998
- - Aah!

536
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,959
-Chunk, I hope that was your stomach. MIKEY: No.

537
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,211
That's the It.

538
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,672
Sounds like Kong.

539
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,841
Part of it's human.

540
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,677
Come on. Wanna see it?

541
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,764
Don't worry. It's chained to the wall.

542
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,775
Shh!

543
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,784
-I don't wanna go. -Why not? It's chained.

544
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,495
-Why not? It's chained. MIKEY: You wanted to go.

545
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,830
-Yeah, I wanted to go. MIKEY: So let's go.

546
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,542
ANDY: I don't wanna see it.

547
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,563
-Shame, shame! DATA: I know your name.

548
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,982
Come on, Brand, slip her the tongue.

549
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,985
That's disgusting. No, I can't even look.

550
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,905
CHUNK: Get me up, guys!

551
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,866
ALL: One, two, three.

552
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,660
CHUNK: Thanks. MOUTH: You're welcome.

553
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,872
Can't you smell it, guys? One-Eyed Willy really is down here.

554
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,750
We're walking right above--

555
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,586
I'm gonna build one like this one.

556
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,171
Water.

557
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,675
-Come on, we can do it. -No, wait a minute.

558
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:34,013
Right about here must've been when we said we gotta get to the lowest spot.

559
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,809
MOUTH: What are you doing talking to yourself again, Mikey? Mikey! Ow!

560
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,688
What the hell are you doing? You're gonna lose your fist!

561
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,190
BRAND: What are you doing? Give me that.

562
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:47,569
There's nothing buried there. This is the 20th century!

563
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,738
-The map says there is. -Get off it! There's nothing--

564
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,866
Lookit! I got an idea.

565
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:56,870
Let's put chocolate all over the floor and let Chunk eat through it.

566
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,540
Okay, Mouth, that's all I can stand.

567
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,377
And I can't stand no more! I got it! I got it! I got it!

568
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,548
-I don't got it. ALL: You klutz.

569
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,717
Hope it's not a deposit bottle.

570
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,552
This is ridiculous.

571
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,388
I feel like I'm babysitting, except I'm not getting paid.

572
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,308
-Listen to that. -What?

573
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:22,979
So what?

574
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,899
Sounds like my grandfather taking a leak. Thrillsville.

575
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,317
No, it's deep.

576
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:31,738
Like there's a hole or a passageway. Real deep.

577
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,573
BRAND: Get out of the way.

578
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:39,037
-Brand is being so sweet to me. -Oh, come on! Come on!

579
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,998
You're in the clouds, and we are in a basement!

580
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,921
MIKEY: I told you! Ha-ha!

581
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,714
Told you! I told you!

582
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,720
BRAND: I can feel the air. There's something down there.

583
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,889
It might be a treasure or something.

584
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,936
DATA: Hey, this is working, guys.

585
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,982
MIKEY: Brand, careful! -Are you okay?

586
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,318
I told you there was a passageway.

587
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,488
MOUTH: It's the start of the tunnel. MIKEY: Look.

588
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,626
Fifty-dollar bill.

589
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,087
Fifty-dollar bill. Fifty-dollar bill?

590
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,089
Did he say, "Fifty-dollar bill"?

591
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,423
Fifty-dollar bills!

592
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:38,137
Guys! Hundreds of them! We have money to save the Goon Docks!

593
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,896
Wait, wait. Quiet!

594
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,857
They're fake. They're bogus. They're phony.

595
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,777
I knew these people were from the ozone.

596
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,030
You get 25 years for counterfeiting!

597
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,492
-I recognize these people. BRAND: Look, it's the Fratellis.

598
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,287
-He was upstairs! -The guy who tried to sing.

599
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,330
You guys never listen to me.

600
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,667
I said there would be trouble, but you didn't listen.

601
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:11,129
You guys are crazy. You guys are self-destructive.

602
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:14,465
There's a funny farm with your names written all over it.

603
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,884
But I'm getting out of here. But--

604
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,346
I smell ice cream.

605
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,851
They got Swenson's.

606
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:28,730
They got Pralines and Cream. And they got Mississippi Mud.

607
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,024
And they got Chocolate Eruption!

608
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,860
And they got apple!

609
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,653
And they got grape!

610
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,699
They got grape and Super-Duper Chocolate Eruption and--

611
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,117
What, what?

612
00:43:46,411 --> 00:43:48,020
Aah! Aah!

613
00:43:48,053 --> 00:43:49,731
CHUNK: Aah! Aah!

614
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,796
It's a stiff!

615
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,218
DATA: The door!

616
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,069
MAMA: Somebody's been here. Door's open. FRANCIS: Shut it.

617
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,863
-I'm gonna leave the lights on. JAKE: Calm down.

618
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,412
-Pizza. -Shh.

619
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,915
-Pepperoni. -Shh.

620
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:33,127
-Ma, he's eating my pepperoni again. -You want your pepperoni? Huh?

621
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,298
Let's kill each other over the pepperoni.

622
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,301
MAMA: Put that gun away now!

623
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,595
You always take his side.

624
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:43,971
That's right.

625
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:49,686

Mikey? Mikey, come on.

628
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,286
The fireplace is the only way out.

630
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,629
It all starts here.

631
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,431
CHUNK: Guys, I'm stuck with the stiff!

632
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:31,310
Stay. Stay.

JAKE: Half the pepperoni was mine. FRANCIS: Okay, I'm sorry.

636
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:45,910
Help! Help! Help! Guys!

637
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,995
MAMA: Come on, you idiots! FRANCIS: Okay, Ma.

638
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,832
MOUTH: I'll make sure it's safe. MIKEY: Shut up.

639
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,418
-Safe. MIKEY: Shut up and go.

640
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,044
MAMA: Hurry up!

641
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:03,009
I'm not kidding! Look in the window!

642
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,727
JAKE: I'll show you that piece that--

643
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,605
FRANCIS: He does that all the time. Watch your head, Ma.

644
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,899
MIKEY: I can't find Chunk. BRAND: Where's Chunk?

645
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,445
DATA: Where's Chunk? -Chunk's up there.

646
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:26,324
JAKE: Look at this piece over here. FRANCIS: Leave it alone, Jake.

647
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:30,161
Ma, I don't want him to touch it. I worked two hours on it--

648
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,996
JAKE: You worked one. MAMA: Shut up!

649
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:37,543
Someone's been here. The cooler's broken. Go check your brother.

650
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,922
-It could've been a tremor, Ma. -I'll show you a tremor.

651
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,133
I'll go check the brother.

652
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,887
If he broke his chains, I'm not getting any more from the zoo.

653
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,348
FRANCIS: Ma, just don't upset yourself. -Hurry up!

654
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,310
MAMA: Gesundheit.

655
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,191
CHUNK: I'm cold.

656
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,071
BRAND: Chunk. Chunk, come here. -Huh?

657
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,908
What are you doing down there?

658
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,704
Go get the police.

659
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,124
We're in serious shit here. You gotta get the police.

660
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,793
CHUNK: Don't worry, I can do it.

661
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,254
BRAND: Go, get out of here.

662
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,049
MIKEY: Be careful!

663
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:28,427
BRAND: Watch it-- Oh, the window. MIKEY: Go out the window.

664
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,432
DATA: Did you see him, guys? MOUTH: Where's Chunk?

665
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,686
BRAND: He went to get the police. -Go, the Fratellis are there.

666
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,771
He's getting the police. Move!

667
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,357
FRANCIS: See, Ma? There was nothing to worry about.

668
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,694
MAMA: I knew he couldn't break them chains.

669
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:45,945
Get the body.

670
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,032
We've been walking forever. How much further is it?

671
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,951
Mouth, you stepped on my foot.

672
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,787
Now I dropped my glasses. I can't see a thing.

673
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,414
Oh, my God.

674
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:59,125
-I found your glasses. Sorry. -You broke them.

675
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,168
You broke my glasses!

676
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:05,172
Listen, I'm the oldest, so I'm in charge. First, we'll--

677
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,466
Data, do you have a light?

678
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:10,303
I said I was in charge. Data, do you have a light?

679
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,929
A light.

680
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:15,433
Sure, guys. Back up, back up.

681
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,853
Bully Blinders!

682
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,315
BRAND: All right, Data-- Ow! -Isn't that neat?

683
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:27,236
One day I was walking home with it, and two big guys stopped me--

684
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:31,365
MOUTH: Who is that? Oh, Stef, that's you. Watch out. Data!

685
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,867
MIKEY: Come on, turn it off.

686
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:38,039
Oh, Data. The only problem is the batteries don't last so long.

687
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:43,127
There's a light up ahead. Maybe we can get out that way. Let's go.

688
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:47,256
I'm not afraid of the dark. I like the dark. I love it.

689
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,676
But I hate nature. I hate nature!

690
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,679
Wait a sec! Hold it!

691
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,515
Stop! I'm just a kid!

692
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:02,313
MAN: What seems to be the problem? -Mister, I need a ride.

693
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:05,441
My friends and I had a run-in with disgusting people.

694
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:09,403
You might've heard of them, the Fratellis. We found their hideout.

695
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:14,617
Could you take me to the sheriff? I can describe all three of them.

696
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,642
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

697
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,392
FRANCIS: Will you--?

698
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:45,549
JAKE: What the hell you doing? He's only a kid. Can't you handle a kid, even?

699
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,903
-Does it work, guys? -Yeah!

700
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:56,784
I can't see. Mouth, your father's a plumber. What are these pipes?

701
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,912
These look like water pipes, guys.

702
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,747
Gas pipes.

703
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:06,585
Drainage. Maybe-- Wait a minute. Shut up for a minute!

704
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:11,257
These pipes must lead to a building or something. A foundation.

705
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:14,772
So maybe if we bang on them hard enough, if we make enough noise....

706
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,590
How are you, Duke?

707
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,759
-Hey, Gene, how are you? -Great.

708
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,793
Reverse pressure!

709
00:51:31,215 --> 00:51:32,228
Aah!

710
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,467
Daddy!

711
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,676
-Let's-- -Get out of--

712
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,720
-Here! -Like now!

713
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,974
Go, go, go!

714
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:04,537
MAMA: First, we start with the pudgy little fingers.

715
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:07,206
Then the plump little hands.

716
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,250
Then the fleshy arms.

717
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:10,447
Aah! Aah!

718
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,921
Now, tell me where your friends are.

719
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,172
In the fireplace.

720
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,465
Don't lie to me!

721
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:20,386
Honestly. We found a map over at Mikey's dad's place...

722
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,722
...that said there was buried treasure under here.

723
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,267
Don't give us none of your stories, huh?

724
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:30,146
Hey, kid. Spill your guts. Tell us everything.

725
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,647
Everything?

726
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,232
Everything.

727
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,236
Everything. Okay, I'll talk.

728
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,865
In 3rd grade, I cheated on my history exam.

729
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:44,702
In 4th grade, I stole my uncle's toupee and glued it on my face...

730
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,288
...when I played Moses in my Hebrew school play.

731
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:52,334
In 5th grade, I knocked my sister down the stairs, and I blamed our dog.

732
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,797
STEF: Wait, I can't see a thing. What am I stepping on?

733
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,048
Oh, brother.

734
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:02,052
MIKEY: Look, a lantern. Somebody must have been here before us.

735
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,305
DATA: Maybe they're still here. -I hope not.

736
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,015
Look at these cigarettes.

737
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:16,066
Ten minutes ago, Troy was looking down my shirt. Who cares? It's not wrong.

738
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,611
If I'd been smart, he'd still be looking.

739
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,946
BRAND: Listen to her. DATA: What's the matter with her?

740
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,616
BRAND: Andy, it's okay. DATA: Is she all right?

741
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,827
BRAND: Andy. Andy.

742
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:32,374
I should've let him look at my body. Don't I have a beautiful body?

743
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,126
You've got a great body.

744
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:38,172
How many years do I have before I get fat? Before my hair falls out?

745
00:53:38,388 --> 00:53:39,813
Before I look like him?

746
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:48,974
Then my mom sent me to a summer camp for fat kids.

747
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,519
Then, once during lunch, I got nuts and I pigged out...

748
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,063
...and they kicked me out!

749
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,319
-Look at him. -Don't touch it, guys.

750
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:04,907
This is one of your tricks, isn't it, One-Eyed Willy?

751
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:11,622
You must be really hiding something to go through all this trouble.

752
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:15,084
-There's nothing to worry about. -You don't understand!

753
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:16,585
Don't be afraid.

754
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:23,425
He's dead for sure. I think he's Chester Copperpot.

755
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:24,969
-Chester who? -Who?

756
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,430
Don't you remember from the attic? The news article?

757
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,183
The last guy to look for the rich stuff...

758
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:34,311
...he went in, but he never came back out.

759
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,563
That was back in 1935.

760
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:41,235
Oh, God. If he didn't make it out and he was an expert, what about us?

761
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,987
How will we get out?

762
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,572
-Don't worry about it. Calm down. -You sure?

763
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,284
-I'm positive. -How will we get out?

764
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,494
We can't be sure it's him.

765
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:51,745
I know it's him.

766
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:55,040
I bet his ID is in his wallet. Mouth, get his wallet.

767
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,086
Lou Gehrig?

768
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,840
-You get it, Mikey! -Mikey, get it.

769
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,307
It is Chester Copperpot.

770
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,935
-Oh, God. Come on. -You see? I told you.

771
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,313
We're gonna get killed too.

772
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,315
Hey, look at this.

773
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,858
Candles.

774
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:27,072
-They're gonna kill us. We're dead. -Where are you going?

775
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,742
-I'm setting booty traps. -Booby traps.

776
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:33,787
That's what I said. I'll set booby traps in case anyone follows us...

777
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,290
...like the Fratellis. We'll hear them coming.

778
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,167
-Okay, hurry up. -Good idea.

779
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,627
-Where you going? -To set booty traps.

780
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:44,590
-You mean booby traps. -That's what I said. Booby traps!

781
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,675
God, these guys....

782
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:54,558
Guys, look. It looks like a skeleton of One-Eyed Willy or something.

783
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,685
Give me that. Give me this thing.

784
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,070
ANDY: Oh, God! There's no way out of here.

785
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,280
MOUTH: No, don't, don't, don't, Brandon.

786
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,659
Hey, guys, now that we've got--

787
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:18,957
Look at this. See what I found?

788
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,054
Guys, freeze. Don't move.

789
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:35,808
Don't move. You guys, don't move back there! Don't move!

790
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:37,601
-What? MIKEY: Freeze!

791
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,190
Run, you guys, run!

792
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,739
Holy S-H-I-T!

793
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,222
That was close.

794
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,099
Man, that was close.

795
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:20,102
Wait, listen. Sounds like somebody's down there.

796
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,154
BRAND: Shut up and listen.

797
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:32,656
-Maybe it's a way out. -Or the Fratellis.

798
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:36,660
-Or Chunk got the police. -Or one of Willy's booby traps.

799
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,500
Brand, God put that rock there for a purpose....

800
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:47,713
...and I'm not so sure you should move it or anything.

801
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,883
Hello?

802
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:55,971
Bats!

803
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:04,980
Save me! They're in my hair.

804
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,524
Help! Rabies! Rabies!

805
00:58:08,294 --> 00:58:09,405
Sit! Sit!

806
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:12,321
Rabies! We're gonna get rabies!

807
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:18,410
But the worst thing I ever done, I mixed up fake puke at home...

808
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:23,207
...and I went to this movie theater, hid the puke in my jacket...

809
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:26,043
...climbed up to the balcony...

810
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:29,129
...and then I made a noise like this:

811
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,933
And then I dumped it over the side...

812
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,311
...on all the people in the audience. Then--

813
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,605
Then this was horrible.

814
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:51,360
All the people started getting sick and throwing up on each other.

815
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:54,613
I never felt so bad in my entire life.

816
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,490
I'm beginning to like him, Ma.

817
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,200
Hit puree.

818
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,244
No, I'm too young!

819
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:03,705
No! I wanna play the violin!

820
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,208
-Not my hand! MAMA: Do I get the truth?

821
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:09,670
Do I get the truth, or do you get juiced?

822
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:14,049
-What was that noise? FRANCIS: Fireplace blew.

823
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:17,803
The kid's not kidding, Ma. There's a tunnel down there.

824
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:22,474
Watch your hair! They're going for the hair!

825
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,977
Watch your face, Ma!

826
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:29,022
Hey, Mikey, if you can hear me, run!

827
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,400
Run! They're coming after you!

828
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:35,862
DATA: Hey, If we keep going this far down, we'll reach China.

829
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,657
Maybe I can go see my auntie or something.

830
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,078
This could get dangerous, Andy.

831
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,622
-You might wanna hold my hand. -Thank you.

832
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,085
-Oh, wow! -Oh, neat!

833
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,004
-That's beautiful. -Guys, look!

834
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,172
It's a beautiful waterfall!

835
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:19,573
Wow!

836
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:24,828
-Wow, it's a giant piggy bank! ANDY: We're rich!

837
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,038
MIKEY: We found it!

838
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:30,042
BRAND: Gold and silver all over the place! MIKEY: It's gold, we did it!

839
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,460
DATA: Hold the lantern.

840
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,046
Coins! Rich stuff.

841
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,381
What year was the map made?

842
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,633
I don't know.

843
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:42,012
Probably a couple hundred years before President Lincoln.

844
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,473
George Washington.

845
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,361
MOUTH: Uh, Martin Sheen.

846
01:00:47,386 --> 01:00:48,447
- ANDY: Martin Sheen? - STEF: Martin Sheen?

847
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:50,291
That's President Kennedy, you idiot!

848
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:53,565
Well, same difference! I mean, he played Kennedy once.

849
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,401
That's smart. I'm glad you're using your brain.

850
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:59,905
-At least I have a brain! -You're so stupid, Mouth.

851
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,698
MOUTH: Oh, yeah? -Yes.

852
01:01:02,705 --> 01:01:03,705
Shut up!

853
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:05,080
STEF: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

854
01:01:05,105 --> 01:01:08,439
This isn't gold. This is a wishing well. Look.

855
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,541
BRAND: Hey, it must be the old Moss Garden wishing well.

856
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:16,546
I used to believe when you threw money in, it turned into your wish.

857
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,299
-I'll take two of your coins. -That's not fair.

858
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:24,513
-Wait, wait, wait, you can't do this. -Why?

859
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,057
Because these are somebody else's wishes.

860
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,643
They're somebody else's dreams.

861
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,980
Yeah, but you know what?

862
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,651
This one, this one right here...

863
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,487
...this was my dream, my wish.

864
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:44,491
And it didn't come true. So I'm taking it back.

865
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,785
I'm taking them all back.

866
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:53,750
Come on, One-Eyed Willy, what does this have to do with the map?

867
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,253
Is this another one of your tricks?

868
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:59,464
Maybe we should keep him alive in case he isn't lying.

869
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:03,176
Good idea, Jake. Put him in with your brother.

870
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,428
Okay, Ma.

871
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,263
Come on, kid.

872
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,434
JAKE: You dropped something. MAMA: What's that?

873
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,103
What's that, a Cracker Jack prize?

874
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:14,615
Holy shit!

875
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:16,189
We found it on the map.

876
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,358
It has to do with the buried treasure.

877
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,111
Jake, look at the date on it.

878
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,405
This is an authentic doubloon.

879
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,240
Give it to me.

880
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,992
CHUNK: I told you so.

881
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:32,164
See, you guys? You never believed me. I said there was gonna be buried--

882
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,838
Troy, how far you got with Andy?

883
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,631
All the way, buddy?

884
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,342
You guys are so immature. Grow up.

885
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:47,179
-Come on, tell us. -Really.

886
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:50,098
Put it this way: I didn't make it with her yet.

887
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:52,392
And I stress "yet."

888
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:54,895
Huh?

889
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,314
What the hell?

890
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:01,193
-What'd you wish for? -To make it with Andy.

891
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,407
Hey, who's down there?

892
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,785
Troy. Hey, guys, it's Troy!

893
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:13,622
Sounds like Andy.

894
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:15,165
Andy!

895
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,000
Is that you?

896
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:20,962
Yeah, it's me. We're stuck down here. Please send down the bucket.

897
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:24,090
What the hell are you doing at the bottom of a well?

898
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:29,304
Don't ask stupid questions! We're stuck! Just send down the bucket!

899
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:33,725
See, guys? Wishes do come true.

900
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,020
All right, my hearties, follow me!

901
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,320
JAKE: Don't worry. I brought you more food.

902
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,656
Why are you locking me in here?

903
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:50,075
-You're not too tight. -Yes, it is.

904
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,619
If you get out, I'll break your legs.

905
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,080
JAKE: What are you doing?

906
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:58,041
If you sit too close to the TV, you'll screw up your eye.

907
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:00,877
Jake, leave him alone!

908
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:08,927
Come on! Let me out.

909
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:21,773
Hi, sir. My name's Lawrence.

910
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,942
Sometimes people call me Chunk.

911
01:04:35,295 --> 01:04:37,337
Help! Get me out of here!

912
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,165
JAKE: Who knows what we'll find.

913
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,625
MAMA: Okay, let's go.

914
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:44,671
Whoa, look at this. Look how deep it is down there.

915
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,047
Jake, you first.

916
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,008
I ain't gonna go first.

917
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:51,344
-Go! -Can't argue with that, Ma, all right.

918
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,388
Troy, throw the bucket down.

919
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:57,642
Hey, you guys, I'm the smallest. I wanna go first.

920
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:02,480
Get out! I'm the oldest, so I call the shots. Andy goes first.

921
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,399
Chester Copperpot.

922
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,526
Chester Copperpot.

923
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,320
Chester Copperpot!

924
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,447
Don't you see?

925
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:15,035
Don't you realize? He was a pro! He never made it this far.

926
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,288
Look how far we've come. We've got a chance.

927
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:21,499
Chance at what, Mikey? Getting killed?

928
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:26,713
Look, if we keep going, someone's really gonna get hurt. Maybe dead.

929
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,590
We gotta get the police.

930
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,383
Maybe Chunk got the police.

931
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:31,801
Maybe Chunk is dead.

932
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:36,348
Don't say that. Never say that. Goonies never say "die"!

933
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:41,102
I'm not a Goonie. I wanna go home.

934
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:46,066
I forgot. But still!

935
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:50,695
Don't you realize? The next time you see the sky...

936
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,990
...it'll be over another town.

937
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,160
The next time we take a test...

938
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:01,790
...it'll be in some other school.

939
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:07,170
Our parents, they want the bestest stuff for us.

940
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,590
But right now, they gotta do what's right for them.

941
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,760
Because it's their time. Their time!

942
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:15,303
Up there.

943
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:20,308
Down here it's our time. It's our time down here.

944
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,730
That's all over the second we ride up Troy's bucket.

945
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:08,732
Andy!

946
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,568
You Goonie!

947
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:14,112
Spread it around.

948
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,741
You try to make your frosting look rugged.

949
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,576
Chocolate.

950
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,289
Chocolate.

951
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:29,169
Want a candy bar? Look, I got a Baby Ruth.

952
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:30,545
Sir?

953
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,964
Ah! Oh!

954
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:37,844
Ruth, Ruth, Ruth, Baby Ruth.

955
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,637
I'm gonna throw it to you.

956
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:52,984
I'm sorry, sir! I tried to give it to you.

957
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,569
Oh, I'm sorry!

958
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:58,656
I'm really sorry. I'll get you a-- I'll get you a--

959
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:23,681
Jeez, mister, you're even hungrier than I am.

960
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:30,563
MAMA: Booby traps. It's only booby traps. Why you being such a sissy?

961
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,190
JAKE: Freaking kids.

962
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:42,742
-Kids must've cleaned him out. -Right before they ate him.

963
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:43,993
Stupid.

964
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:50,208
Follow them size fives.

965
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:54,129
Sloth.

966
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:56,840
Chunk.

967
01:08:57,758 --> 01:08:59,259
Sloth.

968
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,387
-Chunk. -Aah!

969
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:46,181
Man, you smell like Phys. Ed.

970
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:51,060
-Mouth, hold this. -Translate this.

971
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,355
"Copper bones.

972

Triple stones."

974
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,198
This must be copper bones.

975
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:08,119
Huh? Oh, sorry.

976
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,919
Wow, look at that.

977
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,047
Triple stones!

978
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:22,967
We got you, One-Eyed Willy. We're right behind you.

979
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:25,720
Why couldn't I have had a sister?

980
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,598
A little sister instead of that?

981
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:31,309
Westward foams.

982
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,771
DATA: No, that's too big. Try the middle one.

983
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,065
MOUTH: You guys are crazy. DATA: No, the middle one!

984
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:40,109
-It fits, Mikey! It fits! MIKEY: We got it!

985
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,987
-We got you, One-Eyed Willy. -Which way do we turn?

986
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,781
West. Counterclockwise.

987
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:45,990
Counterclockwise.

988
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:49,661
DATA: Try it, Mikey. Try it. Yeah, yeah! -Ah!

989
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,000
What the hell is that?

990
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:04,092
It's gonna fall on us!

991
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:10,348
It's one of Willy's tricks. Get out of the way!

992
01:11:16,336 --> 01:11:17,419
Data!

993
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,367
Data, please.

994
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,452
-He's gone. -Oh, no.

995
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,538
-Truly, truly gone. -Don't be dead.

996
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,210
Pinchers of Peril. You guys, I've been saved by my Pinchers of Peril.

997
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:42,755
He's alive! He's alive!

998
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:50,888
You guys, I'm in another room!

999
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:54,225
Hello, sheriff? I'm at the Lighthouse Lounge...

1000
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:57,437
...and I wanna report, well, a murder.

1001
01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:01,190
Wait a minute. Just hold on here. Is that you again, Lawrence?

1002
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:05,153
Sheriff, look, this time I'm telling you the truth.

1003
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:09,157
I'm locked inside the Fratellis' basement with this guy.

1004
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:12,493
Rocky Road?

1005
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,080
Like the time 50 Iranian terrorists...

1006
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,666
...took over the Sizzler steak houses?

1007
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,376
Sloth, get back here.

1008
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:22,420
Hold on. Sloth, what are you doing?

1009
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:27,258
Like the prank about creatures that multiply when you throw water on them?

1010
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:32,388
Sloth! Sloth! Sloth's going into the fireplace!

1011
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:35,350
Lawrence?

1012
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:39,604
-No, Sloth, it's just your echo. -Echo!

1013
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,440
No, I'll show you! Don't go down there!

1014
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:45,276
It's all dark down there, Sloth.

1015
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:47,987
It's your echo, Sloth. Echo.

1016
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,951
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1017
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:56,954
Pee break. Who's gotta go?

1018
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:58,373
-Me. -Me.

1019
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,957
-Me. -Me.

1020
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:01,542
Me.

1021
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:06,339
This is the little boys' room and that tunnel's the little girls' room.

1022
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:07,799
Let's go.

1023
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:11,636
Brand, where you going?

1024
01:13:11,845 --> 01:13:13,471
This is the men's room.

1025
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:19,102
-Where you going? -The men's room, Mikey.

1026
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:21,479
Yeah, we're going to the men's room.

1027
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:35,284
Yeah, Mikey's been through here, all right.

1028
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:48,005
Uh-oh.

1029
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:50,675
Andy, this is not the time nor the place.

1030
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:53,719
Believe me, I know what I'm doing.

1031
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,930
Brand! Brand!

1032
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:58,683
Go see what she's ragging about, will you?

1033
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:14,532
Brand? Hurry, I'm in here...

1034
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:17,326
...with my eyes closed.

1035
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:43,352
Wrong way, lover boy. It's this way.

1036
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,605
-Thanks. -Uh-huh.

1037
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,029
Okay, you kissed, now tell.

1038
01:14:55,073 --> 01:14:56,741
There's something weird.

1039
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,659
What? What is it?

1040
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,120
Does Brand wear braces?

1041
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,750
Why are you laughing?

1042
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:08,920
Stef, it was beautiful.

1043
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:12,465
Next time you kiss him, do it with your eyes open.

1044
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:15,718
It's a whole different experience.

1045
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,137
Be careful. There's a hole, I think.

1046
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,348
I think Brand was standing in it.

1047
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:25,561
Ma, after we dump the kids, how do we get out? I ain't left no trail.

1048
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:28,940
They're right around here. I can smell their bubble gum.

1049
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:32,985
Ma, look. Give you three guesses who left this rope.

1050
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:34,779
You all right?

1051
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:54,423
What, are you crazy? They're here!

1052

They're here? They're here. They're here!

1053
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:01,138
Quiet. Right down there.

You there, Ma?

Hurry up.

Data, come on!

Good enough. I can see their flashlight!

1071
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:30,561
Hi, fellas. Remember me?

1072
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,066
We just wanna get out of here.

1073

Stop or I'm gonna shoot!

Finding middle C. This isn't like my mother's Steinway.

1109
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:44,987
DATA: Do something, hurry!

1110
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:48,824
This first chord, I think, is....

1111
01:19:49,659 --> 01:19:51,118
Go on, Andy!

1112
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:59,668
My God, it's working! You did it!

1113
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:04,089
-Way to go, Andy! Way to go! -It's all coming back to me. Okay.

1114
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:07,176
A.

1115
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:12,139
-C sharp, D. -Remember the lessons, play it right!

1116
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:40,251
They're coming, guys. They're down there! They're coming out!

1117
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:43,254
-What should I do? -All right!

1118
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:49,051
They're coming.

1119
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:55,432
You guys, they look really pissed off!

1120
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:07,361
-What were you thinking? -I hit the wrong note.

1121
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:11,156
-I'm not Liberace, you know. BRAND: Listen, you're doing fine.

1122
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:15,035
Andy, I believe in you. Goonies always make mistakes.

1123
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:18,122
Just don't make any more. Come on.

1124
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,790
Where was I?

1125
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,229
- A, A flat. - MOUTH: Play it!

1126
01:21:31,511 --> 01:21:34,138
Hey, you guys, they're gone! They're not here!

1127
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:42,688
FRANCIS: Whoa!

1128
01:21:57,579 --> 01:22:01,832
I can't tell if it's an A sharp or a B flat.

1129
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:05,502
If you hit the wrong note, we'll all be flat.

1130
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:19,850
Oh, my God!

1131
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,685
MIKEY: Let's go, you guys!

1132
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,732
BRAND: Go! Go!

1133
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:28,901
Oh, my God!

1134
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:32,029
Give me the gun. Give me the gun!

1135
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:34,073
ANDY: Let's go!

1136
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:37,117
-Brand, wait! -What?

1137
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,370
-What are you doing? -The map!

1138
01:22:39,579 --> 01:22:40,788
BRAND: Let's get out of here!

1139
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:43,165
Damn it!

1140
01:22:43,434 --> 01:22:44,442
BRAND: Go, go!

1141
01:23:12,203 --> 01:23:14,328
- -

1142
01:23:32,585 --> 01:23:33,773
Shit!

1143
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:35,735
STEF: Whoo!

1144
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,344
BRAND: Geronimo!

1145
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,605
STEF: Are you okay, Mouth? Andy? MOUTH: Are you okay, Stef?

1146
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:49,857
What?

1147
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:55,821
-Oh, my God. -Oh, wow!

1148
01:24:10,837 --> 01:24:12,129
Oh, my God!

1149
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:14,798
Oh, God!

1150
01:24:15,091 --> 01:24:17,593
-Follow me. JAKE: It's too....

1151
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,471
I can't do it, Mama.

1152
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,224
Francis.

1153
01:24:25,031 --> 01:24:26,852
MAMA: Aah! Idiot!

1154
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,400
MIKEY: Hold on, you guys.

1155
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:36,820
The water's really shallow.

1156
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:45,662
MOUTH: You okay, Data?

1157
01:25:19,155 --> 01:25:21,281
You really think there's a treasure here?

1158
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:23,534
Andy, this whole ship's a treasure.

1159
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,954
Oh! Mikey, look!

1160
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:32,376
Don't worry. It's just a skeleton.

1161
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:38,924
There's gotta be gold.

1162
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,388
Data. Data's okay.

1163
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:50,060
Ah! Guys!

1164
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:52,896
Data's okay.

1165
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:57,734
Data's quite tired of falling! And Data's tired of skeletons!

1166
01:25:58,069 --> 01:26:00,988
BRAND: Why didn't you use the stairs? DATA: Use the stairs!

1167
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:02,239
Stairs!

1168
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:06,702
The stupid guys tell me to use the stairs when Data's falling.

1169
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:10,414
-If Data's hurt, nobody cares anymore. -Data's okay.

1170
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:15,210
Then some guy tells me I have stupid inventions.

1171
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:18,088
I've been spending months and months...

1172
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:20,757
...studying on them and inventing them. God!

1173
01:26:25,555 --> 01:26:28,098
-Don't touch that. -Why not? He's dead.

1174
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:30,976
ANDY: Have some respect. BRAND: Put that down.

1175
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,978
How many ships were there?

1176
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:36,815
-Billions. -Billions? Billions?!

1177
01:26:37,775 --> 01:26:40,944
Watch where you step, all right? Don't slip. Don't--

1178
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:50,621
MIKEY: Mouth, translate.

1179
01:26:50,788 --> 01:26:54,875
Translate nothing. It's a sketch of the cannonball chamber.

1180
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:56,126
Where's the gold?!

1181
01:26:56,285 --> 01:26:59,787
Where's the gold, Mikey?! I'm tired of these games!

1182
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:01,109
BRAND: Shut up!

1183
01:27:02,967 --> 01:27:04,635
ANDY: Uh-oh.

1184
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,637
I set off another trap.

1185
01:27:09,974 --> 01:27:13,810
Oh, God! I'm sorry. Are you okay? Are you guys okay?

1186
01:27:14,590 --> 01:27:15,632
Oh, my God!

1187
01:27:15,688 --> 01:27:16,813
MIKEY: It's Willy.

1188
01:27:17,815 --> 01:27:20,150
Ready? Break through.

1189
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:41,004
-What's up there? MIKEY: It's all right, Brand.

1190
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:43,340
-Just give me a second. -Okay.

1191
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,793
I know how these guys must've died.

1192
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:21,378
What a mess.

1193
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:31,638
It's Willy. One-Eyed Willy.

1194
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:42,607
Hi, Willy.

1195
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:48,739
I'm Mike Walsh. You've been expecting me...

1196
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:50,824
...haven't you?

1197
01:28:51,909 --> 01:28:53,618
I made it. I beat you.

1198
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:57,331
I got here in one piece so far.

1199
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:07,841
So...

1200
01:29:08,384 --> 01:29:12,304
...that's why they call you One-Eyed Willy, One-Eyed Willy.

1201
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:17,893
We have a lot in common, huh, Willy?

1202
01:29:20,563 --> 01:29:22,272
You know something, Willy?

1203
01:29:23,232 --> 01:29:24,900
You're the first Goonie.

1204
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:32,157
Yo.

1205
01:29:34,952 --> 01:29:35,952
Hi, guys.

1206
01:29:37,288 --> 01:29:40,457
How's it going? This is Willy.

1207
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:42,417
One-Eyed Willy.

1208
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:44,419
Say hi, Willy.

1209
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:49,341
Those are my friends, the Goonies.

1210
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:53,220
How long have you been there?

1211
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:56,723
Long enough, Mikey. Long enough.

1212
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:21,832
What are you staring at? Let's go, load up!

1213
01:30:22,041 --> 01:30:24,084
-Anything that fits in your pockets. -Right, Mikey.

1214
01:30:24,293 --> 01:30:25,585
MIKEY: Except that.

1215
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:28,839
-Why? -That's Willy's.

1216
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:32,300
Save that for Willy. Anything else.

1217
01:30:41,477 --> 01:30:43,270
MIKEY: Bye-bye, marbles.

1218
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:46,440
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

1219
01:30:46,732 --> 01:30:49,151
Hurry up! Those creeps are still after us.

1220
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:53,238
-That's right! What will we do? -I don't know. Who cares?

1221
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:56,450
-I got an idea. -What is it?

1222
01:30:56,659 --> 01:30:58,118
MIKEY: I saw it on The Hardy Boys.

1223
01:30:58,744 --> 01:31:01,413
We leave a trail of jewels into one cave...

1224
01:31:01,747 --> 01:31:03,165
...and we hide in another.

1225
01:31:03,749 --> 01:31:06,835
When the Fratellis go into that cave, we make a run for it.

1226
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:09,254
Now that sounds like a great idea!

1227
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:10,464
Yo.

1228
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:13,758
-Outside! -Okay, this is war!

1229
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:16,052
-Data, don't do anything! -No!

1230
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:17,512
I said, outside!

1231
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:21,183
-We won't be taken alive, matey! STEF: What do you mean, "we"?

1232
01:31:21,392 --> 01:31:22,559
Get Data!

1233
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:25,020
MIKEY: It's not funny! She's got a gun! -Data!

1234
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:26,688
MAMA: Come on, snap to.

1235
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:29,357
-Oh, I love that. MAMA: Come on!

1236
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:37,073
Sneaking up on me, huh?

1237
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:41,036
I know what I'm doing.

1238
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:52,881
DATA: I'm all right.

1239
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:54,341
Data's just unhappy.

1240
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:58,011
DATA: Pinchers of Power.

1241
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:01,681
-Get it off me! -Let me help you, brother.

1242
01:32:07,271 --> 01:32:08,647
MAMA: My gun! JAKE: That's it!

1243
01:32:08,856 --> 01:32:12,526
FRANCIS: All right, no more Mr. Nice Guy. Let's go!

1244
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:21,326
Empty your pockets!

1245
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:24,454
Hurry up, empty your jewels! Come on!

1246
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:33,296
You're so quiet all of a sudden. Aren't you called Mouth?

1247
01:32:33,464 --> 01:32:35,549
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

1248
01:32:41,438 --> 01:32:43,088
Oh, my God!

1249
01:32:45,476 --> 01:32:47,477
-Is that all? MOUTH: Mm-hm.

1250
01:32:47,986 --> 01:32:49,623
- -

1251
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:51,908
Oh, my God!

1252
01:32:53,221 --> 01:32:54,236
Aah!

1253
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:56,528
You gross old witch.

1254
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:03,159
You wanna play pirate? We'll play pirate. March!

1255
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:06,705
-Keep going, smarty. -I can't swim with my hands tied.

1256
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:09,124
We'll play pirates. Walk the plank!

1257
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:11,084
Get out on that plank.

1258
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:14,457
-Say goodbye to your little friends. -Brand!

1259
01:33:20,287 --> 01:33:21,291
BRAND: Get out of the way.

1260
01:33:21,877 --> 01:33:23,409
Andy!

1261
01:33:25,487 --> 01:33:27,956
Two down. Who's next?

1262
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:35,650
STEF: Ow! Will you stop pushing me?!

1263
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:39,571
-You're pulling my hair! MOUTH: You get that girl away from me.

1264
01:33:39,725 --> 01:33:41,909
Go join your friends, you weasels.

1265
01:33:42,116 --> 01:33:43,950
SLOTH: Hey, you guys!

1266

Captain Chunk says let's get the hell out of here!

Oh, shit.

Aw.

Slothy, I may have been bad.

1304
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:54,224
I may have kept you chained in that room. But it was for your good.

1305
01:36:54,725 --> 01:36:56,392
Aw.

1306
01:36:58,938 --> 01:37:00,480
I used to sing to you.

1307
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,609
When you were a little boy.

Put me down.

There's been a cave-in before. Maybe we can get through.

I can't see. Got a light?

I got the last candle. Mikey, get it.

Sorry, Dad.

1425
01:45:36,955 --> 01:45:39,165
We had our hands on the future.

1426
01:45:39,374 --> 01:45:42,084
But we blew it to save our own lives.

1427
01:45:42,294 --> 01:45:43,544
Sorry.

1428
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:48,007
That's all right. You and Brand are home safe with your mom and me.

1429
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,802
That makes us the richest people in Astoria.

1430
01:45:53,764 --> 01:45:55,097
PERKINS: Walsh...

1431
01:45:55,766 --> 01:45:59,518
...you're looking at the richest people in Astoria. Now sign it.

1432
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:11,781
I'm sure gonna miss being a Goonie.

1433
01:46:23,293 --> 01:46:24,919
What's she saying, Mouth?

1434
01:46:28,965 --> 01:46:30,716
-No pen. DATA: No pen?

1435
01:46:30,926 --> 01:46:32,301
No write.

1436
01:46:34,137 --> 01:46:35,513
No sign!

1437
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:37,932
Don't sign!

1438
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:46,315
BRAND: What's in the bag? DATA: What is it?

1439
01:46:56,868 --> 01:47:00,663
Dad! It's my marble bag! The Fratellis forgot to check it.

1440
01:47:00,872 --> 01:47:05,501
I put the jewels in it. We don't have to leave the Goon Docks!

1441
01:47:05,710 --> 01:47:10,714
There'll be no more signing today or ever again!

1442
01:47:13,593 --> 01:47:15,928
Are those jewels real? How'd you find them?

1443
01:47:16,138 --> 01:47:17,680
Were your lives in danger?

1444
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:20,516
-The octopus was scary. -Octopus?

1445
01:47:20,725 --> 01:47:23,519
-It was dangerous. -Walking the plank was scariest.

1446
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:24,854
Walking the plank?

1447
01:47:25,063 --> 01:47:28,607
-Then we found the pirate ship. -That and the pirate's treasure.

1448
01:47:28,817 --> 01:47:31,652
-We were chased by the Fratellis. SHERIFF: That's enough.

1449
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:35,197
-Telling more stories, Lawrence? CHUNK: No, this time it's for real.

1450
01:47:35,407 --> 01:47:37,366
How do you think we got the gold?

1451
01:47:38,493 --> 01:47:41,078
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

1452
01:47:41,746 --> 01:47:43,914
-Look at that. -Oh, my God.

1453
01:47:53,383 --> 01:47:55,593
Ladies and gentlemen, we're at Cauldron Point...

1454
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:58,554
...and what appears to be a pirate ship....

1455
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:19,283
Bye, Willy.

1456
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:22,036
Thanks.
