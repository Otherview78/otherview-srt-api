854
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:16,066
Ten minutes ago, Troy was looking down
my shirt. Who cares? It's not wrong.

855
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,611
If I'd been smart, he'd still be looking.

BRAND:
Andy. Andy.

859
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:32,374
I should've let him look at my body.
Don't I have a beautiful body?

860
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,126
You've got a great body.

861
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:38,172
How many years do I have before
I get fat? Before my hair falls out?

862
00:53:38,388 --> 00:53:39,813

Then my mom sent me
to a summer camp for fat kids.

00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,519
Then, once during lunch,
I got nuts and I pigged out...

867
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,063

-Don't touch it, guys.

This is one of your tricks,
isn't it, One-Eyed Willy?

Don't you remember from the attic?
The news article?

The last guy to look for the rich stuff...

877

...he went in,
but he never came back out.

878
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,563
That was back in 1935.

879
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:41,235
Oh, God. If he didn't make it out
and he was an expert, what about us?

880
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,987
How will we get out?

-I'm positive.
-How will we get out?

We can't be sure it's him.

884

I know it's him.

00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:55,040
