00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,668
<i>Who do you think</i>
<i>they are to each other?</i>

3
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,871
<i>Hm...</i>

4
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:14,906
<i>I don't know.</i>

5
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:17,876
<i>Yeah, this is a hard one.</i>

6
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:22,813
<i>I think...</i>

7
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:25,350
<i>the white guy</i>
<i>and the Asian girl</i>
<i>are a couple,</i>

8
00:01:25,484 --> 00:01:27,252
<i>and the Asian guy...</i>

9
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:29,186
<i>is her brother.</i>

10
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,124
<i>Or the Asian girl</i>
<i>and the Asian guy</i>
<i>are a couple,</i>

11
00:01:33,257 --> 00:01:37,827
<i>and the white guy</i>
<i>is their American friend.</i>

12
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:41,030
<i>They are not even talking</i>
<i>to the white guy.</i>

13
00:01:42,998 --> 00:01:44,367
<i>Maybe they</i>
<i>are tourists,</i>

14
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:46,436
<i>and the white guy</i>
<i>is their tour guide.</i>

15
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:49,304
<i>Drinking at 4:00 a.m.?</i>

16
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:51,340
<i>Yeah, you're right,</i>
<i>that makes no sense.</i>

17
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:55,144
<i>Hm. Maybe they're</i>
<i>all just colleagues?</i>

18
00:01:58,112 --> 00:01:59,679
<i>I have no idea.</i>

19
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:26,155
Na Young.

20
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:28,704
Why are you crying?

21
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:36,164
Are you crying because you got
second-best marks in the exams?

22
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:47,342
Are you mad at me
because I got first place?

23
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:50,432
Yes.

24
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:02,101
Hey! I'm always second place to you,

25
00:03:03,151 --> 00:03:04,441
but I never cry.

26
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:07,450
If I beat you for the first time ever
and you cry,

27
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,110
how do you think that makes me feel?

28
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,160
You psycho.

29
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:46,606
Don't come in!

30
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:48,476
Talk from over there.

31
00:03:49,106 --> 00:03:50,186
We decided.

32
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,906
What did you decide?

33
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,695
My name will be Michelle,
and Si Young's will be Mary.

34
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:59,615
I thought Si Young said
that she wants to be Michelle.

35
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:02,375
Why would you take your sister's name?

36
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,375
I don't have an English name I like.

37
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:07,034
Na Young, you still shouldn't take
Si Young's name.

38
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:09,874
But I hate all the names.

39
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:12,464
Let's think more about it.

40
00:04:15,253 --> 00:04:16,713
How's Leonore?

41
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:19,923
For short, Nora.

42
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:22,133
Nora.

43
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:24,643
Nora Moon.

44
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:36,401
Na Young.

45
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:38,730
Hm?
Hm?

46
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:40,571
Who do you like at school nowadays?

47
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,664
What do you want to draw?

48
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:49,566
Ah,
I'm thinking two things...
Ah, I'm thinking two things.

49
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,900
I want you to draw a tree.
I want you to draw a tree.

50
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:52,403
- Tree?
- Hm.
Tree? That's what I'm good at.

51
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:54,903
That's what
I'm good at.

52
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,208
A tree doesn't have feelers.
A tree doesn't have feelers.

53
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,799
Hae Sung.

54
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,509
Why?

55
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:05,048
He's manly.

56
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:07,758
He's manly?

57
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:11,138
Hm. Yeah. I will probably marry him.

58
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:13,558
Really?

59
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:15,017
Does he want to marry you, too?

60
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:17,727
He likes me, so he will if I tell him to.

61
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,857
Do you want to go on a date with him?

62
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:40,705
They look so good together.

63
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:48,384
Hae Sung talks about Na Young a lot.

64
00:05:51,424 --> 00:05:54,093
Na Young told me that she likes him.

65
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:00,513
We're immigrating soon.

66
00:06:03,222 --> 00:06:05,812
So I wanted to make good memories for her.

67
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:11,772
You're immigrating?

68
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,571
Yes.

69
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:22,830
But why are you immigrating?

70
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,250
Na Young's dad is a film director,

71
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,960
and you're an artist.

72
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:36,549
Why would you leave all that behind?

73
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,388
If you leave something behind,
you gain something, too.

74
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:14,763
It looks all same to me.
It all looks the same to me.

75
00:07:14,897 --> 00:07:17,332
- Black barks and white...
- What is it?
- Black barks and white...
- What is it?

76
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:20,469
This is called "blue."
This is called "blue".

77
00:07:22,537 --> 00:07:24,572
This is called "yellow".
This is called "yellow".

78
00:07:50,282 --> 00:07:51,661
You're really leaving?

79
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:52,741
Yeah.

80
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:54,251
You're never coming back?

81
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:55,411
No.

82
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:56,831
Why are you leaving?

83
00:07:57,031 --> 00:07:58,161
Because I want to.

84
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,871
Why do you want to leave?

85
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,830
Because Koreans don't win
the Nobel Prize for Literature.

86
00:08:25,148 --> 00:08:26,068
Bye!

87
00:08:26,268 --> 00:08:27,278
Na Young, take care!

88
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:28,438
Bye.

89
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:23,532
Hey.

90
00:09:27,202 --> 00:09:28,202
What?

91
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:33,621
Bye.

92
00:09:55,474 --> 00:09:57,310
- <i>Hello.</i>
<i>- Hello.</i>

93
00:09:57,443 --> 00:10:00,046
<i>My name is Nora,</i>
<i>what's your name?</i>

94
00:10:00,178 --> 00:10:02,080
My name is Michelle.

95
00:10:02,213 --> 00:10:03,348
How are you,
Michelle?

96
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:04,916
I'm fine, and you?

97
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:06,251
I'm fine, and you?

98
00:10:06,384 --> 00:10:08,020
I'm fine, and you?

99
00:10:08,152 --> 00:10:09,453
I'm fine, and you?

100
00:10:09,587 --> 00:10:10,888
I'm fine, and you?

101
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:12,122
I'm fine,
and you?

102
00:10:12,256 --> 00:10:13,791
I'm fine, and you?

103
00:10:13,924 --> 00:10:16,027
I'm fine, and you?
I'm fine, and you?

104
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,728
I'm...

105
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:21,731
<i>Toronto Pearson</i>
<i>International Airport...</i>

106
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,810
<i>Toronto Pearson</i>
<i>International...</i>
Na Young, Si Young!

107
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:36,975
Let's go.

108
00:10:37,974 --> 00:10:39,514
Hurry up!

109
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:46,187
This is from Korea.

110
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:54,561
This is our passport, and...

111
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:25,288
Whoa!

112
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:54,702
I mean,
there is so much in it
that I responded to.

113
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:57,337
But the one phrase that sticks
with me most...

114
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,840
Mm-hmm.
"The long journey...

115
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:01,475
"of rotting."

116
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:02,776
I liked it too.

117
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:05,611
We liked how you
used the long pauses.

118
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:08,359
Woah, Dong Yun...

119
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,109
He's a lawyer now.

120
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:11,949
He was a really good kid.

121
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:15,988
He helped me cover up
when I peed my pants in class.

122
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:17,908
You'd pee your pants all the time.

123
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:20,748
A bedwetter lives in New York City.

124
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:21,908
Yeah.

125
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:23,918
This bedwetter is killing it.

126
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:29,707
Who else should we look up?

127
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:33,669
- What's his name?
- Hmm?

128
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,871
<i>Hm?</i>
The boy I had a massive crush on?

129
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:38,426
I went on a date with him.

130
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:41,811
Hm...
Hmm...

131
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:44,446
<i>Uh...</i>
- Uh... Jung Hae Sung.
- Hae Sung.

132
00:14:05,783 --> 00:14:08,333
Whoa! Mom, this is crazy.

133
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:13,003
He posted on Dad's movie's
Facebook page asking for me.

134
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,582
What are you talking about?

135
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:16,172
He posted a few months ago.

136
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:17,962
"I am looking for Na Young...

137
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,672
I am her childhood friend.

138
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:21,882
I want to get in touch with her."

139
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:24,341
Wow. Really?

140
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,091
Let me call you back in a minute.

141
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:28,641
Okay.

142
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:53,641
Um...

143
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:56,778
Oh, shit.

144
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:15,266
Hae Sung! This is Na Young.

145
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:18,646
Do you remember me?

146
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:23,815
Listen...

147
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:25,395
This is a good thing...

148
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:27,445
It's a good thing!

149
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:30,155
Think of it as a blessing that you broke up,

150
00:15:30,355 --> 00:15:31,695
and consider this a new beginning.

151
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,404
There are a lot of women in the world.

152
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:38,824
Don't worry!

153
00:15:41,124 --> 00:15:43,033
Shit, I must be an idiot...

154
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,213
Why do I miss that bitch?

155
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:53,672
Of course you miss her, you moron!

156
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,719
Hm.
If you don't miss her

157
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,642
after being with her for two years,

158
00:15:58,842 --> 00:16:00,342
are you even human?

159
00:16:02,431 --> 00:16:04,561
Hey, no problem. Cry hard.

160
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,050
Hey.
Hey.

161
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:08,641
This is a good thing...

162
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:10,691
a good thing!

163
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:13,570
She didn't deserve you.
This is a good thing.

164
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,650
Hey!

165
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,359
Do you have a secret girlfriend or something?

166
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:23,579
What are you talking about?

167
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:27,869
Who's messaging you at 3:00 a.m.?

168
00:16:32,128 --> 00:16:34,208
I have no idea.

169
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,114
Huh?

170
00:17:37,262 --> 00:17:39,681
Hae Sung, wake up!

171
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,298
Thank you for this meal.

172
00:18:18,258 --> 00:18:19,637
Did you drink a lot last night?

173
00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:23,830
Hm.

174
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:25,897
Kind of.

175
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:37,616
Why are you in such a good mood?

176
00:20:31,712 --> 00:20:34,882
<i>Whoa.</i>

177
00:20:35,174 --> 00:20:36,383
It's you.

178
00:20:40,763 --> 00:20:42,053
I recognize you.

179
00:20:42,723 --> 00:20:44,023
You, too.

180
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:47,892
I didn't even know
that you remembered me.

181
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:51,482
I just looked for you as a joke...

182
00:20:52,522 --> 00:20:54,652
then I saw that you'd been looking for me.

183
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,781
It wasn't a joke for me.

184
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:58,821
I tried really hard to find you.

185
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:01,741
It looks like you changed your name?

186
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:05,081
Yeah. It's Nora now.

187
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,410
That's why I couldn't find you.

188
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,800
Can I just call you Na Young?

189
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,090
Of course.

190
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,879
But nowadays my mom
doesn't even call me Na Young.

191
00:21:18,887 --> 00:21:20,089
Oh...

192
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:22,389
It looked like you're in New York.

193
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:24,969
Yeah, I'm...

194
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:27,808
a writer here.

195
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:30,018
A playwright.

196
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,434
<i>Hm.</i>
Hmm.
Kinda like your father.

197
00:21:34,268 --> 00:21:35,357
Yeah.

198
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:37,647
Hey, that's cool.

199
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:41,042
Oh...

200
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:42,607
Hello?

201
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:45,156
Hello?

202
00:21:45,696 --> 00:21:47,116
Can you hear me? I'm here.

203
00:21:47,914 --> 00:21:49,115
Hm-mm.

204
00:21:51,116 --> 00:21:52,706
Are you home?

205
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:55,535
Yeah. I have to go to class later.

206
00:21:56,285 --> 00:22:00,835
My mom says your school is a good one.

207
00:22:01,045 --> 00:22:02,585
It's not bad.

208
00:22:03,715 --> 00:22:05,384
I guess you got good grades.

209
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:08,764
I was ordinary.

210
00:22:09,514 --> 00:22:12,264
We used to compete a lot in school.

211
00:22:12,974 --> 00:22:15,103
You cried because you lost to me.

212
00:22:15,303 --> 00:22:17,853
I lost once.

213
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:20,933
Do you still cry a lot?

214
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:23,733
No.

215
00:22:24,232 --> 00:22:25,652
Really?

216
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:27,862
You used to cry a lot back in those days.

217
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:30,282
Almost every day.

218
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:35,111
You would stay with me
whenever I was crying.

219
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:37,459
Hm.
Hmm.

220
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:39,201
Why don't you cry now?

221
00:22:39,621 --> 00:22:41,291
You can't cry in New York City?

222
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:46,129
<i>Hm...</i>
Hmm...

223
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,630
When I first immigrated,

224
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,260
I used to cry a lot,

225
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:56,009
but then I realized that nobody cared.

226
00:22:57,639 --> 00:22:58,639
I see.

227
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:04,478
What do you study at school?

228
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,918
Huh?
Uh... Engineering.

229
00:23:08,518 --> 00:23:10,528
I know nothing about that.

230
00:23:22,447 --> 00:23:23,496
I like this.

231
00:23:25,206 --> 00:23:26,246
What?

232
00:23:28,376 --> 00:23:29,416
Just...

233
00:23:31,206 --> 00:23:33,085
talking to you.

234
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:36,585
Yeah?

235
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:43,384
I'm a really fun person to talk to.

236
00:23:44,264 --> 00:23:46,014
Oh, yeah?

237
00:23:46,387 --> 00:23:48,423
Mm.
Yeah.

238
00:23:50,058 --> 00:23:51,292
<i>Hm.</i>
Hmm.

239
00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:56,773
I gotta go to class.

240
00:23:57,773 --> 00:23:59,903
Me, too. I have to eat dinner.

241
00:24:01,903 --> 00:24:03,362
You haven't eaten dinner yet?

242
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:04,902
Not yet.

243
00:24:06,105 --> 00:24:07,306
<i>Hm...</i>
Hmm... What time is it there?

244
00:24:08,674 --> 00:24:09,874
Hm.
Hmm. Midnight.

245
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,541
And you still haven't eaten?

246
00:24:12,991 --> 00:24:14,001
No.

247
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:15,711
Go and eat right now.

248
00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:18,751
I will.

249
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,050
What?

250
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:37,439
It doesn't make sense but...

251
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:41,398
I'm not sure if I can say
something like this.

252
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:44,818
What do you want to say?

253
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,487
I missed you.

254
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:06,876
Me too.

255
00:25:09,796 --> 00:25:11,965
- Hmm.
- It doesn't make any sense.

256
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,645
Umm, I really have to go now.

257
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:21,184
Class is starting soon.

258
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:24,224
Okay. Bye.

259
00:25:24,684 --> 00:25:25,854
Let's talk again.

260
00:25:26,434 --> 00:25:27,564
We should talk again.

261
00:25:27,764 --> 00:25:29,194
- I'll send you an email.
- Hmm.

262
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,181
Hm.

263
00:25:30,903 --> 00:25:32,443
- Bye.
- Bye.

264
00:26:11,729 --> 00:26:13,059
Hey.

265
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:15,019
Hey.

266
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:17,649
Is it 7:00 in the morning there?

267
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:21,488
I thought you said you never
wake up before 10:00.

268
00:26:24,158 --> 00:26:26,658
You said this is the only time
that works for you.

269
00:26:30,747 --> 00:26:32,837
Don't you have class today?

270
00:26:33,037 --> 00:26:34,037
Yeah.

271
00:26:34,877 --> 00:26:36,457
So I left home early.

272
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:40,586
How was rehearsal today?

273
00:26:43,006 --> 00:26:44,716
Your Korean is rusty.

274
00:26:47,716 --> 00:26:48,726
Hey!

275
00:26:48,925 --> 00:26:52,015
I only speak Korean with you
and my mom.

276
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,435
You said you're leaving Korea
to win the Nobel Prize.

277
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:58,435
You still want that?

278
00:27:02,797 --> 00:27:03,998
<i>Hm...</i>
Hmm...

279
00:27:04,564 --> 00:27:06,524
Nowadays,

280
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:08,943
I'm really interested in the Pulitzer.

281
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:17,623
You're the same as
the 12-year-old kid I remember.

282
00:27:18,242 --> 00:27:19,492
Greedy?

283
00:27:20,912 --> 00:27:23,332
Wants to do everything,
wants to have everything.

284
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,002
Has a terrible temper.

285
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:29,751
Exactly.

286
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:33,261
No, no, I'm kidding.

287
00:27:35,841 --> 00:27:37,970
So you're writing there
the whole month?

288
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Yeah.

289
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,060
It's an artist residency.

290
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,400
Can you see?

291
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:49,319
That's cool.

292
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:53,029
Where's Montauk?

293
00:27:53,569 --> 00:27:55,739
Hmm... From New York

294
00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:58,698
about four hours east?

295
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,157
<i>Eternal Sunshine</i>
<i>of the Spotless Mind.</i>

296
00:28:04,158 --> 00:28:05,328
Have you seen it?

297
00:28:06,688 --> 00:28:08,355
<i>What did I do?</i>

298
00:28:08,489 --> 00:28:09,723
<i>I love you so much.</i>

299
00:28:10,758 --> 00:28:12,760
<i>I'll do anything to make</i>
<i>you happy.</i>

300
00:28:12,894 --> 00:28:15,296
<i>Tell me what you want me</i>
<i>to do and I'll do it.</i>

301
00:28:18,136 --> 00:28:20,176
Would you ever come to New York?

302
00:28:22,056 --> 00:28:23,966
Why would I go to New York?

303
00:28:26,136 --> 00:28:27,685
Why are you going to China?

304
00:28:28,475 --> 00:28:29,895
To learn Mandarin.

305
00:28:30,855 --> 00:28:32,395
You should come to New York

306
00:28:32,815 --> 00:28:34,485
to learn English.

307
00:28:35,485 --> 00:28:37,484
I always wanted to learn Mandarin.

308
00:28:38,814 --> 00:28:40,734
It's also helpful for my work.

309
00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:48,613
That's good.

310
00:28:49,413 --> 00:28:51,083
That's all I know.

311
00:28:52,793 --> 00:28:53,953
Hello?

312
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,292
Hello?

313
00:29:00,752 --> 00:29:01,922
Hae Sung?

314
00:29:03,462 --> 00:29:04,552
Na Young?

315
00:29:05,512 --> 00:29:06,761
Can you hear me?

316
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:11,141
Hae Sung?

317
00:29:11,721 --> 00:29:12,891
Can you hear me?

318
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,359
We're here.

319
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:34,449
You can see all of Seoul from up here.

320
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:38,118
It's beautiful.

321
00:29:41,288 --> 00:29:43,418
Wish I were there.

322
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:47,167
We should come here together.

323
00:29:53,597 --> 00:29:54,887
I miss you.

324
00:30:05,645 --> 00:30:06,815
Hello?

325
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:31,963
Would you ever come to Seoul?

326
00:30:36,212 --> 00:30:38,012
Why would I go to Seoul?

327
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:45,763
Have you
done your homework?
Have you done your homework?

328
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:47,066
I haven't.
I haven't.

329
00:30:47,198 --> 00:30:48,666
You have to do it
for graduation.
You have to do it for graduation.

330
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,103
I got under
academic probation
last semester.
I got under academic probation
last semester.

331
00:30:53,638 --> 00:30:56,306
Hm-mm.
Class captain's
message.
- Mm-hmm.
- Class captain's message.

332
00:30:57,607 --> 00:30:59,043
Let me see
your homework.
Let me see your homework.

333
00:30:59,177 --> 00:31:00,610
Maybe next time.
Maybe next time.

334
00:31:00,744 --> 00:31:02,379
Oh. Huh?
- I'm going.
- Oh. Huh?

335
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,860
Bye.

336
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,281
What's your plan
for weekend?
What's your plan for weekend?

337
00:31:05,414 --> 00:31:07,683
Playing games.
Playing games.

338
00:31:13,868 --> 00:31:14,878
Hi.

339
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:19,208
Hi.

340
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:23,717
You're not asleep yet?

341
00:31:25,257 --> 00:31:26,347
Not yet.

342
00:31:30,717 --> 00:31:31,807
You okay?

343
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:34,936
Of course.

344
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:38,516
What did you want to talk about?

345
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:49,075
When is it possible for you
to come visit me in New York?

346
00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:54,454
A year and a half or so,

347
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,204
because of my language
exchange program and...

348
00:31:57,404 --> 00:31:59,084
You don't have to explain yourself.

349
00:32:03,163 --> 00:32:06,753
It'll be at least a year before
I can come visit you in Seoul.

350
00:32:12,343 --> 00:32:15,932
I want us to stop talking for a while.

351
00:32:21,312 --> 00:32:22,351
Why?

352
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:29,771
I immigrated twice to be here in New York.

353
00:32:31,191 --> 00:32:34,150
I want to accomplish something here.

354
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,580
I want to commit to my life here,

355
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,619
but I'm sitting around looking up
flights to Seoul instead.

356
00:32:45,249 --> 00:32:47,539
So you want to stop talking to me?

357
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:51,798
Just for now.

358
00:32:55,468 --> 00:32:58,588
It took me 12 years to find my friend.

359
00:33:02,177 --> 00:33:03,467
I'll be back before you know it.

360
00:33:04,517 --> 00:33:07,267
We're just taking a brief break.

361
00:33:22,405 --> 00:33:24,235
I think it's a good idea.

362
00:33:25,155 --> 00:33:27,455
Why am I like this?

363
00:33:35,124 --> 00:33:36,414
I'm sorry.

364
00:33:39,004 --> 00:33:40,464
What are you sorry about?

365
00:33:40,883 --> 00:33:42,803
Were we dating or something?

366
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:03,481
Okay.

367
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:05,571
Bye.

368
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:07,991
Talk to you later.

369
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,530
Okay.

370
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,950
Talk then.

371
00:38:08,028 --> 00:38:10,530
Are you okay?
We walked around a lot.
Are you okay? We walked around a lot.

372
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,632
My leg is
a bit hurt, but I'm okay.
My leg's a bit hurt, but I'm okay.

373
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:17,837
- This leg hurt?
- It's okay.
- This leg hurt?
- It's okay.

374
00:38:20,805 --> 00:38:22,707
Rock, paper, scissor.
No, thanks.
- Rock, paper, scissor.
- No, thanks.

375
00:38:49,822 --> 00:38:50,872
Hae Sung, you're late.

376
00:38:51,072 --> 00:38:52,242
We're here because of you.

377
00:38:52,452 --> 00:38:53,622
You all packed?

378
00:38:54,741 --> 00:38:55,791
Almost.

379
00:38:58,371 --> 00:38:59,831
So when are you flying out?

380
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:01,881
This Sunday.

381
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,540
So you'll be there all summer?

382
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,800
Hey, tonight we drink 'til we die.

383
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,680
Why is he like this?

384
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,639
Hell yeah!

385
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:18,729
If Hae Sung says we drink, we drink.

386
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:21,139
Another soju, please!

387
00:40:59,781 --> 00:41:01,251
Hi.

388
00:41:01,384 --> 00:41:04,086
Hi! I'm Nora.

389
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:06,754
I'm Arthur.
Nice to meet you.

390
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:09,124
When'd you get in?

391
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:11,759
This morning.

392
00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:14,895
You got
the worst room.
Right?

393
00:41:15,496 --> 00:41:16,763
I know.

394
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:16,284
<i>There is a word</i>
<i>in Korean.</i>

395
00:42:16,985 --> 00:42:18,253
In-Yun.

396
00:42:21,689 --> 00:42:23,190
<i>It means "providence."</i>

397
00:42:23,924 --> 00:42:25,693
<i>Or... "fate".</i>

398
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:29,596
<i>But it's specifically</i>

399
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,198
<i>about relationships</i>
<i>between people.</i>

400
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:37,203
<i>I think it comes from...</i>

401
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:38,905
<i>Buddhism.</i>

402
00:42:39,405 --> 00:42:40,906
<i>And...</i>

403
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:42,607
<i>reincarnation.</i>

404
00:42:44,876 --> 00:42:46,445
<i>It's an</i> "in-yun"

405
00:42:46,578 --> 00:42:50,348
<i>if two strangers even walk by</i>
<i>each other in the street</i>

406
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:53,084
<i>and their clothes</i>
<i>accidentally brush.</i>

407
00:42:53,951 --> 00:42:55,553
<i>Because...</i>

408
00:42:55,686 --> 00:42:58,689
<i>it means there must have been</i>
<i>something between them</i>

409
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:00,857
<i>in their past lives.</i>

410
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,232
<i>If two people get married...</i>

411
00:43:10,733 --> 00:43:14,804
<i>they say it's because there</i>
<i>have been 8000 layers</i>

412
00:43:14,937 --> 00:43:16,138
<i>of</i> in-yun.

413
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:19,475
<i>Over 8000 lifetimes.</i>

414
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,258
You believe in that?

415
00:43:40,893 --> 00:43:42,094
Believe what?

416
00:43:43,896 --> 00:43:45,331
That...

417
00:43:45,464 --> 00:43:48,401
You and I knew each other
in another life.

418
00:43:50,034 --> 00:43:52,570
What, because
we are sitting here...

419
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:56,040
At the same table,

420
00:43:56,174 --> 00:43:58,610
in the same city,

421
00:43:58,743 --> 00:44:00,477
at the same time?
Mm-hmm.

422
00:44:00,611 --> 00:44:02,212
Yeah, wouldn't
that make this...

423
00:44:03,514 --> 00:44:04,515
<i>In-yun?</i>

424
00:44:05,749 --> 00:44:06,950
Hm...

425
00:44:08,152 --> 00:44:09,685
Mm-mm.
Mm.

426
00:44:12,388 --> 00:44:14,457
That's just
something Koreans say

427
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:16,025
to seduce someone.

428
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,952
Hi.
Hi.

429
00:44:47,086 --> 00:44:48,320
Where you going?

430
00:44:48,754 --> 00:44:50,122
New York City.

431
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:51,256
Why're you going there?

432
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:53,392
We live there.

433
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:54,693
What's your occupation?

434
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:56,161
Writers.

435
00:44:56,295 --> 00:44:57,629
You're what?

436
00:44:57,762 --> 00:44:59,030
We're writers.

437
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,734
How long
were you visiting Toronto?

438
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:05,503
Ten days.

439
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:06,905
What was the purpose
of your visit?

440
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,439
We were visiting
her family.

441
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:13,343
Are you two related?

442
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:15,679
We're married.

443
00:45:18,981 --> 00:45:20,082
Thanks!

444
00:45:49,008 --> 00:45:51,310
<i>"If you bought</i>

And then
I started to write about...

<i>After Dinner.</i>

459
00:46:33,883 --> 00:46:36,417
Um, yeah, I mean,
it's my kind of time.

460
00:46:37,385 --> 00:46:39,420
Uh, but you're studying,
right?

461
00:46:43,204 --> 00:46:44,874
I'm hungry.

462
00:46:46,293 --> 00:46:47,561
Me, too.

463
00:46:48,463 --> 00:46:50,793
What do you want to eat?

464
00:46:52,165 --> 00:46:53,567
I don't know.

465
00:46:56,552 --> 00:46:59,302
Ah... What can I do?

466
00:47:13,451 --> 00:47:15,485
You know
what I want?
What?

467
00:47:19,723 --> 00:47:21,091
Chicken wings.

468
00:47:23,293 --> 00:47:24,428
Holy shit.

469
00:47:24,561 --> 00:47:26,696
Mm-hm. Yeah.

470
00:47:27,096 --> 00:47:28,097
Oh, genius.

471
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:29,732
Mm-hmm.
Yes.

472
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,335
Chicken wings!

473
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:34,703
Hm...

474
00:47:43,745 --> 00:47:45,145
What're you
thinking about?

475
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,148
Remember I told you
about Hae Sung?

476
00:47:49,183 --> 00:47:50,384
Oh, yeah.

477
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:52,186
Is that this week?

478
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,721
Yeah.

479
00:47:54,721 --> 00:47:56,623
Why is he
coming here again?

480
00:47:57,523 --> 00:47:58,725
I think
vacation.

481
00:48:02,776 --> 00:48:04,525
Why are you going to New York?

482
00:48:05,285 --> 00:48:06,285
Vacation.

483
00:48:06,695 --> 00:48:09,115
Rest, enjoy, have fun.

484
00:48:10,865 --> 00:48:13,165
You're not going there
to see that girl, right?

485
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,624
Who?

486
00:48:16,164 --> 00:48:18,464
Why are you pretending not to know
who I'm talking about?

487
00:48:18,794 --> 00:48:20,794
Your first love. I thought she lives there.

488
00:48:21,964 --> 00:48:24,213
You gonna see her now
that you broke up with your girlfriend?

489
00:48:24,423 --> 00:48:27,213
You think I'm nuts? She's married.

490
00:48:27,883 --> 00:48:28,883
Really?

491
00:48:32,013 --> 00:48:33,762
I think it's been about seven years.

492
00:48:36,972 --> 00:48:38,642
She married early.

493
00:48:39,732 --> 00:48:41,562
Ah, you poor bastard.

494
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:44,561
What?

495
00:48:48,741 --> 00:48:50,401
It's going to rain the whole time you're there.

496
00:48:52,321 --> 00:48:53,780
Look. "Severe thunderstorm."

497
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,910
Hey, don't forget your rain boots and raincoat.

498
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,960
It really does say, "severe thunderstorm".

499
00:49:17,429 --> 00:49:19,497
Uh, trunk? Trunk?

500
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:23,759
Hae Sung!

501
00:52:57,416 --> 00:52:59,415
Woah. It's you.

502
00:53:40,581 --> 00:53:42,081
Ah, what can I do?

503
00:54:02,059 --> 00:54:03,389
What should I say?

504
00:54:04,439 --> 00:54:05,689
I don't know.

505
00:54:08,068 --> 00:54:12,068
Was the last time we talked
12 years ago?

506
00:54:30,336 --> 00:54:33,796
Glad the weather is nice today.

507
00:54:36,545 --> 00:54:37,795
You're right.

508
00:54:51,064 --> 00:54:52,144
Should we go?

509
00:54:52,854 --> 00:54:53,854
Yes.

510
00:56:20,395 --> 00:56:23,145
Before I got married,

511
00:56:26,314 --> 00:56:28,484
I went to Korea with my husband.

512
00:56:31,064 --> 00:56:32,064
I know.

513
00:56:33,654 --> 00:56:37,613
I emailed you, but you didn't respond.

514
00:56:40,203 --> 00:56:41,953
I wanted to see you.

515
00:56:45,042 --> 00:56:46,622
I was disappointed.

516
00:56:52,712 --> 00:56:53,921
I'm sorry.

517
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:00,341
I wanted to meet your girlfriend, too.

518
00:57:01,391 --> 00:57:02,851
How are you two doing?

519
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,390
We're not together right now.

520
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:13,939
You broke up?

521
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:15,859
No.

522
00:57:18,489 --> 00:57:19,819
It's not that.

523
00:57:21,779 --> 00:57:23,868
We just need time to think.

524
00:57:27,908 --> 00:57:30,078
We just started talking about getting married.

525
00:57:33,247 --> 00:57:35,417
Do you not want to get married?

526
00:57:36,797 --> 00:57:38,087
I don't know.

527
00:57:38,287 --> 00:57:40,377
If you love her, why don't you know?

528
00:57:41,877 --> 00:57:43,216
It's a little complicated.

529
00:57:44,256 --> 00:57:45,756
What's complicated?

530
00:57:46,506 --> 00:57:48,216
The conditions are not met.

531
00:57:49,096 --> 00:57:50,886
What do you mean?

532
00:57:53,185 --> 00:57:55,065
I'm an only child.

533
00:57:55,265 --> 00:57:57,025
If you're going to marry an only son,

534
00:57:57,225 --> 00:57:59,895
he should make more money and be better.

535
00:58:00,355 --> 00:58:01,605
I'm too ordinary.

536
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:04,654
You're ordinary?

537
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:08,284
My job is ordinary,
my income is ordinary.

538
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,744
It's all ordinary.

539
00:58:11,534 --> 00:58:14,373
She should meet someone
more impressive than me.

540
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:24,792
Is it hard to get married
if you don't make a ton of money?

541
00:58:26,382 --> 00:58:28,172
At first we didn't think so,

542
00:58:28,382 --> 00:58:30,092
but then we started thinking that way.

543
00:58:37,391 --> 00:58:38,891
Want me to take a photo of you?

544
00:58:39,681 --> 00:58:40,681
Okay.

545
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,199
You look good.

546
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:13,337
Would you and your husband
come out here often on dates?

547
00:59:14,498 --> 00:59:15,499
Hm.
Hmm.

548
00:59:15,837 --> 00:59:19,637
We lived near here before
we moved to the East Village.

549
00:59:20,597 --> 00:59:22,266
We did all our dating here.

550
00:59:24,136 --> 00:59:25,766
We would fight here, too.

551
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:29,396
- You two fight?
- Oh yeah, we don't fuck around.

552
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:30,895
Why do you fight?

553
00:59:32,185 --> 00:59:33,275
Just because.

554
00:59:34,945 --> 00:59:38,615
It's like planting two trees in one pot.

555
00:59:39,825 --> 00:59:42,284
Our roots need to find their place.

556
00:59:48,784 --> 00:59:50,833
Does your husband
get along with your family?

557
00:59:51,413 --> 00:59:55,373
Yeah. He plays Hwa-Too
with them all the time.

558
00:59:55,923 --> 00:59:57,173
He plays Hwa-Too?

559
00:59:57,543 --> 00:59:58,543
Of course.

560
00:59:59,503 --> 01:00:00,672
He knows how?

561
01:00:01,382 --> 01:00:02,552
He's good.

562
01:00:04,222 --> 01:00:05,512
Is his Korean good, too?

563
01:00:06,012 --> 01:00:07,012
No.

564
01:00:07,842 --> 01:00:09,182
But he can say a few things.

565
01:00:09,382 --> 01:00:10,721
Oh, yeah?

566
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:15,521
His favorite food is Yook-Gae-Jang.

567
01:00:16,141 --> 01:00:18,941
Yook-Gae-Jung?
He's not fucking around.

568
01:00:19,561 --> 01:00:21,190
He's not fucking around.

569
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:26,990
Do you and your girlfriend...

570
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:29,490
fight?

571
01:00:29,699 --> 01:00:30,869
No.

572
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:34,579
She's not really my girlfriend right now.

573
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:39,129
You should get married well.

574
01:00:40,038 --> 01:00:41,838
You're worrying about me?

575
01:00:43,748 --> 01:00:50,257
Getting married is hard
for idealistic people like you.

576
01:00:50,467 --> 01:00:54,967
Hey, I'm not so old that you should worry.

577
01:01:30,423 --> 01:01:31,503
Hae Sung.

578
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:33,924
Hmm?
Hmm?

579
01:01:38,093 --> 01:01:40,132
Why did you look for me?

580
01:01:43,012 --> 01:01:45,367
- 12 years ago?
- Hmm.

581
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,369
Hmm.

582
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:51,851
Do you really want to know?

583
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:01,160
I just wanted to see you one more time.

584
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:03,410
I don't know.

585
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:10,869
Because you just left so suddenly...

586
01:02:11,459 --> 01:02:12,999
I was a little pissed off.

587
01:02:14,879 --> 01:02:15,959
Sorry.

588
01:02:16,589 --> 01:02:18,008
What are you sorry about?

589
01:02:19,128 --> 01:02:21,878
You're right.
There's nothing to be sorry about.

590
01:02:24,758 --> 01:02:28,097
You disappeared from my life,
and I just bam...

591
01:02:28,467 --> 01:02:30,387
found you again.

592
01:02:32,687 --> 01:02:33,937
Why would you do that?

593
01:02:37,776 --> 01:02:38,856
I don't know.

594
01:02:41,606 --> 01:02:42,606
Just because...

595
01:02:46,116 --> 01:02:48,485
You kept entering my mind
when I was in the military.

596
01:02:52,155 --> 01:02:53,495
I see.

597
01:03:06,544 --> 01:03:09,263
We were babies then.

598
01:03:10,713 --> 01:03:11,883
Right.

599
01:03:14,013 --> 01:03:16,023
And when we met 12 years ago,

600
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,102
we were babies then, too.

601
01:03:22,142 --> 01:03:24,142
We're not babies anymore.

602
01:04:05,227 --> 01:04:07,261
Hi.
Hi, my love.

603
01:04:11,232 --> 01:04:13,033
How was it?

604
01:04:17,036 --> 01:04:18,238
You were right.

605
01:04:20,573 --> 01:04:21,574
I was?

606
01:04:22,877 --> 01:04:24,110
Yeah.

607
01:04:26,512 --> 01:04:28,247
He came here to see me.

608
01:05:12,821 --> 01:05:16,691
It's so crazy to see him
be this grown-up man

609
01:05:16,824 --> 01:05:21,161
with a normal job
and a normal life.

610
01:05:21,295 --> 01:05:23,130
He's so Korean.

611
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:26,132
He still lives
with his parents

612
01:05:26,265 --> 01:05:28,501
which is really Korean.

613
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:30,871
And he has all these
really Korean views

614
01:05:31,004 --> 01:05:33,040
about everything.

615
01:05:33,172 --> 01:05:37,409
And I feel so not Korean
when I'm with him.

616
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:39,344
But also,

617
01:05:40,046 --> 01:05:42,247
in some way, more Korean?

618
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:45,717
It's so weird.

619
01:05:47,418 --> 01:05:49,086
I mean, I have Korean friends,

620
01:05:49,219 --> 01:05:52,189
but he's not, like,
Korean-American.

621
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,290
He's Korean-Korean.

622
01:05:56,961 --> 01:05:58,461
Is he attractive?

623
01:06:00,096 --> 01:06:01,431
I think so.

624
01:06:02,666 --> 01:06:04,767
He's really masculine
in this way

625
01:06:04,901 --> 01:06:06,602
that I think is so Korean.

626
01:06:10,006 --> 01:06:11,674
Are you attracted to him?

627
01:06:16,243 --> 01:06:17,679
I don't think so.

628
01:06:18,412 --> 01:06:19,781
I don't know, I mean...

629
01:06:19,915 --> 01:06:21,315
I don't think so.

630
01:06:29,589 --> 01:06:31,058
He was just this kid
in my head

631
01:06:31,191 --> 01:06:33,392
for such a long time.

632
01:06:33,525 --> 01:06:37,162
And then he was
just this image on my laptop.

633
01:06:37,296 --> 01:06:40,967
And now he's
a physical person.

634
01:06:41,101 --> 01:06:42,334
It's really intense,

635
01:06:42,467 --> 01:06:44,069
but I don't think
that that's attraction,

636
01:06:44,202 --> 01:06:46,337
I think I just
missed him a lot.

637
01:06:47,138 --> 01:06:48,641
I think I miss Seoul.

638
01:06:50,809 --> 01:06:51,877
Did he miss you?

639
01:06:53,745 --> 01:06:56,681
I think he missed
the 12-year-old crybaby

640
01:06:56,814 --> 01:06:58,515
he knew a long time ago.

641
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:01,151
You were a crybaby?

642
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:03,120
Yeah.

643
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:06,255
Most of the time, he'd have to
just stand there and watch me.

644
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,533
When is he leaving, again?

645
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:21,503
The morning after tomorrow.
Mm-hmm.

646
01:07:47,927 --> 01:07:49,428
Are you mad?

647
01:07:49,996 --> 01:07:51,195
No.

648
01:07:52,164 --> 01:07:53,431
It feels like you are.

649
01:07:53,564 --> 01:07:56,735
I don't have
a right to be mad.

650
01:07:56,868 --> 01:07:58,602
What do you mean?
Of course you do.

651
01:07:58,737 --> 01:07:59,705
No, I...

652
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:01,304
That guy flew
13 hours to be here.

653
01:08:01,438 --> 01:08:02,640
I'm not gonna tell you

654
01:08:02,773 --> 01:08:04,441
that you can't see him
or something.

655
01:08:04,574 --> 01:08:07,343
He's your childhood
sweetheart.

656
01:08:07,477 --> 01:08:09,914
And it's not like you're gonna
run away with him.

657
01:08:13,348 --> 01:08:14,651
Are you?

658
01:08:17,153 --> 01:08:18,554
Definitely.

659
01:08:18,688 --> 01:08:19,823
I'm gonna throw away
my life here and run away...

660
01:08:19,956 --> 01:08:21,422
...with him to Seoul.

661
01:08:24,525 --> 01:08:25,861
Do you even know me?

662
01:08:27,029 --> 01:08:29,765
I'm not gonna miss
my rehearsals for some dude.

663
01:08:31,364 --> 01:08:32,800
I know.

664
01:08:37,772 --> 01:08:38,973
I know you.

665
01:09:27,415 --> 01:09:28,718
What?

666
01:09:30,218 --> 01:09:34,022
I was just thinking about
what a good story this is.

667
01:09:36,091 --> 01:09:38,927
The story of Hae Sung and me?
Yeah.

668
01:09:41,128 --> 01:09:42,963
I just can't compete.

669
01:09:46,533 --> 01:09:48,035
What do you mean?

670
01:09:52,005 --> 01:09:55,041
Childhood sweethearts
who reconnect 20 years later

671
01:09:55,175 --> 01:09:57,877
only to realize they were
meant for each other.

672
01:09:58,011 --> 01:09:59,278
We're not
meant for each other.

673
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:00,646
I know.

674
01:10:01,113 --> 01:10:02,313
I know.

675
01:10:02,446 --> 01:10:03,749
In the story,

676
01:10:03,882 --> 01:10:05,217
I would be the evil
white American husband

677
01:10:05,349 --> 01:10:07,585
standing in the way
of destiny.

678
01:10:11,488 --> 01:10:13,057
Shut up.

679
01:10:13,191 --> 01:10:15,827
What do you not like about it?
Our story's just so boring.

680
01:10:17,327 --> 01:10:19,996
We met at
an artists' residency.

681
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:24,234
Slept together because we both
happened to be single.

682
01:10:24,366 --> 01:10:25,735
We realize
we both live in New York,

683
01:10:25,869 --> 01:10:29,537
so we move in together
to save money on rent.

684
01:10:29,672 --> 01:10:32,607
We got married so you could
get a green card. So...

685
01:10:32,741 --> 01:10:34,777
Oh, you make it sound
so romantic.

686
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:36,477
Right, that's
what I'm saying.

687
01:10:39,546 --> 01:10:40,882
I'm the guy
you leave in the story

688
01:10:41,015 --> 01:10:43,918
when your ex-lover
comes to take you away.

689
01:10:44,052 --> 01:10:45,753
He's not my ex-lover.

690
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:55,796
What if you met somebody else
at that residency?

691
01:10:55,929 --> 01:10:58,631
What if there was
another writer from New York

692
01:10:58,764 --> 01:11:00,967
who had also read
all the same books you had,

693
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,970
and watched
all the same movies,

694
01:11:04,103 --> 01:11:07,538
could give you
useful notes on your plays,

695
01:11:07,672 --> 01:11:11,877
and listen to you complain
about your rehearsals?

696
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:14,411
That's not how life works.
I know.

697
01:11:15,947 --> 01:11:17,115
Yeah.

698
01:11:18,048 --> 01:11:20,450
But wouldn't you be
laying here with him?

699
01:11:22,585 --> 01:11:25,555
This is my life,
and I'm living it with you.

700
01:11:28,091 --> 01:11:29,692
Are you happy with it?

701
01:11:31,794 --> 01:11:33,930
Is this what you
imagined for yourself

702
01:11:34,063 --> 01:11:35,198
when you left Seoul?

703
01:11:35,331 --> 01:11:36,699
When I was a 12-year-old?

704
01:11:36,832 --> 01:11:39,701
Yeah. Is this what
you pictured for yourself?

705
01:11:40,601 --> 01:11:42,771
Laying in bed in some...

706
01:11:43,872 --> 01:11:45,974
tiny apartment
in the East Village

707
01:11:46,108 --> 01:11:48,809
with some Jewish guy
who writes books?

708
01:11:48,943 --> 01:11:50,945
Is that what your parents
wanted for you?

709
01:11:52,113 --> 01:11:55,650
You're asking me if you,
Arthur Zaturansky,

710
01:11:55,783 --> 01:11:58,652
are the answer to
my family's immigrant dream?

711
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:01,688
Yeah.
Wow.

712
01:12:08,794 --> 01:12:11,462
This is where we ended up.

713
01:12:11,596 --> 01:12:13,866
This is where
I'm supposed to be.

714
01:12:21,272 --> 01:12:22,472
Okay.

715
01:12:25,243 --> 01:12:26,475
What?

716
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:34,117
It's just that you make
my life so much bigger.

717
01:12:34,251 --> 01:12:37,653
And I'm wondering if I do
the same thing for you.

718
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:42,524
You do.

719
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:57,871
I'm just a girl from Korea,
you know?

720
01:12:58,672 --> 01:13:01,775
Okay.

721
01:13:01,909 --> 01:13:05,012
And you're forgetting the part
where I love you.

722
01:13:06,412 --> 01:13:07,647
I don't forget that.

723
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:10,650
I have trouble
believing it sometimes.

724
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:36,873
Do you know
you only speak in Korean

725
01:13:37,007 --> 01:13:38,808
when you talk in your sleep?

726
01:13:39,743 --> 01:13:41,510
I do?
Yeah.

727
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:47,082
You never
sleep talk in English.

728
01:13:47,783 --> 01:13:49,818
You only dream in Korean.

729
01:13:53,722 --> 01:13:55,256
I didn't know that.

730
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:56,491
Yeah.

731
01:13:56,624 --> 01:13:57,892
You never told me that.

732
01:13:58,026 --> 01:14:00,595
Well, sometimes
I think it's cute.

733
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:07,234
Sometimes, I don't know,
I guess I get scared.

734
01:14:09,169 --> 01:14:10,203
Scared of what?

735
01:14:15,808 --> 01:14:18,744
You dream in a language
that I can't understand.

736
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:24,082
It's like
there's this whole place

737
01:14:24,215 --> 01:14:27,218
inside of you
where I can't go.

738
01:14:36,493 --> 01:14:39,263
I think that's why I've been
trying to learn Korean,

739
01:14:40,164 --> 01:14:42,299
even though I know
it's annoying for you.

740
01:14:43,433 --> 01:14:46,035
You want to understand me
when I'm dreaming?

741
01:14:46,335 --> 01:14:47,603
Yeah.

742
01:14:52,075 --> 01:14:54,810
I'm sure I'm just
saying gibberish.

743
01:15:25,378 --> 01:15:27,418
- Hey.
- Hey.

744
01:15:28,088 --> 01:15:29,798
Did you get home safe last night?

745
01:15:29,998 --> 01:15:31,048
Yeah.

746
01:15:31,258 --> 01:15:32,677
Sorry I'm late.

747
01:15:34,217 --> 01:15:35,467
Did you eat something?

748
01:15:36,097 --> 01:15:37,097
No.

749
01:15:44,516 --> 01:15:45,486
Eat this.

750
01:15:45,686 --> 01:15:47,396
Is it for me?

751
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:01,864
I wanted to ask you yesterday...

752
01:16:03,454 --> 01:16:05,454
What prize do you want to win nowadays?

753
01:16:06,274 --> 01:16:07,275
Hm?
Hmm?

754
01:16:07,954 --> 01:16:11,463
When you were little you wanted
to win the Nobel Prize,

755
01:16:11,663 --> 01:16:14,213
and 12 years ago you wanted
to win the Pulitzer.

756
01:16:15,133 --> 01:16:16,753
What do you want to win now?

757
01:16:20,303 --> 01:16:22,352
I haven't thought of things like that recently.

758
01:16:22,552 --> 01:16:23,562
Really?

759
01:16:23,762 --> 01:16:25,302
Then think about it for a moment.

760
01:16:26,392 --> 01:16:28,012
There must be an award you want.

761
01:16:35,111 --> 01:16:38,151
A Tony.

762
01:16:39,281 --> 01:16:41,320
You really are exactly
the same as I remember you.

763
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,610
Still psycho?

764
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,870
Still psycho.

765
01:17:33,955 --> 01:17:35,955
A little bit to your left.

766
01:17:36,915 --> 01:17:38,375
One, two... three!

767
01:17:39,205 --> 01:17:40,204
One more.

768
01:17:45,424 --> 01:17:47,044
Why are you taking it so close up?

769
01:17:47,924 --> 01:17:49,214
Fine. Go back a little bit.

770
01:18:09,521 --> 01:18:11,321
She's turned against us.

771
01:18:44,388 --> 01:18:45,478
Hold on.

772
01:18:50,357 --> 01:18:51,767
You look young.

773
01:18:53,227 --> 01:18:54,607
Because of my green card,

774
01:18:54,807 --> 01:18:57,107
we got married
a little earlier than planned.

775
01:19:04,736 --> 01:19:06,076
He knows I'm coming over?

776
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:07,496
Of course.

777
01:19:16,455 --> 01:19:17,795
He knows who I am?

778
01:19:18,544 --> 01:19:19,624
Of course!

779
01:19:20,794 --> 01:19:22,294
He wants to meet you.

780
01:19:49,571 --> 01:19:50,571
Come in.

781
01:20:18,601 --> 01:20:20,057
Um...

782
01:20:20,058 --> 01:20:21,388
Hello.

783
01:20:23,148 --> 01:20:25,268
Nice to meet you.

784
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:33,981
Uh, hi.
Nice to meet you, also.

785
01:20:35,407 --> 01:20:36,786
His Korean is good.

786
01:20:36,986 --> 01:20:38,116
No.

787
01:20:45,559 --> 01:20:46,492
Uh...
Are you hungry?

788
01:20:48,227 --> 01:20:50,095
Are you hungry?

789
01:20:50,229 --> 01:20:51,664
Hm?
Oh...

790
01:20:51,665 --> 01:20:52,925
Hungry?

791
01:20:53,767 --> 01:20:55,434
Ah, oh. Yes.

792
01:20:56,004 --> 01:20:57,844
What would you like to eat?

793
01:20:58,704 --> 01:21:00,071
Uh...

794
01:21:02,073 --> 01:21:03,307
Pasta?

795
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:06,076
Pasta? Yeah.
You like pasta?

796
01:21:06,209 --> 01:21:07,978
Yes.

797
01:21:08,111 --> 01:21:09,747
Okay.
Okay.

798
01:21:09,881 --> 01:21:11,481
Let's get pasta.
Pasta.

799
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:20,022
What did you two do today?

800
01:21:20,523 --> 01:21:21,524
Uh...

801
01:21:24,293 --> 01:21:26,361
The Statue of Liberty.

802
01:21:27,028 --> 01:21:28,496
You took the ferry.

803
01:21:28,631 --> 01:21:29,832
Yes.
Yeah.

804
01:21:29,964 --> 01:21:31,499
It's, um, nice.

805
01:21:31,901 --> 01:21:33,501
I've never been.

806
01:21:33,636 --> 01:21:34,603
What?
Really?

807
01:21:34,737 --> 01:21:37,037
Yeah, I've never
actually been there.

808
01:21:37,038 --> 01:21:39,630
Hey, you should take your husband.

809
01:21:42,644 --> 01:21:44,846
Have we seriously
never been there together?

810
01:21:44,977 --> 01:21:46,580
No.

811
01:21:58,323 --> 01:22:01,159
<i>When I was 24 year,</i>

812
01:22:01,727 --> 01:22:04,962
I, uh... Um...

813
01:22:06,565 --> 01:22:07,498
Oh.
Oh. Military service?

814
01:22:08,567 --> 01:22:10,100
Yes.

815
01:22:10,234 --> 01:22:12,269
Oh, military service.

816
01:22:12,403 --> 01:22:13,738
Right.

817
01:22:13,872 --> 01:22:15,706
You know how Korean men have
mandatory military service?

818
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,074
Yeah, your dad
talks about it.
How was it?

819
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:19,142
You like it?
How was it? Did you like it?

820
01:22:21,377 --> 01:22:24,246
No.

821
01:22:24,379 --> 01:22:29,451
Uh, but military
and work, same.

822
01:22:30,085 --> 01:22:31,053
Same?
Same? How?

823
01:22:33,055 --> 01:22:34,623
Uh, you have, um...

824
01:22:35,858 --> 01:22:37,626
You have a boss.

825
01:22:37,759 --> 01:22:38,927
Hm.
There's overtime pay, stuff like that here, right?

826
01:22:43,184 --> 01:22:44,733
In Korea, you work overtime all the time,

827
01:22:44,933 --> 01:22:46,443
but there's no overtime pay.

828
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,902
There's no
overtime pay in Korea.

829
01:22:49,903 --> 01:22:51,273
- Really?
- Mm.

830
01:22:51,823 --> 01:22:54,402
You have to do
all of your boss's work first,

831
01:22:55,072 --> 01:22:57,452
then you do your own work,

832
01:22:57,782 --> 01:23:00,162
and then you can go home.

833
01:23:01,122 --> 01:23:02,502
Late at night?

834
01:23:02,702 --> 01:23:04,041
That's so hard.

835
01:23:06,384 --> 01:23:09,254
It's, uh, very hard.

836
01:23:09,387 --> 01:23:13,691
Hmm. Uh, work. Work is hard.

837
01:23:13,825 --> 01:23:16,089
Hard physically or mentally?

838
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:18,840
Physically, or mentally?

839
01:23:19,396 --> 01:23:21,566
Uh, yes.
Uh, both.

840
01:23:21,699 --> 01:23:25,067
Physical, very hard.

841
01:23:25,201 --> 01:23:28,705
Uh, and, um...
Hm. Mentally.

842
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:32,208
Mentally, I'm strong.

843
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:34,309
Mm!

844
01:23:35,438 --> 01:23:37,368
You're strong mentally?

845
01:23:37,568 --> 01:23:39,028
Yes, right.

846
01:23:54,456 --> 01:23:55,796
It was good that you immigrated.

847
01:23:56,597 --> 01:23:57,598
Mm.
Mm. I agree.

848
01:23:58,996 --> 01:24:00,886
Korea is too small of a country for you.

849
01:24:01,926 --> 01:24:04,635
It's not enough to satisfy your ambition.

850
01:24:08,265 --> 01:24:10,185
I'm glad to have seen you.

851
01:24:11,515 --> 01:24:12,514
Yeah.

852
01:24:13,894 --> 01:24:16,894
And thank you for introducing me
to your husband.

853
01:24:17,814 --> 01:24:20,194
I can tell he really loves you.

854
01:24:23,153 --> 01:24:24,354
Hm.
Hmm.

855
01:24:26,613 --> 01:24:29,573
I didn't know that liking
your husband would hurt this much.

856
01:24:39,412 --> 01:24:40,462
Yeah?

857
01:24:43,237 --> 01:24:44,439
Hm.
Hmm.

858
01:24:47,841 --> 01:24:51,221
When we stopped talking,

859
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:53,720
I really missed you.

860
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:57,270
Did you miss me?

861
01:24:57,470 --> 01:24:58,430
Of course.

862
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:00,940
But you met your husband then.

863
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:02,809
You got a girlfriend then, too.

864
01:25:07,859 --> 01:25:08,899
Sorry.

865
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,368
It's okay.

866
01:25:16,118 --> 01:25:17,578
Seeing you again

867
01:25:18,998 --> 01:25:22,117
and being here makes me have
a lot of weird thoughts.

868
01:25:23,707 --> 01:25:24,787
What kind of thoughts?

869
01:25:26,787 --> 01:25:32,006
What if I'd come
to New York 12 years ago?

870
01:25:33,296 --> 01:25:35,676
What if you had never left Seoul?

871
01:25:37,176 --> 01:25:39,096
If you hadn't just left like that,

872
01:25:39,296 --> 01:25:40,805
and we just grew up together,

873
01:25:42,845 --> 01:25:44,475
would I still have looked for you?

874
01:25:45,725 --> 01:25:49,775
Would we have dated? Broken up?

875
01:25:50,185 --> 01:25:51,564
Gotten married?

876
01:25:54,314 --> 01:25:56,114
Would we have had kids together?

877
01:25:56,314 --> 01:25:57,614
Thoughts like that.

878
01:26:05,323 --> 01:26:08,533
But the truth I learned here is,

879
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:13,502
you had to leave because you're you.

880
01:26:15,292 --> 01:26:18,542
And the reason I liked you
is because you're you.

881
01:26:21,631 --> 01:26:26,051
And who you are is someone who leaves.

882
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:31,810
The Na Young you remember

883
01:26:32,010 --> 01:26:33,730
doesn't exist here.

884
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:36,190
I know.

885
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:41,569
But...

886
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:44,199
that little girl did exist.

887
01:26:46,569 --> 01:26:49,198
She's not sitting here in front of you,

888
01:26:49,408 --> 01:26:51,408
but it doesn't mean she's not real.

889
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:55,288
20 years ago,

890
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:59,497
I left her behind with you.

891
01:27:02,587 --> 01:27:03,587
I know.

892
01:27:05,717 --> 01:27:07,307
And even though I was only 12,

893
01:27:07,507 --> 01:27:09,546
I loved her.

894
01:27:15,806 --> 01:27:17,306
You psycho.

895
01:27:25,275 --> 01:27:30,064
I think there was something
in our past lives.

896
01:27:32,534 --> 01:27:35,324
Otherwise, why would we be here
together right now?

897
01:27:36,574 --> 01:27:39,793
But in this life,

898
01:27:39,993 --> 01:27:41,793
we don't have the In-Yun to be

899
01:27:41,993 --> 01:27:43,703
that kind of person to each other.

900
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:46,663
Because now, finally,

901
01:27:47,753 --> 01:27:49,332
we're in the same city

902
01:27:50,382 --> 01:27:53,052
for the first time in 20 years...

903
01:27:58,221 --> 01:28:00,641
We're sitting here with your husband.

904
01:28:07,810 --> 01:28:11,270
In this life, you and Arthur
are that kind of In-Yun to each other.

905
01:28:12,610 --> 01:28:14,940
You two have the 8,000 layers of In-Yun.

906
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:18,569
To Arthur,

907
01:28:19,569 --> 01:28:21,779
you're someone who stays.

908
01:28:26,673 --> 01:28:28,574
He's talking about you.

909
01:28:34,088 --> 01:28:36,428
Who do you think we were to each other
in our past lives?

910
01:28:36,628 --> 01:28:37,717
I don't know.

911
01:28:39,087 --> 01:28:41,217
Maybe... an impossible affair?

912
01:28:41,417 --> 01:28:43,427
Between the queen
and the king's henchman?

913
01:28:44,967 --> 01:28:47,976
Or maybe we were forced
to live together

914
01:28:48,176 --> 01:28:49,856
in a political marriage,

915
01:28:50,056 --> 01:28:51,856
and we were awful to each other.

916
01:28:52,056 --> 01:28:53,276
Cheat on each other a bunch.

917
01:28:53,476 --> 01:28:54,976
Say hurtful things to each other.

918
01:28:56,855 --> 01:28:59,655
Or maybe we were just sitting
next to each other on the same train.

919
01:28:59,855 --> 01:29:00,985
Why?

920
01:29:01,185 --> 01:29:03,155
Just because that's what our tickets said.

921
01:29:05,655 --> 01:29:06,654
Maybe,

922
01:29:07,404 --> 01:29:10,784
we were just a bird

923
01:29:10,984 --> 01:29:14,084
and the branch it sat on one morning.

924
01:29:58,487 --> 01:30:00,857
I'm sorry
we speak alone.

925
01:30:01,691 --> 01:30:04,027
Uh, we will stop.

926
01:30:12,101 --> 01:30:13,669
It's okay.

927
01:30:13,802 --> 01:30:15,870
You haven't seen each other
in a long time.

928
01:30:24,379 --> 01:30:27,547
I never thought I'd be
a part of something like this.

929
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:30,050
Hm?

930
01:30:30,751 --> 01:30:32,119
Sitting here with you.

931
01:30:37,657 --> 01:30:40,126
Do you know what <i>in-yun?</i>

932
01:30:40,259 --> 01:30:44,030
Yeah. Nora told me about it
when we first met.

933
01:30:47,666 --> 01:30:48,900
You and me.

934
01:30:50,035 --> 01:30:53,705
Yeah. Yeah,
you and I are <i>in-yun</i> too.

935
01:30:53,838 --> 01:30:55,806
Right?

936
01:31:04,014 --> 01:31:05,648
I'm really glad
you came here.

937
01:31:07,817 --> 01:31:09,752
It was
the right thing
to do.

938
01:31:33,307 --> 01:31:35,742
Mm. I'm gonna
walk him to his Uber.

939
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,777
Okay.

940
01:31:40,413 --> 01:31:42,882
Uh, nice to meet you.

941
01:31:43,916 --> 01:31:45,317
Nice to meet you, too.

942
01:31:45,985 --> 01:31:48,520
Uh, come visit me in Korea.

943
01:31:49,588 --> 01:31:50,823
Definitely.

944
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:00,064
I'll be right back.

945
01:32:00,198 --> 01:32:01,232
Okay.

946
01:33:28,178 --> 01:33:29,478
Will it be here soon?

947
01:33:30,513 --> 01:33:31,516
Hm.

948
01:33:31,517 --> 01:33:32,727
Two minutes.

949
01:35:07,308 --> 01:35:08,318
Hey!

950
01:35:15,237 --> 01:35:16,407
Na Young.

951
01:35:18,477 --> 01:35:19,676
Hm?
Hmm?

952
01:35:29,915 --> 01:35:31,955
What if this is a past life as well,

953
01:35:33,505 --> 01:35:35,465
and we are already

954
01:35:36,045 --> 01:35:39,094
something else to each other
in our next life?

955
01:35:45,634 --> 01:35:47,394
Who do you think we are then?

956
01:35:49,893 --> 01:35:51,473
I don't know.

957
01:35:57,273 --> 01:35:58,273
Me neither.

958
01:36:07,782 --> 01:36:09,281
See you then.

959
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:19,305
