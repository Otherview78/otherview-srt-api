1
00:04:19,077 --> 00:04:22,164
Who's that stumbling around in the dark?

2
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,168
State your business or prepare to get winged.

3
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:31,089
Calm yourselves, gentlemen. I mean you no harm.

4
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:34,301
I'm simply a fellow weary traveller.

5
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:36,511
Whoa, boy.

6
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:41,641
Good cold evening, gentlemen. I'm looking for a pair of slave traders...

7
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:44,144
...that go by the name of the Speck Brothers.

8
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:45,645
Might that be you?

9
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:49,983
- Who wants to know? - Well, I do.

10
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,862
I'm Dr. King Schultz. This is my horse, Fritz.

11
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:56,824
- What kind of doctor? - Dentist.

12
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,701
Now, are you the Speck Brothers?

13
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:01,704
Did you purchase those men at the Greenville auction?

14
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:04,499
- So what? - So I wish to parley with you.

15
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:05,666
Speak English.

16
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,960
I'm sorry.

17
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:10,338
Please forgive me. It is a second language.

18
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:13,883
Now, amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe...

19
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,344
...is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

20
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:17,970
Hello, you poor devils.

21
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:22,141
Is there one amongst you who was formerly a resident...

22
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:25,311
...of the Carrucan plantation?

23
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,356
I'm from the Carrucan plantation.

24
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:31,566
Who said that?

25
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:39,567
Subtitle www.movieddl.me

26
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,284
What's your name?

27
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:26,039
Django.

28
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,876
Then you are exactly the one I'm looking for.

29
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:33,046
Do you know who the Brittle Brothers are?

30
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,593
Who are they?

31
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:41,763
Big John.

32
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,891
Ellis.

33
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,393
Roger.

34
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,354
Sometime they call him Little Raj.

35
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:52,733
They was overseers at the Carrucan plantation.

36
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,984
Not anymore.

37
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,367
Tell me, if you were to see any of these three gentlemen again...

38
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:03,828
- ...would you recognise them? - Hey.

39
00:07:04,537 --> 00:07:07,040
- Stop talking to him like that. - Like what?

40
00:07:07,457 --> 00:07:08,499
Like that.

41
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,169
My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain...

42
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:13,212
Speak English, goddamn it.

43
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,381
Everybody calm down.

44
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:19,218
I'm simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction.

45
00:07:19,385 --> 00:07:22,347
I don't care. No sale. Now, off with you.

46
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:25,433
Don't be ridiculous. Of course they're for sale.

47
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:27,769
Move it.

48
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:32,732
My good man, did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture...

49
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:36,736
...or are you pointing your weapon at me with lethal intention?

50
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:39,739
Last chance, fancy pants.

51
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,409
Oh, very well.

52
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:16,610
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast. I didn't want you to do anything rash...

53
00:08:16,777 --> 00:08:19,363
...before you had a moment to come to your senses.

54
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,908
You goddamn son of a bitch.

55
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:24,535
You shot Roscoe!

56
00:08:24,702 --> 00:08:25,786
Well...

57
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:27,413
And you killed Ace!

58
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,624
I only shot your brother once he threatened to shoot me.

59
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,251
And I do believe I have...

60
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:33,669
One, two, three, four.

61
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:36,755
- -Five witnesses who can attest to that fact.

62
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:39,425
- Damn leg's busted. - No doubt.

63
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:42,761
Now, if you could keep your caterwauling down to a minimum...

64
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:46,432
...I'd like to finish my line of enquiry with young Django.

65
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:51,729
God-fucking-damn it!

66
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:53,397
As I was saying...

67
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:57,776
...if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again, you could recognise them?

68
00:08:57,943 --> 00:08:59,319
Yeah.

69
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:01,030
Sold American!

70
00:09:01,196 --> 00:09:02,322
So, Mr. Speck?

71
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:05,200
Mr. Speck? How much for young Django here?

72
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:13,251
That iron is nasty business.

73
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:20,925
Oh, could you hold this for a moment?

74
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:23,595
Thank you.

75
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:26,306
Django? Get up on that horse.

76
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:28,058
Also, if I were you...

77
00:09:28,224 --> 00:09:32,604
...I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind.

78
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:50,497
Nigger! Don't you touch my brother's coat.

79
00:10:01,674 --> 00:10:04,010
Goddamn it!

80
00:10:08,014 --> 00:10:10,725
One hundred, 10...

81
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:12,727
...20...

82
00:10:13,103 --> 00:10:14,730
...and 5...

83
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,274
...for young Django here.

84
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:19,652
And since he won't be needing it anymore...

85
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,154
...I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

86
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:25,032
Also, Mr. Speck...

87
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:29,120
...I'm afraid I will require a bill of sale. Do you have one?

88
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:32,790
You go to hell, dentist.

89
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:34,917
I thought not.

90
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:38,796
No worries. I come prepared.

91
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,426
Thank you.

92
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:48,389
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.

93
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:09,243
Now, as to you poor devils...

94
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,370
So, as I see it...

95
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,456
...when it comes to the subject of what to do next...

96
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:17,459
...you gentlemen have two choices.

97
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:18,752
One:

98
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:22,716
Once I'm gone, you could lift that beast off the remaining Speck...

99
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,885
...then carry him to the nearest town.

100
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:28,638
Which would be at least 37 miles back the way you came.

101
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:30,056
Or two:

102
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:32,976
You could unshackle yourselves...

103
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:34,436
...take that rifle...

104
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:37,606
...put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep...

105
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:41,484
...and then make your way to a more enlightened area of this country.

106
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,069
Choice is yours.

107
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:47,574
Oh, and on the off chance there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you...

108
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,827
...the North Star is that one.

109
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:53,788
Ta-ta.

110
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:13,934
Now, wait a minute, fellas. Let's talk about this.

111
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:21,691
You gotta be reasonable in a situation like this.

112
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:25,821
I'm not a bad guy. I'm just doing my job.

113
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:29,533
Blueberry, didn't I give you my last apple?

114
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,952
Tell you what, boys:

115
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:34,872
Take me to the doc in El Paso, I'll get you your freedom.

116
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,207
No. No, please.

117
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:25,464
All right, now.

118
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:28,134
I'd like you to take two of these tonight...

119
00:13:28,302 --> 00:13:30,262
...and then in the morning...

120
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:33,974
That's a nigger on a horse.

121
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:01,335
What's everybody staring at?

122
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:04,463
They ain't never seen no nigger on a horse before.

123
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:29,571
Good morning, innkeeper.

124
00:14:30,822 --> 00:14:33,242
Two beers for two weary travellers.

125
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:37,705
It's still a bit early. We won't be open for another hour.

126
00:14:37,872 --> 00:14:39,791
By then, we'll be serving breakfast.

127
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:45,254
What the hell you think you're doing, boy?

128
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:47,715
Get that nigger out of here.

129
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,013
Help! Help!

130
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,223
Innkeeper!

131
00:14:55,681 --> 00:14:58,601
Remember, get the sheriff, not the marshal.

132
00:14:58,768 --> 00:15:00,853
Sheriff! Help!

133
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,730
Alas...

134
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:06,776
...now we must act as our own bartender.

135
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:10,613
Sit down, my boy.

136
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:22,208
What kind of dentist are you?

137
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,840
Despite that cart, I haven't practised dentistry in five years.

138
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:36,097
But these days, I practise a new profession:

139
00:15:38,642 --> 00:15:39,893
Bounty hunter.

140
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,819
Do you know what a bounty hunter is?

141
00:15:48,986 --> 00:15:50,154
No.

142
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,488
Well...

143
00:15:52,948 --> 00:15:57,077
...the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash...

144
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:59,913
...a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

145
00:16:00,998 --> 00:16:02,332
Hat.

146
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:18,223
The state places a bounty on a man's head.

147
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,059
I track that man, I find that man, I kill that man.

148
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:25,272
After I've killed him, I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities.

149
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:28,150
Sometimes that's easier said than done.

150
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:32,946
I show that corpse to the authorities, proving indeed, I truly have killed him.

151
00:16:33,113 --> 00:16:35,866
At which point the authorities pay me the bounty.

152
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:39,536
So, like slavery, it's a flesh-for-cash business.

153
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:42,165
What's a bounty?

154
00:16:46,044 --> 00:16:47,545
It's like a reward.

155
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:51,090
You kill people? And they give you a reward?

156
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,134
Certain people, yeah.

157
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:55,094
Bad people?

158
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:58,264
Badder they are, bigger the reward.

159
00:16:58,723 --> 00:17:00,767
Which brings me to you.

160
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,938
And I must admit, I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you.

161
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:07,941
On one hand, I despise slavery.

162
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:11,319
On the other hand, I need your help.

163
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:14,781
If you're not in a position to refuse, all the better.

164
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:16,824
So for the time being...

165
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:20,370
...I'm gonna make this slavery malarkey work to my benefit.

166
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,581
Still, having said that...

167
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:25,500
...I feel guilty.

168
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:32,507
So I would like the two of us to enter into an agreement.

169
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:41,349
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

170
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:49,441
However, at this endeavour, I'm at a slight disadvantage...

171
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:52,820
...insofar as I don't know what they look like.

172
00:17:54,113 --> 00:17:56,865
But you do. Don't you?

173
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:59,243
I know what they look like, all right.

174
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,536
Good.

175
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:02,871
So here's my agreement.

176
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:05,124
You travel with me until we find them.

177
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,500
Where we going?

178
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:09,336
I hear at least two of them are overseeing in Gatlinburg...

179
00:18:09,503 --> 00:18:11,255
...but I don't know where.

180
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:16,176
That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find them.

181
00:18:16,343 --> 00:18:17,970
And when we find them...

182
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,556
...you point them out and I kill them.

183
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:24,018
You do that...

184
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:28,564
...I agree to give you your freedom, $25 per Brittle Brother.

185
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:30,107
That's $75.

186
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:34,653
And, as if on cue, here comes the sheriff.

187
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:45,164
Okay, boys. Fun's over.

188
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:47,750
Come on out.

189
00:18:50,711 --> 00:18:54,841
All right, folks, calm down.

190
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,594
Go about your business.

191
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:00,513
These jokers will be gone soon.

192
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:07,646
Now, why y'all wanna come into my town and start trouble?

193
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:11,191
And scare all these nice people.

194
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,195
You ain't got nothing better to do...

195
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,490
...than to come into Bill Sharp's town...

196
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,743
...and show your ass?

197
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:31,795
What'd you just do to our sheriff?

198
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,810
Now you can get the marshal.

199
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,480
Marshal! Marshal!

200
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,982
- Should we wait inside? - Can we just leave?

201
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:54,484
After you.

202
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:00,700
Move that buckboard a long ways across the street from the saloon.

203
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:04,036
I want six men, six rifles behind it.

204
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,455
I want two men, two rifles up on this roof.

205
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,749
Two men, two rifles on that roof.

206
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,794
All the barrels aimed at that front door.

207
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,256
Somebody get poor Bill out of the goddamn street.

208
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,175
You in the saloon.

209
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:22,304
We got 100 rifles aimed at every way out of that building.

210
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,058
You got one chance to get out of this alive.

211
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:31,439
You and your nigger come out right now, and I mean right now.

212
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:36,068
Is this the marshal I have the pleasure of addressing?

213
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:37,987
Yes, it is.

214
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,281
This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

215
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,616
Na wunderbar, marshal.

216
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,829
I have relieved myself of all weapons...

217
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,957
...and just as you have instructed...

218
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,793
...I am ready to step outside...

219
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,881
...with my hands raised above my head.

220
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,426
I trust, as a representative...

221
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:04,139
...of the criminal justice system of the United States of America...

222
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:07,309
...I shan't be shot down in the street...

223
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:10,145
...by either you or your deputies...

224
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:13,064
...before I've had my day in court.

225
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,317
You mean like you did our sheriff?

226
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,527
Shot him down like a dog in the street.

227
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,946
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

228
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,199
Do I have your word as a lawman...

229
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:26,161
...not to shoot me down like a dog in the street?

230
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,667
Well, much as we'd all enjoy seeing something like that...

231
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,796
...ain't nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town.

232
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,633
Fair enough, marshal. Here we come.

233
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,553
They're a little tense out there...

234
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,432
...so don't make any quick movements and let me do the talking.

235
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,268
Come ahead.

236
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,320
- You unarmed? - Yes, indeed we are.

237
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,282
Marshal Tatum, may I address you and your deputies...

238
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,994
...and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey...

239
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:09,789
...as to the incident that just occurred?

240
00:22:10,498 --> 00:22:11,749
Go on.

241
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,125
Thank you.

242
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:15,294
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

243
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:18,840
Like yourself, marshal, I'm a servant of the court.

244
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:20,800
The man lying dead in the dirt...

245
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:24,762
...who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff...

246
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:27,056
...who went by the name of Bill Sharp...

247
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:31,269
...is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck...

248
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:34,021
...with a price on his head of $200.

249
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:37,191
Now that's $200, dead or alive.

250
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:38,651
The hell, you say.

251
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:42,738
I'm aware this is probably disconcerting news.

252
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:44,365
But I'm willing to wager...

253
00:22:44,532 --> 00:22:48,786
...this man was elected sheriff sometime in the past two years?

254
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:52,957
- Yeah. - I know this because three years ago...

255
00:22:53,124 --> 00:22:56,586
...he was rustling cattle from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company...

256
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:58,004
...of Lubbock, Texas.

257
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,882
Now, this is a warrant...

258
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:05,636
...made out by circuit court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk...

259
00:23:05,803 --> 00:23:07,763
...of Austin, Texas.

260
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,682
You're encouraged to wire him.

261
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,685
He'll back up who I am...

262
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:15,022
...and who your dear departed sheriff was.

263
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:24,907
In other words, marshal...

264
00:23:25,073 --> 00:23:27,367
...you owe me $200.

265
00:23:35,751 --> 00:23:37,085
I'll be damned.

266
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,241
After this Brittle business is behind us...

267
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:10,786
...you'll be a free man...

268
00:24:10,953 --> 00:24:14,958
...with a horse, $75 in your back pocket.

269
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:18,586
What's your plan after that?

270
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:22,674
Find my wife...

271
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:24,884
...and buy her freedom.

272
00:24:27,011 --> 00:24:28,721
Django...

273
00:24:29,347 --> 00:24:32,058
...I had no idea you were a married man.

274
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:35,353
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

275
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:37,897
Me and my wife do.

276
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:43,111
Old Man Carrucan didn't. That's why we run off.

277
00:24:44,153 --> 00:24:45,905
Django.

278
00:24:46,197 --> 00:24:48,783
Django, Django.

279
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:51,577
You got sand, Django.

280
00:24:52,453 --> 00:24:54,706
The boy's got sand.

281
00:24:56,124 --> 00:24:59,168
I got no use for a nigger with sand.

282
00:25:00,837 --> 00:25:04,507
I want you to burn a runaway "R" right here on his cheek.

283
00:25:04,674 --> 00:25:05,717
And the girl too.

284
00:25:07,635 --> 00:25:10,930
And I want you to take them to the Greenville auction...

285
00:25:11,097 --> 00:25:12,974
...and sell them.

286
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:15,059
Both of them.

287
00:25:15,393 --> 00:25:17,478
Separately.

288
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:21,316
And this one...

289
00:25:23,402 --> 00:25:26,613
...you will sell him cheap.

290
00:25:28,282 --> 00:25:29,992
In Greenville...

291
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:35,873
...there should be some sort of a records office.

292
00:25:42,504 --> 00:25:45,090
You know when she was sold...

293
00:25:46,216 --> 00:25:48,761
...you know where she came from...

294
00:25:49,303 --> 00:25:51,138
...and you know her name.

295
00:25:51,972 --> 00:25:53,515
What is her name?

296
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:55,642
Broomhilda.

297
00:25:56,894 --> 00:25:57,936
What?

298
00:25:58,103 --> 00:26:00,189
Broomhilda.

299
00:26:00,397 --> 00:26:02,191
Broomhilda?

300
00:26:04,485 --> 00:26:06,153
Were her owners German?

301
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,738
Yeah, how you know?

302
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:11,283
She wasn't born on the plantation. She was raised by a German.

303
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,618
The Von Shafts.

304
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:14,661
She speak a little German too.

305
00:26:14,953 --> 00:26:16,955
- Your wife? - When she was little...

306
00:26:17,122 --> 00:26:20,834
...her mistress taught her so she'd have someone to speak German with.

307
00:26:21,877 --> 00:26:24,005
Well, let me get this straight.

308
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:29,135
Your slave wife speaks German and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

309
00:26:29,302 --> 00:26:30,678
Yep.

310
00:26:34,682 --> 00:26:36,726
They call me Hildi.

311
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:57,330
When we gain access to these plantations...

312
00:26:57,497 --> 00:27:00,125
...we'll be putting on an act.

313
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,962
You'll be playing a character.

314
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:14,013
No?

315
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:25,692
Now, during the act, you can never break character.

316
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:27,944
Do you understand?

317
00:27:28,737 --> 00:27:31,657
Yeah. Don't break character.

318
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:37,872
And your character is that of the Valet.

319
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:39,707
What that is?

320
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:43,085
That's a fancy word for servant.

321
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,795
Valet?

322
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:50,676
And now, Django, you may choose your character's costume.

323
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:54,847
Youse gonna let me pick out my own clothes?

324
00:27:55,014 --> 00:27:56,640
But of course.

325
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:33,803
It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory.

326
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,307
This is my valet. My valet does not walk.

327
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:39,601
I said niggers on horses...

328
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:42,562
His name is Django. He's a free man.

329
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:44,356
He can ride what he pleases.

330
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,859
Not on my property. Not around my niggers, he can't.

331
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:50,737
My good sir...

332
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,573
...perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

333
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,284
Allow me to unring this bell.

334
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:59,996
My name is Dr. King Schultz. This is my valet, Django.

335
00:29:00,163 --> 00:29:03,124
And these are our horses, Tony and Fritz.

336
00:29:06,294 --> 00:29:07,671
Mr. Bennett?

337
00:29:07,837 --> 00:29:12,467
I've been led to believe that you are a gentleman and a businessman.

338
00:29:12,634 --> 00:29:16,304
And it is for these attributes we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee...

339
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:18,265
...to parley with you now.

340
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:22,602
I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals.

341
00:29:24,938 --> 00:29:28,191
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee...

342
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:30,151
...to buy one of my nigger gals?

343
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:31,945
No appointment, no nothing?

344
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,030
Oh, I'm afraid so.

345
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:36,700
Well, what if I was to say I don't like you...

346
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:38,452
...or your fancy-pants nigger?

347
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:40,830
And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.

348
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:43,708
Now, what you got to say about that?

349
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:48,170
Mr. Bennett...

350
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:51,882
...if you are the businessman I've been led to believe you to be...

351
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:56,971
...I have 5000 things I might say that could change your mind.

352
00:30:01,183 --> 00:30:04,562
Well, come on inside and get yourself something cool to drink.

353
00:30:18,826 --> 00:30:20,619
Maybe while we discuss business...

354
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:23,831
...you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures...

355
00:30:23,998 --> 00:30:26,709
...to escort Django around your magnificent grounds.

356
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:28,044
Oh, well, absolutely.

357
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,629
- Betina. - Yes, sir, Big Daddy?

358
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:32,590
What your Jimmie's name again?

359
00:30:32,757 --> 00:30:34,216
- Django. - Django.

360
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:36,719
Betina, sugar, could you take Django there...

361
00:30:36,886 --> 00:30:40,056
...and take him around and show him all the pretty stuff?

362
00:30:40,222 --> 00:30:42,976
- As you please, Big Daddy. - Oh, Mr. Bennett...

363
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:45,520
...I must remind you, Django is a free man.

364
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:47,606
He cannot be treated like a slave.

365
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:51,860
In the bounds of good taste, he must be treated as an extension of myself.

366
00:30:52,027 --> 00:30:54,321
- Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar? - Yes'm?

367
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:59,659
Django isn't a slave. Django is a free man, you understand?

368
00:31:00,952 --> 00:31:03,288
You can't treat him like the other niggers...

369
00:31:03,455 --> 00:31:06,333
...because he ain't like the other niggers. You got it?

370
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,378
You want I should treat him like white folks?

371
00:31:09,544 --> 00:31:10,837
No.

372
00:31:11,296 --> 00:31:12,672
That's not what I said.

373
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:15,300
Then I don't know what you want, Big Daddy.

374
00:31:15,675 --> 00:31:18,595
Yes, I can see that.

375
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:24,935
What's the name of that peckerwood boy from town that works with the glass?

376
00:31:25,102 --> 00:31:27,145
His mama work over at the lumberyard.

377
00:31:27,312 --> 00:31:30,023
- Oh, you mean Jerry. - That's the boy's name. Jerry.

378
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,943
- You know Jerry, don't you, sugar? - Yes'm, Big Daddy.

379
00:31:33,402 --> 00:31:38,115
Well, that's it, then. You just treat him like you would Jerry.

380
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:47,792
That house we just left from is the Big House.

381
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:51,170
Big Daddy call it that because it's big.

382
00:31:51,963 --> 00:31:54,215
That there is the pantry.

383
00:31:54,382 --> 00:31:57,677
That's where Big Daddy hang all his dead meat.

384
00:31:57,969 --> 00:32:00,304
Poor little squirrels.

385
00:32:01,722 --> 00:32:04,016
What you do for your master?

386
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,352
Didn't you hear him? I ain't no slave.

387
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:08,813
- So you really free? - Yes, I's free.

388
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,482
You mean you wanna dress like that?

389
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:15,903
- Betina, I need to ask you something. - What you want?

390
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,157
I'm looking for three white men. Three brothers. Overseers.

391
00:32:19,323 --> 00:32:21,951
- Their name is Brittle. You know them? - Brittle?

392
00:32:22,118 --> 00:32:26,956
Yes, Brittle. John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, Roger Brittle, sometime called Little Raj.

393
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,125
I don't know them.

394
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:31,377
They could be using a different name.

395
00:32:31,544 --> 00:32:35,047
- They would have come this past year. - You mean the Shaffers?

396
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,134
Maybe. Three brothers?

397
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:40,219
They here?

398
00:32:40,845 --> 00:32:42,889
Could you point one of them out to me?

399
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:45,099
Well, one's over in that field.

400
00:32:58,572 --> 00:33:00,908
Old Man Carrucan ain't gonna appreciate this.

401
00:33:01,074 --> 00:33:03,911
She work in the house, John. You mess her up...

402
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:06,205
...she ain't gonna be worth a damn thing.

403
00:33:06,371 --> 00:33:08,123
Now, your Bible say...

404
00:33:12,586 --> 00:33:14,963
I told you that I was one that made her do it.

405
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,966
- You ready? - She didn't wanna run off with me.

406
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:20,969
If anybody should be getting whupped, it should be me.

407
00:33:21,136 --> 00:33:23,889
I been here long enough, you know me a long time now.

408
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:37,444
You know Master Carrucan ain't gonna appreciate this. She's a house slave.

409
00:34:00,593 --> 00:34:03,137
I'm asking you, please. Ain't this what you want?

410
00:34:03,304 --> 00:34:05,807
I'm keeping it funny for you. Now, John, please.

411
00:34:10,728 --> 00:34:11,980
I's on my knees, John.

412
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,774
I like the way you beg, boy.

413
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:20,405
Is that who you was looking for?

414
00:34:22,198 --> 00:34:23,449
Yep.

415
00:34:24,534 --> 00:34:25,952
Where the other two at?

416
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:29,998
They by the stable, punishing Little Jody for breaking eggs.

417
00:34:30,164 --> 00:34:31,874
They whipping Little Jody?

418
00:34:32,292 --> 00:34:34,252
Point me in that direction.

419
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:37,880
You go to that tree and keep going thattaway.

420
00:34:42,635 --> 00:34:45,013
Go get that white man I came here with.

421
00:34:46,055 --> 00:34:47,640
- Come on, now. - No, no, please!

422
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:50,268
Come on, girlie. Come on.

423
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:51,978
Get you set up now.

424
00:34:52,145 --> 00:34:55,231
And the Lord said, "The fear of ye...

425
00:34:55,732 --> 00:35:00,988
...and the dread of ye shall be on every beast of the earth.'"

426
00:35:01,488 --> 00:35:02,865
Hey, give me that arm!

427
00:35:03,032 --> 00:35:06,452
You better give me that arm. You better give me that arm.

428
00:35:23,177 --> 00:35:25,179
Okay, she ready!

429
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:43,489
And after this, we'll see if you break eggs again.

430
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:48,118
John Brittle!

431
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:10,809
You remember me?

432
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:25,198
I like the way you die, boy.

433
00:36:30,662 --> 00:36:32,455
Goddamn son of a bitch.

434
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:52,892
Keep it funny!

435
00:37:18,335 --> 00:37:20,337
Y'all wanna see something?

436
00:37:23,382 --> 00:37:24,925
No!

437
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,687
Who were they?

438
00:37:37,438 --> 00:37:38,689
That's Big John.

439
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,399
That's Little Raj.

440
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:41,901
Where's Ellis?

441
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:45,446
He's the one hightailing it across that field right now.

442
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:50,868
- You sure that's him? - Yeah.

443
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,369
- Positive? - I don't know.

444
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:55,456
- If you're positive? - I don't know what "positive" mean.

445
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:57,041
- It means you're sure. - Yes.

446
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:00,169
- "Yes," what? - Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

447
00:38:12,348 --> 00:38:14,434
I'm positive he dead.

448
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:20,106
Django!

449
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:26,822
Everybody calm down. We mean no one else any harm.

450
00:38:26,988 --> 00:38:28,532
Who are you two jokers?

451
00:38:28,824 --> 00:38:31,701
I am Dr. King Schultz, a legal representative...

452
00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:34,538
...of the criminal justice system of the United States.

453
00:38:34,704 --> 00:38:39,084
The man to my left is Django Freeman. He's my deputy.

454
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:41,378
In my pocket is a warrant...

455
00:38:41,545 --> 00:38:45,924
...signed by circuit court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas...

456
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:49,719
...for the arrest and capture, dead or alive...

457
00:38:49,886 --> 00:38:54,641
...of John Brittle, Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.

458
00:38:54,808 --> 00:38:57,018
They were going by the name Shaffer.

459
00:38:58,353 --> 00:39:02,691
You know them by the name of Shaffer, but the butchers' real name was Brittle.

460
00:39:02,858 --> 00:39:06,152
These are wanted men. The law wants them for murder.

461
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:07,737
Now, I reiterate:

462
00:39:07,904 --> 00:39:10,574
The warrant states "dead or alive"...

463
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,077
...so when Mr. Freeman and myself executed these men on sight...

464
00:39:14,244 --> 00:39:17,414
...we were operating within our legal boundaries.

465
00:39:18,498 --> 00:39:22,712
I realise passions are high...

466
00:39:23,296 --> 00:39:24,922
...but I must warn you:

467
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:28,759
The penalty for taking deadly force against an officer of the court...

468
00:39:28,926 --> 00:39:31,053
...in the performance of his duty is...

469
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:34,098
...you'll be hung by the neck until you're dead.

470
00:39:36,893 --> 00:39:41,856
Now, may I please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it?

471
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:44,859
Gimme.

472
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,169
Satisfied?

473
00:40:09,342 --> 00:40:11,636
May I have that back, please?

474
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:18,434
Get off my land.

475
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:20,394
Posthaste.

476
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:25,567
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can and let's get out of here.

477
00:40:51,134 --> 00:40:54,638
Yeah, that's them sons of bitches.

478
00:41:34,804 --> 00:41:35,930
Come on, men!

479
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,435
We're coming for you, nigger!

480
00:41:50,903 --> 00:41:53,489
Now, unless they start shooting first...

481
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:55,283
...nobody shoot them.

482
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:57,618
That's way too simple for these jokers.

483
00:41:58,411 --> 00:42:01,289
We're gonna whup that nigger lover to death.

484
00:42:01,456 --> 00:42:05,918
And I'm gonna personally strip and clip that garboon myself.

485
00:42:10,214 --> 00:42:11,632
Damn.

486
00:42:12,717 --> 00:42:15,470
I can't see fucking shit out of this thing.

487
00:42:16,054 --> 00:42:17,972
We ready or what?

488
00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:20,141
Hold on, I'm fucking with my eye holes.

489
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:24,896
Oh, shit. I just made it worse.

490
00:42:25,063 --> 00:42:28,149
- Who made this goddamn shit? - Willard's wife.

491
00:42:28,316 --> 00:42:30,276
Well, make your own goddamn masks.

492
00:42:30,443 --> 00:42:34,156
Look, nobody's saying they don't appreciate what Jenny did.

493
00:42:34,323 --> 00:42:38,744
If all I had to do was cut a hole in a bag, I could have cut it better than this.

494
00:42:38,911 --> 00:42:41,580
What about you, Robert? Can you see?

495
00:42:41,747 --> 00:42:43,082
Not too good.

496
00:42:43,248 --> 00:42:47,586
I mean, if I don't move my head I can see you pretty good, more or less.

497
00:42:47,753 --> 00:42:51,256
When I start riding, the bag's moving all over and I'm riding blind.

498
00:42:51,423 --> 00:42:52,758
Shit.

499
00:42:53,926 --> 00:42:55,594
I just made mine worse.

500
00:42:57,846 --> 00:42:59,389
Anybody bring any extra bags?

501
00:42:59,556 --> 00:43:02,518
No, nobody brought an extra bag.

502
00:43:02,684 --> 00:43:06,271
- I'm just asking. - Do we have to wear them when we ride?

503
00:43:06,438 --> 00:43:09,441
Well, shit fire. If you don't wear them as you ride up...

504
00:43:09,608 --> 00:43:12,986
- ...that defeats the purpose. - I can't see in this fucking thing!

505
00:43:13,153 --> 00:43:15,906
I can't breathe and I can't ride in this thing.

506
00:43:16,073 --> 00:43:18,367
Well, fuck all y'all. I'm going home.

507
00:43:18,534 --> 00:43:20,619
Now, I watched my wife work all day...

508
00:43:20,786 --> 00:43:24,665
...getting 30 bags together for you ungrateful sons of bitches...

509
00:43:24,832 --> 00:43:28,585
...and all I can hear is criticise, criticise, criticise.

510
00:43:28,752 --> 00:43:32,297
From now on, don't ask me or mine for nothing.

511
00:43:32,965 --> 00:43:36,176
Now, look. Let's not forget why we're here.

512
00:43:36,343 --> 00:43:40,932
We got a killer nigger over that hill, and we gotta make a lesson out of him.

513
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:44,894
Okay, I'm confused. Are the bags on or off?

514
00:43:45,103 --> 00:43:49,816
I think we all think the bag was a nice idea.

515
00:43:49,983 --> 00:43:51,025
Yeah.

516
00:43:51,192 --> 00:43:55,029
But, not pointing any fingers, they could have been done better.

517
00:43:56,281 --> 00:43:59,909
So how about no bags this time...

518
00:44:00,076 --> 00:44:04,831
...but next time we do the bags right and then we go full regalia.

519
00:44:04,998 --> 00:44:07,041
- I like that idea. - You get my vote.

520
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:08,251
Wait a minute.

521
00:44:08,835 --> 00:44:10,670
I didn't say no bags.

522
00:44:10,837 --> 00:44:12,839
But nobody can see.

523
00:44:13,256 --> 00:44:16,134
- So? - So it'd be nice to see.

524
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:21,055
Goddamn it! This is a raid! I can't see, you can't see.

525
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:26,561
So what? All that matters is can the fucking horse see. That's a raid!

526
00:44:28,062 --> 00:44:29,397
Sons of bitches!

527
00:44:30,064 --> 00:44:32,025
I can't see shit!

528
00:44:32,233 --> 00:44:36,237
There he is. Get that nigger out from under that wagon.

529
00:44:36,404 --> 00:44:38,615
And get that nigger lover out of the wagon.

530
00:44:38,781 --> 00:44:41,242
- That nigger ain't down here, Big Daddy. - What?

531
00:44:41,409 --> 00:44:43,287
- They tricked us. - Where are they?

532
00:44:52,421 --> 00:44:53,589
Bull's-eye.

533
00:44:56,383 --> 00:44:57,426
Look at them run.

534
00:45:02,598 --> 00:45:05,100
Yeah, cowards tend to do that.

535
00:45:13,234 --> 00:45:14,944
Goddamn it!

536
00:45:19,114 --> 00:45:20,866
Would you care to?

537
00:45:27,748 --> 00:45:29,917
Can't see shit out of this.

538
00:45:30,209 --> 00:45:32,253
- He's getting away. - I got him.

539
00:45:34,338 --> 00:45:35,881
Big Daddy's getting away.

540
00:45:36,048 --> 00:45:37,216
I got him.

541
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,483
Got him.

542
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:01,741
The kid's a natural.

543
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,171
How you know Broomhilda's first masters was German?

544
00:46:16,131 --> 00:46:17,966
Broomhilda's a German name.

545
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:21,219
If they named her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

546
00:46:21,386 --> 00:46:24,264
Lots of gals where you're from named Broomhilda?

547
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:27,350
Broomhilda is the name of a character...

548
00:46:27,517 --> 00:46:31,438
...in the most popular of all the German legends.

549
00:46:31,604 --> 00:46:33,481
There's a story about Broomhilda?

550
00:46:33,648 --> 00:46:35,483
Oh, yes, there is.

551
00:46:41,448 --> 00:46:42,574
Do you know it?

552
00:46:42,741 --> 00:46:44,909
Oh, every German knows that story.

553
00:46:51,292 --> 00:46:53,586
Would you like me to tell you?

554
00:46:54,378 --> 00:47:00,968
Well, Broomhilda was a princess.

555
00:47:02,136 --> 00:47:06,098
She was a daughter of Wotan, god of all gods.

556
00:47:07,183 --> 00:47:10,436
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

557
00:47:10,603 --> 00:47:11,812
What she do?

558
00:47:12,772 --> 00:47:14,315
I can't exactly remember.

559
00:47:14,482 --> 00:47:17,151
She disobeys him in some way.

560
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:20,488
So he puts her on top of the mountain.

561
00:47:20,863 --> 00:47:22,281
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

562
00:47:22,448 --> 00:47:26,452
It's a German legend, there's going to be a mountain in there somewhere.

563
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:30,956
And he puts a fire-breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.

564
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:38,047
And he surrounds her in a circle of hellfire.

565
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:43,803
And there, Broomhilda shall remain...

566
00:47:44,637 --> 00:47:49,892
...unless a hero arises brave enough to save her.

567
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:52,728
Does a fella arise?

568
00:47:52,895 --> 00:47:55,899
Yes, Django, as a matter of fact, he does.

569
00:47:56,066 --> 00:47:57,901
A fella named Siegfried.

570
00:47:58,568 --> 00:48:00,737
Does Siegfried save her?

571
00:48:02,155 --> 00:48:04,658
Quite spectacularly so.

572
00:48:05,534 --> 00:48:09,579
He scales the mountain, because he's not afraid of it.

573
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:14,418
He slays the dragon, because he's not afraid of him.

574
00:48:14,751 --> 00:48:17,671
And he walks through hellfire...

575
00:48:19,506 --> 00:48:22,384
...because Broomhilda's worth it.

576
00:48:25,971 --> 00:48:27,889
I know how he feel.

577
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:32,269
I think I'm just starting to realise that.

578
00:48:37,482 --> 00:48:41,987
Now, look, Django...

579
00:48:44,698 --> 00:48:49,035
...I don't doubt that one day you'll save your lady love...

580
00:48:49,744 --> 00:48:53,582
...but I can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscience.

581
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:58,962
A slave auction town in Mississippi isn't the place for you to visit.

582
00:48:59,129 --> 00:49:02,091
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

583
00:49:05,011 --> 00:49:07,346
But let me ask you a question.

584
00:49:14,479 --> 00:49:17,273
How do you like the bounty hunting business?

585
00:49:18,566 --> 00:49:21,027
Kill white folks and they pay you for it?

586
00:49:21,694 --> 00:49:22,987
What's not to like?

587
00:49:23,154 --> 00:49:25,323
Now, I have to admit, we make a good team.

588
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:28,826
I thought you was mad at me for killing Big John and Little Raj.

589
00:49:28,993 --> 00:49:33,206
Yeah, you were a tad overzealous, but normally that's a good thing.

590
00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:36,083
How'd you like to partner up for the winter?

591
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,919
What you mean, "partner up"?

592
00:49:38,377 --> 00:49:42,423
You work with me through the winter till the snow melts...

593
00:49:43,549 --> 00:49:45,551
...I give you a third of my bounties.

594
00:49:46,802 --> 00:49:50,806
So we make some money this winter, and when the snow melts...

595
00:49:51,224 --> 00:49:54,018
...I'll take you to Greenville myself...

596
00:49:54,185 --> 00:49:57,522
...and we'll find where they sent your wife.

597
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,778
Why you care what happen to me?

598
00:50:04,946 --> 00:50:07,032
Why you care if I find my wife?

599
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:08,492
Frankly...

600
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:12,621
...I've never given anybody their freedom before.

601
00:50:12,788 --> 00:50:17,042
And now that I have, I feel vaguely responsible for you.

602
00:50:17,834 --> 00:50:22,005
Plus, when a German meets a real-life Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.

603
00:50:24,007 --> 00:50:26,260
As a German, I'm obliged to help you...

604
00:50:26,426 --> 00:50:30,097
...on your quest to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.

605
00:52:39,061 --> 00:52:40,104
You got her.

606
00:52:48,237 --> 00:52:51,949
What happened to Mr. "I Wanna Shoot White Folks For Money"?

607
00:52:52,157 --> 00:52:53,492
His son's with him.

608
00:52:53,659 --> 00:52:56,578
Well, good. He'll have a loved one with him.

609
00:52:56,745 --> 00:52:59,581
Maybe even share a last word.

610
00:53:00,999 --> 00:53:03,127
That's better than most of them get.

611
00:53:03,293 --> 00:53:05,921
Damn sight better than he deserves.

612
00:53:13,887 --> 00:53:15,431
Put down the rifle.

613
00:53:18,142 --> 00:53:20,311
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

614
00:53:20,729 --> 00:53:23,481
Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.

615
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:28,820
Now, read it aloud.

616
00:53:29,279 --> 00:53:31,573
Consider that today's lesson.

617
00:53:33,533 --> 00:53:36,453
"Wanted. Dead or alive.

618
00:53:37,245 --> 00:53:40,582
Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall G..."

619
00:53:41,374 --> 00:53:43,251
- Gang. - "Gang."

620
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:47,338
"For murder and stagecoach...

621
00:53:48,965 --> 00:53:50,258
...robbery.

Seven-zero-zero-zero..."

623
00:53:52,135 --> 00:53:53,428
Seven thousand.

624
00:53:53,595 --> 00:53:55,013
Thousand.

625
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:59,142
"Seven thousand dollars for Smitty Bacall...

626

629
00:54:08,151 --> 00:54:09,652
"Members.

630

631
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,701
- Follows. - "Follows."

632
00:54:16,993 --> 00:54:20,288
"Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and..."

633
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:23,709
Crazy Craig Koons.

634
00:54:24,543 --> 00:54:26,921
That is who Smitty Bacall is.

635
00:54:27,379 --> 00:54:32,384
If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at 22, they would never have printed that.

636
00:54:32,843 --> 00:54:36,180
But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches...

637
00:54:36,347 --> 00:54:38,724
...and he didn't mind killing people to do it.

638
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,686
Do you want to save your wife by doing what I do?

639
00:54:44,021 --> 00:54:45,564
This is what I do.

640
00:54:45,731 --> 00:54:49,443
I kill people and sell their corpses for cash.

641
00:54:50,194 --> 00:54:53,739
This corpse is worth $7000.

642
00:54:53,906 --> 00:54:56,700
Now quit your pussyfooting and shoot him.

643
00:55:06,502 --> 00:55:07,711
Pa?

644
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,421
Pa!

645
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:21,517
Here. You need to keep this Smitty Bacall handbill.

646
00:55:21,684 --> 00:55:22,726
Why?

647
00:55:22,893 --> 00:55:27,189
It's good luck. You always keep the handbill of your first bounty.

648
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:16,156
That's accurate.

649
00:57:24,558 --> 00:57:27,645
Doctor, Django, how the hell are you?

650
00:57:28,688 --> 00:57:30,815
Who the hell have you got there?

651
00:57:30,982 --> 00:57:33,067
The Wilson-Lowe Gang.

652
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,112
Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?

653
00:57:36,988 --> 00:57:41,493
Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.

654
00:57:42,953 --> 00:57:45,330
Leave them out here, they ain't going nowhere.

655
00:57:45,497 --> 00:57:49,710
Why don't you come in out of the snow and get yourselves some coffee?

656
00:57:49,876 --> 00:57:52,546
We had a birthday yesterday. Got some cake.

657
00:57:53,005 --> 00:57:54,506
Pretty good.

658
00:58:27,581 --> 00:58:31,001
Keep moving. Get on up to that auction block.

659
00:58:32,335 --> 00:58:35,338
Don't let that mud slow you down. Keep going.

660
00:58:38,133 --> 00:58:39,801
Come on.

661
00:58:51,272 --> 00:58:52,940
Keep going.

662
00:58:55,026 --> 00:58:56,736
"Broomhilda Von Shaft.

663
00:58:56,903 --> 00:58:58,821
Age 27.

664
00:58:58,988 --> 00:59:01,282
'R' on right cheek.

665
00:59:02,116 --> 00:59:04,494
Calvin Candie."

666
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:09,082
He owns the fourth biggest cotton plantation in Mississippi, Candyland.

667
00:59:09,248 --> 00:59:10,541
Candyland?

668
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:14,212
- Oh, you've heard of it. - Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.

669
00:59:14,378 --> 00:59:16,756
Well, apparently, that's where your wife is...

670
00:59:16,923 --> 00:59:19,759
...and that's the repellent gentleman who owns her.

671
00:59:19,926 --> 00:59:22,470
Let's hope she works in the house, not the field.

672
00:59:22,637 --> 00:59:24,680
Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.

673
00:59:24,931 --> 00:59:27,225
She... She pretty.

674
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,769
And she talk good too.

675
00:59:30,853 --> 00:59:33,106
But when they tore her back up...

676
00:59:33,272 --> 00:59:36,734
...and then they burned that runaway "R" on her cheek...

677
00:59:37,443 --> 00:59:38,778
...they goddamned her.

678
00:59:43,366 --> 00:59:47,037
She ain't no field nigger but ain't good enough for the house no more.

679
00:59:47,204 --> 00:59:50,541
- They'll try to make her a comfort girl. - What's a comfort...?

680
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:52,709
Not while I got freedom.

681
00:59:54,378 --> 00:59:56,463
Not while I got my gun.

682
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:01,218
So do we offer to buy her?

683
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:05,264
So...

684
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,225
...say...

685
01:00:10,269 --> 01:00:13,438
...a man wants to buy a horse.

686
01:00:13,605 --> 01:00:15,899
Needs to buy a horse.

687
01:00:16,775 --> 01:00:19,611
He walks up to the farmer's farm, knocks on the door...

688
01:00:19,778 --> 01:00:23,532
...and asks the farmer to buy his horse. You know what the farmer says?

689
01:00:23,699 --> 01:00:26,243
The farmer says no.

690
01:00:27,369 --> 01:00:32,249
Well, I say fuck that farmer. And I'm stealing that horse.

691
01:00:32,416 --> 01:00:34,710
Fair enough. But now you're a horse thief...

692
01:00:34,877 --> 01:00:36,628
...and they hang horse thieves.

693
01:00:36,795 --> 01:00:40,799
The horse goes to its original owner because the horse is his property.

694
01:00:40,966 --> 01:00:44,469
We need her and we need a bill of sale.

695
01:00:44,636 --> 01:00:47,181
If we ain't gonna buy her, how we gonna get her?

696
01:00:48,432 --> 01:00:51,936
May I offer an alternative plan of action?

697
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:53,605
Go ahead.

698
01:00:53,938 --> 01:00:55,356
So...

699
01:00:55,648 --> 01:01:00,653
...the man walks up to the farmer's farm, he knocks on the farmer's door...

700
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:05,783
...and asks not to buy the horse, but the farm.

701
01:01:06,326 --> 01:01:09,495
And makes an offer so ridiculous...

702
01:01:09,662 --> 01:01:12,165
...the farmer is forced to say yes.

703
01:01:13,124 --> 01:01:16,044
- We gonna offer to buy Candyland? - No, it's far too big.

704
01:01:16,211 --> 01:01:19,547
But apparently this farmer ain't all about the farm.

705
01:01:20,548 --> 01:01:22,884
How much do you know about Mandingo fighting?

706
01:01:23,051 --> 01:01:24,093
What?

707
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:26,596
Can you convincingly masquerade as someone...

708
01:01:26,763 --> 01:01:28,890
...who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?

709
01:01:29,057 --> 01:01:30,099
Why?

710
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:33,978
Because my character is that of a big money buyer from Düsseldorf...

711
01:01:34,145 --> 01:01:37,523
...here in Greenville to buy my way into the Mandingo fight game.

712
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:41,527
And your character is a Mandingo expert I hired to help me do it.

713
01:01:41,694 --> 01:01:43,696
They call that "One-Eyed Charly."

714
01:01:51,412 --> 01:01:54,249
We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie.

715
01:01:58,295 --> 01:02:00,214
Thank you.

716
01:02:00,965 --> 01:02:03,467
You want me to play a black slaver?

717
01:02:03,801 --> 01:02:06,428
Ain't nothing lower than a black slaver.

718
01:02:06,637 --> 01:02:10,349
A black slaver is lower than the head house nigger...

719
01:02:10,641 --> 01:02:13,143
...and, buddy, that's pretty fucking low.

720
01:02:14,103 --> 01:02:15,854
Then play him that way.

721
01:02:16,021 --> 01:02:20,192
Give me your black slaver.

722
01:02:31,745 --> 01:02:33,455
Dr. Schultz.

723
01:02:33,622 --> 01:02:36,333
- Good to see you again. - Mr. Moguy.

724
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:40,671
Thank you for assistance in creating the opportunity for this appointment.

725
01:02:40,838 --> 01:02:42,631
Nonsense, it's my job.

726
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:45,718
So this is the One-Eyed Charly I've heard so much about.

727
01:02:45,884 --> 01:02:48,262
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

728
01:02:48,429 --> 01:02:51,223
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer, Leonide Moguy.

729
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:53,142
Just call me Leo.

730
01:02:53,309 --> 01:02:56,645
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room. You all wanna follow me?

731
01:02:56,812 --> 01:02:59,398
How long have you been associated with Mr. Candie?

732
01:02:59,565 --> 01:03:03,778
Calvin's father and I were about 11 when we went to boarding school together.

733
01:03:03,945 --> 01:03:06,823
Calvin's father's father put me through law school.

734
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:10,118
One could almost say I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.

735
01:03:10,285 --> 01:03:12,537
One could almost say yo use a nigger.

736
01:03:12,871 --> 01:03:14,372
What did you say?

737
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:17,167
- I said... - Nothing, he's just being cheeky.

738
01:03:17,709 --> 01:03:22,130
Now, anything else about Mr. Candie that I should know before I meet him?

739
01:03:22,297 --> 01:03:24,507
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.

740
01:03:24,674 --> 01:03:26,217
What civilised people aren't?

741
01:03:26,384 --> 01:03:28,720
And he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mr. Candie.

742
01:03:31,264 --> 01:03:35,769
He doesn't speak French. Don't speak French to him, it'll embarrass him.

743
01:03:38,313 --> 01:03:40,690
Get back on top, now. Turn around.

744
01:03:40,857 --> 01:03:42,359
There you go.

745
01:03:42,525 --> 01:03:44,110
There you go.

746
01:03:45,779 --> 01:03:48,281
Why do you want to get in the Mandingo business?

747
01:03:50,867 --> 01:03:54,788
You don't intend to allow your second to make the proper introductions?

748
01:03:55,747 --> 01:03:58,917
Quit stalling, now. Answer the question.

749
01:04:01,503 --> 01:04:03,505
The awful truth?

750
01:04:03,713 --> 01:04:07,635
I'm bored. This seems like a good bit of fun.

751
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:14,600
Well, come on over.

752
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:17,520
We got us a fight going on that's a good bit of fun.

753
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,025
Won't you accompany me to the bar?

754
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:35,538
You don't wear a hat in the house, white man. Even I know that.

755
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,256
- Dr. Schultz. - What a rare pleasure.

756
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:46,841
Keep fighting, niggers.

757
01:04:47,007 --> 01:04:48,801
And I might add, an honour.

758
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:51,762
Honour to meet you. Have a seat, the pleasure's mine.

759
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:55,391
Get free man Django here whatever he wants.

760
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,893
And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.

761
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:20,667
Use your weight, boy, use your weight! There you go.

762
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,128
He's much bigger and stronger!

763
01:05:23,295 --> 01:05:24,838
Come on, now!

764
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:27,549
He's not doing what I told him, for God's sakes.

765
01:05:27,883 --> 01:05:29,926
Bravo, bravo, Luigi.

766
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:34,890
Come on, now, boy! It's a fight to the death!

767
01:05:35,724 --> 01:05:37,642
You either hit him or are you ain't?

768
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:48,195
Big Fred, come on!

769
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,114
Turn him around! Now, come...!

770
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,744
Use your strength, boy!

771
01:05:56,328 --> 01:05:58,872
Come on, now! Use your strength!

772
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,167
There you go.

773
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,045
There you go!

774
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:06,254
Look at that.

775
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:10,175
See, I told you to put some more power in there.

776
01:06:10,342 --> 01:06:12,344
Do what I told you, boy.

777
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:14,179
There you go.

778
01:06:14,347 --> 01:06:15,515
No.

779
01:06:15,681 --> 01:06:16,682
Do what I told you!

780
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:20,394
Blind him black, boy! Blind him black!

781
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:23,606
Oh, no, Luigi.

782
01:06:25,858 --> 01:06:26,901
Yeah!

783
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:45,461
Finish him.

784
01:06:49,882 --> 01:06:51,467
Go on, boy, finish him.

785
01:06:56,097 --> 01:06:59,183
That's why they call him Big Fred. Worth every penny.

786
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,435
Well, arrivederci, Luigi.

787
01:07:01,602 --> 01:07:03,854
Come on up, now, boy. Get yourself a rest.

788
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:06,816
You did a fine job. A real fine job.

789
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,985
Mercedes.

790
01:07:30,257 --> 01:07:31,717
Tequila.

791
01:07:41,476 --> 01:07:43,186
What's your name?

792
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:46,815
Django.

793
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:50,902
Can you spell it?

794
01:07:52,904 --> 01:07:56,908
D-J-A-N-G-O.

795
01:07:58,452 --> 01:07:59,995
The D is silent.

796
01:08:00,537 --> 01:08:02,122
I know.

797
01:08:09,755 --> 01:08:13,216
Mr. Moguy, I want you to take care of my new boy here.

798
01:08:13,383 --> 01:08:17,679
You find him a room with a soft bed, then bring him a pony to lick his pole.

799
01:08:17,846 --> 01:08:20,932
Be ready to travel to Candyland tomorrow morning, you hear?

800
01:08:21,099 --> 01:08:22,476
- Yes, sir. - Before you go...

801
01:08:22,643 --> 01:08:26,397
Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.

802
01:08:29,859 --> 01:08:32,945
You enjoy that, boy. You've earned it.

803
01:08:33,112 --> 01:08:34,489
Yes, sir.

804
01:08:43,498 --> 01:08:44,666
What's your name, boy?

805
01:08:45,249 --> 01:08:48,086
His name is Django Freeman.

806
01:08:51,089 --> 01:08:52,757
Where'd you dig him up?

807
01:08:52,924 --> 01:08:56,844
A fortuitous turn of events brought Django and myself together.

808
01:08:57,804 --> 01:09:00,098
I've heard tell about you.

809
01:09:00,556 --> 01:09:03,476
You been telling everybody them Mandingos ain't no good.

810
01:09:03,643 --> 01:09:07,397
Nothing nobody is selling is worth buying. I'm curious.

811
01:09:07,563 --> 01:09:10,066
What makes you such a Mandingo expert?

812
01:09:12,068 --> 01:09:14,487
I'm curious what makes you so curious.

813
01:09:17,824 --> 01:09:20,618
- What did you say, boy? - Calm down, Butch.

814
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:22,203
No offence given...

815
01:09:22,912 --> 01:09:24,163
...none taken.

816
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:25,915
Monsieur Candie...

817
01:09:26,082 --> 01:09:29,878
...I'd appreciate if you could direct your line of enquiry toward me.

818
01:09:30,045 --> 01:09:31,380
One...

819
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:35,300
...you do not have a drink. Can I get you a refreshment?

820
01:09:35,467 --> 01:09:37,970
Yes. I'll have a beer.

821
01:09:38,137 --> 01:09:40,431
Roscoe, a beer for the man with the beard...

822
01:09:40,597 --> 01:09:44,435
...and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver. Do not spare the rum.

823
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:46,061
Doc...

824
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:50,107
...I am a seasoned slaver. You are... Well, you are a neophyte.

825
01:09:50,274 --> 01:09:53,360
I'm simply trying to ascertain if this cowboy here...

826
01:09:53,527 --> 01:09:55,487
...is taking advantage of you.

827
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:00,367
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...

828
01:10:00,534 --> 01:10:02,703
...I didn't seek you out for your advice.

829
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:07,249
I sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger at above top-dollar market price.

830
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:10,669
I was under the impression, when you granted me an audience...

831
01:10:10,836 --> 01:10:13,088
...it would be to discuss business.

832
01:10:15,716 --> 01:10:18,051
Well, we weren't talking business yet.

833
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:20,888
We were discussing my curiosity.

834
01:10:22,806 --> 01:10:23,849
Thank you.

835
01:10:24,016 --> 01:10:26,894
Roscoe, Coco, go outside and play.

836
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:31,982
Sheba, you stay right there.

837
01:10:32,232 --> 01:10:33,818
I know you didn't mean me.

838
01:10:37,155 --> 01:10:38,615
German.

839
01:10:39,073 --> 01:10:40,700
Now, according to Moguy...

840
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:42,911
...if I do business with you...

841
01:10:43,077 --> 01:10:45,079
...I'm doing business with both y'all.

842
01:10:45,246 --> 01:10:47,707
He does the eyeballing, you the billfold?

843
01:10:47,874 --> 01:10:51,628
Well, you don't make it sound too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

844
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:55,256
So...

845
01:10:55,757 --> 01:10:59,344
...Bright Boy, Moguy tells me you looked over my African flesh...

846
01:10:59,511 --> 01:11:01,763
...and you was none too impressed, huh?

847
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,431
Not for top dollar.

848
01:11:05,433 --> 01:11:07,435
Then we got nothing more to talk about.

849
01:11:07,602 --> 01:11:09,771
You wanna buy a beat-ass nigger from me...

850
01:11:09,938 --> 01:11:12,398
...those are the beat-ass niggers I wanna sell.

851
01:11:12,565 --> 01:11:15,193
He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell.

852
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,571
He wants the nigger you don't wanna sell.

853
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:23,368
Well, I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna sell.

854
01:11:25,328 --> 01:11:28,998
Well, you won't sell your best.

855
01:11:29,165 --> 01:11:31,543
You won't even sell your second best.

856
01:11:31,709 --> 01:11:35,213
But your third best? You don't want to sell him either.

857
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:39,760
But if I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be forced to consider it...

858
01:11:40,594 --> 01:11:42,263
...who knows what could happen?

859
01:11:44,723 --> 01:11:46,934
And what do you consider ridiculous?

860
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:52,398
For a truly talented specimen, the right nigger?

861
01:11:53,858 --> 01:11:55,734
How much would you say, Django?

862
01:11:59,113 --> 01:12:01,323
Twelve thousand dollars.

863
01:12:05,619 --> 01:12:09,415
Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity...

864
01:12:09,582 --> 01:12:11,876
...but now you have my attention.

865
01:12:25,306 --> 01:12:27,516
Willie. Willie.

866
01:12:27,683 --> 01:12:29,977
Hold up. Hold up.

867
01:12:30,978 --> 01:12:33,564
- Good morning, gentlemen. - Good Dr. Schultz.

868
01:12:33,939 --> 01:12:37,568
- Beautiful morning, isn't it? - You couldn't have picked a better one.

869
01:12:37,735 --> 01:12:40,696
Won't you take a ride with us here in the Victoria?

870
01:12:40,863 --> 01:12:42,157
Oh, thank you very much.

871
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:44,784
You can tie your horse up back there.

872
01:12:52,751 --> 01:12:54,377
Django.

873
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,594
Where I part company from many of my phrenologist colleagues...

874
01:13:02,761 --> 01:13:05,847
...is I believe there is a level above bright...

875
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:08,808
...above talented, above loyal...

876
01:13:08,975 --> 01:13:12,187
...that a nigger can aspire to.

877
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:16,858
Say, one nigger that just pops up in 10,000.

878
01:13:17,108 --> 01:13:18,652
The exceptional nigger.

879
01:13:19,653 --> 01:13:22,197
Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?

880
01:13:22,822 --> 01:13:24,032
The sun is up.

881
01:13:25,158 --> 01:13:27,077
It's shining on all of us.

882
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:33,583
Have a seat, doc.

883
01:13:33,959 --> 01:13:36,211
Thank you. Quite an honour.

884
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:38,171
- The honour is all ours. - Thank you.

885
01:13:38,588 --> 01:13:41,716
But I do believe that given time...

886
01:13:41,883 --> 01:13:45,095
...exceptional niggers like Bright Boy here...

887
01:13:45,512 --> 01:13:48,057
...become if not frequent...

888
01:13:48,683 --> 01:13:50,601
...more frequent.

889
01:13:52,103 --> 01:13:53,479
Right, boy?

890
01:13:54,355 --> 01:13:56,857
You are that 1 in 10,000.

891
01:13:57,024 --> 01:14:00,152
The name of the game is keep up, not catch up, nigger.

892
01:14:16,002 --> 01:14:18,796
- Touch your guns, you die. - Everybody calm down.

893
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:21,215
Now, I saw the whole thing. No harm done.

894
01:14:21,382 --> 01:14:24,552
- Are you kidding me? This nigger just... - I said no harm done!

895
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:26,721
Now take your hand off your pistol!

896
01:14:28,347 --> 01:14:31,559
Butch, that means you too.

897
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:34,520
Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.

898
01:14:36,647 --> 01:14:39,025
Hoot, get back up on your horse.

899
01:14:39,692 --> 01:14:41,235
He broke my collarbone.

900
01:14:41,402 --> 01:14:43,946
For God's sake, somebody please help Hoot here...

901
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:45,823
...back up on his goddamn horse.

902
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:48,951
- Yes, sir, boss. - Oh, now, you are one lucky nigger.

903
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:51,788
Better listen to your boss, white boy.

904
01:14:51,955 --> 01:14:54,416
I'm gonna go walking in the moonlight with you.

905
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:56,376
You wanna hold my hand?

906
01:15:02,966 --> 01:15:05,761
Willie, take us home.

907
01:15:07,763 --> 01:15:09,765
Here we go. Start moving.

908
01:15:16,354 --> 01:15:17,814
Head them out.

909
01:16:03,027 --> 01:16:05,196
You got a problem with your eyeball, boy?

910
01:16:05,363 --> 01:16:07,615
- No, sir. - You want a boot heel in it?

911
01:16:08,908 --> 01:16:09,951
No, sir.

912
01:16:10,118 --> 01:16:12,870
Then you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

913
01:16:13,121 --> 01:16:16,624
Flash that look at me again, I'll give you a reason not to like me.

914
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:18,334
Now move, nigger.

915
01:16:20,169 --> 01:16:22,380
You niggers are gonna understand something.

916
01:16:22,547 --> 01:16:24,757
I'm worse than any of these white men here.

917
01:16:24,924 --> 01:16:28,553
You get the molasses out your ass, keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

918
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:31,430
He is a rambunctious sort, ain't he?

919
01:16:31,597 --> 01:16:32,807
Indeed.

920
01:16:35,351 --> 01:16:38,813
May we stop for a moment so I may put a word in my man's ear?

921
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:42,692
I'm expecting to fall in love once I see the specimens at Candyland...

922
01:16:42,859 --> 01:16:44,318
...so before that moment...

923
01:16:44,485 --> 01:16:48,197
...it would be good if I could have a confidential strategy meeting...

924
01:16:48,364 --> 01:16:50,491
...with my confidant.

925
01:16:53,494 --> 01:16:55,288
What the hell you doing?

926
01:16:55,454 --> 01:16:58,040
I confirmed that Broomhilda's at Candyland.

927
01:17:01,378 --> 01:17:04,131
- You're sure it's her? - He didn't call her by name...

928
01:17:04,298 --> 01:17:07,843
...but she's a young lady, whip marks on her back and speaks German.

929
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:09,720
While it's not wise to assume...

930
01:17:09,887 --> 01:17:12,347
...in this instance, I think it's pretty safe.

931
01:17:12,514 --> 01:17:13,974
Point being...

932
01:17:14,141 --> 01:17:17,144
...don't get so carried away with your retribution.

933
01:17:17,311 --> 01:17:19,062
You lose sight of why we're here.

934
01:17:19,229 --> 01:17:23,692
- You think I lost sight of that? - Yes, I do. Stop antagonizing Candie.

935
01:17:23,859 --> 01:17:28,989
You're going to blow this whole charade, or more than likely get us both killed.

936
01:17:29,156 --> 01:17:33,869
And I, for one, don't intend to die in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, U.S.A.

937
01:17:34,036 --> 01:17:37,414
I'm not antagonizing him. I'm intriguing him.

938
01:17:37,581 --> 01:17:40,375
You're yelling abuse at these poor slaves.

939
01:17:40,542 --> 01:17:42,794
I recall the man...

940
01:17:43,003 --> 01:17:46,089
...who had me kill another man in front of his son...

941
01:17:46,256 --> 01:17:48,342
...and he didn't bat a eye.

942
01:17:49,551 --> 01:17:50,594
You remember that?

943
01:17:52,721 --> 01:17:54,181
Yeah, of course I remember.

944
01:17:54,348 --> 01:17:57,893
What you said was that this is my world...

945
01:17:58,644 --> 01:18:01,063
...and in my world you gotta get dirty.

946
01:18:01,813 --> 01:18:05,026
So that's what I'm doing, I'm getting dirty.

947
01:18:08,446 --> 01:18:11,950
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad...

948
01:18:13,076 --> 01:18:15,161
...but that was the general gist.

949
01:18:18,957 --> 01:18:20,875
See you at Candyland.

950
01:18:28,091 --> 01:18:31,052
All right, niggers, back at it.

951
01:18:31,928 --> 01:18:34,180
That means you too, Moonlight.

952
01:19:21,145 --> 01:19:22,187
I'll be.

953
01:19:22,563 --> 01:19:24,189
D'Artagnan!

954
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:27,568
Now, boy, why do a fool thing like run off?

955
01:19:27,735 --> 01:19:30,112
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

956
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:31,405
Yes, you can.

957
01:19:31,572 --> 01:19:34,825
You might not be able to win, but your ass can fight.

958
01:19:35,284 --> 01:19:39,163
Mr. Stonesipher, would you shut these dogs up? I cannot hear myself think.

959
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:41,915
Quieten down, Marsha! Marsha, hush up!

960
01:19:42,082 --> 01:19:43,542
Marsha! Hush up!

961
01:19:44,084 --> 01:19:47,629
Hey! Get these goddamn dogs away from this nigger!

962
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:01,101
- Well, now, boy, get on out that tree. - Yes, sir.

963
01:20:24,501 --> 01:20:26,461
How long was he loose?

964
01:20:26,753 --> 01:20:29,923
A night. Day.

965
01:20:30,173 --> 01:20:32,092
Half the other night.

966
01:20:32,801 --> 01:20:34,636
How far he get off the property?

967
01:20:34,803 --> 01:20:39,682
About 20 miles off prop. Pretty far considering that limp he got.

968
01:20:41,434 --> 01:20:44,771
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan supposed to fight on Friday?

969
01:20:44,938 --> 01:20:46,898
One of this new lot.

970
01:20:47,649 --> 01:20:50,777
Way he looks now, a blind Indian wouldn't bet a bead on him.

971
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:53,780
Please, Monsieur Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.

972
01:20:53,947 --> 01:20:57,325
Now, now, now. Now, no begging.

973
01:20:57,534 --> 01:21:00,328
No playing on my soft heart.

974
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:06,626
- You in trouble now, son. - Yes, sir.

975
01:21:08,878 --> 01:21:12,674
You know, I done paid $500 for you.

976
01:21:12,841 --> 01:21:15,051
When I pay $500...

977
01:21:15,218 --> 01:21:19,473
...I expect to get five fights out of a nigger before he roll over and play dead.

978
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:20,683
Sir.

979
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:23,894
Gotta understand I'm running a business here.

980
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:27,064
- You fought three fights. - But I won every one.

981
01:21:27,231 --> 01:21:28,691
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

982
01:21:28,858 --> 01:21:32,570
But that last one, you muddled the line between winning and losing.

983
01:21:35,656 --> 01:21:37,783
Still, the fact remains:

984
01:21:37,992 --> 01:21:41,662
I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights.

985
01:21:41,996 --> 01:21:44,248
So, what about my $500, huh?

986
01:21:46,208 --> 01:21:48,544
What about my $500?

987
01:21:49,545 --> 01:21:51,130
You gonna reimburse me?

988
01:21:57,303 --> 01:21:59,638
You even know what "reimburse" means?

989
01:22:08,022 --> 01:22:09,773
I'll reimburse you.

990
01:22:13,569 --> 01:22:14,695
You will?

991
01:22:15,988 --> 01:22:17,448
Yep.

992
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:22,495
You'll pay $500...

993
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:26,666
...for practically a one-eyed old Joe ain't fit to push a broom?

994
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:27,876
No, he won't.

995
01:22:30,003 --> 01:22:32,422
He just tired of you toying with him is all.

996
01:22:33,173 --> 01:22:35,133
Matter of fact, so am I.

997
01:22:35,425 --> 01:22:37,719
We ain't paying a penny for that pickaninny.

998
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:40,639
Ain't got no use for him. Ain't that right, doc?

999
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:42,849
You heard him.

1000
01:22:51,942 --> 01:22:56,530
You're gonna have to excuse Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

1001
01:22:56,696 --> 01:22:59,991
He ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life.

1002
01:23:00,158 --> 01:23:02,160
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1003
01:23:04,538 --> 01:23:06,081
That's right.

1004
01:23:06,873 --> 01:23:08,333
For that matter...

1005
01:23:09,668 --> 01:23:11,211
...nor have I.

1006
01:23:17,259 --> 01:23:18,718
Now...

1007
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:23,265
...seeing as you won't pay a penny for this pickaninny here...

1008
01:23:25,183 --> 01:23:28,437
...you won't mind me handling this nigger any way I see fit?

1009
01:23:29,605 --> 01:23:31,482
He's your nigger.

1010
01:23:34,902 --> 01:23:35,945
Mr. Stonesipher?

1011
01:23:37,947 --> 01:23:41,576
Let Marsha and her bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1012
01:23:41,826 --> 01:23:43,661
Marsha!

1013
01:23:43,828 --> 01:23:45,788
Marsha, hey, get him!

1014
01:23:48,499 --> 01:23:50,251
Get him, get him!

1015
01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:28,539
Your boss looks green around the gills for a blood sport like nigger fighting.

1016
01:24:28,706 --> 01:24:33,086
No. He just ain't used to seeing a man ripped apart by dogs is all.

1017
01:24:36,006 --> 01:24:37,466
You are used to it?

1018
01:24:37,633 --> 01:24:41,136
I'm just a little more used to Americans than he is.

1019
01:24:41,845 --> 01:24:45,140
Now, Monsieur Candie...

1020
01:24:45,307 --> 01:24:47,017
...whenever you're ready.

1021
01:24:47,351 --> 01:24:51,563
We rode five hours so you could show off your stock. Let's get to it.

1022
01:24:53,982 --> 01:24:58,320
Because as of now, if he's an example, I ain't impressed.

1023
01:25:00,364 --> 01:25:01,907
Follow me.

1024
01:26:59,318 --> 01:27:01,779
Line them up to the left here now, boy.

1025
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:04,740
Stand up straight, now!

1026
01:27:05,824 --> 01:27:07,117
Get up there.

1027
01:27:07,284 --> 01:27:09,703
Get up there, boy. Come on.

1028
01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:13,957
I said give me a line! Give me a line! Get in line there! Straighten up!

1029
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,186
Hello! Stephen, my boy.

1030
01:28:15,353 --> 01:28:18,189
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hello, my ass.

1031
01:28:18,356 --> 01:28:21,025
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1032
01:28:21,192 --> 01:28:25,196
Stephen, you have nails for breakfast? What's the matter? Why you so ornery?

1033
01:28:25,363 --> 01:28:27,407
- You miss me, huh? - Oh, yes, sir.

1034
01:28:27,574 --> 01:28:30,994
I miss you like a hog miss slop.

1035
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:34,998
Like a baby miss mammy's titty.

1036
01:28:35,164 --> 01:28:40,086
I miss you like I misses a rock in my shoe.

1037
01:28:41,546 --> 01:28:45,967
Now, I asked you: Who this nigger on that nag?

1038
01:28:46,134 --> 01:28:47,760
Hey, Snowball?

1039
01:28:49,095 --> 01:28:52,600
Wanna know my name or the name of my horse, you ask me.

1040
01:28:52,766 --> 01:28:55,686
Just who the hell you calling "Snowball," horse boy?

1041
01:28:55,853 --> 01:28:59,481
I'll snatch your black ass off that nag so fast, make your head spin.

1042
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,358
Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.

1043
01:29:01,525 --> 01:29:05,696
Let's keep it funny. Django here's a Freeman.

1044
01:29:05,905 --> 01:29:08,157
- This nigger here? - That nigger there.

1045
01:29:08,324 --> 01:29:10,618
Let me at least introduce the two of you.

1046
01:29:10,784 --> 01:29:14,705
Django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen.

1047
01:29:14,872 --> 01:29:18,125
Stephen, this here's Django. You two ought to hate each other.

1048
01:29:18,292 --> 01:29:22,129
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger you feels the need to entertain?

1049
01:29:22,296 --> 01:29:26,383
Django and his friend in grey here, Dr. Schultz, are customers.

1050
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:28,052
They are our guests, Stephen.

1051
01:29:28,218 --> 01:29:31,680
And you, you old decrepit bastard, ought to show them hospitality.

1052
01:29:31,847 --> 01:29:33,891
- You understand that? - Him I understand.

1053
01:29:34,058 --> 01:29:36,602
Don't know why I got to take lip off this nigger.

1054
01:29:36,769 --> 01:29:39,480
You don't have to know why. Do you understand?

1055
01:29:39,772 --> 01:29:42,775
- Yes, sir. I understand. - Well, good.

1056
01:29:42,942 --> 01:29:46,820
They're spending the night. Go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.

1057
01:29:47,154 --> 01:29:48,822
He gonna stay in the Big House?

1058
01:29:48,989 --> 01:29:51,325
Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.

1059
01:29:51,492 --> 01:29:53,994
- In the Big House? - You got a problem with that?

1060
01:29:54,161 --> 01:29:56,373
No, I ain't got no problem with it...

1061
01:29:56,539 --> 01:29:59,542
...if you ain't got no problem burning the bed, sheets...

1062
01:29:59,709 --> 01:30:01,461
...when this motherfucker's gone.

1063
01:30:01,628 --> 01:30:03,797
That is my problem. They are mine to burn.

1064
01:30:03,964 --> 01:30:06,174
Your problem is making a good impression.

1065
01:30:06,341 --> 01:30:10,845
I want you to start solving that problem and get them goddamn rooms ready!

1066
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:14,432
Yes, sir, Monsieur Candie.

1067
01:30:15,308 --> 01:30:16,643
Go on, now.

1068
01:30:17,018 --> 01:30:20,146
Can't believe you brought a nigger to stay in the Big House.

1069
01:30:20,313 --> 01:30:23,441
- Your daddy rolling over in his grave. - Man, the lip on him.

1070
01:30:23,608 --> 01:30:26,361
He's getting worse and worse. Now...

1071
01:30:26,653 --> 01:30:31,366
Where is my beautiful sister?!

1072
01:30:31,533 --> 01:30:33,535
There she is!

1073
01:30:34,911 --> 01:30:39,916
Dr. Schultz, this attractive Southern belle is my widowed sister.

1074
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:44,421
Darling, you are a tonic for tired eyes.

1075
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:48,550
May I present to you Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly?

1076
01:30:48,717 --> 01:30:52,345
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly. Y'all get your ass over by that pen.

1077
01:30:52,512 --> 01:30:54,806
- Come on, Charly. Go on. - Let's go. Come on.

1078
01:30:54,973 --> 01:30:57,475
You know where it is. Like you on a rope.

1079
01:30:58,727 --> 01:31:01,772
Niggers don't walk around here, niggers run.

1080
01:31:01,939 --> 01:31:03,315
Monsieur Candie?

1081
01:31:05,484 --> 01:31:09,238
Yeah. About that matter about the nigger girl you were talking about?

1082
01:31:09,405 --> 01:31:10,448
Nigger gal?

1083
01:31:10,614 --> 01:31:14,160
Yeah, I believe you mentioned she spoke German.

1084
01:31:14,326 --> 01:31:16,412
Yes, Hildi, what about them?

1085
01:31:16,579 --> 01:31:21,083
Do you think before the demonstration, you could send her around to my room?

1086
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:24,754
You little dickens, you. I don't see why not.

1087
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:28,758
Stephen, when you get through showing them their rooms, go fetch Hildi...

1088
01:31:28,924 --> 01:31:32,470
...get her cleaned up real nice and sent to Dr. Schultz's room here.

1089
01:31:32,636 --> 01:31:36,807
Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir, there's something I ain't told you about yet.

1090
01:31:36,974 --> 01:31:40,811
- What? - Hildi in the hot box.

1091
01:31:42,188 --> 01:31:43,397
What's she doing there?

1092
01:31:43,564 --> 01:31:47,693
What you think she doing there in the hot box? She being punished.

1093
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:50,404
- What she do? - She run off again.

1094
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:53,491
Jesus Christ, how many people ran away while I was gone?

1095
01:31:53,657 --> 01:31:55,701
- Two. - When did she go?

1096
01:31:55,868 --> 01:31:58,579
Last night. They brung her back this morning.

1097
01:31:59,246 --> 01:32:02,124
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?

1098
01:32:02,333 --> 01:32:05,837
Lucky for her, they was out chasing D'Artagnan's ass.

1099
01:32:06,004 --> 01:32:09,758
Bill and Cody went looking for her, found her, brung her back.

1100
01:32:09,925 --> 01:32:11,301
Now, she a little beat up.

1101
01:32:11,468 --> 01:32:14,763
She done that to her own damn self running through them bushes.

1102
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:16,431
How long she been in the box?

1103
01:32:16,598 --> 01:32:19,518
How long do you think she been in there? All damn day.

1104
01:32:19,684 --> 01:32:22,395
And the little bitch got 10 more days be in there.

1105
01:32:22,979 --> 01:32:25,607
- Still, take her out. - Take her out? Why?

1106
01:32:25,774 --> 01:32:27,651
Because I said so, that's why.

1107
01:32:27,818 --> 01:32:30,612
Dr. Schultz is my guest. Hildi is my nigger.

1108
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:33,949
Southern hospitality dictates I make her available to him.

1109
01:32:34,116 --> 01:32:37,202
- But, Monsieur Candie, she run off. - Jesus Christ, Stephen.

1110
01:32:37,369 --> 01:32:40,372
What is the point of having a nigger that speaks German...

1111
01:32:40,539 --> 01:32:43,166
...if you can't wheel them out when you have a German guest?

1112
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:46,920
Now, I realise it is inconvenient, but still, you take her ass out.

1113
01:32:47,087 --> 01:32:48,588
Yes, sir.

1114
01:32:49,714 --> 01:32:52,300
Lara Lee. Will you and Cora be responsible...

1115
01:32:52,467 --> 01:32:56,096
...for getting Hildi cleaned up and presentable for Dr. Schultz here?

1116
01:32:56,263 --> 01:32:59,182
- Of course, darling. - Now, gentlemen, I do apologise...

1117
01:32:59,349 --> 01:33:02,394
...but I am weary from our travels beyond words.

1118
01:33:02,561 --> 01:33:05,647
It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.

1119
01:33:10,111 --> 01:33:13,239
Y'all done heard the man! Get her ass up out of there!

1120
01:33:13,406 --> 01:33:17,076
Cora, come here. Get over there and get her cleaned up...

1121
01:33:17,243 --> 01:33:19,162
...bring her back over here to Dr...

1122
01:33:19,328 --> 01:33:21,664
- What he say your name is? Shoots? - Schultz.

1123
01:33:21,831 --> 01:33:22,874
Schultz.

1124
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,835
- Get her back over here. Hurry up, girl. - Yes, sir.

1125
01:34:11,297 --> 01:34:13,883
Come on, girl. Stand up.

1126
01:34:14,968 --> 01:34:16,553
No!

1127
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:48,377
Is you coming with me or is you gonna sleep in that little box over yonder?

1128
01:36:22,555 --> 01:36:24,224
Hello, ladies.

1129
01:36:24,391 --> 01:36:28,020
Dr. Schultz. May I introduce to you Broomhilda?

1130
01:36:31,732 --> 01:36:34,234
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1131
01:36:35,569 --> 01:36:37,863
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1132
01:36:39,073 --> 01:36:41,367
I've heard a lot of good things about you.

1133
01:36:41,533 --> 01:36:45,329
Well, it's not every nigger speaks German, don't you know.

1134
01:36:47,456 --> 01:36:49,583
As I look at you now, Broomhilda...

1135
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,963
...I can see all the passions you inspire are completely justified.

1136
01:36:58,050 --> 01:37:00,594
The doctor here speaks German.

1137
01:37:02,221 --> 01:37:04,223
And I've been informed you do as well?

1138
01:37:05,641 --> 01:37:08,227
Go ahead, girl. Speak a little German.

1139
01:37:16,402 --> 01:37:18,362
Astonishing.

1140
01:37:25,202 --> 01:37:27,538
- And I shall bring y... - Much obliged.

1141
01:38:01,489 --> 01:38:03,324
Don't be afraid.

1142
01:38:42,448 --> 01:38:43,866
Pardon.

1143
01:40:37,939 --> 01:40:39,441
Hey, Little Troublemaker.

1144
01:40:48,492 --> 01:40:51,495
You silver-tongued devil, you.

1145
01:40:52,830 --> 01:40:54,624
- Hurry up. - These ready, Miss Cora.

1146
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:56,167
No, they drinking tonight.

1147
01:40:56,334 --> 01:40:59,170
Go get the jug with the red stuff Monsieur Candie like.

1148
01:40:59,337 --> 01:41:02,632
- Get your big pretty ass out the way. - You know you like it.

1149
01:41:02,798 --> 01:41:05,009
That's because you knows what I like.

1150
01:41:05,176 --> 01:41:07,136
Come on with these biscuits, girl.

1151
01:41:07,303 --> 01:41:12,558
Look, Monsieur Candie, they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1152
01:41:13,017 --> 01:41:17,772
But the best three by far were Samson...

1153
01:41:18,272 --> 01:41:20,399
- What's that other one's name? - Goldie.

1154
01:41:20,566 --> 01:41:21,609
Goldie.

1155
01:41:21,776 --> 01:41:23,819
And Eskimo Joe.

1156
01:41:23,986 --> 01:41:26,572
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1157
01:41:26,739 --> 01:41:29,867
You never know how these nigger nicknames get started.

1158
01:41:30,034 --> 01:41:33,913
His name was Joe, maybe one day he said he was cold. Who knows?

1159
01:41:36,499 --> 01:41:39,960
Well, regardless, Samson's your best.

1160
01:41:40,127 --> 01:41:41,671
We all know that.

1161
01:41:41,837 --> 01:41:46,593
You will never sell him, and I can see why. He's a champion.

1162
01:41:47,177 --> 01:41:49,888
All three are champions.

1163
01:41:50,097 --> 01:41:52,057
Samson's the champion.

1164
01:41:52,349 --> 01:41:54,101
Them other two pretty good.

1165
01:41:55,394 --> 01:41:58,230
- Calvin, what's this nigger you let...? - It's all right.

1166
01:41:58,397 --> 01:42:00,565
You have to understand, Monsieur Candie...

1167
01:42:00,732 --> 01:42:04,111
...while admittedly a neophyte in the nigger fight game...

1168
01:42:04,277 --> 01:42:08,532
...I do have a little bit of a background in the European travelling circus.

1169
01:42:08,699 --> 01:42:09,866
Is that right?

1170
01:42:10,033 --> 01:42:14,579
Hence, I have big ideas when it comes to presentation.

1171
01:42:15,205 --> 01:42:17,708
I need something more than just a big nigger.

1172
01:42:19,626 --> 01:42:21,795
Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1173
01:42:21,962 --> 01:42:24,673
- Need to have what? What? - Panache.

1174
01:42:25,215 --> 01:42:27,884
- A sense of showmanship. - Showmanship, yes.

1175
01:42:28,051 --> 01:42:31,346
I want to be able to bill him as the Black Hercules.

1176
01:42:33,056 --> 01:42:36,768
- The Black Hercules. Isn't that clever? - More like Nigger-les.

1177
01:42:38,228 --> 01:42:40,397
I said, and I quote:

1178
01:42:40,731 --> 01:42:44,025
"I would pay top dollar for...

1179
01:42:44,192 --> 01:42:46,778
...the right nigger."

1180
01:42:47,154 --> 01:42:51,159
Now, I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger, per se.

1181
01:42:51,451 --> 01:42:54,579
But is he right as rain?

1182
01:42:55,329 --> 01:43:00,460
Oh, Dr. Schultz, I will have you know there's no one in the nigger fight game...

1183
01:43:00,626 --> 01:43:03,087
...that appreciates the value of showmanship...

1184
01:43:03,254 --> 01:43:05,798
- ...more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. - Nobody.

1185
01:43:05,965 --> 01:43:09,844
But one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game.

1186
01:43:10,011 --> 01:43:12,138
And that is a nigger that can win fights.

1187
01:43:13,222 --> 01:43:17,435
Now, that should be your first, second, third, fourth and fifth concern.

1188
01:43:17,602 --> 01:43:20,188
After you have that, and you know you have that...

1189
01:43:20,354 --> 01:43:23,483
...then you can start to implement a grand design.

1190
01:43:23,858 --> 01:43:26,569
In other words, first thing is first.

1191
01:43:26,736 --> 01:43:28,154
First things first.

1192
01:43:37,246 --> 01:43:39,332
I see you two getting on.

1193
01:43:39,957 --> 01:43:41,501
Famously.

1194
01:43:42,210 --> 01:43:43,377
Oh, Monsieur Candie...

1195
01:43:43,544 --> 01:43:48,007
...you cannot imagine what it's like not to hear your native tongue in four years.

1196
01:43:48,174 --> 01:43:51,135
Well, hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

1197
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:56,975
Two weeks in Boston. Monsieur Candie, you a mess.

1198
01:43:57,684 --> 01:43:59,603
Two weeks in Boston.

1199
01:43:59,770 --> 01:44:04,900
I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue.

1200
01:44:05,067 --> 01:44:09,279
And Hildi is a charming conversation companion.

1201
01:44:09,446 --> 01:44:11,281
Well, be careful now, Dr. Schultz.

1202
01:44:11,448 --> 01:44:14,201
You might have caught a little dose of nigger love.

1203
01:44:14,576 --> 01:44:16,662
Nigger love's a powerful emotion, boy.

1204
01:44:16,829 --> 01:44:20,541
It's like a pool of black tar. Once it catches your ass, you caught.

1205
01:44:20,707 --> 01:44:22,709
Yes, sir, you stuck.

1206
01:44:23,710 --> 01:44:25,254
I don't know, doctor.

1207
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:28,382
You can lay on all the German sweet talk you want...

1208
01:44:28,549 --> 01:44:32,594
...but it looks like this pony's got big eyes for Django.

1209
01:44:34,638 --> 01:44:37,266
Well, naturally.

1210
01:44:37,432 --> 01:44:40,853
It is the soaring eagle that attracts her attention...

1211
01:44:41,019 --> 01:44:43,188
...not the plucked chicken.

1212
01:44:44,106 --> 01:44:46,275
Dr. Schultz, don't be so down on yourself.

1213
01:44:46,441 --> 01:44:48,735
You are quite the dapper European gentleman.

1214
01:44:48,902 --> 01:44:52,281
To clean these dishes, put your elbow in these dishes, you hear?

1215
01:44:52,447 --> 01:44:54,908
You know that nigger, don't you?

1216
01:44:55,409 --> 01:44:56,702
- Who? - "Who?"

1217
01:44:56,869 --> 01:45:00,163
Don't "who" me, bitch. You know who I'm talking about.

1218
01:45:01,666 --> 01:45:03,459
At the table?

1219
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:05,295
I don't know him.

1220
01:45:05,461 --> 01:45:06,880
You don't know him.

1221
01:45:07,046 --> 01:45:09,757
- No. - "No," what?

1222
01:45:10,049 --> 01:45:11,676
No, sir.

1223
01:45:15,930 --> 01:45:18,474
You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?

1224
01:45:22,645 --> 01:45:24,147
Okay.

1225
01:45:25,189 --> 01:45:28,776
Yeah. If you say so.

1226
01:45:34,324 --> 01:45:38,369
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt about it.

1227
01:45:39,412 --> 01:45:41,414
But if it was my money...

1228
01:45:42,373 --> 01:45:44,709
...I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.

1229
01:45:44,876 --> 01:45:47,045
What would your price be?

1230
01:45:47,211 --> 01:45:49,339
Well, if I was inclined to be generous...

1231
01:45:49,505 --> 01:45:53,217
...and I don't know why I would be inclined to be generous...

1232
01:45:53,801 --> 01:45:55,595
...9000.

1233
01:45:56,012 --> 01:45:57,055
Maybe.

1234
01:45:58,181 --> 01:45:59,223
Dr. Schultz...

1235
01:46:00,183 --> 01:46:04,187
...let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about.

1236
01:46:04,354 --> 01:46:06,732
It wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger.

1237
01:46:06,899 --> 01:46:07,942
Sure wasn't.

1238
01:46:08,108 --> 01:46:10,402
- You approached me to buy one. - Sure was.

1239
01:46:10,569 --> 01:46:12,988
That $9000 Bright Boy's been bandying about...

1240
01:46:13,155 --> 01:46:16,492
...ain't too far off. If I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that...

1241
01:46:16,659 --> 01:46:19,370
- ...I could do so any day of the week. - Any day.

1242
01:46:19,536 --> 01:46:23,874
But like you said in Greenville, doctor, I don't wanna sell him.

1243
01:46:24,208 --> 01:46:28,379
It was only your ridiculous offer of $12,000...

1244
01:46:28,545 --> 01:46:31,215
...that made me even consider it.

1245
01:46:39,556 --> 01:46:43,686
You know, Monsieur Candie, you do possess the power of persuasion.

1246
01:46:47,982 --> 01:46:50,150
Why not? Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.

1247
01:46:50,317 --> 01:46:52,444
Eskimo Joe, $12,000.

1248
01:46:52,611 --> 01:46:55,698
Hooray, doctor. Hooray. And a wise decision that is.

1249
01:46:55,864 --> 01:46:59,535
However, that is a tremendous amount of money.

1250
01:46:59,702 --> 01:47:02,746
And the way you have your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.

1251
01:47:02,913 --> 01:47:04,707
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1252
01:47:04,873 --> 01:47:08,043
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle to draw up a legal contract...

1253
01:47:08,210 --> 01:47:12,090
...before I'd feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh.

1254
01:47:12,257 --> 01:47:16,052
Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my choosing.

1255
01:47:16,219 --> 01:47:21,850
- Naturally. - So, say I return in about...

1256
01:47:23,977 --> 01:47:25,145
...five days' time.

1257
01:47:25,311 --> 01:47:26,438
Five days?

1258
01:47:26,604 --> 01:47:27,856
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1259
01:47:28,023 --> 01:47:30,316
And then my Mr. Tuttle and your Mr. Moguy...

1260
01:47:30,483 --> 01:47:33,236
...can hash out the finer details between themselves.

1261
01:47:33,987 --> 01:47:36,906
I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.

1262
01:47:37,657 --> 01:47:38,908
Gentlemen...

1263
01:47:39,951 --> 01:47:42,328
...may I propose a toast?

1264
01:47:44,205 --> 01:47:45,832
To Eskimo Joe.

1265
01:47:45,999 --> 01:47:50,003
Or shall we call him the Black Hercules?

1266
01:47:50,170 --> 01:47:52,088
To the Black Hercules.

1267
01:47:52,255 --> 01:47:53,840
The Black Hercules.

1268
01:47:54,007 --> 01:47:55,216
To the Black Hercules.

1269
01:47:55,383 --> 01:47:58,887
You was right, doctor. That name do have "pan-ass."

1270
01:48:00,972 --> 01:48:04,392
Hildi, top my drink off.

1271
01:48:07,187 --> 01:48:11,858
So, Hildi, how you like serving at the big table in the Big House, huh?

1272
01:48:12,317 --> 01:48:15,529
When Monsieur Candie talk to you, you answers.

1273
01:48:15,696 --> 01:48:17,865
I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.

1274
01:48:18,657 --> 01:48:21,786
Better than sizzling in that hot box or dragging your ass...

1275
01:48:21,952 --> 01:48:23,079
...through a bramble bush.

1276
01:48:23,245 --> 01:48:27,041
Maybe not as much fun as getting to pleasure all them Mandingos, huh?

1277
01:48:27,208 --> 01:48:29,585
- She like them niggers. Sure do. - Like Samson?

1278
01:48:29,752 --> 01:48:30,795
No, sir.

1279
01:48:30,961 --> 01:48:32,505
You know, Monsieur Candie...

1280
01:48:32,671 --> 01:48:36,383
...the doctor here might be interested in seeing Hildi's peeled back...

1281
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:39,929
...seeing as how they don't have many niggers where he come from.

1282
01:48:40,096 --> 01:48:42,431
Dr. Schultz, when you was alone with Hildi...

1283
01:48:42,598 --> 01:48:45,810
...did you just speak German or did you take her clothes off?

1284
01:48:45,976 --> 01:48:49,522
- No, we just talked and... - Oh, so you haven't seen her back?

1285
01:48:49,688 --> 01:48:50,731
I haven't...

1286
01:48:50,898 --> 01:48:54,068
No, no, no. Stephen's right, you might find this interesting.

1287
01:48:54,235 --> 01:48:55,653
Hildi, take off your dress.

1288
01:48:55,820 --> 01:48:57,822
Show Dr. Schultz your back here. Go on.

1289
01:48:57,988 --> 01:49:01,659
Calvin, I just got her all dressed up and looking nice.

1290
01:49:01,826 --> 01:49:04,787
But, Lara Lee, Dr. Schultz is from Düsseldorf.

1291
01:49:04,954 --> 01:49:07,790
They don't got niggers there. He is a man of medicine.

1292
01:49:07,957 --> 01:49:10,876
It would fascinate him, the niggers' endurance for pain.

1293
01:49:11,043 --> 01:49:14,380
These niggers are tough, Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1294
01:49:14,547 --> 01:49:16,590
Hildi's got something like four lashes.

1295
01:49:16,757 --> 01:49:19,427
Lara Lee just get one, she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1296
01:49:19,594 --> 01:49:22,053
Look at that, doctor. It's like a painting.

1297
01:49:22,065 --> 01:49:22,889
Calvin!

1298
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:26,977
We are eating. Ain't no one wanna look at her whipped-up back.

1299
01:49:28,603 --> 01:49:30,689
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.

1300
01:49:30,939 --> 01:49:33,984
After dinner, then, Stephen. After dinner.

1301
01:49:34,651 --> 01:49:36,653
During the brandies, gentlemen.

1302
01:49:42,659 --> 01:49:44,828
Cora, come get this girl.

1303
01:49:47,747 --> 01:49:50,709
- She a mess. - Yes, ma'am?

1304
01:49:51,084 --> 01:49:55,255
Why are you all undone? I just got you done up. Come on in here.

1305
01:50:01,469 --> 01:50:05,390
Baby, you on Stephen bad side, and you need to be on his blind side.

1306
01:50:05,557 --> 01:50:08,059
You say you ain't know him.

1307
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:15,692
I said, you said you ain't know him.

1308
01:50:16,735 --> 01:50:18,236
I don't.

1309
01:50:18,778 --> 01:50:20,363
Yes, you do.

1310
01:50:22,282 --> 01:50:23,534
Mr. Stephen...

1311
01:50:24,869 --> 01:50:25,995
...I don't.

1312
01:50:26,287 --> 01:50:28,956
Why is you lying to me?

1313
01:50:30,917 --> 01:50:32,335
I ain't.

1314
01:50:32,668 --> 01:50:34,921
Then why is you crying?

1315
01:50:35,504 --> 01:50:37,340
You scaring me.

1316
01:50:37,548 --> 01:50:38,758
Why is I'm scaring you?

1317
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:41,427
Because you scary.

1318
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:45,640
To speak German this afternoon with Hildi...

1319
01:50:45,806 --> 01:50:49,477
...was positively soul-enriching.

1320
01:50:49,685 --> 01:50:52,355
Doctor, that warms my heart to hear that.

1321
01:50:52,521 --> 01:50:55,775
You stay right here.

1322
01:51:00,905 --> 01:51:05,451
You indicated earlier you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1323
01:51:05,618 --> 01:51:08,704
Why, yes. Yes, sirree, Bob, I did.

1324
01:51:10,331 --> 01:51:12,208
In that case...

1325
01:51:12,375 --> 01:51:16,379
...allow me to propose another proposition.

1326
01:51:16,545 --> 01:51:17,672
I'm all ears.

1327
01:51:17,838 --> 01:51:19,924
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1328
01:51:20,299 --> 01:51:21,842
- Monsieur Candie... - Stephen.

1329
01:51:22,927 --> 01:51:25,805
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.

1330
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:31,478
I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz. My ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1331
01:51:31,645 --> 01:51:32,771
Excuse him.

1332
01:51:32,938 --> 01:51:36,441
Monsieur Candie, could I get a word with you in the kitchen?

1333
01:51:37,025 --> 01:51:38,902
You mean get up out of my chair?

1334
01:51:39,069 --> 01:51:41,071
If'n you could manage it.

1335
01:51:41,238 --> 01:51:44,241
- Why? - It's about dessert.

1336
01:51:44,408 --> 01:51:46,201
What about dessert?

1337
01:51:46,368 --> 01:51:48,954
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1338
01:51:49,121 --> 01:51:51,290
We're having white cake.

1339
01:51:51,456 --> 01:51:53,792
What sort of melodrama could be brewing?

1340
01:51:53,959 --> 01:51:58,297
You right, Monsieur Candie. You right. I'll handle it myself.

1341
01:51:58,463 --> 01:51:59,798
Meet me in the library.

1342
01:51:59,965 --> 01:52:03,343
I just can't understand why you won't come talk to these niggers.

1343
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:05,846
Shit get fucked up around here, you blame me.

1344
01:52:06,013 --> 01:52:10,642
Fine, fine. Friend Stephen, I will be along momentarily.

1345
01:52:10,809 --> 01:52:12,311
Yes, sir.

1346
01:52:12,853 --> 01:52:16,273
Well, gentlemen, as you can see...

1347
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:18,608
...talented as they are in the kitchen...

1348
01:52:18,775 --> 01:52:22,362
...from time to time, adult supervision is required.

1349
01:52:25,198 --> 01:52:27,492
If you'll excuse me a moment...

1350
01:52:33,082 --> 01:52:35,126
You may clear the dinner service.

1351
01:52:36,377 --> 01:52:38,338
You heard him. Go on, get.

1352
01:52:39,213 --> 01:52:40,256
Hurry up, girl.

1353
01:52:40,423 --> 01:52:45,511
So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you regale us with a tale of the circus?

1354
01:52:45,678 --> 01:52:48,348
- The circus? - Yes.

1355
01:52:54,729 --> 01:52:56,731
What is the matter?

1356
01:53:01,819 --> 01:53:06,908
Them motherfuckers ain't here to buy no Mandingos.

1357
01:53:07,075 --> 01:53:08,618
They wants that girl.

1358
01:53:10,703 --> 01:53:13,414
Stephen, what the hell are you talking about?

1359
01:53:13,581 --> 01:53:16,918
They playing your ass for a fool is what I'm talking about.

1360
01:53:17,251 --> 01:53:20,755
They ain't here for no muscle-bound Jimmie.

1361
01:53:21,339 --> 01:53:23,424
They here for that girl.

1362
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:25,885
What girl? What, Hildi?

1363
01:53:26,052 --> 01:53:29,680
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django, them niggers know each other.

1364
01:53:31,349 --> 01:53:32,934
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

1365
01:53:33,101 --> 01:53:35,561
- Did he give you any money? - No, not yet, but...

1366
01:53:35,728 --> 01:53:38,107
Then he ain't bought diddly. Not yet, no how.

1367
01:53:38,273 --> 01:53:40,567
But he's just about to buy...

1368
01:53:40,734 --> 01:53:43,862
...who he come here to buy when I interrupted him.

1369
01:53:44,029 --> 01:53:47,658
"Thank you, Stephen." You're welcome, Calvin.

1370
01:53:52,371 --> 01:53:54,915
Where you getting all this?

1371
01:53:55,582 --> 01:53:59,378
Why would they go through all that for a nigger with a chewed-up back...

1372
01:53:59,545 --> 01:54:00,671
...ain't worth $300?

1373
01:54:00,838 --> 01:54:04,466
They doing it because that nigger Django's in love with Hildi.

1374
01:54:04,633 --> 01:54:05,801
She probably his wife.

1375
01:54:06,635 --> 01:54:10,722
Why that German gives a fuck who that uppity son of a bitch is in love with...

1376
01:54:10,889 --> 01:54:13,058
...I'm sure I don't know.

1377
01:54:15,436 --> 01:54:17,479
If she's who they want...

1378
01:54:17,813 --> 01:54:22,109
...why this whole snake oil pitch about Mandingos then?

1379
01:54:22,276 --> 01:54:25,821
You wouldn't pay no never mind to no $300.

1380
01:54:26,029 --> 01:54:28,323
But that 12,000?

1381
01:54:28,907 --> 01:54:31,827
That made you real friendly, now, didn't it?

1382
01:54:34,079 --> 01:54:36,290
Yes, it did.

1383
01:54:39,126 --> 01:54:41,128
His wife, huh?

1384
01:54:44,674 --> 01:54:48,970
If it had been a snake, it would have bit me.

1385
01:54:51,723 --> 01:54:54,309
Those lying...

1386
01:54:54,601 --> 01:54:57,937
...goddamn time-wasting...

1387
01:54:58,104 --> 01:55:00,982
...sons of bitches.

1388
01:55:02,609 --> 01:55:03,985
Sons of bitches!

1389
01:55:04,152 --> 01:55:09,991
- -Out of New Orleans, so I have quite a bit of practice with theatre types.

1390
01:55:10,575 --> 01:55:11,993
Oh, there you are.

1391
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:15,830
I was beginning to think that you and that old crow run off together.

1392
01:55:16,831 --> 01:55:19,083
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1393
01:55:19,542 --> 01:55:22,170
Lara Lee, I was just looking out the big window.

1394
01:55:22,337 --> 01:55:25,340
Billy Crash is out there dealing with some shady slaver...

1395
01:55:25,507 --> 01:55:30,553
...trying to sell a passel of ponies. Be a dear, go give them gals an eyeball.

1396
01:55:30,845 --> 01:55:33,640
- Of course, brother. - Thank you, darling.

1397
01:55:46,444 --> 01:55:49,907
Yeah. Business never sleeps.

1398
01:55:51,992 --> 01:55:54,870
Apropos, before your exit...

1399
01:55:55,037 --> 01:55:59,333
...we were discussing the possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1400
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:02,336
Yes. Yes, we were, doctor.

1401
01:56:02,503 --> 01:56:04,672
And we will again, in a moment.

1402
01:56:20,938 --> 01:56:23,357
Who's your little friend?

1403
01:56:28,153 --> 01:56:29,947
This is Ben.

1404
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:35,911
He's a old Joe that lived around here for a long time.

1405
01:56:36,161 --> 01:56:38,622
And I do mean a long damn time.

1406
01:56:39,748 --> 01:56:43,877
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...

1407
01:56:44,169 --> 01:56:46,338
...and my daddy's daddy.

1408
01:56:46,505 --> 01:56:49,341
Till he up and keeled over one day...

1409
01:56:51,886 --> 01:56:54,139
...Old Ben took care of me.

1410
01:56:56,016 --> 01:57:00,103
Growing up the son of a huge plantation owner in Mississippi...

1411
01:57:00,270 --> 01:57:02,105
...puts a white man in contact...

1412
01:57:02,272 --> 01:57:05,942
...with a whole lot of black faces.

1413
01:57:07,694 --> 01:57:13,116
I spent my whole life here, right here in Candyland...

1414
01:57:14,284 --> 01:57:18,038
...surrounded by black faces.

1415
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:23,501
Now, seeing them every day, day in, day out...

1416
01:57:23,668 --> 01:57:26,129
...I only had one question:

1417
01:57:29,341 --> 01:57:30,717
Why don't they kill us?

1418
01:57:34,929 --> 01:57:40,018
Now, right out there on that porch, three times a week for 50 years...

1419
01:57:40,185 --> 01:57:45,190
...Old Ben here would shave my daddy with a straight razor.

1420
01:57:45,565 --> 01:57:50,487
Now, if I was Old Ben, I would have cut my daddy's goddamn throat...

1421
01:57:50,654 --> 01:57:54,532
...and it wouldn't have taken me no 50 years to do it, neither.

1422
01:57:56,619 --> 01:57:58,537
But he never did.

1423
01:58:00,039 --> 01:58:01,165
Why not?

1424
01:58:02,667 --> 01:58:07,088
You see, the science of phrenology...

1425
01:58:07,630 --> 01:58:09,799
...is crucial to understanding...

1426
01:58:09,965 --> 01:58:13,219
...the separation of our two species.

1427
01:58:14,553 --> 01:58:17,515
In the skull of the African here...

1428
01:58:18,307 --> 01:58:20,851
...the area associated with submissiveness...

1429
01:58:21,018 --> 01:58:26,816
...is larger than any human or any other subhuman species on planet Earth.

1430
01:58:41,747 --> 01:58:43,958
If you examine...

1431
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,753
...this piece of skull here...

1432
01:58:53,467 --> 01:58:57,054
...you will notice three distinct dimples.

1433
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:04,479
Here, here and here.

1434
01:59:04,646 --> 01:59:05,856
Now...

1435
01:59:06,022 --> 01:59:10,902
...if I was holding the skull of an Isaac Newton or Galileo...

1436
01:59:11,069 --> 01:59:15,490
...these three dimples would be found in the area most associated with...

1437
01:59:15,657 --> 01:59:17,451
...creativity.

1438
01:59:17,617 --> 01:59:20,120
But this is the skull of Old Ben.

1439
01:59:20,370 --> 01:59:22,247
And in the skull of Old Ben...

1440
01:59:22,414 --> 01:59:24,708
...unburdened by genius...

1441
01:59:24,875 --> 01:59:29,713
...these three dimples exist in the area of the skull most associated with...

1442
01:59:30,172 --> 01:59:31,882
...servility.

1443
01:59:32,716 --> 01:59:34,718
Now, Bright Boy...

1444
01:59:35,177 --> 01:59:37,554
...I will admit you are pretty clever.

1445
01:59:39,890 --> 01:59:42,601
But if I took this hammer here...

1446
01:59:44,144 --> 01:59:47,063
...and I bashed in your skull with it...

1447
01:59:47,522 --> 01:59:53,320
...you would have the same three dimples in the same place...

1448
01:59:54,070 --> 01:59:55,614
...as Old Ben.

1449
01:59:56,740 --> 02:00:00,202
Hey! Now lay your palms flat on that tabletop!

1450
02:00:00,368 --> 02:00:03,371
If you lift those palms off that turtle shell tabletop...

1451
02:00:03,538 --> 02:00:07,126
...Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1452
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:11,339
There have been a lot of lies around this dinner table tonight...

1453
02:00:11,506 --> 02:00:13,633
...but that you can believe!

1454
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:19,263
Mr. Moguy, would you collect the pistol hanging off these boys' hips here?

1455
02:00:23,684 --> 02:00:26,896
- Thank you ever so much. - Doctor.

1456
02:00:30,733 --> 02:00:32,610
Where were we?

1457
02:00:36,572 --> 02:00:38,533
Jackass.

1458
02:00:41,869 --> 02:00:43,496
Yes.

1459
02:00:43,663 --> 02:00:47,208
I do believe you were just getting ready to make me a proposition...

1460
02:00:47,375 --> 02:00:49,043
...to buy Broomhilda.

1461
02:00:49,210 --> 02:00:50,837
Am I right?

1462
02:00:54,632 --> 02:00:56,217
Right.

1463
02:00:58,052 --> 02:00:59,095
Bring out Hildi!

1464
02:01:02,765 --> 02:01:04,642
Get over there yonder.

1465
02:01:05,518 --> 02:01:07,895
Sit your ass in that goddamn chair!

1466
02:01:08,062 --> 02:01:11,567
- Lay your hand flat on that tabletop. - Now shut your mouth.

1467
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:16,572
Dr. Schultz...

1468
02:01:16,738 --> 02:01:20,617
...in Greenville, you yourself said that for the right nigger...

1469
02:01:20,784 --> 02:01:25,289
...you'd be willing to pay what some may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1470
02:01:25,455 --> 02:01:28,834
To which me myself said, "What is your definition of ridiculous?"

1471
02:01:29,001 --> 02:01:33,171
To which you said, "$12,000."

1472
02:01:33,463 --> 02:01:37,134
Now, considering y'all have ridden a whole lot of miles...

1473
02:01:37,301 --> 02:01:39,469
...went through a whole lot of trouble...

1474
02:01:39,636 --> 02:01:43,932
...and done spread a whole lot of bull to purchase this lovely lady right here...

1475
02:01:44,099 --> 02:01:50,105
...it would appear that Broomhilda is, in fact, the right nigger.

1476
02:01:50,355 --> 02:01:54,067
And if y'all want to leave Candyland with Broomhilda...

1477
02:01:54,276 --> 02:01:59,781
...the price is $12,000.

1478
02:01:59,948 --> 02:02:03,744
And I take it you prefer the "take it or leave it" style of negotiation?

1479
02:02:05,996 --> 02:02:08,206
Yes, I do, doctor.

1480
02:02:08,373 --> 02:02:11,293
You see, under the laws of Chickasaw County...

1481
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:14,964
...Broomhilda here is my property.

1482
02:02:15,131 --> 02:02:20,386
And I can choose to do with my property whatever I so desire.

1483
02:02:21,512 --> 02:02:24,349
And if y'all think my price...

1484
02:02:24,515 --> 02:02:28,102
...for this nigger here is too steep...

1485
02:02:28,269 --> 02:02:31,147
...what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1486
02:02:34,484 --> 02:02:37,987
...take this goddamn hammer here and beat her ass to death with it!

1487
02:02:38,154 --> 02:02:39,656
Right in front of both y'all!

1488
02:02:39,822 --> 02:02:40,949
Easy, big fella.

1489
02:02:41,115 --> 02:02:44,911
Then we can examine the three dimples inside Broomhilda's skull!

1490
02:02:45,078 --> 02:02:48,581
Now, what's it gonna be, doc?

1491
02:02:49,707 --> 02:02:50,917
What's it gonna be?

1492
02:02:51,084 --> 02:02:55,046
May I lift the hands off the tabletop in order to remove my billfold?

1493
02:02:55,922 --> 02:02:57,757
Yes, you may.

1494
02:03:10,937 --> 02:03:12,230
That 12.

1495
02:03:16,234 --> 02:03:18,194
Sold!

1496
02:03:18,403 --> 02:03:24,868
To the man with the exceptional beard and his unexceptional nigger.

1497
02:03:30,124 --> 02:03:32,626
- Mr. Moguy. - Yes, Calvin?

1498
02:03:33,168 --> 02:03:36,422
Will you make these gentlemen a receipt for $12,000, please?

1499
02:03:36,588 --> 02:03:39,008
Twelve thousand dollars.

1500
02:03:41,427 --> 02:03:44,263
It was a pleasure doing business with y'all.

1501
02:03:44,430 --> 02:03:46,140
Now, gentlemen...

1502
02:03:47,266 --> 02:03:49,768
...if you care to join me in the parlour...

1503
02:03:50,310 --> 02:03:53,230
...we will be serving white cake.

1504
02:05:20,944 --> 02:05:22,862
Well done, Calvin.

1505
02:05:24,823 --> 02:05:26,157
Excuse me.

1506
02:05:26,324 --> 02:05:27,826
Excuse me, ma'am.

1507
02:05:29,078 --> 02:05:31,247
Could you please stop playing Beethoven?

1508
02:05:31,622 --> 02:05:33,791
Take your hands off the harp.

1509
02:05:37,086 --> 02:05:38,295
Doctor.

1510
02:05:38,754 --> 02:05:41,340
- Doctor, you can't go in there. - Stephen, Stephen.

1511
02:05:41,507 --> 02:05:44,260
- He ain't got no business going in there. - Let it be.

1512
02:05:44,426 --> 02:05:47,930
He's just a little upset, that's all. I'll handle this.

1513
02:06:13,455 --> 02:06:14,665
White cake?

1514
02:06:15,624 --> 02:06:18,252
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1515
02:06:27,761 --> 02:06:31,056
You brooding about me getting the best of you, huh?

1516
02:06:31,265 --> 02:06:36,188
Actually, I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1517
02:06:36,354 --> 02:06:38,440
D'Artagnan.

1518
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:42,485
And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this.

1519
02:06:42,903 --> 02:06:44,237
Come again?

1520
02:06:47,490 --> 02:06:51,536
Alexandre Dumas. He wrote The Three Musketeers.

1521
02:06:51,703 --> 02:06:53,246
Yes, of course, doctor.

1522
02:06:53,413 --> 02:06:55,165
I figured you must be an admirer.

1523
02:06:55,332 --> 02:06:59,628
You named your slave after his novel's lead character.

1524
02:06:59,836 --> 02:07:03,215
Now, if Alexandre Dumas had been there today...

1525
02:07:03,381 --> 02:07:05,550
...I wonder what he would have made of it.

1526
02:07:07,761 --> 02:07:09,429
You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1527
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:16,811
Yes. His approval would be a dubious proposition at best.

1528
02:07:19,147 --> 02:07:21,316
Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1529
02:07:22,817 --> 02:07:25,195
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1530
02:07:28,823 --> 02:07:31,701
- Are these Broomhilda's papers? - Yes, they are.

1531
02:07:31,868 --> 02:07:33,536
- May I? - Of course.

1532
02:07:33,703 --> 02:07:35,163
Thank you.

1533
02:07:37,250 --> 02:07:39,961
That is her bill of sale, her ownership history...

1534
02:07:40,127 --> 02:07:42,505
...and of course, her freedom papers, doctor.

1535
02:07:42,672 --> 02:07:44,799
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1536
02:07:46,050 --> 02:07:49,387
- Right over there on that little table. - Thank you.

1537
02:08:10,449 --> 02:08:11,534
Thank you.

1538
02:08:15,121 --> 02:08:17,832
Broomhilda Von Shaft...

1539
02:08:19,542 --> 02:08:22,253
...consider yourself a free woman.

1540
02:08:33,931 --> 02:08:36,183
Mr. Candie...

1541
02:08:37,727 --> 02:08:41,605
...normally, I would say auf Wiedersehen.

1542
02:08:41,772 --> 02:08:46,403
But since what auf Wiedersehen actually means is "till I see you again"...

1543
02:08:46,570 --> 02:08:50,449
...and since I never wish to see you again, to you, sir...

1544
02:08:50,615 --> 02:08:53,952
...I say, "goodbye."

1545
02:08:57,456 --> 02:08:58,915
Let's go.

1546
02:09:00,042 --> 02:09:01,460
Come on.

1547
02:09:03,295 --> 02:09:05,130
One more moment, doctor.

1548
02:09:07,007 --> 02:09:08,050
What?

1549
02:09:12,763 --> 02:09:15,307
It's a custom here in the South...

1550
02:09:15,474 --> 02:09:21,271
...once a business deal is concluded that the two parties shake hands.

1551
02:09:21,688 --> 02:09:24,858
- It implies good faith. - I'm not from the South.

1552
02:09:25,025 --> 02:09:26,735
But you are...

1553
02:09:27,110 --> 02:09:29,446
...in my house, doctor.

1554
02:09:30,197 --> 02:09:31,907
So I'm afraid I must insist.

1555
02:09:32,074 --> 02:09:33,116
Insist?

1556
02:09:33,283 --> 02:09:35,410
On what? That I shake your hand?

1557
02:09:35,577 --> 02:09:38,747
Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction.

1558
02:09:39,414 --> 02:09:44,336
- You know what I think you are? - What you think I am? No, I don't.

1559
02:09:45,796 --> 02:09:47,799
I think you are a bad loser.

1560
02:09:48,299 --> 02:09:51,386
And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1561
02:09:51,552 --> 02:09:52,762
Nevertheless...

1562
02:09:53,388 --> 02:09:56,557
...here in Chickasaw County, a deal ain't done...

1563
02:09:56,724 --> 02:09:59,102
...until the two parties have shook hands.

1564
02:09:59,811 --> 02:10:03,481
Even after all that paper signing, don't mean shit...

1565
02:10:03,815 --> 02:10:07,402
...you don't shake my hand.

1566
02:10:08,152 --> 02:10:14,033
If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw away $12,000?

1567
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:15,868
I don't think so.

1568
02:10:16,994 --> 02:10:18,037
Mr. Pooch?

1569
02:10:20,039 --> 02:10:24,669
If she tries to leave here before this nigger-loving German shakes my hand...

1570
02:10:24,836 --> 02:10:26,504
...you cut her ass down.

1571
02:10:48,484 --> 02:10:51,822
You really want me to shake your hand?

1572
02:10:53,449 --> 02:10:55,117
I insist.

1573
02:10:56,326 --> 02:10:58,704
If you insist.

1574
02:11:15,512 --> 02:11:18,432
No! Calvin!

1575
02:11:19,641 --> 02:11:21,226
Calvin!

1576
02:11:27,441 --> 02:11:29,985
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1577
02:11:42,372 --> 02:11:44,500
Nigger's gone crazy! Help!

1578
02:11:44,666 --> 02:11:47,211
Help, he's killing everyone!

1579
02:12:03,269 --> 02:12:05,230
- Holy...! - Shit!

1580
02:12:05,396 --> 02:12:06,439
- Son of a...! - Bitch!

1581
02:12:11,069 --> 02:12:12,403
- Damn it! - Fucking...!

1582
02:12:12,737 --> 02:12:13,863
Get the fuck...!

1583
02:12:16,908 --> 02:12:18,910
Damn it, son of a bitch! What...?

1584
02:12:19,702 --> 02:12:20,995
Fucking nigger!

1585
02:12:21,162 --> 02:12:22,330
Damn it!

1586
02:12:23,206 --> 02:12:25,500
What the fuck is going on?

1587
02:12:26,125 --> 02:12:27,627
You shot me!

1588
02:12:27,794 --> 02:12:29,295
You stupid son of a...!

1589
02:12:29,462 --> 02:12:30,880
Sorry, Jessie!

1590
02:12:31,047 --> 02:12:35,134
Who the fuck gave a nigger a goddamn gun?

1591
02:13:05,082 --> 02:13:06,250
Aim low!

1592
02:13:09,211 --> 02:13:10,671
Nigger! Gonna kill!

1593
02:13:11,964 --> 02:13:13,632
God! Oh, my God!

1594
02:13:14,758 --> 02:13:16,468
Motherfucker!

1595
02:13:24,518 --> 02:13:25,978
Shit!

1596
02:14:22,702 --> 02:14:23,828
Shit.

1597
02:14:36,007 --> 02:14:37,467
Hold your fire!

1598
02:14:40,845 --> 02:14:42,681
Hold your fire!

1599
02:14:44,265 --> 02:14:46,017
Stop shooting, goddamn it!

1600
02:14:54,734 --> 02:14:56,277
Django!

1601
02:14:56,611 --> 02:14:57,654
What?

1602
02:15:00,740 --> 02:15:02,575
We got your woman.

1603
02:15:03,827 --> 02:15:07,163
Billy Crash here got his pistol upside her head.

1604
02:15:07,330 --> 02:15:12,420
You don't stop all that carrying on, he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.

1605
02:15:12,586 --> 02:15:14,630
Now, that ain't no threat, horse boy.

1606
02:15:14,964 --> 02:15:16,465
That there is a promise.

1607
02:15:17,925 --> 02:15:19,343
Or...

1608
02:15:19,510 --> 02:15:22,430
...you can give up, throw your gun out...

1609
02:15:23,431 --> 02:15:24,765
...we won't kill Hildi.

1610
02:15:24,932 --> 02:15:26,308
Horseshit!

1611
02:15:26,475 --> 02:15:29,895
Honest In jun, Django. I swear 'fore God.

1612
02:15:30,646 --> 02:15:32,314
You give up...

1613
02:15:32,606 --> 02:15:35,735
...ain't no harm gonna come to her.

1614
02:15:36,777 --> 02:15:39,029
And I'm supposed to believe your black ass?

1615
02:15:39,196 --> 02:15:42,199
I don't give a goddamn what you believe or don't believe!

1616
02:15:42,366 --> 02:15:45,327
I believe if you don't give up in the next 10 seconds...

1617
02:15:45,494 --> 02:15:49,331
...we gonna blow this bitch's brains out! Believe that!

1618
02:15:51,709 --> 02:15:53,127
Don't do it.

1619
02:15:53,669 --> 02:15:55,212
You give me up.

1620
02:15:55,629 --> 02:15:57,465
- Six! - Just let me go.

1621
02:15:57,631 --> 02:15:59,049
- Seven! - They got too much.

1622
02:15:59,216 --> 02:16:00,760
- Django. - Eight!

1623
02:16:00,926 --> 02:16:01,969
I love you.

1624
02:16:02,386 --> 02:16:03,429
Nine!

1625
02:16:03,596 --> 02:16:04,597
Hold it!

1626
02:16:04,764 --> 02:16:05,806
No.

1627
02:16:07,683 --> 02:16:08,809
I give up.

1628
02:16:09,977 --> 02:16:12,730
I can't hear you, nigger.

1629
02:16:12,980 --> 02:16:15,442
I said I give up.

1630
02:16:39,382 --> 02:16:42,344
No.

1631
02:16:42,511 --> 02:16:44,012
No.

1632
02:18:15,396 --> 02:18:17,773
Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.

1633
02:18:22,737 --> 02:18:25,324
So y'all bounty hunters, huh?

1634
02:18:25,908 --> 02:18:29,036
I knew there was something fishy about y'all.

1635
02:18:29,620 --> 02:18:32,164
We found your wanted posters...

1636
02:18:32,331 --> 02:18:35,167
...and book of figures in your saddlebags.

1637
02:18:36,126 --> 02:18:38,128
I got to say...

1638
02:18:38,670 --> 02:18:41,882
...I ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before.

1639
02:18:42,049 --> 02:18:45,886
Black boy paid to kill white men? How'd you like that line of work?

1640
02:18:46,053 --> 02:18:48,847
Probably pretty good while it lasted, huh?

1641
02:18:58,231 --> 02:19:01,652
Time to say good night to them nuts, blackie. On three.

1642
02:19:02,194 --> 02:19:03,487
One.

1643
02:19:04,321 --> 02:19:05,948
I got you. Two.

1644
02:19:07,407 --> 02:19:09,326
Calm down. Now here it comes.

1645
02:19:10,410 --> 02:19:11,828
Captain?

1646
02:19:12,079 --> 02:19:13,872
Miss Lara want to see you.

1647
02:19:14,581 --> 02:19:18,543
Something to do with the Old Man's funeral.

1648
02:19:18,919 --> 02:19:22,673
Oh, and she changed her mind about snipping Django.

1649
02:19:23,507 --> 02:19:26,343
She gonna give him to the LeQuint Dickey people.

1650
02:19:28,096 --> 02:19:30,306
Well, she didn't waste a minute telling me.

1651
02:19:37,397 --> 02:19:39,732
How disappointing.

1652
02:20:02,255 --> 02:20:04,007
You leaving.

1653
02:20:05,341 --> 02:20:08,928
This here what you take with you.

1654
02:20:11,723 --> 02:20:15,268
Your black ass has been all them motherfuckers at the Big House...

1655
02:20:15,435 --> 02:20:18,730
...could talk about for the last few hours.

1656
02:20:18,896 --> 02:20:22,400
Seem like white folk ain't never had a bright idea in they life...

1657
02:20:22,567 --> 02:20:25,570
...was coming up with all kinds of ways to kill your ass.

1658
02:20:25,737 --> 02:20:30,950
Now, mind you, most of them ideas had to do with fucking with your fun parts.

1659
02:20:31,117 --> 02:20:34,830
Now, that may seem like a good idea...

1660
02:20:34,997 --> 02:20:37,082
...but truth is...

1661
02:20:38,167 --> 02:20:40,669
...when you snip a nigger's nuts...

1662
02:20:40,836 --> 02:20:44,965
...most of them bleed out in, oh, about seven minutes.

1663
02:20:45,132 --> 02:20:46,800
Most of them.

1664
02:20:48,510 --> 02:20:50,471
More than most.

1665
02:20:50,637 --> 02:20:52,389
Then I says:

1666
02:20:53,891 --> 02:20:56,101
"Shitfire.

1667
02:20:56,685 --> 02:21:01,231
The niggers we sells to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."

1668
02:21:01,690 --> 02:21:04,401
And they still saying, "Let's whip him to death."

1669
02:21:04,568 --> 02:21:08,030
Or "Throw him to the Mandingos." "Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."

1670
02:21:08,197 --> 02:21:11,492
And I said, "What's so special about that?

1671
02:21:11,658 --> 02:21:13,577
We do that shit all the time.

1672
02:21:13,744 --> 02:21:14,787
Hell's bells...

1673
02:21:14,953 --> 02:21:19,875
...the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."

1674
02:21:20,793 --> 02:21:23,629
Lo and behold...

1675
02:21:23,796 --> 02:21:28,383
...out of nowhere, Miss Lara come up with the bright idea...

1676
02:21:28,592 --> 02:21:32,304
...of giving your ass to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

1677
02:21:34,681 --> 02:21:39,312
And as a slave of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company...

1678
02:21:39,771 --> 02:21:43,316
...henceforth, till the day you die...

1679
02:21:43,525 --> 02:21:46,569
...all day, every day...

1680
02:21:46,736 --> 02:21:49,614
...you will be swinging a sledgehammer...

1681
02:21:49,781 --> 02:21:54,285
...turning big rocks into little rocks.

1682
02:21:54,869 --> 02:21:56,371
Now, when you get there...

1683
02:21:56,538 --> 02:21:59,124
...they gonna take away your name...

1684
02:21:59,290 --> 02:22:02,418
...give you a number and a sledgehammer...

1685
02:22:02,585 --> 02:22:04,796
...and say, "Get to work."

1686
02:22:04,963 --> 02:22:07,507
And one word of sass, they cuts out your tongue.

1687
02:22:07,674 --> 02:22:10,135
And they good at it too. You won't bleed out.

1688
02:22:10,301 --> 02:22:13,721
Oh, they does that real good.

1689
02:22:13,888 --> 02:22:15,473
They gonna work you...

1690
02:22:15,640 --> 02:22:20,645
...all day, every day, till your back give out.

1691
02:22:20,854 --> 02:22:23,690
Then they're gonna hit you in the head with a hammer...

1692
02:22:23,857 --> 02:22:25,942
...throw your ass down the nigger hole.

1693
02:22:26,109 --> 02:22:31,990
And that will be the story of you, Django.

1694
02:23:10,196 --> 02:23:12,281
And what's the golden rule, Frankie, eh?

1695
02:23:13,073 --> 02:23:15,576
You don't root abos.

1696
02:23:20,247 --> 02:23:21,749
Hey, white boy.

1697
02:23:23,209 --> 02:23:25,169
I said, hey, white boy.

1698
02:23:25,586 --> 02:23:28,672
Shut up, black. You ain't got nothing to say I wanna hear.

1699
02:23:28,839 --> 02:23:31,091
How'd you like to make $11,000?

1700
02:23:31,258 --> 02:23:32,343
Do what, now?

1701
02:23:32,509 --> 02:23:36,055
I said how'd you like to make $11,000?

1702
02:23:36,388 --> 02:23:40,559
- Eleven thousand, 500, actually. - What the fuck are you talking about?

1703
02:23:40,726 --> 02:23:45,439
Back there at that plantation, Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune.

1704
02:23:45,606 --> 02:23:48,276
Just sitting there. And y'all rode right past it.

1705
02:23:48,860 --> 02:23:51,029
You be damned, blackie, we're not bandits.

1706
02:23:51,196 --> 02:23:55,450
I ain't saying that. Nice thing about this fortune is it ain't illegal.

1707
02:23:55,617 --> 02:23:58,745
You can't steal it. You got to earn it, white boy.

1708
02:23:59,746 --> 02:24:01,957
You got something to say, mate, you say it.

1709
02:24:02,123 --> 02:24:05,043
The $11,500 fortune waiting for you back at Candyland...

1710
02:24:05,210 --> 02:24:08,046
...is in the form of a "wanted dead or alive" bounty...

1711
02:24:08,213 --> 02:24:12,050
- ...on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang. - Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

1712
02:24:12,217 --> 02:24:16,846
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this gang of stagecoach robbers, the Bacall Gang.

1713
02:24:17,013 --> 02:24:20,225
There's a $7000 "wanted dead or alive" bounty on him...

1714
02:24:20,392 --> 02:24:22,978
...$1500 for each of his three accomplices:

1715
02:24:23,853 --> 02:24:25,355
Dandy Michaels...

1716
02:24:25,730 --> 02:24:29,818
...Gerald Nash and Crazy Craig Koons.

1717
02:24:30,026 --> 02:24:31,528
All four of them gentlemen...

1718
02:24:31,695 --> 02:24:35,323
...they back there at Candyland laughing their ass off. You know why?

1719
02:24:35,490 --> 02:24:39,327
Because they just got away with murder. But it ain't got to be that way.

1720
02:24:39,494 --> 02:24:42,956
You and your mates, y'all can ride back there and get that money.

1721
02:24:43,123 --> 02:24:47,669
- What'd these jokers do again? - Sons of bitches killed innocent people.

1722
02:24:47,877 --> 02:24:51,048
Stagecoach robbery. Innocent white people.

1723
02:24:52,174 --> 02:24:55,553
I got the handbill right here in my pocket, if you let me get it.

1724
02:24:55,720 --> 02:24:57,054
Get it out.

1725
02:24:58,514 --> 02:25:01,434
"Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall...

1726
02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:04,353
- ...and the Smitty Bacall Gang. - But you're a slave.

1727
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:07,732
- Murder and stagecoach robbery." - I ain't no goddamn slave.

1728
02:25:07,898 --> 02:25:09,567
Do I sound like a fucking slave?

1729
02:25:09,734 --> 02:25:12,194
- "$7000 for Smitty Bacall." - That's a shitload.

1730
02:25:12,361 --> 02:25:14,030
I'm a bounty hunter.

1731
02:25:15,197 --> 02:25:17,908
Yesterday, as a free man...

1732
02:25:18,075 --> 02:25:22,705
...I rode into Candyland on a horse with my German white partner...

1733
02:25:22,872 --> 02:25:24,415
...Dr. King Schultz.

1734
02:25:24,582 --> 02:25:29,378
We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way from Texas to Chickasaw County.

1735
02:25:29,545 --> 02:25:32,340
We finally found their ass laying low in Candyland.

1736
02:25:32,506 --> 02:25:35,926
We went in there to get them, things went sour...

1737
02:25:36,093 --> 02:25:39,472
...my partner got killed, Calvin Candie got shot...

1738
02:25:39,638 --> 02:25:42,266
...then everybody there decided to blame me...

1739
02:25:42,433 --> 02:25:44,060
...so here I am.

1740
02:25:45,728 --> 02:25:47,855
But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.

1741
02:25:48,022 --> 02:25:50,858
And all y'all know I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

1742
02:25:51,025 --> 02:25:54,278
But them four men is still back there, they're still wanted...

1743
02:25:54,445 --> 02:25:56,281
...and that 11,500 is up for grabs.

1744
02:25:56,448 --> 02:26:00,327
The last thing they'd expect is y'all riding back in there and getting it.

1745
02:26:00,494 --> 02:26:02,120
Well, what's the deal?

1746
02:26:02,287 --> 02:26:05,791
You tell us who they are and we turn you loose?

1747
02:26:05,957 --> 02:26:08,668
No, no, no. I ain't gonna tell you who they are.

1748
02:26:08,877 --> 02:26:12,255
But you give me a pistol, one of them horses...

1749
02:26:12,422 --> 02:26:17,094
...and $500 of that 11,500, and I'll point them out to you.

1750
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:18,595
This is a real handbill.

1751
02:26:18,762 --> 02:26:22,933
Just because it's a real handbill doesn't mean that other bunch of malarkey is.

1752
02:26:23,100 --> 02:26:24,893
Now, why would a slave...

1753
02:26:25,060 --> 02:26:28,772
...have a "wanted dead or alive" handbill in his pocket?

1754
02:26:33,276 --> 02:26:36,154
Did that black ride into Candyland yesterday?

1755
02:26:42,494 --> 02:26:46,790
All right, I'm gonna ask you again.

1756
02:26:47,666 --> 02:26:50,794
I want you to remember, I don't like liars.

1757
02:26:51,002 --> 02:26:52,712
Is he a Candyland slave...

1758
02:26:52,879 --> 02:26:56,716
...or did he ride in with a white man on a horse yesterday?

1759
02:26:56,883 --> 02:26:58,552
Yeah.

1760
02:26:58,885 --> 02:27:01,222
They walked us from the Greenville auction...

1761
02:27:01,389 --> 02:27:03,975
...and he rode in on a horse with a white man.

1762
02:27:04,142 --> 02:27:08,271
Now, this white man, was the black his slave?

1763
02:27:08,438 --> 02:27:09,981
He weren't no slave.

1764
02:27:10,148 --> 02:27:12,191
You fucking sure about that?

1765
02:27:12,358 --> 02:27:13,860
Damn sure.

1766
02:27:17,822 --> 02:27:19,740
What happened over in Candyland?

1767
02:27:19,907 --> 02:27:23,286
Bunch of shooting. Master got shot.

1768
02:27:23,453 --> 02:27:25,496
- Who shot him? - The German.

1769
02:27:25,663 --> 02:27:26,914
Why'd he do that?

1770
02:27:27,373 --> 02:27:31,169
Nigger and the German was acting like they were slavers but they wasn't.

1771
02:27:31,335 --> 02:27:34,172
- Well, what were they? - Bounty hunters.

1772
02:27:35,381 --> 02:27:38,634
Fuck me, Roy. I mean, this could be big, mate.

1773
02:27:39,594 --> 02:27:42,847
Well, smoke, you got a deal.

1774
02:27:44,432 --> 02:27:46,225
I got one more condition.

1775
02:27:46,392 --> 02:27:47,435
What's that?

1776
02:27:47,602 --> 02:27:50,646
When we get there, when time come...

1777
02:27:52,607 --> 02:27:55,318
- ...you let me help you kill them. - Hey.

1778
02:27:55,693 --> 02:27:57,278
You're a funny bugger.

1779
02:27:57,445 --> 02:28:00,031
- Cut him loose. - Yeah, yeah.

1780
02:28:00,239 --> 02:28:02,158
You got yourself a deal, blackie.

1781
02:28:02,325 --> 02:28:04,076
You got yourself a deal, mate.

1782
02:28:04,243 --> 02:28:05,496
Hey.

1783
02:28:06,038 --> 02:28:09,124
You're all right for a black fella. Oh, yeah.

1784
02:28:14,213 --> 02:28:15,964
There we go. There you go, mate.

1785
02:28:16,131 --> 02:28:17,466
Yeah.

1786
02:28:17,633 --> 02:28:20,260
We're gonna give you that packhorse over there.

1787
02:28:20,427 --> 02:28:23,305
- What them saddlebags got in them? - Dynamite.

1788
02:28:23,472 --> 02:28:26,642
I ain't riding no horse with no goddamn dynamite on its back.

1789
02:28:26,808 --> 02:28:28,519
I can understand that.

1790
02:28:28,685 --> 02:28:31,688
Frankie, why don't you take them sticks off that horse...

1791
02:28:31,855 --> 02:28:34,525
...and stick them in the nigger cage?

1792
02:28:35,150 --> 02:28:38,320
A little dynamite for you black fellas to play with.

1793
02:28:48,914 --> 02:28:51,667
Floyd, you got that rifle up on the wagon, don't you?

1794
02:28:51,833 --> 02:28:52,876
Yeah, right.

1795
02:28:53,043 --> 02:28:55,504
Why don't you give him your gun and gun belt?

1796
02:28:55,671 --> 02:28:57,005
Righto.

1797
02:28:57,172 --> 02:29:00,175
Now, don't drop the fucking thing, all right?

1798
02:29:00,342 --> 02:29:03,053
I just had the sights fixed and they're perfect.

1799
02:29:03,220 --> 02:29:05,180
Oh, that's good to know.

1800
02:30:37,107 --> 02:30:38,692
Throw me up that dynamite.

1801
02:32:09,242 --> 02:32:10,827
- Jake. - Yeah?

1802
02:32:10,994 --> 02:32:14,289
Get out there and see what's wrong with them goddamn dogs.

1803
02:32:16,332 --> 02:32:17,459
Get them.

1804
02:32:19,002 --> 02:32:21,004
D'Artagnan, motherfuckers!

1805
02:34:52,533 --> 02:34:54,160
It's me, baby.

1806
02:35:42,209 --> 02:35:48,632
In the sweet by-and-by

1807
02:35:50,926 --> 02:35:53,553
We will meet

1808
02:35:53,720 --> 02:35:58,058
On that beautiful shore

1809
02:36:02,062 --> 02:36:06,441
By-and-by By-and-by

1810
02:36:06,608 --> 02:36:10,779
By-and-by we will meet

1811
02:36:10,946 --> 02:36:12,906
We will meet by-and-by

1812
02:36:13,073 --> 02:36:15,993
Cora, would you prepare us some coffee?

1813
02:36:16,368 --> 02:36:18,328
Sheba, you help her.

1814
02:36:18,495 --> 02:36:19,746
Come on.

1815
02:36:21,748 --> 02:36:25,127
In the sweet...

1816
02:36:25,335 --> 02:36:27,504
By-and-by

1817
02:36:30,048 --> 02:36:33,677
Y'all gonna be together with Calvin in the by-and-by.

1818
02:36:40,017 --> 02:36:42,895
Just a bit sooner than y'all was expecting.

1819
02:36:50,862 --> 02:36:53,906
Billy Crash. Now, where were we?

1820
02:36:54,449 --> 02:36:56,617
Oh, that's right.

1821
02:36:56,951 --> 02:37:01,414
Last time I seen you, you had your hands on my...

1822
02:37:11,340 --> 02:37:12,967
Sweet Jesus.

1823
02:37:13,926 --> 02:37:17,472
Django! You black son of a bitch!

1824
02:37:17,638 --> 02:37:19,057
The D is silent, hillbilly.

1825
02:37:20,224 --> 02:37:21,434
Oh, no!

1826
02:37:23,478 --> 02:37:26,105
Now, all you black folks...

1827
02:37:26,272 --> 02:37:29,734
...I suggest you get away from all these white folks.

1828
02:37:30,693 --> 02:37:32,403
Not you, Stephen.

1829
02:37:33,196 --> 02:37:35,323
You right where you belong.

1830
02:37:37,492 --> 02:37:41,662
Cora, before you go, will you tell Miss Lara goodbye?

1831
02:37:41,829 --> 02:37:42,872
Do what now?

1832
02:37:43,498 --> 02:37:47,169
I said, "Tell Miss Lara goodbye."

1833
02:37:48,462 --> 02:37:50,172
Bye, Miss Lara.

1834
02:37:54,426 --> 02:37:55,677
Y'all two run along now.

1835
02:38:14,446 --> 02:38:18,784
Stephen, how you like my new duds?

1836
02:38:19,493 --> 02:38:22,955
You know, before now I didn't know that burgundy was my colour.

1837
02:38:33,757 --> 02:38:36,009
I count six shots, nigger.

1838
02:38:37,219 --> 02:38:39,054
I count two guns, nigger.

1839
02:38:42,641 --> 02:38:44,810
You said in 76 years on this plantation...

1840
02:38:44,977 --> 02:38:47,646
...you seen all manner of shit done to niggers.

1841
02:38:47,855 --> 02:38:50,816
But I notice, you didn't mention kneecapping.

1842
02:38:51,317 --> 02:38:54,612
Oh, God! Motherfucker! Damn it!

1843
02:38:54,779 --> 02:38:56,447
Seventy-six years, Stephen.

1844
02:38:56,614 --> 02:39:00,243
How many niggers you think you see come and go? Seven thousand?

1845
02:39:00,451 --> 02:39:01,953
Eight thousand?

1846
02:39:02,370 --> 02:39:03,872
Nine thousand?

1847
02:39:04,038 --> 02:39:06,749
Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine?

1848
02:39:06,916 --> 02:39:10,879
Every single word that came out of Calvin Candie's mouth was horseshit.

1849
02:39:11,045 --> 02:39:14,966
But he was right about one thing: I am that one nigger in 10,000.

1850
02:39:17,594 --> 02:39:19,554
You son of a bitch!

1851
02:39:20,638 --> 02:39:22,432
You motherfucker!

1852
02:39:22,599 --> 02:39:24,851
Oh, sweet Jesus, let me kill this nigger.

1853
02:39:26,436 --> 02:39:29,272
You ain't gonna get away with this, Django.

1854
02:39:29,439 --> 02:39:31,482
They gonna catch your black ass.

1855
02:39:31,649 --> 02:39:34,152
You gonna be on the wanted posters now, nigger.

1856
02:39:34,319 --> 02:39:37,113
The bounty hunters gonna be looking for you.

1857
02:39:37,530 --> 02:39:41,326
You can run, nigger, but they gonna find your ass!

1858
02:39:41,492 --> 02:39:45,496
And when they do, oh, Lord, what they gonna do to your ass.

1859
02:39:45,830 --> 02:39:50,376
They ain't gonna just kill you, nigger. You done fucked up!

1860
02:39:50,543 --> 02:39:55,381
This Candyland, nigger. You can't destroy Candyland!

1861
02:39:55,548 --> 02:39:59,261
We been here! There's always gonna be a Candyland.

1862
02:40:10,356 --> 02:40:13,901
Can't no nigger gunfighter kill all the white folks in the world!

1863
02:40:14,068 --> 02:40:16,820
They gonna find your black ass!

1864
02:40:21,325 --> 02:40:23,744
Django!

1865
02:40:23,911 --> 02:40:26,288
You uppity son of a...

1866
02:41:01,032 --> 02:41:02,951
Hey, Little Troublemaker.

1867
02:41:03,118 --> 02:41:05,704
Hey, Big Troublemaker.

1868
02:41:32,480 --> 02:41:34,816
You know what they are going to call you?

1869
02:41:34,983 --> 02:41:37,527
"The fastest gun in the South."

1870
02:41:44,826 --> 02:41:46,453
Let's get out of here.

1871
02:45:15,248 --> 02:45:16,999
Who was that nigger?
