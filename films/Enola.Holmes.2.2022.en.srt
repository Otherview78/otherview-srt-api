00:00:38,113 --> 00:00:39,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop, police!</font>

2
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:42,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop that girl!</font>

3
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:44,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me!</font>

4
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:47,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Terribly sorry.
- Oi!</font>

5
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:50,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch where you're sodding going!</font>

6
00:00:52,113 --> 00:00:53,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop her!</font>

7
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:10,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps I should explain.</font>

8
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,988
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>My name is Enola Holmes.</i></font>

9
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:16,696
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You may remember me.</i></font>

10
00:01:17,696 --> 00:01:19,363
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>After solving my first case...</i></font>

11
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:21,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

12
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:23,988
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I started a business.</i></font>

13
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:26,863
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>A detective agency.</i></font>

14
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:31,405
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Open and ready for my first clients.</i></font>

15
00:01:32,363 --> 00:01:35,613
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I was going to join the pantheon
of great Victorian detectives.</i></font>

16
00:01:36,238 --> 00:01:37,506
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Detective Field.
- Yes.</i></font>

17
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,922
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Mackenzie Macintosh.
- Hi.</i></font>

18
00:01:38,946 --> 00:01:40,666
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Sir Alfred Hornblower.
- Tally-ho!</i></font>

19
00:01:40,738 --> 00:01:44,196
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And the infamous Reginald Swain.</i></font>

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,571
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And best of all,
I would be joining my brother.</i></font>

21
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:48,821
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I would be his equal.</i></font>

22
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:52,696
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>A detective in my own right,</i></font>

23
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,696
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>worthy of the Holmes name.</i></font>

24
00:01:57,363 --> 00:01:58,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations.</font>

25
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,613
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Or so I thought.</i></font>

26
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I addressing the secretary?</font>

27
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're how old?</font>

28
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:16,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stone the crows, you're young.
- My age is an advantage.</font>

29
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:20,238

explore where others won't.</font>

30

<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're a girl.</font>

32
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:30,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I am. Um...</font>

33
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:32,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">What experience have you had?</font>

34
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Tewkesbury case?
- Well, that was Sherlock Holmes.</font>

35
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:39,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That was Sherlock...
- Sherlock...</font>

36
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sherlock Holmes, wasn't it?
- I assure you, it was mine.</font>

37
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:46,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good man, that Tewkesbury. Brave lad.</font>

38
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:47,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tell me...
- Tell me...</font>

39
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:49,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tell me...
- Yes?</font>

40
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:51,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might your brother be free?</font>

41
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Read all about it! Read all about it!</font>

42
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:59,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sherlock Holmes
and the case of the Brixton corpse.</font>

43
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:01,238

attention to herself.</i></font>

48
00:03:23,613 --> 00:03:25,946
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Though that's never
been her forte.</i></font>

49
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:45,696
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yes, and then there is... him.</i></font>

50
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lords,
reform is not a task to be accomplished,</font>

51
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:50,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">nor a bill that can be passed.</font>

52
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rather it is a constant need for change.</font>

53
00:03:56,613 --> 00:04:01,280
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Lord Tewkesbury,
the champion of change and progress.</i></font>

60
00:04:29,363 --> 00:04:30,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a mistake.</font>

61
00:04:31,863 --> 00:04:33,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's your path, Enola.</font>

68

69
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:01,280

70
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enola Holmes?</font>

71
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:28,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes?</font>

72
00:05:28,738 --> 00:05:30,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've come to the right place then.</font>

73
00:05:32,738 --> 00:05:34,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it true you find lost people?</font>

74
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:39,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you get this?</font>

75
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's months old.</font>

76
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found it on the street.</font>

77
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:45,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who have you lost?</font>

78
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:49,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sister.</font>

79
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch the gap.</font>

80
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:15,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">She disappeared a week ago.</font>

81
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:19,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone says she's run away,
but Sarah wouldn't do that,</font>

82
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:20,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">not to me.</font>

83
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:22,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's my only family now.</font>

84
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:28,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way.</font>

85
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:33,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other girls are still at work.</font>

86
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tea?</font>

87
00:06:38,863 --> 00:06:39,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

88
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:42,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might I see her bedroom?</font>

89
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ours, you mean?</font>

90
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're standing in it.</font>

91
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:53,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're lucky.
Most girls here are five to a room.</font>

92
00:06:58,905 --> 00:06:59,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">This might help.</font>

93
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Sarah likes
to leave cheese out for 'em.</font>

94
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:09,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's soft.</font>

95
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:14,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does she look like, Sarah?</font>

96
00:07:14,863 --> 00:07:16,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">About this tall.</font>

97
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:18,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty.</font>

98
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very pretty.</font>

99
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:22,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Green eyes, red hair, freckles...</font>

100
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:23,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Red hair?</font>

101
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:26,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">We weren't sisters in the usual way.</font>

102
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Found sisters.</font>

103
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:30,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah took her in.</font>

104
00:07:30,863 --> 00:07:32,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's this, Bess?</font>

105
00:07:32,988 --> 00:07:35,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Enola Holmes.
- She's a detective.</font>

106
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">She looks like
she'll blow over in the wind.</font>

107
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:38,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mae!</font>

108
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:45,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Bessie, what was Sarah wearing
the day she disappeared?</font>

109
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:48,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's she doing?
- Shh.</font>

110
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:50,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's wasting her time.</font>

111
00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:53,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was her other dress, the green one.</font>

112
00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:57,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does she like reading?</font>

113
00:07:57,571 --> 00:07:59,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh yes. She taught herself.</font>

114
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:03,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah said you had to learn about
the world if you're gonna live in it.</font>

115
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makeup.</font>

116
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:12,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she have a suitor?</font>

117
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:15,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah. But there's plenty
have taken an interest.</font>

118
00:08:18,405 --> 00:08:19,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">She weren't much of a gardener.</font>

119
00:08:23,613 --> 00:08:25,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, how about you quit sniffing round?</font>

120
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:28,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quiet, Mae!
Just let her do her job.</font>

121
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:47,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">The 12th of March.
Does that date mean anything to you?</font>

122
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:48,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough.</font>

123
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:50,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't need help from people like you.</font>

124
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:53,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found her, so she's staying.</font>

125
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody girls poking their nose in.</font>

126
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:04,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And she didn't leave a note?
- Just this.</font>

127
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:10,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">She worked two jobs, you see.
We couldn't get by without it.</font>

128
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Washed glasses at a pub.</font>

129
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:15,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some place called The Stag Antlers.</font>

130
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can have it.</font>

131
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. No, it's all right.
We'll figure that out later.</font>

132
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:25,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">So tell me,
when was the last time you saw her?</font>

133
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">A week ago, at the match factory.</font>

134
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:32,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had a fight with Mr. Crouch,
the foreman, in his office.</font>

135
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What about?
- He said she was thieving.</font>

136
00:09:35,738 --> 00:09:36,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Sarah's honest.</font>

137
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">The match factory,
is that where she works?</font>

138
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:43,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where we all work.
We're match girls, ain't we?</font>

139
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Then that's where we'll start.
- So you'll take it? You'll take the case?</font>

140
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:54,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Miss Holmes.</font>

141
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:56,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

142
00:09:58,071 --> 00:10:00,363
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>At last, my first case.</i></font>

143
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:01,821
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Well, actually, my second.</i></font>

144
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:04,238
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I shall find you, Sarah Chapman.</i></font>

145
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:08,405
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Red hair, green dress,
makeup, science books, 12th March.</i></font>

147
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,655
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>the game is afoot.</i></font>

148
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:16,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay with me. Follow my way.</font>

149
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How many girls work here?
- Five hundred, maybe six.</font>

150
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:25,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I look?</font>

151
00:10:25,696 --> 00:10:28,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is my neckerchief all right?
- Oh, well, it's around your neck.</font>

Mr. Crouch.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Green eyes, red hair.</font>

197
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you did steal something.</font>

198
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charles! This is not what I was
expecting when we made our arrangement.</font>

199
00:14:30,155 --> 00:14:31,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is blatant extortion.</font>

200
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:32,988

whoever was doing this to us.</font>

203
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:42,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sound almost threatening, Mr. Lyon.</font>

204
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:45,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not what I expected
when we began our arrangement.</font>

205
00:14:47,071 --> 00:14:49,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now theft, on top of everything else.</font>

206
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:52,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You heard the man. Get this dealt with.
- Come along, William.</font>

207
00:14:56,946 --> 00:15:00,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, do you have any suspicions
as to who this perpetrator might be?</font>

208
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:02,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would I be asking you if I did?</font>

209
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, sir, perhaps if we were to consider
whether this theft is connected.</font>

210
00:15:09,863 --> 00:15:12,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have ideas...
- Did I ask for your advice?</font>

211
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or did I simply tell you to get it done?</font>

212
00:15:15,988 --> 00:15:18,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make sure the right people know, sir.</font>

213
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:25,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Troy!</font>

214
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:26,905

level of production and efficiency.</font>

216
00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:33,238

- Yes, Father.</font>

217
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:37,696

218
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doris, how are you? How's your sister?
Is she, um, still unwell?</font>

219
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:43,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yes, Mr. Lyon.</font>

220
00:15:43,738 --> 00:15:44,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Typhus.</font>

221
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,780

222
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:51,363

224
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:59,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Lord Mclntyre, if I might suggest
a little lunch. I think we've earned it.</font>

225
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:06,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did Sarah do it?
Get into the office?</font>

226
00:16:06,613 --> 00:16:10,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was a fire at one of the stations.
Foreman got distracted.</font>

227
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:13,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whose station?</font>

228
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:15,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mae's?</font>

229
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,821

234
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:42,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a loose thread.</font>

235
00:16:48,155 --> 00:16:49,613

236
00:16:53,488 --> 00:16:54,988

00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:04,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

309
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:10,280

- Enola.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, let me know when you meet one.</font>

313
00:23:19,821 --> 00:23:22,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Brother, are you quite yourself?
- I'm fine.</font>

314
00:23:22,321 --> 00:23:25,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was just a disagreement
over a glass of wine</font>

315
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,613

<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know you had steps.</font>

327
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">One should always have steps
to avoid people stepping on you.</font>

328
00:24:14,613 --> 00:24:17,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a tip.
You should probably write that down.</font>

329
00:24:17,821 --> 00:24:20,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Lift your right leg.</font>

330
00:24:21,363 --> 00:24:22,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

331
00:24:23,905 --> 00:24:24,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now your left.</font>

332
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:28,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better leg, the left.
You should write that down.</font>

333
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:32,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go.</font>

334
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:36,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha! Home. Well done, Sherlock.</font>

335
00:24:39,155 --> 00:24:40,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do it.</font>

336
00:24:43,696 --> 00:24:44,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">See?</font>

337
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:51,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baker Street.</font>

338
00:24:58,488 --> 00:25:02,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, but it's such a mess.
- It's perfect. Don't touch anything.</font>

339
00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:04,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you investigating?</font>

340
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:06,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of your business.
I work alone. It's private.</font>

341
00:25:07,821 --> 00:25:09,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now shh, I'm thinking.</font>

342
00:25:09,821 --> 00:25:11,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">One should never be interrupted
when thinking.</font>

343
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:15,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh. You should...
- Write that down?</font>

344
00:25:17,488 --> 00:25:19,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh!</font>

345
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't go in there.</font>

346
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

347
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:40,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sherlock's latest case.</font>

348
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:49,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fascinating.</font>

349
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:56,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why, pray, have you moved everything?</font>

350
00:26:00,571 --> 00:26:03,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nothing looks different to me.
- Nothing looks different? Ev...</font>

351
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your head is sore? I can't think why.</font>

352
00:26:07,238 --> 00:26:09,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is why
I don't have people in my rooms.</font>

353
00:26:10,738 --> 00:26:14,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look what you've done.
My papers are entirely out of order.</font>

354
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your case, it's vexing you.</font>

355
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:21,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems to be an awful lot of question marks
on that map of yours.</font>

356
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dundee cake. Door.</font>

357
00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:26,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I will see you again.
Is that why you're drinking?</font>

358
00:26:26,238 --> 00:26:29,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm more than certain...
it's not so old.</font>

359
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:31,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe I can help.
- You can help by leaving.</font>

360
00:26:32,821 --> 00:26:35,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh. Yes. The world
will be a much safer place</font>

361
00:26:36,071 --> 00:26:39,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we don't see the inside
of Sherlock Holmes, only the out.</font>

362
00:26:41,238 --> 00:26:42,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crazy idea.</font>

363
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:45,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever considered a flatmate?</font>

364
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:48,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">- For what purpose?
- To stop you descending into this.</font>

365
00:26:52,405 --> 00:26:53,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strange</font>

366
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:58,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">how those seeking advice
so often like to dispense it.</font>

367
00:26:58,363 --> 00:27:01,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I ask for advice?
I found you on the street, drunk.</font>

368
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:04,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now what may I observe about you?
- We're not playing this game.</font>

369
00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:05,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoes a state. Hair's not much better.</font>

370
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You and Mycroft are so similar.
- You need to wash your clothes.</font>

371
00:27:09,155 --> 00:27:11,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Unwilling to look past...
- You are pale...</font>

372
00:27:11,321 --> 00:27:14,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop!
- And then there's your fingernails.</font>

373
00:27:14,863 --> 00:27:17,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why are you working in a match factory?
- What?</font>

374
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last night, they were dirty with green
traces. This morning, they are black.</font>

375
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">The phosphorous from the match-making
has mixed with oxygen.</font>

376
00:27:24,155 --> 00:27:27,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't in such a state
as to not see that.</font>

377
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:29,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How did you...
- And your neck is red.</font>

378
00:27:29,696 --> 00:27:31,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone has gripped it
or held a knife against...</font>

379
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you involved in something dangerous?</font>

380
00:27:40,155 --> 00:27:41,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are still my ward.</font>

381
00:27:41,363 --> 00:27:44,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you need my help,
my offer remains on the table.</font>

382
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:48,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be so desperate
to prove yourself, Enola.</font>

383
00:27:49,696 --> 00:27:54,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not desperate,
and I don't need your or anyone's help.</font>

384
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this I will have.</font>

385
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare he?
How dare he lecture me?</font>

386
00:28:11,738 --> 00:28:13,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">When he can't even solve his own case</font>

387
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:16,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he lives in a bed of flummoxing papers
and bewildering mold.</font>

388
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare he claim I'm desperate?
It is not true.</font>

389
00:28:19,905 --> 00:28:21,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And this is not fair.
- Enola?</font>

390
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is you.</font>

391
00:28:29,405 --> 00:28:30,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it is you.</font>

392
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:33,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you?</font>

393
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you well? You look...</font>

394
00:28:36,446 --> 00:28:40,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on a case. Undercover. Forget
I told you that piece of information.</font>

395
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:44,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the strangest thing. I could have
sworn I've seen you here before.</font>

396
00:28:46,196 --> 00:28:47,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that right?</font>

397
00:28:47,238 --> 00:28:50,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this is my...
My route through to the Lords.</font>

398
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:53,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it? How lovely.</font>

399
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:56,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I... I breakfast here on occasion.</font>

400
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:03,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, yes, it's a lovely place.
I-I know the gardener here.</font>

401
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:07,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been discussing
what to sow for next year's crop.</font>

402
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:08,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some fine sunflowers.</font>

403
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:11,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Sweet Williams,
for their lovely vivid reds.</font>

404
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen all you're doing.</font>

405
00:29:14,196 --> 00:29:16,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Well, it's... It's nothing.</font>

406

408
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't believe all you read.</font>

409
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wrote to you.</font>

410
00:29:36,405 --> 00:29:37,405

411
00:29:37,905 --> 00:29:38,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

412
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:41,613

413
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Starting my own business.
A perpetual challenge.</font>

414
00:29:45,155 --> 00:29:46,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps, not something you'd understand.</font>

415
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:50,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, Enola, if you need help...
- I do not.</font>

416
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:54,613

I shall seek you out.</font>

00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:36,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like sewing a new skirt...</font>

448
00:31:39,571 --> 00:31:42,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">which I don't do,
or teaching a dog to sit.</font>

449
00:31:43,446 --> 00:31:46,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">You begin to glow with the acknowledgement
of a job well done.</font>

450
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a new Holmes in town.</font>

451
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:51,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right. Sherlock Holmes
has met his match.</font>

452
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:55,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name will be known,
and Bessie will have a sister once again.</font>

453
00:31:56,571 --> 00:31:58,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that is a job well...</font>

454
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:01,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">done.</font>

455
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:27,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah?</font>

456
00:32:42,988 --> 00:32:44,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened here?</font>

457
00:32:54,988 --> 00:32:56,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Poppy.</font>

458
00:33:06,988 --> 00:33:08,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Mae.</font>

459
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:13,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened? Who did this to you?</font>

460
00:33:13,905 --> 00:33:17,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it him, Sarah's man? Mae!</font>

461
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. It's all right.</font>

462
00:33:20,405 --> 00:33:22,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll fetch a doctor for you.</font>

463
00:33:23,946 --> 00:33:25,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No, no, no.</font>

464
00:33:26,155 --> 00:33:27,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

465
00:33:27,655 --> 00:33:28,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come back.</font>

466
00:34:05,155 --> 00:34:06,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Holmes?</font>

467
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inspector Lestrade.</font>

468
00:34:09,863 --> 00:34:11,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Enola Holmes.
- Lestrade.</font>

469
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She... She's...
- Dead.</font>

470
00:34:14,988 --> 00:34:15,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd that happen?</font>

471
00:34:20,613 --> 00:34:24,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no, no. I'm investigating a case.
A disappearance of a girl.</font>

472
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:27,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What, that girl?
- No. No, no, no. H-Her name is Mae.</font>

473
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">She worked at the Paragon Theater,
the matchstick factory.</font>

474
00:34:31,113 --> 00:34:34,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was a dancer. She's friends...</font>

475
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Superintendent Grail.</font>

476
00:34:55,571 --> 00:34:57,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.</font>

477
00:34:58,071 --> 00:35:00,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was sent to investigate
a possible disturbance.</font>

478
00:35:00,655 --> 00:35:03,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone heard some screams,
and then I discovered this young lady.</font>

479
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:04,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her name?</font>

480
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enola Holmes.</font>

481
00:35:07,863 --> 00:35:08,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, his sister.</font>

482
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">A detective too.</font>

483
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:13,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good God, another one.</font>

484
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:15,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't you be in finishing school?</font>

485
00:35:16,738 --> 00:35:19,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Investigating the disappearance of a...</font>

486
00:35:19,613 --> 00:35:20,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sarah Chapman.
- Yeah.</font>

487
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:24,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah Chapman?
Well, well, how intriguing. So am I.</font>

488
00:35:24,571 --> 00:35:27,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's wanted for theft and blackmail.
- Blackmail?</font>

489
00:35:27,738 --> 00:35:29,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, detective.</font>

490
00:35:31,613 --> 00:35:33,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still warm. No rigor mortis.</font>

491
00:35:34,613 --> 00:35:37,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">- When were the screams heard, inspector?
- Ten past the hour, sir.</font>

492
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did you arrive, detective?</font>

493
00:35:41,196 --> 00:35:42,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">A-Around the same time.</font>

494
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:46,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even more intriguing.</font>

495
00:35:46,988 --> 00:35:51,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, no, I was trying to suppress
the blood. I-I was trying to save her.</font>

496
00:35:51,446 --> 00:35:53,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or trying to get information out of her.</font>

497
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:56,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give her a search, inspector.</font>

498
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I couldn't. I can't pat her down, sir.</font>

499
00:36:00,238 --> 00:36:03,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come along, Lestrade.
Let's not be coy about this.</font>

500
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:06,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's a detective. She knows the rules.
- Yes.</font>

501
00:36:09,405 --> 00:36:11,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

502
00:36:11,238 --> 00:36:12,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me that bag!</font>

503
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:22,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this?</font>

504
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">My evidence.</font>

505
00:36:26,321 --> 00:36:27,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that?</font>

506
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:31,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nothing.</font>

507
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:32,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why are you hiding it?</font>

508
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Found at a murder scene
with a freshly dead corpse,</font>

509
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:39,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">harboring evidence isn't gonna look good.</font>

510
00:36:39,696 --> 00:36:41,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Superintendent Grail, you can't believe...</font>

511
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:44,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can't I believe, missy?</font>

512
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:47,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">That young ladies
don't have the hands for killing?</font>

513
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:48,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, give them here.</font>

514
00:36:54,155 --> 00:36:55,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

515
00:37:05,946 --> 00:37:08,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go on!
- After her, all of ya!</font>

516
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why ever would she ever do that?</font>

517
00:37:11,905 --> 00:37:14,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of the way! Move!</font>

518
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:16,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop that girl!</font>

519
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:20,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've seen this before.</font>

520
00:37:25,071 --> 00:37:28,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.
You remember me, I hope.</font>

521
00:37:32,905 --> 00:37:35,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're looking for your sister.
She's caused a bit of trouble.</font>

522
00:37:45,488 --> 00:37:46,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I?</font>

523
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it, sir?</font>

524
00:37:58,738 --> 00:37:59,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it?</font>

525
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:02,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it. I have others.</font>

526
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it? I can't.</font>

527
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:05,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can.</font>

528
00:38:05,196 --> 00:38:06,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.</font>

529
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps I can.</font>

530
00:38:15,571 --> 00:38:17,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this, the famous fiddle?</font>

531
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:21,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I do not have two of.</font>

532
00:38:22,488 --> 00:38:25,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you can explain
what you believe Enola has done.</font>

533
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I was at liberty to say, sir.</font>

534
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you mind?</font>

535
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:43,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, your latest case.</font>

536
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's it concerning?</font>

537
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it another Brixton Strangler?</font>

538
00:38:48,488 --> 00:38:49,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or a Periwinkle?</font>

539
00:38:50,821 --> 00:38:52,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell me it's a Clerkenwell.</font>

540
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:54,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">What evidence do they have
against my sister?</font>

541
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:58,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps, uh, you tell me yours
and I'll tell you mine.</font>

542
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:02,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Government case, some missing money.</font>

543
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:05,155
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now you.</i></font>

544
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,446
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Super wants to talk her.</i></font>

545
00:39:08,238 --> 00:39:10,530
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Why?</i>
- Just following orders, Mr. Holmes.</font>

546
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:12,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or may I call you Sherlock?</font>

547
00:39:14,446 --> 00:39:17,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Graydon. Graydon Lestrade.</font>

548
00:39:17,113 --> 00:39:20,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father thought it distinguished,
and it is rather.</font>

549
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, anyway, should you ever
wish to call me that...</font>

550
00:39:30,238 --> 00:39:31,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

551
00:39:34,113 --> 00:39:35,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you were.</font>

552
00:39:45,863 --> 00:39:47,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh dear.</font>

553
00:39:49,113 --> 00:39:50,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa!</font>

554
00:39:51,696 --> 00:39:54,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mistake.
I should have warned you I was opening it.</font>

555
00:39:57,446 --> 00:39:58,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

556
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dare I ask?</font>

557
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good afternoon.</font>

558
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:15,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I ask a favor?</font>

559
00:40:20,655 --> 00:40:23,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never mind. Tell me everything.</font>

560
00:40:24,196 --> 00:40:25,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A government case?
- No.</font>

561
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:28,946
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Is it
another Brixton Strangler?</i></font>

562
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:32,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or... Or a Periwinkle?</font>

563
00:40:32,738 --> 00:40:34,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You tell me yours
and I'll tell you mine."</font>

564
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:38,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a ninny. I needed to know
what he had on you.</font>

565
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:46,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Money. Unaccounted transfers
going in and out of government offices.</font>

566
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:49,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">My theory is either bribery,
extortion, or blackmail.</font>

567
00:40:49,571 --> 00:40:50,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what have you found?</font>

568
00:40:52,696 --> 00:40:54,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Separate filings
from five different accounts</font>

569
00:40:54,863 --> 00:40:58,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">going via the Treasury
into one private bank.</font>

570
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So someone is getting rich from this?
- Yes.</font>

571
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who?
- No name.</font>

572
00:41:04,155 --> 00:41:05,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a number.</font>

573
00:41:05,655 --> 00:41:08,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I visited the bank and inquired.
The money disappeared,</font>

574
00:41:08,696 --> 00:41:10,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">arriving at another bank,
and then another,</font>

575
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:13,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">and another, and another,
and another, and another.</font>

576
00:41:13,196 --> 00:41:16,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every one of them hidden
using different account numbers.</font>

577
00:41:16,946 --> 00:41:18,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twenty-seven in total.</font>

578
00:41:18,196 --> 00:41:21,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, what can you deduce from that?
- Three things.</font>

579
00:41:22,196 --> 00:41:25,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Firstly, the man's a game player,
perhaps a genius in mathematics,</font>

580
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">capable of covering his traces
at every turn.</font>

581
00:41:28,196 --> 00:41:30,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Secondly, the sources are varied.</font>

582
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five banks, south of the river,
but no clear link between them.</font>

583
00:41:34,571 --> 00:41:35,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">All anonymous.</font>

584
00:41:35,988 --> 00:41:39,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">All going into one pocket.</font>

585
00:41:40,571 --> 00:41:41,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the third?</font>

586
00:41:44,821 --> 00:41:45,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows I'm onto him.</font>

587
00:41:47,446 --> 00:41:48,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? How?</font>

588
00:41:48,363 --> 00:41:51,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time I pull a thread,
it loosens, vanishes,</font>

589
00:41:51,946 --> 00:41:54,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">reappears somewhere else.
He's leading me a merry dance.</font>

590
00:41:54,738 --> 00:41:55,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's...</font>

591
00:41:57,988 --> 00:41:58,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's infuriating.</font>

592
00:42:00,113 --> 00:42:02,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">So no leads whatsoever?</font>

593
00:42:02,696 --> 00:42:04,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">One. A week before the first transfer,</font>

594
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">there was a break-in
at the Treasury office</font>

595
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">by a man in a taper crown hat.</font>

596
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:08,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">A taper crown hat.</font>

597
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:10,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What was taken?
- A document.</font>

598
00:42:10,988 --> 00:42:13,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">They won't talk about it.
Sensitive information presumably.</font>

599
00:42:14,196 --> 00:42:18,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how it connects to all of this
has so far eluded me.</font>

600
00:42:18,571 --> 00:42:21,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your turn. I hope the blood's not yours.</font>

601
00:42:22,363 --> 00:42:24,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking for a girl, Sarah Chapman.</font>

602
00:42:24,613 --> 00:42:27,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her sister employed me. Bessie.</font>

603
00:42:28,155 --> 00:42:31,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">She worked at Lyons match factory by day,
and the music hall at night.</font>

604
00:42:32,405 --> 00:42:33,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has a lover,</font>

605
00:42:34,571 --> 00:42:36,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">whose flat I visited.</font>

606
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd given her this.</font>

607
00:42:42,488 --> 00:42:43,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">28 Bell Place?</font>

608
00:42:45,113 --> 00:42:46,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whitechapel, yes.</font>

609
00:42:46,571 --> 00:42:48,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there I found her friend,</font>

610
00:42:50,113 --> 00:42:51,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">murdered.</font>

611
00:42:55,238 --> 00:42:57,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who killed her? This poppy fellow?</font>

612
00:43:01,696 --> 00:43:03,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suspect so.</font>

613
00:43:03,155 --> 00:43:05,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps he kidnapped Sarah
and her friend discovered it.</font>

614
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:08,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love.</font>

615
00:43:09,071 --> 00:43:10,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">What it does to people.</font>

616
00:43:12,821 --> 00:43:14,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How was she killed?
- A kitchen knife.</font>

617
00:43:14,446 --> 00:43:15,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you touch this weapon?
- No.</font>

618
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why did you run?</font>

619
00:43:18,946 --> 00:43:20,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found more evidence on her.</font>

620
00:43:20,613 --> 00:43:22,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">This policeman wanted it.</font>

621
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He has this walk.
- Grail.</font>

622
00:43:26,155 --> 00:43:27,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a history.</font>

623
00:43:28,905 --> 00:43:30,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was in her pocket.</font>

624
00:43:51,071 --> 00:43:52,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's as bad as the poem.</font>

625
00:43:54,071 --> 00:43:55,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Leave it with me.
- No.</font>

626
00:43:56,155 --> 00:43:58,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's mine, and it's important.</font>

627
00:43:59,696 --> 00:44:03,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grail said she had stolen something
and that she was blackmailing them.</font>

628
00:44:03,696 --> 00:44:06,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Though Sarah wouldn't do that.
- You don't know this person.</font>

629
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:09,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel I do.</font>

630
00:44:09,946 --> 00:44:11,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came here running from the police.</font>

631
00:44:12,071 --> 00:44:13,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone is already dead,</font>

632
00:44:13,905 --> 00:44:16,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you are now a suspect
in a murder case.</font>

633
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:18,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've let your emotions
get the better of you.</font>

634
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay here. Don't leave.
I will look into this.</font>

635
00:44:21,696 --> 00:44:25,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Sarah Chapman is my responsibility.
No one else cares for these girls.</font>

636
00:44:26,155 --> 00:44:27,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promised her sister.</font>

637
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first mistake a detective makes</font>

638
00:44:29,655 --> 00:44:33,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to make it about themselves
and not the case.</font>

639
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:43,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enola, I know you're not a fan
of unnecessary advice,</font>

640
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">but please...</font>

641
00:44:48,113 --> 00:44:49,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't turn into me.</font>

642
00:44:53,905 --> 00:44:55,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should probably write that down.</font>

643
00:44:56,946 --> 00:44:59,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Matches, matches!
Come buy your matches!</font>

644
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only a penny a box.</font>

645
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Matches, matches! Only a penny a box.</font>

646
00:45:05,488 --> 00:45:06,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come buy your matches!</font>

647
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:09,110
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Posh girls like you
don't belong in this fight.</i></font>

648
00:45:09,155 --> 00:45:11,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't need help from people like you.</font>

649
00:45:13,238 --> 00:45:17,821
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>See, they all think there's hope.
That love is coming their way.</i></font>

650
00:45:17,905 --> 00:45:19,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it never is.</font>

651
00:45:20,321 --> 00:45:22,405
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Gents like that, they want cheap,</i></font>

652
00:45:22,488 --> 00:45:23,988
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>but they marry dear.</i></font>

653
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:29,613
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So, Poppy, you're a gent, are you?</i></font>

654
00:45:30,196 --> 00:45:33,363
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And a well-heeled one
to afford a love nest like that.</i></font>

655
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sir...
- Don't be ridiculous.</font>

656
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:26,321
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There was a break-in
at the Treasury office</i></font>

657
00:46:26,405 --> 00:46:27,905
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>by a man in a taper crown hat.</i></font>

658
00:46:33,196 --> 00:46:36,655
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Five banks, south of the river,
but no clear link between them.</i></font>

659
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Match makers ball."</font>

660
00:46:44,613 --> 00:46:48,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hosted by Henry and Hilda Lyon.
12 Marchmont Square."</font>

661
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does that date mean anything to you?</font>

662
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a date at all.</font>

663
00:46:57,988 --> 00:47:01,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Their eldest son, William Lyon,
will be leading the first..."</font>

664
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:04,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweet Williams,
for their wonderfully vivid reds.</font>

665
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our ladies are working at the highest
level of production and efficiency.</font>

666
00:47:08,488 --> 00:47:10,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are they not, William?
- Yes, Father.</font>

667
00:47:10,363 --> 00:47:13,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all along, I thought you were a poppy.</font>

668
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:19,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see how sweet you are,
Sweet William.</font>

669
00:47:22,946 --> 00:47:23,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to a ball.</font>

670
00:47:26,988 --> 00:47:27,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

671
00:47:49,321 --> 00:47:50,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Tis I.</font>

672
00:47:51,988 --> 00:47:53,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Tis not I.</font>

673
00:47:54,113 --> 00:47:56,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which, when you're wanted
by the police, is most useful.</font>

674
00:47:57,488 --> 00:48:00,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pray silence
for his Lordship Viscount Mclntyre.</font>

675
00:48:00,988 --> 00:48:03,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I'm sorry to break apart
this glorious occasion,</font>

676
00:48:03,655 --> 00:48:05,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, well, I'm a politician.</font>

677
00:48:05,363 --> 00:48:08,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any chance to stand on a stage,
I'll always take it.</font>

678
00:48:09,488 --> 00:48:12,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I must speak
to thank our host</font>

679
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">and applaud his achievements.</font>

680
00:48:17,196 --> 00:48:18,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">No masks, no matter.</font>

681
00:48:18,738 --> 00:48:22,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">For Henry Lyon
turns all before him into gold.</font>

682
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:24,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha, nonsense! Pewter at best.</font>

683
00:48:25,696 --> 00:48:28,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">What he has done with matches
is legendary.</font>

684
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:31,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">In two years, he's turned red into black.</font>

685
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:32,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or should I say,</font>

686
00:48:33,905 --> 00:48:36,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">red into white?</font>

687
00:48:36,321 --> 00:48:38,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to have this humble man
turn his attention</font>

688
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">to typhoid and the working poor,</font>

689
00:48:41,363 --> 00:48:44,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">raising funds,

690
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm overwhelmed. I'm simply overwhelmed.</font>

691
00:48:46,946 --> 00:48:51,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Henry Lyon.</font>

692
00:48:51,155 --> 00:48:56,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to his fine son, his heir, William.</font>

693
00:48:58,488 --> 00:48:59,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the future.</font>

694
00:49:00,363 --> 00:49:04,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">- To the future.
- May it ever be bright.</font>

695
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:08,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, Henry, light us up.</font>

696
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gladly.</font>

697
00:49:15,321 --> 00:49:17,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now go and enjoy yourselves.</font>

698
00:49:23,863 --> 00:49:25,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe I've seen that dress
somewhere before.</font>

699
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh yes, last year.</font>

700
00:49:30,446 --> 00:49:32,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's charming, elegant.</font>

701
00:49:32,988 --> 00:49:34,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you are kind.</font>

702
00:49:48,613 --> 00:49:49,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen.</font>

703
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:51,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ma'am.</font>

704
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening.</font>

705
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a wonderful occasion, is it not?</font>

706
00:50:02,155 --> 00:50:07,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, the guests are just... delightful.</font>

707
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the orchestra is most tuneful.</font>

708
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:18,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was wondering if</font>

709
00:50:19,321 --> 00:50:21,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might be able to speak to you, Mr. Lyon.</font>

710
00:50:24,613 --> 00:50:27,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, have I said something wrong?
- Where is your chaperone?</font>

711
00:50:28,321 --> 00:50:29,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chaperone?</font>

712
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dear, you can hardly expect my son
to talk to you unaccompanied.</font>

713
00:50:36,571 --> 00:50:38,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

714
00:50:44,488 --> 00:50:47,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot talk to you without a chaperone?</font>

715
00:50:47,321 --> 00:50:48,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, of course not.</font>

716
00:50:48,946 --> 00:50:49,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly?</font>

717
00:50:52,238 --> 00:50:53,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly?</font>

718
00:50:54,113 --> 00:50:55,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is this woman?</font>

719
00:50:55,488 --> 00:50:57,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they are talking.</font>

720
00:50:57,238 --> 00:50:58,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are dancing.</font>

721
00:50:59,196 --> 00:51:00,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening, my dear.</font>

722
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

723
00:51:03,113 --> 00:51:04,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">How foolish of me.</font>

724
00:51:06,155 --> 00:51:07,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening.</font>

725
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could be claimed,
with some justification,</font>

726
00:51:25,988 --> 00:51:27,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I might have prepared
more thoroughly.</font>

727
00:51:27,863 --> 00:51:30,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">But dancing is not
one of my core strengths.</font>

728
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,321

749
00:52:55,946 --> 00:52:58,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terrible, aren't they? These things.</font>

750
00:52:59,613 --> 00:53:01,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">All pompidou and popinjay.</font>

751
00:53:02,321 --> 00:53:03,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have we met somewhere before?</font>

752
00:53:04,905 --> 00:53:08,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel I recognize you from somewhere.</font>

753
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">I simply have one of those faces.</font>

754
00:53:13,905 --> 00:53:14,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mira Troy,</font>

755
00:53:15,405 --> 00:53:17,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">private secretary to Lord Mclntyre,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Tabitha Timothy.</font>

759
00:53:27,363 --> 00:53:29,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mustn't let them concern you.</font>

760
00:53:29,821 --> 00:53:31,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a performance.</font>

761
00:53:32,113 --> 00:53:34,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone here is playing a part.</font>

762
00:53:35,196 --> 00:53:36,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Testing each other.</font>

763
00:53:38,946 --> 00:53:39,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winning.</font>

764
00:53:41,405 --> 00:53:42,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Losing.</font>

765
00:53:43,571 --> 00:53:44,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's fun,</font>

766
00:53:45,738 --> 00:53:47,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">once you know the rules.</font>

767
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are they doing with those fans?</font>

768
00:53:58,196 --> 00:53:59,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sending messages.</font>

769
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:03,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saying everything that is forbidden,</font>

770
00:54:05,238 --> 00:54:08,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">or too embarrassing to say aloud.</font>

771
00:54:13,488 --> 00:54:15,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for the lesson.</font>

772
00:54:16,738 --> 00:54:18,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a lesson hard learned.</font>

773
00:54:20,655 --> 00:54:24,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without power, we women
must rely on our wits for our fortune,</font>

774
00:54:24,821 --> 00:54:27,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">because our chances are short. Here.</font>

775
00:54:28,113 --> 00:54:29,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take my fan.</font>

776
00:54:30,321 --> 00:54:31,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no use for it.</font>

777
00:54:33,113 --> 00:54:35,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you wish to speak to William,</font>

778
00:54:37,988 --> 00:54:39,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">you could always try with that.</font>

779
00:54:57,196 --> 00:54:58,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not... No, not you. Oh.</font>

780
00:55:01,571 --> 00:55:02,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help.</font>

781
00:55:05,113 --> 00:55:06,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would be my delight.</font>

782
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really, there's no need to be rude.</font>

783
00:55:12,905 --> 00:55:14,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I didn't mean to.</font>

784
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:31,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tewkesbury!</font>

785
00:55:31,405 --> 00:55:33,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your timing's impeccable!
- Enola?</font>

786
00:55:33,905 --> 00:55:36,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't speak to me here, otherwise
you'll be thrown onto the street.</font>

787
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:44,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I need you to teach me to dance.
- Teach you to dance? When?</font>

788
00:55:44,238 --> 00:55:46,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Teach me to dance now.
- Wh...</font>

789
00:55:46,363 --> 00:55:48,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand
I've been learning since I was five?</font>

790
00:55:48,655 --> 00:55:51,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. I'd feared
you'd be a terrible teacher.</font>

791
00:55:51,738 --> 00:55:54,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for a murderer.</font>

792
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though I shouldn't have told you.
Forget I told you that.</font>

793
00:55:57,946 --> 00:56:01,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm trying to save a girl's life.
- Through dance?</font>

794
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Tewkesbury.</font>

795
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Hold your back straight.</font>

796
00:56:11,113 --> 00:56:14,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'll place my hand here and here.</font>

797
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:15,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Yes.</font>

798
00:56:16,946 --> 00:56:17,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold your arm out.</font>

799
00:56:19,405 --> 00:56:20,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

800
00:56:20,905 --> 00:56:22,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I will lead and you will follow.</font>

801
00:56:23,071 --> 00:56:25,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That seems like a mistake.
- Face over my shoulder.</font>

802
00:56:27,488 --> 00:56:30,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now, one, two, three.</font>

803
00:56:31,071 --> 00:56:33,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two, three. Two, three.</font>

804
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four, two, three. One, two, three.</font>

805
00:56:36,738 --> 00:56:37,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two, three.</font>

806
00:56:38,905 --> 00:56:39,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

807
00:56:46,238 --> 00:56:48,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem different since last we spoke.</font>

808
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:51,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me why you've been
coming to the park.</font>

809
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why... Why watch me walk to the Lords?</font>

810
00:56:54,155 --> 00:56:55,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simply keeping an eye on you,</font>

811
00:56:56,071 --> 00:56:58,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">in case you get yourself
into any more scrapes.</font>

812
00:56:58,196 --> 00:57:00,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Getting thrown out of trains.
- Enola...</font>

813
00:57:00,738 --> 00:57:02,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">You cannot be trusted
to take care of yourself.</font>

814
00:57:03,613 --> 00:57:04,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a man now.</font>

815
00:57:04,571 --> 00:57:06,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a man when I tell you you're a man.</font>

816
00:57:06,363 --> 00:57:09,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the scrapes I find myself in
are far less visceral.</font>

817
00:57:13,155 --> 00:57:14,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, come on.</font>

818
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two, three. Two, three.</font>

819
00:57:18,821 --> 00:57:19,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look into my eyes.</font>

820
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:22,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rhythm is always there.</font>

821
00:57:23,613 --> 00:57:25,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dancing is a trust, it's a union.</font>

822
00:57:25,655 --> 00:57:27,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I've always loved it,</font>

823
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">even when I was being tutored by my uncle.</font>

824
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">That man likes a pork mustard pie.</font>

825
00:57:32,655 --> 00:57:33,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">His breath...</font>

826
00:57:34,196 --> 00:57:35,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn, two.</font>

827
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:37,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn. Feel it?</font>

828
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can feel it.</font>

829
00:57:48,405 --> 00:57:49,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

830
00:57:50,446 --> 00:57:52,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You dance well.
- Perhaps I have a fine teacher.</font>

831
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:56,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though his breath has less mustard
on it than I'd hoped.</font>

832
00:58:18,321 --> 00:58:21,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have an urgent situation.</font>

833
00:58:21,155 --> 00:58:22,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should go.</font>

834
00:58:22,863 --> 00:58:24,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll need a dance card.</font>

835
00:58:25,446 --> 00:58:26,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't know enough.</font>

836
00:58:30,071 --> 00:58:31,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What does that mean?
- You'll learn.</font>

837
00:58:36,488 --> 00:58:39,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't touch the ginger cake.
Plays hopscotch with your bowels.</font>

838
00:58:51,821 --> 00:58:52,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

839
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

840
00:58:59,863 --> 00:59:02,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Lyon.
- Yes.</font>

841
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:05,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was wondering
if we might have a dance this evening.</font>

842
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dance card is full.</font>

843
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I see it?</font>

844
00:59:16,363 --> 00:59:18,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your last waltz is still free.</font>

845
00:59:18,696 --> 00:59:19,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">How fitting.</font>

846
00:59:21,905 --> 00:59:22,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you mind?</font>

847
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:35,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until then.</font>

848
00:59:55,196 --> 00:59:56,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Tis he.</font>

849
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:05,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">You admire Lord Tewkesbury?</font>

850
01:00:06,321 --> 01:00:07,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

851
01:00:08,155 --> 01:00:09,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

852
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are old friends.</font>

853
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:15,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear he's a good man,
and a great reformer.</font>

854
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:17,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

855
01:00:18,196 --> 01:00:21,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you wish to dance with him,
you may have to wait.</font>

856
01:00:21,155 --> 01:00:22,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's quite a queue.</font>

857
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I mustn't lose my chance.</font>

858
01:00:29,655 --> 01:00:31,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening, Miss...?</font>

859
01:00:31,321 --> 01:00:32,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tabitha.</font>

860
01:00:33,071 --> 01:00:34,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cicely.</font>

861
01:00:41,655 --> 01:00:43,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me for interrupting.
My name is Cicely.</font>

862
01:00:43,905 --> 01:00:47,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, your friend Tabitha
suggested we might dance.</font>

863
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she?</font>

864
01:00:56,446 --> 01:01:01,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen, please
take your partners for the last waltz.</font>

865
01:01:27,488 --> 01:01:29,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I swear I know your face.</font>

866
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:31,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">What must it be?</font>

867
01:01:31,946 --> 01:01:33,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have never met before,</font>

868
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I've seen you looking. Why?</font>

869
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:42,530
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Of course. The Paragon Music Hall.</i></font>

870
01:01:43,196 --> 01:01:45,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you talking
with a young woman there.</font>

871
01:01:46,363 --> 01:01:47,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah Chapman.</font>

872
01:01:49,571 --> 01:01:52,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dislocate from me and I will scream.</font>

873
01:01:52,113 --> 01:01:55,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">The police are onto you, Mr. Lyon.
As it happens, they are onto us both.</font>

874
01:01:57,905 --> 01:01:59,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were not invited here.
What do you want?</font>

875
01:02:00,071 --> 01:02:03,655
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm a private detective,
hired by Sarah's sister to find her.</i></font>

876
01:02:04,238 --> 01:02:05,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bessie hired you?</font>

877
01:02:05,613 --> 01:02:06,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know Bessie?</font>

878
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:10,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave me be, please,</font>

879
01:02:11,071 --> 01:02:12,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">or you will ruin everything.</font>

880
01:02:13,155 --> 01:02:16,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How? What will I ruin?
They're watching.</font>

881
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:21,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you must persist with this,
meet me in the library at midnight.</font>

882
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say nothing more now.</font>

883
01:02:24,946 --> 01:02:26,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Midnight it is.</font>

884
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:56,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Moriarty."</font>

885
01:02:59,363 --> 01:03:00,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

886
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:14,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My word, you do get in awkward places.
- Why are you holding a poker?</font>

887
01:03:15,071 --> 01:03:17,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must leave. I'm waiting for another.</font>

888
01:03:17,321 --> 01:03:19,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another you're scared of
such that you need a weapon?</font>

889
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:21,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are always here
when I don't want you to be.</font>

890
01:03:21,863 --> 01:03:23,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">And sometimes here when you do.</font>

891
01:03:23,988 --> 01:03:26,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing that need concern you.</font>

892
01:03:28,196 --> 01:03:32,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like the look of the one you were
dancing with. What's her name, Cicely?</font>

893
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">She would make you an excellent wife.</font>

894
01:03:34,488 --> 01:03:36,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enola, I am concerned only for you.</font>

895
01:03:36,405 --> 01:03:39,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tewkesbury, if you're still here,
you may scare him away.</font>

896
01:03:39,446 --> 01:03:42,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Scare him"? All of this is over a man?</font>

897
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:45,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just leave.</font>

898
01:03:55,905 --> 01:03:56,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Tewkesbury.</font>

899
01:04:00,488 --> 01:04:02,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enola Holmes, you're under arrest.</font>

900
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:04,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try to escape,
and we will make this difficult.</font>

901
01:04:05,071 --> 01:04:08,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's make it quiet and spare
the fine people any embarrassment.</font>

902
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:11,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sir, whatever this is about, I'm sure...
- Murder, sir.</font>

903
01:04:13,488 --> 01:04:14,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's about murder.</font>

904
01:04:17,946 --> 01:04:19,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tewkesbury, it's all right.</font>

905
01:04:20,405 --> 01:04:21,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Constable, go on.</font>

906
01:04:23,321 --> 01:04:24,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep them safe.</font>

907
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:27,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please.
- Come along.</font>

908
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:32,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow.</font>

909
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:37,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, I say.
- I knew she didn't belong here.</font>

910
01:04:45,988 --> 01:04:47,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Despicable.
- Disgraceful.</font>

911
01:04:57,821 --> 01:04:59,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quite a party.</font>

912
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:03,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">You danced with young Master Lyon, I hear.</font>

913
01:05:04,946 --> 01:05:08,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I ask, impertinently, I'm sure,</font>

914
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">did you want to kiss him,</font>

915
01:05:10,446 --> 01:05:12,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">or find out more about your case,</font>

916
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">this Sarah Chapman?</font>

917
01:05:19,655 --> 01:05:23,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if you're trying to protect her,</font>

918
01:05:24,488 --> 01:05:25,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">know this.</font>

919
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:28,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will protect her better.</font>

920
01:05:30,155 --> 01:05:32,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's someone wants to talk to her,</font>

921
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:34,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they're not as kind as me.</font>

922
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Someone"?</font>

923
01:05:39,155 --> 01:05:39,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

924
01:05:42,196 --> 01:05:44,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why were you following me that night?</font>

925
01:05:47,946 --> 01:05:50,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were following Mae too, weren't you?</font>

926
01:05:51,446 --> 01:05:52,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why you found the flat.</font>

927
01:05:57,446 --> 01:05:58,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice shirt.</font>

928
01:05:59,363 --> 01:06:00,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silk?</font>

929
01:06:01,071 --> 01:06:02,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">On a policeman's salary?</font>

930
01:06:04,613 --> 01:06:07,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's paying you, Superintendent Grail?</font>

931
01:06:07,655 --> 01:06:10,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's paying you to kill match girls?</font>

932
01:06:10,113 --> 01:06:11,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Sarah Chapman?</font>

933
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:14,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know.
- She's a thief and a troublemaker.</font>

934
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:16,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want to risk your skin for her.</font>

935
01:06:19,488 --> 01:06:23,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if I can't find it out from you,
I'll find it out from someone else,</font>

936
01:06:23,238 --> 01:06:26,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">like her sister, little Bessie.</font>

937
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's just a little girl.</font>

938
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:31,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, but that's how it starts,
Enola Holmes!</font>

939
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:35,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">With little girls like her,
and you, and Sarah Chapman,</font>

940
01:06:35,821 --> 01:06:38,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">asking questions,
doubting those in charge,</font>

941
01:06:38,696 --> 01:06:40,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">not seeing their protection
for what it is,</font>

942
01:06:41,071 --> 01:06:42,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to tear it down.</font>

943
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:47,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it only takes one little flame
to start a fire,</font>

944
01:06:47,155 --> 01:06:50,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my job is to keep
crushing those bloody flames out.</font>

945
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:55,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I'll be kind</font>

946
01:06:55,696 --> 01:06:57,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">and give you one last chance.</font>

947
01:06:59,863 --> 01:07:00,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is she?</font>

948
01:07:02,363 --> 01:07:03,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

949
01:07:10,946 --> 01:07:12,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you're for the noose.</font>

950
01:07:12,988 --> 01:07:14,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some detective you were.</font>

951
01:07:16,071 --> 01:07:17,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should have stuck to needlework.</font>

952
01:07:31,571 --> 01:07:32,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir?</font>

953
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:34,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sir.
- Don't be ridi...</font>

954
01:07:37,863 --> 01:07:39,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Superintendent Grail.</font>

955
01:07:40,696 --> 01:07:42,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Holmes.</font>

956
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:45,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here for my sister.</font>

957
01:07:45,863 --> 01:07:47,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you can arrange her release,</font>

958
01:07:49,446 --> 01:07:50,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd much appreciate it.</font>

959
01:07:52,655 --> 01:07:54,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is my ward and a minor.</font>

960
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:55,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a murderer.</font>

961
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any evidence you think
you have against her...</font>

962
01:07:58,321 --> 01:07:59,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have plenty.</font>

963
01:08:00,905 --> 01:08:04,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was seen arguing with the victim,
following the victim,</font>

964
01:08:04,488 --> 01:08:08,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">fighting with the victim, and lastly,
standing over the victim's dead body.</font>

965
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:11,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when we find her there,
with blood on her hands,</font>

966
01:08:11,155 --> 01:08:12,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">she bloody runs.</font>

967
01:08:15,446 --> 01:08:16,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw your murder site.</font>

968
01:08:20,821 --> 01:08:24,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marks on and around the door
show that it was forced open,</font>

969
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:25,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">and recently.</font>

970
01:08:25,905 --> 01:08:27,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were signs of a scuffle</font>

971
01:08:27,321 --> 01:08:30,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">and boot marks
from three separate intruders.</font>

972
01:08:30,405 --> 01:08:31,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of them heavyset,</font>

973
01:08:32,655 --> 01:08:35,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">judging by the height and extent
of the subsequent damage.</font>

974
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Traces of fabric and spots of blood</font>

975
01:08:38,946 --> 01:08:42,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">suggests that there was
another occupant, likely female,</font>

976
01:08:42,863 --> 01:08:44,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">who seems to have fought back,</font>

977
01:08:44,613 --> 01:08:47,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">using a sharp and improvised weapon...</font>

978
01:08:50,946 --> 01:08:52,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">before escaping through the window.</font>

979
01:08:52,905 --> 01:08:55,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was a targeted
search and interrogation</font>

980
01:08:55,238 --> 01:08:57,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">in which two women were discovered,</font>

981
01:08:57,405 --> 01:08:59,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then my sister arrived,</font>

982
01:09:00,405 --> 01:09:03,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you were curiously fast
to arrive after her.</font>

983
01:09:03,655 --> 01:09:06,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, are you going to release her,
or shall I?</font>

984
01:09:09,363 --> 01:09:12,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sergeant Beeston, if you please.
- Sir.</font>

985
01:09:13,905 --> 01:09:15,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fingerprint matching.</font>

986
01:09:15,488 --> 01:09:17,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">New invention, Swiss.</font>

987
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:20,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You have heard of it?
- I have.</font>

988
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you care to look?</font>

989
01:09:24,821 --> 01:09:27,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makes our work so much more efficient,</font>

990
01:09:28,155 --> 01:09:29,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">especially in a murder case.</font>

991
01:09:36,363 --> 01:09:38,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sister never touched that weapon.</font>

992
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:41,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why are her prints on it?</font>

993
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a great age we live in,
isn't it, Mr. Holmes?</font>

994
01:10:13,071 --> 01:10:15,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you any sense
what time it is?</font>

995
01:10:16,363 --> 01:10:19,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello, Edith.
- You're lucky, I almost broke your legs.</font>

996
01:10:20,405 --> 01:10:22,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I recognized the shoulders.</font>

997
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:25,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You have very recognizable shoulders.
- Enola's been arrested.</font>

998
01:10:27,446 --> 01:10:28,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">For why?</font>

999
01:10:29,321 --> 01:10:30,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murder.</font>

1000
01:10:32,905 --> 01:10:34,863
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What she's got tangled with,</i></font>

1001
01:10:35,446 --> 01:10:37,363
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>it may go wider than I thought.</i></font>

1002
01:10:39,696 --> 01:10:41,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there's something
about this case that...</font>

1003
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deduction alone will not solve?</font>

1004
01:10:47,905 --> 01:10:50,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may need your...</font>

1005
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:54,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need your help.</font>

1006
01:10:56,571 --> 01:10:58,321
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We need your help.</i></font>

1007
01:10:58,863 --> 01:11:01,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exercise for 15 minutes.</font>

1008
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:04,113
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Well, like my mother always said,</i></font>

1009
01:11:04,196 --> 01:11:06,530
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>"Those who can turn to others

1010
01:11:06,613 --> 01:11:08,530

1011
01:11:09,363 --> 01:11:11,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother sounds very different to mine.</font>

1012
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:24,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did try to stop her,</font>

1013
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:27,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">but she's full of this fight.</font>

1014
01:11:30,613 --> 01:11:32,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">There we go. Finally.</font>

1015
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,655
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You can't control Enola Holmes.</i></font>

1016
01:11:34,738 --> 01:11:37,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a force of nature,</font>

1017
01:11:37,821 --> 01:11:38,946
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>a law unto herself.</i></font>

1018
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:40,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go easy on her, girls.</font>

1019
01:11:43,113 --> 01:11:44,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, she is.</font>

1020
01:11:46,113 --> 01:11:47,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I fear she will hang.</font>

1021
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm?</font>

1022
01:12:19,488 --> 01:12:20,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, girls!</font>

1023
01:12:22,863 --> 01:12:23,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">In there.</font>

1024
01:12:25,488 --> 01:12:26,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Tis I.</font>

1025
01:12:28,863 --> 01:12:30,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yah!</font>

1026
01:12:32,571 --> 01:12:33,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it is good to see you.</font>

1027
01:12:34,696 --> 01:12:35,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yah!</font>

1028
01:12:35,988 --> 01:12:37,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on!</font>

1029
01:12:41,196 --> 01:12:42,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yah!</font>

1030
01:12:44,613 --> 01:12:46,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're onto us!</font>

1031
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:49,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yah!
- Be ready in there!</font>

1032
01:12:51,155 --> 01:12:53,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this case of yours, how's it going?</font>

1033
01:12:53,321 --> 01:12:54,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

1034
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:57,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was trying to help a girl find
her sister, and I've made things worse.</font>

1035
01:12:57,488 --> 01:12:58,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nonsense.</font>

1036
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:01,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stirred up a hornet's nest.
You are onto something.</font>

1037
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:05,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Standby!
- Why else would they try and silence you?</font>

1038
01:13:07,321 --> 01:13:09,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, it's completely harmless.</font>

1039
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- On your left!
- My left or yours?</font>

1040
01:13:14,863 --> 01:13:15,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yours!</font>

1041
01:13:33,113 --> 01:13:35,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">This match factory,
what do you know about it?</font>

1042
01:13:35,613 --> 01:13:36,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a roaring success.</font>

1043
01:13:37,071 --> 01:13:39,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">In two years, it's doubled its profits.</font>

1044
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And now there's typhus.
- Typhus?</font>

1045
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:44,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, the girls are going down with it.
They're dying.</font>

1046
01:13:45,446 --> 01:13:46,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a loose thread.</font>

1047
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:48,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- They're back!</font>

1048
01:13:48,863 --> 01:13:49,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yah!</font>

1049
01:13:50,738 --> 01:13:53,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here they come! Brace yourselves!</font>

1050
01:14:01,488 --> 01:14:03,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know about these factories.</font>

1051
01:14:03,321 --> 01:14:04,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, come on!</font>

1052
01:14:04,863 --> 01:14:06,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls like Sarah Chapman,
they're expendable.</font>

1053
01:14:07,071 --> 01:14:09,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">They go missing,
too often they die, no one cares.</font>

1054
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:12,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this girl, they care about.
And greatly.</font>

1055
01:14:12,905 --> 01:14:14,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what does she know?</font>

1056
01:14:14,405 --> 01:14:16,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up here now!</font>

1057
01:14:16,488 --> 01:14:18,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">She stole something. Some papers.</font>

1058
01:14:18,571 --> 01:14:22,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aha! So what's she gonna do with them?
What's her plan? She's not a thief.</font>

1059
01:14:22,821 --> 01:14:26,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not a blackmailer.
She is a troublemaker.</font>

1060
01:14:26,405 --> 01:14:28,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">She knows something,</font>

1061
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:30,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that is infinitely more dangerous.</font>

1062
01:14:31,405 --> 01:14:32,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, lads!</font>

1063
01:14:39,321 --> 01:14:41,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stand by to the right!
- Would you mind?</font>

1064
01:14:41,905 --> 01:14:43,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait for it.
- W-W-Where?</font>

1065
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:45,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait for it!
- Straight.</font>

1066
01:14:46,071 --> 01:14:47,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now!</font>

1067
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:50,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get it out!
Get it out of here!</font>

1068
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:06,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, whatever Sarah's hiding, Enola,</font>

1069
01:15:07,655 --> 01:15:08,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's a secret.</font>

1070
01:15:10,946 --> 01:15:13,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to look
for what she knows, Enola.</font>

1071
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:18,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find that out,
and everything else will follow.</font>

1072
01:15:20,696 --> 01:15:22,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's probably under your nose.</font>

1073
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Huh?
- Get down!</font>

1074
01:15:28,155 --> 01:15:29,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's just rude.</font>

1075
01:15:32,071 --> 01:15:33,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grail.</font>

1076
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:40,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right, Edith?</font>

1077
01:15:40,321 --> 01:15:41,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just about! Yah!</font>

1078
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:49,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yah!</font>

1079
01:15:56,238 --> 01:15:57,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yah!</font>

1080
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:00,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, for goodness sake!</font>

1081
01:16:06,655 --> 01:16:07,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

1082
01:16:18,988 --> 01:16:19,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not good.</font>

1083
01:16:20,071 --> 01:16:21,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get 'em to the bank!</font>

1084
01:16:22,905 --> 01:16:24,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right? You all right?</font>

1085
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:27,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right?
- I'm all right, yeah.</font>

1086
01:16:28,821 --> 01:16:29,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh no.</font>

1087
01:16:29,946 --> 01:16:30,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir.</font>

1088
01:16:35,446 --> 01:16:36,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glory be.</font>

1089
01:16:37,863 --> 01:16:38,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the Holy Trinity.</font>

1090
01:16:41,946 --> 01:16:43,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make commissioner for this.</font>

1091
01:16:44,946 --> 01:16:45,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take 'em.</font>

1092
01:16:47,821 --> 01:16:48,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must we?</font>

1093
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:49,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fear so.</font>

1115
01:18:07,655 --> 01:18:09,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How are the kidneys?
- Fine.</font>

1116
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:10,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I quite enjoyed it.</font>

1117
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:14,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm. You enjoy everything.
It's most irritating.</font>

1118
01:18:14,655 --> 01:18:16,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, this way.
Better get a move on.</font>

1119
01:18:16,863 --> 01:18:17,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

1120
01:18:19,988 --> 01:18:23,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, um, how's that useless boy of yours?</font>

1121
01:18:25,488 --> 01:18:26,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear he's doing good work.</font>

1122
01:18:29,155 --> 01:18:30,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He is.
- Uh-huh.</font>

1123
01:18:31,655 --> 01:18:34,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well then,
perhaps not so useless after all.</font>

1124
01:18:35,905 --> 01:18:38,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't say he's "my boy."</font>

1125
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:46,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I sometimes think
I brought you up to be too independent.</font>

1126
01:18:47,071 --> 01:18:49,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mother!
- I did it with all of you.</font>

1127
01:18:49,321 --> 01:18:53,488

1130
01:18:59,571 --> 01:19:03,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, well, perhaps a little lonely.</font>

1131
01:19:06,071 --> 01:19:08,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will do very well on your own, Enola.</font>

1132
01:19:08,946 --> 01:19:13,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">But with others, you could be magnificent.</font>

1133
01:19:15,905 --> 01:19:19,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who do you think
organized all of this after all? Hm?</font>

1134
01:19:19,905 --> 01:19:20,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me?</font>

1135
01:19:23,321 --> 01:19:25,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you find your allies.</font>

1136
01:19:26,405 --> 01:19:29,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Work with them,
and you will become more of who you are.</font>

1137
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:32,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">You speak with one voice,</font>

1138
01:19:33,113 --> 01:19:36,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you will make more noise
than you could ever have imagined.</font>

1139
01:19:38,446 --> 01:19:42,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. She should go.
We'll put them off her scent.</font>

1140
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you dust yourself down...</font>

1141
01:19:49,363 --> 01:19:50,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">keep facing forward.</font>

1142
01:19:52,530 --> 01:19:55,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you ever get condemned
for murder again, you give me a shout.</font>

1143
01:19:56,696 --> 01:19:57,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will.</font>

1144
01:20:02,155 --> 01:20:03,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Edith.</font>

1145
01:20:08,446 --> 01:20:09,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful.</font>

1146
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:26,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">And get a haircut.</font>

1147
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:27,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a mess.</font>

1148
01:20:30,405 --> 01:20:31,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think my hair is fine.</font>

1149
01:20:45,113 --> 01:20:46,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1150
01:20:51,238 --> 01:20:52,863
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I need you to pack your things.</i></font>

1151
01:20:52,946 --> 01:20:55,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to be in a safer place.</font>

1152
01:20:55,238 --> 01:20:57,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is... Is my sister gone?</font>

1153
01:20:57,946 --> 01:20:59,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Like Mae?
- No.</font>

1154
01:20:59,613 --> 01:21:00,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is she...
- No.</font>

1155
01:21:00,863 --> 01:21:02,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure she's all right.</font>

1156
01:21:02,446 --> 01:21:04,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm closer to finding her.</font>

1157
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:07,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doris,</font>

1158
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:09,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">she'll take me in.</font>

1159
01:21:10,321 --> 01:21:12,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's got a spare bed now.</font>

1160
01:21:13,946 --> 01:21:14,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her sister?</font>

1161
01:21:16,321 --> 01:21:17,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead.</font>

1162
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:18,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Typhus.</font>

1163
01:21:23,363 --> 01:21:24,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead.</font>

1164
01:21:36,321 --> 01:21:38,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's traces of something in this soil.</font>

1165
01:21:41,113 --> 01:21:42,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">One has red, and one has white in it.</font>

1166
01:21:46,446 --> 01:21:50,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">The matches you make,
when did they change from red to white?</font>

1167
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dunno. Around two years ago.</font>

1168
01:21:52,738 --> 01:21:58,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">In two years, he's turned red into black.
Or should I say red into white?</font>

1169
01:21:59,155 --> 01:22:00,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Typhus.
The plague of our times.</font>

1170
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:03,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two years it's been killing these girls.</font>

1171
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:24,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out.</font>

1172
01:22:25,655 --> 01:22:26,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you looking at?</font>

1173
01:23:00,905 --> 01:23:01,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need your help.</font>

1174
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't make me repeat it! May I come in?</font>

1175
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:11,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Firstly, I would like to apologize
for so much.</font>

1176
01:23:11,655 --> 01:23:14,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have failed
to see allies in plain sight.</font>

1177
01:23:14,196 --> 01:23:15,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And I have...
- Enola.</font>

1178
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something I wish to say too.</font>

1179
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:19,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right.
- If you'd just...</font>

1180
01:23:25,196 --> 01:23:29,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">All day, every day,
all I do is compromise.</font>

1181
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:33,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I vote for this lord's bill that will
allow him to pump bilge water into a lake,</font>

1182
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:35,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">then he will vote for my forestry reform.</font>

1183
01:23:35,696 --> 01:23:39,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to stand up and say,
"This isn't right," but I have no allies.</font>

1184
01:23:39,905 --> 01:23:42,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">So to do so
would be to risk all that is good,</font>

1185
01:23:42,613 --> 01:23:45,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I lie awake trying to work out
which path to follow,</font>

1186
01:23:46,196 --> 01:23:47,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">alone.</font>

1187
01:23:48,863 --> 01:23:50,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no search for a wife,</font>

1188
01:23:51,405 --> 01:23:54,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">because politics consumes me constantly.</font>

1189
01:23:57,655 --> 01:23:59,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the speech I stored up for you.</font>

1190
01:24:02,905 --> 01:24:03,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a good man.</font>

1191
01:24:05,196 --> 01:24:06,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a man now?</font>

1192
01:24:06,613 --> 01:24:07,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">On occasion.</font>

1193
01:24:08,446 --> 01:24:11,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I understand your struggle,
because I struggle too.</font>

1194
01:24:12,321 --> 01:24:14,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am sorry we cannot talk more,
because I have...</font>

1195
01:24:14,363 --> 01:24:16,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">A case to solve?</font>

1196
01:24:20,696 --> 01:24:22,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girl I'm looking for, Sarah Chapman,</font>

1197
01:24:23,821 --> 01:24:25,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">she has proof that girls are dying</font>

1198
01:24:25,655 --> 01:24:27,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the phosphorus
they work with every day.</font>

1199
01:24:28,071 --> 01:24:31,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the factory
are trying to cover it up as typhus.</font>

1200
01:24:32,613 --> 01:24:33,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">She knows it,</font>

1201
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:36,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">and someone is going to kill her for it.</font>

1202
01:24:36,946 --> 01:24:38,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then what can we do?</font>

1203
01:24:40,363 --> 01:24:41,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">We?</font>

1204
01:24:47,363 --> 01:24:50,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't open it. It could be the police.
- You're still wanted by the police?</font>

1205
01:24:50,446 --> 01:24:52,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Of course. I escaped jail.
- You escaped?</font>

1206
01:24:52,696 --> 01:24:53,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget I told you that.</font>

1207
01:24:55,446 --> 01:24:58,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lights are on. If I don't answer,
they'll suspect more. Hide.</font>

1208
01:24:58,613 --> 01:25:00,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coming.</font>

1209
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:04,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Miss Cicely.
- I'm sorry it's so late.</font>

1210
01:25:04,738 --> 01:25:08,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, not at all.
I-I told you to come. I-I want to help.</font>

1211
01:25:08,488 --> 01:25:10,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is anyone else here?
- No.</font>

1212
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:11,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Um...
- Good.</font>

1213
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:15,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better we are alone, for it is imperative
that I speak with you.</font>

1214
01:25:15,988 --> 01:25:18,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, I feel that you're a man
of great character</font>

1215
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:19,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that I can trust you.</font>

1216
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:23,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why I fear I may have to unburden
myself, and it may prove shocking.</font>

1217
01:25:23,863 --> 01:25:24,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Cicely...</font>

1218
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:29,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just, I've been wanting
to speak with you about... a relationship.</font>

1219
01:25:29,155 --> 01:25:32,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that. Yes. Uh, perhaps
we can discuss this another time?</font>

1220
01:25:33,488 --> 01:25:34,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, sir.</font>

1221
01:25:34,405 --> 01:25:37,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm terribly sorry. Let me assure you,
I do share your interest.</font>

1222
01:25:37,863 --> 01:25:40,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We will talk again.
- Thank you.</font>

1223
01:25:43,321 --> 01:25:45,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's gone. She was flustered.</font>

1224
01:25:48,488 --> 01:25:51,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not think of doubting me.
Cicely was here for my help.</font>

1225
01:25:51,905 --> 01:25:55,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">She told me at the ball that she's working
on a bill to change factory law.</font>

1226
01:25:56,363 --> 01:25:58,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's unearthed something,
some corruption or other.</font>

1227
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:00,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's doing what?</font>

1228
01:26:05,321 --> 01:26:09,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enola, if you have any concerns,
I tell you categorically, I...</font>

1229
01:26:09,238 --> 01:26:10,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no eyes for anyone, but...</font>

1230
01:26:12,571 --> 01:26:14,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, no, this is not
quite how I wanted to say that.</font>

1231
01:26:15,738 --> 01:26:18,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">But to say,
in terms of romantic interests,</font>

1232
01:26:19,113 --> 01:26:21,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">yes, my interest is...</font>

1233
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:24,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">The reason I don't have to search,
I'm busy with politics, like I said...</font>

1234
01:26:24,571 --> 01:26:26,011
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You admire Lord Tewkesbury?</i></font>

1235
01:26:26,071 --> 01:26:28,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear he is a good man
and a great reformer.</font>

1236
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:31,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">The woman I would be most interested in...</font>

1237
01:26:31,238 --> 01:26:32,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mustn't lose my chance.</font>

1238
01:26:33,946 --> 01:26:34,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not listening.</font>

1239
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:36,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening, Lord Tewkesbury.</font>

1240
01:26:36,905 --> 01:26:38,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">She didn't have a chaperone.</font>

1241
01:26:40,863 --> 01:26:43,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got five seconds
to tell me why you're here.</font>

1242
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:45,321
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I have been blind!</i></font>

1243
01:26:45,405 --> 01:26:48,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">The phosphorus in the match-making
has mixed with oxygen.</font>

1244
01:26:49,196 --> 01:26:50,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have missed everything.</font>

1245
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:52,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's probably under your nose.</font>

1246
01:26:55,571 --> 01:26:56,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cicely.</font>

1247
01:27:05,488 --> 01:27:07,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah is Cicely.</font>

1248
01:27:09,405 --> 01:27:11,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cicely is Sarah!</font>

1249
01:27:11,905 --> 01:27:13,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enola!</font>

1250
01:27:13,738 --> 01:27:15,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enola, what on Earth...</font>

1251
01:27:17,488 --> 01:27:19,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enola, did you understand what I said?</font>

1252
01:27:20,113 --> 01:27:24,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or rather what I didn't say?
Did you understand... what I didn't say?</font>

1253
01:27:24,196 --> 01:27:26,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. You were saying that you...</font>

1254
01:27:34,863 --> 01:27:35,946
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You'll learn.</i></font>

1255
01:27:37,071 --> 01:27:40,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">That message
you sent me with the fan at the ball,</font>

1256
01:27:40,946 --> 01:27:41,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">what did it mean?</font>

1257
01:27:45,696 --> 01:27:46,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means I love you.</font>

1258
01:27:55,113 --> 01:27:58,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen,
to the future.</font>

1259
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:03,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

1260
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:08,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were working together, in love.</font>

1261
01:28:09,488 --> 01:28:10,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">They had a plan.</font>

1262
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:16,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">To expose the corruption in that factory
and stop what his father was doing.</font>

1263
01:28:17,405 --> 01:28:18,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">They wanted your help.</font>

1264
01:28:18,738 --> 01:28:20,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">William Lyon invited you to that ball.</font>

1265
01:28:20,946 --> 01:28:22,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a radical just like you.</font>

1266
01:28:23,155 --> 01:28:25,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">They needed my help. You're right.</font>

1267
01:28:25,988 --> 01:28:27,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Enola, we must return inside.</font>

1268
01:28:27,863 --> 01:28:30,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">The police are pursuing you,
and we have much to talk of.</font>

1269
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:32,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! I know we have much to talk of,
my dear, dear lord.</font>

1270
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:34,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">You love me.</font>

1271
01:28:34,238 --> 01:28:36,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as it turns out, I love you too.</font>

1272
01:28:37,613 --> 01:28:38,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">You love me too?</font>

1273
01:28:41,071 --> 01:28:42,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really are a nincompoop.</font>

1274
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:46,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now hail a cab.</font>

1275
01:28:57,113 --> 01:29:00,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shh. You're walking loudly.
- But it's gravel.</font>

1276
01:29:00,988 --> 01:29:03,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You've got large feet.
- I know.</font>

1277
01:29:08,321 --> 01:29:10,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait here. Keep guard.</font>

1278
01:29:10,655 --> 01:29:12,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anyone comes,
just tell them you're a lord.</font>

1279
01:29:13,738 --> 01:29:14,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a lord.</font>

1280
01:29:15,321 --> 01:29:16,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then they'll likely believe you.</font>

1281
01:29:17,613 --> 01:29:18,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

1282
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:11,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">You.</font>

1283
01:30:13,488 --> 01:30:15,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How ridiculous you are.
- I'm ridiculous?</font>

1284
01:30:15,863 --> 01:30:18,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you to stay safe and stay away.</font>

1285
01:30:18,113 --> 01:30:20,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you're breaking out of prison
and have the police after you.</font>

1286
01:30:21,321 --> 01:30:24,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Are you hurt? I am sorry.</font>

1287
01:30:24,238 --> 01:30:25,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you not hurt?</font>

1288
01:30:27,238 --> 01:30:28,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems not.</font>

1289
01:30:29,155 --> 01:30:30,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

1290
01:30:30,488 --> 01:30:32,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder who taught you
to fight like that.</font>

1291
01:30:33,363 --> 01:30:35,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another thing our mother
has to answer for.</font>

1292
01:30:35,196 --> 01:30:37,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">She should have fed me as well as you
is what I think.</font>

1293
01:30:38,655 --> 01:30:41,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on. Why are you here?
Is it my case, or your own?</font>

1294
01:30:42,071 --> 01:30:45,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both. I know how Grail
got your fingerprints.</font>

1295
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:47,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oxidized phosphorus dust</font>

1296
01:30:48,363 --> 01:30:50,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">lifted from the table
and applied to the knife.</font>

1297
01:30:51,821 --> 01:30:52,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're innocent.</font>

1298
01:30:53,946 --> 01:30:55,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">You doubted it?</font>

1299
01:30:55,821 --> 01:30:57,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing's certain till it's proved.</font>

1300
01:30:59,446 --> 01:31:00,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your case?</font>

1301
01:31:01,030 --> 01:31:03,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">My adversary, his trail,</font>

1302
01:31:03,821 --> 01:31:04,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">it leads here.</font>

1303
01:31:06,905 --> 01:31:08,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems our cases are connected.</font>

1304
01:31:11,113 --> 01:31:11,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we?</font>

1305
01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:45,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">William Lyon.</font>

1306
01:31:46,905 --> 01:31:48,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah's love.</font>

1307
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:50,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my thief in a taper crown hat.</font>

1308
01:31:57,488 --> 01:32:01,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay unemotional. There's nothing more
we can do for him now.</font>

1309
01:32:01,738 --> 01:32:04,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Need to keep our minds fresh
and our eyes sharp.</font>

1310
01:32:04,905 --> 01:32:06,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was seized.</font>

1311
01:32:07,613 --> 01:32:10,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, and searched.
- For the document he took?</font>

1312
01:32:11,863 --> 01:32:12,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">A knife?</font>

1313
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, bigger.</font>

1314
01:32:15,863 --> 01:32:16,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">A cutlass.</font>

1315
01:32:18,946 --> 01:32:20,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heavy boot scuffs,</font>

1316
01:32:21,655 --> 01:32:24,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">and scratch marks from a cane
that has a metal ferrule.</font>

1317
01:32:26,113 --> 01:32:27,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grail.</font>

1318
01:32:28,321 --> 01:32:29,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">But at whose behest?</font>

1319
01:32:30,946 --> 01:32:32,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was another in this room.</font>

1320
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:34,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">This cigar had a holder.</font>

1321
01:32:38,071 --> 01:32:39,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">And traces of wool.</font>

1322
01:32:42,113 --> 01:32:44,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Astrakhan, the finest.</font>

1323
01:32:44,738 --> 01:32:49,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Lord Mclntyre,
if I, um, might suggest a little lunch.</font>

1324
01:32:50,446 --> 01:32:53,196
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Leave me be, please.
They're watching.</i></font>

1325
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:58,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did William steal from?</font>

1326
01:32:58,571 --> 01:33:00,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Treasury Office?
- Yes.</font>

1327
01:33:00,696 --> 01:33:03,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">The office of Lord Mclntyre,
Treasury Minister.</font>

1328
01:33:03,946 --> 01:33:05,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you come to that?</font>

1329
01:33:06,405 --> 01:33:08,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think what William stole was proof</font>

1330
01:33:08,613 --> 01:33:11,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Lyon and Mclntyre
were conspiring together.</font>

1331
01:33:12,613 --> 01:33:14,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Corruption.
- Yes.</font>

1332
01:33:14,321 --> 01:33:16,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fueled by greed.</font>

1333
01:33:16,738 --> 01:33:20,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mclntyre has been secretly profiting
from the factory.</font>

1334
01:33:20,196 --> 01:33:23,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">They changed the match formula
to a cheaper phosphorus,</font>

1335
01:33:24,571 --> 01:33:25,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's deadly.</font>

1336
01:33:26,363 --> 01:33:27,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enola?</font>

1337
01:33:27,321 --> 01:33:28,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enola, I was concerned for you.</font>

1338
01:33:28,946 --> 01:33:31,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">You left me out there in the dark,
and I nearly tore my...</font>

1339
01:33:35,238 --> 01:33:37,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sherlock Holmes? How do...
- Not the time.</font>

1340
01:33:39,446 --> 01:33:40,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh my...</font>

1341
01:33:41,696 --> 01:33:43,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is he...
- Stay unemotional.</font>

1342
01:33:44,863 --> 01:33:47,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who did this?
- Lord Mclntyre.</font>

1343
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:49,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- But it all fits.</font>

1344
01:33:49,905 --> 01:33:53,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one has sat in this chair.
No marks on the carpet, no indentation.</font>

01:33:53,196 --> 01:33:56,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cigar has been smoked, but cold.</font>

1346
01:33:57,155 --> 01:33:59,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">And look, no ash.</font>

1347
01:34:01,905 --> 01:34:04,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No lips have touched that glass.
- Exactly.</font>

1348
01:34:04,655 --> 01:34:07,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">These clues
have been planted for us to find,</font>

1349
01:34:07,738 --> 01:34:09,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">to mislead us from the true villain.</font>

1350
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">This has all been staged.</font>

1351
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">By who?</font>

1352
01:34:14,863 --> 01:34:18,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not Mclntyre, but by someone who had
a lot to lose without that document.</font>

1353
01:34:19,071 --> 01:34:22,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone who knew what they were up to
and was blackmailing them.</font>

1354
01:34:23,405 --> 01:34:24,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">My opponent.</font>

1355
01:34:27,238 --> 01:34:28,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone who likes a game.</font>

1356
01:34:30,863 --> 01:34:34,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did they get what they wanted?
- No, I don't think so.</font>

1357
01:34:36,988 --> 01:34:37,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor William.</font>

1358
01:34:47,738 --> 01:34:48,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

1359
01:34:55,446 --> 01:34:58,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They did get something.
- Mae's terrible music.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">"The Truth of the Gods."</font>

1361
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:02,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could be biblical, mythical.</font>

1362
01:35:02,863 --> 01:35:03,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theatrical?</font>

1363
01:35:07,446 --> 01:35:10,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Gods is the top row of the theater.</font>

1364
01:35:10,863 --> 01:35:11,863
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The balcony.</i></font>

1365
01:35:12,946 --> 01:35:14,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't everyone know that?</font>

1366
01:35:16,113 --> 01:35:17,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't music.</font>

1367
01:35:26,155 --> 01:35:27,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a map.</font>

1368
01:35:36,988 --> 01:35:39,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just to be clear
as to what we might be about to face...</font>

1369
01:35:40,988 --> 01:35:43,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">There may be some violence.
You've faced it before.</font>

1370
01:35:44,488 --> 01:35:45,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1371
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:47,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did have part of a suit of armor on.</font>

1372
01:35:48,321 --> 01:35:51,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">But yes, fighting will be...</font>

1373
01:35:52,488 --> 01:35:53,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1374
01:35:53,405 --> 01:35:55,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You've been in a fight before?
- Yes, plenty of fights.</font>

1375
01:35:55,863 --> 01:35:56,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fenced for my school.</font>

1376
01:35:57,905 --> 01:35:58,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

1377
01:36:02,488 --> 01:36:04,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. Can you teach me to fight?</font>

1378
01:36:05,405 --> 01:36:07,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, right now? In a carriage?</font>

1379
01:36:07,946 --> 01:36:10,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I not teach you to dance
in five minutes in a bathroom?</font>

1380
01:36:12,113 --> 01:36:14,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Fine.</font>

1381
01:36:18,196 --> 01:36:21,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are two secrets to fighting.
Avoid the punch, make the counterpunch.</font>

1382
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see how two secrets... Ow!</font>

1383
01:36:26,071 --> 01:36:27,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your first lesson.</font>

1384
01:36:27,488 --> 01:36:28,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow.</font>

1385
01:36:29,446 --> 01:36:30,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

1386
01:36:30,488 --> 01:36:32,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your second. You didn't avoid the punch.</font>

1387
01:36:32,696 --> 01:36:35,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can hardly expect me to hit a girl.
- Oh dear.</font>

1388
01:36:35,946 --> 01:36:36,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not some... Ow!</font>

1389
01:36:37,655 --> 01:36:38,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow! Will you stop that?</font>

1390
01:36:39,488 --> 01:36:41,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't stop.</font>

1391
01:36:42,613 --> 01:36:45,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're approaching.</font>

1392
01:37:11,446 --> 01:37:13,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may need more of those lessons.</font>

1393
01:37:38,613 --> 01:37:40,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">X marks the spot.</font>

1394
01:37:59,821 --> 01:38:00,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah.</font>

1395
01:38:03,613 --> 01:38:04,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all there.</font>

1396
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the proof we need.</font>

1397
01:38:09,488 --> 01:38:12,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">The contract
between Lyon and Mclntyre</font>

1398
01:38:13,571 --> 01:38:15,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">to change the phosphorus.</font>

1399
01:38:17,405 --> 01:38:19,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">What William stole for you.</font>

1400
01:38:24,196 --> 01:38:27,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the pages from the factory register.</font>

1401
01:38:27,655 --> 01:38:29,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you stole from the office.</font>

1402
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:33,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are the names
of the girls they killed.</font>

1403
01:38:33,446 --> 01:38:35,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't let 'em be forgotten.</font>

1404
01:38:37,155 --> 01:38:40,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's proof that match girls
are dying from working in that factory,</font>

1405
01:38:41,488 --> 01:38:42,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they knew it all along.</font>

1406
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:47,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a bloody good detective,
Enola Holmes.</font>

1407
01:38:49,738 --> 01:38:51,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are too, Sarah Chapman.</font>

1408
01:38:55,446 --> 01:38:57,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will share this with the world,
I promise you.</font>

1409
01:38:59,905 --> 01:39:00,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1410
01:39:02,321 --> 01:39:05,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we must find William.
He was supposed to meet me six hours ago.</font>

1411
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:10,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid William won't be coming.</font>

1412
01:39:15,863 --> 01:39:16,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1413
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:21,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

1414
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:24,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry.</font>

1415
01:39:30,071 --> 01:39:32,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told him we had everything we needed.</font>

1416
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">That we should just go public.</font>

1417
01:39:37,655 --> 01:39:41,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said nobody would care unless we had
someone in power who would listen.</font>

1418
01:39:44,488 --> 01:39:46,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was just trying to keep me safe.</font>

1419
01:39:48,946 --> 01:39:50,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now I've lost him.</font>

1420
01:39:50,821 --> 01:39:53,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">We must move quickly,
or we'll lose you too.</font>

1421
01:39:54,113 --> 01:39:55,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Losing this...</font>

1422
01:39:58,488 --> 01:39:59,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">losing that.</font>

1423
01:40:03,488 --> 01:40:05,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Seems you've lost everything.
- Bessie!</font>

1424
01:40:06,196 --> 01:40:08,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've all been very careless.</font>

1425
01:40:14,113 --> 01:40:15,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take those.</font>

1426
01:40:15,155 --> 01:40:16,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let go of her.</font>

1427
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:20,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the papers and I will.</font>

1428
01:40:35,905 --> 01:40:37,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run, Bessie!</font>

1429
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:46,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't just stand there!</font>

1430
01:40:51,530 --> 01:40:53,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

1431
01:40:53,488 --> 01:40:56,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get after them!</font>

1432
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:14,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow.</font>

1433
01:41:20,196 --> 01:41:21,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Avoid the punch, make the counterpunch.</font>

1434
01:41:44,946 --> 01:41:45,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tewkesbury!</font>

1435
01:42:47,071 --> 01:42:48,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Argh!</font>

1436
01:42:48,363 --> 01:42:49,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Argh.</font>

1437
01:42:54,571 --> 01:42:55,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1438
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:07,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bessie!</font>

1439
01:43:08,738 --> 01:43:10,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run.</font>

1440
01:43:11,321 --> 01:43:12,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said run!</font>

1441
01:43:57,071 --> 01:43:58,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enola!</font>

1442
01:44:05,196 --> 01:44:08,155
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You got more to you than I thought.</i></font>

1443
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:15,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.</font>

1444
01:45:17,446 --> 01:45:19,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">What places we find ourselves in.</font>

1445
01:45:24,696 --> 01:45:26,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">What places indeed.</font>

1446
01:45:30,488 --> 01:45:32,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always loved the theater.</font>

1447
01:45:36,988 --> 01:45:37,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it?</font>

1448
01:45:37,905 --> 01:45:41,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to dream
I'd end up on the stage.</font>

1449
01:45:43,905 --> 01:45:45,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not rid of me yet,</font>

1450
01:45:45,196 --> 01:45:47,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Viscount Tewkesbury,
Marquess of Basilwether.</font>

1451
01:45:57,613 --> 01:45:59,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enola!</font>

1452
01:46:06,238 --> 01:46:07,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurrah!</font>

1453
01:46:18,863 --> 01:46:19,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you all right?</font>

1454
01:46:26,530 --> 01:46:27,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were made to fight.</font>

1455
01:46:39,530 --> 01:46:40,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations.</font>

1456
01:46:43,113 --> 01:46:45,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Mclntyre.
What are you doing here?</font>

1457
01:46:45,530 --> 01:46:47,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was summoned.</font>

1458
01:46:48,696 --> 01:46:52,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your brother knew that I would want
to see the right people shown justice.</font>

1459
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:54,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't know how to thank you</font>

1460
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:57,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">for retrieving this government property</font>

1461
01:46:57,405 --> 01:46:59,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, uh, bringing this killer to light.</font>

1462
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:03,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">A rot amongst our ranks.</font>

1463
01:47:06,196 --> 01:47:09,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world shall know
the name Enola Holmes,</font>

1464
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:10,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make sure of it.</font>

1465
01:47:12,530 --> 01:47:14,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lestrade, arrest that girl.</font>

1466
01:47:15,571 --> 01:47:17,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's done nothing wrong.</font>

1467
01:47:17,946 --> 01:47:19,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">On what charge, sir?</font>

1468
01:47:19,946 --> 01:47:23,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Theft.
- All she stole from you was the truth.</font>

1469
01:47:23,571 --> 01:47:25,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">She took personal information,</font>

1470
01:47:26,655 --> 01:47:30,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">which she used
for extortion and blackmail.</font>

1471
01:47:30,738 --> 01:47:33,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why she will serve her time.</font>

1472
01:47:33,946 --> 01:47:34,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

1473
01:47:36,988 --> 01:47:38,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you are mistaken.</font>

1474
01:47:39,196 --> 01:47:42,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was not your blackmailer.</font>

1475
01:47:42,571 --> 01:47:45,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">I summoned you here
to draw that very person out.</font>

1476
01:47:46,071 --> 01:47:47,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">The accounting was masterful.</font>

1477
01:47:48,530 --> 01:47:52,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">A tangle of roots,
but all pointed to one pocket.</font>

1478
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:57,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">One person
receiving the fruits of their schemes</font>

1479
01:47:57,488 --> 01:47:58,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">with no one noticing.</font>

1480
01:48:00,405 --> 01:48:03,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hearing everything, seeing everything.</font>

1481
01:48:04,821 --> 01:48:06,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ignored for years.</font>

1482
01:48:06,946 --> 01:48:08,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Playing them all.</font>

1483
01:48:09,738 --> 01:48:10,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all a game.</font>

1484
01:48:12,738 --> 01:48:15,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's fun, once you know the rules.</font>

1485
01:48:21,530 --> 01:48:22,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Mira Troy.</font>

1486
01:48:22,530 --> 01:48:24,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absurd.</font>

1487
01:48:25,571 --> 01:48:27,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't believe it.</font>

1488
01:48:28,530 --> 01:48:32,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's remarkable
what can be done</font>

1489
01:48:32,238 --> 01:48:35,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">when people underestimate you.</font>

1490
01:48:37,238 --> 01:48:38,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then came the problem.</font>

1491
01:48:39,905 --> 01:48:41,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">William stole the contract.</font>

1492
01:48:41,238 --> 01:48:43,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">He threatened to cut off your money train.</font>

1493
01:48:43,196 --> 01:48:44,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you couldn't have that.</font>

1494
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hired Grail to retrieve the document,</font>

1495
01:48:48,696 --> 01:48:50,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">but things got out of hand,</font>

1496
01:48:51,030 --> 01:48:53,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you tried to point us to Lord Mclntyre.</font>

1497
01:48:54,238 --> 01:48:56,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">A rare misstep in your game...</font>

1498
01:48:58,155 --> 01:48:59,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moriarty.</font>

1499
01:49:06,321 --> 01:49:10,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a shame our divertissement
has to end, Mr. Holmes.</font>

1500
01:49:12,113 --> 01:49:16,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was so enjoying it.</font>

1501
01:49:17,821 --> 01:49:20,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you, Enola.</font>

1502
01:49:21,530 --> 01:49:24,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Troy, you have been behind this?</font>

1503
01:49:25,946 --> 01:49:29,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, you never can find
the proper staff.</font>

1504
01:49:30,071 --> 01:49:31,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only wanted the agreements back.</font>

1505
01:49:32,738 --> 01:49:35,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though I couldn't be seen
to question William myself,</font>

1506
01:49:35,446 --> 01:49:37,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were so obliging.</font>

1507
01:49:39,113 --> 01:49:43,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wish to speak with William,
you could always try with that.</font>

1508
01:49:46,905 --> 01:49:51,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a pity he was smarter
and braver in the end than I'd expected.</font>

1509
01:49:51,155 --> 01:49:55,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">They both were.
Their deaths were so unnecessary.</font>

1510
01:49:56,321 --> 01:50:02,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Superintendent Grail
was somewhat of a blunt instrument.</font>

1511
01:50:03,571 --> 01:50:04,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">You!</font>

1512
01:50:05,071 --> 01:50:07,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare you take advantage
of your position!</font>

1513
01:50:10,863 --> 01:50:13,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take advantage?</font>

1514
01:50:14,905 --> 01:50:17,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">What were my advantages?</font>

1515
01:50:19,030 --> 01:50:22,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Treated like a common servant
when I have twice the mind of yours.</font>

1516
01:50:24,988 --> 01:50:26,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any of yours.</font>

1517
01:50:28,863 --> 01:50:32,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why shouldn't I have a share
of your ill-begotten riches</font>

1518
01:50:32,738 --> 01:50:35,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">and punish you at the same time?</font>

1519
01:50:36,238 --> 01:50:39,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why shouldn't I be rewarded
for what I can do?</font>

1520
01:50:40,821 --> 01:50:46,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is my place in this... society?</font>

1521
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:48,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a woman.</font>

1522
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:50,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot join clubs,</font>

1523
01:50:51,530 --> 01:50:52,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot own shares,</font>

1524
01:50:52,696 --> 01:50:55,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot advance myself as they can.</font>

1525
01:50:56,821 --> 01:50:57,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

1526
01:51:00,446 --> 01:51:03,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found my own way.</font>

1527
01:51:05,405 --> 01:51:10,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it was fun.</font>

1528
01:51:14,530 --> 01:51:15,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lestrade,</font>

1529
01:51:17,696 --> 01:51:19,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">take her away.</font>

1530
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:20,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

1531
01:51:23,071 --> 01:51:24,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">On what charge, sir?</font>

1532
01:51:24,988 --> 01:51:26,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Extortion.
- Uh, yes, yes.</font>

1533
01:51:26,946 --> 01:51:27,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blackmail, murder.</font>

1534
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:29,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

1535
01:51:30,113 --> 01:51:33,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a shame our little dance has to end.</font>

1536
01:51:35,071 --> 01:51:36,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">For now at least.</font>

1537
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:38,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps we shall take to the floor again.</font>

1538
01:51:47,113 --> 01:51:48,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1539
01:51:48,821 --> 01:51:50,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1540
01:51:52,071 --> 01:51:54,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there. That's that then.</font>

1541
01:51:56,196 --> 01:51:59,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I accidentally burnt my own property.
What of it?</font>

1542
01:52:00,488 --> 01:52:03,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are corrupt, sir.</font>

1543
01:52:03,155 --> 01:52:05,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">And complicit in the deaths
of hundreds of match girls.</font>

1544
01:52:07,238 --> 01:52:08,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is your proof?</font>

1545
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:11,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

1546
01:52:11,405 --> 01:52:14,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">So... back to business.</font>

1547
01:52:16,321 --> 01:52:18,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sir, you cannot...
- Tewkesbury.</font>

1548
01:52:20,905 --> 01:52:21,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Patience.</font>

1549
01:52:28,863 --> 01:52:29,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glory be.</font>

1550
01:52:41,946 --> 01:52:44,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">All those names, those lives,</font>

1551
01:52:45,863 --> 01:52:46,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I failed 'em, Enola.</font>

1552
01:52:47,613 --> 01:52:48,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't say that.</font>

1553
01:52:50,488 --> 01:52:51,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mae gone...</font>

1554
01:52:54,405 --> 01:52:55,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">William gone,</font>

1555
01:52:56,821 --> 01:52:58,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they're gonna get away with it.</font>

1556
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:01,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard the man. "Where's your proof?"</font>

1557
01:53:03,321 --> 01:53:04,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we have now?</font>

1558
01:53:09,196 --> 01:53:10,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have each other...</font>

1559
01:53:13,613 --> 01:53:15,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we have the truth.</font>

1560
01:53:27,071 --> 01:53:29,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're late, Bess Chapman.
Docking you a penny.</font>

1561
01:53:32,655 --> 01:53:33,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oi.</font>

1562
01:53:35,030 --> 01:53:36,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not welcome here no more.</font>

1563
01:53:38,238 --> 01:53:40,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing? Oi!</font>

1564
01:53:40,738 --> 01:53:41,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get down.</font>

1565
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:43,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get down!</font>

1566
01:53:44,071 --> 01:53:45,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let her speak!</font>

1567
01:53:49,863 --> 01:53:51,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few weeks ago,</font>

1568
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:55,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mae Izley, William Lyon, and I</font>

1569
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:57,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">set out to prove something.</font>

1570
01:53:59,071 --> 01:54:01,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">To prove that this factory
was killing people,</font>

1571
01:54:02,821 --> 01:54:03,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they knew it.</font>

1572
01:54:04,071 --> 01:54:07,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they decided that profit
mattered more than we did.</font>

1573
01:54:08,946 --> 01:54:11,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're coming with me.
- Shh!</font>

1574
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:14,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">It ain't typhus that's killing us.
It's the phosphorus.</font>

1575
01:54:15,071 --> 01:54:16,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">What we work with every day.</font>

1576
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:19,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lying little toerag.</font>

1577
01:54:19,863 --> 01:54:21,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a penny off your wages!</font>

1578
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:25,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">These were our friends...</font>

1579
01:54:27,446 --> 01:54:28,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">our sisters...</font>

1580
01:54:33,821 --> 01:54:35,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">and our children.</font>

1581
01:54:36,905 --> 01:54:39,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it stops now.</font>

1582
01:54:41,488 --> 01:54:44,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time for us to use
the only thing we have. Ourselves.</font>

1583
01:54:45,530 --> 01:54:49,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time for us to refuse to work.</font>

1584
01:54:49,363 --> 01:54:51,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time to tell 'em no.</font>

1585
01:54:51,821 --> 01:54:53,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right, get back to work.
- No!</font>

1586
01:54:55,238 --> 01:54:57,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">You leave here, there is no coming back.</font>

1587
01:54:59,155 --> 01:55:01,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will not get employed here again.</font>

1588
01:55:02,905 --> 01:55:05,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, will you join me?</font>

1589
01:55:09,571 --> 01:55:11,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think of your families.</font>

1590
01:55:11,863 --> 01:55:13,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't do it, girls.</font>

1591
01:55:13,238 --> 01:55:15,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is not worth the risk.</font>

1592
01:55:16,405 --> 01:55:17,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well,</font>

1593
01:55:18,946 --> 01:55:19,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">will ya?</font>

1594
01:55:20,405 --> 01:55:22,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is how the world works.</font>

1595
01:55:23,655 --> 01:55:24,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, girls.</font>

1596
01:55:26,363 --> 01:55:28,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're scared. I am too.</font>

1597
01:55:28,655 --> 01:55:30,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's the only power we have!</font>

1598
01:55:37,821 --> 01:55:38,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right,</font>

1599
01:55:40,446 --> 01:55:42,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">get that machine back on
and get back to work.</font>

1600
01:55:49,863 --> 01:55:50,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

1601
01:55:54,196 --> 01:55:55,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1602
01:55:56,530 --> 01:55:58,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">This can't be their future.</font>

1603
01:55:59,238 --> 01:56:00,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Enola.</font>

1604
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:10,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop that.</font>

1605
01:56:19,113 --> 01:56:20,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop that.</font>

1606
01:56:25,988 --> 01:56:27,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be one voice.</font>

1607
01:56:31,488 --> 01:56:33,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough!</font>

1608
01:56:45,946 --> 01:56:46,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop that!</font>

1609
01:56:57,530 --> 01:56:59,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't anyone control these bloody women?</font>

1610
01:57:06,113 --> 01:57:07,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, girls.</font>

1611
01:57:44,946 --> 01:57:47,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where are you going?
- Westminster!</font>

1612
01:57:50,113 --> 01:57:51,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">There they go.</font>

1613
01:57:52,071 --> 01:57:53,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a whole lot of noise.</font>

1614
01:57:54,988 --> 01:57:56,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">She likes causing trouble, doesn't she?</font>

1615
01:57:57,530 --> 01:57:59,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's as if she was molded that way.</font>

1616
01:58:03,363 --> 01:58:04,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">She still needs that haircut.</font>

1617
01:58:15,113 --> 01:58:17,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems your boy has learned how to fight.</font>

1618
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:20,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Mclntyre.</font>

1619
01:58:25,363 --> 01:58:26,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Indeed.</font>

1620
01:58:27,405 --> 01:58:28,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not my boy.</font>

1621
01:58:35,113 --> 01:58:36,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Pay what you can."</font>

1622
01:58:37,321 --> 01:58:39,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what will people pay you in?
Potatoes and gratitude?</font>

1623
01:58:40,030 --> 01:58:41,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that's all they have.</font>

1624
01:58:41,446 --> 01:58:44,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can deal with the hoits and toits.
This is where I should be.</font>

1625
01:58:45,155 --> 01:58:47,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Edith said she'll be kind with the rent.</font>

1626
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:54,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you are aware, should you wish
some finer surrounds, I could, uh...</font>

1627
01:58:56,446 --> 01:58:57,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking...</font>

1628
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:01,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holmes and Holmes?</font>

1629
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:05,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">A partnership?</font>

1630
01:59:09,071 --> 01:59:11,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the kindest offer.</font>

1631
01:59:12,363 --> 01:59:15,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if I did that,
I would always be in your shadow.</font>

1632
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:17,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm. Yes.</font>

1633
01:59:21,863 --> 01:59:24,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though I do like this new version of you.</font>

1634
01:59:24,905 --> 01:59:26,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one should be alone all the time.</font>

1635
01:59:28,113 --> 01:59:29,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">A friend would do you well.</font>

1636
01:59:31,905 --> 01:59:33,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps I should write that down.</font>

1637
01:59:37,530 --> 01:59:39,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shall drop by to check on you.</font>

1638
01:59:40,071 --> 01:59:41,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like that.</font>

1639
01:59:41,946 --> 01:59:45,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you could come to Baker Street
from time to time...</font>

1640
01:59:47,238 --> 01:59:48,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">to check on me.</font>

1641
01:59:52,446 --> 01:59:56,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps we can fix on Thursday, 4 p.m.</font>

1642
01:59:56,946 --> 01:59:58,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thursday at 4:00 it is.</font>

1643
02:00:00,696 --> 02:00:03,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems I shan't be the last
to interrupt you today.</font>

1644
02:00:05,655 --> 02:00:06,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he has flowers.</font>

1645
02:00:09,530 --> 02:00:11,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sherlock.
- Tewkesbury.</font>

1646
02:00:11,780 --> 02:00:14,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See you on Thursday.
- Bye, Sherlock.</font>

1647
02:00:23,238 --> 02:00:24,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sherlock?
- Yes.</font>

1648
02:00:24,488 --> 02:00:25,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your paper.</font>

1649
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:27,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1650
02:00:27,696 --> 02:00:28,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">And...</font>

1651
02:00:30,155 --> 02:00:32,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">thank you... for everything.</font>

1652
02:00:51,738 --> 02:00:54,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tewkesbury, when did I give you
the impression that I like flowers?</font>

1653
02:00:54,821 --> 02:00:57,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're called Spreading Bellflowers.
Wild, of course.</font>

1654
02:00:58,071 --> 02:01:00,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Attracted to ancient woodland,
wiry, deceptive,</font>

1655
02:01:01,488 --> 02:01:03,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">refuse to behave according to any rules,</font>

1656
02:01:03,571 --> 02:01:07,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">but their petals are so delicate,
and their flowers...</font>

1657
02:01:08,071 --> 02:01:09,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two things.</font>

1658
02:01:09,113 --> 02:01:12,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your metaphor is tortured,
and I don't have delicate petals.</font>

1659
02:01:12,155 --> 02:01:13,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and, and, and...</font>

1660
02:01:14,946 --> 02:01:18,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is an invitation to a ball
being given by...</font>

1661
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:22,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I am not going to a ball with you.
I got arrested at the last one.</font>

1662
02:01:23,696 --> 02:01:26,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, all the more reason to dance again,
wouldn't you say?</font>

1663
02:01:26,988 --> 02:01:30,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're a nincompoop.
- And you are a coward.</font>

1664
02:01:30,196 --> 02:01:33,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare you speak to a lady
like that? You are a disgrace, sir.</font>

1665
02:01:33,155 --> 02:01:35,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet
you still hold my arm.</font>

1666
02:01:36,071 --> 02:01:37,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet I still hold your arm.</font>

1667
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:19,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sherlock Holmes?</font>

1668
02:02:20,196 --> 02:02:21,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1669
02:02:22,196 --> 02:02:23,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here for my appointment.</font>

1670
02:02:25,488 --> 02:02:26,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're seeking a flatmate?</font>

1671
02:02:28,030 --> 02:02:30,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You must have the wrong address.
- Really?</font>

1672
02:02:32,988 --> 02:02:35,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">The young lady was very clear
as to the place a-and the time.</font>

1673
02:02:37,238 --> 02:02:39,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Thursday at 4:00," she said.</font>

1674
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:41,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You are Sherlock Holmes?
- Hm.</font>

1675
02:02:42,738 --> 02:02:43,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1676
02:02:44,821 --> 02:02:46,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, do come in, Mr...?</font>

1677
02:02:46,905 --> 02:02:47,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doctor.</font>

1678
02:02:48,821 --> 02:02:49,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watson.</font>

1679
02:02:50,530 --> 02:02:51,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">John Watson.</font>
