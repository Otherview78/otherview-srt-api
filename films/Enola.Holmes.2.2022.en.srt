1
00:01:06,893 --> 00:01:08,978
New York

2
00:01:12,732 --> 00:01:15,651
Hyun Bin Yoo Hae-jin

3
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:17,549
Lim Yoona

4
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:19,092
Daniel Henney / Jin Seon-gyu

5
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:25,140
Director Lee Seok-hoon

6
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,663
You lost it all by being greedy.

7
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:47,414
Don't kill me...

8
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:48,708
Do you love money that much?

9
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:49,709
Please!

10
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:53,463
Then let's see if this money can save you.

11
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:54,504
Please...

12
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,632
You Mother...

13
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:10,144
FBI! Hands up!

14
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,897
Damn.

15
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,797
It is a nice car.

16
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,342
Always wanted one of these.

17
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,640
Now get out.

18
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:49,144
Dammit, Jack! Are you out of your mind?

19
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:52,022
Mobilizing SWAT without clearing it first?

20
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,112
What the heck were you thinking?

21
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:54,079
I got a tip,

22
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:55,692
I had to act.

23
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,027
- A tip? - Yeah.

24
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,944
From who?

25
00:02:58,028 --> 00:02:59,061
I got an e-mail,

26
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,781
I don't know who it is from.

27
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:02,907
Jesus, Jack, you are killing me.

28
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,825
Hey, it worked out.

29
00:03:05,494 --> 00:03:08,120
Well...

30
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:10,582
Maybe congratulations are in order.

31
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:12,833
You have been after this guy, what, a year now?

32
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:14,501
Why don't you take that vacation

33
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:15,377
you have been putting off?

34
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,671
No, no, there is no time for that,

35
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:17,630
we have to keep digging.

36
00:03:17,713 --> 00:03:19,424
Follow the money, find the sales network,

37
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:20,926
this guy could get a life sentence.

38
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:22,134
- Life? - Yeah.

39
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:23,678
More like a firing squad.

40
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:25,764
Well, it is not North Korea.

41
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:28,599
Not yet.

42
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:38,859
Lim Cheol-ryung, funny seeing you here.

43
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:45,283
You abandoned the party and became a drug peddler?

44
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:49,204
Aren't you ashamed to see your comrades?

45
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,669
I heard your woman died in front of your eyes.

46
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,630
What were you doing then?

47
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,469
That is what I call shameful.

48
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,139
Who is trying to steal my show, huh?

49
00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:08,890
Is it you?

50
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:12,101
I am sorry, he just barged in.

51
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:14,521
As per the agreement with the U.S.,

52
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:16,356
he will be extradited to North Korea.

53
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,898
We appreciate your cooperation.

54
00:04:17,983 --> 00:04:19,025
What the hell is this?

55
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:20,339
With all the waving

56
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:21,820
in my face?

57
00:04:23,238 --> 00:04:24,613
You are interfering

58
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,492
with diplomatic delegation affairs of North Korea.

59
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,498
All right, tough guy.

60
00:04:33,582 --> 00:04:36,333
- Jack! - I am ready now.

61
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:38,473
What the hell are you doing?

62
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:39,962
I told you our orders came straight

63
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:41,381
from the State Department.

64
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,800
You do know that we are in the process of establishing

65
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,011
diplomatic relations with the North Koreans, right?

66
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:47,595
You start the war right now,

67
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:49,890
- we can start right here. - Okay, all right!

68
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:51,599
These men are our responsibility

69
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:53,185
until we get them on a plane,

70
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:55,020
so why don't you continue this little dance

71
00:04:55,103 --> 00:04:56,271
on the way to the airport.

72
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,356
Now!

73
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:01,108
All right.

74
00:06:01,502 --> 00:06:02,878
Thank you, captain.

75
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,132
With the $100 you gave me yesterday,

76
00:06:05,215 --> 00:06:06,758
I bought gifts for my family.

77
00:06:06,842 --> 00:06:07,717
$100?

78
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,720
I thought I gave you $10.

79
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:13,681
I think it got switched, give it back.

80
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:16,810
Oh dear, I spent it all...

81
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,984
Did you prank me again? Come on, captain.

82
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:27,570
I bought a few of these for my wife,

83
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,156
please take one with you.

84
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,210
No need.

85
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:31,741
I got no one to give it to.

86
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:35,911
Captain, enough time has passed.

87
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:41,877
And so many young women desire your attention.

88
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,670
If I was born with that face,

89
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:45,421
I would not live like this.

90
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:08,987
Jack!

91
00:07:10,155 --> 00:07:10,989
No!

92
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:15,326
Back, back, back!

93
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,222
Untie me.

94
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:51,947
Hey!

95
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,436
Cover me!

96
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:24,938
- Comrade! - Damn it!

97
00:08:59,138 --> 00:08:59,973
Let's go!

98
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,256
We should go.

99
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:23,639
Confidential Assignment 2: International

100
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,142
Seoul I am Investigator Kim

101
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:27,727
of the Prosecution Office.

102
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:29,562
Is this Ms. Kim Mi-young?

103
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,021
Your account is being used for illegal transactions...

104
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:32,982
Your private information got leaked.

105
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,401
Please do not be alarmed.

106
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:35,901
Money in your account is in danger...

107
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:37,278
Hello, madame!

108
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:38,989
I am Jung-wook's friend, Sang-hoon.

109
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,281
- He got drunk... - And got into a fight...

110
00:10:40,365 --> 00:10:41,574
So he is at the police station.

111
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:43,701
- Mom? - Hello? Hel...

112
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:44,618
Dammit!

113
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:49,665
Listen here, can't you switch up the script?

114
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,510
No one gets deceived

115
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:53,961
because we are using the same crap!

116
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:56,423
I can't do this anymore.

117
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:57,590
Stupid idiot!

118
00:10:57,673 --> 00:10:58,708
It is your damn acting,

119
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:00,067
stop blaming the script!

120
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,143
As you can see,

121
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:05,598
we are a typical telemarketing firm.

122
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:08,476
I am not sure if it is to your liking.

123
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,729
Telemarketing is all about emotional labor.

124
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:12,822
But collection only deals

125
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,025
with getting the money.

126
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,295
You will get a 1% commission

127
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:17,319
from your collection.

128
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:19,853
1% is way too damn small.

129
00:11:19,936 --> 00:11:21,782
If I get caught by the cops,

130
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:23,450
I am the only one screwed.

131
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,452
It sounds like you got some experience.

132
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:28,038
I worked in the Philippines for a year,

133
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,540
and a 2-year stint in Yanbian...

134
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,626
It would help if you had said so.

135
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,503
Can you write scripts too?

136
00:11:35,586 --> 00:11:37,389
Well, people said

137
00:11:37,473 --> 00:11:40,300
I should be getting a Pulitzer.

138
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:41,946
If you pay me $5,000 per gig,

139
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,429
I can write a killer episode.

140
00:11:44,513 --> 00:11:45,931
What is that for?

141
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,308
Isn't that a camera?

142
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:51,478
You got an eagle eye.

143
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:52,888
I am actually a YouTuber, you know,

144
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:54,438
vlog and stuff.

145
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:55,356
You are a cop!

146
00:11:56,191 --> 00:11:57,484
Everyone, run!

147
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:58,777
Not another step.

148
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:01,798
You thought you could run?

149
00:12:01,881 --> 00:12:04,907
- Man, that hurts. - It is so crowded.

150
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,995
I am Det. Kang Jin-tae of Major Crimes,

151
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,121
scumbags.

152
00:12:09,204 --> 00:12:12,249
Fake accounts, burner phones, forged passports,

153
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:15,085
where did you get them? Answer me!

154
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,378
Who is the supplier?

155
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:20,518
Screw the supplier,

156
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:22,668
I am cold and hungry...

157
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:25,886
this is so messed up, when is he coming?

158
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:28,334
Hey.

159
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:31,684
I hope you guys aren't eating anything without me.

160
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,135
A bowl of hot noodles would be

161
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,743
heaven right now...

162
00:12:35,063 --> 00:12:36,437
We are not some pricks.

163
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,400
How could you say that?

164
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:39,572
He sure can sniff it out,

165
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:41,277
he really is a cop.

166
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,201
Look, he is here.

167
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:57,085
$1,000 per.

168
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:58,043
How many do you need?

169
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:00,380
Look, even the holograms are perfect.

170
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:03,091
I am the only one in Asia who can pull this off.

171
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:07,303
Where are you from?

172
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,014
Russia? Koreyskiy?

173
00:13:09,097 --> 00:13:10,265
Is it that obvious?

174
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:12,260
I came to my grandfather's hometown

175
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:13,693
to make money,

176
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:15,561
and I live near Korea University.

177
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:17,188
So, how many?

178
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:22,110
Excuse me?

179
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,029
Good evening, gents.

180
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:25,697
Are you the car owner?

181
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,407
Great work, you two.

182
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:28,408
Cop, cop.

183
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:31,077
This car comes up as an illegal vehicle.

184
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:34,289
I see, I am a cop, cop.

185
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:35,248
Sergei.

186
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:36,333
Sergei!

187
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,669
He looks similar to the sketch

188
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,630
of the serial kidnapper...

189
00:13:42,713 --> 00:13:43,840
It is not like that!

190
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,301
I am Major Crimes, Major Crimes.

191
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:47,510
It is a major crime for sure!

192
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,136
You guys are so clueless.

193
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,430
- Don't move, please. - Yeah, a major crime.

194
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:52,099
Look, I was right!

195
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:53,809
You used this to kidnap girls!

196
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:54,766
You pervert!

197
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,769
That is why you need fake passports!

198
00:13:56,851 --> 00:13:57,938
- Fake passports? - Fake passports!

199
00:13:58,021 --> 00:14:00,065
- I am a cop! Cop! - Don't move!

200
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:02,691
I am a Major Crimes detective!

201
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:04,527
I am undercover to get this prick!

202
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,444
Damn it!

203
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:13,286
He is running away, go after him!

204
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:21,127
You idiot! Stop right there!

205
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:25,922
Crazy idiot!

206
00:14:26,006 --> 00:14:27,551
Stop the car, idiot!

207
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:51,491
You magnetic scum!

208
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,960
Get rid of the noodles!

209
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,880
Hey! Sesame Ramyun?

210
00:15:04,963 --> 00:15:07,257
We did not eat.

211
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:13,638
Why is he hanging on the hood?

212
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:15,307
If he falls off, stop the car, okay?

213
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,558
Stay on the right!

214
00:15:25,776 --> 00:15:26,942
Jin-tae is going to fall!

215
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:37,953
Stop!

216
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,756
Be careful!

217
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,804
Damn you!

218
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:05,397
Don't cry, it is okay.

219
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:07,107
Where is your mom?

220
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:10,403
Mom...

221
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:11,780
Are you okay?

222
00:16:12,197 --> 00:16:13,281
That could have been bad.

223
00:16:16,052 --> 00:16:18,578
You should have blocked him.

224
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:21,373
Detective.

225
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:22,290
Look, blood.

226
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:26,211
What? Why do I have blood...

227
00:16:26,294 --> 00:16:28,338
How is that...

228
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:35,220
Hey, easy!

229
00:16:37,222 --> 00:16:39,684
2 months later

230
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:40,725
Cyber Crime Investigation

231
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:43,310
So you bought a used phone from someone online...

232
00:16:43,394 --> 00:16:44,520
My head...

233
00:16:45,564 --> 00:16:47,189
And the box contained

234
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:50,026
fried chicken containers and bones?

235
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,213
There was a plastic bag too,

236
00:16:51,296 --> 00:16:52,904
so I opened it,

237
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:55,447
and there were some feces.

238
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:56,365
Feces?

239
00:16:57,325 --> 00:17:01,413
So many lunatics...

240
00:17:01,496 --> 00:17:03,623
How big was the feces, about this big?

241
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:06,959
This big.

242
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,461
Was it human poop?

243
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:10,880
So, on May 6th,

244
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,549
Banghak internet cafe,

245
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:13,967
you two got into a two-way assault, right?

246
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:16,343
Then it is a simple assault.

247
00:17:16,427 --> 00:17:17,457
Why is the Cyber Bureau handling

248
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,846
a simple assault case?

249
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:19,930
Who registered this case?

250
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,640
I did, sir.

251
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:23,685
Is a fight at an internet cafe a cybercrime?

252
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:25,059
He beat someone with a keyboard...

253
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:27,439
Jeez...

254
00:17:27,522 --> 00:17:29,401
If it was a bundle of cash,

255
00:17:29,486 --> 00:17:30,983
then it would be a financial crime?

256
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:31,794
And a calculator

257
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:33,360
would be a digital crime?

258
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:35,451
Sorry, sir.

259
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:37,933
- Genius. - Damn.

260
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:40,452
Pyongyang

261
00:17:40,535 --> 00:17:43,287
Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery

262
00:17:43,747 --> 00:17:46,124
Han Kwang-sung North Korean People's Army

263
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:50,503
The Recon bureau found traces

264
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:52,798
of Jang Myung-jun in Hanoi, Vietnam.

265
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:54,925
But there was a wrinkle.

266
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,094
They used fake passports to fly into South Korea.

267
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,051
Pardon?

268
00:18:00,135 --> 00:18:01,240
During the great famine,

269
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:03,058
our party produced meth

270
00:18:03,141 --> 00:18:05,477
at the 915 research lab to gain foreign currency.

271
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,019
But the party reversed the decision

272
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:08,188
for diplomatic reasons.

273
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:12,149
But having tasted money,

274
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:13,636
Jang disappeared

275
00:18:13,721 --> 00:18:15,040
with a $1 billion Swiss account.

276
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,322
That much money could fill

277
00:18:16,406 --> 00:18:18,405
the bellies of our entire country.

278
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:20,366
Why South Korea?

279
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:23,703
It means the money handler is there.

280
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:34,172
The head of 915, Kim Cheol-su.

281
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:38,317
If Jang and Kim are both caught

282
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,137
by the U.S,

283
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,846
The peace treaty talk is over

284
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:43,889
and the famine will continue.

285
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,339
The meeting venue has changed

286
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:48,269
from Singapore to Seoul.

287
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,606
It has been settled with the South, so go right away.

288
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,140
I will come down myself in a week with the delegation.

289
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:57,021
Find the money man

290
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:58,486
until then,

291
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:00,925
and get Jang and the $1 billion.

292
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:03,594
Release the samples.

293
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:05,596
And bring out the junkies.

294
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:22,322
Capitalism sure is nice!

295
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:26,033
You were alive.

296
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:27,187
I was surprised

297
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:28,703
to hear the rumor of your arrest.

298
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,980
Mr. Cho,

299
00:20:34,063 --> 00:20:35,752
you must have been worried about me.

300
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:37,386
I was wondering if you were the one

301
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,296
who ratted me out.

302
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,258
That is impossible.

303
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:44,261
Right, you don't have the balls to do that.

304
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,637
What is the status of the money?

305
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,013
As I have told you before,

306
00:20:47,097 --> 00:20:48,640
pulling out of the investment

307
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:50,307
could result in heavy losses.

308
00:20:50,391 --> 00:20:51,642
If you give me a bit more time...

309
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:14,540
Your girl sure is pretty.

310
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,009
If my daughter was alive,

311
00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:18,419
she would be about her age.

312
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:30,556
Have you ever eaten pickled human flesh?

313
00:21:33,351 --> 00:21:34,685
It is not good at all.

314
00:21:37,355 --> 00:21:39,524
Don't force me to make you taste it.

315
00:21:40,191 --> 00:21:41,066
You got 3 days.

316
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:53,579
Use the red...

317
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,873
to add a shadow here.

318
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,043
Be thorough with the mascara.

319
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:01,462
Like this, slowly.

320
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:03,924
All done!

321
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:06,760
We tried out Oriental smokey make-up

322
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:09,512
that is all the rage in Berlin club scene.

323
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,013
How do you like it?

324
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,184
Trendsetting Min-young's Make-over Show.

325
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,353
That is it for today.

326
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:19,103
Subscribe and like are love.

327
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:22,359
What was that for?

328
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:25,903
How many times did I call you for breakfast?

329
00:22:25,986 --> 00:22:27,197
Come out!

330
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:30,741
I have to re-shoot it because of you.

331
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:33,954
I have to always beg.

332
00:22:34,037 --> 00:22:35,372
Can't you see that I am working?

333
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:37,331
Powdering your face is working?

334
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,041
This is all you do after sending you

335
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,752
to the make-up school?

336
00:22:40,836 --> 00:22:43,213
Like, like, love!

337
00:22:43,296 --> 00:22:44,965
You are so clueless about it,

338
00:22:45,048 --> 00:22:46,298
but a hot YouTuber

339
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:48,760
could make over $100,000 a month.

340
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:50,846
- Seriously? - Yes.

341
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:53,889
So? How much have you made?

342
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,435
$36.

343
00:22:56,518 --> 00:22:57,393
In a day?

344
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:58,701
No, I only started making some,

345
00:22:58,785 --> 00:22:59,771
I made that in a year.

346
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:01,022
- Screw you! - In a year?

347
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:02,439
Not a month, but a year?

348
00:23:02,523 --> 00:23:04,258
So, $36 in 365 days

349
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,360
equals 10 cents a day.

350
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:09,114
Call your aunt "10-cent girl" from now on.

351
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,412
You have got to put me down too?

352
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:14,219
I went places as a teen.

353
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:15,454
Really?

354
00:23:16,287 --> 00:23:19,374
- I lost my appetite. - Don't eat.

355
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,917
What is with you again?

356
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:23,754
You said you won't eat.

357
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:25,255
You have to take it away?

358
00:23:25,338 --> 00:23:27,591
This food is wasted on you.

359
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:39,727
Why are you playing with toys during work hours?

360
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,354
Don't say that, the world has changed.

361
00:23:42,438 --> 00:23:43,899
This can search for missing people

362
00:23:43,982 --> 00:23:45,567
and crack down on traffic violations.

363
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,734
Even if the world has changed,

364
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:48,957
investigations are done on foot,

365
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,697
and arrests are made by cops.

366
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:52,282
Come on, sir.

367
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:54,090
You are in Cyber Bureau now,

368
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:55,784
you should earn some certifications.

369
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,369
Do you think I will rot here?

370
00:23:57,453 --> 00:24:00,206
I am going back to Major Crimes even if it kills me.

371
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:02,666
Is the rumor true?

372
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,530
What?

373
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:04,291
That you closed a big case

374
00:24:04,374 --> 00:24:06,098
with a North Korean cop.

375
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:08,673
- You heard that? - Yes.

376
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:10,090
- You too? - Yes.

377
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:15,472
No one can keep secrets around here!

378
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:17,641
My goodness!

379
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,606
Supernote plates had the potential

380
00:24:24,689 --> 00:24:27,234
to collapse the world economy.

381
00:24:27,317 --> 00:24:30,445
The North Korean cop was named Lim Cheol-ryung,

382
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:33,240
and he said it had to be me,

383
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:36,535
he followed me around and relied on me.

384
00:24:38,786 --> 00:24:39,777
That is all I will say.

385
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:41,019
I wish we could work

386
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:42,810
on a big case like that.

387
00:24:42,893 --> 00:24:43,640
If you are a cop,

388
00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:44,244
you will get a chance...

389
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,379
Why are they here?

390
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:48,296
Hey!

391
00:24:49,464 --> 00:24:50,298
Hey!

392
00:24:51,048 --> 00:24:53,801
Cheol-ryung? Don't lie to me.

393
00:24:53,884 --> 00:24:55,512
I am serious!

394
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:57,304
- Yeah? - Yeah.

395
00:24:57,388 --> 00:25:01,298
They are coming down for the North Korea-US meeting,

396
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,479
and they have some bullshit pretense.

397
00:25:04,563 --> 00:25:05,508
The Feds didn't believe

398
00:25:05,592 --> 00:25:07,156
that they are coming down

399
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,440
for a drug dealer.

400
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:09,734
So?

401
00:25:09,817 --> 00:25:14,030
They were going to assign a volunteer as Lim's partner.

402
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:15,447
Okay.

403
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:17,992
None, not one volunteered.

404
00:25:18,075 --> 00:25:18,951
Why not?

405
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:20,202
The rumor of your family

406
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,163
almost getting killed got around.

407
00:25:22,456 --> 00:25:23,707
Everyone is trying to stay away.

408
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:27,152
So, no one seems to be registering

409
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:28,879
for Harvard?

410
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:31,673
Right, you will get it automatically.

411
00:25:31,757 --> 00:25:34,134
Then you guys do it, why are you asking me?

412
00:25:34,217 --> 00:25:35,593
I got a wedding date.

413
00:25:35,676 --> 00:25:36,720
All of sudden?

414
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:38,889
And you?

415
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:40,557
My kid is studying for college...

416
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,309
He is the one taking the exam, not you!

417
00:25:42,392 --> 00:25:45,102
Will you stay in the Cyber Bureau forever?

418
00:25:45,186 --> 00:25:46,103
You should return to Major Crimes.

419
00:25:46,187 --> 00:25:47,147
I have to!

420
00:25:49,024 --> 00:25:51,568
What a headache.

421
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:53,987
If my wife finds out, she will kill me.

422
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,947
What? Cheol-ryung?

423
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:57,949
Him again? Why?

424
00:25:58,033 --> 00:26:01,702
Well, it is for a simple mission to catch a perp.

425
00:26:01,787 --> 00:26:05,241
Did you forget that our family almost died?

426
00:26:05,324 --> 00:26:06,291
How could I forget that?

427
00:26:06,374 --> 00:26:07,375
Then what is with you?

428
00:26:08,168 --> 00:26:09,860
No way, not again.

429
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:11,103
You nuts?

430
00:26:11,187 --> 00:26:13,130
I am not the only cop in Korea.

431
00:26:13,214 --> 00:26:14,006
Right, so right.

432
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:14,905
If your brain had wrinkles,

433
00:26:14,988 --> 00:26:16,634
you would never do it again.

434
00:26:16,717 --> 00:26:18,303
Who is he after this time?

435
00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:20,638
- Well... - Is he...

436
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:22,015
coming to get me?

437
00:26:22,723 --> 00:26:23,731
Forgetting me

438
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,100
would have been harder than dying.

439
00:26:26,394 --> 00:26:27,562
Are you serious?

440
00:26:27,646 --> 00:26:28,896
There she goes again.

441
00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:30,732
He said we would meet again.

442
00:26:30,816 --> 00:26:32,024
He said that out of courtesy,

443
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:33,485
as in "See you after unification."

444
00:26:33,568 --> 00:26:35,237
Because he can't hold back that long.

445
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,154
I can't hold back because of you.

446
00:26:37,238 --> 00:26:38,990
Don't you know men don't care about anything

447
00:26:39,074 --> 00:26:39,866
when they are in love?

448
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,327
She sure lives a sheltered life.

449
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,495
She will live a long life.

450
00:26:43,578 --> 00:26:44,744
I have got no time to lose.

451
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,333
Did Cheol-ryung say he will meet you?

452
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,920
Oh man...

453
00:26:53,003 --> 00:26:54,955
If he ever calls you,

454
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,173
just ignore him.

455
00:26:56,257 --> 00:26:57,008
All right.

456
00:26:57,092 --> 00:26:58,468
If you get mixed up in it,

457
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:00,262
it is an express divorce, got it?

458
00:27:00,344 --> 00:27:01,555
All right, all right.

459
00:27:23,493 --> 00:27:27,204
His secret hiding place must be here somewhere.

460
00:27:27,288 --> 00:27:28,832
Where is it?

461
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:40,759
This looks a bit off.

462
00:27:43,388 --> 00:27:45,390
Be here...

463
00:27:46,557 --> 00:27:49,811
See? Really?

464
00:27:49,895 --> 00:27:51,688
No wonder this air purifier

465
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:53,689
never worked all that well.

466
00:27:55,691 --> 00:27:57,903
Hey, what's up?

467
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:03,073
I floated the idea to my wife,

468
00:28:04,074 --> 00:28:06,411
she flips out whenever Cheol-ryung is mentioned.

469
00:28:06,495 --> 00:28:09,247
Saying it is a divorce, it is understandable though.

470
00:28:10,206 --> 00:28:12,709
Just promise me one thing,

471
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:15,212
that I will return to Major Crimes.

472
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:18,173
I should be risking my life to catch criminals,

473
00:28:18,256 --> 00:28:19,965
not deceive my wife...

474
00:28:21,425 --> 00:28:22,677
Holy cow...

475
00:28:22,761 --> 00:28:23,761
- Jin-tae. - Why are you here?

476
00:28:23,844 --> 00:28:24,742
You will lie to my sister

477
00:28:24,825 --> 00:28:25,724
with Cheol-ryung?

478
00:28:25,807 --> 00:28:27,307
That is incredible...

479
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,558
- No way! - Sis!

480
00:28:28,642 --> 00:28:29,476
Of course not!

481
00:28:32,895 --> 00:28:34,058
Want some money?

482
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:35,315
You can have $360.

483
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:36,899
That is like 10-year worth of YouTube earning.

484
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:37,943
Then how much?

485
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:39,444
20 years? 30 years?

486
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:43,531
50 years? How much is that?

487
00:28:43,613 --> 00:28:44,406
$1,800.

488
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:48,703
That is my spending money for an entire year!

489
00:28:48,786 --> 00:28:49,788
Sis!

490
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:52,706
Shush, I got it.

491
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:53,999
- Another condition. - What is it?

492
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:56,336
Let me meet Cheol-ryung before he leaves.

493
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,672
He has his own preferences, I can't force him.

494
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:00,798
- Okay. - Got it?

495
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:01,967
I will do my best.

496
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,384
- You promised. - Okay!

497
00:29:03,468 --> 00:29:05,262
In exchange...

498
00:29:05,345 --> 00:29:06,637
Got it.

499
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:09,765
Inter-Korean Transit Office

500
00:29:14,563 --> 00:29:17,607
Wow, so dreamy!

501
00:29:21,486 --> 00:29:23,320
Are you the only cop down here?

502
00:29:23,404 --> 00:29:24,698
Yeah, I am the only one.

503
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,532
So good to see you.

504
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,785
Eh? No gun?

505
00:29:31,955 --> 00:29:33,415
The first rule of joint detail,

506
00:29:33,498 --> 00:29:35,625
South Korean cop keeps the gun.

507
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,421
It is all automatic now.

508
00:29:39,504 --> 00:29:41,046
There is a second rule.

509
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:44,023
Not using illegal weapons.

510
00:29:44,568 --> 00:29:48,138
Don't use rolls of toilet paper to beat perps up.

511
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:49,097
Very well.

512
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:51,933
I am actually hungry,

513
00:29:52,017 --> 00:29:53,310
could we eat before we start?

514
00:29:53,393 --> 00:29:55,532
Look at you,

515
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:57,022
I thought the case always came first.

516
00:29:57,105 --> 00:29:58,565
Let me use the South tax money

517
00:29:58,648 --> 00:30:00,107
to plump up my skinny body.

518
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:02,193
You don't look skinny at all.

519
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:05,906
- How about an eel? - Very good.

520
00:30:05,989 --> 00:30:07,448
Okay!

521
00:30:14,998 --> 00:30:18,959
Word-of-Mouth Eel

522
00:30:27,928 --> 00:30:30,680
This is so juicy, it is revolutionary.

523
00:30:31,014 --> 00:30:33,433
Why do you use "revolutionary" for everything?

524
00:30:33,517 --> 00:30:35,185
Then what should I say?

525
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:36,603
Down here...

526
00:30:36,686 --> 00:30:39,314
if you want to emphasize something,

527
00:30:39,397 --> 00:30:41,691
you have got to add "freaking".

528
00:30:41,775 --> 00:30:46,738
For example, it is freaking hot, freaking cool.

529
00:30:46,822 --> 00:30:47,655
You try it.

530
00:30:47,738 --> 00:30:48,865
How juicy is it?

531
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:51,742
It is so freaking juicy.

532
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:56,747
You are so freaking good!

533
00:31:02,503 --> 00:31:03,546
What is the mission this time?

534
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,047
Should I wiretap or hack?

535
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:06,883
Or I could pretend to investigate

536
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:08,308
and keep him running in circles.

537
00:31:08,391 --> 00:31:09,301
Whatever you want...

538
00:31:09,385 --> 00:31:11,220
Investigate by the book.

539
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,097
What?

540
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,307
Investigate the joint detail properly.

541
00:31:14,724 --> 00:31:16,852
And dig for intel doing it.

542
00:31:18,061 --> 00:31:20,105
He probably didn't come here for a drug dealer.

543
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:21,982
They are up to something.

544
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,320
Honestly, what is it this time?

545
00:31:28,404 --> 00:31:30,031
You can't be here

546
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:31,616
for one drug dealer.

547
00:31:43,128 --> 00:31:45,087
That was freaking delicious.

548
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:46,590
What did he say?

549
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:49,009
I can't... Raise the volume.

550
00:31:49,092 --> 00:31:49,926
Yes, sir.

551
00:31:57,225 --> 00:31:59,560
My gosh, so embarrassing.

552
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:02,647
Let's start the investigation.

553
00:32:03,523 --> 00:32:04,608
No need to hurry.

554
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:07,360
Take it slow.

555
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,989
Are you two agents?

556
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:12,616
- No... - Yes.

557
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:14,450
- Yes! - No.

558
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:22,326
These punks are distributing

559
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:25,128
a new type of drugs for a secret fund.

560
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:27,422
Okay, what else?

561
00:32:30,258 --> 00:32:31,927
That is all there is to it?

562
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,137
I was told that one must investigate on foot.

563
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:39,044
That is the old days, it is all about science now.

564
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:42,479
Do you guys have the concept of forensic science?

565
00:32:42,562 --> 00:32:45,241
I guess all your intellectuals

566
00:32:45,324 --> 00:32:48,234
are too busy making missiles.

567
00:32:54,114 --> 00:32:55,491
You guys may have the concept.

568
00:32:56,451 --> 00:32:59,329
Then do you have a way?

569
00:33:00,914 --> 00:33:02,748
There is a revolutionary method.

570
00:33:03,874 --> 00:33:06,919
Jong-gu, the guy in the picture I sent,

571
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:08,921
I need to find guys who deal with him.

572
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:11,133
Show us what Korean engineers can do.

573
00:33:11,216 --> 00:33:12,843
Yes, boss. I confirmed the picture.

574
00:33:13,218 --> 00:33:14,052
Here we go!

575
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,139
Looking for a new type of drug.

576
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:23,811
A proof picture of a drug sample.

577
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:25,105
A New Taste Red Flavor

578
00:33:25,188 --> 00:33:26,022
Delivered in 30 min

579
00:33:27,315 --> 00:33:28,150
Red pill.

580
00:33:28,817 --> 00:33:29,775
Bait them.

581
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:31,110
Okay.

582
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:34,392
Sir, I am tossing in the bait.

583
00:33:34,476 --> 00:33:35,407
I would like to buy the red pill.

584
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,242
I want to buy the red drug.

585
00:33:39,703 --> 00:33:41,034
Anyone biting?

586
00:33:41,118 --> 00:33:42,703
They can deliver

587
00:33:42,786 --> 00:33:44,166
within 30 minutes on a motorcycle.

588
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:46,459
- Ask for a proof picture. - Will do.

589
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,086
Could I see a picture? Not that I don't trust you.

590
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:50,046
Sir, we got a biter!

591
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,298
Okay, yes!

592
00:33:53,216 --> 00:33:54,593
Nice!

593
00:33:58,304 --> 00:33:59,931
Forensic science.

594
00:34:00,015 --> 00:34:02,058
We are after a suspicious motorcycle

595
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:03,685
that is circling the area.

596
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:05,311
Understand? Good luck!

597
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,282
Wait, there!

598
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:21,620
Could you zoom in?

599
00:34:28,627 --> 00:34:30,504
Anguk building, western flower bed, a plastic bag

600
00:34:32,005 --> 00:34:32,998
Okay, suspect found,

601
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:34,715
Anguk Building, western garden!

602
00:34:35,258 --> 00:34:36,551
Okay!

603
00:34:40,555 --> 00:34:41,389
Hey, here it is!

604
00:34:46,937 --> 00:34:48,355
Where are you going?

605
00:34:48,438 --> 00:34:49,406
What is the holdout,

606
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:50,856
we have got to go after him!

607
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:52,149
When they run, we fly,

608
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:53,944
and when they fly, we use our wits.

609
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:56,487
Don't worry, there are security cameras everywhere.

610
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:58,782
Checked.

611
00:35:22,305 --> 00:35:23,305
I am worried.

612
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,934
That you might get hurt?

613
00:35:27,017 --> 00:35:27,935
No.

614
00:35:28,018 --> 00:35:29,701
That they might get hurt.

615
00:35:29,785 --> 00:35:30,981
I will go easy on them.

616
00:35:32,065 --> 00:35:33,066
Okay.

617
00:35:42,783 --> 00:35:44,709
Excuse me!

618
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:45,877
I heard this is a joint

619
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,204
that sells the best dope in town.

620
00:35:47,288 --> 00:35:49,082
Who is the head honcho here?

621
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:50,917
You?

622
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:53,478
This isn't a mom-and-pop shop,

623
00:35:53,562 --> 00:35:55,005
everyone just walks in.

624
00:35:55,088 --> 00:35:57,799
Popular joints are always so rude.

625
00:35:57,883 --> 00:36:00,886
Kneel, idiots.

626
00:36:01,762 --> 00:36:02,845
Buddy, on your knees.

627
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:05,104
Get down on your knees, morons!

628
00:36:05,901 --> 00:36:06,950
You are a pig?

629
00:36:07,893 --> 00:36:09,936
You got crap for manners.

630
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,188
How could you call me that

631
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,481
even before getting acquainted?

632
00:36:12,564 --> 00:36:14,418
Go easy,

633
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:15,901
I can't bribe every damn pig in town.

634
00:36:17,234 --> 00:36:19,988
It is just you two?

635
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:21,697
If you do not comply with the arrest,

636
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,396
I have the right to defend myself.

637
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:24,451
What are you saying?

638
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:26,203
I am genuinely curious,

639
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:29,121
do you have full medical coverage?

640
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:34,000
What a load of crap!

641
00:36:34,294 --> 00:36:35,687
Boys!

642
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:39,924
Jeez, so many were in hiding.

643
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:41,509
So, isn't it better to walk away?

644
00:36:41,593 --> 00:36:43,177
You may go.

645
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,054
Leave, leave, go, you idiot.

646
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:47,264
Go away, you dumb idiot.

647
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:50,102
Look at this punk, go home!

648
00:36:50,185 --> 00:36:53,313
Damn, he caught it!

649
00:36:55,773 --> 00:36:56,817
Bash them up!

650
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:36,272
Look at these idiots.

651
00:37:36,356 --> 00:37:39,067
Cheol-ryung, you are free to use weapons for 5 minutes.

652
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:40,442
1 minute is enough.

653
00:37:40,527 --> 00:37:41,403
Yeah?

654
00:38:32,204 --> 00:38:33,787
Don't move, idiot!

655
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:35,832
Yeah, I am a pig, you idiot.

656
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,249
You will cripple him.

657
00:38:37,334 --> 00:38:39,335
Look who is talking.

658
00:38:40,587 --> 00:38:42,087
Where did you get this drug?

659
00:38:42,171 --> 00:38:43,464
Never seen them before,

660
00:38:43,547 --> 00:38:45,299
they just left these samples.

661
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:47,967
He sounded like a Korean-Chinese.

662
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:49,470
He must be desperate for money,

663
00:38:49,552 --> 00:38:50,931
he is unloading them very cheaply.

664
00:38:51,014 --> 00:38:52,682
He is not some Costco sampler,

665
00:38:52,766 --> 00:38:54,494
Sir, try this dope,

666
00:38:54,577 --> 00:38:55,602
and just walked off?

667
00:38:55,685 --> 00:38:56,560
Please!

668
00:38:56,645 --> 00:39:00,189
I was going to unload these and be done with it.

669
00:39:00,273 --> 00:39:01,608
You should learn to lie properly.

670
00:39:04,568 --> 00:39:05,402
What is this?

671
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:08,038
This is enough to lock you away

672
00:39:08,121 --> 00:39:10,909
until you plaster the wall with crap.

673
00:39:10,992 --> 00:39:12,577
No need to save up for retirement.

674
00:39:12,661 --> 00:39:15,325
Sir! What is the point

675
00:39:15,408 --> 00:39:16,622
of squeezing a hustler?

676
00:39:16,705 --> 00:39:18,834
I will cooperate with you to get those guys,

677
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:21,502
so please let us go this time!

678
00:39:21,585 --> 00:39:22,754
How will you cooperate?

679
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:26,672
Those guys will be here shortly to collect the money.

680
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:27,589
When?

681
00:39:33,055 --> 00:39:34,057
Them?

682
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:41,064
Hey, guys.

683
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:45,609
Oh my...

684
00:39:54,618 --> 00:39:58,122
Did you bring the goods as promised?

685
00:40:04,421 --> 00:40:06,089
What happened to your face?

686
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,425
Oh, this?

687
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,845
South Korean police, don't move!

688
00:40:14,763 --> 00:40:15,806
Lim Cheol-ryung?

689
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:18,559
Why are you here? Should not you be dead?

690
00:40:18,642 --> 00:40:19,853
Where is Jang?

691
00:40:57,224 --> 00:40:58,098
Jong-gu!

692
00:40:58,182 --> 00:40:59,555
We got a fallen suspect,

693
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,602
send me an ambulance!

694
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:21,456
What is the verdict?

695
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,791
Probably a concussion,

696
00:41:22,874 --> 00:41:24,188
he will wake up in the morning

697
00:41:24,272 --> 00:41:25,668
due to sedative.

698
00:41:27,211 --> 00:41:28,130
Det. Lim!

699
00:41:29,548 --> 00:41:31,425
You are causing trouble as soon as you get here?

700
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:33,927
Are you a RoboCop or something?

701
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:35,303
The perp was in front of us,

702
00:41:35,387 --> 00:41:36,595
should we have let him go?

703
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,348
Don't talk back at your superior!

704
00:41:38,432 --> 00:41:40,142
I have had it, come with me.

705
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,393
- For what? - Get over here!

706
00:41:42,476 --> 00:41:43,645
What is it?

707
00:41:45,188 --> 00:41:46,787
Cheol-ryung is uncontrollable,

708
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,233
- only I can manage... - I know, I know.

709
00:41:50,484 --> 00:41:52,320
Good work, really.

710
00:41:53,447 --> 00:41:57,032
You caught the guy on Interpol's Red Notice.

711
00:41:57,116 --> 00:41:59,785
And 3kg of drugs were confiscated.

712
00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:01,997
That is enough to fill our team's quota for a year.

713
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,914
Yeah?

714
00:42:03,457 --> 00:42:06,460
I am sensing something fishy,

715
00:42:06,543 --> 00:42:08,754
have you uncovered anything from Lim?

716
00:42:08,837 --> 00:42:10,173
A 17 versus 1 brawl

717
00:42:10,256 --> 00:42:12,740
you see in movies took place in Seoul.

718
00:42:12,823 --> 00:42:15,050
Hey, hey. Min-young.

719
00:42:15,134 --> 00:42:16,108
Isn't that Cheol-ryung? Look at it.

720
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,303
That looks like Cheol-ryung.

721
00:42:17,386 --> 00:42:19,848
Oh gosh, Cheol-ryung, Cheol-ryung!

722
00:42:20,389 --> 00:42:23,268
He started swinging as soon as he got here.

723
00:42:23,351 --> 00:42:24,603
How is that possible?

724
00:42:24,686 --> 00:42:26,213
Same thing as last time.

725
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:27,446
How is he still so hot?

726
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,720
See? That is why I told him

727
00:42:29,804 --> 00:42:31,942
not to get mixed up with Cheol-ryung.

728
00:42:32,026 --> 00:42:33,864
I wonder which Korean cop

729
00:42:33,947 --> 00:42:36,114
is getting his butt kicked instead.

730
00:42:38,157 --> 00:42:39,658
Wait a minute!

731
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,528
Not again!

732
00:42:48,376 --> 00:42:49,836
I took these discreetly,

733
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,101
a burner phone and a passport.

734
00:42:53,465 --> 00:42:54,674
Good, you did well.

735
00:42:54,758 --> 00:42:56,510
I will work on these,

736
00:42:56,593 --> 00:42:59,006
take Cheol-ryung home, feed him

737
00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:00,343
and get him drunk like last time.

738
00:43:00,426 --> 00:43:03,182
Are you nuts? My wife will kill me!

739
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:06,448
Okay, answer, answer, go on.

740
00:43:06,531 --> 00:43:08,028
You see?

741
00:43:10,774 --> 00:43:11,566
Hi, honey.

742
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,157
You got a death wish?

743
00:43:13,242 --> 00:43:14,985
Get home with Lim right away!

744
00:43:15,069 --> 00:43:16,876
I don't know where Cheol-ryung is!

745
00:43:19,824 --> 00:43:21,742
Did you forget that our family nearly died?

746
00:43:21,826 --> 00:43:23,703
So why are you getting involved?

747
00:43:23,787 --> 00:43:26,164
I didn't want to get involved.

748
00:43:26,248 --> 00:43:28,377
I said no over and over again,

749
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,585
but Cheol-ryung said it had to be me.

750
00:43:30,669 --> 00:43:32,086
When did I...

751
00:43:33,379 --> 00:43:34,464
So-yeon.

752
00:43:34,548 --> 00:43:36,842
But Cheol-ryung still saved us last time.

753
00:43:36,925 --> 00:43:39,091
Yeah, mom,

754
00:43:39,174 --> 00:43:40,717
we should be thanking him for saving us.

755
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:42,305
- Long time no see. - It has been a while...

756
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:44,723
But this is all wrong!

757
00:43:45,183 --> 00:43:48,228
He is here to catch a few drug dealers,

758
00:43:48,311 --> 00:43:49,770
he won't shoot anyone up like last time.

759
00:43:49,853 --> 00:43:52,107
So don't worry, right, Cheol-ryung?

760
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:52,983
That is right.

761
00:43:53,066 --> 00:43:54,859
- So-yeon... - Mom.

762
00:43:56,069 --> 00:44:00,614
Cheol-ryung, we have a nice home, right?

763
00:44:01,283 --> 00:44:03,159
Yes, it is very nice.

764
00:44:03,242 --> 00:44:04,910
It looks like ours,

765
00:44:04,994 --> 00:44:06,412
but it is not, the same thing with the car too.

766
00:44:06,495 --> 00:44:08,789
My home isn't mine either.

767
00:44:08,873 --> 00:44:10,459
The party owns everything.

768
00:44:11,793 --> 00:44:13,856
Right, a similar concept,

769
00:44:13,939 --> 00:44:15,756
the bank owns everything.

770
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,007
So, until we pay them back,

771
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,299
my husband has to stay alive.

772
00:44:18,382 --> 00:44:20,218
Am I a machine that makes money?

773
00:44:20,301 --> 00:44:23,137
If you were, you would be making decent money!

774
00:44:27,225 --> 00:44:28,984
Men have to be handsome

775
00:44:29,068 --> 00:44:30,898
like Cheol-ryung before anything.

776
00:44:30,981 --> 00:44:31,980
Goodness...

777
00:44:32,813 --> 00:44:36,318
I look very common, I am not handsome at all.

778
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:38,862
Do you call that a common face?

779
00:44:38,945 --> 00:44:42,491
Buddy, what about me then?

780
00:44:43,366 --> 00:44:46,661
He is talking rubbish! What a load of nonsense.

781
00:44:46,745 --> 00:44:48,121
Kneel properly.

782
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:55,670
That is enough, wash up, and let's eat.

783
00:44:55,753 --> 00:44:56,755
Yeah?

784
00:44:57,546 --> 00:45:00,092
Should we order some Chinese?

785
00:45:07,891 --> 00:45:10,351
Common face in the North

786
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,443
Why did you blame me?

787
00:45:18,527 --> 00:45:20,361
Sorry, bud.

788
00:45:20,444 --> 00:45:21,479
I missed working in the field,

789
00:45:21,562 --> 00:45:23,198
I just had to.

790
00:45:23,281 --> 00:45:26,451
Even so, one must separate business and pleasure.

791
00:45:26,534 --> 00:45:29,900
That is why I threw the supernote plates

792
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,205
into the ocean,

793
00:45:31,289 --> 00:45:33,249
and never got my promotion...

794
00:45:33,332 --> 00:45:35,501
Must you rehash that over and over again?

795
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:39,840
So, please help me get some promotion.

796
00:45:39,923 --> 00:45:42,717
Let's be frank with each other.

797
00:45:42,801 --> 00:45:44,133
Why is Jang so infamous

798
00:45:44,217 --> 00:45:47,264
that he is on Interpol's Red Notice?

799
00:45:54,396 --> 00:45:57,148
He has been in and out of the country to smuggle meth,

800
00:45:57,231 --> 00:45:58,524
and once it became difficult,

801
00:45:58,606 --> 00:45:59,775
he moved to North America,

802
00:45:59,859 --> 00:46:04,114
and started making and selling a new type of meth.

803
00:46:04,197 --> 00:46:05,281
A new type?

804
00:46:05,364 --> 00:46:06,877
It is special because it can be made

805
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,285
with common chemicals.

806
00:46:09,368 --> 00:46:12,372
But why did he enter South Korea?

807
00:46:12,456 --> 00:46:14,166
He could go anywhere.

808
00:46:16,293 --> 00:46:17,751
- That is... - Go on.

809
00:46:18,752 --> 00:46:19,963
That is what I am curious about.

810
00:46:22,716 --> 00:46:25,676
Did you retrieve any evidence from that guy?

811
00:46:25,759 --> 00:46:27,802
A cell phone or personal belongings?

812
00:46:27,887 --> 00:46:29,055
Not a damn thing.

813
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:34,060
I will go get some more beer.

814
00:46:35,105 --> 00:46:36,228
We ran out,

815
00:46:36,312 --> 00:46:38,022
I will go buy some, so chill here.

816
00:46:41,193 --> 00:46:43,236
Gwang-yong was caught by the police.

817
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,237
What about it?

818
00:46:44,321 --> 00:46:45,779
Lim Cheol-ryung was with them.

819
00:46:46,906 --> 00:46:47,991
Lim Cheol-ryung?

820
00:46:55,123 --> 00:46:57,876
The party must be desperate.

821
00:46:58,292 --> 00:46:59,252
Bang!

822
00:47:01,463 --> 00:47:05,154
Jang's henchman caught,

823
00:47:05,237 --> 00:47:08,929
interrogation tomorrow.

824
00:47:09,012 --> 00:47:11,305
Wrap it up before the meeting, you must hurry.

825
00:47:14,058 --> 00:47:15,435
This is plain wrong.

826
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,354
What do you mean?

827
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:23,859
Out of sight, out of mind!

828
00:47:23,943 --> 00:47:24,911
I finally got over you,

829
00:47:24,996 --> 00:47:26,655
how could you come back?

830
00:47:30,408 --> 00:47:31,430
You came back for me, right?

831
00:47:31,514 --> 00:47:32,486
Work was just an excuse.

832
00:47:33,411 --> 00:47:35,705
No, I really came for work.

833
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:36,755
Liar!

834
00:47:39,876 --> 00:47:40,794
What?

835
00:47:45,006 --> 00:47:46,590
Why can't you look me in the eye?

836
00:47:47,759 --> 00:47:49,885
Well, because I am sorry.

837
00:47:50,762 --> 00:47:51,596
For what?

838
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,809
As you know,

839
00:47:53,147 --> 00:47:55,724
it is realistically impossible.

840
00:47:56,935 --> 00:47:59,688
But why do you decide that?

841
00:47:59,771 --> 00:48:01,909
Why give up even before trying?

842
00:48:09,948 --> 00:48:11,407
Then...

843
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:13,617
you could try unifying our countries.

844
00:48:14,661 --> 00:48:16,455
There won't be any problems.

845
00:48:20,584 --> 00:48:22,544
How could I unify...

846
00:48:23,627 --> 00:48:24,753
Dang it!

847
00:48:26,548 --> 00:48:27,965
What a nonsense.

848
00:48:33,137 --> 00:48:35,849
How could I...

849
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:43,939
Jang looked like a big shot in the States.

850
00:48:44,023 --> 00:48:45,691
Why did someone like him come here?

851
00:48:45,774 --> 00:48:47,986
Curious, right?

852
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:49,237
I asked that too.

853
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,739
What did Cheol-ryung say?

854
00:48:50,822 --> 00:48:51,990
He is curious too.

855
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:55,035
It is your job to find out, you idiot!

856
00:48:55,118 --> 00:48:57,037
I am not a calculator that gives you answers,

857
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,872
just give me some time.

858
00:49:05,294 --> 00:49:06,338
One second.

859
00:49:14,678 --> 00:49:15,722
Holy cow!

860
00:49:16,806 --> 00:49:18,475
Did he notice?

861
00:49:22,604 --> 00:49:24,772
Damn it, got something stuck between my teeth.

862
00:49:27,651 --> 00:49:28,943
Got it, got it.

863
00:49:29,027 --> 00:49:31,680
What is with that suit?

864
00:49:31,763 --> 00:49:34,574
Why is he such an idiot?

865
00:49:34,658 --> 00:49:39,912
He is younger than I am and pats me on the shoulder.

866
00:49:40,412 --> 00:49:42,207
I almost punched him in the jaw.

867
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,292
I think he was a golden parachute,

868
00:49:44,376 --> 00:49:46,168
but because of the supernotes,

869
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:47,546
he missed a promotion.

870
00:49:47,629 --> 00:49:48,814
Was that my fault?

871
00:49:48,897 --> 00:49:51,800
It is his own incompetence.

872
00:49:51,882 --> 00:49:54,135
His incompetence is a bottomless well.

873
00:49:54,218 --> 00:49:56,805
All right, I have got to go.

874
00:49:59,641 --> 00:50:00,766
If it was not for the wiretap,

875
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:01,935
I would have messed him up.

876
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,435
Sure.

877
00:50:06,105 --> 00:50:07,941
- We must unify! - Hey, get up!

878
00:50:08,024 --> 00:50:09,359
What is going on?

879
00:50:09,443 --> 00:50:10,318
What is with her?

880
00:50:10,902 --> 00:50:14,197
- Will you get up? - What is going on?

881
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:15,949
Snap out of it, you idiot!

882
00:50:16,032 --> 00:50:16,907
Did she get drunk?

883
00:50:16,991 --> 00:50:19,119
I am being patriotic with my face.

884
00:50:19,202 --> 00:50:22,121
Do I have to unify our countries too?

885
00:50:22,997 --> 00:50:24,176
It is about time,

886
00:50:24,259 --> 00:50:25,416
she was quiet for a while.

887
00:50:25,499 --> 00:50:27,334
What am I supposed to do with her?

888
00:50:27,419 --> 00:50:28,671
You can't, it is a habit.

889
00:50:28,755 --> 00:50:30,589
If it is unified, there is no problem, right?

890
00:50:30,672 --> 00:50:32,090
Yeah, let's go.

891
00:50:32,174 --> 00:50:34,675
- Let her be. - I am so embarrassed.

892
00:50:34,758 --> 00:50:36,177
Call the police.

893
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,221
No need, I am the cop.

894
00:50:38,304 --> 00:50:40,556
10 cents a day.

895
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:42,475
Bad drunk

896
00:50:50,024 --> 00:50:51,650
Pork belly in the morning?

897
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,445
No one said we can't.

898
00:50:55,363 --> 00:50:56,655
With what money?

899
00:50:57,781 --> 00:50:59,284
Did you give her allowance again?

900
00:50:59,367 --> 00:51:00,910
I don't even have a cent to my name.

901
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:05,123
Cheol-ryung, I cooked this, so have plenty.

902
00:51:05,207 --> 00:51:06,957
Koreans get their strength from this food.

903
00:51:07,416 --> 00:51:08,542
- No need. - Here.

904
00:51:09,668 --> 00:51:10,754
Just try it.

905
00:51:10,837 --> 00:51:13,256
You have got to run out of money, so you can panhandle.

906
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:16,342
I am making money, what is wrong with YouTube?

907
00:51:16,425 --> 00:51:17,344
Mom!

908
00:51:18,887 --> 00:51:19,712
Come eat.

909
00:51:19,795 --> 00:51:21,739
Did you see the piggy bank on my desk?

910
00:51:22,056 --> 00:51:24,392
- Look around. - It is not there.

911
00:51:24,976 --> 00:51:26,514
I saved that to buy

912
00:51:26,598 --> 00:51:28,772
the new BangTan Boys album.

913
00:51:28,854 --> 00:51:30,023
BangTan Boys?

914
00:51:31,149 --> 00:51:33,276
South Korea has that too?

915
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,653
I was in Korean Boys' Union.

916
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:41,325
He found a sense of humor.

917
00:51:41,826 --> 00:51:42,660
Where did it go?

918
00:51:42,952 --> 00:51:44,538
Look for it properly.

919
00:51:44,621 --> 00:51:46,205
You little thief.

920
00:51:46,748 --> 00:51:48,624
It was you, wasn't it?

921
00:51:48,707 --> 00:51:49,543
Hey, stop that.

922
00:51:49,626 --> 00:51:52,421
Can't we have a quiet morning?

923
00:51:52,504 --> 00:51:54,811
I am so sick of this,

924
00:51:54,895 --> 00:51:56,299
I should run away from home.

925
00:51:58,135 --> 00:51:59,009
So early in the morning?

926
00:51:59,093 --> 00:52:00,636
Yes?

927
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:02,472
Okay, I got it.

928
00:52:02,556 --> 00:52:03,973
The suspect woke up.

929
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:05,475
Let's move.

930
00:52:07,894 --> 00:52:10,353
No time to eat, there is no time...

931
00:52:14,233 --> 00:52:15,735
I told you it was not me.

932
00:52:15,819 --> 00:52:18,655
- You are the thief? - Let's move!

933
00:52:21,991 --> 00:52:24,118
Good morning, let us through.

934
00:52:24,578 --> 00:52:26,412
Interrogation is in process, please head back.

935
00:52:26,494 --> 00:52:27,330
What do you mean?

936
00:52:27,414 --> 00:52:28,669
This is now a Foreign Affairs case,

937
00:52:28,753 --> 00:52:30,040
you are off the case.

938
00:52:30,124 --> 00:52:32,750
What do you...

939
00:52:34,087 --> 00:52:35,588
Hey, who are you?

940
00:52:38,091 --> 00:52:39,092
Why are you...

941
00:52:39,926 --> 00:52:41,052
Do you know him?

942
00:52:42,135 --> 00:52:44,306
Thank you for your cooperation.

943
00:52:45,474 --> 00:52:47,726
This fool is now mine.

944
00:52:48,727 --> 00:52:49,978
You scum.

945
00:52:50,979 --> 00:52:52,897
You know how to speak Korean, you lied to me?

946
00:52:53,314 --> 00:52:56,318
Did you ask? You certainly didn't.

947
00:52:57,651 --> 00:52:58,904
My mom is Korean.

948
00:52:58,987 --> 00:52:59,891
Get that paper out of my face.

949
00:53:00,322 --> 00:53:02,198
I caught him, I will interrogate him.

950
00:53:02,531 --> 00:53:03,992
Is it kind of like deja vu?

951
00:53:04,075 --> 00:53:07,828
I have seen this situation before.

952
00:53:07,912 --> 00:53:09,873
Whose fault was it that we lost Jang,

953
00:53:09,956 --> 00:53:11,707
why are you causing a scene here?

954
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:12,876
Is that my fault?

955
00:53:14,127 --> 00:53:16,588
How did they know the route in New York?

956
00:53:18,422 --> 00:53:19,758
Insisting that I leaked it?

957
00:53:20,258 --> 00:53:22,552
How could I trust a nuke-making commie?

958
00:53:22,636 --> 00:53:23,845
You are the one hoarding nukes,

959
00:53:23,929 --> 00:53:25,095
and we can't make any?

960
00:53:25,179 --> 00:53:27,056
He is my suspect now.

961
00:53:28,016 --> 00:53:32,358
You won't find anything,

962
00:53:32,441 --> 00:53:33,604
I will bet everything I own.

963
00:53:33,687 --> 00:53:35,524
Didn't you say everything you own

964
00:53:35,607 --> 00:53:36,732
belongs to the party?

965
00:53:36,816 --> 00:53:38,144
- Brother! - Hey!

966
00:53:38,227 --> 00:53:40,946
I don't know what is going on between you two,

967
00:53:41,029 --> 00:53:43,906
but let's talk this out.

968
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:45,659
Hey! Hello, hello, excuse me.

969
00:53:45,742 --> 00:53:49,245
Nice to meet you, I am a Korean... detective.

970
00:53:49,328 --> 00:53:50,162
Yup.

971
00:53:50,539 --> 00:53:51,498
Nice to meet you.

972
00:53:53,082 --> 00:53:54,042
What are you, a hobbit?

973
00:53:54,126 --> 00:53:55,794
- What? - Are you Antman?

974
00:53:57,879 --> 00:53:59,338
Did you ask me if I am Antman?

975
00:53:59,923 --> 00:54:01,757
You are starting off on the wrong foot.

976
00:54:01,841 --> 00:54:03,175
Have you seen me before?

977
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:08,597
When did you see, how...

978
00:54:09,141 --> 00:54:10,892
This is so frustrating.

979
00:54:11,642 --> 00:54:12,511
Jin-tae!

980
00:54:12,595 --> 00:54:14,438
Keep your underlings on a tighter leash!

981
00:54:14,521 --> 00:54:15,981
I'm sorry.

982
00:54:16,064 --> 00:54:17,362
Det. Kang, let's go out,

983
00:54:17,446 --> 00:54:18,692
Cheol-ryung, follow me.

984
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:21,361
Let's go, Cheol-ryung, come out!

985
00:54:21,443 --> 00:54:22,486
Get over here.

986
00:54:29,076 --> 00:54:31,037
South Koreans picked him up yesterday.

987
00:54:32,414 --> 00:54:34,247
That means Jang is there too.

988
00:54:35,584 --> 00:54:36,500
What is this?

989
00:54:37,043 --> 00:54:40,380
And the North Korean detective is back in the South.

990
00:54:40,464 --> 00:54:42,591
These guys know each other?

991
00:54:42,674 --> 00:54:43,800
Looks like.

992
00:54:43,884 --> 00:54:45,844
We think they are in on it together,

993
00:54:45,926 --> 00:54:47,471
that he is the one who gave them the transport route.

994
00:54:47,554 --> 00:54:48,804
Son of a bitch.

995
00:54:48,888 --> 00:54:50,003
Listen, Jack.

996
00:54:50,087 --> 00:54:52,642
This son of a bitch killed one of our own.

997
00:54:52,725 --> 00:54:55,269
He has to stand trial here in the U.S.

998
00:54:55,644 --> 00:54:57,396
Get yourself on a plane to Seoul.

999
00:54:58,147 --> 00:54:59,775
You got it.

1000
00:54:59,858 --> 00:55:02,903
How could I stop the FBI from barging in?

1001
00:55:02,986 --> 00:55:04,528
FBI got involved?

1002
00:55:06,114 --> 00:55:09,159
This means that there is something even bigger

1003
00:55:09,242 --> 00:55:10,535
than the supernote,

1004
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:12,536
we have to find out first.

1005
00:55:12,621 --> 00:55:15,706
We have got to have a lead to do that.

1006
00:55:15,789 --> 00:55:16,889
Did you pull anything

1007
00:55:16,972 --> 00:55:18,001
from the burner I gave you?

1008
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:20,212
The burner is being recovered,

1009
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:22,338
but I looked into the passport,

1010
00:55:22,421 --> 00:55:25,157
there are only a few people

1011
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,134
who could clone even the holograms.

1012
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:29,888
Look, even the holograms are perfect.

1013
00:55:29,971 --> 00:55:32,432
I am the only one in Asia who can pull this off.

1014
00:55:32,516 --> 00:55:34,099
- Sergei! - Yeah, Sergei.

1015
00:55:34,182 --> 00:55:36,649
It means he sold the passport

1016
00:55:36,732 --> 00:55:39,647
and the burner to Jang.

1017
00:55:39,731 --> 00:55:40,774
- Yeah. - So right.

1018
00:55:40,857 --> 00:55:43,443
The U.S. got involved.

1019
00:55:43,527 --> 00:55:44,444
Whereabouts of the money?

1020
00:55:44,528 --> 00:55:47,385
No evidence yet,

1021
00:55:47,467 --> 00:55:50,408
will bait the South and get help.

1022
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,207
The thing about us Koreans is,

1023
00:55:59,959 --> 00:56:01,962
when the invaders barged in,

1024
00:56:02,044 --> 00:56:04,297
we became one to ward them off.

1025
00:56:04,381 --> 00:56:05,815
We can't let FBI bozos beat us

1026
00:56:05,898 --> 00:56:07,300
to the punch.

1027
00:56:08,051 --> 00:56:10,928
Are you hiding anything from me?

1028
00:56:13,597 --> 00:56:14,766
Jang may have brought in an expert

1029
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:16,642
to produce the drug.

1030
00:56:16,725 --> 00:56:18,019
An expert?

1031
00:56:20,354 --> 00:56:21,940
Why are you telling me this now?

1032
00:56:22,023 --> 00:56:23,858
It is just speculation.

1033
00:56:25,193 --> 00:56:28,822
There is no way they smuggled in such a large shipment.

1034
00:56:29,988 --> 00:56:30,823
Right.

1035
00:56:31,365 --> 00:56:33,452
If they set up a drug factory,

1036
00:56:33,964 --> 00:56:35,244
what about the chemicals?

1037
00:56:37,371 --> 00:56:39,409
There was a chemical theft a week ago.

1038
00:56:39,492 --> 00:56:40,458
Let me see.

1039
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,543
What is Benzyl cyanide?

1040
00:56:42,626 --> 00:56:44,838
It is normally a cosmetic ingredient,

1041
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:46,256
but it can also be used to make meth.

1042
00:56:46,339 --> 00:56:49,008
A guard died from broken neck.

1043
00:56:50,051 --> 00:56:50,886
That is them.

1044
00:56:51,219 --> 00:56:52,763
A stolen truck from there

1045
00:56:52,846 --> 00:56:54,805
was last seen on Yongin highway.

1046
00:56:54,889 --> 00:56:55,724
- Yongin? - Yes.

1047
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,482
Making that much meth will let off

1048
00:56:57,565 --> 00:56:59,935
a ton of poisonous gas and stench.

1049
00:57:00,019 --> 00:57:00,936
Jong-gu.

1050
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,151
Get me a list of derelict factories

1051
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:05,440
and warehouses outside residential areas.

1052
00:57:05,524 --> 00:57:06,482
Let's head out to Yongin.

1053
00:57:07,444 --> 00:57:10,325
Hey, hey, just you two?

1054
00:57:11,823 --> 00:57:12,741
- Oh-deuk! - Yes, sir?

1055
00:57:12,824 --> 00:57:14,700
Bring that and come with us.

1056
00:57:14,783 --> 00:57:15,659
Yes, sir!

1057
00:57:19,623 --> 00:57:20,999
They are going to execute you.

1058
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:22,167
Cooperate.

1059
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:23,918
You won't see your family anymore.

1060
00:57:24,002 --> 00:57:30,258
Don't get any families to see.

1061
00:57:44,147 --> 00:57:44,981
Yep.

1062
00:57:45,607 --> 00:57:47,192
I have shaken off the North Korean detective.

1063
00:57:47,275 --> 00:57:49,027
Any info from the suspect?

1064
00:57:49,111 --> 00:57:50,070
He is not talking yet,

1065
00:57:50,153 --> 00:57:51,832
but I threw some bait,

1066
00:57:51,915 --> 00:57:52,968
so we will see what happens.

1067
00:58:00,703 --> 00:58:01,986
Sir, I have narrowed down the list

1068
00:58:02,069 --> 00:58:03,541
to about 300 suspected sites.

1069
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:05,009
That is still too many.

1070
00:58:05,544 --> 00:58:08,002
Is anything over 500m from the residential area?

1071
00:58:08,087 --> 00:58:09,172
Yeah, do that.

1072
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:43,038
Come on, come on, come on.

1073
00:58:43,122 --> 00:58:44,078
Come on, come on.

1074
00:58:45,542 --> 00:58:46,500
Attaboy!

1075
00:58:58,430 --> 00:58:59,264
He walked past this sector.

1076
00:59:11,234 --> 00:59:13,570
All right, game on, let's go!

1077
00:59:47,354 --> 00:59:48,772
Eagle, you have the baton.

1078
00:59:59,783 --> 01:00:01,868
This is Eagle, I can see the target.

1079
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,427
What? FBI deployed?

1080
01:00:19,386 --> 01:00:21,763
Okay, got it.

1081
01:00:22,721 --> 01:00:24,224
That idiot must have a lead,

1082
01:00:24,307 --> 01:00:25,684
too bad for your savings.

1083
01:00:25,767 --> 01:00:26,601
Brother.

1084
01:00:26,685 --> 01:00:27,602
Do you see anything?

1085
01:00:27,686 --> 01:00:28,894
The drone battery is almost dead,

1086
01:00:28,978 --> 01:00:29,980
and it is clocking out time.

1087
01:00:30,063 --> 01:00:30,981
Should we pull out?

1088
01:00:31,064 --> 01:00:33,817
Oh-deuk, man, just keep flying!

1089
01:00:34,483 --> 01:00:35,735
Don't make excuses.

1090
01:00:35,819 --> 01:00:36,653
Wait a minute.

1091
01:00:37,279 --> 01:00:38,655
Isn't that the stolen truck?

1092
01:00:38,988 --> 01:00:41,115
Get closer over there, a bit more.

1093
01:00:41,658 --> 01:00:45,954
Let's check it out before the sun sets.

1094
01:00:55,254 --> 01:00:56,255
You are sure, right?

1095
01:00:57,924 --> 01:00:59,586
I will void our first rule for a moment,

1096
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:01,553
take this.

1097
01:01:02,636 --> 01:01:04,180
- Oh-deuk. - Yes, sir?

1098
01:01:04,263 --> 01:01:05,528
Stay here

1099
01:01:05,611 --> 01:01:07,481
and if we don't come back in 10 minutes...

1100
01:01:07,564 --> 01:01:08,616
Should I go home?

1101
01:01:09,603 --> 01:01:12,063
- Call for backup, moron! - Sure!

1102
01:01:13,522 --> 01:01:14,398
Let's move.

1103
01:01:35,294 --> 01:01:37,671
Why is an ambulance here?

1104
01:01:42,886 --> 01:01:43,887
Captain!

1105
01:02:22,676 --> 01:02:25,219
These guys are dangerous, keep your eyes open.

1106
01:02:25,512 --> 01:02:26,513
Be ready to fire.

1107
01:02:27,305 --> 01:02:28,139
Let's go.

1108
01:02:28,222 --> 01:02:32,936
Restricted Number

1109
01:02:35,522 --> 01:02:37,899
Did you like the hospital food?

1110
01:02:38,232 --> 01:02:41,527
Captain, I got out of there, where are you?

1111
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:44,156
Comrade Gwang-yong, you have a long tail.

1112
01:02:47,033 --> 01:02:49,994
You know we don't allow the hostage.

1113
01:02:50,954 --> 01:02:52,164
Clean up the mess.

1114
01:02:53,165 --> 01:02:56,042
Thank you for your dedication.

1115
01:02:59,713 --> 01:03:01,715
Freeze! Show me your hands!

1116
01:03:01,798 --> 01:03:03,174
Hey! Hey, hey!

1117
01:03:03,257 --> 01:03:04,821
There is a bomb! Boom!

1118
01:03:04,904 --> 01:03:06,260
What are you doing here?

1119
01:03:07,471 --> 01:03:09,763
It was an honor to serve you.

1120
01:03:11,224 --> 01:03:12,892
I will carry out your order.

1121
01:03:18,647 --> 01:03:20,609
Back! Back!

1122
01:04:16,665 --> 01:04:17,499
Are you okay?

1123
01:04:25,589 --> 01:04:27,676
You are it, you are the spy.

1124
01:04:31,054 --> 01:04:31,972
How did they know?

1125
01:04:32,055 --> 01:04:33,305
It is all my fault?

1126
01:04:33,389 --> 01:04:34,082
Your incompetence screwed us

1127
01:04:34,166 --> 01:04:35,407
every time.

1128
01:04:35,724 --> 01:04:38,437
What are you doing? Get off of him!

1129
01:04:39,187 --> 01:04:40,650
What's with you two?

1130
01:04:41,648 --> 01:04:43,358
It is a damn show here,

1131
01:04:43,442 --> 01:04:46,069
what are you doing in my country?

1132
01:04:46,153 --> 01:04:47,571
Do you not see that?

1133
01:04:51,991 --> 01:04:53,117
Come with me.

1134
01:04:55,454 --> 01:04:56,455
Come on!

1135
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:01,460
Briquette BBQ

1136
01:05:02,949 --> 01:05:04,408
Let's disinfect.

1137
01:05:11,219 --> 01:05:12,763
Cheol-ryung, listen carefully.

1138
01:05:12,846 --> 01:05:15,098
Jack, listen carefully too.

1139
01:05:15,182 --> 01:05:16,725
It is a state of emergency.

1140
01:05:16,808 --> 01:05:18,894
Greatest American, North

1141
01:05:18,977 --> 01:05:22,439
and South Korean detectives are here.

1142
01:05:23,356 --> 01:05:27,027
Others might laugh at me for saying this,

1143
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:29,279
but we are the Avengers.

1144
01:05:29,362 --> 01:05:32,407
Thanos is about to snap his finger,

1145
01:05:32,491 --> 01:05:34,560
should Iron Man and Captain America

1146
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:37,077
have a pissing contest?

1147
01:05:37,161 --> 01:05:39,705
Cool your pride!

1148
01:05:39,788 --> 01:05:42,834
Let's have an international joint detail!

1149
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,711
If you are keeping secrets, let them all out.

1150
01:05:45,795 --> 01:05:46,922
All will be forgiven!

1151
01:05:47,005 --> 01:05:48,757
This clown knows shit.

1152
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:50,174
You're a fucking liar.

1153
01:05:51,675 --> 01:05:54,867
Jack, your entire team is hospitalized,

1154
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,472
who will you work with?

1155
01:05:56,555 --> 01:05:57,598
And you, Cheol-ryung,

1156
01:05:57,681 --> 01:05:59,810
all your leads are gone!

1157
01:05:59,893 --> 01:06:02,270
Who exactly is Jang?

1158
01:06:11,154 --> 01:06:12,239
What is that?

1159
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:17,952
Do you two know each other?

1160
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:19,996
I told you he was a liar.

1161
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:24,347
He was a superior I respected,

1162
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:25,794
but not anymore.

1163
01:06:25,877 --> 01:06:27,842
He was a guerrilla dispatched to Africa,

1164
01:06:27,925 --> 01:06:30,298
and his men are all mercs.

1165
01:06:32,426 --> 01:06:37,055
You only talk when I beg to spill everything, right?

1166
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:39,891
You said all will be forgiven.

1167
01:06:42,226 --> 01:06:44,020
All right, all right.

1168
01:06:44,938 --> 01:06:47,023
So why did he bring in the mercs?

1169
01:06:48,647 --> 01:06:49,481
Money.

1170
01:06:49,984 --> 01:06:50,819
Money?

1171
01:06:51,528 --> 01:06:52,508
2 months ago,

1172
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:53,572
I received an e-mail

1173
01:06:53,655 --> 01:06:55,531
from an alias 'Adolf Bormann'.

1174
01:06:55,614 --> 01:06:57,451
That is how I was able to get Jang.

1175
01:06:58,326 --> 01:07:00,871
I believe that Bormann is

1176
01:07:00,954 --> 01:07:02,873
a Korean-American named Michael Cho.

1177
01:07:02,956 --> 01:07:06,334
Michael Cho is laundering it, he is uh...

1178
01:07:06,418 --> 01:07:08,003
- Money laundering? - Laundering.

1179
01:07:08,086 --> 01:07:11,882
If Cho backstabbed Jang,

1180
01:07:11,965 --> 01:07:15,302
it means he took the money.

1181
01:07:15,594 --> 01:07:19,848
So Jang brought in mercs to get the money back?

1182
01:07:19,931 --> 01:07:21,099
Bingo.

1183
01:07:21,183 --> 01:07:22,976
Why did he choose South Korea?

1184
01:07:23,059 --> 01:07:26,980
Why else? It means the money handler is there.

1185
01:07:27,063 --> 01:07:28,772
How much are we talking about?

1186
01:07:29,497 --> 01:07:30,692
The amount is not the issue.

1187
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:32,128
He must be stopped before

1188
01:07:32,211 --> 01:07:33,727
he causes an even bigger mess,

1189
01:07:33,811 --> 01:07:35,404
but no leads.

1190
01:07:39,909 --> 01:07:42,204
I actually have something to spill too.

1191
01:07:43,455 --> 01:07:46,707
I confiscated the suspect's burner phone.

1192
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:48,167
- That is... - Listen first.

1193
01:07:49,086 --> 01:07:50,176
I know who gave him the burner,

1194
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:51,546
his name is Sergei.

1195
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:53,779
If we catch Sergei,

1196
01:07:53,862 --> 01:07:55,675
we can get Jang's number,

1197
01:07:55,759 --> 01:07:57,968
and triangulate his current position.

1198
01:07:58,052 --> 01:07:59,012
Got it?

1199
01:07:59,553 --> 01:08:02,932
Okay, okay, let's drink.

1200
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,604
Drink this and we are on a 3-way joint detail.

1201
01:08:08,687 --> 01:08:10,189
- Very well. - Okay.

1202
01:08:13,652 --> 01:08:15,612
I love this!

1203
01:08:19,698 --> 01:08:22,952
Let me tell you something from my childhood.

1204
01:08:24,453 --> 01:08:26,872
There was a show called 'Chief Inspector'.

1205
01:08:26,956 --> 01:08:31,962
The protagonist was an actor named Choi Bul-am.

1206
01:08:32,045 --> 01:08:37,115
With a trench coat and a cigarette in his mouth,

1207
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:40,469
he looked so cool!

1208
01:08:42,013 --> 01:08:46,309
Back then, he looked so old,

1209
01:08:47,394 --> 01:08:49,864
but now I am his age,

1210
01:08:49,947 --> 01:08:50,981
it is too cruel!

1211
01:08:51,064 --> 01:08:53,316
Jin-tae, stop being a cheap drunk.

1212
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,203
How could you be so curt?

1213
01:08:56,286 --> 01:08:57,320
Use honorific words.

1214
01:08:57,404 --> 01:08:59,905
Say 'hyung' to him.

1215
01:08:59,989 --> 01:09:01,616
I don't know what honorific words mean.

1216
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,201
No such thing in English.

1217
01:09:03,285 --> 01:09:04,119
We are all friends.

1218
01:09:07,289 --> 01:09:10,917
Wait, what is your birth year?

1219
01:09:12,169 --> 01:09:14,879
I was born in 1982.

1220
01:09:19,092 --> 01:09:20,302
Let's do it the American way.

1221
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:22,858
Hey! Hey!

1222
01:09:22,942 --> 01:09:24,723
I am older right?

1223
01:09:25,599 --> 01:09:27,308
I think the other one looks better.

1224
01:09:27,391 --> 01:09:28,517
Yeah?

1225
01:09:30,061 --> 01:09:31,521
Do you like him that much?

1226
01:09:31,605 --> 01:09:33,000
Yeah, I always see him

1227
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:35,066
in slow motion.

1228
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,736
Was it like that when you first saw Jin-tae?

1229
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:39,278
Don't know, I don't remember.

1230
01:09:39,738 --> 01:09:41,239
Dad is almost home.

1231
01:09:41,323 --> 01:09:43,324
What? No!

1232
01:09:43,407 --> 01:09:44,200
- Yeah? - No, no, no!

1233
01:09:44,283 --> 01:09:45,326
- No, no, no! - That was fast.

1234
01:09:45,409 --> 01:09:46,702
Could you clean up here?

1235
01:09:46,785 --> 01:09:47,786
Oh man...

1236
01:09:49,706 --> 01:09:50,707
Bring them!

1237
01:09:59,966 --> 01:10:01,843
What are you doing?

1238
01:10:06,223 --> 01:10:07,848
You are holding it upside down.

1239
01:10:07,932 --> 01:10:09,976
Okay, go away.

1240
01:10:25,784 --> 01:10:28,203
Cheol-ryung, are you hurt?

1241
01:10:28,286 --> 01:10:29,287
It is okay.

1242
01:10:29,788 --> 01:10:31,330
Come, sit over here.

1243
01:10:35,168 --> 01:10:36,253
Let me see you.

1244
01:10:57,441 --> 01:10:58,525
How are you?

1245
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,734
Fine, thank you, and you?

1246
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:02,278
Better now.

1247
01:11:02,361 --> 01:11:04,114
What happened to your face?

1248
01:11:04,197 --> 01:11:06,575
We had a group of volunteer work.

1249
01:11:06,658 --> 01:11:09,008
This is Jack,

1250
01:11:09,092 --> 01:11:10,954
he is an FBI agent.

1251
01:11:11,955 --> 01:11:13,874
My wife and daughter, sister.

1252
01:11:13,957 --> 01:11:15,125
Nice meeting you.

1253
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:16,376
Good evening.

1254
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,711
So good to meet you.

1255
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:21,798
You speak Korean so well.

1256
01:11:23,425 --> 01:11:27,137
I heard Korea was full of beauty,

1257
01:11:27,219 --> 01:11:28,137
it really is true.

1258
01:11:29,638 --> 01:11:31,348
Look at you, I thought you didn't know

1259
01:11:31,433 --> 01:11:32,516
how to use honorifics.

1260
01:11:32,851 --> 01:11:34,770
I think you should wash up.

1261
01:11:34,853 --> 01:11:35,896
You should.

1262
01:11:35,979 --> 01:11:37,272
- Oh yeah, little. - Give him dad's big clothes.

1263
01:11:37,355 --> 01:11:38,939
- Son of a gun. - Shower, shower.

1264
01:11:39,023 --> 01:11:42,611
- Washroom. - It is over there.

1265
01:11:42,694 --> 01:11:45,113
Show him where it is, honey?

1266
01:11:45,197 --> 01:11:46,779
Don't have any, I threw them away.

1267
01:11:48,325 --> 01:11:49,910
No! Where is it?

1268
01:11:49,993 --> 01:11:54,080
The one with the striped T-shirt!

1269
01:11:54,956 --> 01:11:59,169
It is okay, she was too much anyway.

1270
01:11:59,252 --> 01:12:01,046
She is not the only woman on earth.

1271
01:12:01,129 --> 01:12:02,005
It is okay.

1272
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:04,841
Come on...

1273
01:12:08,427 --> 01:12:09,261
Okay.

1274
01:12:16,811 --> 01:12:18,396
I gave up some intel just to give them

1275
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,940
the impression that I am cooperating.

1276
01:12:20,023 --> 01:12:21,357
Good, watch yourself around

1277
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,302
that South Korean detective though.

1278
01:12:23,386 --> 01:12:24,735
They play like they are enemies,

1279
01:12:24,819 --> 01:12:26,320
but they are on the same side.

1280
01:12:34,954 --> 01:12:37,290
The Americans know about the money.

1281
01:12:37,374 --> 01:12:39,548
It is all over if they come sniffing around,

1282
01:12:39,631 --> 01:12:40,669
hurry up.

1283
01:12:40,752 --> 01:12:42,421
We must secure the money first.

1284
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,966
And don't trust the South Korean detective.

1285
01:12:46,049 --> 01:12:47,470
They talk about a single Korean race,

1286
01:12:47,554 --> 01:12:49,469
but they are in bed with Americans.

1287
01:12:49,552 --> 01:12:50,679
Understood, sir.

1288
01:12:51,012 --> 01:12:53,140
I think they both clued in.

1289
01:12:55,267 --> 01:12:56,101
What about Det. Kang?

1290
01:12:57,601 --> 01:12:59,771
Well, you know what he is like.

1291
01:13:00,604 --> 01:13:02,273
It is me we are talking about,

1292
01:13:02,356 --> 01:13:03,817
I used booze to knock out them.

1293
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,069
I am so damn sober,

1294
01:13:06,153 --> 01:13:09,405
while Cheol-ryung and Jack are drunk as a bat.

1295
01:13:10,157 --> 01:13:12,159
These guys are more careless than they look.

1296
01:13:12,659 --> 01:13:14,910
By the way, do I get reimbursed

1297
01:13:14,994 --> 01:13:16,704
for the extra expenses?

1298
01:13:16,788 --> 01:13:18,707
I better get every single cent back.

1299
01:13:18,789 --> 01:13:20,465
The expenditure isn't the problem,

1300
01:13:20,548 --> 01:13:21,334
just stay alert.

1301
01:13:21,418 --> 01:13:22,836
You're the South Korean rep.

1302
01:13:22,918 --> 01:13:25,795
Oh yeah, there is a guy named Michael Cho,

1303
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,382
could you look him up?

1304
01:13:27,466 --> 01:13:28,174
Michael Cho?

1305
01:13:28,257 --> 01:13:31,427
He may have stolen Jang's money.

1306
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:35,515
So, Jang must have smuggled in to get his money back,

1307
01:13:35,599 --> 01:13:36,891
with his henchmen.

1308
01:13:37,434 --> 01:13:38,894
Got it, got it, Michael Cho.

1309
01:13:38,977 --> 01:13:40,311
Oh my, oh my!

1310
01:13:40,393 --> 01:13:42,481
Please change into this.

1311
01:13:42,564 --> 01:13:43,648
- Okay. - Change.

1312
01:13:43,732 --> 01:13:45,108
What is it?

1313
01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:46,610
All right, that is it for now, I have to go.

1314
01:13:46,693 --> 01:13:47,694
Hey, Jin-tae...

1315
01:13:48,236 --> 01:13:49,780
Idiot, he hung up on me.

1316
01:13:49,863 --> 01:13:51,364
- Is that a scar? - Scar? Where?

1317
01:13:51,448 --> 01:13:53,116
That must have been painful, it is so big.

1318
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,035
- Oh this? - Let me see.

1319
01:13:55,118 --> 01:13:56,860
I got hurt

1320
01:13:56,943 --> 01:13:58,163
while fighting off the Russian mafia.

1321
01:13:58,246 --> 01:14:00,706
- Russian mafia? - That sounds so surreal.

1322
01:14:00,789 --> 01:14:03,709
On the back too, it is so big!

1323
01:14:03,793 --> 01:14:05,336
Came up to me when I was in Moscow,

1324
01:14:05,418 --> 01:14:06,963
he came up behind me, and just...

1325
01:14:09,508 --> 01:14:12,761
You are so incredible.

1326
01:14:12,844 --> 01:14:15,972
Stop showing off wounds from the playground.

1327
01:14:17,891 --> 01:14:20,825
Back home, even disinfectant is rare

1328
01:14:20,909 --> 01:14:22,477
so we just use bean paste on it.

1329
01:14:22,771 --> 01:14:25,105
That is nothing at all? You are so hot, Cheol-ryung.

1330
01:14:25,189 --> 01:14:26,482
You can't call that a scar.

1331
01:14:26,565 --> 01:14:30,861
I was about to cuff a cow thief,

1332
01:14:30,945 --> 01:14:33,031
I sensed something behind me.

1333
01:14:33,115 --> 01:14:34,699
I turned back

1334
01:14:34,783 --> 01:14:36,326
and see a bull breathing heavily.

1335
01:14:36,409 --> 01:14:38,994
He charged at me, then bam!

1336
01:14:39,078 --> 01:14:40,371
Why did the bull do that?

1337
01:14:40,454 --> 01:14:42,541
I am serious, I got a scar here to prove it!

1338
01:14:42,624 --> 01:14:43,499
I never lie!

1339
01:14:43,582 --> 01:14:46,420
- Stop it. - Don't do that.

1340
01:14:47,055 --> 01:14:48,379
How about this?

1341
01:14:48,462 --> 01:14:49,589
Have you ever defused a bomb?

1342
01:14:49,673 --> 01:14:50,799
- Bomb? - Oh my god.

1343
01:14:50,882 --> 01:14:52,801
I worked for 3 years in the bomb disposal unit.

1344
01:14:52,884 --> 01:14:54,803
- You were not scared? - Not at all.

1345
01:14:54,886 --> 01:14:57,681
Hey, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack!

1346
01:14:57,764 --> 01:15:00,475
I defused one in college on a group blind date.

1347
01:15:00,559 --> 01:15:01,809
I defused it

1348
01:15:01,892 --> 01:15:03,186
and still live with her.

1349
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:04,438
My wife, the bomb!

1350
01:15:04,521 --> 01:15:06,440
So funny, huh?

1351
01:15:06,523 --> 01:15:08,567
Hey, hey.

1352
01:15:13,029 --> 01:15:14,823
Freaking hot

1353
01:15:23,206 --> 01:15:24,290
Have a great meal.

1354
01:15:24,373 --> 01:15:25,876
You are so sweet, thank you.

1355
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:26,752
Thank you.

1356
01:15:26,835 --> 01:15:28,962
I need something for the hangover...

1357
01:15:29,045 --> 01:15:30,449
Cheol-ryung, would you like some coffee?

1358
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:32,214
No need.

1359
01:15:33,632 --> 01:15:36,219
Why do you even drink that bitter thing?

1360
01:15:39,681 --> 01:15:40,598
Thank you.

1361
01:15:43,642 --> 01:15:44,517
You too.

1362
01:15:50,274 --> 01:15:52,173
Is your eye messed up?

1363
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:53,402
Don't flirt with her.

1364
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:09,109
I scoured social media

1365
01:16:09,193 --> 01:16:11,171
and found a lead on Sergei.

1366
01:16:11,254 --> 01:16:13,507
This is a former Russian model named Natasha.

1367
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:16,425
She is presumed to be Sergei's girlfriend.

1368
01:16:17,636 --> 01:16:19,262
We will stake out near her place,

1369
01:16:19,346 --> 01:16:21,306
you guys look into Michael Cho.

1370
01:16:21,389 --> 01:16:22,302
Let's move.

1371
01:16:22,385 --> 01:16:23,892
We will cover Cho.

1372
01:16:44,788 --> 01:16:47,541
Will Sergei show up in the next 3 days?

1373
01:16:47,624 --> 01:16:48,792
We have to hope for that.

1374
01:17:05,559 --> 01:17:08,061
We seriously need a wire in there.

1375
01:17:09,186 --> 01:17:11,605
Why doesn't she ever leave?

1376
01:17:12,441 --> 01:17:14,317
Oh my...

1377
01:17:22,075 --> 01:17:24,535
How did you know we were here?

1378
01:17:24,617 --> 01:17:25,954
I asked Capt. Pyo.

1379
01:17:26,037 --> 01:17:28,595
You are so devoted.

1380
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,882
It is good, it is really good.

1381
01:17:40,468 --> 01:17:41,790
Look, she is leaving.

1382
01:17:41,874 --> 01:17:42,736
Does she have to leave

1383
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:44,222
when we are eating?

1384
01:17:45,098 --> 01:17:47,642
I am going to go plant the wire,

1385
01:17:47,726 --> 01:17:50,854
she can't be left alone, could someone tail her?

1386
01:17:50,936 --> 01:17:52,188
I will follow her.

1387
01:17:52,271 --> 01:17:53,690
You will stand out too much.

1388
01:17:54,023 --> 01:17:54,858
Then I will go!

1389
01:17:54,941 --> 01:17:56,568
You will stand out even more!

1390
01:17:57,861 --> 01:17:59,738
Then I will go with Cheol-ryung.

1391
01:17:59,821 --> 01:18:01,907
We can pretend to be a couple.

1392
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:02,824
Couple?

1393
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:06,828
Yeah, do that, but fool around.

1394
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:10,123
Good, Jack, you watch the fort here.

1395
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,417
- I am heading out. - Be careful!

1396
01:18:12,501 --> 01:18:13,585
Nice!

1397
01:18:49,747 --> 01:18:51,164
Hurry up.

1398
01:18:53,291 --> 01:18:55,046
This is so exciting,

1399
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:57,336
is all policework this thrilling?

1400
01:19:05,219 --> 01:19:07,915
Isn't my acting amazing?

1401
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,808
I think I am built for this.

1402
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,581
Isn't it weird

1403
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:14,353
that she is buying in pairs?

1404
01:19:20,526 --> 01:19:21,861
No way...

1405
01:19:41,965 --> 01:19:43,091
Look out! Look out!

1406
01:19:46,953 --> 01:19:47,757
You again?

1407
01:19:47,842 --> 01:19:48,914
I wondered where you were,

1408
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:50,139
you were hiding here?

1409
01:19:58,899 --> 01:19:59,775
Nice.

1410
01:20:03,903 --> 01:20:06,572
I don't know, I really don't!

1411
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,866
How could you not?

1412
01:20:07,949 --> 01:20:11,620
You sold a burner to Jang.

1413
01:20:11,702 --> 01:20:13,197
Let's wrap it up quickly,

1414
01:20:13,281 --> 01:20:14,579
give me the number.

1415
01:20:14,663 --> 01:20:17,707
Excuse me! Call me a lawyer!

1416
01:20:17,792 --> 01:20:19,127
Korea isn't some global pushover,

1417
01:20:19,211 --> 01:20:20,369
why did we use our tax money

1418
01:20:20,452 --> 01:20:22,255
to lawyer up a Russian?

1419
01:20:22,339 --> 01:20:24,508
That is why I settled here.

1420
01:20:24,591 --> 01:20:25,884
If I was in Russia,

1421
01:20:25,967 --> 01:20:28,512
I would be tortured and sent to Siberia.

1422
01:20:28,595 --> 01:20:32,305
Human rights here are the best!

1423
01:20:37,104 --> 01:20:38,939
I could really send you to Siberia.

1424
01:20:39,022 --> 01:20:40,190
I knew this would come up,

1425
01:20:40,273 --> 01:20:42,400
so I requested a letter of cooperation.

1426
01:20:42,484 --> 01:20:43,712
You know it is only a 2-hour flight

1427
01:20:43,796 --> 01:20:45,319
from Vladivostok.

1428
01:20:46,988 --> 01:20:47,823
Scared?

1429
01:20:53,702 --> 01:20:54,830
Buddy.

1430
01:20:54,913 --> 01:20:56,330
Vladivostok?

1431
01:20:56,998 --> 01:20:58,166
2 hours?

1432
01:20:59,251 --> 01:21:03,003
Russian officials are lazy as hell.

1433
01:21:03,087 --> 01:21:04,880
Do you know that sloth from Zootopia?

1434
01:21:06,174 --> 01:21:13,348
S-e-r-g-e-i...

1435
01:21:13,432 --> 01:21:15,183
Call me right now.

1436
01:21:15,266 --> 01:21:17,909
Why does he want me to call him to the other room?

1437
01:21:25,026 --> 01:21:26,611
Yeah, Det. Seo, what is it?

1438
01:21:26,695 --> 01:21:27,863
You wanted me to call you.

1439
01:21:27,946 --> 01:21:32,782
What? Already at the airport?

1440
01:21:32,867 --> 01:21:33,827
What airport?

1441
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:35,286
He will come straight here?

1442
01:21:35,369 --> 01:21:37,788
Tell him to get some rest before coming over.

1443
01:21:37,872 --> 01:21:39,458
What the heck are you talking about?

1444
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:40,779
Does he want to take this idiot back

1445
01:21:40,862 --> 01:21:42,586
to Vladivostok tomorrow?

1446
01:21:43,211 --> 01:21:46,259
He should check out the traditional village,

1447
01:21:46,343 --> 01:21:48,016
Gwangjang Market,

1448
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:49,843
and get some tasty gimbap while he is in town.

1449
01:21:50,677 --> 01:21:52,761
All right, then let him come.

1450
01:21:55,682 --> 01:21:57,434
Straight as an arrow.

1451
01:21:58,727 --> 01:21:59,561
Buddy.

1452
01:21:59,853 --> 01:22:01,729
I feel so bad for your pretty girlfriend,

1453
01:22:01,812 --> 01:22:03,982
Natasha.

1454
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,489
Stubborn idiot.

1455
01:22:10,571 --> 01:22:12,365
What was that about a Russian cop?

1456
01:22:12,449 --> 01:22:14,568
We got 3 countries represented,

1457
01:22:14,651 --> 01:22:15,743
and Russia should be too.

1458
01:22:15,827 --> 01:22:20,039
Jack, you said you fought off the Russian mafia, right?

1459
01:22:21,916 --> 01:22:22,790
You are...

1460
01:22:25,294 --> 01:22:26,295
No.

1461
01:22:27,005 --> 01:22:28,589
- Oh, yes. - No. No.

1462
01:22:28,672 --> 01:22:30,008
- Yes. - No no no no no.

1463
01:22:30,092 --> 01:22:30,926
Yes.

1464
01:22:35,554 --> 01:22:36,387
No.

1465
01:22:57,576 --> 01:22:59,387
This is insane.

1466
01:22:59,472 --> 01:23:03,624
I only know how to flirt and swear in Russian.

1467
01:23:03,707 --> 01:23:04,959
That is more than enough.

1468
01:23:05,459 --> 01:23:10,089
We have to get Jang no matter what.

1469
01:23:12,259 --> 01:23:13,092
Okay.

1470
01:23:13,552 --> 01:23:15,262
Come on. Come on!

1471
01:23:16,138 --> 01:23:17,596
This is so freaking stupid.

1472
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:22,967
It tears me apart

1473
01:23:23,051 --> 01:23:25,604
to send you to Siberia.

1474
01:23:25,689 --> 01:23:28,356
You know what happens

1475
01:23:28,439 --> 01:23:30,109
in the gulag sausage fest.

1476
01:23:32,654 --> 01:23:33,822
Tarkovsky!

1477
01:23:43,661 --> 01:23:45,584
Your eyes are so beautiful.

1478
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:48,170
My eyes?

1479
01:23:53,341 --> 01:23:54,925
Let's have a good time tonight.

1480
01:23:55,009 --> 01:23:56,183
I ain't spending a night with you!

1481
01:23:56,266 --> 01:23:57,095
Pervert, get back!

1482
01:23:59,181 --> 01:24:01,098
Your daddy is a freaking beggar!

1483
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,771
Where is the washroom?

1484
01:24:05,854 --> 01:24:07,061
Washroom!

1485
01:24:07,146 --> 01:24:08,060
Where is the washroom?

1486
01:24:08,144 --> 01:24:12,407
Washroom! Washroom!

1487
01:24:13,652 --> 01:24:16,490
He is insane! Please!

1488
01:24:16,573 --> 01:24:17,657
Shut your mouth!

1489
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:18,867
Hyung, hyung!

1490
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:20,489
Don't call me that,

1491
01:24:20,573 --> 01:24:21,745
I need a reason to help you.

1492
01:24:21,828 --> 01:24:22,828
- 010! - What?

1493
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:25,957
- 6742! - Buddy, input it here.

1494
01:24:38,052 --> 01:24:39,096
Begin.

1495
01:24:51,733 --> 01:24:53,609
Must we go this far?

1496
01:24:53,692 --> 01:24:56,655
Is your heart getting soft?

1497
01:24:58,115 --> 01:24:59,366
It is not that...

1498
01:24:59,824 --> 01:25:01,493
But there are innocent people...

1499
01:25:07,124 --> 01:25:10,835
Was your family killed because they were criminals?

1500
01:25:12,837 --> 01:25:13,963
We must get our revenge.

1501
01:25:17,759 --> 01:25:18,593
Of course.

1502
01:25:26,268 --> 01:25:29,104
North Korean delegation has arrived

1503
01:25:29,187 --> 01:25:31,440
through the Panmunjom today.

1504
01:25:31,523 --> 01:25:34,067
The 2-day trip will be attended by

1505
01:25:34,151 --> 01:25:37,528
Central Military Commissioner Kim Jung-taek,

1506
01:25:37,611 --> 01:25:39,089
and is expected to make a big leap

1507
01:25:39,172 --> 01:25:41,450
in the ongoing negotiation.

1508
01:25:47,539 --> 01:25:48,373
Head home now.

1509
01:25:48,747 --> 01:25:49,583
I will.

1510
01:25:50,417 --> 01:25:51,835
Got a location ping of the burner!

1511
01:25:52,961 --> 01:25:55,754
He is in a vehicle, heading toward Youngdong Bridge.

1512
01:25:55,839 --> 01:25:57,257
Where are they going?

1513
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:58,967
I got a list of calls made with the burner!

1514
01:25:59,551 --> 01:26:01,362
Jang and his men visited a club

1515
01:26:01,446 --> 01:26:04,138
owned by Cho a few days ago.

1516
01:26:04,222 --> 01:26:05,306
It is called Chroma.

1517
01:26:05,389 --> 01:26:06,807
Oh, Chroma.

1518
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:09,518
Jang visited Michael Cho?

1519
01:26:10,312 --> 01:26:12,397
- Okay, got it. - Hey, Jin-tae.

1520
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,024
We got no warrant or evidence,

1521
01:26:14,107 --> 01:26:15,734
if things go south, we are done!

1522
01:26:15,817 --> 01:26:17,360
Do I look like an idiot?

1523
01:26:17,444 --> 01:26:19,279
I will go in posing as a clubber,

1524
01:26:19,362 --> 01:26:20,989
and arrest him if I see him.

1525
01:26:21,072 --> 01:26:23,449
Jin-tae, you have never been to a club?

1526
01:26:23,532 --> 01:26:25,054
VIPs get private rooms,

1527
01:26:25,137 --> 01:26:26,161
so they won't be on the floor.

1528
01:26:26,244 --> 01:26:27,786
- Yeah? - Yup.

1529
01:26:29,121 --> 01:26:30,206
So what can we do without a warrant?

1530
01:26:30,289 --> 01:26:31,625
We can't do it right now!

1531
01:26:33,877 --> 01:26:37,547
There is one way to do it without a warrant.

1532
01:26:37,631 --> 01:26:38,506
What?

1533
01:26:38,590 --> 01:26:41,093
I was a club junkie...

1534
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:44,554
I mean, as an experienced clubber,

1535
01:26:44,638 --> 01:26:46,515
here is what happens inside.

1536
01:26:46,598 --> 01:26:49,555
Men from VIP rooms will ask me

1537
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:51,310
to join them.

1538
01:26:52,145 --> 01:26:53,644
I frequented all those rooms back

1539
01:26:53,728 --> 01:26:56,441
in my heyday.

1540
01:26:56,525 --> 01:26:57,442
What then?

1541
01:26:57,526 --> 01:26:59,944
I am a walking search warrant!

1542
01:27:16,961 --> 01:27:19,548
I am going to take a look.

1543
01:27:24,718 --> 01:27:25,679
Be careful.

1544
01:27:25,762 --> 01:27:26,501
If there is a problem,

1545
01:27:26,585 --> 01:27:27,889
I will get to you like a bullet.

1546
01:27:29,015 --> 01:27:30,141
Like a bullet?

1547
01:27:30,224 --> 01:27:34,770
A bit slower than a bullet...

1548
01:27:34,854 --> 01:27:35,814
Okay.

1549
01:27:37,065 --> 01:27:39,984
Time to execute that warrant.

1550
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:56,585
Yes, hottie confirmed.

1551
01:28:18,439 --> 01:28:19,523
Good evening!

1552
01:28:41,963 --> 01:28:45,342
South Korea sure is fancy, so many are here today.

1553
01:28:45,884 --> 01:28:46,885
Got a company dinner?

1554
01:28:48,928 --> 01:28:50,304
What is so funny?

1555
01:28:53,057 --> 01:28:54,518
I have been thinking.

1556
01:28:57,104 --> 01:28:58,979
$1 billion is stored in here,

1557
01:28:59,062 --> 01:29:00,795
and it is all mine

1558
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:02,109
if I just kill one guy.

1559
01:29:02,526 --> 01:29:03,652
What are you getting it?

1560
01:29:03,735 --> 01:29:05,781
So why the heck are you pulling out

1561
01:29:05,864 --> 01:29:08,281
when the business is good?

1562
01:29:08,365 --> 01:29:10,257
You are just a fugitive,

1563
01:29:10,341 --> 01:29:12,244
you can't even use this.

1564
01:29:14,328 --> 01:29:15,163
$5 million is enough

1565
01:29:15,247 --> 01:29:16,790
to live off somewhere in the Philippines.

1566
01:29:16,873 --> 01:29:18,792
And I will send you the living expenses too.

1567
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:20,502
Think of it as returning to a farming life.

1568
01:29:22,671 --> 01:29:25,048
I admire your guts, very well.

1569
01:29:25,132 --> 01:29:27,065
I will give it a thought

1570
01:29:27,148 --> 01:29:32,596
over a drink, yeah?

1571
01:29:35,724 --> 01:29:37,519
Bring out the Arman de Brignac set.

1572
01:29:49,781 --> 01:29:51,012
Arrived in Seoul,

1573
01:29:51,095 --> 01:29:52,409
what is the situation?

1574
01:29:56,871 --> 01:29:58,582
Waiting in ambush, hunt initiating soon.

1575
01:29:58,665 --> 01:29:59,939
Lose South, American cops, return at once.

1576
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:10,552
Excuse me for a second.

1577
01:30:20,979 --> 01:30:22,022
- What is it? - Jin-tae.

1578
01:30:22,105 --> 01:30:24,940
Cheol-ryung is hiding something from us.

1579
01:30:25,024 --> 01:30:25,816
Hiding what?

1580
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:28,487
Jang's money, the drug money, it is $1 billion.

1581
01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:29,862
He came to get that.

1582
01:30:29,945 --> 01:30:30,778
$1 billion?

1583
01:30:30,863 --> 01:30:32,198
Why are you telling me this now?

1584
01:30:32,281 --> 01:30:34,951
He wants Jang and the money.

1585
01:30:35,409 --> 01:30:37,412
Then we will be left empty-handed.

1586
01:30:37,496 --> 01:30:38,497
Listen.

1587
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:40,373
I am going after Jang.

1588
01:30:40,456 --> 01:30:41,791
You go after the money.

1589
01:30:45,128 --> 01:30:46,505
What is going on...

1590
01:30:47,546 --> 01:30:51,259
How much is $1 billion in Korean won?

1591
01:30:53,261 --> 01:30:54,553
1 trillion won?

1592
01:30:57,181 --> 01:30:58,433
You idiot!

1593
01:30:58,517 --> 01:30:59,768
We are short-staffed as is,

1594
01:30:59,851 --> 01:31:01,310
you are fooling around out here?

1595
01:31:01,394 --> 01:31:02,853
Get back to the kitchen!

1596
01:31:02,937 --> 01:31:04,441
The boss' VIP came,

1597
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:05,982
bring the Arman set to the penthouse.

1598
01:31:06,482 --> 01:31:08,484
My apologies, sir.

1599
01:31:08,567 --> 01:31:10,945
Boss' VIP, got it.

1600
01:31:14,323 --> 01:31:15,324
Hello?

1601
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:17,119
Captain.

1602
01:31:19,078 --> 01:31:20,914
I found out what the North is after.

1603
01:31:20,997 --> 01:31:21,832
What is it?

1604
01:31:36,345 --> 01:31:39,140
I was not going to care if you took some crumbs.

1605
01:31:39,223 --> 01:31:41,726
But you don't know your place yet.

1606
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:43,287
It is not about knowing my place,

1607
01:31:43,371 --> 01:31:45,939
but reading the room.

1608
01:31:46,022 --> 01:31:47,606
Do I still look like your minion?!

1609
01:31:49,818 --> 01:31:53,321
I have got to at least taste the expensive booze.

1610
01:32:20,056 --> 01:32:22,225
Please don't kill me...

1611
01:32:23,852 --> 01:32:27,271
Money is like drugs.

1612
01:32:27,606 --> 01:32:31,234
Once you get a taste, you only stop when you are dead.

1613
01:32:31,984 --> 01:32:33,570
I feel terrible for your daughter.

1614
01:32:35,154 --> 01:32:37,656
Stop, please stop, comrade Jang.

1615
01:32:38,157 --> 01:32:39,493
We got the money, please stop this.

1616
01:32:39,576 --> 01:32:42,202
You are a backstabbing idiot!

1617
01:32:42,286 --> 01:32:43,140
Did you think I would not know

1618
01:32:43,223 --> 01:32:44,623
you tipped off the FBI?

1619
01:32:44,706 --> 01:32:48,479
We pushed too far,

1620
01:32:48,562 --> 01:32:49,628
let's stop before...

1621
01:32:52,089 --> 01:32:52,923
Damn it...

1622
01:32:56,425 --> 01:32:57,469
Min-young

1623
01:33:05,602 --> 01:33:08,354
Jang is in the penthouse!

1624
01:33:08,437 --> 01:33:10,689
Min-young, please head home.

1625
01:33:26,330 --> 01:33:27,082
Jack.

1626
01:33:27,165 --> 01:33:28,417
Why? Hey!

1627
01:33:30,794 --> 01:33:31,920
Hey!

1628
01:33:32,254 --> 01:33:33,171
I am sorry.

1629
01:33:34,131 --> 01:33:35,382
Hey! Goddamn it.

1630
01:33:59,572 --> 01:34:00,574
I...

1631
01:34:00,656 --> 01:34:04,035
I am... Adolf Bormann...

1632
01:34:04,910 --> 01:34:05,995
Have to stop...

1633
01:34:07,955 --> 01:34:08,956
the massacre...

1634
01:34:10,249 --> 01:34:11,083
Let's go.

1635
01:34:25,890 --> 01:34:27,642
Get going! Hurry up!

1636
01:34:27,725 --> 01:34:30,103
Move in! On the double!

1637
01:35:35,501 --> 01:35:36,336
Cheol-ryung.

1638
01:35:37,628 --> 01:35:38,463
There he goes.

1639
01:35:41,757 --> 01:35:43,051
What are you doing?

1640
01:35:43,135 --> 01:35:44,469
Hyung, I am sorry.

1641
01:35:44,553 --> 01:35:48,640
Hey! Lim Cheol-ryung!

1642
01:36:15,542 --> 01:36:17,043
Don't fucking move!

1643
01:36:27,554 --> 01:36:30,340
I am DPRK Social Security's

1644
01:36:30,424 --> 01:36:32,267
Lt. Lim Cheol-ryung!

1645
01:36:32,350 --> 01:36:36,354
I request an escort to the North's delegation!

1646
01:36:39,106 --> 01:36:41,693
We got played again!

1647
01:36:42,194 --> 01:36:45,655
See? I told you he was up to something!

1648
01:36:45,739 --> 01:36:46,823
But you could not find out why

1649
01:36:46,907 --> 01:36:48,742
and end up in this mess?

1650
01:36:48,825 --> 01:36:51,870
I found it, but you got here too late.

1651
01:36:51,953 --> 01:36:54,079
It is $1 billion!

1652
01:36:54,163 --> 01:36:56,374
You and I will be kicked to the curve!

1653
01:36:56,458 --> 01:36:57,423
Why should I?

1654
01:36:57,507 --> 01:36:58,708
I was following my orders.

1655
01:36:58,793 --> 01:37:00,385
Then take the responsibility

1656
01:37:00,468 --> 01:37:02,839
and get back the $1 billion!

1657
01:37:03,422 --> 01:37:04,923
Sir! Sir!

1658
01:37:05,925 --> 01:37:09,805
We found Jang's vehicle near Pyeongtaek port.

1659
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:11,681
He may be trying to smuggle into China.

1660
01:37:11,765 --> 01:37:12,932
Let's go, we are wasting time.

1661
01:37:14,392 --> 01:37:16,076
We will clean up your mess,

1662
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:18,271
so fly home tomorrow.

1663
01:37:18,355 --> 01:37:20,440
Det. Kang, go rest up at home.

1664
01:37:20,524 --> 01:37:22,692
I will make sure you rest for good this time.

1665
01:37:22,776 --> 01:37:25,194
This is all I get for risking my life?

1666
01:37:26,488 --> 01:37:27,614
Is that it?

1667
01:37:28,031 --> 01:37:29,658
I will follow you to Pyeongtaek, sir!

1668
01:37:30,241 --> 01:37:32,786
Stop getting in the way,

1669
01:37:32,869 --> 01:37:34,745
and go retrieve the wiretaps at Kang's home.

1670
01:37:34,829 --> 01:37:35,789
Wiretaps?

1671
01:37:36,289 --> 01:37:38,374
Did you think we just trust you?

1672
01:37:38,457 --> 01:37:39,543
Are you naive or something?

1673
01:37:39,625 --> 01:37:42,020
No wonder you got backstabbed

1674
01:37:42,104 --> 01:37:43,338
by Lim Cheol-ryung twice!

1675
01:37:43,422 --> 01:37:44,464
I have had it.

1676
01:37:44,548 --> 01:37:45,424
What?

1677
01:37:45,507 --> 01:37:47,341
How dare you say that?

1678
01:37:59,187 --> 01:38:03,400
North Korean Delegation Hotel

1679
01:38:07,361 --> 01:38:09,905
Good work, what about Kim Cheol-su?

1680
01:38:09,989 --> 01:38:11,450
He is dead, sir.

1681
01:38:11,533 --> 01:38:13,577
All of the party's threats are now eliminated.

1682
01:38:25,046 --> 01:38:26,173
Good to see you.

1683
01:38:27,674 --> 01:38:30,594
Comrade Lim Cheol-ryung wrapped up this case.

1684
01:38:30,676 --> 01:38:33,555
Is that so? Good work.

1685
01:38:34,637 --> 01:38:35,974
The Swiss bank security key?

1686
01:38:48,527 --> 01:38:50,697
You are the true hero of our party.

1687
01:38:51,823 --> 01:38:53,700
I promise you a huge reward.

1688
01:39:07,631 --> 01:39:09,407
The German chemist who created

1689
01:39:09,491 --> 01:39:12,219
poisonous gas used on Jews...

1690
01:39:13,386 --> 01:39:15,889
I am... Adolf Bormann...

1691
01:39:16,389 --> 01:39:17,265
Have to stop...

1692
01:39:18,981 --> 01:39:19,999
the massacre...

1693
01:39:25,732 --> 01:39:29,193
Lim Cheol-ryung

1694
01:39:37,701 --> 01:39:39,788
The US-North Korea meeting ended

1695
01:39:39,871 --> 01:39:41,540
without a resolution today

1696
01:39:41,622 --> 01:39:43,874
after stating each other's stances.

1697
01:39:43,958 --> 01:39:47,170
North's representative Kim Jung-taek

1698
01:39:47,254 --> 01:39:49,860
criticized the U.S. for coming to the table

1699
01:39:49,944 --> 01:39:51,435
without any offers.

1700
01:39:51,519 --> 01:39:52,426
Lim Cheol-ryung

1701
01:39:52,509 --> 01:39:55,511
The North delegation will return...

1702
01:39:55,594 --> 01:39:56,762
What do you want?

1703
01:39:56,846 --> 01:39:58,056
Your informant was Kim Cheol-su.

1704
01:39:58,140 --> 01:39:59,765
He said a massacre needs to be stopped before he died.

1705
01:39:59,849 --> 01:40:01,985
His alias Bormann was a Nazi chemist officer

1706
01:40:02,068 --> 01:40:04,187
who massacred Jews...

1707
01:40:07,106 --> 01:40:08,275
This could be bad.

1708
01:40:09,733 --> 01:40:11,361
It is too late.

1709
01:40:11,445 --> 01:40:13,530
I am going home.

1710
01:40:27,711 --> 01:40:28,712
I am home.

1711
01:40:34,301 --> 01:40:35,594
You are a bit late.

1712
01:40:49,147 --> 01:40:50,774
Hey, Jack.

1713
01:40:51,919 --> 01:40:53,153
Is your flight heading out soon?

1714
01:40:53,236 --> 01:40:54,069
Yes. Hey, listen.

1715
01:40:54,153 --> 01:40:56,490
There is something I need you to check for me first.

1716
01:40:56,573 --> 01:40:58,574
Something the informant said before he died.

1717
01:40:58,657 --> 01:41:00,074
Who cares what Kim Cheol-su said?

1718
01:41:00,158 --> 01:41:01,264
It is over now.

1719
01:41:02,454 --> 01:41:03,497
How did you know his name?

1720
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:10,169
I mean, lucky guess, I guess.

1721
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:12,631
Jack?

1722
01:41:21,389 --> 01:41:23,057
Traitor-ass motherfucker.

1723
01:42:18,572 --> 01:42:19,613
Oh, shit.

1724
01:42:30,124 --> 01:42:31,750
I am incredibly honored!

1725
01:42:33,086 --> 01:42:35,666
The almighty comrade Kim Jung-taek

1726
01:42:35,749 --> 01:42:38,800
came here to catch a nobody.

1727
01:42:47,559 --> 01:42:52,189
Your damn mouth is still alive and kicking.

1728
01:42:53,732 --> 01:42:54,516
I believed your word

1729
01:42:54,599 --> 01:42:56,109
that our people can be saved

1730
01:42:56,193 --> 01:42:58,569
by bringing in dollars,

1731
01:42:58,652 --> 01:43:00,589
and I tossed the soldier's honor

1732
01:43:00,672 --> 01:43:02,741
to peddle drugs,

1733
01:43:02,823 --> 01:43:07,120
but that money went into just one idiot's mouth.

1734
01:43:09,163 --> 01:43:13,292
You should have just stuck to your orders.

1735
01:43:13,376 --> 01:43:15,212
You clued in too quickly.

1736
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,713
My boss was the traitor.

1737
01:43:17,797 --> 01:43:21,341
Jang Myung-jun knew everything, every move we made.

1738
01:43:21,425 --> 01:43:23,553
So, why was he caught?

1739
01:43:23,637 --> 01:43:25,555
- Caught on purpose? - Yes!

1740
01:43:25,639 --> 01:43:28,599
And those guys are targeting Jin-tae's family.

1741
01:43:28,681 --> 01:43:30,435
I will save his family,

1742
01:43:30,519 --> 01:43:32,436
you go after Jang.

1743
01:43:42,364 --> 01:43:44,198
Is he training a mutt or something?

1744
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:47,410
Hey, hey hey.

1745
01:43:47,494 --> 01:43:49,119
You know me, right?

1746
01:43:49,203 --> 01:43:50,955
What? Yes.

1747
01:43:54,251 --> 01:43:55,252
Hey, rookie.

1748
01:43:55,627 --> 01:43:58,255
Would you like to cooperate with the FBI?

1749
01:43:59,297 --> 01:44:00,382
Really?

1750
01:44:01,174 --> 01:44:03,717
Mom, I am so scared...

1751
01:44:05,427 --> 01:44:06,971
Don't worry.

1752
01:44:07,972 --> 01:44:10,934
Dad will come to save us like last time.

1753
01:44:11,017 --> 01:44:13,352
It is okay, don't cry.

1754
01:44:23,321 --> 01:44:24,988
May I check your ID?

1755
01:44:26,615 --> 01:44:28,492
Seoul Metro Police, Kang Jin-tae.

1756
01:44:36,293 --> 01:44:37,127
Thank you for your cooperation.

1757
01:44:37,210 --> 01:44:38,127
Good.

1758
01:44:53,477 --> 01:44:54,352
Could we get some food?

1759
01:44:55,686 --> 01:44:56,475
Food?

1760
01:44:56,558 --> 01:44:58,732
No, we don't want to eat.

1761
01:44:58,815 --> 01:44:59,669
We're all doing this

1762
01:44:59,753 --> 01:45:01,276
so that we don't starve.

1763
01:45:01,359 --> 01:45:02,235
- Hey! - What's with you?

1764
01:45:02,319 --> 01:45:03,737
Could you at least order us Chinese?

1765
01:45:03,819 --> 01:45:05,405
Are you able to eat right now?

1766
01:45:05,489 --> 01:45:07,365
We collected a ton of coupons.

1767
01:45:07,449 --> 01:45:09,910
We did that so we can order sweet and sour pork!

1768
01:45:09,993 --> 01:45:12,328
I want to use them all before I die!

1769
01:45:12,411 --> 01:45:13,997
Our corpses will look better.

1770
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,247
- I want double portion! - Hey!

1771
01:45:15,332 --> 01:45:16,124
Double portion?

1772
01:45:16,208 --> 01:45:17,793
- Please don't mind her... - I want double!

1773
01:45:17,876 --> 01:45:18,709
- I have to have it! - No, don't listen to her.

1774
01:45:18,793 --> 01:45:19,835
Is she out of her mind?

1775
01:45:19,919 --> 01:45:21,129
Pick something!

1776
01:45:21,213 --> 01:45:22,047
Shut the heck up!

1777
01:45:22,714 --> 01:45:24,256
- Please forgive her... - Now.

1778
01:45:24,548 --> 01:45:26,926
She inhaled a lot of carbon monoxide as a kid...

1779
01:45:29,178 --> 01:45:30,222
Anyone home?

1780
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:32,766
I came with an important message.

1781
01:45:38,396 --> 01:45:39,856
You can kill me,

1782
01:45:41,315 --> 01:45:44,778
but please let my family go.

1783
01:45:49,157 --> 01:45:52,035
Shut up. You will see them soon.

1784
01:45:53,953 --> 01:45:56,080
I came with an important message.

1785
01:46:11,513 --> 01:46:13,432
Jack came to rescue us!

1786
01:47:02,771 --> 01:47:05,567
Min-young, watch out!

1787
01:47:10,154 --> 01:47:12,240
Min-young, open the door! Open the door!

1788
01:47:12,324 --> 01:47:13,450
Hurry!

1789
01:47:27,756 --> 01:47:28,590
Good job.

1790
01:47:29,298 --> 01:47:30,132
Thank you.

1791
01:47:41,394 --> 01:47:43,230
The main server is under control.

1792
01:47:58,077 --> 01:47:58,911
What is it?

1793
01:47:59,703 --> 01:48:00,538
You idiot!

1794
01:48:09,256 --> 01:48:12,341
Jacked in, shutting off elevators.

1795
01:48:38,993 --> 01:48:40,703
- Honey! - Sweetie!

1796
01:48:40,787 --> 01:48:41,912
You okay?

1797
01:48:41,996 --> 01:48:42,913
Yeah, I am fine.

1798
01:48:42,997 --> 01:48:45,166
We are okay too, Jack rescued us.

1799
01:48:45,249 --> 01:48:46,501
Don't worry about us.

1800
01:48:46,585 --> 01:48:47,518
Good...

1801
01:48:47,602 --> 01:48:48,503
Under Maintenance

1802
01:48:48,587 --> 01:48:49,963
Dammit!

1803
01:48:55,759 --> 01:48:56,594
Ready to transfer, sir.

1804
01:48:56,886 --> 01:48:58,972
Move all $1 billion to my account.

1805
01:48:59,055 --> 01:49:00,389
Yes, sir.

1806
01:49:06,395 --> 01:49:09,232
They are connected, initiating a hack.

1807
01:49:14,988 --> 01:49:17,324
- What is wrong? - We are being hacked.

1808
01:49:18,782 --> 01:49:19,534
What is this?

1809
01:49:19,618 --> 01:49:20,911
Money is being taken out of the account.

1810
01:49:20,994 --> 01:49:23,246
You moron, then stop them!

1811
01:49:23,330 --> 01:49:24,288
Right away, sir.

1812
01:49:35,133 --> 01:49:36,259
Freaking idiot!

1813
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:38,220
You must enter the tiger's den

1814
01:49:38,304 --> 01:49:39,553
to catch the tiger.

1815
01:50:18,927 --> 01:50:21,846
Do you know how long I prepped

1816
01:50:22,486 --> 01:50:24,974
to get you outside the country?

1817
01:50:25,434 --> 01:50:28,437
Take it all, I don't need it.

1818
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:31,355
Then why did you kill my innocent family?

1819
01:50:32,481 --> 01:50:35,444
Isn't it a husband and a father's duty

1820
01:50:35,527 --> 01:50:38,363
to go to hell and back to seek revenge?

1821
01:50:38,447 --> 01:50:41,490
Listen, Myung-jun.

1822
01:52:38,775 --> 01:52:39,901
What are you planning?

1823
01:52:41,278 --> 01:52:42,529
And what about the poison?

1824
01:52:47,159 --> 01:52:49,202
5 minutes after pressing this,

1825
01:52:49,286 --> 01:52:53,038
poisonous gas will be released from the roof of this building.

1826
01:52:53,122 --> 01:52:56,710
Any living beings within a 3km radius will perish.

1827
01:52:56,793 --> 01:53:00,629
Isn't it a brilliant plan?

1828
01:53:02,423 --> 01:53:04,758
And this is for the fallen comrades...

1829
01:53:17,396 --> 01:53:18,231
Hyung.

1830
01:53:18,647 --> 01:53:19,900
I am sorry about yesterday.

1831
01:53:19,983 --> 01:53:22,725
Shut it, our detail isn't over.

1832
01:53:25,197 --> 01:53:26,572
They are trying to release poisonous gas.

1833
01:53:26,655 --> 01:53:28,992
He is a stereotypical villain.

1834
01:53:31,619 --> 01:53:32,454
Cover me.

1835
01:53:32,786 --> 01:53:33,747
What?

1836
01:53:34,331 --> 01:53:35,582
Okay, got it.

1837
01:54:30,137 --> 01:54:31,388
Hey, Lim Cheol-ryung!

1838
01:54:43,191 --> 01:54:44,192
Idiot...

1839
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:31,114
Enough! You are finished!

1840
01:55:33,325 --> 01:55:37,346
You have crossed 2 lines you should not have.

1841
01:55:37,954 --> 01:55:41,207
First, you entered South Korean territory.

1842
01:55:41,290 --> 01:55:43,000
Second,

1843
01:55:43,085 --> 01:55:45,295
you messed with my family.

1844
01:55:45,378 --> 01:55:47,756
So what, you weak as heck.

1845
01:56:56,490 --> 01:56:58,910
Cheol-ryung! Are you okay?

1846
01:57:00,454 --> 01:57:01,495
Where is the bomb?

1847
01:57:02,789 --> 01:57:04,331
- It is over there! - Okay!

1848
01:57:06,124 --> 01:57:09,337
Will you kill innocent people?

1849
01:57:09,421 --> 01:57:10,796
How are they innocent?

1850
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:14,342
My daughter and wife were burned alive.

1851
01:57:14,426 --> 01:57:16,554
If the South allowed asylum,

1852
01:57:16,637 --> 01:57:19,222
they would not have died.

1853
01:57:19,806 --> 01:57:24,811
South Koreans should taste what hell is like as well.

1854
01:57:53,215 --> 01:57:54,049
Jack!

1855
01:57:54,132 --> 01:57:56,635
Look, it is a poisonous gas bomb.

1856
01:57:56,718 --> 01:57:57,468
What do you mean?

1857
01:57:57,551 --> 01:57:58,552
Poison!

1858
01:57:58,637 --> 01:58:00,430
Honey, we are almost there...

1859
01:58:00,514 --> 01:58:03,183
You can't come here...

1860
01:58:03,266 --> 01:58:05,851
I don't believe it, Jack, what do I do?

1861
01:58:05,935 --> 01:58:07,171
I got less than 3 minutes.

1862
01:58:07,255 --> 01:58:08,123
If I don't defuse it,

1863
01:58:08,207 --> 01:58:09,397
we are all dead.

1864
01:58:09,481 --> 01:58:10,732
Why are you asking me that?

1865
01:58:11,315 --> 01:58:13,234
You said you were in the bomb disposal unit!

1866
01:58:13,317 --> 01:58:15,278
Oh my god! It was a long...

1867
01:58:15,362 --> 01:58:17,906
I know, I know, it was a long time ago.

1868
01:58:18,197 --> 01:58:19,282
Can't you help? Please?

1869
01:58:19,365 --> 01:58:21,826
- Wait, wait... - What do we do!

1870
01:58:22,827 --> 01:58:24,119
Hole, that hole.

1871
01:58:24,203 --> 01:58:25,996
Deactivation key, key!

1872
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:26,915
Key?

1873
01:58:26,998 --> 01:58:28,333
There is a key there, you have got to find the key.

1874
01:58:28,417 --> 01:58:29,209
Right, key!

1875
01:58:29,292 --> 01:58:30,752
I see it, I see it!

1876
01:58:32,003 --> 01:58:33,004
Dammit!

1877
01:58:37,842 --> 01:58:39,176
- You can't go in there! - Hold on!

1878
01:58:39,261 --> 01:58:40,970
- They are Jin-tae's family. - Hello, there.

1879
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:42,973
- Captain! - Why are you here?

1880
01:58:43,056 --> 01:58:44,683
Jin-tae is up there right now.

1881
01:58:45,223 --> 01:58:47,018
There is a bomb on the roof!

1882
01:58:47,394 --> 01:58:49,688
Hey, hey, this is an emergency.

1883
01:59:33,451 --> 01:59:34,369
Cheol-ryung!

1884
01:59:35,370 --> 01:59:36,287
Key!

1885
01:59:36,371 --> 01:59:38,790
We have got to find a key that deactivates the bomb!

1886
01:59:42,252 --> 01:59:45,422
Give me the key.

1887
01:59:51,303 --> 01:59:52,649
I will finally get

1888
01:59:53,285 --> 01:59:57,767
to see my daughter and wife.

1889
01:59:58,810 --> 02:00:00,103
Lim Cheol-ryung.

1890
02:00:01,313 --> 02:00:05,275
It would be best if we don't meet again.

1891
02:00:09,904 --> 02:00:11,072
No!

1892
02:00:27,339 --> 02:00:28,173
Radio them.

1893
02:00:50,945 --> 02:00:52,322
Look!

1894
02:00:52,405 --> 02:00:53,239
Get the key.

1895
02:00:58,662 --> 02:01:00,121
Closer!

1896
02:01:00,205 --> 02:01:03,041
- One second, sir. - A bit more!

1897
02:01:11,466 --> 02:01:12,300
Now!

1898
02:01:15,095 --> 02:01:16,554
Cheol-ryung!

1899
02:02:01,182 --> 02:02:04,686
Hyung, by the way...

1900
02:02:06,354 --> 02:02:07,647
are we okay to go home?

1901
02:02:09,607 --> 02:02:11,526
Your wife will kill us.

1902
02:02:16,239 --> 02:02:18,241
We can just kneel!

1903
02:02:21,494 --> 02:02:22,662
Hey, Jack!

1904
02:02:25,123 --> 02:02:27,125
Hyung, are you okay?

1905
02:02:27,208 --> 02:02:30,063
I am okay, thank you so much.

1906
02:02:30,629 --> 02:02:32,047
Did you just call me 'hyung'?

1907
02:02:33,882 --> 02:02:36,468
I said "Huh? Are you okay?"

1908
02:02:36,801 --> 02:02:39,308
Not 'hyung', I said, "Huh? Are you okay?"

1909
02:02:39,846 --> 02:02:40,981
He uses English only

1910
02:02:41,064 --> 02:02:42,794
when he is at a disadvantage.

1911
02:02:52,497 --> 02:02:53,902
What should I do with this?

1912
02:02:55,153 --> 02:02:56,016
If you take it,

1913
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:58,114
do you think it will really be used for food?

1914
02:03:01,076 --> 02:03:02,285
I got an idea.

1915
02:03:04,371 --> 02:03:05,538
What kind?

1916
02:03:05,872 --> 02:03:07,040
Wait and see.

1917
02:03:28,683 --> 02:03:30,313
Oh my god, I must have gone insane...

1918
02:03:30,397 --> 02:03:33,316
Min-young, I see it, I see him in slow motion...

1919
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:35,151
- Oh gosh... - You see it?

1920
02:03:35,235 --> 02:03:37,612
I see it, that is incredible!

1921
02:03:37,696 --> 02:03:40,156
I don't believe it, honey!

1922
02:03:40,240 --> 02:03:43,868
- Dad! - Honey, get over here!

1923
02:03:43,952 --> 02:03:45,954
Come here, you fool!

1924
02:04:05,546 --> 02:04:07,495
UNICEF has donated $1 billion

1925
02:04:07,579 --> 02:04:09,926
to help aid North Korea's food shortage.

1926
02:04:10,009 --> 02:04:12,407
The donor and the source of donation

1927
02:04:12,491 --> 02:04:15,223
are receiving attention.

1928
02:04:15,306 --> 02:04:17,675
UNICEF has stated that as per request,

1929
02:04:17,759 --> 02:04:19,814
they won't identify the donor.

1930
02:04:24,565 --> 02:04:26,734
Hyung, I am sorry.

1931
02:04:26,818 --> 02:04:27,652
For what?

1932
02:04:27,985 --> 02:04:30,238
You didn't get the promotion because of me.

1933
02:04:31,447 --> 02:04:33,366
I never wanted a promotion,

1934
02:04:33,449 --> 02:04:34,659
I am just glad I didn't get fired.

1935
02:04:34,742 --> 02:04:37,495
It was a really good idea.

1936
02:04:38,371 --> 02:04:40,601
And I have to keep on living like this.

1937
02:04:42,208 --> 02:04:43,376
Be well.

1938
02:04:45,712 --> 02:04:46,754
Take care.

1939
02:04:53,511 --> 02:04:55,763
Cheol-ryung, I will wait for you.

1940
02:04:55,847 --> 02:04:56,764
Will you wait?

1941
02:04:57,140 --> 02:04:58,891
Yes, I will wait.

1942
02:04:58,975 --> 02:05:00,268
Jeez...

1943
02:05:11,154 --> 02:05:13,698
Min-young, have you been to the States?

1944
02:05:14,490 --> 02:05:15,324
Never.

1945
02:05:15,908 --> 02:05:19,579
Would you like to join me when I head back?

1946
02:05:19,871 --> 02:05:21,706
- Seriously? - Yeah.

1947
02:05:23,291 --> 02:05:24,375
Look.

1948
02:05:25,293 --> 02:05:26,377
Why is he coming back?

1949
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:32,175
Hey!

1950
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:33,843
Don't flirt with her.

1951
02:05:37,263 --> 02:05:38,514
Oh gosh...

1952
02:05:41,642 --> 02:05:42,477
For me?

1953
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:48,691
- Oh gosh... - So cool.

1954
02:05:48,775 --> 02:05:49,692
Jeez...

1955
02:05:50,902 --> 02:05:52,153
Thank you, Cheol-ryung.

1956
02:05:56,240 --> 02:05:57,075
I will wait for you!

1957
02:05:57,825 --> 02:05:59,202
Cheol-ryung!

1958
02:06:00,745 --> 02:06:03,414
Oh my god!

1959
02:06:03,498 --> 02:06:05,958
You finally won him over.

1960
02:06:06,042 --> 02:06:07,126
Don't touch it.

1961
02:06:07,210 --> 02:06:09,545
Congrats, congrats!
