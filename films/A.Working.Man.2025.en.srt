1
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:42,683
- Boss. This for you.
- No, no, no. Come on.

2
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:44,652
I can’t impose on your family.

3
00:03:44,653 --> 00:03:45,081
No.

4
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:48,986
Yasmin, she made this
just for you.

5
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:50,824
<i>Jefe,</i> please.

6
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:52,727
Take it.

7
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,894
Tell her thank you.

8
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,600
Yeah.

9
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,195
So, listen.

10
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,097
Today’s gonna be hard.

11
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:04,441
- We got inspections all day.

12
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:06,740
Forms to build,
forms to break down

13
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:08,478
and deliveries
all gettin’ in our way.

14
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,350
- We work hard today,

15
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:13,109
there’ll be a bonus for ya.

16
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,079
Understand?

17
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,850
And let’s all go home

18
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:20,358
with the same amount
of fingers that we came with.

19
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:23,053
- All right.

20
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,462
- <i>Hermanos.
-</i>

21
00:04:25,463 --> 00:04:28,124
Have a good day.
Let’s get it.

22
00:04:42,678 --> 00:04:44,943
- Morning, Jess.
<i>- Buenos dias,</i> Levon.

23
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:46,010
- How you doing?
- I’m good.

24
00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:47,418
<i>- Gracias.</i>
- Hey, Levon.

25
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,453
No one’s been asking you
for money today?

26
00:04:49,454 --> 00:04:50,080
No.

27
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,950
- Why?
- Because, apparently,

28
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:53,721
I am the only person
in the family

29
00:04:53,722 --> 00:04:55,250
who can do
the vendor accounting.

30
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:56,427
Oh, excuse me!

31
00:04:56,428 --> 00:04:57,923
Hey, I guess we’re
evil parents, babe, huh?

32
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:00,299
’Cause we make her work
a couple hours.

33
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,794
Not today.

34
00:05:00,795 --> 00:05:02,499
How about you get those
disbursements done, huh?

35
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,996
We got a line of trucks
out there that need paying.

36
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:06,030
You could pay me.

37
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:07,901
Pay you for what?

38
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:09,968
For 19 years of free rent,

39
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:11,772
and groceries,
and high school,

40
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:13,741
college, makeup,
karate classes?

41
00:05:13,742 --> 00:05:15,875
- You want me to keep goin’?
- Really? No. It’s okay.

42
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:17,845
Levon,
can you sign that, please?

43
00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:19,714
- Dad?
- What?

44
00:05:19,715 --> 00:05:21,276
- Today is a total shitshow.
- I know.

45
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:22,816
And you scheduled
three things at once.

46
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:25,049
- She’s not wrong.

47
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,425
Hi, yeah. This is Garcia
and Family Construction.

48
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:28,558
Yeah, you’re speaking
with Carla,

49
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:29,526
you’ve had me on hold
for a bit now.

50
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:31,363
So, we’re gettin’ those
deliveries today, right?

51
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,257
Yeah, I’ll hold.

52
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,534
This is
what I need for tonight.

53
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:40,735
That’s insane. What is that?
Is that for your wedding
or something?

54
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:42,473
- No, it’s for tonight.

55
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:45,443
We finished the semester,
so we’re gonna celebrate.

56
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,302
I mean, you just finished
one semester.

57
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:49,744
- Right. It’s a big milestone.
- Is it?

58
00:05:49,745 --> 00:05:51,306
- Yes.
- Is that a thing?

59
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:52,648
Look, it could be worse, okay?

60
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:54,386
- Look, I’m passing the hat.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

61
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,816
- That gets us a party van.
- Oh, my God.

62
00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:57,180
Locks in a private room
for dinner.

63
00:05:57,181 --> 00:05:58,082
Just saving like crazy.

64
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,394
Yeah.
I just need a card on file.

65
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:03,758
<i>Mija,</i> I can’t. I don’t...

66
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,189
<i>Mija...</i>

67
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:08,499
Okay, fine. I don’t need it.

68
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,962
Just give her what she wants.

69
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:12,063
No, Mom,
I can fight my own battles.

70
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:15,001
Oh, no, no,
nobody’s arguing that.

71
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,270
I mean, everybody needs
a party bus, right?

72
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:24,076
After they finish
one semester. Here.

73
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:26,419
Thank you.

74
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:33,821
Hey, Kate.

75
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,674
Excuse me.

76
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:52,070
He needs to get back to work.

77
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:55,206
Get the fuck out of here.
It’s not your business.

78
00:06:55,338 --> 00:06:56,173
I’m good, boss.

79
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:58,715
All good. Five minutes.

80
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,468
Hey!

81
00:07:27,975 --> 00:07:32,078
Hold on.
Put down your weapons.

82
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,150
I was respectful.

83
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:39,987
You weren’t.

84
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:45,124
Get outta here. Get up.

85
00:07:45,355 --> 00:07:46,664
Don’t come back.

86
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:50,965
<i>- Vamonos.</i>
- <i>Vamonos.</i>

87
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:02,580
You okay?

88
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:03,845
How did you do that?

89
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,114
We need to get back to work.

90
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,919
This one.
Over to the right.

91
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,690
- You got it.
- Thanks, Kate.

92
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:16,495
Levon! Holy fuck!

93
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,090
Was that some military shit?

94
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:20,027
You didn’t see anything.

95
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:22,567
If Dad knew, he’d shit bricks.

96
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:24,426
Can you teach me?

97
00:08:24,427 --> 00:08:26,934
Look, my grandpa,
he was a paratrooper.

98
00:08:26,935 --> 00:08:29,102
Taught me
how to break fingers,

99
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,873
track animals.

100
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:32,302
Break fingers?

101
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,006
Yeah.

102
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:36,372
Grandma made you tinga.
Shredded chicken.

103
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:37,241
It’s good.

104
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:41,312
And Grandma made you some
handmade grandma tortillas.

105
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,522
Why is everyone
always feeding me?

106
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,824
If we don’t, you’ll just eat
canned tuna and peanut butter.

107
00:08:49,188 --> 00:08:50,859
You didn’t see anything, okay?

108
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,487
Snitches get stitches.

109
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:54,533
Just get my back
if I ever need it.

110
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,865
Sure, Jenny.

111
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:57,537
See ya.

112
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:31,427
Love you, Daddy.

113
00:09:31,428 --> 00:09:33,968
Love you, too, honey.
Get in the truck.

114
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:40,139
What’s the occasion?

115
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,371
No occasion.

116
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,813
Meredith’s entertaining
some friends.

117
00:09:43,814 --> 00:09:44,110
Yeah.

118
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:47,587
I didn’t realize today
was your visitation.

119
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:50,655
You could let her stay.

120
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,448
Yeah, please, Doctor Roth,
we don’t have to do this.

121
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:54,120
You weren’t there
when her mother needed you

122
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:56,959
and you won’t be there
when Meredith needs you,

123
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:58,697
but I will.

124
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:02,261
Oh, I know.

125
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,802
You want to strike me.

126
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:07,739
It’s your only answer.

127
00:10:08,465 --> 00:10:09,873
Violence.

128
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:16,572
You’re an unsafe parent.

129
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:18,342
You’re a killer.

130
00:10:18,343 --> 00:10:20,950
You can’t pretend
that you’re not.

131
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:27,923
Excuse me, Doctor Roth.

132
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:36,768
Today’s my day.

133
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:41,102
Why’s your grandfather
throwing a party on my day?

134
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:44,500
I’m super hungry.
I didn’t eat.

135
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:46,008
I was waiting for you.

136
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:48,241
You were?

137
00:10:48,538 --> 00:10:49,682
Yeah.

138
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:53,851
Okay. Let’s go.

139
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:55,984
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

140
00:10:55,985 --> 00:10:57,514
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

141
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:04,927
I don’t need you buying stuff.

142
00:11:04,928 --> 00:11:07,293
Come on. Open it.

143
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:21,043
It’s Mama.

144
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:25,211
I took that picture

145
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:28,347
with a film camera
my dad gave me.

146
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:31,790
Grandpa took
all of Mama’s pictures down.

147
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,222
Sometimes I forget
what she looks like.

148
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:38,126
She looks like you.

149
00:11:42,526 --> 00:11:44,527
Dad, can I tell you something?

150
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:45,804
Anything.

151
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,668
I’m mad at Mama.

152
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,408
For dying and leaving us.

153
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,051
It’s okay.

154
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:04,647
I hurt, too.

155
00:12:17,594 --> 00:12:19,167
Matt will see you now.

156
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:28,781
He’s throwing parties for her
during my visitation time.

157
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:31,541
Staring at me, laughing.

158
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,048
He’s baiting you.

159
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:35,216
Hoping you throw a punch.

160
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:36,921
Nah.

161
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,923
Then he wins.

162
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:40,385
Opposing counsel

163
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:42,827
alleges you have
untreated PTSD

164
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,962
and brain trauma
from your military service,

165
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:47,557
making you
at-risk for violence.

166
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:52,166
I served Britain, the country
of my birth, for 22 years.

167
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,367
I’m the fuckin’ bad guy
for it?

168
00:12:57,172 --> 00:12:58,734
It gets worse.

169
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:02,242
They’re requesting
supervised visits

170
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:06,048
and a reduction in visitation
from two hours a week

171
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:07,918
to one hour every two.

172
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,480
I have to fight this.

173
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:11,284
I have ten grand saved up.

174
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:13,088
From sleeping
in your truck?

175
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:14,287
Court won’t be thrilled

176
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:15,860
by your lack
of a fixed residence.

177
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:16,861
Hey, I’ll figure it out.

178
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,931
Why does Doctor Roth
hate you so much?

179
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,329
He thinks
I killed his daughter.

180
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,936
Did you?

181
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,466
It was suicide.

182
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:31,734
I was overseas
on a deployment.

183
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:36,111
She battled depression
her whole life.

184
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:38,146
You’ve heard
of attrition warfare?

185
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:40,643
Yeah. You grind
the enemy down slowly.

186
00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:42,348
This guy’s got a team

187
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:44,922
of thousand-dollar-an-hour
attorneys

188
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:46,022
who will bleed you dry

189
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:48,520
until you turn to dust
and blow away.

190
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:51,930
The best we can do
is negotiated surrender.

191
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:53,866
You have a daughter?

192
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:08,143
I got you guys
a little somethin’.

193
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:09,243
Nina.

194
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:09,947
Jocelyn...

195
00:14:09,948 --> 00:14:12,015
- Chantel. And Rubi.
- Thanks, Mama.

196
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:13,544
Dude, these are insane!

197
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:14,611
Where’d you get these?

198
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:16,745
I have a cousin. Or seven.

199
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:18,483
<i>Salud</i> , bitches!

200
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:42,882
Thank you.

201
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,936
- Shots.

202
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:37,859
Hey!

203
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,827
What? What? What?

204
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:40,400
What the fuck
are we still doing here?

205
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:41,797
He said he wants the One.

206
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:43,766
"I want the One.
I want the fucking One."

207
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:44,866
What the fuck does that mean?

208
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,769
He’ll know it
when he sees her, okay?

209
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,243
Do you know
how much fuckin’ money

210
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:49,343
we’re gonna make on this?

211
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:52,545
- We better.
- Enjoy, yeah?

212
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,658
Hey, last establishment.

213
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:09,231
You guys have early flights.

214
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:17,141
Is that back table open?

215
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,012
It’s yours
if you tell me your name.

216
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,442
It’s Jenny.

217
00:16:22,443 --> 00:16:24,478
Hi, I’m Johnny.

218
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:26,249
Hi, Johnny.

219
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:29,648
Right here.

220
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,036
My man.

221
00:16:45,598 --> 00:16:47,566
You are more
than a pitch deck.

222
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,437
- Nina?

223
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:52,703
- Nina, don’t throw up.
- I’m fine.

224
00:16:52,704 --> 00:16:54,474
She’s making her puke face.

225
00:16:54,475 --> 00:16:57,213
- Let’s get you to a bathroom.
- Oh, ew.

226
00:16:57,214 --> 00:17:00,151
Cheap! Bad energy.

227
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:09,225
Ew!

228
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:11,227
- Oh, my God.

229
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:14,263
I hate you so much right now,
it’s not funny.

230
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:15,694
It’s kinda funny.

231
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:20,929
Oh, my God, I look mad busted.

232
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,502
I cannot go out there
like this.

233
00:17:22,503 --> 00:17:25,835
Okay, well, pick your battles,
’cause we’re leavin’ in 30.

234
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,595
Fuck!

235
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:56,107
Go.

236
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,563
Jenny’s missing.

237
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:26,137
What do you mean, "missing"?

238
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,738
She went out
with her friends on Friday.

239
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,146
Saturday, we were worried,

240
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:38,216
so we called the cops,
and then on Sunday...

241
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:41,647
She had a piano recital
on Sunday night.

242
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:43,881
We invited half our family.

243
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:48,291
My cousin Dinora
is a Police Captain in Philly,

244
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,161
and she says
they don’t work these cases.

245
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,231
They take a report
and forget about it.

246
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:54,990
Can you help us?

247
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:57,762
I can keep the site
running smoothly.

248
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:59,138
No. Help us find Jen.

249
00:19:01,063 --> 00:19:02,900
My dad was a Green Beret.

250
00:19:03,505 --> 00:19:06,145
I can see you guys
comin’ a mile away.

251
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,807
You hunt bad guys.

252
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:10,544
You jump outta planes.

253
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:13,746
And you get those bad guys.

254
00:19:14,846 --> 00:19:17,013
I’m a different person now.

255
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:21,787
All right, well,

256
00:19:22,018 --> 00:19:24,922
maybe this’ll help her.

257
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:29,762
Here, it’s 50.

258
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:30,630
Take it.

259
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:32,731
We have another 20
for expenses.

260
00:19:32,732 --> 00:19:33,864
Come on, just take it, man.

261
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:35,702
I’m sorry.

262
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:42,445
It’s not who I am anymore.

263
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:14,840
Gunny, it’s me!

264
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:16,875
Don’t kill me!

265
00:20:17,546 --> 00:20:19,382
I got steaks!

266
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:22,485
If you’d shot
a foot to the left,
I’d be dead.

267
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:25,421
If I wanted you dead,
you’d be dead.

268
00:20:28,656 --> 00:20:30,152
You know, for me,

269
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,330
there’s no separation
between day and night.

270
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:34,331
So, I got to make my own.

271
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:37,192
It’s hard livin’
in a gray world.

272
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,601
I couldn’t save your eyes.

273
00:20:40,602 --> 00:20:42,197
Sorry.

274
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,507
That eats at me.

275
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:46,938
No.

276
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,544
You saved my life.

277
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:50,204
Joyce would be burying tags
in the back yard

278
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:52,415
if you hadn’t come along,
scooped me up and ran.

279
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,082
What’s her name?

280
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:01,524
Jenny.

281
00:21:01,854 --> 00:21:03,394
Jenny. All right.

282
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:05,362
She a good kid?

283
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:07,123
She’s a great kid.

284
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,435
Now, you do this,
you better lock in.

285
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:14,503
You better go full on,
no half-measures.

286
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:18,475
But you do, God help ’em.

287
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:21,104
I told Jenny I had her back.

288
00:21:22,138 --> 00:21:23,744
Well, uh...

289
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,384
I miss ya.

290
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,177
I worry about ya,

291
00:21:29,178 --> 00:21:33,490
but you didn’t have
to come down here
and pretend that

292
00:21:33,622 --> 00:21:35,491
you needed my permission
for something

293
00:21:35,492 --> 00:21:37,361
you already
made your mind up about.

294
00:21:39,496 --> 00:21:41,993
Get in here.
We’re eating.

295
00:21:55,512 --> 00:21:56,578
Hey, Carla.

296
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:58,009
Thanks for coming.

297
00:21:59,516 --> 00:22:00,847
Where is he?

298
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:03,278
Upstairs.
First door on your left.

299
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:29,380
"Moonlight Sonata".

300
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,712
- Yeah.
- It’s beautiful.

301
00:22:31,713 --> 00:22:34,011
She turned down
a music scholarship

302
00:22:34,012 --> 00:22:35,684
to go to business school.

303
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,456
She wanted to be like her pops.

304
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:43,153
Be a big land developer.

305
00:22:44,187 --> 00:22:45,496
And she will.

306
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:47,124
Yeah.

307
00:22:49,962 --> 00:22:52,371
Nah. No, thanks.

308
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:57,474
Your family needs hope.

309
00:22:57,475 --> 00:22:59,708
But I can’t face ’em like this.

310
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:03,646
When my wife passed,

311
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:06,880
and I left the Royal Marines,

312
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:09,586
a lot of people
would’ve given up on me.

313
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:12,820
But you were patient with me.

314
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:17,660
- You, Carla, Jenny.
- Jenny.

315
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:21,895
You’re my family.

316
00:23:38,648 --> 00:23:40,276
Look at me, brother.

317
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:44,379
I’m gonna bring her home.

318
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,428
I promise.

319
00:23:50,154 --> 00:23:51,727
I’m gonna bring her home.

320
00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:19,986
"Skip’s Bar."

321
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:44,813
Thank you very much.
Good, bro?

322
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,752
You good? Yeah?

323
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:52,787
How you doing?

324
00:24:52,788 --> 00:24:57,353
You need a little aperitif,
you know?

325
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,322
All right.

326
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,701
Oh, yo. Wrong house, kid.

327
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:18,867
Get the fuck out.

328
00:27:18,868 --> 00:27:20,265
Hello, Johnny.

329
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:22,167
Wanna have a race?
See who wins?

330
00:27:26,502 --> 00:27:28,338
Hands up. Stand up.

331
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:30,846
Place your fingers
behind your head.

332
00:27:30,847 --> 00:27:31,814
You a cop?

333
00:27:31,815 --> 00:27:33,211
You wish I was a cop.

334
00:27:36,017 --> 00:27:37,513
Your adventure, kid.

335
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:50,328
Where’s the girl?

336
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,966
What girl?

337
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:53,430
The missing girl.

338
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:58,874
The one your friends snatched
outta the back of the bar.

339
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:02,009
I told the cops. She ran off.
Drunk or somethin’.

340
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,112
Fuckin’ poobutt
can’t hold her drink.

341
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:07,015
How’s that my problem?

342
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,853
- People lie.

343
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:12,349
Do you lie, Johnny?

344
00:28:14,022 --> 00:28:15,551
I don’t trust people.

345
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:17,520
I trust biology.

346
00:28:18,092 --> 00:28:21,491
- We’re all wired the same.

347
00:28:22,866 --> 00:28:24,329
Get the fuck up.

348
00:28:37,815 --> 00:28:40,411
Fuck you.

349
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,579
Your mind
knows you’re in the bathtub

350
00:28:44,085 --> 00:28:45,514
and it’s just a wet towel.

351
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,616
But adrenaline
makes your heart race,

352
00:28:48,617 --> 00:28:50,189
- so you burn more air.

353
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:53,291
Your nervous system tells you
that you’re drowning.

354
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:56,063
Your bosses know you deal dope
over the bar top?

355
00:28:56,064 --> 00:28:57,625
Steal from the till?

356
00:28:57,626 --> 00:28:58,902
Fuck you!

357
00:29:15,347 --> 00:29:17,381
You know these guys
are next level.

358
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:21,056
They wipe out
entire fucking bloodlines.

359
00:29:21,287 --> 00:29:22,650
Fair enough.

360
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:24,895
Just know
you’re giving me names.

361
00:29:25,225 --> 00:29:26,589
Your choice how.

362
00:29:27,524 --> 00:29:29,031
Johnny?

363
00:29:30,263 --> 00:29:32,034
Where are you, brother?

364
00:29:33,904 --> 00:29:34,970
You’re expecting company?

365
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:38,304
Damn fuckin’ right, I am.

366
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:42,814
Open the door.
Fuckin’ kill you.

367
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:05,067
Russians.

368
00:30:06,563 --> 00:30:07,806
Fuck.

369
00:30:32,523 --> 00:30:34,360
I’m sorry, Mom.

370
00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:37,869
I’m sorry for...

371
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:42,698
shielding myself...

372
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,372
in a blanket
of accomplishments.

373
00:30:47,571 --> 00:30:49,848
<i>I wish you could’ve seen me...</i>

374
00:30:50,442 --> 00:30:52,279
<i>who I really am.</i>

375
00:30:53,379 --> 00:30:55,711
<i>Just want to be strong
like you.</i>

376
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:31,152
What am I doing here?

377
00:31:31,153 --> 00:31:33,319
on speaker <i>It’s better
you see for yourself, boss.</i>

378
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,783
<i>It’s not a big problem.</i>

379
00:31:35,784 --> 00:31:39,392
What the fuck
have you two done, huh?

380
00:31:46,828 --> 00:31:48,665
Why’d they shoot each other?

381
00:31:49,138 --> 00:31:51,239
This is very unprofessional.

382
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:53,570
Johnny has no control.
He’s a weak man.

383
00:31:53,571 --> 00:31:56,606
Maybe he talk crazy,
and then it’s bang-bang time.

384
00:31:56,607 --> 00:31:58,674
- "Bang-bang time"?
- Yeah.

385
00:31:58,675 --> 00:32:00,743
Bang-bang time.

386
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,581
You notice anything different?

387
00:32:04,582 --> 00:32:05,516
Your hair.

388
00:32:05,517 --> 00:32:07,518
- Idiot.

389
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,289
Where is my fucking money?

390
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:11,424
You think this was a robbery?

391
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:12,457
Impossible.

392
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:15,361
No one would rob us.
No one is that stupid,

393
00:32:15,362 --> 00:32:16,527
or that crazy.

394
00:32:16,528 --> 00:32:18,364
This is a shotgun wound.

395
00:32:18,365 --> 00:32:19,497
You see any shotguns?

396
00:32:19,498 --> 00:32:21,973
- Hmm?
- That’s nine bands missing.

397
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:25,569
Ninety thousand dollars
of our fucking money!

398
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,209
It’s Symon’s money.

399
00:32:28,045 --> 00:32:31,983
May your blood
purify the soil, comrade.

400
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,683
- Hey, sweetheart.

401
00:33:13,684 --> 00:33:15,718
<i>Hey, Daddy,
what are you doing?</i>

402
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:18,623
Uh, nothin’. Just, uh...

403
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,624
Just some work.

404
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:23,033
- Are you in school?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

405
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:26,069
You supposed to be
calling me from school?

406
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,533
<i>No.</i>

407
00:33:28,831 --> 00:33:29,303
Everything okay?

408
00:33:29,304 --> 00:33:32,934
<i>Yeah, I just wanted
to say, "hi." Love you, Daddy.</i>

409
00:33:33,308 --> 00:33:34,440
Love you, too.

410
00:33:34,441 --> 00:33:35,937
<i>Bye.</i>

411
00:33:41,778 --> 00:33:43,945
The fucking door opens itself?

412
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:01,428
Everything is fucked!

413
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:49,476
I don’t like this.

414
00:35:49,477 --> 00:35:52,348
I’m alone in the bed
all night.

415
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:54,009
You eat.

416
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:56,946
You come to bed for a bit.

417
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,267
You think the money
falls from the sky?

418
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:14,502
- Hmm?

419
00:36:18,473 --> 00:36:20,211
Bastard.

420
00:37:04,453 --> 00:37:05,750
Hope you don’t mind.

421
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:10,558
I was hungry.

422
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:15,431
Thought we could
have a little chat.

423
00:37:16,465 --> 00:37:18,335
I’m gonna take the tape off.

424
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:23,505
But if you can’t
control your volume...

425
00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:30,347
You go in the water.

426
00:37:32,448 --> 00:37:34,208
Do you know who I am?

427
00:37:34,648 --> 00:37:35,516
Should I?

428
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:38,618
You clearly have no idea
who you fuck with.

429
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:42,117
Make yourself happy.
Tell me.

430
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,726
You have heard of us?

431
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:48,122
I have.

432
00:37:48,123 --> 00:37:49,332
Really?

433
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,730
The Vor.

434
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,369
The Bratva. The Brothers.

435
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,800
The League of Thieves.

436
00:37:55,471 --> 00:37:56,306
Whatever Russian gangsters

437
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,639
like to call themselves
these days.

438
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:01,037
You clearly are somebody.

439
00:38:01,477 --> 00:38:03,742
You slaughter Vory soldiers.

440
00:38:03,743 --> 00:38:05,579
You steal Vory money.

441
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,284
It was a misunderstanding.

442
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,452
I am a brother of high rank.

443
00:38:09,716 --> 00:38:12,817
You and all connected
with you,

444
00:38:12,818 --> 00:38:15,325
will be hunted
for three generations.

445
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,724
Yep. I assumed so.

446
00:38:19,693 --> 00:38:22,058
We all know
how these things play out

447
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:23,564
if you don’t keep them tidy.

448
00:38:23,565 --> 00:38:25,259
- Fuck you!

449
00:38:26,865 --> 00:38:28,932
That’s for slapping
that woman this morning.

450
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:31,066
That woman was my wife.

451
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,807
That’s for slapping your wife.

452
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,277
Here’s your money.

453
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,115
I’m not a thief.

454
00:38:48,623 --> 00:38:50,690
I don’t care
about your business.

455
00:38:50,691 --> 00:38:52,924
I’m lookin’ for a young lady.

456
00:38:58,468 --> 00:39:00,227
I... I don’t understand.

457
00:39:00,228 --> 00:39:03,341
The bar you do
your dirty business out of,

458
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:06,509
a 19 year-old girl
was kidnapped.

459
00:39:08,005 --> 00:39:09,412
I’m lookin’ for her.

460
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:10,645
Dimi.

461
00:39:23,185 --> 00:39:25,286
Maybe you should
keep your voice down.

462
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:28,497
What do you want?

463
00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:29,762
Gimme the girl,

464
00:39:29,763 --> 00:39:32,535
and everybody
goes about their business.

465
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,295
A girl?

466
00:39:34,669 --> 00:39:37,199
All of this is for a girl?

467
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:42,303
No one kills three people
to sell a woman.

468
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,206
No one.

469
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:50,652
I’m not selling her.

470
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,248
I’m gonna bring her home.

471
00:39:54,887 --> 00:39:56,889
Not stopping until I do.

472
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:00,254
Who are you?

473
00:40:01,729 --> 00:40:03,258
What are you?

474
00:40:04,798 --> 00:40:06,063
Fuck you.

475
00:40:06,965 --> 00:40:08,230
Fuck you.

476
00:40:09,605 --> 00:40:10,902
Fuck you!

477
00:40:10,903 --> 00:40:12,475
Okay, we’re done.

478
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:52,747
Dimi.

479
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:56,113
Who are you, Dimi?

480
00:41:23,811 --> 00:41:25,406
Father.

481
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:34,085
He takes money.

482
00:41:34,448 --> 00:41:36,284
He leaves money.

483
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,419
He kills without fear.

484
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:40,861
The question is why?

485
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:49,507
Wolo was
a respected man of honor,

486
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:53,973
but his son was never like us.

487
00:41:58,813 --> 00:42:00,550
Dimi is not a businessman.

488
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:04,984
He prefers mischief
over hard work.

489
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:10,990
He spits on his father’s heart
every fucking day.

490
00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:15,290
Find this man.

491
00:42:20,362 --> 00:42:21,538
And bring him to me.

492
00:42:38,512 --> 00:42:40,591
My name is Jenny Garcia.

493
00:42:40,756 --> 00:42:42,350
My father is Joe.

494
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,857
My mother is Carla.

495
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:46,828
You have the wrong girl.
This is a mistake.

496
00:42:47,323 --> 00:42:50,832
They’re not real.

497
00:42:52,966 --> 00:42:54,836
You’re not real.

498
00:42:55,672 --> 00:42:57,168
This...

499
00:42:58,004 --> 00:42:59,906
is fucking real.

500
00:43:01,678 --> 00:43:03,272
Eat your fuckin’ food,

501
00:43:03,273 --> 00:43:05,010
then you put on
the fucking clothes

502
00:43:05,011 --> 00:43:07,211
- and shut the fuck up!
- Fuck you!

503
00:43:08,476 --> 00:43:12,182
Have you ever seen
someone die before?

504
00:43:12,183 --> 00:43:13,382
Huh?

505
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:20,125
Their eyes
just cloud right over.

506
00:43:20,862 --> 00:43:25,801
Mmm.
You’re so fuckin’ pretty. Huh?

507
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,529
Aren’t you, Princess?

508
00:43:29,563 --> 00:43:30,773
Aw.

509
00:43:36,977 --> 00:43:38,209
Boop.

510
00:43:42,279 --> 00:43:44,413
Eat your fuckin’ food!

511
00:43:53,488 --> 00:43:55,731
<i>Believe the idea the</i>

512
00:43:55,732 --> 00:43:57,029
<i>White Sox are in serious talks</i>

513
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:00,494
<i>to build a new stadium
in the South Loops, The 78,</i>

514
00:44:00,495 --> 00:44:03,706
<i>the location by
the Chicago River
just off Roosevelt.</i>

515
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:07,138
<i>I love the idea
of being in serious talks</i>

516
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:09,647
<i>for a new stadium
in the South Loop.</i>

517
00:44:18,854 --> 00:44:20,954
How’s it goin’, cat?
Getting rich contracting?

518
00:44:20,955 --> 00:44:24,419
Oh, yeah.
Pouring concrete more like.

519
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,664
I’m outta the game.
I’m an honest taxpayer now.

520
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,898
<i>You talked
to Gunny? How’s he doing?</i>

521
00:44:30,899 --> 00:44:33,593
<i>Saw him the other day.
He’s happy.</i>

522
00:44:33,594 --> 00:44:36,464
Well, you never call me unless
you need something,

523
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:37,630
so, what do you want?

524
00:44:37,631 --> 00:44:39,566
Lookin’ for someone
called Dimi.

525
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:43,911
<i>Probably Dimitri.
An associate of</i>
Wolodymyr Kolisnyk.

526
00:44:43,912 --> 00:44:46,376
<i>That’s a high-ranking
dude, cat.</i>

527
00:44:46,607 --> 00:44:47,948
Mafia captain.

528
00:44:47,949 --> 00:44:50,314
Legit Bratva shot caller.

529
00:44:51,051 --> 00:44:53,184
Not a guy you wanna fuck with.

530
00:44:53,185 --> 00:44:54,449
<i>Nah, never.</i>

531
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:55,725
This Dimi fella,

532
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,386
he might be involved
in human trafficking.

533
00:44:57,387 --> 00:45:01,654
<i>Can you check NADDIS and NCIC?
See if you can get a hit?</i>

534
00:45:01,655 --> 00:45:02,325
I gotta be careful,

535
00:45:02,326 --> 00:45:04,624
<i>but there’s a bar
called Hattie’s in Joliet,</i>

536
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:06,703
<i>where they sell meth
for the Russians.</i>

537
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,430
Maybe you should
get a beer there.

538
00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:10,466
<i>Nice one. Thanks.</i>

539
00:45:41,596 --> 00:45:43,135
Hey. Whatcha havin’?

540
00:45:43,136 --> 00:45:46,172
I’ll just have a beer.
You pick.

541
00:45:46,601 --> 00:45:47,205
Okay.

542
00:46:08,425 --> 00:46:11,230
Oh, hey, stranger.
Where you been?

543
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,694
Tryin’ to make a buck.

544
00:46:13,903 --> 00:46:15,399
You know,

545
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:18,731
rumor has it
you and your shitbag brother

546
00:46:18,732 --> 00:46:19,974
have been talkin’
to the Russians.

547
00:46:19,975 --> 00:46:21,437
Rumor has it you were so high,

548
00:46:21,438 --> 00:46:23,472
you accidentally killed
Big Mike in a trap house

549
00:46:23,473 --> 00:46:25,342
and blamed it
on a robbery crew.

550
00:46:25,343 --> 00:46:26,409
Fuckin’ shut up. Fuckin’...

551
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,983
Dutch finds out
anybody’s talkin’
to the Russians but him,

552
00:46:28,984 --> 00:46:31,216
he’s gonna lose
his fuckin’ mind.

553
00:46:31,217 --> 00:46:32,283
Shh!

554
00:46:37,993 --> 00:46:39,555
Do you know this guy?

555
00:46:39,962 --> 00:46:41,556
No. I’ve never seen him.

556
00:46:41,557 --> 00:46:43,097
I don’t like him.

557
00:46:43,229 --> 00:46:44,758
Looks like a cop.

558
00:46:46,628 --> 00:46:49,169
He’s got
a gun in his pocket.

559
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,170
Like a .38. You see it?

560
00:46:51,171 --> 00:46:52,402
Fuck. Yes.

561
00:46:52,403 --> 00:46:53,733
You’re up, kid.

562
00:47:26,536 --> 00:47:27,845
Follow me.

563
00:47:50,494 --> 00:47:51,968
Go talk to the man.

564
00:47:58,073 --> 00:47:59,073
You lookin’ for somethin’?

565
00:47:59,074 --> 00:48:02,539
My interests are strictly
pharmaceutical, brother.

566
00:48:03,705 --> 00:48:06,312
Any reason
why you packin’ heat, brah?

567
00:48:08,215 --> 00:48:09,512
I’m carrying money.

568
00:48:09,513 --> 00:48:12,549
Hate to lose it
to a man with a knife.

569
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:19,490
He’s a cop.

570
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:23,197
Are you a cop?

571
00:48:23,395 --> 00:48:25,528
Nah. Are you?

572
00:48:29,269 --> 00:48:31,106
Run your pockets, Chief.

573
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:33,174
Let’s check for that badge.

574
00:48:33,273 --> 00:48:34,911
You heard the man.

575
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,606
Put it on the table.

576
00:48:37,046 --> 00:48:38,508
Fuckin’ now.

577
00:48:38,509 --> 00:48:41,380
I didn’t come here
to be disrespected.

578
00:48:59,596 --> 00:49:00,894
All right.

579
00:49:04,106 --> 00:49:05,404
Let’s play.

580
00:49:06,306 --> 00:49:07,538
Get him.

581
00:49:35,368 --> 00:49:36,765
Get him, brother.

582
00:50:05,629 --> 00:50:07,004
Bye, asshole.

583
00:50:07,763 --> 00:50:08,730
Enough!

584
00:50:20,677 --> 00:50:24,318
My grandpa told me to
never shake hands sittin’.

585
00:50:26,914 --> 00:50:28,519
Look at those bricks.

586
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,062
You ain’t a cop,
you’re a working man.

587
00:50:32,557 --> 00:50:34,657
Been in construction
my whole life.

588
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:36,032
Were you a soldier?

589
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,759
’Cause you fight
like a soldier.

590
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,167
I did my part.

591
00:50:39,168 --> 00:50:40,631
I was Airborne.

592
00:50:40,763 --> 00:50:42,236
They trained us
to jump outta planes

593
00:50:42,237 --> 00:50:43,930
and we ended up
ridin’ a bus into combat.

594
00:50:43,931 --> 00:50:46,504
Sounds about right.

595
00:50:46,505 --> 00:50:48,001
Have a seat, brother.

596
00:50:52,445 --> 00:50:54,149
I heard you’re
in a buyin’ mood.

597
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,317
I’m lookin’ for blue glass,

598
00:50:56,416 --> 00:50:57,845
the good stuff.

599
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:00,189
I need weight. Regular.

600
00:51:00,453 --> 00:51:02,223
Like four pounds a month.

601
00:51:02,224 --> 00:51:03,522
That’s all?

602
00:51:03,786 --> 00:51:05,017
Who you flippin’ it to?

603
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:06,987
It goes where it’s needed.

604
00:51:07,493 --> 00:51:10,265
The customers
are my concern, not yours.

605
00:51:10,595 --> 00:51:13,300
And why here? Why us?

606
00:51:13,301 --> 00:51:16,172
My Chicago connect
is missin’ in action.

607
00:51:16,502 --> 00:51:19,835
I’m runnin’ work crews
in shifts 24/7.

608
00:51:20,308 --> 00:51:21,705
Time is money.

609
00:51:23,311 --> 00:51:25,708
Seven K for half a pound.

610
00:51:25,709 --> 00:51:27,612
That’s a Chicago price.

611
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:29,845
Five.

612
00:51:32,188 --> 00:51:33,584
There’s a pancake house

613
00:51:33,585 --> 00:51:36,753
at the highway junction
straight north of here.

614
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:40,460
Be there, 7:00 a.m.,
having breakfast.

615
00:51:40,757 --> 00:51:42,099
And?

616
00:51:42,396 --> 00:51:44,101
And bring five stacks.

617
00:51:45,432 --> 00:51:46,895
Good talk.

618
00:51:46,994 --> 00:51:48,930
Now get the fuck outta here.

619
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:15,660
Have a seat.

620
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,097
Mm.

621
00:52:25,098 --> 00:52:29,146
This is like an awkward
Tinder date.

622
00:52:29,806 --> 00:52:31,610
Just give her the money.

623
00:52:44,524 --> 00:52:47,263
Mmm. Lo, and behold.

624
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,662
People talk,

625
00:52:51,465 --> 00:52:53,797
money fucks.

626
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:05,577
You got somethin’ for me?

627
00:53:05,578 --> 00:53:08,283
We don’t know
who the fuck you are, brother.

628
00:53:08,284 --> 00:53:11,221
You’ll get a call tellin’ you
where your shit is.

629
00:53:15,555 --> 00:53:16,853
That’s it?

630
00:53:18,525 --> 00:53:20,329
Yeah. Uh-huh.

631
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:30,834
Don’t play me.

632
00:53:32,033 --> 00:53:33,572
I know where to find you.

633
00:53:33,573 --> 00:53:36,807
Yeah. I guess you do.

634
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:39,678
Thank you for not shooting me.

635
00:53:44,144 --> 00:53:46,321
fuckin’ asshole.

636
00:53:53,428 --> 00:53:55,495
- Yeah?
- <i>All right. You ready?</i>

637
00:53:55,496 --> 00:53:58,564
I’m gonna tell you where
the skante’s at, big dog.

638
00:53:58,565 --> 00:53:59,863
<i>I’m waitin’.</i>

639
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,700
Under your seat.

640
00:54:12,843 --> 00:54:15,075
- Thank you.
- <i>Keep the burner phone.</i>

641
00:54:15,076 --> 00:54:15,812
I’mma hit you tomorrow.

642
00:54:15,813 --> 00:54:17,517
Then you can tell me
how y’all motherfuckers

643
00:54:17,518 --> 00:54:19,717
built Rome
in a day off my shit.

644
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:21,786
Then we can talk about weight.

645
00:54:54,247 --> 00:54:57,294
Guess who’s gonna be
princess for a night?

646
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:07,336
You are Dimi’s
miracle workers. Huh?

647
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:10,835
And that,
that is for Dimi’s miracle.

648
00:55:14,575 --> 00:55:14,937
Why her?

649
00:55:14,938 --> 00:55:19,811
She reminded me of a painting
in one of my father’s houses.

650
00:55:21,241 --> 00:55:22,748
Take her in the back.

651
00:55:23,914 --> 00:55:25,146
Sure.

652
00:56:04,493 --> 00:56:06,659
Look how cute these ones are.

653
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,859
They look like little sharks.

654
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,796
Just like you, cutie.

655
00:56:15,867 --> 00:56:17,406
She bit me!

656
00:56:19,475 --> 00:56:22,609
She’s supposed to be asleep!

657
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:23,940
I’m so sorry, sir.

658
00:56:23,941 --> 00:56:25,139
I want her out!

659
00:56:54,004 --> 00:56:54,773
Yeah?

660
00:56:54,774 --> 00:56:56,775
Did they like my shit?

661
00:56:56,776 --> 00:56:58,844
<i>Let’s just say
they were pleased.</i>

662
00:56:59,339 --> 00:57:01,549
There’s plenty more
where that came from,

663
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:03,375
but there’s someone
you gotta check in with

664
00:57:03,376 --> 00:57:05,048
if we’re gonna do business.

665
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,719
What does that mean?

666
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,984
Precautionary measures, brah.

667
00:57:07,985 --> 00:57:11,988
Seein’ as the Feds
are handin’ out
life sentences per pound.

668
00:57:11,989 --> 00:57:14,221
Yeah, this game’s not
for everyone.

669
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,026
I hear you, big dog.

670
00:57:16,191 --> 00:57:19,029
I’mma shoot you
an invite for a sit-down.

671
00:57:19,128 --> 00:57:21,866
Bring your money
and wear a suit.

672
00:57:21,867 --> 00:57:23,362
I don’t have a suit.

673
00:57:23,363 --> 00:57:24,638
Shit. You will tomorrow.

674
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:28,302
’Cause these motherfuckers
are as high power as it gets.

675
00:57:35,881 --> 00:57:38,246
I’m here
to see someone called Dutch.

676
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:39,918
He’s right this way.

677
00:57:49,598 --> 00:57:50,995
He’s over there.

678
00:58:02,842 --> 00:58:04,910
- How you doin’?
- Hey, Dutch.

679
00:58:12,687 --> 00:58:14,248
You bring the money?

680
00:58:14,249 --> 00:58:15,657
May I?

681
00:58:21,597 --> 00:58:25,425
First, you gotta turn
your phone off.

682
00:58:31,398 --> 00:58:32,398
Now what?

683
00:58:32,399 --> 00:58:33,905
You already have my money.

684
00:58:33,906 --> 00:58:37,140
I came here in good faith
to do business.

685
00:58:44,785 --> 00:58:46,281
My name is Dimi.

686
00:58:49,086 --> 00:58:50,527
Yours?

687
00:58:51,418 --> 00:58:52,661
Bill.

688
00:58:52,892 --> 00:58:53,958
Bill Coates.

689
00:58:53,959 --> 00:58:57,457
Do you have driver’s license,
Bill Coates?

690
00:59:10,272 --> 00:59:11,173
Excuse me?

691
00:59:11,174 --> 00:59:14,045
It’s fine. Let him check.

692
00:59:17,015 --> 00:59:18,819
You drive rental.

693
00:59:20,117 --> 00:59:21,481
We check plates.

694
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,726
Tax write-off.

695
00:59:26,387 --> 00:59:27,894
That okay?

696
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,230
This man
is my business partner.

697
00:59:35,264 --> 00:59:37,101
He is small potatoes.

698
00:59:37,431 --> 00:59:40,676
I am the big potatoes.

699
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:44,372
Tell me.

700
00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:47,177
Will you be a problem?

701
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,588
Is this how you do business?

702
00:59:52,116 --> 00:59:54,690
You invite me here
to be threatened?

703
01:00:00,553 --> 01:00:02,093
Checks out.

704
01:00:04,997 --> 01:00:09,298
I apologize
for that, "William."

705
01:00:15,007 --> 01:00:17,075
You are clearly a...

706
01:00:18,373 --> 01:00:19,880
serious person.

707
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,894
If you need resupply,
use the burner.

708
01:00:34,895 --> 01:00:36,831
Text bunny rabbit emoji.

709
01:00:38,932 --> 01:00:40,526
Bunny rabbit emoji.

710
01:00:40,527 --> 01:00:43,904
You made aware
I need four pounds a month?

711
01:00:44,531 --> 01:00:45,564
Oh.

712
01:00:45,565 --> 01:00:48,909
Then text eggplant emoji.

713
01:00:53,276 --> 01:00:55,146
We are aware.

714
01:00:56,576 --> 01:00:58,853
If you like
what is in the case,

715
01:00:59,018 --> 01:01:00,657
we do more business.

716
01:01:01,086 --> 01:01:03,759
Now, you leave
and don’t look back.

717
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:06,619
Fine by me.

718
01:01:52,401 --> 01:01:55,536
Johnny, you’re
a real piece of shit.

719
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:33,244
You sneaky motherfucker.

720
01:02:41,857 --> 01:02:43,419
Hi, asshole.

721
01:02:46,994 --> 01:02:48,765
Hmm.

722
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:56,729
He’s here.

723
01:02:58,907 --> 01:03:01,700
- Oh, shit.
- on speakers
<i>He’s in a black Dodge Ram</i>

724
01:03:01,701 --> 01:03:02,734
<i>hiding in the trees.</i>

725
01:03:02,735 --> 01:03:05,408
<i>Okay,
we’re pulling up now.</i>

726
01:03:07,641 --> 01:03:08,443
Let’s go!

727
01:03:23,393 --> 01:03:26,098
Fuck! He just fuckin’ left
on a bike! Go!

728
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,301
Go! Go! Go!

729
01:03:33,172 --> 01:03:34,734
Fuck!

730
01:05:03,262 --> 01:05:04,725
Show me your hands.

731
01:05:07,299 --> 01:05:08,365
Hey.

732
01:05:08,366 --> 01:05:09,795
You didn’t see us here.

733
01:05:09,796 --> 01:05:11,500
Nothing fucking happened.

734
01:05:11,501 --> 01:05:13,568
We’ll take it
from here.

735
01:05:13,569 --> 01:05:15,538
You’re on the payroll too?

736
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,561
How do you know Dimi?

737
01:05:39,232 --> 01:05:42,136
What is your business
with Dimi?

738
01:05:43,236 --> 01:05:44,863
Ah, you two assholes.

739
01:05:44,864 --> 01:05:45,974
That man you drowned,

740
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:49,407
in his own pool
while his wife was at Pilates,

741
01:05:50,342 --> 01:05:52,046
that man was our uncle.

742
01:05:52,047 --> 01:05:53,477
He wouldn’t shut up.

743
01:05:54,115 --> 01:05:54,741
I warned him.

744
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:57,183
- Do you know who we are, hmm?
- Hey. Hey.

745
01:05:57,184 --> 01:05:59,647
Yeah, people
whose ma dresses ’em funny.

746
01:05:59,648 --> 01:06:02,057
This is fucking couture, man.

747
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,422
It’s our fucking brand!

748
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:06,655
Tie up his legs.

749
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:15,829
If you want me to be scared,
you gotta try harder.

750
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:34,518
- Whoa!

751
01:06:56,441 --> 01:06:58,871
Kill this demon.

752
01:08:33,571 --> 01:08:35,474
That is Vanko.

753
01:08:39,511 --> 01:08:41,249
And that is Danya.

754
01:08:46,683 --> 01:08:48,387
These are my sons.

755
01:08:48,388 --> 01:08:51,721
My house and my lineage end

756
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:56,462
on these cold, steel tables.

757
01:09:03,271 --> 01:09:05,471
Convene the war counsel.

758
01:09:22,983 --> 01:09:24,589
Excuse me, dear.

759
01:09:24,985 --> 01:09:26,294
Fuck off.

760
01:09:40,473 --> 01:09:41,341
Oh, wow.

761
01:09:41,342 --> 01:09:43,476
Absolutely fuckin’ not.

762
01:09:50,582 --> 01:09:52,188
Oh, fuck.

763
01:09:52,716 --> 01:09:55,191
You’re lucky
you’re not already dead.

764
01:09:55,554 --> 01:09:57,819
Dimi, apologies, okay?

765
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:59,260
I’m sorry.
I’m truly fuckin’ sorry.

766
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,229
She fucking bit
half his face off.

767
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:05,431
- It wasn’t exactly
half his face. But...
- Oh.

768
01:10:05,432 --> 01:10:07,158
Thirty-six stitches.

769
01:10:07,159 --> 01:10:08,203
That’s a lot.

770
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,404
To reattach his cheek.

771
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,738
I am in the business
of pleasure, not surgery.

772
01:10:16,905 --> 01:10:18,313
Tell me...

773
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:24,450
Fuck.

774
01:10:24,451 --> 01:10:27,453
Do you know
what business means?

775
01:10:27,454 --> 01:10:29,917
Do I... No.
I mean, yeah. Fuck.

776
01:10:29,918 --> 01:10:32,051
Business means

777
01:10:32,052 --> 01:10:33,085
you keep your word.

778
01:10:33,086 --> 01:10:36,925
You deliver promises.
You make customer happy.

779
01:10:37,332 --> 01:10:41,193
Not bite fucking face off!

780
01:10:41,798 --> 01:10:43,403
- Understood.
- No.

781
01:10:43,404 --> 01:10:46,869
You just fucked me
out of 200 grand.

782
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:50,279
If you make one, I make two.

783
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:57,846
Customer wants her dead.
I want her dead.

784
01:10:57,847 --> 01:10:59,650
You kill her.
You know where to take her.

785
01:10:59,651 --> 01:11:00,882
Consider it done.

786
01:11:00,883 --> 01:11:02,015
Now fuck off!

787
01:11:02,016 --> 01:11:03,424
Fucking off, sir.

788
01:11:04,821 --> 01:11:05,623
Holy shit, he was pissed.

789
01:11:05,624 --> 01:11:08,219
Fucking beyond.
He was this close
to smokin’ us both.

790
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:09,055
We gotta whack that girl.

791
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:11,960
Fine by me.
Let’s do the little bitch.

792
01:11:15,799 --> 01:11:18,131
We are facing a devil.

793
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:23,279
This devil kills two soldiers.

794
01:11:23,642 --> 01:11:25,577
He drowns Wolodymyr,

795
01:11:25,578 --> 01:11:27,448
an esteemed captain.

796
01:11:27,646 --> 01:11:30,318
Now he kills my sons.

797
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:33,619
You do understand my concern?

798
01:11:34,686 --> 01:11:35,984
Where is Dimi?

799
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:39,152
Won’t he know
who this devil is?

800
01:11:39,724 --> 01:11:40,757
Dimi’s hiding.

801
01:11:50,196 --> 01:11:52,308
They will help you find Dimi.

802
01:11:52,704 --> 01:11:56,103
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

803
01:11:57,170 --> 01:11:58,578
Now go.

804
01:13:02,301 --> 01:13:05,007
- Some champagne?

805
01:13:20,055 --> 01:13:22,189
Your father is dead.

806
01:13:24,092 --> 01:13:25,598
Tied to a chair

807
01:13:25,599 --> 01:13:27,897
and drowned in his pool.

808
01:13:27,898 --> 01:13:30,032
So, it’s good news.

809
01:13:30,362 --> 01:13:32,132
The man who killed him

810
01:13:32,133 --> 01:13:34,102
murdered my sons.

811
01:13:37,369 --> 01:13:39,008
Danya and Vanko?

812
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:41,846
What the fuck?

813
01:13:43,045 --> 01:13:44,848
You did not know this?

814
01:13:44,849 --> 01:13:48,754
How the fuck would I know?
Nobody tells me anything.

815
01:13:49,117 --> 01:13:52,626
The Brotherhood treats me
like I’m radioactive.

816
01:13:58,962 --> 01:14:00,160
Who is this man?

817
01:14:06,134 --> 01:14:08,070
I ask with kindness.

818
01:14:13,548 --> 01:14:15,978
I bankroll biker gang
with meth connection.

819
01:14:15,979 --> 01:14:18,948
They introduce me to buyer
with real cash.

820
01:14:18,949 --> 01:14:20,983
We met for five minutes.

821
01:14:20,984 --> 01:14:22,282
That’s it.

822
01:14:23,118 --> 01:14:26,055
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

823
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:28,629
I have this.

824
01:14:32,391 --> 01:14:34,767
He’s hunting you.

825
01:14:58,857 --> 01:15:00,287
Found him.

826
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:08,328
Oh.

827
01:15:34,387 --> 01:15:36,729
- Hello?
- <i>Hi. Mr. Cade?</i>

828
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:38,456
<i>This is the Main Office.</i>

829
01:15:38,457 --> 01:15:42,230
<i>Um, no one’s come to pick up
Meredith today.</i>

830
01:15:42,362 --> 01:15:43,737
I’ll be right there.

831
01:15:56,882 --> 01:15:58,685
- Hey.
- Good day?

832
01:15:58,686 --> 01:16:00,688
- Yeah.
- Let’s go.

833
01:16:04,923 --> 01:16:06,990
Where’s Grandpa?
He’s never late.

834
01:16:06,991 --> 01:16:08,629
He’s not answering me.

835
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:10,928
I sent him, like, 20 messages.

836
01:16:10,929 --> 01:16:12,392
I’m sure he’s fine.

837
01:16:13,294 --> 01:16:15,395
You didn’t kill him, did you?

838
01:16:16,429 --> 01:16:18,002
Dad, I’m kidding.

839
01:16:22,908 --> 01:16:24,271
Do you trust me?

840
01:16:24,272 --> 01:16:25,779
Yeah.

841
01:16:25,977 --> 01:16:27,208
So, if I tell you something,

842
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:28,473
you know
you can believe me, right?

843
01:16:28,474 --> 01:16:31,851
Okay, the build-up
is just making it worse.

844
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,786
I made a big mistake.

845
01:16:33,787 --> 01:16:35,656
Oh, my God.
You did kill Grandpa.

846
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:36,888
Merry, I’m serious.

847
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:38,120
Some really bad people
are after me,

848
01:16:38,121 --> 01:16:40,959
and I don’t want anyone
I love to get hurt.

849
01:16:41,289 --> 01:16:44,126
Are you sharing your location
with Grandpa?

850
01:16:44,127 --> 01:16:45,359
Yeah.

851
01:16:45,491 --> 01:16:47,261
Can you see his location?

852
01:16:47,262 --> 01:16:49,099
Maybe, I don’t know.

853
01:16:52,135 --> 01:16:53,642
Daddy, he’s at home.

854
01:17:13,959 --> 01:17:16,830
Merry, stay here, okay?

855
01:17:19,558 --> 01:17:21,064
Merry! Stay there!

856
01:17:21,065 --> 01:17:22,967
Daddy, be careful!

857
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:07,815
Who were they?

858
01:18:08,343 --> 01:18:09,883
Russian mafia?

859
01:18:10,851 --> 01:18:12,446
Yes.

860
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:16,054
They were looking for you.

861
01:18:16,989 --> 01:18:20,696
This happened because of you.

862
01:18:21,356 --> 01:18:24,997
Violence follows you
like a cloud.

863
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,933
He could’ve left you
in there, Grandpa.

864
01:18:27,934 --> 01:18:30,068
He saved your life.

865
01:18:32,202 --> 01:18:33,973
I can acknowledge that.

866
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,637
You should go to the hospital.

867
01:18:39,341 --> 01:18:40,914
You’ll be safe there.

868
01:18:41,145 --> 01:18:41,980
I’ll take care of Merry.

869
01:18:41,981 --> 01:18:45,677
It’s time
o let the cops
handle this.

870
01:18:46,381 --> 01:18:48,218
Cops can’t stop them.

871
01:18:50,187 --> 01:18:51,418
All right.

872
01:18:51,419 --> 01:18:53,355
We’ll figure it out later.

873
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:55,588
And, Levon,

874
01:18:56,259 --> 01:18:57,094
thank you.

875
01:19:13,111 --> 01:19:14,177
You remember Gunny?

876
01:19:14,178 --> 01:19:17,049
Your blind friend
who doesn’t know he’s blind?

877
01:19:17,148 --> 01:19:18,412
That’s the one.

878
01:19:18,413 --> 01:19:19,644
He has a country house.

879
01:19:19,645 --> 01:19:22,681
We’ll be safe there
till the storm passes.

880
01:19:35,331 --> 01:19:36,530
Hi.

881
01:19:37,135 --> 01:19:39,070
You wanna come inside?
Come on.

882
01:19:39,071 --> 01:19:41,006
- You hungry?
- Always.

883
01:19:41,007 --> 01:19:42,943
- And you?
- Yeah.

884
01:19:43,273 --> 01:19:44,405
What happened, man?

885
01:19:44,406 --> 01:19:46,781
You fuck with
the wrong people, huh?

886
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:47,639
Hey, you could’ve stopped me.

887
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:51,116
What force on earth
is gonna stop you?

888
01:19:52,183 --> 01:19:53,954
It’s gettin’ ugly.

889
01:19:54,218 --> 01:19:58,023
Can you find this girl?
Can you really find this girl?

890
01:19:58,024 --> 01:19:59,454
I can find her.

891
01:19:59,685 --> 01:20:01,489
I’m gonna bring her home.

892
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:03,964
I hear that. You got a plan?

893
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:08,936
I’m gonna ask this Dimi fella
where she is.

894
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:12,202
All roads lead to him.

895
01:20:12,203 --> 01:20:13,808
Now, you killed
your way into this,

896
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:16,570
you’re gonna have to kill
your way out of it.

897
01:20:16,911 --> 01:20:18,341
I figured as much.

898
01:20:18,473 --> 01:20:20,848
I can help you with that.

899
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:21,948
Oh, yeah?

900
01:20:21,949 --> 01:20:23,984
Let me show you somethin’.

901
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:31,288
After you, sir.

902
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:35,258
All right, I will be
your weapons sommelier

903
01:20:35,259 --> 01:20:36,831
for this evening.

904
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:37,898
If you come around this wall,

905
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:39,999
you see
the Avtomat Kalashnikov,

906
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,496
been killing Americans
since 1947.

907
01:20:42,497 --> 01:20:46,467
Also, comes in a deluxe,
blingy version pulled direct

908
01:20:46,468 --> 01:20:47,732
from Saddam’s palace.

909
01:20:47,733 --> 01:20:49,910
What you got over here
is the M-Four Carbine,

910
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:53,144
it’s the Chevy Impala
of the war on terror.

911
01:20:53,145 --> 01:20:56,147
Beautiful MP5 SD here
if you wanna kill somebody,

912
01:20:56,148 --> 01:20:58,611
but you don’t wanna
wake ’em up.

913
01:20:58,612 --> 01:21:01,053
But this is
the real beast here.

914
01:21:01,054 --> 01:21:02,219
One of the original weapons of

915
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:04,387
the four horsemen
of the apocalypse.

916
01:21:06,257 --> 01:21:07,555
The M14.

917
01:21:09,491 --> 01:21:11,228
You might remember this weapon.

918
01:21:11,229 --> 01:21:13,462
I don’t want to, but I do.

919
01:21:14,001 --> 01:21:15,497
There you go.

920
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:26,177
I’ll have to drill out
the serial numbers.

921
01:21:26,178 --> 01:21:27,916
Oh, no, that’s already done.

922
01:21:28,477 --> 01:21:31,546
These were never here.
Never anywhere.

923
01:21:32,481 --> 01:21:33,889
Kinda like us,

924
01:21:34,714 --> 01:21:35,252
back in the day.

925
01:21:35,253 --> 01:21:38,355
We did some
righteous shit, brother.

926
01:21:40,522 --> 01:21:41,930
Yeah, we did.

927
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,498
- What’s in there?
- None of your business.

928
01:21:51,731 --> 01:21:53,040
Can I come?

929
01:21:53,535 --> 01:21:55,074
Absolutely not.

930
01:21:55,075 --> 01:21:56,603
What about school?

931
01:21:56,604 --> 01:21:59,706
You’ll miss
a couple of days, at most.

932
01:22:06,317 --> 01:22:07,515
I barely see you.

933
01:22:07,516 --> 01:22:09,517
I don’t want you
getting in trouble.

934
01:22:09,518 --> 01:22:10,650
Then I’ll never see you.

935
01:22:10,651 --> 01:22:12,686
That’s not gonna happen.

936
01:22:13,423 --> 01:22:16,558
See this? This is you.

937
01:22:17,196 --> 01:22:18,560
Half and half.

938
01:22:20,166 --> 01:22:21,794
I want you to hold onto this.

939
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:24,533
I’m comin’ back for that.

940
01:22:26,337 --> 01:22:27,139
Okay.

941
01:22:30,407 --> 01:22:31,671
I love you.

942
01:22:31,672 --> 01:22:32,870
Love you, Daddy.

943
01:22:36,578 --> 01:22:38,613
Daddy, I don’t want you
getting hurt.

944
01:22:38,877 --> 01:22:41,550
I’ll be back soon, okay?

945
01:22:41,814 --> 01:22:43,452
Gunny, take good care of her.

946
01:22:43,453 --> 01:22:44,651
Yeah, of course.

947
01:22:44,652 --> 01:22:45,784
- Thank you, Joyce.
- This way.

948
01:22:45,785 --> 01:22:47,787
- Bye, Levon.
- All right, sweetheart.

949
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,088
"Our Father,

950
01:23:14,748 --> 01:23:16,255
who art in heaven,

951
01:23:16,486 --> 01:23:18,158
hallowed be thy name,

952
01:23:19,192 --> 01:23:20,589
thy kingdom come,

953
01:23:20,853 --> 01:23:22,294
thy will be done."

954
01:23:22,459 --> 01:23:24,196
God ain’t here, sweetheart.

955
01:23:24,197 --> 01:23:27,035
- Have a nice nap, Princess?

956
01:23:27,266 --> 01:23:28,728
We gotta pull over
and load this bitch

957
01:23:28,729 --> 01:23:30,268
with some
fuckin’ sleeping pills...

958
01:23:30,269 --> 01:23:31,632
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

959
01:23:31,633 --> 01:23:33,403
- Fucking bitch!
- Hey, take it easy!

960
01:23:33,404 --> 01:23:35,141
- Pull over!
- Come on! Stop!

961
01:23:35,142 --> 01:23:36,340
Fucking get it, fucking bitch.

962
01:23:36,341 --> 01:23:37,275
Fucking grab that bitch!

963
01:23:37,276 --> 01:23:40,014
Pull over!
Pull over! Pull over!

964
01:23:46,384 --> 01:23:49,155
God damn it!
Where’s my fucking gun!

965
01:23:49,156 --> 01:23:50,783
- Fuck!

966
01:23:53,358 --> 01:23:55,294
- Fuck.

967
01:24:04,303 --> 01:24:06,536
Fuckin’ move, Viper!

968
01:24:38,601 --> 01:24:41,505
Fuck! Fuck!

969
01:24:45,707 --> 01:24:48,006
I mean, what the fuck?

970
01:24:48,413 --> 01:24:49,942
She is fast.

971
01:24:50,184 --> 01:24:52,548
We’re going back
to fuckin’ prison!

972
01:24:52,549 --> 01:24:54,011
Huh?

973
01:24:54,012 --> 01:24:55,551
Huh? You get it?

974
01:24:55,552 --> 01:24:57,884
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

975
01:24:59,050 --> 01:25:00,457
Fuck! Okay, okay.

976
01:25:00,458 --> 01:25:02,889
Fuck! Fuck!

977
01:25:05,496 --> 01:25:06,794
Shit.

978
01:25:20,544 --> 01:25:21,941
Okay, genius,

979
01:25:22,975 --> 01:25:24,284
now what?

980
01:25:44,568 --> 01:25:45,998
Are you all right?

981
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:50,276
My name is Jenny Garcia.
I was kidnapped.

982
01:25:50,277 --> 01:25:52,410
It’s all right.
We know who you are.

983
01:25:52,411 --> 01:25:53,841
Let’s get you home.

984
01:25:54,842 --> 01:25:56,151
Okay.

985
01:26:21,869 --> 01:26:23,640
I’m so fucking sorry.

986
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:30,845
Miss me?

987
01:26:31,516 --> 01:26:32,946
Fuck!

988
01:26:36,081 --> 01:26:38,325
Fucking dome the bitch!

989
01:26:41,328 --> 01:26:43,692
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Is that him?

990
01:26:43,693 --> 01:26:45,563
What the fuck?

991
01:26:45,959 --> 01:26:46,860
Fuck, it’s a video call.

992
01:26:46,861 --> 01:26:48,862
Here, take the fucking phone!
Give me the...

993
01:26:48,863 --> 01:26:51,998
- Fuck!
- ...God damn fucking gun.

994
01:26:52,405 --> 01:26:53,031
Hey, sir.

995
01:26:53,032 --> 01:26:55,341
<i>Dimi says you still
have the girl.</i>

996
01:26:55,342 --> 01:26:57,872
Uh, yeah, yeah.
We still got her.

997
01:26:58,444 --> 01:27:00,347
<i>Show me she’s still alive.</i>

998
01:27:06,078 --> 01:27:07,717
See? Still alive.

999
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:12,754
<i>I want a second date tonight,
at the farmhouse.</i>

1000
01:27:12,755 --> 01:27:14,294
<i>One million dollars.</i>

1001
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:16,054
Uh, yeah.
Whatever you want, sir.

1002
01:27:16,055 --> 01:27:18,562
I’ll get her cleaned up
and smelling
real pretty for you.

1003
01:27:18,563 --> 01:27:21,566
<i>No, no, no. I want her dirty.</i>

1004
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:23,194
<i>Not sleepy,</i>

1005
01:27:23,601 --> 01:27:26,274
<i>but dirty and alive.</i>

1006
01:27:26,802 --> 01:27:29,002
<i>- For now.
-</i>

1007
01:27:29,904 --> 01:27:33,478
- Fuck, yeah.
- Oh, yes.

1008
01:27:33,479 --> 01:27:34,776
Which passport, okay?

1009
01:27:34,777 --> 01:27:36,646
You sent me
all these passports.

1010
01:27:36,647 --> 01:27:38,978
I can’t tell.
Red? Blue? Green?

1011
01:27:39,650 --> 01:27:41,915
- I don’t know
what color, just tell me.
- Where are we going?

1012
01:27:41,916 --> 01:27:44,753
What? Okay. Yeah. Go.

1013
01:27:44,754 --> 01:27:46,458
I take all of them, okay?

1014
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:49,692
- What do you want?
You want money?
- No, I don’t...

1015
01:27:49,693 --> 01:27:50,858
Here, take your money.
You take money.

1016
01:27:50,859 --> 01:27:51,991
I don’t want
your fucking money!

1017
01:27:51,992 --> 01:27:53,025
- You take all the money.
- I don’t want

1018
01:27:53,026 --> 01:27:54,598
- your fucking money!
- You take all the money, okay?

1019
01:27:54,599 --> 01:27:58,031
- Let me help you!
- No, no, I don’t need help.

1020
01:27:59,802 --> 01:28:00,802
Fuck.

1021
01:28:00,803 --> 01:28:02,607
Get away! Stop!

1022
01:28:02,706 --> 01:28:04,311
Starting tomorrow, rehab.

1023
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:08,711
All you do is let me slip down
slippery slope.

1024
01:28:10,648 --> 01:28:12,143
You’re supposed
to be my rock.

1025
01:28:12,144 --> 01:28:13,881
You know, like they say,
"Oh, she’s my rock."

1026
01:28:13,882 --> 01:28:16,081
"Hey, thank you."
I have nothing
to thank you for.

1027
01:28:23,595 --> 01:28:26,828
Something’s going on out there.

1028
01:28:26,829 --> 01:28:29,831
You know
what? You are just an enabler.

1029
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:36,739
- he’s here!

1030
01:29:06,539 --> 01:29:07,539
Okay.

1031
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:09,838
Okay. You made your point.

1032
01:29:09,839 --> 01:29:11,268
Now we make
a deal, and you begin

1033
01:29:11,269 --> 01:29:13,237
a new life as
a wealthy man, huh?

1034
01:29:13,238 --> 01:29:15,548
I can pay my own bills.

1035
01:29:16,076 --> 01:29:17,241
Congrats.

1036
01:29:17,242 --> 01:29:19,749
- Come closer and she dies.
- No!

1037
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:21,312
I figured that.

1038
01:29:24,051 --> 01:29:26,921
You should disappear.
Take the money.

1039
01:29:28,286 --> 01:29:29,727
Make a nice life.

1040
01:29:42,806 --> 01:29:44,137
Where is she?

1041
01:29:48,207 --> 01:29:50,143
I do not know this woman.

1042
01:29:50,946 --> 01:29:52,717
You’re a bad liar.

1043
01:29:53,047 --> 01:29:55,082
Why risk everything?

1044
01:29:57,249 --> 01:29:59,184
Why kill everyone for her?

1045
01:29:59,185 --> 01:30:01,495
’Cause I told her
I had her back.

1046
01:30:07,226 --> 01:30:09,228
If I give you this woman,

1047
01:30:10,867 --> 01:30:12,231
you let me live?

1048
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:15,168
Because if I just give you
the address,

1049
01:30:16,334 --> 01:30:17,774
then you shoot me, huh?

1050
01:30:17,775 --> 01:30:21,779
What if you give me
a fake address
and I shoot you?

1051
01:30:22,142 --> 01:30:24,243
That’s bad for both of us.

1052
01:30:30,722 --> 01:30:32,955
Head south on 57.

1053
01:30:33,087 --> 01:30:35,188
Then I give you her address.

1054
01:30:36,893 --> 01:30:38,191
Let’s go.

1055
01:30:38,994 --> 01:30:40,566
You know this guy?

1056
01:30:40,567 --> 01:30:43,437
Of course, I know. He’s Viper.

1057
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:46,000
He’s Chief of
Human Resource Department

1058
01:30:46,001 --> 01:30:49,168
and recruiting
for special projects.

1059
01:30:49,169 --> 01:30:51,941
Why you do all this
for a whore?

1060
01:30:56,616 --> 01:30:57,980
Say it again.

1061
01:30:58,211 --> 01:31:00,213
Please, say that again.

1062
01:31:02,116 --> 01:31:03,590
Thought so.

1063
01:31:03,887 --> 01:31:05,218
Okay, Dimi,

1064
01:31:05,383 --> 01:31:07,220
tell me where we’re going.

1065
01:31:08,089 --> 01:31:09,596
Where is she?

1066
01:31:11,763 --> 01:31:13,391
There.

1067
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:36,920
She’s in there?

1068
01:31:37,217 --> 01:31:38,591
She’s there.

1069
01:31:38,592 --> 01:31:41,155
- Promise?

1070
01:31:41,353 --> 01:31:42,794
I promise.

1071
01:31:42,992 --> 01:31:44,290
She’s there.

1072
01:32:00,372 --> 01:32:01,648
Why her?

1073
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:05,179
Who decides?

1074
01:32:09,051 --> 01:32:10,689
Viper goes to club,

1075
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:13,087
takes pictures of pretty girls.

1076
01:32:13,088 --> 01:32:16,322
I send them to clients,
they make choice.

1077
01:32:17,158 --> 01:32:18,896
Meeting is arranged.

1078
01:32:19,666 --> 01:32:22,602
This is my specialty service.

1079
01:32:22,603 --> 01:32:25,540
Like shopping for
a set of snow tires.

1080
01:32:29,467 --> 01:32:31,403
These are human beings.

1081
01:32:32,503 --> 01:32:35,109
You must be kidding.

1082
01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:36,880
You think money gives a shit

1083
01:32:36,881 --> 01:32:38,553
where it comes from?

1084
01:32:39,917 --> 01:32:41,049
If I didn’t do this,

1085
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:42,821
somebody else would.

1086
01:32:43,514 --> 01:32:45,758
You still haven’t told me why.

1087
01:32:46,726 --> 01:32:48,563
Why do you hunt us?

1088
01:32:48,761 --> 01:32:50,422
You have a daughter?

1089
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:52,489
No.

1090
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:54,734
Then you won’t understand.

1091
01:34:34,493 --> 01:34:36,033
Hey, good lookin’ out.

1092
01:34:36,737 --> 01:34:39,201
Hey, yo, we good, brother?

1093
01:34:39,938 --> 01:34:41,675
Man, we far from good.

1094
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,776
That motherfucker
we hooked up with Dimi

1095
01:34:43,777 --> 01:34:46,207
clapped out half
a dozen Russians tonight.

1096
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:49,684
Rumor is, he’s on his way to
Dimi’s trap house right now.

1097
01:34:52,819 --> 01:34:53,786
Everybody,

1098
01:34:53,787 --> 01:34:55,249
mount the fuck up!

1099
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:57,020
You heard the man.
Mount up!

1100
01:35:55,816 --> 01:35:57,510
That’s funny shit.

1101
01:36:14,263 --> 01:36:16,969
Sounds lovely, Princess.

1102
01:36:30,741 --> 01:36:33,150
I don’t condone this behavior,

1103
01:36:33,381 --> 01:36:34,953
but my bank account does.

1104
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:39,287
Hey. It’s time.

1105
01:36:39,288 --> 01:36:41,256
What the fuck
are we still doing here?
Come on.

1106
01:36:41,257 --> 01:36:42,995
Yeah. I’ll get the pervert.

1107
01:36:43,996 --> 01:36:46,525
We’re all just numbers, kid.
Nothin’ personal.

1108
01:36:46,526 --> 01:36:49,496
Feels pretty fuckin’
personal to me.

1109
01:37:05,248 --> 01:37:07,381
We have to go now, sir.

1110
01:37:07,382 --> 01:37:08,581
Why?

1111
01:37:09,153 --> 01:37:10,649
It’s now or never.

1112
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:12,750
Then it’s now.

1113
01:37:46,124 --> 01:37:48,192
What have I done to you?

1114
01:37:49,721 --> 01:37:50,963
Nothing.

1115
01:37:50,964 --> 01:37:52,658
That’s the best part.

1116
01:37:58,499 --> 01:38:02,040
I wonder
what you look like on...

1117
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:03,702
the inside.

1118
01:38:18,992 --> 01:38:20,784
- The fuck was that?

1119
01:38:20,785 --> 01:38:22,556
- whoa.

1120
01:38:48,483 --> 01:38:49,715
Levon!

1121
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:51,848
Are they fucking shooting?

1122
01:38:51,849 --> 01:38:54,456
Who’s gonna
get fucked now, huh?

1123
01:39:11,605 --> 01:39:13,045
He’s in there.

1124
01:39:13,046 --> 01:39:15,081
Shooting the place up.

1125
01:39:17,347 --> 01:39:18,909
Everybody,

1126
01:39:19,052 --> 01:39:19,953
lock and load.

1127
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:22,186
Let’s go get this motherfucker.

1128
01:39:22,187 --> 01:39:23,550
Yeah, you two on me.

1129
01:39:23,551 --> 01:39:25,057
You heard the man. Come on.

1130
01:39:25,058 --> 01:39:26,850
Stay tight, stay right.

1131
01:39:26,851 --> 01:39:29,688
Demon, put it through
the glass.

1132
01:39:29,689 --> 01:39:30,964
You got it.

1133
01:40:04,031 --> 01:40:04,657
Levon!

1134
01:40:04,658 --> 01:40:07,264
- Shut the fuck up!

1135
01:40:07,265 --> 01:40:09,168
Hey. It’s gonna be okay.

1136
01:40:10,367 --> 01:40:11,632
Yeah?

1137
01:40:12,468 --> 01:40:14,007
You just... Yeah.

1138
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:14,931
I’m beginning to think

1139
01:40:14,932 --> 01:40:17,604
that you do not know
what you are doing!

1140
01:40:17,605 --> 01:40:18,737
Don’t worry, sir.

1141
01:40:18,738 --> 01:40:20,277
Everything’s under control.

1142
01:40:20,278 --> 01:40:21,179
I promise you.

1143
01:40:30,222 --> 01:40:32,058
I’m gonna cut your heart out.

1144
01:40:32,059 --> 01:40:33,357
Good luck.

1145
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:06,521
What the fuck
is your real name?

1146
01:41:06,522 --> 01:41:07,984
Levon.

1147
01:41:07,985 --> 01:41:09,822
Nice to meet you, Levon.

1148
01:41:10,427 --> 01:41:11,592
You ready, son?

1149
01:41:11,593 --> 01:41:12,758
I’m always ready.

1150
01:41:20,173 --> 01:41:21,668
My fight wasn’t with you.

1151
01:41:21,669 --> 01:41:23,341
I know, brother.

1152
01:41:23,935 --> 01:41:25,244
Finish it.

1153
01:41:46,859 --> 01:41:48,267
Sorry, brother.

1154
01:42:06,879 --> 01:42:09,618
- Levon!
- What the fuck?

1155
01:42:16,559 --> 01:42:18,627
How dare you come in here?

1156
01:42:20,024 --> 01:42:21,926
- Fuck! Shit!
- Oh, fuck!

1157
01:42:21,927 --> 01:42:23,797
Oh, that is not good.

1158
01:42:26,338 --> 01:42:29,341
- What the fuck?

1159
01:42:29,671 --> 01:42:30,506
- Hang on.
- Reload!

1160
01:42:30,507 --> 01:42:32,475
- wait, wait, wait.

1161
01:42:32,476 --> 01:42:33,036
No, no, no!

1162
01:42:33,037 --> 01:42:34,873
- I can explain everything!
- Fuck!

1163
01:42:34,874 --> 01:42:36,150
No!

1164
01:42:48,393 --> 01:42:49,526
Oh, shit.

1165
01:42:55,433 --> 01:42:56,961
Mommy!

1166
01:42:56,962 --> 01:42:59,062
- Fuck!

1167
01:42:59,063 --> 01:43:00,404
Fuck!

1168
01:43:00,405 --> 01:43:01,637
Fuckin’ bitch!

1169
01:43:02,033 --> 01:43:03,276
Fuck.

1170
01:43:03,738 --> 01:43:05,212
Fuck you!

1171
01:43:12,076 --> 01:43:13,847
It’s over now.

1172
01:43:16,652 --> 01:43:18,653
Fucking die, bitch!

1173
01:43:49,751 --> 01:43:51,357
I think I killed her.

1174
01:43:52,853 --> 01:43:54,085
Good.

1175
01:44:01,433 --> 01:44:02,499
Fuck.

1176
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:03,666
Whoa.

1177
01:44:04,337 --> 01:44:05,832
Stay on my six.

1178
01:44:05,833 --> 01:44:07,274
What’s that mean?

1179
01:44:07,604 --> 01:44:09,001
Follow me.

1180
01:44:20,881 --> 01:44:23,080
There’s an active shooter
in there.

1181
01:44:45,037 --> 01:44:47,105
- Shit.

1182
01:44:53,650 --> 01:44:54,980
Let’s kill this guy.

1183
01:45:12,262 --> 01:45:13,471
What was that?

1184
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:14,770
Bluetooth.

1185
01:45:17,344 --> 01:45:19,070
- Is that a grenade?

1186
01:45:19,071 --> 01:45:20,611
Mind your ears.

1187
01:45:28,850 --> 01:45:29,916
Oh.

1188
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:35,218
You ready?

1189
01:45:35,219 --> 01:45:36,527
No.

1190
01:45:36,528 --> 01:45:37,859
Time to go.

1191
01:45:50,542 --> 01:45:52,379
See you on the other side.

1192
01:45:56,075 --> 01:45:56,976
What was that?

1193
01:45:56,977 --> 01:45:58,979
Respect for an old friend.

1194
01:46:26,138 --> 01:46:26,808
You ready to go home?

1195
01:46:26,809 --> 01:46:29,581
- Get me the hell outta here.

1196
01:46:51,229 --> 01:46:52,669
Yes, my brother.

1197
01:46:52,670 --> 01:46:54,265
He escaped...

1198
01:46:54,969 --> 01:46:56,266
with the girl.

1199
01:46:56,267 --> 01:46:58,236
<i>None of this was business.</i>

1200
01:46:58,775 --> 01:47:01,547
The devil has what he came for.

1201
01:47:03,010 --> 01:47:04,341
Let him go.

1202
01:47:04,517 --> 01:47:08,850
I understand our need
to move quietly in the world.

1203
01:47:08,851 --> 01:47:11,820
<i>But I will not turn
the other cheek</i>

1204
01:47:11,821 --> 01:47:15,923
to the man
who killed my children.

1205
01:47:15,924 --> 01:47:18,222
Then we will kill you.

1206
01:47:18,223 --> 01:47:22,469
The Brotherhood comes before
your personal vengeance.

1207
01:47:23,503 --> 01:47:25,064
Do you understand?

1208
01:47:25,065 --> 01:47:26,362
I understand.

1209
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:44,920
Hey...

1210
01:47:46,152 --> 01:47:48,462
snitches get stitches.

1211
01:48:04,775 --> 01:48:07,073
<i>¡Mija!</i> Oh, my God.

1212
01:48:12,651 --> 01:48:16,589
- I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
- No. No.

1213
01:48:17,381 --> 01:48:18,789
No. No.

1214
01:48:22,353 --> 01:48:23,629
Levon!

1215
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,933
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1216
01:48:43,275 --> 01:48:44,583
I was thinking
about taking Merry

1217
01:48:44,584 --> 01:48:46,013
out to the chicken coop today.

1218
01:48:46,014 --> 01:48:46,684
Oh.

1219
01:48:46,685 --> 01:48:48,114
- Yeah, would you like that?
- Yeah.

1220
01:48:48,115 --> 01:48:48,917
- Yeah.
- I don’t know.

1221
01:48:48,918 --> 01:48:50,820
You better watch out
for that old grumpy one.

1222
01:48:50,821 --> 01:48:52,855
- He’s mean. He’s mean.

1223
01:48:52,856 --> 01:48:55,386
- Oh, no. He’s mean.

1224
01:48:57,531 --> 01:48:59,829
Hey, Dad, it’s you!
You came back.

1225
01:49:02,767 --> 01:49:04,164
Told you I would.

1226
01:49:08,201 --> 01:49:09,575
You’re okay, Daddy?

1227
01:49:09,576 --> 01:49:11,677
Yeah. I nicked myself shaving.

1228
01:49:16,209 --> 01:49:17,011
Hi.

1229
01:49:17,012 --> 01:49:18,243
Welcome back.

1230
01:49:20,983 --> 01:49:22,182
Hey, Joyce.

1231
01:49:23,315 --> 01:49:24,855
You’re in one piece.

1232
01:49:25,988 --> 01:49:27,319
Just about.

1233
01:49:29,024 --> 01:49:31,223
Well, I guess
they didn’t kill you, huh?

1234
01:49:31,224 --> 01:49:34,226
Nah. They really tried
their best.

1235
01:49:34,227 --> 01:49:35,899
Oh.

1236
01:49:37,263 --> 01:49:38,935
You found that girl?

1237
01:49:39,331 --> 01:49:40,937
I found her.

1238
01:49:46,778 --> 01:49:47,613
So, what did I miss?

1239
01:49:47,614 --> 01:49:51,045
Well, I made friends
with a crow and an owl.

1240
01:49:51,046 --> 01:49:53,685
And there’s a goat
I taught to say my name.

1241
01:49:53,686 --> 01:49:55,885
- No.
- Yeah.

1242
01:49:55,886 --> 01:49:57,656
It was really cool.
I was just talking,

1243
01:49:57,657 --> 01:49:59,284
and then it was like, "Merry!

1244
01:49:59,285 --> 01:50:01,055
"Merry!"

1245
01:50:16,401 --> 01:50:18,139
Welcome back, brother.

1246
01:50:18,777 --> 01:50:19,678
You’re home.
