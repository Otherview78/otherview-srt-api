3
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:17,218
Stop now.

4
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:22,219
Tell me where it is.

5
00:02:22,948 --> 00:02:25,268
You and your brethren possess
what is not rightfully yours.

6
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:28,980
You and your brethren possess
what is not rightfully yours.

7
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:33,317
I don't know what
you are talking about.

8
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:37,154
Is it a secret you will die for?

9
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:39,865
- Please.
- As you wish.

10
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:40,366
Wait!

11
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:49,041
My God, forgive me.

12
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:51,335
In the sacristy...

13
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:54,880
the Church of Saint-Sulpice,
is the Rose Line.

14
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:59,760
Beneath the Rose.

15
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:04,761
Thank you.

16
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:37,006
Thank you.

17
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:42,007
Thank you.

18
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:54,269
Symbols are a language that
can help us understand our past.

19
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:59,278
As the saying goes,
a picture says a thousand words...

20
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:03,115
but which words?

21
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:06,827
Interpret for me, please, this symbol.
First thing that comes to mind.

22
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:09,330
- Hatred, racism.
- Ku Klux Klan.

23
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:14,331
Yes, yes, interesting. But they would
disagree with you in Spain.

24
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,589
There, they are robes
worn by priests.

25
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,966
Now this symbol. Anyone?

26
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:23,260
Evil.

27
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:24,595
In English, please.

28
00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:25,846
Devil's pitchfork.

29
00:04:25,847 --> 00:04:28,474
Poor, poor Poseidon.

30
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:31,852
That is his trident. A symbol of power
to millions of the ancients.

31
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:33,938
That is his trident. A symbol of power
to millions of the ancients.

32
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:36,148
Now this symbol.

33
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,818
- Madonna and child.
- Faith. Christianity.

34
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,780
No. No, it's the pagan god
Horus and his mother, lsis...

35
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:45,533
centuries before
the birth of Christ.

36
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:49,453
Understanding our past
determines actively...

37
00:04:49,454 --> 00:04:52,832
our ability to understand
the present.

38
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:57,628
So how do we sift truth from belief?

39
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:01,340
How do we write our own histories,
personally or culturally...

40
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:03,634
and thereby define ourselves?

41
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:08,431
How do we penetrate years,
centuries, of historical distortion...

42
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:11,434
to find original truth?

43
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:14,854
Tonight, this will be our quest.

44
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:18,357
I still think that his whole take on phi
was a little far-fetched.

45
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:23,279
I don't think so. I think that the
golden ratio is everywhere in nature.

46
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,489
I don't think so. I think that the
golden ratio is everywhere in nature.

47
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,199
Sure, I can do that.

48
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,369
My son is a student
of yours at Harvard.

49
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,830
- Michael Culp? He adores you.
- Oh, yeah.

50
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:35,040
He says you're the best teacher
he's ever had.

51
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:39,211
Ms. Culp, I think I already gave
Michael an A-minus.

52
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:40,796
He told me. Thank you.

53
00:05:40,797 --> 00:05:42,798
Mr. Langdon?

54
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:44,467
Hi.

55
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:46,594
Bonjour, professor.

56
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:51,595
I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ.
A kind of French FBI.

57
00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:55,186
Will you take a look
at this photo, please?

58
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:58,230
My police Chief, Capitaine Fache,
had hoped...

59
00:05:58,231 --> 00:06:02,026
considering your expertise
and the markings on the body...

60
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:07,027
you might assist us.

61
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:17,204
Will you excuse me a moment?

62
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:19,335
I was supposed to have
drinks with him.

63
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:19,585
I was supposed to have
drinks with him.

64
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:22,129
Yes, we know.

65
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,424
We found your name
in his daily planner.

66
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:30,425
He never showed.
I waited for over an hour.

67
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:34,308
Why would someone do this to him?

68
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:37,770
Oh, you misunderstand, professor.

69
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:40,147
He was shot, yes.

70
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:42,942
But what you see
in the photograph...

71
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:47,943
Monsieur Saunière did to himself.

72
00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:53,657
Teacher, all four are dead.

73
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:57,081
The <i>sénéchaux</i> and the
Grand Master himself.

74
00:06:57,082 --> 00:07:00,334
<i>Then I assume
you have the location.</i>

75
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:03,629
Confirmed by all.

76
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,799
Independenüy.

77
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,800
<i>I had feared the Priory's penchant
for secrecy might prevail.</i>

78
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:19,683
The prospect of death
is strong motivation.

79
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:24,900
It is here.

80
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:28,279
In Paris, Teacher.

81
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,280
It hides beneath the Rose
in Saint-Sulpice.

82
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:36,412
<i>You will go forth, Si/as.</i>

83
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:41,413
<i>You will go forth, Si/as.</i>

84
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:54,944
I chastise my body.

85
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:36,194
Capitaine Fache is waiting for you.

86
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:42,121
Okay.

87
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:56,218
- Mr. Langdon.
- Yes.

88
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:59,179
I'm Captain Bezu Fache.

89
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,764
You like our pyramid?

90
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:02,641
It's magnificent.

91
00:10:02,642 --> 00:10:05,728
A scar on the face of Paris.

92
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:10,729
After me, please.

93
00:10:15,238 --> 00:10:17,823
It's the pairing
of those two pyramids.

94
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:19,324
It's unique.

95
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:21,660
The two are geometric echoes.

96
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:25,414
Fascinating.

97
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:27,583
I'm not sure how much help
I'm gonna be here this evening.

98
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:32,584
I'm not sure how much help
I'm gonna be here this evening.

99
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:35,716
How well did you know the curator?

100
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:39,136
Not at all. We met only once.

101
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:41,638
We were on a...

102
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,016
On a panel together.

103
00:10:44,017 --> 00:10:46,894
Something is funny?

104
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:47,603
We didn't agree on much.

105
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:48,687
We didn't agree on much.

106
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:53,688
Frankly, I was Surprised
when he contacted me.

107
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:05,325
Could we take the stairs?

108
00:11:17,258 --> 00:11:20,719
So Saunière requested
tonight's meeting.

109
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,054
Yes.

110
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:25,224
How? Did he call you?

111
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:29,520
E-mail. He heard I was in Paris.

112
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,522
Had something to discuss.

113
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:32,023
What?

114
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:42,654
You seem uncomfortable.

115
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,883
- Are any of those real?
- Of course not.

116
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:03,804
So you know something
of security procedures.

117
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:08,225
Well, I know video surveillance in
a museum this size is cost-prohibitive.

118
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:08,684
Most now rely on containment.

119
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:10,936
Most now rely on containment.

120
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:14,314
Yes, forget about
keeping the criminals out.

121
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:19,315
Now we keep them in.

122
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:26,326
The Grand Gallery.
This is where you found the body.

123
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:29,121
How would you know that?

124
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:34,122
I recognize the parquet floor
from the Polaroid. It's unmistakable.

125
00:12:43,469 --> 00:12:44,081
Dear God.

126
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:51,059
Let's cover the talking points again,
Your Eminence.

127
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,146
Many call Opus Dei
a brainwashing cult.

128
00:12:54,147 --> 00:12:57,482
Others, an ultraconservative
Christian secret society.

129
00:12:57,483 --> 00:13:00,402
- We are a simple Catholic church.
- Simple?

130
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:03,322
With a brand-new $47-million
headquarters in Manhattan.

131
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:06,617
Our followers are generous,
should we apologize for that?

132
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:09,119
Perhaps a less defensive tack,
Your Eminence.

133
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,081
The press continue
to be harsh with us.

134
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:17,419
We are not Cafeteria Catholics.

135
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,671
We don't pick and choose
which rules to follow.

136
00:13:19,672 --> 00:13:23,091
We follow doctrine. Rigorously.

137
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:27,012
Does doctrine necessarily
include vows of chastity, tithing...

138
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:30,724
and atonement for sins through
self-flagellation and the cilice?

139
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:35,103
Many of our followers are married.
Many of them have families.

140
00:13:35,104 --> 00:13:38,148
Only a small proportion
choose to live ascetically...

141
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:41,777
in the cloisters
of our residential halls.

142
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:43,779
But we are all united in God's work
around the world.

143
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,446
But we are all united in God's work
around the world.

144
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:48,784
Surely that is an admirable way
to lead one's life.

145
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:51,536
Why are some media referring
to Opus Dei as "God's mafia"?

146
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:56,537
Obviously, some people fear
what they don't understand.

147
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:59,544
And because the war finally
draws to a close.

148
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:03,757
- Bishop, we need to stay on message.
- That will be all, Michael, thank you.

149
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:06,134
Aringarosa.

150
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:10,138
<i>Si/as has succeeded.
The legend is true.</i>

151
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,349
<i>It hides beneath the Rose.</i>

152
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,894
<i>My part of our bargain
is nearly fulfilled.</i>

153
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:19,231
I meet the Council in an hour.

154
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:19,356
I will have your money tonight,
Teacher.

155
00:14:19,357 --> 00:14:23,402
I will have your money tonight,
Teacher.

156
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:26,238
<i>The Vitruvian Man.</i>

157
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:29,658
It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's
most famous Sketches.

158
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:32,035
And the star on his skin?

159
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:33,245
A pentacle.

160
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:35,080
And its meaning?

161
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:39,376
The pentacle is ancient.

162
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:42,754
Symbols carry different meanings
in different settings.

163
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:45,549
This symbol, professor.
This setting.

164
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,427
The pentacle is
a pagan religious icon.

165
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:50,178
Devil worship.

166
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:55,179
No. No, no, no.
The pentacle before that.

167
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:58,270
This is a symbol for Venus.

168
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:00,814
It represents the female half
of all things.

169
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:05,610
It's a concept called "the divine
goddess" by religious historians.

170
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:08,947
You are telling me that
Saunière's last act on earth...

171
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:13,948
was to draw a goddess symbol
on his Chest? Why?

172
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:18,915
Captain Fache,
obviously I can't tell you why.

173
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:22,711
I can tell you he, as well as anyone,
knows the meaning of this symbol...

174
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:25,630
and it has nothing to do
with worshiping the devil.

175
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:27,215
- Is that so?
- Yes.

176
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:29,801
Then...

177
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:32,012
what do you make of this?

178
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:36,475
"O, Draconian devil.
Oh, lame saint."

179
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:39,978
It's a phrase.
Doesn't mean anything, not to me.

180
00:15:39,979 --> 00:15:44,979
What would you do if you had such
limited time to send a message?

181
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:50,026
Well, I suppose
I'd try to identify my killer.

182
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:52,157
Precisely.

183
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:53,992
Precisely.

184
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:56,536
So, professor...

185
00:15:56,537 --> 00:15:58,830
Officer Neveu.

186
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:00,499
Please, pardon the interruption.

187
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,708
This is not the time.

188
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:04,002
I received the Crime-scene jpegs
at headquarters...

189
00:16:04,003 --> 00:16:06,171
and I've deciphered the code.

190
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:06,963
It's a Fibonacci Sequence.

191
00:16:06,964 --> 00:16:07,923
It's a Fibonacci Sequence.

192
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:10,675
That's the code Saunière
left on the floor.

193
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:12,969
Headquarters sent me
to explain, Captain.

194
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,429
It is the Fibonacci Sequence.

195
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,098
The numbers are out of order.

196
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:19,101
But before that, I have an urgent
message for Professor Langdon.

197
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:20,727
Right?

198
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:24,356
Pardon me?

199
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:27,609
I'm Sophie Neveu,
French police, Cryptology.

200
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:32,610
Your embassy called Division.

201
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:39,450
I'm sorry, monsieur, they said
it was a matter of life and death.

202
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:43,625
This is the number of your
embassy's messaging service.

203
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:48,626
Well, thank you.

204
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:55,387
<i>Hel/o, you've reached
the home of Sophie Neveu.</i>

205
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:58,306
Miss Neveu? This...

206
00:16:58,307 --> 00:17:00,058
No. That's the right number.

207
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:02,727
You have to dial an access code
to pick up your messages.

208
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:03,937
But I'm getting...

209
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:08,938
It's a three-digit code.
It's on the paper I gave you.

210
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:19,077
<i>Professor Langdon,
do not react to this message.</i>

211
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:22,539
<i>You must follow my directions
very closely and, above all...</i>

212
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,041
<i>reveal nothing to Captain Fache.</i>

213
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:30,042
<i>You are in grave danger.</i>

214
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:42,225
Church of Saint-Sulpice.

215
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:44,853
<i>Good evening, Sister.</i>

216
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:49,065
<i>/need you to show someone
our Church tonight.</i>

217
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:51,026
Of course, Father.

218
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:53,945
But so late?

219
00:17:53,946 --> 00:17:55,155
Wouldn't tomorrow...?

220
00:17:55,156 --> 00:18:00,156
<i>This is a request from an
important bishop of Opus Dei.</i>

221
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,620
It would be my pleasure.

222
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:30,232
There's been an accident. A friend.

223
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:32,442
I have to fly home in the morning.

224
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:33,902
I see.

225
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:38,156
Is there a restroom I could use? I just
wanna splash some water on my face.

226
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:41,451
Yes.

227
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:45,038
She said it is meaningless.

228
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,832
Mathematical joke.

229
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:52,337
Is it meaningless?

230
00:18:52,338 --> 00:18:53,672
I'll take another look
when I come back.

231
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:58,301
I'll take another look
when I come back.

232
00:18:58,302 --> 00:19:03,302
I'm sorry. Of course.

233
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:21,449
Do you have a message
from Saunière?

234
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,202
What are you talking about?

235
00:19:24,203 --> 00:19:25,870
Crazy old man.

236
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:28,665
You have me Confused with
someone else.

237
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,625
I was asked to come here
and Consult.

238
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:32,711
<i>No,</i> you <i>are
sous surveillance cachée.</i>

239
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:34,504
Yes, and...

240
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:36,298
What?

241
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:40,385
Bring the suspect to the Crime scene
and hope he incriminates himself.

242
00:19:40,386 --> 00:19:42,053
Suspect?

243
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:44,973
Check your jacket pocket.

244
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:49,974
Just look.

245
00:19:50,646 --> 00:19:52,230
GPS tracking dot.

246
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:55,483
Accurate within two feet
anywhere on the globe.

247
00:19:55,484 --> 00:20:00,484
The agent who picked you up
slipped it into yourjacket...

248
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:04,117
in case you tried to run.

249
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:09,118
We have you on a little leash,
professor.

250
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:18,506
Why would I try to run?
I didn't do anything.

251
00:20:18,507 --> 00:20:22,761
So, what do you think about
the fourth line of text...

252
00:20:22,762 --> 00:20:27,762
Fache wiped clean
before you arrived?

253
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,520
He brought you here to force a
confession, Professor Langdon.

254
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:43,444
He's still in there?
What's he doing?

255
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,579
Fache isn't even looking
for other suspects, okay?

256
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,580
He is sure you're guilty.

257
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,504
When did Saunière contact you?

258
00:20:57,505 --> 00:20:58,755
- Today?
- Yes, yes.

259
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:01,007
What time? What time?

260
00:21:01,008 --> 00:21:03,051
At 3. Around 3. Three.

261
00:21:03,052 --> 00:21:05,970
The gallery alarm was triggered at 8.
You were...

262
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:07,847
- I was giving a lecture.
- At 9.

263
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:12,811
You had the privacy light on
in your hotel room until 8:30, right?

264
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:16,731
We call Fache "the Bull."
Once he starts, he doesn't stop.

265
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:20,110
He can arrest you and detain you
for months while he builds a case.

266
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:23,655
And by then whatever Saunière
wanted you to tell me will be useless.

267
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:26,366
Stop it! Just stop!

268
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:28,076
Who are you?

269
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:31,746
What are you talking about?
Tell you what?

270
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:36,747
Maybe who really killed him.

271
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:43,383
The Fibonacci Sequence.

272
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:45,760
I believe Saunière wrote it...

273
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:50,761
so his investigation would
include cryptographers.

274
00:21:52,726 --> 00:21:54,686
That's quite a leap, isn't it?

275
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:57,397
No.

276
00:21:57,398 --> 00:21:59,232
And the letters.

277
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,525
"P.S."

278
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:05,526
P.S., postscript.

279
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:10,285
"Princess Sophie."
Yeah. Silly, I know.

280
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:15,286
But I was only a girl
when I lived with him.

281
00:22:18,711 --> 00:22:23,711
Jacques Saunière
was my grandfather.

282
00:22:26,427 --> 00:22:31,427
Apparently, it was his dying wish
that we meet.

283
00:22:31,557 --> 00:22:33,975
If you help me understand why...

284
00:22:33,976 --> 00:22:38,897
I will get you to your embassy,
where we cannot arrest you.

285
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:42,400
Fache was never gonna let me
just stroll out of here, was he?

286
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:44,569
No.

287
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:49,570
If we are to get away from here,
we must find another way.

288
00:22:59,418 --> 00:23:04,418
What exactly do you propose?

289
00:23:11,263 --> 00:23:14,474
Saunière was reading his book.

290
00:23:14,475 --> 00:23:18,353
"Blood trail."

291
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:20,355
Excuse me, Captain.

292
00:23:20,356 --> 00:23:24,609
Crypto called.
They identified the code.

293
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,611
Neveu told us already.

294
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:30,615
I should have fired her on the spot,
barging in like that.

295
00:23:30,616 --> 00:23:32,742
Yes.

296
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:37,705
Except they didn't send Neveu.

297
00:23:37,706 --> 00:23:39,040
What?

298
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:39,374
Captain, look at this.

299
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:44,128
Captain, look at this.

300
00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:45,797
He Jumped!

301
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:49,175
Shit.

302
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:52,887
<i>He's moving again. And fast.</i>

303
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:56,099
He must be in a car.

304
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,100
<i>He's going south
on Pont du Carrousel.</i>

305
00:24:08,988 --> 00:24:09,532
Bastard.

306
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:36,139
That cop will check
the whole lower floor.

307
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,518
That cop will check
the whole lower floor.

308
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:43,354
I will only take a moment.

309
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:48,355
Of course.

310
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:58,324
He is much older than I remember.

311
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:12,212
I hadn't seen or spoken to him
in a very long time.

312
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:24,725
He phoned my office today.
Several times.

313
00:25:24,897 --> 00:25:28,441
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

314
00:25:28,442 --> 00:25:33,442
I thought it was another trick
to get back in touch.

315
00:25:34,406 --> 00:25:38,493
It seems when
he couldn't Speak to me...

316
00:25:38,494 --> 00:25:43,494
he reached out to you.

317
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,463
Whatever he needed
so badly to say...

318
00:25:50,464 --> 00:25:55,464
he found neither of us in time.

319
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:22,912
- Wait a minute.
- Professor?

320
00:26:22,913 --> 00:26:24,997
Come on.

321
00:26:24,998 --> 00:26:27,583
It can't be that easy.

322
00:26:27,584 --> 00:26:32,338
This is wrong.
Yeah. See? This is wrong.

323
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:36,175
The Fibonacci numbers only
make sense when they're in order.

324
00:26:36,176 --> 00:26:37,844
These are scrambled.

325
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:41,806
If he was trying to reach out,
maybe he was doing it in code.

326
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:45,810
Would you hold this, please?

327
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:50,106
This phrase is meaningless.

328
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:54,777
Unless you assume these letters
are out of order too.

329
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:59,778
An anagram.

330
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,792
You have eidetic memory?

331
00:27:09,793 --> 00:27:14,793
Not quite. But I can pretty much
remember what I see.

332
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:38,029
Anagram is right.

333
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,823
"O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint"
becomes:

334
00:27:40,824 --> 00:27:43,659
"Leonardo da Vinci.
The <i>Mona</i> Lisa."

335
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:48,660
Professor, the <i>Mona</i> Lisa
is right over here.

336
00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:58,629
Look at this. He must have
thrown it from the window.

337
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:00,927
Smart to hit the truck.

338
00:28:00,928 --> 00:28:05,928
What, you admire him now?

339
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:08,351
We're stupid.
Who did we leave at the museum?

340
00:28:08,352 --> 00:28:11,395
Ledoux? Get him on the radio!

341
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:14,690
Her smile is in
the lower spatial frequencies.

342
00:28:14,691 --> 00:28:18,486
The horizon is significantly lower
on the left than it is on the right.

343
00:28:18,487 --> 00:28:19,737
Why?

344
00:28:19,738 --> 00:28:22,073
Well, see, she appears larger
from the left than on the right.

345
00:28:22,074 --> 00:28:23,241
Well, see, she appears larger
from the left than on the right.

346
00:28:23,242 --> 00:28:27,161
Historically, the left was female,
the right was male.

347
00:28:27,162 --> 00:28:30,248
The sacred feminine.

348
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:31,582
Why do you say that?

349
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:36,583
Something Saunière said
the first time we came here.

350
00:28:38,632 --> 00:28:43,632
There. Blood.

351
00:28:52,646 --> 00:28:55,523
Hey.

352
00:28:55,524 --> 00:28:58,943
"So dark the con of man."

353
00:28:58,944 --> 00:29:02,446
No. It doesn't say that.

354
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:07,447
Is it another anagram?
Can you break it?

355
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:13,791
Professor, hurry. Hurry!

356
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:16,919
Moon. Sermon. Charms.

357
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,132
Demons. Omens. Codes.
Monks. Ranks. Rocks.

358
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:23,009
<i>Madonna of the Rocks.</i>

359
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:23,622
Da Vinci.

360
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:39,479
Careful. Careful.

361
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:48,655
This can't be this. The fleur-de-Iis.

362
00:30:05,594 --> 00:30:09,263
Stay where you are!

363
00:30:09,264 --> 00:30:10,973
Let go of the painting...

364
00:30:10,974 --> 00:30:14,852
and put it on the ground.

365
00:30:14,853 --> 00:30:19,106
No. You put your gun down.

366
00:30:19,107 --> 00:30:21,400
Now!

367
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:25,863
Or else I will destroy the painting.

368
00:30:25,864 --> 00:30:27,531
Hurry UP!

369
00:30:27,532 --> 00:30:32,203
Slide your gun to me.

370
00:30:32,204 --> 00:30:33,871
Be careful.

371
00:30:33,872 --> 00:30:38,872
I never really liked this painting.

372
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:57,187
Run.

373
00:31:28,135 --> 00:31:30,428
It was Saunière's.

374
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:34,265
I remember finding it once
when I was a girl.

375
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:37,268
He'd promised
he'd give it to me one day.

376
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:39,687
Have you ever heard
those words before, Sophie?

377
00:31:39,688 --> 00:31:41,272
"So dark the con of man"?

378
00:31:41,273 --> 00:31:43,107
No. Have you?

379
00:31:43,108 --> 00:31:47,737
When you were a child, were you
aware of any secret gatherings?

380
00:31:47,738 --> 00:31:50,281
Anything ritualistic in nature?

381
00:31:50,282 --> 00:31:53,743
<i>Meetings your grandfather
would've wanted kept secret?</i>

382
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:57,371
Was there ever any talk of something
called the Priory of Sion?

383
00:31:57,372 --> 00:32:00,499
The what? Why are you
asking these things?

384
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,169
The Priow of Sion is a myth.

385
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:07,840
One of the world's oldest and most
secret societies, with leaders like...

386
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:10,801
Sir Isaac Newton,
da Vinci himself.

387
00:32:10,802 --> 00:32:12,803
The fleur-de-Iis is their crest.

388
00:32:12,804 --> 00:32:15,514
They're guardians of a secret
they supposedly refer to...

389
00:32:15,515 --> 00:32:18,309
as "the dark con of man."

390
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,269
But what secret?

391
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:24,899
The Priow of Sion protects
the source of God's power on earth.

392
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,900
The Priow of Sion protects
the source of God's power on earth.

393
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:36,911
I can't do this by myself.

394
00:32:36,912 --> 00:32:40,039
I'm in enough trouble as it is.
That's my embassy.

395
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,332
Please.

396
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,000
Even if we could get out of this...

397
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:43,501
Okay.

398
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:25,789
No, no, no. You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna make it!

399
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Well, that was...

400
00:33:45,355 --> 00:33:47,356
We won't last long in this car.

401
00:33:47,357 --> 00:33:50,401
Fache doesn't like to be eluded,
even on a good day.

402
00:33:50,402 --> 00:33:55,402
We need to get out of sight.

403
00:34:10,672 --> 00:34:12,882
Christ, give me strength.

404
00:34:12,883 --> 00:34:17,883
Christ, give me strength.

405
00:34:25,478 --> 00:34:30,478
You are a ghost.

406
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,860
Christ, give me strength.

407
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,040
Stealing in a house of God!

408
00:36:26,016 --> 00:36:30,477
You are an angel.

409
00:36:30,478 --> 00:36:30,602
Christ, give me strength.

410
00:36:30,603 --> 00:36:35,603
Christ, give me strength.

411
00:36:58,173 --> 00:37:01,091
You have powerful friends.

412
00:37:01,092 --> 00:37:04,803
Bishop Aringarosa
has been kind to me.

413
00:37:04,804 --> 00:37:05,179
I could not miss this Chance
to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.

414
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,683
I could not miss this Chance
to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.

415
00:37:09,684 --> 00:37:12,353
A pity you Couldn't wait for morning.

416
00:37:12,354 --> 00:37:15,189
The light is not ideal.

417
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:19,777
Tell me, Sister, please,
of the Rose Line.

418
00:37:19,778 --> 00:37:24,778
A rose line is any line that goes from
the North to South Poles.

419
00:37:25,116 --> 00:37:30,116
Set into the Streets of Paris,
135 brass markers...

420
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:32,956
mark the world's
first prime meridian...

421
00:37:32,957 --> 00:37:35,626
which passed through
this very Church.

422
00:37:35,627 --> 00:37:37,628
It hides beneath the Rose.

423
00:37:37,629 --> 00:37:40,130
I'm sorry?

424
00:37:40,131 --> 00:37:44,051
Sister.

425
00:37:44,052 --> 00:37:49,052
I do not want to keep you.
I will show myself out.

426
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:51,170
I insist.

427
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,776
May the peace of the Lord
be with you.

428
00:38:00,777 --> 00:38:05,777
And with you.

429
00:38:24,426 --> 00:38:27,803
Gray Smart Car. Black roof.

430
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:28,095
Gray Smart Car. Black roof.

431
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:31,849
Corner of Denain Boulevard
at the train station.

432
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,267
How could you let them get away?

433
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:36,395
Why not just shoot the damn painting?
Imbecile!

434
00:38:36,396 --> 00:38:39,440
You should put his cigar
out in your hand!

435
00:38:39,441 --> 00:38:42,818
Get out of here!

436
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:47,819
They found Neveu's car
abandoned at the train station.

437
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:54,075
And two tickets to Brussels paid for
with Langdon's credit card.

438
00:38:54,205 --> 00:38:55,873
A decoy, I'm sure.

439
00:38:55,874 --> 00:38:58,542
All the same,
send an Officer to the station.

440
00:38:58,543 --> 00:39:01,378
Question all the taxi drivers.
I'll put this on the wire.

441
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:04,548
Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.

442
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:08,552
I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.

443
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:13,553
Robert Langdon is guilty.

444
00:39:20,523 --> 00:39:22,357
This is the Bois de Boulogne?

445
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:27,358
We should be safe in this park
for a few minutes.

446
00:39:41,961 --> 00:39:46,961
Your police don't patrol this park.

447
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:40,269
Stay here.

448
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,187
Stay here.

449
00:40:42,188 --> 00:40:44,940
Police.

450
00:40:44,941 --> 00:40:49,941
What do you want?

451
00:41:01,082 --> 00:41:05,377
Fifty euros for all your stuff.

452
00:41:05,378 --> 00:41:10,378
Go and get something to eat.

453
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,860
Did it occur to you
that could be dangerous?

454
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:33,572
No. And now we have
a place to think.

455
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:34,114
Any ideas, professor?

456
00:41:34,115 --> 00:41:36,491
Any ideas, professor?

457
00:41:36,492 --> 00:41:41,492
You could've just handed me
a piece of a UFO from Area 51.

458
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:44,750
"What's the next step?"

459
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:46,585
With him, it's always:

460
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:50,422
"Sophie, what's the next step?"

461
00:41:50,423 --> 00:41:51,965
Puzzles.

462
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:54,259
Codes.

463
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:59,260
A treasure hunt.

464
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:04,891
To find his killer.

465
00:42:05,396 --> 00:42:09,024
Maybe there is something
about this Priory of Sion.

466
00:42:09,025 --> 00:42:09,483
I hope not.

467
00:42:09,484 --> 00:42:10,275
I hope not.

468
00:42:10,276 --> 00:42:15,276
Any Priory story ends in bloodshed.
They were butchered by the Church.

469
00:42:15,448 --> 00:42:18,825
<i>It all started over a thousand
years ago when a French king...</i>

470
00:42:18,826 --> 00:42:21,453
<i>conquered the holy city
of Jerusalem.</i>

471
00:42:21,454 --> 00:42:24,956
<i>This Crusade, one of the most
massive and sweeping in history...</i>

472
00:42:24,957 --> 00:42:28,669
was actually orchestrated
by a secret brotherhood...

473
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,253
the Priory of Sion...

474
00:42:30,254 --> 00:42:34,758
and their military arm,
the Knights Templar.

475
00:42:34,759 --> 00:42:38,011
But the Templars were created
to protect the Holy Land.

476
00:42:38,012 --> 00:42:42,474
That was a cover to hide their
true goal, according to this myth.

477
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:45,894
<i>Supposedly the Invasion
was to find an artifact...</i>

478
00:42:45,895 --> 00:42:47,938
<i>lost since the time of Christ.</i>

479
00:42:47,939 --> 00:42:52,275
<i>An art/fact, it was said,
the Church would kill to possess.</i>

480
00:42:52,276 --> 00:42:56,071
Did they find it,
this buried treasure?

481
00:42:56,072 --> 00:42:57,531
Put it this way:

482
00:42:57,532 --> 00:43:00,617
One day the Templars
simply stopped searching.

483
00:43:00,618 --> 00:43:04,287
<i>They quit the Holy Land
and traveled directly to Rome.</i>

484
00:43:04,288 --> 00:43:06,373
<i>Whether they blackmailed
the papacy...</i>

485
00:43:06,374 --> 00:43:09,000
or <i>the Church bought their Silence,
no one knows.</i>

486
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:13,588
<i>But it is a fact the papacy
declared these Priory knights...</i>

487
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:17,884
<i>these Knights Templar,
of limitless power.</i>

488
00:43:17,885 --> 00:43:21,430
<i>By the 13003, the Templars
had grown too powerful.</i>

489
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:23,181
<i>Too threatening.</i>

490
00:43:23,182 --> 00:43:24,516
<i>So the Vatican
issued secret orders...</i>

491
00:43:24,517 --> 00:43:25,475
<i>So the Vatican
issued secret orders...</i>

492
00:43:25,476 --> 00:43:29,146
to <i>be opened simultaneously
all across Europe.</i>

493
00:43:29,147 --> 00:43:33,358
<i>The Pope had declared the
Knights Templar Satan worshipers...</i>

494
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:38,113
and said God had charged him with
cleansing the earth of these heretics.

495
00:43:38,114 --> 00:43:40,741
The plan went off like Clockwork.

496
00:43:40,742 --> 00:43:43,910
<i>The Templars
were all but exterminated.</i>

497
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:48,331
<i>The date was October 13th, 1307.
A Friday.</i>

498
00:43:48,332 --> 00:43:50,500
<i>Friday the 13th.</i>

499
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:53,712
<i>The Pope sent troops
to C/aim the Priory's treasure...</i>

500
00:43:53,713 --> 00:43:54,588
<i>but they found nothing.</i>

501
00:43:54,589 --> 00:43:55,505
<i>But they found nothing.</i>

502
00:43:55,506 --> 00:43:58,967
<i>The few surviving
Knights of the Priory had vanished...</i>

503
00:43:58,968 --> 00:44:02,012
<i>and the search for their
Sacred arfifact began again.</i>

504
00:44:02,013 --> 00:44:06,349
What artifact? I've never
heard about any of this.

505
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,226
Yes, you have.

506
00:44:08,227 --> 00:44:11,146
Almost everyone on earth has.

507
00:44:11,147 --> 00:44:16,147
You just know it as the Holy Grail.

508
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:24,284
Please, Saunière thought he knew
the location of the Holy Grail?

509
00:44:24,285 --> 00:44:26,369
Maybe more than that.

510
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:30,499
This cross and the flower,
this could be very old. But look.

511
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,500
This metal here underneath is much
newer, and there's a modern ID stamp.

512
00:44:35,922 --> 00:44:39,758
"Haxo 24-."

513
00:44:39,759 --> 00:44:43,345
And these dots.
These dots are read by a laser.

514
00:44:43,346 --> 00:44:47,390
This is more than a pendant.
This is a key your grandfather left you.

515
00:44:47,391 --> 00:44:51,269
He left us, professor.

516
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:56,270
And vingt-quatre Haxo,
it's not an ID stamp.

517
00:44:56,275 --> 00:45:01,275
It's a street address.

518
00:45:03,032 --> 00:45:04,991
<i>This is Jacques Saunière.</i>

519
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:08,537
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

520
00:45:08,538 --> 00:45:11,164
Please, Monsieur Saunière,
pick up the phone.

521
00:45:11,165 --> 00:45:12,916
This is Sandrine Bieil.

522
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:15,585
I have called the list.

523
00:45:15,586 --> 00:45:18,088
I fear the other guardians are dead.

524
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:20,340
The lie has been told.

525
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:22,467
The floor panel has been broken.

526
00:45:22,468 --> 00:45:26,096
Please, monsieur, pick up the phone.
I beg you.

527
00:45:26,097 --> 00:45:29,724
Job 38, verse 11.

528
00:45:29,725 --> 00:45:33,436
Do you know it, Sister?

529
00:45:33,437 --> 00:45:36,857
Job 38:11.

530
00:45:36,858 --> 00:45:39,943
Hitherto shalt thou come...

531
00:45:39,944 --> 00:45:41,862
but no further.

532
00:45:41,863 --> 00:45:46,863
"But no further."

533
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:52,330
Do you mock me?

534
00:45:52,331 --> 00:45:55,292
Where is the keystone?

535
00:45:55,293 --> 00:45:58,086
I do not know.

536
00:45:58,087 --> 00:46:01,506
No.

537
00:46:01,507 --> 00:46:06,219
You are a sister of the Church...

538
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,806
and yet you serve them:
The Priow.

539
00:46:09,807 --> 00:46:14,807
Jesus had but one true message.
That...

540
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,667
Come, you saints of God.

541
00:46:37,668 --> 00:46:41,046
Hasten, angels of the Lord.

542
00:46:41,047 --> 00:46:44,257
To receive her soul.

543
00:46:44,258 --> 00:46:49,258
And bring her to the sight
of the Almighty.

544
00:46:52,767 --> 00:46:57,767
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

545
00:47:28,594 --> 00:47:33,594
Welcome, bishop.

546
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:35,225
May Christ be with you.

547
00:47:35,226 --> 00:47:37,185
And also with you.

548
00:47:37,186 --> 00:47:41,356
It's been too long, Manuel.

549
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:43,566
I saw your press conference.

550
00:47:43,567 --> 00:47:45,193
Very priestly.

551
00:47:45,194 --> 00:47:46,736
Vultures.

552
00:47:46,737 --> 00:47:51,737
But you need a good cover
to fly into Italy these days.

553
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:56,413
So how are things in Rome?

554
00:47:56,414 --> 00:48:00,041
We serve at his pleasure.

555
00:48:00,042 --> 00:48:02,752
Today is today.

556
00:48:02,753 --> 00:48:07,753
But there are many tomorrows.

557
00:48:08,217 --> 00:48:10,510
Vatican cellars.

558
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:12,887
1976.

559
00:48:12,888 --> 00:48:17,888
Seventy-six, a year of independence.
How fitting.

560
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:22,939
I thought you'd like it.

561
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:23,481
I'll fetch the others.

562
00:48:23,482 --> 00:48:28,482
I'll fetch the others.

563
00:48:44,754 --> 00:48:49,754
Welcome, bishop.

564
00:48:50,176 --> 00:48:55,176
This Council is convened.

565
00:49:00,728 --> 00:49:05,728
Cur words shall never
pass these walls.

566
00:49:11,155 --> 00:49:14,866
What business, say you?

567
00:49:14,867 --> 00:49:17,118
As you know, my request for funds...

568
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,581
Yes, 20 million euro
in untraceable bearer bonds.

569
00:49:21,582 --> 00:49:24,959
A tad more than petty cash.
Wouldn't you say, bishop?

570
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,421
The endeavor is complex.
Freedom has a high cost.

571
00:49:28,422 --> 00:49:30,673
And, of course, you will deliver us.

572
00:49:30,674 --> 00:49:33,301
How fortunate we are.

573
00:49:33,302 --> 00:49:38,139
I only offer a route to the renewal
of faith for all men.

574
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,808
How humble.

575
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:42,310
Our savior, Bishop Aringarosa.

576
00:49:42,311 --> 00:49:44,813
Were we to grant your request...

577
00:49:44,814 --> 00:49:48,191
when would
this mission commence?

578
00:49:48,192 --> 00:49:50,443
- Actually, tonight.
- What?

579
00:49:50,444 --> 00:49:52,320
- It has begun.
- We have not agreed.

580
00:49:52,321 --> 00:49:54,030
How dare you presume to...

581
00:49:54,031 --> 00:49:55,990
I do not presume, I act!

582
00:49:55,991 --> 00:49:58,368
The Vatican's unwillingness
to support us...

583
00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:00,161
is both impious and cowardly.

584
00:50:00,162 --> 00:50:04,916
Blood is being spilled because true
Christian Values lie in ruins. No more!

585
00:50:04,917 --> 00:50:09,917
This council has forgotten
its very purpose.

586
00:50:10,881 --> 00:50:13,049
Tonight...

587
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:15,677
the Grail will be destroyed.

588
00:50:15,678 --> 00:50:20,678
The Prion/s few remaining members
will be silenced.

589
00:50:27,565 --> 00:50:32,152
I was contacted by a man
who calls himself only "the Teacher."

590
00:50:32,153 --> 00:50:35,989
He knows a great deal
about this Council.

591
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:40,990
And about the Priory.

592
00:50:53,757 --> 00:50:56,050
<i>Two prostitutes identified
Langdon and Neveu...</i>

593
00:50:56,051 --> 00:50:56,467
<i>Two prostitutes identified
Langdon and Neveu...</i>

594
00:50:56,468 --> 00:51:01,468
<i>getting into a taxi
in the Bois de Bou/ogne.</i>

595
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,446
Because of your expertise?

596
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:18,114
- I'm sorry?
- About the Priow.

597
00:51:18,115 --> 00:51:21,159
Do you think that's why
Saunière sought you out?

598
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,454
I can think of dozens of scholars
who know a lot more about it.

599
00:51:24,455 --> 00:51:26,039
Actually, I didn't think
he liked me very much.

600
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,209
Actually, I didn't think
he liked me very much.

601
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:32,837
Cnce made a joke at my expense.
Got a big laugh out of it.

602
00:51:32,838 --> 00:51:37,838
What was it?

603
00:51:47,436 --> 00:51:52,436
How may I help you?

604
00:51:55,110 --> 00:52:00,110
The door to the right, please.

605
00:52:08,332 --> 00:52:12,669
That was quite a performance.

606
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:17,670
The little shit should know better
than to play politics with me.

607
00:52:21,095 --> 00:52:25,390
I know I got in front of you,
old friend.

608
00:52:25,391 --> 00:52:30,391
I did what I thought was best.

609
00:52:34,984 --> 00:52:36,693
So...

610
00:52:36,694 --> 00:52:39,904
now what?

611
00:52:39,905 --> 00:52:44,905
Now we wait for the Teacher's call.

612
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,090
Good evening. I am André Vernet,
the night manager.

613
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:03,511
I take it this is your first visit
to our establishment?

614
00:53:03,512 --> 00:53:05,430
Yes.

615
00:53:05,431 --> 00:53:07,515
Understood.

616
00:53:07,516 --> 00:53:10,059
Keys are often passed on
and first-time users...

617
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:14,522
are sometimes
uncertain of protocol.

618
00:53:14,523 --> 00:53:18,943
Keys are essentially
numbered Swiss accounts.

619
00:53:18,944 --> 00:53:23,944
Often willed through generations.

620
00:53:24,408 --> 00:53:28,995
Is it yours, mademoiselle?

621
00:53:28,996 --> 00:53:32,999
The shortest safety-deposit-box
lease is 50 years.

622
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,251
And what's your longest account?

623
00:53:35,252 --> 00:53:37,295
Quite a bit longer.

624
00:53:37,296 --> 00:53:40,256
Technologies change,
keys are updated.

625
00:53:40,257 --> 00:53:45,257
But our accounts date back
to the beginning of banking itself.

626
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:51,017
Once the computer
confirms your key...

627
00:53:51,018 --> 00:53:54,854
enter your account number
and your box is retrieved.

628
00:53:54,855 --> 00:53:59,855
The room is yours,
as long as you like.

629
00:54:02,404 --> 00:54:06,157
What if I lost track
of my account number?

630
00:54:06,158 --> 00:54:09,911
How might I recover it?

631
00:54:09,912 --> 00:54:12,663
I'm afraid each key is paired
with a 10-digit number...

632
00:54:12,664 --> 00:54:14,916
known only to the account bearer.

633
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:17,627
I hope you manage to remember it.

634
00:54:17,628 --> 00:54:22,628
A single wrong entry
disables the system.

635
00:54:27,095 --> 00:54:27,595
- Ten.
- Ten.

636
00:54:27,596 --> 00:54:28,429
- Ten.
- Ten.

637
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:33,430
Your grandfather's
Fibonacci Sequence.

638
00:54:34,144 --> 00:54:37,438
Scrambled, unscrambled?

639
00:54:37,439 --> 00:54:39,440
Unscrambled.

640
00:54:39,441 --> 00:54:44,441
It's your key.

641
00:54:45,823 --> 00:54:50,823
Funny, I don't even like history.

642
00:54:52,663 --> 00:54:57,663
I've never seen much good come
from looking to the past.

643
00:55:04,633 --> 00:55:09,633
Moment of truth.

644
00:55:50,762 --> 00:55:53,723
My God. I don't believe this.

645
00:55:53,724 --> 00:55:54,224
A rose.

646
00:55:59,771 --> 00:56:04,442
The rose was a symbol
for the Holy Grail.

647
00:56:04,443 --> 00:56:06,235
Forgive the intrusion.

648
00:56:06,236 --> 00:56:10,740
I'm afraid the police arrived
more quickly than I anticipated.

649
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:12,742
You must follow me, please.

650
00:56:12,743 --> 00:56:14,452
For your own safety.

651
00:56:14,453 --> 00:56:16,245
You knew they were coming?

652
00:56:16,246 --> 00:56:19,207
My guard alerted me to your status
when you arrived.

653
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:22,251
Yours is one of our oldest
and highest-level accounts.

654
00:56:22,252 --> 00:56:24,712
It includes a safe-passage clause.

655
00:56:24,713 --> 00:56:26,756
Safe passage?

656
00:56:26,757 --> 00:56:31,757
If you would step inside, please.
Time is of the essence.

657
00:56:33,138 --> 00:56:33,750
In there?

658
00:56:48,777 --> 00:56:49,737
Hey, is there a problem?

659
00:56:49,738 --> 00:56:51,614
Hey, is there a problem?

660
00:56:51,615 --> 00:56:54,659
Good evening, sir. Police.

661
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:59,121
I just drive from here to Zurich.
Not French, English?

662
00:56:59,122 --> 00:57:01,666
- English?
- Yes.

663
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:05,503
We are looking for two criminals.

664
00:57:05,504 --> 00:57:10,174
You came to the right place.
They're all criminals here.

665
00:57:10,175 --> 00:57:13,052
Would you mind opening the hold?

666
00:57:13,053 --> 00:57:16,806
Please. You think they trust us,
the wages I get paid?

667
00:57:16,807 --> 00:57:18,849
You don't have keys
to your own truck?

668
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:21,394
It's armored.
Keys get sent to the destination.

669
00:57:21,395 --> 00:57:21,769
It's armored.
Keys get sent to the destination.

670
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:26,770
You mind? I'm on a schedule here.

671
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:32,280
And do all the drivers wear a Rolex?

672
00:57:32,281 --> 00:57:35,783
What?

673
00:57:35,784 --> 00:57:37,493
This piece of shit.

674
00:57:37,494 --> 00:57:39,495
Forty euros in Barbès.

675
00:57:39,496 --> 00:57:41,205
Yours for 35.

676
00:57:41,206 --> 00:57:42,415
No, no, no.

677
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:44,375
- Thirty.
- No. It's okay, it's okay.

678
00:57:44,376 --> 00:57:45,835
Come on, 30, eh?

679
00:57:45,836 --> 00:57:46,419
I said, no!

680
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,712
I said, no!

681
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:52,713
Move along!

682
00:58:02,227 --> 00:58:03,561
Now we wait.

683
00:58:03,562 --> 00:58:06,355
The Teacher will Call and tell me
where to deliver the money.

684
00:58:06,356 --> 00:58:09,942
You have put tremendous faith
in this Teacher of yours.

685
00:58:09,943 --> 00:58:14,697
Yes, I have. And I have given him
an angel to do his will.

686
00:58:14,698 --> 00:58:19,035
For surely there is no better
soldier for God than my Silas.

687
00:58:19,036 --> 00:58:24,036
I firmly resolve, with the help of
thy grace, to confess my sins...

688
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:39,972
to do penance
and to amend my life.

689
00:58:39,973 --> 00:58:40,473
Amen.

690
00:59:01,244 --> 00:59:06,244
I chastise my body.

691
00:59:19,638 --> 00:59:22,056
The Holy Grail.

692
00:59:22,057 --> 00:59:27,057
A magic cup.
The source of God's power on earth.

693
00:59:27,104 --> 00:59:29,355
It's nonsense.

694
00:59:29,356 --> 00:59:32,149
You don't believe in God.

695
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:34,110
No.

696
00:59:34,111 --> 00:59:39,111
I don't believe in some magic
from the sky.

697
00:59:39,783 --> 00:59:41,951
Just people.

698
00:59:41,952 --> 00:59:45,413
Sometimes that they can be kind.

699
00:59:45,414 --> 00:59:46,997
And that's enough?

700
00:59:46,998 --> 00:59:51,998
Well, I think it has to be.
I think it's all we have.

701
00:59:52,963 --> 00:59:56,632
Are you a God-fearing man,
professor?

702
00:59:56,633 --> 00:59:59,135
I was raised a Catholic.

703
00:59:59,136 --> 01:00:03,556
Well, that's not really an answer.

704
01:00:03,557 --> 01:00:06,642
Professor, are you okay?

705
01:00:06,643 --> 01:00:09,061
Go ahead, open it.

706
01:00:09,062 --> 01:00:09,562
Go on.

707
01:00:17,195 --> 01:00:19,864
A cryptex.

708
01:00:19,865 --> 01:00:23,159
They are used to keep secrets.

709
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,911
It's da Vinci's design.

710
01:00:25,912 --> 01:00:29,415
You write the information
on a papyrus scroll...

711
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:34,416
which is then rolled around
a thin glass vial of vinegar.

712
01:00:34,713 --> 01:00:38,132
If you force it open, the vial breaks...

713
01:00:38,133 --> 01:00:42,553
vinegar dissolves papyrus...

714
01:00:42,554 --> 01:00:45,514
and your secret is lost forever.

715
01:00:45,515 --> 01:00:47,767
The only way
to access the information...

716
01:00:47,768 --> 01:00:50,352
is to spell out the password...

717
01:00:50,353 --> 01:00:54,690
with these five dials,
each with 26 letters.

718
01:00:54,691 --> 01:00:59,069
That's 12 million possibilities.

719
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:03,908
I've never met a girl
who knew that much about a cryptex.

720
01:01:03,909 --> 01:01:08,909
Saunière made one for me once.

721
01:01:14,127 --> 01:01:19,127
My grandfather gave me a wagon.

722
01:01:19,883 --> 01:01:24,883
This clearly is not the Holy Grail.

723
01:01:26,056 --> 01:01:27,515
Come on.

724
01:01:27,516 --> 01:01:32,353
Please, you're not all right.

725
01:01:32,354 --> 01:01:34,480
May I try something?

726
01:01:34,481 --> 01:01:36,982
I don't know why it works.

727
01:01:36,983 --> 01:01:40,903
My mother used to do it
when I was scared, I think.

728
01:01:40,904 --> 01:01:42,988
You think?

729
01:01:42,989 --> 01:01:43,489
Yes.

730
01:01:56,086 --> 01:02:01,086
Feeling better, Sophie?

731
01:02:09,766 --> 01:02:14,766
My parents died in a car crash
with my brother.

732
01:02:15,564 --> 01:02:18,774
I was 4.

733
01:02:18,775 --> 01:02:21,485
I'm sorry.

734
01:02:21,486 --> 01:02:26,486
It was many years ago.

735
01:02:39,087 --> 01:02:43,048
Better?

736
01:02:43,049 --> 01:02:44,884
Yeah.

737
01:02:44,885 --> 01:02:45,385
Okay.

738
01:03:12,162 --> 01:03:14,955
Twenty years waiting
for someone to come for that box...

739
01:03:14,956 --> 01:03:18,292
and now it's you two murderers.
Bring it to me.

740
01:03:18,293 --> 01:03:21,170
I don't know what
you're talking about.

741
01:03:21,171 --> 01:03:23,839
All right! Okay!

742
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:28,840
Right now!

743
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:40,230
Step back!

744
01:03:40,231 --> 01:03:45,231
No one will lose sleep
over a couple on a killing spree.

745
01:03:45,862 --> 01:03:48,572
Turn around.

746
01:03:48,573 --> 01:03:50,324
Turn around!

747
01:03:50,325 --> 01:03:55,325
You too, mademoiselle.

748
01:04:14,599 --> 01:04:16,558
Sophie!

749
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,769
Get in the truck!

750
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:23,770
I'll drive! Hurry!

751
01:04:58,268 --> 01:05:01,687
- Better?
- Always, if I got too nervous...

752
01:05:01,688 --> 01:05:05,441
I had to put my head out
of the window not to be sick.

753
01:05:05,442 --> 01:05:09,445
Saunière used to say
I was like a dog.

754
01:05:09,446 --> 01:05:14,446
A cute dog. You know, a little dog.

755
01:05:22,876 --> 01:05:27,876
What happened between you
and your grandfather, Sophie?

756
01:05:28,923 --> 01:05:32,968
I've jammed my shoulder,
I've been shot at, I'm bleeding.

757
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:34,762
I need to know.

758
01:05:34,763 --> 01:05:38,432
You say he raised you,
but you two don't talk anymore.

759
01:05:38,433 --> 01:05:40,642
You call him by his last name.

760
01:05:40,643 --> 01:05:43,437
You say you hate history.

761
01:05:43,438 --> 01:05:45,898
Nobody hates history.
They hate their own histories.

762
01:05:45,899 --> 01:05:48,275
So now you're a psychologist too?

763
01:05:48,276 --> 01:05:52,654
What if Saunière had started
to groom you for the Priory?

764
01:05:52,655 --> 01:05:54,615
What do you mean, groom me?

765
01:05:54,616 --> 01:05:58,702
Your grandfather gave you puzzles
and cryptex as a child.

766
01:05:58,703 --> 01:06:03,165
<i>Say Saunière was hoping one day
you would join him in the Priory.</i>

767
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:06,085
Still, years later,
when he imagines...

768
01:06:06,086 --> 01:06:09,088
the Grail is in danger,
he reaches out to you.

769
01:06:09,089 --> 01:06:13,342
So you are saying all this is real?
The Priow, the Holy Grail?

770
01:06:13,343 --> 01:06:16,678
We've been dragged into a world
of people who think this stuff is real.

771
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:21,679
- Real enough to kill for.
- Who?

772
01:06:25,021 --> 01:06:29,983
I'm out of my field here.

773
01:06:29,984 --> 01:06:34,863
I do know a Grail historian,
absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.

774
01:06:34,864 --> 01:06:38,325
An Englishman,
lives here in France.

775
01:06:38,326 --> 01:06:41,036
Do you trust this man?

776
01:06:41,037 --> 01:06:46,037
I hope you can.

777
01:06:48,711 --> 01:06:52,214
Vernet, André.

778
01:06:52,215 --> 01:06:56,885
It seems you're not a driver at all.

779
01:06:56,886 --> 01:07:01,886
Apparently, you lost your tongue
along with your truck.

780
01:07:04,894 --> 01:07:09,273
Aiding and abetting
two murder suspects.

781
01:07:09,274 --> 01:07:12,234
That carries jail time.

782
01:07:12,235 --> 01:07:15,696
Speak to my lawyer.

783
01:07:15,697 --> 01:07:20,697
All this confusion, violence,
vanishing property...

784
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:27,871
It might get around that your bank is
less than ideal, don't you think?

785
01:07:31,171 --> 01:07:34,256
You think you're in pain now,
André Vernet?

786
01:07:34,257 --> 01:07:39,257
My cause is worth your life.
Understand?

787
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:44,516
What do you want?

788
01:07:44,517 --> 01:07:46,101
Your truck Carries a homing device.
Activate it.

789
01:07:46,102 --> 01:07:51,102
Your truck Carries a homing device.
Activate it.

790
01:07:57,697 --> 01:08:00,616
<i>Please wait.
I'll see if he's available.</i>

791
01:08:00,617 --> 01:08:02,451
It's on the wrong side.

792
01:08:02,452 --> 01:08:05,120
Leigh likes all things to be English,
including his cars.

793
01:08:05,121 --> 01:08:09,124
<i>Robert! Do I owe you money?</i>

794
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:12,211
Leigh, my friend...

795
01:08:12,212 --> 01:08:15,714
care to open up
for an old colleague?

796
01:08:15,715 --> 01:08:17,758
- Of course.
- Thank you.

797
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:20,761
<i>But first,</i> a <i>test of honor.</i>

798
01:08:20,762 --> 01:08:25,762
<i>Three questions.</i>

799
01:08:25,767 --> 01:08:27,142
Fire away.

800
01:08:27,143 --> 01:08:28,810
<i>Your first:</i>

801
01:08:28,811 --> 01:08:32,314
<i>Shall I serve coffee or tea?</i>

802
01:08:32,315 --> 01:08:33,899
Tea, of course.

803
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,150
<i>Excellent.</i>

804
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:38,487
<i>Second: Milk or /emon?</i>

805
01:08:38,488 --> 01:08:40,906
Milk?

806
01:08:40,907 --> 01:08:43,408
That would depend on the tea.

807
01:08:43,409 --> 01:08:45,410
<i>Correct.</i>

808
01:08:45,411 --> 01:08:49,831
<i>And now the third
and most grave of inquiries:</i>

809
01:08:49,832 --> 01:08:54,832
<i>In which year did a Harvard sculler
outrow an Oxford man at Henley?</i>

810
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:07,015
Surely such a travesty
has never occurred.

811
01:09:07,016 --> 01:09:09,768
<i>Your heart is true.</i>

812
01:09:09,769 --> 01:09:12,980
<i>You may pass.</i>

813
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:17,981
<i>Welcome to Château Vi/lette.</i>

814
01:09:19,862 --> 01:09:23,073
Leigh Teabing has spent
his entire life...

815
01:09:23,074 --> 01:09:26,118
studying the Grail.
That thing is one hot tamale.

816
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:27,703
Sorry?

817
01:09:27,704 --> 01:09:32,704
The cryptex, it's a hot Coal.

818
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:35,711
A hot potato?

819
01:09:35,712 --> 01:09:40,712
So you want to keep our chest
close to our cards, yes?

820
01:09:41,509 --> 01:09:46,509
Very close.

821
01:10:04,574 --> 01:10:07,409
<i>The truck's signal is coming online.</i>

822
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:12,410
It's about time.

823
01:10:12,582 --> 01:10:17,252
Locked on and tracking, sir.

824
01:10:17,253 --> 01:10:21,006
Very good. Tell Collet not to move in
until I get there.

825
01:10:21,007 --> 01:10:26,007
Attention! All of Collet's units
to Château Villette.

826
01:10:26,429 --> 01:10:31,429
<i>The suspects Neveu and Langdon
are likely at that location.</i>

827
01:10:46,282 --> 01:10:51,282
<i>Aringarosa.</i>

828
01:10:58,544 --> 01:11:02,297
I still don't know why
he put you into this...

829
01:11:02,298 --> 01:11:07,298
and I'm sorry.

830
01:11:09,305 --> 01:11:11,306
But...

831
01:11:11,307 --> 01:11:16,307
I'm also very glad.

832
01:11:31,369 --> 01:11:36,369
You are requested
to make yourself at home.

833
01:11:42,338 --> 01:11:44,631
Robert!

834
01:11:44,632 --> 01:11:47,384
And you travel with a maiden,
it seems.

835
01:11:47,385 --> 01:11:50,846
Sir Leigh Teabing,
may I present Miss Sophie Neveu.

836
01:11:50,847 --> 01:11:53,181
Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.

837
01:11:53,182 --> 01:11:57,602
It's an honor to welcome you...

838
01:11:57,603 --> 01:11:59,980
even though it's late.

839
01:11:59,981 --> 01:12:04,981
Thank you for having us.
I realize it's quite late.

840
01:12:05,069 --> 01:12:10,069
So late, mademoiselle,
it's almost early.

841
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:14,369
What a lovely smile you have.

842
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:16,371
Earl Grey?

843
01:12:16,372 --> 01:12:18,206
Lemon.

844
01:12:18,207 --> 01:12:18,751
Correct.

845
01:12:40,062 --> 01:12:45,062
Château Villette. Yes.

846
01:12:48,404 --> 01:12:50,280
- No.
- Oh, you must.

847
01:12:50,281 --> 01:12:53,241
Remy is from Lyons,
but nevertheless...

848
01:12:53,242 --> 01:12:54,910
he is fantastic with sauces.

849
01:12:54,911 --> 01:12:59,911
- Thank you.
- No, I can't.

850
01:13:01,918 --> 01:13:03,627
A dramatic late-night arrival.

851
01:13:03,628 --> 01:13:05,378
A dramatic late-night arrival.

852
01:13:05,379 --> 01:13:08,798
Mention of life and death.

853
01:13:08,799 --> 01:13:12,427
What can an old cripple
do for you, Robert?

854
01:13:12,428 --> 01:13:16,556
We wanna talk about
the Priow of Sion.

855
01:13:16,557 --> 01:13:18,725
The keepers?

856
01:13:18,726 --> 01:13:20,268
The secret war?

857
01:13:20,269 --> 01:13:22,979
Sorry for all the mystew.

858
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:26,441
Leigh, I'm into something here
that I cannot understand.

859
01:13:26,442 --> 01:13:28,360
You?

860
01:13:28,361 --> 01:13:32,155
- Really?
- Not without your help.

861
01:13:32,156 --> 01:13:35,450
Playing to my Vanity, Robert.
You should be ashamed.

862
01:13:35,451 --> 01:13:39,246
Not if it works.

863
01:13:39,247 --> 01:13:42,207
There are always four:

864
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:45,544
The Grand Master
and the three sénéchaux...

865
01:13:45,545 --> 01:13:50,545
make up the primary
guardians of the Grail.

866
01:13:50,883 --> 01:13:55,883
Thank you, Remy.
That'll be all for now.

867
01:13:59,433 --> 01:14:02,978
The Prion/'s members
span our very globe itself.

868
01:14:02,979 --> 01:14:07,607
Philippe de Chérisey
exposed that as a hoax in 1967.

869
01:14:07,608 --> 01:14:10,485
And that is what
they want you to believe.

870
01:14:10,486 --> 01:14:13,488
The Priow is charged
with a single task:

871
01:14:13,489 --> 01:14:16,992
To protect the greatest secret
in modern history.

872
01:14:16,993 --> 01:14:19,703
The source of God's power
on earth.

873
01:14:19,704 --> 01:14:21,496
No, that's a common
misunderstanding.

874
01:14:21,497 --> 01:14:26,497
The Priow protects the source
of the Church's power on earth:

875
01:14:27,169 --> 01:14:29,004
The Holy Grail.

876
01:14:29,005 --> 01:14:30,839
I don't understand.

877
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:35,677
What power? Some magic dishes?

878
01:14:35,678 --> 01:14:40,678
Robert. Has he been telling you
that the Holy Grail is a cup?

879
01:14:42,435 --> 01:14:44,394
To understand the Holy Grail,
my dear...

880
01:14:44,395 --> 01:14:49,395
you must first understand
the Holy Bible.

881
01:15:03,623 --> 01:15:08,209
The Good Book did not arrive
by facsimile from heaven.

882
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:12,881
The Bible as we know it
was finally presided over by one man:

883
01:15:12,882 --> 01:15:15,050
The pagan emperor Constantine.

884
01:15:15,051 --> 01:15:17,385
I thought Constantine
was a Christian.

885
01:15:17,386 --> 01:15:20,555
Oh, hardly, no.
He was a lifelong pagan...

886
01:15:20,556 --> 01:15:23,391
who was baptized
on his deathbed.

887
01:15:23,392 --> 01:15:27,062
Constantine was Rome's
Supreme holy man.

888
01:15:27,063 --> 01:15:28,730
<i>From time immemorial.</i> ..

889
01:15:28,731 --> 01:15:33,401
<i>His people had worshiped</i> a <i>balance
between nature's male deities...</i>

890
01:15:33,402 --> 01:15:37,739
and the goddess,
or Sacred feminine.

891
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:41,910
But a growing religious turmoil
was gripping Rome.

892
01:15:41,911 --> 01:15:43,995
Three centuries earlier...

893
01:15:43,996 --> 01:15:47,165
a young Jew named Jesus
had come along...

894
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:49,668
preaching love and a single God.

895
01:15:49,669 --> 01:15:53,254
Centuries after his crucifixion...

896
01:15:53,255 --> 01:15:56,257
<i>Christ's follo wers
had grown exponentially.</i> ..

897
01:15:56,258 --> 01:16:01,258
<i>And had started a religious war
against the pagans.</i>

898
01:16:03,891 --> 01:16:07,936
Or did the pagans commence war
against the Christians?

899
01:16:07,937 --> 01:16:11,398
Leigh, we can't be sure who began
the atrocities in that period.

900
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:14,526
We can at least agree that the
conflict grew to such proportions...

901
01:16:14,527 --> 01:16:17,278
that it threatened
to tear Rome in two.

902
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:20,782
So Constantine may have been
a lifelong pagan...

903
01:16:20,783 --> 01:16:22,784
but he was also a pragmatist.

904
01:16:22,785 --> 01:16:25,120
And in 325 anno Domini...

905
01:16:25,121 --> 01:16:30,121
he decided to unify Rome under
a single religion, Christianity.

906
01:16:30,418 --> 01:16:34,796
Christianity was on the rise.
He didn't want his empire torn apart.

907
01:16:34,797 --> 01:16:38,258
And to strengthen this new
Christian tradition...

908
01:16:38,259 --> 01:16:40,719
Constantine held
a famous ecumenical gathering...

909
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:43,763
known as the Council of Nicaea.

910
01:16:43,764 --> 01:16:45,432
<i>And at this Council...</i>

911
01:16:45,433 --> 01:16:50,433
<i>the many sects of Christian/ty
debated and voted on, well...</i>

912
01:16:50,521 --> 01:16:54,649
<i>everything, from the acceptance
and rejection of specific gospels...</i>

913
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:56,359
to the <i>date</i> for Easter...

914
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:59,654
to the administering
of the sacraments, and of course...

915
01:16:59,655 --> 01:17:02,157
the immortality of Jesus.

916
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:03,825
I don't follow.

917
01:17:03,826 --> 01:17:07,036
Well, ma chère,
until that moment in history...

918
01:17:07,037 --> 01:17:11,833
Jesus was viewed by many of his
followers as a mighty prophet...

919
01:17:11,834 --> 01:17:16,834
as a great and powerful man,
but a man nevertheless.

920
01:17:16,881 --> 01:17:19,132
A mortal man.

921
01:17:19,133 --> 01:17:22,427
Some Christians held
that Jesus was mortal.

922
01:17:22,428 --> 01:17:24,137
Some Christians believed
he was divine.

923
01:17:24,138 --> 01:17:25,346
Some Christians believed
he was divine.

924
01:17:25,347 --> 01:17:26,848
Not the Son of God?

925
01:17:26,849 --> 01:17:29,434
Not even his nephew twice removed.

926
01:17:29,435 --> 01:17:33,688
Hold on, you're saying
Jesus' divinity came from a Vote.

927
01:17:33,689 --> 01:17:36,941
Well, remember, in those days,
gods were everywhere.

928
01:17:36,942 --> 01:17:41,321
By infusing Jesus the man
with the divine magic...

929
01:17:41,322 --> 01:17:45,033
by making him capable
of earthly miracles...

930
01:17:45,034 --> 01:17:49,329
as well as his own resurrection,
Constantine turned him into a god...

931
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:51,706
but within the human world.

932
01:17:51,707 --> 01:17:55,293
And he basically knocked the more
distant gods out of the game.

933
01:17:55,294 --> 01:17:58,963
Constantine did not create
Jesus' divinity.

934
01:17:58,964 --> 01:18:03,134
He simply sanctioned
an already widely held idea.

935
01:18:03,135 --> 01:18:04,969
- Semantics.
- No, it's not semantics.

936
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:08,181
You're interpreting facts
to support your own conclusions.

937
01:18:08,182 --> 01:18:13,144
Fact: For many Christians, Jesus was
mortal one day and divine the next.

938
01:18:13,145 --> 01:18:15,396
For some Christians,
his divinity was enhanced.

939
01:18:15,397 --> 01:18:18,066
Absurd. There was a formal
announcement of his promotion.

940
01:18:18,067 --> 01:18:20,235
They couldn't even agree
on the Nicene Creed!

941
01:18:20,236 --> 01:18:25,236
Excuse me.
"Who is God, who is man?"

942
01:18:27,993 --> 01:18:31,704
How many have been murdered
over this question?

943
01:18:31,705 --> 01:18:34,833
As long as there has been
a one true God...

944
01:18:34,834 --> 01:18:39,834
there has been killing
in his name.

945
01:18:45,594 --> 01:18:50,594
Now let me show you the Grail.

946
01:18:56,355 --> 01:18:57,730
This used to be the ballroom.

947
01:18:57,731 --> 01:18:59,607
This used to be the ballroom.

948
01:18:59,608 --> 01:19:02,277
I have little occasion to dance
these days.

949
01:19:02,278 --> 01:19:05,530
I trust you recognize
The Last Supper...

950
01:19:05,531 --> 01:19:10,531
the great fresco by
Leonardo da Vinci.

951
01:19:11,912 --> 01:19:14,747
Now, my dear,
if you would close your eyes.

952
01:19:14,748 --> 01:19:17,166
Oh, Leigh, save us the parlor tricks.

953
01:19:17,167 --> 01:19:19,711
You asked for my help, I recall.

954
01:19:19,712 --> 01:19:24,712
Allow an old man his indulgences.

955
01:19:26,635 --> 01:19:30,638
Now, mademoiselle,
where is Jesus sitting?

956
01:19:30,639 --> 01:19:32,557
- In the middle.
- Good.

957
01:19:32,558 --> 01:19:35,602
He and his disciples
are breaking bread.

958
01:19:35,603 --> 01:19:38,354
And what drink?

959
01:19:38,355 --> 01:19:39,606
Wine. They drank wine.

960
01:19:39,607 --> 01:19:40,440
Wine. They drank wine.

961
01:19:40,441 --> 01:19:42,942
Splendid. And one final question:

962
01:19:42,943 --> 01:19:47,322
How many wineglasses
are there on the table?

963
01:19:47,323 --> 01:19:49,407
One? The Holy Grail?

964
01:19:49,408 --> 01:19:53,411
"Ope" Wur eyes.

965
01:19:53,412 --> 01:19:55,622
No single cup.

966
01:19:55,623 --> 01:19:57,040
No chalice.

967
01:19:57,041 --> 01:20:00,001
Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?

968
01:20:00,002 --> 01:20:03,338
Considering both the Bible
and standard Grail legend...

969
01:20:03,339 --> 01:20:08,339
celebrate this moment as the
definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.

970
01:20:10,346 --> 01:20:13,097
Now, Robert,
you could be of help to us.

971
01:20:13,098 --> 01:20:17,185
If you'd be so kind as to show us the
symbols for man and woman, please.

972
01:20:17,186 --> 01:20:22,186
No balloon animals.
I can make a great duck.

973
01:20:23,943 --> 01:20:28,279
This is the original icon for male.
It's a rudimentary phallus.

974
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,615
- Quite to the point.
- Yes, indeed.

975
01:20:30,616 --> 01:20:32,867
This is known as the blade.

976
01:20:32,868 --> 01:20:34,953
It represents aggression
and manhood.

977
01:20:34,954 --> 01:20:37,914
It's a symbol still used today
in modern military uniforms.

978
01:20:37,915 --> 01:20:42,168
Yes, the more penises you have, the
higher your rank. Boys will be boys.

979
01:20:42,169 --> 01:20:46,673
Now, as you would imagine, the
female symbol is its exact opposite.

980
01:20:46,674 --> 01:20:48,299
This is called the chalice.

981
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:53,300
And the chalice resembles a cup
or vessel or, more importantly...

982
01:20:53,305 --> 01:20:56,683
the Shape of a woman's womb.

983
01:20:56,684 --> 01:20:59,852
No, the Grail has never been a cup.

984
01:20:59,853 --> 01:21:04,853
It is quite literally this ancient
symbol of womanhood.

985
01:21:05,943 --> 01:21:10,943
And in this case, a woman who
carried a secret so powerful...

986
01:21:11,281 --> 01:21:15,785
that if revealed, it would devastate
the very foundations of Christianity.

987
01:21:15,786 --> 01:21:17,245
Wait, please.

988
01:21:17,246 --> 01:21:22,246
You're saying the Holy Grail
is a person? A woman?

989
01:21:22,626 --> 01:21:27,213
And it turns out, she makes
an appearance right there.

990
01:21:27,214 --> 01:21:29,048
But they are all men.

991
01:21:29,049 --> 01:21:30,383
Are they?

992
01:21:30,384 --> 01:21:32,969
What about that figure
on the right hand of our Lord...

993
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:36,514
seated in the place of honor?

994
01:21:36,515 --> 01:21:39,475
Flowing red hair.

995
01:21:39,476 --> 01:21:42,937
Folded feminine hands.

996
01:21:42,938 --> 01:21:47,938
Hint of a bosom. No?

997
01:21:50,863 --> 01:21:54,574
It's called scotoma.
The mind sees what it chooses to see.

998
01:21:54,575 --> 01:21:57,243
Who is she?

999
01:21:57,244 --> 01:21:59,495
My dear, that's Mary Magdalene.

1000
01:21:59,496 --> 01:22:01,497
The prostitute?

1001
01:22:01,498 --> 01:22:03,374
She was no such thing.

1002
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:08,375
Smeared by the Church
in 591 anno Domini, poor dear.

1003
01:22:10,424 --> 01:22:15,424
Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.

1004
01:22:20,267 --> 01:22:22,435
This is an old wives' tale.

1005
01:22:22,436 --> 01:22:24,062
The original one, in fact.

1006
01:22:24,063 --> 01:22:26,355
There's virtually no empirical proof.

1007
01:22:26,356 --> 01:22:29,734
He knows as well as I do
there's much evidence to support it.

1008
01:22:29,735 --> 01:22:31,611
Theories. There are theories.

1009
01:22:31,612 --> 01:22:36,199
Notice how Jesus and Mary
are clothed.

1010
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,451
Mirror images of each other.

1011
01:22:38,452 --> 01:22:41,120
The mind sees
what it chooses to see.

1012
01:22:41,121 --> 01:22:45,750
And venturing into the even more
bizarre, notice how Jesus and Mary...

1013
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:49,462
appear to be joined at the hip and
are leaning away from each other...

1014
01:22:49,463 --> 01:22:54,463
as if to create a shape in the
negative space between them.

1015
01:22:55,010 --> 01:23:00,010
Leonardo gives us the chalice.

1016
01:23:00,891 --> 01:23:03,684
Yes. Oh, and Robert,
notice what happens...

1017
01:23:03,685 --> 01:23:07,688
when these two figures
change position.

1018
01:23:07,689 --> 01:23:11,192
Just because da Vinci painted it
doesn't make it true.

1019
01:23:11,193 --> 01:23:13,486
No. But history...

1020
01:23:13,487 --> 01:23:15,488
she does make it true.

1021
01:23:15,489 --> 01:23:18,908
Now, listen to this. It's from
the Gospel according to Philip.

1022
01:23:18,909 --> 01:23:20,118
Philip?

1023
01:23:20,119 --> 01:23:23,162
Yes, it was rejected
at the Council of Nicaea...

1024
01:23:23,163 --> 01:23:25,373
along with any other gospels
that made...

1025
01:23:25,374 --> 01:23:28,042
Jesus appear human
and not divine.

1026
01:23:28,043 --> 01:23:33,043
"And the Companion of the Savior
is Mary Magdalene."

1027
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:37,260
Christ loved her more
than all the disciples...

1028
01:23:37,261 --> 01:23:39,345
and used to kiss her on the...

1029
01:23:39,346 --> 01:23:41,389
But this says nothing of marriage.

1030
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:44,267
Well, actually...

1031
01:23:44,268 --> 01:23:45,935
Robert.

1032
01:23:45,936 --> 01:23:50,773
Actually, in those days, the word
"Companion" literally meant "spouse."

1033
01:23:50,774 --> 01:23:55,403
And this is from the Gospel
of Mary Magdalene herself.

1034
01:23:55,404 --> 01:23:58,281
- She wrote a gospel?
- She may have.

1035
01:23:58,282 --> 01:24:01,409
- Robert, will you fight fair?
- She may have.

1036
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:06,372
"And Peter said,
'Did he prefer her to us?'."

1037
01:24:06,373 --> 01:24:07,832
And Levi answered:

1038
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:12,128
'Peter, I see you contending
against a woman like an adversary.

1039
01:24:12,129 --> 01:24:16,799
If the Savior made her worthy,
who are you, indeed, to reject her?"'

1040
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:21,470
Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus
goes on to tell Mary Magdalene...

1041
01:24:21,471 --> 01:24:26,434
that it's up to her
to continue his Church.

1042
01:24:26,435 --> 01:24:29,937
Mary Magdalene, not Peter.

1043
01:24:29,938 --> 01:24:34,192
The Church was supposed
to be carried on by a woman.

1044
01:24:34,193 --> 01:24:39,193
Few realize that Mary was descended
from kings, just as her husband was.

1045
01:24:39,489 --> 01:24:44,489
Now, my dear, the word
in French for Holy Grail.

1046
01:24:46,163 --> 01:24:49,498
From the Middle English
"Sangreal"...

1047
01:24:49,499 --> 01:24:52,293
of the original Arthurian legend.

1048
01:24:52,294 --> 01:24:57,294
Now, as two words.
Can you translate for our friend?

1049
01:24:59,134 --> 01:25:03,304
Sang <i>real,</i> it means "royal blood."

1050
01:25:03,305 --> 01:25:08,100
When the legend speaks of the
chalice that held the blood of Christ...

1051
01:25:08,101 --> 01:25:13,101
it speaks in fact of the female womb
that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.

1052
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:17,443
But how could Christ
have a bloodline, unless...?

1053
01:25:17,444 --> 01:25:22,444
Mary was pregnant
at the time of the Crucifixion.

1054
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:33,376
<i>For her own safety and for that
of Christ's unborn child...</i>

1055
01:25:33,377 --> 01:25:36,671
<i>she f/ed the Holy Land
and came to France.</i>

1056
01:25:36,672 --> 01:25:41,672
<i>And here, it is said,
she gave birth to</i> a <i>daughter, Sarah.</i>

1057
01:25:42,928 --> 01:25:46,264
They know the child's name.

1058
01:25:46,265 --> 01:25:48,349
- A little girl.
- Yes.

1059
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:50,643
If that were true,
it's adding insult to injury.

1060
01:25:50,644 --> 01:25:51,894
Why?

1061
01:25:51,895 --> 01:25:55,731
The pagans found transcendence
through the joining of male to female.

1062
01:25:55,732 --> 01:25:57,650
People found God through sex?

1063
01:25:57,651 --> 01:26:00,695
<i>In paganism, women were worshiped
as a route to heaven...</i>

1064
01:26:00,696 --> 01:26:03,698
but the modern Church
has a monopoly on that...

1065
01:26:03,699 --> 01:26:06,158
in salvation through Jesus Christ.

1066
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:09,078
And he who keeps the keys to heaven
rules the world.

1067
01:26:09,079 --> 01:26:12,456
Women, then, are a huge threat
to the Church.

1068
01:26:12,457 --> 01:26:14,500
<i>The Catholic inquisition
soon publishes...</i>

1069
01:26:14,501 --> 01:26:18,004
<i>what may be the most
b/ood-soaked book in human history.</i>

1070
01:26:18,005 --> 01:26:21,507
<i>The Ma/leus Ma/eficarum.</i>

1071
01:26:21,508 --> 01:26:23,467
<i>The Witches' Hammer.</i>

1072
01:26:23,468 --> 01:26:27,388
It instructed the clergy on how
to locate, torture and kill...

1073
01:26:27,389 --> 01:26:32,389
all freethinking women.

1074
01:26:32,811 --> 01:26:35,438
In three centuries of witch hunts...

1075
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:39,358
50, <i>000 women are captured,
burned alive at the steke.</i>

1076
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:42,570
<i>Oh, at least that.
Some say millions.</i>

1077
01:26:42,571 --> 01:26:44,196
Imagine, then, Robert...

1078
01:26:44,197 --> 01:26:44,780
Imagine, then, Robert...

1079
01:26:44,781 --> 01:26:49,660
that Christ's throne
might live on in a female child.

1080
01:26:49,661 --> 01:26:53,164
You asked what would
be worth killing for.

1081
01:26:53,165 --> 01:26:57,626
Witness the greatest cover-up
in human history.

1082
01:26:57,627 --> 01:27:00,087
This is the secret
that the Priory of Sion...

1083
01:27:00,088 --> 01:27:02,673
has defended
for over 20 centuries.

1084
01:27:02,674 --> 01:27:06,385
They are the guardians
of the royal bloodline.

1085
01:27:06,386 --> 01:27:10,056
The keepers of the proof
of our true past.

1086
01:27:10,057 --> 01:27:15,057
They are the protectors of the living
descendants of Jesus Christ...

1087
01:27:16,188 --> 01:27:21,188
and Mary Magdalene.

1088
01:27:27,699 --> 01:27:29,742
<i>Sir Leigh?</i>

1089
01:27:29,743 --> 01:27:33,746
Sometimes I wonder
who is serving whom.

1090
01:27:33,747 --> 01:27:35,206
His sauces are not that fantastic.

1091
01:27:35,207 --> 01:27:39,168
His sauces are not that fantastic.

1092
01:27:39,169 --> 01:27:40,836
<i>Yes, can I help you?</i>

1093
01:27:40,837 --> 01:27:45,837
Yes. They're on the news now.

1094
01:27:45,926 --> 01:27:49,428
Living descendants? Is it possible?

1095
01:27:49,429 --> 01:27:52,306
It's not impossible.

1096
01:27:52,307 --> 01:27:56,060
You have not been honest with me.
Your pictures are on the television.

1097
01:27:56,061 --> 01:27:58,396
You are wanted for four murders!

1098
01:27:58,397 --> 01:28:00,856
That's why Vernet said
"killing spree."

1099
01:28:00,857 --> 01:28:04,485
You come into my home,
playing on my passions for the Grail.

1100
01:28:04,486 --> 01:28:07,154
- That's why he needed you.
- You will leave my house!

1101
01:28:07,155 --> 01:28:09,365
- Leigh, listen!
- No, I'm Calling the police.

1102
01:28:09,366 --> 01:28:14,366
Jacques Saunière
was her grandfather.

1103
01:28:14,579 --> 01:28:16,414
You're the obsessive Priory scholar.

1104
01:28:16,415 --> 01:28:19,834
You still keep lists
of who might be in the Priory?

1105
01:28:19,835 --> 01:28:24,630
I'll bet Jacques Saunière
was on one of those lists.

1106
01:28:24,631 --> 01:28:27,466
He was on your list of who could
be Grand Master, wasn't he?

1107
01:28:27,467 --> 01:28:30,219
- What?
- I'll bet he was right at the top.

1108
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:35,220
Consider: Four men murdered?
The same number as the guardians.

1109
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:39,061
What if the Priory was compromised,
the other <i>sénéchaux</i> dead?

1110
01:28:39,062 --> 01:28:41,814
What if you yourself were dying,
a Grand Master?

1111
01:28:41,815 --> 01:28:45,484
You'd have to pass the secret on
to someone you could trust.

1112
01:28:45,485 --> 01:28:47,361
Someone outside the society.

1113
01:28:47,362 --> 01:28:52,362
Maybe someone whose training
you had begun but never finished.

1114
01:28:54,953 --> 01:28:58,581
Robert, your ruse is pathetic.

1115
01:28:58,582 --> 01:29:01,542
Not really.

1116
01:29:01,543 --> 01:29:06,543
No, that's impossible.

1117
01:29:06,882 --> 01:29:10,926
Can that really...?

1118
01:29:10,927 --> 01:29:15,598
Is it the keystone?

1119
01:29:15,599 --> 01:29:18,309
I'll even show it to you, Leigh.

1120
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:23,310
Will you just tell us
what the hell it's for?

1121
01:29:38,413 --> 01:29:40,372
Fache says to wait, so I wait.

1122
01:29:40,373 --> 01:29:41,123
What's Fache thinking?
The truck is here. They're inside.

1123
01:29:41,124 --> 01:29:46,124
What's Fache thinking?
The truck is here. They're inside.

1124
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:54,553
Yes.

1125
01:29:54,554 --> 01:29:59,141
As the legend foretold:

1126
01:29:59,142 --> 01:30:01,519
"It hides beneath the Rose."

1127
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,020
<i>Oh, mY-</i>

1128
01:30:10,028 --> 01:30:10,528
Leigh.

1129
01:30:14,908 --> 01:30:17,284
Leigh?

1130
01:30:17,285 --> 01:30:18,494
Please.

1131
01:30:18,495 --> 01:30:22,915
I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

1132
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:26,293
Inside the keystone...

1133
01:30:26,294 --> 01:30:28,003
there'll be a map.

1134
01:30:28,004 --> 01:30:33,004
A map that will lead us
to the Holy Grail.

1135
01:30:34,761 --> 01:30:38,138
To be trained by
the Grand Master himself.

1136
01:30:38,139 --> 01:30:43,139
Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis?
Is that how you found this?

1137
01:30:44,521 --> 01:30:47,606
And he must have sung you
the riddle songs.

1138
01:30:47,607 --> 01:30:52,607
I know some of them.

1139
01:30:58,410 --> 01:31:01,829
Can you keep secrets?

1140
01:31:01,830 --> 01:31:05,791
Can you know a thing
and never say it again?

1141
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:08,127
And Codes?

1142
01:31:08,128 --> 01:31:13,128
I imagine they lie down
for you like lovers.

1143
01:31:15,135 --> 01:31:20,135
A <i>sénéchal.</i> A guardian of the Grail
right here in my own home.

1144
01:31:20,223 --> 01:31:23,309
Tell him, please.
I don't know any of this.

1145
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:27,730
Leigh, it's not that simple.
She doesn't rem...

1146
01:31:27,731 --> 01:31:28,231
Robert!

1147
01:31:34,321 --> 01:31:39,321
Do not move, woman.

1148
01:31:39,951 --> 01:31:43,329
Cripple.

1149
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:46,040
Put the box on the table.

1150
01:31:46,041 --> 01:31:48,000
What, this trifle?

1151
01:31:48,001 --> 01:31:52,171
Well, perhaps we can make
a financial arrangement.

1152
01:31:52,172 --> 01:31:56,175
Put the keystone on the table.

1153
01:31:56,176 --> 01:32:00,095
You will not succeed.

1154
01:32:00,096 --> 01:32:05,096
Only the worthy
can unlock the stone.

1155
01:32:32,671 --> 01:32:37,671
Rip the gate down.

1156
01:32:38,551 --> 01:32:43,551
Well, well, my dear.

1157
01:32:44,432 --> 01:32:45,933
Sit down.

1158
01:32:45,934 --> 01:32:47,559
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1159
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,895
- Are you?
- Yeah.

1160
01:32:49,896 --> 01:32:52,439
Yes, well, make yourself useful,
you French fool.

1161
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:57,440
Get something
to restrain this monster.

1162
01:32:59,614 --> 01:33:02,074
Above the joint.

1163
01:33:02,075 --> 01:33:06,829
Fortunately,
a dragon most easy to slay.

1164
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:09,039
He's wearing a cilice.

1165
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:13,752
- A what?
- Well, look.

1166
01:33:13,753 --> 01:33:18,753
Inflicts pain so he can suffer
as Christ suffered.

1167
01:33:19,759 --> 01:33:22,928
Not so common these days.

1168
01:33:22,929 --> 01:33:25,013
Opus Dei.

1169
01:33:25,014 --> 01:33:30,014
Remy, take care of this.

1170
01:33:31,813 --> 01:33:34,565
Fache is Opus Dei.

1171
01:33:34,566 --> 01:33:37,735
The policeman Who's Chasing us.
He wears the cross in the world.

1172
01:33:37,736 --> 01:33:41,697
Robert.

1173
01:33:41,698 --> 01:33:46,285
Well, I must say,
you two are anything but dull.

1174
01:33:46,286 --> 01:33:49,455
Leigh?

1175
01:33:49,456 --> 01:33:50,914
You want what's in this box?

1176
01:33:50,915 --> 01:33:52,499
You want what's in this box?

1177
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,460
We need a way out of here.

1178
01:33:54,461 --> 01:33:57,546
Well, actually...

1179
01:33:57,547 --> 01:34:02,547
I do have a plane.

1180
01:34:09,809 --> 01:34:11,852
<i>- Robertl Where do we go?
- Come along.</i>

1181
01:34:11,853 --> 01:34:13,854
<i>- In here. Come in.
- Over here.</i>

1182
01:34:13,855 --> 01:34:18,400
<i>Get the door. Hurry.</i>

1183
01:34:18,401 --> 01:34:20,527
<i>Over here. Over here. Sophie.</i>

1184
01:34:20,528 --> 01:34:23,280
<i>Watch out!</i>

1185
01:34:23,281 --> 01:34:25,199
<i>Be careful.</i>

1186
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:30,200
Come, Rem...

1187
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:34,458
Shit.

1188
01:34:38,338 --> 01:34:38,838
Easy.

1189
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,529
Jesus!

1190
01:35:03,530 --> 01:35:07,407
Apropos.

1191
01:35:07,408 --> 01:35:09,451
I can't imagine
what your complaint is.

1192
01:35:09,452 --> 01:35:12,663
I'd be within my rights to shoot you
and let you rot in my woods!

1193
01:35:12,664 --> 01:35:15,666
Put that away. We might need him.

1194
01:35:15,667 --> 01:35:16,167
Better.

1195
01:35:23,758 --> 01:35:26,385
Opus Dei.

1196
01:35:26,386 --> 01:35:29,096
- What is it?
- A conservative Catholic sect.

1197
01:35:29,097 --> 01:35:31,139
Opus Dei is a prelature
to the Vatican.

1198
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:34,685
You're saying the Vatican
is killing people for this box?

1199
01:35:34,686 --> 01:35:36,812
No, no, no. Not the Vatican...

1200
01:35:36,813 --> 01:35:39,523
and not Opus Dei,
but we are in the middle of a war.

1201
01:35:39,524 --> 01:35:42,150
And one that has been
going on forever.

1202
01:35:42,151 --> 01:35:44,611
On the one side stands the Priory...

1203
01:35:44,612 --> 01:35:47,447
and on the other
an ancient group of despots...

1204
01:35:47,448 --> 01:35:49,908
with members hidden
in high-ranking positions...

1205
01:35:49,909 --> 01:35:51,869
throughout the Church.

1206
01:35:51,870 --> 01:35:56,707
And this Council of Shadows tries
to destroy proof of the bloodline.

1207
01:35:56,708 --> 01:35:59,585
And that throughout history,
they seek out and kill...

1208
01:35:59,586 --> 01:36:01,712
the living descendants
of Jesus Christ.

1209
01:36:01,713 --> 01:36:03,630
- That's insane.
- Is it?

1210
01:36:03,631 --> 01:36:06,383
How many atrocities and scandals
has the Catholic Church...

1211
01:36:06,384 --> 01:36:08,677
rationalized in its time?
And what happens...

1212
01:36:08,678 --> 01:36:11,638
if some persuasive scientific
evidence emerges that shows...

1213
01:36:11,639 --> 01:36:16,435
that the Church's version of Christ
is inaccurate?

1214
01:36:16,436 --> 01:36:17,936
What if the world discovers...

1215
01:36:17,937 --> 01:36:20,856
that the greatest story ever told
is actually a lie?

1216
01:36:20,857 --> 01:36:25,277
The Vatican faces a Crisis of faith
unprecedented.

1217
01:36:25,278 --> 01:36:30,073
I've got a signal now, sir.
It's ringing.

1218
01:36:30,074 --> 01:36:35,074
Roger, look, I'm so sorry. I've got
tired of the weather here in France...

1219
01:36:35,204 --> 01:36:40,083
and could you make
the plane ready for...

1220
01:36:40,084 --> 01:36:41,835
Zurich.

1221
01:36:41,836 --> 01:36:46,836
Yes. No, we love Zurich.

1222
01:36:51,262 --> 01:36:55,933
What the hell do you mean,
you lost them? Collet.

1223
01:36:55,934 --> 01:36:57,768
You're the one who lost them.

1224
01:36:57,769 --> 01:36:59,478
You control every step
of this investigation.

1225
01:36:59,479 --> 01:37:02,397
You don't let anybody breathe.

1226
01:37:02,398 --> 01:37:07,398
You're acting like
you lost your mind.

1227
01:37:08,488 --> 01:37:13,488
What is it with these two birds?

1228
01:37:14,953 --> 01:37:18,705
Interpol just registered a new
flight plan from Le Bourget.

1229
01:37:18,706 --> 01:37:23,706
Stay out of my way on this, Collet.

1230
01:37:49,904 --> 01:37:54,904
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1231
01:37:55,201 --> 01:37:58,203
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1232
01:37:58,204 --> 01:38:03,204
I am the messenger of God.

1233
01:38:03,876 --> 01:38:08,876
Did you kill my grandfather?

1234
01:38:09,173 --> 01:38:11,299
I am the messenger...

1235
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:16,300
Each breath you take is a sin.

1236
01:38:16,848 --> 01:38:19,433
No shadow will be safe again.

1237
01:38:19,434 --> 01:38:24,434
For you will be hunted by angels.

1238
01:38:25,606 --> 01:38:28,859
You believe in God?

1239
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:33,860
Your God doesn't
forgive murderers.

1240
01:38:34,907 --> 01:38:39,907
He burns them.

1241
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:48,420
Sophie.

1242
01:39:30,338 --> 01:39:32,089
The Teacher will be pleased.

1243
01:39:32,090 --> 01:39:34,508
What will you do
once you have the Grail?

1244
01:39:34,509 --> 01:39:35,967
Destroy it.

1245
01:39:35,968 --> 01:39:40,931
The documents and the
sarcophagus, of course.

1246
01:39:40,932 --> 01:39:45,932
And the heir?

1247
01:39:46,145 --> 01:39:50,190
Will you exercise the final edict?
Spill his blood?

1248
01:39:50,191 --> 01:39:51,858
There will be no need.

1249
01:39:51,859 --> 01:39:56,780
Once the sarcophagus is destroyed,
DNA testing will be impossible.

1250
01:39:56,781 --> 01:40:00,200
There is no way to prove
a living bloodline.

1251
01:40:00,201 --> 01:40:03,495
But if you had to...

1252
01:40:03,496 --> 01:40:05,956
would you do as councils
have done before us?

1253
01:40:05,957 --> 01:40:10,957
Would you do as councils
have done before us?

1254
01:40:15,508 --> 01:40:16,120
Christ...

1255
01:40:21,722 --> 01:40:26,722
Christ sacrificed his life
for the betterment of humanity.

1256
01:40:29,438 --> 01:40:34,438
So, too, may be the fate of his seed.

1257
01:40:41,993 --> 01:40:43,702
Robert.

1258
01:40:43,703 --> 01:40:48,703
When we land, you must go
straight to your embassy.

1259
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,419
Is that so?

1260
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:54,713
Don't you see it?

1261
01:40:54,714 --> 01:40:57,257
They never wanted you.

1262
01:40:57,258 --> 01:41:00,177
Maybe even Fache didn't.

1263
01:41:00,178 --> 01:41:03,430
It's all about this...

1264
01:41:03,431 --> 01:41:08,431
idiotic little box.

1265
01:41:09,937 --> 01:41:12,564
That's not too flattering.

1266
01:41:12,565 --> 01:41:15,275
Crazy old man.

1267
01:41:15,276 --> 01:41:17,903
Why leave me with this?

1268
01:41:17,904 --> 01:41:22,904
I should just throw it away.

1269
01:41:24,785 --> 01:41:27,621
He trusted you, Sophie.

1270
01:41:27,622 --> 01:41:32,542
A guardian of the Holy Grail.

1271
01:41:32,543 --> 01:41:36,129
It Sounds so stupid.

1272
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:40,717
It's quite an honor,
if you think about it...

1273
01:41:40,718 --> 01:41:42,469
and take it seriously.

1274
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:45,889
He took it seriously enough
to get himself killed.

1275
01:41:45,890 --> 01:41:50,890
Not him. You.

1276
01:41:50,895 --> 01:41:54,064
He was the only family I knew.

1277
01:41:54,065 --> 01:41:57,984
And maybe I didn't know him at all.

1278
01:41:57,985 --> 01:41:58,526
I'm his marionette, Robert.

1279
01:41:58,527 --> 01:42:00,153
I'm his marionette, Robert.

1280
01:42:00,154 --> 01:42:05,154
Like a girl again,
just with no gift at the end.

1281
01:42:08,996 --> 01:42:13,625
But you've done enough.

1282
01:42:13,626 --> 01:42:18,626
I don't know why Saunière
picked me to help you, Sophie.

1283
01:42:20,591 --> 01:42:25,591
But I won't leave you alone
in all this.

1284
01:42:30,268 --> 01:42:35,268
Two marionettes, then.

1285
01:42:35,731 --> 01:42:40,731
Maybe this is why he Chose you.

1286
01:42:41,028 --> 01:42:46,028
Because you will stay.

1287
01:42:58,879 --> 01:43:00,964
I need the flight plan.

1288
01:43:00,965 --> 01:43:02,966
Ten minutes.

1289
01:43:02,967 --> 01:43:06,469
I asked you to get it for me.

1290
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:09,848
I'm on break.

1291
01:43:09,849 --> 01:43:13,435
Come back in 10 minutes.

1292
01:43:13,436 --> 01:43:16,187
My nose! My nose!

1293
01:43:16,188 --> 01:43:17,731
The flight plan, please.

1294
01:43:17,732 --> 01:43:22,732
You asshole!

1295
01:43:32,038 --> 01:43:34,998
It's not "cross."

1296
01:43:34,999 --> 01:43:39,999
Ilspearll?

1297
01:43:43,299 --> 01:43:45,592
What happened to her?

1298
01:43:45,593 --> 01:43:47,635
No one knows.

1299
01:43:47,636 --> 01:43:52,636
<i>Mary Magdalene lived out
her days in hiding.</i>

1300
01:43:52,641 --> 01:43:55,643
And the zealots pursued her still...

1301
01:43:55,644 --> 01:44:00,644
even in death, trying to destroy
proof of her existence.

1302
01:44:01,025 --> 01:44:03,568
But she always had her Knights.

1303
01:44:03,569 --> 01:44:06,196
<i>Brave men sworn to defend her.</i>

1304
01:44:06,197 --> 01:44:09,282
<i>You see, to worship
before her sarcophagus...</i>

1305
01:44:09,283 --> 01:44:12,744
<i>to knee/ before the bones
of Mary Magdalena...</i>

1306
01:44:12,745 --> 01:44:16,081
was to remember all those
who were robbed of their power...

1307
01:44:16,082 --> 01:44:17,499
who were oppressed.

1308
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:22,128
Ultimately, the Priory hid her remains
and the proof of her bloodline...

1309
01:44:22,129 --> 01:44:25,799
until most believed
her sarcophagus...

1310
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:28,468
<i>the Holy Grail...</i>

1311
01:44:28,469 --> 01:44:33,469
was finally lost in time.

1312
01:44:42,358 --> 01:44:43,566
What are you doing?

1313
01:44:43,567 --> 01:44:46,403
At the Chateau, you said,
"it hides beneath the Rose."

1314
01:44:46,404 --> 01:44:47,987
No, no, no. Do be careful.

1315
01:44:47,988 --> 01:44:51,783
In Latin, sub rosa.
Literal translation...

1316
01:44:51,784 --> 01:44:56,784
"Beneath the rose."

1317
01:45:06,382 --> 01:45:08,049
We need a mirror.

1318
01:45:08,050 --> 01:45:11,094
Backwards. In the style
of Leonardo himself.

1319
01:45:11,095 --> 01:45:16,095
Thank you.

1320
01:45:17,101 --> 01:45:21,271
<i>In London lies a knight</i>
a <i>Pope interred.</i>

1321
01:45:21,272 --> 01:45:25,358
<i>His labor's fruit</i>
a <i>Holy Wrath incurred.</i>

1322
01:45:25,359 --> 01:45:28,695
<i>You seek the orb
that ought be on his tomb</i>

1323
01:45:28,696 --> 01:45:32,532
<i>it speaks of Rosy flesh
and seeded womb.</i>

1324
01:45:32,533 --> 01:45:36,703
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred"?

1325
01:45:36,704 --> 01:45:40,707
A knight whose funeral
was presided over by the Pope.

1326
01:45:40,708 --> 01:45:44,043
Of course, the Priory knights
were not just any knights.

1327
01:45:44,044 --> 01:45:44,294
Templars.

1328
01:45:44,295 --> 01:45:45,253
Templars.

1329
01:45:45,254 --> 01:45:48,548
And there's just one place to bury
a Templar knight in London.

1330
01:45:48,549 --> 01:45:49,883
Temple Church.

1331
01:45:49,884 --> 01:45:52,218
Temple Church.
If you'll excuse me, my dear...

1332
01:45:52,219 --> 01:45:55,263
Roger and I must discuss
a Change in flight plan.

1333
01:45:55,264 --> 01:45:58,391
Leigh.

1334
01:45:58,392 --> 01:46:01,561
Harboring and transporting
fugitives?

1335
01:46:01,562 --> 01:46:05,315
You are already implicated enough.

1336
01:46:05,316 --> 01:46:09,110
You and I, Robert,
have observed history.

1337
01:46:09,111 --> 01:46:11,905
Time has been our glass.

1338
01:46:11,906 --> 01:46:16,826
We are in history now. Living it.

1339
01:46:16,827 --> 01:46:19,162
Making it.

1340
01:46:19,163 --> 01:46:20,830
"Implicated"?

1341
01:46:20,831 --> 01:46:25,001
I am on a Grail quest.

1342
01:46:25,002 --> 01:46:26,711
Forgive me, Robert...

1343
01:46:26,712 --> 01:46:29,214
but you two may well
have given this old man...

1344
01:46:29,215 --> 01:46:33,426
the greatest night of his life.

1345
01:46:33,427 --> 01:46:36,638
Thank you.

1346
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:41,639
He's going to want more money.

1347
01:46:55,908 --> 01:47:00,203
I suppose this is a new technique
for investigations.

1348
01:47:00,204 --> 01:47:05,204
I've lost them.
They flew to Switzerland.

1349
01:47:05,584 --> 01:47:10,547
No extradition.

1350
01:47:10,548 --> 01:47:15,548
The controller filed Charges.
Ari was on dispatch. He called me.

1351
01:47:20,933 --> 01:47:25,933
What's going on, Bezu?

1352
01:47:27,022 --> 01:47:30,275
You know that I am Opus Dei?

1353
01:47:30,276 --> 01:47:30,776
Yes.

1354
01:47:37,116 --> 01:47:40,952
A bishop of my order called me.

1355
01:47:40,953 --> 01:47:43,246
He said a killer
came to him in confession.

1356
01:47:43,247 --> 01:47:47,166
His name was Robert Langdon.

1357
01:47:47,167 --> 01:47:50,503
He said I couldn't imagine
the evil in this man's heart.

1358
01:47:50,504 --> 01:47:53,590
That he would keep killing.

1359
01:47:53,591 --> 01:47:58,094
He said I had to stop him.

1360
01:47:58,095 --> 01:48:02,098
The bishop broke his vows
to tell me this.

1361
01:48:02,099 --> 01:48:07,099
He charged me
to stop Robert Langdon.

1362
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,440
Tell me, Collet, who have I failed?

1363
01:48:10,441 --> 01:48:14,027
Tell me, Collet, who have I failed?

1364
01:48:14,028 --> 01:48:17,155
The bishop?

1365
01:48:17,156 --> 01:48:22,156
God himself?

1366
01:48:27,875 --> 01:48:32,875
They've changed their flight plan
to London.

1367
01:48:36,884 --> 01:48:41,554
Go on, Fache.
I'll take care of the controller.

1368
01:48:41,555 --> 01:48:46,555
Maybe he needs a few extra euros.

1369
01:48:47,561 --> 01:48:52,561
Just tell me next time.

1370
01:49:15,422 --> 01:49:20,422
I have them, tower. Relay Hawker
to land and hold on tarmac.

1371
01:50:16,483 --> 01:50:18,860
- Secure the area!
- Wider!

1372
01:50:18,861 --> 01:50:21,320
- Armed police!
- You two, round the back!

1373
01:50:21,321 --> 01:50:24,741
Armed police!
Put your hands in the air!

1374
01:50:24,742 --> 01:50:25,575
- Three men up!
- Ready!

1375
01:50:25,576 --> 01:50:26,868
- Three men up!
- Ready!

1376
01:50:26,869 --> 01:50:29,662
Put your hands in the air! Do it now!

1377
01:50:29,663 --> 01:50:34,167
I'm afraid that's
easier said than done in my case.

1378
01:50:34,168 --> 01:50:35,668
Oh, good morning.

1379
01:50:35,669 --> 01:50:38,713
Did that old cannabis Charge
finally catch up with me?

1380
01:50:38,714 --> 01:50:41,632
Sir, the French police say
you're transporting fugitives...

1381
01:50:41,633 --> 01:50:43,593
and you may have
a hostage on board.

1382
01:50:43,594 --> 01:50:45,344
I'm to take you all into custody.

1383
01:50:45,345 --> 01:50:48,848
Sadly, I have an important medical
appointment which I can't miss.

1384
01:50:48,849 --> 01:50:50,308
I'll fetch the car, sir.

1385
01:50:50,309 --> 01:50:53,728
This is serious, sir. The French police
are on their way. Stop!

1386
01:50:53,729 --> 01:50:57,190
Inspector, I can't afford the time
to indulge your games.

1387
01:50:57,191 --> 01:50:58,733
I'm late and I'm leaving.

1388
01:50:58,734 --> 01:51:00,777
If it's so important
for you to stop us...

1389
01:51:00,778 --> 01:51:03,529
then you're just going
to have to shoot us.

1390
01:51:03,530 --> 01:51:08,530
You can start with him.

1391
01:51:10,579 --> 01:51:12,371
Search the plane.

1392
01:51:12,372 --> 01:51:17,372
All right.

1393
01:51:25,803 --> 01:51:30,803
I could run them over.

1394
01:51:32,976 --> 01:51:36,103
Bad tip.

1395
01:51:36,104 --> 01:51:41,104
Let him go.

1396
01:51:41,985 --> 01:51:46,985
The French cannot be trusted.

1397
01:51:52,996 --> 01:51:56,415
Everyone comfy?

1398
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:58,042
Biscuits?

1399
01:51:58,043 --> 01:52:00,086
They didn't notice anything?

1400
01:52:00,087 --> 01:52:05,087
Well, people rarely notice things right
in front of their eyes, don't you find?

1401
01:52:18,647 --> 01:52:21,440
<i>Do you have the bonds, bishop?</i>

1402
01:52:21,441 --> 01:52:22,859
Yes, I do, Teacher.

1403
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:26,362
<i>I have chosen an Opus Dei
residence for the exchange.</i>

1404
01:52:26,363 --> 01:52:28,072
I am honored.

1405
01:52:28,073 --> 01:52:33,073
<i>By the time you get to London,
I will have the Grail.</i>

1406
01:52:35,455 --> 01:52:38,624
- I take it the news is good, then.
- I fly to London.

1407
01:52:38,625 --> 01:52:40,835
The Teacher is waiting for me there.

1408
01:52:40,836 --> 01:52:44,630
He has chosen a house of Opus Dei
to make the exchange.

1409
01:52:44,631 --> 01:52:47,717
Mere currency
for the location of the Grail.

1410
01:52:47,718 --> 01:52:49,218
Mere currency
for the location of the Grail.

1411
01:52:49,219 --> 01:52:54,219
Imagine it.

1412
01:52:57,102 --> 01:53:02,102
Remember, if we are discovered by
the Vatican, we are excommunicated.

1413
01:53:02,316 --> 01:53:06,444
- So should anything go wrong...
- Yes, I know, I know.

1414
01:53:06,445 --> 01:53:09,113
This Council does not exist.

1415
01:53:09,114 --> 01:53:13,701
As it never has.

1416
01:53:13,702 --> 01:53:18,702
Old friend. Heaven protect you.

1417
01:53:24,963 --> 01:53:29,963
Keep an eye out for the police.

1418
01:53:40,062 --> 01:53:42,897
I must say, Robert,
I'm quite impressed...

1419
01:53:42,898 --> 01:53:47,818
by the way you withstood
my little aeroplane.

1420
01:53:47,819 --> 01:53:49,528
Did he never tell you?

1421
01:53:49,529 --> 01:53:53,032
When he was a boy,
young Robert fell into a well.

1422
01:53:53,033 --> 01:53:54,867
How old were you?

1423
01:53:54,868 --> 01:53:58,704
Seven.

1424
01:53:58,705 --> 01:54:01,999
Treading water all night long,
screaming his lungs out...

1425
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,210
to the echoes screaming back.

1426
01:54:04,211 --> 01:54:06,879
When they found him,
he was nearly catatonic.

1427
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:09,048
Help!

1428
01:54:09,049 --> 01:54:10,591
It was a long time ago.

1429
01:54:10,592 --> 01:54:12,385
Oh, now, now, Robert.

1430
01:54:12,386 --> 01:54:17,386
You above all people shouldn't be one
to dismiss the influence of the past.

1431
01:54:22,104 --> 01:54:25,606
Temple Church.
I always forget it's right here.

1432
01:54:25,607 --> 01:54:30,607
Built 1185 and modern London
just sprang up right around it.

1433
01:54:34,324 --> 01:54:34,824
Tell me, why has the Priory kept the
Grail location secret all these years?

1434
01:54:34,825 --> 01:54:38,828
Tell me, why has the Priory kept the
Grail location secret all these years?

1435
01:54:38,829 --> 01:54:40,246
I don't know.

1436
01:54:40,247 --> 01:54:43,082
Some say the Priory wait
for the heir to reveal himself...

1437
01:54:43,083 --> 01:54:44,500
which is especially odd...

1438
01:54:44,501 --> 01:54:45,042
which is especially odd...

1439
01:54:45,043 --> 01:54:50,043
since legend suggests he may not
know his own true identity.

1440
01:54:56,346 --> 01:54:58,139
Hello?

1441
01:54:58,140 --> 01:55:03,140
Why do they make them so scary?

1442
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:07,732
Oh, it's cold.

1443
01:55:07,733 --> 01:55:12,733
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1444
01:55:20,912 --> 01:55:25,912
So which tomb has an orb?

1445
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:44,060
Those knights
with their legs crossed...

1446
01:55:44,061 --> 01:55:46,312
means they'd been
to the Holy Land.

1447
01:55:46,313 --> 01:55:49,774
Two wear tunics over their armor...

1448
01:55:49,775 --> 01:55:53,986
and two have full-length robes.

1449
01:55:53,987 --> 01:55:56,155
Two are grasping swords.

1450
01:55:56,156 --> 01:56:01,156
And one... Two are praying.

1451
01:56:01,745 --> 01:56:03,913
This one has his arms at his sides.

1452
01:56:03,914 --> 01:56:07,792
Oh, and this poor fellow
has almost disappeared entirely.

1453
01:56:07,793 --> 01:56:12,793
I don't see any orb
that ought be on a tomb.

1454
01:56:13,381 --> 01:56:16,342
"Ought be on his tomb."
Are we looking for a missing orb?

1455
01:56:16,343 --> 01:56:16,843
Maybe.

1456
01:56:29,022 --> 01:56:30,773
These aren't tombs.

1457
01:56:30,774 --> 01:56:33,359
- What? Yes, of course they are.
- No.

1458
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,528
- They're effigies.
- What?

1459
01:56:35,529 --> 01:56:37,822
Not tombs. There's no bodies here.

1460
01:56:37,823 --> 01:56:41,283
This place is wrong.

1461
01:56:41,284 --> 01:56:46,284
Can we go now? We should go.

1462
01:56:47,833 --> 01:56:51,252
Sophie! No!

1463
01:56:51,253 --> 01:56:53,838
Where is the keystone?

1464
01:56:53,839 --> 01:56:55,172
Do not test me!

1465
01:56:55,173 --> 01:56:56,632
- Let her go!
- Don't hurt her.

1466
01:56:56,633 --> 01:56:58,884
Give me the keystone! Give it to me!

1467
01:56:58,885 --> 01:57:00,803
Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is.

1468
01:57:00,804 --> 01:57:05,057
Just let her go, and you and I can...
We'll come to some agreement.

1469
01:57:05,058 --> 01:57:05,558
Remy.

1470
01:57:09,855 --> 01:57:13,691
Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away.

1471
01:57:13,692 --> 01:57:17,111
Put it away. They're too close
together. You don't have a clear shot.

1472
01:57:17,112 --> 01:57:21,740
- Yes, I do.
- What do you think you're doing?

1473
01:57:21,741 --> 01:57:26,370
Thank you, professor. For a moment,
this was getting Complicated.

1474
01:57:26,371 --> 01:57:31,371
Gh, this is absurd.
Oh, for God's sake, man!

1475
01:57:31,751 --> 01:57:34,086
That was satisfying.

1476
01:57:34,087 --> 01:57:39,087
I'm glad this bullshit is over.

1477
01:57:39,176 --> 01:57:41,093
Throw Teabing in the trunk.

1478
01:57:41,094 --> 01:57:41,594
What?

1479
01:57:47,767 --> 01:57:52,767
Here. You okay?

1480
01:57:55,192 --> 01:57:55,692
Sorry.

1481
01:58:37,234 --> 01:58:42,234
I don't think he's following.

1482
01:58:47,244 --> 01:58:52,244
They won't kill Leigh
until they find the Grail.

1483
01:58:53,250 --> 01:58:58,250
- So we have to find it before they do.
- I have to get to a library, fast.

1484
01:59:04,427 --> 01:59:06,303
Lieutenant!

1485
01:59:06,304 --> 01:59:11,304
One flag off the prints.

1486
01:59:11,559 --> 01:59:13,894
Remy Legaludec.

1487
01:59:13,895 --> 01:59:17,189
Petty theft.

1488
01:59:17,190 --> 01:59:22,190
Skipped out on a hospital bill
for a tracheotomy.

1489
01:59:22,862 --> 01:59:26,115
Peanut allergy.

1490
01:59:26,116 --> 01:59:27,700
Like Marie.

1491
01:59:27,701 --> 01:59:29,952
This way. Marie?

1492
01:59:29,953 --> 01:59:32,371
My daughter.

1493
01:59:32,372 --> 01:59:37,372
Over here.

1494
01:59:40,672 --> 01:59:41,922
Where?

1495
01:59:41,923 --> 01:59:42,535
Up there.

1496
02:00:00,567 --> 02:00:02,401
What's all that?

1497
02:00:02,402 --> 02:00:07,402
Very advanced surveillance.

1498
02:00:09,492 --> 02:00:14,492
It's a listening post.

1499
02:00:20,253 --> 02:00:22,629
Get me Fache.

1500
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:27,630
Four of these names are
the men killed last night.

1501
02:00:35,685 --> 02:00:40,685
He once whined to me about the
wasted space of so large a trunk.

1502
02:00:41,107 --> 02:00:44,276
Let's see if he complains so now.

1503
02:00:44,277 --> 02:00:45,194
Are you the Teacher?

1504
02:00:45,195 --> 02:00:49,448
Are you the Teacher?

1505
02:00:49,449 --> 02:00:52,284
I am.

1506
02:00:52,285 --> 02:00:57,285
Superbly done.
You've been of great service.

1507
02:01:00,293 --> 02:01:03,295
The cryptex has yet to be opened.
I can still serve.

1508
02:01:03,296 --> 02:01:08,296
You've done enough.

1509
02:01:08,635 --> 02:01:13,472
We cannot let ego
deter us from our goal.

1510
02:01:13,473 --> 02:01:16,475
I understand.

1511
02:01:16,476 --> 02:01:16,976
Good.

1512
02:01:19,751 --> 02:01:22,231
Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei,
and you will be rewarded.

1513
02:01:22,232 --> 02:01:25,818
Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei,
and you will be rewarded.

1514
02:01:25,819 --> 02:01:29,154
I will dispose of the old man.

1515
02:01:29,155 --> 02:01:32,825
Bless you, Silas.

1516
02:01:32,826 --> 02:01:33,370
Teacher.

1517
02:01:42,293 --> 02:01:46,755
Christ be with you.

1518
02:01:46,756 --> 02:01:51,756
We're at least a half-hour
to Chelsea Library.

1519
02:01:52,178 --> 02:01:57,178
If we're gonna help Leigh,
thafstoolong.

1520
02:02:05,942 --> 02:02:07,526
Where you going?

1521
02:02:07,527 --> 02:02:12,527
Getting you a library card.

1522
02:02:13,283 --> 02:02:15,534
Excuse me. May I sit next to you?

1523
02:02:15,535 --> 02:02:20,535
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1524
02:02:26,546 --> 02:02:28,797
That's great.

1525
02:02:28,798 --> 02:02:33,719
Didn't say you had a boyfriend.

1526
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:35,637
Thanks.

1527
02:02:35,638 --> 02:02:39,141
Let's see if we can access
the database on this.

1528
02:02:39,142 --> 02:02:41,310
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1529
02:02:41,311 --> 02:02:42,728
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1530
02:02:42,729 --> 02:02:44,730
Compounding keywords:

1531
02:02:44,731 --> 02:02:48,233
Knight, Pope, Grail.

1532
02:02:48,234 --> 02:02:53,234
Your precious treasure was
almost lost, and with it, my fortune.

1533
02:02:56,618 --> 02:03:00,454
Can you believe how well I did?

1534
02:03:00,455 --> 02:03:03,457
I even convinced the monk.

1535
02:03:03,458 --> 02:03:08,458
I should be in theater.

1536
02:03:12,091 --> 02:03:17,091
A toast to our success, Teacher.
The end of the journey is near.

1537
02:03:20,141 --> 02:03:25,141
Your identity shall go
with me to the grave.

1538
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:32,945
There's your problem, mate.
It's your basic linguistic coincidence.

1539
02:03:32,946 --> 02:03:35,280
See, keywords keep coming up
with the Writings...

1540
02:03:35,281 --> 02:03:38,450
of some bloke named
Alexander Pope.

1541
02:03:38,451 --> 02:03:41,286
"A. Pope."

1542
02:03:41,287 --> 02:03:46,287
Your grandfather was a genius.

1543
02:03:47,961 --> 02:03:48,505
Come on.

1544
02:04:23,663 --> 02:04:25,581
<i>Emergency.
Which service do you require?</i>

1545
02:04:25,582 --> 02:04:30,582
I know the location of two murderers
wanted by French police.

1546
02:04:34,384 --> 02:04:35,424
We've just had a 999 call.

1547
02:04:35,425 --> 02:04:36,883
We've just had a 999 call.

1548
02:04:36,884 --> 02:04:39,428
Triangulation leads back
to Docklands.

1549
02:04:39,429 --> 02:04:41,680
Caller was male.
Claimed your two murderers...

1550
02:04:41,681 --> 02:04:46,681
are hiding at an Opus Dei house.

1551
02:04:53,443 --> 02:04:58,443
The knight we're looking for
is Sir Isaac Newton.

1552
02:04:59,073 --> 02:05:03,285
His life's work produced new Sciences
that incurred the Wrath of the Church.

1553
02:05:03,286 --> 02:05:04,453
Gravity, for God sakes.

1554
02:05:04,454 --> 02:05:06,913
Gravity, for God sakes.

1555
02:05:06,914 --> 02:05:10,208
And if you choose to believe...

1556
02:05:10,209 --> 02:05:15,209
he was also a Grand Master
of the Priory as well.

1557
02:05:25,183 --> 02:05:27,976
But if he offended
the Catholic Church...

1558
02:05:27,977 --> 02:05:31,938
the Pope would be the last person
to preside over his funeral.

1559
02:05:31,939 --> 02:05:34,358
Well, that's where I got it wrong.

1560
02:05:34,359 --> 02:05:37,444
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1561
02:05:37,445 --> 02:05:40,739
Sir Isaac Newton's funeral
was presided over...

1562
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:44,576
by his good friend,
his colleague, Alexander Pope.

1563
02:05:44,577 --> 02:05:49,456
A. Pope. His first initial.
How did I miss that?

1564
02:05:49,457 --> 02:05:50,916
Here.

1565
02:05:50,917 --> 02:05:55,170
Yes. Isaac Newton's tomb.

1566
02:05:55,171 --> 02:05:56,588
An orb.

1567
02:05:56,589 --> 02:06:01,589
Yes. Which one? It's not possible
to tell if a particular orb is missing.

1568
02:06:01,719 --> 02:06:05,430
"An orb with Rosy flesh
and seeded womb."

1569
02:06:05,431 --> 02:06:05,514
Solar system. The planets.
Constellations. Signs of the zodiac.

1570
02:06:05,515 --> 02:06:10,515
Solar system. The planets.
Constellations. Signs of the zodiac.

1571
02:06:10,603 --> 02:06:12,938
See, our moon is missing.

1572
02:06:12,939 --> 02:06:16,108
The moons of Saturn and Jupiter.
They're not here.

1573
02:06:16,109 --> 02:06:20,654
Eyes of the cherubs themselves?

1574
02:06:20,655 --> 02:06:24,449
Robert. These tracks.

1575
02:06:24,450 --> 02:06:29,450
Look at the Cane marks in the dust.

1576
02:06:29,831 --> 02:06:32,624
Teabing was here.

1577
02:06:32,625 --> 02:06:35,794
He was alone.

1578
02:06:35,795 --> 02:06:40,795
When the two of you
arrived at my home as you did...

1579
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:44,761
others might call it God's will.

1580
02:06:44,762 --> 02:06:47,639
I believed that if I had the cryptex...

1581
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:51,560
I could solve the riddle alone.

1582
02:06:51,561 --> 02:06:53,228
But I was unworthy.

1583
02:06:53,229 --> 02:06:55,313
Butyouuu.

1584
02:06:55,314 --> 02:06:57,983
You have a reason to be here.

1585
02:06:57,984 --> 02:07:01,820
You're the last remaining
guardian of the Grail.

1586
02:07:01,821 --> 02:07:04,156
Your grandfather
and the other sénéchaux...

1587
02:07:04,157 --> 02:07:06,324
would not have lied
with dying breath...

1588
02:07:06,325 --> 02:07:11,325
unless they knew
their secret was preserved.

1589
02:07:11,581 --> 02:07:14,458
How could you know
Saunière's last words?

1590
02:07:14,459 --> 02:07:16,668
Leigh.

1591
02:07:16,669 --> 02:07:19,504
Grail quests require sacrifice.

1592
02:07:19,505 --> 02:07:21,006
You are a murderer.

1593
02:07:21,007 --> 02:07:24,259
No. No. Robert, tell her.

1594
02:07:24,260 --> 02:07:29,260
When history is written,
murderers are heroes.

1595
02:07:30,183 --> 02:07:32,392
You self-righteous bastard!

1596
02:07:32,393 --> 02:07:33,894
We need to just walk away.

1597
02:07:33,895 --> 02:07:38,895
- No, don't. Don't.
- Walk away.

1598
02:07:39,025 --> 02:07:44,025
I'll do what I have to now.

1599
02:07:45,907 --> 02:07:46,519
Anything-

1600
02:07:51,204 --> 02:07:54,331
Do you understand?

1601
02:07:54,332 --> 02:07:57,209
So now...

1602
02:07:57,210 --> 02:08:00,545
can't we all be friends again?

1603
02:08:00,546 --> 02:08:01,158
This way.

1604
02:08:38,084 --> 02:08:43,084
I'm going to put this gun down.
I only want you both to listen.

1605
02:08:43,756 --> 02:08:45,590
I'm listening now.

1606
02:08:45,591 --> 02:08:47,592
For 2000 years...

1607
02:08:47,593 --> 02:08:52,305
<i>the Church has rained oppression
and atrocity upon mankind...</i>

1608
02:08:52,306 --> 02:08:57,306
<i>crushed passion and idea alike,
a/I in the name of their walking God.</i>

1609
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:02,440
Proof of Jesus' mortality can bring
an end to all that suffering...

1610
02:09:02,441 --> 02:09:04,734
drive this Church of lies
to its knees.

1611
02:09:04,735 --> 02:09:06,987
Drive this Church of lies
to its knees.

1612
02:09:06,988 --> 02:09:08,822
Armed police!

1613
02:09:08,823 --> 02:09:13,702
Drop your weapon!

1614
02:09:13,703 --> 02:09:18,703
Stop, Silas!

1615
02:09:27,550 --> 02:09:31,303
We are betrayed, my son.

1616
02:09:31,304 --> 02:09:34,389
The living heir must be revealed.

1617
02:09:34,390 --> 02:09:36,182
Jesus must be shown
for what he was.

1618
02:09:36,183 --> 02:09:36,808
Jesus must be shown
for what he was.

1619
02:09:36,809 --> 02:09:41,146
Not miraculous, simply man.

1620
02:09:41,147 --> 02:09:44,774
I'm sorry.

1621
02:09:44,775 --> 02:09:46,735
Armed police!

1622
02:09:46,736 --> 02:09:51,736
Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it!

1623
02:09:59,290 --> 02:10:04,290
Put it down now! Put it down!

1624
02:10:09,508 --> 02:10:12,719
I am a ghost.

1625
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:15,513
The dark con can be exposed.

1626
02:10:15,514 --> 02:10:20,514
Mankind can finally be set free,
and we can do it, Robert.

1627
02:10:22,104 --> 02:10:27,104
The three of us.

1628
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:43,166
How is Silas?

1629
02:10:43,167 --> 02:10:45,877
Is he...? Is he alive?

1630
02:10:45,878 --> 02:10:50,548
The monk?

1631
02:10:50,549 --> 02:10:55,053
Bishop, how would you know
this killer's name?

1632
02:10:55,054 --> 02:10:57,305
Get me out of here, Fache.

1633
02:10:57,306 --> 02:10:57,806
Wait.

1634
02:11:01,811 --> 02:11:05,563
Langdon never came to you
in confession, did he?

1635
02:11:05,564 --> 02:11:10,564
One of your followers called you
about the Crime-scene photos.

1636
02:11:10,653 --> 02:11:15,653
I cannot be implicated here. There are
still important works to be done.

1637
02:11:17,410 --> 02:11:20,578
You used me.

1638
02:11:20,579 --> 02:11:23,415
God uses us all.

1639
02:11:23,416 --> 02:11:26,126
Help me, Fache.

1640
02:11:26,127 --> 02:11:26,739
Take him.

1641
02:11:31,924 --> 02:11:33,925
- Did you get his cell phone?
- Yes, sir.

1642
02:11:33,926 --> 02:11:38,847
I'm going to need a trace.

1643
02:11:38,848 --> 02:11:43,848
Your Silas is dead.

1644
02:11:47,773 --> 02:11:49,733
The Prion/'s Sacred Charge...

1645
02:11:49,734 --> 02:11:53,778
was to reveal the heir
at the dawn of the new millennium.

1646
02:11:53,779 --> 02:11:58,779
The millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden.

1647
02:11:59,118 --> 02:12:03,788
The Priow failed
in their Sacred Charge.

1648
02:12:03,789 --> 02:12:08,789
So, what choice did I have?

1649
02:12:10,129 --> 02:12:13,381
I sought out the enemy.

1650
02:12:13,382 --> 02:12:18,344
I persuaded them, the Council
of Shadows, that I was an ally.

1651
02:12:18,345 --> 02:12:22,557
I even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me.

1652
02:12:22,558 --> 02:12:26,061
Rector, I made them call me.

1653
02:12:26,062 --> 02:12:27,270
"Teacher."

1654
02:12:27,271 --> 02:12:28,730
- Why don't you and I...
- No.

1655
02:12:28,731 --> 02:12:31,816
Robert, no words. On your knees.

1656
02:12:31,817 --> 02:12:33,526
Do it.

1657
02:12:33,527 --> 02:12:35,987
No, I mean it. Down.

1658
02:12:35,988 --> 02:12:40,988
Not you. No, my dear, you...

1659
02:12:41,452 --> 02:12:44,496
You're my miracle, Sophie.

1660
02:12:44,497 --> 02:12:47,874
You're the guardian of the Grail.

1661
02:12:47,875 --> 02:12:51,586
All the oppression of the poor
and the powerless...

1662
02:12:51,587 --> 02:12:54,672
of those of different skin,
of women.

1663
02:12:54,673 --> 02:12:58,093
You can put an end to all that.

1664
02:12:58,094 --> 02:13:02,597
You must explode the truth
onto the world.

1665
02:13:02,598 --> 02:13:07,018
It's your duty.

1666
02:13:07,019 --> 02:13:11,189
You know the answer to this riddle.

1667
02:13:11,190 --> 02:13:14,359
Open the cryptex...

1668
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:19,360
and I'll put down the gun.

1669
02:13:34,213 --> 02:13:36,381
I have no idea how.

1670
02:13:36,382 --> 02:13:38,424
I don't know the code.

1671
02:13:38,425 --> 02:13:43,425
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

1672
02:13:46,725 --> 02:13:49,769
Like your grandfather, then.

1673
02:13:49,770 --> 02:13:53,898
Willing to die for your secret.

1674
02:13:53,899 --> 02:13:57,610
But by the way you've been
looking at your hero...

1675
02:13:57,611 --> 02:14:02,611
I wonder, would you
let him die for you?

1676
02:14:02,741 --> 02:14:05,160
Open it, Sophie, to save his life.

1677
02:14:05,161 --> 02:14:07,954
- Leigh, you can't just...
- Open the cryptex.

1678
02:14:07,955 --> 02:14:09,164
I don't know how.

1679
02:14:09,165 --> 02:14:11,249
Open it or he dies.

1680
02:14:11,250 --> 02:14:13,376
- I swear, I don't know.
- Do it! Do it!

1681
02:14:13,377 --> 02:14:14,878
- Stop it!
- I don't know!

1682
02:14:14,879 --> 02:14:15,423
Stop it!

1683
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:26,760
She can't do it, Leigh.

1684
02:14:35,816 --> 02:14:40,816
But give me a moment.

1685
02:14:47,786 --> 02:14:48,286
Robert.

1686
02:15:02,593 --> 02:15:04,552
What are you doing?

1687
02:15:04,553 --> 02:15:05,053
Please.

1688
02:16:25,926 --> 02:16:30,926
I'm sorry.

1689
02:16:37,563 --> 02:16:41,649
I'm sorry.

1690
02:16:41,650 --> 02:16:42,150
No!

1691
02:16:51,118 --> 02:16:53,286
No, Robert!

1692
02:16:53,287 --> 02:16:55,455
No!

1693
02:16:55,456 --> 02:16:56,914
No.

1694
02:16:56,915 --> 02:17:01,915
Oh, the map. It's ruined.

1695
02:17:06,592 --> 02:17:08,968
The map is ruined.

1696
02:17:08,969 --> 02:17:10,928
The Grail.

1697
02:17:10,929 --> 02:17:12,764
It's lost.

1698
02:17:12,765 --> 02:17:14,599
The Grail is gone.

1699
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:18,436
Only the worthy
find the Grail, Leigh.

1700
02:17:18,437 --> 02:17:23,437
You taught me that.

1701
02:17:23,525 --> 02:17:24,817
Armed police!

1702
02:17:24,818 --> 02:17:27,445
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

1703
02:17:27,446 --> 02:17:31,616
Put the gun down.

1704
02:17:31,617 --> 02:17:36,617
Put the gun down.

1705
02:17:38,707 --> 02:17:41,626
That one. The old man.

1706
02:17:41,627 --> 02:17:42,835
You're under arrest!

1707
02:17:42,836 --> 02:17:45,254
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense...

1708
02:17:45,255 --> 02:17:47,340
if you do not mention,
when questioned...

1709
02:17:47,341 --> 02:17:49,550
something which you
later rely on in court.

1710
02:17:49,551 --> 02:17:54,551
Anything you do say
will be given in evidence.

1711
02:18:02,898 --> 02:18:07,898
I'll have some questions for you.

1712
02:18:40,602 --> 02:18:43,688
Big crowd out there now.

1713
02:18:43,689 --> 02:18:48,689
Thank you for your statements.
You are free to go, of course.

1714
02:18:56,201 --> 02:18:59,078
I'm sorry. You thought
he was your friend, no?

1715
02:18:59,079 --> 02:19:03,166
It wasn't only us, was it?

1716
02:19:03,167 --> 02:19:06,961
He used you too.

1717
02:19:06,962 --> 02:19:11,674
Leave us, please.

1718
02:19:11,675 --> 02:19:16,675
Leave us, please.

1719
02:19:24,188 --> 02:19:26,939
I should have been smarter.

1720
02:19:26,940 --> 02:19:30,193
I acted on faith, I suppose.

1721
02:19:30,194 --> 02:19:32,820
I'm sorry.

1722
02:19:32,821 --> 02:19:34,614
How many?

1723
02:19:34,615 --> 02:19:39,076
Your grandfather, the other three,
maybe more.

1724
02:19:39,077 --> 02:19:44,077
The monk was given to Teabing
as a gift, it seems.

1725
02:19:44,875 --> 02:19:47,376
To do as he asked.

1726
02:19:47,377 --> 02:19:50,796
Teabing killed the servant himself,
you know.

1727
02:19:50,797 --> 02:19:53,799
- Remy?
- Yes.

1728
02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:57,637
By poison.

1729
02:19:57,638 --> 02:20:01,224
How much of it
have you been able to figure out?

1730
02:20:01,225 --> 02:20:06,187
Some. Not enough for it
to make sense.

1731
02:20:06,188 --> 02:20:11,188
It won't ever make sense.

1732
02:20:19,159 --> 02:20:24,159
I'm sorry.

1733
02:20:35,300 --> 02:20:39,053
He forgot everything we've learned.

1734
02:20:39,054 --> 02:20:44,054
Everything we teach.

1735
02:20:44,309 --> 02:20:47,853
It's why we study history.

1736
02:20:47,854 --> 02:20:52,854
So we'll stop killing each other.

1737
02:21:13,005 --> 02:21:16,882
Robert! Robert! Robert!
How could you do it?

1738
02:21:16,883 --> 02:21:19,510
How could you? Robert!

1739
02:21:19,511 --> 02:21:21,137
To destroy our hope of freedom.

1740
02:21:21,138 --> 02:21:22,179
To destroy our hope of freedom.

1741
02:21:22,180 --> 02:21:25,683
To deny every pilgrim the Chance
to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.

1742
02:21:25,684 --> 02:21:30,684
How could you?

1743
02:21:31,648 --> 02:21:36,027
You couldn't! You solved it.

1744
02:21:36,028 --> 02:21:39,697
You took the scroll out
before it broke!

1745
02:21:39,698 --> 02:21:43,868
You solved it. Oh, you'll find it, Robert.
You'll find it. You know what to do.

1746
02:21:43,869 --> 02:21:46,329
You'll find the Grail,
you'll kneel before her...

1747
02:21:46,330 --> 02:21:48,539
and you'll set her free
upon the world!

1748
02:21:48,540 --> 02:21:53,540
That man there,
he's got the map to the Holy Grail!

1749
02:22:02,471 --> 02:22:07,471
There was every orb conceivable
on that tomb except one:

1750
02:22:08,310 --> 02:22:12,688
The orb which fell from the heavens
and inspired Newton's life's work.

1751
02:22:12,689 --> 02:22:17,689
Work that incurred the wrath
of the Church until his dying day.

1752
02:22:20,822 --> 02:22:23,407
A-P-P-L-E.

1753
02:22:23,408 --> 02:22:23,908
Apple.

1754
02:22:39,216 --> 02:22:42,385
<i>The Holy Grai/ 'neath
ancient Roslin Waits.</i>

1755
02:22:42,386 --> 02:22:44,929
<i>The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates.</i>

1756
02:22:44,930 --> 02:22:47,223
<i>Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies.</i>

1757
02:22:47,224 --> 02:22:52,224
<i>She rests at last
beneath the starry skies</i>

1758
02:22:52,729 --> 02:22:55,564
I think I know where she's gone.

1759
02:22:55,565 --> 02:23:00,565
I think the Grail has gone home.

1760
02:23:17,963 --> 02:23:22,963
Built by the Templars themselves.
Named for the original Rose Line.

1761
02:23:22,968 --> 02:23:25,970
Rosslyn Chapel.

1762
02:23:25,971 --> 02:23:28,764
So this is it.

1763
02:23:28,765 --> 02:23:31,600
The gift at the end.

1764
02:23:31,601 --> 02:23:36,272
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits."

1765
02:23:36,273 --> 02:23:39,775
You never told me the joke
Saunière made of you.

1766
02:23:39,776 --> 02:23:41,610
What was it?

1767
02:23:41,611 --> 02:23:43,821
He called me a flatfoot.

1768
02:23:43,822 --> 02:23:46,824
A beat COp of history.

1769
02:23:46,825 --> 02:23:49,076
Oh, a dumb policeman...

1770
02:23:49,077 --> 02:23:52,663
who just does his job
day after day, of history.

1771
02:23:52,664 --> 02:23:57,084
You know, his father was one.
A policeman.

1772
02:23:57,085 --> 02:24:02,085
Saunière said he was the most
honorable man he had ever known.

1773
02:24:05,677 --> 02:24:09,305
We are who we protect, I think.

1774
02:24:09,306 --> 02:24:14,306
What we stand up for.

1775
02:24:22,944 --> 02:24:25,446
Jewish...

1776
02:24:25,447 --> 02:24:29,492
Christian, Egyptian...

1777
02:24:29,493 --> 02:24:32,953
Masonic, pagan...

1778
02:24:32,954 --> 02:24:35,289
Templar crosses...

1779
02:24:35,290 --> 02:24:40,290
n-Pyramids.

1780
02:24:44,424 --> 02:24:48,385
I think I've been here before.

1781
02:24:48,386 --> 02:24:48,886
<i>Sophie.</i>

1782
02:25:09,407 --> 02:25:13,494
A very long time ago.

1783
02:25:13,495 --> 02:25:18,495
Come along, Sophie.

1784
02:25:30,512 --> 02:25:32,596
Sophie.

1785
02:25:32,597 --> 02:25:37,597
Over here.

1786
02:25:41,481 --> 02:25:45,442
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates."

1787
02:25:45,443 --> 02:25:49,905
Pagan symbols for
male and female.

1788
02:25:49,906 --> 02:25:52,116
Fused as one.

1789
02:25:52,117 --> 02:25:55,828
As the pagans would have wanted.

1790
02:25:55,829 --> 02:26:00,829
We're about to close, I'm afraid.

1791
02:26:03,795 --> 02:26:08,795
We're just gonna be a moment.

1792
02:26:55,347 --> 02:26:55,847
Robert.

1793
02:27:29,881 --> 02:27:34,881
I've never seen that before.

1794
02:27:36,930 --> 02:27:40,766
The style is...

1795
02:27:40,767 --> 02:27:45,767
It's unmistakable.

1796
02:27:51,611 --> 02:27:56,031
These could have been painted by
Leonardo da Vinci.

1797
02:27:56,032 --> 02:27:59,702
"Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies."

1798
02:27:59,703 --> 02:28:04,248
"She rests at last
beneath the starry skies."

1799
02:28:04,249 --> 02:28:09,249
"She rests at last
beneath the starry skies."

1800
02:28:24,269 --> 02:28:29,269
The fleur-de-lis.

1801
02:29:17,072 --> 02:29:21,158
She was here.

1802
02:29:21,159 --> 02:29:24,870
Her sarcophagus.

1803
02:29:24,871 --> 02:29:28,165
Mary Magdalene.

1804
02:29:28,166 --> 02:29:31,794
The Holy Grail herself.

1805
02:29:31,795 --> 02:29:36,795
She was here.

1806
02:29:40,553 --> 02:29:44,932
With modern DNA testing,
those bones...

1807
02:29:44,933 --> 02:29:49,933
could have shown definitive proof
of a bloodline.

1808
02:29:50,647 --> 02:29:53,315
Where did she go?

1809
02:29:53,316 --> 02:29:58,316
Did the Church finally get her?

1810
02:30:10,250 --> 02:30:13,001
This is incredible. Look at this.

1811
02:30:13,002 --> 02:30:17,548
Look at this. These records
go back thousands of years.

1812
02:30:17,549 --> 02:30:22,549
They date back
to the death of Christ.

1813
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:27,720
Good God, could these
really be the Grail documents?

1814
02:30:48,121 --> 02:30:53,121
What did he want from us?
To find her sarcophagus?

1815
02:30:53,418 --> 02:30:56,545
How was I ever supposed
to figure all this out?

1816
02:30:56,546 --> 02:30:59,131
When you and your
grandfather fought...

1817
02:30:59,132 --> 02:31:03,677
was it something about your past?

1818
02:31:03,678 --> 02:31:06,138
How could you know that?

1819
02:31:06,139 --> 02:31:09,892
About how your parents died?

1820
02:31:09,893 --> 02:31:13,812
Sophie?

1821
02:31:13,813 --> 02:31:17,649
It was during primary school.

1822
02:31:17,650 --> 02:31:21,445
I was in his library.

1823
02:31:21,446 --> 02:31:23,155
Doing research.

1824
02:31:23,156 --> 02:31:25,991
<i>I was trying to find out
about my family.</i>

1825
02:31:25,992 --> 02:31:29,077
Sophie, where are you, princess?

1826
02:31:29,078 --> 02:31:32,080
I wanted to know about them.

1827
02:31:32,081 --> 02:31:35,250
But I couldn't find any records.

1828
02:31:35,251 --> 02:31:38,629
Not of their death...

1829
02:31:38,630 --> 02:31:41,131
not of the accident.

1830
02:31:41,132 --> 02:31:43,675
<i>I'd asked him for as long
as I could remember...</i>

1831
02:31:43,676 --> 02:31:45,177
<i>but he would never tell me.</i>

1832
02:31:45,178 --> 02:31:49,306
I told you, no.

1833
02:31:49,307 --> 02:31:51,141
But why can't I?

1834
02:31:51,142 --> 02:31:54,686
He stood over me...

1835
02:31:54,687 --> 02:31:56,939
and he wouldn't let me leave.

1836
02:31:56,940 --> 02:31:59,274
They're dead. Dead and buried.

1837
02:31:59,275 --> 02:32:01,193
Never look for them, Sophie.

1838
02:32:01,194 --> 02:32:03,862
Promise me.

1839
02:32:03,863 --> 02:32:05,697
Swear it!

1840
02:32:05,698 --> 02:32:10,698
Swear it to me!

1841
02:32:17,502 --> 02:32:22,502
I kept my promise.

1842
02:32:23,091 --> 02:32:27,594
The next week he sent me
to boarding school.

1843
02:32:27,595 --> 02:32:32,099
<i>One weekend
I came home unexpectedly.</i>

1844
02:32:32,100 --> 02:32:35,852
<i>And what I saw
my grandfather doing..</i> ..

1845
02:32:35,853 --> 02:32:39,523
<i>Some ritual.</i>

1846
02:32:39,524 --> 02:32:44,524
<i>I was so frightened.</i>

1847
02:32:45,780 --> 02:32:50,780
We hardly ever spoke again.

1848
02:32:51,703 --> 02:32:56,703
Do you have any memories of your
grandfather before the acoident?

1849
02:32:57,792 --> 02:33:00,711
Before your parents were killed?

1850
02:33:00,712 --> 02:33:04,423
Yeah. No. I don't know.

1851
02:33:04,424 --> 02:33:08,302
Why?

1852
02:33:08,303 --> 02:33:13,303
Because I don't think
he was your grandfather.

1853
02:33:30,158 --> 02:33:34,286
These are my parents.

1854
02:33:34,287 --> 02:33:37,331
My brother.

1855
02:33:37,332 --> 02:33:42,332
And this is you, isn't it?

1856
02:33:44,088 --> 02:33:48,258
The paper says
the entire family was killed.

1857
02:33:48,259 --> 02:33:53,259
The mother, the father, the boy, 6...

1858
02:33:53,931 --> 02:33:57,851
and the girl, 4.

1859
02:33:57,852 --> 02:34:02,852
But your name was never Saunière.
It's Saint-Clair.

1860
02:34:05,860 --> 02:34:08,862
It's one of the oldest families
in France.

1861
02:34:08,863 --> 02:34:13,863
It's from a line of the
Merovingian kings.

1862
02:34:21,209 --> 02:34:25,045
Royal blood.

1863
02:34:25,046 --> 02:34:28,298
I was so wrong.

1864
02:34:28,299 --> 02:34:33,299
Saunière didn't want you to help guard
the secret of the Holy Grail.

1865
02:34:34,305 --> 02:34:35,555
Sophie...

1866
02:34:35,556 --> 02:34:38,141
Sophie...

1867
02:34:38,142 --> 02:34:41,645
you are the secret.

1868
02:34:41,646 --> 02:34:44,398
You survived the accident.

1869
02:34:44,399 --> 02:34:47,234
If it even was an accident.

1870
02:34:47,235 --> 02:34:49,820
The Priow found out.

1871
02:34:49,821 --> 02:34:53,573
Somehow they concealed
the fact that you were alive.

1872
02:34:53,574 --> 02:34:57,411
They hid you with the
Grand Master himself...

1873
02:34:57,412 --> 02:35:00,664
who raised you as his own.

1874
02:35:00,665 --> 02:35:04,000
According to all of this...

1875
02:35:04,001 --> 02:35:09,001
Princess Sophie...

1876
02:35:09,382 --> 02:35:13,176
you are the heir.

1877
02:35:13,177 --> 02:35:16,721
The end of the bloodline.

1878
02:35:16,722 --> 02:35:21,184
You are the last living descendent...

1879
02:35:21,185 --> 02:35:26,185
of Jesus Christ.

1880
02:36:08,483 --> 02:36:11,902
What is this?

1881
02:36:11,903 --> 02:36:12,403
Sophie?

1882
02:36:16,324 --> 02:36:17,616
Who are you?

1883
02:36:17,617 --> 02:36:20,619
There have been many names.

1884
02:36:20,620 --> 02:36:23,288
The keepers.

1885
02:36:23,289 --> 02:36:25,165
Guardians.

1886
02:36:25,166 --> 02:36:27,792
The Priow of Sion.

1887
02:36:27,793 --> 02:36:32,793
But to you, Sophie, we are friends
of the man who raised you:

1888
02:36:33,591 --> 02:36:37,594
Jacques Saunière.

1889
02:36:37,595 --> 02:36:42,595
He would have wanted you to know
that he loved you very much.

1890
02:36:43,851 --> 02:36:48,021
And that the Priory are here
to protect you now...

1891
02:36:48,022 --> 02:36:53,022
as they have always
protected our family.

1892
02:36:53,778 --> 02:36:56,655
I gave you up once...

1893
02:36:56,656 --> 02:37:01,656
knowing I might
never see you again.

1894
02:37:03,162 --> 02:37:06,289
I'm your grandmother, Sophie.

1895
02:37:06,290 --> 02:37:11,290
I have prayed for this moment
for a very long time.

1896
02:37:13,297 --> 02:37:18,297
Welcome home, child.

1897
02:37:39,490 --> 02:37:43,034
Hey.

1898
02:37:43,035 --> 02:37:48,035
No more strings.

1899
02:37:49,166 --> 02:37:54,166
His last breath to keep me safe.

1900
02:37:56,882 --> 02:38:01,882
She has some things
she wants to tell me.

1901
02:38:01,887 --> 02:38:06,887
About my family.

1902
02:38:10,646 --> 02:38:12,897
What will you do?

1903
02:38:12,898 --> 02:38:17,444
The legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself.

1904
02:38:17,445 --> 02:38:22,445
They just got the pronoun wrong.

1905
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:25,118
She said when Saunière died...

1906
02:38:25,119 --> 02:38:29,080
he took the location
of Mary's sarcophagus with him.

1907
02:38:29,081 --> 02:38:34,081
So there's no way to empirically prove
that I am related to her.

1908
02:38:35,212 --> 02:38:38,089
What would you do, Robert?

1909
02:38:38,090 --> 02:38:42,552
Okay, maybe there is no proof.
Maybe the Grail is lost forever.

1910
02:38:42,553 --> 02:38:47,553
But, Sophie, the only thing that
matters is what you believe.

1911
02:38:47,767 --> 02:38:51,019
History shows us
Jesus was an extraordinary man...

1912
02:38:51,020 --> 02:38:53,813
a human inspiration. That's it.

1913
02:38:53,814 --> 02:38:58,068
That's all the evidence
has ever proved.

1914
02:38:58,069 --> 02:39:00,111
But...

1915
02:39:00,112 --> 02:39:04,407
when I was a boy...

1916
02:39:04,408 --> 02:39:09,408
When I was down in that well
Teabing told you about...

1917
02:39:11,457 --> 02:39:16,211
I thought I was going to die,
Sophie.

1918
02:39:16,212 --> 02:39:18,380
What I did...

1919
02:39:18,381 --> 02:39:21,257
I prayed.

1920
02:39:21,258 --> 02:39:25,553
I prayed to Jesus to keep me alive...

1921
02:39:25,554 --> 02:39:27,472
so I could see my parents again...

1922
02:39:27,473 --> 02:39:30,475
so I could go to school again...

1923
02:39:30,476 --> 02:39:34,145
so I could play with my dog.

1924
02:39:34,146 --> 02:39:39,146
Sometimes I wonder
if I wasn't alone down there.

1925
02:39:39,360 --> 02:39:42,278
Why does it have to be
human or divine?

1926
02:39:42,279 --> 02:39:45,490
Maybe human is divine.

1927
02:39:45,491 --> 02:39:47,325
Why couldn't Jesus
have been a father...

1928
02:39:47,326 --> 02:39:47,534
Why couldn't Jesus
have been a father...

1929
02:39:47,535 --> 02:39:50,787
and still been capable
of all those miracles?

1930
02:39:50,788 --> 02:39:53,707
Like turning water into wine?

1931
02:39:53,708 --> 02:39:57,502
Well, who knows?
His blood is your blood.

1932
02:39:57,503 --> 02:40:01,256
Maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again.

1933
02:40:01,257 --> 02:40:04,467
Maybe you healed my phobia
with your hands.

1934
02:40:04,468 --> 02:40:09,468
And maybe you're
a knight on a Grail quest.

1935
02:40:10,307 --> 02:40:13,810
Well, here's the question:

1936
02:40:13,811 --> 02:40:18,022
A living descendent
of Jesus Christ...

1937
02:40:18,023 --> 02:40:21,109
would she destroy faith?

1938
02:40:21,110 --> 02:40:22,235
Or would she renew it?

1939
02:40:22,236 --> 02:40:26,614
Or would she renew it?

1940
02:40:26,615 --> 02:40:31,615
So again I say, what matters
is what you believe.

1941
02:40:32,121 --> 02:40:35,540
Thank you.

1942
02:40:35,541 --> 02:40:39,002
For bringing me here.

1943
02:40:39,003 --> 02:40:42,172
For letting him choose you...

1944
02:40:42,173 --> 02:40:47,173
Sir Robert.

1945
02:40:53,642 --> 02:40:56,227
You take care.

1946
02:40:56,228 --> 02:40:56,728
Yes.

1947
02:41:22,046 --> 02:41:22,546
Hey.

1948
02:41:36,143 --> 02:41:38,436
Nope.

1949
02:41:38,437 --> 02:41:43,437
Maybe I'll do better with the wine.

1950
02:41:44,235 --> 02:41:44,847
Godspeed.

1951
02:42:44,378 --> 02:42:49,215
Bloodline.

1952
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:49,716
Rose Line.

1953
02:42:49,717 --> 02:42:54,717
Rose Line.

1954
02:42:56,724 --> 02:42:57,724
"Hides beneath the Rose."

1955
02:42:57,725 --> 02:43:02,725
"Hides beneath the Rose."

1956
02:44:57,970 --> 02:45:02,970
<i>"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin Waits."</i>

1957
02:45:04,643 --> 02:45:09,643
<i>Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies.</i>

1958
02:45:24,121 --> 02:45:29,121
<i>The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates.</i>

1959
02:46:07,247 --> 02:46:12,247
"<i>She rests at last
beneath starry skies.</i>"

1960
02:46:12,990 --> 02:46:31,590
