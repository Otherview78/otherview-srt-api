1
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:04,626
- Did that kill it? - No.

2
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,919
That's how we kill it.

3
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:12,217
The Book of Vishanti!

4
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:17,240
We can't let it take your power.

5
00:01:17,264 --> 00:01:18,265
Get to the book.

6
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:20,434
- How do we get across? - Jump.

7
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:24,771
Hold on!

8
00:01:26,982 --> 00:01:29,109
No, no, no!

9
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,609
It's too strong.

10
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:12,319
I can't hold it.

11
00:02:38,512 --> 00:02:39,513
I'm so sorry.

12
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:41,348
This is the only way.

13
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:45,560
What're you doing?

14
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:47,604
I can't let that thing take your power.

15
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:49,648
You can't control it.

16
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:52,192
But I can.

17
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:54,027
But we're friends.

18
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,571
You're killing me.

19
00:02:56,655 --> 00:02:57,739
I know.

20
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:01,785
But in the grand calculus of the Multiverse,

21
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:03,912
your sacrifice is worth more than your...

22
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:30,248
Excuse me. May I?

23
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:31,416
Thanks.

24
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:53,063
Doctor Strange.

25
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:54,314
Doctor West.

26
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:57,275
Haven't seen you in a while.

27
00:04:57,442 --> 00:05:01,488
Yeah, I was a little preoccupied being dust there for five years, so...

28
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:03,156
So were a lot of us.

29
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:07,577
While I was gone,

30
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,913
thank you for asking,

31
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:12,749
I lost both my cats...

32
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:17,295
and my brother.

33
00:05:20,549 --> 00:05:22,008
I'm very sorry.

34
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:24,302
Thank you.

35
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,931
I, uh...

36
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:32,978
I guess what keeps me up at night is wondering,

37
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,730
did it have to happen that way?

38
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:39,818
Was there any other path?

39
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:44,698
No.

40
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:48,743
No, I made the only play we had.

41
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,870
Well, of course you did.

42
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,624
The best surgeon and the best superhero.

43
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,714
But you still didn't get the girl.

44
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:51,222
Glass of red, please.

45
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:53,308
- Oh, allow me, miss. - Mm.

46
00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:56,394
- Ah. - Little too on the nose?

47
00:06:56,561 --> 00:06:58,229
What? For you, at my wedding?

48
00:06:58,396 --> 00:07:00,482
Nah. I think it was perfect.

49
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:01,900
Congratulations.

50
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:03,234
Thank you.

51
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:05,195
Mm. There's Charlie.

52
00:07:05,362 --> 00:07:07,572
I have to introduce you because he's kind of...

53
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:10,825
It's embarrassing, but he's a big fan, so...

54
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:12,452
Hey, uh, Christine. Um...

55
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,080
I should've...

56
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:19,197
I wish I'd have been different.

57
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:22,212
I never stopped caring about us.

58
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:24,464
But I had to make sacrifices

59
00:07:25,256 --> 00:07:26,758
to protect you.

60
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:28,468
I'm sorry.

61
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:34,974
It was never gonna work out between us.

62
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,645
Why not?

63
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:40,647
Because, Stephen,

64
00:07:40,814 --> 00:07:43,108
you have to be the one holding the knife.

65
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:45,360
And I always respected you for it,

66
00:07:45,443 --> 00:07:47,237
but I couldn't love you for it.

67
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:53,868
How long you had that one in the barrel?

68
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:57,372
Long time.

69
00:07:57,455 --> 00:07:59,374
Yeah. I bet.

70
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,542
Look, um...

71
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,754
Truly, I'm just glad that you're happy.

72
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:05,964
Mm.

73
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,091
I am.

74
00:08:09,217 --> 00:08:10,343
I really, really am.

75
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:11,886
Good.

76
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:13,972
Are you?

77
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:15,932
I'm happy.

78
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:17,517
Good.

79
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:19,310
You deserve it.

80
00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:30,947
Oh, man. Look out! What is that?

81
00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:33,950
Dude!

82
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:42,664
Thank you.

83
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:24,542
Wow!

84
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,382
No, no.

85
00:09:44,813 --> 00:09:46,314
Look out!

86
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:58,368
Do I know you?

87
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:42,513
Help!

88
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:50,229
You're welcome.

89
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:52,106
You know it's ancient custom

90
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,275
to bow in the presence of the Sorcerer Supreme?

91
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:56,444
Yeah, I'm aware of the customs.

92
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:04,869
Hold it, hold it! Whoa!

93
00:12:28,685 --> 00:12:29,811
Whoa.

94
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:31,437
That's incredible.

95
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:32,855
Yeah.

96
00:12:37,986 --> 00:12:39,195
Oh, God!

97
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:35,877
Who's this?

98
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,271
Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question.

99
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:38,629
Hey, kid.

100
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:40,214
What did that creature want with you?

101
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:41,382
Where're your parents?

102
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:42,826
We'll take her back to the Sanc...

103
00:13:46,095 --> 00:13:47,180
She took my Slingie.

104
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:48,931
She took your Slingie.

105
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:55,688
Yeah, it was crazy, man.

106
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:56,939
Oh, my God!

107
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:00,318
I'm not gonna kill you, kid.

108
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:02,987
I just bust my ass trying to save your life, remember?

109
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:07,408
Giant monsters I can clearly handle,

110
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:10,745
but what bothers me is that last night, you were in my dream.

111
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:14,457
That wasn't a dream.

112
00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:16,501
It was another universe.

113
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:21,994
How much experience do you guys have with the Multiverse?

114
00:14:22,465 --> 00:14:23,945
We have experience of the Multiverse.

115
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:26,094
Most recently, there was an incident with Spider-Man.

116
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:27,470
What man?

117
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:29,764
Spider-Man. He has the powers of a spider.

118
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:31,891
- Hence the name. - Gross.

119
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:34,174
- Does he look like a spider? - No. No, more like a man.

120
00:14:34,227 --> 00:14:35,353
Climbs walls, shoots webs.

121
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:36,955
- Yeah. Bingo. - Out of his butt?

122
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:38,231
- No. - No.

123
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:39,732
Well, maybe, I don't know.

124
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:40,942
Honestly, I hope not.

125
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:42,110
Super weird.

126
00:14:43,861 --> 00:14:45,196
You're gonna get a stomach ache.

127
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,906
I'm from another universe.

128
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:48,801
How do you know my stomach works the same as yours?

129
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:50,034
I don't.

130
00:14:50,326 --> 00:14:52,537
I don't even know if you're from another universe,

131
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,640
which is why I'm still sitting here, waiting for you

132
00:14:54,664 --> 00:14:55,891
to enlighten us.

133
00:14:55,915 --> 00:14:56,916
Gotta say,

134
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,260
of the two Doctor Stranges I've met so far...

135
00:14:59,752 --> 00:15:00,813
...you're not my favourite.

136
00:15:00,837 --> 00:15:02,564
Which means?

137
00:15:03,673 --> 00:15:05,049
Does he not know Spanish?

138
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:07,927
I'm not sure he even enjoys speaking English.

139
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:10,697
Look, I left a very nice wedding

140
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:13,558
to save a smart-ass kid from getting eaten by an octopus.

141
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:14,701
- Whose wedding? - Now tell me...

142
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:15,768
- Christine's. - You went?

143
00:15:15,852 --> 00:15:16,995
Holy shit, you married Christine?

144
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,059
- Do you mind? - Yes, I do.

145
00:15:18,104 --> 00:15:19,272
No, I didn't. Yes.

146
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:21,524
You need to explain to me what's going on.

147
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:23,776
Why was that octopus trying to eat you?

148
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,736
That thing was trying to kidnap me.

149
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:29,157
It's like a henchman who works for a demon.

150
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,118
All we knew is that they wanted to take my power for themselves.

151
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:33,369
What power?

152
00:15:34,954 --> 00:15:36,414
I can travel the Multiverse.

153
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:37,999
What?

154
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:40,376
You can physically move from one universe to another?

155
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:41,627
- Mm-hmm. - How?

156
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:43,671
That's the problem. I don't know how.

157
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:45,089
Can't control it.

158
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:47,258
Only happens when I'm really, really afraid.

159
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,554
Okay. And did Other Me know how to defeat this demon?

160
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:52,889
Well, you guys knew

161
00:15:52,972 --> 00:15:54,724
of this magical book of pure good

162
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:57,935
that gives a sorcerer whatever they need to defeat their enemy.

163
00:15:58,436 --> 00:16:00,146
The Book of Vishanti?

164
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:01,731
It's not real.

165
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:04,192
It's a fairy tale. It doesn't exist.

166
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:05,359
Actually, it does.

167
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:09,047
I found out in the secret book you get when you become Sorcerer Supreme.

168
00:16:09,071 --> 00:16:10,281
Unbelievable.

169
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:11,699
You're not the Sorcerer Supreme?

170
00:16:11,782 --> 00:16:13,534
No, I'm not the Sorcerer Supreme.

171
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:15,345
Other You was Sorcerer Supreme of his universe.

172
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:16,471
Right. Yeah.

173
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:18,122
Although it does exist,

174
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:20,541
The Book of Vishanti is said to be unreachable.

175
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:22,960
It is. Except...

176
00:16:24,128 --> 00:16:25,129
we reached it.

177
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:28,883
Then the demon caught up with us.

178
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:31,719
I thought you'd protect me...

179
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,640
but you didn't.

180
00:16:35,723 --> 00:16:37,225
That was the fight in my dream.

181
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:40,144
That wasn't a dream.

182
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:42,188
Prove it.

183
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:51,989
It wasn't a dream.

184
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:00,498
That means...

185
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,086
dreams are windows into the lives of our Multiversal selves.

186
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:08,965
That was his theory.

187
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:12,009
So, that recurring nightmare where I'm running naked from a clown...

188
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,637
Somewhere out there, it's real.

189
00:17:15,221 --> 00:17:17,556
Somewhere out there I had a ponytail.

190
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,185
There could be more creatures coming for her.

191
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:23,562
The power is dangerous enough in the hands of a kid.

192
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:25,126
Imagine if a real threat acquired it?

193
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,111
It occurs to me, young one, we don't know your name.

194
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:34,824
America Chavez.

195
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:38,119
Miss Chavez, will you come with us to Kamar-Taj?

196
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:39,495
You'll be safe there.

197
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:42,373
How do I know you won't betray me like he did?

198
00:17:43,499 --> 00:17:45,501
I guess you're just gonna have to trust me.

199
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:50,798
What do we do with him?

200
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:01,017
That's gotta violate an ordinance.

201
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,643
Ah, I've buried worse.

202
00:18:05,563 --> 00:18:07,106
The creature that killed him, did...

203
00:18:07,857 --> 00:18:09,859
did it have the same markings as the octopus?

204
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:11,068
Runes.

205
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:13,362
This isn't sorcery.

206
00:18:14,697 --> 00:18:15,698
It's witchcraft.

207
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:18,701
Do we know anyone who's faced such a thing?

208
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:22,872
I think I might.

209
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,127
- Chocolate! - Hey! What did I say?

210
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,337
But we couldn't wait.

211
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,671
But what did I say?

212
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:33,382
Oh!

213
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,177
Go wash your hands.

214
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:42,975
Mom, come on. We're too old for that.

215
00:18:43,142 --> 00:18:45,311
Oh, okay.

216
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:46,562
You can tuck me in, Mom.

217
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:48,397
I will.

218
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:55,446
You know, a family is forever.

219
00:18:56,322 --> 00:18:59,408
We could never truly leave each other, even if we tried.

220
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:01,494
Mom, I changed my mind.

221
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,746
You can come tuck me in if you want.

222
00:19:03,913 --> 00:19:05,081
Okay.

223
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:10,294
Love you.

224
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,660
Apples, right?

225
00:19:43,994 --> 00:19:45,371
- Eventually. - Hmm.

226
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:53,462
- Smells... - Sweet.

227
00:19:54,004 --> 00:19:55,589
I was gonna say real.

228
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,259
Oh, it's all very real, thanks.

229
00:19:59,593 --> 00:20:01,303
I've put the magic behind me.

230
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:02,596
So I can see.

231
00:20:03,305 --> 00:20:05,850
Well, I knew sooner or later you'd show up,

232
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:08,018
wanting to discuss what happened at Westview.

233
00:20:09,937 --> 00:20:12,898
I made mistakes, and people were hurt...

234
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:16,735
But you put things right in the end, and that was never in doubt.

235
00:20:16,902 --> 00:20:19,780
I'm not here to talk about Westview.

236
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:21,049
Then what are you here for?

237
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:22,324
We need your help.

238
00:20:25,202 --> 00:20:26,370
With what?

239
00:20:26,537 --> 00:20:28,539
What do you know about the Multiverse?

240
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:30,332
The Multiverse.

241
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:31,584
Vis had his theories.

242
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:35,671
He believed it was real, and dangerous.

243
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:37,339
Well, he was right about both.

244
00:20:37,923 --> 00:20:40,718
We found a girl who can somehow travel across it,

245
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:42,344
but she's being pursued.

246
00:20:42,428 --> 00:20:44,054
- Pursued by who? - Some kind of demon.

247
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:46,140
- One that covets her power for itself. - Ah.

248
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:50,644
We've taken her to Kamar-Taj, and we've got our defences,

249
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:52,521
but we could use an Avenger.

250
00:20:52,688 --> 00:20:54,398
There are other Avengers.

251
00:20:54,482 --> 00:20:57,151
Yeah, but given the choice between the archer with the mohawk

252
00:20:57,234 --> 00:20:59,403
and several bug-themed crime fighters,

253
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:04,408
or one of the most powerful magic-wielders on the planet...

254
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:05,910
...it's an easy call.

255
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,162
Come to Kamar-Taj.

256
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:11,540
It'll get you back on the lunch box.

257
00:21:14,543 --> 00:21:16,670
What if you brought America here?

258
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:18,756
Here?

259
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,176
Yeah. I know what it's like to be on your own,

260
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:24,845
hunted for abilities you never wanted,

261
00:21:25,804 --> 00:21:27,431
and I can protect her.

262
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:34,956
You never told me her name, did you?

263
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,023
No.

264
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:38,817
- Mm. - No, I didn't.

265
00:21:43,656 --> 00:21:45,616
You know, the Hex was the easy part.

266
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:49,328
The lying, not so much.

267
00:22:16,397 --> 00:22:17,481
The Darkhold.

268
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:19,024
You're familiar with the Darkhold?

269
00:22:19,191 --> 00:22:21,026
I know it's the Book of the Damned,

270
00:22:21,193 --> 00:22:24,613
and that it corrupts everything and everyone that it touches.

271
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,407
I wonder what it's done to you.

272
00:22:26,574 --> 00:22:28,951
The Darkhold only showed me the truth.

273
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:32,746
Everything I lost can be mine again.

274
00:22:32,913 --> 00:22:34,456
What do you want with America?

275
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,500
What do you want with the Multiverse?

276
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,961
I'm going to leave this reality

277
00:22:39,753 --> 00:22:42,214
and go to one where I can be with my children.

278
00:22:42,381 --> 00:22:44,675
Wanda, your children aren't real.

279
00:22:44,842 --> 00:22:46,885
You created them using magic.

280
00:22:47,052 --> 00:22:48,679
That's what every mother does.

281
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:53,225
If you knew

282
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:56,228
there was a universe

283
00:22:56,395 --> 00:22:58,105
where you were happy,

284
00:22:58,272 --> 00:23:00,232
wouldn't you want to go there?

285
00:23:00,691 --> 00:23:02,234
I am happy.

286
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:05,154
I know better than most what self-deception looks like.

287
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,491
What you're doing is a flagrant violation of every natural law,

288
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:11,368
and if you take that child's power,

289
00:23:11,452 --> 00:23:12,453
she won't survive.

290
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,747
I don't relish hurting anyone, Stephen.

291
00:23:15,581 --> 00:23:17,082
But she's not a child.

292
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:19,418
She's a supernatural being.

293
00:23:19,585 --> 00:23:22,171
Such raw power could wreak havoc on this

294
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:23,464
and other worlds.

295
00:23:23,631 --> 00:23:25,049
Her sacrifice

296
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:27,343
would be for the greater good.

297
00:23:27,426 --> 00:23:29,026
Well, you can kiss the lunch box goodbye,

298
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:31,805
'cause that's the kind of justification our enemies use.

299
00:23:31,889 --> 00:23:33,390
Is it the one you used

300
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:36,477
when you gave Thanos the Time Stone?

301
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,692
That was a war, and I did what I had to do.

302
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:46,153
You break the rules and become a hero.

303
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,238
I do it, and I become the enemy.

304
00:23:49,573 --> 00:23:51,158
That doesn't seem fair.

305
00:23:52,785 --> 00:23:54,203
What happens now?

306
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:55,996
Return to Kamar-Taj

307
00:23:56,163 --> 00:23:59,291
and prepare to hand over America Chavez by sundown.

308
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:01,627
Peacefully.

309
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:04,046
After that...

310
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,509
You'll never see me again.

311
00:24:12,304 --> 00:24:13,806
And if we don't?

312
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,604
Then it won't be Wanda who comes for her.

313
00:24:21,814 --> 00:24:23,816
It will be the Scarlet Witch.

314
00:24:34,326 --> 00:24:35,953
The Scarlet Witch.

315
00:24:38,997 --> 00:24:40,290
Wanda's gone.

316
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:43,627
She's got the Darkhold, and the Darkhold has her.

317
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:50,384
The Scarlet Witch is a being of unfathomable magic.

318
00:24:51,427 --> 00:24:53,762
She can rewrite reality as she chooses,

319
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:57,725
and is prophesised to either rule

320
00:24:57,891 --> 00:24:59,893
or annihilate the cosmos.

321
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,230
She took over a whole town using her mind.

322
00:25:04,606 --> 00:25:07,192
If she gets America's power,

323
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:09,695
she could enslave the entire Multiverse.

324
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:14,408
So, the person you went to ask for help,

325
00:25:14,575 --> 00:25:16,785
and told exactly where I am,

326
00:25:16,952 --> 00:25:18,512
is the person that's trying to kill me?

327
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,914
Yeah.

328
00:25:21,623 --> 00:25:25,210
Suspend teaching at once and arm the students.

329
00:25:25,377 --> 00:25:27,921
Kamar-Taj must now become a fortress.

330
00:26:03,123 --> 00:26:04,249
Wow.

331
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,877
It's the masters of the Hong Kong and London Sanctums.

332
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:11,173
It's an honour to court death alongside you once again.

333
00:26:11,507 --> 00:26:12,508
The honour is ours.

334
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:15,093
Whatever the Sorcerer Supreme asks of us,

335
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:16,595
it shall be done.

336
00:26:17,137 --> 00:26:18,764
Extra duty men, follow me.

337
00:26:19,181 --> 00:26:20,974
It's ancient custom.

338
00:27:23,662 --> 00:27:25,664
Choose your words wisely.

339
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:28,125
The fate of the Multiverse may depend on it.

340
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:29,334
Got it.

341
00:27:30,586 --> 00:27:32,045
No pressure, then.

342
00:27:45,225 --> 00:27:48,353
All this for a child you met yesterday.

343
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,273
Wanda, you are justifiably angry.

344
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:53,442
You had to make terrible sacrifices.

345
00:27:53,525 --> 00:27:56,236
I blew a hole through the head of the man I loved,

346
00:27:57,571 --> 00:28:00,365
and it meant nothing.

347
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:04,494
Do not speak to me of sacrifice, Stephen Strange.

348
00:28:12,502 --> 00:28:15,547
If you give me what I want,

349
00:28:15,714 --> 00:28:18,383
I'll send you to a world where you can be with Christine.

350
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:24,306
The full might of Kamar-Taj stands against you.

351
00:28:25,223 --> 00:28:28,226
Defensive positions, now!

352
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:37,152
Do not dare to enter these sacred grounds.

353
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:40,739
You have no idea just how reasonable I have been.

354
00:28:40,822 --> 00:28:41,823
Yeah.

355
00:28:41,907 --> 00:28:43,635
Book of the Damned, calling yourself a witch,

356
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:45,118
conjuring creatures to abduct a kid,

357
00:28:45,202 --> 00:28:47,537
I don't exactly call that being reasonable.

358
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:50,165
Sending those creatures after her instead of myself

359
00:28:50,248 --> 00:28:51,750
was mercy.

360
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:56,630
And in spite of your hypocrisies, and insults,

361
00:28:56,713 --> 00:29:00,801
I have begged you to safely get out of my way.

362
00:29:02,135 --> 00:29:04,262
You have exhausted my patience,

363
00:29:05,889 --> 00:29:09,851
but I do hope you understand that even now,

364
00:29:10,018 --> 00:29:11,520
what's about to happen,

365
00:29:12,896 --> 00:29:14,564
this is me

366
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:17,401
being reasonable.

367
00:29:27,327 --> 00:29:28,704
Hold!

368
00:29:30,163 --> 00:29:31,957
Hold!

369
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,639
Nailed it.

370
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,311
Reinforce the shield.

371
00:29:53,478 --> 00:29:55,022
Reinforce the shield!

372
00:29:55,105 --> 00:29:56,481
Reinforce the shield!

373
00:30:16,668 --> 00:30:18,086
She's trying to get in their heads.

374
00:30:18,545 --> 00:30:21,465
Sorcerers, fortify your mind!

375
00:30:33,894 --> 00:30:35,562
Run.

376
00:30:58,502 --> 00:31:00,295
The shield is down!

377
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:06,259
Fire!

378
00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:10,806
Yes!

379
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,193
Take cover!

380
00:31:26,363 --> 00:31:27,989
Fire at will!

381
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:41,169
Fall back.

382
00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:43,380
Wong!

383
00:31:43,463 --> 00:31:44,673
Get out of here!

384
00:31:50,554 --> 00:31:51,638
Go, go.

385
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:52,973
Go!

386
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,598
America...

387
00:32:42,272 --> 00:32:45,275
You want the girl, you'll have to go through me.

388
00:32:46,026 --> 00:32:47,027
Fine.

389
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:58,265
We gotta get you out of here. Now.

390
00:33:58,723 --> 00:33:59,933
Wong, what happened?

391
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,685
Kamar-Taj has fallen.

392
00:34:15,615 --> 00:34:17,158
Reflections.

393
00:34:17,325 --> 00:34:19,160
She's using the reflections. Cover them.

394
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:53,111
You gave all those lives

395
00:34:53,194 --> 00:34:55,905
just to keep me from my children.

396
00:34:56,072 --> 00:34:57,490
You took those lives.

397
00:34:57,866 --> 00:35:00,535
You cannot be allowed to cross into the Multiverse.

398
00:35:01,036 --> 00:35:02,787
I'm not a monster, Stephen.

399
00:35:03,496 --> 00:35:04,539
I'm a mother.

400
00:35:04,622 --> 00:35:06,499
Wanda, you have no children.

401
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:08,752
They don't exist.

402
00:35:08,918 --> 00:35:10,628
Oh, but they do.

403
00:35:10,795 --> 00:35:12,922
In every other universe.

404
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,342
I know they do.

405
00:35:16,051 --> 00:35:17,844
Because I dream of them

406
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,514
every night.

407
00:35:27,896 --> 00:35:28,980
We're gonna show it.

408
00:35:29,147 --> 00:35:30,398
Mom, watch us. Mom!

409
00:35:30,482 --> 00:35:31,733
Go long. Got it!

410
00:35:31,816 --> 00:35:33,234
All right, go on back, go on back.

411
00:35:33,318 --> 00:35:34,598
All right, yeah. Don't...

412
00:35:35,278 --> 00:35:36,363
Of my boys.

413
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:37,757
Billy, don't you dare! No!

414
00:35:37,781 --> 00:35:39,574
Of our life together.

415
00:35:39,657 --> 00:35:41,010
- Here. - Yes!

416
00:35:41,034 --> 00:35:42,577
And then back to front.

417
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,995
Back to front.

418
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:45,663
Can I have some?

419
00:35:45,747 --> 00:35:46,748
Please?

420
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:49,226
- Are you guys ready? - It's okay.

421
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,293
I love you, Mom.

422
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:51,537
Every night...

423
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:55,298
the same dream.

424
00:35:56,716 --> 00:35:58,593
And every morning...

425
00:36:01,513 --> 00:36:04,682
the same nightmare.

426
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:09,270
What if you reach them?

427
00:36:10,897 --> 00:36:12,690
What happens to the other you?

428
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,194
What happens to their mother?

429
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:04,594
You okay?

430
00:38:06,262 --> 00:38:07,555
You saved me.

431
00:38:08,264 --> 00:38:09,849
I hope so.

432
00:38:13,603 --> 00:38:14,643
Surprised you didn't puke.

433
00:38:15,146 --> 00:38:17,524
It's not my first weird trip, kid.

434
00:38:18,107 --> 00:38:20,735
So, this is New York in the Multi...

435
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:23,530
Yep.

436
00:38:23,988 --> 00:38:25,031
There it is.

437
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:32,830
Crap.

438
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:36,417
Cut it out.

439
00:38:39,212 --> 00:38:41,673
Yeah, you got pretty dinged up.

440
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:44,467
We'll get you fixed.

441
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:46,177
All right, America.

442
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,170
You gotta open a portal and get us back there right now.

443
00:38:49,222 --> 00:38:50,306
I don't know how.

444
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,516
You just did it.

445
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,600
Not on purpose.

446
00:38:52,684 --> 00:38:55,645
Wong is back there alone with Wanda, and I'm the only hope he has.

447
00:38:55,728 --> 00:38:56,896
I can't control my powers...

448
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,499
You must be able to control it somehow.

449
00:38:58,523 --> 00:38:59,566
Even I could...

450
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,528
Sorry.

451
00:39:04,862 --> 00:39:07,240
Well, what about this universe's version of you?

452
00:39:07,323 --> 00:39:09,200
Maybe she could control her powers.

453
00:39:09,284 --> 00:39:11,202
This universe doesn't have a me.

454
00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:13,079
- What? - None of them do.

455
00:39:13,162 --> 00:39:14,205
But how do you know that?

456
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:15,832
'Cause I've looked.

457
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:19,419
And 'cause I never dream.

458
00:39:26,509 --> 00:39:28,219
That's okay, kid.

459
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:31,472
And even if you could get me back there, I have no way of fighting Wanda.

460
00:39:32,056 --> 00:39:33,200
What about The Book of Vishanti?

461
00:39:33,224 --> 00:39:34,225
What about it?

462
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:35,560
Other You thought it could stop

463
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:36,644
whoever was after me.

464
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:38,813
Yeah, well, good for Other Me. He's not here, is he?

465
00:39:38,896 --> 00:39:41,941
I don't know where it is, so unless there's another Other Me...

466
00:39:44,193 --> 00:39:45,528
We need to go find...

467
00:39:46,362 --> 00:39:48,823
Other Other Me.

468
00:40:20,688 --> 00:40:21,689
We go on red?

469
00:40:21,773 --> 00:40:24,442
Rule number one of Multiversal travel,

470
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:26,027
you don't know anything.

471
00:40:26,694 --> 00:40:27,695
Right.

472
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:32,283
It's red.

473
00:40:34,118 --> 00:40:36,287
So, what's rule number two?

474
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:40,708
America?

475
00:40:43,503 --> 00:40:44,587
America!

476
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,631
Rule number two,

477
00:40:46,798 --> 00:40:48,091
find food.

478
00:40:48,257 --> 00:40:50,218
Preferably pizza. Pizza balls.

479
00:40:51,177 --> 00:40:52,404
How'd you pay for that?

480
00:40:52,428 --> 00:40:53,429
It was free.

481
00:40:53,596 --> 00:40:55,848
Food's free in most universes, actually.

482
00:40:56,015 --> 00:40:57,892
It's weird you guys have to pay for it.

483
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:00,079
- Hey! You didn't pay for that. - Right.

484
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:01,145
Crap.

485
00:41:01,312 --> 00:41:02,522
Maybe it's not free here.

486
00:41:02,689 --> 00:41:04,649
Pizza Poppa always gets paid.

487
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:06,692
All right, Pizza Poppa, relax. She's just a kid...

488
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:08,045
- She was hungry. - Relax yourself, there,

489
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:09,195
Doctor Strange.

490
00:41:10,446 --> 00:41:12,323
Where'd you get this cape from, anyway?

491
00:41:12,407 --> 00:41:14,117
Oh, that feels authentic.

492
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,178
It's not a cape, it's a cloak, and I suggest you let go.

493
00:41:16,202 --> 00:41:19,580
You took this whole suit from the Strange Museum, didn't you?

494
00:41:19,747 --> 00:41:21,541
- Strange Museum? - You're a taker.

495
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:23,251
Why don't you take some mustard, huh?

496
00:41:32,802 --> 00:41:34,137
Come on. It's not permanent.

497
00:41:35,346 --> 00:41:36,973
Like he'll stop in a few minutes?

498
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,892
About three weeks.

499
00:41:42,937 --> 00:41:45,064
Those universes we went through,

500
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:47,400
were we paint in one of them?

501
00:41:47,567 --> 00:41:49,902
Yeah, you don't wanna get stuck in there.

502
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:51,612
It's really hard to eat.

503
00:41:52,864 --> 00:41:54,699
How many universes have you been to?

504
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:56,743
Uh...

505
00:41:56,826 --> 00:41:57,910
Seventy-two.

506
00:41:58,494 --> 00:41:59,829
Seventy-three, counting this one.

507
00:41:59,912 --> 00:42:00,997
That's...

508
00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:02,707
That's a lot.

509
00:42:02,874 --> 00:42:04,083
Memory Lane.

510
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:05,793

511
00:42:05,877 --> 00:42:07,587
now at a discounted price.

512
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,131
We remember so you don't forget.

513
00:42:16,554 --> 00:42:18,389
This is pretty fancy.

514
00:42:18,931 --> 00:42:21,100
Did you have to take out another student loan?

515
00:42:21,184 --> 00:42:25,062
Nah. I just sold one of those kidneys that we operated on last week.

516
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:30,568
So, um, got you a little something.

517
00:42:33,196 --> 00:42:34,947
Congratulations.

518
00:42:35,531 --> 00:42:36,741
What is it?

519
00:42:37,074 --> 00:42:38,409
Open it and see.

520
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:45,041
Christine, this is...

521
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:48,002
This is amazing. Thank you.

522
00:42:49,629 --> 00:42:51,088
We don't have time for this.

523
00:42:53,925 --> 00:42:55,092
Memory Lane.

524
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:56,928
Replay your significant memories,

525
00:42:57,094 --> 00:42:58,763
now at a discounted price.

526
00:42:58,846 --> 00:43:00,848
We remember so you don't forget.

527
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,398
Where's this?

528
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,735
Home.

529
00:43:13,861 --> 00:43:15,154
My moms.

530
00:43:16,781 --> 00:43:18,157
Son mis madres.

531
00:43:18,658 --> 00:43:21,786
¿Para mí? Ay, qué linda.

532
00:43:22,787 --> 00:43:23,788
Gracias.

533
00:43:24,956 --> 00:43:26,791
A ver, te la pongo.

534
00:43:28,084 --> 00:43:29,669
Mm. Tan hermosa.

535
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:31,921
Te ves bella.

536
00:43:33,297 --> 00:43:35,383
Ándale, nos van a dar otra flor.

537
00:43:42,056 --> 00:43:43,516
America!

538
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:04,328
You know, you were right. This is just a waste of time.

539
00:44:04,495 --> 00:44:05,538
Hey, kid.

540
00:44:06,247 --> 00:44:09,208
That was the first time that you opened a portal, right?

541
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:10,376
Doesn't matter.

542
00:44:10,501 --> 00:44:12,086
It does matter. You lost your parents.

543
00:44:12,253 --> 00:44:14,547
I didn't lose them. I killed them.

544
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,632
No. No, you did not. Don't even think that.

545
00:44:16,799 --> 00:44:19,552
Okay, I opened a portal with the powers I can't control

546
00:44:19,635 --> 00:44:21,655
and sent them to a random, probably deadly universe,

547
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:22,823
- with no way to escape. - Listen,

548
00:44:22,847 --> 00:44:25,349
if your moms are anything like their daughter,

549
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:26,684
they survived.

550
00:44:27,393 --> 00:44:29,604
I'm sure you'll meet them again someday.

551
00:44:33,816 --> 00:44:34,859
Not bad.

552
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,570
Thanks.

553
00:44:39,071 --> 00:44:41,032
That woman in your memory bank thing,

554
00:44:41,198 --> 00:44:42,491
that was Christine, right?

555
00:44:43,743 --> 00:44:45,995
Yes, that was Christine.

556
00:44:46,162 --> 00:44:47,955
- How do you know her? - From Other You.

557
00:44:48,581 --> 00:44:49,749
Were they together?

558
00:44:49,832 --> 00:44:51,375
No, they didn't talk any more.

559
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:52,543
He blew it.

560
00:44:52,627 --> 00:44:53,628
Of course.

561
00:44:54,754 --> 00:44:56,547
Did you blow it with your Christine?

562
00:44:58,049 --> 00:44:59,926
Yes, I guess I did.

563
00:45:00,092 --> 00:45:01,093
Why?

564
00:45:01,677 --> 00:45:03,512
Complicated.

565
00:45:03,596 --> 00:45:05,157
More complicated than being chased by a witch

566
00:45:05,181 --> 00:45:06,182
through the Multiverse?

567
00:45:06,265 --> 00:45:08,225
Yes, actually, it is.

568
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:50,309
"Gave his life defeating Thanos"?

569
00:45:50,393 --> 00:45:52,353
Yeah. See? We're not all bad.

570
00:45:53,604 --> 00:45:55,481
If Other You's dead,

571
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,441
who's Master of the Sanctum?

572
00:46:03,447 --> 00:46:05,408
Oh, shit.

573
00:46:15,251 --> 00:46:17,670
- You know him? - Yeah. Mordo.

574
00:46:17,753 --> 00:46:19,856
He was actually the first guy who let me into Kamar-Taj.

575
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,881
Oh, great.

576
00:46:20,965 --> 00:46:21,966
And then he snapped

577
00:46:22,049 --> 00:46:24,135
and dedicated his life to trying to kill me.

578
00:46:24,301 --> 00:46:25,678
Oh.

579
00:46:25,845 --> 00:46:27,096
Great.

580
00:46:31,726 --> 00:46:34,061
I always suspected this day would come.

581
00:46:34,145 --> 00:46:35,146
You did?

582
00:46:35,563 --> 00:46:36,564
Yes.

583
00:46:37,398 --> 00:46:41,193
Because you always suspected this day would come.

584
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,412
My brother.

585
00:46:54,915 --> 00:46:55,916
All right.

586
00:46:58,002 --> 00:46:59,378
Come in,

587
00:46:59,462 --> 00:47:03,716
and tell me everything about your universe.

588
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,681
You go on red.

589
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,430
And you're quite formidable too, it seems.

590
00:47:15,811 --> 00:47:18,314
A Multiversal traveller.

591
00:47:18,397 --> 00:47:21,734
Well, thank the stars you brought Doctor Strange to safety.

592
00:47:21,817 --> 00:47:24,570
Well, just 'cause we jumped ship doesn't mean we're safe.

593
00:47:24,653 --> 00:47:27,823
Our Wanda has the ability to conjure demons and monsters

594
00:47:27,907 --> 00:47:30,326
to attack America in other universes.

595
00:47:30,409 --> 00:47:31,952
So she has the Darkhold?

596
00:47:32,036 --> 00:47:33,537
Oh, you know of the Darkhold?

597
00:47:33,621 --> 00:47:36,332
Oh, yes. We have a Darkhold in this universe, too.

598
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:38,584
I guard it here in this Sanctum.

599
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:41,087
We would never risk a weapon that dangerous

600
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,546
falling into the wrong hands.

601
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:43,756
Damn right.

602
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,633
But if your Darkhold is anything like ours,

603
00:47:45,716 --> 00:47:47,259
I'm afraid she can do far worse

604
00:47:47,343 --> 00:47:50,888
than just summon monsters to come after you here.

605
00:47:51,472 --> 00:47:52,473
What do you mean?

606
00:47:52,681 --> 00:47:56,811
There is a spell contained within those pages...

607
00:47:58,395 --> 00:48:00,231
...corrosive to the soul,

608
00:48:01,857 --> 00:48:04,360
a desecration of reality itself.

609
00:48:06,278 --> 00:48:07,279
Dreamwalking.

610
00:48:09,323 --> 00:48:12,493
A Dreamwalking sorcerer projects their own consciousness

611
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,204
from their universe into another,

612
00:48:16,205 --> 00:48:19,125
possessing the body of an alternate self.

613
00:48:22,044 --> 00:48:24,839
They may puppeteer this unholy doppelganger

614
00:48:24,922 --> 00:48:27,299
and pursue their enemies from afar.

615
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,097
The possession is not a permanent link

616
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,932
between realities.

617
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:37,685
But in the fleeting time they Dreamwalk,

618
00:48:37,852 --> 00:48:41,730
they can do irreparable damage to the universe they invade.

619
00:48:44,525 --> 00:48:47,444
So it may not be a demon that you face.

620
00:48:49,697 --> 00:48:52,491
It may be the Scarlet Witch.

621
00:48:54,577 --> 00:48:56,078
Why didn't she do that to begin with?

622
00:48:56,162 --> 00:48:58,497
Because that was her being reasonable.

623
00:48:59,748 --> 00:49:01,348
What do you know of The Book of Vishanti?

624
00:49:01,458 --> 00:49:03,002
The Darkhold's antithesis?

625
00:49:04,128 --> 00:49:05,379
It can give a sorcerer

626
00:49:05,462 --> 00:49:08,424
whatever power they need to vanquish their enemy.

627
00:49:10,217 --> 00:49:12,761
I need your help to get me to it.

628
00:49:16,348 --> 00:49:17,600
I'm sorry, Stephen.

629
00:49:19,143 --> 00:49:22,855
But I hope you, of all people, understand

630
00:49:23,272 --> 00:49:25,399
that it is not Wanda Maximoff

631
00:49:25,482 --> 00:49:27,735
who threatens our reality,

632
00:49:28,861 --> 00:49:31,322
it's the two of you.

633
00:49:31,405 --> 00:49:33,574
- Oh, God. - What was in that tea?

634
00:49:37,453 --> 00:49:41,165
You son of a bitch.

635
00:49:51,884 --> 00:49:53,928
The Sands of Nisanti.

636
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,890
I'm only acting as you would.

637
00:50:00,726 --> 00:50:02,770
She's coming.

638
00:50:25,834 --> 00:50:27,020
Boys, it's time for bed.

639
00:50:27,044 --> 00:50:28,724
Can we have a little more ice cream?

640
00:50:28,754 --> 00:50:30,106
- Please. - Please, please, please!

641
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,131
A little more, please!

642
00:50:31,215 --> 00:50:32,651
Hey, don't make Mom out to be the bad guy.

643
00:50:32,675 --> 00:50:33,818
You know who's the best?

644
00:50:33,842 --> 00:50:36,220
- Who? - 2003 Tigers.

645
00:50:36,303 --> 00:50:37,304
They suck.

646
00:50:37,388 --> 00:50:39,431
They're so bad they suck egg.

647
00:50:39,515 --> 00:50:41,267
No, they don't. They're the best.

648
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,143
- Doofus. - Doofus 2.

649
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,145
Triple infinity doofus.

650
00:50:45,229 --> 00:50:48,524
Infinity infinity googolplex quadruple doofus.

651
00:50:48,691 --> 00:50:52,111
Quintuple infinity... Crazy doofus.

652
00:50:52,278 --> 00:50:53,964
Googolplex doofus.

653
00:51:45,122 --> 00:51:46,165
Mom?

654
00:51:51,628 --> 00:51:53,255
Yes, sweetheart?

655
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:54,757
Where are you going?

656
00:51:58,469 --> 00:52:00,929
Just to take out the trash.

657
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:03,849
Can we show you something?

658
00:52:05,934 --> 00:52:08,354
Mom, hurry, come on!

659
00:52:08,437 --> 00:52:09,855
Come on, it's important.

660
00:52:09,938 --> 00:52:10,939
Mom.

661
00:52:11,023 --> 00:52:12,775
You'll like it.

662
00:52:12,858 --> 00:52:15,486
Come on. Hurry up.

663
00:52:15,569 --> 00:52:16,695
It's important.

664
00:52:17,654 --> 00:52:20,491
Okay, so, Mom, listen to this...

665
00:52:20,574 --> 00:52:21,575
I'm gonna start it.

666
00:52:21,658 --> 00:52:22,969
- No, I wanna start it. - I wanna start it.

667
00:52:22,993 --> 00:52:24,054
- I want to start! - No, I want to start!

668
00:52:24,078 --> 00:52:25,180
- No! I want to start. - I want to start.

669
00:52:25,204 --> 00:52:29,708
Why don't you both start it,

670
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:33,087
whatever it is, together?

671
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:35,547
- Okay. - Okay.

672
00:52:35,631 --> 00:52:36,882
- You ready? - Yeah.

673
00:52:36,965 --> 00:52:39,676
Three, two, one, go.

674
00:52:39,968 --> 00:52:43,222
We like ice cream

675
00:52:43,305 --> 00:52:46,725
Like every child should

676
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:50,479
And if we get some ice cream

677
00:52:50,562 --> 00:52:55,901
We promise to be good

678
00:53:23,929 --> 00:53:24,930
You're alive.

679
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:26,640
Yes.

680
00:53:27,266 --> 00:53:29,184
But so many others were lost.

681
00:53:31,103 --> 00:53:32,479
Set me free.

682
00:53:32,646 --> 00:53:34,148
I need to destroy the book.

683
00:53:34,314 --> 00:53:37,109
No. It cannot be you.

684
00:53:44,908 --> 00:53:47,161
Sara. No, no!

685
00:54:05,846 --> 00:54:07,264
Mom!

686
00:54:07,431 --> 00:54:08,640
What happened?

687
00:54:11,018 --> 00:54:12,311
- What? - Are you okay?

688
00:54:15,147 --> 00:54:17,441
Okay. Billy, Tommy.

689
00:54:19,026 --> 00:54:20,027
What?

690
00:54:25,866 --> 00:54:29,745
No, no, no.

691
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:51,892
I need the Darkhold's spells.

692
00:54:51,975 --> 00:54:54,520
You are the Sorcerer Supreme.

693
00:54:54,728 --> 00:54:55,938
Tell me what you know.

694
00:54:57,731 --> 00:54:59,525
You're gonna have to kill me, witch.

695
00:55:00,234 --> 00:55:01,401
Not you.

696
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:04,071
Them.

697
00:55:10,202 --> 00:55:11,370
Wanda, stop.

698
00:55:14,081 --> 00:55:15,374
Wanda, please!

699
00:55:20,379 --> 00:55:22,381
The Darkhold was a copy!

700
00:55:25,133 --> 00:55:26,343
A copy?

701
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:27,803
Legend speaks of a mountain

702
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:30,639
with the wretched spells you seek carved into its walls.

703
00:55:31,974 --> 00:55:34,643
It's there the Darkhold was transcribed.

704
00:55:35,602 --> 00:55:36,853
Mount Wundagore.

705
00:55:37,854 --> 00:55:39,189
Wundagore?

706
00:55:39,982 --> 00:55:41,858
No one has survived the journey.

707
00:55:46,238 --> 00:55:48,949
Perhaps we will be the exception.

708
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:57,666
Hey!

709
00:55:57,749 --> 00:55:59,710
Hey!

710
00:56:12,222 --> 00:56:14,016
This universe sucks.

711
00:56:16,935 --> 00:56:18,020
Cloak?

712
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:30,490
Hey.

713
00:56:32,284 --> 00:56:33,535
Hey, lab coat.

714
00:56:34,286 --> 00:56:35,370
Where the hell are we?

715
00:56:36,788 --> 00:56:37,849
Look, I don't know who you are,

716
00:56:37,873 --> 00:56:39,750
or what you think you're trying to do here,

717
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:41,251
but these situations don't usually

718
00:56:41,335 --> 00:56:42,377
work out well

719
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:44,630
for the nameless scientists, so just...

720
00:56:49,217 --> 00:56:50,510
Christine?

721
00:56:52,346 --> 00:56:53,430
Hello, Stephen.

722
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:55,098
Ay Dios.

723
00:56:55,974 --> 00:56:57,100
Miss Chavez.

724
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,062
Uh, to answer your question,

725
00:57:00,228 --> 00:57:02,689
you are in a highly secure research facility.

726
00:57:02,856 --> 00:57:05,067
The two of you, along with your sentient cloak,

727
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:07,110
are here for surveillance and testing.

728
00:57:07,194 --> 00:57:09,321
Uh... Uh, testing?

729
00:57:09,404 --> 00:57:11,990
Well, yes. You're visitors from another universe.

730
00:57:12,157 --> 00:57:15,702
Your magnetic signatures could be radioactive,

731
00:57:15,869 --> 00:57:18,497
you may be carrying diseases we just don't have treatments for.

732
00:57:19,289 --> 00:57:22,209
Hence, these amazing polycarbonate fish bowls.

733
00:57:23,669 --> 00:57:26,296
I assume I have you to thank for these, then?

734
00:57:26,797 --> 00:57:30,008
Yes. I developed those using the Sands of Nisanti.

735
00:57:30,175 --> 00:57:32,469
One of 838 Stephen's magical relics.

736
00:57:32,636 --> 00:57:33,679
838 Stephen?

737
00:57:33,762 --> 00:57:35,347
Is that some kind of cyborg me, or...

738
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:37,349
Our universe is 838,

739
00:57:37,432 --> 00:57:39,810
and we've designated yours 616.

740
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,813
Oh. You guys sure must know a lot about the Multiverse

741
00:57:42,979 --> 00:57:45,148
if you got someone going around naming realities.

742
00:57:45,315 --> 00:57:46,316
Yes.

743
00:57:47,067 --> 00:57:48,318
Me.

744
00:57:48,485 --> 00:57:50,487
I'm a senior fellow with the Baxter Foundation,

745
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:52,614
and I specialise in Multiversal research.

746
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:57,077
So, how'd you end up working here?

747
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,121
Wherever here is.

748
00:57:59,287 --> 00:58:00,687
Well, I volunteered.

749
00:58:01,206 --> 00:58:02,582
At your funeral.

750
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:05,127
Thank you for going.

751
00:58:05,627 --> 00:58:07,671
Your injuries, they're similar,

752
00:58:07,754 --> 00:58:08,922
but they're not identical.

753
00:58:09,005 --> 00:58:10,215
It's fascinating.

754
00:58:15,971 --> 00:58:20,308
What were we to each other in this universe?

755
00:58:23,979 --> 00:58:25,981
We never quite figured that out.

756
00:58:26,273 --> 00:58:27,399
Yeah?

757
00:58:29,025 --> 00:58:31,111
Well, that's something we got in common.

758
00:58:33,905 --> 00:58:37,159
Christine, you gotta let us out of here.

759
00:58:37,993 --> 00:58:39,703
Everyone's in real danger.

760
00:58:39,786 --> 00:58:41,830
Look, I know you don't know me...

761
00:58:41,955 --> 00:58:42,956
And I don't want to.

762
00:58:43,498 --> 00:58:46,001
Whatever I was to you in your universe

763
00:58:46,084 --> 00:58:47,294
does not matter.

764
00:58:48,545 --> 00:58:49,629
Why not?

765
00:58:54,593 --> 00:58:56,303
Because you're dangerous, Stephen.

766
00:58:58,096 --> 00:59:00,640
Someone from my universe wants that girl,

767
00:59:00,724 --> 00:59:03,518
and she's gonna rip this place apart atom-by-atom

768
00:59:03,602 --> 00:59:05,228
until she gets what she wants.

769
00:59:05,312 --> 00:59:07,689
So I don't care if you're from the Avengers

770
00:59:07,773 --> 00:59:08,774
or S.H.I.E.L.D...

771
00:59:08,857 --> 00:59:09,900
We're neither.

772
00:59:15,781 --> 00:59:16,990
Well, what then?

773
00:59:17,157 --> 00:59:18,200
HYDRA?

774
00:59:18,283 --> 00:59:22,454
The Illuminati will see you now.

775
00:59:22,537 --> 00:59:23,830
The Illumi-what-y?

776
00:59:31,922 --> 00:59:33,548
Don't let anyone hurt that kid.

777
00:59:37,844 --> 00:59:39,221
It's gonna be okay.

778
01:00:08,834 --> 01:00:11,419
You couldn't portal us up there?

779
01:00:11,586 --> 01:00:14,005
My magic can only take us so far.

780
01:00:14,381 --> 01:00:16,675
Masters of the Mystic Arts weren't meant to tread

781
01:00:16,842 --> 01:00:19,219
upon the forbidden grounds of Wundagore.

782
01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:48,915
Eons ago, the first demon, Chthon,

783
01:00:48,999 --> 01:00:52,711
carved his dark magic into this tomb.

784
01:00:52,878 --> 01:00:57,632
These same spells were later transcribed into the Darkhold.

785
01:01:13,064 --> 01:01:16,610
There's no telling what soulless monstrosities lie within.

786
01:01:59,319 --> 01:02:01,029
They've been waiting for me.

787
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,039
This isn't a tomb.

788
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:16,795
It's a throne.

789
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:53,540
Stephen Strange,

790
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:56,835
you are now called before the Illuminati.

791
01:02:57,043 --> 01:02:59,295
I, Baron Karl Mordo,

792
01:02:59,379 --> 01:03:00,880
the Sorcerer Supreme, do hereby...

793
01:03:00,964 --> 01:03:02,090
"Karl"?

794
01:03:06,386 --> 01:03:08,572
Captain Carter.

795
01:03:08,596 --> 01:03:09,806
The first Avenger.

796
01:03:10,849 --> 01:03:12,183
Blackagar Boltagon.

797
01:03:12,267 --> 01:03:15,186
Keeper of the Terrigen Mists, the Inhuman king.

798
01:03:15,353 --> 01:03:17,480
Blackagar Boltagard? Huh.

799
01:03:17,897 --> 01:03:19,107
Hidigy hidithere.

800
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,445
Captain Marvel. Defender of the cosmos.

801
01:03:25,488 --> 01:03:27,532
And the smartest man alive,

802
01:03:27,699 --> 01:03:30,285
Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four.

803
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:32,620
Hello, Stephen.

804
01:03:32,704 --> 01:03:35,206
"Fantastic Four". Didn't you guys chart in the '60s?

805
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:37,459
I'm sorry, is this a joke to you?

806
01:03:37,542 --> 01:03:39,020
Well, there's a guy over there with a fork on his head,

807
01:03:39,044 --> 01:03:40,336
so, yeah, a little bit.

808
01:03:41,796 --> 01:03:44,340
Be grateful Black Bolt doesn't engage you in conversation.

809
01:03:44,424 --> 01:03:46,176
Why? Does he have bad breath?

810
01:03:46,551 --> 01:03:48,386
This Strange is even more arrogant than ours.

811
01:03:48,636 --> 01:03:50,597
- Hmm. - No, just more alive.

812
01:03:50,764 --> 01:03:51,890
For now.

813
01:03:53,475 --> 01:03:54,851
Stephen, your arrival here

814
01:03:54,934 --> 01:03:57,353
confuses and destabilises reality.

815
01:03:58,188 --> 01:03:59,828
The larger the footprint you leave behind,

816
01:03:59,856 --> 01:04:01,649
the greater the risk of an Incursion.

817
01:04:01,733 --> 01:04:02,734
Incursion?

818
01:04:02,817 --> 01:04:03,902
An Incursion occurs

819
01:04:03,985 --> 01:04:07,072
when the boundary between two universes erodes

820
01:04:07,238 --> 01:04:08,448
and they collide,

821
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:13,203
destroying one or both entirely.

822
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:16,623
Your alternate self created the Illuminati

823
01:04:16,706 --> 01:04:19,250
to make difficult decisions that no one else could.

824
01:04:19,334 --> 01:04:23,129
Today, we're here to determine what to do with you and the child.

825
01:04:23,296 --> 01:04:25,048
So, before we vote,

826
01:04:25,131 --> 01:04:28,885
if you got anything serious to say, now's the time.

827
01:04:28,968 --> 01:04:30,261
Yeah, I do.

828
01:04:30,345 --> 01:04:31,781
If it's Incursions you're worried about,

829
01:04:31,805 --> 01:04:34,516
do you seriously think I'm a bigger threat than the Scarlet Witch?

830
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:37,727
Oh, we can handle your little witch if she decides to Dreamwalk.

831
01:04:37,894 --> 01:04:39,145
No. No, you cannot.

832
01:04:39,229 --> 01:04:41,314
Not unless you give me The Book of Vishanti.

833
01:04:41,397 --> 01:04:42,857
We appreciate your concern, Stephen,

834
01:04:42,941 --> 01:04:45,110
but it's not the Scarlet Witch that we fear.

835
01:04:45,193 --> 01:04:46,945
From our experience, the greatest danger

836
01:04:47,028 --> 01:04:48,988
to the Multiverse, it turns out,

837
01:04:49,155 --> 01:04:50,782
is Doctor Strange.

838
01:04:51,658 --> 01:04:53,701
Wait. Your Doctor Strange?

839
01:04:53,785 --> 01:04:56,371
Earth's mightiest hero who died defeating Thanos?

840
01:04:56,454 --> 01:04:58,294
We should tell him the truth.

841
01:05:06,339 --> 01:05:07,590
Our final member,

842
01:05:08,842 --> 01:05:10,677
Professor Charles Xavier.

843
01:05:12,554 --> 01:05:13,555
What truth?

844
01:05:13,638 --> 01:05:16,307
That's not how our Strange died.

845
01:05:34,075 --> 01:05:36,077
You're wondering what happens now.

846
01:05:36,828 --> 01:05:38,079
No.

847
01:05:38,246 --> 01:05:39,873
That I've already accepted.

848
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,749
But I do wonder

849
01:05:43,251 --> 01:05:46,796
when you could force America to send you to any universe you want,

850
01:05:46,963 --> 01:05:48,840
why take her power for your own?

851
01:05:48,923 --> 01:05:50,758
You know it would kill her.

852
01:05:50,842 --> 01:05:52,677
For Billy and Tommy, to protect them.

853
01:05:53,887 --> 01:05:55,221
What if they get sick?

854
01:05:56,347 --> 01:05:59,434
In the infinite Multiverse, there's a cure for every illness.

855
01:06:00,727 --> 01:06:04,063
A solution to every problem.

856
01:06:06,441 --> 01:06:08,401
I won't lose them again.

857
01:06:08,484 --> 01:06:11,571
Try as you might, Wanda, you cannot control everything.

858
01:06:11,654 --> 01:06:13,281
But I can.

859
01:06:13,448 --> 01:06:15,074
Look around you.

860
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,952
It's carved in stone.

861
01:06:19,996 --> 01:06:22,332
I was meant to rule everything.

862
01:06:27,086 --> 01:06:29,047
But that's not what I want.

863
01:06:29,756 --> 01:06:31,007
I just want my boys.

864
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:33,134
At the cost of a child's life?

865
01:06:34,344 --> 01:06:35,887
Is there no peace in knowing

866
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:38,348
that even though you can't be with the ones you love,

867
01:06:38,431 --> 01:06:40,642
there are worlds where you are together?

868
01:06:40,808 --> 01:06:41,809
Is that not enough?

869
01:06:42,352 --> 01:06:43,603
No.

870
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:24,143
Our Strange did not die defeating Thanos.

871
01:07:24,769 --> 01:07:26,479
We were at war.

872
01:07:26,646 --> 01:07:30,358
While the rest of us banded together to try to stop Thanos,

873
01:07:30,525 --> 01:07:34,487
Stephen, as always, chose to go it alone.

874
01:07:34,654 --> 01:07:36,364
He turned to the Darkhold,

875
01:07:36,531 --> 01:07:38,116
began Dreamwalking,

876
01:07:38,283 --> 01:07:40,827
in hopes that our salvation might lie in the Multiverse.

877
01:07:41,202 --> 01:07:42,442
And guess what?

878
01:07:42,578 --> 01:07:45,164
It didn't. But he kept doing it anyway.

879
01:07:45,373 --> 01:07:47,333
One night, you called us all together,

880
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:49,460
confessed that you had been Dreamwalking,

881
01:07:49,627 --> 01:07:52,922
and in your words, "Things had gotten out of hand."

882
01:07:53,089 --> 01:07:55,383
You never told us the details of what had happened,

883
01:07:55,466 --> 01:07:57,385
only that you had inadvertently triggered

884
01:07:57,468 --> 01:07:58,636
an Incursion.

885
01:07:59,137 --> 01:08:00,513
You, our friend,

886
01:08:01,055 --> 01:08:04,517
had caused the annihilation of another universe.

887
01:08:04,892 --> 01:08:07,312
Everyone in that reality died.

888
01:08:07,478 --> 01:08:08,479
Everyone.

889
01:08:08,646 --> 01:08:10,927
Stephen renounced the Darkhold's evil

890
01:08:10,982 --> 01:08:13,109
and helped us find The Book of Vishanti,

891
01:08:13,276 --> 01:08:17,405
a weapon we did use together to defeat Thanos.

892
01:08:17,572 --> 01:08:19,741
But one final threat remained.

893
01:08:47,727 --> 01:08:50,146
I shall miss you, my friend.

894
01:08:54,025 --> 01:08:55,401
I'm ready.

895
01:09:03,493 --> 01:09:05,703
I'm sorry.

896
01:09:27,392 --> 01:09:29,018
Did you tell Christine?

897
01:09:30,269 --> 01:09:31,354
Yes.

898
01:09:37,026 --> 01:09:38,027
The statue...

899
01:09:38,111 --> 01:09:39,570
What about the statue?

900
01:09:42,573 --> 01:09:43,825
You built a statue.

901
01:09:43,908 --> 01:09:45,618
The world needs heroes.

902
01:09:46,411 --> 01:09:47,471
We made the difficult choice

903
01:09:47,495 --> 01:09:49,497
because we knew what our Strange was capable of.

904
01:09:51,124 --> 01:09:52,500
What, perhaps,

905
01:09:52,583 --> 01:09:55,294
every Doctor Strange is capable of.

906
01:09:59,132 --> 01:10:00,425
The building's been breached.

907
01:10:00,591 --> 01:10:02,552
No shit, genius.

908
01:10:03,052 --> 01:10:04,637
Status report on sentries.

909
01:10:07,014 --> 01:10:08,334
Stop where you...

910
01:10:08,599 --> 01:10:10,601
Get back!

911
01:10:15,148 --> 01:10:17,191
Stop where you are...

912
01:10:17,275 --> 01:10:18,568
She's heading for the child.

913
01:10:18,651 --> 01:10:20,445
Watch him. We'll vote on our return.

914
01:10:22,196 --> 01:10:24,991
Stephen, should you manage to escape this chamber,

915
01:10:25,158 --> 01:10:27,160
you must guide America Chavez.

916
01:10:27,326 --> 01:10:28,619
What the hell are you saying?

917
01:10:28,744 --> 01:10:31,080
Save the girl and get to The Book of Vishanti.

918
01:10:31,247 --> 01:10:32,707
What? You have the book here?

919
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:35,126
Yes. You built a waypoint.

920
01:10:35,209 --> 01:10:37,378
Charles, we cannot trust him.

921
01:10:37,545 --> 01:10:39,505
I believe we can.

922
01:10:40,256 --> 01:10:42,800
Just because someone stumbles and loses their way

923
01:10:42,884 --> 01:10:44,719
doesn't mean they're lost forever.

924
01:10:45,428 --> 01:10:49,182
We will see what kind of Doctor Strange you are.

925
01:10:49,974 --> 01:10:50,975
Thank you.

926
01:10:51,851 --> 01:10:53,519
Perimeter breakdown.

927
01:10:53,603 --> 01:10:56,689
All sentries engage.

928
01:10:58,357 --> 01:10:59,358
Everybody out.

929
01:10:59,442 --> 01:11:01,202
- Intruder approaching. - Now!

930
01:11:03,321 --> 01:11:04,447
It's Wanda.

931
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:19,921
Ultron commands you to halt.

932
01:11:22,048 --> 01:11:24,091
Ultron commands...

933
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,763
Hurry, hurry! She's coming!

934
01:11:33,309 --> 01:11:34,477
Oh, no.

935
01:11:55,998 --> 01:11:57,250
Wanda, stop.

936
01:11:58,084 --> 01:12:00,964
You've possessed an innocent woman, but you can still do the right thing.

937
01:12:01,796 --> 01:12:02,964
Let her go.

938
01:12:06,133 --> 01:12:07,134
Please.

939
01:12:07,802 --> 01:12:10,846
I have children of my own. I understand your pain.

940
01:12:11,013 --> 01:12:13,349
Is their mother still alive?

941
01:12:14,559 --> 01:12:15,560
Yes.

942
01:12:15,726 --> 01:12:19,939
Good. There will be someone left to raise them.

943
01:12:22,567 --> 01:12:26,571
Wanda, Black Bolt could destroy you with one whisper from his mouth.

944
01:12:28,489 --> 01:12:29,490
What mouth?

945
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:30,676
Take me to The Book of Vishanti, so that we can fight her together.

946
01:13:30,843 --> 01:13:32,803
You are in no position to give orders.

947
01:13:34,138 --> 01:13:37,141
My vote will conclude these proceedings when they return.

948
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:50,696
Haven't you had enough?

949
01:13:51,906 --> 01:13:53,324
Oh, I could do this all day.

950
01:14:29,694 --> 01:14:32,321
Get the hell out of my universe!

951
01:15:06,272 --> 01:15:07,898
They're not coming back.

952
01:15:08,065 --> 01:15:11,277
And you just cast your vote now to kill your friends.

953
01:15:15,156 --> 01:15:16,782
Not that that ever bothered you before.

954
01:15:19,869 --> 01:15:22,079
You know, you hated me where I came from.

955
01:15:22,246 --> 01:15:23,914
And I bet secretly, my brother,

956
01:15:23,998 --> 01:15:25,249
you hated me here.

957
01:15:25,332 --> 01:15:27,293
You must've been so jealous.

958
01:15:27,793 --> 01:15:28,794
Do you know what?

959
01:15:28,878 --> 01:15:31,064
I bet you were thrilled when you heard I'd been corrupted.

960
01:15:31,088 --> 01:15:32,983
Hell, you probably gave me the Darkhold to begin with...

961
01:15:33,007 --> 01:15:34,842
You know nothing of this universe!

962
01:15:34,925 --> 01:15:38,637
I know that killing Stephen Strange was your ticket to getting the Sanctum,

963
01:15:38,804 --> 01:15:40,264
to becoming Sorcerer Supreme,

964
01:15:40,431 --> 01:15:42,151
and to joining your little circus of clowns,

965
01:15:42,183 --> 01:15:43,184
the Illuminati.

966
01:15:43,267 --> 01:15:44,727
I'm ready...

967
01:15:47,772 --> 01:15:50,691
to cast my vote now.

968
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,633
I think I'm beginning to understand

969
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:01,679
why your Mordo didn't like you very much!

970
01:17:04,306 --> 01:17:05,307
You're sealed shut!

971
01:17:15,192 --> 01:17:16,861
Okay. Get back.

972
01:17:28,122 --> 01:17:30,165
- Whoa. - Whoa.

973
01:17:34,795 --> 01:17:35,915
Enough!

974
01:18:30,976 --> 01:18:33,020
Help me. Please.

975
01:18:33,187 --> 01:18:35,814
Wanda Maximoff, your mind is being held hostage

976
01:18:35,898 --> 01:18:36,982
by your alternate self.

977
01:18:40,694 --> 01:18:41,820
Grab my hand.

978
01:18:42,696 --> 01:18:45,074
Perhaps, if I can pull you from under the rubble,

979
01:18:45,491 --> 01:18:46,742
the spell will break.

980
01:19:33,372 --> 01:19:35,541
Hey! You all right?

981
01:19:37,001 --> 01:19:38,002
You okay?

982
01:19:39,461 --> 01:19:40,462
Hey.

983
01:19:42,006 --> 01:19:43,757
- You all right? - Yeah.

984
01:19:45,509 --> 01:19:46,510
Hey.

985
01:19:48,012 --> 01:19:49,430
She fixed him.

986
01:19:49,513 --> 01:19:50,865
- Thank you. - Yeah.

987
01:19:50,889 --> 01:19:52,993
Xavier said I built a waypoint to The Book of Vishanti.

988
01:19:53,017 --> 01:19:54,059
Can you take us there?

989
01:19:54,143 --> 01:19:55,203
How am I supposed to trust you?

990
01:19:55,227 --> 01:19:57,354
I know what happened, and I'm sorry for what he did,

991
01:19:57,438 --> 01:19:59,606
but believe me, The Book of Vishanti is the only way.

992
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:00,875
Yeah. Your way.

993
01:20:00,899 --> 01:20:03,193
You sound a lot like my Stephen right now.

994
01:20:03,277 --> 01:20:04,754
He had to be the one holding the knife,

995
01:20:04,778 --> 01:20:07,072
and then that knife killed a trillion people.

996
01:20:07,156 --> 01:20:08,824
This Stephen is different.

997
01:20:09,658 --> 01:20:10,659
He is.

998
01:20:10,826 --> 01:20:12,666
It doesn't matter about all the other Stephens.

999
01:20:13,996 --> 01:20:15,372
You're not like them.

1000
01:20:19,334 --> 01:20:20,461
Smart kid.

1001
01:20:25,007 --> 01:20:26,047
Give me your hand.

1002
01:20:29,803 --> 01:20:32,473
Do not make me regret this.

1003
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:33,724
I won't.

1004
01:20:35,184 --> 01:20:36,935
- Okay, can we go now? - Yeah, follow me.

1005
01:20:51,533 --> 01:20:52,534
Where's that tunnel go?

1006
01:20:52,826 --> 01:20:54,244
Under the river.

1007
01:21:02,044 --> 01:21:03,420
Go, go, go, go, go!

1008
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:09,862
Where did she go?

1009
01:22:20,873 --> 01:22:22,082
I warned you.

1010
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:25,377
Other Wanda, if you're in there,

1011
01:22:25,544 --> 01:22:26,587
hold your breath.

1012
01:22:36,221 --> 01:22:38,265
- Did you kill her? - No, just bought us some time.

1013
01:22:40,392 --> 01:22:41,685
The Book's through here.

1014
01:22:41,768 --> 01:22:43,128
But only Stephen's ever opened it.

1015
01:22:53,405 --> 01:22:54,573
Shit.

1016
01:22:55,532 --> 01:22:57,093
An enchantment that's specific to me,

1017
01:22:57,117 --> 01:22:58,178
something only I would know.

1018
01:22:58,202 --> 01:22:59,953
- Wait. Stephen. - Come on.

1019
01:23:00,454 --> 01:23:02,706
Come on.

1020
01:23:02,873 --> 01:23:04,374
Stephen.

1021
01:23:12,758 --> 01:23:13,759
Yeah.

1022
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,721
Thank you.

1023
01:23:18,347 --> 01:23:19,806
Sure.

1024
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:26,605
Open sesame.

1025
01:23:59,263 --> 01:24:00,264
Come on, kid.

1026
01:24:00,889 --> 01:24:02,099
You got this.

1027
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:05,143
We got this.

1028
01:24:07,521 --> 01:24:08,605
Yeah.

1029
01:24:16,613 --> 01:24:17,614
You all right?

1030
01:24:17,781 --> 01:24:18,907
Yeah.

1031
01:24:21,285 --> 01:24:24,496
This is the Gap Junction, the space between universes.

1032
01:24:37,718 --> 01:24:39,177
All right, Book.

1033
01:24:42,472 --> 01:24:43,849
Give me what I need.

1034
01:25:02,367 --> 01:25:03,368
- No! - No!

1035
01:25:56,922 --> 01:25:58,215
My boys.

1036
01:26:09,935 --> 01:26:11,535
This isn't what your children would want.

1037
01:26:27,577 --> 01:26:28,995
They'll never know.

1038
01:26:29,162 --> 01:26:30,247
Maybe not.

1039
01:26:30,831 --> 01:26:31,832
But you will.

1040
01:26:35,794 --> 01:26:37,045
Oh, no.

1041
01:26:37,212 --> 01:26:38,547
Oh, crap.

1042
01:26:40,257 --> 01:26:43,051
It's like this reality collapsed in on itself.

1043
01:26:43,135 --> 01:26:44,177
Yeah.

1044
01:26:44,678 --> 01:26:47,431
Or two realities collided.

1045
01:26:47,514 --> 01:26:48,682
Come on.

1046
01:26:49,141 --> 01:26:50,851
America doesn't have long.

1047
01:26:51,268 --> 01:26:52,703
So where are we going?

1048
01:26:52,727 --> 01:26:54,896
Well, if there's still a sanctum

1049
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:56,022
in this universe,

1050
01:26:57,149 --> 01:27:00,694
then there might be another Other Other Me,

1051
01:27:00,861 --> 01:27:03,363
and that's our best shot of getting back to her.

1052
01:27:15,834 --> 01:27:19,171
Well, I can see why you guys were so worried about Incursions.

1053
01:27:21,298 --> 01:27:22,716
Whatever happened,

1054
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,969
this universe's you didn't do a very good job

1055
01:27:26,052 --> 01:27:27,262
of stopping it.

1056
01:27:37,689 --> 01:27:39,524
I'll tell him you said that.

1057
01:28:39,918 --> 01:28:41,044
Hello?

1058
01:28:48,885 --> 01:28:50,136
Stop where you are.

1059
01:28:52,556 --> 01:28:54,307
How did you get here?

1060
01:28:55,475 --> 01:28:56,643
By accident.

1061
01:28:58,645 --> 01:28:59,646
Who are you?

1062
01:29:00,689 --> 01:29:01,690
What are you?

1063
01:29:01,773 --> 01:29:03,858
I'm just one of us.

1064
01:29:04,109 --> 01:29:05,610
From the Multiverse?

1065
01:29:05,694 --> 01:29:06,903
That's right.

1066
01:29:08,822 --> 01:29:09,823
Prove it.

1067
01:29:13,243 --> 01:29:14,578
We had a sister.

1068
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,121
Donna.

1069
01:29:18,957 --> 01:29:20,000
But she, um...

1070
01:29:21,585 --> 01:29:23,545
She died when we were kids.

1071
01:29:25,672 --> 01:29:26,715
How?

1072
01:29:28,133 --> 01:29:33,888
We were playing on a frozen lake and, uh...

1073
01:29:37,976 --> 01:29:39,894
she fell through the ice.

1074
01:29:46,192 --> 01:29:48,028
I couldn't save her.

1075
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:51,906
Sounds about right.

1076
01:29:54,576 --> 01:29:57,037
But we don't talk about that, do we?

1077
01:29:58,371 --> 01:29:59,539
No, we don't.

1078
01:30:01,166 --> 01:30:03,877
Suppose your reality wasn't always like this.

1079
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,504
I suspect it was somewhat like yours until...

1080
01:30:06,588 --> 01:30:07,589
Until?

1081
01:30:09,549 --> 01:30:10,967
Until I lost.

1082
01:30:12,385 --> 01:30:14,012
To whom?

1083
01:30:17,557 --> 01:30:18,892
What do you want?

1084
01:30:19,643 --> 01:30:22,145
I just want to get home.

1085
01:30:22,354 --> 01:30:23,897
Yeah? Believe me,

1086
01:30:24,064 --> 01:30:26,941
I've been trying to leave this place for a long time.

1087
01:30:28,109 --> 01:30:29,444
Darkhold.

1088
01:30:29,611 --> 01:30:32,364
You guard the Darkhold in this universe?

1089
01:30:32,530 --> 01:30:33,573
Yeah.

1090
01:30:34,199 --> 01:30:35,241
For good reason.

1091
01:30:35,450 --> 01:30:36,493
That's a start.

1092
01:30:36,576 --> 01:30:37,744
I could use it.

1093
01:30:37,827 --> 01:30:39,747
It could help me to communicate with my universe.

1094
01:30:39,788 --> 01:30:40,955
Careful.

1095
01:30:41,873 --> 01:30:44,459
The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

1096
01:30:44,542 --> 01:30:47,462
I don't mean to be callous,

1097
01:30:47,545 --> 01:30:50,507
but how much of a heavier toll is there left to exact?

1098
01:30:50,590 --> 01:30:52,842
Not just on its reality.

1099
01:30:53,218 --> 01:30:54,469
On its reader.

1100
01:30:55,553 --> 01:30:57,555
Look, I'm sorry you couldn't save your universe,

1101
01:30:57,639 --> 01:31:00,183
but maybe you could help to save mine.

1102
01:31:03,269 --> 01:31:05,146
Are you happy, Stephen?

1103
01:31:06,064 --> 01:31:07,107
What?

1104
01:31:07,732 --> 01:31:12,362
Are you happy, Stephen?

1105
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,616
It's the question that...

1106
01:31:18,118 --> 01:31:19,786
Christine Palmer

1107
01:31:20,495 --> 01:31:22,247
asked me at her wedding.

1108
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:27,752
I said, "Yes, of course I'm happy.

1109
01:31:27,919 --> 01:31:30,130
"I'm a sorcerer with the power of gods.

1110
01:31:30,213 --> 01:31:33,007
"What man wouldn't be happy?"

1111
01:31:33,758 --> 01:31:38,930
And then I came back to this goddamn haunted house,

1112
01:31:39,097 --> 01:31:40,515
sat down,

1113
01:31:42,183 --> 01:31:44,394
and wondered why I'd lied.

1114
01:31:46,688 --> 01:31:49,399
I never meant for any of this to happen.

1115
01:31:51,234 --> 01:31:54,237
I was looking for a world where things were different.

1116
01:31:56,406 --> 01:31:59,909
Where I had Christine, where I was happy.

1117
01:32:02,036 --> 01:32:03,496
But I didn't find it.

1118
01:32:05,123 --> 01:32:07,292
All I found were more of us.

1119
01:32:09,252 --> 01:32:11,629
So I did those Stephens a favour.

1120
01:32:13,256 --> 01:32:16,009
You ever had that dream where you're falling

1121
01:32:16,092 --> 01:32:19,804
as if you've been pushed off a tall building?

1122
01:32:22,849 --> 01:32:24,684
That was probably me.

1123
01:32:33,193 --> 01:32:35,779
The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

1124
01:32:35,945 --> 01:32:37,405
Okay.

1125
01:32:38,323 --> 01:32:40,909
All the more reason to give it a rest and let me have it.

1126
01:32:41,075 --> 01:32:42,494
Here's the deal.

1127
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:45,455
I'll let you use the Darkhold

1128
01:32:45,538 --> 01:32:47,457
if you give me your Christine.

1129
01:32:48,208 --> 01:32:49,501
Yeah.

1130
01:32:49,667 --> 01:32:51,669
I don't think she's gonna go for that.

1131
01:32:51,836 --> 01:32:52,837
No?

1132
01:32:53,046 --> 01:32:55,298
Didn't think so.

1133
01:36:23,256 --> 01:36:24,549
Hang on, we're coming.

1134
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:32,932
What are you doing with the Darkhold?

1135
01:36:35,101 --> 01:36:37,020
Are you going to Dreamwalk?

1136
01:36:37,186 --> 01:36:39,439
It's a little bit more than just Dreamwalking.

1137
01:36:39,605 --> 01:36:41,899
All you Stranges, you're the same.

1138
01:36:42,066 --> 01:36:43,109
I know.

1139
01:36:45,194 --> 01:36:46,279
You're right.

1140
01:36:47,113 --> 01:36:48,448
We are all the same.

1141
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:50,992
But right now, that kid needs me.

1142
01:36:51,075 --> 01:36:54,746
And I can't do any of this without your help.

1143
01:36:55,621 --> 01:36:56,706
While I'm under,

1144
01:36:56,789 --> 01:36:58,249
I need you to protect my body

1145
01:36:58,332 --> 01:37:00,334
in case they attack me for trespassing.

1146
01:37:00,668 --> 01:37:01,836
Who's "they"?

1147
01:37:03,546 --> 01:37:05,798
The souls of the damned.

1148
01:37:28,029 --> 01:37:29,030
Okay.

1149
01:37:29,197 --> 01:37:33,201
But doesn't a version of you need to live in that universe,

1150
01:37:33,367 --> 01:37:35,161
so that you can Dreamwalk into them?

1151
01:37:36,829 --> 01:37:38,456
Who said they had to be living?

1152
01:38:52,488 --> 01:38:54,282
Stephen Strange,

1153
01:38:54,448 --> 01:38:57,160
possessing a dead body is forbidden.

1154
01:38:57,326 --> 01:38:58,953
Forbidden.

1155
01:38:59,036 --> 01:39:00,538
Trespasser!

1156
01:39:00,621 --> 01:39:02,165
Trespasser!

1157
01:39:03,583 --> 01:39:07,795
Cease your Dreamwalk, or face the eternal consequences.

1158
01:39:16,679 --> 01:39:17,805
Stephen!

1159
01:39:18,472 --> 01:39:20,308
They're pulling me down.

1160
01:39:21,809 --> 01:39:23,019
Stephen!

1161
01:39:30,776 --> 01:39:32,278
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

1162
01:39:33,070 --> 01:39:34,071
Where are you?

1163
01:40:00,765 --> 01:40:02,683
The Brazier of Bom'Galiath.

1164
01:40:13,361 --> 01:40:14,362
Go back to hell.

1165
01:40:26,916 --> 01:40:28,125
Stephen.

1166
01:40:29,627 --> 01:40:30,920
I've got you.

1167
01:40:32,129 --> 01:40:34,507
You're a Master of the Mystic Arts.

1168
01:40:34,924 --> 01:40:36,384
They're spirits.

1169
01:40:36,467 --> 01:40:37,510
Use them.

1170
01:40:42,807 --> 01:40:43,808
Use them.

1171
01:40:46,227 --> 01:40:47,228
Use them.

1172
01:41:03,953 --> 01:41:05,246
No!

1173
01:41:59,175 --> 01:42:00,176
Come on!

1174
01:42:05,848 --> 01:42:06,849
Uh-oh.

1175
01:42:35,086 --> 01:42:37,296
Strange!

1176
01:42:45,721 --> 01:42:47,556
Dreamwalking. You hypocrite!

1177
01:42:54,313 --> 01:42:56,273
This time, it's gonna take more than killing me

1178
01:42:56,357 --> 01:42:57,608
to kill me.

1179
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:08,494
Murderer! Murderer!

1180
01:43:21,215 --> 01:43:22,967
I don't even wanna know.

1181
01:43:36,313 --> 01:43:38,315
No!

1182
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:39,567
- No! - No!

1183
01:43:39,650 --> 01:43:41,444
She's breaking free!

1184
01:43:41,610 --> 01:43:42,945
Hold her!

1185
01:43:43,112 --> 01:43:45,531
Strange, take America's power!

1186
01:43:51,370 --> 01:43:53,080
There's no other way.

1187
01:43:54,039 --> 01:43:55,040
Yeah.

1188
01:43:55,374 --> 01:43:56,834
This is the only way.

1189
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:12,558
It's me in Other Me's body.

1190
01:44:16,312 --> 01:44:19,315
You're here to take my power, aren't you?

1191
01:44:20,316 --> 01:44:21,817
Before Wanda can.

1192
01:44:23,736 --> 01:44:24,862
It's okay.

1193
01:44:25,821 --> 01:44:27,198
I understand now.

1194
01:44:31,994 --> 01:44:34,205
No, America.

1195
01:44:34,914 --> 01:44:37,374
I've come here to tell you to trust yourself.

1196
01:44:37,541 --> 01:44:39,126
Trust your power.

1197
01:44:39,293 --> 01:44:41,295
That's how we stop her.

1198
01:44:41,962 --> 01:44:43,547
I can't control it. I...

1199
01:44:43,631 --> 01:44:45,633
Yes, you can.

1200
01:44:45,799 --> 01:44:47,259
You have been all along.

1201
01:44:48,135 --> 01:44:50,054
Every time you opened a portal,

1202
01:44:50,137 --> 01:44:52,681
you sent us exactly where we needed to go.

1203
01:44:54,517 --> 01:44:56,143
What about the first time?

1204
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:58,812
Even that led you to this moment...

1205
01:45:00,814 --> 01:45:03,484
when you're gonna kick that witch's ass.

1206
01:45:26,048 --> 01:45:27,132
I've got you.

1207
01:45:52,199 --> 01:45:53,367
Uh-huh.

1208
01:45:54,618 --> 01:45:55,911
Mm-mm-mm.

1209
01:46:17,182 --> 01:46:18,559
I can't beat you.

1210
01:46:20,603 --> 01:46:22,104
So I'll give you what you want.

1211
01:46:36,410 --> 01:46:38,495
Billy. Tommy.

1212
01:46:38,954 --> 01:46:41,290
Mommy! It's the witch!

1213
01:46:41,373 --> 01:46:42,916
What have you done?

1214
01:46:43,167 --> 01:46:44,168
- Mom! - Mommy!

1215
01:46:44,251 --> 01:46:45,461
Wait! Boys!

1216
01:46:45,544 --> 01:46:46,962
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

1217
01:46:47,129 --> 01:46:48,255
I'm your mother!

1218
01:46:50,674 --> 01:46:52,259
Get away from them.

1219
01:46:53,135 --> 01:46:54,803
Mom!

1220
01:46:55,262 --> 01:46:56,513
No.

1221
01:46:56,597 --> 01:46:57,640
Not yet.

1222
01:46:58,140 --> 01:46:59,350
Mommy!

1223
01:46:59,433 --> 01:47:01,328
- Get away from our mom! - You're not our real mom!

1224
01:47:01,352 --> 01:47:03,103
Hey, boys. Stop. Please.

1225
01:47:03,187 --> 01:47:05,040
- Please. Boys, stop it. - Get out of our house!

1226
01:47:05,064 --> 01:47:06,704
- You're not our mom! - Get out!

1227
01:47:06,815 --> 01:47:08,025
- Go away! - Go!

1228
01:47:08,108 --> 01:47:09,485
Stop it!

1229
01:47:17,785 --> 01:47:19,828
Please don't hurt us.

1230
01:47:20,204 --> 01:47:21,246
Please.

1231
01:47:22,206 --> 01:47:23,999
I would never hurt you.

1232
01:47:24,166 --> 01:47:25,167
Never.

1233
01:47:26,919 --> 01:47:29,129
I would never hurt anyone.

1234
01:47:29,296 --> 01:47:30,964
I'm not a monster.

1235
01:47:31,131 --> 01:47:32,383
I'm a...

1236
01:47:36,261 --> 01:47:37,304
I'm...

1237
01:47:44,228 --> 01:47:46,438
I'm sorry.

1238
01:47:54,488 --> 01:47:55,572
Mom!

1239
01:47:55,739 --> 01:47:57,366
- Are you okay? - Hi.

1240
01:47:58,325 --> 01:47:59,660
Hi. Okay.

1241
01:47:59,827 --> 01:48:00,828
I'm okay.

1242
01:48:01,704 --> 01:48:04,331
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1243
01:48:16,051 --> 01:48:18,011
- Mom, don't go. Don't go. - No, Mom. Don't.

1244
01:48:18,095 --> 01:48:19,221
- It's okay. - Mom.

1245
01:48:19,304 --> 01:48:21,098
It's okay. It's okay.

1246
01:49:02,055 --> 01:49:04,266
Know that they'll be loved.

1247
01:49:45,224 --> 01:49:46,225
What now?

1248
01:49:46,391 --> 01:49:47,726
Get out of here.

1249
01:49:48,477 --> 01:49:49,520
I'll find you.

1250
01:49:58,445 --> 01:50:00,197
We have to go. Now!

1251
01:50:12,668 --> 01:50:14,503
I opened the Darkhold.

1252
01:50:15,337 --> 01:50:17,506
I have to close it.

1253
01:50:20,300 --> 01:50:23,303
No one will ever be tempted by the Darkhold again.

1254
01:51:08,056 --> 01:51:09,600
You all right?

1255
01:51:10,267 --> 01:51:11,894
- Is it over? - Yeah.

1256
01:51:12,477 --> 01:51:13,812
Is America okay?

1257
01:51:13,896 --> 01:51:15,814
She's on her way here to get us.

1258
01:51:18,275 --> 01:51:19,276
Wanda?

1259
01:51:21,069 --> 01:51:22,070
No.

1260
01:51:30,495 --> 01:51:33,916
So she destroyed the Darkhold in every universe.

1261
01:51:36,877 --> 01:51:38,462
She did the right thing.

1262
01:51:40,422 --> 01:51:41,423
Yeah, she did.

1263
01:51:49,389 --> 01:51:51,266
What's your universe like?

1264
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:55,520
- It's very beautiful. - Hmm.

1265
01:51:59,816 --> 01:52:01,485
I wish I could show you.

1266
01:52:05,572 --> 01:52:06,907
I'd really like that.

1267
01:52:11,995 --> 01:52:14,498
- But I have to go. - Yeah.

1268
01:52:15,707 --> 01:52:16,959
Yeah, I know.

1269
01:52:20,712 --> 01:52:22,172
It's too bad, though.

1270
01:52:24,424 --> 01:52:26,385
Could've been one hell of an Incursion.

1271
01:52:30,055 --> 01:52:31,264
I love you.

1272
01:52:34,351 --> 01:52:37,062
I love you in every universe.

1273
01:52:41,108 --> 01:52:42,859
It's not that I don't wanna care for someone

1274
01:52:42,943 --> 01:52:44,403
or have someone care for me.

1275
01:52:44,569 --> 01:52:45,779
It's just...

1276
01:52:49,116 --> 01:52:50,492
I get scared.

1277
01:52:50,659 --> 01:52:51,660
Yeah.

1278
01:52:54,746 --> 01:52:56,164
Yeah.

1279
01:53:07,259 --> 01:53:08,468
Face your fears...

1280
01:53:11,221 --> 01:53:13,140
Doctor Strange.

1281
01:53:43,086 --> 01:53:45,213
Ay! How is this so much harder

1282
01:53:45,297 --> 01:53:46,840
than a Multiversal portal?

1283
01:53:49,009 --> 01:53:51,344
She needs to slow down and be more patient.

1284
01:53:53,096 --> 01:53:55,182
Reminds me of another student I knew.

1285
01:53:57,684 --> 01:53:59,019
How you feeling?

1286
01:53:59,644 --> 01:54:00,645
Why do you ask?

1287
01:54:02,522 --> 01:54:05,567
You used the Darkhold to Dreamwalk into your own corpse.

1288
01:54:05,650 --> 01:54:06,818
Oh.

1289
01:54:06,902 --> 01:54:08,236
Yeah, right, that.

1290
01:54:09,237 --> 01:54:10,238
Fine.

1291
01:54:12,574 --> 01:54:14,367
But I do wanna ask you something.

1292
01:54:15,827 --> 01:54:17,287
Are you happy?

1293
01:54:18,705 --> 01:54:20,457
That's a, um,

1294
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:21,750
interesting question.

1295
01:54:23,418 --> 01:54:26,171
You'd think that saving the world would get you there,

1296
01:54:26,838 --> 01:54:28,048
but it doesn't.

1297
01:54:31,426 --> 01:54:35,514
Sometimes, I do wonder about my other lives.

1298
01:54:36,890 --> 01:54:39,351
Yet I remain grateful in this one.

1299
01:54:40,352 --> 01:54:42,145
Even with its tribulations.

1300
01:54:44,147 --> 01:54:46,817
At least we don't have to go through it alone, huh?

1301
01:54:46,983 --> 01:54:48,068
No, we don't.

1302
01:54:55,534 --> 01:54:56,576
Hmm.

1303
01:54:59,329 --> 01:55:01,206
Wait.

1304
01:55:03,542 --> 01:55:04,584
'Sup?

1305
01:55:04,751 --> 01:55:05,752
'Sup.

1306
01:55:07,379 --> 01:55:08,380
Made some sparks.

1307
01:55:09,005 --> 01:55:10,006
Great.

1308
01:55:10,632 --> 01:55:12,134
Your parents would be proud.

1309
01:55:12,217 --> 01:55:14,302
I hope you'll get to show 'em one day.

1310
01:55:15,428 --> 01:55:16,471
Stephen.

1311
01:55:21,101 --> 01:55:23,395
I'm glad I fell into your universe.

1312
01:55:25,355 --> 01:55:26,648
So am I, kid.

1313
01:55:28,316 --> 01:55:30,026
So am I.

1314
01:56:05,145 --> 01:56:06,146
Hmm.

1315
01:58:55,732 --> 01:58:57,067
Doctor Strange?

1316
01:59:00,487 --> 01:59:01,654
Can I help you?

1317
01:59:02,322 --> 01:59:03,782
You caused an Incursion,

1318
01:59:03,948 --> 01:59:05,575
and we're gonna fix it.

1319
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:15,710
Unless you're afraid.

1320
01:59:20,590 --> 01:59:21,883
Not in the least.

1321
02:06:13,419 --> 02:06:14,629
It's over!
