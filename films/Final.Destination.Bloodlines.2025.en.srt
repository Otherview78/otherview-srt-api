00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:32,633
-What was that?
-Nothing.

2
00:00:32,717 --> 00:00:34,499
Okay, just give me
one little hint.

3
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:35,676
No. No hints.

4
00:00:35,806 --> 00:00:36,974
We're almost there.

5
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:38,388
Okay, I'm going
to take this off.

6
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:39,895
No, no, no. Hey, you
said you like surprises.

7
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:42,077
Yeah, I do. When I
know what they are.

8
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:43,892
You're going to love it.

9
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:45,316
Promise.

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,610

Okay. Move forward. Stop.

00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:22,020

I pulled some favors

00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,711
and I got us on the
list for opening night.

Wow. Uh...

00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,567

Don't steal coins

It's bad luck.

We'll take the next one.

00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:53,768
Thanks.

00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:01,409
Going up.

50
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:11,295
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.

51
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,192
It does that sometimes.

52
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:33,484
Some fun facts about
the Sky View Tower.

53
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:37,780
It's 494 feet tall and
weighs over 9,000 tons.

54
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:39,115
It's made of steel

55
00:03:39,198 --> 00:03:41,659
and reinforced
concrete and glass.

56
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:44,370
And even more impressive,
the entire project

57
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:47,124
was completed five
months ahead of schedule.

58
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:49,673
Is that a good thing?

59
00:04:33,377 --> 00:04:34,606
Wow.

60
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:36,570
What did I tell you?

61
00:04:37,757 --> 00:04:39,958
-Fancy.
-Yes?

62
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,653
May I help you?

63
00:04:41,737 --> 00:04:42,903
We have a reservation.

64
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,030
Campbell.

65
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,559
Oh, I'm sorry,

66
00:04:48,643 --> 00:04:51,854
but we're already over
capacity for opening night.

67
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:53,397
We cannot accommodate you.

68
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:54,941
If you wouldn't mind
just stepping aside.

69
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:55,983
-Thank you so much.
-It's okay.

70
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:58,319
I worked it out with Jake.

71
00:04:58,402 --> 00:04:59,571
Is he here? I
could speak with...

72
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:03,032
We let Jake go this morning.

73
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:04,283
Thank you so much.

74
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:05,410
-Uh, are you...
-What's going on?

75
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:07,620
One second, one second. Um...

76
00:05:07,703 --> 00:05:09,413
Sir, I know you're a
very important man,

77
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:11,165
um, but maybe you
could help me out...

78
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:15,866
Please.

79
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,755
You're tearing me apart.

80
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,340
But I'm sorry, I can't help you.

81
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:20,800
Now, if you wouldn't mind...

82
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:23,761
Oh, Mr. Fuller! How
nice to see you.

83
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,596
We have a lovely table for you.

84
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,038
Thank you. This way, please.

85
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,479
-Let's go to the bar.
-What?

86
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,275
Just act natural.

87
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,190
Wow.

88
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:43,133
Wow. Look at that view.

89
00:05:53,082 --> 00:05:55,141
-Mmm-hmm.
-What?

90
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:57,367
Oh, no.

91
00:05:58,504 --> 00:05:59,757
-You're scared of heights.
-What?

92
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,752
Oh, no. I'm just...

93
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:05,178
I've just never been
this high up before.

94
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:08,420
I'm so sorry. This night's
turning into such a disaster.

95
00:06:08,504 --> 00:06:09,690
I really wanted
it to be perfect.

I don't know, exactly.

Maybe one or two months.

133
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:17,601
That's wonderful news.

134
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:20,688
Isn't it?

135
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:25,276

-Thank you.
-Of course.

140
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,617
-Bye.

141
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:44,895
Okay.

00:08:45,713 --> 00:08:48,591
Oh. There you are.

143
00:08:48,674 --> 00:08:49,967
Are you okay?

144
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:51,793
Yeah.

145
00:08:51,877 --> 00:08:53,185
I think so.

146
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:55,302

147
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:56,637

148
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:17,729

-I wanted to...

00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:21,135

Okay.

151
00:09:23,704 --> 00:09:24,830
Um...

152
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,920
I was going to do
this at dinner,

153
00:09:28,003 --> 00:09:30,213
but seeing as we
have this view...

154
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:35,930
Hey! Don't throw that penny.

155
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:37,172
It could kill somebody.

156
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,475
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Of course. Yeah.

157
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:42,478
Fat ass.

158
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,567
Um, these past few years...

159
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,635
have been absolutely magical.

160
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:53,975
And that's, uh...

161
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:55,551
that's because of you.

162
00:09:57,368 --> 00:10:00,579
Iris, I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.

163
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:07,550
You mean...

164
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:10,239
with us?

165
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:14,621
What?

166
00:10:16,494 --> 00:10:17,661
Sorry.

167
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,483
I...

168
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:26,563
I'm the luckiest
guy in the world.

169
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:27,647
What?

170
00:10:28,113 --> 00:10:28,955
You're not upset?

171
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,585
Are you kidding me?
No, this... this is...

172
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:33,262
-This is incredible.
-Really?

173
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:34,915
We're going to start a family.

174
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:39,105

175
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:40,904

176
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,615
Oh, uh... Yes.

177
00:10:51,758 --> 00:10:53,009
Mmm. Uh...

178
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:56,331

No! Stay back!

-Wait! Help!

00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:49,546
Paul! Grab my hand!

242
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,499
No!

243
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:53,801
No!

244
00:14:33,826 --> 00:14:35,657
Everyone down the stairs!

245
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:44,227
Out of my way Children first!

246
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:46,229
Single file!

247
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,764
Oh, my God!

248
00:15:01,591 --> 00:15:03,095
To the elevator!

249
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:10,242
Excuse me, ma'am.

250
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,217
Please. I need to
get to the controls.

251
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:17,446
Move!

252
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,513
Let me in.

253
00:15:18,597 --> 00:15:22,550
Please, sir. Step back!
We're already over capacity!

254
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:24,322
I swear to God, move!

255
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:26,157
Let me in!

256
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:26,452
Help, please! Please!

257
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:29,472
Grab on! Grab on!

258
00:17:50,464 --> 00:17:53,099
Help! Help!

259
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:02,465
Hey.

260
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:03,937
Come here.

261
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:51,681
Well, I realize vector
multiplication is scary,

262
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:53,412
but it's not that scary.

263
00:18:54,664 --> 00:18:56,296
All right, that's it for today.

264
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,590
We'll start prepping
for the final next week.

265
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,518
Ms. Reyes.

266
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:08,674
We need to talk.

267
00:19:11,389 --> 00:19:12,390
Yeah.

268
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:19,238
We're going to start a family.

269
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:21,867
Don't throw that penny.
It could kill somebody.

270
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:23,711
Everyone down the stairs!

271
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:34,318
Oh, this dream is
ruining my life.

272
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:36,603
Mine, too.

273
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:38,940
Every night, Stef.

274
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:40,484
God, I'm not getting any sleep.

275
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:42,405
Shit, I'm sorry.

276
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:45,859
Um, can I tell you something?

277
00:19:47,511 --> 00:19:49,930
Yeah, what's up?

278
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:53,596
So, the woman in my dream.
Her name is Iris, right?

279
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,541
Okay.

280
00:19:55,689 --> 00:19:57,232
That was my grandmother's name.

281
00:19:57,316 --> 00:20:00,918
I think I'm dreaming about her.

282
00:20:01,002 --> 00:20:02,041
Are you serious?

283
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,334
Yeah. The thing is,
I never even met her.

284
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:06,053
I don't even know
if she's alive.

285
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:07,847
Okay, well...

286
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:11,220
either go home and
find out about Grandma

287
00:20:11,304 --> 00:20:12,764
and hope that stops the dreams.

288
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:17,037
Or stay here and die
in your sleep for real.

289
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:19,862
Because I will murder you.

290
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:21,656
I'm sorry.

291
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,451
-Yeah, yeah, okay.
-Love you.

292
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:26,495
Yeah. Love you, too.

293
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:28,206
-Go home.
-Yeah.

294
00:20:28,815 --> 00:20:29,968
Quietly.

295
00:20:43,628 --> 00:20:44,712
Mmm.

296
00:20:44,796 --> 00:20:46,181
Okay. Mmm!

297
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:02,863
Okay.

298
00:21:04,136 --> 00:21:05,762
Hey, there she is!

299
00:21:05,846 --> 00:21:07,931
-Hey, Dad.
-Welcome home, sweetie.

300
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:09,349
So glad you're here.

301
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:10,852
-Yeah, me, too.
-I missed you so much.

302
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:12,145
I know.

303
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,669
Oh, so great to see you.

304
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:16,047
-Thank you, thank you.
-Let me take that for you.

305
00:21:16,131 --> 00:21:19,301
Hey, sorry. Charlie took
your room a while ago,

306
00:21:19,385 --> 00:21:21,432
and my files are in his room,

307
00:21:21,516 --> 00:21:23,741
so I made up the
pullout for you.

308
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:24,454
Is that okay?

309
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:26,623
Yeah, yeah. No, that
sounds totally fine.

310
00:21:27,226 --> 00:21:30,979
Uh, hey, do we still have
that box of Mom's old stuff?

311
00:21:31,063 --> 00:21:35,359
It had, uh, some photos,
like an address book

312
00:21:35,536 --> 00:21:36,662
with phone numbers in it.

313
00:21:36,746 --> 00:21:38,205
Uh, why do you want that?

314
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:39,225
Oh, it's not a big deal.

315
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:41,987
I just thought I saw it
lying around here somewhere.

316
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:45,481
Stefani, what's going on?

317
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:50,594
Okay, this is going to
sound really, really weird,

318
00:21:50,678 --> 00:21:52,346
but I, uh...

319
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,932
I just need to find
Mom's mom, Iris.

320
00:21:58,774 --> 00:22:02,320
Uh... okay. Yeah,
that is weird.

321
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,364
And, you know, I got
rid of those boxes

322
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,679
years ago, after your mom left.

323
00:22:07,435 --> 00:22:08,896
Oh, hi, Charlie.

324
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:10,074
Hey.

325
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:15,281
Um, "Hi, Stef. How are you?
It's so nice to see you."

326
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,258
Yeah, sure.

327
00:22:17,342 --> 00:22:19,136
Uh, I'm going to the cousins.

328
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,170
Whoa. Now? Look, your
sister just got home.

329
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:23,177
-I thought we...
-Well, I had plans.

330
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:24,764
Actually, you know
what? I can drive you.

331
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:26,762
I was wanting to
see them anyways.

332
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:27,948
It's fine.

333
00:22:28,032 --> 00:22:30,159
Hey. If you're going
to see your cousins,

334
00:22:30,243 --> 00:22:32,594
please don't talk about
Iris to Uncle Howard.

335
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:35,240
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

336
00:22:35,324 --> 00:22:36,700
All right.

337
00:22:36,784 --> 00:22:38,890
-Bye. Love you.
-Love you, too.

338
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:41,019
Charlie?

339
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:44,713
Charlie... Can you just...

340
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,423
-Ow. Stef!
-...take these out, please?

341
00:22:46,507 --> 00:22:48,425
I'm trying to talk to
you. What's your problem?

342
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:49,824
What?

343
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:53,003
You haven't said anything
this entire time.

344
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:54,527
Wha...

345
00:22:55,612 --> 00:22:57,030
Stef, why are you here?

346
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:59,491
I mean, you only come
home for holidays.

347
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:01,535
Okay, I have to
tell you something.

348
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:03,662
But you have to promise
not to tell Dad.

349
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:06,429
What, are you pregnant?

350
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:08,759
No, I'm not pregnant, Charlie.

351
00:23:08,843 --> 00:23:10,485
-I don't know.
-Why would you even...

352
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:12,154
That's not... I mean,
you're in college.

353
00:23:12,238 --> 00:23:14,527
Okay, can you just promise
me you won't tell Dad?

354
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:17,534
-Why would I tell Dad?
-It's serious, Charlie.

355
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:19,598
All right.

356
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,406
Okay. Um...

357
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:32,523
I am on academic probation.

358
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,498
Whoa.

359
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,957
What? Charlie, stop laughing!
If I don't get my grades up...

360
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,192
-It's kind of a big moment for me.
-Stop!

361
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:44,611
This is kind of funny.

362
00:23:44,695 --> 00:23:46,015
-Straight A's.
-I'm trying to have a...

363
00:23:46,098 --> 00:23:47,401
You're a class president.

364
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:48,883
-Miss Valedictorian is failing out of school.
-Charlie, it's not funny.

365
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:52,395
If I don't get my grades up,
I will lose my scholarship.

366
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,555
Oh.

367
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,356
-That blows. Sorry.
-Mmm-hmm.

368
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:58,705
What happened?

369
00:23:58,823 --> 00:24:00,533
I mean, I can't sleep.

370
00:24:00,617 --> 00:24:01,653
Every time I close my eyes,

371
00:24:01,736 --> 00:24:06,153
I have this same recurring
nightmare about Iris.

372
00:24:06,842 --> 00:24:08,956
Our grandmother. I don't...

373
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:11,981
I mean, it has to
mean something.

374
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:13,275
I don't know.

375
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,150
I dream weird things.

376
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:19,279
I dreamed a hot dog
ate me last night.

377
00:24:19,363 --> 00:24:21,407
-What? That is...
-Like the hot dog was eating me.

378
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:23,812
Okay.

379
00:24:27,941 --> 00:24:30,121
Dude, can you just do something?

380
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:31,457
Dude, calm down, all right?

381
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:32,687
-We'll find him.
-Just move a little bit.

382
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,807
I can't pause, all right?

383
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:35,019
It's an online match.
Are you serious?

384
00:24:35,102 --> 00:24:36,041
I have to look under this.

385
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,342
Can you do me a
kindness? Fuck off.

386
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:38,384
You remember what
happened last time?

387
00:24:38,468 --> 00:24:39,719
It's a ranked match!

388
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:41,471
-What's going on?
-I can't find Paco.

389
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:43,390
Dude, again?

390
00:24:43,474 --> 00:24:45,060
-When was the last time you saw him?
-Wait, who's Paco?

391
00:24:45,143 --> 00:24:47,816
No way! Hey, cuz!

392
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:49,842
Oh, my gosh. Hey,
can you help us look?

393
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:51,950
And just watch your feet,
where you're stepping.

394
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:53,059
Yeah, yeah, sure.

395
00:24:53,143 --> 00:24:55,372
I just... I got to
talk to your dad first.

396
00:24:55,456 --> 00:24:56,709
What the fuck you doing home?

397
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:59,044
Oh, dude, she's
flunking out of school.

398
00:24:59,128 --> 00:25:01,720
-Charlie.
-Hey, welcome to the club.

399
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:03,514
Erik, dude, have
you looked anywhere?

400
00:25:03,598 --> 00:25:05,516
Paco's not upstairs!

401
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,206
-Oh. But look who's down here.
-Hey, Julia.

402
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,501
-Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry...
-How you been?

403
00:25:09,584 --> 00:25:11,597
-Charlie!
-Jules.

404
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:13,099
There's my little Romeo.

405
00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:15,644
So, wait, how did the
promposal with Jenny go?

406
00:25:15,728 --> 00:25:17,980
-Dude, she said yes.
-Oh, my God. Stop.

407
00:25:18,064 --> 00:25:20,757
-Okay, wait.
-Who's, uh... Who's Jenny?

408
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:23,723
Oh, he met her in
junior lifeguards.

409
00:25:23,807 --> 00:25:24,975
Junior lifeguards?

410
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:26,272
Charlie, I didn't...

411
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:27,941
I didn't know you were
doing junior lifeguards.

412
00:25:28,024 --> 00:25:29,860
-You didn't tell me that.
-Okay, so what are you going to wear?

413
00:25:29,943 --> 00:25:32,278
Uh, I'm just going
to keep it simple.

414
00:25:32,362 --> 00:25:33,967
-You know, black blazer.
-Okay.

415
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:36,942
-But with, like, a fun bowtie.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

416
00:25:39,481 --> 00:25:41,757
Stef! Stefani!

417
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:43,581
Oh, my gosh!

418
00:25:43,665 --> 00:25:45,333
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, Aunt Brenda.

419
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:46,877
-How long are you here for?
-Uh, not long.

420
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,628
Is Uncle Howard around?

421
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:50,588
Yeah. Yeah, he's out
back. I'll get him.

422
00:25:52,548 --> 00:25:54,823
Howard! Stefani's
here. Come in!

423
00:25:54,907 --> 00:25:57,326
Great!

424
00:25:57,804 --> 00:25:59,722
You look a little tired.
Is everything okay?

425
00:25:59,806 --> 00:26:02,141
-Oh.
-Stefi! Look at you!

426
00:26:02,225 --> 00:26:03,601
-Hey!
-Come here, come here.

427
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:05,144
Oh, sweetie.

428
00:26:05,228 --> 00:26:07,333
Oh, so good to see you.
Hey, are you hungry?

429
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:08,461
I was just about
to make some lunch.

430
00:26:08,544 --> 00:26:09,649
No, actually.

431
00:26:09,732 --> 00:26:11,109
I came here because I
wanted to talk to you

432
00:26:11,192 --> 00:26:13,767
about your mother, Iris.

433
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:15,571
I know you don't like
to talk about her...

434
00:26:15,655 --> 00:26:16,656
There's not much to tell.

435
00:26:16,739 --> 00:26:18,032
Hey, kids, come on, lunch!

436
00:26:18,116 --> 00:26:20,576
It's just that I've
been having this

437
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,162
recurring nightmare about her.

438
00:26:23,246 --> 00:26:25,373
Oh, honey. It's
probably just stress.

439
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:27,136
You should try melatonin.

440
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,543
Okay, but the weird thing is

441
00:26:28,626 --> 00:26:30,586
I've been dreaming
about a real place

442
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,676
from 50 years ago.

443
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,092
It was, like, a restaurant
called the Sky View.

444
00:26:38,158 --> 00:26:39,654
You know what it is.

445
00:26:39,738 --> 00:26:41,573
Did... did Iris tell
you about it? Uh...

446
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:44,191
What did she say?
Did she say anything?

447
00:26:44,275 --> 00:26:45,734
Maybe if I could talk to her...

448
00:26:45,818 --> 00:26:47,061
Talk to who?

449
00:26:47,145 --> 00:26:48,855
Oh, Stef is dreaming
about Grandma Iris.

450
00:26:48,938 --> 00:26:51,149
-Ooh, Psycho Granny?
-I thought she was dead.

451
00:26:51,232 --> 00:26:53,484
Well, she's dead to us.

452
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,820
Yeah, Stefi, Iris Campbell

453
00:26:55,903 --> 00:26:58,114
is a very deeply disturbed
woman. End of story.

454
00:26:58,197 --> 00:27:00,158
Look, if I could just
talk to her, then maybe...

455
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:01,701
maybe I can get
these dreams to stop.

456
00:27:01,784 --> 00:27:03,202
Stef, just drop it.

457
00:27:03,286 --> 00:27:04,996
I don't get it. What
happened that was so bad?

458
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,164
For one thing, she's the reason

459
00:27:06,247 --> 00:27:07,524
that your mother
is so screwed up.

460
00:27:07,607 --> 00:27:09,537
-What?
-Look, I just don't want to talk about this anymore, okay?

461
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,002
Uncle Howard, please.
I just need to know.

462
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:14,739
Look, Stefi.

463
00:27:16,716 --> 00:27:18,402
After our father died...

464
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:22,638
Iris just... snapped.

465
00:27:22,722 --> 00:27:24,558
She... she wouldn't
let us go to school.

466
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,684
She locked us inside the house.

467
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:29,187
She obsessed about
all the horrific ways

468
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,438
we could die.

469
00:27:30,521 --> 00:27:32,565
And eventually it got so bad,

470
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:34,320
I mean, so bad...

471
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:36,152
that the State came in

472
00:27:36,235 --> 00:27:38,276
and they took your mother
and I away from her.

473
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:40,239
But it didn't end there.

474
00:27:40,323 --> 00:27:41,949
She tracked us all
through foster care,

475
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:43,993
and when the kids were born,

476
00:27:44,077 --> 00:27:46,871
she started sending us
these horrible letters

477
00:27:46,954 --> 00:27:48,456
that were full of obituaries

478
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,625
and these disturbing
pictures of dead bodies.

479
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:53,727
We had to move so she
couldn't contact us anymore.

480
00:27:55,186 --> 00:27:56,746
So, uh...

481
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:01,010
Do you still have any of
those letters, though?

482
00:28:02,969 --> 00:28:04,096
I...

483
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,223
Stefi...

484
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:07,975
Listen to me.

485
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:11,566
That woman is a sick
and dangerous person.

486
00:28:12,188 --> 00:28:14,841
And for your well-being
and your safety...

487
00:28:15,274 --> 00:28:16,900
stay the hell away from her.

488
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:24,534
I found Paco!

489
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:26,202
Mmm! Thank God!

490
00:28:26,285 --> 00:28:28,371
I'm sure he'd love to be in
the living room right now.

491
00:28:28,454 --> 00:28:30,165
-Wait, in here?
-He was in the pantry.

492
00:28:30,248 --> 00:28:31,416
-Come on, guys. Let's go.
-Chill, bro.

493
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:33,077
How did he even get in there?

494
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:35,367
I need you to help me.

495
00:28:36,838 --> 00:28:39,549
You heard your uncle.
Just let it go.

496
00:28:39,632 --> 00:28:41,206
Just let it go.

497
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:43,580
You don't understand.

498
00:28:43,803 --> 00:28:46,430
My whole life is falling
apart because of this dream.

499
00:28:46,514 --> 00:28:48,349
And not only that,
I feel like...

500
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:49,892
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

501
00:28:49,976 --> 00:28:52,019
Please, you are the only
person who can help me.

502
00:28:52,103 --> 00:28:53,312
Howard would never forgive me

503
00:28:53,396 --> 00:28:55,106
if I put you in touch with Iris.

504
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:57,037
Please.

505
00:29:03,739 --> 00:29:04,949
Whatever you do,

506
00:29:05,032 --> 00:29:07,660
do not look in the bottom drawer

507
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:10,097
of the dining room cabinet.

508
00:30:48,052 --> 00:30:49,845
Hi. Um...

509
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:52,316
I'm here to see Iris Campbell.

510
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,100
Did you not see the signs?

511
00:30:54,183 --> 00:30:56,679
Uh... Uh, yeah.
Yes, I did, but...

512
00:30:56,763 --> 00:30:59,849
Then get the fuck out
of here! No visitors.

513
00:31:00,046 --> 00:31:01,399
I'm your granddaughter.

514
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:03,216
Stefani.

515
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:07,743
Empty your pockets.

516
00:31:07,827 --> 00:31:10,163
Phone, keys, everything.

517
00:31:10,247 --> 00:31:12,008
I'm not dangerous.

518
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:14,354
It's not you I'm afraid of.

519
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,100
Uh...

520
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:34,191
Come in slowly.

521
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:56,662
Shut the door.
Quick, quick, quick!

522
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:00,820
Don't move.

523
00:33:07,795 --> 00:33:09,168
Oh, my God.

524
00:33:10,604 --> 00:33:12,063
It really is you.

525
00:33:14,717 --> 00:33:16,593
I can see your mother in you.

526
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,082
Hi. I'm Stefani...

527
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:23,627
Stop! Stop. Don't move.

528
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,250
Not until I tell you.

529
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:30,262
Trying to trick
me, aren't you?

530
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:33,281
Getting me to let
my guard down.

531
00:33:34,683 --> 00:33:36,133
There you go. Come on.

532
00:33:37,144 --> 00:33:39,268
Come here. Sit.

533
00:33:40,497 --> 00:33:42,692
-Okay, um...
-Sit.

534
00:33:43,904 --> 00:33:45,087
That's it.

535
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:49,576
So... how is Darlene?

536
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,829
-Your mom okay?
-Oh. Uh...

537
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:53,665
No. I don't know.

538
00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:56,126
She, uh... She
left when I was 10,

539
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,880
so we don't... we
don't see her anymore.

540
00:33:58,964 --> 00:33:59,965
Oh.

541
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:06,357
But you saw my letters.
That's why you're here, right?

542
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:08,484
No. Um...

543
00:34:09,428 --> 00:34:10,805
I'm actually here because

544
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,975
I've been dreaming
about the Sky View.

545
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:15,561
-What?
-Yeah.

546
00:34:15,645 --> 00:34:17,356
Yeah, every single night
for the past two months.

547
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:19,400
It's the same dream.

548
00:34:19,484 --> 00:34:21,194
In it, you're on a date,

549
00:34:21,278 --> 00:34:22,946
but then the dance floor breaks,

550
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,533
and there's an explosion
and then you...

551
00:34:25,617 --> 00:34:27,452
Fall. And die.

552
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:29,788
Yeah. Yeah, everyone dies.

553
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:32,421
It wasn't just your dream.

554
00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:35,016
It was my premonition.

555
00:34:35,795 --> 00:34:38,071
Years ago, at the Sky View...

556
00:34:38,155 --> 00:34:40,752
I got a glimpse into the future

557
00:34:40,836 --> 00:34:42,588
and saw what Death
was about to do.

558
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:49,305
I was going to do
this at dinner,

559
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,022
but seeing as we
have this view...

560
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,278
Hey! Don't throw that penny.

561
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:57,613
It could kill somebody.

562
00:34:57,697 --> 00:34:59,199
Oh, I'm so sorry. Of course.

563
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:00,789
Fat ass.

564
00:35:00,873 --> 00:35:03,196
These past few years have
been absolutely magical.

565
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,033
And that's all because of you.

566
00:35:06,117 --> 00:35:07,243
No, no, no. I...

567
00:35:08,852 --> 00:35:10,103
This isn't right. I...

568
00:35:10,187 --> 00:35:11,534
Is that a no?

569
00:35:12,787 --> 00:35:14,497
Everyone's going to die.

570
00:35:14,581 --> 00:35:16,784
No, the whole building
is going to come down.

571
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:18,495
Are you serious?

572
00:35:20,007 --> 00:35:21,676
-The penny.
-Iris?

573
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,428
-Give me that!
-What the hell, lady?

574
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:25,425
-Give it to me!
-What are you doing?

575
00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:27,892
What the fuck is wrong with you?

576
00:35:27,976 --> 00:35:32,063

577
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:33,292

Stop playing! Stop playing!

587
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:52,160
Everyone needs to get
off the dance floor!

588
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:54,226
The glass is about to break.

589
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,688
-Everyone needs to get off now!
-Ma'am.

590
00:35:55,771 --> 00:35:56,855
Wait! No!

591
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:58,232
Get off the dance floor!

592
00:35:58,316 --> 00:36:00,068
-Iris!
-You need to get off!

593
00:36:00,209 --> 00:36:01,627
Get off!

594
00:36:05,974 --> 00:36:08,830
I saved a lot of
lives that night.

595
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:11,292
Lives that were never
meant to be saved.

596
00:36:12,554 --> 00:36:15,108
They closed the
restaurant after that.

597
00:36:15,192 --> 00:36:19,238
Said it needed
additional renovations.

598
00:36:19,391 --> 00:36:21,310
But it never reopened.

599
00:36:21,394 --> 00:36:23,146
Eventually they tore it down.

600
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,676
Wait, so you stopped
the disaster.

601
00:36:26,512 --> 00:36:27,638
Yes.

602
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:34,319
But Death doesn't like it
when you fuck with his plans.

603
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:36,441
So, over the years, he came back

604
00:36:36,525 --> 00:36:39,026
and he killed everyone
who was there that night.

605
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,834
Including my Paul.

606
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,940
Wait a minute. I'm
sorry. Did you...

607
00:36:45,024 --> 00:36:46,875
Did you say Death came back?

608
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:49,586
He's a relentless
son of a bitch.

609
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,360
Won't stop until he
finishes the job.

610
00:36:51,444 --> 00:36:53,959
But I taught myself
how to see him coming.

611
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:57,011
To anticipate his every move.

612
00:36:57,095 --> 00:37:00,000
I've been keeping him
at bay for years now.

613
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,229
But now he's got me. Cancer.

614
00:37:03,313 --> 00:37:04,514
Oh. Uh...

615
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,649
-Believe that shit?
-Sorry.

616
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:09,359
Got the diagnosis
two months ago.

617
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:11,320
Wait, that's when I
started having my dream.

618
00:37:11,404 --> 00:37:12,947
See? It's a sign.

619
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:16,044
Okay, but why am I dreaming
about what you saw?

620
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:18,345
Maybe my cancer passed
my premonition onto you.

621
00:37:18,429 --> 00:37:20,931
Maybe it's fate's
demented sense of humor.

622
00:37:21,015 --> 00:37:22,155
Who the hell knows?

623
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:25,160
What matters is that
when the universe speaks,

624
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,227
you pay attention.

625
00:37:39,086 --> 00:37:40,647
I see you, you fuck.

626
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:47,494
Um, who...

627
00:37:47,578 --> 00:37:49,527
-Who are you talking to?
-Death.

628
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,566
He thinks I'm distracted
because you're here.

629
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:55,708
I have to teach you
everything in this book.

630
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:58,503
It'll take some time
to learn the basics,

631
00:37:58,587 --> 00:38:00,255
-so you'll need to stay here.
-Stay here?

632
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:01,757
The outside world
is too dangerous.

633
00:38:01,841 --> 00:38:03,927
I haven't stepped out
there in 20 years.

634
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:06,295
In here, we can be safe.

635
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:08,828
Oh.

636
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:10,009
See that?

637
00:38:10,093 --> 00:38:11,469
Yeah.

638
00:38:11,553 --> 00:38:13,138
This is all my research.

639
00:38:13,222 --> 00:38:14,891
My life's work.

640
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:16,935
Look, I'm... I'm
sorry. I can't...

641
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:18,196
I can't stay here.

642
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,074
I... I have to get
back to school,

643
00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:22,244
but, you know, I'll come
back and I'll visit.

644
00:38:22,328 --> 00:38:25,123
No, I'm sick! I won't
be alive that long.

645
00:38:25,207 --> 00:38:26,583
You can't leave.

646
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:28,377
Don't you see?

647
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:31,506
Death is coming for our family.

648
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,926
Uh...

649
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:35,917
You don't believe me.

650
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:37,336
No. Uh... um...

651
00:38:37,617 --> 00:38:40,010
Uh, I think I made a mistake.

652
00:38:40,094 --> 00:38:42,888
I think it was
probably just a dream.

653
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:45,204
No, wait. At least
take the book.

654
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:46,533
Stefani!

655
00:38:47,195 --> 00:38:48,317
Stefani!

656
00:39:11,823 --> 00:39:14,126
Stefani! Stop!

657
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:17,281
Look, I'm sorry. I
shouldn't have come here.

658
00:39:17,611 --> 00:39:19,780
This book is a lifeline.

659
00:39:19,864 --> 00:39:21,523
It will show you
everything you need to know

660
00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:22,937
to keep our family safe.

661
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,380
You still don't believe me.

662
00:39:31,198 --> 00:39:32,199
Step back.

663
00:39:32,283 --> 00:39:33,659
What? Why?

664
00:39:35,736 --> 00:39:37,363
Seeing is believing.

665
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,690
Hey, Stef. Her face really
explode right in front of you?

666
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,442
-Is that like... I'm...
-Erik!

667
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,611
Just leave her alone.

668
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,631
It's my bad, Stef.
I'm just curious.

669
00:40:09,244 --> 00:40:12,706
Hey. How are you holding up?

670
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:16,066
I'm sorry, Uncle Howard.

671
00:40:17,469 --> 00:40:18,846
You were right about Iris.

672
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,534
I never... I never
should've went there.

673
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,870
Honey, there's no
need to apologize.

674
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:26,117
I'm so sorry you had
to go through that.

675
00:40:29,985 --> 00:40:31,612
She said something to
me before she died.

676
00:40:31,702 --> 00:40:33,408
She said Death was
coming for our family.

677
00:40:33,492 --> 00:40:34,827
That's...

678
00:40:34,911 --> 00:40:36,320
That's crazy, right?

679
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:37,760
Oh, my God.

680
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:40,086
I can't believe it.

681
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,108
I emailed her.

682
00:40:41,192 --> 00:40:43,118
I just didn't think
she'd show up. I...

683
00:40:43,867 --> 00:40:44,868
Come on.

684
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:54,484
Is that, um...

685
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:57,020
Is that Mom?

686
00:40:58,342 --> 00:40:59,343
Yeah.

687
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:06,320
Darlene!

688
00:41:08,207 --> 00:41:10,292
-Wow.
-Um...

689
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:12,929
I can come back.

690
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:14,848
Oh, don't be
ridiculous. Come on.

691
00:41:15,212 --> 00:41:16,565
Get down here. Come here.

692
00:41:20,496 --> 00:41:22,216
Think she'll come
to the barbecue?

693
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:26,955
Stef. Hey, wait up.

694
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:28,927
If she's going to Uncle
Howard's house, then I'm not.

695
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,104
You can get a ride with Dad.

696
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,513
Uh... You're not even
going to talk to her?

697
00:41:32,596 --> 00:41:33,806
Come on.

698
00:41:33,889 --> 00:41:35,497
You don't remember
her like I do.

699
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:36,874
Just give her a chance.

700
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:38,835
Why? Charlie, she abandoned us,

701
00:41:38,919 --> 00:41:41,687
and now she rolls in here
after all these years

702
00:41:41,771 --> 00:41:43,610
and wants to act like
nothing happened?

703
00:41:45,568 --> 00:41:46,898
Yeah.

704
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:48,911
Because who would
do that, right?

705
00:41:49,315 --> 00:41:50,358
Wait. What?

706
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:51,886
-Nothing. Forget it.
-No.

707
00:41:52,941 --> 00:41:54,776
No. What's that
supposed to mean?

708
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,529
I tried calling you so
many times, and nothing.

709
00:41:57,613 --> 00:41:59,199
Same with Julia. You
used to be best friends.

710
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:00,408
You don't even talk anymore.

711
00:42:00,492 --> 00:42:03,162
Okay, I'm sorry, I...

712
00:42:03,246 --> 00:42:05,373
I've just been distracted
the last couple of months

713
00:42:05,457 --> 00:42:06,467
because of this nightmare.

714
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,539
Okay, but what
about before that?

715
00:42:07,623 --> 00:42:09,352
It's been like this
ever since you left.

716
00:42:10,705 --> 00:42:13,166
You're mad at Mom, but you
haven't been around either.

717
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,568
I'm not like her!

718
00:42:15,497 --> 00:42:16,498
Okay?

719
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:19,175
I'm not crazy.

720
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:23,279
Yeah, you're right.

721
00:42:23,702 --> 00:42:24,858
You're not crazy.

722
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:27,588

Hey, hey!

736
00:44:15,334 --> 00:44:17,847
Come here. So glad you made it.

737
00:44:19,112 --> 00:44:20,865
You know, I didn't think you
were actually going to come.

738
00:44:20,948 --> 00:44:22,408
Thank you for inviting me.

739
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:23,826
Of course. Come on in.

740
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,951
Hey, everybody! Come
on! Come on over!

741
00:44:27,454 --> 00:44:29,397
-I made cookies.
-That's great!

742
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:32,700
-Can I try one?
-Yes, of course.

743
00:44:38,373 --> 00:44:39,710
Does this have peanut butter?

744
00:44:39,794 --> 00:44:40,794
Yeah.

745
00:44:43,655 --> 00:44:45,749
Are you trying to
kill my brother?

746
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:48,375
-Oh, my God. Bobby's allergic.
-Yeah.

747
00:44:48,465 --> 00:44:50,571
I totally forgot.
I'm so sorry.

748
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:52,090
You know, the most important
thing is that you're here, so...

749
00:44:52,173 --> 00:44:54,516
Bobby Bartender, drinks!
Drinks all around!

750
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:04,841
Family.

751
00:45:05,548 --> 00:45:08,217
You don't get to pick
the one you get...

752
00:45:08,301 --> 00:45:10,928
just got to love the
one that you got.

753
00:45:12,764 --> 00:45:15,392
Now, our mother...

754
00:45:15,476 --> 00:45:17,871
she lived alone until
the day that she died.

755
00:45:18,221 --> 00:45:21,516
And her death should be
a reminder to all of us

756
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,018
to enjoy life

757
00:45:23,102 --> 00:45:25,331
and spend the time
that we have together.

758
00:45:27,801 --> 00:45:29,361
Because we're not
going to get any back.

759
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:32,252
I love you guys.

760
00:45:32,335 --> 00:45:33,643
Aw.

761
00:45:33,727 --> 00:45:35,145
Cheers to that! Cheers!

762
00:45:35,229 --> 00:45:37,607
Cheers!

763
00:45:42,267 --> 00:45:43,890
This is strong.

764
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:47,018
What did you put in there?

765
00:45:47,127 --> 00:45:49,254
Julia? Oh, Jules!

766
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:50,807
Are you all right?

767
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:53,484
Oh, my God. There
was a bug in there.

768
00:45:53,568 --> 00:45:54,950
Extra protein.

769
00:46:16,343 --> 00:46:17,970
You on?

770
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:21,440
Oh.

771
00:46:21,524 --> 00:46:23,109
-I got it.
-I don't think you've got it.

772
00:46:23,193 --> 00:46:24,193
Oh, it's coming.

773
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,347
Actually, I'm starting
a new lifeguarding job.

774
00:46:30,431 --> 00:46:31,682
-That's great.
-Yeah.

775
00:46:31,766 --> 00:46:32,934
Charlie!

776
00:46:33,259 --> 00:46:34,343
Get up here!

777
00:46:51,206 --> 00:46:52,881
Jeez! Whoa!

778
00:46:54,388 --> 00:46:56,098
Erik!

779
00:46:56,182 --> 00:46:58,067
Ma, the grill's ready.

780
00:47:04,313 --> 00:47:05,656
Mmm.

781
00:47:15,674 --> 00:47:16,925
Mind if I join you?

782
00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:19,190
Have a seat. Take a load off.

783
00:47:21,113 --> 00:47:24,324
There we go.

784
00:47:24,694 --> 00:47:27,044
It's quite the setup
you've got here.

785
00:47:27,128 --> 00:47:30,423
Well, I wanted the kids
to have a happy childhood.

786
00:47:30,507 --> 00:47:31,759
Unlike some people I know.

787
00:47:33,055 --> 00:47:34,389
You're not talking
about us, are you?

788
00:47:34,472 --> 00:47:35,848
-Oh, no.
-We had a great childhood.

789
00:47:35,932 --> 00:47:37,475
-Mmm-hmm.
-I mean, look at me.

790
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:39,686
I turned out... fabulous.

791
00:47:44,101 --> 00:47:45,144
Yep.

792
00:47:47,717 --> 00:47:48,843
Huh.

793
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,197
Howard.

794
00:47:51,281 --> 00:47:52,574
-What?
-Come on. What is that?

795
00:47:52,658 --> 00:47:55,620
It looks like a house key to me.

796
00:47:55,704 --> 00:47:57,374
Come on. You know we've
got the spare room.

797
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,144
I know.

798
00:47:58,228 --> 00:48:01,570
And it's got to be better than
bouncing around trailer parks.

799
00:48:08,254 --> 00:48:09,839
I don't think this
is a good idea.

800
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:12,197
It's never too late
for a second chance.

801
00:48:16,016 --> 00:48:17,016
I'm sorry.

802
00:48:20,813 --> 00:48:22,419
They're better off without me.

803
00:48:25,798 --> 00:48:27,375
Pick up, pick up. Come on.

804
00:48:28,779 --> 00:48:30,631
Okay, wait, you bounce
me or I bounce you?

805
00:48:30,714 --> 00:48:32,634
You're bouncing me,
you're bouncing me.

806
00:48:45,226 --> 00:48:47,270
Hey, Dad! Come show
us your backflip!

807
00:48:47,354 --> 00:48:48,314
What? No, no, no.

808
00:48:48,398 --> 00:48:49,941
Yeah, come on, Uncle Howard!

809
00:48:50,025 --> 00:48:51,067
Come on, Howard!

810
00:48:51,151 --> 00:48:54,329
Howard! Howard! Howard!

811
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,470
Help him out, help him out.

812
00:48:56,554 --> 00:48:58,222
Thank you.

813
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:02,261
-Oh, yeah!
-There you go.

814
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:07,584
Stop stalling. What's the
worst thing that could happen?

815
00:49:07,668 --> 00:49:09,082
All right. Here
we go. Watch out.

816
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:10,481
Wait! Stop!

817
00:49:20,061 --> 00:49:22,397
Oh, nice catch, Aunt D.

818
00:49:22,481 --> 00:49:23,386
All right.

819
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:24,346
All right, here we go.

820
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:25,230
Okay, Dad.

821
00:49:25,314 --> 00:49:26,373
-Let's do it.
-Stay away from that edge.

822
00:49:26,456 --> 00:49:27,536
Come on, Uncle Howard.

823
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:28,986
There you go.
Just like college.

824
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:30,237
Yep, nice.

825
00:49:30,321 --> 00:49:31,822
Mom, you watch this?

826
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:32,981
Careful, Howard.

827
00:49:58,117 --> 00:49:59,118
Whoa!

828
00:49:59,202 --> 00:50:00,287
Not taking out of there.

829
00:50:00,371 --> 00:50:01,372
That's cheating!

830
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,875
Hey, Stefi!

831
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,476
-You made it!
-Stefani.

832
00:50:06,345 --> 00:50:07,994
I'm glad you decided to come.

833
00:50:08,078 --> 00:50:09,651
Now watch the master.

834
00:50:10,937 --> 00:50:12,885
Now the whole family's here!

835
00:50:15,378 --> 00:50:16,838
Yeah.

836
00:50:16,922 --> 00:50:19,192
I'm okay. I'm all right.

837
00:50:19,276 --> 00:50:20,670
Whoa, good.

838
00:50:24,253 --> 00:50:26,755
I'm okay. It's okay.

839
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:28,382
It's all right. Whoa.

840
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,751
The former things
have passed away.

841
00:50:43,834 --> 00:50:47,064
Neither shall there
be mourning nor pain.

842
00:50:47,192 --> 00:50:50,537
And he shall wipe away
every tear from their eyes.

843
00:50:51,354 --> 00:50:52,925
And death shall be no more.

844
00:51:41,123 --> 00:51:42,500
Hey.

845
00:51:48,516 --> 00:51:50,214
What is all this stuff?

846
00:51:55,268 --> 00:51:56,461
Okay.

847
00:51:56,896 --> 00:51:59,399
I found these papers
in Iris' book.

848
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:02,343
They are obituaries and articles

849
00:52:02,427 --> 00:52:05,013
for the people who
were at the Sky View

850
00:52:05,097 --> 00:52:08,183
on the night that Iris
had her premonition.

851
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:09,851
Each one of these
people went on to die

852
00:52:09,935 --> 00:52:12,003
in some weird and messed-up way.

853
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,379
And not only that,

854
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,048
they all died in the same order

855
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,759
as Iris' premonition.

856
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:19,262
Hundreds of people were
supposed to die that night,

857
00:52:19,346 --> 00:52:22,933
but Iris stopped the disaster.

858
00:52:23,017 --> 00:52:26,896
So, Death came back
for them one by one.

859
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,615
Since there were
so many survivors,

860
00:52:28,699 --> 00:52:31,702
it took years for Death
to get to all of them.

861
00:52:31,786 --> 00:52:34,283
But eventually it got to Iris.

862
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:37,585
I mean, she was the last
to die in the premonition.

863
00:52:37,669 --> 00:52:39,900
It was her and the little boy.

864
00:52:41,307 --> 00:52:43,434
But she was prepared.

865
00:52:43,751 --> 00:52:47,379
She single-handedly held
off Death for decades.

866
00:52:47,463 --> 00:52:49,797
Stefani, sweetie,

867
00:52:50,255 --> 00:52:52,549
I don't think this is the
appropriate time for this.

868
00:52:52,633 --> 00:52:55,406
Yeah, I mean, none of this even
has anything to do with us, right?

869
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:56,355
-No.
-Why are we even here?

870
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:58,170
No, it has everything
to do with us.

871
00:52:58,254 --> 00:53:00,582
I mean, because
Death took so long

872
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:02,127
to make its way
through the survivors,

873
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,630
these people went
on to have families.

874
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:05,954
Families that they
never should've had.

875
00:53:06,757 --> 00:53:09,009
So Death took them, too.

876
00:53:09,445 --> 00:53:12,700
I mean, don't you see this?

877
00:53:12,784 --> 00:53:14,160
Death is coming for us

878
00:53:14,244 --> 00:53:16,788
because we were never
supposed to exist.

879
00:53:16,872 --> 00:53:18,312
Okay, so, what,

880
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:20,799
everybody in this room
is on Death's "hit list"?

881
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:22,953
-Bobby, stop.
-That's what she's saying.

882
00:53:23,037 --> 00:53:25,377
No, no, no. Dad and
Aunt Brenda are safe

883
00:53:25,461 --> 00:53:27,421
because they're not
part of Iris' bloodline.

884
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:30,538
Okay, following the pattern...

885
00:53:30,622 --> 00:53:33,776
Death makes its way
down each branch by age.

886
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,733
So because Uncle
Howard was the oldest,

887
00:53:35,817 --> 00:53:37,137
it'll start with
his family first.

888
00:53:37,221 --> 00:53:38,757
Meaning, Erik, you're next.

889
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:39,928
Go fuck yourself.

890
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:42,681
Then it'll go for
Julia, then Bobby.

891
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,846
Then it'll come for our branch,

892
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:48,939
starting with Darlene,
then me, then Charlie.

893
00:53:49,811 --> 00:53:50,854
Charlie.

894
00:53:52,245 --> 00:53:53,656
You buying this?

895
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:55,814
I don't know.

896
00:53:55,898 --> 00:53:57,525
This is so messed up.

897
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,032
I mean, you're turning
our dad's death

898
00:53:59,115 --> 00:54:01,180
into some kind of fucked-up
conspiracy theory.

899
00:54:01,264 --> 00:54:02,760
-What is wrong with you?
-No, no, no.

900
00:54:02,844 --> 00:54:05,054
No, it's not a
conspiracy theory.

901
00:54:05,138 --> 00:54:06,681
-Stef, enough.
-We're all going to die!

902
00:54:06,765 --> 00:54:09,935
Stop! I can't listen to
this for one more minute.

903
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:11,771
That crazy woman's nonsense

904
00:54:11,855 --> 00:54:15,024
has caused enough pain and
suffering for this family.

905
00:54:15,108 --> 00:54:17,106
Hang on. Aunt Brenda,

906
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,397
-please just listen.
-For God's sake, leave it alone.

907
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,481
Okay, in Iris' book,
she mentions somebody

908
00:54:20,564 --> 00:54:22,316
who cheated Death and survived.

909
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,651
Stefani.

910
00:54:23,735 --> 00:54:25,278
-Come on.
-Erik. No, wait.

911
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:27,638
-I'm worried about you.
-Stop.

912
00:54:28,777 --> 00:54:30,638
-Let me take care of this.
-Come on, Bobby.

913
00:54:30,721 --> 00:54:31,888
-Brenda.
-Let's go.

914
00:54:31,972 --> 00:54:33,392
-Brenda, I'm sorry.
-No, no, no.

915
00:54:33,475 --> 00:54:34,599
-I didn't know.
-Please.

916
00:54:34,682 --> 00:54:36,006
You believe me, right?

917
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:37,830
-I'm sorry.
-Julia.

918
00:54:37,914 --> 00:54:39,597
Look, I love you.

919
00:54:40,924 --> 00:54:43,038
But sometimes I really hate you.

920
00:55:03,041 --> 00:55:07,377
I know how convincing
all of this can be.

921
00:55:07,947 --> 00:55:09,816
But it's not real.

922
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,524
How can you say that?

923
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,268
I know Iris taught
you all of this.

924
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:17,394
Don't let my mom's beliefs
derail your life...

925
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:19,620
the same way they did mine.

926
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:25,604
Thank you so much
for that advice,

927
00:55:25,688 --> 00:55:28,042
but I really don't
need a mom anymore.

928
00:55:32,823 --> 00:55:33,949
All right, open wide.

929
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:35,850
-Ah...
-All right, good.

930
00:55:37,816 --> 00:55:39,911
-This is going to pinch, all right? You ready?
-Mmm-hmm.

931
00:55:39,994 --> 00:55:42,162
Five, four, three...

932
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:47,000
...two, one.

933
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:48,821
Good job.

934
00:55:50,753 --> 00:55:53,330
Ready to hit the club.
Need you to lock up.

935
00:55:53,414 --> 00:55:54,943
And don't touch
any of my liquor.

936
00:55:55,027 --> 00:55:56,938
No, no, you didn't say
anything about locking up.

937
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,979
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-You didn't say shit about closing, dude!

938
00:55:59,062 --> 00:56:01,014
Yeah, cry me a river.

939
00:56:01,098 --> 00:56:02,767
I hope you burn in hell!

940
00:56:05,212 --> 00:56:06,797
-Do you believe that shit?
-Mmm.

941
00:56:06,881 --> 00:56:08,363
My old man just died.

942
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,866
I come in as a favor
to that asshole,

943
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,951
and now he wants me to lock up.

944
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,610
-Mmm.
-You know what that is?

945
00:56:13,694 --> 00:56:15,113
-Mmm-hmm.
-You know what that is?

946
00:56:15,197 --> 00:56:16,929
-Mmm.
-It's inconsiderate.

947
00:56:17,013 --> 00:56:18,429
Anyway, you're all done.

948
00:56:18,513 --> 00:56:20,098
Mmm-hmm. Thank you.

949
00:56:20,182 --> 00:56:21,809

Charlie, wake up!

989
01:00:52,284 --> 01:00:53,660
I've been trying to
call Erik all night.

990
01:00:53,743 --> 01:00:54,776
He's not answering me.

991
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:57,011
I don't know where
he is. I'm worried.

992
01:00:57,095 --> 01:00:58,570
I'm sure he's fine.

993
01:00:58,654 --> 01:00:59,977
Well, have you heard from him?

994
01:01:07,233 --> 01:01:09,527
I'm going over there.
I need to check on him.

995
01:01:10,557 --> 01:01:12,402
And you're coming, too, Charlie!

996
01:01:15,266 --> 01:01:18,320
It keeps going to voicemail.

997
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:20,535
Is that him?

998
01:01:20,619 --> 01:01:22,428
My friend just said
the tattoo parlor

999
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,721
burned down last night.

1000
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,139
What?

1001
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,058
Stef, Stef, Stef!

1002
01:01:27,865 --> 01:01:29,617
Ow!

1003
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,478
You trying to kill me?

1004
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:32,836
Erik?

1005
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:35,441
Oh, yeah, no, of
course it's you.

1006
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,845
Dude!

1007
01:01:40,929 --> 01:01:42,474
We heard about the fire.
We thought you were dead.

1008
01:01:42,557 --> 01:01:44,350
I'm fine.

1009
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:46,155
Oh, my God. Are you okay?
I was so worried about you.

1010
01:01:46,238 --> 01:01:48,063
Yeah. The firefighters
said I was lucky as fuck

1011
01:01:48,146 --> 01:01:49,705
that I was wearing
that leather jacket.

1012
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,624
Barely got burned.

1013
01:01:51,707 --> 01:01:53,126
Ruined my favorite
jacket though.

1014
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,191
-What is this?
-Oh, yeah, check it out.

1015
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,672
I got branded.

1016
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,173
It's sick, right?

1017
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,341
You like it?

1018
01:02:00,424 --> 01:02:01,607
You said you were asleep.

1019
01:02:01,691 --> 01:02:03,136
You were blowing up my phone
like a goddamn stalker.

1020
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,287
What did you want me to do?

1021
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:06,639
No, I don't get it.
You should be dead.

1022
01:02:06,722 --> 01:02:08,808
Right. Yeah, yeah.

1023
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,479
Or, you know, maybe...

1024
01:02:11,563 --> 01:02:14,108
Maybe Death's not actually
coming for our family.

1025
01:02:14,192 --> 01:02:16,399
Because that would
be fucking crazy.

1026
01:02:17,177 --> 01:02:18,220
Jesus!

1027
01:02:18,304 --> 01:02:19,888
Shit!

1028
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,109
Or maybe I'm invincible.

1029
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,486
Erik.

1030
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,328
Erik!

1031
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,705
-Yeah?
-Erik, wait.

1032
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:32,290
-Stop, just wait, okay?
-Mmm-hmm.

1033
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:33,583
Just because Death didn't
kill you last night,

1034
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:35,215
doesn't mean that you're safe.

1035
01:02:36,869 --> 01:02:38,903
Stay away from
that tree trimmer!

1036
01:02:38,986 --> 01:02:41,280
Ooh... Ooh!

1037
01:02:41,444 --> 01:02:42,821
Is it going to move
on its own, Stef?

1038
01:02:42,904 --> 01:02:44,475
Is that what it's going to do?

1039
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,649
It could fall.

1040
01:02:46,946 --> 01:02:48,990
And stay away from these kids.

1041
01:02:49,074 --> 01:02:50,825
I'll take my chances.

1042
01:02:50,909 --> 01:02:53,119
Stef, how's a couple
kids with a soccer ball

1043
01:02:53,203 --> 01:02:54,829
going to kill him?

1044
01:02:54,913 --> 01:02:57,415
I mean, I don't know.

1045
01:02:57,499 --> 01:03:00,001
The trimmer could fall and
hit the leaf blower guy,

1046
01:03:00,085 --> 01:03:02,504
which causes him to...

1047
01:03:02,588 --> 01:03:04,006
blow stuff into the kids' eyes

1048
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:05,591
and then kick the
ball into his face.

1049
01:03:05,675 --> 01:03:07,586
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1050
01:03:08,612 --> 01:03:10,475
Soccer ball to my face?

1051
01:03:11,465 --> 01:03:13,115
That does sound deadly.

1052
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,535
I should be more careful.

1053
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,502
-Hey!
-What's up?

1054
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:19,921
What happened to you?

1055
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,048
Charbroiled by
Death, apparently.

1056
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,133
-Kiki, that looks really bad.
-Yeah, it's fine.

1057
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,093
No, wait. Let me see that.

1058
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:29,305
-Erik, just stay away from the truck.
-Stop.

1059
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,708
-Oh, what, this truck?
-Stop!

1060
01:03:30,792 --> 01:03:31,933
Oh, my God.

1061
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:32,993
Please.

1062
01:03:33,077 --> 01:03:34,414
-This truck right here?
-Please just listen to me for one...

1063
01:03:34,497 --> 01:03:35,874
But it's such a beautiful truck.

1064
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:36,955
Please. Stop, stop.
Don't touch...

1065
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:38,306
-Mwah!
-Erik, get away!

1066
01:03:38,389 --> 01:03:39,834
Stop!

1067
01:03:40,141 --> 01:03:41,976
-You like that?
-Can you just...

1068
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,070
Oh, my God.

1069
01:03:44,586 --> 01:03:46,672
Oh! Uh-oh.

1070
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,991
Oh, Erik's tempting Death again.

1071
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,368
What's going to happen?

1072
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:54,080
-Stop doing that!
-What is going to happen?

1073
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,816
-Nothing at all.
-Please, just...

1074
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:57,922
How about that?

1075
01:03:58,006 --> 01:04:00,247
-Look, I'm just trying to help you.
-Okay.

1076
01:04:00,331 --> 01:04:01,299
Try less.

1077
01:04:01,383 --> 01:04:04,555
Yeah. Honestly, we are so
done with your garbage.

1078
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:07,267
-Can you please...
-Okay, for the 1,500th time,

1079
01:04:07,351 --> 01:04:09,804
no one gives a shit about your
stupid little Death curse, okay?

1080
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:11,747
So take a hint
and leave us alone

1081
01:04:11,831 --> 01:04:13,583
because Death's not
coming for our family!

1082
01:04:18,067 --> 01:04:19,807
Julia!

1083
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:21,439
Shit.

1084
01:04:24,374 --> 01:04:26,085
-Julia!
-Julia!

1085
01:04:26,169 --> 01:04:28,129
-Julia!
-Julia!

1086
01:04:28,213 --> 01:04:30,799
Stop the truck! Stop the truck!

1087
01:04:42,381 --> 01:04:44,425
-Stop the truck!
-Hey! Hey!

1088
01:04:44,509 --> 01:04:45,762
Stop the fucking truck!

1089
01:04:45,845 --> 01:04:47,234
My sister's in the garbage!

-Julia?
-Stef!

1097
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:11,412
Give me your hand!

1098
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,075
I got you!

1099
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,619
Don't worry, you're not next!

1100
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:16,079
Whoa! Whoa!

1101
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:19,016
-Help!
-Hey, stop! Stop!

1102
01:05:19,104 --> 01:05:20,314
-Stop!
-Stop!

1103
01:05:20,398 --> 01:05:21,858
-Stop! Stop!
-Stop!

1104
01:05:23,694 --> 01:05:25,474
-Stef!
-My sister's in the back!

1105
01:05:43,176 --> 01:05:45,605
-I'm so sorry, sweetie.
-Dad.

1106
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,473
We should've believed you, Stef.

1107
01:05:59,466 --> 01:06:00,918
No, I, uh...

1108
01:06:03,014 --> 01:06:04,176
I screwed up the order,

1109
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,737
and now Julia's dead
and it's my fault.

1110
01:06:07,025 --> 01:06:09,433
Guys, look.

1111
01:06:09,517 --> 01:06:12,145
What happened was
traumatic and awful.

1112
01:06:12,229 --> 01:06:14,245
-It's not anybody's fault.
-Marty, please don't.

1113
01:06:16,624 --> 01:06:18,037
It's my fault.

1114
01:06:19,002 --> 01:06:20,253
Mom, it's not your fault.

1115
01:06:20,337 --> 01:06:21,755
It is my fault.

1116
01:06:23,756 --> 01:06:25,716
Stefani, you were only
wrong about the order

1117
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,195
because there is
something you didn't know.

1118
01:06:32,813 --> 01:06:36,485
Erik isn't Howard's
biological son.

1119
01:06:39,113 --> 01:06:41,324
I'm sorry. What are
you talking about?

1120
01:06:41,408 --> 01:06:42,979
And, Stefani, I
didn't believe you,

1121
01:06:43,063 --> 01:06:44,815
so I didn't say anything to you,

1122
01:06:44,899 --> 01:06:46,442
and now my little girl is dead.

1123
01:06:46,526 --> 01:06:48,684
I don't understand.
What, you had an affair?

1124
01:06:48,919 --> 01:06:51,672
Your father and I were
having such a hard time...

1125
01:06:51,756 --> 01:06:54,133
but it was good
because I got you.

1126
01:06:54,217 --> 01:06:55,696
-I got you out of it.
-Who's my real dad then?

1127
01:06:55,779 --> 01:06:56,558
Who's my real dad?

1128
01:06:56,642 --> 01:06:59,352
It doesn't matter because
Howard loved you so, so much.

1129
01:06:59,436 --> 01:07:00,907
Who is it?

1130
01:07:02,493 --> 01:07:03,813
Who's my real dad?

1131
01:07:07,099 --> 01:07:08,431
Jerry Fenbury.

1132
01:07:09,137 --> 01:07:10,264
Oh!

1133
01:07:10,753 --> 01:07:12,213
Jerry Fenbury?

1134
01:07:12,297 --> 01:07:13,421
Yes.

1135
01:07:13,505 --> 01:07:14,923
Oh, shit.

1136
01:07:15,007 --> 01:07:16,009
-No, no, no!
-Erik.

1137
01:07:16,092 --> 01:07:17,677
Jerry fucking Fenbury?

1138
01:07:17,761 --> 01:07:19,638
You don't know what
we were going through.

1139
01:07:19,722 --> 01:07:22,516
Oh, God! What, is this why he
always wanted to play catch?

1140
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,218
Oh, my God.

1141
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:31,385
Okay.

1142
01:07:31,469 --> 01:07:33,346
All right, so, that means that,

1143
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:36,272
if it's going in the
right order, that...

1144
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:38,553
I'm next, right?

1145
01:07:44,952 --> 01:07:46,756
You got to help me, Stef.

1146
01:07:47,891 --> 01:07:49,184
Bobby, I don't...

1147
01:07:49,268 --> 01:07:50,517
I don't think that I can.

1148
01:07:50,601 --> 01:07:52,300
I mean, I thought I
did, but I don't know...

1149
01:07:52,383 --> 01:07:55,157
No. But you can.

1150
01:07:56,407 --> 01:07:59,323
I mean, you predicted exactly
what was going to happen.

1151
01:08:00,457 --> 01:08:01,834
You just got the order wrong

1152
01:08:01,918 --> 01:08:03,703
because you didn't have
all the information.

1153
01:08:03,787 --> 01:08:05,347
-Charlie.
-What do you mean "predicted"?

1154
01:08:05,753 --> 01:08:07,713
She saw everything.

1155
01:08:07,797 --> 01:08:10,855
The trimmer, the blower,
the soccer ball. Like...

1156
01:08:10,939 --> 01:08:13,049
It was like there were
pieces to a puzzle.

1157
01:08:13,133 --> 01:08:14,427
She just had to
put them together.

1158
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:15,888
-You know what I mean?
-Is that true?

1159
01:08:15,971 --> 01:08:17,180
Darlene, please.

1160
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:19,766
-Do not encourage this.
-Marty.

1161
01:08:19,874 --> 01:08:21,641
I mean...

1162
01:08:22,150 --> 01:08:24,861
I mean, it's everything
in Iris' book, it's...

1163
01:08:24,945 --> 01:08:27,865
It's like an
equation. It's math.

1164
01:08:27,949 --> 01:08:30,994
Stefani, if you can see how
all of this fits together,

1165
01:08:31,078 --> 01:08:32,313
we might have a chance.

1166
01:08:32,397 --> 01:08:33,982
Stop. Just stop.

1167
01:08:35,061 --> 01:08:37,555
You devastated this family
when you walked out.

1168
01:08:37,639 --> 01:08:39,641
But we've been okay without you.

1169
01:08:39,837 --> 01:08:40,963
I'm begging you

1170
01:08:41,047 --> 01:08:43,370
not to traumatize
our kids anymore.

1171
01:08:43,802 --> 01:08:45,609
It's real this time.

1172
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:52,004
I'm going for a walk.

1173
01:08:52,468 --> 01:08:53,658
I need some air.

1174
01:08:58,825 --> 01:09:00,716
I can appreciate that...

1175
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,615
our family is
clearly going to need

1176
01:09:02,699 --> 01:09:04,084
some counseling in the future,

1177
01:09:04,168 --> 01:09:06,128
but can we focus on the fact

1178
01:09:06,212 --> 01:09:08,464
that we're all
about to die, right?

1179
01:09:08,548 --> 01:09:09,548
I mean...

1180
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,151
I mean, Stef,

1181
01:09:11,235 --> 01:09:13,954
didn't you say
that... that Iris...

1182
01:09:14,038 --> 01:09:16,540
knew someone that cheated
death or something?

1183
01:09:16,624 --> 01:09:17,736
Yeah, uh...

1184
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:20,656
In here, somewhere.

1185
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:22,231
It says...

1186
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:25,954
that, uh... Right here.

1187
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:27,706
"JB found someone
who survived."

1188
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:31,085
But it doesn't say anything
about who this JB was or...

1189
01:09:31,169 --> 01:09:33,087
Wait a minute. I
know that name.

1190
01:09:33,171 --> 01:09:34,714
My mom used to write me letters,

1191
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:36,717
and she sometimes would talk

1192
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:38,094
about a friend of hers named JB

1193
01:09:38,178 --> 01:09:40,222
who worked at a hospital.

1194
01:09:40,306 --> 01:09:41,390
Hospital.

1195
01:09:41,474 --> 01:09:43,100
Um... um...

1196
01:09:43,184 --> 01:09:44,268
Something, uh...

1197
01:09:44,352 --> 01:09:46,771
Something River Hospital. Uh...

1198
01:09:46,855 --> 01:09:48,523
Deep River. Uh...

1199
01:09:48,607 --> 01:09:50,609
Peace River Hospital.
Uh, Clear River...

1200
01:09:50,693 --> 01:09:52,987
-Hope River?
-That's it!

1201
01:09:53,071 --> 01:09:54,823
Shit, it's like an hour away.

1202
01:09:54,907 --> 01:09:55,972
I'm going.

1203
01:09:56,056 --> 01:09:57,666
I'm going to go find him
and talk to him myself.

1204
01:09:57,749 --> 01:09:59,084
Well, I'm coming with you.

1205
01:09:59,168 --> 01:10:01,717
-Me, too.
-Okay. Yeah, yeah, let's go.

1206
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:04,577
Bobby, uh...

1207
01:10:04,802 --> 01:10:06,098
What?

1208
01:10:06,182 --> 01:10:08,397
You need to stay here
with your mom. It's safer.

1209
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:10,900
Yeah, fuck that.
Are you kidding me?

1210
01:10:10,984 --> 01:10:12,376
I'm not staying here by myself.

1211
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:14,652
Well, it's too dangerous on
the road for you. You can't.

1212
01:10:14,735 --> 01:10:18,155
No, I read Gammy's Death
Book, okay? All right?

1213
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:19,616
I mean, there's,
like, a thousand

1214
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:22,161
house-related deaths
in that thing, man.

1215
01:10:22,245 --> 01:10:24,080
You trip down the stairs,

1216
01:10:24,164 --> 01:10:26,923
fall... down a
toilet or something.

1217
01:10:27,007 --> 01:10:28,378
I don't know, but
I'm not... I'm not...

1218
01:10:28,461 --> 01:10:30,482
No way. I'm not staying here.

1219
01:10:31,245 --> 01:10:33,247
-Hang on, hang on.
-Hey, okay.

1220
01:10:33,331 --> 01:10:34,487
-Okay.
-Too fast.

1221
01:10:34,571 --> 01:10:35,881
Okay, okay. We'll go
slow. We'll go slow.

1222
01:10:35,964 --> 01:10:37,001
I'm going to go
open up the truck.

1223
01:10:37,084 --> 01:10:38,817
-Charlie, check the back.
-Got it.

1224
01:10:44,074 --> 01:10:45,909
Be careful. The step's
slippery sometimes.

1225
01:10:45,993 --> 01:10:47,160
Oi!

1226
01:10:49,109 --> 01:10:51,203
Any of you fuckers
do a nut check?

1227
01:10:51,592 --> 01:10:52,676
Excuse me?

1228
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,472
You made cookies in that thing

1229
01:10:54,556 --> 01:10:56,934
with peanut butter in
them just a few days ago.

1230
01:10:57,306 --> 01:10:59,975
This poor bastard so much
as even touches a nut,

1231
01:11:00,059 --> 01:11:02,577
his throat is going to
close up tighter than...

1232
01:11:02,661 --> 01:11:04,682
You understand. Where's
the peanut butter?

1233
01:11:04,766 --> 01:11:07,400
-Cabinet above the sink.
-Thank you.

1234
01:11:08,057 --> 01:11:10,186
I'm so sorry, Bobby. I just...

1235
01:11:11,054 --> 01:11:12,097
Yeah.

1236
01:11:12,752 --> 01:11:14,185
Hey. Okay.

1237
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:17,996
All clear.

1238
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,039
Thank you.

1239
01:11:19,123 --> 01:11:21,417
You're a good brother, Erik.

1240
01:11:21,501 --> 01:11:23,003
-Nut check.
-What?

1241
01:11:23,087 --> 01:11:24,922
Stupid.

1242
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:29,462
It was good. I get it.

1243
01:11:29,546 --> 01:11:30,797
Let's go. Come on.

1244
01:11:30,881 --> 01:11:32,591
It's only going to get worse.

1245
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:33,955
God damn it.

1246
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:36,916
Wait! I'm coming with you, bro.

1247
01:11:37,325 --> 01:11:38,700
Someone's got to protect you.

they lay me to rest ♪

1249
01:11:43,798 --> 01:11:46,872

1250
01:11:46,956 --> 01:11:49,128
Dad's calling. Again.

1251
01:11:49,212 --> 01:11:50,673
Tell him we just went
for a ride with Mom.

1252
01:11:50,756 --> 01:11:52,049
He's not going to believe that.

1253
01:11:52,133 --> 01:11:53,782
At least it'll buy us some time.

1254
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:55,471
All right.

1255
01:11:57,569 --> 01:11:59,633
If Death doesn't get
us, your dad will.

1256
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,161
I always keep them
where I can see them.

1257
01:12:16,578 --> 01:12:18,413
I mean, you could've
just had the real thing,

1258
01:12:18,497 --> 01:12:20,794
but it's okay, not
everyone wants to be a mom.

1259
01:12:23,432 --> 01:12:25,100
Is that what you think?

1260
01:12:25,404 --> 01:12:27,089
That I didn't want
to be your mom?

1261
01:12:29,926 --> 01:12:32,304
Look, I was raised by a woman

1262
01:12:32,388 --> 01:12:35,569
who taught me to see
Death everywhere.

1263
01:12:36,065 --> 01:12:37,483
I thought I could
put it behind me,

1264
01:12:37,567 --> 01:12:39,834
but then when I had
you and your brother,

1265
01:12:39,918 --> 01:12:42,499
all I could see were a
hundred different ways

1266
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:44,702
that you and Charlie could die.

1267
01:12:45,354 --> 01:12:47,439
I didn't want you
to leave the house.

1268
01:12:47,523 --> 01:12:50,996
I would freak out on
you guys over nothing.

1269
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:53,499
One day, I looked at your face

1270
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:56,043
and I saw the same
scared little girl

1271
01:12:56,127 --> 01:12:57,407
that I was, growing up,

1272
01:12:57,491 --> 01:13:00,307
and I knew that if I stayed,
I was going to ruin your life.

1273
01:13:02,828 --> 01:13:04,932
I have no idea if I
did the right thing.

1274
01:13:06,355 --> 01:13:07,980
But I'm here for you now.

1275
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:33,610
It's okay.

1276
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:35,231
I'm right behind you.

1277
01:13:46,879 --> 01:13:49,590
Hey. Now you see,
buddy. We got you.

1278
01:13:49,674 --> 01:13:51,259
The front desk is this way.

1279
01:13:56,463 --> 01:13:58,298
Oh. Hi.

1280
01:13:58,382 --> 01:14:01,961
Uh... we're looking for JB.

1281
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:03,718
And who are you?

1282
01:14:04,255 --> 01:14:07,333
The front desk told us we could
find him down here. Is that you?

1283
01:14:07,417 --> 01:14:09,875
That would be me.

1284
01:14:19,111 --> 01:14:21,363
William John Bludworth.

1285
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,190
But my friends call me JB.

1286
01:14:24,274 --> 01:14:27,319
I've been waiting
for you, Stefani.

1287
01:14:27,403 --> 01:14:29,572
Charlie, Darlene.

1288
01:14:29,656 --> 01:14:32,533
But no Howard, no Julia.

1289
01:14:33,192 --> 01:14:36,285
So, which one of you is next?

1290
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:41,308
Hi.

1291
01:14:41,392 --> 01:14:43,709
I was sorry to hear about Iris.

1292
01:14:44,273 --> 01:14:46,462
She was a special woman.

1293
01:14:47,057 --> 01:14:49,059
How did you know her?

1294
01:14:49,143 --> 01:14:50,979
She saved my life.

1295
01:14:51,476 --> 01:14:52,561
When?

1296
01:14:54,707 --> 01:14:56,748
At the Sky View.

1297
01:15:01,404 --> 01:15:04,179
My mother brought me with
her to work that night.

1298
01:15:04,263 --> 01:15:05,745
JB, honey, I told you,

1299
01:15:05,829 --> 01:15:07,998
you got to stay back
there while I'm on stage.

1300
01:15:08,093 --> 01:15:09,750
I wasn't supposed to be there,

1301
01:15:09,834 --> 01:15:12,187
except, of course, to die.

1302
01:15:12,271 --> 01:15:14,154

01:15:18,954 --> 01:15:21,169
Everyone needs to get
off the dance floor!

1307
01:15:21,253 --> 01:15:23,802
The glass is about to break.
Everyone needs to get off now!

1308
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:25,220
Wait! No!

1309
01:15:25,304 --> 01:15:26,304
Iris!

1310
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:38,910
You were the last to die.
You were the little boy.

1311
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:41,835
Correct.

1312
01:15:41,919 --> 01:15:43,840
So, all that time, she wasn't...

1313
01:15:43,924 --> 01:15:46,051
She wasn't just
protecting our family,

1314
01:15:46,135 --> 01:15:47,937
she was protecting you, too.

1315
01:15:48,803 --> 01:15:51,430
Years later, she
tracked me down.

1316
01:15:51,514 --> 01:15:53,342
Helped me see the truth.

1317
01:15:53,697 --> 01:15:55,574
We traded ideas.

1318
01:15:55,658 --> 01:15:58,416
I helped her fortify her cabin.

1319
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,026
We became friends.

1320
01:16:00,603 --> 01:16:04,190
I even helped her get the
best medical care I could,

1321
01:16:04,274 --> 01:16:05,842
considering her condition.

1322
01:16:05,926 --> 01:16:08,011
Iris said that
you found somebody

1323
01:16:08,095 --> 01:16:09,680
who stopped Death and survived.

1324
01:16:09,764 --> 01:16:11,141
Yes.

1325
01:16:11,225 --> 01:16:13,811
Uh, and how do we do that?

1326
01:16:13,895 --> 01:16:16,032
There are only two ways.

1327
01:16:16,175 --> 01:16:19,078
By killing or by dying.

1328
01:16:19,562 --> 01:16:21,224
If you take a life,

1329
01:16:21,308 --> 01:16:23,602
you get the time
that person had left.

1330
01:16:23,686 --> 01:16:26,398
What? No! I'm not
going to kill someone.

1331
01:16:26,482 --> 01:16:27,864
Maybe we should
let the guy finish.

1332
01:16:27,948 --> 01:16:31,743
And to truly break the
cycle, you have to die.

1333
01:16:31,827 --> 01:16:35,080
What... What does that mean?

1334
01:16:35,164 --> 01:16:39,377
A long time ago, a young
woman named Kimberly Corman

1335
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:41,547
found herself on Death's list.

1336
01:16:41,631 --> 01:16:43,633
Just like you.

1337
01:16:43,717 --> 01:16:46,094
And when her turn finally came,

1338
01:16:46,178 --> 01:16:47,464
she died.

1339
01:16:47,548 --> 01:16:48,688
Flatlined.

1340
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:50,858
But her doctor managed
to bring her back,

1341
01:16:50,942 --> 01:16:53,778
and that broke the chain.

1342
01:16:53,862 --> 01:16:55,213
All right then, we'll do that.

1343
01:16:55,297 --> 01:16:56,725
What are you talking about?

1344
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,178
Uh... why didn't
Iris try that?

1345
01:17:00,262 --> 01:17:01,555
It's risky.

1346
01:17:01,639 --> 01:17:04,851
And if you fuck
with Death and lose,

1347
01:17:04,935 --> 01:17:08,334
things can get very messy.

1348
01:17:10,715 --> 01:17:14,260
Wait. Hang on, hang
on. Okay, wait. No.

1349
01:17:14,344 --> 01:17:15,779
There has to be another way.

1350
01:17:15,863 --> 01:17:17,439
Please, you have to help us.

1351
01:17:17,726 --> 01:17:20,851
For years, people have been
coming to me for advice.

1352
01:17:22,161 --> 01:17:23,704
Well, I'm tired.

1353
01:17:23,788 --> 01:17:25,623
I'm done with all that.

1354
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:27,792
And now I'm sick,
just like Iris.

1355
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:30,462
There's no running this time.

1356
01:17:30,546 --> 01:17:34,300
The fact is, you're
all going to die.

1357
01:17:34,384 --> 01:17:37,579
And after that, I will, too.

1358
01:17:41,033 --> 01:17:44,263
Now that my old friend
is gone, I'm retiring.

1359
01:17:44,347 --> 01:17:46,309
-So, what, you're just gonna leave us here?
-Wait, wait, wait!

1360
01:17:46,392 --> 01:17:47,868
Dude, we need your help.
Where are you going?

1361
01:17:47,951 --> 01:17:50,162
I intend to enjoy

1362
01:17:50,563 --> 01:17:52,473
the time I have left.

1363
01:17:52,631 --> 01:17:56,134
And I suggest that
you do the same.

1364
01:17:56,818 --> 01:17:58,486
Life is precious.

1365
01:17:59,784 --> 01:18:02,427
Enjoy every single second.

1366
01:18:03,312 --> 01:18:05,135
You never know when.

1367
01:18:10,596 --> 01:18:11,722
Good luck.

1368
01:18:17,129 --> 01:18:19,002
Well, that's fantastic.

1369
01:18:19,641 --> 01:18:20,975
No.

1370
01:18:21,132 --> 01:18:22,466
-No, that...
-Bobby.

1371
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:25,240
That can't be it.
No. No, there...

1372
01:18:25,324 --> 01:18:27,150
There has to be something here.

1373
01:18:27,234 --> 01:18:28,902
There has to be another answer.

1374
01:18:28,986 --> 01:18:30,779
Stef. Stef.

1375
01:18:30,863 --> 01:18:33,157
Stef, he gave us an answer.

1376
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:34,909
Bobby's got to die.

1377
01:18:34,993 --> 01:18:36,113
Erik!

1378
01:18:36,197 --> 01:18:37,316
Are you fucking insane?

1379
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:38,858
-We're not killing Bobby!
-Whoa, whoa!

1380
01:18:38,941 --> 01:18:41,294
Am I the only guy that
just listened to that dude?

1381
01:18:41,378 --> 01:18:42,360
There's only one way.

1382
01:18:42,444 --> 01:18:44,456
We kill Bobby, we
resuscitate him,

1383
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:46,414
and then, boom, you're
all off Death's list.

1384
01:18:46,498 --> 01:18:47,383
Congratulations.

1385
01:18:47,467 --> 01:18:48,917
There has to be
something else, right?

1386
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,651
I mean, there has to be
another solution, right, Stef?

1387
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:53,592
No.

1388
01:18:54,421 --> 01:18:56,757
No, there's nothing
else we can do, okay?

1389
01:18:56,841 --> 01:18:57,967
It's over.

1390
01:18:59,183 --> 01:19:00,296
Hey.

1391
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:01,756
Stefani, listen to me.

1392
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,383
You got to trust me
on this one, okay?

1393
01:19:03,467 --> 01:19:06,035
She's giving up on
you, I'm not going to.

1394
01:19:06,119 --> 01:19:09,872
Look, Iris found a way to
hold Death off for decades.

1395
01:19:11,897 --> 01:19:13,702
-So will we.
-I trust that guy.

1396
01:19:13,786 --> 01:19:15,037
You trust that guy?

1397
01:19:15,121 --> 01:19:16,464
-He was...
-That just went there?

1398
01:19:16,548 --> 01:19:17,970
He was awfully charismatic,

1399
01:19:18,054 --> 01:19:20,591
and you know that
as well as I do.

1400
01:19:31,573 --> 01:19:32,615
Uh...

1401
01:19:33,494 --> 01:19:35,752
Erik and Bobby are gone.

1402
01:19:36,212 --> 01:19:38,178
Shit. Shit!

1403
01:19:39,264 --> 01:19:40,528
I don't think I like this.

1404
01:19:40,612 --> 01:19:42,916
Hey, dude, we're in
a hospital, remember?

1405
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,053
There's doctors everywhere.

1406
01:19:44,136 --> 01:19:46,016
We kill you, they
bring you back,

1407
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:48,478
everybody's safe, we're heroes.

1408
01:19:48,562 --> 01:19:50,421
Dude, that is literally the
opposite of keeping me safe.

1409
01:19:50,504 --> 01:19:52,589
What's the alternative, huh?

1410
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,923
You want to kill someone,
take the time they have left?

1411
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,639
How? How do you even know
how many years they have?

1412
01:20:06,011 --> 01:20:07,958
-No. No.
-No. Not good with that.

1413
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:11,417
-Well, I mean...
-No.

1414
01:20:11,501 --> 01:20:13,169
-No, of course not.
-We wouldn't do that.

1415
01:20:13,253 --> 01:20:15,380
-No, we would never.
-Don't touch those babies.

1416
01:20:15,464 --> 01:20:17,716
Look, bottom line...

1417
01:20:17,966 --> 01:20:19,617
flatlining is your best option.

1418
01:20:20,621 --> 01:20:21,926
What do you have to lose?

1419
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:26,619
-Okay.
-Okay.

1420
01:20:26,703 --> 01:20:29,081
All right, how would
we even do that?

1421
01:20:29,165 --> 01:20:30,741
See, I've got an idea.

1422
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:33,944
But it's a little nuts.

1423
01:20:39,785 --> 01:20:41,805
Your allergy is deadly, right?

1424
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,753
Yeah.

1425
01:20:45,230 --> 01:20:46,231
Well...

1426
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,541
Hey, dude, wait.

1427
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:53,480
No, look, all right?

1428
01:20:53,564 --> 01:20:55,524
If I'm going out, it's not
going to be on those...

1429
01:20:55,941 --> 01:20:58,427
what, unsalted
bitches, all right?

1430
01:20:59,388 --> 01:21:00,540
Give me those.

1431
01:21:02,612 --> 01:21:03,896
Nice choice.

1432
01:21:13,462 --> 01:21:15,255
Oh, you got to be
kidding me. Come on!

1433
01:21:16,172 --> 01:21:17,349
-Hey.
-Stupid!

1434
01:21:17,433 --> 01:21:18,367
-All right.
-Come on!

1435
01:21:18,451 --> 01:21:20,593
You know, maybe this is
a sign, so we can just...

1436
01:21:22,785 --> 01:21:25,834
Okay. Hey, dude, maybe
we can just bail now.

1437
01:21:25,918 --> 01:21:27,211
No, I'm not giving up.

1438
01:21:30,851 --> 01:21:32,769
-What the hell?
-Can you help?

1439
01:21:32,853 --> 01:21:34,938
It's all right. We work here.

1440
01:21:35,022 --> 01:21:37,441
Maintenance. It's fine. Put
your headphones back on.

1441
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:40,072
Dude, it's going to
fall. It's going to fall.

1442
01:21:41,198 --> 01:21:42,548
Oh, my! It's falling!

1443
01:21:42,632 --> 01:21:45,029
-Did you get it up?
-I can't hold it! It's going to fall!

1444
01:21:51,076 --> 01:21:52,285
Easy work.

1445
01:21:54,244 --> 01:21:55,692
Now what?

1446
01:21:56,108 --> 01:21:57,649
Come with me. Come with me.

1447
01:21:59,275 --> 01:22:00,275
What?

1448
01:22:01,752 --> 01:22:03,552
Hey, hang here. I
got to get something.

1449
01:22:04,905 --> 01:22:07,222
-Don't move.
-What are you talk...

1450
01:22:14,509 --> 01:22:17,144
Okay. Don't move.

1451
01:22:54,266 --> 01:22:56,581
No, that's... that's cool.

1452
01:22:56,665 --> 01:22:58,987
I searched the bathrooms.
They weren't in the RV?

1453
01:22:59,071 --> 01:23:01,029
No. Look, if Erik was
trying to kill Bobby,

1454
01:23:01,113 --> 01:23:02,030
where would they be?

1455
01:23:02,114 --> 01:23:02,750
I don't know,

1456
01:23:02,834 --> 01:23:04,716
but there's a million
ways to die in a hospital.

1457
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,636
Can I help you? Excuse me.

1458
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,499
No, just here to see my nana.

1459
01:23:15,148 --> 01:23:16,782
Lovely day today.

1460
01:23:16,866 --> 01:23:18,368
Got much time left?

1461
01:23:21,206 --> 01:23:22,486
I think so.

1462
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:24,437
Be sure to remove all
metallic belongings

1463
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,189
and devices that could interact

1464
01:23:26,273 --> 01:23:27,932
with the MRI's powerful magnet.

1465
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:31,497
Hey, uh, dude,

1466
01:23:31,581 --> 01:23:32,951
-Charlie's trying to call...
-Here, man, give me that.

1467
01:23:33,034 --> 01:23:35,011
Here, come on. Sit
down. Sit, sit, sit.

1468
01:23:35,095 --> 01:23:37,058
What the hell? No, I'm
not sitting in that.

1469
01:23:37,142 --> 01:23:38,127
Well, I've got a great idea.

1470
01:23:38,211 --> 01:23:39,664
Okay, there's an
ER down the hall.

1471
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:41,193
So, as soon as you
flatline, boom.

1472
01:23:41,277 --> 01:23:42,420
I'm going to wheel
your ass down there

1473
01:23:42,503 --> 01:23:43,531
and they're going to
bring you right back.

1474
01:23:43,614 --> 01:23:44,965
Hey, where's your EpiPen?

1475
01:23:45,208 --> 01:23:46,936
-It's right here.
-Give it to me.

1476
01:23:47,445 --> 01:23:48,445
Why?

1477
01:23:50,566 --> 01:23:53,055
-What is that?
-Dude, give it. Give it.

1478
01:23:53,139 --> 01:23:55,725
Listen, the whole idea
is you have to die.

1479
01:23:55,809 --> 01:23:58,369
Remember, this keeps
you alive. Now sit.

1480
01:23:59,392 --> 01:24:00,443
Dude, we need to hurry.

1481
01:24:00,527 --> 01:24:02,083
-Come on. Go.
-All right, all right.

1482
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:03,929
All right, eat up.

1483
01:24:05,124 --> 01:24:06,510
Hey, man, um...

1484
01:24:10,082 --> 01:24:12,173
The plan's great, but,

1485
01:24:12,257 --> 01:24:13,447
you know, if it
doesn't work out...

1486
01:24:13,530 --> 01:24:15,081
It's going to work, Bobby.

1487
01:24:15,165 --> 01:24:16,542
Yeah.

1488
01:24:16,626 --> 01:24:18,295
Yeah, but, you
know, just in case,

1489
01:24:18,379 --> 01:24:21,077
and I die for real...

1490
01:24:23,418 --> 01:24:25,030
will you just, um...

1491
01:24:26,167 --> 01:24:28,503
Will you look after Paco?

1492
01:24:28,587 --> 01:24:30,232
Yeah, yeah, of course
I'll look after...

1493
01:24:30,316 --> 01:24:31,340
Dude, I'm just saying, I mean,

1494
01:24:31,423 --> 01:24:33,384
turtles live to be,
like, 100 years old,

1495
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:34,512
and it's a lifetime commitment.

1496
01:24:34,595 --> 01:24:36,555
Look at me. Look at me.

1497
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:38,318
Brother, I'm not going
to take care of Paco

1498
01:24:38,401 --> 01:24:40,054
because you are
going to be okay.

1499
01:24:40,147 --> 01:24:41,012
Me and you,

1500
01:24:41,096 --> 01:24:44,448
we are going to fix things
for everyone right now.

1501
01:24:47,479 --> 01:24:48,542
Look at me.

1502
01:24:50,653 --> 01:24:52,674
I promise you, I'm not
going to let you die.

1503
01:24:54,094 --> 01:24:55,480
Technically, I'm
going to let you die,

1504
01:24:55,563 --> 01:24:56,488
but I'm going to bring you back.

1505
01:24:56,572 --> 01:24:58,869
-Dude, it's not funny.
-I'm just fucking with you.

1506
01:24:59,716 --> 01:25:00,716
Come on.

1507
01:25:01,817 --> 01:25:02,943
You got this.

1508
01:25:32,779 --> 01:25:34,053
Oh, my God.

1509
01:25:34,284 --> 01:25:35,285
What?

1510
01:25:36,809 --> 01:25:37,813
That's really good.

1511
01:25:37,897 --> 01:25:38,749
It's very good, I know.

1512
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:41,486
So, what, other than good,
what are you feeling?

1513
01:25:44,796 --> 01:25:45,796
Nothing.

1514
01:25:45,934 --> 01:25:47,389
You got to be kidding me.

1515
01:25:47,473 --> 01:25:48,928
What, are you telling me
you're not allergic anymore?

1516
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:50,555
-I don't know, man.
-This is perfect, isn't it?

1517
01:25:50,638 --> 01:25:51,806
Maybe I grew out of it.

1518
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:54,309
What, grew out of it? Fuck!

1519
01:25:54,393 --> 01:25:56,813
You know, I don't
have a plan B exactly.

1520
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:03,461
Hey, dude. Hey, hey,
you're doing it.

1521
01:26:03,545 --> 01:26:05,547
Bobby, you're doing it.

1522
01:26:05,631 --> 01:26:06,941
Hey, I'm here with you.

1523
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:08,722
I'm here with you.

1524
01:26:08,806 --> 01:26:10,629
Hey, hey. I can't
give you that, okay?

1525
01:26:10,713 --> 01:26:13,299
Bobby, Bobby. Hey.

1526
01:26:13,383 --> 01:26:14,488
Hey!

1527
01:26:14,572 --> 01:26:15,781
Please.

1528
01:26:15,865 --> 01:26:17,712
Bobby, this is all
part of the plan.

1529
01:26:17,796 --> 01:26:18,996
Just calm down.

1530
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:21,534
Bobby, in the wheelchair.

1531
01:26:25,229 --> 01:26:26,598
Try calling them again.

1532
01:26:28,643 --> 01:26:30,157
This is the only
way we can do...

1533
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:43,991
Ow!

1534
01:26:46,781 --> 01:26:49,034
Ah! Fuck!

1535
01:28:15,876 --> 01:28:18,128
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1536
01:28:18,753 --> 01:28:19,754
Yeah.

1537
01:28:50,603 --> 01:28:54,374
Why is Erik dead if he's
not related to Iris?

1538
01:29:00,244 --> 01:29:02,605
When you fuck with
Death, things get messy.

1539
01:29:07,301 --> 01:29:09,169
We have to get out of here.

1540
01:29:10,843 --> 01:29:12,231
It's not safe.

1541
01:29:13,483 --> 01:29:14,900
And go where?

1542
01:29:15,696 --> 01:29:17,152
Nowhere is safe.

1543
01:29:19,755 --> 01:29:21,299
Except Iris' cabin.

1544
01:29:24,036 --> 01:29:26,729
She was able to survive
there for decades.

1545
01:29:26,813 --> 01:29:28,274
Yeah, and then she got
her face blown off.

1546
01:29:28,357 --> 01:29:31,097
She only died because
she left the cabin.

1547
01:29:31,637 --> 01:29:33,097
Outside is dangerous,

1548
01:29:33,181 --> 01:29:35,573
but inside is the safest
place that there is.

1549
01:29:37,542 --> 01:29:39,452
You're right.

1550
01:29:39,536 --> 01:29:42,122
It's the only place where
we have any advantage.

1551
01:29:44,069 --> 01:29:47,292
So we just lock ourselves
in a cabin forever?

1552
01:29:51,935 --> 01:29:53,167
Not you.

1553
01:29:55,092 --> 01:29:56,092
Me.

1554
01:29:56,980 --> 01:30:00,025
Mom, you can't leave.
We just got you back.

1555
01:30:00,109 --> 01:30:03,727
If anybody's going to live
in that cabin, it's me.

1556
01:30:04,027 --> 01:30:06,224
And as long as I am alive,

1557
01:30:06,955 --> 01:30:08,449
Death can't touch you.

1558
01:30:08,533 --> 01:30:09,696
-Mom.
-Let me do this.

1559
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:11,908
He'll never let you
get there on your own.

1560
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:13,932
But I can see him coming.

1561
01:30:14,823 --> 01:30:16,769
We have to do this together.

1562
01:30:21,552 --> 01:30:22,553
Okay.

1563
01:30:24,483 --> 01:30:25,484
Okay.

1564
01:30:34,201 --> 01:30:35,369
Let's go.

1565
01:30:38,853 --> 01:30:39,853
Yep.

1566
01:30:41,445 --> 01:30:42,654
Okay.

1567
01:30:47,536 --> 01:30:48,579
Watch out!

1568
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:00,110
-You should drive.
-Yeah.

1569
01:32:02,291 --> 01:32:03,598
Holy shit.

1570
01:32:05,174 --> 01:32:06,676
Look at this place.

1571
01:32:11,964 --> 01:32:14,586
It's going to be impossible
to get through that gate.

1572
01:32:34,216 --> 01:32:35,774
He's about to make a move.

1573
01:32:36,496 --> 01:32:37,914
I don't know what it is.

1574
01:32:37,998 --> 01:32:39,625
We need to get you inside now.

1575
01:32:40,484 --> 01:32:41,544
Okay.

1576
01:32:42,210 --> 01:32:43,628
Wait. Wait, what?

1577
01:32:55,811 --> 01:32:56,979
Go!

1578
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:00,351
Stef!

1579
01:33:06,598 --> 01:33:08,116
-Stef!
-Shit!

1580
01:33:20,001 --> 01:33:21,703
Okay. Let's get inside.

1581
01:33:23,070 --> 01:33:24,905
Okay.

1582
01:33:27,065 --> 01:33:28,919
-Shit.
-What?

1583
01:33:35,661 --> 01:33:37,321
-I can help.
-No, no.

1584
01:33:37,405 --> 01:33:38,299
Don't wait for me.

1585
01:33:38,383 --> 01:33:39,356
-Just get inside.
-Stef.

1586
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,895
If you get inside,
I'll be safe. Go.

1587
01:33:41,979 --> 01:33:43,564
Okay. Come on.

1588
01:34:07,190 --> 01:34:08,400
Mom.

1589
01:34:09,724 --> 01:34:10,724
Get down!

1590
01:34:42,322 --> 01:34:44,320
Mom? Mom!

1591
01:34:49,753 --> 01:34:50,754
Wait.

1592
01:35:05,098 --> 01:35:06,475
Okay, okay.

1593
01:35:29,818 --> 01:35:31,683
Mom? Oh, my God.

1594
01:35:32,759 --> 01:35:34,280
Don't worry about me.

1595
01:35:34,871 --> 01:35:36,585
Go save your sister.

1596
01:35:39,128 --> 01:35:40,464
I'm going to stay
alive as long as I...

1597
01:35:54,947 --> 01:35:56,031
Stef!

1598
01:36:53,786 --> 01:36:54,954
No! No!

1599
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:15,320
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1600
01:37:15,404 --> 01:37:16,404
Yeah.

1601
01:37:17,404 --> 01:37:20,449
Just breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1602
01:37:22,774 --> 01:37:23,774
How?

1603
01:37:24,415 --> 01:37:26,584
Charlie. What happened?

1604
01:37:28,126 --> 01:37:29,534
You're okay.

1605
01:37:31,272 --> 01:37:33,873
You died and I brought you back.

1606
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:39,055
You brought me back.

1607
01:37:41,399 --> 01:37:42,785
We're safe now.

1608
01:37:51,326 --> 01:37:52,327
Mom?

1609
01:37:54,781 --> 01:37:56,483
No. No.

1610
01:37:57,375 --> 01:37:58,763
She saved us.

1611
01:38:15,734 --> 01:38:17,047
Let's go home.

1612
01:38:59,213 --> 01:39:00,661
All right, I'm ready.

1613
01:39:03,606 --> 01:39:04,607
Well, there he is.

1614
01:39:04,691 --> 01:39:07,027
Wow. Okay, Charlie.

1615
01:39:07,111 --> 01:39:09,148
All right. Give us
a spin. Mmm-hmm.

1616
01:39:10,252 --> 01:39:12,365
Oh. Mmm-hmm.

1617
01:39:12,796 --> 01:39:14,202
You look really good.

1618
01:39:14,689 --> 01:39:15,964
I have a great stylist.

1619
01:39:16,585 --> 01:39:18,761
Come on, we're going to be late.

1620
01:39:26,625 --> 01:39:27,847
Where's Jenny?

1621
01:39:29,585 --> 01:39:31,473
I think she's still
inside getting ready.

1622
01:39:32,295 --> 01:39:33,788
Here, let me fix this.

1623
01:39:35,847 --> 01:39:37,968
I'm really happy I
could be here for this.

1624
01:39:38,821 --> 01:39:39,864
Me, too.

1625
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:43,901
You okay?

1626
01:39:45,081 --> 01:39:46,082
Yeah.

1627
01:39:51,066 --> 01:39:52,477
-Hi.
-Hello.

1628
01:39:53,815 --> 01:39:55,983
Could I have one cookie, please?

1629
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:30,036
Charlie.

1630
01:40:30,351 --> 01:40:32,058
-Looking sharp.
-Thank you, sir.

1631
01:40:32,142 --> 01:40:34,315
Stef, I want you to meet
Jenny's dad, Dr. Reddick.

1632
01:40:34,434 --> 01:40:35,930
-Hey. Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

1633
01:40:36,014 --> 01:40:36,973
You, too.

1634
01:40:37,057 --> 01:40:38,976
We just adore Charlie.

1635
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:40,605
And I understand he's
quite the lifesaver.

1636
01:40:40,688 --> 01:40:42,459
Oh, yeah. You heard about that.

1637
01:40:42,543 --> 01:40:44,818
He brought me back
from the dead.

1638
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:46,723
Mmm.

1639
01:40:48,265 --> 01:40:49,516
Huh?

1640
01:40:49,793 --> 01:40:51,018
Yeah.

1641
01:40:51,466 --> 01:40:54,064
-What?
-Well, technically, you weren't dead.

1642
01:40:55,479 --> 01:40:56,550
What?

1643
01:40:56,634 --> 01:40:58,141
Well, I mean, if you
were unconscious,

1644
01:40:58,225 --> 01:40:59,715
and Charlie got you
breathing again,

1645
01:40:59,799 --> 01:41:01,437
then your heart didn't stop.

1646
01:41:02,384 --> 01:41:04,876
But regardless,
way to go, Charlie.

1647
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,353
-So she wasn't dead?
-Exactly.

1648
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:12,839
She was lucky
Charlie was there.

1649
01:41:13,306 --> 01:41:15,413
Yep. Everything
happens for a reason.

1650
01:41:15,497 --> 01:41:16,672
Jenny!

1651
01:41:21,008 --> 01:41:23,959
Sweetie, you look
like a million bucks.

1652
01:41:32,553 --> 01:41:33,553
Stef.

1653
01:41:37,899 --> 01:41:39,234
Run!

1654
01:41:51,986 --> 01:41:53,237
Oh, my God, that was close.

1655
01:41:53,321 --> 01:41:54,753
