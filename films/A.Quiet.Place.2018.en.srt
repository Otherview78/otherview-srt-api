1
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,114
He's okay.

2
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,691
Rocket.

3
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:56,362
Very good job!

4
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,282
That's how...

5
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,535
That's how... we'll get away.

6
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,482
Go find your mother.

7
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,786
For the radio?

8
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,040
Might help us boost the signal.

9
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,427
For you.

10
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,470
Thank you.

11
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,559
It'll be dark soon.

13
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,394
Listen to me --

14
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,063
Too loud.

15
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:36,965
S.

16
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:37,758
S.O.

17
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,383
S.O.S.

18
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:39,968
S.

19
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:40,677
S.O.

20
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,303
S.O.S.

21
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:39,935
Dinner.

22
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,293
I'm sorry.

23
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,695
Beautiful.

24
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:28,533
I didn't say anything.

25
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,047
You cannot go down there!

26
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:54,799
Why not?

27
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:56,217
You know why.

28
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,761
I'm not a child! I won't make a sound!

29
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,515
Just don't.

30
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,183
Please.

31
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,489
This time, I took small amplifiers from the stereo.

32
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:19,490
It.

33
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,324
It. Won't.

34
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,409
It. Won't. Work.

35
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:25,121
No, this should increase the frequency to--

36
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,080
It.

37
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,873
It. Never.

38
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:27,582
It. Never. Works!

39
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:28,916
But...

40
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,253
we'll keep trying

41
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,715
until it does.

42
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:48,311
Stop.

43
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,188
Stop.

44
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,190
Just

45
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:56,611
Stop.

46
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,343
Remember, you need to divide.

47
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,146
Carry the three.

48
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:43,366
Amazing!

49
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,293
Time to go.

50
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,261
...please don't make me go...

51
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,430
You'll be fine.

52
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:09,392
Your father will always protect you.

53
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:11,769
Your father will always protect you. Always.

54
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,696
Listen to me...

55
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,782
It's important that you learn these things.

56
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:30,997
He just wants you to be able to take care of yourself.

57
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,753
<i>...to</i> take care of <i>me.</i>

58
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,506
...when I'm old...

59
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:42,883
...and grey...

60
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,888
...and I have no teeth...

61
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,356
Don't worry.

62
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,206
I don't want to go.

63
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:15,833
There's nothing to be scared of.

64
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,793
...of course there is.

65
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:20,588
I'll go.

66
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:27,762
I need you to stay and help your mother.

67
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,651
I want to go.

68
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:44,987
Just stay here.

69
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,239
You'll be safe.

70
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:02,922
...next time.

71
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,671
They'll hear you.

72
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:32,464
They'll hear you.

73
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:37,594
Look at me.

74
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:43,517
Listen.

75
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:45,811
The river...

76
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:46,895
The river... is loud.

77
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,317
Small sounds...

78
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:52,109
Small sounds... safe.

79
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:55,863
Big sounds...

80
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:57,614
Big sounds... not safe.

81
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,200
Unless...

82
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,541
there's another sound nearby...

83
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:10,169
there's another sound nearby... that's louder.

84
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:13,255
You're safe.

85
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,723
I wanna show you something.

86
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,030
Hey,

87
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:03,866
you're all right.

88
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:07,369
You're all right.

89
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,040
I promise.

90
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,831
Why didn't you let her come?

91
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:46,343
Do you blame her

92
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,428
for what happened?

93
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:02,734
No.

94
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,116
Because she blames herself.

95
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:42,316
It was no one's fault.

96
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:02,836
You still love her, right?

97
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:06,882
Of course I do.

98
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,273
You should tell her.

99
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,523
Rocket.

100
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:47,152
I need you...

101
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:48,820
I need you... to make a sound...

102
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,780
I need you... to make a sound... that's louder.

103
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:53,074
Your mother...

104
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:55,243
Your mother... needs your help.

105
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:57,120
You.

106
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:57,787
You. Can.

107
00:49:57,787 --> 00:49:58,580
You. Can. Do this.

108
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:30,364
It's okay. It's okay.

109
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:32,992
You're safe.

110
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,286
They can't hear us.

111
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:39,457
It worked.

112
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:44,128
You just need to rest now.

113
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:55,723
Where are they?

114
00:57:57,892 --> 00:57:59,435
Where are they?

115
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,271
I'll find them.

116
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:09,111
No, she was with me.
She was with me, and...

117
00:58:09,362 --> 00:58:11,781
then I had to go and do laundry, and...

118
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:14,617
He was with you. How did he...

119
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:16,619
Rockets.

120
00:58:20,915 --> 00:58:22,583
So he'd still be there.

121
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:25,544
- I'm sure he is.
- He knows to wait for you.

122
00:58:25,628 --> 00:58:27,463
And she is...

123
00:58:28,089 --> 00:58:30,591
She's smart. She'll have found a place.

124
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,718
They know what to do.

125
00:58:51,821 --> 00:58:53,406
It's a boy.

126
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:57,159
It's a boy.

127
00:59:01,414 --> 00:59:03,249
I could've carried him.

128
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:13,092
He was so heavy, wasn't he?

129
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:19,932
I can still...

130
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,520
I can still feel the weight in my arms.

131
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:27,940
Small, but

132
00:59:28,691 --> 00:59:30,276
so heavy.

133
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,953
And my hands were free.

134
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:48,461
I was carrying the bag,
but my hands were free.

135
00:59:48,544 --> 00:59:50,129
You have to stop.

136
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,217
So, I could've carried him.

137
00:59:58,137 --> 00:59:59,972
I should've carried him.

138
01:00:06,896 --> 01:00:08,481
Who are we

139
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:12,443
if we can't protect them?

140
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,071
Who are we?

141
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:21,243
You have to protect them.

142
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:24,330
Promise me

143
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:27,583
you will protect them.

144
01:02:48,724 --> 01:02:50,309
Don't worry...

145
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:51,602
Don't worry... he'll come for us.

146
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:34,575
We can't stay here.

147
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:36,118
We need to go.

148
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:38,662
He'll come for us.

149
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:42,708
He will come for us.

150
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:45,586
He'll come for <i>you!</i>

151
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:48,005
No, you're wrong.

152
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:48,922
He told me!

153
01:07:14,573 --> 01:07:15,490
Don't move.

154
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:22,664
Stop.

155
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,342
Are you okay?

156
01:11:45,177 --> 01:11:46,219
You okay?

157
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,001
Let's get to the truck.

158
01:13:19,646 --> 01:13:20,814
Dad!

159
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:47,901
I

160
01:14:47,901 --> 01:14:49,027
I love

161
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:50,654
I love you.

162
01:14:55,325 --> 01:14:56,034
I

163
01:14:56,034 --> 01:14:57,118
I have

164
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:59,245
I have always

165
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:00,622
I have always loved

166
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:02,082
I have always loved you.
