1
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:13,997
She's denied the cross for suicide,
and then buried at the center of a crossroads.

2
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,457
Show me the logic.

3
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,418
Father?
What?

4
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,843
The devil is a practical man.

5
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:26,005
If she were a witch,
she was a poor return on his investment.

6
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,391
What do you know of logic?
I have ears, Father.

7
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,598
Although one is notched.
Because I love justice.

8
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,855
You love thieving.

9
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,398
Shut up. You dig.

10
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,375
Crusaders.

11
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,339
Clear the road, if you will.

12
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:46,760
This is for the burial, from my lord.
And a mass, for her soul.

13
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,051
Wait. Have you forgotten?

14
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,063
She was your brother's wife.
She was a suicide. Cut off her head.

15
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,815
And return the ax.

16
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,662
You know this place, my lord?

17
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,712
Know it? I know all of it.

18
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,962
Your brother, you have spoken to him?

19
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,722
On what matter?
He is still arrested.

20
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,806
Your brother is as responsible
for his wife's sin as I am.

21
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,471
Opinions differ, my lord.

22
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,857
The burial was...?
Yes.

23
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,895
Yet you did not mutilate the person?
No.

24
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,690
Good. A law can go too far.

25
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:54,453
It can go too far. I ask myself,
"Would Jesus do it thusly?"

26
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,332
There is so much done in Christendom
of which Christ would be incapable.

27
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,913
Release your brother.
I cannot do without him.

28
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,250
My brother, my lord bishop, uh...

29
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,918
...is possessed by the devil
and must be examined.

30
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,383
Your brother is as mad
as you are. He grieves.

31
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,175
Without your brother, I cannot
finish my church. Let him out.

32
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:23,100
And give him this, and tell him
that he is at the very center of my prayers.

33
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,073
The bishop needs you.

34
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,785
Release him.
On your feet.

35
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,795
This is not heaven, it's the world.
And there's troubles in it.

36
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:49,356
Do yourself no injury.
Other men are always good for that.

37
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,332
- And what of Jerusalem?
- Jerusalem?

38
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,966
In peril, my lord. As always.

39
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,174
We have stood there against
the Saracens for over 100 years.

40
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:23,969
The Saracens, as you call them, have now
unified in Egypt, Syria, and all Arabia.

41
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:28,186
The Saracens and someone new.
Saladin, their king.

42
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,474
Saladin.

43
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,606
Gibberish.

44
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,866
Very fine.
And yet you do not drink.

45
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,780
A knight should be a knight,
a monk a monk.

46
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,331
Now, I may be old-fashioned...

47
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:55,797
...but as for the cup,
I have an artificer, a blacksmith.

48
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,336
Or did have.

49
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:04,016
Which son of the blacksmith of my time
is the blacksmith now?

50
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,179
Balian, the eldest.

51
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:13,444
His child died. His wife fell into a melancholy,
she would not listen to reason.

52
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,695
She killed herself.

53
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:20,450
It occurs. But what's that to you?

54
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,366
A private matter.

55
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,873
It's been six-and-20 years since my
brother took the cross, and now he returns.

56
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,542
An actual baron
of the kingdom of Jerusalem.

57
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,886
How is that for the lot of a younger brother?
With no heir, it comes to me.

58
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,769
And thus to you.
Then I thank the stars for my uncle.

59
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:24,339
Her grave was here. Or was it there? Heh.

60
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:30,513
I'm afraid I can't tell you the exact location.
I wasn't present at the burial.

61
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,485
Call me a liar. You have reason.

62
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,945
You never fight back.

63
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,373
Hmm? Hmm?

64
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:57,456
You always turn the other cheek. I think
that you conceive yourself without sin.

65
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,295
That is a sin.

66
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:16,580
We shall work.

67
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,060
Come on, I told you to stop that now!

68
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:55,449
That is the man, that is the man.
- You're an armorer, yes?

69
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:59,039
An artificer, according to
your lord and this priest.

70
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,000
You have my sympathy and my blessing.

71
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:07,761
Your dead wife and stillborn child
are today the subject of my prayers.

72
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:13,595
We need all these horses shod.
We need food. And we'll pay.

73
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:16,761
He says yes.

74
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,556
Have you killed any?
Have you killed any?

75
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,608
He has made great engines for sieges.

76
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,079
He has made war machines
that cast the largest stones.

77
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,244
He also works finely in silver.

78
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:43,334
He will be one of the few on your journey
worth more alive than dead.

79
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,043
Shut up.

80
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,593
Have you been at war?
On horse.

81
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:00,021
As an engineer also.
Against whom, and for whom did you fight?

82
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:05,860
For one lord against another,
on a point which cannot be remembered.

83
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,489
There's better game now.
One god against another.

84
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,825
The pay is proportionate.
Ha-ha. I've been telling him that.

85
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,206
Do you still advise
what you advised upon the road?

86
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,754
I do, my lord.

87
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,258
But know that this man, Balian,
mourns his wife.

88
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,350
What does that say?

89
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,237
"What man is a man
who does not make the world better?"

90
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,238
Leave me with this man.

91
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,454
God has made us men.
We must suffer all.

92
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,546
I also have lost.

93
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:59,929
Some say Jerusalem is the very center
of the world for asking forgiveness.

94
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:05,768
But myself, I call it here. Now.

95
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,489
I knew your namesake.

96
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:37,303
To be courteous, I should say
that it was against her objections.

97
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,840
But I was the lord's brother
and she had no choice.

98
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,135
But I did not force her.

99
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,066
I have forgiveness to ask of you.

100
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,051
I am Godfrey, the baron of Ibelin.

101
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,554
I have 100 men at arms in Jerusalem.

102
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:25,640
If you will come with me,
you will have a living...

103
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,396
...and you will have my thanks. There it is.

104
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:34,148
Whoever you are, my lord, my place is here.

105
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,530
What made it your place is now dead.

106
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:49,000
You will never see me again.
If you want anything of me, take it now.

107
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,249
I want nothing.

108
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,049
I am sorry for your troubles.
God protect you.

109
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,235
Jerusalem is easy to find.

110
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:26,075
You come to where the men speak Italian,
and continue until they speak something else.

111
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,536
We go by Messina. Goodbye.

112
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,201
The village does not want you.

113
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:16,121
When the old lord is dead,
they will drive you out.

114
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,590
When the bishop is dead, it is certain.

115
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,464
And you take my property.

116
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,883
The Church.
You.

117
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:34,806
They would have taken you to Jerusalem.
Away from all this.

118
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,225
I arranged it.

119
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:45,821
I swear to you, you will have no peace
so long as you stay here.

120
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,496
No man ever needed a new world more.

121
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:55,622
Imagine your sin and pain erased.

122
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,287
All.

123
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,850
If you take the Crusade...

124
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,638
...you may relieve your wife's
position in hell.

125
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:20,731
I put it delicately.
She was a suicide. She is in hell.

126
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,234
Though what she does there
without a head....

127
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,444
Wait here.

128
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:08,050
Have you come to kill me?
Even these days, it is not easy.

129
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,173
Well?

130
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,474
I have done...

131
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,599
...murder.

132
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,811
Haven't we all?

133
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,982
Is it true that in Jerusalem
I can erase my sins?

134
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:35,362
And those of my wife? Is it true?

135
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,871
We can find out together.

136
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,833
Show me your hand.

137
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,506
Pick it up. Let's see what you're made of.

138
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,046
His hand is hurt, my lord.

139
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,259
I once fought two days...

140
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,719
...with an arrow through my testicle.
Ah.

141
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,228
Never use a low guard. You fight well.

142
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,901
Let's work on your skills.

143
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:59,778
Take a high guard...

144
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,413
...like this.

145
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:05,417
The Italians call it <i>la posta del falcone</i>,
the guard of the hawk.

146
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,578
You strike from high. Like this.

147
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,917
Do it. Sword straighter.

148
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,421
Come on. Leg back.
Bend your knees. Sword straighter.

149
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,054
Defend yourself.

150
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,475
The blade isn't the only part of a sword.

151
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:31,439
Attack.

152
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,074
I have your leave?

153
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,790
Pay attention.

154
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,440
What's this?

155
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:31,333
You have with you a man, Balian,
who killed a priest, his brother.

156
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,841
I'm charged by both my father
and the lord bishop to bring him back.

157
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:48,020
What he says is true.
They have the right to take me.

158
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:53,184
I say he's innocent of the charge.
If you say he's guilty, then we'll fight.

159
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:58,527
God will decide the truth of it.
My German friend is a close student of the law.

160
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,407
Just give him to me.
I'll fight you for something else.

161
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:06,698
Uncle, he's a murderer.
So am I.

162
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:14,543
Whoever dies here today,
you will certainly be among them.

163
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,508
You are my uncle. I must give you the road.

164
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,435
Heinrich!

165
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:35,897
To the flanks.

166
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,323
Thank my brother for his love.

167
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,861
I am the son of Roger de—-
Take your helmet off while addressing me.

168
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,919
I am the son of Roger de Cormier.

169
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:51,093
I am accorded the privilege of ransom.

170
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,091
This is true.

171
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,963
Well, you broke the arrow.

172
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:40,271
If the ribs are broken,
the marrow may enter the blood...

173
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,228
...in which case you'll take a fever and die.

174
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:48,362
Or a cyst will form, and you'll live.

175
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:55,744
You're in the hands of God.
Will you get me some more wine?

176
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:12,633
It was not that they had no right to take you.
It was the way they asked.

177
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,465
They had the right to take me.

178
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,011
And so do I.

179
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:43,163
To kill an infidel, the pope has said,
is not murder. It is the path to heaven.

180
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:50,667
To kill an infidel, the pope has said,
is not murder. It is the path to heaven.

181
00:32:56,016 --> 00:33:01,227
To kill an infidel, the pope has said,
is not murder. It is the path to heaven.

182
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,771
Where do you go?
To Jerusalem, brother.

183
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:16,692
By which road?
Someone knows.

184
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,777
God knows.

185
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:37,425
When shall we stop this madness?
It will soon be beyond my concern.

186
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,646
Who is this?

187
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,729
My son.

188
00:33:54,324 --> 00:34:00,411
Would I had fought you when you were
still capable of making bastards. Ha-ha-ha.

189
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,947
I knew your mother
when she was making hers.

190
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,200
Fortunately you're too old to be one of mine.

191
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,129
All will be settled.

192
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,315
Do you know what lies in the Holy Land?

193
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,021
A new world.

194
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:24,870
A man who in France had not a house,
is, in the Holy Land, the master of a city.

195
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,329
He who was the master of a city
begs in the gutter.

196
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,834
There, at the end of the world...

197
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:37,875
...you are not what you were born,
but what you have within yourself to be.

198
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:42,387
I hope to find forgiveness. That's all I know.

199
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:49,765
Whatever your position,
you are of my house.

200
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,978
And that means you will
serve the king of Jerusalem.

201
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,518
What could a king ask of a man like me?

202
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,652
A better world than has ever been seen.

203
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,068
A kingdom of conscience.

204
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,404
A kingdom of heaven.

205
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:11,495
There is peace between
Christian and Muslim.

206
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:17,256
We live together.
Or, between Saladin and the king, we try.

207
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:22,135
Did you think that lay
at the end of a crusade?

208
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,462
It does.

209
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,219
My son, you are all that survives me.
Do not disappoint me.

210
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,476
When we took the Holy Land,
we took the Saracen trading ports.

211
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:44,153
So, Italian ships carry silks and spices,
and pilgrims, if they have money.

212
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,953
And Italy becomes rich,
as the Savior intended.

213
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,796
Who are those men?
Muslims.

214
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,670
Saracens.

215
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:06,301
And they are allowed their prayers?
If they pay the tax.

216
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:13,474
"Praise be to God.
It is proper to praise him."

217
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,979
Sounds like our prayers.

218
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,151
It's good.

219
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:38,958
When the king is dead, Jerusalem
will be no place for friends of Muslims...

220
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:43,717
...or traitors to Christendom, like your father.

221
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,838
I am Guy de Lusignan.

222
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,845
Remember that name.

223
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,975
And me.

224
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,185
Keep it.

225
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:00,854
My lord.

226
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,193
How will you ride
if you have no stick to beat the horse?

227
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,408
He will be king in Jerusalem one day.

228
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,454
Holy mother of God, pray for us...

229
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,087
Balian.

230
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,218
Hurry.

231
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,071
I can go no further.

232
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,535
Get on your knees.

233
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,312
Be without fear in the face of your enemies.

234
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,978
Be brave and upright
that God may love thee.

235
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:31,365
Speak the truth always,
even if it leads to your death.

236
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:35,950
Safeguard the helpless and do no wrong.

237
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,786
That is your oath.

238
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,500
And that's so you remember it.

239
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,137
Rise a knight and Baron of Ibelin.

240
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,027
Defend the king.

241
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:19,327
If the king is no more,
protect the people.

242
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,252
It's time now, my lord,
to confess to God, not your son.

243
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,837
Are you sorry for all your sins?

244
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:33,299
For all but one.

245
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,371
You sail now for Jerusalem,
as your father wished.

246
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:04,204
I'll follow within the week.
Our voyage is perilous.

247
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:08,543
If God has purpose for you there,
he'll keep you safe in his hands.

248
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,090
If not....

249
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,085
God bless you.

250
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,874
He says that is his horse.

251
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:43,545
Why would it be his horse?
Because it is on his land.

252
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,760
I took this horse from the sea.

253
00:44:55,776 --> 00:45:00,896
He says you are a great liar, and he
will fight you because you are a liar.

254
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:05,442
I have no desire to fight.
Then you must give him the horse.

255
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:12,790
No.

256
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,839
Fight me fairly!

257
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:33,766
Why? Why should he?
And I am the baron of Ibelin.

258
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:47,822
He says the baron of Ibelin is old.
He knew him at Damascus.

259
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,326
I am the new one.

260
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:09,839
That's enough!

261
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,057
Stop!

262
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,305
Ibelin, that's enough!

263
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,232
Ibelin! Stop!

264
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,711
You have taken it very well
that I have killed your master.

265
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,547
It was the end of his time.

266
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,714
All is as God wills it.

267
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,220
Now finish this.

268
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,117
Take me to Jerusalem.

269
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,595
Very good horse.

270
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:27,022
Take the horse and be about your business.

271
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:33,616
This is your prize of battle. I am your
prisoner, your slave should you wish it.

272
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:36,823
I have been a slave or very near to one.

273
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:41,491
I will never keep one
nor suffer any to be kept. Go.

274
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:53,503
The man you killed
was a very great cavalier among the Muslims.

275
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:58,008
His name was Mummad al Fais.
I will pray for him.

276
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:04,936
Your quality will be known among your
enemies before ever you meet them, my friend.

277
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:19,529
Old man, where is it
that Christ was crucified?

278
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:07,247
God, what is it you want of me?

279
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:47,162
How can you be in hell
when you're in my heart?

280
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:33,792
You must have known him.
What?

281
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:37,709
Since you carry Godfrey's sword,
you must have known him.

282
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:43,840
I did.
A man my size.

283
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,852
Yes.
And green eyes.

284
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,192
Blue.

285
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,529
Come with us...

286
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:09,870
...my lord.

287
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:34,565
No, no. Give me the towel.

288
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,356
Give me the towel. Give me the towel.

289
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,971
A man who in France had not a house...

290
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:17,607
...is, in the Holy Land, the master of a city.

291
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:52,642
Stop, you're hurting him.

292
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:56,389
Whoa. Whoa.

293
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:17,042
Where's your master?
I have none.

294
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,163
Give me some water.

295
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:36,304
Thank you for the drink.

296
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,360
If you happen to see Balian,
the son of Godfrey...

297
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,395
...tell him that Sibylla called.

298
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:59,535
So how find you Jerusalem?

299
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:06,255
God does not speak to me.
Not even on the hill where Christ died.

300
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,044
I am outside God's grace.

301
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:13,557
I have not heard that.
At any rate, it seems....

302
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:19,730
I have lost my religion.
I put no stock in religion.

303
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,563
By the word "religion" I've seen the lunacy
of fanatics of every denomination...

304
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,398
...be called the will of God.

305
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:30,111
I've seen too much religion
in the eyes of too many murderers.

306
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:34,570
Holiness is in right action...

307
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:38,912
...and courage on behalf of those
who cannot defend themselves.

308
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,992
And goodness...

309
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:49,878
...what God desires is here and here.

310
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:54,048
By what you decide to do every day,
you will be a good man...

311
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,758
...or not.

312
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,094
Come.

313
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,960
The king has made a peace
with Saladin these past six years.

314
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:30,752
He holds Jerusalem
as a place for prayer for all faiths...

315
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,966
...as the Muslims did before we came.

316
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:37,970
These men are Templars. They killed Arabs.

317
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:49,152
So they are dying for what the pope
would command them to do.

318
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:54,659
Yes, but not Christ, I think. Nor this king.

319
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:10,966
Who says I raid?
That witness...

320
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:16,843
...all of Jerusalem, Holy God, and me.

321
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:22,182
That witness, if you call him that,
is a Saracen. He lies.

322
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:27,567
There will come a day, Reynald de Chatillon,
when you are not protected by your title.

323
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:30,690
Oh? When will that be?

324
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:34,823
Alert me, Tiberias, when men are equal
and the kingdom Of Heaven has arrived.

325
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:38,827
Those Templars have been hung
for a raid that I know you commanded.

326
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:43,411
Prove it. I will wait at Kerak until you do.

327
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:47,749
The king will take
your castle of Kerak, Reynald.

328
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:51,882
Try to take it, Tiberias. I'll be there.

329
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:04,349
I cannot protect your caravans
unless you agree to be escorted by our soldiers.

330
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:09,517
I trade to make money, not to
Offend God by associating with Christians.

331
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:13,608
But you will take Christian gold.
Gold is gold.

332
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,319
Of course.

333
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,871
My lord, Tiberias.

334
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,713
My lord.

335
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,090
It's true.

336
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:42,266
You're your father's son.
He was my friend.

337
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,552
I'm yours.

338
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:48,605
Godfrey dead.
It could have come at a better time.

339
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,515
Come.

340
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:55,612
It was shouted in the streets
that you killed a great lord of Syria.

341
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:02,366
Saladin himself sent word
that your fight did not breach the peace...

342
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,951
...that you had cause.

343
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:07,332
What know you of Saladin?

344
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:10,915
That he is king of the Saracens
and that he surrounds this kingdom.

345
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:15,503
He has 200,000 men
in Damascus alone.

346
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,377
He could win a war if he goes to war.

347
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:23,675
And he's daily given cause for war
by fanatics newly from Europe.

348
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:26,434
By Templar bastards
like Reynald de Chatillon.

349
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:30,605
Here, from this room, I keep the peace,
so far as it can be kept.

350
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:37,693
But Saladin and the king between them
would make a better world.

351
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:41,484
If it lives only for a while,
Tiberius, it still has lived.

352
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,576
Oh.

353
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:50,372
What did your father tell you
of your obligations?

354
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,501
That I was to be a good knight.

355
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:58,504
I pray the world and Jerusalem...

356
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:02,296
...can accommodate such a rarity...

357
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,511
...as a perfect knight.

358
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:11,180
Have you dined?

359
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:24,193
The princess Sibylla of Jerusalem
and her husband, Guy de Lusignan.

360
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:38,248
So how many knights
did you find in France?

361
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,041
Fifty.

362
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,006
They've sworn allegiance to the king?

363
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:46,639
Of course, Tiberias. Obviously.

364
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,225
You sit at my table?

365
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,140
Is it not the king's table?

366
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,397
Is it? I have not seen a king at it
for some years.

367
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:03,741
I cannot eat. I am finicky about company.

368
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,073
In France, this could not inherit.

369
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:10,831
But here there are no civilized rules.

370
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,741
I have business in the East.

371
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:19,130
My wife does not lament my absence.

372
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:25,796
That is either the best of wives,
or the very, very worst.

373
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:29,800
Do you go to meet Reynald?
No, my lord. He is in disfavor.

374
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:32,219
I am a member of this court.

375
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:36,310
Why should I make leave
with that troublemaker?

376
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,157
To the very best of wives.

377
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,319
God bless Jerusalem.

378
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,533
My lord, the king will see him now.

379
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,324
The king would see Godfrey's son.

380
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:56,083
I'll take him.

381
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:00,501
This morning,
I spoke without knowing who you were.

382
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,791
I knew who you were.

383
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:07,929
It's unmistakable. I loved your father.

384
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,179
And I shall love you.

385
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,102
Do you fear being with me?

386
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,772
No.

387
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,604
And yes.

388
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,814
A woman in my place has two faces.

389
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:31,412
One for the world,
and one which she wears in private.

390
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,323
With you, I'll be only Sibylla.

391
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:42,501
Tiberias thinks me unpredictable.

392
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:45,759
I am unpredictable.

393
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,346
No. There.

394
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,650
Come forward.

395
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:13,074
I am glad to meet Godfrey's son.
He was one of my greatest teachers.

396
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:18,034
He was there when,
playing with the other boys, my arm was cut.

397
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:23,001
And it was he, not my father's physicians,
who noticed that I felt no pain.

398
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:30,634
He wept when he gave my father
the news that I am a leper.

399
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:39,855
The Saracens say that this disease is God's
vengeance against the vanity of our kingdom.

400
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:42,892
As wretched as I am, these Arabs believe...

401
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:49,030
...that the chastisement that awaits me in hell
is far more severe and lasting.

402
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,068
If that's true, I call it unfair.

403
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:56,241
Come, sit.

404
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,409
Do you play?
No.

405
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:07,458
The whole world is in chess.
Any move can be the death of you.

406
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:13,430
Do anything except remain where you
started, and you can't be sure of your end.

407
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,049
Were you sure of your end once?

408
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:20,600
I was.
What was it?

409
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,267
To be buried 100 yards
from where I was born.

410
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:30,401
And now?
Now I sit in Jerusalem, and look upon a king.

411
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:38,576
When I was 16, I won a great victory.

412
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:42,333
I felt in that moment I would live to be 100.

413
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:46,296
Now I know I shall not see 30.

414
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:54,305
None of us know our end, really.
Or what hand will guide us there.

415
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:57,136
A king may move a man.

416
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,180
A father may claim a son.

417
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:07,318
That man can also move himself, and only
then does that man truly begin his own game.

418
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:11,320
Remember that howsoever
you are played, or by whom...

419
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:14,483
...your soul is in your keeping alone.

420
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:18,279
Even though those who presume
to play you be kings or men of power.

421
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:26,212
When you stand before God, you cannot say,
"But I was told by others to do thus."

422
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:29,873
Or that virtue was not
convenient at the time.

423
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:34,010
This will not suffice. Remember that.

424
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,259
I will.

425
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:43,186
Do you know what this is?
The fortification.

426
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,641
What do you think of it?

427
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,896
You disapprove.
How would you improve it?

428
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:54,315
A cross. Or better, a star. Like this.

429
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,949
That way, no part of the fortress
may be approached...

430
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,611
...without being exposed
to fire from another part.

431
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:03,327
Yes, I like this.
Your walls are more difficult to address.

432
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:11,210
Very good. You will go to your father's
house at Ibelin, your house now...

433
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:15,051
...and then from there you will
protect the pilgrim road.

434
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:18,634
Safeguard, in particular,
the Jews and the Muslims.

435
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,595
All are welcome in Jerusalem...

436
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:25,432
...not only because it's expedient,
but because it is right.

437
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:31,230
Protect the helpless, and then maybe one day
when I am helpless...

438
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,440
...you will come and protect me.

439
01:07:56,531 --> 01:08:00,490
There, my lord. Ibelin.

440
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:03,420
"Such as we are, you will be."

441
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:41,959
Your father was important.
His lands were not.

442
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,631
That will suit me.

443
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:53,390
My lord, you have 1000 acres, 100 families.

444
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:58,274
You have Christians, Jews, Muslims.

445
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:03,404
You have 50 pairs of oxen.
This is a poor and dusty place.

446
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:07,325
What we do not have is water.

447
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:16,852
Right. Stone the walls.

448
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,873
I'm on my way to Cana.

449
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:24,874
Where Jesus changed water to wine.

450
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:29,421
But a better trick would be
to change you to a nobleman.

451
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:33,759
That should be easy. In France,
a few yards of silk can make a nobleman.

452
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,933
I expect your hospitality.

453
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:39,476
It is given.

454
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:40,724
Latif.

455
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:32,090
But this isn't adultery. It's washing.

456
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:43,427
But if it were adultery, which it isn't,
the Commandments are not for people like us.

457
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:45,435
They're for the others.

458
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:49,228
Did they give you something to eat?

459
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:52,235
I said to wait until the master returned.

460
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:58,074
My cook will prepare something
while you wash.

461
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:27,596
What?
It seems years since I've seen a woman eat.

462
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,225
Truly?

463
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,774
I was watching you today.

464
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:42,319
You've been given a patch of dirt and
it seems you will build a new Jerusalem here.

465
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:44,612
It is my land.

466
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:49,499
Who would I be
if I did not try to make it better?

467
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:12,482
They try to be one.
One heart, one morality.

468
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:15,438
Their prophet says, "Submit."

469
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:17,069
Jesus says:

470
01:16:19,069 --> 01:16:21,069
"Decide."

471
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,692
Did you decide on Guy?

472
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,872
Guy was chosen by my mother.

473
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:31,830
My first husband died
before our son was born.

474
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,291
I was only 15.

475
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:39,216
I've met your son.

476
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:25,615
I could stay here forever.
This house is yours.

477
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:28,450
Why do you think I'm here?

478
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:42,457
I know that Ibelin
is not on the way to Cana.

479
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:47,254
What else do you know, my lord?
I know that you are a princess.

480
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:51,848
And I am no lord.
You're a knight.

481
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:55,011
Neither earned nor proved.

482
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:05,146
I'm not here with you
because I'm bored or wicked.

483
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,365
I'm here because...

484
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:13,746
Because in the East,
between one person and another...

485
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:16,786
...there is only light.

486
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:31,737
Halt!

487
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:38,952
This caravan is armed, Reynald.
Good. No sport otherwise.

488
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:42,869
They've seen us.

489
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:47,623
Go after them. The rider is getting away.
Nothing will come of it.

490
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:50,759
I'd prefer not to be hanged
before my wife is queen.

491
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:54,217
Don't worry. "Who but Reynald", they'll say.

492
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:57,303
It's always me. They'll believe it
in Jerusalem, I assure you.

493
01:20:57,478 --> 01:21:01,721
You were at Nazareth, praying.
You're a dangerous man, Reynald.

494
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:05,107
If the war's to be now or later,
I would have it now.

495
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:08,895
How long can the leper last?
God wills it. God wills it!

496
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:11,564
Jerusalem!
Jerusalem!

497
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,512
It's you.

498
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:26,013
This is from France. I've never been there.

499
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:30,855
This from my brother.
This to remind us of death.

500
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,645
And this...

501
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,653
...I bought the day I saw you.

502
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:41,452
You lie.

503
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:13,277
Guy de Lusignan
and Reynald de Chatillon...

504
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:16,610
...with the Templars,
have attacked a Saracen caravan.

505
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:17,818
Liar!

506
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:23,905
- Silence!
- It was no caravan.

507
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:27,582
It was an army headed for Bethlehem
to desecrate our lord's birthplace.

508
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:31,792
Reynald, with the Templars,
have broken the king's pledge of peace.

509
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:34,122
Saladin will come into this kingdom--

510
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:38,920
Tiberias knows more than a Christian
should about Saladin's intentions.

511
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:47,595
That I would rather live with men
than kill them...

512
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:51,064
...is certainly why you are alive.

513
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:54,443
That sort of Christianity
has its uses, I suppose.

514
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:57,946
We must not go to war with Saladin.

515
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:00,824
We do not want it and we may not win it.

516
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:02,074
Blasphemy!

517
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:09,950
An army of Jesus Christ which bears
his holy cross cannot be beaten.

518
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:13,458
Does the Count of Tiberias
suggest it could be?

519
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:16,127
There must be war. God wills it.

520
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,964
God wills it!

521
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:35,150
Silence!

522
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:48,155
Saladin has crossed the Jordan
with 200,000 men.

523
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:54,875
He'll make first for Kerak
and Reynald de Chatillon. My lord....

524
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:05,552
We must meet him before he reaches Kerak.

525
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:07,553
I will lead the army.

526
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:12,179
My lord, if you travel, you'll die.

527
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:15,520
Send word to Balian
to protect the villagers.

528
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,195
Assemble the army.

529
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,588
What becomes of us?

530
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:46,380
The world will decide.

531
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:12,998
My lord, the king is marching on Kerak.

532
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:40,438
Saracen cavalry, they're coming
to close Reynald in.

533
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:45,823
These people are not safe outside the walls.
Saladin will certainly come behind them.

534
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:01,463
Go into the fortress now.

535
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,759
...

536
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:15,094
...

537
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:35,371
Visitors.

538
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:47,713
My lord Balian.

539
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:50,880
My lord Balian.

540
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:54,800
My lord Reynald prays
you bring your force into Kerak.

541
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:58,391
Thank you, but no.
If we do, these people will die.

542
01:27:58,565 --> 01:28:01,898
We'll hold the Saracen cavalry
until the king arrives.

543
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:03,354
So be it.

544
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,907
We cannot attack that and live.

545
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:14,782
My lady.

546
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:20,250
What do you look at?
A knight.

547
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:23,541
His men.

548
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:32,550
Are you with me?

549
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:52,246
Your quality will be known among your
enemies before ever you meet them, my friend.

550
01:31:56,511 --> 01:32:01,722
You were not that man's servant.
No, he was my servant.

551
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:14,981
What becomes of us?
As you deserve.

552
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:18,070
You reap what you sow.

553
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:21,529
You have heard of this, no?

554
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:24,115
Get up.

555
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:42,505
You may go into Kerak,
but you will die there.

556
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:45,298
My master is here.

557
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:09,205
Tell my lord Saladin
that Jerusalem has come.

558
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:11,934
Saladin.

559
01:34:34,878 --> 01:34:39,042
I pray you pull back your cavalry
and leave this matter to me.

560
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:43,417
I pray you retire unharmed to Damascus.

561
01:34:44,012 --> 01:34:48,631
Reynald of Chatillon
will be punished. I swear it.

562
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:52,016
Withdraw or we will all die here.

563
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:06,105
Do we have terms?

564
01:35:10,413 --> 01:35:12,369
We have terms.

565
01:35:19,672 --> 01:35:23,130
I will send you my physicians.

566
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:51,484
I am Reynald of Chatillon!

567
01:36:31,995 --> 01:36:33,201
On your knees.

568
01:36:36,582 --> 01:36:37,697
Lower.

569
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:44,879
I am Jerusalem.

570
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:50,210
And you, Reynald...

571
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:53,130
...will give me the kiss of peace.

572
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:13,733
Guard.

573
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:25,123
What are you looking at?
A dead man.

574
01:37:25,298 --> 01:37:30,418
Reynald de Chatillon,
you are arrested and condemned.

575
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:52,777
If you continue like this,
I shall have to find a use for you.

576
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:57,114
If God can spare you, that is.
God does not know me.

577
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:58,824
Yes, but I do.

578
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:25,180
I need you in Jerusalem.

579
01:41:58,863 --> 01:42:02,026
Why did we retire?

580
01:42:03,326 --> 01:42:05,112
Why?

581
01:42:05,286 --> 01:42:09,620
God did not favor him.
God alone determines the results of battles.

582
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:16,002
The results of battles are determined by God,
but also by preparation, numbers...

583
01:42:16,172 --> 01:42:19,960
...the absence of disease
and the availability of water.

584
01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:24,169
One cannot maintain a siege
with the enemy behind.

585
01:42:24,347 --> 01:42:28,886
How many battles did God win
for the Muslims before I came?

586
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:34,350
That is, before God
determined that I should come.

587
01:42:34,523 --> 01:42:37,390
Few enough.

588
01:42:38,444 --> 01:42:41,436
That's because we were sinful.

589
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:45,565
It is because you were unprepared.

590
01:42:46,285 --> 01:42:51,029
If you think that way,
you shall not be king for long.

591
01:42:55,294 --> 01:42:59,458
When I'm not king, I quake for Islam.

592
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:03,708
Thank you for your visit.

593
01:43:06,472 --> 01:43:10,636
Thank you for your visit.

594
01:43:14,438 --> 01:43:16,554
You promised.

595
01:43:16,732 --> 01:43:19,815
You promised to return Jerusalem.

596
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:24,395
Don't forget.

597
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:42,337
If I do not deliver war, I have no peace.

598
01:43:42,508 --> 01:43:45,420
The king of Jerusalem will die soon.

599
01:43:45,594 --> 01:43:50,054
When he is dead, the boy will become
king of a kingdom he cannot control.

600
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:54,843
The Christians will make the war you need.

601
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:56,946
I am Reynald of Chatillon!

602
01:44:59,877 --> 01:45:02,994
I am Reynald of Chatillon!

603
01:45:04,465 --> 01:45:06,547
Reynald of Chatillon!

604
01:45:09,011 --> 01:45:11,673
I-- I am...

605
01:45:12,973 --> 01:45:15,965
...Reynald of Chatillon!

606
01:45:17,228 --> 01:45:24,066
The things that we have left
undone plague us as death comes.

607
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:29,070
That is why to the dying
there is no comfort but the Lord.

608
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:32,198
Spare me your sermon.

609
01:45:32,368 --> 01:45:37,704
Go and prepare your people
for the coronation of my nephew.

610
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:41,240
Your confession, my lord.

611
01:45:41,418 --> 01:45:44,581
I shall confess to God when I see him...

612
01:45:47,466 --> 01:45:50,424
...not to you.

613
01:45:51,136 --> 01:45:54,173
Now, leave me.

614
01:46:09,363 --> 01:46:11,274
...

615
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:42,552
You sometimes dream you are my wife.

616
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:45,472
Let's pretend you are.

617
01:47:22,978 --> 01:47:26,015
I must go.

618
01:47:29,902 --> 01:47:32,814
We can't meet in the city.

619
01:47:32,988 --> 01:47:36,105
Then we will leave it.

620
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:39,491
And live how? Live where?

621
01:47:39,662 --> 01:47:44,031
Balian, my brother's dying.

622
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,835
My son will be king, and I his regent.
I must rule for him.

623
01:47:50,005 --> 01:47:56,547
And not just in Jerusalem,
but Ankara, Ashkelon, Beirut....

624
01:47:59,014 --> 01:48:01,380
And Guy?

625
01:48:29,003 --> 01:48:33,212
Always surround your knights
with foot soldiers.

626
01:48:35,759 --> 01:48:38,045
These rooms are not yours.

627
01:48:41,181 --> 01:48:45,390
One day I will be the husband
I was commissioned to be.

628
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:48,598
And perhaps not, my dear.

629
01:48:48,772 --> 01:48:52,936
Your lover has 100 knights
and the love of the king.

630
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:59,276
I, the largest force in the kingdom
and the support of the Templars.

631
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:03,068
I can do without the king's affection.

632
01:49:03,245 --> 01:49:05,281
But as for your love....

633
01:49:14,757 --> 01:49:17,794
Then we must come to an understanding.

634
01:49:17,968 --> 01:49:22,837
You need my knights,
or his rule will be bloody and brief.

635
01:49:36,904 --> 01:49:42,774
So, my friend, the time has come
to conclude my affairs.

636
01:49:42,951 --> 01:49:48,787
If I leave the army with Guy, he will
take power and make war on the Muslims.

637
01:49:48,957 --> 01:49:53,826
We have decided that you shall take
command of the army of Jerusalem.

638
01:49:54,004 --> 01:49:58,839
Will you defend my nephew while he's king?

639
01:49:59,009 --> 01:50:01,500
Whatever you ask, I will serve.

640
01:50:01,678 --> 01:50:04,761
No. Hear it all before you answer.

641
01:50:06,725 --> 01:50:12,311
Would you marry my sister Sibylla,
were she free of Guy de Lusignan?

642
01:50:13,273 --> 01:50:15,184
And Guy?

643
01:50:15,776 --> 01:50:18,859
He will be executed.

644
01:50:19,029 --> 01:50:24,524
Along with his knights
who do not swear your allegiance.

645
01:50:26,161 --> 01:50:32,782
I cannot be the cause of that.
"Whatever you ask, I will serve."

646
01:50:36,296 --> 01:50:39,663
A king may move a man, you said.

647
01:50:40,676 --> 01:50:44,464
But the soul belongs to the man.

648
01:50:45,305 --> 01:50:47,216
Yes, I did.

649
01:50:48,016 --> 01:50:51,349
You have my love and my answer.

650
01:50:52,563 --> 01:50:53,928
Uh....

651
01:50:54,189 --> 01:50:56,396
So be it.

652
01:50:56,567 --> 01:50:58,979
Why do you protect Guy? Hm?

653
01:50:59,153 --> 01:51:02,691
He's a man who insults you, hates you.

654
01:51:02,865 --> 01:51:05,698
He'd kill you himself if he had the chance.

655
01:51:05,868 --> 01:51:12,865
But for the salvation of this kingdom,
would it be so hard to marry Sibylla?

656
01:51:14,168 --> 01:51:18,502
Jerusalem has no need of a perfect knight.

657
01:51:18,672 --> 01:51:22,460
No. It is a kingdom of conscience.

658
01:51:23,302 --> 01:51:25,793
Or nothing.

659
01:51:43,572 --> 01:51:45,654
Sibylla.

660
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:00,787
Who are you to refuse a king?

661
01:52:00,964 --> 01:52:04,627
I will have power,
without Guy or with him.

662
01:52:04,801 --> 01:52:09,044
Guy isn't dead at your say-so,
or my brother's, but at mine.

663
01:52:11,767 --> 01:52:14,850
Do you have any idea of Jerusalem,
except that it is yours?

664
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:18,228
You will never hold it in peace,
as your brother did.

665
01:52:18,398 --> 01:52:23,734
It will be war.
My grandfather took Jerusalem in blood.

666
01:52:23,904 --> 01:52:27,738
I'll keep it the same way, or any way I can.

667
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:31,992
I am what I am.
I offer you that.

668
01:52:33,163 --> 01:52:36,155
And the world.

669
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:43,746
You say no.

670
01:52:45,384 --> 01:52:47,921
Do you think I'm like Guy?

671
01:52:48,095 --> 01:52:51,587
That I would sell my soul?

672
01:52:58,397 --> 01:53:03,391
There'll be a day when you will wish
you had done a little evil...

673
01:53:03,568 --> 01:53:07,152
...to do a greater good.

674
01:53:12,286 --> 01:53:14,197
Reynald.

675
01:53:22,004 --> 01:53:24,086
My lord.

676
01:54:04,379 --> 01:54:10,500
Do you really think the king wants you
as head of the army once he's gone? Hm?

677
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:14,635
Think your wife does?

678
01:54:19,269 --> 01:54:23,387
I have a problem.
Ah, yes. Balian.

679
01:54:23,774 --> 01:54:26,265
I saw him at Kerak.

680
01:54:27,319 --> 01:54:29,981
Celebrated.

681
01:54:30,155 --> 01:54:33,898
You must beware a popular man.

682
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:36,904
Kill him.

683
01:54:43,251 --> 01:54:45,287
- What's that?
- England.

684
01:54:45,462 --> 01:54:48,704
- The king?
- Richard, and his father was Henry.

685
01:54:48,882 --> 01:54:53,467
Good. And that?
France. Will I ever see France?

686
01:54:53,637 --> 01:54:56,879
Maybe one day.
But you must be king here.

687
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:03,469
How many islands can you see here?
One, two....

688
01:55:03,647 --> 01:55:07,014
The king will see you.
No, I can't.

689
01:55:07,192 --> 01:55:10,559
I can't bear to look at him.
He knows this.

690
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:13,319
It doesn't mean I don't love him.

691
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:16,026
Go, madam.

692
01:56:52,339 --> 01:56:54,330
Oh.

693
01:56:55,258 --> 01:56:57,465
Hello.

694
01:56:59,971 --> 01:57:02,087
I was dreaming.

695
01:57:02,891 --> 01:57:08,227
I was back in that summer
when I defeated Saladin.

696
01:57:09,147 --> 01:57:11,638
Do you remember it?

697
01:57:11,816 --> 01:57:14,273
I was only 16.

698
01:57:14,444 --> 01:57:17,936
You were a beautiful boy.
Yes.

699
01:57:18,114 --> 01:57:20,355
You've always been beautiful.

700
01:57:22,369 --> 01:57:25,076
In every way.

701
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:32,080
My beautiful sister.
I've missed you.

702
01:57:32,587 --> 01:57:35,294
So beautiful.

703
01:57:36,132 --> 01:57:39,670
I'm sorry if I've caused you any pain.

704
01:57:42,097 --> 01:57:45,089
Remember me as I was.

705
01:57:47,018 --> 01:57:49,225
I will.

706
01:58:39,946 --> 01:58:42,107
Sibylla.

707
01:58:56,254 --> 01:59:00,213
If my son has your knights...

708
01:59:02,135 --> 01:59:04,421
...you have your wife.

709
02:00:27,429 --> 02:00:32,549
Behold your rightful king and heir to
the throne of the kingdom of Jerusalem.

710
02:00:32,726 --> 02:00:36,310
Hail! Hail! Hail!

711
02:00:39,315 --> 02:00:41,226
Long live the king!

712
02:00:41,401 --> 02:00:45,485
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

713
02:01:00,128 --> 02:01:03,746
One may stare into the light,
until one becomes the light.

714
02:01:03,923 --> 02:01:06,881
I've done it many times.

715
02:01:13,308 --> 02:01:18,428
There's your religion.
One spark, a creosote bush.

716
02:01:21,274 --> 02:01:25,643
There's your Moses.
I did not hear it speak.

717
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:29,483
That does not mean that there is no God.

718
02:01:29,657 --> 02:01:33,149
Do you love her?
Yes.

719
02:01:33,328 --> 02:01:37,287
The heart will mend.
Your duty is to the people of the city.

720
02:01:38,374 --> 02:01:41,161
I go to pray.
For what?

721
02:01:44,380 --> 02:01:47,793
For the strength to endure what is to come.

722
02:01:47,967 --> 02:01:50,003
And what is to come?

723
02:01:50,178 --> 02:01:53,966
The reckoning is to come
for what was done 100 years before.

724
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:57,132
The Muslims will never forget.

725
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:03,346
Nor should they.

726
02:02:33,930 --> 02:02:36,922
My lady, your letter to Saladin.

727
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:41,890
Peace to be sustained, borders respected,
trade allowed to continue.

728
02:02:42,063 --> 02:02:45,180
Is this wise?
To show your intentions?

729
02:02:45,358 --> 02:02:48,725
Better, surely, to let him wonder?

730
02:02:48,903 --> 02:02:52,111
We keep my brother's peace.
Sign.

731
02:03:03,877 --> 02:03:06,038
Take the seal.

732
02:03:07,964 --> 02:03:11,127
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Be careful.

733
02:03:22,478 --> 02:03:25,595
Put it back, my darling.

734
02:03:38,494 --> 02:03:41,531
Hey! Ha, ha, ha!

735
02:04:11,194 --> 02:04:13,981
There is a rumor.

736
02:04:14,155 --> 02:04:17,113
We must condemn it immediately.

737
02:04:17,283 --> 02:04:21,367
Call it treason.
And kill those who whisper it.

738
02:04:21,537 --> 02:04:25,871
The rumor will die
if we show the boy as active--

739
02:04:28,878 --> 02:04:32,120
How long before he wears a mask?

740
02:04:33,758 --> 02:04:36,750
Will you have one made for him?

741
02:04:37,345 --> 02:04:41,884
How did my boy deserve it?

742
02:04:45,478 --> 02:04:48,561
Jerusalem is dead, Tiberias.

743
02:04:50,566 --> 02:04:53,979
No kingdom is worth my son alive in hell.

744
02:04:55,905 --> 02:04:59,318
I will go to hell instead.

745
02:05:21,848 --> 02:05:25,056
Do you remember the story of Louan?
No.

746
02:05:25,226 --> 02:05:26,682
No?

747
02:05:26,853 --> 02:05:29,310
Do you remember why?
No.

748
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:33,723
And he was so lonely that...

749
02:05:33,901 --> 02:05:36,483
...he called all the gods.
Why?

750
02:07:23,719 --> 02:07:27,712
Is this why you came
to the Holy Land? Come on!

751
02:07:52,373 --> 02:07:54,079
Leave us.

752
02:07:58,754 --> 02:08:02,338
The boy is in heaven?
Yes.

753
02:08:03,259 --> 02:08:06,217
His mother has more backbone than I do.

754
02:08:06,387 --> 02:08:10,596
She's in the crypt,
and will not come out.

755
02:08:12,768 --> 02:08:17,262
Have the Templars killed Balian?
Yes.

756
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:19,931
Reynald....

757
02:08:20,109 --> 02:08:22,100
Give me a war.

758
02:08:23,613 --> 02:08:26,400
That is what I do.

759
02:08:28,701 --> 02:08:32,865
Behold your rightful queen and heir
to the throne of the kingdom of Jerusalem.

760
02:08:33,039 --> 02:08:35,621
Hail! Hail! Hail!

761
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:44,631
Choose as king Guy de Lusignan,
the man who has been my husband.

762
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:48,793
With the help of God,
he will rule his people well.

763
02:08:52,934 --> 02:08:55,516
Long live the king in prosperity.

764
02:08:55,686 --> 02:09:01,727
Long live the king.
Long live the king. Long live the king.

765
02:09:24,757 --> 02:09:27,339
I am what I am.

766
02:09:27,510 --> 02:09:29,501
Someone has to be.

767
02:09:54,078 --> 02:09:56,364
Saladin's sister.

768
02:09:57,832 --> 02:09:59,663
I know.

769
02:10:19,395 --> 02:10:21,477
I know.

770
02:10:47,882 --> 02:10:50,544
Speak.

771
02:10:55,264 --> 02:10:58,006
The sultan demands
the return Of his sister's body...

772
02:10:58,184 --> 02:11:02,598
the heads of those responsible
and the surrender of Jerusalem.

773
02:11:07,026 --> 02:11:09,108
Does he?

774
02:11:10,196 --> 02:11:13,529
What answer do you return to Saladin?

775
02:11:24,377 --> 02:11:25,958
This.

776
02:11:42,770 --> 02:11:45,682
Take the head to Damascus.

777
02:11:52,613 --> 02:11:54,945
I am Jerusalem.

778
02:11:59,328 --> 02:12:01,785
Assemble the army!

779
02:12:25,104 --> 02:12:30,690
Now this assembly of barons
and all Jerusalem is complete.

780
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:35,695
There are those among you who may
disagree with our succession...

781
02:12:35,948 --> 02:12:38,360
...but it is war.

782
02:12:39,368 --> 02:12:42,201
And I am...

783
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:47,031
...the king.

784
02:12:47,209 --> 02:12:48,870
We march at once.

785
02:12:49,044 --> 02:12:51,535
What say this council?
- Aye!

786
02:12:52,965 --> 02:12:59,177
No. If you must have war,
this army cannot move away from water.

787
02:13:00,347 --> 02:13:03,214
You have a chance to hold the city.

788
02:13:03,392 --> 02:13:06,759
But if you move out against Saladin...

789
02:13:06,937 --> 02:13:10,270
...this army will be destroyed
and the city left defenseless.

790
02:13:10,441 --> 02:13:15,526
When I wish a blacksmith
to advise me in war, I will tell him.

791
02:13:15,696 --> 02:13:18,984
Saladin wants you to come out.

792
02:13:21,202 --> 02:13:26,071
He is waiting for you to make that mistake.
He knows his men.

793
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:29,202
We should meet the enemies Of God.
- Aye!

794
02:13:29,376 --> 02:13:31,583
And so we shall.

795
02:13:31,754 --> 02:13:35,087
Then you do so without my knights.

796
02:13:35,257 --> 02:13:41,173
Then I will have the glory, Tiberias.
You had yours years and years ago.

797
02:13:41,931 --> 02:13:43,922
It's time for mine.

798
02:14:12,461 --> 02:14:14,577
Tiberias.

799
02:14:16,549 --> 02:14:19,916
When Saladin has finished with Guy,
he will come.

800
02:14:20,094 --> 02:14:22,631
We must look to the defenses.

801
02:14:22,805 --> 02:14:25,467
The boy's dead.

802
02:14:29,895 --> 02:14:34,229
Guy.
No. The boy was leprous like his uncle.

803
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:39,144
She gave him peace.
She let him go.

804
02:14:41,448 --> 02:14:45,316
And Jerusalem along with him.

805
02:14:51,500 --> 02:14:55,834
You go with the army?
My order is with the army.

806
02:14:56,964 --> 02:15:00,957
You go to certain death.
All death is certain.

807
02:15:01,135 --> 02:15:04,798
I shall tell your father
what I've seen you become.

808
02:15:46,889 --> 02:15:49,722
When Saladin comes...

809
02:15:50,476 --> 02:15:53,388
...we're not defensible.

810
02:15:55,064 --> 02:15:58,352
Save the people from what I have done.

811
02:15:59,026 --> 02:16:01,312
I will.

812
02:17:03,465 --> 02:17:06,002
God wills it.

813
02:17:34,830 --> 02:17:39,824
Can you sense it?
There has been no messenger.

814
02:19:00,916 --> 02:19:03,749
I drink water for what it is.

815
02:19:07,631 --> 02:19:12,716
I did not give the cup to you.
No, my lord.

816
02:20:22,497 --> 02:20:25,614
A king does not kill a king.

817
02:20:25,792 --> 02:20:31,833
Were you not close enough to a great king
to learn by his example?

818
02:21:08,043 --> 02:21:13,458
I have given Jerusalem
my whole life. Everything.

819
02:21:15,676 --> 02:21:20,887
First, I thought we were fighting for God.

820
02:21:21,348 --> 02:21:25,717
Then I realized
we were fighting for wealth and land.

821
02:21:25,894 --> 02:21:28,385
I was ashamed.

822
02:21:36,071 --> 02:21:41,486
Tiberias.
There is no more Jerusalem.

823
02:21:42,536 --> 02:21:46,495
I shall go to Cyprus.
Will you come with me?

824
02:21:47,249 --> 02:21:49,240
No.

825
02:21:49,418 --> 02:21:52,285
You are your father's son.

826
02:21:54,506 --> 02:21:58,044
Saladin must move his army
from water to water.

827
02:21:58,218 --> 02:22:02,336
That gives you four days, maybe five.

828
02:22:03,724 --> 02:22:06,261
God be with you.

829
02:22:06,435 --> 02:22:09,222
He is no longer with me.

830
02:23:02,908 --> 02:23:06,366
Mark four hundred.
Four hundred.

831
02:23:06,536 --> 02:23:08,572
Four hundred!

832
02:23:23,261 --> 02:23:26,845
They're here.
It is only one man.

833
02:23:30,352 --> 02:23:33,185
No. They're here.

834
02:23:54,209 --> 02:23:59,579
This is the only section they can attack
once they begin to bombard the walls.

835
02:23:59,756 --> 02:24:03,669
They will stop only to avoid hitting
their own siege towers as they come in.

836
02:24:03,844 --> 02:24:08,178
We'll take the bombardment.
When they cease firing, we fire.

837
02:24:11,726 --> 02:24:14,559
We must leave the city.

838
02:24:14,729 --> 02:24:20,725
How exactly, my lord bishop?
The fastest horses from a lesser gate.

839
02:24:20,902 --> 02:24:23,564
And the people?
It is unfortunate about the people...

840
02:24:23,738 --> 02:24:25,979
...but it is God's will.

841
02:24:34,666 --> 02:24:36,952
Silence!

842
02:24:45,093 --> 02:24:49,257
It has fallen to us
to defend Jerusalem...

843
02:24:49,431 --> 02:24:53,765
...and we have made our preparations
as well as they can be made.

844
02:24:55,228 --> 02:24:58,846
None of us took this city from Muslims.

845
02:25:00,066 --> 02:25:07,063
No Muslim of the great army now coming
against us was born when this city was lost.

846
02:25:09,075 --> 02:25:13,614
We fight over an offense we did not give...

847
02:25:14,206 --> 02:25:18,996
...against those who were
not alive to be offended.

848
02:25:19,169 --> 02:25:21,626
What is Jerusalem?

849
02:25:21,796 --> 02:25:27,462
Your holy places lie over the Jewish temple
that the Romans pulled down.

850
02:25:27,636 --> 02:25:31,800
The Muslim places of worship lie over yours.

851
02:25:33,433 --> 02:25:35,924
Which is more holy?

852
02:25:37,646 --> 02:25:41,309
The wall? The mosque?

853
02:25:41,483 --> 02:25:44,896
The sepulcher?
Who has claim?

854
02:25:46,988 --> 02:25:49,400
No one has claim.

855
02:25:49,574 --> 02:25:51,530
All have claim.

856
02:25:51,701 --> 02:25:53,783
That is blasphemy!
Be quiet.

857
02:25:53,954 --> 02:25:58,664
We defend this city,
not to protect these stones...

858
02:25:58,833 --> 02:26:01,950
...but the people living within these walls.

859
02:26:24,109 --> 02:26:25,940
My lord.

860
02:26:26,111 --> 02:26:28,022
My lord. My lord.

861
02:26:28,196 --> 02:26:32,360
How are we to defend Jerusalem
without knights?

862
02:26:32,534 --> 02:26:36,197
We have no knights.
Truly.

863
02:26:45,714 --> 02:26:49,206
What is your condition?
I'm servant to the patriarch.

864
02:26:49,384 --> 02:26:52,592
He's, uh, one of my servants.
Is he?

865
02:26:52,762 --> 02:26:55,128
You were born a servant.

866
02:26:56,141 --> 02:26:57,631
Kneel.

867
02:27:02,397 --> 02:27:08,518
Every man at arms or capable
of bearing them, kneel!

868
02:27:13,074 --> 02:27:14,735
On your knees!

869
02:27:21,249 --> 02:27:25,413
Be without fear in the face of your enemies.

870
02:27:25,587 --> 02:27:30,707
Be brave and upright
that God may love thee.

871
02:27:30,884 --> 02:27:35,628
Speak the truth,
even if it leads to your death.

872
02:27:37,015 --> 02:27:41,554
Safeguard the helpless.
That is your oath.

873
02:27:46,441 --> 02:27:49,103
And that is so you remember it.

874
02:27:49,277 --> 02:27:51,939
Rise a knight.

875
02:27:52,113 --> 02:27:54,149
Rise a knight.

876
02:28:01,790 --> 02:28:04,907
Master gravedigger.
It is you.

877
02:28:05,085 --> 02:28:09,875
Not what I was.
Nor are you. Rise a knight.

878
02:28:12,675 --> 02:28:16,839
Who do you think you are?
Will you alter the world?

879
02:28:17,013 --> 02:28:21,757
Does making a man a knight
make him a better fighter?

880
02:28:27,649 --> 02:28:29,480
Yes.

881
02:29:04,811 --> 02:29:07,097
Almaric.

882
02:29:09,357 --> 02:29:13,521
If you survive, Ibelin is yours.

883
02:29:16,239 --> 02:29:19,151
You are master of Ibelin.

884
02:29:24,372 --> 02:29:27,364
I confirm it.

885
02:29:33,548 --> 02:29:37,712
But it is a poor and dusty place.

886
02:29:50,064 --> 02:29:54,228
My lord?
No.

887
02:30:02,410 --> 02:30:04,992
When will it begin?

888
02:30:09,083 --> 02:30:11,165
Soon.

889
02:30:26,935 --> 02:30:29,017
Ballista!

890
02:30:41,616 --> 02:30:43,607
Get them to the walls.

891
02:30:46,454 --> 02:30:48,866
Bring water!

892
02:30:50,041 --> 02:30:52,828
Get the machines to the walls.

893
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:56,206
Push!

894
02:31:00,885 --> 02:31:02,625
Push!

895
02:31:19,153 --> 02:31:21,986
Why do they not fire back?

896
02:31:22,156 --> 02:31:24,772
They wait.

897
02:32:50,745 --> 02:32:54,909
That was only the first day.
There may be 100 more.

898
02:32:55,083 --> 02:32:58,575
Saladin will show no mercy.

899
02:33:02,090 --> 02:33:06,208
We must hold out.
Force him to offer terms.

900
02:33:06,386 --> 02:33:09,344
What terms?
We fight for the people.

901
02:33:09,514 --> 02:33:12,005
Their safety and freedom.

902
02:34:06,612 --> 02:34:10,321
Mercy.
No. I cannot.

903
02:34:59,874 --> 02:35:01,705
Four hundred.
400.

904
02:35:02,835 --> 02:35:04,700
Four hundred.
Fire!

905
02:35:04,879 --> 02:35:06,494
Fire!

906
02:35:34,909 --> 02:35:36,900
Three hundred.
Three hundred.

907
02:35:37,078 --> 02:35:39,114
Fire!

908
02:35:50,091 --> 02:35:52,252
One-fifty.
One-fifty.

909
02:35:54,262 --> 02:35:55,923
Fire!

910
02:36:27,295 --> 02:36:30,458
Hold your fire!

911
02:36:30,631 --> 02:36:31,916
Hold!

912
02:36:38,931 --> 02:36:40,796
Fire!

913
02:37:20,014 --> 02:37:22,972
Oil! Now!

914
02:37:26,020 --> 02:37:27,510
Fire!

915
02:37:46,791 --> 02:37:52,002
Who defends?
Balian of Ibelin, the son of Godfrey.

916
02:37:52,171 --> 02:37:56,835
Godfrey? Godfrey nearly
killed me in the Lebanon.

917
02:37:57,009 --> 02:38:02,470
Truly, I did not know he had a son.
It was his son at Kerak.

918
02:38:06,852 --> 02:38:09,764
The one you let live?
Yes.

919
02:38:09,939 --> 02:38:16,060
Perhaps you should not have.
Perhaps I should've had a different teacher.

920
02:40:35,334 --> 02:40:37,040
Fire!

921
02:41:50,701 --> 02:41:53,659
You are not a sister.

922
02:41:53,829 --> 02:41:56,616
We are what we do.

923
02:41:56,790 --> 02:42:01,124
And I'm a man who's traveled
a long way to die for nothing.

924
02:42:01,295 --> 02:42:03,502
What would you say to that?

925
02:42:08,594 --> 02:42:12,883
I-- I would say that I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry for you...

926
02:42:15,142 --> 02:42:18,259
...Queen of Jerusalem.

927
02:43:07,361 --> 02:43:13,152
When a body is burnt,
it cannot be resurrected until Judgment Day.

928
02:43:13,325 --> 02:43:19,195
If we do not burn these bodies,
we will all be dead of disease in three days.

929
02:43:19,373 --> 02:43:22,536
God will understand, my lord.

930
02:43:22,710 --> 02:43:25,247
And if he doesn't...

931
02:43:25,421 --> 02:43:30,085
...then he is not God,
and we need not worry.

932
02:43:45,858 --> 02:43:49,066
The wall where the Christopher Gate
used to be has been weakened.

933
02:43:49,236 --> 02:43:52,399
Yes, usually when a gate is blocked in,
it is weaker than the wall around it.

934
02:43:52,573 --> 02:43:56,407
Or stronger.
It is weaker. Rashid has seen it.

935
02:43:56,577 --> 02:44:00,991
This will be our door into Jerusalem.

936
02:44:11,342 --> 02:44:16,006
This is where we will make our stand.
We must prepare.

937
02:44:19,099 --> 02:44:21,932
Brothers! Brothers!

938
02:44:22,102 --> 02:44:26,937
God has sent you this day.
You will take no prisoners.

939
02:44:27,107 --> 02:44:30,315
As they did, so shall it be done.

940
02:45:10,901 --> 02:45:13,938
When this wall comes down...

941
02:45:15,781 --> 02:45:18,318
...there will be no quarter.

942
02:45:19,118 --> 02:45:23,953
If you throw down your arms,
your families will die.

943
02:45:28,460 --> 02:45:32,328
We can break this army here.

944
02:45:35,134 --> 02:45:38,342
So I say let them come.

945
02:45:38,512 --> 02:45:41,299
Let them come!

946
02:45:41,473 --> 02:45:45,842
Come on! Come on! Come on!

947
02:49:23,028 --> 02:49:28,068
Remember me in France,
master gravedigger.

948
02:49:28,408 --> 02:49:29,944
My lord!

949
02:50:02,943 --> 02:50:07,858
They will ask for terms.
They must ask for terms.

950
02:50:08,365 --> 02:50:11,949
Convert to Islam.
Repent later.

951
02:50:14,037 --> 02:50:17,871
You've taught me a lot
about religion, Your Eminence.

952
02:50:39,896 --> 02:50:42,888
Will you yield the city?

953
02:50:46,570 --> 02:50:50,313
Before I lose it, I will burn it to the ground.

954
02:50:50,574 --> 02:50:56,114
Your holy places, ours. Every last thing
in Jerusalem that drives men mad.

955
02:50:57,664 --> 02:51:01,327
I wonder if it would not be better if you did.

956
02:51:01,501 --> 02:51:04,334
You will destroy it?
Every stone.

957
02:51:04,504 --> 02:51:08,338
Every Christian knight you kill
will take ten Saracens with him.

958
02:51:08,508 --> 02:51:11,124
You will destroy your army here
and never raise another.

959
02:51:11,303 --> 02:51:15,797
I swear to God that to take this city
will be the end of you.

960
02:51:20,270 --> 02:51:24,013
Your city is full of women and children.

961
02:51:24,191 --> 02:51:28,355
If my army will die, so will your city.

962
02:51:32,783 --> 02:51:35,445
Do you offer terms? I ask none.

963
02:51:39,706 --> 02:51:46,168
I will give every soul safe conduct
to Christian lands. Every soul.

964
02:51:46,338 --> 02:51:49,205
The women, the children, the Old.

965
02:51:49,424 --> 02:51:54,214
And all your knights
and soldiers and your queen.

966
02:51:54,387 --> 02:51:59,723
Your king, such as he is, I leave to you...

967
02:51:59,976 --> 02:52:02,342
...and what God will make of him.

968
02:52:02,521 --> 02:52:06,730
No one will be harmed.
I swear to God.

969
02:52:06,900 --> 02:52:11,234
The Christians butchered every Muslim
within the walls when they took this city.

970
02:52:11,404 --> 02:52:14,237
I am not those men.

971
02:52:14,407 --> 02:52:16,614
I am Saladin.

972
02:52:16,785 --> 02:52:18,867
Saladin.

973
02:52:30,257 --> 02:52:34,421
Then, under these terms,
I surrender Jerusalem.

974
02:52:37,681 --> 02:52:40,423
And peace be with you.

975
02:52:44,771 --> 02:52:47,228
What is Jerusalem worth?

976
02:52:48,775 --> 02:52:50,640
Nothing.

977
02:52:56,449 --> 02:52:59,156
Everything.

978
02:53:39,117 --> 02:53:42,109
I have surrendered Jerusalem.

979
02:53:43,330 --> 02:53:47,118
All will be safely escorted to the sea.

980
02:53:48,793 --> 02:53:52,911
If this is the kingdom of Heaven...

981
02:53:54,257 --> 02:53:57,795
...let God do with it as He wills.

982
02:54:32,003 --> 02:54:35,871
Your brother's kingdom was here and here.

983
02:54:37,467 --> 02:54:41,005
That kingdom can never be surrendered.

984
02:54:47,185 --> 02:54:49,551
What should I do?

985
02:54:52,190 --> 02:54:56,229
I'm still the queen of
Acre, Ashkelon, Tripoli.

986
02:54:57,153 --> 02:55:02,364
Decide not to be a queen,
and I will come to you.

987
02:55:31,938 --> 02:55:36,523
The perfect knight.
Is that what you think you are, is it?

988
02:55:51,458 --> 02:55:54,120
We are all of us what we do.

989
02:57:04,322 --> 02:57:06,813
Do it.

990
02:57:10,703 --> 02:57:15,697
When you rise again, if you rise...

991
02:57:17,210 --> 02:57:19,496
...rise a knight.

992
02:58:32,452 --> 02:58:34,363
This horse....

993
02:58:43,796 --> 02:58:45,878
Thank you.

994
02:58:49,052 --> 02:58:51,464
And if God does not love you...

995
02:58:51,638 --> 02:58:55,881
...how could you have done
all the things that you have done?

996
02:58:56,059 --> 02:58:58,300
Peace be upon you.

997
03:01:13,071 --> 03:01:15,778
A queen never walks.

998
03:01:21,954 --> 03:01:24,286
And yet you are walking.

999
03:02:43,703 --> 03:02:45,739
Forward!

1000
03:02:47,457 --> 03:02:49,539
Forward!

1001
03:02:52,295 --> 03:02:53,330
Halt!

1002
03:02:58,843 --> 03:03:01,550
We crusade to recover
the kingdom of Jerusalem.

1003
03:03:06,350 --> 03:03:09,387
You go to where the men speak Italian.

1004
03:03:09,562 --> 03:03:13,396
And then continue
until they speak something else.

1005
03:03:21,199 --> 03:03:26,319
We come by this road to find Balian,
who was defender of Jerusalem.

1006
03:03:27,330 --> 03:03:29,571
I am the blacksmith.

1007
03:03:31,918 --> 03:03:34,910
And I am the king of England.

1008
03:03:35,087 --> 03:03:37,499
I am the blacksmith.
