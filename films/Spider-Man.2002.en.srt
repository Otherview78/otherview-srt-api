1
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:11,339
Who am l?
You sure you wanna know?

2
00:03:11,547 --> 00:03:14,801
The story of mr life
is not for the faint of heart.

3
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:17,595
lf somebody said
it was a happy little tale . . .

4
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:22,266
. . .if somebody told you I was just your
average guy , not a care in the world. . .

5
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:24,227
. . .somebody lied.

6
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:28,689
But let me assure you, this,
like any story worth telling. . .

7
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:30,274
. . .is all about a girl.

8
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,613
That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.

9
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,866
The woman l've loved
since before l even liked girls.

10
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:41,702
l'd like to tell rou that's me
next to her.

11
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:43,871
Aw, heck, l'd even take him.

12
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:47,792
Hey! Stop the bus!

13
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:49,961
That's me .

14
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:52,046
Tell him to stop! Please!

15
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:53,464
Stop!

16
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:55,883
Hey! Stop the bus!

17
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,136
Stop! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Boulevard.

18
00:03:59,303 --> 00:04:00,555
Catch a cab, Parker!

19
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:07,812
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

20
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:14,527
What a geek!

21
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:19,407
-Don't even think about it.
-You're so lame, Parker.

22
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:21,158
Would you date him?

23
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:41,262
Midtown High seniors.

24
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:45,141
No wandering. Proceed direct--
Knock it off.

25
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:48,895
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.

26
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,523
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.

27
00:04:52,732 --> 00:04:54,942
So behave accordingly .

28
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:58,154
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

29
00:04:58,362 --> 00:04:59,989
Come on, people, stay together.

30
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:03,075
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

31
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:07,288
-Where were you?
-Checking out the library .

32
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,999
-Looking at the books.
-Yeah, right.

33
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:14,128
Charles, can we drive
around the corner, please?

34
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:15,588
Why?

35
00:05:15,796 --> 00:05:17,590
The entrance is right there.

36
00:05:17,757 --> 00:05:21,469
Dad, these are public-school kids.
I'm not showing up in the Rolls.

37
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:23,971
What, you want me
to trade in my car for a Jetta. . .

38
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:27,141
. . .because you flunked out
of every private school l sent you to?

39
00:05:27,308 --> 00:05:30,311
-lt wasn't for me.
-Of course it was.

40
00:05:30,811 --> 00:05:32,647
Don't ever be ashamed
of who you are.

41
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:35,316
I'm not ashamed of who I am.

42
00:05:35,524 --> 00:05:36,817
It's just. . . .

43
00:05:36,984 --> 00:05:38,444
Just what, Harry?

44
00:05:38,653 --> 00:05:40,154
Forget it.

45
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:44,492
Pete!

46
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,577
-Hi, Harry .
-Hey, man. What's up?

47
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:48,120
Harry .

48
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:50,498
-Won't you be needing this?
-Thanks, Dad.

49
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:53,834
Peter, may l introduce my father,
Norman Osborn.

50
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:55,419
I've heard so much about you.

51
00:05:55,586 --> 00:05:59,090
-Great honour to meet you, sir.
-Harry says you're a science whiz.

52
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,176
You know,
I'm something of a scientist myself.

53
00:06:02,343 --> 00:06:05,513
I read all your research
on nanotechnology. Really brilliant.

54
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,724
-And you understood it?
-Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

55
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:12,186
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

56
00:06:12,353 --> 00:06:14,188
I live with my aunt and uncle.
They are.

57
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:16,941
Hey, you two! Let's move!

58
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:20,778
-Nice to meet you.
-Hope to see you again.

59
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:26,617
-He doesn't seem so bad.
-Not if you're a genius.

60
00:06:26,784 --> 00:06:28,744
I think he wants to adopt you.

61
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:33,624
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

62
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:37,628
They're in the order Araneae,
divided into three suborders.

63
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:38,921
That's amazing!

64
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:43,009
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.

65
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:45,386
It's unreal.

66
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:48,347
Arachnids from all three
groups possess. . .

67
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:51,809
. . .varying strengths to help them
search for food.

68
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:56,480
For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae . . .

69
00:06:56,647 --> 00:07:00,818
. . .has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.

70
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:02,737
For the school paper?

71
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:12,246
Next, we have the net web spider,
family Filistatidae . . .

72
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:14,331
...genus Kukulcania.

73
00:07:14,582 --> 00:07:18,919
Spins a funnel-shaped web whose
strands have a tensile strength. . .

74
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:24,383
. . .proportionately equal to the
high-tension wires used in bridges.

75
00:07:24,842 --> 00:07:26,510
-Leave him alone.
-Or what?

76
00:07:26,677 --> 00:07:29,680
Or his father will fire your father.

77
00:07:30,097 --> 00:07:32,433
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?

78
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,102
What is going on?

79
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:38,355
The next person who talks
will fail this course. l kid you not.

80
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:40,566
-This spider. . .
-Let's go.

81
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:44,904
. . .hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast. . .

82
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:48,616
. . .that some researchers believe
it borders on precognition.

83
00:07:48,783 --> 00:07:50,951
-An early awareness of danger.
-Jerks.

84
00:07:51,118 --> 00:07:52,912
A spider-sense.

85
00:07:53,537 --> 00:07:55,206
Hey, look at that spider.

86
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:59,794
Some spiders change colours
to blend into their environment.

87
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:01,962
It's a defence mechanism.

88
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:05,424
Peter, what makes you think
I would want to know that?

89
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:06,801
Who wouldn't?

90
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:10,805
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's genetic research facility. . . .

91
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:15,351
-You gonna talk to her now?
-Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

92
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:17,478
Armed with these DNA blueprints. . .

93
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:20,314
. . .we have now begun
what was once thought impossible.

94
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:24,193
-Disgusting.
-Yeah, hateful little things.

95
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:25,778
I love them!

96
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,988
Yeah, me too.

97
00:08:28,948 --> 00:08:32,827
You know, spiders can change
their colour. . .

98
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:36,831
-. . .to blend into their environment.
-Really?

99
00:08:36,997 --> 00:08:41,210
-Yeah, it's a defence mechanism.
-Cool.

100
00:08:41,377 --> 00:08:44,713
--transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome. . .

101
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,008
. . .combining the genetic
information from all three spiders. . .

102
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:52,847
. . .into these 1 5 genetically
designed super-spiders.

103
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:54,515
There's 1 4.

104
00:08:54,974 --> 00:08:56,350
I beg your pardon?

105
00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:59,061
-One's missing.
-Yeah.

106
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:04,608
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

107
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:08,445
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope. . .

108
00:09:08,612 --> 00:09:09,864
. . .on the Eastern Seaboard?

109
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:14,076
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

110
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:15,995
Let's go talk about how we listen.

111
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:24,170
Now" l don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools. . .

112
00:09:24,378 --> 00:09:26,255
. . .but at Midtown High. . . .

113
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:38,475
Could l take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

114
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:40,227
-Sure.
-Great.

115
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:42,605
Where do you want me?
Over here?

116
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:44,148
Yeah, that's great.

117
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:46,233
Don't make me look ugly.

118
00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:48,444
That's impossibIe.

119
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:56,952
Perfect.

120
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,253
-ls that good?
-Great.

121
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,177
That's great.

122
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:20,768
M.J . , let's go!

123
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:24,897
Wait. Thanks!

124
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:41,121
Parker, Iet's do it.

125
00:10:57,846 --> 00:11:01,308
We solved the horizon glide
and the multi-G balance issues.

126
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:04,019
I've already seen the glider.

127
00:11:04,436 --> 00:11:06,480
That's not what l'm here for.

128
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:09,358
General Slocum,
good to see you again.

129
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:12,361
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

130
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:14,446
-Norman.
-Mr. Osborn.

131
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:18,158
always a pleasure to have
our board of directors visit.

132
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:21,787
I want to see the progress report
on human performance enhancers.

133
00:11:21,954 --> 00:11:26,458
We tried vapour inhalation with rats.
Their strength increased by 800%.

134
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,502
-Excellent.
-Any side effects?

135
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:29,753
In one trial, yes.

136
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,589
An aberration. All the tests since
have been successful.

137
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:36,510
In the trial that went wrong,
what were the side effects?

138
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:39,013
Violence, aggression. . .

139
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,931
. . .and insanity.

140
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:43,851
-What do you recommend?
-That was only one test.

141
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:47,938
Except for Dr. Stromm,
our entire staff certifies the product. . .

142
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:51,025
-. . .ready for human testing.
-Dr. Stromm?

143
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:56,030
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

144
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:59,700
-Back to formula?
-Dr. Osborn.

145
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:02,703
I'll be frank with you.

146
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:07,791
I never supported your programme. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

147
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,711
The general has approved
Quest Aerospace . . .

148
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:13,797
. . .to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.

149
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:17,718
-They test in two weeks.
-And if your performance enhancers. . .

150
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:22,306
. . .have not had a successful
human trial by that date. . .

151
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:26,935
. . . l'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.

152
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:30,397
Gentlemen. Ladies.

153
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:40,908
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voila! There is light.

154
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:43,243
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

155
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,248
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

156
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:51,001
I'm already on my ass, May.

157
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:55,672
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years. . .

158
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,550
. . .what else would you call it?
I am on my ass.

159
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:01,095
Hand me that dish. The green one.

160
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:04,098
The corporation is downsizing
the people. . .

161
00:13:04,556 --> 00:13:06,433
. . .and upsizing their profits.

162
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:09,603
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.

163
00:13:10,646 --> 00:13:13,524
Well. . . . Well, let's look
in the paper and see.

164
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,444
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

165
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:19,238
Computer. . . .

166
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:23,200
Computer salesman" computer
engineer, computer analyst.

167
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:27,121
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

168
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:32,709
I'm 68. l'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.

169
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:35,796
I Iove you. And Peter loves you.

170
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:39,299
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

171
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,971
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

172
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:49,393
Hi, sweetie. You're just--
Just in time for dinner.

173
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:52,146
Hey. How you doing, buddy?
How was the field trip?

174
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:55,149
I don't feel Well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

175
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:57,818
-You won't have a bite?
-No thanks. Had a bite.

176
00:13:57,985 --> 00:14:00,404
Did you get some pictures, Peter?

177
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:04,074
I gotta crash. Everything's fine .

178
00:14:05,492 --> 00:14:07,077
What's that aIl about?

179
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:30,559
ln this recombination lab . . .

180
00:14:30,726 --> 00:14:35,355
. . .we use synthesised transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome. . .

181
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:38,609
. . .combining the genetic
information from all three spiders. . .

182
00:14:38,817 --> 00:14:43,614
. . .into these 1 5 genetically
designed super-spiders.

183
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:02,049
Dr. Osborn" please. The
performance enhancers aren't ready.

184
00:15:02,216 --> 00:15:05,552
The data just doesn't justify
this test.

185
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:09,389
Now" l'm asking you for the last time .
We can't do this.

186
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:11,767
Don't be a coward.

187
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:14,811
Risks are part of laboratory science.

188
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,732
Let me reschedule, with a proper
medical staff and a volunteer.

189
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:22,402
-Just give me two weeks.
-Two weeks? ln two weeks. . .

190
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:26,073
. . .we'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP Will be dead.

191
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,992
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourseIf.

192
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,828
-Get me the Promachloraperazine.
-For what?

193
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:35,749
It begins catalyzation when the vapour
hits the bloodstream.

194
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:40,337
40 ,000 years of evolution. . .

195
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:44,258
. . .and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.

196
00:15:58,105 --> 00:15:59,439
Oh, that's coId.

197
00:16:58,165 --> 00:16:59,166
Norman?

198
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,963
Norman!

199
00:17:06,131 --> 00:17:07,507
Norman!

200
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:17,017
Oh, my God.

201
00:17:18,518 --> 00:17:21,647
Oh, my God! Norman?

202
00:17:22,314 --> 00:17:24,441
Oh, my God! Norman!

203
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:42,042
Back to formula?

204
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:18,578
Weird.

205
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:30,882
-Peter?
-Yeah?

206
00:18:31,091 --> 00:18:32,843
Are you aIl right?

207
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:36,388
I'm fine.

208
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,807
Any better this morning?
Any change?

209
00:18:38,974 --> 00:18:40,350
Change?

210
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:43,270
Yep. Big change.

211
00:18:43,437 --> 00:18:47,441
-Well" hurry up. You'll be late.
-Right.

212
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:07,210
Okay.

213
00:19:11,256 --> 00:19:15,719
-Goodness me!
-Jeez. l thought you were sick.

214
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:17,596
-l got better.
-You see?

215
00:19:17,763 --> 00:19:21,141
-Bye, guys.
-Have you got your lunch money?

216
00:19:21,308 --> 00:19:24,978
Hey, Michelangelo, don't forget,
we're painting the kitchen after school.

217
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:27,939
Sure thing, uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

218
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:30,233
And don't start up with me.

219
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:35,489
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

220
00:19:36,448 --> 00:19:40,160
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!

221
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:43,914
-l have to go to school.
-Who's stopping you?

222
00:20:01,306 --> 00:20:02,974
Hi, M.J .

223
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,352
Hey, M.J .

224
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:10,148
I don't know if you realise this, but
we've been neighbours since l was 6.

225
00:20:10,315 --> 00:20:13,652
And l was wondering
if we could get together sometime?

226
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,403
I got the car. Hop in.

227
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,198
Do something fun?
Or, l don't know.

228
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:21,117
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

229
00:20:22,494 --> 00:20:23,745
Or not.

230
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:31,920
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!

231
00:20:33,296 --> 00:20:36,007
-Stop the bus!
-Catch a cab!

232
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:38,051
Tell him to stop.

233
00:20:38,718 --> 00:20:40,720
-Check him out!
-Dork!

234
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:04,452
Dad!

235
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:06,788
Dad, are you All right?

236
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:08,915
Harry .

237
00:21:12,252 --> 00:21:14,254
What are you doing on the floor?

238
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:15,755
I don't know.

239
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,925
Have you been there all night?

240
00:21:20,927 --> 00:21:22,178
Last night l was--

241
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:25,765

00:21:27,017 --> 00:21:28,768
-l don't remember.
-Mr. Osborn?

243
00:21:28,935 --> 00:21:31,313
Sir, l asked her to wait in the foyer.

244
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:35,859
-My father's not feeling Well.
-Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

245
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:37,027
What?

246
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:40,780
They found his body in the lab.
He's been murdered, sir.

247
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:44,242
-What are you talking about?
-And the flight suit and the glider. . . .

248
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:46,494
-What about it?
-lt's been stoIen, sir.

249
00:22:11,436 --> 00:22:14,189
Wow! Great reflexes!

-Thanks.
-No problem.

251
00:22:18,318 --> 00:22:22,238
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.

252
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:24,658
You just get contacts?

253
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:33,583

You are drunk, do you know that?

282
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:40,992
Where's she going?
Where you going?

283
00:28:42,076 --> 00:28:45,413
These dishes are not done.
Somebody's gotta do the dishes.

284
00:28:45,621 --> 00:28:48,916
-Why don't you do them?
-Get in here and do the dishes.

Well, l heard" but l was
just taking out the trash.

288

I guess you can always hear us.

289
00:29:02,638 --> 00:29:04,932
Everybody shouts.

290
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:06,392
Your aunt and uncle don't.

291
00:29:07,226 --> 00:29:10,355
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

292
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:15,943
Listen, M.J . , about today

I'm sorry. ls he okay?

295
00:29:20,573 --> 00:29:24,535
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

296
00:29:27,622 --> 00:29:30,833
So where are you going
after you graduate?

297
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:37,882
I wanna move into the city.

298
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,596
And hopefully get a job
as a photographer.

299
00:29:43,763 --> 00:29:46,599
Work my way through college.

300
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,935
What about you?

301
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:51,104
Headed for the city too.

302
00:29:51,813 --> 00:29:54,065
Can't wait to get out of here.

303
00:29:55,233 --> 00:29:56,734

Really?

310
00:30:14,836 --> 00:30:17,004
Oh, that's perfect.

311
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:19,841
You were awesome

00:30:20,174 --> 00:30:22,009
-ReaIly?
-Yeah.

313
00:30:22,677 --> 00:30:25,680
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

314
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:28,349
Peter, that was first grade.

315
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,351

00:30:38,985 --> 00:30:42,572
You can just see what's coming.

320
00:30:45,658 --> 00:30:48,411
What do you see coming for you?

321
00:30:50,997 --> 00:30:52,665
I don't know.

322
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:59,672
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.

323
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:06,179
And what for me?

324
00:31:06,345 --> 00:31:07,680
For you?

325
00:31:09,098 --> 00:31:11,851
You're gonna light up Broadway.

I hunch.

329
00:31:25,656 --> 00:31:27,158
Don't.

334
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:44,383
-Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!

Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

339
00:31:57,063 --> 00:31:58,564
Cool car.

340
00:33:31,282 --> 00:33:33,326
What's going on in there?

341
00:33:33,534 --> 00:33:36,162
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May .

342
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:39,999
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.

343
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:42,376
Okay. Thanks.

344
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,535
Something's bothering him. Maybe
he's too embarrassed to tell me.

345
00:34:16,702 --> 00:34:19,372
Maybe I'm too embarrassed
to ask him.

346
00:34:20,164 --> 00:34:22,208
I just don't know anymore.

347
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,960
I'm going to the Iibrary .
I'll see you later.

348
00:34:25,127 --> 00:34:28,756
-Wait, Pete. l'll drive you there" buddy.

-Thanks for the ride, uncle Ben.

-We can talk later.
-Well" we can talk now. lf you let me .

352
00:34:52,113 --> 00:34:54,323
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

353
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,367
Because we haven't talked
for so long. . .

354
00:34:56,534 --> 00:34:58,536
. . .May and l
don't know who you are anymore.

355
00:34:58,703 --> 00:35:03,749
You shirk your chores. You have All
those weird experiments in your room.

356
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:08,045
-You start fights at school--
-l didn't start that fight, l told you that.

357
00:35:08,254 --> 00:35:11,215
-You sure as hell finished it.
-Was l supposed to run away?

358
00:35:11,424 --> 00:35:14,427
No, you're not supposed
to run away " but. . . .

359
00:35:14,593 --> 00:35:19,140
Pete, you're changing. I went through
exactly the same thing at your age.

360
00:35:19,348 --> 00:35:20,891
No. Not exactly.

361
00:35:21,058 --> 00:35:22,184
Peter. . .

362
00:35:22,727 --> 00:35:25,438
. . .these are the years
when a man changes. . .

363
00:35:25,604 --> 00:35:29,608
. . .into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life .

364
00:35:29,775 --> 00:35:32,069
Just be careful
who you change into.

365
00:35:34,405 --> 00:35:38,909
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.

366
00:35:39,452 --> 00:35:42,163
But just because you can
beat him up. . .

367
00:35:42,621 --> 00:35:44,874
. . .doesn't give you the right to.

368
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:50,796
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

369
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:56,385
Are you afraid l'll become a criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?

370
00:35:56,552 --> 00:35:59,972
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing me.

371
00:36:00,264 --> 00:36:04,477
I don't mean to lecture or preach.
And l know l'm not your father--

372
00:36:04,643 --> 00:36:07,480
Then stop pretending to be!

373
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:12,818

What's the hell's the matter with you?
You let him go!

00:42:44,376 --> 00:42:46,587
Cut him off in the lobby

453
00:42:46,753 --> 00:42:50,799
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away with my money.

454
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:53,218
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

-What happened?
-Carjacker. He's been shot.

462

We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

463
00:43:42,267 --> 00:43:43,644
Uncle Ben?

464
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:46,063

They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.

470
00:44:31,024 --> 00:44:35,737
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

471
00:47:12,853 --> 00:47:14,855
Get a unit to the rear!

472

I got the back!

473
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:33,665
Who's there?

Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!

475
00:48:03,195 --> 00:48:07,699
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

00:48:07,866 --> 00:48:09,367
Answer me!

Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.

481
00:49:39,874 --> 00:49:42,460
Oh, no. My God.

482
00:49:44,421 --> 00:49:48,133
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!

483

-Good evening.
-General. Good to see you.

484
00:50:00,228 --> 00:50:03,106
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, general.

485
00:50:03,273 --> 00:50:08,445
Well, if it does what you say it can,

Absolutely.
Captain Curtis is our top pilot.

488
00:50:16,161 --> 00:50:18,913
Now" what about your commitment
to OSCORP?

489
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:23,001
Nothing would please me more than to
put Norman Osborn out of business.

490
00:50:25,337 --> 00:50:28,381
Preflight complete. Mark.

491
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:35,138
We are picking up
an unidentified object, closing fast.

492
00:50:35,305 --> 00:50:36,389

494
00:50:38,516 --> 00:50:39,893

Darling, l'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

498

Pete? Good news. Dad got the place
in New York, so we're all set this fall.

499
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,543
-That's great.
-You made it.

500
00:51:08,129 --> 00:51:11,633
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

501
00:51:13,051 --> 00:51:15,220
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, Dad.

502
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,264
Peter, the science award.

Commencement:

507
00:51:31,611 --> 00:51:35,740
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

508
00:51:37,575 --> 00:51:41,246
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.

509
00:51:42,122 --> 00:51:43,998
You know what? Whatever.

510
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:46,000
Your loss.

511
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:50,255
You're like a brother to Harry .
That makes you family.

512
00:51:50,422 --> 00:51:53,383
And if you ever need anything,
just give me a call.

513
00:52:08,148 --> 00:52:10,400
Can l fix you something?

514
00:52:10,567 --> 00:52:12,068
No, thanks.

515
00:52:56,821 --> 00:52:59,032
I missed him a lot today.

516
00:53:01,618 --> 00:53:03,119
I know.

517
00:53:04,871 --> 00:53:06,706
I miss him too.

518
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:10,794
But he was there.

519
00:53:13,963 --> 00:53:19,177
I can't help thinking about
the last thing l said to him.

520
00:53:19,469 --> 00:53:24,390
He tried to tell me something
important, and l threw it in his face .

521
00:53:26,142 --> 00:53:28,228
You loved him. . .

522
00:53:29,896 --> 00:53:32,148
. . .and he loved you.

523
00:53:33,024 --> 00:53:36,694
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

524
00:53:36,861 --> 00:53:40,323
How you were meant
for great things.

525
00:53:40,865 --> 00:53:43,201
You won't disappoint him.

526
00:54:16,734 --> 00:54:20,905
With great power
comes great responsibility.

527
00:54:21,072 --> 00:54:24,284
Remember that, Pete.
Remember that.

528
00:54:34,294 --> 00:54:35,587
Hurry up!

529
00:54:47,932 --> 00:54:51,686
He's not a man. My brother saw him
building a nest in Lincoln Center.

530
00:54:51,853 --> 00:54:55,064
I think he's human, a man.
Could be a woman.

531
00:54:59,152 --> 00:55:01,905
Bobby. Get a Ioad of this!

532
00:55:05,241 --> 00:55:07,118
He throws up his hands,
ropes come out. . .

533
00:55:07,285 --> 00:55:09,329
. . .and he climbs up them
like a spider web.

534
00:55:09,621 --> 00:55:13,750
I see the web, his signature"
and l know Spider-Man was here.

535
00:55:13,917 --> 00:55:16,544
The guy protects us,
protects the people.

536
00:55:16,711 --> 00:55:19,464
Some kind of freakyloo
or something. Wackadoo.

537
00:55:19,631 --> 00:55:21,633
He stinks and l don't like him.

538
00:55:22,383 --> 00:55:23,968
Don't move, lady!

539
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,812
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

540
00:55:35,021 --> 00:55:37,148
He has those tights
and that tight little--

541
00:55:37,315 --> 00:55:40,652
Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug

542
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:44,614
But we should all just give him
One big hug

543
00:55:44,822 --> 00:55:49,410
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man

544
00:55:53,081 --> 00:55:56,834
"Who is Spider-Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

545
00:55:57,001 --> 00:56:00,880
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

546
00:56:01,089 --> 00:56:03,007
Mr. Jameson, your wife needs--

547
00:56:03,174 --> 00:56:04,592
There's a page six problem.

548
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:06,678
We have a page one problem.
Shut up.

549
00:56:06,844 --> 00:56:08,388
-Well?
-He's news.

550
00:56:08,596 --> 00:56:11,015
-The clients can't wait.
-They're about to.

551
00:56:11,182 --> 00:56:15,269
-He pulled six people off a subway.
-From a wreck he probably caused.

552
00:56:15,436 --> 00:56:17,105
Something goes wrong
and he's there.

553
00:56:17,271 --> 00:56:19,607
Look! He's fleeing the scene.
What's that tell you?

554
00:56:19,774 --> 00:56:22,527
He's not fleeing, he's probably
going to save somebody else.

555
00:56:22,694 --> 00:56:23,695
He's a hero!

556
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:26,698
Then why does he wear a mask?
What's he got to hide?

557
00:56:26,864 --> 00:56:29,826
She needs to know if you want
chintz or chenille in the dining room.

558
00:56:29,993 --> 00:56:32,537
-Whichever one's cheaper.
-Mr. Jameson, it's like this:

559
00:56:32,704 --> 00:56:34,038
We double-booked page six.

560
00:56:34,205 --> 00:56:36,541
So Macy's and Conway's both have
three quarters--

561
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:39,877
-We sold out four printings.
-Sold out?

562
00:56:40,044 --> 00:56:41,295
Every copy.

563
00:56:41,879 --> 00:56:44,382
Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one,
with a decent picture.

564
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:46,217
-Conway to page 7 .
-That's a problem.

565
00:56:46,384 --> 00:56:48,720
Page eight, give him 1 0 percent off.
Five percent.

566
00:56:48,886 --> 00:56:50,596
-That can't be done.
-Get out of here!

567
00:56:50,763 --> 00:56:52,682
We don't have a decent picture.

568
00:56:52,849 --> 00:56:55,601
Eddie's been on it for weeks,
but we can barely see him.

569
00:56:55,768 --> 00:56:57,895
Aw, what is he, shy?

570
00:56:58,062 --> 00:57:02,066
If we can get a picture of JuIia Roberts
in a thong, we can get this weirdo.

571
00:57:02,233 --> 00:57:05,653
Put an ad on the front page:
"Cash for a picture of Spider-Man."

572
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:09,282
He doesn't wanna be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

573
00:57:20,501 --> 00:57:21,586
Hey!

574
00:57:21,753 --> 00:57:23,171
Buzz off.

575
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,841
-M.J . , it's me, Peter.
-Hi!

576
00:57:28,551 --> 00:57:33,431
-What are you doing around here?
-Begging for a job. How about you?

577
00:57:33,931 --> 00:57:37,643
-l'm headed to an audition.
-An audition? So you're acting?

578
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:38,853
Yeah.

579
00:57:39,062 --> 00:57:42,940
I work steady.
In fact, l just got off a job.

580
00:57:43,107 --> 00:57:44,275
That's great.

581
00:57:44,859 --> 00:57:48,071
-You're doing it. Living your dream.
-Glamour girl!

582
00:57:48,237 --> 00:57:49,864
Your drawer was short $6!

583
00:57:50,031 --> 00:57:52,658
Next time that happens,
I'll take it out of your cheque.

584
00:57:53,743 --> 00:57:57,538
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!

585
00:57:57,747 --> 00:58:00,041
Yes, Enrique! Okay? l get you.

586
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:04,337
It better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.

587
00:58:11,302 --> 00:58:13,012
Some dream, huh?

588
00:58:13,888 --> 00:58:16,516
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

589
00:58:16,682 --> 00:58:19,477
-Don't tell Harry.
-Don't tell Harry?

590
00:58:19,894 --> 00:58:24,482
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

591
00:58:24,899 --> 00:58:26,484
Oh, yeah. Right.

592
00:58:26,734 --> 00:58:29,821
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

593
00:58:29,987 --> 00:58:34,408
-He'd think it was low or something.
-lt's not low. You have a job.

594
00:58:34,742 --> 00:58:39,080
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place l like to call Earth.

595
00:58:40,581 --> 00:58:42,500
No, l guess not.

596
00:58:47,505 --> 00:58:49,090
Thanks, Pete.

597
00:58:50,508 --> 00:58:52,426
We should catch up sometime.

598
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,183
Let's get some lunch some evening.

599
00:59:00,434 --> 00:59:04,939
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

600
00:59:05,148 --> 00:59:07,859
-And l won't tell Harry .
-No, don't teIl Harry.

601
00:59:08,025 --> 00:59:09,277
I won't.

602
00:59:11,445 --> 00:59:13,197
I won't tell Harry.

603
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,961
Timing's perfect. Hey.

604
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:30,464
Five new contracts. lt'll be great.

605
00:59:32,592 --> 00:59:35,261
Storming Norman's
making his weekly inspection.

606
00:59:36,095 --> 00:59:38,347
Spent half of it on the phone.

607
00:59:38,931 --> 00:59:43,644
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. l'm really lost here.

608
00:59:44,478 --> 00:59:45,771
Are you aIl right?

609
00:59:47,106 --> 00:59:51,652
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.

610
00:59:52,945 --> 00:59:55,865
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me .

611
00:59:56,032 --> 00:59:57,617
You were late again?

612
00:59:58,242 --> 01:00:00,995
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?

613
01:00:02,371 --> 01:00:03,623
Around.

614
01:00:03,789 --> 01:00:05,499
Peter Parker.

615
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:08,336
-Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
-Who's that?

616
01:00:08,502 --> 01:00:11,589
-This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
-Dad.

617
01:00:11,964 --> 01:00:13,633
-When do l get to meet her?
-Dad.

618
01:00:13,799 --> 01:00:17,094
Well, sorry .
Harry hasn't mentioned her.

619
01:00:19,972 --> 01:00:23,226
Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?

620
01:00:23,434 --> 01:00:26,270
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

621
01:00:26,437 --> 01:00:30,775
-No, I appreciate it" but l'll be fine.
-lt's no probIem. I'll make a few calls.

622
01:00:30,942 --> 01:00:35,238
No, l couldn't accept it, sir.
I like to earn what l get. I'll find work.

623
01:00:35,404 --> 01:00:37,073
I respect that.

624
01:00:37,782 --> 01:00:39,909
You want to make it
on your own steam.

625
01:00:40,576 --> 01:00:41,911
That's great.

626
01:00:42,787 --> 01:00:45,122
What other skills do you have,
Parker?

627
01:00:45,331 --> 01:00:47,291
I was thinking about photography .

628
01:00:50,419 --> 01:00:51,671
Hello.

629
01:00:53,589 --> 01:00:55,883
Let's go! Move it!

630
01:00:57,051 --> 01:00:58,719
Watch the street!

631
01:01:14,151 --> 01:01:15,528
Cheese!

632
01:01:24,453 --> 01:01:25,746
They're crap.

633
01:01:25,955 --> 01:01:28,916
Crap, crap. Megacrap.

634
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:32,295
-l'Il give you $200 for All of them.
-That seems a little low.

635
01:01:32,503 --> 01:01:34,255
Take them somewhere else, then.

636
01:01:34,422 --> 01:01:36,966
Your wife sars the tile for the forer
is out of stock.

637
01:01:37,133 --> 01:01:38,759
Tell her we'll put a rug there.

638
01:01:39,135 --> 01:01:41,095
Sit down. Give me that.

639
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,224
Give you 300 .
That's the standard freelance fee.

640
01:01:45,391 --> 01:01:47,727
-Tear up page one. Run that photo.
-Headline?

641
01:01:48,019 --> 01:01:51,272
"Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos."

642
01:01:51,439 --> 01:01:53,316
Menace? He was protecting
that armoured--

643
01:01:53,482 --> 01:01:54,525
Tell you what, Atticus.

644
01:01:54,692 --> 01:01:57,403
You take the pictures,
I'll make up the headlines. Okay?

645
01:01:57,570 --> 01:01:59,572
-Yes, sir.
-Goody.

646
01:02:00,031 --> 01:02:03,534
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.

647
01:02:04,035 --> 01:02:06,787
-l'd like a job, sir.
-No jobs. FreeIance.

648
01:02:06,996 --> 01:02:08,622
Best thing for a kid your age.

649
01:02:08,831 --> 01:02:13,127
You bring me more shots
of that clown, maybe l'll buy them.

650
01:02:13,336 --> 01:02:16,297
But l never said you have a job.
Meat.

651
01:02:16,464 --> 01:02:20,760
I'll send you a box of Christmas
meat. Bring me more photos.

652
01:02:22,345 --> 01:02:23,554
-Hi.
-Hi.

653
01:02:23,763 --> 01:02:27,183
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

654
01:02:28,267 --> 01:02:31,395
-welcome to the Daily Bugle .
-Thank you.

655
01:02:31,937 --> 01:02:33,314
I'm Peter Parker.

656
01:02:35,816 --> 01:02:37,985
I'm a photographer.

657
01:02:38,778 --> 01:02:41,322
Yes. l can see that.

658
01:02:49,038 --> 01:02:50,873
As of today . . .

659
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:55,044
. . .OSCORP lndustries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace . . .

660
01:02:55,294 --> 01:02:59,715
. . .as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

661
01:02:59,882 --> 01:03:02,718
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board. . .

662
01:03:02,885 --> 01:03:06,055
. . .costs are down,
revenues are up. . .

663
01:03:06,305 --> 01:03:09,141
. . .and our stock
has never been higher.

664
01:03:09,308 --> 01:03:13,729
Wonderful news, Norman.
That's why we're selling the company.

665
01:03:14,814 --> 01:03:15,815
What?

666
01:03:16,023 --> 01:03:21,195
Quest is recapitalising in the wake
of the bombing. Expanding.

667
01:03:21,404 --> 01:03:24,156
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

668
01:03:24,323 --> 01:03:25,491
Why wasn't l told?

669
01:03:25,658 --> 01:03:29,745
They don't want a power struggle
with entrenched management.

670
01:03:30,037 --> 01:03:32,331
The deal is off if you come with it.

671
01:03:32,498 --> 01:03:35,918
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

672
01:03:36,127 --> 01:03:38,087
You can't do this to me.

673
01:03:41,257 --> 01:03:43,551
I started this company.

674
01:03:44,593 --> 01:03:47,012
You know how much l sacrificed?!

675
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:56,313
-Oh, Max. Please .
-Norman, the board is unanimous.

676
01:03:56,856 --> 01:04:00,860
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

677
01:04:01,026 --> 01:04:02,528

01:10:22,407 --> 01:10:25,077
Well, beats taking the subway.

Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

01:10:28,705 --> 01:10:29,832
Wait.

Don't let the bedbugs--

728
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:33,061
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.

729
01:11:34,771 --> 01:11:38,400
Look, Pete, l should have
told you about us.

730
01:11:39,776 --> 01:11:42,404
But you shouId know
I'm crazy about her.

731
01:11:42,571 --> 01:11:45,616
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.

732
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,201
You're right.

733
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:50,621
I didn't.

734
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:57,044
I'm gonna get some rest.

735
01:11:58,295 --> 01:12:00,547
I'm gonna stay up for a whiIe.

736
01:12:01,632 --> 01:12:03,383
What was that thing?

737
01:12:03,967 --> 01:12:05,385
I don't know.

738
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:10,098
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

739
01:12:25,989 --> 01:12:27,658
Somebody there?

740
01:12:27,908 --> 01:12:29,952
Somebodr.

741
01:12:31,286 --> 01:12:32,829
Who said that?

742
01:12:33,497 --> 01:12:36,833
Don`t play the innocent with me .

743
01:12:39,294 --> 01:12:41,964
You've known all along.

744
01:12:45,968 --> 01:12:47,344
Where are you?

745
01:12:47,511 --> 01:12:51,640
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine .

746
01:12:58,438 --> 01:13:00,273
l`m right here.

747
01:13:02,025 --> 01:13:04,027
I don't understand.

748
01:13:05,028 --> 01:13:08,198
Did you think it was coincidence?

749
01:13:08,448 --> 01:13:11,994
So many good things,
all happening for you.

750
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:15,831
All for you. Norman.

751
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:19,793
What do you want?

752
01:13:20,335 --> 01:13:22,379
To say what you won't.

753
01:13:22,671 --> 01:13:25,215
To do what you can't.

754
01:13:25,382 --> 01:13:29,970
To remove those in your way.

755
01:13:33,932 --> 01:13:35,892
The board members.

756
01:13:37,185 --> 01:13:38,562
You killed them.

757
01:13:38,729 --> 01:13:40,355
We killed them.

758
01:13:40,689 --> 01:13:41,690
We?

759
01:13:41,857 --> 01:13:43,400
Remember?

760
01:13:43,567 --> 01:13:46,236
Your little accident
in the laboratory.

761
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:49,865
The performance enhancers.

762
01:13:50,032 --> 01:13:55,078
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.

763
01:13:55,579 --> 01:13:59,374
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:

764
01:13:59,541 --> 01:14:02,419
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

765
01:14:02,586 --> 01:14:05,088
And it's only the beginning.

766
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:10,927
There's only one who can stop us.

767
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:15,223
Or imagine if he joined us.

768
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:23,106
Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.

769
01:14:23,273 --> 01:14:26,610
The Green GobIin. You like that?
Made it up myself.

770
01:14:26,777 --> 01:14:28,403
These weirdos
all gotta have a name.

771
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:29,780
Mr. Jameson, Spider--

772
01:14:29,946 --> 01:14:31,615
-Hoffman!
-Yeah?

773
01:14:32,824 --> 01:14:36,536
Copyright the name "Green Goblin."
I want a quarter every time it's said.

774
01:14:36,703 --> 01:14:37,871
How about "Green Meanie"?

775
01:14:39,247 --> 01:14:42,125
Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.
That's slander.

776
01:14:42,292 --> 01:14:44,628
It is not. l resent that.

777
01:14:44,878 --> 01:14:47,631
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's Iibel.

778
01:14:47,839 --> 01:14:49,466
You don't trust anybody .

779
01:14:49,925 --> 01:14:51,676
I trust my barber.

780
01:14:52,427 --> 01:14:54,054
What are you, his lawyer? Get out.

781
01:14:54,221 --> 01:14:56,348
Let him sue me,
get rich like a normal person.

782
01:14:56,515 --> 01:14:58,266
That's what made this country--

783
01:15:06,483 --> 01:15:09,611
Jameson, you slime.

784
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:13,115
Who's the photographer
who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?

785
01:15:13,323 --> 01:15:15,158
I don't know.
His stuff comes by mail.

786
01:15:15,325 --> 01:15:17,244
-You're lying!
-l swear.

787
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:19,412
He's the one
who can bring me to him.

788
01:15:19,579 --> 01:15:22,499
-l don't know who he is.
-You are useless.

789
01:15:22,707 --> 01:15:24,960
Set him down, tough guy.

790
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:29,214
-Speak of the devil.
-l knew you two were in this together!

791
01:15:29,673 --> 01:15:32,592
Hey, kiddo" let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute" Will you?

792
01:15:32,801 --> 01:15:35,262
SIeep. . . .

793
01:15:49,734 --> 01:15:53,738
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

794
01:15:53,905 --> 01:15:58,326
No, you're not dead yet.

795
01:15:58,535 --> 01:16:00,704
Just paralysed. . .

796
01:16:00,871 --> 01:16:02,831
. . .temporarily.

797
01:16:03,832 --> 01:16:06,918
You're an amazing creature,
Spider-Man.

798
01:16:07,127 --> 01:16:09,796
You and I are not so different.

799
01:16:10,505 --> 01:16:13,842
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

800
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:16,928
Well, to each his own.

801
01:16:17,095 --> 01:16:20,056
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

802
01:16:20,724 --> 01:16:25,353
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.

803
01:16:25,562 --> 01:16:28,815
But the one thing they love
more than a hero. . .

804
01:16:29,024 --> 01:16:32,611
. . .is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

805
01:16:32,777 --> 01:16:37,407
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventuaIly, they Will hate you.

806
01:16:37,574 --> 01:16:38,575
Why bother?

807
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:43,496
-Because it's right.
-Here's the real truth.

808
01:16:43,914 --> 01:16:46,917
There are eight miIlion peopIe
in this city.

809
01:16:47,125 --> 01:16:51,421
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose. . .

810
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:55,592
. . .of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

811
01:16:55,759 --> 01:16:57,177
You, me. . .

812
01:16:57,761 --> 01:16:59,679
. . .we're exceptional.

813
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:04,601
I could squash you like a bug
right now.

814
01:17:04,809 --> 01:17:08,438
But l'm offering you a choice.
Join me.

815
01:17:08,647 --> 01:17:12,234
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

816
01:17:12,442 --> 01:17:15,195
What we could create.

817
01:17:15,779 --> 01:17:17,781
Or we could destroy .

818
01:17:17,948 --> 01:17:21,910
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle. . .

819
01:17:22,118 --> 01:17:24,537
. . .again and again and again until
we're both dead.

820
01:17:24,704 --> 01:17:26,998
Is that what you want?

821
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,878
Think about it, hero.

822
01:17:43,848 --> 01:17:49,187
ln spite of everything rou've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

823
01:17:58,321 --> 01:17:59,322
Hey!

824
01:17:59,489 --> 01:18:00,991
-lt's me again.
-Hey!

825
01:18:01,366 --> 01:18:02,784
How was your audition?

826
01:18:02,993 --> 01:18:05,996
-How'd you know?
-The hot line. Your mom. . .

827
01:18:06,162 --> 01:18:08,123
. . .toId my aunt, told me.

828
01:18:08,581 --> 01:18:09,916
So you just came by?

829
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:13,753
I was in the neighbourhood.
Needed to see a friendly face .

830
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,632
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighbourhood, but. . . .

831
01:18:18,758 --> 01:18:20,260
So how'd it go?

832
01:18:22,429 --> 01:18:25,015
They said I needed acting lessons.

833
01:18:25,181 --> 01:18:28,935
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

834
01:18:29,102 --> 01:18:34,441
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7 .84 .

835
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,861
I'd like a cheeseburger.

836
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:41,781
Oh, but l'm going out to dinner
with Harry.

837
01:18:42,198 --> 01:18:43,616
Come with us.

838
01:18:43,783 --> 01:18:46,536
No, thanks. How's it going with. . .?

839
01:18:48,455 --> 01:18:50,957
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

840
01:18:51,458 --> 01:18:52,959
It's not?

841
01:18:54,377 --> 01:18:56,046
Why so interested?

842
01:18:56,713 --> 01:18:58,214
I'm not.

843
01:18:58,465 --> 01:18:59,841
You're not?

844
01:19:01,468 --> 01:19:04,220
-Well" why would l be?
-l don't know.

845
01:19:04,471 --> 01:19:06,264
Why wouId you be?

846
01:19:08,141 --> 01:19:10,477
I , that's a--

847
01:19:10,685 --> 01:19:12,187
I don't know.

848
01:19:14,397 --> 01:19:17,233
Sorry you won't come with us.

849
01:19:19,694 --> 01:19:21,654
I better run, tiger.

850
01:19:30,372 --> 01:19:32,374
Hey, check it out, man.

851
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:34,209
Come on, man.

852
01:19:37,754 --> 01:19:41,007
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

853
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,360
Get off me!

854
01:20:33,643 --> 01:20:35,145
Wait!

855
01:20:39,983 --> 01:20:42,360
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.

856
01:20:42,527 --> 01:20:46,906
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think l have a superhero stalker.

857
01:20:47,115 --> 01:20:48,992
I was in the neighbourhood.

858
01:20:50,869 --> 01:20:53,496
You are amazing.

859
01:20:54,456 --> 01:20:57,167
Some people don't think so.

860
01:20:58,251 --> 01:21:01,254
-But you are.
-Nice to have a fan.

861
01:21:02,005 --> 01:21:05,216
Do I get to say thank you this time?

862
01:21:06,092 --> 01:21:07,594
Wait.

863
01:22:16,579 --> 01:22:18,748
Let me in! My baby's in there!

864
01:22:18,915 --> 01:22:21,000
-Let me go!
-The roof's collapsing!

865
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:24,671
-Somebody save my baby!
-The roof's about to collapse!

866
01:22:24,879 --> 01:22:26,214
Look! Up there!

867
01:22:32,887 --> 01:22:34,681
Save my baby, please!

868
01:22:58,371 --> 01:22:59,539
No!

869
01:23:07,255 --> 01:23:11,259
-lt's okay. Your baby's fine.
-Oh, my baby!

870
01:23:12,302 --> 01:23:15,221
God bless you, Spider-Man.
Bless you.

871
01:23:15,471 --> 01:23:17,181
Don't Iet him get away!

872
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:20,643
Hold it! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.

873
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:23,062
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!

874
01:23:25,315 --> 01:23:26,316
I'm going.

875
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:31,654
-l'll be here when you get back.
-Not coming back, chief.

876
01:23:32,071 --> 01:23:33,197
Go! Go!

877
01:23:42,123 --> 01:23:43,833
Where are you?

878
01:23:45,877 --> 01:23:47,462
Where are you?

879
01:23:52,842 --> 01:23:55,219
I'm gonna get you out of here!

880
01:23:57,805 --> 01:23:59,307
It's okay.

881
01:24:06,356 --> 01:24:08,941
You're pathetically predictable.

882
01:24:09,108 --> 01:24:11,027
Like a moth to the fIame.

883
01:24:11,903 --> 01:24:14,364
What about my generous proposal?

884
01:24:15,406 --> 01:24:18,242
Are you in or are you out?

885
01:24:18,451 --> 01:24:21,037
It's you who's out, Gobby.
Out of your mind.

886
01:24:21,329 --> 01:24:23,456
Wrong answer.

887
01:24:24,791 --> 01:24:26,292
Oh, great.

888
01:25:04,956 --> 01:25:07,750
No one says no to me!

889
01:25:15,091 --> 01:25:18,511
-M.J . , will you stop goofing around?
-Harry, relax.

890
01:25:21,013 --> 01:25:22,265
He's here.

891
01:25:23,057 --> 01:25:25,685
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

892
01:25:26,394 --> 01:25:29,063
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.

893
01:25:29,272 --> 01:25:32,358
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.

894
01:25:32,567 --> 01:25:35,903
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.

895
01:25:36,237 --> 01:25:38,948
Who is this lovely young lady?

896
01:25:39,115 --> 01:25:43,411
I'd like you to meet my father.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

897
01:25:43,619 --> 01:25:46,289
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

898
01:25:46,497 --> 01:25:50,209
-Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
-Now, where is Peter?

899
01:25:50,376 --> 01:25:52,754
He'd better have remembered
that cranberry sauce.

900
01:25:58,551 --> 01:26:02,096
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.

901
01:26:05,099 --> 01:26:06,601
Peter?

902
01:26:11,314 --> 01:26:12,899
Peter?

903
01:26:14,650 --> 01:26:16,360
Is that you?

904
01:26:21,824 --> 01:26:25,995
How strange. There's nobody here.

905
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:36,964
-Bit of a slob, isn't he?
-All brilliant men are.

906
01:27:09,539 --> 01:27:12,166
-Hey, everyone.
-Oh, Peter!

907
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:14,168
Sorry l'm late"
it's a jungle out there.

908
01:27:14,335 --> 01:27:18,172
I had to beat an oId Iady with a stick
to get these cranberries.

909
01:27:18,631 --> 01:27:21,467
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down. . .

910
01:27:21,634 --> 01:27:23,219
. . .and we can say grace.

911
01:27:24,804 --> 01:27:26,389
Parker.

912
01:27:26,764 --> 01:27:28,516
Here we go.

913
01:27:35,481 --> 01:27:37,817
-There we are.
-lt looks delicious.

914
01:27:38,317 --> 01:27:39,819
Norman.

915
01:27:41,612 --> 01:27:43,906
Will you do the honours?

916
01:27:55,585 --> 01:27:58,838
Why " Peter, you're bleeding.

917
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:02,425
Oh, yeah. . . .

918
01:28:02,592 --> 01:28:07,013
I stepped off a kerb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

919
01:28:07,179 --> 01:28:08,723
Well, let me see.

920
01:28:08,931 --> 01:28:10,516
Oh, my goodness.

921
01:28:10,683 --> 01:28:13,102
-Oh, that looks awful.
-No, it's nothing.

922
01:28:13,269 --> 01:28:16,397
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

923
01:28:16,606 --> 01:28:21,903
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
here, and we'lI do things properly.

924
01:28:22,862 --> 01:28:25,948
How did you say that happened?

925
01:28:26,365 --> 01:28:28,075
Bike messenger.

926
01:28:28,284 --> 01:28:30,244
Knocked me down.

927
01:28:35,625 --> 01:28:39,378
-lf you'll excuse me , l've got to go.
-Why?

928
01:28:40,212 --> 01:28:43,591
Something
has come to my attention.

929
01:28:43,799 --> 01:28:45,051
Are you aIl right?

930
01:28:45,259 --> 01:28:48,763
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.

931
01:28:49,388 --> 01:28:51,766
-Enjoy the fruitcake .
-Dad!

932
01:28:53,935 --> 01:28:57,730
I planned this so you'd meet M.J . "
and now you have to leave?

933
01:28:57,939 --> 01:28:59,649
I've got to go.

934
01:28:59,941 --> 01:29:04,070
-This girl is important to me.
-Harry, please. Look at her.

935
01:29:04,278 --> 01:29:08,240
Think she's sniffing around
because she likes your personallty?

936
01:29:08,491 --> 01:29:11,494
-What are you saying?
-Your mother was beautifuI too.

937
01:29:11,661 --> 01:29:12,828
They're All beautiful.

938
01:29:12,995 --> 01:29:17,083
Until they're snarIing after your trust
fund like a pack of ravening wolves.

939
01:29:17,291 --> 01:29:18,584
You're wrong about her, Dad.

940
01:29:19,085 --> 01:29:22,254
A word to the not-so-wise
about your little girlfriend:

941
01:29:22,463 --> 01:29:25,132
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

942
01:29:36,769 --> 01:29:39,271
Thanks for sticking up for me,
Harry .

943
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:42,441
-You heard?
-Everyone heard that creep.

944
01:29:42,650 --> 01:29:46,529
That creep is my father.
With luck, I'll be half of what he is.

945
01:29:46,779 --> 01:29:49,115
Shut up about stuff
you don't understand!

946
01:29:49,281 --> 01:29:50,950
Harry Osborn!

947
01:29:52,034 --> 01:29:54,078
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

948
01:29:57,039 --> 01:30:00,376
Spider-Man is all but invincible.

949
01:30:00,543 --> 01:30:03,713
But Parker, we can destroy him.

950
01:30:03,879 --> 01:30:05,214
I can't.

951
01:30:05,381 --> 01:30:08,384
Betrayal
must not be countenanced.

952
01:30:08,634 --> 01:30:10,886
Parker must be educated.

953
01:30:13,055 --> 01:30:14,348
What do l do?

954
01:30:14,557 --> 01:30:18,644
lnstruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.

955
01:30:18,811 --> 01:30:21,856
Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.

956
01:30:22,106 --> 01:30:23,399
Yes?

957
01:30:23,566 --> 01:30:25,484
And then grant his wish .

958
01:30:26,402 --> 01:30:27,695
But how?

959
01:30:27,903 --> 01:30:32,199
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.

960
01:30:32,408 --> 01:30:33,576
Tell me how!

961
01:30:33,743 --> 01:30:35,911
The heart, Osborn.

962
01:30:36,162 --> 01:30:39,206
First, we attack his heart.

963
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:44,587
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses. . .

964
01:30:44,795 --> 01:30:47,757
. . .as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

965
01:30:48,049 --> 01:30:51,010
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us--

966
01:30:59,602 --> 01:31:02,146
Deliver us!

967
01:31:02,354 --> 01:31:03,731
Finish it!

968
01:31:04,023 --> 01:31:07,943
-Finish it!
-From evil!

969
01:31:13,657 --> 01:31:15,826
Two milligrams lV.

970
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:18,871
Get the BP .

971
01:31:19,288 --> 01:31:22,875
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?

972
01:31:23,084 --> 01:31:24,418
You have to leave.

973
01:31:24,585 --> 01:31:26,295
-What happened?
-Those eyes!

974
01:31:26,504 --> 01:31:30,549
Those horrible yellow eyes!

975
01:31:35,387 --> 01:31:37,932
He knows who l am.

976
01:32:21,892 --> 01:32:23,477
I'm sorry.

977
01:32:27,189 --> 01:32:29,650
-Will she be okay?
-She's gonna be fine .

978
01:32:29,817 --> 01:32:32,486
She's been sleeping aIl day.

979
01:32:33,487 --> 01:32:36,240
-Thanks for coming.
-Of course.

980
01:32:40,411 --> 01:32:43,330
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

981
01:32:43,497 --> 01:32:47,168
Yeah, l'm fine. l just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

982
01:32:47,418 --> 01:32:50,379
-Have you taIked to Harry?
-He called me.

983
01:32:50,838 --> 01:32:53,007
I haven't cAlled him back.

984
01:32:55,092 --> 01:32:56,802
The fact is. . .

985
01:32:57,970 --> 01:33:00,806
-. . . l'm in love with somebody else.
-You are?

986
01:33:00,973 --> 01:33:02,183
At least l think l am.

987
01:33:04,852 --> 01:33:07,897
-lt's not the right time to talk about it.
-No. Go on.

988
01:33:08,063 --> 01:33:11,317
Would I know his name, this guy?

989
01:33:11,525 --> 01:33:14,403
You'll think l'm a stupid little girl
with a crush.

990
01:33:14,570 --> 01:33:15,946
Trust me.

991
01:33:16,197 --> 01:33:17,448
It's funny.

992
01:33:19,450 --> 01:33:22,828
He's saved my life twice,
and l've never even seen his face.

993
01:33:23,579 --> 01:33:26,957
-Oh. Him.
-You're laughing at me.

994
01:33:27,166 --> 01:33:30,127
No, l understand.
He is extremely cool.

995
01:33:30,336 --> 01:33:33,631
But do you think it's true, all the
terrible things they say about him?

996
01:33:33,797 --> 01:33:37,718
No, no. Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.

997
01:33:37,927 --> 01:33:39,553
I know him a little bit.

998
01:33:39,762 --> 01:33:42,640
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.

999
01:33:42,848 --> 01:33:45,976
-Has he mentioned me?
-Yeah.

1000
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:47,770
What'd he say?

1001
01:33:48,354 --> 01:33:49,688
I said. . . .

1002
01:33:50,773 --> 01:33:55,069
He asked me
what l thought about you.

1003
01:33:55,986 --> 01:33:58,030
And what did you say?

1004
01:33:58,739 --> 01:34:02,826
I said, "Spider-Man."

1005
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:08,040
I said, "The great thing about M.J . . .

1006
01:34:08,249 --> 01:34:09,792
. . .is. . .

1007
01:34:10,709 --> 01:34:13,963
. . .when you look in her eyes. . .

1008
01:34:16,507 --> 01:34:19,718
. . .and she's looking back in yours. . .

1009
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:23,722
. . .everything feels. . .

1010
01:34:24,932 --> 01:34:26,767
. . .not quite normal.

1011
01:34:28,018 --> 01:34:29,812
Because you feel. . .

1012
01:34:30,354 --> 01:34:31,981
. . .stronger. . .

1013
01:34:33,524 --> 01:34:37,152
. . .and weaker at the same time.

1014
01:34:38,195 --> 01:34:40,322
You feel excited. . .

1015
01:34:41,198 --> 01:34:43,242
. . .and at the same time. . .

1016
01:34:43,867 --> 01:34:45,494
. . .terrified.

1017
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:52,126
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel. . .

1018
01:34:53,544 --> 01:34:57,172
. . .except you know what kind of man
you want to be.

1019
01:34:59,883 --> 01:35:01,760
It's as if you've. . .

1020
01:35:02,386 --> 01:35:05,556
. . .reached the unreachable. . .

1021
01:35:07,141 --> 01:35:09,852
. . .and you weren't ready for it."

1022
01:35:13,314 --> 01:35:15,065
You said that?

1023
01:35:15,858 --> 01:35:18,193
Well, something like that.

1024
01:36:02,488 --> 01:36:03,989
Dad?

1025
01:36:09,328 --> 01:36:11,413
Dad, is that you?

1026
01:36:18,003 --> 01:36:19,505
What is it?

1027
01:36:21,757 --> 01:36:26,762
Well, you were right about M.J .
You're right about everything.

1028
01:36:27,763 --> 01:36:30,474
She's in love with Peter.

1029
01:36:30,766 --> 01:36:32,559
-Parker?
-Yeah.

1030
01:36:32,726 --> 01:36:34,686
And how does he feel about her?

1031
01:36:37,272 --> 01:36:39,817
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1032
01:36:40,776 --> 01:36:46,031
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

1033
01:36:48,951 --> 01:36:50,702
I'm so sorry.

1034
01:36:53,163 --> 01:36:56,625
I haven't always been there for you,
have l?

1035
01:36:58,377 --> 01:37:01,588
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.

1036
01:37:01,797 --> 01:37:03,590
That's no excuse.

1037
01:37:04,591 --> 01:37:06,385
I'm proud of you.

1038
01:37:06,927 --> 01:37:11,807
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But l'll make it up to you.

1039
01:37:11,974 --> 01:37:15,310
I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.

1040
01:37:29,366 --> 01:37:31,160
Wake up, little spider.

1041
01:37:31,326 --> 01:37:32,828
Wake up.

1042
01:37:34,163 --> 01:37:35,747
Go home, dear.

1043
01:37:35,956 --> 01:37:37,291
You look awful.

1044
01:37:37,499 --> 01:37:39,793
-And you look beautiful.

01:37:40,002 --> 01:37:43,297

-But l'm safe here.

1046
01:37:43,464 --> 01:37:46,175
-Can l do anything for you?
-You do too much.

1047
01:37:46,341 --> 01:37:51,889
College , a job, All this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1048
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:54,391
A smile. Finally .

1049
01:37:54,558 --> 01:37:57,811
Haven't seen one of those on
your face since Mary Jane was here .

1050
01:37:57,978 --> 01:38:01,356
Hey.
You were supposed to be asleep.

1051
01:38:02,149 --> 01:38:06,945
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J .'s family moved in next door.

1052
01:38:07,154 --> 01:38:11,116
And when she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time . . .

1053
01:38:11,283 --> 01:38:17,623
. . .you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May , is that an angel?"

1054
01:38:17,831 --> 01:38:21,376
-Gee, did l say that?
-You sure did.

1055
01:38:24,046 --> 01:38:26,798
Well, Harry's in love with her.

1056
01:38:27,007 --> 01:38:30,761
-She's still his girl.
-Well" isn't that up to her?

1057
01:38:30,969 --> 01:38:35,557
-She doesn't really know who l am.
-Because you won't let her.

1058
01:38:35,766 --> 01:38:38,894
You're so mysterious aIl the time.

1059
01:38:39,144 --> 01:38:41,897
Tell me, would it be so dangerous. . .

1060
01:38:42,105 --> 01:38:46,068
. . .to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

1061
01:38:46,485 --> 01:38:48,987
Everybody else knows.

1062
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:53,283
I'll be right back.

1063
01:38:53,951 --> 01:38:55,244

And took the spider out

Goblin, what have you done?

1079
01:41:33,235 --> 01:41:37,072
Spider-Man!
This is why only fooIs are heroes.

1080
01:41:37,489 --> 01:41:39,074
Because you never know. . .

1081
01:41:39,282 --> 01:41:44,079
. . .when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:

1082
01:41:45,163 --> 01:41:47,749
Let die the woman you love. . .

1083
01:41:52,129 --> 01:41:57,217

01:41:59,594 --> 01:42:02,055
-Spider-Man!

. . .and see how a hero is rewarded.

1088
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,525
Don't do it, Goblin!

1089
01:42:13,692 --> 01:42:16,611
We are who we choose to be.

01:42:16,862 --> 01:42:19,614
-Now, choose!

01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:24,781
It's time to die.

1103
01:44:31,788 --> 01:44:34,249
Come on up here , tough guy,

01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:41,339
I got something for your ass!

1107
01:44:41,506 --> 01:44:43,383
Mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1108
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:46,011
You mess with one of us,

1109
01:44:59,608 --> 01:45:01,401
Spider-Man, watch out!

1110
01:45:33,266 --> 01:45:37,520
Misery, misery " misery.
That's what you've chosen.

1111
01:45:38,438 --> 01:45:41,066
I offered you friendship. . .

1112
01:45:41,232 --> 01:45:43,109
. . .and you spat in my face.

1113
01:46:34,202 --> 01:46:37,872
You've spun your last web,
Spider-Man.

1114
01:46:38,039 --> 01:46:41,376
Had you not been so selfish,
your little girlfriend's death. . .

1115
01:46:41,543 --> 01:46:43,253
. . .would have been quick
and painless.

1116
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:46,798
But now that you've really
pissed me off. . .

1117
01:46:47,048 --> 01:46:51,928
. . . l'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.

1118
01:46:56,516 --> 01:46:58,560
M.J . and l . . .

1119
01:46:59,394 --> 01:47:02,689
. . .we're gonna have a hell of a time.

1120
01:47:56,493 --> 01:47:58,036
Peter, stop!

1121
01:47:58,203 --> 01:48:00,663
Stop! It's me.

1122
01:48:09,631 --> 01:48:11,049
Mr. Osborn.

1123
01:48:11,257 --> 01:48:12,842
Peter, thank God for you.

1124
01:48:13,051 --> 01:48:15,345
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1125
01:48:15,553 --> 01:48:18,598
The Goblin Killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

1126
01:48:18,765 --> 01:48:20,517
Don't let him take me again.

1127
01:48:20,683 --> 01:48:22,727
I beg you. Protect me.

1128
01:48:22,894 --> 01:48:26,439
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1129
01:48:26,648 --> 01:48:28,149
But not you.

1130
01:48:28,817 --> 01:48:32,779
I tried to stop it.
But l couldn't stop it.

1131
01:48:32,987 --> 01:48:35,073
I would never hurt you.

1132
01:48:35,281 --> 01:48:37,200
I knew from the beginning. . .

1133
01:48:37,408 --> 01:48:40,328
. . .if anything ever happened to me . . .

1134
01:48:40,495 --> 01:48:42,664
. . .it was you l could count on.

1135
01:48:42,831 --> 01:48:46,167
You, Peter Parker" would save me,
and so you have.

1136
01:48:46,751 --> 01:48:48,586
Thank God for you.

1137
01:48:49,587 --> 01:48:51,005
Give me your hand.

1138
01:48:52,173 --> 01:48:55,593
Believe in me
as l believed in you.

1139
01:48:57,011 --> 01:48:59,806
I've been like a father to you.

1140
01:49:01,349 --> 01:49:03,017
Be a son to me now.

1141
01:49:04,811 --> 01:49:06,688
I have a father.

1142
01:49:07,438 --> 01:49:09,941
His name was Ben Parker.

1143
01:49:11,818 --> 01:49:13,278
Godspeed, Spider-Man.

1144
01:49:32,213 --> 01:49:33,715
Peter.

1145
01:49:36,050 --> 01:49:37,343
Don't tell Harry.

1146
01:50:09,584 --> 01:50:11,294
What have you done?

1147
01:50:11,461 --> 01:50:13,046
What have you done?!

1148
01:50:36,319 --> 01:50:37,820
Hey.

1149
01:50:41,199 --> 01:50:43,243
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1150
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:47,288
I know what it's like
to lose a father.

1151
01:50:49,457 --> 01:50:52,752
I didn't lose him.
He was stoIen from me.

1152
01:50:54,337 --> 01:50:56,631
One day Spider-Man will pay.

1153
01:50:58,508 --> 01:51:01,636
I swear on my father's grave ,
Spider-Man will pay.

1154
01:51:06,641 --> 01:51:08,476
Thank God for you, Peter.

1155
01:51:09,185 --> 01:51:11,646
You're the only family l have.

1156
01:51:36,170 --> 01:51:38,464
No matter what l do. . .

1157
01:51:38,631 --> 01:51:41,759
. . .no matter how hard l try . . .

1158
01:51:42,343 --> 01:51:46,180
. . .the ones l love will always
be the ones who pay.

1159
01:51:56,899 --> 01:51:59,235
You must miss him so much.

1160
01:52:00,194 --> 01:52:03,239
It's been so hard without him.

1161
01:52:06,159 --> 01:52:09,037
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1162
01:52:10,830 --> 01:52:12,665
When l was up there. . .

1163
01:52:13,374 --> 01:52:16,169
. . .and l thought l was gonna die. . .

1164
01:52:17,795 --> 01:52:20,548
. . .there was only one person
who l was thinking of.

1165
01:52:22,925 --> 01:52:26,137
And it wasn't who l thought it'd be.

1166
01:52:27,597 --> 01:52:29,557
It was you, Pete.

1167
01:52:30,892 --> 01:52:32,769
I kept thinking:

1168
01:52:33,186 --> 01:52:35,980
"l hope l make it through this. . .

1169
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:41,819
. . .so l can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."

1170
01:52:43,196 --> 01:52:44,697
ReAlly?

1171
01:52:45,073 --> 01:52:50,870
There's only one man
who's always been there for me. . .

1172
01:52:52,121 --> 01:52:54,082
. . .who makes me feel. . .

1173

. . .like l'm more than l ever
thought l could be.

01:53:02,715 --> 01:53:04,217
. . .me.

1176
01:53:05,301 --> 01:53:07,220
And that's okay .

1177
01:53:09,389 --> 01:53:10,890

All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.

1181
01:53:44,507 --> 01:53:46,426
I can't.

1182
01:53:48,553 --> 01:53:50,096
