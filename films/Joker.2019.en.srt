1
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,927
The news never ends.

2
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:12,013
This is 1080 GCR.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,141
You get all the news you need, all day long.

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:16,934
Good morning.

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:20,229
It's 42 degrees at 10:30 on this Thursday, October 15th.

6
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:22,732
I'm Stan L. Brooks, and here's what's happening.

7
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:25,109
It's day 18 of the garbage strike,

8
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:27,904
with 10,000 tons of garbage piling up every day.

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,031
Even the nicest sections of the city

10
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:31,449
are looking like slums.

11
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:33,326
Health Commissioner Edward O'Rourke is

12
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:35,119
declaring a city-wide state of emergency

13
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:36,913
for the first time in decades.

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,165
There's no need to wait until somebody dies

15
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:40,917
or comes down with typhoid fever.

16
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,085
It's already a serious situation.

17
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,295
It's something that affects

18
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,463
almost everyone in the city,

19
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,673
no matter who they are or where they live.

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,051
You can't go down no one avenue

21
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,136
without seeing nothing but garbage and rats.

22
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,471
It's starting to affect my business

23
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,680
when customers can't get in here

24
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,641
because of the garbage situation.

25
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,476
I'm not out that long to smell it,

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,394
but I think to look at it, it's terrible.

27
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,021
It don't affect me except

28
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,731
for the very bad smell here.

29
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:04,899
It's horrific.

30
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:06,275
It's a mess.

31
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,610
I've been in this country for 50 years,

32
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,195
and I've never seen anything like it.

33
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:10,821
What is this world coming to?

34
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,073
Put 'em in a room,

35
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,574
let 'em sit there and talk until they get it over with.

36
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,952
24 hours, 48 hours, how long it takes.

37
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,412
The idea of the National Guard moving in

38
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:19,956
and cleaning up is a good idea.

39
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,207
In other news,

40
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,792
the building industry and landlords today

41
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,460
expressed concern over the latest

42
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,337
increase in heating oil prices.

43
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:27,713
Renters in the metro area

44
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:29,215
are certain to feel the pinch...

45
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:05,835
Yo, what's up with your shoes, bro?

46
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:06,919
Nice outfit, pal.

47
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,296
If you're gonna be a clown, at least you could be

48
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,006
a good one. You know that, right?

49
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,174
- Hey! Hey! - Grab it!

50
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,342
Go, go, go!

51
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,677
Hey!

52
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,053
He's coming!

53
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,723
Come on, clown, let's go! We've got the sign.

54
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,391
- Look at him running. - Let's go!

55
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,475
Stop them!

56
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,436
Go, go, go, go! Watch the car, watch the car!

57
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,148
Where's your sign, clown?

58
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,233
Hey!

59
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,072
Go, clown! Come on!

60
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,324
Stop them!

61
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,618
Go! Come on!

62
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,289
Stop them!

63
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:45,082
Come on, run!

64
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,586
Hey!

65
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,339
You fucking...

66
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,928
Oh, shit! Good hit.

67
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,847
Come on! Beat his ass up.

68
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,766
Come on! This guy's weak. He can't do nothing.

69
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,851
Harder! Harder!

70
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,269
Beat him up. Take his stuff.

71
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,688
Let's go, let's go! Come on. Let's go!

72
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,161
Ha!

73
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:53,252
Is it just me,

74
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,922
or is it getting crazier out there?

75
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,345
- It is certainly tense. - Hmm.

76
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,723
People are upset.

77
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,767
They're struggling. Looking for work.

78
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,311
These are tough times.

79
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,732
How about you?

80
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,444
Have you been keeping up with your journal?

81
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,989
Yes, ma'am.

82
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,909
Great.

83
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,369
Did you bring it with you?

84
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,042
Arthur.

85
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,544
Last time, I asked you to bring your journal

86
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:37,296
with you for these appointments.

87
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,340
Can I see it?

88
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,188
I've been using it as a journal,

89
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,733
but also as a joke diary.

90
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,238
Funny thoughts or observations.

91
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:04,532
I think I told you

92
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:07,785
I'm pursuing a career in stand-up comedy.

93
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,831
No, you didn't.

94
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,293
I think I did.

95
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:28,764
"I just hope my death makes more sense than my life."

96
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,116
How does it feel to have to come here?

97
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,286
Does it help to have someone to talk to?

98
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,583
I think I felt better

99
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,668
when I was locked up in the hospital.

100
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:00,963
And have you thought more about

101
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,716
why you were locked up?

102
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,223
Who knows?

103
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,149
I was wondering if you could ask the doctor

104
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,151
to increase my medication.

105
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,492
Arthur, you're on seven different medications.

106
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,413
Surely, they must be doing something.

107
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,127
I just don't want to feel so bad anymore.

108
00:07:40,127 --> 00:08:10,127
Subtitle www.movieddl.me

109
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,374
Would you please stop bothering my kid?

110
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,544
I wasn't bothering him. I was...

111
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:23,837
Just stop.

112
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:34,181
What? You think that's funny?

113
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,108
I'm sorry. I have a...

114
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,709
I'm sorry.

115
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,059
Happy, did you check the mail

116
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,477
before you came up?

117
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,229
Yeah, Mom.

118
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,689
Nothing.

119
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,402
And finally, tonight,

120
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,488
just when you thought it couldn't get any worse,

121
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:55,948
authorities are saying

122
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,492
the city is under siege by scores of rats.

123
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,952
And not just any rats,

124
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,162
but super rats, who are hard to kill.

125
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,248
He must not be getting my letters.

126
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,415
Yeah.

127
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,668
It's Thomas Wayne, Mom.

128
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,253
He's a busy man.

129
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,131
Please. I worked for that family for years.

130
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,592
The least he could do is write back.

131
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,305
Here. Don't get all worked up. Eat.

132
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,473
You need to eat.

133
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,269
You need to eat. Look how skinny you are.

134
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,438
Both victims were taken to Gotham General.

135
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,648
Sounds like

136
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,732
the city needs to find the Pied Piper.

137
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,569
He'll make a great mayor. Everybody says so.

138
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:37,531
Oh, yeah. Everybody who? Who do you talk to?

139
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,492
Well, everybody on the news.

140
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,828
He's the only one who could save the city.

141
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,329
He owes it to us.

142
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,750
Come sit. It's starting.

143
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,711
Yay, Murray.

144
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:55,007
From NCB Studios in Gotham City,

145
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,468
it's Live with Murray Franklin!

146
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,556
Tonight, Murray welcomes Sandra Winger...

147
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,932
Oh, Sandra Winger's on.

148
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,227
...and the piano stylings of Yeldon and Chantel.

149
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,521
Joining Murray, as always,

150
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,274
Ellis Drane and his jazz orchestra.

151
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:15,110
And now, without further ado,

152
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:18,030
Murray Franklin.

153
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,169
Thank you.

154
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:34,463
Thank you.

155
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,965
We got a great-looking audience tonight.

156
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,259
Yeah!

157
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,136
Wow. Thank you. Thank you.

158
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,638
Thank you.

159
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,724
So, everybody's heard about the super rats that

160
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,226
- are in Gotham now, right? - Yeah.

161
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,688
Well, today, the mayor said he has a solution.

162
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,398
You ready for this?

163
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:54,650
Super cats.

164
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,656
But in all seriousness, I mean, these rats are...

165
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,324
I love you, Murray!

166
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,494
I love you, too.

167
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,997
Hey, Bobby, would you put the lights on?

168
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,165
Who is that?

169
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,501
Was that you? You wanna stand up, please?

170
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,586
Stand up for me.

171
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:15,754
Go ahead.

172
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,636
What's your name?

173
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,180
Hi, Murray. Arthur.

174
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,015
- Arthur? - My name's Arthur.

175
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,850
Oh, okay. Well, there's something special about you,

176
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:29,977
Arthur, I could tell.

177
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,144
Where are you from?

178
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,021
I live right here in the city

179
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,773
with my mother.

180
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,359
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

181
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,443
There's nothing funny about that.

182
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,279
I lived with my mother before I made it. Just me and her.

183
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,282
I'm that kid whose father went out for a pack of cigarettes,

184
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,450
and he never came back.

185
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:46,576
Aww.

186
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,662
I know what that's like, Murray.

187
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,373
I've been the man of the house for as long as I can remember.

188
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,291
I take good care of my mother.

189
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,382
All that sacrifice, she must love you very much.

190
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:01,550
She does.

191
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:06,263
She always tells me to smile and put on a happy face.

192
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,057
She says I was put here to spread joy and laughter.

193
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,600
Aww.

194
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:13,979
Wow.

195
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:19,484
I like that. I like that a lot. Come on down.

196
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:22,487
Come on. For that, you gotta come down.

197
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,072
Come on! Come on.

198
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,040
Come on.

199
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,515
Okay, we got a big show tonight. Stay tuned.

200
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,476
We'll be right back.

201
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,644
That was great, Arthur. Thank you.

202
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,563
I mean, I loved hearing what you had to say.

203
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,939
It made my day.

204
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,316
Thanks, Murray.

205
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,401
You see all this, the lights, the show,

206
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:02,778
the audience, all that stuff?

207
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,112
I'd give it all up in a heartbeat

208
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:05,363
to have a kid like you.

209
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,825
- What's up, ladies? - Hey, Randall. What's up?

210
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,660
Another day in chuckle town.

211
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:52,828
Yup.

212
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,457
You okay?

213
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,920
I heard about the beatdown you took.

214
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:03,755
Fucking savages.

215
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,717
It was just a bunch of kids. I should have left it alone.

216
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:08,844
No.

217
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,346
They'll take everything from you if you do that.

218
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:12,848
All the crazy shit out there.

219
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,100
They're animals.

220
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,897
You know what?

221
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,154
Here.

222
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,073
What is it?

223
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:31,616
Take it.

224
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,618
It's for you.

225
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,041
You gotta protect yourself out there.

226
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,294
Otherwise, you're gonna get fucked.

227
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,088
Randall,

228
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,176
I'm not supposed to have a gun.

229
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,179
Don't sweat it, Art.

230
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,222
No one has to know.

231
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,725
And you can pay me back some other time.

232
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,101
You know you're my boy.

233
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,313
Arthur,

234
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,440
Hoyt wants to see you in his office.

235
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,693
Hey, Gary. You know what I've always wondered?

236
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,986
No idea.

237
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,988
Do you people call it miniature golf

238
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,531
or is it just golf to you?

239
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,288
Punch him in the dick, Gary.

240
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,890
Hello, Hoyt.

241
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,559
Gary said you wanted to see me.

242
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,646
How's the comedy career? Are you a famous stand-up yet?

243
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,772
Not quite.

244
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:46,066
Just been working on my material.

245
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,151
No, don't sit. This'll be quick.

246
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,819
Look, I like you, Arthur.

247
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,404
You know, a lot of the guys,

248
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:52,697
they think you're a freak, but I like you.

249
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,659
I don't even know why I like you.

250
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:57,953
But I got another complaint.

251
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:01,456
It's starting to piss me off. Kenny's Music.

252
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,458
The guy said you disappeared.

253
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,001
Never even returned his sign.

254
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,671
Because I got jumped.

255
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,756
Didn't you hear?

256
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,675
For a sign?

257
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,010
That's bullshit. It doesn't even make sense.

258
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,137
Just get him his sign back.

259
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,682
He's going out of business, for God's sake, Arthur.

260
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,642
Why would I keep his sign?

261
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:23,561
How the fuck do I know? Why does anybody do anything?

262
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,856
If you don't return the sign,

263
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,067
I gotta take it out of your paycheck.

264
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,278
Are we clear?

265
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:35,573
Listen, I'm trying to help you.

266
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,701
Okay? And I'll tell you something else.

267
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,244
The other guys,

268
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,079
they don't feel comfortable around you, Arthur,

269
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,206
because people think you're weird.

270
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,209
Okay? And I can't have that around me.

271
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,052
Wait, wait, wait.

272
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,219
Wait.

273
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:42,599
Thank you.

274
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,207
This building is so awful, isn't it?

275
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,544
This building is so awful, right, Mommy?

276
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,130
Yes, we can hear you, GiGi.

277
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,633
It's so awful, Mommy.

278
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,344
Right, Mommy?

279
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,812
- Good night. - This building's

280
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,021
- so awful, isn't it? - Mmm-hmm.

281
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:36,653
Hey.

282
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,369
Come on.

283
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:57,966
The moon is a silver dollar

284
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:01,052
Shining up in the sky

285
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,680
That's the dream we can buy...

286
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,764
- Look up. - Mmm.

287
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,225
Maybe the mailman's throwing them away.

288
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:10,270
Mom, why are these letters so important to you?

289
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,397
What do you think he's gonna do?

290
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,898
He's gonna help us.

291
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:18,987
But you worked for him, what, 30 years ago?

292
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,030
Why would he help us?

293
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,783
Because Thomas Wayne is a good man.

294
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,245
If he knew how we were living,

295
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,874
if he saw this place, it would make him sick.

296
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,919
I can't explain it to you any better than that.

297
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,673
I don't want you worrying about money, Mom.

298
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,134
Or me.

299
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:42,760
Everybody's telling me

300
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:45,472
that my stand-up's ready for the big clubs.

301
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:49,267
But, Happy, what makes you think you could do that?

302
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,478
- What do you mean? - I mean...

303
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,939
Don't you have to be funny to be a comedian?

304
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,763
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom

305
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,182
The world is in a mess

306
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,559
With politics and taxes And people grinding axes

307
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:32,810
There's no happiness

308
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,356
Happiness is not a riddle

309
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,234
When I'm listening to that Big bass fiddle

310
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,580
Slap that bass Slap it till its dizzy

311
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,999
Slap that bass Keep the rhythm busy

312
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,877
Zoom, zoom, zoom Misery, you've got to go...

313
00:22:58,586 --> 00:22:59,837
Hey, what's your name?

314
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,048
Arthur.

315
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,302
Hey, Arthur, you're a really good dancer.

316
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,137
I know.

317
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,932
You know who's not? Him.

318
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,481
Happy, what was that? Are you okay?

319
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:19,691
Mom, what?

320
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,985
That noise! Did you hear that noise?

321
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,404
I'm watching an old war movie!

322
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,072
Turn it down!

323
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,574
Um...

324
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,122
Sorry, Mom.

325
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:47,969
You good?

326
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:57,872
It's nice to see these couples out at my show.

327
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,042
I have a wife. We love to role-play.

328
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,836
- Ooh! - Yes, yes, very sexy.

329
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,505
My favorite one right now is

330
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,633
professor and senior who really needs

331
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,051
to pass my class to graduate.

332
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:12,470
Yes.

333
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,306
So, I'll tell you how I operate.

334
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:16,599
I'm a professor at

335
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,142
a prestigious New England university...

336
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:23,606
...and my wife is a senior in my "intro To Western Civ."

337
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,818
I know. I know.

338
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:30,154
Why is she a senior in the intro? I didn't buy it either.

339
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,116
So, she comes to me during my office hours.

340
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,868
It's Monday and Wednesday, three to five.

341
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,246
She says, "Excuse me, Professor Lewis."

342
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,331
I can't use my real last name at this college

343
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,041
'cause they don't hire Jews.

344
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,128
It's something I'll address

345
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,838
once I have tenure, but for now...

346
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,173
She says, "Excuse me, Professor Lewis,

347
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,508
I think I might be in danger of failing

348
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,801
your 'intro to Western Civ,'

349
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,094
and I just want you to know

350
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,929
I'm willing to do anything to pass."

351
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:59,142
And I said, "Anything?" And she said...

352
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,919
- Oh, hey. - Hey.

353
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,463
Were you following me today?

354
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,760
Yeah.

355
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,472
I thought that was you.

356
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,725
I was hoping you'd come in and rob the place.

357
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:26,312
I have a gun.

358
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,105
I could come by tomorrow.

359
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,027
You're so funny, Arthur.

360
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,572
Yeah.

361
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:39,242
You know, I do stand-up comedy.

362
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,161
You should maybe come see a show sometime.

363
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,205
I could do that.

364
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:45,498
Yeah?

365
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:47,458
Yeah. You'll let me know when?

366
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:48,626
Yeah.

367
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,760
if you're happy and you know it

368
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:59,011
Wiggle your ears

369
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,096
Wiggle your ears

370
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,390
if you're happy and you know it

371
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:03,558
Wiggle your ears

372
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:04,725
Wiggle your ears

373
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,144
If you're happy and you know it

374
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,313
And you really want to show it

375
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,482
If you're happy and you know it

376
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:12,692
Wiggle your ears

377
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,070
If you're happy and you know it

378
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,446
Stomp your feet

379
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:18,614
Stomp your feet

380
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:20,700
If you're happy and you know it

381
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:21,909
Stomp your feet

382
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,077
Stomp your feet

383
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:25,454
If you're happy and you know it

384
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,665
And you really want to show it

385
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,959
If you're happy and you know it

386
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,294
Stomp your feet

387
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,171
If you're happy and you know it

388
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:35,673
Shout "hurray"

389
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,008
Shout "hurray"

390
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,093
If you're happy and you know it

391
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,595
Shout "hurray"

392
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:41,762
Shout "hurray"

393
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:43,306
If you're happy and you know it

394
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:44,682
And you really want to

395
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:49,186
Hoyt, please, I love this job.

396
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,564
Arthur, I need to know why

397
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,774
you brought a gun into a kids' hospital.

398
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,903
It's a prop. It's part of my act now.

399
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,905
That's bullshit. Bullshit.

400
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,157
What kind of clown carries a fucking gun?

401
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,284
Besides, Randall told me

402
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,329
you tried to buy a .38 off him last week.

403
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,538
Randall told you that?

404
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:10,833
You're a fuck-up, Arthur, and a liar.

405
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,001
You're fired!

406
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,403
Jefferson Street.

407
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:40,988
Next stop, Ninth Ave.

408
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,368
I'm telling you, she wanted my number.

409
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,577
We should've just stayed.

410
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:49,413
You're dreaming, man. She wasn't interested at all.

411
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,791
Are you nuts? Did you see how close we were dancing?

412
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,042
She was in love.

413
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,669
She couldn't wait to get away from you.

414
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,171
Ryan! Ryan, am I crazy? Tell him what you saw.

415
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:01,550
Hey, you want some French fries?

416
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,888
Hello?

417
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,349
Talking to you. Hey.

418
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,059
No, thank you.

419
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,271
You sure?

420
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,274
They're real good.

421
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:22,863
Don't ignore him. He's being nice to you.

422
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,241
Whoo...

423
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,475
Is something funny, asshole?

424
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,064
Bitch!

425
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:06,824
isn't it rich?

426
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,119
Are we a pair?

427
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,249
Me here at last on the ground

428
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:18,419
And you in mid-air

429
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:21,589
Send in the clowns

430
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:27,511
Isn't it bliss?

431
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,973
Don't you approve?

432
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:34,143
One who keeps tearing around

433
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,146
And one who can't move

434
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:40,483
Where are the clowns?

435
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:44,361
There ought to be clowns

436
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:57,041
So, buddy, tell us, what's so fucking funny?

437
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,834
Nothing.

438
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,173
I have... I have a condition.

439
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,842
I'll tell you what you have, you asshole.

440
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,052
Whoa!

441
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:11,931
Please, stop!

442
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,934
We got a kicker, huh?

443
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:16,894
Hey, hold him steady. Hold him steady.

444
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,065
Stay down, freak!

445
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,460
Hey!

446
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:05,025
Ninth Avenue.

447
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:06,277
Next stop, Hunter's Point.

448
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:07,778
Hey!

449
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:15,661
Stand clear of the closing doors.

450
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,201
Shit. Shit.

451
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,667
I read it was a guy in full makeup.

452
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,295
No, it says right here it was a mask.

453
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:55,589
Either way, I think it's good for business.

454
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:58,092
They got clowns on the front of every newspaper.

455
00:36:58,258 --> 00:36:59,468
Big man, what's the good word?

456
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:00,636
Hey.

457
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:05,974
Hey, Arthur, I heard what happened.

458
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,434
Sorry, mate.

459
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:08,602
Yeah.

460
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,521
It doesn't seem fair,

461
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,564
getting fired like that.

462
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:14,858
Did you really bring a gun

463
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:16,360
to the children's hospital, Artie?

464
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,904
What the fuck would you do that for?

465
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:20,364
Is that part of your new act, Arthur?

466
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:21,573
If your dancing doesn't do the trick,

467
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:22,825
you're just gonna shoot yourself?

468
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:25,702
Why don't you ask Randall about it?

469
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:27,830
It was his gun.

470
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,790
- What? - I still owe you for that,

471
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:30,916
don't I?

472
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,835
What the fuck are you talking about?

473
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:35,170
Stop talking out of your ass, Art.

474
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,677
Oh, no!

475
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,139
I forgot to punch out.

476
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,605
And turns to sorrow

477
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:58,986
King of all Hear me call

478
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:04,700
Hear my name Carnival

479
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:17,713
And as our city tries to make sense

480
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,341
of the brutal triple murder on the subway last week,

481
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,010
we're joined by Thomas Wayne.

482
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:25,429
Happy, look, Thomas Wayne's on TV.

483
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:26,763
Yes, Mother.

484
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,182
Thanks for having me on, Chuck.

485
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,641
They're asking him about

486
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,185
those horrible subway murders.

487
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,603
Thank you, Thomas. I know

488
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,438
this is a difficult time for you.

489
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:36,273
Why him?

490
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,317
Looks like he's gained weight.

491
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:40,194
Yes, all three worked for Wayne Investments.

492
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:42,571
Good, decent, educated.

493
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:45,365
Although I didn't know any of them personally.

494
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,494
Like all Wayne employees,

495
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:50,871
past and present, they're family.

496
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:52,706
Did you hear that? I told you, we're family.

497
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,208
There now seems to be

498
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,543
a groundswell of anti-rich sentiment in the city.

499
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,879
It's almost as if our less fortunate residents

500
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,173
are taking the side of the killer.

501
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,008
Yes, and it's a shame.

502
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,468
It's one of the reasons why

503
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:05,761
I'm considering a run for mayor.

504
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:08,847
Gotham's lost its way.

505
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,766
What about the eyewitness report

506
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,560
of the suspect being a man in a clown mask?

507
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,729
Well, it makes total sense to me.

508
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:18,106
What kind of coward would do something that cold-blooded?

509
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,108
Someone who hides behind a mask.

510
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,152
Someone who is envious

511
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:25,656
of those more fortunate than themselves,

512
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:29,159
yet they're too scared to show their own face.

513
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:32,246
And until those kind of people change for the better,

514
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:35,999
those of us who have made something of our lives

515
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,502
will always look at those who haven't

516
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:40,796
as nothing but clowns.

517
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,883
Thomas Wayne, thank you for coming in this morning.

518
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,051
It's not funny.

519
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:10,033
I heard this song on the radio the other day,

520
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:16,873
and the guy was singing that his name was Carnival.

521
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,126
Arthur...

522
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:20,460
Which is crazy,

523
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,882
because that's my clown name at work.

524
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:29,428
And until a little while ago,

525
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:33,181
it was like nobody ever saw me.

526
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,603
Even I didn't know if I really existed.

527
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,397
Arthur, I have some bad news for you.

528
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:45,152
You don't listen, do you?

529
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,824
I don't think you ever really hear me.

530
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:54,703
You just ask the same questions every week.

531
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:58,165
"How's your job? Are you having any negative thoughts?"

532
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,919
All I have are negative thoughts,

533
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,922
but you don't listen anyway.

534
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:09,468
I said, for my whole life,

535
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:12,846
I didn't know if I even really existed.

536
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:15,766
But I do.

537
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:21,146
And people are starting to notice.

538
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:24,650
They've cut our funding.

539
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,485
We're closing down our offices next week.

540
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:30,113
The city has cut funding across the board.

541
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:32,157
Social Services is part of that.

542
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:34,368
This is the last time we'll be meeting.

543
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:36,495
Okay.

544
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,709
They don't give a shit about people like you, Arthur.

545
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,380
And they really don't give a shit

546
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:48,423
about people like me, either.

547
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:53,011
Fuck.

548
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:03,730
How am I supposed to get my medication now?

549
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,318
Who do I talk to?

550
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:12,572
I'm sorry, Arthur.

551
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:18,912
I think... I think most women look at sex like buying a car.

552
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,998
You know, like, "Can I see myself in this long-term?"

553
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,167
"Is it safe?"

554
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:25,794
"Is it reliable?"

555
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:28,213
"Could it kill me?"

556
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,340
Most guys, we look at sex like parking a car.

557
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:32,884
We're like, "There's a spot."

558
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,177
"There's another spot.

559
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:35,345
"That would work."

560
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:38,014
"Oh, I have to pay? Never mind."

561
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:42,436
"Handicapped? I hope no one sees this."

562
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:47,357
All right, that's my time. Thank you very much, guys.

563
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:54,698
One more time for Sam Morril, y'all.

564
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,784
All right, now, this next comic describes

565
00:42:57,868 --> 00:42:59,995
himself as a lifelong Gotham resident

566
00:43:00,162 --> 00:43:02,539
who from a young age was always told

567
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:03,665
that his purpose in life

568
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:07,836
was to bring laughter and joy into this cold, dark world.

569
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,755
Um... Okay.

570
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,174
Please help me welcome Arthur Fleck, y'all.

571
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:13,300
Arthur Fleck.

572
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:40,160
Hello, it's good to be here.

573
00:44:04,935 --> 00:44:07,896
I hated school when I was a kid.

574
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:28,208
I hated school as a kid.

575
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:31,169
My mother would say,

576
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:32,838
"You should enjoy it.

577
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:34,965
One day, you'll have to work for a living."

578
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:37,676
"No, I won't, Ma,

579
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,427
I'm gonna be a comedian."

580
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:49,855
Um...

581
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:53,191
Here's one.

582
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:57,529
You know, I was just thinking the other day,

583
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,573
why are the rich people...

584
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:07,497
Smile though your heart is aching

585
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:15,297
Smile even though it's breaking

586
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:23,346
When there are clouds in the sky You'll get by

587
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:28,894
If you smile Through your fear and sorrow

588
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:34,024
Smile and maybe tomorrow

589
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:39,988
You'll see the sun Come shining through for you

590
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,406
You believe that shit?

591
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,242
Fuck 'em.

592
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:48,914
I think the guy that did it is a hero.

593
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,918
Three less pricks in Gotham City,

594
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,295
only a million more to go.

595
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,799
You'll get by

596
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:04,137
That's the time you must keep on trying

597
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:08,892
Smile, what's the use of crying

598
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:13,521
You'll find that Life is still worthwhile

599
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:19,653
If you just smile

600
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,536
And, buddy, as always,

601
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,746
thanks for the laughs.

602
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:31,414
I'm sure we'll see you again.

603
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:32,791
You know we'll be here, right?

604
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,167
I hope.

605
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,921
Tomorrow night, we have Diana Hudson, Greg Gordon,

606
00:46:38,088 --> 00:46:40,882
and animal expert, Hugh Little.

607
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:42,842
Thanks for watching.

608
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,303
Good night, and always remember,

609
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,846
that's life.

610
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:52,352
That's life.

611
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,568
Momma, time to wake up and go to bed.

612
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:01,778
Hmm? Oh...

613
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,490
Oh, Happy.

614
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,995
Happy, I wrote a new letter.

615
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,871
Come on, dance with me.

616
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:15,250
For Thomas Wayne. It's important.

617
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,885
You smell like cologne.

618
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:28,513
It's 'cause I just had a big date.

619
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,473
Oh.

620
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,936
Just don't forget to mail it.

621
00:48:00,754 --> 00:48:02,422
The Murray Franklin Show is taped live

622
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,882
before a studio audience

623
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:06,176
in beautiful downtown Gotham City.

624
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:11,116
You're gonna kill me. You're gonna give me a heart attack!

625
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,450
Don't give me your...

626
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:14,452
No. No.

627
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:17,580
I'm not talking to you until you stop being angry!

628
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:18,915
Okay.

629
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:20,166
Okay.

630
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,006
I'm not angry, Mom.

631
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:29,509
I'm not angry.

632
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:30,885
Please.

633
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:34,681
Mom, is this real?

634
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:41,563
He's an extraordinary man, Happy.

635
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:44,065
He's a very powerful man.

636
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,569
We were in love.

637
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,363
He said it was best that we not be together

638
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,574
because of appearances.

639
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:58,413
And I could never tell anyone because...

640
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:02,417
Well, I signed some papers.

641
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:05,879
And besides, you can imagine

642
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:09,340
what people would say about Thomas and me.

643
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,428
What they'd say about you.

644
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,559
What would they say, Mom?

645
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:09,711
Hmm.

646
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:21,681
Hmm.

647
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:53,838
Hi.

648
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,176
What's your name?

649
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:01,054
I'm Bruce.

650
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:03,306
Bruce.

651
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:06,517
I'm Arthur.

652
00:53:28,498 --> 00:53:29,874
That's better.

653
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:32,377
Bruce! Bruce!

654
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:35,046
Get away from that man.

655
00:53:35,213 --> 00:53:37,340
It's okay. I'm a good guy.

656
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:38,758
What are you doing? Who are you?

657
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:41,052
I'm here to see Mr. Wayne.

658
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:43,721
Well, you shouldn't be speaking to his son.

659
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,307
Why did you give him these flowers?

660
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:47,683
No, they're not real.

661
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,479
It's magic.

662
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:53,356
I was just trying to make him smile.

663
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:55,358
Well, it's not funny, is it?

664
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:57,568
Do I need to call the police?

665
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,153
No. Please.

666
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:03,658
My mother's name is Penny. Penny Fleck.

667
00:54:03,825 --> 00:54:04,909
She used to work here years ago.

668
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:07,161
Can you please tell Mr. Wayne I need to see him?

669
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:09,789
You are her son.

670
00:54:09,956 --> 00:54:10,957
Yeah.

671
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:13,334
Did you know her?

672
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:19,298
I know about the two of them.

673
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,301
She told me everything.

674
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,972
There's nothing to know.

675
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:28,891
There is no "them."

676
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:32,019
Your mother was delusional.

677
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,021
She was a sick woman.

678
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,232
Don't say that.

679
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,818
Just go.

680
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:39,944
Mmm?

681
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:42,321
Before you make a fool of yourself.

682
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:46,659
Thomas Wayne is my father.

683
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:52,707
He left me.

684
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:56,836
Let go! Let go!

685
00:55:23,196 --> 00:55:25,031
Keep the respirations above 15.

686
00:55:25,198 --> 00:55:27,366
Slow and steady. We got some stairs coming up.

687
00:55:28,618 --> 00:55:29,827
Mom?

688
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:31,662
What happened?

689
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,498
- Who are you? - I'm her son.

690
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:35,082
- What happened? - You can probably help us out inside.

691
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:36,584
We don't know what happened yet.

692
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,586
- Hop in the back of the ambulance. - Step.

693
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:39,921
One more. We got one more lift.

694
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,047
I'm getting

695
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,298
a little resistance here, Michael.

696
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:46,052
Lift.

697
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:52,934
I'm right here.

698
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:54,519
Excuse me, sir.

699
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:55,811
Does your mother take any medications?

700
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:56,979
- No. - Excuse me,

701
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:58,105
- I couldn't hear you. - No.

702
00:55:58,189 --> 00:55:59,774
Sir, when was the last time you spoke to her?

703
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,025
I don't know.

704
00:56:45,945 --> 00:56:47,154
Mr. Fleck.

705
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:50,491
Sorry to bother you. I'm Detective Garrity.

706
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:52,868
This is my partner, Detective Burke.

707
00:56:53,286 --> 00:56:55,955
We had a few questions for you, but you weren't home,

708
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,958
so we spoke with your mother.

709
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:01,711
Oh.

710
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,297
What did you say to her?

711
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:05,464
Did you do this?

712
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:06,632
What? No.

713
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,260
No, no, no. We just asked her some questions,

714
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:10,928
and she got hysterical.

715
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:12,847
Hyperventilating,

716
00:57:13,014 --> 00:57:14,140
collapsed and hit her head pretty hard.

717
00:57:14,307 --> 00:57:16,434
Yeah. The doctor said she had a stroke.

718
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,894
We're sorry to hear about that.

719
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,607
But, like I said, I still have some questions for you.

720
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,025
They're about the subway killings

721
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:25,151
that happened last week.

722
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:26,611
You've heard about them, right?

723
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:27,862
Yeah.

724
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:29,030
It's horrible.

725
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:30,406
Right.

726
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:34,493
So, we spoke with your boss over at Haha's.

727
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,704
He said you were fired for bringing a gun

728
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,247
into the children's hospital.

729
00:57:39,749 --> 00:57:41,751
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck? - It was a prop.

730
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,461
It's part of my act.

731
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:45,212
I'm a party clown.

732
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:47,298
All right. So, why were you fired?

733
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:53,137
They said I wasn't funny enough.

734
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:55,264
Can you imagine that?

735
00:57:55,431 --> 00:57:59,268
If you don't mind, I have to go take care of my mother.

736
00:57:59,435 --> 00:58:01,687
Your boss also gave us one of your cards.

737
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:06,233
This condition of yours, the laughing,

738
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,319
is it real,

739
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:10,321
or some sort of clown thing?

740
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:13,366
- A clown thing? - Yeah.

741
00:58:13,783 --> 00:58:16,077
I mean, is it part of your act?

742
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:19,997
What do you think?

743
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,004
It's exit only.

744
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:53,489
She's gonna be okay.

745
00:58:57,952 --> 00:58:59,662
I'm gonna get a coffee.

746
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:01,372
You want one?

747
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:02,540
Yeah.

748
00:59:15,678 --> 00:59:18,639
So, the other night, I told my youngest son Billy,

749
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:21,267
you know, the new one, the not-so-bright one.

750
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:23,602
I told him, "The garbage strike

751
00:59:23,686 --> 00:59:24,937
is still going on, Billy."

752
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:27,189
And he says, and I'm not kidding, Billy says,

753
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:29,066
"So, where are we gonna get all our garbage from?"

754
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:39,160
And finally, in a world where everyone

755
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:40,578
thinks they could do my job,

756
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:42,955
we got this video tape from Pogo's Comedy Club,

757
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:44,165
right here in Gotham.

758
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,250
Here's a guy who thinks if you just keep laughing,

759
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,127
it'll somehow make you funny.

760
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,545
Check out this joker.

761
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:56,343
Oh, my God.

762
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:59,972
I hated school as a kid.

763
01:00:00,848 --> 01:00:03,893
But my mother would always say,

764
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,644
"You should enjoy it.

765
01:00:05,728 --> 01:00:07,855
One day, you'll have to work for a living."

766
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,065
"No, I won't, Ma.

767
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:11,859
I'm gonna be a comedian."

768
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:20,284
You shoulda listened to your mother.

769
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,121
Hey, one more. One more, Bobby.

770
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,707
All right, let's see one more. I love this guy.

771
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:28,542
It's funny,

772
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:31,545
when I was a little boy

773
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:34,548
and told people I was gonna be a comedian,

774
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,759
everyone laughed at me.

775
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:39,720
Well, no one's laughing now.

776
01:00:43,224 --> 01:00:45,100
You can say that again, pal.

777
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:53,734
All right, we got a great show for you tonight.

778
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:57,071
Chuck Conby is here, actress Joanne Mulligan,

779
01:00:57,238 --> 01:01:01,075
and new music from Mel Rubin and the Stiffs.

780
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:09,583
As tensions mount around the metro area,

781
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:13,337
Mayor Stokes has pleaded for cooler heads to prevail.

782
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,089
City services have been affected,

783
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:17,258
and some businesses have decided

784
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:20,135
to remain closed amid the unrest.

785
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:22,888
Chuck Stevens filed this report.

786
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:24,223
The anger and resentment

787
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:25,599
that's been building in the city for weeks

788
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:27,768
seems close to exploding.

789
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,979
Protesters, many dressed as clowns,

790
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:31,188
took to the streets today

791
01:01:31,397 --> 01:01:33,190
in one of several planned demonstrations

792
01:01:33,274 --> 01:01:34,817
taking on the city's elite,

793
01:01:34,984 --> 01:01:36,735
including a massive rally outside

794
01:01:36,819 --> 01:01:39,238
tomorrow night's benefit at Wayne Hall.

795
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:40,531
What's the point of all this?

796
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:42,908
- the rich. - Thomas Wayne.

797
01:01:42,992 --> 01:01:44,535
That's what this whole thing is about.

798
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:46,579
the whole system.

799
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:47,830
Wayne, who recently announced

800
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,123
he is running for mayor,

801
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:51,000
will be attending the benefit.

802
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,168
You might remember it was Thomas Wayne

803
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:54,712
who first referred to

804
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:57,590
many of Gotham's residents as "clowns."

805
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,759
Today, he offered little in the way of an apology.

806
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,177
Well, what I will say is,

807
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:03,387
there's something wrong with those people.

808
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:04,555
I am here to help them.

809
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:06,015
I'm gonna lift them out of poverty,

810
01:02:06,098 --> 01:02:07,516
help make their lives better.

811
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:08,851
That is why I'm running.

812
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:11,770
And they may not realize it, but I'm their only hope.

813
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:30,289
Down with Wayne! Down with Wayne!

814
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:33,125
Down with Wayne! Down with Wayne!

815
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:14,787
Can I help you, pal?

816
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,707
I don't know what to say.

817
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:24,546
Do you want an autograph or something?

818
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:25,714
No.

819
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:33,388
My name is Arthur.

820
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:36,600
Penny Fleck is my mother.

821
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:38,977
Jesus.

822
01:05:40,062 --> 01:05:41,688
You're the guy that came to my house yesterday.

823
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:44,566
Yes.

824
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:46,985
I'm sorry I just showed up.

825
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,612
But my mother told me everything,

826
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,364
and I had to talk to you.

827
01:05:50,531 --> 01:05:52,449
Look, pal, I'm not your father.

828
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:54,535
What's wrong with you?

829
01:05:56,203 --> 01:05:57,746
Look at us.

830
01:05:59,248 --> 01:06:00,499
I think you are.

831
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:01,875
Well, that's impossible

832
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:03,710
because you're adopted,

833
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:04,920
and I never slept with your mother.

834
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:06,588
- I wasn't adopted. - What do you want from me?

835
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:08,048
- Money? - No, I don't...

836
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:09,258
I wasn't adopted.

837
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:11,218
Jesus. She never told you?

838
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:13,053
Told me what?

839
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:16,223
Your mother adopted you while she was working for us.

840
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:17,599
That's not true.

841
01:06:18,142 --> 01:06:19,143
Why are you saying that?

842
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:20,310
Then she was arrested and committed

843
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:21,562
to Arkham State Hospital,

844
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,105
when you were just a little boy.

845
01:06:23,272 --> 01:06:24,398
Why are you saying this?

846
01:06:24,565 --> 01:06:26,066
I don't need you to tell me lies.

847
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:27,568
I know it seems strange.

848
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:29,278
I don't mean to make you uncomfortable.

849
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:31,029
I don't know why everyone is so rude.

850
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:32,406
I don't know why you are.

851
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:33,907
I don't want anything from you.

852
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:36,451
Maybe a little bit of warmth, maybe a hug, Dad!

853
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:38,620
How about just a little bit of fucking decency?

854
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:40,164
What is it with you people?

855
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,291
You say that stuff about my mother.

856
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:43,834
She's crazy.

857
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:46,003
She's...

858
01:06:53,594 --> 01:06:54,970
You think this is funny?

859
01:06:56,597 --> 01:06:59,766
Dad, it's me. Come on.

860
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:03,645
Touch my son again,

861
01:07:03,729 --> 01:07:05,105
I'll fucking kill you.

862
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:27,836
Hello, Mr. Fleck. This is Detective Garrity.

863
01:07:28,003 --> 01:07:30,339
We met the other night at Gotham General.

864
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,799
My partner and I had a few more questions for you.

865
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:35,886
We stopped by your apartment today, but you weren't home.

866
01:07:36,053 --> 01:07:37,804
Please give me a call when you get this message.

867
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,890
Again, Detective Garrity,

868
01:07:40,057 --> 01:07:44,061
and my number is 212...99.

869
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:28,939
This message is for Arthur Fleck.

870
01:08:29,106 --> 01:08:30,816
My name is Shirley Woods.

871
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:33,068
I work on The Murray Franklin Show.

872
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:34,236
I don't know if you're aware,

873
01:08:34,403 --> 01:08:35,946
but Murray played a clip of your stand-up

874
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:37,072
on the show recently,

875
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:40,534
and we have gotten an amazing response from our viewers.

876
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:42,911
Murray asked me to give you a call and see if you're...

877
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,667
Who is this?

878
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:50,460
Oh, hi, this is Shirley Woods.

879
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:53,422
I'm the show booker from Live with Murray Franklin.

880
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:54,631
Is this Arthur?

881
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:57,634
Yes.

882
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,761
Hi, Arthur. Well, as I was saying,

883
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:01,847
we've gotten a lot of calls about your clip.

884
01:09:02,014 --> 01:09:03,724
Amazing responses.

885
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,184
And Murray asked if I would reach out to you

886
01:09:06,268 --> 01:09:07,894
to see if you would come on as his guest.

887
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:16,320
Murray wants me on The Murray Franklin Show?

888
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,071
Yeah. Isn't that great?

889
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:21,116
He'd love to talk to you, maybe do some of your act?

890
01:09:22,117 --> 01:09:24,286
That sound good to you?

891
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:30,667
Yeah, that sounds great.

892
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,669
Can we set up a date right now?

893
01:09:32,753 --> 01:09:34,463
Are you available next Thursday?

894
01:10:27,182 --> 01:10:28,183
Hey.

895
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:31,978
Man, I'm sorry about that, my man.

896
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:34,272
All records 10 years or older, they store in the basement,

897
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:37,442
and you're talking about something 30 years ago, so...

898
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:40,779
Can I ask you a question?

899
01:10:40,946 --> 01:10:42,155
Sure.

900
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:46,660
How does someone wind up in here?

901
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:51,248
Have they all, all the people committed crimes?

902
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:53,542
Well, yeah, some have.

903
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:56,586
You know, some are just crazy.

904
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:59,214
Pose dangers to themselves and others.

905
01:10:59,381 --> 01:11:00,966
Some just got nowhere else to go.

906
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:03,135
Don't know what to do, you know?

907
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:06,972
- Yeah. I hear you, brother. - Hmm.

908
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:09,891
Sometimes, I don't know what to do.

909
01:11:11,435 --> 01:11:14,104
Last time, I ended up taking it out on some people.

910
01:11:15,564 --> 01:11:19,192
I thought it was gonna bother me, but it really hasn't.

911
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:21,528
What's that?

912
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:26,450
I fucked up and did some bad shit.

913
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:31,413
You know what I'm talking about,

914
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:36,918
it's so hard to just try and be happy all the time.

915
01:11:39,004 --> 01:11:40,714
Hey, listen, man.

916
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:43,175
I'm just an administrative assistant.

917
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:44,759
Like a clerk, you know.

918
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:46,511
All I do is file paperwork.

919
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,347
I don't know what to tell you.

920
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:51,308
But you should see somebody.

921
01:11:51,475 --> 01:11:52,726
You know, they got programs,

922
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:55,353
city services, stuff like that.

923
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,855
Oh, yeah.

924
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:58,440
They cut all those.

925
01:12:03,612 --> 01:12:05,614
All right, here it is. Fleck.

926
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,699
Penny Fleck. Let's see.

927
01:12:08,617 --> 01:12:12,204
Diagnosed by Dr. Benjamin Stoner.

928
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:17,792
Oh. "The patient suffers from delusional psychosis

929
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:21,421
and narcissistic personality disorder." Mmm.

930
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:23,715
"Was found guilty of endangering

931
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:27,219
the welfare of her own child."

932
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:36,520
What?

933
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:41,399
You said she's your mother.

934
01:12:46,363 --> 01:12:47,489
Uh...

935
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:50,075
I'm sorry, man. Like I said, I can't release these records,

936
01:12:50,242 --> 01:12:52,994
you know, without proper forms.

937
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:55,121
I could get in trouble.

938
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:57,958
Look, if you want to bring your mom in here to sign,

939
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,125
that'll be much easier,

940
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:02,337
but I can't let this go without her signature, okay?

941
01:13:02,504 --> 01:13:03,505
I'm sorry.

942
01:13:07,676 --> 01:13:09,886
No, man! Shit!

943
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:12,347
Come on, man. Give it...

944
01:13:13,265 --> 01:13:15,559
Hey! Hey!

945
01:14:13,742 --> 01:14:16,661
We went over this, Penny. You adopted him.

946
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,164
We have all the paperwork right here.

947
01:14:19,873 --> 01:14:22,083
That's not true.

948
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,502
Thomas had that all made up,

949
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:27,297
so it stayed our secret.

950
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:31,635
You also stood by

951
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:33,595
while one of your boyfriends

952
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:37,140
repeatedly abused your adopted son

953
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:39,517
and battered you.

954
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:00,872
Penny,

955
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:05,085
your son was found tied to a radiator

956
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:07,671
in your filthy apartment.

957
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:10,340
Malnourished with multiple bruises across his body

958
01:15:10,507 --> 01:15:12,509
and severe trauma to his head.

959
01:15:14,678 --> 01:15:16,388
I never heard him cry.

960
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:20,767
He's always been such a happy little boy.

961
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:23,264
It's time for bed.

962
01:17:26,768 --> 01:17:27,769
Oh, my God!

963
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:30,480
What are you doing in here?

964
01:17:32,941 --> 01:17:34,818
You're in the wrong apartment.

965
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:43,159
Your name's Arthur, right?

966
01:17:43,785 --> 01:17:44,994
You live down the hall.

967
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:49,999
I really need you to leave.

968
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:57,257
My little girl is sleeping in the other room.

969
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:03,471
Please.

970
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,393
I had a bad day.

971
01:18:11,229 --> 01:18:13,731
Can I call someone? Is your mother home?

972
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:41,694
Shut up!

973
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,298
Hey, Penny.

974
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:06,094
Penny Fleck.

975
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:16,104
I always hated that name.

976
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:21,651
You know how you used to tell me

977
01:20:23,695 --> 01:20:26,322
that my laugh was a condition?

978
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,951
That there was something wrong with me?

979
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:34,247
There isn't.

980
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:38,459
That's the real me.

981
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:40,795
Happy.

982
01:20:43,006 --> 01:20:45,466
Happy. Hmm.

983
01:20:48,803 --> 01:20:51,597
I haven't been happy

984
01:20:51,681 --> 01:20:53,933
one minute of my entire fucking life.

985
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:02,316
You know what's funny?

986
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:06,863
You know what really makes me laugh?

987
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,659
I used to think that my life was a tragedy...

988
01:21:13,411 --> 01:21:15,413
...but now I realize

989
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,165
it's a fucking comedy.

990
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:28,861
A very fine actor.

991
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:32,031
He's got a new movie called American Playboy

992
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:34,075
opening this week across the country.

993
01:22:34,242 --> 01:22:36,077
Will you please welcome a good friend

994
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,246
of the show, Mr. Ethan Chase.

995
01:22:57,932 --> 01:22:59,642
Good to see you, Ethan. You're looking great, Ethan.

996
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:01,602
Thank you very much. You're looking good yourself.

997
01:23:01,769 --> 01:23:02,812
Ah, can't complain.

998
01:23:03,271 --> 01:23:05,565
Hey, Murray. Thanks so much for having...

999
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:07,942
Hey, Murray.

1000
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:10,111
Thank you so much for having me on the show.

1001
01:23:10,695 --> 01:23:12,822
It's been a lifelong dream of mine.

1002
01:23:15,116 --> 01:23:16,284
I'm nervous right now.

1003
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:19,412
- You are? - I am nervous.

1004
01:23:20,371 --> 01:23:21,914
Hey, Murray. I've been on...

1005
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:36,804
I'm sorry. What's that?

1006
01:23:38,181 --> 01:23:39,974
Oh, that's very funny, Murray.

1007
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:43,436
You know, I'm also a comedian.

1008
01:23:43,603 --> 01:23:44,896
Would you like to hear a joke?

1009
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:48,316
Yeah? All of you?

1010
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:49,817
Okay.

1011
01:23:52,862 --> 01:23:53,946
Knock...

1012
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:55,156
Knock, knock.

1013
01:24:09,045 --> 01:24:10,338
Knock, knock.

1014
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:32,443
That's life

1015
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:34,237
That's life

1016
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:37,240
That's what all the people say

1017
01:24:38,658 --> 01:24:41,535
You're riding high in April

1018
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:44,288
Shot down in May

1019
01:24:44,372 --> 01:24:49,043
But I know I'm gonna change that tune

1020
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:55,216
When I'm back on top Back on top in June

1021
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,219
I said, that's life

1022
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:00,346
That's life

1023
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:03,641
And as funny as it may seem

1024
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:06,686
Some people get their kicks

1025
01:25:07,395 --> 01:25:10,064
Stompin' on a dream

1026
01:25:10,815 --> 01:25:14,568
But I don't let it, let it get me down

1027
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:18,698
'Cause this fine old world

1028
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:21,284
It keeps spinnin' around

1029
01:25:22,118 --> 01:25:25,371
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate

1030
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:28,958
A poet, a pawn and a king

1031
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:33,087
I've been up and down and over and out

1032
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:35,298
And I know one thing

1033
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:41,012
Each time I find myself flat on my face

1034
01:25:42,013 --> 01:25:48,185
I pick myself up And get back in the race

1035
01:25:48,269 --> 01:25:49,395
That's life

1036
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,147
That's life

1037
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:54,108
I tell ya, I can't deny it

1038
01:25:55,693 --> 01:25:57,570
I thought of quitting, baby

1039
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:01,365
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it

1040
01:26:01,449 --> 01:26:04,910
And if I didn't think It was worth one single try

1041
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:08,748
Coming.

1042
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:12,376
I'd jump right on a big bird And then I'd fly...

1043
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:21,260
Hey, Arthur.

1044
01:26:21,427 --> 01:26:22,428
How's it going?

1045
01:26:23,429 --> 01:26:24,722
Oh, hey, guys.

1046
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:26,390
Come on in.

1047
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:27,975
Did you get a new gig?

1048
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:29,685
No.

1049
01:26:30,603 --> 01:26:33,647
Oh, you must be going down to that rally at City Hall.

1050
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:35,483
I hear it's gonna be nuts.

1051
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:37,234
Oh, is that today?

1052
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:38,944
Yeah.

1053
01:26:39,862 --> 01:26:41,280
What's with the makeup then?

1054
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:44,241
My mom died.

1055
01:26:44,408 --> 01:26:45,618
I'm celebrating.

1056
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:47,536
Right. We heard.

1057
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:48,746
That's why we came by.

1058
01:26:48,913 --> 01:26:51,624
We figured, you know, you could use some cheering up.

1059
01:26:52,166 --> 01:26:53,793
Aw, that's sweet.

1060
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,837
But, no, I feel good.

1061
01:26:57,630 --> 01:26:59,256
Yeah, I stopped taking my medication.

1062
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:01,050
I feel a lot better now.

1063
01:27:03,177 --> 01:27:05,679
Oh, okay. Good for you.

1064
01:27:07,807 --> 01:27:10,684
So, hey, listen, I don't know if you heard,

1065
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:13,270
but the cops have been coming around the shop,

1066
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:17,942
talking to all the guys about those subway murders.

1067
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:19,860
- And, um... - They didn't talk to me.

1068
01:27:21,821 --> 01:27:24,490
That's because the suspect was a regular-sized person.

1069
01:27:25,032 --> 01:27:27,535
If it was a fucking midget, you'd be in jail right now.

1070
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:34,583
Anyway, um,

1071
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:38,754
Hoyt said that they talked to you,

1072
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:40,214
and now they're looking for me,

1073
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:41,882
and I just wanna know what you said.

1074
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:43,467
Make sure our stories line up.

1075
01:27:43,634 --> 01:27:46,679
- Seeing as how you're my boy. - Yeah, that's important.

1076
01:27:46,846 --> 01:27:48,556
- That makes a lot of sense. - You know what I mean?

1077
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:50,349
Thank you, Randall. Thank you so much.

1078
01:27:56,147 --> 01:27:57,148
Arthur!

1079
01:27:57,815 --> 01:27:59,150
No!

1080
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:01,485
What?

1081
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:03,821
No!

1082
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:13,831
Why would you do that, Arthur?

1083
01:28:34,894 --> 01:28:37,062
Do you watch The Murray Franklin Show?

1084
01:28:37,146 --> 01:28:38,564
Yeah.

1085
01:28:39,899 --> 01:28:41,692
I'm gonna be on tonight.

1086
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:47,740
It fucking crazy, innit?

1087
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:49,658
Me on the telly.

1088
01:28:51,702 --> 01:28:53,662
What the fuck, Arthur?

1089
01:28:54,914 --> 01:28:55,998
What?

1090
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:02,213
It's okay, Gary.

1091
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:03,672
You can go.

1092
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:07,885
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1093
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,306
Oh!

1094
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:14,642
Don't look. Just go.

1095
01:29:27,196 --> 01:29:28,197
Fuck.

1096
01:29:33,494 --> 01:29:34,662
Hey, Arthur?

1097
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:35,829
Yeah?

1098
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:39,458
Arthur, can you get the lock?

1099
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:43,671
Shit.

1100
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:45,589
Sorry, Gary.

1101
01:29:56,559 --> 01:29:57,601
Gary?

1102
01:29:57,768 --> 01:29:58,769
Yeah.

1103
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:03,899
You were the only one that was ever nice to me.

1104
01:30:05,985 --> 01:30:07,194
Skedaddle.

1105
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:35,741
Hey, Arthur!

1106
01:31:35,908 --> 01:31:37,284
We need to talk.

1107
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:38,661
Oh!

1108
01:31:38,744 --> 01:31:40,746
Hey! Stop, Arthur!

1109
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:47,252
Arthur!

1110
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:51,465
Watch it! Out of the way!

1111
01:31:54,635 --> 01:31:55,636
Move!

1112
01:31:57,638 --> 01:31:58,639
Arthur!

1113
01:31:59,682 --> 01:32:00,933
Shit.

1114
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:04,395
Hey! Hey!

1115
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:12,444
Arthur, stop!

1116
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:19,159
Go! Go!

1117
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:23,163
Now departing, O-Train, downtown.

1118
01:32:25,124 --> 01:32:26,875
Stand clear of the closing doors.

1119
01:32:36,301 --> 01:32:38,929
Hold that train! Hold it!

1120
01:32:40,848 --> 01:32:42,057
Get out! Get outta here!

1121
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:44,727
Next stop, Bedford Park.

1122
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,200
Masks off!

1123
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:01,744
Get your mask off!

1124
01:33:02,578 --> 01:33:04,329
Signs down! Now!

1125
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:14,965
Police! Signs down!

1126
01:33:16,133 --> 01:33:17,217
Signs down.

1127
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,098
What the fuck!

1128
01:33:26,018 --> 01:33:27,227
Beat his ass!

1129
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:35,486
Stop fighting! Police!

1130
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:37,780
Police! Get down!

1131
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:42,075
Get down! Get the fuck back!

1132
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,161
Police! Get down.

1133
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:46,205
Get the fuck down!

1134
01:33:50,918 --> 01:33:53,337
Stay the fuck back! Down!

1135
01:33:56,965 --> 01:33:57,966
What the...

1136
01:34:01,345 --> 01:34:02,346
Arthur!

1137
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:03,972
Burke!

1138
01:34:05,599 --> 01:34:07,059
Don't do it!

1139
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,068
Two officers on the train

1140
01:34:58,151 --> 01:34:59,570
were violently confronted by the crowd,

1141
01:34:59,736 --> 01:35:01,154
and tonight are in serious

1142
01:35:01,238 --> 01:35:03,448
but stable condition at Gotham Metropolitan.

1143
01:35:03,532 --> 01:35:05,117
We're going live now to

1144
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,994
co-anchor Courtney Weathers,

1145
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,079
who's standing by outside the Bedford Park Station,

1146
01:35:09,246 --> 01:35:11,081
near where the shooting took place.

1147
01:35:11,248 --> 01:35:13,125
Courtney, what's the scene there?

1148
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:19,172
Murray.

1149
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:20,924
Hey, hey, hey. It's Mr. Franklin, buddy.

1150
01:35:21,091 --> 01:35:23,468
Oh, come on, Gene. That's all bullshit.

1151
01:35:24,553 --> 01:35:25,762
Thank you, Murray.

1152
01:35:26,972 --> 01:35:28,724
I feel like I know you.

1153
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:31,059
I've been watching you forever.

1154
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:32,352
Thank you.

1155
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:33,812
What's with the face?

1156
01:35:33,979 --> 01:35:35,939
I mean, are you part of the protest?

1157
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:37,107
No.

1158
01:35:37,274 --> 01:35:39,026
No, I don't believe in any of that.

1159
01:35:39,735 --> 01:35:41,320
I don't believe in anything.

1160
01:35:41,945 --> 01:35:43,488
I just thought it'd be good for my act.

1161
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:45,157
For your act? Didn't you hear

1162
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,575
what happened on the subway? Some clown got killed.

1163
01:35:46,742 --> 01:35:48,285
He's aware of that. He's aware of that. Yeah.

1164
01:35:48,452 --> 01:35:49,703
No, I hadn't heard.

1165
01:35:50,162 --> 01:35:51,246
- Yeah. - You see?

1166
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:52,664
This is what I'm telling you. The audience is gonna go crazy

1167
01:35:52,748 --> 01:35:53,707
if you put this guy on.

1168
01:35:53,874 --> 01:35:56,001
Maybe for a bit, but not a whole segment.

1169
01:35:56,168 --> 01:35:58,378
Gene, it's gonna work. It's gonna work.

1170
01:35:59,171 --> 01:36:01,131
We're gonna go with it.

1171
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:02,507
Thank you, Murray.

1172
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:04,217
Couple rules, though.

1173
01:36:04,384 --> 01:36:06,136
No cursing. No off-color material.

1174
01:36:06,303 --> 01:36:07,763
We do a clean show.

1175
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:08,931
- Okay? - Mmm-hmm.

1176
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:10,682
You'll go on right after Dr. Sally.

1177
01:36:10,849 --> 01:36:11,850
I love Dr. Sally.

1178
01:36:12,017 --> 01:36:13,435
Good, good. Someone will

1179
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:15,687
- come and get you, okay? - Okay. Perfect.

1180
01:36:15,771 --> 01:36:16,897
Good luck.

1181
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:17,981
- Thanks, Murray. - Okay.

1182
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:22,402
- Murray, one small thing. - Yeah.

1183
01:36:22,569 --> 01:36:24,237
When you bring me out,

1184
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:26,281
can you introduce me as Joker?

1185
01:36:26,448 --> 01:36:28,158
What's wrong with your real name?

1186
01:36:28,784 --> 01:36:31,036
That's what you called me on the show.

1187
01:36:31,203 --> 01:36:32,329
A joker.

1188
01:36:32,496 --> 01:36:33,497
Do you remember?

1189
01:36:33,872 --> 01:36:35,874
- Did I? - I don't know.

1190
01:36:36,041 --> 01:36:38,126
Well, if you say so, kid, you know, Joker it is.

1191
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:39,294
It's good.

1192
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:40,545
Thanks, Murray.

1193
01:37:02,818 --> 01:37:03,860
I'll try it, you know,

1194
01:37:03,944 --> 01:37:05,821
but I'm not sure my wife will let me do it.

1195
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,615
Maybe my next wife.

1196
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:14,079
You gotta see our next guest for yourself.

1197
01:37:14,246 --> 01:37:16,289
I'm pretty sure this guy could use a doctor.

1198
01:37:16,623 --> 01:37:17,624
Oh!

1199
01:37:17,708 --> 01:37:19,084
Does he have sexual problems?

1200
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:21,670
Oh, he looks like he's got a lot of problems.

1201
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:25,507
All right, Bobby, let's show that clip one last time.

1202
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:34,808
I hated school as a kid.

1203
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:38,770
But my mother would always say,

1204
01:37:39,813 --> 01:37:41,064
"You should enjoy it.

1205
01:37:41,148 --> 01:37:44,276
One day, you'll have to work for a living."

1206
01:37:44,443 --> 01:37:45,610
"No, I won't, Ma.

1207
01:37:45,694 --> 01:37:47,654
I'm gonna be a comedian."

1208
01:37:53,952 --> 01:37:56,246
Okay. You may...

1209
01:37:57,706 --> 01:38:00,959
You may have seen that clip of our next guest.

1210
01:38:01,126 --> 01:38:03,503
Now, before he comes out, I just want to say

1211
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:05,172
that we're all heartbroken

1212
01:38:05,255 --> 01:38:07,215
about what's going on in the city tonight.

1213
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:09,676
But this is how he wanted to come out,

1214
01:38:09,843 --> 01:38:13,055
and honestly, I think we could all use a good laugh.

1215
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:15,390
So, please welcome, Joker.

1216
01:38:58,016 --> 01:38:59,392
Are you all right, Doctor?

1217
01:39:03,230 --> 01:39:05,690
Well, that was quite an entrance.

1218
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:13,240
You okay?

1219
01:39:16,076 --> 01:39:17,494
Yeah.

1220
01:39:17,661 --> 01:39:20,372
This is exactly how I imagined it.

1221
01:39:22,332 --> 01:39:24,126
Well, that makes one of us.

1222
01:39:31,007 --> 01:39:33,176
So, can you tell us about this look?

1223
01:39:33,343 --> 01:39:34,678
When we spoke earlier,

1224
01:39:34,761 --> 01:39:36,721
you mentioned that this look is not a political statement.

1225
01:39:36,888 --> 01:39:37,931
Is that right?

1226
01:39:38,098 --> 01:39:39,724
That's right, Murray. I'm not political.

1227
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:42,435
I'm just trying to make people laugh.

1228
01:39:42,602 --> 01:39:44,604
And how's that going for you?

1229
01:39:52,696 --> 01:39:54,531
So, I know you're a comedian.

1230
01:39:54,698 --> 01:39:56,533
You been working on any new material?

1231
01:39:56,616 --> 01:39:57,742
You wanna tell us a joke?

1232
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,457
Yeah?

1233
01:40:06,626 --> 01:40:07,627
Okay.

1234
01:40:13,675 --> 01:40:15,302
He's got a book.

1235
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:17,679
A book of jokes.

1236
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:28,899
Take your time. We got all night.

1237
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:37,240
Okay, okay. Here's one.

1238
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:42,871
Knock, knock.

1239
01:40:43,038 --> 01:40:44,372
And you had to look that up?

1240
01:40:51,504 --> 01:40:53,131
I want to get it right.

1241
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:56,509
Knock, knock.

1242
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:58,178
Who's there?

1243
01:40:59,638 --> 01:41:01,056
It's the police, ma'am.

1244
01:41:01,223 --> 01:41:03,058
Your son's been hit by a drunk driver.

1245
01:41:03,225 --> 01:41:05,644
He's dead.

1246
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:09,147
Oh, no, no, no.

1247
01:41:09,314 --> 01:41:11,066
No, you cannot joke about that.

1248
01:41:11,233 --> 01:41:13,193
Yeah, that's not funny, Arthur.

1249
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,820
That's not the kind of humor we do on this show.

1250
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:18,698
Okay. I'm... Yeah, I'm sorry.

1251
01:41:18,865 --> 01:41:23,245
It's just, you know, it's been a rough few weeks, Murray.

1252
01:41:24,829 --> 01:41:26,665
Ever since

1253
01:41:29,209 --> 01:41:31,336
I killed those three Wall Street guys.

1254
01:41:37,926 --> 01:41:39,886
Okay, I'm waiting for the punchline.

1255
01:41:41,388 --> 01:41:43,098
There is no punchline.

1256
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:46,393
It's not a joke.

1257
01:41:51,064 --> 01:41:52,148
You're serious, aren't you?

1258
01:41:52,315 --> 01:41:53,316
You're telling us you killed

1259
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:54,526
those three young men on the subway?

1260
01:41:54,693 --> 01:41:55,694
Mmm-hmm.

1261
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,570
And why should we believe you?

1262
01:41:57,737 --> 01:41:59,698
I got nothing left to lose.

1263
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:03,743
Nothing can hurt me anymore.

1264
01:42:06,913 --> 01:42:09,791
My life is nothing but a comedy.

1265
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:14,462
Well, let me get this straight,

1266
01:42:14,546 --> 01:42:16,798
you think that killing those guys is funny?

1267
01:42:17,465 --> 01:42:18,967
I do.

1268
01:42:19,134 --> 01:42:21,761
And I'm tired of pretending it's not.

1269
01:42:21,928 --> 01:42:23,805
Comedy is subjective, Murray.

1270
01:42:24,264 --> 01:42:25,974
Isn't that what they say?

1271
01:42:26,141 --> 01:42:27,892
All of you,

1272
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:30,645
the system that knows so much,

1273
01:42:30,812 --> 01:42:33,523
you decide what's right or wrong.

1274
01:42:33,690 --> 01:42:38,903
The same way that you decide what's funny or not!

1275
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:41,239
Get him off!

1276
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:45,660
Well, okay, I think I might understand

1277
01:42:45,994 --> 01:42:47,495
that you did this to start a movement,

1278
01:42:47,579 --> 01:42:49,581
to become a symbol?

1279
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:51,750
Come on, Murray.

1280
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:53,084
Do I look like the kind of clown

1281
01:42:53,168 --> 01:42:54,753
that could start a movement?

1282
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:57,756
I killed those guys because they were awful.

1283
01:42:57,922 --> 01:43:00,425
Everybody is awful these days.

1284
01:43:00,592 --> 01:43:02,886
It's enough to make anyone crazy.

1285
01:43:03,053 --> 01:43:04,804
Okay. So, that's it, you're crazy.

1286
01:43:04,971 --> 01:43:07,265
That's your defense for killing three young men?

1287
01:43:07,891 --> 01:43:09,434
No.

1288
01:43:09,601 --> 01:43:12,937
They couldn't carry a tune to save their lives.

1289
01:43:14,773 --> 01:43:18,193
Oh, why is everybody so upset about these guys?

1290
01:43:19,069 --> 01:43:20,820
If it was me dying on the sidewalk,

1291
01:43:20,904 --> 01:43:22,280
you'd walk right over me!

1292
01:43:22,447 --> 01:43:24,574
I pass you every day, and you don't notice me.

1293
01:43:24,741 --> 01:43:26,993
But these guys, what, because Thomas Wayne

1294
01:43:27,077 --> 01:43:28,620
went and cried about them on TV?

1295
01:43:28,787 --> 01:43:30,830
You have a problem with Thomas Wayne, too?

1296
01:43:30,997 --> 01:43:32,916
Yes, I do.

1297
01:43:33,083 --> 01:43:36,503
Have you seen what it's like out there, Murray?

1298
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:39,714
Do you ever actually leave the studio?

1299
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:43,718
Everybody just yells and screams at each other.

1300
01:43:43,885 --> 01:43:46,054
Nobody's civil anymore.

1301
01:43:46,221 --> 01:43:49,808
Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy.

1302
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:53,395
You think men like Thomas Wayne ever think

1303
01:43:53,478 --> 01:43:55,438
what it's like to be someone like me?

1304
01:43:55,605 --> 01:43:58,316
To be somebody but themselves? They don't.

1305
01:43:58,525 --> 01:44:00,652
They think that we'll just sit there

1306
01:44:00,735 --> 01:44:03,113
and take it, like good little boys!

1307
01:44:03,405 --> 01:44:05,490
That we won't werewolf and go wild!

1308
01:44:05,657 --> 01:44:07,283
You finished?

1309
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:09,786
I mean, it's so much self-pity, Arthur.

1310
01:44:09,953 --> 01:44:11,496
You sound like you're making excuses

1311
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:12,997
for killing those young men.

1312
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:14,999
Not everybody, and I'll tell you this,

1313
01:44:15,083 --> 01:44:16,501
not everyone is awful.

1314
01:44:18,795 --> 01:44:20,004
You're awful, Murray.

1315
01:44:20,171 --> 01:44:22,048
Me? I'm awful?

1316
01:44:22,215 --> 01:44:23,967
Oh, yeah, how am I awful?

1317
01:44:26,136 --> 01:44:27,595
Playing my video.

1318
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:30,890
Inviting me on this show.

1319
01:44:31,975 --> 01:44:34,310
You just wanted to make fun of me.

1320
01:44:35,311 --> 01:44:37,272
You're just like the rest of them.

1321
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:39,357
You don't know the first thing about me, pal.

1322
01:44:39,524 --> 01:44:42,110
Look what happened, because of what you did. What it led to.

1323
01:44:42,277 --> 01:44:43,987
There are riots out there.

1324
01:44:44,154 --> 01:44:45,613
Two policemen are in critical condition,

1325
01:44:45,697 --> 01:44:46,823
and you're laughing.

1326
01:44:46,990 --> 01:44:47,991
You're laughing.

1327
01:44:48,158 --> 01:44:50,994
Someone was killed today, because of what you did.

1328
01:44:51,161 --> 01:44:52,620
I know.

1329
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:56,416
How about another joke, Murray?

1330
01:44:56,583 --> 01:44:58,209
No, I think we've had enough of your jokes.

1331
01:44:58,376 --> 01:44:59,586
- What do you get... - I don't think so.

1332
01:44:59,752 --> 01:45:02,297
...when you cross a mentally-ill loner

1333
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:04,883
with a society that abandons him

1334
01:45:04,966 --> 01:45:06,009
and treats him like trash?

1335
01:45:06,176 --> 01:45:07,177
Call the police, Gene!

1336
01:45:07,343 --> 01:45:08,636
- I'll tell you what you get! - Call the police.

1337
01:45:08,803 --> 01:45:10,472
You get what you fucking deserve!

1338
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:50,136
Good night. And always remember, that's...

1339
01:45:55,517 --> 01:45:56,768
Breaking news.

1340
01:45:56,935 --> 01:45:59,479
Popular TV talk show host, Murray Franklin

1341
01:45:59,646 --> 01:46:01,773
was shot dead tonight on the live telecast of his program.

1342
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:04,234
The man who was introduced by Franklin

1343
01:46:04,317 --> 01:46:07,195
as "Joker" is currently under arrest.

1344
01:46:07,362 --> 01:46:09,948
Police led the suspect handcuffed out of the studio.

1345
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:14,244
...merely just a punchline to a joke...

1346
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:15,995
You get what you deserve!

1347
01:46:16,162 --> 01:46:17,205
Looting and rioting

1348
01:46:17,288 --> 01:46:18,331
have intensified here...

1349
01:46:18,498 --> 01:46:19,832
...rioting throughout the city.

1350
01:46:19,999 --> 01:46:21,251
...with a society that abandons him

1351
01:46:21,334 --> 01:46:22,377
and treats him like trash?

1352
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:23,670
This mob of clowns...

1353
01:46:23,753 --> 01:46:25,213
...many wearing clown masks.

1354
01:46:27,215 --> 01:46:28,883
If it was me dying on the sidewalk,

1355
01:46:28,967 --> 01:46:30,301
- you'd walk right over me. - To all of

1356
01:46:30,385 --> 01:46:31,803
those who have been ignored by the system.

1357
01:46:31,886 --> 01:46:33,012
And always remember, that's life!

1358
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:35,848
And as you see, Gotham is burning.

1359
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:41,479
In the white room With black curtains near the station

1360
01:46:44,983 --> 01:46:49,946
Black roof country, no gold pavements Tired starlings

1361
01:46:53,825 --> 01:46:56,661
Silver horses ran down moonbeams

1362
01:46:58,788 --> 01:47:00,832
In your dark eyes

1363
01:47:02,834 --> 01:47:08,923
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving My contentment

1364
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:18,224
I'll wait in this place Where the sun never shines

1365
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:24,230
Wait in this place

1366
01:47:24,314 --> 01:47:29,861
Where the shadows run from themselves

1367
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:33,072
Stop laughing, you freak! This isn't funny.

1368
01:47:33,698 --> 01:47:34,949
Yeah, the whole fucking city's on fire

1369
01:47:35,033 --> 01:47:36,034
'cause of what you did.

1370
01:47:37,243 --> 01:47:39,537
All units, fire reported, north of alley.

1371
01:47:39,621 --> 01:47:41,164
Code Four for medical.

1372
01:47:41,789 --> 01:47:43,249
I know.

1373
01:47:44,751 --> 01:47:46,753
Isn't it beautiful?

1374
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:30,565
Go over there.

1375
01:49:48,458 --> 01:49:49,584
Hey, Wayne.

1376
01:49:50,543 --> 01:49:52,295
You get what you fucking deserve.

1377
01:49:52,462 --> 01:49:53,588
No! Pal!

1378
01:50:34,378 --> 01:50:36,380
Come on, get up!

1379
01:50:36,547 --> 01:50:38,508
Come on, man, get up.

1380
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:19,794
What's so funny?

1381
01:53:23,798 --> 01:53:25,383
Just thinking of a joke.

1382
01:53:44,568 --> 01:53:46,570
Do you want to tell it to me?

1383
01:53:52,743 --> 01:53:54,370
You wouldn't get it.

1384
01:54:06,424 --> 01:54:08,092
That's life

1385
01:54:08,175 --> 01:54:09,635
That's life

1386
01:54:09,719 --> 01:54:12,638
And as funny as it may seem

1387
01:54:14,098 --> 01:54:16,809
Some people get their kicks

1388
01:54:16,976 --> 01:54:19,103
Stompin' on a dream

1389
01:54:20,146 --> 01:54:23,816
But I don't let it, let it get me down

1390
01:54:25,985 --> 01:54:28,154
'Cause this fine old world

1391
01:54:28,279 --> 01:54:30,865
It keeps spinnin' around

1392
01:54:31,615 --> 01:54:34,910
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate

1393
01:54:34,994 --> 01:54:38,247
A poet, a pawn and a king

1394
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:42,293
I've been up and down and over and out

1395
01:54:42,376 --> 01:54:44,545
And I know one thing

1396
01:54:44,879 --> 01:54:50,718
Each time I find myself flat on my face

1397
01:54:51,135 --> 01:54:57,183
I pick myself up And get back in the race

1398
01:54:57,558 --> 01:54:58,768
That's life

1399
01:54:58,851 --> 01:54:59,935
That's life

1400
01:55:00,019 --> 01:55:04,065
That's life And I can't deny it

1401
01:55:04,774 --> 01:55:10,029
Many times I thought of cuttin' out But my heart won't buy it

1402
01:55:10,613 --> 01:55:15,201
But if there's nothing shakin' Come here this July

1403
01:55:18,162 --> 01:55:24,335
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball

1404
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:31,050
And die

1405
01:55:32,843 --> 01:55:38,682
My, my

1406
01:55:50,069 --> 01:55:52,571
Isn't it rich?

1407
01:55:54,907 --> 01:55:57,701
Are we a pair?

1408
01:55:59,745 --> 01:56:03,541
Me here at last on the ground

1409
01:56:03,791 --> 01:56:07,044
You in mid-air

1410
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:13,717
Send in the clowns

1411
01:56:20,516 --> 01:56:23,060
Isn't it bliss?

1412
01:56:25,938 --> 01:56:29,275
Don't you approve?

1413
01:56:30,943 --> 01:56:34,613
One who keeps tearing around

1414
01:56:34,697 --> 01:56:38,868
One who can't move

1415
01:56:41,829 --> 01:56:47,042
Where are the clowns?

1416
01:56:48,335 --> 01:56:52,173
Send in the clowns

1417
01:56:53,132 --> 01:56:55,885
Just when I stopped

1418
01:56:57,386 --> 01:57:00,556
Opening doors

1419
01:57:02,308 --> 01:57:08,981
Finally knowing The one that I wanted was yours

1420
01:57:11,108 --> 01:57:17,781
Making my entrance again With my usual flair

1421
01:57:21,035 --> 01:57:25,998
Sure of my lines

1422
01:57:27,750 --> 01:57:32,713
No one is there

1423
01:57:40,095 --> 01:57:44,099
Don't you love farce?

1424
01:57:46,894 --> 01:57:49,939
My fault, I fear

1425
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:56,445
I thought that you'd want what I want

1426
01:57:56,528 --> 01:58:00,199
Sorry, my dear

1427
01:58:02,493 --> 01:58:07,164
But where are the clowns?

1428
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:14,463
There ought to be clowns

1429
01:58:15,631 --> 01:58:22,596
Well, maybe next year
