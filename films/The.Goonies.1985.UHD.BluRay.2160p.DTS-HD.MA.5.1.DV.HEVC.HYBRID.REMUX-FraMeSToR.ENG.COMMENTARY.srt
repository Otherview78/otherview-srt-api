- That was the background?

- You got it.

302

One hour and I'll be back.
Bye, baby. Rosie?

303
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,543
- Bye, Mrs. Walsh.
- Bye.

COMMENTARY:
I hate the way I said that "bye."

305
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,592
Anybody caught that?
I'm really strange at that.

306
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,091
I don't know what I was thinking.

307
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,802
I apologize to everyone
in the DVD community.

308
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,304
- That was on purpose.
- Yeah.

309
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,849
- I love that shirt.
- Oh, here comes the bondage scene.

310
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,226
Cindy Lauper video.

311
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,061
- Oh, bondage.
- Oh, really, is it?

312
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,604
- Oh, yeah.
- Bondage is coming.

313
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,771
- Oh, that's right.
- Oh, no, no. That comes later.

314
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:38,235
- The bondage around the chair?
- Yeah, the bondage around the chair.

315
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,403
Oh, right.

316
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,113
- Is that here or later?
- Oh, bondage.

317
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,907
- No, it's later.
- No, I think it's pretty close.

318
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,117
Because you have to--

319
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,123
- We go up to go the attic first.
- You gotta the attic and then-- Yeah.

320
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,371
And you really--

321
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,748
- This attic scene was two days?
- A hundred--

322
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,750
- About stage 20, right?
- Yes, stage 20.

323
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,597
- Hundred and something takes.
- Steadicam.

324
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,952
- Are you serious?
- Steadicam.

325
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,255
- It wasn't that--
- It was.

326
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,590
- I swear to God, it was two days of takes.
- Remember?

327
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,592
- I thought it was like 38.
- No, no, no.

328
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,999
- I always remember that.
- Dick, you're a monster there.

329
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,388
Of this particular shot?

330
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,931
Well, after 38, they sent me home.

331
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,225
- Was it this shot? Is it this shot?
- I don't know.

332
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,686
- It's the long one with the picture.
- It's the long one.

333
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,272
- Yeah.
- I stick my tongue through the thing.

334
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:16,481
- Yeah.
- That one.

335
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,128
- My Lord.
- We did that for two days.

336
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,110
God, I'm so glad
we weren't in that scene.

337
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,571
Hey, this is it.
This is the start of the Steadicam shot.

- Oh, yeah, right.

- Check out the subtext there.
- Light bulb over Mouth's head.

346
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,020
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, look at that tongue.

347
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:48,513
Hey, you paid a lot of money
for that tongue in that face.

348
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,644
MIKEY: I gotcha! Get out from there,
you're ruining the painting!

349
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,689
You're ruining my joke.
The painting's already cracked.

COMMENTARY:
Ah, right.

352
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,990
- Look at that. Look at that acting there.
- Nice stuff.

353
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,326
Were you gonna do One-Eyed Willy here?

354
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,036
- No.
- Yeah, the map.

355
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:12,370
We find the map now.

356
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:14,508
- The Chester Copperpot.
- He drops the map.

357
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,958
- Yeah.
- He kicks it. Somebody kicks it over.

358
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,095
It's not the map,
it's the Chester Copperpot.

359
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,923
Yeah, and then it gets revealed,
doesn't it?

360
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,133
Don't we have your first big speech
coming up here?

361
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,843
- Who's?
- Sean Astin's.

362
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,804
Sean-- Oh, right, gang. That's right.

363
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,681
And I remember that was about 550 takes
on that one.

364
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,183
No, I'm just--

365
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,518
No, you're right.

366
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:39,898
I remember when we filmed the scene
where I'm sitting down and talking about...

367
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:42,109
- ...this pirates--
- Try and get this out of you.

368
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,028
You had the same problem
with your lines then.

369
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:48,323
- No, they did about 300 angles on it.
- No, no, no.

370
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,868
If I'm not mistaken, it was originally
a speech written for the Fratelli brothers.

371
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,755
You wanted it to come out of my mouth
so I didn't have it to prepare.

372
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,833
I don't think I wanted it.
I think you wanted it.

373
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,708
You decided--
Fellini over here decided--

374
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,878
Fellini over here says--

375
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,006
Decides he's gonna go
for an innovative film technique...

376
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:09,386
...and he's gonna show
how the young child actor mind works.

377
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:13,390
And he tells me the story. He sets me down,
he says, "I'm gonna tell you a story...

378
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,725
...and all I want you to do
is listen to the story...

379
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,062
...and then we're gonna film it
and I want you to tell me the story back."

380
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,232
And all I thought was, "That's genius,"
and I couldn't-- I kept--

381
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,401
- And that was it.
- See? Here we go again.

382
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:25,968
- That was it.
- Started stuttering.

383
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,406
- But then you-- I remember that we--
- We find the map.

384
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,616
It was hot and I was trying to remember
the story...

385
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,535
...and I was trying
to make you happy and--

386
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,205
And I was pissed off because Wardrobe
won't let me keep that jacket.

387
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,012
And you can still have it if you want it.

388
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,711
But I remembered, Dick,
that you wanted to--

389
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:46,158
- It was clear that I was messing up.
- You're catching flies because you're tough.

390
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,508
- It was clear that I--
- That was another Stanislavsky.

391
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,260
Did you actually deliver--?

392
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,227
- What were you grabbing?
- I don't know, man.

393
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,785
- I never figured that out.
- I never figured that out either.

394
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,268
- No, I was seeing things, nervous.
- The direction you gave us the most--

395
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,605
The one direction we got the most--

396
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,106
- Was what?
- What?

397
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,358
- "Big eyes."
- Big eyes! That's right.

398
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,568
- Big eyes.
- Big eyes.

399
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:07,855
- Lookit.
- I don't remember.

400
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,280
- Look at the big eyes.
- Look at those eyes.

401
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,115
- Big eyes.
- Big eyes.

402
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,367
- Yeah.
- There's blatant big eyes coming up.

403
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,174
I remember, you decided at a certain point
that it was going badly.

404
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,914
And you said,
"Let's just take a break."

405
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,124
"Let's take a break."
You wanted me to step outside.

406
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,460
We're gonna have some clean air
outside of stage 20.

407
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,712
It was nighttime, it was a little bit later.

408
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,131
Don't know if were getting close
till they cutoff time...

409
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,898
...when we had to go home or whatever.
But all I kept thinking is:

410
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:34,346
"Is this supposed to make me relax?
Everybody is standing there, waiting for me.

411
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,139
Oh, my God."

412
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,100
- Big eyes, kids.
- Here it is.

413
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,144
- I'm so cute.
- Look how cute you were.

414
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,604
I'm so cute.

415
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,481
I don't remember him saying that.

416
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,942
And we first looked at the ship, "Big eyes."

417
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,069
All we all said was, "Holy shit,"
so they cut.

418
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,154
- Big eyes.
- Look at big eyes.

419
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:52,656
Big eyes.

420
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,325
- Now they're gonna have to cut that.
- Big eyes on that thing.

421
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,620
All I remember
is Ke kept looking at my nose.

422
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,705
Did you have that--?

423
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,333
It's the-- The little dirt smudge
on your nose.

424
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,502
I'm thinking,
"Why's he looking at my nose?"

425
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,003
Because you had a big brown spot.

426
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,589
Yeah, there was a booger hanging out.

427
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,301
He was trying to help you out.
He was trying to tell you.

428
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,679
BRAND:
You sound as corny as Dad does.

429
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,807
- My dad tells the truth. Know what he said?
- What?

430
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:22,936
He said One-Eyed Willy and his bunch
were down there for years.

431
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,189
- They were digging tunnels and caves.
- Wow.

432
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,316
- Setting booty traps.
- Booby traps.

433
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,194
Setting booby traps so anybody
who tried to get in...

COMMENTARY:
Booby traps.

435
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,614
- That was another big word.
- That was ours, right?

436
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:35,949
Booby traps.

437
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,867
MIKEY:
So they wouldn't get his treasure.

438
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,786
Wait a minute.

439
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:44,541
- COMMENTARY: "Wait a minute, Mikey."
- Yeah, "Wait a minute, Mikey."

440
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,210
Yeah, "Wait a minute, Mikey."

441
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,379
- Now that's method acting, Dick. Come on.
- Yeah.

442
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,880
I gotta get some credit for that.

443
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,716
- Well, here's the wire.
- Wait. Hold on.

444
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,884
Watch this.
Those hands are not my hands.

445
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,891
Look at those hands.
A 45-year-old man's hands.

446
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,014
- Yes.
- That's right.

447

this day, Josh. I remember.

...so that we were able to drop
from the floor.

- ...the Jackson Five concert?
- The Victory Tour.

So, for some reason,
Michael Jackson gave Corey his glasses.

And Corey, like, held these glasses
like they were the hammer of Thor.

This was actually one
of my scariest moments as an actor...
