1
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,958
How you doing, Keaton?

2
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:32,292
I can't feel my legs,

3
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,250
keyser.

4
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:41,750
Ready?

5
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:54,833
What time is it?

6
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,292
12:30.

7
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,667
It all started back in New York
six weeks ago.

8
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,458
A truck loaded with stripped gun parts
got jacked outside of queens.

9
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,833
The driver didn't see anybody,
but somebody fucked up.

10
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,625
He heard a voice.
Sometimes that's all you need.

11
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,542
- Mr. McManus?
- Christ!

12
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,583
Don't you fucking guys ever sleep?

13
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,292
- We have a warrant for your arrest.
- Fuck you, pig.

14
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,250
Todd hockney?

15
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:38,792
- Who wants to know?
- New York police department.

16
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:45,125
- Shit.
- Freeze!

17
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:46,625
Hold it!

18
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,417
Sure you brought enough guys?

19
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,208
It's quite simple, really.

20
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:35,125
A restaurant that changes with the taste
without losing the overall aesthetic.

21
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:36,500
In other words,

22
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:39,750
the atmosphere will not be
painted on the walls.

23
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:44,833
- Well, let me give you an example.
- This I had to see for myself.

24
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
David.

25
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,958
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

26
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,625
Everyone, this is David kujan.

27
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:58,250
Special agent kujan, us customs.

28
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:01,417
These gentlemen are
from the New York police department.

29
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,417
You look good, Keaton.
Better than I would have thought.

30
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,417
A small matter of a stolen truck
loaded with guns.

31
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,417
Mr. Keaton?

32
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,000
Will you excuse us for a moment?

33
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,013
We have some questions
to ask you downtown.

34
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:22,042
You're gonna be a while.

35
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,417
No, no, no. Please, please, please.
Sit down.

36
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,583
This is... this is a small problem.

37
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,875
Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.

38
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:58,125
It didn't make sense that I'd be there.

39
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:00,292
I mean, these guys were
hard-core hijackers,

40
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,042
but there I was.

41
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,458
At that point, I wasn't scared.

42
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,042
I knew I hadn't done anything
they could do me for.

43
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,292
Besides, it was fun.

44
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,500
[Got to make like I was notorious.

45
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,708
All right, you all know the drill.

46
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,955
When your number is called,

47
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,250
step forward and repeat the phrase
you've been given. Understand?

48
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,917
Number one, step forward.

49
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:32,875
"Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker."

50
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:37,250
Number two, step forward.

51
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,667
Give me the fucking keys,
you fucking cocksucker, motherfucker!

52
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:47,125
Knock it off! Get back!
Number three, step forward.

53
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,583
- "Hand me the keys, you cocksucker."
- In English, please.

54
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,958
- Excuse me?
- In English.

55
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:06,500
Hand me the fucking keys, you cocksucker.
What the fuck?

56
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:08,917
Number four, step forward.

57
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,917
It was bullshit.
The whole rap was a setup.

58
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,958
"Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker."

59
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:16,917
It was all the cops' fault.

60
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,018
You don't put guys like that
into a room together.

61
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:20,208
Number five, step forward.

62
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,875
Who knows what can happen?

63
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:25,875
"Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker."

64
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,708
This has really got to be
embarrassing for you guys, huh?

65
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,292
They drilled us all night.

66
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,476
Somebody was pissed
about that truck getting hijacked

67
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,625
and the cops had nothing.

68
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:36,312
They were hoping
somebody would slip up

69
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,958
and give them something to go on.

70
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,792
They knew we wouldn't fight it
because they knew how to lean on us.

71
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,167
They've been doing it forever.

72
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,059
I mean, our rights
went right out the window.

73
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,083
It was a violation. I mean, disgraceful.

74
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,083
They went after McManus first.
Top-notch entry man.

75
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,625
What truck?

76
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,125
- The truck with the guns, fucko.
- "Fucko?"

77
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:59,500
He was a good guy. Crazy, though.

78
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,587
You wanna know
what your buddy, fenster, told us?

79
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,583
- Say who?
- McManus.

80
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,417
He told us another story altogether.

81
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:09,167
0h, is that the one
about the hooker with dysentery?

82
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,333
Fenster always worked with McManus.
He was a real tight-ass,

83
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,417
but when it came to the job,
he was right on. A smart man.

84
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,417
- What are you saying?
- I said he'll flip you.

85
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,458
- He'll what?
- Flip you. Flip you for real.

86
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,917
- Yeah, I'm shaking. Come on.
- 0kay.

87
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,208
- Answer my question.
- Can you hear me in the back?

88
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,208
Hello?

89
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,000
I want my lawyer.

90
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,208
I'm gonna have your fucking badge,
cocksucken

91
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,083
Todd hockney, good with explosives.

92
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:40,875
Without a doubt, the one guy
who didn't give a fuck about anybody.

93
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:43,500
You guys don't have
a fucking leg to stand on.

94
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:45,125
You think so, tough guy?

95
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:47,583
I can put you in queens
on the night of the hijacking.

96
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,958
Really?

97
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,417
I live in queens.

98
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:53,083
Did you put that together
yourself, Einstein?

99
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,810
What, you got a team of monkeys
working around the clock on this?

100
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:58,417
You know what happens
if you do another turn in the joint?

101
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,208
Fuck your father in the shower
and then have a snack.

102
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,625
- Are you gonna charge me, dickhead?
- I'll charge you when I'm ready.

103
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,333
- With what?
- You know damn well, dead man.

104
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
But Keaton?

105
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,375
Keaton was the real prize for them,
for obvious reasons.

106
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,958
It was your mistake, not mine.

107
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,583
Did you ever stop to ask me?

108
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:26,583
I mean, I've been walking around
with the same face, the same name.

109
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,292
I'm a businessman.

110
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,542
Yeah, what's that?
The restaurant business?

111
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,500
No. From now on, you're in
the getting-fucked-by-us business.

112
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.

113
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,583
Like I said,

114
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,875
it was your mistake,

115
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,792
not mine.

116
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,500
Now, you charge me with this shit

117
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,875
and I'll beat it.

118
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,625
Okay?

119
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

120
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,934
All right, really, really, really,

121
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,434
somebody gotta do something
about this shit,

122
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,375
getting hauled in every five minutes.

123
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:03,167
So I did a little time.

124
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:07,708
Does that mean I get railed every time
a truck finds its way off the planet?

125
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,125
Fuck 'em.

126
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,542
Fenster, will you relax?

127
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,625
These guys don't have
any probable cause.

128
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:15,917
You're fucking-a right. No PC.

129
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,125
Not goddamn right.
You do some time, never let you go.

130
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,250
You know, they treat me like a criminal,

131
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,125
- I'll end up a criminal.
- You are a criminal.

132
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,208
Now, why'd you got to go and do that?

133
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,417
- Trying to make a point.
- Well, why don't you make your point?

134
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,958
You're making me tired all over.

135
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,667
0h, fuck it, then.

136
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:39,042
- I heard you were dead.
- 0h, yeah?

137
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:40,708
Well, you heard right.

138
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,625
Word I got is you
hung up your spurs, man.

139
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:45,417
- What's that all about?
- What's this?

140
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:50,875
Rumor has it Keaton's gone straight.
I hear he's tapping Edie finneran.

141
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:52,125
Who is that?

142
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:54,750
She's a heavyweight criminal lawyer
from uptown.

143
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:56,542
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

144
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,417
How about it, Keaton?

145
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:00,750
You a lawyer's wife?

146
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,333
What kind of retainer you giving her?

147
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,833
Whoops!

148
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,375
Hey, fenster, do your friend a favor.

149
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:11,083
Tell him to keep quiet.

150
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,000
Dean Keaton.

151
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,000
Gone clean, huh?

152
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,167
Say it ain't so.

153
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,625
- Or was it you that hit that truck?
- Mac, Mac, forget him.

154
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,358
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

155
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,833
This whole thing was a shakedown.

156
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,125
- What makes you say that?
- How many times you been in a lineup?

157
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:34,625
It's always you and four dummies.

158
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:38,125
The pd are paying homeless guys
10 bucks a head, half the time.

159
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,125
And there's no way
they'd line five felons in the same row.

160
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:43,750
No way. And what's a voice lineup?

161
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:45,768
A public defender
could get you out of that one.

162
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,833
- So, why the hell was I strip-searched?
- It was the feds.

163
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,417
A truckload of guns gets snagged,

164
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:54,417
customs comes down on top of NYPD
looking for answers.

165
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,042
They come up with us.
They're clutching at straws.

166
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,042
I had a guy's finger
up my asshole tonight.

167
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,458
Is it Friday already?

168
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,833
Yeah, lover boy.

169
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,542
You want a piece? Jump in. I'll love you.

170
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,125
So who in the goddamn piss hell
stole that fucking truck?

171
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:14,792
- What did you say?
- Who stole the fucking truck?

172
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,958
- I don't want to know.
- Who asked you, working man?

173
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,792
Fuck who did it.
What I want to know is, who's the gimp?

174
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,125
- He's okay.
- Says you. How do I know that?

175
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:25,125
What about it, pretzel man?
What's your story?

176
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:26,750
His name is verbal.

177
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,708
Verbal kint.

178
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,292
- Verbal?
- Yeah.

179
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,625
Roger, really. People say I talk too much.

180
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:35,708
Yeah, I was just going
to tell you to shut up.

181
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,417
- We met before, once or twice.
- In county. I was in for fraud.

182
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,792
You were in a lineup then, too.
What happened?

183
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,875
I walked. 90 days, suspended.

184
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:47,625
- So you did it.
- All right, now, look,

185
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,458
we've all been put out
by this whole thing, right?

186
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,583
So, I figure we owe it to ourselves
to salvage a little dignity.

187
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,667
Now, me and fenster
heard about a little job.

188
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,625
Why don't you just calm down?

189
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:03,958
What do you care what he has to say?

190
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:06,917
I'm just talking here

191
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,417
and it seems to me like Mr. Hockney
wants to hear what I got to say

192
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,583
and I know fenster's down.

193
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:14,625
What about you, guy?

194
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,792
I'm interested, sure.

195
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,208
There. See?

196
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,750
So now, I'd like to exercise my right
to free assembly.

197
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:25,708
Why don't you just shut up?

198
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,375
You're missing the point.

199
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:37,458
You're missing the point.

200
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,792
I don't want to hear anything from you.

201
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,333
I don't care about your job.

202
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:46,292
And

203
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,458
I want nothing to do with any of you.

204
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,625
I beg your pardon,
but you can all go to hell.

205
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,667
Dean Keaton gone the high road.

206
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,542
What is the world coming to?

207
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:10,792
Fuck him.

208
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,083
And that was how it started.

209
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,542
The five of us being brought in
on a trumped-up charge

210
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,417
to be leaned on by half-wits.

211
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,333
Okay, now, I really can't
talk about it much here.

212
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,000
What the cops never figured out,
and what I know now,

213
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:34,458
was that these men would never break,
never lie down,

214
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,458
never bend over for anybody.

215
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,667
Anybody.

216
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,917
- Who are you?
- Agent Jack baer, FBI.

217
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,042
- How many dead?
- 15, so far.

218
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,528
They're still pulling some bodies
out of the water, though.

219
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,000
- Any survivors?
- Yeah, there's two.

220
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,875
One guy's in county hospital,
but he's in a coma.

221
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:12,042
The da has a second guy,
a cripple from New York, I think.

222
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,500
Listen, the chief wants this place
sealed off.

223
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,667
If you have any questions,
give him a call.

224
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,958
This is Dave kujan.
I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.

225
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,167
If you need to reach me,
contact Jeff rabin

226
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,750
of the San Pedro police department
at extension 112.

227
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:02,583
Have a nice day.

228
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,417
- Why can't I see him?
- Dave, I told you,

229
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,375
the da came down here last night
ready to arraign,

230
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:13,667
even before they moved him
to county, okay?

231
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,958
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later,

232
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,208
the da comes out of the office looking
like the bogeyman smacked him around.

233
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,750
All right? They take a statement
and they cut him a deal.

234
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:26,958
- Did they charge him with anything?
- Yeah, weapons. Misdemeanor two.

235
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:28,333
What is that?

236
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,833
Listen, I give the da credit
for getting that much, you understand?

237
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,542
Excuse me, sir.

238
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,917
This whole thing has turned political.

239
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,625
The mayor was here last night, the chief.

240
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:43,000
This morning, the governor called, okay?

241
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,958
I'm telling you, this guy is protected

242
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,292
from up on high
by the prince of darkness.

243
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,792
- Take my word for it.
- Well, when does he post bail?

244
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,083
- Maybe two hours, tops.
- I want to see him.

245
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,010
- No, Dave.
- Well, I gotta see him, Jeffrey.

246
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,708
- Dave, no! I cannot...
- Listen, you gotta do this for me.

247
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,333
I came along way for this.

248
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,292
Dave, please.

249
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,792
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk to you.

250
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,708
He's paranoid about being recorded.

251
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,715
He knows the interrogation rooms
are all wired.

252
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,750
I quit.

253
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,675
This won't be an interrogation,
just a friendly chat to kill some time.

254
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,792
He will not go into
the interrogation room.

255
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,417
- Then some place else, then.
- Where?

256
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,608
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

257
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,625
If this was a dope deal, where's the dope?

258
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,292
If it was a hit, who called it in?

259
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,500
And I'm sure you have
a host of wild theories

260
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:31,867
to answer all these questions.

261
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,309
They know damn well what I think.

262
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,417
That's crazy, and, besides,
it doesn't even matter.

263
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,375
The guy's got total immunity.
His story checks out.

264
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:40,417
He doesn't know what you want to know.

265
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't think he does, not exactly.

266
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:45,250
But there's a lot more to his story,
believe me.

267
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:49,750
Jeffrey, look, I wanna know why
27 men died on that pier

268
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:54,292
for what looks to be $91 million
worth of dope that wasn't there.

269
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,875
And above all,
I want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead.

270
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,625
He's dead.

271
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:03,083
Come on. Two hours.
Just till he makes bail.

272
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,958
They're all dead.

273
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,205
I don't care how tough a guy
you say this Keaton was,

274
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:09,458
nobody on that boat
could've come out alive.

275
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,458
Is he talking?

276
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,476
He regained consciousness
less than an hour ago.

277
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,708
He spoke... not English, then he lapsed.

278
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:19,875
You think Hungarian?

279
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,809
I don't know.
I think that might've been what it was.

280
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,101
Yeah. Most of them were Hungarians.

281
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,518
Here, you gotta put on one of these.

282
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:26,382
Burn victims are very susceptible
to infection.

283
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,250
And, of course, there's no smoking.

284
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:42,458
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.

285
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,667
Is he gonna die?

286
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,625
He has burns over 60% of his body,
a number of his ribs were broken...

287
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:49,476
Call hospital security, get a man
put on the door till the police get here.

288
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,417
- Is he dangerous?
- Yes.

289
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,833
Do it.

290
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:54,792
Do it, now!

291
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,292
Joel? Yeah, baer. Down at la county.

292
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:04,375
Look, the guy they pulled
out of the harbor is arkosh kovash.

293
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:06,292
Yes. Yes, I'm sure.

294
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,500
Well, no, no, he's all fucked up.

295
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,958
I can't hear you.

296
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,667
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

297
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:16,583
Yes.

298
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,000
Well, no, no. Not till I put a man on him.

299
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:21,047
Listen, send me someone
who can speak Hungarian.

300
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,752
Yeah, he's awake.
He's talking like a Thai hooker.

301
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,958
Keyser soze.

302
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,250
- What?
- Keyser soze!

303
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:31,500
Keyser soze!

304
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,250
Keyser soze.

305
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:35,625
No shit?

306
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,083
Joel, come in. Yeah.
Call Dan metzheiser over at justice,

307
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,625
and find Dave kujan from customs.

308
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,417
Verbal, this is agent kujan from customs.

309
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,000
Nice to meet you.

310
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,625
He wants to ask you a few questions
before you go.

311
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:27,792
- What about?
- About a Dean Keaton, mostly.

312
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,875
But I'd like to start at the lineup
back in New York.

313
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:35,375
- Can I get some coffee?
- In a while. Let's talk about the lineup.

314
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:38,750
I'm really thirsty.
I used to dehydrate as a kid.

315
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:41,167
One time, I got so bad
my piss come out like snot.

316
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,768
I'm not kidding.
It was all thick and gooey...

317
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:44,292
I'll get your fucking coffee.

318
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,000
Get me one, too, while you're at it.

319
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:52,792
That guy is tense.

320
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,792
Tension is a killer.

321
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,958
I used to be in a barbershop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois.

322
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:00,750
The baritone was this guy
named kip diskin, big fat guy.

323
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:02,125
I mean, like, orca fat.

324
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:03,851
He was so stressed in the morning,
you know.

325
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,583
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.

326
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,750
Sure, and I appreciate that.

327
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,958
And I wanna help you, agent kujan.
I like cops.

328
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,708
I would've liked to have been
a fed myself, but my gp always...

329
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:17,792
Verbal, you're not telling us everything.
I know you know something.

330
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,958
I told the da everything I know.

331
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,792
Verbal, I know you like Keaton.

332
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:28,375
- I know you think he's a good man.
- I know he was good.

333
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:29,875
He was a corrupt cop.

334
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,958
Sure, 15 years ago,
but he was a good thief.

335
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,375
Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him
go legit.

336
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,667
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

337
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,458
Are you trying to get a rise out of me,
agent kujan?

338
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:47,375
- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.

339
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:49,458
May I have a cigarette?

340
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,210
- According to your statement...
- I need a light.

341
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,042
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator,

342
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,292
run-of-the-mill...

343
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,250
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator,

344
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,417
run-of-the-mill scams.

345
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,083
That's been suppressed.
Anything in there is inadmissible.

346
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,667
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.

347
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:24,667
Well, I do have the weapons charge.

348
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,125
I'm looking at
six whole months' hard time.

349
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:29,375
You know a dealer
named Ruby deemer, verbal?

350
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:32,958
You know a religious guy
named John Paul?

351
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,958
- You know Ruby's in attica?
- He didn't have my lawyer.

352
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,958
I know Ruby. He's big on respect.

353
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,000
He's a good friend of mine,
likes me very much.

354
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:43,542
Now, I know your testimony is sealed.
Ruby's well-connected.

355
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:46,292
He's got lots of friends inside,
do a lot of favors for him.

356
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:47,792
What do you think he would say

357
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:50,292
if he found out
you dropped his name to the da?

358
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:54,000
- There's nothing in there about Ruby.
- I'll be sure to mention that to him.

359
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,934
First thing on the job,
you know what I learned?

360
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:57,125
How to spot a murderer.

361
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:59,583
Let's say you arrest three guys
for the same killing.

362
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,150
You put them all in jail overnight.

363
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,212
The next morning,
whoever's sleeping is your man.

364
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,101
You see, if you're guilty,
you know you're caught.

365
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,250
You get some rest.
You let your guard down.

366
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:09,292
- You follow me?
- No.

367
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,208
Let me get right to the point.

368
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,458
I'm smarter than you

369
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:17,250
and I'm gonna find out what I wanna know

370
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,708
and I'm gonna get it from you,
whether you like it or not.

371
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:22,417
I'm not a rat.

372
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:29,958
Thanks.

373
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,292
Back when I was picking beans
in Guatemala,

374
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:37,958
we used to make fresh coffee.

375
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:41,000
Right off the trees,
I mean. That was good.

376
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,500
This is shit,
but, hey, I'm in a police station.

377
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,042
Can we get started again?

378
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,458
Now, what happened after the lineup?

379
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,268
The desk sergeant
was actually trying to tell me

380
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:56,452
that he couldn't release you.

381
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,458
I mean, can you believe that?
You weren't even charged.

382
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,000
Damn police.

383
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:05,958
You know, iwanna have
pictures taken of your face.

384
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:08,268
I'll take them to the da's office
first thing in the morning.

385
00:26:08,292 --> 00:26:10,083
- Forget about it.
- Absolutely not!

386
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,059
I'm gonna have this thing
in front of a grand jury by Monday.

387
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:14,208
Look, I don't want
to talk about it, Edie, okay?

388
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,958
So, what did fortier and Renault say?

389
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:21,875
They asked for some more time
to think about investing.

390
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,625
- Damn it.
- More time. It's okay.

391
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,125
More time for what, Edie?

392
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,917
No matter how you cover my tracks,
they're still gonna find out about me.

393
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,042
Give me some credit.

394
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:33,542
I got you this far.
Let's go to the grand jury.

395
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,393
You know, this isn't gonna stop
if we don't...

396
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:37,542
It's never going to stop, period.

397
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,083
By next week, every investor in the city
is gonna be walking away from us.

398
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:45,708
It's finished.

399
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:47,333
I'm finished.

400
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:55,208
Don't give up on me now, Dean.

401
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,125
It's never gonna stop.

402
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,792
I love you.

403
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:11,000
They ruined me in there tonight.

404
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,542
I love you.

405
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:17,458
Do you hear me?

406
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:25,583
What?

407
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:29,500
All right.

408
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:32,042
Let's just go to my place.

409
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,792
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

410
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,583
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

411
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:00,625
Fenster and McManus
had a cagey proposition,

412
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:03,417
a fast-jump, high-risk, long money.

413
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,500
We all knew it could be done.

414
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:08,458
The way I figured,
to do it wrong meant killing.

415
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:10,833
To do it right took five men.

416
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,083
Five men meant Keaton.

417
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,125
Keaton took convincing.

418
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:20,417
New York's finest taxi service.

419
00:28:21,792 --> 00:28:23,042
Bullshit.

420
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:25,125
Bullshit.

421
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,458
They don't operate anymore.

422
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,458
McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct.

423
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,625
They're coming out for one job, Thursday.

424
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:35,458
They're picking up a guy smuggling
emeralds out of South America.

425
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,585
McManus already has a fence
set to take the stuff.

426
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:38,792
A fence? Who?

427
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:40,601
Some guy in California,
his name is redfoot.

428
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:43,542
- I never heard of him.
- You have to come.

429
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:47,958
- What's it to you whether I do it or not?
- They don't know me. You do.

430
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,375
They won't take me unless you go.

431
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,792
Look at me. I need this.

432
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:57,333
You're telling me you don't need this?
Is this your place?

433
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,580
Look, I'm not knocking you.

434
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:01,228
You look like you got a good little scam
going with this lawyer.

435
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:07,000
Sorry.

436
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:09,750
It's okay. It's okay.

437
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,167
You say it's the real thing? That's cool.

438
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:17,833
You okay?

439
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,667
I was out of line.

440
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,250
But they're never gonna stop with us,
you know that.

441
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:26,042
As clean as you could ever get,
they'll never let you go now.

442
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:29,500
This way, we hit the cops where it hurts
and we get well in the meantime.

443
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:35,958
You're sure you're okay?

444
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:37,875
I'll be all right.

445
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:53,625
Look, I"

446
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,375
- I sometimes get...
- Forget it.

447
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,292
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

448
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,833
How do they wanna do it?

449
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,625
McManus wants to go in shooting,
I say no.

450
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,875
Fenster? Hockney?

451
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,583
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

452
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:32,712
Now, I got a way to do it
without killing anyone.

453
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,542
But like I say,
they won't let me in without you.

454
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,750
Three million?

455
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:58,958
Maybe more.

456
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:04,958
No killing.

457
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,542
Not if we do it my way.

458
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:45,542
New York's finest taxi service
was not your normal taxi service.

459
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:48,042
It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD

460
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,583
that ran a high-profit racket,

461
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,083
driving smugglers and drug dealers
all over the city.

462
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,583
For a few hundred dollars a mile,

463
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,958
you got your own blue and white,
and a police escort.

464
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:57,958
They even had their own business cards.

465
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,458
After a while,
somebody started asking questions

466
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:02,208
and the taxi service shut down.

467
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:03,375
Ever since then,

468
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,958
internal affairs have been waiting
to catch them in the act.

469
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,833
And that's where we came in.

470
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,708
- So, how was the flight?
- Fucking great.

471
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,500
Will this get me to staten island?

472
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,958
You kidding me?
This'ii get you to Cape Cod.

473
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,875
McManus came to us with the job,
fenster got the vans,

474
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,583
hockney supplied the hardware,

475
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,292
icame through with how to do it
so no one got killed.

476
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:29,625
But Keaton?
Keaton put on the finishing touch.

477
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:33,792
A little "fuck you"
from the five of us to the NYPD.

478
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,792
All right, watch this, watch this.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

479
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,625
Careful, careful, careful!

480
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,792
Come on, asshole!

481
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:45,167
Holy shit!

482
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:49,208
- Don't move, you fucker!
- Drop it now, motherfucker!

483
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:51,333
Drop the fucking gun! Drop it!

484
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,708
Don't fucking move.
Don't fucking touch a fucking thing.

485
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,309
- What the fuck do you guys want?
- Put your fucking thing away.

486
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,375
We're cops, you stupid assholes!

487
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:01,125
- Watch the glass!
- Don't fucking move, motherfucker!

488
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,292
You want a buckshot shampoo, chubby?

489
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:04,750
Shut up!

490
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,708
Oh, fuck!

491
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,333
Afternoon, my little pork chops.
Now give me the shit.

492
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,140
- Don't move!
- Give him the fucking shit!

493
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,268
Give him the fucking thing!
Give him the fucking thing!

494
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:19,000
Give him the fucking shit, man!

495
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:21,625
- Give it to me.
- Hurry up! Come on!

496
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,542
- Now the money.
- There's no money.

497
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:25,143
Give me the money right now,
motherfucker!

498
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:26,167
There's no fucking money.

499
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,610
- Give him the money right now!
- Give me the fucking money!

500
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:31,184
- Do it! Give him the money!
- Give me the fucking money!

501
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:33,458
- Give him the money!
- Hurry up!

502
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,833
You know the fucking...
You know who the fuck I am?

503
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,708
You people know who the fuck I am? Fuck!

504
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:42,125
We do now, jerk-off.

505
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,417
Cocksucker.

506
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,875
Wait a minute. What's that? Oh, shit.

507
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:54,917
What the fuck was...

508
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,333
Holy shit!

509
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:00,958
Go, go, go!

510
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:15,000
Keaton made an anonymous phone call.

511
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:17,625
The press was on the scene
before the police were.

512
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:20,167
Strausz and rizzi
were indicted three days later.

513
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:23,333
Within a few weeks,
50 more cops went down with them.

514
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,083
Everybody got it right in the ass,
from the chief on down.

515
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,875
It was beautiful.

516
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:38,625
I owe you $2.50.

517
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,375
Dr. Keaton.

518
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:47,250
- There's more here than I thought.
- When's the fence coming?

519
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:50,792
Redfoot never comes to see me,
I always go to see him.

520
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:53,708
In California?

521
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:57,292
Yes, verbal,
in California. Fenster and I...

522
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,333
Wait, wait, wait. Hold the fucking phone.

523
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,875
You and fenster? No, no, no, no.

524
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,792
- You fucking kidding me?
- Okay, so, then who's gonna go?

525
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:08,042
We all go!

526
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,292
What's your fucking problem, man?

527
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:13,542
My fucking problem, man,

528
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,934
is that you and fenster
are off honeymooning in California,

529
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,976
while the rest of us are sitting here
holding our dicks.

530
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,958
Hey! The job's over.

531
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,292
Cool it.

532
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:25,542
La's a good place to lie low for a while.

533
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:29,792
You wanna dance?

534
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:38,625
Ladies.

535
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:48,417
I would like to propose a toast.

536
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:51,292
There you go.

537
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,500
To Mr. Verbal,

538
00:35:57,042 --> 00:35:58,708
the man with the plan.

539
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:14,000
We're gonna miss the flight.

540
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:17,417
Don't do this. Send her a note, something.

541
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,333
I said we'll make it.

542
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:55,917
We're gonna miss the plane.

543
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:59,583
She'll understand.

544
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:21,500
That's heartwarming. Really.

545
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:24,917
I'm weepy.

546
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:27,750
Jeff, you wanna wait outside?

547
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,577
You guys wanted to know
what happened after the lineup,

548
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:36,042
- I'm telling you.
- Come on, verbal.

549
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:38,250
Who do you think you're talking to?

550
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:40,917
You expect me to believe that he retired?

551
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,458
For a woman?

552
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:48,125
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

553
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,667
- He loved her.
- Sure.

554
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:54,208
And I'm supposed to believe that hitting
the taxi service wasn't his idea either.

555
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,792
It was all fenster and McManus.

556
00:37:55,958 --> 00:37:58,042
Come on, Keaton was a cop for four years.

557
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:59,928
Who else would know
the taxi service better?

558
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:01,768
Thatjob had his name
written all over on it.

559
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:03,192
But Edie had him all turned around.

560
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:05,042
Let me tell you something,

561
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,625
I know Dean Keaton.

562
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:09,625
I've been investigating him
for the past three years.

563
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:12,000
The guy I know
was a cold-blooded bastard.

564
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,875
Lad indicted him
on three counts of murder

565
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,917
before he was kicked off the force.

566
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:19,125
So, don't sell me the hooker
with a heart of gold.

567
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,917
You got him all wrong.

568
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,250
Do I?

569
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:26,500
Dean Keaton was under indictment
a total of seven times

570
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:28,208
while he was on the force.

571
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,833
In every case, witnesses
either reversed their testimony

572
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,333
to the grand jury
or died before they could testify.

573
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:39,833
When they finally did nail him for fraud,
he spent five years in sing sing.

574
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,958
He killed three prisoners inside.

575
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,708
Of course, I can't prove this,

576
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:48,250
but I can't prove the best part either.

577
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:51,542
Dean Keaton was dead.

578
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:54,083
Did you know that?

579
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:56,167
He died in a fire two years ago

580
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,792
during an investigation
into the murder of a witness

581
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:01,125
who was going to testify against him.

582
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:04,167
Two people saw Dean Keaton
walk into a warehouse he owned

583
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,125
just before it blew up.

584
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:09,167
They said he went in
to check a leaking gas main.

585
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:13,417
It blew up
and took all of Dean Keaton with it.

586
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,417
Within three months of the explosion,
the two witnesses, they were dead.

587
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:22,167
One killed himself in his car.

588
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:25,167
The other fell down
an open elevator shaft.

589
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:29,768
- Agent baer?
- Let's get this show on the road.

590
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,018
- Agent baer?
- Yeah, wait, just wait, hold on.

591
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:32,184
This is not what we discussed.

592
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:33,434
There are far too many people
in this room.

593
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:34,893
Doctor, look.
I promise we'll be out of here

594
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,101
before he blows his porch light, okay?

595
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,893
- I have a noon meeting, baer.
- Yeah. Okay, look.

596
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,477
- Agent baer, five minutes.
- Everyone just calm down, all right?

597
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:43,542
I want you to ask this man
about the shootout in the harbor.

598
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:58,750
- He says they were buying...
- Dope. We know.

599
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,625
He doesn't know what they were buying,
but not dope.

600
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:09,792
- People.
- What?

601
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,417
He needs guarantees...

602
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,383
- What is he talking about, guarantees?
- He says his life's in danger.

603
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:27,500
He saw the devil, looked him in the eye.

604
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,458
- I'm on my way.
- No, no, no. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

605
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:34,792
Ask him to tell him what he told me
about the devil.

606
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:37,500
Who's the devil?

607
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:44,250
Keyser soze.

608
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,458
Keyser soze?

609
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:53,458
Yeah, he was in the harbor,
killing many men.

610
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:55,958
He saw keyser soze?

611
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:04,958
- He saw his face.
- All right. All right, look, okay?

612
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:08,042
Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

613
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:10,000
- Describe him.
- Okay.

614
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,667
Six weeks ago,
I get an anonymous phone call

615
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:21,792
telling me I can find Keaton
eating at mondino's with his attorney.

616
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:23,042
And there he is.

617
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:26,583
Now, because he never profited
from his alleged death,

618
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,250
and because we convicted someone else

619
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:31,625
of the murder we tried to pin on him,
we had to let him go.

620
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:36,167
He was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over,

621
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:38,000
and then he had lunch.

622
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:39,750
I don't know about that.

623
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:44,208
Oh, I don't think you do.
But you say you saw Keaton die.

624
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,833
I think you're covering his ass,
and he's still out there somewhere.

625
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,250
I think he's behind that whole circus
at the harbor.

626
00:41:50,417 --> 00:41:52,375
My bet is he's using you
because you're stupid

627
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:53,833
and you think he's your friend.

628
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,083
You tell me he's dead, so be it.

629
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,417
I wanna be sure he's dead
before I go back to New York.

630
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,833
He wasn't behind anything,
it was the lawyer.

631
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:06,042
What lawyer? What lawyer, verbal?

632
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:09,168
You know, back when I was in that
barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois...

633
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:11,667
You don't think that I know
you held out on the da?

634
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,473
What did you leave out of that testimony?

635
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:15,663
I could be on the phone to Ruby deemer
in 10 minutes.

636
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:18,417
- The da gave me immunity.
- Not from me.

637
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:20,958
You get no immunity from me,
you piece of shit.

638
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:24,500
Every criminal I have put in prison,
every cop that owes me a favor,

639
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,042
every creep and scumbag
that walks the street for a living

640
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:28,583
will know the name of verbal kint.

641
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,000
Now, you talk to me

642
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:32,542
or that precious immunity
they seem so fit to Grant you

643
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:36,250
won't be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on.

644
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:40,458
There was a lawyer.

645
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,458
Kobayashi.

646
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:48,917
- Is he the one that killed Keaton?
- No. But I'm sure Keaton is dead.

647
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:51,333
Convince me.

648
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:54,125
And tell me every last detail.

649
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:17,208
We arrived in Los Angeles
and met McManus' fence, redfoot.

650
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:21,125
He had a good reputation.
Seemed like a good guy.

651
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,792
Still, we should have known better.

652
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:24,958
How you doing?

653
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:27,833
- Good. You?
- Not bad. Can't complain.

654
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,250
How's it going, fenster?

655
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,125
Don't need to open it, right?

656
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:41,208
You must be Keaton.

657
00:43:42,292 --> 00:43:44,208
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.

658
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:48,375
- Todd hockney and verbal kint.
- Verbal, the man with the plan, huh?

659
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:50,708
You guys interested in any more work?

660
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,625
- We're always looking for extra work.
- We're on vacation.

661
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:57,125
Oh, well, that's too bad.

662
00:43:58,042 --> 00:44:00,208
I got a ton of work
and I don't have any good people.

663
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:02,458
- Not like you guys.
- What's the job?

664
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,625
There's this jeweler out of Texas
named Saul.

665
00:44:05,792 --> 00:44:07,833
He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.

666
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:09,875
He does free appraisals for people.

667
00:44:10,042 --> 00:44:11,625
Sometimes he buys,
sometimes he doesn't.

668
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:14,500
Anyway, the word is,
he carries around a lot of cash.

669
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:19,042
So I figure, I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green.

670
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,958
- Simple.
- What about security?

671
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:24,542
Couple of bodyguards,
nothing you couldn't handle.

672
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:29,458
- Give me time to check it out?
- I expect nothing less from you, man.

673
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:33,268
- Good to see you. We'll call you.
- Good to see you, too.

674
00:44:33,292 --> 00:44:36,333
- All right.
- Enjoy la, huh? Get yourself laid.

675
00:44:36,792 --> 00:44:37,792
Hey.

676
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:45,167
A friend of mine in New York
tells me that you knew spook Hollis.

677
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:48,750
The way I hear it,
you did time with old spook.

678
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:50,667
Good man, wasn't he?

679
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:53,292
I used to run dope for him.

680
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:56,500
- Too bad he got shivved.
- Yeah.

681
00:44:58,542 --> 00:44:59,750
Ishivved him.

682
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:05,167
Better you hear it from me now
than from somebody else later.

683
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,875
I appreciate that.

684
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:11,667
Just out of curiosity,

685
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:15,042
was it business or personal?

686
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:18,417
Bit of both.

687
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:22,042
Well, like I said,

688
00:45:22,417 --> 00:45:24,417
you give me a call
if you're interested, all right?

689
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:30,708
Is there a problem?

690
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:35,542
One job. That was the deal.

691
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:42,625
One job?

692
00:45:45,792 --> 00:45:47,000
One job?

693
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:50,792
That's a good one, Keaton.

694
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,542
Keaton fought it as best he could,
but a man can't change what he is.

695
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:59,708
He can convince anyone
he's someone else, but never himself.

696
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:03,042
It took one day with McManus nagging
and we went back to work.

697
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:20,750
So anyways, I get out of my car
and the thing is wrecked.

698
00:46:20,917 --> 00:46:24,042
I look in the backseat of the other car
and this woman's totally naked.

699
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:27,292
- I'm laughing so hard I can't breathe.
- Get in the car, Saul.

700
00:46:27,792 --> 00:46:30,083
Freeze, motherfucker, freeze!
Stay right there!

701
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,250
There we go!

702
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,625
There's a second one here somewhere.

703
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:40,667
Give me the case.
Give me the fucking case!

704
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:50,417
Give me the fucking case.
I'm telling you for the last time.

705
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,667
Give me the fucking case!

706
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,458
- Come on!
- Hey, hey! Don't move!

707
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,625
Look, just hand over the case.

708
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,417
Hand over the fucking case.

709
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:04,542
Come on, let's go!

710
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,792
- Come on!
- Bad day.

711
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:09,292
- Come on, let's go!
- Fuck it.

712
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:10,958
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

713
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:36,292
Fuck.

714
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,792
Looks like a lot of China to me. Shit.

715
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:49,917
Guys, come on.

716
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:52,292
What are you doing?

717
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:53,934
What's it look like I'm doing?
I'm gonna kill him.

718
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:55,976
Look, we did it your way,
now we're gonna do it my way.

719
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,559
- Are you gonna kill him?
- I'm gonna deal with him.

720
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:59,943
- Yeah, you better deal with him.
- I'm gonna deal with him.

721
00:49:00,042 --> 00:49:01,042
Shut up.

722
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:09,858
What am I supposed to do with that?

723
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:14,208
I don't know, feed it to the gimp.
Ease his pain. I don't know what that is.

724
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:15,975
What do you mean you don't know?
Shut up.

725
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,667
I don't know.
I got thrown this job by some lawyer.

726
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:19,833
Yeah, who?

727
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,708
I don't know, some limey.

728
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,625
He's a middleman for somebody, okay?
He doesn't say, I don't ask.

729
00:49:25,792 --> 00:49:28,167
- You're fucking full of shit!
- Fuck you.

730
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,583
- Fuck you.
- Listen to me.

731
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:32,083
We wanna meet him, okay?

732
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:34,250
That's funny.

733
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,333
He called me last night,
he says he wants to meet you guys.

734
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:41,083
Okay, we'll meet him.

735
00:49:41,583 --> 00:49:42,583
- I'll call you.
- Good.

736
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:44,184
- Do that. No problem. Let's go.
- I don't like it, Dean.

737
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:46,792
I don't like it. Wait a minute.
One more thing, tough guy.

738
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:49,500
Any more surprises,
and I'm gonna kill you.

739
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:54,583
You're such a tough guy, McManus.
But do me a favor, all right?

740
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,125
- Get the fuck off my dick.
- Fuck!

741
00:49:57,292 --> 00:49:58,667
Don't, don't.

742
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,375
Put a leash on that puppy.

743
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:06,833
You know, it's an awful shame
about Saul getting whacked.

744
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:09,585
Cops are gonna be
looking for the guys who did it.

745
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:13,208
Sooner or later
they're gonna come around asking me.

746
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:17,417
You have a sweet night, ladies.

747
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:23,250
Fuck you.

748
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:32,042
- So this lawyer...
- Kobayashi.

749
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,292
- Came from redfoot.
- Right.

750
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:38,458
And why leave this out
when you talked to the da?

751
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:40,667
Dave, someone to see you.

752
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,333
Jack.

753
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,292
I've been looking all over for you.

754
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:50,476
You still after that coke
that took a walk out of that bloodbath

755
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,250
- in the harbor yesterday?
- Yeah.

756
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:54,458
Well, you can stop looking.
There was no coke.

757
00:50:55,208 --> 00:50:57,969
I've been in la county talking to a guy
they pulled out of a drainpipe

758
00:50:58,083 --> 00:51:00,167
in San Pedro yesterday after the shootout.

759
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,667
He came to this morning,
he started talking.

760
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:03,958
He's part of a Hungarian mob

761
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:06,143
there to do a deal
with a bunch of gwats from Argentina,

762
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:08,625
and he says
it was definitely not a dope deal.

763
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:10,101
- But the 91 million...
- Yeah. We know.

764
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:12,000
But our man says no way on the dope.

765
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:13,727
This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch

766
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:15,667
was pulling stumps for Turkey
the next day.

767
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:17,768
They had no time to negotiate
that kind of product

768
00:51:17,792 --> 00:51:19,250
and no means to move it.

769
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:21,333
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know.

770
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:24,292
No one doing the deal knew
except for a few key people.

771
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:26,625
They were all very hush about it, he says.

772
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:30,917
- Whatever it was, it was very sensitive.
- I don't get it.

773
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,783
They tell me you got the cripple in there
from New York.

774
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:35,583
- Yeah.
- Did he mention keyser soze?

775
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:36,792
Who?

776
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:38,958
Just bear with me here.

777
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,792
- Who's keyser soze?
- Oh, fuck!

778
00:51:44,792 --> 00:51:47,958
We've been going over this
for an hour and a half.

779
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:50,292
What we need to do
is find redfoot, Keaton...

780
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:52,298
- Listen.
- And get the hell out of here, now.

781
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,000
What we need to do is think.

782
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,875
Think back.

783
00:51:57,125 --> 00:51:59,667
Somebody with power,

784
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:03,375
somebody who was capable of tracking
us from New York to Los Angeles.

785
00:52:03,542 --> 00:52:05,382
Come on, Dean,
what the hell are we doing here?

786
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:06,792
We're waiting.

787
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:08,292
- Sit down.
- Bye, now.

788
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,417
- Sit down.
- No.

789
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:11,125
It's hot and I'm fucking bored.

790
00:52:11,292 --> 00:52:13,083
Mr. Hockney, do stay.

791
00:52:13,792 --> 00:52:15,167
Mr. Keaton.

792
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:17,792
Mr. Fenster I recognize
from his mug shots,

793
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:22,000
as well as Mr. McManus.
I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint,

794
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:24,750
the gentleman who disposed of Saul berg.

795
00:52:24,917 --> 00:52:28,625
My employer sends his gratitude,
a most unexpected benefit.

796
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:31,458
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

797
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:36,125
I have been asked by my employer
to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

798
00:52:36,292 --> 00:52:37,292
What do you want?

799
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:39,542
My employer requires
your services, gentlemen.

800
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:45,292
One job, one day's work. Very dangerous.

801
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:48,958
He does not expect all of you to live,
but those of you who do

802
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:52,958
will have $91 million to divide
between you in any way you see fit.

803
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:54,167
Who's your boss?

804
00:52:57,042 --> 00:52:58,750
I work for keyser soze.

805
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,125
Who's keyser soze?

806
00:53:11,292 --> 00:53:13,667
Judging by the sudden change
in mood, Mr. Kint,

807
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:16,167
I feel sure the rest of your associates
can tell you.

808
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I come with an offer
directly from Mr. Soze.

809
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:23,917
- An order, actually.
- What do you mean, "an order"?

810
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:25,750
In 1981, Mr. Keaton,

811
00:53:25,917 --> 00:53:29,458
you participated in the hijacking
of a truck in buffalo, New York.

812
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:33,167
The cargo was raw steel,
steel which belonged to Mr. Soze

813
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:37,125
and which was destined for Pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

814
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:40,708
A most profitable violation
of UN regulations.

815
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:42,875
You had no way of knowing this,
Mr. Keaton,

816
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:46,083
because the fellow shipping the steel
was working for Mr. Soze

817
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,500
without his knowledge.

818
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:50,750
Earlier this year,
Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus

819
00:53:50,917 --> 00:53:54,583
hijacked a two-prop cargo flight
out of Newark airport.

820
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,292
The plane was carrying
gold and platinum wiring

821
00:53:57,458 --> 00:53:58,958
also set for Pakistan.

822
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:03,000
Two months ago,
Mr. Hockney stole a truck

823
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:05,000
carrying gun parts through queens.

824
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:07,625
Gun parts which were set to be destroyed

825
00:54:07,792 --> 00:54:09,458
by the state of New York.

826
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:13,333
They were to be lost in a way station
and rerouted to Belfast.

827
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,500
Again, Mr. Soze using pawns
who had no knowledge.

828
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:18,958
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.

829
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:22,625
Nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze's

830
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:27,375
less-than-intelligent couriers was taken
in a complicated confidence scam

831
00:54:28,042 --> 00:54:29,042
by a cripple.

832
00:54:29,917 --> 00:54:32,333
He was relieved of $62,000.

833
00:54:33,042 --> 00:54:35,875
Now, it has taken us
some time to find you.

834
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:40,042
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

835
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:42,375
- You set up the lineup.
- Yes.

836
00:54:42,542 --> 00:54:44,958
You were not to be released
until I had come to see you.

837
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:47,917
It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney,
Ms. Finneran,

838
00:54:48,292 --> 00:54:51,958
was a little too effective
in expediting his release.

839
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:54,167
Holding the rest of you
became a moot point.

840
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,125
- What about redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

841
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:59,708
Mr. Soze rarely works
with the same people for very long

842
00:54:59,917 --> 00:55:01,917
and they never know
who they're working for.

843
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:05,792
One cannot be betrayed
if one has no people.

844
00:55:06,792 --> 00:55:08,875
So, why are you telling us?

845
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:13,167
Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze,
Mr. Fenster.

846
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:14,333
All of you.

847
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,750
That you did not know you stole from him

848
00:55:16,917 --> 00:55:18,477
is the only reason you are still alive.

849
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,667
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.

850
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:26,875
All right, fuck the debt, and fuck you.
How do we know you work for soze?

851
00:55:27,417 --> 00:55:30,125
I don't think that is very relevant,
Mr. Hockney.

852
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:33,375
All five of you are responsible
for the murder of Saul berg

853
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:34,750
and his bodyguards.

854
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,625
Mr. Redfoot can testify
to your involvement

855
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,458
and we can see to it that he will.

856
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:42,667
- What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen.

857
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,292
Mr. Soze's primary interest

858
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:46,958
is narcotics.

859
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:49,708
He has been competing, shall we say,

860
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:52,292
with a group of argentineans
for several years, now.

861
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:55,417
Competing with Mr. Soze
has taken its toll.

862
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:58,875
These argentineans
are negotiating the sale

863
00:55:59,042 --> 00:56:02,583
of $91 million in cocaine
in three days' time.

864
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:05,875
Needless to say,
this purchase will revitalize

865
00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:08,708
the diminishing strength
of their organization.

866
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,792
Mr. Soze would like you to stop the deal.

867
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:16,625
Now, if you choose,
you may wait until after the buy.

868
00:56:16,792 --> 00:56:18,792
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

869
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,583
Mr. Soze would like you to get to the boat

870
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,125
and destroy the cocaine on board.

871
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:29,708
And then you will be free
of your obligations to Mr. Soze.

872
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,917
You give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right now.

873
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:40,000
A gift from Mr. Soze.

874
00:56:43,417 --> 00:56:45,167
Good day, gentlemen.

875
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:57,375
They got my whole life in here,
everything I've ever done since I was 18.

876
00:57:57,875 --> 00:57:59,292
They fucking know everything.

877
00:58:00,042 --> 00:58:02,208
Everybody I've ever worked with
or did time with.

878
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:22,708
- This isn't right.
- I don't know.

879
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:25,250
Who's that guy used to
talk about soze in New York?

880
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:28,792
Bricks marlin.

881
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:31,792
Yeah, he did jobs for him, indirect stuff.

882
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,268
And he said he always made
five times more money on it

883
00:58:34,292 --> 00:58:35,292
than the job was worth.

884
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:38,375
This guy's a pipe dream.

885
00:58:38,542 --> 00:58:40,792
Kobayashi's using him
for window dressing.

886
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:42,958
I don't know. This is bad.

887
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:44,625
No, it's bullshit.

888
00:58:44,792 --> 00:58:47,000
This guy could be LAPD.
It's a fucking setup.

889
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,917
The way I hear it,
soze's some kind of butcher.

890
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:55,583
- A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.
- There is no keyser soze!

891
00:58:58,375 --> 00:59:00,125
Who is keyser soze?

892
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:04,875
He's supposed to be Turkish.
Some say his father was German.

893
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,625
Nobody ever believed he was real.

894
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:10,583
Nobody ever knew him or saw anybody
that ever worked directly for him,

895
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:13,583
but to hear kobayashi tell it,
anybody could have worked for soze.

896
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,292
You never knew. That was his power.

897
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:20,958
The greatest trick the devil ever pulled

898
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:23,958
was convincing the world he didn't exist.

899
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:28,125
One story the guys told me,
the story I believe,

900
00:59:28,292 --> 00:59:29,958
was from his days in Turkey.

901
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:32,833
There was a gang of Hungarians
that wanted their own mob.

902
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,333
They realized that to be in power,
you didn't need guns

903
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,875
or money oi“ even numbers.

904
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:41,625
You just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldn't.

905
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:45,125
After a while, they come into power
and then they come after soze.

906
00:59:45,292 --> 00:59:47,750
He was small-time then.
Just running dope, they say.

907
00:59:51,292 --> 00:59:52,333
They come to his home

908
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:55,250
in the afternoon looking for his business.

909
00:59:55,417 --> 00:59:57,017
They find his wife and kids in the house

910
00:59:57,125 --> 00:59:58,917
and decide to wait for soze.

911
01:00:15,417 --> 01:00:19,625
He comes home to find his wife raped
and children screaming.

912
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:23,042
The Hungarians knew soze was tough,
not to be trifled with,

913
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:24,958
so they let him know they meant business.

914
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:33,833
They tell him they want his territory,
all his business.

915
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:38,042
Soze looks over the faces of his family,

916
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:43,125
then he showed these men of will
what will really was.

917
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:05,875
He tells him he would
rather see his family dead

918
01:01:06,042 --> 01:01:08,125
than live another day after this.

919
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,542
He lets the last Hungarian go,

920
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:14,127
he waits until his wife and kids
are in the ground

921
01:01:14,292 --> 01:01:16,167
and then he goes
after the rest of the mob.

922
01:01:16,625 --> 01:01:19,000
He kills their kids, he kills their wives,

923
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:21,625
he kills their parents
and their parents' friends.

924
01:01:22,125 --> 01:01:24,417
He burns down the houses they live in

925
01:01:25,292 --> 01:01:26,750
and the stores they work in.

926
01:01:27,542 --> 01:01:31,083
He kills people that owe them money.
And like that,

927
01:01:32,417 --> 01:01:34,292
he's gone, underground.

928
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:36,875
Nobody's ever seen him since.
He becomes a myth.

929
01:01:37,042 --> 01:01:40,000
A spook story
that criminals tell their kids at night.

930
01:01:40,167 --> 01:01:43,292
"Rat on your pop,
and keyser soze will get you."

931
01:01:44,292 --> 01:01:46,083
And no one ever really believes.

932
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,083
Do you believe in him, verbal?

933
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,833
Keaton always said,

934
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,292
"I don't believe in god,
but I'm afraid of him."

935
01:01:58,333 --> 01:01:59,833
Well, I believe in god,

936
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:04,667
and the only thing that scares me
is keyser soze.

937
01:02:11,792 --> 01:02:13,083
You give any weight to this?

938
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:16,167
I can introduce you to Dan metzheiser
from justice.

939
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:18,042
He's got a file on soze in DC.

940
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:20,000
Been a hobby of his for a couple of years.

941
01:02:20,167 --> 01:02:23,417
A lot of guys equate him to that reporter
on the incredible hulk.

942
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:30,875
- You've heard of him?
- What, on the street?

943
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:32,417
- Yeah.
- Yeah, a few times.

944
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:34,208
You know, outside stuff.

945
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:36,958
Somebody working for a guy
who worked for a guy

946
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:38,667
who got some money from keyser soze.

947
01:02:38,833 --> 01:02:40,000
You know, shit like that.

948
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:43,625
You know, it could be an old badge.
You know, a hex sign.

949
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:44,934
Keep people from fucking with you

950
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:46,542
back when a name
used to mean something.

951
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:48,875
- But you're here.
- Well, shit, yeah.

952
01:02:49,042 --> 01:02:50,309
I got a guy trying to
walk out of a hospital

953
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,625
on a fried drumstick
because he's afraid of soze.

954
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:54,985
Yeah, I'll run it up the flagpole.

955
01:02:57,458 --> 01:02:59,875
I came clean.
I told it like it happened on the boat.

956
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,562
So what if I left out how I got there?

957
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:04,708
It's so full of holes, the da would've
told me to blow amnesty out my ass.

958
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:07,059
So you got what you wanted out of me,
so big fucking deal.

959
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:10,125
- So that's why you never told the da?
- Well, you tell me, agent kujan.

960
01:03:10,292 --> 01:03:12,559
If I told you the Loch Ness monster
hired me to hit the harbor,

961
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:14,383
- what would you say?
- Turn state's evidence.

962
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:15,893
We'll put you on the stand,
we'll hear it out.

963
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,292
I've got immunity now.
What can you possibly offer me?

964
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:21,183
If there really is a keyser soze,
he's gonna come looking for you.

965
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:24,042
Where's your head, agent kujan?

966
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:26,309
Where do you think
the pressure's coming from?

967
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:28,053
Keyser soze,
or whatever you wanna call him,

968
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:29,583
he knows where I am right now.

969
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:31,830
He's got the front burner
under your ass to let me go

970
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:33,583
so he can scoop me up ten minutes later.

971
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:35,917
Immunity was just a deal
with you assholes.

972
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:37,763
I got a whole new problem
when I post bail.

973
01:03:38,042 --> 01:03:39,882
So why play into his hands?
We can protect you.

974
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:44,917
Oh, gee. Thanks, Dave.
Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion.

975
01:03:45,083 --> 01:03:47,042
You'll pardon me
if I ask you to kiss my pucker.

976
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:49,559
The same fuckers that rounded us up
and sank us into this mess

977
01:03:49,583 --> 01:03:51,417
are now bailing me out? Fuck you.

978
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:56,000
You think you can catch keyser soze?

979
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:59,625
You think a guy like that
comes this close to getting caught

980
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:00,958
and sticks his head out?

981
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:04,083
If he comes up for anything,
it'll be to get rid of me.

982
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:05,542
After that,

983
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:09,750
my guess is
you'll never hear from him again.

984
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,625
What happened next?

985
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,125
We woke up the next morning
and fenster was gone.

986
01:04:36,292 --> 01:04:38,958
He couldn't handle the idea
of slumming for soze.

987
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,833
He left us a note wishing us good luck

988
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,040
and took a chunk of the money
we'd scraped together.

989
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:45,000
Then what?

990
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:46,542
Well, McManus was furious.

991
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:49,268
He was talking about tracking him down
and ripping his heart out.

992
01:04:49,292 --> 01:04:50,500
All sorts of shit.

993
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:53,292
That night, we got the call.

994
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:55,458
What call?

995
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:58,042
Kobayashi told us
where we could find fenster.

996
01:05:06,042 --> 01:05:08,333
All right, let's get the fuck outta here.

997
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:11,458
We gotta Bury him.

998
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:13,208
With what?

999
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:15,125
With our hands.

1000
01:05:24,917 --> 01:05:26,500
Oh, this is nuts.

1001
01:05:26,667 --> 01:05:28,458
It's dry fucking sand, McManus.

1002
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:32,125
When he rots, the surfers are gonna
smell him a mile away.

1003
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:34,172
- Dig, you fuck.
- Keaton, what are we gonna do?

1004
01:05:34,292 --> 01:05:36,167
This fucking guy is gonna kill us.

1005
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:37,934
I don't know about you, peg-leg,
but I can run.

1006
01:05:37,958 --> 01:05:40,125
I got no problem with that.

1007
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:43,875
Kobayashi doesn't seem
to have a problem with it either.

1008
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:47,792
You run, and we're gonna be
digging a hole for you.

1009
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:49,042
You got that?

1010
01:05:49,917 --> 01:05:53,625
This ain't my boy we're burying.
I don't owe anybody!

1011
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:57,750
- So fuck you.
- He was my partner for five years.

1012
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:00,750
We did more jobs and I saw more money

1013
01:06:00,917 --> 01:06:03,458
than you can ever count. So fuck you!

1014
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:06,875
- 'Cause now it's payback!
- It's not payback!

1015
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:11,542
It's precaution.

1016
01:06:11,708 --> 01:06:13,875
You want payback? You wanna run?
I don't care.

1017
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:19,458
I'm not doing this for fenster.

1018
01:06:20,667 --> 01:06:22,250
I'm not doing it for you.

1019
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:25,542
I'm doing this for me.

1020
01:06:27,792 --> 01:06:29,292
I'm gonna finish this thing.

1021
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:33,458
This kobayashi bastard
is not gonna stand on me.

1022
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:56,833
And after they killed fenster,
nobody would run?

1023
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,833
- I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
- Why didn't you say anything?

1024
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,542
Believe me, itried,
but Keaton wouldn't have it.

1025
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:05,458
It was too far-fetched for him.

1026
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:08,083
Keaton was a grounded guy, an ex-cop.

1027
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:10,917
To a cop, the explanation
is never that complicated.

1028
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:12,708
It's always simple.

1029
01:07:12,875 --> 01:07:15,542
There's no mystery to the street,
no arch-criminal behind it all.

1030
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:17,726
If you got a dead body
and you think his brother did it,

1031
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,150
you're gonna find out you're right.

1032
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:20,458
Nobody argued with Keaton.

1033
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:22,667
They just set their minds
to whacking kobayashi.

1034
01:07:33,792 --> 01:07:34,875
They're coming up.

1035
01:07:36,583 --> 01:07:40,708
- Did you hear me? He's coming up.
- He's on his way down.

1036
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,583
Don't move.

1037
01:08:39,292 --> 01:08:41,000
Press 20. Do it now.

1038
01:09:01,458 --> 01:09:02,542
Move.

1039
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:08,958
- The answer is no.
- Mr. Soze will be most upset.

1040
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:11,042
Listen, you cocksucker,
there is no keyser soze.

1041
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:13,268
You mention his name again,
and I'll kill you right now.

1042
01:09:13,292 --> 01:09:14,792
A strange threat, Mr. Keaton.

1043
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:17,292
I can only assume that
you've come here to kill me anyway.

1044
01:09:23,042 --> 01:09:25,583
We know that you can get to us,

1045
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:28,250
but now you know that we can get to you.

1046
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:32,167
I'm giving you one last chance
to call this off.

1047
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:33,792
Mr. So...

1048
01:09:34,292 --> 01:09:36,292
My employer has made up his mind.

1049
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:38,708
- He does not change it.
- Neither do we.

1050
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:42,333
You got fenster,
but you won't be able to get all of us,

1051
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,167
not before one of us gets through to you.

1052
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:48,250
I believe you, Mr. McManus.
I most sincerely do.

1053
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:51,583
You would not have been chosen,
were you not so suitable.

1054
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:55,042
But I cannot make this decision.
Whatever you threaten me with is

1055
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:58,583
ludicrous in comparison
to what will be done to me

1056
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,500
if I do not carry out my orders in full.

1057
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,500
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

1058
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,875
I just wanted you to know that.

1059
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:18,125
I'm so sorry, Mr. McManus.

1060
01:10:18,583 --> 01:10:20,708
I implore you, Mr. Keaton, believe me,

1061
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:24,708
Mr. Soze is very real and very determined.

1062
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:26,000
We'll see.

1063
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:37,333
Before you do me in, Mr. McManus,

1064
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:41,000
you will let me finish my business
with Ms. Finneran first, won't you?

1065
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:47,792
What did you say?

1066
01:10:49,125 --> 01:10:50,792
Edie finneran.

1067
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:52,792
She's upstairs in my office

1068
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,833
for an extradition deposition.

1069
01:10:56,792 --> 01:10:59,542
I requested she be put
on the case personally.

1070
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:01,250
She flew in yesterday.

1071
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,625
No matter.

1072
01:11:05,292 --> 01:11:06,833
Kill away, Mr. McManus.

1073
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,458
You're lying.

1074
01:11:14,042 --> 01:11:15,125
Am I?

1075
01:11:32,542 --> 01:11:36,208
Ms. Finneran's escort
while she's here in Los Angeles.

1076
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,875
Never leaves her side for a moment.

1077
01:11:38,292 --> 01:11:40,583
I thought you would be glad to know
she's in good hands.

1078
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:48,333
Now, get some rest.
The boat will be ready for you on Friday.

1079
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:51,083
If I see you
or any of your friends before then,

1080
01:11:51,292 --> 01:11:54,875
Ms. Finneran will find herself the victim
of a most gruesome violation

1081
01:11:55,042 --> 01:11:56,042
before she dies.

1082
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:58,375
As indeed will your father, Mr. Hockney,

1083
01:11:59,125 --> 01:12:02,208
and your uncle Randall in Arizona,
Mr. Kint.

1084
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:06,458
I might only castrate
Mr. McManus' nephew, David.

1085
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:10,625
Do I make myself clear?

1086
01:12:11,792 --> 01:12:14,083
We will take care
of the two bodies downstairs.

1087
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:16,167
We'll add them to the cost of Mr. Fenster.

1088
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,773
Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

1089
01:12:57,667 --> 01:12:59,375
It's a logistical nightmare.

1090
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,792
Close quarters, 10, maybe 20 men.

1091
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:05,823
There's no telling how many more
are gonna be below deck.

1092
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:08,292
- Can we stealth these guys?
- Nah.

1093
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:10,875
With all that coke,
they're gonna be ready.

1094
01:13:13,042 --> 01:13:15,375
Which brings me
to sunny point number two.

1095
01:13:16,042 --> 01:13:19,458
Even if one of us gets through
and Jacks the boat, we still get nothing.

1096
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:21,083
What if we wait for the money?

1097
01:13:21,917 --> 01:13:23,792
Ten more men, at least.

1098
01:13:24,458 --> 01:13:27,625
Look, in my opinion, it can't be done.

1099
01:13:27,792 --> 01:13:29,833
Anybody who goes in there
is not coming out alive.

1100
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,875
- I'm gonna wait for the money.
- Me too.

1101
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:36,458
- Did you hear what he just said?
- If I'm going in, I want a cut.

1102
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:37,833
Me too.

1103
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:41,000
There's nothing that can't be done.

1104
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:46,750
I just can't believe
we're gonna walk into certain death.

1105
01:13:54,292 --> 01:13:56,292
The news said it's raining in New York.

1106
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,125
What language is that?

1107
01:14:20,458 --> 01:14:23,500
I don't know. Russian, I think.

1108
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:26,792
Hungafian.

1109
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:33,417
The package has arrived, gentlemen.

1110
01:15:53,292 --> 01:15:54,292
You kids ready?

1111
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:57,792
I would be if I didn't have to stop
and answer you.

1112
01:15:58,167 --> 01:15:59,292
I'm ready.

1113
01:15:59,667 --> 01:16:01,833
McManus, you better be set up
in 10 seconds.

1114
01:16:04,542 --> 01:16:05,542
I'm ready.

1115
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:08,667
I want you to stay here.

1116
01:16:10,125 --> 01:16:12,601
- I'm supposed to cover...
- Listen, if we don't get out of this,

1117
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:14,292
I want you to take the money and go.

1118
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:15,958
- Keaton, I can't...
- Find Edie.

1119
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:17,917
Tell her what happened.
Tell her everything.

1120
01:16:18,083 --> 01:16:19,667
She knows people. She knows what to do.

1121
01:16:20,292 --> 01:16:23,125
If I don't get kobayashi my way,
she'll get him her way.

1122
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:25,458
- What if I...
- Please, just do what I say.

1123
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,583
Please.

1124
01:16:30,917 --> 01:16:32,292
Tell her that...

1125
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:37,542
Tell her I tried.

1126
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,625
McManus, he's on his way.

1127
01:16:53,792 --> 01:16:54,875
I'm there.

1128
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:50,833
One, two, three, four,

1129
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:54,167
five, six, seven.

1130
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:57,292
Oswald was a fag.

1131
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:09,125
How you doing?

1132
01:18:11,792 --> 01:18:14,000
Is there... is there a problem?

1133
01:18:39,667 --> 01:18:40,667
Now.

1134
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:16,542
J“ old McDonald had a farm, e-i-e-i-o j“

1135
01:19:17,083 --> 01:19:21,708
j“ and on that farm he shot some guys I

1136
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,542
j“ bada-boom, bada-bing-bang-boom j'

1137
01:19:55,542 --> 01:19:56,708
Elvis has left the building.

1138
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:25,458
Hello.

1139
01:22:19,792 --> 01:22:21,125
Why didn't you run?

1140
01:22:21,958 --> 01:22:23,333
I froze up.

1141
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:27,458
I thought about fenster
and how he looked when we buried him.

1142
01:22:27,625 --> 01:22:30,458
And then I thought about Keaton,
it looked like he might pull it off.

1143
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:40,184
A boy came across a body
on the beach this morning.

1144
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:42,476
Thrown clear when the boat burned.
Shot twice in the head.

1145
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,333
Two guys from
the bureau just identified him.

1146
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,875
- What else?
- His name was arturro Marquez,

1147
01:22:47,042 --> 01:22:48,583
a petty smuggler from Argentina.

1148
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:51,500
He was arrested last year in New York
for trafficking.

1149
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:55,333
He escapes to California.
They pick him up in long beach.

1150
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,500
They're setting up extradition,
he escapes again.

1151
01:22:58,875 --> 01:23:00,167
Now, get this.

1152
01:23:00,333 --> 01:23:03,875
Edie finneran's brought in
to advise on the proceedings.

1153
01:23:04,042 --> 01:23:05,208
Kobayashi.

1154
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:07,458
New York faxed me a copy
of his testimony.

1155
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:10,125
- He was a rat.
- Yeah, a big fucking rat.

1156
01:23:10,292 --> 01:23:12,958
Arturro was very opposed
to returning to prison.

1157
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:17,083
So much so that he named
close to 50 people.

1158
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:19,625
Guess who he named in the finale.

1159
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:21,958
Keyser soze.

1160
01:23:22,292 --> 01:23:23,375
There's more.

1161
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:39,792
I'll tell you what I know.
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

1162
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:43,625
There was no dope on that boat.

1163
01:24:25,708 --> 01:24:26,875
You, stay quiet.

1164
01:24:27,292 --> 01:24:28,625
He's here.

1165
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:32,792
I know he's here. That's him.
I'm telling you, that's him.

1166
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:34,792
I know he's here!

1167
01:24:36,292 --> 01:24:39,125
- You can't understand. That's him.
- Shut up.

1168
01:24:39,292 --> 01:24:43,667
That's him, you hear me?
I'm telling you, it's keyser soze!

1169
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:43,958
- Where's hockney?
- I don't know.

1170
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:45,458
There's no coke.

1171
01:26:45,958 --> 01:26:47,750
- What?
- You heard me, you dumb fuck.

1172
01:26:47,917 --> 01:26:48,917
There's no coke!

1173
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,393
What the fuck do you mean,
there's no coke?

1174
01:26:50,417 --> 01:26:52,976
I've been up and down this ship.
I've been in every fucking room!

1175
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
- There's gotta be coke!
- There is nothing!

1176
01:26:55,333 --> 01:26:56,583
Nothing!

1177
01:26:56,958 --> 01:26:58,500
Don't you fuck with me.

1178
01:26:58,667 --> 01:27:02,500
There is no fucking coke!

1179
01:27:13,417 --> 01:27:15,042
I'm outta here.

1180
01:27:56,083 --> 01:27:57,833
I told them nothing.

1181
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,167
I swear.

1182
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:03,333
I told them nothing. Please.

1183
01:28:49,792 --> 01:28:52,208
McManus, what the fuck is going on?

1184
01:28:55,292 --> 01:28:56,708
Strangest thing.

1185
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:53,143
That's what you say in your statement.

1186
01:29:53,167 --> 01:29:54,875
You saw a man in a suit with a slim build.

1187
01:29:55,042 --> 01:29:56,642
- Wait a minute.
- I don't have a minute.

1188
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:58,583
Now, are you saying
you saw keyser soze?

1189
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:00,458
You told the da
you didn't know who it was.

1190
01:30:00,625 --> 01:30:02,125
I know there was dope on that boat.

1191
01:30:02,292 --> 01:30:03,893
- Stop stalling, verbal.
- I'm not stalling.

1192
01:30:03,917 --> 01:30:05,518
- You know what I'm getting at.
- Get out of my face.

1193
01:30:05,542 --> 01:30:07,268
- You know what I'm getting at.
- I got immunity.

1194
01:30:07,292 --> 01:30:09,684
- I don't have to take that shit.
- You know what, you know what...

1195
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:11,601
You know what I'm getting at, verbal.
Yes, you do!

1196
01:30:11,625 --> 01:30:13,684
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The truth!

1197
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:15,500
Try to tell me
you saw someone kill Keaton.

1198
01:30:15,667 --> 01:30:17,268
I don't know what you're talking about.
I did. I did.

1199
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:18,643
- You're lying to me.
- I am not...

1200
01:30:18,667 --> 01:30:20,833
You've known,
you've known this whole fucking time.

1201
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,518
- I don't know what you're saying.
- You know.

1202
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:24,792
I did see Keaton get shot, I swear to you.

1203
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:26,708
Then why didn't you help him?
You had a gun.

1204
01:30:26,875 --> 01:30:28,708
Why didn't you help him?
He was your friend.

1205
01:30:33,375 --> 01:30:34,708
Because I was afraid.

1206
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:37,083
Okay?

1207
01:30:37,417 --> 01:30:39,375
- Afraid.
- Afraid of what?

1208
01:30:41,125 --> 01:30:42,958
- Afraid of...
- I knew it was keyser soze.

1209
01:30:43,375 --> 01:30:45,458
- But Keaton.
- It was keyser soze, agent kujan.

1210
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:47,042
I mean, the devil himself.

1211
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:50,542
How do you shoot the devil in the back?

1212
01:30:55,833 --> 01:30:57,458
What if you miss?

1213
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:04,708
All right. Let's get back to the pier.

1214
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:31,083
- Arturro Marquez. Ever hear of him?
- What? No.

1215
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:34,125
He was a stool pigeon
for the justice department.

1216
01:32:34,292 --> 01:32:36,167
He swore out a statement
to federal marshals

1217
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:39,917
saying that he had seen
and could positively identify one

1218
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:41,333
keyser soze.

1219
01:32:41,792 --> 01:32:43,458
It says right here in the report.

1220
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:45,792
He had intimate knowledge
of his businesses,

1221
01:32:45,958 --> 01:32:49,625
including, but not exclusive to,
drug trafficking and murder.

1222
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,417
I never heard of him.

1223
01:32:51,583 --> 01:32:53,917
His own people were selling him
to a gang of Hungarians.

1224
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:57,708
Most likely the same Hungarians that
soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.

1225
01:32:58,125 --> 01:32:59,417
The money wasn't there for dope.

1226
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,375
The Hungarians were going
to buy the one guy

1227
01:33:02,625 --> 01:33:04,292
that could incriminate keyser soze.

1228
01:33:04,958 --> 01:33:06,917
- I said I never heard of him.
- But Keaton did.

1229
01:33:07,417 --> 01:33:10,375
Edie finneran was Marquez's
extradition advisor.

1230
01:33:10,542 --> 01:33:12,022
She knew who he was and what he knew.

1231
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:14,667
- I don't...
- There were no drugs on that boat.

1232
01:33:15,125 --> 01:33:16,292
It was a hit.

1233
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:18,917
A suicide mission
to whack out the one guy

1234
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:21,125
that could finger keyser soze.

1235
01:33:21,458 --> 01:33:23,292
So, soze put some thieves to it,

1236
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:26,125
men he knew he could march
into certain death.

1237
01:33:26,458 --> 01:33:28,833
You're saying soze
sent us to kill someone?

1238
01:33:29,958 --> 01:33:32,792
I'm saying Keaton did.
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason.

1239
01:33:33,208 --> 01:33:34,792
Just do what I tell you.

1240
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:38,000
If you all knew that soze
could find you anywhere,

1241
01:33:38,167 --> 01:33:40,083
why did he give you the money to run?

1242
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:43,250
- He could have used you on the boat.
- He wanted me to live.

1243
01:33:45,167 --> 01:33:47,750
A one-time dirty cop
without a loyalty in the world

1244
01:33:47,917 --> 01:33:51,125
finds it in his heart
to save a worthless rat cripple?

1245
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:52,833
No, sir. Why?

1246
01:33:53,292 --> 01:33:54,292
Edie.

1247
01:33:54,583 --> 01:33:57,042
I don't buy
that reform story for a minute.

1248
01:33:57,333 --> 01:33:58,500
Even if I did,

1249
01:33:58,667 --> 01:34:01,792
I certainly don't believe
he would send you to protect her.

1250
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:03,833
So, why?

1251
01:34:06,208 --> 01:34:08,000
Because he was my friend.

1252
01:34:08,167 --> 01:34:12,417
No, verbal, he wasn't your friend.
Keaton didn't have friends.

1253
01:34:12,583 --> 01:34:13,583
What are you doing here?

1254
01:34:13,667 --> 01:34:16,292
He saved you
because he wanted it that way.

1255
01:34:16,458 --> 01:34:17,625
It was his will.

1256
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:20,750
- Keaton was keyser soze.
- No.

1257
01:34:20,917 --> 01:34:22,958
The kind of man
who could wrangle the wills of men

1258
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:24,375
like hockney and McManus.

1259
01:34:24,542 --> 01:34:26,958
The kind of man
who could engineer a police lineup

1260
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:29,792
through all his years of contacts in NYPD.

1261
01:34:29,958 --> 01:34:32,500
The kind of man
who could've killed Edie finneran.

1262
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:40,250
She was found yesterday
at a hotel in Pennsylvania,

1263
01:34:40,417 --> 01:34:42,292
shot twice in the head.

1264
01:34:47,167 --> 01:34:48,847
What do you think
about Keaton now, verbal?

1265
01:34:51,167 --> 01:34:52,208
Edie?

1266
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:54,055
He used all of
you to get him on that boat.

1267
01:34:54,542 --> 01:34:58,042
He couldn't get on alone.
He had to pull the trigger himself

1268
01:34:58,208 --> 01:34:59,958
to make sure he got his man,

1269
01:35:00,125 --> 01:35:02,083
the one man that could identify him.

1270
01:35:03,125 --> 01:35:04,625
This is all bullshit.

1271
01:35:05,167 --> 01:35:06,542
You said you saw him die.

1272
01:35:09,583 --> 01:35:10,583
Or did you?

1273
01:35:10,917 --> 01:35:13,000
You had to hide
when you first heard the police cars.

1274
01:35:13,167 --> 01:35:15,875
You said you heard the shot
before the fire,

1275
01:35:16,042 --> 01:35:17,500
but you didn't see him die.

1276
01:35:18,333 --> 01:35:20,833
- I knew him. He would never...
- He programmed you.

1277
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,833
He programmed you to tell us
just what he wanted you to.

1278
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,042
He knew we were close,
you said it yourself.

1279
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,968
Where was the political pressure
coming from?

1280
01:35:28,042 --> 01:35:30,458
Why were you being protected?
It was Keaton.

1281
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:34,000
- Immunity was your reward.
- But why me?

1282
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,625
Why not fenster or McManus or hockney?

1283
01:35:36,792 --> 01:35:39,292
Why me? I'm stupid, I'm a cripple.
Why me?

1284
01:35:39,458 --> 01:35:40,875
Because you're a cripple, verbal.

1285
01:35:41,417 --> 01:35:42,708
Because you're stupid.

1286
01:35:43,375 --> 01:35:44,875
Because you're weaker than them.

1287
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:50,708
If he's dead,

1288
01:35:51,333 --> 01:35:54,625
if what you say is true,
then it won't matter.

1289
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:59,583
It was his idea to hit the taxi service
in New York, wasn't it?

1290
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:02,833
- Come on, tell me the truth.
- It was all Keaton.

1291
01:36:04,208 --> 01:36:06,958
We followed him from the beginning.

1292
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:09,708
I didn't know.

1293
01:36:10,167 --> 01:36:12,125
I saw him die.

1294
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:15,958
I believe he's dead. Oh, Christ.

1295
01:36:17,083 --> 01:36:18,458
You're not safe on your own.

1296
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:24,000
You think he's...

1297
01:36:24,417 --> 01:36:26,000
Keyser soze?

1298
01:36:26,792 --> 01:36:27,875
I don't know, verbal.

1299
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:32,958
Keyser soze's a shield,
or like you said, a spook story.

1300
01:36:34,958 --> 01:36:38,625
But I know Keaton, and someone
is out there pulling strings for you.

1301
01:36:39,333 --> 01:36:42,875
- Stay here and let us protect you.
- No way, I'm not bait. I post today.

1302
01:36:43,042 --> 01:36:44,417
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1303
01:36:45,042 --> 01:36:47,167
Captain Leo wants you out of here asap,

1304
01:36:47,375 --> 01:36:50,208
- unless you turn state's.
- I'll take my chances, thank you.

1305
01:36:50,667 --> 01:36:53,917
If someone wants to get you,
they're gonna get you out there.

1306
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:57,500
Turn state's evidence.
You might never see trial.

1307
01:36:57,917 --> 01:36:59,167
Maybe so.

1308
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:03,083
But I'm not a rat, agent kujan.

1309
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:20,792
Fucking cops.

1310
01:37:45,417 --> 01:37:47,750
Excuse me, can I use your fax machine?

1311
01:37:51,875 --> 01:37:54,500
You'll have to sign for these, Mr. Kint.

1312
01:37:56,708 --> 01:37:58,292
One watch, gold.

1313
01:37:58,792 --> 01:38:00,917
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1314
01:38:01,792 --> 01:38:03,750
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1315
01:38:04,375 --> 01:38:06,042
We've still got nothing, Dave.

1316
01:38:06,792 --> 01:38:08,875
I know what I wanted to know
about Keaton.

1317
01:38:09,042 --> 01:38:10,667
Which is nothing.

1318
01:38:11,167 --> 01:38:14,333
No matter.
He'll have to know how close we came.

1319
01:38:15,292 --> 01:38:18,042
Keyser soze or no keyser soze,

1320
01:38:18,208 --> 01:38:21,125
if Keaton is alive,
he's not coming up again.

1321
01:38:21,625 --> 01:38:23,125
I'll find him.

1322
01:38:23,833 --> 01:38:25,333
Waste of time.

1323
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:30,167
A rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die.

1324
01:38:31,042 --> 01:38:32,167
What?

1325
01:38:33,042 --> 01:38:34,083
Nothing.

1326
01:38:36,083 --> 01:38:37,917
Man, you're a slob.

1327
01:38:38,083 --> 01:38:40,625
Yeah, but it all has a system, Dave.

1328
01:38:41,292 --> 01:38:42,684
It all makes sense
when you look at it right.

1329
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:44,917
You gotta like stand back from it,
you know?

1330
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,125
You wanna see a real horror show?
See my garage.

1331
01:39:27,417 --> 01:39:29,625
Convince me and tell me every last detail.

1332
01:39:29,792 --> 01:39:32,351
You know, back when I was in that
barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois...

1333
01:39:32,375 --> 01:39:33,750
Where's your head, agent kujan?

1334
01:39:33,917 --> 01:39:36,083
What we need to do is think. Think back.

1335
01:39:36,458 --> 01:39:37,976
I'm sure you've heard many tall tales.

1336
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,458
- Bricks marlin.
- This isn't right.

1337
01:39:39,625 --> 01:39:41,684
I just wanna hear your story.
Tell me every last detail.

1338
01:39:41,708 --> 01:39:43,643
It's all there.
And I'm telling it straight, iswear.

1339
01:39:43,667 --> 01:39:45,387
Some guy in California,
his name is redfoot.

1340
01:39:45,458 --> 01:39:48,000
- A gift from Mr. Soze.
- Talk to me, verbal.

1341
01:39:48,167 --> 01:39:50,917
- What about redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

1342
01:39:51,083 --> 01:39:54,125
- Using pawns...
- A big fat guy. I mean, like, orca fat.

1343
01:39:54,292 --> 01:39:56,042
- There was a lawyer.
- Myths, legends.

1344
01:39:56,208 --> 01:39:57,625
Kobayashi.

1345
01:39:58,083 --> 01:39:59,917
Back when I was picking beans
in Guatemala,

1346
01:40:00,083 --> 01:40:01,458
we used to make fresh coffee.

1347
01:40:01,625 --> 01:40:03,105
I know you thought he was a good man.

1348
01:40:03,208 --> 01:40:04,375
I know he was good.

1349
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:09,833
- You tell me every last detail.
- The strangest thing.

1350
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,560
How do you shoot the devil in the back?

1351
01:40:11,708 --> 01:40:14,333
Is protected from up on high
by the prince of...

1352
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:15,540
Tell me every last detail.

1353
01:40:15,625 --> 01:40:17,309
What about it, pretzel man?
What's your story?

1354
01:40:17,333 --> 01:40:19,292
- There was a lawyer.
- What lawyer, verbal?

1355
01:40:19,458 --> 01:40:20,500
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

1356
01:40:20,667 --> 01:40:24,000
- Kobayashi. Kobayashi.
- Tell me every last detail.

1357
01:40:24,167 --> 01:40:27,125
- I work for keyser soze.
- Convince me. Convince me.

1358
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:45,500
Every creep and scumbag
that works the street for a living

1359
01:40:45,667 --> 01:40:47,292
will know the name of verbal kint.

1360
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,625
The cripple, did you see him?

1361
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:52,792
- The cripple! Which way did he go?
- Oh. He went out that way.

1362
01:40:52,958 --> 01:40:55,458
I know you know something.
I know you're not telling.

1363
01:40:55,625 --> 01:40:57,625
I'm smarter than you
and I'm gonna find out

1364
01:40:57,792 --> 01:40:59,184
what I wanna know
whether you like it or not.

1365
01:40:59,208 --> 01:41:01,684
To a cop, the explanation is never
that complicated. It's always simple.

1366
01:41:01,708 --> 01:41:03,226
You know what I'm getting at, verbal.
The truth!

1367
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:05,810
There's no mystery to the street,
no arch-criminal behind it all.

1368
01:41:06,083 --> 01:41:08,958
Somebody with power, somebody
who's capable of tracking us...

1369
01:41:09,125 --> 01:41:11,458
- Keyser soze!
- It's keyser soze.

1370
01:41:11,625 --> 01:41:14,875
You think a guy like that
comes this close to getting caught

1371
01:41:15,042 --> 01:41:16,125
and sticks his head out?

1372
01:41:16,792 --> 01:41:17,792
Keyser...

1373
01:41:17,833 --> 01:41:20,583
Because you're stupid, verbal.
Because you're a cripple.

1374
01:41:20,750 --> 01:41:22,101
What I wanna know is, who's the gimp?

1375
01:41:22,125 --> 01:41:24,417
You've known,
you've known the whole fucking time.

1376
01:41:24,583 --> 01:41:25,583
How do I know that?

1377
01:41:25,667 --> 01:41:27,601
If he comes up for anything,
it'll be to get rid of me.

1378
01:41:27,625 --> 01:41:28,875
I'm sure Keaton is dead.

1379
01:41:29,042 --> 01:41:32,167
I can't feel my legs, keyser.

1380
01:41:32,333 --> 01:41:34,708
First thing I learned on the job,
you know what it was?

1381
01:41:34,875 --> 01:41:35,875
How to spot a murderer.

1382
01:41:36,042 --> 01:41:37,976
They tell me you got the cripple in there
from New York

1383
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,917
- yeah.
- Did he mention keyser soze?

1384
01:41:40,083 --> 01:41:41,292
Who?

1385
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:43,000
After that,

1386
01:41:43,458 --> 01:41:45,542
my guess is
you'll never hear from him again.

1387
01:42:06,792 --> 01:42:09,292
The greatest trick the devil ever pulled

1388
01:42:09,458 --> 01:42:12,167
was convincing the world he didn't exist.

1389
01:42:14,167 --> 01:42:15,167
And like that,

1390
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:17,792
he's gone.
