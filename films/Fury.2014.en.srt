1
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,855
<i>They're taking fire from the woods.
They're waiting for the tanks.</i>

2
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:24,358
<i>Enemy fire from our right flank.
I say again, our right flank.</i>

3
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:32,533
<i>Princess Red 6 for Culture.</i>

4
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:35,411
<i>Hold fast.
This is the worst of it, boys. Over.</i>

5
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,705
<i>Sergeant Humphrey just showed up.</i>

6
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,791
<i>Have you any information on the right flank?</i>

7
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,629
<i>Culture, that's a negative. Move.</i>

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,885
<i>This is Able 2. The 88 is in that church.
They threw one at us when we drove by.</i>

9
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,653
<i>Negative. It's all over!</i>

10
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,408
<i>Come in, come in.</i>

11
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:19,121
<i>Do you read me? Do you read me?</i>

12
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,316
Son of a bitch!

13
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,702
Did you get that fucker?

14
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,206
Knocked him off.

15
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,388
Gordo, stop. Leave him rest.

16
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:07,933
Gordo, he's dead.

17
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,562
He's dead! Show some respect.

18
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,397
Leave him alone.

19
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,235
He's your fault!

20
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,237
God damn it. Ain't you done yet?

21
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:23,699
You got no right to be fucking sore with me.
Quit fucking riding me.

22
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,619
I ain't riding you.
If I was riding you, you'd know it.

23
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,245
More where he came from.

24
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,748
Hey, fuck you, Don!
It's your fucking fault we here.

25
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,083
Are you still talking?
Let's get out of here.

26
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,295
Fuck! What the fuck you do that for?

27
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,380
- I'm trying to fix it!
- You know why.

28
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:39,965
You want to fucking whup me?

29
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,634
It ain't gonna fucking help anything!

30
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:44,845
Probate, Fox 6.

31
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:47,264
I say, why you always whupping on me?

32
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,225
'Cause you're an animal, a dog.

33
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,893
All you understand is the fist and boot.

34
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,853
Don, I'm telling you right now,
don't fucking call me that.

35
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:54,772
I ain't a fucking animal. I ain't a fucking dog.

36
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,025
Hey, you want to talk Mexican,

37
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,194
join another tank, a Mexican tank.

38
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,446
This is an American tank, we talk American.

39
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,823
Who put the fucking nickel in you, top?

40
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,492
You talk Kraut!

41
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,410
You talk German! I can't talk Spanish?

42
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:10,037
- Bible, what country we in?
- Germany.

43
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,872
Germany, they speak German.

44
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:16,418
- Could you explain to him it's a tool of war?
- It's a tool of war, Gordo.

45
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,462
Here's my tool of war.

46
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:19,755
Top.

47
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,132
You knew German
before we got in this fucking war!

48
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,884
Don't play stupid with me.

49
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,762
I expect all of you to pull your shit together.

50
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,932
I wish you'd stop ragging on everyone.

51
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:31,684
You didn't kill Red, Germans did.

52
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,520
That is true, but I didn't save him, either.

53
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,022
His number came up, that's all.

54
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:38,899
We've been lucky till now.

55
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:41,110
- We've been lucky?
- Yes, sir.

56
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,697
- We're all alive. We're in here.
- God's grace?

57
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,300
Rain's coming.

58
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:12,057
Coon-Ass, anytime, sweetheart.

59
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,935
I'm your sweetheart, right?

60
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:18,355
Okay. Gordo, crank her up.

61
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,651
Choke her up. She's cold.

62
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:24,028
There's condensation on the plugs.

63
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:27,448
Fuckers!

64
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,786
All right, move out. Get us out of here.

65
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,751
Bible, gun front.

66
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:40,210
Roger.

67
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:32,489
Come on, move it!

68
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:35,576
Get those cases out of here!

69
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,672
I thought you were dead.

70
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,677
Devil watches over his own. Binkowski.

71
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,387
Good to see you.

72
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,181
Don, glad you made it back.

73
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,767
Crew still together? Nate? Lindburgh?

74
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,893
Doing well.

75
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,520
Good.

76
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,860
- Grab his arm.
- Here you go.

77
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,195
Okay.

78
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,821
Lay him down. Lay him down.

79
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,698
Move.

80
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,661
Set him down soft.

81
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,541
Sergeant.

82
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,212
Sergeant.

83
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,048
Lift.

84
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,262
Where's the rest of Third Platoon?

85
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,558
We're it.

86
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:48,982
Hey, Boyd?

87
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:52,528
Hey, Boyd, they...
They gonna send him home, right?

88
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,613
I don't know that, Grady.

89
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:59,201
Red's got us all a little sad right now,
but we got a job to do.

90
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:03,831
Grady, restock ammo and rations.
Gordo, water and gas.

91
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,835
Boyd, get some chow and do what you can
about the mechanical issues.

92
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:11,255
We can't do shit about mechanical issues.
Where you going?

93
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,637
First Sergeant Collier?

94
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,639
Maybe. What the fuck are you?

95
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,765
Private Ellison.

96
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:07,686
I was told to report to you.
I'm your new assistant driver.

97
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,399
No, you are not.

98
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,652
- Yes, yes, I am.
- God damn it.

99
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:17,946
Who told you this?

100
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,573
Master Sergeant with the clipboard.

101
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,991
- Bullshit!
- Right there. He's...

102
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,163
What's your name?

103
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,749
Norman.

104
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,381
How long you been in the Army?

105
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,092
Eight weeks.

106
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,263
That's home.

107
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,682
Do as you're told.

108
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,685
Don't get too close to anyone.

109
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,819
<i>On a hill far away.</i>

110
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,740
<i>Stood an old rugged cross.</i>

111
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,911
<i>The emblem of suffering and shame.</i>

112
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,248
<i>I love the old cross.</i>

113
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,876
<i>Where the dearest...</i>

114
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,296
<i>I will cling to the old rugged cross.</i>

115
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,049
Hi. Hi. I'm Norman.

116
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:29,226
Which... Which way is the front?

117
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,020
"Which way is the front?"

118
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,859
All around us, kid, 'cause this is Germany.
We're surrounded by Krauts.

119
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,945
Ain't that right, Grady?

120
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,571
That's right.

121
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,331
Can I please have my book back?

122
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,250
Where are the cigarettes?

123
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,876
I don't smoke.

124
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,670
You're a bastard.

125
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:58,839
You go to tank school?

126
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,173
Tank school? No.

127
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,719
I've never even seen the inside of a tank.

128
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,178
I'm a clerk typist.

129
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,390
Was heading to Fifth Corps HQ,
they pulled me off the truck.

130
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,933
They sent me here.

131
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:14,229
- It's got to be a mistake.
- Mistake?

132
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,857
Army don't make mistakes.

133
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,358
It wouldn't do.

134
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:20,110
You from Missouri?

135
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,612
No.

136
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,407
- Are you from Chicago?
- You from Arkansas, ain't you?

137
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,908
- No, I'm from Pittsburgh...
- Hey, hush up, man.

138
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,994
Nobody gives a fuck where you from.

139
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:32,831
Are you a praying man?

140
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,375
I go to church.

141
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,129
Which denomination are you? Episcopalian?

142
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,631
Yeah, you are. You're a Mainliner, ain't you?

143
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,717
Yeah. I am.

144
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:45,886
Are you saved?

145
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,430
I'm baptized.

146
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:51,058
- That ain't what I asked you.
- That ain't what he asked you.

147
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,851
- Gordo, what'd I ask him?
- See, you got to listen.

148
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,144
- Say it again.
- "Are you saved?"

149
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,316
Wait until you see it.

150
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,568
See what?

151
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,615
What a man can do to another man.

152
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:09,826
Before you find Jesus,

153
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,412
why don't you come take a look at your seat?

154
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:14,372
That's where you're gonna be.

155
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:18,085
Get a bucket of hot water from the kitchen.
Get that shit clean.

156
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,284
Oh, fuck.

157
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:35,787
Fuck.

158
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,500
Weren't supposed to be no more Tigers, Don.

159
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,002
Tell my platoon that.

160
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,420
You send five tanks out.

161
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:44,754
One comes back.

162
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,590
It's hard to believe we're winning the war.

163
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:56,099
Stop talking about yesterday's fight.

164
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:58,101
Think about today's.

165
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:38,308
- Straighten out!
- Hey! What's an SS doing here?

166
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,229
Hey, why are you bringing him through here?

167
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,563
Why isn't he sleeping?

168
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,523
G2 wants a prisoner to question.

169
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,317
I'll question him.

170
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,735
What's your favourite colour?

171
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:49,945
Are you a good dancer?

172
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,154
Do you like fat girls?

173
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,989
- Get back!
- Beat his ass!

174
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,658
Stop! Stop it!

175
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,911
- Fucker!
- Fuck him up, Don!

176
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,454
Motherfucker!

177
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,581
Get the fuck... Get back!

178
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,334
- Go!
- Fucking tankers.

179
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,752
It's me, it's me.

180
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,420
You got MPs everywhere.
You got to stop now.

181
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,297
- Just stop.
- I spilled my fucking coffee.

182
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,174
- Cocksuckers.
- Come on, Grady.

183
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,051
Fucking SS.

184
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,137
- You good, top?
- Bring him through this camp...

185
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,724
You see that?

186
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:20,850
He's an SS.

187
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:23,186
You kill every last one you can.
They're real assholes.

188
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,188
Fuck every last one. They started it.

189
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,856
- We finishing it.
- That's it.

190
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,108
Done much killing?

191
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:29,818
No.

192
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:30,986
You will.

193
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,113
- Boys, take him through that gun.
- Roger.

194
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,031
- What do I do with this?
- "What..." Shut up.

195
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,241
Take a look at it.

196
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,450
- See that cover?
- Yeah.

197
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,535
Open it.

198
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,036
And now you killing.

199
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,371
Close it up.

200
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,123
Now you ain't.

201
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,794
Main unit's punching east.

202
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:51,131
We are going north on a flank guard mission.

203
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:54,175
We'll tie up with Baker Company
from the 41st.

204
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,469
Sergeant Collier's with us now.

205
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,431
- He'll be acting platoon sergeant.
- Fine by me.

206
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,433
Good to have you, Don.

207
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,565
We're meeting Baker Company here.

208
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,817
Then, together we'll take this town.

209
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:14,654
After that,
we're working for Captain Waggoner.

210
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:16,323
Any questions?

211
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,574
I got one question.

212
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,242
Peterson?

213
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,119
I'm Binkowski, sir.

214
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,123
You start shaving your face?

215
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,255
First Platoon, mount up! Move out!

216
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,722
War's not going anywhere, sir.

217
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,520
You heard him. Mount up!

218
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,208
Hey!

219
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,876
Go fuck yourself, Wardaddy!

220
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,712
- Coffee's too hot.
- Still owe me 40 bucks!

221
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,589
What'd he say?

222
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,716
Mount up! Let's go, gents.

223
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,884
Move front!

224
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,386
Motherfucker.

225
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:24,474
- Okay, guns ready.
- Good luck, gentlemen!

226
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,871
All right, there might be a wolf
hiding in the sheep.

227
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,998
Kid, you're up. Cast an eyeball on them.

228
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,584
<i>Anything that makes a move,
you cut them right in half.</i>

229
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:52,961
People are in the way, that's their problem.

230
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,546
You do what you got to do, copy?

231
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,298
<i>- Copy.</i>
- You copy?

232
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,051
I copy.

233
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,595
Gordo, talk him through that gun again.

234
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,847
<i>Roger.</i>

235
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,141
Hey, gun's ready. Just pull the trigger.

236
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,852
Every five rounds is a tracer so
you can see what you're hitting.

237
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,896
And remember, short bursts.

238
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,274
That way you harvest more meat per bullet.

239
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,197
The Americans are over there.

240
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,409
Keep moving.

241
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,873
Keep your hands up.

242
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,155
She'll let you fuck her for a chocolate bar.

243
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,240
That's not true.

244
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:05,533
It's not true?

245
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:06,784
No.

246
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,328
Okay. It's not true.

247
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:10,288
It's completely fucking true.

248
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,873
<i>Or just give her some smokes.</i>

249
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,958
You ain't got to fuck around
and give her a whole pack, neither.

250
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,793
- Norman, ignore him.
- Fucking four will do it.

251
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:19,172
Don't disappoint Christ, now.
Don't let them lead you astray.

252
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,674
You see, we can kill them,
but we can't fuck them,

253
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:23,134
<i>'cause it says so in the Bible.</i>

254
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:24,677
Stop, all right?

255
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,137
I'm done trying to convert you heathens.

256
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,264
You mind if I continue invading Germany?

257
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,683
Boyd, do you think Jesus loves Hitler?

258
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,769
Do I think Jesus loves Hitler?

259
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,521
I'd assume so.

260
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,857
If Hitler accepted Jesus into his heart
and got baptized, he'd be saved.

261
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,567
It ain't gonna save him from man's justice.

262
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:41,319
What about your regular-issue
Nazi line trooper?

263
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,279
- No, I'm not gonna do this with you.
- Is he going to Heaven?

264
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,240
We've been talking about the
same dumb shit for three years.

265
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:47,200
You know how I stand on it.
You trying to rile me up now.

266
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,786
Hey, what about me, huh?
You think you could save me?

267
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,037
<i>Sing me a hymn?</i>

268
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,456
- Yeah, sure.
- Sing <i>Old Rugged Cross.</i>

269
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,541
I like the way your mouth
moves when you sing.

270
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:55,667
- Don't.
- I like it.

271
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,002
- I'll sing it if you don't do that.
- Let me just touch your moustache.

272
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,671
- Don't touch me. Stop!
- I just wanna touch your moustache.

273
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,589
Why does that bother you so much
when I touch your moustache?

274
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:03,424
- I'll shoot you, I swear!
- All right, knock it off.

275
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:04,884
Knock off the horseplay.

276
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:11,641
Boyd, do you think Hitler'd fuck
one of us for a chocolate bar?

277
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,686
I hope so.

278
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:04,736
Ambush! Right!

279
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:06,154
Right side, ambush!

280
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,073
Fuck! Grady!

281
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,784
You watch that tree line!
We're ripe for an ambush!

282
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:13,953
Grady, cover right!

283
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,043
Father!

284
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:30,970
- What'd you see, Boyd?
- Just go out and blast them little fuckers!

285
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,140
- What'd you see?
- I didn't see nothing.

286
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:58,706
Norman!

287
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,126
You cocksucker.
Why didn't you take the shot?

288
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,753
He was just a kid. I'm sorry.

289
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,588
I'm really sorry, Sergeant.

290
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,675
You see what a kid can do?

291
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,593
Look!

292
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:11,844
That's your fault.

293
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,680
That's your fucking fault.

294
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,557
Next German you see with a weapon,
you rake the dog shit out of him.

295
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:18,601
I don't care if
it's a baby with a butter knife in one hand

296
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,686
and mama's titty in the other.

297
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:20,978
- You chop him up!
- Yes, Sergeant!

298
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,693
- Bible?
- Yeah?

299
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:39,288
All tanks, Wardaddy.

300
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,167
Looks like I'm it.

301
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:47,964
I'll lead the column.
Let's get us where we're going.

302
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:03,479
We have this thing set up and on the way.

303
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:07,108
I sent over a couple men to keep contact,
and the officers have been briefed.

304
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,696
Stop right here, Gordo.

305
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,242
- Baker Company?
- Yes, sir!

306
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:17,744
I'm not a sir.

307
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:18,995
Me, neither.

308
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:20,913
- Where's your boss?
- Dead.

309
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,584
Who's in charge of this column?

310
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:27,003
- I am.
- Good. I'm talking to the right man.

311
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:29,380
Park it over there. Old Man's waiting.

312
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,317
Yes, thank you, sir,

313
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,611
don't tell me how long
my casualties can last.

314
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,070
Unless you want to come down here,

315
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,448
stand knee-deep in their guts
and form an opinion.

316
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,699
Baker 6 out.

317
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,785
Pencil-pushing motherfucker.
How you doing?

318
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:00,369
Load the casualties into a truck.

319
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,455
We're gonna drive them
back to base ourselves.

320
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,664
Take care of our own. Come with me.

321
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,584
Hey, wake up!

322
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,128
All right, how many tanks we got?

323
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:10,338
Four.

324
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:12,548
Four? You're shitting me.

325
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:15,843
I asked for 10.

326
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,846
Miles! Sergeant Miles!

327
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,057
- Yes, sir?
- Get First Platoon ready.

328
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:22,975
You're working for him now.

329
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,602
If they can stand, they're in play.

330
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,938
- Roger.
- All right, here's the deal.

331
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:29,482
I got a platoon trapped
in this beet field by machine guns.

332
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:30,608
I sent my tracks in.

333
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:32,693
Jerry took them out.

334
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:36,405
So, anti-tank guns there, there,
possibly there, I don't know.

335
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,449
I need you to rescue my guys.

336
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:39,867
Take the guns out.

337
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:41,494
I can do that.

338
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:44,664
All right, that clears this road into town,
you push forward.

339
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,207
I'll join you there. We'll clear it up.

340
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,668
Maybe they'll surrender.
Or maybe they'll fight.

341
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:51,921
This high ground, you got any eyes on it?

342
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,715
I had eyes there, gone. There, gone.

343
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:57,468
We're flying blind. It's you and me.

344
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:00,513
Krauts got sights on this road.
I don't want to show my flank.

345
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,014
Any objection if I come in here?

346
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:04,892
You can arrive on a fucking magic carpet,
for all I care.

347
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:08,062
I know who you are.
I know you know what you're doing.

348
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,274
You just paste them hard for me.

349
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:14,318
They murdered
some good boys out there today.

350
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,657
Why don't they just quit?

351
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,287
Would you?

352
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:27,290
We got a platoon pinned down
in this field by MGs.

353
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,625
Krauts got anti-tank covering the field.

354
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,377
And once we cross this hedgerow,

355
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,297
we will be in range and in their line of sight,
so be alert.

356
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,965
Hit anything that fucking moves.

357
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,258
Yeah, unless they pound us first.

358
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,634
If they do, we'll know exactly where they are.

359
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,471
Let's get these boys out of there
and smash those guns.

360
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:46,434
Then we'll capture the town,
stop for the night. Clear?

361
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:49,395
Why are we rescuing kittens
instead of just driving down into Berlin?

362
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,314
- Why are you such an asshole?
- That's a great question.

363
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:56,360
March order.
Fury, Old Phyllis, Lucy Sue, Murder Inc.

364
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:57,987
Let's go.

365
00:28:58,654 --> 00:28:59,989
All right, fuck sticks.

366
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:02,199
- Mount up! By squad!
- All right, mount up!

367
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,743
<i>All tanks, comm check.</i>

368
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:04,785
<i>1-4's up.</i>

369
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,162
<i>Love 1-3 copies.</i>

370
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:08,623
- That's right, man.
- Need you to hold tight!

371
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:21,719
All tanks, Wardaddy.

372
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,554
When we hit open ground, line up on me.

373
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,431
<i>Keep your spacing, don't bunch up.</i>

374
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:28,726
<i>On my signal, we'll drop
the doughs and roll up that 75.</i>

375
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,103
<i>- Everyone copy?</i>
- Love 1 -5 copies. Wilco.

376
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,064
- Copy.
<i>- Love 1-3 copies.</i>

377
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,108
<i>Gordo, halt.</i>

378
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,111
<i>All tanks halt. All tanks halt.</i>

379
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,622
All right, let's get the boys off.
Get them off. Give me last man.

380
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:50,915
- All right, ladies, you heard the man.
<i>- Button up.</i>

381
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,041
Everybody off!

382
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,793
Move out! Move! Everybody off!

383
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:55,544
Close your hatch.

384
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,470
<i>All tanks, move out. Hard right. Hard right.</i>

385
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,514
<i>- Move them out.
- Hard right. Hard right.</i>

386
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,099
<i>Fury's going. Let's go.</i>

387
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:09,725
<i>Move, move, move, move, move.</i>

388
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:13,354
Let's move now. A hard stick right.

389
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,940
Everybody hold yourself. Jiggs, hold on.

390
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,525
Form in. Form in.

391
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:19,777
<i>- Catch up with the Fury.
- Stick right.</i>

392
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,861
<i>Now, catch up.</i>

393
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,489
- On my line, guys, on my line.
<i>- More gas. More gas.</i>

394
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,032
Mix it up.

395
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:26,409
- Keep them low!
<i>- Hold your line.</i>

396
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,160
<i>We're already drifting.</i>

397
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,621
Binkowski, keep an eyeball
on that high ground. Right.

398
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:32,164
<i>Love 1-5 copies. Wilco.</i>

399
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,083
<i>Watch that tree line right there.</i>

400
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,584
<i>Hold that, hold that.</i>

401
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:43,968
<i>- Ride on, ride on.</i>
- Hold tight.

402
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,344
We're gonna bust through this shit.

403
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:46,846
All right, here we go, men.

404
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,222
<i>Left stick, left stick. What the fuck?</i>

405
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,974
<i>- It looks perfect, Tim.</i>
- Good?

406
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,100
Straight on, straight on.

407
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,476
<i>Doughs on the ground,
doughs on the ground.</i>

408
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,561
<i>Keep an eye out.</i>

409
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,187
- Straight, straight.
- Over here!

410
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:57,732
<i>Gordo, slow, slow, slow.</i>

411
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,275
We got bodies.

412
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,402
- Stick left of me.
<i>- Eyes on the floor.</i>

413
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,863
- Get up.
- Fall in! Fall in!

414
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,281
Straighten it out.

415
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:08,034
<i>- Watch your fucking spacing.
- You gotta left stick now.</i>

416
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,243
All right, let's hold up.

417
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,370
If I say hold back, hold back. Hold back.

418
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:13,205
- Left stick. Left stick. What the fuck?
- Come on!

419
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:14,790
Company, clear on the right.

420
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,917
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Clear it up and book it.

421
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:19,712
Speed up just a little bit.

422
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:23,424
Love 1 -3, right stick! Right stick!
You got troops on the ground.

423
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,801
<i>Fuck, right stick! Right stick, God damn it!</i>

424
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,430
- Get your head out of your ass!
- They weren't fucking paying attention.

425
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,808
Get in tight. Go!

426
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,522
Down! Stay down! Down!

427
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,651
What the fuck is that?

428
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:46,447
Bible, hit that machine gun.

429
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,616
Traverse left, 800!

430
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:51,535
- Steady!
- On. Fire!

431
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:52,703
On the way!

432
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:54,872
<i>Good! Hit them! Hit them!</i>

433
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:00,461
Look forward! Look at your periscope!

434
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,713
- Bible, traverse back. On.
- Periscope!

435
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,173
- Clear!
- Fire!

436
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,508
On the way!

437
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:09,678
<i>Cease fire. Target destroyed.</i>

438
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,056
<i>Roger, Ester, Wilco.</i>

439
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:13,599
Fire!

440
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,186
Fuck! Anti-tank! H.E.! Traverse left.

441
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:19,438
<i>Let's go. Traverse left.</i>

442
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:20,773
Traverse left!

443
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,532
Just a ricochet. We're okay.

444
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,867
Bullshit! That's a Kraut high-velocity gun.
I can hear it whistling.

445
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:34,829
<i>Anti-tank! Left front, left front!</i>

446
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:36,330
Got it! Down 15.

447
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:37,873
- Clear!
<i>- Ready!</i>

448
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,583
- Fire!
- On the way!

449
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:44,713
600.

450
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:47,049
Fire!

451
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:48,634
- Clear!
- On the way!

452
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,264
Okay, cease fire, cease fire. Target destroyed.

453
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:54,849
Fire!

454
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,852
There's another gun! Who's got eyes on it?

455
00:32:58,394 --> 00:32:59,395
Does anyone see it?

456
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:03,065
- Eyes up, everybody.
- Fire!

457
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,484
I don't see shit.

458
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,111
Where the fuck are you at?

459
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:08,362
<i>Anti-tank, H.E.</i>

460
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,656
Got it! Anti-tank, H.E. Traverse right!

461
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,825
Anti-tank. Left front, left front. 600.

462
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,327
<i>- Right stick, right stick.</i>
- On! Fire!

463
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:16,954
On the way!

464
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,123
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em.

465
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,086
Fire!

466
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:32,052
All tanks, start squirting that tree line.

467
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:33,179
Let's light them up. Let's go.

468
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:35,431
<i>- Everybody squirt the fucking tree line.</i>
- Let's clean it up.

469
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:43,689
Hey! Hey! Start shooting!

470
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:44,773
Well, what do I shoot at?

471
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:46,650
The Nazis, dumb fuck!

472
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,368
That's it. Keep their fucking heads down.

473
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,663
You got to reload!

474
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,211
- Panzerfaust!
- Hey! Get him!

475
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,837
- I'm loading the gun. I'm loading the gun.
- Hit him!

476
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:08,631
Got him.

477
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,221
Do your job! Do what you're here for!

478
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,305
I was loading the gun!

479
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,641
<i>Machine gun, twelve o'clock!
Gordo, run those bastards over!</i>

480
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,521
All tanks, hold here, hold here.

481
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,488
Get your boys in the fight!

482
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,699
Fall out! Marching fire!

483
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,497
Come on!

484
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,251
Hey, squirt those Krauts on the left.

485
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:46,627
Do you see them?

486
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:49,171
<i>Will Actual, come in. This is Vicious.</i>

487
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:50,547
<i>Krauts in the woods to your...</i>

488
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:51,799
All I see are dead bodies.

489
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,676
How do you know they're dead?
Are you a doctor?

490
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:54,760
- Hit them!
- But they're dead!

491
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,178
Why would I shoot them
if they're already dead?

492
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,472
So they don't stand up
and shoot us in the ass!

493
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,182
- Fuck!
- Get them!

494
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:01,267
Fuck!

495
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:04,687
I can't fucking be here any-fucking-more!

496
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,940
Turn your goddamn intercom off
if you're gonna bawl like that.

497
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,316
I got it, top.

498
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:15,572
I fucking give up. I fucking give up.
I can't be here any more.

499
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,533
This ain't pretty, you know.

500
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,076
This is what we do.

501
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:22,621
- Boys, fight on foot.
- You take it.

502
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:30,170
I'm okay.

503
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,840
You're all right.

504
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:16,925
Close your eyes, son. Close your eyes, son.

505
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,385
Do you believe in Jesus?

506
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,929
You're all right, then. You're all right, then.

507
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:23,098
I'm gonna pray with you now.

508
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:29,396
Our father, Lord in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

509
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:33,817
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

510
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,653
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

511
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:39,615
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

512
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,159
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

513
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:45,871
For the kingdom, the power and the glory,
forever and ever, dear Lord.

514
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,122
Amen.

515
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:59,551
I had the best bow gunner
in the entire Ninth Army in that seat.

516
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:03,013
And now I got you.

517
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:08,435
I promised my crew a long time ago
I'd keep them alive.

518
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,606
You're getting in the way of that.

519
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:14,024
I'm sorry.

520
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:18,320
Okay, I am trained to type 60 words a minute.

521
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:21,573
I am not trained to machine-gun dead bodies.

522
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,659
I am trying my very best.

523
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:28,497
Where'd you get that U.S. Army coat?
Where'd you get it?

524
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:31,250
Who'd you kill, boy?

525
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,377
Where did you get that coat, boy?

526
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:35,170
Forgive me. Let me go, please.

527
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:39,174
Who did you kill? What'd you do?

528
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:41,093
Don't shoot!

529
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,177
Let me go, please, let me go.

530
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,804
- Who'd you kill, boy?
- Sergeant!

531
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,931
- Back it up, boys!
- Hold on. Hold on!

532
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,183
- Back it up, boys.
- Back it up, boys.

533
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:49,393
Norman!

534
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:51,145
Get out here!

535
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,153
Norman, come here.

536
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:02,990
Come on, son.

537
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,963
- I can't hear you.
- Wait.

538
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,007
Sergeant. Call your dogs off.

539
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:23,802
I have a family.

540
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:25,888
This is my wife, my children.

541
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:27,556
Shut your mouth.

542
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:32,561
Kneel.

543
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,573
You are no goddamn good to me
unless you can kill Krauts.

544
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:48,076
Put a big fat hole in his back.

545
00:38:49,912 --> 00:38:52,498
Put a big fat hole in his fucking back.

546
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,168
No.

547
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,628
Why the hell not?

548
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:00,255
It's not right.

549
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,635
"Not right"?
We're not here for right and wrong.

550
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,094
We're here to kill them.

551
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,180
Why are you here?

552
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:09,515
You're here to kill him.

553
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:11,475
You know why he's here?

554
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,853
He's here to kill you.

555
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:16,563
He's here to kill you, Norman.

556
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:17,981
He's here to rip your throat out with a bullet.

557
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,316
Go to hell.

558
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:29,284
I'm trying to teach you something.

559
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,204
You here to get me killed?

560
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,580
- No.
- You gonna get me killed?

561
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,791
- No.
- I need you to perform.

562
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,046
Just get it over with. Just get it over with.

563
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,756
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.

564
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:43,882
I know you can.

565
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:46,009
He kills you, or you kill him.

566
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,511
Simple math.

567
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,221
You or him. Pick.

568
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,557
- Just kill me.
- Come here.

569
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,811
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Please!

570
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:58,313
I can't do it!

571
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,321
Fucking stop!

572
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,699
Please stop.

573
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,619
Oh, no, no. This is the easy part.

574
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:14,329
What the hell?

575
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,916
- All right.
- Fuck. Please don't make me do this.

576
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,251
Don't make me do this.

577
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:21,795
It's all right.

578
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,964
One, two...

579
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,845
Do it, Norman. Do it, Norman.

580
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,265
Do it, Norman.

581
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,525
Do your job.

582
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:45,360
Waddell, where you at?

583
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:54,870
- Waddell!
- Move it!

584
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:56,955
Move it!

585
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,094
Come on, Norman.

586
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,056
Let's go.

587
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,532
Is this supposed to make a man out of me?

588
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:36,703
Is this supposed to make a man out of me?
'Cause my conscience is...

589
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:37,996
- Sit down.
- It's clean.

590
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,665
My conscience is clean.

591
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,292
I'm keeping it that way.

592
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,378
Look right here. Hot coffee.

593
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:46,963
Norman?

594
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:05,065
Don might be crazier than a shit house rat,
but he's solid.

595
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,487
We've been together since before Africa.

596
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,198
I won't fight with anybody else.

597
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:15,033
Me, neither.

598
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:18,829
There ain't no crew stayed
together like we have, Norman.

599
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:21,289
That's 'cause of him.

600
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:29,631
First time we got shot at,
down in North Africa,

601
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:33,468
Don, he done shit his drawers full.

602
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:36,388
He stunk the tank up real loud.

603
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:38,265
It's true.

604
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,439
We move out in 15.

605
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:50,402
Norman.

606
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:55,490
I haven't seen you eat anything all day.
Make sure you get something to eat.

607
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:02,998
You best go eat something.

608
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,877
Make sure he sees it, too.

609
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:45,332
There you go, boys. Keep pounding them.

610
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:32,337
They got signs around their necks.
What do them signs say?

611
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:36,883
"I'm a coward and refused
to fight for the German people."

612
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:38,468
The SS does that.

613
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:41,012
Let them rip themselves to pieces, huh?

614
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,639
Fuck them.

615
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:51,022
<i>Baker 6. Love 1-6.</i>

616
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:53,775
<i>I got eyes on the town.
We're ready to commence assault.</i>

617
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:56,361
<i>Baker 6 copies. Initiate your attack.</i>

618
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,614
<i>Me and my boys will hit them from the south.
Over and out.</i>

619
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,534
<i>We'll split up here. 1-4, 1-3, you take left.</i>

620
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:05,161
<i>Binkowski, you follow me,
and stay off my ass.</i>

621
00:45:05,287 --> 00:45:06,371
Check the hotel.

622
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,123
- Come back.
<i>- Copy. I got you, Daddy.</i>

623
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:17,757
Clear the alley!

624
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,637
Keep moving, Tex.

625
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,681
<i>Go.</i>

626
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:27,225
<i>Gordo, just punch through
that wall of smoke.</i>

627
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:28,310
<i>Copy.</i>

628
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:31,396
Okay, hard left. Nine o'clock, nine o'clock.

629
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:00,383
Move up.

630
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,931
<i>- Gordo, halt, halt.</i>
- All right, hold here.

631
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:10,644
Grandpa.

632
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:12,437
Where are the German soldiers?

633
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,315
Sniper!

634
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:16,441
Cover!

635
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:17,859
Get down!

636
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:19,194
Bible, follow my burst.

637
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:25,659
On the way!

638
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:41,257
Keep firing on that window!

639
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:46,471
Come on! Move up!

640
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,182
Go!

641
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:50,517
Keep moving.

642
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:56,982
Keep moving.

643
00:46:57,816 --> 00:46:58,942
Come on, keep moving up.

644
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,568
Watch that doorway. Watch that doorway.

645
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:07,409
<i>Halt, halt, Gordo, halt.</i>

646
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:10,620
Binkowski, see that Kraut stinger in the cellar
on my left?

647
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:11,997
Mind giving him what for?

648
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,082
I'm gonna slap him around a little bit for you.

649
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:15,583
<i>Button up.</i>

650
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,255
Hit him!

651
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:23,967
Fuck you, Jerry!

652
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:27,262
God damn.

653
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:38,440
All right, Gordo, forward.

654
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:41,609
Fucking eyes up, everywhere we go.

655
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:46,156
<i>Gordo, hard right,
three o'clock into the square.</i>

656
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:48,491
<i>Binkowski, you take the far end.
You cover our tail.</i>

657
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:49,701
<i>Gotcha.</i>

658
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,926
Anti-tank. Traverse left.

659
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,429
<i>Throw some Willy Pete in that ground floor.</i>

660
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:11,556
Clear, Boyd.

661
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:14,017
<i>Fire when ready.</i>

662
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,405
No, they cooking. Go, go.

663
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,380
Good shooting, kid. Keep stacking them up.

664
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:46,716
You should've let them burn.

665
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:55,892
All right, look inside.

666
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:58,853
Check the doorways, y'all.

667
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:01,940
<i>Gordo, halt here.</i>

668
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:05,735
Please stop shooting!

669
00:49:06,528 --> 00:49:07,529
Come here.

670
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:10,073
The soldiers want to surrender.

671
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:12,826
We give up.

672
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:14,661
The war is over.

673
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:16,621
Thank God.

674
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:18,706
Tell them to come out

675
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:21,209
with their hands up.

676
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:23,294
Binkowski, load an H.E.

677
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:25,713
and get ready to put it
in that bank if these people want to test us.

678
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:27,465
It's my pleasure.

679
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:30,218
Check the door, check the door.

680
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:34,472
Fuck, it's a bunch of kids.

681
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:37,892
Cut him down! Separate them.

682
00:49:38,977 --> 00:49:39,978
Come on.

683
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:42,522
<i>Here they come. Keep an eye out.</i>

684
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:45,233
- Right over there!
- Let's go!

685
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,235
- Go. Go.
- Fuck.

686
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,909
Why you looking so sour, Kraut?
What you got?

687
00:49:55,368 --> 00:49:56,786
You. You.

688
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:57,912
Burgermeister.

689
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:01,207
Is he the one hanging kids?

690
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,376
Hey.

691
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:04,502
Shoot that guy.

692
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:05,837
- This guy?
- Yeah, him.

693
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,256
The SS cocksucker with the busted wing.

694
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:13,428
Hey, Angel. This one's yours.

695
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:16,598
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i> asshole.

696
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,975
Motherfucker.

697
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:41,372
Hey, you! You're real pretty.

698
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:44,167
Yo, what the fuck are you doing?

699
00:50:45,335 --> 00:50:47,420
- I'm gonna take care of you, okay?
- Okay.

700
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,047
You want to see the tank?

701
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,590
Hey, I'm gonna marry this girl.

702
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:52,884
It's gonna be for two.
Gonna be him, then me.

703
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,469
All right, you go on up there.

704
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:55,929
- That's it. Yeah.
- Give me your hand.

705
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:58,223
You boys all come through okay?

706
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,558
- Just a walk in the park.
- All right, Sergeant.

707
00:51:00,642 --> 00:51:03,394
You get some rest and relax.
We'll go win the war in the morning.

708
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:04,479
Yes, sir.

709
00:51:19,661 --> 00:51:20,954
Norman.

710
00:51:24,374 --> 00:51:26,376
It wasn't nothing, right?

711
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:28,878
Come again, Sergeant?

712
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:32,924
Rubbing out those Heinies.
You splashed them real good.

713
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:34,342
Wasn't nothing, right?

714
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,346
Sure, Sergeant.

715
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,474
Yeah, it wasn't nothing.

716
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:44,519
Fact, I kind of liked it.

717
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:50,692
I want to show you something.

718
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:19,387
They knew we were coming.

719
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:26,185
So they got drunk as lords
and they shot themselves at sunup.

720
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:30,023
Why are you showing me this?

721
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:36,070
Ideals are peaceful.

722
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,239
History is violent.

723
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,599
Do what I tell you.

724
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:09,062
You do that,
you'll make it through this thing.

725
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:18,946
Come on.

726
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:52,855
Who is inside?

727
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:55,191
Just me.

728
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:57,693
Bullshit.

729
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:13,084
Watch her.

730
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:32,854
Come out!

731
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,022
Right now!

732
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,024
Hey! Hey!

733
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:39,360
Come on. Calm down.

734
00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:41,154
Stand fucking here.

735
00:54:41,404 --> 00:54:43,156
Close the door and lock it.

736
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:44,782
Lock the fucking door.

737
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,371
You said no one was here.

738
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:53,541
You could have gotten her killed.

739
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:55,585
She's my cousin.

740
00:54:56,586 --> 00:54:57,587
I'm sorry,

741
00:54:57,753 --> 00:54:58,754
please.

742
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,590
I was scared.

743
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:01,841
Sit down.

744
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:34,624
Bring me hot water.

745
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:39,837
Go.

746
00:55:54,477 --> 00:55:55,603
Put the gun down.

747
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,898
Grab a seat. You make me nervous.

748
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,110
Come here.

749
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,982
What's your name, young lady?

750
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,113
Emma.

751
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:34,577
Hey.

752
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:02,813
Fuck! Grenade!

753
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:11,405
Get away from that window
before they shoot the hell out of you.

754
00:58:16,035 --> 00:58:18,287
Yeah! How was it, Gor?

755
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:20,998
It was good.

756
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:23,292
You get your ass up there, Boyd.

757
00:58:23,376 --> 00:58:25,461
- I hope you get scabies.
- Shit.

758
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:04,685
She's a good, clean girl.

759
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,648
If you don't take her in that bedroom, I will.

760
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:26,040
No.

761
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:29,877
They're young

762
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:34,089
and they're alive.

763
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:27,726
Can I see your hand? Can I see your hand?

764
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:31,564
I'm not gonna bite you. This hand.

765
01:01:32,273 --> 01:01:33,440
Yeah.

766
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:38,863
Now, you can tell a lot about a person
from the lines on their hand.

767
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:44,952
You don't know what I'm saying, do you?

768
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,497
All right, this, you see that?

769
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,167
That's the Ring of Solomon.

770
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:55,713
It means you help people,
you understand them.

771
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:57,464
It's really rare.

772
01:01:58,591 --> 01:01:59,800
Really rare. You see?

773
01:02:00,092 --> 01:02:01,635
You see that, though?

774
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:03,470
Yeah, I got it, too.

775
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,143
My grandma taught me how to do this.

776
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:11,937
You see this right here?

777
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,398
That is your heart line.

778
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:18,611
From the looks of this,

779
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:23,699
you are going to have one
great love in your life.

780
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:49,660
You don't have to say a word.

781
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,023
Sit down.

782
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:21,942
Thank you.

783
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:25,612
What's that?

784
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:29,700
It's hot.

785
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,869
- "It's hot"?
- Yeah, you just...

786
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:35,414
Normie! Nor?

787
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:37,708
Norman, where could you be?

788
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:40,627
Oh, shit.

789
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:42,212
<i>Pinche,</i> Norman!

790
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,173
- Norman?
<i>- Pinche,</i> Norman.

791
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:46,216
Time for you to act the man!

792
01:04:46,592 --> 01:04:48,218
We got you fixed up good.

793
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:49,470
Now, look, there a special gal.

794
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,430
She's down there and she's waiting on you.

795
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:52,848
And all you got to do is come on down.

796
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,308
She wide open just jump on in.

797
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:57,269
Yeah, she looks a little bit like a whore, but...

798
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:03,317
What?

799
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:05,861
I think maybe we too late, Gor.

800
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:07,488
Norman.

801
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:09,281
What did you do?

802
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:13,035
Norman, you sneaky snail.

803
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,037
What did you do?

804
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,082
Wait a second, did you...

805
01:05:18,624 --> 01:05:20,000
Did you...

806
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:24,171
Did you take this pretty
young thing for a roll?

807
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:25,923
Yeah, you're real pretty.

808
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:28,175
- Did you do that?
- What's with your lip?

809
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:29,760
What's with your lip? Why it quiver?

810
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:31,678
Don't worry about me, I'm a friend.

811
01:05:31,762 --> 01:05:33,639
He fuck you, you fuck me.
That how it works.

812
01:05:33,722 --> 01:05:34,848
You got to pass the plate.

813
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:36,850
Come on, make a donation to the cause.

814
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:38,769
- All right, don't touch her.
- Don't touch her?

815
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,562
- Don't touch her.
- Don't ever fucking tell me what to do.

816
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:43,273
You think you get some pussy
and now you can fucking act like a man?

817
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:46,193
Anyone touches the girl,
they get their teeth kicked in.

818
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,116
That's how it gonna be?

819
01:05:56,036 --> 01:05:57,204
Well, all right, then.

820
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:01,416
I guess it's Norman Day, huh?

821
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:06,880
Shit, top.

822
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:11,260
It's your day, Norman.

823
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:17,599
You should drink that.

824
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:19,434
You best take a bite.

825
01:06:19,518 --> 01:06:21,603
You a man, right? Drink it.

826
01:06:24,273 --> 01:06:25,941
- Attaboy.
- You did the nasty.

827
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,401
Drink it, there it is.

828
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:28,986
Your day.

829
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:30,279
There it is.

830
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:32,114
- You like that?
- Don't fucking touch me.

831
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:33,657
Don't touch you? You a man, right?

832
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:36,410
- Get some pussy, you a man, right?
- Get your fucking hands off me.

833
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,704
Fucking piece of shit.

834
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:41,165
Watch this. How about that?
How about I just kill you, huh?

835
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:42,875
How about I fucking kill you right here?

836
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:45,752
- Grady? Grady?
- Fuck. Don't you fucking speak...

837
01:06:46,295 --> 01:06:47,421
Oh, God!

838
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:50,424
- What the fuck is that? Gasoline?
- Taste like gasoline? Hey.

839
01:06:50,883 --> 01:06:53,427
Fucking north Georgia right there, boy.

840
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:55,053
Fuckup.

841
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:58,056
Donkey.

842
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,603
Appreciate it.

843
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:05,522
Look at that.

844
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:18,160
Go have a seat.

845
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,126
My beverage.

846
01:07:31,924 --> 01:07:33,467
That's the girl's egg.

847
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,093
That's Gordo's egg.

848
01:07:35,177 --> 01:07:36,595
That's the girl's egg.

849
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:38,055
Then where the fuck was my egg?

850
01:07:44,186 --> 01:07:45,229
You want to say grace?

851
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:47,272
This meal's for you.

852
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,233
Roger.

853
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:51,652
- Ready?
- Let's do it.

854
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:52,736
Our father,

855
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:55,113
thank you for preserving
our lives another day on Earth

856
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:56,531
so we may execute your will.

857
01:07:57,616 --> 01:07:58,575
We love you, dear Lord.

858
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:00,327
Thank you for this meal
and this wonderful company. Amen.

859
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:02,162
Amen.

860
01:08:08,627 --> 01:08:09,795
Emma.

861
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,842
Offer the girl her plate.

862
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:20,681
There you go. Oops!

863
01:08:21,515 --> 01:08:22,724
Hold on.

864
01:08:30,065 --> 01:08:32,401
Hang on, there.
I'm gonna fix that for you.

865
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:35,779
Let me just fix this for you real quick.

866
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,200
I didn't touch her.

867
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:47,499
Switch with me.

868
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:05,225
Y'all were gonna eat like
kings and queens over here.

869
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,395
And we weren't invited.

870
01:09:08,854 --> 01:09:11,648
I wonder why we weren't invited.

871
01:09:11,732 --> 01:09:13,859
Guess they too good for us.

872
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:21,992
I'm enjoying my meal, boys.

873
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,452
- Are you?
- Enjoying your meal?

874
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:27,998
And as much as you want to destroy it,
you're not gonna fucking stop me.

875
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:30,167
- And neither will you.
- No, sir.

876
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,044
And neither will you.

877
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:41,053
Hey, Norman.

878
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:44,097
Do you like horses?

879
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:49,936
Don likes horses.

880
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:53,148
Ain't that right, Don?

881
01:09:58,445 --> 01:09:59,905
We're eating.

882
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:02,824
No, we're not. I'm done.

883
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:04,701
I'm fucking done eating.

884
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:16,880
Hey, in France,

885
01:10:18,465 --> 01:10:20,967
we hit the beach right after D-Day.

886
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:23,512
Right?

887
01:10:24,346 --> 01:10:27,891
And we had to fight through
all these fucking hedgerows.

888
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:31,144
Fucking pain in the ass, right?

889
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:34,314
We finally hit open country,
and we linked up

890
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:37,150
with the British and the Canadians
and you know what we did?

891
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:39,403
You know what we did.

892
01:10:40,028 --> 01:10:44,241
We trapped an entire Kraut army
pulling back into Germany.

893
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:49,830
We fucked them up.

894
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:52,999
- Yeah.
- Yes, we did.

895
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:59,256
There was dead Krauts and horses,
busted up tanks and cars for miles.

896
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,008
Miles.

897
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:05,929
Your eyes see it,

898
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,975
but your head can't make no sense of it.

899
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:13,186
And we go in there...

900
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:19,734
And for three whole days,

901
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,737
we shoot the wounded horses.

902
01:11:22,821 --> 01:11:24,156
All day long.

903
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,992
Sunup to sundown, just shooting horses.

904
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:30,203
And they were some hot summer days.

905
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:34,458
I ain't never smelled nothing like that, top.

906
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:37,627
Do you know how you kill a horse?

907
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:39,254
You pet it on the...

908
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:41,381
Pet it on the forehead, no?

909
01:11:41,465 --> 01:11:44,050
And it becomes your friend,
it goes like this.

910
01:11:44,134 --> 01:11:47,179
And then you shoot it
right through the spine.

911
01:11:48,263 --> 01:11:50,056
And the sound of it?

912
01:11:50,891 --> 01:11:53,310
Those fucking screaming horses?

913
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:55,395
Do you remember that, Don?

914
01:11:57,772 --> 01:12:00,984
All the black clouds of flies
just buzzing around.

915
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,738
It was like being in a giant beehive.

916
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:07,657
But you weren't there.

917
01:12:18,168 --> 01:12:19,920
That was a real fine story.

918
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:22,214
Pleasant mealtime talk. Thank you.

919
01:12:22,589 --> 01:12:24,674
Thank you. Thank you.

920
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:27,219
It is what happened, Don.

921
01:12:28,637 --> 01:12:32,390
What happened, happened.
What's gonna happen is gonna happen.

922
01:12:32,474 --> 01:12:34,601
Sitting here playing house
with a couple bitch Krauts

923
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:35,685
ain't gonna change a fucking thing.

924
01:12:35,769 --> 01:12:37,270
Shut the fuck up.

925
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:39,105
Why should I shut up?

926
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:40,398
You shouldn't.

927
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,252
I'm just drunk. I'm sorry.

928
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:16,142
Where's Love 1 -6?

929
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:17,769
Right here.

930
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,104
The Old Man wants you.

931
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:20,939
- How come?
- You got a mission.

932
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:24,317
Let's go.

933
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:29,322
Where are you going?

934
01:13:30,615 --> 01:13:32,033
To take the next town

935
01:13:32,993 --> 01:13:34,828
and the next and the next

936
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:37,664
until you people quit.

937
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:39,499
Do you have a pen? I'll write you.

938
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,043
Y'all getting married?
Is that what the fuck y'all doing?

939
01:13:42,127 --> 01:13:43,461
This a fucking wedding?

940
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:46,548
Hurry up. There are more of them.

941
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:49,134
What am I walking into?

942
01:13:50,302 --> 01:13:54,264
A recon plane spotted
a troop concentration moving west, here.

943
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:57,726
Battalion needs you
to guard these crossroads here

944
01:13:58,476 --> 01:14:00,228
in this grid on the overlay.

945
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:03,148
How many troops did he see?

946
01:14:03,231 --> 01:14:04,399
I don't know.

947
01:14:05,025 --> 01:14:06,860
What kind of troops?

948
01:14:08,028 --> 01:14:10,238
They have tanks, horses, artillery?

949
01:14:11,323 --> 01:14:14,659
I wish I could help you.
He took fire, he got the fuck out of there.

950
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:16,870
Enough to spook the Colonel.

951
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:19,748
All the tanks are driving on Berlin.

952
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:22,500
There's a couple of thousand cooks,
mechanics and doctors here.

953
01:14:22,584 --> 01:14:24,961
Those Krauts hit them, it'll be a slaughter.

954
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,381
All we got is you.

955
01:14:30,425 --> 01:14:32,510
We need you to the crossroads
fast as you can.

956
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:35,430
Secure them. Don't stop for anything.
You understand?

957
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:37,265
Take my gas if you have to.

958
01:14:37,349 --> 01:14:38,725
If those troops get past you,

959
01:14:40,268 --> 01:14:42,020
they're gonna smash
into the supply train.

960
01:14:43,188 --> 01:14:44,898
Then the whole division's fucked.

961
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:48,234
All right, sir. We're on the way.

962
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:51,613
- Is that gas?
- Open it up.

963
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:54,282
- Yeah, it's good.
- Okay.

964
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:56,660
- Incoming!
- Grady, jump, jump, jump!

965
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,180
Grady, you up?

966
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:29,776
You good?

967
01:15:30,235 --> 01:15:31,736
Boys, good?

968
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:33,029
Thank the Krauts for that.

969
01:15:33,113 --> 01:15:34,155
Binkowski?

970
01:15:34,322 --> 01:15:35,365
- Davis, good?
- Grady!

971
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:36,616
Everybody up!

972
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:38,702
You up?

973
01:15:40,495 --> 01:15:41,788
I'm up.

974
01:15:49,796 --> 01:15:52,966
All right, let's get an aid station right there.

975
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,510
- Check Peterson. We're gonna mount up.
- Norman!

976
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,095
- Emma!
- I got him.

977
01:15:58,555 --> 01:15:59,931
Emma!

978
01:16:03,643 --> 01:16:05,895
- Fuck.
- Who do you think you are, huh?

979
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:07,021
Jesus Christ?

980
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:09,733
Fuck!

981
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:12,736
You gonna raise her up, Norman?
Get your ass back on the fucking tank.

982
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:14,779
- Fuck is wrong with you?
- What the fuck are you doing?

983
01:16:14,863 --> 01:16:16,531
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What you gonna do?

984
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:17,574
You gonna get mad?

985
01:16:17,657 --> 01:16:19,659
Feel anything? Piece of shit!

986
01:16:19,743 --> 01:16:21,411
- That's it, come on! Come on.
- Fuck you!

987
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:23,163
- You feel it?
- Fuck you!

988
01:16:23,747 --> 01:16:24,873
It's called war!

989
01:16:25,165 --> 01:16:26,249
You feel it?

990
01:16:29,836 --> 01:16:32,672
Get your fucking spindly ass
back on that fucking tank!

991
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:35,467
Where the fuck you think you are?

992
01:16:40,138 --> 01:16:41,848
Oh, God, why?

993
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,852
Tankers, mount up!

994
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:38,029
You see that?

995
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:45,578
That's an entire city on fire.

996
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:57,090
I started this war killing Germans in Africa,
then France, then Belgium.

997
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,758
Now I'm killing Germans in Germany.

998
01:18:01,219 --> 01:18:02,637
It will end.

999
01:18:03,555 --> 01:18:04,681
Soon.

1000
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:09,602
But before it does,
a lot more people got to die.

1001
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:51,644
Fuck! Reverse hard left! Hard left!

1002
01:18:51,728 --> 01:18:52,729
Reverse!

1003
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:56,482
- Fuck!
- Back up, back up, back up! Hard left!

1004
01:18:57,901 --> 01:18:59,861
<i>Hatches! Hatches! Back up!</i>

1005
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:01,821
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!</i>

1006
01:19:01,905 --> 01:19:03,656
<i>Back up. Left stick.</i>

1007
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:05,992
<i>Go, go, go! Hard stick!</i>

1008
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,494
What the fuck was it?

1009
01:19:08,828 --> 01:19:09,829
<i>That was an 88.</i>

1010
01:19:09,913 --> 01:19:11,664
It's a goddamn tank.

1011
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,166
Where the fuck is it?

1012
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:18,296
Tank! 12 o'clock, 800 yards.

1013
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:19,589
I see it! It's a goddamn Tiger!

1014
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:20,840
<i>Put some fucking smoke in his face!</i>

1015
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:22,342
Let's go, Grady. Smoke up, Grady.

1016
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:24,385
- Smoke's up! Clear!
- On the way!

1017
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:29,474
We have to get to the crossroads.
We got to get past them.

1018
01:19:29,557 --> 01:19:31,351
Don, let's get the fuck out of here! Let's go!

1019
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:32,810
Unless he drowns himself
in a shit-filled ditch,

1020
01:19:32,894 --> 01:19:34,103
he's our problem.

1021
01:19:34,187 --> 01:19:35,438
Hit that son of a bitch!

1022
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:37,190
- Almost up!
<i>- Light the bastard!</i>

1023
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:38,650
- Clear!
- On the way!

1024
01:19:40,068 --> 01:19:41,361
Shoot that fucker!

1025
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:43,196
<i>Fire when ready!</i>

1026
01:19:44,364 --> 01:19:46,240
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1027
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:54,832
Driver make ready.

1028
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:57,043
Load Anti-Tank.

1029
01:19:58,044 --> 01:19:59,462
All right, all tanks, move forward!

1030
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:00,588
Fuck!

1031
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:03,341
<i>- Peterson, right flank!</i>
- Right stick.

1032
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:05,385
Davis, left with me, stay abreast.

1033
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:06,970
Let's go right at them, let's go right at them!

1034
01:20:07,053 --> 01:20:08,054
<i>Gordo, left flank.</i>

1035
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:09,889
Let's bum-rush this cocksucker!

1036
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:12,225
<i>Right stick. Taking the right flank.</i>

1037
01:20:15,687 --> 01:20:16,729
New target.

1038
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,189
Tank on the left.

1039
01:20:19,649 --> 01:20:21,401
10 o'clock... 700 metres.

1040
01:20:23,611 --> 01:20:25,071
He's coming out.

1041
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:26,197
Fire!

1042
01:20:26,906 --> 01:20:28,866
<i>- Loader, A.P, A.P.</i>
- Clear!

1043
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:30,535
- Hit 'em!
- On the way!

1044
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:32,495
<i>Commence!</i>

1045
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:34,747
- All right, pump him! Pump him!
<i>- Gyros on!</i>

1046
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:39,544
- What do you want, top?
<i>- Loader, A.P., A.P., smash him.</i>

1047
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:41,087
You're clear, Boyd!

1048
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:44,090
A.P., 500 yards.

1049
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:45,383
Fire!

1050
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:47,593
Elevate... 600 metres.

1051
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:49,762
- Again!
- Fuck, Grady, put it in, now.

1052
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:51,055
- Clear!
- On the way!

1053
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:57,645
God!

1054
01:20:58,146 --> 01:20:59,355
God damn it!

1055
01:20:59,731 --> 01:21:00,940
- Fuck!
<i>- Hit 'em!</i>

1056
01:21:01,733 --> 01:21:03,568
- Clear!
- On the way!

1057
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:05,862
Same target.

1058
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:07,071
Fire!

1059
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:11,826
They got Peterson!

1060
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:13,036
<i>God damn!</i>

1061
01:21:22,462 --> 01:21:24,338
- It's a fucking beast.
- Fuck!

1062
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:25,923
Gordo, flank left! Left!

1063
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:27,800
Davis, cross him.

1064
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:29,886
Flank right! Flank right!

1065
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:31,721
Copy! Right stick! Right stick!

1066
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,140
<i>Traverse left.</i>

1067
01:21:34,474 --> 01:21:35,850
Davis, he's lining up!

1068
01:21:36,184 --> 01:21:37,310
Fire!

1069
01:21:39,062 --> 01:21:40,480
Target 11 o'clock.

1070
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,649
Shoot the son of a bitch!
He's lining up on Roy!

1071
01:21:45,026 --> 01:21:46,402
<i>God damn it, I said fire!</i>

1072
01:21:46,486 --> 01:21:47,653
Fire!

1073
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:56,120
- God damn it.
- Fuck!

1074
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:58,331
<i>Roy's gone.</i>

1075
01:21:58,414 --> 01:21:59,665
We're all that's left.

1076
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:01,667
<i>It's up to us now.</i>

1077
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:03,377
Driver halt!

1078
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:06,172
Gordo, get around him.
Put us on his backside.

1079
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:08,841
<i>If we get behind him, we can kill him.
Go! Go! Go!</i>

1080
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:11,886
Reverse reverse!

1081
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:14,222
Don't let him behind us!

1082
01:22:14,347 --> 01:22:15,681
Faster, Gordo!

1083
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:19,644
God damn it!

1084
01:22:21,729 --> 01:22:23,022
Forward.

1085
01:22:25,358 --> 01:22:26,442
Target 2 o'clock!

1086
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:31,489
- God damn it! Fuck!
- What was that?

1087
01:22:31,572 --> 01:22:32,824
- We got hit!
- I lost it.

1088
01:22:32,907 --> 01:22:33,950
Boyd, are you all right?

1089
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:34,992
- Shit!
- Fuck!

1090
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:36,536
We lost power traverse. Switching to manual.

1091
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:37,870
Boyd, you stay in the fight!

1092
01:22:37,954 --> 01:22:39,497
- Bible, hit him!
<i>- On the way!</i>

1093
01:22:40,957 --> 01:22:42,375
Coming around! He's coming around!

1094
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:43,793
<i>Gordo, you got to outrun that gun!</i>

1095
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:46,212
- Oh, I got it! I got it!
- Fire!

1096
01:22:47,088 --> 01:22:49,507
<i>Gordo, put it in third. Right stick!</i>

1097
01:22:51,509 --> 01:22:53,719
Bible, put it up his ass,
where the armor's thin.

1098
01:22:53,803 --> 01:22:54,929
I know where to fucking hit him!

1099
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:57,223
- Boyd, you're clear!
- On the way!

1100
01:22:58,391 --> 01:23:01,060
- Shit!
<i>- God damn it, I said in the ass!</i>

1101
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:02,812
We're moving too fast!
It's not that fucking easy!

1102
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:04,230
Come on, Boyd, stay on him!

1103
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,482
Gordo, when I say back up, you back up.
Left stick.

1104
01:23:06,566 --> 01:23:07,567
All right, all right.

1105
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:09,652
Bible, stand by. I'll call the shot.

1106
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:10,903
Roger! Roger!

1107
01:23:12,697 --> 01:23:14,198
Gordo, now! Reverse! Reverse!

1108
01:23:14,282 --> 01:23:15,700
<i>Left stick!</i>

1109
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:19,370
Bible, steady.

1110
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:22,081
<i>Steady.</i>

1111
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:23,624
Shoot the bastard!

1112
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:26,002
- Come on, Bible!
- Come on, fucking shoot him!

1113
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:27,253
Steady.

1114
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:32,049
- Now!
- On the way!

1115
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:38,222
Fuck! Grady, one more! One more, Grady!

1116
01:23:38,306 --> 01:23:39,682
- Grady, Grady, Grady!
- Clear!

1117
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:41,475
- Again!
- On the way!

1118
01:23:47,273 --> 01:23:48,524
Clear!

1119
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,026
- Tank destroyed.
<i>- Gordo, halt.</i>

1120
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:52,486
Jesus Christ.

1121
01:23:59,493 --> 01:24:01,245
Fucking Nazi fuck!

1122
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:05,625
Fuck you!

1123
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,155
Radio check, Love 1 -6.

1124
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:38,407
Yeah, boy.

1125
01:24:39,867 --> 01:24:41,452
Radio check, Love 1 -6.

1126
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:43,120
Fucking handed him.

1127
01:24:45,331 --> 01:24:47,833
- Good fucking job, Gordo.
- Radio check, Love 1 -6.

1128
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:51,837
Radio check, Love 1 -6.

1129
01:24:56,092 --> 01:24:58,886
Radio's eighty-sixed. We're on our own.

1130
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:10,106
Good shot.

1131
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:14,694
It wasn't me.
No, no, I'm the instrument, not the hand.

1132
01:25:16,696 --> 01:25:18,739
God didn't call us today.

1133
01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:20,491
You hear me, boys?

1134
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:22,451
What's he doing up there?

1135
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:25,204
Big pair of dice?

1136
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:29,583
Everyone else came up snake eyes but us?

1137
01:25:29,959 --> 01:25:31,877
- Lord's protection.
- We got it, don't we, Boyd?

1138
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:33,754
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- We got it.

1139
01:25:35,256 --> 01:25:38,009
Norman mowed them fuckers down,
didn't he, too?

1140
01:25:38,092 --> 01:25:40,636
- Good job, Norman.
- Welcome to the Army, Norm.

1141
01:25:40,761 --> 01:25:42,221
You did good.

1142
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:48,894
- Best job I ever had.
- Best job I ever had.

1143
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:51,105
Best job I ever had.

1144
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,652
Best job I ever had.

1145
01:25:57,445 --> 01:25:58,612
Shit.

1146
01:26:01,115 --> 01:26:02,742
We're still open for business.

1147
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:05,286
Let's head out for those crossroads,

1148
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:07,705
keep it out of Krauts' hands
like we've been told.

1149
01:26:08,039 --> 01:26:11,500
There's a wave coming in.
We're the rock to break that wave.

1150
01:26:16,714 --> 01:26:17,965
Gordo, get us out of here.

1151
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:20,718
Fuck it.

1152
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:42,239
All right, there's the crossroads.

1153
01:26:42,323 --> 01:26:45,159
Gordo, take us up on that hill.
We can cover the whole valley from there.

1154
01:26:54,377 --> 01:26:56,128
Grady, get down!

1155
01:27:02,385 --> 01:27:04,220
Shit! Not another fucking Tiger!

1156
01:27:04,303 --> 01:27:05,262
- A mine.
- Where's it coming from?

1157
01:27:05,346 --> 01:27:08,432
- Where?
- Settle down. It's a mine. We hit a mine, is all.

1158
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,811
- Everybody off. Grady?
- Yeah, I'm off.

1159
01:27:11,894 --> 01:27:13,312
Shit.

1160
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,107
How bad is it?

1161
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:19,151
It's broke as fuck. Busted a bogie, too.

1162
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:20,986
Can you fix it?

1163
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:23,197
Yeah, why not?

1164
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:33,707
All right, Norman,
you and Coon-Ass check out that building.

1165
01:27:33,791 --> 01:27:36,085
- Get my Thompson.
- What?

1166
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:37,294
Go get the Thompson.

1167
01:27:37,378 --> 01:27:39,088
- Gordo!
- Yeah?

1168
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:41,382
- You got that rope bag?
- Right here.

1169
01:28:09,577 --> 01:28:13,247
You can put the gun down, Norman.
Ain't gonna do nothing.

1170
01:28:22,298 --> 01:28:23,841
Can we go now?

1171
01:28:26,844 --> 01:28:28,888
Norman, I'm sorry. You know?

1172
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:32,600
I think...

1173
01:28:33,893 --> 01:28:35,895
I think you're a good man.

1174
01:28:36,896 --> 01:28:38,564
It's what I think.

1175
01:28:41,442 --> 01:28:44,862
I think maybe we ain't, but I think you are.

1176
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:48,199
See, I just... I wanted to tell you that.

1177
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:52,203
It's okay.

1178
01:28:55,998 --> 01:28:57,708
Come on, let's go.

1179
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:02,421
- Anything?
- No, nothing.

1180
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:05,466
It's an aid station. They all dead.

1181
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:10,846
Kid.

1182
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:16,977
Head up top of that hill, near those trees.
You got outpost guard.

1183
01:29:17,937 --> 01:29:19,772
Can I grab my canteen?

1184
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:22,650
Yeah, you can grab your canteen.

1185
01:29:37,373 --> 01:29:38,415
Norman!

1186
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:41,794
Top of the hill,
then work your way from the trees.

1187
01:32:12,653 --> 01:32:15,155
Hey! Hey!

1188
01:32:17,783 --> 01:32:19,368
Good evening, Norman.
Why aren't you at your post?

1189
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:20,411
Slow down.

1190
01:32:20,494 --> 01:32:22,538
- They're coming right now.
- Who's coming?

1191
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:24,957
- The Germans!
- How many?

1192
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:27,584
- Too many. Too many to count.
- How many?

1193
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:31,547
About two, maybe 300 of them.

1194
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,173
They got vehicles, too.

1195
01:32:33,257 --> 01:32:35,134
- Tanks?
- No, no, no, just trucks.

1196
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:37,219
Probably a bunch of bums
looking to surrender, that's all.

1197
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:39,388
No. No, no, no.
They were marching, they were singing.

1198
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:40,639
They sounded like they wanted a fight.

1199
01:32:40,723 --> 01:32:42,015
- What do you mean, they were singing?
- Where?

1200
01:32:42,099 --> 01:32:44,309
I'm telling you. Right over there.

1201
01:32:47,354 --> 01:32:49,231
Hey, you hear that?

1202
01:32:49,314 --> 01:32:52,025
- It's a goddamn SS battalion.
- Bullshit.

1203
01:32:52,109 --> 01:32:53,736
Jesus Christ.

1204
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:57,114
- Grady, get my gun.
- Yeah.

1205
01:32:57,197 --> 01:32:58,782
- You want to get your weapon?
- Shit.

1206
01:32:58,866 --> 01:33:00,701
- What do you want to do?
- Let's just get our shit, all right?

1207
01:33:00,784 --> 01:33:03,954
Look, it's about to be dark.
We just get on up out of here, huh?

1208
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:05,789
- Let 'em pass on through.
- Let's him them woods.

1209
01:33:05,873 --> 01:33:08,876
Norman, go get your shit. Go get your pack.

1210
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:11,295
Let's go.

1211
01:33:12,504 --> 01:33:14,423
We never run before, I ain't running now.

1212
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:16,550
- What was that?
- We're gonna fight it out.

1213
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:19,011
- We can't.
- I'm gonna hold this crossroad.

1214
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:21,930
What you mean, you're gonna hold...
The tank's busted!

1215
01:33:22,014 --> 01:33:23,932
- The tank's fucking busted, top!
- Hey.

1216
01:33:24,016 --> 01:33:25,517
- Yeah, you said that.
- Top, what are you doing?

1217
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:26,852
What do you want to do?
You want to sit here?

1218
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:28,103
- I'm gonna hold this crossroad.
- You want to sit here

1219
01:33:28,187 --> 01:33:29,188
and hold off a SS battalion...

1220
01:33:29,271 --> 01:33:30,773
No, it's not what I want to do,
but it's what we're doing.

1221
01:33:30,856 --> 01:33:32,816
- There's five of us...
- Get to your fighting positions! Mount up!

1222
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:34,985
What you mean fucking fighting positions
when we ain't got a tank?

1223
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:36,069
How we gonna fight?

1224
01:33:36,153 --> 01:33:38,280
- We got a cannon!
- Don, that don't make sense!

1225
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:40,866
Stop! What are you doing?

1226
01:33:55,464 --> 01:33:57,508
Get out of here. Get to that tree line.

1227
01:34:05,182 --> 01:34:08,519
Boys, take care of yourselves.
Get to that tree line.

1228
01:34:17,361 --> 01:34:18,821
It's all right.

1229
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:24,034
It's all right.

1230
01:34:27,079 --> 01:34:28,539
It's my home.

1231
01:34:45,681 --> 01:34:47,724
I'm staying here with you.

1232
01:34:52,396 --> 01:34:53,438
All right.

1233
01:34:53,939 --> 01:34:55,899
I'll need you to load.

1234
01:34:58,527 --> 01:35:00,904
Boys, get on. It's all right.

1235
01:35:03,282 --> 01:35:04,867
Grady, come on.

1236
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:10,914
We're gonna stay.

1237
01:35:17,004 --> 01:35:18,672
What is your plan?

1238
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:33,478
Fuck it.

1239
01:35:37,649 --> 01:35:39,234
Get us one of them dead Krauts.

1240
01:36:09,014 --> 01:36:10,223
Light him up.

1241
01:36:32,412 --> 01:36:34,247
You wanna take that kit right there. That's it.

1242
01:36:34,331 --> 01:36:38,001
- Go and grab it. That's it.
- All right, all right.

1243
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:39,711
Grease gun.

1244
01:36:39,795 --> 01:36:41,630
- Go on, hand it to him.
- Another box.

1245
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:44,758
Go ahead and get it ready.
Listen, you do not waste one shot.

1246
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:46,134
- You hear me?
- Gordo.

1247
01:36:46,218 --> 01:36:47,552
- Grenades.
- Ammo count.

1248
01:36:47,636 --> 01:36:49,721
- Put that there.
- Make them count.

1249
01:36:49,805 --> 01:36:52,265
What kind of rounds you got up there?
Norm?

1250
01:36:52,349 --> 01:36:53,600
- I only got two.
- All right.

1251
01:36:53,684 --> 01:36:55,227
Ready?

1252
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:56,770
That's it. Yeah.

1253
01:36:58,689 --> 01:37:00,649
I'm going through ammo like water.

1254
01:37:01,066 --> 01:37:05,487
That's four rounds of smoke,
and 23 super charge and 33 solid shot.

1255
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,322
- What you want, top?
- Load super charge.

1256
01:37:07,406 --> 01:37:08,490
Set the point delay.

1257
01:37:09,282 --> 01:37:10,575
Norman, get it ready.

1258
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:17,624
That's it. Here we go, Boyd.

1259
01:37:21,545 --> 01:37:23,088
Gordo, grab me that one.

1260
01:37:29,052 --> 01:37:30,595
- Boyd.
- Thank you.

1261
01:37:30,929 --> 01:37:32,681
Give me that can.

1262
01:37:48,989 --> 01:37:53,118
Might as well get a little tight.
Won't be around for the hangover.

1263
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:15,432
God, that's better than good.

1264
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:22,689
Give it here.

1265
01:38:28,195 --> 01:38:29,654
Give it here.

1266
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:37,788
- What you gonna do with that?
- I'm gonna drink it.

1267
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:42,334
I know you hate me preaching. I know it.

1268
01:38:42,417 --> 01:38:44,711
But what we're doing here
is a righteous act, gentlemen.

1269
01:38:45,295 --> 01:38:46,880
You hear me, Gordo?

1270
01:38:52,177 --> 01:38:55,222
You know, there's a Bible verse
I think about sometimes.

1271
01:38:57,057 --> 01:38:58,433
Many times.

1272
01:38:59,351 --> 01:39:00,811
It goes...

1273
01:39:02,354 --> 01:39:05,732
"Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying,"

1274
01:39:05,816 --> 01:39:09,027
"Whom shall I send?
And who will go for us?"

1275
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:21,623
"And I said,."

1276
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:24,501
"Here am I."

1277
01:39:26,461 --> 01:39:28,046
"Send me."

1278
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:36,388
"Send me."

1279
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:40,809
Book of Isaiah, Chapter Six.

1280
01:39:49,693 --> 01:39:52,028
Yeah. Yeah, Don.

1281
01:39:53,947 --> 01:39:56,408
That's exactly right. Oh, wow.

1282
01:39:57,784 --> 01:39:58,785
You're something.

1283
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,390
God damn, son.

1284
01:40:21,057 --> 01:40:24,019
You a fighting, fucking,
drinking machine, ain't you?

1285
01:40:24,686 --> 01:40:26,771
Machine, that's it, that's his war name.

1286
01:40:27,272 --> 01:40:28,481
That's perfect.

1287
01:40:29,274 --> 01:40:30,817
I christen thee "Machine."

1288
01:40:32,444 --> 01:40:33,904
- Machine!
- Machine!

1289
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:35,155
Machine!

1290
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:36,615
- Machine!
- Yeah.

1291
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,035
Machine.

1292
01:40:43,705 --> 01:40:45,081
I love it in here.

1293
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:47,167
I do.

1294
01:40:48,627 --> 01:40:51,588
- Best job I ever had.
- Best fucking job.

1295
01:40:55,133 --> 01:40:56,593
Yeah.

1296
01:41:05,977 --> 01:41:07,479
They're coming.

1297
01:41:13,735 --> 01:41:16,154
No one makes a move unless I say.

1298
01:41:16,863 --> 01:41:18,406
Come on, you cocksuckers, come on in.

1299
01:41:44,683 --> 01:41:45,725
Come on in.

1300
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:53,775
Almost.

1301
01:42:00,991 --> 01:42:02,867
Come on in. Hey, come on.

1302
01:42:18,633 --> 01:42:19,676
Now!

1303
01:42:23,221 --> 01:42:25,390
Like that, motherfuckers?

1304
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:26,850
- Clear!
- Fire!

1305
01:42:26,933 --> 01:42:28,018
On the way!

1306
01:42:30,437 --> 01:42:32,063
- Clear!
- On the way!

1307
01:42:47,704 --> 01:42:49,622
Fucking Nazi. Fuck!

1308
01:42:53,251 --> 01:42:54,711
They're running! They're running!
Traverse left!

1309
01:42:54,794 --> 01:42:57,005
Bow gunner, squirt those
assholes running for that mill.

1310
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:58,465
Cut those fuckers down!

1311
01:43:01,051 --> 01:43:02,677
Loader, four rounds of Willy Pete.

1312
01:43:02,761 --> 01:43:04,596
Bible, put it in that building.
It's full of fucking Krauts.

1313
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:05,930
- Clear!
- Fire! Fire!

1314
01:43:06,056 --> 01:43:07,223
On the way!

1315
01:43:10,602 --> 01:43:12,020
Give me another. That was beautiful.

1316
01:43:12,854 --> 01:43:14,773
- You clear!
- On the way!

1317
01:43:16,441 --> 01:43:17,525
Bow gunner, watch that left!

1318
01:43:17,609 --> 01:43:19,110
Yeah, you better fucking run.

1319
01:43:28,453 --> 01:43:29,621
Traverse right!

1320
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:34,501
On the way!

1321
01:43:37,295 --> 01:43:39,297
Bible, stay on 'em. 15 up, 15 up. Fire!

1322
01:43:39,381 --> 01:43:40,715
- Clear!
- On the way!

1323
01:43:45,136 --> 01:43:46,888
Traverse right! Doughs, two o'clock!

1324
01:43:46,971 --> 01:43:48,473
Give 'em a big kick in the butt!

1325
01:43:49,599 --> 01:43:50,642
All right, I'm on them.

1326
01:43:50,767 --> 01:43:52,310
- You're clear!
- On the way!

1327
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:54,813
Loader, give me another point delay.
Skip it on the ground.

1328
01:43:54,896 --> 01:43:55,939
Bounce those fuckers!

1329
01:43:58,108 --> 01:43:59,692
- Clear!
- On the way!

1330
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:02,946
Come on!

1331
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:07,242
Hit 'em again!

1332
01:44:07,784 --> 01:44:08,993
Go, boys! Go, boys!

1333
01:44:09,077 --> 01:44:11,287
Grady, Grady, Grady,
Grady, Grady, come on, now.

1334
01:44:11,663 --> 01:44:12,914
- Clear!
- Light 'em up!

1335
01:44:12,997 --> 01:44:14,082
On the way!

1336
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:16,876
Down 15. Steady.

1337
01:44:17,544 --> 01:44:18,545
Traverse left!

1338
01:44:20,213 --> 01:44:21,673
- You clear!
- Fire at will!

1339
01:44:21,756 --> 01:44:22,757
On the way!

1340
01:44:24,551 --> 01:44:26,094
That's right, burn to the fucking ground.

1341
01:44:30,557 --> 01:44:31,683
Machine, clock one!

1342
01:44:38,064 --> 01:44:39,149
I'm out!

1343
01:44:39,232 --> 01:44:40,358
I need a new can!

1344
01:44:40,483 --> 01:44:41,526
Shoot, we out! We out!

1345
01:44:41,609 --> 01:44:44,487
Fuck. We got a case rupture.
This gun is gone.

1346
01:44:44,904 --> 01:44:47,240
- We need more boxes of ammo!
- We got .30 on the roof.

1347
01:44:47,323 --> 01:44:48,700
All right, we got ammo outside.

1348
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,326
I'm gonna lay down some smokes.

1349
01:44:51,202 --> 01:44:53,788
Gordo, on my signal, pop your hatch,
lay down some cover fire.

1350
01:44:53,872 --> 01:44:55,123
- Okay, roger.
- Machine, you do the same.

1351
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:56,458
- Grab that grease gun.
- Copy.

1352
01:44:56,541 --> 01:44:58,918
Cover right!
Bible, get ready to snatch that .30.

1353
01:44:59,002 --> 01:45:00,086
Roger.

1354
01:45:20,482 --> 01:45:21,900
All right, here we go.

1355
01:45:26,446 --> 01:45:27,489
Go!

1356
01:45:37,499 --> 01:45:38,500
They're outside the tank!

1357
01:45:38,583 --> 01:45:39,584
Pick them off!

1358
01:45:44,464 --> 01:45:45,590
Come on, Boyd!

1359
01:45:47,217 --> 01:45:48,426
Take it, Grady.

1360
01:46:06,194 --> 01:46:07,195
Move up!

1361
01:46:07,362 --> 01:46:08,488
Button up!

1362
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:29,759
Quick, quick, quick!

1363
01:46:29,842 --> 01:46:31,469
- Quick, quick, quick!
- Hurry up, Grady!

1364
01:46:40,812 --> 01:46:43,648
- Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck!
- Shoot him, Bible!

1365
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:02,834
- Gord? Gordo?
- Grady, I need two more.

1366
01:47:03,126 --> 01:47:06,045
- I got two left.
- They're getting cocky.

1367
01:47:06,129 --> 01:47:08,339
Fuckers. He's hit.

1368
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:11,551
Damn sure ain't no good
leaking oil everywhere.

1369
01:47:11,676 --> 01:47:13,177
So patch me up, then.

1370
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,430
Hey, take these two boxes.
Put 'em down below.

1371
01:47:16,055 --> 01:47:17,557
Hey, Grady, come on. Keep it coming.

1372
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:19,517
All right. Open the other one for me.

1373
01:47:22,895 --> 01:47:26,774
If a man loves the world,
the love of the father's not in him.

1374
01:47:29,027 --> 01:47:30,903
For all that's in the world,

1375
01:47:31,237 --> 01:47:35,366
lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes,
pride of life

1376
01:47:36,534 --> 01:47:39,287
it's not of the father. It's of the world.

1377
01:47:40,163 --> 01:47:42,040
The world and its desires pass away.

1378
01:47:43,207 --> 01:47:44,959
But he who does God's will
is gonna live forever.

1379
01:47:45,168 --> 01:47:46,419
Forever.

1380
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:00,516
Lift it up.

1381
01:48:05,938 --> 01:48:07,732
Swarm and kill them!

1382
01:48:08,566 --> 01:48:09,567
Make them count!

1383
01:48:10,068 --> 01:48:11,903
They're all we have.

1384
01:48:33,883 --> 01:48:36,552
Save your ammo.
Don't shoot unless you see something.

1385
01:48:37,261 --> 01:48:38,846
We can be damn sure they're
working their way behind us.

1386
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:40,640
- Anybody see anything?
- I see nothing.

1387
01:48:40,723 --> 01:48:41,849
- I got nothing.
- Nothing.

1388
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:44,477
Advance, advance quickly.

1389
01:48:49,691 --> 01:48:50,858
Panzerfaust, four o'clock!

1390
01:48:52,443 --> 01:48:53,486
Traverse right!

1391
01:48:55,488 --> 01:48:57,365
- He missed!
- Hit him with the coax!

1392
01:49:05,957 --> 01:49:07,041
Fuck!

1393
01:49:16,426 --> 01:49:17,969
Grady. Hey.

1394
01:49:19,637 --> 01:49:21,472
Fuck! Fuck!

1395
01:49:22,306 --> 01:49:25,101
No. No. No.

1396
01:49:27,478 --> 01:49:29,105
No. No.

1397
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:31,941
God.

1398
01:49:33,317 --> 01:49:35,445
- Hey, Grady...
- Get up!

1399
01:49:35,570 --> 01:49:36,696
We're still in this fight!

1400
01:49:38,948 --> 01:49:40,158
We're still in this fight!

1401
01:49:43,661 --> 01:49:45,663
Watch our right, watch our right.

1402
01:49:49,417 --> 01:49:51,002
Stay on the .30. Keep hammering them.

1403
01:50:05,725 --> 01:50:07,977
Yeah, you motherfuckers! Come on.

1404
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:16,152
How long can we keep this up?

1405
01:50:17,653 --> 01:50:20,031
- Come on, keep shooting!
- Fuck, I'm out! I'm out!

1406
01:50:20,907 --> 01:50:21,991
I need a new can!

1407
01:50:22,241 --> 01:50:23,367
That was our last belt.

1408
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:24,535
She's out!

1409
01:50:26,412 --> 01:50:27,622
That's all there is.

1410
01:50:28,539 --> 01:50:29,624
Fuck!

1411
01:50:29,707 --> 01:50:31,959
- Fuck.
- Don't get your panties in a bunch.

1412
01:50:32,043 --> 01:50:34,003
We still got hand weapons and the .50.

1413
01:50:38,257 --> 01:50:39,383
Who's with me?

1414
01:50:41,886 --> 01:50:44,222
They're running low on ammunition!

1415
01:50:45,056 --> 01:50:47,266
Finish them!

1416
01:50:48,226 --> 01:50:49,685
This is our land!

1417
01:50:50,061 --> 01:50:51,229
Attention!

1418
01:50:51,437 --> 01:50:52,522
Move out!

1419
01:51:03,324 --> 01:51:04,575
Gordo?

1420
01:51:06,786 --> 01:51:08,079
Machine!

1421
01:51:44,782 --> 01:51:46,158
Where the hell are they?

1422
01:51:48,369 --> 01:51:49,954
They're everywhere.

1423
01:52:16,022 --> 01:52:18,357
Fuck! Fuck, I'm out!

1424
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:20,985
Gun's gone! I need a weapon!

1425
01:52:21,819 --> 01:52:22,904
Bible, no!

1426
01:52:56,687 --> 01:52:58,022
Grenade!

1427
01:53:22,922 --> 01:53:24,340
Go! Come on!

1428
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:33,891
What the fuck are you doing?

1429
01:53:33,975 --> 01:53:35,351
- Button up!
- I'm sorry!

1430
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:37,895
I'm sorry.

1431
01:53:40,106 --> 01:53:41,232
Smoke grenades, now!

1432
01:54:06,465 --> 01:54:09,593
We're going to skin you alive!

1433
01:54:10,261 --> 01:54:12,430
Shut up and send me more pigs to kill!

1434
01:54:20,354 --> 01:54:21,647
Fuck you!

1435
01:54:25,443 --> 01:54:26,610
Bible, grenades!

1436
01:54:30,990 --> 01:54:32,158
Here, take...

1437
01:56:44,331 --> 01:56:46,000
I'm sorry, son.

1438
01:56:50,254 --> 01:56:51,630
It's okay.

1439
01:56:53,716 --> 01:56:55,342
What can you do?

1440
01:57:09,607 --> 01:57:11,233
I did my best.

1441
01:57:12,735 --> 01:57:13,819
Yeah.

1442
01:57:14,445 --> 01:57:16,614
I know. I know.

1443
01:57:30,211 --> 01:57:31,837
Sergeant Collier?

1444
01:57:33,005 --> 01:57:34,590
Yeah, son?

1445
01:57:41,847 --> 01:57:43,515
I'm scared.

1446
01:57:47,061 --> 01:57:48,771
I'm scared, too.

1447
01:57:58,739 --> 01:58:00,366
Oh, Jesus.

1448
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:03,911
Oh, fuck, I want to surrender.

1449
01:58:06,413 --> 01:58:07,998
Please don't.

1450
01:58:09,458 --> 01:58:12,294
- They'll hurt you real bad.
- Oh, fuck.

1451
01:58:14,171 --> 01:58:16,423
And they'll kill you real bad.

1452
01:58:18,676 --> 01:58:20,594
Fuck, what do I do?

1453
01:58:22,721 --> 01:58:24,348
There's a hatch.

1454
01:58:25,015 --> 01:58:26,642
Okay. Okay.

1455
01:58:26,976 --> 01:58:29,061
- Do you see it?
- I see it.

1456
01:58:29,144 --> 01:58:31,146
- You know where it is?
- I know where it is.

1457
01:58:42,366 --> 01:58:43,659
What the fuck?

1458
01:58:51,208 --> 01:58:52,418
Go.

1459
02:03:23,355 --> 02:03:24,690
Easy, boy.

1460
02:03:26,108 --> 02:03:27,442
Easy, now.

1461
02:03:28,318 --> 02:03:29,695
One's alive!

1462
02:03:48,213 --> 02:03:50,799
Easy. Easy, buddy.

1463
02:03:51,174 --> 02:03:52,509
Come on.

1464
02:03:52,593 --> 02:03:54,886
All right, there we go. Okay.

1465
02:03:54,970 --> 02:03:59,141
- You all right? You hit? You hurt?
- I'm...

1466
02:03:59,224 --> 02:04:01,184
You seem all right. Let me take this.

1467
02:04:02,686 --> 02:04:04,688
We'll leave you with that.

1468
02:04:04,771 --> 02:04:06,857
Hey, you're a hero, buddy.

1469
02:04:08,025 --> 02:04:09,693
Do you know that?
