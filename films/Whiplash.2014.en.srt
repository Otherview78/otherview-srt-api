1
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:32,403
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,280
No. Stay.

3
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,162
What's your name?

4
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:42,872
Andrew Neiman, sir.

5
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,623
What year are you?

6
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,751
I'm first year.

7
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:50,087
-Do you know who I am?
-Yes, sir.

8
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:53,049
So you know I'm looking for players.

9
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,343
Yes, sir.

10
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,511
Then why did you stop playing?

11
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,783
Did I ask you to start playing?

12
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,660
-Sorry, 
I--
-1 asked why you stopped playing...

13
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,872
...and your answer was to turn
into a wind-up monkey.

14
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:27,875
-Sorry, I thought--
-Show me your rudiments.

15
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:29,627
Yes, sir.

16
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,176
Double-time swing.

17
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,306
No, double-time. Double it.

18
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:45,559
Faster. Faster.

19
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,496
Oopsy-daisy.

20
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,540
Forgot my jacket.

21
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,162
-No Swedish Fish?
-No, not today.

22
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:31,790
Thanks.

23
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:44,845
-You okay?
-Yeah.

24
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,980
Yeah. Well, I don't know.
He saw me play today.

25
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,942
And?

26
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:04,323
Well, you got plenty of options still.

27
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:06,575
-What does that mean?
-Just...

28
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,577
-Other options?
-Just, you know...

29
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,039
It's just life.

30
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:15,501
Listen, when you get to be my age,
you get perspective.

31
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,295
I don't want perspective.

32
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,797
Sorry.

33
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:26,929
All right.

34
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,641
I don't want the Raisinets.

35
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:33,477
Why didn't you say that?

36
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:35,813
I just eat around them.

37
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,484
I don't understand you.

38
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,355
Bye. I'll see you later. Bye.

39
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,533
My man, Ry. Oh, shit.

40
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:31,243
How you feeling, man?

41
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,245
It's been too long. Been too long.

42
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,748
Things were hurting
with Neiman on the Kits.

43
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:36,999
Come on, man.

44
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,126
-What?
-He's fine.

45
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,837
-If you say so. Good seeing you.
-Yeah.

46
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,172
Yo, looking good.

47
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,008
-Hey.
-What's up?

48
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,885
-Good weekend?
-Yeah, real good.

49
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,470
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Lot of fun.

50
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:50,763
Nice.

51
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:54,308
Hey, don't worry about Greg.
Kid's a dick.

52
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,020
-No big deal.
-Good morning, everybody.

53
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,191
Good morning, everybody.

54
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,901
-Good morning.
-All right.

55
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:08,530
Let's do "Billy Zane" from the top, yes?
Yes?

56
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,909
-How's that? Good?
-Little right.

57
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,036
-One, two, three...
-Okay.

58
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:27,257
Wait.

59
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:30,719
All right, let's do reeds, yeah?

60
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,513
-Three.
-Yo, Ryan.

61
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,057
Watch it.

62
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,184
Yeah.

63
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,353
Accent, yeah...

64
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,070
-Not today.
-Big on the bottom. Put some sugar on it.

65
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,949
You embarrass yourself
like what's-his-face.

66
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,326
That was truly pathetic.

67
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,919
Short.

68
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,758
All right. All right.

69
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,929
That's enough of that. Just back
to the core drums, please.

70
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,973
Core players, let's go.

71
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,645
Dude,
what have you been practising?

72
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,406
May 17?

73
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,877
Cute.

74
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,839
Down the line.
Trumpets, bars seven and eight.

75
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,757
Three, four.

76
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,554
Three, four.

77
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,430
Okay. All right.

78
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,268
Trombone, bar 24. The and of two.

79
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:25,519
Maybe not.

80
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,146
Tenor, let's start the pickup to 11.

81
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,107
Three, four.

82
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:35,237
Same spot. Three, four.

83
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,072
Okay. All right.

84
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:40,701
You're in the first chair.
Let's see if it's because you're cute.

85
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,744
Three, four.

86
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,705
Yep. That's why.

87
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:50,127
Drums.
Let's hear a little double-time swing.

88
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,424
Behind.

89
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,302
Same thing.

90
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:06,643
Bass, five bars of "Donna Lee."

91
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:12,816
All right.

92
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,655
Drums, with me.

93
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,074
Thank you, Joe.

94
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,244
No, no, no. Other drums.

95
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:44,181
Room B-16 tomorrow morning,
6:00 a.m. Don't be late.

96
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,149
All right, everybody, from the top.

97
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,698
A-one, two, three...

98
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,043
-Hey.
-How are you?

99
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,087
-Good. How are you?
-Good, thanks.

100
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,588
Good.

101
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,800
-The usual? You want, like--?
-No.

102
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:23,512
Look, I don't really know how--

103
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:28,517
I see you in here a lot, and
I think that you're really pretty and...

104
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:33,188
Would you wanna go out with me
ever?

105
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,649
Please go away.

106
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:37,734
-Oh, God.
-Get out.

107
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:41,405
-I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
-I'm just messing with you.

108
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:46,159
-I'm messing with you.
-What? Oh, my God.

109
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:47,703
I'm sorry.

110
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,914
-That's actually pretty mean.
-That should've-- I'm sorry.

111
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:53,166
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

112
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,669
-What's your name?
-It's okay. No big deal.

113
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:56,920
Oh, I'm Andrew.

114
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,505
-Andrew.
-Yeah.

115
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,882
-I'm Nicole.
-Nice to meet you, Nicole.

116
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,926
Nice to meet you too.

117
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:07,389
-So you wanna take me out.
- I would love to take you out.

118
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,516
-Where do you wanna go?
-Pizza.

119
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:10,976
-Pizza.
-Yeah.

120
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,021
- I like pizza.
-Yeah, I know this great pizza place.

121
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:17,149
Cool. Okay, well...

122
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,904
I get off at 7 on Monday.

123
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:26,366
-Okay.
-You wanna meet here?

124
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,994
-Okay. Yeah. I will.
-Yeah.

125
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,746
Great.

126
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,956
Okay. Seven o'clock?

127
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,499
-Here.
-At 7 p.m.

128
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,710
-Monday. Andrew.
-All right.

129
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,503
-Bye.
-Bye.

130
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,029
It's not that bad. She's a go-go dancer.
Could've did porn, she chose not to.

131
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,615
-That make it better?
-Yeah, little bit.

132
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,992
-That's classier.
- I can deal with that.

133
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,504
Bitch had a foot fetish or something.

134
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,300
-This is good.
-You get on that?

135
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,178
That's it.

136
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,305
You are fucking kidding me.

137
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,310
-You the new alternate?
-Yeah. I'm Andrew Neiman.

138
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,855
Tune the set to B-flat,
then turn my pages.

139
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,523
Sure.

140
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,194
Excuse me. Could I get a B-flat?

141
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,446
Thank you.

142
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,121
Sorry. Can you--? Just one more time?

143
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,925
That's a great kit.

144
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,760
I play the new cymbals now.

145
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,179
Milk the cunt!

146
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:56,868
We got a squeaker today, people.
Neiman.

147
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:00,288
Nineteen years old. Isn't he cute?

148
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,543
All right, gang, "Whiplash."

149
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,841
Page. Page!

150
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:04,352
Barker, that is not your boyfriend's dick.
Do not come early.

151
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,855
Bar 93.

152
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,609
Five, six, and...

153
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,730
Stop.

154
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:53,568
Now, this one really upsets me.
We have an out-of-tune player here.

155
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,531
Before I continue, would that player
care to identify himself?

156
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:01,993
No?

157
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,913
Okay, maybe a bug flew in my ear.

158
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,749
One-fifteen.

159
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,378
Five, six, and...

160
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,006
No. My ears are fine.

161
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,718
We definitely have
an out-of-tune player.

162
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:22,055
Whoever it is, this is your last chance.

163
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:25,600
And there it went.

164
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,937
Now, either you are deliberately
playing out of tune...

165
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,773
...and sabotaging my band...

166
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,526
...or you don't know
you're out of tune...

167
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,029
...which I'm afraid is even worse.

168
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,283
Reeds.

169
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,119
Five, six, and...

170
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,372
Bones.

171
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,917
Five, six, and...

172
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,921
He's here.

173
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,436
Tell me it's not you, Elmer Fudd.

174
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:25,827
It's okay. Play.

175
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,753
Do you think you're out of tune?

176
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,305
There's no fucking Mars bar down there.
What are you looking at?

177
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,141
Look up here. Look at me.

178
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,271
Do you think you're out of tune?

179
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,320
Yes.

180
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,532
Then why the fuck didn't you say so?

181
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,745
I've carried your fat ass for too long.

182
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,705
I won't have you
cost us a competition...

183
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:13,583
...because your mind's on a Happy Meal
instead of on pitch.

184
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,919
Jackson, congratulations,
you're fourth chair.

185
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:19,547
Metz, why are you still sitting there?
Get the fuck out!

186
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:41,736
For the record, Metz wasn't out of tune.
You were, Erickson.

187
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:43,863
But he didn't know...

188
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,241
...and that's bad enough.

189
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,580
All right, take 10.
When we get back, the squeaker's on.

190
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:04,926
Two, two, three.
Two, two, three.

191
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:09,931
If he put half the effort
into playing the trombone...

192
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,228
Andrew.

193
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,401
-Parents musicians?
-No.

194
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:25,238
-What do they do?
-My dad's a writer.

195
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:26,531
What's he written?

196
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,410
I guess he's more of a teacher, really.

197
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,204
-College?
-Pennington High School.

198
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,043
-Your mother, what does she do?
- I don't know. She left when I was a baby.

199
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,045
No musicians in the family?

200
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,924
You just gotta listen
to the greats, then.

201
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:48,011
Buddy Rich, Jo Jones...

202
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:52,348
You know, Charlie Parker
became Bird...

203
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:55,685
...because Jones threw a cymbal
at his head.

204
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,104
See what I'm saying?

205
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,482
Listen, the key is to just relax.

206
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,068
Don't worry about the numbers.

207
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,821
Don't worry about what
other guys are thinking.

208
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:10,408
You're here for a reason.

209
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,994
You believe that, right?

210
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,996
Yeah.

211
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,333
Say it.

212
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,420
I'm here for a reason.

213
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,299
Cool.

214
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,762
All right, man. Have fun.

215
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,332
All right, gang, "Whiplash."

216
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:03,628
A little under tempo, okay?
Neiman, just do your best.

217
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,757
Here we go.

218
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:10,343
Five, six, and...

219
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,069
Let's hear some fills.

220
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:39,872
We got Buddy Rich here.

221
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,759
A little trouble there.
Just pick it up at 17.

222
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,638
Ready?

223
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:58,433
Five, six, and...

224
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:04,522
Not quite my tempo.

225
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,316
Here we go.

226
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:08,735
Five, six, and...

227
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:14,365
Downbeat on 18. Okay? Here we go.

228
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:16,492
Five, six, and...

229
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,372
Bar 17, the and of four.

230
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,040
Got it?

231
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,460
Five, six, seven...

232
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:30,965
Not quite my tempo.
It's all good. No worries. Here we go.

233
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:33,176
Five, six, seven...

234
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,181
You're rushing. Here we go.

235
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,641
Five-- Ready? Okay.

236
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,227
Five, six, and...

237
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:46,522
Dragging just a hair.

238
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,111
Wait for my cue.

239
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,447
Five, six, seven...

240
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:00,077
Rushing. Five, six, and...

241
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,666
Dragging. Five, six, and...

242
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:33,402
Why do you suppose I just hurled
a chair at your head, Neiman?

243
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,197
- I don't know.
-Sure you do.

244
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,367
-The tempo?
-Were you rushing or dragging?

245
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:42,787
I don't know.

246
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,749
-Start counting.
-Five, six, seven--

247
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,459
In four, damn it. Look at me.

248
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,503
One, two, three, four.

249
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:53,130
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three--

250
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,466
Now, was I rushing or was I dragging?

251
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,010
-I don't know.
-Count again.

252
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,680
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

253
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:03,307
-One, two, three, four.
-Rushing or dragging?

254
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,726
-Rushing.
-So you do know the difference.

255
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,396
If you deliberately sabotage my band...

256
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,439
...
 will fuck you like a pig.

257
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:12,483
Now, are you a rusher...

258
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,235
...or are you a dragger...

259
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:17,071
...Or are you gonna be
on my fucking time?

260
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,323
I'm gonna be on your time.

261
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,368
-What does that say?
-"Quarter note equals 215."

262
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:24,662
-Count me a 215.
-One, two, three, four.

263
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:26,914
-One, two, three, four.
-Jesus Christ.

264
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:28,916
I didn't know they allowed retards.

265
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,419
Am I to understand
that you cannot read tempo?

266
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,422
-Can you even read music? What's that?
-Eighth note.

267
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,841
-Yes. What is that?
-Dotted 16th note.

268
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,426
Sight-read measure 101.

269
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:44,265
<i>What, are you in a fucking a cappella
group”? Play the goddamn Kit.</i>

270
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,642
Stop. Now answer my question.

271
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:50,313
Were you rushing
or were you dragging?

272
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:53,232
-Answer!
-Rushing.

273
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,156
Oh, my dear God.

274
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:03,618
Are you one of those
single-tear people?

275
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:07,705
Do I look like a double fucking rainbow
to you? You must be upset.

276
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,624
-Are you upset?
-No.

277
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,709
No? So you just don't give a shit?

278
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:15,087
- I do give a shit.
-So are you upset? Yes or fucking no?

279
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,298
Yes, you are upset.

280
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,549
Yeah.

281
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:20,927
-Say it.
-I'm upset.

282
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:23,930
Say it so the whole band can hear you.

283
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,600
-I'm upset.
-Louder.

284
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,977
-I'm upset.
-Louder!

285
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:31,520
I'm upset.

286
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:35,107
You are a worthless, friendless,
faggot-lipped piece of shit...

287
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:38,778
...whose Mommy left Daddy when she
figured out he wasn't Eugene O'Neill.

288
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,656
Who's now weeping and slobbering
all over my drum set...

289
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,783
...like a fucking 9-year-old girl.

290
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,911
So for the final father-fucking time...

291
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,538
-...say it louder!
-I'm upset!

292
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:51,582
Carl.

293
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,711
Start practising harder, Neiman.

294
00:29:56,963 --> 00:30:00,591
"Whiplash," bar 125.

295
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,927
Big-boy tempo.

296
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,179
Five, six, and...

297
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,501
This place is nice.

298
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:45,005
Yeah. I really like the music
that they play.

299
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:50,010
-I mean, the food's good too, but...
-No, the pizza's really good.

300
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,264
"When I Wake."

301
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,850
-What?
-That's the name of the song.

302
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:01,355
Jackie Hill, July 17th, 1938.

303
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:03,357
Bob Ellis on the drums.

304
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,071
Every time I saw you at the theatre,
your eyes were glued to the floor.

305
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,948
Really?

306
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:16,453
My dad says that I have--
I have trouble making eye contact.

307
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:20,624
My parents like to criticise me too.

308
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:23,711
Growing up, my mom said
I had a really big chin...

309
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:25,546
...that's why guys wouldn't like me.

310
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,298
-Really? You don't.
-Yeah.

311
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,633
Well, she said my dad cursed me
with one.

312
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:32,178
It's like Jay Leno. Look.

313
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,555
-No, it's not.
-Yeah, it is.

314
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:38,058
- I don't-- I don't think so at all.
-Well, that's nice.

315
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:41,812
Your chin's very nice. Very nice.

316
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:45,024
Your mom sounds insane.

317
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,818
She did wanna be an actress
when she was my age.

318
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,697
-What about you?
-What about me?

319
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,324
What do you do?

320
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,576
I go to Fordham.

321
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:57,620
What do you study?

322
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,080
I don't have a major yet.

323
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:05,211
-But, like, what do you want to study?
- I don't really know.

324
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,254
I don't know yet.

325
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,466
So Fordham
was just like a random school?

326
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:13,552
No, I applied to a bunch of schools,
Fordham let me in.

327
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:14,929
Why'd you pick Shaffer?

328
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,473
It's the best music school
in the country.

329
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,975
Well, Fordham was Fordham.

330
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,491
I don't love it there, to be honest.

331
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,993
-No?

332
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:39,828
I...

333
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,416
I don't know. I guess it's just the people.
I don't know if they like me very much.

334
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,754
I'm from Arizona,
and I think they can see it.

335
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,966
- I feel the same about people at Shaffer.
-Yeah?

336
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,510
Yeah. I don't think they like me
too much.

337
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:57,221
But I don't-- I don't...

338
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,557
I don't care too much.
I think it just-- It changes.

339
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:03,727
You know, people change
and things work out.

340
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,437
No, no, I know, I know.

341
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,773
I just...

342
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:12,611
I feel really homesick sometimes.

343
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:17,032
I don't know.

344
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:22,329
It kind of pisses me off
when people pretend like they're not.

345
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:24,665
In college, you know?

346
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:28,711
Maybe I'm literally the only one,
I don't know.

347
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,717
I still go to the movies with my dad.

348
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:09,043
-Hey. How are you, man?
-Good to see you.

349
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:13,422
And please, is this really Eva?

350
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:17,134
Last time I saw you,
you were very tiny.

351
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:19,428
Are you playing an instrument yet?

352
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:20,971
She started piano last week.

353
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,308
When you're a big college kid,
will you come play in my band?

354
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,477
-Would you like that?
-Be my piano player?

355
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,187
Excellent. Give me five, baby.

356
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,314
-All right. Great to see you.
-Great seeing you.

357
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,441
-See you after the show.
-Absolutely.

358
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,109
Cheers.

359
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,280
Listen up, cocksuckers.

360
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:40,824
Hurry the fuck up. Get your music.

361
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,122
"Irene” only. Set one.
Rhythm section out first.

362
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:50,959
The kit is a fucking tonal catastrophe.
Get it in tune, all right?

363
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:53,295
Rhythm and soloists, bar 45.

364
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:55,047
We're gonna pick up the tempo.

365
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:59,301
Bar 106, brass, do not forget
we sharp that ninth.

366
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,888
Everybody remember,
Lincoln Center use these competitions...

367
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:05,557
...10 decide who they're interested in
and who they're not.

368
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:09,103
I'm not gonna have my reputation
in that department tarnished...

369
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:11,438
...by a bunch of limp-dick, sour-note...

370
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:14,817
...flatter-than-their-girlfriends,
flexible-tempo dip shits.

371
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,819
One more thing. Give me that.

372
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,613
If I ever find one of these
lying around again...

373
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:23,492
...I swear to fucking God,
I will stop being so polite.

374
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,079
Get the fuck out of my sight
before I demolish you.

375
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:29,123
Stage right, in order, now.

376
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,210
I can still fucking see you, Mini-Me!

377
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:47,349
Let's go. Hurry the fuck up. Let's go.

378
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,905
The Shaffer Conservatory
Studio Band.

379
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:00,130
Hold on to this for the second set.

380
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,265
He's dumb but he's not stupid.

381
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:13,185
At the end of the day, he wants a career,
as dumb as he is.

382
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:17,272
Fudd has a chance of getting put back in,
so why would he jeopardise that?

383
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:19,983
- I need to look at the music.
-It's right here.

384
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,571
-Why isn't it on you?
-Where's the folder?

385
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:28,325
-You're joking. You're fucking around?
-No--

386
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:31,954
I swear I had it here two seconds ago.
It's gotta be around here.

387
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:34,289
-Did you see--?
-How could you be so stupid?

388
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:36,875
- I know. Maybe a janitor came by.
-A janitor?

389
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,628
Find the fucking folder!
A fucking janitor?

390
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:43,340
You're a dumb fuck! A dumb fuck!

391
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:45,467
-Find the folder!
-Okay, I'm sorry.

392
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:47,469
Tanner!

393
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,310
Jesus fucking Christ,
where have you been?

394
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,230
-We have an issue.
-Okay, now is not the time.

395
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:01,858
I gave Neiman the folder
and Neiman lost it.

396
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,319
-Neiman lost it.
-Yes, sir.

397
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:06,446
The folder was your responsibility.

398
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,865
Why would you give it to Neiman?
Right?

399
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:12,369
Give a calculator to a retard,
he's gonna turn on a TV with it.

400
00:40:12,578 --> 00:40:15,956
-Get your sticks, get your ass on-stage.
-I-- I can't.

401
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,083
You can't?

402
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:22,629
I-- I can't go on-stage.
I don't know the charts by heart.

403
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:27,593
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-I-- You know this.

404
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,429
I need the music.
It's my memory, I need visual cues.

405
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,556
-Visual cues.
-Yes. It's a medical--

406
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:34,891
A medical condition?
What, are you Sanjay Gupta?

407
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,351
Play the goddamn music.

408
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,854
-I can't.
-I can.

409
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:46,653
-You know "Whiplash" by heart?
-Yes. Every measure.

410
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:53,327
All right. Well, you better fucking hope
your memory doesn't fail you.

411
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:56,663
I hope you play it a lot better
than you did last month.

412
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,707
I do not intend to start losing.

413
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,752
Get your sticks and get your ass
on-stage. On-stage!

414
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:29,131
And in first place...

415
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,216
...Shaffer Conservatory.

416
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:47,566
Hey.
Don't fucking touch my folder, man.

417
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,619
Do not touch this kit.

418
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,960
All right, let's get to work, ladies.

419
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:11,298
Tanner, what you doing? It's core only.
I don't have time for alternates.

420
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:16,261
"Cherokee." From the top.

421
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:29,024
Tanner, are you a fucking statue?
Let's go. Get off the stool.

422
00:43:35,906 --> 00:43:39,493
Don't forget to turn Neiman's pages.
Here we go.

423
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:42,329
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four.

424
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:05,268
What did you do to your hand?

425
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:08,021
-Is that from drumming?
-Yeah. It's nothing.

426
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,315
So how's it going
with the Studio Band?

427
00:44:10,524 --> 00:44:11,566
Good.

428
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:13,735
Yeah, I think he likes me more now.

429
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,281
And his opinion means a lot to you,
doesn't it?

430
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:20,700
Yeah.

431
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:24,746
Wanna grab the shakers?

432
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,750
Jimbo? Overcooked.

433
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:30,919
You can barely chew this.

434
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:34,965
-He just laughs.
-So how's the drumming going, Andy?

435
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:39,135
Yeah, it's going really well.
I'm the new core drummer, so--

436
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:42,848
-Hey.
-Congratulations.

437
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,516
Tom Brady.

438
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:47,435
-Did you hear, Jim?
-No, what?

439
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:50,939
-Trav got named this year's MVP.
-That's fantastic, Travis.

440
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,608
Yeah, and Dustin is heading up
Model UN...

441
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:56,611
...soon to be Rhodes Scholar
and who knows what else.

442
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:58,905
And Jim, teacher of the year.

443
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:00,907
-Well, hey, listen--
- I mean, come on.

444
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:03,451
The talent at this table,
that is stunning.

445
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:07,914
-And Andy, with your drumming.
-It's going okay, Andy?

446
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:10,584
Yeah, it's going really,
really well, actually.

447
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,086
I'm part of Shaffer's
top jazz orchestra...

448
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,839
...which means
it's the best in the country.

449
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,216
And I'm a core member...

450
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:21,011
...So I'll start playing in competitions.
I just--

451
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,722
I found out I'm the youngest person
in the band.

452
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,767
How do you know who wins in
a music competition? Isn't it subjective?

453
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:30,854
-No.
-Does the studio get you a job?

454
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:32,731
It's not an actual studio.

455
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:35,817
It's the name of the ensemble,
but it's a big step forward in my career.

456
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:39,195
I'm so glad you figured it out.
It's a nasty business, I am sure.

457
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:42,490
Hey, are you gonna tell them
about your game this week?

458
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:46,036
-Living up to your title.
-I scored a 93-yard touchdown.

459
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,954
School record, school record.

460
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:51,124
-Is that true? That's fantastic.
-It's Division Three.

461
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:58,548
It's Carlton football. It's not even
Division Two, it's Division Three.

462
00:45:59,633 --> 00:46:01,551
-You got any friends, Andy?
-No.

463
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,679
-Oh, why is that?
- I don't know. I never saw the use.

464
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:08,850
Who are you gonna play with otherwise?
Lennon and McCartney were buddies.

465
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:12,479
Charlie Parker didn't know anybody
till Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.

466
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,022
That's your idea of success?

467
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,817
Being the greatest musician of the 20th
century is anybody's idea of success.

468
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:20,445
Dying broke and drunk
and full of heroin...

469
00:46:20,654 --> 00:46:23,114
...at the age of 34
is not my idea of success.

470
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:26,409
I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34
and have people talk about me...

471
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:30,747
...than live to be rich and sober at 90
and nobody remember who I was.

472
00:46:30,914 --> 00:46:33,208
But your friends will remember you,
that's the point.

473
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:35,794
None of us were friends
with Charlie Parker. That's the point.

474
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:39,756
Travis and Dustin, they have plenty
of friends and plenty of purpose.

475
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:42,050
They'll make great
school board presidents.

476
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:43,969
You think you're better than us?

477
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:47,013
-Catch on quick. Are you in Model UN?
- I got a reply for you.

478
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:50,141
You think Carlton football is a joke?
Come play with us.

479
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,727
Four words you will never hear
from the NFL.

480
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:55,772
-Who wants dessert?
-Heard from Lincoln Center?

481
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:32,267
Okay, get out of here. Pick up the new
chart by the door on your way out.

482
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:37,605
Rehearsal 9 p.m. sharp tonight.
That's how long you have to learn it.

483
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:45,238
Neiman. Stick around a minute.

484
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:52,078
See the tempo marking on there?

485
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:55,457
"Quarter note equals 330."

486
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,293
That is a double-time swing.

487
00:47:58,752 --> 00:48:01,963
-That's what got you in here, right?
-Oh, yeah.

488
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:06,634
As fate would have it,
I recently stumbled across another kid...

489
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:10,305
...in the practice room
working on his double-time swing.

490
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,474
So I'm gonna give him a shot.

491
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,977
-Am I late?
-Perfect timing.

492
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:18,021
Come on in, Connolly.

493
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:21,483
-You two know each other, right?
-Yeah, Nassau band.

494
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:22,734
What's up, Andrew?

495
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:27,947
I've made Neiman a temporary core,
but with this competition coming up...

496
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:31,576
...
 just wanna make very sure
this chart is in the best shape it can be.

497
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:33,703
Yeah, this one right here, right?

498
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:38,458
I gave Connolly the chart this morning.

499
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:41,669
All I wanna do is give you both
a crack at it, all right?

500
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:45,006
So, Neiman, go ahead,
jump on the kit, take it from the top.

501
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:46,674
Okay.

502
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:52,514
I don't want you to worry about hits now.
Just tempo, okay?

503
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,229
All set?

504
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:02,398
One, two...

505
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:10,490
Not quite my tempo. Connolly.

506
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:13,409
- I can take it from the top.
-Connolly, go ahead.

507
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:16,704
-I can do...
-No. We'll go with Connolly now.

508
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:24,295
Hey, do you mind?

509
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:32,846
Okay, man, ready?

510
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:35,890
One and two and...

511
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,274
-Perfect, Connolly.
-Oh, my God.

512
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,527
See, this to me
is the beauty of Studio Band.

513
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:50,405
You walk in here an alternate,
you could be the new core.

514
00:49:50,572 --> 00:49:52,615
-Oh, my God, are you serious?
-Thanks.

515
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,868
That shit?

516
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:00,373
Fletcher.

517
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:03,960
Thanks, man. Here you go.

518
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:07,630
Don't worry about Fletcher.
He's more bark than bite.

519
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,514
Hey, look, you--
I can play these charts.

520
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:19,893
-Now is not the time, I swear to God.
-I can play it, okay?

521
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:23,521
I said not now!
If you want the fucking part, earn it.

522
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:45,001
I'm just gonna lay it out there.

523
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:47,879
This is why I don't think
we should be together.

524
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:52,217
And I've thought about it a lot,
and this is what's gonna happen.

525
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:54,719
I'm gonna keep pursuing
what I'm pursuing.

526
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:57,722
Because I'm doing that,
it's gonna take up my time.

527
00:50:57,931 --> 00:51:00,266
I'm not gonna be able
to spend time with you.

528
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:02,936
Even when I do,
I'm gonna be thinking about drumming.

529
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:07,065
About jazz, my charts. Because of that,
you're gonna start to resent me.

530
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:11,569
You're gonna tell me to ease up on
the drumming, spend more time with you.

531
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:16,324
I'm not gonna be able to do that. I'll start
to resent you for even asking me to stop.

532
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:19,869
We're just gonna start to hate
each other. It's gonna be ugly.

533
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:21,955
And so for those reasons...

534
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:25,166
...I'd rather just, you know,
break it off clean.

535
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:35,009
Because I wanna be great.

536
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:39,347
And you're not?

537
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,684
I wanna be one of the greats.

538
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:47,063
And I would stop you from doing that?

539
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,024
Yeah.

540
00:51:52,235 --> 00:51:54,404
You know I would stop you
from doing that?

541
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:56,948
You know that for a fact?

542
00:51:57,115 --> 00:51:58,616
Yes.

543
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,788
And I'd barely see you anyway?

544
00:52:05,915 --> 00:52:08,209
-Yeah.
-I see you, you'd treat me like shit...

545
00:52:08,418 --> 00:52:10,962
...because I'm some girl
who doesn't know what she wants.

546
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,799
You have a path, you're going
to be great, I'm gonna be forgotten...

547
00:52:15,008 --> 00:52:17,510
...and you won't be able
to give me the time of day...

548
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:20,638
...because you have bigger things
to pursue.

549
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:24,434
That's exactly my point.

550
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,894
What the fuck is wrong with you?

551
00:52:29,439 --> 00:52:31,399
You're right.
We should not be dating.

552
00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:41,284
I'm okay. Thanks.

553
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,632
Fuck! Fuck!

554
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,111
Fucking piece of shit!

555
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,905
Fuck you!

556
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,573
Fuck!

557
00:53:21,074 --> 00:53:23,451
Fucking piece of shit! Come on!

558
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:42,136
Sorry, we have a new player.
Ryan Connolly.

559
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:48,518
I'm sorry.

560
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:51,479
Guys, just put your instruments
down for a minute.

561
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,662
Just listen for a minute.

562
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:14,627
Six years ago...

563
00:54:16,129 --> 00:54:20,216
...
 came across a kid in a practice room
working on his scales.

564
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:25,596
He was early second year and he'd
started at Shaffer with a lot of hope.

565
00:54:28,391 --> 00:54:30,309
Like all you guys.

566
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:37,525
But the truth was that he barely
squeaked in to begin with...

567
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:42,321
...and he was really struggling.

568
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:50,121
The faculty were all telling him,
"Maybe this isn't for you."

569
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:54,250
But they didn't see what I saw.

570
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:57,378
This scared, skinny kid...

571
00:54:57,587 --> 00:55:01,174
...cursing himself
because he couldn't get his scales right.

572
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:03,718
I saw a drive in him.

573
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:06,596
And I put him in Studio Band.

574
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:08,556
And when he graduated...

575
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:12,018
...Marsalis made him third trumpet
at Lincoln Center.

576
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,770
A year later, he was first.

577
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:17,064
That's who you're listening to now.

578
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:21,319
His name was Sean Casey.

579
00:55:29,327 --> 00:55:31,746
I found out this morning...

580
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:34,665
...that Sean...

581
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:38,836
...died yesterday...

582
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:42,798
...in a car accident.

583
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:48,513
And I just...

584
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:53,601
I wanted you guys to know
he was a beautiful player.

585
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:02,527
I just thought you should know.

586
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:11,911
I'm sorry.

587
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,625
Okay.

588
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:26,425
Let's get to work, huh?
How about "Caravan," bar 105?

589
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:34,058
Two bars for free.

590
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:36,269
One and two and...

591
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:43,359
It's not quite right, Connolly.

592
00:56:44,986 --> 00:56:46,654
I'd like to try Neiman on this.

593
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:54,412
Maybe now's the time
for Neiman to earn the part.

594
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:00,876
One and two and...

595
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:05,965
Nope, I guess not. Tanner?

596
00:57:16,726 --> 00:57:18,477
One and two and...

597
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,063
Motherfucker!

598
00:57:23,316 --> 00:57:26,027
Connolly,
get your ass back on the kit.

599
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:35,870
We will stay here for as long as it takes
until one of you faggots can play in time.

600
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:38,539
One and two and...

601
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:43,586
Looks like that might be all night.
Neiman.

602
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:48,341
One and two and...

603
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:50,092
Not my fucking tempo!

604
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:55,973
Sorry, guys.
Hate to put you through this.

605
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,561
If you need to fucking take a dump
or get a coffee...

606
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,480
...whatever,
now might be a good time.

607
00:58:02,647 --> 00:58:06,442
We're gonna stay until I find a drummer
who can fucking play in time.

608
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:09,236
I apologise to the musicians.

609
00:58:09,445 --> 00:58:12,531
Seriously, take 10, 20,
a fucking hour.

610
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:16,077
You hear me, cocksuckers?
Better start shitting me perfect 400s.

611
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:18,412
Connolly, get your fucking ass
back on the Kit.

612
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:38,015
Is that really the fastest you can play,
you worthless Hymie fuck?

613
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:42,353
<i>No wonder Mommy ran out on you.
Get off the fucking kit.</i>

614
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:50,319
And here comes Mr. Gay Pride
of the Upper West Side himself.

615
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:54,782
This is not a Bette Midler concert.
We will not be serving baked Alaska...

616
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:57,952
...So just play faster
than you give hand jobs, will you?

617
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,121
One, two, one, two.

618
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,250
Not even fucking close.

619
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,919
Let's go with the Irish Mick
Paddy cracker now.

620
00:59:07,128 --> 00:59:10,214
You know, you actually do look
quite a bit like a leprechaun.

621
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:12,133
I'm gonna start
calling you Flannery.

622
00:59:33,446 --> 00:59:35,156
Get off!

623
00:59:38,743 --> 00:59:41,203
What are you looking for?
There's no gold down there.

624
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:42,872
Adjusting the seat? Really?

625
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,583
That's been your problem
the whole time? The seat height?

626
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,334
So now you have it, right?

627
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:49,253
Go.

628
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:56,051
Bullshit! Fuck you!

629
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:58,262
Neiman.

630
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:04,351
Maybe it's time...

631
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,855
...to finally bring this home.
What do you say?

632
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,732
Show me.

633
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:14,570
Don't slow down.

634
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:19,825
Pick it up.

635
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:23,120
Faster!

636
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:41,931
Faster!

637
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:50,022
Faster!

638
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:53,859
Faster!

639
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,070
Faster!

640
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:05,913
Keep playing!

641
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:11,752
Keep playing! Keep playing!
Keep playing!

642
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:15,422
Don't stop.

643
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:33,691
Neiman...

644
01:01:35,276 --> 01:01:36,485
...you earned the part.

645
01:01:39,697 --> 01:01:43,117
Alternates, you wanna clean
the blood off my drum set?

646
01:01:46,245 --> 01:01:48,455
Okay, we can start now.

647
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:14,064
5 p.m. call tomorrow in Dunellen.

648
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:18,360
Give yourselves at least two hours
to get there this time, all right?

649
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:20,279
Save your travel receipts.

650
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:23,365
Or don't. I don't give a shit.

651
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:31,767
-Do you know where the cabs are?
-You gotta call the cabs.

652
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:34,853
-The cab was supposed to be here.
-You gotta call. They take forever.

653
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:36,397
How do I get to Hargrove?

654
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,614
Hey. Come on.
Please, come on. You're still open.

655
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:48,534
You're still open.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

656
01:04:04,425 --> 01:04:05,467
Yeah, hello?

657
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:08,012
Neiman, where are you, man?
Call time was 5.

658
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:11,056
I know, I know.
I'm almost there. I'm right there.

659
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:13,142
-We're on-stage in 20.
- I know.

660
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:15,936
-Fletcher's got Connolly warming up.
-God fucking da-- Okay.

661
01:04:16,145 --> 01:04:19,898
You just tell that little fucking redhead
I'll-- I'm gonna be there, okay? Fuck.

662
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:23,902
Hey. Hey. Sorry I'm late.

663
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:27,364
Well, glad you could fit us
into your busy schedule, darling.

664
01:04:27,573 --> 01:04:29,533
I'm sorry I'm late. I'm ready to go.

665
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:32,286
-Connolly's playing the part.
-Like fucking hell.

666
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:33,954
What the fuck
did you say to me?

667
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:38,208
It's my part.

668
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:41,086
It's my part and I decide
who to lend it to.

669
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:45,174
Usually it's somebody
that has fucking sticks.

670
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:49,261
I left them in the car.
I'll be right back. Five minutes.

671
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:50,763
I'm warming up the band now.

672
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:54,391
-I can use Ryan's sticks.
-Neiman, you lost the fucking part.

673
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,477
No, I didn't. You can't do this.

674
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:57,728
-Can't?
-Yeah.

675
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:00,355
When did you become a fucking expert
on what I can do...

676
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:03,400
-...you fucking weepy-willow shit sack?
-I earned that part.

677
01:05:03,609 --> 01:05:06,320
You never earned anything.
You are a self-righteous prick.

678
01:05:06,695 --> 01:05:10,199
The only reason you're a fucking core
is because you misplaced a folder.

679
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:13,702
Only reason you're in Studio Band
to begin with is because I told you...

680
01:05:13,911 --> 01:05:15,954
...what I'd be asking for in Nassau.

681
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:17,372
-Am I wrong?
-Yeah.

682
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:20,000
-I'm in Studio Band because I'm the--
-Back off.

683
01:05:20,209 --> 01:05:22,878
Hey, fuck off, Johnny Utah.
Turn my pages, bitch.

684
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,881
Hey. I can cut you
any fucking time I want.

685
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:29,051
-You would've cut me by now.
-Try me, you fucking weasel.

686
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:34,723
<i>AL 530, that's in exactly 11 minutes,
my band is on-stage.</i>

687
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:38,185
If your ass is not on that stool
with your own sticks in hand...

688
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:40,437
...or if you make one fucking mistake...

689
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:43,565
...one, I will drum your ass
back to Nassau...

690
01:05:43,774 --> 01:05:47,111
...where you can turn pages
until you graduate or fucking drop out.

691
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:51,240
By the time you're done at Shaffer, you'll
make Daddy look like a success story.

692
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:54,618
Got it? Or we can let Johnny Utah
play the part.

693
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:57,704
-You choose.
-That's my part. I'll be on your stage.

694
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,373
-Fuck you.
-You got 10 minutes...

695
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:02,376
...you fucking pathetic,
pansy-ass fruit fuck.

696
01:06:12,344 --> 01:06:14,930
-Tell Fletcher I'm coming.
-What's taking you so long?

697
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:18,392
-We're moving on-stage.
- I got locked in my car. I'm coming.

698
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,227
Left turn, 200 feet.

699
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:22,312
-Are you driving, man?
-No.

700
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:24,064
What the hell was that noise?

701
01:06:24,273 --> 01:06:28,819
Okay, why don't you just tell Fletcher
that I'm coming, you motherfucker?

702
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:14,239
Hey. Hey, hey.

703
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:17,367
Are you okay? Are you okay?

704
01:07:17,576 --> 01:07:20,454
- I gotta get my sticks.
-No, stay away from the car.

705
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:22,623
-I've called 911.
-Look, I gotta go.

706
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:24,833
-No, no, sir.
-A couple more blocks.

707
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:27,294
-Sir, no, you don't have to--
-Please get off me.

708
01:07:58,033 --> 01:08:00,786
-Hey, guy.
-What the fuck happened to you?

709
01:08:06,667 --> 01:08:10,295
The Shaffer Conservatory
Studio Band.

710
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:08,812
Neiman, what the fuck?

711
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:23,368
Fuck.

712
01:09:50,312 --> 01:09:52,022
Neiman...

713
01:09:55,317 --> 01:09:56,610
...you're done.

714
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:09,873
Gentlemen, ladies, I apologise...

715
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:12,959
...on behalf of Shaffer Conservatory.

716
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:19,508
Piece of shit. I'll fucking kill you.

717
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:21,718
-Fuck you.
-Get the--

718
01:10:21,927 --> 01:10:24,262
-Get the fuck off me.
-Get off me. Fuck off.

719
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:29,267
Fuck you.

720
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:31,144
Fuck you!

721
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:33,355
Fuck you, Fletcher! Fuck you!

722
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:36,358
Get off. Fuck. Piece of shit!

723
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,276
Fuck you!

724
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:57,796
-When did you start talking to her?
-Your father got in contact this week.

725
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:00,757
Does the name Sean Casey
mean anything to you?

726
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,552
You know of his death?

727
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:07,264
Last month, he hanged himself
in his apartment.

728
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:15,897
-What does that have to do with me?
-He suffered from anxiety, depression.

729
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:19,484
His mother claims this started
during his time as Fletcher's student.

730
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:24,448
Now, the Caseys aren't wealthy,
they don't wanna file suit.

731
01:11:26,408 --> 01:11:29,453
So, what do they want?

732
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:33,540
To make sure Terence Fletcher is never
allowed to do this to another student.

733
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:00,942
Hey, Dad, look at my paradiddle.

734
01:12:03,278 --> 01:12:05,697
Yeah, that's my boy.

735
01:12:05,906 --> 01:12:09,784
-He didn't do anything.
-What is wrong with you? It's over, okay?

736
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:12,579
He's out of your life.
Why would you let him get away?

737
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:16,124
Would you characterise his conduct
as extreme, Andrew?

738
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,836
Did he ever intentionally inflict
emotional distress?

739
01:12:28,762 --> 01:12:31,515
This would not be a public hearing,
you know.

740
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:35,060
Fletcher would never know
it was you who spoke up.

741
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,692
Why would you do this to me?

742
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:47,072
Do you think that I would let him
put my son through hell...

743
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,699
...and then just walk away scot-free?

744
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:52,661
Don't you know
I would never let that happen?

745
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:57,666
That there is nothing in the world
more important to me than you?

746
01:12:57,874 --> 01:12:59,793
Don't you know that?

747
01:13:10,512 --> 01:13:12,180
Andrew?

748
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:00,895
Andrew?

749
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:07,652
Just tell me what to say.

750
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:21,833
Hey.

751
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:42,687
I'd give anything to be there again
this fall.

752
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:45,106
I like weddings,
provided they're not mine.

753
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:46,733
Marriages are very healthy.

754
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:49,235
Married men live much longer
than bachelors.

755
01:14:49,444 --> 01:14:52,739
They're trying to outlive their wives
so they can be bachelors again.

756
01:14:52,906 --> 01:14:55,742
-Haven't you thought of getting married?
-I did.

757
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:58,286
The young lady changed her mind
at the last moment.

758
01:14:58,495 --> 01:15:01,206
I've been deeply indebted to her
ever since.

759
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:03,750
And I loaded the pantry up
with Gushers.

760
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:06,294
-Saw that.
-Okay.

761
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:08,088
All right.

762
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:10,799
Thanks.

763
01:17:30,814 --> 01:17:32,357
Right on, man.

764
01:17:51,668 --> 01:17:53,253
Andrew.

765
01:17:58,299 --> 01:17:59,759
Hey.

766
01:18:06,516 --> 01:18:08,351
I don't know if you heard.

767
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:11,604
I'm not at Shaffer anymore.

768
01:18:12,397 --> 01:18:15,024
Yeah, I did hear that.

769
01:18:15,775 --> 01:18:17,026
Did you quit?

770
01:18:19,237 --> 01:18:21,114
Not exactly.

771
01:18:22,407 --> 01:18:26,494
Some parents got a kid
from Sean Casey's year, I think...

772
01:18:26,703 --> 01:18:29,581
...to say some things about me.

773
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:32,083
Although why anybody
would have anything...

774
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:35,253
...other than peaches and cream
to say about me is a mystery.

775
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:38,840
Yeah.

776
01:18:39,507 --> 01:18:41,342
-That's a good laugh, right?
-I'm sorry.

777
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:43,303
-No, listen-- I get it.
-I'm sorry.

778
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:45,471
I know I made enemies.

779
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:49,267
I'm conducting a little, though.

780
01:18:50,602 --> 01:18:53,605
They brought back the JVC Fest
this year.

781
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:56,858
They got me opening
in a couple of weeks with a pro band.

782
01:18:57,901 --> 01:18:59,611
That's great.

783
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:02,614
Yeah. It's all right.

784
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:10,079
Truth is,
I don't think people understood...

785
01:19:10,288 --> 01:19:12,957
...what it was I was doing at Shaffer.

786
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:14,792
I wasn't there to conduct.

787
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:18,546
Any fucking moron can wave his arms
and keep people in tempo.

788
01:19:18,755 --> 01:19:23,301
I was there to push people
beyond what's expected of them.

789
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:27,138
I believe that is...

790
01:19:28,556 --> 01:19:31,059
...an absolute necessity.

791
01:19:32,727 --> 01:19:36,105
Otherwise, we're depriving the world
of the next Louis Armstrong.

792
01:19:36,314 --> 01:19:37,732
The next Charlie Parker.

793
01:19:40,026 --> 01:19:43,571
I told you about how Charlie Parker
became Charlie Parker, right?

794
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:46,574
-Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.
-Exactly.

795
01:19:46,783 --> 01:19:48,952
Parker's a young kid,
pretty good on the sax.

796
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:53,748
Gets up to play at a cutting session,
and he fucks it up.

797
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:57,752
And Jones nearly decapitates him for it.

798
01:19:57,961 --> 01:20:00,588
And he's laughed off-stage.

799
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,592
Cries himself to sleep that night,
but the next morning, what does he do?

800
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:06,719
He practises.

801
01:20:07,053 --> 01:20:10,848
And he practises and he practises
with one goal in mind...

802
01:20:11,057 --> 01:20:13,643
...never to be laughed at again.

803
01:20:13,977 --> 01:20:18,815
And a year later, he goes back to
the Reno and he steps up on that stage...

804
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:22,527
...and plays the best motherfucking solo
the world has ever heard.

805
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:28,700
So imagine if Jones had just said:

806
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:33,997
"Well, that's okay, Charlie.
That was all right. Good job."

807
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:39,210
And then Charlie thinks to himself,
"Well, shit, I did do a pretty good job."

808
01:20:40,086 --> 01:20:41,254
End of story.

809
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:43,131
No Bird.

810
01:20:45,008 --> 01:20:48,636
That, to me, is an absolute tragedy.

811
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,973
But that's just
what the world wants now.

812
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:55,351
People wonder why jazz is dying.

813
01:20:59,564 --> 01:21:03,735
I tell you, man,
and every Starbucks "jazz" album...

814
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:06,362
...just proves my point, really.

815
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:11,909
There are no two words
in the English language more harmful...

816
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:13,953
...than "good job."

817
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:20,418
But is there a line?

818
01:21:21,419 --> 01:21:25,173
You know, maybe you go too far and
you discourage the next Charlie Parker...

819
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:29,385
-...from ever becoming Charlie Parker.
-No, man, no.

820
01:21:29,594 --> 01:21:32,972
Because the next Charlie Parker
would never be discouraged.

821
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:34,766
Yeah.

822
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:42,857
The truth is, Andrew...

823
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:47,236
...I never really had a Charlie Parker.

824
01:21:50,073 --> 01:21:51,949
But I tried.

825
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:55,495
I actually fucking tried.

826
01:21:55,703 --> 01:21:57,663
And that's more than most people
ever do.

827
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:03,044
And I will never apologise
for how I tried.

828
01:22:16,474 --> 01:22:17,642
I'll see you later.

829
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,018
Yeah.

830
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:24,607
Hey, Andrew. Listen, I have no idea
how you're gonna take this...

831
01:22:24,816 --> 01:22:30,988
...but the band I'm leading for JVC,
my drummer is not cutting it.

832
01:22:32,532 --> 01:22:34,575
You understand what I'm saying?

833
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:37,662
No.

834
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:40,123
I'm using the Studio Band playlist.

835
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:43,709
You know, "Caravan," "Whiplash."

836
01:22:44,544 --> 01:22:46,629
I need somebody
who really knows those charts.

837
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:52,176
What about Ryan Connolly?

838
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:55,888
All Connolly ever was to me
was incentive for you.

839
01:22:57,473 --> 01:23:00,977
-Tanner?
-Tanner switched to premed.

840
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:03,521
I guess he got discouraged.

841
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:07,441
Hey.

842
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:10,403
Take the weekend. Think about it.

843
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:35,178
-Hello?
-Hey, Nicole, it's Andrew.

844
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:39,640
-Hey.

845
01:23:40,558 --> 01:23:46,731
It's been a while since I talked to you.

846
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:48,816
Look, I...

847
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:52,361
I'm really sorry about everything.

848
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:58,075
I know that's not, you know, enough,
but I'm just really sorry.

849
01:24:03,331 --> 01:24:07,627
But anyway, I got--
I actually have this show this weekend.

850
01:24:07,835 --> 01:24:09,503
It's a...

851
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:13,007
Like, a JVC thing. And I didn't know
if maybe you'd wanna go...

852
01:24:13,216 --> 01:24:18,846
...and we, you know, maybe
get some, like, pizza afterwards...

853
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:23,809
...and, like, complain
about our schools again.

854
01:24:24,018 --> 01:24:26,103
What is--? You said Jayvees?

855
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:29,315
No, it's JVC.

856
01:24:29,523 --> 01:24:33,653
It's like a-- It's a jazz thing.

857
01:24:34,195 --> 01:24:35,613
Yeah.

858
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:37,490
Oh, okay.

859
01:24:38,366 --> 01:24:44,580
Well, I don't know if I can come. 
--
I'll have to check with my boyfriend.

860
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:50,878
Okay.

861
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:52,630
Yeah.

862
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:56,467
Yeah, I'll check, but I don't know.

863
01:24:56,676 --> 01:24:58,928
I don't really think he likes jazz music.

864
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:01,889
Yeah, I mean, it's not for everybody.

865
01:25:04,558 --> 01:25:08,688
Okay. Well, I guess
maybe I'll see you guys there.

866
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:12,149
-Okay.
-Okay.

867
01:25:12,358 --> 01:25:13,776
Bye.

868
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:41,322
All right, gang, listen up. Now,
for those of you who are new at this...

869
01:26:41,489 --> 01:26:45,910
...which looks like everybody except Cal,
tonight could change your life.

870
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:51,540
The folks out there make a phone call,
you could be a Blue Note signee...

871
01:26:51,749 --> 01:26:55,294
...an EMC client,
a Lincoln Center core.

872
01:26:56,295 --> 01:26:57,338
On the other hand...

873
01:26:57,505 --> 01:27:01,008
...if you drop the ball, you might be
looking for a new line of work...

874
01:27:01,175 --> 01:27:05,971
...because the other thing
about these cats is they never forget.

875
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:11,018
We all set?

876
01:27:11,227 --> 01:27:14,063
All right. Let's have fun.

877
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:18,002
You think I'm fucking stupid?

878
01:28:18,669 --> 01:28:21,630
-What?
- I know it was you.

879
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:37,271
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

880
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:41,150
We're very excited to be here kicking off
the JVC Festival this year.

881
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:44,445
I'm Terence Fletcher, these are some
of the best musicians in New York...

882
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:47,406
...which means they're some of the best
musicians in the world.

883
01:28:47,615 --> 01:28:51,660
We're gonna do some old standards,
but we're gonna start with a new tune...

884
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:54,538
...by Tim Simonec called "Upswingin'."

885
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:42,086
What the fuck you doing?

886
01:29:54,598 --> 01:29:55,641
Come on, man.

887
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:02,249
Yeah, I guess maybe you don't have it.

888
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:44,041
That was a little extra avant-garde there
from the rhythm section.

889
01:31:54,051 --> 01:31:56,637
Come on, let's go home.

890
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:07,398
What are you doing?

891
01:32:25,416 --> 01:32:28,085
Now we're gonna slow it down
a little bit.

892
01:32:28,252 --> 01:32:30,212
I'm guessing most of you folks
have heard--

893
01:32:43,767 --> 01:32:44,810
I'll cue you in.

894
01:32:45,018 --> 01:32:47,146
"Caravan."

895
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:51,024
Three, four.

896
01:33:48,207 --> 01:33:50,292
I'm gonna gouge out
your motherfucking eyes.

897
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:36,101
-Andrew, what are you doing, man?
-I'll cue you.
