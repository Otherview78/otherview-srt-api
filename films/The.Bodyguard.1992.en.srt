1
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,868
Stay down.

2
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The Bodyguard (1992)
- 25 fps -

3
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,949
Freeze!

4
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,474
Just freeze.

5
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,795
Your hands ever shake, Frank?

6
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,268
Sometimes.

7
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,958
It's just adrenaline.

8
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,678
Of course.
How did you know?

9
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,589
- Saw him washing the car.
- So did I.

10
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,873
They don't wash cars
on parking levels.

11
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,912
Frank, I'd like you to stay on.

12
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,753
I'm no good in a permanent position.

13
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,911
My feet go to sleep.

14
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,514
Rachel!

15
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,754
You're turning down $2000 a week?

16
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,988
You say you won't protect her
because she's in show business?

17
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,559
No celebrities.

18
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,192
- 2500.
- There's many good men for that much.

19
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,839
Have you talked to...

20
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,150
...Racine? Fitzgerald?

21
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,319
- Portman?
- Portman was interested.

22
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,229
But we heard you were the best.

23
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,638
There's no such thing.

24
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,438
We're talking about a frightened lady
with an 8-year-old son.

25
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,353
I wouldn't be here
if this wasn't real.

26
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,955
She begged me to get you.

27
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,068
Please.

28
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,072
Okay, I'll come.

29
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,476
I'll look it over.

30
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,634
If I take it...

31
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,718
...it's 3000 a week.

32
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,837
You must be very deadly
for 3 grand a week.

33
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,559
Watch and see.

34
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,949
Shit!
I know it's something...

35
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,838
Better not stand there.

36
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,190
Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron.

37
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,114
<i>What?</i>

38
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,320
Alexander Graham Bell
to see Miss Marron.

39
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,632
<i>Got an appointment?</i>

40
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,159
The atomic number of zinc is 30.

41
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,955
<i>All right.</i>

42
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,753
Yeah, can I help you?

43
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,798
You the man
on the intercom?

44
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,755
No.
Can I help you?

45
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,029
Name's Edison.
I have an appointment.

46
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,193
That was arranged by...?

47
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,159
Mr. Devaney.

48
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,073
Go ahead, Mr. Edison.

49
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,679
What happened?

50
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,913
A doll.

51
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,072
Henry Ford
for Mr. Devaney.

52
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,789
Henry Ford.

53
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,635
Come in.

54
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,395
Playback.

55
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,391
That's what I want.

56
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,437
Glad you came.
I'll introduce you to Rachel.

57
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,552
I bet you loved it.

58
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,997
- Doesn't know great art.
- Frank Farmer's here.

59
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,470
- Isn't this me?
- It's terrific.

60
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,029
Who's here?

61
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,235
The bodyguard.

62
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,074
Rory should be my bodyguard.

63
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,149
Raise your butt
and come meet him.

64
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,273
All right, I'm up.

65
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,153
Frank Farmer...

66
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,589
...Rachel Marron.

67
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,474
You don't look like a bodyguard.

68
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,312
What'd you expect?

69
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,518
I don't know,
maybe a tough guy.

70
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,439
This is my disguise.

71
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,994
His timing's good.

72
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,637
Nicki, Rachel's sister...

73
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,074
...and secretary.

74
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,639
Nice to meet you.

75
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,359
Tony Scibelli.

76
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,711
Sy Spector, publicist.

77
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,154
Can we get you a drink?

78
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,159
An orange juice.

79
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,715
Straight?

80
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,515
Yeah.

81
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,839
This is Bill's idea,
a sudden obsession with protecting me.

82
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,638
Tony's done my security.
We're just fine.

83
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,956
Bill's right.
It's time you took more precautions.

84
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,313
I'm sure the number of nuts
writing fan letters...

85
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,994
...jumps whenever Rachel's
on a magazine.

86
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,118
- Not like this.
- Relax, guys. Relax!

87
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,353
I said I'll do it, so I will.
See what I'm dealing with?

88
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,160
I'll do it, as long as
we understand each other.

89
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,196
- I won't let this alter my life.
- Honey, that won't be a problem.

90
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,955
This household is informal.
We're on a first-name basis.

91
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,589
You'll fit in fine.
You can choose...

92
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,879
...the alarm system for the house,
improved security for the gate.

93
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,473
What else?

94
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,509
I'm safe when I'm at the house.

95
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,274
The main thing is when I go out.

96
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,638
Tony will fill you in.
Don't fall over me everywhere I go.

97
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,350
Most important:
Fletcher cannot be affected.

98
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,956
We'll tell the boy
you've got another function.

99
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,668
I don't want him to think
he's in prison.

100
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,354
So the estate must not be altered.

101
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,477
- Miss Marron.
- Rachel.

102
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,350
There's been a misunderstanding.

103
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,398
If you'll show me the way out,
I'll save us trouble.

104
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,119
You can go by the pool.

105
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,199
Nice meeting you.

106
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,549
Or the door...

107
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,076
Tony, shut up!
Wait a minute!

108
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,958
We shouldn't beg this guy.

109
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,950
Sy, I'm handling this.
Farmer, would you wait?

110
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,910
I should have told you more.
I'm sorry.

111
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,835
- I thought I'd let you two work it out.
- We did.

112
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,073
She's not a bad person. Whether
she knows it or not, she needs you.

113
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,991
You've come this far. Wait.
I want to show you something.

114
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,072
Please, Farmer!

115
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,713
How are you today?

116
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,512
I'm fine.
How about you?

117
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,435
I'm fine.
Do you like boats?

118
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,951
No, I don't like boats.

119
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,675
Why not?

120
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,353
I don't know.

121
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,831
Sure you do.
But you don't want to tell me.

122
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,959
You're a smart kid.

123
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,274
One time I was stuck on a boat
with some people for 4 months.

124
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,475
A lifeboat?

125
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,555
No. It was a big, white yacht.

126
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,397
You're the bodyguard.

127
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,039
What do you know about it?

128
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,873
I've got ears.

129
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,118
I'll remember that.

130
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,029
This is just in the last 6 months.

131
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,709
Ever had these
professionally assessed?

132
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,751
- You were in the Secret Service.
- That's right.

133
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,114
Ever guard the main man?

134
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,754
2 years with Carter,
4 with Reagan.

135
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,353
Reagan got shot.

136
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,034
Not on my shift.

137
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,675
Good.

138
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,633
This could be something.

139
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,077
Do you think it is
the guy who rigged the doll?

140
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,353
Did you tell Miss Marron?

141
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,029
About the doll?

142
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,671
We said there'd been
an electrical problem, a short circuit.

143
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,436
She doesn't need
this kind of worry right now.

144
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,514
What about the police?

145
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,637
No need.
No one got hurt.

146
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,313
The chauffeur did.

147
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,469
That was nothing.
It was just our people there.

148
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,394
I think we should show him the room.

149
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,471
Is this her bedroom?

150
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,672
She sleeps in a room next to Fletcher's.
Sy did this for a magazine.

151
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,957
"Superstars in their boudoirs."
Did you see it?

152
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,028
No.

153
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,159
We found the letter here.

154
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,315
In here?

155
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,512
Someone broke in
and masturbated on the bed.

156
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,035
- She doesn't know?
- You kidding?

157
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,952
It'd really freak her out.

158
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,679
What do you think?

159
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,554
Someone penetrates the house,
jerks off on the bed.

160
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,076
I'd say that qualifies as a problem.

161
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,355
We don't...

162
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,749
What kind of problem?

163
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,799
- The house is wide open.
- Excuse me?

164
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,593
The house is wide open.
You have no clue what security is...

165
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,239
...or how to achieve it.

166
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,596
I'll accommodate your work.

167
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,068
I can't do it like this.

168
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,548
Like what?

169
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,036
Won't be responsible for her safety
if she doesn't know all this.

170
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,113
I'll talk to her.
I'll make her understand.

171
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,638
I'll talk to her.

172
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,154
- She won't give you static, I promise.
- Sure she will.

173
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,390
So what job's perfect?
You're a bodyguard.

174
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,351
<i>It's Oscar time again.</i>

175
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,717
<i>The money's on Rachel Marron</i>
<i>for best actress.</i>

176
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,511
<i>And with the theme song "I Have Nothing"</i>
<i>still big on the charts...</i>

177
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,232
<i>...the versatile actress/singer</i>
<i>might end up having everything.</i>

178
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,833
Why'd you say
you were Edison?

179
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,753
To see how difficult it was to get in.

180
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,515
And it wasn't.

181
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,232
Put it on your arm.

182
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,075
Helps the ache.

183
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,238
You can fill a whole day washing cars
and driving Miss Marron.

184
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,869
That's my job.

185
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,272
We're adding to your duties.

186
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,718
You're my new assistant.

187
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,593
Says who?

188
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,834
I've guarded a lot of people
and I've found one thing to be true.

189
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,153
No matter how incompetent the assassins,
or how much they miss...

190
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,712
...one person always gets hit.

191
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,155
Who?

192
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,194
The cocky black chauffeur.

193
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,558
Put this in the pool.

194
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,748
This gate will be replaced next week.
I'll have 2 cameras here.

195
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,120
A face camera by the call box and
a scene camera on top of this pillar.

196
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,876
I want these trees cut back so
the lights can shine onto the property.

197
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,352
The people who come into the property,
make sure we know who they are.

198
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,197
I want these all cut back.

199
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,115
She paid a lot for the estate,
she ought to be able to see it.

200
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,834
- What're you looking at?
- Frank.

201
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,753
This fence will come around here
and end by the gate.

202
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,031
Come on. Let's go.

203
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,273
Not yet, not yet.

204
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,634
Now brake!

205
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,399
Power...

206
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,878
...and stop.

207
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,799
Come here!

208
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,794
Come here.

209
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,350
That's an unusual tactic
for a guard dog, but it's effective.

210
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,195
You can look around
if you want.

211
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,469
- Sorry to disturb you.
- It's an excuse to rest.

212
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,510
This is my place.
I'm the only one who works out here.

213
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,278
My own ego wall.
No platinum records.

214
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,477
Is this you and Rachel?

215
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,198
When I was a kid,
I put together this band.

216
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,954
We played school dances
and stuff like that.

217
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,675
Rachel joined the act. As you can
imagine, she was quite an entertainer.

218
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,519
Even then she could stop the show.

219
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,990
So I kind of quit.

220
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,437
- Professionally, anyway.
- You never went back?

221
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,757
It was obvious
who the star in our family was.

222
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,430
Lot of work went into this.
A lot of work.

223
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,999
No fingerprints, though.

224
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,835
You think
this is tied to the doll?

225
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,593
Her manager does.

226
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,673
"I have nothing" is a natural,
given the record...

227
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,433
...the movie and all.

228
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,473
I lost track of you
after Washington.

229
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,678
So how's the private stuff?

230
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,873
It's fine.

231
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,109
Big money?

232
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,678
It's big money, right?

233
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,997
You wouldn't want this job.

234
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,237
It's big money! I knew it!
You need an assistant?

235
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,155
I'm due to get out and I have had it
with assholic behavior.

236
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,470
What a scumbag we're covering now!

237
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,837
A walking schlong senator
who shall remain nameless.

238
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,119
- Hellfire Henry Kent.
- Someone wants to pop him.

239
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,828
No surprise, with what
the shithead's been saying.

240
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,957
Yeah, do everyone a favor.

241
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,351
As you know,
we're non-political these days.

242
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,798
I'll send it to Behavioral Sciences.
I'll have an answer in a few days.

243
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,075
Thanks.

244
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,189
Ray, why am I getting
all this cooperation?

245
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,789
- Are you kidding?
- She's a big star.

246
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,349
Important people care about her.

247
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,718
Politics and showbiz,
it's the same thing these days.

248
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,515
There she is.

249
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,591
Can I have your autograph?

250
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,478
Sure you can.

251
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,153
Can we get a photo?

252
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,117
You're her favorite actress.
We've seen all your movies.

253
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,475
Take a good one.

254
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,391
Thank you so much.
She'll appreciate it.

255
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,790
I'm surprised
you didn't plug them.

256
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,435
Help me with this stuff. You sign
"Much love, Rachel" and you sign...

257
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,194
Let me set you straight
on a few things.

258
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,000
For starters, I love this lady.

259
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,116
What I do for her, I do out of love.

260
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,919
I'm not some hired gun
who's here to make her life miserable.

261
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,799
I do things the way she likes.
Her happiness...

262
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,678
...is everything to me.

263
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,518
No problem. I'd like
to know how you handle things.

264
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,799
I handle things fine.
You watch me and you'll learn.

265
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,753
Turn right here.

266
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,235
Is that him?

267
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,754
What's going on?

268
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,228
Short cut.

269
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,033
Want me to do a 180?

270
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,236
No, I want you to slow down.

271
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,714
Go to the house!

272
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,519
Shut up!

273
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,389
Just shut up!

274
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,599
He's through
messing with my life.

275
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,231
I'm getting sick of running up here
every time he steps on your toes.

276
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,115
Farmer, would you come in here?

277
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,318
- He's nuts!
- Guess who couldn't get in yesterday?

278
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,153
Robin Leach.

279
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,792
He speaks to 20 million people
and he can't get in!

280
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,155
With an appointment?

281
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,716
What about brunch at Charlie's?
Rachel goes every Sunday.

282
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,235
She can't do
what she's always done.

283
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,438
"Can't do what she's always done."
He's a fanatic!

284
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,511
Like the guys
he's protecting you from.

285
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,239
Excuse me if I don't faint.

286
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,072
Then think about your son.

287
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,559
What do you want?

288
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,279
I want some peace around here!

289
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,552
We're almost done.

290
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,914
I want to eat brunch
with my friends.

291
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,349
Go on Tuesdays.

292
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,992
Tuesday brunch.
Where'd you get him, Bill?

293
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,391
Louise, you have great stuff.

294
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,159
Take it all, darling.

295
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,672
Yeah, I'll try this on.

296
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,233
Want to come in with me?

297
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,273
Just to be safe?

298
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,834
You probably won't believe this...

299
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,438
...but I have a reputation
for being a bitch.

300
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,918
I didn't used to be.

301
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,115
Get known for being a certain way,
a way people think you are...

302
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,514
...and soon, you get like that.

303
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,158
Guess you can't help it.

304
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,589
You don't think so?

305
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,511
You're an expert on the famous?

306
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,877
- I've seen a few.
- And you disagree?

307
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,995
You can be
as you choose to be.

308
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,754
Takes discipline,
but it can be done.

309
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,074
Is that why you never stay
with your clients?

310
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,595
They too undisciplined for you?

311
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,151
- Or maybe you start caring about them?
- Right.

312
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,431
Can't you answer straight once?

313
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,558
You're too clever for me.
I can't keep up.

314
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,673
Look at me!

315
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,718
You don't approve of me.

316
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,789
Disapproval's a luxury I can't afford.

317
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,555
Don't like your emotions getting to you?

318
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,711
Never mix business with pleasure?

319
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,709
Right.

320
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,276
Will you grab that red jacket?

321
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,919
I'm here to keep you alive,
not help you shop.

322
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,079
Thanks.

323
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,678
- 2 minutes.
- 3, 4.

324
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,753
Wait.
I want to make it really full.

325
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,268
What?

326
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,395
Straight up.

327
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,513
Right there.
Hold it.

328
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,514
Hold it still.

329
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,352
What am I looking for?

330
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,555
Bomb.

331
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,278
Don't worry,
I already checked.

332
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,871
Put it back here a little deeper.
Hold it.

333
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,357
Now turn it. Good.
Now right there.

334
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,036
Wait, pull up there for a second.

335
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,838
Son of a bitch!

336
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,838
I thought it was dinner.

337
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,993
- Are we going somewhere else?
- The Mayan.

338
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,152
- What's that?
- It's a club. Let's go.

339
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,279
- You got to tell me about these things.
- I just did.

340
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,313
Nice suit, Frank.

341
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,231
I want you to keep this.

342
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,793
It's beautiful.

343
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,194
It has a radio transmitter.
The clasp sends a signal.

344
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,956
If there's ever a problem, press it.
I'll know you need me.

345
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,517
Okay, she knows how it works.
Let's go.

346
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,153
Come on, let's go.

347
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,236
Look at this!

348
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,438
Look at this, Rachel.
They don't forget.

349
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,549
Get inside. The show's inside.

350
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,631
Henry, just keep driving.

351
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,475
He's from Paris,
an amazing director.

352
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,952
This is his first video.
Rachel loves it.

353
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,312
This is Sy's idea.

354
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,074
- I honestly thought...
- You said I had an exclusive.

355
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,471
Maybe later. What can I say?
Laurie, how are you?

356
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,314
- You know Paul.
- I know who she is.

357
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,791
She doesn't do these places.
He wants it for the video.

358
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,118
He sent another one.

359
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,831
What do you mean "another one"?

360
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,839
What do you mean?

361
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,116
- They didn't tell you.
- What?

362
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,154
There were some letters before.
Same kind of threats.

363
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,958
We didn't want to worry you.

364
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,316
And somebody got into the house.

365
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,675
In my house?

366
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,717
Let's not get hysterical.

367
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,394
Wait!
While Fletcher was there?!

368
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,392
The house is like Fort Knox.

369
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,959
- Right?
- We should go.

370
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,474
No one could...

371
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,358
No one could what?!

372
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,999
Everyone calm down.

373
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,357
Let's just see how she is.
How are you, honey?

374
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,630
"Watch the door"
means no candy, no flowers.

375
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,355
Is he out there?

376
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,716
- He's here, isn't he?
- Maybe.

377
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,598
We don't know that.

378
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,478
You know he was in my house!

379
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,836
Let's go home. We'll have
to make an announcement.

380
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,597
Fine, Bill, you make it!

381
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,230
You tell them!
They'll tear the place apart!

382
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,315
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

383
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,151
<i>...I'm sorry, but due to...</i>

384
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,914
<i>...circumstances beyond our control...</i>

385
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,388
Wait!

386
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,116
Don't do it.
It's not worth it.

387
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,113
No fucking freak
will run me off stage.

388
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,278
Get it cued up front.

389
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,229
Let's go.
We're on.

390
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,589
We're not coming.

391
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,598
<i>Rachel will not be able</i>
<i>to appear tonight.</i>

392
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,958
<i>Just a minute.</i>
<i>Give me a chance.</i>

393
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,270
<i>Bill Devaney, everybody!</i>

394
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,549
<i>Hello!</i>

395
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,678
<i>Just wanted to stop by</i>
<i>and maybe sing a song.</i>

396
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,876
<i>I hope you don't mind, do you?</i>

397
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,829
<i>All right, thank you so much!</i>

398
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,311
<i>Isn't Billy Thomas the greatest?</i>
<i>Let's give him a hand.</i>

399
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,232
Go for it, Rachel.

400
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,596
<i>Want to see my new video?</i>

401
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,594
Are we having a communication problem?

402
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,191
A communication problem?
I mean...

403
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,359
Excuse me.
I need to keep this aisle clear.

404
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,352
I know what you're saying.

405
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,830
You've got a job to do.

406
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,993
But understand that Rachel does too.
And that's what she's doing.

407
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,429
Out there.

408
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,910
She's so hot now.
This is her time.

409
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,799
If she doesn't get out there...

410
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,519
...she's dead.

411
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,638
Forget the crazy death threats,
if she doesn't sing...

412
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,552
...she's dead anyway.

413
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,799
Handled properly, this thing could be
worth a million in free publicity.

414
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,076
One word!

415
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,834
One word about this in print...!

416
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,872
Come on!
Out of the way!

417
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,875
I'll get it.

418
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,349
Follow me!

419
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,397
Where's the fucking limo?

420
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,834
Go!

421
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,269
Henry!

422
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,078
It's me, Sy!

423
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,033
Stop it!

424
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,508
Fuck!

425
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,478
Keep driving, Henry.

426
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,553
Never done that before.

427
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,112
It's been a long night.

428
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,639
Don't you want to know
why I behave that way?

429
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,869
I know why.

430
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,429
I don't want to talk about this again.

431
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,759
Got you, didn't I?

432
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,277
Bet you wonder what I'm doing.

433
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,392
Didn't know I jog, did you?

434
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,679
Afraid I'll get picked off
in my snazzy suit?

435
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,556
No. I'm afraid
that I'll have to jog with you.

436
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,351
Will you walk with me?

437
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,071
I know this is kind of late...

438
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,039
...but thank you.

439
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,556
I'm glad you're here.

440
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,634
And I'm going to try to cooperate.

441
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,638
That would be good.

442
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,477
Farmer, I have this problem.

443
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,115
This minor little problem.

444
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,669
I'd like to go out
for an evening.

445
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,309
With a guy. Like a date.

446
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,951
But, I can't go out on a date...

447
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,953
...because you have to be with me
every minute.

448
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,115
What if he wants to invite me up
to his place? Will you come too?

449
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,429
So...

450
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,117
...the only thing I can figure...

451
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,076
...is for you to take me out.

452
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,320
That's what I was wondering.

453
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,833
You know?
I mean, what do you think?

454
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,911
Only if you want to.

455
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,518
Only if you want to.

456
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,595
God, this is so embarrassing.

457
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,993
You decide, okay?

458
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,639
Sandy Harris is on the phone.

459
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,555
Tell her I'll call her back.
I'm getting fixed up here.

460
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,834
He didn't look like
he wanted to die.

461
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,516
There's a big difference between
wanting to die and not fearing death.

462
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,748
And so because he had no fear,
he was invincible?

463
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,513
What do you think?

464
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,079
He sure creamed them all in the end.

465
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,836
Yeah, it was a good movie.

466
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,515
How many times have you seen it?

467
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,517
62 times, I think.

468
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,315
- I've seen it a lot.
- You can say that!

469
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,798
Your kind of place?

470
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,674
Your kind of music?

471
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,073
Absolutely.

472
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,109
You figure no one can get by you here.

473
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,638
If someone's willing to swap his life
for a kill, nothing can stop him.

474
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,789
Great!
What do I need you for?

475
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,871
He might get me instead.

476
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,831
You're ready to die for me?

477
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,073
It's the job.

478
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,358
And you do it?

479
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,634
Why?

480
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,239
I can't sing.

481
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,355
Maybe there is some glory in saving
a president, but just anybody?

482
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,669
Like you?

483
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,513
Yeah, like me.

484
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,036
It's a matter of discipline.

485
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,711
I don't trust discipline.

486
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,798
I know at that crucial moment
I'd cop out.

487
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,919
It happens.

488
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,676
But not to you, fierce Frank.

489
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,593
It happens.

490
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,831
Have you ever liked anybody?

491
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,234
What do you mean?

492
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,190
Like me, a girl?

493
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,991
Yeah, a long time ago.

494
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,993
What happened?
Do you mind if I ask?

495
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,514
Mind if I don't answer?

496
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,919
I don't want to pry.

497
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,390
Oh, yeah!
I can see that.

498
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,153
What?

499
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,834
She didn't die, did she?

500
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,312
While you were protecting her
she got killed, right?

501
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,550
God! That's not it, is it?

502
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,756
That's it, isn't it?

503
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,678
Nobody's perfect.

504
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,872
I'm sorry, Frank.

505
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,358
I'm sorry.

506
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,233
No.

507
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,871
Nice try, though.

508
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,989
It was less dramatic than that.

509
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,071
She didn't love me anymore.

510
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,558
Can you imagine that?

511
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,191
No, not really.

512
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,475
So...

513
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,559
...is this a full-service date, Frank?

514
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,310
I'm just asking you to dance.

515
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,233
Come on.

516
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,111
You can dance, can't you?

517
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,280
This is kind of a cowboy song?

518
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,750
Nothing.
It's nothing.

519
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,797
It's so depressing.
Have you ever listened to the words?

520
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,393
- It is kind of depressing.
- Yes, it is.

521
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,992
It's one of those somebody's-always
- leaving-somebody songs.

522
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,514
Don't worry.

523
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,113
Don't worry.
I'll protect you.

524
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,877
It's very quiet here.

525
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,551
You ever going to hang these up?

526
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,918
Maybe when I'm here long enough.

527
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,750
"West Virginia University Football."

528
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,239
Take a look at you.

529
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,880
- What'd you play?
- End.

530
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,958
Were you tough?

531
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,912
No, I was fast.

532
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,239
You were in the Secret Service?

533
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,549
What made you get out?

534
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,599
Money.

535
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,677
Yeah, I can see
your tastes are extravagant.

536
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,075
May I?

537
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,754
Yeah.

538
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,559
Be careful.

539
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,909
You're a hard one to figure out.

540
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,558
A bodyguard must know
very little peace.

541
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,472
Watch this.

542
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,309
I've never felt this safe before.

543
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,430
No one could get by you.

544
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,709
Right now might not be too difficult.

545
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,879
What are you doing?

546
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:16,198
I don't want to get confused
about what I'm doing here.

547
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,672
I'm not confused.

548
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,794
You pay me to protect you.
That's what I do.

549
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,553
Did I do something wrong?

550
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,269
Nothing.

551
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,152
Then what is it?

552
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,631
Do you want me to beg?

553
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,192
What's going on, Frank?

554
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,874
I want to keep straight what my job is.

555
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,998
What is that, exactly?
Making me feel like shit?

556
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,313
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

557
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:05,189
Don't apologize. Just tell me
what I did. I'm a big girl.

558
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,998
You didn't do anything.

559
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,799
It was me.

560
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,039
I got involved with my client.

561
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,475
Your client?!

562
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,479
I made a mistake.

563
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,749
You're not attracted
to your client anymore?

564
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,752
Christ, I told you why!

565
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,877
I can't protect you like this.

566
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,437
So that's it for me?

567
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,515
That's it?

568
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,829
Yeah.

569
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,515
I don't believe it!

570
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,038
Live with it, or fire me.

571
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,879
But I can't fuck you.

572
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,434
She's real mad at you, isn't she?

573
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,591
She doesn't know why
you're being so shitty to her.

574
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,308
I don't like you using that language.

575
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,918
I learned not to react to things
like other people do.

576
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,879
That's my job.

577
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,717
It doesn't always work.

578
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,312
Doesn't always work.

579
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,678
I don't think I understand.

580
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,155
I'm old compared to you
and I don't understand either.

581
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,756
I'm starting to get the feeling...

582
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,718
...that I never will.

583
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,799
Thought you'd like to know.

584
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,190
Everyone said she was a sure thing.

585
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,917
But you already knew that.

586
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:02,273
I am sorry. It was out of line,
none of my business.

587
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,436
<i>It's off to Miami today for Best</i>
<i>Actress nominee Rachel Marron.</i>

588
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,434
<i>She'll give 2 AIDS charity concerts</i>
<i>at the Fontainebleau Hilton.</i>

589
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,511
<i>$1000 a plate, no less.</i>

590
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,196
<i>And it's a brave man who'd deny</i>
<i>she's worth every cent.</i>

591
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:40,397
<i>This is mobile 1 to station 2.</i>
<i>Zero 2, engineering.</i>

592
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,712
<i>Have them do a 14 reference</i>
<i>to presidential suite balcony.</i>

593
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,954
It's okay. They're cleared.

594
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,478
<i>Mobile 2 to Catering.</i>

599
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,555
What a silly job this is!

600
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,999
Okay, we're rolling!

601
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,231
- Showtime, everybody!
- Is this necessary?

602
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,710
Yes, it is.
Let's go.

603
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,670
Quit bitching!
This is the part you do get paid for.

604
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,592
Can you give us
a couple of minutes?

605
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,594
- How do you like our city?
- I love it! I love Miami!

606
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,752
Do you arrange all this?

607
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,799
That's me!

608
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,753
Hello, Frank.

609
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,113
Portman.

610
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,879
It's been a long time.

611
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,189
You working?

612
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:40,072
Not technically, but the governor
may come so I thought...

613
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,197
...I'd give a light check.

614
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,958
Someone else is covering him now.

615
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,959
How old's she?

616
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,679
Maybe 18.

617
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,155
Thank you.

618
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,517
Thank you so much.
Listen, you're so right.

619
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,836
I want you to have a good time...

620
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:10,712
...and drink as much of Ben Schiller's
liquor as possible. Thank you.

621
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,318
I'd call that a step up
from the President.

622
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,952
Probably sings better too.

623
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,675
Handful.

624
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,750
Lost track of you
after the Reagan thing.

625
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,514
Yeah.

626
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,233
Wasn't your fault.

627
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,553
You weren't even there.

628
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,758
I need a drink.

629
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,677
It's orange juice!

630
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,555
Who are you?

631
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:52,995
Greg Portman.

632
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,554
I take it you've met my bodyguard.

633
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,511
We used to work together.

634
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,431
What do you do now?

635
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,908
Same thing as Farmer.

636
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,832
2 samurai, huh?

637
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,632
Are you working now?

638
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,233
Not right now.

639
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,148
Good.

640
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,830
Because I'm the only person
in this room that needs protection.

641
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,159
Come on, let's get a drink.
A real one.

642
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,313
Orange juice, sir?

643
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,756
I've been watching you all
night from across the room.

644
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,591
Why don't you keep watching?

645
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,391
No, I'm not doing this.

646
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,155
You are.

647
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,399
Please go now.

648
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,318
Not right now.

649
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,670
Mr. Portman was just leaving us.

650
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,359
Good night, Rachel.

651
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,353
Shit!

652
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,193
What are you looking at?

653
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:21,114
Probably never had a heavy night
in your whole disciplined life.

654
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,593
Coffee?

655
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:29,237
Farmer, you're
a self-righteous son of a bitch.

656
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,636
Don't you dare judge me!

657
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,190
I didn't tell you
to fuck everyone in the hotel!

658
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,348
Fuck this.
I don't need this shit.

659
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,994
Industrial detergent
matches the traces...

660
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,437
...in the glue.
We'll nail this sucker.

661
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,797
Don't take too long.

662
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,039
It's good money, isn't it?

663
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,593
It's good money.

664
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,836
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

665
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,834
- Where's Tony?
- I thought you were with her.

666
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,870
Thuringer, this is Farmer.
Where's your man at the door?

667
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,756
The door to the suite!
Where is he?

668
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,958
Get someone up here now!

669
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:54,035
He doesn't know.

670
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,429
Where are you going?

671
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,791
Rachel, where have you been?

672
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,230
I went to Bal Harbor to shop.

673
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,790
- Want these in the bedroom?
- Leave them so I can look at them.

674
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:15,350
You had us worried.
You're not supposed to do that.

675
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,958
I'll do what I want when I want.

676
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,633
Besides...

677
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,629
...I'm tired
of hanging around deadbeats.

678
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,475
No offense, Tony.

679
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,158
Once more
and I'm gone.

680
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,995
You remember something:
You work for me!

681
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,595
Where're you going?

682
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,876
To check the route, as usual.

683
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,389
Did Fletcher call?

684
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,394
Gomez!

685
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,156
- What are you doing?
- None of your fucking business.

686
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,674
Move it!

687
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,389
Stick it up your ass!

688
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,520
Don't hurt my husband, mister!

689
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,991
Please, don't hurt him.
He not up to nothing.

690
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,473
I'm sorry.

691
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,196
- Hello.
<i>- Mommy?</i>

692
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,997
Fletcher, is that you?

693
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,639
<i>No.</i>

694
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,189
Listen.

695
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,075
I'm through, Bill.

696
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:42,198
I'll get you back to L.A.
And that's it.

697
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,431
Fletcher's guard will cover you.

698
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,911
She got a call.

699
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:50,232
- I don't care.
- It was him. Same guy!

700
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:54,837
It really shook her up!
She thought it was Fletcher calling.

701
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,514
I know she'll be reasonable now.

702
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,318
Save it, Devaney!

703
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,309
My clients don't have to be convinced
to save their own lives!

704
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,871
Call me when she's ready.

705
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,878
Nothing that's happened between us
matters.

706
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,713
I understand now.

707
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,436
You'll have to believe me
because I won't beg.

708
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,630
It wasn't what he said...

709
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,551
...it was the way he said it.

710
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,673
Frank, I need you.
I'm afraid!

711
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,238
And I hate my fear.

712
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,234
Please protect me.
Protect Fletcher.

713
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,596
If anything happened to him...

714
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,433
I can't.

715
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,229
I can't protect you like this.

716
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,593
It's impossible.
The odds are on his side.

717
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,914
I will do whatever you say.

718
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,871
I'd want to take you
away from here for a while.

719
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,673
I can do that.

720
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,874
It'd mean canceling your concerts.

721
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,233
All right.

722
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,912
No more Sy.

723
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,156
Give Devaney and Tony a vacation.

724
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,158
Okay.

725
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:23,596
You cross me up this time,
I swear I'll kill you myself.

726
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,554
Lake's low.

727
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,031
It'll rise when it thaws.

728
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:35,912
They all in trouble?

729
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,354
Just one.

730
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,912
He likes you.

731
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,072
Is that protecting us?

732
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,359
Yeah, he's a trained noisemaker.

733
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,199
Come here, Foster.

734
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,629
Just what we need.

735
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,589
I don't like big dogs.
They don't know who they're eating.

736
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,559
And this one does?

737
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,678
Yeah, this one does.

738
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,233
Excuse me.

739
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:21,917
Katherine had this place
organized the way she liked.

740
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,318
That's Frank's mama.

741
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,155
Fletcher can't swim very well.

742
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,750
He better stay in the boat, then.

743
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:51,869
So you're a singer.

744
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:53,953
Yeah, that's right.

745
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,837
We're kind of out of things up here.
I'm sorry.

746
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,559
That's okay.

747
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,471
You must be very successful
if you need Frank.

748
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,153
It's quiet here.

749
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,436
Frank spent 6 months here
after that Reagan thing.

750
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,435
Reagan thing?

751
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,912
Frank was gone when Reagan was shot.
He never got over it.

752
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,115
That's...

753
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,355
...the day we buried Katherine.

754
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,073
He's a real rascal now.
You tell us.

755
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,275
I never hit him ever.

756
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,954
That's unusual for my people.

757
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,754
So what happens,
he's 10 years old...

758
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,675
...and he starts complaining to me.
How about that?

759
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,113
I'll tell them
about you stripping in court.

760
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:54,078
I want to hear this.

761
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,355
I don't mind.
I'm proud of that!

762
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,393
Anyway, he starts playing
tackle football...

763
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:06,279
...and one day he says to me
he's afraid of being hit.

764
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,189
Says it's my fault.
"How come you never hit me?"

765
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,032
How about that?

766
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:16,229
He got over it, turned into
one hell of a wide receiver.

767
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,757
He was always like that.
Couldn't stand being afraid.

768
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,755
Something scared him, he'd keep
doing it until the fear went away.

769
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,230
His mama was the same way.

770
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,954
You have a beautiful family.

771
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,828
- Had enough to eat?
- Wipe your mouth.

772
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,674
- You through?
- Save some for dessert.

773
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:42,119
I won't tell them about when you were 13
and discovered girls.

774
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,838
Come on, Frank.
You can run but you can't hide.

775
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,751
I'm black, right?

776
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,038
You know you're white.
Your move!

777
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,271
It's my move?
You're sure?

778
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,795
The last move,
I took your rook.

779
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,308
That's right.

780
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,997
How long has this been going on?

781
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:22,789
3 years.

782
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,634
First year
he had me on the run.

783
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,518
What do you think?

784
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,034
Knight to king-4.

785
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:36,995
City kid!

786
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,956
Son, you come sit with me.

787
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,794
That's it for me, guys.
I'm going to bed.

788
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,912
You're in trouble.

789
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,955
Foster, right here.
Turn around.

790
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,479
Good night, Rachel.

791
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:39,919
Good night, Frank.

792
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,833
Good night, Foster.

793
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,877
It's good to hear you laugh.

794
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,114
Stay.

795
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,396
You're very thorough.

796
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,355
What's with you and Rachel?

797
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,511
One minute she has magnetic hands,
the next she hates you.

798
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,910
I don't know what's going on now.

799
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,515
You follow all her moves this closely?

800
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,878
It's a living.

801
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,033
No, it's not.

802
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,633
You must think my life's pretty sick.

803
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:54,634
You must.

804
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,074
I do.

805
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,951
Then why don't you change it?

806
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,033
Is it that easy?

807
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,399
You're a lovely woman.

808
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,276
But you don't want me?

809
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,960
I'm surprised.
Thorough fellow like you.

810
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,397
Why stop at one sister
when you can fuck them both?

811
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,757
I make my mistakes.

812
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,555
You didn't say no to the boss.

813
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,473
Is this elk?

814
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,473
A deer?

815
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,638
Big.

816
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,429
<i>Jesus loves me</i>

817
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,115
First time I've heard church music
in the midle of the week.

818
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,709
<i>For the Bible tells me so</i>

819
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:26,634
<i>Jesus loves me</i>

820
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,516
<i>Oh, yes</i>
<i>He does</i>

821
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,392
<i>Jesus loves me</i>

822
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,634
<i>Oh, yes</i>
<i>He does</i>

823
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,592
<i>For the Bible</i>

824
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,998
<i>Tells me so</i>

825
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,516
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey, honey.

826
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,033
Where's Fletcher?

827
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,149
He can't swim!

828
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,353
Let me have him!

829
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,313
What were you doing?

830
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,239
You're crazy!
You are out of your mind!

831
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,835
You could have drowned him!

832
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:32,879
I'm sorry.

833
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,469
I got careless.

834
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,797
How will we get the boat?

835
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,077
Put them in there.

836
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,832
Someone's cut the phone lines.
Could be anywhere from here to town.

837
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,753
Both cars are dead.
I don't know how.

838
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,476
Who knows you're here?

839
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:15,388
Don't know.
This place has nothing to do with her.

840
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,230
Maybe it has to do with you.

841
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:23,669
- And we can't walk out of here at night.
- I know.

842
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,232
Let's stay tonight
and walk out at first light.

843
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,556
I was an idiot last night.

844
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:52,240
What'd you think about today?

845
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,190
I think this is no maniac.

846
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,353
He knows what he's doing.

847
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,593
You're right.
He does.

848
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,468
Tell me about him.

849
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,153
Who is it, Nicki?

850
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,309
How do we stop him?

851
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:20,028
- He almost got the baby!
- Who is it?

852
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,599
I don't know.

853
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:22,795
Call it off.

854
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,157
He doesn't even know who hired him.

855
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,233
I don't know who he is.
He doesn't know me.

856
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,872
How did you do it?

857
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:34,835
How?

858
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:37,310
I went to a bar in East L.A.

859
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,834
I asked around
and there was this guy...

860
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,229
Name?

861
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:44,959
- Armando.
- His name!

862
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,114
Armando.

863
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:54,236
He arranged it.
That's all I know.

864
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:56,429
All paid for?

865
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:01,229
Is it?

866
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:04,233
And then some, okay?
Till it's done.

867
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,789
He keeps going until he kills her?

868
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:16,917
- What's the name of the bar?
- I'm not sure. I was stoned.

869
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,673
All right.
How about the letters?

870
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:26,830
The letters came first.
I don't know who's writing them.

871
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:29,640
Shit, but they're reading my mind.

872
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:33,031
Those are my thoughts.
I hate her.

873
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:38,875
It made me think I could do it.

874
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:44,755
But I would never hurt the baby.
I would never hurt Fletcher!

875
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:50,078
- You must stop it.
- We will.

876
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,639
You and me.

877
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,197
Don't you want to know why?

878
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,958
You told me.
She has everything.

879
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,998
What if we can't find him?

880
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,076
Stay here and don't move.

881
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,108
It's me!

882
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:40,434
What's happening?

883
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:41,869
Stay with her!

884
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,312
- Where's Nicki?
- No, stop! I'm the one...

885
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,713
We're all right.

886
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,516
- Doesn't make sense.
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

887
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:21,749
We got him.

888
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:23,879
What do you mean?
Where?

889
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:25,633
<i>Here in L.A. Last night.</i>

890
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:29,190
You should see his locker.
He's obsessed with her.

891
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:33,030
- You sure it's him?
<i>- Forensics say a 100% positive ID.</i>

892
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,478
And he's got a black Toyota 4 x 4.

893
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:39,233
<i>Ray's with him now.</i>

894
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:44,717
You sent her the letters.
We don't need you to admit it.

895
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,234
We know!

896
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,919
We know it!

897
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:52,950
Whoever you got wasn't here last night.
This was a professional.

898
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:56,351
<i>This is crazy.</i>
<i>What do you want to do?</i>

899
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,349
How long can you keep him?

900
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:04,830
All he's done is write some letters.
48 hours. You know the deal.

901
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:08,314
I know.

902
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:19,195
<i>Stringent security surrounded</i>
<i>the funeral of Nicki Marron...</i>

903
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:22,955
<i>...who was shot at a lakeside retreat</i>
<i>by an unknown intruder.</i>

904
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,953
<i>Nicki was the eldest sister</i>
<i>of Rachel Marron.</i>

905
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:30,352
<i>A spokesman for the Oscar-nominated</i>
<i>actress said she was devastated...</i>

906
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:34,639
<i>...and that it cast a pall</i>
<i>over the upcoming award ceremony.</i>

907
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:48,269
You okay?

908
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:53,396
Yeah, Fletcher, I'm okay.
How about yourself?

909
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,793
I couldn't sleep.

910
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,758
It was so scary,
just thinking about it.

911
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,591
You feel scared, Frank?

912
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,516
Everybody's afraid of something.

913
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:15,349
That's how we know we care about things,
when we're afraid to lose them.

914
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:18,839
What are you afraid of?

915
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:24,114
You should try to go back to sleep.

916
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,276
Is it the man who killed Nicki?

917
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,318
Are you afraid of him?

918
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,594
Then what?

919
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,150
What are you afraid of?

920
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,317
I'm afraid of not...

921
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:52,039
...being there.

922
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:01,431
It's late.
Want me to take you up to your room?

923
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,513
You mind if I sit?

924
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:10,233
It isn't over, is it?

925
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,239
So he'll come again?

926
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:17,919
It's possible.

927
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,599
At the Oscars?

928
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,154
Maybe.

929
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:29,119
Back in Squirrel Hill...

930
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:34,957
...I bet my friends 50 bucks each
that someday I'd win an Oscar.

931
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,470
It's very important for them
to see me up there if I win.

932
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:46,199
If each of those pikers comes through,
it'd add up to a lot of money.

933
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:53,597
I don't know, Rachel.

934
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,911
I think it's still dangerous.

935
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:59,232
I didn't get here by doing
the smart thing every time.

936
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:03,949
How about you?

937
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,512
Out there on the edge.

938
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:11,912
Have you done anything
that didn't make sense?

939
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,515
Except somewhere inside you?

940
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:21,793
I know you have.

941
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,834
Because no one gets good without it.

942
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:26,833
And I know you're good.

943
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:33,754
Look...

944
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,835
...I don't know why
this is happening...

945
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:41,108
...but I know it's not your fault.

946
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:45,275
I hope you hear me
because this is how I say sorry.

947
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:48,314
So...

948
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,635
...I'll go to the Oscars
and see if I win.

949
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:55,433
And I won't worry about it at all.

950
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:58,351
I have you to protect me.

951
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,399
That's right.

952
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,274
That's right.

953
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:53,069
We'll go straight to the green room.
Got that, Tony?

954
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:54,594
Tony knows what he's doing.

955
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:59,354
I wish you guys would relax.
Nothing bad's going to happen.

956
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,239
Right?

957
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,558
Unless I lose the award.

958
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,154
What a crew!

959
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:14,837
Screw it.
I'm tired of worrying about it.

960
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:16,758
When your time is up...

961
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,114
...it's up.

962
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:21,359
Right, Frank?

963
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,754
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

964
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,194
You look lovely.

965
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:50,158
- Thank you.
- They love you.

966
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,719
They're going wild!

967
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:54,235
So are you the queen of this night?

968
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,710
Let's hope I'm the queen tonight.

969
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,236
Good luck.
Rachel Marron, everybody.

970
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:09,835
And the award for best
achievement in sound...

971
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:13,592
...goes to Kay Colvin...

972
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:17,196
<i>...and Mychal Smith for "Hot and Cold."</i>

973
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:38,957
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

974
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,476
<i>I want to thank our producers.</i>

975
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:47,836
There is a gap, house left, rows EE, FF.
Get fillers.

976
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:53,757
I just need to tell you
your responsibilities.

977
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:58,395
Now it's Best Sound.
Then a song, then you.

978
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:01,757
At 8:07, you will be presenting
with Clive Healy.

979
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:03,715
Your lines.

980
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:07,157
Teleprompter is straight ahead
and, we pray, working.

981
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:13,433
I understand it's my honor
to escort you on stage.

982
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:17,275
That's right, and I don't like it one
bit that you look skinnier than me.

983
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:18,748
I wish.

984
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,795
How's the Hollywood cricket scene?

985
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:26,716
<i>Coming out of commercial.</i>
<i>5, 4, 3, 2. Cue music.</i>

986
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:29,632
<i>And cue Robert.</i>

987
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:33,517
<i>And enter Robert's monologue.</i>

988
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:35,674
<i>Stand by, dancers.</i>

989
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,832
I heard that the New York economy
is so bad...

990
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:42,197
...that the Mafia has
laid off 5 judges.

991
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:48,277
I'm going to look around,
then come back for her.

992
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:51,272
No more carrots.

993
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:53,638
<i>Did you ever see...</i>

994
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:56,713
<i>...a woman on sound</i>
<i>that looked like that?</i>

995
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,510
<i>She must have been the boom girl.</i>

996
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:02,480
<i>Looked like the</i>
<i>bada-bing-bada-boom girl.</i>

997
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:04,711
<i>If she's working sound,</i>
<i>who's listening?</i>

998
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,598
<i>30 to lighting change.</i>

999
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:16,079
<i>- 20 seconds.</i>
<i>- Cue him the 20 seconds.</i>

1000
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,878
Hi, Frank.
How are you?

1001
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:21,838
What are you doing here?

1002
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:23,712
- On the job.
- Who?

1003
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:26,754
Him.

1004
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:28,428
Short-term gig...

1005
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:30,992
...but profitable.

1006
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:35,715
Frank, I'm sorry about Miami.

1007
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,353
<i>Cue music.</i>

1008
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,155
<i>Cue dancers.</i>

1009
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:53,636
Back to work.
See you at the Governor's Ball.

1010
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:07,236
- Not a bad singer.
- Sounds great.

1011
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:09,710
I want her run out of town.

1012
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:11,110
She's got to go!

1013
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:14,079
Tony, you there?

1014
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:21,798
I have a feeling it's tonight.
He'll go for her on camera.

1015
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:23,109
That's crazy!

1016
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:26,955
That's how he wants it to look.
He's very clever.

1017
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:29,669
I need you to help me tonight.

1018
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:33,151
You can't use that.
There's bad breakthrough.

1019
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,834
I'm going to have to disconnect you.

1020
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:37,035
I'll do it.

1021
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:41,110
You get it back after the show.

1022
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:53,509
What's wrong?

1023
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,909
Ready to go?

1024
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:57,189
Shall we go?

1025
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:02,629
Excuse me, is this necessary?
We have our own man at the door!

1026
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,109
Please.

1027
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:06,671
No. I want him.

1028
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:10,869
Fine!

1029
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,678
Stay alert.

1030
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:18,435
Let us brighten this firmament.

1031
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:38,355
Coming through, please.
How much time do we have?

1032
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:40,671
<i>Resetting staircases.</i>

1033
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:43,039
Scenery coming in.

1034
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:44,872
<i>30 to lighting change.</i>

1035
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:53,117
30 seconds. Don't panic.
Clear this area.

1036
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:01,390
Up, to the right and through.

1037
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:04,279
Clive, up, to the left and through.
You'll meet...

1038
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:05,999
...on the landing.

1039
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,674
Watch your step.
Somebody spilled water.

1040
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:14,834
Shall we?

1041
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:25,274
Try to relax.
You must be excited.

1042
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:27,588
Thank you.

1043
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:34,275
<i>Presenting the Best Song award are...</i>

1044
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:38,149
<i>...Hollywood's newest couple.</i>
<i>England's knight in shining armor...</i>

1045
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:41,153
<i>...and America's queen of the night.</i>

Please welcome
Clive Healy and Rachel Marron.

1047
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:17,432
I know you only came to present.
You'll want to leave when we're done.

1048
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:30,149
<i>No, I'm very interested</i>
<i>in one of the awards tonight.</i>

1049
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,313
Best Actor.

1050
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:36,437
Tonight we've heard 5 songs...

1051
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:39,956
...and the names of their creators.

1052
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:49,189
And I know
you have no personal favorites.

1053
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,552
The Best Song nominees are...

1054
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:57,516
..."Clock On The Wall"

1055
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:05,114

from "Hot and Cold" by Leslie Moraes.

1058
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,069
Let's find out...

1059
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:32,274
<i>...who the winner is.</i>

1060
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:35,353
<i>The envelope.</i>
<i>Shall I do the honors?</i>

1061
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,197
And the winner is:
"I Have Nothing"...

1062
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:51,352
...from "Queen of the Night"
by Nancy Garber.

1063
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:58,953
She's good, Frank.

1064
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:03,669
I'm okay.

1065
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:05,999
I said she's nuts.

1066
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:07,753
I'm okay, all right?

1067
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,278
You make me a raving lunatic!

1068
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:15,792
You going to be okay?

1069
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,195
Yes!

1070
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:19,559
Fucking actresses!

1071
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:23,076
- Where's Portman?
- Who?

1072
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:24,799
Never heard of him.

1073
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:35,278
If you want to be in your seat
for Best Actress, you must go now.

1074
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:39,308
Why don't you go twitch
somewhere else?

1075
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:41,755
Everything's fine.
No one noticed.

1076
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,390
- Everyone's jumping out of their skins.
- Bullshit.

1077
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:47,710
He's making me into a lunatic!

1078
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:50,235
- You should know...
- You're driving her crazy!

1079
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:51,989
I know who it is.

1080
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:53,958
Shut up!

1081
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,516
You've embarrassed me...

1082
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:59,320
...in front of billions of people.
You won't quit!

1083
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:03,435
Wait for Frank.
Honey, please.

1084
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,272
Calm the fuck down!

1085
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:07,033
Is he coming or not?

1086
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,356
I know who it is.
It's Portman.

1087
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:15,555
Remember?

1088
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:17,438
The guy in Miami.

1089
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:20,672
- Yeah, pencil neck!
- Is anyone coming?

1090
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:24,708
After tonight, you're in charge.
He knows nothing about show business.

1091
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,632
2 minutes to Best Actress.

1092
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:29,998
You're an asshole.

1093
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:33,471
<i>To present the Best Actress award...</i>

1094
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:36,188
<i>...we have the man who won last year...</i>

1095
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:39,477
<i>...for his performance</i>
<i>in "South of Waco"...</i>

1096
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:41,631
<i>Please welcome Mr. Tom Winston.</i>

1097
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:53,828
Thank you, Academy.

1098
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,472
- Did you see him?
- No.

1099
01:50:56,720 --> 01:51:00,076
- Go to the other side of the stage.
- What do I do?

1100
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,833
See those people?
They don't need to be there.

1101
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:05,911
That camera guy doesn't...

1102
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:08,196
I'll take care of it.

1103
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:14,672
<i>Rachel Marron for "Queen of the Night."</i>

1104
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:28,198
Hey, I said you.
You!

1105
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:32,310
<i>Rachel Marron...</i>

1106
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,312
<i>..."Queen of the Night."</i>

1107
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:49,554
Go to commercial.

1108
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,074
He's got a gun!

1109
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,075
She's bleeding!

1110
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:23,231
It's not me!

1111
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:25,633
He's my bodyguard!

1112
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:39,198
Stay with me!

1113
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:40,839
Come on, Frank.

1114
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,670
God!
Hurry up!

1115
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,272
Come on, Frank!
Stay with me!

1116
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:58,953
How's it going?

1117
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:00,719
It's under control.

1118
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,677
Won't be the same without you.

1119
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:06,548
How you doing?

1120
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:22,157
You shouldn't be here.

1121
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:26,038
You're quitting show business?

1122
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:29,630
Too bad.
You had talent.

1123
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:36,269
Fletcher, go to the plane.

1124
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:41,194
How's the new guy?

1125
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:45,198
He's got white hair.

1126
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:48,355
He's very good.

1127
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:50,272
Did it have to be an old man?

1128
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:53,313
I don't trust you.

1129
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:09,676
Let's get this over with, okay?
Give me a kiss.

1130
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,229
Goodbye, Rachel.

1131
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:20,319
Bye, Frank.

1132
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:31,877
<i>If I should stay</i>

1133
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:40,311
<i>I would only be</i>

1134
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:43,439
<i>In your way</i>

1135
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:47,709
<i>So I'll go</i>

1136
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:49,308
You okay?

1137
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:51,832
<i>But I know</i>

1138
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,512
<i>I'll think of you</i>

1139
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:59,635
<i>Every step of the way</i>

1140
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:08,035
Wait!

1141
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:19,357
<i>And I will always love you</i>

1142
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:26,074
<i>I will always love you</i>

1143
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:37,918
<i>My darling, you</i>

1144
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:44,432
<i>Bittersweet...</i>

1145
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:47,552
<i>...memories</i>

1146
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:51,511
<i>That is all</i>

1147
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:54,228
<i>I'm taking with me</i>

1148
01:57:56,640 --> 01:57:58,278
<i>So goodbye</i>

1149
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:01,796
<i>Please don't cry</i>

1150
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:07,069
<i>We both know</i>
<i>I'm not what you need</i>

1151
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:18,398
<i>And I will always love you</i>

1152
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:24,948
<i>I will always love you</i>

1153
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:33,559
<i>Our speaker this evening</i>
<i>has been a lone courageous voice.</i>

1154
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:38,316
<i>He alone has challenged those</i>
<i>who have linked organized crime...</i>

1155
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:41,438
<i>...with legitimate business</i>
<i>in our state.</i>

1156
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:43,352
<i>Welcome, Congressman.</i>

1157
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:54,633
<i>First our benediction will be delivered</i>
<i>by Reverend Phillip Hardy...</i>

1158
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:58,668
<i>...of the First Presbyterian Church</i>
<i>of Iowa Rapids.</i>

1159
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,631
<i>Heavenly Father...</i>

1160
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:08,509
<i>...please bless us today</i>
<i>as we meet in friendship and duty.</i>

1161
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:12,956
<i>And, Lord, whatever dangerous endeavors</i>
<i>we may take...</i>

1162
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:15,714
<i>...let us never be</i>
<i>without Your sanctuary.</i>

1163
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:18,313
<i>We know in our hearts...</i>

1164
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:21,791
<i>...though we may pass</i>
<i>through the valley of death...</i>

1165
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:23,553
<i>...You are with us...</i>

1166
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:26,314
<i>...guiding and protecting us.</i>

1167
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:28,594
<i>Amen.</i>
