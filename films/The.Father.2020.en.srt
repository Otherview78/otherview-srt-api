1
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,641
Dad? It's me.

2
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,354
Dad?

3
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,281
There you are.

4
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,870
- What are you doing here?
- What do you think?

5
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:50,921
So, what happened?

6
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:52,757
Nothing.

7
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,384
- Oh, tell me.
- I just did. Nothing happened.

8
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:56,969
- Nothing happened?
- No.

9
00:02:57,053 --> 00:02:58,721
I've just had her on the phone.

10
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,598
So? What does that prove?

11
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,475
You can't go on behaving like this.

12
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,894
It's my flat, isn't it?
This is incredible.

13
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:08,689
You burst in on me as if--
I've no idea who she is, this woman.

14
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:10,232
I never asked her for anything.

15
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:13,194
- She's here to help you.
- To help me do what?

16
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,697
I don't need her. I don't need anyone.

17
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,342
She told me
you'd called her a little bitch.

18
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,802
I don't know what else.

19
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:40,471
Maybe. I don't remember.

20
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:45,101
- She was in tears.
- Because I called her a little bitch?

21
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:48,312
No. She told me
that you'd threatened her physically.

22
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:50,231
Me?

23
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:52,066
Physically?

24
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:57,863
She has no idea
what she's talking about.

25
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:00,324
This woman is raving mad. Believe me.

26
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,034
Best if she does leave. Believe me.

27
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:04,161
Especially as...

28
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:05,621
As what?

29
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,544
I didn't wanna tell you this,
but since you must know,

30
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,671
I suspect she was...

31
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,340
- She...
- She was what?

32
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,844
- She was stealing from me.
- Angela?

33
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,637
What are you talking about?

34
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,848
I'm telling you, she stole my watch.

35
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,266
- Your watch?
- Yes. Yes.

36
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:29,437
- Isn't it more likely you just lost it?
- No. I already had my suspicions.

37
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,063
So I set a trap for her.

38
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:36,569
I left my watch somewhere in the open
to see if she'd pinch it or...

39
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,821
Where? Where did you leave it?

40
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,906
I don't know and I don't remember.

41
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,659
All I know is it's nowhere to be found.
I can't find it.

42
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,370
There's your proof.
That girl stole my watch. I know she did.

43
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:50,833
Yeah.

44
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,131
What's the matter?

45
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,137
I don't know what to do.

46
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,598
We have to talk, Dad.

47
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,350
That's what we're doing, isn't it?

48
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:10,436
No, I mean, seriously.

49
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,771
That's the third one you've...

50
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:16,609
I'm telling you,
I don't need her or anyone else.

51
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,903
I can manage very well on my own.

52
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,032
Wasn't easy to find her. This isn't easy.

53
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,994
She looked really good.
Lots of great qualities.

54
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,289
And now she doesn't want
to work here anymore.

55
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,625
You are not listening
to what I'm telling you.

56
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,377
That girl stole my watch.

57
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,048
I'm not going to live with a thief,
do you understand?

58
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,385
Have you looked under the bath?

59
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,722
- What?
- Under the bath by the pipes

60
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,058
- where you hide your valuables.
- How do you know that?

61
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,101
- Tell me the truth.
- I just know.

62
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,521
- Have you been looking in my hiding place?
- No.

63
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,565
Then how do you know
that's where I keep my valuables?

64
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:58,400
I found it by accident.

65
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,862
- You...
- Dad.

66
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:04,198
Dad!

67
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,492
Where are you going?

68
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,663
I haven't touched anything!

69
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:40,663
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

70
00:06:58,544 --> 00:06:59,753
You found it, then?

71
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,380
- What?
- Your watch.

72
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:04,466
Oh, yes.

73
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,511
So you realize
Angela had nothing to do with it?

74
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,975
Only because I hid it,
luckily, just in time.

75
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,185
Otherwise I'd be sitting here,
talking to you

76
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,062
with no means of knowing what time it was.

77
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:20,566
It's five o'clock, if you're interested.

78
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,735
Myself, I am interested.

79
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:25,279
Pardon me for breathing.

80
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,285
- Have you had your pills?
- Yes.

81
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,122
Why do you look at me
as if something's wrong?

82
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,957
Everything is fine, Anne.

83
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,294
World is turning.

84
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,548
You've always been that way. A worrier.

85
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,676
Whereas your sister...

86
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:53,265
Where is she, by the way?
Have you heard from her?

87
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,394
I'm asking you a question.

88
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:07,780
I'm going to have to move, Dad.

89
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,283
I'm going to have to leave London.

90
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,119
Really?

91
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,037
Why?

92
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,748
We talked about this. Do you remember?

93
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:21,627
Is that why you're so keen
on this nurse living with me?

94
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,087
Obviously, it is.

95
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,381
The rats are leaving the ship.

96
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:37,726
I won't be here.

97
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:42,564
I won't be able to come here every day.
You need to understand that.

98
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:43,482
Yeah.

99
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,111
So you're leaving.

100
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,613
When? I mean, why?

101
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,075
I've met someone.

102
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:54,868
You?

103
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:55,869
Yes.

104
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,457
- You mean, a man?
- Yes.

105
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,500
Really?

106
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,545
You don't have to sound so surprised.

107
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,255
No, no, it's just that, I mean...

108
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,299
You have to admit that since...

109
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,178
- James?
- James.

110
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,598
There hasn't been a lot of...

111
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,145
- What does he do anyway?
- He lives in Paris.

112
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,605
So I'm going to go live there.

113
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,023
You in Paris?

114
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,402
You're not gonna do that, are you?

115
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,572
Wake up. They don't even speak English.

116
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,663
So, if I understand correctly,

117
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,249
you're leaving me.

118
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,208
Is that it?

119
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,462
You're abandoning me.

120
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:47,379
Dad.

121
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,678
What's going to become of me?

122
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,976
Obviously, this is very important to me,

123
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,853
otherwise I wouldn't be going.

124
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,106
I... I really love him.

125
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,736
And I can come back and see you often.

126
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,070
At the weekends.

127
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,533
But I can't leave you here
on your own. It's not possible.

128
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:18,702
That's why, if...

129
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:23,916
If you refuse to have a carer,
I'm going to have to...

130
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:24,833
To what?

131
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,002
To what?

132
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,716
You have to understand, Dad.

133
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,551
Anne?

134
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,429
You're going to have to what?

135
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,338
Anne?

136
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:19,967
Anne?

137
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,616
Is there anybody there?

138
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,143
Everything all right?

139
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,644
Who are you?

140
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:15,731
- Sorry?
- Who are you?

141
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:18,942
What are you doing here?

142
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:21,570
What are you doing in my flat?

143
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,950
Anthony, it's me, Paul.

144
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:27,868
Who?

145
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:29,953
What are you doing here?

146
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,373
I live here.

147
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,251
- You?
- Yes.

148
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,087
- You live here?
- Yes.

149
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,631
You live here in my flat?

150
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,676
Oh, that's the best yet.

151
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,345
What is this nonsense?

152
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,600
I'm gonna phone Anne.

153
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:55,937
Your daughter.

154
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,690
Yes, thank you. I know who Anne is.

155
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,234
Do you know Anne?
Are you a friend of hers?

156
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,612
I'm speaking to you!

157
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,531
Do you know Anne?

158
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,159
I'm her husband.

159
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,330
- Her husband?
- Yes.

160
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,166
Since when?

161
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,669
Coming up for ten years.

162
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,882
Ah, yes, yes.

163
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,051
Of course, yes, yes.

164
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,511
Obviously.

165
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,889
Ten years already? But I thought...

166
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,057
Aren't you...

167
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,643
- separated?
- Who?

168
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,521
- Anne and me?
- Yes, you aren't?

169
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:38,855
No.

170
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,315
Are you sure?

171
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,818
Yes, Anthony.

172
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:44,861
But this thing about France,

173
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,322
wasn't she supposed
to be going to Paris to...?

174
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,408
- Wasn't she...?
- Hello, darling. Yes, it's me.

175
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,037
No, it's just your father
isn't feeling very well.

176
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,622
I think he'd like to see you.

177
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,168
Fine. Don't be too long.

178
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,381
She's just doing some shopping.

179
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,423
She'll be...

180
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,218
- up in a minute.
- Oh, good.

181
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:10,262
She told me...

182
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,307
The other day she told me
she was going to go live in Paris.

183
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,600
- She told me.
- Paris?

184
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,353
- Yes.
- What was she going to do in Paris?

185
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,856
She met a Frenchman.

186
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,942
I don't think so, Anthony.

187
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,778
Yes, she did. She told me
the other day. I'm not an idiot.

188
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:31,783
She told me she was moving
to go and live with him. And...

189
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:34,286
I even remember telling her
it was a stupid idea

190
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,413
because they don't even speak English.

191
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,502
- You don't know about this?
- No.

192
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:44,880
What?

193
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,299
- Have I put my foot in it?
- Don't worry.

194
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:51,386
She hasn't mentioned it to me,
but I'm sure she's intending to.

195
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,389
- So you do know about the Frenchman?
- No.

196
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,724
Oops-a-daisy.

197
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,270
Never mind. Chin up!

198
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,649
They all end up leaving sooner or later.

199
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,193
I speak from experience.

200
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,529
Do you want something to drink
while we're waiting?

201
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,323
Glass of water? Fruit juice?

202
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,034
No, it's just, I was...

203
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:16,620
I was gonna say something.

204
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,961
Yeah. It's because of that girl,
that nurse.

205
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,546
- Laura?
- I've forgotten the name.

206
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,424
That girl your wife insists
on handing me over to.

207
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,886
You know about this.
As if I'm unable to manage on my own.

208
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:37,349
She told me, your wife told me
that I needed the help of this...

209
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,601
Even though I can manage
perfectly well on my own.

210
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:43,563
Even if she does have
to go abroad to Paris, your wife.

211
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:52,113
See, I don't understand
why she persists in...

212
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,909
Look at me. Just take a look at me.

213
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,372
- Paul.
- That's right, Paul.

214
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,250
Take a good look at me.
I can still manage on my own.

215
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:05,877
Don't you think?

216
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,047
I mean, I'm not completely...

217
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,051
You agree? Of course you agree.

218
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,178
But... her.

219
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:21,226
I don't know
where this stupid obsession comes from.

220
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,938
She's always been that way,
ever since she was little.

221
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,524
Thing is, she's not very bright.

222
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,443
You know, she's not very...

223
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:35,198
Not very intelligent.
She gets that from her mother.

224
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:38,201
I think she tries to do the best
she can for you, Anthony.

225
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,787
The best she can,
the best she can, yeah.

226
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,331
I never asked her for anything.

227
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,584
I don't know
what she's cooking up against me,

228
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,253
but she's cooking something up.

229
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:51,256
She's cooking something up,
that I do know.

230
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,301
I suspect she wants
to put me in a home for...

231
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,973
Yes, I've seen the signs.

232
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,436
But let me be absolutely clear.

233
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,355
I am not leaving my flat.

234
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,608
I am not leaving my flat!

235
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:16,698
- This isn't your flat, Anthony.
- Sorry?

236
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,617
If you remember, you moved here--

237
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,911
You moved to our place
while you were waiting--

238
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:22,829
For what?

239
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,998
For a new carer.

240
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,168
Because you quarreled
with the last one. With Angela.

241
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,210
Oh, did I?

242
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,921
That's why you're staying
in our place while you wait.

243
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:34,716
- So, James...
- Paul.

244
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:36,468
Right, Paul.

245
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:40,680
So you're telling me this is your place?

246
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,015
Yes.

247
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,352
Now I've heard everything.

248
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,481
- It's me.
- Ah, there she is.

249
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,069
What's happening?

250
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:58,073
Nothing much.
Your father seemed a bit confused.

251
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,366
Is something wrong?

252
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,204
What is this nonsense?

253
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,997
What are you talking about?

254
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,418
Where's Anne?

255
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:12,796
Sorry?

256
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,714
Anne. Where is she?

257
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:17,050
I'm here.

258
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,845
I just went down
to do some shopping. I'm back now.

259
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:26,893
Oh, I see.

260
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:34,401
What did you buy?

261
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,945
Chicken. Does that sound good?
Are you hungry?

262
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:38,530
Yes, why not?

263
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,784
Here, let me have it. I'll fix everything.

264
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:43,701
Thanks.

265
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,110
Paul said you weren't feeling very well.

266
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,363
I'm fine, thank you.

267
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:26,369
You look...

268
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,247
worried.

269
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,667
No, it's just...

270
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,629
Just what?

271
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,468
Hey.

272
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:45,555
Tell me.

273
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,185
I was making a cup of tea in the kitchen.

274
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:55,398
I was alone in the flat,
and suddenly I heard...

275
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,983
a noise.

276
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,153
Then I came in here
and there was your husband.

277
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,070
Who?

278
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,574
- Your husband.
- What husband?

279
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,493
Well, yours, my dear. Not mine.

280
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:07,577
James?

281
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,163
Your husband.

282
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,664
I'm not married, Dad.

283
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,082
I'm sorry?

284
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,337
I got divorced more than five years ago.

285
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,755
You remember.

286
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,134
- Well, then, who's he?
- Well, who?

287
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,224
Are you doing this on purpose?
Him who just left with the chicken.

288
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:32,644
- The chicken?
- You handed over a chicken a minute ago.

289
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,270
What are you on about?

290
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,397
Did you not hand over a chicken
to someone?

291
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,149
- The chicken!
- What chicken?

292
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,151
What are you talking about, Dad?

293
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,706
Well, he was here just now.

294
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:57,043
I think you're mistaken.
There's no one here.

295
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,963
- He's vanished.
- Who?

296
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:02,966
The man with the chicken?

297
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,259
Your husband!

298
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,511
Why are you smiling?

299
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,222
Nothing. I'm sorry. Sorry.

300
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:14,269
All this nonsense is driving me crazy.

301
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,461
What's the matter, Dad?

302
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,466
There's something funny going on.

303
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:49,429
Believe me,
there is something funny going on.

304
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,889
Come, sit down. Come on.

305
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,357
Now, don't worry.

306
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,569
Everything will sort itself out.

307
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:07,655
I don't know.

308
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:09,407
Yes, it will.

309
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,118
Don't worry.

310
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,289
Have you taken your medication?

311
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,083
What's that got to do with anything?

312
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,710
Let's give you your medication.

313
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,003
The evening dose.

314
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,047
Then you'll feel better.

315
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,051
It's been going on for some time.

316
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,387
Strange things going on around us.

317
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:32,930
Haven't you noticed?

318
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,187
There was this man claiming
this was not my flat.

319
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:44,067
A really unsympathetic-looking man.

320
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,985
A bit like your husband, only worse.

321
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:51,616
It's the best yet, don't you think?
In my flat. He told me.

322
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:58,831
But...

323
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:05,004
This is my flat.

324
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:06,589
Isn't it?

325
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,091
Anne?

326
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:11,803
Isn't it?

327
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,306
Tell me, Anne, this really is my flat.

328
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:18,267
Isn't it?

329
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:30,613
Thank you.

330
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:48,381
Yeah.

331
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:50,383
I know.

332
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,010
I know.

333
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:56,514
No. You can't imagine
how difficult it is sometimes.

334
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,516
The other day,
he didn't even recognize me.

335
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,435
I know.

336
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:02,603
Yeah.

337
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:04,355
Thank you.

338
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,693
As long as he likes her,
that's the main thing, isn't it?

339
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,362
And to know that he'll be happy.

340
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,698
Yeah.

341
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,619
No, that's a good idea. Yeah, absolutely.

342
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:19,662
Hope so.

343
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:22,248
She seemed nice on the phone.

344
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,546
Well, I'll let you know how it goes.

345
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,173
Yeah.

346
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,674
Okay.

347
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,218
Right, right.

348
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,263
Okay. Speak soon. Lots of love. Bye.

349
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,700
- Hello.
- Hello. I'm not too early, am I?

350
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:00,119
No, no, not at all. Come in.

351
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:01,370
- Come in.
- Thanks.

352
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,916
So come in.

353
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,709
- Thanks for coming around.
- That's okay.

354
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:11,339
My father's just in his room.
Would you like something to drink?

355
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,966
- No, thanks.
- Okay. Please make yourself comfortable.

356
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:15,468
I...

357
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,762
Yeah, so I was telling you,

358
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:21,098
- my father is upset by the whole idea--
- That's okay.

359
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,810
Yeah, so it can cause him to...

360
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,313
I think he's quite annoyed with me.

361
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:33,069
I'm just telling you this because
he is capable of reacting unexpectedly.

362
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,154
Has he lived on his own up till now?

363
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:38,616
Yes. He was in a flat not far from here.

364
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,909
Which worked.

365
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,453
And I was able to pop in on him
practically every day.

366
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:44,413
But we've had to come
to another arrangement.

367
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:47,041
- It wasn't viable anymore.
- I understand.

368
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:51,254
He's had several carers,
one after another.

369
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,924
He finds it difficult to get on with them.

370
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,092
He has his ways.

371
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,263
That's why I moved him in here with me.

372
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:03,724
But I'm finding it quite difficult
to manage on my own.

373
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:08,479
It's a bit much 'cause I have to work,
and that's why I need someone to help me.

374
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,440
- Did I hear the bell?
- Dad. Yes.

375
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,608
Ding-dong.

376
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,153
- I'd like you to meet Laura.
- How do you do, sir?

377
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:18,573
I explained to you
that Laura was going to come by today

378
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:19,824
so that you two could meet.

379
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,534
- Hello.
- Hello.

380
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,744
- I say, you're gorgeous.
- Thank you.

381
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,121
But I...

382
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:28,916
Haven't we met before?

383
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,585
No, I don't think so.

384
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:34,046
Are you sure? I have a distinct impression
that I've seen you before.

385
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,717
So Laura has come round to meet us

386
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,427
so she can get an idea of how you live

387
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,637
and to what extent
she might be able to help you.

388
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:44,849
I know, dear. I know that.
You've already told me a hundred times.

389
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:46,642
My daughter has...

390
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,687
a tendency to repeat herself.

391
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,772
But you know what it's like,
it's an age thing.

392
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,275
Would you like a drink?

393
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,776
You're very kind, but no, thanks.

394
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,320
An aperitif? Are you sure?

395
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:00,364
A little aperitif.
Time for an aperitif, no, no?

396
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:03,409
Just a moment, I'll be back.

397
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:06,913
He's going to find his watch.

398
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,959
- I must say, he's charming.
- Yeah. Not always.

399
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:26,015
Just as I thought, time for an aperitif!

400
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,601
I have two watches.
I've always had two.

401
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,062
One on my wrist and the other in my head.

402
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,563
It's always been that way.

403
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:36,025
- Now, what would you like, young lady?
- Dad.

404
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,946
I'm allowed to offer our guest a drink,
am I not? What will it be?

405
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,367
- What are you going to have?
- A small whiskey.

406
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,618
I'll have the same.

407
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,413
Splendid. Two small whiskies coming up.

408
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,624
Anne, please.

409
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,836
It's okay, Anne,
I'm not going to offer you a drink.

410
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,547
She never touches alcohol. Not a drop.

411
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,050
- It's true.
- Never. Not a drop, yeah.

412
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,345
That's why she seems so...

413
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:06,055
- So what?
- Sober.

414
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:09,517
Her mother was the same.
The soberest woman I've ever met.

415
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:13,646
Oh, dear.

416
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,231
Silly.

417
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,234
Whereas her little sister was
quite a different story.

418
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,527
You have two daughters?

419
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,696
Even though I hardly ever hear
from the other one.

420
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,031
All the same, she was always my favorite.

421
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,992
She was a painter. Look, there you are.

422
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:28,327
<i>The Pirouette.</i> Beautiful, isn't it?

423
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:29,495
Yes, it is.

424
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:30,830
Yes.

425
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:33,541
A dazzling girl.

426
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,544
I don't understand
why she never gets in touch. Never.

427
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:39,505
Your whiskey.

428
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,674
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

429
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,519
I'd give everything I own for a glass
of whiskey. Don't you agree?

430
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,938
Well, I don't own all that much, so...

431
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:58,190
Really? What do you do for a living?

432
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:02,778
I look after other people.

433
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:03,696
Other people?

434
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:07,533
Yeah, my job is to help people
who need help.

435
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:11,912
Sounds like those girls you're always
trying to dump off on me.

436
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:13,914
Must be a difficult job though, isn't it?

437
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:15,791
Spending all day with one of those...

438
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,752
I couldn't stand it. Am I right?

439
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,714
What about you?
What did you do for a living?

440
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,382
Oh, I was a dancer.

441
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:24,467
- Were you?
- Yes.

442
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,718
- Dad.
- What?

443
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:29,680
- You were an engineer.
- What do you know about it?

444
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,266
Yes, tap dancing was my specialty.

445
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,435
- Really?
- You seem surprised.

446
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,020
- A little bit.
- Why?

447
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,731
Don't you believe me,
or you find that difficult to imagine?

448
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,943
Of course. It's just...
I've always loved tap dancing.

449
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:46,197
You, really?
I'm still great at it. I'll show you.

450
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,287
Jolly good. Why are you laughing?

451
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,706
Sorry. Sorry.

452
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,792
I know who she reminds me of.

453
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:58,876
Who?

454
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,669
It's Lucy. Lucy, when she was younger.

455
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:02,588
- Lucy?
- Yeah, my other daughter.

456
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,007
That's right.
There is a resemblance, don't you think?

457
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:07,384
- Yeah, maybe.
- Yes.

458
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:09,929
Yes.

459
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:12,431
Her unbearable habit of laughing inanely.

460
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,021
I had you there, didn't I?

461
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,779
The situation is very simple.

462
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:28,864
I have lived in this flat...

463
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,200
for some time now.

464
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,619
I'm extremely attached to it.

465
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:38,749
I bought it more than 30 years ago.
Can you imagine? You weren't even born.

466
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,001
Yes, it's a big flat.

467
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:43,003
Very nice. It's very big.

468
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,465
And I've been very happy here.

469
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:52,805
Anyway,
my daughter is very interested in it.

470
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,098
What are you talking about?

471
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:58,811
You see, my daughter is of the opinion
that I cannot manage on my own.

472
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,730
So she's moved in with me,
ostensibly to help me,

473
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:06,777
with this man she met not long ago
just after her divorce.

474
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:07,820
Yeah.

475
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:11,198
Who has a very bad influence on her,
I have to tell you.

476
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:13,200
What are you talking about, Dad?

477
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:18,831
So now she would like to convince me
that I really cannot manage on my own.

478
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:23,252
And the next stage will be
to send me away. I don't know where.

479
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:27,381
It'll be a much more efficient way
of getting hold of my flat.

480
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,843
But it's not going to happen that way.

481
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:36,307
Sorry, dear. I may as well tell you now.

482
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,436
I'm not leaving this flat any time soon.

483
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:43,689
I'm going to outlive you.

484
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:46,275
Both of you.

485
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,693
I don't know about you...

486
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:49,945
but my daughter, yes.

487
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:54,200
In fact, I'm gonna make a point about it.

488
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:57,870
I'm going to inherit from her.
Not the other way around.

489
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:01,582
And the day of her funeral,
I shall give a little speech.

490
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:05,544
To remind everyone how heartless
and manipulative she was.

491
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:07,046
I'm so sorry about this.

492
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:11,091
Why? She understands perfectly.
You're the one who doesn't.

493
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:14,053
See, I've been trying
to convince her for months

494
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:16,096
that I can manage very well on my own.

495
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,975
But... she refuses to listen.

496
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:24,939
I don't need any help from anyone.

497
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,734
And I'm not going to leave my flat.

498
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,946
All I want is for everyone to fuck off.

499
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:34,698
Having said that...

500
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:37,618
it's been a great pleasure.

501
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:39,912
Au revoir. Toodle-oo.

502
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,501
I'm really very sorry about this.

503
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,587
You weren't kidding
when you said he had his ways.

504
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:49,922
I'm really sorry.

505
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:55,636
Don't be.
That sort of reaction's quite normal.

506
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,306
It'll be all right.

507
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,100
Do you think?

508
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:08,190
Yeah.

509
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:02,721
Well?

510
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:04,765
What?

511
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:06,266
Did it go well?

512
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,103
Yeah.

513
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,314
I think so. She said
she was gonna start tomorrow.

514
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:14,149
- Here?
- Yeah.

515
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:15,067
Good.

516
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,986
Yeah. So we'll see
how the first day goes, and...

517
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:23,117
I was worried it wasn't gonna work,
but in the end, it was fine.

518
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,911
- He was charming.
- There you are, you see.

519
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:28,747
Yeah.

520
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:31,500
He really turned the charm on for her.
You should have seen him.

521
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:35,003
He told her he'd been a dancer.
A tap dancer.

522
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,047
- No.
- Yeah.

523
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:42,553
I don't know how to describe it to you.
She's going to be able to...

524
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,473
I think they're really
gonna get on well together.

525
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,644
And then he said
that she reminded him of Lucy.

526
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:52,980
Really?

527
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:56,233
How old is she?

528
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:58,444
Why, you interested?

529
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,290
What's the matter with you?

530
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,086
If it went well,
that's good news, isn't it?

531
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:18,005
Yes. Yeah.

532
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:19,715
So?

533
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:24,344
- What's the matter with you? Tell me.
- It's just...

534
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,221
What?

535
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,975
Just now, when I came back
with the chicken, he didn't recognize me.

536
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,479
It just did something to me.

537
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,524
I understand.

538
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:39,151
Finding it really hard.

539
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:42,237
Come, give me a hug.

540
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,495
I saw it in his eyes.
He didn't know who I was.

541
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:51,288
Like I was a stranger to him.

542
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:55,834
- You'll have to get used to it.
- I can't manage to.

543
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:59,004
I think you can.
I think you're managing really well.

544
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:00,881
Come on.

545
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,221
Oh, Dad.

546
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:11,016
Hi. Dinner will be ready in five minutes.
Does that suit you?

547
00:39:11,642 --> 00:39:13,727
Yes, dear. Suits me fine.

548
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,021
Suits me fine.

549
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:17,648
Hello.

550
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,026
Are you hungry?

551
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,363
Yes, yes. But...

552
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:27,741
We have guests this evening?

553
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:29,409
No, why?

554
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:32,120
Oh, nothing.

555
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:34,456
Nothing.

556
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,770
Everything all right?

557
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,856
You had a good day?

558
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,108
Yeah, very good.

559
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,277
Laura came by.

560
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,487
Didn't she, Dad?
Laura came by just now to see us.

561
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:07,489
- Who?
- Laura.

562
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:09,366
The young woman who came to see us.

563
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:14,580
Then we saw the doctor.

564
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:16,748
Has anyone seen my watch?
I seem to have lost it.

565
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:17,874
Again?

566
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,545
You've probably put it
in your cupboard. In your hiding place.

567
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:22,713
What cupboard?

568
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:26,091
I don't know what you're talking about.
I really don't know, Anne.

569
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:29,845
What cupboard? There's no cupboard.
There's no cupboard, is there?

570
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,639
Can we be more discreet?

571
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:34,141
Have you looked in your cupboard?

572
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:36,893
It's not there.
I must have lost it somewhere.

573
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:38,437
- Or it's been stolen.
- It hasn't.

574
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,730
What do you mean, it hasn't?

575
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:43,108
- It can't have flown away.
- You want me to go and have a look?

576
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,818
Very much so. It is a bother.

577
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,904
I am worried.
It's very worrying. I mean...

578
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:51,366
Losing all my things,
everyone's just helping themselves, and...

579
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:55,621
If this goes on much longer,
I'll be stark naked.

580
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:56,538
And...

581
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,709
I won't be able to tell
what time it is. Please.

582
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:01,793
Thank you.

583
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,081
Might you have the time?

584
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,459
Almost eight.

585
00:41:44,086 --> 00:41:45,045
That's late.

586
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,715
Shouldn't we be sitting down for dinner?

587
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:51,510
Yes, in five minutes,
when the chicken's ready.

588
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:53,679
We're having chicken this evening?

589
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:55,847
It's the one Anne bought.

590
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:11,780
It's pretty.

591
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:13,990
Your watch, it's...

592
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,077
It's very pretty. It's...

593
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,579
Yeah. Is it yours?

594
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:24,000
I mean, is it yours?

595
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:25,585
Yes.

596
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,088
Might I see it?

597
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:31,216
So, apparently, it went very well today.

598
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,884
Oh, yes.

599
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:35,762
Very well. Very well.

600
00:42:37,848 --> 00:42:39,766
Apparently, she looks like Lucy.

601
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,601
Really?

602
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,229
I don't know. I've never seen her.

603
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,356
No, it...

604
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,902
It went well. Anne seemed pleased.
You know, it's...

605
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:54,281
I don't really need--
It's mainly for Anne.

606
00:42:55,866 --> 00:42:57,617
Might I have a look at it?
See your watch?

607
00:42:57,701 --> 00:43:01,788
You're right, you know,
it's important to her this works out.

608
00:43:01,872 --> 00:43:02,873
Yeah.

609
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:05,959
She's been worried about you.

610
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:08,211
And it really upsets her

611
00:43:08,712 --> 00:43:10,797
when you keep falling out with--

612
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,677
- What is it about my watch?
- Nothing.

613
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:18,013
I was just looking.

614
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,473
I want to check it's...

615
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:23,393
Check if it's... It's pretty. Very pretty.

616
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:26,313
Did you buy it?

617
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:27,314
Sorry?

618
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:30,525
Was it a present or did you buy it?

619
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:31,485
I bought it.

620
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,195
Why?

621
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,323
I don't suppose you kept the receipt?

622
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,492
What are you talking about?

623
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:41,495
- Your watch. It's...
- I was talking about Anne.

624
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,122
Anne?

625
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:46,917
Yes, Anne.

626
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:48,877
Yeah.

627
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:17,572
I don't know why we never really
got on well together.

628
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:21,535
Whereas her little sister...

629
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,704
That was another story.

630
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:29,793
Do you know her? She's marvelous.

631
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,670
Marvelous.

632
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,422
I haven't seen her for months.

633
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:39,010
I can't blame her, she's...

634
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,264
travelling around the world, I think.

635
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,266
She's a painter.

636
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:50,605
I'd be so happy
if she came to see me one day.

637
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:57,279
I'd take her in my arms
and we'd be glued to one another.

638
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,949
For hours on end, like we used to be.

639
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:03,535
A long time ago, when she was little.

640
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:09,249
When she still used to call me:

641
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,334
"Little Daddy."

642
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:14,045
"Little Daddy."

643
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:15,547
Now, that's...

644
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:19,885
That's what she used to call me.

645
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:23,013
Nice, isn't it? "Little Daddy."

646
00:45:27,017 --> 00:45:28,560
Can I ask you a question?

647
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:33,398
But I want an honest answer.

648
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:35,775
Nothing fancy.

649
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:38,361
Can you do that for me?

650
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:39,905
Yeah.

651
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:43,700
Well, then...

652
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:53,001
How long do you intend to hang around here
getting on everybody's tits?

653
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:04,763
What is it?

654
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:07,349
What have you done to your hair?

655
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:11,019
- Nothing. Why?
- You're looking good.

656
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,419
- You lost your keys?
- No.

657
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:52,686
Hello. My father has
an appointment with Dr. Sarai.

658
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:56,147
Dad, come here.

659
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,450
Okay, thank you.

660
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:09,494
So it's you who signs there.

661
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,664
I can fill in these.

662
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:15,542
Date of birth?

663
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:19,004
Friday, 31st of December, 1937.

664
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,047
- Friday?
- Yes.

665
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:24,426
You're living with your daughter
at the moment, is that right?

666
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:26,928
Yes. Until she goes to live in Paris.

667
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,556
No, Dad, why do you keep
going on about Paris?

668
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,392
- What?
- I'm staying in London.

669
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:37,272
You keep changing your mind.
How do you expect people to keep up?

670
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,315
Never been any question
of me living in Paris.

671
00:47:39,399 --> 00:47:41,317
- Yes, there was. You told me.
- No, I didn't.

672
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:43,194
I'm sorry. You told me the other day.

673
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,905
Have you forgotten? She's forgotten.

674
00:47:46,448 --> 00:47:49,743
You're suffering from memory loss.
I'd have a word with the doctor.

675
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:52,829
- In any event, I'm not going to Paris.
- That's good.

676
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:55,457
Paris. They don't even
speak English there.

677
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:14,225
I know how worrying these things can be,
and things can change very quickly.

678
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:17,937
So if you need anything at all,
give me a call. Any time.

679
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:20,148
Thank you. Thank you for your help.

680
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:53,765
Dad?

681
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:42,081
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

682
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:43,458
Thank you.

683
00:50:48,004 --> 00:50:49,255
Hello. What's the matter?

684
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:51,299
What?

685
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:55,220
All right. I'll be up in a minute.

686
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,933
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

687
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:00,850
Sorry.

688
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:07,190
What's happening?

689
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:11,277
Nothing much,
but I think he'd like to see you.

690
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:13,446
- Where is he?
- In his room.

691
00:51:14,364 --> 00:51:15,698
- Let me have it.
- Thank you.

692
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:43,476
Here, let me.

693
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:46,229
What have you done?

694
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,291
What's the matter?

695
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:07,750
Nothing.

696
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,299
Okay. I'll get dinner ready.

697
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,384
Anne?

698
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,554
- What?
- Thank you for everything.

699
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:15,360
- We have to find another arrangement.
- Such as?

700
00:53:15,443 --> 00:53:17,278
- Putting him in an institution.
- A home?

701
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:18,988
Yes, a nursing home.

702
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:21,032
It'd be better for him.

703
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:24,869
Why are you saying this now?
Tomorrow we've got this girl starting.

704
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:26,329
You're right.

705
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:29,665
We'll see. Maybe it'll work out
very well with this girl.

706
00:53:29,749 --> 00:53:31,042
You seem to think she's good.

707
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,378
But, believe me, the doctor is right.

708
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:38,132
The moment will come when--
However good she is, he's ill, Anne.

709
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:40,009
He's ill.

710
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,223
Dad, what are you doing
standing out there? Come on.

711
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:49,560
Come on. Come and sit down.

712
00:53:51,104 --> 00:53:52,021
Come on, Dad.

713
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:08,788
Okay.

714
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:22,927
- So it went well today?
- Yeah. Very well. Wouldn't you agree, Dad?

715
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:27,223
- What?
- You made her laugh a lot.

716
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:30,476
- I did?
- Yes, she said you were charming.

717
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,104
That you had your ways,
but that you were charming.

718
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,773
She's coming tomorrow morning
to start working here.

719
00:54:36,524 --> 00:54:40,278
- Would you like some more?
- I would. It's good chicken.

720
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:44,031
Don't you think? Where did you buy it?

721
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:45,324
Downstairs. Why?

722
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:48,286
No reason. It's good chicken.

723
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:50,037
Paul?

724
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:51,622
No, thanks.

725
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:56,961
So she's working full days,
is she? I mean...

726
00:54:57,587 --> 00:54:58,588
Yeah, till six.

727
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,882
- And then?
- What do you mean?

728
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:02,508
- After six?
- I'll be here.

729
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:08,639
You satisfied?

730
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:10,475
With what?

731
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:12,602
You have a daughter
who looks after you properly.

732
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:15,271
Don't you? You're lucky.

733
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:17,773
- You're lucky too.
- Oh, you think so?

734
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:26,616
- What's the matter with her?
- Anne?

735
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:29,327
She's tired.

736
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:31,662
Needs a bit of sun.

737
00:55:32,497 --> 00:55:33,372
Aye.

738
00:55:34,207 --> 00:55:36,918
You need to take care of her, old sport.

739
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:39,253
Why don't you go away somewhere?

740
00:55:41,923 --> 00:55:42,840
Why?

741
00:55:44,717 --> 00:55:46,969
Sometimes I wonder
if you're doing it deliberately.

742
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:49,138
What?

743
00:55:51,224 --> 00:55:52,350
Nothing.

744
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,022
We had...

745
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:01,692
planned on going to Italy.

746
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:05,321
But we had to cancel at the last moment.

747
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:07,031
- Do you know why?
- No.

748
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:09,617
Because of your row with Angela.

749
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:12,662
We weren't able to go
and leave you on your own.

750
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:17,166
We had to cancel our holiday
and bring you here.

751
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:20,127
Now you're gonna stay here.

752
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:23,673
For good, if I understand correctly.

753
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:25,550
He's forgotten.

754
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:28,261
- It's amazing.
- Stop it.

755
00:56:29,262 --> 00:56:31,222
- Stop what?
- You're being a bit...

756
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,391
- A bit what?
- Sarcastic.

757
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:36,102
No, I'm not.

758
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:39,897
I think I'm being very, very patient.
Very patient, believe me.

759
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:44,360
- Did you take the chicken away?
- Sorry, yes. Did you want some more?

760
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,862
- Is it in the kitchen?
- Yeah, I'll fetch you some more.

761
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:48,197
No, I'll get it.

762
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:04,839
- Why do you say things like that?
- What did I say?

763
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:08,426
I completely understand your feelings.

764
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:12,430
- No, you don't understand.
- I do. But what I don't understand is...

765
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:16,225
You do so much for him,

766
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:19,020
and I respect you for that.

767
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:22,523
I mean, you took the decision
to bring him here and...

768
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:25,067
You know, why not? But...

769
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,238
How can I put this?

770
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:32,617
I think you have to come up
with a different solution.

771
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,910
- He's totally lost it.
- Stop talking like that.

772
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:37,705
How do you want me to talk?
I'm telling the truth.

773
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,499
We have to come up
with a different arrangement.

774
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:43,210
- Such as?
- Put him in an institution.

775
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:46,756
- A home?
- Yes, a nursing home.

776
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:51,802
It'll be better for him.

777
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:56,223
Why are you saying this now?
Tomorrow we've got this girl starting.

778
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:57,767
Yes, you're right. We'll see.

779
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,810
Maybe it'll work out
very well with this girl.

780
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:01,145
You seem to think she's good.

781
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:03,856
But, believe me, the doctor's right, Anne.

782
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:08,486
The moment will come when--
However good she is, he's ill, Anne.

783
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:09,612
He's ill.

784
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:15,326
What are you doing standing out there?
Come and sit down.

785
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:18,496
Come on, Dad.

786
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,164
Dad, come in and sit down.

787
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:23,751
Dad.

788
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:59,472
<i>Please hold the line
while we try to connect you.</i>

789
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:02,475
<i>The number you are calling knows
you are waiting.</i>

790
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:14,570
<i>Please hold the line
while we try to connect you.</i>

791
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:17,114
<i>The number you are calling knows
you are waiting.</i>

792
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:27,458
<i>Dr. Sarai speaking.</i>

793
01:00:32,922 --> 01:00:33,839
<i>Hello?</i>

794
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:38,260
<i>Hello?</i>

795
01:01:25,391 --> 01:01:26,225
Dad?

796
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:28,310
Are you up already?

797
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:32,439
Did you sleep well?

798
01:01:37,236 --> 01:01:38,863
Anne, where are these from?

799
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:42,032
Shall I get you some tea
before she arrives?

800
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,586
- Where's the painting?
- What painting?

801
01:01:54,712 --> 01:01:55,588
Lucy's.

802
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:59,925
You're mixing this up with your flat.
There's never been a painting there.

803
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:02,136
Come and have some breakfast.

804
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:06,682
Anne.

805
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,225
Look.

806
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:09,852
See.

807
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:15,691
Anne?

808
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:21,071
Here's your tea.

809
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:25,743
- What?
- Don't let it get cold.

810
01:02:27,912 --> 01:02:29,663
- Where's Anne?
- She went out.

811
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:33,208
- Really? Already?
- Yeah.

812
01:02:35,628 --> 01:02:38,756
She'll be back. At the end of the day.
I'll look for your medication.

813
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:39,882
- No, wait.
- I'll be back.

814
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:41,926
I'm just going to look
for your medication.

815
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,476
Oh, shit.

816
01:02:59,902 --> 01:03:02,821
- What is the time?
- It's time for your medication.

817
01:03:02,905 --> 01:03:05,532
It's best to take them now.
Then it's done. Don't you think?

818
01:03:06,784 --> 01:03:09,912
This little blue one,
that's the one you like.

819
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:13,415
Your little blue pill.
Look, it's a pretty color, isn't it?

820
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:16,543
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

821
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:19,630
Are you a nun?

822
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:21,173
No.

823
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:24,510
Then why are you speaking to me
as if I'm retarded?

824
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:26,804
- Me?
- Yes.

825
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:29,139
- But I'm not.
- "Your little blue pill."

826
01:03:29,223 --> 01:03:30,349
"Your little blue pill."

827
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,852
- Yeah.
- Sorry. I didn't mean...

828
01:03:33,936 --> 01:03:35,604
It's really unpleasant.

829
01:03:35,688 --> 01:03:38,816
You'll see when you get to my age,
which will happen sooner than you think.

830
01:03:39,525 --> 01:03:40,526
I apologize.

831
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:42,653
It won't happen again.

832
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:47,408
Tell me...

833
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,120
have you noticed something?

834
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:52,705
What about?

835
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:56,625
- Well, you know, my flat.
- What about it?

836
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:58,836
Well, it's changed.

837
01:03:58,919 --> 01:03:59,962
You think?

838
01:04:00,963 --> 01:04:01,922
Yes.

839
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:04,633
Those chairs, for instance.

840
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:06,593
There, there.

841
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:10,848
- Who put them there?
- I don't know. Your daughter, I imagine.

842
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:12,933
Obviously my daughter, obviously.

843
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:18,564
All the same, it is extraordinary
not even to ask my opinion.

844
01:04:23,736 --> 01:04:26,447
I wanted to apologize if I was a little...

845
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:29,324
- the last time we met.
- No problem.

846
01:04:29,408 --> 01:04:32,870
Your daughter warned me.
She told me you had your ways.

847
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:37,124
Yeah.

848
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:44,715
It is amazing how much you look like Lucy.

849
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:54,808
Anne told me what happened to her.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

850
01:04:55,476 --> 01:04:58,020
- What?
- About her accident.

851
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:00,355
What accident?

852
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:03,233
What?

853
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:05,736
What are you talking about?

854
01:05:07,863 --> 01:05:08,781
Nothing.

855
01:05:13,285 --> 01:05:15,954
Are you taking your medication?
Then we'll go get dressed.

856
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:17,289
- You see?
- What?

857
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,542
You're speaking to me
as if I were retarded.

858
01:05:20,626 --> 01:05:22,544
- No, I'm not.
- You are!

859
01:05:22,628 --> 01:05:23,545
I'm not.

860
01:05:23,629 --> 01:05:24,797
- Yeah.
- I...

861
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,424
"And we'll get dressed."
"And your little blue pill."

862
01:05:27,508 --> 01:05:30,552
Thing is, I'm very intelligent.
You need to bear that in mind.

863
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:32,429
Do you understand?

864
01:05:33,055 --> 01:05:34,973
Yes, I'll bear that in mind.

865
01:05:36,517 --> 01:05:38,393
Good. Thank you.

866
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:42,606
Yeah, it's true. I'm very intelligent.

867
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:45,859
Sometimes I even surprise myself.

868
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,615
I have a memory like an elephant.

869
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:58,163
- You know that animal?
- Yes, yes.

870
01:06:02,334 --> 01:06:04,419
You've forgotten your pills.

871
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:06,421
What are they doing there?

872
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:10,134
- Shall I get you another glass of water?
- No, don't bother.

873
01:06:10,217 --> 01:06:14,096
I'll swallow them with...
You'll see, that cup of tea.

874
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,598
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, positive. Look here.

875
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:19,977
You'll see. Are you watching?

876
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,563
- Yes.
- Watch carefully. Okay?

877
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:24,523
I put them in my gob.

878
01:06:27,818 --> 01:06:29,736
- Watch carefully.
- Yes, I'm watching.

879
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:30,821
Good.

880
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:32,656
Nice cup of tea.

881
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,658
Hey, presto.

882
01:06:40,581 --> 01:06:41,999
Job is done.

883
01:06:42,082 --> 01:06:43,542
- Bravo.
- Yeah.

884
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:45,711
You know...

885
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:50,757
I worked in a circus a bit
when I was young.

886
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:52,801
- Did you?
- Yes.

887
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:57,681
- Would you like me to show you some magic?
- Why don't we get dressed first?

888
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:58,807
- Now?
- Yes.

889
01:06:58,891 --> 01:06:59,975
- No, not now.
- Yes!

890
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:01,143
- No.
- Yes.

891
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:02,769
Why? What's the point?

892
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:06,273
I'll only have to put
my pajamas back on again.

893
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:09,693
- Might as well save some time.
- I see what you mean.

894
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:13,864
But... if you stay in your pajamas,
we can't go out.

895
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:15,699
Where do you wanna go?

896
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,910
- Park.
- Oh, God.

897
01:07:17,993 --> 01:07:20,329
- It's a nice day.
- Everything all right?

898
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:24,208
- Fine. We're going to get dressed.
- But...

899
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,377
Everything all right, Anthony?

900
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:29,338
Something the matter?

901
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:31,381
No, no.

902
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,552
I just wanted to have
a word with you, in fact.

903
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:37,763
- With me?
- Yes.

904
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,891
- I'll go pack up our things.
- No, don't go.

905
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,101
- I'll be back.
- Don't leave me on my own.

906
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:45,103
I'll be in the next room.
I'll be right back.

907
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:53,195
Can I ask you a question?

908
01:07:58,325 --> 01:07:59,284
Yeah.

909
01:07:59,368 --> 01:08:02,496
But I want an honest answer.
Nothing fancy. Can you do that for me?

910
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:05,832
Yeah.

911
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:07,668
Well, then...

912
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:12,256
How much longer
do you intend to hang around

913
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:15,133
getting on everybody's tits?

914
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:18,971
- Who, me?
- Yes, you. I'd like to know your opinion.

915
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:23,225
I mean, do you intend
to go on ruining your daughter's life?

916
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:25,644
Or is it too much to hope
you might behave reasonably

917
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:27,354
in the foreseeable future?

918
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:30,190
- What are you talking about?
- About you, Anthony.

919
01:08:30,274 --> 01:08:32,651
About you. Your attitude.

920
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:34,820
Stop that. I won't allow this.

921
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:36,655
- Won't allow it?
- No.

922
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:38,907
Suppose I do it again,
then what will you do?

923
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:40,659
- I...
- Yeah?

924
01:08:41,285 --> 01:08:42,995
You'll have to take me on, physically.

925
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:45,289
Are you saying that to tempt me?

926
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:48,292
See, me as well,
there's something I won't allow.

927
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:51,169
Getting on everybody's tits.
Past a certain age.

928
01:08:51,253 --> 01:08:53,964
No, stop that. Stop that.

929
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:57,551
Yeah. I won't put up with that.
I find that totally inappropriate.

930
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,428
Stop it. Stop it.

931
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:08,687
Dad, what's happened?
What's the matter with him?

932
01:09:09,438 --> 01:09:10,564
Dad.

933
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:13,525
It's okay. Is it about your watch?

934
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,611
Is that the reason? I found it, look.

935
01:09:16,695 --> 01:09:18,947
It's okay. Oh, don't cry.

936
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:22,743
Don't cry.
You'll be all right now. It'll be okay.

937
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:24,703
You'll be all right.

938
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:29,666
Let's eat our chicken, shall we?
You like chicken, don't you?

939
01:09:32,002 --> 01:09:33,628
What time is it?

940
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:35,839
It's eight o'clock. Time to eat.

941
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:40,594
Eight o'clock in the evening?

942
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:43,764
I thought it was morning.

943
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:48,101
I've only just got up.
Look, I'm still in my pajamas.

944
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:51,980
No, it's the evening,
and I've cooked you a chicken.

945
01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:53,273
Oh, Dad.

946
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:55,025
It's okay. Come on.

947
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,527
Come on, baby. Come on.

948
01:09:58,278 --> 01:09:59,988
Little Daddy, it's okay.

949
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:07,621
Little Daddy.

950
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:31,163
Dad?

951
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,000
Dad, are you asleep?

952
01:11:36,001 --> 01:11:36,835
Anne?

953
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,254
Anne?

954
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:46,136
Dad, it's me.

955
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:49,973
Lucy?

956
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:17,542
Dad?

957
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:44,277
Dad.

958
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:02,212
Lucy?

959
01:13:29,489 --> 01:13:30,615
Dad.

960
01:14:16,328 --> 01:14:17,162
Dad?

961
01:14:17,871 --> 01:14:18,955
Are you up already?

962
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:23,126
Shall I get you some tea
before she arrives?

963
01:14:39,434 --> 01:14:40,560
Dad.

964
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:42,896
- Good morning.
- Sit down. It's ready.

965
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:44,564
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

966
01:14:45,607 --> 01:14:47,692
You've got a visitor today.
Do you remember?

967
01:14:48,568 --> 01:14:49,527
Do you remember?

968
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,781
How could I forget?
You never stop talking about it.

969
01:14:53,281 --> 01:14:54,616
She shouldn't be long.

970
01:14:55,784 --> 01:14:57,369
- This early?
- Yeah.

971
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:01,498
- I dreamt about her last night.
- Laura?

972
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:03,208
Yes. Well, I think I did.

973
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:04,542
I could see her face.

974
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:06,169
You know, I--

975
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:09,339
She really reminded me of your sister.

976
01:15:11,091 --> 01:15:12,801
Yes, you said that yesterday.

977
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:15,679
Well, if you're happy, I'm happy.

978
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:17,514
She seems really nice.

979
01:15:17,597 --> 01:15:19,224
- Sweet and efficient.
- Yeah.

980
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:21,393
I think she'll look after you well.

981
01:15:22,227 --> 01:15:23,853
- I like her.
- Good.

982
01:15:26,773 --> 01:15:28,983
We should get you dressed
before she arrives.

983
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:32,862
- Who?
- Laura, your new carer, the one you like.

984
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:35,782
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah.

985
01:15:36,533 --> 01:15:37,367
Yes.

986
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,327
We'll get a jacket on you
before she arrives.

987
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:40,370
And trousers.

988
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:42,580
Yes.

989
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,667
She said she really enjoyed
meeting you yesterday.

990
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:48,962
You did quite a little number on her.

991
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,463
- I did?
- Yes.

992
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:52,298
You convinced her
that you knew how to dance

993
01:15:52,382 --> 01:15:54,134
and you were really good at tap dancing.

994
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:56,803
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

995
01:15:58,388 --> 01:15:59,764
And what did she say?

996
01:15:59,848 --> 01:16:02,600
She said she hoped you'd give her
a demonstration one day.

997
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,061
That's funny.

998
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:09,482
I didn't know I knew
how to tap-dance. Did you?

999
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:10,400
No.

1000
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:14,487
- Hidden talents.
- Apparently, yes.

1001
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:19,617
- Is that her?
- I expect so.

1002
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:21,661
But I'm not ready. I'm not even dressed.

1003
01:16:22,162 --> 01:16:25,081
- Never mind. You can get dressed later.
- No, wait. I'm not even--

1004
01:16:25,165 --> 01:16:26,750
- I must get dressed.
- It doesn't matter.

1005
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:28,209
It does matter!

1006
01:16:28,293 --> 01:16:31,421
- She's outside the door.
- Don't leave me alone. Look--

1007
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:33,381
What will she think of me?

1008
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:35,467
I've gotta be properly dressed.

1009
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,427
Why do you have
to make everything difficult?

1010
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:39,512
You can get dressed later.
Don't worry about it.

1011
01:16:39,596 --> 01:16:41,055
- I'll be mortified!
- No, you won't.

1012
01:16:41,139 --> 01:16:41,973
I will.

1013
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:46,561
- Laura, hello.
- Hello. I'm not too early, am I?

1014
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:49,230
No, no, not at all. Come in.
We're just in the kitchen.

1015
01:16:50,023 --> 01:16:52,025
- Here we are. About to get dressed.
- Hi.

1016
01:16:58,072 --> 01:17:00,116
- Anne, who's this?
- Hello, Anthony.

1017
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:04,204
But, Anne, it's not her.

1018
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:05,121
Dad.

1019
01:17:05,789 --> 01:17:08,041
Would you like something to drink,
some coffee or...?

1020
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:09,709
- No, thanks.
- Have you had breakfast?

1021
01:17:09,793 --> 01:17:11,419
- I'm fine.
- I...

1022
01:17:11,503 --> 01:17:14,005
I don't want her. Where's the one I like?

1023
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:16,341
What are you talking about?
Say hello to Laura.

1024
01:17:19,511 --> 01:17:21,596
There's something
doesn't make sense about this.

1025
01:17:22,764 --> 01:17:25,975
- It doesn't make sense.
- Remember me? We met yesterday.

1026
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:29,687
We were just starting
to get to know one another.

1027
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:31,147
I said I'd come back,

1028
01:17:31,231 --> 01:17:33,691
just to see how you do things here

1029
01:17:33,775 --> 01:17:36,236
and see if I can help you.

1030
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:38,321
Do you remember?

1031
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:06,057
Dad? Can I talk to you?

1032
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:14,274
How shall I put this?

1033
01:18:16,985 --> 01:18:21,364
Do you remember the first time
you came to stay with me? It was just--

1034
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:24,951
It was a stopgap because you'd
fallen out with Angela and...

1035
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:29,831
I was wondering if it might be better...

1036
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:34,878
What do you think of this room?
It's nice, isn't it?

1037
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,339
- You can see the park.
- Can you?

1038
01:18:44,554 --> 01:18:45,847
It's very nice.

1039
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:51,060
It's a bit like being in a hotel,
don't you think?

1040
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:52,812
All the residents say so.

1041
01:18:58,151 --> 01:19:01,195
I think you'd be better <i>off</i> here.

1042
01:19:03,281 --> 01:19:04,115
Where?

1043
01:19:05,533 --> 01:19:06,367
Here.

1044
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:10,914
I think it'd be more reassuring
and nicer for you

1045
01:19:10,997 --> 01:19:14,208
if we came to a joint decision
about you living here.

1046
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:16,711
What do you think?

1047
01:19:19,172 --> 01:19:22,342
Well, what about you?
What would you do? Where...?

1048
01:19:23,718 --> 01:19:26,262
Where would you sleep? Which room?

1049
01:19:26,346 --> 01:19:29,515
Well, if you remember,
I'm gonna go and live in Paris.

1050
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:33,895
No, you're not.

1051
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:36,648
I am. Remember?

1052
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:38,775
I told you all about it. Remember?

1053
01:19:39,734 --> 01:19:40,735
But you said...

1054
01:19:41,736 --> 01:19:43,529
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1055
01:19:46,741 --> 01:19:48,034
But you told me...

1056
01:19:49,077 --> 01:19:50,662
you were staying here with me.

1057
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:54,290
No, I have to go. It is important.

1058
01:19:54,374 --> 01:19:56,000
I explained it all to you.

1059
01:19:56,084 --> 01:19:58,670
I'll come back and see you,
occasional weekends.

1060
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:05,218
What about me?

1061
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:10,890
You're going to stay here in London.

1062
01:20:12,183 --> 01:20:13,351
All on my own?

1063
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:18,356
- What about your sister? Where is she?
- Oh, Dad.

1064
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:21,526
If you only knew how much I miss her.

1065
01:20:23,111 --> 01:20:26,322
I do too. I miss her too, Dad.
We all miss her.

1066
01:22:59,058 --> 01:22:59,892
Anne?

1067
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:27,962
Sleep well?

1068
01:23:29,088 --> 01:23:30,506
What am I doing here?

1069
01:23:32,049 --> 01:23:32,925
It's time.

1070
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:36,262
I didn't ask about the time.
I asked you what I was doing here.

1071
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:37,555
Where's Anne?

1072
01:23:38,306 --> 01:23:40,016
I've brought you your medication.

1073
01:23:40,099 --> 01:23:42,935
Why don't you just fuck off
with your medication?

1074
01:23:43,019 --> 01:23:44,729
- Are you a nurse?
- Yeah.

1075
01:23:44,812 --> 01:23:47,607
Oh, you are. Oh, I see. That's it.

1076
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:49,400
You are a nurse.

1077
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:50,359
Yes.

1078
01:23:50,443 --> 01:23:53,529
That's what I was thinking.
You're the type. Typical nurse.

1079
01:23:53,613 --> 01:23:55,448
So, what are you doing here?

1080
01:23:56,073 --> 01:23:58,701
- Sorry?
- What are you doing here?

1081
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:00,119
I'm looking after you.

1082
01:24:01,287 --> 01:24:03,873
You don't say, really? Looking after me?

1083
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:06,167
Well, first I've heard of it.

1084
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:08,961
Since when?

1085
01:24:09,754 --> 01:24:11,005
Quite a few weeks now.

1086
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:12,965
Oh, a few weeks now?

1087
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:15,218
Happy to hear it.

1088
01:24:16,219 --> 01:24:19,305
Amazing. Nobody ever tells me
anything in this house.

1089
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:22,892
- I thought we were getting a new one.
- A new what?

1090
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:25,811
Nurse. A new nurse.

1091
01:24:25,895 --> 01:24:29,190
The one who looks a bit like Lucy,
my other daughter.

1092
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:32,735
I met her the other day.
She came here, didn't she?

1093
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:34,695
Will you take your medication?

1094
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:38,115
She was supposed to start this morning.

1095
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:39,867
Laura. Wasn't she?

1096
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:42,870
I think you're mixing things up, Anthony.

1097
01:24:42,954 --> 01:24:45,456
The one who reminds me of Lucy.

1098
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:47,917
- Right.
- Right.

1099
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:50,586
Time to take our medication.

1100
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:52,505
Yeah.

1101
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,715
Not timed by the minute, is it?

1102
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:02,932
Where is Anne?

1103
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:06,394
Your daughter isn't here, Anthony.

1104
01:25:07,979 --> 01:25:10,898
- Where is she? Has she gone out?
- If you remember,

1105
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:13,067
she lives in Paris.

1106
01:25:14,485 --> 01:25:15,987
No. Oh, no, no, no.

1107
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:20,366
She thought about going...

1108
01:25:21,409 --> 01:25:22,868
but in the end, it didn't happen.

1109
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,747
She's been there several months now.

1110
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:29,667
My daughter, in Paris?

1111
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:32,253
No, no, no. They don't even speak English.

1112
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:33,170
Look.

1113
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:39,093
Yesterday, this postcard she sent you,
we read it together.

1114
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:41,220
Do you remember? Look.

1115
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,350
I tell you this every day.

1116
01:25:46,851 --> 01:25:49,145
She lives in Paris
because she met a man called Paul

1117
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:51,063
and that's who she's living with now.

1118
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:53,983
She comes to see you sometimes.

1119
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:55,818
- Anne?
- Yes.

1120
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:57,903
Occasionally, she comes for the weekend.

1121
01:25:57,987 --> 01:26:00,906
She comes here,
and you go for a walk in the park.

1122
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:05,036
And she tells you about her new life,
what she's up to.

1123
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:09,915
The other day she brought you coffee
'cause you like coffee.

1124
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:11,500
I detest coffee.

1125
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:13,753
I only drink tea.

1126
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:19,467
- Everything all right?
- Fine. We were just getting dressed.

1127
01:26:21,177 --> 01:26:22,094
Everything all right?

1128
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:24,930
Yes.

1129
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:30,686
- There you go.
- Thank you. Have a nice day.

1130
01:26:31,479 --> 01:26:32,480
See you later.

1131
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,278
Him, that one, who is he?

1132
01:26:39,779 --> 01:26:40,613
Who?

1133
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:44,784
Him, who just left.

1134
01:26:45,618 --> 01:26:46,577
That's Bill.

1135
01:26:47,161 --> 01:26:47,995
Bill?

1136
01:26:48,621 --> 01:26:50,289
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

1137
01:26:51,207 --> 01:26:52,249
Yes. Why?

1138
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:53,834
Oh, no reason. I just--

1139
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:57,004
I just, I-- How shall I put this?

1140
01:27:01,384 --> 01:27:02,760
What's he doing here?

1141
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:07,306
Here in my flat? Do I know him?

1142
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,268
He's Bill. You see him every day.

1143
01:27:12,812 --> 01:27:13,646
Do I?

1144
01:27:15,356 --> 01:27:16,732
- And you...
- What?

1145
01:27:18,192 --> 01:27:19,568
Sorry to ask this, but...

1146
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:22,029
I mean, you, who--?

1147
01:27:23,197 --> 01:27:25,449
Who are you exactly?

1148
01:27:25,533 --> 01:27:26,659
I'm Catherine.

1149
01:27:27,535 --> 01:27:28,828
Catherine. That's right.

1150
01:27:30,037 --> 01:27:31,539
Yes, yes, yes.

1151
01:27:32,081 --> 01:27:33,082
Catherine.

1152
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:35,668
- And he's Bill.
- Yes.

1153
01:27:42,383 --> 01:27:43,509
What about me?

1154
01:27:47,847 --> 01:27:48,681
Who...

1155
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:52,393
exactly am I?

1156
01:27:53,853 --> 01:27:54,728
You?

1157
01:27:55,855 --> 01:27:56,814
You're Anthony.

1158
01:27:57,356 --> 01:27:58,399
Anthony?

1159
01:27:59,066 --> 01:27:59,900
Yes.

1160
01:28:01,569 --> 01:28:03,112
Anthony. It's a nice name.

1161
01:28:04,447 --> 01:28:05,823
"Anthony," don't you think?

1162
01:28:08,075 --> 01:28:09,410
It's a very nice name.

1163
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:12,955
My mother gave it to me, I imagine.

1164
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:15,708
- Do you know her?
- Who?

1165
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:17,710
My mother.

1166
01:28:18,544 --> 01:28:19,837
- She...
- No.

1167
01:28:21,464 --> 01:28:22,465
She had-- She--

1168
01:28:25,301 --> 01:28:26,927
She had such big eyes.

1169
01:28:29,138 --> 01:28:30,806
I can see her face now.

1170
01:28:32,766 --> 01:28:34,435
She was-- I hope she'll...

1171
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:37,897
come and see me sometime.

1172
01:28:38,564 --> 01:28:40,065
Do you think? Mommy.

1173
01:28:41,192 --> 01:28:45,362
You were saying she might come
occasionally at the weekend.

1174
01:28:45,446 --> 01:28:46,447
Your daughter.

1175
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,075
No.

1176
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:54,705
My mommy.

1177
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:04,632
I want my mommy.

1178
01:29:04,715 --> 01:29:07,259
I want my mommy. I wanna get out of here.

1179
01:29:11,347 --> 01:29:14,725
Have-- Have someone come and fetch me.

1180
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:16,018
Now...

1181
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:19,230
No, no. I want my mommy.
I want her to come and fetch me.

1182
01:29:19,313 --> 01:29:21,440
I-- I want to go home.

1183
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:23,400
What is it, Anthony?

1184
01:29:27,738 --> 01:29:28,739
What is it?

1185
01:29:32,201 --> 01:29:33,369
I feel as if I'm--

1186
01:29:33,994 --> 01:29:36,247
I feel as if I'm losing all my leaves.

1187
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:37,831
- Your leaves?
- Yeah.

1188
01:29:37,915 --> 01:29:39,250
What do you mean?

1189
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:43,045
The branches and the wind and the rain.

1190
01:29:47,216 --> 01:29:49,677
I don't know what's happening anymore.

1191
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:52,513
Do you know what's happening?

1192
01:29:53,973 --> 01:29:55,975
All this business about the flat.

1193
01:29:56,725 --> 01:30:02,189
I... I have nowhere
to put my head down anymore.

1194
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:10,781
But I know my watch is on my wrist,
that I do know.

1195
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:13,158
For the journey.

1196
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:15,911
If not, I...

1197
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:20,291
Don't know if I'll...

1198
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:23,377
be ready to...

1199
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:25,504
To...

1200
01:30:34,013 --> 01:30:35,097
First...

1201
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:38,726
we'll get dressed, shall we?

1202
01:30:38,809 --> 01:30:39,727
Yes.

1203
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:41,604
We'll get dressed,

1204
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:44,857
and then we'll go for a walk
in the park, shall we?

1205
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:45,816
Yes.

1206
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:47,359
Good.

1207
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:51,947
The trees and all the leaves.

1208
01:30:52,531 --> 01:30:55,659
Then we'll come back here,
and we'll have something to eat.

1209
01:30:55,743 --> 01:30:56,577
Yes.

1210
01:30:57,161 --> 01:30:59,788
And then you can have
your siesta, all right?

1211
01:30:59,872 --> 01:31:00,789
Yes.

1212
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,586
And then if you're feeling on good form,

1213
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:08,172
we can go
for another little walk in the park.

1214
01:31:08,714 --> 01:31:10,424
- Just the two of us.
- Yeah.

1215
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:12,343
Because it's such a lovely day.

1216
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:17,139
It's sunny outside.

1217
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:23,020
And we have to go while it's sunny.

1218
01:31:23,103 --> 01:31:25,606
- We have to take that chance.
- Yeah.

1219
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:28,567
'Cause it never lasts long
when the weather's this good, does it?

1220
01:31:28,651 --> 01:31:29,652
No.

1221
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:33,322
So... let's get dressed.

1222
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:34,490
Is that all right?

1223
01:31:34,573 --> 01:31:35,908
No.

1224
01:31:35,991 --> 01:31:37,618
- Come on now.
- No.

1225
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:39,078
Come on, baby.

1226
01:31:39,745 --> 01:31:42,081
It's all right. Come on.

1227
01:31:43,082 --> 01:31:44,041
