1
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:22,201
<i>Get ready for the feel,
the feel of real. X1.</i>

2
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,115
<i>No pain, no gain.</i>

3
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,434
Pizza, guys.

4
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,570
Whoo-hoo!

5
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,370
Hello, Wade.

6
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,129
Hello, Mrs. Gilmore.

7
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,133
What's the matter?
Life getting you down?

8
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,215
<i>I was born in 2027.</i>

9
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:26,011
<i>After the Corn Syrup Droughts,
after the Bandwidth Riots.</i>

10
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,225
<i>After people stopped trying
to fix problems</i>

11
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,640
<i>and just tried to outlive them.</i>

12
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,569
<i>My parents, they didn't make it
through those times,</i>

13
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,907
<i>so I live here in Columbus, Ohio,
with my Aunt Alice.</i>

14
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:48,075
<i>In 2045, Columbus is
the fastest-growing city on Earth.</i>

15
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,333
<i>It's where Halliday and Morrow
started Gregarious Games.</i>

16
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,502
<i>These days, reality is a bummer.</i>

17
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,467
<i>Everyone is looking for a way to escape,</i>

18
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,881
<i>and that's why Halliday...</i>

19
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,015
<i>That's why he was such a hero to us.</i>

20
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,512
<i>He showed us that we could go somewhere
without going anywhere at all.</i>

21
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,515
<i>You don't need a destination</i>

22
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,817
<i>when you're running
on an omnidirectional treadmill</i>

23
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,273
<i>with quadraphonic,
pressure-sensitive underlay.</i>

24
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,523
<i>James Halliday saw the future.</i>

25
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,237
<i>And then he built it.</i>

26
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,403
<i>He gave us a place to go.</i>

27
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,320
<i>A place called</i>

28
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,281
<i>the OASIS.</i>

29
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,633
<i>This is the OASIS.</i>

30
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,972
<i>It's a place where the limits of reality
are your own imagination.</i>

31
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,533
<i>You can do anything...</i>

32
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,568
<i>...go anywhere.</i>

33
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,696
<i>Like the vacation planet.</i>

34
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,582
<i>Surf a 50-foot monster wave in Hawaii.</i>

35
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,910
<i>You can ski down the pyramids.</i>

36
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,295
<i>You can climb Mount Everest</i>

37
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,922
<i>with Batman.</i>

38
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,136
<i>Check out this place.
It's a casino the size of a planet.</i>

39
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,513
<i>You can lose your money there.</i>

40
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,049
<i>You can get married.
You can get divorced.</i>

41
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,559
<i>You can... You can go in there.</i>

42
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,143
<i>People come to the OASIS
for all the things they can do,</i>

43
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,435
<i>but they stay because of all the things
they can be.</i>

44
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,607
<i>Tall, beautiful, scary, a different sex,</i>

45
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,822
<i>a different species,
live-action, cartoon.</i>

46
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,577
<i>It's all your call.</i>

47
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,787
<i>Yeah, that's me.
Well, that's my avatar.</i>

48
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,747
<i>At least, until I feel like changing it.</i>

49
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,164
<i>Except for eating, sleeping,
and bathroom breaks,</i>

50
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,584
<i>whatever people wanna do,
they do it in the OASIS.</i>

51
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,262
<i>And since everyone is here,
this is where we meet each other.</i>

52
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,592
<i>It's where we make friends.</i>

53
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,927
Locate Aech.

54
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,343
<i>Locating Aech.</i>

55
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,598
<i>Aech located.</i>

56
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,980
<i>Sector 12. Planet Doom.</i>

57
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,776
<i>Planet Doom,
the most dangerous place in the OASIS,</i>

58
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,862
<i>and a pretty great place
to pick up coin.</i>

59
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,571
<i>Figures Aech would be there.</i>

60
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,831
<i>Aech is my best friend in the OASIS.</i>

61
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,201
<i>He's my best friend, period.</i>

62
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,213
<i>Even though I've never actually met him
in the real world.</i>

63
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,297
<i>- What's up, Aech?</i>
- Hey, what up, Z?

64
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,713
<i>Next race is in 20 minutes,
and I can't do the late one.</i>

65
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,426
<i>What the hell are you up to?</i>

66
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,058
Man, gettin' my kills on, bro.

67
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,309
<i>Is that Daito?</i>

68
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,015
Daito and Sho.

69
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,773
<i>This an artifact hunt?</i>

70
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,064
Yup. Gregarious 120.

71
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:10,155
<i>Turn into any giant robot
for two minutes. That's rad.</i>

72
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,115
<i>Artifacts.</i>

73
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,871
<i>Those were key.</i>

74
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,784
<i>Halliday made sure
the OASIS was littered</i>

75
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,499
<i>with enough randomly powerful stuff</i>

76
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,460
<i>that anyone could win
if they had the skills.</i>

77
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,714
<i>Death matches and artifact hunts
are a good way to coin-snatch,</i>

78
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,551
<i>but depending on your level of armor,
they're risky.</i>

79
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,304
<i>You see, everyone starts the same,</i>

80
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,558
<i>but the more coin you make...</i>

81
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,345
- Mom! Mom!
<i>- ...the more you level up.</i>

82
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,935
<i>If you get killed,
your avatar can come back to life...</i>

83
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,015
Go get your dad!

84
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,771
<i>...but you lose all your stuff.</i>

85
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,570
<i>Everything you've ever worked for.</i>

86
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,822
<i>All your money.</i>

87
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,360
<i>Your clothes.</i>

88
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,366
<i>Your weapons.</i>

89
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,616
<i>Since people spend
most of their time in the OASIS...</i>

90
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,704
<i>...losing your shit means...</i>

91
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,836
<i>Well, losing your shit.</i>

92
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,670
Aech, 10 minutes until the race starts.

93
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,679
<i>Okay, Mom, I heard you.</i>

94
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:17,014
<i>You see, the OASIS was
the brainchild of James Halliday.</i>

95
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:21,932
<i>He and his partner, Ogden Morrow,
released the first OASIS build in 2025.</i>

96
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,193
<i>It was an instant success,
and it made them both very rich.</i>

97
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,822
<i>But Morrow was out of the picture
after a few years. And Halliday?</i>

98
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,155
<i>He wasn'tjust the owner of
the world's biggest company.</i>

99
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:37,117
<i>He was like a god. People loved him.</i>

100
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,282
<i>They worshiped him
as much as his creation.</i>

101
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,122
Maybe we should stop talking about it

102
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,628
and start, uh, showing it.

103
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,915
If you all wanna reach under your seats,

104
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,254
you'll find that there's nothing there.

105
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,761
But we're each gonna bring you one now.

106
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,554
<i>And then, on January 7, 2040...</i>

107
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,595
<i>He died.</i>

108
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,812
<i>And what he left behind</i>

109
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,775
<i>changed everything.</i>

110
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,375
Hello. I am James Halliday.

111
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,461
If you're watching this, I'm dead.

112
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:36,007
<i>Before I died, I created
what we in the biz call an "Easter egg."</i>

113
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:44,064
<i>A hidden object in a game that gives
special powers to whoever discovers it.</i>

114
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,980
<i>The first person to find the egg</i>

115
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,396
<i>I've hidden somewhere inside the OASIS</i>

116
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:55,237
<i>will inherit my stock
in Gregarious Games,</i>

117
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,199
<i>currently valued in excess
of half a million...</i>

118
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,123
<i>Uh, half a trillion dollars' worth,</i>

119
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:07,663
<i>and total control of the OASIS itself.</i>

120
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:13,969
In the form of my avatar,
Anorak the All-Knowing,

121
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,134
I created three keys.

122
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,350
Three hidden challenges
test for worthy traits

123
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,684
revealing three hidden keys
to three magic gates.

124
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:29,851
And those with the skill
to survive these straits

125
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:34,648
will reach the end,
where the prize awaits.

126
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,316
Off you go, keys.

127
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:44,498
The keys aren't just laying around
under a rock somewhere.

128
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,250
I suppose you could say
they're invisible,

129
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,959
hidden in a dark room
that's at the center of a maze

130
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,045
that's located somewhere

131
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,090
up here.

132
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:01,512
Let the hunt for Halliday's Easter egg

133
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,221
begin.

134
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,976
<i>The challenge
is to find three keys,</i>

135
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,612
<i>but in five years,
no one has even gotten one key.</i>

136
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,069
<i>And the big scoreboard? Still empty.</i>

137
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,526
<i>Some long-forgotten gunter
cracked the first clue</i>

138
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,365
<i>and found the first challenge.</i>

139
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,537
<i>Then, this portal appeared.</i>

140
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,534
<i>But the challenge to win the first key
was a race designed by Halliday</i>

141
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,545
<i>that was so hard,
no one had ever finished it.</i>

142
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:35,048
<i>The only ones still trying
are the gunters, as in "egg hunters,"</i>

143
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,086
<i>like me and Sho and Daito,
and my best friend, Aech.</i>

144
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,048
<i>Oh, and of course, the Sixers.</i>

145
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,681
<i>The Sixers work for IOI...</i>

146
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,758
Sixers!

147
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,185
<i>...Innovative Online Industries.</i>

148
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,391
<i>They're the second-largest company
in the world</i>

149
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,352
<i>with designs on becoming the first.</i>

150
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,604
<i>Which is why they're putting
everything they got</i>

151
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,938
<i>into winning Halliday's contest.</i>

152
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,728
Buckle up!

153
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,439
Sit in!

154
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,324
<i>We call 'em "Sixers"
'cause that's the company rule.</i>

155
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,951
<i>No name, just numbers.</i>

156
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,410
<i>They have a support team
made up of Halliday scholars.</i>

157
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,122
<i>Like me, they spend all their time
studying pop culture</i>

158
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,661
<i>that Halliday was obsessed with,</i>

159
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,875
<i>trying to find clues
to solve the contest.</i>

160
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,339
<i>They're just following
the orders of the head of IOI,</i>

161
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,550
<i>this dickweed named Nolan Sorrento.</i>

162
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,846
How'd you get here before me?

163
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,515
Well, I didn't make a pit stop
at the hair salon.

164
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,479
- What up, Z?
- What's up, Aech?

165
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,311
Saved you a spot.

166
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,603
Thanks, bro.

167
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,071
I gotta go to the back.

168
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,078
Ugh. So you can skim coins
from crashed cars?

169
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,864
- That's just sad, man.
- Fuel's low.

170
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,456
Oh, but you still had enough to pay for
that <i>Something About Mary</i> hairdo.

171
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,077
First to the key.

172
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,454
First to the egg!

173
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,881
Aech, are you seeing this?

174
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,977
Yeah, I see it.
That's Kaneda's bike from <i>Akira.</i>

175
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,184
It's a licensed skin
over a standard frame.

176
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,565
<i>No, not the bike. Forget the bike.</i>

177
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,897
<i>The girl, I think it's Art3mis.</i>

178
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,107
The Art3mis? The Sixer Fixer?

179
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,152
I've seen all her walk-throughs,
her Twitch streams.

180
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,192
It's her. It's definitely her.

181
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,434
Go, go, go! Get there! Come on!

182
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,312
<i>You got it, you got it!</i>

183
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,194
Balls.

184
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:01,908
She's not gonna make it.

185
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,376
Bail! Bail out!

186
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:07,539
Bail!

187
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,380
Ow!

188
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,337
Damn, I loved that bike.

189
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,748
Oh, Aech could...

190
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,383
Well, he's my friend,
but he could fix it for you.

191
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,472
This is my workshop. Touch nothing.

192
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,067
Where did you find an Iron Giant?

193
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,901
Find it? I'm building it.
That's a commission.

194
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,903
Oh, yeah. Aech is top-rated
on the mod boards.

195
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,740
People all over the OASIS
pay him serious coin.

196
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,121
Oh, hey, check this out!

197
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,747
Hey. Z, yo.

198
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,580
- The <i>Galactica,</i> of course.
- These are my babies, all right, man?

199
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,370
<i>Sulaco,</i> from <i>Aliens.</i>

200
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,914
Dude, how are you showing off my shit?

201
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,549
<i>Valley Forge,</i> from <i>Silent Running.</i>
Oh, where's the Harkonnen Drop-Ship?

202
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,085
That thing is sick.
Folds space like a boss.

203
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,004
I mean, you can get from Incipio
to Arrakis in three seconds...

204
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,930
Fingers!

205
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,261
You'll have to excuse him.

206
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,596
He gets a little nervous
around pretty girls.

207
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,235
I can fix it in 10 minutes.

208
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,072
Yup. He's pretty great.

209
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,110
I assume you and Shoulder Blades
are clanned up.

210
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,404
Oh, Aech? Nah.

211
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:05,700
I mean, he's really good,
but I don't clan.

212
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,082
Oh, 'cause you're Parzival,

213
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,622
as in the knight
who found the Holy Grail by himself.

214
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,381
What about you, Art3mis?

215
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:16,760
Goddess of the hunt.
Clans must be killing to sign you up.

216
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,176
- Favorite shooter?
- Excuse me?

217
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,136
James Halliday's
favorite first-person shooter.

218
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,721
- What?
- Oh<i>. GoldenEye.</i>

219
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,102
- Playing as?
- Oddjob. Is this a test?

220
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,262
Favorite game variant?

221
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,938
Game variant was "slappers only."
No weapons.

222
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,100
I know what "slappers only" means.
Racer?

223
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,394
<i>Turbo.</i> And his favorite food
was Hot Pockets.

224
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,153
Favorite restaurant was Chuck E Cheese.

225
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,690
Song was <i>Video Killed the Radio Star</i>
by the Buggles.

226
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,483
Video was <i>Take on Me</i> by A-ha.

227
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,699
Oh, oh...
His favorite quote was from <i>Superman.</i>

228
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,659
"Some people can read <i>War and Peace</i>

229
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,041
"and come away thinking
it's a simple adventure story..."

230
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,827
"Others can read the ingredients
on the back of a chewing-gum wrapper

231
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,372
"and unlock
the secrets of the universe."

232
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,083
Lex Luthor.

233
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,001
Cool.

234
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,049
What would you do? If you won.
The whole contest, I mean.

235
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,055
Oh! I mean, I've got tons of plans
in the real world.

236
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:10,973
I'd move into a huge mansion,
buy a bunch of cool shit, not be poor.

237
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,601
Now I know why you stopped short.

238
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,939
I stopped because of Kong.
No one ever makes it past Kong.

239
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,903
That's, like, a rule.

240
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,536
Well, then you know it can't be true.
Because Halliday hated making rules.

241
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,991
I can't afford to zero out.

242
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,531
- You're afraid to lose your shit.
- No, I'm not!

243
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,665
What happens
when IOI offers you guaranteed coin

244
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,996
for the keys to the kingdom?

245
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,378
Nolan Sorrento takes over the world.

246
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:37,712
A real gunter would risk everything
to save the OASIS from IOI.

247
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,217
Who said that?

248
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,798
Me.

249
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,593
There you go. Good as new.

250
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,426
Thanks for the fix-up, my man.

251
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,732
That's better.

252
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:03,241
I'll wave to you
from the finish line, McFly.

253
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:07,745
That went well.

254
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,622
Thanks to you, Captain Big Mouth.

255
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:13,126
<i>Wade? Wade?
Where the hell are my gloves?</i>

256
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,252
Shit. I gotta go.

257
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,416
<i>X1.</i>

258
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,049
When I'm after gold on Planet Doom,
I need every edge I can get.

259
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:27,091
Every push, punch, gunshot,
you feel it all.

260
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:31,433
<i>Get ready for the feel,
the feel of real. X1.</i>

261
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,847
<i>The X1 is like wearing a second skin.</i>

262
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,898
<i>A skin that kicks ass.</i>

263
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,396
I zeroed out 'cause
of your broke-ass gloves.

264
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,814
Who told you to use them?

265
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,074
You took hers.

266
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,493
So you lost a death match.

267
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,906
Why don't you just respawn
and level up like everyone else?

268
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,199
You don't get it.

269
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,289
I bought all these power-ups
for this challenge, and I lost it all.

270
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,170
That artifact
was gonna pay for the house!

271
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,329
Wait.

272
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,921
How much of our house money
did you spend on upgrades?

273
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,755
Well, all of it, but I was gonna win.

274
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,758
That was our ticket out of here.

275
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,476
You idiot.

276
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,763
No, but I only lost 'cause
of the bad gloves.

277
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,522
Our house! Our goddamn house!

278
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,853
My boys were in that challenge.

279
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,064
You couldn't have beat them
in a bootsuit, you noob.

280
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,689
Stop! No! No!

281
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:24,982
Alice, call the police!

282
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,650
No, we are not calling the cops.

283
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,534
Go to your room, Rick.

284
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,036
Come on, Alice.

285
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,374
Why do you put up with this guy?
He's a shitshow.

286
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:39,459
I ought to kick the both of you out.
I swear to G-O-D, Wade Watts,

287
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,215
if I catch you touching my stuff again,

288
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,922
not joking... Out.

289
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,014
<i>"Wade Watts."</i>

290
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,178
<i>My dad picked that name</i>

291
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,598
<i>because it sounded
like a superhero's alter ego,</i>

292
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,809
<i>like Peter Parker or Bruce Banner.</i>

293
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,774
<i>But he died when I was a kid.</i>

294
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,986
<i>My mom, too, and I ended up here,</i>

295
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,866
<i>living with Aunt Alice</i>

296
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,403
<i>and her endless string
of hard-loving losers.</i>

297
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,999
<i>"Halliday hated making rules."</i>

298
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,752
<i>Why is that line sticking in my head?</i>

299
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,045
<i>Maybe it's 'cause Art3mis said it,
and she's hot.</i>

300
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,761
<i>Maybe it's because she called me out,</i>

301
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,217
<i>sitting here
in my tiny corner of nowhere,</i>

302
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,683
<i>protecting my small slice of nothing.</i>

303
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,936
<i>Or maybe...</i>

304
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,438
<i>Maybe it's because
that line means something</i>

305
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,098
<i>and I missed it.</i>

306
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:46,071
<i>The day the contest was announced,
the Halliday Journals appeared.</i>

307
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,029
<i>He told us to look in his brain.
This was the next best thing.</i>

308
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,536
<i>At first, it was jammed
with gunters looking for answers.</i>

309
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,164
<i>Now, the once-crowded halls
of Halliday's memories</i>

310
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,414
<i>are left to people like me.</i>

311
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,202
Parzival. Oh, joy!

312
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,463
And how will you eat up
my valuable search time today?

313
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,749
Gregarious Games, 2029... Office party.

314
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,044
Office party. Yes, you've only seen it
a thousand times.

315
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,133
Why not go back?

316
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:15,513
Each entry into Halliday's Journals
is meticulously assembled

317
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,019
from personal photographs,
home video recordings,

318
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,929
surveillance, and nanny cams.

319
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:23,771
All rendered into a
three-dimensional virtual experience.

320
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,483
Also, Halliday archived every film,
game, book, and television program

321
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:30,528
he ever saw, located on the mezzanine.

322
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:34,365
No weapons or mature-themed avatars
are permitted within the Journals.

323
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,827
Please enjoy your time with us,
and happy gunting!

324
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,996
I like cleaning up.

325
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,536
Okay, Jim, I'm going.

326
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,922
Everything changes, Jim.
Everything evolves.

327
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,680
Some things are perfect
just the way they are<i>. Asteroids.</i>

328
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,843
People don't live inside
an <i>Asteroids</i> arcade cabinet.

329
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,436
I know that.

330
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,144
Yeah, well, people are living inside
the arcade we built.

331
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,183
- I built.
- Uh, well...

332
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,024
Right. Well, I guess you can say
whatever you want.

333
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,233
I don't really wanna
talk about it anymore.

334
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,738
No, of course
you don't wanna talk about it.

335
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:11,898
You're forcing me out.

336
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:13,362
Closer on Halliday.

337
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,573
Look, invention
comes with responsibilities

338
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,237
you didn't ask for.

339
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,952
All right, if you make something
people want or need

340
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,742
then it's up to you to set the limits.
You have to make some rules.

341
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,206
"I don't wanna make any more rules."

342
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,246
I don't wanna make any more rules.

343
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,376
"I'm a dreamer."

344
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,790
I'm a dreamer.

345
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,880
- I build worlds.
- "I build worlds."

346
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,629
We created something beautiful, Jim,
but it's changed.

347
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,264
Okay? It's really not a game anymore.

348
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,765
Are we finished?

349
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,521
I liked how things were
when they were...

350
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,105
When it was a game.

351
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,814
And we're back to where we started.
But that's the point, isn't it?

352
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,196
Things move forward
whether you like it or not.

353
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,527
Yeah, we're finished.

354
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,233
Fine.

355
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:01,240
Why can't we go backwards,
for once?

356
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:07,291
Backwards, really fast.
Fast as we can.

357
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,752
Really put the pedal to the metal,
you know?

358
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,133
Go back 10 seconds!

359
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:16,380
Why can't we go backwards, for once?

360
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:21,180
Backwards, really fast.
Fast as we can.

361
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,395
Really put the pedal to the metal,
you know?

362
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,939
Bill and Ted did it.

363
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,581
Back again so soon?

364
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,334
Careful not to lose your shit.

365
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,139
You figured something out.

366
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,971
Parzival, tell me.

367
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,034
Nice racing, Padawan.
You're the first to finish.

368
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:52,419
Mr. Halliday... Anorak.

369
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,080
It's such an honor.

370
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,624
The honor is all mine.

371
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,511
Get yourself a clue.

372
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,537
Who is this Parzival,
and how the hell is he winning?

373
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,165
Well, here's a better question.
Who cares?

374
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,167
Halliday's contest is vitally important.

375
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,375
I mean, it's nothing less than a war
for control of the future.

376
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,586
But this Parzival?
He's not even clanned up.

377
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,924
He's alone. We have an army.

378
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,678
And yet,
he's got the first key.

379
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,259
Yeah, he has a key,

380
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,551
but you have to get three of 'em
to win the contest.

381
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,220
Our stock dove 6% yesterday.

382
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:56,186
Loyalty division is reporting
profits of 28%. F'Nale.

383
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,023
We're opening
five new loyalty centers this month.

384
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,062
Debt Services dwarfs Hardware.

385
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,106
Now, you really wanna talk to me
about stock prices?

386
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,399
The shareholders won't be happy.

387
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,819
It's not our job to make them happy.
It's our job to make them money,

388
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:12,036
but once we launch this little baby,
they're gonna flip.

389
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:16,415
We call this Pure O2.

390
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,250
This is the first
of our planned upgrades.

391
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,915
Once we can roll back
some of Halliday's ad restrictions,

392
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:24,962
we estimate we can sell up to 80%

393
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:30,384
of an individual's visual field before
inducing seizures, so picture this...

394
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,553
All of this implies we win the contest.

395
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,608
Indeed, it does.

396
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,147
Dude, you won the key and 100,000 coins?

397
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,318
As soon as I took the key,

398
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:45,774
all the coins
just appeared in my account.

399
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,944
I'll tell you what,
I'm soiling my haptics right now.

400
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,240
What the hell's a Cataclyst?

401
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:58,002
A bomb. Kills every avatar on a planet,
even the owner.

402
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,161
Who'd want that?

403
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,422
IOI. They buy everything.

404
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,418
Twenty-thou for the holy hand grenade?

405
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,257
That's a steal!

406
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,263
Whoa! Zemeckis Cube!
I need one of those.

407
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,099
Okay, don't spend all your money.

408
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,062
X1 haptic bootsuit.

409
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,120
Oh, yeah!

410
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,298
i-R0k, old friend. How are you?

411
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,051
To be honest,
I have kind of a neck thing.

412
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,016
It's like a carpel-tunnel deal

413
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,896
but with your neck,
if that's even a thing.

414
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,524
So if you could just stand
to your right.

415
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,900
My right, your left.

416
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:50,111
Thanks, it's the repetitive stress.
Oh.

417
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,324
Here he is.

418
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:58,789
The steampunk pirate king.
I knew him well, Sorrento.

419
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,667
There are only three things
in this world I hate,

420
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:05,626
steampunk, pirates, and tabbouleh.

421
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,462
I mean, why do they even have it?

422
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,627
Is there a reason we're meeting here?

423
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:15,886
Yes, Nolan. The Orb of Osuvox.

424
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,890
You wanted it. He had it.
And so here it is.

425
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:27,522
It creates an impenetrable magic shield
that can only be taken down

426
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,904
by a magic spell.

427
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,315
The Orb of Osuvox.

428
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,733
Don't say that again.

429
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,946
Okay.

430
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:40,703
Now, I'm gonna need you
to keep this for now.

431
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,708
I'm gonna let you know
when I wanna use it.

432
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,118
Okay?

433
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:51,506
Right now, though,
I have another job for you.

434
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,877
Ah.

435
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,178
Parzival.

436
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,803
Let me guess,
you want him off the scoreboard.

437
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,017
Can you do that?

438
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,554
Well, he's a superstar.

439
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,222
He made it through the first gate

440
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,016
and avatars are gonna be on him
like hoes on Santa.

441
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,607
i-R0k, how much more do you want?

442
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,485
That's what I like about you, Nolan.
You never lick.

443
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,941
You bite straight
to the chocolaty center

444
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,860
of the Tootsie Pop.

445
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,488
Remember that old commercial,
with the owl?

446
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,655
i-R0k.

447
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,034
Three times my normal fee.

448
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,919
Done.

449
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,795
Wait, really?
I should have asked for five.

450
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,877
Is four still on the table?

451
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,591
<i>There's five of us
on the big board now.</i>

452
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,798
<i>Art3mis was next, no surprise there.</i>

453
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,718
<i>She was on the track when I won.
She saw me going backwards.</i>

454
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:46,682
<i>I gave Aech a tip, made him promise not
to say anything, and then he won next.</i>

455
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,851
<i>I'm pretty sure
he bragged to our pal Daito,</i>

456
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,020
<i>'cause he won right after.</i>

457
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,198
<i>And of course,
Daito told his best friend, Sho...</i>

458
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,325
<i>He totally totaled his car,</i>

459
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,578
<i>but then Sho got it, too.</i>

460
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,338
"A creator who hates his own creation.

461
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:15,968
"A hidden key, a leap not taken.
Retrace your steps, escape your past."

462
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,926
"A creator who hates his own creation.

463
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:23,389
"A hidden key, a leap not taken.
Retrace your steps, escape your past.

464
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,929
"And the key of jade
will be yours at last."

465
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,768
"Escape your past."

466
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,399
What part of your past
are you trying to escape, Halliday?

467
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,909
- Hey, it's Parzival!
- Dude!

468
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,870
You're, like, totally my hero!

469
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,038
Hey, Parzival! Over here!

470
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,456
Dude, you're amazing!

471
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,335
Hey, Parzival! Right here!
Let me get an autograph!

472
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,470
Watch it!

473
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:50,230
You're famous now!
You can't just go wherever you want!

474
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,514
No, no, no, I...

475
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,529
Huh?

476
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,410
Ahh!

477
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:14,583
That is... That is not funny.

478
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:17,169
Oh, God.

479
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,166
Ugh.

480
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,295
Oh, God. Don't you get it?

481
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,180
You're "the Parzival" now.

482
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,761
You have to have a disguise.

483
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,686
Okay, here.

484
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,188
Clark Kent glasses.

485
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,896
They hide your identity
without changing your look.

486
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,160
I'm not wearing that.

487
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,125
This is great.

488
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,253
The way your inventory
bursts out when you die.

489
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,838
They didn't want
any more blood.

490
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,673
This is right before
the OASIS went live.

491
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:07,261
Six days prior. December 2nd, 2025.

492
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,300
Check this out.

493
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,059
You know who that is?

494
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,188
Is that Sorrento?

495
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,269
Sorrento started as an intern.

496
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,730
He claims he learned
at the feet of the master.

497
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,441
That's how he convinced IOI
to create the Sixers for him,

498
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,775
his Halliday knowledge.

499
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,316
But ask Ogden Morrow?

500
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,487
He says the only thing Sorrento
actually knew about Halliday

501
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,030
was how he liked his coffee.

502
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,665
You could have, like,
different tiers of accounts,

503
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,292
like a gold member.

504
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:38,955
A person could be
silver, platinum, bronze.

505
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:40,873
You know, depending on what they pay.

506
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,918
Highest one maybe being "Water"
because "OASIS," right?

507
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,631
Hell of a latte.

508
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,922
Can you fast-forward to the stuff
about Halliday's date?

509
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,840
What? Halliday actually went on a date?

510
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,266
So, what happened?

511
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,932
Nothing. I invited her over.

512
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,980
Well, did you at least get her name?

513
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,110
Yeah. Kira, I told you,
like the character in <i>The Dark Crystal.</i>

514
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,024
That's her gamer tag.

515
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,152
- Karen.
- Karen.

516
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,242
Yeah, okay? Karen Underwood.

517
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:16,124
No, no. Karen Underwood,
as in Ogden Morrow's wife?

518
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,535
Just watch.

519
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,755
So, listen, you and Karen Underwood.
What'd you do?

520
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,337
She wanted to go dancing,

521
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,798
so we watched a movie.

522
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,258
And?

523
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,929
Where's the juice?

524
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,219
Give me some juice!

525
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,021
- There is no juice!
- Oh, God!

526
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,182
Hold the phone.

527
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,070
Halliday went on a date
with Ogden Morrow's wife?

528
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,732
Just once, years before
they were even married, but yeah.

529
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,117
And despite that,
and the fact that she died,

530
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,404
the name "Kira" is only mentioned once
in all of Halliday's Journals.

531
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,742
That's not possible.

532
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,623
It is. Look it up.

533
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,080
What we just saw is the only time
she's ever mentioned.

534
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,370
It makes no sense.

535
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,959
She was an important part
of both their lives.

536
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,998
I'll bet you anything. All my coin.

537
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,503
Search "Karen Underwood Morrow."

538
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,758
<i>Kira, I told you,
like the character in</i> The Dark Crystal.

539
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,301
<i>That's her gamer tag.</i>

540
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,687
Halliday purposely removed every
mention of her except for this one.

541
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,314
That's weird. Why?

542
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,315
It's like,
it was just so painful for him

543
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,444
to have to see her face
or hear her name.

544
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,320
Well, he loved her.

545
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,856
He couldn't tell that to Morrow.

546
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,865
Oh, that's sad.
He should have told her how he felt.

547
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,116
Yeah, well, he missed his chance.

548
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,527
Look.

549
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,702
I found the clue to
the race in the other scene, but...

550
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,287
I've always felt
that the biggest clue

551
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,917
to the contest was hidden here.

552
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,044
You're right.

553
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,755
I lose.

554
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,416
Don't sweat it, Curator.

555
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,302
You see, Kira is the Rosebud
at the center of his story.

556
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,507
She's the big mystery.

557
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,968
No, no. A bet is a bet.

558
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,428
Oh, wow. A quarter. You can keep it.

559
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,688
No. You can keep it.

560
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,355
- You free Thursday?
- Who, me?

561
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,862
No, him.

562
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,903
Oh, my God. Yes, you!

563
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,827
You know The Distracted Globe?

564
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,034
Yeah, the dance club.

565
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:22,706
Meet me there. 10:00 p.m.

566
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,087
There's something I wanna show you.

567
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,415
Uh, bye-bye!

568
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,167
Did she just ask me out?

569
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,052
And I was starting to like her.

570
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,883
All right.

571
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,548
I don't do that.

572
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,099
Z, I can't believe
you told her about Kira.

573
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,639
What? I told you.

574
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,103
Hey, what about this?

575
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,445
No. Have you considered
that Art3mis could be using you?

576
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:54,529
Hey, dude, she's giving me a clue.
Maybe I'm the one using her.

577
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:58,367
Should I go more <i>Thriller?</i>

578
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,031
No.

579
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,823
Punk?

580
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,950
No.

581
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,162
Duran Duran.

582
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,412
No.

583
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,247
Does it look like I'm trying too hard?

584
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,509
Yes! Listen to yourself!

585
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,672
You have a massive cyber crush
on this girl.

586
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,340
She's hacking your heart
to get to your head.

587
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,723
I got it!

588
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,805
<i>- Buckaroo Banzai?</i>
- Yeah!

589
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:28,067
Really? You're gonna wear the outfit
from your favorite movie?

590
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,443
Don't be that guy.

591
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,648
I am that guy.

592
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,235
Z, you gotta be more careful about
who you meet in the OASIS.

593
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,526
Aech, Art3mis gets me.
She'll get my outfit.

594
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:39,537
There's just this connection.
I mean, sometimes, we even...

595
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,242
- Finish each other's sentences?
- Yeah!

596
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,159
We have that. Me and you.

597
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,703
Yeah, I know, but that's because
we're best friends, dude.

598
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,667
She could be a dude, too, dude.

599
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:50,831
Come on.

600
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,545
I'm serious!

601
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,336
She could actually be a 300-pound dude

602
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,880
who lives in his mama's basement
in suburban Detroit.

603
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,515
And her name is Chuck.

604
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,060
Think about that.

605
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,168
Whoa, dude, is that Parzival?

606
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,002
- Parzival!
- Oh, my God, Parzival!

607
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,763
Come here, man. Hey, can we get a photo?

608
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,597
- Thank you so much!
- Dude, you're my hero!

609
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,057
Hey, Parzival.

610
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,189
Thank you.

611
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,953
Get out of town! <i>Buckaroo Banzai?</i>

612
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,288
- Huh?
- I like it. I like <i>Buckaroo Banzai.</i>

613
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:10,953
- Oh, thanks!
- It's great!

614
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,837
- Yeah! You look...
- Oh.

615
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,256
You look awesome!

616
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,541
- Thank you.
- Wow.

617
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,052
A big one, a small one?

618
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:20,338
A big one!

619
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,570
Get out of here.

620
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,024
- What a freak!
- I thought he was kind of cute.

621
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,568
Have you been here before?

622
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,361
It's cool, right? I mean...

623
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,663
<i>So, what's the plan?</i>

624
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,120
<i>Are you gonna kill their avatars?
Zero them out?</i>

625
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,250
They're both here
at The Distracted Globe.

626
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,752
I can't talk.

627
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,622
<i>The Distracted Globe
was one of the first clubs</i>

628
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,881
<i>Halliday created in the OASIS.</i>

629
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,383
<i>That's common knowledge.</i>

630
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,010
But I double-checked

631
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:03,172
and it turns out he started building it
right after that moment you showed me.

632
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,339
The date with Kira.

633
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,554
Right, and she was a serious dancer.

634
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,639
Maybe he thought he'd take her here,

635
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,021
like on a virtual date.

636
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,810
As if that ever works.

637
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:14,642
So Halliday built it for her?

638
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,185
But they never made it
past the first date.

639
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,648
So Halliday's the creator...

640
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:18,812
Who hates his own creation.

641
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,113
And the club is the thing he hates.

642
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,775
And "A hidden key, a leap not taken"?

643
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,488
But people jump off it all night long.

644
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,497
But none of those people
had the Copper Key,

645
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,206
<i>so when we jump off,
maybe it's different. Right?</i>

646
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:34,286
<i>Right.</i>

647
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,461
So we take it together?

648
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,795
Sure.

649
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,761
We're not clanning up or anything.

650
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,969
Of course not. I don't clan.

651
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,092
Wait...

652
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,556
Whoa!

653
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,643
Ow! Whoa.

654
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:01,773
I don't think this is it.
No scoreboard, no obstacles.

655
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,566
- Maybe a dance challenge?
- Whoa!

656
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,049
Old-school!

657
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,612
You come prepared?

658
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:47,993
"Prepared"?

659
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,037
What kind of haptics you rockin'?

660
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,543
You got the gloves
and full visor, or a full body?

661
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:02,044
Can you feel this?

662
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,337
Um, yeah.

663
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,882
I got the X1 haptic bootsuit
with the microfiber crotch inlay.

664
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,234
My, Parzival, you did come prepared.

665
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,282
So, I've been thinking.

666
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,664
Maybe it'd be cool if
we met up in the real world.

667
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,245
No, you'd be disappointed.

668
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,877
No, I wouldn't. I like you.

669
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,129
You don't even know me.

670
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,961
This isn't what I really look like.

671
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:46,969
This isn't my real body,
or my real face.

672
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,674
I don't care.

673
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,055
I wanna know your real name.

674
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,111
- My name's Wade.
- What?

675
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,444
- I said my name's...
- Stop!

676
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,325
Well, Buckaroo blows it. Shocking.

677
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,953
Are you crazy?
You don't tell anyone who you are.

678
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:15,455
You can't use your real name.

679
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,705
You're not just anyone.

680
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:17,957
You don't know me.

681
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:19,743
You don't know anything about me.
We've never met.

682
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,661
I do know you, Arty.

683
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:24,957
I'm in love with you.

684
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,849
- Is this part of the challenge?
- No.

685
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:37,056
It's an ambush.

686
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,687
IOI, always in the way.

687
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:48,985
Did you hear what I said?
I said I'm in love with you.

688
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:50,524
No, you're not.

689
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,576
You only know what I want you to know.

690
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:55,578
You only see what I want you to see.

691
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,329
That's what you're in love with.

692
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,341
Watch out!

693
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,022
Pull.

694
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,705
Head back! Z! Your armor is running low.

695
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:43,994
I just bought this.

696
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,212
Zemeckis Cube.

697
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:55,221
Turns everything
back in time 60 seconds.

698
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,846
And you waited until now to use it?

699
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:12,106
Wow, you were amazing.

700
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,448
This isn't a game, Z.

701
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,576
I'm doing this to stop IOI.

702
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,082
I'm talking
about real-world consequences.

703
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:24,663
People suffering.

704
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:26,044
- Actual life-and-death stuff.
- I know. I know...

705
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:30,674
No, you don't know!
My dad died in a loyalty center.

706
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,343
- He borrowed gear.
- He built up debt.

707
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,139
He moved in with the promise of
working it off, but he never did.

708
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,016
IOI just raised his living expenses,

709
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,597
then he got sick,
and he couldn't afford to get out.

710
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,477
And then he died!

711
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:45,263
I'm so sorry, I didn't...

712
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,558
No, you don't live in the real world, Z.

713
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,478
From what you've told me,
I don't think you ever have.

714
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,235
You live inside this... This illusion,

715
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,400
and I can't afford
to let you distract me.

716
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,335
How the hell did they get away?

717
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,542
<i>Do you want the long version?
Your guys suck.</i>

718
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,255
<i>They failed to kill his avatar,</i>

719
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,512
<i>which, if we're offering
constructive criticism,</i>

720
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,344
<i>was a lame idea
and only would've slowed him down.</i>

721
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:24,683
<i>Whereas my plan, which was cool
because I rock, actually worked.</i>

722
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,266
He's still on the board.

723
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,979
<i>I know that, Nolan.
But he won't be for long.</i>

724
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,939
<i>I did a search for all the Wades</i>

725
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,149
<i>who had recently bought an X1 bootsuit,</i>

726
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:37,361
<i>cross-referenced that
with public records, and</i> voilà,

727
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:41,529
<i>which is French for...
"And then I found out."</i>

728
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,325
<i>Ready?</i>

729
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:48,164
<i>The real-world identity of Parzival
is Wade Watts.</i>

730
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,499
<i>Voilà.</i>

731
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,378
Are you loyal, Ms. Zandor?

732
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:56,710
You really want me to answer that?

733
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,253
Well, when you're at war,

734
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,513
you need people
who are loyal to a fault.

735
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,182
People you can count on
to get things done.

736
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:05,844
I just get people arrested
for not paying their bills.

737
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,764
Yeah, 'cause there are some problems
that require a physical solution,

738
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,354
but there are other times,
particularly at war,

739
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,063
when you need a different set of rules.

740
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:14,569
- The rules of war.
- Exactly.

741
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,481
It's too bad my division doesn't operate
inside the OASIS.

742
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,401
Yeah, but if this war
remains in the OASIS,

743
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,035
then you can't do anything.

744
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:25,743
So, this is one of those conversations
that we're not really having.

745
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,498
Well, we've had
these kind of conversations before,

746
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:28,658
and look where you are now.

747
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:31,249
You got a seat on the board,
head of your own division,

748
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:35,211
a division that will cease to exist
if the wrong person wins this contest.

749
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:38,548
F'Nale, a game decides our fate.

750
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:42,465
The only question is,
how far are we willing to go to win it?

751
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,722
Tell me what you need, Nolan.

752
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,590
Whoa.

753
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,427
Where am I?

754
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,348
IOI Plaza.
You're a hologram in the real world.

755
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,482
That's a really cool rig.

756
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:20,817
Thank you.
It's a brand-new Habashaw, OIR 9400.

757
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,696
It looks like a giant hamster ball.

758
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:27,577
You know, if you came to work at IOI,
you'd get one of these.

759
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,953
I don't clan up.

760
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:31,740
You'd also get your own
penthouse apartment in Columbus

761
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,034
with the highest-speed connection.

762
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:39,127
In the OASIS, you'd get unlimited
weapons, magic items, ships.

763
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,299
You want the ship from <i>Defender?</i>

764
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,051
You know, the kind
that can just jump into hyperspace?

765
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,053
You want the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>

766
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,005
You have that?

767
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,138
Anything you need
to help you find that egg,

768
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,597
and then there's the salary.

769
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,729
Four million a year.

770
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:59,313
And if you do happen to find
that Easter egg, there's a bonus.

771
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,728
Twenty-five million dollars.

772
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:10,575
I can see you're using
emotion-suppressing software right now,

773
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:13,582
and why wouldn't you?
It's smart, not to show your hand.

774
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,753
It is a lot of money.
I could really use it.

775
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,973
But I don't think you and I
would have the same plans.

776
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:33,010
Well, I don't know about that.
What, for the OASIS?

777
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:36,305
I guess
if you're not a John Hughes fan...

778
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,065
Of course I am.

779
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,692
Because the first thing that I would do

780
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,446
is convert all the schools
on Ludus to replicas

781
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:48,609
from <i>The Breakfast Club</i>
and <i>Ferris Bueller.</i>

782
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,028
No way. That's a great idea.

783
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,242
Which school, Ridgemont or Faber?

784
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:57,329
<i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High,</i>
not John Hughes.

785
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:00,587
It's a trap.
Faber College from <i>Animal House.</i>

786
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,042
John Hughes didn't direct

787
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:04,754
<i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>
or <i>Animal House.</i>

788
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,549
<i>Ferris Bueller</i> and <i>The Breakfast Club,</i>
they went to Shermer High School,

789
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,465
which is in Shermer, Illinois.
I know what you think.

790
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,803
You think I'm a corporate asshole,

791
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,185
that I don't appreciate
pop culture, but...

792
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:20,315
Man, that's not true.
You know, when I wanna blow off steam...

793
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:24,273
Drink Tab, play <i>Robotron,</i>
listen to Duran Duran.

794
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:25,857
I crack open a Tab.

795
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,273
I put on some Duran Duran.
I play <i>Robotron.</i>

796
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,407
That's why I love the OASIS.

797
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,741
'Cause it's just full
of all these things, man,

798
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:35,371
that people love. You know?

799
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:45,590
I'm a businessman. I get it.

800
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,376
But I gotta do my job.

801
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:53,299
But I didn't ask you here
just to help us find the egg, Parzival.

802
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:58,053
I asked you here for what comes after.

803
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,930
What would Halliday say?

804
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,688
James Halliday is dead.

805
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,901
Yeah. He is.

806
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:13,827
All that's left of him is this contest.
And you know what?

807
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:17,121
It just seems like
he wouldn't want you winning it.

808
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,452
A fanboy knows a hater,

809
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:21,208
and I know you've got a whole department
of oologists in your ear.

810
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,461
So, if you wanna know
what I really think...

811
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,087
I think you're full of shit.

812
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,551
Here's my offer.

813
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:33,463
Your board of directors,
you got them in the other ear?

814
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,506
Why don't you tell 'em this.

815
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:39,140
If they dump you, I'll consider it.

816
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,558
I might say something off the record.

817
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,099
I had to make the offer.

818
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:47,485
The board expected it,
but I was really hoping you'd say no.

819
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,897
Because if anyone's gonna win
this competition, it's me.

820
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,440
My avatar gets the egg

821
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:56,202
'cause I'm the only one here
with the balls to run this place.

822
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,829
Wow, you really switched gears there.

823
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,366
From fairly reasonable
to maniacal overlord.

824
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,997
You should be grateful, Wade.

825
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,252
<i>You won't be around
to endure my maniacal reign.</i>

826
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,124
Yeah, that's right. I know who you are.

827
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:14,888
Wade Owen Watts, born August 12, 2027.

828
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:19,392
I also know where you are.
Unit 56K, Columbus stacks.

829
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:22,144
You were last seen entering your trailer
three days ago.

830
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:23,680
You haven't left since.

831
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:24,847
What are you doing? You can't...

832
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,106
With all that's going on in the world,

833
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,938
do you really think that
anyone's gonna give a damn

834
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,101
about an explosion

835
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,987
in some ghetto trash rat warren
in Columbus?

836
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,240
Sorrento, don't do this.
I'm not even there!

837
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,241
Not for long.

838
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,994
Call Alice.

839
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,829
Dial Alice.

840
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,194
Pick up! Pick up! Alice!

841
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,614
This bootsuit's pretty awesome.
Thanks for that.

842
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,700
Rick! Rick, the place is gonna blow!

843
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,205
Rick, is that Wade?

844
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,412
- Put Alice on!
- Let me talk to him.

845
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,497
Don't call here anymore, you got me?

846
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:31,832
I don't wanna hear your voice
ever again.

847
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:12,418
Contact Aech, Daito, Sho, and Art3mis.

848
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,295
IOI came for me in the real world.

849
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:18,177
They gotta be coming after you,
so wherever you are...

850
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,197
Sorry about the blindfold.

851
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,491
My guys are a little paranoid.

852
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,959
Say that again.

853
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,921
My guys are a little paranoid.

854
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,461
Art3mis?

855
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:02,047
My real name is Samantha,
but yeah, I'm Art3mis.

856
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,638
Showers are that way,
clean clothes, too.

857
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,975
Welcome to the rebellion, Wade.

858
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:29,199
That's IOI.
So the stacks are over there?

859
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,498
We've been living this close
to each other the whole time?

860
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,292
Next door,

861
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:41,215
around the world,
it's all the same in the OASIS.

862
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,680
For the record,

863
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,554
um...

864
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,852
I'm not disappointed.

865
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,561
You said I would be disappointed
when I met you, but...

866
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,396
I'm not.

867
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:00,731
I've lived with it my whole life.
You don't have to pretend.

868
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,046
You have a birthmark, so what?

869
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,671
Why would that scare me?

870
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,176
Z, if I hurt you, I'm sorry.

871
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:31,723
No, it's...

872
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,105
Wait, did you just call me "Z"?

873
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,024
- Oh, my God. Did I?
- I think you did.

874
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,727
Wade, I'm sorry.

875
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:42,150
Yeah, Wade, Z.

876
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:45,442
You can call me whatever you want.
And I'll call you Sam.

877
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:46,609
No.

878
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:48,736
Samantha?

879
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,455
Okay. Cool.

880
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,505
Wow.

881
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,421
It's so much slower here.

882
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:08,135
I mean, the wind, the people...

883
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,847
Everything.

884
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,100
We forget what it's like to be outside.

885
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,559
Yeah.

886
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:26,274
- Uh...
- Oh, shit!

887
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:28,860
- I just figured it out.
- Figured what out?

888
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:30,403
The second clue. I know what it means.

889
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,286
We've been thinking about it
too literally.

890
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,870
"The leap not taken,"

891
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:42,461
the leap Halliday didn't take,
is with Kira.

892
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:46,298
Yeah, but... I mean, he blamed her
for breaking up him and Morrow.

893
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:49,259
No. Halliday was madly in love with her.

894
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,674
He had a chance with Kira.
He had a chance to kiss her, but...

895
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:52,932
He didn't take the leap.

896
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:55,766
Right. So that's where we go next.

897
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,306
The place where the leap wasn't taken.

898
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,473
Where the date was.

899
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,559
At the movies!

900
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,936
Hey, Curator.

901
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,946
We figured out the second clue.
The challenge is here.

902
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,982
Halliday kept track of every movie
he ever watched,

903
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,072
the week and the year he watched it,
and how many times.

904
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:15,331
Curator, can we see
November 23 to 27, 2025?

905
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:17,788
That's the week
he went on the date with Kira.

906
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:25,883
Okay, so our options for that week
are <i>The Fly</i> remake.

907
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,009
Great flick, terrible date movie.

908
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,762
<i>Say Anything...</i> That would make sense.

909
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:36,053
We gotta remember the clue.
"A creator who hates his own creation."

910
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,521
<i>The Shining!</i>

911
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:44,811
It's Halliday's
11th favorite horror film,

912
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:47,275
and it's based on the best-selling book
by Stephen King,

913
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:48,355
who hated the movie!

914
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,904
Hey! No side chitchat.

915
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,363
I think we found it.

916
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,704
Are you absolutely sure
you want to go here?

917
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,584
Absolutely positive.

918
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:03,167
Let's hope you have the belly for it.

919
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,630
Look.

920
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,127
Ticking clock.

921
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:54,047
Okay, so I'm estimating about

922
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,007
five minutes to find the key.

923
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:58,642
Yeah, there are so many keys
in <i>The Shining,</i> though.

924
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:00,223
Where do we start?

925
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:04,857
I've never seen <i>The Shining.</i>
Is it really scary?

926
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:08,232
Uh, I had to watch it
through my fingers.

927
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:11,321
Okay, so we got the key
from room 237,

928
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,691
the keys to the Snowcat,

929
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,530
or the keys they give Jack
at the beginning of the movie.

930
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:17,410
Well,
if it's "the leap not taken,"

931
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:18,487
maybe the key isn't a key at all.

932
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:19,872
I know where the Snowcat keys are!

933
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,077
I say we split up.

934
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,241
We get all the keys

935
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:24,369
and then we meet back
at the Torrances' apartment.

936
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:29,999
Hello, Danny.

937
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,877
Come play with us.

938
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:36,263
Little girls,
y'all know how to get out of here?

939
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,261
Wait, wait!

940
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:44,396
Wait, where's Aech?

941
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:45,807
Wait!

942
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:47,933
Aech!

943
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:49,772
No, no, no, no!

944
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:09,622
Ahh!

945
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,927
Ahh!

946
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:52,172
Oh, uh, hi, naked lady. I'm sorry.

947
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,083
I didn't mean to interrupt,
uh, your bath time.

948
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,214
I know self-care can be important.

949
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,593
Uh, but can you do me a favor
and tell me, where are all the exits?

950
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:04,719
Huh. Whoa.

951
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:07,020
Okay, am I being punked?

952
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,523
'Cause you're likin' me
a little way too much.

953
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:13,186
All right, you know what?
I'ma go with it.

954
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:27,787
Ahh!

955
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:06,364
Time's running out.

956
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,498
Yo, Z, is Art3mis pissed at me?

957
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:10,910
Dude, I'm pissed at you.
You've never seen <i>The Shining,</i> have you?

958
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,294
You know I hate scary movies!

959
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,453
We got the key.

960
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:14,872
Sweet! To room 237!

961
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:17,416
We ain't got no business
goin' to room 237!

962
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:18,584
We should stay out!

963
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,844
Plus, there was this crazy,
naked zombie lady in there.

964
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,505
There are no zombies in <i>The Shining.</i>

965
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:24,514
Well, maybe it's not supposed
to be like the movie.

966
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,220
Kira is the key.
You're the one who said it.

967
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:28,511
Hey, y'all. I saw a picture of Kira!

968
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,642
Huh?

969
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,228
Where?

970
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:44,531
It's Kira. "Escape your past."

971
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:47,203
"The leap not taken."

972
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,415
Halliday's greatest fear
wasn't <i>The Shining</i>

973
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:51,996
or any book or movie.

974
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:55,834
His biggest fear was kissing a girl.

975
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,920
That's the leap he couldn't take.

976
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,759
The ballroom.

977
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,492
Aech, come on.

978
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:31,039
Zombies. Told you.

979
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:33,709
That's her.

980
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,248
That's Kira.

981
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:40,503
None of this is in <i>The Shining.</i>

982
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:43,420
Z, look. That's the zombie-circle level
in <i>Mayhem Mansion,</i>

983
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,053
one of Halliday's first games.

984
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:47,010
The whole <i>Shining</i> trivia
is just a diversion.

985
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,849
One minute left.

986
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:52,473
How do we get to her?

987
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:53,637
Take the leap.

988
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:54,805
Wait!

989
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:57,315
Whoa!

990
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,862
Okay, Mr. Dead Guy. Cool if I lead?

991
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,449
Care to dance?

992
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:59,336
Do you know how long
I've been waiting for you to ask?

993
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,632
Well, well, well.

994
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:12,175
So you found my Jade Key.

995
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,599
Imagine that.

996
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:23,147
Thank you.

997
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,987
- Kira was a very beautiful...
- Go on.

998
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,978
One of our oologists saw them
enter the media library.

999
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,642
She cracked the clue.

1000
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,858
Now, we just have to win
<i>The Shining</i> challenge.

1001
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:12,659
Get her off me! Get her off me!

1002
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:26,666
Mr. Sorrento,
I really think you need to see this.

1003
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:30,590
Now Parzival's got the Jade Key.

1004
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,106
He's alive.

1005
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,734
I know. I'll get back to you.

1006
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,354
I got what you're looking for.

1007
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:56,495
Freeze. This guy.
The one with the lame tattoo.

1008
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:58,242
Enlarge.

1009
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:03,877
Run him through our database,
every IOI drone in Columbus.

1010
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,457
Find him.

1011
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,990
Groceries are here.

1012
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,234
All right. Gluten-O's...

1013
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,697
"If you know
the answer ultimate,

1014
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:37,994
"divide it by the number magic,

1015
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:41,783
"and what you need, want, and desire
will be found in the fortress tragic."

1016
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:43,951
"Tragic," that's gotta be Halliday
referring to himself.

1017
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,076
Why?

1018
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:46,287
Because he was lonely.

1019
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,797
He had no one to spend his life with
towards the end.

1020
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:49,873
Yeah, that's true.

1021
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,755
The contest has gotta be somehow
about connecting with someone.

1022
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:54,261
Anyone.

1023
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,796
He wants the person
who cares for the OASIS

1024
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:57,509
to be connected with the world.

1025
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,141
That's what I think
he's trying to tell us.

1026
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,766
Wade.

1027
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,482
You understand Halliday.

1028
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:14,648
You know him better than anyone.

1029
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:18,406
It's exactly why I think you'll win.

1030
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:22,660
Really? You really think I'm gonna win?

1031
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,336
Do not move!

1032
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,214
Target identified!

1033
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,841
Freeze! Don't move!

1034
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,268
- This leads right to the alley.
- You first.

1035
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,020
I'm right behind you. Go now!

1036
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,064
Come on!

1037
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:54,571
- Wade, the OASIS needs you.
- What?

1038
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,856
- I'm gonna delay them.
- Wait!

1039
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,820
No, no, no, wait! No, no, no!

1040
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,656
You'll forgive me for this, I promise.

1041
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,462
Freeze, freeze, freeze!

1042
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,498
Don't move!

1043
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,344
Samantha Evelyn Cook.

1044
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:25,010
IOI has purchased and consolidated
all of your outstanding debt,

1045
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:28,271
currently in excess of 23,000 credits.

1046
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:31,104
You will be remanded to the nearest
IOI loyalty center

1047
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:32,650
until your debt is paid in full,

1048
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:35,437
including any interest, processing,

1049
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:38,106
or late fees you incur henceforth.

1050
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:40,446
- Does anybody have eyes?
- Check down the next street!

1051
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:55,336
- "First to the key."
- "First to the egg."

1052
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:56,795
Wait, what?

1053
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:59,965
"Never trust someone you meet
in the OASIS."

1054
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:03,640
"She might be a 300-pound dude
named Chuck..."

1055
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:07,018
"Who lives in his mama's basement
in suburban Detroit."

1056
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,388
Aech!

1057
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:14,810
Helen. My dad called me Aech
It kinda stuck. Let's go!

1058
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:26,867
That thing's IDing my van.

1059
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:43,714
Come on. They've spotted us.

1060
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:45,548
Daito.

1061
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:48,807
My real name is Toshiro.
Samantha got us a message.

1062
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,641
She told us to meet you here.

1063
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,056
Samantha, they took her to the...

1064
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:53,644
The loyalty center, I know.

1065
01:16:53,818 --> 01:16:57,027
Look, in other awesome news,
the Sixers found the third challenge.

1066
01:16:57,822 --> 01:16:59,563
- What?
- Just come on, get in!

1067
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:00,730
All right. Let's go.

1068
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:03,074
Hurry up. Go, go, go. All right.

1069
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:17,172
How did IOI find
the third challenge so fast?

1070
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:19,298
IOI cracked
the first three lines of the clue,

1071
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:20,504
so they knew it was sector 14

1072
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:22,465
but they couldn't figure out
"the fortress tragic."

1073
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,971
So they sent every guide
they had into that sector

1074
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:27,007
until they found the right fortress.

1075
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:29,430
Sho?

1076
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:31,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm 11, so what?

1077
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,763
His real name is Xo.

1078
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:36,524
But everyone else calls me Sho,
no big deal.

1079
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:39,311
No. It is a big deal.

1080
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:42,902
Sho, you're the world's most badass
11-year-old ever.

1081
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,023
He knows.

1082
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:46,155
Shut up! Let him tell me.

1083
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:47,364
Aech!

1084
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,452
We have to go save Samantha.

1085
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:54,834
Well, we can't just
go through the doors of IOI.

1086
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,041
Look, I've been thinkin' about it.
I got a better plan.

1087
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:59,046
You saw Sorrento's rig, right?

1088
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:00,206
Yeah.

1089
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:03,593
Let's go after the man himself and
make him give Art3mis back to us.

1090
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:05,503
But first, I have to know exactly,

1091
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,593
how much about Sorrento's rig
do you remember?

1092
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:11,301
Kind of everything.

1093
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:28,910
<i>Maintenance,
report to loyalty pod 31-B.</i>

1094
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:37,582
<i>Security, please report
to section 97 for escort.</i>

1095
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,188
Hey! Newbie, get to work.

1096
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:04,737
Get to work.

1097
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:13,913
<i>Work violation.
Work violation.</i>

1098
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:18,747
Lay those charges every six feet.

1099
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:25,918
Keep it moving!

1100
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:28,253
Hey, you!

1101
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,173
Those are explosives!

1102
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:37,012
IOI will not reimburse any lost coin
if you zero out.

1103
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,930
Keep it moving!

1104
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:46,564
So what is this challenge,
some sort of video game thing?

1105
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,652
An Atari 2600, sir.

1106
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:52,365
And every game ever made for it,
thousands of possibilities.

1107
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:54,195
Come up!

1108
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,330
Halliday,

1109
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:01,870
this is how you plan to resolve

1110
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,085
the fate of the world's
most important economic resource?

1111
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:07,671
- Call me when you're close.
- Yes, sir.

1112
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,381
Go, go! No! Ahh!

1113
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,508
One minute into <i>Centipede,</i>
the ice broke.

1114
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,426
It has to be <i>Joust!</i>

1115
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:19,726
Halliday still holds the world record
on the 2600 port of that game.

1116
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,309
Maybe we just need
to beat his high score.

1117
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:24,021
<i>Pitfall!</i> One of the only 2600 games
that still hasn't ended.

1118
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:25,310
And how about
those <i>Swordquest</i> games?

1119
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,523
Yes! The <i>Swordquest</i> games.

1120
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:29,531
They were created
for a contest Atari held with real...

1121
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,907
i-R0k, how are we doin'?

1122
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:42,377
To be honest, I think I need
physical therapy because it's not...

1123
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,538
Is the Orb ready?

1124
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,211
Um, as you wish.

1125
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:52,378
The Orb...

1126
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:53,967
Of Osuvox.

1127
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:55,931
Ah...

1128
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:57,384
How does it work?

1129
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:01,350
Has it got, like, a remote
or is there a button or something?

1130
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,982
Nolan, it's a level-99 magic artifact,

1131
01:21:05,152 --> 01:21:08,771
not one of your drones,
so it is activated by a magic spell.

1132
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,984
Would you care to do the honors?

1133
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,167
Where is she?

1134
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:05,452
How'd you get in here?

1135
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:06,745
- Art3mis.
- Who?

1136
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,960
Samantha Cook. Where is she?

1137
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:14,961
If you wanna talk, we can talk,
but you gotta put that gun down.

1138
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:17,805
You killed my mom's sister.

1139
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:19,883
You think I won't kill you?

1140
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:24,058
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just slow down, okay?

1141
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:27,440
That was a corporate decision.
It was not personal.

1142
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:28,599
Where is she?

1143
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:31,110
She's downstairs in the loyalty center!

1144
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,023
I know
she's in the goddamn loyalty center.

1145
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,903
You're gonna tell me
exactly which rig she's in

1146
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:39,410
and the access code to contact her.

1147
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:42,739
Yeah, that seems appropriate.

1148
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,619
Start with access code.

1149
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:50,956
6, 45, 7, 25.

1150
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:52,374
Where's the rig?

1151
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:04,894
I think he pissed himself.

1152
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:07,354
Good job, Z. We're in his account.

1153
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:09,265
So he really doesn't know
he's in the OASIS?

1154
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:14,066
This is what Sorrento should be seeing,

1155
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:17,357
but this... This is what we're
making him see.

1156
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:21,362
We grabbed him in transit just
as he was logging out of the OASIS,

1157
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:24,201
so he thinks he's back in his office
in the real world.

1158
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:28,080
But actually, he's here,
in the identical office that Aech built.

1159
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:30,791
So, you basically
just remotely hacked his rig.

1160
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:33,832
A fixed rig like Sorrento's
is easy to locate, hard to hack.

1161
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,547
Unless he's stupid enough
to leave his password lying around.

1162
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:37,961
Loyalty center, I'm in.

1163
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:39,879
All right, let's get to work.

1164
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,851
<i>- Arty.</i>
- Z? Z? Z?

1165
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,391
Arty, don't say anything.

1166
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:53,525
I'm tapped directly
into your audio feed.

1167
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:56,236
<i>How did you find me?</i>

1168
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:58,363
We got his password,
hacked Sorrento's rig.

1169
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:01,734
Z, I have something to tell you.

1170
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,279
<i>Not now. I have something to show you
that'll get you out of there.</i>

1171
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:07,039
The Sixers found the third challenge.
It's on Planet Doom.

1172
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:09,284
And there's more,
they just put a force field

1173
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:11,248
around Anorak's Castle.

1174
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:18,209
I heard one of the guards calling it
"the Orb of Osuvox,"

1175
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,754
and the only way to take it down
is from the inside.

1176
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:23,924
She's right. Level-99 artifact,

1177
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:26,889
creates a magic-resistant,
impenetrable barrier.

1178
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,052
No way through it.

1179
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:29,641
Okay, listen.
That's not important right now.

1180
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:31,852
What's important is
that we get you out of the rig.

1181
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:36,940
<i>All right, so I'm looking at a diagram
of your rig.</i>

1182
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,942
If you reach up with your left hand
at 11 o'clock,

1183
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:43,906
there's a panel above your head.

1184
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:50,701
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I can feel it.

1185
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:52,664
<i>Okay, there should be
two release handles.</i>

1186
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:54,249
<i>Nine o'clock and three o'clock.
Can you feel them?</i>

1187
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:56,756
- Yeah, I got it.
<i>- Okay, pull it towards you.</i>

1188
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:00,627
<i>Okay, inside the panel, there's a lever.</i>

1189
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:03,262
<i>Grab it with your right hand
and slide it to the left.</i>

1190
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:04,843
<i>That should release you.</i>

1191
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,977
It worked. It worked, I'm out.

1192
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:16,980
<i>Loyalty pod 41-F,</i>

1193
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:19,983
<i>you are on an authorized
break for 10 minutes.</i>

1194
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:28,322
<i>Pod 41-F, you are on 10-minute break.</i>

1195
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:30,615
<i>Proceed to break area.</i>

1196
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:33,125
Wade, are you still there?

1197
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:34,331
<i>Yeah, I'm here. Where are you?</i>

1198
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:35,585
Where is Sorrento's office?

1199
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:37,964
<i>It's in the IOI war room,
two levels above where you are now.</i>

1200
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,749
<i>But that's not the way out.</i>

1201
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:41,462
What's his password?

1202
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:43,920
Wade, answer me.

1203
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:47,966
<i>Okay, it's capital B-0-55-man-69.</i>

1204
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:50,351
<i>But, Arty, you need to go.</i>

1205
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,806
You need to raise an army.

1206
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:53,721
An army?

1207
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:55,891
<i>Get to Planet Doom,
and wait for my signal.</i>

1208
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:56,974
What signal?

1209
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:58,484
I'm gonna take down that shield.

1210
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:01,067
<i>Wait, Arty, wait!
You gotta get out of there! Arty!</i>

1211
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:12,206
Hey, how much are they paying you?

1212
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:13,992
'Cause, man, I got a lot of paper.

1213
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,377
You know, I can make you,
like, a forest.

1214
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:18,663
Hey, shut up.

1215
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:19,921
Okay.

1216
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:44,734
This isn't real, you're tapping my feed.

1217
01:26:44,825 --> 01:26:46,817
Uh-oh. Guys.

1218
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:07,925
F'Nale, they've hacked my rig.
They're after the girl.

1219
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:09,760
Meet me at loyalty.

1220
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:27,319
<i>Pod 41-F,
you have exceeded your break time.</i>

1221
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:31,202
<i>Report to security or your coin count
will be reset to zero.</i>

1222
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:44,792
So, she just walks out of here,
how does that happen?

1223
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:47,005
They're smart.
They knew what they were doing.

1224
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:49,922
But we know they're in Columbus.
And now, all five of them are together.

1225
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,431
Wait. Wait, we know what?
How do we know?

1226
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:56,185
We have the make and model of the van.
We'll spot them.

1227
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,311
"We'll spot them"?

1228
01:27:58,482 --> 01:28:01,566
That sounds like a great inscription
for our tombstones.

1229
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:03,101
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

1230
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,689
It wasn't relevant yet.

1231
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:05,944
I need to know where they are.

1232
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,480
We need to know. We need to find them!

1233
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:10,525
They're kids, Nolan. Man the hell up!

1234
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:13,740
Do your job, and I'll do mine,
unless you wanna take this

1235
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:15,906
and go after them yourself.

1236
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:21,745
Find them!

1237
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:35,350
<i>The Complete Nancy Drew,</i>
Kegel Exercises for...

1238
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,182
Bingo. Okay.

1239
01:28:39,773 --> 01:28:41,856
"Congratulations, you are
the proud owner of the Orb of Osuvox,

1240
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:43,357
"a 99th level magic artifact.

1241
01:28:43,527 --> 01:28:46,645
"Read these instructions
before deploying. To turn orb on, off."

1242
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:48,154
Off! Yes, off.

1243
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:50,565
"Utter spell within 10 feet of orb."

1244
01:29:04,548 --> 01:29:06,585
Citizens of the OASIS,

1245
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:09,045
I am Parzival, first to the key.

1246
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:12,462
I'm here talking to all of you now
because our future's being threatened

1247
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,723
by people who will stop at nothing
to win this contest.

1248
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:18,467
Some of you already know this,

1249
01:29:18,645 --> 01:29:21,934
and you've lost much more
than just your avatars or your weapons.

1250
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:26,601
Some have lost their freedom.
Some have lost their lives.

1251
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:31,071
And now, this.

1252
01:29:31,908 --> 01:29:34,867
<i>A force field
around the third challenge.</i>

1253
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:40,532
<i>I only came here to escape
the shitty hand that life dealt me.</i>

1254
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:44,035
<i>But I stayed, like many of you,</i>

1255
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:48,832
<i>because I found something
much bigger than just myself.</i>

1256
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:51,088
<i>I found a cause.</i>

1257
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:54,345
<i>I found my friends.</i>

1258
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:58,971
And yes, I know
it's kind of a groaner, but...

1259
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:01,894
<i>I found love.</i>

1260
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:04,475
<i>And I don't wanna lose that</i>

1261
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:07,312
<i>to this colossal douchebag,
Nolan Sorrento.</i>

1262
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:10,944
This guy. Back to work, people.

1263
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:14,532
<i>He thinks that we're all
too distracted to even notice...</i>

1264
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:20,572
<i>Nolan Sorrento thinks
that we won't put up a fight.</i>

1265
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:21,910
Sir! Sir!

1266
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:22,990
This is going out live!

1267
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:24,165
<i>The only thing
Halliday let this guy do...</i>

1268
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,578
- It's absolutely everywhere.
<i>- ...was get him a cup of coffee.</i>

1269
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:28,417
<i>And now, we're supposed
to hand him the OASIS?</i>

1270
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:39,091
This Parzival... Oh, man.

1271
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:45,521
Come on, come on. Give me this thing.

1272
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:46,806
Yes, sir.

1273
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:49,482
Left arm.

1274
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:51,986
- Left arm!
- Sir.

1275
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:53,987
No, I need the left arm.

1276
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:56,444
No, I don't care if... I want it on.

1277
01:30:58,578 --> 01:31:01,036
He thinks
that we won't even put up a fight!

1278
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:03,739
Well, I say he's wrong.

1279
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:07,536
I say, tell that to the gunter clans
in the gold mines of Gygax.

1280
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:10,876
Activate the Iron Giant.

1281
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:39,947
Ask yourselves, are you willing
to zero out for the OASIS?

1282
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,986
Are you willing to fight?

1283
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:45,869
I am Parzival of the High Five.

1284
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:48,625
In the name of Art3mis,
in the name of Aech,

1285
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:50,912
in the name of Daito and Sho,

1286
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:54,044
we ask you to join us on Planet Doom.

1287
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:58,010
In the name of James Halliday himself,

1288
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,171
help us save the OASIS.

1289
01:32:55,195 --> 01:32:57,562
No, no, no, no.

1290
01:33:07,707 --> 01:33:10,245
"No man is a failure who has friends."

1291
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,604
<i>Squadron 14, armor up,
you're in the lead.</i>

1292
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:51,248
One minute into <i>Swordquest,</i>
the ice broke.

1293
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:56,545
Well, all three <i>Swordquests.</i>
What's next?

1294
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:58,376
<i>Dark Cavern, Laser Blast.</i>

1295
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:59,631
It's <i>Adventure.</i>

1296
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:01,884
Released in 1979, for the 2600,

1297
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:03,589
<i>Adventure</i> was created by
Warren Robinett,

1298
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:06,130
who was the first video game designer
ever to hide his name. In fact...

1299
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:08,299
Try <i>Adventure.</i>

1300
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:11,052
Play <i>Adventure.</i>

1301
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:05,610
More than a minute, we're still alive.

1302
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,570
This must be the right game.

1303
01:35:14,584 --> 01:35:17,372
How long does it last, this orb thing?

1304
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:27,427
I'd say about ten...

1305
01:35:27,597 --> 01:35:30,681
Yeah, about 10 million years,
so we should be fine.

1306
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,866
First to the key!

1307
01:35:50,036 --> 01:35:51,698
First to the egg!

1308
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:54,534
First to the egg!

1309
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:24,150
<i>Adventure.</i>

1310
01:36:40,586 --> 01:36:42,794
What? Come on!

1311
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:13,992
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1312
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:18,747
The Sixers are in the final challenge.
It's an Atari 2600.

1313
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:20,623
Are you in the Sixer war room?

1314
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:22,580
No, no, no. You gotta get out of there.

1315
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:24,416
They're playing <i>Adventure.</i>

1316
01:37:25,048 --> 01:37:27,290
<i>Adventure,</i> of course!

1317
01:37:27,467 --> 01:37:28,924
Created by Warren Robinett!

1318
01:37:29,093 --> 01:37:30,629
He was the first designer
to ever hide an Easter egg in...

1319
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:31,793
Dude!

1320
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,514
We're looking for a USPS truck,
Ohio plates,

1321
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:42,680
a drone spitter, 2036 model.

1322
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:04,584
Daito! When are you
getting into this fight?

1323
01:38:18,309 --> 01:38:19,675
I'm out. Inventory's empty.

1324
01:38:19,852 --> 01:38:20,842
Last clip for me.

1325
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:22,056
More weapons!

1326
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:26,315
Anti-personnel ordinance cannon!

1327
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:31,941
Railgun!

1328
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:38,322
Yo, Z!

1329
01:38:38,871 --> 01:38:42,490
Yo, Z! Try this little guy.

1330
01:38:46,087 --> 01:38:47,248
Ow!

1331
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:49,587
Get rid of it! Get rid of it!

1332
01:38:50,716 --> 01:38:52,503
It's fucking Chucky!

1333
01:38:57,849 --> 01:38:59,340
Move! Move!

1334
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:01,425
Go, go, go!

1335
01:39:59,202 --> 01:40:00,693
Mechagodzilla!

1336
01:40:21,891 --> 01:40:25,225
Daito, we need you! Daito, now!

1337
01:40:25,394 --> 01:40:27,556
Get to the bridge.
Go now, he's distracted.

1338
01:40:27,647 --> 01:40:28,637
Go, go, go.

1339
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:10,971
Z!

1340
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:31,908
Arty!

1341
01:41:32,003 --> 01:41:34,245
Get to the castle!
Win the third key before they do!

1342
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:47,224
What is that?

1343
01:41:47,393 --> 01:41:50,101
He's only got 30 seconds
before changing back!

1344
01:42:01,324 --> 01:42:04,192
Daito, abort, abort! You got 10 seconds!

1345
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:20,090
First to the egg!

1346
01:42:59,548 --> 01:43:00,834
Shit, it's her.

1347
01:43:20,903 --> 01:43:23,441
Arty! Arty!

1348
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:26,448
Z! Got to get to the castle!

1349
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:35,373
She never left. She's still here.

1350
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:39,828
The girl's in the war room.

1351
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,538
No, no, no.

1352
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:36,222
Sho! Hang on!

1353
01:44:55,664 --> 01:44:57,246
No!

1354
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:21,221
Arty, we've got this.
You need to log out.

1355
01:45:21,649 --> 01:45:24,232
If the game is <i>Adventure,</i>
why haven't they won yet?

1356
01:45:24,401 --> 01:45:26,108
I don't know. Arty, Arty.

1357
01:45:26,278 --> 01:45:28,190
I'm serious, Sorrento's crazy.
He'll kill you.

1358
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:31,906
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

1359
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:34,150
There's nothing over there.

1360
01:45:35,204 --> 01:45:36,194
You're in trouble, aren't you?

1361
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:43,035
Samantha, you know I love you.

1362
01:45:43,212 --> 01:45:44,419
Not the time, Z.

1363
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:45,874
I can handle the challenge,

1364
01:45:46,048 --> 01:45:47,880
but I can't let you get hurt
in the real world.

1365
01:45:49,134 --> 01:45:52,298
Get out of IOI,
and meet us at River South.

1366
01:45:58,686 --> 01:46:00,222
Wade, no.

1367
01:46:00,396 --> 01:46:02,103
You'll forgive me for this, I promise.

1368
01:46:02,273 --> 01:46:03,389
Wade, no, no, no.

1369
01:46:13,534 --> 01:46:16,527
Get it together, Sixer. Back to respawn.

1370
01:46:16,996 --> 01:46:18,157
Let's go, move.

1371
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:19,537
You're in.

1372
01:46:37,808 --> 01:46:40,266
Holy hand grenade!
How much did that cost?

1373
01:46:40,436 --> 01:46:42,894
Less than it's gonna cost them.

1374
01:46:44,023 --> 01:46:45,514
What is that?

1375
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:58,448
Sir, the gunters are approaching
the challenge.

1376
01:46:58,621 --> 01:47:00,487
- i-R0k?
- In position, sir.

1377
01:47:00,623 --> 01:47:01,613
Prepare my rig.

1378
01:47:01,916 --> 01:47:04,533
The ice is holding. Still going.

1379
01:47:14,887 --> 01:47:16,048
Wait.

1380
01:47:16,221 --> 01:47:17,337
He's trying to win.

1381
01:47:20,726 --> 01:47:23,264
Yeah! I won.

1382
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:28,561
He lost.

1383
01:47:28,734 --> 01:47:30,726
Not <i>Adventure.</i>

1384
01:47:34,865 --> 01:47:39,155
Everyone who wins loses.

1385
01:47:39,328 --> 01:47:42,617
It's not about winning.
It's about playing.

1386
01:47:43,749 --> 01:47:45,786
Remember Halliday's announcement.

1387
01:47:46,251 --> 01:47:48,493
The keys are invisible,
and they're hidden in a dark room

1388
01:47:48,671 --> 01:47:50,628
that's at the center of a maze.

1389
01:47:51,256 --> 01:47:54,749
Well, there's a secret in <i>Adventure,</i>
and you don't find it by winning.

1390
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:57,340
You find it
by wandering around in a dark room.

1391
01:47:57,846 --> 01:47:59,382
Until you get to the invisible dot.

1392
01:47:59,556 --> 01:48:01,092
It's pretty easy
if you know what you're doing.

1393
01:48:01,266 --> 01:48:02,507
Really?

1394
01:48:03,435 --> 01:48:05,472
Let me finish it for you.

1395
01:48:09,775 --> 01:48:11,016
It's your last chance, Wade.

1396
01:48:11,694 --> 01:48:14,437
Last chance. Give me the key.

1397
01:48:14,613 --> 01:48:18,698
I give you 50 million
in your account right now.

1398
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:21,401
Why the hell would I ever do that?

1399
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:24,867
Dude! That's the Cataclyst.

1400
01:48:25,165 --> 01:48:26,872
Now, personally, I don't care.

1401
01:48:27,042 --> 01:48:28,624
I'd just as soon
never set foot in the OASIS again,

1402
01:48:28,794 --> 01:48:30,786
let alone have to deal
with any of this absurdity.

1403
01:48:30,963 --> 01:48:34,252
But I know how important
Halliday's competition is to you, so...

1404
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:40,420
I will never let the future of the OASIS
rest in your hands, Nolan Sorrento.

1405
01:48:40,597 --> 01:48:44,466
Well, that's fine.
Three easy steps. One.

1406
01:48:44,643 --> 01:48:46,930
Wait, I thought you were bluffing.
You know that kills all of us, right?

1407
01:48:47,104 --> 01:48:49,016
I've got 10 years' worth of shit
inside of me.

1408
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:50,680
Last chance. Two.

1409
01:48:50,858 --> 01:48:52,065
I'm not goin' out like that.

1410
01:48:52,234 --> 01:48:53,315
That's a camper move.

1411
01:48:53,485 --> 01:48:54,646
You don't even know
how to activate an orb.

1412
01:49:07,082 --> 01:49:08,163
Yeah, I felt those.

1413
01:49:09,585 --> 01:49:11,668
But this is my world, Sorrento.

1414
01:49:15,632 --> 01:49:16,873
Hadouken!

1415
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:38,945
- No, no, no!
- Step three.

1416
01:49:39,114 --> 01:49:40,821
No, no, no!

1417
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:40,002
Get me out of this thing.

1418
01:50:54,481 --> 01:50:55,813
Uh...

1419
01:50:55,899 --> 01:50:57,140
Guys?

1420
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:05,572
Z. He's still alive!

1421
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,287
Extra life.

1422
01:51:17,713 --> 01:51:19,124
Thanks, Curator.

1423
01:51:22,009 --> 01:51:23,125
Hold on.

1424
01:51:30,893 --> 01:51:32,885
Live feed in all OASIS channels.

1425
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,933
Halliday's letting everyone
watch the end of the contest.

1426
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:37,313
That's so Halliday.

1427
01:51:37,482 --> 01:51:39,565
God damn it, we tried <i>Adventure.</i>

1428
01:51:39,735 --> 01:51:41,021
No, we tried to win it.

1429
01:51:41,195 --> 01:51:43,608
But the hidden room isn't
at the end of the game.

1430
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:46,523
You've gotta go straight
to the invisible dot at the start.

1431
01:51:59,963 --> 01:52:00,953
Is that her?

1432
01:52:01,256 --> 01:52:05,250
Red hair, IOI uniform,
doesn't know what planet she's on?

1433
01:52:05,344 --> 01:52:06,380
That's her.

1434
01:52:18,232 --> 01:52:20,940
I'm Toshiro. You know me as Daito.

1435
01:52:23,862 --> 01:52:24,898
Oh.

1436
01:52:27,658 --> 01:52:29,069
Hey, Arty.

1437
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:35,113
Yeah, I know.
Not what you were expecting, huh?

1438
01:52:35,290 --> 01:52:39,830
Yeah, I wasn't expecting
a late '30s-model postal van.

1439
01:52:41,922 --> 01:52:42,912
Wade?

1440
01:52:43,632 --> 01:52:45,874
Wait, I thought the Cataclyst went off.
How are you still playing?

1441
01:52:46,051 --> 01:52:48,543
Extra life, long story.
Sorry I shot you.

1442
01:52:50,889 --> 01:52:52,346
Sho?

1443
01:52:52,516 --> 01:52:54,883
What? Do I have to wear a sign saying,

1444
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:58,019
"I am 11 years old, shoot me first"?
No, thanks.

1445
01:52:58,188 --> 01:53:00,350
- Dude, give me a hug.
- Ninjas don't hug!

1446
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,931
All right, everybody,
hold on to somethin'.

1447
01:53:23,839 --> 01:53:25,125
Got you.

1448
01:53:28,885 --> 01:53:30,592
Come on, Nolan. Pick up.

1449
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:35,344
F'Nale, tell me something good.

1450
01:53:35,642 --> 01:53:38,009
I've got a drone on their tail.
I'm close.

1451
01:53:38,186 --> 01:53:39,222
<i>Send me coordinates.</i>

1452
01:53:39,396 --> 01:53:41,604
Maybe you should
leave this to me, Nolan.

1453
01:53:43,483 --> 01:53:46,066
Nolan? Nolan.

1454
01:53:47,529 --> 01:53:48,645
Out.

1455
01:53:57,622 --> 01:54:00,080
Give me that.

1456
01:54:03,795 --> 01:54:05,502
What's goin' on out there?

1457
01:54:09,885 --> 01:54:12,343
The game is over for them.
What are they watching?

1458
01:54:14,848 --> 01:54:17,135
The final key! It's being broadcast.

1459
01:54:19,227 --> 01:54:20,718
<i>You see,</i>

1460
01:54:20,896 --> 01:54:23,434
<i>Warren Robinett was proud of</i> Adventure.

1461
01:54:23,607 --> 01:54:25,815
<i>He wanted people to know
who was behind it.</i>

1462
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:29,231
That's why he created
the first digital Easter egg

1463
01:54:29,404 --> 01:54:31,942
and to find it,
you didn't even have to win.

1464
01:54:32,115 --> 01:54:36,109
You just had to blindly play,
searching around

1465
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:39,370
in rooms for an invisible dot.

1466
01:54:40,415 --> 01:54:42,828
You took the dot back to the main screen

1467
01:54:43,001 --> 01:54:47,462
and that's when you found the first
Easter egg ever put in a video game.

1468
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:48,872
The creator's name.

1469
01:55:13,573 --> 01:55:15,360
What's going on, man? I can't see shit.

1470
01:55:15,659 --> 01:55:17,025
Parzival just got the Crystal Key!

1471
01:55:32,342 --> 01:55:34,049
Do you want it or not?

1472
01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:39,176
Aech, what the hell's going on?

1473
01:55:39,474 --> 01:55:41,306
Just practicing my <i>Mario Kart.</i>
What do you think?

1474
01:55:41,476 --> 01:55:43,513
IOI's trying to kill us, man!

1475
01:55:57,784 --> 01:55:59,946
Everyone watching,
if you're in the Columbus stacks,

1476
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:01,406
this is Parzival.

1477
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:04,197
My real-world name is Wade Watts,
and we're gonna need your help.

1478
01:56:04,374 --> 01:56:05,785
Aech, head for the stacks!

1479
01:56:05,959 --> 01:56:07,575
Okay, hold on!

1480
01:56:32,861 --> 01:56:34,818
Stick the key in, how hard is it?

1481
01:56:40,535 --> 01:56:41,696
Come on.

1482
01:56:49,169 --> 01:56:51,161
Yeah! Yes!

1483
01:57:07,395 --> 01:57:08,602
That's it?

1484
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:10,475
Yeah, that's it.

1485
01:57:10,649 --> 01:57:15,644
Now, you just sign these papers,
and the OASIS is yours.

1486
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:19,939
You will be its sole proprietor.

1487
01:57:20,116 --> 01:57:21,573
That ain't so bad, is it?

1488
01:57:43,431 --> 01:57:44,467
I'm gonna need a second.

1489
01:58:13,169 --> 01:58:15,161
This is wrong.

1490
01:58:15,797 --> 01:58:18,665
This pen, this contract.

1491
01:58:21,928 --> 01:58:23,510
This is the moment
that Halliday made Morrow

1492
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:25,546
sign over his shares in Gregarious.

1493
01:58:26,266 --> 01:58:28,349
That was the biggest mistake
of his life.

1494
01:58:28,935 --> 01:58:31,052
He knew that.

1495
01:58:32,814 --> 01:58:34,851
This can't be the end.

1496
01:58:36,067 --> 01:58:37,774
It's a test.

1497
01:58:42,324 --> 01:58:44,987
I won't make the same mistake you did.

1498
01:58:50,707 --> 01:58:52,573
Oh, good.

1499
01:58:55,295 --> 01:58:58,709
I just needed to be sure.

1500
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:14,937
This is where you grew up.

1501
01:59:24,199 --> 01:59:26,566
Oh, that's just me a long time ago.

1502
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:29,868
I like to have him around
from time to time.

1503
01:59:30,747 --> 01:59:32,363
Hey, I have to show you something.

1504
01:59:33,041 --> 01:59:34,577
This... Come on.

1505
01:59:34,751 --> 01:59:36,413
This is the button.

1506
01:59:36,586 --> 01:59:39,704
If you push it,
the whole simulation shuts down

1507
01:59:39,881 --> 01:59:43,340
and a tapeworm program will erase
all of the backup servers.

1508
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:46,753
So you now have the power
to turn the OASIS off forever.

1509
01:59:47,263 --> 01:59:48,845
Do you understand?

1510
01:59:54,270 --> 01:59:55,260
Yeah,

1511
01:59:55,438 --> 01:59:57,225
try not to accidentally erase

1512
01:59:57,399 --> 02:00:00,062
the whole of the OASIS
on your first day.

1513
02:00:09,452 --> 02:00:11,159
The stacks are straight ahead!

1514
02:00:26,970 --> 02:00:29,758
Well, I expect you have to go.
I know I do.

1515
02:00:29,931 --> 02:00:32,298
So, now is the time for you
to receive your prize

1516
02:00:32,475 --> 02:00:34,842
because you won all three keys.

1517
02:00:35,019 --> 02:00:39,013
Once you take this egg,
the game will be over.

1518
02:00:39,733 --> 02:00:42,771
The egg, the egg...

1519
02:00:50,243 --> 02:00:52,485
We know what you did here.

1520
02:00:52,662 --> 02:00:55,951
You turn around and
walk out of here while you still can.

1521
02:01:08,595 --> 02:01:10,962
I created the OASIS

1522
02:01:11,139 --> 02:01:14,803
because I never felt at home
in the real world.

1523
02:01:15,894 --> 02:01:19,183
I just didn't know how to connect
with the people there.

1524
02:01:20,356 --> 02:01:23,224
I was afraid for all of my life.

1525
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:26,603
Right up until the day
I knew my life was ending.

1526
02:01:32,243 --> 02:01:36,078
Now, that... That was when
I realized that,

1527
02:01:37,248 --> 02:01:42,334
as terrifying and painful
as reality can be,

1528
02:01:43,213 --> 02:01:47,207
it's also the only place

1529
02:01:48,885 --> 02:01:50,501
that you can get a decent meal.

1530
02:01:57,185 --> 02:01:58,676
Because

1531
02:02:00,438 --> 02:02:02,020
reality

1532
02:02:07,195 --> 02:02:08,686
is real.

1533
02:02:08,863 --> 02:02:10,570
You understand what I'm saying?

1534
02:02:12,408 --> 02:02:15,025
Yes. Yes, I do.

1535
02:02:24,838 --> 02:02:26,079
He did it.

1536
02:02:27,799 --> 02:02:29,256
He got the egg.

1537
02:02:30,093 --> 02:02:31,334
Hooray.

1538
02:02:32,512 --> 02:02:34,128
- No!
- No! Please!

1539
02:03:07,714 --> 02:03:08,955
Hold it!

1540
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:14,043
Drop the gun! Now! On the ground!

1541
02:03:14,804 --> 02:03:17,387
Turn around! Hands on your head.

1542
02:03:17,557 --> 02:03:19,093
Walk back towards me.

1543
02:03:34,824 --> 02:03:39,239
Mr. Halliday.
Something I don't understand.

1544
02:03:40,079 --> 02:03:42,787
You're not an avatar, are you?

1545
02:03:43,416 --> 02:03:45,032
No.

1546
02:03:46,586 --> 02:03:48,578
Is Halliday really dead?

1547
02:03:50,256 --> 02:03:51,838
Yes.

1548
02:03:57,597 --> 02:03:59,338
Then what are you?

1549
02:04:02,602 --> 02:04:04,559
Goodbye, Parzival.

1550
02:04:06,230 --> 02:04:07,311
Thanks.

1551
02:04:08,858 --> 02:04:11,066
Thanks for playing my game.

1552
02:04:40,098 --> 02:04:41,384
Wade?

1553
02:04:42,809 --> 02:04:44,550
- Ogden Morrow?
- Ogden Morrow?

1554
02:04:44,727 --> 02:04:46,343
You can call me "Og."

1555
02:04:46,521 --> 02:04:49,264
Now, there are some people out here
that would very much like to meet you.

1556
02:04:49,857 --> 02:04:52,520
Wow, this is incredible.

1557
02:04:53,111 --> 02:04:55,854
It's an honor to meet you, Og, but I...

1558
02:05:00,076 --> 02:05:01,738
There's something I need to do first.

1559
02:05:05,665 --> 02:05:07,406
I'm not like Halliday.

1560
02:05:11,170 --> 02:05:13,207
I'm taking the leap.

1561
02:05:29,689 --> 02:05:30,896
We're looking for Wade Watts.

1562
02:05:32,817 --> 02:05:34,900
We need you to make a statement
about the clip you sent in

1563
02:05:35,069 --> 02:05:36,981
of Nolan Sorrento's confession.

1564
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,363
Uh, that was me.

1565
02:05:40,033 --> 02:05:42,571
What? I record everything
in my workshop.

1566
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,866
Help me out of this.

1567
02:05:57,216 --> 02:05:58,502
Who are you guys?

1568
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:03,800
The people you need right now, lawyers.
From Gregarious Games.

1569
02:06:06,642 --> 02:06:08,258
They want your signature, Wade.

1570
02:06:16,235 --> 02:06:18,318
I'm splitting it with my clan.

1571
02:06:18,488 --> 02:06:20,275
We're gonna run things together.

1572
02:06:24,827 --> 02:06:26,864
That's a good choice.

1573
02:06:54,816 --> 02:06:57,854
F'Nale, listen to me very carefully.

1574
02:07:07,078 --> 02:07:09,821
Mr. Morrow... I mean, Og,

1575
02:07:09,997 --> 02:07:11,283
how'd you get here so fast?

1576
02:07:11,457 --> 02:07:13,619
I flew from the stars
on my magic sleigh.

1577
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:16,623
Everyone's been watching.

1578
02:07:16,796 --> 02:07:20,005
Of course, I've been watching
a little closer than most.

1579
02:07:24,053 --> 02:07:25,464
You?

1580
02:07:25,972 --> 02:07:27,179
You're the Curator?

1581
02:07:30,935 --> 02:07:33,143
Well played, Parzival.

1582
02:07:34,397 --> 02:07:36,263
Jim told me nothing about the contest,

1583
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:39,649
so there was no rule
about me losing a bet to a smart kid.

1584
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:41,481
Not that you needed my help.

1585
02:07:42,446 --> 02:07:46,406
You figured out that Kira was the key
on your own.

1586
02:07:46,784 --> 02:07:49,401
Yeah, but... Kira wasn't the key.

1587
02:07:50,746 --> 02:07:52,612
It was you, Mr. Morrow.

1588
02:07:54,750 --> 02:07:56,412
You were the Rosebud.

1589
02:07:56,586 --> 02:07:58,794
And Halliday's biggest regret was

1590
02:08:00,506 --> 02:08:02,088
losing his only friend.

1591
02:08:06,345 --> 02:08:08,507
You know, Jim used to say the OASIS

1592
02:08:08,681 --> 02:08:11,139
was never supposed to be
a one-player game.

1593
02:08:14,854 --> 02:08:17,471
Now, who do we have here?

1594
02:08:17,648 --> 02:08:20,140
Oh. Well, look who it is.

1595
02:08:20,318 --> 02:08:21,900
It's my heroes, the High Five.

1596
02:08:22,069 --> 02:08:23,560
- You must be Art3mis.
- Samantha.

1597
02:08:23,738 --> 02:08:25,525
<i>The High Five took over the OASIS,</i>

1598
02:08:25,698 --> 02:08:27,155
<i>and the first thing we did</i>

1599
02:08:27,325 --> 02:08:30,659
<i>was sign Ogden Morrow
to a non-exclusive consultancy.</i>

1600
02:08:30,828 --> 02:08:33,662
<i>The salary, per his demand,</i>

1601
02:08:33,831 --> 02:08:36,915
<i>was 25 cents. One quarter.</i>

1602
02:08:40,296 --> 02:08:42,538
<i>With his guidance,
our second move was to ban</i>

1603
02:08:42,715 --> 02:08:45,378
<i>any loyalty centers
from accessing the OASIS.</i>

1604
02:08:46,177 --> 02:08:49,591
<i>IOI had no choice.
They shut 'em all down.</i>

1605
02:08:52,391 --> 02:08:54,849
<i>The third thing we did
wasn't as popular.</i>

1606
02:08:55,394 --> 02:08:58,512
<i>We closed the OASIS
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</i>

1607
02:08:59,398 --> 02:09:01,731
<i>I know, it sounds like a weird move,</i>

1608
02:09:01,901 --> 02:09:04,769
<i>but people need to spend
more time in the real world.</i>

1609
02:09:06,447 --> 02:09:09,360
<i>'Cause, like Halliday said,</i>

1610
02:09:09,533 --> 02:09:13,868
<i>reality is the only thing that's real.</i>
