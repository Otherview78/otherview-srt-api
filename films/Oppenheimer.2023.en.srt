1
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,024
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,860
Dr. Oppenheimer.

3
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:04,965
As we begin, I believe you have a statement to read into the record.

4
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:07,834
Yes, Your Honor.

5
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:10,269
We're not judges, Doctor.

6
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,071
No.

7
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,507
Of course.

8
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,347
Members of the security board.

9
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:25,485
The so-called and derogatory information in your indictment of me

10
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,019
cannot be fairly understood,

11
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,023
except in the context of my life and my work.

12
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,494
How long did he testify?

13
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,929
Honestly, I forget.

14
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,232
The whole hearing took a month.

15
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,800
An ordeal.

16
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,737
I've only read the transcripts, but...

17
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,073
Who'd want to justify their whole life?

18
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,742
- You weren't there? - As chairman, I wasn't allowed to be.

19
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,445
Are they really going to ask about it?

20
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,280
It was years ago.

21
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,983
- Four years ago. - Five.

22
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,351
Oppenheimer still divides America.

23
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:01,387
The committee is gonna want to know where you stood.

24
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:05,158
Senator Thurmond asked me to say not to feel that you're on trial.

25
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,427
Aw. Funny, I didn't till you just said that.

26
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,562
Really, Mr. Strauss...

27
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,097
It's Admiral.

28
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,332
Admiral Strauss. This is a formality.

29
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,768
President Eisenhower has asked you to be in his cabinet.

30
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,637
Senate really has no choice but to confirm you.

31
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,972
And if they bring up Oppenheimer?

32
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,508
When they bring up Oppenheimer, you answer honestly.

33
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,744
No senator can deny you did your duty.

34
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,046
It'll be uncomfortable.

35
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,283
Who'd want to justify their whole life?

36
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:37,157
Why did you leave the United States?

37
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:42,395
I, uh... I wanted to study the new physics.

38
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,330
Was there nowhere here?

39
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,868
I thought Berkeley had the leading theoretical physics department.

40
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,436
Yes. Once I had built it.

41
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:51,938
But first I had to go to Europe.

42
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:55,474
I went to Cambridge to study under Patrick Blackett.

43
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,011
Were you happier there than in America?

44
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,213
- Happier? - Yes.

45
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,918
No.

46
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,120
No, I, uh...

47
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,925
I was homesick, um,

48
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,828
emotionally immature,

49
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:20,634
troubled by visions of a hidden universe.

50
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:33,814
Useless in the lab.

51
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,821
Christ, Oppenheimer.

52
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,256
Have you had any sleep?

53
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,359
Start again.

54
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,795
I need to go to the lecture, sir.

55
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,263
Why?

56
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,199
It's Niels Bohr.

57
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,303
I'd completely forgot.

58
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,539
All right. Let's go.

59
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,411
Oh, no, not you, Oppenheimer. You finish coating those plates.

60
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,788
Quantum physics is not a step forward.

61
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,692
It is a new way to understand reality.

62
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,393
Einstein's opened the door.

63
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:58,664
Now we are peering through, seeing a world inside our world.

64
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:03,703
A world of energy and paradox that not everyone can accept.

65
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,249
Yeah... Are you all right?

66
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,885
Niels, meet J. Robert Oppenheimer.

67
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,553
What's the J stand for?

68
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,188
Nothing, apparently.

69
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,357
You were at my lecture. You asked the only good question.

70
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,292
No one's denying his insight.

71
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,763
It's his laboratory work that leaves a little to be desired.

72
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,997
I heard you give the same lectu...

73
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,533
At Harvard, yes, and you asked the same question.

74
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,667
Why ask again?

75
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,137
Hadn't liked your answer.

76
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,906
- Did you like it better yesterday? - A lot.

77
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:18,911
You can lift the stone without being ready for the snake that's revealed.

78
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,080
Now it seems you're ready.

79
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,482
But you don't enjoy the lab?

80
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,352
So get out of Cambridge with its beakers and potions.

81
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:29,322
Go somewhere they'll let you think.

82
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,391
Where?

83
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,759
Göttingen.

84
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,728
- Born. - Born.

85
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,563
Get to Germany. Study under Max Born.

86
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,266
Learn the ways of theory.

87
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,368
I'll send word.

88
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,271
Wormhole.

89
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,273
How's your mathematics?

90
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,108
Not good enough for the physicist he wants to be.

91
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,243
Algebra's like sheet music.

92
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,646
The important thing isn't "can you read music?"

93
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,114
It's "can you hear it?"

94
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,851
Can you hear the music, Robert?

95
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,720
Yes, I can.

96
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,018
The senator from Wyoming.

97
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,119
Admiral Strauss,

98
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,787
I'm interested in your relationship with

99
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,522
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

100
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,358
You met him in 1947?

101
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,326
Correct.

102
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,828
You were commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission?

103
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:54,868
I was, but I actually met Robert in my capacity as board member

104
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,570
of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton,

105
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,806
because after the war he was world renowned

106
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,274
as the great man of physics,

107
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:06,446
and I was determined to get him to run the Institute.

108
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,824
Dr. Oppenheimer. An honor.

109
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:19,959
Mr. Strauss.

110
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,194
It's pronounced "straws."

111
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,629
Oh-ppenheimer, Oppenheimer.

112
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,699
Whatever way you say it, they know I'm Jewish.

113
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,902
I'm president of Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan.

114
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,438
"Straws" is just the Southern pronunciation.

115
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,773
Anyway, welcome to the Institute.

116
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,308
I think you could be very happy here.

117
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,410
Yes, well, you'll love the commute.

118
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,113
The position comes with that house for you and your wife,

119
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,282
and your... Is it two children?

120
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,316
Yes, two.

121
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,119
I'm a great admirer of your work.

122
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,421
And you're a physicist by training, Mr. Strauss?

123
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,557
I'm sorry, common room, four o'clock tea.

124
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:54,593
No, I'm not trained in physics or anything else.

125
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,761
I'm a self-made man.

126
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,163
Ah. I can relate to that. Really?

127
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,266
Yes, my father was one.

128
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:04,170
And this would be your office.

129
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,948
I'm told he's there most afternoons.

130
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,516
You know, I've always wondered

131
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:21,087
why you didn't involve him in the Manhattan Project.

132
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,090
Greatest scientific mind of our time.

133
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,026
Of his time.

134
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,228
Einstein published his Theory of Relativity

135
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,731
more than 40 years ago now.

136
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,734
But never embraced the quantum world it revealed.

137
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,337
"God doesn't play dice."

138
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,471
Precisely.

139
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,074
You never thought of studying physics formally, Mr. Strauss?

140
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,643
I had offers, but I chose to sell shoes.

141
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,981
Lewis Strauss was once a lowly shoe salesman.

142
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,884
No, just a shoe salesman.

143
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,388
I'd love to introduce you.

144
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,524
No need.

145
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,993
I have known him for years.

146
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:22,648
Albert.

147
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,054
What was that?

148
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,357
What did you say to him?

149
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,761
Oh, he's fine.

150
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:41,066
Mr. Strauss, there are things in my past you ought to be aware of.

151
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:44,770
Well, as chairman of the AEC, I have access to your security file.

152
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:45,838
I've read it.

153
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,740
You're not worried? No.

154
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,209
Why would I be worried after everything you've done for your country?

155
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,643
Well, times change, Mr. Strauss.

156
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,679
Well, the purpose of this institute

157
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,382
is to provide a haven for independent minds.

158
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,350
That's you.

159
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,919
You are the man for the job.

160
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,721
Well, then I'll consider it.

161
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,258
I'll see you at the AEC meeting tomorrow.

162
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,364
This is one of the most prestigious appointments in the country.

163
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:15,167
Yes, with a great commute.

164
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,803
That's why I'm considering it.

165
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,305
So, Dr. Oppenheimer brought your attention to

166
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,007
his past associations

167
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,475
before you appointed him?

168
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,245
- Yes. - And they didn't concern you?

169
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,046
Just then I was entirely consumed

170
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,782
with what he must have said to Einstein

171
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,785
to sour him on me.

172
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,355
But later?

173
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,624
Well, we all know what happened later.

174
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,659
Doctor, your time in Europe,

175
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,394
you seemed to meet with a wide range

176
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,962
of other countries' physicists.

177
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,030
Yes, that's right.

178
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,100
Any Russians?

179
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,768
None that spring to mind.

180
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,804
If you'll just allow me to continue with my statement...

181
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:55,775
Mr. Robb, you'll have ample opportunity to cross-examine.

182
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:01,346
After Göttingen, I moved on to Leiden in Holland,

183
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,916
where I first met Isidor Rabi.

184
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,685
Excuse me.

185
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,391
A Yank, lecturing on the new physics?

186
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,859
This I have to hear.

187
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,994
I'm an American myself.

188
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,363
How surprising.

189
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,833
Let me know if you need any help with the English.

190
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,749
Wait, what's he saying?

191
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,494
No, thank you.

192
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,395
It's a long way to Zurich.

193
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,333
You get any skinnier, we're gonna lose you between the seat cushions.

194
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,033
I'm Rabi.

195
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,335
Oppenheimer.

196
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,370
I caught your lecture on molecules.

197
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,172
Caught some of it.

198
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,774
We're a couple of New York Jews. How do you know Dutch?

199
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,544
Well, I thought I'd better learn it when I got here this semester.

200
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:09,181
You learned enough Dutch in six weeks to give a lecture on quantum mechanics?

201
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,616
Wanted to challenge myself.

202
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:13,118
Quantum physics wasn't challenging enough.

203
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,853
Schvitzer. Schvitzer?

204
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,321
Show-off.

205
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,557
Dutch in six weeks, but you never learned Yiddish?

206
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,792
They don't speak it so much my side of the park.

207
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,395
Screw you.

208
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,565
- You homesick? - Oh, you know it.

209
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,868
Ever get the feeling our kind isn't entirely welcome here?

210
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,937
Physicists?

211
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,371
That's funny.

212
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,473
Not in the department.

213
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,875
They're all Jewish too.

214
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,245
Eat.

215
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,916
There's a German you have to seek out.

216
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,253
Heisenberg. Right.

217
00:14:56,296 --> 00:15:00,532
One might be led to the presumption that behind the quantum world,

218
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:04,236
there still hides a real world in which causality holds,

219
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:08,974
but such speculations seem to us, to say it explicitly, fruitless.

220
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,943
Thank you. Have a great day.

221
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,382
Werner. Wonderful. Thank you.

222
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,051
Dr. Oppenheimer.

223
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:23,088
Oppenheimer, yes. I liked your paper on molecules.

224
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,489
Probably because you inspired it.

225
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,191
If I inspire anything else, let me know.

226
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,259
We could publish together.

227
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,027
I have to get back to America.

228
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,662
Why?

229
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,031
There's no one there taking quantum mechanics seriously.

230
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,566
That's exactly why.

231
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,169
He's pining for the canyons of Manhattan.

232
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,471
Canyons of New Mexico.

233
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:40,639
You're from New Mexico?

234
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,374
No. New York, but my brother and I

235
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,876
have a ranch outside Santa Fe.

236
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,712
That's the America I miss right now.

237
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:49,082
Then it's best you get home, cowboys.

238
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,450
That's him.

239
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,787
No, me and horses? I don't think so.

240
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,756
Nice to meet you.

241
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,659
Did you ever encounter Heisenberg again?

242
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,396
Not in person, no, but, uh...

243
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:07,266
you might say our paths crossed.

244
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,901
On returning to America,

245
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:13,072
I accepted positions at both Caltech and up at Berkeley.

246
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,465
Dr. Lawrence, I presume?

247
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,735
- You must be Oppenheimer. - Yes.

248
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,204
I hear you want to start a school of quantum theory.

249
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,073
I am starting it. Next door.

250
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,274
They put you in there?

251
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,575
I asked for it.

252
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,544
Wanted to be close to you experimentalists.

253
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,146
Theory will get you only so far, huh?

254
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:56,348
We're building a machine to accelerate electrons.

255
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,416
Magnificent.

256
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,017
Would you like to help?

257
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,819
Build it? Oh, no.

258
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,187
No, no.

259
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,623
But I am working on theories I'd like to test with it.

260
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:05,857
When do you start teaching?

261
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,426
I've got my first in an hour.

262
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,662
- Seminar? - Pupil.

263
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,798
One student? That's it?

264
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,200
I'm teaching something no one here has dreamt of.

265
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,536
But once people start hearing what you can do with it...

266
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,172
There's no going back.

267
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,176
- Oh. I must have missed the... - Mr. Lomanitz?

268
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,445
Nah...

269
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,747
Yeah.

270
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:30,817
Yes, this is it. Please. Take a seat.

271
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,757
What do you know about quantum mechanics?

272
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,559
I have a grasp on the basics.

273
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,794
Then you're doing it wrong.

274
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,030
Is light made up of particles or waves?

275
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,766
Quantum mechanics says it's both. How could it be both?

276
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,102
- It can't. - It can't.

277
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,369
But it is.

278
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,874
It's paradoxical, and yet, it works.

279
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:02,982
Now...

280
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,885
Thank you.

281
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,286
Mr. Lomanitz.

282
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,554
You're gonna be okay.

283
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,256
Mr. Snyder.

284
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,391
Now let's consider a star.

285
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,860
A star.

286
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,928
A vast furnace burning in outer space,

287
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,564
fire pushing outwards against its own gravity.

288
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:20,967
Balanced.

289
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:23,669
But if that furnace cools

290
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:27,572
and gravity starts winning, it contracts.

291
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,707
Density increases.

292
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,476
Correct. Increasing gravity.

293
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,145
- Increasing density. - And?

294
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:36,982
It's a vicious cycle until... What's the limit here?

295
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:40,085
I don't know. See where the math takes us.

296
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,953
I guarantee it's somewhere no one's been before.

297
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,889
Me?

298
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,058
Yes, you. Your math is better than mine.

299
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,628
Dr. Oppenheimer's file

300
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,230
contained details of his activities in Berkeley.

301
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,100
Why would they have started a file on Dr. Oppenheimer

302
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,768
before the war?

303
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,337
Well, you'd have to ask Mr. Hoover.

304
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,240
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.

305
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,675
Uh, my assumption is

306
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:08,714
that it was connected to his, uh, left-wing political activities.

307
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,086
You shouldn't let them bring up politics in the classroom, Oppie.

308
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,887
I wrote that.

309
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,957
Lawrence, you embrace the revolution in physics.

310
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,992
Can't you see it everywhere else?

311
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,128
Picasso, Stravinsky, Freud, Marx.

312
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:26,265
Well, this is America, Oppie. We had our revolution.

313
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,801
Seriously, keep it out of the lab.

314
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:34,639
Well, out of the lab, my landlady is having a discussion group tonight.

315
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,974
Interested?

316
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,076
I have sampled the Berkeley political scene.

317
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:42,414
It's all just philosophy postgrads and communists talking integration.

318
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:43,949
You don't care about integration?

319
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,817
I want to vote for it, not talk about it.

320
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,285
Especially on a Friday.

321
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,386
Come on. Let's eat.

322
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,355
I'm meeting my brother there.

323
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:54,426
And how would these activities have come to the attention of the FBI?

324
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,294
Well, if I remember correctly,

325
00:19:56,295 --> 00:20:00,632
the FBI was taking license plates outside suspected communist gatherings,

326
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,635
and his name popped up.

327
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,444
Jesus Christ. Sorry.

328
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,180
Frank. Robert.

329
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,881
Uh, you remember Jackie.

330
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,950
Evening.

331
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:19,885
Let's go.

332
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,024
Robert.

333
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:27,325
I want you to meet Chevalier.

334
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,629
Dr. Haakon Chevalier, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

335
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,963
Pleasure. Pleasure.

336
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,732
This is my little brother, Frank. Hello.

337
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,433
- And this is... - Still Jackie.

338
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,601
Hello, Still Jackie.

339
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,570
Chevalier, you're in languages?

340
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,372
And your reputation precedes you.

341
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:41,973
What have you heard?

342
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,675
That you're teaching a radical new approach to physics

343
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,110
I have no chance of understanding,

344
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,978
but I hadn't heard you're a Party member.

345
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,713
- I'm not. - Not yet.

346
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,249
Frank and I are thinking of joining. Just the other day, I was...

347
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,584
I support a range of causes.

348
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,486
The Spanish Civil War?

349
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,855
A democratic republic being overthrown by fascist thugs, who wouldn't?

350
00:20:56,856 --> 00:21:00,925
Our government. They think that socialism is a bigger threat than fascism.

351
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,762
Not for long. Look at what the Nazis are doing to the Jews.

352
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,464
I send funds to colleagues in Germany to emigrate.

353
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,234
I have to do something.

354
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,636
My own work is so abstract.

355
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:15,507
What are you working on? What happens to stars when they die.

356
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:16,776
Do stars die?

357
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:21,279
Well, if they do, they cool, then collapse.

358
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,319
In fact, the bigger the star, the more violent its demise.

359
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:30,689
Their gravity gets so concentrated, it swallows everything.

360
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,357
Everything, even light.

361
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,625
Can that really happen?

362
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,427
The math says it can.

363
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:38,530
If we can get published, then perhaps one day an astronomer finds one.

364
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,165
But right now, all I have is theory,

365
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,233
which can't impact people's lives.

366
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,536
Well, if you're going to send money to Spain,

367
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:46,237
do it through the Communist Party.

368
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,675
- They can get it to the front lines. - Mary sent me with these.

369
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,644
I'm Jean.

370
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:53,378
Robert.

371
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:54,746
Haakon Chevalier.

372
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,481
The union meeting at Serber's last month.

373
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,782
Right, right, yes.

374
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,284
Oh, thank you.

375
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,386
Robert here says he's not a communist.

376
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:03,755
Well, then he doesn't know enough about it.

377
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:06,358
I've read Das Kapital, all three volumes.

378
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:09,661
- Does that count? - It would make you better read than most party members.

379
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:13,565
It's turgid stuff. There's some thinking, "Ownership is theft."

380
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:14,833
"Property."

381
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,268
"Property"? "Property," not "ownership."

382
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,372
I'm sorry, I read it in the original German.

383
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,640
Well...

384
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,810
It's not about the book. It's about the ideas.

385
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,545
And you sound uncommitted.

386
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:31,516
I'm committed to thinking freely about how to improve our world.

387
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,451
Why limit yourself to one dogma?

388
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,421
You're a physicist. You pick and choose rules?

389
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:40,792
Or do you use the discipline to channel your energies into progress?

390
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,928
I like a little wiggle room.

391
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,965
Do you always toe the party line?

392
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,301
I like my wiggle room too.

393
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,679
What?

394
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,015
Wait, wait, wait.

395
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,621
- Unexpected. - What?

396
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,022
For a physicist.

397
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:13,458
You only have a shelf full of Freud?

398
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:16,261
Well, actually, my background's more...

399
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:17,463
Jungian?

400
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,032
You know analysis?

401
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,270
When I was a postgrad at Cambridge, I had a little trouble.

402
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:26,404
I'll bite.

403
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,906
I tried to poison my tutor.

404
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:28,973
Did you hate him?

405
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,575
I liked him very much.

406
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,477
You just needed to get laid.

407
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:34,012
Took my analyst two years,

408
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,980
and I don't think they ever put it that succinctly.

409
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:40,018
You have everyone convinced you're more complicated than you actually are.

410
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,153
We're all simple souls, I guess.

411
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,389
I'm not.

412
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,292
What's this?

413
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,827
Sanskrit.

414
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:50,028
You can read this?

415
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,964
I'm learning.

416
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:57,970
Read this.

417
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:03,374
Well, in this part, Vishnu reveals his multi-armed self...

418
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,510
No.

419
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,313
Read the words.

420
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,219
"And now I am become Death."

421
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,026
"The destroyer of worlds."

422
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,892
This'll do.

423
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,999
It'll break before dawn.

424
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,570
Air cools overnight. Just before dawn, it breaks.

425
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,240
Come on. Come on.

426
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,115
So...

427
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:18,483
I'm getting married.

428
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,919
- Frank. Congratulations. - Thank you.

429
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,053
To Jackie?

430
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,622
Yeah, to Jackie.

431
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,090
The waitress.

432
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,492
Oppie, you're right. It's lettin' up.

433
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,427
I'm gonna go see if there's any stars.

434
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:32,063
All your talk about the common man,

435
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:34,566
but Jackie's not good enough for you, hmm?

436
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:37,135
We join the Party, and you can't hide your disapproval, why?

437
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:39,170
Is that because that's supposed to be your thing?

438
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,872
I haven't joined the Party, Frank.

439
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,308
And I don't think she should have convinced you to either.

440
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:45,009
Half of the faculty is communist.

441
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,278
Not that half.

442
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:50,248
I'm your brother, Frank, and I want you to be cautious.

443
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,318
And I want to wring your neck.

444
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,456
I won't live my life afraid to make a mistake.

445
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:02,327
You're happy, I'm happy.

446
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:05,397
So then I'm happy you're happy that I'm happy.

447
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:13,471
I feel like I could see one of those dark stars that you're working on.

448
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:16,641
You can't. That's the whole point.

449
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:18,677
Their gravity swallows light.

450
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:22,081
It's like a kind of hole in space.

451
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,048
Is Frank okay?

452
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,052
Yes. He just has a shitty brother.

453
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,321
It is special here.

454
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,192
When I was a kid,

455
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:36,228
I thought if I could find a way

456
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:41,666
to combine physics and New Mexico,

457
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,469
my life would be perfect.

458
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,805
Little remote for that. Yes.

459
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,074
Let's get some sleep.

460
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:54,346
That mesa we saw today, one of my favorite places in the world.

461
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,748
Tomorrow we'll climb it.

462
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,283
What's it called?

463
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,120
Los Alamos.

464
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:06,392
I didn't expect to see you today.

465
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,495
Do I have to make an appointment?

466
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:14,133
- Hey! Hey, get back here! - Alvarez?

467
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:23,107
Oppie! Oppie!

468
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,109
What? What is it?

469
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,778
They've done it. They've done it.

470
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:30,149
Hahn and Strassmann in Germany. They split the uranium nucleus.

471
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,718
How?

472
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:35,586
Bombarded it with neutrons.

473
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,589
It's a nuclear fission. They did it, they split the atom.

474
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,092
It's not possible.

475
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,133
I'm gonna try to reproduce it.

476
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,708
See? Can't be done.

477
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,278
Very elegant.

478
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,112
Quite clear.

479
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,449
There's just one problem. Where?

480
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,217
Next door.

481
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:07,186
Alvarez did it.

482
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:09,654
But then look,

483
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:12,890
these fission pulses, they're massive.

484
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:16,494
I've seen 30 of these in the past ten minutes.

485
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,364
Theory will take you only so far.

486
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:23,167
During the process,

487
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:27,739
extra neutrons boil off, which could be used to split other uranium atoms.

488
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,875
Chain reaction. You're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

489
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,911
You, me and every other physicist around the world

490
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,980
who's seen the news.

491
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,050
What? What are we all thinking?

492
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:41,587
A bomb, Alvarez.

493
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:44,156
A bomb.

494
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,559
I told you, Robert, no more fucking flowers.

495
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:52,598
I don't understand what you want from me. I don't want anything from you.

496
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:57,736
Well, you say that and then you call. Well, don't answer.

497
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,372
I'll always answer.

498
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:08,580
Fine. Just no more flowers.

499
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,683
You're not coming?

500
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,721
You have to know when you're beaten, Robert.

501
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,690
It's not that simple, Hoke.

502
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,059
- Chevalier, good to see you. - F-A-E-C-T! F-A-E-C-T!

503
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,596
Barbara, good to see you, and the illustrious Dr. Oppenheimer.

504
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,598
I'm Eltenton. Pleasure.

505
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,066
Please, please.

506
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,403
Might you say a word about organized labor on campuses, yes?

507
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,005
Coming through! Coming through.

508
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,506
I work at Shell.

509
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,608
We've signed up chemists, we signed up engineers,

510
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,477
so why not scientists in academia?

511
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:44,516
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

512
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:55,593
Teachers are unionized.

513
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:58,362
- Why not professors? - Don't you have somewhere to be?

514
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,065
Lawrence, academics have rights too.

515
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,234
Look, it's not that. I've got a group coming.

516
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:05,169
Oh. I'll sit in.

517
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,471
Not this one.

518
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:16,515
Richard. Dr. Bush. What brings you two up north?

519
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:28,694
Richard, you tell Ruth I'll be down to Pasadena Thursday.

520
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,872
Your paper on black holes is in!

521
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,275
Where's Hartland?

522
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,210
Get Hartland. Get Hartland.

523
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:50,182
September 1st, 1939. The world's gonna remember this day.

524
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,584
Oh, Hartland. Our paper, it's in print.

525
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,754
We've been upstaged.

526
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:00,591
During the Battle of Britain,

527
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,594
I found myself increasingly out of sympathy

528
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:07,765
with the policy of neutrality that communists advocated.

529
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:10,902
But after Hitler invaded Russia and we became allies,

530
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:13,638
these communist sympathies, did they return?

531
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:15,072
No.

532
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:19,277
I need to make clear that my changing views on Russia

533
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,847
did not mean a sharp break from those who held different views.

534
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:25,349
For a year or two, and during a previous marriage,

535
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,787
my wife Kitty had been a Communist Party member.

536
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,725
This way. This is where I keep the good stuff.

537
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,627
I thought this was the Tolmans' house.

538
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,629
I live with them while I'm at Caltech.

539
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,833
- Do you two need anything? - We're good, Ruthie.

540
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,603
So, you're a biologist.

541
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:48,839
Well, somehow I have graduated to housewife.

542
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,177
Can you explain quantum mechanics to me? Seems baffling.

543
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,846
Yes, it is.

544
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:59,718
Well, this glass, this drink,

545
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:04,556
this countertop, uh, our bodies,

546
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:07,326
all of it.

547
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:10,394
It's mostly empty space.

548
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:13,731
Groupings of tiny energy waves bound together.

549
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:14,966
By what?

550
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:18,235
Forces of attraction strong enough to convince us

551
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:23,275
that matter is solid, stop my body passing through yours.

552
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,489
You're married to Dr. Harrison.

553
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:38,924
Not very.

554
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:44,662
There is someone that I feel...

555
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,197
Does she feel the same way?

556
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,766
Sometimes.

557
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,001
Not enough.

558
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:53,938
You know, I'm going to New Mexico.

559
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:57,275
To my ranch, with friends. You should come.

560
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,277
I meant with your husband.

561
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,512
Yes, you did.

562
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:02,580
'Cause you know it won't make

563
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:04,750
a bit of difference.

564
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,121
Why did you marry him?

565
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:13,525
I was lost and he was kind.

566
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:16,728
Lost?

567
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:18,929
Well, my previous husband had died,

568
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,333
and at 28 I wasn't really ready to be a widow.

569
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,768
Who was your first husband?

570
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:27,171
Nobody. But my second husband was Joe Dallet.

571
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,573
He was, um, from money, like me,

572
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:33,244
but he was a union organizer in Youngstown, Ohio.

573
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:34,412
Fell hard.

574
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:35,846
How hard?

575
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,415
Hard enough to spend the next four years

576
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:38,849
living off beans and pancakes,

577
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,619
handing out the Daily Worker at factory gates.

578
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,522
By 36, I just told Joe I couldn't take it anymore.

579
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,191
Quit the Party. A year later, I wanted him back.

580
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,660
Him, not the Daily Worker.

581
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,862
He said, "Swell, I'll meet you on my way to Spain."

582
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,597
He went to fight for the Loyalists?

583
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,735
And then he went to the brigades and I waited, and...

584
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:02,373
Joe got himself killed first time he popped his head outta the trench.

585
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,742
Ideology got Joe killed. For nothing.

586
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:06,444
Spanish Republic isn't nothing.

587
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:09,713
My husband offered both our futures to stop one fascist bullet

588
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,117
from embedding itself in a mudbank.

589
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:15,352
That's the definition of nothing.

590
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,522
Seems a little reductive. Pragmatic.

591
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:20,792
Now here I am.

592
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,764
Wherever the hell this is.

593
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,739
I didn't want you to hear it from anyone else.

594
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,478
Least you didn't bring me flowers.

595
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,688
We both know I'm not what you want, Jean.

596
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,891
Yeah, but it's a door closing.

597
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,659
No.

598
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:58,597
Not as far as I'm concerned, no.

599
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:02,166
You knocked her up. Fast work.

600
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:05,102
Can't keep a good man down.

601
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,537
I meant her.

602
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:10,407
She knew what she wanted. What about the husband?

603
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,809
We talked.

604
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,210
They're getting a divorce

605
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:17,481
so we can get married before she starts showing.

606
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,150
How civilized.

607
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:23,954
You idiot. This is your community.

608
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,325
You think the rules don't apply to the golden boy?

609
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:30,194
Brilliance makes up for a lot.

610
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:34,432
Don't alienate the only people in the world that understand what you do.

611
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,168
One day you might need them.

612
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:39,870
F-A-E-C-T! F-A-E-C-T!

613
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,139
The Federation of Architects, Engineers,

614
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,509
Chemists and Technicians.

615
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:54,318
- Lomanitz, what do you get paid a month? - That's not the point, Lawrence.

616
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:59,357
What do any of you have in common with farm laborers and dock workers?

617
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,892
Plenty.

618
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:04,062
Everybody out. Now!

619
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,801
Not you.

620
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,308
What are you doing?

621
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:20,444
It's a trade union. Filled with communists.

622
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:22,279
So? I haven't joined the Party.

623
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,849
They won't let me bring you onto the project because of this shit.

624
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,219
They won't even let me tell you what the project is.

625
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,121
Oh, I know what the project is. Oh, really?

626
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,891
We've all heard about Einstein and Szilard's letter to Roosevelt

627
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,459
warning him the Germans could make a bomb,

628
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,163
and I know what it means for the Nazis to have a bomb.

629
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,531
And I don't?

630
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,634
It's not your people they're herding into camps.

631
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:45,336
It's mine.

632
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:48,073
You think that I tell them about your politics.

633
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,709
The next time you're coming home from a meeting,

634
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,577
why don't you take a look in the rearview mirror?

635
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:58,616
Listen to the sounds on your phone line and stop being so goddamn naive.

636
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,585
Why would they care what I do?

637
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,821
Because you're not just self-important,

638
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,991
you're actually important.

639
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:10,528
Okay.

640
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:14,498
I get it. If you could just be a little more...

641
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,000
Pragmatic.

642
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:17,735
I'll talk to Lomanitz, I'll talk to the others.

643
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,905
You don't have to worry. It's done, Lawrence.

644
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:27,811
Then welcome to the war.

645
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,114
I filled out my first security questionnaire

646
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:33,350
and was informed that my involvement with left-wing groups

647
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:37,354
would not prove a bar to my working on the atomic program.

648
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,090
Why were his communist associations

649
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,027
not seen as a security risk during the war?

650
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:46,163
Senator, I can't possibly answer for security clearance

651
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:48,432
granted years before I ever met the man.

652
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,401
Fine. What about after?

653
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:52,202
After the war,

654
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:56,106
Dr. Oppenheimer was the most respected scientific voice in the world.

655
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,208
That's why I asked him to run the Institute.

656
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:01,378
That's why he advised the Atomic Energy Commission.

657
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,546
Simple as that.

658
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:05,082
What are they accusing me of?

659
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:08,552
I think they just wanna know what happened between 1947 and 1954

660
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:11,588
to change your mind on Oppenheimer's security clearance.

661
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:12,656
I didn't.

662
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,325
I was chair of the AEC,

663
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:17,628
but it wasn't me that brought the charges against Robert.

664
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,263
Who did?

665
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:21,098
Some former staff member of the Joint Congressional Committee.

666
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:24,234
He was a rabid anti-communist named Borden.

667
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,670
He wrote to the FBI demanding they take action.

668
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:29,139
The FBI? Why not go to the AEC direct?

669
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,809
Why get caught holding the knife yourself?

670
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,711
What did Borden have against Oppenheimer?

671
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:36,180
This was the McCarthy Era.

672
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:39,483
People hounded out of jobs for any hint of red.

673
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,553
And then, reading Oppenheimer's security file,

674
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:45,823
his communist brother, sister-in-law, fiancée,

675
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,358
best friend, wife.

676
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,560
That's before we even get to the Chevalier incident.

677
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:53,097
But how would Borden have access to Oppenheimer's security file?

678
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,300
Because somebody gave it to him.

679
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,736
Somebody who wanted Robert silenced.

680
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:00,604
Who? Who knows?

681
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:05,309
Robert didn't take care not to upset the power brokers in Washington.

682
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,178
His opinions on the atom became definitive

683
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,049
and he wasn't always patient with us mere mortals.

684
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,820
I came in for plenty of harsh treatment.

685
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:20,190
There was an AEC vote

686
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,626
on the export of isotopes to Norway,

687
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:25,596
and they drafted in Robert to make me look like a fool.

688
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:26,930
But, Dr. Oppenheimer,

689
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,399
we've already heard from Admiral Strauss

690
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,869
that these isotopes could be useful to our enemies

691
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,537
in the production of atomic weapons.

692
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,473
Congressmen, you could use a shovel in making atomic weapons.

693
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,008
In fact, you do.

694
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:40,844
You could use a bottle of beer in making atomic weapons.

695
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,413
In fact, you do.

696
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:45,616
I say isotopes are less useful than electronic components,

697
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:49,154
but more useful than a sandwich.

698
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:53,258
Genius is no guarantee of wisdom.

699
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,995
How could this man who saw so much be so blind?

700
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:07,839
Kitty?

701
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:13,978
Kitty?

702
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,849
Kitty, the project...

703
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,685
I'm in. I'm in.

704
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:23,188
Let's celebrate.

705
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,795
Shouldn't you go to him?

706
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:38,803
I have been going to him all fucking day.

707
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,418
Okay.

708
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:02,392
Here.

709
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,528
Come here, darling.

710
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,630
I don't know how to say this.

711
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,032
I-I'm ashamed to ask.

712
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,301
Anything.

713
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,003
- Take Peter. - Sure.

714
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:15,139
No, for a while, Hoke.

715
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:17,108
A while.

716
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,044
Does Kitty know you're here?

717
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:23,080
Yes, of course she knows.

718
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:25,315
Of course she knows.

719
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,253
We're awful people. Selfish, awful people.

720
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:31,488
Forget I asked.

721
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,290
Selfish, awful people,

722
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:36,027
they don't know they're selfish and awful.

723
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:38,263
Sit, sit, sit.

724
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:43,568
Robert, you see beyond the world we live in.

725
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,804
There is a price to be paid for that.

726
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,407
Of course we'll help you.

727
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,586
Everything's changing, Robert.

728
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:04,354
Having a child was always going to change...

729
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:08,259
No, the world, it's pivoting in some new direction.

730
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,561
It's reforming.

731
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,565
This is your moment.

732
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,200
We're putting together a group to study feasibili...

733
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,271
"We" shouldn't be doing anything. You should.

734
00:42:20,939 --> 00:42:23,073
Lawrence won't get this done.

735
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:25,576
Or Tolman, or Rabi. You will.

736
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:36,454
Who are the uniforms?

737
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:38,856
I thought you might know.

738
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:42,026
Dr. Oppenheimer.

739
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:44,394
I'm Colonel Groves.

740
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,763
This is Lieutenant Colonel Nichols.

741
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,232
Have that dry cleaned.

742
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:56,106
Well, if that's how you treat Lieutenant Colonel,

743
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:59,610
I'd hate to see how you treat a humble physicist.

744
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:01,712
If I ever meet one, I'll let you know.

745
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:03,113
Ouch.

746
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:04,915
Theaters of combat all over the world,

747
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,250
but I have to stay in Washington.

748
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,286
- Why? - I built the Pentagon.

749
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:14,292
The brass likes it so much they made me take over the Manhattan Engineer District.

750
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:15,693
Which is?

751
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:17,728
Don't be a smart ass.

752
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:19,396
You know damn well what it is.

753
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:21,665
You and half of every physics department across the country.

754
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,433
That's problem number one.

755
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,503
I thought problem number one would be securing enough uranium ore.

756
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:30,207
- 1,200 tons bought the day I took charge. - Processing?

757
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:32,643
Just broke ground at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

758
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:35,580
Now I'm looking for a project director.

759
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:37,714
And my name came up?

760
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,583
Nope.

761
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:42,152
Even though you brought quantum physics to America.

762
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:45,423
- Which made me curious. - What've you found out?

763
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,692
You're a dilettante, a womanizer,

764
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:50,193
a suspected communist...

765
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,695
I'm a New Deal Democrat.

766
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:53,296
I said "suspected."

767
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:57,401
Unstable, theatrical, egotistical, neurotic...

768
00:43:57,402 --> 00:44:00,337
Nothing good, no? Not even, "He's brilliant, but..."

769
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:03,707
Well, brilliance is taken for granted in your circle, so no.

770
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:07,511
No, the only person who had anything good to say was Richard Tolman.

771
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:09,579
Tolman thinks you have integrity,

772
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:14,285
but he also strikes me as a guy who knows more about science than people.

773
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:16,420
Yet here you are.

774
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:18,121
You don't take much on trust.

775
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,124
I don't take anything on trust.

776
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:25,562
Why don't you have a Nobel prize?

777
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:27,931
- Why aren't you a general? - They're making me one for this.

778
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:29,132
Perhaps I'll have the same luck.

779
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,967
A Nobel prize for making a bomb?

780
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:33,137
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

781
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:37,208
So how would you proceed?

782
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:43,714
You're talking about turning theory into a practical weapons system

783
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:45,015
faster than the Nazis.

784
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,483
Who have a 12-month head start.

785
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:48,618
- Eighteen. - How could you possibly know that?

786
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,254
Our fast neutron research took six months.

787
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:52,856
The man they've undoubtedly put in charge

788
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,491
will have made that leap instantly.

789
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:56,693
- Who do you think they put in charge? - Werner Heisenberg.

790
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,996
He has the most intuitive understanding of atomic structure

791
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,131
I have ever seen.

792
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:02,733
- You know his work? - I know him.

793
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:05,335
Just like I know Walther Bothe, Von Weizsäcker, Diebner.

794
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:07,204
In a straight race, the Germans win.

795
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,538
We've got one hope.

796
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,774
Which is?

797
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:12,276
Anti-Semitism.

798
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:14,445
What?

799
00:45:14,446 --> 00:45:16,313
Hitler called quantum physics

800
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:17,547
"Jewish science."

801
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,249
Said it right to Einstein's face.

802
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:22,552
Our one hope is that Hitler is so, so blinded by hate

803
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,354
that he's denied Heisenberg proper resources,

804
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:26,289
because it'll take vast resources.

805
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,991
Our nation's best scientists, working together.

806
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:29,192
Right now, they're scattered.

807
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,894
Which gives us compartmentalization.

808
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:34,097
All minds have to see the whole task to contribute efficiently.

809
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:36,299
Poor security may cost us the race.

810
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,368
Inefficiency will.

811
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:40,203
The Germans know more than us anyway.

812
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,039
The Russians don't.

813
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:46,143
Remind me, who are we at war with?

814
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:49,613
Somebody with your past doesn't wanna be seen downplaying

815
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:53,384
the importance of security from our communist allies.

816
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,453
Point taken. But, no.

817
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:58,054
You don't get to say "no" to me.

818
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:00,390
It's my job to say "no" to you when you're wrong.

819
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,425
So you have the job now?

820
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,695
Uh, I'm considering it.

821
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:10,134
I'm starting to see where you got your reputation.

822
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:13,270
My favorite response?

823
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,806
"Oppenheimer couldn't run a hamburger stand."

824
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:18,709
I couldn't.

825
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:22,747
But I can run the Manhattan Project.

826
00:46:23,548 --> 00:46:25,849
There's a way to balance these things.

827
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:30,120
Keep the Rad Lab here at Berkeley under Lawrence.

828
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,255
Met Lab in Chicago under Szilard.

829
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:34,825
Large scale refining, where did you say? Tennessee.

830
00:46:34,826 --> 00:46:36,426
And Hanford. And Hanford.

831
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:39,963
All America's industrial might and scientific innovation,

832
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,098
connected by rail.

833
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,633
Focused on one goal.

834
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,403
One point in space and time. And it comes together here.

835
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:47,971
A secret laboratory.

836
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:50,207
In the middle of nowhere, secure, self-sufficient,

837
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:51,741
equipment, housing, the works.

838
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:54,010
Keep everyone there until it's done.

839
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:56,613
- I'll need the schools, stores, a church. - Why?

840
00:46:56,614 --> 00:47:00,183
If we don't let scientists bring their families, we'll never get the best.

841
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:03,053
You want security, build a town, build it fast.

842
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:04,622
Where?

843
00:47:08,226 --> 00:47:09,926
Welcome to Los Alamos.

844
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:12,462
Now, there's a boys' school we'll have to commandeer

845
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:14,464
and the local Indians come up here for burial rites.

846
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:16,199
But, apart from that, nothing.

847
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,601
Forty miles. Any direction.

848
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:19,769
Enough to find the perfect spot.

849
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,139
- What for? - Success.

850
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:29,480
Build him a town. Fast.

851
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,216
Let's go recruit some scientists.

852
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:35,118
Why would I leave my family?

853
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,987
I told you, you can bring your family.

854
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:38,355
I'm not a soldier, Oppie.

855
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,523
A soldier? He's a general.

856
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,325
I've got all the soldier I need.

857
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,361
What can I tell them?

858
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,363
Heisenberg, Diebner, Bothe, Bohr.

859
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:47,731
What do these men have in common?

860
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:49,766
The greatest minds on atomic theory.

861
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:51,234
Yes, and? Uh...

862
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,304
As much as you like,

863
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:56,773
until you feel my boot on your balls.

864
00:47:56,774 --> 00:47:58,408
You know isotopes

865
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,744
and you know explosives, better than anyone in the world.

866
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:02,680
But you can't tell us what you're doing.

867
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,652
I don't know. The Nazis have them.

868
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:10,820
Niels Bohr's in Copenhagen. Under Nazi occupation.

869
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:12,756
Did they stop printing newspapers in Princeton?

870
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:16,626
Why would we go to the middle of nowhere for who knows how long?

871
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,696
A year or two. Or three.

872
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:22,967
General, could you give us a moment?

873
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:27,271
It's about unleashing the strong force

874
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:30,274
before the Nazis do.

875
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,075
Oh, my God.

876
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,344
Niels won't work for the Nazis. No, never.

877
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:36,613
But while they have him, we don't.

878
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:37,814
That's why I need you.

879
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:40,016
Why would you think I'd do that?

880
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,818
Why? Why?

881
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:43,987
How about because this is the most important fucking thing

882
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:46,289
to ever happen in the history of the world.

883
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,926
How about that? Fuck.

884
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,833
They are not gonna let me onto this project.

885
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:59,536
And failing a security check is not gonna be good for a career,

886
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:00,704
even after the war.

887
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:02,539
So you're a fellow traveler.

888
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,975
So what? This is a national emergency.

889
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:08,278
I've got some skeletons, they put me in charge.

890
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:09,346
They need us.

891
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:11,549
Until they don't.

892
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:17,220
Is there any chance of getting Bohr out of Denmark?

893
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:18,388
Nah, no dice.

894
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:20,590
I checked with the British.

895
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:22,625
Until we get Allied boots back onto the continent,

896
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,894
there's just no way.

897
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:26,997
Is he that important?

898
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:30,000
How many people do you know who've proved Einstein wrong?

899
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:33,370
You know, it really would be quicker to take a plane.

900
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:34,938
No, plane's too risky.

901
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:37,074
Country needs us.

902
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:43,514
The Harvard guys, they say the building's too small for the cyclotron.

903
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,718
Get them together with the architects.

904
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,957
When's this place supposed to open?

905
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,894
Two months.

906
00:49:57,895 --> 00:50:01,565
Robert, you're the great improviser, but this...

907
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,868
you can't do in your head.

908
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:06,570
Four divisions.

909
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:11,207
Experimental, Theoretical, Metallurgical, Ordnance.

910
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,342
Who's running Theoretical?

911
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:13,977
I am.

912
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:16,714
That's what I was afraid of. You're spread too thin.

913
00:50:17,982 --> 00:50:19,583
So you take Theoretical.

914
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:24,989
I'm not coming here, Robert.

915
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:32,730
Why not?

916
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:42,673
You drop a bomb, and it falls on the just and the unjust.

917
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:46,509
I don't wish the culmination of three centuries of physics

918
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,712
to be a weapon of mass destruction.

919
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,156
Izzy.

920
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:04,829
I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon.

921
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,467
But I know the Nazis can't.

922
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,738
We have no choice.

923
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,642
Then...

924
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:22,879
the second thing you'll have to do is appoint Hans Bethe

925
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,849
to run the theoretical division.

926
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:28,818
Wait, what was the first?

927
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:32,489
Take off that ridiculous uniform. You're a scientist.

928
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,557
Groves is insisting we join.

929
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,626
Tell Groves to go shit in his hat.

930
00:51:36,627 --> 00:51:38,728
They need us for who we are.

931
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:42,399
So be yourself. Only better.

932
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,173
This is the only key.

933
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:26,509
And Teller's already here. Shall I just show him in?

934
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,813
No, let's wait for the others.

935
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:37,521
Let's get started.

936
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:39,422
Hello, Edward.

937
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:40,557
Yes.

938
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:42,859
Gentlemen, so, we will work here

939
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,762
until the T-section at Los Alamos is finished.

940
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:46,829
Edward, can I please...

941
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,465
It is more important.

942
00:52:50,134 --> 00:52:52,101
When I calculated the chain reaction,

943
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:54,939
I found a rather troubling possibility.

944
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:58,675
No. This can't be right.

945
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,410
Show me how you did your calculations.

946
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:01,679
Yes.

947
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:08,752
It's exponential. No. No, no, no. No.

948
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:13,323
This is fantasy.

949
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:15,625
Teller's calculations can't be right.

950
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:18,494
Do them yourself while I go to Princeton.

951
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,363
What for? To talk to Einstein.

952
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,865
There's not much common ground between you two.

953
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,835
That's why I should get his view.

954
00:53:29,473 --> 00:53:31,474
- Albert. - Mmm?

955
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:34,210
Ah, Dr. Oppenheimer.

956
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:37,547
Well, have you met Dr. Gödel? We walk here most days.

957
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:41,951
Trees are the most inspiring structures.

958
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,921
Albert, might I have a word?

959
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:46,757
Of course. Excuse me, Kurt.

960
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:51,294
You know, some days, Kurt refuses to eat.

961
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:52,862
Even in Princeton.

962
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:56,000
He's convinced that the Nazis can poison his food.

963
00:53:57,268 --> 00:53:58,636
Hmm?

964
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:02,906
Wha...

965
00:54:07,378 --> 00:54:10,179
Whose... Whose work is this?

966
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,582
Teller's.

967
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,218
What do you take it to mean?

968
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,619
Neutrons smash into nucleus,

969
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:20,157
releasing neutrons to smash into other nuclei.

970
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:22,825
Criticality, a point of no return,

971
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,460
massive explosive force.

972
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:27,064
But this time, the chain reaction doesn't stop.

973
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:30,968
It would ignite the atmosphere.

974
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:33,903
When we detonate an atomic device,

975
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:36,240
we might start a chain reaction that...

976
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,043
destroys the world.

977
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:41,611
So here we are, hmm?

978
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:45,948
Lost in your quantum world of probabilities

979
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,850
and needing certainty.

980
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:50,486
Can you run the calculations yourself?

981
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:55,458
About the only thing you and I have in common is a disdain for mathematics.

982
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:58,861
Who's working on this in Berkeley? Hans Bethe.

983
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:01,331
Well, he'll get to the truth.

984
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:05,269
And if the truth is catastrophic?

985
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:07,136
Then you stop.

986
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,174
And you share your findings with the Nazis.

987
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:14,044
So neither side destroys the world.

988
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,348
Robert.

989
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:22,953
This is yours, not mine.

990
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,166
Teller's wrong.

991
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,303
He's wrong. Shh, shh, shh...

992
00:55:48,212 --> 00:55:50,813
When you know Teller's critical assumptions,

993
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,315
the real picture emerges.

994
00:55:52,316 --> 00:55:54,050
Bottom line?

995
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:57,320
The chances of an uncontrolled nuclear reaction are near zero.

996
00:55:57,321 --> 00:55:58,822
Near zero.

997
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:01,524
Oppie, this is good news.

998
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,493
Mmm.

999
00:56:03,494 --> 00:56:06,462
Can you run them again? No, you'll get the same answer.

1000
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:08,197
Till they actually detonate one of these things,

1001
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,833
the best assurance you're going to get is this.

1002
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:12,269
Near zero.

1003
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:17,974
Theory will take you only so far. Mmm.

1004
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:21,110
- Hello! - Hello, you. We missed him.

1005
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:23,579
You want to adopt? She's kidding.

1006
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,349
We wanted to see you before we left.

1007
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:28,318
For parts unknown.

1008
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,356
You know who I ran into the other day? Eltenton.

1009
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:34,624
Huh.

1010
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:36,959
The chemist from Shell? The union guy?

1011
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,263
Yeah. The FAECT guy.

1012
00:56:40,264 --> 00:56:43,934
He was moaning about how we're handling the war.

1013
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:45,802
How so?

1014
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:48,571
Lack of cooperation with our allies.

1015
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:52,742
Apparently our government's not sharing any research with the Russians.

1016
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:57,047
Well, he said, "Most scientists think the policy is stupid."

1017
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:02,151
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

1018
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:07,191
He mentioned that if anyone had anything they wanted to pass on,

1019
00:57:07,324 --> 00:57:11,361
going around official channels, that he could help.

1020
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,905
That would be treason.

1021
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,907
Yes, of course.

1022
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:26,310
I just thought you should know.

1023
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:32,316
The brat is down. Where are the martinis?

1024
00:57:37,588 --> 00:57:39,021
Coming right up.

1025
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:40,790
The conversation ended there.

1026
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:43,926
Nothing in our long-standing friendship would have led me to believe

1027
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:46,762
that Chevalier was actually seeking information,

1028
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:51,802
and I am certain that he had no idea of the work in which I was engaged.

1029
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,974
It has long been clear to me

1030
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:00,910
that I should have reported this incident at once.

1031
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:03,946
The Oppenheimer situation highlights the tension

1032
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:07,216
between scientists and the security apparatus.

1033
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:09,785
In hopes of learning how the nominee handled such issues

1034
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,654
during his time at the AEC,

1035
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:14,725
we'll have a scientist appearing before the committee.

1036
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:18,461
Who are they bringing in? They haven't said.

1037
00:58:18,462 --> 00:58:19,562
Mr. Chairman, if I may,

1038
00:58:19,563 --> 00:58:22,231
I'm nominated for commerce secretary.

1039
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:24,667
Why seek the opinion of scientists?

1040
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,903
This is a cabinet post, Admiral.

1041
00:58:26,904 --> 00:58:29,539
We seek a wide range of opinion.

1042
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,008
Well, I'd like to know the name of the scientist testifying,

1043
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,610
I'd like the chance to cross-examine.

1044
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:36,013
This is not a court.

1045
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:38,447
Formality, huh?

1046
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:41,951
No presidential Cabinet nominee has failed to be confirmed since 1925.

1047
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:44,153
This is just how the game is played.

1048
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:46,522
It's in the bag, Lewis. So play nice.

1049
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,758
They bring in a scientist, so what?

1050
00:58:48,759 --> 00:58:50,927
You don't know scientists like I do, Counselor.

1051
00:58:50,928 --> 00:58:53,129
They resent anyone who questions their judgment,

1052
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,164
especially if you're not one of them.

1053
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:56,599
I was chair of the AEC.

1054
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,734
I'm easy to blame for what happened to Robert.

1055
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:01,203
We can't have the Senate thinking the scientific community

1056
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,040
doesn't support you, sir.

1057
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:05,908
- Or should we pivot? - To what?

1058
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,343
And embrace it.

1059
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:10,112
"I fought Oppenheimer and the US won."

1060
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:11,847
I-I don't think we need to go there.

1061
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,983
Isn't there someone we can call who knows what really happened?

1062
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:15,785
- Teller. - He'll make an impression.

1063
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:18,421
- Can you get the name of the scientist they've called? - Probably.

1064
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:21,524
Find out if he was based in Chicago or Los Alamos during the war.

1065
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:24,060
- Why does that matter? - If he was based in Chicago,

1066
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,795
he worked under Szilard and Fermi,

1067
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:27,897
not the cult of Oppie at Los Alamos.

1068
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,365
Robert built that damn place.

1069
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:33,603
He was founder, mayor, sheriff, all rolled into one.

1070
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:47,884
All it needs is a saloon.

1071
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,947
Let's go and see.

1072
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:19,416
There's no kitchen.

1073
01:00:20,017 --> 01:00:22,586
Really? We'll fix that.

1074
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:33,729
Barbed wire? Guns? Oppie.

1075
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,465
We're at war, Hans.

1076
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:40,403
Halifax, 1917.

1077
01:00:40,404 --> 01:00:43,340
A cargo ship carrying munitions explodes in the harbor.

1078
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,712
A vast and sudden chemical reaction.

1079
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:54,917
The biggest man-made explosion in history.

1080
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:58,454
Now let's calculate how much more destructive it would have been

1081
01:00:58,455 --> 01:01:02,191
if it were a nuclear, and not a chemical, reaction.

1082
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:05,227
Expressing power in terms of tons of TNT.

1083
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:06,829
But it will be thousands.

1084
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:10,167
Well, then... kilotons.

1085
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:18,475
Using U-235, the bomb will need... Ah...

1086
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:20,643
Right, sorry.

1087
01:01:20,644 --> 01:01:24,313
Gadget will need a 33-pound sphere about this size.

1088
01:01:24,314 --> 01:01:28,085
Or using plutonium, the ten-pound sphere.

1089
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:33,757
Here's the amount of uranium Oak Ridge refined all of last month.

1090
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:40,530
And the Hanford plant made this much plutonium.

1091
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:46,570
Now, if we can enrich these amounts, we need a way to detonate them.

1092
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:49,339
Are we boring you, Edward?

1093
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:51,507
A little bit, yes.

1094
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:52,975
May I ask why?

1095
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:55,945
We all entered this room knowing a fission bomb was possible.

1096
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:59,715
- How about we leave it with something new? - Such as?

1097
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:03,754
Instead of uranium or plutonium, we use hydrogen.

1098
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,556
Heavy hydrogen.

1099
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,557
Deuterium.

1100
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:09,792
You see?

1101
01:02:09,793 --> 01:02:12,328
We compact the atoms together under great pressure

1102
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:14,531
to induce a fusion reaction.

1103
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:18,100
Then we'll get not kilotons,

1104
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:19,436
but megatons.

1105
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,971
Okay, hang on, hang on.

1106
01:02:21,972 --> 01:02:26,343
So how do you generate enough force to fuse hydrogen atoms?

1107
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:28,778
A small fission bomb.

1108
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:30,714
Ah... There we are!

1109
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,150
Well, since we're going to need one anyway,

1110
01:02:34,151 --> 01:02:36,185
can we get back to the business at hand?

1111
01:02:36,186 --> 01:02:41,123
The isotopes issue wasn't your most important policy disagreement

1112
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:42,458
with Dr. Oppenheimer,

1113
01:02:42,459 --> 01:02:44,960
it was the hydrogen bomb, wasn't it?

1114
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:50,000
As colleagues, we agreed to disagree on a great many things, uh,

1115
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:54,404
and, well, one of them was the need for an H-bomb program, yes.

1116
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:10,252
Thanks for convening on short notice.

1117
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:11,855
I can't believe it.

1118
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:14,290
Here we are.

1119
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,125
Catch me up. What do we know?

1120
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:20,462
One of our B-29s over the North Pacific has detected radiation.

1121
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,364
Do we have the filter paper?

1122
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:25,167
- There's no doubt what this is. - White House says there's a doubt.

1123
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:26,635
Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.

1124
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,673
Are those the long-range detection filter papers?

1125
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,108
It's an atomic test.

1126
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:36,979
The Russians have a bomb.

1127
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,349
We're supposed to be years ahead of them, but some...

1128
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:43,953
What were you guys doing at Los Alamos? Wasn't security tight?

1129
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:47,157
- Of course it was. You weren't there. - Forgive me, Doctor...

1130
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:50,393
but I was there.

1131
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:54,864
We can now consider the actual mechanics of detonation.

1132
01:03:54,865 --> 01:03:56,165
Any ideas?

1133
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,800
I call this "shooting."

1134
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:01,270
We fire a chunk of fissionable material into a larger sphere

1135
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:03,973
with enough force to achieve criticality.

1136
01:04:03,974 --> 01:04:05,608
What do we think? Anyone?

1137
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:07,376
I've been thinking about implosion.

1138
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:10,680
Explosives around the sphere blast inwards, crushing the material.

1139
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:13,415
I'd like to investigate that idea.

1140
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:15,819
I'll talk to Ordnance, get you blowing things up.

1141
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:19,155
- Progress? - Nice to see you too.

1142
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,590
Meet the British contingent.

1143
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,392
Dr. Oppenheimer, Klaus Fuchs.

1144
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:25,294
How long have you been British?

1145
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:27,496
Since Hitler told me I wasn't German. Aha.

1146
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:30,366
Come, welcome to Los Alamos.

1147
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,234
School's up and running.

1148
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:34,471
Bar... always running.

1149
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,674
And I thought of a way to reduce support staff.

1150
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,843
- Is that... - Mrs. Serber, yes.

1151
01:04:40,844 --> 01:04:44,313
I've offered jobs to all the wives. Admin, librarians, computation.

1152
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:46,482
We cut down on staff, keep families together.

1153
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:48,484
- Are these women qualified? - Don't be absurd.

1154
01:04:48,485 --> 01:04:50,819
These are some of the brightest minds in our community.

1155
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,655
And they're already security cleared.

1156
01:04:52,656 --> 01:04:54,223
I've informed General Groves you've been holding

1157
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:56,358
cross-divisional, open discussions on a nightly basis.

1158
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:57,927
Shut them down.

1159
01:04:57,928 --> 01:05:00,162
Compartmentalization is the key to maintaining security...

1160
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:01,497
It's only the top men.

1161
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:03,399
Who presumably communicate with subordinates.

1162
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,501
These men aren't stupid. They can be discreet.

1163
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:09,406
- I don't like it. - You don't like anything enough for that to be a fair test.

1164
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:17,546
Once a week. Top men only.

1165
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:20,350
- I'd like to bring my brother here. - No.

1166
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:24,019
Nichols.

1167
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,822
I still haven't heard that my security clearance has been approved.

1168
01:05:26,823 --> 01:05:29,024
- It hasn't. - We're going to Chicago tomorrow.

1169
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,626
Well, you should wait.

1170
01:05:30,627 --> 01:05:33,128
You are aware that the Nazis have a two-year head start?

1171
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:35,064
Dr. Oppenheimer, the fact that your security clearance

1172
01:05:35,065 --> 01:05:37,366
is proving difficult to obtain is not my fault.

1173
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:39,234
It's yours.

1174
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:41,937
May not be your fault, but it's your problem. Because I'm going.

1175
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,507
And how many people were in these, uh,

1176
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:46,809
open discussions?

1177
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:49,311
Too many. Compartmentalization was supposed to be the protocol.

1178
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,046
We were in a race against the Nazis.

1179
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:54,450
- And now the race is against the Soviets. - Not unless we start it.

1180
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:58,554
Robert, they just fired a starting gun.

1181
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:00,789
What's the nature of the device they detonated?

1182
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:04,460
The data indicates it may have been a plutonium implosion device.

1183
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,429
Like the one you built at Los Alamos.

1184
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:10,632
The Russians have a bomb, Truman needs to know what's next.

1185
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,601
What's next? Arms talks.

1186
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:14,437
- Arms talks. - Obviously.

1187
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:16,905
What about the Super?

1188
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:20,376
Does Truman even know about it? Did we brief him on that?

1189
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:21,810
Not specifically.

1190
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,479
We still don't know if a hydrogen bomb's

1191
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,813
technically feasible.

1192
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,682
My understanding is that Teller proposed it?

1193
01:06:26,683 --> 01:06:28,250
Yes. At Los Alamos?

1194
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:30,452
Teller's designs have always been wildly impractical.

1195
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:32,521
You'd have to deliver by ox cart.

1196
01:06:32,522 --> 01:06:34,523
- Not airplane. - Oppie.

1197
01:06:34,524 --> 01:06:36,993
I'm sorry, Dr. Lawrence. Do you want to comment?

1198
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:39,896
No.

1199
01:06:41,398 --> 01:06:43,899
Because if it can put us ahead again,

1200
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:48,939
the President of the United States needs to know about it.

1201
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:55,511
And if the Russians know about it already from a spy at Los Alamos,

1202
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:56,945
then we've gotta get going.

1203
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:59,882
There's no proof there was a spy at Los Alamos.

1204
01:06:59,883 --> 01:07:00,950
Robert.

1205
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:07,523
They put it under the football stadium?

1206
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,491
The field's not in use anymore.

1207
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:10,960
Just as well.

1208
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:15,497
- Oppie. - Dr. Fermi.

1209
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:18,133
Come stai? Va bene?

1210
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:20,904
I hear you got a little town. Yes. Come and see.

1211
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:25,909
Who could think straight in a place like that? Huh?

1212
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:28,610
Everybody will go crazy.

1213
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:31,915
Thank you for the vote of confidence, Szilard.

1214
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:36,385
Do we really... Do we really need that in the notes?

1215
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,454
When are you going to try it out?

1216
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:40,089
We did.

1217
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:43,726
The first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.

1218
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:45,661
Didn't Groves tell you?

1219
01:07:45,662 --> 01:07:47,664
No.

1220
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,204
One at a time, please. One at a time.

1221
01:07:55,205 --> 01:07:57,005
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1222
01:07:57,006 --> 01:08:00,275
I tried Personnel. They asked if I could type.

1223
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:01,477
Can you?

1224
01:08:01,478 --> 01:08:02,644
Harvard forgot to teach that

1225
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:04,447
on the graduate chemistry course.

1226
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,885
Condon, put Mrs. Hornig here on the plutonium team.

1227
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:16,425
What the hell were you doing in Chicago?

1228
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:17,860
Visiting the Met?

1229
01:08:17,861 --> 01:08:20,863
Why? Because we have every right...

1230
01:08:20,864 --> 01:08:25,134
You have just the rights that I give you. No more, no less.

1231
01:08:25,135 --> 01:08:27,269
We are adults trying to run a project here.

1232
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,971
This is ridiculous.

1233
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:30,039
Tell him.

1234
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:34,511
Compartmentalization is the protocol we agreed to.

1235
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,712
Enough of this madhouse.

1236
01:08:36,713 --> 01:08:38,714
Nobody can work under these conditions.

1237
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:41,884
You know what, Generalissimo?

1238
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:43,252
I quit.

1239
01:08:43,253 --> 01:08:44,687
Thanks for nothing.

1240
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:48,324
Better off without him.

1241
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:50,492
Aren't you more concerned

1242
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:52,829
about his discretion out there?

1243
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,198
We'll have him killed.

1244
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,834
I was just kidding.

1245
01:08:58,835 --> 01:09:01,170
No, he hates me, not America.

1246
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:04,373
You know, General, not everyone has levers to pull like mine.

1247
01:09:04,374 --> 01:09:06,141
I don't think I understand.

1248
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,443
You didn't hire me despite my left-wing past,

1249
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:10,179
you hired me because of it.

1250
01:09:11,114 --> 01:09:12,915
So you could control me.

1251
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:15,651
Well, I'm not that subtle.

1252
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,119
I'm just a humble soldier.

1253
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,188
You're neither humble, nor just a soldier.

1254
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:22,057
- You studied engineering at MIT. - Guilty as charged.

1255
01:09:22,058 --> 01:09:23,592
Well, now we understand each other,

1256
01:09:23,593 --> 01:09:25,127
perhaps you can get me my security clearance

1257
01:09:25,128 --> 01:09:28,031
so I can perform this miracle for you.

1258
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,671
General Groves, were you aware of Dr. Oppenheimer's

1259
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,106
left-wing associations when you appointed him?

1260
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:40,242
I was aware that there were suspicions about him.

1261
01:09:40,243 --> 01:09:43,378
I was aware he had a very extreme, liberal background.

1262
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:46,615
In your opinion, would he ever consciously commit a disloyal act?

1263
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:48,417
I would be amazed if he did.

1264
01:09:48,418 --> 01:09:51,320
So you had complete confidence in his integrity?

1265
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:54,056
At Los Alamos, yes, which is where I really knew him.

1266
01:09:54,057 --> 01:09:56,858
General, did your security officers on the project

1267
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,127
advise you against the clearance of Dr. Oppenheimer?

1268
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:02,965
They could not and would not clear him until I insisted.

1269
01:10:02,966 --> 01:10:07,002
And it's safe to say that you had a pretty good knowledge of Dr. Oppenheimer's security file.

1270
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:08,470
I did.

1271
01:10:08,471 --> 01:10:11,073
There's only really one question I need answered here today.

1272
01:10:11,074 --> 01:10:13,141
In light of the current AEC guidelines,

1273
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:15,811
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1274
01:10:15,812 --> 01:10:17,914
Do you have the guidelines?

1275
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,589
Under current AEC guidelines,

1276
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:31,561
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1277
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:44,607
Physics and New Mexico, huh?

1278
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:47,376
My God.

1279
01:10:47,377 --> 01:10:48,844
What a trek.

1280
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:50,379
That's why you need a liaison.

1281
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:51,948
I'm appointing Lomanitz.

1282
01:10:52,849 --> 01:10:54,182
You're gonna be okay.

1283
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:55,652
This way, gentlemen.

1284
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,362
- Dr. Lawrence. - Leslie.

1285
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:09,765
I'd like to remind you what we talked about in Berkeley.

1286
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:12,101
Compartmentalization. I understand completely.

1287
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,875
Thank you.

1288
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:28,650
Greetings from Berkeley.

1289
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:31,486
I am here to update you on our progress and solicit your input.

1290
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:34,089
To do so, I am going to have to share a few things

1291
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:36,892
that General Groves told me not to.

1292
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:39,828
Sorry, General, I said I understood, not that I agreed.

1293
01:11:39,829 --> 01:11:41,496
Okay.

1294
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:43,398
Gentlemen, to business.

1295
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:46,101
There were rumors of espionage at Los Alamos.

1296
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:47,602
Unsubstantiated.

1297
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:50,405
I'm told that there were communists on the project.

1298
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:52,474
We didn't knowingly employ any communists.

1299
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:55,210
Were any of them involved in discussions of the Super?

1300
01:11:55,211 --> 01:11:57,946
I seem to remember you demanding your brother come to Los Alamos.

1301
01:11:57,947 --> 01:11:59,748
My brother had left the Party by then.

1302
01:11:59,749 --> 01:12:01,049
What about Lomanitz?

1303
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,784
Lomanitz was never employed at Los Alamos.

1304
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:03,852
He was a liaison.

1305
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:05,087
Our security was tight,

1306
01:12:05,088 --> 01:12:06,988
as former Colonel Nichols well knows.

1307
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,491
Our security was as tight as it could be given the personalities involved,

1308
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:11,193
but attempts were made.

1309
01:12:11,194 --> 01:12:13,795
- What is that supposed to mean? - We've all read his file here.

1310
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:16,999
Do we need to talk about Jean Tatlock?

1311
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,103
Or the Chevalier incident?

1312
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:25,708
Excuse me.

1313
01:12:27,143 --> 01:12:30,346
That's Lomanitz, on line one.

1314
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:37,919
Hello, Rossi.

1315
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,157
What? Okay, just calm down.

1316
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:43,458
There's been another screw-up.

1317
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:45,060
Lomanitz just got drafted.

1318
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:47,829
- We are at war, Doctor. - Don't be an asshole, Nichols.

1319
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:49,898
We need this kid. Fix it, will you?

1320
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:51,266
It wasn't a mistake.

1321
01:12:51,267 --> 01:12:52,801
Your friend Lomanitz has been trying

1322
01:12:52,802 --> 01:12:54,169
to unionize the Radiation Lab.

1323
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:55,937
He promised to quit all that.

1324
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,873
Well, he hasn't.

1325
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:01,143
Security officer at Berkeley's concerned about communist infiltration

1326
01:13:01,144 --> 01:13:03,278
through that union, the FA...

1327
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:05,214
FAECT.

1328
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:09,785
Well, I'm there next week, I'll...

1329
01:13:09,786 --> 01:13:11,320
drop in to see him.

1330
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:15,024
Your Q clearance came through.

1331
01:13:18,528 --> 01:13:22,365
It's important you not maintain or renew any questionable associations.

1332
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:28,904
Doctor, did you think social contacts

1333
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:33,241
between a person engaged on secret war work and communists was dangerous?

1334
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:37,045
My awareness of the danger would be greater today.

1335
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:39,781
I mean, it's fair to say that during the war years,

1336
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:43,419
you felt that such contacts were potentially dangerous?

1337
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:52,594
Were conceivably dangerous, yes.

1338
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:56,399
I mean, really? Known communists?

1339
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:00,236
Look...

1340
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:05,641
I've had a lot of secrets in my head for a long time.

1341
01:14:06,576 --> 01:14:08,243
Doesn't matter who I associate with.

1342
01:14:08,244 --> 01:14:11,180
I don't talk about those secrets.

1343
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:20,389
You said in your statement

1344
01:14:21,424 --> 01:14:23,592
that you had to

1345
01:14:23,593 --> 01:14:26,095
see Jean Tatlock in 1943.

1346
01:14:27,697 --> 01:14:29,232
You left.

1347
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,733
Not a word.

1348
01:14:31,734 --> 01:14:34,470
What did you think that would do to me?

1349
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:36,705
I wrote.

1350
01:14:36,706 --> 01:14:38,975
Pages of nothing.

1351
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:43,179
Where did you go?

1352
01:14:44,714 --> 01:14:46,147
I can't tell you. Why not?

1353
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,050
Because you're a communist.

1354
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,354
Why did you have to see her?

1355
01:14:52,355 --> 01:14:57,225
Because she had indicated a great desire to see me before we left.

1356
01:14:57,226 --> 01:15:01,997
At that time, I couldn't, but I felt that she had to see me.

1357
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:04,799
She was undergoing psychiatric treatment.

1358
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,902
She was extremely unhappy.

1359
01:15:06,903 --> 01:15:09,338
Did you find out why she had to see you?

1360
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:16,379
Because she was still in love with me.

1361
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:25,488
Spent the night together, didn't you?

1362
01:15:33,496 --> 01:15:34,597
Yes.

1363
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,939
You drop in and out of my life

1364
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:46,575
and you don't have to tell me why.

1365
01:15:46,576 --> 01:15:47,943
Now, that's power.

1366
01:15:47,944 --> 01:15:50,612
Not that I enjoy.

1367
01:15:50,613 --> 01:15:53,214
I'd rather be here for you as you need.

1368
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,018
But you have other priorities now.

1369
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:58,487
I have a wife and child.

1370
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:02,258
That's not what either of us is talking about.

1371
01:16:05,828 --> 01:16:07,096
Jean.

1372
01:16:07,797 --> 01:16:09,432
You asked me to come.

1373
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:12,201
And I'm glad I did.

1374
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:14,870
But I can't see you again.

1375
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:19,875
But what if I need you?

1376
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,648
You said you would always answer.

1377
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:30,585
Not a word.

1378
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,988
Did you think that consistent with good security?

1379
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:36,092
As a matter of fact, it was. Not a word.

1380
01:16:37,493 --> 01:16:39,528
When did you see her after that?

1381
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,405
I never saw her again.

1382
01:16:55,645 --> 01:16:58,713
I can make the last train back to Princeton.

1383
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:01,216
Kitty, I didn't say anything that I hadn't already told you.

1384
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:05,021
Today you said it to history, didn't you? This is a closed hearing.

1385
01:17:06,756 --> 01:17:09,658
If they don't release the transcript, I'm sure you will.

1386
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:10,825
I was under oath.

1387
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:12,127
Well, you were under an oath to me

1388
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:13,996
when you went to see Jean.

1389
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:16,332
You know, you...

1390
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,566
you sit there,

1391
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:19,602
day after day,

1392
01:17:20,503 --> 01:17:23,205
letting them pick our lives to pieces.

1393
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:27,109
Why won't you fight?

1394
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:33,315
Robert, I'm not putting her up there.

1395
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:41,489
Dr. Oppenheimer, it's an honor. Please, take a seat.

1396
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,591
No need, I just wanted to check

1397
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:47,228
whether I should talk to Lomanitz while I'm here, given your concerns.

1398
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:50,598
Well, I'd say that's really up to you, Professor, but I'd be cautious.

1399
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:51,966
Uh-huh. Understood.

1400
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:54,436
Oh, and, um... ...as regards to the union,

1401
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:58,139
I wanted to give you a heads-up on a man named Eltenton.

1402
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,641
- A heads-up? - Yes.

1403
01:17:59,642 --> 01:18:02,978
Just that he might merit watching, is all.

1404
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,747
I'd love to get more details.

1405
01:18:05,748 --> 01:18:08,850
Well, I have an appointment now, and I leave early tomorrow.

1406
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:12,988
Well, come back as early as you like. Since you haven't time now.

1407
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:15,623
You went back the next morning.

1408
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:17,660
I did. I had to, really.

1409
01:18:18,461 --> 01:18:20,496
This time there was another man.

1410
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:23,298
He said his name was Pash.

1411
01:18:23,299 --> 01:18:25,834
Pash. You met Colonel Pash?

1412
01:18:25,835 --> 01:18:28,870
Colonel Pash, could you please read from your memo

1413
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:31,407
dated June 29, 1943?

1414
01:18:32,775 --> 01:18:35,376
"Results of surveillance conducted on subject

1415
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:38,346
indicate further possible Communist Party connections.

1416
01:18:38,347 --> 01:18:40,882
Subject met with, and spent considerable time with,

1417
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:42,851
one Jean Tatlock, communist,

1418
01:18:42,852 --> 01:18:44,285
the record of whom is attached."

1419
01:18:44,286 --> 01:18:46,988
- The subject being Dr. Oppenheimer? - Yes.

1420
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:48,423
Whom you had not met?

1421
01:18:48,424 --> 01:18:50,291
Not then, but soon after.

1422
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:52,627
He's the head of security for the project. Shouldn't I know him?

1423
01:18:52,628 --> 01:18:56,531
No, he should know you. I would never put you in a room with Pash.

1424
01:18:56,532 --> 01:18:58,032
Why not?

1425
01:18:58,033 --> 01:18:59,734
When Pash first heard about Lomanitz,

1426
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,937
he told the FBI he was gonna kidnap him,

1427
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:04,606
take him out on a boat

1428
01:19:04,607 --> 01:19:07,376
and interrogate him in the Russian manner.

1429
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:12,347
General Groves has placed in me a certain responsibility,

1430
01:19:12,348 --> 01:19:14,750
and it's like having a child who I can't see.

1431
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,253
By remote control.

1432
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:19,822
So to actually meet you is...

1433
01:19:21,557 --> 01:19:24,225
- I won't take up too much of your time. - No, not at all.

1434
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:26,361
Whatever time you choose.

1435
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:28,530
Mr. Johnson told me of a conversation you had yesterday

1436
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:30,031
in which I'm very interested.

1437
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:32,066
It's had me worried all day.

1438
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:35,770
Yes, well, I didn't want to talk to Lomanitz without authorization.

1439
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,772
That's not the particular interest that I have.

1440
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,608
It's something a little bit more...

1441
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:42,410
in my opinion, more serious.

1442
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:45,213
Now, when the FBI pointed out that such information

1443
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:46,981
wouldn't be admissible in court,

1444
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:49,951
Pash made it clear he had no intention of leaving any witness left

1445
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:51,019
to prosecute.

1446
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:52,420
Now, the FBI talked him down,

1447
01:19:52,421 --> 01:19:53,922
but that's the man you're dancing with.

1448
01:19:53,923 --> 01:19:56,758
I gather you've heard there are other parties

1449
01:19:56,759 --> 01:19:59,427
interested in the work of the Radiation Lab?

1450
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:03,331
A man attached to the Soviet Consul

1451
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:06,401
indicated through intermediate people

1452
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:08,169
to people on this project

1453
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:09,971
that he was in a position

1454
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,506
to transmit information.

1455
01:20:11,507 --> 01:20:14,276
Why would anyone on the project wanna do that?

1456
01:20:15,778 --> 01:20:18,279
Frankly, I can see that there might be an argument

1457
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,648
for the commander-in-chief informing the Russians.

1458
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,717
They're our allies after all.

1459
01:20:22,718 --> 01:20:25,620
But I don't like the idea of it going out the back door.

1460
01:20:25,621 --> 01:20:28,257
It might not hurt to be on the lookout for it.

1461
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:30,959
And you said that to Pash?

1462
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,296
I was trying to put it in the context of "Russia's not Germany."

1463
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:39,968
Boris Pash is the son of a Russian Orthodox bishop.

1464
01:20:39,969 --> 01:20:41,769
Born here, but in 1918,

1465
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:44,172
he went back to Russia to fight the Bolsheviks.

1466
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:47,108
This is a man who has killed communists with his own hands.

1467
01:20:47,109 --> 01:20:50,478
I'm not the judge of who should or should not have information.

1468
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:53,214
It's my business to stop it from going through illegally.

1469
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:55,384
Would you be a little more specific?

1470
01:20:57,419 --> 01:21:01,623
There's a man whose name was mentioned to me a couple of times.

1471
01:21:01,624 --> 01:21:03,524
Eltenton.

1472
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:06,895
Uh, I believe he's a chemist who works at Shell.

1473
01:21:06,896 --> 01:21:09,864
He talked to a friend of his

1474
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:13,202
who's an acquaintance of someone on the project.

1475
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:16,905
And you thought Pash would be satisfied with that?

1476
01:21:16,906 --> 01:21:21,042
I was attempting to give them Eltenton without opening a can of worms.

1477
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:22,810
I told them a cock-and-bull story.

1478
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:24,479
Did you lie to General Groves too?

1479
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,949
No. I admitted to him that I'd lied to Pash.

1480
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:31,419
Do you recall this conversation about the Chevalier incident?

1481
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:34,255
I've seen so many versions of it,

1482
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:37,125
I wasn't confused before but I'm certainly getting there now.

1483
01:21:37,126 --> 01:21:38,359
What was your conclusion?

1484
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,762
That he was under the influence of

1485
01:21:40,763 --> 01:21:43,665
the typical American schoolboy attitude

1486
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:47,302
that there's something wicked about telling on a friend.

1487
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:49,037
Well, now...

1488
01:21:49,038 --> 01:21:51,773
Might we know through whom the contact was made?

1489
01:21:51,774 --> 01:21:56,277
That would involve people who are not to be involved in this.

1490
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:59,013
Is that someone a member of the project?

1491
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:04,053
- A member of the faculty, yes, but not in the project, no. - Ah.

1492
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:09,524
So Eltenton made his approach through a member of the faculty here at Berkeley?

1493
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,761
As far as I know... As far as I know, yes.

1494
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:15,931
But... ...there may have been

1495
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:18,634
more than one person involved.

1496
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:27,408
Gentlemen, if I... If I seem uncooperative, I think you can understand

1497
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:28,743
it's because of my insistence

1498
01:22:28,744 --> 01:22:31,346
in not getting innocent people into trouble.

1499
01:22:31,347 --> 01:22:34,482
You're trying to protect your friend. Who's protecting you?

1500
01:22:34,483 --> 01:22:37,218
- Well, you could. - If you gave me the name.

1501
01:22:37,219 --> 01:22:38,786
If you order me to, I'll do it.

1502
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:42,091
That is a mistake, Robert. You need to volunteer this name.

1503
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:45,793
- And did he give you the name? - He did.

1504
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,562
But not then, did he? No.

1505
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:49,964
No. In fact, it was some months later, wasn't it?

1506
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,265
It was.

1507
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:53,735
- You see me as persistent. - Well, you are...

1508
01:22:53,736 --> 01:22:55,770
You are persistent, but that is your job.

1509
01:22:55,771 --> 01:22:59,273
And-And my job is to protect the people that work for me.

1510
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:03,545
Instead of us going on certain steps, which may come to your attention...

1511
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:06,814
and be disturbing to you,

1512
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:09,617
I would like to discuss those with you first.

1513
01:23:09,618 --> 01:23:13,822
I'm not formulating a plan. I'll just have to digest the whole thing.

1514
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:20,962
In the months in between your interview with Dr. Oppenheimer

1515
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:23,498
and his eventual naming of Chevalier,

1516
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:26,701
did you expend resources trying to find the name of the intermediary?

1517
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:29,070
Considerable resources, yes.

1518
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:31,372
Without the name, our job was extremely difficult.

1519
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:32,974
And when did you receive the name?

1520
01:23:32,975 --> 01:23:35,710
I was gone by the time Oppenheimer finally offered it up.

1521
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:39,013
- Gone? - They felt my time would be better spent in Europe

1522
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,382
determining the status of the Nazi bomb project.

1523
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:42,785
Who did?

1524
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:45,020
General Groves.

1525
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:47,556
He transferred me to London.

1526
01:23:53,996 --> 01:23:55,897
It's a little early for a Christmas party.

1527
01:23:55,898 --> 01:23:59,501
Something's up. Tolman's been away.

1528
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:01,702
Where?

1529
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,105
Ruth won't tell.

1530
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:09,077
Hey!

1531
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:16,784
Come on, Ruthie. Can't tell me, who can you tell?

1532
01:24:16,785 --> 01:24:18,620
Compartmentalization, Oppie.

1533
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:21,622
What makes you think I know where he is anyway?

1534
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:23,491
'Cause you do a pretty good job of knowing

1535
01:24:23,492 --> 01:24:25,627
where Mr. Tolman is when it counts.

1536
01:24:26,128 --> 01:24:27,161
Like now?

1537
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:30,499
Attention!

1538
01:24:33,135 --> 01:24:35,604
Early Christmas present for you all.

1539
01:24:43,712 --> 01:24:46,013
The British pilots put me in the bomb bay.

1540
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:49,284
Showed me the-the oxygen, you know, but I messed it up.

1541
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:52,653
When they opened me up in Scotland, I was unconscious.

1542
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:55,690
But I pretended I'd been napping.

1543
01:24:55,691 --> 01:24:57,493
Please enjoy your party.

1544
01:24:58,427 --> 01:24:59,927
Is it big enough?

1545
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:01,463
To end the war?

1546
01:25:01,997 --> 01:25:04,132
To end all war.

1547
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:11,405
Heisenberg sought me out in Copenhagen.

1548
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:14,876
It was chilling, my old student working for the Nazis.

1549
01:25:14,877 --> 01:25:18,914
He told me some things to draw me out.

1550
01:25:19,715 --> 01:25:22,650
Sustained fission reactions in uranium.

1551
01:25:22,651 --> 01:25:24,785
That sounds more like a reactor than a bomb.

1552
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,654
Did he mention gaseous diffusion?

1553
01:25:26,655 --> 01:25:29,090
He seemed more focused on heavy water.

1554
01:25:29,091 --> 01:25:30,758
As a moderator?

1555
01:25:30,759 --> 01:25:32,227
Yes, instead of graphite.

1556
01:25:35,264 --> 01:25:36,732
What?

1557
01:25:37,566 --> 01:25:40,401
He took a wrong turn. We're ahead.

1558
01:25:40,402 --> 01:25:42,203
And with you here to help us, Niels...

1559
01:25:42,204 --> 01:25:46,208
Sorry, could you... could you give us a moment, gentlemen?

1560
01:25:52,581 --> 01:25:55,383
I am not here to help, Robert.

1561
01:25:55,384 --> 01:25:57,618
I knew you could do this without me.

1562
01:25:57,619 --> 01:25:59,587
Then why did you come? To talk about after.

1563
01:25:59,588 --> 01:26:04,393
The power you're about to reveal will forever outlive the Nazis.

1564
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:07,195
And the world is not prepared.

1565
01:26:07,196 --> 01:26:10,164
"You could lift the stone without being ready for the snake that's revealed."

1566
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,300
We have to make the politicians understand,

1567
01:26:12,301 --> 01:26:13,902
this isn't a new weapon.

1568
01:26:14,403 --> 01:26:15,803
It's a new world.

1569
01:26:15,804 --> 01:26:19,340
I'll be out there doing what I can, but you...

1570
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:22,043
You are an American Prometheus.

1571
01:26:22,044 --> 01:26:26,214
The man who gave them the power to destroy themselves,

1572
01:26:26,215 --> 01:26:27,882
and they'll respect that.

1573
01:26:27,883 --> 01:26:30,152
Then your work really begins.

1574
01:26:34,623 --> 01:26:37,159
I'm sorry, Oppie, but there's a call.

1575
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,262
From San Francisco.

1576
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:48,604
Robert?

1577
01:26:52,975 --> 01:26:54,442
Robert?

1578
01:26:54,443 --> 01:26:57,011
Robert. Robert.

1579
01:26:57,012 --> 01:26:58,679
Oh, my God. What's the matter?

1580
01:26:58,680 --> 01:26:59,881
What happened?

1581
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:03,417
Her father called.

1582
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:05,187
They found her yesterday in the bath.

1583
01:27:07,022 --> 01:27:08,123
Who?

1584
01:27:09,458 --> 01:27:10,958
She'd taken pills.

1585
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:12,461
Left a note, not signed.

1586
01:27:13,795 --> 01:27:17,032
She took barbiturates, but there was chloral hydrate in her blood.

1587
01:27:20,469 --> 01:27:21,870
There was a note.

1588
01:27:22,471 --> 01:27:24,039
Jean Tatlock?

1589
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:31,812
We were together.

1590
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:34,182
She said she needed me. I...

1591
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:38,987
I told her I... ...I wouldn't...

1592
01:27:39,655 --> 01:27:41,455
I told her I couldn't...

1593
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:43,725
No, it was... it was me...

1594
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:48,195
You don't get to commit the sin

1595
01:27:48,196 --> 01:27:51,967
and then have us all feel sorry for you that it had consequences.

1596
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:57,139
You pull yourself together.

1597
01:28:00,909 --> 01:28:03,078
You know, people here depend on you.

1598
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:07,148
Donald, would you like to contribute here, please?

1599
01:28:07,149 --> 01:28:09,150
You're on your own, pal.

1600
01:28:09,151 --> 01:28:11,352
Bob, I'm not quitting my job because plutonium is radioactive.

1601
01:28:11,353 --> 01:28:14,355
We just don't know what it might do to the female reproductive system...

1602
01:28:14,356 --> 01:28:17,491
Your reproductive system is more exposed than mine, presumably.

1603
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:20,294
Can we please? The implosion device is nowhere.

1604
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,430
You can't rush everything. Oppie, please.

1605
01:28:22,431 --> 01:28:24,765
Well, there's rushing and there's getting on with it, so, pick one.

1606
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:26,734
Wait. Neddermeyer's doing his job.

1607
01:28:26,735 --> 01:28:29,303
Teller's not helping. You're not helping.

1608
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:32,006
I've been asking for calculations on the implosion lenses for weeks.

1609
01:28:32,007 --> 01:28:34,575
- The British can do it. Fuchs. - Absolutely.

1610
01:28:34,576 --> 01:28:38,079
- It's your job, Teller. - I'm engaged in research.

1611
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,682
On a hydrogen bomb we're not even building.

1612
01:28:48,857 --> 01:28:50,258
I won't work for that man.

1613
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,161
Let him go. He's a prima Donna.

1614
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,397
I agree. He should leave Los Alamos.

1615
01:28:56,398 --> 01:28:58,265
Okay.

1616
01:28:58,266 --> 01:29:01,102
Kisty, you replace Neddermeyer. Seth, I'm putting you on plutonium.

1617
01:29:01,103 --> 01:29:04,772
Lilli, you go work for Kisty, because he needs you.

1618
01:29:04,773 --> 01:29:06,374
Fuchs, you take Teller's role.

1619
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:09,477
I'm putting you exclusively on the implosion device.

1620
01:29:09,478 --> 01:29:13,248
And no one is leaving Los Alamos.

1621
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:28,763
They won't let me leave.

1622
01:29:28,764 --> 01:29:30,999
No. I won't let you leave.

1623
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:35,035
Forget Hans. Forget fission.

1624
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:38,205
Stay here, research what you want.

1625
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,741
Fusion, the hydrogen bomb, whatever.

1626
01:29:40,742 --> 01:29:42,476
We'll meet to discuss.

1627
01:29:42,477 --> 01:29:44,979
You don't have time to meet. You're a politician now, Robert.

1628
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:47,883
You've left physics behind many, many years ago.

1629
01:29:48,784 --> 01:29:50,484
Once a week.

1630
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:52,354
One hour, you and me.

1631
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:00,028
Now raise this fucking barrier.

1632
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:08,569
So the Super was under development on your watch at Los Alamos?

1633
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,104
Yes.

1634
01:30:10,105 --> 01:30:13,407
And yet, after the war, you tried to deny it was viable.

1635
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:16,544
No, no, no. I-I pointed out technical difficulties with it.

1636
01:30:16,545 --> 01:30:18,779
Didn't you try to kill it at the AEC meeting

1637
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:20,481
- after the Russian bomb test? - No.

1638
01:30:20,482 --> 01:30:23,451
But that was the recommendation of the AEC, was it not?

1639
01:30:23,452 --> 01:30:26,821
After hours of discussion about the best response.

1640
01:30:26,822 --> 01:30:31,860
An H-bomb is 1,000 times the power of an A-bomb.

1641
01:30:32,661 --> 01:30:36,964
Its only intended target would be the largest cities.

1642
01:30:36,965 --> 01:30:38,899
It's a weapon of mass genocide.

1643
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:42,903
Izzy, draw some circles on this side of the map where they would target us.

1644
01:30:42,904 --> 01:30:44,138
Starting with New York.

1645
01:30:44,139 --> 01:30:45,606
- That's fair. - DC.

1646
01:30:45,607 --> 01:30:48,008
It's a weapon of attack with no defensive value.

1647
01:30:48,009 --> 01:30:49,910
- Deterrence. - "Deterrence"?

1648
01:30:49,911 --> 01:30:53,614
Do we really need more deterrence than our current arsenal of atomic bombs?

1649
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:57,918
Y-You drown in ten feet of water or 10,000, what's the difference?

1650
01:30:57,919 --> 01:31:00,087
We can already drown Russia. They know it.

1651
01:31:00,088 --> 01:31:02,791
- Now they can drown us. - We're just escalating.

1652
01:31:06,328 --> 01:31:09,264
Robert? Robert.

1653
01:31:13,235 --> 01:31:14,969
As I said, Teller's designs

1654
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:18,205
are still as impractical as they were during the war.

1655
01:31:18,206 --> 01:31:20,941
A hydrogen bomb can be made to work, Oppie, you know that.

1656
01:31:20,942 --> 01:31:23,844
I don't believe we should commit all our resources to that chance.

1657
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:27,114
Then how would you have Truman reassure the American people?

1658
01:31:27,115 --> 01:31:29,450
Simply by limiting the spread of atomic weapons

1659
01:31:29,451 --> 01:31:32,720
through international control on nuclear energy.

1660
01:31:32,721 --> 01:31:34,355
By which you mean world government.

1661
01:31:34,356 --> 01:31:37,291
The United Nations, as Roosevelt intended.

1662
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:40,060
Well, I asked what Truman should do, right?

1663
01:31:40,061 --> 01:31:41,795
The world's changed.

1664
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:44,899
It's not fascism but communism that now threatens our survival.

1665
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:46,867
Lewis, do you understand,

1666
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:48,402
if we build a hydrogen bomb,

1667
01:31:48,403 --> 01:31:50,838
the Russians will have no choice but to build their own?

1668
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:52,373
Could they be working on one already,

1669
01:31:52,374 --> 01:31:55,609
based on information gathered from a spy at Los Alamos?

1670
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:57,244
No spy at Los Alamos.

1671
01:31:57,245 --> 01:31:59,246
Gentlemen. Let's not get sidetracked. There wasn't?

1672
01:31:59,247 --> 01:32:02,583
I say we use this moment to gain concessions from the Russians

1673
01:32:02,584 --> 01:32:05,819
by committing that we will not build a hydrogen bomb.

1674
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:07,421
Thereby revealing its existence.

1675
01:32:07,422 --> 01:32:09,557
Which you seem convinced they already know.

1676
01:32:09,558 --> 01:32:13,093
All right. At this point, I'd like the committee members

1677
01:32:13,094 --> 01:32:17,098
to meet in privacy to finalize our recommendations.

1678
01:32:18,333 --> 01:32:20,501
I'm just not sure you wanna go down this road.

1679
01:32:20,502 --> 01:32:21,902
Lewis, with respect,

1680
01:32:21,903 --> 01:32:24,472
we are the advisory committee, we will give them our advice.

1681
01:32:29,844 --> 01:32:31,278
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1682
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:32,580
Hi.

1683
01:32:32,581 --> 01:32:35,382
William Borden. Joint Committee on Atomic Energy?

1684
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:36,650
Oh, yes, yes.

1685
01:32:36,651 --> 01:32:38,219
During the war, I was a pilot.

1686
01:32:39,354 --> 01:32:42,089
One night, flying back from a raid,

1687
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:43,991
I saw an amazing sight,

1688
01:32:43,992 --> 01:32:45,793
like a meteor.

1689
01:32:45,794 --> 01:32:48,762
A V-2 rocket headed to England.

1690
01:32:48,763 --> 01:32:52,032
I can't help but imagine what it will be for such an enemy rocket

1691
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:54,970
to carry an atomic warhead.

1692
01:33:03,712 --> 01:33:07,482
Well, let's make sure we're not the ones to make that possible.

1693
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:15,223
Oppie, I don't think you wanna go up against Strauss.

1694
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:18,392
If we both speak, they listen to me.

1695
01:33:18,393 --> 01:33:20,361
When you speak, they hear a prophet.

1696
01:33:20,362 --> 01:33:22,296
When Strauss speaks, they hear themselves.

1697
01:33:22,297 --> 01:33:24,431
They'll listen to a prophet.

1698
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:27,234
A prophet can't be wrong. Not once.

1699
01:33:27,235 --> 01:33:30,904
Didn't you accuse Oppenheimer of sabotaging the development of the Super?

1700
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:35,609
I was never one of those to bandy around terms like "sabotage."

1701
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,645
But Mr. Borden was?

1702
01:33:37,646 --> 01:33:39,413
As I understand it, possibly.

1703
01:33:39,414 --> 01:33:43,083
How was Mr. Borden able to put together such a detailed indictment?

1704
01:33:43,084 --> 01:33:44,618
He was no longer a government employee,

1705
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,021
yet he appears to have had unlimited access

1706
01:33:47,022 --> 01:33:48,756
to Dr. Oppenheimer's file.

1707
01:33:48,757 --> 01:33:51,358
Might Mr. Nichols have given him access to the file?

1708
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:53,527
Or someone else at the AEC?

1709
01:33:53,528 --> 01:33:56,363
That's a very serious accusation, Senator.

1710
01:33:56,364 --> 01:33:57,931
Is it your intention to suggest

1711
01:33:57,932 --> 01:34:00,701
that Dr. Oppenheimer is disloyal to the United States?

1712
01:34:00,702 --> 01:34:03,437
I've always assumed, and still assume,

1713
01:34:03,438 --> 01:34:06,040
that he's loyal to the United States.

1714
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:07,708
I believe this. And I shall believe it

1715
01:34:07,709 --> 01:34:10,310
until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.

1716
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:14,983
Do you, or do you not believe that Dr. Oppenheimer is a security risk?

1717
01:34:23,258 --> 01:34:26,560
And if I may, when Hitler blew his brains out in that bunker,

1718
01:34:26,561 --> 01:34:30,030
it is my humble opinion that there is no need for that bomb to be seen

1719
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:31,700
anywhere except for that test site.

1720
01:34:33,301 --> 01:34:35,002
We at least have to take a moment to think about

1721
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:38,540
whether the means justify the ends any longer, because...

1722
01:34:41,076 --> 01:34:43,244
Germany is about to surrender.

1723
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:49,283
It's no longer the enemy who are the greatest threat to mankind.

1724
01:34:49,284 --> 01:34:50,552
It's our work.

1725
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:55,623
Hitler is dead, it's true.

1726
01:34:57,359 --> 01:34:59,026
But the Japanese fight on.

1727
01:34:59,027 --> 01:35:00,694
Their defeat seems assured.

1728
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:03,665
Not if you're a GI preparing to invade.

1729
01:35:05,066 --> 01:35:06,633
We can end this war.

1730
01:35:06,634 --> 01:35:09,704
But how do we justify using this weapon on human beings?

1731
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:15,810
We're theorists, yes?

1732
01:35:16,845 --> 01:35:21,382
We imagine a future, and our imaginings horrify us.

1733
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:24,752
But they won't fear it until they understand it,

1734
01:35:24,753 --> 01:35:27,554
and they won't understand it until they've used it.

1735
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:31,492
When the world learns the terrible secret of Los Alamos,

1736
01:35:31,493 --> 01:35:34,895
our work here will ensure a peace mankind has never seen.

1737
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:38,265
A peace based on the kind of international cooperation

1738
01:35:38,266 --> 01:35:40,635
that Roosevelt always envisaged.

1739
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:48,676
- Progress? - Two years and a billion dollars' worth?

1740
01:35:49,377 --> 01:35:51,145
Well, hard to put a price on it.

1741
01:35:51,146 --> 01:35:52,880
Not really. Just add up the bills.

1742
01:35:52,881 --> 01:35:57,217
"Rural free deliveries." Eighty babies delivered the first year.

1743
01:35:57,218 --> 01:35:59,753
This year we've had ten a month.

1744
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:03,257
Birth control is a little out of my jurisdiction, General.

1745
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:04,591
- Clearly. - General.

1746
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:05,727
Kiddo.

1747
01:36:10,498 --> 01:36:13,768
Head down, every... Fuchs. Head down.

1748
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:22,476
That's the one.

1749
01:36:22,477 --> 01:36:25,346
Two viable bombs. I need a date.

1750
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:29,550
September.

1751
01:36:29,551 --> 01:36:30,584
July.

1752
01:36:30,585 --> 01:36:32,554
That's the sweet spot, gentlemen.

1753
01:36:33,154 --> 01:36:34,822
August.

1754
01:36:34,823 --> 01:36:36,323
July.

1755
01:36:36,324 --> 01:36:39,627
Test in July. But I need my brother.

1756
01:36:43,665 --> 01:36:46,366
Frank knows the desert, he's left politics behind,

1757
01:36:46,367 --> 01:36:48,803
he's been working with Lawrence for two years now.

1758
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:57,545
What do we call the test?

1759
01:36:58,746 --> 01:37:02,516
"Batter my heart, three person'd God."

1760
01:37:02,517 --> 01:37:03,585
What?

1761
01:37:05,019 --> 01:37:06,254
Trinity.

1762
01:37:13,962 --> 01:37:17,364
You insisted on bringing on your brother Frank, a known communist.

1763
01:37:17,365 --> 01:37:19,132
Former communist.

1764
01:37:19,133 --> 01:37:20,934
You brought a known former communist

1765
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:24,805
onto America's most secret and important defense project.

1766
01:37:24,806 --> 01:37:28,075
I knew my brother could be trusted. Absolutely.

1767
01:37:28,076 --> 01:37:31,545
And you felt your judgment was sound on who on the team could be trusted.

1768
01:37:31,546 --> 01:37:35,583
Fuchs, head down. Okay, everybody ready.

1769
01:37:44,626 --> 01:37:46,326
I hope you learned something.

1770
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:48,996
Yeah, we learned we're gonna need to be a lot further away.

1771
01:37:48,997 --> 01:37:50,898
Well, figure it out. Fast.

1772
01:37:50,899 --> 01:37:53,619
We leave for Washington in the morning. We're gonna give them a date.

1773
01:38:08,516 --> 01:38:10,417
You're a long way from Chicago, Leo.

1774
01:38:10,418 --> 01:38:13,120
If we don't act now, they're going to use this thing against Japan.

1775
01:38:13,121 --> 01:38:16,723
We booked a meeting with Truman, but somebody killed it.

1776
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:19,259
You're meeting the secretary of war.

1777
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:20,761
Just because we're building it

1778
01:38:20,762 --> 01:38:22,864
doesn't mean we get to decide how it's used.

1779
01:38:23,531 --> 01:38:25,466
History will judge us, Robert.

1780
01:38:26,534 --> 01:38:28,703
In Chicago, we put together a petition.

1781
01:38:29,337 --> 01:38:30,972
I'm not getting into that.

1782
01:38:36,077 --> 01:38:38,979
Just tell me your concerns and I'll relay them. My concerns?

1783
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:42,549
Germany's defeated. Japan's not going to hold out alone.

1784
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:44,584
How could you know that? You got us into this.

1785
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:48,188
You and Einstein with your letter to Roosevelt saying we could build a bomb.

1786
01:38:48,189 --> 01:38:52,359
Against Germany. That's not how weapons manufacture works, Szilard.

1787
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:53,894
Oppie, you have to help.

1788
01:38:53,895 --> 01:38:55,829
Fermi's in the meeting. Lawrence is in the meeting.

1789
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:58,732
They're not you. You're the great salesman of science.

1790
01:38:58,733 --> 01:39:01,369
You can convince anyone of anything.

1791
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:03,338
Even yourself.

1792
01:39:03,972 --> 01:39:05,006
Excuse me.

1793
01:39:06,374 --> 01:39:09,776
The firestorm in Tokyo killed 100,000 people.

1794
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:11,378
Mostly civilians.

1795
01:39:11,379 --> 01:39:15,749
I worry about an America where we do these things and no one protests.

1796
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:19,086
Pearl Harbor and three years of brutal conflict in the Pacific

1797
01:39:19,087 --> 01:39:21,555
bought us a lot of latitude with the American public.

1798
01:39:21,556 --> 01:39:23,991
Enough to unleash the atomic bomb?

1799
01:39:23,992 --> 01:39:27,461
The A-bomb might not cause as much damage as the Tokyo bombings.

1800
01:39:27,462 --> 01:39:28,895
What are we estimating?

1801
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:33,800
In a medium-sized city, 20,000 or 30,000 dead.

1802
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:35,902
Yes, but don't underestimate

1803
01:39:35,903 --> 01:39:39,506
the psychological impact of an atomic explosion.

1804
01:39:39,507 --> 01:39:43,910
A pillar of fire 10,000 feet tall.

1805
01:39:43,911 --> 01:39:47,247
Deadly neutron effects for a mile. In all directions.

1806
01:39:47,248 --> 01:39:50,217
From one single device.

1807
01:39:50,218 --> 01:39:52,219
Dropped from a barely noticed B-29,

1808
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:57,258
the atomic bomb will be a terrible revelation of divine power.

1809
01:39:57,659 --> 01:40:01,028
If that's true, it would be definitive.

1810
01:40:01,029 --> 01:40:03,096
World War II would be over.

1811
01:40:03,097 --> 01:40:04,598
Our boys would come home.

1812
01:40:04,599 --> 01:40:05,967
Military targets?

1813
01:40:07,035 --> 01:40:09,236
Uh... There aren't any big enough.

1814
01:40:09,237 --> 01:40:12,239
Perhaps a vital war plant

1815
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,775
with workers housed nearby?

1816
01:40:14,776 --> 01:40:17,978
And we could issue a warning to reduce civilian casualties.

1817
01:40:17,979 --> 01:40:20,180
They'd send everything they have up against us,

1818
01:40:20,181 --> 01:40:21,782
and I'd be up in that plane.

1819
01:40:21,783 --> 01:40:25,018
But if we announce it and it fails to go off,

1820
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:27,554
we'd scupper any chance of a Japanese surrender.

1821
01:40:27,555 --> 01:40:32,159
Is there no way to demonstrate a bomb to Japan to provoke surrender?

1822
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:36,530
We intend to demonstrate it in the most unambiguous terms. Twice.

1823
01:40:36,531 --> 01:40:38,565
Once, to show the weapon's power,

1824
01:40:38,566 --> 01:40:42,369
and a second to show that we can keep doing this until they surrender.

1825
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:45,939
We have a list of 12 cities to choose from...

1826
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:47,741
Sorry, 11.

1827
01:40:47,742 --> 01:40:49,709
I've taken Kyoto off the list

1828
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:53,413
due to its cultural significance to the Japanese people.

1829
01:40:53,414 --> 01:40:56,183
Also, my wife and I honeymooned there.

1830
01:40:56,184 --> 01:40:57,685
It's a magnificent city.

1831
01:41:01,155 --> 01:41:02,923
Let me make this simple for you, gentlemen.

1832
01:41:02,924 --> 01:41:05,292
According to my intelligence, which I cannot share with you,

1833
01:41:05,293 --> 01:41:09,429
the Japanese people will not surrender, under any circumstances,

1834
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:13,667
short of a successful and total invasion of the home islands.

1835
01:41:13,668 --> 01:41:16,203
Many lives will be lost, American and Japanese.

1836
01:41:16,204 --> 01:41:20,407
The use of the atomic bomb on Japanese cities will save lives.

1837
01:41:20,408 --> 01:41:24,077
- If we retain moral advantage. - How so?

1838
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:26,079
Well, if we use this weapon without informing our allies,

1839
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,782
they'll see it as a threat, and we'll be in an arms race.

1840
01:41:28,783 --> 01:41:31,251
How open can we be with the Soviets?

1841
01:41:31,252 --> 01:41:35,555
Secrecy won't stop the Soviets from becoming part of the atomic world.

1842
01:41:35,556 --> 01:41:37,424
We've been told they have no uranium.

1843
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:40,660
You've been misinformed. A Russian bomb is a matter of time.

1844
01:41:40,661 --> 01:41:44,298
The program needs to continue at full pace after the war.

1845
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:46,800
Secretary Stimson, if I may,

1846
01:41:46,801 --> 01:41:50,637
not all scientists on the project are in agreement.

1847
01:41:50,638 --> 01:41:54,374
In fact, this might be a moment to consider other opinions. If you talk...

1848
01:41:54,375 --> 01:41:57,177
The Manhattan Project has been plagued from the start

1849
01:41:57,178 --> 01:42:00,747
by certain scientists of doubtful discretion

1850
01:42:00,748 --> 01:42:02,182
and uncertain loyalty.

1851
01:42:02,183 --> 01:42:04,217
One of them just tried to meet with the president.

1852
01:42:04,218 --> 01:42:07,354
Now, we need these men, but as soon as it's practical,

1853
01:42:07,355 --> 01:42:09,856
we should sever any such scientists from the program.

1854
01:42:09,857 --> 01:42:11,526
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?

1855
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:15,028
If a Russian bomb is inevitable,

1856
01:42:15,029 --> 01:42:18,131
perhaps we should invite their top scientists to Trinity?

1857
01:42:18,132 --> 01:42:21,868
President Truman has no intention of raising expectations

1858
01:42:21,869 --> 01:42:24,671
that Stalin be included in the atomic project.

1859
01:42:24,672 --> 01:42:26,106
Informing him of our breakthrough

1860
01:42:26,107 --> 01:42:28,308
and presenting it as a means to win the war

1861
01:42:28,309 --> 01:42:30,010
need not make unkeepable promises.

1862
01:42:30,011 --> 01:42:32,179
But the Potsdam peace conference in July

1863
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:36,082
will be President Truman's last chance to have that conversation.

1864
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:38,352
Can you give us a working bomb by then?

1865
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:43,024
Absolutely. We will test fire before the conference.

1866
01:42:47,495 --> 01:42:52,500
Ground Zero, observation posts at 10,000 yards north, south and west.

1867
01:42:53,935 --> 01:42:55,168
Where do we trigger from?

1868
01:42:55,169 --> 01:42:57,103
South, 10,000.

1869
01:42:57,104 --> 01:43:00,373
And Base Camp is ten miles south here.

1870
01:43:00,374 --> 01:43:05,413
And there's a further observation post on... on that hill 20 miles away.

1871
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,848
What's that, Frank? Trigger lines already went in.

1872
01:43:08,849 --> 01:43:12,485
The Air Force requested a line of lights for their B-29.

1873
01:43:12,486 --> 01:43:14,621
What B-29? Our bomb's on the tower.

1874
01:43:14,622 --> 01:43:17,958
They wanna use the test to confirm a safe operating distance.

1875
01:43:17,959 --> 01:43:20,794
- That's risky. - Not as risky as dropping one over Japan

1876
01:43:20,795 --> 01:43:22,829
and hoping that we were right about the blast radius.

1877
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:25,031
Don't let them slow us down. We're firing on the 15th.

1878
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:27,735
The 15th? That's not... The 15th.

1879
01:43:29,270 --> 01:43:30,304
The 15th.

1880
01:43:31,473 --> 01:43:33,573
So I'll be here at South Observation point

1881
01:43:33,574 --> 01:43:35,875
with Frank and Kistiakowsky.

1882
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:39,746
You'll all be assigned to Base Camp, West Observation,

1883
01:43:39,747 --> 01:43:41,682
or Far Observation.

1884
01:43:51,192 --> 01:43:55,029
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Careful with the knife. There, carefully.

1885
01:43:56,530 --> 01:44:00,800
- Are those safe distances? - They're based on your calculations.

1886
01:44:00,801 --> 01:44:03,704
Time to stand behind your science, Hans. Literally.

1887
01:44:27,161 --> 01:44:28,229
Yeah.

1888
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:35,101
What about the radiation cloud?

1889
01:44:35,102 --> 01:44:38,171
Without high winds, it should settle within two to three miles.

1890
01:44:38,172 --> 01:44:40,407
Evacuation measures are in place.

1891
01:44:40,408 --> 01:44:43,711
But we need good weather for visibility, so it has to be fine.

1892
01:44:44,845 --> 01:44:46,347
Everybody out.

1893
01:44:56,457 --> 01:44:58,258
We go on the night of the 15th.

1894
01:44:58,259 --> 01:45:02,295
It's a hard deadline, so if anyone has anything, speak now.

1895
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:04,497
Little, little more. Okay, stop, stop.

1896
01:45:04,498 --> 01:45:08,803
Everybody, mattresses. Put the mattress underneath.

1897
01:45:25,786 --> 01:45:28,622
Could use a final implosion test.

1898
01:45:30,224 --> 01:45:32,893
- It couldn't hurt. - Do it.

1899
01:45:33,861 --> 01:45:36,263
Is there anything else that might stop us?

1900
01:46:10,931 --> 01:46:12,800
It's happening, isn't it?

1901
01:46:14,702 --> 01:46:16,270
I'll send a message.

1902
01:46:16,837 --> 01:46:18,405
If it's gone our way...

1903
01:46:19,874 --> 01:46:21,142
take in the sheets.

1904
01:46:25,246 --> 01:46:26,313
Robert.

1905
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:30,718
Break a leg.

1906
01:46:43,764 --> 01:46:44,999
Okay.

1907
01:47:36,684 --> 01:47:40,053
Oppie's taken a very modest three kilotons.

1908
01:47:40,054 --> 01:47:42,522
- Teller's in with 45. - Twenty.

1909
01:47:42,523 --> 01:47:44,591
20,000 tons of TNT.

1910
01:47:44,592 --> 01:47:48,295
And does anyone want the side action on atmospheric ignition?

1911
01:47:50,631 --> 01:47:54,033
- Are you saying we'll have to delay? - I'm saying it would be prudent.

1912
01:47:54,034 --> 01:47:56,136
This weather, has it reached the site?

1913
01:48:01,275 --> 01:48:03,176
Bethe is calling to tell you the implosion test failed.

1914
01:48:03,177 --> 01:48:06,080
Hello, Hans. Yes, he's here.

1915
01:48:07,281 --> 01:48:08,315
Yes.

1916
01:48:10,651 --> 01:48:12,418
- Is he wrong? - No.

1917
01:48:12,419 --> 01:48:14,288
- No? - No.

1918
01:48:15,055 --> 01:48:17,457
- So we're about to fire a dud? - No.

1919
01:48:17,458 --> 01:48:21,027
- Explain. - Well, I can't. I just... I just know.

1920
01:48:21,028 --> 01:48:22,829
I know the implosion lenses will work.

1921
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:25,064
If we fire these detonators and they don't trigger a reaction,

1922
01:48:25,065 --> 01:48:28,401
two years' worth of plutonium will be scattered across White Sands.

1923
01:48:28,402 --> 01:48:32,006
A month of my salary against ten bucks says it lights.

1924
01:48:32,606 --> 01:48:33,606
Jesus.

1925
01:48:40,481 --> 01:48:42,849
The wind's picking up at Zero, not the rain.

1926
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:44,150
Lightning circling.

1927
01:48:44,151 --> 01:48:45,685
You think it might be time to tell your men

1928
01:48:45,686 --> 01:48:48,689
to get away from the steel tower with the atomic bomb?

1929
01:48:51,659 --> 01:48:54,427
- Let's get to South Observation. - Pull 'em out.

1930
01:48:54,428 --> 01:48:56,964
We can make our determination there.

1931
01:49:01,669 --> 01:49:03,803
The team hasn't slept in two nights.

1932
01:49:03,804 --> 01:49:07,340
If we stand down, make the bomb safe, we won't be back here for weeks.

1933
01:49:07,341 --> 01:49:11,177
Then we'll miss Potsdam. I gotta get word to Truman by 7:00.

1934
01:49:11,178 --> 01:49:13,212
Our window's closing. What is this doing?

1935
01:49:13,213 --> 01:49:14,714
Raining, blowing, lightning.

1936
01:49:14,715 --> 01:49:16,783
- For how long, damn it? - It's holdin' strong.

1937
01:49:16,784 --> 01:49:19,185
It'll break before dawn. How could you know that?

1938
01:49:19,186 --> 01:49:21,254
I know this desert. Storm cools overnight.

1939
01:49:21,255 --> 01:49:23,356
Just before dawn, the storm breaks.

1940
01:49:23,357 --> 01:49:25,758
He could be right, but schedule as late as possible.

1941
01:49:25,759 --> 01:49:27,360
5:30.

1942
01:49:27,361 --> 01:49:29,362
Sign your forecast. If you're wrong, I'll hang you.

1943
01:49:29,363 --> 01:49:31,798
- Frank, tell them all, 5:30. - 5:30.

1944
01:49:31,799 --> 01:49:33,200
5:30. 5:30.

1945
01:49:35,703 --> 01:49:37,503
Three years,

1946
01:49:37,504 --> 01:49:38,838
4,000 people,

1947
01:49:38,839 --> 01:49:40,673
two billion dollars.

1948
01:49:40,674 --> 01:49:42,976
Well, if it doesn't go off,

1949
01:49:42,977 --> 01:49:44,478
we're both finished.

1950
01:49:47,147 --> 01:49:49,716
I'm betting on three kilotons.

1951
01:49:49,717 --> 01:49:52,585
Anything less, they won't get what it is.

1952
01:49:52,586 --> 01:49:56,122
What did Fermi mean by "atmospheric ignition"?

1953
01:49:56,123 --> 01:49:57,857
Well, we had a moment where it looked like

1954
01:49:57,858 --> 01:50:01,562
the chain reaction from an atomic device might never stop.

1955
01:50:02,196 --> 01:50:04,297
Setting fire to the atmosphere.

1956
01:50:04,298 --> 01:50:07,101
Why is Fermi still taking side bets on it?

1957
01:50:07,668 --> 01:50:09,670
Call it gallows humor.

1958
01:50:12,106 --> 01:50:17,043
Wait, are we saying there's a chance that when we push that button,

1959
01:50:17,044 --> 01:50:18,811
we destroy the world?

1960
01:50:18,812 --> 01:50:22,215
Nothing in our research over three years supports that conclusion.

1961
01:50:22,216 --> 01:50:25,285
Except as the most remote possibility.

1962
01:50:26,053 --> 01:50:28,222
- How remote? - Chances are near zero.

1963
01:50:29,657 --> 01:50:30,691
Near zero.

1964
01:50:31,892 --> 01:50:34,395
What do you want from theory alone?

1965
01:50:36,030 --> 01:50:38,165
Zero would be nice.

1966
01:50:41,268 --> 01:50:46,273
In exactly one hour, 58 minutes, we'll know.

1967
01:50:54,081 --> 01:50:55,416
It's letting up.

1968
01:51:07,961 --> 01:51:10,596
The arming party's left Zero, they're heading this way.

1969
01:51:10,597 --> 01:51:11,764
Throwing the switches.

1970
01:51:11,765 --> 01:51:14,902
Turn the cars. Ready for emergency evacuation.

1971
01:51:32,453 --> 01:51:34,087
Take your welder's glass.

1972
01:51:34,088 --> 01:51:36,089
Everybody, take your places.

1973
01:51:36,090 --> 01:51:38,225
Everybody take a welder's glass!

1974
01:51:39,593 --> 01:51:41,695
Everybody take a welder's glass.

1975
01:52:33,180 --> 01:52:34,615
Twenty minutes.

1976
01:52:38,385 --> 01:52:39,720
Twenty minutes.

1977
01:52:50,831 --> 01:52:52,332
That's 20.

1978
01:52:55,269 --> 01:52:57,104
On the leg, please.

1979
01:52:58,238 --> 01:53:00,139
Feynman. No.

1980
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:02,942
For your eyes, sir. The glass stops the UV.

1981
01:53:02,943 --> 01:53:04,711
And what stops the glass?

1982
01:53:06,213 --> 01:53:08,849
I'm gonna head to Base Camp. Best of luck.

1983
01:53:09,583 --> 01:53:11,185
Robert,

1984
01:53:12,119 --> 01:53:13,720
try not to blow up the world.

1985
01:53:25,399 --> 01:53:26,566
Watch that needle.

1986
01:53:26,567 --> 01:53:28,267
If the detonators don't charge,

1987
01:53:28,268 --> 01:53:30,203
or the voltage drops below one volt,

1988
01:53:30,204 --> 01:53:31,871
you hit that button, you abort.

1989
01:53:31,872 --> 01:53:33,606
Understood?

1990
01:53:33,607 --> 01:53:34,808
Understood.

1991
01:53:41,882 --> 01:53:44,383
Two minutes to detonation.

1992
01:53:44,384 --> 01:53:46,185
Everybody down.

1993
01:53:46,186 --> 01:53:50,523
Do not turn around until you see light reflected on the hills.

1994
01:53:50,524 --> 01:53:53,526
Then look at the explosion only through your welder's glass.

1995
01:53:53,527 --> 01:53:55,963
Ninety seconds to detonation.

1996
01:53:57,731 --> 01:54:00,800
Eighty seconds to detonation.

1997
01:54:00,801 --> 01:54:02,369
Is it rubbed in?

1998
01:54:02,936 --> 01:54:04,171
Yeah.

1999
01:54:10,644 --> 01:54:13,814
Sixty seconds to detonation.

2000
01:54:28,428 --> 01:54:30,630
These things are hard on your heart.

2001
01:54:30,631 --> 01:54:32,266
Thirty seconds.

2002
01:54:37,471 --> 01:54:38,905
Detonator's charged.

2003
01:54:49,149 --> 01:54:53,519
17, 16, 15...

2004
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:58,558
14, 13, 12, 11...

2005
01:55:00,661 --> 01:55:01,828
Ten...

2006
01:55:03,130 --> 01:55:05,197
...nine,

2007
01:55:05,198 --> 01:55:06,600
eight...

2008
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:08,602
seven...

2009
01:55:09,903 --> 01:55:11,371
six...

2010
01:55:12,306 --> 01:55:13,540
five...

2011
01:55:15,375 --> 01:55:16,677
four...

2012
01:55:18,178 --> 01:55:19,546
three...

2013
01:55:20,147 --> 01:55:21,515
two...

2014
01:55:22,983 --> 01:55:24,284
one.

2015
01:56:56,743 --> 01:56:59,312
"And now I am become Death."

2016
01:57:01,548 --> 01:57:03,483
"The destroyer of worlds."

2017
01:57:36,850 --> 01:57:37,884
It worked.

2018
01:58:13,386 --> 01:58:15,388
You owe me ten dollars! Oh!

2019
01:58:17,524 --> 01:58:18,791
Come on!

2020
01:58:18,792 --> 01:58:21,327
I... I'm good for it, Kisty.

2021
01:58:21,328 --> 01:58:22,662
You are.

2022
01:58:23,230 --> 01:58:25,365
Yes, you are!

2023
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:56,029
We did it! Well done.

2024
01:59:01,902 --> 01:59:03,904
Get me Potsdam right away.

2025
01:59:15,081 --> 01:59:17,850
Get a message to Kitty. We can't say anything.

2026
01:59:17,851 --> 01:59:19,753
Tell her to take in the sheets.

2027
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:34,935
Shh.

2028
01:59:34,936 --> 01:59:36,669
- Hello? - Hi. Kitty?

2029
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:39,638
What... What? Charlotte. Charlotte, go ahead, go ahead.

2030
01:59:39,639 --> 01:59:44,544
Oh, um, well, I don't know, he just said to tell you to "bring in the sheets."

2031
01:59:47,247 --> 01:59:48,481
Kitty?

2032
01:59:49,816 --> 01:59:52,619
Kitty? Kitty, are you still there?

2033
01:59:59,326 --> 02:00:02,595
If they detonate it too high in the air, the blast won't be as powerful.

2034
02:00:02,596 --> 02:00:04,997
With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer,

2035
02:00:04,998 --> 02:00:06,700
we'll take it from here.

2036
02:00:16,943 --> 02:00:19,912
Did Truman brief Stalin at Potsdam?

2037
02:00:19,913 --> 02:00:22,581
A brief would be an overstatement.

2038
02:00:22,582 --> 02:00:26,885
He referred to a powerful new weapon.

2039
02:00:26,886 --> 02:00:31,924
Stalin hoped we'd use it against Japan.

2040
02:00:33,159 --> 02:00:34,660
That's it?

2041
02:00:34,661 --> 02:00:36,595
Robert, we've given them an ace,

2042
02:00:36,596 --> 02:00:38,565
it's for them to play the hand.

2043
02:00:40,333 --> 02:00:42,134
You're aiming for the 6th?

2044
02:00:42,135 --> 02:00:44,871
Well, it's up to the CO in the Pacific.

2045
02:00:46,072 --> 02:00:48,008
Should I come with you to Washington?

2046
02:00:49,609 --> 02:00:50,944
What for?

2047
02:00:53,113 --> 02:00:54,981
Well, you'll keep me informed.

2048
02:00:56,216 --> 02:00:57,250
Of course.

2049
02:00:59,419 --> 02:01:00,687
As best I can.

2050
02:01:18,505 --> 02:01:21,675
Would the Japanese surrender if they knew what was coming?

2051
02:01:22,642 --> 02:01:24,044
I don't know.

2052
02:01:26,413 --> 02:01:28,447
Have you seen Szilard's petition?

2053
02:01:28,448 --> 02:01:31,016
What the hell does Szilard know about the Japanese?

2054
02:01:31,017 --> 02:01:32,552
You're not signing it, are you?

2055
02:01:33,353 --> 02:01:35,954
Many people have. A lot of people have.

2056
02:01:35,955 --> 02:01:37,157
Edward,

2057
02:01:38,491 --> 02:01:39,892
the fact that we built this bomb

2058
02:01:39,893 --> 02:01:42,995
does not give us any more right or responsibility

2059
02:01:42,996 --> 02:01:45,230
to decide how it's used than anyone else.

2060
02:01:45,231 --> 02:01:47,333
But we're the only people who know about it.

2061
02:01:47,334 --> 02:01:50,969
I've told Stimson the various opinions of the community.

2062
02:01:50,970 --> 02:01:52,305
But what's your opinion?

2063
02:01:53,773 --> 02:01:55,175
Once it's used...

2064
02:01:56,176 --> 02:02:00,046
nuclear war, perhaps all war...

2065
02:02:01,481 --> 02:02:02,881
becomes unthinkable.

2066
02:02:02,882 --> 02:02:05,852
Until somebody builds a bigger bomb.

2067
02:02:26,606 --> 02:02:28,307
I thought they would call.

2068
02:02:28,308 --> 02:02:29,943
It's only the 5th.

2069
02:02:32,112 --> 02:02:34,080
In Japan, it's the 6th.

2070
02:02:47,093 --> 02:02:48,128
Charlotte.

2071
02:02:50,597 --> 02:02:52,198
Try Groves.

2072
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:54,234
Anything?

2073
02:02:56,302 --> 02:02:57,770
Charlotte?

2074
02:02:57,771 --> 02:02:59,272
Truman's on the radio.

2075
02:03:00,206 --> 02:03:02,841
Sixteen hours ago,

2076
02:03:02,842 --> 02:03:07,880
an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima...

2077
02:03:10,083 --> 02:03:13,253
...and destroyed its usefulness to the enemy.

2078
02:03:15,121 --> 02:03:20,159
The bomb had more power than 20,000 tons of TNT.

2079
02:03:23,129 --> 02:03:25,098
It is an atomic bomb.

2080
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:32,739
It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe.

2081
02:03:34,808 --> 02:03:36,041
Groves on one.

2082
02:03:36,042 --> 02:03:37,876
We are now prepared to destroy,

2083
02:03:37,877 --> 02:03:41,313
more rapidly and completely, the Japanese...

2084
02:03:41,314 --> 02:03:43,182
General?

2085
02:03:43,183 --> 02:03:46,285
I'm very proud of you and all of your people.

2086
02:03:46,286 --> 02:03:47,753
It went all right?

2087
02:03:47,754 --> 02:03:50,156
Apparently, it went with a tremendous bang.

2088
02:03:51,224 --> 02:03:55,295
Well, everyone here is feeling reasonably good about it.

2089
02:03:56,996 --> 02:03:58,530
It's been a long road.

2090
02:03:58,531 --> 02:04:01,133
I think one of the wisest things I ever did

2091
02:04:01,134 --> 02:04:03,803
was when I selected the director of Los Alamos.

2092
02:04:06,506 --> 02:04:10,576
We have spent more than two billion dollars

2093
02:04:10,577 --> 02:04:14,581
on the greatest scientific gamble in history,

2094
02:04:15,115 --> 02:04:17,250
and we have won.

2095
02:04:21,688 --> 02:04:25,157
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2096
02:04:25,158 --> 02:04:33,158
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2097
02:05:45,405 --> 02:05:46,572
The world...

2098
02:05:48,241 --> 02:05:49,642
will remember this day.

2099
02:06:08,962 --> 02:06:10,829
It's too soon to...

2100
02:06:10,830 --> 02:06:15,101
It's too soon to determine what the results of the bombing are.

2101
02:06:17,737 --> 02:06:19,806
But I'll bet the Japanese didn't like it.

2102
02:06:40,693 --> 02:06:42,362
I'm so proud.

2103
02:06:43,196 --> 02:06:45,164
So proud of what you have accomplished.

2104
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:55,575
I just wish we had it in time to use against the Germans.

2105
02:08:45,318 --> 02:08:47,019
Dr. Oppenheimer?

2106
02:08:47,887 --> 02:08:49,054
Dr. Oppenheimer?

2107
02:08:49,055 --> 02:08:51,324
Nice picture.

2108
02:08:52,024 --> 02:08:54,026
President Truman will see you now.

2109
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:10,876
Dr. Oppenheimer. It's an honor.

2110
02:09:10,877 --> 02:09:12,844
Mr. President. Please.

2111
02:09:12,845 --> 02:09:14,213
Thank you.

2112
02:09:14,714 --> 02:09:16,048
Secretary Byrnes.

2113
02:09:18,151 --> 02:09:21,354
How's it feel to be the most famous man in the world?

2114
02:09:22,221 --> 02:09:25,457
You helped save a lot of American lives.

2115
02:09:25,458 --> 02:09:29,629
What we did at Hiroshima was a... And Nagasaki.

2116
02:09:30,797 --> 02:09:32,664
Well, obviously.

2117
02:09:32,665 --> 02:09:36,001
Your invention let us bring our boys home.

2118
02:09:36,002 --> 02:09:38,170
Well, it was hardly...

2119
02:09:38,171 --> 02:09:39,371
my invention.

2120
02:09:39,372 --> 02:09:41,407
It was you on the cover of Time.

2121
02:09:44,243 --> 02:09:47,846
Jim tells me you're concerned about an arms race with the Soviets.

2122
02:09:47,847 --> 02:09:49,515
Oh, yes, uh...

2123
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:52,217
Well, um...

2124
02:09:52,218 --> 02:09:53,552
It's that, uh,

2125
02:09:53,553 --> 02:09:57,556
now is our chance to secure...

2126
02:09:57,557 --> 02:10:00,492
international cooperation on... ...atomic energy

2127
02:10:00,493 --> 02:10:02,694
a-a-and I'm concerned...

2128
02:10:02,695 --> 02:10:05,664
Do you know when the Soviets are gonna have the bomb?

2129
02:10:05,665 --> 02:10:07,799
I don't think I could give a precise...

2130
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:09,268
Never.

2131
02:10:09,902 --> 02:10:11,369
Never.

2132
02:10:11,370 --> 02:10:14,673
Mr. President, the Russians have good physicists

2133
02:10:14,674 --> 02:10:17,375
a-a-and abundant resources. Abundant?

2134
02:10:17,376 --> 02:10:18,644
Yes.

2135
02:10:19,312 --> 02:10:21,279
I don't think so.

2136
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:25,184
Well, they'll put everything they have in...

2137
02:10:28,621 --> 02:10:33,458
I hear you're leaving Los Alamos.

2138
02:10:33,459 --> 02:10:34,926
What should we do with it?

2139
02:10:34,927 --> 02:10:37,296
Give it back to the Indians.

2140
02:10:44,804 --> 02:10:47,839
Um, Dr. Oppenheimer,

2141
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:51,009
if what you say about the Soviets is true,

2142
02:10:51,010 --> 02:10:55,548
we have to build up Los Alamos, not shut it down.

2143
02:10:59,085 --> 02:11:00,786
Mr. President...

2144
02:11:01,921 --> 02:11:03,256
Um...

2145
02:11:06,092 --> 02:11:09,895
I feel that I have blood on my hands.

2146
02:11:29,448 --> 02:11:34,453
You think anyone in Hiroshima or Nagasaki

2147
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:37,890
gives a shit who built the bomb?

2148
02:11:41,127 --> 02:11:43,663
They care who dropped it.

2149
02:11:44,263 --> 02:11:45,498
I did.

2150
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:50,803
Hiroshima isn't about you.

2151
02:11:57,143 --> 02:11:58,611
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2152
02:12:09,889 --> 02:12:12,491
Don't let that crybaby back in here.

2153
02:12:17,763 --> 02:12:20,832
Robert saw that hand-wringing got him nowhere.

2154
02:12:20,833 --> 02:12:23,902
By the time I met him, he'd fully embraced

2155
02:12:23,903 --> 02:12:26,738
his "father of the bomb" reputation.

2156
02:12:26,739 --> 02:12:29,275
And he used his profile to influence policy.

2157
02:12:37,950 --> 02:12:40,018
Doctor, in the years following the war,

2158
02:12:40,019 --> 02:12:42,354
would you say that you exerted a great influence

2159
02:12:42,355 --> 02:12:44,122
on the atomic policies of the USA?

2160
02:12:44,123 --> 02:12:46,825
I think "great" would be an overstatement.

2161
02:12:46,826 --> 02:12:49,060
Really? If we look at the issue of isotopes,

2162
02:12:49,061 --> 02:12:52,530
were you not personally responsible for destroying all opposition to their export?

2163
02:12:52,531 --> 02:12:55,133
You could use a bottle of beer...

2164
02:12:55,134 --> 02:12:56,334
...when making atomic weapons.

2165
02:12:56,335 --> 02:12:57,402
In fact, you do.

2166
02:12:57,403 --> 02:12:58,770
I was the spokesman,

2167
02:12:58,771 --> 02:13:01,239
but the opinion among scientists was unanimous.

2168
02:13:01,240 --> 02:13:04,744
All along with McCarthy on the rise, he knew he was vulnerable.

2169
02:13:05,478 --> 02:13:06,678
His brother was blacklisted

2170
02:13:06,679 --> 02:13:09,415
by every university in the country.

2171
02:13:10,583 --> 02:13:13,919
Lomanitz wound up working the railroad, laying track.

2172
02:13:15,454 --> 02:13:17,890
And Chevalier went into exile.

2173
02:13:19,525 --> 02:13:23,461
But none of that stopped Robert from pushing the GAC

2174
02:13:23,462 --> 02:13:26,065
to recommend arms control instead of the H-bomb.

2175
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:31,737
He was devastated when Truman rejected their recommendation.

2176
02:13:33,606 --> 02:13:35,373
I miss Richard more than I can bear.

2177
02:13:35,374 --> 02:13:37,242
I know, Ruth, I know.

2178
02:13:37,243 --> 02:13:40,946
Part of me's glad he didn't live to see where this is all going.

2179
02:13:43,749 --> 02:13:46,785
Here comes the birthday boy. To gloat.

2180
02:13:46,786 --> 02:13:47,853
Have fun.

2181
02:13:48,754 --> 02:13:50,755
Robert, uh, my son and his fiancée

2182
02:13:50,756 --> 02:13:53,291
are desperate to meet the father of the atomic bomb, and so...

2183
02:13:53,292 --> 02:13:55,628
Well... good day.

2184
02:14:02,435 --> 02:14:04,235
Is this a bad time?

2185
02:14:04,236 --> 02:14:05,703
What do you think, Lewis?

2186
02:14:05,704 --> 02:14:08,373
Well, I think it must have been a blow for you.

2187
02:14:08,374 --> 02:14:09,675
For the world.

2188
02:14:10,943 --> 02:14:14,380
The world? What does Fuchs mean to the rest of the world?

2189
02:14:15,781 --> 02:14:17,148
Fuchs?

2190
02:14:17,149 --> 02:14:18,717
Klaus Fuchs?

2191
02:14:20,219 --> 02:14:22,621
Oh, dear. You haven't heard.

2192
02:14:25,558 --> 02:14:27,625
Klaus Fuchs, the British scientist

2193
02:14:27,626 --> 02:14:30,662
that you put onto the implosion team at Los Alamos,

2194
02:14:30,663 --> 02:14:35,701
turns out he was spying for the Soviets the whole time.

2195
02:14:36,268 --> 02:14:37,670
I'm sorry.

2196
02:14:42,975 --> 02:14:45,844
After the truth about Fuchs came out,

2197
02:14:45,845 --> 02:14:48,113
the FBI stepped up surveillance on him.

2198
02:14:48,114 --> 02:14:50,648
He knew his phone was tapped,

2199
02:14:50,649 --> 02:14:52,718
he was followed everywhere,

2200
02:14:53,352 --> 02:14:55,087
his trash picked through.

2201
02:14:58,023 --> 02:15:02,227
- But never stopped speaking his mind. - A man of conviction.

2202
02:15:02,228 --> 02:15:05,631
And maybe he thought fame could actually protect him.

2203
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:10,736
When Eisenhower took office, he saw one more chance.

2204
02:15:11,604 --> 02:15:13,271
He took it.

2205
02:15:13,272 --> 02:15:18,310
America and Russia may be likened to two scorpions in a bottle,

2206
02:15:19,845 --> 02:15:23,414
each capable of killing the other,

2207
02:15:23,415 --> 02:15:26,084
but only at the risk of his own life.

2208
02:15:26,085 --> 02:15:28,853
Now, there are various aspects of this policy...

2209
02:15:28,854 --> 02:15:30,955
Lot of scientists blame me,

2210
02:15:30,956 --> 02:15:33,925
but how was I supposed to protect him?

2211
02:15:33,926 --> 02:15:37,328
...are too secret for discussion, candor is the only remedy.

2212
02:15:37,329 --> 02:15:41,267
Officials in Washington need to start leveling with the American people.

2213
02:15:42,902 --> 02:15:45,703
That was the last straw for Robert's enemies.

2214
02:15:45,704 --> 02:15:47,772
So he had to lose his security clearance?

2215
02:15:47,773 --> 02:15:50,508
And with it, his credibility.

2216
02:15:50,509 --> 02:15:52,577
But how could they do it?

2217
02:15:52,578 --> 02:15:56,114
He was a war hero. He'd already told everyone about his past.

2218
02:15:56,115 --> 02:15:58,149
Borden dredged it all up.

2219
02:15:58,150 --> 02:16:01,352
How could Borden get access to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

2220
02:16:01,353 --> 02:16:05,456
Could it have been Nichols? No, I can't imagine he'd do that.

2221
02:16:05,457 --> 02:16:07,325
But whoever did unleashed a firestorm

2222
02:16:07,326 --> 02:16:12,364
that burned a path from the White House back to my desk at the AEC.

2223
02:16:12,464 --> 02:16:14,199
You see him in there, right?

2224
02:16:14,967 --> 02:16:17,802
I've worked my whole life to get here,

2225
02:16:17,803 --> 02:16:19,837
Cabinet of the United States of America,

2226
02:16:19,838 --> 02:16:23,943
and now, in front of the entire country, they're gonna put me back in my place.

2227
02:16:25,578 --> 02:16:27,845
A lowly shoe salesman.

2228
02:16:27,846 --> 02:16:30,014
Lewis, we can win this thing.

2229
02:16:30,015 --> 02:16:33,351
I-I think we can get the Senate to grasp that you did your duty,

2230
02:16:33,352 --> 02:16:35,053
painful though it was.

2231
02:16:35,054 --> 02:16:37,355
Now, will Hill's testimony back us up? Hill will be fine.

2232
02:16:37,356 --> 02:16:40,925
I don't really know him, but he was one of Szilard's boys in Chicago,

2233
02:16:40,926 --> 02:16:42,427
and they never forgave Robert

2234
02:16:42,428 --> 02:16:45,097
for not supporting the petition against bombing Japan.

2235
02:16:46,365 --> 02:16:50,335
This was taken 31 days after the bombing.

2236
02:16:50,336 --> 02:16:55,374
Virtually everyone in the street for nearly a mile around

2237
02:16:55,574 --> 02:16:58,744
was instantly and seriously burned.

2238
02:17:00,479 --> 02:17:04,749
The Japanese spoke of people who wore striped clothing

2239
02:17:04,750 --> 02:17:07,720
upon whom the skin was burned in stripes.

2240
02:17:08,621 --> 02:17:11,089
There were many who thought themselves lucky,

2241
02:17:11,090 --> 02:17:15,260
who climbed out of the ruins of their homes, only slightly injured.

2242
02:17:16,829 --> 02:17:18,963
But they died anyway.

2243
02:17:18,964 --> 02:17:23,534
They died days or weeks later from the radium-like rays

2244
02:17:23,535 --> 02:17:27,906
emitted in great numbers at the moment of the explosion.

2245
02:17:28,941 --> 02:17:31,042
Did you read this crap in the papers?

2246
02:17:31,043 --> 02:17:33,111
A British physicist is saying

2247
02:17:33,112 --> 02:17:36,114
the atomic bombings were not the last act of World War II,

2248
02:17:36,115 --> 02:17:39,284
but the first act of this cold war with Russia.

2249
02:17:39,285 --> 02:17:40,685
Which physicist?

2250
02:17:40,686 --> 02:17:43,689
I think you knew him. Patrick Blackett.

2251
02:17:46,325 --> 02:17:47,792
He may not be wrong.

2252
02:17:47,793 --> 02:17:49,227
Stimson is now telling me

2253
02:17:49,228 --> 02:17:52,630
we bombed an enemy that was essentially defeated.

2254
02:17:52,631 --> 02:17:55,300
Robert, you've all the influence now.

2255
02:17:56,135 --> 02:17:57,402
Please.

2256
02:17:57,403 --> 02:17:59,904
Urge them to continue my research on the Super.

2257
02:17:59,905 --> 02:18:02,273
I neither can nor will, Edward.

2258
02:18:02,274 --> 02:18:03,641
Why not?

2259
02:18:03,642 --> 02:18:05,643
It's not the right use of our resources.

2260
02:18:05,644 --> 02:18:07,178
Is that what you really believe?

2261
02:18:07,179 --> 02:18:12,184
J. Robert Oppenheimer. Sphinx-like guru of the atom.

2262
02:18:13,419 --> 02:18:15,154
Nobody knows what you believe.

2263
02:18:16,288 --> 02:18:18,289
Do you? Hmm?

2264
02:18:18,290 --> 02:18:20,925
One final time, our program director,

2265
02:18:20,926 --> 02:18:22,928
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

2266
02:18:24,229 --> 02:18:26,431
I hope that, in years to come,

2267
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:29,701
you will look back on your work here with pride.

2268
02:18:29,702 --> 02:18:34,406
But today that pride must be tempered with a profound concern.

2269
02:18:35,841 --> 02:18:40,278
If atomic weapons are to be added to the arsenals of a warring world,

2270
02:18:40,279 --> 02:18:45,317
then the day will come when people will curse the name of Los Alamos.

2271
02:18:49,722 --> 02:18:52,624
Sorry, Admiral. Stopped off to get this.

2272
02:18:53,525 --> 02:18:56,094
It seems pretty favorable.

2273
02:18:56,095 --> 02:18:58,730
There's Oppenheimer. What's the caption?

2274
02:18:58,731 --> 02:19:01,834
Uh, "J. Robert Oppenheimer, Strauss fought...

2275
02:19:03,469 --> 02:19:04,903
and the US won."

2276
02:19:05,804 --> 02:19:07,071
That'll work.

2277
02:19:07,072 --> 02:19:09,407
Those were your words from the other day.

2278
02:19:09,408 --> 02:19:11,075
We needed to pivot.

2279
02:19:11,076 --> 02:19:13,878
But how would you know what Time magazine's gonna write?

2280
02:19:13,879 --> 02:19:16,181
Henry Luce is a friend.

2281
02:19:23,355 --> 02:19:26,290
You sat here and let me tell you how it's done,

2282
02:19:26,291 --> 02:19:28,659
but you've been far ahead all along.

2283
02:19:28,660 --> 02:19:31,829
Survival in Washington

2284
02:19:31,830 --> 02:19:34,266
is about knowing how to get things done.

2285
02:19:34,633 --> 02:19:35,868
Right.

2286
02:19:37,736 --> 02:19:39,437
What was it you said about Borden?

2287
02:19:39,438 --> 02:19:41,974
"Why get caught holding the knife yourself?"

2288
02:19:43,642 --> 02:19:47,112
I'm beginning to think Borden was holding the knife for you.

2289
02:19:49,114 --> 02:19:53,685
It's gonna come down to how much influence Borden's been able to exert on Teller.

2290
02:19:54,887 --> 02:19:56,687
Did I say something funny?

2291
02:19:56,688 --> 02:20:00,858
Just "Borden, Borden, Borden" when we all know that it's Strauss.

2292
02:20:00,859 --> 02:20:03,294
Lewis brought me to Princeton, Kitty.

2293
02:20:03,295 --> 02:20:06,130
And then you humiliated him in front of Congress.

2294
02:20:06,131 --> 02:20:09,001
But more useful than a sandwich.

2295
02:20:11,970 --> 02:20:13,205
How'd I do?

2296
02:20:14,173 --> 02:20:16,040
Maybe a little too well, Robert.

2297
02:20:16,041 --> 02:20:17,542
That was six years ago.

2298
02:20:17,543 --> 02:20:21,245
You know the truly vindictive, patient as saints.

2299
02:20:21,246 --> 02:20:24,048
Strauss has been perfectly clear that he is neutral.

2300
02:20:24,049 --> 02:20:27,485
Wake up! It is Strauss!

2301
02:20:27,486 --> 02:20:30,721
It's always been Strauss, and you know it.

2302
02:20:30,722 --> 02:20:32,491
Why won't you fight him?

2303
02:20:33,025 --> 02:20:34,259
Christ's sake.

2304
02:20:35,461 --> 02:20:39,330
It wasn't Nichols, or Hoover, or one of Truman's guys.

2305
02:20:39,331 --> 02:20:41,899
It was you. You gave the file to Borden.

2306
02:20:41,900 --> 02:20:44,202
You set him on Oppenheimer. You convinced him to...

2307
02:20:44,203 --> 02:20:48,806
Borden didn't take any convincing.

2308
02:20:48,807 --> 02:20:50,541
Take your time, use the entire file.

2309
02:20:50,542 --> 02:20:52,877
Write up your conclusions, send them to the FBI.

2310
02:20:52,878 --> 02:20:57,415
The material is obviously extensive, but there's nothing new here.

2311
02:20:57,416 --> 02:20:59,750
Your conclusions will be.

2312
02:20:59,751 --> 02:21:01,853
And they'll have to be answered.

2313
02:21:01,854 --> 02:21:03,521
Hoover passes them to McCarthy?

2314
02:21:03,522 --> 02:21:06,891
Oppenheimer's too slippery for that self-promoting clown.

2315
02:21:06,892 --> 02:21:09,994
I've talked it over with Hoover, he'll hold McCarthy at bay

2316
02:21:09,995 --> 02:21:11,796
while you do this with the AEC.

2317
02:21:11,797 --> 02:21:12,964
A trial.

2318
02:21:12,965 --> 02:21:14,265
No. No trial.

2319
02:21:14,266 --> 02:21:17,134
You can't give Oppenheimer a platform.

2320
02:21:17,135 --> 02:21:18,870
You can't martyr him.

2321
02:21:18,871 --> 02:21:22,340
We need a systematic destruction of Oppenheimer's credibility

2322
02:21:22,341 --> 02:21:26,078
so he can never again speak on matters of national security.

2323
02:21:26,678 --> 02:21:27,913
Then what?

2324
02:21:29,214 --> 02:21:32,684
A shabby little room, far from the limelight.

2325
02:21:38,290 --> 02:21:40,358
A simple, bureaucratic procedure.

2326
02:21:40,359 --> 02:21:42,894
His Q clearance is up for renewal.

2327
02:21:42,895 --> 02:21:45,864
You send your accusations to the FBI...

2328
02:21:47,666 --> 02:21:50,968
Hoover sends them to the AEC, you're forced to act.

2329
02:21:50,969 --> 02:21:53,004
You write up an indictment.

2330
02:21:53,005 --> 02:21:57,241
You tell Oppenheimer his security clearance is not being renewed.

2331
02:21:57,242 --> 02:21:59,277
But offer him the chance to appeal.

2332
02:21:59,278 --> 02:22:01,779
As you can see, Robert, it's not yet signed.

2333
02:22:01,780 --> 02:22:03,915
May I keep this? No.

2334
02:22:03,916 --> 02:22:07,952
If you do decide to appeal, they'll have to send you a copy.

2335
02:22:07,953 --> 02:22:11,722
When he appeals, and trust me, he will,

2336
02:22:11,723 --> 02:22:13,791
I appoint a board.

2337
02:22:13,792 --> 02:22:16,427
They will, of course, have counsel.

2338
02:22:16,428 --> 02:22:18,429
- Prosecutor? - In all but name.

2339
02:22:18,430 --> 02:22:20,431
Who? Roger Robb.

2340
02:22:20,432 --> 02:22:22,033
Ouch.

2341
02:22:22,034 --> 02:22:24,735
Robb will have security clearance to examine Oppenheimer's file.

2342
02:22:24,736 --> 02:22:26,070
As will the Gray board.

2343
02:22:26,071 --> 02:22:27,539
Defense counsel will not.

2344
02:22:28,540 --> 02:22:30,107
A closed hearing.

2345
02:22:30,108 --> 02:22:34,211
"The so-called and derogatory information in your indictment of me..."

2346
02:22:34,212 --> 02:22:38,116
No audience. No reporters. No burden of proof.

2347
02:22:38,584 --> 02:22:40,185
No burden of proof?

2348
02:22:41,653 --> 02:22:43,021
We're not convicting.

2349
02:22:43,855 --> 02:22:45,590
We're just denying.

2350
02:22:51,196 --> 02:22:54,031
What is it you said?

2351
02:22:54,032 --> 02:22:57,569
"This is just how the game is played."

2352
02:22:58,103 --> 02:23:00,404
Well, forgive my naivete.

2353
02:23:00,405 --> 02:23:04,409
Amateurs seek the sun... get eaten.

2354
02:23:05,644 --> 02:23:08,512
Power stays in the shadows.

2355
02:23:08,513 --> 02:23:11,549
But, sir, you're out of the shadows now.

2356
02:23:11,550 --> 02:23:13,784
Yeah, that's why this has to work.

2357
02:23:13,785 --> 02:23:15,187
Well...

2358
02:23:16,521 --> 02:23:19,490
Teller's testifying this morning. That'll help.

2359
02:23:19,491 --> 02:23:20,958
And then...

2360
02:23:20,959 --> 02:23:22,326
Hill is in the afternoon.

2361
02:23:22,327 --> 02:23:24,296
Hill is gonna help us too.

2362
02:23:26,932 --> 02:23:30,334
As you can see, Robert, it's not yet signed.

2363
02:23:30,335 --> 02:23:32,337
- May I keep this? - No.

2364
02:23:34,506 --> 02:23:39,511
If you do decide to appeal, then they'll have to send you a copy.

2365
02:23:43,015 --> 02:23:45,317
Take my car and driver. I insist.

2366
02:23:49,988 --> 02:23:51,989
I'll have to consult my lawyers, Lewis.

2367
02:23:51,990 --> 02:23:54,825
Of course. But don't take too long.

2368
02:23:54,826 --> 02:23:57,129
I can't keep Nichols at bay.

2369
02:24:03,101 --> 02:24:05,302
I'm sorry it's come to this, Robert.

2370
02:24:05,303 --> 02:24:07,139
I think it's wrong.

2371
02:24:19,551 --> 02:24:23,354
Nichols wants me to fight so he can get it all on the record.

2372
02:24:23,355 --> 02:24:25,289
Strauss wants me to walk away.

2373
02:24:25,290 --> 02:24:30,328
Strauss knows that you can't do that. You'd be accepting the charges.

2374
02:24:30,729 --> 02:24:32,229
You'll lose your job.

2375
02:24:32,230 --> 02:24:35,199
You will lose your reputation. We'll lose our house.

2376
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:37,202
Robert, we have to fight.

2377
02:24:39,838 --> 02:24:43,841
As AEC counsel, I can't represent you. I'll call Lloyd Garrison.

2378
02:24:43,842 --> 02:24:46,678
- He's good. - The best, but...

2379
02:24:47,646 --> 02:24:48,980
I have to warn you,

2380
02:24:49,848 --> 02:24:52,349
this won't be a fair fight.

2381
02:24:52,350 --> 02:24:55,052
During your interview with Boris Pash in 1943,

2382
02:24:55,053 --> 02:24:56,620
did you refer to microfilm?

2383
02:24:56,621 --> 02:24:59,824
- No. - Tab 11, page one, paragraph three.

2384
02:24:59,825 --> 02:25:03,427
You never said, "Man of the consulate expert in the use of microfilm."

2385
02:25:03,428 --> 02:25:05,062
- I'm sorry. - No.

2386
02:25:05,063 --> 02:25:07,298
I would like to know what document Mr. Robb is quoting from

2387
02:25:07,299 --> 02:25:08,766
and if we might be furnished with a copy.

2388
02:25:08,767 --> 02:25:10,668
The document is classified, Mr. Garrison.

2389
02:25:10,669 --> 02:25:13,070
I think we should get back to firsthand information.

2390
02:25:13,071 --> 02:25:16,074
- This is firsthand. - How so, Roger?

2391
02:25:17,609 --> 02:25:19,344
There was a recording of the interview.

2392
02:25:23,749 --> 02:25:26,717
You let my client sit here and potentially perjure himself

2393
02:25:26,718 --> 02:25:29,153
and all this time, you had a recording?

2394
02:25:29,154 --> 02:25:32,123
Nobody told your client to misrepresent his former answers.

2395
02:25:32,124 --> 02:25:34,291
Misrepres... It was 12 years ago.

2396
02:25:34,292 --> 02:25:35,693
Can we hear this recording?

2397
02:25:35,694 --> 02:25:37,561
You don't have the clearance, Mr. Garrison.

2398
02:25:37,562 --> 02:25:40,030
- But you're reading it into the record. - Please, please.

2399
02:25:40,031 --> 02:25:43,968
Is this proceeding interested in entrapment or in truth?

2400
02:25:43,969 --> 02:25:47,905
If it's truth, where's the disclosure? Where's the witness list?

2401
02:25:47,906 --> 02:25:50,741
Mr. Garrison, this isn't a trial, as you're well aware.

2402
02:25:50,742 --> 02:25:55,146
Evidentiary rules do not apply. We are dealing with national security.

2403
02:25:55,147 --> 02:25:56,814
Yes, sir, with all due respect,

2404
02:25:56,815 --> 02:25:59,750
I fail to see how national security prevents the prosecution

2405
02:25:59,751 --> 02:26:01,318
from providing us a list of witnesses.

2406
02:26:01,319 --> 02:26:03,087
Perhaps we are in need of a brief recess.

2407
02:26:03,088 --> 02:26:04,889
Gentlemen, you have my words.

2408
02:26:04,890 --> 02:26:07,792
If you say they're from a transcript, then I'll accept it.

2409
02:26:07,793 --> 02:26:10,628
I've already explained I made up a cock-and-bull story.

2410
02:26:10,629 --> 02:26:13,964
But why would anyone make up such an elaborate story?

2411
02:26:13,965 --> 02:26:15,600
Because I was an idiot.

2412
02:26:16,134 --> 02:26:18,002
Why lie?

2413
02:26:18,003 --> 02:26:21,672
Well, clearly with the intention of not revealing who the intermediary was.

2414
02:26:21,673 --> 02:26:24,375
Your friend, Haakon Chevalier, the communist?

2415
02:26:24,376 --> 02:26:25,844
Is he still your friend?

2416
02:26:26,812 --> 02:26:28,079
Yes.

2417
02:26:30,849 --> 02:26:33,184
Dr. Rabi, thank you for coming.

2418
02:26:33,185 --> 02:26:35,085
Do you know who else the prosecution has called?

2419
02:26:35,086 --> 02:26:37,422
Teller, obviously.

2420
02:26:38,290 --> 02:26:40,591
- They've asked Lawrence. - What did he say?

2421
02:26:40,592 --> 02:26:43,894
- He wasn't going to help them, but... - But?

2422
02:26:43,895 --> 02:26:48,933
Strauss told him that you and Ruth Tolman have been having an affair for years.

2423
02:26:48,934 --> 02:26:51,502
The whole time you lived with them in Pasadena.

2424
02:26:51,503 --> 02:26:55,072
He convinced Lawrence that Richard died of a broken heart.

2425
02:26:55,073 --> 02:26:57,007
- That's absurd. - What part?

2426
02:26:57,008 --> 02:26:58,742
The broken heart.

2427
02:26:58,743 --> 02:27:00,212
Richard never found out.

2428
02:27:01,279 --> 02:27:02,780
Is Lawrence gonna testify?

2429
02:27:02,781 --> 02:27:04,415
I don't know.

2430
02:27:04,416 --> 02:27:09,253
Dr. Rabi, what governmental positions do you currently hold?

2431
02:27:09,254 --> 02:27:13,424
I am the chairman of the General Advisory Committee to the AEC,

2432
02:27:13,425 --> 02:27:15,326
succeeding Dr. Oppenheimer.

2433
02:27:15,327 --> 02:27:17,696
And how long have you known Dr. Oppenheimer?

2434
02:27:18,230 --> 02:27:20,464
Since 1928. I...

2435
02:27:20,465 --> 02:27:22,199
I know him quite well.

2436
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:26,637
Well enough to speak to the bearing of his loyalty and character?

2437
02:27:26,638 --> 02:27:30,674
Dr. Oppenheimer is a man of upstanding character.

2438
02:27:30,675 --> 02:27:34,545
And he is loyal to the United States, to his friends,

2439
02:27:34,546 --> 02:27:37,215
to the institutions of which he is part.

2440
02:27:38,850 --> 02:27:40,285
Eat.

2441
02:27:58,870 --> 02:28:01,506
- What was that? - Nothing to worry about.

2442
02:28:04,876 --> 02:28:06,577
After the Russian A-bomb test,

2443
02:28:06,578 --> 02:28:09,213
did Dr. Lawrence come to see you about the hydrogen bomb?

2444
02:28:09,214 --> 02:28:10,948
You'd be better off asking him.

2445
02:28:10,949 --> 02:28:13,050
Well, I fully intend to.

2446
02:28:13,051 --> 02:28:17,254
Would you say that Dr. Oppenheimer was unalterably opposed to the H-bomb?

2447
02:28:17,255 --> 02:28:20,124
No, he thought that a fusion program

2448
02:28:20,125 --> 02:28:23,193
would come at the expense of our awfully good fission program.

2449
02:28:23,194 --> 02:28:24,795
But that proved not to be the case.

2450
02:28:24,796 --> 02:28:26,997
In the event, both could be done.

2451
02:28:26,998 --> 02:28:29,800
Suppose that this board did not feel satisfied that,

2452
02:28:29,801 --> 02:28:33,804
in his testimony here, Dr. Oppenheimer had been wholly truthful.

2453
02:28:33,805 --> 02:28:36,206
What would you say whether or not he should be cleared?

2454
02:28:36,207 --> 02:28:38,509
Why go through all this against a man

2455
02:28:38,510 --> 02:28:40,811
who has accomplished what Dr. Oppenheimer has?

2456
02:28:40,812 --> 02:28:42,313
Look at his record.

2457
02:28:42,314 --> 02:28:44,581
We have an A-bomb and a whole series of it.

2458
02:28:44,582 --> 02:28:46,517
We have a whole series of Super bombs.

2459
02:28:46,518 --> 02:28:49,386
What more do you want? Mermaids?

2460
02:28:49,387 --> 02:28:53,123
But I've known Secretary Strauss for many years,

2461
02:28:53,124 --> 02:28:56,760
and I feel it a necessity to express the warm support

2462
02:28:56,761 --> 02:28:59,163
for science and scientists Lewis has shown.

2463
02:28:59,164 --> 02:29:02,132
We'll break now, unless there's any immediate business.

2464
02:29:02,133 --> 02:29:05,035
Senator, I'd like to once again request

2465
02:29:05,036 --> 02:29:08,072
that we're furnished with a list of witnesses.

2466
02:29:08,073 --> 02:29:09,707
And I will remind the nominee

2467
02:29:09,708 --> 02:29:12,476
that we don't always have that information in advance.

2468
02:29:12,477 --> 02:29:15,612
We do know that Dr. Hill will be here after lunch.

2469
02:29:15,613 --> 02:29:18,482
Mr. Chairman, our next scheduled witness, Dr. Lawrence,

2470
02:29:18,483 --> 02:29:21,586
has apparently come down with colitis.

2471
02:29:24,623 --> 02:29:26,691
So we'll proceed with William Borden instead.

2472
02:29:27,892 --> 02:29:30,562
Mr. Borden, welcome. Please take a seat.

2473
02:29:31,963 --> 02:29:36,767
Mr. Borden, during your investigation into Dr. Oppenheimer,

2474
02:29:36,768 --> 02:29:39,803
- did you reach certain conclusions? - I did.

2475
02:29:39,804 --> 02:29:42,339
And did there come a time when you expressed those conclusions

2476
02:29:42,340 --> 02:29:45,943
in a letter to Mr. J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation?

2477
02:29:45,944 --> 02:29:48,245
- That is correct. - Prior to the writing of the letter,

2478
02:29:48,246 --> 02:29:50,748
did you discuss the writing of the letter with anybody attached

2479
02:29:50,749 --> 02:29:52,549
to the Atomic Energy Commission?

2480
02:29:52,550 --> 02:29:54,952
- I did not. - Do you have a copy of the letter?

2481
02:29:54,953 --> 02:29:56,153
I have one in front of me.

2482
02:29:56,154 --> 02:29:58,822
Would you please be so kind as to read it, sir?

2483
02:29:58,823 --> 02:30:01,759
"Dear Mr. Hoover, the purpose of this letter is to state..."

2484
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:04,461
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, if I could have a...

2485
02:30:04,462 --> 02:30:07,931
What is the purpose of the delay? He's simply gonna read the letter.

2486
02:30:07,932 --> 02:30:11,402
Mr. Chairman, this is the first I've seen of this letter,

2487
02:30:11,403 --> 02:30:14,004
and I see statements here, at least one,

2488
02:30:14,005 --> 02:30:16,907
of a kind that I don't think anyone would like to see go into the record.

2489
02:30:16,908 --> 02:30:19,643
These are accusations that have not previously been made.

2490
02:30:19,644 --> 02:30:21,612
That are not part of the indictment from Nichols.

2491
02:30:21,613 --> 02:30:23,947
Accusations of a kind that I don't think belong here.

2492
02:30:23,948 --> 02:30:26,083
The witness wrote this letter on his own initiative,

2493
02:30:26,084 --> 02:30:28,585
laying out evidence that has already been before the board.

2494
02:30:28,586 --> 02:30:30,320
His conclusions are valid testimony,

2495
02:30:30,321 --> 02:30:33,857
just like the positive conclusions of friends of Dr. Oppenheimer.

2496
02:30:33,858 --> 02:30:35,225
It cuts both ways.

2497
02:30:35,226 --> 02:30:37,428
How long has counsel been in possession of this letter?

2498
02:30:37,429 --> 02:30:41,331
I don't think I should be subject to cross-examination by you, Mr. Garrison.

2499
02:30:41,332 --> 02:30:44,668
Mr. Garrison, given that we on the board have all read the letter,

2500
02:30:44,669 --> 02:30:47,204
wouldn't it be better to have it in the record?

2501
02:30:47,205 --> 02:30:48,907
Let's proceed.

2502
02:30:50,608 --> 02:30:52,142
"Dear Mr. Hoover,

2503
02:30:52,143 --> 02:30:55,245
the purpose of this letter is to state my opinion

2504
02:30:55,246 --> 02:30:59,650
based upon years of study of the available classified evidence,

2505
02:30:59,651 --> 02:31:01,718
that more probably than not

2506
02:31:01,719 --> 02:31:06,657
J. Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union.

2507
02:31:06,658 --> 02:31:09,059
The following conclusions are justified.

2508
02:31:09,060 --> 02:31:13,397
One, between 1929 and 1942, more probably than not,

2509
02:31:13,398 --> 02:31:17,534
J. Robert Oppenheimer was a sufficiently hardened communist,

2510
02:31:17,535 --> 02:31:20,104
that he volunteered information to the Soviets.

2511
02:31:20,105 --> 02:31:22,239
Two, more probably than not,

2512
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:26,677
he has since been functioning as an espionage agent.

2513
02:31:26,678 --> 02:31:29,146
Three, more probably than not,

2514
02:31:29,147 --> 02:31:31,882
he has since acted under a Soviet directive

2515
02:31:31,883 --> 02:31:34,785
in influencing United States military policy..."

2516
02:31:34,786 --> 02:31:37,054
I'm sorry, Robert. ..."atomic energy, intelligence..."

2517
02:31:37,055 --> 02:31:42,025
Is anyone ever going to tell the truth about what's happening here?

2518
02:31:42,026 --> 02:31:45,163
We will now hear from Dr. David Hill.

2519
02:31:55,173 --> 02:31:58,610
Dr. Hill, would you care to make a statement?

2520
02:32:00,278 --> 02:32:01,678
Thank you.

2521
02:32:01,679 --> 02:32:05,282
I've been asked to testify about Lewis Strauss.

2522
02:32:05,283 --> 02:32:10,321
A man who has given years of service in high positions of government

2523
02:32:10,789 --> 02:32:15,793
and who is known to be earnest, hardworking and intelligent.

2524
02:32:16,728 --> 02:32:19,163
The views I have to express are my own,

2525
02:32:19,164 --> 02:32:22,032
but I believe that much I have to say will help to indicate

2526
02:32:22,033 --> 02:32:25,469
why most of the scientists in this country

2527
02:32:25,470 --> 02:32:30,508
would prefer to see Mr. Strauss completely out of government.

2528
02:32:32,443 --> 02:32:36,446
You're referring to the hostility of certain scientists

2529
02:32:36,447 --> 02:32:40,484
directed toward Mr. Strauss because of his commitment to security,

2530
02:32:40,485 --> 02:32:43,521
as demonstrated in the Oppenheimer affair?

2531
02:32:45,857 --> 02:32:47,591
No.

2532
02:32:47,592 --> 02:32:52,163
Because of the personal vindictiveness he demonstrated against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2533
02:32:53,698 --> 02:32:55,866
Order.

2534
02:32:55,867 --> 02:32:57,601
Order.

2535
02:32:57,602 --> 02:33:01,172
It appears to most scientists around this country

2536
02:33:02,207 --> 02:33:05,108
that Robert Oppenheimer is now being pilloried

2537
02:33:05,109 --> 02:33:09,513
and put through an ordeal because he expressed his honest opinions.

2538
02:33:09,514 --> 02:33:12,849
Dr. Bush, I thought I was performing a service to my country

2539
02:33:12,850 --> 02:33:14,384
when hearing this case.

2540
02:33:14,385 --> 02:33:18,789
No board in this country should sit in judgment of a man

2541
02:33:18,790 --> 02:33:20,924
because he expressed strong opinions.

2542
02:33:20,925 --> 02:33:24,061
If you wanna try that case, you should try me.

2543
02:33:24,062 --> 02:33:27,664
Excuse me, gentlemen, if I become stirred.

2544
02:33:27,665 --> 02:33:29,600
But I am.

2545
02:33:29,601 --> 02:33:33,770
Dr. Hill, we've already heard that Mr. Strauss did not bring the charges,

2546
02:33:33,771 --> 02:33:36,807
or participate in the hearings against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2547
02:33:36,808 --> 02:33:41,612
The Oppenheimer matter was initiated and carried through

2548
02:33:41,613 --> 02:33:44,249
largely through the animus of Lewis Strauss.

2549
02:33:45,783 --> 02:33:48,585
Oppenheimer made mincemeat out of Strauss's position

2550
02:33:48,586 --> 02:33:50,487
on the shipment of isotopes to Norway,

2551
02:33:50,488 --> 02:33:53,957
and Strauss never forgave him this public humiliation.

2552
02:33:53,958 --> 02:33:58,095
Another controversy between them centered around their differences in judgment

2553
02:33:58,096 --> 02:34:01,231
on how the H-bomb would contribute to national security.

2554
02:34:01,232 --> 02:34:03,867
Strauss turned to the personnel security system

2555
02:34:03,868 --> 02:34:07,404
in order to destroy Oppenheimer's effectiveness.

2556
02:34:07,405 --> 02:34:10,374
And Strauss was able to find a few ambitious men

2557
02:34:10,375 --> 02:34:13,243
who also disagreed with Oppenheimer's positions

2558
02:34:13,244 --> 02:34:16,613
and envied him his prestige in government circles.

2559
02:34:16,614 --> 02:34:21,152
I've always assumed, and still assume, that he's loyal to the United States.

2560
02:34:21,552 --> 02:34:23,387
I believe this.

2561
02:34:23,388 --> 02:34:25,856
And I shall believe it until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.

2562
02:34:25,857 --> 02:34:30,094
Do you, or do you not, believe that Dr. Oppenheimer is a security risk?

2563
02:34:33,765 --> 02:34:35,299
In a great number of cases,

2564
02:34:35,300 --> 02:34:38,568
I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act in a way which was, to me,

2565
02:34:38,569 --> 02:34:40,370
exceedingly hard to understand.

2566
02:34:40,371 --> 02:34:43,106
I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues,

2567
02:34:43,107 --> 02:34:46,710
and his actions, frankly, appeared to me confused and complicated.

2568
02:34:46,711 --> 02:34:48,345
To this extent, I feel,

2569
02:34:48,346 --> 02:34:51,581
I want to see the vital interests of this country

2570
02:34:51,582 --> 02:34:53,717
in hands which I understand better,

2571
02:34:53,718 --> 02:34:55,853
and therefore trust more.

2572
02:34:56,621 --> 02:34:58,322
- Thank you, Doctor. - Thank you.

2573
02:35:02,093 --> 02:35:03,194
I'm sorry.

2574
02:35:05,263 --> 02:35:08,232
You shook his fucking hand?

2575
02:35:08,967 --> 02:35:10,934
Oh, I would have spit in his face.

2576
02:35:10,935 --> 02:35:12,936
Not sure the board would have appreciated that.

2577
02:35:12,937 --> 02:35:14,905
Is it not gentlemanly enough for you?

2578
02:35:14,906 --> 02:35:17,641
I think you're all being too goddamn gentlemanly.

2579
02:35:17,642 --> 02:35:19,643
Gray must see what Robb is doing.

2580
02:35:19,644 --> 02:35:21,578
Why doesn't he just shut him down?

2581
02:35:21,579 --> 02:35:24,114
And you shaking Teller's hand.

2582
02:35:24,115 --> 02:35:27,784
You need to stop playing the martyr.

2583
02:35:27,785 --> 02:35:32,823
Under the current AEC guidelines, would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

2584
02:35:38,997 --> 02:35:43,467
Under my interpretation of the Atomic Energy Act,

2585
02:35:43,468 --> 02:35:48,406
which did not exist when I hired Dr. Oppenheimer in 1942,

2586
02:35:49,407 --> 02:35:54,412
I would not clear him today if I were on the commission.

2587
02:35:55,079 --> 02:35:56,613
Good, thank you, General, that is all.

2588
02:35:56,614 --> 02:35:59,416
But I don't think I'd clear any of those guys.

2589
02:35:59,417 --> 02:36:00,685
That's all.

2590
02:36:03,321 --> 02:36:05,455
Dr. Oppenheimer had no responsibility

2591
02:36:05,456 --> 02:36:08,325
in the selection or the clearance of Klaus Fuchs, did he?

2592
02:36:08,326 --> 02:36:09,493
No. None at all.

2593
02:36:09,494 --> 02:36:11,328
And you wouldn't want to leave this board

2594
02:36:11,329 --> 02:36:12,996
with any suggestion today

2595
02:36:12,997 --> 02:36:15,966
that you're here questioning his basic loyalty to the United States

2596
02:36:15,967 --> 02:36:17,634
and the operation of Los Alamos.

2597
02:36:17,635 --> 02:36:19,436
By no means.

2598
02:36:19,437 --> 02:36:22,273
I hope I didn't lead anyone to believe otherwise for an instant.

2599
02:36:23,374 --> 02:36:24,776
Thank you, General.

2600
02:36:41,959 --> 02:36:44,294
Okay. We shouldn't keep them waiting.

2601
02:36:44,295 --> 02:36:45,695
She'll be here.

2602
02:36:45,696 --> 02:36:47,664
Do you even want her here?

2603
02:36:47,665 --> 02:36:49,399
Only a fool or an adolescent

2604
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:51,701
presumes to know someone else's relationship,

2605
02:36:51,702 --> 02:36:53,704
and you're neither, Lloyd.

2606
02:36:56,240 --> 02:36:59,243
Kitty and I, we're grown-ups.

2607
02:37:00,111 --> 02:37:02,412
We've walked through fire together.

2608
02:37:02,413 --> 02:37:04,748
She'll do fine.

2609
02:37:04,749 --> 02:37:09,152
Would you describe your views on communism as pro, anti, neutral?

2610
02:37:09,153 --> 02:37:10,821
Very strongly against.

2611
02:37:10,822 --> 02:37:15,193
I've had nothing to do with communism since 1936, since...

2612
02:37:16,060 --> 02:37:18,162
since before I met Robert.

2613
02:37:19,664 --> 02:37:21,898
That's all.

2614
02:37:21,899 --> 02:37:23,733
The record demonstrates that Oppenheimer

2615
02:37:23,734 --> 02:37:27,003
was not interrogated by impartial and disinterested counsel

2616
02:37:27,004 --> 02:37:28,338
for the Gray board.

2617
02:37:28,339 --> 02:37:30,474
He was interrogated by a prosecutor

2618
02:37:30,475 --> 02:37:32,642
who used all the tricks of a rather ingenious legal background.

2619
02:37:32,643 --> 02:37:37,381
You are charging now that the Gray board permitted a prosecution.

2620
02:37:37,982 --> 02:37:39,850
If I were on the Gray board,

2621
02:37:39,851 --> 02:37:43,587
I would have protested against the tactics of the man who served, in fact,

2622
02:37:43,588 --> 02:37:45,021
as the prosecuting counsel.

2623
02:37:45,022 --> 02:37:47,158
A man appointed, not by the board,

2624
02:37:48,159 --> 02:37:50,461
but by Lewis Strauss.

2625
02:37:52,396 --> 02:37:53,397
Who was this?

2626
02:37:54,866 --> 02:37:56,633
I'm sorry?

2627
02:37:56,634 --> 02:37:57,834
Who was this?

2628
02:37:57,835 --> 02:37:59,303
Uh, Roger Robb.

2629
02:37:59,804 --> 02:38:01,305
Mrs. Oppenheimer.

2630
02:38:05,476 --> 02:38:08,045
Did you have a Communist Party membership card?

2631
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:10,847
I'm...

2632
02:38:10,848 --> 02:38:11,915
I'm not sure.

2633
02:38:11,916 --> 02:38:13,351
Not sure?

2634
02:38:15,887 --> 02:38:17,221
Well...

2635
02:38:20,224 --> 02:38:21,259
Well?

2636
02:38:30,234 --> 02:38:33,270
I mean, presumably, the act of joining the Party

2637
02:38:33,271 --> 02:38:36,908
required sending some money and receiving a card, no?

2638
02:38:39,644 --> 02:38:40,878
Yeah.

2639
02:38:46,684 --> 02:38:48,052
Sorry.

2640
02:38:48,853 --> 02:38:50,354
Yeah.

2641
02:38:51,989 --> 02:38:55,458
It's just it was all so very long ago, Mr. Robb, wasn't it?

2642
02:38:55,459 --> 02:38:57,227
- Not really. - Long enough to have forgotten.

2643
02:38:57,228 --> 02:38:58,595
Did you return the card or rip it up?

2644
02:38:58,596 --> 02:39:00,664
The card whose existence I've forgotten?

2645
02:39:00,665 --> 02:39:03,834
- Your Communist Party membership card. - Haven't the slightest idea.

2646
02:39:06,070 --> 02:39:10,640
Can a distinction be made between Soviet communism and communism?

2647
02:39:10,641 --> 02:39:13,810
In the days when I was a member, I thought they were definitely two things.

2648
02:39:13,811 --> 02:39:17,113
I thought that the Communist Party of the United States

2649
02:39:17,114 --> 02:39:19,749
was concerned with our domestic problems.

2650
02:39:19,750 --> 02:39:21,618
I now no longer believe this.

2651
02:39:21,619 --> 02:39:23,520
I believe the thing's linked together and spread all over the world,

2652
02:39:23,521 --> 02:39:27,257
and I have believed this since I left the Party, 16 years ago.

2653
02:39:27,258 --> 02:39:30,594
- But... - 17 years ago. My mistake.

2654
02:39:30,595 --> 02:39:32,129
- But you sai... - Sorry, 18.

2655
02:39:33,431 --> 02:39:35,632
18 years ago.

2656
02:39:35,633 --> 02:39:38,868
Are you familiar with the fact your husband was making contributions

2657
02:39:38,869 --> 02:39:41,004
to the Spanish Civil War as late as 1942?

2658
02:39:41,005 --> 02:39:43,306
I knew that Robert gave money from time to time.

2659
02:39:43,307 --> 02:39:45,942
Did you know this money was going into Communist Party channels?

2660
02:39:45,943 --> 02:39:47,844
- Don't you mean "through"? - Pardon?

2661
02:39:47,845 --> 02:39:50,714
I think you mean "through Communist Party channels," don't you?

2662
02:39:50,715 --> 02:39:52,449
Yes! Yes?

2663
02:39:52,450 --> 02:39:54,351
- Yes! - Yes.

2664
02:39:54,352 --> 02:39:57,220
Then would it be fair to say that this meant that by 1942,

2665
02:39:57,221 --> 02:40:01,391
your husband had not stopped having anything to do with the Communist Party?

2666
02:40:01,392 --> 02:40:03,059
You don't have to answer that yes or no.

2667
02:40:03,060 --> 02:40:04,661
You can answer that any way you wish.

2668
02:40:04,662 --> 02:40:06,296
I know that, thank you.

2669
02:40:06,297 --> 02:40:08,164
It's your question.

2670
02:40:08,165 --> 02:40:09,666
It's not properly phrased.

2671
02:40:09,667 --> 02:40:11,401
- Do you understand what I'm getting at? - I do.

2672
02:40:11,402 --> 02:40:12,969
Then why don't you answer it that way?

2673
02:40:12,970 --> 02:40:14,404
'Cause I don't like your phrase.

2674
02:40:14,405 --> 02:40:16,473
"Having anything to do with the Communist Party."

2675
02:40:16,474 --> 02:40:19,542
Because Robert never had anything to do with the Communist Party as such.

2676
02:40:19,543 --> 02:40:21,878
I know he gave money to Spanish refugees.

2677
02:40:21,879 --> 02:40:25,281
I know he took an intellectual interest in communist ideas...

2678
02:40:25,282 --> 02:40:26,950
Are there two types of communists?

2679
02:40:26,951 --> 02:40:29,987
Intellectual communists and your plain, old, regular commie?

2680
02:40:31,222 --> 02:40:32,922
Well, I couldn't answer that one.

2681
02:40:32,923 --> 02:40:35,626
I couldn't either.

2682
02:40:42,533 --> 02:40:43,566
Good evening.

2683
02:40:43,567 --> 02:40:45,301
Robert, you can't win this thing.

2684
02:40:45,302 --> 02:40:47,404
It's a kangaroo court with a predetermined outcome.

2685
02:40:47,405 --> 02:40:51,609
Why put yourself through more of it? I have my reasons.

2686
02:40:52,977 --> 02:40:54,144
All right.

2687
02:40:54,145 --> 02:40:55,579
Good night.

2688
02:41:00,117 --> 02:41:01,585
He has a point.

2689
02:41:02,586 --> 02:41:04,688
I'm not sure you understand, Albert.

2690
02:41:04,689 --> 02:41:05,855
No?

2691
02:41:05,856 --> 02:41:09,160
I left my country never to return.

2692
02:41:09,894 --> 02:41:11,795
You served your country well.

2693
02:41:11,796 --> 02:41:15,665
If this is the reward she offers you, then...

2694
02:41:15,666 --> 02:41:18,402
perhaps you should turn your back on her.

2695
02:41:19,203 --> 02:41:22,072
Damn it, I happen to love this country.

2696
02:41:22,073 --> 02:41:24,340
Then tell them to go to hell.

2697
02:41:24,341 --> 02:41:25,975
Interestingly enough,

2698
02:41:25,976 --> 02:41:28,378
this is no longer a confirmation hearing,

2699
02:41:28,379 --> 02:41:31,482
it's now a trial about a trial!

2700
02:41:32,883 --> 02:41:36,052
It's not good he's telling everyone you initiated the hearings.

2701
02:41:36,053 --> 02:41:37,954
He can't prove a goddamn thing.

2702
02:41:37,955 --> 02:41:41,624
He certainly can't prove that I gave the file to Borden.

2703
02:41:41,625 --> 02:41:44,928
We're not in court, sir. There's no burden of proof.

2704
02:41:44,929 --> 02:41:46,764
Right. They're not convicting...

2705
02:41:47,665 --> 02:41:49,199
just denying.

2706
02:41:49,200 --> 02:41:52,368
But why would Hill come here to tear me down? What's his angle?

2707
02:41:52,369 --> 02:41:55,472
Do people need a reason to do the right thing?

2708
02:41:55,473 --> 02:41:56,873
As he sees it.

2709
02:41:56,874 --> 02:41:59,776
I told you, Oppenheimer poisoned the scientists against me,

2710
02:41:59,777 --> 02:42:01,311
right from that first meeting.

2711
02:42:01,312 --> 02:42:04,214
I don't know what Oppenheimer said to him that day,

2712
02:42:04,215 --> 02:42:07,184
but Einstein wouldn't even meet my eye.

2713
02:42:08,753 --> 02:42:11,454
Oppenheimer knows how to manipulate his own.

2714
02:42:11,455 --> 02:42:14,991
And at Los Alamos, he preyed on the naivete of scientists

2715
02:42:14,992 --> 02:42:17,527
who thought they'd get a say in how we used their work.

2716
02:42:17,528 --> 02:42:20,230
Don't ever think he was that naive himself.

2717
02:42:20,231 --> 02:42:22,165
Doctor.

2718
02:42:22,166 --> 02:42:27,171
During your work on the hydrogen bomb, were you deterred by any moral qualms?

2719
02:42:27,805 --> 02:42:29,305
Yes, of course.

2720
02:42:29,306 --> 02:42:31,341
But you still got on with your work, didn't you?

2721
02:42:31,342 --> 02:42:35,145
Yes, because this was work of exploration. It was not the preparation of a weapon.

2722
02:42:35,146 --> 02:42:37,080
You mean it was more of an academic excursion?

2723
02:42:37,081 --> 02:42:40,283
No, it is not an academic thing whether you can build a hydrogen bomb.

2724
02:42:40,284 --> 02:42:41,584
It's a matter of life and death.

2725
02:42:41,585 --> 02:42:43,419
By 1942, you were actively pushing

2726
02:42:43,420 --> 02:42:45,288
the development of the hydrogen bomb, weren't you?

2727
02:42:45,289 --> 02:42:48,491
Pushing's not the right word. Supporting it and working on it, yes.

2728
02:42:48,492 --> 02:42:50,860
So when did these moral qualms become so strong

2729
02:42:50,861 --> 02:42:53,930
that you actively opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb?

2730
02:42:53,931 --> 02:42:56,800
When it was suggested that it be the policy of the United States

2731
02:42:56,801 --> 02:42:59,736
to make these things at all cost, without regard to the balance

2732
02:42:59,737 --> 02:43:03,607
between these weapons and atomic weapons as part of our arsenal.

2733
02:43:04,742 --> 02:43:06,843
What do moral qualms have to do with that?

2734
02:43:06,844 --> 02:43:10,480
What do moral qualms have to do with it? Yes.

2735
02:43:10,481 --> 02:43:12,615
Oppenheimer wanted to own the atomic bomb.

2736
02:43:12,616 --> 02:43:14,651
He wanted to be the man who moved the Earth.

2737
02:43:14,652 --> 02:43:19,088
He talks about putting the nuclear genie back in the bottle.

2738
02:43:19,089 --> 02:43:22,759
Well, I'm here to tell you that I know J. Robert Oppenheimer,

2739
02:43:22,760 --> 02:43:25,995
and if he could do it all over, he'd do it all the same.

2740
02:43:25,996 --> 02:43:30,033
You know he's never once said that he regrets Hiroshima?

2741
02:43:30,034 --> 02:43:32,702
He'd do it all over. Why?

2742
02:43:32,703 --> 02:43:36,606
Because it made him the most important man who ever lived.

2743
02:43:36,607 --> 02:43:40,476
Well, we've freely used the atomic bomb...

2744
02:43:40,477 --> 02:43:42,579
In fact, Doctor, you assisted in selecting the target

2745
02:43:42,580 --> 02:43:44,781
to drop the atomic bomb on Japan, didn't you?

2746
02:43:44,782 --> 02:43:46,716
- Yes. - Then you knew, did you not,

2747
02:43:46,717 --> 02:43:49,018
that by dropping that atomic bomb on the target you selected,

2748
02:43:49,019 --> 02:43:52,021
that thousands of civilians would be killed or injured, is that correct?

2749
02:43:52,022 --> 02:43:54,424
Yes, not as many as turned out...

2750
02:43:54,425 --> 02:43:57,093
Oh. Well, how many were killed or injured?

2751
02:43:57,094 --> 02:43:58,228
70,000.

2752
02:43:58,229 --> 02:43:59,796
70,000 at both Hiroshima and...

2753
02:43:59,797 --> 02:44:01,464
110,000 at both.

2754
02:44:01,465 --> 02:44:03,400
On the day of each bombing?

2755
02:44:04,602 --> 02:44:06,836
- Yes. - And in the weeks and years that followed?

2756
02:44:06,837 --> 02:44:10,306
It has been put at somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000.

2757
02:44:10,307 --> 02:44:12,442
- 220,000 dead, at least. - Yes.

2758
02:44:12,443 --> 02:44:14,345
Any moral scruples about that?

2759
02:44:15,913 --> 02:44:17,814
Terrible ones.

2760
02:44:17,815 --> 02:44:20,783
Yet you testified in here that the bombing of Hiroshima was very successful.

2761
02:44:20,784 --> 02:44:23,887
- Technically successful. - Oh! Technically, it was very successful.

2762
02:44:23,888 --> 02:44:26,256
And it is also alleged to have helped end the war.

2763
02:44:26,257 --> 02:44:29,592
Would you have been supportive of the dropping of a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima?

2764
02:44:29,593 --> 02:44:32,161
- That would make no sense at all. - Why?

2765
02:44:32,162 --> 02:44:33,897
The target is too small.

2766
02:44:33,898 --> 02:44:36,566
Well, supposing there had been a target in Japan big enough

2767
02:44:36,567 --> 02:44:38,001
for a thermonuclear weapon,

2768
02:44:38,002 --> 02:44:39,669
would you have been opposed to the dropping of it?

2769
02:44:39,670 --> 02:44:41,471
This was not a problem with which I was confronted...

2770
02:44:41,472 --> 02:44:43,106
I'm confronting you with it now, sir.

2771
02:44:43,107 --> 02:44:44,807
It was all part of his plan.

2772
02:44:44,808 --> 02:44:48,645
He wanted the glorious, insincere guilt of the self-important

2773
02:44:48,646 --> 02:44:50,513
to wear like a fucking crown.

2774
02:44:50,514 --> 02:44:55,552
Say, "No, we cannot go down this road," even as he knew we'd have to.

2775
02:44:56,186 --> 02:44:58,221
Would you have been opposed to the dropping...

2776
02:44:58,222 --> 02:45:00,490
...of a thermonuclear weapon on Japan because of moral scruples?

2777
02:45:00,491 --> 02:45:02,058
Yes, I believe I would, sir.

2778
02:45:02,059 --> 02:45:03,593
Did you oppose the dropping

2779
02:45:03,594 --> 02:45:05,762
of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima because of moral scruples?

2780
02:45:05,763 --> 02:45:07,764
- We set forth our arg... - No, you.

2781
02:45:07,765 --> 02:45:09,599
- I'm asking you. You! - I set...

2782
02:45:09,600 --> 02:45:11,901
I set forth our arguments against dropping it,

2783
02:45:11,902 --> 02:45:13,937
but I did not endorse them.

2784
02:45:13,938 --> 02:45:16,906
You mean after working night and day for three years building the bomb,

2785
02:45:16,907 --> 02:45:18,942
you then argued against the use of it.

2786
02:45:18,943 --> 02:45:22,779
I was asked by the secretary of war what the views of scientists were.

2787
02:45:22,780 --> 02:45:25,014
I gave him the views against and the views for.

2788
02:45:25,015 --> 02:45:27,617
You supported the dropping of the atom bomb on Japan.

2789
02:45:27,618 --> 02:45:30,086
- What do you mean, "support"? - You supported it.

2790
02:45:30,087 --> 02:45:32,722
- You helped pick the target, didn't you? - I did my job.

2791
02:45:32,723 --> 02:45:35,291
I was not in a policy-making position at Los Alamos.

2792
02:45:35,292 --> 02:45:37,126
I would have done anything I was asked to do.

2793
02:45:37,127 --> 02:45:39,729
Then you would have built the H-bomb too, wouldn't you?

2794
02:45:39,730 --> 02:45:42,031
- I couldn't. - I didn't ask you that, Doctor.

2795
02:45:42,032 --> 02:45:43,499
And the GAC report,

2796
02:45:43,500 --> 02:45:45,902
which you co-authored after the Soviet atomic test,

2797
02:45:45,903 --> 02:45:49,539
said a Super bomb should never be built.

2798
02:45:49,540 --> 02:45:50,907
What we meant... What I meant was...

2799
02:45:50,908 --> 02:45:53,043
- What you? Who? Who? - What I meant...

2800
02:45:54,545 --> 02:45:57,680
And wouldn't the Russians do anything to increase their strength?

2801
02:45:57,681 --> 02:46:00,183
If we did it, they would have to do it.

2802
02:46:00,184 --> 02:46:04,654
Our efforts would only fuel their efforts, just as it had with the atomic bomb.

2803
02:46:04,655 --> 02:46:08,424
"Just as it had with the atomic bomb," exactly!

2804
02:46:08,425 --> 02:46:12,896
No moral scruples in 1945, plenty in 1949.

2805
02:46:17,101 --> 02:46:18,836
Dr. Oppenheimer...

2806
02:46:20,404 --> 02:46:23,239
when did your strong moral convictions develop

2807
02:46:23,240 --> 02:46:25,442
with respect to the hydrogen bomb?

2808
02:46:32,783 --> 02:46:34,885
When it became clear to me...

2809
02:46:36,020 --> 02:46:39,490
that we would tend to use any weapon we had.

2810
02:46:42,092 --> 02:46:44,494
J. Robert Oppenheimer the Martyr.

2811
02:46:44,495 --> 02:46:46,996
I gave him exactly what he wanted.

2812
02:46:46,997 --> 02:46:51,568
To be remembered for Trinity, not Hiroshima.

2813
02:46:52,136 --> 02:46:54,471
Not Nagasaki.

2814
02:46:57,207 --> 02:46:59,042
He should be thanking me.

2815
02:47:00,044 --> 02:47:01,512
Well, he's not.

2816
02:47:04,615 --> 02:47:05,982
Do we still have enough votes,

2817
02:47:05,983 --> 02:47:07,984
or is the crowning moment of my career

2818
02:47:07,985 --> 02:47:11,988
about to become the most public humiliation of my life?

2819
02:47:11,989 --> 02:47:15,758
Full Senate's about to vote. You'll scrape through.

2820
02:47:15,759 --> 02:47:17,493
Great, then gather the fucking press.

2821
02:47:17,494 --> 02:47:19,462
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

2822
02:47:19,463 --> 02:47:22,532
This board, having heard testimony from you

2823
02:47:22,533 --> 02:47:25,568
and many of your current and former colleagues,

2824
02:47:25,569 --> 02:47:30,107
has come to the unanimous conclusion that you are a loyal citizen.

2825
02:47:32,076 --> 02:47:37,081
However, in the light of your continuing associations

2826
02:47:37,314 --> 02:47:40,917
and disregard for the security apparatus of this country,

2827
02:47:40,918 --> 02:47:44,554
together with your somewhat disturbing conduct

2828
02:47:44,555 --> 02:47:46,556
on the hydrogen bomb program,

2829
02:47:46,557 --> 02:47:48,357
and the regrettable lack of candor

2830
02:47:48,358 --> 02:47:51,327
in certain of your responses to this board,

2831
02:47:51,328 --> 02:47:54,063
we have voted two-to-one

2832
02:47:54,064 --> 02:47:57,166
to deny the renewal of your security clearance.

2833
02:47:57,167 --> 02:48:00,203
A full written opinion, with a dissent from Mr. Evans,

2834
02:48:00,204 --> 02:48:03,806
will be issued to the AEC in the coming days.

2835
02:48:03,807 --> 02:48:05,042
That is all.

2836
02:48:09,346 --> 02:48:10,981
Gordon.

2837
02:48:15,586 --> 02:48:17,421
Robert.

2838
02:48:18,055 --> 02:48:19,123
Robert.

2839
02:48:22,192 --> 02:48:23,660
Don't, uh...

2840
02:48:26,296 --> 02:48:27,931
Don't take in the sheets.

2841
02:48:32,436 --> 02:48:35,304
- Sir. - Two minutes. Two minutes.

2842
02:48:35,305 --> 02:48:37,207
You'll get your shot.

2843
02:48:40,778 --> 02:48:42,145
Is it official?

2844
02:48:44,148 --> 02:48:48,151
Well, there were a couple of unexpected holdouts.

2845
02:48:53,323 --> 02:48:55,958
I'm denied. Yeah?

2846
02:48:55,959 --> 02:48:57,961
I'm afraid so, sir. All right.

2847
02:49:05,469 --> 02:49:06,636
Who were the holdouts?

2848
02:49:06,637 --> 02:49:09,539
Um... There were three,

2849
02:49:09,540 --> 02:49:11,941
led by the junior senator from Massachusetts.

2850
02:49:11,942 --> 02:49:14,110
Young guy trying to make a name for himself,

2851
02:49:14,111 --> 02:49:16,579
didn't like what you did to Oppenheimer.

2852
02:49:16,580 --> 02:49:17,848
What's his name?

2853
02:49:18,549 --> 02:49:21,852
Uh, Kennedy. John F. Kennedy.

2854
02:49:25,489 --> 02:49:26,857
Kitty?

2855
02:49:32,830 --> 02:49:36,365
Did you think that if you let them tar and feather you,

2856
02:49:36,366 --> 02:49:38,735
that the world would forgive you?

2857
02:49:42,406 --> 02:49:44,041
It won't.

2858
02:49:46,276 --> 02:49:47,678
We'll see.

2859
02:49:57,487 --> 02:49:59,089
Goddamn it.

2860
02:50:01,825 --> 02:50:03,826
You told me I'd be okay.

2861
02:50:03,827 --> 02:50:06,329
Yeah, well, I didn't have all the facts, did I?

2862
02:50:06,330 --> 02:50:07,730
Here's a fact.

2863
02:50:07,731 --> 02:50:09,632
President Eisenhower pinned the Medal of Freedom

2864
02:50:09,633 --> 02:50:11,367
on my chest last year,

2865
02:50:11,368 --> 02:50:13,669
'cause I've always done what's right for this country.

2866
02:50:13,670 --> 02:50:15,972
They don't want me in the Cabinet room?

2867
02:50:15,973 --> 02:50:18,407
Oh, that's... That's fine.

2868
02:50:18,408 --> 02:50:21,110
Maybe they should just invite Oppenheimer instead.

2869
02:50:21,111 --> 02:50:22,912
Maybe they will.

2870
02:50:22,913 --> 02:50:26,916
I told you, he turned the scientists against me one by one,

2871
02:50:26,917 --> 02:50:28,317
starting with Einstein.

2872
02:50:28,318 --> 02:50:30,686
I told you about Einstein. I saw him by the pond.

2873
02:50:30,687 --> 02:50:32,421
You did, but you know, sir,

2874
02:50:32,422 --> 02:50:35,992
since nobody really knows what they said to each other that day,

2875
02:50:35,993 --> 02:50:39,695
is it possible they didn't talk about you at all?

2876
02:50:39,696 --> 02:50:42,165
Is it possible they spoke about something

2877
02:50:43,267 --> 02:50:44,634
more important?

2878
02:50:44,635 --> 02:50:46,603
Mr. Strauss!

2879
02:50:55,479 --> 02:50:57,280
Oh!

2880
02:50:59,549 --> 02:51:00,916
Thank you.

2881
02:51:00,917 --> 02:51:02,285
Albert.

2882
02:51:03,453 --> 02:51:05,454
Ah...

2883
02:51:05,455 --> 02:51:07,157
The man of the moment.

2884
02:51:10,994 --> 02:51:14,230
You once held a reception for me.

2885
02:51:14,231 --> 02:51:17,633
In Berkeley. You gave me an award, Mmm? Yes.

2886
02:51:17,634 --> 02:51:22,271
You all thought that I had lost the ability to understand

2887
02:51:22,272 --> 02:51:24,006
what I'd started.

2888
02:51:24,007 --> 02:51:27,710
So, the award really wasn't for me.

2889
02:51:27,711 --> 02:51:30,247
It was for all of you, hmm?

2890
02:51:31,815 --> 02:51:34,083
Now it's your turn

2891
02:51:34,084 --> 02:51:38,755
to deal with the consequences of your achievement.

2892
02:51:39,656 --> 02:51:41,123
And one day,

2893
02:51:41,124 --> 02:51:43,593
when they've punished you enough...

2894
02:51:45,128 --> 02:51:48,999
they'll serve you salmon and potato salad.

2895
02:51:53,337 --> 02:51:54,504
Make speeches...

2896
02:51:56,306 --> 02:51:57,941
...give you a medal.

2897
02:51:59,710 --> 02:52:01,077
Hello, Frank.

2898
02:52:01,078 --> 02:52:02,813
You're happy, I'm happy.

2899
02:52:09,586 --> 02:52:12,756
Pat you on the back, tell you all is forgiven.

2900
02:52:14,424 --> 02:52:15,659
Just remember...

2901
02:52:17,160 --> 02:52:19,229
it won't be for you.

2902
02:52:24,368 --> 02:52:25,869
It'll be for them.

2903
02:52:39,249 --> 02:52:40,717
Albert.

2904
02:52:42,085 --> 02:52:45,421
When I came to you with those calculations,

2905
02:52:45,422 --> 02:52:47,723
we thought we might start a chain reaction

2906
02:52:47,724 --> 02:52:51,394
that would destroy the entire world?

2907
02:52:52,162 --> 02:52:55,966
Mmm. I remember it well. What of it?

2908
02:52:59,703 --> 02:53:01,371
I believe we did.
