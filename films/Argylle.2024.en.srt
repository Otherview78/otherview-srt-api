1
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:37,242
I certainly hope you dance
as well as you dress.

2
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:39,912
There's only one way to find out.

3
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:02,476
Do you do the whirlybird?

4
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,478
Must you even ask?

5
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:27,334
Don't you know who I am?

6
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:28,585
No.

7
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:30,546
But I'd like to find out.

8
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:34,216
How I wish you were here
to capture my heart,

9
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:38,345
not simply to capture me, Agent Argylle.

10
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:54,820
I guess the whirlybird
doesn't catch the worm.

11
00:03:04,037 --> 00:03:05,539
Any last words?

12
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,507
A little help, Keira?

13
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:17,092
Who's Keira?

14
00:03:17,926 --> 00:03:22,222
The girl who gave up being the next
Steve Jobs to save his sorry ass.

15
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:24,141
<i>You're welcome.</i>

16
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:41,033
Need a lift?

17
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:43,285
Legrange made me.
She knew exactly who I was.

18
00:03:43,368 --> 00:03:45,537
Well, then let's get the hell outta here.

19
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Keira!

20
00:04:18,278 --> 00:04:19,988
She's hit. Keira's down.

21
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:21,073
<i>Sending medevac.</i>

22
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:23,659
You need to stay on target, Argylle.

23
00:04:23,742 --> 00:04:25,244
<i>No, I can save her.</i>

24
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:27,704
Let medevac do their job. You do yours.

25
00:04:28,288 --> 00:04:29,873
<i>That's an order.</i>

26
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:46,408
Wyatt, I lost her.

27
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:48,744
<i>What's your status?</i>

28
00:05:50,412 --> 00:05:52,706
I'm about to enjoy
a delicious Greek coffee.

29
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:54,666
Well, I suggest you hurry up.

30
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,543
<i>She's inbound to your position.</i>

31
00:05:57,461 --> 00:05:58,462
Relax.

32
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:20,108
Bad news for you,

33
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:22,611
this is the only exit route
off the island.

34
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:24,696
The good news?

35
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,865
This place makes phenomenal karydopita.

36
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:32,079
I hope you like it.

37
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,374
Because it's about to be your last meal

38
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:37,960
unless you tell us who told you
that we were coming.

39
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:40,838
Who?

40
00:06:41,713 --> 00:06:42,714
You don't answer,

41
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:45,259
you're gonna be the same temperature
as my coffee right now.

42
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:48,387
Which, thanks to you, is ice-cold.

43
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:49,971
Phone.

44
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,693
You and I, we're not so different.

45
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,444
You're a terrorist.

46
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:08,490
Then what, Agent Argylle,
does that make you?

47
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:14,955
Argylle.

48
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:24,339
Be advised, Legrange,

49
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:27,968
Agent Argylle is en route
to your location now.

50
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:36,560
It seems we serve the same master.

51
00:07:54,036 --> 00:07:57,331
<i>Argylle, Wyatt, complete your mission
and return to base.</i>

52
00:07:58,373 --> 00:07:59,374
<i>Argylle.</i>

53
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,584
Cut your feed.

54
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,002
<i>Think clearly.</i>

55
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:04,421
<i>Use your head.</i>

56
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:06,340
<i>You can't believe a goddamn word she sa...</i>

57
00:08:14,097 --> 00:08:15,432
We're on our own now.

58
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:18,936
The Directorate will come after us.

59
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:22,523
- So we go dark. Off the grid.
- "'<i>So we go dark. Off the grid.</i>'

60
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:24,191
- Fully.
- '<i>Fully.</i>'

61
00:08:24,983 --> 00:08:28,612
- We trust each other...
- 'We trust each other and no one else.'

62
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,281
'You understand me?'

63
00:08:33,242 --> 00:08:39,248
'From this moment forward, it's
a whole new ball game, ' warned Argylle.

64
00:08:40,457 --> 00:08:43,293
For he knew there was no turning back.

65
00:08:44,294 --> 00:08:49,174
That nothing would ever
be the same again."

66
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:56,806
Elly Conway, ladies and gentlemen.
All right.

67
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:00,686
{\an8}Thank you. Thank you.

68
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:02,980
Okay, and now let's take some questions.

69
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:04,439
So... Yes?

70
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,817
- Hi, Elly.
- Hi. Hi.

71
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,863
I'm actually an aspiring writer,
but I can never seem to find the time.

72
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:12,781
Do you have any advice?

73
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:15,951
Oh, my goodness,
I know how hard that can be.

74
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:20,581
For me, when I was a waitress,
I was juggling so many shifts.

75
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:25,043
I never had the time to really write
until the... well, the...

76
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:28,922
the skating accident,
which I've obviously spoken about.

77
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:32,593
And I think when something like that
happens to you,

78
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:35,429
it makes you realize
that tomorrow isn't promised.

79
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:37,556
And that if you can't find the time,

80
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:41,810
you have to make the time to do the things
that are important to you.

81
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:46,231
And once I did that, all the characters
and stories and ideas

82
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:49,818
that had been trapped in my head
for so many years

83
00:09:49,902 --> 00:09:52,321
finally got let out onto the page.

84
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:55,199
All right, let's take another question.

85
00:09:55,282 --> 00:09:56,408
Yeah?

86
00:09:57,409 --> 00:09:58,744
- Hello.
- Hello.

87
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:02,331
It's no secret that you are
the spy novelist actual spies read.

88
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:05,709
You have even predicted
real-life geopolitical events.

89
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:10,547
Fleming, Forsyth, le Carré,

90
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:13,842
they all had the same touch
and they turned out to be real spies.

91
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:15,761
So, what?

92
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:17,888
Are you a spy too?

93
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:20,140
How do you do it?

94
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:22,726
Gosh, I wish. I wish.

95
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:26,855
That would make everything so much easier,
but no.

96
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:32,236
As boring as it may seem, the secret is
research, research, research.

97
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:38,784
Although, that is what I would say
if I was a real spy, so...

98
00:10:40,786 --> 00:10:41,954
Okay, next question.

99
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:43,580
Yes? Young lady down in front.

100
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:45,916
When are we gonna get book five?

101
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:47,876
Well.

102
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,711
Sooner than you think.

103
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:51,505
Very exciting.

104
00:10:51,588 --> 00:10:53,215
Yeah? The gentleman in the gray hoodie.

105
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:55,592
Sorry if this sounds a bit forward,

106
00:10:55,676 --> 00:10:58,470
but I don't know
if I'll ever get another chance to ask,

107
00:10:58,554 --> 00:11:00,848
so, do you have any plans tonight?

108
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:02,599
That's...

109
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:05,686
That's very flattering.

110
00:11:06,478 --> 00:11:10,732
But tonight I actually do have a hot date.

111
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:25,497
Yep. Another hot date.

112
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,161
You ready?

113
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:09,708
Mama's got to get to work.

114
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:16,924
The stolen master file

115
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:20,219
held more than enough proof

116
00:12:21,178 --> 00:12:22,804
to bring the Directorate down.

117
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:29,269
<i>Although the hacker's price was high,</i>

118
00:12:29,353 --> 00:12:33,315
<i>Argylle knew that it would be
worth its weight in gold.</i>

119
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:35,734
Half now, half on delivery.

120
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:38,654
As discussed.

121
00:12:41,323 --> 00:12:44,368
This phone is the key to the master file.

122
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:47,538
Go to London.

123
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:51,416
Once you've arrived, you'll receive a call
on that phone from my employer,

124
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,669
the world's greatest hacker.

125
00:12:57,297 --> 00:13:02,010
<i>Finally in reach of the silver bullet</i>

126
00:13:03,345 --> 00:13:05,556
which would destroy the Directorate

127
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:09,309
once and for all.

128
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:14,314
The end.

129
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:23,198
Book five finished.

130
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:24,616
Cheers, Argylle.

131
00:13:43,051 --> 00:13:45,137
Mom, morning. Hi.

132
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,306
Did you see my email
I sent you last night?

133
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:48,682
I read it.

134
00:13:48,765 --> 00:13:51,268
Overnight? The whole thing?

135
00:13:51,351 --> 00:13:53,729
Sweetie, I'm your mother. Of course I did.

136
00:13:53,812 --> 00:13:57,065
I took two Adderall, started,
couldn't put it down.

137
00:13:57,149 --> 00:13:58,692
I was blown away.

138
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:00,319
You did it again, angel.

139
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:01,653
Mom, I'm so relieved.

140
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:05,574
I was going over and over it
in my head and stressing

141
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:08,243
and I'm just glad you like it, honestly.

142
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:10,495
<i>Now we can get it out to the publisher
and just...</i>

143
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:12,206
Right. Well...

144
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:13,874
Oh, no.

145
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:15,918
What?

146
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:20,088
<i>Nothing. The book is phenomenal,
sweetie, but...</i>

147
00:14:22,257 --> 00:14:23,509
You don't think it's ready.

148
00:14:23,592 --> 00:14:26,345
Elly, it's just... It's the ending.

149
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:28,055
- Oh, God.
<i>- I'm reading this thing.</i>

150
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:29,348
<i>I'm on the edge of my toilet.</i>

151
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:33,268
Argylle about to get the master file,
defeat those SOBs,

152
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:34,603
<i>and then the big twist is</i>

153
00:14:34,686 --> 00:14:36,104
it's in London.

154
00:14:37,064 --> 00:14:39,525
<i>What? No. No, no, no.</i>

155
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:41,527
Does he get the file or not?

156
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,112
- What happens next?
- It's called a cliff-hanger, Mother.

157
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:45,948
Elly, it's called a cop-out.

158
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:48,909
<i>And you can't do this to your readers.</i>

159
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:50,953
<i>How about I fly in on Friday?</i>

160
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:52,746
<i>Make a weekend of it.</i>

161
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,249
<i>Brainstorm, work a little bit
of our magic?</i>

162
00:14:55,332 --> 00:14:56,792
<i>We'll figure it out.</i>

163
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:02,631
Friday's fine. I'll just...

164
00:15:02,714 --> 00:15:04,508
I'll futz around with it until then.

165
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:06,969
You need to bring this story home, Elly.

166
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:12,140
Yeah, I think you have one more
teeny tiny chapter to write.

167
00:15:12,808 --> 00:15:13,934
<i>It'll be fun.</i>

168
00:15:15,644 --> 00:15:16,645
<i>Bye.</i>

169
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:21,358
You hear that, buddy?

170
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:24,278
One more chapter.

171
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:27,197
<i>Miss Li,</i>

172
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,868
the next flight to London
doesn't leave until morning.

173
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:35,205
Seeing as I have time to kill,

174
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:37,833
- I thought...
- Thought what?

175
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:40,544
That I'd stay here?

176
00:15:41,044 --> 00:15:42,504
Enjoy the fireworks with you?

177
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,766
I'll show you fireworks.

178
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:13,285
No.

179
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,704
That was bad.

180
00:16:16,747 --> 00:16:17,789
God, that was bad.

181
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,625
Delete.

182
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,335
You're better than this, Elly.

183
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:23,420
Come on, Elly.

184
00:16:25,088 --> 00:16:27,382
- The whole tone...
- Is just...

185
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:28,800
It's way off.

186
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:30,552
Okay.

187
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:36,517
"What I meant to say, Miss Li, was"...

188
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:46,109
What I meant to say, Miss Li, was...

189
00:16:47,277 --> 00:16:48,612
"Was"...

190
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:10,384
- I've got n...
- Nothing.

191
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:20,561
What about you, Alfie?

192
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:22,980
Any thoughts?

193
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,023
Anything?

194
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:32,781
Hey, Mom.

195
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:35,576
<i>Hi, dear. Just wanna make sure
you're okay.</i>

196
00:17:35,658 --> 00:17:37,619
I know how stressed you get
with work and...

197
00:17:37,703 --> 00:17:39,454
Tickets, please. Tickets.

198
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:41,206
Wait, Elly.

199
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,791
Are you on a train?

200
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:45,127
Surprise.

201
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,504
<i>I figured I'd just come down to the city
to see you.</i>

202
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:50,382
Well, your father will be so excited
to see you.

203
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:52,426
<i>And dear little Alfie, of course.</i>

204
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:54,178
We'll take you out for a nice dinner.

205
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:56,972
Maybe you'll even meet someone
while you're here, who knows?

206
00:17:57,055 --> 00:18:02,227
As appealing as that sounds, Mother,
I am in a relationship.

207
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:03,937
You are?

208
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:05,147
<i>With who?</i>

209
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,274
A relationship with my work.

210
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,068
With Argylle.

211
00:18:10,152 --> 00:18:12,112
<i>It kills me, Elly.</i>

212
00:18:12,196 --> 00:18:15,490
What is the point of success
if you have no one to enjoy it with?

213
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:19,411
There's a reason I write about spies,
not romance, Mother.

214
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:22,623
It's less complicated.

215
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:24,249
<i>- What's so complicated...</i>
- Yeah.

216
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,626
<i>...about falling in love, Elly?</i>

217
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:27,794
I'll call you when I get in, yeah?

218
00:18:27,878 --> 00:18:29,505
Love you. Bye.

219
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:30,756
Hi.

220
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:33,967
Sorry to disturb. Is this seat taken?

221
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:36,053
Is that seat taken?

222
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:44,686
Yes. Yes, unfortunately, it is.

223
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:47,314
That's a shame.

224
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:06,750
I'm sorry, no. No. That seat is taken.

225
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:10,128
He got up, but a man was...

226
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:12,381
is sitting there.

227
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:14,800
That's fine. If he comes back,
I'll just get up.

228
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:17,845
Hey! There's a cat in there.

229
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:20,180
This cat's supposed to be in a hat,
not in a backpack.

230
00:19:20,264 --> 00:19:21,723
Look at this.

231
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:24,351
What are you doing, fur monster? Far out.

232
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:27,396
I love cats. What's his name?

233
00:19:28,313 --> 00:19:30,732
- Excuse me.
- Alfie.

234
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:33,277
Alfie boy. Ooh, yeah.

235
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,946
Coochy-coochy-coochy-coochy-coo.

236
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:39,533
Is enough oxygen in there?

237
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:40,659
Yes, of course.

238
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,375
I'll leave you alone.
You wanna be left alone. I understand.

239
00:19:50,544 --> 00:19:51,879
Have you read this?

240
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:57,050
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

241
00:19:58,093 --> 00:19:59,136
Okay.

242
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,931
I get it. Okay.

243
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:23,452
{\an8}Wait...

244
00:20:29,374 --> 00:20:30,751
Excuse me.

245
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:34,254
Oh, my God. Are you... Is this?

246
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:36,548
You're Elly freaking Conway.

247
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:38,091
Far out!

248
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:41,345
How about that?

249
00:20:41,428 --> 00:20:45,015
I am such a fan,
and this is honest to God your best yet.

250
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:46,099
I'm not just saying that.

251
00:20:46,183 --> 00:20:47,684
How do you do it?

252
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:49,978
Book after book,
you just crank 'em out, man.

253
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:53,524
You know, when you're passionate
about what you do...

254
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:56,318
You never work a day in your life.

255
00:20:56,401 --> 00:20:57,861
Ain't that the truth?

256
00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:00,781
We're both lucky that way, you and I.

257
00:21:01,281 --> 00:21:03,033
Oh, yeah? What is it you do?

258
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:04,701
Espionage.

259
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:07,496
Right.

260
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:11,542
"The greater the spy, the bigger the lie."

261
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:13,710
That's cheeky.

262
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:18,465
Not what you expected
a spy to look like, huh?

263
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:22,886
Well, yeah, in fairness, that is just
about the only thing your books get wrong.

264
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,849
A male model in a bespoke Nehru jacket
with a stupid haircut

265
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:31,520
tends to stand out on a train
as opposed to everyone else in this car.

266
00:21:34,898 --> 00:21:37,484
Them you don't notice.

267
00:21:40,487 --> 00:21:41,738
Have I lost you?

268
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:44,366
You all right?

269
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,579
No, I'm fine.

270
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:51,248
You know, I meant it
when I said I was a fan.

271
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:52,708
But the next fan that comes over,

272
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:55,294
he's not just dropping by for a selfie,
if you catch my drift.

273
00:21:55,377 --> 00:21:56,628
He's one of them.

274
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:59,214
- Now, I realize this may be...
- ...hard to believe,

275
00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:01,091
but by the time I've broken his wrists...

276
00:22:01,175 --> 00:22:02,801
...and his pistol falls into your lap,

277
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:05,029
perhaps we will have built up
a little trust with one another...

278
00:22:05,053 --> 00:22:07,472
...and you'll be able to accept
two key realities.

279
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:10,976
Reality one, you are in grave danger.

280
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:13,979
- Reality...
- ...two, when I say it's time,

281
00:22:14,062 --> 00:22:17,482
it would really be beneficial for you
to hold on to me as tight as you can.

282
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:18,400
I'm talking...

283
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:21,945
...bear-hug-like-you've-
never-held-anyone-before tight.

284
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:24,655
You understand?

285
00:22:25,365 --> 00:22:26,575
You dig what I'm saying?

286
00:22:27,576 --> 00:22:30,412
I am so sorry.

287
00:22:30,495 --> 00:22:33,499
Miss Conway,
would you mind signing my book?

288
00:22:33,582 --> 00:22:35,250
We're really gonna play this game?

289
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:36,335
Yeah.

290
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:38,003
Do you have a pen?

291
00:22:38,086 --> 00:22:39,963
- It's embarrassing.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

292
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:43,884
Here we go.

293
00:22:46,762 --> 00:22:48,138
God, I love this book.

294
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:03,562
See? I was telling the truth.

295
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,739
Who's the weirdo now?

296
00:23:07,824 --> 00:23:10,869
Not a real fan. Don't worry.
I have it all under control.

297
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:13,580
I got everything under control.

298
00:23:30,347 --> 00:23:31,640
What is happening?

299
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:36,270
Are you okay?

300
00:23:36,353 --> 00:23:37,604
Yeah.

301
00:24:20,814 --> 00:24:23,066
Gee, that's nice. Thanks.

302
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:25,944
See?

303
00:24:26,028 --> 00:24:28,614
I give you the gun,
you give it back to me.

304
00:24:28,697 --> 00:24:30,616
This is that trust
we were talking about, Elly.

305
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:32,659
Strangers on a train.

306
00:24:32,743 --> 00:24:33,869
And now look at us.

307
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:35,913
Come on. Isn't this fun?

308
00:24:44,546 --> 00:24:46,590
Wait a second. No, no, no.

309
00:24:47,382 --> 00:24:49,176
Elly, hold on. Don't do that.

310
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:13,407
Elly!

311
00:25:28,465 --> 00:25:30,092
It's a real beard, you dick.

312
00:25:31,385 --> 00:25:32,970
Hey, hey, hey.

313
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:48,109
You okay?

314
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:49,403
No!

315
00:25:49,486 --> 00:25:51,154
Okay, I'm gonna take care of this.

316
00:25:56,326 --> 00:25:58,078
Okay, this could be a challenging...

317
00:26:25,147 --> 00:26:26,147
Okay.

318
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:40,746
All right, I think it's
bear hug o'clock time. Follow me.

319
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:41,830
Let's go.

320
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:45,834
Okay. Hey, stay with me. Follow me.

321
00:26:45,918 --> 00:26:46,919
Okay.

322
00:26:47,503 --> 00:26:49,338
Let's go.

323
00:26:49,421 --> 00:26:51,006
- Hey.
- No. Bad.

324
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:52,466
Bad. Very bad.

325
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:54,259
Let's go. Let's go.

326
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:06,271
- Hey, wait. That's your type?
- Get lost, Romeo.

327
00:27:06,355 --> 00:27:07,356
No!

328
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:11,652
Freeze!

329
00:27:11,735 --> 00:27:13,612
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Don't shoot.

330
00:27:13,695 --> 00:27:16,090
I don't know this man.
I have nothing to do with this person.

331
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:17,366
I'm not involved. Please.

332
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:19,243
Wilde, don't make me kill both of you.

333
00:27:19,326 --> 00:27:20,536
Hey, Elly.

334
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,454
What?

335
00:27:22,538 --> 00:27:23,872
It's time.

336
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:26,041
It's bear hug o'clock.

337
00:27:26,124 --> 00:27:27,835
Enjoy the ride.

338
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:33,215
Yeah!

339
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:35,884
Okay!

340
00:27:55,445 --> 00:27:56,446
What?

341
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:09,918
Good, you're up. Hey.

342
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:14,798
Okay, it's me. It's just me.

343
00:28:14,882 --> 00:28:18,218
Remember the guy on the train?
The kung fu...

344
00:28:18,302 --> 00:28:19,386
With the beard?

345
00:28:20,596 --> 00:28:21,597
I shaved.

346
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,240
The guy from the train. Yeah, remember?

347
00:28:23,307 --> 00:28:25,517
I know. I recognize you.

348
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:29,688
I'm sorry. I'm being rude. I apologize.

349
00:28:29,771 --> 00:28:32,983
We haven't been formally introduced.
My name's Aidan. Aidan Wilde.

350
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:34,276
No, no, no! Stay back.

351
00:28:35,402 --> 00:28:36,445
Okay. Relax.

352
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:38,822
Where's my cat?

353
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:42,659
Alfie's right over there in the kitchen
eating mercury-free tuna.

354
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:45,162
Just like Mom feeds him.

355
00:28:45,746 --> 00:28:47,789
He's fine. You're not.

356
00:28:48,582 --> 00:28:50,083
You're in big, big trouble.

357
00:28:51,502 --> 00:28:52,503
You...

358
00:28:53,754 --> 00:28:55,714
You have cameras in my house?

359
00:28:55,797 --> 00:28:58,008
You're not a spy, you're a pervert.

360
00:28:58,091 --> 00:29:00,219
No, not a pervert. A spy.

361
00:29:00,302 --> 00:29:02,513
I'm a spy, doing my job.
I'm not a pervert.

362
00:29:02,596 --> 00:29:04,973
That's the bad guys' feed
that we're tapped into.

363
00:29:05,557 --> 00:29:08,519
Well, then, who are these people?

364
00:29:08,602 --> 00:29:10,354
You see that guy right there?

365
00:29:11,021 --> 00:29:12,564
<i>You remember him from the train?</i>

366
00:29:12,648 --> 00:29:14,316
<i>His name's Carlos.</i>

367
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,109
<i>He works for the Division,</i>

368
00:29:16,193 --> 00:29:20,322
<i>the real-life version
of those bad-guy spies in your books.</i>

369
00:29:21,073 --> 00:29:24,368
<i>And the head honcho.
He's called Director Ritter.</i>

370
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:29,581
Do I need to remind you
what is at stake here?

371
00:29:30,499 --> 00:29:37,422
What would happen if that turncoat
son of a bitch masquerading as an agent

372
00:29:37,506 --> 00:29:39,967
were to recover our master file
before we do?

373
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,886
I'll find her. You have my word.

374
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,346
Deputy Director,

375
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:48,308
is that like when you gave me your word

376
00:29:48,392 --> 00:29:51,436
Wilde would never get
within a hundred miles from her?

377
00:29:53,146 --> 00:29:55,023
We can still contain this, sir.

378
00:29:55,107 --> 00:29:57,734
I'm overwhelmed with confidence.

379
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:03,198
<i>No, this doesn't make sense.
Why would the Division care about me?</i>

380
00:30:03,282 --> 00:30:05,993
Because you're
a goddamn fortune teller, Elly.

381
00:30:06,743 --> 00:30:07,911
I mean, come on.

382
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:12,499
It doesn't take a genius to imagine
a covert intel organization

383
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:14,168
the world doesn't know about.

384
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:16,670
It sure as shit does
to predict they'd go rogue.

385
00:30:17,504 --> 00:30:18,589
Yeah.

386
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,760
Somehow, you wrote a story that's
still unfolding as we speak. Book five.

387
00:30:23,844 --> 00:30:25,345
You read book five?

388
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:27,848
Oh, yeah.

389
00:30:27,931 --> 00:30:29,308
The bad guys too.

390
00:30:31,185 --> 00:30:34,646
The Division has read book five?

391
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,584
The Division doesn't miss
a single keystroke of yours, Elly.

392
00:30:37,608 --> 00:30:40,652
But your new manuscript kicked a hornet's
nest you didn't even know existed.

393
00:30:40,736 --> 00:30:42,196
That's why the Division wants you,

394
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:45,824
and once they have you,
they're never gonna let you go, or worse.

395
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:48,785
Much, much worse.

396
00:30:50,746 --> 00:30:51,747
Clementine...

397
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,792
you're my only comfort.

398
00:30:57,794 --> 00:31:01,840
Did you know that Clementine
was my grandfather's?

399
00:31:02,424 --> 00:31:03,424
Yeah.

400
00:31:04,468 --> 00:31:06,053
He named it after his mother.

401
00:31:06,136 --> 00:31:07,346
Oh, boy.

402
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,016
He was a very strict man.

403
00:31:12,142 --> 00:31:14,144
But I always found him reasonable.

404
00:31:20,317 --> 00:31:22,152
And he had a policy.

405
00:31:22,236 --> 00:31:25,364
He would only kill
if it was absolutely necessary...

406
00:31:26,782 --> 00:31:28,242
for food

407
00:31:28,742 --> 00:31:31,245
or to vanquish an enemy

408
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,083
or to eliminate an incompetent imbecile.

409
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:39,336
Mistakes were made. It won't happen again.

410
00:31:40,712 --> 00:31:42,214
I know it won't.

411
00:31:44,132 --> 00:31:46,260
Of that I'm certain.

412
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:51,306
This isn't happening.

413
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,308
Yeah, it is. It's definitely happening.

414
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:57,622
But if you want a way out, if you want
your life back, I can help you.

415
00:31:57,646 --> 00:31:59,022
I'm the good guy here.

416
00:31:59,106 --> 00:32:00,649
But you gotta help me first.

417
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:04,570
What exactly is it you need me to do?

418
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:07,197
I'll tell you on the way.

419
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,125
Goddamn, cats!

420
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,419
Had to bring your cat, man.

421
00:32:20,502 --> 00:32:22,087
I thought you said you loved cats.

422
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:23,755
You have a hankie or a pocket square?

423
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:26,091
What, do you have allergies or something?

424
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:28,552
Never mind. It's fine.

425
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:31,638
You lied.

426
00:32:31,722 --> 00:32:34,183
You lied about liking cats.

427
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:35,952
- Yeah.
- How am I supposed to trust you now?

428
00:32:35,976 --> 00:32:38,312
I'm a spy. Spies lie.

429
00:32:38,395 --> 00:32:39,605
It's part of the gig.

430
00:32:39,688 --> 00:32:41,523
That and killing people.

431
00:32:41,607 --> 00:32:43,817
That's really reassuring.

432
00:32:45,694 --> 00:32:47,863
Okay, you want truth? Here's truth.

433
00:32:47,946 --> 00:32:50,616
What you wrote in your new manuscript
actually happened.

434
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:53,118
But it wasn't Argylle, it was me.

435
00:32:54,077 --> 00:32:55,370
I brought in this hacker.

436
00:32:55,454 --> 00:32:59,708
Hired this scumbag called Bakunin
to steal the Division's master file.

437
00:33:02,294 --> 00:33:05,964
Yeah, I've got all the dirt on 'em.
Everyone you asked for.

438
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,966
Ritter, Carlos.

439
00:33:08,717 --> 00:33:12,721
I've got proof of bombings,
election fraud, radioactive poisonings.

440
00:33:13,305 --> 00:33:16,558
I mean, these lot make Darth Vader
look like Mary Poppins.

441
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:21,188
I've put your precious master file
on a flash drive.

442
00:33:23,357 --> 00:33:25,150
I reckon the Division
will give me a lot more

443
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:26,902
not to give this silver bullet to you.

444
00:33:27,986 --> 00:33:30,906
So, the price just tripled.

445
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:33,534
We still got a deal?

446
00:33:33,617 --> 00:33:35,911
<i>Yeah, okay, Bakunin, we got a deal.</i>

447
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:37,371
Yeah, I thought so.

448
00:33:38,956 --> 00:33:40,332
<i>Spasibo.</i>

449
00:33:40,415 --> 00:33:43,418
The master file was my silver bullet
to bring the Division down,

450
00:33:43,502 --> 00:33:45,337
the proof I was gonna use to expose them.

451
00:33:46,255 --> 00:33:49,758
But when I went to London to meet Bakunin,
scumbag didn't show.

452
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:54,012
So now the bad guys and I
are racing to find him.

453
00:33:54,096 --> 00:33:58,642
And we both think that
your fantastic imagination is the key.

454
00:34:00,435 --> 00:34:01,562
So where is he now?

455
00:34:01,645 --> 00:34:05,357
No, no, no. You can't expect me
to know the answer to that.

456
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,775
Why not?

457
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:08,628
Just tell me what happens
in the next chapter.

458
00:34:08,652 --> 00:34:13,031
What you're asking me to do
takes months of research.

459
00:34:13,115 --> 00:34:14,199
Years.

460
00:34:14,783 --> 00:34:18,745
Reading, interviewing,
memorizing maps, getting to know a city.

461
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:20,956
I've never even been to London before.

462
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:22,374
Well, great.

463
00:34:22,457 --> 00:34:25,544
Let's start there. Yes.

464
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:30,757
I don't do planes.
I met you on a train for a reason.

465
00:34:30,841 --> 00:34:33,843
The chances of you dying in a plane crash
are, like, one in 11 million.

466
00:34:33,927 --> 00:34:36,763
Chances if you stay here and let
the Division find you, not so good.

467
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:38,765
Right now, that plane is your best friend.

468
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
What do you say?

469
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:42,227
I can't do this.

470
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:46,939
Breathe. Breathe with me.

471
00:34:54,615 --> 00:34:55,657
Delicious.

472
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,035
- More champagne, sir?
- Oh, no, I couldn't.

473
00:34:58,118 --> 00:34:59,745
Okay. Twisted my arm.

474
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,039
How about this plane, huh?

475
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:04,222
I've never been on a plane before, so...

476
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:06,959
Well, this is one hell of a way
to pop that cherry.

477
00:35:07,628 --> 00:35:08,754
You know what I mean?

478
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:12,841
<i>This is your captain speaking.
Please fasten your seat belts for takeoff.</i>

479
00:35:13,592 --> 00:35:15,928
Yeah, like this is gonna help us
if we crash.

480
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:20,057
You okay?

481
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,226
It's a tapping exercise.

482
00:35:22,309 --> 00:35:24,436
It's meant to bring
my stress response under control.

483
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,938
It's what army rangers do.

484
00:35:26,939 --> 00:35:27,981
Oh, God.

485
00:35:28,065 --> 00:35:29,816
You ever try alcohol?

486
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,276
It helps.

487
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,361
No.

488
00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:35,489
Hey, look at me. Hey!

489
00:35:35,572 --> 00:35:36,865
Look at me.

490
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:39,368
One of my first Division ops,
I'm in Algeria

491
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:43,497
cornered in a Sahrawi refugee camp
literally at the base of Mount "Tachat."

492
00:35:44,414 --> 00:35:46,625
No, Tahat.

493
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:48,627
It's pronounced Tahat.

494
00:35:49,169 --> 00:35:51,880
It's "Tachat." It's a... Isn't it a "cha"?

495
00:35:51,964 --> 00:35:53,590
No, no, no. There's no C. It's Tahat.

496
00:35:53,674 --> 00:35:55,050
It's...

497
00:35:55,843 --> 00:35:57,344
It's just Mount Tahat, okay?

498
00:35:57,427 --> 00:35:58,762
Okay.

499
00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:01,807
Now I start free-scaling this sucker.

500
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,183
I'm no mountain climber,

501
00:36:03,267 --> 00:36:06,854
so I know any minute I'm gonna just, wham,
free fall a few hundred feet per second.

502
00:36:06,937 --> 00:36:09,439
Burst like a water balloon on impact.

503
00:36:10,023 --> 00:36:11,066
So what did I do?

504
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:15,696
I stopped worrying about
the ten-thousand-foot rock face above me,

505
00:36:15,779 --> 00:36:18,615
and I worked the three-foot space
in front of me.

506
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:24,830
So, when you feel that fear, remember
to focus on the only thing that's real.

507
00:36:25,581 --> 00:36:27,124
What's right in front of you.

508
00:36:32,296 --> 00:36:33,297
Look at that.

509
00:36:44,808 --> 00:36:46,018
We're flying.

510
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,728
Yeah.

511
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:50,355
We're flying.

512
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:53,859
Thank you.

513
00:36:54,902 --> 00:36:56,153
You bet.

514
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,801
Oh, God.

515
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:21,887
Had to bring the cat.

516
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,848
What did you expect me to do?
Leave him to fend for himself? Come on.

517
00:37:24,932 --> 00:37:28,936
He'd be fine. Cat ladies always die alone.
The cats figure it out.

518
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:32,147
I am not a cat lady. I'm not.

519
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,192
And what's your problem
with my cat, exactly?

520
00:37:35,275 --> 00:37:36,902
He's really cute. He's cuddly.

521
00:37:36,985 --> 00:37:38,403
- He's loyal. He's kind.
- Please.

522
00:37:38,487 --> 00:37:42,699
You suddenly drop dead, that cat's
chewing your ears off within 48 hours max.

523
00:37:42,783 --> 00:37:45,619
Which, with you around,
gets more likely by the minute.

524
00:37:48,163 --> 00:37:49,164
This is the spot.

525
00:37:49,915 --> 00:37:51,750
The Albert Memorial.

526
00:37:52,751 --> 00:37:53,585
Wow.

527
00:37:53,669 --> 00:37:56,755
I showed up right on time.
Bakunin never called.

528
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:00,509
The question is, what happened?

529
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:02,093
It's a good question.

530
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:03,178
Yeah. Yeah.

531
00:38:03,262 --> 00:38:04,262
Yeah, what happened?

532
00:38:04,304 --> 00:38:06,139
It's not a rhetorical question.

533
00:38:07,641 --> 00:38:08,767
What happened?

534
00:38:09,351 --> 00:38:11,895
I can't just... poof...
come up with the answer.

535
00:38:11,979 --> 00:38:12,855
Sure you can.

536
00:38:12,938 --> 00:38:17,651
End of book five, Argylle was on his way
to meet a hacker in London, right?

537
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:20,445
So you just write one more chapter
and tell me what happens next.

538
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:21,697
No.

539
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,991
This is not my process.

540
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:27,703
Well, we're in a public park
being pursued by assassins

541
00:38:27,786 --> 00:38:31,206
hunting you on behalf of the most
dangerous spy organization on Earth,

542
00:38:31,707 --> 00:38:35,419
so unless you have a better idea,
perhaps you could compromise.

543
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,592
Okay, let's find a seat.

544
00:38:49,016 --> 00:38:50,976
Sir, we've found them.

545
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,109
They're at the Albert Memorial
in Hyde Park.

546
00:38:59,193 --> 00:39:02,738
This is live right now.
One of her fans is live streaming her.

547
00:39:02,821 --> 00:39:05,616
That's definitely her. It's Elly Conway.

548
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:12,080
- Carlos.
- Yes, sir?

549
00:39:12,164 --> 00:39:13,373
Deploy a local team.

550
00:39:13,457 --> 00:39:16,752
I want all UK assets repositioned
and fixed on them now.

551
00:39:16,835 --> 00:39:18,587
Get me the audio. I wanna hear this.

552
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,589
Digital lip-read activated.

553
00:39:22,674 --> 00:39:24,092
<i>How are we doing there, boss?</i>

554
00:39:24,176 --> 00:39:27,721
<i>Please. Please, just don't rush me.
I've gotta think.</i>

555
00:39:28,847 --> 00:39:31,099
He's getting her
to write the next chapter.

556
00:39:32,017 --> 00:39:35,145
It's not <i>War and Peace,</i> you know?
We just need a chapter.

557
00:39:35,229 --> 00:39:36,396
Maybe a couple of pages.

558
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:48,909
As Argylle arrived
at the rendezvous point...

559
00:39:51,495 --> 00:39:52,621
he realized...

560
00:40:14,268 --> 00:40:15,811
So, what, is this guy just a no-show?

561
00:40:15,894 --> 00:40:20,440
Why would he give me the phone
not to call? Unless...

562
00:40:21,817 --> 00:40:23,443
The phone is the message.

563
00:40:24,152 --> 00:40:25,571
There. Look.

564
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:36,123
Why put a $2,200 encryption chip
in a $20 disposable phone?

565
00:40:36,206 --> 00:40:37,350
He's trying to tell us how to...

566
00:40:37,374 --> 00:40:38,667
...find him.

567
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,881
Could I see the phone?

568
00:40:43,964 --> 00:40:45,424
You mean the flip phone? The burner?

569
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,176
Yeah. We need to open it up.

570
00:40:47,259 --> 00:40:51,346
If I'm right, Bakunin could have fitted it
with an encryption CPU.

571
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,723
Sure.

572
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:54,141
- Where is it?
- Threw it out.

573
00:40:54,224 --> 00:40:59,771
You don't have it? You threw it out?
That was a clue.

574
00:40:59,855 --> 00:41:02,107
It ran out of juice. It's a burner.

575
00:41:02,191 --> 00:41:03,817
What kind of spy are you?

576
00:41:03,901 --> 00:41:06,945
Clearly, I'm not working
with Agent Argylle here.

577
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:11,158
With this chip, in theory,
could you make end-to-end encrypted calls?

578
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:14,286
In theory. But the person on the other end
would have to have a matching...

579
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:17,206
...matching DiSEqC satellite dish.
That's it.

580
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:19,541
You heard them. DiSEqC database.

581
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:22,336
He picked the chip to lead us
to his satellite.

582
00:41:22,419 --> 00:41:24,379
We find the satellite, we find Bakunin.

583
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:26,798
The question is...

584
00:41:26,882 --> 00:41:29,885
How do we find a list
of operational DiSEqC satellites in...

585
00:41:29,968 --> 00:41:31,094
...in the UK?

586
00:41:35,557 --> 00:41:38,227
Watch the master at work.

587
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,103
You know how to do that?

588
00:41:40,812 --> 00:41:42,814
Keira did teach me a thing or two,
you know?

589
00:41:42,898 --> 00:41:45,084
So, I'm just gonna backdoor my way
into the DiSEqC data...

590
00:41:45,108 --> 00:41:49,613
...base. Every satellite they sell
would have to be registered with them.

591
00:41:49,696 --> 00:41:55,661
If we don't crack this before they do,
heads will roll.

592
00:41:57,204 --> 00:41:59,706
Look at this. Metasploit firewall.

593
00:42:00,207 --> 00:42:03,293
- That's a Metasploit f...
- Yeah, I can crack it. Just hold on.

594
00:42:03,377 --> 00:42:05,420
- Well?
- I can crack it. Hold on.

595
00:42:05,504 --> 00:42:06,964
Challenge accepted.

596
00:42:07,464 --> 00:42:08,464
Almost there.

597
00:42:09,049 --> 00:42:10,676
Almost th...

598
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:11,760
There.

599
00:42:12,886 --> 00:42:14,721
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

600
00:42:14,805 --> 00:42:15,805
I'm in.

601
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,683
Like to see Argylle do that.

602
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:19,476
I'd like to see you try doing that.

603
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,311
So, what do we have here? How many...

604
00:42:21,395 --> 00:42:22,980
...satellite locations are there?

605
00:42:23,063 --> 00:42:25,107
A lot. That's ninety...

606
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,483
...six to be precise.

607
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:27,567
Shit.

608
00:42:28,527 --> 00:42:30,487
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

609
00:42:31,738 --> 00:42:36,201
But he would have picked this location,
the Albert Memorial, for a reason.

610
00:42:46,003 --> 00:42:47,796
- What's the...
- ...closest one to here?

611
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,007
Well, then you're looking
for this puppy right here.

612
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,259
And that... that's the absolute
closest address...

613
00:42:52,342 --> 00:42:53,802
- ...to the Memorial?
- Yes, ma'am.

614
00:42:53,886 --> 00:42:56,805
- Yes, sir.
- Coburg Street.

615
00:42:56,889 --> 00:42:58,348
Coburg Street.

616
00:43:01,894 --> 00:43:05,022
As in Prince Albert Saxe...

617
00:43:05,105 --> 00:43:08,150
...Coburg. I...

618
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:09,753
- ...think we've found...
- ...our guy.

619
00:43:10,944 --> 00:43:12,154
Let's hope you're right.

620
00:43:13,405 --> 00:43:14,781
Writer's intuition.

621
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:27,920
No one's home. What should we do?

622
00:43:28,003 --> 00:43:33,675
Well, I am a spy, after all.

623
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:43,602
All right. Writer's intuition, huh?

624
00:43:54,488 --> 00:43:55,489
Notice anything?

625
00:43:55,572 --> 00:43:58,534
Yeah, Bakunin was loaded.
He wouldn't live in a dump like this.

626
00:44:00,953 --> 00:44:04,248
- Team one, what's your status?
- We're two miles out.

627
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:11,171
No, it's wallpaper over brick.
Does that seem normal to you?

628
00:44:11,797 --> 00:44:14,758
Whoever lived here had bad taste?
Can we... Let's split.

629
00:44:16,093 --> 00:44:17,261
What are you doing?

630
00:44:17,344 --> 00:44:20,180
Look. There's a line. This is a clue.

631
00:44:23,767 --> 00:44:27,354
- Look at this.
- That's Spackle. That's plaster. Let's go.

632
00:44:27,437 --> 00:44:28,522
This is something.

633
00:44:28,605 --> 00:44:32,276
We got 95 more locations to check.
Come on, let's get outta here.

634
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:36,446
No. Just wait. Let me figure it out.

635
00:44:37,322 --> 00:44:38,657
I know this is the place.

636
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,118
Okay, you're gonna waste my time,
I'll waste your time.

637
00:44:42,035 --> 00:44:44,079
- You like to dance?
- No.

638
00:44:44,163 --> 00:44:45,747
I do. Yeah!

639
00:44:57,384 --> 00:44:58,844
<i>Team leader, report.</i>

640
00:44:58,927 --> 00:45:00,596
Sir, we're one mile out.

641
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,851
Can you see anything?

642
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:12,691
Wait a second.

643
00:45:16,195 --> 00:45:20,949
- It's a lockbox. You can pick it.
- Yeah.

644
00:45:21,033 --> 00:45:22,326
- Yeah.
- Great idea.

645
00:45:25,495 --> 00:45:28,582
Will you please give me just,
like, a little bit of warning

646
00:45:28,665 --> 00:45:30,834
- before you start shooting?
- What's wrong?

647
00:45:30,918 --> 00:45:34,296
What happened to all the spy
lock-picking expertise?

648
00:45:34,379 --> 00:45:35,839
That one looked harder.

649
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:41,637
Hey! All right. Now we're talking.

650
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,721
What's this?

651
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,641
This is a boat key.

652
00:45:45,724 --> 00:45:47,351
How do you know that's a boat key?

653
00:45:47,434 --> 00:45:48,519
I live on a lake.

654
00:45:50,479 --> 00:45:54,733
IP addresses, VPN IDs, drop-sites.
It's all encoded.

655
00:45:56,693 --> 00:45:58,028
This is the anarchist symbol.

656
00:45:58,111 --> 00:46:00,364
It's Bakunin's namesake.

657
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,491
It's after the 19th-century
Russian anarchist.

658
00:46:02,574 --> 00:46:05,285
This is it. This is Bakunin's.

659
00:46:06,495 --> 00:46:08,705
Shit. This is his logbook.

660
00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:12,376
Yeah, and it could lead us
to the master file. Look!

661
00:46:12,459 --> 00:46:13,752
You were right.

662
00:46:14,503 --> 00:46:15,671
You nailed it.

663
00:46:17,631 --> 00:46:20,968
- I figured it out.
- Nice going. You figured it out.

664
00:46:28,642 --> 00:46:29,726
I figured it out.

665
00:46:30,769 --> 00:46:32,312
Can you figure this out?

666
00:46:42,281 --> 00:46:43,740
All right.

667
00:46:54,293 --> 00:46:56,170
We breach on my count.

668
00:46:58,172 --> 00:47:02,509
Three, two, one. Go!

669
00:47:28,702 --> 00:47:32,164
- Room is secure. The target's MIA.
- Shit!

670
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,670
God, I hate that cat.

671
00:47:47,346 --> 00:47:48,347
No, no, no.

672
00:47:54,353 --> 00:47:56,939
Why does this keep happening?

673
00:47:59,024 --> 00:48:00,359
There's a guy!

674
00:48:19,628 --> 00:48:21,255
- Watch this.
- Watch what?

675
00:48:22,089 --> 00:48:23,215
This!

676
00:48:54,621 --> 00:48:55,622
Oh, no.

677
00:49:17,978 --> 00:49:19,188
I'm sorry.

678
00:49:19,271 --> 00:49:22,274
That cat just used up
one of his nine lives. Trust me.

679
00:49:24,985 --> 00:49:28,322
- Cat's a nightmare.
- Yeah, it's not his finest moment.

680
00:49:31,617 --> 00:49:35,120
Actually, feels a lot better.
Feels pretty good.

681
00:49:35,204 --> 00:49:37,080
Satchel, please. Thank you very much.

682
00:49:38,624 --> 00:49:41,543
Okay, these Division dudes,
they come in waves.

683
00:49:41,627 --> 00:49:42,628
There's gonna be more.

684
00:49:42,711 --> 00:49:49,384
So, unless you wanna stick around
for a meet and greet, I suggest we boogie.

685
00:49:49,468 --> 00:49:50,469
Okay.

686
00:49:50,552 --> 00:49:52,012
Here, hold... Wait.

687
00:49:52,095 --> 00:49:54,014
No. Come here. Come here, come on.

688
00:49:54,097 --> 00:49:55,390
Come on. Not that way.

689
00:49:58,477 --> 00:49:59,957
- Hold that. Hold that for me.
- Okay.

690
00:50:17,371 --> 00:50:19,081
- Take it.
- Thank you.

691
00:50:22,709 --> 00:50:24,586
- I'm gonna take 'em out.
- Okay.

692
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,298
And you're gonna
stomp their heads as we pass.

693
00:50:28,382 --> 00:50:29,925
- Yeah.
- Make sure they're 86'd.

694
00:50:30,008 --> 00:50:31,008
Got it?

695
00:50:33,136 --> 00:50:34,930
I can't stomp on their heads!

696
00:50:35,013 --> 00:50:38,016
Course you can.
The human skull is shockingly brittle.

697
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,393
What?

698
00:50:39,476 --> 00:50:43,105
It's just like crushing an egg.
Or you ever hit a melon with a hammer?

699
00:50:43,188 --> 00:50:46,483
It's like... You just lift up
your leg and crush.

700
00:50:47,067 --> 00:50:48,527
Like that, right?

701
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:51,989
No, no. It's great. It's fun.
Like the twist. You ever do the twist?

702
00:50:52,531 --> 00:50:58,078
It's like doing the twist. One, two, three
and crush that head. One, two, three.

703
00:50:58,161 --> 00:51:00,497
I don't dance. I don't crush skulls.

704
00:51:00,581 --> 00:51:02,958
Well, then this should be a fun
new experience for you.

705
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:05,043
Three, two, one.

706
00:51:10,424 --> 00:51:11,967
Let's go.

707
00:51:23,187 --> 00:51:26,815
Okay. You can do this. Twist and crush.

708
00:51:27,816 --> 00:51:31,111
Twist and crush.

709
00:51:34,364 --> 00:51:35,199
Okay.

710
00:51:35,282 --> 00:51:36,783
Twist and...

711
00:51:39,077 --> 00:51:40,078
And...

712
00:51:41,997 --> 00:51:44,333
I can't do this. I can't do this.

713
00:51:44,416 --> 00:51:46,502
Elly, what's happening?

714
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,761
Elly! What happened to all the crushing?

715
00:51:56,845 --> 00:51:57,930
What happened?

716
00:51:59,473 --> 00:52:03,477
I did my job. You didn't do your job.

717
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,937
Yes, right. No.

718
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:09,733
- So, I wanted to, I did. It just...
- Yeah.

719
00:52:09,816 --> 00:52:12,903
It didn't really seem necessary. You know?

720
00:52:15,781 --> 00:52:16,823
You were saying?

721
00:52:18,617 --> 00:52:19,993
My bad.

722
00:52:21,662 --> 00:52:23,872
Oh, no. There's more of them?

723
00:52:29,086 --> 00:52:31,171
{\an8}Where you going? Where you going?

724
00:52:46,144 --> 00:52:47,229
That was convenient.

725
00:52:50,274 --> 00:52:51,316
Okay.

726
00:52:56,196 --> 00:52:58,949
All right, wait a second.
Aidan, Aidan, that bar.

727
00:52:59,032 --> 00:53:04,454
This boat. The boat key. This is Bakunin.
This is Bakunin's escape plan.

728
00:53:04,955 --> 00:53:09,042
He must have left a rope
or a ladder or something to get down.

729
00:53:09,126 --> 00:53:10,335
No, we're gonna jump.

730
00:53:10,961 --> 00:53:12,838
- What?
- We're gonna jump.

731
00:53:13,463 --> 00:53:14,298
No, no, no.

732
00:53:14,381 --> 00:53:15,549
We're three stories up.

733
00:53:15,632 --> 00:53:17,926
You were right.
Bakunin thought this whole thing through.

734
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:20,721
- Underneath that tarp is a crash mat.
- No.

735
00:53:20,804 --> 00:53:23,557
- Guaranteed, I'm telling you.
- What if you are wrong?

736
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,768
Look, trust me.
Look where I've gotten you so far.

737
00:53:26,852 --> 00:53:29,229
Yeah, cornered on a roof,
about to be killed.

738
00:53:29,313 --> 00:53:30,731
- Okay, fair point.
- Oh, my God.

739
00:53:30,814 --> 00:53:33,901
Let me ask you something.
You trust Alfie, right?

740
00:53:34,484 --> 00:53:35,485
Of course.

741
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,924
Thank God.

742
00:53:57,007 --> 00:53:58,926
Holy shit. It worked.

743
00:53:59,009 --> 00:54:01,470
- Thank God. Oh, my God. No.
- We're gonna jump.

744
00:54:01,553 --> 00:54:03,639
- Arms out, landing on our back.
- No.

745
00:54:03,722 --> 00:54:05,200
- It's gonna... Like a trust fall.
- No.

746
00:54:05,224 --> 00:54:06,642
- You ever do a trust fall?
- No.

747
00:54:06,725 --> 00:54:08,143
- It's gonna be great.
- Oh, God.

748
00:54:08,227 --> 00:54:09,269
Alfie's all on his own.

749
00:54:09,353 --> 00:54:11,813
- We gotta get down there.
- Oh, God. Oh, my God.

750
00:54:11,897 --> 00:54:13,941
Look at him, he landed like a ninja.

751
00:54:14,024 --> 00:54:16,068
- He's totally fine.
- Okay.

752
00:54:16,151 --> 00:54:18,070
- Ready? On the count of three.
- Oh, my God.

753
00:54:18,153 --> 00:54:20,280
One, two,

754
00:54:20,906 --> 00:54:27,621
- three!
- Alfie!

755
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,261
- Alfie, thank God.
- Come on, we're sitting ducks. Let's go.

756
00:54:42,344 --> 00:54:45,430
- Come on. Let's go. You wanna get shot?
- You're my sweet little baby.

757
00:55:01,572 --> 00:55:03,031
<i>They got away, sir.</i>

758
00:55:11,874 --> 00:55:13,876
I'm so sorry, Mr. Director.

759
00:55:13,959 --> 00:55:18,797
Regret for time wasted
is wasting more time.

760
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,719
Fuel up the jet.
We're taking a little trip to Europe.

761
00:55:34,855 --> 00:55:36,481
When I catch you, Bakunin.

762
00:55:37,482 --> 00:55:40,027
Clever, clever, clever man.

763
00:55:50,996 --> 00:55:52,164
Oh, God, no.

764
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:55,667
Leave me alone.

765
00:55:55,751 --> 00:55:58,420
Finally, a little acknowledgment.

766
00:56:01,465 --> 00:56:04,760
Look who wants to make friends.
You wanna be friends?

767
00:56:05,969 --> 00:56:07,930
Why do you keep pretending I'm not here?

768
00:56:08,514 --> 00:56:10,974
Because you're not real.

769
00:56:11,558 --> 00:56:13,310
Then why are you talking to me?

770
00:56:13,393 --> 00:56:15,729
No, that's the problem.
You're just a hallucination.

771
00:56:15,812 --> 00:56:17,457
You're there because of my stress
and anxiety

772
00:56:17,481 --> 00:56:20,108
triggering a visual coping mechanism
or something.

773
00:56:20,192 --> 00:56:22,277
You're just a character I made up.

774
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,571
Am I?

775
00:56:24,655 --> 00:56:28,408
Yeah, you're a little pain in the ass.
Get outta here.

776
00:56:28,492 --> 00:56:29,618
Go away.

777
00:56:30,702 --> 00:56:31,995
Get outta here.

778
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,040
You are the author.
Your word is my command.

779
00:56:50,514 --> 00:56:51,557
God...

780
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,350
Get outta here.

781
00:56:54,518 --> 00:56:55,686
Cat scratched me.

782
00:56:57,479 --> 00:56:58,689
I wonder why.

783
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:04,194
Our boy used a symmetric-key algorithm
to encrypt it.

784
00:57:04,278 --> 00:57:05,737
Feistel construction?

785
00:57:05,821 --> 00:57:08,115
Lai-Massey scheme.
Straight out of book one.

786
00:57:09,908 --> 00:57:12,494
You actually do know your <i>Argylle.</i>

787
00:57:12,578 --> 00:57:15,539
Yeah, that wasn't bullshit on the train.
I'm a loyal reader.

788
00:57:16,123 --> 00:57:18,292
You're one hell of a writer, Elly Conway.

789
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:19,376
Okay.

790
00:57:19,459 --> 00:57:21,336
You're not a half-bad spy either.

791
00:57:23,213 --> 00:57:24,213
Yeah.

792
00:57:26,258 --> 00:57:27,259
Well, thank you.

793
00:57:28,886 --> 00:57:31,597
The shower's all yours.

794
00:57:35,017 --> 00:57:36,518
You trying to tell me something?

795
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:42,399
Although, I sh... Probably should do that.
Yeah, okay. I can take a hint.

796
00:58:04,379 --> 00:58:06,298
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Leave him alone, buddy.

797
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:10,093
Leave him alone. Come here.
Come here, sweetheart.

798
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:20,729
Hey. Yeah. Yeah, I got her.
I don't know, some fleabag motel.

799
00:58:22,272 --> 00:58:24,149
She doesn't suspect a goddamn thing.

800
00:58:25,234 --> 00:58:27,444
No. Look, she's driving me nuts.

801
00:58:28,529 --> 00:58:31,365
Elly Conway needs a bullet in her head.

802
00:58:35,118 --> 00:58:38,205
No, listen. I bring her to you,

803
00:58:38,288 --> 00:58:42,251
<i>and then we end it. Okay?
I'm done with this shit.</i>

804
00:58:44,002 --> 00:58:48,090
Yeah. No, no. That's it. That's it.

805
00:59:13,907 --> 00:59:14,908
Hey.

806
00:59:14,992 --> 00:59:16,994
What are you doing here again, Leonard?

807
00:59:17,077 --> 00:59:18,453
How much sugar can one man need?

808
00:59:18,537 --> 00:59:21,832
- I don't get it.
- No, no. I'm not here for sugar.

809
00:59:21,915 --> 00:59:25,711
It's your daughter.
Calling collect from London. It's Elly.

810
00:59:27,546 --> 00:59:30,883
- Hello.
- Mom. Mom, hi.

811
00:59:30,966 --> 00:59:33,886
Elly, oh, baby. We were worried sick
when you didn't show up.

812
00:59:33,969 --> 00:59:36,388
<i>What are you doing in London?</i>

813
00:59:36,471 --> 00:59:38,515
Leonard, I'm trying to speak
with my daughter.

814
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:39,975
Can we have some privacy, please?

815
00:59:40,058 --> 00:59:41,602
But it's my phone.

816
00:59:41,685 --> 00:59:44,813
Like it was my sugar.
Did I pester you for it back?

817
00:59:45,314 --> 00:59:46,648
Go home, Leonard.

818
00:59:47,733 --> 00:59:50,986
Elly, wait. You got on an airplane?

819
00:59:51,069 --> 00:59:52,821
<i>That is great.</i>

820
00:59:52,905 --> 00:59:55,449
Yeah. Yeah, well,
not as great as it sounds.

821
00:59:56,783 --> 00:59:58,744
I'm in some really big trouble, Mom.

822
00:59:59,244 --> 01:00:00,829
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

823
01:00:00,913 --> 01:00:03,290
<i>It's complicated...</i>

824
01:00:03,916 --> 01:00:07,252
- I can't say, not on an open line.
<i>- Open line?</i>

825
01:00:08,253 --> 01:00:11,173
So now you're trying to give me
a full-blown anxiety attack.

826
01:00:11,256 --> 01:00:13,050
That's it. Come home, Elizabeth.

827
01:00:13,133 --> 01:00:14,927
No. No, I can't.

828
01:00:15,636 --> 01:00:17,888
I don't have any money,
I can't use my credit cards,

829
01:00:17,971 --> 01:00:23,727
I have no passport.
I just didn't know who else to call, okay?

830
01:00:24,394 --> 01:00:25,812
<i>Well, then we'll come to you, dear.</i>

831
01:00:25,896 --> 01:00:30,234
Barry! Book us flights to London! England!

832
01:00:31,735 --> 01:00:33,713
Do you remember the hotel
that I put you and Dad up

833
01:00:33,737 --> 01:00:34,821
for your 30th anniversary?

834
01:00:34,905 --> 01:00:37,282
Like I'd forget. It's the...

835
01:00:37,366 --> 01:00:41,787
<i>Don't say it out loud.
But book the same suite there.</i>

836
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:45,958
<i>If anyone asks,
say it's a business trip for Dad.</i>

837
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:47,960
<i>One of his dental conferences.</i>

838
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,254
Elly. Oh, my God.

839
01:00:50,337 --> 01:00:53,507
Elly, are you okay? Are you hurt?

840
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,509
- Yeah... No. I'm fine, I swear.
- Are you sure?

841
01:00:55,592 --> 01:00:57,302
- Yeah.
- Okay, then give me Alfie.

842
01:00:58,136 --> 01:01:00,806
You must be starving, dear.
I ordered all your favorites.

843
01:01:01,431 --> 01:01:04,768
- Thank God. I'm so thirsty.
- And you, Alfie.

844
01:01:06,728 --> 01:01:08,730
Look, I didn't forget you either.

845
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:13,777
Okay, now, is this all a tax thing?
Because we assumed it was taxes.

846
01:01:13,861 --> 01:01:16,989
No, Mom. It's not a tax thing.

847
01:01:17,656 --> 01:01:20,367
Listen, were you guys followed?

848
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:22,411
Followed?

849
01:01:24,329 --> 01:01:26,832
Who on earth would want
to follow us? Dear.

850
01:01:26,915 --> 01:01:29,960
I can explain, or try to. Where's Dad?

851
01:01:30,043 --> 01:01:31,295
Down the hall, getting ice.

852
01:01:31,378 --> 01:01:34,089
This whole cloak-and-dagger business,
dear, it's scaring me. Okay?

853
01:01:34,173 --> 01:01:35,424
Now, I just wanna know...

854
01:01:36,717 --> 01:01:38,357
- Don't open the door.
- It's your father.

855
01:01:38,427 --> 01:01:40,262
No. Wait, Mom! Mom!

856
01:01:48,312 --> 01:01:50,063
- Elly.
- Dad.

857
01:01:52,232 --> 01:01:53,233
This damn hotel.

858
01:01:53,317 --> 01:01:56,069
They make you call room service for ice,
can you believe it?

859
01:01:56,153 --> 01:01:57,613
Come here, Ells Bells.

860
01:01:57,696 --> 01:01:59,406
Oh, Dad. I'm so sorry

861
01:01:59,489 --> 01:02:01,033
I dragged you and Mom into this.

862
01:02:01,116 --> 01:02:03,035
I didn't have anywhere else to turn.

863
01:02:03,118 --> 01:02:04,786
Don't apologize. It's what...

864
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:08,248
It's what parents are for,
no matter how old you get.

865
01:02:08,832 --> 01:02:11,001
Oh, my God, you're trembling, hon.

866
01:02:11,084 --> 01:02:12,794
Sit down. Come on, sit down.

867
01:02:26,475 --> 01:02:31,730
It's all going to be just fine.

868
01:02:36,735 --> 01:02:38,362
And what do we always say?

869
01:02:38,445 --> 01:02:42,658
- "This too shall"... Well? Yeah.
- "This too shall pass." No, I know.

870
01:02:42,741 --> 01:02:46,787
But I sort of think this one
might not pass as...

871
01:02:48,038 --> 01:02:49,039
easily.

872
01:02:50,332 --> 01:02:51,166
Okay.

873
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:55,671
So, something I wrote in my new book,
something I made up,

874
01:02:55,754 --> 01:02:57,506
got too close to something very real.

875
01:02:57,589 --> 01:02:59,716
And because of it, a rogue spy agency...

876
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,929
A real Directorate suddenly thought I
could help them recover this digital file

877
01:03:04,012 --> 01:03:06,598
they'd been searching for,
and so they came after me.

878
01:03:07,766 --> 01:03:10,269
Well... how did you get away, dear?

879
01:03:10,352 --> 01:03:13,021
Oh, well, another spy saved me.

880
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:15,399
He promised he could protect me

881
01:03:15,482 --> 01:03:18,110
if I helped him track down
that same file first.

882
01:03:18,193 --> 01:03:22,197
He convinced me he was the good guy
until I found out he was not.

883
01:03:22,281 --> 01:03:26,118
So, I swiped the only lead we had
on this file and...

884
01:03:26,201 --> 01:03:29,037
It's like a hacker's logbook or something.

885
01:03:29,121 --> 01:03:30,831
And came here and...

886
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:32,583
Well, I just...

887
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,628
I just don't know who to trust.

888
01:03:37,462 --> 01:03:39,965
So, now you're experimenting
with drugs, dear?

889
01:03:40,048 --> 01:03:41,049
- Ruth!
- Mom!

890
01:03:41,133 --> 01:03:42,133
- What?
- No!

891
01:03:42,176 --> 01:03:44,696
- Look at her eyes. Look at the...
- That's not what's happening.

892
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:48,432
Elly. This logbook, where is it?

893
01:03:48,515 --> 01:03:49,808
Did you bring it?

894
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:53,187
Oh, yeah. It's over there.
It's in my cat pack.

895
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:54,270
Okay.

896
01:04:05,449 --> 01:04:07,534
You have to go to the police. Or the FBI.

897
01:04:07,618 --> 01:04:12,206
No, Mom, you don't understand.
These people, they have eyes everywhere.

898
01:04:12,289 --> 01:04:15,584
Well, we can't just do nothing.
No, you have to take it to the press.

899
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:17,753
That's what you do.
Take it to Anderson Cooper.

900
01:04:17,836 --> 01:04:20,172
Someone like that, they can...
They... I don't know...

901
01:04:20,255 --> 01:04:23,342
Barry, what do you think? Barry!

902
01:04:23,425 --> 01:04:25,135
- God.
- Pay attention, dear.

903
01:04:26,553 --> 01:04:27,596
What do you think?

904
01:04:28,347 --> 01:04:29,181
I'm just...

905
01:04:29,264 --> 01:04:32,935
I'm just happy
that you made it here safe and sound,

906
01:04:33,018 --> 01:04:35,812
and that psychopath didn't hurt you.

907
01:04:35,896 --> 01:04:38,649
God forbid something happened to you,

908
01:04:38,732 --> 01:04:40,943
I don't know
what your mother and I would do.

909
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:44,047
- I think you'd manage just fine.
- What's happening?

910
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:46,573
Oh, God. Mom, quick, get behind me.

911
01:04:46,657 --> 01:04:47,741
Don't kill us, please.

912
01:04:47,824 --> 01:04:50,077
I'll get you money. I'll get... No.

913
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,454
I... You have me mistaken

914
01:04:52,538 --> 01:04:53,932
- for someone else. I'm a dentist.
- Shut up.

915
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:56,375
- Aidan, don't do this.
- It's not what it looks like, Elly.

916
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:59,378
- Let her go.
- This is all my fault. Oh, God. Dad.

917
01:04:59,461 --> 01:05:01,547
- You gotta trust me, Elly.
- Trust you?

918
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:05,384
You said you wanted
to put a bullet in my head. I heard you!

919
01:05:05,467 --> 01:05:08,136
You take things way too literally.

920
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:09,221
Oh, God.

921
01:05:09,304 --> 01:05:12,182
But I would love to put
a bullet in his head, I mean it.

922
01:05:12,266 --> 01:05:13,267
Enough.

923
01:05:14,268 --> 01:05:17,563
You kill me, the Division will never
stop hunting you. Never.

924
01:05:19,606 --> 01:05:20,607
Dad?

925
01:05:22,025 --> 01:05:23,026
What?

926
01:05:23,902 --> 01:05:26,280
He's not your dad. Don't you see?

927
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:33,510
- And she's not your...
- Shut up, Wilde.

928
01:05:33,537 --> 01:05:35,706
Don't think I won't enjoy killing her.

929
01:05:48,594 --> 01:05:49,595
Mom?

930
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,187
- Let's go.
- That's Dad and Mom.

931
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:01,273
Hey. Just look at me.
Hey, you gotta trust me.

932
01:06:01,356 --> 01:06:03,525
You just shot my mother!

933
01:06:03,609 --> 01:06:05,277
That's not your mother.

934
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,654
That woman just
tried to blow your brains out.

935
01:06:07,738 --> 01:06:12,201
Who's the only person who hasn't tried
to kill you in the last 72 hours?

936
01:06:13,327 --> 01:06:15,162
Intentionally? Let's go.

937
01:06:15,245 --> 01:06:17,164
Come on! Let's go!

938
01:06:20,834 --> 01:06:22,294
Get in the car! Let's go!

939
01:06:22,377 --> 01:06:23,879
- What about Alfie?
- Alfie?

940
01:06:23,962 --> 01:06:26,298
- I forgot Alfie.
- The cat?

941
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:28,970
I can't leave him.
I have to go back. I have to.

942
01:06:29,009 --> 01:06:33,138
- You're kidding me.
- He is the only family I have. Please.

943
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:35,057
You wanna go up there
and die with the cat?

944
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:37,660
Or do you wanna come with me
and hear the truth? It's your call.

945
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:42,523
But there's more bad guys coming, Elly.
Make the call.

946
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,777
What's wrong? You okay?

947
01:07:29,903 --> 01:07:31,113
Am I okay?

948
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:35,033
- Oh, boy.
- You're asking if I'm okay?

949
01:07:36,451 --> 01:07:38,996
My parents just tried to kill me.

950
01:07:39,079 --> 01:07:43,333
My mom, who,
by the way, is suddenly British,

951
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:46,044
put a gun to my head.

952
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:47,796
I have nobody to trust.

953
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:51,049
And Alfie is with these monsters.

954
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:54,219
They have my Alfie and I'm never
gonna see him again, am I?

955
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:56,805
I'm never gonna see Alfie again.

956
01:07:56,889 --> 01:08:01,226
So, I don't know.
I don't know, Aidan, you tell me.

957
01:08:01,935 --> 01:08:06,481
You tell me, do you think I'm...
Do you think I'm okay?

958
01:08:07,399 --> 01:08:09,818
Okay, maybe that was a dumb question.

959
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:14,907
I can tell you one thing
you're wrong about.

960
01:08:16,033 --> 01:08:18,076
You do have someone you can trust.

961
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:25,042
And trust me, you need some rest, kid.

962
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:29,087
I'm not tired.

963
01:08:30,589 --> 01:08:31,965
Trust me, you are.

964
01:08:38,304 --> 01:08:44,228
The greater the spy, the bigger the lie.
Everything is going to be okay.

965
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,900
Morning, sunshine.

966
01:09:33,067 --> 01:09:34,236
Where are we?

967
01:09:35,362 --> 01:09:38,907
<i>Olá,</i> France. I mean, <i>buongiorno, France.</i>

968
01:09:39,491 --> 01:09:41,994
It's <i>bonjour.</i>

969
01:09:42,076 --> 01:09:43,078
That's what I said.

970
01:09:45,706 --> 01:09:46,748
You like France?

971
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:49,793
Tell you what, French people,
they give me the crêpes.

972
01:09:50,752 --> 01:09:53,088
Get it? Crêpes?

973
01:09:55,757 --> 01:09:58,594
I have more where they came from,
let me tell you.

974
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:10,731
Wow.

975
01:10:16,737 --> 01:10:21,867
Well, well. The prodigal spy returns.

976
01:10:26,788 --> 01:10:27,789
That it?

977
01:10:29,917 --> 01:10:30,918
Good man.

978
01:10:32,044 --> 01:10:34,755
Elly, this is Alfie.

979
01:10:35,964 --> 01:10:36,964
Alfie?

980
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:39,760
Her cat... She named her cat Alfie.

981
01:10:40,802 --> 01:10:41,970
It's a perfect name.

982
01:10:44,431 --> 01:10:45,974
For a very cool cat.

983
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:51,355
Alfie.

984
01:10:52,773 --> 01:10:55,025
- As in Alfred Solomon?
- Yeah.

985
01:10:55,692 --> 01:10:59,905
The former Deputy Director of CIA,
Alfred Solomon?

986
01:11:04,034 --> 01:11:07,079
No more tears. I promise.

987
01:11:08,038 --> 01:11:09,039
Thank you.

988
01:11:09,623 --> 01:11:11,500
Would you like to go for a walk?

989
01:11:13,126 --> 01:11:14,127
Sure.

990
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:27,683
You a wine drinker?

991
01:11:28,267 --> 01:11:29,268
Yeah, sometimes.

992
01:11:35,274 --> 01:11:39,069
Pinot noir.
One of the oldest grapes there is.

993
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:44,491
Been around since the Roman Empire.
Grown all over the world.

994
01:11:45,117 --> 01:11:48,662
But you know why the wine we make
tastes so distinctly different

995
01:11:48,745 --> 01:11:53,167
from a pinot made in,
say, Napa or Tuscany?

996
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,835
- Mm-mm.
- Same grape.

997
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:57,421
The difference is where it's been.

998
01:11:57,921 --> 01:12:01,508
A summer heat wave gets you
a more exotic, tropical flavor.

999
01:12:01,592 --> 01:12:05,804
High elevation gives you a...
an acidic varietal and so on.

1000
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:11,977
They're products of their environment.
The <i>terroir,</i> as the French call it.

1001
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:17,733
Can't know what a grape is
till you know what it's been through.

1002
01:12:30,329 --> 01:12:34,082
This is how the ancients
fermented their wine.

1003
01:12:34,875 --> 01:12:38,545
A technique forgotten by history
until thousands of years later,

1004
01:12:38,629 --> 01:12:42,841
when a French farmer stumbled upon
the ruins of vats like these

1005
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:45,344
buried on his property.

1006
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:49,014
<i>Et voilà.</i> What was lost was now found.

1007
01:12:49,848 --> 01:12:52,684
That's the thing about the past,
it's persistent.

1008
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:55,312
It can be buried but still down there,

1009
01:12:55,395 --> 01:12:59,316
waiting for the right person
to come along and dig it up.

1010
01:13:05,405 --> 01:13:06,406
Come in.

1011
01:13:10,077 --> 01:13:12,329
What is all this?

1012
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:15,707
Why...

1013
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:19,211
Why are we here?

1014
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:21,255
Because, Elly Conway,

1015
01:13:22,005 --> 01:13:27,052
it's time for you
to meet the real Agent Argylle.

1016
01:13:28,345 --> 01:13:32,474
Those books you write?
Aidan told you they were predictions.

1017
01:13:33,684 --> 01:13:34,977
Well, they're not.

1018
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:40,566
They're memories of who you truly are.

1019
01:13:47,573 --> 01:13:52,119
Welcome back, Agent R. Kylle.

1020
01:13:58,208 --> 01:13:59,543
This is BS.

1021
01:14:08,552 --> 01:14:12,014
BS! Your friend? Looney tunes!

1022
01:14:12,097 --> 01:14:18,187
Do you hear me?
Looney tunes! I am a writer!

1023
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:20,731
Nothing more, nothing less.

1024
01:14:21,273 --> 01:14:25,569
Regardless of whatever
deepfake nonsense he just showed me.

1025
01:14:25,652 --> 01:14:27,696
Oh, for the love of baby Jesus!

1026
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:30,199
I can't even believe
what's happening to me!

1027
01:14:30,282 --> 01:14:31,575
Stop whining!

1028
01:14:31,658 --> 01:14:36,663
Your name is Rachel Kylle
and you don't whine about anything.

1029
01:14:36,747 --> 01:14:38,540
You're calling this whining?

1030
01:14:38,624 --> 01:14:41,251
You think spy novels are cheesy crap!

1031
01:14:41,335 --> 01:14:45,797
You don't even like cats.
You're a dog person.

1032
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:47,674
I am not!

1033
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:52,554
I am Elly. Elly Conway.

1034
01:14:52,638 --> 01:14:54,056
Well, I miss Rachel.

1035
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:58,227
I'm sorry. You clearly miss somebody
who is not me, okay?

1036
01:14:59,811 --> 01:15:05,108
Okay, fine. You know what?
I never wanna see Elly Conway ever again.

1037
01:15:05,192 --> 01:15:08,028
Car is all yours. Au revoir, Elly.

1038
01:15:08,111 --> 01:15:10,405
Great. Au revoir.

1039
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,621
- What?
- Yeah.

1040
01:15:19,122 --> 01:15:20,833
Let's go. How fast are you?

1041
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:43,397
Hi, Rachel.

1042
01:15:47,067 --> 01:15:48,360
I wanna know everything.

1043
01:15:52,197 --> 01:15:55,993
So, we meet again, Lai-Massey.

1044
01:15:56,076 --> 01:15:57,744
My old foe.

1045
01:16:01,707 --> 01:16:04,751
What is taking so goddamn long?

1046
01:16:05,335 --> 01:16:10,090
I put myself out there in the field
to capture these images.

1047
01:16:10,174 --> 01:16:13,719
There are my results. Where's yours?

1048
01:16:13,802 --> 01:16:17,014
Decrypting a Lai-Massey scheme
takes time, Mr. Director.

1049
01:16:17,097 --> 01:16:22,603
No, no, no. But there is no time.
Everything hinges on this.

1050
01:16:27,274 --> 01:16:28,984
Why all the lies?

1051
01:16:29,067 --> 01:16:31,653
I mean, why didn't you just
come out and tell me?

1052
01:16:31,737 --> 01:16:34,990
We had to let your memories come back
in their own time, naturally.

1053
01:16:35,073 --> 01:16:39,620
Otherwise, you could lose everything
that's buried in there for good.

1054
01:16:41,705 --> 01:16:43,957
What happened to me?

1055
01:16:46,043 --> 01:16:47,211
Okay.

1056
01:16:47,294 --> 01:16:48,420
Last time I saw you

1057
01:16:48,504 --> 01:16:52,758
was the morning you left to rendezvous
with Bakunin at the Albert Memorial.

1058
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:57,346
<i>It wasn't me who went there, it was you.</i>

1059
01:16:59,306 --> 01:17:00,766
And you never came back.

1060
01:17:02,476 --> 01:17:06,688
We still don't know what went wrong,
how things went south that day.

1061
01:17:06,772 --> 01:17:11,151
We just know that you turned up
in a local ER in a coma.

1062
01:17:11,235 --> 01:17:14,655
A Jane Doe,
found on the banks of the Thames.

1063
01:17:15,906 --> 01:17:17,741
Which is where the Division found you.

1064
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:20,410
<i>By the time I tracked you down,</i>

1065
01:17:20,494 --> 01:17:23,038
<i>they'd already moved you
to a hospital in the States.</i>

1066
01:17:27,626 --> 01:17:30,796
<i>Rachel, open your eyes.</i>

1067
01:17:32,256 --> 01:17:33,257
<i>There you go.</i>

1068
01:17:35,425 --> 01:17:36,885
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

1069
01:17:38,762 --> 01:17:41,056
Do you know who you are?

1070
01:17:42,683 --> 01:17:44,685
You weren't Rachel anymore.

1071
01:17:45,602 --> 01:17:47,563
You were a blank slate.

1072
01:17:47,646 --> 01:17:49,523
Couldn't remember a thing.

1073
01:17:50,315 --> 01:17:53,694
So the Division
tried a different approach.

1074
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:58,156
One day, a woman I knew
as Dr. Margaret Vogler,

1075
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,534
Chief of Psyops for the Division,

1076
01:18:01,326 --> 01:18:02,369
<i>walked in with Ritter.</i>

1077
01:18:05,122 --> 01:18:07,708
We're your parents.

1078
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:08,834
Your family.

1079
01:18:10,210 --> 01:18:12,296
- You are Elly.
- Conway.

1080
01:18:12,379 --> 01:18:16,925
A small-town waitress
who survived a terrible skating accident.

1081
01:18:17,009 --> 01:18:20,721
We brought in a few things
so that you can remember who you are.

1082
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,432
They laid it on real thick.

1083
01:18:27,186 --> 01:18:29,730
Look at this, your music box.

1084
01:18:29,813 --> 01:18:32,316
<i>Brought you mementos handpicked by Vogler.</i>

1085
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:38,197
Visual triggers to remind you of the life
they wanted you to believe you'd led.

1086
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,866
Ice-skating award. That's right.

1087
01:18:41,491 --> 01:18:43,660
And this.

1088
01:18:43,744 --> 01:18:45,704
<i>- Lights, please, dear.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

1089
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:54,880
Remember.

1090
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:57,382
<i>Vogler's work was MK-ULTRA on steroids,</i>

1091
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:59,551
Manchurian Candidate<i>-type stuff.</i>

1092
01:19:02,429 --> 01:19:03,514
<i>Elly.</i>

1093
01:19:04,014 --> 01:19:05,349
<i>Ice-skating.</i>

1094
01:19:07,351 --> 01:19:10,103
<i>They brainwashed you, Elly.
It's as simple as that.</i>

1095
01:19:12,731 --> 01:19:13,732
<i>Hey.</i>

1096
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:16,985
<i>Dad. Mom.</i>

1097
01:19:17,069 --> 01:19:19,821
<i>Which left me with only one place to turn.</i>

1098
01:19:20,614 --> 01:19:22,658
<i>Alfie, the man who trained us.</i>

1099
01:19:23,575 --> 01:19:27,663
<i>He opened an investigation,
but without the master file as proof,</i>

1100
01:19:27,746 --> 01:19:31,124
<i>Ritter had him dismissed
as a conspiracy theorist</i>

1101
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:33,919
<i>and has been hunting him ever since.</i>

1102
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:36,797
With Alfie on the run
and no one else left to stop them,

1103
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,424
the Division set about
the last part of their plan.

1104
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:42,845
Now that you're starting to remember
who you are,

1105
01:19:42,928 --> 01:19:46,306
we thought it might be time
to give you back your journal.

1106
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:47,474
Yeah.

1107
01:19:47,558 --> 01:19:51,186
{\an8}So you can finally write all the stories
that you've wanted to tell.

1108
01:19:52,563 --> 01:19:56,608
<i>The journal that they gave you
was a phony, written by Dr. Vogler.</i>

1109
01:19:56,692 --> 01:20:00,153
<i>All she did was give you
the building blocks of your life</i>

1110
01:20:00,237 --> 01:20:02,406
<i>with just enough distance from the truth</i>

1111
01:20:02,489 --> 01:20:05,534
<i>to protect the actual names,
places, events.</i>

1112
01:20:05,617 --> 01:20:08,328
Hoping to get a glimpse
of your real memories

1113
01:20:08,412 --> 01:20:11,498
through the stories
they encouraged you to tell.

1114
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:14,084
<i>Crazy part is it worked.</i>

1115
01:20:14,168 --> 01:20:17,129
<i>You started to write
a novelization of your real life.</i>

1116
01:20:18,338 --> 01:20:20,966
<i>We just had to sit back
and watch it play out.</i>

1117
01:20:22,009 --> 01:20:24,052
Book by book, you got closer and closer

1118
01:20:24,136 --> 01:20:26,847
until, last week, you were on the verge
of giving the Division

1119
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:30,142
exactly what they needed to know.
At which point, they were gonna...

1120
01:20:31,185 --> 01:20:32,311
They'd kill me.

1121
01:20:32,895 --> 01:20:34,730
I wasn't gonna let that happen.

1122
01:20:34,813 --> 01:20:36,190
Not on my watch.

1123
01:20:36,273 --> 01:20:39,776
Wait, so, you've been watching me
for the last five years?

1124
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:43,906
Yeah, I guess I have.
But... No, you know, not in a creepy way.

1125
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:47,117
Just because you forgot who you were...

1126
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:50,829
doesn't mean I ever did.

1127
01:20:52,664 --> 01:20:55,334
I know you better than
you know yourself, kid.

1128
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,378
Who am I, Aidan?

1129
01:20:59,338 --> 01:21:00,547
Well,

1130
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:03,592
once upon a time,
there was a CIA operative,

1131
01:21:03,675 --> 01:21:07,763
just about the finest field agent
Langley ever trained.

1132
01:21:09,306 --> 01:21:12,100
Which is why you were recruited
by the Division.

1133
01:21:12,809 --> 01:21:14,686
And just like in your books,

1134
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:16,188
there was a real Wyatt.

1135
01:21:19,358 --> 01:21:20,859
You're the real Wyatt?

1136
01:21:22,236 --> 01:21:23,612
You're welcome.

1137
01:21:23,695 --> 01:21:25,173
I just... I pictured Wyatt so much...

1138
01:21:25,197 --> 01:21:27,866
<i>Bigger? Stronger? Yeah.</i>

1139
01:21:28,742 --> 01:21:31,578
I guess that's how
your unconscious remembered me.

1140
01:21:31,662 --> 01:21:33,372
I'm flattered, I think.

1141
01:21:34,206 --> 01:21:35,791
There's a real Keira too.

1142
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:37,584
Look familiar?

1143
01:21:38,335 --> 01:21:39,419
Unfortunately,

1144
01:21:39,503 --> 01:21:43,632
Vogler didn't need to change
the way you described her in your books.

1145
01:21:43,715 --> 01:21:46,051
Because of what happened in Greece.

1146
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:49,763
So Keira... actually...

1147
01:21:49,847 --> 01:21:52,266
Well, then let's get the hell out of here.

1148
01:21:52,349 --> 01:21:54,351
Killed in action. Shot through the heart,

1149
01:21:54,434 --> 01:21:56,770
just the way you wrote it,
by the real Legrange.

1150
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:01,984
Book six, I was gonna
bring her back, you know?

1151
01:22:03,026 --> 01:22:08,699
A reader had emailed in this insane,
brilliant idea for a twist.

1152
01:22:13,871 --> 01:22:15,706
More insane than all of this?

1153
01:22:17,624 --> 01:22:18,625
Guess not.

1154
01:22:18,709 --> 01:22:22,379
Agents! Get yourselves down here!

1155
01:22:22,462 --> 01:22:25,132
Lai-Massey just got its ass whipped

1156
01:22:25,215 --> 01:22:26,592
by me!

1157
01:22:30,137 --> 01:22:31,930
The data in Bakunin's logbook

1158
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:34,099
tells us he left the master file

1159
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:38,103
with the Keeper of Secrets,
Miss Saba Al-Badr.

1160
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:39,980
According to the Koran,

1161
01:22:40,063 --> 01:22:43,025
to keep another's secret
is a divinely mandated duty.

1162
01:22:43,108 --> 01:22:45,569
To divulge it, an unholy sin.

1163
01:22:45,652 --> 01:22:49,907
Miss Al-Badr has taken that belief
to a whole 'nother level.

1164
01:22:50,866 --> 01:22:52,951
Now, Bakunin left specific instructions

1165
01:22:53,035 --> 01:22:58,415
that the master file is to be retrieved
by one person, and one person only:

1166
01:22:58,499 --> 01:23:00,334
The agent he was making the deal with

1167
01:23:00,417 --> 01:23:03,629
and an old acquaintance of the Keeper's,

1168
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:05,005
Rachel Kylle.

1169
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,465
No. No. No, no.

1170
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:09,051
If the Keeper is expecting Rachel Kylle,

1171
01:23:09,635 --> 01:23:12,346
she will know something's up
when she meets me.

1172
01:23:12,846 --> 01:23:14,973
I get anxiety. I have panic attacks.

1173
01:23:15,057 --> 01:23:19,144
Only because you've been
systematically conditioned to by Vogler.

1174
01:23:20,103 --> 01:23:23,232
Well, whatever they did to my head worked,

1175
01:23:23,899 --> 01:23:25,734
because I am not okay.

1176
01:23:25,817 --> 01:23:28,862
I can't pull off a spy mission.

1177
01:23:28,946 --> 01:23:32,699
I can't even look at him
without seeing Argylle.

1178
01:23:33,242 --> 01:23:35,369
Yes, Argylle speaks to me.

1179
01:23:35,452 --> 01:23:37,788
And you know what?
I find it kind of reassuring.

1180
01:23:38,664 --> 01:23:40,874
I mean, don't you get it?
I am losing my mind.

1181
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:43,335
You are not losing your mind,

1182
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:45,045
you are finding it.

1183
01:23:45,128 --> 01:23:48,924
Argylle is your subconscious
fighting to tell you who you really are.

1184
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:51,426
Elly.

1185
01:23:52,135 --> 01:23:53,387
Elly.

1186
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:56,181
If you can write Agent Argylle
for five years,

1187
01:23:56,265 --> 01:23:58,725
you can be Rachel Kylle for one night.

1188
01:24:01,562 --> 01:24:02,980
You got this.

1189
01:24:04,898 --> 01:24:06,149
I know you do.

1190
01:24:11,947 --> 01:24:13,323
We can do it together.

1191
01:24:17,494 --> 01:24:18,537
Good.

1192
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:20,664
Let's get you two suited and booted.

1193
01:24:20,747 --> 01:24:23,000
And if you can't remember the reality,

1194
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:26,253
I suggest you both dress like the fantasy.

1195
01:24:59,828 --> 01:25:01,038
Looking good.

1196
01:25:01,914 --> 01:25:03,165
Not feeling very good.

1197
01:25:03,707 --> 01:25:05,000
It's gonna be all right.

1198
01:25:42,955 --> 01:25:44,540
I think I'm gonna need a drink.

1199
01:25:44,623 --> 01:25:46,166
It's a dry palace, Elly.

1200
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:49,628
Alcohol and keeping secrets
don't pair well together.

1201
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:52,589
Two club sodas, please.

1202
01:25:52,673 --> 01:25:55,884
When the Keeper's ready, she'll summon us.
For now, just relax.

1203
01:25:57,761 --> 01:26:00,264
Listen, if you're nervous, that's okay.

1204
01:26:00,347 --> 01:26:02,766
Why would I be nervous?
Of course I'm not nervous.

1205
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:05,227
There's nothing to be nervous about,
right, Aidan?

1206
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:06,311
Thank you.

1207
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:08,272
Of course I'm nervous.

1208
01:26:08,355 --> 01:26:11,400
I'm freaking out.
I'm totally freaking out.

1209
01:26:11,984 --> 01:26:14,736
You know what's good for nerves? Dancing.

1210
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:17,030
- Dancing?
- Yeah.

1211
01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:20,325
- There's no one dancing.
- Just blend in.

1212
01:26:20,409 --> 01:26:21,952
You're the only person dancing.

1213
01:26:22,619 --> 01:26:23,620
What about this?

1214
01:26:24,872 --> 01:26:26,790
Aidan, I can't dance, so...

1215
01:26:27,332 --> 01:26:31,545
Maybe Elly Conway can't dance,
but Rachel Kylle sure could.

1216
01:26:31,628 --> 01:26:34,506
- I can't dance.
- Oh, sure you can. You got it.

1217
01:26:35,549 --> 01:26:36,758
God.

1218
01:26:36,842 --> 01:26:38,927
I don't know. I don't know about...

1219
01:26:39,011 --> 01:26:41,597
Let's get silly. What's this?

1220
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:43,724
This is ridiculous.

1221
01:26:43,807 --> 01:26:47,144
- No, Aidan. No.
- You're not getting away that easily.

1222
01:26:47,227 --> 01:26:49,980
This jet plane's all fueled up,
it's taking off.

1223
01:26:50,063 --> 01:26:51,773
- Can't dance, huh?
- No.

1224
01:26:52,482 --> 01:26:53,817
Then what the hell is this?

1225
01:26:55,611 --> 01:26:57,696
- Remember the whirlybird?
- What?

1226
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,199
Rachel's go-to. Let me tell you.

1227
01:27:00,866 --> 01:27:02,618
- What do you mean?
- Yeah, book four.

1228
01:27:02,701 --> 01:27:04,494
- No, no, no.
- Yeah. It's happening.

1229
01:27:04,578 --> 01:27:05,871
No, no, no, no, no.

1230
01:27:28,352 --> 01:27:29,353
It's my song.

1231
01:27:29,937 --> 01:27:30,938
No.

1232
01:27:32,439 --> 01:27:33,649
Our song.

1233
01:27:35,025 --> 01:27:36,401
This was our song.

1234
01:27:36,944 --> 01:27:38,153
What do you mean?

1235
01:27:40,531 --> 01:27:42,241
Started in Mogadishu.

1236
01:27:43,283 --> 01:27:45,285
Agents in the field, the heat of battle.

1237
01:27:46,119 --> 01:27:48,997
It happens,
and it happened again and again.

1238
01:27:51,208 --> 01:27:53,919
We just kept finding ways
to find each other, I guess.

1239
01:27:55,629 --> 01:27:58,131
How long were we...

1240
01:28:01,176 --> 01:28:02,719
Till the day you disappeared.

1241
01:28:07,307 --> 01:28:10,102
When I tell you
the second I saw you on that train...

1242
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:15,607
that's been the toughest part.

1243
01:28:16,191 --> 01:28:17,401
What has?

1244
01:28:20,153 --> 01:28:21,905
Pretending not to love you, kid.

1245
01:28:23,574 --> 01:28:25,158
Hardest mission of my life.

1246
01:28:28,495 --> 01:28:32,166
So, we were good together?

1247
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:39,298
Pretty goddamn great, if you ask me.

1248
01:28:40,424 --> 01:28:42,092
Just have to take my word for it.

1249
01:28:43,635 --> 01:28:44,636
No.

1250
01:28:45,888 --> 01:28:47,139
I won't.

1251
01:28:49,474 --> 01:28:50,726
I remember.

1252
01:28:52,811 --> 01:28:54,146
Apologies,

1253
01:28:54,229 --> 01:28:57,900
but public displays
of affection are not permitted.

1254
01:28:58,567 --> 01:28:59,693
- Sorry.
- Of course.

1255
01:28:59,776 --> 01:29:02,446
- We were just wrapping that up, boss.
- Yes. Sorry.

1256
01:29:02,529 --> 01:29:04,239
The Keeper will see you now, Miss Kylle.

1257
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:06,491
Great.

1258
01:29:07,159 --> 01:29:08,869
Just Miss Kylle.

1259
01:29:28,347 --> 01:29:29,515
Enjoying the soiree?

1260
01:29:30,974 --> 01:29:32,601
Yes. Lovely. Thank you.

1261
01:29:33,644 --> 01:29:35,646
The legendary Rachel Kylle,

1262
01:29:35,729 --> 01:29:39,691
pretending to be a timid spy novelist
for five long years.

1263
01:29:40,526 --> 01:29:42,486
Bravo, my darling. Bravo.

1264
01:29:48,909 --> 01:29:50,369
But you must have missed it.

1265
01:29:53,705 --> 01:29:54,748
Missed what?

1266
01:29:54,832 --> 01:29:56,124
All of it.

1267
01:29:56,208 --> 01:29:57,960
The killing, the lying.

1268
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:00,128
Me.

1269
01:30:04,174 --> 01:30:07,302
I'm not really here for a trip
down memory lane, so...

1270
01:30:09,638 --> 01:30:11,265
Of course not.

1271
01:30:11,348 --> 01:30:12,808
Please sit.

1272
01:30:17,604 --> 01:30:20,566
When your job is to keep secrets,

1273
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:22,609
you learn to spot a lie.

1274
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:24,361
Which leaves me puzzled

1275
01:30:24,444 --> 01:30:29,074
because I watched you as Elly Conway,

1276
01:30:29,992 --> 01:30:31,410
I never saw one.

1277
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:35,164
I was deep cover.

1278
01:30:35,247 --> 01:30:36,665
I played the part well.

1279
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:39,334
Too well, it often seemed.

1280
01:30:42,671 --> 01:30:45,757
So, tell me, who are you really?

1281
01:30:46,884 --> 01:30:49,887
Agent Kylle or Elly Conway?

1282
01:30:50,846 --> 01:30:52,764
Because I don't believe you're both,

1283
01:30:53,515 --> 01:30:57,019
and only one is walking out
of this room alive.

1284
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,563
I...

1285
01:31:01,315 --> 01:31:03,066
I don't know what to say.

1286
01:31:05,152 --> 01:31:06,987
<i>Of course you do.</i>

1287
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:11,283
You don't need me.

1288
01:31:12,409 --> 01:31:13,660
You just need you.

1289
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:19,208
Farewell.

1290
01:31:25,756 --> 01:31:29,092
Other than that in my line of work, Saba,

1291
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:31,720
you tend not to give a shit

1292
01:31:31,803 --> 01:31:34,932
what a bottom-feeder like yourself
thinks about anything.

1293
01:31:37,267 --> 01:31:38,936
So, I'm afraid I must ask...

1294
01:31:42,523 --> 01:31:45,776
are you going to give me my goddamn box,

1295
01:31:45,859 --> 01:31:48,195
or are you going to make me take it?

1296
01:31:53,116 --> 01:31:56,286
Perhaps you haven't changed so much
after all, Agent Kylle.

1297
01:32:11,385 --> 01:32:13,220
You're welcome to use my computer.

1298
01:32:14,555 --> 01:32:16,390
And how do I know that's secure?

1299
01:32:17,641 --> 01:32:20,102
There is a reason
I'm the Keeper of Secrets.

1300
01:32:21,478 --> 01:32:23,021
It's because I keep them.

1301
01:32:36,034 --> 01:32:38,453
Oh, Aidan, you're gonna be
a very happy camper.

1302
01:32:39,371 --> 01:32:41,331
Jackpot, Alfie boy.

1303
01:32:49,298 --> 01:32:50,382
Shit.

1304
01:32:54,011 --> 01:32:55,637
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1305
01:32:58,390 --> 01:33:00,392
Hey. There she is.

1306
01:33:02,269 --> 01:33:04,188
What do we got? How'd it go? How'd it go?

1307
01:33:05,314 --> 01:33:06,398
That's my...

1308
01:33:07,065 --> 01:33:09,943
All right, I'm so proud of you.

1309
01:33:10,027 --> 01:33:11,987
Aidan, there's something
I need to know, okay?

1310
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:13,864
- Yeah?
- I need to know wh...

1311
01:33:13,947 --> 01:33:15,490
Who you can trust?

1312
01:33:18,744 --> 01:33:20,662
Well, now I know who I can't.

1313
01:33:21,705 --> 01:33:23,332
Now, don't blame our host.

1314
01:33:23,415 --> 01:33:25,375
Blame yourself
for showing Ritter the ledger.

1315
01:33:26,376 --> 01:33:29,379
And you, please don't try anything stupid.

1316
01:33:29,463 --> 01:33:32,925
Unlike the Savoy, I don't need
to wear a bulletproof vest in here.

1317
01:33:36,428 --> 01:33:40,974
Before either of us could start anything,
the Keeper's men would finish it.

1318
01:33:41,767 --> 01:33:43,477
So, what do we do now?

1319
01:33:45,229 --> 01:33:47,231
How about a nice cup of tea?

1320
01:33:51,401 --> 01:33:52,736
I'll be mother.

1321
01:34:01,745 --> 01:34:03,914
All right. I'll be father.

1322
01:34:09,378 --> 01:34:10,379
You first.

1323
01:34:24,226 --> 01:34:28,438
So, you read what was on that drive,
didn't you?

1324
01:34:33,026 --> 01:34:36,363
You're starting
to learn the truth, Rachel.

1325
01:34:39,283 --> 01:34:41,034
It's coming back to you, isn't it?

1326
01:34:43,912 --> 01:34:46,498
Starting to remember.

1327
01:34:49,376 --> 01:34:51,962
Yes. Remember why you went to Bakunin.

1328
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:55,007
Remember who sent you.

1329
01:34:55,090 --> 01:35:00,929
You found me in record time.
Maybe you are as good as they say.

1330
01:35:04,391 --> 01:35:05,851
Keep going.

1331
01:35:06,768 --> 01:35:08,645
Follow the memory.

1332
01:35:10,939 --> 01:35:12,858
Wire transfer complete.

1333
01:35:13,567 --> 01:35:14,568
<i>Spasibo.</i>

1334
01:35:15,319 --> 01:35:17,070
Then give me what I came here for.

1335
01:35:17,738 --> 01:35:19,156
Yeah, it's not here.

1336
01:35:20,032 --> 01:35:23,952
Don't look so surprised.
Relax, sweetheart. File's still yours.

1337
01:35:24,036 --> 01:35:28,457
It's waiting for you, and only you,
with the Keeper of Secrets herself.

1338
01:35:29,041 --> 01:35:30,042
Al-Badr?

1339
01:35:32,044 --> 01:35:35,422
Rachel, follow the memory.

1340
01:35:36,089 --> 01:35:37,299
Keep going.

1341
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,427
Our business here is done.

1342
01:36:17,881 --> 01:36:19,508
I killed Bakunin.

1343
01:36:19,591 --> 01:36:21,844
- What?
- Of course you did.

1344
01:36:21,927 --> 01:36:24,304
You never let us down, Rachel.

1345
01:36:25,138 --> 01:36:29,560
<i>You were the most loyal
of all the Division's acolytes.</i>

1346
01:36:31,728 --> 01:36:33,021
Tell me that's not true.

1347
01:36:33,856 --> 01:36:37,526
You tell me that's not true.
Tell me that's not true!

1348
01:36:38,110 --> 01:36:39,319
Listen to me...

1349
01:36:44,283 --> 01:36:46,410
Weapons are not allowed.

1350
01:36:47,786 --> 01:36:51,081
But sleeping aids? Perfectly acceptable.

1351
01:37:14,688 --> 01:37:15,772
There she is.

1352
01:37:24,573 --> 01:37:25,574
Where am I?

1353
01:37:26,491 --> 01:37:27,868
You're home, my dear.

1354
01:37:29,161 --> 01:37:30,162
"Dear"?

1355
01:37:31,246 --> 01:37:34,249
Are we still dad and daughter?

1356
01:37:34,917 --> 01:37:39,838
Well, whether you remember yet or not...

1357
01:37:39,922 --> 01:37:40,923
May I?

1358
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:46,637
I do care about you, Rachel.

1359
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:52,768
And watching you these past five years
live this pathetic existence...

1360
01:37:54,061 --> 01:38:00,317
a lion convinced she's a lamb...
just... just killed me.

1361
01:38:01,318 --> 01:38:02,778
Are you my daughter? No.

1362
01:38:02,861 --> 01:38:06,907
But I am the man who helped you
grow into the woman

1363
01:38:07,866 --> 01:38:09,660
you were destined to become.

1364
01:38:12,913 --> 01:38:15,499
But we still have a problem.

1365
01:38:15,582 --> 01:38:16,959
Problem?

1366
01:38:18,001 --> 01:38:19,837
You have the master file.

1367
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:24,216
Yes, but what we don't have is Alfie.

1368
01:38:24,299 --> 01:38:27,386
He will never stop trying to expose us.

1369
01:38:27,886 --> 01:38:31,390
So, please, just let us know where he is.

1370
01:38:31,473 --> 01:38:32,473
Ritter, I don't know.

1371
01:38:33,892 --> 01:38:35,561
I'm not lying. I don't know.

1372
01:38:35,644 --> 01:38:37,771
I don't. It was a vineyard

1373
01:38:37,855 --> 01:38:40,148
somewhere in the middle
of the French countryside.

1374
01:38:40,232 --> 01:38:41,316
Aidan knows.

1375
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:43,610
He took me there. I was sleeping.

1376
01:38:43,694 --> 01:38:49,116
Well, despite our efforts of persuasion,
he won't talk.

1377
01:38:50,409 --> 01:38:51,410
I see.

1378
01:38:53,579 --> 01:38:55,122
I can get it out of him.

1379
01:38:57,791 --> 01:39:00,460
Let the lamb roar.

1380
01:39:04,756 --> 01:39:05,966
I'll make you a deal.

1381
01:39:09,136 --> 01:39:10,137
Follow me.

1382
01:39:12,347 --> 01:39:15,601
You give me my Alfie,

1383
01:39:16,602 --> 01:39:20,063
and then I will give you yours.

1384
01:39:24,318 --> 01:39:25,819
Do whatever you want with him.

1385
01:39:28,655 --> 01:39:30,240
I hate cats.

1386
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,201
Me too.

1387
01:39:36,955 --> 01:39:37,956
Shall we?

1388
01:39:40,042 --> 01:39:41,043
Yes.

1389
01:40:02,564 --> 01:40:03,565
Do you like it?

1390
01:40:04,191 --> 01:40:07,736
We had this reconstructed for when
the director and I were needed on base

1391
01:40:07,819 --> 01:40:10,364
but you wanted to FaceTime
dear old Mum and Dad.

1392
01:40:12,491 --> 01:40:15,160
Agent Wilde here still refuses to speak.

1393
01:40:15,786 --> 01:40:19,248
Not surprising.
But we're going to try something else.

1394
01:40:21,208 --> 01:40:24,086
Aidan, please, tell them.

1395
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:28,090
Or this'll get ugly fast.

1396
01:40:31,134 --> 01:40:32,886
Where is Alfie?

1397
01:40:33,428 --> 01:40:37,307
Are we talking about the cat again?
'Cause, man...

1398
01:40:37,391 --> 01:40:39,518
Kill me. Kill me now, fellas.

1399
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:43,105
If you tell me now,
I promise he won't suffer.

1400
01:40:44,439 --> 01:40:46,567
But the longer you take
to answer the question...

1401
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:49,695
and you will answer...

1402
01:40:49,778 --> 01:40:53,073
that'll be the length of time
I take to kill him.

1403
01:40:54,366 --> 01:40:55,367
Do you understand?

1404
01:40:56,410 --> 01:40:58,912
How about this?
How about I answer your question

1405
01:40:58,996 --> 01:41:01,707
when you answer one of mine first? Cool?

1406
01:41:04,209 --> 01:41:06,545
You don't wanna fuck with me
right now, Aidan.

1407
01:41:07,921 --> 01:41:10,507
There's one thing
I can't quite square away.

1408
01:41:10,591 --> 01:41:13,260
Once you knew I knew the truth
about the Division,

1409
01:41:13,343 --> 01:41:15,012
you could've killed me.

1410
01:41:15,971 --> 01:41:18,515
Could've ended it right there,
but you didn't. Why?

1411
01:41:19,308 --> 01:41:21,602
<i>It seems we serve the same master.</i>

1412
01:41:26,690 --> 01:41:27,774
Cut your feed.

1413
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:34,948
I think it's because...

1414
01:41:36,825 --> 01:41:38,744
you wanted out too.

1415
01:41:38,827 --> 01:41:40,454
Just ignore him.

1416
01:41:41,497 --> 01:41:44,917
You were Division through and through.
You always were.

1417
01:41:46,376 --> 01:41:48,253
It is why you killed Bakunin.

1418
01:41:48,337 --> 01:41:51,340
You killed Bakunin because
you were playing both sides of the fence

1419
01:41:51,423 --> 01:41:53,592
till the very last second.

1420
01:41:53,675 --> 01:41:56,053
You were gonna get that file
and do the right thing.

1421
01:41:57,930 --> 01:41:59,348
I know you were.

1422
01:42:00,265 --> 01:42:01,683
'Cause...

1423
01:42:01,767 --> 01:42:03,352
Elly Conway,

1424
01:42:03,435 --> 01:42:04,853
that person,

1425
01:42:06,146 --> 01:42:08,106
that's not all pretend, you know.

1426
01:42:10,817 --> 01:42:12,694
They can't erase that person.

1427
01:42:18,951 --> 01:42:20,661
All that goodness, that's in you.

1428
01:42:20,744 --> 01:42:24,331
That's who Elly Conway is,
and that's who you are.

1429
01:42:31,547 --> 01:42:35,801
My name is Rachel Kylle.

1430
01:42:45,185 --> 01:42:48,105
We're gonna wanna check his necklace
for a tracking device.

1431
01:42:53,694 --> 01:42:55,195
What about Alfie?

1432
01:42:55,279 --> 01:42:57,447
How the hell are we gonna find him now?

1433
01:42:57,531 --> 01:42:59,825
He was never going to tell us.

1434
01:43:00,784 --> 01:43:02,786
That was a complete waste of time.

1435
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:06,331
Besides, my mind is clear now.

1436
01:43:07,833 --> 01:43:09,168
I know how to find him.

1437
01:43:19,386 --> 01:43:23,223
I checked my watch when we got there,

1438
01:43:23,807 --> 01:43:26,727
so it was at least a 12-hour drive.

1439
01:43:27,352 --> 01:43:29,605
Couldn't have been in Burgundy.

1440
01:43:29,688 --> 01:43:31,231
Let's see here.

1441
01:43:31,315 --> 01:43:34,693
Okay, I'm gonna pull up OpSpecs
for every mission I was ever on

1442
01:43:34,776 --> 01:43:36,945
in the South of France.

1443
01:43:37,029 --> 01:43:39,406
See if it jars anything.

1444
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:42,159
- Not so hard now, mate, are ya?
- Come on, mate.

1445
01:43:42,242 --> 01:43:44,703
- Leave it. He was kind of a legend.
- A legend?

1446
01:43:44,786 --> 01:43:47,456
- Well, yeah, he was.
- Yeah. "Was" is the key word. Was.

1447
01:43:58,759 --> 01:44:00,344
No, no, no. It was him...

1448
01:44:02,471 --> 01:44:04,097
Is that legendary enough for you?

1449
01:44:07,976 --> 01:44:10,812
His car. His car was parked outside.

1450
01:44:11,688 --> 01:44:15,234
French license plates
are numbered by region.

1451
01:44:15,317 --> 01:44:16,944
His was 70.

1452
01:44:17,569 --> 01:44:21,949
Seventy... something. I'm sure of it.

1453
01:44:26,954 --> 01:44:28,121
Meaning what?

1454
01:44:28,205 --> 01:44:32,084
Meaning it is south of Avallon
and north of Cluny.

1455
01:44:32,668 --> 01:44:34,962
It means we're close.

1456
01:44:37,005 --> 01:44:38,257
It means we're almost there.

1457
01:44:39,508 --> 01:44:42,678
<i>Director Ritter, it's clean.
No tracking device, sir.</i>

1458
01:44:42,761 --> 01:44:44,137
Excellent.

1459
01:44:49,351 --> 01:44:51,144
Almost there.

1460
01:44:55,357 --> 01:44:58,193
You can always count on Agent Kylle.

1461
01:45:16,253 --> 01:45:17,880
Almost.

1462
01:45:24,595 --> 01:45:25,596
Found him.

1463
01:45:30,684 --> 01:45:31,685
Brilliant.

1464
01:45:34,104 --> 01:45:35,898
Brava, Agent.

1465
01:45:36,773 --> 01:45:38,066
Better yet,

1466
01:45:38,150 --> 01:45:41,445
because you gave me access
to your mainframe,

1467
01:45:42,112 --> 01:45:44,531
I just sent the master file to Alfie.

1468
01:45:46,033 --> 01:45:47,034
What?

1469
01:45:47,117 --> 01:45:50,871
Because I remember everything.

1470
01:46:00,797 --> 01:46:02,257
Almost everything.

1471
01:46:22,152 --> 01:46:24,404
Alfie, baby, are you okay?

1472
01:46:24,488 --> 01:46:26,448
I didn't mean a word of what I said.

1473
01:46:26,532 --> 01:46:28,612
Okay, we're gonna go
on a little adventure right now.

1474
01:46:39,962 --> 01:46:42,047
{\an8}Red alert! Red alert!

1475
01:46:52,599 --> 01:46:53,600
Okay.

1476
01:47:12,494 --> 01:47:14,913
You gotta be kidding me.

1477
01:47:14,997 --> 01:47:17,374
How are you still alive?

1478
01:47:17,457 --> 01:47:20,544
Remember the last time I saw you?
You scratched me.

1479
01:47:20,627 --> 01:47:22,713
Now look who has a claw.

1480
01:47:23,338 --> 01:47:24,339
Mano a mano.

1481
01:47:25,215 --> 01:47:26,592
Aidan, it's me.

1482
01:47:28,343 --> 01:47:29,970
Okay, I'm putting down my gun.

1483
01:47:31,805 --> 01:47:32,973
On the ground.

1484
01:47:35,392 --> 01:47:37,477
I'm gonna get up very slowly, okay?

1485
01:47:41,648 --> 01:47:42,858
Same side, Aidan.

1486
01:47:45,694 --> 01:47:46,987
Same side.

1487
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:48,280
Same side, huh?

1488
01:47:49,323 --> 01:47:51,116
You shot me in the heart!

1489
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,577
Two words, vascular corridor.

1490
01:47:55,037 --> 01:47:57,498
It's how I was gonna bring Keira back.

1491
01:47:58,248 --> 01:47:59,708
Book six, remember?

1492
01:48:01,001 --> 01:48:02,169
Keira.

1493
01:48:03,378 --> 01:48:05,356
<i>There's a two-inch space
you hit at just the right angle.</i>

1494
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:06,757
<i>It looks like a shot to the heart,</i>

1495
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:09,051
<i>but the bullet
will go through and through...</i>

1496
01:48:09,593 --> 01:48:10,593
I can save her.

1497
01:48:12,971 --> 01:48:14,848
<i>...as long as you stop the bleeding.</i>

1498
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:28,904
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

1499
01:48:28,987 --> 01:48:31,073
Then why are you still alive?

1500
01:48:33,116 --> 01:48:35,661
You purposely shot me through
a two-inch passageway in my chest

1501
01:48:35,744 --> 01:48:39,331
after not firing a gun for five years,
based on an idea a fan sent in.

1502
01:48:39,414 --> 01:48:40,582
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1503
01:48:40,666 --> 01:48:43,126
I mean, I did do the research on it,
but yes.

1504
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:44,628
Yeah, essentially, that's it.

1505
01:48:45,754 --> 01:48:47,798
Who's the fan? Jeffrey Dahmer?

1506
01:48:50,801 --> 01:48:53,136
Yeah, that's impressive.
I'd like to meet that fan.

1507
01:48:54,137 --> 01:48:56,390
Yeah. Well, you and me both.

1508
01:48:56,473 --> 01:48:59,101
Sir, I've found her. She's in the armory.

1509
01:48:59,184 --> 01:49:00,184
Put it up.

1510
01:49:00,811 --> 01:49:02,813
- With Agent Wilde.
- What?

1511
01:49:03,397 --> 01:49:05,649
How is this asshole alive?

1512
01:49:05,732 --> 01:49:09,111
But right now, we have to get to
the server room on the ground floor

1513
01:49:09,194 --> 01:49:11,446
to send Alfie the master file.

1514
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:14,575
Which means we'll have to
make it through every soldier

1515
01:49:14,658 --> 01:49:16,201
the Division has on this base,

1516
01:49:16,285 --> 01:49:21,123
who Ritter has now had enough time
to make sure are waiting for us

1517
01:49:21,206 --> 01:49:23,876
on the other side of that door.

1518
01:49:25,127 --> 01:49:28,422
So, what do you say, Aidan?

1519
01:49:29,423 --> 01:49:30,841
Wanna dance?

1520
01:49:31,425 --> 01:49:34,761
Oh, man. I thought you'd never ask.

1521
01:50:46,875 --> 01:50:48,585
I can't see shit.

1522
01:50:50,504 --> 01:50:53,924
Nolan, I can't see anything!
Give me thermal imaging now.

1523
01:50:54,007 --> 01:50:56,051
Thermal imaging coming up now.

1524
01:52:35,484 --> 01:52:37,819
Open the extraction vents. All of them.

1525
01:52:44,576 --> 01:52:45,577
Come on.

1526
01:52:53,752 --> 01:52:54,753
Carlos!

1527
01:52:54,837 --> 01:52:57,381
Take every unit you have and go now.

1528
01:52:57,464 --> 01:52:58,882
I mean every single unit.

1529
01:52:58,966 --> 01:53:00,175
Yes, sir.

1530
01:53:29,913 --> 01:53:32,624
Hold fire! Hold your fire!

1531
01:53:32,708 --> 01:53:34,877
One spark and we could all die!

1532
01:53:38,714 --> 01:53:41,383
Shut down the pumps. Shut it all down!

1533
01:53:50,225 --> 01:53:51,393
Holy shit.

1534
01:53:52,436 --> 01:53:54,438
He's right. It's crude. It's oil.

1535
01:53:54,521 --> 01:53:55,564
What is this place?

1536
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:57,900
Guns down, boys.

1537
01:53:59,443 --> 01:54:00,611
Knives up.

1538
01:54:34,603 --> 01:54:37,272
Hey, will you check on Alfie? Is he okay?

1539
01:54:41,235 --> 01:54:43,904
Yeah. Yeah, Alfie's fine.

1540
01:54:45,822 --> 01:54:46,823
We're not.

1541
01:54:57,751 --> 01:54:58,752
Yeah.

1542
01:55:05,926 --> 01:55:07,886
Well, if we're gonna go out with a bang,

1543
01:55:09,304 --> 01:55:11,473
let's go out with a bang,
you know what I mean?

1544
01:55:17,604 --> 01:55:19,064
Ice-skating.

1545
01:55:21,149 --> 01:55:22,609
Are those memories real?

1546
01:55:24,111 --> 01:55:27,155
Yeah. I mean, apart from the accident,
yeah. You can skate.

1547
01:55:27,239 --> 01:55:29,074
You're a really good skater.

1548
01:55:30,409 --> 01:55:33,453
The kissing memories are pretty real too.

1549
01:55:34,079 --> 01:55:35,122
- Hold this.
- Do you...

1550
01:55:41,962 --> 01:55:43,380
What do you got in mind, hot sauce?

1551
01:55:49,303 --> 01:55:51,054
Mama's gotta get to work.

1552
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:02,668
Rachel!

1553
01:57:02,751 --> 01:57:06,004
For the record, I hated your books.

1554
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:08,173
Come on.

1555
01:57:09,508 --> 01:57:11,218
Let's write your final chapter.

1556
01:57:11,844 --> 01:57:13,053
Let's write yours.

1557
01:57:16,098 --> 01:57:17,099
Come on!

1558
01:57:17,975 --> 01:57:19,518
Let's finish this!

1559
01:57:44,585 --> 01:57:46,503
Ignore all safety protocols.

1560
01:57:46,587 --> 01:57:48,338
Open fire now!

1561
01:57:48,422 --> 01:57:49,590
Shoot her!

1562
01:58:14,531 --> 01:58:16,074
Now that deserves a kiss.

1563
01:58:17,451 --> 01:58:19,494
How about a hot date in the server room?

1564
01:58:23,999 --> 01:58:25,959
If you need something done right...

1565
01:58:33,050 --> 01:58:37,429
Once we authorize the file to send,
Alfie will get them in minutes.

1566
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:42,809
You really know what you're doing.

1567
01:58:43,310 --> 01:58:46,230
Now this should bypass
all the security system codes,

1568
01:58:46,313 --> 01:58:49,066
- and then it's game over for these...
- Good job.

1569
01:58:51,151 --> 01:58:52,152
Oh, no.

1570
01:58:52,236 --> 01:58:53,946
What? What's that? What's going on?

1571
01:58:55,948 --> 01:58:59,576
She discovered that she'll need
an authorized retina scan

1572
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:01,078
to get into the system,

1573
01:59:02,371 --> 01:59:06,583
and these are the only peepers
that will do.

1574
01:59:07,167 --> 01:59:09,753
Some safeguards we put into place
after Bakunin.

1575
01:59:10,587 --> 01:59:12,172
You were quite a team.

1576
01:59:12,798 --> 01:59:15,050
You can now say that you died as a team,

1577
01:59:15,676 --> 01:59:20,097
and that will happen right here,
right now.

1578
01:59:25,811 --> 01:59:27,062
Jesus.

1579
01:59:30,649 --> 01:59:32,693
Just get him off me! Get it off!

1580
01:59:32,776 --> 01:59:34,027
Oh, shit. The eyes.

1581
01:59:39,950 --> 01:59:43,954
Alfie, you are such a good boy.

1582
01:59:44,580 --> 01:59:48,750
Oh, baby. Yes, I am so proud of you.

1583
01:59:48,834 --> 01:59:51,670
Your little cat assassin
scratched the shit out of Ritter's eyes,

1584
01:59:51,753 --> 01:59:53,172
but I think we needed those.

1585
01:59:54,423 --> 01:59:57,342
- What's the plan?
- I know what to do. Come on. Follow me.

1586
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:01,513
Roof.

1587
02:00:13,567 --> 02:00:15,068
Holy moly.

1588
02:00:26,663 --> 02:00:30,792
This is it. We can bypass the security
using the satellite dome.

1589
02:00:32,878 --> 02:00:33,879
You taught me that.

1590
02:00:34,463 --> 02:00:35,797
You're welcome.

1591
02:00:38,592 --> 02:00:39,718
Now we're talking.

1592
02:00:39,801 --> 02:00:42,221
Here we go, Lakers. Here we go.

1593
02:00:43,722 --> 02:00:45,807
Overriding mainframe.

1594
02:00:45,891 --> 02:00:48,060
Accessing outbox.

1595
02:00:48,602 --> 02:00:50,479
And just like that...

1596
02:00:52,773 --> 02:00:54,107
Good morning, Alfie.

1597
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:02,240
Here we go.

1598
02:01:12,251 --> 02:01:15,045
What is that?
Where the hell's it coming from?

1599
02:01:15,128 --> 02:01:17,464
Agent R. Kylle.

1600
02:01:18,048 --> 02:01:20,843
Gamma. Delta. Bravo.

1601
02:01:20,926 --> 02:01:24,137
<i>Epsilon. Psi. Omega.</i>

1602
02:01:26,223 --> 02:01:27,808
Target: Wilde.

1603
02:01:27,891 --> 02:01:28,976
What?

1604
02:01:32,980 --> 02:01:35,148
Hey. Wha... Whoa, whoa.

1605
02:01:37,651 --> 02:01:38,986
What are you doing?

1606
02:01:43,115 --> 02:01:44,115
Activate.

1607
02:01:46,577 --> 02:01:48,745
Goddamn it! Come on!

1608
02:01:51,415 --> 02:01:52,833
Stop!

1609
02:02:00,007 --> 02:02:01,300
Yes!

1610
02:02:02,301 --> 02:02:04,887
You don't wanna do this.
She programmed you.

1611
02:02:04,970 --> 02:02:06,388
I'm not gonna fight you.

1612
02:02:06,471 --> 02:02:07,890
You're wasting your time.

1613
02:02:07,973 --> 02:02:09,183
Remember who you are!

1614
02:02:09,266 --> 02:02:10,392
Wilde!

1615
02:02:15,230 --> 02:02:17,774
Jesus! Come on. Come on!

1616
02:02:54,770 --> 02:02:55,938
Baby...

1617
02:02:56,897 --> 02:02:58,106
It's okay.

1618
02:02:58,690 --> 02:03:00,192
I just gotta kill her.

1619
02:03:21,255 --> 02:03:22,673
I'm gonna get you.

1620
02:03:29,012 --> 02:03:30,305
Don't make me do this.

1621
02:03:32,808 --> 02:03:34,810
I don't wanna hurt you! Enough!

1622
02:03:34,893 --> 02:03:37,563
I'm afraid you'll have to kill her first.

1623
02:03:39,231 --> 02:03:40,607
I'm not gonna fight you.

1624
02:03:42,943 --> 02:03:44,945
I can't kill you.

1625
02:03:52,536 --> 02:03:53,704
Finish him.

1626
02:04:05,257 --> 02:04:06,884
I know you can't hear me, but...

1627
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:10,846
I love you.

1628
02:04:15,517 --> 02:04:16,518
Always have.

1629
02:04:19,646 --> 02:04:21,190
Always will.

1630
02:04:38,499 --> 02:04:40,584
Okay, babe, you got this.

1631
02:04:49,218 --> 02:04:50,385
Twist...

1632
02:04:56,892 --> 02:04:58,769
and...

1633
02:05:05,192 --> 02:05:08,862
crush.

1634
02:05:31,593 --> 02:05:34,346
You missed. I think.

1635
02:05:35,722 --> 02:05:37,140
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1636
02:05:38,016 --> 02:05:40,394
What have I done? What have I done?

1637
02:05:41,019 --> 02:05:42,855
- What have I done? I'm so sorry.
- Hey.

1638
02:05:42,938 --> 02:05:44,106
Are you back?

1639
02:05:45,023 --> 02:05:46,358
Yeah.

1640
02:05:46,441 --> 02:05:47,693
Yeah. I'm back.

1641
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:49,695
Are you okay?

1642
02:05:50,529 --> 02:05:51,613
Are you kidding?

1643
02:05:51,697 --> 02:05:53,532
Here. Come on. Come on. Get up.

1644
02:05:55,367 --> 02:05:58,328
All right. Three, two, one.

1645
02:05:58,412 --> 02:05:59,621
Up.

1646
02:06:00,205 --> 02:06:02,082
Okay, okay, okay.

1647
02:06:02,166 --> 02:06:03,333
Give me your arm.

1648
02:06:09,298 --> 02:06:10,799
You got me good. Is that...

1649
02:06:10,883 --> 02:06:13,343
I'm seeing two Keiras.
Are you seeing two Keiras?

1650
02:06:13,427 --> 02:06:14,511
I see one.

1651
02:06:14,595 --> 02:06:15,929
Keira?

1652
02:06:16,013 --> 02:06:18,390
Keira! How are you alive?

1653
02:06:18,974 --> 02:06:22,352
Who do you think was the fan
that sent you the vascular corridor idea?

1654
02:06:24,229 --> 02:06:26,690
Personal experience with that one.

1655
02:06:28,984 --> 02:06:30,068
That's the fan?

1656
02:06:31,486 --> 02:06:32,487
Yeah. Come on.

1657
02:06:32,571 --> 02:06:33,864
Though when I didn't hear back,

1658
02:06:33,947 --> 02:06:36,283
I realized you really had
forgotten everything.

1659
02:06:36,366 --> 02:06:39,453
So I burrowed my way
into the Division's networks,

1660
02:06:39,536 --> 02:06:40,871
waiting for the moment to strike.

1661
02:06:40,954 --> 02:06:43,040
And then when I saw that
they brought you in,

1662
02:06:43,123 --> 02:06:46,293
I thought, "The moment has arrived."

1663
02:06:46,376 --> 02:06:47,961
Damn straight.

1664
02:06:49,546 --> 02:06:51,507
Aren't you forgetting something?

1665
02:07:08,482 --> 02:07:09,483
Yes!

1666
02:07:17,950 --> 02:07:19,535
I need you to know,

1667
02:07:19,618 --> 02:07:22,412
I was always gonna bring you
the master file.

1668
02:07:50,774 --> 02:07:54,027
<i>Argylle had timed the charges perfectly.</i>

1669
02:07:54,736 --> 02:07:56,238
<i>As the ship sank,</i>

1670
02:07:56,822 --> 02:07:58,824
<i>and the Directorate along with it,</i>

1671
02:07:59,366 --> 02:08:02,995
<i>he realized that,
for the first time in a long time,</i>

1672
02:08:03,745 --> 02:08:06,373
<i>there was no next mission to go on,</i>

1673
02:08:06,456 --> 02:08:10,294
<i>target to acquire,
or threat to neutralize.</i>

1674
02:08:12,296 --> 02:08:14,047
<i>For the first time,</i>

1675
02:08:15,048 --> 02:08:18,177
<i>Argylle was finally free.</i>

1676
02:08:31,231 --> 02:08:35,736
And now our final questions
for the one and only Elly Conway.

1677
02:08:35,819 --> 02:08:36,820
All right...

1678
02:08:36,904 --> 02:08:37,988
Yeah. Right down here.

1679
02:08:38,071 --> 02:08:41,950
Hi. If we're never gonna get
another Argylle adventure,

1680
02:08:42,034 --> 02:08:43,702
you've gotta at least tell us,

1681
02:08:43,785 --> 02:08:47,289
what do all of these characters do
once the story is over?

1682
02:08:48,832 --> 02:08:50,292
Well,

1683
02:08:50,375 --> 02:08:51,960
I'd like to think

1684
02:08:52,836 --> 02:08:55,881
Alfie got the Distinguished
Intelligence Medal from CIA

1685
02:08:55,964 --> 02:09:00,177
after using the master file to expose
the Directorate's remaining agents.

1686
02:09:02,596 --> 02:09:03,847
Keira...

1687
02:09:03,931 --> 02:09:06,808
Well, Keira always said
that she could be Steve Jobs,

1688
02:09:07,434 --> 02:09:09,686
so I think that's what she did.

1689
02:09:10,229 --> 02:09:13,524
She went out, monetized the tech
she developed for the Directorate,

1690
02:09:14,399 --> 02:09:16,360
and proved she was right.

1691
02:09:18,529 --> 02:09:20,864
And as for Argylle and Wyatt...

1692
02:09:23,242 --> 02:09:24,535
they're partners.

1693
02:09:24,618 --> 02:09:26,745
So whatever it is they do next,

1694
02:09:27,788 --> 02:09:30,499
I'm sure they'd do it
the way they did everything else...

1695
02:09:33,168 --> 02:09:34,586
False alarm. False alarm.

1696
02:09:35,462 --> 02:09:36,462
Together.

1697
02:09:37,005 --> 02:09:39,258
So proud of you. Love you.

1698
02:09:40,926 --> 02:09:42,386
Okay. Next question.

1699
02:09:42,886 --> 02:09:45,097
Yeah, the gentleman,
yellow shirt in the back.

1700
02:09:48,725 --> 02:09:51,520
Yeah. I don't have
a question as such, but...

1701
02:09:54,314 --> 02:09:56,358
maybe you have one or two for me.

1702
02:10:57,127 --> 02:10:59,296
Cosmopolitan with a twist, please.

1703
02:10:59,796 --> 02:11:02,674
Does it look like
we're in a club or a pub?

1704
02:11:07,596 --> 02:11:08,972
Hold the vodka.

1705
02:11:09,681 --> 02:11:10,933
Yeah?

1706
02:11:12,601 --> 02:11:13,602
The Cointreau.

1707
02:11:14,770 --> 02:11:16,104
The cranberry juice.

1708
02:11:17,940 --> 02:11:19,316
Just the twist.

1709
02:11:22,736 --> 02:11:23,946
Coming right up.

1710
02:11:32,412 --> 02:11:35,749
You must be in a lot of trouble
if they sent you to me, darling.

1711
02:11:47,052 --> 02:11:50,347
That... is a twist.

1712
02:11:53,058 --> 02:11:54,059
What's your name?

1713
02:11:55,519 --> 02:11:56,687
Aubrey.

1714
02:11:59,982 --> 02:12:01,400
Aubrey Argylle.
