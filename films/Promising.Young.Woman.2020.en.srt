2
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:33,803
Fuck her.

3
00:01:33,836 --> 00:01:35,371
- Fuck her.
- Yeah. Fuck her.

4
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:37,507
- Fuck her.
- This is how business is done, man.

5
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,842
I mean, this is... well, it's
just a round of fucking golf.

6
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:41,244
You'd think we were
taking clients out

7
00:01:41,277 --> 00:01:42,378
- to a strip club.
- Well... well...

8
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:43,846
Which we can't even do anymore.

9
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,182
Exactly.
We can't even do that anymore

10
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:47,350
- since the Christmas party last year.
- Okay.

11
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:48,818
I think it's because
the golf club

12
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:49,886
doesn't let women play there.

13
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,721
So?

14
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:53,590
So it means we're having
client meetings without her.

15
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:57,627
Look, she should just focus
on closing her own shit

16
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,730
instead of whining about how
we're doing better than her.

17
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:02,398
Jesus.

18
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,467
Oh, hey,
would you look at that?

19
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,402
- Good God Almighty.
- Yikes.

20
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:08,471
Why don't you get
some dignity, sweetheart?

21
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:11,206
You know, they put themselves
in danger, girls like that.

22
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,609
If she's not careful,
someone's gonna take advantage.

23
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:14,410
Especially the kind of guys
in this club.

24
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:18,348
She's kind of hot.

25
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:20,350
A hot fucking mess.

26
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:22,919
Hey. Let's talk to Brian.

27
00:02:22,952 --> 00:02:24,487
I think he might be
amenable to the idea

28
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,788
if we all present
a very nice...

29
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:27,890
I mean, that is just
asking for it.

30
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,994
Oh, look at that.

31
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:33,796
You know, like, you'd think
you'd learn by that age, right?

32
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,765
Where even are her friends?

33
00:02:35,798 --> 00:02:37,433
Just kind of ran off somewhere?

34
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:40,503
Leaving her laying around
for anyone to pick up.

35
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:44,941
Sounds like a challenge, Paul.

36
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:46,776
Yeah? Maybe.

37
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:49,579
- I'll go over.
- Oh!

38
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:50,647
- Whoa!
- Jerry!

39
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,614
My God, I didn't know

40
00:02:51,648 --> 00:02:53,549
- you had it in you.
- To see if she's okay.

41
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,651
- Yeah, no. Of course.
- Yeah, sure.

42
00:02:54,684 --> 00:02:56,451
- Go for it, big fella.
- Uh-huh. Yeah. Why don't you

43
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:58,253
- go see, make sure she's okay.
- We're pulling for you.

44
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:02,859
- Oh, my God...
- Hey.

45
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:04,226
You okay?

46
00:03:06,294 --> 00:03:08,665
What are you looking for?

47
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:09,966
Phone.

48
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:12,802
- Uh-huh.
- It's not here.

49
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:15,570
It's got to be here.
I just had it.

50
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:17,539
Uh...

51
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,810
You think maybe you left it
in the bathroom or something?

52
00:03:20,843 --> 00:03:23,278
No.

53
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:30,485
You gonna be okay?

54
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:33,422
Oh, yeah.

55
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,357
How you gonna get home?

56
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:40,797
Ride... ride app.

57
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,464
Yeah. Yeah.

58
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:44,366
I think you might need
a phone for that.

59
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:47,436
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:48,837
I know.

61
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:51,440
Oh, no.

62
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:54,944
Okay, look, I'm, um...
I'm headed out anyway,

63
00:03:54,977 --> 00:03:56,845
so I can drop you off.

64
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:57,914
- No.
- It's totally fine.

65
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:58,948
It's not a problem.

66
00:03:58,981 --> 00:03:59,982
- Really.
- No.

67
00:04:00,016 --> 00:04:02,018
What are you gonna do?

68
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:04,419
It's fine. Come on.
It's not a problem.

69
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:07,456
Let's go.

70
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:09,491
There you go.

71
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:10,425
You got it?

72
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,761
All right, just hold on
to the railing.

73
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:16,364
- Yeah? You okay?
- Oh, my God.

74
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:27,709
Come on.
I just had my car cleaned.

75
00:04:27,743 --> 00:04:29,044
She's fine.

76
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:31,246
No, I'm not.

77
00:04:32,347 --> 00:04:33,815
I'm not gonna throw up.

78
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:35,050
I don't think.

79
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,485
No?

80
00:04:36,518 --> 00:04:38,019
There you have it, sir. See?

81
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:39,721
She's not...
she's not gonna throw up.

82
00:04:39,755 --> 00:04:41,490
Whoo-hoo!

83
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:47,429
Uh...

84
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:52,501
My apartment is
a few blocks from here.

85
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:56,905
Would you want to have a drink
before hitting the hay?

86
00:04:56,938 --> 00:04:58,507
Mm...

87
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,641
It's literally right here.

88
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,043
You want to have,
like, one beer?

89
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:03,178
Yeah.

90
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:06,381
Could you take us to 242
Raleigh Drive instead, please?

91
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:08,784
It's a couple blocks.

92
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:11,486
Just put the address
in the app.

93
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,421
Put the address in the app.

94
00:05:15,123 --> 00:05:17,659
<i>Kumquat liqueur.</i>

95
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,828
Here we go, milady.

96
00:05:23,131 --> 00:05:25,000
Hey, sorry about
my friends at the bar.

97
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,803
They're... they're assholes.

98
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:30,105
Oh, it's okay.

99
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:32,107
There you go.

100
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,441
You got it.

101
00:05:35,143 --> 00:05:36,812
Do you live alone here?

102
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:40,949
No, but, uh, my roommate's
out of town, so don't worry.

103
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:43,350
- Right.
- Yeah.

104
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,092
- Ah.
- Ugh, that's disgusting.

105
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,135
You're so beautiful.

106
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:02,070
You know what?
Do you mind if I just...

107
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:05,472
- Mm.
- You've got a little smudge.

108
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:08,910
There, right there.

109
00:06:29,064 --> 00:06:30,932
Wow.

110
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:36,604
- I need to lie down.
- Oh.

111
00:06:36,637 --> 00:06:38,606
Yeah, of course.

112
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:40,808
Right this way.

113
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,680
- Don't go to sleep.
- What?

114
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:50,018
Gosh, you're so pretty.

115
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:52,620
Wait.

116
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:55,956
- What are you...
- It's okay.

117
00:06:55,991 --> 00:06:57,491
Hey, you're safe.

118
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,493
What are you...?

119
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:00,895
Hey, it's okay.

120
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:03,998
- You're safe. Shh.
- What are you doing?

121
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:07,001
Mm. My God, your body.

122
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,969
What are you doing?

123
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:10,804
Hmm?

124
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,943
What are you doing?

125
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:17,811
Wait.

126
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:20,981
What are you...?

127
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:36,697
Hey.

128
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:39,267
Hey.

129
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:42,569
I said, what are you doing?

130
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:43,529
Oh, walk of shame!

131
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:46,767
Good time last night,
sweetheart?

132
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,235
There it goes straight up!

133
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:49,535
There you go!

134
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:51,672
- Uh-huh.
- Get yourself some Plan B!

135
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,207
Uh-oh!

136
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,242
- How much, baby? How much?
- Fuck that!

137
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:57,311
- What's wrong, baby?
- What's up?

138
00:08:57,344 --> 00:08:59,013
Can't take a joke?
Jesus, lady, what's up?

139
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:02,582
Come on, why don't you give us
a little smile, huh?

140
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:08,055
- Stop staring.
- What the fuck you staring at?

141
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:10,757
Stop it.
You can't take a joke?

142
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,558
Okay. Fuck you, then.

143
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:47,194
Didn't hear you
come in last night.

144
00:09:47,227 --> 00:09:49,196
Everything all right?

145
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:53,666
I had to work late.

146
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:54,967
Hmm.

147
00:09:56,403 --> 00:09:59,772
I thought the coffee house
closed at 9:00.

148
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:04,977
We had to do inventory.

149
00:10:06,246 --> 00:10:09,615
You have to do a lot
of inventory at that place.

150
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:11,984
You should speak to the manager.

151
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:13,986
I will.

152
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:17,690
<i>You know, I was talking</i>

153
00:10:17,723 --> 00:10:21,094
to Graham earlier,
and he says there's a position

154
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:22,962
opening up at head office.

155
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:23,996
And don't freak out,

156
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,699
but I want you to know
I recommended you for it.

157
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:28,335
- Hi. Can...
- Why would you do that?

158
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:30,370
'Cause you're stinking up
the joint

159
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:31,737
with your sad little face.

160
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:33,172
But I like it here.

161
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:34,707
No, you don't.

162
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,710
No, I don't, but I like you.

163
00:10:37,743 --> 00:10:39,178
And I like...

164
00:10:39,212 --> 00:10:41,381
Hello?

165
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:42,982
...working in
a customer-facing role.

166
00:10:43,015 --> 00:10:45,251
- Great. Can I get some...
- No.

167
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:48,221
- Cassie.
- Don't "Cassie" me.

168
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:49,856
I'm fine. Gail, really.

169
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:55,828
Johnny said he saw you
at The Fallout last week.

170
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:57,997
Said you were completely
hammered and on your own.

171
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,833
He was a little worried. I know
it's none of my business...

172
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:03,769
He must have seen someone else.
I've never been there.

173
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:08,274
Okay.

174
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:13,679
<i>I like your pigtails.</i>

175
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:15,047
<i>Thank you.</i>

176
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:16,716
<i>Hey, you want another drink?</i>

177
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:18,885
<i>Um, I don't think...</i>

178
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:20,786
<i>Hey, let me get you one.
Vodka cranberry</i>

179
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,389
<i>for the lady, please.</i>

180
00:11:23,422 --> 00:11:25,024
<i>Hey. How old are you?</i>

181
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:27,426
- <i>Um...</i>
- <i>Old enough, right?</i>

182
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,093
Can I get a coffee, please?

183
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:04,796
Mm-hmm.

184
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:14,173
You want milk?

185
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:22,215
What?

186
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:24,483
Cassandra?

187
00:12:24,517 --> 00:12:26,986
- Yeah.
- Ryan.

188
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:30,223
Cooper. We were in class
together at Forrest Med School.

189
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:32,491
Second-year neurology,
Dr. Hadid's class.

190
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:34,960
Oh. Yeah.

191
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:36,362
Ryan. Hi.

192
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:39,265
God. Why are you working here?

193
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:40,832
Or...

194
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,968
I didn't mean...

195
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:44,237
That was rude. I didn't...

196
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,240
You didn't mean,
what am I doing working

197
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:49,007
in a shitty coffee shop?

198
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,345
Yeah. No. I just meant,
you know, given...

199
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:55,847
- There's no getting out of this, is there?
- Nuh-uh.

200
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,816
I'm gonna leave.
Can I leave and then come back?

201
00:12:57,849 --> 00:12:59,818
And I can do it...
I can do it again

202
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:02,421
- and be better next time.
- You want milk?

203
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:03,888
Pardon?

204
00:13:04,557 --> 00:13:05,924
In your coffee.

205
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:06,858
No.

206
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:09,528
But, uh, you can spit in it
if you want.

207
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:10,862
I-I deserve that.

208
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:21,973
Thank you.

209
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:27,313
Do you want to go out with me?

210
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:28,880
What?

211
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:32,017
On a... date.

212
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:36,455
Seriously?
I just spat in your coffee.

213
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:51,436
And then I like
to finish always

214
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,038
with a little dab of gloss

215
00:13:53,071 --> 00:13:56,441
just to give it
a kind of wet texture.

216
00:13:56,474 --> 00:13:58,943
Just dab in the middle...

217
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:01,212
and on the top.

218
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,384
And there you go.

219
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:09,220
Perfect blow job lips.

220
00:14:09,254 --> 00:14:10,889
So,

221
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:12,957
don't forget to like
and subscribe.

222
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,593
Thank you, guys, for following.

223
00:14:14,627 --> 00:14:16,928
I love you. Bye.

224
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:24,402
Seriously, you got to read it.

225
00:14:24,436 --> 00:14:27,972
<i>Consider the Lobster</i> is
one of the fucking greats, man.

226
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:30,442
Cracked my head open
like a, uh...

227
00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:32,344
like a lobster claw.

228
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:40,218
You know, I'm actually
writing a novel.

229
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:41,252
Well, kind of,

230
00:14:41,286 --> 00:14:43,621
'cause I'm such a fucking
perfectionist, you know?

231
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:45,256
It's just taking me forever.

232
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,926
I just keep going over it
and over it and over it

233
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,495
in my head,
just picking at it like a scab.

234
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:52,330
It's about, uh, I guess, like,

235
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:54,666
what it's like to be a guy
right now, you know?

236
00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:57,102
Like, what it's like to be
a guy in the world.

237
00:14:57,135 --> 00:15:00,205
Just this gritty,
low-life, fucked-up love story.

238
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:02,173
And it all takes place
in New York

239
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:04,442
over the course of one night.

240
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:06,644
You know what?

241
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:08,580
I'm gonna stop talking about it.

242
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:10,582
I don't want to jinx it.

243
00:15:10,615 --> 00:15:12,150
You do coke, right?

244
00:15:12,183 --> 00:15:14,652
- Mm, not really.
- Oh, come on.

245
00:15:14,686 --> 00:15:17,622
I got work in the morning.

246
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:19,657
Oh, whatever. So do I.

247
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,395
Here.

248
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:25,096
Get right.

249
00:15:26,097 --> 00:15:26,765
No.

250
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:29,900
Just put your nose up to this.

251
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:32,470
No, here. Maybe just...

252
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:36,307
Okay, that didn't work.

253
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:43,415
Hey. Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

254
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:45,383
There you go.

255
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:55,427
Oh, my God,
you are so, so pretty.

256
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,695
But why are you wearing
all that makeup?

257
00:15:57,729 --> 00:15:59,264
Do you mind me asking?

258
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:01,633
I never understood why women
wear so much makeup.

259
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,269
It's like, you guys are so much
more beautiful without it.

260
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:07,037
It's like, guys don't even like
that kind of stuff, you know?

261
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,039
It's just this
soul-sucking system

262
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:11,543
meant to oppress women,
and it's fucked up.

263
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:18,383
I want to see you.

264
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,051
The real you.

265
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:25,222
With all your freckles
and your imperfections.

266
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:32,597
I don't feel good.

267
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,666
Could you get me
a glass of water?

268
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:37,100
Yeah. Sure.

269
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:51,381
Are you fucking kidding me?

270
00:16:52,382 --> 00:16:54,619
Hey.

271
00:16:54,652 --> 00:16:56,386
Hey, you.

272
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,023
Hey!

273
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:01,492
Hey.

274
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:02,727
There you are.

275
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,261
You fell asleep.

276
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:13,337
Good girl.

277
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:16,607
Feel better?

278
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,109
No.

279
00:17:19,142 --> 00:17:20,644
You know, I, um...

280
00:17:20,677 --> 00:17:23,113
I nearly didn't
come out tonight.

281
00:17:23,146 --> 00:17:24,782
And I am so glad that I did.

282
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:27,084
I feel such a connection
to you.

283
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,119
Could you call me a cab?

284
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:31,321
You just got here.

285
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:33,524
- No, I need to go home.
- No.

286
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:35,459
Don't go.

287
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:37,261
Stay.

288
00:17:37,294 --> 00:17:39,396
My God, you are so...

289
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,064
I need to go.

290
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:43,100
No, you don't want to go home.

291
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,369
I need to go home.

292
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:01,485
- Hey, Neil.
- Yeah?

293
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:06,156
I said I need to go home.

294
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:08,158
Holy shit. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

295
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:09,326
What is this?

296
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,861
Are you some kind
of psycho or something?

297
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:12,329
Why do you say that?

298
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:14,164
- I just thought that you were...
- Drunk?

299
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:15,599
- Yeah.
- Really drunk?

300
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:16,700
Fuck.

301
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:17,801
Yeah.

302
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:19,236
Well, I'm not.

303
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:21,138
But that's good, isn't it?

304
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:23,340
- I think you should leave.
- Oh.

305
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:25,576
- Now you want me to leave?
- No.

306
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:28,312
I just... I'm really high.

307
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:30,314
Like, I'm really fucking high
right now.

308
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:31,848
I don't know what I'm doing.

309
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:34,284
I think you should go.

310
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:37,254
But a second ago, you were
determined for me to stay.

311
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,289
You were pretty insistent,
actually.

312
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,491
I'm a nice guy.

313
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,393
Are you?

314
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:45,829
I thought we had
a connection, I guess.

315
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:47,331
A connection?

316
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:49,165
Okay.

317
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:52,101
What do I do for a living?

318
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:54,771
Sorry.
Maybe that one's too hard.

319
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:56,540
How old am I?

320
00:18:57,774 --> 00:19:00,510
How long have I lived
in the city?

321
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:04,213
What are my hobbies?

322
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,685
What's my name?

323
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:12,389
All right.

324
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:15,291
All right, fuck,
I get your fucking point.

325
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:16,827
What do you want from me?

326
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,695
To say that I'm an asshole?

327
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:20,631
Fine, I'm a fucking asshole.

328
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:22,866
Whoa.

329
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,901
Why are you so freaked out,
Neil?

330
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:26,369
You really need to calm down.

331
00:19:26,402 --> 00:19:28,572
At least you didn't try
to have sex with me

332
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:29,806
while I was passed out.

333
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,340
You do get points for that.

334
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:33,810
A few guys, meh...
eh, they don't mind so much.

335
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:38,514
But you woke me up before
putting your fingers inside me.

336
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:40,651
- That was sweet.
- What are you trying to say?

337
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:43,252
That I'm, like,
a predator or something?

338
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:45,521
I don't know. Are you?

339
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:47,556
I am a nice guy.

340
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:49,191
You keep saying that.

341
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:50,861
You're not as rare as you think.

342
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:52,763
You know how I know?

343
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:54,330
No.

344
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:57,734
Because every week,
I go to a club,

345
00:19:57,768 --> 00:20:02,873
and every week, I act like
I'm too drunk to stand.

346
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:05,976
And every...

347
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:10,279
...fucking week,
a nice guy like you

348
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:13,416
comes over to see if I'm okay.

349
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:19,555
You want to fuck me still?

350
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:21,724
No, thank you, ma'am.

351
00:20:21,757 --> 00:20:23,827
Hmm.

352
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,728
No one ever does.

353
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:29,699
Careful next time
you go out, Neil.

354
00:20:29,732 --> 00:20:32,601
Your novel sounds terrible,
by the way.

355
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:50,786
Night, Nina.

356
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:02,531
What's this?

357
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:08,270
Mom, what's this?

358
00:21:08,971 --> 00:21:10,706
What do you mean?

359
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,576
This gift.

360
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:17,546
It's your birthday, Cassie.

361
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:21,784
Oh.

362
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:25,354
Yeah.

363
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:28,424
What kind of...

364
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:30,459
kind of person
forgets their 30th birthday?

365
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:33,028
Oh, sweetheart, come on.
Don't...

366
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:35,598
Don't, Stanley.
You know, please, don't.

367
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:37,500
It was just a mistake, Mom.

368
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:39,068
You know I'm terrible
with dates.

369
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:40,836
It's not a big deal.

370
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,471
Not a big deal?

371
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:44,573
Not a big deal?

372
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:48,377
You-you just forgot
your birthday.

373
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,346
You don't want to have a party?

374
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:52,348
You don't want to see
your friends?

375
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:54,083
You know I don't have
any friends, Mom.

376
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:56,919
Don't joke about it. Don't.

377
00:21:56,952 --> 00:22:00,556
Do you know how strange this is?

378
00:22:01,957 --> 00:22:04,660
You, you're still living
here at home.

379
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:06,796
Working in that
stupid coffee shop

380
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:09,598
since you and Nina
dropped out of med school.

381
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:12,101
You're out all night long
doing God only knows what.

382
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:13,803
- Okay.
- And you...

383
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:15,905
You don't have any boyfriend.
You don't have any friends.

384
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:18,941
Mom, you should have saved
all that for my birthday card.

385
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:21,710
Why don't we just let the kid
celebrate however she wants?

386
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:24,479
- Okay?
- All my friends, they ask about you.

387
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,616
I-I-I don't know
what to tell them.

388
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,985
I-I don't know
what happened here.

389
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:32,822
I don't...

390
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,760
Why don't you just open
your present there, Cass?

391
00:22:37,793 --> 00:22:39,094
Okay?

392
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:40,896
Go ahead.

393
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,932
Yeah.

394
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:56,278
Oh, I hope you like it.

395
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:02,517
Thank you.

396
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,488
<i>Whoa.</i>

397
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:09,158
- Yeah.
- That's direct.

398
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:11,659
A real kick in the cunt.

399
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:14,029
- Is it a nice suitcase, at least?
- Oh, yeah.

400
00:23:14,063 --> 00:23:15,331
It's definitely the fanciest

401
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:18,133
"get the fuck out of our house"
metaphor I've received so far.

402
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:19,068
So, why don't you?

403
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:21,003
- What?
- Get the fuck out of their house.

404
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:24,472
Just, I don't know, go on Zillow or...

405
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:26,608
<i>Single White Female</i> some girl.

406
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:28,877
Get a basement room at some
weird guy's house, anything.

407
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:30,812
I can't afford it, Gail.

408
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:32,413
Not on what you pay me.

409
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,149
Not even a weird guy's basement.

410
00:23:34,183 --> 00:23:36,185
So take this other job, then.

411
00:23:36,218 --> 00:23:37,186
Take any job.

412
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:39,454
Are you firing me?

413
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:41,456
Maybe I should.

414
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:43,791
Look, you're making
the assumption

415
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:45,493
that I want any of it.

416
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:46,661
If I wanted a boyfriend

417
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:48,596
and a yoga class
and a house and kids

418
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,899
and a job my mom could
brag about, I'd have done it.

419
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:54,035
It would take me ten minutes.
I don't want it.

420
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:55,837
I don't want it.

421
00:23:56,704 --> 00:23:58,473
But you must want something.

422
00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:00,708
Hey.

423
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:03,145
Oh. You.

424
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:05,914
- Hi.
- One coffee, hold the spit.

425
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:09,484
She spat in my coffee last time.

426
00:24:10,151 --> 00:24:12,553
I'm back because, um,

427
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:16,090
I think you gave me a...
a fake number the other day.

428
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:18,059
Mm, that doesn't sound like me.

429
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:19,193
I know.

430
00:24:19,228 --> 00:24:21,230
So I spent a few hours composing

431
00:24:21,263 --> 00:24:23,798
a, like, very witty,
very romantic text,

432
00:24:23,831 --> 00:24:28,069
and then I sent that text to
an oil rig worker called Red.

433
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:30,204
- Was he into it?
- Surprisingly into it.

434
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:33,541
It was, like,
immediately inappropriate.

435
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:36,077
But it's not gonna work out
'cause of the oil rig,

436
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,081
so I thought I'd try you again.

437
00:24:40,114 --> 00:24:42,216
I just heard a phone ring
in the back.

438
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,619
- No, you didn't.
- I most definitely heard

439
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:46,521
a phone ring in the back.

440
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:49,958
She has to take a few
imaginary calls a day.

441
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,697
Um, look, if you're not
into this, totally get it.

442
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,733
I'm not really looking to date
anyone at the moment.

443
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:00,735
Right. Yeah.

444
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:01,936
Me, neither.

445
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,840
Would you... be interested
in a friendship

446
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:10,111
and I'm secretly pining for you
the whole time?

447
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:13,247
Dating's horrible.
Everyone's horrible.

448
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:15,583
Okay, I went on a date
last month with a woman

449
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:16,851
who wanted to euthanize
the homeless.

450
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:18,586
You went on a date with my mom?

451
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:19,721
Look,

452
00:25:19,754 --> 00:25:22,256
I always liked you
at med school.

453
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,624
Okay?

454
00:25:23,658 --> 00:25:25,727
I genuinely like you,

455
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,162
and I can't stop thinking about
you spitting in my coffee.

456
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:31,032
So go to lunch with me
this weekend.

457
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:33,901
Please. If you don't like it,
we can have a safe word

458
00:25:33,935 --> 00:25:37,005
and you can leave,
no questions asked.

459
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:38,773
<i>Not that you mind the killings.</i>

460
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:40,607
Your book is full of killings.

461
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:44,746
But there are things
you do hate, Lord.

462
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:47,015
Perfume-smelling things.

463
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:48,682
Lacy things.

464
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,151
Things with curly hair.

465
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:54,554
Hey.

466
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:55,890
You're all dressed up.

467
00:25:55,923 --> 00:25:57,624
Where you going?

468
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:59,760
I'm going out for lunch.

469
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:01,896
With who?

470
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:03,630
A friend.

471
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,799
Cassie.

472
00:26:07,368 --> 00:26:09,803
You look very pretty, honey.

473
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:13,107
Thank you, Dad.

474
00:26:14,242 --> 00:26:16,710
<i>Where... where did she get</i>

475
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:17,979
- a skeleton's hand from?
- She got it...

476
00:26:18,012 --> 00:26:19,813
It was her, uh...
it was her grandfather's.

477
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:21,848
No. It was... She got it
from the staff room,

478
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:25,186
but the worst part is
she looked me in the eye,

479
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:28,256
pulled it out
and then waved it at me.

480
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,625
And I am done.

481
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:33,794
And I'm wondering why
I told that story.

482
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:36,797
Hey. There is nothing more
romantic than a disturbed woman

483
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,599
pulling a skeleton's hand
out of her vagina.

484
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:40,801
That's true.
That's very true.

485
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:43,670
No one ever pulls anything
out of anywhere where I work.

486
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,072
Right, so you didn't want to...

487
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:47,175
- What?
- Carry on with med school or...

488
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,608
No.

489
00:26:48,642 --> 00:26:50,211
Really? Why not?

490
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:52,746
I wanted to do something else.

491
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:53,980
Why?

492
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:54,981
I don't know.

493
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:57,318
You were so good, though.
You knew everything.

494
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:59,320
- You...
- I didn't know everything.

495
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:01,688
You did.
You were incredible.

496
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:04,091
I was... I was awful. I...

497
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,860
Remember I removed the
wrong kidney from my cadaver?

498
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:09,162
And look at you now...
operating on children.

499
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:10,864
Yes. I got better.

500
00:27:10,897 --> 00:27:14,368
Thank God. But you, you were
way ahead of everybody.

501
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:17,003
You-you would have been
a great doctor.

502
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:21,375
Just didn't want it enough,
I guess.

503
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:25,979
Um...

504
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,747
You want to get coffee
or something?

505
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:29,983
We, um... we have some time
before the movie.

506
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:32,352
I can tell you about the guy
who got his dick

507
00:27:32,386 --> 00:27:33,720
trapped in a tambourine.

508
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:35,322
Oh, my God.

509
00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:40,694
Do you think people think
you're my daughter from behind?

510
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:41,995
'Cause of the height.

511
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,763
- The height, I'm saying.
- No.

512
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:45,799
It's like a fear
I have in public,

513
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:47,400
if I'm with a woman.

514
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:49,836
My fear is that, like,
if I kiss her,

515
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,873
like, people will be like,
"Stop kissing that child."

516
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:55,742
- I shouldn't yell this part, but...
- No.

517
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:58,678
I mean, try not being
so tall, maybe.

518
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:00,680
- Don't be tall.
- Maybe, yeah.

519
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:02,249
- Yeah.
- It's kind of flashy.

520
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,154
Whoa. This is...
this is a weird coincidence.

521
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:08,388
What?

522
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:10,123
I think...

523
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:11,224
No.

524
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:12,759
Yeah, this is my apartment.

525
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,897
What a weird, weird coincidence.

526
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,032
Yeah. Do you want to...

527
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:20,433
I mean, we're here.

528
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:23,170
Do you want to go up,
have a drink or...

529
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:25,305
Sure. Why not?

530
00:28:25,338 --> 00:28:27,741
Too soon. Sorry. I wasn't...

531
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:29,075
No, let's go upstairs.

532
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:32,045
I don't want to go up
if you don't want to...

533
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:33,780
I-I misread things.
I'll-I'll drive you home.

534
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,248
You know what?
You're at your place.

535
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:36,316
I can call a cab.

536
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:37,750
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

537
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,452
Okay, I feel like
I fucked this up.

538
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:41,955
No, it's not you.

539
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:15,522
Pediatric
assistant to admitting.

540
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:19,025
Need a pediatric assistant
to admitting, please.

541
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:22,229
- I'll let you know.
- Okay. Thank you.

542
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:25,098
Cassie, what...

543
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:27,267
What are you...
what are you doing here?

544
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,970
Um...

545
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:35,242
I just came to pick up
my herpes medication.

546
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:36,809
You have herpes, too.

547
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:39,145
That saves us
an awkward conversation.

548
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,550
Dr. Dinkins, please dial 3751.

549
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:47,119
Dr. Dinkins, 3751.

550
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,921
So, I...

551
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:52,124
So, I'd like to see you again.

552
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,926
Oh.

553
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,061
- If that's cool.
- Yeah.

554
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,498
But we'd need to take it slow.
I understand...

555
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:01,867
Of course. Totally. I...

556
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,403
I can take it slow.

557
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:06,872
I can barely move,
if you'd like.

558
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:09,409
Thank you.

559
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:10,809
Yeah. Sorry.

560
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:11,944
I could write a poem.

561
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,178
This is awesome.

562
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:16,148
Uh, what are you doing? You want
to get dinner or something?

563
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,550
Are you working?

564
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:19,018
Well, no. Um...

565
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,854
He has leukemia, and, uh,

566
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:23,989
there's really nothing
I can do for him.

567
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:27,993
- Oh, my God.
- It's-it's over.

568
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:29,562
- I'm kidding. My shift's over.
- Oh, my God.

569
00:30:29,596 --> 00:30:31,330
- I'll grab my stuff, okay?
- Okay.

570
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:32,431
Okay.

571
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:34,900
Don't leave.

572
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,811
- Oh, my God.
- What?

573
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,882
Are you seeing that guy?

574
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,951
No.

575
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,856
Aw.

576
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,892
Good for you.

577
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,632
<i>So, Ryan...</i>

578
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:08,300
pediatric surgeon, huh?

579
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:10,235
Yes. Yes.

580
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,339
You ever killed any children?

581
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,940
Uh, what?

582
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,075
While operating on them.

583
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:17,943
Have you ever killed
any children?

584
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,478
Uh, no. No.

585
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:20,546
Really?

586
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:21,613
- Gail.
- I...

587
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:25,551
Well, kids have passed
while I've been operating.

588
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,252
So that's a yes. Yes...

589
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:30,489
Gail, stop asking him
if he's killed children.

590
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:33,992
I will stop asking him
when he stops killing children.

591
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:37,229
That-that seems fair.

592
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,465
That seems fair.

593
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:41,433
I'll leave you two
lovebirds to it.

594
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:44,937
- Can you lock up for me, honey?
- Of course.

595
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:50,976
Now, if you two decide
to have sex on the counter,

596
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,878
the bleach is in the back room.

597
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,216
And I don't want to walk
in here tomorrow morning

598
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,218
and see ass prints
in the coffee grinds.

599
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,519
Got it?

600
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,121
Got it, lover boy?

601
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,056
Yeah.

602
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,923
Have fun, you two.
Oh, my God.

603
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,567
She seems nice.

604
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:19,271
She is. She's a good friend.

605
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:22,541
Are you... are you friends with
anyone from Forrest still or...

606
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,008
No.

607
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:26,311
Really? No one? No one?

608
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:27,945
Really, no one.

609
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,281
Oh, my God, I can't...
I can't...

610
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,350
I can't shake them off.

611
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,287
You still hang out
with those guys?

612
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,389
They're not that bad.
They aren't, really.

613
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:38,956
Um, oh, my God.

614
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,126
Madison McPhee just had twins.

615
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,163
She's completely obsessed.

616
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:47,299
I don't remember Madison.

617
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:50,669
You...
I thought you were close.

618
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,705
You guys and that other girl.

619
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:55,407
No.

620
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:57,074
Huh.

621
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,210
Um, oh, my God.

622
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,581
Al Monroe is marrying
this bikini model.

623
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,751
He got this hideous tattoo
of her name to propose.

624
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:08,319
Amazingly, she said yes.

625
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,456
Classic Al, you know?

626
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,323
Landing on his feet.

627
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:14,058
Al Monroe?

628
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:17,061
You... well,
you must remember Al.

629
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:18,996
Yeah, I thought
he moved to London.

630
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,364
Yeah, he was there for years,

631
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,535
but he just moved back
to get married.

632
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:25,269
You see him a lot?

633
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:28,740
Uh, we're not close,
but he's in the group.

634
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:30,609
We actually
see each other at work,

635
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:33,478
'cause he's a...
anesthesiologist.

636
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,413
Good for him.

637
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,081
And he's getting married?

638
00:33:37,114 --> 00:33:40,151
I know. God help her.

639
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,791
Welcome to
the Hotel Saint Joan, miss.

640
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:28,292
Thank you.

641
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:31,862
One ginger ale
and one bottle of champagne.

642
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,498
- Don't worry. I can do that.
- Oh, but it's...

643
00:35:56,252 --> 00:35:58,388
Cassie.

644
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,257
Madison.

645
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:03,461
Oh, my God.

646
00:36:06,262 --> 00:36:07,765
Oh, you look amazing.

647
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,734
I almost didn't recognize you.

648
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:12,770
You look exactly the same.

649
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,805
- You're sweet. I look so old.
- No.

650
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,607
That's what having twins
will do to you.

651
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,675
It's tragic.

652
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:18,776
Do you have kids?

653
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,310
No.

654
00:36:20,343 --> 00:36:22,278
You'll get there.

655
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:26,216
Champagne?
What are we drinking to?

656
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:28,551
To old friends.

657
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:37,160
Mm.

658
00:36:38,361 --> 00:36:39,930
Mm.

659
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,799
Ah.

660
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:45,635
Honestly, I thought I'd be
bored out of my skull

661
00:36:45,669 --> 00:36:48,706
watching the kids,
but it's been great, actually.

662
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,809
Are we out already?
Can we get another bottle?

663
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,309
Thanks.

664
00:36:53,343 --> 00:36:55,813
I haven't been day drunk
in forever.

665
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,848
- So fun.
- So fun.

666
00:37:01,317 --> 00:37:05,555
TBH, I know all guys say
they want wives that work,

667
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:07,858
but it's not true.

668
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,459
- No?
- No.

669
00:37:09,492 --> 00:37:12,295
I mean, they all want
a feminist in college,

670
00:37:12,328 --> 00:37:13,630
because it's cool
to have a girlfriend

671
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:14,999
who cares about something.

672
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,466
And, statistically,

673
00:37:16,499 --> 00:37:18,435
feminists are more likely
to do anal.

674
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:19,970
That's a literal fact,
by the way.

675
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,304
Really?

676
00:37:21,337 --> 00:37:22,405
You know, when it
comes down to it,

677
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:23,974
all guys want the same thing.

678
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,809
And what's that?

679
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:28,012
A good girl.

680
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,546
I don't seem to remember

681
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:32,615
you were that much
of a good girl in med school.

682
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:33,850
Well, Fred... Thanks.

683
00:37:33,883 --> 00:37:35,485
Fred didn't know me at school.

684
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:37,987
He met me when I was
working at L'Oréal.

685
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,589
Poor Fred.

686
00:37:39,622 --> 00:37:43,860
What he doesn't know
won't kill him, right?

687
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:45,729
I'm glad everything
has worked out

688
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:46,963
so well for you, Madison.

689
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:47,964
Thanks.

690
00:37:47,997 --> 00:37:49,532
- It really has.
- Yeah.

691
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:53,570
You know, I actually
wanted to meet you today

692
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:55,972
to talk about something
in particular.

693
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:57,507
I did wonder.

694
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,542
No one's heard from you
in, like, forever.

695
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,480
I wanted to talk to you
about why I dropped out.

696
00:38:05,982 --> 00:38:07,350
Okay, sure.

697
00:38:07,383 --> 00:38:09,753
You remember
what happened, right?

698
00:38:11,921 --> 00:38:14,491
Um, s-such a long time ago now.

699
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:16,726
I know, but you remember.

700
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:20,396
I mean, vaguely.

701
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,766
Do you ever think about it?

702
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:26,002
Why would I?

703
00:38:26,035 --> 00:38:28,471
Right. Why would you?

704
00:38:30,406 --> 00:38:32,475
So, if a friend came to you now,

705
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:37,346
into your house, and told you
that they thought something bad

706
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,915
had happened to them
the night before...

707
00:38:38,948 --> 00:38:41,050
- Cassie...
- Something bad.

708
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:43,052
- It was years ago.
- What would you say?

709
00:38:43,086 --> 00:38:44,921
It w...

710
00:38:44,954 --> 00:38:48,357
- What would you say?
- Ugh. I'm so...

711
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:50,593
I feel a little weird.

712
00:38:50,627 --> 00:38:52,996
Would you roll your eyes
behind her back

713
00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:54,664
and dismiss the whole thing
as drama?

714
00:38:54,697 --> 00:38:56,800
I don't know
why you're mad at me.

715
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:59,502
Okay, I-I'm not the only one
who didn't believe it.

716
00:38:59,536 --> 00:39:01,805
If-if you have a reputation
for sleeping around,

717
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:03,773
then maybe people
aren't gonna believe you

718
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:05,842
when you say
something's happened.

719
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:08,111
I mean...

720
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:10,847
it's crying wolf.

721
00:39:12,514 --> 00:39:14,383
You thought it was crying wolf?

722
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:16,451
I don't make the rules.

723
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:19,421
Look, when you get that drunk,
things happen.

724
00:39:19,454 --> 00:39:22,125
Don't get blackout drunk
all the time

725
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:24,426
and then expect people
to be on your side

726
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:26,696
when you have sex
with someone you don't want to.

727
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:28,865
I mean...

728
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:32,836
That's a shame.

729
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:35,571
I was hoping you'd feel
differently by now.

730
00:39:35,604 --> 00:39:37,040
- Sorry.
- For your sake,

731
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:39,441
I was hoping you'd feel
different by now.

732
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:46,115
Look... look, don't be mad.

733
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:47,984
Just, I'll get the check,
all right?

734
00:39:48,017 --> 00:39:49,953
It's my treat.

735
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:51,687
Hello?

736
00:39:53,022 --> 00:39:54,858
Are you okay, Madison?

737
00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:58,161
My head is spinning.
I just feel...

738
00:39:58,194 --> 00:40:00,129
Oh! Shit.

739
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:01,865
My God.

740
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:03,632
Sorry.

741
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:09,438
It really is so great
seeing you again.

742
00:40:09,471 --> 00:40:12,441
You really haven't
changed at all.

743
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:14,978
That's great.

744
00:40:18,947 --> 00:40:20,916
So?

745
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:24,686
She's over there.

746
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,023
Room 25.

747
00:40:27,056 --> 00:40:29,758
Your money's in the envelope.

748
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:31,894
You sure about this?

749
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:33,896
I'm sure.

750
00:40:54,483 --> 00:40:55,918
Cassie, hi.

751
00:40:55,951 --> 00:40:58,787
Um, wonderful to see you
for lunch yesterday.

752
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,789
Blast from the past.

753
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:02,157
Uh, hey.

754
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,059
I was pretty drunk.

755
00:41:04,092 --> 00:41:05,961
I can't really, um...

756
00:41:05,994 --> 00:41:09,932
Look, did you see me talking
to a guy, like, our age?

757
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:11,633
He seemed to know you.

758
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:14,102
Just trying to piece
some things together.

759
00:41:15,671 --> 00:41:17,940
Cassie, sorry.
Please call me back.

760
00:41:17,973 --> 00:41:19,608
I-I'm freaking out a little.

761
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:21,810
I woke up in
one of the hotel rooms.

762
00:41:21,843 --> 00:41:23,545
I-I think something
might have happened.

763
00:41:23,578 --> 00:41:25,480
I-I don't know.

764
00:41:48,971 --> 00:41:50,539
Your place, right?

765
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,778
- See you tomorrow, bitches.
- Bye, Amber.

766
00:41:56,812 --> 00:41:58,714
- Excuse me.
- Bye.

767
00:41:58,747 --> 00:42:01,116
Excuse me! Hi.

768
00:42:01,149 --> 00:42:02,584
- Me?
- Yeah.

769
00:42:02,617 --> 00:42:04,052
Hi. Sorry.

770
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:05,187
What's up?

771
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,989
I'm so sorry,
but my-my phone has died,

772
00:42:07,022 --> 00:42:08,256
and I'm so late for work.

773
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,292
Do you live around here?
Do you know the area?

774
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:11,860
I guess. Why?

775
00:42:11,893 --> 00:42:14,262
Would you tell me how to get
to the Castle Diner?

776
00:42:14,296 --> 00:42:16,597
You know what?
I'm actually, like, really late.

777
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,266
Please. I'm supposed to be
shooting this music video,

778
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,667
- and I...
- Music video?

779
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:21,136
Uh, yeah, I'm-I'm
a makeup artist, and it's

780
00:42:21,169 --> 00:42:23,772
my first time working with
these guys, and if I'm late,

781
00:42:23,805 --> 00:42:25,874
- I may as well not...
- Oh, my God.

782
00:42:25,907 --> 00:42:26,875
Oh, my God.

783
00:42:26,908 --> 00:42:28,243
Are you working for Wet Dreams?

784
00:42:28,276 --> 00:42:29,677
You didn't see that.

785
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,678
I know where
the Castle Diner is.

786
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:31,579
Don't worry about it.

787
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:32,513
- I'll ask someone else.
- No way. No way.

788
00:42:32,546 --> 00:42:35,150
Oh, my God, you're working
with Wet Dreams!

789
00:42:35,183 --> 00:42:37,252
Oh, my God!
Are they there right now?

790
00:42:37,285 --> 00:42:39,287
You need to calm down, please.

791
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:40,755
I can direct you. Please.

792
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:42,656
Sorry. No.

793
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:46,028
If I don't direct you,
how are you gonna find it?

794
00:42:46,061 --> 00:42:47,295
I can't.

795
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:49,764
If you tell anyone
or you post about this,

796
00:42:49,797 --> 00:42:51,665
I will never work again.

797
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,201
I swear I won't post anything.

798
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:54,336
I promise.

799
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:56,704
Take my phone.
Seriously, take it.

800
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:59,174
Ugh! God, okay.

801
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:00,275
Get in. Fine.

802
00:43:00,308 --> 00:43:02,244
But you have to be
cool about this.

803
00:43:02,277 --> 00:43:04,179
No. Of course I will.

804
00:43:06,914 --> 00:43:08,050
Whoa.

805
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:09,717
You really are a fan.

806
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,819
I'm obsessed.
I have a whole Insta

807
00:43:11,852 --> 00:43:13,155
dedicated just to George's dog.

808
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:15,323
What a crazy coincidence.

809
00:43:15,357 --> 00:43:16,657
I know.

810
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,592
You know what?

811
00:43:18,626 --> 00:43:20,594
This... this is fate.

812
00:43:20,628 --> 00:43:24,099
Sure seems like it, huh?

813
00:43:36,644 --> 00:43:38,646
Yes?

814
00:43:40,848 --> 00:43:44,051
Dean Walker is ready,
if you'd like to go on through.

815
00:43:53,694 --> 00:43:55,830
Daisy.

816
00:43:55,863 --> 00:43:57,865
- That's me.
- Dean Walker.

817
00:43:57,898 --> 00:43:59,133
Please sit.

818
00:44:00,734 --> 00:44:03,305
My assistant says that
you are interested

819
00:44:03,338 --> 00:44:05,272
in resuming med school.

820
00:44:05,306 --> 00:44:06,674
That's right.

821
00:44:06,707 --> 00:44:08,410
May I ask what prompted
your desire

822
00:44:08,443 --> 00:44:10,177
to get back to your studies?

823
00:44:10,211 --> 00:44:12,380
I guess...

824
00:44:12,414 --> 00:44:14,949
I couldn't stop thinking
about my time here.

825
00:44:14,982 --> 00:44:17,118
Yeah.
It's an extraordinary place.

826
00:44:18,152 --> 00:44:19,987
It's an unusual request.

827
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,390
Yes, but I left under
unusual circumstances.

828
00:44:23,425 --> 00:44:24,825
Oh.

829
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:27,261
I left because of
what happened to Nina.

830
00:44:27,294 --> 00:44:28,362
Hmm.

831
00:44:28,395 --> 00:44:30,331
Nina Fisher.

832
00:44:30,364 --> 00:44:31,966
You don't remember her?

833
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:36,203
Maybe you remember
Alexander Monroe?

834
00:44:36,237 --> 00:44:37,938
Oh, yes. Alexander Monroe.

835
00:44:37,972 --> 00:44:41,008
He actually just came back
and gave a talk here.

836
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,744
Oh, he's a...
he's a really nice guy.

837
00:44:43,777 --> 00:44:44,879
Really smart.

838
00:44:44,912 --> 00:44:46,714
- Are you a friend of his?
- No.

839
00:44:46,747 --> 00:44:47,948
So, you don't remember

840
00:44:47,982 --> 00:44:49,950
the accusations made
against Al Monroe?

841
00:44:49,984 --> 00:44:51,452
I don't.

842
00:44:51,485 --> 00:44:54,822
He took a girl, Nina Fisher,

843
00:44:54,855 --> 00:44:58,826
the one you don't remember,
back to his room,

844
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:01,162
where he had sex with her
repeatedly

845
00:45:01,195 --> 00:45:02,429
and in front of his friends

846
00:45:02,463 --> 00:45:06,033
while she was too drunk to have
any idea what was going on.

847
00:45:06,066 --> 00:45:08,402
She was covered in bruises
the next day.

848
00:45:08,435 --> 00:45:11,405
Handprints,
I guess you could say.

849
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:13,374
Was it reported?

850
00:45:13,407 --> 00:45:14,808
Yes.

851
00:45:14,842 --> 00:45:16,844
Do you know who Nina spoke to?

852
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:19,079
You.

853
00:45:21,282 --> 00:45:23,450
But you can't remember, so...

854
00:45:23,484 --> 00:45:25,718
You felt there wasn't
sufficient evidence.

855
00:45:25,752 --> 00:45:27,021
You said it was too much

856
00:45:27,054 --> 00:45:30,124
of a "he said, she said"
situation.

857
00:45:30,157 --> 00:45:31,258
Well...

858
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:35,795
you know, we get accusations
like this all the time.

859
00:45:35,828 --> 00:45:37,198
One or two a week.

860
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:39,866
I'm sorry I don't remember
your friend Nina,

861
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,468
but I can assure you,
at that time,

862
00:45:41,502 --> 00:45:43,204
that I looked into it
thoroughly.

863
00:45:43,237 --> 00:45:47,308
His friends were all
watching, laughing.

864
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:48,808
It's so hard.

865
00:45:48,841 --> 00:45:50,777
But, you know, also,
if she was drinking

866
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,846
and-and maybe couldn't
remember everything...

867
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,949
So, she shouldn't
have been drunk?

868
00:45:55,983 --> 00:45:58,385
- I'm not saying that. I...
- I'm sorry, I don't...

869
00:45:58,419 --> 00:46:00,454
I don't mean
to sound critical, Dean Walker.

870
00:46:00,487 --> 00:46:02,855
I just want to be clear.

871
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:05,092
None of us want to admit

872
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,993
when we've made ourselves
vulnerable.

873
00:46:07,026 --> 00:46:08,962
When we've made a bad choice.

874
00:46:08,995 --> 00:46:11,098
And those choices,
those mistakes,

875
00:46:11,131 --> 00:46:15,102
can be so damaging
and really regrettable.

876
00:46:17,538 --> 00:46:19,506
- Regrettable?
- Yes.

877
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,508
I mean, because
what would you have me do?

878
00:46:21,542 --> 00:46:23,410
Ruin a young man's life

879
00:46:23,444 --> 00:46:26,079
every time we get
an accusation like this?

880
00:46:26,112 --> 00:46:28,948
So you're happy to take
the boy's word for it?

881
00:46:28,982 --> 00:46:31,117
I have to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

882
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:31,951
Of course you do.

883
00:46:31,985 --> 00:46:34,787
Because innocent
until proven guilty.

884
00:46:34,821 --> 00:46:37,291
No arguing with that.

885
00:46:37,324 --> 00:46:39,393
No.

886
00:46:39,426 --> 00:46:41,295
Thank you for your time.

887
00:46:42,296 --> 00:46:44,331
- Is your friend okay?
- No.

888
00:46:44,365 --> 00:46:45,865
She's not.

889
00:46:45,898 --> 00:46:47,568
But Al Monroe is.

890
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:49,869
You'll be glad to hear
he's doing really well.

891
00:46:49,902 --> 00:46:52,939
- He's getting married, actually, so...
- Hmm.

892
00:46:52,972 --> 00:46:54,341
You know, I guess you did
the right thing.

893
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:58,177
We have to give these boys
the benefit of the doubt.

894
00:46:58,211 --> 00:47:00,146
That's why I know
you won't mind that,

895
00:47:00,179 --> 00:47:03,116
three hours ago, I picked your
daughter Amber up from school

896
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:05,985
and introduced her to the boys
who live in that room now.

897
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:08,288
- What?
- She is really pretty, huh?

898
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:10,356
She looks
a lot older than she is.

899
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:12,593
- I don't believe you.
- I noticed they had a few

900
00:47:12,626 --> 00:47:14,327
bottles of vodka
in their room, too.

901
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,030
But I'm sure they'll take
good care of your daughter.

902
00:47:17,063 --> 00:47:18,599
She seemed excited, actually.

903
00:47:28,441 --> 00:47:29,543
Oh, wait.

904
00:47:29,576 --> 00:47:31,444
I have her phone.

905
00:47:31,477 --> 00:47:33,880
She'll be wanting that later.

906
00:47:35,548 --> 00:47:37,383
You're crazy.

907
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:39,052
No.

908
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:41,988
Tell me what room
my daughter is in right now.

909
00:47:42,021 --> 00:47:44,857
I told you...
the same room Nina was in.

910
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:47,327
I told you
I don't remember that.

911
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,961
Well, that's a shame.

912
00:47:49,663 --> 00:47:51,864
What are you doing?

913
00:47:51,898 --> 00:47:53,399
She is a young girl.

914
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:57,170
I wonder if she looks so young
to those guys.

915
00:47:57,203 --> 00:47:59,572
You better tell me
what room she's in.

916
00:47:59,605 --> 00:48:02,875
Tell me what fucking room
she's in!

917
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:05,078
Now, you sociopath!

918
00:48:05,111 --> 00:48:07,513
Tell me where she is!

919
00:48:07,547 --> 00:48:09,349
Right now!

920
00:48:09,382 --> 00:48:11,984
Tell me what room she's in!

921
00:48:13,152 --> 00:48:14,854
Please!

922
00:48:16,556 --> 00:48:19,025
Please tell me.

923
00:48:28,668 --> 00:48:31,371
You're right, okay?

924
00:48:31,404 --> 00:48:33,973
Is that what you want to hear?

925
00:48:34,006 --> 00:48:36,075
You're right.

926
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:40,113
You're right.

927
00:48:44,016 --> 00:48:46,552
Look how easy it was.

928
00:48:46,586 --> 00:48:50,022
I guess you just had to think
about it in the right way.

929
00:48:51,157 --> 00:48:52,658
I guess it feels different

930
00:48:52,692 --> 00:48:55,061
when it's someone you love.

931
00:48:57,296 --> 00:49:00,266
Tell me where
my daughter is, please.

932
00:49:10,576 --> 00:49:12,043
Relax.

933
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:13,546
Dean Walker,
do you really think

934
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:15,147
I would do something like that?

935
00:49:15,181 --> 00:49:18,049
Luckily, I don't have as much
faith in boys as you do.

936
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:20,185
Amber is sitting in a diner,

937
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:22,622
waiting for her favorite
boy band to show up

938
00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:24,424
for a music video.

939
00:49:24,457 --> 00:49:27,293
It's the Castle Diner,
if you want to call and check.

940
00:49:27,326 --> 00:49:29,362
Or you should probably call,
actually,

941
00:49:29,395 --> 00:49:32,063
or she may never figure out
they're not coming.

942
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:34,199
She's kind of an idiot, huh?

943
00:49:35,334 --> 00:49:36,436
Gorgeous, though.

944
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:38,136
Who needs brains?

945
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,706
They never did a girl any good.

946
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,241
Great to see you again,
Dean Walker.

947
00:49:56,388 --> 00:49:58,724
Hey! You're blocking the road!

948
00:49:58,758 --> 00:50:02,194
Get out of the fucking road!

949
00:50:02,227 --> 00:50:04,329
What the fuck is wrong with you?

950
00:50:04,362 --> 00:50:07,065
Hey. Hey!

951
00:50:07,098 --> 00:50:09,201
You're sitting in the middle
of the intersection.

952
00:50:09,234 --> 00:50:11,002
How'd you get your license?

953
00:50:11,036 --> 00:50:13,338
You blow the entire DMV?

954
00:50:13,371 --> 00:50:14,774
Hello.

955
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:16,475
I'm talking to you.

956
00:50:16,508 --> 00:50:18,343
Look at me, you stupid cunt.

957
00:50:19,712 --> 00:50:22,147
Huh?

958
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,548
You want to have a face...
Okay, yeah.

959
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:24,750
Come on over. Let's do this.

960
00:50:24,784 --> 00:50:25,918
Where are you going?

961
00:50:25,952 --> 00:50:28,587
You're just gonna leave
your car in the intersection?

962
00:50:28,621 --> 00:50:30,388
You coming over here? Huh?

963
00:50:30,422 --> 00:50:32,357
Are you angry?

964
00:50:36,394 --> 00:50:37,730
Holy shit!

965
00:50:37,763 --> 00:50:39,799
Is that a fucking tire iron?

966
00:50:39,832 --> 00:50:42,167
You psycho!

967
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,769
Just chill out, okay?

968
00:50:43,803 --> 00:50:46,371
Why don't you calm down.

969
00:50:46,404 --> 00:50:47,639
Oh! Okay.

970
00:50:47,672 --> 00:50:49,541
Whoa! Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

971
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:53,211
Crazy fucking bitch.

972
00:50:54,546 --> 00:50:56,816
Excuse me?

973
00:50:56,849 --> 00:50:58,783
Fuck you.

974
00:51:28,847 --> 00:51:31,182
Fuck.

975
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,662
Ryan, what are...?

976
00:51:43,695 --> 00:51:44,796
She lives.

977
00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:46,831
I'm just kidding. You weren't
answering your phone,

978
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:49,134
- so I was...
- Oh, shit. The movie.

979
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:51,503
Oh, I-I'm so sorry.
I had to work late.

980
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:54,205
Yeah, I-I went by
the coffee shop.

981
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,808
Gail said you took the day off.

982
00:51:56,841 --> 00:51:58,643
- Um...
- Everything all right?

983
00:51:58,677 --> 00:52:00,178
Yeah.

984
00:52:00,211 --> 00:52:02,213
No, I'm fine. I'm just in
the middle of something.

985
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:05,115
Totally. Got it.
We can make the movie still

986
00:52:05,149 --> 00:52:06,183
if we skip dinner.

987
00:52:06,217 --> 00:52:08,286
Um, I'm a little tired.

988
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,788
- Yeah.
- Um, do you mind if I call you tomorrow?

989
00:52:09,821 --> 00:52:10,855
Sure. Great.

990
00:52:10,889 --> 00:52:13,190
- Okay.
- Are you okay, though?

991
00:52:13,223 --> 00:52:15,527
You seem kind of...

992
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,462
What?

993
00:52:17,495 --> 00:52:20,765
Uh... off.

994
00:52:20,799 --> 00:52:23,602
No, um, I'm fine.
I'm just...

995
00:52:23,635 --> 00:52:25,403
Too-too much... too much coffee.

996
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:27,339
Don't work in a coffee shop.

997
00:52:27,372 --> 00:52:28,807
Okay.

998
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,508
All right, night.

999
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:32,477
All right, good night.

1000
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:03,307
Here we go.

1001
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,577
- Yeah, but you watch your step here.
- Whoop!

1002
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:08,245
Now, when we get to the house,
you got to be quiet,

1003
00:53:08,278 --> 00:53:10,447
'cause I don't know if
my parents are asleep or not.

1004
00:53:10,481 --> 00:53:13,183
- Okay. Mm.
- We got to be respectful.

1005
00:53:13,217 --> 00:53:15,552
This is fucking surge prices.

1006
00:53:15,586 --> 00:53:17,656
1.2? That's...

1007
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:20,424
I mean, it's not that far.

1008
00:53:20,457 --> 00:53:22,259
- You can walk, right?
- I don't know.

1009
00:53:22,292 --> 00:53:23,662
Let's try. Let's go.

1010
00:53:23,695 --> 00:53:24,929
Come on, now.

1011
00:53:24,963 --> 00:53:26,463
Whoop, there we go.

1012
00:53:26,497 --> 00:53:28,800
You got it. That was fun.

1013
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,802
Yeah.

1014
00:53:30,835 --> 00:53:33,805
Cassie?

1015
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:35,406
Ryan.

1016
00:53:35,439 --> 00:53:37,976
What are you doing here?

1017
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:40,344
I'm meeting friends

1018
00:53:40,377 --> 00:53:44,581
'cause my schedule
cleared up last minute.

1019
00:53:44,615 --> 00:53:45,850
Let me explain.

1020
00:53:45,884 --> 00:53:47,284
It's fine. It's...

1021
00:53:47,317 --> 00:53:48,552
Uh, my bad, dude.

1022
00:53:48,585 --> 00:53:50,922
I didn't know
the woman was taken, but...

1023
00:53:50,955 --> 00:53:52,589
- She's...
- She's all yours, man.

1024
00:53:52,623 --> 00:53:54,525
All mine?

1025
00:53:54,558 --> 00:53:56,427
Uh...

1026
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,762
Do you know her name or...?

1027
00:53:58,796 --> 00:54:00,364
Claire?

1028
00:54:00,397 --> 00:54:02,332
- Wow.
- Pretty close.

1029
00:54:02,366 --> 00:54:03,935
Okay. Have a good night.

1030
00:54:03,968 --> 00:54:05,636
Don't go, Ryan. Wait, please.

1031
00:54:05,669 --> 00:54:07,438
Cassie, if you didn't...
if you weren't interested,

1032
00:54:07,471 --> 00:54:09,941
just, you could've just told me.

1033
00:54:11,742 --> 00:54:13,711
That's ice-cold.

1034
00:54:13,744 --> 00:54:15,279
That was humiliating.

1035
00:54:15,312 --> 00:54:17,715
Why don't you just
fuck off now, okay?

1036
00:54:17,748 --> 00:54:20,651
Wait, are you sober?

1037
00:54:20,684 --> 00:54:22,386
Oh, shit.

1038
00:54:22,419 --> 00:54:24,388
You're that psycho
that Jerry took home.

1039
00:54:24,421 --> 00:54:25,756
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1040
00:54:25,789 --> 00:54:27,558
You know what?
Not interested, sweetheart.

1041
00:54:27,591 --> 00:54:29,727
Nah. Why don't you take
your crazy somewhere else.

1042
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,329
You're not even that hot.

1043
00:54:32,362 --> 00:54:35,666
You're hardly dropping
panties yourself, Paul.

1044
00:54:35,699 --> 00:54:39,236
When was the last time
you scored in daylight?

1045
00:54:40,637 --> 00:54:41,839
Careful.

1046
00:54:41,872 --> 00:54:44,575
No, you be careful.

1047
00:54:44,608 --> 00:54:47,377
I'm not the only one
who does this.

1048
00:54:47,411 --> 00:54:50,647
And some of the other girls,
they really are crazy.

1049
00:54:52,783 --> 00:54:54,418
I-I don't believe you.

1050
00:54:54,451 --> 00:54:58,388
There's a woman in this city
that carries a pair of scissors.

1051
00:55:00,424 --> 00:55:02,025
You're-you're lying.

1052
00:55:02,059 --> 00:55:04,628
Hmm. Try it out
next time you go out.

1053
00:55:04,661 --> 00:55:06,730
See what happens.

1054
00:55:08,899 --> 00:55:10,334
Why?

1055
00:55:10,367 --> 00:55:12,870
Why you guys have to ruin
everything?!

1056
00:55:35,092 --> 00:55:36,894
Can I help you?

1057
00:55:36,927 --> 00:55:38,729
I really hope so.

1058
00:55:38,762 --> 00:55:41,665
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm no longer
practicing the law,

1059
00:55:41,698 --> 00:55:43,934
if that's what you've come for.

1060
00:55:43,967 --> 00:55:46,003
It's not about that.

1061
00:55:46,036 --> 00:55:48,872
I'm afraid it's
your day of reckoning.

1062
00:55:50,874 --> 00:55:53,911
I've been waiting.

1063
00:55:53,944 --> 00:55:55,646
Come in.

1064
00:56:00,684 --> 00:56:04,054
<i>Your office told me
you're on sabbatical.</i>

1065
00:56:04,087 --> 00:56:05,823
It was very easy
to get your address.

1066
00:56:05,856 --> 00:56:07,124
They just gave it to me.

1067
00:56:07,157 --> 00:56:09,960
I told them to give it
to anyone who asked.

1068
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:11,594
That doesn't seem safe.

1069
00:56:11,627 --> 00:56:14,330
No use hiding from the piper.

1070
00:56:15,464 --> 00:56:16,900
He has to be paid.

1071
00:56:17,935 --> 00:56:19,036
I guess so.

1072
00:56:19,069 --> 00:56:23,073
You seem nervous, Mr. Green.

1073
00:56:23,106 --> 00:56:25,474
I came here to talk to you
about something

1074
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:27,110
that happened seven years ago.

1075
00:56:27,144 --> 00:56:29,046
You probably
won't remember a client

1076
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:31,148
named Alexander Monroe.

1077
00:56:31,181 --> 00:56:34,550
You helped so many boys
like him.

1078
00:56:34,584 --> 00:56:36,619
And you most certainly
won't remember the girl

1079
00:56:36,652 --> 00:56:39,555
who you threatened and bullied
till she dropped her case.

1080
00:56:41,859 --> 00:56:43,894
I remember her.

1081
00:56:46,096 --> 00:56:47,697
Nina?

1082
00:56:48,764 --> 00:56:49,832
Was that it?

1083
00:56:49,866 --> 00:56:53,603
I'm sorry, I don't remember
her full name, but...

1084
00:56:55,471 --> 00:56:57,840
It was Nina, though, wasn't it?

1085
00:57:00,743 --> 00:57:02,079
Yes.

1086
00:57:02,112 --> 00:57:04,480
I remember her.

1087
00:57:10,053 --> 00:57:12,521
Have you come here to hurt me?

1088
00:57:14,924 --> 00:57:17,526
Do you want me to hurt you?

1089
00:57:18,928 --> 00:57:20,663
I think so.

1090
00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:27,536
I-I had a... what I think
was a-an epiphany,

1091
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:32,742
but my doctors called it
a psychotic episode.

1092
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:37,647
And it was at work, so...

1093
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,917
so now I'm on a sabbatical.

1094
00:57:42,785 --> 00:57:46,989
You know, I got a bonus for
every settlement out of court.

1095
00:57:47,023 --> 00:57:50,092
I got another bonus
for every charge dropped.

1096
00:57:50,126 --> 00:57:51,994
We all did.
There was a guy...

1097
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:57,633
His only job was to comb through
all their social media accounts

1098
00:57:57,667 --> 00:58:00,536
for any compromising
information.

1099
00:58:00,569 --> 00:58:03,606
He contacted old friends,
past sexual partners.

1100
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:05,675
Oh, you'd be amazed
how much easier it is now

1101
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:07,677
with the Internet
to dig up dirt.

1102
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,947
In the old days, we'd have to
go through a girl's trash.

1103
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:13,950
Now one drunk photo at a party.

1104
00:58:13,983 --> 00:58:18,020
Oh, you wouldn't believe
how hostile that makes a jury.

1105
00:58:20,523 --> 00:58:22,458
You got to help me.

1106
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:25,995
I can't sleep.

1107
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:29,598
I can't sleep.

1108
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,802
I haven't slept in...

1109
00:58:36,038 --> 00:58:38,841
I'll never forgive myself.

1110
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:42,645
I want you to know that.

1111
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:49,018
I'll never forgive myself
for any of this.

1112
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:58,593
I forgive you.

1113
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:05,001
I'm so sorry.

1114
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:15,011
Go to sleep.

1115
00:59:32,928 --> 00:59:35,031
Do I go in now?

1116
00:59:37,832 --> 00:59:39,634
- No.
- Oh.

1117
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:42,804
I'm stilling getting paid,
though, right?

1118
00:59:44,073 --> 00:59:45,975
Yeah.

1119
01:00:05,361 --> 01:00:07,629
Cassie?

1120
01:00:13,768 --> 01:00:15,737
Do you remember
Nina's 16th birthday party?

1121
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:19,007
Oh, my gosh.
How could I forget?

1122
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,842
I was such a mess.

1123
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:22,677
Nina threw up on the swing.

1124
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:25,947
Mm-hmm. Certainly not
her finest moment.

1125
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,683
And that boy
who stole your vase.

1126
01:00:28,716 --> 01:00:31,152
And she made him bring it
back to you and apologize.

1127
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:33,822
He was so scared of her.

1128
01:00:33,855 --> 01:00:34,923
She was holding onto his ear.

1129
01:00:34,956 --> 01:00:37,359
"You better say you're sorry
to my mom, you asshole."

1130
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:41,830
What was his name?

1131
01:00:41,863 --> 01:00:45,934
Simon or Steve or something.

1132
01:00:50,138 --> 01:00:52,140
Why are you here?

1133
01:00:55,743 --> 01:00:58,113
I just wanted to see you.

1134
01:00:58,146 --> 01:00:59,848
You need to stop this.

1135
01:00:59,881 --> 01:01:01,417
It isn't good for any of us.

1136
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:03,785
It's no good for Nina.

1137
01:01:03,818 --> 01:01:06,721
It isn't good for you.

1138
01:01:06,754 --> 01:01:09,224
Look, I know you feel bad
that you weren't there,

1139
01:01:09,257 --> 01:01:11,126
but you got to let it go.

1140
01:01:16,264 --> 01:01:18,066
I'm just trying to fix it.

1141
01:01:18,099 --> 01:01:20,869
Oh, come on. You can't.

1142
01:01:20,902 --> 01:01:23,671
Don't be a child, Cassie.

1143
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:29,010
I'm so sorry
I didn't go with her.

1144
01:01:29,043 --> 01:01:31,379
No.

1145
01:01:31,412 --> 01:01:33,348
I'm sorry, too.

1146
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:51,099
Cassie.

1147
01:01:51,132 --> 01:01:52,901
Move on.

1148
01:01:52,934 --> 01:01:54,402
Please.

1149
01:01:54,435 --> 01:01:56,804
For all of us.

1150
01:03:05,373 --> 01:03:08,141
Oh, great, it's you.

1151
01:03:08,176 --> 01:03:10,077
Can I come in?

1152
01:03:13,013 --> 01:03:14,315
Yep.

1153
01:03:15,849 --> 01:03:17,851
Do you want something?
Do you want a coffee?

1154
01:03:17,884 --> 01:03:21,256
Or another dude to go home with?

1155
01:03:21,289 --> 01:03:22,523
Yeah, actually.

1156
01:03:22,557 --> 01:03:24,259
Do you have any douchebags
lying around?

1157
01:03:24,292 --> 01:03:27,828
Yeah. There's
a racist on the eighth floor.

1158
01:03:27,861 --> 01:03:29,963
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

1159
01:03:31,299 --> 01:03:34,768
What do you want, Cassie?

1160
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:38,038
I came to apologize about...

1161
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:39,339
Oh.

1162
01:03:39,374 --> 01:03:42,410
I've been trying to think
about how to explain.

1163
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,183
It's not that
I'm not interested.

1164
01:03:50,217 --> 01:03:53,287
- Mm.
- I really am.

1165
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,122
I really, really am.

1166
01:03:55,155 --> 01:03:56,423
Okay.

1167
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:57,958
Sorry if I'm confused.

1168
01:03:57,991 --> 01:03:59,293
It...
You...

1169
01:03:59,326 --> 01:04:01,295
Sorry, we...
we've been on a couple dates.

1170
01:04:01,328 --> 01:04:06,333
Um, you won't kiss me
or touch me, which is fine.

1171
01:04:06,366 --> 01:04:09,870
And then I see you going home

1172
01:04:09,903 --> 01:04:13,073
with some random creep
in a fedora.

1173
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:18,078
I admit, the fedora
was unforgivable.

1174
01:04:21,515 --> 01:04:24,384
The other night...

1175
01:04:24,418 --> 01:04:28,255
It's hard to explain it,
but it won't happen again.

1176
01:04:28,288 --> 01:04:31,091
I promise,
it'll never happen again.

1177
01:04:32,225 --> 01:04:34,461
Can we try again?

1178
01:04:34,494 --> 01:04:37,397
Can I, I mean.

1179
01:04:38,565 --> 01:04:40,334
I don't...

1180
01:04:40,367 --> 01:04:42,269
I don't know.

1181
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:46,973
Are you okay?

1182
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:51,445
Um...

1183
01:04:52,612 --> 01:04:55,148
It's fine. I'm...

1184
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:58,385
I guess I'll see you around.

1185
01:05:39,192 --> 01:05:41,395
We're closed.

1186
01:05:41,428 --> 01:05:43,397
Good.

1187
01:05:52,439 --> 01:05:56,443
Do you want to go to dinner,
you miserable asshole?

1188
01:06:01,715 --> 01:06:03,316
Yeah.

1189
01:06:31,411 --> 01:06:34,213
Shit.

1190
01:06:36,483 --> 01:06:38,752
First trip to
the pharmacy together.

1191
01:06:38,785 --> 01:06:40,587
Yeah.

1192
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:42,321

- That's weird.
- Literally weeks.

1234
01:08:33,866 --> 01:08:35,501
Thank you.

1235
01:08:35,534 --> 01:08:36,869
Sorry.

1236
01:08:36,902 --> 01:08:38,571
They're okay.

1237
01:08:41,407 --> 01:08:43,242
Cheese?

1238
01:08:43,275 --> 01:08:44,376
Would love it.

1239
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:46,445
Yeah. Thank you.

1240
01:08:48,714 --> 01:08:50,583
- Bread?
- Ah, yep.

1241
01:08:50,616 --> 01:08:52,451
Okay.

1242
01:08:53,686 --> 01:08:56,154
Mm. Oh. Thank you.

1243
01:08:56,187 --> 01:08:57,856
What a home.
It's unbelievable.

1244
01:08:57,890 --> 01:08:59,725
- So beautiful.
- Yeah, it's nice.

1245
01:08:59,758 --> 01:09:00,893
Susan works really hard.

1246
01:09:00,926 --> 01:09:03,127
- Yeah, it shows.
- Yeah.

1247
01:09:03,161 --> 01:09:05,598
Eat, eat, before it gets cold.

1248
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:06,732
This looks delicious.

1249
01:09:06,765 --> 01:09:08,867
- Oh. Oh.
- Thank you.

1250
01:09:08,901 --> 01:09:10,603
I made the sauce.

1251
01:09:10,636 --> 01:09:12,638
The sauce is...

1252
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,341
Mm.

1253
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:18,510
The sauce is really good.

1254
01:09:19,645 --> 01:09:21,447
- Incredible.
- Mm.

1255
01:09:22,648 --> 01:09:25,484
Ryan, I hear you're a doctor.

1256
01:09:25,517 --> 01:09:27,720
Your parents must be
very, very proud.

1257
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,724
Not really.
Uh, they wanted me to be a DJ.

1258
01:09:39,898 --> 01:09:41,432
He's funny.

1259
01:09:41,466 --> 01:09:43,301
Yeah.

1260
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:44,536
That's funny.

1261
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:46,905
You didn't say
he was funny, Cassie.

1262
01:09:46,939 --> 01:09:49,507
- Dad.
- You didn't say I was...

1263
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:52,176
- You didn't say I was funny?
- No.

1264
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:54,178
I said you were boring but rich.

1265
01:09:54,212 --> 01:09:56,314
I am boring. Not that rich.

1266
01:09:56,347 --> 01:09:57,716
No? Well, in that case,

1267
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:58,917
thanks for stopping by, kid.

1268
01:10:00,318 --> 01:10:02,520
What kind of doctoring
do you do?

1269
01:10:02,553 --> 01:10:04,857
Uh, pediatric, so...

1270
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:06,658
children.

1271
01:10:06,692 --> 01:10:08,226
What was your, uh...

1272
01:10:08,259 --> 01:10:10,729
What was that doctor's name?
Cassie's doctor.

1273
01:10:10,763 --> 01:10:13,197
- Gary?
- Um, no.

1274
01:10:13,231 --> 01:10:15,333
Dr. Katzen-something.

1275
01:10:15,366 --> 01:10:17,568
Yeah. Dad, he was like 80.

1276
01:10:17,602 --> 01:10:18,904
Yeah, well...

1277
01:10:18,937 --> 01:10:20,773
You-you don't know
Dr. Katzen...?

1278
01:10:20,806 --> 01:10:21,907
No.

1279
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:23,408
Now, I'm-I'm confused.

1280
01:10:23,441 --> 01:10:27,545
Are there different parts
of the body on a child?

1281
01:10:27,578 --> 01:10:29,848
No, it's pretty much
the same thing.

1282
01:10:29,882 --> 01:10:30,983
You're just...

1283
01:10:31,016 --> 01:10:33,251
You know, different-colored
Band-Aids and things.

1284
01:10:33,284 --> 01:10:36,254
It's not brain surgery.

1285
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,655
Well...

1286
01:10:37,689 --> 01:10:40,358
I get it. Yeah.

1287
01:10:40,391 --> 01:10:41,826
Oh.

1288
01:10:41,859 --> 01:10:44,295
This sauce is
absolutely unbelievable.

1289
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:47,699
Night, you two.

1290
01:10:47,732 --> 01:10:49,400
Night.

1291
01:10:53,905 --> 01:10:56,641
Thanks for
introducing us to Ryan.

1292
01:10:59,044 --> 01:11:00,812
I know it was hard.

1293
01:11:02,047 --> 01:11:04,482
You know, your mom, she's...

1294
01:11:04,515 --> 01:11:10,354
Well, I mean,
we're both so glad that, uh...

1295
01:11:11,022 --> 01:11:12,490
Oh, my God, Dad.

1296
01:11:12,523 --> 01:11:13,991
He's not that nice.

1297
01:11:14,025 --> 01:11:16,260
Yeah.

1298
01:11:16,294 --> 01:11:19,297
Yeah, I must be tired.

1299
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:21,499
Okay.

1300
01:11:24,035 --> 01:11:28,740
Honey, Nina was like
a daughter to us.

1301
01:11:28,773 --> 01:11:30,341
You know that.

1302
01:11:30,374 --> 01:11:32,577
We really miss her.

1303
01:11:33,978 --> 01:11:36,848
But, God, we have missed you.

1304
01:11:41,052 --> 01:11:43,020
See you tomorrow.

1305
01:11:53,064 --> 01:11:55,800
<i>Your mom...
oh, your mom is hot.</i>

1306
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:57,034
Sorry.

1307
01:11:57,068 --> 01:12:00,071
Your mom is extremely hot.

1308
01:12:00,104 --> 01:12:02,339
Do you want her number?

1309
01:12:03,074 --> 01:12:04,976
- I could hook you up.
- Really?

1310
01:12:05,009 --> 01:12:06,376
Ooh.

1311
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:08,311
I think she likes you
more than I do.

1312
01:12:08,345 --> 01:12:10,548
Well, I hope that's not true.

1313
01:12:12,917 --> 01:12:15,285
Can I... Mm.

1314
01:12:16,087 --> 01:12:18,055
Can I tell you something?

1315
01:12:18,089 --> 01:12:19,857
Sure.

1316
01:12:22,392 --> 01:12:24,394
I think you're amazing. I...

1317
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:26,531
- Oh, no, Ryan.
- Just shut up, you stupid bitch.

1318
01:12:26,564 --> 01:12:27,932
- Please don't.
- Shh. I...

1319
01:12:27,965 --> 01:12:29,867
- Just take this, please.
- Mm-hmm.

1320
01:12:29,901 --> 01:12:32,036
I think you're incredible. I...

1321
01:12:32,069 --> 01:12:34,639
I'm...

1322
01:12:34,672 --> 01:12:38,408
I'm-I'm... I think
I'm falling in love with you.

1323
01:12:42,713 --> 01:12:45,716
I think I'm falling
in love with you, too.

1324
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:46,416
Yes.

1325
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:47,919
- Oh, my God.
- Don't make...

1326
01:12:47,952 --> 01:12:49,519
- Oh, my.
- Don't make a thing of it.

1327
01:12:49,553 --> 01:12:51,421
- I'm gonna buy you a bicycle.
- No.

1328
01:12:51,454 --> 01:12:53,691
- I want to buy you a bicycle.
- Ryan, be cool.

1329
01:12:53,724 --> 01:12:55,392
I'm cool.

1330
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:58,129
I'm so cool.

1331
01:12:58,162 --> 01:13:00,530
Oh, I'm the coolest.

1332
01:13:06,603 --> 01:13:07,839
Cassie.

1333
01:13:07,872 --> 01:13:10,107
Shit.

1334
01:13:10,141 --> 01:13:12,375
Madison,
what are you doing here?

1335
01:13:12,409 --> 01:13:13,911
Sorry. I, um...

1336
01:13:13,945 --> 01:13:15,512
I tried calling.

1337
01:13:15,545 --> 01:13:18,049
I left messages
about, uh, that guy.

1338
01:13:18,082 --> 01:13:19,716
Your friend.

1339
01:13:19,749 --> 01:13:22,619
Um, I don't know if-if your
phone number wasn't working.

1340
01:13:22,652 --> 01:13:24,654
Maybe I had an old one.
I just... I mean...

1341
01:13:24,688 --> 01:13:27,524
I know it seems kind of crazy,
me waiting on your porch

1342
01:13:27,557 --> 01:13:29,559
like some kind of stalker
or something.

1343
01:13:29,593 --> 01:13:31,494
Madison, I'm sorry.
I should've called you back.

1344
01:13:31,528 --> 01:13:34,865
Nothing happened with that guy.
Please believe me.

1345
01:13:34,898 --> 01:13:37,634
Are you sure? I...
But it seemed like...

1346
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:40,171
I know what it seemed like,
but it wasn't.

1347
01:13:40,204 --> 01:13:41,838
He didn't touch you.

1348
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,475
Oh, thank God.

1349
01:13:45,508 --> 01:13:47,944
Oh.

1350
01:13:49,613 --> 01:13:52,515
Oh, I was...
I was so worried that, um...

1351
01:13:52,549 --> 01:13:54,118
that I... that he and I, um...

1352
01:13:54,151 --> 01:13:55,919
He just put you in bed.

1353
01:13:55,952 --> 01:13:58,688
Kept an eye on you
to make sure you were okay.

1354
01:13:58,722 --> 01:14:01,024
I'm really sorry
I didn't call you back.

1355
01:14:01,057 --> 01:14:02,993
It wasn't nice.

1356
01:14:03,026 --> 01:14:04,494
Yeah, well...

1357
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:06,763
God. Look, there...

1358
01:14:08,165 --> 01:14:09,933
I need to show you something.

1359
01:14:09,966 --> 01:14:12,102
Okay.

1360
01:14:12,136 --> 01:14:14,404
Can we go inside?

1361
01:14:16,006 --> 01:14:17,974
Yeah.

1362
01:14:24,814 --> 01:14:27,717
Do you want a glass of water
or something?

1363
01:14:27,751 --> 01:14:29,619
No, thank you.

1364
01:14:43,066 --> 01:14:44,234
Oh.

1365
01:14:44,267 --> 01:14:48,571
After we had lunch and...

1366
01:14:48,605 --> 01:14:52,609
I got so drunk and woke up
in a hotel room with that guy,

1367
01:14:52,642 --> 01:14:55,979
um, I thought about it.

1368
01:14:56,012 --> 01:14:58,214
About what you said about Nina.

1369
01:14:58,248 --> 01:15:01,551
And how we all
just acted like...

1370
01:15:06,723 --> 01:15:09,893
And I remembered something.

1371
01:15:09,926 --> 01:15:11,594
What?

1372
01:15:15,131 --> 01:15:16,533
What?

1373
01:15:18,068 --> 01:15:19,936
There was a tape.

1374
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:26,109
- What?
- A stupid video.

1375
01:15:26,142 --> 01:15:28,211
It just got sent around.

1376
01:15:28,244 --> 01:15:29,846
I got sent it.

1377
01:15:29,879 --> 01:15:31,815
Everyone did.
At the time, it was...

1378
01:15:32,682 --> 01:15:34,818
It was just gossip, you know?

1379
01:15:34,851 --> 01:15:36,618
Gossip?

1380
01:15:38,154 --> 01:15:42,759
So much stuff happened
back then, like, all the time.

1381
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:44,260
You know what it was like.

1382
01:15:44,294 --> 01:15:46,196
It was just one blackout
after the next.

1383
01:15:46,229 --> 01:15:49,099
I-I hoped I'd imagined it.

1384
01:15:49,132 --> 01:15:50,934
But, um...

1385
01:15:53,937 --> 01:15:56,840
I always saved all my phones
for photos or whatever.

1386
01:15:56,873 --> 01:15:59,042
So, um...

1387
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:02,846
Here.

1388
01:16:02,879 --> 01:16:06,548
I don't know how we all could
have watched it and, um...

1389
01:16:08,918 --> 01:16:10,519
What?

1390
01:16:11,187 --> 01:16:13,589
Thought it was funny.

1391
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,229
You can have the phone, okay?

1392
01:16:19,262 --> 01:16:22,698
You don't have to watch it.
I really wouldn't watch it.

1393
01:16:22,731 --> 01:16:25,035
But, um, I don't know,
do whatever you want with it.

1394
01:16:25,068 --> 01:16:27,803
Just leave me out of it.

1395
01:16:27,836 --> 01:16:29,671
And...

1396
01:16:29,705 --> 01:16:32,008
please, will you do me a favor?

1397
01:16:33,942 --> 01:16:35,111
Yeah.

1398
01:16:37,213 --> 01:16:40,549
Never fucking contact me again.

1399
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:37,373
Al, get it!

1400
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,374
Come on, stop.

1401
01:17:38,408 --> 01:17:39,908
Go on. Come on, come on.

1402
01:17:39,942 --> 01:17:41,910
Shh, shh, shh.
Calm down, calm down.

1403
01:17:41,944 --> 01:17:44,246
Oh, my God.

1404
01:17:44,279 --> 01:17:45,681
Whoa. This is insane.

1405
01:17:45,714 --> 01:17:46,982
Ryan, holy shit.
Come look at this.

1406
01:17:47,015 --> 01:17:48,717
Man, you got to check this out.

1407
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:50,385
Yo, don't film me.
Dude, put the camera away.

1408
01:17:50,419 --> 01:17:52,888
What are you fucking doing?
Oh, my God.

1409
01:17:52,921 --> 01:17:55,190
Ryan, come on.

1410
01:17:55,224 --> 01:17:56,859
This is fucked up.

1411
01:17:59,294 --> 01:18:01,130
Jesus Christ.

1412
01:18:01,163 --> 01:18:02,698
Al, Al.

1413
01:19:09,031 --> 01:19:12,201
Cassie, what...
what are you doing here?

1414
01:19:12,234 --> 01:19:13,502
Are-are you okay or...

1415
01:19:13,535 --> 01:19:15,470
Can we go somewhere
to talk privately?

1416
01:19:15,504 --> 01:19:17,805
I'm working.

1417
01:19:17,838 --> 01:19:20,475
We need to talk right now.

1418
01:19:20,509 --> 01:19:23,278
Okay.
What's... what's going on?

1419
01:19:23,312 --> 01:19:26,281
- Everything all right or...?
- I've been such an asshole.

1420
01:19:26,315 --> 01:19:28,050
What happened?

1421
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:31,153
I really thought for a second
it was all gonna be okay.

1422
01:19:31,186 --> 01:19:32,987
Cassie.

1423
01:19:35,856 --> 01:19:36,958
Look at this.

1424
01:19:38,527 --> 01:19:40,761
What are you showing me?
What is this?

1425
01:19:41,463 --> 01:19:42,997
- Is that Al Monroe?
- Mm.

1426
01:19:44,865 --> 01:19:45,967
Oh, my God, it...

1427
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:46,968
Shh, shh, shh.

1428
01:19:47,001 --> 01:19:48,135
Wait, is that... I don't...

1429
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:49,837
I don't want to look
at that, Cassie.

1430
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:50,972
Well, why not?

1431
01:19:51,005 --> 01:19:52,241
You were happy to watch
back then.

1432
01:19:52,274 --> 01:19:54,041
What are you talking about?
I wasn't...

1433
01:19:54,075 --> 01:19:56,110
Oh, my God. Whoa.

1434
01:19:56,143 --> 01:19:58,112
- This is insane.
- Ryan, holy shit.

1435
01:19:58,145 --> 01:19:59,780
Come look at this.
Man, you got to check this out.

1436
01:19:59,814 --> 01:20:01,516
Oh, shit.

1437
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:04,353
I don't... I don't remember.
Uh, I don't.

1438
01:20:05,387 --> 01:20:07,221
Didn't make an impact, huh?

1439
01:20:07,255 --> 01:20:09,324
I was a kid. I...

1440
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:14,962
I need you to do
something for me,

1441
01:20:14,996 --> 01:20:18,799
and I want you to think
about it very carefully.

1442
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:22,169
I have this video

1443
01:20:22,203 --> 01:20:24,539
ready to send to everyone
in your address book.

1444
01:20:24,573 --> 01:20:26,340
Your parents.

1445
01:20:26,374 --> 01:20:27,509
Your colleagues.

1446
01:20:27,542 --> 01:20:28,809
All your old buddies
and their wives.

1447
01:20:28,843 --> 01:20:30,344
Cassie, come on.

1448
01:20:33,582 --> 01:20:36,284
So, I can send it out right now,

1449
01:20:36,317 --> 01:20:39,787
or you can tell me where
Al Monroe's bachelor party is.

1450
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:43,291
What?

1451
01:20:43,324 --> 01:20:44,526
Why?

1452
01:20:44,559 --> 01:20:46,027
You don't need to know why.

1453
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:47,529
But what are you gonna do?

1454
01:20:47,562 --> 01:20:49,063
Well, that depends.

1455
01:20:49,096 --> 01:20:50,164
On what?

1456
01:20:50,197 --> 01:20:51,566
You think
they'll fire you here?

1457
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,334
- Oh, geez.
- Dr. Ryan Cooper?

1458
01:20:53,367 --> 01:20:54,368
Oh, fuck.

1459
01:20:54,402 --> 01:20:55,469
I mean,
you work with kids, right?

1460
01:20:55,503 --> 01:20:57,905
They have to be careful.
Things have changed so much

1461
01:20:57,938 --> 01:20:59,173
since we were at school,
haven't they?

1462
01:20:59,206 --> 01:21:00,408
Think about this, please.
Please.

1463
01:21:00,441 --> 01:21:05,279
I cannot begin to tell you
how much I've thought about it.

1464
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:15,323
- Okay.
- Okay.

1465
01:21:23,197 --> 01:21:25,199
All right. There. Okay?

1466
01:21:25,232 --> 01:21:27,301
They're gonna be there
this weekend... all of them.

1467
01:21:27,335 --> 01:21:30,304
You don't... you don't think
I'm a bad person.

1468
01:21:30,338 --> 01:21:32,206
Cassie, I-I...

1469
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:34,208
I love you.

1470
01:21:34,241 --> 01:21:37,144
I love you, Cassie.

1471
01:21:37,178 --> 01:21:41,349
You got to forgive me.
You got to forgive me.

1472
01:21:41,382 --> 01:21:44,452
Tell me you'll forgive me.

1473
01:21:44,485 --> 01:21:46,320
No.

1474
01:21:49,457 --> 01:21:51,225
So, you're perfect, right?

1475
01:21:51,258 --> 01:21:53,227
You've never done anything
you're ashamed of?

1476
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:54,962
You're...

1477
01:21:56,263 --> 01:21:58,599
I can't...

1478
01:21:58,632 --> 01:22:00,900
Are you gonna tell everybody?

1479
01:22:02,002 --> 01:22:03,404
I don't know.

1480
01:22:03,437 --> 01:22:04,605
I don't know if I can live with

1481
01:22:04,638 --> 01:22:06,140
the threat of this
hanging over me.

1482
01:22:07,074 --> 01:22:09,510
I didn't even do anything.

1483
01:22:09,543 --> 01:22:11,112
Okay.

1484
01:22:11,145 --> 01:22:14,348
Poor Ryan,
just an innocent bystander.

1485
01:22:15,383 --> 01:22:17,284
Yeah.

1486
01:22:17,318 --> 01:22:20,254
Don't tell any of them
that I'm coming,

1487
01:22:20,287 --> 01:22:23,090
'cause I'll send the video
around just the same if you do.

1488
01:22:23,124 --> 01:22:24,692
And then we both
won't be doctors,

1489
01:22:24,725 --> 01:22:26,327
you fucking failure.

1490
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:27,561
Nice.

1491
01:22:27,595 --> 01:22:29,896
Bye, Ryan.

1492
01:24:23,376 --> 01:24:25,778
- Oh, shit.
- Holy shit. What?

1493
01:24:25,813 --> 01:24:27,780
Well, the doctor's here.

1494
01:24:38,825 --> 01:24:41,227
Stripper time, baby! Let's go!

1495
01:24:41,261 --> 01:24:44,130
- Let's go!
- Nurse, I'm feeling sick!

1496
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:45,665
Please take my temperature.

1497
01:24:45,698 --> 01:24:47,534
I told you guys no strippers.

1498
01:24:47,567 --> 01:24:49,135
Anastasia's gonna lose her shit.

1499
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,272
All right, who ordered her?

1500
01:24:52,305 --> 01:24:53,806
- Joe?
- Don't look at me.

1501
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,276
No one's owning up?

1502
01:24:56,309 --> 01:24:58,111
All right, well, when Anastasia
finds out, it's your fucking

1503
01:24:58,144 --> 01:24:59,479
- funeral, you hear me?
- Get out of here.

1504
01:24:59,512 --> 01:25:01,447
I take it you're the groom?

1505
01:25:01,481 --> 01:25:03,149
Yeah.

1506
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:06,386
Then sit the fuck down.

1507
01:25:06,419 --> 01:25:07,820
Oh, shit!

1508
01:25:07,854 --> 01:25:09,689
Now.

1509
01:25:09,722 --> 01:25:12,825
I'm gonna need you all
to kneel down in front of me

1510
01:25:12,859 --> 01:25:15,128
like the naughty boys you are.

1511
01:25:15,161 --> 01:25:16,829
- Oh...
- Come on, come on.

1512
01:25:18,598 --> 01:25:20,700
Everybody here?

1513
01:25:20,733 --> 01:25:22,468
I don't want anyone to miss out.

1514
01:25:22,502 --> 01:25:25,438
Oh, yeah. All the patients
are accounted for, Nurse.

1515
01:26:13,519 --> 01:26:14,921
Time to go upstairs.

1516
01:26:14,954 --> 01:26:18,858
No, it's okay.
I don't, uh, w-want to.

1517
01:26:18,891 --> 01:26:20,627
Look, I don't
have to do anything

1518
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:21,894
if you don't want me to,

1519
01:26:21,928 --> 01:26:25,263
but I only get paid
if I go upstairs with you.

1520
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:29,167
Okay.

1521
01:26:29,201 --> 01:26:31,536
Okay, you guys.

1522
01:26:33,305 --> 01:26:35,908
I better see her crawling
out of here in the morning!

1523
01:26:35,942 --> 01:26:37,877
She better not be able to walk!

1524
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:39,912
Leave some for us, man!

1525
01:26:43,683 --> 01:26:45,685
Uh, so what do I, uh...

1526
01:26:45,718 --> 01:26:47,619
Get on the bed.

1527
01:26:47,653 --> 01:26:48,855
Okay.

1528
01:26:48,888 --> 01:26:50,322
I'm a little scared of you.

1529
01:26:50,355 --> 01:26:52,759
You don't need to be scared.
Get on the bed.

1530
01:26:52,792 --> 01:26:55,928
All right.

1531
01:26:55,962 --> 01:26:57,797
Oh! Uh, no, no, no. Sorry.

1532
01:26:57,830 --> 01:26:58,865
I-I'm not sure about that.

1533
01:26:58,898 --> 01:27:01,600
It's for my safety.
When I give private dances,

1534
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:03,735
guys can get
a little handsy, so...

1535
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:05,637
Oh, right. Yeah, of course.

1536
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:11,543
You know, you don't...
you don't need to...

1537
01:27:11,576 --> 01:27:12,812
I'm a gentleman.

1538
01:27:12,845 --> 01:27:14,613
- Are you?
- Yeah.

1539
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:17,582
You might be surprised
to hear that gentlemen

1540
01:27:17,616 --> 01:27:18,951
are sometimes the worst.

1541
01:27:18,985 --> 01:27:20,552
Ow. Oh.

1542
01:27:20,585 --> 01:27:22,754
Sorry, can you, uh...
can you loosen these a little?

1543
01:27:22,788 --> 01:27:25,691
- You'll get used to it.
- Ooh.

1544
01:27:27,559 --> 01:27:29,761
Look, I-I don't want to sound
like a pussy,

1545
01:27:29,795 --> 01:27:33,598
but y-you're not... you're not
gonna do anything, are you?

1546
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:36,835
It's just... I love my fiancée,

1547
01:27:36,868 --> 01:27:38,403
- and we're getting married.
- Aw.

1548
01:27:38,437 --> 01:27:40,405
So I-I don't want any, uh...

1549
01:27:40,439 --> 01:27:42,841
Hey, do I look like someone
who would make you

1550
01:27:42,874 --> 01:27:44,976
do something
you don't want to do?

1551
01:27:45,011 --> 01:27:47,679
- No.
- Exactly.

1552
01:27:49,481 --> 01:27:51,616
Ay.

1553
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:53,618
So, what's your name?

1554
01:27:53,652 --> 01:27:54,653
Candy.

1555
01:27:55,887 --> 01:27:58,590
- I mean your real name.
- Nina.

1556
01:27:58,623 --> 01:28:00,225
Nina Fisher.

1557
01:28:01,993 --> 01:28:03,962
What did you say?

1558
01:28:03,995 --> 01:28:06,231
I said my name is Nina Fisher.

1559
01:28:07,065 --> 01:28:08,934
Can you let me go, please?

1560
01:28:08,967 --> 01:28:10,302
I'm sorry, I can't.

1561
01:28:10,335 --> 01:28:11,803
Did one of the guys
put you up to this?

1562
01:28:11,837 --> 01:28:13,338
Was it Joe?

1563
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:15,807
Jesus Christ, that was dark,
even for him.

1564
01:28:15,841 --> 01:28:16,975
I don't follow.

1565
01:28:17,008 --> 01:28:19,010
- You're not Nina Fisher.
- Why not?

1566
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:22,013
Because she's dead, okay?

1567
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,482
Must be another Nina Fisher.

1568
01:28:23,515 --> 01:28:24,449
- A coincidence.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

1569
01:28:24,483 --> 01:28:26,351
Hey, can you let me
out of these, please?

1570
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:27,285
This isn't funny.

1571
01:28:27,319 --> 01:28:29,321
Why would I give you
a dead girl's name?

1572
01:28:29,354 --> 01:28:32,357
Hey, this is fucked up, okay?
Stop.

1573
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:34,826
But I'm not doing anything.

1574
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:36,293
Guys! Hey, Joe?

1575
01:28:36,328 --> 01:28:37,496
Br-Brandon, Chip.
Hey, guys.

1576
01:28:37,529 --> 01:28:39,765
Can you get up here, please?

1577
01:28:41,466 --> 01:28:43,435
I don't think they can hear you.

1578
01:28:43,468 --> 01:28:46,905
And even if they could,
they're all passed out by now.

1579
01:28:46,938 --> 01:28:50,341
'Cause if there is one thing
I learned at Forrest,

1580
01:28:50,374 --> 01:28:54,411
it's how easy it is
to slip something into a drink.

1581
01:28:54,446 --> 01:28:56,882
You'd think they'd
remember that, especially Joe.

1582
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:00,652
Do I know you?

1583
01:29:00,685 --> 01:29:02,788
I'm not sure
you would remember me, Al.

1584
01:29:02,821 --> 01:29:05,490
You were so popular.

1585
01:29:10,028 --> 01:29:12,063
You're Nina's friend.

1586
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:13,430
Fuck!

1587
01:29:13,464 --> 01:29:14,833
You're Nina's friend.

1588
01:29:14,866 --> 01:29:17,002
So you did notice me after all.

1589
01:29:17,035 --> 01:29:18,536
I'm surprised.

1590
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:20,504
I wasn't super fuckable
back then,

1591
01:29:20,538 --> 01:29:22,406
so I thought I kind of
slipped your attention.

1592
01:29:22,439 --> 01:29:23,942
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh...
What do you want?

1593
01:29:23,975 --> 01:29:25,610
Money?
You blackmailing me?

1594
01:29:25,644 --> 01:29:29,313
I want you to tell me
what you did.

1595
01:29:30,548 --> 01:29:33,417
Are y...
are you talking about...

1596
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:34,953
What do you think
I'm talking about?

1597
01:29:34,986 --> 01:29:36,087
I didn't do anything!

1598
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,689
W-We were kids.

1599
01:29:37,722 --> 01:29:39,925
Oh, if I hear that
one more time.

1600
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:41,425
Look...

1601
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:42,861
Maybe she regretted it after,
okay?

1602
01:29:42,894 --> 01:29:45,596
- Oh, yeah, she regretted it.
- I didn't do anything!

1603
01:29:45,629 --> 01:29:46,832
- Wrong!
- What the fuck...

1604
01:29:46,865 --> 01:29:48,499
Look, I...

1605
01:29:48,532 --> 01:29:50,734
I don't know what
you want me to say, okay,

1606
01:29:50,769 --> 01:29:52,670
b-b-but we-we did not...

1607
01:29:55,739 --> 01:29:56,942
What?

1608
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:58,776
You know.

1609
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:01,445
No.

1610
01:30:01,478 --> 01:30:03,114
She could barely
hold her head up.

1611
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:04,950
She had no idea
what was going on.

1612
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,151
It was a fucking party.

1613
01:30:06,184 --> 01:30:08,053
I-I mean, yeah, look,
we were all drunk,

1614
01:30:08,086 --> 01:30:09,854
of course,
but-but-but she was into it.

1615
01:30:09,888 --> 01:30:13,357
Didn't look like she was
into it on the video.

1616
01:30:14,692 --> 01:30:15,961
What video?

1617
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:17,795
Oh, you don't remember?

1618
01:30:17,828 --> 01:30:19,663
Your friend Joe taped it.

1619
01:30:19,697 --> 01:30:22,433
Let me tell you, that party
does not look so good

1620
01:30:22,466 --> 01:30:24,468
in the cold light of day.

1621
01:30:25,502 --> 01:30:29,007
Look, I'll-I'll give you
anything, okay?

1622
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,808
I mean, I'll-I'll do anything.

1623
01:30:30,841 --> 01:30:32,010
Anything.

1624
01:30:32,043 --> 01:30:33,844
Aw. Don't cry.

1625
01:30:33,878 --> 01:30:35,613
Really, don't fucking cry.

1626
01:30:35,646 --> 01:30:37,581
Tell me what you did.

1627
01:30:37,615 --> 01:30:39,016
I didn't do anything wrong,
though!

1628
01:30:39,050 --> 01:30:41,018
She dropped out.

1629
01:30:41,051 --> 01:30:43,888
Top of her class,
and she dropped out.

1630
01:30:43,921 --> 01:30:45,756
I did, too, to take care of her.

1631
01:30:45,789 --> 01:30:47,691
The two of us gone.

1632
01:30:47,725 --> 01:30:49,927
You graduated
magna cum laude, though.

1633
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,629
Did you ever feel guilty,

1634
01:30:51,662 --> 01:30:53,497
or did you just feel relieved
that she'd gone?

1635
01:30:53,530 --> 01:30:55,032
You know, I was affected
by it, too, okay?

1636
01:30:55,065 --> 01:30:56,467
I mean, it's every guy's
worst nightmare,

1637
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,568
getting accused like that.

1638
01:30:57,601 --> 01:31:01,538
Can you guess what every woman's
worst nightmare is?

1639
01:31:03,941 --> 01:31:06,977
The thing is you thought
you'd gotten away with it

1640
01:31:07,011 --> 01:31:08,646
because everyone had forgotten.

1641
01:31:08,679 --> 01:31:11,148
- Fuck.
- But I haven't.

1642
01:31:11,181 --> 01:31:14,652
You're out of your fucking mind!

1643
01:31:14,685 --> 01:31:17,221
I was so sad to leave, you know?

1644
01:31:17,254 --> 01:31:20,491
I wanted to be a doctor
my whole life.

1645
01:31:20,524 --> 01:31:23,193
But lately,
I've been feeling like...

1646
01:31:23,227 --> 01:31:25,429
I might want to get
back into it.

1647
01:31:26,096 --> 01:31:27,631
Stop.

1648
01:31:27,665 --> 01:31:29,867
- You know...
- Please. Please stop. Hey.

1649
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,201
Nina was extraordinary.

1650
01:31:31,235 --> 01:31:32,670
So smart.

1651
01:31:32,703 --> 01:31:34,204
Help!

1652
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:35,539
Weirdly smart.

1653
01:31:35,572 --> 01:31:37,741
Help! Help me!

1654
01:31:37,775 --> 01:31:38,676
Fuck!

1655
01:31:38,709 --> 01:31:40,811
Help me!

1656
01:31:40,844 --> 01:31:43,013
I want you to know
what she was like, okay?

1657
01:31:43,047 --> 01:31:44,214
Come on.

1658
01:31:44,248 --> 01:31:45,683
She's just so difficult
to explain,

1659
01:31:45,716 --> 01:31:47,251
'cause she was just
so completely herself.

1660
01:31:47,284 --> 01:31:50,453
Even when she was
four years old.

1661
01:31:51,855 --> 01:31:55,259
She was fully formed
from day one.

1662
01:31:55,292 --> 01:31:59,129
Same face. Same walk.

1663
01:31:59,163 --> 01:32:01,098
And funny.

1664
01:32:01,131 --> 01:32:02,498
Like a grown-up is funny.

1665
01:32:02,532 --> 01:32:04,868
Kind of shrewd.

1666
01:32:05,736 --> 01:32:07,805
I was just in awe of her.

1667
01:32:07,838 --> 01:32:10,274
I couldn't believe
she wanted to be my friend.

1668
01:32:10,307 --> 01:32:13,277
She didn't give a fuck
what anyone else thought,

1669
01:32:13,310 --> 01:32:17,147
apart from me,
'cause she was just...

1670
01:32:17,181 --> 01:32:19,582
Nina.

1671
01:32:22,052 --> 01:32:24,587
And then she wasn't.

1672
01:32:25,756 --> 01:32:28,292
Suddenly,
she was something else.

1673
01:32:28,325 --> 01:32:29,960
She was yours.

1674
01:32:31,195 --> 01:32:34,564
It wasn't her name she heard
when she was walking around.

1675
01:32:34,597 --> 01:32:36,566
It was yours.

1676
01:32:36,599 --> 01:32:40,270
Your name all around her.

1677
01:32:40,304 --> 01:32:43,240
All over her all the time.

1678
01:32:43,273 --> 01:32:45,641
And it just...

1679
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:49,880
...squeezed her out.

1680
01:32:52,682 --> 01:32:55,319
So, when I heard
your name again...

1681
01:32:55,352 --> 01:32:59,622
your filthy fucking name...

1682
01:32:59,655 --> 01:33:04,328
I wondered, when was the last
time anyone had said hers?

1683
01:33:04,361 --> 01:33:06,263
Or thought it, even?

1684
01:33:06,296 --> 01:33:08,298
Apart from me.

1685
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:12,835
And it made me so sad
because, Al...

1686
01:33:12,869 --> 01:33:17,840
you should be the one
with her name all over you.

1687
01:33:18,841 --> 01:33:21,045
No. No.

1688
01:33:21,078 --> 01:33:22,945
Don't worry.
I've sterilized everything.

1689
01:33:22,979 --> 01:33:24,914
- No.
- I really would have been a great doctor.

1690
01:33:24,947 --> 01:33:26,582
- You're insane.
- You know what?

1691
01:33:26,616 --> 01:33:28,185
I honestly don't think I am.

1692
01:33:28,218 --> 01:33:29,919
I'll do this
as quick as I can, okay?

1693
01:33:32,189 --> 01:33:34,158
Stop. Stop!

1694
01:33:34,191 --> 01:33:35,625
- Get off me!
- No!

1695
01:33:35,658 --> 01:33:37,660
Just stop fucking moving!

1696
01:33:37,693 --> 01:33:40,230
- Just stop, please! Fucking...
- No!

1697
01:33:40,264 --> 01:33:41,631
You...

1698
01:33:53,843 --> 01:33:54,877
No!

1699
01:33:54,911 --> 01:33:57,080
Fuck!

1700
01:34:23,139 --> 01:34:26,175
Stop. Stop.

1701
01:34:26,209 --> 01:34:27,977
Shit. Shit.

1702
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:37,386
This is your fucking fault!

1703
01:34:46,329 --> 01:34:48,064
Fuck it.

1704
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:56,405
Stop. Stop. Stop!

1705
01:35:00,176 --> 01:35:03,146
Fucking stop fucking moving!

1706
01:35:03,179 --> 01:35:05,281
Stop fucking moving!

1707
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,028
Stop.

1708
01:37:08,471 --> 01:37:10,406
Whoa.

1709
01:37:10,439 --> 01:37:12,374
What a night.

1710
01:37:12,408 --> 01:37:13,875
Ooh.

1711
01:37:13,908 --> 01:37:15,277
The fucking nurse?

1712
01:37:15,310 --> 01:37:17,546
Are you kidding me?

1713
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:19,482
Nice.

1714
01:37:19,515 --> 01:37:21,283
Joe.

1715
01:37:21,316 --> 01:37:23,519
Al, Al, please don't freak out,
all right?

1716
01:37:23,552 --> 01:37:25,153
Anastasia's never
gonna find out.

1717
01:37:25,186 --> 01:37:28,790
What happens on tour
stays on tour.

1718
01:37:29,424 --> 01:37:31,293
She's dead, Joe.

1719
01:37:32,327 --> 01:37:33,395
Come on.

1720
01:37:34,462 --> 01:37:35,564
I'm not kidding.

1721
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:42,037
All right, I got...
y-you're being ironic.

1722
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:43,104
What?

1723
01:37:43,138 --> 01:37:45,407
You killed the stripper
at your bachelor party?

1724
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,175
What is this, the '90s?

1725
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:49,077
Al, classic.

1726
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:51,479
Come on.
You want me to get her

1727
01:37:51,513 --> 01:37:53,281
out of here
so you can get some sleep?

1728
01:37:53,315 --> 01:37:54,582
All right.

1729
01:37:54,616 --> 01:37:57,319
All right, honey,
time for you to go.

1730
01:37:57,352 --> 01:37:59,287
Come on.

1731
01:38:01,656 --> 01:38:03,625
What is she doing?

1732
01:38:03,658 --> 01:38:05,327
Hey, honey, come on.

1733
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,961
We got to go.

1734
01:38:07,962 --> 01:38:09,864
Honey, what are we doing...

1735
01:38:09,898 --> 01:38:11,599
Jesus fucking Chr...

1736
01:38:11,633 --> 01:38:14,069
Fuck. Is she dead?

1737
01:38:16,971 --> 01:38:18,540
Al, why is
the fucking stripper dead?

1738
01:38:18,573 --> 01:38:20,041
I told you.

1739
01:38:20,075 --> 01:38:21,443
Well, how did this happen?

1740
01:38:21,476 --> 01:38:23,211
I don't know.

1741
01:38:30,285 --> 01:38:31,653
Okay. Hey.

1742
01:38:31,686 --> 01:38:34,923
Al, this is not your fault.

1743
01:38:34,956 --> 01:38:36,491
I don't know.
It kind of seems like it is.

1744
01:38:36,524 --> 01:38:38,593
No, no, no, no.

1745
01:38:38,626 --> 01:38:40,894
It's not. It's not.

1746
01:38:40,928 --> 01:38:42,997
Am-am-am I...

1747
01:38:43,031 --> 01:38:45,233
- Am I gonna go to jail?
- What?

1748
01:38:45,266 --> 01:38:48,103
- What about the wedding and-and my job?
- No.

1749
01:38:48,136 --> 01:38:51,172
Anastasia's gonna be
so upset with me.

1750
01:38:51,206 --> 01:38:52,140
Well, no, no.

1751
01:38:52,173 --> 01:38:54,542
Al, Al, Al, Al,
it was an accident, right?

1752
01:38:54,576 --> 01:38:56,478
I mean...

1753
01:38:56,511 --> 01:38:57,978
Hey!

1754
01:38:58,011 --> 01:38:58,946
It was an accident.

1755
01:38:58,979 --> 01:39:00,914
I mean, of course it was
a fucking accident.

1756
01:39:00,948 --> 01:39:02,517
Yeah, of course
it was a fucking accident.

1757
01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:03,651
No one's gonna go to jail,

1758
01:39:03,685 --> 01:39:05,653
because no one's ever
gonna find out.

1759
01:39:05,687 --> 01:39:08,656
If anybody asks,
we all saw her leave last night.

1760
01:39:08,690 --> 01:39:12,059
She stripped, and then she left.

1761
01:39:13,026 --> 01:39:15,663
- She left?
- She left.

1762
01:39:15,697 --> 01:39:17,532
Okay. All right.

1763
01:39:17,565 --> 01:39:20,535
It's gonna be fine, all right?

1764
01:39:20,568 --> 01:39:23,538
We're gonna take care of this.

1765
01:39:23,571 --> 01:39:25,340
We just got to get rid
of the body

1766
01:39:25,373 --> 01:39:26,708
before the others leave.

1767
01:39:26,741 --> 01:39:28,343
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1768
01:39:28,376 --> 01:39:29,611
It's okay. Look at me.

1769
01:39:29,644 --> 01:39:31,312
This is not your fault, Al.

1770
01:39:31,346 --> 01:39:33,448
- Thank you.
- You did nothing wrong.

1771
01:39:33,481 --> 01:39:35,417
All right. All right.

1772
01:39:35,450 --> 01:39:37,652
You did nothing wrong.

1773
01:39:37,685 --> 01:39:39,421
This is not your fault.

1774
01:39:39,454 --> 01:39:41,356
Can you uncuff me?

1775
01:39:42,624 --> 01:39:45,292
Okay, come here. Come here.

1776
01:40:53,627 --> 01:40:54,829
<i>Can't you just</i>

1777
01:40:54,863 --> 01:40:58,332
do that thing where you track
her cell phone or something?

1778
01:40:58,365 --> 01:40:59,633
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1779
01:40:59,666 --> 01:41:02,336
It was turned off
before she left.

1780
01:41:02,369 --> 01:41:04,505
Seems like she really
didn't want anyone

1781
01:41:04,538 --> 01:41:06,273
to know where she was.

1782
01:41:06,306 --> 01:41:08,208
But it-it's...

1783
01:41:08,242 --> 01:41:10,244
it's just not like her
to disappear like this.

1784
01:41:10,277 --> 01:41:12,412
Well, that's not
entirely true, honey.

1785
01:41:12,446 --> 01:41:14,248
Stanley.

1786
01:41:14,281 --> 01:41:17,818
I... You know, she's...

1787
01:41:17,851 --> 01:41:20,053
she was getting better.

1788
01:41:20,087 --> 01:41:21,588
She was, really.

1789
01:41:21,622 --> 01:41:23,657
- She was getting better.
- Yes, she was.

1790
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:25,626
She... Of course she was.

1791
01:41:25,659 --> 01:41:27,728
She'll come back.

1792
01:41:27,761 --> 01:41:29,530
You know how she is.

1793
01:41:29,563 --> 01:41:31,164
She always comes back.

1794
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:32,799
Was she seeing anyone?

1795
01:41:32,833 --> 01:41:35,135
Did she have a boyfriend?

1796
01:41:36,670 --> 01:41:37,804
Yes.

1797
01:41:37,838 --> 01:41:39,840
Are you Dr. Cooper?

1798
01:41:39,873 --> 01:41:41,375
Yeah.

1799
01:41:41,408 --> 01:41:43,577
Detective Waller.

1800
01:41:45,579 --> 01:41:49,048
Yeah. Uh, come in, please.

1801
01:41:51,385 --> 01:41:52,753
Have a seat.

1802
01:41:52,786 --> 01:41:54,555
Pediatric surgeon, huh?

1803
01:41:54,588 --> 01:41:55,789
Yeah.

1804
01:41:55,822 --> 01:41:57,391
That's very commendable.

1805
01:41:57,424 --> 01:42:00,460
Thank you for all that you do
for the community.

1806
01:42:00,494 --> 01:42:02,128
Sure. Yeah.

1807
01:42:02,162 --> 01:42:05,097
I'm sorry to bother you
at work, Doctor.

1808
01:42:05,131 --> 01:42:07,634
Do you know a Cassandra Thomas?

1809
01:42:09,369 --> 01:42:10,771
Yeah. Yes.

1810
01:42:10,804 --> 01:42:12,104
Yes.

1811
01:42:12,138 --> 01:42:14,274
- How do you know her?
- We were...

1812
01:42:15,742 --> 01:42:18,177
We were seeing each other.

1813
01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:20,179
Were seeing each other?

1814
01:42:20,212 --> 01:42:22,716
We broke up a few days ago.

1815
01:42:22,749 --> 01:42:24,585
Define "a few days."

1816
01:42:25,619 --> 01:42:26,853
Last Thursday.

1817
01:42:26,887 --> 01:42:30,189
Have you had any contact since?

1818
01:42:30,222 --> 01:42:32,492
No. I'm sorry,
what is this regarding?

1819
01:42:32,526 --> 01:42:35,829
Cassandra's parents have filed
a missing persons report.

1820
01:42:35,862 --> 01:42:37,598
I'm sorry, what?

1821
01:42:37,631 --> 01:42:38,832
Why?

1822
01:42:38,865 --> 01:42:41,568
Because she's missing.

1823
01:42:41,602 --> 01:42:44,136
Since when?

1824
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:45,505
Since Friday.

1825
01:42:45,539 --> 01:42:47,641
She told her parents
something about a work trip,

1826
01:42:47,674 --> 01:42:49,910
but her colleague didn't know
anything about it.

1827
01:42:49,943 --> 01:42:52,244
Do you have any idea
where she might have been

1828
01:42:52,278 --> 01:42:54,413
going to this weekend?

1829
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:59,653
She mentioned, uh,
the work trip.

1830
01:42:59,686 --> 01:43:02,221
- Yeah.
- Any idea where?

1831
01:43:04,256 --> 01:43:07,594
N-No. No.

1832
01:43:07,628 --> 01:43:10,262
I'm sorry.

1833
01:43:10,296 --> 01:43:11,932
That's all right, Doc.

1834
01:43:11,965 --> 01:43:13,900
Between you and me, it, uh,

1835
01:43:13,934 --> 01:43:16,569
sounded like she wasn't
feeling so good.

1836
01:43:16,603 --> 01:43:18,204
Mentally, I mean.

1837
01:43:18,237 --> 01:43:21,540
Her father seemed to think
she was a little unstable.

1838
01:43:23,275 --> 01:43:25,846
Yeah, she was...

1839
01:43:25,879 --> 01:43:29,348
not in a good place.

1840
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:35,287
Do you think she might have
wanted to hurt herself?

1841
01:43:39,458 --> 01:43:40,626
Yeah.

1842
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:43,262
Uh, she could've.

1843
01:43:43,295 --> 01:43:45,364
She could've, yeah.

1844
01:43:45,398 --> 01:43:48,267
I thought that might
be the case.

1845
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:50,469
Thank you for your honesty.

1846
01:43:50,503 --> 01:43:52,371
Well, I don't want
to bother you anymore,

1847
01:43:52,405 --> 01:43:54,440
but if you wouldn't mind coming
to the station tomorrow,

1848
01:43:54,473 --> 01:43:55,842
you know,
for an official statement.

1849
01:43:55,876 --> 01:43:57,844
Of course.
Anything I can do to help.

1850
01:43:57,878 --> 01:43:59,245
Thank you for your time,
Doctor.

1851
01:43:59,278 --> 01:44:01,313
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

1852
01:44:01,347 --> 01:44:02,848
That's cute.

1853
01:44:02,883 --> 01:44:05,418
Yeah.

1854
01:44:18,731 --> 01:44:22,501
Anastasia, you're the greatest
thing that ever happened to me.

1855
01:44:22,535 --> 01:44:25,604
You are my moral compass
and the love of my life.

1856
01:44:25,638 --> 01:44:28,307
Al, you are my best friend

1857
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:30,476
and my soul mate.

1858
01:44:30,509 --> 01:44:31,944
I love you.

1859
01:44:31,977 --> 01:44:33,479
Al's like a brother to me.

1860
01:44:33,512 --> 01:44:34,914
We grew up together. We're...

1861
01:44:34,947 --> 01:44:36,248
We're the best of friends.

1862
01:44:36,282 --> 01:44:37,550
We've been through
thick and thin.

1863
01:44:37,583 --> 01:44:40,586
And-and I just love him.

1864
01:44:40,619 --> 01:44:43,422
And, you know,
he's met Anastasia, who,

1865
01:44:43,456 --> 01:44:46,726
by all accounts, is,
you know, just a solid catch.

1866
01:44:54,533 --> 01:44:55,835
That's great.

1867
01:44:58,437 --> 01:45:00,873
- How you doing, man?
- Hey.

1868
01:45:00,906 --> 01:45:03,409
See that bridesmaid over there?

1869
01:45:03,442 --> 01:45:05,411
Whew. Just the type of girl
that makes you

1870
01:45:05,444 --> 01:45:07,713
go home to your wife
and say...

1871
01:45:07,747 --> 01:45:10,349
You know she trained
at Cirque du Soleil?

1872
01:45:10,382 --> 01:45:13,018
Come on her ass and her face
at the same time.

1873
01:45:13,052 --> 01:45:15,020
- That's nice.
- Unbelievable.

1874
01:45:15,054 --> 01:45:16,388
- Everything just turned out so nice.
- Yeah.

1875
01:45:16,422 --> 01:45:17,423
It's good seeing you.

1876
01:45:17,456 --> 01:45:19,625
Good. Yeah, you, too.

1877
01:45:21,527 --> 01:45:23,362
- Hi. How are you?
- Oh, hey, Joe. - Hey.

1878
01:45:23,395 --> 01:45:24,864
- Hey, it's good to see you.
- Good speech.

1879
01:45:24,897 --> 01:45:27,500
- I'm going to get a drink.
- Cheers.

1880
01:47:51,209 --> 01:47:53,511
- You're Alexander Monroe?
- Uh, yeah.

1881
01:47:53,544 --> 01:47:54,913
You're under arrest
for the murder

1882
01:47:54,946 --> 01:47:56,648
- of Cassandra Thomas.
- No, no, no, no.

1883
01:47:56,681 --> 01:47:57,649
Officer,
please remove the bride.

1884
01:47:57,682 --> 01:47:58,716
I'm sorry, this is a mistake.

1885
01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:00,818
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Excuse me!

1886
01:48:00,852 --> 01:48:03,121
Can you explain
what's going on? Al!

1887
01:48:05,857 --> 01:48:07,125
- Sir...
- Hey, hey!

1888
01:48:08,559 --> 01:48:09,994
You have the right
to an attorney.

1889
01:48:10,028 --> 01:48:12,530
If you can't afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

1890
01:48:12,563 --> 01:48:13,932
- Understand, sir?
- Yes.

1891
01:48:13,965 --> 01:48:16,834
Officer, show him to the car.

1892
