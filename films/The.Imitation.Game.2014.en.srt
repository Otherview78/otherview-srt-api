1
00:01:16,314 --> 00:01:18,106
Are you paying attention?

2
00:01:21,486 --> 00:01:22,611
Good.

3
00:01:24,155 --> 00:01:27,574
If you're not listening
carefully you will miss things.

4
00:01:29,077 --> 00:01:30,494
Important things.

5
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:33,831
I will not pause,
I will not repeat myself

6
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:36,625
and you will not interrupt me.

7
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,839
If you think that
because you're sitting where you are

8
00:01:41,923 --> 00:01:43,340
and I am sitting where I am

9
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:47,594
that you are in control
of what is about to happen,

10
00:01:48,805 --> 00:01:50,347
you're mistaken.

11
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:52,641
I am in control,

12
00:01:52,725 --> 00:01:55,727
because I know things
that you do not know.

13
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,025
Manchester Police Department.
Please hold.

14
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,610
Looks like a break-in.

15
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,863
Residence of Turing, Alan.

16
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:07,990
Window's broken. Home's been ransacked.

17
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:10,117
Send a detective down, will you?

18
00:02:11,286 --> 00:02:12,995
What I will need from you now

19
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:15,080
is a commitment.

20
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:19,918
You will listen closely and you will not
judge me until I am finished.

21
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:23,881
If you cannot commit to this,
then please leave the room.

22
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:26,133
Come in.

23
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:29,261
But if you choose to stay,
remember, you chose to be here.

24
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:33,390
What happens from this moment
forward is not my responsibility.

25
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:35,392
It's yours.

26
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:40,772
Pay attention.

27
00:02:54,037 --> 00:02:55,203
What's all this, then?

28
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:57,998
Turing, Alan.
Professor at King's.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,710
- Seems to have been a burglary.
- Oh? What of?

30
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:03,670
Well, that's just it.
Nothing missing, really.

31
00:03:05,214 --> 00:03:06,882
What's he doing in Manchester?

32
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:10,010
Something with machines.

33
00:03:17,602 --> 00:03:19,561
The project at the NPL.

34
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:22,230
I checked
but he won't say what it's on.

35
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:25,609
Professor Turing?

36
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:28,111
Detective Nock, Manchester Police.

37
00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:35,202
Sergeant Staehl here tells me
you had a burglary last night.

38
00:03:36,454 --> 00:03:37,579
Professor Turing?

39
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:41,583
Take a step back
and don't breathe heavily.

40
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:44,252
- Breathe?
- Undiluted cyanide.

41
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,714
It wouldn't take more
than a thimbleful to kill you.

42
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:49,800
Ah.

43
00:03:51,552 --> 00:03:53,762
- Disappointing.
- Pardon?

44
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,890
I had hoped for a bit more.

45
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:59,851
Sergeant Staehl, is it just me or do you
get the sense that we're being insulted?

46
00:04:00,645 --> 00:04:02,646
Last night you had a break-in.

47
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,232
Your neighbour Mr Springborn
called to report the noise.

48
00:04:05,316 --> 00:04:06,942
He said there was quite a ruckus.

49
00:04:07,026 --> 00:04:09,611
Only you say nothing was taken.
It's odd.

50
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:12,364
So how about you tell us what happened
and we'll find the chap who did this.

51
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:14,574
Gentlemen,

52
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,619
I don't believe that you could find
the chap that did this

53
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:20,622
if he walked up to you
and spat in your face.

54
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:25,043
What I could use right now is not
a bobby but a really good cleaning lady.

55
00:04:25,128 --> 00:04:27,796
So unless one of you has an apron
in your car,

56
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,091
I suggest you file your reports
and leave me alone.

57
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:35,012
As you say, Professor Turing.

58
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,518
Best of luck with your cyanide.

59
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,022
I'll give you a quid if you
can name me a more insufferable sod.

60
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:46,982
Seemed a bit forced, though, didn't it?

61
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:48,608
Don't know what you mean.

62
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:50,152
Well, if you didn't
want a pair of bobbies

63
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:51,570
digging around in your personal affairs,

64
00:04:51,654 --> 00:04:54,489
that'd have been a stellar way
to make sure they don't.

65
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:57,325
Tell me you don't think
this is suspicious.

66
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,452
I don't think this is suspicious.

67
00:04:58,828 --> 00:05:00,662
A mysterious professor who won't admit

68
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:02,539
he's had something stolen
from his house?

69
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:07,169
I think Alan Turing's hiding something.

70
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:20,766
War declared!
800,000 children evacuated!

71
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,726
German bombs on their way!

72
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,977
Get your papers here.

73
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:25,145
Fresh off the press.

74
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:26,480
War declared!

75
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:28,857
800,000 children evacuated!

76
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:30,525
German bombs expected soon!

77
00:05:31,194 --> 00:05:32,235
Get your papers here.

78
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,403
Fresh off the press.

79
00:05:56,677 --> 00:06:00,597
This morning,
the British Ambassador in Berlin

80
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:04,434
handed the German government
a final note,

81
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:07,354
stating that unless we heard from them

82
00:06:07,438 --> 00:06:09,147
by 11 o'clock,

83
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:12,317
a state of war would exist between us.

84
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:15,445
I have to tell you now

85
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,780
that no such undertaking

86
00:06:16,864 --> 00:06:18,198
has been received.

87
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:20,867
And that consequently,

88
00:06:20,952 --> 00:06:24,371
this country is at war with Germany.

89
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:52,941
For the second time

90
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:55,026
in the lives of most of us,

91
00:06:55,778 --> 00:06:58,613
we are at war.

92
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:02,117
We have tried to find

93
00:07:02,243 --> 00:07:04,911
a peaceful way out...

94
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,249
Papers, please.

95
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,873
- What are you doing here?
- Uh, the lady told me to wait.

96
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,499
In my office?

97
00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:54,794
Did she tell you to help yourself to tea
while you were here?

98
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:57,297
Uh... No, she didn't.

99
00:07:57,965 --> 00:08:00,800
She obviously didn't tell you
what a joke was then, either, I gather?

100
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:02,636
Was she supposed to?

101
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,015
- Who are you?
- Alan Turing.

102
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,562
- Ah, Turing. The mathematician.
- Correct.

103
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:14,314
However could I have guessed?

104
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:16,358
You didn't.
You just read it on that piece of paper.

105
00:08:18,527 --> 00:08:20,070
King's College, Cambridge.

106
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:23,365
Now it says here you were a bit
of a prodigy in the Maths Department.

107
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:26,368
I'm not sure I can evaluate that, Mr...

108
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:28,620
- How old are you, Mr Turing?
- Uh, 27.

109
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:30,997
And how old were you when you
became a fellow at Cambridge?

110
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:32,249
Twenty-four.

111
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,376
And how old were you
when you published this paper

112
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:36,253
that has a title
that I can barely understand?

113
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:38,213
Uh, 23.

114
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,174
And you don't think that qualifies you
as a certified prodigy?

115
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:44,469
Well, Newton discovered Binomial Theorem
aged 22.

116
00:08:44,553 --> 00:08:48,223
Einstein wrote four papers that changed
the world by the age of 26.

117
00:08:48,349 --> 00:08:51,685
As far as I can tell, I've...
I've barely made par.

118
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,980
- My God, you're serious.
- Would you prefer I made a joke?

119
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:57,357
Oh, I don't think you know
what those are.

120
00:08:57,441 --> 00:08:58,984
Hardly seems fair
that that's a requirement

121
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:00,527
for employment here, Mr...

122
00:09:00,611 --> 00:09:02,362
Commander Denniston, Royal Navy.

123
00:09:02,446 --> 00:09:03,989
All right, Mr Turing, I'll bite.

124
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:06,366
Why do you wish to work
for His Majesty's Government?

125
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:08,243
Oh, I don't, really.

126
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,246
Are you a bleeding pacifist?

127
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:14,416
I'm agnostic about violence.

128
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,252
But you do realise that 600 miles
away from London

129
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:19,379
there's this nasty little chap
called Hitler

130
00:09:19,463 --> 00:09:21,423
who wants to engulf Europe in tyranny?

131
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:24,092
Politics isn't really my area
of expertise.

132
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:25,593
Really?

133
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,554
Well, I believe
you've just set the record

134
00:09:27,638 --> 00:09:30,265
for the shortest job interview
in British military history.

135
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:31,891
Oh, uh...

136
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:33,560
Mother says I can be
off-putting sometimes

137
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:35,729
on account of being one of the best
mathematicians in the world.

138
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,565
- In the world?
- Oh, yes.

139
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:42,736
Do you know how many people
I've rejected for this programme?

140
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,070
- No.
- That's right.

141
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:45,864
Because we're a top secret programme.

142
00:09:45,948 --> 00:09:48,074
But I'll tell you,
just because we're friends,

143
00:09:48,242 --> 00:09:52,620
that only last week I rejected
one of our great nation's top linguists.

144
00:09:52,747 --> 00:09:55,040
Knows German better than Bertolt Brecht.

145
00:09:55,124 --> 00:09:56,958
- I don't speak German.
- What?

146
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:01,087
I don't speak German.

147
00:10:01,172 --> 00:10:04,090
Well, how the hell are you supposed
to decrypt German communications

148
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:06,676
if you don't...
I don't know, speak German?

149
00:10:06,802 --> 00:10:08,762
Well, I'm really quite excellent
at crossword puzzles.

150
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:10,805
Margaret!

151
00:10:10,931 --> 00:10:14,559
German codes are a puzzle.
A game just like any other game.

152
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:16,144
- Margaret, where are you?
- I'm really very good at games,

153
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,270
uh, puzzles.

154
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:19,856
And this is the most difficult puzzle
in the world.

155
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,441
Margaret!

156
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:22,942
For the love of God.

157
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:24,611
This is a joke, obviously.

158
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,282
I'm afraid I don't know what those are,
Commander Denniston.

159
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,951
Have a pleasant trip back
to Cambridge, Professor.

160
00:10:32,036 --> 00:10:33,036
Enigma.

161
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:34,704
You called for me?

162
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:47,592
That's what you're doing here.
The top secret programme at Bletchley.

163
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:50,845
You're trying to break
the German Enigma machine.

164
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,306
What makes you think that?

165
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:56,142
It's the greatest encryption device
in history

166
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:59,479
and the Germans use it
for all major communications.

167
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:02,690
If the Allies broke Enigma, well,

168
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:07,362
this would turn into
a very short war indeed.

169
00:11:07,696 --> 00:11:10,240
Of course that's what you're working on.

170
00:11:10,324 --> 00:11:11,699
You also haven't got anywhere with it.

171
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:14,661
If you had, you wouldn't be hiring
cryptographers out of university.

172
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:17,205
You need me a lot more than I need you.

173
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:20,417
I... I like solving problems, Commander.

174
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:25,171
And Enigma is the most difficult
problem in the world.

175
00:11:25,548 --> 00:11:27,674
Oh, Enigma isn't difficult.
It's impossible.

176
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:30,176
The Americans,
the Russians, the French,

177
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:33,555
the Germans.
Everyone thinks Enigma is unbreakable.

178
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:37,851
Good. Let me try,
then we'll know for sure, won't we?

179
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:42,188
Welcome to Enigma.

180
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:50,196
The details of every surprise attack,
every secret convoy,

181
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:54,534
and every U-boat in the bloody Atlantic
go into that thing

182
00:11:55,703 --> 00:11:57,871
and out comes gibberish.

183
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,915
It's beautiful.

184
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:04,210
It's the crooked hand of death itself.

185
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:08,715
Our Wrens intercept thousands
of radio messages a day.

186
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,343
And to the lovely young ladies
of the Women's Royal Navy,

187
00:12:12,428 --> 00:12:13,720
they're nonsense.

188
00:12:14,388 --> 00:12:17,557
It's only when you feed them back
into Enigma that they make any sense.

189
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:19,309
But we have an Enigma machine.

190
00:12:19,393 --> 00:12:22,061
Yes, Polish Intelligence
smuggled it out of Berlin.

191
00:12:22,146 --> 00:12:23,188
So what's the problem?

192
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:25,607
Just put the intercepted messages
back into the Enigma and...

193
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:28,735
Look, it's not that simple. Is it?

194
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:32,739
Just having an Enigma machine
doesn't help you to decode the messages.

195
00:12:33,574 --> 00:12:35,408
Very good, Mr Turing.

196
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:38,912
To decode a message, you need
to know the machine's settings.

197
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,708
Now, the Germans switch settings
every day, promptly at midnight.

198
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:47,253
We usually intercept our first message
around 6:00am.

199
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:52,675
Which gives you exactly
18 hours every day to crack the code

200
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,094
before it changes and you start again.

201
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,765
Five rotors. 10 plugboard cables.

202
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:01,184
- That's one million...
- 1,000 million.

203
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:02,894
- No, it's... I've got it.
- It's a million million.

204
00:13:02,978 --> 00:13:04,437
Well, it's in the millions,
obviously.

205
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:07,524
There's over 150 million million million
possible settings.

206
00:13:07,816 --> 00:13:09,275
Very good.

207
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:12,946
One hundred and fifty-nine,
if you want to be exact about it,

208
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,282
1-5-9 with 18 zeros behind it.

209
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:17,951
Possibilities.

210
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:19,953
Every single day.

211
00:13:20,037 --> 00:13:22,497
Gentlemen,
meet Hugh Alexander.

212
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:25,833
I personally selected him
to run this unit.

213
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,001
Didn't you...

214
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:29,128
Mr Alexander won Britain's
national chess championship.

215
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,006
- Twice.
- You're not the only one

216
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:34,801
who's good at games round here, Turing.

217
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:38,346
Are we to work together, then?
I prefer to have my own office.

218
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:39,973
You're a team and you will work as one.

219
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:43,226
I don't have time to explain myself
as I go along

220
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,812
and I'm afraid these men
would only slow me down.

221
00:13:46,814 --> 00:13:48,064
If you can't play together,

222
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:50,275
then I'm afraid
we can't let you play at all.

223
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:52,277
This is Stewart Menzies. MI6.

224
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:54,946
There are only five divisions
of Military Intelligence.

225
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,740
- There is no MI6.
- Exactly.

226
00:13:57,825 --> 00:13:59,325
That's the spirit.

227
00:14:00,744 --> 00:14:03,329
Mr Turing, do you know
how many British servicemen have died

228
00:14:03,414 --> 00:14:04,664
because of Enigma?

229
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:07,083
- Uh, no, I don't.
- Three.

230
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:10,336
While we've been having
this conversation.

231
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,090
Oh, look, there's another.

232
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:17,051
I rather hope he didn't have a family.

233
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:20,430
This war Commander Denniston's
been going on about,

234
00:14:21,181 --> 00:14:22,557
we're not winning it.

235
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:25,518
Break the code,
at least we have a chance.

236
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:31,691
Shall we leave the children alone
with their new toy?

237
00:14:37,072 --> 00:14:38,531
All right, gentlemen...

238
00:14:42,077 --> 00:14:43,453
let's play.

239
00:14:46,582 --> 00:14:49,208
The game was quite a simple one.

240
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:53,963
Every single German message,

241
00:14:54,048 --> 00:14:56,883
every surprise attack,
every bombing run,

242
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:58,009
every, uh...

243
00:14:58,093 --> 00:15:00,386
...imminent U-boat assault.

244
00:15:05,392 --> 00:15:07,602
They were all floating
through the air.

245
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:18,946
Radio signals that,

246
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,993
well, any schoolboy
with an AM kit could intercept.

247
00:15:27,331 --> 00:15:29,666
The trick was that they were encrypted.

248
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:42,929
One hundred and fifty-nine
million million million

249
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:44,889
possible Enigma settings.

250
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:48,559
All we had to do was try each one.

251
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:54,482
But if we had 10 men
checking one setting a minute

252
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:58,945
for 24 hours every day
and seven days every week,

253
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:05,451
how many days do you think it would take
to check each of the settings?

254
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,957
It's not days, it's years.

255
00:16:12,793 --> 00:16:15,795
It's 20 million years.

256
00:16:17,297 --> 00:16:18,673
To stop a coming attack,

257
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,136
we would have to check
20 million years' worth of settings

258
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:25,638
in 20 minutes.

259
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,084
I'm famished. Lunch?

260
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:59,338
Good Lord, what is it about women
with little hats?

261
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:09,557
The boys...
We're going to get some lunch.

262
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:15,313
Alan?

263
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:17,940
- Yes?
- I said we're going to get some lunch.

264
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,404
- Alan?
- Yes?

265
00:17:23,697 --> 00:17:25,907
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

266
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,367
I said we're off to get some...

267
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:30,536
This is starting to get
a little bit repetitive.

268
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:31,704
What is?

269
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,581
I had asked if you wanted
to come to lunch with us.

270
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:35,249
Er, no, you didn't.

271
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,460
You said you were going
to get some lunch.

272
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:39,587
Have I offended you in some way?

273
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:41,088
Why would you think that?

274
00:17:41,965 --> 00:17:43,424
Would you like to come
to lunch with us?

275
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,592
What time's lunchtime?

276
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:47,553
- Christ, Alan, it's a bleeding sandwich.
- What is?

277
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:50,681
- Lunch.
- I don't like sandwiches.

278
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:52,225
Never mind.

279
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,854
You know, to pull off
this irascible genius routine,

280
00:17:56,939 --> 00:17:58,815
one actually has to be a genius, Alan.

281
00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:01,317
And yet we're the ones
making progress here, aren't we?

282
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:02,819
You are?

283
00:18:02,945 --> 00:18:04,403
Yes, we are.

284
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:08,366
We have decrypted a number
of German messages

285
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,952
by analysing the frequency
of letter distribution.

286
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,080
Oh, even a broken clock is right
twice a day.

287
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:16,415
That's not progress.
That's just blind luck.

288
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,419
I'm designing a machine that will
allow us to break every message,

289
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:23,297
every day, instantly.

290
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:26,926
Who's hungry?

291
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:30,096
- Let's go.
- I'm hungry.

292
00:18:32,432 --> 00:18:35,142
- What?
- Peter asked who was hungry.

293
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:36,644
Can I have some soup, please?

294
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:06,067
What do you mean, classified?

295
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:09,654
No, I am aware of the literal meaning
of the word "classified",

296
00:20:09,738 --> 00:20:11,364
what I'm asking is
why would a maths professor

297
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:13,532
have his military records classified?

298
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:17,578
Yeah, well, I will come down.

299
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:40,851
Pardon me, I'd like to see
some documents, if I may.

300
00:20:40,936 --> 00:20:44,355
Service records of a Mr... Turing, Alan.

301
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:47,274
Foreign Office sent me.

302
00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:55,241
This is unacceptable.

303
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,868
If you wish to discuss a complaint,

304
00:20:57,953 --> 00:20:59,370
I suggest you make a proper appointment.

305
00:20:59,454 --> 00:21:01,080
Alexander... Complaint?

306
00:21:01,748 --> 00:21:06,127
No. No, Hugh Alexander has denied
my requisition for parts and equipment

307
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:07,670
that I need to build the machine
I have designed.

308
00:21:07,754 --> 00:21:10,131
Your fellow code-breakers
are refusing to work with you

309
00:21:10,257 --> 00:21:11,882
and they've filed a formal complaint.

310
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:13,634
It is inspired
by an old Polish code machine,

311
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,387
only this one is
infinitely more advanced.

312
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:17,930
If you don't respond to the complaint,

313
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:19,807
I shall have to take it up
with the Home Office.

314
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,350
Put those files by my desk.

315
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:22,893
Fine. My response is they're all idiots,

316
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:25,021
fire them and use the savings
to fund my machine.

317
00:21:25,105 --> 00:21:27,481
I only need about £100,000.

318
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:30,276
£100,000?

319
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:33,654
Why are you building a machine?

320
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:36,991
It's highly technical,
you wouldn't understand.

321
00:21:37,117 --> 00:21:39,326
I suggest you make the effort to try.

322
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:44,999
Enigma is an extremely
well-designed machine.

323
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,169
Our problem is that
we're only using men to try to beat it.

324
00:21:48,295 --> 00:21:51,797
What if only a machine
can defeat another machine?

325
00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:54,050
Well, that's not very technical.

326
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:56,594
Hugh Alexander
is in charge of your unit.

327
00:21:56,678 --> 00:21:58,137
He said no and that is that.

328
00:21:58,513 --> 00:22:00,014
I simply don't have time for this.

329
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,725
Have you ever won a war, Turing?

330
00:22:03,977 --> 00:22:06,145
I have. Do you know how it's done?

331
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,231
Order. Discipline. Chain of command.

332
00:22:09,816 --> 00:22:11,525
You're not at university any longer.

333
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:14,779
You are a very small cog
in a very large system

334
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:18,032
and you will do
as your commanding officer instructs.

335
00:22:21,995 --> 00:22:24,330
Who... Who is your commanding officer?

336
00:22:25,874 --> 00:22:29,543
Winston Churchill,
Number 10 Downing Street, London SW1.

337
00:22:30,003 --> 00:22:33,214
You have a problem with my decision,
you can take it up with him.

338
00:22:39,846 --> 00:22:42,348
Mr Menzies. Mr Menzies!

339
00:22:45,894 --> 00:22:47,728
Are you going to London?

340
00:22:48,855 --> 00:22:52,691
- Possibly.
- Would you deliver a letter for me?

341
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:01,534
Look, I'm sorry, but are you joking?

342
00:23:02,035 --> 00:23:04,036
Churchill's put Alan in charge?

343
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:06,497
- This is a terrible idea.
- No, no, no...

344
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:08,916
So I can give these men orders now?

345
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:11,001
I hate to say it but yes.

346
00:23:11,086 --> 00:23:13,045
Excellent. Keith and Charles,
you're both fired.

347
00:23:13,964 --> 00:23:15,756
- Excuse me?
- What?

348
00:23:15,882 --> 00:23:18,551
You're mediocre linguists
and positively poor code-breakers.

349
00:23:18,635 --> 00:23:21,053
Alan, you can't just fire
Keith and Charles.

350
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:22,513
Well, he just said I could.

351
00:23:22,597 --> 00:23:24,056
No, I did no such thing.

352
00:23:24,224 --> 00:23:25,641
But Churchill did.

353
00:23:35,902 --> 00:23:37,403
Go to hell.

354
00:23:42,576 --> 00:23:45,077
Well, this is inhuman.

355
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,496
Even for you.

356
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,253
Popular at school, were you?

357
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:01,677
The problem began, of course,

358
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:03,262
with the carrots.

359
00:24:04,181 --> 00:24:05,598
The carrots are orange.

360
00:24:06,683 --> 00:24:10,144
The peas are green. They mustn't touch.

361
00:24:35,212 --> 00:24:37,338
Do you know why people like violence?

362
00:24:38,632 --> 00:24:41,550
It is because it feels good.

363
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:45,304
Humans find violence deeply satisfying.

364
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,476
But remove the satisfaction

365
00:24:51,478 --> 00:24:54,730
and the act becomes hollow.

366
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:02,738
Turing?

367
00:25:03,657 --> 00:25:05,157
Come on.

368
00:25:05,492 --> 00:25:06,867
Don't be such a kike about it.

369
00:25:09,037 --> 00:25:10,913
Leave him to bloody rot.

370
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:19,713
I didn't learn this on my own,
of course.

371
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,215
I had help.

372
00:25:22,717 --> 00:25:24,510
Christopher helped.

373
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:28,514
Alan, are you all right?

374
00:25:34,562 --> 00:25:38,190
It's not my fault.
The carrots got in with the peas and...

375
00:25:39,526 --> 00:25:41,527
I'm sorry, I won't let them do it again.

376
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:43,028
They're getting worse.

377
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,198
They only beat me up
because I'm smarter than they are.

378
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:48,200
No, they beat you up
because you're different.

379
00:25:48,868 --> 00:25:51,745
- Mother says I'm just an odd duck.
- And she's right.

380
00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:54,498
But you know, Alan,

381
00:25:54,582 --> 00:25:57,626
sometimes it's the very people
who no one imagines anything of

382
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:00,921
who do the things no one can imagine.

383
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,887
So what do we do now?

384
00:26:10,432 --> 00:26:14,143
- We're short on staff.
- Well, we, uh, we get more staff, then.

385
00:26:14,978 --> 00:26:17,479
And how do you propose to do that?

386
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,922
Erm, Alan Turing
to see Stewart Menzies.

387
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:50,549
Very good, sir.

388
00:28:50,925 --> 00:28:52,384
So who are they?

389
00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:55,929
Oh, all sorts, really.
A teacher. An engineer.

390
00:28:56,055 --> 00:28:57,556
A handful of students.

391
00:28:57,891 --> 00:28:59,391
And you think
they're qualified for Bletchley

392
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:00,767
'cause they're good
at crossword puzzles?

393
00:29:01,144 --> 00:29:03,937
Well, they say they're good
and now we shall find out, won't we?

394
00:29:05,565 --> 00:29:06,940
In order to aid your efforts,

395
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:09,651
there is, to the right of you,
a green scratch card book.

396
00:29:09,736 --> 00:29:12,196
You are to make notes in that.
Gentlemen, you have six minutes

397
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,115
in which to complete the puzzle,
at which point I will...

398
00:29:17,785 --> 00:29:19,328
Pardon me, ma'am,
this room's restricted.

399
00:29:19,412 --> 00:29:22,080
Oh, apologies for my tardiness.
The bus caught a flat tyre.

400
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:24,750
May I continue, please? Thank you.

401
00:29:25,752 --> 00:29:28,504
- You're not allowed in here, ma'am.
- Oh, but I'm only a few minutes late...

402
00:29:28,588 --> 00:29:31,924
The secretaries are to head upstairs.
This room's for the candidates.

403
00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:34,092
May I get on with this now, please?

404
00:29:35,428 --> 00:29:37,429
- Uh, I am a candidate.
- For what position?

405
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:38,931
The letter didn't say, precisely.

406
00:29:39,015 --> 00:29:40,474
Yes, the secretaries
are to head upstairs.

407
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,309
It did say that it was top secret.

408
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,478
What is going on?

409
00:29:44,604 --> 00:29:47,231
I... I solved a crossword puzzle
in the newspaper

410
00:29:47,315 --> 00:29:48,732
and I got this letter saying

411
00:29:48,816 --> 00:29:50,984
that I was a candidate
for some sort of mysterious job.

412
00:29:51,277 --> 00:29:52,778
My name's Joan Clarke.

413
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:55,781
Miss, did you really solve
this puzzle yourself?

414
00:29:58,785 --> 00:30:00,452
What makes you think
I couldn't solve the puzzle myself?

415
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:01,870
I'm really very good at...

416
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:03,247
Ma'am, I'll have to ask you to...

417
00:30:03,331 --> 00:30:08,293
Miss Clarke, I find tardiness
under any circumstance unacceptable.

418
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:15,008
Take a seat so that we may continue.

419
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:19,638
Thank you.

420
00:30:20,807 --> 00:30:22,432
Now, as I was saying,

421
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:26,812
you have six minutes
to complete the task in front of you.

422
00:30:27,814 --> 00:30:29,481
Erm, gentlemen, and lady...

423
00:30:29,983 --> 00:30:31,358
begin.

424
00:30:59,846 --> 00:31:01,221
Six minutes.

425
00:31:02,348 --> 00:31:05,392
- Is that even possible?
- No, no. Takes me eight.

426
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:07,811
This isn't about crossword puzzles.

427
00:31:07,895 --> 00:31:10,897
It's about how one approaches
solving an impossible problem.

428
00:31:12,025 --> 00:31:14,776
Do you tackle the whole thing
at once or divide it into small...

429
00:31:17,071 --> 00:31:18,196
You've finished?

430
00:31:18,364 --> 00:31:19,740
Yes.

431
00:31:34,297 --> 00:31:35,922
Five minutes and 34 seconds.

432
00:31:36,883 --> 00:31:38,634
You said to do it in under six.

433
00:31:39,927 --> 00:31:41,386
Congratulations.

434
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:44,139
My warmest welcome
to His Majesty's Service.

435
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:46,892
If you speak a word
of what I'm about to show you,

436
00:31:46,976 --> 00:31:48,727
you will be executed for high treason.

437
00:31:50,271 --> 00:31:52,481
You will lie to your friends,
your family

438
00:31:52,565 --> 00:31:55,567
and everyone you meet
about what it is you really do.

439
00:31:57,487 --> 00:31:59,738
And what is it that we're really doing?

440
00:32:00,073 --> 00:32:03,241
We're going to break an unbreakable
Nazi code and win the war.

441
00:32:04,744 --> 00:32:06,244
Oh.

442
00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:17,798
What's that you're reading?

443
00:32:18,925 --> 00:32:21,802
- It's about cryptography.
- Like secret messages?

444
00:32:23,262 --> 00:32:26,264
Not secret. That's the brilliant part.

445
00:32:26,974 --> 00:32:29,601
Messages that anyone can see
but no one knows what they mean

446
00:32:29,936 --> 00:32:31,603
unless you have the key.

447
00:32:37,318 --> 00:32:39,611
How's that different from talking?

448
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,280
- Talking?
- When people talk to each other,

449
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:45,242
they never say what they mean,
they say something else.

450
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:48,245
And you're expected
to just know what they mean.

451
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:49,871
Only I never do.

452
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:51,832
So...

453
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:53,875
how's that different?

454
00:32:55,294 --> 00:32:58,338
Alan, I have a funny feeling
you're going to be very good at this.

455
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,907
Goodnight, Alan.

456
00:33:30,913 --> 00:33:32,414
Goodnight.

457
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:54,436
Careful, will you? It's not a toy.

458
00:33:54,896 --> 00:33:56,855
Funny. Looks like a toy.

459
00:33:57,231 --> 00:34:01,193
Bloody great £100,000 one.
Your new minion's arrived.

460
00:34:02,028 --> 00:34:04,362
- Jack Good. We met...
- Well, where's Miss Clarke?

461
00:34:08,117 --> 00:34:09,701
Lovely, isn't he?

462
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:14,456
It's not just a usual
humdrum production mill factory.

463
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:19,419
I mean, well, as I was saying,
it's a very important radio factory.

464
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:21,338
It's not, actually.

465
00:34:21,422 --> 00:34:26,760
On the spectrum of radio
factories, this one is particularly...

466
00:34:37,563 --> 00:34:40,190
Why are you not at Bletchley?

467
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:42,859
Thank you so much for your visit,
Mr Turing.

468
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:45,320
- Was your trip pleasant?
- Gather your things and let's go.

469
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:48,323
I'm sorry but I'm unable
to accept your offer.

470
00:34:48,616 --> 00:34:51,993
We feel that such a position
would hardly be appropriate.

471
00:34:52,453 --> 00:34:54,663
You earned a double first
in mathematics.

472
00:34:54,914 --> 00:34:57,624
But sadly, wasn't granted
the opportunity to become a fellow.

473
00:34:58,084 --> 00:34:59,709
You belong at Bletchley.

474
00:35:00,294 --> 00:35:03,880
I'm sorry, but for someone
in my position to live, to...

475
00:35:04,507 --> 00:35:07,759
to work in a radio factory
so far from home,

476
00:35:07,885 --> 00:35:11,179
with all your men, erm, it would be...

477
00:35:12,765 --> 00:35:14,182
indecorous.

478
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:18,854
What in the world does that even mean?

479
00:35:23,651 --> 00:35:27,988
We have a group of young ladies
who tend to all of our clerical tasks.

480
00:35:28,072 --> 00:35:29,906
Assistants, translators.

481
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:32,617
They live, erm, together in town.

482
00:35:32,702 --> 00:35:36,079
Would that be
a more suitable environment?

483
00:35:36,747 --> 00:35:40,542
Hmm. So... So I would be working
amongst these women?

484
00:35:40,793 --> 00:35:42,210
Yes.

485
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:46,715
Wonderful ladies.

486
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:50,218
They even organise social events
at St Martin's church down the road.

487
00:35:50,303 --> 00:35:52,846
Really, the whole thing is quite, er,

488
00:35:53,222 --> 00:35:55,181
um, decorous.

489
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:02,856
Now, you won't have
proper security clearance, of course,

490
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,525
so we'll have to improvise things a bit.

491
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,068
Why are you helping me?

492
00:36:07,153 --> 00:36:10,530
Because there is only one thing that
matters in this entire world right now,

493
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:12,532
do you understand?
And that is breaking Enigma.

494
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:14,326
But... But Mr Turing...

495
00:36:16,454 --> 00:36:17,954
Why are you helping me?

496
00:36:18,956 --> 00:36:20,457
Oh, um...

497
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:25,045
Sometimes it's the very people
who no one imagines anything of

498
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:28,214
who do the things
that no one can imagine.

499
00:36:47,026 --> 00:36:48,485
Sir.

500
00:36:49,028 --> 00:36:52,864
- What this?
- Alan Turing's classified military file.

501
00:36:54,075 --> 00:36:55,784
- Bloody empty.
- Exactly.

502
00:36:56,494 --> 00:36:58,703
- It's an empty manila envelope.
- Yeah.

503
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:02,332
You've cracked the case wide open, then,
haven't you?

504
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:04,793
Alan Turing's war records
aren't just classified,

505
00:37:04,877 --> 00:37:06,336
they're non-existent.

506
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:10,882
That means someone's got rid of them,
erased them, burnt them.

507
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:14,094
And that same person broke
into his house and stole nothing?

508
00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:17,389
Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.

509
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,934
- What, the spies from the papers?
- Soviet spies.

510
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,895
But first they were professors,
weren't they?

511
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:27,440
Radicalised at Cambridge,
then they joined the Communist Party,

512
00:37:27,525 --> 00:37:28,692
then the Foreign Office,

513
00:37:28,776 --> 00:37:30,986
then leaked information to Stalin
during the war.

514
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,571
Now, can you think of anyone else
we know who was at Cambridge,

515
00:37:33,656 --> 00:37:36,908
then took up something murky
and top secret when the war broke out?

516
00:37:37,326 --> 00:37:40,412
You think this Alan Turing
might be a Soviet agent?

517
00:37:41,038 --> 00:37:45,333
I think something very serious
is happening right here under our noses.

518
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,962
Wouldn't you like
to find out what it is?

519
00:38:21,495 --> 00:38:23,997
Welcome, ladies.
If you'd like to follow me.

520
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:29,085
Some people thought
we were at war with the Germans.

521
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,211
Incorrect.

522
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:32,380
We were at war with the clock.

523
00:38:32,548 --> 00:38:34,924
Britain was literally starving to death.

524
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:40,138
The Americans sent over 100,000 tonnes
of food every week

525
00:38:40,514 --> 00:38:43,808
and every week the Germans would
send our desperately needed bread

526
00:38:43,893 --> 00:38:45,518
to the bottom of the ocean.

527
00:38:45,603 --> 00:38:49,105
Our daily failure was announced
at the chimes of midnight.

528
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:52,859
And the sound would haunt
our unwelcome dreams.

529
00:38:53,527 --> 00:38:55,361
Tick, tock.

530
00:38:55,905 --> 00:38:57,113
Tick.

531
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:05,080
Damn it!

532
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:09,584
- What just happened?
- Midnight.

533
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:12,712
All the work we've done today
is useless.

534
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:14,380
Oh, but don't worry, we've a few hours

535
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,841
before tomorrow's messages
start flooding in,

536
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:19,344
then we start all over again.

537
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,765
- From scratch.
- I'm so sick of this.

538
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:26,768
Four hours rewiring
his plugboard matrix.

539
00:39:26,852 --> 00:39:29,354
Three hours yesterday
on his rotor positions.

540
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:32,357
- Don't go over there.
- Look, John, no.

541
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:35,527
If this job wasn't already impossible
before, it bloody well is now.

542
00:39:35,611 --> 00:39:37,028
Hugh, don't.

543
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:47,914
Damn you and your useless machine.

544
00:39:48,874 --> 00:39:52,085
My machine is how we are going to win.

545
00:39:52,294 --> 00:39:53,711
Really?

546
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:55,713
This machine?

547
00:39:56,924 --> 00:39:59,217
Are you talking about
this bloody machine?

548
00:39:59,468 --> 00:40:00,927
- Hugh!
- Hugh, don't! Don't!

549
00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:03,346
- Stop!
- You arrogant bastard.

550
00:40:03,514 --> 00:40:04,973
You could help us.

551
00:40:05,057 --> 00:40:07,308
You could make this go faster
but you won't.

552
00:40:09,436 --> 00:40:10,937
Get off.

553
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,027
He's right, Alan.

554
00:40:20,114 --> 00:40:23,992
There are actual soldiers out there
trying to win an actual war.

555
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:27,704
My brother protects
food convoys in the Navy.

556
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:30,456
My cousins fly RAF patrols.

557
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:35,086
All my friends, they're all making
a difference while we just

558
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:38,882
while away our days producing nothing.

559
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:41,926
Because of you.

560
00:40:43,345 --> 00:40:46,931
My machine will work.

561
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:50,435
Come on, Peter.

562
00:41:30,476 --> 00:41:31,976
Okay.

563
00:42:01,632 --> 00:42:03,716
Joan!

564
00:42:29,702 --> 00:42:32,704
Could you have made a bit more noise?
I'm not quite sure my landlady woke up.

565
00:42:32,788 --> 00:42:34,956
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, uh, look.

566
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:38,543
I think that's the best I can do.
No male visitors after dark.

567
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:43,172
- So, what did you bring me?
- Erm...

568
00:42:43,632 --> 00:42:45,550
- There you go.
- Here.

569
00:42:46,927 --> 00:42:48,636
Some men try flowers, you know.

570
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:53,057
These are actual decrypted Enigma
messages direct from Nazi High Command.

571
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:58,396
"0600 hours, weather today is clear.

572
00:42:58,647 --> 00:43:00,732
"Rain in the evening. Heil Hitler."

573
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,777
Well, clearly that vital piece of
information is going to win us the war.

574
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:06,946
It's the relationship
between the encrypted

575
00:43:07,323 --> 00:43:09,741
and decrypted messages
that interests me.

576
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:13,703
Can we find a clue here
that we can build into Christopher?

577
00:43:13,787 --> 00:43:16,331
- Who's Christopher?
- Oh, he's my machine.

578
00:43:17,249 --> 00:43:18,708
You named him?

579
00:43:19,418 --> 00:43:20,877
Is that a bad name?

580
00:43:22,212 --> 00:43:23,671
No.

581
00:43:24,673 --> 00:43:26,090
No, never mind.

582
00:43:32,723 --> 00:43:34,724
Are you trying to build
your universal machine?

583
00:43:37,144 --> 00:43:38,853
I read your paper at university.

584
00:43:38,937 --> 00:43:41,105
- Is it already being taught?
- No.

585
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:43,733
No. No, I was precocious.

586
00:43:43,817 --> 00:43:47,737
So, you theorised a machine
that could solve any problem?

587
00:43:47,821 --> 00:43:49,989
It didn't just do one thing,
it did everything?

588
00:43:50,074 --> 00:43:52,200
It wasn't just programmable,
it was re-programmable?

589
00:43:52,284 --> 00:43:53,368
Mmm.

590
00:43:53,994 --> 00:43:55,745
Is that your idea behind Christopher?

591
00:43:57,081 --> 00:44:01,250
Human brains can compute large sums
very quickly, even Hugh can do that,

592
00:44:01,335 --> 00:44:03,252
but I want Christopher to be smarter.

593
00:44:04,129 --> 00:44:08,049
To make a calculation
and then to determine what to do next.

594
00:44:09,093 --> 00:44:10,551
Like a person does.

595
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,970
Think of it.

596
00:44:13,263 --> 00:44:14,806
An electrical brain.

597
00:44:15,391 --> 00:44:16,849
A digital computer.

598
00:44:18,102 --> 00:44:19,519
Digital computer?

599
00:44:21,271 --> 00:44:22,772
Hmm.

600
00:44:36,453 --> 00:44:37,912
What's going on?

601
00:44:38,455 --> 00:44:39,872
What's happening?

602
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:42,750
- No, no, no. Don't touch that.
- Stay back.

603
00:44:42,835 --> 00:44:43,960
That's my desk.

604
00:44:45,129 --> 00:44:48,214
Thank goodness. I'd hate to think
we were searching the wrong one.

605
00:44:48,298 --> 00:44:49,841
What are you doing? What's going on?

606
00:44:51,051 --> 00:44:53,219
There is a spy in Bletchley Park.

607
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:55,888
The Navy thinks that one of us
is a Soviet double agent, Alan.

608
00:44:56,473 --> 00:44:57,890
Why?

609
00:44:59,017 --> 00:45:01,602
Our boys intercepted this
on its way to Moscow.

610
00:45:01,812 --> 00:45:03,271
Look familiar?

611
00:45:07,276 --> 00:45:08,693
It's a Beale cipher.

612
00:45:08,777 --> 00:45:11,904
Encrypted with a phrase from a book
or a poem or...

613
00:45:17,578 --> 00:45:19,036
You...

614
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:22,415
You don't seriously think I did this,
do you?

615
00:45:23,709 --> 00:45:25,209
Double agents are such bastards.

616
00:45:26,128 --> 00:45:30,089
Isolated loners.
No attachments to friends or family.

617
00:45:30,257 --> 00:45:31,799
Arrogant.

618
00:45:32,301 --> 00:45:33,885
Know anybody like that?

619
00:45:37,347 --> 00:45:38,806
I...

620
00:45:38,974 --> 00:45:41,476
Hmm. I know you don't like me

621
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,687
but that does not make me a Soviet spy.

622
00:45:45,689 --> 00:45:47,106
Nothing out of the ordinary, sir.

623
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:51,444
Really? Hmm, all right.

624
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,657
The Home Office
may be protecting you now

625
00:45:56,742 --> 00:45:58,868
but sooner or later,
you will make a mistake.

626
00:46:00,287 --> 00:46:02,121
And I needn't bother firing you.

627
00:46:02,456 --> 00:46:04,499
They will hang you for treason.

628
00:46:26,271 --> 00:46:27,730
Hello.

629
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:31,025
I heard about what happened.

630
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:33,361
It's all the girls in Hut 3
can talk about.

631
00:46:35,822 --> 00:46:37,990
I have an idea of what
might cheer you up.

632
00:46:42,496 --> 00:46:44,664
So, because no letter can be
encoded as itself,

633
00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:47,291
there's already a handful of settings
that can be rejected at the outset.

634
00:46:52,756 --> 00:46:54,840
- Is that your team?
- Uh, yes.

635
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:56,384
- Shall we say hello?
- No.

636
00:46:56,468 --> 00:46:57,885
Hello.

637
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,012
I told you not to do that.

638
00:47:01,682 --> 00:47:03,099
Alan.

639
00:47:03,225 --> 00:47:05,643
- Uh, Hugh, hello.
- Didn't know you drank.

640
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,895
He doesn't, really.
He just sort of sips at the foam.

641
00:47:08,021 --> 00:47:09,438
I'll let you
into a little secret, Miss...

642
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,399
- Clarke.
- Miss Clarke.

643
00:47:11,483 --> 00:47:13,901
- Please.
- Foam's my favourite part, too.

644
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,612
- Is it really?
- Come and join us for a drink.

645
00:47:16,697 --> 00:47:19,323
- We'll be there in a moment.
- Miss Clarke.

646
00:47:26,081 --> 00:47:27,415
Well, he likes you.

647
00:47:27,499 --> 00:47:29,000
- Yes.
- You, uh...

648
00:47:30,502 --> 00:47:32,795
You got him to like you.

649
00:47:34,089 --> 00:47:35,756
- Yes.
- Why?

650
00:47:36,717 --> 00:47:38,217
Because I'm a woman in a man's job

651
00:47:38,302 --> 00:47:40,511
and I don't have the luxury
of being an arse.

652
00:47:41,972 --> 00:47:44,890
Alan, it doesn't matter
how smart you are,

653
00:47:45,267 --> 00:47:47,059
Enigma is always smarter.

654
00:47:48,395 --> 00:47:50,980
If you really want to solve your puzzle,

655
00:47:51,231 --> 00:47:53,190
then you're going to need
all the help you can get

656
00:47:53,275 --> 00:47:57,236
and they are not going to help you
if they do not like you.

657
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:06,245
What are those?

658
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,831
- Apples.
- No.

659
00:48:08,915 --> 00:48:11,375
Oh, they really are. Um, I've...

660
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,003
Well, Miss Clarke...
Joan, actually, um,

661
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:17,048
said that it would be nice

662
00:48:17,132 --> 00:48:19,342
if I was to bring you all something.

663
00:48:19,426 --> 00:48:21,260
So here we are.

664
00:48:21,345 --> 00:48:23,137
- Thank you.
- I like apples.

665
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:25,890
My best to Miss Clarke.

666
00:48:25,974 --> 00:48:30,269
Uh, there are two people in a wood
and, um, they run into a bear.

667
00:48:30,687 --> 00:48:32,980
The first person gets down
on his knees to pray.

668
00:48:33,065 --> 00:48:34,940
The second person
starts lacing up his boots.

669
00:48:35,025 --> 00:48:36,859
The first person asks the second person,

670
00:48:36,943 --> 00:48:40,112
"My dear friend, what are you doing?
You can't outrun a bear."

671
00:48:40,197 --> 00:48:41,864
To which the second person responds,

672
00:48:41,948 --> 00:48:45,534
"I don't have to,
I only have to outrun you."

673
00:48:56,296 --> 00:48:59,298
I'll be with Christopher
if anyone needs me.

674
00:48:59,383 --> 00:49:03,803
If we assume that the
square root of two is a rational number,

675
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:09,600
then we can say that
the square root of two is A over B,

676
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:13,270
where A and B are whole numbers

677
00:49:13,897 --> 00:49:16,232
and B is not zero.

678
00:49:16,525 --> 00:49:19,694
- Mr Turing, passing notes, are we?
- No, sir.

679
00:49:25,951 --> 00:49:29,537
Only Turing would pass notes
written in gibberish.

680
00:49:34,793 --> 00:49:36,252
All right, gentlemen.

681
00:49:36,336 --> 00:49:38,963
Do not forget your algebra
over the break.

682
00:49:40,132 --> 00:49:42,049
Have a pleasant holiday.

683
00:49:42,134 --> 00:49:45,469
And we'll resume your irrationals
when you return.

684
00:50:17,294 --> 00:50:18,627
Mmm.

685
00:50:20,797 --> 00:50:23,632
But Euler's Theorem
gives you that immediately.

686
00:50:23,717 --> 00:50:25,384
Erm...

687
00:50:34,728 --> 00:50:36,604
Here, look at this.

688
00:50:38,982 --> 00:50:41,525
If you run the wires across
the plugboard matrix diagonally,

689
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:44,320
it will eliminate rotor positions
500 times faster.

690
00:50:45,739 --> 00:50:49,658
That's, uh,
actually not an entirely terrible idea.

691
00:50:52,329 --> 00:50:53,954
I think that was Alan for "thank you".

692
00:50:57,793 --> 00:51:01,003
- That's my sandwich.
- You don't like sandwiches.

693
00:51:15,685 --> 00:51:17,102
Are you nervous?

694
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,627
What happens now?

695
00:51:43,129 --> 00:51:46,507
Well, it should work out
the day's Enigma settings.

696
00:52:01,439 --> 00:52:02,898
How long?

697
00:52:20,876 --> 00:52:23,836
The German Army
has fanned out across Europe,

698
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,882
from Poland to Serbia,
Lithuania to Denmark, Norway to France.

699
00:52:27,966 --> 00:52:32,011
The Nazi flag now flies from more
than two dozen national capitals.

700
00:52:32,095 --> 00:52:36,015
Their campaign mounts in fury
as a free Europe crumbles.

701
00:53:17,057 --> 00:53:18,933
Oh, it's still going.

702
00:53:19,017 --> 00:53:20,976
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Margaret.

703
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:24,396
Gears keep spinning on and on.
Rotors on and on.

704
00:53:25,106 --> 00:53:26,523
It's endless.

705
00:53:27,317 --> 00:53:30,903
- With no result in sight?
- No.

706
00:53:44,376 --> 00:53:45,751
Turing.

707
00:53:57,806 --> 00:53:59,723
Turing, open the bloody door.

708
00:54:00,141 --> 00:54:01,558
No. No.

709
00:54:03,603 --> 00:54:05,521
Open the door or we'll break it down.

710
00:54:05,605 --> 00:54:07,398
I can't let you in.

711
00:54:07,482 --> 00:54:09,066
I cannot let you interfere.

712
00:54:09,567 --> 00:54:10,985
Go on, then.

713
00:54:18,493 --> 00:54:19,910
Turn that thing off!

714
00:54:20,412 --> 00:54:22,246
No. Don't, please.

715
00:54:22,497 --> 00:54:24,415
Please, please, please!

716
00:54:24,499 --> 00:54:27,251
No. No, don't! No, no!

717
00:54:31,256 --> 00:54:35,759
Well, then, it seems that your great
big expensive machine doesn't work.

718
00:54:37,178 --> 00:54:38,595
It does.

719
00:54:39,097 --> 00:54:42,266
Wonderful.
So you've broken Enigma, then?

720
00:54:42,934 --> 00:54:44,435
It was just...

721
00:54:45,353 --> 00:54:47,271
Still working.

722
00:54:48,523 --> 00:54:50,441
This is my associate
from the Home Office.

723
00:54:51,151 --> 00:54:54,445
You see,
£100,000 is rather a lot of money

724
00:54:54,529 --> 00:54:56,947
and he's here to see
what you have to show for it.

725
00:54:57,032 --> 00:55:00,409
You will never understand

726
00:55:00,493 --> 00:55:03,996
the importance of what
I am creating here!

727
00:55:05,707 --> 00:55:08,292
Have you decrypted any German messages?

728
00:55:09,169 --> 00:55:10,669
A single one?

729
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:14,673
Can you point to anything at all
that you've achieved?

730
00:55:15,383 --> 00:55:16,967
Hmm.

731
00:55:17,052 --> 00:55:20,846
Your funding is up
and our patience has expired.

732
00:55:21,347 --> 00:55:25,559
It's with such great pleasure
that I am finally able to say this.

733
00:55:25,685 --> 00:55:27,853
Alan Turing, you're fired.

734
00:55:29,314 --> 00:55:31,648
Please escort Mr Turing
from the premises.

735
00:55:33,026 --> 00:55:34,526
No.

736
00:55:36,154 --> 00:55:37,863
I beg your pardon?

737
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:45,162
If you fire Alan,

738
00:55:46,372 --> 00:55:48,499
well, then, you'll have to fire me, too.

739
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,417
What on earth are you saying?

740
00:55:51,377 --> 00:55:53,003
Trust me when I tell you there is no one

741
00:55:53,088 --> 00:55:55,422
who would rather say this
less than I do but...

742
00:55:57,258 --> 00:56:00,344
he's right. Alan is right.

743
00:56:00,512 --> 00:56:04,598
His machine can work and it's probably
the best chance that we've got.

744
00:56:05,517 --> 00:56:07,184
God, it's beyond belief.

745
00:56:07,936 --> 00:56:11,188
If you fire them,
you'll have to fire me, too.

746
00:56:11,898 --> 00:56:13,398
And me.

747
00:56:13,691 --> 00:56:16,276
We're the best
cryptographic minds in Britain.

748
00:56:17,028 --> 00:56:18,445
Are you going to fire us all?

749
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:21,865
Commander, at least
give us some more time.

750
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,702
Six months. And if the machine doesn't
produce any results that we need,

751
00:56:25,787 --> 00:56:28,539
then we'll go back to doing things
the old way. How about that?

752
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,047
One month.

753
00:56:37,382 --> 00:56:40,259
And then so help me God,
you're all gone.

754
00:56:41,386 --> 00:56:42,928
Oh, leave him.

755
00:56:50,979 --> 00:56:54,148
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

756
00:56:55,733 --> 00:56:57,985
Oh, and, Alan, your machine,

757
00:57:01,156 --> 00:57:02,656
it had better bloody work.

758
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:12,166
Hugh...

759
00:57:13,126 --> 00:57:14,585
I swear,

760
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,254
I'm not a spy.

761
00:57:18,965 --> 00:57:20,966
Oh, for God's sake,
of course you're not a bloody spy.

762
00:57:21,759 --> 00:57:24,595
- What?
- Denniston gave me the Beale cipher

763
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:27,097
and guess what? I cracked it.

764
00:57:27,932 --> 00:57:31,101
"Ask, and it shall be given to you;
seek and ye shall find."

765
00:57:31,186 --> 00:57:33,103
Matthew 7:7. That was the key.

766
00:57:34,856 --> 00:57:37,107
Far too simple for the likes of you.

767
00:57:39,027 --> 00:57:40,861
Pity Denniston disagrees.

768
00:57:51,497 --> 00:57:52,956
Come in.

769
00:57:55,627 --> 00:57:57,794
Sir, I think I've got Turing.

770
00:57:58,838 --> 00:58:02,674
I tailed him to a pub last night where
he met a bloke. Exchanged an envelope.

771
00:58:03,468 --> 00:58:06,803
So I follow this other fella,
pick him up, gave him a good shake.

772
00:58:08,389 --> 00:58:11,808
- He's a poofter. He confessed.
- What?

773
00:58:12,644 --> 00:58:15,020
The man admitted it. Arnold Murray.

774
00:58:15,146 --> 00:58:17,481
Hangs around that pub,
men pay him for a go.

775
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:20,234
Turing's one of the men that paid.

776
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:22,152
Only Mr Murray here
then has the bright idea

777
00:58:22,237 --> 00:58:24,821
of robbing Turing's house after,
with a friend.

778
00:58:25,531 --> 00:58:27,032
That's what Turing's hiding.

779
00:58:27,533 --> 00:58:29,534
Well, he's a poof, not a spy.

780
00:58:29,661 --> 00:58:31,078
- No.
- What's the matter?

781
00:58:31,496 --> 00:58:33,580
We can charge a university professor
with indecency.

782
00:58:33,665 --> 00:58:36,792
No, this is... It's bloody rubbish.
Turing's up to something important.

783
00:58:36,876 --> 00:58:39,086
He's committed a crime
and he's broken the law.

784
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:40,587
And with a bloke.

785
00:58:40,672 --> 00:58:42,297
Jesus Christ, it's bloody disgusting.

786
00:58:42,382 --> 00:58:44,174
This isn't the investigation
I was conducting.

787
00:58:44,926 --> 00:58:46,343
Bring him in.

788
00:58:46,761 --> 00:58:48,220
Wait.

789
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:52,432
Let me interrogate him. Please.
Give me half an hour alone

790
00:58:52,517 --> 00:58:55,060
and then I swear, I'll spend
the next month running errands

791
00:58:55,186 --> 00:58:57,396
on as many rubbish cases as you like.

792
00:58:58,189 --> 00:58:59,356
Fine.

793
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,025
Now, will someone get me a warrant
for the arrest of Alan Turing?

794
00:59:19,043 --> 00:59:20,168
Alan?

795
00:59:20,253 --> 00:59:22,754
Christopher's simply not
moving fast enough.

796
00:59:23,464 --> 00:59:25,966
- We should talk.
- And even with the diagonal board,

797
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:28,302
he's still not eliminating settings
as quickly as we need him to...

798
00:59:28,386 --> 00:59:30,762
- I'm leaving.
- But you've just walked in.

799
00:59:31,431 --> 00:59:34,391
No. No, Bletchley.

800
00:59:35,059 --> 00:59:36,977
- What?
- It's my parents.

801
00:59:37,812 --> 00:59:40,731
I'm 25, I'm unmarried,
I'm living alone and they want me home.

802
00:59:41,274 --> 00:59:43,400
That's just ridiculous.

803
00:59:43,943 --> 00:59:45,402
That's my parents.

804
00:59:45,611 --> 00:59:48,739
You... You can't leave. I won't let you.

805
00:59:49,407 --> 00:59:50,782
"I'll miss you."

806
00:59:50,908 --> 00:59:53,035
That's what a normal person
might say in this situation.

807
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,120
I don't care what is normal.

808
00:59:55,246 --> 00:59:56,913
What am I supposed to do, Alan?

809
00:59:59,083 --> 01:00:02,586
I... I will not give up my parents.

810
01:00:03,421 --> 01:00:04,421
You...

811
01:00:04,505 --> 01:00:08,425
You have an opportunity here
to make some actual use of your life.

812
01:00:08,843 --> 01:00:10,761
And end up like you? No, thanks.

813
01:00:12,096 --> 01:00:16,600
I'm sorry you're lonely
but Enigma will not save you.

814
01:00:17,101 --> 01:00:19,519
Can you decipher that,
you fragile narcissist?

815
01:00:19,604 --> 01:00:22,439
Or would you like me to go and fetch
your precious Christopher to help?

816
01:00:28,363 --> 01:00:29,821
I'm sorry.

817
01:00:36,454 --> 01:00:39,539
I want you...
I want you to stay because I like you.

818
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:42,667
I like talking to you.

819
01:00:43,961 --> 01:00:45,629
I like talking to you, too, Alan.

820
01:00:51,469 --> 01:00:54,971
And what if you weren't alone?
What if you had a husband?

821
01:00:56,849 --> 01:00:58,308
Do you have one in mind?

822
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,560
I do.

823
01:01:01,229 --> 01:01:02,729
Hugh?

824
01:01:03,314 --> 01:01:04,731
Hugh's terribly attractive,
I'll give you that,

825
01:01:04,816 --> 01:01:07,067
but I don't really think
he's the marrying kind.

826
01:01:07,151 --> 01:01:09,986
No, I... I wasn't thinking of Hugh.

827
01:01:10,154 --> 01:01:13,031
Or Peter. Peter's so quiet.

828
01:01:18,663 --> 01:01:20,080
Oh, my God.

829
01:01:20,915 --> 01:01:23,667
- But this makes sense.
- Did you just propose to me?

830
01:01:24,001 --> 01:01:26,336
Well, it is the logical thing to do.

831
01:01:26,671 --> 01:01:27,671
This is ridiculous.

832
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:28,839
This is your parents.

833
01:01:28,923 --> 01:01:31,425
I can't believe
that this is happening.

834
01:01:36,055 --> 01:01:37,514
Joan...

835
01:01:38,891 --> 01:01:40,559
Is your middle name
Caroline or Catherine?

836
01:01:40,685 --> 01:01:41,685
Elizabeth.

837
01:01:41,769 --> 01:01:45,188
Erm, Joan Elizabeth Clarke, erm...

838
01:01:48,609 --> 01:01:50,402
will you marry me?

839
01:01:59,412 --> 01:02:01,037
It's beautiful.

840
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:04,207
Well, I know it isn't ordinary but...

841
01:02:06,461 --> 01:02:07,961
whoever loved ordinary?

842
01:02:08,463 --> 01:02:10,672
She had it in both hands.

843
01:02:10,756 --> 01:02:13,717
And she looked up at me
with her doe eyes and said,

844
01:02:13,801 --> 01:02:15,844
"Am I supposed to put that in my mouth?"

845
01:02:15,928 --> 01:02:19,139
And I said,
"Yes, you know, the French way."

846
01:02:20,641 --> 01:02:23,310
So she pops it in,
clamps her lips around it,

847
01:02:23,895 --> 01:02:26,396
and starts humming
the bloody Marseillaise.

848
01:02:30,485 --> 01:02:32,110
- Come and have a dance.
- No, no, no, no.

849
01:02:32,236 --> 01:02:33,737
You can dance with your fiancé
any time you like.

850
01:02:33,821 --> 01:02:35,614
Right now, this moment...

851
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:36,698
...my turn.

852
01:03:05,102 --> 01:03:06,770
What's the matter?

853
01:03:12,276 --> 01:03:13,944
What if...

854
01:03:19,784 --> 01:03:24,829
What if I don't fancy being with Joan
in that way?

855
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:29,876
Because you're a homosexual?

856
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,048
I suspected.

857
01:03:36,467 --> 01:03:40,720
Well, should I tell her
that I've had affairs with men?

858
01:03:42,139 --> 01:03:46,142
You know, in my admittedly
limited experience,

859
01:03:46,644 --> 01:03:50,647
women tend to be a bit touchy about
accidentally marrying homosexuals.

860
01:03:51,899 --> 01:03:55,318
Perhaps not spreading this information
about might be in your best interest.

861
01:03:58,823 --> 01:04:01,157
I care for her, I truly do. I...

862
01:04:05,162 --> 01:04:08,415
I... I just don't know if I can, erm...

863
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:12,002
- pretend about...
- You can't tell anyone, Alan.

864
01:04:13,045 --> 01:04:14,504
It's illegal.

865
01:04:15,673 --> 01:04:18,758
And Denniston is looking
for any excuse he can to put you away.

866
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:21,845
- I know.
- This has to stay a secret.

867
01:04:22,346 --> 01:04:23,847
Come on, it's your turn.

868
01:04:24,265 --> 01:04:25,682
Ah, okay.

869
01:05:10,895 --> 01:05:13,146
It's a sport for girls!

870
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:15,565
It's not a sport for girls!

871
01:05:48,641 --> 01:05:51,476
- Cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

872
01:06:05,658 --> 01:06:07,117
Mr Turing, can I tell you a secret?

873
01:06:08,202 --> 01:06:09,661
I'm quite good with those.

874
01:06:09,954 --> 01:06:11,496
I'm here to help you.

875
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:15,625
Oh, clearly.

876
01:06:23,008 --> 01:06:24,676
Can machines think?

877
01:06:25,136 --> 01:06:28,138
Oh, so you've read some
of my published works?

878
01:06:28,389 --> 01:06:29,973
What makes you say that?

879
01:06:30,808 --> 01:06:33,309
Well, because I'm sitting
in a police station

880
01:06:33,394 --> 01:06:35,895
accused of entreating
a young man to touch my penis

881
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:39,733
and you just asked me
if machines can think.

882
01:06:41,569 --> 01:06:43,153
Well, can they?

883
01:06:44,739 --> 01:06:48,158
Could machines ever think
as human beings do?

884
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,910
Most people say not.

885
01:06:51,495 --> 01:06:53,163
You're not most people.

886
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:59,043
Well, the problem is
you're asking a stupid question.

887
01:07:00,045 --> 01:07:01,463
I am?

888
01:07:01,547 --> 01:07:05,258
Of course machines
can't think as people do.

889
01:07:06,552 --> 01:07:09,596
A machine is different from a person.

890
01:07:11,849 --> 01:07:13,850
Hence they think differently.

891
01:07:17,521 --> 01:07:19,898
The interesting question is
just because something,

892
01:07:20,024 --> 01:07:22,066
er, thinks differently from you,

893
01:07:22,193 --> 01:07:24,736
does that mean it's not thinking?

894
01:07:26,864 --> 01:07:30,867
Well, we allow for humans to have
such divergences from one another.

895
01:07:34,538 --> 01:07:36,790
You like strawberries.
I hate ice-skating.

896
01:07:36,874 --> 01:07:39,667
You cry at sad films.

897
01:07:39,752 --> 01:07:41,920
I am allergic to pollen.

898
01:07:43,714 --> 01:07:46,966
What is the point
of different tastes, different...

899
01:07:48,135 --> 01:07:51,513
...preferences if not to say
that our brains work differently,

900
01:07:51,597 --> 01:07:53,807
that we think differently?

901
01:07:56,143 --> 01:07:58,061
And if we can say
that about one another,

902
01:07:58,145 --> 01:08:01,189
then why can't we say
the same thing for brains

903
01:08:01,273 --> 01:08:04,067
built of copper and wire, steel?

904
01:08:05,402 --> 01:08:10,281
And that's this big paper you wrote?
What's it called?

905
01:08:11,575 --> 01:08:13,159
The Imitation Game.

906
01:08:13,244 --> 01:08:15,578
Right, that's... That's what it's about?

907
01:08:21,252 --> 01:08:22,627
Would you like to play?

908
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:25,797
- Play?
- It's a game.

909
01:08:25,923 --> 01:08:27,340
A test of sorts.

910
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:33,596
For determining whether something
is a... a machine or a human being.

911
01:08:34,265 --> 01:08:37,767
- How do I play?
- Well, there's a judge and a subject.

912
01:08:38,769 --> 01:08:42,605
And the judge asks questions
and depending on the subject's answers,

913
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:47,944
determines who he is talking with, er,
what he is talking with and, um,

914
01:08:49,864 --> 01:08:52,365
all you have to do
is ask me a question.

915
01:08:58,205 --> 01:08:59,873
What did you do during the war?

916
01:08:59,957 --> 01:09:02,125
I worked in a radio factory.

917
01:09:04,461 --> 01:09:06,504
What did you really do during the war?

918
01:09:10,968 --> 01:09:12,802
Are you paying attention?

919
01:09:31,989 --> 01:09:33,406
Damn it!

920
01:09:40,915 --> 01:09:43,583
We're soon out of time. Our month.

921
01:09:44,835 --> 01:09:46,419
So that's it, then, is it?

922
01:09:46,503 --> 01:09:48,796
Oh, the trouble is it doesn't matter
how much we improve it.

923
01:09:48,881 --> 01:09:50,423
The machine's never
going to be able to process

924
01:09:50,507 --> 01:09:52,800
159 million million million
possibilities in time.

925
01:09:52,885 --> 01:09:54,510
It's just bloody hopeless.

926
01:09:55,512 --> 01:09:57,221
It's searching. It's just...

927
01:09:58,724 --> 01:10:00,892
It doesn't know what it's searching for.

928
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,353
If we knew what the messages
were going to say...

929
01:10:03,437 --> 01:10:04,979
If we knew what the messages
were going to say,

930
01:10:05,064 --> 01:10:06,522
we wouldn't have to decrypt them at all.

931
01:10:12,112 --> 01:10:13,529
Who's Alan's friend?

932
01:10:14,531 --> 01:10:16,866
Hugh? He's a bit of a cad, actually.

933
01:10:17,785 --> 01:10:19,202
So my type, then?

934
01:10:19,286 --> 01:10:21,371
- Well, I'll introduce you.
- No...

935
01:10:22,081 --> 01:10:23,498
He'll come over.

936
01:10:23,582 --> 01:10:25,416
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

937
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:28,378
I smiled at him 15 minutes ago
and haven't looked back since.

938
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:32,715
- Who's that with Joan?
- Mmm?

939
01:10:33,884 --> 01:10:36,094
Er, Helen. Works with her.

940
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:37,679
She's really pretty.

941
01:10:37,763 --> 01:10:39,222
She wants me to come over.

942
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,933
What? How... How on earth
can you know that?

943
01:10:42,059 --> 01:10:44,894
She smiled at me a while back
and she hasn't looked again since.

944
01:10:51,235 --> 01:10:52,610
And got him.

945
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:56,406
Now, why is this, that when
I was single I found it very boring,

946
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:59,075
but now that I'm engaged,
I just find it dreadfully fun?

947
01:11:01,829 --> 01:11:03,246
Bingo, she's in.

948
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:04,956
Alan, introduce us.

949
01:11:05,082 --> 01:11:06,958
What?  Why me?

950
01:11:09,253 --> 01:11:10,878
Because there's nothing
like a friend's engagement

951
01:11:10,963 --> 01:11:13,047
to make a woman want to do
something she'll later regret

952
01:11:13,132 --> 01:11:16,092
with the fiancé's
better-looking chum. Let's go.

953
01:11:21,598 --> 01:11:24,684
Half a crown says
Alan bollockses this up entirely.

954
01:11:24,768 --> 01:11:26,227
No bet.

955
01:11:26,311 --> 01:11:28,479
- Alan Turing has a theory.
- He has many.

956
01:11:29,273 --> 01:11:31,482
He believes that the regulations
against men and women

957
01:11:31,608 --> 01:11:34,027
working side by side are sound

958
01:11:34,111 --> 01:11:36,571
because such proximity
will necessarily lead to romance.

959
01:11:36,655 --> 01:11:39,991
- Er, what? No, I don't. I...
- However, I disagree.

960
01:11:40,117 --> 01:11:41,617
- You do?
- Yeah.

961
01:11:41,702 --> 01:11:44,078
I think that if I were working
beside a woman all day long,

962
01:11:44,163 --> 01:11:46,873
I could appreciate
her abilities and intellect

963
01:11:46,957 --> 01:11:48,624
without taking her to bed.

964
01:11:50,294 --> 01:11:51,669
I'm sorry, have we met?

965
01:11:52,296 --> 01:11:54,380
I don't recall.
But let's assume we haven't.

966
01:11:54,465 --> 01:11:56,132
Helen Stewart, Hugh Alexander.

967
01:11:56,216 --> 01:11:58,092
So who do you agree with?
Alan or myself?

968
01:11:58,177 --> 01:11:59,802
Well, Alan, of course.

969
01:12:00,637 --> 01:12:02,930
I'm very flattered really, but I...
I don't think that...

970
01:12:03,015 --> 01:12:04,557
Rubbish.

971
01:12:04,641 --> 01:12:06,934
Well, I work beside a man every day

972
01:12:07,019 --> 01:12:09,270
and I can't help but have developed
a bit of a crush on him.

973
01:12:09,354 --> 01:12:11,230
Well, who is this man?
So I can kick his arse.

974
01:12:11,315 --> 01:12:13,232
Oh, there's no need to worry,
it's been chaste.

975
01:12:13,317 --> 01:12:16,235
We've never even met. He's a German.

976
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,446
Now I really want to kill him.

977
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:22,325
Er... How... How do you mean
you work alongside a German?

978
01:12:23,035 --> 01:12:26,454
Well, each of us intercepts messages
from a specific German radio tower.

979
01:12:26,538 --> 01:12:28,039
So we have a counterpart
on the other side

980
01:12:28,165 --> 01:12:29,582
who's tip-tapping out the messages.

981
01:12:29,666 --> 01:12:31,334
Everyone types a touch differently,

982
01:12:31,418 --> 01:12:33,544
so you get to know
the rhythm of your counterpart.

983
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:35,421
It's strangely intimate.

984
01:12:35,506 --> 01:12:37,381
I feel as if I know him so well.

985
01:12:37,508 --> 01:12:38,800
It's a pity he has a girlfriend

986
01:12:38,884 --> 01:12:41,427
but that's why I disagree
with you, Mr Alexander,

987
01:12:41,595 --> 01:12:43,429
because I'm in love
with a co-worker of sorts

988
01:12:43,514 --> 01:12:44,931
and we've never even met.

989
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:48,101
Well, allow me to buy you another pint
and I'll tell you why you're wrong.

990
01:12:48,852 --> 01:12:50,228
Let's.

991
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:52,313
Excellent.

992
01:12:54,691 --> 01:12:56,234
Thanks.

993
01:12:56,693 --> 01:13:00,238
Erm... Pints and a sloe gin.

994
01:13:03,367 --> 01:13:05,660
In case you were wondering,
that's what flirting looks like.

995
01:13:05,744 --> 01:13:07,203
Helen!

996
01:13:08,539 --> 01:13:10,581
- Alan!
- Yes, Alan?

997
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:14,335
Why do you think your German
counterpart has a girlfriend?

998
01:13:14,419 --> 01:13:15,920
It's just a stupid joke.
Don't worry about it.

999
01:13:16,046 --> 01:13:17,547
No, no, no, no, no. Tell me.

1000
01:13:19,049 --> 01:13:21,259
Well, each of his messages
begins with the same five letters.

1001
01:13:21,385 --> 01:13:23,427
C-I-L-L-Y.

1002
01:13:23,887 --> 01:13:26,222
So I suspect that Cilly
must be the name of his amore.

1003
01:13:26,306 --> 01:13:28,432
But that's impossible.
The Germans are instructed to use

1004
01:13:28,559 --> 01:13:30,601
five random letters
at the start of every message.

1005
01:13:30,727 --> 01:13:32,311
Well, this bloke doesn't.

1006
01:13:32,813 --> 01:13:34,981
Love will make a man
do strange things, I suppose.

1007
01:13:35,566 --> 01:13:37,150
In this case,

1008
01:13:37,234 --> 01:13:39,110
love just lost Germany
the whole bloody war!

1009
01:13:39,945 --> 01:13:41,821
- Oh!
- Go, Peter.

1010
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:45,116
Sorry.

1011
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:48,828
Alan!

1012
01:13:48,912 --> 01:13:51,581
Alan!

1013
01:13:51,665 --> 01:13:53,666
- Whoa, whoa!
- Stop!

1014
01:13:55,252 --> 01:13:56,919
- No, no, no...
- Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1015
01:13:58,589 --> 01:14:01,841
Hugh Alexander. John Cairncross.
Peter bloody Hilton.

1016
01:14:02,092 --> 01:14:03,843
Alan?

1017
01:14:04,011 --> 01:14:05,469
What...

1018
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:10,433
What... What if...

1019
01:14:10,517 --> 01:14:14,937
What if Christopher doesn't have to
search through all of the settings?

1020
01:14:15,147 --> 01:14:17,523
What if he only has to search through

1021
01:14:17,608 --> 01:14:21,027
ones that produce words we already
know will be in the message?

1022
01:14:21,111 --> 01:14:23,946
- Repeated words. Predictable words.
- Exactly.

1023
01:14:26,783 --> 01:14:28,367
Look. Look, like this one.

1024
01:14:28,452 --> 01:14:30,953
"0600 hours. Weather today is clear.
Rain in the evening.

1025
01:14:31,038 --> 01:14:32,455
"Heil Hitler."

1026
01:14:34,124 --> 01:14:35,625
Oh, that's it.

1027
01:14:35,751 --> 01:14:37,126
Exactly.

1028
01:14:37,252 --> 01:14:40,463
They send a weather report
every day at 6:00 a.m.

1029
01:14:41,048 --> 01:14:42,798
So that's... That's three words we...

1030
01:14:42,883 --> 01:14:45,134
we know will be
in every 6:00 a.m. message.

1031
01:14:45,219 --> 01:14:47,887
Er, "weather", obviously and...

1032
01:14:47,971 --> 01:14:50,306
- Heil bloody Hitler?
- Heil bloody Hitler!

1033
01:14:51,767 --> 01:14:53,434
Here's the 6:00 message
from this morning.

1034
01:15:00,817 --> 01:15:03,486
Hugh, the, er, the right-hand
letter wheels. Set them to...

1035
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:04,987
Yes, yes, I know.
"Weather" and "Hitler".

1036
01:15:05,072 --> 01:15:06,489
- Peter, John.
- Yes.

1037
01:15:06,573 --> 01:15:08,908
Run voltages through those letters,
through the back scramblers.

1038
01:15:08,992 --> 01:15:10,493
- So we'll use the loops?
- Yes.

1039
01:15:10,619 --> 01:15:12,662
Joan, what was the last
6:00 a.m. message?

1040
01:15:12,746 --> 01:15:14,330
- L.
- L.

Q.

1045
01:15:25,926 --> 01:15:27,343
Done.

1046
01:15:44,695 --> 01:15:47,029
Come on. Come on, Christopher.

1047
01:16:03,672 --> 01:16:05,047
Oh, my God.

1048
01:16:12,055 --> 01:16:13,556
What... What happened?

1049
01:16:15,642 --> 01:16:17,310
- Did it work?
- Alan?

1050
01:16:17,394 --> 01:16:19,437
Alan! Alan!

1051
01:16:22,482 --> 01:16:23,899
I need a new message.

1052
01:16:23,984 --> 01:16:25,401
The latest intercept.

1053
01:16:29,656 --> 01:16:31,073
Thanks.

1054
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:33,868
E...

1055
01:16:35,162 --> 01:16:37,079
O... T.

1056
01:16:37,164 --> 01:16:38,331

01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:10,196
"and aufpunkt one degree west."

1075
01:17:11,698 --> 01:17:13,115
Heil Hitler.

1076
01:17:18,288 --> 01:17:21,874
Turns out that's the only German
you need to know to break Enigma.

1077
01:17:29,883 --> 01:17:31,300
Yes!

1078
01:17:49,986 --> 01:17:51,487
Come here.

R.

1092
01:18:51,715 --> 01:18:53,466
My God, you did it.

1093
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:57,887
You just defeated Nazism
with a crossword puzzle.

1094
01:18:57,971 --> 01:18:59,388
There are five people
in the world

1095
01:18:59,473 --> 01:19:01,015
who know the position
of every ship in the Atlantic.

1096
01:19:01,975 --> 01:19:04,477
- They're all in this room.
- Oh, good God.

1097
01:19:04,561 --> 01:19:07,396
Oh, I don't think even He has
the power that we do right now.

1098
01:19:07,522 --> 01:19:10,524
No, there's going to be an attack
on a British passenger convoy.

1099
01:19:11,234 --> 01:19:12,985
- Right there.
- Oh, God, you're right.

1100
01:19:13,069 --> 01:19:15,321
All those U-boats
are only 20, 30 minutes away.

1101
01:19:15,405 --> 01:19:17,656
Civilians. Hundreds of them.
We can save their lives.

1102
01:19:17,741 --> 01:19:19,158
I'll phone Denniston's office

1103
01:19:19,242 --> 01:19:20,659
- so that he can alert the Admiralty.
- No.

1104
01:19:20,744 --> 01:19:21,911
Do you think there's enough time
to save them?

1105
01:19:21,995 --> 01:19:23,662
There should be if we can get
a message to that convoy.

1106
01:19:23,747 --> 01:19:25,498
Commander Denniston's office, please.
It's urgent.

1107
01:19:25,582 --> 01:19:28,000
- No.
- What the hell are you doing?

1108
01:19:28,084 --> 01:19:29,835
You... You... You can't call Denniston.

1109
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,087
You... You can't tell him
about the attack.

1110
01:19:32,172 --> 01:19:33,589
What are you talking about?

1111
01:19:33,673 --> 01:19:35,341
We can have air support
over that convoy in 10 minutes.

1112
01:19:35,425 --> 01:19:37,927
- Let the U-boat sink the convoy.
- Look, it's been a big day,

1113
01:19:38,053 --> 01:19:39,845
maybe you're suffering
from a bit of shock...

1114
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:41,847
- We don't have time for this.
- No!

1115
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:45,935
- That's enough! That's enough!
- Stop, Hugh!

1116
01:19:46,061 --> 01:19:47,436
John, the attack is in minutes.

1117
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:50,689
Yes, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1118
01:19:51,191 --> 01:19:52,608
I'm fine.

1119
01:19:54,069 --> 01:19:56,028
Do you know why
people like violence, Hugh?

1120
01:19:57,781 --> 01:19:59,907
It's because it feels good.

1121
01:20:01,409 --> 01:20:05,704
Sometimes we can't do what feels good.
We have to do what is logical.

1122
01:20:06,289 --> 01:20:07,456
What's logical?

1123
01:20:08,124 --> 01:20:11,126
Hardest time to lie to somebody
is when they're expecting to be lied to.

1124
01:20:11,795 --> 01:20:14,129
- Oh, God.
- What?

1125
01:20:14,256 --> 01:20:17,299
If someone's waiting for a lie,
you can't just, er, give them one.

1126
01:20:18,969 --> 01:20:20,636
Oh, damn it, Alan's right.

1127
01:20:21,638 --> 01:20:23,055
What?

1128
01:20:23,139 --> 01:20:26,976
What would the Germans think
if we destroy their U-boats?

1129
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:28,727
Nothing. They'll be dead.

1130
01:20:28,812 --> 01:20:32,231
No. No, you can't be right.

1131
01:20:32,315 --> 01:20:35,568
So our convoy suddenly veers off course.

1132
01:20:36,611 --> 01:20:38,404
A squadron of RAF bombers

1133
01:20:38,488 --> 01:20:41,991
miraculously descends on
the coordinates of the U-boats.

1134
01:20:43,159 --> 01:20:45,911
What will the Germans think?

1135
01:20:48,248 --> 01:20:51,500
The Germans will know
that we have broken Enigma.

1136
01:20:52,002 --> 01:20:55,588
They'll stop all radio
communications by midday

1137
01:20:55,672 --> 01:20:58,090
and they'll have changed
the design of Enigma by the weekend.

1138
01:20:58,174 --> 01:20:59,633
Yes.

1139
01:21:00,969 --> 01:21:02,428
Two years' work.

1140
01:21:03,263 --> 01:21:06,265
Everything that we've done here,
it will all be for nothing.

1141
01:21:07,767 --> 01:21:09,852
There are
500 civilians in that convoy.

1142
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:12,479
Women, children.

1143
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:15,608
We're about to let them die.

1144
01:21:15,692 --> 01:21:19,278
Our job is not to save
one passenger convoy,

1145
01:21:19,362 --> 01:21:21,280
it is to win the war.

1146
01:21:21,364 --> 01:21:24,491
- Our job was to crack Enigma.
- Well, we've done that.

1147
01:21:26,369 --> 01:21:28,037
Now for the hard part.

1148
01:21:29,831 --> 01:21:31,790
- Keeping it a secret.
- Carlisle.

1149
01:21:32,876 --> 01:21:34,543
What?

1150
01:21:34,628 --> 01:21:37,212
The convoy you're about to...
It's, er...

1151
01:21:37,339 --> 01:21:39,673
The HMS Carlisle is one of the ships.

1152
01:21:41,801 --> 01:21:44,219
We can't act on every
piece of intelligence.

1153
01:21:44,346 --> 01:21:45,888
So, fine, we won't.

1154
01:21:46,973 --> 01:21:48,390
Just this one.

1155
01:21:48,808 --> 01:21:50,643
Peter, what's the matter with you?

1156
01:21:51,686 --> 01:21:53,395
My... My brother's...

1157
01:21:53,521 --> 01:21:55,397
Well, he's on the Carlisle.

1158
01:21:57,901 --> 01:21:59,568
A gunnery ensign.

1159
01:22:02,697 --> 01:22:04,073
I'm...

1160
01:22:06,242 --> 01:22:07,701
I'm so sorry.

1161
01:22:10,413 --> 01:22:12,706
Who the hell do you think you are?

1162
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:14,917
This... This is my brother.

1163
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:18,837
Look, he's my big brother, all right?

1164
01:22:18,922 --> 01:22:20,506
And you have a few minutes
to call off his murder.

1165
01:22:21,508 --> 01:22:23,384
We can't.

1166
01:22:25,095 --> 01:22:26,553
He's right.

1167
01:22:27,722 --> 01:22:29,181
Alan...

1168
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:31,558
Joan...

1169
01:22:33,436 --> 01:22:35,437
Hugh... John.

1170
01:22:37,607 --> 01:22:39,608
Oh, please, I...

1171
01:22:39,693 --> 01:22:41,527
The Germans, they won't get suspicious

1172
01:22:41,611 --> 01:22:43,112
just because we stop one attack.

1173
01:22:43,697 --> 01:22:45,114
No one will know.

1174
01:22:46,074 --> 01:22:48,575
I'm asking you as your friend.

1175
01:22:50,203 --> 01:22:51,620
Please.

1176
01:22:55,291 --> 01:22:56,750
I'm so sorry.

1177
01:22:58,128 --> 01:23:01,380
You're not God, Alan, you don't
get to decide who lives and who dies.

1178
01:23:02,382 --> 01:23:03,757
Yes, we do.

1179
01:23:07,095 --> 01:23:08,303
Why?

1180
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:10,723
Because no one else can.

1181
01:23:59,105 --> 01:24:00,522
Why are you telling me this?

1182
01:24:01,858 --> 01:24:07,029
We need your help to keep this a secret
from Admiralty, Army, RAF.

1183
01:24:08,865 --> 01:24:13,660
No one can know we broke Enigma.
Not even Denniston.

1184
01:24:14,704 --> 01:24:16,663
Who's in the process
of having you fired.

1185
01:24:17,123 --> 01:24:18,540
You can take care of that.

1186
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:21,293
While we develop a system
to help you determine

1187
01:24:21,377 --> 01:24:24,379
how much intelligence to act on.

1188
01:24:24,464 --> 01:24:26,840
Which, er, attacks to stop,
which to let through.

1189
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:29,384
Statistical analysis.

1190
01:24:29,469 --> 01:24:33,138
The minimal number of actions
it would take for us to win the war

1191
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:38,811
but the maximum number we can take
before the Germans get suspicious.

1192
01:24:39,562 --> 01:24:42,731
And you're going to
trust all this to statistics?

1193
01:24:44,234 --> 01:24:45,734
- To maths?
- Correct.

1194
01:24:45,819 --> 01:24:49,404
And then MI6 can come up with
the lies that we tell everybody else.

1195
01:24:49,489 --> 01:24:51,657
You'll need a believable
alternative source

1196
01:24:51,741 --> 01:24:54,326
for all the pieces
of information you use.

1197
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:56,495
A false story so that we can explain

1198
01:24:56,579 --> 01:24:59,498
how we got our information
that has nothing to do with Enigma.

1199
01:24:59,582 --> 01:25:02,668
And then you can leak those
stories to the, er, the Germans.

1200
01:25:02,752 --> 01:25:04,336
And then to our own military.

1201
01:25:10,593 --> 01:25:14,680
Maintain a conspiracy of lies
at the highest levels of government?

1202
01:25:23,189 --> 01:25:24,857
Sounds right up my alley.

1203
01:25:28,778 --> 01:25:32,114
Alan, I so rarely
have cause to say this,

1204
01:25:32,198 --> 01:25:35,617
but you are exactly the man
I always hoped you would be.

1205
01:25:49,632 --> 01:25:52,467
They codenamed it Ultra.

1206
01:25:52,594 --> 01:25:57,055
It became the largest store
of military intelligence

1207
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:58,765
in the history of the world.

1208
01:26:05,815 --> 01:26:08,817
It was like having a tap
on Himmler's intercom.

1209
01:26:09,652 --> 01:26:11,111
I-E-O...

1210
01:26:12,447 --> 01:26:13,822
T-X-X...

1211
01:26:13,948 --> 01:26:16,158
Secrecy became
the primary concern

1212
01:26:16,242 --> 01:26:19,119
and for some reason, they...
They trusted me.

1213
01:26:20,997 --> 01:26:25,500
Peter, do you have the, er...
the 6:30 decrypt?

1214
01:27:06,209 --> 01:27:07,709
It's a Beale cipher.

1215
01:27:07,835 --> 01:27:09,294
Encrypted with a phrase from a...

1216
01:27:09,379 --> 01:27:12,214
"Ask, and it shall be given
to you; seek and ye will find."

1217
01:27:12,298 --> 01:27:14,716
Matthew 7:7. That was the key.

1218
01:27:14,842 --> 01:27:17,052
Peter will come around eventually.

1219
01:27:25,728 --> 01:27:27,562
Jack?

1220
01:27:27,647 --> 01:27:29,564
Could you give Alan
and me a moment, please?

1221
01:27:41,494 --> 01:27:44,371
The Soviets and us,
we're on the same side.

1222
01:27:45,373 --> 01:27:47,916
What I'm doing will help Britain.

1223
01:27:48,042 --> 01:27:50,544
I have to tell Denniston.

1224
01:27:51,587 --> 01:27:52,838
No, you don't.

1225
01:27:54,173 --> 01:27:56,258
Because if you tell him my secret,

1226
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:58,593
I'll tell him yours.

1227
01:28:01,097 --> 01:28:03,682
Do you know what they do to homosexuals?

1228
01:28:04,934 --> 01:28:07,936
You'll never be able to work again.
Never be able to teach.

1229
01:28:08,062 --> 01:28:09,438
Your precious machine?

1230
01:28:10,606 --> 01:28:12,607
I doubt you'll ever see him again.

1231
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:30,125
Hello. Can I...

1232
01:28:30,209 --> 01:28:33,045
um, speak to Stewart Menzies,
please? It's urgent.

1233
01:28:33,129 --> 01:28:35,047
One moment, please.

1234
01:28:38,468 --> 01:28:39,968
Hello. Menzies.

1235
01:28:43,389 --> 01:28:46,266
Some advice
about keeping secrets.

1236
01:28:48,811 --> 01:28:52,481
It's a lot easier if you
don't know them in the first place.

1237
01:28:53,649 --> 01:28:57,903
Were they steaming my letters,
tapping my telephone?

1238
01:28:57,987 --> 01:29:00,238
Trailing my nervous walks?

1239
01:29:01,449 --> 01:29:02,741
You know, I...

1240
01:29:03,826 --> 01:29:05,660
I never did find out.

1241
01:29:06,496 --> 01:29:07,954
Joan?

1242
01:29:12,293 --> 01:29:13,960
Joan? What's...

1243
01:29:16,923 --> 01:29:19,132
Oh. Where's Joan?

1244
01:29:20,676 --> 01:29:22,302
Military prison.

1245
01:29:24,847 --> 01:29:26,765
What have you done?

1246
01:29:26,849 --> 01:29:28,350
Decoded Enigma intercepts.

1247
01:29:28,476 --> 01:29:30,268
I found a pile of them
in the bedside table.

1248
01:29:30,353 --> 01:29:33,522
No, no. I... I gave those to her
over a year ago

1249
01:29:33,648 --> 01:29:35,440
when I was trying to figure out

1250
01:29:35,525 --> 01:29:37,359
- a link between...
- I'm sure you did.

1251
01:29:37,485 --> 01:29:39,444
Denniston's been looking
for a Soviet spy.

1252
01:29:39,529 --> 01:29:40,987
He's been looking inside Hut 8.

1253
01:29:43,032 --> 01:29:44,449
I know who the spy is.

1254
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:47,994
It... It's not Joan. It's...

1255
01:29:49,705 --> 01:29:51,790
It's Cairncross.

1256
01:29:51,874 --> 01:29:55,001
I... I found the Beale cipher,
the Bible.

1257
01:29:56,379 --> 01:29:58,672
God, I wish you'd been the spy.

1258
01:30:00,341 --> 01:30:02,134
You'd be so much better
at this than he is.

1259
01:30:03,845 --> 01:30:05,637
You knew it was him?

1260
01:30:05,721 --> 01:30:07,556
Of course I bloody knew.

1261
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,724
I knew before he came to Bletchley.

1262
01:30:10,643 --> 01:30:12,144
Why do you think I had him placed here?

1263
01:30:12,228 --> 01:30:14,855
But we have an Enigma machine.

1264
01:30:15,189 --> 01:30:16,481
Yes, Polish Intelligence smuggled...

1265
01:30:16,566 --> 01:30:17,983
So what's the problem?

1266
01:30:18,067 --> 01:30:22,571
You placed a...
a Soviet agent at Bletchley Park?

1267
01:30:22,655 --> 01:30:25,866
It's really quite useful to be able to
leak whatever we want to Stalin.

1268
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:29,911
Churchill's too damn paranoid.

1269
01:30:29,996 --> 01:30:33,915
He won't share a shred
of intelligence with the Soviets.

1270
01:30:34,041 --> 01:30:36,334
Not even information that
will help them against the Germans.

1271
01:30:36,419 --> 01:30:39,254
There's... so much secrecy.

1272
01:30:41,174 --> 01:30:44,176
Cairncross has no idea
we know, of course.

1273
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:46,761
He's really not the brightest bulb.

1274
01:30:48,222 --> 01:30:50,432
Which is why I need your help.

1275
01:30:50,558 --> 01:30:52,184
I want to know what to leak to John,

1276
01:30:52,268 --> 01:30:54,936
what to feed to the Soviets
as well as the British.

1277
01:30:55,062 --> 01:30:56,521
I...

1278
01:30:57,106 --> 01:30:59,566
I'm not a... I'm not a spy. I'm...

1279
01:31:00,359 --> 01:31:02,944
I'm just a mathematician.

1280
01:31:03,029 --> 01:31:05,113
I know a lot of spies, Alan.

1281
01:31:06,365 --> 01:31:09,367
You've got more secrets
than the best of them.

1282
01:31:13,706 --> 01:31:17,209
You... You have to promise me
that you will release Joan.

1283
01:31:18,044 --> 01:31:19,461
Yes, Joan's at the market.

1284
01:31:19,545 --> 01:31:21,796
She's going to be back
in an hour. I lied.

1285
01:31:23,966 --> 01:31:25,800
I'd better hold on to these.

1286
01:31:25,927 --> 01:31:29,763
If anybody finds out about them,
prison will be the least of her worries.

1287
01:31:32,266 --> 01:31:33,642
Oh, Alan,

1288
01:31:35,102 --> 01:31:37,729
we're going to have
such a wonderful war together.

1289
01:31:57,166 --> 01:31:58,750
I need you to leave Bletchley.

1290
01:31:58,834 --> 01:31:59,918
What?

1291
01:32:00,002 --> 01:32:02,420
It's Menzies.
I don't trust him.

1292
01:32:02,505 --> 01:32:04,172
It's not safe here.

1293
01:32:04,257 --> 01:32:05,840
Do you think
it's any safer anywhere else?

1294
01:32:05,925 --> 01:32:08,343
You need to get away.
You need to get very far away from me.

1295
01:32:08,427 --> 01:32:09,844
Alan, what's happened?

1296
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:16,935
We can't be engaged any more. You...

1297
01:32:17,019 --> 01:32:20,522
Your parents need to take you back
and find you a husband elsewhere.

1298
01:32:22,441 --> 01:32:24,526
What's wrong with you?

1299
01:32:25,486 --> 01:32:28,321
I have something, er, to tell you.

1300
01:32:28,698 --> 01:32:29,864
I'm...

1301
01:32:33,035 --> 01:32:34,661
I'm a homosexual.

1302
01:32:37,790 --> 01:32:40,875
- All right.
- No, no. Men, Joan.

1303
01:32:42,628 --> 01:32:44,379
- Not women.
- So what?

1304
01:32:45,548 --> 01:32:47,048
Well, I... I just told you.

1305
01:32:47,174 --> 01:32:48,550
So what?

1306
01:32:51,721 --> 01:32:53,888
I had my suspicions, I always did.

1307
01:32:55,224 --> 01:32:59,060
But we're not like other people.
We love each other in our own way

1308
01:32:59,186 --> 01:33:01,229
and we can have the life together
that we want.

1309
01:33:01,355 --> 01:33:03,690
You... You won't be the perfect husband.

1310
01:33:04,650 --> 01:33:07,902
Well, I can promise you, I harbour
no intention of being the perfect wife.

1311
01:33:07,987 --> 01:33:12,490
I'll not be fixing your lamb all day
while you come home from the office.

1312
01:33:12,575 --> 01:33:14,075
I'll work.

1313
01:33:14,994 --> 01:33:16,411
You'll work.

1314
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:20,081
And we'll have each other's company.

1315
01:33:20,916 --> 01:33:23,209
We'll have each other's minds.

1316
01:33:23,711 --> 01:33:26,379
That sounds like a better
marriage than most.

1317
01:33:28,758 --> 01:33:30,383
Because I care for you.

1318
01:33:31,927 --> 01:33:33,511
And you care for me.

1319
01:33:35,598 --> 01:33:37,265
And we understand
one another more than...

1320
01:33:37,350 --> 01:33:39,768
more than anyone else ever has.

1321
01:33:41,604 --> 01:33:43,021
I don't.

1322
01:33:46,776 --> 01:33:48,401
- What?
- Care for you.

1323
01:33:49,278 --> 01:33:50,695
I never did.

1324
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:53,782
I... I just needed you to break Enigma.

1325
01:33:53,908 --> 01:33:56,701
I've done that now, so... So you can go.

1326
01:34:02,541 --> 01:34:04,584
I'm not going anywhere.

1327
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,712
I've spent entirely too much of my life

1328
01:34:07,797 --> 01:34:09,297
worried about what you think of me

1329
01:34:09,382 --> 01:34:11,299
or what my parents think of me

1330
01:34:11,384 --> 01:34:13,468
or the boys in Hut 8
or the girls in Hut 3.

1331
01:34:13,552 --> 01:34:15,136
And do you know what? I'm done.

1332
01:34:16,722 --> 01:34:19,974
This is the most important
work I will ever do

1333
01:34:20,059 --> 01:34:23,436
and no one is going to stop me,
least of all you.

1334
01:34:26,315 --> 01:34:28,733
Do you know what? They were right.

1335
01:34:29,652 --> 01:34:31,820
Peter, Hugh, John.

1336
01:34:35,449 --> 01:34:37,075
You really are a monster.

1337
01:34:56,053 --> 01:35:00,765
The war dragged on
for two more solitary years

1338
01:35:03,185 --> 01:35:06,896
and every day we performed
our blood-soaked calculus.

1339
01:35:09,150 --> 01:35:12,485
Every day we decided
who lived and who died.

1340
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:17,407
Every day we helped the Allies
to victories and nobody knew.

1341
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:23,079
Stalingrad.

1342
01:35:23,956 --> 01:35:26,875
The Ardenne. The invasion of Normandy.

1343
01:35:28,043 --> 01:35:30,211
All victories that would not
have been possible

1344
01:35:30,296 --> 01:35:32,422
without the intelligence
that we supplied.

1345
01:35:33,799 --> 01:35:36,718
And people talk about the war

1346
01:35:36,802 --> 01:35:40,763
as this epic battle
between civilisations.

1347
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:46,019
Freedom versus tyranny.
Democracy versus Nazism.

1348
01:35:47,688 --> 01:35:51,816
Armies of millions
bleeding into the ground.

1349
01:35:51,901 --> 01:35:55,069
Fleets of ships
weighing down the oceans.

1350
01:35:55,154 --> 01:35:59,073
Planes dropping bombs from the sky
until they obliterated the sun itself.

1351
01:36:01,202 --> 01:36:03,620
The war wasn't like that for us.

1352
01:36:06,665 --> 01:36:08,124
For us it was just...

1353
01:36:10,085 --> 01:36:12,045
half a dozen crossword enthusiasts

1354
01:36:12,129 --> 01:36:14,631
in a tiny village
in the South of England.

1355
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,511
...your victory.

1356
01:36:19,595 --> 01:36:21,054
It is the victory

1357
01:36:22,306 --> 01:36:26,601
of the cause of freedom in every land.

1358
01:36:31,023 --> 01:36:34,400
This is a solemn but glorious hour.

1359
01:36:35,861 --> 01:36:40,281
I wish that Franklin D Roosevelt
had lived to see this day.

1360
01:36:41,325 --> 01:36:42,951
Was I God? No.

1361
01:36:43,619 --> 01:36:46,329
Because God didn't
win the war,

1362
01:36:47,706 --> 01:36:49,165
we did.

1363
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:03,638
So what happens now?

1364
01:37:05,266 --> 01:37:08,476
Is it back to university for us,
I suppose?

1365
01:37:09,270 --> 01:37:10,687
Yes, pretty much.

1366
01:37:10,771 --> 01:37:12,355
But you've one other thing left to do

1367
01:37:12,439 --> 01:37:14,649
before your service
to your government is concluded.

1368
01:37:14,733 --> 01:37:17,652
- What's that?
- Burn everything.

1369
01:37:17,736 --> 01:37:19,195
Burn? Why?

1370
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:22,323
You were told when you started
this was a top secret programme.

1371
01:37:22,408 --> 01:37:24,033
Did you think we were joking?

1372
01:37:24,868 --> 01:37:26,327
But the war is over.

1373
01:37:26,412 --> 01:37:28,663
This war is.
But there'll be others.

1374
01:37:28,747 --> 01:37:31,082
And we know how to break a code

1375
01:37:31,166 --> 01:37:33,793
that everybody else
believes is unbreakable.

1376
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:36,087
Precisely.

1377
01:37:37,756 --> 01:37:39,465
Tear it down, light it up.

1378
01:37:39,550 --> 01:37:42,885
Sweep away the ashes.
None of you have ever met before.

1379
01:37:42,970 --> 01:37:46,222
None of you have ever
even heard the word "Enigma".

1380
01:37:48,475 --> 01:37:50,184
Have a safe trip home.

1381
01:37:53,647 --> 01:37:55,356
Behave.

1382
01:37:55,441 --> 01:37:57,150
With a bit of luck,
you'll never have to see me

1383
01:37:57,234 --> 01:37:59,777
or one another again
for the rest of your lives.

1384
01:38:15,294 --> 01:38:16,794
That's unbelievable.

1385
01:38:18,964 --> 01:38:20,882
Now, Detective,

1386
01:38:22,885 --> 01:38:24,552
you get to judge.

1387
01:38:27,139 --> 01:38:28,598
So tell me,

1388
01:38:30,392 --> 01:38:31,851
what am I?

1389
01:38:33,687 --> 01:38:37,523
Am I a machine? Am I a person?

1390
01:38:39,401 --> 01:38:40,985
Am I a war hero?

1391
01:38:43,656 --> 01:38:45,490
Am I a criminal?

1392
01:38:49,536 --> 01:38:51,204
I can't judge you.

1393
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,958
Well, then.

1394
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:02,298
You're no help to me at all.

1395
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:06,928
Come in.

1396
01:39:11,308 --> 01:39:13,351
You wanted to see me, sir?

1397
01:39:13,435 --> 01:39:15,144
Turing. Sit down.

1398
01:39:27,533 --> 01:39:28,950
Is something the matter?

1399
01:39:29,952 --> 01:39:32,495
You and Christopher Morcom
are quite close.

1400
01:39:32,579 --> 01:39:34,455
I wouldn't say that.

1401
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:36,040
Well, your mathematics teacher says

1402
01:39:36,125 --> 01:39:37,750
the two of you
are positively inseparable.

1403
01:39:37,835 --> 01:39:39,794
We're the best students in the class.

1404
01:39:40,754 --> 01:39:42,755
He caught you passing
notes the other day.

1405
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,883
Cryptography, to pass the time.
The class is too simple.

1406
01:39:45,968 --> 01:39:49,846
You and your friend solve
maths problems during maths class

1407
01:39:49,930 --> 01:39:51,597
because the maths class is too dull?

1408
01:39:52,474 --> 01:39:54,183
He's not my friend.

1409
01:39:54,268 --> 01:39:57,645
- Well, I'm told he's your only friend.
- Who said that?

1410
01:40:00,774 --> 01:40:03,484
Something's come up concerning Morcom.

1411
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:05,862
Why am I here?

1412
01:40:08,657 --> 01:40:10,408
Christopher is dead.

1413
01:40:18,959 --> 01:40:20,543
I don't understand.

1414
01:40:20,627 --> 01:40:24,672
His mother sent word this morning.
The family were on holiday, you see.

1415
01:40:29,219 --> 01:40:30,803
I don't understand.

1416
01:40:30,888 --> 01:40:34,766
Well, he had bovine tuberculosis,
as I'm sure he told you.

1417
01:40:35,976 --> 01:40:41,314
So this won't come as a shock
but still, all the same, I'm sorry.

1418
01:40:43,484 --> 01:40:45,109
You're mistaken.

1419
01:40:46,737 --> 01:40:48,196
Did he not tell you?

1420
01:40:49,406 --> 01:40:51,824
Well, he's been sick for a long time.

1421
01:40:51,909 --> 01:40:53,951
He knew this was coming soon.

1422
01:40:55,370 --> 01:40:57,205
But he had a stiff upper lip about it.

1423
01:40:57,289 --> 01:40:58,790
Good lad.

1424
01:41:00,876 --> 01:41:02,919
- Are you all right, Turing?
- Yes. Of course.

1425
01:41:03,003 --> 01:41:05,838
Like I said,
I didn't know him very well.

1426
01:41:05,923 --> 01:41:09,175
Ah, I see. Very well.

1427
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:16,057
May I leave, Headmaster?

1428
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:32,073
Congratulations, sir.

1429
01:41:59,768 --> 01:42:01,227
Sorry.

1430
01:42:05,732 --> 01:42:08,734
I would have come.
I would have testified.

1431
01:42:09,903 --> 01:42:13,698
And what would you have said?
That I... I wasn't a homosexual?

1432
01:42:13,782 --> 01:42:17,243
Alan, this is serious.
They could send you to jail.

1433
01:42:17,327 --> 01:42:18,744
Oh, damn it.

1434
01:42:22,082 --> 01:42:25,167
- Your hands, you're twitching.
- No. No, I'm not.

1435
01:42:25,252 --> 01:42:26,669
- Alan.
- Er...

1436
01:42:28,839 --> 01:42:30,590
It's the medication.

1437
01:42:31,758 --> 01:42:33,175
The medication?

1438
01:42:34,595 --> 01:42:38,222
Well, the judge gave me, um, a choice.

1439
01:42:38,307 --> 01:42:42,476
Either two years in prison or
hor... hormonal therapy.

1440
01:42:42,561 --> 01:42:43,978
Oh, my God.

1441
01:42:45,022 --> 01:42:47,440
- Oh, my God!
- Yes, yes, that's right.

1442
01:42:47,524 --> 01:42:50,067
Chemical castration.

1443
01:42:50,152 --> 01:42:54,113
To, er, to cure me of my, um,
homosexual predilections.

1444
01:42:55,908 --> 01:42:58,409
Well, of course I chose that.
I mean, I couldn't...

1445
01:42:59,745 --> 01:43:01,746
work in prison and...

1446
01:43:02,748 --> 01:43:04,165
All right.

1447
01:43:06,001 --> 01:43:07,919
Now, I'm going to speak to your doctors.

1448
01:43:08,003 --> 01:43:10,755
- I'm going to speak to your lawyers.
- I'm... I'm fine.

1449
01:43:10,839 --> 01:43:12,590
- Please let me help you.
- No, I...

1450
01:43:12,674 --> 01:43:15,134
I don't need your help, thank you.

1451
01:43:15,677 --> 01:43:17,553
Alan, you do not have to do this alone.

1452
01:43:18,889 --> 01:43:20,473
I'm not alone.

1453
01:43:24,144 --> 01:43:25,728
Never have been.

1454
01:43:30,233 --> 01:43:32,693
Christopher's become so smart.

1455
01:43:35,906 --> 01:43:40,034
If I don't continue
my treatment, then they'll...

1456
01:43:43,747 --> 01:43:46,540
They'll take him away from me.

1457
01:43:47,292 --> 01:43:48,709
You...

1458
01:43:51,672 --> 01:43:55,508
You... You... You can't let them
do that. You can't.

1459
01:43:56,677 --> 01:43:59,470
You... You can't let them
leave me alone.

1460
01:44:02,641 --> 01:44:04,308
I don't... I don't want to be alone.

1461
01:44:04,393 --> 01:44:05,893
I don't want to be alone.

1462
01:44:05,978 --> 01:44:07,895
All right, all right.

1463
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:09,981
All right.

1464
01:44:10,983 --> 01:44:13,109
It's all right, come and sit down.

1465
01:44:16,488 --> 01:44:18,614
It's all right. Come and sit down.

1466
01:44:22,494 --> 01:44:23,953
It's all right.

1467
01:44:34,548 --> 01:44:38,009
Oh, well...

1468
01:44:38,093 --> 01:44:41,387
That's a much nicer ring
than the one I... I made you.

1469
01:44:41,471 --> 01:44:43,139
Yes.

1470
01:44:43,223 --> 01:44:44,974
His name's Jock.

1471
01:44:45,058 --> 01:44:47,810
He's an army man,
if you can believe it.

1472
01:44:47,894 --> 01:44:50,312
We work together.

1473
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:55,943
Why don't we do a crossword puzzle?

1474
01:44:57,279 --> 01:44:59,155
It'll only take us five minutes.

1475
01:44:59,239 --> 01:45:00,781
Or in your case, six.

1476
01:45:05,871 --> 01:45:07,288
There.

1477
01:45:30,771 --> 01:45:32,772
Perhaps later.

1478
01:45:34,107 --> 01:45:35,566
Yes, of course.

1479
01:45:41,490 --> 01:45:43,574
You got what you wanted, didn't you?

1480
01:45:44,701 --> 01:45:46,285
Work, a husband.

1481
01:45:47,621 --> 01:45:49,080
Normal life.

1482
01:45:59,466 --> 01:46:01,967
No one normal could have done that.

1483
01:46:06,056 --> 01:46:08,099
Do you know, this morning,

1484
01:46:09,267 --> 01:46:13,604
I was on a train that went
through a city that wouldn't exist

1485
01:46:13,688 --> 01:46:15,689
if it wasn't for you.

1486
01:46:17,359 --> 01:46:21,737
I bought a ticket from a man
who would likely be dead

1487
01:46:21,822 --> 01:46:24,073
if it wasn't for you.

1488
01:46:24,157 --> 01:46:25,991
I read up on my work,

1489
01:46:27,369 --> 01:46:30,913
a whole field of scientific inquiry

1490
01:46:30,997 --> 01:46:34,041
that only exists because of you.

1491
01:46:37,212 --> 01:46:40,172
Now, if you wish
you could have been normal,

1492
01:46:42,509 --> 01:46:44,718
I can promise you, I do not.

1493
01:46:46,888 --> 01:46:49,682
The world is an infinitely better place

1494
01:46:49,766 --> 01:46:52,101
precisely because you weren't.

1495
01:46:55,897 --> 01:46:57,314
Do you...

1496
01:46:58,066 --> 01:46:59,900
Do you really think that?

1497
01:47:01,444 --> 01:47:02,903
I think

1498
01:47:04,072 --> 01:47:07,867
that sometimes it is the people
who no one imagines anything of

1499
01:47:07,951 --> 01:47:12,496
who do the things
that no one can imagine.
