1
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,158
Motherfuckers!

2
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,229
Fuck.

3
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,240
Fuck!

4
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,671
We're almost home, buddy!

5
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,749
Hey.

6
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,557
My name's Alan and I bought a giraffe!

7
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,631
He's all mine!

8
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,039
He's super friendly!

9
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,919
Look at the giraffe.

10
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,071
Oh, my God. Where do you think it's going?

11
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,271
Oh, my life is great! I have a wonderful life!

12
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,230
I have a wonderful life!

13
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,550
Yes, sir. Absolutely, I will.
Thank you so much. No, of course.

14
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,754
No, no. And again, I'm so sorry.

15
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,391
That was the mayor, Alan.

16
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,519
It was an accident.

17
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,794
You said you'd always love me
no matter what I did.

18
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,589
I know and I do. You're my best friend.
But, Alan, why would you buy a giraffe?

19
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,354
I've always wanted one.

20
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,154
I could feed him from my tree house.

21
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,311
Besides, they remind me a lot of myself.

22
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,835
In what way?

23
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,628
They're majestic, pensive and tall.

24
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,756
- Pensive?
- Yeah.

25
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,309
- Where'd you learn that word?
- Words With Friends.

26
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,948
- What friends, Alan?
- You can set it on random.

27
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,030
Alan, aside from the fact
that you shut down a freeway...

28
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,876
you murdered a wild animal.
It's national news.

29
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,918
You don't want to know the checks
I had to write to fix this.

30
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,832
Oh, please. We're rich.

31
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,275
We are not anything, Alan.

32
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,955
I am well-off. You are my 40-year-old son.

33
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,712
Forty-two. I'm 42!

34
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,190
42-year-old son who still lives at home.

35
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,670
You are to go back on your medication
or I'm cutting you off.

36
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,552
You're bluffing. When's dinner?

37
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,435
Your mother and I can't take this anymore!

38
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,353
- Well, you might have to.
- I can't do it!

39
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,635
I cannot do this!

40
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,595
Alan! Alan!

41
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,957
<i>Ave</i>

42
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,832
<i>Maria</i>

43
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,350
My God, he's got the voice of an angel.

44
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,033
It's breathtaking.

45
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,431
<i>Ave</i>

46
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:59,312
<i>Maria</i>

47
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,992
I can't believe my daddy is dead.

48
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,958
I can think of so many people
I would rather have died first.

49
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,314
Like my mother.

50
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,108
As many of you know...

51
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,636
my father and I were extremely close.

52
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,078
He was my life partner.

53
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,470
He would often tell me,
almost on a daily basis...

54
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,198
that I was his favorite child.

55
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,711
I'll always remember the last words
he said to me.

56
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,272
I'm proud of you, Alan.

57
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,959
Never change.

58
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,878
Well...

59
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,793
I heard you loud and clear, Daddy.

60
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,351
I will never change.

61
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,159
Never ever.

62
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,754
Oh, Mom.

63
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,992
Go ahead, chief.

64
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,796
Sid Garner was a beloved husband...

65
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,439
father and neighbor.

66
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,996
Wow, rough day.

67
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,799
- Yeah, how's Tracy doing?
- Not great.

68
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,997
Her mother's totally on the edge,
and if all this weren't enough...

69
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,879
apparently Alan's been off his meds
for almost six months.

70
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,189
Oh, boy.

71
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,316
Yeah, it has not been pretty.

72
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,995
- Then there's the whole fucking giraffe thing.
- I thought that was pretty funny.

73
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,912
- What?
- Come on. He killed a giraffe.

74
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,672
Who gives a fuck?

75
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,592
You know, I wasn't gonna say anything,
but Alan's been stopping by my office lately.

76
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,557
You're kidding me. What for?

77
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,191
I don't know. He just sits in the waiting room
and reads Highlights magazine.

78
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,477
Fills in the puzzles, whatever he can,
and then leaves.

79
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,159
Check it out.

80
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,914
Jesus, what are you gonna do with him?

81
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,674
Actually,
I wanted to talk to you guys about that.

82
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,274
Linda really wants to stage
an intervention for him.

83
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,192
An intervention? Really?

84
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,078
I think that sounds like a great idea.

85
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,992
Yeah, the thing is...

86
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,676
she's pretty convinced he won't agree to it
unless all of us are there.

87
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,559
I mean, you know how he is.

88
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,757
I don't know. It seems a little extreme to me.

89
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,633
Oh, God. Look at him now.

90
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,273
Okay, I'm in. When are we doing it?

91
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,078
So we talked to Tracy today...

92
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,550
and she said that the treatment facility
that they found is really nice.

93
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,598
It's beautiful. I checked it out online.
Great reputation.

94
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,639
Who gives a fuck? It's in Arizona. We gotta
go on like a two-day drive for this shit?

95
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,789
Here we go.

96
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,554
They should just save their money
and send him to fat camp.

97
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,709
- Phil.
- What?

98
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,792
He should lose weight. He'll find a woman.
The dude's lonely.

99
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,713
If he's so lonely, why don't the two of you
spend more time with him?

100
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,111
- No, trust me, you don't want that.
- No. You definitely don't want that.

101
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,111
Come on. He's not that bad.

102
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,078
I mean, what's the worst that's happened?
The tattoo?

103
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,630
Yeah, the tattoo's the worst.

104
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,915
Right?

105
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,913
Definitely. Tattoo was the worst. Nightmare.

106
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,071
Speaking of which, you ever get tested?

107
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,355
Excuse me?

108
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,839
You know, because of the ink.

109
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,354
That went inside you.

110
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,073
I'm fine.

111
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,630
- Take care.
- All right, good luck tomorrow.

112
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,153
Oh, thanks.

113
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,956
- I'll pick you up at 11.
- Perfect.

114
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,155
Thank you so much.

115
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,753
Thanks.

116
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,272
Again, thank you so much
for coming.

117
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,475
Oh, of course.

118
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,393
This is Nico. Nico is a good friend of Alan's.

119
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,518
- What's up, bros?
- Oh, yeah, hey.

120
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,350
And that's Blanca. Blanca's been with us
since Alan was a baby.

121
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,794
- Hello.
- Hello.

122
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,997
And this is Timothy.
Timothy lives across the street.

123
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,559
He and Alan swim together.

124
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,756
- Hey, what's up, little man?
- Hey.

125
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,911
- Why don't you guys take a seat?
- Yeah.

126
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,956
Tracy's on her way back
with Alan right now.

127
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,591
Obviously, he has no idea this is coming,
so things might get a little intense.

128
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,194
But, no matter what happens, remember...

129
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,158
this is all about Alan getting better.

130
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,875
Mother, Oreo smoothie, now!

131
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,677
- Hey, everyone.
- Hey.

132
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,593
Hey, Timothy.
Little cold for a swim, isn't it?

133
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,552
Oh, wow. Look. You went to the pier today.
How was that?

134
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,631
- We had a great time.
- Yeah.

135
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,679
I played skee ball for like 45 minutes.
It was a pretty sick workout.

136
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,512
What's going on?

137
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,275
Why don't you have a seat, bud?
We just want to talk to you for a sec.

138
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,192
Okay.

139
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,469
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey. Yeah.

140
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,029
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

141
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,309
Oh, you got me.

142
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,633
So, Alan...

143
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,759
we're all here to tell you
about an awesome place...

144
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,478
called New Horizons.

145
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,432
That does sound awesome.

146
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,274
Alan, this is an intervention.

147
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,749
A what?

148
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,839
Alan.

149
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,916
I love you so much. We all do.

150
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,992
But we can't keep lying to each other.

151
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,957
Ever since you were a baby, all I want...

152
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,315
Oh, my God, is anybody else falling asleep?

153
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,595
Alan, listen.

154
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,069
- No offense, Mom, but you're boring.
- Mr. Alan.

155
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,429
Oh, now you?

156
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,273
I pick up after you for 30 years.

157
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,274
I cleaned your room.
I see things no one should ever see.

158
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,039
But I pray for you.

159
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,869
- Mr. Alan, everyone...
- Hey.

160
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,996
- Someone should clean that up.
- Alan.

161
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,118
Alan. You are not well.

162
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,272
You're off your meds and you're
clearly upsetting your whole family.

163
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,591
- That's baloney.
- Alan, if you say yes to this...

164
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,230
we drive you there today, and I promise
you will come back a changed man.

165
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,594
Who's we? What do you mean, we?
Who's we?

166
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,911
We. All of us. Stu, Phil, me, you.

167
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,238
You going, Phil?

168
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,631
I love you, Alan.

169
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,473
Hey, Alan, you hungry?

170
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,517
You wanna get some Arby's?

171
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,272
No, thanks.

172
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,109
You know, I meant to tell you earlier,
that's a really cool vest you got on.

173
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,917
Thanks, Phil. It was my dad's.

174
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,399
He died in it.

175
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,638
That's intense.

176
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,509
Hey, Alan, just want to say what you're
doing is really brave. We're proud of you.

177
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,352
Yeah, you're gonna do great.

178
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,195
Stop the car.
I don't want to do this anymore.

179
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,237
- What?
- I changed my mind.

180
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,153
Alan, you can't change your mind.
Everybody's counting on you.

181
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,880
I'm fine just the way I am.
I want to go home.

182
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,632
Turn the car around. Now, please! I don't...

183
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,633
What the fuck was that?

184
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,234
- Oh, my God! He's doing it on purpose!
- Get out of his way!

185
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,799
I am! I am!

186
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,357
- Hey! Hey, get the fuck off!
- You have to exchange information.

187
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,194
- Why?
- Jesus. Phil!

188
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,679
- Phil! Phil!
- Oh, shit!

189
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,555
- Get away from him!
- I'm trying!

190
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,996
- Look out!
- Oh, shit!

191
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,790
Aw, shit! Oh, shit.

192
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,389
Shit!

193
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,909
Go, go, go!

194
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,832
Lock your doors! Doug, lock your doors!

195
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,752
Shit! What's going on?

196
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,519
Get the fuck... Hang on!

197
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,833
- Help!
- Let go, fucking asshole!

198
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,437
- Stu! We're okay.
- We're in an elevator!

199
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,794
Where are you?

200
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,029
What the fuck is going on?

201
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,273
Please, this is a huge mistake.

202
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,879
You got the wrong guys!

203
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,032
I got the right fucking guys! Get him up.
Pick him up. Put him here.

204
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,119
- You're Black Doug! That's Black Doug!
- Shut the fuck up with that. Shut the fuck up.

205
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,872
Oh, my God. It is.

206
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,398
Alan, tell me right now,
why is Black Doug kidnapping us?

207
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,755
- I said don't call me that shit no more.
- Sorry.

208
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,036
- It ain't Alan's fault.
- Thank you, Black Doug.

209
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,277
- Motherfucker!
- Doug!

210
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,555
- Doug!
- Okay, okay.

211
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,869
- Just Doug, okay?
- Yeah.

212
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,995
Why are you doing this?

213
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,513
Because...

214
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,431
I told him to.

215
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,669
I'm Marshall.

216
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,078
And whether you know it or not...

217
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,075
we all have something in common.

218
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,231
And it all started four years ago
when this moron...

219
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,152
sold the wrong drugs to this dumb fuck.

220
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,950
You have no idea the chain of events
that were set in motion that night...

221
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,635
in the parking lot of a fucking liquor store.

222
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,549
What up, nigga?

223
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,279
Excuse me?

224
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,749
Chill out, I'm not a cop.
Just in town for the night.

225
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,911
Me and my boys looking to get our freak on.

226
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,036
You sold Alan roofies.

227
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,151
Oh, shit. I must've mixed up the bags.

228
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,594
My fault, Alan.

229
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,638
Damn. Marshall gonna be pissed off at me
on that one.

230
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,673
Damn. Marshall gonna be
pissed off at me on that one.

231
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,313
Marshall?

232
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,277
You're Marshall.

233
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,635
You brought us out here because of that?

234
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,310
You're not here because of that.

235
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,519
You're here because some Chinaman
I never heard of strolls into my town...

236
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,910
and takes one of my guys off the street.

237
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,672
- Mr. Chow?
- Yes.

238
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,910
Yes, Mr. Leslie fucking Chow.

239
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,036
You introduced a virus into my life.

240
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,954
Oh, God, what did he do?

241
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,348
He fucked me in the ass.

242
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,476
Oh, he does that from time to time.

243
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,432
Not literally.

244
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,789
Jesus!

245
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,150
A few weeks after your bullshit, I get word...

246
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,880
this sheik is coming in from Abu Dhabi.

247
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,511
He was looking to make some
less-than-legal investments.

248
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,799
He brought his two wives...

249
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,077
and $42 million in gold bars.

250
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,189
It was a lay-up.

251
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,713
Get down! Get down!

252
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,869
We took it all.

253
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,634
Two vans, each with 21 million in gold.

254
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,872
My guys split up.

255
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,596
One of them made it back...

256
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,638
one of them didn't.

257
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,314
Is there a problem, officer?

258
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,038
Not anymore, motherfucker.

259
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,435
Leslie Chow stole $21 million from me...

260
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,919
on a Tuesday.

261
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,792
Oh, God.

262
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,798
I looked everywhere for him.

263
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,791
But he's gone, no one can find him.

264
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,192
Until the little cockroach
got himself pinched in Bangkok.

265
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,038
So I pay him a visit.

266
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,195
I offer him a truce.

267
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,910
I won't touch a hair on his head.

268
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,390
I just want him to tell me where my gold is.

269
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,193
He refuses to talk.

270
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,712
Not only does he refuse to talk to me...

271
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,634
he has no communication with anyone
from the outside...

272
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,028
except you!

273
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,474
Hey.

274
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,959
It's unfair!

275
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,712
Alan, you been talking to Chow?

276
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,314
- They've been writing letters.
- Hey, those are private!

277
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,635
Dear Leslie, OMG, the McRib is back!
Why was it ever gone?

278
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,915
Exactly!

279
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,878
Dear Alan,
I threw urine on prison guard today.

280
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,076
Blamed it on cellmate. Wish you were here.

281
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,753
Yeah, I wish I could've seen that.

282
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,879
Letter after letter of total nonsense...

283
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,951
except for one common thread.

284
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,519
You guys!

285
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,509
The wolf pack.

286
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,033
Jesus Christ, Alan.

287
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,633
Five weeks ago, Chow escaped
from maximum security detention.

288
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,479
Oh, fuck.

289
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,518
He stowed aboard a shipping freighter
bound for the West Coast.

290
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,630
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

291
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,837
Alan, if you know where he is,
you tell this man right now.

292
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,877
Phil, I don't know, I swear.
I haven't talked to him in months.

293
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,352
We gotta do it the hard way.

294
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,038
- Oh, no!
- What the fuck? Hey!

295
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,316
- Let's go.
- Hey! No! No! What the fuck?

296
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,595
Whoa, what are you doing?

297
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,753
Doug is my insurance. He stays with me.

298
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,388
You don't give me Chow,
I blow his brains out.

299
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,788
You go to the cops...

300
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,395
I blow his brains out.

301
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,074
That's insane! We don't even know
where the fuck he is!

302
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,992
No one does.

303
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,436
But I figure the wolf pack
has the best chance of finding him.

304
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,635
You have three days.

305
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,713
Get to work.

306
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,076
Can you take Stu instead?

307
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,514
Fuck you, Alan.

308
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,949
Shit.

309
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,434
Shit!

310
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,396
- Alan.
- Yeah, Phil?

311
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,358
I need you to roll over here
and chew off these hand-ties.

312
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,669
Okay.

313
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,039
Damn it!

314
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,276
Oh, fuck!

315
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,631
- Got a little too much steam.
- Get off me.

316
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,791
All right, let me just shimmy down.

317
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,150
Would you just hold still? Hold still!

318
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,548
Help!

319
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,879
Help!

320
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,631
Holy shit.

321
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,229
What are we gonna do, Stu?

322
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,960
- We're gonna go to the police.
- Oh, no, we're fucking not.

323
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,078
Did you hear that guy?

324
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,639
He will kill Doug, period.

325
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,713
Chow is a cancer.

326
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,110
He's been a cancer
since the first day we met him.

327
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,919
We're gonna hand him over to Marshall
and then it's done.

328
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,229
- Hey, Phil.
- Alan, not now.

329
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,436
But I need you, Stu. I can't do this alone.

330
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,319
Do what alone?
We have no idea where he even is.

331
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,549
- Phil.
- What, Alan?

332
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,154
I was gonna say I got this strange e-mail
the other day.

333
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,630
I wasn't sure what it meant,
but now I think it might be from Chow.

334
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,918
Fatty, it feels good to be out.

335
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,992
I'm close by. Tell no one. I'll be in touch.

336
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,309
Chow.

337
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,472
This says Chow. How did you not know
this was from Chow?

338
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,915
At the time, I thought it was Chow
like goodbye.

339
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,672
You know, like Chow, arrivederci.

340
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,274
- You know, Sbarro, Papa John's.
- I'm writing him back.

341
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,112
Whoa, wait, wait. Just hold on.

342
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,669
Gonna tell him you're happy he's out
and you'd love to see him.

343
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,910
Ooh, I would love to see him.

344
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,312
Do you even know what's going on?

345
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,155
Yes, I do. Phil's doing all the work,
I'm his assistant.

346
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,915
- You're standing there looking like an idiot.
- I'm gonna arrange a meeting...

347
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,878
- And we're gonna take him out.
- Take him out?

348
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,076
Who says that?
How do we take someone out?

349
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,312
We'll use drugs.

350
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,118
Prescription drugs.

351
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,635
You know, the kind a dentist has access to.

352
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,997
Good luck finding a dentist
who will write fake prescriptions.

353
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,310
Oh, I know one. His name is Stuart Price.

354
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,198
Now let's go find a fucking pharmacy.

355
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,398
You just got schooled, son.

356
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,074
Are you coming or not?

357
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,593
I don't like this plan.

358
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,228
Okay then. Ciao.

359
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,430
I got a pretty dope sense of humor, bro!

360
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,240
This amount with syringes
is just weird. Go check it out.

361
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,829
Everything okay?

362
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,070
Well, it's just a strange request.

363
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,356
This drug in this amount
and a pack of syringes.

364
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,511
- It's just a little weird.
- Yeah.

365
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,433
It's just kind of an emergency, so....

366
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,149
See, that right there, and you're acting
all fidgety, plus you look like shit...

367
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,470
in our business, these are all red flags.

368
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,756
I need to call the doctor,
make sure everything's okay.

369
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,833
You're in luck, because I actually am
the prescribing doctor.

370
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,195
Oh, boy. Another red flag.

371
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,873
It says here you're a dentist.

372
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,032
Yeah. Doctor of Dental Science.

373
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,672
This is fucked up.

374
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,594
Hey, Dad?

375
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,632
I think we got a live one.

376
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,869
How'd we do?

377
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,793
We did good.
I got Demerol, a pack of syringes...

378
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,838
and almost lost my dental license.

379
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,831
- What about Chow? Anything?
- No.

380
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,594
Oh, look at this.
He e-mailed me like 20 minutes ago.

381
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,872
Alan, we've been sit...

382
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,393
Give me the phone, please.

383
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,511
- What does it say?
- Oh, wow.

384
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,718
He wants to meet Alan tonight at 8.
It says come alone.

385
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,518
- Come alone where?
- A bus stop.

386
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,829
In Tijuana.

387
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,399
Tijuana's the bomb.

388
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,834
Oh, fuck.

389
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,231
No, that's perfect.
No, it's like a three-hour drive from here.

390
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,631
Yeah, Stu, try reading a map.

391
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,078
Yeah, Alan, try reading anything ever.

392
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,800
Yeah, Stu, try not having
such big horse teeth.

393
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,956
All right, we need a plan.

394
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,475
They're meeting on a bus bench
in a public place...

395
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,552
so Alan needs to convince Chow
to go someplace more private.

396
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,190
Someplace where we can sneak up on him
and drug him.

397
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,709
Like where?

398
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,353
I don't know, like an alley.

399
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,794
What about a movie theater?

400
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,118
Fuck, that's actually a great idea.

401
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,470
The lights go down...

402
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,598
we take the seats behind him,
we jab him and it's fucking done.

403
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,474
I'll jab him if you want.
I've drugged people before.

404
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,233
Yeah, us.

405
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,756
No offense, but we're not letting you handle
any drugs. You'll kill someone.

406
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,433
Oh, please, I'm an expert.

407
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,318
Remember the marshmallows in Thailand?

408
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,549
Yeah?

409
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,996
I made it so you could eat at least three
before hitting a fatal dose.

410
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,673
Wait.

411
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,389
So you're saying I would've
died if I had four?

412
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,830
Nobody eats four marshmallows, Stu.

413
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,514
That insane theory is the only reason
I'm still alive?

414
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,114
Yes! And you're welcome, by the way.

415
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,589
Don't say you're welcome
for almost killing me.

416
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,749
- Fine.
- Thank you.

417
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,717
- You're welcome.
- Goddamn it!

418
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,639
Oh, God.

419
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,717
You know, you were right.

420
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,309
About what?

421
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,517
That place in Arizona.
It's not gonna help him.

422
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,520
There is no facility that can fix this guy.

423
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,033
We're gonna spend the rest of our lives
dealing with him...

424
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,351
because we're all he has now.

425
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,996
You realize that? We're it.

426
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,513
Oh, shit, check it out.

427
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,995
Is that Chow?

428
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,832
Hey, fat stuff.

429
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,049
Leslie.

430
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,550
- Act cool. Eyes forward.
- Yeah, okay.

431
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,110
- Anyone follow you?
- No, I don't think so.

432
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,554
Good, good.

433
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,076
Gotta keep low profile right now.
Chow wanted man.

434
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,192
Can't trust anyone.

435
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,193
Quick, give me some sugar.
Come on, come on, come on.

436
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,275
What the fuck?

437
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,351
Did he just kiss him?

438
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,478
Listen, I'm in a bit of a pickle, Alan.

439
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,279
- I need a friend.
- Well, I'm your friend, Leslie.

440
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,240
Exactly. That's why I called you down here.

441
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,198
You're the only person I can trust
in this shit-hole of a life.

442
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,590
That's not true.
Stu and Phil are your friends.

443
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,752
Oh, really?

444
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,313
That's interesting.

445
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,194
Where are they?

446
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,998
- Around.
- Around where?

447
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,275
I don't know.

448
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,191
- Motherfucker! I told you to come alone!
- Leslie.

449
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,349
Shit.

450
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,873
- What happened?
- Is he leaving?

451
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,871
We'll talk more! I'll give you another kiss!

452
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,109
He's coming this way.

453
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,952
Get down. Get down.

454
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,395
- Fuck.
- Leslie!

455
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,391
Oh, fuck.

456
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,031
- Get out of the car, you mutts!
- Leslie, no!

457
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,589
- Get off me, fat clown!
- Chow! Chow, calm down!

458
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,716
- Who sent you?
- No one! No.

459
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,997
- We just wanted to see you!
- Liar! No one wants to see Chow!

460
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,118
No, we miss you.

461
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,919
- What?
- We miss you, Chow!

462
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,275
- That's it.
- Yeah.

463
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,873
We miss you.

464
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,069
You miss me?

465
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,233
So much.

466
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,789
You miss Chow.

467
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,349
Yeah, buddy.

468
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,189
We love you, Chow.

469
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,154
<i>I hurt myself today</i>

470
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,192
<i>To see if I still feel</i>

471
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,236
<i>I focus on the pain</i>

472
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,755
<i>The only thing that's real</i>

473
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,357
<i>What have I become</i>

474
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,636
What the fuck am I watching?

475
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,793
<i>My sweetest friend</i>

476
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,750
<i>Everyone I know</i>

477
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,239
<i>Goes away in the end</i>

478
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,914
- Is that gonna be enough?
- Oh, yeah.

479
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,516
This will take about a minute to kick in.
We'll tell the waitress he's drunk.

480
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,875
By the time we get to the car,
he'll be out cold.

481
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,793
<i>My empire of dirt</i>

482
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,673
<i>I will let you down</i>

483
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,197
<i>I will make you hurt</i>

484
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,552
Alan, sit down.

485
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,159
That was really nice, Chow.

486
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,389
Thanks, Phil.

487
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,994
The key is to sing from your heart.

488
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,390
So Mexico, huh?
What are you doing down here?

489
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,348
You know, fucking, doing blow.
Same old, same old.

490
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,873
Ooh, I got into cockfighting.

491
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,554
- Oh, cockfighting. That sounds wonderful.
- Yes.

492
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,796
Basically, been killing it down here.

493
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,550
That is just terrific. Right?

494
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,473
I mean, that's terrific.
I think that calls for a toast.

495
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,834
I like that.

496
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,718
- To killing it.
- Killing it.

497
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,916
Yeah, to killing it.

498
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,513
You okay, Chow?

499
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,711
I don't know. You tell me.

500
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,755
So how many rooster birds do you have,
Chow?

501
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,280
- Act cool or I open his vein.
- Oh, my God.

502
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,198
Why you wanna drug poor Chow?

503
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,397
No, no. It's not what you think.
There's this guy Marshall.

504
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,596
Marshall? How you know that fat fuck?

505
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,469
He says you took his gold. He's got Doug.
He'll kill him unless we bring you back.

506
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,757
It's true! I swear to God, it's true!

507
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,476
Chow. Chow, that's the truth.

508
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,999
Goddamn it!

509
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,199
That motherfucker.

510
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,078
Stu, you okay?

511
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,639
- You all right?
- No.

512
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,553
We're sorry, Chow.

513
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,438
We're sorry.

514
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,433
- We didn't know what else to do.
- Next time, don't lie to Chow.

515
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,876
You're right. You are so right,
and we made a huge mistake.

516
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,838
So, what do we do now?

517
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,269
That depends.

518
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,113
Can I trust you?

519
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,151
What is this place, Chow?

520
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,753
My house.

521
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,710
Chow used to be on top of the world.

522
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,316
Had three beautiful homes
in three different countries.

523
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,554
But this one, my Mexican villa...

524
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,918
this was my favorite.

525
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,392
And everything got fucked.

526
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,152
Chow go to prison, all my property seized.

527
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,912
My homes...

528
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,196
sold at auction to highest bidders.

529
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,839
But I know something no one else knows.

530
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,554
This house is where I stashed the gold.

531
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,277
- Marshall's gold?
- Yep.

532
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,431
Hid it inside the basement wall.

533
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,037
No one knows it's there.

534
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,078
We're gonna go get it.

535
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,154
Wait. You mean break in?

536
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,868
Look, Marshall wants his gold.

537
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,634
And he's gonna hunt me down
until he gets it.

538
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,597
If we show up without it, he'll kill me.

539
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,637
We're not breaking in anywhere.

540
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,792
Not anywhere, Stu. My house.

541
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,712
It's piece of cake.

542
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,632
I know every square inch of this place.

543
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,591
The best part, the guy we're stealing it from
doesn't even know it's there.

544
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,916
So he'll never know it's gone.

545
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,038
You guys know what's going on, right?

546
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,795
What do you mean?

547
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,396
Well, and please correct me if I'm wrong,
we're not breaking into this house.

548
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,832
This house is too small.

549
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,798
We're breaking into another house.
This is just a model, right?

550
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,518
What? Alan, no!

551
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,599
My chickens!

552
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,354
Oh, shit!

553
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,509
Chow, what the fuck?

554
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,150
Watch out for the claws!
They're trained to kill!

555
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,436
His beak is so sharp!

556
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,395
- Oh, fuck!
- Stay still, I'm trying to help.

557
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,152
- Don't!
- Get it off!

558
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,353
- Fucking bull's-eye!
- Are you out of your mind?

559
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,715
Shoot it! Shoot it! Shoot it!

560
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,679
Stu, the window!

561
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,555
- Get it out!
- Okay, okay!

562
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,039
Get it out!

563
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,830
Don't struggle. Let go.

564
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,629
You won a lot of fights, Wallace.

565
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,749
Not this time.

566
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,674
- What the fuck is wrong with those chickens?
- They're angry.

567
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,637
All I feed them is cocaine.

568
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,039
And chicken.

569
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,999
That's some house, Chow.

570
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,789
It was my Shangri-La. Now it's gone.

571
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,872
Could you not spit inside my minivan,
please? Jesus.

572
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,515
Who lives there now?

573
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,194
Some dot-com millionaire. He's never here.

574
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,839
This is a vacation home.

575
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,718
The help doesn't show up on Sundays.

576
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,270
No one there but the guard dogs. Stu?

577
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,069
We'll toss these burgers over the gate,
wait for the Demerol to kick in.

578
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,549
Make sure you put in enough to kill them.

579
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,676
We're not gonna kill the dogs, Chow.

580
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,432
This will knock them out for hours.

581
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,795
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you worked for PETA.

582
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,251
What a pussy.

583
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,713
Alan, take that.

584
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,438
- Where are you going?
- You'll see.

585
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,079
Pardon me, little loser.

586
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,558
Excuse me, fucking asshole.

587
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,068
Follow me.

588
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,152
Okay, here's the deal,
two security panels inside.

589
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,880
If you cut only one wire, it triggers alarm.

590
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,996
Place will be crawling with cops.

591
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,436
But if you cut wire on both panels
at same time, alarm disabled.

592
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,558
Yeah, but how are we gonna get inside
without tripping the alarm?

593
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,358
Check this out.

594
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,456
Any more stupid questions?

595
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,433
Now, who's coming with me?

596
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,869
I'll do it.

597
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,389
You wanna tell him?

598
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,712
Alan, you're just too fat.

599
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,634
Roger that.

600
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,237
You kicked me, you motherfucker.

601
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,114
No, no, no. Don't get up.
Will trip motion detectors.

602
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,395
Stay low like dog.

603
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,437
Okay. Good idea.

604
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,349
- Which way?
- In there. The kitchen.

605
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,193
What the fuck is that?

606
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,511
I'm saying hello. We're dogs, remember?

607
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,195
Hey, Stu?

608
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,679
Check it out.

609
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,595
Oh, my God! So gross!

610
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,309
God! Chow, cut it out!

611
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,037
Okay, I'm here.

612
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,599
Now what?

613
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,910
Pull the cover off so you can see the wires.

614
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,069
Okay.

615
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,508
Okay. Done!

616
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,399
Okay, on three, cut the gray wire.

617
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,471
One, two....

618
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,709
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

619
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,348
I don't have a gray wire.
I have red, green and yellow.

620
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,229
That's weird. I have light gray,
medium gray, dark gray.

621
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,995
You do?

622
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,594
Motherfucker.

623
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,110
My bad. I'm colorblind.

624
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,269
You're what?

625
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,476
Fuck it, just cut the middle one.

626
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,798
No, my middle one could be different.
The wires are all twisted.

627
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,758
- On three. One, two...
- Chow, stop!

628
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,549
God.

629
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,036
Hold on, I'm coming to you.

630
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,872
What the fuck's taking them so long?

631
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,554
Where'd you get that shirt, the Diesel store?

632
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,714
Phil.

633
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,279
What?

634
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,309
It's a cute top. Where did you get that shirt?

635
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,514
What's the problem?

636
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,199
Just point to the wire you want me to cut.

637
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,476
- This gray one right here.
- Great.

638
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,517
For your information, that's green.

639
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,429
Which one's red?

640
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,636
The one in your left hand.

641
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,396
- Wait, which hand is that? I'm also dyslexic.
- What the fuck?

642
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,472
- Where'd you get it?
- I don't know. I'll find out, I'll get you one.

643
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,758
There's a cool Diesel store in the mall that
I like to go to. Right next to the food court.

644
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,797
I don't know if it's Diesel.

645
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,038
Looks like a Diesel.

646
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,634
What's the matter with you?

647
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,360
Okay, you're still holding
the one I left you with, right?

648
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,348
Pretty much.

649
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,433
Oh, fuck.

650
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,431
All right. On three!

651
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,629
One...

652
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,435
two...

653
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,389
three.

654
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,156
Holy shit, it worked.

655
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,235
All good?

656
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,712
- Easy peasy.
- All right.

657
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,995
You have no idea.

658
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,229
Come on.

659
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,677
Jesus, be careful, Chow.

660
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,478
Fuck this guy.

661
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,552
Living in my house. Living my life.

662
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,312
Can we just stick to the plan?

663
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,469
Fine.

664
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,596
Ruined.

665
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,838
He is completely out of control.

666
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,831
Let's just get this done.

667
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,634
This way. Come on, come on.

668
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,718
It's buried behind this wall.

669
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,628
- Alan.
- Here you go, boss.

670
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,469
Fuck!

671
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,676
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

672
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,432
Just warming up.

673
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,319
It's so heavy. Do we have a lighter one?

674
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,268
- Why don't you just let me do it, Chow?
- Okay. Either way, you or me. Same thing.

675
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,829
You might wanna take your shirt off.
Makes it easier.

676
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,878
- What?
- I've heard that too.

677
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,593
See that? Chow come back for you.

678
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,915
That's the last of it.

679
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,993
You sure?

680
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,316
- Yeah.
- You triple sure?

681
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,835
- Yes!
- Good!

682
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,429
Chow?

683
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,674
Chow?

684
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,389
Chow!

685
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,119
Chow!

686
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,834
Chow!

687
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,399
Chow!

688
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,033
Chow, open this fucking door right now!

689
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,993
Chow!

690
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,878
Stuart Price.

691
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,669
No felonies. One arrest.

692
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,829
Las Vegas, Nevada.

693
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,155
Phil Wenneck.

694
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,151
No felonies. One arrest.

695
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,675
Also Las Vegas, Nevada.

696
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,878
Alan Garner.

697
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,279
Is this record accurate?

698
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,592
I did that.

699
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,159
Yeah.

700
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,311
Masturbating on a city bus.
Yep, that was me.

701
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,277
Look, we've been here for 5 hours.

702
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,271
We already told your guys everything.

703
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,429
No.

704
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,068
You told them a story
about a little Chinese man.

705
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,708
Leslie Chow. He's an international criminal.
Look it up.

706
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,633
A little Chinese man that no one in town
has seen or heard of.

707
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,155
The hotel where you say he's staying?
No one there.

708
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,276
Probably because he left town.

709
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,273
That's one theory.

710
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,112
Another theory is that you're lying.

711
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,277
Lewd behavior, Cracker Barrel,
Christmas Eve.

712
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,309
Excuse me.

713
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,917
We're fucking dead.

714
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,433
Why would Mr. Chow do this?

715
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,277
Because he's a greedy piece of shit
who used us.

716
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,000
Yeah, but he's our friend.

717
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,873
Grow up, Alan.

718
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,475
You're free to leave.

719
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,790
All the charges have been dropped.

720
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,555
By who?

721
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,119
It's your lucky day.

722
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,236
There's a car waiting for you out front.

723
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,031
Come on, let's go.

724
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,552
Oh, Jesus.

725
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,235
What?

726
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,833
I'm sorry.

727
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,149
What is this?

728
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,428
Get in the car.

729
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,673
Excuse me, sir?

730
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,069
Where we headed?

731
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,719
Welcome back.

732
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,433
- What the fuck?
- Let's go, guys.

733
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,078
Out to the back.

734
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,950
- Doug?
- Guys. Careful.

735
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,678
Get your ass back over here.

736
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,671
Leslie Chow never lived here.

737
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,789
You didn't break into his old house.

738
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,872
You broke into my house.

739
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,149
I don't understand.

740
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,990
You didn't get back the gold
he stole from me.

741
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,710
You got the other half that he didn't.

742
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,552
Oh, my God!

743
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,995
What, you mean the half he never had?

744
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,993
He's a world-class rat,
and you three were his accomplices.

745
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,149
- No!
- We had no idea.

746
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,834
We were trying to help you.
We thought you'd be happy!

747
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,831
Thank you so much.

748
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,434
Thank you for ripping me off.

749
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,397
Thank you for desecrating my home!

750
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,279
And thank you for killing my fucking dogs!

751
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,715
We didn't kill your dogs.
They're just tranquilized.

752
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,713
Oh, right.

753
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,395
You don't know.

754
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,393
- Chow snapped their necks on his way out.
- What?

755
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,154
And somebody's gotta pay.

756
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,155
- He's right.
- No, no, no!

757
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,590
My head of security.

758
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,719
Couldn't stop three fuckups and
a Chinaman with a pair of wire cutters.

759
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,269
Unreal.

760
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,073
Man.

761
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,756
That's okay. I know it's scary.

762
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,276
Hector. Run upstairs and grab a pair
of sweatpants for Alan here.

763
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,154
I'm a 44 slim.

764
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,790
Can you bring me a few options?

765
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,638
You found Chow once. Find him again.

766
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,994
And my gold.

767
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,075
Wait.

768
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,312
We don't even have a car.
Chow stole my minivan.

769
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,994
Take the limo. Hector has the keys.

770
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,832
And get going.

771
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,436
I'm killing Dougs today.

772
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,310
- I never saw anyone get killed before.
- Right?

773
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,436
My God, that was so intense.

774
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,319
I mean, he just fell and then he's dead.

775
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,595
I feel sick.

776
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,988
Me too.

777
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,760
Well, maybe we should
get some food, guys.

778
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,554
What are we gonna do?
We have no idea where Chow is.

779
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,312
I don't know.

780
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,755
He took your minivan.
We could report it stolen...

781
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,672
and then they could track him down?

782
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,719
It's worth a shot.

783
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,198
Oh, fuck!

784
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,839
I left my phone in the minivan.

785
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,318
Well, if you lost your phone, Phil,
I have that Find My Phone app.

786
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,391
We have bigger problems than that, Alan.

787
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,949
No, wait, wait, wait.
If your phone's in the minivan...

788
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,680
and Chow has the minivan,
then your phone's with Chow!

789
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,479
You heard him.
We have bigger problems than that, Stu.

790
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,517
Alan, give me your phone. Quick.

791
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,517
- That's brilliant.
- Yes.

792
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,631
- Wait, what's your password?
- Hey Phil.

793
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,994
- Yeah?
- No, that's it.

794
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,354
- What?
- That's my password.

795
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,635
Hey Phil.

796
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,234
It is it.

797
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,828
Phil gets it.

798
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,560
Nothing worse than losing your phone.

799
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,277
You just saw a man get murdered.
Your brother-in-law is kidnapped.

800
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,873
You sure there's nothing worse?

801
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,758
You don't get it, Stu.

802
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,469
You just don't get it, do you?

803
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,279
I have over 60 apps on that phone.

804
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,112
What if I lost my phone?

805
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,670
Do you have any idea how much time
and man-hours it would take...

806
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,478
to re-download those apps?

807
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,558
You are right.
I had not thought of that. Thank you.

808
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,790
Oh, God, it's not always about you, Stu!

809
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,758
It's locating.

810
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,515
- Oh, God, of course.
- What?

811
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,228
Where is he?

812
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,799
He's in fucking Vegas.

813
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,315
Shotgun.

814
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,637
Oh, no.

815
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,758
Hey, Stu?

816
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,519
I don't enjoy talking to you that way.

817
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,956
I don't know why you insist
on making me blow my top.

818
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,675
We've been on
a lot of adventures together...

819
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,115
but it seems like you haven't
learned anything.

820
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,599
Anything!

821
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,909
You think on it.

822
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,598
I'll be in the limo.

823
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,038
He's okay.

824
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,273
Someone needs to burn this place
to the ground.

825
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,998
I told myself I would never come back.

826
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,712
Well, don't worry.

827
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,836
It all ends tonight.

828
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,038
It says 200 yards up on the right.

829
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,471
And there it is.

830
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,959
Amazing.

831
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,472
Looks like he ditched it.

832
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,958
- It's open.
- No shit.

833
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,678
Well, look around.

834
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,956
Let's see if he left anything in here.

835
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,153
- I found the Demerol.
- Good. Keep it, we're gonna need it.

836
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,596
I got my phone. No fucking keys though.

837
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,752
- Alan, anything?
- No, not even the gold.

838
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,030
- Why the fuck would Chow come down here?
- I know, right?

839
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,675
Why here?

840
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,199
You can't match
the pure strength and power...

841
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,839
of John Cena!

842
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,311
Cena puts Punk down!

843
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,799
Nice!

844
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,750
Excuse me.
Have you happened to see the driver...

845
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,354
of that minivan that's out front?
Short Asian guy?

846
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,748
Yeah, they're all short.

847
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,434
That's so true.

848
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,354
Right, but he may have been trying
to pawn some gold.

849
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,472
That would be my business, wouldn't it?

850
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,552
I like your T-shirt.

851
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,870
I saw that show at the Forum.

852
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,352
He played Captain Jack.

853
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,992
Yeah, I heard that was legendary.

854
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,559
Woman...

855
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,312
you have no idea.

856
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,913
Try me.

857
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,635
Cassie, I'm hungry.
I thought you ordered Chinese.

858
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,559
Mom, I'm with a customer!

859
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,393
- You'll eat when I say it's time to eat!
- But the doctor...

860
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,313
If you don't reverse that right now,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

861
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,029
She's rude.

862
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,474
Thank you.

863
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,710
Yeah, you hear that, Ma? Nobody likes you!

864
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,108
Yeah, keep your mouth shut!

865
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,033
You're smart.

866
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,355
A Chinese guy came in here earlier.

867
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,112
It was pretty weird.

868
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,032
He pawned a gold brick.

869
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,589
The thing's worth 400 grand,
he took 18,000.

870
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,753
- Did he say where he was going?
- I'm sorry, was I talking to you?

871
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,953
He said he wanted three things.

872
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,998
He wanted some girls,
some guys and some bath salts.

873
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,755
I gave him a card for an escort service
and he took off.

874
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,194
Pretty high-end,
so good luck getting anything out of them.

875
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,152
Thank you.

876
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,079
We gotta go. We should go.

877
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,832
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

878
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,911
I'll get it, I'll get it. I'll get it.

879
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,709
Anything?

880
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,313
No, I'm still on hold.

881
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,115
Oh, look how happy this fucking guy is.

882
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,795
Have you ever witnessed a moment
with that much heat?

883
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,951
I mean, white-hot heat, bro!

884
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,829
No, it was pretty intense.

885
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,069
Yeah!

886
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,478
Yeah, it's actually an emergency.

887
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,995
He has a thick Asian accent.

888
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,433
I totally get it...

889
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,319
but this is a highly unusual circumstance
and...

890
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,357
Okay. All right.

891
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,269
It's an escort service.

892
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,158
They're not gonna tell us shit.

893
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,753
Maybe an escort would.

894
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,432
- You still have her number?
- Yeah, but...

895
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,192
it'd be pretty awkward.

896
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,718
It's all we got.

897
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,077
She smiled at me again,
from inside the shop.

898
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,717
This is the best day of my life.

899
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,708
Hey!

900
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,632
Oh, my God, you guys.

901
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,950
It's been so long.

902
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,752
- Come in, come in.
- Thank you.

903
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,559
- You look great.
- So do you! You're pregnant.

904
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,955
I feel so fat.

905
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,109
Oh, please.

906
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,794
Do you guys mind taking your shoes off?
I'm a germ freak.

907
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,234
- Yeah, sure.
- Of course.

908
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,629
Alan.

909
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,711
Alan, what are you doing?

910
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,755
Sorry.

911
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,710
- Wow, you have a great house.
- Thank you.

912
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,075
I got married a year ago to a surgeon.

913
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,674
- Another doctor, can you believe it?
- Another doctor.

914
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,757
His name's Jeff. You guys would love him.

915
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,078
Tyler, say hi to Mommy's friends.

916
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,509
Hi.

917
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,795
- Hey.
- Hey.

918
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,550
Wait, is that the baby?

919
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,994
Yeah, time flies, huh?

920
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,597
Jade is there a place we could talk
that's a little bit more private?

921
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,751
Let's go in the kitchen.
You guys want coffee?

922
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,989
Perfect.

923
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,958
Hey, you coming?

924
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,315
Is it okay if I go say hello
to the little guy?

925
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,993
Of course.

926
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,189
Nice stuff.

927
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,029
Thanks. Jeff bought it for me.

928
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,076
Jeff. Who's that, your fake dad?

929
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,114
Your name was Carlos once.

930
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,759
Did you know that?

931
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,035
No.

932
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,599
Well, it was.

933
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,109
And, frankly, it suits you better.

934
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,349
Okay.

935
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,718
Do you remember me?

936
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,079
No.

937
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,789
Are you my real dad?

938
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,709
Yes.

939
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,634
I don't know. You gotta understand,
I've been out of that world a few years now.

940
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,075
Yeah, of course. We totally get that.

941
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,959
I mean, Jeff knows everything
and he's cool, but...

942
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,111
We're just asking if you can call around...

943
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,510
just find out if anybody
might know where he is.

944
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,229
We could really use your help.

945
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,039
You used to love it
when I would carry you around.

946
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,953
Sometimes I can still feel your little head
on my chest.

947
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,996
So do you like this new Jeff guy?

948
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,998
Yeah, he's nice.

949
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,913
My dad was nice too.
We did everything together.

950
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,916
He was my life partner, heh.

951
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,878
I really let him down.

952
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,871
Okay.

953
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,675
Just trust me, you don't want to go
over there, okay? Not this one.

954
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,273
I love you too.

955
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,117
She says there's this crazy Chinese guy...

956
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,033
and he's holed up in the penthouse suite
of Caesars Palace.

957
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,760
There's girls going in and out,
drugs everywhere....

958
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,956
It sounds like a bad scene.

959
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,758
Hey, Alan?

960
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,633
We gotta go.

961
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,159
I gotta go, little man.

962
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,038
It was great talking to you.

963
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,474
High five.

964
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,517
- It's great to see you.
- You too, Jade.

965
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,557
- Thanks so much for your help.
- Yeah.

966
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,199
That's a great kid you got there.

967
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,713
He is the best.

968
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,108
Alan.

969
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,511
Oh, hold on. I have something for you.

970
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,189
Perfect.

971
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,509
Oh, please.

972
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,910
I'll see you around, Carlos.

973
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,671
- Yeah.
- We got him.

974
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,513
- Great. Where is he?
- Caesars Palace.

975
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,989
Change of plans.
Tell him we're going to Vegas.

976
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,953
I'm on my way.

977
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,712
There's a spot just outside of town.

978
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,599
I'll text you the details. Be there at 6 a.m.

979
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,751
And make sure the little fucker's tied up.

980
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,114
We don't have him.

981
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,918
Hey, Marshall, it's Phil.

982
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,195
Maybe Stu wasn't clear.

983
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,238
We don't actually have Chow,
we just know where he is.

984
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,675
Yeah, and we were hoping
that you and your guys...

985
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,594
- could go to Caesars and get him.
- I don't give a fuck what you were hoping.

986
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,512
The deal is you bring Chow to me.

987
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,911
- Oh, fuck.
- 6 a.m. or your friend is dead.

988
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,635
Shit.

989
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,597
Oh, God.

990
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,358
This place gives me the chills.

991
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,358
I know, right?

992
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,756
It's great to be back.

993
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,275
- So many good memories.
- Are you kidding me?

994
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,119
Okay, so here's the deal.

995
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,271
You need a key just to get onto his floor.

996
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,398
And then once you're there,
he's got security posted at the door.

997
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,993
It's ridiculous.

998
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,037
Let me guess, that's him?

999
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,760
Yep. The one with the strobe lights.

1000
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,472
I got an idea.

1001
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,592
But you're not gonna like it.

1002
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,679
It's not gonna work.

1003
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,558
Not with that fucking attitude.

1004
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,588
You know this whole place
is made out of marbles?

1005
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,476
Come on. Go, go, go.

1006
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,151
After we stick Chow, Alan and I are
gonna take him down through the lobby.

1007
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,676
Be waiting in valet.
Engine running, ready to go.

1008
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,432
Are you sure about this?

1009
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,749
Give me the Demerol.

1010
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,395
See you in 20 minutes.

1011
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:20,595
- Hey, Phil?
- Yeah?

1012
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,749
Don't die.

1013
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,714
All right.

1014
01:05:58,680 --> 01:05:59,908
Are you ready to do this?

1015
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,479
Yeah.

1016
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,319
Wait, what are we doing?

1017
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,478
Holy shit.

1018
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:17,914
We're gonna climb down...

1019
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,752
and then it's about an 8-foot drop
to the balcony.

1020
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,397
- All right?
- Yeah.

1021
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,353
No, you spit in your own hand.

1022
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,114
Oh, yeah.

1023
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,878
Dry desert air.

1024
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,874
- Alan, it's fine. You don't need it.
- Okay.

1025
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:05,879
Oh, God.

1026
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,317
Careful!

1027
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,154
- Phil!
- I'm all right.

1028
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,394
I'm okay!

1029
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,718
- Hey, Phil.
- What's wrong?

1030
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:23,949
Hold on a second.

1031
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,348
- What?
- Hold on!

1032
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,636
Like, kick yourself out a little bit.

1033
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:28,835
Alan.

1034
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,274
- Stay still!
- Alan!

1035
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,635
Did you get it?

1036
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,711
No. Hold on.

1037
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,676
Ha, that's cool.

1038
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,279
Oh! Fuck me!

1039
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,753
Everything all right?

1040
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,159
It's okay!

1041
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,514
It's all right!

1042
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,050
I got it!

1043
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:01,669
Are you okay?

1044
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,553
Alan, it's your turn.

1045
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,519
That's it.

1046
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,153
Phil, I can't. I can't.

1047
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,309
Come on.

1048
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,068
Alan, you all right?

1049
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,434
Phil, call Security!

1050
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,438
- I think it's slipping!
- Just hold on!

1051
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:36,995
Oh! God!

1052
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,071
- You need to calm down.
- I'm slipping, Phil!

1053
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,594
Oh! Fuck!

1054
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,871
Oh, shit! You okay?

1055
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,231
Help!

1056
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,159
Oh, no.

1057
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,592
I'm gonna die, Phil.

1058
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,194
No, you're fine. Just....

1059
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,032
Drop down to me.

1060
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,789
No chance.

1061
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,919
I'm good up here.

1062
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,674
Alan, you can do this. I'll catch you.

1063
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,948
Just...

1064
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,395
let go.

1065
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:27,069
That's it. That's it. Just drop straight down.

1066
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,635
But don't push off.

1067
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,669
No!

1068
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,352
- Oh, God!
- Come here!

1069
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,273
Holy fuck!

1070
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,674
You okay?

1071
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,829
Yeah.

1072
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,116
Shit. Oh, fuck.

1073
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,278
I almost died, Phil.

1074
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,430
Come on. I wasn't gonna let you go.
You're my boy.

1075
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,831
And you're my man.

1076
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,031
Alan, what are you doing? Alan.

1077
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,388
Okay.

1078
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,077
Let's go get this fucker.

1079
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,029
Hey!

1080
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:26,629
Have you seen my...?

1081
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,513
Phil!

1082
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:56,959
Motherfuckers!

1083
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:58,949
Grab the gun!

1084
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,958
- Oh, fuck!
- Phil!

1085
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,679
Phil, you okay?

1086
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,155
Chow!

1087
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,429
Chow!

1088
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,678
Chow, open the fucking door!

1089
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,474
Fuck.

1090
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,595
Chow, stop.

1091
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,749
You motherfuckers!

1092
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,957
Leslie, get down from there! Please!
You're gonna hurt yourself!

1093
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,519
Nothing hurts Chow.

1094
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,477
I am invisible!

1095
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,755
It's invincible, and you're not.
You're just out of your fucking mind.

1096
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,990
Now get down from there before you die!

1097
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,513
Die?

1098
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:49,958
How do you kill what's already dead?

1099
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,709
Oh, fuck!

1100
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,712
Holy....

1101
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,712
- Hey. You okay?
- No.

1102
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:04,995
Look up.

1103
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,517
What the fuck is that?

1104
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,272
- That's Chow!
- What?

1105
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:11,793
Follow him.

1106
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,517
I love cocaine!

1107
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,474
Out of the way!

1108
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,909
How did this happen?

1109
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,911
We had him trapped, and then he jumped!

1110
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,559
He's out of his fucking mind!

1111
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,075
I'm out of my fucking mind!

1112
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:43,315
So beautiful.

1113
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,868
Stu, do not lose him.

1114
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,189
I'm trying.

1115
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,077
Oh, shit.

1116
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,796
<i>I believe I can fly</i>

1117
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,112
<i>I believe I can touch the sky</i>

1118
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,599
<i>Think about it every night and day</i>

1119
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,388
We gotta pack up all this gold.
We're taking it with us.

1120
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,993
Talk to me, Stu.

1121
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,513
I got him.

1122
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,795
I got him!

1123
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,435
Oh, shit!

1124
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,793
Shit.

1125
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,757
Fuck! I lost him!

1126
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,911
Don't tell me that. You can't lose him!

1127
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,469
This is so much harder
than you realize, Phil.

1128
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,119
I'm just a dentist!

1129
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,792
No, Stu, you're a fucking doctor.
Now go get him.

1130
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,590
Where the fuck did he go?

1131
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,477
Fuck me!

1132
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,517
I should have thought this through!

1133
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,875
Shit!

1134
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,235
Move!

1135
01:13:58,740 --> 01:13:59,519
Stu?

1136
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,750
- Chow?
- Stop the fucking car!

1137
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,753
- Stu.
- I can't! The pedal is stuck!

1138
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,114
- What?
- Stu?

1139
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,392
- I can't see!
- Stop, motherfucker!

1140
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,598
- Get off!
- Pull over!

1141
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,002
It won't stop!

1142
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,192
Get off the car!

1143
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,952
I can't see anything!

1144
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,519
We're gonna die finally.

1145
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,198
Holy shit.

1146
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,118
Stu? Stu, what happened?

1147
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,317
Stu, what's going on?

1148
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,109
We had an accident, and I think he's dead.

1149
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,594
Wait, what?

1150
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,716
I think I killed him.

1151
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,479
Holy shit.

1152
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,233
He's not moving.

1153
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,913
Oh, fuck.

1154
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,153
Mr. Chow?

1155
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,759
Chow.

1156
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,229
Stuart?

1157
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,918
He's alive. He's okay.

1158
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,195
Oh, great.

1159
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,113
Put him in the limo and come get us.
We'll meet you at valet.

1160
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,508
Yeah, okay.

1161
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,749
Stu.

1162
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,312
That was some ride, huh, pal?

1163
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,234
Yeah, it was pretty wild.

1164
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,311
I can't feel my nuts.

1165
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,680
Would you rub them
and make sure they okay?

1166
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,151
It's over, Leslie.

1167
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,435
Wait.

1168
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,512
Let's make a deal.

1169
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,116
Want Chow to blow your dick?

1170
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,074
Come on, Stu.

1171
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,395
I could be a good wife to you.

1172
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,271
- No more deals.
- No, wait!

1173
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,671
Let's put the bags in the back seat.

1174
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,239
Trunk's full.

1175
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,111
Hey, guys? I'm feeling better now.

1176
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,551
All right, it's the next exit,
then four miles straight into the desert.

1177
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,159
Tell you what.

1178
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:44,949
Let me out, we split the gold four ways.
Everyone wins.

1179
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,470
Marshall gonna kill me!

1180
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,471
My blood will be on your hands!

1181
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,550
You want Chow's ghost haunting you
for rest of your life, Stu?

1182
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,995
Floating over you while you make fuck
on your wife?

1183
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,879
He's not gonna kill you, Chow!
He just wants his gold back!

1184
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,999
It's gone.
I blew the first 20 million in Bangkok.

1185
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:08,675
- That's why I had to get the other half.
- Enough, Chow! It's over!

1186
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,319
You motherfucker!

1187
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,472
When I get out of this,
I'm gonna rip out your fucking lungs!

1188
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,473
You hear me? You're dead! You're all dead!

1189
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,637
I didn't mean that.

1190
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,155
Chow loses temper sometimes.

1191
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,959
Please. I need help.

1192
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,314
I know that now.

1193
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,195
That's the exit.

1194
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,678
They're here.

1195
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,435
Alan, they're coming, grab the last bag.

1196
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,158
Please, Alan.

1197
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,235
Doug!

1198
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,118
Step away from the bags. Let's go!

1199
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,109
We good?

1200
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,271
- It's all there. I promise.
- Not exactly.

1201
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,635
I'm still missing the original half.

1202
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:42,316
But, no, that's all we have. Chow said
he blew the other half in Bangkok.

1203
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,994
Where is he?

1204
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,719
He's in the trunk.

1205
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,748
Deal's a deal.

1206
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,716
- Doug.
- Give me the keys.

1207
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,399
What are you gonna do with Chow?

1208
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,751
I just wanna talk to him.

1209
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,629
Move.

1210
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,679
You all right?

1211
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,713
What the fuck?

1212
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,636
End of conversation.

1213
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,636
Why would you do that?

1214
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,758
Leslie Chow is madness.

1215
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,718
You don't talk to madness.

1216
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,634
If you're lucky, you trap it in the trunk
of your limo and you kill it.

1217
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,276
You did a great thing tonight.

1218
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,636
You should feel good about this.

1219
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,838
What the fuck?
You think this is a fucking game?

1220
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:44,709
Don't, don't, don't!

1221
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,108
Oh, shit!

1222
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,791
Toodle-loo, motherfuckers.

1223
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,109
Chow.

1224
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,516
Chow. Chow, wait.

1225
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,830
Oh, now you wanna talk, blue eyes?

1226
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,951
No more silent treatment?

1227
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,917
Leslie. No.

1228
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,759
Stay out of this, fatty.

1229
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,353
No, Leslie.

1230
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,510
You shoot Phil, you gotta go through me.

1231
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:25,955
What?

1232
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,071
- Alan.
- Quiet.

1233
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,071
I'm in a stare-off.

1234
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:46,799
Today you all live.

1235
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,035
Because one of you was a friend.

1236
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,591
Alan, what did you do?

1237
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,317
I unlocked the latch
between the back seat and the trunk.

1238
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,871
And left him his gun?

1239
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:04,876
Yeah, I didn't think it all the way through.

1240
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,231
He gave Chow a fighting chance.

1241
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,598
That's all I ever need.

1242
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,268
Fat fuck.

1243
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:21,748
It's never easy, is it?

1244
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,759
No one wants to see that.

1245
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,634
Except for me, but I was born bad.

1246
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,115
Hold on. I have something for you.

1247
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:32,829
For your loyalty.

1248
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:40,950
- Oh, no, I don't want this, Mr. Chow.
- Okay, give it back then. Come on.

1249
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,994
Quick! Before Stu smells it.

1250
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,519
I don't want it either, Chow.

1251
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,716
Oh, please.
Like a squirrel doesn't want a nut.

1252
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,880
It funny because he's Jewish.

1253
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,159
Don't you get it?

1254
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,958
Goddamn it.

1255
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,912
Okay, go on. Get out of here, all of you.

1256
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:19,077
Hey, chubster, I'll call you in a week.
We'll get together.

1257
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:26,150
No, Leslie, we can't be friends anymore.

1258
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,355
What?

1259
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:31,080
You're not good for me. It's not healthy.

1260
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,993
Alan, you're not thinking straight.

1261
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,233
Let's just talk tomorrow.

1262
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,113
Leslie, you're one of the coolest
and nicest guys I've ever met.

1263
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:43,317
And you're smart and you're funny
and everybody loves you.

1264
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:45,277
Alan. What is this?

1265
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,878
When we get together,
bad things happen and people get hurt.

1266
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,873
Yeah, that's the point. It's funny.

1267
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,917
Well, I've gotta make some changes
in my life, and this is one of them.

1268
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,399
I'm sorry.

1269
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,352
Farewell, Leslie Chow.

1270
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,798
You're cold as ice.

1271
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:24,909
Shotgun.

1272
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,552
Everybody okay?

1273
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,559
Yeah.

1274
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:32,276
Alan, you okay?

1275
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:34,399
Yeah.

1276
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,670
Good. Let's go home.

1277
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,432
Jesus Christ.

1278
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,479
You know what, guys?

1279
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:10,358
You can go ahead without me.
There's something I need to do.

1280
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,271
Do you even know how to get home?

1281
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:18,191
Of course I do. I'm a grown man.

1282
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,918
I'll ask a stranger.

1283
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:24,869
Good luck, Alan.

1284
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,992
We'll see you soon.

1285
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,753
Did you know that just a couple blocks
from here...

1286
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,798
there's a place that looks exactly
like Paris, France?

1287
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:10,229
I can't remember what it's called,
but it's supposed to be magnificent.

1288
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:13,073
It's called Paris Hotel and Casino,
and it is magnificent.

1289
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,269
Yeah, that's it.

1290
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:17,352
Well, I'd like to take you to dinner there.
Tonight.

1291
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,916
Oh, sorry. No can do.

1292
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:21,988
Oh, well....

1293
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:24,276
I'm banned from the casino for life.

1294
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,032
Plus 10 years.

1295
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,353
I took Mom there for her birthday,
played a little blackjack.

1296
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:30,509
She split 10s.

1297
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:32,636
I may have overreacted.

1298
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,518
They said it was abuse of an elderly.

1299
01:26:34,999 --> 01:26:36,079
I've done that.

1300
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:38,310
Right? Whatever.

1301
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,319
I can't go back there.

1302
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,074
But...

1303
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:49,870
Golden Nugget has the best prime rib
in town, if that's....

1304
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,077
Well, that sounds glorious.

1305
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,439
I'll send for you at 8:00.

1306
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,478
Is that it?

1307
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,550
I saw it once in a pornography.

1308
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,879
It's a nice gesture.

1309
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,473
But maybe we should wait.

1310
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:48,995
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

1311
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,479
I'll see you at 8.

1312
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,277
You look great, Alan.

1313
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,550
What do you think? Hat or no hat?

1314
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,190
- Hat. For sure.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

1315
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,470
Who's this guy?

1316
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:35,710
The vest and the cane? I love it.

1317
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,711
Thank you. Cassie picked it out for me.

1318
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,279
You look like Mr. Peanut.

1319
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,874
Yeah, I know, right?
That's what I was going for.

1320
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,590
- Maybe we'll just lose it.
- Yeah.

1321
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:47,638
Hey, Alan, I was just talking to Cassie.
She's an amazing woman.

1322
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,274
Oh, thank you for saying that.
She is an amazing woman.

1323
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,271
I find her much better than your wives.

1324
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,634
That's sweet.

1325
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:57,236
Which reminds me.
We need to talk. Doug?

1326
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,312
All right, listen, fellas.

1327
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:05,189
Now that I'm getting married, I'm gonna be
spending a lot more time with Cassandra.

1328
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:08,875
- Yeah. It's the way it should be.
- No, you slow your roll, Phil, okay?

1329
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,029
There's more.

1330
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,077
And you're not gonna like this part.

1331
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:17,789
I must resign from the wolf pack.

1332
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:23,592
Wow, that's a big step, Alan.

1333
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:24,749
I know.

1334
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,077
But she's my soul mate.

1335
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:28,958
And my new best friend.

1336
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,229
Plus, she lets me mount her...

1337
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:33,908
which relaxes me.

1338
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:35,235
Oh, my God.

1339
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,312
Alan, maybe never say that part again.

1340
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,391
Chillax, Doug, we're all adults here.

1341
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,915
I know you mount my sister.
I've seen it. Many times.

1342
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,674
What?

1343
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,269
Alan, you are the best.

1344
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,634
The point is.

1345
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,034
You need to let me go.

1346
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,753
You in particular.

1347
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,512
I can't be your hero anymore.

1348
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:55,757
Okay. Sure.

1349
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,634
Having said all that...

1350
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,712
I still would like to get together
on Tuesdays for bowling...

1351
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:08,917
and alternating Sundays
for general horseplay.

1352
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:11,753
- How about we play all that by ear?
- Alan, it's time.

1353
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,069
Here we go.

1354
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,039
Ready?

1355
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:22,754
I'm ready.

1356
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:07,678
What the fuck?

1357
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:20,193
Oh, my God.

1358
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:21,954
You guys.

1359
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,350
We're so crazy.

1360
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:28,096
I'm wearing women's underwear.

1361
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,000
Oh, my God.

1362
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:34,678
Stu, don't freak out,
but you need to look down.

1363
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,153
What?

1364
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,038
Oh, my God!

1365
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,798
Oh, fuck!

1366
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,550
I have boobies now!

1367
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:53,709
Holy shit!

1368
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:55,154
It's not funny!

1369
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,116
Alan, what did you do?

1370
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,678
What did you do, Alan?

1371
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,273
The wedding cake.

1372
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:03,589
It was from Leslie.

1373
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:06,435
Oh, my God.

1374
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,098
We had a sick night, bitches.
