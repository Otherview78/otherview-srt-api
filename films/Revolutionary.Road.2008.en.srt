2
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,248
- So what do you do?
- I'm studying to be an actress. You?

3
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:48,709
I'm a longshoreman.

4
00:01:48,814 --> 00:01:52,296
- No, I mean, really.
- I mean, really, too.

5
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:55,257
Although starting Monday,
I'm doing something more glamorous.

6
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:59,637
- What's that?
- Night cashier at a cafeteria.

7
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:05,601
I don't mean how do you make money.
I mean, what are you interested in?

8
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:08,020
Honey, if I had the answer to that one…

9
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:11,545
I bet I'd bore us both
to death in half an hour.

10
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:53,712
Thank God that's over.

11
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:59,029
So much for the debut of
the Laurel Players.

12
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:02,137
And she was very disappointing.

13
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:13,377
- Frank! Very nice, Frank.
- Thanks so much, Mrs. Givings.

14
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:15,462
I can't tell you how much we enjoyed it.

15
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:19,238
- You have a very talented wife.
- I'll pass it along.

16
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,271
Frank!

17
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:34,523
Hi!

18
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:37,651
She's in there.
I'm about ready for that drink!

19
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:39,216
Couple of minutes.

20
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:51,895
April? Sweetheart?

21
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:56,837
- Hi.
- Hi.

22
00:03:56,942 --> 00:03:58,672
- About ready to leave?
- Yeah.

23
00:03:58,777 --> 00:04:01,029
I just have to get this makeup off.

24
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:12,582
Well, I guess it wasn't
a triumph or anything, was it?

25
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:17,524
I guess not.

26
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:21,341
- I'll be ready in a minute.
- Take your time.

27
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,448
Listen, will you do me a favor?

28
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:28,702
Milly and Shep wanted us
to go out with them.

29
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:32,163
Will you say we can't? Say it's
because the babysitter or something.

30
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:34,624
The thing is, I said we could.

31
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:36,376
I just saw them and I said that we would.

32
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:38,549
Then would you mind go out
and saying you were mistaken?

33
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,713
That's simple enough.

34
00:04:39,818 --> 00:04:41,677
Don't you think
that's a little bit rude, April?

35
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:42,803
Then I'll tell them myself.

36
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:47,492
Okay, take it easy,
alright? I'll tell them.

37
00:05:28,283 --> 00:05:31,598
Well, I mean it, baby. You were
the only person in that play.

38
00:05:31,703 --> 00:05:33,204
Thank you.

39
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,605
We just shouldn't have let you
get mixed up in the damn thing.

40
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,650
- All right.
- A bunch of amateurs.

41
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:44,652
I mean, you studied, for Christ's sakes.

42
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:47,469
- Could we stop talking about it now?
- Sure.

43
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:51,618
I just don't want you
feeling bad, that's all.

44
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:53,786
Because it's not worth it, you know.

45
00:05:53,892 --> 00:05:57,332
Bad enough having to live
out here amongst these people…

46
00:05:57,437 --> 00:05:58,875
- What did you say?
- I said, "Yes."

47
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,462
All right, Frank. Could you just stop
talking about it now…

48
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:05,028
before you drive me crazy? Please.

49
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,909
What are you doing?

50
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:23,316
April, sweetheart,
let's talk about this, okay?

51
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:25,818
- Please don't do that.
- Come on.

52
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:27,862
- Don't touch me.
- April…

53
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:30,637
Would you just leave me alone?

54
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:41,125
Okay. It strikes me…

55
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,462
that there's a considerable amount
of bullshit going on here…

56
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,548
and it just a few things
that I'd like to clear up. All right?

57
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:52,386
Number one, it's not my fault
the play was lousy, okay?

58
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:54,805
Number two, it sure as hell
isn't my fault…

59
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:56,974
that you didn't turn out to be an actress.

60
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,435
The sooner you get over
that little piece of soap opera…

61
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,899
the better off we're both going to be.

62
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,564
Number three,
I don't happen to fit the role…

63
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:06,567
of dumb insensitive suburban husband.

64
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:09,695
You've been trying to lay that crap
on me ever since we moved here.

65
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,989
And I'll be damned if I'll wear it!
Number four…

66
00:07:12,095 --> 00:07:13,346
April!

67
00:07:15,223 --> 00:07:16,724
April!

68
00:07:18,226 --> 00:07:19,997
April!

69
00:07:20,102 --> 00:07:22,003
What the hell are you doing?
Get back in the car!

70
00:07:22,104 --> 00:07:25,795
No. I will in a minute.
Just let me stand here for a second.

71
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,652
God damn it.

72
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:34,678
April, can you please just get back
in the car and talk about this…

73
00:07:34,784 --> 00:07:36,305
instead of running all over Route 12?

74
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,895
Haven't I made it clear I don't
particularly want to talk about it?

75
00:07:38,996 --> 00:07:40,935
Okay. I mean, Jesus,
I'm trying to be nice…

76
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,978
about this thing here, for God's sake.

77
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:46,065
How kind of you!
How terribly, terribly kind of you!

78
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,611
Wait a minute. I don't deserve this!

79
00:07:47,713 --> 00:07:49,235
You're always so wonderfully definite…

80
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,199
on the subject of what you do
and don't deserve.

81
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,031
Wait a minute! Wait a god damn…

82
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:56,992
April, now you listen to me!
This is one time…

83
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:00,120
you're not get away with twisting
everything I say, April!

84
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:02,373
This just happens to be
one goddamn time.

85
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:03,999
I know I'm not in the wrong here!

86
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:05,213
Christ, I wish you'd stayed home tonight.

87
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:07,090
You know what you are
when you're like this, April?

88
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:09,213
You're sick. I really mean that.
You're sick.

89
00:08:09,318 --> 00:08:11,048
- And you know what you are?
- What?

90
00:08:11,153 --> 00:08:12,508
- You're disgusting!
- Yeah?

91
00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:13,759
You don't fool me, Frank.

92
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:16,011
Just because you've got me safely
in this little trap…

93
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:18,059
you think you can bully me
into feeling whatever you want!

94
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,016
- You in a trap!
- Yes, Frank, me!

95
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:23,852
Jesus Christ! Don't make me laugh!

96
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,730
You pathetic, self-deluded little boy!

97
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:29,274
Look at you. Look at you and tell me…

98
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,862
how by any stretch of the imagination
you can call yourself a man!

99
00:08:33,968 --> 00:08:35,219
Fuk you!

100
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,283
Damn it!

101
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,558
Jesus Christ!

102
00:08:55,781 --> 00:09:01,078
- Don't look at me like that, April.
- Could we please go home now?

103
00:11:06,077 --> 00:11:07,829
Fifteenth floor.

104
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:24,240
I'm going to need your help
this morning, old scout.

105
00:11:24,346 --> 00:11:25,700
For the next few hours…

106
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:28,787
you're to warn me
of Bandy's every approach…

107
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:31,206
and you may shield me
from public view…

108
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:34,709
in the likely event I void my stomach.

109
00:11:34,814 --> 00:11:38,505
- It's that bad.
- Good morning, Jack.

110
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,820
Nothing good about it, I assure you.

111
00:12:02,884 --> 00:12:06,574
Of course I knew when you stepped off
the train what you were looking for.

112
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:09,994
A small remodeled barn
or carriage house.

113
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,625
And I just hate to be the one to tell you…

114
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:14,582
that sort of thing isn't available anymore.

115
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:17,335
But I don't want you to despair.

116
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,111
There is one place up here
I want to show you.

117
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:25,093
Now, of course,
it isn't very desirable at this end.

118
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:26,594
As you can see, Crawford Road…

119
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:30,264
is mostly little cinderblocky,
pickup-trucky places.

120
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,976
Plumbers, carpenters,
little local people of that sort.

121
00:12:34,082 --> 00:12:35,603
But eventually…

122
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,314
eventually it leads up
to Revolutionary Road…

123
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:40,650
which is much nicer.

124
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:43,986
Now, the place I want to show you
is a sweet little house…

125
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:45,905
and a sweet little setting.

126
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,785
Simple, clean lines. Good lawns.
Marvelous for children.

127
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:56,165
It's just around this next curve.
Now you'll see it.

128
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:59,377
There. See the little white one?

129
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:01,087
Sweet, isn't it?

130
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:04,632
The perky way it sits there
on its little slope.

131
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:06,823
Charming, isn't it?

132
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:10,868
Yes.

133
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:22,775
You wanted to see me?

134
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,485
Came for you from Toledo this morning.

135
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,321
- This is the third one this month.
- Sorry. I thought I'd…

136
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:30,074
I'm not prepared to have
this conversation again, Frank.

137
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:32,285
- Do you understand?
- I was literally just…

138
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,620
These folks in the provinces
look up to us.

139
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:35,746
We need to be efficient.

140
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:38,457
We can't have this kind
of back and forth and so forth.

141
00:13:38,563 --> 00:13:42,586
It's just not efficient. Am I right?

142
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:44,068
Yes.

143
00:13:45,153 --> 00:13:47,967
- What was that about?
- Toledo.

144
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:50,428
The branch manager
wants a revised brochure…

145
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:53,139
for the conference on the Knox 500.

146
00:13:53,244 --> 00:13:56,934
"It's just not efficient. Am I right?"

147
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,811
Sounds like a goodie.

148
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:02,148
For God's sake. I don't even know
what the Knox 500 does. Do you?

149
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:04,088
Don't insult me.

150
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:23,252
If you look in the inactive file
under SP-1109…

151
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:26,881
you'll find copies of all the stuff
we sent to the agency.

152
00:14:26,986 --> 00:14:33,200
That way we can trace the thing back
to its original sources.

153
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:38,809
I hope you weren't planning
on an early lunch.

154
00:14:38,914 --> 00:14:42,605
No, I'm not really hungry.

155
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,607
Good. I'll check on you later, then.

156
00:14:44,712 --> 00:14:45,941
- All right?
- Okay.

157
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:47,465
Okay.

158
00:14:52,344 --> 00:14:54,054
You know something, Maureen?

159
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:57,016
You're lucky you met me.

160
00:14:58,434 --> 00:15:00,019
How's that?

161
00:15:01,812 --> 00:15:04,168
I think I can show you the ropes,
you know?

162
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:09,006
There's a certain art
to survival in Knox. Really.

163
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:10,883
Let me show you what I mean.

164
00:15:10,988 --> 00:15:13,177
Waiter?

165
00:15:13,282 --> 00:15:16,285
Bring me the telephone, would you?
And two more martinis.

166
00:15:24,752 --> 00:15:29,089
Klondike-5-5566, please.

167
00:15:30,174 --> 00:15:33,489
Hello, Mrs. Jorgensen?
Frank Wheeler here. Yes.

168
00:15:33,594 --> 00:15:34,702
I just wanted to let you know…

169
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:38,994
that I had to send Maureen Grube
down to Visual Aids for me.

170
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:43,582
I'll probably need her
the rest of the afternoon. Yes.

171
00:15:43,687 --> 00:15:46,398
You, too. Take care now.

172
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:53,405
I never even heard of Visual Aids.

173
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:58,077
That's because it doesn't exist.

174
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:23,121
- Hi, Helen. Come on in.
- I can't stay a minute.

175
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:26,083
I just wanted to bring
these Sedum plantings…

176
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:29,169
for that messy patch
down by the foot of the drive.

177
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:31,213
It's like the European Houseleek…

178
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:35,342
only these have the most
marvelous little yellow blossoms.

179
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:38,553
Now, all it needs the first few days
is a tiny dollop of water…

180
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:40,889
and you'll find it absolutely thrives.

181
00:16:40,994 --> 00:16:43,372
Thank you, Helen. That's so kind of you.

182
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:46,625
Would you like some coffee?

183
00:16:58,261 --> 00:17:01,034
Is there something
I can do for you, Helen?

184
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,578
I almost forgot!

185
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:06,957
There is one small favor
I would like to ask.

186
00:17:07,062 --> 00:17:08,605
It's about…

187
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:14,422
it's about my son, John.
He's been in the hospital.

188
00:17:14,528 --> 00:17:16,675
I'm sorry. Is everything alright?

189
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,721
Well, just for the time being,
he's in Pleasant Brook…

190
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:23,578
Psychiatric.

191
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:29,771
- I see.
- It's nothing serious.

192
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:33,316
I mean, he just got a little run-down.

193
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:35,694
Things can just get the better
of us sometimes.

194
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:40,240
- Don't you agree?
- Yes. Of course.

195
00:17:40,345 --> 00:17:42,075
It's a marvelous facility.

196
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,953
And the treatments
seem to be doing wonders for him.

197
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:47,831
Anyway, they said getting him out
for an afternoon…

198
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:50,250
might do him a little bit of good.

199
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:54,462
I think he finds my friends
a bit conventional, quite frankly.

200
00:17:54,568 --> 00:18:00,051
I mean, he's traveled.
He has a Ph.D. in mathematics.

201
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:03,285
I suppose you could say
he's an intellectual.

202
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,726
It would do him a world of good
to meet a young couple like you.

203
00:18:08,832 --> 00:18:10,959
Well, we'd love to meet him.

204
00:18:13,503 --> 00:18:18,341
- Really?
- Yes. We'd love to.

205
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,553
Thank you, dear.

206
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,598
Thank you.

207
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:31,813
Well, I must be off.

208
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:44,929
I remember the first day
you came off the train.

209
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:49,308
You weren't like my other clients.
You were different.

210
00:18:49,414 --> 00:18:53,877
You just seemed special.

211
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:00,258
Of course, you still are.

212
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:07,056
Remember, just a dollop.
I must scoot. Toodle-oo.

213
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:12,478
Bye.

214
00:19:29,495 --> 00:19:32,123
I think you got me a little drunk.

215
00:19:39,338 --> 00:19:43,051
- You know what today is?
- Monday?

216
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:51,245
It's my birthday. I'm
thirty years old today.

217
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,187
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

218
00:20:00,526 --> 00:20:05,509
What was the name of that department
you made up again?

219
00:20:05,615 --> 00:20:07,074
Visu…

220
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,372
Visual Aids.

221
00:20:14,957 --> 00:20:16,667
What a joke.

222
00:20:20,004 --> 00:20:21,942
What a joke.

223
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:23,507
Oh, my.

224
00:20:25,718 --> 00:20:28,491
You want to hear a real joke?

225
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:29,931
Yes.

226
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:35,998
- My old man worked at Knox.
- Yeah.

227
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:38,648
He was a salesman in Yonkers.

228
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:45,799
Once a year, he used to take me
into the city for lunch.

229
00:20:45,905 --> 00:20:49,720
It was supposed to be a special
life advice sort of occasion.

230
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:53,662
- Nice.
- No. Not really.

231
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,208
I used to sit there and think…

232
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:02,922
"I hope to Christ I don't end up like you."

233
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:08,989
Now here I am…

234
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:11,722
a thirty-year-old Knox man.

235
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,351
Can you beat that?

236
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:19,063
I think I kind of lost you.

237
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:25,047
Your father worked for Knox.

238
00:21:25,152 --> 00:21:28,197
I'm sorry. Everything's just kind of…

239
00:21:30,616 --> 00:21:32,785
going out of focus.

240
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,169
Why don't we get some air?
You and me?

241
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,585
Is this you?

242
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:30,779
- Yeah. You been to Paris?
- I've never really been anywhere.

243
00:22:30,884 --> 00:22:33,907
Well, maybe I'll take you with me, then.

244
00:22:34,012 --> 00:22:36,743
I'm going back first chance I get,
I tell you.

245
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:40,185
People are alive there. Not like here.

246
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:49,486
All I know, April, is…

247
00:22:51,113 --> 00:22:53,760
I want to feel things.

248
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:58,287
Really feel them. You know?

249
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:01,498
How's that for an ambition?

250
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,294
Frank Wheeler.

251
00:23:06,878 --> 00:23:11,049
I think you're the most interesting
person I've ever met.

252
00:23:17,389 --> 00:23:20,851
Guess this wasn't in your mind
when you went to work this morning?

253
00:23:22,352 --> 00:23:24,396
No, it certainly wasn't.

254
00:23:43,582 --> 00:23:45,417
Do you have a cigarette, Frank?

255
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:48,879
Yeah, sure.

256
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:58,513
There you go.

257
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:04,205
- Can I get you a drink or anything?
- No, thanks, Maureen.

258
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:05,915
Actually it's…

259
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:10,628
It's getting kind of late.
I guess I'd better be cutting out.

260
00:24:10,734 --> 00:24:14,029
Gee. That's right.

261
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:16,259
Did you miss your train?

262
00:24:16,364 --> 00:24:19,326
That's all right. I'll catch the next one.

263
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:23,997
Listen. You were swell.

264
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:32,505
Take care now.

265
00:25:06,664 --> 00:25:10,146
- Frank.
- Why are you all dressed up?

266
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:14,734
First of all, I missed you
all day and I want to say I'm sorry.

267
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,071
I'm sorry for the way
I've been since the play.

268
00:25:18,176 --> 00:25:22,597
I'm sorry for everything. And I love you.

269
00:25:24,265 --> 00:25:27,852
The rest can wait. Now, you…

270
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,001
just wait here till I call you, okay?

271
00:25:32,106 --> 00:25:33,441
Okay.

272
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:45,536
All right, Frank, you can come in now.

273
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:03,032
"Happy birthday to you."

274
00:26:03,137 --> 00:26:06,369
"Happy birthday to you."

275
00:26:06,474 --> 00:26:11,040
"Happy birthday, dear daddy."

276
00:26:11,145 --> 00:26:15,900
"Happy birthday to you."

277
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:19,298
Happy birthday, darling.

278
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:22,990
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too.

279
00:26:39,173 --> 00:26:40,591
Frank?

280
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:52,456
Frank, I have had
the most wonderful idea.

281
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:54,208
I've been thinking about it all day.

282
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:56,168
Baby, what's all this about?

283
00:26:56,274 --> 00:26:58,295
You know how much money
we have saved?

284
00:26:58,401 --> 00:27:01,549
Enough to live on for six months
without you earning another dime.

285
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:03,847
And with the money we could get
from the house and the car…

286
00:27:03,948 --> 00:27:06,679
- longer than that.
- What we'd get for the house?

287
00:27:06,784 --> 00:27:08,514
Sweetheart, what are you talking about?

288
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:10,121
Where are we going to live?

289
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:13,894
Paris.

290
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,104
What?

291
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:17,319
You always said it was the only place
you'd ever been…

292
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,068
that you wanted to go back to,
the only place that was worth living.

293
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,653
So why don't we go there?

294
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:25,614
- You're serious.
- Yes.

295
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,826
- What's stopping us?
- What's stopping us?

296
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:31,078
Well, I can think of a number
of different things.

297
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:34,832
For example, what kind of job
could I possibly get?

298
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:38,043
You won't be getting any kind of a job.

299
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:41,463
- Because I will.
- Right.

300
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:43,924
Don't laugh at me. Listen a minute.

301
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,802
Do you know what they pay
for secretarial positions…

302
00:27:46,907 --> 00:27:49,012
- in government agencies in Europe?
- No, I don't.

303
00:27:49,118 --> 00:27:50,973
Listen, Frank, I'm serious about this.

304
00:27:51,078 --> 00:27:52,103
Do you think I'm kidding or something?

305
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:54,601
Okay. I just have
a couple of questions, is all.

306
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:57,563
For one thing, what exactly
am I supposed to be doing…

307
00:27:57,668 --> 00:27:59,773
while you're out earning all this money?

308
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:04,027
Don't you see? That's the whole idea.

309
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:07,573
You'll be doing what you
should have done seven years ago.

310
00:28:07,678 --> 00:28:09,450
You'll have time.

311
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:11,873
For the first time in your life
you'll have time to find out…

312
00:28:11,974 --> 00:28:14,079
what it is that you actually want to do.

313
00:28:14,184 --> 00:28:15,414
And when you figure it out…

314
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,481
you'll have the time
and freedom to start doing it.

315
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:26,238
Sweetheart, that's just not
very realistic, is all.

316
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:34,641
No, Frank. This is what's unrealistic.

317
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:37,185
It's unrealistic for a man
with a fine mind…

318
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:41,273
to go on working year after year
at a job he can't stand.

319
00:28:41,378 --> 00:28:43,191
Coming home to a place
he can't stand…

320
00:28:43,297 --> 00:28:48,071
to a wife who's equally unable
to stand the same things.

321
00:28:48,177 --> 00:28:50,387
Do you want to know the worst part?

322
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,162
Our whole existence here is
based on this great premise…

323
00:28:55,267 --> 00:29:01,793
that we're special and superior
to the whole thing. But we're not.

324
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:04,963
We're just like everyone else. Look at us.

325
00:29:05,068 --> 00:29:08,091
We've bought into the same
ridiculous delusion…

326
00:29:08,197 --> 00:29:10,427
this idea that
you have to resign from life…

327
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:14,598
and settle down
the moment you have children.

328
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:17,350
And we've been punishing
each other for it.

329
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:20,437
Listen. We decided to move out here.

330
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:22,564
No one forced me
to take the job at Knox.

331
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:25,317
Whoever said I was meant
to be a big deal, anyway?

332
00:29:25,422 --> 00:29:27,152
When I first met you…

333
00:29:27,257 --> 00:29:29,696
there was nothing in the world
you couldn't do or be.

334
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,698
When you first met me,
I was a little wise guy…

335
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:34,075
- with a big mouth, that's all.
- You were not!

336
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:36,350
How can you even say that?

337
00:29:38,226 --> 00:29:41,833
Okay. So I'll have time.

338
00:29:41,938 --> 00:29:45,629
God knows that's appealing.
It's very appealing.

339
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:47,176
And everything you're saying
makes sense…

340
00:29:47,277 --> 00:29:49,512
if I had a definite talent,
if I were a writer or an artist.

341
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:54,220
No. But Frank, listen. Listen to me.

342
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,765
It's what you are that's being stifled.

343
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:02,042
It's what you are that's being denied
and denied in this kind of life.

344
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,629
And what's that?

345
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,092
Don't you know?

346
00:30:12,302 --> 00:30:16,681
You are the most beautiful
and wonderful thing in the world.

347
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,103
You're a man.

348
00:30:40,747 --> 00:30:47,254
This is our chance, Frank.
This is our one chance.

349
00:30:52,092 --> 00:30:53,718
Okay.

350
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,848
Okay?

351
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:04,854
Why not? Why the hell not?

352
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:30,274
- Good morning, all.
- Morning, Frank.

353
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,696
Franklin, good to see
your shining face. What's the news?

354
00:31:34,801 --> 00:31:38,555
Fellas, I'm moving to Paris.

355
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:42,767
Indeed. And I'm moving to Tangiers.

356
00:32:00,577 --> 00:32:02,682
Intra-company letter to Toledo.

357
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:09,105
Attention B.F. Chalmers,
Branch Manager.

358
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:12,316
With regard to recent
and repeated correspondence…

359
00:32:12,422 --> 00:32:15,069
this is to advise
that the matter has been…

360
00:32:15,174 --> 00:32:19,699
very satisfactorily taken in hand.
Period. Paragraph.

361
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:24,453
We wholly agree that the existing
brochure is unsuitable.

362
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,311
To this end, we have developed, quote…

363
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:36,779
"Speaking of Production Control".

364
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:46,998
Here you go, Mrs. Wheeler.

365
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,062
These are the traveller's cheques
you requested.

366
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,670
- Yes.
- And your steamer reservations.

367
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:56,736
These I'll pass these on
to the embassy for you.

368
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,302
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

369
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:06,183
September. October at the outside.

370
00:33:07,894 --> 00:33:09,628
I just happen to think
people are better off…

371
00:33:09,729 --> 00:33:12,168
doing work they actually like.

372
00:33:12,273 --> 00:33:14,275
Right, yes.

373
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:21,010
But, I mean, assuming there is
this true vocation waiting for you…

374
00:33:21,115 --> 00:33:25,411
wouldn't you be just as likely
to discover it here as there?

375
00:33:26,996 --> 00:33:29,476
I don't think it's possible
to discover anything…

376
00:33:29,582 --> 00:33:32,688
on the 15th floor of the Knox building.

377
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:35,212
I don't think any of you do, either.

378
00:34:34,897 --> 00:34:37,191
Daddy!

379
00:34:38,692 --> 00:34:40,547
- Michael.
- Daddy, will you read us…

380
00:34:40,653 --> 00:34:41,798
Yes.

381
00:34:41,904 --> 00:34:47,387
All the way to here.

382
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:50,891
We have to take a big boat ride
across the sea to get there.

383
00:34:50,996 --> 00:34:56,146
- But I won't know anybody there.
- I know. Neither will I.

384
00:34:56,251 --> 00:34:58,440
But remember how you felt
when you started school?

385
00:34:58,545 --> 00:35:00,984
And now look
how many friends you have.

386
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:04,821
You'll never guess what they eat in Paris.

387
00:35:04,927 --> 00:35:07,574
- You'll never guess.
- What?

388
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,285
- Slimy snails.
- Snails?

389
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:13,936
Slimy snails and icky frogs' legs!

390
00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:29,888
Milly! Where are you, doll?

391
00:35:29,993 --> 00:35:32,538
You better get changed.
They'll be here soon.

392
00:35:33,872 --> 00:35:35,977
Is that what you're wearing?

393
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:42,359
- Don't you like it?
- Yeah. You look great, doll.

394
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,174
Guess I better haul ass.

395
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:01,670
- "Say, kids, what time is it?"
- Hi, gang.

396
00:36:01,775 --> 00:36:04,903
"Howdy Doody Time!"

397
00:36:07,572 --> 00:36:09,491
What are you watching?

398
00:36:48,905 --> 00:36:50,323
Shep!

399
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:54,744
I was calling and calling you.

400
00:36:57,831 --> 00:36:59,249
Hi.

401
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:09,259
Here we go. Just a little something.

402
00:37:11,136 --> 00:37:16,494
- Those look great. I'm starving.
- April, I can't get over it.

403
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:19,706
You look like the cat that ate the canary.

404
00:37:19,811 --> 00:37:24,335
Do you have something to tell us?
Just a little bit of news?

405
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:28,673
Well, actually, Milly, we do have
some important news, yes.

406
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:30,592
I knew it.

407
00:37:30,697 --> 00:37:33,408
Honey, why don't you tell them?
Go ahead.

408
00:37:35,452 --> 00:37:38,057
We're going to Europe.

409
00:37:38,163 --> 00:37:39,664
To Paris.

410
00:37:43,626 --> 00:37:45,128
To live.

411
00:37:48,673 --> 00:37:50,903
- What?
- When?

412
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:55,742
- In September.
- But what for?

413
00:37:55,847 --> 00:38:00,872
What for? Well, because we've
always wanted to…

414
00:38:00,977 --> 00:38:03,583
because the kids are young enough,
because it's beautiful.

415
00:38:03,688 --> 00:38:06,794
I mean, really. Shep,
you've been there, you tell her.

416
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,527
- Yeah, it's a great city.
- Yeah.

417
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,203
When did you make this decision?

418
00:38:20,914 --> 00:38:23,227
About a week ago?
It's hard to remember.

419
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,438
We just suddenly decided to go,
that's all.

420
00:38:25,543 --> 00:38:29,484
- About a week ago, you tell us now.
- We had to get used to the idea.

421
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:32,653
So what's the deal, Frank?
You get a job over there or what?

422
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:37,472
- No. Not exactly.
- What do you mean, not exactly?

423
00:38:39,098 --> 00:38:43,770
Frank won't be getting
any kind of job because I will.

424
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:48,544
So what are you going to do, Frank?

425
00:38:48,649 --> 00:38:52,423
I'm going to study and I'm going to read.

426
00:38:52,528 --> 00:38:56,844
I suppose I'll finally figure out
what I want to do with my life, Shep.

427
00:38:56,949 --> 00:39:03,517
- While she supports you?
- Yes. While she supports me.

428
00:39:03,623 --> 00:39:05,311
In the beginning.

429
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:08,356
You wouldn't believe what they pay
for secretarial work…

430
00:39:08,461 --> 00:39:10,274
in those government agencies
over there.

431
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:13,402
NATO and ECA and those places.

432
00:39:13,508 --> 00:39:15,821
And the cost of living
is dirt cheap, right?

433
00:39:15,927 --> 00:39:17,428
It's so cheap.

434
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,161
The truth is we just need
something different.

435
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:26,290
We're not getting any younger.
We don't want life to pass us by.

436
00:39:26,395 --> 00:39:31,879
- That's right.
- Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids.

437
00:39:31,984 --> 00:39:35,549
I mean it. It really sounds wonderful.

438
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:38,219
- Thank you, Milly.
- Milly.

439
00:39:38,324 --> 00:39:41,680
We'll certainly miss you both,
won't we, sweetie? Golly.

440
00:39:41,786 --> 00:39:43,057
- Sure.
- We'll miss you, too.

441
00:39:43,162 --> 00:39:44,183
- Of course.
- True.

442
00:39:44,288 --> 00:39:46,435
We should have a toast. To Paris!

443
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,103
- To Paris.
- To Paris.

444
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:50,481
To Paris.

445
00:39:50,586 --> 00:39:52,755
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

446
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:07,311
You know what I think?

447
00:40:08,562 --> 00:40:09,667
What?

448
00:40:09,772 --> 00:40:13,796
I think this whole plan
sounds a little immature.

449
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:16,237
God, I am so relieved.

450
00:40:18,322 --> 00:40:21,011
Me, too. I was thinking that
the whole time.

451
00:40:21,117 --> 00:40:22,684
I mean, what kind of man
is going to sit around…

452
00:40:22,785 --> 00:40:24,682
in his bathrobe all day picking his nose…

453
00:40:24,787 --> 00:40:27,022
- while his wife goes out and works?
- I don't know, Shep.

454
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:29,416
I just don't know.

455
00:40:35,422 --> 00:40:37,299
Why are you crying?

456
00:40:39,301 --> 00:40:41,053
What's the matter?

457
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:49,311
It's nothing. I'm just so relieved.

458
00:40:51,105 --> 00:40:55,212
- Shep.
- Don't cry, please.

459
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:58,612
It's all right.
Everything's going to be all right.

460
00:41:01,156 --> 00:41:03,242
My God, their faces!

461
00:41:05,244 --> 00:41:09,643
- God.
- God.

462
00:41:09,748 --> 00:41:12,334
Do you know what this is like, April,
honestly?

463
00:41:13,585 --> 00:41:14,690
Just talking like this?

464
00:41:14,795 --> 00:41:18,485
The whole idea of going off
to Europe this way?

465
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,446
This is the way I felt going up
to the line the first time…

466
00:41:21,552 --> 00:41:22,656
in the war.

467
00:41:22,761 --> 00:41:25,742
I mean, I was probably
just as scared as everyone else…

468
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:29,079
but inside, I never felt better.

469
00:41:29,184 --> 00:41:34,251
I felt alive, I felt full of blood. I felt…

470
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:38,171
Everything seemed more real,
the guys in their uniforms…

471
00:41:38,277 --> 00:41:41,216
the snow on the fields,
the trees, and all of us…

472
00:41:41,321 --> 00:41:44,094
all of us just walking.

473
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:46,972
I mean, I was scared, of course, but…

474
00:41:47,077 --> 00:41:50,183
I just kept thinking, this is it, you know?

475
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:52,958
This is the truth.

476
00:41:56,253 --> 00:42:00,966
- I felt that way once, too.
- When?

477
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:11,476
The first time you made love to me.

478
00:42:15,439 --> 00:42:17,107
April.

479
00:42:55,562 --> 00:42:57,063
Frank.

480
00:43:23,423 --> 00:43:24,736
What's up?

481
00:43:24,841 --> 00:43:28,053
- Bart Pollock's here.
- He's in Bandy's office.

482
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,973
Big deal?

483
00:43:37,062 --> 00:43:39,481
Looks like he wants to talk to you.

484
00:43:44,152 --> 00:43:46,112
Keep my name out of it.

485
00:43:51,576 --> 00:43:55,391
Frank! Good to see you!
You know Bart Pollock?

486
00:43:55,497 --> 00:43:59,604
- Well, we've never met…
- Good to know you, Frank.

487
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:03,088
"Speaking of Production Control"?

488
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:11,096
Frank, this is a crackerjack!

489
00:44:12,263 --> 00:44:16,017
They are tickled to death in Toledo.

490
00:44:23,233 --> 00:44:24,734
Really?

491
00:44:25,818 --> 00:44:28,966
So, this guy Pollock
was perfect presidential material…

492
00:44:29,072 --> 00:44:31,469
in the worst sense.
A million dollar smile…

493
00:44:31,574 --> 00:44:34,472
and about three pounds of muscle
between the ears.

494
00:44:34,577 --> 00:44:36,724
April, you should have heard this guy.

495
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:41,771
"Frank, this is a crackerjack."
What a horse's ass.

496
00:44:41,876 --> 00:44:44,796
Wish I'd seen his face
when you told him you were leaving.

497
00:44:46,422 --> 00:44:47,757
Yeah.

498
00:44:54,389 --> 00:44:55,974
Here they come.

499
00:44:58,935 --> 00:45:01,332
- Sorry to be late.
- You're not late.

500
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:04,168
- The traffic was terrible!
- You didn't have to do that.

501
00:45:04,273 --> 00:45:06,504
- Good to see you.
- Wasn't it terrible, Howard?

502
00:45:06,609 --> 00:45:07,755
Well, Route 12.

503
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,511
By the time they finish
that stretch of road…

504
00:45:09,612 --> 00:45:11,906
they'll have to start
all over again, right?

505
00:45:13,533 --> 00:45:17,807
- And you must be John.
- Say hello, John.

506
00:45:17,912 --> 00:45:21,040
Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.

507
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:25,439
- Where are your darling children?
- They're at a birthday party.

508
00:45:25,545 --> 00:45:27,817
- Sorry they couldn't be here.
- Don't worry.

509
00:45:27,922 --> 00:45:30,277
If I had a certified lunatic
coming around my house…

510
00:45:30,383 --> 00:45:32,697
I'd probably get the kids
out of the way, too.

511
00:45:32,802 --> 00:45:34,824
Look at all this food.

512
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:37,118
You didn't have to go
to any trouble for us.

513
00:45:37,223 --> 00:45:40,852
It's just some sandwiches.
John, would you like a sandwich?

514
00:45:41,936 --> 00:45:45,000
Helen's been talking it up
about you people for months.

515
00:45:45,106 --> 00:45:48,087
The nice young Wheelers
on Revolutionary Road.

516
00:45:48,192 --> 00:45:51,362
The nice young Revolutionaries
on Wheeler Road.

517
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,345
- Would anyone like some sherry?
- Please don't bother, Frank.

518
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:57,888
I'd like some sherry.

519
00:45:57,994 --> 00:46:01,998
And I'll drink Helen's, too,
if she doesn't beat me to it.

520
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:05,813
But, hey, you got a high-ball glass?

521
00:46:05,918 --> 00:46:10,568
Put a couple, three ice cubes in it.
Pour it up to the brim.

522
00:46:10,673 --> 00:46:14,844
- That's the way I like it.
- I think I can handle that.

523
00:46:19,724 --> 00:46:23,455
This egg salad is delicious, April.
You must tell me how you fix it.

524
00:46:23,561 --> 00:46:26,709
- You a lawyer, Frank?
- No, I'm not.

525
00:46:26,814 --> 00:46:28,127
I could use a lawyer.

526
00:46:28,232 --> 00:46:30,879
John, let's not start again
about the lawyer.

527
00:46:30,985 --> 00:46:32,010
Pop, couldn't you just sit there…

528
00:46:32,111 --> 00:46:35,197
and eat your wonderful egg salad
and quit horning in?

529
00:46:36,282 --> 00:46:39,013
See, I've got a good
many questions to ask…

530
00:46:39,118 --> 00:46:41,140
and I'm willing to pay for the answers.

531
00:46:41,245 --> 00:46:44,685
Now, I don't need to be told that
a man who goes after his mother…

532
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,478
with a coffee table is putting himself…

533
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:49,314
in a weak position legally that's obvious.

534
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:52,109
John, come and have a look out
this fabulous picture window.

535
00:46:52,214 --> 00:46:54,737
If he his her with it and kills her,
that's a criminal case.

536
00:46:54,842 --> 00:46:56,238
Look! The sun is coming out.

537
00:46:56,343 --> 00:46:59,825
If all he does is break the coffee table
and give her some aggravation…

538
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:03,120
and she decides to go court over it,
that's a civil case.

539
00:47:03,225 --> 00:47:05,706
Maybe we'll have a rainbow.
John, come have a look.

540
00:47:05,811 --> 00:47:09,126
Ma, how about doing everybody
a favour? How about shutting up!

541
00:47:09,231 --> 00:47:11,920
Settle down, now.

542
00:47:12,026 --> 00:47:14,339
Maybe I can look into it.
Recommend someone.

543
00:47:14,445 --> 00:47:15,696
What do you say?

544
00:47:23,495 --> 00:47:27,811
So, what do you do, Frank?

545
00:47:27,916 --> 00:47:30,939
I work at Knox Business Machines,
actually.

546
00:47:31,045 --> 00:47:32,691
You design the machines?

547
00:47:32,796 --> 00:47:36,028
- Nope.
- Make them, sell them, repair them?

548
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:38,739
- All these questions.
- I help sell them, I guess.

549
00:47:38,844 --> 00:47:43,952
I work in the office. Actually, it's…

550
00:47:44,058 --> 00:47:45,746
Well, it's sort of a stupid job, really.

551
00:47:45,851 --> 00:47:49,750
There's nothing
interesting about it at all.

552
00:47:49,855 --> 00:47:52,294
What do you do it for then?

553
00:47:52,399 --> 00:47:54,212
Maybe Frank doesn't like
being questioned.

554
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:57,299
Okay. I know it's none of my business.

555
00:47:57,404 --> 00:48:00,385
And besides, I know the answer.

556
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:03,013
You want to play house,
you got to have a job.

557
00:48:03,118 --> 00:48:06,683
You want to play very nice house,
very sweet house…

558
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:08,977
then you've got to have
a job you don't like.

559
00:48:09,082 --> 00:48:11,688
Anyone comes along and says,
"What do you do it for?"

560
00:48:11,793 --> 00:48:16,673
He's probably on a four-hour pass
from the state funny farm.

561
00:48:18,091 --> 00:48:21,448
- All agreed? Ma?
- Sorry, Frank.

562
00:48:21,553 --> 00:48:27,120
Don't be. Actually, John, I agree
with everything you just said.

563
00:48:27,226 --> 00:48:29,293
We both do. That's why I'm quitting
the job in the fall.

564
00:48:29,394 --> 00:48:33,815
- We're taking off.
- We're moving to Paris.

565
00:48:36,985 --> 00:48:39,529
Did you know about this, ma?

566
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:46,286
How do you feel about that, ma?
The nice young Wheelers…

567
00:48:49,414 --> 00:48:54,836
The nice young Wheelers are taking off.

568
00:49:00,592 --> 00:49:04,429
- John, please.
- Steady down, son.

569
00:49:08,892 --> 00:49:13,291
John. How about some fresh air?
What do you say?

570
00:49:13,396 --> 00:49:15,126
If that's all right with you?

571
00:49:15,232 --> 00:49:17,003
I don't know, if it's such a good idea…

572
00:49:17,109 --> 00:49:18,963
If John wants to, I don't see the harm.

573
00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:21,905
- Good.
- After you.

574
00:49:25,826 --> 00:49:32,310
- I hear you're a mathematician.
- You hear wrong. It's all gone now.

575
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,645
All gone?

576
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,523
You know what
electrical shock treatments are?

577
00:49:36,628 --> 00:49:40,966
- Yes. Yes, I do.
- I've had 37.

578
00:49:43,885 --> 00:49:46,908
Supposed to jolt out
the emotional problems.

579
00:49:47,013 --> 00:49:51,996
- Just jolted out the mathematics.
- How awful.

580
00:49:52,102 --> 00:49:57,627
"How awful"? Why, because
mathematics is so interesting?

581
00:49:57,732 --> 00:50:01,089
No. Because the shocks
must be awful and…

582
00:50:01,194 --> 00:50:05,260
Because it's awful not to be able
to do what it is that you want to do.

583
00:50:05,365 --> 00:50:07,659
I think mathematics must be dull.

584
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:13,518
- I like your girl, Frank.
- Me too.

585
00:50:13,623 --> 00:50:16,688
So, what do a couple of people
like you have to run away from?

586
00:50:16,793 --> 00:50:19,315
- We're not running.
- So what's in Paris?

587
00:50:19,421 --> 00:50:23,152
- A different way of life.
- Maybe we are running.

588
00:50:23,258 --> 00:50:25,488
We're running
from the hopeless emptiness…

589
00:50:25,593 --> 00:50:29,556
- of the whole life here, right?
- The hopeless emptiness?

590
00:50:33,476 --> 00:50:37,834
Now you've said it. Plenty of people
are on to the emptiness…

591
00:50:37,939 --> 00:50:43,069
but it takes real guts
to see the hopelessness.

592
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:06,863
You know, he's the first person…

593
00:51:06,968 --> 00:51:09,615
who seemed to know
what we were talking about.

594
00:51:09,721 --> 00:51:16,436
Yeah. That's true, isn't it?
Maybe we are just as crazy as he is.

595
00:51:17,729 --> 00:51:21,377
If being crazy means
living life as if it matters…

596
00:51:21,482 --> 00:51:24,569
then I don't care
if we are completely insane.

597
00:51:26,946 --> 00:51:28,448
Do you?

598
00:51:31,242 --> 00:51:32,702
No.

599
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:36,873
I love you so much.

600
00:51:47,759 --> 00:51:51,198
Tell you something, Frank.
That Ted Bandy, nice guy.

601
00:51:51,304 --> 00:51:54,493
Real sport.
Good enough department head and all.

602
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,750
But I'm a little sore at him
for the way he's kept you…

603
00:51:56,851 --> 00:51:58,831
under a bushel all these years.

604
00:51:58,936 --> 00:52:03,127
- This place okay for you?
- It's just fine, sir. Just fine.

605
00:52:03,232 --> 00:52:05,963
One thing interests me, Frank,
and one thing only.

606
00:52:06,068 --> 00:52:10,050
Selling the electronic computer
to the American businessman.

607
00:52:10,156 --> 00:52:14,847
That's why I'm assembling a team.
Men like you.

608
00:52:14,952 --> 00:52:18,225
Not your average salesmen.
It'll mean more money…

609
00:52:18,331 --> 00:52:21,896
and, I got to be honest,
maybe more of a time commitment.

610
00:52:22,001 --> 00:52:25,274
But you'll be a part of
something exciting, Wheeler.

611
00:52:25,379 --> 00:52:27,340
Computers.

612
00:52:30,009 --> 00:52:33,282
Well, sir, it sounds exciting.

613
00:52:33,387 --> 00:52:35,640
- Bart.
- Bart.

614
00:52:40,061 --> 00:52:43,250
Bart, let me ask you a question.

615
00:52:43,356 --> 00:52:47,234
Do you happen to remember
an Earl Wheeler? Out of Yonkers?

616
00:52:48,277 --> 00:52:49,715
Can't say that I do.

617
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,468
- Relation of yours?
- My father.

618
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:56,160
He worked as a salesman for Knox
for almost 20 years.

619
00:52:57,703 --> 00:53:00,601
Earl Wheeler.

620
00:53:00,706 --> 00:53:02,917
Earl Wheeler.

621
00:53:04,752 --> 00:53:06,921
There's no reason you'd remember him.

622
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:11,091
Well, I'm sure he was a good man.

623
00:53:17,681 --> 00:53:19,683
Listen, Bart, there's…

624
00:53:21,352 --> 00:53:23,938
there's something
I should have mentioned earlier.

625
00:53:25,314 --> 00:53:28,150
I'm going to be leaving
the firm in the fall.

626
00:53:30,194 --> 00:53:33,300
- Another outfit?
- No, no, it's not another outfit.

627
00:53:33,405 --> 00:53:36,595
Now, look, Frank.
Is it a question of money?

628
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,305
Because if it is, there's no reason…

629
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:39,435
we can't get together on a satisfactory…

630
00:53:39,536 --> 00:53:43,707
Well, I sure appreciate that,
but no, it's not the money. It's…

631
00:53:45,167 --> 00:53:50,275
Well, it's more of a personal thing.
I hope you understand.

632
00:53:50,381 --> 00:53:55,364
A personal thing? I see.

633
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:58,951
Frank, let me tell you something
my father told me.

634
00:53:59,056 --> 00:54:02,287
A man only gets
a couple of chances in life.

635
00:54:02,393 --> 00:54:04,665
If he doesn't grab them by the balls…

636
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:06,296
it won't be long before
he's sitting around wondering…

637
00:54:06,397 --> 00:54:09,233
how he got to be second rate.

638
00:54:14,655 --> 00:54:16,323
I guess so.

639
00:54:17,366 --> 00:54:25,060
So, do me a favour. Sleep on it.
Discuss it with your wife.

640
00:54:25,165 --> 00:54:26,941
Because let's be honest,
where the hell would any of us be…

641
00:54:27,042 --> 00:54:29,002
without our wives, anyway?

642
00:54:32,297 --> 00:54:36,196
And Frank, in all sincerity,
if you do decide to join us…

643
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:39,388
I believe it'll be a
thing you'll never regret.

644
00:54:40,556 --> 00:54:43,161
And I believe something else, too.

645
00:54:43,267 --> 00:54:47,396
I believe it'd be a fine memorial
to your dad.

646
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:52,901
Think about it, Frank.
Really think about it.

647
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:01,785
Knowing what you've got, comma…

648
00:55:03,245 --> 00:55:06,581
knowing what you need, comma…

649
00:55:07,874 --> 00:55:13,441
knowing what you can do without, dash.

650
00:55:13,547 --> 00:55:16,299
That's inventory control.

651
00:55:33,817 --> 00:55:36,570
"Knowing what you've got, comma…"

652
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:41,241
"knowing what you need, comma…"

653
00:55:42,701 --> 00:55:47,205
"knowing what you can do without,
dash."

654
00:55:48,373 --> 00:55:50,667
"That's inventory control."

655
00:55:52,252 --> 00:55:53,795
Hi, Frank.

656
00:55:55,547 --> 00:55:59,571
- Working late?
- Yeah.

657
00:55:59,676 --> 00:56:02,053
I got to dig myself out here.

658
00:56:03,638 --> 00:56:05,891
I heard you were getting promoted.

659
00:56:07,392 --> 00:56:09,102
Big shot.

660
00:56:12,314 --> 00:56:15,734
I guess your dad
would have been real proud?

661
00:56:23,658 --> 00:56:25,785
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

662
00:56:34,878 --> 00:56:38,131
So maybe I should take you
for a drink or something?

663
00:56:39,674 --> 00:56:43,261
You know, celebrate.

664
00:56:47,182 --> 00:56:48,767
Yeah, maybe.

665
00:56:53,104 --> 00:56:55,231
I'll just get my things.

666
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:04,802
I'm going to bring my doll carriage…

667
00:57:04,908 --> 00:57:07,638
and my three Easter rabbits
and my giraffe…

668
00:57:07,744 --> 00:57:10,975
and all my dolls and my doll house
and my crayons.

669
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,898
I thought maybe
we'd give the doll house to Madeline.

670
00:57:12,999 --> 00:57:14,817
I don't want to give the doll house
to Madeline.

671
00:57:14,918 --> 00:57:16,355
But I already explained to you…

672
00:57:16,461 --> 00:57:17,903
the big things
are going to be hard to pack.

673
00:57:18,004 --> 00:57:19,400
But she can have my bear…

674
00:57:19,505 --> 00:57:22,862
- and my three Easter rabbits.
- No! Just the big things.

675
00:57:22,967 --> 00:57:25,118
Look. Wouldn't you rather go outside
and play with Michael?

676
00:57:25,219 --> 00:57:27,700
- I don't feel like it.
- You've been inside all day.

677
00:57:27,805 --> 00:57:28,951
I don't feel like it.

678
00:57:29,057 --> 00:57:32,163
Well, I don't feel like
explaining everything 15 times…

679
00:57:32,268 --> 00:57:35,521
to somebody who's too bored and silly
to listen!

680
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,091
All right, April. What's the matter?

681
00:57:44,197 --> 00:57:45,218
Nothing.

682
00:57:45,323 --> 00:57:47,845
I don't believe you.
Did something happen this morning?

683
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:51,307
Nothing happened today that I haven't
known about for days and days.

684
00:57:51,412 --> 00:57:53,184
What?

685
00:57:53,289 --> 00:57:55,978
God, Frank, please don't look so dense.

686
00:57:56,084 --> 00:57:57,980
You mean you haven't guessed
or anything?

687
00:57:58,086 --> 00:58:00,505
April, what are you talking about?

688
00:58:03,674 --> 00:58:05,885
I'm pregnant, that's all.

689
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:09,700
What?

690
00:58:09,806 --> 00:58:12,206
Frank, I meant to wait till the kids
were in bed to tell you…

691
00:58:12,308 --> 00:58:14,997
but I just… Well, I've been
pretty sure all week…

692
00:58:15,102 --> 00:58:16,540
and today I went to the doctor…

693
00:58:16,646 --> 00:58:19,440
and now I can't even pretend it's not true.

694
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:23,778
- How long?
- Ten weeks.

695
00:58:25,279 --> 00:58:29,637
Ten weeks. Ten weeks?
And you wait until now to tell me?

696
00:58:29,742 --> 00:58:32,890
No, I thought…
I don't know what I thought.

697
00:58:32,995 --> 00:58:39,522
- I'm sorry, Frank. I'm so sorry.
- I know. I know you are. All right?

698
00:58:39,627 --> 00:58:41,357
There are things we can do.

699
00:58:41,462 --> 00:58:44,693
We don't have to let this stop us
from going, do we?

700
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:47,071
Remember that girl at school
I told you about?

701
00:58:47,176 --> 00:58:50,805
As long as we take care of it
before 12 weeks, it's fine.

702
00:58:52,098 --> 00:58:54,809
We've got to be together in this, Frank.

703
00:58:57,269 --> 00:58:58,604
Well…

704
00:58:59,814 --> 00:59:02,900
we'll figure it out. All right?

705
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:05,778
Come here.

706
00:59:08,489 --> 00:59:12,263
Twelve weeks.
So we have time to decide, right?

707
00:59:12,368 --> 00:59:13,786
Right.

708
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,623
I love you.

709
00:59:21,752 --> 00:59:23,587
I love you, too.

710
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:54,618
I got you.

711
01:00:07,423 --> 01:00:11,552
So, Frank, how's work?
They going to survive without you?

712
01:00:13,762 --> 01:00:16,432
Actually, something kind of funny
happened the other day.

713
01:00:17,808 --> 01:00:19,663
I did some dumb little piece of work…

714
01:00:19,768 --> 01:00:21,498
to get myself off the hook with Bandy…

715
01:00:21,603 --> 01:00:25,335
and suddenly, I'm the bright young man.

716
01:00:25,441 --> 01:00:27,963
- That's always the way, ain't it?
- It's incredible.

717
01:00:28,068 --> 01:00:30,299
I mean, I knocked this thing off
in a couple of minutes…

718
01:00:30,404 --> 01:00:34,511
and now they want me to join
their team of "specialist" salesmen.

719
01:00:34,616 --> 01:00:36,326
Morons.

720
01:00:38,036 --> 01:00:39,937
Well, it would be funny
if they weren't offering…

721
01:00:40,038 --> 01:00:42,291
so much damn money.

722
01:00:46,295 --> 01:00:48,608
So, are you tempted?

723
01:00:48,714 --> 01:00:53,010
Well, it's just kind of ironic,
don't you think?

724
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:17,868
I thought you turned the job down.

725
01:01:19,369 --> 01:01:20,954
Not yet.

726
01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:25,145
It's just an option, that's all.

727
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:26,776
With the kind of money they're talking…

728
01:01:26,877 --> 01:01:28,069
things could be different for us here.

729
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:31,818
We could get a better place. Travel.

730
01:01:31,923 --> 01:01:35,238
The point is, we could be happy here,
at least for a little while.

731
01:01:35,344 --> 01:01:37,616
It is possible that Parisians
aren't the only ones…

732
01:01:37,721 --> 01:01:40,410
capable of leading
interesting lives, April.

733
01:01:40,515 --> 01:01:42,621
So you've made up your mind?

734
01:01:42,726 --> 01:01:47,355
No. Like I said, it's just an option.
That's all.

735
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:53,840
And supposing you're right.
You make all this money…

736
01:01:53,945 --> 01:01:57,260
and we have this interesting life here.

737
01:01:57,365 --> 01:01:59,220
Won't you still be wasting your life…

738
01:01:59,326 --> 01:02:01,870
toiling away at a job you find ridiculous?

739
01:02:02,996 --> 01:02:05,268
Maybe we let that be my business,
all right?

740
01:02:05,373 --> 01:02:06,644
Your business?

741
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:10,462
You know what? It's too hot for this.
I'm going to go get wet.

742
01:02:22,724 --> 01:02:26,289
- You don't want to go, do you?
- Come on, April. Of course, I do.

743
01:02:26,394 --> 01:02:29,292
No, you don't. Because you've never
tried at anything.

744
01:02:29,397 --> 01:02:32,212
And if you don't try at anything,
you can't fail.

745
01:02:32,317 --> 01:02:34,631
What the hell do you mean I don't try?

746
01:02:34,736 --> 01:02:37,300
I support you, don't I?
I pay for this house.

747
01:02:37,405 --> 01:02:39,803
I work ten hours a day
at a job I can't stand.

748
01:02:39,908 --> 01:02:42,430
- You don't have to.
- Bullshit!

749
01:02:42,535 --> 01:02:43,765
Look, I'm not happy about it.

750
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:46,684
But I have the backbone not
to run away from my responsibilities.

751
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:50,293
It takes backbone
to lead the life you want, Frank.

752
01:02:54,422 --> 01:02:55,443
Where are you going?

753
01:02:55,548 --> 01:02:56,782
If it's all right with you, April…

754
01:02:56,883 --> 01:02:59,761
I'm going to go use the bathroom. Okay?

755
01:03:28,206 --> 01:03:31,229
What the hell are you going to do
with this?

756
01:03:31,334 --> 01:03:32,818
And what do you think
you're going to do?

757
01:03:32,919 --> 01:03:34,778
- You're going to stop me?
- You're damn right I am!

758
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:36,317
- Go ahead and try.
- Listen to me.

759
01:03:36,422 --> 01:03:39,362
You do this, April, you do this
and I swear to God I'll…

760
01:03:39,467 --> 01:03:42,115
You'll what? You'll leave me?
Is that a threat or a promise?

761
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:43,287
When did you buy this, April?

762
01:03:43,388 --> 01:03:44,788
How long have you had this?
I want to know!

763
01:03:44,889 --> 01:03:45,910
Jesus Christ.

764
01:03:46,015 --> 01:03:49,038
You really are being melodramatic
about this whole thing.

765
01:03:49,143 --> 01:03:51,415
As long as it's done
in the first 12 weeks…

766
01:03:51,521 --> 01:03:54,001
- it's perfectly safe.
- That's now, April!

767
01:03:54,107 --> 01:03:56,003
- Don't I get a say?
- Of course you do!

768
01:03:56,109 --> 01:03:58,256
It would be for you, Frank.
Don't you see?

769
01:03:58,361 --> 01:04:00,341
So you can have time,
just like we talked about.

770
01:04:00,446 --> 01:04:01,930
How can it be for me
when the thought of it…

771
01:04:02,031 --> 01:04:04,011
makes my stomach turn over,
for God's sake?

772
01:04:04,117 --> 01:04:05,388
Then it's for me.

773
01:04:05,493 --> 01:04:07,348
Tell me we can have the baby
in Paris, Frank.

774
01:04:07,453 --> 01:04:11,435
Tell me we can have a different life.
But don't make me stay here. Please.

775
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:15,064
- We can't have the baby in Paris.
- Why not?

776
01:04:15,169 --> 01:04:18,234
I don't need everything we have here.
I don't care where we live.

777
01:04:18,339 --> 01:04:21,696
I mean, who made these rules, anyway?

778
01:04:21,801 --> 01:04:26,951
Look, the only reason we moved
out here was because I got pregnant.

779
01:04:27,056 --> 01:04:29,583
Then we had another child to prove
the first one wasn't a mistake.

780
01:04:29,684 --> 01:04:33,207
I mean, how long does it go on?

781
01:04:33,312 --> 01:04:37,650
Frank.
Do you actually want another child?

782
01:04:38,776 --> 01:04:43,050
Well, do you? Come on, tell me.

783
01:04:43,156 --> 01:04:46,679
Tell me the truth, Frank.
Remember that?

784
01:04:46,784 --> 01:04:48,597
We used to live by it.

785
01:04:48,703 --> 01:04:51,142
And you know what's so good
about the truth?

786
01:04:51,247 --> 01:04:52,393
Everyone knows what it is…

787
01:04:52,498 --> 01:04:55,146
however long they've lived without it.

788
01:04:55,251 --> 01:05:01,026
No one forgets the truth, Frank.
They just get better at lying.

789
01:05:01,132 --> 01:05:02,758
So tell me…

790
01:05:03,801 --> 01:05:07,700
do you really want another child?

791
01:05:07,805 --> 01:05:10,224
All I know is what I feel.

792
01:05:12,643 --> 01:05:16,876
And anyone else in their right mind
would feel the same way, April.

793
01:05:16,981 --> 01:05:21,338
But I've had two children.
Doesn't that count in my favour?

794
01:05:21,444 --> 01:05:24,341
Christ, April! The fact that
you even put it that way!

795
01:05:24,447 --> 01:05:26,135
You make it seem as if having children…

796
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,554
is some sort of a goddamn punishment.

797
01:05:28,659 --> 01:05:31,078
I love my children, Frank.

798
01:05:32,413 --> 01:05:35,269
And you're sure about that?

799
01:05:35,374 --> 01:05:37,605
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

800
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:41,942
April, you just said our daughter
was a mistake.

801
01:05:42,047 --> 01:05:43,865
How do I know you didn't try
to get rid of her…

802
01:05:43,966 --> 01:05:45,529
- or Michael for that matter?
- No.

803
01:05:45,634 --> 01:05:48,532
How do I know you didn't try to flush
our entire fuking family…

804
01:05:48,637 --> 01:05:50,576
- down the toilet?
- No, that's not true.

805
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:53,746
- Of course I didn't.
- But how do I know, April?

806
01:05:53,851 --> 01:05:57,333
Stop. Please just stop, Frank.

807
01:05:57,438 --> 01:06:01,795
April, a normal woman,
a normal sane mother…

808
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:05,257
doesn't buy a piece of rubber tubing
to give herself an abortion…

809
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:08,908
so she can live out
some kind of a goddamn fantasy.

810
01:06:19,084 --> 01:06:21,440
Look, all I'm saying is…

811
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:25,569
you don't seem entirely rational
about this thing.

812
01:06:25,674 --> 01:06:27,905
And I think it's about time
we found somebody…

813
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:30,471
to help make some sense of your life.

814
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:34,266
And the new job's going to
pay for that, too?

815
01:06:36,935 --> 01:06:42,586
April, if you need a shrink,
it will be paid for.

816
01:06:42,691 --> 01:06:44,318
Obviously.

817
01:06:48,155 --> 01:06:53,285
Okay. I guess there isn't much more
to say then, is there?

818
01:07:02,169 --> 01:07:05,839
So I guess Paris
was a pretty childish idea?

819
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,305
I guess maybe it was.

820
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:34,443
April, we can be happy here.
I can make you happy here.

821
01:07:34,576 --> 01:07:38,330
We've had a great couple of months.
It doesn't need to end.

822
01:07:40,832 --> 01:07:45,671
We're going to be okay. I promise.

823
01:07:49,049 --> 01:07:51,176
I hope so, Frank.

824
01:07:52,886 --> 01:07:55,097
I really hope so.

825
01:08:35,011 --> 01:08:37,806
Thank you for waiting.
Mr. Pollock will see you now.

826
01:08:40,183 --> 01:08:41,643
Thanks so much.

827
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:55,365
Foiled by faulty contraception.

828
01:08:56,616 --> 01:08:58,096
I can't say that I'm sorry.

829
01:08:58,201 --> 01:09:00,849
You'd have been sorely missed
in the old cubicle…

830
01:09:00,954 --> 01:09:02,058
I can tell you that.

831
01:09:02,163 --> 01:09:04,686
Wouldn't have been the same
without you.

832
01:09:04,791 --> 01:09:08,545
Besides… Well…

833
01:09:10,839 --> 01:09:13,069
What?

834
01:09:13,174 --> 01:09:19,139
The plan always seemed
a touch unrealistic, don't you think?

835
01:09:22,976 --> 01:09:24,585
I suppose
it's none of my business, really.

836
01:09:24,686 --> 01:09:28,523
No. I suppose it isn't.

837
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:32,902
Well…

838
01:09:35,613 --> 01:09:39,409
They'll be celebrating
in the secretarial pool.

839
01:10:08,146 --> 01:10:11,294
Hey! Remember the first time
you brought us here?

840
01:10:11,399 --> 01:10:12,587
Absolutely.

841
01:10:12,692 --> 01:10:16,549
You said it takes a special kind
of taste to enjoy Vito's Log Cabin.

842
01:10:16,654 --> 01:10:19,866
It's so awful, it's kind of nice.

843
01:10:23,077 --> 01:10:26,976
Look at me. I'm just so happy.

844
01:10:27,081 --> 01:10:30,126
Our little gang's back together again.

845
01:10:42,346 --> 01:10:46,601
- Hey, Europe's not going anywhere.
- That's right.

846
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:12,376
April, honey, how about a dance?

847
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:16,358
Not right now. Maybe later.

848
01:11:16,464 --> 01:11:19,800
- I'll dance.
- Okay.

849
01:11:33,981 --> 01:11:37,630
Guess she's still pretty blue about Paris?

850
01:11:37,735 --> 01:11:39,924
- Think she'll be okay?
- Sure.

851
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,927
Give us girls a couple of days
and we can get over anything.

852
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:44,367
Right.

853
01:11:45,993 --> 01:11:47,536
Frank.

854
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:51,415
Frank.

855
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:55,022
Frank.

856
01:11:55,127 --> 01:12:00,486
- Frank.
- Are you okay? Milly?

857
01:12:00,591 --> 01:12:02,093
I'm so sorry.

858
01:12:03,302 --> 01:12:04,678
Excuse me.

859
01:12:09,183 --> 01:12:11,455
That's just great.

860
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,833
How the hell
are we supposed to get out now?

861
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:16,440
Boy.

862
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,798
Don't worry about it, Shep.
We can wait. Really.

863
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:22,549
What about the sitter?

864
01:12:22,655 --> 01:12:24,593
Listen, why don't you drive Milly home…

865
01:12:24,698 --> 01:12:26,808
then go home yourself.
That takes care of both sitters.

866
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:30,599
- Then Shep can take me home later.
- Yeah, it's fine by me.

867
01:12:30,704 --> 01:12:32,684
Okay, then.

868
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:36,980
- You'll be all right?
- Sure.

869
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:38,504
Okay.

870
01:12:39,672 --> 01:12:42,152
- Good night.
- Good night.

871
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:43,676
Feel better.

872
01:13:03,737 --> 01:13:06,198
I'm sorry you're not
going away any more.

873
01:13:07,574 --> 01:13:09,535
I know it was important to you.

874
01:13:11,161 --> 01:13:16,228
Don't take this wrong,
but I've been there.

875
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:18,502
They don't have so much
we don't have here.

876
01:13:20,045 --> 01:13:22,005
It didn't have to be Paris.

877
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:27,531
You just wanted out?

878
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:29,638
I wanted in.

879
01:13:32,516 --> 01:13:36,812
I just wanted us to live again.

880
01:13:41,942 --> 01:13:44,820
For years,
I thought we shared this secret.

881
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,951
That we would be wonderful in the world.

882
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:57,082
I didn't exactly know how, but just…

883
01:13:58,625 --> 01:14:01,211
Just the possibility kept me hoping.

884
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:10,721
How pathetic is that?

885
01:14:12,306 --> 01:14:13,974
So stupid.

886
01:14:15,892 --> 01:14:21,857
To put all your hopes in a promise
that was never made?

887
01:14:25,152 --> 01:14:28,300
See, Frank knows.
He knows what he wants.

888
01:14:28,405 --> 01:14:31,158
He's found his place. He's just fine.

889
01:14:32,325 --> 01:14:34,578
Married, two kids.

890
01:14:39,332 --> 01:14:41,209
It should be enough.

891
01:14:46,465 --> 01:14:48,175
It is for him.

892
01:14:52,637 --> 01:14:54,139
And he's right.

893
01:14:56,725 --> 01:15:00,707
We were never special or destined
or anything at all.

894
01:15:00,812 --> 01:15:02,689
Yes, you are.

895
01:15:04,065 --> 01:15:05,400
You're…

896
01:15:07,152 --> 01:15:08,798
You're the Wheelers.

897
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:13,386
You're a terrific couple.
Everybody says so.

898
01:15:13,491 --> 01:15:15,827
I saw a whole other future.

899
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:21,166
I can't stop seeing it.

900
01:15:26,296 --> 01:15:27,797
Can't leave…

901
01:15:29,924 --> 01:15:31,426
can't stay.

902
01:15:33,553 --> 01:15:35,764
No damn use to anyone.

903
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:45,065
Come on.

904
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:48,359
Let's do it.

905
01:16:57,762 --> 01:17:02,975
- Let me take you somewhere.
- No. Just do it here. Now.

906
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:50,690
April.

907
01:17:53,234 --> 01:17:55,278
This is what I've always wanted.

908
01:17:57,113 --> 01:18:00,908
- I love you.
- Don't say that.

909
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:05,975
No. I mean it, I love you.

910
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:10,960
Please, just be quiet for a minute.

911
01:18:14,422 --> 01:18:16,924
Then you can take me home.

912
01:19:07,683 --> 01:19:09,268
It's beautiful out.

913
01:19:10,603 --> 01:19:11,979
Yes, it is.

914
01:19:16,734 --> 01:19:19,381
You know what today is?

915
01:19:19,486 --> 01:19:22,448
- It's 12 weeks.
- That's right.

916
01:19:25,784 --> 01:19:29,391
Look, this has been
kind of a crazy summer.

917
01:19:29,496 --> 01:19:31,268
We've both been under a strain.

918
01:19:31,373 --> 01:19:34,855
I mean, I understand why you're upset.

919
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,630
You know I'm not sleeping with you,
and you want to know why.

920
01:19:40,174 --> 01:19:41,194
Well, I'm sorry, Frank…

921
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:45,532
but I really don't feel
like talking about it.

922
01:19:45,637 --> 01:19:48,744
All right. Then what should we
talk about, April?

923
01:19:48,849 --> 01:19:52,122
Would it be all right
if we didn't talk about anything?

924
01:19:52,227 --> 01:19:53,961
I mean, can't we just take each day
as it comes…

925
01:19:54,062 --> 01:19:55,917
and do the best we can…

926
01:19:56,023 --> 01:19:59,629
and not feel like we have to
talk about everything all the time?

927
01:19:59,735 --> 01:20:01,423
I don't think I'm suggesting…

928
01:20:01,528 --> 01:20:04,760
that we talk about everything
all the time. Look.

929
01:20:04,865 --> 01:20:07,304
My point is we've both been
under a strain…

930
01:20:07,409 --> 01:20:11,641
and we ought to be helping each other
out as much as we can right now.

931
01:20:11,747 --> 01:20:16,501
I mean, God knows my own behaviour
has been pretty weird lately.

932
01:20:18,462 --> 01:20:19,737
As a matter of fact, there is something…

933
01:20:19,838 --> 01:20:21,632
I'd like to tell you about.

934
01:20:24,343 --> 01:20:29,618
I've been with a girl a few times,
in the city.

935
01:20:29,723 --> 01:20:32,329
A girl I hardly even know.

936
01:20:32,434 --> 01:20:39,753
It was nothing to me,
but it's over now, really over.

937
01:20:39,858 --> 01:20:40,967
And if I weren't sure of that…

938
01:20:41,068 --> 01:20:43,862
I guess I could never have told you
about it.

939
01:20:49,117 --> 01:20:53,391
- Why did you?
- Baby, I don't know.

940
01:20:53,497 --> 01:20:56,186
I think it's a simple case
of wanting to be a man again…

941
01:20:56,291 --> 01:20:58,104
after all that abortion business.

942
01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:01,775
Some kind of neurotic,
irrational need to prove something.

943
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:05,236
No. I don't mean
why did you have the girl.

944
01:21:05,342 --> 01:21:09,262
I mean, why did you tell me about it?

945
01:21:10,555 --> 01:21:14,684
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what's the point?

946
01:21:15,811 --> 01:21:19,084
Is it supposed to make me jealous
or something?

947
01:21:19,189 --> 01:21:21,127
Is it supposed to make me
fall in love with you…

948
01:21:21,233 --> 01:21:23,838
or back into bed with you, or what?

949
01:21:23,944 --> 01:21:29,094
I mean, what would you like me
to say, Frank?

950
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,910
Why don't you say what you feel, April?

951
01:21:33,036 --> 01:21:35,517
I don't feel anything.

952
01:21:35,622 --> 01:21:37,435
In other words,
you don't care what I do…

953
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:40,252
or who I fuk or anything?

954
01:21:43,255 --> 01:21:47,300
No, I guess that's right. I don't.

955
01:21:49,177 --> 01:21:51,950
- Fuk who you like.
- April.

956
01:21:52,055 --> 01:21:54,327
Don't you understand
that I want you to care?

957
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:57,664
I know. I know you do.

958
01:21:57,769 --> 01:22:00,041
And I suppose I would if I loved you.

959
01:22:00,146 --> 01:22:03,336
But I don't think I do any more.
And I only just figured that out.

960
01:22:03,441 --> 01:22:06,881
And that's why I'd just as soon
not do any talking right now.

961
01:22:06,986 --> 01:22:09,384
Don't give me that shit, April.
Don't give me that.

962
01:22:09,489 --> 01:22:12,136
- You know goddamn well you love me.
- You think so?

963
01:22:12,242 --> 01:22:14,327
You know goddamn well!

964
01:22:16,121 --> 01:22:17,956
Anyone home?

965
01:22:22,085 --> 01:22:25,024
I'm sorry dinner's late.
Would anyone like another drink?

966
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:28,987
Don't worry. It's nice to just sit
a bit and socialise.

967
01:22:29,092 --> 01:22:30,784
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble.

968
01:22:30,885 --> 01:22:32,573
With all your packing and whatnot.

969
01:22:32,679 --> 01:22:37,745
I imagine you have a lot
on your plate. No pun intended.

970
01:22:37,851 --> 01:22:40,957
Actually, there's been a change of plans.

971
01:22:41,062 --> 01:22:44,877
I thought maybe it was obvious.
April here is pregnant.

972
01:22:44,983 --> 01:22:48,256
- Congratulations.
- April!

973
01:22:48,361 --> 01:22:51,426
I can't tell you how pleased I am!

974
01:22:51,531 --> 01:22:53,931
But I expect you'll be needing
a bigger house now, won't you?

975
01:22:54,033 --> 01:22:57,098
Hold it a second, ma.
Hold on a second, ma.

976
01:22:57,203 --> 01:23:01,018
I don't get this.
I mean, what's so obvious about it?

977
01:23:01,124 --> 01:23:04,188
I mean, okay, she's pregnant, so what?

978
01:23:04,294 --> 01:23:06,274
Don't people have babies in Europe?

979
01:23:06,379 --> 01:23:07,775
- John…
- Suppose we just say…

980
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,862
that people anywhere aren't
very well advised to have babies…

981
01:23:10,967 --> 01:23:13,447
unless they can afford them.

982
01:23:13,553 --> 01:23:18,119
Okay, it's a question of money.
Money's a good reason.

983
01:23:18,224 --> 01:23:22,707
But it's hardly ever the real reason.

984
01:23:22,812 --> 01:23:26,085
What's the real reason?

985
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:28,254
Wife talk you out of it or what?

986
01:23:28,359 --> 01:23:33,384
Little woman decide she isn't
quite ready to quit playing house?

987
01:23:33,489 --> 01:23:36,012
No, that's not it. I can tell.

988
01:23:36,117 --> 01:23:39,829
She looks too tough
and adequate as hell.

989
01:23:41,038 --> 01:23:44,417
Okay, then. It must've been you.

990
01:23:45,501 --> 01:23:46,897
- What happened?
- John, please.

991
01:23:47,003 --> 01:23:51,257
- You're being very rude.
- No. What happened, Frank?

992
01:23:55,678 --> 01:23:57,241
You get cold feet?

993
01:23:57,346 --> 01:24:00,995
You decide
you're better off here after all?

994
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:06,125
You figure it's more comfy here…

995
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:10,234
in the old hopeless emptiness after all?

996
01:24:13,237 --> 01:24:15,050
That did it. Look at his face.

997
01:24:15,156 --> 01:24:17,219
What's the matter, Wheeler?
Am I getting warm?

998
01:24:17,325 --> 01:24:19,221
All right, son. I think we'd better be…

999
01:24:19,327 --> 01:24:20,848
You know something?

1000
01:24:20,953 --> 01:24:23,934
I wouldn't be surprised
if he knocked her up on purpose…

1001
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,649
just so he could spend
the rest of his life…

1002
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,646
hiding behind a maternity dress.

1003
01:24:27,752 --> 01:24:30,983
That way he'd never have to find out
what he's really made of.

1004
01:24:31,088 --> 01:24:35,112
Now look, I think that's just about
enough out of you.

1005
01:24:35,217 --> 01:24:37,573
I mean, who the hell
do you think you are?

1006
01:24:37,678 --> 01:24:39,116
You come in here and say…

1007
01:24:39,221 --> 01:24:42,161
whatever crazy goddamn thing
comes into your head…

1008
01:24:42,266 --> 01:24:44,288
and I think it's about time
somebody told you…

1009
01:24:44,393 --> 01:24:45,748
to keep your god damn mouth shut.

1010
01:24:45,853 --> 01:24:48,834
- He's not well, Frank.
- Not well, my ass!

1011
01:24:48,939 --> 01:24:52,713
I don't give a damn if he's sick
or well or dead or alive…

1012
01:24:52,818 --> 01:24:54,548
he should keep his fuking opinions…

1013
01:24:54,653 --> 01:24:59,074
in the fuking insane asylum
where they belong!

1014
01:25:00,951 --> 01:25:03,996
- Let's go, son.
- Come on, John.

1015
01:25:07,875 --> 01:25:13,797
Big man you got there, April.
Big family man.

1016
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,511
I feel sorry for you.

1017
01:25:21,472 --> 01:25:27,623
Still, maybe you deserve each other.
I mean, the way you look right now…

1018
01:25:27,728 --> 01:25:30,397
I'm beginning to feel sorry for him, too.

1019
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,754
You must give him a pretty bad time…

1020
01:25:33,859 --> 01:25:35,797
if making babies is the only way…

1021
01:25:35,903 --> 01:25:37,925
he can prove he's got a pair of balls.

1022
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:43,160
- You fuking…
- No! He's not well, Frank!

1023
01:25:54,296 --> 01:25:58,258
All right, John.
Let's get on out to the car now.

1024
01:26:03,514 --> 01:26:07,162
April, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1025
01:26:07,267 --> 01:26:11,500
Right. Sorry.

1026
01:26:11,605 --> 01:26:14,419
Ma, have I said
"I'm sorry" enough times?

1027
01:26:14,525 --> 01:26:16,797
Damn! I am sorry, too.

1028
01:26:16,902 --> 01:26:19,883
I bet I'm just about
the sorriest bastard I know.

1029
01:26:19,988 --> 01:26:21,385
But get right down to it…

1030
01:26:21,490 --> 01:26:24,012
I don't have a whole hell
of a lot to be glad about.

1031
01:26:24,117 --> 01:26:25,577
Do I?

1032
01:26:27,955 --> 01:26:33,647
But hey, you know what?
I am glad about one thing.

1033
01:26:33,752 --> 01:26:35,963
You want to know what I'm glad about?

1034
01:26:38,799 --> 01:26:41,760
I'm glad I'm not going to be that kid.

1035
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:01,989
Okay, don't tell me.

1036
01:27:03,031 --> 01:27:05,554
Don't tell me, let me guess.

1037
01:27:05,659 --> 01:27:09,621
I made a disgusting spectacle
of myself, right?

1038
01:27:10,831 --> 01:27:11,851
Right.

1039
01:27:11,957 --> 01:27:13,687
And everything that man said
is true, right?

1040
01:27:13,792 --> 01:27:17,607
- Is that what you're going to say?
- Apparently I don't have to.

1041
01:27:17,713 --> 01:27:20,819
- You're saying it for me.
- Well, you're wrong, April.

1042
01:27:20,924 --> 01:27:24,698
- Really? Why am I wrong?
- Because the man is insane.

1043
01:27:24,803 --> 01:27:28,076
He's fuking insane! Do you know what
the definition of insanity is?

1044
01:27:28,181 --> 01:27:29,369
No. Do you?

1045
01:27:29,474 --> 01:27:33,039
Yes, it's the inability
to relate to another human being.

1046
01:27:33,145 --> 01:27:35,605
It's the inability to love.

1047
01:27:40,068 --> 01:27:43,216
April.

1048
01:27:43,321 --> 01:27:46,261
April!

1049
01:27:46,366 --> 01:27:48,471
The inability…

1050
01:27:48,577 --> 01:27:50,954
The inability to love.

1051
01:27:52,038 --> 01:27:55,353
Frank. You really are a wonderful talker.

1052
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:58,773
If black could be made into white
by talking…

1053
01:27:58,878 --> 01:28:00,817
you'd be the man for the job.

1054
01:28:00,922 --> 01:28:03,445
So now I'm crazy
because I don't love you. Right?

1055
01:28:03,550 --> 01:28:05,488
- Is that the point?
- No. Wrong.

1056
01:28:05,594 --> 01:28:09,868
You're not crazy and you do love me.
That's the point, April.

1057
01:28:09,973 --> 01:28:13,746
But I don't. I hate you.

1058
01:28:13,852 --> 01:28:16,749
You were just some boy
who made me laugh at a party once…

1059
01:28:16,855 --> 01:28:19,711
and now I loathe the sight of you.

1060
01:28:19,816 --> 01:28:23,381
In fact, if you come any closer,
if you touch me or anything…

1061
01:28:23,486 --> 01:28:25,155
I think I'll scream.

1062
01:28:26,698 --> 01:28:28,742
Come on. Stop this, April.

1063
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,019
Fuk you, April!

1064
01:28:36,124 --> 01:28:39,939
Fuk you and all your hateful,
snotty little…

1065
01:28:40,044 --> 01:28:42,317
What're you going to do now?
Are you going to hit me?

1066
01:28:42,422 --> 01:28:45,737
- To show me how much you love me?
- Don't worry, I can't be bothered!

1067
01:28:45,842 --> 01:28:48,406
You're not worth
the trouble it would take to hit you.

1068
01:28:48,511 --> 01:28:51,200
You're not worth the powder
it would take to blow you up.

1069
01:28:51,306 --> 01:28:56,622
You're an empty hollow shell
of a woman!

1070
01:28:56,728 --> 01:29:01,044
What the hell are you doing in
my house if you hate me so much?

1071
01:29:01,149 --> 01:29:03,463
Why the hell are you married to me?

1072
01:29:03,568 --> 01:29:06,299
What the hell are you doing
carrying my child?

1073
01:29:06,404 --> 01:29:07,930
I mean, why didn't you just get rid of it…

1074
01:29:08,031 --> 01:29:09,218
when you had the chance?

1075
01:29:09,324 --> 01:29:12,388
Because listen to me.
Listen to me, I got news for you.

1076
01:29:12,493 --> 01:29:15,413
I wish to God that you had.

1077
01:29:48,654 --> 01:29:50,156
April!

1078
01:29:52,742 --> 01:29:54,452
April!

1079
01:29:58,456 --> 01:30:00,166
April!

1080
01:30:04,962 --> 01:30:06,464
April!

1081
01:30:11,636 --> 01:30:13,095
April!

1082
01:30:14,472 --> 01:30:16,098
April!

1083
01:30:23,814 --> 01:30:25,836
- April!
- Stay away from me.

1084
01:30:25,942 --> 01:30:27,880
- April, listen.
- Stay away from me.

1085
01:30:27,985 --> 01:30:29,928
Can't I even get away from you
in the fuking woods?

1086
01:30:30,029 --> 01:30:32,051
April, listen, I didn't mean that.

1087
01:30:32,156 --> 01:30:33,181
Honestly, I didn't mean what I said.

1088
01:30:33,282 --> 01:30:37,973
Are you still talking? Isn't there
any way to stop your talking?

1089
01:30:38,079 --> 01:30:42,375
I need to think. Can't you see that?
I need to think.

1090
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:45,944
Please come back to the house.
What're you doing out here, April?

1091
01:30:46,045 --> 01:30:50,508
Do you want me to scream again,
Frank? Because I will! I mean it!

1092
01:30:58,474 --> 01:31:01,936
Okay.

1093
01:34:34,272 --> 01:34:35,857
Good morning.

1094
01:34:37,776 --> 01:34:39,569
Good morning.

1095
01:34:41,071 --> 01:34:43,657
Would you like scrambled eggs or fried?

1096
01:34:48,745 --> 01:34:53,937
I don't know. It doesn't really matter.

1097
01:34:54,042 --> 01:34:56,731
Scrambled, I guess, if it's easy.

1098
01:34:56,836 --> 01:35:00,507
Fine. I'll have scrambled, too.

1099
01:35:57,689 --> 01:36:00,942
It's kind of nice having breakfast
without the kids for a change?

1100
01:36:02,026 --> 01:36:04,131
Yes.

1101
01:36:04,237 --> 01:36:07,009
I thought you'd probably want
a good breakfast today.

1102
01:36:07,115 --> 01:36:09,909
I mean, it's kind of an important day
for you, isn't it?

1103
01:36:11,327 --> 01:36:14,330
Isn't this the day you have
your conference with Pollock?

1104
01:36:17,208 --> 01:36:19,252
Yes, that's right.

1105
01:36:21,379 --> 01:36:25,903
- Big deal.
- I imagine it is a pretty big deal.

1106
01:36:26,008 --> 01:36:27,802
For them, anyway.

1107
01:36:29,053 --> 01:36:33,035
What exactly do you think
you'll be doing in your new job?

1108
01:36:33,141 --> 01:36:36,455
You haven't really told me much about it.

1109
01:36:36,561 --> 01:36:38,146
Haven't I?

1110
01:36:40,189 --> 01:36:42,424
Well, I think this whole thing
is about Knox getting ready…

1111
01:36:42,525 --> 01:36:45,840
to buy up one of those
really big computers…

1112
01:36:45,945 --> 01:36:49,093
even bigger than the 500.

1113
01:36:49,198 --> 01:36:52,930
- Didn't I tell you about that?
- No.

1114
01:36:53,035 --> 01:36:55,329
Why don't you tell me now?

1115
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,626
Well…

1116
01:37:01,836 --> 01:37:06,716
you know, basically it's just a big,
fast adding machine.

1117
01:37:08,134 --> 01:37:12,449
Only, instead of mechanical parts,
you see…

1118
01:37:12,555 --> 01:37:18,686
you've got thousands
of individual vacuum tubes.

1119
01:37:28,779 --> 01:37:30,448
I see.

1120
01:37:37,705 --> 01:37:39,915
At least I think I see.

1121
01:37:43,627 --> 01:37:46,672
Yes, it's really kind
of interesting, isn't it?

1122
01:37:49,592 --> 01:37:51,218
Well, I don't know.

1123
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:56,390
Yeah, I guess it is kind
of interesting, in a way.

1124
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:03,522
You should value what you do, Frank.

1125
01:38:04,982 --> 01:38:07,234
You're obviously good at it.

1126
01:38:22,499 --> 01:38:25,169
Well, I guess
I'd better be getting started?

1127
01:38:32,551 --> 01:38:34,470
Listen, though, April, the…

1128
01:38:37,056 --> 01:38:39,141
This was really nice.

1129
01:38:40,351 --> 01:38:43,228
I mean, it was a swell breakfast.
Really, I…

1130
01:38:44,396 --> 01:38:48,358
I don't know when I've ever had
a nicer breakfast.

1131
01:38:50,152 --> 01:38:54,948
Thank you. I enjoyed it, too.

1132
01:39:15,719 --> 01:39:17,346
Then you don't…

1133
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:20,891
You don't hate me or anything?

1134
01:39:22,601 --> 01:39:27,648
No, of course I don't.

1135
01:39:37,032 --> 01:39:39,159
Have a good day.

1136
01:39:45,082 --> 01:39:47,000
Okay, then.

1137
01:39:48,251 --> 01:39:49,795
So long.

1138
01:41:31,229 --> 01:41:33,648
Hello. Milly?

1139
01:41:34,691 --> 01:41:36,401
Everything all right?

1140
01:41:37,986 --> 01:41:41,259
Well, no, I'm afraid
I'm not feeling any better.

1141
01:41:41,364 --> 01:41:43,032
That's really why I called.

1142
01:41:44,242 --> 01:41:48,079
If it's not an inconvenience for you,
this evening would be great.

1143
01:41:49,205 --> 01:41:50,707
What?

1144
01:41:53,084 --> 01:41:58,715
No. Not if they're outdoors playing.

1145
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:04,365
Don't call them in.

1146
01:42:04,470 --> 01:42:09,350
Just give them each a kiss for me…

1147
01:42:10,727 --> 01:42:12,437
and tell them I…

1148
01:42:14,188 --> 01:42:15,690
Tell them…

1149
01:42:16,983 --> 01:42:23,573
You know. All right.
Thank you, Milly. Bye.

1150
01:45:54,658 --> 01:45:57,494
I think I need help.

1151
01:45:58,829 --> 01:46:03,166
115 Revolutionary Road.

1152
01:46:29,901 --> 01:46:32,549
- Frank. They tell you what happened?
- Jesus Christ.

1153
01:46:32,654 --> 01:46:34,968
Shep, I didn't understand
half the things he told me.

1154
01:46:35,073 --> 01:46:38,013
He said the foetus was out
before they got her here.

1155
01:46:38,118 --> 01:46:39,764
And they had to operate to take out…

1156
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:42,892
the, what do you call it, the placenta?

1157
01:46:42,998 --> 01:46:45,270
And now she's still bleeding.

1158
01:46:45,375 --> 01:46:46,817
He said that she'd lost a lot of blood…

1159
01:46:46,918 --> 01:46:50,984
before the ambulance came
and now they're trying to stop it.

1160
01:46:51,089 --> 01:46:52,114
He said a whole lot of things…

1161
01:46:52,215 --> 01:46:54,718
I didn't understand about capillaries…

1162
01:46:55,886 --> 01:46:58,138
He said that she's unconscious.

1163
01:46:59,890 --> 01:47:01,494
- Jesus.
- Okay, Frank.

1164
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:02,625
Why don't you just take a seat?

1165
01:47:02,726 --> 01:47:04,668
What the hell do I want to
sit down for, for God's sake?

1166
01:47:04,769 --> 01:47:09,232
Okay, Frank. Just take it easy.
Take it easy.

1167
01:47:11,234 --> 01:47:14,988
- Frank, have a cigarette.
- She did it to herself, Shep.

1168
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:18,491
She did it to herself.

1169
01:47:26,333 --> 01:47:28,335
I'm going to get you some coffee.

1170
01:48:38,905 --> 01:48:44,013
They were such wonderful people.
Weren't they, Shep?

1171
01:48:44,118 --> 01:48:45,703
It's just devastating.

1172
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:48,601
Poor April.

1173
01:48:48,706 --> 01:48:49,832
Thank you.

1174
01:48:50,958 --> 01:48:55,483
Frank lives in the city now.
Where is it that he works?

1175
01:48:55,588 --> 01:48:58,424
- Bart Pollock Associates.
- Computers?

1176
01:48:59,509 --> 01:49:01,447
Interesting firm.

1177
01:49:01,552 --> 01:49:04,867
- Have you seen him since?
- No. Not back here.

1178
01:49:04,972 --> 01:49:09,163
There are too many memories, I think.
Shep has seen him in the city.

1179
01:49:09,268 --> 01:49:10,770
Haven't you, sweetie?

1180
01:49:11,896 --> 01:49:15,419
Frank is just devoted to those kids.

1181
01:49:15,525 --> 01:49:18,152
Every spare moment he has,
he spends with them.

1182
01:49:34,043 --> 01:49:35,545
Excuse me.

1183
01:49:46,514 --> 01:49:47,974
You all right?

1184
01:49:53,312 --> 01:49:56,107
I don't want to talk
about the Wheelers any more.

1185
01:49:58,317 --> 01:49:59,777
Okay.

1186
01:50:01,654 --> 01:50:03,572
We don't have to.

1187
01:50:05,324 --> 01:50:06,992
We don't have to.

1188
01:50:48,784 --> 01:50:52,246
Daddy, watch. Watch, daddy.

1189
01:50:58,002 --> 01:50:59,731
I can't tell you how pleased I am…

1190
01:50:59,837 --> 01:51:03,277
about the little Revolutionary Road
place, Howard.

1191
01:51:03,382 --> 01:51:06,363
And now whenever I drive past,
it gives me such a lift…

1192
01:51:06,468 --> 01:51:10,409
to see it all perked up
and spanking clean again.

1193
01:51:10,514 --> 01:51:12,808
All the lights in all the windows.

1194
01:51:14,226 --> 01:51:15,873
And do you know? I was just thinking…

1195
01:51:15,978 --> 01:51:18,292
I've loved that little house for years.

1196
01:51:18,397 --> 01:51:21,295
And the Braces are the only
really suitable people…

1197
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,171
I've ever found for it.

1198
01:51:23,277 --> 01:51:26,174
Really nice, congenial people, I mean.

1199
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:29,658
Well, except for the Wheelers,
you mean.

1200
01:51:31,118 --> 01:51:34,266
I was very fond of the Wheelers.

1201
01:51:34,371 --> 01:51:36,601
They were a bit whimsical for my taste.

1202
01:51:36,707 --> 01:51:38,854
A bit neurotic.

1203
01:51:38,959 --> 01:51:40,443
I never stressed it, but they were often…

1204
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:44,776
very trying people
to deal with, in many ways.

1205
01:51:44,882 --> 01:51:47,112
And actually, the main reason…

1206
01:51:47,217 --> 01:51:49,740
that the little house was so hard to sell…

1207
01:51:49,845 --> 01:51:52,909
was because they let it depreciate
so dreadfully.

1208
01:51:53,015 --> 01:51:58,790
Warped window frames, wet cellar,
crayon marks all over the walls…

1209
01:51:58,896 --> 01:52:02,566
filthy smudges around the door knobs
and the fixtures…

1210
01:52:23,375 --> 01:52:30,375
