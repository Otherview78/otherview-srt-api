1
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:04,619
On December 31st., two thousand fourteen,

2
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,809
a taxi cab traveled through San Francisco,

3
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,941
from Chinatown to Marin.

4
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:17,247
The car carried a single passenger,

5
00:01:17,337 --> 00:01:22,477
a woman, her birth name, Adaline Bowman,

6
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,726
current alias, Jennifer Larson.

7
00:01:29,268 --> 00:01:34,283
This is the first and last chapter of her story.

8
00:01:46,835 --> 00:01:50,978
Sorry, ya just gotta be quiet, my dad, he's still sleeping, he works nights.

9
00:01:51,243 --> 00:01:52,539
C'mon in.

10
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:04,333
I... uh... finished the color SAP and the digital printing last night.

11
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:08,233
I pulled some line art from the internet,

12
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,059
and printed the imperfections.

13
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:13,430
See, that's kinda my secret, the dust marks and the discoloration.

14
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:16,072
No one's gonna question that detail in a million years.

15
00:02:17,816 --> 00:02:25,870
So, why 29? I mean, if I were you, shave a coupla years off, you could definitely get away with...

16
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:29,037
You're very kind, Tony.

17
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:31,987
Nice work.

18
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:34,954
It's a pleasure doing business with you. If you any of your friends ever need anything...

19
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,978
- Why are you doing this? - Come again?

20
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,199
You're a smart kid, forgery's a felony.

21
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,222
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, six years in jail.

22
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:45,524
Shit, you're... you're a cop?

23
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:49,455
No, I'm about as far from law enforcement as you can get.

24
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,062
I just hate to see wasted potential, Jeff.

25
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:54,269
Tony. It's Tony.

26
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,389
The autographed baseballs in your bedroom... made out to Jeff.

27
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,911
Don't get sloppy, it's the little things that trip you up.

28
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,632
Honey, I'm home.

29
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:38,006
Reese?

30
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,715
Hi!

31
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:00,233
There we go.

32
00:04:01,178 --> 00:04:03,733
You're gonna love the new farm house.

33
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:07,833
Clean air, acres and acres of woods, a mountain stream

34
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,971
You'll feel like a puppy again.

35
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:15,749
Did you know that your great, great, grandmother was born just a few towns over?

36
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:18,135
So was mine, not at the same time, of course.

37
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,201
Oh, I gotta go to work.

38
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:28,384
- Civic Archives, please. - It may take a while, Market's jammed.

39
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:32,158
- Okay, then please take California to Hyde. - There's construction on Hyde.

40
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:35,190
Why don't you stay on this, take this to Golf, Golf to Bush, Bush to

41
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:38,504
Polk, Polk to Grove, and then just leave me on the corner of Market.

42
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:42,438
- You want my job? - You never know.

43
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,671
- Morning, Jennie. - Morning.

44
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,033
- Morning. - Hi, Kenneth.

45
00:05:05,084 --> 00:05:08,668
We thought you might not be coming in today, being New Year's Eve, and all.

46
00:05:08,718 --> 00:05:13,094
Well, it's still a Wednesday, the fun doesn't start 'til tonight anyway.

47
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:17,408
- Well, are you up for a little excitement right now? - Sure, what is it?

48
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:20,954
Your favorite, the newsreel archive, it's finally being digitized.

49
00:05:21,003 --> 00:05:23,878
We need a little help getting it ready to be shipped.

50
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,717
I'd love to.

51
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:52,647
Adaline Marie Bowman was born at twelve-oh-one a.m., January 1st. nineteen-oh-eight,

52
00:06:52,697 --> 00:06:56,161
at Children's Hospital, San Francisco,

53
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:02,439
the only child of Faye and Milton Bowman,

54
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:15,451
On June 16th, 1929, just as Adaline Bowman and her mother stopped to admire the expanse,

55
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:20,050
where three years hence construction would be finished on the Golden Gate Bridge,

56
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:26,220
a young engineer displayed uncommon gallantry

57
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:40,198
Eighty-seven days later Adaline married Clarence James Prescott,

58
00:07:40,223 --> 00:07:43,576
at Old Saint Mary's Cathedral in San Francisco.

59
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:51,144
Three years later Adaline gave birth to a baby girl.

60
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:57,729
They named her Fleming, after Adaline's paternal grandmother.

61
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:05,131
On February 17th, 1937 eight workers and two engineers lost their lives when a section

62
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:09,160
of scaffolding fell through a safety net during construction of the Golden Gate Bridge.

63
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:14,331
Among the deceased was Adaline's husband.

64
00:08:22,214 --> 00:08:25,960
Ten months after her husband's death

65
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:30,509
Adaline was driving north to her parents beach cottage

66
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:33,766
where 5 year old Fleming was waiting up for her,

67
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:39,139
when something highly unusual occurred,

68
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:42,001
something almost magical...

69
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,819
snow fell in Sonoma County, California.

70
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:28,615
The immersion in the frigid water...

71
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,509
caused Adaline's body...

72
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:33,985
to go into an anoxic reflex,

73
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:39,144
instantly stopping her breathing and slowing her heartbeat.

74
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,655
Within 2 minutes,

75
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,127
Adaline Bowman's core temperature...

76
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:48,239
had dropped to 87 degrees...

77
00:09:51,051 --> 00:09:53,896
her heart stopped beating.

78
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:02,393
At 8:55 a bolt of lightning...

79
00:10:02,475 --> 00:10:03,556
struck the vehicle...

80
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:08,801
discharging half a billion volts of electricity...

81
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:11,456
and producing 60,000 amperes of current.

82
00:10:12,092 --> 00:10:14,583
Its effect was threefold.

83
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:20,099
First, the charge defibrillated Adaline Bowman's heart.

84
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:27,153
Second, she was jolted out of her anoxic state

85
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:32,979
causing her to draw her first breath in 2 minutes.

86
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:48,869
Third, based on Von Lehman's

87
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:52,836
principle of electron compression in deoxyribonucleic acid,

88
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:56,702
which will be discovered in the year two thousand thirty-five,

89
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,905
Adaline Bowman will henceforth be immune to the ravages of time...

90
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,047
she will never age another day.

91
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:37,027
As the years passed, Adaline credited her unchanging

92
00:11:37,077 --> 00:11:39,877
appearance to a combination of a healthy diet,

93
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,372
exercise, heredity, and good luck.

94
00:11:42,731 --> 00:11:47,132
- Adaline? - Miriam, hello.

95
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:51,248
- My god, you haven't changed a bit. - Oh, that's very kind of you to say.

96
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:53,379
Fleming, you're all grown up.

97
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:56,003
That's what I keep telling my mom, but she doesn't believe me.

98
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,870
- I'm sorry we really must leave. - But you... you look like sisters.

99
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,955
You better stop or it'll go straight to my head.

100
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,356
- How is that possible? - A new face cream... from Paris.

101
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:10,712
- Made from the royal jelly of the queen bee. - Okay, Darling, bye-bye now, great seeing you.

102
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:21,963
Action was required... just weeks later, when living a quiet suburban existence,

103
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:25,990
Adaline was pulled over for a minor traffic infraction.

104
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:31,106
Ma'am it says here you were born January 1st., 1908.

105
00:12:32,623 --> 00:12:33,768
That's right.

106
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:39,490
- That would make you... 45 years old? - Yes.

107
00:12:39,665 --> 00:12:41,561
Ma'am, I'm gonna hold onto this.

108
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:43,791
When you come by the station house to pick it up,

109
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:45,303
please bring your birth certificate.

110
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:49,517
I'd be happy to, Officer, is tomorrow morning all right?

111
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:50,827
Sure.

112
00:12:53,976 --> 00:13:00,930
Soon after, Adaline moved back to San Francisco and took a clerical job at the School of Medicine.

113
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:12,829
There, she availed herself of every opportunity to research her condition.

114
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:24,356
After a year of intense study, Adaline Bowman was forced to confront the fact

115
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:28,889
that there was absolutely no scientific explanation for her condition.

116
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:34,919
Are you a member of the communist party or have you ever been a member of the communist party?

117
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:46,804
Adaline?

118
00:13:48,456 --> 00:13:50,838
I'm sorry, you have the wrong person.

119
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:54,195
We're from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Miss Bowman.

120
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:57,974
We'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.

121
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:00,587
Why, I've done nothing wrong.

122
00:14:01,398 --> 00:14:04,570
I'm a good American, how dare you bother me at my place of employment.

123
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:05,812
It couldn't be helped, Ma'am.

124
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:09,161
We have no record of your residence. This way please.

125
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:20,157
Nothing to worry about, Miss Bowman, we're just going to run a few tests on you.

126
00:15:27,716 --> 00:15:34,121
If anyone contacts you, tell them that I went to Europe on vacation, that I never came back.

127
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,206
The next time we see each other, I'll have a new identity.

128
00:15:39,225 --> 00:15:43,864
I'll always be your mother, you'll just have to introduce me as your friend.

129
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:49,725
- Mama, no. - It has to be this way... here.

130
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:04,509
To insure the freedom and safety of herself and her daughter

131
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:07,671
Adaline vowed to keep moving,

132
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:14,524
changing her name, residence, and appearance every decade,

133
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:22,412
and never to speak a word of her fate to another living soul.

134
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:35,015
In seven weeks, when Jennifer Larson disappears forever,

135
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:41,237
and Susan Fleisher takes up residence in a remote farmhouse in Ashton, Oregon,

136
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:47,825
Adaline Bowman, beside for one moment of weakness.

137
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:51,246
will have kept her vow for the past 60 years.

138
00:17:03,835 --> 00:17:04,933
Hello, Regan.

139
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,579
Amanda, you're not going to stand me up, are you?

140
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:10,656
You asked me that last year, why don't you trust me?

141
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:12,972
Oh, I just can't believe you haven't got a better offer.

142
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:14,492
Impossible.

143
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:18,000
- I'll pick you up eight? - Actually, that's the other reason I called.

144
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:21,374
The Grand Hotel of Nob Hill is sending a car for me.

145
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:24,018
- Look at you. - Have you ever been there for New Years?

146
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,200
Only once, ages ago.

147
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:27,715
I guess it's pretty lavish.

148
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:31,438
Well, I better get to it then, I'll see you soon.

149
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:32,984
Bye, Regan.

150
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:54,995
Are you hungry?

151
00:17:57,148 --> 00:17:58,148
No?

152
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:02,442
Oh, you just want to come out with me tonight, don't you?

153
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:04,508
Sorry, buddy, it's a girls night.

154
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:40,118
Avery, if you do not remove the hand my knee...

155
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:42,373
My two hands are on the table, Adaline.

156
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,204
Thank you.

157
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:27,215
- Happy New Year. - Oh! Hey, Amanda.

158
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,893
- That was you clapping, wasn't it? - How did you guess?

159
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:33,210
- You've got manners. - We're the last two.

160
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,870
Hey, grab a glass.

161
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:37,834
Tell me, what did I miss?

162
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:39,981
Oh, not much, just some happy chatter.

163
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:41,746
It's funny, no matter how old you get,

164
00:19:42,236 --> 00:19:45,548
New Year's Eve still feels like the one night where anything's possible.

165
00:19:45,573 --> 00:19:46,775
What's your resolution?

166
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,040
Same as always, true love. How about you?

167
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:53,579
To live this year as though it were my last.

168
00:19:53,604 --> 00:19:55,644
Well, you never know, it could be, at our age.

169
00:19:56,183 --> 00:19:58,633
So, Hell yeah, let's live.

170
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,676
Beware, bachelor at three o'clock, we need to stir him up.

171
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:06,530
What's he like?

172
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:08,967
Brown hair, icy blues, mid-30's.

173
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:11,272
How many with you who is kicking out my babies?

174
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:12,327
He's here.

175
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:15,185
- Good evening, ladies. - Welcome to Cougartown.

176
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,071
I know, we don't look a day over 28, you're too kind. What's your name?

177
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:21,397
- Dale... Davenport. - Dale's a painter.

178
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:23,080
- Really? - Yeah, a starving artist, though.

179
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:25,605
Because he doesn't accept his affluent family's help.

180
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,180
I... I'm sorry, have we met?

181
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:31,147
No, no, no, just your Cartier wrist watch, one of the very first.

182
00:20:31,172 --> 00:20:34,541
I'm assuming it was given to you by a well to do grandfather.

183
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:37,784
A great-grandfather, but how do you know I paint?

184
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:41,113
You hands are covered in paint. That one was easy.

185
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,346
Well, Picasso, have a seat, we're gonna buy you a drink.

186
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:47,939
Sure.

187
00:20:47,964 --> 00:20:49,907
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

188
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:50,932
Thank you.

189
00:21:27,655 --> 00:21:30,484
Six, five, four...

190
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:33,249
Three, two, one.

191
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:36,508
Happy New Year!

192
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:40,101
Hello.

193
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,365
Thank you, Sweetheart.

194
00:21:45,756 --> 00:21:47,337
No, no, you don't have to sing.

195
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:50,238
Please, please, don't sing, I've already had enough birthdays.

196
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:53,409
Where are you?

197
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:56,782
You didn't go out at all?

198
00:21:57,757 --> 00:21:59,826
Well, I don't blame you.

199
00:22:00,141 --> 00:22:01,940
Are we still on for tomorrow?

200
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,590
Great, all right, get some sleep. I love you.

201
00:22:06,517 --> 00:22:07,557
Good night.

202
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:21,191
Whoever he is, I hope he has one helluva an excuse.

203
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:22,877
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

204
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:26,301
It's just... isn't there some sort of tradition.

205
00:22:26,326 --> 00:22:29,765
if you're alone on New Year Eve that you're supposed to kiss a stranger?

206
00:22:31,192 --> 00:22:32,936
Damn it, you've heard it before.

207
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:36,917
Just once, from a young Bing Crosby... type.

208
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:39,278
Happy New Year.

209
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,721
- I am too old for this. - Oh, no, don't disappear.

210
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,280
I'll call you tomorrow and you can tell me everything I missed. I love you.

211
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,790
Bye, Beautiful.

212
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,651
That'll teach me not to put my hand where it doesn't belong.

213
00:23:12,481 --> 00:23:13,530
Something tells me it won't.

214
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:19,434
You know, that was a risky move.

215
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:22,451
- What was? - Not introducing yourself before you leave.

216
00:23:23,155 --> 00:23:24,165
I'm a daredevil.

217
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:27,505
I'm Ellis, a pleasure to meet you.

218
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:31,232
- Like the Island? - No man is.

219
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:32,626
I'm Jenny.

220
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:33,895
Like the poem?

221
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:38,878
No? "Say I'm weary, say I'm sad,"

222
00:23:38,903 --> 00:23:42,485
"Say that health and wealth have miss'd me, Say I'm growing old, but add, "

223
00:23:43,637 --> 00:23:44,637
Jenny kissed me."

224
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,936
Who wrote that?

225
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:54,270
- Oh, one of the romantics, I think. - No, you're not sure.

226
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:59,191
Actually, I am, but I don't want to come across like a know-it-all.

227
00:23:59,216 --> 00:24:02,067
Too bad, Henri, I adore know-it-alls.

228
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:08,244
So, where are you off to?

229
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,089
Some place with better food... my apartment.

230
00:24:13,477 --> 00:24:14,477
And yourself?

231
00:24:15,444 --> 00:24:19,387
Back to the party. I just wanted to spend 27 floors with you.

232
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,617
- Well, that was a risky move. - What?

233
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:26,632
Leaving your date upstairs. I hope it was worth it.

234
00:24:26,657 --> 00:24:30,349
- What are you talking about? - Oh, come on, that beautiful woman in blue.

235
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:32,714
Does her name happen to end in "kova"?

236
00:24:34,113 --> 00:24:37,776
No, her name is Agnes Boggs.

237
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:40,321
Her uncle's the chef, I'll let him know you liked his food.

238
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:43,166
And she's not my date.

239
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:52,417
- Taxi, Ma'am? - Yes, please, thank you.

240
00:24:57,545 --> 00:24:58,545
Good night.

241
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:01,460
I'll just wait with you.

242
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,796
So you can find out where I live?

243
00:25:05,131 --> 00:25:07,579
It does make it a lot easier to send flowers.

244
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:12,157
Thank you, but I'll manage.

245
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:17,105
Goodbye, it's been an adventure meeting you.

246
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:22,126
Thank you.

247
00:25:24,094 --> 00:25:25,094
Wait!

248
00:25:26,432 --> 00:25:29,843
There you go again, putting your hand in places it doesn't belong.

249
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,997
- How do we get in touch? - Happy New Year, Ellis.

250
00:25:35,892 --> 00:25:36,892
Thank you, Sir.

251
00:26:01,355 --> 00:26:03,974
- Am I late? - No more than usual.

252
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:05,853
Happy Birthday, Mama.

253
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:07,939
Thank you, Darling.

254
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:13,017
I'm so happy to see you.

255
00:26:16,572 --> 00:26:19,080
You know you don't have to still give me cards.

256
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:24,454
- I love you. - I love you, too.

257
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:28,835
- So, when you are moving back up? - The third week in February.

258
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,620
- Right on schedule. - Of course.

259
00:26:37,051 --> 00:26:39,348
I see you already forgot our little talk about sodium.

260
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,901
No, I am simply choosing to ignore it.

261
00:26:46,181 --> 00:26:51,792
Actually, I'm thinking of moving, myself.

262
00:26:53,802 --> 00:26:55,282
But you love where you live.

263
00:26:55,307 --> 00:26:58,402
I do, but, you know, there's just too many stairs.

264
00:26:59,246 --> 00:27:04,666
Last week Kay Alfonso fell, and she broke her hip.

265
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,925
The doctor said she might never leave the hospital.

266
00:27:09,371 --> 00:27:13,403
And the very next day, Molly Andrews called me,

267
00:27:13,428 --> 00:27:18,554
and she told me about this wonderful retirement community in Arizona.

268
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:22,450
She moved in last spring. She said she's never been happier in her whole life.

269
00:27:26,741 --> 00:27:27,891
What's a matter?

270
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:33,380
We bought in Oregon so that I could be close to you.

271
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:35,945
You could come up for long visits,

272
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,021
move in with me eventually.

273
00:27:39,963 --> 00:27:42,975
We haven't lived together since I was in high school.

274
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,619
A little bit. You're not getting any younger.

275
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:49,310
What if you move to Arizona and something happened to you?

276
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:50,335
What if you get sick?

277
00:27:51,856 --> 00:27:55,025
Then, I would hope that you'd come and take care of me.

278
00:27:58,728 --> 00:28:00,273
What if I'm too late?

279
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:06,988
No, no, we cannot do this, not on your birthday, it's a holiday.

280
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:15,745
I nearly fell off my feet.

281
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,585
What are you two clucking about?

282
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,409
Major news! Mr. Jones is donating fifty thousand

283
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:23,473
dollars worth of first edition classics to this library.

284
00:28:23,498 --> 00:28:26,039
- What books, do you know? - We're going to find out very soon,

285
00:28:26,064 --> 00:28:30,370
because his office called to say that he'll be here to deliver them himself.

286
00:28:31,842 --> 00:28:33,958
- Hi. - Oh no. - I'm Ellis. - Oh, good.

287
00:28:33,983 --> 00:28:36,369
- Welcome, - Thanks. - Mr. Jones.

288
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,059
On behalf of the San Francisco Heritage Society

289
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:44,149
I'd like to express our sincere gratitude for your most generous gift.

290
00:28:44,174 --> 00:28:46,639
I left them in Shipping and Receiving, but I'm sure they'll be right up.

291
00:28:46,664 --> 00:28:50,184
If you don't mind, we'd like a photograph of you donating the books.

292
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:51,340
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

293
00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:54,009
Can you give me one second, though?

294
00:28:56,962 --> 00:29:01,916
Hey, it's me, the know-it-all.

295
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:04,800
- What are you doing here? - I got something for you, too.

296
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,009
Some flowers.

297
00:29:09,926 --> 00:29:12,446
Daisy Miller by Henry James.

298
00:29:12,471 --> 00:29:14,920
Dandelion Wine by Ray Bradbury.

299
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,921
White Oleander, Janet Fitch.

300
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:22,519
Very clever.

301
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,350
How did you know I work here?

302
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:29,714
I just joined the Board, I saw you coming out of our meeting.

303
00:29:31,108 --> 00:29:33,158
You could have mentioned that in the elevator.

304
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,850
If we'd met in a taller building, I'd have had time to cover that.

305
00:29:45,086 --> 00:29:48,755
I don't know about you, but... I'm ready for some donating.

306
00:29:49,384 --> 00:29:51,734
Great, I'll be here.

307
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,919
No way, I'd like for you to accept books on behalf of the Library.

308
00:29:54,944 --> 00:29:57,669
- Oh, no, I can't do that. - Yes, you can.

309
00:29:57,694 --> 00:30:00,072
No, I... I don't want my photo taken.

310
00:30:00,097 --> 00:30:01,624
Don't worry, you look stunning.

311
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:04,849
It's not about vanity, I just don't like people taking my photograph.

312
00:30:07,461 --> 00:30:11,576
Suit yourself, if you won't accept them, I won't donate 'em.

313
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:15,452
- You wouldn't do that. - I will, I'll even have a book burning.

314
00:30:17,887 --> 00:30:21,172
I just... I don't like having my photos taken, Ellis.

315
00:30:23,084 --> 00:30:26,882
Okay, fine, fine. Here's an alternative.

316
00:30:26,907 --> 00:30:28,187
Let me take you out tomorrow.

317
00:30:30,883 --> 00:30:33,803
Okay... that's impossible.

318
00:30:39,908 --> 00:30:43,419
All right, well, I'll just pack up the books then, that's fine.

319
00:30:46,487 --> 00:30:48,067
Where?

320
00:30:51,451 --> 00:30:53,251
Some place you've never been.

321
00:30:54,233 --> 00:30:57,003
Well, if it's in this city, that's unlikely.

322
00:30:58,612 --> 00:31:00,039
Try me.

323
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:04,068
You can leave your boots at the front when you're done,

324
00:31:04,093 --> 00:31:06,516
- I'll be right outside. - We will, thank you, Tom.

325
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,641
All right.

326
00:31:11,974 --> 00:31:14,274
All right... I give up.

327
00:31:16,395 --> 00:31:21,765
In the first year of the Gold Rush, about 60,000 people came to San Francisco by ship.

328
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:26,312
And a lot of them hightailed straight into the hills leaving their boats behind.

329
00:31:26,337 --> 00:31:30,228
Hundreds of boats were left onshore.

330
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:33,866
Downtown San Francisco was built right on top of them.

331
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,239
I didn't know that.

332
00:31:35,264 --> 00:31:40,954
Now... City Services found this when they were digging when they were digging for a utility line.

333
00:31:42,855 --> 00:31:45,921
- My God. - Isn't it something?

334
00:31:47,523 --> 00:31:50,731
- Is... is that...? - Yeah, that's a boat.

335
00:31:50,756 --> 00:31:55,482
Oh! Wow! This is incredible.

336
00:31:55,507 --> 00:31:58,543
So, we had the digging stopped immediately, of course, because

337
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:00,697
we want this made available to the public.

338
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:04,285
- "We" - San Francisco Historical Preservation Society.

339
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,787
Oh, let me guess, you're on the board.

340
00:32:06,812 --> 00:32:09,991
Yeah, well, they'll... they'll let anyone on the Board these days.

341
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:21,596
So, how did you come by your fortune, anyway... inheritance?

342
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:26,107
Luck. I was a math major in college, and

343
00:32:26,132 --> 00:32:31,290
in my spare time I developed an algorithm for analyzing climate data,

344
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:35,581
but my roommate figured out that it could also be used to make economic forecasts.

345
00:32:35,606 --> 00:32:38,538
So he started a company in our dorm room,

346
00:32:38,563 --> 00:32:42,950
sold it 3 years later and then with his half he retired to Fiji.

347
00:32:42,975 --> 00:32:46,181
And with my half, I'm... ya know, I'm doing this.

348
00:32:46,206 --> 00:32:48,619
Your... your job is giving away money.

349
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:52,617
Yeah, that's right, but... but if you want to make a real difference in this world, it's a...

350
00:32:52,642 --> 00:32:54,907
it's a lot harder than it seems.

351
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:59,585
What about you, Jenny?

352
00:33:05,613 --> 00:33:07,623
I own a dog.

353
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:13,119
I should be getting back.

354
00:33:13,144 --> 00:33:14,435
I thought we were having lunch.

355
00:33:15,391 --> 00:33:18,941
It's too late, Ellis, I only have an hour.

356
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:25,286
Let me at least walk you back.

357
00:33:29,838 --> 00:33:34,169
Thank you for all of this, but.. but you should know I'm moving.

358
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,545
I have an idea. I'll tell you a joke, and if you laugh,

359
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:48,789
you have to go out with me one more again before you move away.

360
00:33:48,814 --> 00:33:52,843
And if you don't laugh, I'll know we're incompatible and I'll gladly give up.

361
00:33:52,868 --> 00:33:56,774
- That must be one helluva joke. - It's the funniest in human history.

362
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,349
But it's subtle, sophisticated, so you probably won't even get it.

363
00:34:01,193 --> 00:34:02,342
Yeah, probably not.

364
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,190
Do you like baseball?

365
00:34:04,946 --> 00:34:08,055
- Yeah, I love it. - Good. So...

366
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:13,478
One day at Fenway Park, Ted Williams... Do you know who he was?

367
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:17,999
Oh, c'mon, the Thumper, current batting average .344, right?

368
00:34:18,024 --> 00:34:20,529
What? Yeah, that Ted Williams.

369
00:34:20,554 --> 00:34:22,726
Anyway, so, he's hangin' around Fenway

370
00:34:22,751 --> 00:34:25,693
and this horse walks up and says, "I want to play for the Sox."

371
00:34:25,718 --> 00:34:27,805
- An actual horse? - An actual horse.

372
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,024
so Ted's like, "Okay, what can you do?"

373
00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:33,263
And the horse says, "I can hit just like you, only a whole lot better ".

374
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:37,106
So, he picks up the bat with his teeth and Ted's like, "Okay",

375
00:34:37,131 --> 00:34:39,867
and he throws him a few, and sure enough...

376
00:34:39,892 --> 00:34:42,445
goong, goong, goong!

377
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:43,521
into the bleachers.

378
00:34:44,621 --> 00:34:47,967
So, Ted's like, "Whoa! What else can you do?"

379
00:34:47,992 --> 00:34:50,248
And the horse says, "Well, I can play shortstop."

380
00:34:50,273 --> 00:34:53,640
So, Ted hits him a few ground balls and sure enough

381
00:34:53,665 --> 00:34:55,044
He's a "vacuum cleaner"?

382
00:34:56,727 --> 00:35:00,354
Yeah, so Ted's like, "Whoa! Can you pitch?"

383
00:35:00,379 --> 00:35:01,931
And the horse just looks at him and says,

384
00:35:01,956 --> 00:35:05,476
"Pitch? Who ever heard of a horse pitching?"

385
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,078
Yeah! Yes!

386
00:35:14,103 --> 00:35:19,134
Ladies and gentlemen, the Lady has been conquered.

387
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,491
That's the worst joke I've ever heard in my entire life.

388
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:25,793
- Thank you. - It wasn't a compliment.

389
00:35:25,818 --> 00:35:29,098
Dinner, Tuesday, my place, 303-18th Street.

390
00:35:30,743 --> 00:35:31,743
Eight o'clock.

391
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,157
Fine.

392
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:47,916
Good morning, Miss Larson, good to see you again.

393
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:50,481
- Good morning. - So, what can we do for you today?

394
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:53,185
I'd like to add another signee to my account.

395
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:56,280
- May I ask the reason? - I'll be traveling for a while.

396
00:35:57,287 --> 00:35:58,448
Traveling, huh?

397
00:35:59,186 --> 00:36:02,476
Okay, I'll get the paperwork, I'll be right back.

398
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,989
All of these companies rate very highly with us.

399
00:36:19,014 --> 00:36:21,083
What's this, the Haloid Photographic Company?

400
00:36:21,108 --> 00:36:24,335
They've been around 50 years, they make photo paper and equipment.

401
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,234
They're developing something called "electro photography".

402
00:36:27,259 --> 00:36:30,956
Could revolutionize the business, but you won't see any immediate returns.

403
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:33,182
- Could be a few years away. - That's all right.

404
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:35,665
I'd hate to see you tie up your money.

405
00:36:36,813 --> 00:36:37,813
I'm patient.

406
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,214
What do you know, they changed their name.

407
00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:41,736
They're now called...

408
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,639
What the heck, it starts with an "X", it's...

409
00:36:47,354 --> 00:36:49,624
It's Greek, it's pronounced "XEROX".

410
00:36:50,621 --> 00:36:51,621
Xerox.

411
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,587
So, we can start with the signature card.

412
00:36:57,778 --> 00:37:00,589
- What is the name of the co-signer? - Susan Fleisher.

413
00:37:00,614 --> 00:37:06,063
- Susan, what, F-I-e... - i-s-h-e-r.

414
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:10,154
Now, I made you some salmon.

415
00:37:11,218 --> 00:37:15,457
This no eating nonsense just won't do if you are a proper farm dog.

416
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,363
I want you to eat every last bite, do you understand me?

417
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:24,788
Oh, there we go.

418
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:54,108
Hello? Ellis?

419
00:37:58,703 --> 00:38:01,062
- Am I interrupting? - Hey!

420
00:38:02,704 --> 00:38:06,454
- I was afraid you got cold feet. - No, no, just trouble getting a cab.

421
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:07,911
- Hey. - Hi.

422
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,389
Can I take your coat?

423
00:38:14,228 --> 00:38:15,349
Okay.

424
00:38:17,486 --> 00:38:21,220
Uh, your... your place it's, uh...

425
00:38:21,245 --> 00:38:23,363
- Unfinished? - Yes!

426
00:38:23,388 --> 00:38:27,018
Uh, I noticed that part, it's sort of an artistic choice?

427
00:38:27,654 --> 00:38:32,221
No, I have to paint and plaster and do all the wiring stuff,

428
00:38:32,246 --> 00:38:37,105
but I'm doing it all myself, so, it's gonna take a little while.

429
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,150
- I think your food is burning. - Ah!

430
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:45,559
So, make yourself comfortable.

431
00:38:46,453 --> 00:38:47,663
Sit down, relax.

432
00:38:49,385 --> 00:38:50,416
Okay.

433
00:38:54,321 --> 00:38:57,314
What is it... that you're cooking?

434
00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:02,237
Well, it's a delicacy, which to be honest, is not for everyone.

435
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:05,742
I hope you like it.

436
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,293
- Are you ready? - Would you like a drum roll?

437
00:39:11,428 --> 00:39:12,428
Voilá!

438
00:39:13,778 --> 00:39:16,368
It was between this and stuffed quail.

439
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:18,539
Please don't tell me you're disappointed.

440
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:22,084
- I... I'm truly overjoyed! - Yes!

441
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:24,468
- Dig in. - Okay.

442
00:39:29,504 --> 00:39:34,073
- Well? - Well, it's perfect, just the music is painful.

443
00:39:34,098 --> 00:39:37,285
- You don't like jazz? - No, I love jazz, this is something else.

444
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:45,020
My mom grew up in Maine, she's is a real New Englander.

445
00:39:45,045 --> 00:39:47,895
Sweet, but tough as nails.

446
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:55,037
My dad, on the other hand... has his head in the stars... literally.

447
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:58,798
He's an astronomer, just retired from Stanford.

448
00:39:59,675 --> 00:40:03,215
His claim to fame was that he discovered an unusual comet.

449
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,351
Unusual, in what way?

450
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:08,181
Well, it has a mathematically proven perigee.

451
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:13,084
So, based on his calculation, it will pass by Earth in the winter of 1981.

452
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:15,690
- Did it? - No.

453
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:22,402
No, it did not, but, that didn't stop us from looking for it every year.

454
00:40:22,427 --> 00:40:25,588
It was a kind of a ritual we had when I was growing up.

455
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,740
My dad is still looking.

456
00:40:32,322 --> 00:40:35,552
Well, one more glass of wine and may see it.

457
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:39,757
Oh, no, no, no thank you, please.

458
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:42,650
Ah, c'mon, ya know, they have a saying in Italy,

459
00:40:42,675 --> 00:40:46,514
Anni, amori e bicchieri di vino, nun se contano mai.

460
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:51,987
"Years, lovers, wine cups,"

461
00:40:52,012 --> 00:40:54,851
"years, lovers and glasses or wine,"

462
00:40:54,876 --> 00:40:57,447
"these are things that should never be counted."

463
00:40:59,973 --> 00:41:00,973
You have no idea.

464
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:11,767
- I like your view. - Thank you.

465
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:15,969
I like the way you read.

466
00:41:17,825 --> 00:41:18,825
What?

467
00:41:19,368 --> 00:41:23,009
The first time I saw you, coming out of a board meeting, you were reading.

468
00:41:25,043 --> 00:41:29,438
Your hair was pulled back and you were wearing a blue dress.

469
00:41:29,463 --> 00:41:32,999
It was a book in Braille. I slowed down to watch.

470
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:34,887
How long did you watch for?

471
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:38,282
Long enough to realize you weren't blind.

472
00:41:38,307 --> 00:41:40,303
And that I had to meet you.

473
00:41:40,328 --> 00:41:44,299
And I didn't know when or how, but I... I knew I would.

474
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,100
I think I, uh...

475
00:41:57,591 --> 00:41:59,171
I think I remember that day, uh...

476
00:42:01,412 --> 00:42:04,424
Yes, it was a... it was a book in Norwegian,

477
00:42:04,449 --> 00:42:08,467
and because of all the umlauts over the vowels, it made it nearly impossible to comprehend.

478
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:12,112
- You're kidding. - Yes.

479
00:42:12,752 --> 00:42:14,823
- Are you kidding? - Yes, yes of course I am.

480
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:19,973
It was Braille for beginners, or nursery rhymes or something.

481
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:29,389
You could tell me anything you want and I'll believe it.

482
00:42:30,225 --> 00:42:31,843
I know almost nothing about you.

483
00:42:34,476 --> 00:42:35,909
It's better this way.

484
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:42,545
No... it's not.

485
00:43:03,817 --> 00:43:07,050
Tell me something I can hold on to forever and never let go.

486
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:14,824
Let go.

487
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,640
Hi.

488
00:44:07,225 --> 00:44:08,225
Good morning.

489
00:44:12,472 --> 00:44:16,474
Okay, move your arm, some of us work for a living.

490
00:44:18,404 --> 00:44:22,360
Um, okay, I get it, you're holding me hostage.

491
00:44:26,251 --> 00:44:27,722
Will you ever come back?

492
00:44:36,267 --> 00:44:39,979
Are you sure there's no one there who speaks English, or even Spanish?

493
00:44:40,004 --> 00:44:42,641
No, no, no, we... we want it all.

494
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:45,000
Il curator compare...

495
00:44:45,025 --> 00:44:46,781
- I have to go. - Hold on, hold on.

496
00:44:46,806 --> 00:44:48,109
One minute, please.

497
00:44:48,134 --> 00:44:51,234
Give me a second, okay, I'm trying to deal this in Portuguese.

498
00:44:51,259 --> 00:44:52,259
I can't right now.

499
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:56,537
What are you trying to say?

500
00:44:56,562 --> 00:44:59,988
The Rain Forest Trust Fund's to buy 5,000 acres.

501
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:02,131
Huh, well, you're not even close.

502
00:45:02,156 --> 00:45:03,779
- Here. - Thank you.

503
00:45:04,738 --> 00:45:09,970
We're confirming the purchase of 5,000 acres, is it good?

504
00:45:09,995 --> 00:45:12,042
The check is in the mail.

505
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:13,652
Thank you very much, Sir.

506
00:45:15,152 --> 00:45:16,464
I'm late for work.

507
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:19,121
- Wait. That's it? - Let go.

508
00:45:54,581 --> 00:45:56,360
It's a $1.50, Ma'am.

509
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:07,940
Ma'am?

510
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:10,342
I just changed my mind, just keep driving please.

511
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,101
You got it.

512
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:07,702
Reese.

513
00:47:09,054 --> 00:47:10,054
Reese?

514
00:47:18,155 --> 00:47:21,158
Baby, are you okay?

515
00:47:23,047 --> 00:47:24,272
Are you okay, Baby?

516
00:47:26,732 --> 00:47:32,021
His urean creatine levels are way too high, which means his kidneys are failing.

517
00:47:32,046 --> 00:47:34,883
The toxins are building up and his body can't handle it.

518
00:47:35,491 --> 00:47:36,719
Is he in pain?

519
00:47:38,631 --> 00:47:39,768
It's difficult to say.

520
00:47:41,585 --> 00:47:43,819
If you were me, what would you do?

521
00:47:48,922 --> 00:47:54,641
I'd be thinking about... what a wonderful life he's had,

522
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,476
how lucky you are to have found each other.

523
00:48:08,923 --> 00:48:11,548
May I have a moment alone with him, please?

524
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:13,454
Of course.

525
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:54,793
Hey Jenny! This is Ellis. I tried you a couple of times.

526
00:48:54,818 --> 00:48:57,870
Hope you got my messages. Call me back.

527
00:50:55,923 --> 00:50:56,923
Jenny!

528
00:50:59,451 --> 00:51:00,552
What are you doing here?

529
00:51:02,022 --> 00:51:04,663
- Well, I tried to call, but... - How did you get my address?

530
00:51:07,243 --> 00:51:08,243
The library.

531
00:51:10,592 --> 00:51:13,483
Come on, don't be upset, I didn't know what else to do.

532
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:20,485
My dog, I had to...

533
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:24,763
- I had to put him down. - Oh, no, I'm so sorry to hear that.

534
00:51:24,788 --> 00:51:27,102
You should have waited for me to contact you.

535
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:30,888
- Uh, Jenny, I'm s... - There's a reason I don't give out my address.

536
00:51:30,913 --> 00:51:35,086
- I'm... I'm sorry, honestly. - This isn't going to work, I'm moving.

537
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:36,276
Are you serious?

538
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,962
Hi... for you.

539
00:52:01,636 --> 00:52:05,678
Barbara Ireland before she moved to Florida,

540
00:52:05,703 --> 00:52:07,643
she got rid of all her books.

541
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,498
I could no sooner get rid of this book than I could...

542
00:52:17,043 --> 00:52:20,725
Well, it looks like I'm not the only one getting nostalgic.

543
00:52:21,717 --> 00:52:23,666
You've had such a wonderful life.

544
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,031
I like to think so.

545
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:32,833
I just wish you... you know, that she could have been there for more of it.

546
00:52:33,773 --> 00:52:34,853
So do I.

547
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:39,438
Remember that?

548
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:43,237
Nineteen fifty-four I was junior in college.

549
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:45,467
That's the last photo I have of you.

550
00:52:46,161 --> 00:52:48,208
Well, when you've seen one, you've seen 'em all.

551
00:52:49,177 --> 00:52:50,378
This is true.

552
00:52:57,626 --> 00:52:58,626
What is it?

553
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,424
What's wrong?

554
00:53:01,968 --> 00:53:04,022
I'm just tired of running,

555
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:08,966
of lying to good people.

556
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,899
Then stop.

557
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:14,048
Nobody's chasing you anymore.

558
00:53:14,499 --> 00:53:17,519
Anyone who was ever been suspicious is long dead.

559
00:53:18,314 --> 00:53:21,037
You don't have to be alone forever.

560
00:53:22,153 --> 00:53:24,816
Don't you miss having someone to love?

561
00:53:25,229 --> 00:53:26,967
It's been such a long time.

562
00:53:26,992 --> 00:53:29,528
Well, it's not the same when there's no future.

563
00:53:29,553 --> 00:53:32,030
What are you talkin' about, you got nothin' but future!

564
00:53:32,055 --> 00:53:35,678
I mean a future together, growing old together.

565
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:38,486
Without that, love is, uh...

566
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,051
it's just heartbreak.

567
00:53:42,076 --> 00:53:44,206
It's the same for everybody.

568
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,775
How many times has my heart been broken?

569
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,800
Too many.

570
00:53:49,233 --> 00:53:53,994
If I had your looks and your energy, I'd fall in love tomorrow, I really would.

571
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:59,173
- I did meet someone. - What?

572
00:53:59,198 --> 00:54:02,026
Oh, on New Year's Eve, he... he jumped on my elevator.

573
00:54:02,051 --> 00:54:04,892
- Why didn't you tell me? - Because I knew you'd look at me like that.

574
00:54:06,765 --> 00:54:11,511
Don't get too excited, I, uh... I told him to leave me alone.

575
00:54:12,424 --> 00:54:15,611
I was horrible... cruel.

576
00:54:15,636 --> 00:54:18,759
Tell him you're sorry, tell him you made a mistake.

577
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:20,632
I can't, I'm leaving.

578
00:54:21,566 --> 00:54:24,843
You're moving to Oregon, not Timbuktu.

579
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:31,279
Come on, if you won't do it for yourself, do it for me.

580
00:54:32,266 --> 00:54:33,266
Please?

581
00:54:44,886 --> 00:54:46,715
- Hello. - Can I help you?

582
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:51,653
Uh, I'm here to see Ellis Jones, he's not expecting me.

583
00:54:51,678 --> 00:54:54,305
Well, let's see what we can do about that.

584
00:54:55,189 --> 00:54:56,189
And you are?

585
00:54:57,943 --> 00:54:59,275
Incredibly sorry.

586
00:55:00,995 --> 00:55:03,234
Mr. Jones, you got a guest down here.

587
00:55:03,542 --> 00:55:06,314
- I bet you got a name. - Jennifer Larson.

588
00:55:07,745 --> 00:55:11,293
Please, tell him I understand if he doesn't want to see me.

589
00:55:11,318 --> 00:55:13,236
I'm here just to say I'm sorry,

590
00:55:14,288 --> 00:55:18,685
and that my... my life has been unbelievable,

591
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:21,161
since longer than he can imagine,

592
00:55:21,186 --> 00:55:24,791
and I just... I was emotional the other day, and...

593
00:55:26,403 --> 00:55:29,828
Now that I realize how incredibly kind to me he's been,

594
00:55:29,853 --> 00:55:33,288
and I... I... I've just been too stupid to accept it, and...

595
00:55:33,313 --> 00:55:34,840
I know better now, and... and

596
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,870
that's why I want to tell him how sincerely sorry I am.

597
00:55:40,742 --> 00:55:45,102
- Okay. - And ask that... if he could come downstairs maybe, and...

598
00:55:45,127 --> 00:55:49,052
let me make it up to him by taking him out tonight?

599
00:55:49,954 --> 00:55:51,420
Please.

600
00:55:52,341 --> 00:55:57,961
Uh, Jennifer Larson, she says she understands if you don't...

601
00:55:57,986 --> 00:56:01,787
Oh, you heard that? Okay, good.

602
00:56:01,812 --> 00:56:03,755
He wants to know where you're taking him?

603
00:56:05,419 --> 00:56:07,863
Some place he's never been before.

604
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:35,826
- Hello. - Hey, Jenny.

605
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:36,752
C'mon.

606
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:48,056
All right, you don't actually think this is my first chop shop do you?

607
00:56:48,081 --> 00:56:52,828
Oh, be quiet, there's more here that meets the eye.

608
00:56:52,853 --> 00:56:56,042
This used to be one of the most popular picture houses in the City.

609
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,101
- Movie theater? - Yes.

610
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:04,573
In the 1930s, a woman named Mary Elizabeth Woods,

611
00:57:04,598 --> 00:57:09,619
read about a chemical magnate who had created the drive-in theater in Camden, New Jersey.

612
00:57:10,266 --> 00:57:14,029
And, so naturally she made one of her own here in San Francisco.

613
00:57:14,054 --> 00:57:17,012
Everyone thought she was crazy as a loon, which she was.

614
00:57:17,037 --> 00:57:19,085
She would sleep with anyone who wasn't her husband,

615
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:22,969
and she used to put on these airs like she was better than anyone else. In fact...

616
00:57:25,372 --> 00:57:26,026
...anyway.

617
00:57:27,355 --> 00:57:30,731
Because of local ordinances she couldn't have an open-air theater,

618
00:57:30,756 --> 00:57:32,890
so she brought all the car in here.

619
00:57:32,915 --> 00:57:34,430
That's the screen, right there!

620
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:39,376
It was spectacular... I imagine.

621
00:57:43,145 --> 00:57:45,191
- Are you ready for the best part? - Sure.

622
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:47,163
Okay, look up.

623
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:01,142
She had photo luminescent filaments installed.

624
00:58:03,262 --> 00:58:06,598
They took the time to create the constellations.

625
00:58:09,122 --> 00:58:10,343
Isn't it beautiful?

626
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,220
Yeah.

627
00:58:26,266 --> 00:58:27,266
What are you doing?

628
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:29,170
C'mon.

629
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:42,889
Cheers.

630
00:58:44,086 --> 00:58:47,006
The great paradox of all this is that...

631
00:58:47,031 --> 00:58:50,531
the better our instruments get, that farther we can see.

632
00:58:51,836 --> 00:58:55,496
But not into the future, into the past.

633
00:58:55,521 --> 00:58:58,222
The events who's light hasn't even reached us yet.

634
00:58:58,247 --> 00:59:01,734
I don't think I'll ever understand why so few people care about history?

635
00:59:02,268 --> 00:59:05,071
The future has its charms, too.

636
00:59:07,132 --> 00:59:08,679
We could talk about our ours.

637
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:14,203
- Ellis... - Not the distant future.

638
00:59:15,004 --> 00:59:18,968
- Talk about this weekend. - What did you have in mind?

639
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:23,535
My parents are having a party to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary.

640
00:59:24,814 --> 00:59:26,488
It's just a couple of hours from here.

641
00:59:29,056 --> 00:59:30,056
Come with me.

642
00:59:45,355 --> 00:59:47,285
Okay.

643
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,085
Can I drive?

644
00:59:58,653 --> 01:00:03,387
Oh, my God, you know you rarely see a Saab in the Daytona 500.

645
01:00:03,941 --> 01:00:05,372
There's a reason for that.

646
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:10,092
Then... ya know, you might wanna consider an occasional tap on that square pedal by your foot.

647
01:00:10,117 --> 01:00:11,774
I don't know what you're talking about.

648
01:00:11,799 --> 01:00:20,537
Oh, my God! Oh, sorry! What's wrong with you?

649
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,053
Do me a favor, stop and pick her up.

650
01:00:30,078 --> 01:00:34,603
- Ooh, I'd rather not get stabbed. - That's my sister.

651
01:00:38,604 --> 01:00:39,903
Sorry.

652
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,299
- What's up pussycat? - Need a ride?

653
01:00:47,879 --> 01:00:48,879
What's it look like?

654
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:55,376
- How are you? - Good, hi!

655
01:00:56,113 --> 01:00:59,398
Get out! Still driving the Saab, huh?

656
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:01,127
- Yeah, it's good to see you, too. - Hey!

657
01:01:01,152 --> 01:01:05,003
Kikki, this is Jenny. Jenny, this is my sister.

658
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:06,798
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

659
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,086
You should have told me you were taking the bus.

660
01:01:09,473 --> 01:01:10,907
We'd of picked you up at the station.

661
01:01:10,932 --> 01:01:13,031
I stopped using telephones 2 months ago.

662
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:15,960
Any particular reason?

663
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:20,859
To protest the involvement of telecomm firms in the development of hi-tech weapon systems.

664
01:01:22,737 --> 01:01:24,407
Kikki graduated from Berkeley.

665
01:01:26,055 --> 01:01:28,814
So this is the new one, huh?

666
01:01:30,452 --> 01:01:32,004
Have you done him yet?

667
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,660
Yes, 10 minutes ago, right where you're sitting.

668
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:43,115
So what's the story with this girl, she... she works there?

669
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,890
I told everything Ellis told me.

670
01:01:48,423 --> 01:01:49,423
Thank you.

671
01:01:49,908 --> 01:01:51,031
Beautiful girl,

672
01:01:53,533 --> 01:01:55,519
working in a public library.

673
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:58,672
Maybe she likes books... and silence.

674
01:01:58,697 --> 01:02:00,331
Or maybe she Google'd him,

675
01:02:00,356 --> 01:02:03,959
and found out about his generous contributions and then...

676
01:02:03,984 --> 01:02:06,828
worked her way in there so she could get her hooks into him.

677
01:02:06,853 --> 01:02:08,029
Yeah, I'll bet that's it.

678
01:02:08,723 --> 01:02:11,544
- Shouldn't they be here by now? - You clear the table.

679
01:02:22,624 --> 01:02:23,664
They're here!

680
01:02:24,144 --> 01:02:25,144
Yeah, yeah.

681
01:02:25,847 --> 01:02:26,847
How do I look?

682
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:29,970
Very pretty.

683
01:02:35,973 --> 01:02:37,449
Oh! There you are!

684
01:02:37,474 --> 01:02:38,613
Hey, Mom.

685
01:02:39,363 --> 01:02:43,883
- Aaw, Honey! You look great. - Look who we picked up on the way.

686
01:02:43,933 --> 01:02:45,629
Hi, Baby.

687
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:49,316
- So, this is Jenny. - Hello.

688
01:02:49,341 --> 01:02:51,197
- So nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

689
01:02:51,222 --> 01:02:53,043
You must be exhausted after your trip.

690
01:02:53,068 --> 01:02:56,538
Oh, no, it was nothing. We made it in like 18 minutes.

691
01:02:56,563 --> 01:03:00,858
No I'm not amused. He knows I hate it when he speeds.

692
01:03:00,883 --> 01:03:04,418
It wasn't me, it was Jenny, I swear, she thinks she has nine lives.

693
01:03:04,443 --> 01:03:05,459
Let me take your coat.

694
01:03:05,484 --> 01:03:06,990
- Oh, okay. - Where ya been?

695
01:03:07,015 --> 01:03:09,667
- What, you forget where we live? - No.

696
01:03:10,984 --> 01:03:13,062
Uh, this is my dad, William.

697
01:03:13,087 --> 01:03:16,096
- Dad, this is... - Adaline.

698
01:03:22,806 --> 01:03:23,806
Jenny, actually.

699
01:03:29,011 --> 01:03:30,841
Dad, you okay?

700
01:03:33,591 --> 01:03:34,939
I'm sorry, it's just...

701
01:03:35,894 --> 01:03:39,392
you look exactly like this old friend of mine that I...

702
01:03:39,925 --> 01:03:41,124
Adaline Bowman.

703
01:03:43,914 --> 01:03:44,914
That's my mother.

704
01:03:47,383 --> 01:03:48,919
You joking? Really?

705
01:03:48,944 --> 01:03:50,890
- Yeah. - Oh, my gosh!

706
01:03:50,915 --> 01:03:51,915
Did you know her?

707
01:03:55,975 --> 01:03:58,214
Yeah! Yeah!

708
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:03,578
We were very close, I... I knew her in London.

709
01:04:04,288 --> 01:04:07,321
Yeah, yes she lived there in the 60s.

710
01:04:07,346 --> 01:04:09,282
Right before she, ah...

711
01:04:09,307 --> 01:04:12,059
moved to Paris and met my father.

712
01:04:12,084 --> 01:04:13,878
Incredible, what are the odds?

713
01:04:13,903 --> 01:04:16,011
Wow, wow.

714
01:04:16,036 --> 01:04:20,415
The resemblance is absolutely amazing. You must hear it all the time.

715
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,200
For as long as I can remember.

716
01:04:23,225 --> 01:04:25,229
Wow! We were very close.

717
01:04:25,254 --> 01:04:29,326
You've just said that already. I don't believe you never mentioned her.

718
01:04:29,351 --> 01:04:30,999
Oh, yeah, I must've...

719
01:04:31,024 --> 01:04:34,600
No, no... no, I remember your close, close friends.

720
01:04:34,651 --> 01:04:36,009
How she doin'?

721
01:04:38,618 --> 01:04:42,448
She passed away... 6 years ago.

722
01:04:42,987 --> 01:04:43,987
No, really?

723
01:04:45,893 --> 01:04:48,424
Oh, wow, I'm so sorry.

724
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:56,123
An extraordinary woman.

725
01:04:56,148 --> 01:04:58,928
Yeah, well, it runs in the family.

726
01:05:04,929 --> 01:05:06,619
- Come on, want something to eat? - Yeah.

727
01:05:06,644 --> 01:05:08,564
Yeah, I made cheesecake.

728
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:12,710
We're kinda tired actually.

729
01:05:13,557 --> 01:05:15,842
I think we'll head up, if that's okay with you?

730
01:05:15,867 --> 01:05:17,216
- Me too. - Really?

731
01:05:17,257 --> 01:05:18,879
All right, I have you in the back bedrooms.

732
01:05:18,904 --> 01:05:20,393
Ha! You're in the back.

733
01:05:22,052 --> 01:05:22,995
- Hey. - Hey.

734
01:05:23,457 --> 01:05:25,298
It's so nice to meet you.

735
01:05:25,697 --> 01:05:29,546
- Dad... - Oh, hey.. hey, Baby.

736
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:31,454
Miss.

737
01:06:32,925 --> 01:06:33,925
Miss.

738
01:06:35,661 --> 01:06:37,429
You know, you keep doing that, you gonna flood your engine.

739
01:06:37,454 --> 01:06:39,633
Thank you, thank you for the useful tip.

740
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:42,046
Well, you gonna get one hell of a tan at least.

741
01:06:45,773 --> 01:06:49,664
I'm sorry, I've done everything I could to get this thing started.

742
01:06:50,899 --> 01:06:51,899
It won't work.

743
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:54,907
All right, all it needs is a push-start.

744
01:06:56,023 --> 01:06:58,351
Just loose the brake, I'll give you a push,

745
01:06:58,376 --> 01:07:00,227
Pop your clutch and you'll take off.

746
01:07:02,065 --> 01:07:03,065
Okay.

747
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:06,188
Thank you.

748
01:07:08,675 --> 01:07:10,111
- Ready? - Ready, you ready?

749
01:07:10,136 --> 01:07:11,036
- Okay. - Okay.

750
01:07:13,491 --> 01:07:14,650
Okay! Now pop your clutch.

751
01:07:17,781 --> 01:07:18,821
Thank you!

752
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:23,230
You're welcome.

753
01:07:41,529 --> 01:07:44,270
They would spend the next five weeks together.

754
01:07:44,303 --> 01:07:48,373
And Adaline did something that she promised herself she would never do.

755
01:07:48,638 --> 01:07:51,707
You know, you... you still haven't told me your name.

756
01:07:53,818 --> 01:07:55,028
Adaline Bowman.

757
01:07:56,343 --> 01:07:59,022
- But my friends call me Della. - That's beautiful.

758
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:01,130
Thank you.

759
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:07,360
Three weeks later, his semester completed, William flew home to the United States.

760
01:08:09,675 --> 01:08:11,976
Adaline, came with him.

761
01:08:55,977 --> 01:08:56,977
Hey.

762
01:08:58,584 --> 01:08:59,808
How'd you sleep?

763
01:09:00,388 --> 01:09:01,939
- Fine. - Good.

764
01:09:09,424 --> 01:09:13,360
Sorry about last night, I didn't mean to embarrass you, it's just...

765
01:09:15,804 --> 01:09:17,614
I must be losin' it.

766
01:09:18,315 --> 01:09:19,315
It's okay.

767
01:09:24,864 --> 01:09:26,294
- Hey! - When did you come up?

768
01:09:27,255 --> 01:09:30,484
- Not too late, I read for a while. - Hmm...

769
01:09:32,128 --> 01:09:33,128
- Hi, Baby. - Mwah!

770
01:09:34,568 --> 01:09:37,256
- Where's Jenny? - She'll be down in a sec.

771
01:09:37,281 --> 01:09:39,112
She was up all night, tossing and turning.

772
01:09:40,482 --> 01:09:42,833
You know, you've never told us how you guys met.

773
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,279
We met in an elevator on New Year's Eve.

774
01:09:47,542 --> 01:09:50,239
- You want some coffee? - No, thank you.

775
01:09:50,264 --> 01:09:52,881
But, I'd seen her once before that.

776
01:09:53,546 --> 01:09:54,379
Hey.

777
01:09:54,404 --> 01:09:57,880
It was at the library, she was reading a book on Braille and I just

778
01:09:57,905 --> 01:09:59,622
I knew she was an original.

779
01:09:59,647 --> 01:10:01,774
Here you go, Baby. So was her mom.

780
01:10:02,604 --> 01:10:04,114
How did you meet her mother?

781
01:10:05,404 --> 01:10:11,000
It was outside London. Her car broke down, I helped her fix it.

782
01:10:11,025 --> 01:10:15,376
So, she was English? Oh, no, no she was just there studying French.

783
01:10:15,401 --> 01:10:18,787
- Spoke like what, four languages? - I think so.

784
01:10:18,812 --> 01:10:19,976
- Wow. - Yeah.

785
01:10:20,001 --> 01:10:22,371
- Jenny's brilliant with languages, too. - Really?

786
01:10:22,775 --> 01:10:25,725
So, how old were you when you met her?

787
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:27,426
Oh, I was about, uh...

788
01:10:27,451 --> 01:10:30,326
Let's see, that was the second year of med school, so I was like...

789
01:10:30,788 --> 01:10:32,360
Twenty-six.

790
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:37,409
I was thinkin' about quitting medicine... bored.

791
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:39,367
But I was...

792
01:10:40,686 --> 01:10:43,317
I was afraid I was too old to start over.

793
01:10:45,014 --> 01:10:46,014
I told...

794
01:10:47,472 --> 01:10:50,800
I told Adaline about it and she laughed in my face.

795
01:10:50,825 --> 01:10:57,117
She said, "Go for it, don't be silly, life's too short.

796
01:10:57,142 --> 01:11:02,098
Wasn't for her I'd probably wouldn't've found astronomy, physics.

797
01:11:02,123 --> 01:11:05,237
She was only couple of years older than I was but she was so wise.

798
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:07,102
She was so...

799
01:11:07,127 --> 01:11:08,188
I don't know... sophisticated.

800
01:11:16,971 --> 01:11:17,971
She, uh...

801
01:11:32,213 --> 01:11:35,344
- What? Honey? - That's enough, William.

802
01:11:35,369 --> 01:11:38,220
What? What's... what's cooking?

803
01:11:38,245 --> 01:11:39,955
What, you think this is funny?

804
01:11:40,412 --> 01:11:42,578
What do you mean? I'm do... What did I do?

805
01:11:42,603 --> 01:11:47,313
You were very close, you were very close, you said that to me twice now.

806
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:50,930
And you should see your face when you talk about her.

807
01:11:50,955 --> 01:11:53,854
Are you going to wax nostalgic this whole god damn weekend?

808
01:11:53,879 --> 01:11:56,060
Look, it's just that...

809
01:11:56,085 --> 01:11:57,454
she looks so much like her mother that...

810
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:01,405
that I'm remembering things that I didn't even know I remembered.

811
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:04,191
Well, I'd hate feeling like second choice.

812
01:12:04,216 --> 01:12:05,853
- What do you mean? - Especially this weekend.

813
01:12:05,878 --> 01:12:07,415
- Second choice? - Yes.

814
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,260
Forty years, Baby, come on...

815
01:12:10,285 --> 01:12:11,896
Second choice? Uh-uh.

816
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:15,314
Honey, you're blowing this all out of proportion.

817
01:12:15,339 --> 01:12:16,339
Am I?

818
01:12:17,056 --> 01:12:18,417
Are you jealous?

819
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,965
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

820
01:12:23,688 --> 01:12:27,408
Look, look, it was fleeting,

821
01:12:28,557 --> 01:12:29,984
inconsequential.

822
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:34,403
Sounded like you were more than that.

823
01:12:37,449 --> 01:12:38,559
I love you.

824
01:12:39,659 --> 01:12:42,199
- I love you, too. - Come on.

825
01:13:01,295 --> 01:13:02,295
I'm coming!

826
01:13:04,575 --> 01:13:07,501
It's not the most romantic weekend.

827
01:13:07,526 --> 01:13:09,441
Thanks for being such a good sport.

828
01:13:09,466 --> 01:13:12,305
- Of course! - I promise I'll make it up to ya.

829
01:13:25,854 --> 01:13:28,374
Sorry about my dad, it's really embarrassing.

830
01:13:29,856 --> 01:13:30,856
He's lovely.

831
01:13:33,505 --> 01:13:35,995
Yeah, your mom must've really been something.

832
01:13:38,154 --> 01:13:39,433
Yeah, she was.

833
01:13:46,793 --> 01:13:47,793
Kikki!

834
01:13:49,744 --> 01:13:54,244
So, guys, Dad is running a 47 game winning streak.

835
01:13:54,944 --> 01:13:59,009
All the money I spent on your education, I was hoping for stronger competition.

836
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:01,154
- Have you played this before? - No never.

837
01:14:01,164 --> 01:14:03,589
- Kikki, come on! - Do I have to?

838
01:14:03,614 --> 01:14:05,003
- Yeah! - Yes!

839
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:09,438
The idea is to get enough of these little wedges.

840
01:14:09,463 --> 01:14:11,183
- Pie. - They're cheese.

841
01:14:11,744 --> 01:14:16,454
They're wedges, you get enough of 'em to fill-up your circle then you win, okay?

842
01:14:16,555 --> 01:14:19,429
Most of the questions are about this stupid stuff.

843
01:14:19,454 --> 01:14:21,018
Hence the word "Trivial".

844
01:14:21,043 --> 01:14:22,687
Yeah, like here's an example for you, umm...

845
01:14:23,118 --> 01:14:28,929
"On June 22, 1938, this American boxer retained his heavyweight championship"

846
01:14:28,954 --> 01:14:31,763
"when he beat Max Schmeling in the first round."

847
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:35,651
- Well, that is a tough one. - I know, what do you think?

848
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:40,142
Sony Liston?

849
01:14:40,753 --> 01:14:43,049
- Joe Louis. - Good guess though, really.

850
01:14:43,911 --> 01:14:46,682
Women and boxing, it's cute.

851
01:14:46,723 --> 01:14:48,451
Excuse me, do you know what then?

852
01:14:49,648 --> 01:14:51,770
You know what, finally ladies we're on the team.

853
01:14:51,795 --> 01:14:53,701
- Here, roll the die. - Here we go. - All right.

854
01:14:53,726 --> 01:14:54,713
Here we go.

855
01:14:55,375 --> 01:14:56,375
Women are pink.

856
01:14:57,281 --> 01:14:58,377
Women are pink?

857
01:15:02,515 --> 01:15:06,148
"Who was the first United States President to be born in a hospital."

858
01:15:06,173 --> 01:15:07,074
Jimmy Carter.

859
01:15:11,649 --> 01:15:12,424
Jimmy Carter.

860
01:15:14,273 --> 01:15:15,273
That's fast.

861
01:15:15,593 --> 01:15:18,373
- Beginners luck. - I don't think so, try again.

862
01:15:22,004 --> 01:15:25,075
"At what event did the 'Hula Hoop' make its debut?"

863
01:15:26,348 --> 01:15:31,678
In 1956, at the World's Fair in Schenectady, New York.

864
01:15:35,284 --> 01:15:38,158
1956 World's Fair, Schenectady, New York.

865
01:15:38,183 --> 01:15:39,874
Oh, my God.

866
01:15:41,283 --> 01:15:42,934
- Nice one! - Wow.

867
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:46,189
- Cheese. - Pie.

868
01:15:46,837 --> 01:15:48,391
Wedge.

869
01:15:50,354 --> 01:15:53,359
All right, come on, do this.

870
01:15:53,384 --> 01:15:54,490
Oh, a lotta pressure.

871
01:15:54,515 --> 01:15:57,428
Smell somethin', like your winning streak going up in smoke?

872
01:15:58,572 --> 01:16:01,054
We've got this family joke, what would happen first,

873
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:06,249
Dad loses in Trivial Pursuit, or Della finally appears?

874
01:16:08,016 --> 01:16:09,239
Della?

875
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:12,555
Yeah, you remember the comet I told you about, the one that my dad discovered?

876
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:15,460
He named it Della C 1981,

877
01:16:16,408 --> 01:16:19,052
after my great Aunt Adele.

878
01:16:19,303 --> 01:16:20,860
- Okay, let's go. - Yeah?

879
01:16:20,885 --> 01:16:23,576
- Dad, come on. - Here we go.

880
01:16:23,601 --> 01:16:25,217
Jenny.

881
01:16:26,163 --> 01:16:27,442
For the win...

882
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:34,780
"Of what country was Albert Einstein offered the presidency in 1952?"

883
01:16:40,654 --> 01:16:41,654
Israel.

884
01:16:44,523 --> 01:16:45,523
Israel.

885
01:16:51,683 --> 01:16:54,299
It's okay, I still love you.

886
01:16:54,324 --> 01:16:57,908
How does it feel dad? Are you sad?

887
01:16:58,608 --> 01:16:59,608
I'm all right.

888
01:17:01,902 --> 01:17:06,687
Let's look at page 2, okay? That's section 3, paragraph H.

889
01:17:07,686 --> 01:17:10,000
- I'm sorry. - It's okay, I'm going out for a walk.

890
01:17:10,034 --> 01:17:11,034
Shure.

891
01:17:18,346 --> 01:17:21,050
Yes, let's look at page 10.

892
01:17:40,712 --> 01:17:43,212
How many stars do you think there are in our galaxy?

893
01:17:46,548 --> 01:17:48,438
I don't know, five hundred million.

894
01:17:50,398 --> 01:17:52,706
Couple a hundred billion.

895
01:17:58,468 --> 01:18:05,058
Plato believed that every soul has a companion star it that returns to after death...

896
01:18:05,658 --> 01:18:07,589
if you lived a moral life.

897
01:18:08,487 --> 01:18:09,487
You believe that?

898
01:18:10,596 --> 01:18:12,751
No, no, I'm a...

899
01:18:13,143 --> 01:18:18,420
I'm a scientist, Plato was a philosopher... poet.

900
01:18:24,977 --> 01:18:26,955
Why did you name your Comet after my mother?

901
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:35,686
If my calculations were correct, that turned out to be wrong,

902
01:18:36,067 --> 01:18:42,182
it would've been the closest approach to Earth of any comet in 200 years.

903
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:50,522
In other words, like your mother, a near miss.

904
01:18:52,502 --> 01:18:53,992
What does that mean?

905
01:18:59,022 --> 01:19:01,078
I was gonna propose her.

906
01:19:05,304 --> 01:19:10,134
I had... I had an engagement ring in my pocket.

907
01:19:13,109 --> 01:19:14,605
She stood me up.

908
01:19:19,977 --> 01:19:21,091
Near miss.

909
01:19:22,673 --> 01:19:23,673
Good night.

910
01:19:31,149 --> 01:19:32,152
William.

911
01:19:36,499 --> 01:19:37,928
She loved you, too.

912
01:19:59,857 --> 01:20:00,857
Wow.

913
01:20:02,343 --> 01:20:06,023
We just met, right? I know that.

914
01:20:08,596 --> 01:20:10,777
Yeah, I should probably shut up right now.

915
01:20:15,397 --> 01:20:16,536
I'll just shut up.

916
01:20:17,384 --> 01:20:18,946
Come on, what?

917
01:20:24,401 --> 01:20:25,279
What is it?

918
01:20:25,304 --> 01:20:28,922
I... I... I... I just gotta tell you the truth, I...

919
01:20:29,731 --> 01:20:31,900
I can't imagine my life without you.

920
01:20:33,107 --> 01:20:36,313
I know it's probably the last thing wanna hear right now, but,

921
01:20:38,784 --> 01:20:40,825
I'm falling in love with you, Jenny.

922
01:20:41,817 --> 01:20:42,992
I can't help it.

923
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:50,130
I don't know what to say.

924
01:20:54,259 --> 01:20:56,114
I deal with all of this with respect.

925
01:20:56,139 --> 01:20:59,961
Please, do not say anything, all right? I just wanted you to know how I feel.

926
01:21:17,796 --> 01:21:20,525
- Oh, hello. - Jenny.

927
01:21:22,025 --> 01:21:23,311
Do you know where everyone went?

928
01:21:23,902 --> 01:21:28,450
Yeah, Kathy and Kikki went to the market and Ellis went for a... for a run.

929
01:21:28,475 --> 01:21:32,163
- Well, okay. - You have a bug in your hair.

930
01:21:32,188 --> 01:21:33,339
- Sorry, it's all right, it's a... - What it is?

931
01:21:33,441 --> 01:21:34,979
It's a ladybug.

932
01:21:36,434 --> 01:21:37,929
They say they're good luck.

933
01:21:39,906 --> 01:21:40,906
Did you get it?

934
01:21:42,576 --> 01:21:44,825
- Got it. - Thank you.

935
01:21:49,641 --> 01:21:51,873
Please tell Ellis that I went for a walk.

936
01:22:39,835 --> 01:22:41,915
- Della, you okay? - Oh, my God!

937
01:22:57,746 --> 01:22:59,881
- This is gonna sting. - Okay, okay.

938
01:23:11,548 --> 01:23:13,092
Don't worry, we'll fix you up.

939
01:23:46,749 --> 01:23:48,336
Excuse me... hi.

940
01:23:49,054 --> 01:23:50,927
- Do you mind taking our photo? - Sure.

941
01:23:52,169 --> 01:23:53,919
It's okay, I don't, I don't.

942
01:23:53,944 --> 01:23:55,641
- This is gonna be great. - I don't want it.

943
01:23:55,666 --> 01:23:58,960
- You're gonna love it? - No, we're wasting film.

944
01:24:00,256 --> 01:24:01,491
I'm just really shy.

945
01:24:01,639 --> 01:24:04,302
Three, two, one...

946
01:24:55,077 --> 01:24:56,077
I know.

947
01:24:58,809 --> 01:25:01,003
I know who you are, Adaline.

948
01:25:03,801 --> 01:25:04,801
What?

949
01:25:07,342 --> 01:25:12,841
The scar... the same scar, I stitched it myself.

950
01:25:14,547 --> 01:25:15,547
Please.

951
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:19,380
The truth.

952
01:25:29,383 --> 01:25:30,383
William.

953
01:25:38,437 --> 01:25:40,588
I thought I was losing my mind.

954
01:25:43,444 --> 01:25:47,164
How? How is this possible?

955
01:25:52,201 --> 01:25:53,639
I don't... I don't know.

956
01:25:55,889 --> 01:25:58,600
I...I, I was normal.

957
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:03,815
And then one day... I just stopped.

958
01:26:06,613 --> 01:26:11,389
I wanted to tell you so badly, but I couldn't.

959
01:26:12,401 --> 01:26:14,128
You know what they'd do to me, I...

960
01:26:14,808 --> 01:26:17,222
- I would have been a... - Curiosity.

961
01:26:19,804 --> 01:26:21,007
- A specimen. - Yes.

962
01:26:26,797 --> 01:26:33,065
That's why you left? That's why you... disappeared?

963
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:41,570
You can't imagine how much it hurt.

964
01:26:44,798 --> 01:26:48,284
I think, I... I think I can.

965
01:26:53,017 --> 01:26:57,243
- You've never told anyone? - No.

966
01:26:58,583 --> 01:27:01,565
If I had, it would have been Ellis.

967
01:27:06,891 --> 01:27:09,669
Don't, don't run away.

968
01:27:10,547 --> 01:27:13,514
Don't disappear again, please... for Ellis.

969
01:27:14,751 --> 01:27:16,571
- Adaline... - Please.

970
01:27:19,443 --> 01:27:23,641
All these years, you've lived but you've never had a life.

971
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:30,275
Please, for yourself, for Ellis, stay, Adaline.

972
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,609
I don't know how.

973
01:27:33,226 --> 01:27:35,717
Don't run away, Adaline. Adaline!

974
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,440
Adaline!

975
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,692
Adaline don't, don't. Adaline, please.

976
01:28:58,782 --> 01:28:59,933
Please don't do this.

977
01:29:00,018 --> 01:29:03,619
Adaline, don't. Think about Ellis, please!

978
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:06,937
Adaline, please! Adaline!

979
01:29:32,374 --> 01:29:35,971
Ellis, I'm so sorry. I can't do this. I can't explain. Jenny.

980
01:29:44,305 --> 01:29:46,879
Dad! Dad!

981
01:29:48,046 --> 01:29:49,249
Dad, where're your keys?

982
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:55,068
She's gone.

983
01:30:01,593 --> 01:30:03,808
She's not coming back, Son.

984
01:30:04,284 --> 01:30:07,758
What just happened? What, what... what is this?

985
01:30:08,718 --> 01:30:11,633
- Dad, what the hell did you say to her? - Nothing.

986
01:30:14,337 --> 01:30:15,761
She can't explain.

987
01:30:16,808 --> 01:30:19,035
Please tell me what she said.

988
01:30:21,656 --> 01:30:25,058
- She's not capable. - Of what?

989
01:30:30,555 --> 01:30:32,496
Of change.

990
01:30:59,183 --> 01:31:00,183
Do you love her?

991
01:31:01,703 --> 01:31:02,703
Son?

992
01:31:03,828 --> 01:31:06,058
Listen to me. Do you love her?

993
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:07,958
Yes.

994
01:31:10,934 --> 01:31:11,934
How do you know?

995
01:31:13,311 --> 01:31:16,331
- Dad, I don't... - It's a simple question.

996
01:31:17,035 --> 01:31:18,035
How do you know?

997
01:31:21,053 --> 01:31:22,954
Because nothing makes sense without her.

998
01:32:28,782 --> 01:32:30,397
- Hello. - Oh.

999
01:32:30,422 --> 01:32:32,489
Darling, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.

1000
01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:35,607
- Everything okay? - No, no... I just wanted to tell you...

1001
01:32:35,632 --> 01:32:36,569
What is it?

1002
01:32:37,903 --> 01:32:40,051
You're right, no more running.

1003
01:32:40,076 --> 01:32:43,447
- Mom? - I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

1004
01:32:43,472 --> 01:32:46,046
- I'm so happy to hear that. - I love you.

1005
01:32:46,071 --> 01:32:48,015
- I love you too. - Bye.

1006
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:49,040
Bye, Mama.

1007
01:34:02,777 --> 01:34:07,289
The moon is responsible for much of what takes place on the surface of the Earth.

1008
01:34:08,165 --> 01:34:12,342
A stray meteor hit the Moon in 1178.

1009
01:34:12,833 --> 01:34:15,425
The resulting concussion would cause extreme tides

1010
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:18,728
on every lunar phase in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina.

1011
01:34:19,662 --> 01:34:23,181
A 23% rise in the mean tide on this night

1012
01:34:23,832 --> 01:34:27,977
produced a storm 2000 miles off the Pacific coast,

1013
01:34:28,735 --> 01:34:32,942
causing an increase in amount of molecular ionization in the atmosphere.

1014
01:34:34,565 --> 01:34:37,052
And for the first time in 78 years,

1015
01:34:38,435 --> 01:34:42,045
snow fell in this part of Sonoma County.

1016
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:48,911
In the first stages of hypothermia,

1017
01:34:48,936 --> 01:34:52,777
the body will try to generate heat through shivering.

1018
01:34:53,706 --> 01:34:58,196
When this fails, it would decrease the flow of blood to the extremities.

1019
01:34:59,922 --> 01:35:02,827
Metabolism slows to a crawl.

1020
01:35:04,178 --> 01:35:06,876
You're dying, but you don't know it.

1021
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:10,065
In the final stages...

1022
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:13,872
the victim only breathes once or twice a minute.

1023
01:35:14,914 --> 01:35:18,031
A state of suspended animation.

1024
01:35:44,811 --> 01:35:45,811
Jenny!

1025
01:35:46,728 --> 01:35:53,531
At 10:07 p.m., Adaline Bowman's core temperature had dropped to 87 degrees.

1026
01:35:55,148 --> 01:35:57,803
Her heart stopped beating.

1027
01:36:20,137 --> 01:36:24,110
At last, at the age of one hundred and seven,

1028
01:36:24,992 --> 01:36:29,518
Adaline Bowman was, by any definition, dead.

1029
01:36:39,064 --> 01:36:42,577
At precisely 10:09 p.m., paramedics placed

1030
01:36:42,602 --> 01:36:45,897
two defibrillator paddles on Adaline Bowman's chest.

1031
01:36:47,643 --> 01:36:53,612
They counted the prescribed 5 seconds before administering 750 volts of electricity.

1032
01:38:09,885 --> 01:38:10,885
How is she?

1033
01:38:10,910 --> 01:38:14,993
We've just run a series of tests and don't see any long term damage.

1034
01:38:15,594 --> 01:38:17,234
It's quite remarkable, in fact.

1035
01:38:17,543 --> 01:38:19,307
Is she awake? Can I go see her?

1036
01:38:19,332 --> 01:38:22,598
She's exhausted but you might be able to get in a few words.

1037
01:38:22,623 --> 01:38:24,842
Okay, thank you.

1038
01:38:42,147 --> 01:38:43,147
Hi.

1039
01:38:47,961 --> 01:38:49,203
Jenny.

1040
01:38:50,684 --> 01:38:52,984
- Hi. - Hey!

1041
01:39:08,163 --> 01:39:09,946
I know why you ran away.

1042
01:39:12,662 --> 01:39:13,662
You do?

1043
01:39:14,621 --> 01:39:17,211
It's because of what I said to you last night, isn't it?

1044
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:20,445
I told you I loved you.

1045
01:39:21,463 --> 01:39:22,951
- And you got scared, I shouldn't... - Come here, I love you.

1046
01:39:22,976 --> 01:39:25,250
Come here, come here, I love you.

1047
01:39:34,582 --> 01:39:36,371
I love you, too.

1048
01:39:56,287 --> 01:39:58,123
There's something else.

1049
01:40:05,821 --> 01:40:08,548
What? What is it?

1050
01:40:17,099 --> 01:40:21,929
Well, first, my name isn't Jenny.

1051
01:40:33,828 --> 01:40:35,949
My God, what happened?

1052
01:40:35,974 --> 01:40:38,542
Nothing, nothing, an accident, I'm fine. Okay?

1053
01:40:38,567 --> 01:40:39,695
- But... - Hey...

1054
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:41,797
I'm better than fine. Okay?

1055
01:40:44,423 --> 01:40:46,050
- This is Ellis. - Hello.

1056
01:40:46,075 --> 01:40:49,930
- Hello. - He's the man, I've been telling you about.

1057
01:40:54,129 --> 01:40:55,349
Nice to meet you.

1058
01:40:58,252 --> 01:41:00,737
I'm Jenny's grandmother.

1059
01:41:09,276 --> 01:41:11,339
What? What is it?

1060
01:41:13,416 --> 01:41:14,308
He knows.

1061
01:41:20,026 --> 01:41:21,026
He knows.

1062
01:41:42,551 --> 01:41:45,736
Hey, everybody, I don't wanna ruin the party, but I wanna say something.

1063
01:41:45,761 --> 01:41:47,816
First of all, thanks for being here.

1064
01:41:47,841 --> 01:41:51,155
Kathy and I are really grateful that you could all be here.

1065
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:55,025
It means a lot to us that you would be here and to help

1066
01:41:55,050 --> 01:42:00,189
us celebrate the first... first 40 years of our marriage.

1067
01:42:01,702 --> 01:42:04,551
When I first met this lovely lady,

1068
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:07,600
back in the olden days,

1069
01:42:08,458 --> 01:42:14,565
I had a... I had a pretty good idea what I wanted to do in my job,

1070
01:42:14,590 --> 01:42:17,810
but I didn't really...

1071
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:22,039
know what I wanted to...

1072
01:42:22,064 --> 01:42:27,255
be as a man when I grew up, if I ever grew up.

1073
01:42:29,203 --> 01:42:32,783
But the commitment that she made...

1074
01:42:33,468 --> 01:42:37,298
to our marriage and to our family, to me...

1075
01:42:37,909 --> 01:42:41,770
the... quality of her love...

1076
01:42:43,716 --> 01:42:48,927
led me to understand that I could have no greater ambition...

1077
01:42:48,952 --> 01:42:56,504
in life, than to be the best possible husband I could be for her.

1078
01:42:56,529 --> 01:42:59,011
And I'm still working on it.

1079
01:43:01,338 --> 01:43:07,395
So here's to Kathy, love of my life,

1080
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:11,840
mate of my soul, mother of my lovely children.

1081
01:43:13,905 --> 01:43:14,924
To Kathy.

1082
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,664
We are back, live in Times Square.

1083
01:43:31,689 --> 01:43:34,855
And now, only a few minutes from the moment we've all been waiting for,

1084
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:40,662
- ... drop ball... to 2015. - There ya are, Honey, good girl. Yeah.

1085
01:43:44,554 --> 01:43:48,594
Hey, you guys, you better hurry up, you're gonna be late for the event.

1086
01:43:48,619 --> 01:43:51,966
- Yeah, I've been ready for 10 minutes. - Oh, so handsome.

1087
01:43:51,991 --> 01:43:54,090
- Thank you. - I'm ready, too.

1088
01:43:54,957 --> 01:43:57,177
- Wow. - I just need this zipped.

1089
01:43:57,830 --> 01:43:59,371
Are you sure you don't wanna come with us?

1090
01:43:59,396 --> 01:44:01,040
I'm positive.

1091
01:44:02,199 --> 01:44:05,369
I've got my date, right here. Come here, Baby.

1092
01:44:07,699 --> 01:44:09,477
- I love you. - Love you.

1093
01:44:09,502 --> 01:44:12,634
I have to grab my clutch. Oh, and my camera.

1094
01:44:12,659 --> 01:44:15,779
- He's getting so big. - Yeah.

1095
01:44:49,359 --> 01:44:51,778
Adaline, you okay?

1096
01:44:55,825 --> 01:44:56,825
Yes.

1097
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Perfect.

1098
01:45:05,117 --> 01:45:09,266
The instant Adaline's heart was struck by the defibrillator paddles,

1099
01:45:10,042 --> 01:45:13,681
the telomere structures in her genes regained their pliability,

1100
01:45:14,428 --> 01:45:17,758
Causing her to resume the natural course of aging.

1101
01:45:19,184 --> 01:45:21,073
William was right after all,

1102
01:45:21,698 --> 01:45:24,988
the comet, Della C 1981, finally did return.

1103
01:45:25,719 --> 01:45:32,480
A half century late. but as bright and magnificent as he had predicted.
