00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:58,781
<i>We get the wheels,
we get</i> la feria,

2
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,812
<i>we keep moving on.
No messing around.</i>

3
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,039
<i>You mess those wheels up
this time, Chong,</i>

4
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:03,064
<i>I'm gonna have your ass.</i>

5
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:04,148
<i>Move!</i>

6
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:07,016
<i>- Right there, homes.
- There's nobody, homes.</i>

7
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,295
<i>Where's your party, boy?</i>

8
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,787
<i>Turn down the radio.</i>

9
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:11,346
You inviting the cops, too,
or what?

10
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:12,498
I want <i>El Cromo.</i>

11
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:15,585
Gonna get some green

12
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,162
for this shit right here, homes.

13
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,831
Fuck.

14
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,168
Hey.

15
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:40,439
Uh, guys?

16
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:44,109
Those are chrome-plated lugs.
You're gonna strip them.

17
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:45,392
Look at this guy, eh?

18
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,113
The plating flakes off.

19
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,367
Yeah?

20
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,326
This is a lease. No one's
gonna pay to ride...

21
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:04,500
Shit.

22
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:10,131
Come on, man.

23
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,187
Uh, guys. 'Guys-

24
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:17,518
MAN 1; What the fuck?

25
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:20,225
Guys, seriously,
you don't wanna do this.

26
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,230
Take him out.

27
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,078
MAN 1; Fuck him up!

28
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:43,589
No! Not the car!

29
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:48,715
Get that puto!

30
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:50,092
Fuck him up, man!

31
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:53,549
Fuck him up!

32
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,432
Get him!

33
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:58,892
Hit that fool!

34
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,019
Motherfucker!

35
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,638
Shit.

36
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:58,869
Fuck.

37
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,296
<i>Everyone's asleep, Burt.</i>

38
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,218
<i>Sleepwalking.
Between the ice caps,</i>

39
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,672
<i>the pornographers,
poisoned water, mutants...</i>

40
00:04:56,214 --> 00:04:57,306
<i>ifs all connected.</i>

41
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,804
<i>Hey, Clyde. ITS 2029.</i>

42
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:02,520
<i>Why are we still
talking about mutants?</i>

43
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:06,061
Hey, it's me. I'm in the car.

44
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:07,567
Yeah, it was a good trip.

45
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:10,236
Killed it up and down the fence.

46
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,897
USA! USA! USA!

47
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:19,658
USA! USA! USA! USA!

48
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,274
Wolverine.

49
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:51,227
I knew it was you.

50
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:53,730
Oh, fuck.
Please!

51
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,568
I'm in trouble!

52
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:57,943
You're the only one
that could help!

53
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:01,704
Get the fuck away from me!

54
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:07,956
Please!

55
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,213
Logan!

56
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,459
Who was that?

57
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,470
I don't know, some crazy lady.
Don't worry.

58
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,575
As I live and breathe,
the Wolverine.

59
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:26,869
And he's a junkie now.

60
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:28,499
Who the fuck are you?

61
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:32,162
You know, you got some
buckshot in your door.

62
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,038
I heard you was in Phoenix.

63
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,049
But then, last night,
some friends of mine

64
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,296
in Texas HP called...

65
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,711
and told me they found

66
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:42,013
three dead cholos
in a pullout on 54.

67
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:45,300
Not unusual, I know.

68
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,969
Except one was missing a
hand, another one a leg.

69
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:50,555
So they was thinking...

70
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,725
it was either an escaped
tiger or Freddy Krueger.

71
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,315
But neither one of them
can drive...

72
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:59,481
one being fictional,
the other one extinct.

73
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,820
And since the wheel lugs
they found

74
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,822
belonged to a '24 Chrysler...

75
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:05,991
and, well...

76
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,581
this is a '24 Chrysler.

77
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,501
She found you yet?

78
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,832
Gabriela?

79
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,085
See...

80
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:19,751
I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.

81
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,340
Well, not really.
I'm looking for someone

82
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,763
who's looking for you.

83
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:27,762
She took something of mine
when I wasn't looking.

84
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,769
Something for which
lam responsible.

85
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:33,515
Mexican lady.

86
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,392
Has her sights on you now.

87
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,237
Doesn't ring any bells?

88
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:41,488
I don't know any Gabriela,

89
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:42,941
so get the fuck out of my car.

90
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:44,734
Oh.

91
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:46,823
You know...

92
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,780
I know
what you're hiding, amigo.

93
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,038
The old cue ball
south of the border.

94
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:54,956
What do you want?

95
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,712
A little co-operation.

96
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,636
I'm a fan, by the way.

97
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,349
Fuck, fuck!

98
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:20,816
No, Mr. Esperanza, no.

99
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,985
I know I said June,
but I need the boat now.

100
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,650
Why would that mean
the price go up'?

101
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,910
Listen to me.

102
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:29,912
I know you wanted 70...

103
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:31,381
Okay, what if I could
put together

104
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,407
$45,000 cash right now?

105
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,167
Hello? Hello?

106
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:36,452
Shit.

107
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:40,915
Hey, Sam.

108
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:42,083
Morning.

109
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,520
<i>Mucus</i>

110
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,385
"I know that virtue
to be in you, Brutus."

111
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:37,055
"As well as I do know
your outward favor."

112
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,519
"Well, honor is the subject
of my story."

113
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,150
He's having a bad day.

114
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,685
They're all bad days.

115
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,695
He needed these six hours ago.

116
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,738
This is not enough, you know.

117
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,196
Won't see us through the week.

118
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,534
I'm working on it.

119
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:57,867
Your turn.

120
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:00,169
I've had a rough night.

121
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:02,871
Poor you.

122
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:09,341
In other news'
he told me last night

123
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,700
he's communicating with someone.

124
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,761
He's not talking to anybody.

125
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,220
Don't be so sure.

126
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,385
He's got all these details.

127
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:19,101
I thought that tank was
supposed to act <i>as</i> a barrier.

128
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,435
It's got them cracks in it.

129
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:21,770
Just please stop.

130
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:23,434
Bottom left.

131
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,529
You're not listening.

132
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,946
He's been asking questions
again about why we're here.

133
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,785
I think he's trying to
read my mind.

134
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,244
That's what these are for.

135
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,457
<i>Eating his curds and whey</i>

136
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,294
<i>Then came a big spider
Which sat down beside her</i>

137
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:46,616
<i>And frightened Miss Muffet...</i>

138
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:02,265
Friends, I have
good news for you today!

139
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,808
It's not about what you do.

140
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,976
It's not about your deeds.

141
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,562
You can't
live up to God's rules.

142
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:11,733
He knows that you can't.
It's okay, we're imperfect.

143
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,494
Make way, sir.

144
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:17,829
I said make way!

145
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:21,117
The new Quesalupa
from Taco Bell!

146
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,627
Get it with chicken!
Get it with steak!

147
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,834
And with the cheese baked
right in the shell...

148
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,794
it's the next big thing!

149
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,959
Go now while supplies last.

150
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,837
Who are you?

151
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:34,589
You know who I am.

152
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,099
You're the man
who puts me to sleep.

153
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,475
We both could use some sleep.

154
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,011
No! No!

155
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,650
What are you doing to me?

156
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:47,726
Charles.

157
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,188
Come on, now.

158
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,365
How long have I been here?

159
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,091
What are these?

160
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,565
You remember what they are.

161
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,512
The shots mellow the seizures.

162
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,264
The pills
keep them from happening.

163
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,430
How about you blow on them
to make them safe?

164
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:07,723
Fuck off, Logan.

165
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,392
So you remember who I am now.

166
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,902
I always know who you are.

167
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:14,564
It's just sometimes
I don't recognize you.

168
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:16,903
Take the pills.

169
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:25,457
You leave me alone
with that fucking albino.

170
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,118
He doesn't listen to me.

171
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,416
I know a damn speciation
when I see one.

172
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:31,580
A what?

173
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:34,796
Speciation.
New mutant, a young one.

174
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:36,770
There are forces
trying to kill them.

175
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:38,637
Forces?
They want help.

176
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,299
Forces, forces.

177
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,809
It's too bad you're not
in that business anymore.

178
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,595
They don't want me,
they want you.

179
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:52,151
Oh, yes, that's how
fucking stupid they are.

180
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,154
They're waiting for you
at the Statue of Liberty.

181
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,566
The Statue of Liberty
was a long time ago,

182
00:14:58,649 --> 00:14:59,992
Charles, a longtime.

183
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,161
There are no new mutants.
Understand?

184
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,494
Hasn't been a new one born
in 25 years. Not anywhere.

185
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,125
You always thought...

186
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,953
we were part of God's plan.

187
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:15,833
But maybe...

188
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,511
Maybe we were God's mistake.

189
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:32,108
What a disappointment you are.

190
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,152
When I found you...

191
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:40,157
you were pursuing a career
<i>as</i> a cage fighter.

192
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,528
A warm capper to a life
as an assassin.

193
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,947
Hooked on barbiturates.

194
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,366
You were an animal.

195
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,035
But we took you in.

196
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,830
I gave you a family.

197
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,290
And they're gone now.

198
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,374
Logan.

199
00:15:58,876 --> 00:15:59,877
Logan...

200
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,547
What did you do?

201
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:07,226
What did you do?

202
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,478
Answer me!
Why are we here?

203
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,388
No one should live like this.

204
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:12,977
Drugged in a fucking tank!

205
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,232
It's for your own good.

206
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,396
No, it's not!

207
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,073
You're waiting for me to die.

208
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,675
I don't wanna fight...

209
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,508
but there's things
we need to discuss.

210
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:08,930
What things?

211
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,969
Well, would it be
considered nagging...

212
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,771
if I was to repeat
my previous observation...

213
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,523
that the dose is too low
to suppress the seizures?

214
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,269
It's what the guy gave me.

215
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,689
Wasn't in a position
to make demands.

216
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:26,277
I almost died this morning.

217
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,001
That seizure was...
It was barely a minute.

218
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,169
It felt a lot longer than a minute.
I couldn't breathe.

219
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,536
You're less affected.

220
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,538
You know he needs a higher dose.

221
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,496
And I know you got more
money sq squirreled away.

222
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:37,927
That money's
to get us out of here.

223
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,703
No, not us.
You and him.

224
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,497
You're saving
to buy a Sunseeker.

225
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,006
"Sun" is the keyword.

226
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:46,385
I hardly see myself cowering
below decks like Nosferatu.

227
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,544
Do you?

228
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:51,466
Folding your underpants,
and making him spotted dick.

229
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,842
Found this in your pocket.

230
00:18:58,347 --> 00:18:59,894
Adamantium.

231
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,328
If you are planning
to blow your brains out...

232
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:05,163
could you wait till you're
out on the high seas?

233
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:06,439
I just mopped these floors.

234
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:07,906
I don't need this shit.

235
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,999
A year ago, you asked
me to help you.

236
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,922
And God knows I've tried.

237
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,710
But I can't help you,
Logan, not really...

238
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,387
if you're not
going to talk to me.

239
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,053
I hear you at night.
You're not sleeping.

240
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,889
You don't wanna talk about that.

241
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,763
Or the booze you're drinking.

242
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,853
Or the pus you're wiping
away from your knuckles.

243
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,936
Or the blood
I wash from your clothes.

244
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,442
Or the fresh wounds
in your chest.

245
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,945
The ones that aren't healing.

246
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:52,533
And I'm pretty sure...

247
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,711
you don't wanna talk
about the fact

248
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,612
that you can't read
the label on that bottle.

249
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,532
It says, "Ibuprofen."

250
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:01,789
That was my favorite mug.

251
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,128
Stay out of my shit.

252
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,757
Somethings happening
to you, Logan.

253
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,510
On the inside you're sick.
I can smell it.

254
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,556
Best <i>night</i> ever!

255
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:21,979
Hey, driver.

256
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:42,584
I love you.
I love you.

257
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,416
You're such a doll.

258
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,727
Mr. Logan.

259
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:43,933
Oh, Jesus.

260
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,685
Please. We need a ride.

261
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,724
Not available.
Call a cab.

262
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:48,931
My name is Gabriela Lopez.

263
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,161
I don't wanna
know your name, lady.

264
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,653
There are men after us.

265
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:53,289
We need to get out of here.

266
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,031
Go north, cross to Canada.

267
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,737
Anyone can do that job.

268
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,901
I'll give you $50,000.

269
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,154
How did you find me, huh?

270
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:01,864
'Cause you are fucking up
my life, lady!

271
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,249
The people after you,
they're on my ass now!

272
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,535
Sightings were posted.

273
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:07,748
Laura, go inside.

274
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,086
What sightings?

275
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,973
People said someone who
looked like the Wolverine

276
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,999
was in El Paso, driving.

277
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,759
Said he looked old.

278
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:18,968
Hey!

279
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,095
I told you
to stop it with that ball!

280
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,384
Bad girl!
No, please.

281
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,098
I told you, bad girl!
No, please.

282
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:25,363
Mamacita's gonna
have to pay for that.

283
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,388
Stop, please. No.

284
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,766
Shit!

285
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,582
They're gonna
have to pay for damages.

286
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,406
And she has cash.

287
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:37,566
I've seen it.

288
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,418
You should get your fat ass
back in your office.

289
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:40,443
You'll get your money.

290
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,365
Don't let her call anyone,
please.

291
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,580
They will find us.
They will kill us.

292
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,131
I am a nurse.

293
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,798
Was. In Mexico City.

294
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:03,425
When did that happen?

295
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:06,978
This morning.
Near the border.

296
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,983
I got away from them, but...

297
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,312
now they know my car.

298
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,405
Look, I gotta go.

299
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,787
No, wait. Please. Here.

300
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,329
Please, wait! Look.

301
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,241
Look. Here, take this.
It's $20,000.

302
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,585
Here. Take us
to this address.

303
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:34,172
You can have $30,000 more
when we get there.

304
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,626
My friends there
will give it to you.

305
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,594
They will be waiting.

306
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,013
They will give you anything.

307
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,303
Where did you get this?

308
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:45,809
My boyfriend.

309
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,309
He wants to kill me
and take her.

310
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,021
And that's your daughter?

311
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,020
Yes.

312
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,159
I know you're still good inside.

313
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:04,398
I know you want to help us.

314
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,504
You don't know
anything about me.

315
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:06,529
Please!

316
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:09,867
I promise, there will be
no problems if we leave now.

317
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,956
I can't just leave
to North Dakota!

318
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,620
We have to be there Friday.
Or what?

319
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,381
Or we miss our chance to cross.

320
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:18,004
Please.

321
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,214
You have to. Please.

322
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:24,805
Please.

323
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:34,065
I like those.
Huh?

324
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,942
They make you look younger.

325
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,740
Charles, listen.

326
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,405
I gotta go away
for a few days, okay?

327
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,404
I got a long ride
for some good money...

328
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,450
but when I get back,
we're gonna get outta here.

329
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,541
We're gonna
drive down to Yelapa.

330
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:52,896
We're gonna
get ourselves a boat.

331
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,912
And we're gonna
go live on the ocean.

332
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:57,080
Will you be safe there?

333
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:01,551
Yeah. We'll be safe.

334
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,303
Look what Logan got us, Charles.

335
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:10,935
Be back in a few days.

336
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,263
Shit.

337
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,005
Logan.
Yeah?

338
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:29,343
What happened?

339
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:30,883
Did something go wrong?

340
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:32,517
The job was wrong to begin with.

341
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:54,030
Logan!

342
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,493
Logan!

343
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,707
What?

344
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,877
Who does this belong to?

345
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:10,551
Who's that?

346
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:17,054
Thought you were supposed to
see shit coming.

347
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,392
I can track mutants.

348
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,557
I'm a glorified truffle pig,
not a clairvoyant.

349
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,396
Go inside
and keep Charles quiet.

350
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:23,860
Go inside now!

351
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:34,988
You need to turn around,
asshole.

352
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,072
This is private property.

353
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:37,456
Yes, it is.

354
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:39,910
In fact, I believe it belongs

355
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:41,581
to a multinational
smelting company...

356
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,121
based in Shanghai.

357
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,966
Where are you keeping
the old man? Hmm?

358
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,593
Is he over there?

359
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:52,426
Or is he there?

360
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,591
That'd be smart.

361
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:58,390
I'd like to meet him.

362
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:01,181
I'm told the HSA
classifies his brain

363
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:03,312
as a weapon
of mass destruction now.

364
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,269
Damn shame,
what happened back east.

365
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:08,775
He's been dead for a year.

366
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,071
I need the girl.

367
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:13,280
What girl?

368
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:15,563
The one that goes along with
that ball you're holding.

369
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,617
There's no girl here.

370
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,453
I know you went to the motel.

371
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:20,833
Yeah, I was called there.

372
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:22,915
There was no girl.
It was just the woman.

373
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,580
Just the woman.
Such as she was.

374
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:29,926
So, you saw Gabriela.

375
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:34,506
But you didn't call me.
That hurts.

376
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:37,732
You didn't shoot
the poor thing, did you?

377
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,926
No, did you?

378
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:40,144
I asked you first.

379
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:41,395
I don't like guns.

380
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:42,638
Of course.

381
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:46,184
I wish you'd called me, Logan.

382
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:47,523
Like I asked.

383
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:51,819
See?

384
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:54,029
You're not the only one
that's been enhanced.

385
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,956
Logan. Logan!

386
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,120
This is Laura.

387
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:07,830
Caliban, come!

388
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:10,800
This is who
I've been telling you about.

389
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,677
This is Laura.

390
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,213
We've been waiting for you.

391
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:21,302
Come, come here.

392
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:23,855
It's okay.

393
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:25,348
Come.

394
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:28,066
Laura.

395
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:32,697
It's okay. It's okay.

396
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:35,817
Come.

397
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,068
Come.

398
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:42,325
Come. It's okay.
You can stay here, Laura.

399
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:43,825
It's safe.

400
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:45,577
We can look after you here.

401
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:47,203
Come on.

402
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:51,250
Looks like ex-military.
Bounty hunter, maybe?

403
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:52,417
Worse.

404
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,882
Is he by himself?

405
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,091
Yeah, not for long.

406
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:58,348
You get him back in his ride,

407
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,050
take him out to the wash
and dump him.

408
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,889
What if he wakes up
before I get there?

409
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:09,184
Text me where you are.
We'll pick you up.

410
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:23,906
Yes.

411
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:29,078
Logan.

412
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,414
Logan.
Hey. Hey!

413
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:34,042
You'll get it back
after I figure out

414
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,765
what you and your mother
have got us into.

415
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,135
No, Logan.
What?

416
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:38,296
I think the...

417
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:50,357
Logan, the woman that you
met, that's not her mother.

418
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,645
So she talks'?
We're communicating.

419
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,063
Communicating.

420
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:57,899
Take these now.

421
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:01,490
We have to get out of here.
It's not safe here anymore.

422
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,812
And you can't have an attack
out there, you understand?

423
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:08,119
Yes, but this is the mutant
that I told you about.

424
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:10,036
She needs our help.
She's not a mutant.

425
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:11,295
Yes, she is!

426
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:12,546
What's her gift, Charles?

427
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,173
Eating? Pipe throwing?

428
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,302
It's okay.

429
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:39,823
Oh, yeah.

430
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:41,905
Take the gun.
Dump the body.

431
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:44,162
Text me when you're
on the way back.

432
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,600
You have anything else you need?

433
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:47,328
Food for the kid?

434
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,206
You're fucked now, mutie.

435
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:06,725
It's okay.

436
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:10,684
- Choc-choc.
- It's not a choo-choo.

437
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,357
It's okay. Sit down.

438
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,862
We gotta go.
What?

439
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,567
What's going on? Where'?
Stay here.

440
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,198
Don't move.
Where are we going?

441
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:24,736
Hey, don't worry.
He will be back for you.

442
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:31,618
Logan, the girl. You've got
to go back for the girl.

443
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:39,050
Logan, what about the girl?

444
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,882
Logan.

445
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:50,599
Logan, we mustn't forget
about Laura.

446
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,104
She's not our problem.

447
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:01,689
Shit!

448
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,157
Ah, shit!

449
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:40,986
Logan.

450
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:42,271
Yeah, I'm thinking.

451
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:43,485
The child.

452
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:45,946
Logan, we mustn't forget Laura.

453
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,280
Please be quiet.
Logan.

454
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:52,536
Huh.

455
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,458
Charles Xavier.
Where's Caliban?

456
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:56,960
America's most wanted
octogenarian.

457
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,621
I'm a nonagenarian, actually.

458
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:05,628
Ah.

459
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:08,548
Where's Caliban?

460
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:12,194
Why don't you tell me
where the girl is first?

461
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:14,141
Or I could ask Cue Ball.
He seems quite friendly.

462
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:15,805
Hold you, she's not here.

463
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:18,225
Where's Caliban, motherfucker?

464
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,661
Well, I left him
in the same ditch

465
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:21,811
he was gonna leave me in.

466
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:39,374
Jesus, Wolverine,

467
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,497
seeing you like this
just breaks my damn heart.

468
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:43,624
As soon as I rip it out
of your chest, fuck-stick.

469
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:52,842
Go get her.

470
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:07,082
Laura.

471
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:12,964
That a girl!

472
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:15,424
Hey, Dab'!-

473
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:26,019
Laura.“

474
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:30,026
Laura!

475
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:33,192
Honey, you wanna stay
where you are.

476
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:35,286
You wanna see
your friends, right?

477
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:38,164
Command, stop.

478
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,658
You said alive or dead.

479
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:42,952
Laura!

480
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,621
Laura.

481
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:48,374
Laura.

482
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:50,293
No. No.

483
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:53,554
Move! Go!

484
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:00,501
Move! Go!

485
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:06,480
Stop shooting!

486
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:09,737
She heals! Move! Go!

487
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,857
Holy shit!

488
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:58,527
Gotcha!

489
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:08,246
Ah!

490
00:38:09,872 --> 00:38:10,964
Come on, hold her down.

491
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:05,641
As I told you, Logan,
she's a mutant like you.

492
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:07,142
Hold on!

493
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:11,518
Very much like you.

494
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:34,839
Laura, are you all right?

495
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:47,644
Ahh!

496
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:54,810
Move!

497
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:04,737
Hold on!

498
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:12,374
Fuck! Come on!

499
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:14,997
Come on!

500
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:23,172
Shit.

501
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:17,484
Fall in! Let's go!

502
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:25,613
Oh, watch out!

503
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:26,944
Ah!

504
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:10,787
Sit back.

505
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:21,541
Bring me the tracker.

506
00:42:29,006 --> 00:42:30,053
You.

507
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:33,306
Who the hell are you?

508
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,644
Hey! I asked you a question.
Who are you?

509
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:40,480
You know who she is, Logan.

510
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,357
No, I don't.

511
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,738
Does she remind you of anybody?

512
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:18,564
I read about you
when I was a kid.

513
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:22,101
I believe you're thinking
of someone else.

514
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:23,185
Hmm.

515
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:34,697
Now, if I'm not mistaken, you
used to work for my team.

516
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:37,916
You were helping round up
all those old mutes.

517
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:40,119
What changed?

518
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:42,545
You got religion?

519
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:48,260
I'm gonna need you to do

520
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:50,095
one more thing
for the good guys...

521
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:55,392
and track one more
special mute for me.

522
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:00,772
I'm not helping you.

523
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:02,933
Of course, you'd say that.

524
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,479
But I got a theory that
people don't really change.

525
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,408
Beware of the light.

526
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:15,196
Caliban, I bet that's what
your mama told you

527
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:16,906
every day when you was a kid.

528
00:44:23,162 --> 00:44:24,459
Beware of the light.

529
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,088
Now, let's not bring out
the worst in each other.

530
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:34,765
The girl is not worth it,
trust me.

531
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:37,260
She's not a natural fuck-up
like you.

532
00:44:37,426 --> 00:44:40,100
She's a business mistake,
a R&D gone bad.

533
00:44:40,262 --> 00:44:41,434
There's liability.

534
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:43,231
They can't have things
with patents

535
00:44:43,307 --> 00:44:45,105
running around,
hurting people, can they?

536
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:48,020
We need to get her off the board

537
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:49,776
before she hurts anybody else.

538
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:52,532
Someone you care about, maybe.

539
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:01,458
So, get to sniffin'.

540
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:07,956
<i>My name is Gabriela Lopez.</i>

541
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,632
<i>1 am a nurse.</i>

542
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,418
<i>And for 10 years, I worked for</i>

543
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:13,970
<i>Transigen Research
in Mexico City.</i>

544
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:17,846
<i>Transigen is owned
by an American company.</i>

545
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,689
<i>What I am about to show you
is illegal...</i>

547
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:36,068
<i>They told us we were part
of a pharmaceutical study.</i>

548
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,244
<i>But, of Course, that was a lie.</i>

549
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:41,657
<i>These children
were born in Transigen.</i>

550
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:44,201
<i>They were born here...</i>

551
00:45:44,368 --> 00:45:46,746
<i>and have never left.</i>

552
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:49,506
<i>They have never seen

<i>rain or snow...</i>

554
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:54,886

00:45:58,215 --> 00:45:59,683
<i>no names...</i>

557
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:02,182
<i>Besides the ones
we have given them.</i>

558
00:46:05,222 --> 00:46:09,193
<i>They</i> were <i>raised in the
bellies of Mexican girls.</i>

559
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:11,228
<i>Girls no one can find anymore.</i>

560
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:15,191
<i>Their</i> fathers are

<i>special seeds in homes.</i>

562
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:32,920
- Birthday? No birth.
- Maria.

<i>Comprende?</i>

569
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:45,804
<i>Si, senor.</i>

570
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:48,182
<i>They thought we were too poor</i>

571
00:46:48,265 --> 00:46:49,482
<i>and stupid to understand.</i>

572
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:52,065
We're poor, yes...

573
00:46:52,227 --> 00:46:53,274
<i>but we are not stupid.</i>

574
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:54,567
Use your powers.

575
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,163
<i>This is business.</i>

576
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:05,791
<i>They are making soldiers.</i>

577
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:07,409
<i>Killers.</i>

578
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:15,460
These are babies of mutantes...

00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:24,259
North Dakota.

580
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:25,427
Mmm.

581
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:27,770
You took that woman's money.

582
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:30,307
You said you would take
the child there.

583
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:37,239
What is she?

584
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:40,280
She's your daughter, Logan.

585
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:44,162
Alkali has your genetic code.

586
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:45,493
Not just mine.

587
00:47:45,614 --> 00:47:46,614
Logan...

588
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:47,759
I don't want to talk about it.

589
00:47:47,783 --> 00:47:48,968
I don't wanna hear
about it anymore.

590
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:50,414
Logan...
Just stop.

591
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:52,249
I have to pee.

592
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:06,468
Last ride.

593
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:12,023
You're welcome.

594
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:19,885
Slop it.
For God's sake,

595
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,283
I can do this myself!

596
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:22,585
Yeah, well, you're not doing it.

597
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:23,735
Just get on with it.

598
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:25,366
Not with you standing there.

599
00:48:25,529 --> 00:48:27,122

Hi, there!

603
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:05,837
You know you gotta pay
for that, right?

604
00:49:07,863 --> 00:49:10,412
Hey! Where's your
mommy and daddy, huh?

605
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:14,828
Come on.

606
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:16,087
That's enough. These, too.

607
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:19,420
Shit!

608
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:20,716
Not okay!

609
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:25,051
Sorry.

610
00:49:26,131 --> 00:49:27,804

611
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:29,509
Uh...

612
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:36,232
Come on. Get in the car.

<i>They could not be controlled.</i>

617
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:19,105
<i>The company made their bodies

618
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:21,937
<i>Tried to teach them to kill.</i>

619
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:24,322
<i>But they did not want to fight.</i>

620
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:29,907
<i>A soldier who will not fight
is useless.</i>

621
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:33,956
<i>Inside this building...</i>

622
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,435

623
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:39,121
<i>Something they think
is better than the children.</i>

624
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:42,127
<i>Something they say
is without a smut.</i>

625
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:43,809
<i>Would you like to hear
my fun' fab report, Dr. Rice?</i>

626
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,506
<i>You can't get good sushi here.</i>

00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:47,800
<i>It's the Mexican equivalent

628
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:51,731
<i>They must have been successful.</i>

629
00:50:52,509 --> 00:50:54,978
<i>About</i> a <i>week ago, they told
us to shut our program down.</i>

630
00:50:57,847 --> 00:51:00,316
<i>They started putting
the children to sleep.</i>

631
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:06,657

<i>A place for mutants.</i>

634
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:12,661

636
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:31,305
<i>It means that I am dead.</i>

637
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:35,636
<i>I am no! Sure if
any other children survived.</i>

638
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:38,146
<i>We were separated.</i>

639
00:51:38,305 --> 00:51:40,353
<i>There is no more money.</i>

640
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:42,188
<i>That was a lie.</i>

<i>She's not my child.</i>

642

<i>Please. I beg you...</i>

646
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:01,878
<i>take her to safety.</i>

647
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:51,136
Is this where we're hiding out?

648
00:52:51,795 --> 00:52:52,915
We're not hiding out.

649
00:52:53,046 --> 00:52:55,094
We're gonna get
a couple of hours' sleep...

650
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:56,849
clean up, get some new clothes,

651
00:52:56,925 --> 00:52:59,098
get a new ride

Let's go.

661
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:54,774
We need clothes.

662
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:08,712
Going up.

663
00:54:10,832 --> 00:54:12,834
No, no, stop. Not a toy.

664
00:54:13,835 --> 00:54:15,132

667
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:19,386
Going up.

668
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:21,677
Come here. Stand there.
Just stand there.

669
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:24,767
Logan, it's yours.

670
00:54:24,846 --> 00:54:25,893
What?

671
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:27,054
I'm not gonna wear it now.

672
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,820

This is a very
famous picture, Laura.

676
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:47,543
It's almost 100 years old.

<i>Abide with me</i>

679
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,329
I first saw this picture

680
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:25,907
at the Essoldo Cinema
in my hometown...

681
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:28,247

00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:47,262
Shit.

00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:30,223
<i>I've heard

<i>Prove it.</i>

688
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,160
You read these
in your spare time?

689
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,868
Oh, yeah, Charles, we got
ourselves an <i>X-Men</i> fan.

690
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:50,541
You do know
they're all bullshit, right?

691
00:56:50,617 --> 00:56:53,587
Maybe a quarter of it
happened, and not like this.

692
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:55,831
In the real world, people die.

693
00:56:55,997 --> 00:56:57,840
And no self-promoting asshole

694
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:59,418

696
00:57:01,711 --> 00:57:03,147
Her nurse has been feeding
her some grade-A bullshit.

697
00:57:03,171 --> 00:57:04,548
I don't think
Laura needs reminding

698
00:57:04,631 --> 00:57:06,053
of life's impermanence.

699
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:09,894
Didn't you say something about
finding us a new ride?

700
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,018
Two more pills in one hour.

701
00:57:13,932 --> 00:57:15,058
Give 'em to him.

702
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:16,935
<i>Why, Shane?</i>

703
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:20,275
<i>A man has to be

704
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:23,320
<i>Can't break the mold.</i>

705
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:25,827
<i>I tried it
and it didn't work for me.</i>

706
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:28,329
<i>Joey, there's no living
with</i> a <i>killing.</i>

707
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:30,411
<i>There's no going back from one.</i>

708
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:32,826
<i>Right or wrong, it's a brand.</i>

709
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:34,502
<i>A brand sticks.</i>

710
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:37,000
<i>Now you run on home
to your mother,</i>

711
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,798
<i>and tell her
everything's all right.</i>

712
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:43,053
<i>And there aren't any more

713
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:04,948
Who are you guys?

714
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:06,735
More cops? 'Cause I told

715
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:08,320
the other guys
everything that I...

716
00:58:18,246 --> 00:58:20,590
Get up!
In your cage, tracker.

717
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:22,421
You did your job.

718
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:45,482
Fellas.

719
00:58:58,745 --> 00:59:00,292
Shit.

720
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:03,174
Knock yourselves out.

721
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:06,645
I'll tell you what.
Eight grand...

722
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:08,922
I'll have her freshly painted
for you, new tires...

723
00:59:09,088 --> 00:59:10,728
mounted, balanced,
and complete paperwork.

724
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,057
I'll give you 10 as-is,

725
00:59:12,133 --> 00:59:13,601
if you can forget the paperwork.

726
00:59:15,428 --> 00:59:17,647
Well, you still need new
tires, man, they're bald.

727
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:18,931
How long will that take?

728
00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:20,099
An hour.

729
00:59:52,715 --> 00:59:53,716
Jesus.

730
01:00:06,896 --> 01:00:09,240
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

731
01:00:19,534 --> 01:00:21,582
Sir, are the keys in...
Sir!

732
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:23,746
You have
the keys in it? Sir!

733
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:29,836
Shit!

734
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:55,028
Charles. Charles!

735
01:00:56,154 --> 01:00:57,497
Argh!

736
01:01:27,977 --> 01:01:29,017
Going up.

737
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:48,079
Oh, shit!

738
01:03:48,242 --> 01:03:49,459
You all right?

739
01:03:51,537 --> 01:03:52,663
We gotta get outta here.

740
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:57,585
I'm so sorry.

741
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:00,630
I'm so sorry.

742
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,008
<i>Emergency
personnel are still on scene</i>

743
01:04:28,032 --> 01:04:30,660
<i>at Harrah's Casino Hate!
In Oklahoma City...</i>

744
01:04:30,826 --> 01:04:32,749
<i>where at least 400 guests
were stricken</i>

745
01:04:32,828 --> 01:04:34,671
<i>with temporary paralysis
yesterday.</i>

746
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:36,624
<i>Many are noting a similarity</i>

747
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:38,507
<i>to the Westchester incident
over a year ago...</i>

748
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:40,257
<i>that left over 600 injured...</i>

749
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:41,688
<i>and took me lives
of seven mutants,</i>

750
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:43,180
<i>including several
of the X-Men.</i>

751
01:04:43,923 --> 01:04:45,049
Knock it off.

752
01:04:47,927 --> 01:04:49,429
I said, knock ii off!

753
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:51,188
She's a child, Logan.

754
01:04:53,682 --> 01:04:55,184
And, point of fact,
she's your...

755
01:04:55,351 --> 01:04:57,151
How long has it been
since you took your meds?

756
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:00,374
Tell me, how long has it been?

757
01:05:00,398 --> 01:05:01,741
I don't know!

758
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,743
Two days.

759
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:05,448
You saw what happened yesterday.

760
01:05:05,528 --> 01:05:06,630
If that shit
had gone on any longer,

761
01:05:06,654 --> 01:05:07,746
everyone in that casino...

762
01:05:07,822 --> 01:05:10,075
I did what I had to do
to save Laura.

763
01:05:10,241 --> 01:05:11,538
You didn't do anything.

764
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:14,123
You just freaked out
and had a fucking seizure!

765
01:05:14,787 --> 01:05:18,166
I guess you prefer me
pharmaceutically castrated,

766
01:05:18,249 --> 01:05:20,126
rambling on like a lunatic.

767
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:21,794
So much easier for you.

768
01:05:21,961 --> 01:05:23,053
Easier? Jesus!

769
01:05:23,212 --> 01:05:25,431
There is nothing easy
about you, Charles, nothing!

770
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:28,058
Yes, yes, please be
like the rest of the world...

771
01:05:28,217 --> 01:05:30,720
blaming someone else
for your boring shit.

772
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:32,646
I know, Pop, I'm such
a giant disappointment.

773
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:36,734
You honestly derive
no sense of purpose...

774
01:05:36,892 --> 01:05:37,939
from what we're doing?

775
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:39,649
Okay, what are we doing?
Hmm?

776
01:05:40,396 --> 01:05:43,946
There is a young mutant
sitting in our car.

777
01:05:44,108 --> 01:05:45,155
Yeah, I see that.

778
01:05:45,317 --> 01:05:47,536
And where we're taking her,
there are others.

779
01:05:47,695 --> 01:05:49,493
Does that mean nothing to you?

780
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:51,498
Yeah, means nothing to me.

781
01:05:51,866 --> 01:05:53,243
Especially since
Nurse Gabriela...

782
01:05:53,409 --> 01:05:55,832
made all that Eden shit up
with fucking comic books.

783
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:57,668
What are you talking about?

784
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:58,950
Give those to him, will you?

785
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:00,225
Take out two pills
and give them to him.

786
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:01,751
Logan! Logan!
Give 'em to him.

787
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:03,085
Now!

788
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:09,054
I wanna see it.

789
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:35,038
Dr. Rice.
It's under control...

790
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:04,655
Motherfucking auto-trucks.

791
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:06,114
Language, Logan.

792
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:08,401
And you're screaming
at a machine.

793
01:07:08,567 --> 01:07:10,319
Oh, what? She can gut a man
with her feet,

794
01:07:10,402 --> 01:07:11,922
she can't hear
a few naughty words, huh?

795
01:07:11,946 --> 01:07:14,540
She can learn to be better.

796
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:16,166
You mean, better than me'?

797
01:07:16,325 --> 01:07:18,043
Actually, yes.

798
01:07:19,787 --> 01:07:21,960
And, by the way,
Laura's foot claws...

799
01:07:22,122 --> 01:07:24,716
are the obvious result
of her gender, you know.

800
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:26,092
Is that a fact?

801
01:07:26,252 --> 01:07:28,175
In a pride of lions,
the female...

802
01:07:28,337 --> 01:07:30,806
is both hunter and caregiver.

803
01:07:30,965 --> 01:07:32,057
Good to know.

804
01:07:32,424 --> 01:07:34,927
She uses her front claws
for hunting...

805
01:07:35,094 --> 01:07:36,437
and the back claws defensively.

806
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:37,513
Oh, yeah?

807
01:07:37,596 --> 01:07:39,223
Thus, ensuring their survival.

808
01:07:45,521 --> 01:07:46,647
Hey, hey!

809
01:08:15,593 --> 01:08:17,140
We should help them.

810
01:08:18,554 --> 01:08:20,852
No, we have to keep going.
Someone will come along.

811
01:08:21,015 --> 01:08:22,688
Someone has come along.

812
01:08:34,403 --> 01:08:36,747
Alert. Alert.

813
01:08:39,241 --> 01:08:40,788
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

814
01:09:19,323 --> 01:09:21,371
Hey, uh, you need a hand?

815
01:09:22,743 --> 01:09:24,666
Ready? Go!

816
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:28,586
Ah. Good, got it.

817
01:09:30,376 --> 01:09:32,424
Come on, let's get home. Laura!

818
01:09:32,503 --> 01:09:34,005
Thank you so much for your help.

819
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:35,556
I'm Kathryn.
James.

820
01:09:35,714 --> 01:09:36,715
This is my son, Nate.

821
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:38,099
Hi.
Hey.

822
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:39,680
That's your daughter?

823
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:42,016
Yeah, that's Laura,
and that's my dad...

824
01:09:42,763 --> 01:09:43,935
Chuck.

825
01:09:44,056 --> 01:09:45,056
Come on, Laura, let's go.

826
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:47,022
Well, can we show
our appreciation

827
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:48,745
and treat the three of you
to a decent meal?

828
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:50,066
We don't live far from here.

829
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:52,277
Uh, no, thanks.
That would be lovely!

830
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,953
My name is Dr. Rice.

831
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:03,959
But you can call me Zander
if you like.

832
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:06,624
My colleague tells me

833
01:10:06,704 --> 01:10:09,082
you've been somewhat resistant.

834
01:10:09,415 --> 01:10:11,213
He believes you've been

835
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:13,043
dispensing
delayed information...

836
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:15,304
to allow your friends
to stay one step ahead.

837
01:10:18,757 --> 01:10:19,943
I'm offering you the possibility

838
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:21,264
of redemption, Caliban.

839
01:10:22,386 --> 01:10:24,229
To protect the world,
and in the process,

840
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:25,556
save your friends.

841
01:10:25,723 --> 01:10:28,977
The girl is a rather
small price to pay for that.

842
01:10:29,143 --> 01:10:30,941
Unlike you, she's impure.

843
01:10:31,103 --> 01:10:32,821
She wasn't made by nature.

844
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,152
She's a mistake of my own.

845
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:35,399
I did what I could

846
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:36,734
and they burned me and beat me.

847
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,618
Your colleagues are savages.

848
01:10:39,153 --> 01:10:40,496
I agree.

849
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:42,497
The Reavers
were very ineffective.

850
01:10:42,656 --> 01:10:45,580
But I'm bringing
new tools to bear.

851
01:10:45,743 --> 01:10:46,744
But I still need someone

852
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:47,971
to point us
in the right direction.

853
01:10:47,995 --> 01:10:49,247
No, I can't help you.

854
01:10:49,413 --> 01:10:51,086
Breathe, breathe.

855
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:53,250
Now, what does he have?
The old man.

856
01:10:53,417 --> 01:10:55,169
Alzheimer's? ALS?

857
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,922
A degenerative brain disease

858
01:10:58,005 --> 01:11:00,428
in the world's most
dangerous brain?

859
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:02,350
What a combo.

860
01:11:05,179 --> 01:11:07,307
<i>Be nice.
Now, you know we got company.</i>

861
01:11:07,473 --> 01:11:08,520
That's wonderful.

862
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:09,962
<i>Everybody, have a seat.</i>

863
01:11:10,017 --> 01:11:11,314
Nate, sit up.

864
01:11:11,477 --> 01:11:13,163
<i>James, why don't you sit
at the end of the table?</i>

865
01:11:13,187 --> 01:11:15,189
<i>You wanna say grace?
Say grace, baby.</i>

866
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:18,780
Uh, thank you, God,
for this food...

867
01:11:19,443 --> 01:11:21,992
and for our new friends,
the Howletts.

868
01:11:22,154 --> 01:11:23,451
Mmm. They came
to our aid.

869
01:11:23,614 --> 01:11:24,991
Amen.
Amen.

870
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:26,676
Here we go.
Here you go, Charles.

871
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,543
Thank you, sir.

872
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:44,384
Mmm-hmm.

873
01:11:46,887 --> 01:11:48,480
Oh, there's plenty more
if she wants.

874
01:11:48,639 --> 01:11:50,232
She's fine. Thank you.

875
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,470
This is delicious.

876
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:52,952
- Oh, thank you.
- It's so good.

877
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:54,353
Where are you all headed?

878
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,897
Uh... Oregon.
South Dakota.

879
01:11:57,731 --> 01:11:58,732
Um...

880
01:11:58,857 --> 01:12:01,235
Well, Oregon
and then South Dakota.

881
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:02,744
Vacation?

882
01:12:02,903 --> 01:12:03,904
Uh... Yes.

883
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:06,073
Uh, long overdue.

884
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,492
We're city folk.

885
01:12:07,658 --> 01:12:11,083
Always wanted to take a
road trip, see the country.

886
01:12:12,371 --> 01:12:13,748
Um... And meet
the people in it.

887
01:12:13,914 --> 01:12:15,166
That sounds lovely.

888
01:12:15,332 --> 01:12:16,452
Been trying to get Will here

889
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:18,044
to take a vacation
for years now.

890
01:12:18,252 --> 01:12:19,854
Oh. If we go traipsing
all over the country,

891
01:12:19,878 --> 01:12:21,022
who's gonna take care
of this place?

892
01:12:21,046 --> 01:12:22,923
Exactly.
I say, let it go.

893
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:24,091
And live off what?

894
01:12:24,258 --> 01:12:26,010
The Lord will provide.

895
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:28,029
I'm still waiting for
the Lord to provide me

896
01:12:28,053 --> 01:12:29,270
with a new thresher.

897
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:31,389
All the same,
I'd love to travel someday.

898
01:12:31,598 --> 01:12:33,771
And I bet you will.

899
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:35,411
I could drop out of school.

900
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:36,496
Okay, let's not go that far.

901
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,612
I mean, I'll do it.

902
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:38,971
No. No.
NATE; Why not?

903
01:12:39,106 --> 01:12:40,449
You wanna travel,
I wanna travel.

904
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:41,525
Son. Son.

905
01:12:41,942 --> 01:12:43,086
That sounds good to you, right?

906
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:44,407
This is the perfect plan.

907
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:45,970
Why would you want
to do that, Nate?

908
01:12:46,697 --> 01:12:49,120
Careful, you're speaking to
a man who ran a school...

909
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:52,123
for a lot of years.
Right, Charles?

910
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:54,621
Yes, it was a.-.

911
01:12:55,247 --> 01:12:58,421
It was a special needs
school. Um...

912
01:12:59,585 --> 01:13:01,132
Uh-huh.
That's a good description.

913
01:13:01,879 --> 01:13:03,301
He was there, too.

914
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:04,464
Oh, yeah, no. Um...

915
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:05,750
I got kicked out a few times.

916
01:13:06,925 --> 01:13:08,552
I wish I could say
you were a good pupil,

917
01:13:08,635 --> 01:13:09,932
but the words would choke me.

918
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:34,578
Ma'am, I can't thank you
enough for this.

919
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:36,004
Uh, it was great.

920
01:13:36,163 --> 01:13:37,961
But we have along drive
ahead of us, so...

921
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:39,392
But you need to rest,
don't you'?

922
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:41,056
Yeah, we'll find
a motel somewhere.

923
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:42,145
The nearest one
is two hours from here

924
01:13:42,169 --> 01:13:43,289
and it's not even that nice.

925
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:45,513
We have a perfectly fine
room upstairs

926
01:13:45,631 --> 01:13:46,774
for your father
and your daughter and

927
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:48,484
you can sleep in the living
room on the convertible.

928
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:49,777
Kathryn, it's very,
very nice of you,

929
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:51,018
but we really should go.

930
01:13:51,136 --> 01:13:53,309
We can leave
early in the morning.

931
01:13:53,472 --> 01:13:56,772
Break of dawn, as it were.

932
01:13:59,478 --> 01:14:01,446
Okay, why don't we wash up, Pop?

933
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:02,606
Okay.

934
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:03,690
Sit.

935
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:09,655
Um, sweetie,
you want some dessert?

936
01:14:09,821 --> 01:14:11,118
Two days on the road,

937
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:13,121
only one meal,
and hardly any sleep.

938
01:14:13,283 --> 01:14:15,331
She's 11, I'm fucking 90.

939
01:14:15,494 --> 01:14:17,337
Well, that's 101 reasons
to keep moving.

940
01:14:17,496 --> 01:14:19,498
I'm not a box
of avocados, Logan.

941
01:14:19,665 --> 01:14:21,434
And then what? We
stay the night, then what?

942
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:24,962
Then we take her to
her friends in Eden.

943
01:14:27,214 --> 01:14:29,558
And then we buy the Sunseeker.

944
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:32,477
Take the pills.

945
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:37,891
Oh, shit!

946
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:41,061
What's going on?
Nate!

947
01:14:41,228 --> 01:14:43,230
Go fill up the tub
before we lose pressure.

948
01:14:43,397 --> 01:14:44,740
Honey, check the sink.

949
01:14:44,898 --> 01:14:46,320
They shut it off again.

950
01:14:46,984 --> 01:14:48,628
They are just not going to
let this thing go.

951
01:14:48,652 --> 01:14:50,132
Well, you might as well
handle it now.

952
01:14:50,237 --> 01:14:52,131
It can wait till the morning.
We just had rain last night.

953
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:53,498
We got three houseguests

954
01:14:53,573 --> 01:14:54,613
and a sink full of dishes.

955
01:14:54,741 --> 01:14:56,368
All right, all right.

956
01:14:57,244 --> 01:14:58,666
The pump station
that supplies us

957
01:14:58,745 --> 01:14:59,985
is a mile and a half from here.

958
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:01,878
Sometimes it gets itself
shut off.

959
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,041
- By assholes.
- Hey!

960
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:04,209
No.

961
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:06,507
My son is happy to go with you.

962
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,422
No, no, no, that's fine.

963
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:10,431
The men that do this,
sometimes they can be...

964
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:12,342
I can go.
No, you got homework.

965
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:14,011
All right, I'll go.

966
01:15:14,177 --> 01:15:15,895
Just, uh,
let me get my dad settled.

967
01:15:19,725 --> 01:15:20,726
All right.

968
01:15:22,394 --> 01:15:24,772
I'm just saying, I don't
care what the lawyer says.

969
01:15:27,107 --> 01:15:28,227
But it's dangerous.

970
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,402
I'm not gonna hurt our chances.

971
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:45,630
Want TV? There's TV here.

972
01:15:45,792 --> 01:15:46,793
I'm fine.

973
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:48,044
Okay. Get some rest.

974
01:15:48,128 --> 01:15:50,130
You know, Logan...

975
01:15:50,714 --> 01:15:52,887
this is what life looks like.

976
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,928
A home,
people who love each other.

977
01:15:56,094 --> 01:15:57,266
Safe place.

978
01:15:57,429 --> 01:15:59,978
You should
take a moment and feel it.

979
01:16:02,809 --> 01:16:04,777
Yeah. It's great.

980
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:06,483
Logan. Logan!

981
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,568
You still have time.

982
01:16:13,111 --> 01:16:17,241
Charles, the world is not
the same as it was.

983
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:22,333
We're taking a risk hanging
around here, you know that.

984
01:16:22,913 --> 01:16:25,587
And where we're going, Eden...

985
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:27,835
it doesn't exist.

986
01:16:28,752 --> 01:16:30,925
Her nurse got it
from a comic book.

987
01:16:32,798 --> 01:16:35,176
You understand?
It's not real.

988
01:16:35,842 --> 01:16:37,936
It is for Laura.

989
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:44,188
It is for Laura.

990
01:16:47,145 --> 01:16:48,488
Get some rest.

991
01:16:51,983 --> 01:16:53,951
Canewood Beverage bought up
everything out here,

992
01:16:54,027 --> 01:16:55,199
except for us.

993
01:16:55,362 --> 01:16:57,990
When we wouldn't sell,
they tried eminent domain...

994
01:16:58,156 --> 01:16:59,783
then screwing with our water.

995
01:17:00,784 --> 01:17:03,287
Couple of months ago,
somebody poisoned our dogs.

996
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:06,544
So, out on the highway
today, those trucks...

997
01:17:07,499 --> 01:17:09,217
Who knows. Maybe.

998
01:17:10,377 --> 01:17:12,379
Hey, look at 'em.

999
01:17:12,963 --> 01:17:14,806
Look like dinosaurs
with their 20-ton bodies

1000
01:17:14,881 --> 01:17:16,224
and tiny little brains...

1001
01:17:16,383 --> 01:17:18,556
shucking their cloned-up
super corn.

1002
01:17:18,718 --> 01:17:20,038
You know it tastes
like shit, too.

1003
01:17:20,137 --> 01:17:21,389
Why do people eat it?

1004
01:17:21,555 --> 01:17:23,899
They don't. They drink it.
Corn syrup.

1005
01:17:24,057 --> 01:17:25,857
It's in those drinks
that everyone's having...

1006
01:17:25,976 --> 01:17:29,571
to stay awake, cheer up,
feel strong, sexy, whatever.

1007
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:32,573
Used to be a time when a bad
day was just a bad day.

1008
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:34,154
Mine still are.

1009
01:17:56,089 --> 01:17:58,842
Those are for breakaway roping.

1010
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:01,678
Those are for barrel racing...

1011
01:18:01,928 --> 01:18:03,930
and right here
is for pole bending.

1012
01:18:04,097 --> 01:18:05,940
They're all second, third place.

1013
01:18:06,099 --> 01:18:09,729
I'm not too good at it,
but my dad makes me.

1014
01:18:18,445 --> 01:18:20,413
Do you want to listen?

1015
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:31,799
Do you like it?

1016
01:18:35,754 --> 01:18:38,098
Um, here, you can
take it for tonight...

1017
01:18:38,256 --> 01:18:41,305
and I'll get it back
from you in the morning.

1018
01:18:54,147 --> 01:18:56,241
Looks like we're gonna
be here a while.

1019
01:19:29,683 --> 01:19:30,980
Should hold it.

1020
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:32,268
Yeah.

1021
01:19:32,519 --> 01:19:34,112
Till next time.

1022
01:19:34,688 --> 01:19:35,814
Thanks.

1023
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:40,118
Hey, so, uh, how
long has your girl

1024
01:19:40,193 --> 01:19:41,820
been like that?
Huh?

1025
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:43,367
Mute.

1026
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:47,497
Uh, since the beginning.

1027
01:19:48,034 --> 01:19:49,035
Mmm.

1028
01:19:49,619 --> 01:19:51,713
Well, in a lot of ways,
I envy you.

1029
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:53,961
They get to be Nate's age,

1030
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,040
with the nonsense that comes
out of their mouths...

1031
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,304
Makes you wonder the
whole point of it all.

1032
01:20:01,673 --> 01:20:03,220
Shit.

1033
01:20:07,387 --> 01:20:08,388
Don't worry.

1034
01:20:08,555 --> 01:20:10,023
We won't need it.

1035
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:11,474
Stay here.

1036
01:20:18,898 --> 01:20:20,195
Evening, Mr. Munson.

1037
01:20:20,734 --> 01:20:21,814
What brings y'all this way?

1038
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:24,324
Why don't you ask your boys?

1039
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:25,659
Mr. Munson,

1040
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:27,466
you understand you're
trespassing right now, right?

1041
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:29,051
I have an easement with
the previous owner

1042
01:20:29,075 --> 01:20:30,076
of your property.

1043
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,503
Huh. Bullshit.

1044
01:20:31,661 --> 01:20:33,663
"Previous" being
the operative word.

1045
01:20:34,873 --> 01:20:36,090
Who's this?

1046
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:38,418
Just a guy telling you

1047
01:20:38,543 --> 01:20:39,920
to get back in your nice truck.

1048
01:20:40,086 --> 01:20:42,760
Go play Okie dickhead
somewhere else.

1049
01:20:47,218 --> 01:20:48,265
Hey, Carl...

1050
01:20:49,012 --> 01:20:52,186
it looks like Mr. Munson
hired some muscle.

1051
01:20:52,349 --> 01:20:53,692
Looks that way.

1052
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:55,272
He's a friend of mine.

1053
01:20:55,435 --> 01:20:57,108
A friend with a big mouth.

1054
01:20:57,437 --> 01:20:58,689
I hear that a lot.

1055
01:20:58,855 --> 01:21:00,495
Then you probably
hear this, too.

1056
01:21:03,068 --> 01:21:04,615
More than I'd like.

1057
01:21:04,778 --> 01:21:05,950
Then you know the drill.

1058
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:08,956
I'mma count to three...

1059
01:21:09,115 --> 01:21:10,515
and you're gonna
start walking away.

1060
01:21:10,617 --> 01:21:11,677
I got rights to this water.

1061
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:12,873
One.
I have a lawyer now.

1062
01:21:12,952 --> 01:21:13,953
Two.

1063
01:21:15,622 --> 01:21:17,044
Three.
Ah. Ah.

1064
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:18,542
You all right, boss?

1065
01:21:21,294 --> 01:21:23,105
You know the drill. JACKSON:
Pick up my goddamn hat.

1066
01:21:23,129 --> 01:21:24,130
Get the hell out of here.

1067
01:21:24,297 --> 01:21:26,140
You okay, boss?
Fuck off.

1068
01:21:26,216 --> 01:21:27,217
Go!

1069
01:21:44,317 --> 01:21:45,739
You've had training.

1070
01:21:46,236 --> 01:21:47,283
Some.

1071
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:09,134
Hey, don't wake her yet.

1072
01:22:09,509 --> 01:22:11,932
Let her sleep another hour.

1073
01:22:16,266 --> 01:22:18,018
You know, Logan...

1074
01:22:19,686 --> 01:22:22,690
this was, without a doubt...

1075
01:22:23,815 --> 01:22:28,821
the most perfect night
I've had in a very long time.

1076
01:22:36,828 --> 01:22:38,876
But I don't deserve it.

1077
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:42,042
Do I?

1078
01:22:45,462 --> 01:22:47,806
I did something.

1079
01:22:50,467 --> 01:22:52,890
Something unspeakable.

1080
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:02,403
I've remembered
what happened in Westchester.

1081
01:23:07,025 --> 01:23:10,370
This is not the first time
I've hurt people.

1082
01:23:12,363 --> 01:23:15,663
Until today, I didn't know.

1083
01:23:16,576 --> 01:23:18,578
You wouldn't tell me.

1084
01:23:20,747 --> 01:23:26,754
So we just kept on
running away from it.

1085
01:23:31,174 --> 01:23:34,895
I think I finally
understand you.

1086
01:23:38,264 --> 01:23:39,561
Logan...

1087
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:08,636
He's fantastic.

1088
01:24:08,795 --> 01:24:10,138
You said you only needed
the girl!

1089
01:24:10,296 --> 01:24:12,424
I told you I was forced
to bring a new tool to bear.

1090
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:13,807
Your friends had every chance.

1091
01:24:13,967 --> 01:24:15,139
And so did you.

1092
01:24:16,302 --> 01:24:17,394
Nate?

1093
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,483
Put her down.

1094
01:24:30,942 --> 01:24:31,989
Honey.

1095
01:24:32,485 --> 01:24:34,112
Stay down there, Will!

1096
01:24:36,447 --> 01:24:37,447
Stop!

1097
01:24:38,616 --> 01:24:39,856
Kathryn!

1098
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:41,637
Kathryn!

1099
01:24:41,661 --> 01:24:43,004
Kathryn!

1100
01:25:11,482 --> 01:25:12,529
Charles!

1101
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:14,782
Charles!

1102
01:25:28,124 --> 01:25:29,125
Hold this.

1103
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:31,465
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.

1104
01:25:34,047 --> 01:25:35,048
Here he comes.

1105
01:25:35,965 --> 01:25:37,137
I could pick him up,

1106
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:38,217
meet him halfway.

1107
01:25:38,384 --> 01:25:39,852
No, no, no.
Let them come to us.

1108
01:25:40,011 --> 01:25:42,139
We struggled
with the X-23s.

1109
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:43,532
We assumed,
because they were children...

1110
01:25:43,556 --> 01:25:44,992
we could raise them
without a conscience.

1111
01:25:45,016 --> 01:25:46,893
But you can't nurture rage.

1112
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:48,232
You must simply design it...

1113
01:25:48,394 --> 01:25:49,395
from scratch.

1114
01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:59,414
Who the fuck is that?

1115
01:26:04,327 --> 01:26:05,579
Will Munson!

1116
01:26:08,748 --> 01:26:10,170
Just hold on, Charles.

1117
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,923
Munson, God
damn it, come out here!

1118
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:18,257
Munson!

1119
01:26:20,009 --> 01:26:21,431
Come out here now!

1120
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:23,767
Come out here now, Munson.

1121
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:25,227
There's that asshole.

1122
01:26:27,225 --> 01:26:28,568
Hello, asshole.

1123
01:26:28,726 --> 01:26:31,605
Listen, I'm willing
to let bygones be bygones.

1124
01:26:31,938 --> 01:26:33,781
I don't know what
Munson's paying you...

1125
01:26:34,357 --> 01:26:36,951
but Canewood can start
you out at five G.

1126
01:26:37,068 --> 01:26:38,115
A week, that is.

1127
01:26:40,363 --> 01:26:42,365
You best stay
where you are, pal.

1128
01:26:42,532 --> 01:26:44,284
I'm the law out here.

1129
01:26:45,118 --> 01:26:46,870
No, no, no.

1130
01:26:48,246 --> 01:26:49,247
What in high...

1131
01:26:50,957 --> 01:26:52,880
What? Oh, shit!

1132
01:26:53,042 --> 01:26:54,043
Shoot him!

1133
01:26:56,045 --> 01:26:57,137
We need to intervene.

1134
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:59,549
Well, he only listens
to you, Doctor.

1135
01:27:02,468 --> 01:27:03,594
24!

1136
01:27:04,887 --> 01:27:05,888
Get back here!

1137
01:27:06,973 --> 01:27:08,145
Stop! Stop now!

1138
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:10,150
Hold this down,
right now, tight!

1139
01:27:14,564 --> 01:27:16,316
Our boat.
What?

1140
01:27:21,654 --> 01:27:23,907
The Sunseeker.

1141
01:27:33,583 --> 01:27:34,584
No.

1142
01:27:43,468 --> 01:27:44,469
Come!

1143
01:27:44,677 --> 01:27:45,803
24!

1144
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:48,101
Need some help out here!

1145
01:27:48,806 --> 01:27:50,617
I guess we're gonna have to
take care of this now.

1146
01:27:50,641 --> 01:27:52,161
- Pierce!
- Give me that.

1147
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:53,990
Get your lily-faced
ass out here!

1148
01:28:00,193 --> 01:28:01,365
Listen to me!

1149
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:03,087
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

1150
01:28:03,196 --> 01:28:05,119
All right, we gotta
go around that truck

1151
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:06,495
and flank them farmers.

1152
01:28:06,657 --> 01:28:07,954
Follow my lead.

1153
01:28:08,034 --> 01:28:09,957
Bring extra ammo,
take these clips.

1154
01:28:10,036 --> 01:28:11,083
Come!

1155
01:28:11,329 --> 01:28:12,546
Now!

1156
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:14,715
Pick her up.

1157
01:28:25,551 --> 01:28:26,723
Beware the light.

1158
01:28:49,909 --> 01:28:51,331
What the hell are you?

1159
01:31:18,307 --> 01:31:19,559
Sit down.

1160
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:40,166
Hold still.

1161
01:31:40,579 --> 01:31:41,922
Hold still.

1162
01:32:03,936 --> 01:32:05,056
Get him on the truck.

1163
01:32:05,104 --> 01:32:06,105
MAN 23 Yeah.

1164
01:32:07,773 --> 01:32:09,025
Go.

1165
01:32:14,739 --> 01:32:16,537
It's all right, it's all right.

1166
01:32:16,699 --> 01:32:19,623
It's all right.
You did fine, 24.

1167
01:32:19,785 --> 01:32:21,753
You're healing.
Just breathe.

1168
01:32:23,122 --> 01:32:25,625
You're a newborn,
by any measure.

1169
01:32:25,791 --> 01:32:27,088
Just breathe.

1170
01:32:27,418 --> 01:32:28,510
Your body has work to do.

1171
01:32:28,669 --> 01:32:31,263
Hemostasis, angiogenesis,
epithelialization...

1172
01:32:31,422 --> 01:32:32,765
stromal cell proliferation.

1173
01:32:34,633 --> 01:32:36,431
This will help you heal.

1174
01:32:37,303 --> 01:32:38,805
Make you stronger.

1175
01:33:33,901 --> 01:33:35,073
Well...

1176
01:33:41,033 --> 01:33:42,876
It's got water, and...

1177
01:34:05,891 --> 01:34:07,234
It's got water.

1178
01:34:25,077 --> 01:34:26,420
Fuck this. Fuck this.

1179
01:34:39,842 --> 01:34:41,014
God!

1180
01:34:47,308 --> 01:34:49,106
Fuck! Fuck!

1181
01:34:49,226 --> 01:34:50,273
Fuck!

1182
01:34:50,936 --> 01:34:51,937
Shit!

1183
01:35:04,617 --> 01:35:05,789
Fuck! Fuck!

1184
01:35:07,578 --> 01:35:09,125
Fuck!

1185
01:35:09,288 --> 01:35:10,915
Motherfucking...

1186
01:35:15,252 --> 01:35:16,299
Shit!

1187
01:35:17,463 --> 01:35:19,511
Fuck! Fuck!

1188
01:35:47,368 --> 01:35:48,961
Welcome back.

1189
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,514
I was starting to think
I was gonna have to tell...

1190
01:35:51,538 --> 01:35:53,418
that nice little girl
out in the waiting room...

1191
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:55,042
her daddy's gone.

1192
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:02,390
I'd always hoped...

1193
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:07,646
that I'd get the chance
to meet someone like you.

1194
01:36:08,013 --> 01:36:09,686
There's so few of you left.

1195
01:36:12,184 --> 01:36:14,357
Nice to meet you, too, Doc.

1196
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,830
But I really
got to get on my way.

1197
01:36:15,854 --> 01:36:17,071
No, no, don't do that.

1198
01:36:17,231 --> 01:36:19,700
What you need is rest,
and treatment.

1199
01:36:19,858 --> 01:36:21,378
You need to check yourself
in somewhere.

1200
01:36:21,402 --> 01:36:22,574
I'll be fine.

1201
01:36:22,695 --> 01:36:23,867
No, you're not!

1202
01:36:24,029 --> 01:36:27,033
I mean, I know
that you're different...

1203
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:28,468
but that doesn't change the fact

1204
01:36:28,492 --> 01:36:30,494
that something inside you
is poisoning you.

1205
01:36:30,661 --> 01:36:32,880
You got to check yourself
into a hospital.

1206
01:36:33,038 --> 01:36:34,711
Find out what it is!

1207
01:36:35,165 --> 01:36:36,382
I know what it is.

1208
01:36:37,251 --> 01:36:39,504
Please, mister, if you don't
want to go to a hospital,

1209
01:36:39,586 --> 01:36:40,587
maybe I can help you.

1210
01:36:40,754 --> 01:36:42,006
Maybe I can run some tests.

1211
01:36:42,172 --> 01:36:44,550
Look, Doc. You seem
like a nice guy, all right?

1212
01:36:44,717 --> 01:36:46,390
You wanna save a life,
save your own.

1213
01:36:46,552 --> 01:36:47,599
Forget we were here.

1214
01:36:47,761 --> 01:36:48,853
Let's go.

1215
01:37:00,024 --> 01:37:01,025
Hey!

1216
01:37:01,567 --> 01:37:02,568
Hey!

1217
01:37:23,088 --> 01:37:25,090
You can't just take shit,
you know.

1218
01:37:43,609 --> 01:37:45,828
I don't know
how you got me here...

1219
01:37:46,612 --> 01:37:47,784
but thank you.

1220
01:37:47,863 --> 01:37:48,864
<i>De nada.</i>

1221
01:37:49,073 --> 01:37:50,245
Yeah.

1222
01:37:52,117 --> 01:37:53,460
You can talk?

1223
01:37:55,579 --> 01:37:56,831
You can talk?

1224
01:37:57,664 --> 01:37:59,416
What the fuck?

1225
01:37:59,625 --> 01:38:00,751
Why in the fuck...

1226
01:38:00,918 --> 01:38:01,936
What's all this bullshit been

1227
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,928
for the last
2,000 fucking miles?

1228
01:38:06,924 --> 01:38:08,597
What? Shut up.

1229
01:38:08,759 --> 01:38:09,931
Shut the fuck up!

1230
01:38:10,010 --> 01:38:12,729
Jonah, Gideon,
Rebecca, Delilah, Rictor.

1231
01:38:12,805 --> 01:38:15,103
What? Who's that?

1232
01:38:15,265 --> 01:38:16,437
Who is that?

1233
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:21,360
Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca,
Delilah, and Rictor.

1234
01:38:21,855 --> 01:38:22,902
North Dakota.

1235
01:38:23,857 --> 01:38:25,154
What?

1236
01:38:25,275 --> 01:38:26,652
North Dakota, por favor.

1237
01:38:26,777 --> 01:38:27,949
Shit, okay. Look...

1238
01:38:28,028 --> 01:38:29,200
<i>No. Por favor.</i>

1239
01:38:30,823 --> 01:38:32,496
This place. Okay?

1240
01:38:32,658 --> 01:38:33,784
Your nurse,

1241
01:38:33,867 --> 01:38:36,165
she read too many stories,
you understand?

1242
01:38:36,328 --> 01:38:37,875
Too many stories!

1243
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:44,507
I've seen it!
I've seen it, okay?

1244
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:45,796
This all here.“

1245
01:38:45,963 --> 01:38:47,965
None of this...
No <i>existo,</i> okay?

1246
01:38:48,048 --> 01:38:49,049
You understand me?

1247
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:50,513
This Eden
does not exist. No!

1248
01:38:50,676 --> 01:38:51,973
<i>Si! Edam!</i>

1249
01:38:52,136 --> 01:38:53,979
It's a fantasy, kid.
See that?

1250
01:38:54,138 --> 01:38:55,156
Those are the names
of the people

1251
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:56,978
who just made this...

1252
01:38:57,057 --> 01:38:58,855
They made this whole thing up.

1253
01:38:59,351 --> 01:39:00,648
Okay? This whole...

1254
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:01,811
It happened once,

1255
01:39:01,854 --> 01:39:03,734
and they just turned it
into a big, fucking lie!

1256
01:39:05,065 --> 01:39:06,191
That's all this is. No!

1257
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,026
Fuck.

1258
01:39:08,861 --> 01:39:09,987
No.

1259
01:39:10,487 --> 01:39:12,364
I know, I understand.

1260
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:14,662
This is along way.

1261
01:39:14,825 --> 01:39:15,825
You understand?

1262
01:39:15,868 --> 01:39:18,246
I am not taking you
to North Dakota.

1263
01:39:21,415 --> 01:39:24,715
I am fucked up.
And I cannot get you there.

1264
01:39:24,877 --> 01:39:28,006
It is a two-day drive.
And I am not taking you...

1265
01:39:28,172 --> 01:39:30,891
Don't fucking hit me!

1266
01:39:31,049 --> 01:39:32,050
Don't hit me!

1267
01:39:32,885 --> 01:39:34,057
Jonah, Gideon...

1268
01:39:34,178 --> 01:39:35,321
Stop saying those names.
Rebecca...

1269
01:39:35,345 --> 01:39:36,346
Delilah, Rictor.

1270
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:37,932
Right now.
Stop saying those names.

1271
01:39:38,056 --> 01:39:39,228
Stop it! Stop!

1272
01:39:39,349 --> 01:39:40,521
Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca...

1273
01:39:40,684 --> 01:39:43,062
Fuck it. Fine, fine.

1274
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,193
You wanna go'?

1275
01:39:45,272 --> 01:39:47,115
I'll take you there.

1276
01:39:47,566 --> 01:39:49,068
See for yourself.

1277
01:39:49,401 --> 01:39:51,654
Let's go to fucking fantasy land.

1278
01:40:04,583 --> 01:40:05,935
<i>We understand the importance</i>

1279
01:40:05,959 --> 01:40:06,960
<i>of containment, Dr. Rice.</i>

1280
01:40:07,252 --> 01:40:08,396
But you can't leave
a war zone behind

1281
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:09,421
like you did in Juarez.

1282
01:40:09,588 --> 01:40:10,773
Well, try to remind yourselves

1283
01:40:10,797 --> 01:40:12,192
that these are all
little killing machines.

1284
01:40:12,216 --> 01:40:14,235
Machines who would've happily
disemboweled your family.

1285
01:40:14,259 --> 01:40:15,260
Not all.

1286
01:40:16,428 --> 01:40:18,271
I was told you want
these assets off-board,

1287
01:40:18,388 --> 01:40:19,480
dead or alive.

1288
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:20,892
Are you changing my brief?

1289
01:40:21,058 --> 01:40:22,105
No.

1290
01:40:22,309 --> 01:40:23,606
All right, then.

1291
01:40:25,437 --> 01:40:26,563
Save tissue from this one.

1292
01:40:26,730 --> 01:40:28,824
He's a good tracker
and had a high IQ.

1293
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:35,615
Here you go.

1294
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:13,360
Hey.

1295
01:41:21,159 --> 01:41:22,160
Hmm'?

1296
01:41:22,369 --> 01:41:23,666
Let me drive.

1297
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:27,633
Absolutely not.

1298
01:41:33,297 --> 01:41:34,844
Quit looking at me.

1299
01:41:39,261 --> 01:41:40,513
<i>No comprende.</i>

1300
01:41:42,014 --> 01:41:43,516
You are dying.

1301
01:41:46,393 --> 01:41:47,861
You want to die.

1302
01:41:50,731 --> 01:41:52,233
Charles told me.

1303
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,579
What else did he tell you?

1304
01:41:58,030 --> 01:41:59,577
To not let you.

1305
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:13,553
Hey, hey, hey!

1306
01:42:20,761 --> 01:42:21,762
Rest.

1307
01:45:06,343 --> 01:45:07,845
Keep it steady.

1308
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:11,773
Swing him toward me.

1309
01:45:14,267 --> 01:45:15,268
Yeah.

1310
01:45:17,854 --> 01:45:20,073
Easy. Easy

1311
01:45:53,265 --> 01:45:54,983
Is this good' Rictor?

1312
01:45:55,433 --> 01:45:56,650
No, not so much. Less.

1313
01:46:02,941 --> 01:46:04,409
Hey!

1314
01:46:10,949 --> 01:46:12,246
Where am I?

1315
01:46:14,119 --> 01:46:15,792
Hey, what is it?

1316
01:46:16,162 --> 01:46:17,459
Where did you get that?

1317
01:46:17,622 --> 01:46:18,965
Where we came from.

1318
01:46:19,624 --> 01:46:20,624
They gave it to us

1319
01:46:20,667 --> 01:46:21,811
when we would fight.
It makes you stronger.

1320
01:46:21,835 --> 01:46:23,633
It makes you crazy,
is what it does.

1321
01:46:23,753 --> 01:46:24,754
It'll kill you.

1322
01:46:24,838 --> 01:46:26,840
No, not if you use it
in small doses.

1323
01:46:27,507 --> 01:46:28,804
It's helping you heal.

1324
01:46:30,302 --> 01:46:31,645
Where's Laura?

1325
01:46:31,803 --> 01:46:33,771
She's asleep down there.

1326
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:35,807
Do you want me to wake her up'?

1327
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:44,657
No.

1328
01:47:05,837 --> 01:47:07,555
You had a nightmare.

1329
01:47:11,384 --> 01:47:13,182
Do you have nightmares?

1330
01:47:14,471 --> 01:47:15,472
Si.

1331
01:47:18,558 --> 01:47:20,310
People hurt me.

1332
01:47:22,354 --> 01:47:23,856
Mine are different.

1333
01:47:30,028 --> 01:47:31,496
I hurt people.

1334
01:47:49,339 --> 01:47:50,886
You know what it is.

1335
01:47:52,717 --> 01:47:54,594
It's made out of Adamantium.

1336
01:47:55,387 --> 01:47:57,606
It's what they put inside of us.

1337
01:47:58,556 --> 01:48:00,354
That's why it can kill us.

1338
01:48:02,185 --> 01:48:04,529
Probably what is killing me now.

1339
01:48:06,564 --> 01:48:07,861
Anyway...

1340
01:48:08,441 --> 01:48:10,193
I got this a long time ago...

1341
01:48:11,569 --> 01:48:15,073
and I kept it as a reminder
of what I am.

1342
01:48:17,283 --> 01:48:19,251
Now I keep it to, uh...

1343
01:48:26,126 --> 01:48:27,423
Actually, uh...

1344
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:33,133
I was thinking of
shooting myself with it.

1345
01:48:33,758 --> 01:48:35,260
Like Charles said.

1346
01:48:40,974 --> 01:48:42,942
I've hurt people, too.

1347
01:48:45,937 --> 01:48:48,781
You're gonna have to learn
how to live with that.

1348
01:48:58,324 --> 01:49:00,326
They were bad people.

1349
01:49:04,122 --> 01:49:05,795
All the same.

1350
01:50:20,824 --> 01:50:23,077
Not funny.
That is not funny!

1351
01:50:24,702 --> 01:50:26,045
Hey! Hey, pal.

1352
01:50:26,204 --> 01:50:28,548
How long have I been out?

1353
01:50:30,166 --> 01:50:31,446
How long have I been
in that bed?

1354
01:50:31,543 --> 01:50:32,840
Two days.

1355
01:50:33,002 --> 01:50:34,313
You've been sitting here
for two days?

1356
01:50:34,337 --> 01:50:35,898
Hey, go inside and tell
everyone to get packing.

1357
01:50:35,922 --> 01:50:37,642
You can't do that.
You can't just stay here.

1358
01:50:37,674 --> 01:50:39,551
We had to wait.
It was the plan.

1359
01:50:39,717 --> 01:50:42,061
And everyone had till today
to find their way here.

1360
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:43,220
If you keep waiting,

1361
01:50:43,263 --> 01:50:44,865
Alkali will find you
and they will kill you all.

1362
01:50:44,889 --> 01:50:45,936
You need to get out!

1363
01:50:46,015 --> 01:50:48,109
We're leaving tomorrow
before dawn.

1364
01:50:48,518 --> 01:50:50,111
We're gonna cross the border.

1365
01:50:50,270 --> 01:50:51,897
It's a safe haven.

1366
01:50:53,106 --> 01:50:54,358
Same coordinates?

1367
01:50:54,524 --> 01:50:56,743
Yes, between noon and 5:00.

1368
01:50:56,901 --> 01:50:59,245
<i>Satellites are blind then.</i>

1369
01:50:59,404 --> 01:51:00,496
<i>Your asylum approved.</i>

1370
01:51:00,613 --> 01:51:01,705
COPY!

1371
01:51:17,755 --> 01:51:19,428
Swing it to your right, Laura.

1372
01:51:22,927 --> 01:51:24,770
A little more. Yeah.

1373
01:51:24,929 --> 01:51:26,272
You see the woods?

1374
01:51:28,391 --> 01:51:29,483
Si.

1375
01:51:30,059 --> 01:51:31,539
It's an eight mile hike
through there.

1376
01:51:32,645 --> 01:51:33,771
And you see that pass?

1377
01:51:33,938 --> 01:51:35,110
Mm-hmm.

1378
01:51:35,273 --> 01:51:36,399
That's the border.

1379
01:51:38,276 --> 01:51:40,119
That's where we will be safe.

1380
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:48,957
Come inside.

1381
01:51:55,793 --> 01:51:57,340
Laura told me
all that you did for her.

1382
01:51:57,795 --> 01:51:59,843
She was lucky to have you.

1383
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:04,268
Take it.
She says it's yours.

1384
01:52:06,137 --> 01:52:08,686
That's why you did it, right?

1385
01:52:10,934 --> 01:52:12,686
Yeah, well...

1386
01:52:13,478 --> 01:52:16,322
Look, I don't need it.
You do, okay?

1387
01:52:16,648 --> 01:52:18,321
Suit yourself.

1388
01:52:39,963 --> 01:52:41,636
Your friends, they seem nice.

1389
01:52:41,798 --> 01:52:42,845
Kind of reminds me...

1390
01:52:44,509 --> 01:52:45,977
Hey, hey, what's going on?

1391
01:52:46,469 --> 01:52:47,470
Huh?

1392
01:52:49,013 --> 01:52:50,390
You're with your pals.
You made it.

1393
01:52:51,391 --> 01:52:52,893
Where will you go?

1394
01:52:54,018 --> 01:52:55,520
Nearest bar, for starters.

1395
01:52:56,854 --> 01:52:59,323
Hey, I got you here.
That's all I signed up for.

1396
01:52:59,482 --> 01:53:01,359
I even gave back the money.

1397
01:53:01,526 --> 01:53:02,573
Such a nice man.

1398
01:53:02,694 --> 01:53:04,867
Hey, I never asked for this!

1399
01:53:05,571 --> 01:53:07,369
All right? Charles
never asked for this.

1400
01:53:07,532 --> 01:53:09,409
Caliban never asked for this.

1401
01:53:10,201 --> 01:53:12,249
And they are six feet
under the ground!

1402
01:53:13,371 --> 01:53:15,373
Now, I don't know what
Charles put in your head...

1403
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:18,339
but I am not whatever it is
you think I am, okay?

1404
01:53:19,711 --> 01:53:22,009
I only met you,
like, a week ago.

1405
01:53:23,214 --> 01:53:25,182
You got your Rebecca,
your Delilah...

1406
01:53:25,341 --> 01:53:27,059
your blah, blah, blah, whatever.

1407
01:53:27,218 --> 01:53:28,845
Everything you asked for,
you've got it!

1408
01:53:31,889 --> 01:53:33,766
And it is better this way.

1409
01:53:35,226 --> 01:53:37,194
Because I suck at this.

1410
01:53:38,896 --> 01:53:42,025
Bad shit happens to people
I care about.

1411
01:53:42,191 --> 01:53:43,864
You understand me?

1412
01:53:45,945 --> 01:53:47,447
Then I'll be fine.

1413
01:55:55,450 --> 01:55:58,374
Run!
Towards the mountains! Run!

1414
01:57:08,481 --> 01:57:09,778
Run, Bobby, run!

1415
01:57:14,946 --> 01:57:15,947
Ah!

1416
01:57:33,881 --> 01:57:35,383
Go! Go!

1417
01:57:36,008 --> 01:57:37,009
Move faster!

1418
01:57:37,176 --> 01:57:39,270
We need to reach them before
they get to the border.

1419
01:58:56,088 --> 01:58:57,340
Move out!

1420
01:58:57,506 --> 01:58:58,507
Let's go, let's go!

1421
01:59:00,343 --> 01:59:01,811
Run! Run!

1422
01:59:01,969 --> 01:59:04,563
Corre, Jonah! Run!

1423
01:59:11,145 --> 01:59:12,692
I want you to breathe.

1424
01:59:12,855 --> 01:59:14,152
It's just a flesh wound, baby.

1425
01:59:30,414 --> 01:59:31,415
There she is.

1426
01:59:31,624 --> 01:59:32,671
We got her.

1427
01:59:35,378 --> 01:59:37,472
Back it up! Contain her.

1428
02:00:04,073 --> 02:00:05,120
Get behind me!

1429
02:00:26,637 --> 02:00:28,435
You took all the medicine.

1430
02:00:30,015 --> 02:00:31,232
It's wearing off.

1431
02:00:58,002 --> 02:00:59,345
Go to your friends.

1432
02:01:00,588 --> 02:01:01,589
Go.

1433
02:01:03,090 --> 02:01:04,216
Laura?

1434
02:01:06,218 --> 02:01:07,561
You'll know when.

1435
02:01:10,556 --> 02:01:11,933
<i>Mucus</i>

1436
02:01:19,690 --> 02:01:20,942
Nine o'clock.

1437
02:01:22,985 --> 02:01:25,238
That green juice
is wearin' off, huh'?

1438
02:01:26,238 --> 02:01:28,787
You know, for an old mute,
ifs kind of a short high.

1439
02:01:29,241 --> 02:01:30,788
Be hard to
keep them claws out, soon.

1440
02:01:30,951 --> 02:01:32,794
Waste this dick, Logan!

1441
02:01:34,038 --> 02:01:35,756
Please stop,
Mr. Hewlett.

1442
02:01:36,207 --> 02:01:37,309
I'm gonna have to tell these men

1443
02:01:37,333 --> 02:01:38,380
to fire on these children.

1444
02:01:38,542 --> 02:01:39,885
You don't want that.

1445
02:01:40,044 --> 02:01:42,388
You can see the effects of
the serum are wearing off.

1446
02:01:42,546 --> 02:01:45,140
You will not survive
further wounds.

1447
02:01:45,382 --> 02:01:46,929
Allow me to introduce myself.

1448
02:01:47,301 --> 02:01:48,302
I'm Zander Rice.

1449
02:01:49,470 --> 02:01:51,564
I believe you knew my father
on the Weapon X Program.

1450
02:01:51,722 --> 02:01:55,272
Yeah. He's the asshole
who put this poison in me.

1451
02:01:56,310 --> 02:01:57,778
Yes, he was one of them.

1452
02:01:59,188 --> 02:02:00,940
I think I might have killed him.

1453
02:02:02,274 --> 02:02:03,400
I think you're right.

1454
02:02:03,484 --> 02:02:05,004
Why don't you show
some respect, mutie?

1455
02:02:05,069 --> 02:02:07,037
You're lookin' at the man
who wiped out your kind.

1456
02:02:07,613 --> 02:02:09,536
My friend Donald overstates.

1457
02:02:10,574 --> 02:02:13,293
He makes it sound more brutal
than intended.

1458
02:02:13,452 --> 02:02:16,706
The goal was
not to end mutant kind...

1459
02:02:16,872 --> 02:02:18,169
but to control it.

1460
02:02:20,292 --> 02:02:21,418
I realized

1461
02:02:21,502 --> 02:02:23,146
we needn't stop perfecting
what we eat and drink.

1462
02:02:23,170 --> 02:02:24,231
That we could use those products

1463
02:02:24,255 --> 02:02:25,302
to perfect ourselves.

1464
02:02:26,423 --> 02:02:27,720
To distribute gene therapy

1465
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:29,143
discreetly through everything...

1466
02:02:29,301 --> 02:02:31,520
from sweet drinks
to breakfast cereals.

1467
02:02:31,679 --> 02:02:32,805
And it worked.

1468
02:02:32,972 --> 02:02:35,475
Random mutancy
went the way of polio.

1469
02:02:35,641 --> 02:02:36,938
We embarked
on our next endeavor.

1470
02:02:37,142 --> 02:02:38,769
Growing mutants of your own.

1471
02:02:38,936 --> 02:02:39,996
Precisely.
Dangerous times, James.

1472
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:41,021
You can't...

1473
02:02:41,438 --> 02:02:42,518
Argh!

1474
02:02:43,524 --> 02:02:44,884
Argh!

1475
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:01,041
Showtime, boy!

1476
02:03:37,745 --> 02:03:39,622
Get up, boy.
Get up, boy!

1477
02:03:44,543 --> 02:03:45,760
He did that. Get up!

1478
02:03:59,099 --> 02:04:00,772
Laura! No!

1479
02:04:05,814 --> 02:04:06,815
Laura!

1480
02:04:54,279 --> 02:04:55,280
Please.

1481
02:05:30,190 --> 02:05:31,191
Ah!

1482
02:05:38,741 --> 02:05:39,788
Go.

1483
02:05:41,577 --> 02:05:42,578
Let's go.

1484
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:44,121
Go.

1485
02:05:45,581 --> 02:05:47,083
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

1486
02:05:47,791 --> 02:05:50,010
Go! Get out of here! Go!

1487
02:05:53,714 --> 02:05:55,842
Go. Go, go, go!

1488
02:06:00,262 --> 02:06:01,684
GO, go!

1489
02:06:01,889 --> 02:06:02,936
Go!

1490
02:06:03,307 --> 02:06:04,354
Run!

1491
02:06:04,558 --> 02:06:05,559
No!

1492
02:06:06,393 --> 02:06:07,861
No!

1493
02:06:45,516 --> 02:06:46,984
No, no. No.

1494
02:07:11,917 --> 02:07:13,635
Take your friends, and run.

1495
02:07:13,794 --> 02:07:15,011
No.

1496
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:18,340
Run. They'll keep
coming and coming.

1497
02:07:18,507 --> 02:07:21,181
Listen, you don't have
to fight anymore.

1498
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:27,524
Go, go.

1499
02:07:35,065 --> 02:07:37,113
Don't be what they made you.

1500
02:07:45,117 --> 02:07:47,336
Laura... Laura.“

1501
02:07:51,748 --> 02:07:52,874
Daddy.

1502
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:04,766
So, this is what it feels like.

1503
02:08:07,014 --> 02:08:08,015
No!

1504
02:08:15,898 --> 02:08:16,899
No!

1505
02:08:30,579 --> 02:08:31,705
Daddy.

1506
02:08:32,414 --> 02:08:33,415
Dad.

1507
02:09:05,322 --> 02:09:08,166
"A man has to be
what he is, Joey."

1508
02:09:09,534 --> 02:09:11,207
"Can't break the mold."

1509
02:09:14,081 --> 02:09:16,584
"There's no living
with a killing."

1510
02:09:17,709 --> 02:09:19,632
"There's no going back."

1511
02:09:21,797 --> 02:09:23,674
"Right or wrong, it's a brand."

1512
02:09:24,549 --> 02:09:26,472
"A brand that sticks."

1513
02:09:29,513 --> 02:09:31,857
"Now you run on home
to your mother."

1514
02:09:33,058 --> 02:09:36,528
"You tell her
everything's all right."

1515
02:09:38,105 --> 02:09:41,450
"There are no more guns
in the valley.“"

1516
02:09:58,292 --> 02:10:00,294
Let's go.
We gotta move.

1517
02:11:16,203 --> 02:11:19,924
<i>There's a man goin' 'round
takin' names</i>

1518
02:11:20,916 --> 02:11:24,762
<i>And he decides who to free
and who to blame</i>

1519
02:11:26,463 --> 02:11:29,808
<i>Everybody won't be treated
all the same</i>

1520
02:11:31,176 --> 02:11:34,305
<i>There?! be a golden {adder
reaching down</i>

1521
02:11:37,391 --> 02:11:39,940
<i>When the man comes around</i>

1522
02:11:43,688 --> 02:11:47,318
<i>The hairs on your arm
will stand up</i>

1523
02:11:48,610 --> 02:11:52,240
<i>At the tenor in each sip
and in each sup</i>

1524
02:11:53,782 --> 02:11:57,127
<i>For you partake
of that last offered cup</i>

1525
02:11:58,662 --> 02:12:02,212
<i>O1 disappear
into the putters ground</i>

1526
02:12:04,709 --> 02:12:06,711
<i>When the man comes around</i>

1527
02:12:08,839 --> 02:12:11,558
<i>Hear the trumpets
hear the pipers</i>

1528
02:12:13,343 --> 02:12:16,472
<i>One hundred million
angels singing</i>

1529
02:12:18,557 --> 02:12:23,233
<i>Multitudes are marching
to the big kettle drum</i>

1530
02:12:24,771 --> 02:12:27,991
<i>Voices callin', voices cryin'</i>

1531
02:12:29,693 --> 02:12:32,867
<i>Some are born an' some are dyin'</i>

1532
02:12:34,156 --> 02:12:37,877
<i>It's Alpha's and Omega's
kingdom come</i>

1533
02:12:39,035 --> 02:12:43,256
<i>And the whirlwind
is in the thorn tree</i>

1534
02:12:44,374 --> 02:12:47,628
<i>"(he virgins are all
trimming their wicks"</i>

1535
02:12:49,296 --> 02:12:53,642
<i>The whirlwind
is in the thorn tree</i>

1536
02:12:54,176 --> 02:12:57,771
<i>It's hard for thee
to kick against the pricks</i>

1537
02:13:01,349 --> 02:13:05,024
<i>Till Armageddon
no Shalam, no Shalom</i>

1538
02:13:06,396 --> 02:13:09,946
<i>Then the father hen will
call his chickens home</i>

1539
02:13:11,443 --> 02:13:14,617
<i>The wise men will bow down
before the throne</i>

1540
02:13:16,323 --> 02:13:19,748
<i>And at his feet they?!
cast their golden crown</i>

1541
02:13:22,412 --> 02:13:24,790
<i>When the man comes around</i>

1542
02:13:26,249 --> 02:13:30,880
<i>Whoever is unjust
let him be unjust still</i>

1543
02:13:31,630 --> 02:13:35,885
<i>Whoever is righteous
let him be righteous still</i>

1544
02:13:36,176 --> 02:13:40,727
<i>Whoever is filthy
let him be filthy still</i>

1545
02:13:41,181 --> 02:13:44,355
<i>Listen to the words
long written down</i>

1546
02:13:46,895 --> 02:13:49,239
<i>When the man comes around</i>

1547
02:13:50,982 --> 02:13:54,282
<i>Hear the trumpets
