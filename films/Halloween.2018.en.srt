2
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:31,427
You're not cold
or anything, are you?

3
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:33,429
Everything all right?

4
00:01:33,431 --> 00:01:35,464
Are you taking any medication?

5
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:37,535
Hmm?

6
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:40,070
Thank you.

7
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:41,705
How are you doing this morning?

8
00:01:41,707 --> 00:01:43,940
Did you have a restful sleep
last night?

9
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:45,475
Oh, yeah.

10
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:46,610
- You did?
- I did.

11
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:48,445
- Any dreams?
- Nope.

12
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:49,980
Sometimes we don't
remember our dreams, you know?

13
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:50,981
That's right.

14
00:01:50,983 --> 00:01:52,849
We do dream,
but we don't remember

15
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:54,684
- when we wake up.
- No.

16
00:01:54,686 --> 00:01:56,519
But if we are dreaming some

17
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:58,688
just before we wake up,
we remember those.

18
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,823
That's right.

19
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:01,225
Did you know...

20
00:02:01,227 --> 00:02:03,760
A little, uh...
uh, useful information.

21
00:02:05,497 --> 00:02:07,098
- Yeah.
- When we wake up

22
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,766
and say, "The whole night,

23
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,567
I was dreaming
this and that and everything,"

24
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,169
it's only 45 minutes maximum.

25
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:15,239
- Did you know that?
- Yeah. No, I did not. Yeah.

26
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:18,175
So the ordinary dream
is ten or 15 minutes.

27
00:02:18,177 --> 00:02:19,944
I'll see you all later.

28
00:02:19,946 --> 00:02:22,480
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to see my patients.

29
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:23,748
Testing. Testing.

30
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,116
Check, check, check.
One, two, three.

31
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:26,717
Testing. One, two, three.

32
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,887
We are now at Smith's Grove,

33
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,990
uh, rehabilitation facility.

34
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:34,026
We're here today
to interview a patient

35
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:38,196
that's spent the last 40 years
in captivity

36
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:41,667
and, by all accounts,
has not uttered a word.

37
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:42,701
This monster...

38
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:50,142
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

39
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:51,643
I'm Dr. Ranbir Sartain.

40
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:53,111
Great to finally meet you.

41
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:55,981
Thank you so much for taking
the time to meet with us today.

42
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:57,683
We were hoping to have
this opportunity

43
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:59,918
before he's transferred
to the new facility.

44
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Glass Hill
is far less accommodating.

45
00:03:01,922 --> 00:03:03,822
Glass Hill is the pit of hell.

46
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:06,558
For years, he's been kept here
to be studied.

47
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,593
I suppose the state
has lost interest

48
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:09,896
in discovering
anything further.

49
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,799
Well, that's why we're here.

50
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:14,567
Michael has been
my life's obsession.

51
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,570
I've examined every single
case file written on him.

52
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,840
I was a student of Dr. Loomis
before he passed away.

53
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:23,042
And then I lobbied
the University of Illinois

54
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:25,578
to be assigned
to Michael myself.

55
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,046
Any progress?

56
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:30,583
Well, he's been seen by
over 50 clinical psychiatrists,

57
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,987
and with each,
many different opinions.

58
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:36,056
Dr. Loomis was the only one
to see him in the wild.

59
00:03:36,058 --> 00:03:38,993
And he concluded he was
nothing more than pure evil.

60
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:42,062
Our patients get fresh air,
sunshine,

61
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:46,600
a view, proper exercise,
healthy diet.

62
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,736
It pains me
to see him transferred

63
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:52,606
to that less-than-desirable
facility.

64
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,744
And there he is.

65
00:03:55,678 --> 00:03:57,144
He can speak.

66
00:03:57,146 --> 00:03:58,879
He just chooses not to.

67
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:02,016
I'd love to stand
closer to him, if I may.

68
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:05,020
Get a sense of his awareness,
or lack of awareness.

69
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:08,156
Oh, make no mistake,
he's aware.

70
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:10,258
He was watching you
as you arrived.

71
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,162
Perhaps you'd like to tie
your left shoelace?

72
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:17,932
Mr. Tovoli here, the gentleman
with the umbrella,

73
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:20,201
has a fixation for such things.

74
00:04:20,203 --> 00:04:22,070
Underestimate no one.

75
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:23,140
Of course.

76
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:28,246
And now step up
to the yellow line.

77
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:31,780
And no further.

78
00:04:31,782 --> 00:04:34,985
Do not cross the line
under any circumstances.

79
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:38,222
Michael.

80
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:41,323
Michael.

81
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:44,929
I've got some people
who'd like to meet you.

82
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:49,200
Hello, Michael.

83
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:53,803
My name is Aaron Korey.

84
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:55,938
I've been following your case
for years

85
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,309
and still know
very little about you.

86
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:01,246
I'd like to know more.

87
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,682
About that night.

88
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:08,220
About those involved.

89
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:13,423
Do you ever think about them,
Michael?

90
00:05:13,425 --> 00:05:16,261
Feel guilt about their fate?

91
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,910
I borrowed something
from a friend

92
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:36,216
at the attorney general's
office, Michael.

93
00:05:57,036 --> 00:05:59,839
You feel it,
don't you, Michael?

94
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:07,446
You feel the mask.

95
00:06:07,448 --> 00:06:10,848
Figaro. Figaro!

96
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,190
Say something, Michael.

97
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:21,460
Say something.

98
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:34,474
You can feel it, can't you?

99
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:37,510
It's a part of you, Michael.

100
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:41,080
It's a part of you.

101
00:06:43,418 --> 00:06:44,750
Say something.

102
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:47,453
Say something, Michael.

103
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:02,802
Say something!

104
00:08:44,243 --> 00:08:46,276
<i>What is it we're after?</i>

105
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:48,345
<i>Okay, well,</i>

106
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:52,182
having witnessed the animal
in its captive state

107
00:08:52,184 --> 00:08:54,451
and failed to provoke
any sort of response,

108
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:58,188
we now track down
its counterpart.

109
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,460
Could it be that one monster
has created another?

110
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:05,195
And although the iron bars
and barbed wire

111
00:09:05,197 --> 00:09:08,433
that separate them
are both strong and sharp,

112
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:10,635
the metaphysical lines
are blurred and slight.

113
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:15,306
Both exist in isolation,
fettered by their own fear

114
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:17,141
- and hatred of one another.
- This one.

115
00:09:17,143 --> 00:09:18,176
Here?

116
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:20,545
Could it be that the only hope

117
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:23,247
- of rehabilitation...
- Spooky.

118
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:24,949
...is through confrontation?

119
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:26,451
"Access has been denied.

120
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:28,620
Private property. No trespassing."

121
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:30,490
You might need this.

122
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:40,265
Dana, journalists don't pay
for their interviews.

123
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:41,533
Smile.

124
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:43,537
We're on camera.

125
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:52,945
Yes.

126
00:09:52,947 --> 00:09:56,250
Hello. Um, we're looking
for Laurie Strode.

127
00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:04,223
We're, uh, um...

128
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:07,226
we're-we're making a podcast,
and, uh...

129
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:09,364
We're investigative
journalists.

130
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:14,536
If you have a moment,
we've traveled a very long way.

131
00:10:16,238 --> 00:10:19,274
How does $3,000 sound?

132
00:11:10,126 --> 00:11:12,061
Hello.

133
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:16,063
May we come in?

134
00:11:16,065 --> 00:11:18,335
And-and sit down and talk?

135
00:11:29,546 --> 00:11:31,079
So...

136
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:33,548
Aaron and I have made several

137
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,719
award-winning
public radio exposés.

138
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:38,286
Our last project shed new light

139
00:11:38,288 --> 00:11:40,055
on a murder case
from 20 years ago.

140
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:45,361
We like to reexamine incidents
with an unbiased lens.

141
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:47,196
I believe there's
a lot to learn

142
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:48,666
from the horrors
you experienced.

143
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:51,767
There's nothing to learn.

144
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:54,770
There are no new insights

145
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:57,408
or discoveries.

146
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,109
So, is he real?

147
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:01,711
Who?

148
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:03,814
The Boogeyman.

149
00:12:03,816 --> 00:12:05,381
I read you quoted...

150
00:12:05,383 --> 00:12:06,617
You don't believe
in the Boogeyman?

151
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:13,289
I believe in Michael Myers,
deranged serial killer, but...

152
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,528
the Boogeyman, no.

153
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:19,698
Well, you should.

154
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,733
Okay.

155
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:24,768
Michael Myers is a human being

156
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,871
who killed his sister
when he was six years old.

157
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,575
Then he came after you.

158
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:32,676
We just want to know why.

159
00:12:32,678 --> 00:12:34,578
We want a glimpse
inside his mind.

160
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,148
That's why your story
is so important.

161
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,152
My story?

162
00:12:41,153 --> 00:12:42,687
Two failed marriages.

163
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:46,624
Rocky relationship with your
daughter and granddaughter.

164
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:50,697
Michael Myers
murdered five people.

165
00:12:52,165 --> 00:12:55,433
And he's a human being
we need to understand?

166
00:12:55,435 --> 00:12:57,702
I'm twice divorced.

167
00:12:57,704 --> 00:12:59,673
And I'm a basket case.

168
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:05,209
They're transferring him.

169
00:13:05,211 --> 00:13:07,612
Tomorrow, 7:00.

170
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:09,815
He'll-he'll be locked away
until the end of his days.

171
00:13:09,817 --> 00:13:11,552
That's the idea.

172
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:16,154
Let's talk about
when the state came

173
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:17,723
to take your daughter away.

174
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:19,458
She was 12 years old.

175
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,760
They said you were
an unfit mother.

176
00:13:21,762 --> 00:13:24,599
How long until
you regained custody?

177
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:29,835
I didn't.

178
00:13:29,837 --> 00:13:32,773
But you already knew that.

179
00:13:34,408 --> 00:13:36,408
Laurie, we saw him.

180
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,812
We met with Michael.

181
00:13:38,814 --> 00:13:41,246
I showed him the mask.

182
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:43,215
There was nothing.

183
00:13:43,217 --> 00:13:45,952
No response. Nothing.

184
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:47,921
He won't talk to anyone.

185
00:13:47,923 --> 00:13:50,423
Never has, but...

186
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:53,493
I think he might speak
with you.

187
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:56,229
So, why don't you sit down
with him

188
00:13:56,231 --> 00:14:01,768
and say all the things
you must be longing to say.

189
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,237
Come with us,

190
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:07,409
and let us help you
free yourself.

191
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,846
Please.

192
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:17,854
Time's up.

193
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,525
I'll accept my payment.

194
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:27,864
Get out.

195
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:31,399
You want to shit under my sink?

196
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:33,969
I will murder you
and your whole family.

197
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:38,740
I switched from marshmallow
fluff to peanut butter.

198
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:41,542
See if those little bastards
eat that.

199
00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:43,310
- That ought to kill them.
- Morning.

200
00:14:43,312 --> 00:14:45,947
I rescheduled my last session,
so I can make it tonight.

201
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:47,516
You really didn't
have to do that, Mom.

202
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:48,917
It's not a big deal.

203
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,552
You made it into
the National Honor Society.

204
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:51,887
- Yeah.
- That is a very big deal.

205
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:53,922
I just made it to the top
of my shop class,

206
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:57,959
making birdhouses and, uh,
a checkerboard made of teak.

207
00:14:57,961 --> 00:15:00,829
We're excited to meet Cameron.

208
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:02,965
That whole family, though,
they had a reputation.

209
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,733
- Ray, come on.
- But it's true.

210
00:15:04,735 --> 00:15:06,401
- It's a relevant factor.
- Ray.

211
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:08,004
- Ray.
- Do you remember the one time Lonnie

212
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:09,038
punched that cop in the face?

213
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,338
- Ray.
- That was a...

214
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,841
Oh! Mother...

215
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:13,609
Oh, man!

216
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:15,611
I got peanut butter
on my penis.

217
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:17,046
Ew, Dad.

218
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:18,548
Instant karma.

219
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,450
Cameron is a good guy.
He's nothing like that.

220
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,051
You're gonna see
when you meet him tonight.

221
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:25,621
They're all nice guys
until they get you pregnant,

222
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:27,924
and then you gotta drive
in their pickup trucks,

223
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,892
and you clean their guns,
and you got children,

224
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:32,595
and you clean guns, and you
like to get high with them,

225
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:33,863
and then y'all get fat.

226
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:34,965
Hey, Dad?

227
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,466
- What?
- Can you stop?

228
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,437
I gotta clean
this peanut butter off my hand.

229
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,681
Did you invite Grandmother
like you said you would?

230
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,383
About tonight.
You said that you'd...

231
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,952
- Oh.
- ...invite her.

232
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,354
Right. I did.

233
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,989
- You did?
- Yeah.

234
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,657
I talked to her yesterday.

235
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,860
She's not gonna be able
to come, honey. I'm sorry.

236
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,062
Really?

237
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:05,896
Yeah.

238
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,398
Baby, she's agoraphobic.

239
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,835
She needs cognitive
behavioral therapy,

240
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:13,037
so don't take it personally.

241
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,975
That's Vicky. I gotta go.

242
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,777
Hey, I love you.

243
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,513
Have a good day.

244
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:22,914
- Bye, Dad. Love you.
- Okay.

245
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,582
<i>So, my mom's a liar.</i>

246
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,484
<i>What happened?</i>

247
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,852
She said that she invited

248
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,754
my grandmother tonight,
but she didn't.

249
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,556
I mean, she never even
contacted her.

250
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:34,093
- How do you know?
- Because I called her myself.

251
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:35,860
- That's bullshit.
- Yeah.

252
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,931
Dude, what's your mom's deal?
Why would she say that?

253
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:42,400
I don't know. She just tries
to keep me away from her.

254
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,701
Everyone in my family, like,

255
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,872
turns into a total nutcase
this time of year.

256
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:48,941
If I were you guys,
I wouldn't celebrate, either.

257
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:51,644
I would just put up
a Christmas tree instead.

258
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:54,547
Just skip all over the
creepy Halloween shit, right?

259
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:56,916
Does your grandma
ever talk about it?

260
00:16:56,918 --> 00:16:59,084
Yeah, it's pretty much
all she talks about.

261
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:01,453
It defines her life.

262
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,422
She's been traumatized
ever since.

263
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:05,524
Wasn't it her brother
who, like,

264
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,127
cold-blooded murdilated
all those teenagers?

265
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:08,561
No.

266
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:10,529
That's just a bit
that some people made up

267
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:11,965
to make them feel better,
I think.

268
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:14,633
I mean, that is scary to have
a bunch of your friends

269
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:15,969
get butchered
by some random crazy person.

270
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:18,138
Is it, though?
Because, all things considered,

271
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,740
there's a lot worse stuff
that's happening today.

272
00:17:20,742 --> 00:17:23,176
And, like, I mean, what,
a couple people getting killed

273
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:26,079
by one guy with a knife
is not that big of a deal.

274
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:28,548
Dude, her grandmother
was almost fucking murdered.

275
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,518
And she escaped,
and they caught him,

276
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,119
and now he's incarcerated.

277
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:36,489
I-I'm just saying, like,
by today's standards...

278
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:38,092
Just shut the fuck up, Dave.

279
00:17:38,094 --> 00:17:39,626
Shut up.

280
00:17:39,628 --> 00:17:41,095
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, shut up, Dave.

281
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:42,596
Hey, is it cool with you guys

282
00:17:42,598 --> 00:17:44,165
if I explode one
of these pumpkin heads?

283
00:17:45,168 --> 00:17:46,167
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Go for it.

284
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:47,869
Oh, he's serious?

285
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:49,804
- He's serious.
- Oh, God, he's really blowing it up.

286
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:51,806
I know.
He's such a fucking moron.

287
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:52,974
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Oh, Jesus.

288
00:17:52,976 --> 00:17:55,042
Go, go, go, go, go.

289
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:56,978
Happy Halloween!

290
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,046
Ah!

291
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:00,481
Cameron.

292
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:02,116
I got you.
That was a good one.

293
00:18:02,118 --> 00:18:03,484
Yes, that was very good.

294
00:18:03,486 --> 00:18:04,719
Hey, do you have everything

295
00:18:04,721 --> 00:18:06,221
for your costume
tomorrow night?

296
00:18:06,223 --> 00:18:08,890
- Bonnie and Clyde must roll as one, after all.
- Um...

297
00:18:08,892 --> 00:18:12,094
no, I mean,
I-I'm more focused on tonight.

298
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:13,661
Tonight?

299
00:18:13,663 --> 00:18:15,496
I-I thought you were joking
when you said

300
00:18:15,498 --> 00:18:17,833
your parents
were old-fashioned.

301
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:19,167
- Be nice, okay?
- Okay.

302
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:20,769
It'll be fun.

303
00:18:20,771 --> 00:18:22,704
- I'm excited for tonight.
- I need to calm down.

304
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:25,908
- I'm excited for tonight, okay?
- Okay.

305
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,809
Ooh...

306
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:30,679
Ugh. You guys are just barf,
you know.

307
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:32,481
You're just...
you're two yucky dumpsters,

308
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:34,783
- and I want to go diving. Come here. Mwah!
- No.

309
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:35,751
- Dude, dude.
- Right here, right here, right?

310
00:18:35,753 --> 00:18:37,486
- Oh. Mwah, mwah.
- Dude, you-you got

311
00:18:37,488 --> 00:18:39,155
your little chapped-lip
crusties

312
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:40,622
all over me, man, so thanks.

313
00:18:40,624 --> 00:18:42,091
I know. And you're welcome.

314
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:44,227
- It's gross.
- It's a little part of me for you.

315
00:18:44,229 --> 00:18:45,661
For the rest of your day.

316
00:18:45,663 --> 00:18:46,996
All right? So, do you have

317
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:48,666
everything ready
for your costume tomorrow?

318
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:52,737
- Um... about that...
- What?

319
00:18:53,772 --> 00:18:55,504
Are we seriously not?

320
00:18:55,506 --> 00:18:57,840
You said we were gonna do this
whole Halloween dance together.

321
00:18:57,842 --> 00:18:59,909
Now-now you just...
you ditch me.

322
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,244
I mean, you just...
you-you can't walk

323
00:19:01,246 --> 00:19:02,946
- all over town breaking hearts.
- Okay, okay, okay.

324
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:04,080
- Hey, listen, listen.
- All right?

325
00:19:04,082 --> 00:19:05,949
- Love. Truly.
- Okay, lovebirds, later.

326
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:10,553
Now let's open our books to...

327
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:13,690
Frankl's interpretation.

328
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:18,561
He said,
"Fate took a different course.

329
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:22,800
"I understand how someone who
has nothing left in this world

330
00:19:22,802 --> 00:19:25,636
may still know bliss."

331
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:28,105
His message is totally hopeful.

332
00:19:28,107 --> 00:19:31,809
Even in the most disparaging
of conditions,

333
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:33,644
life can find its meaning,

334
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:36,281
and conversely,
so can one's suffering.

335
00:19:36,283 --> 00:19:38,249
I...

336
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:40,185
can't accept this.

337
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:42,989
Use it for whatever
your heart desires.

338
00:19:44,657 --> 00:19:46,257
I'll save it for college, then.

339
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:47,758
Fuck college.

340
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,829
Go somewhere. Go to Mexico.

341
00:19:50,831 --> 00:19:52,297
Could you imagine?

342
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:54,701
Yeah, I can.

343
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:00,741
Look, don't worry
about your mom.

344
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,309
She will freak.

345
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:06,644
But she'll get over it.

346
00:20:06,646 --> 00:20:08,615
Why can't you?

347
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,686
The Boogeyman?

348
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:17,289
All this hiding,
all this preparation,

349
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,958
it was for nothing.

350
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,193
I mean, it took priority
over your family.

351
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:23,162
It cost you your family.

352
00:20:23,164 --> 00:20:28,136
If the way I raised your mother
means that she hates me...

353
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:32,038
...but that she's prepared

354
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,608
for the horrors of this world,
then...

355
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,178
I can live with that.

356
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:44,786
Say good-bye to Michael,
and get over it.

357
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:48,121
Good-bye.

358
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:21,389
Dr. Samuel Loomis,

359
00:21:21,391 --> 00:21:24,926
January 22, 1979.

360
00:21:24,928 --> 00:21:27,128
Do you wish to give
a statement regarding

361
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,197
your former patient,
Michael Myers?

362
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:32,200
My suggestion is termination.

363
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:34,669
<i>Death is the only solution
for Michael.</i>

364
00:21:34,671 --> 00:21:36,438
A2201. Myers, Michael.

365
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,373
- Toes in line. Keep a line.
- <i>There's nothing</i>

366
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,942
- <i>to be gained from keeping evil alive.</i>
- Hands up!

367
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:43,111
Hands up! Stand up!

368
00:21:43,113 --> 00:21:43,911
A22...

369
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:47,815
<i>A shot of sodium thiopental</i>

370
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:49,851
<i>would render him unconscious.</i>

371
00:21:49,853 --> 00:21:52,287
- A22...
- <i>I'll be with him to make sure</i>

372
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:54,890
<i>his life is extinguished.</i>

373
00:21:54,892 --> 00:21:58,727
My ear on his chest
to hear for myself

374
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:00,762
that his vitals
no longer function

375
00:22:00,764 --> 00:22:03,100
and immediately
incinerate the body.

376
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:06,270
It needs to die.

377
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:09,740
It needs to die!

378
00:22:25,023 --> 00:22:27,190
It needs to die!

379
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:29,959
Keep moving. Let's go.

380
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:31,861
Don't worry, Michael.

381
00:22:31,863 --> 00:22:34,634
I'll be by your side.

382
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:46,177
Michael Myers
is still my patient

383
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:48,245
until he's in
somebody else's care,

384
00:22:48,247 --> 00:22:52,016
so I'm seeing my duty
through till the end.

385
00:22:52,018 --> 00:22:54,187
All right, move out.

386
00:23:18,744 --> 00:23:20,412
...send my DNA away
to a stranger.

387
00:23:20,414 --> 00:23:22,414
Why not? You can find out
some pretty interesting things.

388
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,082
- Don't...
- I found out that I'm part Cherokee.

389
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:26,284
I guess my dad's, like,
seven percent Cherokee.

390
00:23:26,286 --> 00:23:28,186
I know Lonnie.
I went to high school with him.

391
00:23:28,188 --> 00:23:29,554
- He used to sell me peyote.
- Dad.

392
00:23:29,556 --> 00:23:32,190
- Everyone knows Lonnie.
- Yeah. - Dad.

393
00:23:32,192 --> 00:23:33,391
- I'm sorry.
- All right. Um...

394
00:23:33,393 --> 00:23:35,227
this is a massive overshare

395
00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:36,494
- for our new friend.
- No, he did.

396
00:23:36,496 --> 00:23:38,531
I learned a lot about myself
with his dad.

397
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:40,466
- Tripped balls out in the woods, me and his dad.
- Dad.

398
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:42,167
- Boy, Ray...
- Tripping balls. - Dad!

399
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,936
No, really, keep talking.

400
00:23:44,938 --> 00:23:46,439
So, you guys
have big plans for tomorrow

401
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:48,274
- at the high school?
- What are you doing?

402
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:49,874
- Is it a dance or something?
- Yeah, it's a Halloween...

403
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:50,942
- Costumes?
- Halloween dance. Yep.

404
00:23:50,944 --> 00:23:51,943
- Mmm!
- Costume party.

405
00:23:51,945 --> 00:23:53,045
What are you going as?

406
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:56,115
Uh, well, I don't know
if I'm allowed to say.

407
00:23:56,117 --> 00:23:57,116
- Please say.
- Oh, come on.

408
00:23:57,118 --> 00:23:58,351
- Come on.
- I can...? Okay.

409
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,853
Uh, so we're going
as Bonnie and Clyde.

410
00:24:00,855 --> 00:24:02,054
- Oh, that's a great idea.
- Yeah.

411
00:24:02,056 --> 00:24:03,155
- Except...
- Oh!

412
00:24:03,157 --> 00:24:04,123
- Oh. No.
- Ooh.

413
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,324
Okay, so just Bonnie and Clyde.

414
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:06,392
That's it. Bonnie and Clyde.

415
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:07,561
Bonnie and Clyde with a twist.

416
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:08,995
- Classic.
- Yeah!

417
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:10,129
- Yeah! - I love that.
- Nice.

418
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:11,264
- That's so fun.
- You'll see.

419
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,499
You know how it ended, right?

420
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:14,200
- Their story ended a little...
- Yes. Hopefully...

421
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,835
Yes, with the bullets
and the bleeding.

422
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:17,203
- Yeah.
- You have a jalopy

423
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,239
filled with bullet holes
from the G-men?

424
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:20,440
I wish we had one of those.

425
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:22,476
- It was in Laughlin, like a Model A.
- I know.

426
00:24:22,478 --> 00:24:23,878
Did you talk to Grandmother?

427
00:24:25,414 --> 00:24:27,914
Yeah.

428
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,549
She said she was gonna come.

429
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,019
She came to my office.
We had a nice talk.

430
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:33,320
Did you? Really?

431
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:35,122
- That's a first.
- It was nice.

432
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:36,556
- Oh.
- Do you know where she is, then?

433
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,594
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I...
- That part... Oh.

434
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:41,295
- Great timing, Mom. Hi.
- Uh, I...

435
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:42,429
- You made it.
- It ran late. I'm sorry.

436
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:44,931
- Hi. I'm so happy you came.
- Hi, Mom. - Hi, Laurie.

437
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:46,567
- Hi. Hi. I'm, uh...
- Hi.

438
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,035
I'm the grandmother.

439
00:24:48,037 --> 00:24:49,537
Nice to meet you.
I'm Cameron Elam.

440
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:51,004
And we're here
celebrating our daughter

441
00:24:51,006 --> 00:24:52,540
- because of her...
- Yes, I know.

442
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:54,041
How did it go?

443
00:24:54,043 --> 00:24:56,210
Yes. It looks good on you.

444
00:24:56,212 --> 00:24:58,179
You know, I was in
the Honor Society, too.

445
00:24:58,181 --> 00:24:59,314
That's good.
Why don't you sit down, Mom?

446
00:24:59,316 --> 00:25:00,315
- No, I'm good.
- Yeah, have a seat.

447
00:25:00,317 --> 00:25:02,050
Or we could go for a walk,
if you'd like.

448
00:25:02,052 --> 00:25:03,151
- Really? Did it go great? Yeah?
- Yeah.

449
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:04,319
It went really...
it went, um...

450
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:05,987
- Hey, Mom?
- That's mine.

451
00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:08,956
- I thought you quit drinking.
- Mmm.

452
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,225
Mom, what are you doing?
What is this?

453
00:25:11,227 --> 00:25:14,395
You know, this is exactly
why we don't reach out.

454
00:25:14,397 --> 00:25:16,130
Mom.

455
00:25:16,132 --> 00:25:19,301
I'm sorry. I will sit down.

456
00:25:19,303 --> 00:25:20,168
Okay.

457
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,371
Why don't we
press the reset button?

458
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:24,906
Why don't we just
start over, okay?

459
00:25:24,908 --> 00:25:26,040
Mm-hmm.

460
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:28,210
All right, Mom...

461
00:25:28,212 --> 00:25:29,611
- Sorry.
- Mom.

462
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,449
Please stop this.

463
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:38,222
Sorry.

464
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,657
I saw him.

465
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:42,124
The Shape.

466
00:25:42,126 --> 00:25:44,126
- Mom...
- I wanted to kill him.

467
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:46,228
Okay, that's enough, Laurie.

468
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,063
- Laurie, that's enough.
- I didn't know what to do.

469
00:25:48,065 --> 00:25:49,599
- That's enough, Laurie.
- Okay.

470
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:52,369
I think maybe this is a little
bit too much for you, huh?

471
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:54,270
Why don't we go
for a walk, all right?

472
00:25:54,272 --> 00:25:55,238
You said you were gonna try

473
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,206
- to put the past behind you.
- Laurie.

474
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,341
Okay?
Are you gonna try to do that?

475
00:25:58,343 --> 00:26:00,043
That's what you said
you wanted to do.

476
00:26:00,045 --> 00:26:01,044
I can't.

477
00:26:01,046 --> 00:26:02,645
Mom, look at me.

478
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:04,383
Look at me.

479
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,353
- I...
- Should we, uh...

480
00:26:10,355 --> 00:26:14,057
...really hate to say
I told you so, but...

481
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,029
I'm glad you got to see that.

482
00:26:52,098 --> 00:26:55,400
I never told you
how I spent my childhood.

483
00:26:57,571 --> 00:26:59,304
Gotcha.

484
00:26:59,306 --> 00:27:02,174
I learned how to shoot a gun
when I was eight.

485
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:04,077
I learned how to fight.

486
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:08,046
I had nightmares
about the basement.

487
00:27:11,452 --> 00:27:15,053
Social Services came when I was
12 years old and took me away.

488
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,161
I've spent my entire life
trying to get over the paranoia

489
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:25,531
and neuroses
that she has projected on me.

490
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:27,132
Yeah, he kind of reminds me

491
00:27:27,134 --> 00:27:28,501
of, uh, Gary Hogeboom.

492
00:27:28,503 --> 00:27:30,336
Yeah, that quarterback
thing is all messed up.

493
00:27:30,338 --> 00:27:32,474
Good times, right?

494
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:37,243
What is she gonna do
with herself?

495
00:27:37,245 --> 00:27:39,647
I know.
It's not your job to save her.

496
00:27:42,718 --> 00:27:45,819
She'll be all right.

497
00:27:45,821 --> 00:27:48,354
I can't get reception

498
00:27:48,356 --> 00:27:50,056
on this thing
ever since the antenna

499
00:27:50,058 --> 00:27:51,224
was bent at the car wash.

500
00:27:51,226 --> 00:27:53,226
Why do we have
to come out again?

501
00:27:53,228 --> 00:27:54,495
We do this all the time.

502
00:27:54,497 --> 00:27:56,128
What? You don't...
you don't enjoy it?

503
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,598
I-I like being out
in the woods and...

504
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,634
No, I enjoy it, but I'm missing
dance class for this.

505
00:28:00,636 --> 00:28:02,703
And sometimes I would rather
do that than hunting.

506
00:28:02,705 --> 00:28:04,638
I mean, is-is-is dance class
that important to you?

507
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,473
- Yeah, it is.
- You need some more time

508
00:28:06,475 --> 00:28:08,275
- in the woods to go hunting and fishing.
- No.

509
00:28:08,277 --> 00:28:09,610
On weekends,
I'll do it with you, Dad.

510
00:28:09,612 --> 00:28:11,378
Like, I really love
spending time with you,

511
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,380
but right now dancing
is my thing, you know, and...

512
00:28:13,382 --> 00:28:15,215
it really hits me in the heart.
I mean, I...

513
00:28:15,217 --> 00:28:16,651
- Dad, look out!
- Oh!

514
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,625
What the hell
happened to you, Hoss?

515
00:28:23,627 --> 00:28:25,727
Oh, shit.

516
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:27,729
Dad, look.

517
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:30,365
Lumpy, you stay here.

518
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:32,834
I'm gonna make sure
no one's hurt.

519
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,669
- You call the police.
- Okay.

520
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,804
Dad, be careful, please.

521
00:28:36,806 --> 00:28:38,406
Hey, you fellas okay?

522
00:28:41,745 --> 00:28:43,280
You all right?

523
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:55,356
911. What is the emergency?

524
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:59,695
Yes. Um, th-there's been
an accident.

525
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,697
Uh, there's a bus.

526
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:03,432
People running around
in the road.

527
00:29:03,434 --> 00:29:05,734
My dad went to look.
I-I don't know.

528
00:29:05,736 --> 00:29:08,270
Okay. Hold on.

529
00:29:08,272 --> 00:29:09,838
I'll go check.

530
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:29,328
Dad?

531
00:30:12,238 --> 00:30:14,238
Run.

532
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,506
Wait here.

533
00:30:15,508 --> 00:30:17,675
I-I'll go get my dad.

534
00:30:17,677 --> 00:30:19,778
N-No.

535
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,278
Run!

536
00:30:22,783 --> 00:30:24,551
Dad!

537
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,352
Daddy!

538
00:30:44,805 --> 00:30:46,471
Don't shoot. Aah!

539
00:30:46,473 --> 00:30:48,607
- Oh, fuck!
- Fuck!

540
00:31:17,706 --> 00:31:20,375
"Don't need a credit card
to ride this train."

541
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:23,844
Yo, Hawk, listen, the ball come
down loose, that's where

542
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:25,879
- you're gonna mess up at.
- Yo, Hawkins, would you like

543
00:31:25,881 --> 00:31:27,648
a strawberry slushie
or a blue raspberry slushie?

544
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,450
Can you just bring me
a coffee, will you?

545
00:31:29,452 --> 00:31:30,651
I'll get you back later.

546
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:32,586
Pull a slingshot, it'll go
straight down the middle.

547
00:31:32,588 --> 00:31:34,321
But you ain't never gonna
beat my score,

548
00:31:34,323 --> 00:31:35,589
so it makes no difference
what you do.

549
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:36,890
- Say that again.
- You're never gonna

550
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:38,659
beat my score, so it doesn't
make no difference what you do.

551
00:31:38,661 --> 00:31:39,727
Dispatch to unit 601.

552
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:41,695
We have a 10-50 on Marla Road.

553
00:31:41,697 --> 00:31:44,298
Copy that, dispatch.
I'm on my way.

554
00:31:52,675 --> 00:31:54,541
Attention, all units.

555
00:31:54,543 --> 00:31:56,010
We got an officer that's 10-23

556
00:31:56,012 --> 00:31:58,913
and a possible 10-50
on Route 20. Will advise.

557
00:31:58,915 --> 00:32:00,615
Sheriff's Department.

558
00:32:00,617 --> 00:32:02,817
Possible 10-98. Over.

559
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:06,387
If you need assistance,
let yourself be known.

560
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:08,857
Signal 13.

561
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:11,361
Officer down.

562
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:14,664
I repeat: officer down.

563
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:18,566
I need assistance.
Send backup right away.

564
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,636
Uh, roger that.

565
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:22,838
Ten-one, officer down.

566
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,875
Sending EMT
and all available units.

567
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,511
Ooh.

568
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,922
Show your hands!

569
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:44,860
I've been shot.

570
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,563
All right, stay with me.
Help's on the way.

571
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,498
What happened in here?

572
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,836
Did he escape?

573
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:54,771
Who?

574
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,809
Did who escape?

575
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,379
Well, I got a cousin
works at a graveyard

576
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,482
- not too far from here.
- Hmm.

577
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,117
They got war generals,

578
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:10,487
philanthropists,
a beatnik poet.

579
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,988
They got Muddy Waters.

580
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,623
Oh, and they got Bernie Mac.

581
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,127
People come from all over
to pay respects.

582
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:17,828
But this is Haddonfield,

583
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,697
and this is our only claim
to fame.

584
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,766
Maybe you can explain to me

585
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:24,904
what's so special
about Judith Myers.

586
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:30,174
As she sat combing her hair,
unaware,

587
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:32,510
her six-year-old brother
crept in quietly

588
00:33:32,512 --> 00:33:34,812
with a kitchen knife.

589
00:33:34,814 --> 00:33:39,050
He then proceeded
to slice the base of her skull,

590
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:41,953
scraping her spinal cord.

591
00:33:41,955 --> 00:33:43,855
When she turned,

592
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:47,658
raising her hands
in self-defense,

593
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,962
he continued stabbing

594
00:33:49,964 --> 00:33:53,000
into the nerves
and arteries of her palms.

595
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:57,668
Three more stabs
into her sternum,

596
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,773
penetrating her heart.

597
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:10,985
Hawkins.

598
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:15,621
Still checking I.D.'s
of the patients we recovered

599
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:17,489
to figure out who's who.

600
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:18,991
Almost all accounted for.

601
00:34:18,993 --> 00:34:22,028
Two of them were checking their
e-mails at a local library.

602
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,795
Just found three of 'em
holding hands,

603
00:34:23,797 --> 00:34:26,531
chasing butterflies
at a flea market off the 220.

604
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:27,901
Butterflies?

605
00:34:27,903 --> 00:34:30,636
Still no idea
what really went down.

606
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:33,239
Any word from
Mr. Rip van Winkle over here?

607
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:35,174
Nurses say
he's been in and out,

608
00:34:35,176 --> 00:34:36,542
lost a lot of blood.

609
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:37,977
Somehow managed
to fall on a bullet.

610
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:39,746
I'm trying to get
the whole story

611
00:34:39,748 --> 00:34:41,881
because here's my concern:

612
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:44,150
Take a look at this list.

613
00:34:44,152 --> 00:34:47,620
Most of 'em minor offenders,
mental patients.

614
00:34:47,622 --> 00:34:50,523
One stuck out: A2201.

615
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:52,092
It's Michael Myers.

616
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:55,628
Babysitter Murders, 1978.

617
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,899
40 years to this day.

618
00:34:58,901 --> 00:35:02,535
Michael Myers loose
with a bunch of nutbags

619
00:35:02,537 --> 00:35:05,072
in Haddonfield
on Halloween night?

620
00:35:05,074 --> 00:35:08,008
We're gonna have
a fucking circus on our hands.

621
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,044
But hey.

622
00:35:10,046 --> 00:35:12,146
What are we gonna do?

623
00:35:12,148 --> 00:35:14,081
Cancel Halloween?

624
00:35:15,685 --> 00:35:18,688
Dr. Ray,
please pick up line two.

625
00:35:33,837 --> 00:35:36,271
I need to go do a number two
almost immediately.

626
00:35:36,273 --> 00:35:39,776
- Can I drive?
- Come on, get in the car. Move it.

627
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,553
Want anything from the shop?

628
00:35:51,555 --> 00:35:53,191
No. No, thank you.

629
00:36:09,607 --> 00:36:11,142
Hmm.

630
00:36:12,877 --> 00:36:14,710
- Where's the loo?
- Excuse me?

631
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:16,012
Bathroom.

632
00:36:16,014 --> 00:36:18,149
It's out that way,
around the back.

633
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,441
Excuse me. Sorry.

634
00:37:48,443 --> 00:37:50,144
Someone's in here.

635
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,887
Hello?

636
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:47,069
What the...?

637
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:00,448
Help me!

638
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,917
Aah! Help me!

639
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:05,921
Aaron! Aaron!

640
00:39:10,294 --> 00:39:12,996
Aah! Get off me!

641
00:39:15,365 --> 00:39:19,334
Aaron! Stop!

642
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:21,338
Help me!

643
00:39:25,476 --> 00:39:26,942
Michael.

644
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:29,813
Aaron! Aaron!

645
00:39:46,231 --> 00:39:47,096
Dana!

646
00:39:47,098 --> 00:39:48,233
- No!
- No, please.

647
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,410
D-Dana!

648
00:40:01,547 --> 00:40:03,148
Aaron.

649
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,995
No! No...

650
00:40:52,332 --> 00:40:53,865
Police have not determined

651
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:55,367
a cause of this accident.

652
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,069
Uh, this scene's still
very active, of course.

653
00:40:58,071 --> 00:41:00,071
You can see the police tape
set up behind me.

654
00:41:00,073 --> 00:41:02,441
That prison bus
firmly down in that ditch.

655
00:41:02,443 --> 00:41:04,343
You can see the tow truck,
of course,

656
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:07,046
that is trying to get
that prison bus out.

657
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,947
A source tells us that bus

658
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:12,186
was transporting personnel
from a local state hospital.

659
00:41:16,324 --> 00:41:18,390
13 A-9.

660
00:41:21,195 --> 00:41:22,562
Roger.

661
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,152
Ray?

662
00:42:21,991 --> 00:42:23,993
Allyson?

663
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,232
Allyson? Is anyone home?

664
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:41,211
- Karen?
- Shh.

665
00:42:42,546 --> 00:42:44,148
What?

666
00:42:45,282 --> 00:42:47,115
- Gotcha!
- - Jesus.

667
00:42:47,117 --> 00:42:48,116
You're dead.

668
00:42:48,118 --> 00:42:49,451
You scared me!

669
00:42:49,453 --> 00:42:51,253
What are you doing
in our house?

670
00:42:51,255 --> 00:42:53,321
You mean, how did
I get into your house?

671
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:55,625
You have no
security system, Karen.

672
00:42:55,627 --> 00:42:57,459
Your side window was wide open.

673
00:42:57,461 --> 00:42:59,462
Sometimes I can't tell
the difference

674
00:42:59,464 --> 00:43:01,464
between your stupidity
and your ignorance.

675
00:43:01,466 --> 00:43:03,231
Hey, Laurie, this is my home,

676
00:43:03,233 --> 00:43:05,435
and I can take care
of my own family, all right?

677
00:43:05,437 --> 00:43:07,035
I know jujitsu.
I have studied...

678
00:43:07,037 --> 00:43:08,204
- The bus crashed.
- Ray.

679
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:09,605
- What?
- Look, I have a plan.

680
00:43:09,607 --> 00:43:12,074
Where's Allyson?
We need to get out of here now.

681
00:43:12,076 --> 00:43:14,177
What bus crashed?

682
00:43:14,179 --> 00:43:16,646
- Put down that gun. Put down...
- Hey, hey. Back off!

683
00:43:16,648 --> 00:43:19,081
Put down that gun. You're in
my... Put down the gun!

684
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,384
Mom, you need help,

685
00:43:21,386 --> 00:43:24,320
and you are not welcome
in this house until you get it.

686
00:43:24,322 --> 00:43:26,322
I have tried to protect you
and prepare you.

687
00:43:26,324 --> 00:43:28,024
Now we have to hunt him down.

688
00:43:28,026 --> 00:43:31,360
Yeah, and I am trying to
prepare dinner for my family.

689
00:43:31,362 --> 00:43:33,564
The world is not
a dark and evil place.

690
00:43:33,566 --> 00:43:35,699
It is full of love
and understanding,

691
00:43:35,701 --> 00:43:38,769
and I'm not letting your
psychotic rants confuse me

692
00:43:38,771 --> 00:43:40,337
or convince me otherwise.

693
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:43,073
- Keep the gun.
- No! You need to go.

694
00:43:43,075 --> 00:43:44,677
Get out!

695
00:43:53,185 --> 00:43:55,554
Son of a bitch.

696
00:44:07,834 --> 00:44:10,635
Hawkins.

697
00:44:10,637 --> 00:44:12,704
Frank!

698
00:44:12,706 --> 00:44:14,105
Yeah?

699
00:44:14,107 --> 00:44:16,243
Look at this.

700
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:20,311
- It's a hospital gown.
- State-issued.

701
00:44:20,313 --> 00:44:21,780
Get on the phone
to Smith's Grove.

702
00:44:21,782 --> 00:44:23,515
Confirm the match.

703
00:44:23,517 --> 00:44:26,117
You know I was there
that night. You know.

704
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:28,455
I was there.

705
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,390
We have one order of business.

706
00:44:32,392 --> 00:44:35,228
That's to hunt this thing down.

707
00:44:38,266 --> 00:44:42,167
There's a reason we're supposed
to be afraid of this night.

708
00:44:42,169 --> 00:44:44,537
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

709
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:56,181
Which one should we go to?

710
00:44:56,183 --> 00:44:57,216
They're all spooky.

711
00:44:57,218 --> 00:44:58,484
I'm gonna pick that one

712
00:44:58,486 --> 00:45:00,185
over, um, across the street.

713
00:45:00,187 --> 00:45:02,254
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

714
00:45:02,256 --> 00:45:04,891
- What the...? Sorry.
- Hey. Sorry about that.

715
00:45:06,461 --> 00:45:08,461
Black cats and goblins

716
00:45:08,463 --> 00:45:10,430
and broomsticks and ghosts,

717
00:45:10,432 --> 00:45:14,200
Covens of witches
with all of their hosts,

718
00:45:14,202 --> 00:45:16,469
You may think they scare me,

719
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:18,438
You're probably right,

720
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,242
Black cats and goblins
on Halloween night.

721
00:45:38,728 --> 00:45:39,894
Please!

722
00:45:39,896 --> 00:45:42,496
- Please let us out of here!
- Where did they come from?

723
00:46:04,655 --> 00:46:08,356
You are from the other side.

724
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:10,492
You are the sign.

725
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:41,860
- Trick or treat!
- Hey, guys. Stay together.

726
00:46:43,828 --> 00:46:45,530
Very scary.

727
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:50,299
- Mila. Mila, no!
- Trick or treat...

728
00:46:50,301 --> 00:46:51,801
- Wait your turn.
- ...smell my feet,

729
00:46:51,803 --> 00:46:53,803
- give me something good to eat.
- Wait, hang on, hang on.

730
00:46:53,805 --> 00:46:55,672
- I don't have my stethoscope.
- Come on!

731
00:46:55,674 --> 00:46:57,540
- I need it. I'm gonna get it.
- We're going to be late.

732
00:46:57,542 --> 00:46:59,544
- I'll be right back.
- Geez!

733
00:47:06,552 --> 00:47:08,786
Look. You're not
gonna believe this.

734
00:47:08,788 --> 00:47:10,788
They were in my pocket
the whole time.

735
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:12,423
Did Rebecca
give you directions?

736
00:47:12,425 --> 00:47:13,991
Yeah. She did call me.

737
00:47:23,703 --> 00:47:26,305
Hey, Sally. How are you?

738
00:47:27,673 --> 00:47:29,375
Really?

739
00:47:32,979 --> 00:47:34,915
That's awful.

740
00:47:36,717 --> 00:47:38,983
Well, I'll keep
my doors locked.

741
00:47:41,387 --> 00:47:43,490
Thanks for telling me.

742
00:47:45,392 --> 00:47:47,828
Billy's still out at a party.

743
00:47:50,297 --> 00:47:53,366
Let me know if you hear
anything else.

744
00:48:01,408 --> 00:48:03,410
Good night, Sally.

745
00:48:25,633 --> 00:48:27,500
Trick or treat!

746
00:48:27,502 --> 00:48:29,535
Bonnie and Clyde,
you are lady-killers.

747
00:48:29,537 --> 00:48:30,871
You guys are
seriously beautiful.

748
00:48:30,873 --> 00:48:32,505
You're seriously beautif...
Give me a smile.

749
00:48:32,507 --> 00:48:33,907
Give me a big smile.
Just hold her tight.

750
00:48:33,909 --> 00:48:36,542
There we go. Do that.
Do that with your ass.

751
00:48:59,601 --> 00:49:02,569
Okay, so, no, not...

752
00:49:02,571 --> 00:49:04,604
It's Vicky.
One second. One sec.

753
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:08,542
Okay, you don't...
you don't have to take it.

754
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,648
Hi. Oh, my gosh,
I wish that you were here.

755
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,049
It is so much fun.

756
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:17,718
God, I wish I was there.
I'm so fuckin' bummed.

757
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,554
It's just, like, so much easier

758
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:21,756
to actually, like, talk
to people when you have no idea

759
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,958
- who they are.
- Yeah, dude, I told you you'd have fun.

760
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,128
How's Cameron?
Is he looking super fine

761
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,829
in my grandma's skirt?

762
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,597
He is...

763
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,866
so sexy,
it's a little too much to take.

764
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:33,969
But...

765
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,438
- Where'd you go?
- No, he's so sweet.

766
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,941
- I'm having the best time.
- You know, you guys

767
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:40,242
should just come over here
when it's done.

768
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:42,978
Dave's already on his way,
and he's gonna bring the, uh,

769
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,447
you know, the "Alakazam,"
if you know what I mean.

770
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,416
And Julian's parents
aren't gonna be back

771
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:48,584
until, like, super late.

772
00:49:48,586 --> 00:49:50,118
Okay, well,
it is a school night,

773
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,654
so we're not gonna...
"kazam" too much.

774
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,690
Oh, come on.
It's a "school night."

775
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:56,959
Don't be a needy bitch.
Get over here.

776
00:49:56,961 --> 00:49:58,727
Okay. I'll see you soon.
We'll come over

777
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,030
- as soon as it's over.
- Okay, bye. Love you.

778
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:02,966
I heard you telling
your friends to come over here

779
00:50:02,968 --> 00:50:05,001
- and you're gonna smoke some weed.
- No. No.

780
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:07,003
- That "Alakazam"?
- Julian, I'm talking about,

781
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,905
like, uh, you know,
like, a ma-magic trick,

782
00:50:08,907 --> 00:50:10,807
- like, "abracadabra."
- I know you're talking

783
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:12,976
about smoking weed.
Don't lie to me.

784
00:50:12,978 --> 00:50:15,144
That's against the rules.
I'm telling my mom.

785
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:17,146
Well, I'm gonna tell your mom
about your browser history.

786
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:19,616
- You better not.
- You can get me in trouble,

787
00:50:19,618 --> 00:50:21,985
- I can get you in trouble.
- I'm...

788
00:50:21,987 --> 00:50:23,820
You used to be my favorite,
but now you're,

789
00:50:23,822 --> 00:50:25,788
like, my tenth favorite boy
that I nanny.

790
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,758
And I babysit
some fucking loser kids.

791
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,727
If I had some
other kind of babysitter,

792
00:50:30,729 --> 00:50:32,029
she'd be reading me a story.

793
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:35,632
I wouldn't be up
clipping my nasty-ass toenails.

794
00:50:35,634 --> 00:50:37,634
- Uh-huh. Go to bed.
- You used to be cool.

795
00:50:37,636 --> 00:50:40,037
We used to be friends.
But now...

796
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:42,773
Okay. Come on, go to bed.

797
00:50:42,775 --> 00:50:44,942
- Wait.
- It's way past your bedtime.

798
00:50:44,944 --> 00:50:46,577
- You want to be a good kid?
- Mm-hmm.

799
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:48,579
- Mm-hmm. Go to bed, go to bed.
- How much do you get paid?

800
00:50:48,581 --> 00:50:50,481
Come on, let's go, let's go.

801
00:50:50,483 --> 00:50:52,149
I'll get ya. Come on.

802
00:50:53,686 --> 00:50:56,187
Good night, little dude.

803
00:50:56,189 --> 00:50:57,855
Hey, Vicky.

804
00:50:57,857 --> 00:51:01,059
Can you leave the door open?
Just a crack?

805
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:03,161
Yeah.

806
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:04,864
Good night.

807
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:10,737
By the way, you're actually
my favorite kid I babysit for.

808
00:51:11,671 --> 00:51:13,672
I like you, too.

809
00:51:13,674 --> 00:51:15,206
Good night.

810
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,003
That is not what...

811
00:52:15,037 --> 00:52:17,871
Fuck. Okay, that really...

812
00:52:17,873 --> 00:52:20,173
that fucked me up. Okay.

813
00:52:23,245 --> 00:52:24,644
Allyson!

814
00:52:24,646 --> 00:52:26,980
Allyson, come here!

815
00:52:29,018 --> 00:52:30,951
- Wait. Hey, Allyson.
- No. What was that?

816
00:52:30,953 --> 00:52:32,819
- Okay, what? What? Hey, wh...
- What was that?

817
00:52:32,821 --> 00:52:34,888
- What?
- What's this?

818
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:37,291
What? Dude, have
some discretion, all right?

819
00:52:37,293 --> 00:52:39,927
I don't know what you
thought you saw, but, like,

820
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:43,097
I... Kim...
literally was talking to me.

821
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:44,999
- Really?
- She came up to me and, like,

822
00:52:45,001 --> 00:52:46,300
whispered in my ear, okay?

823
00:52:46,302 --> 00:52:47,769
You don't have to cry about it.

824
00:52:47,771 --> 00:52:49,270
It's not that big a deal.

825
00:52:49,272 --> 00:52:51,639
- So Oscar got you fucked up?
- No, I got...

826
00:52:51,641 --> 00:52:54,242
I mean,
I got me fucked up. I...

827
00:52:54,244 --> 00:52:56,210
Okay.

828
00:52:56,212 --> 00:52:58,913
- Hey, okay, can we just talk? Okay.
- Don't.

829
00:52:58,915 --> 00:53:00,915
Okay, here, you know what? No.

830
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:02,886
Your fucking precious phone?

831
00:53:07,724 --> 00:53:08,923
What the fuck?

832
00:53:08,925 --> 00:53:09,925
You gonna get that?

833
00:53:09,927 --> 00:53:11,193
Or you want me to get it?

834
00:53:21,172 --> 00:53:23,672
Hold... hold up, hold up.
Wait, wait, wait.

835
00:53:23,674 --> 00:53:25,040
I'm done.

836
00:53:27,912 --> 00:53:29,345
<i>This is Unit 14.</i>

837
00:53:29,347 --> 00:53:30,612
- <i>I'm out by Old Lady Miller's house.</i>
- Oh, shit.

838
00:53:30,614 --> 00:53:33,715
<i>I don't see anything
suspicious out here. Over.</i>

839
00:53:33,717 --> 00:53:36,086
Uh, ten-four.
You want to go ahead and, uh,

840
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,753
show yourself code two,
officially cancel

841
00:53:37,755 --> 00:53:38,821
request for assistance?

842
00:53:38,823 --> 00:53:41,690
Uh, affirmative. Over.

843
00:54:13,426 --> 00:54:15,159
Oh, shit.

844
00:54:15,161 --> 00:54:16,393
- Sorry.
- Hi.

845
00:54:16,395 --> 00:54:18,229
I didn't want to ring the
doorbell and wake up the kid.

846
00:54:18,231 --> 00:54:19,997
- It's okay.
- Check it out. Fresh from my patch.

847
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:21,398
- Oh, my God.
- His eyes are hearts.

848
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,766
- I love it.
- Yeah.

849
00:54:22,768 --> 00:54:23,901
- This is Tate.
- Hello. Hi, Tate.

850
00:54:23,903 --> 00:54:26,003
- Hello. What's up?
- Hi. How are ya?

851
00:54:26,005 --> 00:54:27,738
Do we have the whole house
to ourselves?

852
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,073
- Is that how this works?
- Yes.

853
00:54:29,075 --> 00:54:31,175
- Sweet.
- Until Allyson and Cameron get here.

854
00:54:31,177 --> 00:54:34,479
Okay, so, in the meantime,
you want to make some popcorn

855
00:54:34,481 --> 00:54:36,181
and watch a spooky movie?

856
00:54:36,183 --> 00:54:38,849
- Mm, no.
- All right, wait, check this out.

857
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:40,953
You're gonna like this.

858
00:54:42,256 --> 00:54:44,890
I went...

859
00:54:44,892 --> 00:54:46,958
and got this tattoo.

860
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,793
Because tonight is the night,

861
00:54:48,795 --> 00:54:51,229
the one we'll remember
for the rest of our lives.

862
00:54:51,231 --> 00:54:53,198
You are so getting
dry-fucked tonight.

863
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,902
- Oh, yeah?
- Fuckin' come here.

864
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,414
What?

865
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:11,417
- What was that?
- What was what?

866
00:55:11,419 --> 00:55:13,818
Did you hear something?

867
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,955
No. What was it?

868
00:55:15,957 --> 00:55:17,256
I don't know. I thought...

869
00:55:17,258 --> 00:55:19,325
I thought I heard, like,
a noise or something.

870
00:55:19,327 --> 00:55:22,528
Yeah, it's probably just Julian
taking a dump.

871
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,397
Would you go look?

872
00:55:24,399 --> 00:55:26,365
Do I have to?

873
00:55:26,367 --> 00:55:27,833
Yeah, would you please go look?

874
00:55:27,835 --> 00:55:30,169
Okay.

875
00:55:30,171 --> 00:55:32,838
- It was weird.
- All right.

876
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,311
All right, little buddy.

877
00:55:39,113 --> 00:55:41,348
- Oh, fuck me.
- I saw someone in the hallway,

878
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:42,782
standing outside my door.

879
00:55:42,784 --> 00:55:43,950
- Oh.
- What's up, buddy?

880
00:55:43,952 --> 00:55:46,852
There was a fucked-up face,
watching me from the dark.

881
00:55:46,854 --> 00:55:48,255
Ghosts and goblins,
little buddy?

882
00:55:48,257 --> 00:55:49,957
Shut up, Dave!
I heard him breathing,

883
00:55:49,959 --> 00:55:52,059
and then I saw him.
He's in here.

884
00:55:52,061 --> 00:55:53,227
Boogeyman's in this house.

885
00:55:53,229 --> 00:55:55,462
Okay. All right.
Come on, I got you.

886
00:55:55,464 --> 00:55:58,799
- Let's check it out.
- Send Dave first.

887
00:55:58,801 --> 00:56:00,468
- No, it's fine. It's fine.
- No, no. No, it's not.

888
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:02,236
- It's okay. Come on.
- No, it's not. No, it's not.

889
00:56:02,238 --> 00:56:03,371
Come on, show me
where you saw Boogeyman.

890
00:56:03,373 --> 00:56:04,606
- I'll protect you. I'm strong. I got you.
- No.

891
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:06,840
- No, Vicky, you go up there first.
- I'll fight him off.

892
00:56:06,842 --> 00:56:07,841
- Come on. I promise.
- No.

893
00:56:07,843 --> 00:56:10,345
- Can you call my mom?
- Yeah.

894
00:56:10,347 --> 00:56:12,113
If there's something
in the room, I'll call her.

895
00:56:12,115 --> 00:56:14,349
He was standing right there
in-in the door.

896
00:56:14,351 --> 00:56:16,453
I'll check it out.

897
00:56:25,161 --> 00:56:26,961
Excuse me, sir.

898
00:56:26,963 --> 00:56:29,130
What are you doing in here?

899
00:56:29,132 --> 00:56:31,866
Please, you need to leave.

900
00:56:31,868 --> 00:56:33,370
Please leave.

901
00:56:34,538 --> 00:56:36,137
Vicky?

902
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:38,108
Get out now!

903
00:56:40,844 --> 00:56:42,977
- Gotcha.
- You fucking kidding me?

904
00:56:42,979 --> 00:56:44,580
You're safe.

905
00:56:44,582 --> 00:56:46,015
Nothing's in here.

906
00:56:46,017 --> 00:56:48,883
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

907
00:56:48,885 --> 00:56:51,020
Y-You check
behind the curtains?

908
00:56:51,022 --> 00:56:53,055
I checked the whole place.

909
00:57:32,464 --> 00:57:34,397
Sick.

910
00:57:34,399 --> 00:57:36,333
See? There's nothing
to be afraid of.

911
00:57:36,335 --> 00:57:38,602
There's no Boogeyman in here.

912
00:57:38,604 --> 00:57:40,338
What if it's a doll?

913
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:43,607
Ooh, it could be, like, one of
those weird, like, kid dolls,

914
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:46,076
one of those weird babies,
and they stare at you

915
00:57:46,078 --> 00:57:48,446
with those beady little eyes.

916
00:58:02,028 --> 00:58:03,963
Oh, fuck, that was... Oh!

917
00:58:05,031 --> 00:58:07,200
Ah, sharia.

918
00:58:10,269 --> 00:58:13,438
Uh, c-could you close
the closet door?

919
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,209
Yeah.

920
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:31,590
Oh, shit!

921
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:33,992
Oh, God.

922
00:58:33,994 --> 00:58:35,360
No!

923
00:58:35,362 --> 00:58:37,162
Oh!

924
00:58:43,405 --> 00:58:45,671
Help! Dave!

925
00:58:45,673 --> 00:58:47,206
Help me!

926
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:50,309
Vicky!

927
00:58:50,311 --> 00:58:52,445
Whoa!

928
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:54,280
Julian, run!

929
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:57,116
- I'll go get help. Dave! Dave!
- Vicky?

930
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:59,419
Get out of here!

931
00:58:59,421 --> 00:59:03,122
Don't go up there!
You're gonna get killed, Dave.

932
00:59:03,124 --> 00:59:04,123
Somebody help me!

933
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:05,224
- Dave, help me!
- Vicky.

934
00:59:05,226 --> 00:59:06,727
No, no, no, no, no, no.

935
00:59:06,729 --> 00:59:08,462
No, no, no.

936
00:59:09,698 --> 00:59:12,566
No! No!

937
00:59:12,568 --> 00:59:14,066
Fuck this.

938
00:59:19,575 --> 00:59:21,508
All units, we have reports

939
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:23,343
of a domestic disturbance
at 707 Meridian Avenue.

940
00:59:23,345 --> 00:59:25,179
Please respond. Over.

941
00:59:25,181 --> 00:59:26,480
Copy that, Dispatch.

942
00:59:31,554 --> 00:59:34,154
Okay, guys,
don't forget to say thank you.

943
00:59:46,736 --> 00:59:49,304
Come on.
That's enough. No, come on.

944
00:59:49,306 --> 00:59:52,142
No, they can have
a little more, honey.

945
01:00:05,489 --> 01:00:09,357
Trick or treat, smell my feet,

946
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:12,295
give me something good to eat.

947
01:00:29,447 --> 01:00:32,648
Haddonfield
Sheriff's Department!

948
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:35,721
Responding
to a domestic disturbance!

949
01:00:44,395 --> 01:00:47,864
I repeat.
This is Officer Hawkins.

950
01:00:47,866 --> 01:00:49,701
Please respond.

951
01:01:06,786 --> 01:01:09,687
Honey, watch out!

952
01:01:09,689 --> 01:01:12,355
Get out of here! Now!

953
01:01:12,357 --> 01:01:13,791
Let's go, guys. Move.

954
01:01:13,793 --> 01:01:15,294
Get inside!

955
01:02:09,818 --> 01:02:10,883
Fuck!

956
01:02:30,739 --> 01:02:32,607
Michael!

957
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,355
Oh, shit.

958
01:03:10,279 --> 01:03:11,278
Laurie. Fuck!

959
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,280
Jesus Christ, Frank!

960
01:03:13,282 --> 01:03:14,816
- Fuck me!
- What the fuck?

961
01:03:17,386 --> 01:03:18,553
What the hell
are you doing here?

962
01:03:18,555 --> 01:03:20,855
Frank, he's here.

963
01:03:20,857 --> 01:03:22,457
I know.

964
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:36,038
This way, please.

965
01:03:45,549 --> 01:03:47,819
Look who's up.

966
01:03:49,453 --> 01:03:51,589
Where is he?

967
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:54,625
You tell me.

968
01:03:58,596 --> 01:04:01,464
<i>The bus lost control
after Michael</i>

969
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:03,466
overtook the first guard
and the driver.

970
01:04:03,468 --> 01:04:05,068
He's no longer dormant.

971
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:07,003
He only knows
how to keep moving

972
01:04:07,005 --> 01:04:08,604
and to keep killing.

973
01:04:08,606 --> 01:04:10,876
And he will kill again
unless he's captured.

974
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:14,745
Come with me for a minute.

975
01:04:14,747 --> 01:04:16,312
You sit still.

976
01:04:16,314 --> 01:04:17,848
Well, I was
sitting still anyway.

977
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:19,783
- What do you mean?
- He's an asset.

978
01:04:19,785 --> 01:04:21,718
He's not an asset.
He's a liability.

979
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,520
No, no. He's on this hunt.

980
01:04:23,522 --> 01:04:25,856
Nobody knows Myers
better than he does.

981
01:04:25,858 --> 01:04:28,492
- Oh, thank you.
- You want me to take

982
01:04:28,494 --> 01:04:30,026
this injured civilian
to go look for

983
01:04:30,028 --> 01:04:32,496
- a psychopathic serial killer?
- Sheriff.

984
01:04:32,498 --> 01:04:33,897
Frank. Wha-What are we doing?

985
01:04:33,899 --> 01:04:34,965
We don't need your help
right now, Laurie.

986
01:04:34,967 --> 01:04:38,335
You're just standing here!
Please do something!

987
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:39,538
Excuse me, officers.

988
01:04:40,472 --> 01:04:42,708
Laurie Strode.

989
01:04:46,545 --> 01:04:49,881
Laurie Strode,
meet Dr. Sartain.

990
01:04:49,883 --> 01:04:51,916
I'm Michael's doctor.

991
01:04:51,918 --> 01:04:53,518
Ranbir Sartain.

992
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,689
Oh, you're the new Loomis.

993
01:04:57,857 --> 01:05:00,827
I read everything
about you and Michael.

994
01:05:03,129 --> 01:05:04,998
Everything.

995
01:05:06,399 --> 01:05:08,599
Did you know
our friend Hawkins here

996
01:05:08,601 --> 01:05:10,735
was the first responding deputy

997
01:05:10,737 --> 01:05:14,006
when Michael
was apprehended in 1978?

998
01:05:14,008 --> 01:05:16,875
He stopped Loomis from
killing Michael that night.

999
01:05:16,877 --> 01:05:21,512
Do you know
that I pray every night

1000
01:05:21,514 --> 01:05:23,481
that he would escape?

1001
01:05:23,483 --> 01:05:26,018
What the hell
do you do that for?

1002
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:28,520
So I can kill him.

1003
01:05:28,522 --> 01:05:31,559
Well, that was a dumb thing
to pray for.

1004
01:05:37,865 --> 01:05:40,432
I'm sure he'll apologize.
He just needs to sleep it off.

1005
01:05:40,434 --> 01:05:42,902
Cameron doesn't want anyone
to see him as a bad guy,

1006
01:05:42,904 --> 01:05:46,005
but then he gets drunk
and gets belligerent

1007
01:05:46,007 --> 01:05:47,740
and looks like an idiot.

1008
01:05:47,742 --> 01:05:52,511
And then I look like
an idiot for vouching for him.

1009
01:05:52,513 --> 01:05:57,686
I'm really tired of everybody
letting me down all the time.

1010
01:05:59,487 --> 01:06:02,121
You deserve better.

1011
01:06:02,123 --> 01:06:03,957
I mean...

1012
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:05,859
Allyson, you're the
coolest, you're the prettiest,

1013
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:07,827
and you're the nicest girl
in school.

1014
01:06:07,829 --> 01:06:09,529
And if anyone
doesn't appreciate that,

1015
01:06:09,531 --> 01:06:11,999
they're a crazy person.

1016
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:13,433
Thank you.

1017
01:06:13,435 --> 01:06:15,570
That's very sweet.

1018
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,440
Let's get out of here.

1019
01:06:20,442 --> 01:06:22,475
I know a shortcut.

1020
01:06:22,477 --> 01:06:24,111
<i>From a clinical perspective,</i>

1021
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:26,480
Doctor, would you say
that Laurie Strode

1022
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,015
has lost her fucking marbles?

1023
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:30,184
There are many ways
for tragedy and violence

1024
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:31,986
to change a victim.

1025
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:35,589
They can grow accustomed
to always being afraid,

1026
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:37,758
in constant fear.

1027
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,828
They can grow weak,
they can grow strong.

1028
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,998
But there's also
the other side.

1029
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,498
What other side is that?

1030
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,800
The effect on the victimizer.

1031
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:49,738
You see, this is
what has intrigued me

1032
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:51,740
through my studies.

1033
01:06:51,742 --> 01:06:54,776
How does a crime
like Michael's affect him?

1034
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:58,713
Hmm? What's that feeling?

1035
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:02,183
Is he on a random path,
or is he emotionally driven?

1036
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:03,852
Triggered by something?

1037
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:06,521
Perhaps some
unheard marching order

1038
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,890
imprinted on his very being.

1039
01:07:08,892 --> 01:07:11,026
I want to know
what he's feeling.

1040
01:07:11,028 --> 01:07:14,629
I want to know what pleasure
he gets out of killing.

1041
01:07:14,631 --> 01:07:16,866
Where is this killer?
We gotta find him.

1042
01:07:16,868 --> 01:07:19,668
I'm not gonna stand in
the way of justice this time.

1043
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:21,670
Remember,
he's property of the state.

1044
01:07:21,672 --> 01:07:24,273
- He mustn't be harmed.
- Oh, yeah?

1045
01:07:24,275 --> 01:07:26,676
We'll see about that.

1046
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:57,710
It's not safe here.

1047
01:07:58,777 --> 01:08:00,277
Where's Allyson?

1048
01:08:00,279 --> 01:08:01,712
Where is she?

1049
01:08:01,714 --> 01:08:03,246
Where's Allyson?!

1050
01:08:03,248 --> 01:08:05,082
Honey, it's Mom.
Can you please call me back

1051
01:08:05,084 --> 01:08:06,717
the second that
you get this, please?

1052
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:08,118
The police said that
they evacuated the dance,

1053
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,987
and I can't get in touch
with you.

1054
01:08:09,989 --> 01:08:11,722
And they're making us go
to your grandmother's house

1055
01:08:11,724 --> 01:08:12,990
because it's safe...

1056
01:08:12,992 --> 01:08:14,992
Sweetheart,
this is your grandmother.

1057
01:08:14,994 --> 01:08:17,295
There is a police officer
waiting at your house

1058
01:08:17,297 --> 01:08:18,997
to bring you to us.

1059
01:08:18,999 --> 01:08:20,865
We're all gonna be together.

1060
01:08:20,867 --> 01:08:22,967
Now, do as I say.

1061
01:08:22,969 --> 01:08:25,036
Oh, shit.

1062
01:08:25,038 --> 01:08:26,603
It's treacherous as hell here.

1063
01:08:26,605 --> 01:08:27,872
- Okay.
- You good?

1064
01:08:27,874 --> 01:08:29,273
- Take my hand.
- Okay.

1065
01:08:29,275 --> 01:08:30,975
- Right here.
- This is the dumbest shortcut ever.

1066
01:08:30,977 --> 01:08:33,111
Watch out
for all the poison ivy.

1067
01:08:33,113 --> 01:08:34,946
- Don't let me fall on that.
- All right. I got you.

1068
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:36,714
- I got you. Okay, I got you.
- Okay, go.

1069
01:08:36,716 --> 01:08:38,283
- Oh!
- Okay.

1070
01:08:38,285 --> 01:08:39,284
You did it. Yay.

1071
01:08:39,286 --> 01:08:41,052
Good job.

1072
01:08:41,054 --> 01:08:42,254
Yay.

1073
01:08:42,256 --> 01:08:43,654
What are you doing?

1074
01:08:43,656 --> 01:08:45,757
I mean, you deserve better.

1075
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:47,759
- Right? I mean...
- No...

1076
01:08:47,761 --> 01:08:49,861
What the fuck?

1077
01:08:49,863 --> 01:08:51,030
I-I... What? You're not
with Cameron anymore.

1078
01:08:51,032 --> 01:08:53,032
That does not...

1079
01:08:53,034 --> 01:08:54,900
That does not mean
I want to be with you.

1080
01:08:54,902 --> 01:08:57,169
I thought... I thought
you were sending me signals.

1081
01:08:57,171 --> 01:08:59,671
- Definitely no signals.
- I'm so sorry.

1082
01:08:59,673 --> 01:09:01,106
Please, you cannot
tell Cameron about this.

1083
01:09:01,108 --> 01:09:03,008
I-I didn't feel anything,
either. I swear.

1084
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:05,044
- I didn't... Wait, I didn't...
- You are so pathetic.

1085
01:09:05,046 --> 01:09:08,781
I'm going home. You can
figure your own shit out.

1086
01:09:08,783 --> 01:09:10,682
Sh... Who's there?
Wha-What... Hey!

1087
01:09:10,684 --> 01:09:12,820
Motion sensor, dumb-ass!

1088
01:09:14,322 --> 01:09:16,056
Allyson, I'm, like,

1089
01:09:16,058 --> 01:09:18,291
really drunk right now.
Seriously.

1090
01:09:18,293 --> 01:09:20,859
I got really horny
at the party, and, like,

1091
01:09:20,861 --> 01:09:23,396
all these girls were,
like, dancing on me.

1092
01:09:23,398 --> 01:09:26,366
Their beautiful bodies got me
all chubbed out, Allyson.

1093
01:09:26,368 --> 01:09:27,967
I... Allyson, please!

1094
01:09:27,969 --> 01:09:30,270
They, like...
they were feeding me guacamole

1095
01:09:30,272 --> 01:09:33,273
in all these sexy ways.

1096
01:09:33,275 --> 01:09:35,010
It's not my...

1097
01:09:44,653 --> 01:09:47,088
Happy Halloween, Mr. Elrod.
I'm-I'm just...

1098
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:48,788
I don't know, man. I'm sorry.

1099
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:51,158
I'm not trying to trespass
on your yard and shit, man.

1100
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,160
I was just trying
to take a shortcut

1101
01:09:53,162 --> 01:09:55,229
with a really pretty girl,
and I just...

1102
01:09:55,231 --> 01:09:57,098
I just really like her, man,

1103
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,200
and I-I thought
that she liked me, too.

1104
01:09:59,202 --> 01:10:00,768
And I just... it just...

1105
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:02,403
Have you ever
really liked a girl

1106
01:10:02,405 --> 01:10:04,207
and you just couldn't have her?

1107
01:10:05,408 --> 01:10:07,074
I'm s... I'm sorry, man.

1108
01:10:07,076 --> 01:10:09,176
I'll just... I'll peace out
of your hair, man.

1109
01:10:09,178 --> 01:10:12,849
Thank-thank you for...

1110
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:21,990
Hey, uh...

1111
01:10:21,992 --> 01:10:23,858
where'd you go, man?
You're acting...

1112
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:25,759
Dude, you're acting, like,

1113
01:10:25,761 --> 01:10:27,865
really sketchy right now.
I don't...

1114
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:30,167
Uh...

1115
01:10:32,302 --> 01:10:34,336
What's up?

1116
01:10:36,707 --> 01:10:39,343
I'm-I'm-I'm leaving right...
I don't...

1117
01:10:40,411 --> 01:10:41,879
I'm...

1118
01:10:49,786 --> 01:10:53,356
Ow! Oh, my God! Aah! Aah!

1119
01:10:53,358 --> 01:10:54,423
Help me! Help!

1120
01:10:54,425 --> 01:10:55,757
Please! Somebody!

1121
01:10:55,759 --> 01:10:57,193
Somebody, help me, please!

1122
01:10:57,195 --> 01:10:58,895
Somebody, please!
Please, somebody!

1123
01:10:58,897 --> 01:11:00,796
Somebody, please help me!
Please!

1124
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,765
Please, somebody, help me! Aah!

1125
01:11:02,767 --> 01:11:05,034
- Aah! Anybody!
- Oscar, come on.

1126
01:11:05,036 --> 01:11:06,469
Please, dear God! Please!

1127
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,104
Plea... Please!

1128
01:11:08,106 --> 01:11:10,440
Help me! Help me! Help me!

1129
01:11:10,442 --> 01:11:12,041
Please help me!

1130
01:11:23,489 --> 01:11:25,790
Oscar!

1131
01:11:53,786 --> 01:11:56,454
Help! Let me in!

1132
01:11:56,456 --> 01:11:58,225
Let me in!

1133
01:12:01,528 --> 01:12:03,962
Help!

1134
01:12:03,964 --> 01:12:06,464
Somebody!

1135
01:12:06,466 --> 01:12:08,866
Help!

1136
01:12:08,868 --> 01:12:11,869
Help! Help!

1137
01:12:11,871 --> 01:12:13,472
Somebody!

1138
01:12:13,474 --> 01:12:15,507
Please!

1139
01:12:15,509 --> 01:12:17,108
Help!

1140
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:18,410
<i>'Cause my daughter
is not calling.</i>

1141
01:12:18,412 --> 01:12:19,744
<i>It's safer for you...</i>

1142
01:12:19,746 --> 01:12:20,812
- She's not texting.
- Come on, Karen, let's go inside.

1143
01:12:20,814 --> 01:12:21,913
Everyone's looking
for your daughter.

1144
01:12:21,915 --> 01:12:24,283
- Let them take care of it.
- So whoever you had

1145
01:12:24,285 --> 01:12:25,417
looking for her is obviously
not able to identify her.

1146
01:12:25,419 --> 01:12:26,652
- We're gonna find your daughter.
- It's Halloween.

1147
01:12:26,654 --> 01:12:27,453
- We're gonna bring her here.
- There are kids everywhere.

1148
01:12:27,455 --> 01:12:29,455
- Karen, come on.
- There is no way.

1149
01:12:29,457 --> 01:12:31,190
- Karen. Karen.
- She had a costume, you know?

1150
01:12:31,192 --> 01:12:33,259
- We need to go in the house.
- We have everybody available...

1151
01:12:33,261 --> 01:12:34,994
In the last 40 years, okay?

1152
01:12:34,996 --> 01:12:37,029
Honey, if you let 'em
do their job, they're gonna...

1153
01:12:37,031 --> 01:12:38,933
Karen!

1154
01:12:44,272 --> 01:12:47,108
Just breathe.
And if you want, we can call...

1155
01:12:51,145 --> 01:12:53,346
Stay in the car, Doctor.

1156
01:12:53,348 --> 01:12:55,148
- You all right?
- Take deep breaths, sweetheart.

1157
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:56,416
- He's... he's down the street.
- Okay.

1158
01:12:56,418 --> 01:12:58,618
- Okay.
- He's back. He killed my friend.

1159
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,154
Everything's gonna be
all right. It's okay.

1160
01:13:01,156 --> 01:13:02,522
Take a deep breath.

1161
01:13:02,524 --> 01:13:04,891
We're gonna take you back
to your mom, okay?

1162
01:13:04,893 --> 01:13:06,860
I'm a doctor. Lock your doors.

1163
01:13:06,862 --> 01:13:09,362
Everybody, get back to your
houses now and lock your doors.

1164
01:13:09,364 --> 01:13:11,164
We're gonna take you
to your mom.

1165
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:13,033
Don't worry about him.
Don't worry about him.

1166
01:13:13,035 --> 01:13:14,934
Back in your houses now!

1167
01:13:14,936 --> 01:13:16,437
You heard the officer.

1168
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:19,005
- What is going on?
- Back in your houses!

1169
01:13:19,007 --> 01:13:20,942
Lock your goddamn doors.

1170
01:13:42,599 --> 01:13:44,198
What's this?

1171
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,202
It's my childhood.

1172
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:51,240
Let's go.

1173
01:14:23,107 --> 01:14:25,042
All right, pick your poison.

1174
01:14:26,177 --> 01:14:29,514
I like a revolver.
They never jam.

1175
01:14:31,483 --> 01:14:34,319
This is accuracy
and stopping power.

1176
01:14:35,954 --> 01:14:37,653
This is tactical.

1177
01:14:37,655 --> 01:14:40,123
He waited for this night.

1178
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:42,125
He's waited for me.

1179
01:14:42,127 --> 01:14:43,528
I've waited for him.

1180
01:14:45,664 --> 01:14:47,631
Come on, Michael.

1181
01:14:56,342 --> 01:14:58,509
Allyson, keep your eyes open.

1182
01:14:58,511 --> 01:15:00,377
- He is out there somewhere.
- 601.

1183
01:15:00,379 --> 01:15:02,546
Suspect reported on 11th,
near Saint Park.

1184
01:15:02,548 --> 01:15:04,615
Copy that, Dispatch.

1185
01:15:04,617 --> 01:15:06,552
I got eyes.

1186
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,424
Look! It's him!

1187
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:15,294
Here we go.

1188
01:15:16,462 --> 01:15:17,564
Brace yourselves.

1189
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,031
Don't hit him!

1190
01:15:21,033 --> 01:15:22,636
- Watch out!
- Michael!

1191
01:15:29,676 --> 01:15:31,242
Don't shoot him.

1192
01:15:31,244 --> 01:15:34,214
- Doctor, get back in the car.
- No!

1193
01:15:35,148 --> 01:15:37,048
You killed him. He's dead.

1194
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:38,516
- Stand back.
- No.

1195
01:15:38,518 --> 01:15:40,652
I'm still gonna blow
this motherfucker's brains out.

1196
01:15:40,654 --> 01:15:42,320
Get away.
Leave my patient alone.

1197
01:15:42,322 --> 01:15:44,456
Get away
from the body. Stand back.

1198
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:47,160
I'm not gonna say it again.
Step away from the suspect.

1199
01:15:48,663 --> 01:15:49,662
Step a...

1200
01:15:56,737 --> 01:15:58,473
Fuck.

1201
01:16:07,048 --> 01:16:09,081
Help! Help!

1202
01:16:09,083 --> 01:16:10,316
Help!

1203
01:16:23,832 --> 01:16:26,833
So this is what it feels like.

1204
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:33,373
Help!

1205
01:17:15,318 --> 01:17:18,154
- Make room for my patient.
- No!

1206
01:17:19,556 --> 01:17:22,191
No.

1207
01:17:25,563 --> 01:17:27,663
No!

1208
01:17:37,141 --> 01:17:39,575
These people want
to kill this man

1209
01:17:39,577 --> 01:17:41,376
for the crimes you observed.

1210
01:17:41,378 --> 01:17:43,245
The most important opportunity

1211
01:17:43,247 --> 01:17:45,480
to understand the mind
of evil, you see.

1212
01:17:45,482 --> 01:17:48,218
So, when he awakes,
we'll be ready.

1213
01:17:49,253 --> 01:17:50,720
Ready for what?

1214
01:17:50,722 --> 01:17:52,589
The reunion.

1215
01:17:52,591 --> 01:17:55,457
Michael's pursuit
of Laurie Strode

1216
01:17:55,459 --> 01:17:57,860
could be what keeps him alive.

1217
01:17:57,862 --> 01:18:02,498
I would suspect
the notion of being a predator

1218
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:07,904
or the fear of becoming prey
keeps both of them alive.

1219
01:18:11,576 --> 01:18:13,276
You want a banh mi sandwich?

1220
01:18:13,278 --> 01:18:14,510
A what? What is that?

1221
01:18:14,512 --> 01:18:15,778
- A banh mi sandwich.
- What's a...

1222
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:17,680
Wh-What is that?
I don't even know what that is.

1223
01:18:17,682 --> 01:18:19,616
I love that about you, Francis.
You're so predictable.

1224
01:18:19,618 --> 01:18:21,885
You're like a PB and J
every day kind of guy.

1225
01:18:21,887 --> 01:18:23,252
Oh, here we go.

1226
01:18:23,254 --> 01:18:24,387
No, a banh mi sandwich.

1227
01:18:24,389 --> 01:18:25,723
Banh mi is essentially just

1228
01:18:25,725 --> 01:18:28,692
the Vietnamese version
of a French baguette.

1229
01:18:28,694 --> 01:18:31,428
- Mm-hmm.
- And the term actually refers

1230
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:34,598
to the bread and not so much
the contents therein.

1231
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,834
- Mm.
- But your partner,

1232
01:18:36,836 --> 01:18:38,836
- the greatest partner in the world...
- Oh.

1233
01:18:38,838 --> 01:18:41,405
...made an arrangement
with the Vietnamese folks

1234
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,640
- at the restaurant...
- Mm.

1235
01:18:42,642 --> 01:18:44,508
...and had them make you
your very own

1236
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:46,746
peanut butter and jelly
banh mi sandwich.

1237
01:18:48,381 --> 01:18:49,914
That sounds disgusting.

1238
01:18:49,916 --> 01:18:51,783
I'm not gonna try that.
I brought my own food.

1239
01:18:51,785 --> 01:18:53,517
- I'm very happy with my...
- What did you bring?

1240
01:18:53,519 --> 01:18:54,786
You want to see what I brought?

1241
01:18:54,788 --> 01:18:57,388
Yeah, I do want to see
what you brought.

1242
01:18:57,390 --> 01:18:58,623
Why don't you look at this?

1243
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:00,859
- Look at that.
- Oh.

1244
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:01,926
- Fresh brownie.
- Okay.

1245
01:19:01,928 --> 01:19:04,663
Chocolaty homemade brownie.
I made that myself.

1246
01:19:04,665 --> 01:19:06,564
That's-that's, like,
what a five-year-old would eat

1247
01:19:06,566 --> 01:19:08,500
if they could make
their own lunch.

1248
01:19:08,502 --> 01:19:10,802
I worked
with Michael for years,

1249
01:19:10,804 --> 01:19:13,605
but I've never seen him
in an uncontrolled environment.

1250
01:19:13,607 --> 01:19:15,908
I've never heard him speak,
you see.

1251
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:19,377
In spite of my encouragements,
he remains unresponsive.

1252
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:23,685
But tonight,
so many possibilities exist.

1253
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,920
He spoke to me.

1254
01:19:27,922 --> 01:19:29,555
- He spoke to you?
- Yeah.

1255
01:19:29,557 --> 01:19:32,290
Um, uh,
when he murdered my friend,

1256
01:19:32,292 --> 01:19:34,927
he saw me,
and-and he spoke to me.

1257
01:19:34,929 --> 01:19:36,295
What did he say?

1258
01:19:36,297 --> 01:19:37,763
- One word.
- What?

1259
01:19:37,765 --> 01:19:40,566
Let me go, and I will tell you
what he said.

1260
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:41,600
You must tell me.
I must know. You must tell me.

1261
01:19:41,602 --> 01:19:43,536
Let me go, and I'll tell you
what he said.

1262
01:19:43,538 --> 01:19:45,671
Just stop the car,
and I'll tell you what he said.

1263
01:19:52,313 --> 01:19:54,613
What is that?

1264
01:19:54,615 --> 01:19:56,683
That's weird, right?

1265
01:19:56,685 --> 01:19:57,951
Is that Hawkins?

1266
01:19:57,953 --> 01:19:59,753
I don't know.

1267
01:19:59,755 --> 01:20:01,488
What was the word?

1268
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:03,592
Was it the sister's name?

1269
01:20:06,028 --> 01:20:07,461
Judith?

1270
01:20:14,403 --> 01:20:16,472
- What was the word?
- Fuck.

1271
01:20:18,674 --> 01:20:19,606
Michael.

1272
01:20:26,015 --> 01:20:28,952
606 to 601.

1273
01:20:30,053 --> 01:20:32,053
Hawkins.

1274
01:20:32,055 --> 01:20:33,888
Answer the fucking radio,
burnout.

1275
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:36,357
Hawkins?

1276
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:39,093
606, 601.

1277
01:20:39,095 --> 01:20:42,096
Hawkins, please respond.

1278
01:20:42,098 --> 01:20:43,933
Hawkins.

1279
01:20:54,945 --> 01:20:57,748
- Let's go check it out.
- All right.

1280
01:21:07,424 --> 01:21:09,493
Say something.

1281
01:21:32,884 --> 01:21:33,983
Can you see him?

1282
01:21:33,985 --> 01:21:36,553
Hawkins, please respond.

1283
01:21:36,555 --> 01:21:39,825
Hawkins, please respond.

1284
01:21:40,759 --> 01:21:42,392
Let's go and check it out.

1285
01:21:42,394 --> 01:21:43,562
All right.

1286
01:21:57,043 --> 01:21:59,844
Dispatch, be advised,
we got a man down.

1287
01:21:59,846 --> 01:22:00,945
He's ten-seven.

1288
01:22:00,947 --> 01:22:03,049
No sign of 601.

1289
01:22:27,941 --> 01:22:29,808
Karen, the lights.

1290
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:31,609
What are you doing?

1291
01:22:31,611 --> 01:22:33,178
I thought you said
we were safer here.

1292
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:35,981
You never wanted to listen
when I spoke of that night.

1293
01:22:35,983 --> 01:22:36,982
And this is why.

1294
01:22:36,984 --> 01:22:40,485
I've been preparing for this
for a long time.

1295
01:22:40,487 --> 01:22:41,987
You want him to come here.

1296
01:22:41,989 --> 01:22:45,924
I'm so sorry, Karen.
I'm so sorry, baby.

1297
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:34,810
Any word?

1298
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:42,885
Hey, any word on Allyson?

1299
01:23:53,196 --> 01:23:54,962
Hey.

1300
01:23:54,964 --> 01:23:56,699
Guys.

1301
01:24:02,272 --> 01:24:04,138
Wha...?

1302
01:24:33,603 --> 01:24:34,872
Ray!

1303
01:24:44,215 --> 01:24:45,916
Karen!

1304
01:24:48,753 --> 01:24:50,721
Where's Ray?

1305
01:24:51,889 --> 01:24:54,126
Michael's here. Get downstairs.

1306
01:24:55,227 --> 01:24:57,195
Go, baby, go!

1307
01:25:50,083 --> 01:25:51,148
Mom!

1308
01:25:58,258 --> 01:25:59,226
Mom!

1309
01:26:56,985 --> 01:26:59,153
I was wrong to raise you
the way I did,

1310
01:26:59,155 --> 01:27:01,288
but at least I can protect you.

1311
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:04,024
Nothing will happen to you.

1312
01:27:04,026 --> 01:27:06,360
I know you thought
this was my cage.

1313
01:27:10,766 --> 01:27:12,900
I'm scared.

1314
01:27:54,077 --> 01:27:56,213
I have to finish this.

1315
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:01,849
Mom.

1316
01:28:01,851 --> 01:28:03,051
I love you.

1317
01:28:03,053 --> 01:28:04,886
I love you, baby.

1318
01:28:58,578 --> 01:29:00,879
Come out, Michael.

1319
01:34:01,489 --> 01:34:02,756
Mom.

1320
01:34:07,697 --> 01:34:09,195
Grandmother?

1321
01:34:13,502 --> 01:34:15,605
Grandmother?

1322
01:34:23,212 --> 01:34:24,345
Baby.

1323
01:34:24,347 --> 01:34:25,579
Mom.

1324
01:34:25,581 --> 01:34:26,881
He's coming. Come on.

1325
01:34:26,883 --> 01:34:29,350
- Shh. Come on. Come on.
- Where's Grandmother?

1326
01:34:34,457 --> 01:34:35,790
I couldn't...
I couldn't find you guys.

1327
01:34:35,792 --> 01:34:38,729
- Where is everybody?
- It's okay. It's okay.

1328
01:34:53,644 --> 01:34:55,744
- It's gonna be okay.
- I'm locked in a cage.

1329
01:34:55,746 --> 01:34:57,849
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

1330
01:35:04,554 --> 01:35:06,321
Everything's going to be okay.

1331
01:35:45,397 --> 01:35:46,630
Mom, I'm so sorry.

1332
01:35:46,632 --> 01:35:48,432
I tried to stop him
from coming here.

1333
01:36:03,449 --> 01:36:05,683
Okay. Okay.

1334
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:30,042
Stay back.

1335
01:36:37,084 --> 01:36:38,919
Get back! Get back, get back.

1336
01:36:41,021 --> 01:36:43,657
Oh, God.

1337
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:50,831
Stay back.

1338
01:36:58,974 --> 01:37:00,574
Mom?

1339
01:37:03,444 --> 01:37:05,344
Help us!

1340
01:37:05,346 --> 01:37:07,682
I can't do it.

1341
01:37:09,383 --> 01:37:12,621
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

1342
01:37:15,891 --> 01:37:17,824
Gotcha.

1343
01:37:22,831 --> 01:37:25,132
Happy Halloween, Michael.

1344
01:37:35,577 --> 01:37:37,410
Come on, Allyson!

1345
01:37:37,412 --> 01:37:39,146
- Come on, Allyson!
- Allyson, go!

1346
01:37:39,148 --> 01:37:40,515
Allyson, come on!

1347
01:37:42,084 --> 01:37:43,150
Go!

1348
01:37:43,152 --> 01:37:45,553
Karen, come on, baby.
Come on!

1349
01:37:47,089 --> 01:37:49,990
Oh, God!

1350
01:37:55,131 --> 01:37:56,530
I got you!

1351
01:37:57,533 --> 01:37:58,999
Allyson, run!

1352
01:37:59,001 --> 01:38:01,602
Go! Go now!

1353
01:38:01,604 --> 01:38:02,570
Come on, kick him!

1354
01:38:02,572 --> 01:38:06,440
- Allyson! Allyson, go!
- Go!

1355
01:38:10,413 --> 01:38:11,648
Now go!

1356
01:38:35,139 --> 01:38:38,074
Okay. It's not a cage, baby.

1357
01:38:40,078 --> 01:38:42,714
It's a trap.

1358
01:38:53,725 --> 01:38:54,893
Good-bye, Michael.

1359
01:39:52,953 --> 01:39:54,585
Oh, God, someone's coming.

1360
01:39:54,587 --> 01:39:55,954
Someone's coming.

1361
01:39:58,925 --> 01:40:00,225
- Hold her.
- I got her.

1362
01:40:00,227 --> 01:40:01,659
I got her. Go!

1363
01:40:01,661 --> 01:40:03,561
Go, baby, go!

1364
01:40:03,563 --> 01:40:05,099
Hey!

1365
01:40:07,969 --> 01:40:09,667
Help us.

1366
