<i>Like we discussed yesterday,</i>

2
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:05,783
<i>I really want you all to focus
on topic sentences more.</i>

3
00:01:05,818 --> 00:01:08,291
<i>Too many of you
are rushing into examples</i>

4
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:09,886
<i>in your body paragraphs.</i>

5
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:11,756
<i>It'd be good for everyone
to review</i>

6
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,692

I sent you</i>

7
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:15,232
<i>a few weeks ago.</i>

8
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:18,829
<i>I know these rules
can feel constraining.</i>

9
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:22,173
<i>But remember,
the point of this course</i>

10
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:26,342
<i>is to learn how to write
clearly and persuasively.</i>

11
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,675
<i>That's how you can effectively
communicate your ideas.</i>

12
00:01:32,377 --> 00:01:35,450
<i>Chris, I imagine that was
supposed to be a private chat</i>

13
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:38,288
<i>that you sent to the
whole class. Well done.</i>

14
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:42,490
<i>And, yes, the camera on
my laptop still doesn't work.</i>

15
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:44,192
<i>Believe me,
you're not missing much.</i>

16
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:47,330
<i>Oh, and for those of you who
still haven't given me paper three,</i>

17
00:01:47,365 --> 00:01:50,234
<i>I need it by Wednesday,
no exceptions.</i>

18
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:53,070
<i>And remember,</i>

19
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:55,410
<i>the more you revise
these essays, the better.</i>

20
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,868
<i>The more you change,</i>

21
00:01:57,903 --> 00:02:00,739
<i>chances are you'll express
your thoughts and ideas</i>

22
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:02,378
<i>more clearly and persuasively.</i>

23
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:04,347
<i>All right?</i>

24
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:33,475

Just use your key,
Open the door!

28
00:03:07,973 --> 00:03:09,907
Oh, my god.

an ambulance? I should call an am...

00:03:18,918 --> 00:03:20,302
Read this to me.
Do you have a phone?

32
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:21,369
My phone's dead, I need to...

33
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:22,887
Please just read it! Okay!

34
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:25,560
Okay.

I need to...
Just read any of it!

Look, do you have a phone?
My phone is dead.

I need to call an ambulance.

53
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:07,030
You need help.
I don't go to hospitals.

54
00:04:07,065 --> 00:04:10,000
I can't help you, I don't...
I don't go to hospitals.

55
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,005
I am sorry, um... You can go.

56
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,644
Thank you
for reading that to me.

57
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:23,915
Are you sure you're okay?

58
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:27,820
I'm sorry, who are you?

59
00:04:29,494 --> 00:04:30,999
Are you acquainted with
the gospel of Jesus Christ?

60
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:34,090
- What?
- I'm sharing Christ's message of love,

61
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,960
- And I'm showing people...
- Oh.

62
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:37,500
Think I should call my friend.

63
00:04:37,535 --> 00:04:40,603
She's a nurse,
she takes care of me.

64
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:43,408
Yeah. Yeah, I'll go.
Sorry to bother you.

65
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,493
Wait.

66
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:46,983
My phone fell under there,
can you...

67
00:04:50,614 --> 00:04:51,745
Yeah, sure.

68
00:05:02,692 --> 00:05:03,823
Here it is.

69
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,403
Hey, listen, I don't know
what's gonna happen

70
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,064
in the next few minutes.

71
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:16,803
If you don't mind, could you...

72
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:18,937
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

73
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,295
<i>It's Liz. I'm not around.
Leave a message.</i>

74
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:31,587
What was that thing
that you had me read to you?

75
00:05:33,118 --> 00:05:34,118
It's an essay.

76
00:05:34,988 --> 00:05:36,394
It's my job.

77
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:39,562
I teach online college courses.

78
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:41,117
But why did you have me
read it to you?

79
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:46,635
Because I thought I was dying.

80
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,868
And I wanted to hear it
one last time.

81
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:56,876
You should have called
an ambulance.

82
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:58,911
With no health insurance?

83
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:00,847
Being in debt
is better than being dead.

84
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,652
What's wrong with you?

85
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:05,687
Why is there a missionary here?

86
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:09,119
Someone left the door unlocked.

87
00:06:09,154 --> 00:06:10,791
I left after
you fell asleep earlier,

88
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,057
I must've forgotten.

89
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,863
Good thing, too.
If I hadn't, you might have...

90
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:18,227
Liz, I don't like it when you...

91
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:20,471
Okay, okay.
I just hate the thought

92
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,935
of you being sealed up in
this place when I'm not here.

93
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,330
Now shut up, I'm trying to...

94
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:35,849
What? Hush.

95
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:41,987
Tell me what you felt.

96
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:44,792
Pain, in my chest.

97
00:06:44,827 --> 00:06:45,925
Hard to breathe.

98
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:48,059
I couldn't intake air.

99
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:53,933
How are you sleeping?
I'm not, really.

100
00:06:57,202 --> 00:06:58,542
Lean forward.

101
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,749
You're wheezing.

102
00:07:07,784 --> 00:07:09,718
I always wheeze, Liz.

103
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:10,950
You're wheezing more.

104
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,853
Deep breath.

105
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:18,661
That hurt?

106
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:19,776
What was my blood pressure?

107
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:24,029
238 over 134.

108
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:31,542
Oh.

109
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:32,675
Yeah. "Oh."

110
00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:37,408
Hey, could you...

111
00:07:37,444 --> 00:07:39,804
I haven't been to the bathroom
all day, I'm ready to explode.

112
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,558
You need help in there?

113
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,187
No, I'm fine. Sorry.

114
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:25,596
What are you sorry about?

115
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:28,797
I'm sorry. I don't know.
Just sorry.

116
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:30,392
- I should go.
- Thank you.

117
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,230
You must be from new life.

118
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:35,100
You know Doug,
from the church council?

119
00:08:36,268 --> 00:08:38,004
Yeah, I think so?

120
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,335
I'm not entirely sure.

121
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,611
I'm sort of new here, so...

122
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:42,074
He's my dad.

123
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:46,276
Doug and Cindy adopted me
when I was a baby.

124
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:47,849
Oh, that's great.

125
00:08:47,884 --> 00:08:49,785
I've never seen you there
before, but,

126
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,083
again I'm sort of new, so...

127
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:53,657
- Fucking hate new life.
- Oh.

128
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:55,003
My dad forced me to go
when I was a kid.

129
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:58,959
It was awful, growing up with
all that "end times" bullshit.

130
00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:02,193
You're young.

131
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:04,404
Why the hell
would you want to believe

132
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:05,999
that the world is about to end?

133
00:09:07,365 --> 00:09:09,805
I believe that
when Christ returns,

134
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,070
it's gonna be beautiful.

135
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:15,976
Look, you can go.

136
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:19,309
I know Charlie appreciates
the help,

137
00:09:19,344 --> 00:09:21,982
but if you're here
to convert him...

138
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:23,214
Oh, we don't convert,

139
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:24,215
our message is a message of hope

140
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,251
- For people of all...
- People of all faiths.

141
00:09:27,286 --> 00:09:30,760
I know.
You're sweet. But...

142
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,964
Believe me, he doesn't want
to hear about new life.

143
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:40,198
Why?

144
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:41,870
Because it's caused him
a lot of pain.

145
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:43,906
How?

146
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:48,713
It killed his boyfriend.

147
00:09:54,412 --> 00:09:56,412
You're saying the church...

148
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:00,020
Killed Charlie's boyfriend, yes.

149
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:03,056
And I should add that new life

150
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:05,289
has caused me a lot of pain
in my life.

151
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:07,929
So, we don't need you
coming over here,

152
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:10,096
especially not now,
not this week.

153
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,000
Why?

154
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:14,969
Because he probably
won't be here next week.

155
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,268
Where's he going?

156
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:19,402
I'm sorry
you had to come over, Liz.

157
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:22,042
No, it's okay.

158
00:10:22,077 --> 00:10:24,946
I'm sorry that
I always think I'm dying.

159
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:28,114
Charlie, your blood pressure
is 238 over 134.

160
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:30,215
- I'm sorry.
- Go to the hospital.

161
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,019
- I'm sorry.
- Stop saying you're sorry.

162
00:10:32,054 --> 00:10:33,251
Go to the hospital.

163
00:10:34,353 --> 00:10:35,957
You have congestive
heart failure.

164
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:37,266
If you don't go to the hospital,

165
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,490
you'll be dead by the weekend.

166
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:41,963
You will die.

167
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:45,241
Well, then, I better get to work

168
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:46,847
because I have a lot
of essays this week.

169
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:48,299
God damn it!

170
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:51,742
I know. I'm sorry,
I'm an awful person. I know.

171
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:54,404
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:55,941 --> 00:10:58,155
Did you still want to hear about
Christ's message of love and salvation?

173
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,277
No, he does not!

174
00:10:59,312 --> 00:11:00,312
Okay. Okay.

175
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:02,149
I'll go.

176
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:05,249
I still don't understand

177
00:11:05,284 --> 00:11:06,922
why you had me read
that essay to you.

178
00:11:08,156 --> 00:11:09,760
It's a really good essay.

179
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:13,929
Goodbye.

180
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:18,802
Charlie, you have to go to the
hospital. This has gone way too far.

181
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:22,102
And rack up tens of thousands
of dollars in hospital bills

182
00:11:22,137 --> 00:11:24,467
I'll never be able
to pay back, ever.

183
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:26,403
This affects me... too,
you know?

184
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:30,507
You're my friend.

185
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:33,213
I know.

186
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:36,083
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:36,118 --> 00:11:37,262
You say you're sorry
one more time,

188
00:11:37,286 --> 00:11:39,449
I will shove a knife right
into you, I swear to god!

189
00:11:39,484 --> 00:11:41,825
Go ahead, what's it gonna do?

190
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,620
My internal organs
are two feet in, at least.

191
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:01,504
I've been telling you
this would happen.

192
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:02,846
I know.

193
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:07,411
Haven't I been telling you?
You have.

194
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:20,028
<i>A new gop presidential primary.</i>

195
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:21,763
<i>However, they say
absentee ballots</i>

196
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:24,274
<i>are the lowest they've seen in recent
history.</i> Newscaster 2:<i> That's not good.</i>

197
00:12:24,298 --> 00:12:26,375
<i>No, it's not.
Get out and vote tomorrow.</i>

198
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,432
<i>If you want to vote
in the republican primary.</i>

199
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:30,841
<i>Our current polls do show,
among Republicans,</i>

200
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,173
<i>30% favor trump...</i>
- Liz.

201
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,574
<i>Senator Ted Cruz,</i>

202
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,112
<i>17% would vote for
Florida senator Marco rubio,</i>

203
00:12:38,147 --> 00:12:40,950
<i>and 5% for Ohio governor
John kasich.</i>

204
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:42,251
Liz.

205
00:12:42,287 --> 00:12:43,364
<i>For someone else, if they could.</i>

206
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,922
<i>Below a percent
that just don't know.</i>

207
00:12:45,957 --> 00:12:47,535
<i>Meanwhile,
Vermont senator Bernie Sanders</i>

208
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,861
<i>is expected to win the gem
state on the Democratic side...</i>

209
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:51,762
Please.

210
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:20,287
Thank you.

211
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,379
Oh, I've seen this one,
it's good.

212
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:42,302
<i>In the first part
of his book, the author,</i>

213
00:14:44,273 --> 00:14:46,009
<i>calling himself ishmael,</i>

214
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:52,444
<i>is in a small seaside town</i>

215
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,381
<i>and he is</i>

216
00:14:57,451 --> 00:15:00,716
<i>sharing a bed with a man</i>

217
00:15:02,555 --> 00:15:04,060
<i>named queequeg.</i>

218
00:15:08,396 --> 00:15:11,397
<i>The author and queequeg
go to church,</i>

219
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,071
<i>and later,
they set out on a ship</i>

220
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:16,567
<i>captained by the pirate named</i>

221
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,405
<i>Ahab,</i>

222
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:24,410
<i>who is missing a leg,</i>

223
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:27,281
<i>and very much wants
to kill the whale</i>

224
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:31,351
<i>which is named Moby dick,</i>

225
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:33,584
<i>and which is white.</i>

226
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,456
<i>In the course of the book,</i>

227
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:40,096
<i>the pirate Ahab encounters
many hardships.</i>

228
00:15:41,264 --> 00:15:44,397
<i>His entire life is set around</i>

229
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:47,037
<i>trying to kill a certain whale.</i>

230
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,731
<i>I think this is sad</i>

231
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:53,142
<i>Because the whale
doesn't have any emotions.</i>

232
00:15:56,774 --> 00:15:58,015
<i>He's just</i>

233
00:15:59,381 --> 00:16:00,710
<i>a poor, big animal.</i>

234
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,684
<i>And I feel bad for Ahab as well</i>

235
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:16,231
<i>Because he thinks
that his life will be better</i>

236
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,399
<i>if he can just kill this whale.</i>

237
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:24,734
<i>But in reality,</i>

238
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:29,574
<i>It won't help him at all.</i>

239
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:34,117
<i>This book made me think</i>

240
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:36,317
<i>about my own life.</i>

241
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:42,290
<i>This book made me think
about my own life.</i>

242
00:16:45,394 --> 00:16:49,297
<i>This book made
me think about my own life.</i>

243
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:38,559
Does this mean
now I'm gonna get fat?

244
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:42,530
No, it doesn't.

245
00:20:43,665 --> 00:20:44,994
I was always big.

246
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:46,061
I just...

247
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:48,470
I let it get out of control.

248
00:20:53,444 --> 00:20:56,709
So, was your mom okay
with you coming over here?

249
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,810
I didn't tell her.

250
00:21:01,848 --> 00:21:03,320
It's really good to see you.

251
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:06,554
You look beautiful.

252
00:21:09,526 --> 00:21:10,723
So, how's school?

253
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,363
You're a senior, right?

254
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,793
You actually care?

255
00:21:14,828 --> 00:21:16,828
Well, of course I care.

256
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:18,533
I pester your mom
for information

257
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,848
as often as
she'll give it to me.

258
00:21:25,773 --> 00:21:26,773
Um...

259
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:30,776
So...

260
00:21:30,811 --> 00:21:33,383
Why are you...
I mean, don't you have school?

261
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:34,846
Got suspended this morning.

262
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,585
Oh.

263
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:38,588
Why?

264
00:21:38,623 --> 00:21:40,786
I posted something about
my stupid bitch lab partner

265
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:43,052
that the vice principal said
was "vaguely threatening."

266
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:47,958
You don't like school?

267
00:21:47,993 --> 00:21:49,465
Only idiots like high school.

268
00:21:50,864 --> 00:21:53,370
But you're on track
to graduate, right?

269
00:21:55,198 --> 00:21:56,538
Counselor says I might not.

270
00:21:58,102 --> 00:21:59,376
I'm not worried.

271
00:22:00,907 --> 00:22:01,907
I'm a smart person.

272
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,974
I never forget anything.

273
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:06,911
High school is just bullshit.

274
00:22:06,946 --> 00:22:08,814
But, Ellie, it's important.

275
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:09,893
If you don't graduate, then...

276
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:11,757
Are you actually trying
to parent me right now?

277
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,523
No, I'm... sorry.

278
00:22:14,822 --> 00:22:16,591
I just...

279
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,226
I just thought that maybe we could
spend some time with each other.

280
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:20,935
I'm not spending time with you.

281
00:22:21,697 --> 00:22:22,697
You're disgusting.

282
00:22:28,165 --> 00:22:30,033
Well, I'm a lot bigger
than I was

283
00:22:30,068 --> 00:22:31,145
since last time you saw me.

284
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:33,707
No, I'm not talking
about what you look like.

285
00:22:33,742 --> 00:22:35,662
You'd be disgusting
even if you weren't this fat.

286
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:38,844
You'd still be
that piece-of-shit dad

287
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,359
who walked out on me
when I was eight.

288
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:43,684
All because he wanted to fuck
one of his students.

289
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:44,751
Can I have one of these?

290
00:22:46,183 --> 00:22:47,183
Yeah.

291
00:22:50,825 --> 00:22:52,495
Look, it's...
It's been a long time.

292
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,991
I just thought that maybe

293
00:22:55,258 --> 00:22:56,730
we can get to know each other.

294
00:22:58,569 --> 00:22:59,809
I don't even know why I'm here.

295
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,670
I can pay you.

296
00:23:06,544 --> 00:23:08,203
You want to pay me
to spend time with you?

297
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:10,238
And I can help you
with your work.

298
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:12,009
It's what I do for my job.

299
00:23:13,782 --> 00:23:15,078
I can help you pass
your classes.

300
00:23:16,785 --> 00:23:18,818
- You teach online?
- Yes.

301
00:23:18,853 --> 00:23:20,622
Your students know
what you look like?

302
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:22,558
I keep the camera shut off.

303
00:23:22,593 --> 00:23:24,021
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

304
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:33,202
My counselor says that if I
show a lot of improvement

305
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,636
in one subject,

306
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:35,791
I might be able to graduate.

307
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:39,168
You can rewrite these essays
for English.

308
00:23:39,203 --> 00:23:40,741
They have to be
really good, though.

309
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:45,911
Well, look, um...

310
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:47,715
I don't know if I should
write them for you,

311
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,826
but I can work with you on them.

312
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:49,981
How much can you pay me?

313
00:23:51,116 --> 00:23:52,082
Everything I have.

314
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:54,491
All the money I have
in the bank. How much?

315
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:59,892
$120,000? Something
like that. I'd have to check.

316
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:02,895
I never go out.

317
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,063
All I pay for is food,
rent, Internet.

318
00:24:06,835 --> 00:24:08,538
And I work all the time.

319
00:24:09,904 --> 00:24:11,144
And you'd give all of it to me?

320
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,610
Not to my mom, to me?

321
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:17,239
Yes. Just...

322
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:19,813
Don't tell your mom,

323
00:24:20,244 --> 00:24:21,244
all right?

324
00:24:22,884 --> 00:24:26,787
And maybe you could do
some writing just for me.

325
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:28,888
Why?

326
00:24:28,923 --> 00:24:31,726
Because you're a smart person.

327
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,860
And I bet you'd make
a strong writer.

328
00:24:36,095 --> 00:24:37,798
Plus, I'm a teacher.
I want to make sure

329
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,668
you're getting something
out of this.

330
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,069
I don't even understand you.

331
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:57,246
Stand up and walk over to me.

332
00:24:58,722 --> 00:24:59,853
What?

333
00:24:59,888 --> 00:25:01,723
Come over here. Walk toward me.

334
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:07,091
No. No. Without this thing.

335
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,699
Stand up and walk over here.

336
00:25:13,132 --> 00:25:14,571
- Ellie, I can't really...
- Shut up!

337
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:17,640
Come over here.

338
00:26:21,068 --> 00:26:22,936
"Celebrate my soul.

339
00:26:24,071 --> 00:26:25,774
"Sell my soul."

340
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,711
Gambino's!

341
00:26:29,472 --> 00:26:30,779
Yeah, you can, um...

342
00:26:31,914 --> 00:26:33,342
I put a $20 in the mailbox.

343
00:26:34,818 --> 00:26:35,850
Sure.

344
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:41,922
You can just leave it on the...

345
00:26:41,957 --> 00:26:44,188
Yeah, I, uh... I remember.

346
00:26:46,324 --> 00:26:47,664
Everything okay in there?

347
00:26:52,297 --> 00:26:53,297
Yeah.

348
00:26:55,102 --> 00:26:56,134
You sure?

349
00:26:56,939 --> 00:26:57,939
Yeah.

350
00:26:58,809 --> 00:26:59,841
I'm fine.

351
00:27:02,274 --> 00:27:03,274
Thank you.

352
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,791
Breathe slowly.

353
00:27:50,157 --> 00:27:51,189
Relax.

354
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:55,490
It measures perspiration.
It's an indicator of stress.

355
00:27:55,525 --> 00:27:56,942
It's about establishing
a relationship

356
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,207
between your brain
and your body.

357
00:27:58,231 --> 00:27:59,769
If you know
how to make yourself calm,

358
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:00,946
then your blood pressure will...

359
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,036
Here.

360
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:05,071
I don't need a little machine
to tell me

361
00:28:05,106 --> 00:28:07,535
to take a few deep breaths
and stop sweating.

362
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,911
Well, apparently,
you fucking do.

363
00:28:09,946 --> 00:28:12,540
Take another deep breath.

364
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:16,346
Thank you.

365
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:26,290
We're just gonna try some
different methods, or whatever.

366
00:28:26,325 --> 00:28:29,931
If you refuse to go to
the hospital, then you'll...

367
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:32,131
I don't know.

368
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,404
Where'd this come from?

369
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:47,411
Hey.

370
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:51,855
Was she here?

371
00:28:55,057 --> 00:28:57,057
No, I don't like this.

372
00:28:57,092 --> 00:28:59,224
This isn't a good idea.

373
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:01,193
You know you're not supposed
to be around her.

374
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:03,833
Does her mom know about this?

375
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:05,263
I just wanted to see her.

376
00:29:05,298 --> 00:29:07,298
Mary has kept her from me
all this time.

377
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:10,004
Why do you suddenly need
to see her so bad, why now?

378
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,039
Liz.

379
00:29:18,212 --> 00:29:20,080
Why the hell do you have
her homework, anyway?

380
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:24,480
Look, I didn't plan for this.

381
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:26,218
She needs some help at school,

382
00:29:26,253 --> 00:29:28,583
so I'm gonna help her
with a few essays.

383
00:29:29,786 --> 00:29:31,861
You haven't seen her since
she was eight years old,

384
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,005
and you're gonna
reconnect with her

385
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:34,589
by doing her homework for her?

386
00:29:34,624 --> 00:29:36,129
- It's fine.
- It's not fine.

387
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:40,962
She shouldn't be around you
when you're like this.

388
00:29:42,104 --> 00:29:44,632
What if something happens,
what if you need help?

389
00:29:46,207 --> 00:29:47,371
Charlie, calm down.

390
00:29:48,374 --> 00:29:50,044
Hey. No.

391
00:29:52,576 --> 00:29:54,015
Okay. Forget it, then.

392
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:57,348
- I'm worried about her.
- Why?

393
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,550
Oh, you're spying on her now?

394
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,158
It doesn't look
like she has any friends.

395
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:10,361
I don't think this is...

396
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,335
Come on, a dead dog?

397
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,409
I'm worried that she's forgotten

398
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:27,279
what an amazing person she is.

399
00:30:32,517 --> 00:30:34,352
She's just a teenager.

400
00:30:34,387 --> 00:30:36,420
Everyone is insane
when they're a teenager.

401
00:30:36,455 --> 00:30:37,354
When I was her age,

402
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,126
when my dad
would really piss me off...

403
00:30:41,031 --> 00:30:43,271
I'm just lucky I didn't get
arrested, that's all I'll say.

404
00:30:46,531 --> 00:30:47,563
Point is,

405
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:52,073
bringing her over here
is a bad idea.

406
00:30:52,108 --> 00:30:54,148
You have enough to deal with
right now, you hear me?

407
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:57,276
Do not bring her
over here again.

408
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,146
Okay.

409
00:31:00,512 --> 00:31:01,512
Okay.

410
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:09,123
It's not like she's alone,
you know. She has her mom.

411
00:31:15,197 --> 00:31:17,527
Ugh, shit. I have to go soon.

412
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:21,201
I hate these night shifts.

413
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:25,271
It's just a steady parade
of dumb, drunk college kids.

414
00:31:27,605 --> 00:31:29,374
Did I tell you about this girl

415
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:31,376
from a few nights ago?

416
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:33,983
The puke was bright purple,
I swear.

417
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:37,482
I mean, what is that?

418
00:31:37,517 --> 00:31:40,352
Why can't these kids
just drink beer? You know.

419
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:44,059
Are you choking?

420
00:31:44,094 --> 00:31:46,292
Oh, god! Okay, lean on that arm.

421
00:31:47,064 --> 00:31:48,064
Lean on that arm!

422
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,395
Okay, I need
you to rock with me.

423
00:32:04,774 --> 00:32:06,411
I'm okay.

424
00:32:07,546 --> 00:32:11,350
I'm okay.

425
00:32:11,385 --> 00:32:14,023
God damn it, Charlie,
what is wrong with you?

426
00:32:14,993 --> 00:32:17,191
Chew your food
like a normal human being!

427
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,127
You could have just died
right in front of me!

428
00:32:19,162 --> 00:32:20,162
I'm sorry.

429
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,267
I'm sorry, Liz.

430
00:32:55,528 --> 00:32:56,528
It's okay.

431
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:22,751
I read through some of the posts

432
00:33:22,786 --> 00:33:25,721
in the class discussion forum
this morning.

433
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:28,262
In particular, a post

434
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:32,530
about crafting a good thesis,
and I quote,

435
00:33:32,565 --> 00:33:34,730
"just pick a sentence
from the reading

436
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:37,271
"and say, 'it's good, '
or some shit."

437
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,340
Listen, at this point
in the course,

438
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:43,409
I have given you all that I can,

439
00:33:43,444 --> 00:33:46,775
in terms of structure,
building a thesis,

440
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,414
paragraph organization.

441
00:33:49,615 --> 00:33:52,484
But if all of that isn't built

442
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:55,355
on your own original ideas
and truthful analysis,

443
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,686
it doesn't mean anything.

444
00:33:58,426 --> 00:34:00,624
Think about that
as you write and revise.

445
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:03,297
Think about the truth
of your argument.

446
00:34:04,762 --> 00:34:08,731
I know this may sound silly,
but it's important.

447
00:34:10,372 --> 00:34:12,801
Promise, it's important.

448
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:34,520
This is...

449
00:35:34,555 --> 00:35:37,193
You say that Walt Whitman
wrote<i> song for myself.</i>

450
00:35:37,525 --> 00:35:38,722
Yeah?

451
00:35:38,757 --> 00:35:40,493
It's called<i> song of myself.</i>

452
00:35:42,332 --> 00:35:43,364
My title's better.

453
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:46,533
Yeah.

454
00:35:47,568 --> 00:35:48,568
Well...

455
00:35:49,504 --> 00:35:50,544
Okay, I'll just change it.

456
00:35:52,342 --> 00:35:54,705
"The poem<i> song of myself</i>

457
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,707
"is in a book
called<i> leaves of grass.</i>

458
00:35:56,742 --> 00:35:58,412
"It was written by Walt Whitman

459
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,612
"and was published in 1855.

460
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:02,581
"He paid for the first
publication himself."

461
00:36:02,616 --> 00:36:05,617
You don't have to read it
out loud. Just rewrite it.

462
00:36:05,652 --> 00:36:07,685
You're supposed
to analyze the poem.

463
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,258
This is just a list of facts.

464
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,458
Yup. Thank you, Wikipedia.

465
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,562
You know, it's really
an amazing poem.

466
00:36:16,597 --> 00:36:20,368
Whitman uses the metaphor
of "I" not to refer to himself,

467
00:36:20,403 --> 00:36:23,965
but to explode
the very definition of self

468
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,473
in favor of a more
all-encompassing...

469
00:36:26,508 --> 00:36:27,804
I really, really don't care.

470
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,801
You know, I think you might
like it if you actually read it.

471
00:36:35,847 --> 00:36:38,485
You're just like my teachers.

472
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,883
You think just because I'm not
losing my shit over the poem,

473
00:36:40,918 --> 00:36:42,357
it's because I didn't read it.

474
00:36:42,392 --> 00:36:43,358
I did read it.

475
00:36:43,393 --> 00:36:46,020
It's overwritten, and dumb,
and repetitive.

476
00:36:46,055 --> 00:36:48,693
And even though he thinks
his metaphor of "I" is deep,

477
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:50,596
it's actually
just a bunch of bullshit.

478
00:36:50,631 --> 00:36:51,564
And, in reality,

479
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,831
he's just some worthless
19th century faggot.

480
00:36:57,374 --> 00:36:59,803
That's an interesting
perspective.

481
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:01,574
It would make
for an interesting essay.

482
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:07,041
Just write that thing about
exploding the definition of self.

483
00:37:07,076 --> 00:37:08,515
My English teacher will love it.

484
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:19,823
- So, how's your mom doing?
- Oh, my god.

485
00:37:21,563 --> 00:37:23,838
Look, if you're not gonna write
these essays for me, then...

486
00:37:23,862 --> 00:37:27,600
Ellie, I don't need you
here to write these essays for you.

487
00:37:27,635 --> 00:37:29,305
If you want to go, you can go.

488
00:37:30,638 --> 00:37:31,798
You can still have the money.

489
00:37:34,576 --> 00:37:36,156
I thought you wanted to
get to know me.

490
00:37:36,276 --> 00:37:36,906
I do,

491
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:38,545
but I don't want
to force you to be here.

492
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:41,449
It's up to you.

493
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,556
She's fine.

494
00:37:49,525 --> 00:37:50,623
Mom. I guess.

495
00:37:51,758 --> 00:37:54,022
- She happy?
- When she drinks.

496
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,565
You guys still live in that
duplex over on orchard?

497
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:00,987
You don't even know
where we live?

498
00:38:03,704 --> 00:38:04,715
You don't stay in touch
with mom?

499
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:08,377
Yeah, I check in with her
as often as she lets me.

500
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:10,052
She really only tells me
things about you.

501
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,073
Why?

502
00:38:12,108 --> 00:38:13,877
Because that's all
I want to know about.

503
00:38:20,149 --> 00:38:21,390
When I was 11,

504
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:22,787
we moved
to the other side of town,

505
00:38:23,658 --> 00:38:24,756
near the Walmart.

506
00:38:25,462 --> 00:38:26,462
Is your mother

507
00:38:27,563 --> 00:38:29,563
- with anyone right now?
- No.

508
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,126
Why, you interested?

509
00:38:32,161 --> 00:38:34,733
No, of course not.

510
00:38:42,644 --> 00:38:44,039
Why'd you gain all that weight?

511
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:45,340
I don't...

512
00:38:45,376 --> 00:38:47,696
If you're gonna interrogate
me, I'm gonna do the same thing.

513
00:38:50,047 --> 00:38:51,287
Why'd you gain all that weight?

514
00:38:55,591 --> 00:38:58,955
Someone close to me
passed away, and it...

515
00:38:59,793 --> 00:39:01,991
It had an effect on me.

516
00:39:02,026 --> 00:39:03,026
Your boyfriend.

517
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,864
- My partner.
- Your student.

518
00:39:06,899 --> 00:39:09,031
He wasn't that young.
It was a night school course.

519
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:10,106
Oh, I remember him.

520
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,749
You had him over for dinner once

521
00:39:12,773 --> 00:39:14,707
when mom was in Montana,
visiting grandma.

522
00:39:16,546 --> 00:39:17,644
You made steaks.

523
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,141
The good kind.

524
00:39:20,176 --> 00:39:23,111
Better meal than you
ever made for me or mom.

525
00:39:23,146 --> 00:39:25,652
I remember hearing you
two talk after I went to bed.

526
00:39:28,954 --> 00:39:30,723
How do you remember all that?

527
00:39:30,758 --> 00:39:33,022
I told you,
I never forget anything.

528
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:44,199
How did he die?

529
00:39:46,202 --> 00:39:48,510
I... I don't... I'm...

530
00:39:48,545 --> 00:39:50,809
I really don't want
to talk about that right now,

531
00:39:52,076 --> 00:39:53,581
if that's all right with you.

532
00:40:05,221 --> 00:40:06,693
I'll write these essays for you.

533
00:40:08,598 --> 00:40:11,764
I want you to do some writing,
just for me.

534
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,635
I hate writing essays.

535
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,230
Just think about the poem
for a while,

536
00:40:17,233 --> 00:40:18,233
and write something.

537
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,841
Be honest.

538
00:40:22,876 --> 00:40:24,942
Tell me what you really think.

539
00:40:24,977 --> 00:40:26,680
You want me to write
what I really think?

540
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:29,243
I'll be right back.

541
00:40:30,587 --> 00:40:32,620
Just write whatever you want.

542
00:41:34,112 --> 00:41:36,585
Are you okay?

543
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,257
Unless you're dying, there's
no way I'm going in there.

544
00:41:39,854 --> 00:41:42,085
Oh, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

545
00:42:06,914 --> 00:42:08,243
Hi.

546
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:09,816
I was looking for Charlie?

547
00:42:10,412 --> 00:42:11,653
He's in the bathroom.

548
00:42:12,315 --> 00:42:13,721
Oh, I can come back.

549
00:42:19,124 --> 00:42:20,959
Are you his friend, or...

550
00:42:20,994 --> 00:42:22,290
I'm his daughter.

551
00:42:22,325 --> 00:42:24,831
- Oh.
- Are you surprised?

552
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:26,933
Yeah, I guess.

553
00:42:26,969 --> 00:42:28,945
What's more surprising?
That a gay guy has a daughter,

554
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:30,606
or that someone
actually found his penis?

555
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,270
I'm kidding.

556
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:36,370
Jesus.

557
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:38,506
Um...

558
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:41,375
Charlie was interested in
hearing more about my church,

559
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,276
and I brought some literature...

560
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:44,983
- Are you mormon?
- No, I'm from new life.

561
00:42:45,018 --> 00:42:47,689
Oh. That end times cult thing.

562
00:42:47,724 --> 00:42:49,658
It's not a cult.

563
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:51,396
Tell you one thing
that I like about religion.

564
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,859
What I like about religion

565
00:42:52,894 --> 00:42:54,993
is that it assumes
that everyone is an idiot

566
00:42:55,028 --> 00:42:56,973
and that they're all incapable
of saving themselves.

567
00:42:56,997 --> 00:42:58,700
I think they got
something right with that.

568
00:42:58,735 --> 00:42:59,866
I don't think like that...

569
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:01,736
What I don't like about religion

570
00:43:01,771 --> 00:43:04,200
is that when people
accept Jesus or whatever,

571
00:43:04,235 --> 00:43:05,872
they suddenly think
that they're better

572
00:43:05,907 --> 00:43:06,984
than everyone else.

573
00:43:07,008 --> 00:43:09,172
By accepting the fact
that they're stupid sinners,

574
00:43:09,207 --> 00:43:12,406
somehow they've become better,
and they turn into assholes.

575
00:43:14,982 --> 00:43:16,223
I don't really know what to say.

576
00:43:16,247 --> 00:43:18,214
I have some pamphlets
that I think would...

577
00:43:18,249 --> 00:43:20,084
Why did you just do that?

578
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:21,789
Are you coming back tomorrow?

579
00:43:21,824 --> 00:43:23,219
- I'm not sure...
- Come back tomorrow.

580
00:43:23,254 --> 00:43:25,254
I'll be here
around the same time.

581
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:26,893
I'm sorry, what's happening?

582
00:43:29,293 --> 00:43:30,864
Oh!

583
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,833
Hi. I was just coming over

584
00:43:32,868 --> 00:43:34,043
to share these pamphlets
with you.

585
00:43:34,067 --> 00:43:35,427
You'll have those done
by tomorrow?

586
00:43:36,036 --> 00:43:37,036
Sure.

587
00:43:37,807 --> 00:43:39,136
Five-page minimum.

588
00:43:39,171 --> 00:43:40,401
It'll be good, I promise.

589
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:45,340
- I'm Ellie.
- Thomas.

590
00:43:54,285 --> 00:43:55,318
So...

591
00:43:55,353 --> 00:43:57,924
Christ's return has been
promised for centuries.

592
00:43:57,959 --> 00:43:59,332
But there are a lot
of clues in scripture

593
00:43:59,356 --> 00:44:00,522
that suggest it's imminent.

594
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,929
So, that means we don't
have time to deny the gospel,

595
00:44:02,964 --> 00:44:04,139
- We don't have...
- Do you really think...

596
00:44:04,163 --> 00:44:06,361
that the world's gonna end soon?

597
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:08,374
Well, the Bible says
that no one shall know the day

598
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:09,903
or the hour, but,

599
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,858
yeah, I think we're probably
living in end times.

600
00:44:12,534 --> 00:44:13,940
And that doesn't bother you?

601
00:44:13,975 --> 00:44:15,337
No. It's the idea

602
00:44:15,372 --> 00:44:18,010
that a better world is coming
to replace this one.

603
00:44:18,045 --> 00:44:20,408
That everything terrible
about this country,

604
00:44:20,443 --> 00:44:22,278
this planet,
is gonna be wiped clean,

605
00:44:22,313 --> 00:44:25,182
and replaced with something
pure and holy, and...

606
00:44:25,217 --> 00:44:27,118
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be rude,

607
00:44:27,153 --> 00:44:29,021
but I know all this.

608
00:44:29,826 --> 00:44:31,089
What do you mean?

609
00:44:31,124 --> 00:44:33,355
I have probably read everything

610
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,325
new life church
has ever written.

611
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,361
Probably every pamphlet
they've ever published.

612
00:44:39,396 --> 00:44:41,869
Wow, that's great
and everything,

613
00:44:41,904 --> 00:44:43,658
but these tracts
are just the beginning.

614
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:44,932
There's so much more in the Bible

615
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,416
- That we can...
- I read the Bible.

616
00:44:47,107 --> 00:44:48,436
Really?

617
00:44:48,471 --> 00:44:50,405
Sure. Couple times.

618
00:44:51,947 --> 00:44:53,408
Did you like it?

619
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:55,949
I thought it was devastating.

620
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,820
God creates us,
expels us from paradise.

621
00:44:58,855 --> 00:45:01,823
We wander around for thousands
of years killing each other,

622
00:45:01,858 --> 00:45:04,859
before he comes back
and saves 144,000 of us.

623
00:45:04,894 --> 00:45:08,093
Meanwhile, seven- and-a-half
billion of us fall into hell.

624
00:45:10,394 --> 00:45:12,427
Yeah.

625
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:14,429
That's not really
how I interpret it, but...

626
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:17,872
Charlie, you have to understand,

627
00:45:18,941 --> 00:45:21,337
god hasn't turned
his back on you.

628
00:45:21,372 --> 00:45:24,208
If you accept him,
he'll release you from this.

629
00:45:24,243 --> 00:45:25,572
He'll take your soul

630
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:27,948
out of this body and give
you a brand-new body.

631
00:45:27,983 --> 00:45:30,115
One made of pure light.
I mean, don't you want that?

632
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:33,217
I'm not interested
in being saved.

633
00:45:33,252 --> 00:45:34,889
I appreciate what you did

634
00:45:34,924 --> 00:45:37,056
the other day, but you can go.

635
00:45:37,091 --> 00:45:38,596
This doesn't sound
like something that I...

636
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,357
Look, I really think that god
brought me here for a reason.

637
00:45:41,392 --> 00:45:43,359
There's a reason
why I knocked on your door

638
00:45:43,394 --> 00:45:45,394
right when you needed
someone the most.

639
00:45:45,429 --> 00:45:48,430
Isn't there any way I can help?

640
00:45:48,465 --> 00:45:49,576
I mean, that's the entire reason

641
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,609
why I became a missionary
in the first place, right?

642
00:45:51,633 --> 00:45:53,270
There's something
you can do for me.

643
00:45:57,507 --> 00:46:00,508
- What?
- Um, nothing I just...

644
00:46:00,543 --> 00:46:04,919
I hope you know
I wasn't talking about, um...

645
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,598
- What?
- I'm not...

646
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:09,642
- Oh, my god.
- I'm... I'm sorry. I just...

647
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,008
- No.
- With what you were watching

648
00:46:11,032 --> 00:46:12,102
the first time
I came in here, I just...

649
00:46:12,126 --> 00:46:14,225
I am not attracted to you.

650
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:17,459
Please, you gotta believe me
when I say I'm not attracted to you.

651
00:46:17,494 --> 00:46:18,526
You're a fetus.

652
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:22,530
I'm sorry.

653
00:46:29,374 --> 00:46:31,374
Thomas, tell me the truth.

654
00:46:34,379 --> 00:46:35,477
You find me disgusting?

655
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:39,922
No.

656
00:46:42,486 --> 00:46:43,617
I just want to help.

657
00:46:44,653 --> 00:46:46,554
Please, just let me help.

658
00:46:58,337 --> 00:47:00,403
Thank you. That's very helpful.

659
00:47:07,346 --> 00:47:09,951
What happened to your...
Sorry. Your friend, Liz,

660
00:47:09,986 --> 00:47:12,415
she said that your boyfriend,

661
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,351
he used to go to new life?

662
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,190
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

663
00:47:19,061 --> 00:47:21,028
I got you this.

664
00:47:21,063 --> 00:47:22,524
I did some asking around, and...

665
00:47:24,726 --> 00:47:26,528
What the fuck is he doing here?

666
00:47:26,563 --> 00:47:28,266
He's just helping me
with something.

667
00:47:28,301 --> 00:47:29,630
Take it easy, Liz.

668
00:47:29,665 --> 00:47:32,039
Okay, well, you can go now.

669
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:33,470
Liz.

670
00:47:34,637 --> 00:47:35,637
Go home!

671
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,441
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Leave it.

672
00:47:38,476 --> 00:47:40,476
I said, leave it!

673
00:47:40,511 --> 00:47:42,445
Liz, would you stop?

674
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:47,516
Actually, stay.
We'll have a little chat.

675
00:47:51,555 --> 00:47:52,555
What's this?

676
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,128
The fuck does it look like?

677
00:47:57,561 --> 00:47:59,561
It's a fat-guy wheelchair.

678
00:47:59,596 --> 00:48:01,563
And why do I need a wheelchair?

679
00:48:01,598 --> 00:48:04,698
I was talking to one
of the ER doctors,

680
00:48:04,733 --> 00:48:08,042
he said moderate activity
would be a good idea.

681
00:48:08,077 --> 00:48:09,648
Sense of independence
might help you out.

682
00:48:09,672 --> 00:48:10,849
And what did you pay
for this thing?

683
00:48:10,873 --> 00:48:13,278
Nothing. We ordered it for
a patient a few months ago.

684
00:48:13,313 --> 00:48:14,422
It's just been sitting around.

685
00:48:14,446 --> 00:48:15,606
What happened to the patient?

686
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,053
Just try it out.

687
00:48:19,088 --> 00:48:20,088
Please.

688
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:33,727
Beep. Beep. Beep.

689
00:48:39,603 --> 00:48:41,207
- Can I sit?
- I got you.

690
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:51,448
- Good?
- Yeah, actually, this is really nice.

691
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:55,353
Yeah.

692
00:48:55,388 --> 00:48:57,091
Let me clear some space for you.

693
00:48:57,654 --> 00:48:58,654
Whee.

694
00:49:00,261 --> 00:49:01,261
Hello?

695
00:49:06,399 --> 00:49:07,530
Look, no hands.

696
00:49:09,501 --> 00:49:11,435
Thank you, Liz.
This is great, so great.

697
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:14,669
- See? I told you.
- I know.

698
00:49:14,704 --> 00:49:16,440
- I should go.
- Ah-pap-pap.

699
00:49:16,475 --> 00:49:17,795
Not until we have
our little chat.

700
00:49:19,148 --> 00:49:20,675
- What?
- Come on.

701
00:49:27,387 --> 00:49:28,518
Liz.

702
00:49:28,553 --> 00:49:30,157
Just gimme a minute with him.

703
00:49:57,681 --> 00:49:58,681
Where are you from?

704
00:50:00,189 --> 00:50:01,222
What?

705
00:50:01,257 --> 00:50:03,217
You said you've only been here
for a little while.

706
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,755
Where you from?

707
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:11,132
Uh, Iowa.
A town called Waterloo?

708
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:12,793
You asking me?

709
00:50:13,697 --> 00:50:15,169
No. I'm from Waterloo.

710
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,204
Okay.

711
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:19,305
Your whole family
move out here for new life?

712
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:21,769
No, it's just me.

713
00:50:21,804 --> 00:50:24,310
I wanted to do some
missionary work before school.

714
00:50:25,742 --> 00:50:28,149
You're from Iowa,

715
00:50:28,184 --> 00:50:31,449
and you came to Idaho
to do missionary work?

716
00:50:31,484 --> 00:50:33,319
Why aren't you
in Africa or something?

717
00:50:33,354 --> 00:50:35,156
Idaho needs the word
as much as anywhere else.

718
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:43,824
Okay, listen.

719
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:45,463
I know this is fun for you.

720
00:50:45,498 --> 00:50:46,662
You get to travel around,

721
00:50:46,697 --> 00:50:48,301
act superior than everyone else,

722
00:50:49,436 --> 00:50:50,732
and eventually, you go home,

723
00:50:50,767 --> 00:50:52,866
get some boring job,
have too many kids.

724
00:50:52,901 --> 00:50:53,733
It's god's plan.

725
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:57,145
But there are
other types of people.

726
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,410
People like Charlie,

727
00:50:58,445 --> 00:51:01,644
for whom this amazing plan
doesn't fit.

728
00:51:02,713 --> 00:51:05,846
So, just stay away from him.

729
00:51:05,881 --> 00:51:07,320
He doesn't need this right now.

730
00:51:09,654 --> 00:51:11,390
I disagree.

731
00:51:11,425 --> 00:51:14,162
- Excuse me?
- Sorry, I just, uh...

732
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:15,559
He's dying.

733
00:51:15,594 --> 00:51:17,198
He's refusing
to go to the hospital.

734
00:51:17,233 --> 00:51:18,760
What he needs
is spiritual guidance.

735
00:51:18,795 --> 00:51:20,267
And you're gonna give him that?

736
00:51:20,302 --> 00:51:22,302
No. God will.

737
00:51:24,933 --> 00:51:26,141
I see.

738
00:51:45,261 --> 00:51:47,360
My big brother did some
missionary work for new life.

739
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:50,660
Went to South America.

740
00:51:51,465 --> 00:51:53,630
- Oh.
- Yeah.

741
00:51:53,665 --> 00:51:54,631
I was the black sheep.

742
00:51:54,666 --> 00:51:57,271
I refused to go to church
ever since I was 12.

743
00:51:58,307 --> 00:51:59,702
Dad knew I was a lost cause,

744
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:06,247
but not my brother,
he loved new life.

745
00:52:06,282 --> 00:52:08,348
He wrote me a letter
a few months after he left,

746
00:52:08,383 --> 00:52:10,482
told me he was tired,

747
00:52:10,517 --> 00:52:11,956
and lonely, but he didn't
want to come home

748
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,460
because he didn't want
to get married.

749
00:52:14,455 --> 00:52:15,630
He didn't want to get married?

750
00:52:15,654 --> 00:52:17,423
Dad had set it all up.

751
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:18,424
Pushed him into getting married

752
00:52:18,459 --> 00:52:21,823
to this girl from the church
he barely knew.

753
00:52:21,858 --> 00:52:24,397
But when he came back,
he met someone else.

754
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,432
Fell in love,
started a whole new life.

755
00:52:26,467 --> 00:52:29,501
And dad kicked him out
of the church.

756
00:52:30,405 --> 00:52:31,437
And the family.

757
00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:34,539
I thought he was gonna be able

758
00:52:34,574 --> 00:52:36,607
to get over
all that religious stuff,

759
00:52:36,642 --> 00:52:39,907
but it was like a cancer.

760
00:52:39,942 --> 00:52:42,481
He couldn't shake it.

761
00:52:42,516 --> 00:52:44,318
He just caved in on himself,

762
00:52:44,353 --> 00:52:45,781
stopped sleeping,
stopped eating.

763
00:52:45,816 --> 00:52:46,947
Lost a ton of weight.

764
00:52:48,654 --> 00:52:50,522
One night, he doesn't come home.

765
00:52:52,658 --> 00:52:54,559
Couple weeks later,
this guy is out jogging

766
00:52:54,594 --> 00:52:56,396
on a bike path
near the river in lewiston,

767
00:52:56,431 --> 00:52:57,991
sees something washed up
on shore,

768
00:52:58,026 --> 00:52:59,828
and that was Alan.

769
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:04,470
The love of Charlie's life,
and my brother.

770
00:53:05,968 --> 00:53:08,408
- Oh.
- Yeah. "Oh."

771
00:53:08,443 --> 00:53:10,938
To this day,
my dad won't admit it.

772
00:53:10,973 --> 00:53:13,479
Told the whole congregation
Alan's death was...

773
00:53:15,417 --> 00:53:17,450
Just an unfortunate accident.

774
00:53:20,081 --> 00:53:22,851
Denying him to the end.

775
00:53:31,862 --> 00:53:34,830
Look, I know
that you don't trust me.

776
00:53:34,865 --> 00:53:37,503
And I know that I haven't
known him for very long,

777
00:53:37,538 --> 00:53:40,473
but I really think
that god brought me here,

778
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,462
right when Charlie
needs it the most.

779
00:53:42,486 --> 00:53:44,066
I just want him to be saved,
that's all...

780
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:45,347
You listen to me!

781
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:46,908
He doesn't need saving!

782
00:53:48,076 --> 00:53:50,582
In a few days, he's probably
going to be dead,

783
00:53:50,617 --> 00:53:53,046
so what he needs
is for you to leave him alone.

784
00:53:53,081 --> 00:53:54,718
I'm the only one
who can help him.

785
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:56,049
- You understand me?
- Liz.

786
00:54:24,112 --> 00:54:26,981
You wanna watch some<i> Maury?</i>

787
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,984
Sounds good, right?

788
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,099
Actually, I got
another night shift tonight.

789
00:54:35,123 --> 00:54:36,727
I better, uh...

790
00:54:36,762 --> 00:54:37,762
You good for the night?

791
00:54:39,765 --> 00:54:42,062
I'll leave the remote here.

792
00:56:13,529 --> 00:56:14,924
Gambino's!

793
00:56:14,959 --> 00:56:16,959
Yeah. You can, uh...

794
00:56:16,994 --> 00:56:19,192
Money in the mailbox,
leave it on the bench.

795
00:56:20,503 --> 00:56:21,799
Yeah. Thanks.

796
00:56:23,869 --> 00:56:24,869
I'm Dan.

797
00:56:27,609 --> 00:56:28,806
What?

798
00:56:28,841 --> 00:56:31,776
I just... My name, it's Dan.

799
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:36,143
I've been coming here
for a while now.

800
00:56:36,178 --> 00:56:38,178
Just thought you'd wanna know
my name.

801
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:41,852
Charlie.

802
00:56:43,152 --> 00:56:44,657
Hey, Charlie.

803
00:56:47,024 --> 00:56:48,221
Have a good night, okay?

804
00:56:56,836 --> 00:56:58,069
<i>It sure did.</i>

805
00:56:58,104 --> 00:57:00,640
<i>More Idaho Republicans
want to see senator Ted Cruz</i>

806
00:57:00,675 --> 00:57:02,576
<i>in the white house
than any other candidate.</i>

807
00:57:02,611 --> 00:57:05,546
<i>Cruz will split
Idaho's 32 delegates</i>

808
00:57:05,581 --> 00:57:06,881
<i>with Donald Trump,</i>

809
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:10,144
<i>the only other candidate
to clear that 20% threshold.</i>

810
00:57:10,179 --> 00:57:13,213
<i>It was a disappointing night
for senator Marco rubio</i>

811
00:57:13,248 --> 00:57:15,116
<i>who failed to win any delegates</i>

812
00:57:15,151 --> 00:57:17,855
<i>in the four states that held
primaries, while...</i>

813
00:57:45,016 --> 00:57:46,851
"This apartment smells.

814
00:57:46,886 --> 00:57:50,921
"This notebook is retarded.
I hate everyone."

815
00:58:00,163 --> 00:58:02,999
This apartment smells.

816
00:58:03,034 --> 00:58:07,135
This notebook is retarded.

817
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:10,105
I hate everyone.

818
00:58:23,692 --> 00:58:25,285
And I felt saddest of all

819
00:58:26,321 --> 00:58:28,189
when I read the boring chapters

820
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:31,599
that were only descriptions
of whales

821
00:58:32,393 --> 00:58:34,063
because I knew

822
00:58:35,869 --> 00:58:38,672
that the author
was just trying to save us

823
00:58:38,707 --> 00:58:40,201
from his own sad story,

824
00:58:41,402 --> 00:58:42,841
just for a little while.

825
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,615
This apartment smells.

826
00:58:49,949 --> 00:58:52,180
This apartment smells.

827
00:58:55,218 --> 00:58:56,954
The author
was just trying to save us

828
00:58:56,989 --> 00:58:58,219
from his own sad story.

829
00:58:59,893 --> 00:59:01,057
I hate everyone.

830
00:59:05,393 --> 00:59:06,601
I hate everyone.

831
00:59:12,334 --> 00:59:13,334
Do you have it?

832
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:15,302
I'm almost done.

833
00:59:17,779 --> 00:59:20,747
You can wait
while I finish it up,

834
00:59:23,213 --> 00:59:24,245
print it out.

835
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:29,085
Maybe while you're waiting,

836
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,589
you can write some more in
your notebook.

837
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:31,943
Oh, my god.

838
00:59:32,024 --> 00:59:34,189
You've only written
a couple sentences so far.

839
00:59:34,224 --> 00:59:35,056
Can you write more?

840
00:59:35,092 --> 00:59:36,493
I kind of hate you.

841
00:59:36,528 --> 00:59:39,733
Yeah.
Well, you hate everyone.

842
00:59:40,769 --> 00:59:42,362
Listen, just keep going.

843
00:59:43,299 --> 00:59:44,299
Forget about the poem.

844
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:47,235
Write whatever you want,
whatever you're thinking.

845
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:48,874
Okay. Be quiet, just...

846
01:00:05,761 --> 01:00:08,894
You know, I was in a
really strange place in my life

847
01:00:08,929 --> 01:00:10,863
- When I married your mom.
- Did I fucking ask?

848
01:00:12,064 --> 01:00:13,767
I just wish...

849
01:00:13,802 --> 01:00:14,999
I'm sor... I'm sorry.

850
01:00:25,407 --> 01:00:27,176
I understand that you're angry.

851
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:30,751
But...

852
01:00:33,349 --> 01:00:37,857
You don't have to be angry
at the whole world.

853
01:00:41,258 --> 01:00:43,830
You can just be angry at me.

854
01:00:43,865 --> 01:00:45,106
Okay, you know what?

855
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:47,361
You can't throw me away
like a piece of garbage,

856
01:00:47,396 --> 01:00:50,804
and then suddenly just want
to be my dad eight years later.

857
01:00:50,839 --> 01:00:53,741
You left me for your boyfriend.

858
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:55,743
It's that simple.

859
01:00:55,778 --> 01:00:57,349
And if you've been telling
yourself anything different,

860
01:00:57,373 --> 01:00:58,812
then you're lying to yourself.

861
01:01:03,082 --> 01:01:04,281
But you know what? I'm glad.

862
01:01:04,317 --> 01:01:07,348
I'm glad, because you taught
me something very important.

863
01:01:08,087 --> 01:01:10,857
People are assholes.

864
01:01:11,926 --> 01:01:13,420
Most people learn that
way too late.

865
01:01:14,555 --> 01:01:16,896
You... you taught me that
when I was eight.

866
01:01:19,362 --> 01:01:20,735
Thank you for that.

867
01:01:31,176 --> 01:01:32,274
You know, you could've...

868
01:01:33,508 --> 01:01:35,376
What?

869
01:01:35,411 --> 01:01:37,051
You could've been
sending us money.

870
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,920
If you had
all that money saved up,

871
01:01:40,955 --> 01:01:42,196
and wanted to be a part
of my life so bad,

872
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:43,956
you could've been
sending money to mom.

873
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:44,957
I did.

874
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,992
Yeah, I mean more
than just child support.

875
01:01:57,972 --> 01:01:59,004
I did.

876
01:02:00,942 --> 01:02:04,405
When I left your mom, she
did not want me around you.

877
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:06,913
I hoped

878
01:02:06,948 --> 01:02:09,883
that she would change her mind
eventually, but she...

879
01:02:09,918 --> 01:02:11,511
You could have
just fucking called me.

880
01:02:13,053 --> 01:02:14,151
All this time, you...

881
01:02:15,451 --> 01:02:17,187
You could have been
a part of my life.

882
01:02:19,059 --> 01:02:20,157
Ellie.

883
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:23,094
Look at me.

884
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:31,839
Who would want me
to be a part of their life?

885
01:02:43,985 --> 01:02:45,083
I'm hungry.

886
01:02:47,153 --> 01:02:49,252
There's some stuff
for sandwiches in the fridge.

887
01:02:54,391 --> 01:02:56,226
I'll make you one,
but it's going to be small.

888
01:03:00,562 --> 01:03:02,265
And I'm only using Turkey,

889
01:03:03,103 --> 01:03:04,267
and no mayonnaise.

890
01:03:09,637 --> 01:03:11,340
- What?
- Nothing.

891
01:03:12,607 --> 01:03:14,508
You're an amazing person, Ellie.

892
01:03:14,543 --> 01:03:18,281
I hope you know what an
amazing person you are.

893
01:03:18,316 --> 01:03:21,482
I couldn't ask for a
more incredible daughter.

894
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,190
I'll print that out for you now.

895
01:05:20,735 --> 01:05:22,471
Yeah?

896
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:24,209
Uh... hello?

897
01:05:27,181 --> 01:05:28,510
Hi.

898
01:05:30,283 --> 01:05:31,283
Come on.

899
01:05:32,549 --> 01:05:33,680
Is he...

900
01:05:33,715 --> 01:05:34,814
Is he okay? I don't know.

901
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:37,288
I ground up some Ambien
and I put it in his sandwich.

902
01:05:37,323 --> 01:05:38,388
What?

903
01:05:38,423 --> 01:05:40,093
I only gave him a couple.
He's fine.

904
01:05:40,128 --> 01:05:41,270
I can take, like,
three at a time.

905
01:05:41,294 --> 01:05:42,469
Where did you get Ambien?

906
01:05:42,493 --> 01:05:43,624
I had sex with a pharmacist.

907
01:05:45,628 --> 01:05:47,430
I'm kidding. Gross.

908
01:05:47,465 --> 01:05:49,168
My mom pops them like tic tacs.

909
01:05:49,203 --> 01:05:51,071
I don't know if he should
be taking Ambien.

910
01:05:53,537 --> 01:05:56,076
Does this make you nervous?
'Cause it's just pot.

911
01:05:56,111 --> 01:05:57,803
It's not like
I'm smoking meth or anything.

912
01:05:57,838 --> 01:05:59,706
I know. I...
I know what pot is, okay?

913
01:05:59,741 --> 01:06:01,675
No. You only think
you know what pot is

914
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:03,820
because your parents told you
a bunch of lies about it.

915
01:06:03,844 --> 01:06:05,481
Don't. I know what drugs are.

916
01:06:05,516 --> 01:06:08,385
- I've smoked pot before.
- Ooh. Oh, I'm so impressed.

917
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:10,189
I wasn't trying to impress you.

918
01:06:10,224 --> 01:06:12,488
- You've not smoked pot before.
- Yes, I have. It...

919
01:06:14,492 --> 01:06:15,623
It was kind of a problem.

920
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:18,197
That is the stupidest
fucking thing

921
01:06:18,232 --> 01:06:19,064
I've ever heard
in my entire life.

922
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,728
I was smoking every day.
I had a problem.

923
01:06:21,763 --> 01:06:24,830
You were a stoner.
You had a hobby.

924
01:06:24,865 --> 01:06:26,810
All right, I'm gonna go. Just
tell him I was here and I'll...

925
01:06:26,834 --> 01:06:29,252
If you leave, I'll feed him the
rest of the pills I have in the bottle.

926
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:30,836
- What?
- Yeah.

927
01:06:30,871 --> 01:06:33,608
There's, like, 20,
30 more in here.

928
01:06:34,545 --> 01:06:35,808
I'll crush them up,

929
01:06:35,843 --> 01:06:37,843
I'll put them in some water,

930
01:06:37,878 --> 01:06:39,251
And I'll pour it
down his throat.

931
01:06:40,188 --> 01:06:41,330
You wouldn't actually do that,

932
01:06:41,354 --> 01:06:42,485
- Would you?
- Sit down.

933
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,000
So, why do you keep
coming back here?

934
01:06:52,893 --> 01:06:54,134
He needs help.

935
01:06:55,269 --> 01:06:56,312
He needs god in his life
right now.

936
01:06:56,336 --> 01:06:57,401
That's a stupid reason.

937
01:06:58,635 --> 01:07:00,800
Do you think he wants
to have sex with you?

938
01:07:00,835 --> 01:07:03,209
That is so gross,
oh, my god. Take a hit.

939
01:07:03,244 --> 01:07:04,617
- I don't want...
- If you don't take a hit,

940
01:07:04,641 --> 01:07:05,941
I'm gonna call the police

941
01:07:05,976 --> 01:07:08,376
and I'm gonna tell them that
you tried to rape me. Take a hit.

942
01:07:10,581 --> 01:07:11,811
I don't understand you at all.

943
01:07:12,451 --> 01:07:13,451
Oh, my god.

944
01:07:14,783 --> 01:07:16,288
Is there a carb on this?

945
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:17,718
Ooh, I'm impressed.

946
01:07:17,753 --> 01:07:19,456
I wasn't trying to impress you.

947
01:07:19,491 --> 01:07:20,523
There isn't a carb.

948
01:07:32,537 --> 01:07:33,636
Calm down.

949
01:07:33,672 --> 01:07:35,351
What are you
gonna do with that picture?

950
01:07:35,375 --> 01:07:36,704
I'm gonna masturbate to it.

951
01:07:36,739 --> 01:07:37,848
Is that what you want me to say?

952
01:07:37,872 --> 01:07:39,245
You're a pervert.
Take another hit.

953
01:07:41,249 --> 01:07:43,348
Look, I'm just fucking
with you, all right?

954
01:07:43,383 --> 01:07:44,811
I'm not gonna kill anyone,

955
01:07:44,846 --> 01:07:47,847
I'm not gonna tell anyone
that you tried to rape me.

956
01:07:47,882 --> 01:07:49,464
You're not going to give him
any more Ambien?

957
01:07:49,488 --> 01:07:50,751
No.

958
01:07:52,524 --> 01:07:54,194
Why do you
keep coming back here?

959
01:07:56,594 --> 01:07:58,330
I don't know.

960
01:07:58,365 --> 01:07:59,870
Seriously, if you hate him
so much, then why...

961
01:07:59,894 --> 01:08:01,432
I'm done answering
questions now.

962
01:08:07,704 --> 01:08:08,802
Can I take another hit?

963
01:08:10,608 --> 01:08:11,838
It goes against your religion,

964
01:08:13,314 --> 01:08:14,554
and that makes you a hypocrite.

965
01:08:16,482 --> 01:08:17,482
Go ahead.

966
01:08:28,527 --> 01:08:29,735
I really wish
that you wouldn't do that.

967
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,363
Yeah, I know.
I heard you the first time.

968
01:08:32,564 --> 01:08:33,604
Do you find me attractive?

969
01:08:35,633 --> 01:08:37,534
Because I'm not attracted
to you at all,

970
01:08:38,306 --> 01:08:40,240
just to let you know.

971
01:08:40,275 --> 01:08:41,450
I'm not trying to be mean
or anything.

972
01:08:41,474 --> 01:08:43,194
I just don't think
you're very good-looking,

973
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:44,772
or interesting.

974
01:08:45,511 --> 01:08:46,511
Or intelligent.

975
01:08:48,943 --> 01:08:50,382
Oh, my god, grow up.

976
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:51,724
Maybe someone else
finds you attractive.

977
01:08:51,748 --> 01:08:52,714
Maybe my dad
finds you attractive.

978
01:08:52,749 --> 01:08:54,815
- I really wish you...
- You know, it is so easy

979
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:55,890
to make you uncomfortable.

980
01:08:55,917 --> 01:08:57,554
It's honestly...
It's a little sad.

981
01:08:58,458 --> 01:08:59,458
You can cash that out.

982
01:09:13,539 --> 01:09:16,441
If my parents knew
I was getting high,

983
01:09:16,476 --> 01:09:17,882
getting high while out
witnessing for the church...

984
01:09:17,906 --> 01:09:18,906
You're not from new life.

985
01:09:20,711 --> 01:09:21,777
What?

986
01:09:21,812 --> 01:09:24,614
There's a kid in the grade
below me who goes there.

987
01:09:24,649 --> 01:09:25,758
He told me
that they stopped doing

988
01:09:25,782 --> 01:09:27,617
door-to-door stuff last year

989
01:09:27,652 --> 01:09:29,850
when some woman was
out preaching or whatever,

990
01:09:29,885 --> 01:09:31,984
and a guy answered the door
with no clothes on.

991
01:09:33,427 --> 01:09:35,427
- I gotta go.
- Who are you, really?

992
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:38,430
Come on, just tell me!

993
01:09:39,664 --> 01:09:41,477
- Why do you care?
- Because I think we have

994
01:09:41,501 --> 01:09:42,698
A blossoming friendship.

995
01:09:44,405 --> 01:09:45,569
You're just messing with me.

996
01:09:46,968 --> 01:09:48,275
No, I'm not.

997
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:50,756
You're not going to tell anyone?

998
01:09:52,347 --> 01:09:53,347
Who am I gonna tell?

999
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:02,685
I was on a mission.

1000
01:10:06,394 --> 01:10:08,394
With a group from my church,
back in Waterloo,

1001
01:10:09,628 --> 01:10:10,891
my hometown in Iowa.

1002
01:10:12,367 --> 01:10:13,894
When my dad
caught me smoking pot,

1003
01:10:13,929 --> 01:10:16,600
he thought a mission
would be a good idea.

1004
01:10:16,635 --> 01:10:19,735
I mean, the truth is,
he's just embarrassed by me

1005
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:21,968
and wanted me gone for a while.

1006
01:10:22,839 --> 01:10:24,971
Anyway, I just left.

1007
01:10:28,416 --> 01:10:29,514
I couldn't do it anymore.

1008
01:10:31,551 --> 01:10:32,551
Why?

1009
01:10:33,685 --> 01:10:34,717
The mission leader,

1010
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:37,489
this guy, Jerry,

1011
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:39,095
all he had us doing
was standing on corners

1012
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:41,053
and handing out pamphlets.

1013
01:10:41,088 --> 01:10:42,527
The end of each day,
he'd be like,

1014
01:10:42,562 --> 01:10:44,282
"look how many people
we're helping," but...

1015
01:10:44,927 --> 01:10:45,992
I tried to talk to him

1016
01:10:46,027 --> 01:10:47,405
about different ways
we can minister.

1017
01:10:47,429 --> 01:10:50,733
I mean, different ways that we
could actually help people. But...

1018
01:10:52,033 --> 01:10:54,506
You could just tell
that he didn't need to earn

1019
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:55,903
or prove his faith at all.

1020
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:02,514
After a while, I was just,
like, "Am I really helping?"

1021
01:11:03,748 --> 01:11:05,583
No. You were not.

1022
01:11:07,147 --> 01:11:08,817
Yeah, I started to feel
that way, too.

1023
01:11:10,854 --> 01:11:11,753
I don't feel that way,

1024
01:11:11,789 --> 01:11:14,053
I know that you weren't
helping people.

1025
01:11:14,088 --> 01:11:15,461
It doesn't help people
to tell them

1026
01:11:15,496 --> 01:11:16,704
that they should believe in god.

1027
01:11:16,728 --> 01:11:17,808
Why would that help people?

1028
01:11:18,796 --> 01:11:20,565
I just thought...

1029
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,534
I see all my family, my friends,

1030
01:11:24,065 --> 01:11:25,471
they're all just so happy.

1031
01:11:30,511 --> 01:11:31,708
I just want to be like that.

1032
01:11:33,943 --> 01:11:35,008
So, why'd you leave, then?

1033
01:11:36,715 --> 01:11:39,078
I was worried
I was gonna get arrested.

1034
01:11:40,015 --> 01:11:41,015
For smoking pot?

1035
01:11:42,721 --> 01:11:43,921
For stealing from the mission.

1036
01:11:51,961 --> 01:11:54,896
One day,
I ditched the pamphlets.

1037
01:11:54,931 --> 01:11:55,830
I went door-to-door.

1038
01:11:55,866 --> 01:11:57,833
I started actually
engaging with people.

1039
01:11:57,868 --> 01:12:00,737
Finally. I mean, it felt
like I was doing something,

1040
01:12:00,772 --> 01:12:01,837
helping someone.

1041
01:12:05,579 --> 01:12:08,514
And that night, I went back
to the mission meeting,

1042
01:12:08,549 --> 01:12:09,988
and I told everyone
what I did that day,

1043
01:12:10,012 --> 01:12:11,924
and Jerry was like, "that's
not what we do, buddy."

1044
01:12:11,948 --> 01:12:13,248
And I was like, "well, why not?"

1045
01:12:13,283 --> 01:12:15,643
And we got in this huge
argument in front of everyone, and...

1046
01:12:20,462 --> 01:12:23,628
And that night,
I decided to leave.

1047
01:12:23,663 --> 01:12:25,696
And when everyone
was asleep, I...

1048
01:12:25,731 --> 01:12:26,829
I took the petty cash.

1049
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,865
How much?

1050
01:12:33,508 --> 01:12:35,541
$2,436.

1051
01:12:37,743 --> 01:12:39,072
Oh.

1052
01:12:39,107 --> 01:12:40,480
Yeah. "Oh."

1053
01:12:42,517 --> 01:12:43,517
I got on a bus.

1054
01:12:44,816 --> 01:12:46,684
Jerry and my parents
were calling me

1055
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:47,949
over and over again.

1056
01:12:49,722 --> 01:12:51,084
I just tossed my phone.

1057
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:56,529
After a while, I wound up here.

1058
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:02,601
I thought I could use this money

1059
01:13:02,636 --> 01:13:03,767
for my own mission.

1060
01:13:05,573 --> 01:13:08,134
You know, see my faith save
just one person.

1061
01:13:09,874 --> 01:13:11,907
But now I'm almost
out of money. I just...

1062
01:13:13,273 --> 01:13:15,548
I can't go home, and...

1063
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:17,110
My parents probably
wanna disown me.

1064
01:13:22,953 --> 01:13:24,233
I don't know what to do.

1065
01:13:35,064 --> 01:13:36,668
You're more interesting
to me now.

1066
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:40,738
Thanks.

1067
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:54,995
So, that's why
you wanna save my dad.

1068
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:17,104
Mom?

1069
01:14:17,139 --> 01:14:18,677
- Don't freak out.
- Shut up.

1070
01:14:21,143 --> 01:14:22,175
You again?

1071
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:24,210
Charlie?

1072
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:25,751
Charlie?

1073
01:14:27,886 --> 01:14:28,951
Charlie?

1074
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:31,690
Charlie.

1075
01:14:46,366 --> 01:14:47,640
Not with the oxygen tank.

1076
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:50,875
I'll stand by the window.

1077
01:14:57,883 --> 01:15:00,983
Ellie told you
she was coming over?

1078
01:15:01,018 --> 01:15:02,721
No. I did.

1079
01:15:02,756 --> 01:15:04,052
And just in time, looks like.

1080
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:06,989
You having any more pain?

1081
01:15:08,729 --> 01:15:10,190
How easy is it to move?

1082
01:15:11,061 --> 01:15:12,258
Not very.

1083
01:15:12,293 --> 01:15:14,832
Any confusion?
Have you felt disoriented,

1084
01:15:14,867 --> 01:15:16,273
forgotten where you are
or what you're doing?

1085
01:15:16,297 --> 01:15:19,903
- Am I okay?
- No, you're not okay.

1086
01:15:19,938 --> 01:15:21,377
But as far as the
sleeping pills, you're fine.

1087
01:15:21,401 --> 01:15:22,774
I don't think she gave you much.

1088
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:23,969
Yeah, that's what I told you.

1089
01:15:26,142 --> 01:15:27,680
You know, I was a very angry,

1090
01:15:27,715 --> 01:15:28,892
very stupid little girl
once, too,

1091
01:15:28,916 --> 01:15:30,628
but if you would've given him
any more pills than that...

1092
01:15:30,652 --> 01:15:32,058
Yeah, but I didn't give him
more pills than that,

1093
01:15:32,082 --> 01:15:33,752
- I gave him two pills.
- Ellie?

1094
01:15:34,953 --> 01:15:36,233
How much money did he offer you?

1095
01:15:42,191 --> 01:15:44,191
- All of it?
- How do you know about the money?

1096
01:15:44,996 --> 01:15:47,161
You think I'm an idiot?

1097
01:15:47,196 --> 01:15:49,075
You think I would believe
that you were coming over here

1098
01:15:49,099 --> 01:15:50,419
out of the kindness
of your heart?

1099
01:15:51,431 --> 01:15:54,806
Charlie doesn't have any money.

1100
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:58,678
- She doesn't know?
- Mary.

1101
01:15:58,713 --> 01:15:59,756
Where do you think all the money

1102
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:01,060
from his teaching
has been going?

1103
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:03,144
The account for Ellie?

1104
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:05,212
By now, it has to be huge.

1105
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,884
Over $100,000 at least, right?

1106
01:16:12,452 --> 01:16:13,858
That's not true, is it?

1107
01:16:17,798 --> 01:16:18,929
Charlie.

1108
01:16:20,295 --> 01:16:22,295
We could have gotten you
anything you needed.

1109
01:16:23,771 --> 01:16:25,199
Special beds,
physical therapists,

1110
01:16:25,234 --> 01:16:27,267
fucking health insurance!

1111
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:31,216
Last winter,
when my pick-up broke down

1112
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,448
and I had to walk
through the snow

1113
01:16:32,472 --> 01:16:33,812
to get your groceries for you...

1114
01:16:33,847 --> 01:16:35,242
I offered to get
your truck fixed.

1115
01:16:35,277 --> 01:16:38,113
Yeah, and I refused because
I thought you had $700

1116
01:16:38,148 --> 01:16:40,346
- in your bank account.
- The money is for Ellie.

1117
01:16:41,756 --> 01:16:43,756
It's always been for Ellie.

1118
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:46,154
If there was ever
any kind of emergency,

1119
01:16:46,189 --> 01:16:48,057
- I would have given you the money.
- Would you?

1120
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:53,062
Wait.

1121
01:16:56,969 --> 01:16:58,298
Wait.

1122
01:17:01,402 --> 01:17:02,918
Mom, you're not getting
any of my money.

1123
01:17:02,942 --> 01:17:03,942
Oh, shut up, Ellie.

1124
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:07,373
Leave, right now.

1125
01:17:10,785 --> 01:17:12,118
Wait.

1126
01:17:12,153 --> 01:17:15,216
Ellie, I know you didn't mean
to hurt me. I know you didn't...

1127
01:17:15,251 --> 01:17:16,866
Okay, you know what?
Listen to me. Listen.

1128
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:18,725
I don't care about you!

1129
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,287
Get that through
your fucking skull.

1130
01:17:20,322 --> 01:17:22,729
- Ellie, please.
- Just fucking die already!

1131
01:17:23,259 --> 01:17:24,698
Enough!

1132
01:17:28,132 --> 01:17:29,395
Ellie, your... your essay.

1133
01:17:37,812 --> 01:17:40,274
So... it's...

1134
01:17:43,246 --> 01:17:44,751
It's a really good essay!

1135
01:18:12,374 --> 01:18:14,407
Jesus, Charlie.

1136
01:18:22,351 --> 01:18:23,416
Do you have anything?

1137
01:18:27,829 --> 01:18:29,257
It's above the sink,

1138
01:18:29,292 --> 01:18:31,226
the kitchen counter on the left.

1139
01:18:33,296 --> 01:18:35,230
The other one. Yup.

1140
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,368
Our deal was

1141
01:18:41,403 --> 01:18:43,684
to wait until she's out of the
house to give her the money.

1142
01:18:44,274 --> 01:18:45,911
What's the difference?

1143
01:18:45,946 --> 01:18:49,915
The difference is she's 17
and still in high school.

1144
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:52,852
She's gonna spend it on face
tattoos or ponies, or something.

1145
01:18:52,887 --> 01:18:55,151
I think that she's
a lot smarter than that.

1146
01:18:58,387 --> 01:18:59,387
So...

1147
01:19:02,490 --> 01:19:03,490
How's it been?

1148
01:19:04,932 --> 01:19:06,800
Getting to know her.

1149
01:19:07,902 --> 01:19:10,232
She's amazing.

1150
01:19:10,267 --> 01:19:12,267
You still do that.

1151
01:19:14,106 --> 01:19:15,106
What?

1152
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:17,470
That positivity.

1153
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:20,210
It's so annoying.

1154
01:19:21,245 --> 01:19:22,442
You're a complete cynic.

1155
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:25,918
Just trying to balance us out.

1156
01:19:25,953 --> 01:19:27,953
Yeah. I guess I do miss that.

1157
01:19:29,154 --> 01:19:30,186
That one thing.

1158
01:19:31,618 --> 01:19:32,826
Just that?

1159
01:19:34,654 --> 01:19:36,829
That, and the cooking.

1160
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:37,982
Last month,

1161
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:39,817
- Tried to make a stir-fry thing.
- Yeah?

1162
01:19:39,967 --> 01:19:41,637
Almost set the entire
apartment building on fire.

1163
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:04,710
I never knew you were
doing this to yourself.

1164
01:20:06,224 --> 01:20:08,323
Well, you never asked
how I was doing.

1165
01:20:09,656 --> 01:20:11,425
You never asked
how I was doing either.

1166
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:14,626
Every month, it's just,

1167
01:20:14,661 --> 01:20:17,497
"how much money do you need?"
Or, "how's Ellie?"

1168
01:20:17,532 --> 01:20:20,566
You didn't tell me that
she's flunking out of school.

1169
01:20:20,601 --> 01:20:22,205
I guess I just didn't need
the lecture

1170
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,943
about my involvement
in her education.

1171
01:20:23,978 --> 01:20:26,440
That is not what I...

1172
01:20:32,481 --> 01:20:34,085
How're you doing, Mary?

1173
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:42,928
I know I'm not supposed
to be around her.

1174
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:45,132
You could probably call the police
if you wanted to.

1175
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:47,760
Oh, Christ.
You really think I'd do that?

1176
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,970
You fought me pretty hard
for full custody.

1177
01:20:51,005 --> 01:20:53,236
And I don't blame you
for keeping her from me.

1178
01:20:53,271 --> 01:20:57,405
Charlie, need I remind you
that you left us.

1179
01:20:58,177 --> 01:20:59,308
I know.

1180
01:20:59,343 --> 01:21:01,244
And I was left raising our kid

1181
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:04,577
and explaining to people that
my husband left me for a man.

1182
01:21:04,612 --> 01:21:07,151
But you didn't have to cut
me out of her life like that.

1183
01:21:07,186 --> 01:21:08,319
Oh, please.

1184
01:21:08,354 --> 01:21:10,495
You were more than happy
to forget about us for a while.

1185
01:21:10,519 --> 01:21:11,519
You know that.

1186
01:21:13,456 --> 01:21:15,423
I know I made a lot of mistakes.

1187
01:21:17,658 --> 01:21:20,593
But I just wanted
to see her, Mary.

1188
01:21:20,628 --> 01:21:23,101
I've always just...
Just wanted to see her.

1189
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:25,565
It's all about you.

1190
01:21:27,404 --> 01:21:29,140
Even now, huh?

1191
01:21:31,573 --> 01:21:33,243
Now you know why
I kept you from her.

1192
01:21:34,312 --> 01:21:35,312
What?

1193
01:21:37,051 --> 01:21:39,986
She's awful. Isn't she?

1194
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:43,319
She's a terror.
And you think it's my fault.

1195
01:21:43,354 --> 01:21:48,159
Wait, is that why you kept
her from me all this time?

1196
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:52,361
Because you thought that I would
think that you're a bad mother?

1197
01:21:53,463 --> 01:21:54,463
At first.

1198
01:21:55,729 --> 01:21:58,730
But later, when she was 15, 16,

1199
01:22:01,075 --> 01:22:02,503
I was worried
she would hurt you.

1200
01:22:03,143 --> 01:22:04,143
Hurt me?

1201
01:22:05,376 --> 01:22:06,474
It's ridiculous.

1202
01:22:06,509 --> 01:22:08,311
I don't take any pleasure
in admitting it.

1203
01:22:08,346 --> 01:22:10,742
I'm her mother,
for Christ's sake.

1204
01:22:10,777 --> 01:22:13,580
You know, I spent way
too much time telling myself,

1205
01:22:13,615 --> 01:22:16,022
you know,
"she's just rebellious,

1206
01:22:16,057 --> 01:22:17,188
"she's just difficult."

1207
01:22:19,555 --> 01:22:22,193
Charlie, she's evil.

1208
01:22:23,559 --> 01:22:24,723
She's not evil.

1209
01:22:31,468 --> 01:22:32,500
What are you doing?

1210
01:22:38,442 --> 01:22:40,046
You think it's just me?

1211
01:22:51,752 --> 01:22:55,094
"There'll be a grease fire in
hell when he starts to burn."

1212
01:23:02,532 --> 01:23:03,532
Don't feel bad.

1213
01:23:05,106 --> 01:23:07,238
I've made quite a few
appearances on that thing.

1214
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:12,243
She's a strong writer.

1215
01:23:14,412 --> 01:23:16,181
That's your response?

1216
01:23:16,216 --> 01:23:17,281
This isn't evil.

1217
01:23:17,778 --> 01:23:19,382
This is honesty.

1218
01:23:19,417 --> 01:23:21,813
Do you know how much bullshit
I've read in my life?

1219
01:23:21,848 --> 01:23:24,684
My god, I don't
understand you, Charlie!

1220
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:26,719
Every time I call
and ask you how she's doing,

1221
01:23:26,754 --> 01:23:28,094
you say, "she's fine."

1222
01:23:28,756 --> 01:23:30,327
If she's so evil, then...

1223
01:23:30,362 --> 01:23:31,867
What was I supposed to tell you?

1224
01:23:31,891 --> 01:23:34,562
Huh? That she was off
making her classmates cry

1225
01:23:34,597 --> 01:23:36,135
or slashing her teachers' tires?

1226
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:37,444
You didn't want
to hear that stuff!

1227
01:23:37,468 --> 01:23:38,567
I could have helped her!

1228
01:23:38,603 --> 01:23:42,141
She doesn't want your help!
She doesn't want anyone!

1229
01:23:42,176 --> 01:23:44,143
You think I didn't want her
to have a dad?

1230
01:23:44,838 --> 01:23:46,508
She adored you!

1231
01:23:46,543 --> 01:23:48,389
The only reason you
married me in the first place

1232
01:23:48,413 --> 01:23:50,215
was to have a kid, I know that!

1233
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:51,414
Mary, please!

1234
01:23:57,290 --> 01:24:00,489
Well, this brings back
memories, doesn't it?

1235
01:24:19,675 --> 01:24:20,675
Listen.

1236
01:24:23,514 --> 01:24:25,448
I never got to say
that I was sorry.

1237
01:24:27,353 --> 01:24:29,716
What would you have
to be sorry about?

1238
01:24:29,751 --> 01:24:30,816
That's not what I mean.

1239
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:33,490
I mean...

1240
01:24:38,265 --> 01:24:40,562
About your friend.

1241
01:24:41,928 --> 01:24:43,136
Oh.

1242
01:24:46,669 --> 01:24:47,734
His name was Alan.

1243
01:24:47,769 --> 01:24:49,439
I know
his fucking name, Charlie.

1244
01:24:54,215 --> 01:24:55,215
I saw him once,

1245
01:24:56,811 --> 01:24:58,250
in the Walmart parking lot.

1246
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:00,086
He wasn't looking too good,

1247
01:25:00,121 --> 01:25:02,155
and I don't think
it was long before he...

1248
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:06,819
Anyway, I had
all these things that I...

1249
01:25:06,854 --> 01:25:07,854
I wanted to say to him,

1250
01:25:07,889 --> 01:25:09,756
you know, hurl at him
like bricks.

1251
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,495
But I...

1252
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:14,167
I asked if he wanted some help.

1253
01:25:16,633 --> 01:25:18,633
He let me carry
a couple of bags to his car,

1254
01:25:19,933 --> 01:25:21,240
he said thank you,

1255
01:25:22,837 --> 01:25:23,837
and I left.

1256
01:25:27,677 --> 01:25:29,281
I never even told him who I was.

1257
01:25:38,391 --> 01:25:39,423
You're wheezing.

1258
01:25:40,789 --> 01:25:43,526
Yeah, it's gotten worse.

1259
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:45,561
Should I call someone?

1260
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:48,333
No. Um...

1261
01:25:53,604 --> 01:25:54,702
You'll let me hear?

1262
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:20,695
How do I sound?

1263
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:30,969
That was the first time
we've all been together

1264
01:26:31,004 --> 01:26:33,774
in almost nine years.
Do you realize that?

1265
01:26:43,555 --> 01:26:45,489
When Ellie was little,

1266
01:26:45,524 --> 01:26:49,262
when we took that trip
to the Oregon coast together,

1267
01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:52,397
Ellie played in the sand, and...

1268
01:26:53,895 --> 01:26:55,763
We laid out on the beach.

1269
01:26:57,096 --> 01:26:58,733
I went swimming in the ocean.

1270
01:27:01,408 --> 01:27:03,903
That was the last time
I ever went swimming, actually.

1271
01:27:06,974 --> 01:27:09,414
I kept cutting my legs
on the rocks.

1272
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:14,980
The water was so cold.

1273
01:27:26,697 --> 01:27:30,501
And you were so mad
that my legs bled

1274
01:27:30,536 --> 01:27:32,800
and stained the seats
in the minivan.

1275
01:27:34,103 --> 01:27:38,707
And you said, for days after
that, I smelled like seawater.

1276
01:27:40,711 --> 01:27:42,414
You remember that?

1277
01:27:49,984 --> 01:27:51,324
You sound awful.

1278
01:27:52,822 --> 01:27:55,020
I'm dying, Mary.

1279
01:27:59,092 --> 01:28:00,092
Fuck you.

1280
01:28:02,029 --> 01:28:03,369
I'm sorry.

1281
01:28:04,834 --> 01:28:05,932
Fuck you.

1282
01:28:08,838 --> 01:28:09,969
For sure?

1283
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,478
Yeah. For sure.

1284
01:28:15,647 --> 01:28:16,844
Listen to me.

1285
01:28:19,849 --> 01:28:22,388
I need to make certain
that she's going to be okay.

1286
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:24,687
We can't give up on her.

1287
01:28:25,525 --> 01:28:27,151
You already gave up on her!

1288
01:28:27,186 --> 01:28:29,120
You gave up on her
when she was eight years old!

1289
01:28:29,155 --> 01:28:32,156
I wish I could have been
a part of her life, Mary,

1290
01:28:32,191 --> 01:28:34,059
a part of both of your lives.

1291
01:28:34,094 --> 01:28:35,094
Go to the hospital.

1292
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:38,701
You have money,
just go to the hospital!

1293
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:44,102
We both know that
that money is for Ellie.

1294
01:28:45,105 --> 01:28:49,481
But beyond that,

1295
01:28:49,516 --> 01:28:53,584
I need to know that she's
gonna have a decent life.

1296
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:56,917
Where she cares about people

1297
01:28:56,952 --> 01:28:59,051
and other people care about her.

1298
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,560
And she's gonna be okay.

1299
01:29:03,563 --> 01:29:04,529
- I need to go.
- Mary.

1300
01:29:04,564 --> 01:29:08,093
She doesn't have
anyone else! I have to go.

1301
01:29:08,128 --> 01:29:10,766
I need to know that I have done

1302
01:29:10,801 --> 01:29:13,604
one thing right with my life!

1303
01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:18,576
We both played our parts.

1304
01:29:20,074 --> 01:29:22,613
I raised her, and you're
giving her the money.

1305
01:29:23,242 --> 01:29:24,549
It's the best we could do.

1306
01:29:30,623 --> 01:29:31,623
Do you need anything

1307
01:29:33,054 --> 01:29:34,086
before I leave?

1308
01:29:35,089 --> 01:29:36,429
Water, or something.

1309
01:30:47,227 --> 01:30:48,864
Gambino's!

1310
01:30:48,899 --> 01:30:50,998
Yeah.

1311
01:30:51,033 --> 01:30:52,033
Charlie?

1312
01:30:53,233 --> 01:30:54,233
You okay?

1313
01:30:56,038 --> 01:30:57,906
Yeah.

1314
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:01,107
The money is in the, um...

1315
01:31:02,682 --> 01:31:03,714
Sure.

1316
01:31:07,786 --> 01:31:09,148
You sure you're doing okay?

1317
01:31:11,251 --> 01:31:13,251
Yeah. Thanks, Dan.

1318
01:31:13,286 --> 01:31:15,088
Have a good night, okay?

1319
01:32:35,368 --> 01:32:37,005
Fuck these essays.

1320
01:32:38,074 --> 01:32:39,238
Fuck these readings.

1321
01:32:41,814 --> 01:32:45,915
Just write something fucking
honest.

1322
01:34:16,975 --> 01:34:18,304
Liz?

1323
01:34:22,244 --> 01:34:23,375
Can I come inside?

1324
01:34:25,148 --> 01:34:26,180
It's not locked.

1325
01:34:28,448 --> 01:34:29,755
- Hi.
- What's wrong?

1326
01:34:30,417 --> 01:34:31,922
- Thank you.
- For what?

1327
01:34:31,957 --> 01:34:34,826
Look, I'm not exactly
who I said I was.

1328
01:34:34,861 --> 01:34:36,454
I'm not from new life.

1329
01:34:36,489 --> 01:34:38,060
What? I... I don't...

1330
01:34:38,095 --> 01:34:40,029
I've been in a pretty bad
place recently.

1331
01:34:40,064 --> 01:34:41,426
I... I stole some money,

1332
01:34:41,461 --> 01:34:43,461
and I ran away from home
a few months ago.

1333
01:34:43,496 --> 01:34:46,332
And your daughter, she took
these pictures of me smoking pot,

1334
01:34:46,367 --> 01:34:48,774
and a recording
or something like that,

1335
01:34:48,809 --> 01:34:50,974
and she found my church
in Waterloo somehow,

1336
01:34:51,009 --> 01:34:52,173
and then she sent it to them,

1337
01:34:52,208 --> 01:34:53,311
and they sent it to
my parents...

1338
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:55,440
- Wait.
- And you know what they said?

1339
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:57,112
"It's just money."

1340
01:34:58,214 --> 01:35:00,115
And they forgive me.

1341
01:35:00,150 --> 01:35:02,920
And they love me, and
they want me to come home.

1342
01:35:04,517 --> 01:35:06,055
How awful is that?

1343
01:35:07,157 --> 01:35:09,828
Ellie, she... She did all that?

1344
01:35:09,863 --> 01:35:14,096
I can't tell if she was trying
to help me or hurt me or...

1345
01:35:14,131 --> 01:35:15,438
Do you ever get that
feeling from her?

1346
01:35:15,462 --> 01:35:17,099
How did she even... she...

1347
01:35:18,971 --> 01:35:21,840
She found your church,
she tracked down your parents.

1348
01:35:23,173 --> 01:35:24,469
She really did all that?

1349
01:35:24,504 --> 01:35:26,207
Yeah. I mean,
I'm going home tomorrow.

1350
01:35:27,309 --> 01:35:28,946
But, Charlie, before I go...

1351
01:35:28,981 --> 01:35:30,376
I have to show you this.

1352
01:35:32,347 --> 01:35:33,951
What... what's wrong?

1353
01:35:33,986 --> 01:35:35,216
Wait, are you okay?

1354
01:35:35,251 --> 01:35:37,251
It just hurts. Charlie,

1355
01:35:37,286 --> 01:35:39,517
I want to help you.
I know I can help you.

1356
01:35:39,552 --> 01:35:41,453
I'm not going to the hospital.

1357
01:35:41,488 --> 01:35:42,993
No, I know.
I'm not gonna make you go.

1358
01:35:43,028 --> 01:35:44,291
But I can help you.

1359
01:35:46,262 --> 01:35:47,877
- "Therefore, brothers and sisters...
- What are you doing?

1360
01:35:47,901 --> 01:35:49,197
"We have an obligation,

1361
01:35:49,232 --> 01:35:51,430
"but it is not to the flesh,
to live according to it.

1362
01:35:51,465 --> 01:35:54,202
"For if you live according
to the flesh, you will die.

1363
01:35:54,237 --> 01:35:56,567
"But if by the spirit
you put to death

1364
01:35:56,602 --> 01:35:59,174
"The misdeeds of the body,
then you will live."

1365
01:35:59,209 --> 01:36:01,077
I... I don't understand.

1366
01:36:01,112 --> 01:36:04,014
Charlie, when I read this,
I finally got it.

1367
01:36:04,049 --> 01:36:07,380
I finally understood why
god brought me here to you.

1368
01:36:07,415 --> 01:36:09,547
So I could help you understand
what happened to Alan,

1369
01:36:09,582 --> 01:36:11,087
so it doesn't happen
to you, too.

1370
01:36:14,125 --> 01:36:15,058
How did you get this?

1371
01:36:15,093 --> 01:36:18,490
Charlie, Alan tried
to escape god's will.

1372
01:36:18,525 --> 01:36:20,899
He chose his life with you
over god.

1373
01:36:20,934 --> 01:36:24,496
But this is why he was so
obsessed with this verse.

1374
01:36:24,531 --> 01:36:26,300
He knew that he was living
in the flesh,

1375
01:36:26,335 --> 01:36:27,568
and not in the spirit.

1376
01:36:27,603 --> 01:36:30,942
He never prayed for salvation,
but it's not too late for you.

1377
01:36:30,977 --> 01:36:32,537
Through the spirit,
you can put to death

1378
01:36:32,572 --> 01:36:34,913
the misdeeds of the body,
and you will live.

1379
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:39,049
You think Alan died because
he chose to be with me?

1380
01:36:41,350 --> 01:36:42,987
You think god
turned his back on him

1381
01:36:43,022 --> 01:36:44,222
because he and I were in love?

1382
01:36:48,423 --> 01:36:49,423
Yes.

1383
01:36:58,037 --> 01:37:00,334
You know something?
I wasn't always this big.

1384
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:03,975
Yeah, I know.

1385
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:06,307
I mean, I wasn't the
best-looking guy in the room, but...

1386
01:37:08,014 --> 01:37:09,014
Alan loved me.

1387
01:37:12,084 --> 01:37:13,182
He thought I was beautiful.

1388
01:37:17,716 --> 01:37:18,924
Okay.

1389
01:37:21,126 --> 01:37:22,895
Halfway through the semester,

1390
01:37:24,327 --> 01:37:27,966
he started meeting me
during my office hours.

1391
01:37:28,001 --> 01:37:32,168
And we were... We were
crazy about one another.

1392
01:37:32,203 --> 01:37:34,236
But we waited

1393
01:37:34,271 --> 01:37:37,008
until the class
was over before...

1394
01:37:37,043 --> 01:37:38,076
This isn't, uh...

1395
01:37:38,111 --> 01:37:41,441
It was just after classes
had ended for the year.

1396
01:37:41,476 --> 01:37:43,377
It was perfect
temperature outside.

1397
01:37:44,446 --> 01:37:46,347
We took a walk in the arboretum,

1398
01:37:48,989 --> 01:37:50,021
and we kissed.

1399
01:37:50,518 --> 01:37:52,287
Charlie, stop.

1400
01:37:52,322 --> 01:37:55,653
We would spend entire nights
lying together, naked.

1401
01:37:58,262 --> 01:37:59,360
We would make love.

1402
01:38:05,071 --> 01:38:06,169
We would make love.

1403
01:38:09,438 --> 01:38:11,108
Do you find that disgusting?

1404
01:38:11,143 --> 01:38:12,736
Charlie, god is ready
to help you.

1405
01:38:12,771 --> 01:38:16,311
Oh, I hope
that there isn't a god,

1406
01:38:16,346 --> 01:38:19,050
because I hate to think
that there's an afterlife,

1407
01:38:19,085 --> 01:38:22,548
and that Alan can see
what I have done to myself.

1408
01:38:22,583 --> 01:38:25,650
- Charlie...
- That he can see my swollen feet

1409
01:38:25,685 --> 01:38:27,553
and the sores on my skin,

1410
01:38:27,588 --> 01:38:29,027
and the patches of mold

1411
01:38:29,062 --> 01:38:30,325
- in between the flaps.
- Stop.

1412
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,393
The infected ulcers on my ass,

1413
01:38:32,428 --> 01:38:36,100
and the sack of fat on my back
that turned brown last year.

1414
01:38:36,135 --> 01:38:38,102
- Okay, stop!
- This is disgusting?

1415
01:38:38,137 --> 01:38:40,203
- Yes!
- I'm disgusting?

1416
01:38:40,238 --> 01:38:42,106
Yes,
you're disgusting! You're...

1417
01:38:53,548 --> 01:38:55,317
I'm sorry.

1418
01:38:59,125 --> 01:39:00,125
What?

1419
01:39:03,459 --> 01:39:05,459
Go home to your family.

1420
01:39:54,675 --> 01:39:57,544
Well, your
complaints have been heard.

1421
01:39:58,382 --> 01:39:59,546
I've been replaced

1422
01:39:59,581 --> 01:40:01,713
by someone who will, no doubt,

1423
01:40:01,748 --> 01:40:05,189
have you rewrite,
and rewrite, and rewrite,

1424
01:40:05,653 --> 01:40:08,159
be more objective,

1425
01:40:08,821 --> 01:40:10,227
less authentic,

1426
01:40:10,262 --> 01:40:12,757
less you, with every draft.

1427
01:40:15,729 --> 01:40:19,434
But some of you saw my post

1428
01:40:19,469 --> 01:40:22,404
about writing something honest.

1429
01:40:25,739 --> 01:40:26,739
And...

1430
01:40:30,282 --> 01:40:32,084
The things
that some of you wrote...

1431
01:40:33,912 --> 01:40:35,351
Kristy, you wrote,

1432
01:40:36,453 --> 01:40:39,520
"my parents want me
to be a radiologist,

1433
01:40:39,555 --> 01:40:42,160
"but I don't even know
what that is."

1434
01:40:48,696 --> 01:40:50,234
Julian, you wrote,

1435
01:40:50,269 --> 01:40:53,567
"I'm sick of people telling me
that I have promise."

1436
01:41:01,379 --> 01:41:02,444
Adam, you wrote,

1437
01:41:03,612 --> 01:41:05,513
"I think I need to accept
that my life

1438
01:41:05,548 --> 01:41:07,878
"isn't going to be
very exciting."

1439
01:41:11,224 --> 01:41:15,589
You all wrote these
amazing, honest things, and...

1440
01:41:17,725 --> 01:41:19,824
You've been so honest
with me that I... I...

1441
01:41:25,502 --> 01:41:26,831
I just want to be...

1442
01:41:28,406 --> 01:41:29,801
Honest with you, too.

1443
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:13,713
<i>These assignments don't matter.</i>

1444
01:42:15,519 --> 01:42:16,749
<i>This course doesn't matter.</i>

1445
01:42:18,885 --> 01:42:20,225
<i>College doesn't matter.</i>

1446
01:42:22,559 --> 01:42:25,494
<i>These amazing, honest things
that you wrote,</i>

1447
01:42:29,533 --> 01:42:30,631
<i>They matter.</i>

1448
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:13,707
- I'm sorry.
- Don't.

1449
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:32,930
I really hate you for putting me
through this again, you know that?

1450
01:43:35,896 --> 01:43:37,434
Those last few months
before Alan...

1451
01:43:38,932 --> 01:43:41,438
I'd come over here,
shake him, scream at him,

1452
01:43:41,473 --> 01:43:43,473
just trying to get him
to fucking eat something.

1453
01:43:43,508 --> 01:43:46,036
- God, that was awful!
- It was awful for me, too.

1454
01:43:46,071 --> 01:43:47,444
Yeah? Well, you weren't the one

1455
01:43:47,479 --> 01:43:48,874
who had to identify his body,

1456
01:43:48,909 --> 01:43:50,612
- All bloated...
- They wouldn't let me.

1457
01:43:52,077 --> 01:43:53,483
I wasn't family.

1458
01:44:07,631 --> 01:44:09,730
I got you two meatball subs.
Extra cheese.

1459
01:44:16,871 --> 01:44:18,002
I don't know what I'm doing.

1460
01:44:26,749 --> 01:44:28,881
I'm not going to the hospital.

1461
01:44:28,916 --> 01:44:30,454
I'm not asking you to.

1462
01:44:35,857 --> 01:44:37,692
I can't do this anymore.

1463
01:44:40,796 --> 01:44:42,532
I tried to save him, Liz.

1464
01:44:45,801 --> 01:44:47,735
I thought
that if I just loved him,

1465
01:44:50,674 --> 01:44:52,476
that he wouldn't need
anyone else.

1466
01:44:55,448 --> 01:44:56,876
I told him he didn't need god,

1467
01:44:58,176 --> 01:45:01,518
he didn't need anyone but me.

1468
01:45:03,423 --> 01:45:04,423
Charlie,

1469
01:45:05,887 --> 01:45:07,689
all I know is that you gave Alan

1470
01:45:07,724 --> 01:45:08,954
the best years of his life.

1471
01:45:08,989 --> 01:45:10,571
If it weren't for you,
he would have jumped off

1472
01:45:10,595 --> 01:45:12,562
that bridge years earlier.

1473
01:45:13,158 --> 01:45:14,531
Nobody could've saved him.

1474
01:45:14,566 --> 01:45:16,434
Believe me,
I spent years trying.

1475
01:45:20,473 --> 01:45:23,067
I don't think I believe anyone
can save anyone.

1476
01:45:29,548 --> 01:45:30,613
She saved him.

1477
01:45:33,079 --> 01:45:37,180
She wasn't trying to hurt him.
She was trying to help him.

1478
01:45:37,215 --> 01:45:39,149
Who are you talking about?

1479
01:45:39,184 --> 01:45:41,624
He's going home. She did that.

1480
01:45:42,891 --> 01:45:44,990
- Charlie...
- She didn't do it to hurt him,

1481
01:45:45,795 --> 01:45:48,026
she did it to send him home.

1482
01:45:49,601 --> 01:45:51,931
Do you feel light-headed?
Charlie, look at me.

1483
01:45:51,966 --> 01:45:54,571
- She was trying to help him.
- Who?

1484
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:59,169
Ellie. She was trying
to help him,

1485
01:45:59,204 --> 01:46:01,105
she just wanted
to send him home.

1486
01:46:03,813 --> 01:46:07,650
Do you ever get
the feeling that...

1487
01:46:09,555 --> 01:46:12,919
People are incapable
of not caring?

1488
01:46:18,498 --> 01:46:19,926
People are amazing.

1489
01:46:23,635 --> 01:46:24,700
What the fuck did you do?

1490
01:46:27,837 --> 01:46:28,869
What's wrong with him?

1491
01:46:31,038 --> 01:46:32,038
He's dying.

1492
01:46:33,942 --> 01:46:35,612
So, call someone.

1493
01:46:35,647 --> 01:46:37,482
- No.
- Call a fucking ambulance!

1494
01:46:38,111 --> 01:46:39,111
Liz.

1495
01:46:40,113 --> 01:46:41,519
I need to talk to him.

1496
01:46:41,554 --> 01:46:42,795
I'm not leaving you
alone with him.

1497
01:46:42,819 --> 01:46:44,247
I need to talk to him alone.

1498
01:46:44,282 --> 01:46:45,490
Liz.

1499
01:46:48,286 --> 01:46:49,527
Please.

1500
01:46:54,094 --> 01:46:55,094
Okay.

1501
01:47:12,849 --> 01:47:13,980
I'll call someone.

1502
01:47:16,919 --> 01:47:17,919
Charlie.

1503
01:47:21,055 --> 01:47:22,659
I'll wait downstairs.

1504
01:47:30,130 --> 01:47:32,130
- Why'd you do that?
- What?

1505
01:47:34,574 --> 01:47:35,574
I failed.

1506
01:47:36,202 --> 01:47:37,806
It's a really good essay.

1507
01:47:37,841 --> 01:47:40,776
Are you just trying to
screw me over one last time?

1508
01:47:40,811 --> 01:47:42,822
I don't care about you!
I don't care that you're dying.

1509
01:47:42,846 --> 01:47:44,186
Do you want me to fail
out of high school?

1510
01:47:44,210 --> 01:47:46,177
- Is that why you did this?
- I didn't write it.

1511
01:47:46,212 --> 01:47:48,718
This is the essay
that you gave me yesterday.

1512
01:47:48,753 --> 01:47:50,588
- You didn't read it.
- I don't need to read it.

1513
01:47:51,052 --> 01:47:52,052
Read it.

1514
01:48:03,669 --> 01:48:04,669
This is...

1515
01:48:06,067 --> 01:48:07,605
I know what this is.

1516
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:09,706
I knew you would.

1517
01:48:10,775 --> 01:48:11,775
I wrote this.

1518
01:48:14,042 --> 01:48:15,778
You never forget anything.

1519
01:48:15,813 --> 01:48:18,682
I wrote this in eighth grade
for English. Why do you...

1520
01:48:18,717 --> 01:48:20,783
"And I felt saddest of all

1521
01:48:20,818 --> 01:48:23,049
"When I read the boring chapters

1522
01:48:23,084 --> 01:48:25,920
"That were only descriptions
of whales,

1523
01:48:25,955 --> 01:48:28,956
"Because I knew that

1524
01:48:28,991 --> 01:48:32,630
"The author
was just trying to save us

1525
01:48:32,665 --> 01:48:34,929
"From his own sad story,

1526
01:48:36,933 --> 01:48:38,801
"Just for a little while."

1527
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:43,300
- How do you have this?
- Your mother,

1528
01:48:43,335 --> 01:48:45,368
She sent it to me
four years ago.

1529
01:48:45,403 --> 01:48:48,140
I wanted to know
how you were doing in school,

1530
01:48:48,175 --> 01:48:49,944
and she sent it.

1531
01:48:49,979 --> 01:48:53,211
And it's the best essay
I've ever read.

1532
01:48:53,246 --> 01:48:55,126
Why are you
fucking with me like this?

1533
01:48:55,919 --> 01:48:56,919
I'm not.

1534
01:48:57,987 --> 01:49:01,351
I'm sorry for leaving you.

1535
01:49:03,696 --> 01:49:07,093
I was in love, and...

1536
01:49:07,128 --> 01:49:08,996
I left you behind.

1537
01:49:10,934 --> 01:49:14,298
- You did not deserve that.
- I don't...

1538
01:49:14,333 --> 01:49:16,773
I don't know how

1539
01:49:16,808 --> 01:49:18,709
I could have done such a thing.

1540
01:49:18,744 --> 01:49:21,008
You're so beautiful.

1541
01:49:21,043 --> 01:49:22,944
- You're amazing.
- Stop.

1542
01:49:25,245 --> 01:49:27,982
You're amazing.

1543
01:49:28,820 --> 01:49:30,952
This essay is amazing.

1544
01:49:32,725 --> 01:49:35,187
This essay is you.

1545
01:49:35,222 --> 01:49:36,353
Stop saying that.

1546
01:49:36,388 --> 01:49:39,994
- This essay is you.
- Stop saying that!

1547
01:49:40,029 --> 01:49:43,129
You're the best thing
I have ever done.

1548
01:49:44,737 --> 01:49:46,836
What's the matter?

1549
01:49:46,871 --> 01:49:47,903
Ellie!

1550
01:49:47,938 --> 01:49:49,872
No. Okay, I can't
be here right now.

1551
01:49:49,907 --> 01:49:51,269
- I have to go.
- You're perfect.

1552
01:49:51,876 --> 01:49:53,007
You'll be happy.

1553
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:57,209
You care about people.

1554
01:49:57,244 --> 01:49:58,884
The ambulance is coming,
they'll help you.

1555
01:49:58,916 --> 01:50:00,344
No. They won't.

1556
01:50:00,379 --> 01:50:03,248
- You're going to the hospital.
- No.

1557
01:50:03,283 --> 01:50:05,316
You just need surgery,
or something!

1558
01:50:05,351 --> 01:50:09,287
- Read it to me.
- What?

1559
01:50:09,322 --> 01:50:12,829
If you want
to help, read it to me.

1560
01:50:13,832 --> 01:50:16,800
You'll help if you read it.

1561
01:50:16,835 --> 01:50:19,099
You asshole.
You fat fucking asshole!

1562
01:50:19,134 --> 01:50:20,166
- You'll help...
- Fuck you.

1563
01:50:20,201 --> 01:50:21,464
- Please.
- Fuck you!

1564
01:50:21,499 --> 01:50:22,773
