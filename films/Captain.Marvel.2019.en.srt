1
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:16,762
Do you know what time it is?

2
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,389
Can't sleep.

3
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,433
There are tabs for that.

4
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,643
Yeah, but then I'd be sleeping.

5
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,729
Dreams again?

6
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,568
Wanna fight?

7
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,114
I slipped.

8
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:36,365
Right, you slipped

9
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:38,075
as a result of me punching you in the face.

10
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,201
I was already slipping

11
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:40,328
when you happened to punch me in the face.

12
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:41,912
The two events were not related.

13
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,622
Tell me about this dream.

14
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,669
- Anything new? - No.

15
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,467
You have to let go of the past.

16
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,801
I don't remember my past.

17
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,470
It's causing you doubt,

18
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,305
and doubt makes you vulnerable.

19
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,564
Control it.

20
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,318
Lose control again, and you'll have to commune

21
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,819
with the Supreme Intelligence.

22
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,822
There's nothing more dangerous to a warrior than emotion.

23
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,952
Humor is a distraction.

24
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,123
And anger?

25
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,750
Anger only serves the enemy.

26
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,471
One hundred twenty days

27
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,431
since the last Skrull attack.

28
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:43,933
Has anyone ever seen

29
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,643
what the Supreme Intelligence really looks like?

30
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,437
No one can look upon the Supreme Intelligence

31
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:49,855
in its true form.

32
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,149
You know that.

33
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,486
Our subconscious chooses the way they appear to us.

34
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:58,906
So it's sacred. It's personal.

35
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,908
No Kree divulges it, ever.

36
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:02,243
Who do you see?

37
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,286
- Your brother? - No.

38
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,621
- Father? - No.

39
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:07,832
- Your old commander? - Vers.

40
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,250
It's me you see, isn't it?

41
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,086
I see what you're trying to do.

42
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:13,671
- Is it working? - Yes.

43
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:15,506
But you won't succeed in changing the subject.

44
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:18,008
What is the point of giving me these...

45
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,885
if you don't want me to use them?

46
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,720
I want you to use them.

47
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,597
The Supreme Intelligence gave me a responsibility...

48
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,558
of showing you how to use them.

49
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:26,725
I know how.

50
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:27,852
Yeah, if that were true, you'd be able to

51
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:28,936
knock me down without them.

52
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,690
Control your impulses.

53
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,110
Stop using this, start using this.

54
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:40,865
I want you to be the best version of yourself.

55
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:23,073
Vers.

56
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,659
Intelligence.

57
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:28,954
Your commander insists that you're fit to serve.

58
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,164
I am.

59
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,667
You struggle with your emotions...

60
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,670
with your past, which fuels them.

61
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,425
You are just one victim of the Skrull expansion...

62
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,678
that has threatened our civilization for centuries.

63
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,765
Imposters who silently infiltrate...

64
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:49,934
then take over our planets.

65
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,395
Horrors that you remember...

66
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,106
and so much that you do not.

67
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,447
It's all blank. My life.

68
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,157
You're supposed to take the form

69
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:06,909
of who I most admire...

70
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:11,455
but I don't even remember who this person was to me.

71
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,624
Perhaps this is a mercy

72
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,043
sparing you from a deeper pain.

73
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,505
Freeing you to do what all Kree must...

74
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,841
put your people's needs before your own.

75
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,386
We've given you a great gift.

76
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:28,097
The chance to fight for the good of all Kree.

77
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:30,683
I want to serve.

78
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,810
Then master yourself.

79
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:35,563
What was given can be taken away.

80
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:40,985
I won't let you down.

81
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,195
We'll know soon enough.

82
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,281
You have a mission.

83
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:49,118
Serve well, and with honor.

84
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,473
This can't be good.

85
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,475
Must be another Skrull attack.

86
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,102
Whatever it is, it's big.

87
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:17,354
Has a Skrull ever simmed you?

88
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:18,564
Once.

89
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:20,899
- It was deeply disturbing. - Why?

90
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,277
Because I stared into the face of my mortal enemy...

91
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,321
and the face staring back was my own.

92
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:26,905
Maybe if you were more attractive,

93
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,365
then it would be less disturbing.

94
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,492
You think you're funny, but I'm not laughing.

95
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,785
You never laugh.

96
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,455
I laugh on the inside.

97
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,123
I'm not doing that now.

98
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,416
It's funny 'cause, objectively speaking,

99
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,584
you're quite handsome.

100
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,835
Well, thank you.

101
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,087
Listen up, team. Knock it off.

102
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,547
All right.

103
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,383
Prepare for...

104
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,095
a search and rescue of our spy, Soh-Larr.

105
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,474
The Skrulls have invaded yet another border planet.

106
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:55,434
This time, Torfa.

107
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:56,602
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.

108
00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:00,105
The signal was intercepted, and his cover's blown.

109
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,484
The Skrull general, Talos,

110
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,235
has sent kill units to find him.

111
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,945
Should they reach him before we do...

112
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,280
the intelligence he's acquired

113
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:10,074
over three years is as good as theirs.

114
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,910
The Accusers will bomb

115
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,953
a Skrull stronghold here in the south.

116
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,873
We slip in, we locate Soh-Larr...

117
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,460
and we get out, leaving them none the wiser.

118
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,212
The Torfan populace.

119
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,255
We are not to interfere with them,

120
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,382
nor them with us.

121
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,843
Nothing compromises the security of our mission.

122
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,679
Proceed with caution.

123
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,223
Follow protocol before extracting him.

124
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,393
This is a dangerous mission.

125
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,396
We must all be ready to join the Collective

126
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,897
if that is our fate today.

127
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,065
For the good of all Kree.

128
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,233
For the good of all Kree!

129
00:08:44,233 --> 00:09:14,233
Subtitle www.movieddl.me

130
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,972
Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.

131
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,767
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva, find elevation.

132
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,120
Locals on the periphery.

133
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,206
Maybe a dozen.

134
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:23,791
Minn-Erva?

135
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,086
Do you read me? Does anybody copy?

136
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,005
Repeat.

137
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,604
His beacon's coming from that temple. Let's move.

138
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,565
No. This is a perfect spot for an ambush.

139
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:49,858
Only one way in, only one way out.

140
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,527
We can get past the locals.

141
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,279
We don't know if they are locals. Too risky.

142
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,531
You don't have to go with me. I'll go alone.

143
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:56,698
No, you won't.

144
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,705
Right. We keep a close radius.

145
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,916
We lose comms, we meet back at the Helion.

146
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,210
Come on.

147
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,807
Att-Lass, you getting this?

148
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,350
Copy. I see them.

149
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,570
Get back!

150
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,280
Commander?

151
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,123
Get back! Back!

152
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,501
Minn-Erva? Do you have eyes on this?

153
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,170
Keep them back. Minn-Erva?

154
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,548
Does anybody copy?

155
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,012
I don't wanna hurt you.

156
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,807
Keep back!

157
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,312
Stay back!

158
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,860
They're locals. I found two dead. No green.

159
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,653
They're just starving.

160
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,722
HGX-78.

161
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,642
TRT79-VVX6.

162
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,146
Get back.

163
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,447
Skrulls!

164
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,132
Vers!

165
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,385
Vers? Skrulls.

166
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,387
It's an ambush.

167
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,407
Incoming!

168
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,038
Back to the Helion.

169
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:51,581
Vers. Do you copy?

170
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,167
Back to the Helion.

171
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,460
Come in. Vers.

172
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,295
How did you know the code?

173
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,340
How about I tell you my secret...

174
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,386
when you've told me yours?

175
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,433
Let's open her up.

176
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,822
Where are we?

177
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,407
Stand by.

178
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:28,410
Where's your head at?

179
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,621
In the clouds. Where's yours?

180
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,373
On my shoulders.

181
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,083
About to show these boys how we do it.

182
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,626
You ready?

183
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,711
Higher, further, faster, baby.

184
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:38,795
That's right.

185
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,182
This can't be right.

186
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,435
Go back even further.

187
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:00,108
You're going too fast! You need to go slow!

188
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,166
Who is this person? Are we in the right...?

189
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,375
What the hell are you thinking?

190
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,460
You don't belong out here!

191
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:19,961
I think we went back too far.

192
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,463
You let him drive.

193
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,006
Let me try something.

194
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,593
Give up already!

195
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,386
You don't belong out here!

196
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,891
You're not strong enough.

197
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,392
You'll kill yourself.

198
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:41,775
They'll never let you fly.

199
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,277
Am I the only one that's confused here?

200
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,571
You're a decent pilot.

201
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:47,739
But you're too emotional.

202
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,617
You do know why they call it a cockpit, don't you?

203
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,336
A huge rumble throughout the cosmos shook the moon...

204
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,464
and the sun and the stars in the sky.

205
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,674
And so,

206
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,509
little Alouette flew up throughout the night.

207
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,387
Did you see her? It's Alouette.

208
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,932
Get your butts inside, it's time to eat.

209
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,268
Prepare for takeoff, Lieutenant Trouble.

210
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,561
Charming memory.

211
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:18,728
Hang on.

212
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,272
I think I've got it.

213
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,403
Goose likes you.

214
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,946
She doesn't typically take to people.

215
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,447
Early start to your morning.

216
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,740
Uh, late night, actually.

217
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,826
I can't sleep when there's work to do.

218
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:33,994
Sound familiar?

219
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,662
Flying your planes never feels like work.

220
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,623
Wonderful view, isn't it?

221
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,625
I prefer the view from up there.

222
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:41,960
You'll get there soon enough, Ace.

223
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,212
Wait! Wait, wait! That's her. Get her back.

224
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,006
Stand by.

225
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:50,844
Sound familiar?

226
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,512
Wonderful view, isn't it?

227
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,391
I prefer the view from up there.

228
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:57,684
You'll get there soon enough, Ace.

229
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:58,894
What's that on her shirt?

230
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,228
I couldn't read it.

231
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,607
Wonderful view, isn't it?

232
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,944
I prefer the view from up there.

233
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,864
- Focus. - Excuse me?

234
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,699
Look down.

235
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,743
Focus.

236
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,579
"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson. " That's her.

237
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:18,747
Do you hear that, too?

238
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,248
Do we have her location?

239
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,376
Got it.

240
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,338
Now track Lawson until we find the energy signature.

241
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,260
Interesting.

242
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,847
Huh. Hold on.

243
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,142
Go back right before this. Go back.

244
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,437
That's no MiG, Lawson.

245
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,940
This is it. Now let me see where you're headed.

246
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,609
That's right. Look at the coordinates.

247
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,694
Focus.

248
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,864
Open, please.

249
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,532
That's it. That's it.

250
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:55,909
You're almost there.

251
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,619
You're almost there. Don't fight it.

252
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,538
Focus!

253
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:03,917
Get her back! Get her back now!

254
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:09,923
This doesn't make any sense.

255
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:28,483
Do we have any information we can act on?

256
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,861
Just that Lawson was somewhere on planet C-53.

257
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,029
We're on our way.

258
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,948
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

259
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:39,244
Lawson is our link to that light-speed engine!

260
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,871
And everything we're after.

261
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:50,588
Oh!

262
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,757
That did something.

263
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,217
Try that again.

264
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:06,855
Not yet!

265
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,782
What did you do to me?

266
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,327
Now we're just after a little information.

267
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,953
What did you put in my head?

268
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,997
Nothing that wasn't already there.

269
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,958
But those aren't my memories.

270
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,627
Yeah, it's like a bad trip, isn't it?

271
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,005
I'm not surprised you can't keep it straight.

272
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,257
They really did a number on you.

273
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,467
Enough of your mind games.

274
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,135
What do you want?

275
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,681
We're looking for the location of a Dr. Lawson...

276
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,391
and her light-speed engine.

277
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,226
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

278
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,938
Really? Then why is she in your head?

279
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:20,970
You guys wouldn't happen to know

280
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,055
how these things come off, would ya?

281
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,681
No?

282
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,100
Fine.

283
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:48,957
Hmm.

284
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,901
Hey.

285
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:04,491
You do know why they call it a...

286
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:23,801
You leaving so soon?

287
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,221
We're just getting to know each other.

288
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,682
Vers to Starforce command, do you read me?

289
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,520
Hello? Do you copy?

290
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,885
Hi. I'm Vers. Kree Starforce.

291
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,219
Is this C-53?

292
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,350
Do you understand me? Is my universal translator working?

293
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,518
Yeah. I understand you.

294
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,020
Oh, good.

295
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:40,980
Are you in charge of security for this district?

296
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,568
Sort of. Uh, the movie theater has its own guy.

297
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,905
Where can I find communications equipment?

298
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,163
Thank you.

299
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:32,198
Track the pod. Find the girl.

300
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:35,743
She knows more than she knows.

301
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,163
Hey.

302
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:41,791
This one's taken.

303
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:53,594
Come on.

304
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,179
Vers?

305
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,431
Vers?

306
00:25:57,265 --> 00:25:59,100
Verify. CTC-39.

307
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,435
GRXV-1600.

308
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:01,811
And I'm fine, thank you for asking.

309
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:04,313
Is everyone okay? What happened?

310
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,274
Skrull ambush.

311
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:07,984
I thought we'd lost you.

312
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,193
Did you find Soh-Larr?

313
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,570
It wasn't Soh-Larr.

314
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,655
Talos simmed him. Even knew his code.

315
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:14,949
That's impossible.

316
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:16,951
That code was buried in his unconscious.

317
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,411
The Skrulls messed with my mind.

318
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,579
The machine that they used...

319
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,622
I think it's how they extracted Soh-Larr's code.

320
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,207
Vers, where are you?

321
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,834
I'm on planet C-53.

322
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,962
The Skrulls are looking for someone named Lawson.

323
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,464
Who?

324
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,759
She's who I see.

325
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,552
She's what?

326
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,554
Vers?

327
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:38,639
Vers, what?

328
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,267
She's a scientist.

329
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,269
They think that she's cracked the code on light-speed tech.

330
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,021
I have to get to her before they do...

331
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:46,647
or else they'll be able to invade new galaxies.

332
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,566
No. You've been caught once already.

333
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,319
How far is C-53?

334
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,489
Closest jump point is 22 hours.

335
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,657
Vers, hold your position until we get there.

336
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,743
Keep your comms online so we can contact you.

337
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,787
No! What if they get a hold of it before...

338
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,913
We're sorry.

339
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:03,039
A long-distance company access code

340
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,123
is required for the number you have dialed.

341
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,833
- Yon-Rogg? - Vers?

342
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,252
Vers?

343
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:09,712
Please dial your call with the access code.

344
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:10,880
Vers?

345
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,634
If the Skrulls got to her, she's compromised.

346
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,803
She's stronger than you think.

347
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,597
Ever been to C-53?

348
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,349
Once.

349
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,227
It's a real shithole.

350
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:37,615
Hey, rookie! Go talk to the rent-a-cop.

351
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,249
Did you call this in?

352
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:01,931
Beacon activated.

353
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:06,727
Excuse me, miss.

354
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:09,272
You know anything about a lady blowing a hole...

355
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,608
through the roof of that Blockbuster over there?

356
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:15,403
Witness says she was dressed for laser tag.

357
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:17,905
Oh.

358
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:20,241
Yeah, I think she went that way.

359
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:23,953
Uh, I'd like to ask you some questions.

360
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:28,124
Maybe give you the 411 on the late-night drop box.

361
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,293
Could I see some identification, please?

362
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:32,211
Vers. Kree Starforce.

363
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:33,337
We don't carry our identification

364
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:34,422
on little cards.

365
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:35,506
Vers?

366
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,134
Starforce?

367
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,928
How long you plan to be in town?

368
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:42,138
Oh, I'll be out of your hair...

369
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:43,556
as soon as I track down the Skrulls

370
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,349
that are infiltrating your planet.

371
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,560
Skrulls?

372
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,145
Shapeshifters?

373
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:52,356
They can transform into any life-form down to the DNA.

374
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,443
Oh, boy. You guys don't have any clue, do you?

375
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

376
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:04,118
How do we know you're not one of those shapeshifters?

377
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:06,078
Congratulations, Agent Fury.

378
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,164
You have finally asked a relevant question.

379
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:11,292
No! Congratulations to you, Starforce lady.

380
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,544
You're under arrest.

381
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,595
Rook!

382
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,722
Rook, let's roll!

383
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,566
Did you see her weapon?

384
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,777
I did not.

385
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:47,912
Watch it!

386
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,947
Suspect on northbound train. In pursuit.

387
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,762
"Trust me, true believer." "Trust me."

388
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,936
"Trust me, true believer."

389
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:41,067
Get off!

390
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,541
Train's heading for a tunnel up ahead.

391
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,546
Let's greet them at the station.

392
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:57,101
Mr. Fury, this is Agent Coulson.

393
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,146
Uh, I'm still here at the Blockbuster.

394
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:03,482
And, uh, where'd everybody go?

395
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:05,985
I finished collecting evidence...

396
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,491
We need an ambulance!

397
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:36,825
Someone call 911!

398
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,494
Hey! You all right?

399
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,496
Oh, my gosh! Is everyone okay?

400
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:41,664
Anyone else see that?

401
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,750
Official S.H.I.E.L.D. activity. Stay back.

402
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,134
Nice scuba suit.

403
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,474
Lighten up, honey, huh?

404
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,476
Got a smile for me?

405
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:49,898
Freak.

406
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:12,671
All life on Earth is carbon-based. Not this guy.

407
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,466
Whatever he runs on,

408
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:16,842
it's not on the periodic table.

409
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,595
You're saying he's not from around here?

410
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:21,680
Hey, how's your eye?

411
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,850
Well, I'd say fine...

412
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:27,436
but it can't believe what it's seeing.

413
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:35,110
You say this thing looked like Coulson?

414
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,112
Mmm. Talked like him, too.

415
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,990
And the woman said that there were more?

416
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:42,076
The word she used was "infiltration."

417
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:43,285
You believe her?

418
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:44,995
Not till I saw this.

419
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,290
What's your plan?

420
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,709
I'll find Blockbuster girl.

421
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,045
I got word on a motorcycle thief

422
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,463
that fits her description.

423
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,341
If she can tell us why these lizards are here...

424
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,094
maybe she can tell us how to kick 'em to the curb.

425
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,261
Good.

426
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,057
Do it alone, though. We can't trust anyone.

427
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:08,185
Not even our own men.

428
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:09,603
Yes, sir.

429
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:26,829
Wow. They're ugly bastards, aren't they?

430
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:30,791
Yeah, well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.

431
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:38,090
Safe journey to the beyond, my friend.

432
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,928
I will finish what we started.

433
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,522
I wouldn't get too close there, boss.

434
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:57,234
No one in or out.

435
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,062
Boom!

436
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:00,464
What can I get ya?

437
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:02,382
Where was this photograph taken?

438
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:04,426
An airport.

439
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:05,844
Where's Pegasus?

440
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:07,596
That's classified.

441
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,308
Not unlike the file I started on you.

442
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,521
But I see you've changed it up a bit since then.

443
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,314
Grunge is a good look for you.

444
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:18,982
Did you have a rough day, Agent Fury?

445
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,609
It was cool, you know?

446
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:23,570
Had a space invasion, big car chase.

447
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:27,199
Got to watch an alien autopsy.

448
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,243
Typical nine-to-five.

449
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:30,452
So you saw one?

450
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:33,330
I was never one to believe in aliens...

451
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,250
but I can't unsee that.

452
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,044
This is gonna get a little awkward, but I gotta ask.

453
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,505
You think I'm one of those green things.

454
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:42,965
Can't be too careful.

455
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:47,886
You are looking at 100% red-blooded Earth man.

456
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:49,346
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

457
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:51,473
We talking cheek swab or urine sample?

458
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,350
No. The DNA would match.

459
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:54,601
Want my AOL password?

460
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,770
Skrulls can only sim recent memories

461
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,855
- of their host bodies. - Oh, oh.

462
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,567
You wanna get personal.

463
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:03,694
- Where were you born? - Huntsville, Alabama.

464
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,237
But technically, I don't remember that part.

465
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:06,822
- Name of your first pet? - Mr. Snoofers.

466
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:08,282
- Mr. Snoofers? - That's what I said.

467
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:09,366
Do I pass?

468
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:10,784
Not yet. First job?

469
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:12,703
Soldier. Straight out of high school.

470
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:13,954
Left the ranks a full bird colonel.

471
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:15,163
- Then? - Spy.

472
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,415
- Where? - It was the Cold War.

473
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:17,624
We were everywhere.

474
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:20,460
Uh, Belfast. Bucharest. Belgrade. Budapest.

475
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,129
I like the B's. I can make them rhyme.

476
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:23,422
- Now? - Been riding a desk

477
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:24,506
for the past six years...

478
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:25,674
trying to figure out where our

479
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:26,758
future enemies are coming from.

480
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:28,010
Never occurred to me

481
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,345
they would be coming from above.

482
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:31,847
Name a detail so bizarre

483
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,223
a Skrull could never fabricate it.

484
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:39,313
If toast is cut diagonally, I can't eat it.

485
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,691
You didn't need that, did you?

486
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,526
No. No, I didn't. But I enjoyed it.

487
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:46,778
Okay. Your turn.

488
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,614
Prove you're not a Skrull.

489
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,750
And how is that supposed to prove to me

490
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,043
you're not a Skrull?

491
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,461
That's a photon blast.

492
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:03,920
And?

493
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:05,005
A Skrull can't do that.

494
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:07,257
So, a full bird colonel

495
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:08,467
turned spy turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...

496
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:11,136
must have pretty high security clearance.

497
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:12,763
Where's Pegasus?

498
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:21,355
Okay. The Skrulls sim alien races

499
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:23,190
to infiltrate and take over planets.

500
00:41:23,357 --> 00:41:27,402
And you're a Kree? A race of noble warriors?

501
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:30,072
Heroes. Noble warrior heroes.

502
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:33,825
So, um, what do Skrulls want with Dr. Lawson?

503
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,953
They believe that she developed

504
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:38,872
a light-speed engine at Pegasus.

505
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,582
Light-speed engine?

506
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,001
Gotta admit, that's not

507
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:44,378
the craziest thing I've heard today.

508
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,129
Well, it's still early.

509
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,215
And you, what do you want?

510
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:50,676
To stop the Skrulls before they become unstoppable.

511
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:51,760
And?

512
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:59,226
Look, war is a universal language.

513
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:02,104
I know a rogue soldier when I see one.

514
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,523
You got a personal stake in this.

515
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:16,326
This is government property.

516
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,245
Turn your vehicle around.

517
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:21,456
Nicholas Joseph Fury. Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

518
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,792
Place your thumb on the pad.

519
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:26,128
One moment.

520
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:30,257
Nicholas Joseph Fury. You have three names?

521
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,384
Everybody calls me Fury.

522
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:36,430
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph. Not Nick. Just Fury.

523
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,014
- What does your mom call you? - Fury.

524
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,683
- What do you call her? - Fury.

525
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:40,892
What about your kids?

526
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,811
If I have them, they'll call me Fury.

527
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,187
You are cleared for access.

528
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:45,272
Thank you.

529
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:16,511
Oh, hold up.

530
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,723
You look like somebody's disaffected niece.

531
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:22,726
Put that on.

532
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,146
- What is it? - It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.

533
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:28,982
Does, uh, announcing your identity on clothing

534
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,567
help with the covert part of your job?

535
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:32,986
Said the space soldier who was wearing a rubber suit.

536
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,238
Lose the flannel.

537
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:47,667
How can I help you?

538
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,378
We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

539
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:54,758
We're looking for a woman named Lawson.

540
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:57,177
A Dr. Wendy Lawson.

541
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,222
Do you know her?

542
00:44:04,518 --> 00:44:05,769
Follow me.

543
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:07,437
Hmm.

544
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:13,401
You familiar with the phrase "welcome wagon"?

545
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:15,403
No.

546
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:18,990
Well, this ain't it.

547
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:27,374
Is that a communicator?

548
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:30,836
Yeah. State-of-the-art two-way pager.

549
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,087
Who are you paging?

550
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:35,924
My mom. Don't worry. I didn't mention you.

551
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:15,547
After you.

552
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:17,340
Impressive.

553
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:20,218
Oh, you should see what I can do with a paperclip.

554
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:33,189
Hey, there. How are you?

555
00:45:35,025 --> 00:45:37,819
Oh, my goodness. Look at you. Just look at you.

556
00:45:38,028 --> 00:45:40,405
Aren't you the cutest little thing?

557
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:42,782
Aren't you cute? And what's your name, huh?

558
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:43,867
What's your name?

559
00:45:44,034 --> 00:45:46,828
"Goose." Cool name for a cool cat.

560
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:47,913
Fury?

561
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,247
Hmm?

562
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:52,709
I'll be back.

563
00:45:56,046 --> 00:45:58,173
Oh! Let me get my fingerprint out.

564
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,841
Just let me unravel this puppy.

565
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:06,431
You sat there and watched me play with tape?

566
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:07,599
When all you had to do was...

567
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:09,267
I didn't wanna steal your thunder.

568
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:28,453
Huh. Lawson.

569
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:41,633
Lawson's plan for the light-speed engine.

570
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:44,427
I wonder why they terminated the project.

571
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:49,557
Um, maybe because she's cuckoo.

572
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,311
Kree glyphs?

573
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:54,854
Hmm?

574
00:46:56,189 --> 00:46:57,816
Lawson is not cuckoo.

575
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,778
She's Kree.

576
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,364
Well, she's dead.

577
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:05,991
What?

578
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,826
She crashed the Asis aircraft

579
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,786
doing an unauthorized test flight.

580
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:11,955
Took a pilot down with her.

581
00:47:12,122 --> 00:47:14,290
That's why security here is so unfriendly.

582
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:17,502
They're covering up a billion-dollar mistake.

583
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:21,798
Oh, and your light-speed engine is toast.

584
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:26,845
When did this crash happen?

585
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:30,682
Six years ago. 1989.

586
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,268
Who was the pilot?

587
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:37,272
Um, most of this thing's redacted...

588
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:41,568
but there is a testimonial here from a Maria Rambeau.

589
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,820
Last person to see them alive.

590
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:50,326
You okay?

591
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,288
Mm-hmm.

592
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:56,166
Back in a minute.

593
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,114
This isn't about fighting wars.

594
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:30,033
It's about ending them.

595
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,582
I know Lawson was Kree.

596
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:40,668
She was here on C-53 and died in a plane crash.

597
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:43,505
Do you know anything about this?

598
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,256
I just discovered a mission report

599
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,966
sent from C-53.

600
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:48,176
There's only so much

601
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,887
I'm cleared to tell you, Vers, but...

602
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:58,728
Lawson was an undercover Kree operative named Mar-Vell.

603
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:02,482
She was working on a unique energy core.

604
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:03,942
Experimenting with tech

605
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:06,861
that apparently could help us win the war.

606
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:14,869
She still here?

607
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:17,497
She's cooperating with the investigation, sir.

608
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,624
- You men stay here. - Yes, sir.

609
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,668
I want to question her alone.

610
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:25,630
Excellent work, Nicholas.

611
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:31,177
Does it say anything about me?

612
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:33,012
Anything about you? No, of course not.

613
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,180
Why would it?

614
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:37,475
I found evidence that I had a life here.

615
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:39,269
On C-53?

616
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:43,064
Mar-Vell is who I see

617
00:49:43,148 --> 00:49:44,524
when I visit the Supreme Intelligence.

618
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:47,861
I knew her. And I knew her as Lawson.

619
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:50,280
This sounds like Skrull simulation, Vers.

620
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,240
No, it's not. Because I remember. I was here.

621
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:54,159
Stop. Remember your training.

622
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,578
Know your enemy. It could be you.

623
00:49:56,744 --> 00:50:00,081
Do not let your emotions override your judgment.

624
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,251
She's on sublevel six.

625
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:04,794
I'll get off on five...

626
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:07,088
and take the stairs in case she makes a run for it.

627
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:11,134
Do a pincer move like we did in Havana.

628
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:14,304
Right. Like we did in Havana.

629
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:26,357
We're nearing the jump point.

630
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,067
Leave your beacon on so I can find you.

631
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:30,987
We'll get to the bottom of this, Vers.

632
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:32,780
Together.

633
00:50:35,325 --> 00:50:36,659
Okay.

634
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:55,845
Vers!

635
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:58,806
Vers!

636
00:51:15,657 --> 00:51:17,283
Fury's colluding with the target.

637
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:18,701
Then why would he call us in?

638
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:21,329
All I know is we take him in, too. Dead or alive.

639
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:22,789
Dead or alive?

640
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:38,930
Go. Go, go!

641
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:53,528
Was it something I said?

642
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:12,588
Mmm-mmm.

643
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:36,070
Now, you know, I don't really need these to see...

644
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:40,700
but they do kinda complete the look.

645
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:42,618
Don't you think?

646
00:53:00,178 --> 00:53:01,179
You called them in?

647
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:02,764
My bad.

648
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:18,821
Coulson, do you have eyes on them?

649
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:20,656
They're not down here.

650
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:23,117
Let's try up there.

651
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:33,628
- What? - Your communicator.

652
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:35,546
You obviously can't be trusted with it.

653
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:08,079
Do you know how to fly this thing?

654
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:09,247
Uh, we'll see.

655
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:10,915
That's a yes or no question.

656
00:54:14,961 --> 00:54:15,962
Yes.

657
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:21,050
That's what I'm talking about!

658
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:49,620
We got a stowaway.

659
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:54,834
Hang on, Goose.

660
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:01,048
Goose.

661
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,261
No, Goose.

662
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:09,765
Who's a good kitty, huh? Huh, Goose?

663
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,893
Yes, that's right.

664
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,895
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

665
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,563
You the good kitty, that's right.

666
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:16,814
See anyone you know?

667
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,067
Funny story.

668
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:23,905
I arrived on Hala near dead. No memory.

669
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:25,865
That was six years ago.

670
00:55:26,032 --> 00:55:28,201
So, you think you're the pilot

671
00:55:28,284 --> 00:55:29,452
that went down with Dr. Lawson?

672
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:32,038
I'm saying the last person to see them alive

673
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:33,122
could probably tell us.

674
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:34,874
- Maria Rambeau? - Mm-hmm.

675
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:36,792
So, how do we get to Louisiana?

676
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:40,254
Due east. Hang a right at Memphis.

677
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,674
That agent...

678
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:45,760
that stopped the Skrulls from finding us?

679
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:47,845
Coulson. The new guy.

680
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:49,263
I guess he doesn't hate me yet.

681
00:55:49,514 --> 00:55:51,182
Yeah, well, give him time.

682
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:54,810
I guess he had a feeling, you know?

683
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,146
Went with his gut against orders.

684
00:55:57,313 --> 00:55:58,648
That's a really hard thing to do.

685
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,733
But it's what keeps us human.

686
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,236
I get in trouble for that. A lot.

687
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:04,529
Oh, I can see that about you.

688
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:09,825
Rescuing the guy who sold you out to the Skrulls?

689
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:11,202
I'm guessing that's not

690
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,870
standard Kree operating procedure.

691
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:15,206
Well, I won't tell your boss if you don't tell mine.

692
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:24,465
Ronan.

693
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:26,509
The Accusers completed their operation...

694
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:28,094
but the greater mission was a failure,

695
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:29,262
thanks to your team.

696
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:30,930
It was a trap

697
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:33,641
to lure our operative Vers to Torfa and kidnap her.

698
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:35,059
Give us their location.

699
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,602
We'll take care of the terrorist threat.

700
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:39,063
By bombing them out of the galaxy?

701
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,774
No, we'll handle this.

702
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,026
A cell of Skrulls anywhere

703
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:46,070
is a threat to Kree everywhere.

704
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:47,280
Where are they?

705
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:49,073
- They are... - Lost.

706
00:56:50,241 --> 00:56:52,410
They are lost for now.

707
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:54,245
But we will find them.

708
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:57,957
Do so, or we will.

709
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,505
Maintain the course for C-53.

710
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,985
Excuse me, I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

711
00:57:28,154 --> 00:57:29,447
Auntie Carol?

712
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:31,532
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

713
00:57:32,742 --> 00:57:35,244
I knew it! Everyone said you were dead!

714
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:37,496
But we knew they were lying.

715
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:41,751
I'm not really who you think I am.

716
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,928
That is the craziest shit I ever heard.

717
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:56,098
Green transforming aliens? There's no such thing.

718
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:57,808
You are absolutely right, young lady.

719
00:57:57,892 --> 00:57:59,393
There is no such thing.

720
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,936
'Cause if there were,

721
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,481
we would want to keep that to ourselves.

722
00:58:03,648 --> 00:58:04,732
You don't believe me?

723
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:13,949
No way!

724
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:16,285
That's so cool!

725
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:17,953
Oh, she can do a lot more than make tea

726
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:19,163
with those hands.

727
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:20,373
Like what? Show us.

728
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:21,832
Maybe later.

729
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:24,335
I kept all your stuff.

730
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:25,670
I'll go get it.

731
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:28,255
You want to give her a hand with that?

732
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:29,632
Hmm?

733
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:46,565
You don't remember anything?

734
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:51,320
I see flashes.

735
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:53,864
Little moments.

736
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,367
But I can't tell what's real.

737
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:01,956
If I could just piece together what happened that morning...

738
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:04,792
maybe it'll all make sense.

739
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:11,132
You woke me up banging on my door at dawn.

740
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:12,842
Your usual move.

741
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,011
Back then, we had to get up so early.

742
00:59:16,512 --> 00:59:19,014
The Air Force still wasn't letting women fly combat...

743
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:21,726
so testing Lawson's planes was our only shot

744
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:23,018
at doing something that mattered.

745
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:25,938
You wanted to race to base in your old Mustang...

746
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:27,064
and I wasn't about to argue,

747
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:28,941
'cause I knew my Camaro would dominate.

748
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:31,235
But you cheated, took a shortcut.

749
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:32,945
Since when is a shortcut cheating?

750
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:34,155
Since it violates the predetermined

751
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:35,239
rules of engagement.

752
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:36,574
I definitely don't remember those.

753
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:38,367
Hmm. Of course you don't.

754
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:48,544
When I got to the hangar, Lawson was agitated.

755
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:51,756
She said she had lives to save.

756
00:59:52,715 --> 00:59:54,133
She was trying to take the Asis up herself,

757
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,259
but you said that...

758
00:59:55,426 --> 00:59:58,971
If there were lives at stake, I would fly the plane.

759
00:59:59,138 --> 01:00:03,392
Yeah. Yep. Big hero moment.

760
01:00:03,976 --> 01:00:06,979
The kind of moment we'd both been waiting for.

761
01:00:07,897 --> 01:00:11,484
The doc was always unique. That's why we liked her.

762
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:16,322
But now you're saying she's from another planet.

763
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,575
I know this must be hard for you.

764
01:00:19,742 --> 01:00:21,660
Oh, what? This part right here?

765
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:24,830
No. No. Mmm-mmm.

766
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:31,629
Oh, what's hard is losing my best friend...

767
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,464
in a mission so secret

768
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:35,633
they act like it never even happened.

769
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,222
Hard is knowing you were out there somewhere

770
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:43,182
too damn stubborn to die.

771
01:00:44,517 --> 01:00:47,269
And now you come up in here after six years...

772
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:49,313
with your supercharged fire hands...

773
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,856
and you expect me to call you...

774
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:53,275
I don't even know what. Vers?

775
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:56,987
Is that really who you are now?

776
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:01,033
I don't know.

777
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:07,665
Come look!

778
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:15,673
This is me and you on Halloween.

779
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,134
I'm Amelia Earhart and you're Janis Joplin.

780
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:20,803
Oh, this is you when you were little.

781
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:22,763
You didn't get along with your parents...

782
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,473
so Mom said we became your real family.

783
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,183
This is us on Christmas.

784
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,518
I got my favorite bunny slippers.

785
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:29,270
This is another picture of you when you were little.

786
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:30,437
You've always wanted to be a pilot.

787
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:31,605
And this is right after you graduated.

788
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:33,274
This was your dog that you got for Christmas...

789
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,109
This is a picture of everybody from your Air Force team.

790
01:01:35,276 --> 01:01:36,443
And this is you with Mom

791
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:37,695
right after a good day of training.

792
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:39,154
These were your three favorite guys.

793
01:01:41,532 --> 01:01:42,741
Oh, wait. I forgot.

794
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:44,326
Your jacket.

795
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:45,870
Mom doesn't let me wear it anymore

796
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:47,580
after I spilled ketchup on it.

797
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:03,220
That was all that survived the crash.

798
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:06,181
Or so we thought.

799
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:12,563
Don't answer that.

800
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,356
It's just my neighbor.

801
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:16,191
They can change into anyone.

802
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:22,531
Hi there.

803
01:02:22,907 --> 01:02:23,908
What do you want?

804
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,036
- Uh... - Hey, Tom.

805
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,621
This is my friend, Carol.

806
01:02:28,704 --> 01:02:30,080
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

807
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:33,459
Yowzers.

808
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:35,836
Static electricity out here's no joke.

809
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:39,298
I noticed that peculiar bird you got parked by the road...

810
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:40,466
and I was just wondering...

811
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:41,759
if you mind if I bring the boys over

812
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:42,927
to get a closer look-see?

813
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,346
- A closer look-see? - Yeah.

814
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:48,641
To see the "bird" parked out by the road?

815
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:49,975
Mmm.

816
01:02:50,059 --> 01:02:51,518
You're really working overtime

817
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:54,063
to sell this one, aren't you, Talos?

818
01:02:55,064 --> 01:02:57,650
I'm sorry, Tom. This really isn't a good time.

819
01:02:57,816 --> 01:02:59,234
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

820
01:02:59,568 --> 01:03:01,445
- Uh... - Okay.

821
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:06,992
You know, you really should be kinder to your neighbors.

822
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:08,827
You never know when you're gonna need

823
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,537
to borrow some sugar.

824
01:03:13,332 --> 01:03:15,417
Now, hang on a second.

825
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:19,046
Before you go swinging those jazz hands around...

826
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:22,174
making a mess of your friend's house...

827
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:24,218
It's a lovely home, miss.

828
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:25,552
Oh, my God!

829
01:03:26,095 --> 01:03:27,638
What the hell?

830
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:32,851
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

831
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:35,896
Just don't kill me.

832
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:37,856
That would really complicate the situation.

833
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:40,693
I'm about five seconds from complicating that wall

834
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:42,069
with some ugly-ass Skrull brains.

835
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:43,779
I'm sorry I simmed your boss.

836
01:03:43,946 --> 01:03:47,574
But now I stand before you as my true self.

837
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:48,742
Without deception.

838
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:50,244
And who is that out there?

839
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,455
Okay, that's a fair point...

840
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:55,332
but I'm sure that you understand

841
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:57,543
I had to take some precautions.

842
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:00,879
I saw you crush 20 of my best men

843
01:04:00,963 --> 01:04:02,006
with your hands bound.

844
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:03,298
I just wanna talk.

845
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:04,466
Last time we talked,

846
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:05,676
I ended up hanging from my ankles.

847
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:08,303
That was before I knew who you were.

848
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,598
Before I knew what made you different from the others.

849
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:14,768
I have an audio recording from Pegasus...

850
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:17,896
of your voice from a plane crash

851
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,398
six years ago...

852
01:04:19,565 --> 01:04:23,777
on a device I believe you call a "black box."

853
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,905
They told me it was destroyed in the crash.

854
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,073
How'd you get it?

855
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,241
She don't understand.

856
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:30,701
Young lady, I have a special skill...

857
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:32,327
that kind of allows me

858
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:34,455
to get into places I'm not supposed to be.

859
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:35,664
Call me "young lady" again...

860
01:04:35,831 --> 01:04:37,124
I'm gonna put my foot in a place

861
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:38,625
it's not supposed to be.

862
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:43,047
Am I supposed to guess where that is?

863
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,798
Your ass.

864
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:47,426
Okay, I get it. We're all a little on edge here.

865
01:04:47,593 --> 01:04:49,470
But, look, I just need your help

866
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:50,763
decoding some coordinates.

867
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,765
If you'll sit down and you'll listen to this...

868
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:56,101
I assure you, it'll be worth your while.

869
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:01,023
Call your buddy back inside and I'll listen.

870
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:02,649
Deal.

871
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:05,736
Oh, my God! Get that thing away.

872
01:05:05,903 --> 01:05:07,237
How'd that get in here?

873
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:08,447
Hmm?

874
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:10,824
The cat?

875
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:12,076
This isn't what you're afraid of, is it?

876
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:13,702
That's not a cat.

877
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:16,872
- That's a Flerken. - A Flerken?

878
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:18,582
Mom?

879
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,091
Monica.

880
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:28,801
- Why can't I listen, too? - Shh!

881
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,038
What's happening?

882
01:05:58,205 --> 01:05:59,790
It's loading.

883
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:04,920
Punch in the coordinates

884
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:09,383
5-2-2-9, negative 4-7, 8. 7-6-8, 0.2.

885
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:11,510
Copy that. Where are we going, Doc?

886
01:06:11,677 --> 01:06:13,053
My laboratory.

887
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:15,430
Your laboratory? What do you mean?

888
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:16,723
Oh, no.

889
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,892
Is that... Wait, what is that?

890
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:20,394
It's not showing up on my radar.

891
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:22,104
Go, Carol. Fly!

892
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:24,690
That's no MiG, Lawson. Who the hell are they?

893
01:06:24,857 --> 01:06:26,859
Those are the bad guys. Fly faster now!

894
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:27,943
Yes, ma'am.

895
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:36,160
- What do they want? - Me. My work.

896
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:37,870
I never should have brought you along.

897
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:44,084
Here come some G's.

898
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:05,355
They're firing backwards. Hold on!

899
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:18,035
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

900
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:23,081
Stay with me, Lawson!

901
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:42,684
Carol, come in. Do you copy?

902
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:45,270
Yeah, I copy. We hit ground.

903
01:07:45,437 --> 01:07:46,980
Carol, are you okay? Do you copy?

904
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:49,316
Yeah! I copy.

905
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:53,070
Doc?

906
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:55,530
Your blood.

907
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:57,991
It's blue.

908
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,370
Yeah, but, uh, how's my hair?

909
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:05,207
Help me out, will ya?

910
01:08:08,252 --> 01:08:11,296
I gotta destroy it before they get here.

911
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:12,547
Lawson?

912
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:16,718
You remember what I said about our work here? What it's for?

913
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:18,971
To end wars?

914
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:22,766
Yeah. But the wars are bigger than you know.

915
01:08:23,976 --> 01:08:25,435
Damn it!

916
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:28,021
My name is not Lawson.

917
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:31,525
My real name is Mar-Vell,

918
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,403
and I come from a planet called Hala.

919
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:37,781
I would say that you're delusional...

920
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,574
but we just got shot down by a spaceship

921
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:41,159
and your blood is blue.

922
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:45,872
Listen, I spent half my life fighting a shameful war.

923
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:47,874
Now, skedaddle before you give me

924
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:49,167
any more regrets.

925
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:51,420
Just remember the coordinates, okay?

926
01:08:52,004 --> 01:08:53,588
You gotta save 'em without me.

927
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:54,798
Save who? How?

928
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:57,843
Now I gotta blow this engine before they find it.

929
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:59,303
What are you doing?

930
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:21,325
We have no interest in hurting you.

931
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,035
No?

932
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:25,871
'Cause all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression!

933
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:28,874
The energy core.

934
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:30,959
Where is it?

935
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:32,836
Pararescue's on the way.

936
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,547
You have two minutes until you're surrounded.

937
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:38,508
Then I see no reason to prolong this conversation.

938
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:39,718
No, wait!

939
01:09:46,141 --> 01:09:47,517
You mean that energy core?

940
01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:53,190
No!

941
01:10:36,817 --> 01:10:40,195
Commander? She's still moving. Permission to fire.

942
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:41,363
Hold your fire.

943
01:10:51,373 --> 01:10:53,250
There's nothing left.

944
01:10:53,417 --> 01:10:55,085
The core has been destroyed.

945
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:06,680
She absorbed its power.

946
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:10,725
She's coming with us.

947
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,956
He lied to me.

948
01:11:35,584 --> 01:11:37,544
Everything that I knew was a lie.

949
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:40,213
Now, you understand.

950
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,883
What? What do I understand now?

951
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:44,926
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

952
01:11:45,093 --> 01:11:46,219
He killed her...

953
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:48,889
'cause she found out that she was

954
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:52,184
on the wrong side of an unjust war.

955
01:11:52,267 --> 01:11:53,310
No.

956
01:11:53,894 --> 01:11:56,021
Your people are terrorists.

957
01:11:56,188 --> 01:11:57,689
They kill innocents.

958
01:11:57,856 --> 01:11:59,608
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

959
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:03,028
Ruins that the Accusers are responsible for.

960
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:06,698
My people lived as refugees on Torfa.

961
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:10,452
Homeless, ever since we resisted Kree rule...

962
01:12:10,619 --> 01:12:12,621
and they destroyed our planet.

963
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:16,374
And the handful of us that are left

964
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:18,502
will be slaughtered next...

965
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:22,672
unless you help me finish what Mar-Vell started.

966
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:25,383
The core that she found

967
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:27,010
would have powered a light-speed ship...

968
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:28,970
capable of carrying us to safety.

969
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:33,099
A new home where the Kree can't reach us.

970
01:12:34,601 --> 01:12:36,937
Lawson always told us that our work at Pegasus

971
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,271
wasn't to fight wars...

972
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:39,439
but to end them.

973
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:45,612
She wanted you to help us find the core.

974
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:47,656
Well, I already destroyed it.

975
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:49,366
No, you destroyed the engine.

976
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:52,536
The core that powered it is in a remote location.

977
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:56,998
If you help us decode those coordinates...

978
01:12:57,165 --> 01:12:58,708
we can find it.

979
01:13:00,502 --> 01:13:02,128
You'll use it to destroy us.

980
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:07,384
We just want a home.

981
01:13:11,638 --> 01:13:16,851
You and I lost everything at the hands of the Kree.

982
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:18,853
Can't you see it now?

983
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,397
You're not one of them.

984
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:24,943
You don't know me.

985
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,780
You have no idea who I am.

986
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:33,159
I don't even know who I am!

987
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:36,746
You are Carol Danvers.

988
01:13:37,998 --> 01:13:40,125
You are the woman on that black box

989
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:42,752
risking her life to do the right thing.

990
01:13:44,546 --> 01:13:46,298
My best friend...

991
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:49,384
who supported me as a mother and a pilot

992
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:50,927
when no one else did.

993
01:13:51,553 --> 01:13:56,641
You are smart, and funny, and a huge pain in the ass...

994
01:13:56,808 --> 01:14:00,061
and you were the most powerful person I knew...

995
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:03,315
way before you could shoot fire from your fists.

996
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:05,483
You hear me?

997
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,695
Do you hear me?

998
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:17,954
Come here. Come here, girl.

999
01:14:18,622 --> 01:14:20,040
I got you.

1000
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:27,297
I know I don't deserve your trust...

1001
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:29,674
but you were our only lead.

1002
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:32,093
We discovered that your energy signature

1003
01:14:32,177 --> 01:14:34,929
matched Mar-Veil's core.

1004
01:14:35,764 --> 01:14:37,599
Now we know why.

1005
01:14:39,434 --> 01:14:43,396
If only you knew the importance of it to me.

1006
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:46,232
I just need your help

1007
01:14:46,316 --> 01:14:49,861
decoding the coordinates to Mar-Veil's lab.

1008
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:53,615
Those weren't coordinates. They're state vectors.

1009
01:14:53,782 --> 01:14:55,700
For orbital position and velocity.

1010
01:14:55,867 --> 01:14:57,577
You didn't find her lab on Earth,

1011
01:14:57,661 --> 01:14:58,912
'cause it's not on Earth.

1012
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:00,163
That was the location

1013
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:01,331
on the date of the crash six years ago.

1014
01:15:01,498 --> 01:15:02,874
If we track its course,

1015
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:05,251
we'll find it in orbit right now.

1016
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:07,128
It's just basic physics.

1017
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:10,590
In orbit?

1018
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:14,094
Was that so difficult to figure out?

1019
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,471
I mean, you're my science guy, right?

1020
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:19,683
Yon-Rogg will catch up to me soon.

1021
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:22,435
We've got to get to the core before he does.

1022
01:15:22,644 --> 01:15:24,312
Mmm. We're going to space?

1023
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:25,480
In what?

1024
01:15:25,647 --> 01:15:27,273
A few tweaks to your vessel should do it.

1025
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,567
I can handle the modifications.

1026
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:31,403
Mmm. Your science guy.

1027
01:15:38,326 --> 01:15:39,869
Well, I could use a copilot.

1028
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:43,623
No. No, I can't.

1029
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:45,667
I can't leave Monica.

1030
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:48,628
Mom, it's okay. I can stay with Gramma and Paw-paw.

1031
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:51,256
There's no way I'm going, baby. It's too dangerous.

1032
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,341
Testing brand-new aerospace tech is dangerous...

1033
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:54,551
and you used to do that.

1034
01:15:56,344 --> 01:15:58,221
Your plan is to leave the atmosphere

1035
01:15:58,304 --> 01:15:59,723
in a craft not designed for the journey...

1036
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:01,474
and you anticipate hostile encounters...

1037
01:16:01,683 --> 01:16:02,726
with a technologically-superior

1038
01:16:02,809 --> 01:16:03,810
foreign enemy.

1039
01:16:04,352 --> 01:16:05,645
Correct?

1040
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:06,813
That's what I'm saying.

1041
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,148
- You have to go! - Monica!

1042
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:09,399
You have a chance to fly the coolest mission

1043
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:10,608
in the history of missions...

1044
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:12,527
and you're gonna give it up to sit on the couch

1045
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:13,862
and watch Fresh Prince with me?

1046
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:15,613
What?

1047
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:16,823
I just think you should consider...

1048
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:20,285
what kind of example you're setting for your daughter.

1049
01:16:27,876 --> 01:16:29,210
What's going on around here?

1050
01:16:29,377 --> 01:16:30,378
I know, I know.

1051
01:16:30,462 --> 01:16:31,963
I'll explain inside. Thank you.

1052
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:39,220
Your mom's lucky.

1053
01:16:39,387 --> 01:16:40,680
When they were handing out kids,

1054
01:16:40,764 --> 01:16:42,432
they gave her the toughest one.

1055
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:44,017
Lieutenant Trouble.

1056
01:16:45,018 --> 01:16:46,561
You remembered.

1057
01:16:48,021 --> 01:16:49,355
Is that mine?

1058
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:51,691
No, no.

1059
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,611
You hang on to it until I come back.

1060
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:57,655
But there is something that I need your help with.

1061
01:16:57,864 --> 01:17:00,492
I can't wear these Kree colors anymore.

1062
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,703
And since you are obviously the only person around here

1063
01:17:03,787 --> 01:17:05,622
with any sense of style...

1064
01:17:06,915 --> 01:17:07,999
Hmm?

1065
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:11,169
Whoa.

1066
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:14,923
No.

1067
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:18,259
Uh-uh.

1068
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:21,304
Definitely not.

1069
01:17:24,349 --> 01:17:26,643
Well, since we're on the same team...

1070
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:38,905
Hmm.

1071
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:41,866
How do I look?

1072
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:46,704
Fresh.

1073
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:07,851
What took you so long?

1074
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:10,937
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

1075
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:13,982
- PRY46-B... - No, no codes.

1076
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,900
That system is fallible, as we've learned.

1077
01:18:16,943 --> 01:18:18,653
Okay, then let's do this.

1078
01:18:19,362 --> 01:18:22,532
Who do I see when I commune with the Supreme Intelligence?

1079
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:25,410
The person you most admire and respect, I'd guess.

1080
01:18:25,577 --> 01:18:26,786
But you would never tell me who.

1081
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:31,416
And what is your earliest memory of Hala?

1082
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:33,084
The transfusion.

1083
01:18:33,251 --> 01:18:35,336
Blue blood running through my veins.

1084
01:18:35,503 --> 01:18:36,504
Whose blood?

1085
01:18:39,257 --> 01:18:40,300
Hmm.

1086
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,686
That's my blood that's coursing through her veins.

1087
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:57,692
What have you done with her?

1088
01:18:57,859 --> 01:18:59,819
You're too late.

1089
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:17,462
She knows?

1090
01:19:32,143 --> 01:19:35,438
Ronan, Skrulls have infiltrated C-53.

1091
01:19:35,605 --> 01:19:36,606
Come at once.

1092
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:38,858
For the good of all Kree, Commander...

1093
01:19:39,067 --> 01:19:41,861
the infestation will be eradicated.

1094
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:45,865
Passing 500 and climbing.

1095
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:52,246
You know, you really shouldn't have that thing on your lap.

1096
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:55,583
Our little alliance with you is tenuous at best.

1097
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:58,461
And as long as he continues to freak you out...

1098
01:19:58,628 --> 01:19:59,796
like that...

1099
01:19:59,963 --> 01:20:02,382
yeah, I'm gonna keep giving him

1100
01:20:02,465 --> 01:20:05,301
all the loves and hugs that he needs, right?

1101
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:07,053
Can I ask you something?

1102
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,305
Do you just turn into anything you want?

1103
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:11,140
Ah, well, I have to see it first.

1104
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:12,392
Can you all do it?

1105
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,602
Physiologically? Yeah.

1106
01:20:14,769 --> 01:20:16,938
But, uh, it takes practice...

1107
01:20:17,105 --> 01:20:20,817
and, um, dare I say it, talent to do it well.

1108
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:23,486
- Can you turn into a cat? - What's a cat?

1109
01:20:23,653 --> 01:20:24,737
What about a filing cabinet?

1110
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:28,241
Why would I turn into a filing cabinet?

1111
01:20:28,408 --> 01:20:29,492
A Venus flytrap?

1112
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:30,660
I'll give you 50 bucks right now

1113
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:31,953
if you turn into a Venus flytrap.

1114
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:33,705
Switching engines

1115
01:20:33,788 --> 01:20:36,082
from Scram jet to Fusion. Buckle up, folks.

1116
01:20:45,258 --> 01:20:46,259
Hey.

1117
01:20:46,426 --> 01:20:48,928
Is this normal, like, space turbulence?

1118
01:20:49,012 --> 01:20:50,013
Pretty much.

1119
01:21:23,755 --> 01:21:25,757
Locking in on coordinate grid.

1120
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:27,550
Where is it?

1121
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:33,806
It's here. It's gotta be here.

1122
01:21:33,973 --> 01:21:39,228
Well, is it in front of all that nothing, or behind it?

1123
01:21:44,776 --> 01:21:46,778
Decloaking activated.

1124
01:22:49,841 --> 01:22:51,551
Is that it? The core?

1125
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:54,011
In her notes she called it the Tesseract.

1126
01:23:00,143 --> 01:23:01,227
Whoa.

1127
01:23:02,812 --> 01:23:05,022
What was Lawson doing with all this kid stuff?

1128
01:23:18,953 --> 01:23:19,996
We're not alone.

1129
01:23:43,144 --> 01:23:44,478
Talos!

1130
01:23:54,405 --> 01:23:57,283
He didn't come here for the Tesseract.

1131
01:24:19,847 --> 01:24:21,057
It's okay.

1132
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,647
We didn't know what to do.

1133
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:31,108
Mar-Vell warned us not to send a signal for any reason...

1134
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:32,568
or the Kree would find us.

1135
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:35,112
You did the right thing.

1136
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:45,957
It's okay, it's okay.

1137
01:24:46,499 --> 01:24:48,584
She's all right. She's a friend.

1138
01:24:50,628 --> 01:24:52,255
I am not gonna hurt you.

1139
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:54,423
She led me to you.

1140
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:56,676
I'm so sorry.

1141
01:24:58,386 --> 01:24:59,637
I didn't know.

1142
01:24:59,804 --> 01:25:00,846
Carol.

1143
01:25:01,681 --> 01:25:03,641
This is war.

1144
01:25:04,475 --> 01:25:07,853
My hands are filthy from it, too.

1145
01:25:08,646 --> 01:25:10,398
But we're here now.

1146
01:25:10,815 --> 01:25:13,859
You found my family.

1147
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:18,072
This is just the beginning.

1148
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:21,742
There are thousands of us separated from each other...

1149
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:25,579
scattered throughout the galaxy.

1150
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:45,558
If I played the same pinball machine for six years...

1151
01:25:45,725 --> 01:25:47,643
I'd have some high scores, too.

1152
01:25:50,271 --> 01:25:52,565
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1153
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:53,774
Uh-uh.

1154
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:07,830
What did you do to your uniform?

1155
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:09,999
They got in her head. Just like we thought.

1156
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:11,834
The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight.

1157
01:26:12,001 --> 01:26:13,377
You can see they're not soldiers.

1158
01:26:13,586 --> 01:26:15,880
Let 'em go. You can have me.

1159
01:26:16,047 --> 01:26:17,214
And the core?

1160
01:26:17,715 --> 01:26:19,050
You lied to me.

1161
01:26:19,216 --> 01:26:23,137
I made you the best version of yourself.

1162
01:26:26,599 --> 01:26:29,518
What's given can be taken away.

1163
01:26:43,366 --> 01:26:44,367
Back here! Move, move!

1164
01:26:44,492 --> 01:26:46,952
Get over here. Get down!

1165
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:50,164
Let's go! Go, move!

1166
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:30,579
There she is.

1167
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:34,792
Seems like your time on C-53 jogged the old memory.

1168
01:27:35,668 --> 01:27:36,877
This jacket.

1169
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:39,505
It's killer, by the way.

1170
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:42,383
Oh.

1171
01:27:42,508 --> 01:27:44,510
The music. It's a nice touch.

1172
01:27:44,802 --> 01:27:46,429
Let me out.

1173
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:47,972
No can do.

1174
01:27:48,514 --> 01:27:52,226
If you hurt them, I will burn you to the ground.

1175
01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:54,145
With what exactly?

1176
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:55,646
Your power comes from us.

1177
01:27:55,813 --> 01:27:57,565
You didn't give me these powers.

1178
01:27:57,731 --> 01:27:58,774
The blast did.

1179
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:00,192
And yet, you've never had the strength

1180
01:28:00,276 --> 01:28:01,402
to control them on your own.

1181
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,457
Species: Flerken.

1182
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,125
Threat: high.

1183
01:28:21,464 --> 01:28:23,340
It's a cat, not Hannibal Lecter.

1184
01:28:27,011 --> 01:28:28,471
Species: human male.

1185
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:30,890
Threat: low to none.

1186
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:33,350
That thing's clearly busted.

1187
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:35,644
Load the Flerken onto the Helion.

1188
01:28:36,437 --> 01:28:38,397
Eject the others into space.

1189
01:28:41,275 --> 01:28:43,319
You did good, Ace.

1190
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:45,946
Thanks to you...

1191
01:28:46,113 --> 01:28:48,073
those insidious shapeshifters

1192
01:28:48,157 --> 01:28:49,700
will threaten our borders no more.

1193
01:28:49,867 --> 01:28:52,119
I used to believe your lies...

1194
01:28:52,286 --> 01:28:54,914
but the Skrulls are just fighting for a home.

1195
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,624
You're talking about destroying them

1196
01:28:56,707 --> 01:28:58,334
because they won't submit to your rule.

1197
01:28:58,501 --> 01:28:59,585
And neither will I.

1198
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:02,922
We found you. We embraced you as our own.

1199
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:04,548
You stole me.

1200
01:29:04,715 --> 01:29:07,426
From my home, my family, my friends.

1201
01:29:15,518 --> 01:29:17,394
It's cute how hard you try.

1202
01:29:19,522 --> 01:29:21,190
But remember...

1203
01:29:22,525 --> 01:29:23,734
without us...

1204
01:29:23,901 --> 01:29:24,985
Give it up, Carol.

1205
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:27,905
Stay down!

1206
01:29:28,072 --> 01:29:29,156
...you're weak.

1207
01:29:29,657 --> 01:29:31,408
You're going too fast! You need to go slow!

1208
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:32,910
You're flawed.

1209
01:29:33,077 --> 01:29:34,286
Are you trying to kill yourself?

1210
01:29:35,246 --> 01:29:36,247
Helpless.

1211
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:37,414
You're too emotional and so weak.

1212
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:39,250
You don't belong out here!

1213
01:29:39,917 --> 01:29:41,335
We saved you.

1214
01:29:41,544 --> 01:29:43,045
- Control it. - I told you,

1215
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:44,129
- Carol. - They'll never

1216
01:29:44,213 --> 01:29:45,214
- let you fly. - This ain't

1217
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:46,382
- a game for little girls. - You kiss like a horse.

1218
01:29:46,465 --> 01:29:47,466
You won't last a week, Danvers.

1219
01:29:50,678 --> 01:29:53,764
Without us, you're only human.

1220
01:29:55,224 --> 01:29:56,475
You're right.

1221
01:29:57,726 --> 01:29:59,853
I'm only human.

1222
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:37,141
On Hala, you were reborn...

1223
01:30:37,308 --> 01:30:38,684
Vers.

1224
01:30:43,689 --> 01:30:46,609
My name is Carol.

1225
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:02,958
She's trying to break out.

1226
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:50,589
I've been fighting with one arm tied behind my back.

1227
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:53,133
But what happens when...

1228
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:58,305
I'm finally set free?

1229
01:32:38,804 --> 01:32:41,348
You know you're glowing, right?

1230
01:32:41,515 --> 01:32:42,516
I'll explain it later.

1231
01:32:45,227 --> 01:32:46,395
Take the Tesseract.

1232
01:32:46,562 --> 01:32:47,688
Leave the lunchbox.

1233
01:32:47,855 --> 01:32:49,356
- Me? - Yes.

1234
01:32:49,523 --> 01:32:50,858
I'm not touching that thing.

1235
01:32:51,024 --> 01:32:52,109
You want me to get you an oven mitt?

1236
01:32:57,948 --> 01:32:59,158
Whoa!

1237
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:08,292
Get the Skrulls on the Quad jet and go.

1238
01:33:08,459 --> 01:33:10,586
Take the Flerken with you.

1239
01:33:11,295 --> 01:33:13,005
- What about you? - I'll buy you some time!

1240
01:33:14,923 --> 01:33:16,759
I'm picking you up now.

1241
01:33:19,887 --> 01:33:22,181
I'm trusting you not to eat me.

1242
01:33:27,603 --> 01:33:28,604
Oh, hey, guys.

1243
01:33:32,483 --> 01:33:34,151
Arm wrestle for the Tesseract?

1244
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:39,156
I used to find you amusing.

1245
01:33:39,865 --> 01:33:40,866
Let's put an end to this.

1246
01:34:16,318 --> 01:34:17,277
Okay.

1247
01:34:17,736 --> 01:34:18,946
Good kitty.

1248
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:07,202
You knew all along.

1249
01:35:08,328 --> 01:35:09,454
Is that why we never hung out?

1250
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:10,747
No, I just never liked you.

1251
01:35:18,005 --> 01:35:19,006
Incoming!

1252
01:35:27,514 --> 01:35:28,515
Hey, in a hurry?

1253
01:35:30,767 --> 01:35:32,519
Don't make me do this.

1254
01:35:32,769 --> 01:35:33,770
Okay.

1255
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:50,621
Come on, do your thing!

1256
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:52,915
Come on!

1257
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:56,668
Come on!

1258
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:01,173
Damn it, Goose.

1259
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:02,382
Pick a side.

1260
01:36:06,595 --> 01:36:08,472
Take them to the hangar, too.

1261
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:10,432
We'll blast them all into space.

1262
01:36:12,517 --> 01:36:13,518
Play it cool.

1263
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:16,355
Just like Havana.

1264
01:36:18,148 --> 01:36:20,275
Do you have the thing?

1265
01:36:20,442 --> 01:36:21,985
Flerken kitty ate it.

1266
01:36:35,374 --> 01:36:36,750
Come on, move!

1267
01:36:36,917 --> 01:36:38,085
Move!

1268
01:36:38,669 --> 01:36:39,962
Follow my lead.

1269
01:36:43,966 --> 01:36:44,967
Cover her eyes.

1270
01:36:53,475 --> 01:36:54,977
Onto the ship!

1271
01:36:55,185 --> 01:36:56,895
Let's go! Let's go!

1272
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:21,753
Nice diversion.

1273
01:37:22,129 --> 01:37:23,880
I could have swore I put it in there.

1274
01:38:20,896 --> 01:38:22,981
Minn-Erva, take them down in the drop ship.

1275
01:38:23,148 --> 01:38:24,232
On it.

1276
01:38:28,904 --> 01:38:30,030
You all right, friend?

1277
01:38:31,114 --> 01:38:33,033
Never better.

1278
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:39,623
We got a bogey coming in hot.

1279
01:40:19,514 --> 01:40:21,141
Yes! Boom!

1280
01:40:37,157 --> 01:40:38,366
Whoo!

1281
01:40:41,703 --> 01:40:43,038
What the hell was that?

1282
01:41:06,436 --> 01:41:08,563
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1283
01:42:00,824 --> 01:42:02,242
That's impossible.

1284
01:42:02,409 --> 01:42:04,786
C-53 doesn't have a defense system

1285
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:07,497
advanced enough to destroy our warheads.

1286
01:42:08,957 --> 01:42:11,459
That's not their defense system, Ronan.

1287
01:42:15,922 --> 01:42:17,090
Take her down.

1288
01:42:37,027 --> 01:42:38,069
Whoo!

1289
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:29,579
Return to the jump point.

1290
01:43:30,622 --> 01:43:32,749
We'll be back for the weapon.

1291
01:43:34,292 --> 01:43:35,502
The core?

1292
01:43:37,337 --> 01:43:38,630
The woman.

1293
01:44:26,761 --> 01:44:28,221
I'm so proud of you.

1294
01:44:30,223 --> 01:44:31,599
You've come a long way

1295
01:44:31,683 --> 01:44:33,643
since I found you that day by the lake.

1296
01:44:34,185 --> 01:44:36,312
But can you keep your emotions in check

1297
01:44:36,396 --> 01:44:38,606
long enough to take me on?

1298
01:44:38,773 --> 01:44:41,443
Or will they get the better of you as always?

1299
01:44:42,986 --> 01:44:44,654
I always told you...

1300
01:44:44,821 --> 01:44:46,114
you'll be ready

1301
01:44:46,197 --> 01:44:48,533
the day you can knock me down as yourself.

1302
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:50,160
This is that moment.

1303
01:44:50,326 --> 01:44:52,829
This is that moment, Vers!

1304
01:44:52,996 --> 01:44:54,080
Turn off the light show...

1305
01:44:54,247 --> 01:44:57,584
and prove to me you can beat me without...

1306
01:45:13,099 --> 01:45:15,101
I have nothing to prove to you.

1307
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:32,994
Destination: Hala.

1308
01:45:33,161 --> 01:45:34,787
I can't go back empty-handed.

1309
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:36,706
You won't be empty-handed.

1310
01:45:36,873 --> 01:45:39,167
I'm sending you with a message.

1311
01:45:39,334 --> 01:45:42,504
Tell the Supreme Intelligence that I'm coming to end it.

1312
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:45,423
The war. The lies. All of it.

1313
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:48,676
You can't do this.

1314
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:11,157
That was a close call, huh, Goosey? Huh?

1315
01:46:12,325 --> 01:46:13,701
Those bad guys still in there somewhere?

1316
01:46:13,785 --> 01:46:14,869
Ow!

1317
01:46:14,953 --> 01:46:16,204
Mother Flerken!

1318
01:46:16,371 --> 01:46:17,455
- You okay? - Yeah.

1319
01:46:17,914 --> 01:46:19,457
It's just a scratch.

1320
01:46:19,832 --> 01:46:21,125
No.

1321
01:46:28,675 --> 01:46:30,510
I can't believe

1322
01:46:30,593 --> 01:46:31,970
you got in the raddest dogfight ever...

1323
01:46:32,095 --> 01:46:33,471
and I missed it.

1324
01:46:33,638 --> 01:46:35,223
I'd say you arrived just in time.

1325
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:37,433
Some nifty flying you did out there.

1326
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,602
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use a good pilot like you.

1327
01:46:39,769 --> 01:46:41,479
I'll consider it...

1328
01:46:41,646 --> 01:46:44,649
as long as you never call my flying "nifty" again.

1329
01:46:44,816 --> 01:46:45,984
How's your eye?

1330
01:46:46,067 --> 01:46:48,194
Hmm. Getting better every second.

1331
01:46:48,361 --> 01:46:49,571
Just so I'm clear...

1332
01:46:49,737 --> 01:46:51,114
you were Soh-Larr...

1333
01:46:51,281 --> 01:46:53,324
- and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent? - Keller.

1334
01:46:53,825 --> 01:46:56,160
He tied my boss up, stole his identity.

1335
01:46:56,327 --> 01:46:59,163
I borrowed his likeness. I'm no thief.

1336
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:00,582
It is a little like stealing.

1337
01:47:00,748 --> 01:47:02,041
Whose side are you on here?

1338
01:47:02,417 --> 01:47:03,876
You're good to go here until you recover...

1339
01:47:04,043 --> 01:47:07,088
but you and your family are gonna need a new look.

1340
01:47:07,255 --> 01:47:08,840
I could go back to being your boss.

1341
01:47:09,007 --> 01:47:10,008
Uh, please don't.

1342
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:13,011
Come on. I loved sporting his beautiful blue eyes.

1343
01:47:13,177 --> 01:47:15,513
No way. You guys have the best eyes.

1344
01:47:15,722 --> 01:47:17,682
Don't ever change your eyes.

1345
01:47:17,765 --> 01:47:19,225
She has beautiful eyes. That's very sweet of you.

1346
01:47:19,309 --> 01:47:20,977
I was trying not to panic...

1347
01:47:21,144 --> 01:47:22,604
I'll help you find a home.

1348
01:47:23,688 --> 01:47:24,814
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1349
01:47:26,899 --> 01:47:29,068
They can stay here with us.

1350
01:47:29,277 --> 01:47:30,820
Can't they, Mom?

1351
01:47:30,987 --> 01:47:32,905
They won't be safe here, baby.

1352
01:47:33,531 --> 01:47:35,074
Auntie Carol's right.

1353
01:47:35,241 --> 01:47:36,242
They need their own home.

1354
01:47:37,452 --> 01:47:39,245
I'll be back before you know it.

1355
01:47:39,704 --> 01:47:42,999
Or maybe I could fly up and meet you halfway?

1356
01:47:43,166 --> 01:47:45,960
Ah, only if you learn to glow like your Auntie Carol.

1357
01:47:46,127 --> 01:47:47,503
Or maybe I'll build a spaceship.

1358
01:47:47,587 --> 01:47:49,339
- You don't know. - He doesn't.

1359
01:47:59,098 --> 01:48:01,517
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.

1360
01:48:02,226 --> 01:48:03,227
Hidden.

1361
01:48:03,394 --> 01:48:05,438
You sure that's what Marvel would want?

1362
01:48:06,105 --> 01:48:07,190
Mar-Vell.

1363
01:48:07,357 --> 01:48:08,650
That's what I said.

1364
01:48:08,816 --> 01:48:11,152
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

1365
01:48:11,319 --> 01:48:12,654
Mar-Vell.

1366
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:13,905
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.

1367
01:48:13,988 --> 01:48:15,281
You know, like the Marvelettes.

1368
01:48:29,212 --> 01:48:30,254
Not ringing any bells?

1369
01:48:30,421 --> 01:48:32,215
Keep singing. Maybe it'll come back to me.

1370
01:48:47,563 --> 01:48:49,065
I upgraded it.

1371
01:48:49,691 --> 01:48:52,151
Range should be a couple galaxies, at least.

1372
01:48:54,779 --> 01:48:56,989
What? You think I'm gonna crank call you?

1373
01:48:57,156 --> 01:49:00,702
For emergencies only, okay?

1374
01:49:05,331 --> 01:49:07,458
Well...

1375
01:49:08,167 --> 01:49:10,420
if you're ever passing back through this galaxy...

1376
01:49:10,586 --> 01:49:12,630
be sure to give a brother a shout.

1377
01:49:14,841 --> 01:49:16,676
Oh!

1378
01:49:29,397 --> 01:49:31,441
We got the ketchup stain off.

1379
01:49:36,863 --> 01:49:38,656
Thanks, Lieutenant Trouble.

1380
01:49:40,658 --> 01:49:41,868
Hmm.

1381
01:49:47,957 --> 01:49:50,543
It's hard for me to say goodbye, too.

1382
01:50:04,223 --> 01:50:05,391
Go on.

1383
01:51:12,458 --> 01:51:15,211
Glad to have you back, sir. This came for you.

1384
01:51:20,132 --> 01:51:21,342
So, is it true?

1385
01:51:22,426 --> 01:51:23,636
That the Kree burned your eye out...

1386
01:51:23,845 --> 01:51:26,222
because you refused to give them the Tesseract?

1387
01:51:27,181 --> 01:51:30,852
I will neither confirm nor deny the facts of that story.

1388
01:51:31,102 --> 01:51:32,186
Understood.

1389
01:51:33,729 --> 01:51:34,730
I'm sorry to report

1390
01:51:34,814 --> 01:51:35,815
that we still haven't found the Tesseract.

1391
01:51:35,982 --> 01:51:38,192
I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.

1392
01:51:39,819 --> 01:51:41,529
I'll let you know when it does.

1393
01:51:41,696 --> 01:51:43,072
Then what?

1394
01:51:43,614 --> 01:51:44,615
Sir?

1395
01:51:44,991 --> 01:51:46,117
We have no idea

1396
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:49,245
what other intergalactic threats are out there.

1397
01:51:49,412 --> 01:51:51,414
And our one-woman security force

1398
01:51:51,497 --> 01:51:52,748
had a prior commitment...

1399
01:51:52,915 --> 01:51:54,667
on the other side of the universe.

1400
01:51:57,503 --> 01:51:59,547
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone can't protect us.

1401
01:52:01,299 --> 01:52:02,842
We need to find more.

1402
01:52:03,134 --> 01:52:04,135
More weapons?

1403
01:52:04,302 --> 01:52:05,928
More heroes.

1404
01:52:06,178 --> 01:52:07,722
You think you can find others like her?

1405
01:52:07,805 --> 01:52:10,808
Hmm, we found her, and we weren't even looking.

1406
01:52:11,893 --> 01:52:13,185
Get some rest, sir.

1407
01:52:14,270 --> 01:52:16,105
You got a big decision to make.

1408
01:55:15,242 --> 01:55:16,911
This is a nightmare.

1409
01:55:18,621 --> 01:55:20,831
I've had better nightmares.

1410
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,043
Hey.

1411
01:55:25,127 --> 01:55:27,213
So, that thing just stopped

1412
01:55:27,296 --> 01:55:29,006
doing whatever the hell it was doing.

1413
01:55:30,925 --> 01:55:32,718
What do we got?

1414
01:55:33,636 --> 01:55:35,930
Whatever signal it was sending finally crapped out.

1415
01:55:36,138 --> 01:55:37,181
I thought we bypassed the battery.

1416
01:55:37,264 --> 01:55:38,265
We did.

1417
01:55:38,432 --> 01:55:41,268
It's still plugged in. It just stopped.

1418
01:55:42,186 --> 01:55:43,938
Reboot it. Send the signal again.

1419
01:55:44,105 --> 01:55:45,523
We don't even know what this is.

1420
01:55:45,689 --> 01:55:48,067
Fury did. Just do it, please.

1421
01:55:48,359 --> 01:55:50,861
You tell me the second you get a signal.

1422
01:55:51,028 --> 01:55:53,531
I wanna know who's on the other end of that thing.

1423
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:57,868
Where's Fury?
