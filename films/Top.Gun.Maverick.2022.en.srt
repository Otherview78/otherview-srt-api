00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:09,633
Today, we're looking at some of the hottest weather...

12
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:06,077
Hey.

13
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:11,783
What is it?

14
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:15,086
What?

15
00:05:15,187 --> 00:05:16,989
We've been ordered to stand down.

16
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:18,790
They're scrapping the program.

17
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:21,693
They say we fell short.

18
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:23,929
The contract threshold is mach 10.

19
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:26,365
Mach 10 is supposed to be in two months.

20
00:05:26,497 --> 00:05:28,300
Today's test point is mach 9.

21
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:30,235
Well, that's not good enough.

22
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:31,602
Says who?

23
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:33,604
Admiral Cain.

24
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:35,907
The drone ranger.

25
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,377
He wants our budget for his unmanned program.

26
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:42,545
He's on his way to kill the test and shut us down personally.

27
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:57,796
Well, he isn't here yet.

28
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:03,168
They want mach 10,

29
00:06:03,802 --> 00:06:05,203
let's give 'em mach 10.

30
00:06:22,988 --> 00:06:25,858
Now remember, the contract threshold is mach 10.

31
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:29,529
Not 10.1. Not 10.2. Mach 10.

32
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,898
That should keep the program alive.

33
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,269
I don't like that look, mav.

34
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:39,906
It's the only one I got.

35
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:51,050
Control, this is dark star. How do you read?

36
00:06:51,184 --> 00:06:53,419
Dark star, control. Loud and clear. How me?

37
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:56,889
Loud and clear. Takeoff precheck's complete. Ready for apu start.

38
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,992
Ready left engine start.

39
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:03,163
Ready right engine start.

40
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:05,332
Thumbs for taxi.

41
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:09,470
We are ready for taxi.

42
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:14,174
Tower, this is dark star. We are taxiing with information Alpha.

43
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,428
Dark star, you are clear to taxi.

44
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,179
Runway 21. Winds 210, 10.

45
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,647
- Fuel temps are looking good. - Control concurs.

46
00:07:21,782 --> 00:07:24,451
Battery's holding at 95%. Cabin pressure looks good.

47
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:27,545
Control concurs. Tower, this is dark star. We're ready for takeoff.

48
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:30,491
Requesting an unrestricted climb to 600 and above.

49
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:33,103
Dark star, the runway and skies are yours.

50
00:07:33,227 --> 00:07:35,661
Rear admiral Chester Cain.

51
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:38,800
Maverick, Cain just pulled up to the gate.

52
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,102
It's not too late to stop, buddy.

53
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:45,206
You know what happens to you if you go through with this.

54
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:49,377
I know what happens to everyone else if I don't.

55
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:53,780
Dark star is ready for takeoff.

56
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,751
Everyone,

57
00:07:57,885 --> 00:08:00,387
go for takeoff, starting with engine.

58
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,289
- Engine, go. - Thermals, go.

59
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:04,358
- Fuel, go. - Electric, go.

60
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:06,059
Control surfaces, go.

61
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:08,595
Dark star, control. You're cleared for takeoff.

62
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:10,397
All right, sweetheart,

63
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:12,166
one last ride.

64
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:41,763
Dark star, you are cleared above 600. Increase to mach 3.5.

65
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:46,000
Cleared above 600. Increase to mach 3.5.

66
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,309
Admiral.

67
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:56,478
- Uh, just in time, sir. - I'm early. So are you.

68
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:57,913
You care to explain?

69
00:08:58,047 --> 00:09:00,249
Transitioning to scramjet.

70
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:15,798
Uh, mav, admiral Cain is asking...

71
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,234
- Ordering. - Ordering that we bring her down.

72
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,727
Op... oop... Alpha...

73
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:22,037
three, oh...

74
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:25,441
as sing... ach... Ive... 4, and...

75
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:27,276
within six...

76
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:29,290
This is where we've had trouble with comms, sir.

77
00:09:29,346 --> 00:09:31,716
It's the earth's curvature. It's called "earth bulge."

78
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:33,350
Did anyone offer you a coffee?

79
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:36,118
Okay.

80
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,595
He's at mach 7, pushing 8.

81
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,131
- Flight data? - Receiving. Data is good.

82
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:56,573
Temperature's climbing. Response is still stable. We're feeling good.

83
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:01,878
Mach 8.8.

84
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:03,880
8.9.

85
00:10:04,347 --> 00:10:05,516
Mach 9.

86
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,451
He's the fastest man alive.

87
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:28,371
Talk to me, goose.

88
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,474
Mach 9.1.

89
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:33,476
9.2.

90
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:42,085
Mach 9.3.

91
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:46,023
9.4.

92
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:49,393
Approaching high hypersonic.

93
00:11:01,672 --> 00:11:03,341
Windshield hot caution.

94
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:14,151
Surface temp rising.

95
00:11:19,223 --> 00:11:21,426
Come on, sweetheart, just a little more.

96
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,096
Just a little.

97
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:28,033
Come on!

98
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:35,539
Come on!

99
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:43,382
Mach 10!

100
00:11:44,349 --> 00:11:46,451
Put that in your Pentagon budget!

101
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:49,554
Sir.

102
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,301
Oh, don't do it. Don't do it.

103
00:12:02,435 --> 00:12:03,469
Just...

104
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:07,540
A little push.

105
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,346
Holy shit.

106
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:25,758
You got some balls, stick jockey.

107
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:27,159
I'll give you that.

108
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,998
Oh, shit.

109
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:39,238
Maverick.

110
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,508
Maverick!

111
00:13:32,694 --> 00:13:33,994
Thank you.

112
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:36,330
Where am I?

113
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,532
Earth.

114
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:54,182
Maverick.

115
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:57,018
Thirty-plus years of service.

116
00:13:57,953 --> 00:13:59,387
Combat medals.

117
00:13:59,521 --> 00:14:00,990
Citations.

118
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:06,060
Only man to shoot down three enemy planes in the last 40 years.

119
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:07,830
"Distinguished."

120
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:11,566
"Distinguished." "distinguished."

121
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:16,404
Yet you can't get a promotion, you won't retire,

122
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:19,507
and despite your best efforts, you refuse to die.

123
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:24,781
You should be at least a two-star admiral by now, if not a senator.

124
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:26,649
Yet here you are:

125
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,451
Captain.

126
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,654
Why is that?

127
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:33,823
It's one of life's mysteries, sir.

128
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:37,459
This isn't a joke. I asked you a question.

129
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:41,462
I'm where I belong, sir.

130
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:44,700
Well, the Navy doesn't see it that way.

131
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:46,802
Not anymore.

132
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:50,171
These planes you've been testing,

133
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:52,041
captain,

134
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:55,610
one day, sooner than later, they won't need pilots at all.

135
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:59,514
Pilots that need to sleep, eat, take a piss.

136
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,820
Pilots that disobey orders.

137
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:08,324
All you did was buy some time for those men out there.

138
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,594
The future is coming,

139
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:14,496
and you're not in it.

140
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:18,500
Escort this man off the base.

141
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:21,170
Take him to his quarters.

142
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:24,106
Wait with him while he packs his gear.

143
00:15:25,942 --> 00:15:29,478
I want him on the road to north island within the hour.

144
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:34,316
North island, sir?

145
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:37,152
Call came in with impeccable timing,

146
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:42,093
right as I was driving here to ground your ass once and for all.

147
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:45,462
It galls me to say it, but...

148
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:50,600
For reasons known only to the almighty and your guardian angel...

149
00:15:52,402 --> 00:15:55,138
You've been called back to top gun.

150
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:02,612
- Sir? - You are dismissed, captain.

151
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:10,253
The end is inevitable, Maverick.

152
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,622
Your kind is headed for extinction.

153
00:16:16,227 --> 00:16:17,863
Maybe so, sir.

154
00:16:19,363 --> 00:16:21,165
But not today.

155
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:29,267
Captain Pete "Maverick" Mitchell.

156
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:31,536
Your reputation precedes you.

157
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:33,806
Thank you, sir.

158
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,641
Wasn't a compliment.

159
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:40,312
I'm admiral Beau Simpson. I'm the air boss.

160
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:42,915
I believe you know admiral bates. Warlock, sir.

161
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:45,785
Must admit, I wasn't expecting an invitation back.

162
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:47,987
They're called orders, Maverick.

163
00:17:49,254 --> 00:17:50,589
You two have something in common.

164
00:17:50,723 --> 00:17:53,492
Cyclone here was first in his class back in '88.

165
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,762
Actually, sir, I finished second.

166
00:17:55,895 --> 00:17:58,563
Just want to manage expectations.

167
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:03,936
The target...

168
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:08,508
Is an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant

169
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:10,944
built in violation of a multilateral NATO treaty.

170
00:18:11,078 --> 00:18:14,181
The uranium produced there represents a direct threat

171
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:15,481
to our allies in the region.

172
00:18:15,615 --> 00:18:17,084
The Pentagon has tasked us

173
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:19,753
with assembling a strike team and taking it out

174
00:18:19,887 --> 00:18:22,355
before it becomes fully operational.

175
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:26,492
The plant sits in an underground bunker at the end of this valley.

176
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:28,128
Said valley is GPS-jammed

177
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:30,998
and defended by an extensive surface-to-air missile array

178
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:33,834
serving a limited number of fifth-generation fighters,

179
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:38,071
which in turn are backed up by a plentiful reserve of surplus aircraft.

180
00:18:38,205 --> 00:18:40,207
Even a few old f-14s.

181
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:42,977
Seems like we're not the only ones holding on to old relics.

182
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:46,881
What's your read, captain?

183
00:18:48,183 --> 00:18:52,086
Well, sir, normally this would be a cakewalk for the f-35's stealth,

184
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,521
but the GPS-jamming negates that.

185
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:58,592
And a surface-to-air threat necessitates a low-level laser-guided strike

186
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:00,195
tailor-made for the f-18.

187
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:01,763
I figure,

188
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:03,798
two precision bombs, minimum.

189
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:06,835
Makes it four aircraft flying in pairs.

190
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:09,037
That is one hell of a steep climb out of there,

191
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,839
exposing you to all the surface-to-air missiles.

192
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:13,841
You survive that,

193
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:16,243
it's a dogfight all the way home.

194
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,680
All requirements for which you have real-world experience.

195
00:19:19,814 --> 00:19:22,382
Not in the same mission, sir.

196
00:19:24,953 --> 00:19:25,987
No.

197
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:31,125
No, someone's not coming back from this.

198
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:32,559
Can it be done or not?

199
00:19:32,694 --> 00:19:35,163
How soon before the plant becomes operational?

200
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:37,165
Three weeks. Maybe less.

201
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,102
Well, it's been a while since I've flown an f-18, and...

202
00:19:42,136 --> 00:19:44,438
I'm not sure who I'd trust to fly the other three.

203
00:19:44,571 --> 00:19:46,640
But I'll find a way to make it work.

204
00:19:46,774 --> 00:19:48,710
I think you misunderstand, captain.

205
00:19:49,143 --> 00:19:50,143
Sir?

206
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:52,080
We don't want you to fly it.

207
00:19:52,213 --> 00:19:53,614
We want you to teach it.

208
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:57,753
Teach, sir?

209
00:19:58,988 --> 00:20:02,523
We've recalled 12 top gun graduates from their squadrons.

210
00:20:02,657 --> 00:20:05,060
We want you to narrow that pool down to six.

211
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:07,863
They'll fly the mission.

212
00:20:09,397 --> 00:20:10,966
Is there a problem, captain?

213
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:15,137
You know there is, sir.

214
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:17,373
Yeah.

215
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:19,942
Bradley bradshaw, aka "rooster."

216
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:22,144
I understand you used to fly with his old man.

217
00:20:22,278 --> 00:20:24,146
What was his call sign?

218
00:20:24,914 --> 00:20:26,348
"Goose," sir.

219
00:20:26,481 --> 00:20:27,783
Tragic what happened.

220
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:29,757
Captain Mitchell was cleared of any wrongdoing.

221
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:31,619
Goose's death was an accident.

222
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:33,395
Is that how you see it, captain?

223
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:35,825
Is that how goose's son sees it?

224
00:20:38,627 --> 00:20:41,530
With all due respect, sir, I'm not a teacher.

225
00:20:41,664 --> 00:20:43,133
You were a top gun instructor before.

226
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:45,735
That was almost 30 years ago. I lasted two months.

227
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,203
It's not where I belong.

228
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:49,205
Then let me be perfectly blunt.

229
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:53,509
You were not my first choice. In fact, you weren't even on the list.

230
00:20:53,642 --> 00:20:56,645
You are here at the request of admiral kazansky.

231
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,250
Now, iceman happens to be a man I deeply admire,

232
00:21:00,383 --> 00:21:03,820
and he seems to think that you have something left to offer the Navy.

233
00:21:04,586 --> 00:21:06,555
What that is, I can't imagine.

234
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,926
You don't have to take this job.

235
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,061
But let me be clear:

236
00:21:11,128 --> 00:21:14,298
This will be your last post, captain.

237
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:19,669
You fly for top gun, or you don't fly for the Navy ever again.

238
00:21:27,877 --> 00:21:29,980
Twenty bucks you can't get three in a row.

239
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:13,391
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

240
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,228
Pete.

241
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:19,529
Penny?

242
00:22:19,662 --> 00:22:21,866
What are you doing here?

243
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:24,136
I should ask you the same thing.

244
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:27,406
- Well, that is a long story. - I doubt that.

245
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:28,539
Yeah.

246
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:30,242
Who'd you piss off this time?

247
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,843
Another admiral.

248
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:33,011
Exactly.

249
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:38,250
- Are you mad at me? - Oh, Pete.

250
00:22:38,383 --> 00:22:41,920
I can never stay mad at you. That's the problem.

251
00:22:42,054 --> 00:22:43,054
Huh.

252
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:45,724
I got to say, north island is the one place

253
00:22:45,857 --> 00:22:47,658
I thought for sure I'd never run into you.

254
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:49,694
Mmm. How long you been here?

255
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:51,595
Bought this place about three years ago.

256
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,799
- Three years? - Mm-hmm. Yeah.

257
00:22:53,932 --> 00:22:58,303
Not long after you got shipped off to the desert for pissing off that other admiral.

258
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:01,340
That was three years ago?

259
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,477
You must be in a lot of trouble.

260
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:07,313
No way you'd come back here willingly.

261
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:10,149
Well,

262
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:12,718
you'll sort it out.

263
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:14,619
No, I think, uh...

264
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:18,024
- I think this is it. - Come on, Pete.

265
00:23:18,157 --> 00:23:20,693
You've been saying that as long as I've known you.

266
00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:24,464
You said it after they busted you for taking me on a joyride in that f-18.

267
00:23:24,596 --> 00:23:27,666
Then the next thing I know, you're off to Bosnia.

268
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,837
Then Iraq. Both times.

269
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,671
You get yourself in trouble,

270
00:23:33,573 --> 00:23:36,608
iceman makes a call, and you're back in the air.

271
00:23:36,742 --> 00:23:38,312
Penny, this is different.

272
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:39,780
Pete, trust me,

273
00:23:39,913 --> 00:23:42,048
as improbable as it seems right now,

274
00:23:42,181 --> 00:23:45,885
somehow you'll be back in a fighter plane with your tail on fire.

275
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:48,521
- Penny... - Too late.

276
00:23:48,653 --> 00:23:49,856
What?

277
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:52,158
You were about to ask me what time I get off.

278
00:23:55,595 --> 00:23:57,330
Don't give me that look.

279
00:23:58,264 --> 00:24:01,467
I'm not giving you any look. I swear.

280
00:24:01,601 --> 00:24:04,237
It always ends the same with us, Pete.

281
00:24:05,605 --> 00:24:07,707
Let's not start this time.

282
00:24:12,011 --> 00:24:13,011
Okay.

283
00:24:13,546 --> 00:24:15,082

00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:45,902
This is how I find out you're stateside?

334
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:48,171
Yeah, I just thought I'd surprise you. Hmm.

335
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:53,109
I guess I surprised you back.

336
00:26:54,344 --> 00:26:56,513
- It's good to see you. - Good to see you too.

337
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:00,785
- Here you go. - Thank you.

338
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,919
Much appreciated, pops.

339
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:13,163
How about ringing me up before the evening rush?

340
00:27:27,044 --> 00:27:28,379
Bradshaw.

341
00:27:28,512 --> 00:27:30,214
As I live and breathe.

342
00:27:30,848 --> 00:27:31,848
Hangman.

343
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,285
You look... good.

344
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,221
Well, I am good, rooster.

345
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:40,391
I'm very good.

346
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:41,892
In fact,

347
00:27:42,026 --> 00:27:43,795
I am too good to be true.

348
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,296
So,

349
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:47,589
anybody know what this special detachment is all about?

350
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:51,135
No, mission's a mission. They don't confront me.

351
00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:53,971
What I want to know: Who's gonna be team leader?

352
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:56,375
And which one of y'all

353
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,511
has what it takes to follow me?

354
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,049
Hangman, the only place you'll lead anyone is an early grave.

355
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,051
Whoo!

356
00:28:13,257 --> 00:28:17,194
Well, anyone who follows you is just gonna run out of fuel.

357
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,597
But that's just you, ain't it, rooster?

358
00:28:20,898 --> 00:28:22,834
You're snug on that perch,

359
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,970
waiting for just the right moment...

360
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,640
That never comes.

That's Harvard, Yale, Omaha. Shit, that's Fritz.

371

What the hell kind of mission is this?

372
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:03,910
That's not the question we should be asking.

373

Everyone here is the best there is.

374

Who the hell are they gonna get to teach us?

375
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:14,520
It's been declined.

376
00:29:14,654 --> 00:29:16,155
You're kidding.

377
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:33,573
Hey, guys. Come on.

378
00:29:47,956 --> 00:29:49,223
How about...

379
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:52,259
That won't cover it.

380
00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:00,133
Uh, I'll come by tomorrow and bring you the cash.

381

Attention on deck!

411
00:32:53,243 --> 00:32:54,678
Morning.

412
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:57,081
Welcome to your special training detachment.

413
00:32:57,213 --> 00:32:58,381
Be seated.

414
00:32:58,515 --> 00:33:01,384
I'm admiral bates, nawdc commander.

415
00:33:01,518 --> 00:33:03,553
You're all top gun graduates.

416
00:33:04,155 --> 00:33:05,321
The elite.

417
00:33:05,455 --> 00:33:07,992
The best of the best.

418
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:10,694
That was yesterday.

419
00:33:10,828 --> 00:33:14,765
The enemy's new fifth-generation fighter has leveled the playing field.

420
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:16,533
Details are few, but you can be sure

421
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:18,836
we no longer possess the technological advantage.

422
00:33:18,969 --> 00:33:22,139
Success, now more than ever,

423
00:33:22,272 --> 00:33:25,508
comes down to the man or woman in the box.

424
00:33:26,342 --> 00:33:28,511
Half of you will make the cut.

425
00:33:28,646 --> 00:33:30,481
One of you will be named mission leader.

426
00:33:30,614 --> 00:33:33,651
The other half will remain in reserve.

427
00:33:34,753 --> 00:33:36,687
Your instructor is a top gun graduate

428
00:33:36,822 --> 00:33:39,390
with real-world experience in every mission aspect

429
00:33:39,523 --> 00:33:41,392
you will be expected to master.

430
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,528
His exploits are legendary.

431
00:33:45,696 --> 00:33:47,966
And he's considered to be one of the finest pilots

432
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,334
this program has ever produced.

433
00:33:51,435 --> 00:33:52,938
What he has to teach you

434
00:33:53,071 --> 00:33:56,708
may very well mean the difference between life and death.

435
00:33:57,441 --> 00:33:59,911
I give you captain Pete Mitchell.

436
00:34:00,045 --> 00:34:02,781
"Maverick."

437
00:34:07,486 --> 00:34:08,721
Good morning.

438
00:34:16,996 --> 00:34:18,697
The f-18 natops.

439
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:24,436
It contains everything they want you to know about your aircraft.

440
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:27,372
I'm assuming you know the book inside and out.

441
00:34:27,506 --> 00:34:28,841
- Damn right. - Damn straight.

442
00:34:28,975 --> 00:34:30,342
You got it.

443
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:39,484
So does your enemy.

444
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:41,854
And we're off.

445
00:34:42,823 --> 00:34:46,026
But what the enemy doesn't know is your limits.

446
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,394
I intend to find them,

447
00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:50,396
test them,

448
00:34:50,864 --> 00:34:52,032
push beyond.

449
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:57,004
Today we'll start with what you only think you know.

450
00:34:58,703 --> 00:35:00,472
You show me what you're made of.

451
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:06,879
Rooster.

452
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,980
Bradley.

453
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:10,917
Lieutenant bradshaw!

454
00:35:13,318 --> 00:35:14,553
Yes, sir.

455
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,322
Let's not do it like this.

456
00:35:18,224 --> 00:35:19,893
You gonna wash me out?

457
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:22,729
That'll be up to you, not me.

458
00:35:24,932 --> 00:35:26,465
Am I dismissed?

459
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,153
Good morning, aviators. This is your captain speaking.

460
00:35:46,286 --> 00:35:48,621
Welcome to basic fighter maneuvers.

461
00:35:49,823 --> 00:35:52,726
As briefed, today's exercise is dog fighting.

462
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,795
Guns only, no missiles.

463
00:35:55,796 --> 00:35:58,599
We do not go below the hard deck of 5,000 feet.

464
00:35:58,733 --> 00:36:01,602
Working as a team, you have to shoot me down, or else.

465
00:36:01,736 --> 00:36:04,939
- Or else what, sir? - Or else I shoot back.

466
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:07,942
If I shoot either one of you down, you both lose.

467
00:36:08,076 --> 00:36:11,246
This guy needs an ego check. We'll see to that.

468
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:14,058
- What say we put some skin in the game? - What do you have in mind?

469
00:36:14,182 --> 00:36:17,218
Whoever gets shot down first has to do 200 push-ups.

470
00:36:17,352 --> 00:36:19,888
Guys. That's a lot of push-ups.

471
00:36:20,021 --> 00:36:22,257
They don't call it an exercise for nothing, sir.

472
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,259
You got yourself a deal, gentlemen.

473
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,861
Fight's on. Let's turn and burn.

474
00:36:28,096 --> 00:36:30,832
Fanboy, you see him? Nothing on radar up ahead.

475
00:36:30,965 --> 00:36:32,800
He must be somewhere behind us.

476
00:36:34,336 --> 00:36:35,170
Yeah!

477
00:36:35,304 --> 00:36:36,906
- Damn it! - What the hell?

478
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,039

498
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:41,569
Down! 110.

499
00:37:43,072 --> 00:37:44,807
- That should be us down there. - 111!

500
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,275
But it's not. Down!

501
00:37:46,408 --> 00:37:49,713
And now you know a little something about rooster.

502
00:37:50,313 --> 00:37:51,948
Whoo! Wow.

503
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:54,559
Hold that tarmac down till we get back, brother, all right?

504
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:56,262
Get in there, boys.

505
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,522
- That's a kill. - Damn!

506
00:38:01,124 --> 00:38:02,491
- Smoked. - Damn it.

507
00:38:02,624 --> 00:38:05,661
It was all fun and games in that selfie, wasn't it? Down!

508
00:38:05,795 --> 00:38:06,830
Say, Phoenix.

509
00:38:06,963 --> 00:38:07,974
How's about we tell everybody

510
00:38:07,998 --> 00:38:09,733
"Bob" stands for something?

511
00:38:09,866 --> 00:38:12,111
- Other than Robert, I mean. - Don't take the bait, Bob.

512
00:38:12,135 --> 00:38:14,304
Want to know why we call him hangman?

513
00:38:14,437 --> 00:38:16,572
I got it. "Baby on board."

514
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:20,777
Shit!

515
00:38:21,778 --> 00:38:23,446
Greetings, aviators. Fight's on.

516
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:26,549
All right, Phoenix, let's take this guy out!

517
00:38:26,683 --> 00:38:27,752
Watch your back, Phoenix.

518
00:38:27,885 --> 00:38:30,021
- Break right! - Breaking right.

519
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:33,324
Where's he going?

520
00:38:33,457 --> 00:38:34,825
That's why we call him hangman.

521
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:36,693
He'll always hang you out to dry.

522
00:38:37,461 --> 00:38:38,796
Leaving your wing man.

523
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:40,689
There's a strategy I haven't seen in a while.

524
00:38:40,731 --> 00:38:43,000
He called you a man, Phoenix. You gonna take that?

525
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:44,601
So long as he doesn't call you a man.

526
00:38:44,735 --> 00:38:46,636
Talk to me, Bob. Where's Maverick?

527
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:48,705
Jesus, his nose is already coming around!

528
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:50,474
Get him off me, hangman!

529
00:38:50,607 --> 00:38:54,111
For all you folks at home, this is how you Bury a fossil.

530
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:56,881
All right, hangman. Time to teach you a lesson.

531
00:38:57,014 --> 00:38:59,050
- You're out, Phoenix. - Son of a bitch!

532
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:01,585
That's it.

533
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,231
- Let's go, mav. - Let's see what you got.

534
00:39:03,255 --> 00:39:04,688
Come get me.

535
00:39:06,158 --> 00:39:08,160
Evil be gone. Hangman's coming.

536
00:39:09,094 --> 00:39:11,695
Yeah, you're good. I'll give you that.

537
00:39:13,498 --> 00:39:16,234
♪ Meet the new boss ♪

538
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:19,004
♪ same as the old boss ♪ shit.

539
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:21,006
Phoenix, I can't see him. How close am I?

540
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:23,574
- Phoenix? - I'm dead, dickhead.

541
00:39:23,707 --> 00:39:25,544
See you in the afterlife, bag man.

542
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:29,246
Where is he? Where is he?

543
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,548
That's a kill.

544
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,684
Seventy-nine. Down. Eighty. Down.

545
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:36,287
Let's go. Who's next?

546
00:39:37,455 --> 00:39:39,291
- I got you, Omaha. - Damn it!

547
00:39:42,094 --> 00:39:44,429
- Lights out, coyote. - Copy kill.

548
00:39:44,563 --> 00:39:49,167
Down. Fifty-one. Down. Fifty-two.

549
00:39:51,803 --> 00:39:54,739
So, rooster, mind if I ask you a personal question?

550
00:39:54,873 --> 00:39:56,074
Would it matter if I did?

551
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:58,310
What's the story with you and Maverick?

552
00:39:58,443 --> 00:40:01,612
- It seems like he's got you rattled. - That's none of your business.

553
00:40:01,746 --> 00:40:03,548
Now where the hell is he?

554
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:05,649
Been here the whole time.

555
00:40:06,485 --> 00:40:08,386
Holy shit.

556
00:40:10,422 --> 00:40:11,590
You see me now?

557
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,359
Come on, let's get it over with.

558
00:40:14,827 --> 00:40:16,395
Fight's on!

559
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,632
What is with these two?

560
00:40:24,636 --> 00:40:28,341
All right, you put us here. How you gonna get yourself out?

561
00:40:28,474 --> 00:40:30,877
You can bail out anytime.

562
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,512
How low you want to go, rooster?

563
00:40:32,644 --> 00:40:35,982
I can go as low as you, sir! And that's saying something.

564
00:40:39,385 --> 00:40:41,354
What's past is past. For both of us.

565
00:40:41,487 --> 00:40:43,289
You'd like to believe that, wouldn't you?

566
00:40:43,422 --> 00:40:47,360
Hard deck is 5,000 feet, fellas. You are running out of room.

567
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:50,533
Altitude. Your strategy is about to run us into the ground.

568
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,333
- What's your move? - Altitude. Altitude.

569
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:55,002
Altitude.

570
00:40:56,436 --> 00:40:59,439
Altitude. Altitude. Altitude.

571
00:40:59,573 --> 00:41:02,142
Altitude. Altitude.

572
00:41:03,944 --> 00:41:06,880
Pull up! Pull up! Pull up! Pull up!

573
00:41:07,447 --> 00:41:08,681
Pull up! Pull up!

574
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:13,587
You got it. Don't think, just do.

575
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,224
Come on, rooster, you got him! Drop down and take the shot!

576
00:41:18,691 --> 00:41:19,860
It's too low.

577
00:41:20,693 --> 00:41:22,462
Too late. You had your chance.

578
00:41:28,535 --> 00:41:31,372
That's a kill. Knock it off.

579
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,374
Damn it!

580
00:41:33,508 --> 00:41:35,443
Same old rooster.

581
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:40,348
Go see hon do about your push-ups.

582
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,823
All right, that's enough.

583
00:41:49,957 --> 00:41:52,926
Rooster. That's enough, man.

584
00:42:06,808 --> 00:42:10,678
Breaking the hard deck, insubordination. Are you trying to get kicked out?

585
00:42:10,812 --> 00:42:12,280
Don't worry about it.

586
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:15,250
Look, I'm going on this mission.

587
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:18,777
But if you get kicked out, you leave us flying with hangman.

588
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:23,324
- Talk to me. What the hell was that? - He pulled my papers.

589
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:27,028
- What? Who? - Maverick.

590
00:42:28,062 --> 00:42:30,832
He pulled my application to the naval academy.

591
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:33,901
Set me back four years.

592
00:42:36,104 --> 00:42:37,872
Why would he do that?

593
00:42:43,245 --> 00:42:45,681
The hard deck is 5,000 feet above ground level.

594
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:48,083
A parameter is set not just for the safety of our pilots,

595
00:42:48,217 --> 00:42:49,885
but for the safety of their aircraft.

596
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:54,123
5,000 feet is not just a rule. It is a law, as immutable as gravity.

597
00:42:54,256 --> 00:42:56,925
The hard deck will be much lower for the mission, sir.

598
00:42:57,059 --> 00:43:00,095
And it will not change without my approval!

599
00:43:00,229 --> 00:43:02,097
Especially not in the middle of an exercise.

600
00:43:02,231 --> 00:43:06,035
And that cobra maneuver of yours? That could've got all three of you killed.

601
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:08,103
I never want to see that shit again.

602
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:11,373
What exactly do you suppose you were teaching, captain?

603
00:43:11,507 --> 00:43:13,885
That as good as they are, sir, they still have something to learn.

604
00:43:13,909 --> 00:43:16,621
You are talking about the best fighter pilots on the planet, captain.

605
00:43:16,645 --> 00:43:18,485
And they've been told that their entire career,

606
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:20,359
while they've been dropping bombs from a high altitude

607
00:43:20,383 --> 00:43:22,419
with little to no dog fighting.

608
00:43:22,552 --> 00:43:25,064
The parameters of this mission call for something they have never encountered.

609
00:43:25,088 --> 00:43:29,693
Okay, you have less than three weeks to teach them how to fight as a team

610
00:43:29,826 --> 00:43:31,027
and how to strike the target.

611
00:43:31,161 --> 00:43:33,196
And how to come home.

612
00:43:35,832 --> 00:43:38,068
And how to come home, sir.

613
00:43:43,406 --> 00:43:45,975
Every mission has its risks.

614
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:47,844
These pilots accept that.

615
00:43:47,977 --> 00:43:49,879
I don't, sir.

616
00:43:53,483 --> 00:43:55,151
Every morning, from this day forward,

617
00:43:55,285 --> 00:43:57,655
you will brief us on your instructional plans in writing.

618
00:43:57,789 --> 00:44:00,657
And nothing will change without my express approval.

619
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:04,361
- Including the hard deck, sir? - Especially the hard deck, captain.

620
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:07,497
Sir.

621
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:09,466
What is this?

622
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,401
It's a request to lower the hard deck, sir,

623
00:44:11,534 --> 00:44:14,014
to practice a low-level bombing run per the mission parameters.

624
00:44:19,642 --> 00:44:22,579
You could learn a thing or two about timing, captain.

625
00:44:23,213 --> 00:44:24,414
Yo, coyote.

626
00:44:24,948 --> 00:44:26,416
Take a look at this.

627
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,823
The man, the legend. There he is.

628
00:44:32,956 --> 00:44:35,192
No, no, no. Next to him.

629
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:38,195
He look familiar to you?

630
00:44:39,897 --> 00:44:41,632
What have we here?

631
00:44:42,233 --> 00:44:44,235
Bradshaw.

632
00:44:44,969 --> 00:44:46,937
As I live and breathe.

633
00:44:49,841 --> 00:44:52,543
Hey, Theo, you got big.

634
00:44:53,177 --> 00:44:54,211
Hey, mav.

635
00:45:01,552 --> 00:45:02,552
Amelia?

636
00:45:02,653 --> 00:45:04,021
I know. I got big.

637
00:45:04,155 --> 00:45:05,589
Yes.

638
00:45:06,624 --> 00:45:07,793
Bar opens at 5:00.

639
00:45:07,925 --> 00:45:10,662
No, I just came by to pay off a debt.

640
00:45:10,797 --> 00:45:12,230
Mom!

641
00:45:16,568 --> 00:45:19,671
- Hey, how's your dad? - With his wife, in Hawaii.

642
00:45:19,806 --> 00:45:21,339
Mom!

643
00:45:22,073 --> 00:45:24,609
Mav says he owes you money.

644
00:45:24,744 --> 00:45:28,013
- Oh. Don't worry about it. - I insist.

645
00:45:30,783 --> 00:45:34,720
Thank you, captain. Consider your tab closed.

646
00:45:35,687 --> 00:45:37,322
Captain? Still?

647
00:45:37,456 --> 00:45:40,325
A highly decorated captain.

648
00:45:40,459 --> 00:45:41,326
Finish up.

649
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,128
We have to get the boat to the yard.

650
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:45,163
- I can't go. - What do you mean, you can't go?

651
00:45:45,297 --> 00:45:48,501
Test tomorrow. I have to study. They only told us today.

652
00:45:48,634 --> 00:45:50,737
Well, I can't sail her alone.

653
00:45:50,871 --> 00:45:52,138
Just use the engine.

654
00:45:52,271 --> 00:45:54,540
Why are we taking her to the yard?

655
00:45:54,674 --> 00:45:56,275
To fix the engine.

656
00:45:56,409 --> 00:45:58,544
Mm-hmm. I can help.

657
00:46:04,517 --> 00:46:07,620
- Little rougher than I was expecting. - You don't say.

658
00:46:07,754 --> 00:46:11,557
Pull on the back stay. We'll de-power the sails.

659
00:46:11,691 --> 00:46:12,992
Okay.

660
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:15,026
What does that mean?

661
00:46:16,127 --> 00:46:18,263
You're supposed to be in the Navy!

662
00:46:18,396 --> 00:46:22,167
I don't sail boats, penny. I land on them.

663
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,605
It's sort of like raising the flaps on an airplane.

664
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:27,306
So how do I do that?

665
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,042
You pull on that green line up there.

666
00:46:30,176 --> 00:46:31,644
Green line.

667
00:46:34,046 --> 00:46:35,414
Yep. Pull it hard.

668
00:46:35,548 --> 00:46:38,618
Yep. Crank that winch right there,

669
00:46:38,752 --> 00:46:40,620
tighten the jib.

670
00:46:41,254 --> 00:46:43,656
- Crank it. You okay? - Yeah.

671
00:46:45,057 --> 00:46:46,259
Good.

672
00:46:47,426 --> 00:46:48,461
Now,

673
00:46:49,763 --> 00:46:51,130
you ready?

674
00:46:53,032 --> 00:46:54,634
For what?

675
00:46:54,768 --> 00:46:56,435
The afterburner.

676
00:47:16,456 --> 00:47:18,559
Now you're in the Navy.

677
00:47:40,548 --> 00:47:42,650
Thanks for helping out today.

678
00:47:44,185 --> 00:47:45,754
I'm not exactly sure I helped.

679
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:48,757
Hmm.

680
00:47:51,092 --> 00:47:52,627
Don't give me that look.

681
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:53,963
What look?

682
00:47:54,095 --> 00:47:55,831
That one.

683
00:47:59,034 --> 00:48:00,501
Good night, Pete.

684
00:48:01,102 --> 00:48:02,604
Night, penny.

685
00:48:17,954 --> 00:48:19,923
Mom, is that you?

686
00:48:20,056 --> 00:48:21,523
Yeah, it's me.

687
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:23,994
I'll make you dinner.

688
00:48:24,126 --> 00:48:25,361
Okay.

689
00:48:31,299 --> 00:48:33,701
Time is your greatest enemy.

690
00:48:34,837 --> 00:48:37,072
Phase one of the mission will be a low-level ingress

691
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,741
attacking in two-plane teams.

692
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,576
You'll fly along this narrow canyon to your target.

693
00:48:41,709 --> 00:48:45,179
Radar-guided surface-to-air missiles defend the area.

694
00:48:45,313 --> 00:48:47,916
These sams, they're lethal.

695
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,888
But they were designed to protect the skies above, not the canyon below.

696
00:48:52,022 --> 00:48:55,992
That's because the enemy knows no one is insane enough to try and fly below them.

697
00:48:56,993 --> 00:48:59,662
That's exactly what I'm gonna train you to do.

698
00:48:59,796 --> 00:49:04,166
On the day, your altitude will be 100 feet maximum.

699
00:49:04,299 --> 00:49:05,634
You exceed this altitude...

700
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:08,170
Radar will spot you

701
00:49:08,303 --> 00:49:10,673
and you're dead.

702
00:49:10,807 --> 00:49:13,208
Your airspeed will be 660 knots

703
00:49:13,843 --> 00:49:14,843
minimum.

704
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:17,147
Two and a half minutes.

705
00:49:17,279 --> 00:49:22,251
That's because fifth-generation fighters wait at an air base nearby.

706
00:49:22,384 --> 00:49:26,689
In a head-to-head with these planes in your f-18s, you're dead.

707
00:49:27,891 --> 00:49:30,593
That's why you need to get in, hit your target and be gone

708
00:49:30,728 --> 00:49:33,798
before these planes even have a chance of catching you.

709
00:49:33,931 --> 00:49:37,034
This makes time your greatest adversary.

710
00:49:38,468 --> 00:49:42,505
You'll fly a route in your nav system that simulates the canyon.

711
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:44,507
The faster you navigate this canyon,

712
00:49:44,641 --> 00:49:47,210
the harder it'll be to stay under the radar of these enemy sams.

713
00:49:47,343 --> 00:49:49,312
The tighter the turns,

714
00:49:49,446 --> 00:49:51,148
the more intensely the force of gravity

715
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:53,216
on your body multiplies...

716
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:54,885
Compressing your lungs...

717
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:57,454
Forcing the blood from your brain...

718
00:49:57,587 --> 00:49:59,724
Impairing your judgment and reaction time.

719
00:49:59,857 --> 00:50:02,292
So for today's lesson, we're gonna take it easy on you.

720
00:50:02,425 --> 00:50:05,663
- 300 feet. - Three minutes.

721
00:50:07,331 --> 00:50:08,734
Good luck.

722
00:50:16,842 --> 00:50:18,676
Time to target is one minute 30.

723
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,213
We are two seconds behind. Increase to 480 knots.

724
00:50:21,345 --> 00:50:22,781
We got to move, coyote.

725
00:50:23,481 --> 00:50:25,117
Copy. Increasing speed.

726
00:50:25,249 --> 00:50:26,517
Oh!

727
00:50:27,685 --> 00:50:28,685
Oh, shit!

728
00:50:31,857 --> 00:50:33,024
Why are they dead?

729
00:50:33,158 --> 00:50:36,128
We broke the 300-foot ceiling, and a Sam took us out.

730
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,896
No. Why are they dead?

731
00:50:38,029 --> 00:50:40,240
I slowed down and didn't give her a warning. It was my fault.

732
00:50:40,264 --> 00:50:43,345
Was there a reason you didn't communicate with your team? I was focusing on...

733
00:50:43,468 --> 00:50:46,138
One that their family will accept at the funeral.

734
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:47,471
None, sir.

735
00:50:48,472 --> 00:50:49,832
Why didn't you anticipate the turn?

736
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:51,442
You were briefed on the terrain.

737
00:50:51,575 --> 00:50:54,780
Don't tell me. Tell it to his family.

738
00:50:59,885 --> 00:51:02,453
Hangman, ease up. The canyon's getting tighter.

739
00:51:02,586 --> 00:51:05,257
Negative, payback. Increase your speed.

740
00:51:06,557 --> 00:51:10,461
- You're going too fast, man. - No harm in being ahead of schedule.

741
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:15,100
Damn it, slow down! I can't stay on the course!

742
00:51:15,233 --> 00:51:18,335
You're gonna hit the wall! Watch out! Watch out!

743
00:51:21,673 --> 00:51:24,376
- What happened? - I flew as fast as I could.

744
00:51:24,509 --> 00:51:26,311
Kind of like my ass depended on it.

745
00:51:26,444 --> 00:51:30,049
And you put your team in danger, and your wing man's dead.

746
00:51:31,184 --> 00:51:32,852
They couldn't keep up.

747
00:51:38,523 --> 00:51:41,359
Rooster, we're 20 seconds behind and dropping.

748
00:51:41,493 --> 00:51:44,096
We're fine. Speed is good.

749
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,865
Increase to 500 knots.

750
00:51:45,998 --> 00:51:48,700
- Negative, Yale. Hold your speed. - Rooster, we're late!

751
00:51:48,835 --> 00:51:51,603
We're alive. We'll make up time in the straightaway.

752
00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:53,139
We are not gonna make it.

753
00:51:53,272 --> 00:51:56,409
Just trust me. Maintain your speed. We can make it.

754
00:51:56,542 --> 00:51:58,644
Why are you dead?

755
00:51:58,779 --> 00:52:00,280
You're team leader up there.

756
00:52:00,413 --> 00:52:02,816
Why are you, why is your team dead?

757
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:05,618
Sir, he's the only one who made it to the target.

758
00:52:05,752 --> 00:52:07,754
A minute late.

759
00:52:07,888 --> 00:52:10,356
He gave enemy aircraft time to shoot him down.

760
00:52:10,489 --> 00:52:12,259
- He is dead. - You don't know that.

761
00:52:12,391 --> 00:52:15,963
You're not flying fast enough. You don't have a second to waste.

762
00:52:16,096 --> 00:52:17,764
We made it to the target.

763
00:52:17,898 --> 00:52:20,868
And superior enemy aircraft intercepted you on your way out.

764
00:52:21,001 --> 00:52:23,937
- Then it's a dogfight. - Against fifth-generation fighters.

765
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:26,751
- Yeah. We'd still have a chance. - In an f-18.

766
00:52:26,807 --> 00:52:29,343
It's not the plane, sir, it's the pilot.

767
00:52:29,475 --> 00:52:30,811
Exactly!

768
00:52:37,718 --> 00:52:40,355
There's more than one way to fly this mission.

769
00:52:40,487 --> 00:52:42,123
You really don't get it.

770
00:52:43,258 --> 00:52:46,127
On this mission, a man flies like Maverick here,

771
00:52:46,261 --> 00:52:48,162
or a man does not come back.

772
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,564
No offense intended.

773
00:52:51,332 --> 00:52:53,735
Yet somehow you always manage.

774
00:52:54,936 --> 00:52:56,670
Look, I don't mean to criticize.

775
00:52:56,804 --> 00:52:58,639
You're conservative, that's all. Lieutenant.

776
00:52:58,773 --> 00:53:03,676
We're going into combat, son, on a level no living pilot's ever seen.

777
00:53:05,078 --> 00:53:06,412
Not even him.

778
00:53:07,981 --> 00:53:10,083
That's no time to be thinking about the past.

779
00:53:13,922 --> 00:53:15,689
- What's that supposed to mean? - Rooster.

780
00:53:15,823 --> 00:53:18,534
I can't be the only one that knows that Maverick flew with his old man.

781
00:53:18,558 --> 00:53:19,205
That's enough.

782
00:53:19,217 --> 00:53:21,195
Or that Maverick was flying when his old man...

783
00:53:21,329 --> 00:53:23,798
Lieutenant, that's enough!

784
00:53:23,932 --> 00:53:25,967
- That's enough. - You son of a bitch!

785
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,501
Hey, come on!

786
00:53:27,634 --> 00:53:29,337
I'm cool, I'm cool. Hey, hey.

787
00:53:29,469 --> 00:53:31,882
- That's enough. - He's not cut out for this mission.

788
00:53:31,906 --> 00:53:34,441
That's enough! You know it.

789
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:38,146
You know I'm right.

790
00:53:44,484 --> 00:53:45,820
You're all dismissed.

791
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:51,587
Maverick.

792
00:54:53,622 --> 00:54:55,091
It's come back?

793
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:57,193
No one knows.

794
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,631
There's nothing else they can do.

795
00:55:01,766 --> 00:55:05,002
Even speaking is painful now.

796
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,777
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

797
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:33,329
Admiral.

798
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:46,143
How's my wing man?

799
00:55:57,654 --> 00:56:00,091
Please, don't worry about me.

800
00:56:00,825 --> 00:56:02,860
What can I do for you?

801
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:12,303
All right.

802
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,276
Well, rooster's still angry with me about what I did.

803
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:22,680
I thought eventually he would understand why.

804
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:26,617
I hoped he'd forgive me.

805
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:36,595
The mission is less than three weeks away.

806
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:39,030
The kid's not ready.

807
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:49,274
He doesn't want what I have to give.

808
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:51,610
Ice, please,

809
00:56:51,744 --> 00:56:53,880
don't ask me to send someone else to die.

810
00:56:54,013 --> 00:56:55,348
Please don't...

811
00:56:56,115 --> 00:56:57,917
Don't ask me to send him.

812
00:56:58,050 --> 00:56:59,752
Send me.

813
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:33,119
I don't know how.

814
00:57:46,065 --> 00:57:48,100
I'm not a teacher, ice.

815
00:57:50,403 --> 00:57:52,305
I'm a fighter pilot.

816
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,309
A naval aviator.

817
00:57:58,678 --> 00:58:00,980
It's not what I am.

818
00:58:01,948 --> 00:58:03,849
It's who I am.

819
00:58:05,418 --> 00:58:07,254
How do I teach that?

820
00:58:08,721 --> 00:58:12,259
Even if I could teach it, it's not what rooster wants.

821
00:58:12,392 --> 00:58:14,661
It's not what the Navy wants.

822
00:58:14,795 --> 00:58:17,297
That's why they canned me the last time.

823
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:23,136
The only reason I'm here is you.

824
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:32,279
If I send him on this mission,

825
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,515
he might never come home.

826
00:58:39,086 --> 00:58:41,421
And if I don't send him,

827
00:58:41,555 --> 00:58:43,458
he'll never forgive me.

828
00:58:45,994 --> 00:58:48,796
Either way, I could lose him forever.

829
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,174
I know.

830
00:59:00,808 --> 00:59:02,310
I know.

831
00:59:13,221 --> 00:59:17,158
The Navy needs Maverick.

832
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,631
The kid needs Maverick.

833
00:59:23,465 --> 00:59:26,068
That's why I fought for you.

834
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:30,372
That's why you're still here.

835
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:39,915
Thank you, ice,

836
00:59:40,049 --> 00:59:42,284
for everything.

837
00:59:46,988 --> 00:59:48,489
One last thing.

838
00:59:48,623 --> 00:59:50,793
Who's the better pilot?

839
00:59:50,958 --> 00:59:52,393
You or me?

840
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:57,866

01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,638
- What is this? - This is dogfight football.

Offense and defense at the same time.

Who's winning?

867
01:02:09,066 --> 01:02:11,602
I think they stopped keeping score a while ago.

868
01:02:11,735 --> 01:02:14,705
This detachment still has some training to complete, captain.

869
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,141
- Every available minute matters. - Yes, sir.

870
01:02:17,274 --> 01:02:19,376
So why are we out here playing games?

871
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:21,645
You said to create a team, sir.

872
01:02:23,013 --> 01:02:24,249

Should I go? Before Amelia gets back?

880
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,222
- She'll be at her friend's house tonight. - Oh, good.

881
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:14,094
You and Amelia, you seem...

882
01:04:16,463 --> 01:04:18,933
A lot closer than when I last saw you.

883
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:21,635
- Yeah. Yeah, we are. - How do you manage?

884
01:04:23,737 --> 01:04:25,706
Well,

885
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:29,376
you know, she always wanted more freedom than I thought she was ready for.

886
01:04:29,509 --> 01:04:32,546
Hmm. Where'd she get that from, I wonder?

887
01:04:36,017 --> 01:04:37,584
I guess I realized

888
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:40,587
I also had to trust her.

889
01:04:41,856 --> 01:04:45,192
Let her make some of her own mistakes sometimes.

890
01:04:47,028 --> 01:04:48,896
Not an easy choice. Mmm.

891
01:04:52,868 --> 01:04:55,269
Is that what happened with rooster?

892
01:04:58,573 --> 01:05:01,609
I pulled his papers from the naval academy.

893
01:05:04,412 --> 01:05:06,414
Took years off his career.

894
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:13,655
Why?

895
01:05:16,157 --> 01:05:20,194
His mother never wanted him to fly, not after what happened to goose.

896
01:05:22,597 --> 01:05:26,068
She made me promise before she died, so...

897
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,369
Does rooster know that?

898
01:05:31,573 --> 01:05:34,844
He will always resent me for what I did.

899
01:05:36,612 --> 01:05:39,415
Why should he resent her too?

900
01:05:43,552 --> 01:05:45,889
Not an easy choice. Hmm.

901
01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:50,927
I was trying to be the father he lost.

902
01:05:53,963 --> 01:05:55,197
I just...

903
01:05:57,666 --> 01:06:00,235
I wish I would've done it better.

904
01:06:02,204 --> 01:06:05,307
But the truth is...

905
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:09,612
I didn't think he was ready.

906
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:14,852
Is he ready now?

907
01:06:17,454 --> 01:06:19,757
Mom, I'm home!

908
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:23,593
I thought you were staying at Karen's tonight.

909
01:06:23,727 --> 01:06:26,463
Karen's sick. And I've got homework to do.

910
01:06:26,596 --> 01:06:28,866
- I should go. - You should go.

911
01:06:28,999 --> 01:06:32,401
- Have you had dinner yet? - Not yet. You wanna go out?

912
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:35,404
No, it's okay. I'll make you something.

913
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:37,372
I'll be down in a sec!

914
01:06:37,506 --> 01:06:39,708
- Wait! Not that way. - What?

915
01:06:41,211 --> 01:06:43,313
Look, I have an example to set.

916
01:06:43,446 --> 01:06:45,950
I can't be bringing guys home on a first date.

917
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:47,584
This is not our first date.

918
01:06:48,485 --> 01:06:50,353
You know what I mean.

919
01:06:52,923 --> 01:06:53,958
Okay.

920
01:06:55,059 --> 01:06:56,861
Fine.

921
01:06:56,994 --> 01:06:59,295
But this is the last time I go out your window.

922
01:06:59,429 --> 01:07:00,931
We'll see.

923
01:07:01,065 --> 01:07:03,067
No. No, I mean it.

924
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,368
I'm never gonna leave you again.

925
01:07:07,138 --> 01:07:08,571
Oh, shut up.

926
01:07:08,705 --> 01:07:10,841
Go on, get out of here.

927
01:07:24,256 --> 01:07:26,457
Just don't break her heart again.

928
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:39,070
Good morning.

929
01:07:39,204 --> 01:07:41,305
The uranium enrichment plant that is your target

930
01:07:41,438 --> 01:07:43,741
will be operational earlier than expected.

931
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:47,678
Raw uranium will be delivered to the plant in ten days' time.

932
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:50,749
As a result, your mission has been moved up one week

933
01:07:50,882 --> 01:07:54,318
in order to avoid contaminating the target valley with radiation.

934
01:07:54,451 --> 01:07:57,455
Sir, no one here has successfully flown a low-level course.

935
01:07:57,589 --> 01:07:59,759
Nevertheless, you've been ordered to move on.

936
01:08:00,893 --> 01:08:01,928
Captain.

937
01:08:04,729 --> 01:08:06,966
We have one week left to focus on phase two.

938
01:08:07,099 --> 01:08:08,968
It's the most difficult stage of the mission.

939
01:08:09,101 --> 01:08:10,837
It's a pop-up strike with a steep dive,

940
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:14,339
requiring nothing less than two consecutive miracles.

941
01:08:15,308 --> 01:08:16,541
Two pairs of f-18s will fly

942
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:18,144
in a welded wing formation.

943
01:08:18,277 --> 01:08:22,048
Teamwork. Precise coordination of these aircraft is essential

944
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,884
to both the mission's success and your survival.

945
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:27,719
As you know, the plant rests between two mountains.

946
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:32,792
On final approach, you'll invert directly into a steep dive.

947
01:08:32,925 --> 01:08:35,896
This allows you to maintain the lowest possible altitude

948
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:38,899
and the only possible attack angle.

949
01:08:42,269 --> 01:08:47,206
Your target is an impact point less than three meters wide.

950
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:49,342
The two-seat aircraft will paint the target

951
01:08:49,474 --> 01:08:51,710
with a laser bull's-eye.

952
01:08:51,844 --> 01:08:53,678
The first pair will breach the reactor

953
01:08:53,813 --> 01:08:57,482
by dropping a laser-guided bomb on an exposed ventilation hatch.

954
01:08:57,616 --> 01:09:00,518
This will create an opening for the second pair.

955
01:09:00,652 --> 01:09:02,454
That's miracle number one.

956
01:09:04,257 --> 01:09:07,293
The second team will deliver the kill shot...

957
01:09:08,627 --> 01:09:10,696
And destroy the target.

958
01:09:11,664 --> 01:09:13,166
That's miracle number two.

959
01:09:14,467 --> 01:09:16,870
If either team misses the target...

960
01:09:18,872 --> 01:09:21,241
- That's a miss. - The mission is a failure.

961
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:22,642
Damn it!

962
01:09:22,776 --> 01:09:25,245
Egress is a steep high-g climb out

963
01:09:25,379 --> 01:09:27,047
to avoid hitting this mountain.

964
01:09:29,149 --> 01:09:32,518
A steep climb at that speed, you're pulling at least eight g's.

965
01:09:32,652 --> 01:09:33,987
Nine, minimum.

966
01:09:34,121 --> 01:09:36,823
The stress limit of the f-18's airframe is 7.5.

967
01:09:36,957 --> 01:09:38,491
That's the accepted limit.

968
01:09:38,624 --> 01:09:40,693
To survive this mission, you'll pull beyond that,

969
01:09:40,827 --> 01:09:43,764
even if it means bending your airframe.

970
01:09:43,897 --> 01:09:48,069
You'll be pulling so hard, you'll weigh close to 2,000 pounds,

971
01:09:48,202 --> 01:09:50,838
your skull crushing your spine...

972
01:09:50,972 --> 01:09:54,175
Your lungs imploding like an elephant's sitting on your chest,

973
01:09:54,309 --> 01:09:57,979
fighting with everything you have just to keep from blacking out.

974
01:09:59,914 --> 01:10:02,750
And this is where you'll be at your most vulnerable.

975
01:10:03,483 --> 01:10:06,120
This is coffin corner.

976
01:10:06,254 --> 01:10:08,790
Assuming you avoid crashing into this mountain,

977
01:10:08,923 --> 01:10:12,726
you'll climb straight up into enemy radar while losing all of your airspeed.

978
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:16,197
Within seconds, you'll be fired upon by enemy sams.

979
01:10:17,365 --> 01:10:20,201
You've all faced sustained g's before, but this...

980
01:10:20,335 --> 01:10:24,206
This is gonna take you and your aircraft to the breaking point.

981
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:27,076
Sir, is this even achievable?

982
01:10:27,209 --> 01:10:29,078
The answer to that question

983
01:10:29,211 --> 01:10:31,746
will come down to the pilot in the box.

984
01:10:41,156 --> 01:10:43,292
- Talk to me, Bob. - We are 12 seconds late on target.

985
01:10:43,425 --> 01:10:46,328
- We gotta move! We gotta move! - Copy. Try to stay with me.

986
01:10:49,365 --> 01:10:51,800
Huh? Wait, who's that?

987
01:10:52,734 --> 01:10:54,279
Blue team, you've been spotted.

988
01:10:54,303 --> 01:10:56,604
- Shit, it's Maverick. - What the hell is he doing here?

989
01:10:56,738 --> 01:11:00,009
I'm a bandit on course to intercept. Blue team, what are you gonna do?

990
01:11:00,142 --> 01:11:03,412
He's 20 miles left. Ten o'clock. 700 knots closure.

991
01:11:03,544 --> 01:11:05,147
Your call. What do you want to do?

992
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,983
Continue. We're close. Stay on target.

993
01:11:08,117 --> 01:11:11,220
- He's swinging around to the north! - Stand by for pop-up.

994
01:11:11,353 --> 01:11:14,555
- Be ready on that laser, Bob. - Copy. I'm on it.

995
01:11:15,824 --> 01:11:17,525
Blue team, bandit is still closing.

996
01:11:17,658 --> 01:11:18,726
Popping now.

997
01:11:24,933 --> 01:11:26,969
Talk to me, Bob. Where's Maverick?

998
01:11:27,102 --> 01:11:29,570
He's five miles out. He's coming fast.

999
01:11:35,044 --> 01:11:38,181
- Target's in sight. - Where's my laser, Bob?

1000
01:11:38,314 --> 01:11:41,751
Dead eye! Dead eye! It's no good. Sorry, I can't get a lock.

1001
01:11:41,885 --> 01:11:43,987
We're out of time. I'm dropping blind.

1002
01:11:47,157 --> 01:11:48,724
Damn it, missed!

1003
01:11:59,269 --> 01:12:01,109
That's tone.

1004
01:12:01,171 --> 01:12:03,605
- Maverick's got missile lock on us. - Shit! We're dead.

1005
01:12:04,374 --> 01:12:05,775
Blue team, that's a fail.

1006
01:12:05,909 --> 01:12:07,110
Level out, coyote.

1007
01:12:09,611 --> 01:12:11,781
Coyote? Do you copy?

1008
01:12:14,417 --> 01:12:16,353
Coyote, come in.

1009
01:12:16,487 --> 01:12:18,355
Coyote, level wings.

1010
01:12:18,489 --> 01:12:19,890
Oh, god. He's in g-loc.

1011
01:12:20,024 --> 01:12:23,127
Coyote? Coyote?

1012
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:25,863
- He's gonna burn in! - I'm going after him.

1013
01:12:28,799 --> 01:12:31,202
Come on. Give me tone, give me tone, give me tone.

1014
01:12:31,335 --> 01:12:34,839
Snap out of it, coyote. Come on! Come on!

1015
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:40,211
Come on, coyote, come on. Come on!

1016
01:12:40,344 --> 01:12:42,489
- Damn it! Coyote! Coyote! - Pull up!

1017
01:12:42,513 --> 01:12:45,648
- Coyote! Coyote! - Pull up! Pull up!

1018
01:12:50,588 --> 01:12:52,157
Coyote, you okay? You okay?

1019
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:55,293
I'm okay. I'm good.

1020
01:12:56,061 --> 01:12:59,164
Good. Good. That's enough for today.

1021
01:13:01,299 --> 01:13:02,400
That was close.

1022
01:13:02,534 --> 01:13:04,069
Too close.

1023
01:13:04,769 --> 01:13:06,838
Bird strike! Bird strike!

1024
01:13:06,972 --> 01:13:08,940
Bird strike!

1025
01:13:11,343 --> 01:13:14,312
- Phoenix, left engine's on fire! - Climbing.

1026
01:13:16,081 --> 01:13:18,616
Throttling back. Shutting off fuel to left engine.

1027
01:13:18,748 --> 01:13:20,683
Extinguishing fire.

1028
01:13:21,819 --> 01:13:23,686
Right engine is out!

1029
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:25,489
It's still spinning. Trying to restart it.

1030
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:28,960
Phoenix, it's on fire.

1031
01:13:29,094 --> 01:13:30,896
- Don't start. - Throttling up.

1032
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:33,765
Oh, my god.

1033
01:13:36,835 --> 01:13:39,104
- We're on fire! We're on fire! - Damn it!

1034
01:13:39,237 --> 01:13:42,274
- Engine fire. Right. - Extinguishing right engine.

1035
01:13:45,277 --> 01:13:47,179
Phoenix, Bob, punch out, punch out!

1036
01:13:47,312 --> 01:13:49,381
Warning lights everywhere! Hydraulic failure!

1037
01:13:49,514 --> 01:13:51,483
- Flight controls. - I can't control it.

1038
01:13:51,616 --> 01:13:54,136
We're going down, Phoenix! We're going in! We're going in!

1039
01:13:54,219 --> 01:13:56,855
You can't save it. Eject, eject!

1040
01:13:56,988 --> 01:13:58,156
Eject, eject, eject!

1041
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:01,293
Altitude. Altitude.

1042
01:14:22,481 --> 01:14:25,618
They'll keep Phoenix and Bob in the hospital overnight for observation.

1043
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:27,386
They're gonna be okay.

1044
01:14:31,424 --> 01:14:32,925
That's good.

1045
01:14:36,028 --> 01:14:37,997
I've never lost a wing man.

1046
01:14:38,564 --> 01:14:40,132
You're lucky.

1047
01:14:40,266 --> 01:14:42,301
Fly long enough, it'll happen.

1048
01:14:44,905 --> 01:14:46,873
There will be others.

1049
01:14:49,243 --> 01:14:51,478
Easy for you to say. No wife.

1050
01:14:53,413 --> 01:14:55,182
No kids.

1051
01:14:55,315 --> 01:14:58,085
Nobody to mourn you when you burn in.

1052
01:15:01,255 --> 01:15:02,756
Go home.

1053
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:05,225
Just get some sleep.

1054
01:15:07,427 --> 01:15:09,730
Why'd you pull my papers at the academy?

1055
01:15:09,863 --> 01:15:11,798
Why did you stand in my way?

1056
01:15:14,034 --> 01:15:15,435
You weren't ready.

1057
01:15:15,569 --> 01:15:17,037
Ready for what?

1058
01:15:17,871 --> 01:15:20,108
- Huh? Ready to fly like you? - No.

1059
01:15:20,241 --> 01:15:21,876
Ready to forget the book.

1060
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:24,512
Trust your instincts. Don't think, just do.

1061
01:15:24,646 --> 01:15:27,815
You think up there, you're dead. Believe me.

1062
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:30,785
My dad believed in you.

1063
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,922
I'm not gonna make the same mistake.

1064
01:15:41,428 --> 01:15:43,063
Maverick.

1065
01:15:53,273 --> 01:15:56,411
Ready, aim, fire.

1066
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,350
Ready,

1067
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,052
aim,

1068
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:05,887
fire.

1069
01:16:15,697 --> 01:16:17,098
Ready,

1070
01:16:17,899 --> 01:16:19,334
aim,

1071
01:16:19,467 --> 01:16:20,935
fire.

1072
01:16:54,336 --> 01:16:57,406
I can only imagine what you must be feeling right now.

1073
01:16:57,539 --> 01:17:00,810
Take some time. Whatever you need.

1074
01:17:00,943 --> 01:17:03,379
I appreciate that, sir, but there is no time. The mission...

1075
01:17:03,512 --> 01:17:06,014
I'll be taking over the training from here.

1076
01:17:06,783 --> 01:17:07,983
Sir?

1077
01:17:09,118 --> 01:17:10,797
We both know you didn't want this job, captain.

1078
01:17:10,821 --> 01:17:13,261
- Sir, they're not ready. - It was your job to get them ready.

1079
01:17:13,356 --> 01:17:16,659
Sir, they have to believe that this mission can be flown.

1080
01:17:16,794 --> 01:17:20,029
And all you've managed to do is teach them that it can't.

1081
01:17:20,831 --> 01:17:22,867
- Sir... - You're grounded, captain.

1082
01:17:22,999 --> 01:17:24,634
Permanently.

1083
01:17:28,304 --> 01:17:30,140
- Sir... - That is all.

1084
01:17:48,358 --> 01:17:49,392
I heard.

1085
01:17:51,594 --> 01:17:52,962
I'm sorry.

1086
01:17:53,663 --> 01:17:55,398
What are you gonna do?

1087
01:17:56,499 --> 01:17:57,967
Ice is gone.

1088
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:02,172
What choice do I have?

1089
01:18:03,173 --> 01:18:05,708
You'll have to find a way back on your own.

1090
01:18:05,843 --> 01:18:07,277
No, penny.

1091
01:18:08,879 --> 01:18:10,380
I'm out.

1092
01:18:11,948 --> 01:18:13,383
This is over.

1093
01:18:13,818 --> 01:18:14,852
Pete.

1094
01:18:14,984 --> 01:18:17,353
If you lost your wing man up there,

1095
01:18:18,021 --> 01:18:19,722
you'd keep fighting.

1096
01:18:19,857 --> 01:18:21,291
You wouldn't just give up.

1097
01:18:21,926 --> 01:18:24,128
Those are your pilots.

1098
01:18:25,129 --> 01:18:27,933
If anything happens to them,

1099
01:18:28,065 --> 01:18:30,401
you'll never forgive yourself.

1100
01:18:34,205 --> 01:18:36,340
I don't know what to do.

1101
01:18:40,244 --> 01:18:42,012
But you'll find a way.

1102
01:18:44,114 --> 01:18:45,516
I know you will.

1103
01:18:47,451 --> 01:18:49,653
Captain Mitchell is no longer your instructor.

1104
01:18:49,788 --> 01:18:52,990
And as of today, there are new mission parameters.

1105
01:18:53,123 --> 01:18:55,493
Time to target is now four minutes.

1106
01:18:55,626 --> 01:18:58,195
You'll be entering the valley level at reduced speed.

1107
01:18:58,329 --> 01:19:01,032
Not to exceed 420 knots.

1108
01:19:01,166 --> 01:19:03,870
Sir, won't we be giving their planes time to intercept?

1109
01:19:04,002 --> 01:19:06,682
Well, lieutenant, you have a fighting chance against enemy aircraft.

1110
01:19:06,738 --> 01:19:09,741
What are the odds of surviving a head-on collision with a mountain?

1111
01:19:09,876 --> 01:19:12,611
You'll be attacking the target from a higher altitude,

1112
01:19:12,744 --> 01:19:14,079
level with the north wall.

1113
01:19:14,212 --> 01:19:16,314
Gonna be a little harder to keep your lase on target,

1114
01:19:16,448 --> 01:19:18,316
but you will avoid the high-g climb out.

1115
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:21,052
We'll be sitting ducks for enemy missiles.

1116
01:19:26,157 --> 01:19:27,559
Who the hell is that?

1117
01:19:28,995 --> 01:19:31,998
Maverick to range control. Entering point Alpha.

1118
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:34,065
Confirm green range.

1119
01:19:34,199 --> 01:19:38,337
Uh, Maverick, range control, uh, green range is confirmed.

1120
01:19:38,471 --> 01:19:41,707
I don't see an event scheduled for you, sir.

1121
01:19:41,842 --> 01:19:43,810
Well, I'm going anyway.

1122
01:19:43,944 --> 01:19:45,077
Nice.

1123
01:19:45,211 --> 01:19:46,980
Setting time to target:

1124
01:19:47,113 --> 01:19:48,916
Two minutes 15 seconds.

1125
01:19:49,048 --> 01:19:50,583
2:15? That's impossible.

1126
01:19:50,716 --> 01:19:53,586
Final attack point. Maverick's inbound.

1127
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,522
Popping in three, two, one.

1128
01:22:00,883 --> 01:22:02,117
Bombs away.

1129
01:22:19,802 --> 01:22:22,403
Bull's-eye! Holy shit!

1130
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:24,639
Yes.

1131
01:22:27,308 --> 01:22:28,342
Damn.

1132
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:43,993
You have put me in a difficult position, captain.

1133
01:22:44,127 --> 01:22:47,864
On the one hand, you have demonstrated that this mission can be flown.

1134
01:22:47,997 --> 01:22:50,666
Perhaps the only way it can be survived.

1135
01:22:51,801 --> 01:22:53,169
On the other hand,

1136
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:56,106
you did it by stealing a multimillion-dollar military aircraft

1137
01:22:56,238 --> 01:22:59,575
and flying it in such a manner that it may never be airworthy again.

1138
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:03,645
Iceman is no longer here to protect you.

1139
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:06,415
I have everything I need to have you court-martialed

1140
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:08,584
and dishonorably discharged.

1141
01:23:09,185 --> 01:23:10,719
So what do I do?

1142
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,654
Risk the lives of my pilots

1143
01:23:12,789 --> 01:23:14,824
and perhaps the success of this mission

1144
01:23:16,192 --> 01:23:17,426
or...

1145
01:23:18,828 --> 01:23:20,430
Risk my career

1146
01:23:21,264 --> 01:23:23,299
by appointing you team leader?

1147
01:23:26,603 --> 01:23:31,341
Sir... I think the admiral's asking a rhetorical question, captain.

1148
01:25:12,011 --> 01:25:13,712
Talk to me, goose.

1149
01:25:16,748 --> 01:25:18,583
Captain Mitchell!

1150
01:25:25,324 --> 01:25:27,093
You're where you belong.

1151
01:25:31,998 --> 01:25:33,632
Make us proud.

1152
01:25:59,492 --> 01:26:01,828
It has been an honor flying with you.

1153
01:26:02,829 --> 01:26:06,732
Each one of you represents the best of the best.

1154
01:26:06,867 --> 01:26:10,170
This is a very specific mission.

1155
01:26:10,304 --> 01:26:13,673
My choice is a reflection of that and nothing more.

1156
01:26:13,807 --> 01:26:15,909
Choose your two foxtrot teams.

1157
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:19,079
Payback and fanboy.

1158
01:26:20,113 --> 01:26:21,614
Phoenix and Bob.

1159
01:26:25,619 --> 01:26:27,621
And your wing man.

1160
01:26:31,893 --> 01:26:32,927
Rooster.

1161
01:26:37,131 --> 01:26:39,499
The rest of you will stand by on the carrier

1162
01:26:39,633 --> 01:26:42,770
for any reserve role that's required.

1163
01:26:43,438 --> 01:26:44,806
Dismissed.

1164
01:26:52,212 --> 01:26:55,315
Your target is a clear and present threat.

1165
01:26:56,615 --> 01:27:00,486
A secret uranium enrichment site under rogue state control.

1166
01:27:00,619 --> 01:27:02,489
It's an underground bunker,

1167
01:27:02,622 --> 01:27:04,691
tucked between these two mountains.

1168
01:27:06,227 --> 01:27:09,596
Your route of ingress is heavily defended by surface-to-air missiles

1169
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:12,066
backed up by fifth-generation fighters.

1170
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,936
Once your f-18 strike team crosses the border,

1171
01:27:15,069 --> 01:27:17,005
tomahawk missiles from the USS Leyte Gulf

1172
01:27:17,138 --> 01:27:21,042
will launch a synchronized strike on the enemy's airfield here.

1173
01:27:22,076 --> 01:27:24,644
This will knock out their runway.

1174
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:29,317
But you'll have to contend with any planes already in the air.

1175
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:32,753
The moment those tomahawks hit, the enemy will know you're coming.

1176
01:27:33,687 --> 01:27:34,889
Your time to target

1177
01:27:35,023 --> 01:27:37,960
will be two minutes and 30 seconds.

1178
01:27:39,261 --> 01:27:41,196
Any longer than that, and you will be exposed

1179
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:44,266
to any aircraft the tomahawks may have missed.

1180
01:27:47,336 --> 01:27:50,105
This is what you've all been training for.

1181
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,674
Come home safely.

1182
01:28:08,190 --> 01:28:10,025
You give 'em hell!

1183
01:28:22,505 --> 01:28:23,739
Sir.

1184
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:25,141
Sir?

1185
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:28,344
I...

1186
01:28:31,047 --> 01:28:32,982
I just want to say...

1187
01:28:41,891 --> 01:28:43,326
We'll talk

1188
01:28:44,693 --> 01:28:46,229
when we get back.

1189
01:28:52,269 --> 01:28:54,138
Hey, Bradley! Bradley!

1190
01:28:55,206 --> 01:28:56,240
Hey.

1191
01:28:59,609 --> 01:29:01,178
You got this.

1192
01:29:09,486 --> 01:29:10,719
Maverick.

1193
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:14,257
Maverick?

1194
01:29:15,525 --> 01:29:17,693
Hey, you with me?

1195
01:29:18,928 --> 01:29:21,030
I don't like that look, mav.

1196
01:29:23,665 --> 01:29:25,301
It's the only one I got.

1197
01:29:29,773 --> 01:29:31,275
Thank you.

1198
01:29:32,642 --> 01:29:34,644
If I don't see you again, hon do,

1199
01:29:34,778 --> 01:29:36,280
thank you.

1200
01:29:43,854 --> 01:29:45,956
It's been an honor, captain.

1201
01:30:18,857 --> 01:30:21,826
Dagger one, up and ready on catapult one.

1202
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,995
Dagger spare standing by.

1203
01:30:24,129 --> 01:30:25,897
Dagger four, up and ready.

1204
01:30:26,031 --> 01:30:27,566
Dagger three, up and ready.

1205
01:30:27,698 --> 01:30:30,035
Dagger two, up and ready.

1206
01:30:30,902 --> 01:30:32,413
Support assets airborne.

1207
01:30:32,437 --> 01:30:33,605
Strike package ready.

1208
01:30:33,737 --> 01:30:36,208
Standing by for launch decision.

1209
01:30:36,341 --> 01:30:37,375
Send them.

1210
01:30:57,863 --> 01:30:59,332
Dagger two away.

1211
01:31:00,299 --> 01:31:02,201
Dagger three away.

1212
01:31:02,335 --> 01:31:04,303
Dagger four away.

1213
01:31:15,081 --> 01:31:17,850
Comanche, dagger one. Standby check in.

1214
01:31:18,918 --> 01:31:20,219
Comanche 11, set.

1215
01:31:20,353 --> 01:31:22,688
Picture clean. Recommend dagger continue.

1216
01:31:22,822 --> 01:31:25,024
Copy. Daggers descending below radar.

1217
01:31:44,577 --> 01:31:47,480
Daggers now below radar. Switching to e-2 picture.

1218
01:31:55,855 --> 01:31:58,258
Here we go. Enemy territory up ahead.

1219
01:31:58,392 --> 01:32:01,295
Feet dry in 60 seconds. Comanche, dagger one. Picture.

1220
01:32:01,428 --> 01:32:04,398
Comanche. Picture clean. Decision is yours.

1221
01:32:04,531 --> 01:32:05,999
Copy.

1222
01:32:14,007 --> 01:32:15,342
Dagger attack.

1223
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,715
Tomahawks airborne.

1224
01:32:21,848 --> 01:32:24,151
No turning back now.

1225
01:32:29,723 --> 01:32:31,992
Daggers, assume attack formation.

1226
01:32:40,635 --> 01:32:42,570
Daggers set. Proceeding to target.

1227
01:32:42,704 --> 01:32:47,442
Two minutes and 30 seconds in three, two, one, Mark.

1228
01:32:47,575 --> 01:32:48,777
- Two Mark. - Three Mark.

1229
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:50,044
Four Mark.

1230
01:32:54,182 --> 01:32:55,950
Going in.

1231
01:33:11,233 --> 01:33:13,635
First Sam site overhead.

1232
01:33:17,906 --> 01:33:19,346
Looks like we're clear on radar, mav.

1233
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:21,410
Let's not take it for granted.

1234
01:33:24,781 --> 01:33:26,882
More sams! Three o'clock high!

1235
01:33:29,218 --> 01:33:31,453
- We got two minutes to target. - Copy.

1236
01:33:31,587 --> 01:33:34,590
We're a few seconds behind, rooster. We got to move.

1237
01:33:34,723 --> 01:33:38,626
Thirty seconds to tomahawk impact on enemy airstrip.

1238
01:33:46,033 --> 01:33:47,746
Dagger, comanche.

1239
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:49,981
We're picking up two bandits. Single group, two contacts.

1240
01:33:50,005 --> 01:33:53,208
- Where the hell'd they come from? - Long-range patrol?

1241
01:33:57,980 --> 01:33:59,515
Comanche, what's their heading?

1242
01:33:59,648 --> 01:34:01,750
Bull's-eye 090, 50, tacked southwest.

1243
01:34:01,885 --> 01:34:04,086
They're headed away from us. They don't know we're here.

1244
01:34:04,219 --> 01:34:06,121
The second those tomahawks hit the air base,

1245
01:34:06,255 --> 01:34:08,323
those bandits are gonna move to defend the target.

1246
01:34:08,457 --> 01:34:11,360
We have to get there before they do. Increase speed.

1247
01:34:12,428 --> 01:34:15,097
We got you, mav. Don't wait for me.

1248
01:34:20,636 --> 01:34:23,772
Sir, daggers two and four are behind schedule.

1249
01:34:23,907 --> 01:34:26,242
Time to target, one minute 20.

1250
01:34:26,376 --> 01:34:29,446
Tomahawk impact in three, two...

1251
01:34:33,516 --> 01:34:36,319
Impact. Enemy runway is destroyed.

1252
01:34:36,986 --> 01:34:38,688
They know we're coming now.

1253
01:34:41,124 --> 01:34:44,160
Bandits are switching course to defend the target.

1254
01:34:44,294 --> 01:34:45,628
Rooster, where are you?

1255
01:34:47,163 --> 01:34:48,809
Come on, rooster. Bandits inbound.

1256
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:51,401
We got to make up time now. Let's turn and burn.

1257
01:34:59,142 --> 01:35:00,410
Heads up, Phoenix.

1258
01:35:04,014 --> 01:35:05,349
Whoa!

1259
01:35:09,821 --> 01:35:12,756
Sir, bandits are two minutes from target.

1260
01:35:12,891 --> 01:35:14,258
Daggers are one minute from target.

1261
01:35:14,391 --> 01:35:17,061
Come on, rooster. Move it or lose it.

1262
01:35:18,830 --> 01:35:21,632
Guys, we're falling behind. We really gotta move.

1263
01:35:21,765 --> 01:35:23,634
If we don't increase our speed right now,

1264
01:35:23,767 --> 01:35:26,737
those bandits are gonna be waiting for us when we reach the target.

1265
01:35:28,539 --> 01:35:29,740
Talk to me, dad.

1266
01:35:30,976 --> 01:35:32,309
Come on, kid, you can do it.

1267
01:35:32,443 --> 01:35:34,712
Don't think, just do.

1268
01:35:43,088 --> 01:35:44,589
Jesus, rooster, not that fast!

1269
01:35:44,723 --> 01:35:47,392
That's it, kid, that's it. All right, let's go.

1270
01:35:51,228 --> 01:35:52,763
Damn, rooster, take it easy.

1271
01:35:52,898 --> 01:35:56,200
Sir, dagger two is reengaging.

1272
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:59,069
All right, now hit your target and come home.

1273
01:36:03,173 --> 01:36:05,676
Thirty seconds to target. Bob, check your laser.

1274
01:36:05,810 --> 01:36:09,547
Air-to-ground check complete. Laser code verified, 1688.

1275
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,782
Laser is a go!

1276
01:36:13,018 --> 01:36:14,552
Watch your heads.

1277
01:36:16,121 --> 01:36:17,422
Holy shit! Shit!

1278
01:36:17,556 --> 01:36:19,691
- Payback, you with me? - Right behind you.

1279
01:36:20,559 --> 01:36:22,360
Phoenix, stand by for pop-up strike.

1280
01:36:22,494 --> 01:36:24,162
Dagger three in position.

1281
01:36:24,897 --> 01:36:27,465
Popping in three, two, one.

1282
01:36:55,261 --> 01:36:57,697
- Get me eyes on that target, Bob. - Dagger three.

1283
01:36:58,764 --> 01:37:00,566
- Stand by, mav. - Come on, Bob, come on.

1284
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:02,535
Stand by.

1285
01:37:02,668 --> 01:37:05,705
- I've got it. Captured! - Target acquired. Bombs away.

1286
01:37:26,525 --> 01:37:29,964
We've got impact! Check, direct hit! Direct hit!

1287
01:37:30,098 --> 01:37:31,899
That's miracle number one.

1288
01:37:32,499 --> 01:37:33,968
Dagger two, status.

1289
01:37:34,102 --> 01:37:35,736
Almost there, mav. Almost there.

1290
01:37:38,238 --> 01:37:39,640
Fanboy, where's my laser?

1291
01:37:39,773 --> 01:37:42,442
Rooster, there's something wrong with this laser!

1292
01:37:42,576 --> 01:37:44,078
Shit! Dead eye, dead eye, dead eye!

1293
01:37:44,211 --> 01:37:46,513
Come on, guys, we're running out of time. Get it online!

1294
01:37:46,647 --> 01:37:48,247
- I'm trying! - Come on, fanboy!

1295
01:37:48,281 --> 01:37:50,250
Nearly there! Nearly there!

1296
01:37:59,093 --> 01:38:01,437
- Come on, fanboy, get it online. - There's no time. I'm dropping blind.

1297
01:38:01,461 --> 01:38:03,563
- Rooster, I got this! - No time. Pull up.

1298
01:38:03,697 --> 01:38:05,867
- Wait! - Bombs away! Bombs away!

1299
01:38:18,445 --> 01:38:20,747
Bull's-eye, bull's-eye, bull's-eye!

1300
01:38:24,484 --> 01:38:25,652
Miracle number two.

1301
01:38:25,787 --> 01:38:27,421
Now they're in coffin corner.

1302
01:38:27,554 --> 01:38:29,857
We're not out of this yet.

1303
01:38:31,692 --> 01:38:33,260
Here it comes.

1304
01:38:35,863 --> 01:38:38,132
Radar warning! Smoke in the air. Phoenix, break right.

1305
01:38:38,265 --> 01:38:40,434
Emergency jettison. Dagger three defending.

1306
01:38:40,567 --> 01:38:42,335
Here comes another one!

1307
01:38:42,469 --> 01:38:44,439
Dagger one defending.

1308
01:38:50,445 --> 01:38:51,746
Rooster, status.

1309
01:38:59,888 --> 01:39:00,923
Oh, my god.

1310
01:39:02,858 --> 01:39:04,625
Smoke in the air! Smoke in the air!

1311
01:39:05,693 --> 01:39:07,830
- Break right, payback! - Breaking right.

1312
01:39:08,931 --> 01:39:10,933
Oh, my god, here they come!

1313
01:39:11,066 --> 01:39:12,600
Sam on your six, rooster!

1314
01:39:13,936 --> 01:39:15,470
Deploying countermeasures.

1315
01:39:18,107 --> 01:39:19,742
Negative contact.

1316
01:39:21,543 --> 01:39:22,846
Dagger one defending.

1317
01:39:23,947 --> 01:39:26,783
- Talk to me, Bob. - Break right, Phoenix! Break right! Mav!

1318
01:39:26,916 --> 01:39:28,751
Nine o'clock! Nine o'clock!

1319
01:39:29,786 --> 01:39:31,286
Rooster, two more on your six.

1320
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:33,022
Dagger two, defending.

1321
01:39:37,459 --> 01:39:39,661
- Payback, Sam on your nose. - Dagger four defending.

1322
01:39:39,796 --> 01:39:41,506
- Rooster, tally, seven o'clock! - Talk to me, Bob!

1323
01:39:41,530 --> 01:39:42,875
- On our six! - Dagger two defending.

1324
01:39:42,899 --> 01:39:44,642
- Phoenix, break right! - I see it!

1325
01:39:52,108 --> 01:39:53,642
Dagger two defending.

1326
01:39:54,710 --> 01:39:55,979
Shit, I'm out of flares!

1327
01:39:56,112 --> 01:39:58,115
Rooster, evade, evade!

1328
01:39:58,249 --> 01:40:00,885
I can't shake 'em! They're on me! They're on me!

1329
01:40:10,961 --> 01:40:12,695
Mav! No!

1330
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:18,002
Dagger one is hit! I repeat, dagger one is hit!

1331
01:40:18,135 --> 01:40:19,469
Maverick is down.

1332
01:40:19,602 --> 01:40:20,871
Dagger one, status.

1333
01:40:21,005 --> 01:40:22,437
Status!

1334
01:40:22,571 --> 01:40:24,606
Anyone see him? Does anyone see him?

1335
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:27,076
- Dagger one, come in! - I didn't see a parachute.

1336
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:28,644
We have to circle back.

1337
01:40:28,777 --> 01:40:31,313
Comanche. Bandits inbound. Single group, hot.

1338
01:40:31,446 --> 01:40:33,082
Recommend dagger flow south.

1339
01:40:34,084 --> 01:40:35,953
One minute to intercept.

1340
01:40:38,923 --> 01:40:42,092
Get 'em back to the carrier now. All daggers flow to ecp.

1341
01:40:42,226 --> 01:40:44,306
You have bandits headed for you. What about Maverick?

1342
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:47,164
Tell him there's nothing he can do for Maverick, not in a goddamn f-18.

1343
01:40:47,298 --> 01:40:50,600
Dagger spare request permission to launch and fly air cover.

1344
01:40:52,602 --> 01:40:53,938
Negative, spare.

1345
01:40:54,737 --> 01:40:55,840
Launch search and rescue.

1346
01:40:55,973 --> 01:40:57,416
Negative. Not with bandits in the air.

1347
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:58,785
But, sir, Maverick is still out there.

1348
01:40:58,809 --> 01:41:01,111
We are not losing anyone else today.

1349
01:41:03,047 --> 01:41:04,380
Get 'em home now.

1350
01:41:04,514 --> 01:41:07,084
Dagger, you are not to engage.

1351
01:41:07,218 --> 01:41:09,019
Repeat, do not engage.

1352
01:41:09,153 --> 01:41:12,356
Dagger two, return to carrier. Acknowledge.

1353
01:41:12,489 --> 01:41:13,524
Acknowledge.

1354
01:41:13,657 --> 01:41:15,894
Rooster, those bandits are closing.

1355
01:41:16,027 --> 01:41:17,062
We can't go back.

1356
01:41:17,195 --> 01:41:20,131
Rooster, he's gone.

1357
01:41:21,632 --> 01:41:23,467
Maverick's gone.

1358
01:42:53,625 --> 01:42:54,860
Oh, no, no.

1359
01:43:01,168 --> 01:43:03,036
Dagger two is hit.

1360
01:43:04,137 --> 01:43:05,238
Dagger two is hit.

1361
01:43:06,672 --> 01:43:08,541
Dagger two, come in.

1362
01:43:09,742 --> 01:43:11,812
Dagger two, do you copy?

1363
01:43:12,778 --> 01:43:14,815
Dagger two, come in.

1364
01:43:40,008 --> 01:43:41,008
You all right?

1365
01:43:41,042 --> 01:43:42,944
Yeah, I'm good. You all right?

1366
01:43:45,179 --> 01:43:47,382
- What the hell? - What are you doing here?

1367
01:43:47,514 --> 01:43:49,716
What am I doing here? You think I took that missile

1368
01:43:49,851 --> 01:43:51,386
so you could be down here with me?

1369
01:43:51,518 --> 01:43:53,254
You should be back on the carrier by now!

1370
01:43:53,388 --> 01:43:54,889
I saved your life!

1371
01:43:55,023 --> 01:43:58,059
I saved your life. That's the whole point.

1372
01:43:58,192 --> 01:44:00,161
What the hell were you even thinking?

1373
01:44:00,294 --> 01:44:02,596
You told me not to think!

1374
01:44:19,114 --> 01:44:20,215
Well,

1375
01:44:21,649 --> 01:44:22,985
it's good to see you.

1376
01:44:25,454 --> 01:44:27,056
It's good to see you too.

1377
01:44:30,826 --> 01:44:32,627
So what's the plan?

1378
01:44:43,505 --> 01:44:44,907
You're not serious.

1379
01:44:59,922 --> 01:45:02,024
You've got to be shitting me.

1380
01:45:03,992 --> 01:45:05,461
An f-14?

1381
01:45:05,593 --> 01:45:07,162
I shot down three migs in one of those.

1382
01:45:07,296 --> 01:45:10,065
We don't even know if that bag of ass can fly.

1383
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,803
- Let's find out. - Mav!

1384
01:45:16,472 --> 01:45:17,705
Okay.

1385
01:45:26,915 --> 01:45:30,019
- There's guys up there, mav. - Yeah.

1386
01:45:30,153 --> 01:45:33,123
- There's more over there. - Okay.

1387
01:45:33,256 --> 01:45:35,859
- Let's start running. - Yeah, run. Run.

1388
01:45:45,001 --> 01:45:47,937
Once... once I give you the signal for air,

1389
01:45:48,071 --> 01:45:50,706
you're gonna flip this switch until the needle gets to 120.

1390
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:52,208
When the engine starts,

1391
01:45:52,342 --> 01:45:54,643
you got to pull out the pins and disconnect everything.

1392
01:45:54,776 --> 01:45:56,446
- You understand? - Yeah.

1393
01:45:58,647 --> 01:45:59,883
Yes!

1394
01:46:01,551 --> 01:46:03,920
Once I'm up, stow the ladder.

1395
01:46:11,629 --> 01:46:13,898
Okay. Wow.

1396
01:46:14,798 --> 01:46:16,901
It's been a minute, huh, mav?

1397
01:46:45,363 --> 01:46:48,766
Oh, my god. This thing is so old.

1398
01:46:49,534 --> 01:46:50,768
All right.

1399
01:46:55,607 --> 01:46:57,275
- Canopy? - Clear.

1400
01:47:15,426 --> 01:47:17,760
Both runways are cratered.

1401
01:47:17,895 --> 01:47:20,198
How we gonna get this museum piece in the air?

1402
01:47:30,275 --> 01:47:32,043
Why are the wings coming out, mav?

1403
01:47:38,350 --> 01:47:41,052
Mav, this is a taxiway, not a runway.

1404
01:47:41,186 --> 01:47:44,656
This is a very short taxiway, mav.

1405
01:47:44,788 --> 01:47:46,191
Just hang on.

1406
01:47:47,425 --> 01:47:48,960
Holy shit!

1407
01:47:54,765 --> 01:47:55,934
Come on, come on, come on.

1408
01:47:56,067 --> 01:47:58,004
Needle's alive. Come on.

1409
01:48:00,439 --> 01:48:02,774
- Mav? - That's it. Come on, come on!

1410
01:48:02,908 --> 01:48:04,176
All right.

1411
01:48:04,877 --> 01:48:07,113
- Mav! - Here we go.

1412
01:48:08,447 --> 01:48:10,016
Holy shit.

1413
01:48:23,396 --> 01:48:26,599
Sir, we're receiving a signal from rooster's esat.

1414
01:48:26,732 --> 01:48:28,601
But there seems to be a malfunction.

1415
01:48:28,734 --> 01:48:30,236
- Have you lost him? - No, sir.

1416
01:48:31,137 --> 01:48:32,571
He's supersonic.

1417
01:48:33,105 --> 01:48:34,374
He's airborne.

1418
01:48:35,542 --> 01:48:37,444
- In what? - Sir.

1419
01:48:37,577 --> 01:48:42,182
Over watch reports an f-14 tomcat is airborne and on course for our position.

1420
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:45,585
Can't be. It can't be!

1421
01:48:47,321 --> 01:48:48,355
Maverick.

1422
01:48:50,324 --> 01:48:52,726
Okay, rooster, get us in touch with the boat.

1423
01:48:52,859 --> 01:48:54,328
I'm working on it.

1424
01:48:54,461 --> 01:48:57,564
Radio's out. No radar. Everything's dead back here.

1425
01:48:57,698 --> 01:49:00,802
- What do I do? Talk me through it. - Okay, first the radio.

1426
01:49:00,934 --> 01:49:02,804
Throw the, uh...

1427
01:49:02,936 --> 01:49:06,106
The uhf-2 circuit breaker. Try that.

1428
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:09,142
There's 300 breakers back here. Anything more specific?

1429
01:49:09,276 --> 01:49:11,379
I don't know. That was your dad's department.

1430
01:49:11,512 --> 01:49:13,114
I'll figure it out.

1431
01:49:16,150 --> 01:49:18,519
Mav, tally two, 5:00 low.

1432
01:49:23,757 --> 01:49:25,092
What do we do?

1433
01:49:25,759 --> 01:49:27,627
Okay, listen. Just be cool.

1434
01:49:27,761 --> 01:49:30,430
If they knew who we were, we'd be dead already.

1435
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:33,934
Well, here they come.

1436
01:49:34,067 --> 01:49:37,371
- What's your plan? - Just put your mask on.

1437
01:49:38,338 --> 01:49:41,041
Remember, we're on the same team.

1438
01:49:43,577 --> 01:49:45,445
Just wave and smile.

1439
01:49:46,046 --> 01:49:47,648
Just wave and smile.

1440
01:49:54,522 --> 01:49:56,290
What's that signal? What's he saying?

1441
01:49:56,424 --> 01:49:59,894
No idea. I have no idea what he's saying.

1442
01:50:00,027 --> 01:50:03,965
- What about that one? Any idea? - No, never seen that one either.

1443
01:50:06,802 --> 01:50:11,072
Oh, shit. His wing man is moving into weapons envelope.

1444
01:50:11,706 --> 01:50:13,207
All right, listen up.

1445
01:50:13,341 --> 01:50:15,910
When I tell you, you grab those rings above your head.

1446
01:50:16,043 --> 01:50:17,712
That's the ejection handle.

1447
01:50:18,646 --> 01:50:21,115
Mav, can we outrun these guys?

1448
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:23,985
Not their missiles and guns.

1449
01:50:28,223 --> 01:50:30,159
Then it's a dogfight.

1450
01:50:30,292 --> 01:50:33,395
An f-14 against fifth-gen fighters?

1451
01:50:34,596 --> 01:50:37,199
It's not the plane, it's the pilot.

1452
01:50:38,434 --> 01:50:40,602
You'd go after 'em if I wasn't here.

1453
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:43,105
But you are here.

1454
01:50:43,705 --> 01:50:45,207
Come on, mav.

1455
01:50:46,108 --> 01:50:47,476
Don't think.

1456
01:50:48,644 --> 01:50:49,711
Just do.

1457
01:51:05,195 --> 01:51:07,397
Tell me when you see smoke in the air.

1458
01:51:11,468 --> 01:51:13,970
- Smoke in the air! Smoke in the air! - Hang on.

1459
01:51:16,406 --> 01:51:19,242
Yeah, mav! Splash one! Splash one!

1460
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:26,349
Here comes another one.

1461
01:51:28,853 --> 01:51:31,120
Rooster, flares! Now, now, now!

1462
01:51:34,224 --> 01:51:35,658
Splitting the throttles.

1463
01:51:37,759 --> 01:51:39,095
Coming around.

1464
01:51:43,132 --> 01:51:44,845
Give me tone, give me tone.

1465
01:51:44,869 --> 01:51:47,470
You got him, mav! You got him! Taking the shot.

1466
01:51:53,443 --> 01:51:54,677
What the...

1467
01:51:55,445 --> 01:51:57,780
Holy shit! What the fuck was that?

1468
01:51:59,082 --> 01:52:01,217
Hang on. We gotta get low.

1469
01:52:01,351 --> 01:52:04,020
The terrain will confuse his targeting system.

1470
01:52:05,890 --> 01:52:07,056
Here he comes!

1471
01:52:19,470 --> 01:52:21,338
Talk to me, rooster. Where is he?

1472
01:52:21,472 --> 01:52:23,440
He's still on us!

1473
01:52:30,347 --> 01:52:32,650
- We took a hit! We took a hit! - Damn it!

1474
01:52:37,488 --> 01:52:39,958
- Come on, mav. Do some of that pilot shit. - Brace yourself.

1475
01:52:50,601 --> 01:52:51,669
Holy shit.

1476
01:52:58,476 --> 01:53:00,596
I got tone. Taking the shot.

1477
01:53:04,917 --> 01:53:06,351
Damn it!

1478
01:53:07,118 --> 01:53:10,121
Out of missiles. Switching to guns.

1479
01:53:15,794 --> 01:53:17,128
Come on, mav, come on.

1480
01:53:19,431 --> 01:53:21,366
- You got him, mav! - It's not over yet.

1481
01:53:25,704 --> 01:53:27,807
- One last chance. - You can do this.

1482
01:53:28,909 --> 01:53:30,811
Come on, Maverick.

1483
01:53:40,152 --> 01:53:42,321
Yes! Splash two!

1484
01:53:53,131 --> 01:53:54,800
- Mav, I got the radio on. - Outstanding.

1485
01:53:54,934 --> 01:53:57,003
- Get us in touch with the boat. - Copy that.

1486
01:53:59,270 --> 01:54:00,672
Oh, my god.

1487
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:04,409
Where the hell is this guy?

1488
01:54:05,443 --> 01:54:07,346
He's on our nose.

1489
01:54:09,715 --> 01:54:11,852
Damn it, we're out of ammo.

1490
01:54:13,719 --> 01:54:16,422
Smoke in the air! Rooster, flares!

1491
01:54:18,825 --> 01:54:20,292
That was close.

1492
01:54:22,428 --> 01:54:24,597
We're out of flares, mav.

1493
01:54:28,534 --> 01:54:30,736
Shit, he's already on us.

1494
01:54:34,975 --> 01:54:37,376
This is not good.

1495
01:54:45,285 --> 01:54:47,487
- We took another hit! - No, no, no, no, no!

1496
01:54:52,093 --> 01:54:54,261
We can't take much more of this.

1497
01:54:54,394 --> 01:54:56,130
We can't outrun this guy. We got to eject.

1498
01:54:56,263 --> 01:54:57,531
- What? - We need altitude.

1499
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:59,666
Pull the ejection handles the second I tell you.

1500
01:54:59,801 --> 01:55:01,969
- Mav, wait! - Rooster, there's no other way.

1501
01:55:05,139 --> 01:55:06,540
Eject, eject, eject!

1502
01:55:06,673 --> 01:55:09,443
Rooster, pull the handle! Eject!

1503
01:55:09,576 --> 01:55:11,478
It's not working!

1504
01:55:21,322 --> 01:55:24,559
Mav!

1505
01:55:25,526 --> 01:55:27,228
I'm sorry.

1506
01:55:28,396 --> 01:55:30,231
I'm sorry, goose.

1507
01:55:42,577 --> 01:55:44,378
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

1508
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:46,514
This is your savior speaking.

1509
01:55:46,647 --> 01:55:48,449
Please fasten your seat belts,

1510
01:55:48,583 --> 01:55:51,120
return your tray tables to their locked and upright positions...

1511
01:55:52,353 --> 01:55:54,789
And prepare for landing.

1512
01:55:57,026 --> 01:55:59,162
Hey, hangman, you look good.

1513
01:55:59,294 --> 01:56:02,798
I am good, rooster. I'm very good.

1514
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:06,468
I'll see you back on deck.

1515
01:56:27,956 --> 01:56:30,558
Maverick is downwind. No front landing gear.

1516
01:56:30,691 --> 01:56:32,895
No tail hook. Pull the cable and raise the barricade.

1517
01:56:33,028 --> 01:56:35,531
Foul deck! Foul deck! Raise the barricade!

1518
01:56:36,365 --> 01:56:37,901
Go!

1519
01:57:00,089 --> 01:57:02,324
Please don't tell me we lost an engine.

1520
01:57:02,457 --> 01:57:05,394
- All right, I won't tell you that. - Okay.

1521
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:30,386
You good?

1522
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:32,488
Yeah. I'm good.

1523
01:58:17,801 --> 01:58:20,638
- Chalked yourself another kill. - That makes two.

1524
01:58:21,206 --> 01:58:22,406
Mav has five.

1525
01:58:22,539 --> 01:58:24,074
Makes him an ace.

1526
01:58:42,027 --> 01:58:44,595
Captain Mitchell! Captain Mitchell!

1527
01:58:51,236 --> 01:58:52,670
Sir.

1528
01:58:59,911 --> 01:59:01,847
Thank you for saving my life.

1529
01:59:02,949 --> 01:59:05,084
It's what my dad would've done.

1530
01:59:44,257 --> 01:59:45,491
Hey, mav.

1531
01:59:46,326 --> 01:59:47,626
Jimmy.

1532
01:59:48,561 --> 01:59:49,795
Is, uh...

1533
01:59:50,496 --> 01:59:51,832
Is penny around?

1534
01:59:51,965 --> 01:59:55,601
Uh, she took Amelia on a sailing trip.

1535
01:59:57,838 --> 01:59:59,973
Did she say when she'd be back?

1536
02:00:00,107 --> 02:00:01,942
You know, she didn't.

1537
02:00:04,177 --> 02:00:05,946
Can I get you anything?

1538
02:00:19,193 --> 02:00:20,228
Get in there.
