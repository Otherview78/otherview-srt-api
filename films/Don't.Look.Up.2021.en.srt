1
00:00:06,296 --> 00:00:07,881
Perfect.

2
00:00:09,382 --> 00:00:12,844
No. Not like that.

3
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:16,890
-Voila. -Voila.

4
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:19,017
It's nice, right?

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,477
Beautiful.

6
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:22,229
It's nice.

7
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:24,856
Your father is talented.

8
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:27,525
It's so mysterious.

9
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:30,278
His pictures are both powerful and sad.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,282
I can see why you're obsessed with him.

11
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:35,700
I'm not obsessed.

12
00:00:35,742 --> 00:00:38,328
You've hung his photos everywhere.

13
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:41,164
He's my father. Why shouldn't I hang them?

14
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:44,960
They're everywhere. It's too much.

15
00:00:46,836 --> 00:00:47,879
Where is he?

16
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:49,047
My father?

17
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:53,093
I'm not sure. Maybe San Diego or Florida.

18
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:57,138
That's a step down, isn't it.

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,642
To go from Paris and New York to San Diego.

20
00:01:00,684 --> 00:01:03,102
I said he could be in Florida.

21
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:05,564
Florida is even worse.

22
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:08,525
Don't be an asshole!

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,574
I should meet him one day.

24
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,327
Really? If you behave.

25
00:01:19,452 --> 00:01:21,454
He could be my father-in-law one day.

26
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:23,164
You wanna get married?

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,959
Maybe not.

28
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:28,878
Come on. I'm kidding.

29
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:33,216
He could take our wedding photos.

30
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,281
Everything okay, sir?

31
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:40,742
No. It's disgusting.

32
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:41,784
I'm sorry, sir.

33
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:43,995
The sauce tastes like detergent.

34
00:02:44,704 --> 00:02:46,998
Is the cook blind?

35
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:48,458
Let me get you something else.

36
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:52,211
I've lost my appetite. This is the worst meal I've ever had.

37
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:53,796
At least take our menu.

38
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:57,801
If I wanted food this bad, I would have visited my sister.

39
00:02:58,718 --> 00:03:00,512
We lost another customer.

40
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:03,473
-What? Why? -It's the sauce this time.

41
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:08,103
- What's wrong with it? - Taste it. It's gross.

42
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:12,565
Oh God! What happened here?

43
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:14,776
-What's the problem? -What's the problem?

44
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:17,278
- It tastes like a dead man's balls.

45
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,988
Lucy. Stop.

46
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:22,450
This is the second time today. I can't make a living like this.

47
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:23,868
I'm sorry. Lucy, okay.

48
00:03:23,952 --> 00:03:25,578
Your apology isn't going to feed my kid.

49
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:27,831
Lucy, relax.

50
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:29,332
I just need fresh cream.

51
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:32,252
You don't need cream. You need cooking lessons.

52
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:34,170
Back off! It was a mistake!

53
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:36,840
Your existence is a mistake.

54
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:38,643
This is your mother's fault for having you.

55
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:41,344
- Lucy, please stop. - Why don't you fire him?

56
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:43,972
Go back to work. I'll take care of this.

57
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:46,474
There are no tables. The floor is empty.

58
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:47,475
Go!

59
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:50,854
No one wants to eat here anymore. I don't blame them.

60
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:52,355
Are you okay?

61
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,199
What have you done?

62
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:03,908
Nothing.

63
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:06,953
- Did you cut yourself? - It happened awhile back.

64
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:09,288
-What happened? -I wrecked my motorcycle.

65
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,081
When?

66
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:11,875
The It's okay.

67
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,334
Can you work?

68
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:15,587
Of course. I'll be right there.

69
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:17,922
Don't get blood in the food.

70
00:04:19,507 --> 00:04:23,219
Maybe blood would improve your cooking.

71
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,668
Hey man. Pardon me.

72
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,340
Do you have any spare change?

73
00:05:00,548 --> 00:05:02,592
Back up, man.

74
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:07,388
I'm trying to get to Brooklyn.

75
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:10,350
I'm staying with my friend.

76
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:12,185
I have nothing.

77
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,938
I just need a little... a little...

78
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:21,027
I just need a few dollars.

79
00:05:21,152 --> 00:05:23,488
I said, "I have nothing."

80
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,335
I brought you some fish.

81
00:06:20,753 --> 00:06:22,839
It's fresh from the restaurant.

82
00:06:24,632 --> 00:06:26,968
Did you find an apartment?

83
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:30,013
I've been working. I haven't had the time.

84
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:32,307
When will you find one?

85
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:35,768
I'll put this in the fridge.

86
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,480
Stick it up your ass.

87
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:50,325
Hello dad.

88
00:06:50,491 --> 00:06:51,451
How are you?

89
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:52,994
I'm fine and you?

90
00:06:53,953 --> 00:06:56,205
I'm coming to New York.

91
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:01,461
When will you be here?

92
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:04,005
Monday?

93
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:06,799
I'm afraid I won't be here.

94
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:12,013
I'm leaving for Stockholm tomorrow.

95
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:13,765
For work.

96
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:19,103
I can't cancel. It's an important meeting.

97
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:27,445
Two days and then I fly to Berlin to meet a friend.

98
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:33,576
Yes, he'll be here. It could be weird for you.

99
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:38,998
He can't afford a hotel. He's not

100
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,710
even making his motorcycle payments.

101
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:47,298
I pay for everything. It's a catastrophe.

102
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,343
I don't want to talk about it.

103
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,848
So you're coming Monday?

104
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:59,894
I'll leave the key at the front desk.

105
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:02,313
Come and go as you please.

106
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,947
Okay, dad. I love you.

107
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:48,568
- Shit, why did you do that? - Stop pretending.

108
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:53,614
My father is coming to visit.

109
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:56,868
-How long? -As long as he wants.

110
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:59,495
Can't he stay somewhere else?

111
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:01,914
Why should he? This is my home.

112
00:09:02,373 --> 00:09:03,791
When is he coming?

113
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,334
Monday.

114
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:11,882
That still hasn't healed?

115
00:09:11,924 --> 00:09:15,344
No. It reopened at work.

116
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,267
You should probably see a doctor, no?

117
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:24,562
Do you want kids?

118
00:09:29,442 --> 00:09:31,569
I don't know. Not at the moment.

119
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:33,196
Possibly one day.

120
00:09:33,988 --> 00:09:35,198
I'm in no rush.

121
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:41,579
No rush? Does that mean one year? Two?

122
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:45,750
When do you think you'll be ready?

123
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:48,920
I haven't given it any thought.

124
00:09:49,003 --> 00:09:51,005
So who knows?

125
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:07,355
You're not saying good-bye?

126
00:10:07,897 --> 00:10:12,401
When I get back you better be gone.

127
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:14,779
Back up.

128
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:18,157
I'm leaving. Don't touch me.

129
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:22,536
Listen closely. If you leave anything. I'll burn it.

130
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:25,414
Why are you treating me this way?

131
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:27,041
Please stop.

132
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:40,596
-Excuse me? -Yes.

133
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:43,141
I wanted a rare steak.

134
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:44,016
It's not rare?

135
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:46,894
It's like a diamond.

136
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:49,981
-I'm sorry. -I'm sorry too.

137
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:51,816
Another complain.

138
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:53,859
What is it this time?

139
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:56,070
The meat is overcooked and the potatoes are too salty.

140
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:58,197
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:00,533
You can't keep repeating that.

142
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:01,742
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

143
00:11:01,784 --> 00:11:03,870
Stop being sorry and learn how to cook!

144
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:05,913
Stop talking to me like that!

145
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:07,874
Things aren't easy for me.

146
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:09,292
I have a fucking child at home.

147
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,544
Why do you let him cook here?

148
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:13,129
Send him to McDonalds.

149
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:15,714
Lucy, I'll talk to him.

150
00:11:15,756 --> 00:11:18,467
There's no need. I've said all I needed to say.

151
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,887
Hey loser!

152
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,429
Stop ruining my orders!

153
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:24,140
Stop pressuring me!

154
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:29,520
The problem? You hired an ass to cook.

155
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:31,856
-I'm not the ass, okay? -Yes, you are!

156
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:49,207
Good night.

157
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:51,375
-Nice dreams, Andy. -Good night, Andy.

158
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:52,710
Don't drink all my beer.

159
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:53,502
Too late.

160
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:57,256
I think Andy's going to close the restaurant.

161
00:11:57,298 --> 00:11:58,465
Why do you think that?

162
00:11:58,507 --> 00:12:01,177
People are talking. You haven't noticed?

163
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,304
If I lose this job, I'm in deep shit.

164
00:12:03,346 --> 00:12:06,057
You'll find another one.

165
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:08,100
-I need money now. -That's true.

166
00:12:08,184 --> 00:12:09,685
-Did you find an apartment? -No.

167
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:12,688
The West Village is so expensive.

168
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,108
-The West Village? -Sure, why not?

169
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:18,653
You'll never afford a place there.

170
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:21,280
Try Sunset Park.

171
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:22,698
I don't like Brooklyn.

172
00:12:22,782 --> 00:12:25,284
Try Ridgewood. It's nice there.

173
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:27,620
-No way. -Why not?

174
00:12:27,787 --> 00:12:31,374
My friend lives there. She takes care of people.

175
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,000
She could take you in.

176
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:36,545
Take me in? What are you suggesting?

177
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:39,298
She helps people in need.

178
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:43,886
Desperate people, beaten wives, the disabled.

179
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,224
That's what you think of me? I'm not a tramp.

180
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:51,560
That's not what I meant.

181
00:12:51,686 --> 00:12:55,273
But if you need help she's there for you.

182
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:21,924
That's a beautiful bike, man.

183
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:23,259
Thank you.

184
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,802
Really beautiful.

185
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:26,804
I used to have the same bike.

186
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:28,514
Exactly like this.

187
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,308
Same color. Same style.

188
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:32,310
How fast does it go?

189
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:34,687
-It's fast. -I know it is.

190
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:38,316
I love to go fast.

191
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:41,861
You wanna sell it?

192
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,404
It's not for sale.

193
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:46,657
Everything has a price.

194
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:50,870
- I said it's not for sale. - Just wait, dude...

195
00:13:51,912 --> 00:13:54,707
Name your price. I'll buy it tonight.

196
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,335
Did you not hear me? I said "no."

197
00:13:57,418 --> 00:14:00,629
I'm keeping it. Sorry.

198
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:06,344
Wait a second.

199
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,561
- Wait. What's your hurry? - I need to get home.

200
00:14:15,644 --> 00:14:19,023
Wait, let's discuss. I love this bike.

201
00:14:19,106 --> 00:14:20,900
It's in my blood.

202
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:23,819
Sorry, I have to go.

203
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:27,823
You live in a fancy place. You're lucky to have money.

204
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:31,994
Let's negotiate. I'll give you a ride, huh?

205
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,371
Come on!

206
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:34,705
Shit.

207
00:14:58,938 --> 00:15:00,481
Hello?

208
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:11,951
But I do speak French.

209
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:14,703
Your French is excellent.

210
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:15,579
Thank you.

211
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,543
I was but I decided to come early.

212
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:22,878
I didn't have a chance to clean up.

213
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:27,424
Don't bother. A little dust never hurt anyone.

214
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:29,343
We all come from dust.

215
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:31,554
And to dust we'll all return.

216
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:35,808
-Who is your friend? -I'm so sorry...

217
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:39,186
He lives here now but he'll be moving out soon.

218
00:15:40,312 --> 00:15:43,774
I'm sorry, we were hungry, so we raided the fridge.

219
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:45,484
It's okay.

220
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:48,612
But whoever cooked that fish should be murdered.

221
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:51,657
Come. Have some wine.

222
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,033
No. I'm very tired.

223
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:56,203
Wine is good for the heart.

224
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,791
You dated Marie for years. We've only just met.

225
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,378
- You know we broke up, right? - Yes, she told me.

226
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:07,256
It's sad to see people break up.

227
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:09,508
But I knew it wouldn't last.

228
00:16:09,592 --> 00:16:12,303
That's why I was in no hurry to meet.

229
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:14,513
I'm still friends with my second wife.

230
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:15,764
Really?

231
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:18,184
How many wives have you had?

232
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:19,894
Three

233
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:22,271
I never married.

234
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:23,397
Good choice

235
00:16:23,522 --> 00:16:26,150
Are you friends with your third wife?

236
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:29,403
Why not?

237
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:30,988
She's a whore.

238
00:16:31,113 --> 00:16:32,781
What about the first?

239
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:36,452
-No. -Why not?

240
00:16:36,744 --> 00:16:38,078
She died.

241
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:40,748
Sorry for your loss.

242
00:16:41,624 --> 00:16:42,291
Yes.

243
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:49,965
We'd still be together if she was alive.

244
00:16:50,132 --> 00:16:51,884
How did she die?

245
00:16:53,427 --> 00:16:55,179
Cancer.

246
00:16:55,262 --> 00:16:57,765
Tumor in the brain.

247
00:17:02,394 --> 00:17:05,272
I was holding her hand when she died.

248
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:13,822
Don't move.

249
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:15,991
Stay still.

250
00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:18,410
Just like that.

251
00:17:22,498 --> 00:17:24,625
Where do you think you're going?

252
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:25,876
To bed.

253
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,627
Where?

254
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:27,836
To my room.

255
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:29,838
I'm sleeping up there.

256
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:31,257
No, that's my room.

257
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,884
It most certainly is not. It's my daughter's room.

258
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:35,928
You're on the couch.

259
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:40,766
You've been sleeping there anyway so you can stay there.

260
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:43,269
You're both sitting here. I want to go to sleep.

261
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:47,189
Fine. We'll move and you can go to sleep.

262
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:50,067
Come on, Roger. Let's talk over there.

263
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:52,111
Bring the wine too, please.

264
00:17:52,194 --> 00:17:56,532
Now you can make up your bed...

265
00:17:56,615 --> 00:17:58,826
...on the couch.

266
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:12,089
-Do you mind if I eat this? -Help yourself.

267
00:18:16,635 --> 00:18:19,054
You've got such an interesting face.

268
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:22,308
So did John Merrick.

269
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,643
Your face is tragic.

270
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:30,316
I can see you've experienced pain.

271
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:32,484
In fact...

272
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:35,988
...the second I saw you, I wanted to take your picture.

273
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:38,157
That's why I introduced myself.

274
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:40,868
That's why you invited me here? To take a photo?

275
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:41,744
No.

276
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:44,705
I had other things in mind.

277
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:46,540
You don't know each other?

278
00:18:46,832 --> 00:18:48,542
Yeah, we know each other.

279
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:50,419
You said you just met today.

280
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:55,090
I know who he is. He was once well-known.

281
00:18:55,132 --> 00:18:57,009
- I'm still well-known. - I guess that's true.

282
00:18:57,051 --> 00:19:00,304
Marie wouldn't like you bringing strangers home.

283
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:03,557
Marie already lives with a stranger.

284
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:06,185
- What does that mean? - You know what it means.

285
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,353
No more, no less.

286
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:11,482
You're not the person she thought you were.

287
00:19:11,565 --> 00:19:13,901
-That's cruel. -Oh really? Cruel?

288
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:15,986
It's cruel that you still live here.

289
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:19,239
It's cruel that you only think of yourself.

290
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:23,661
If you had any dignity, you would move out.

291
00:19:25,746 --> 00:19:27,915
Now forget the fish and look at me.

292
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:37,174
Are you going to take it?

293
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:40,386
I can't.

294
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:42,513
-It disappeared. -Disappeared?

295
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:45,724
It's gone. That look, your wife, the loss.

296
00:19:45,974 --> 00:19:46,975
The look?

297
00:19:47,184 --> 00:19:50,562
The memory of your deceased wife.

298
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:52,940
You were haunted by it.

299
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,316
Now it's gone.

300
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:58,654
I told you, that's my room.

301
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:00,698
I'm just going to the toilet.

302
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:03,033
The toilet is clogged.

303
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,244
-Clogged? -It wasn't me.

304
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:08,247
Yes, it's clogged.

305
00:20:08,414 --> 00:20:10,791
-Unclog it. -How?

306
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,711
With the fucking plunger.

307
00:20:13,877 --> 00:20:16,046
I can't do that.

308
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:23,011
This happens a lot. My shits are very big.

309
00:20:23,262 --> 00:20:26,890
Perhaps it's my diet. Maybe genetics.

310
00:20:27,057 --> 00:20:28,851
But I'm not ashamed, Roger.

311
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:31,270
In fact, I'm proud.

312
00:21:41,882 --> 00:21:44,510
Good morning, sleepy head.

313
00:21:44,676 --> 00:21:46,178
Did you sleep well?

314
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:47,596
Fine.

315
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:50,641
-You snore. -What?

316
00:21:50,724 --> 00:21:53,060
You snore.

317
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,436
I know.

318
00:21:54,561 --> 00:21:56,730
It could be sleep apnea.

319
00:21:56,814 --> 00:21:59,024
You could die in your sleep.

320
00:21:59,191 --> 00:22:00,901
You should see a doctor.

321
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,571
You were sitting there watching me sleep?

322
00:22:04,947 --> 00:22:06,114
Not at all.

323
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:08,742
I was admiring my photo.

324
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:14,206
It pleases me that Marie hung so many of my pieces.

325
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:17,626
And the frames are very nice.

326
00:22:17,918 --> 00:22:22,047
We were never close when she was young.

327
00:22:22,214 --> 00:22:23,674
Excuse me.

328
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,553
The toilet is clogged again.

329
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:32,724
- I unclogged it last night. - I unclogged it this morning.

330
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:35,686
Then use the plunger.

331
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:37,604
I can't do that.

332
00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:40,732
I use my hands for creation.

333
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:46,905
I have nightmares that my hands are amputated.

334
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:53,912
I wake up and...

335
00:22:55,497 --> 00:22:57,165
...they've gone numb.

336
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,669
It's terrifying.

337
00:23:12,055 --> 00:23:16,393
You're my only friend, my only friend, my only friend.

338
00:23:17,227 --> 00:23:22,065
You're my only friend, my only friend, my only friend.

339
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:28,196
You're my only friend, my only friend, my only friend

340
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:38,498
Hey Leonard.

341
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,000
Do you know of any photo studios?

342
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:40,751
No.

343
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:45,005
I have a meeting at a gallery and I need help.

344
00:23:45,172 --> 00:23:47,758
- It's in the East Village. - Take the subway.

345
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:49,765
The subway is a pain and it's too far to walk.

346
00:23:49,885 --> 00:23:52,804
Can you assist me?

347
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:59,186
-Fine, but I'm leaving now. -I'll hurry.

348
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:24,753
Will you wait for me?

349
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:29,007
-I have to be at work. -It won't take long.

350
00:24:29,216 --> 00:24:32,469
- I'm leaving in ten minutes. - Of course. Very nice of you.

351
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:49,361
I didn't go to business school.

352
00:24:49,486 --> 00:24:51,571
Oh, look there!

353
00:24:51,822 --> 00:24:55,617
A clown. It reminds me of childhood.

354
00:24:56,368 --> 00:24:59,079
-Let's get closer. -I don't care. Let's go.

355
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:02,708
-Come on. -I don't like clowns.

356
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:05,210
-Stop! -Hey. Over here!

357
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:07,671
She's coming.

358
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:11,008
-She loves clowns. -Stop it. I don't.

359
00:25:11,883 --> 00:25:14,094
But look...

360
00:25:14,386 --> 00:25:15,470
She likes you.

361
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:47,377
-Hello? -You arrived safely?

362
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:52,299
My plane got hijacked. I'm being held hostage.

363
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:54,301
Are you serious?

364
00:25:54,468 --> 00:25:55,969
Has my dad arrived?

365
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,098
He arrived last night.

366
00:26:00,766 --> 00:26:01,767
How is he?

367
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:07,606
He brought some strange guy home.

368
00:26:07,773 --> 00:26:09,024
Okay.

369
00:26:09,357 --> 00:26:13,820
You don't find that odd?

370
00:26:14,154 --> 00:26:17,866
Who cares? You have one-night stands.

371
00:26:18,283 --> 00:26:19,076
Remember?

372
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:22,245
He can do what he wants.

373
00:26:23,747 --> 00:26:28,376
You two can compare your conquests.

374
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:31,379
I haven't fucked anyone since we broke up.

375
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:35,258
It's my apartment. If you don't like it, leave!

376
00:26:35,383 --> 00:26:38,804
Okay, big guy! Big kiss! Bye now!

377
00:28:36,296 --> 00:28:38,381
Hey. Leonard, wake up.

378
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:42,093
-How did it go? -Superb. He loved it.

379
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,137
Now let's grab a drink.

380
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:45,805
I have to work.

381
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:47,599
We'll find a bar close to work.

382
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:50,977
-I can't. -One drink. Don't be a pussy.

383
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:52,687
I'll take a cab home.

384
00:28:52,812 --> 00:28:55,440
It will relax us both.

385
00:28:56,024 --> 00:28:59,736
We can get to know each other.

386
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:10,372
These photos are good, right?

387
00:29:12,874 --> 00:29:13,917
They're okay.

388
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:16,753
They're better than okay.

389
00:29:17,295 --> 00:29:20,048
You have to study a photo to really see it.

390
00:29:20,173 --> 00:29:22,842
You have to search for meaning.

391
00:29:22,968 --> 00:29:25,553
I really don't care.

392
00:29:25,762 --> 00:29:31,851
You don't make art so you can't appreciate it.

393
00:29:31,935 --> 00:29:33,019
I'm not in the mood.

394
00:29:33,103 --> 00:29:34,813
I can see you're unhappy.

395
00:29:35,272 --> 00:29:37,023
It's obvious.

396
00:29:38,316 --> 00:29:40,026
Marie's not happy either.

397
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:45,490
You made each other unhappy.

398
00:29:45,657 --> 00:29:47,325
We were good together.

399
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,370
If so, why did you cheat?

400
00:29:51,663 --> 00:29:52,998
It was just once.

401
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,376
I've had problems with monogamy too.

402
00:29:56,501 --> 00:30:00,547
People should fuck who they want, when they want.

403
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:02,048
We are the same.

404
00:30:02,716 --> 00:30:04,384
-I'm not drinking to that. -Come on.

405
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:07,762
You like to fuck. I like to fuck.

406
00:30:07,846 --> 00:30:10,181
Let's drink to the fuckers who fuck!

407
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:14,019
Regardless, please don't bring any more strangers home.

408
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:17,397
Would you rather I brought women instead of men?

409
00:30:17,522 --> 00:30:20,692
Just stop. It's weird.

410
00:30:20,942 --> 00:30:22,152
Enough already.

411
00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:26,656
You've never fucked a man?

412
00:30:27,782 --> 00:30:29,784
-No. -You're not curious?

413
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:30,744
- No.

414
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:34,372
You're about to turn forty. You're unmarried.

415
00:30:34,581 --> 00:30:35,999
That's suspicious.

416
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,462
-And you. What are you? -What do you mean?

417
00:30:40,545 --> 00:30:44,341
-Are you gay? Straight? Bi? -I'm gay.

418
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:47,218
Roger didn't seem gay.

419
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:51,056
He doesn't act like a queen so he can't be gay?

420
00:30:51,264 --> 00:30:55,101
Well, explain how you fathered Marie?

421
00:30:55,352 --> 00:30:58,396
Sometimes, gay men sleep with women.

422
00:30:58,563 --> 00:31:03,026
I met Marie's mother, I took her photo. We had sex.

423
00:31:03,276 --> 00:31:07,155
One year later, she told me she had a child.

424
00:31:09,699 --> 00:31:12,369
-Marie used to write songs. -I know.

425
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:17,874
She could have had a great career.

426
00:31:18,124 --> 00:31:23,254
She decided to work for a large corporation instead.

427
00:31:23,421 --> 00:31:24,964
She ruined her life.

428
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,884
How can you say this behind her back?

429
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:31,429
I'll say it to her face.

430
00:31:31,554 --> 00:31:37,685
She wrote one song that was so beautiful.

431
00:31:44,526 --> 00:31:45,693
That's not how it goes.

432
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:48,655
Stop it. That sounds awful.

433
00:31:49,572 --> 00:31:51,866
You're making my ear drums bleed.

434
00:31:52,742 --> 00:31:54,119
You're the worst!

435
00:31:56,996 --> 00:31:58,331
No, that's not it.

436
00:31:58,373 --> 00:32:02,043
Your singing is as bad as your French.

437
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:04,379
No. I speak French very well.

438
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:09,926
-Your French sucks. -Sucks?

439
00:32:10,218 --> 00:32:13,346
When I ate your fish I almost vomited.

440
00:32:13,471 --> 00:32:16,307
You should be exiled from every kitchen in New York.

441
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,101
-My kitchen is great. -You're deluded!

442
00:32:18,226 --> 00:32:20,603
Your food tastes like a dead pig's cunt!

443
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,898
Well, your photos are a joke!

444
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:25,984
They're absolutely shit!

445
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:39,205
Leonard. Where have you been?

446
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,624
- What are you doing here? - You don't return my texts.

447
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:44,586
- I'm not a piece of meat. - Why are you so mad?

448
00:32:44,794 --> 00:32:45,837
You're acting crazy.

449
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:49,424
You think I let anyone fuck me?

450
00:32:49,632 --> 00:32:52,469
-It was a mistake, okay? -A mistake?

451
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:55,972
You've got some nerve. I'm nobody's

452
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:58,558
You have to stop.

453
00:32:58,766 --> 00:33:00,643
-Fuck me. -Stop.

454
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:04,105
I knew it. You're a faggot.

455
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:05,440
Listen.

456
00:33:05,565 --> 00:33:08,526
Stop. Look at me.

457
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:10,611
It was a mistake, okay?

458
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:13,490
It meant nothing. It's finished.

459
00:33:13,656 --> 00:33:16,034
Now move on.

460
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:23,208
Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape!

461
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:04,958
How is it going, Leonard?

462
00:34:05,124 --> 00:34:05,750
Hello.

463
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:07,335
Yes.

464
00:34:10,213 --> 00:34:11,047
It's done.

465
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:11,881
Thank you.

466
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:46,410
Something's wrong with Andy!

467
00:36:46,452 --> 00:36:48,329
John, I need help!

468
00:36:48,538 --> 00:36:54,210
-Andy's having a seizure! -What?

469
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,930
What the hell is wrong with you?

470
00:37:06,055 --> 00:37:09,976
- Have you gone nuts? - We have customers waiting.

471
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:50,683
Hey man. Any spare change tonight?

472
00:37:51,517 --> 00:37:55,104
I'm trying to get to Brooklyn.

473
00:37:55,313 --> 00:38:00,568
Is it a bad time? I need a train ticket.

474
00:38:07,116 --> 00:38:11,913
I just need a couch to rest on for a few days.

475
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:16,334
After that, I'm done with this city.

476
00:38:21,214 --> 00:38:27,428
-Did you fuck her? -No. I swear.

477
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:31,807
-Did you? -I'm telling the truth.

478
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:36,521
Stop! I don't like this!

479
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:41,067
-Listen to me! -Stop! Please!

480
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,572
You have to stop!

481
00:38:47,073 --> 00:38:48,991
Calm down!

482
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:04,215
Why did you do it?

483
00:39:04,382 --> 00:39:07,593
I don't know. It was stupid!

484
00:39:07,635 --> 00:39:12,765
Just tell me why.

485
00:39:12,932 --> 00:39:17,103
Okay. William. Smile.

486
00:39:17,228 --> 00:39:18,938
You're like a cherub.

487
00:39:20,022 --> 00:39:21,983
-Hi Leonard. -What's this?

488
00:39:22,108 --> 00:39:25,903
I'm working on some new photos.

489
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,283
But the toilet is clogged again and the fridge is fucked.

490
00:39:30,408 --> 00:39:32,368
It's difficult working under these conditions.

491
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:34,579
This is madness!

492
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:42,378
You're paying me.

493
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,212
Go ahead.

494
00:39:50,595 --> 00:39:53,681
This gets you off - taking photos of dicks?

495
00:39:54,682 --> 00:39:58,144
It takes more than this to get me off.

496
00:39:59,353 --> 00:40:02,148
You know, if you need more models...

497
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:05,109
...I have lots of friends.

498
00:40:27,965 --> 00:40:29,508
-Good evening. -Good evening.

499
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:30,801
I'm a friend of Tuey's.

500
00:40:30,885 --> 00:40:33,471
She said you might be able to host me.

501
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,014
How do you know Tuey?

502
00:40:35,306 --> 00:40:36,682
We work together.

503
00:40:36,891 --> 00:40:38,559
Okay. Please come in.

504
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:39,769
Thank you.

505
00:40:40,269 --> 00:40:42,521
-Take off your shoes. -Of course.

506
00:41:04,502 --> 00:41:07,129
I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble.

507
00:41:07,254 --> 00:41:08,047
Thank you.

508
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,049
Anne, here's your tea.

509
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:16,430
A lot of people need help right now.

510
00:41:17,264 --> 00:41:19,517
Isn't that always the case?

511
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:23,521
Yes, but strange things are happening.

512
00:41:23,604 --> 00:41:25,314
It's like there a virus in the air.

513
00:41:25,356 --> 00:41:26,023
A virus?

514
00:41:27,483 --> 00:41:29,610
It's hard to explain but

515
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:32,738
something's wrong. I can feel it.

516
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:36,575
- Yes, I feel it too. - So you know what I mean?

517
00:41:36,784 --> 00:41:39,870
-I've been hallucinating. -Yeah, me too.

518
00:41:39,954 --> 00:41:44,083
Yesterday, I noticed a large beast sitting in a cafe.

519
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:47,127
He was grotesque and he was shoveling

520
00:41:47,169 --> 00:41:49,463
large snakes into his mouth.

521
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:51,799
I almost screamed.

522
00:41:51,924 --> 00:41:53,842
Then I realized it was only

523
00:41:53,884 --> 00:41:56,262
Gerard Depardieu eating spaghetti.

524
00:41:56,387 --> 00:41:59,473
I'm seeing strange things too.

525
00:41:59,557 --> 00:42:01,225
Maybe we've all losing our minds.

526
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:03,644
It's because of the theta waves.

527
00:42:03,769 --> 00:42:05,646
-What? -Theta waves.

528
00:42:05,771 --> 00:42:08,399
Well, no one knows the side effects.

529
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:11,527
- What are theta waves? - You haven't seen the boxes?

530
00:42:11,652 --> 00:42:15,197
- They're all over town. - They emit a signal.

531
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:18,242
-What signal? -Theta waves.

532
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:21,662
They say it's for high-speed internet.

533
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:24,206
You can download movies faster, make

534
00:42:24,248 --> 00:42:26,709
video calls in super high definition.

535
00:42:26,834 --> 00:42:28,252
But at lightning speeds.

536
00:42:28,419 --> 00:42:31,881
The government hasn't released any information about this.

537
00:42:31,964 --> 00:42:36,469
These theta boxes just mysteriously appeared overnight.

538
00:42:36,552 --> 00:42:38,220
I'm so unaware of this.

539
00:42:38,345 --> 00:42:40,139
The media is ignoring this.

540
00:42:40,181 --> 00:42:43,100
Theta waves will destroy humanity as we know it.

541
00:42:44,268 --> 00:42:46,145
You and your conspiracy theories.

542
00:42:46,228 --> 00:42:50,441
No one has studied this technology.

543
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,568
She believes in the Illuminati.

544
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,444
It's real.

545
00:42:53,486 --> 00:42:55,321
You also think Tupac is still alive.

546
00:42:55,404 --> 00:42:56,155
He is!

547
00:42:56,197 --> 00:42:58,574
That's enough! I'm sick of this shit!

548
00:43:05,498 --> 00:43:06,165
Leonard.

549
00:43:07,124 --> 00:43:07,750
Yes?

550
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:11,003
Tell us your story.

551
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,048
My story?

552
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:19,136
We're here because we need help. We all have a story.

553
00:43:19,303 --> 00:43:21,180
I don't really have a story.

554
00:43:22,223 --> 00:43:25,684
My sister hit me with a brick.

555
00:43:25,726 --> 00:43:27,394
That's horrible.

556
00:43:27,978 --> 00:43:31,690
We were renovating the house.

557
00:43:31,857 --> 00:43:35,319
My sister got angry and threw a brick at me.

558
00:43:35,444 --> 00:43:37,404
Did you finish the renovation?

559
00:43:37,696 --> 00:43:40,866
We were one brick short.

560
00:43:43,035 --> 00:43:45,704
Someone threw acid in my face.

561
00:43:45,955 --> 00:43:48,165
Now tell us your story.

562
00:43:48,332 --> 00:43:51,252
That's enough, Betty. He doesn't want to talk.

563
00:43:51,335 --> 00:43:52,711
It's okay.

564
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:57,758
I don't really have a story.

565
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,177
I just made a mistake.

566
00:44:00,678 --> 00:44:02,847
A mistake that cost me everything.

567
00:44:04,682 --> 00:44:06,350
We all make mistakes.

568
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:11,814
I'd rather not talk about it.

569
00:44:11,897 --> 00:44:13,774
I'm tired and I want to go to bed.

570
00:44:13,941 --> 00:44:16,026
Of course. I understand.

571
00:44:17,027 --> 00:44:19,279
Unfortunately, all my rooms are occupied.

572
00:44:19,321 --> 00:44:20,698
You'll sleep on the couch.

573
00:44:21,115 --> 00:44:22,658
The couch?

574
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:33,479
Who was that?

575
00:45:33,604 --> 00:45:34,688
It's not important.

576
00:45:34,813 --> 00:45:36,982
Spread your asshole.

577
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:39,026
I hope you're not embarrassed.

578
00:45:39,068 --> 00:45:41,195
I'm from Quebec. I have no shame.

579
00:45:45,324 --> 00:45:47,243
-What's your name again? -Louis.

580
00:45:47,409 --> 00:45:49,453
Louis, come over here.

581
00:45:49,495 --> 00:45:51,080
Blondie... Hey Blondie!

582
00:45:51,205 --> 00:45:53,958
Blondie, what's your name again? Hey Blondie.

583
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:56,293
This is the third time.

584
00:45:56,418 --> 00:45:59,296
Stand next to each other.

585
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,633
Now put your hand on his dick.

586
00:46:02,758 --> 00:46:05,177
No, I don't do things like that.

587
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:06,178
It's okay.

588
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:08,681
This guy used to be famous.

589
00:46:08,764 --> 00:46:10,266
Hold on buddy.

590
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:13,394
You talk like I'm a has-been.

591
00:46:13,644 --> 00:46:15,396
I'm still well-known!

592
00:46:15,479 --> 00:46:16,772
I don't care if you're Spencer

593
00:46:16,814 --> 00:46:18,274
Tunick, no one's touching my dick.

594
00:46:18,357 --> 00:46:22,361
Don't worry, pretty boy. You're safe here.

595
00:46:22,444 --> 00:46:26,115
I'll spread my asshole but nothing more.

596
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,244
-You're not gay? -What does that matter?

597
00:46:46,593 --> 00:46:50,180
The party's over. Everyone out!

598
00:46:50,306 --> 00:46:53,100
Did you hear me? It's over!

599
00:46:53,225 --> 00:46:55,560
- I want everyone out! - You're blocking my shot.

600
00:46:55,602 --> 00:46:57,312
Get dressed and get out!

601
00:46:57,354 --> 00:46:59,523
-You're angry. Relax. -Angry?

602
00:46:59,606 --> 00:47:04,611
It's like a Turkish bathhouse in here.

603
00:47:06,071 --> 00:47:07,614
And who is this?

604
00:47:07,698 --> 00:47:09,950
That's where I sleep.

605
00:47:10,075 --> 00:47:11,660
-Get up! -I'm reading about Bitcoin.

606
00:47:11,785 --> 00:47:13,287
-I said, "Get up!" -Don't touch me!

607
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:15,581
Get your dirty ass off my bed!

608
00:47:15,664 --> 00:47:17,874
-Get your hands off me. -Get up!

609
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:20,210
Chill out, man. It's all good.

610
00:47:20,377 --> 00:47:22,796
This guy's getting shit on my couch!

611
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,300
-There's no shit! -I can smell it!

612
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,261
This guy's nuts.

613
00:47:30,346 --> 00:47:31,680
What's this?

614
00:47:31,722 --> 00:47:35,267
This is very Warhol, no?

615
00:47:35,392 --> 00:47:38,145
Smell is linked to memory.

616
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:41,273
One time, I lost my keys.

617
00:47:41,398 --> 00:47:44,068
I couldn't find them anywhere.

618
00:47:44,193 --> 00:47:46,070
And then I farted...

619
00:47:46,195 --> 00:47:52,576
...and I remembered where they were.

620
00:47:52,701 --> 00:47:54,203
Okay, but this is weird.

621
00:47:54,953 --> 00:47:58,374
Get up! You're going to get shit everywhere!

622
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,709
Leonard, smell his dick.

623
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:02,211
Stop taking pictures!

624
00:48:07,341 --> 00:48:10,010
-Dude, are you okay? -My head feels funny.

625
00:48:10,094 --> 00:48:14,390
- It's the theta waves. - I've heard about that.

626
00:48:14,515 --> 00:48:17,393
- They're everywhere. - My head feels clogged too.

627
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:19,353
Sinus infection?

628
00:48:21,063 --> 00:48:24,608
Please leave. I'm begging you.

629
00:48:24,733 --> 00:48:27,569
Take a deep breath.

630
00:48:28,862 --> 00:48:30,781
Now exhale.

631
00:48:30,864 --> 00:48:33,450
Breathe in.

632
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:35,452
Breathe out.

633
00:48:44,586 --> 00:48:49,091
I wonder if this is what it's like for Liberace in Heaven.

634
00:48:58,475 --> 00:49:00,936
Now this? What a pussy.

635
00:49:01,061 --> 00:49:02,604
A man shouldn't cry like that.

636
00:49:02,729 --> 00:49:05,983
It's good to express your emotions.

637
00:49:06,108 --> 00:49:08,861
-I can't watch this. -Where are you going?

638
00:49:08,944 --> 00:49:11,947
I need some fresh air.

639
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:14,450
Can I go too?

640
00:49:14,533 --> 00:49:15,951
Go ahead.

641
00:49:20,122 --> 00:49:24,334
-Where are you going? -To the restroom.

642
00:49:24,418 --> 00:49:28,297
- Where am I supposed to piss? - In the shower.

643
00:49:28,672 --> 00:49:32,759
You should fix the toilet. Everyone is eating cheese.

644
00:49:32,968 --> 00:49:36,722
-Can I ask you a question? -Sure.

645
00:49:36,889 --> 00:49:40,851
Why are you here? This isn't your kind of thing.

646
00:49:41,226 --> 00:49:43,395
Let me explain.

647
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,273
I like to watch golf.

648
00:49:46,523 --> 00:49:49,359
I watch it all the time. I love Tiger Woods.

649
00:49:49,776 --> 00:49:51,487
And your point?

650
00:49:51,737 --> 00:49:53,530
I don't play golf.

651
00:49:55,491 --> 00:49:57,159
Why are you taking photos of his face?

652
00:49:57,284 --> 00:49:58,785
I'm searching.

653
00:50:00,078 --> 00:50:02,873
I cried like that when I saw Amour.

654
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:05,834
Leonard, look at me.

655
00:50:05,918 --> 00:50:06,543
What?

656
00:50:06,585 --> 00:50:10,214
My daughter... is done with you.

657
00:50:10,589 --> 00:50:12,466
It's over.

658
00:50:21,475 --> 00:50:24,645
I'm leaving. My car has surgery tomorrow.

659
00:50:24,811 --> 00:50:26,355
What kind of surgery?

660
00:50:26,563 --> 00:50:28,774
Castration.

661
00:50:28,899 --> 00:50:31,902
Oh, poor guy. What's his name?

662
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:33,904
Marine Le Pen.

663
00:50:34,029 --> 00:50:35,656
I'm leaving too.

664
00:50:35,739 --> 00:50:37,741
No one is going anywhere!

665
00:50:37,866 --> 00:50:40,369
Look at this guy. He wants us out.

666
00:50:40,536 --> 00:50:44,998
Are we supposed to just sit here and watch him cry?

667
00:50:46,959 --> 00:50:49,670
Dance! Let's dance! Voila.

668
00:50:49,836 --> 00:50:52,422
Here we go. Everyone dance!

669
00:50:52,548 --> 00:50:55,133
- What about Marine Le Pen? - Fuck Marine Le Pen.

670
00:50:55,259 --> 00:50:57,511
It's better to dance. Go ahead, dance.

671
00:50:58,011 --> 00:51:00,222
Hey queens. Time to dance!

672
00:51:00,347 --> 00:51:03,934
Come on. Everyone dance now.

673
00:51:21,118 --> 00:51:24,955
-I really loved her. -I know.

674
00:51:25,205 --> 00:51:26,707
Can I have another beer?

675
00:51:26,957 --> 00:51:29,209
In the fridge.

676
00:51:29,459 --> 00:51:31,712
I'm worthless. My food is shit.

677
00:51:31,837 --> 00:51:32,838
I'm worthless!

678
00:51:33,046 --> 00:51:34,840
That's not true.

679
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:36,633
He's right. He's worthless.

680
00:51:36,758 --> 00:51:39,595
-The beer is warm. -The fridge is broken.

681
00:51:39,761 --> 00:51:43,640
The fridge. The toilet. This guy. It's all falling apart.

682
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:45,600
-You need a tissue? -Yes.

683
00:51:45,642 --> 00:51:46,768
He needs a tissue!

684
00:51:46,893 --> 00:51:49,730
-What's your name again? - Bernard!

685
00:51:49,855 --> 00:51:51,648
- Bernard, grab a tissue from the bathroom.

686
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:53,108
It's disgusting up there.

687
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,568
You.

688
00:51:54,693 --> 00:51:56,820
Tissue. Bathroom. Go.

689
00:51:56,945 --> 00:51:58,405
And dance, boy, dance.

690
00:51:58,488 --> 00:52:00,324
As you wish, sir.

691
00:52:00,449 --> 00:52:02,993
Hey Mr. Morose. You're not dancing.

692
00:52:03,118 --> 00:52:04,411
I don't dance.

693
00:52:04,536 --> 00:52:06,622
You're too cool to dance?

694
00:52:06,705 --> 00:52:10,542
- No, I just choose not to. - Maybe you can't dance.

695
00:52:10,751 --> 00:52:14,838
I've got rhythm, but dancing is a delusional act.

696
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:17,674
What a pretentious thing to say.

697
00:52:17,758 --> 00:52:20,177
People dance to forget their impending doom.

698
00:52:20,302 --> 00:52:24,514
Well, when you die, I'll attend your funeral.

699
00:52:24,723 --> 00:52:25,641
Really? Why?

700
00:52:25,724 --> 00:52:28,310
So, I can dance on your grave.

701
00:52:28,852 --> 00:52:30,604
The bathroom smells like shit.

702
00:52:30,729 --> 00:52:32,397
I threw up everywhere.

703
00:52:32,522 --> 00:52:34,900
I hope you didn't puke in the toilet.

704
00:52:34,983 --> 00:52:36,651
I threw up in the sink.

705
00:52:36,693 --> 00:52:38,320
Now there's vomit in the sink, piss

706
00:52:38,362 --> 00:52:39,946
in the shower and shit in the toilet.

707
00:52:40,113 --> 00:52:42,407
Let's party!!!

708
00:53:09,226 --> 00:53:10,185
Hold on.

709
00:53:11,269 --> 00:53:12,938
Zachary, I need to see.

710
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:18,568
Don't move.

711
00:53:18,694 --> 00:53:20,153
Stay still.

712
00:53:21,613 --> 00:53:23,323
Dance. Go. Leave us be.

713
00:53:23,407 --> 00:53:26,284
-But he needs me. -No. Get up. Go.

714
00:53:26,535 --> 00:53:28,829
I want everyone dancing like the world is ending!

715
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:31,581
Macho man! Dance!

716
00:53:34,209 --> 00:53:35,752
Look at me, Leonard.

717
00:53:35,919 --> 00:53:37,587
Do you remember the man from last night?

718
00:53:37,671 --> 00:53:40,757
He was broken from the loss of his wife.

719
00:53:40,882 --> 00:53:43,051
-Roger. -That's right.

720
00:53:43,176 --> 00:53:45,721
I tried to capture his pain but I failed.

721
00:53:45,804 --> 00:53:46,763
But you...

722
00:53:48,348 --> 00:53:50,600
I've seen this look before.

723
00:53:51,393 --> 00:53:53,186
From my mother.

724
00:53:53,687 --> 00:53:55,439
I came home from school.

725
00:53:56,356 --> 00:53:58,024
I walked into the house.

726
00:53:59,151 --> 00:54:01,486
She was sitting alone.

727
00:54:02,446 --> 00:54:04,322
She was smoking a cigarette.

728
00:54:05,657 --> 00:54:08,201
Something was off. I said, "Good morning. mother."

729
00:54:08,326 --> 00:54:10,871
She looked at me but her eyes were empty.

730
00:54:10,954 --> 00:54:14,499
They were stripped of all humanity. And now...

731
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:16,710
...you have the look.

732
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,378
Zombie.

733
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:21,465
Death.

734
00:54:47,157 --> 00:54:48,575
He's bleeding.

735
00:54:50,952 --> 00:54:52,078
What happened?

736
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,497
Marie stabbed me.

737
00:54:54,164 --> 00:54:56,625
Oh, my sweet Marie.

738
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,752
Maybe she does love you.

739
00:55:13,308 --> 00:55:16,102
-What should we do? -Call for help.

740
00:55:17,312 --> 00:55:18,730
What's the number?

741
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:20,565
Wait!

742
00:55:29,825 --> 00:55:31,117
This is absurd.

743
00:55:31,201 --> 00:55:32,619
-What? -This?

744
00:55:32,911 --> 00:55:33,537
- Why?

745
00:55:33,954 --> 00:55:34,663
- Because.

746
00:55:34,746 --> 00:55:36,748
Put him on the couch?

747
00:55:47,801 --> 00:55:49,594
I need a darkroom.

748
00:55:49,761 --> 00:55:51,555
A darkroom? Impossible.

749
00:55:51,638 --> 00:55:55,892
They've been replaced by pharmacies.

750
00:55:56,017 --> 00:55:58,103
Do pharmacies still develop film?

751
00:55:58,186 --> 00:56:00,730
It's all digital now.

752
00:56:00,814 --> 00:56:04,651
There's a darkroom in Bushwick.

753
00:56:04,818 --> 00:56:07,028
The WIFI here is really fast.

754
00:56:07,153 --> 00:56:08,363
Theta waves!

755
00:56:08,446 --> 00:56:11,241
I must go there. Can anyone drive a motorcycle?

756
00:56:11,324 --> 00:56:12,200
I can.

757
00:56:12,284 --> 00:56:16,580
Great. Let's go. Hurry.

758
00:56:16,705 --> 00:56:19,958
I must get this film developed tonight.

759
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:21,251
But he has a fever.

760
00:56:21,418 --> 00:56:24,337
Will you take care of him? This is more important.

761
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,886
Thank you all for such a lovely evening.

762
00:56:31,761 --> 00:56:33,597
You're all so kind.

763
00:56:35,724 --> 00:56:36,975
And so very handsome.

764
00:56:38,268 --> 00:56:39,477
Thank you.

765
00:56:45,275 --> 00:56:46,943
What a nice guy.

766
00:56:47,027 --> 00:56:49,070
That's rare for an artist.

767
00:57:09,466 --> 00:57:11,760
Asshole. Turn around.

768
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:15,263
Your sauce is shit!

769
00:57:15,347 --> 00:57:18,892
It's like licking puss out of an open wound. Disgusting.

770
00:57:18,975 --> 00:57:20,769
Your food tastes like death.

771
00:57:20,852 --> 00:57:23,771
I almost puked all over my shirt.

772
00:57:23,813 --> 00:57:25,315
So fucking gross.

773
00:57:33,114 --> 00:57:33,740
Rape!

774
00:57:44,668 --> 00:57:46,962
Hey, man.

775
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,296
I guess so.

776
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:50,382
-You feeling better? -Yes.

777
00:57:51,549 --> 00:57:52,968
How is your wound?

778
00:57:56,012 --> 00:57:56,721
The same.

779
00:57:59,724 --> 00:58:03,269
I've never cared for photography.

780
00:58:03,478 --> 00:58:07,107
But I can't stop looking at these.

781
00:58:07,774 --> 00:58:09,985
I'm transfixed.

782
00:58:13,613 --> 00:58:15,615
What does it mean?

783
00:58:15,782 --> 00:58:17,367
It's a message.

784
00:58:17,492 --> 00:58:21,579
We are meat. Nothing more, nothing less.

785
00:58:21,705 --> 00:58:24,374
Like a bucket of KFC.

786
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,419
It's reassuring.

787
00:58:28,003 --> 00:58:30,880
We are soulless.

788
00:58:31,172 --> 00:58:33,383
You even said so last night.

789
00:58:33,758 --> 00:58:35,135
We are worthless.

790
00:58:36,094 --> 00:58:38,179
I said that?

791
00:58:38,471 --> 00:58:39,222
Yeah.

792
00:58:41,182 --> 00:58:43,268
Dennis took these?

793
00:58:44,227 --> 00:58:45,228
Yeah.

794
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,479
Where is he?

795
00:58:47,147 --> 00:58:48,356
I have no idea.

796
00:58:48,898 --> 00:58:50,984
He took his stuff and left this morning.

797
00:58:51,443 --> 00:58:52,902
Seriously?

798
00:58:54,738 --> 00:58:57,073
Thank God, it's over.

799
00:58:58,616 --> 00:59:00,326
He took your motorcycle.

800
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,369
What?

801
00:59:01,411 --> 00:59:04,789
It just keeps getting worse.

802
00:59:04,914 --> 00:59:07,375
Last night was fun.

803
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:13,923
And you seem to be feeling much better than last night.

804
00:59:14,007 --> 00:59:16,175
Stay hydrated. You'll be fine.

805
00:59:16,217 --> 00:59:17,802
I need to go to work.

806
00:59:17,886 --> 00:59:21,306
- Let's have breakfast. - I said I have to work.

807
00:59:35,236 --> 00:59:42,077
The theta box lets you download 4K videos instantly.

808
00:59:42,744 --> 00:59:46,873
Theta waves will give us a brave new world.

809
01:00:19,614 --> 01:00:21,825
Follow me and observe.

810
01:00:23,076 --> 01:00:23,785
Hey, hey!

811
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:24,786
Wake up!

812
01:00:25,203 --> 01:00:25,870
I'm awake.

813
01:00:26,037 --> 01:00:28,081
You're like a zombie. Concentrate.

814
01:00:28,164 --> 01:00:30,500
-I'm focused. -Okay then. Let's go.

815
01:00:31,918 --> 01:00:32,961
-Ladies. -Good morning.

816
01:00:33,044 --> 01:00:35,839
Today we have raspberry duck with asparagus.

817
01:00:35,922 --> 01:00:38,842
It's served with mushroom soup or pineapple salad.

818
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,512
I'd like the burger and fries, please.

819
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:43,513
And for you, madame?

820
01:00:43,596 --> 01:00:45,098
The lemon chicken pasta.

821
01:00:45,181 --> 01:00:46,683
-Don't order that. -Why not?

822
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:48,267
It's supposed to be awful.

823
01:00:48,309 --> 01:00:49,435
You've had it?

824
01:00:49,477 --> 01:00:51,688
My friend ordered it.

825
01:00:51,771 --> 01:00:53,857
He said it was so gross, he vomited.

826
01:00:54,232 --> 01:00:56,651
We fired that cook.

827
01:00:56,734 --> 01:00:58,486
First your server number.

828
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,196
The menu items appear.

829
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,156
Hamburger and lemon chicken pasta.

830
01:01:02,198 --> 01:01:04,701
Press "#43 pound" for special instructions.

831
01:01:04,784 --> 01:01:07,203
Press 2 for onions. If caramelized, press ♪ twice.

832
01:01:07,245 --> 01:01:10,248
If raw, press ♪ once. Pound for grilled. 13 for mushrooms

833
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:12,876
-You got all that? -Believe so.

834
01:01:14,043 --> 01:01:17,964
Today we have a raspberry duck with broccoli.

835
01:01:18,047 --> 01:01:20,717
- Asparagus, not broccoli. - My mistake, asparagus.

836
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,719
The meal comes with...

837
01:01:22,886 --> 01:01:26,639
-Mushroom soup. -Mushroom soup and...

838
01:01:26,723 --> 01:01:28,516
-A green salad. -A pineapple salad.

839
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,560
I meant pineapple salad.

840
01:01:29,642 --> 01:01:31,895
- It's one or the other. - It's one or the other.

841
01:01:32,687 --> 01:01:34,272
He's new.

842
01:01:34,355 --> 01:01:36,316
Leonard, I want you to meet someone.

843
01:01:36,399 --> 01:01:38,276
This is Paula, the new line cook.

844
01:01:38,401 --> 01:01:39,444
Good morning.

845
01:01:41,196 --> 01:01:42,488
What the fuck are you doing?

846
01:01:43,323 --> 01:01:45,200
Wake up. We're in the weeds.

847
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:46,576
Move your ass.

848
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,496
You must go faster, numb nuts.

849
01:01:50,622 --> 01:01:51,873
You're like a quadriplegic.

850
01:01:51,915 --> 01:01:53,708
Soup for the lady.

851
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:55,960
And for the gentleman.

852
01:01:57,212 --> 01:01:58,379
Excuse me, sir.

853
01:01:58,630 --> 01:01:59,964
I didn't order this.

854
01:02:00,089 --> 01:02:01,799
Are you sure?

855
01:02:01,966 --> 01:02:02,967
I ordered a steak.

856
01:02:03,134 --> 01:02:05,595
They wanted sauce on the side.

857
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:07,013
It's not on the ticket.

858
01:02:07,055 --> 01:02:08,932
It should be. Look at it.

859
01:02:09,015 --> 01:02:10,934
Look. I pressed "pound 45"

860
01:02:11,309 --> 01:02:13,269
You did it wrong.

861
01:02:13,436 --> 01:02:14,562
I did. "Pound 45"

862
01:02:14,604 --> 01:02:16,898
You must press it at the same time.

863
01:02:17,065 --> 01:02:19,025
-You didn't say that. -I did!

864
01:02:21,361 --> 01:02:22,779
Your salad.

865
01:02:23,613 --> 01:02:25,073
Steak for you.

866
01:02:25,156 --> 01:02:27,325
-I need another whiskey. -Coming.

867
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:29,577
You still haven't brought our bread.

868
01:02:29,702 --> 01:02:31,120
And where's my sauce?

869
01:02:31,246 --> 01:02:32,455
Faster, fuckhead. Faster!

870
01:02:32,538 --> 01:02:35,458
It's like teaching calculus to a cadaver.

871
01:02:36,459 --> 01:02:38,169
-Where is this going? -Table 3.

872
01:02:39,921 --> 01:02:42,006
-This is for table 2. -I was told table 3.

873
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:43,132
It's table 2.

874
01:02:43,299 --> 01:02:46,135
-Where is table 2? -Next to table 3.

875
01:02:46,803 --> 01:02:48,930
My sauce, sir. Where's my sauce?

876
01:02:49,222 --> 01:02:50,056
You don't have sauce?

877
01:02:50,098 --> 01:02:51,557
I need sauce and a steak knife.

878
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,434
This is a butter knife.

879
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:55,270
I don't mean to demoralize you...

880
01:02:55,395 --> 01:02:57,355
But it's like you've had a lobotomy.

881
01:02:57,438 --> 01:03:00,191
My grandma could go faster and she has dementia.

882
01:03:00,275 --> 01:03:00,942
Damn it!

883
01:03:02,652 --> 01:03:05,405
Excuse me. We need more water.

884
01:03:05,488 --> 01:03:07,448
And where's my fucking soup?

885
01:03:07,532 --> 01:03:09,575
We don't have all day, shithead.

886
01:03:09,784 --> 01:03:12,537
This is disgusting! I can't eat this!

887
01:03:12,912 --> 01:03:15,331
You've won an Oscar for the "worst waiter!"

888
01:03:15,415 --> 01:03:16,708
Get a new job!

889
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:18,376
You're the fucking worst!

890
01:03:18,584 --> 01:03:20,211
You're ruining everything!

891
01:03:20,378 --> 01:03:21,963
Middle-aged moron!

892
01:03:22,046 --> 01:03:23,464
You should kill yourself!

893
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:24,924
You're an incompetent fool.

894
01:03:25,008 --> 01:03:26,592
Your life is over!

895
01:03:26,634 --> 01:03:27,760
You don't exist!

896
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:31,139
Your sauce is shit.

897
01:03:50,742 --> 01:03:52,452
Great job, Leonard!

898
01:03:52,535 --> 01:03:53,703
Standing ovation!

899
01:04:52,762 --> 01:04:54,305
Stop! Stop! No, no!

900
01:05:40,101 --> 01:05:41,978
Hello, my friend.

901
01:05:42,478 --> 01:05:44,772
Do you have any change? I'm heading to Brooklyn.

902
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:10,233
Surprise!

903
01:07:17,865 --> 01:07:19,492
Yea, happy birthday!

904
01:07:23,913 --> 01:07:27,959
Happy birthday!

905
01:07:28,334 --> 01:07:32,797
Happy birthday!

906
01:07:33,005 --> 01:07:37,093
Happy birthday!

907
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:41,389
Happy birthday!

908
01:07:41,556 --> 01:07:45,685
Happy birthday!

909
01:07:45,851 --> 01:07:49,981
Happy birthday!

910
01:07:50,398 --> 01:07:54,902
Happy birthday!

911
01:08:27,893 --> 01:08:31,188
Friends! Photo!

912
01:09:28,871 --> 01:09:30,373
Make a wish!

913
01:11:34,747 --> 01:11:37,583
I want to freeze this moment.

914
01:11:38,417 --> 01:11:40,377
I never want it to end.

915
01:11:50,721 --> 01:11:51,889
Do it then.

916
01:11:53,682 --> 01:11:55,226
Do what?

917
01:11:55,643 --> 01:11:57,269
Take a picture.

918
01:12:47,945 --> 01:12:50,573
Marie? Where are you?

919
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:58,539
Where are you hiding? Come out now.

920
01:12:58,873 --> 01:13:00,416
This isn't funny.

921
01:13:00,499 --> 01:13:02,668
Stop fucking around. Marie.

922
01:13:02,793 --> 01:13:04,461
Marie, stop this!

923
01:13:23,147 --> 01:13:24,815
Hey! Get off my bike!

924
01:13:29,361 --> 01:13:32,239
Hey! Come back!

925
01:13:36,243 --> 01:13:39,079
This isn't happening.

926
01:14:19,536 --> 01:14:20,871
Yes?

927
01:14:21,997 --> 01:14:23,123
Roger?

928
01:14:23,207 --> 01:14:25,626
-Who are you? -What are you doing here?

929
01:14:25,709 --> 01:14:27,169
I live here.

930
01:14:27,294 --> 01:14:28,879
But this is my home.

931
01:14:30,506 --> 01:14:33,050
-You're confused. -This is my place.

932
01:14:33,133 --> 01:14:34,259
Hold on now.

933
01:14:34,718 --> 01:14:36,887
-Who are you? -This is absurd. I'm Leonard.

934
01:14:37,054 --> 01:14:38,722
Stop fucking with me.

935
01:14:38,847 --> 01:14:41,225
-Get out of my way. -What's wrong with you?

936
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:44,561
-Let me in. -I'll call the cops.

937
01:14:44,728 --> 01:14:45,854
Fuck this!

938
01:17:31,645 --> 01:17:33,730
Thank you so much. So kind of you.

939
01:17:33,856 --> 01:17:38,318
Good evening. Thanks again.

940
01:17:38,402 --> 01:17:41,905
Thanks for coming. Have a lovely evening.

941
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:43,657
The next show will be bigger.

942
01:18:30,579 --> 01:18:31,872
Dennis?

943
01:18:32,831 --> 01:18:33,498
Dennis.

944
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:36,460
Someone is in our house.

945
01:18:37,085 --> 01:18:38,128
Excuse me?

946
01:18:38,503 --> 01:18:40,464
There's someone in our house.

947
01:18:41,924 --> 01:18:43,675
I don't understand. Do I know you?

948
01:18:43,759 --> 01:18:46,678
- There's someone at Marie's. - Do you know Marie?

949
01:18:46,762 --> 01:18:47,804
But of course.

950
01:18:47,846 --> 01:18:50,724
I am her boyfriend. We live together.

951
01:18:50,807 --> 01:18:53,060
- You're making no sense. - What is he saying?

952
01:18:53,185 --> 01:18:55,729
He says he's Marie's boyfriend.

953
01:18:55,812 --> 01:18:58,732
-You don't recognize me? -No.

954
01:18:58,857 --> 01:19:02,152
You were at my apartment. Naked as the day you were born.

955
01:19:02,277 --> 01:19:04,363
I'm never that naked.

956
01:19:04,446 --> 01:19:07,366
This one got shit on my couch.

957
01:19:07,491 --> 01:19:09,159
And you...

958
01:19:09,243 --> 01:19:11,495
You clogged my toilet.

959
01:19:11,787 --> 01:19:14,581
You clogged my toilet!

960
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:19,419
He has shit this big coming out of his intestines.

961
01:19:19,544 --> 01:19:20,671
Enormous shit!

962
01:19:21,588 --> 01:19:23,757
Yeah, baby. Yeah.

963
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,009
-What is he talking about? -I wish I knew.

964
01:19:26,134 --> 01:19:28,262
You see this picture?

965
01:19:28,345 --> 01:19:29,680
I took this myself.

966
01:19:31,848 --> 01:19:34,977
I took this. It's mine!

967
01:19:35,102 --> 01:19:37,104
It belongs to me!

968
01:19:37,187 --> 01:19:39,398
Look. Can't you see?

969
01:19:39,523 --> 01:19:41,984
We are a couple there. We were a couple!

970
01:19:42,067 --> 01:19:44,027
This is me! Can't you see?

971
01:19:44,152 --> 01:19:45,320
What's wrong with you?

972
01:19:45,445 --> 01:19:49,116
Get out of here, you lunatic!

973
01:19:55,247 --> 01:19:57,291
Leave now! Go!

974
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:00,335
Go! Now!

975
01:20:00,419 --> 01:20:03,255
You stole my bike!

976
01:20:03,505 --> 01:20:06,174
Those are my bags!

977
01:20:06,383 --> 01:20:08,552
No! Fuck all of you!

978
01:20:08,635 --> 01:20:10,262
I'm warning you! Go!

979
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:12,806
Hit the road, shithead.

980
01:20:12,973 --> 01:20:13,640
Now!

981
01:20:15,684 --> 01:20:17,394
He's a madman!

982
01:21:59,037 --> 01:22:02,082
You don't look so good.

983
01:22:02,249 --> 01:22:04,501
It's been a shitty day.

984
01:22:04,668 --> 01:22:06,169
It will be okay.

985
01:22:06,628 --> 01:22:08,755
Would you like some soup?

986
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,633
Thank you but I just want to sleep.

987
01:22:11,758 --> 01:22:13,427
Leonard?

988
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:16,221
Oh, Leonard, you've arrived.

989
01:22:16,972 --> 01:22:17,722
Anne.

990
01:22:18,056 --> 01:22:19,766
Anne, Leonard is here.

991
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,519
Leonard? You've come back.

992
01:22:22,769 --> 01:22:24,271
Thank God.

993
01:22:24,354 --> 01:22:26,940
We were terribly worried.

994
01:22:30,152 --> 01:22:32,154
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

995
01:22:32,487 --> 01:22:33,738
We need you here.

996
01:22:33,947 --> 01:22:35,282
You are home now.

997
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:42,956
You are home now.

998
01:22:43,123 --> 01:22:45,167
Stay as long as you like.

999
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:47,335
- What about the rent? - Don't worry about that now.

1000
01:22:47,377 --> 01:22:50,922
When you're back on your feet, you can make a contribution.

1001
01:22:51,214 --> 01:22:52,841
You're all being so kind.

1002
01:22:53,008 --> 01:22:54,926
I don't know what to say.

1003
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:56,511
You don't have to say anything.

1004
01:22:56,553 --> 01:22:58,013
It's our pleasure.

1005
01:22:58,305 --> 01:23:00,307
-Try to get some sleep now. -Okay.

1006
01:23:03,101 --> 01:23:04,561
-One last thing, Leonard. -Yes?

1007
01:23:04,686 --> 01:23:06,813
Someone else is arriving tonight.

1008
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,815
Don't be alarmed if you find him on the coach.

1009
01:23:08,857 --> 01:23:09,900
Okay.

1010
01:23:10,025 --> 01:23:10,817
Good night.

1011
01:23:10,859 --> 01:23:12,569
-Good night. -Good night.

1012
01:23:20,285 --> 01:23:24,039
Why do you want kids? You have a great career.

1013
01:23:24,122 --> 01:23:28,668
Life is not only about work.

1014
01:23:28,919 --> 01:23:31,296
It's about building a family, a life of meaning.

1015
01:23:31,379 --> 01:23:35,383
But we are a family, and we're free.

1016
01:23:35,509 --> 01:23:38,386
We can do whatever we want.

1017
01:23:39,054 --> 01:23:40,347
I bust my ass to make you happy!

1018
01:23:40,472 --> 01:23:42,349
Put down the knife!

1019
01:23:45,852 --> 01:23:51,233
You know I love you, but I'm not mature.

1020
01:23:51,316 --> 01:23:54,027
I feel like a loser.

1021
01:23:56,655 --> 01:23:58,615
Your sauce is shit.

1022
01:24:04,329 --> 01:24:05,580
Marie is dead.

1023
01:24:38,071 --> 01:24:40,657
You're the guy with the motorcycle.

1024
01:24:41,074 --> 01:24:42,450
That's me.

1025
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,539
-You live here? -Just temporarily.

1026
01:24:49,124 --> 01:24:51,042
You are lucky to have a room.

1027
01:24:51,751 --> 01:24:54,296
Excuse me. I have to use the bathroom.

1028
01:24:54,629 --> 01:24:57,591
Go ahead, man. It's your place.

1029
01:25:04,931 --> 01:25:06,516
Does it work?

1030
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:09,477
-What exactly? -The toilet.

1031
01:25:10,604 --> 01:25:13,773
The toilet. Yeah, I just used it.

1032
01:25:13,898 --> 01:25:15,900
It works perfectly.

1033
01:25:18,194 --> 01:25:20,488
It works perfectly.

1034
01:26:00,612 --> 01:26:02,322
What are you watching?

1035
01:26:04,282 --> 01:26:05,992
I'm not sure.

1036
01:26:06,326 --> 01:26:07,869
It's a silent film?

1037
01:26:08,787 --> 01:26:12,499
No. I didn't want to wake anyone.

1038
01:26:12,749 --> 01:26:15,377
So I turned off the sound.

1039
01:26:15,669 --> 01:26:22,676
You can learn so much by studying the pictures.

1040
01:26:23,385 --> 01:26:25,845
The images speak.

1041
01:26:26,513 --> 01:26:28,515
The images speak.

1042
01:26:29,683 --> 01:26:31,685
Have a seat.

1043
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:33,269
I will. Thank you.

1044
01:26:40,193 --> 01:26:41,569
You know...

1045
01:26:41,986 --> 01:26:44,781
It sucks being homeless.

1046
01:26:46,282 --> 01:26:47,951
There's no television.

1047
01:26:49,703 --> 01:26:51,079
Everything sucks.

1048
01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:53,289
Life.

1049
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:56,918
Health.

1050
01:27:00,171 --> 01:27:02,048
How did you become homeless?

1051
01:27:04,676 --> 01:27:06,302
It's a shitty story.

1052
01:27:08,012 --> 01:27:09,973
I had a fight with my mom.

1053
01:27:10,098 --> 01:27:11,683
We hated each other.

1054
01:27:13,017 --> 01:27:14,060
After that...

1055
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:17,981
After that...

1056
01:27:19,691 --> 01:27:21,818
One thing led to another.

1057
01:27:23,278 --> 01:27:26,573
I started taking drugs.

1058
01:27:29,909 --> 01:27:32,620
In a moment, everything changed.

1059
01:27:41,963 --> 01:27:43,590
And you?

1060
01:27:43,965 --> 01:27:45,842
What's your story?

1061
01:27:49,137 --> 01:27:51,431
Today's my birthday.

1062
01:27:53,016 --> 01:27:55,894
Really? Today?

1063
01:27:56,686 --> 01:27:57,979
Yes.

1064
01:28:00,899 --> 01:28:02,192
How old are you?

1065
01:28:02,901 --> 01:28:04,486
Forty.

1066
01:28:07,781 --> 01:28:09,199
Happy birthday.

1067
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:12,869
Thank you.
