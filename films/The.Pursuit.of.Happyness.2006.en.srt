1
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,097
Time to get up, man.

2
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,226
- All right, Dad.
- Come on.

3
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,921
Should be here soon.

4
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,595
- I think I should make a list.
- What do you mean?

5
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,181
- For your birthday gifts?
- Yeah.

6
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,934
You know you're only getting
a couple of things, right?

7
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:50,188
Yeah, I know. Just to look at
and study so I can choose better.

8
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,316
Okay, well, that's smart.
Yeah, make a list.

9
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,736
Can you spell everything
you're thinking of?

10
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,531
- I think so.
- All right. That's good.

11
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,371
- How you doing in here, man?
- Okay.

12
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,590
Can we go to the park today, after?

13
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,844
No, I gotta go to Oakland.
Well, maybe, we'll see.

14
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,637
Give me a kiss.

15
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,390
I'll talk to you later.

16
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,520
Excuse me.

17
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,023
Oh, excuse me...

18
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,484
...when is somebody
gonna clean this off?

19
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,031
And the Y?
The Y. We talked about this.

20
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,659
It's an I in "happiness."
There's no Y in "happiness." It's an I.

21
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,830
<i>I'm Chris Gardner.</i>

22
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,375
<i>I met my father for the first time
when I was 28 years old.</i>

23
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,795
<i>And I made up my mind
as a young kid...</i>

24
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,546
<i>...that when I had children...</i>

25
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,050
<i>...my children were gonna know
who their father was.</i>

26
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,721
<i>This is part of my life story.</i>

27
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,892
<i>This part is called "Riding the Bus."</i>

28
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,025
What's that?

29
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,861
It's a time machine, isn't it?

30
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,239
Seems like a time machine.

31
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,575
That seems like a time machine.
It's a time machine. Take me with you.

32
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,952
<i>This machine...</i>

33
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,662
<i>...this machine on my lap--</i>

34
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,831
This guy, he has a time machine.

35
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,084
He travels in the past
with this machine and...

36
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,545
- <i>-it is not a time machine.</i>

37
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,714
<i>It's a portable
bone-density scanner.</i>

38
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,176
<i>A medical device I sell for a living.</i>

39
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,887
Thank you for the opportunity
to discuss it with you.

40
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,181
- I appreciate it.
- We just don't need it, Chris.

41
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,141
It's unnecessary and expensive.

42
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,477
- Well, maybe next--
- Thank you.

43
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,650
<i>It gave a slightly denser picture
than an x-ray for twice the money.</i>

44
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,280
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

45
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,115
- What happened?
- No, nothing.

46
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,908
Look, I can't get Christopher today.

47
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,619
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.
I'm back on at 7.

48
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,580
I know. I have got to go to Oakland.

49
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,958
So I gotta get Christopher home,
feed him, bathe him...

50
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,752
...get him in bed,
and be back here by 7?

51
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,088
- Yes.
- And we got the tax-bill notice today.

52
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,800
- What are you gonna do about that?
- Look, this is what we gotta do.

53
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:32,309
<i>You see that car? The one
with the pretty yellow shoe on it?</i>

54
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,894
<i>That's mine.</i>

55
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,062
<i>There's no parking near hospitals.</i>

56
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,773
<i>That's what happens
when you're always in a rush.</i>

57
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,859
Thanks anyway. Very much.

58
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,987
- Maybe next quarter.
- It's possible.

59
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:50,410
<i>I needed to sell at least two scanners
a month for rent and daycare.</i>

60
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,662
<i>I'd have to sell one more...</i>

61
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,625
<i>...to pay off all of those tickets
under my windshield wiper.</i>

62
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,425
<i>The problem is...</i>

63
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,845
<i>...I haven't sold any for a while.</i>

64
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,183
Since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese?

65
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,936
Since birth?

66
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,440
- What's that?
- What?

67
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,735
- What is this?
- It's a gift for Christopher.

68
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,446
- From who?
- Cynthia from work.

69
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,741
It's for adults. Chris can't use it.
She didn't know.

70
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,952
What are you supposed
to do with it?

71
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,747
Make every side the same colour.

72
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,334
Did you pay the taxes?

73
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,754
No, I'm gonna
have to file an extension.

74
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:47,717
- You already filed an extension.
- Yeah, well, I gotta file another one.

75
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,763
That's-- It's $650.
I'll have it in the next month.

76
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,099
That means interest, right?

77
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,685
- And a penalty?
- Yeah, a little bit.

78
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:02,524
Look, why don't you let me do this?
All right, just relax. Okay?

79
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,903
- Come here. Calm down.
- I have to go back to work.

80
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,540
Let's get ready for bed.
Hey, put your plate in the sink.

81
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,168
<i>A few days ago I was presented
with a report I'd asked for...</i>

82
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,089
<i>...a comprehensive audit, if you will,
of our economic condition.</i>

83
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,509
<i>You won't like it. I didn't like it.</i>

84
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,386
<i>But we have to face the truth...</i>

85
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,222
<i>...and then go to work
to turn things around.</i>

86
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:38,184
<i>And make no mistake about it,
we can turn them around.</i>

87
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,479
<i>The federal budget is out of control.</i>

88
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,066
<i>And we face runaway deficits
of almost $80 billion...</i>

89
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,695
<i>...for this budget year
that ends September 30th.</i>

90
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:54,117
<i>That deficit is larger than
the entire federal budget in 1957.</i>

91
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,911
<i>And so is the almost $80 billion...</i>

92
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:01,416
<i>...we will pay in interest
this year on the national debt.</i>

93
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,586
<i>Twenty years ago, in 1960...</i>

94
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:08,965
<i>...our federal government payroll
was less than $13 billion.</i>

95
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,843
<i>Today it is 75 billion.</i>

96
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:17,640
<i>During these 20 years, our population
has only increased by 23.3 percent...</i>

97
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,536
Man, I got two questions for you:

98
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,873
What do you do?
And how do you do it?

99
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,503
- I'm a stockbroker.
- Stockbroker. Oh, goodness.

100
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,671
Had to go to college
to be a stockbroker, huh?

101
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,634
You don't have to. Have to be good
with numbers and good with people.

102
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,220
- That's it.
- Hey, you take care.

103
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,514
I'll let you hang on to my car
for the weekend.

104
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,183
- But I need it back for Monday.
- Feed the meter.

105
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,734
<i>I still remember that moment.</i>

106
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:18,701
<i>They all looked
so damn happy to me.</i>

107
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,253
<i>Why couldn't I look like that?</i>

108
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,230
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.

109
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,567
I'm gonna stop by a brokerage firm
after work.

110
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,028
- For what?
- I wanna see about a job there.

111
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,865
Yeah? What job?

112
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,409
You know, when I--

113
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,245
When I was a kid, I could go through
a math book in a week.

114
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,748
So I'm gonna go see about
what job they got down there.

115
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,793
What job?

116
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,506
Stockbroker.

117
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,012
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

118
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,431
Not an astronaut?

119
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,908
Don't talk to me like that, Linda.

120
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:44,829
I'm gonna go down and see about this,
and I'm gonna do it during the day.

121
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,748
You should probably
do your sales calls.

122
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,626
I don't need you to tell me
about my sales calls, Linda.

123
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,046
I got three of them
before the damn office is even open.

124
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,007
Do you remember
that rent is due next week?

125
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,092
Probably not.

126
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,803
We're already two months behind.

127
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,015
Next week we'll owe three months.

128
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:08,645
I've been pulling double shifts
for four months now, Chris.

129
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:13,316
Just sell what's in your contract.
Get us out of that business.

130
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,237
Linda, that is what I am trying to do.

131
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,657
This is what I'm trying to do
for my family...

132
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,242
...for you and for Christopher.

133
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,787
What's the matter with you?

134
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,668
Linda.

135
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,753
Linda.

136
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:05,868
<i>This part of my life
is called "Being Stupid."</i>

137
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,205
Can I ask you a favour, miss?

138
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:13,251
Do you mind if I leave this here
with you just for five minutes?

139
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,962
I have a meeting in there
and I don't wanna carry that...

140
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,214
...looking small time.

141
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:23,469
Here is a dollar and I'll give you
more money when I come back out.

142
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,931
Okay? It's not valuable.
You can't sell it anywhere.

143
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:32,687
I can't even sell it, and it's my job.
All right? Be right back.

144
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,071
- Chris? Tim Brophy, Resources.
- Yes. How are you?

145
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,614
- Follow me.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,576
Let me see if I can find you
an application for our internship.

147
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,038
I'm afraid that's all we can do for you.
See, this is a satellite office.

148
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,915
Jay Twistle in the main office,
he oversees Witter Resources.

149
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,209
I mean, I'm-- You know,
I'm just this office.

150
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,338
As you can see, we got a hell of lot
of applications here, so...

151
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,591
Normally I have a résumé sheet,
but I can't seem to find it anywhere.

152
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,178
- We...
- Thank you very much.

153
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,554
I need to go.

154
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,848
I'll bring this back.

155
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:12,226
- Thank you.
- Okay.

156
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:23,112
<i>Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner.
Why did I do that?</i>

157
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,947
Excuse me. Excuse me.

158
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:30,578
<i>Like I said, this part of my life

Don't move! Stay--!

160
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,805

161
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,183
Don't move!
Stop this--! Stop the train!

162

00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,718
<i>I didn't need that many lines.</i>

167
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,810
Try and sleep. It's late.

168
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:49,365
<i>It's a puzzle measuring just 3 inches
by 3 inches on each side...</i>

169
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,034
<i>...made up of multiple colours
that you twist and turn...</i>

170
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,829
<i>...and try to get
to a solid colour on each side.</i>

171
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,666
<i>This little cube
is the gift sensation of 1981.</i>

172
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,251
<i>Don't expect to solve it easily.</i>

173
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,879
<i>Although we did encounter
one math professor at USF...</i>

174
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,590
<i>...who took just 30 minutes on his.</i>

175
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,050
<i>This is as far as I've gotten
on mine.</i>

176
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,596
<i>As you can see,
I still have a long way to go.</i>

177
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,432
<i>This is Jim Finnerty reporting
for KJSF in Richmond.</i>

178
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,351
Hey, wake up.

179
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,061
Eat.

180
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,648
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, baby.

181
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,860
- Come back without that, please.
- Oh, yeah, I'm going to.

182
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,988
So go ahead, say goodbye to it,
because I'm coming back without it.

183
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,616
Goodbye and good riddance.

184
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,784
You ain't had to add
the "good riddance" part.

185
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,077
Bye, Mom.

186
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,914
Bye.

187
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,751
It's written as P-P-Y, but it's
supposed to be an I in "happiness."

188
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,087
- Is it an adjective?
- No, actually it's a noun.

189
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,006
But it's not spelled right.

190
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,801
- Is "fuck" spelled right?
- Yeah, that's spelled right.

191
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,138
But that's not part of the motto,
so you're not supposed to learn that.

192
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:59,268
That's an adult word to show anger
and other things.

193
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,313
- But just don't use that one, okay?
- Okay.

194
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,690
What's that say
on the back of your bag?

195
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,984
My nickname.

196
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,778
We pick nicknames.

197
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,365
- Oh, yeah? What's it say?
- "Hot Rod."

198
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,411
- Did you have a nickname?
- Yep.

199
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,331
- What?
- "Ten-Gallon Head."

200
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:23,459
- What's that?
- I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas.

201
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:28,297
Everybody wears cowboy hats.
And a ten-gallon's a big hat.

202
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:32,051
I was smart back then,
so they called me Ten-Gallon Head.

203
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,804
- Hoss wears that hat.
- Hoss?

204
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,806
Hoss Cartwright on <i>Bonanza.</i>

205
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,768
- How do you know <i>Bonanza?</i>
- We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.

206
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,522
- You watch <i>Bonanza</i> at daycare?
- Yeah.

207
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,650
When? When do you watch it?

208
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,529
- After snack? After your nap?
- After <i>Love Boat.</i>

209
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,619
I made my list for my birthday.

210
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:03,916
- Yeah, what'd you put on there?
- A basketball or an ant farm.

211
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,799
- He says he's been watching TV.
- Oh, little TV for history.

212
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:15,094
- <i>Love Boat?</i>
- For history. Navy.

213
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,555
That's not the Navy.

214
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,890
I mean, he could
watch television at home.

215
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:24,478
We're paying you $150 a month.
If he's gonna be sitting around...

216
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,064
...watching TV all day,
we're taking him out of here.

217
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:31,068
Go pay more at other daycare
if you don't like Navy TV.

218
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:38,159
You late pay anyway.
You complain. I complain.

219
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,456
Can you at least put the dog upstairs
in your room or something?

220
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,124
Bye.

<i>I was waiting for
Witter Resource head Jay Twistle...</i>

223
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:39,136
<i>...whose name sounded so delightful,
like he'd give me a job and a hug.</i>

224
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:43,349
<i>I just had to show him I was good
with numbers and good with people.</i>

225
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,101
- Morning, Mr. Twistle.
- Good morning.

226
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,727
- Mr. Twistle, Chris Gardner.
- Hi.

227
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,730
I wanted to drop this off personally
and make your acquaintance.

228
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,317
I thought I'd catch you on the way in.
I'd love the opportunity to discuss...

229
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,778
...what may seem like weaknesses
on my application.

230
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,781
We'll start with this, and we'll call you
if we wanna sit down.

231
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,951
- Yes, sir. You have a great day.
- You too.

232
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,584
<i>Hey, yeah, how you doing?</i>

233
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,962
This is Chris Gardner calling
for Dr. Delsey.

234
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,339
Yeah, I'm running a little late
for a sales call.

235
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:19,051
I was wondering if--
Yeah, Osteo National.

236
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,804
Right. We can still--? Half an hour?

237
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,683
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.

238
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,362
Hey! Hey!

239
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,823
Hey!

240
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,408
<i>This part of my life...</i>

241
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,327
- Wait!
- <i>...this part here...</i>

242
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,497
<i>...it's called "Running."</i>

243
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,666
Hey! Hey!

244
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,418
Wait!

245
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:56,172
Hey! Wait!

246
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,716
<i>That was my stolen machine.</i>

247
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,010
<i>Unless she was with
a guy who sold them too.</i>

248
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,763
<i>Which was unlikely...</i>

249
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,640
<i>...because I was the only one
selling them in the Bay Area.</i>

250
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,518
<i>I spent our entire life savings
on these things.</i>

251
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,524
<i>It was such
a revolutionary machine.</i>

252
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,068
- Can you feel it, baby?
- Oh, yeah.

253
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,820
You got me doing all the work.

254
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,531
<i>What I didn't know
is that doctors and hospitals...</i>

255
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,619
<i>...would consider them
unnecessary luxuries.</i>

256
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:32,708
<i>I even asked the landlord
to take a picture.</i>

257
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:38,881
<i>So if I lost one, it was like losing
a month's groceries.</i>

258
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,720
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

259
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,309
Hey, get back here!

260
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,399
Hey, man, I--

261
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,570
- Who's he?
- He's that guy...

262
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,918
- Did you forget?
- Forget what?

263
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,380
You're not supposed
to have any of those.

264
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,800
- Yeah, I know.
- You have two now.

265
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,728
Hey.

266
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,275
Hey, Mom.

267
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:48,492
One, two, three!

268
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,705
- That's a basketball!
- Hey, hey. What do you mean?

269
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,623
You don't know that
that's a basketball.

270
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,752
This could be an ant farm. This could
be a microscope or anything.

271
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,422
- No, it's not.
- There, there.

272
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,925
All right, come on.
Open him up. Open him up.

273
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:15,185
- That paper's a little heavy, huh?
- Yeah, but I got it.

274
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,991
You should've seen me
out there today.

275
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,702
Somebody stole a scanner.
I had to run the old girl down--

276
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,495
Whatever.

277
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,167
- What?
- Whatever, Chris.

278
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,586
What the hell
you got attitude about?

279
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,589
- "Whatever" what?
- Every day's got some damn story.

280
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,174
Hey, Roy. Roy!

281
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,676
Can you beat your little rug
when nobody's out here?

282
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,303
There's dust and shit all over.

283
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,889
- I'm trying to keep a clean house.
- Hey, wait a second.

284
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,850
Look, Linda, relax.

285
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:58,395
We're gonna come out of this.
Everything is gonna be fine, all right?

286
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,400
You said that before,
when I got pregnant. "It'll be fine."

287
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:08,614
- So you don't trust me now?
- Whatever. I don't care.

288
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,048
- Taxi!
- Mr. Twistle.

289
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,884
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi. Chris Gardner.

290
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,928
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

291
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:34,223
I submitted an application for the
intern programme about a month ago...

292
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,642
...and I would just love
to sit with you briefly--

293
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,811
Listen, I'm going
to Noe Valley, Chris.

294
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:42,314
- Take care of yourself.
- Mr. Twistle.

295
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,900
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

296
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,819
How about we share a ride?

297
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,489
- All right, get in.
- All right.

298
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,331
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor...

299
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,376
...who loved to play golf,
hours every day...

300
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:07,214
...and I would actually
perform medical procedures...

301
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,966
...when he'd leave me in the office.

302
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:14,430
So I'm used to being in a position
where I have to make decisions and...

303
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,767
Mr. Twistle, listen.
This is a very important--

304
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,145
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This thing's impossible.

305
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,357
- I can do it.
- No, you can't. No one can.

306
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,235
- That's bullshit.
- No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.

307
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,864
- No, you can't.
- Let me see it.

308
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,657
Give it here.

309
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:40,956
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow,
you really messed it up.

310
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,666
Sorry.

311
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:49,173
It looks like it works around a swivel,
so the centre pieces never move.

312
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:52,468
So if it's yellow in the centre,
that's the yellow side.

313
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,179
If it's red in the centre,
that's the red side.

314
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:59,016
- Okay.
- So... You can slow down.

315
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:02,311
Listen, we can drive around all day.
I don't believe you can do this.

316
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,188
- Yeah, I can.
- No, you can't.

317
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,564
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

318
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,691
I'm telling you, no one can.

319
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,862
See? That's all I ever do.

320
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,044
You almost have this side.

321
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,129
Holy cow.

322
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:43,143
- You almost had that one.
- I'm gonna get it.

323
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:52,444
Look at that.

324
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:16,927
You're almost there.

325
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:44,371
- 17. 10.
- This is me.

326
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,916
Good job.

327
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,838
- Goodbye.
- Yeah. I'll see you soon.

328
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,967
Where are you going, sir?

329
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:00,179
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going, please?

330
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,267
Two-- A couple of blocks.

331
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:08,854
- Just flip around.
- Okay.

332
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,523
Hey! Stop it! Hey!

333
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,484
- Where are you going? Come here!
- No!

334
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,487
- No, no, no!
- You asshole, give me my money!

335
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,030
- Give me my money.
- Please stop.

336
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,241
- Please, please, please!
- Son of a bitch.

337
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,993
Please! He should've paid you!

338
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,745
- Come here!
- I'm sorry.

339
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,664
- I'm so sorry.
- I'll kick your ass!

340
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,292
- I'm sorry!
- Idiot.

341
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,429
I'll get you!

342
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:28,141
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!

343
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,617
Hey!

344
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,704
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

345
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,081
Stop him!

346
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,045
Stop him!

347
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,969
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

348
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:07,014
<i>Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

349
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,066
No! No! No!

350
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,571
No!

351
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,096
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, yeah.

352
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,973
Sorry I couldn't
make it home on time.

353
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:54,436
- <i>Chris, I missed my shift.</i>
- Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that.

354
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,939
Look, I'm on my way right now.
Are you all right with Christopher?

355
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,484
<i>I'm leaving. Chris, I'm leaving.</i>

356
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,694
- What?
- <i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

357
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:07,491
I have my things together,
and I'm taking our son...

358
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,242
...and we're gonna leave now.

359
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,994
<i>I'm gonna put the phone down.</i>

360
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,748
- Linda, wait a minute. Hold it, hold--
- <i>I'm going to leave. We are leaving.</i>

361
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:23,882
<i>It was right then that I started
thinking about Thomas Jefferson...</i>

362
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,636
<i>...the Declaration of Independence...</i>

363
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:33,975
<i>...and the part about our right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</i>

364
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,977
<i>And I remember thinking:</i>

365
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:40,565
<i>How did he know
to put the "pursuit" part in there?</i>

366
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:45,487
<i>That maybe happiness is something
that we can only pursue.</i>

367
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,698
<i>And maybe we can actually
never have it...</i>

368
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,700
<i>...no matter what.</i>

369
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,619
<i>How did he know that?</i>

370
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,669
Linda. Linda.

371
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,287
- Hello?
- <i>Chris.</i>

372
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,123
- Who is this?
- <i>Jay Twistle.</i>

373
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,792
- Hey.
- <i>Dean Witter.</i>

374
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,712
Yeah, of course. How are you?

375
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,381
<i>I'm fine. Listen, do you still
wanna come in and talk?</i>

376
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:47,841
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

377
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,927
<i>I'll tell you what. Come on by
day after tomorrow, in the morning.</i>

378
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,890
<i>We're interviewing for the internships.
You got a pen and paper?</i>

379
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,683
Yes. Yes, I do.

380
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:02,397
- Hold on one second.
- <i>All right.</i>

381
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,403
<i>Hello?</i>

382
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,947
- <i>Chris?</i>
- Go ahead. I have one.

383
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,783
<i>Write this number down so you can
call my secretary, Janice.</i>

384
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,077
- <i>She can give you all the specifics.</i>
- Yep.

385
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,121
- <i>Okay, 415.</i>
- 415.

386
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,040
- <i>864.</i>
- 864.

387
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,250
- <i>0256.</i>
- 0256.

388
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,462
- <i>Yeah, extension 4796.</i>
- 4796.

389
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:29,925
- <i>Right. Call her tomorrow.</i>
- Yes, sir. 415-864-0256.

390
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,426
- <i>Okay, buddy.</i>
- All right, yes.

391
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,803
- Thank you very much.
- <i>We'll see you soon.</i>

392
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,766
864-0256.

393
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:41,144
4796. Janice.

394
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,024
- Chris.
- Hey.

395
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,485
Did you--? Have you seen
Linda and Christopher?

396
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,612
- No. You catch the game last night?
- No, no.

397
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,155
You didn't see that, 118, 1 --?

398
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,574
Excuse me, did Linda
and Christopher come in here?

399
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:58,453
- No, I haven't seen them.
- 119-120. Double overtime.

400
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,789
Moons hits a three-pointer
at 17 seconds left.

401
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,582
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

402
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,918
Can't talk to you
about numbers right now.

403
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,754
- What's your problem with numbers?
- 864-2...

404
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,881
- And you owe me money.
- Yeah.

405
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,841
You owe me $14.

406
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,927
I'm gonna get that to you.

407
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,264
I need my money.
I need my money.

408
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,475
Fourteen's a number.

409
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:50,130
Hey, don't you ever take my son
away from me again.

410
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,631
- You hear me?
- Leave me alone!

411
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,675
Don't take my son away
from me again.

412
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,635
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

413
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:59,139
Don't you walk away from me when
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

414
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,849
- Do you wanna leave?
- Yeah.

415
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,893
- You wanna leave?
- Yes, I want to leave!

416
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,022
Get the hell out of here,
then, Linda.

417
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,733
Get the hell out of here.
Christopher's staying with me.

418
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,235
You're the one that dragged
us down. You hear me?

419
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:15,530
- You are so weak.
- No. I am not happy anymore.

420
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,366
- I'm just not happy!
- Then go get happy, Linda!

421
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,909
Just go get happy.

422
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,329
But Christopher's living with me.

423
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,331
- Stop!
- Did you hear what I said?

424
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,042
Christopher's living with me!

425
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,112
Hey. Come on, let's go.

426
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,657
- How you doing, Mrs. Chu?
- Hi.

427
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,913
- Where's Mom?
- Look, just get your stuff.

428
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,583
But she told me she was
coming to pick me up today.

429
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,794
Yeah, I know.

430
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,591
I talked to Mom earlier.
Everything's fine, okay?

431
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,224
Where do I sleep tonight?

432
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,559
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy?

433
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,437
- Yeah.
- All right. Because I'm happy.

434
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:33,108
And if you're happy and I'm happy,
then that's a good thing, right?

435
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,818
- Yeah.
- All right.

436
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,070
You're sleeping with me.

437
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:41,950
You're staying at home,
where you belong, all right?

438
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,049
Christopher.

439
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,445
Hey, listen. I need the rent.

440
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,071
I can't wait anymore.

441
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,657
Yeah, I'm good for that, Charlie.
I'm gonna get it.

442
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,910
Why don't you go two blocks over
at the Mission Inn motel?

443
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,662
It's half what you pay here.

444
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:31,291
Listen, Chris. I need you out
of here in the morning.

445
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,836
The hell am I supposed
to be out of here tomorrow?

446
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,212
I got painters coming in.

447
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,715
- All right, look. I need more time.
- No.

448
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,050
All right, I'll paint it myself.

449
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:46,639
All right, but I just-- I gotta have some
more time-- I got my son up in here.

450
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:56,316
All right. One week.
And you paint it.

451
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,828
Chris Gardner?

452
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,122
Yeah. What happened?

453
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:57,210
- Payable to the City of San Francisco.
- Does it have to be the full amount?

454
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,922
You gotta pay each parking ticket,
otherwise, you're staying.

455
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,590
This is all I got.

456
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,765
We verify at 9:30
tomorrow morning.

457
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:14,310
- What?
- You gotta stay until this thing clears.

458
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,064
No.

459
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,066
No, I can't spend the night here.

460
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,861
- I have to pick up my son.
- We verify at 9:30 tomorrow.

461
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:27,699
Sir, I have a job interview at Dean
Witter at 10: 15 tomorrow morning.

462
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,617
- I cannot stay--
- 9:30 tomorrow morning.

463
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,120
What am I supposed to do
with my son?

464
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,789
- Is there anyone else who can--?
- I take care of him.

465
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:38,042
Maybe we can go and have
Social Services pick him up.

466
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,800
All right.
Can I have my phone call, please?

467
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,222
- Hello.
- <i>Hey.</i>

468
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,141
What do you want?

469
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:58,938
You gotta get Christopher
from daycare. I can't.

470
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,776
Just keep him for the night and I'm--
And-- Just one night.

471
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,029
<i>What happened?</i>

472
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:09,699
I'll pick him up
from daycare tomorrow.

473
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,659
I'm gonna go right--
You can just--

474
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,162
You can drop him off
and I'll pick him up.

475
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,957
- No.
- <i>Come on, Linda.</i>

476
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:22,420
- <i>Why you doing that?</i>
- No, I wanna take him to the park.

477
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,966
To Golden Gate
after daycare tomorrow.

478
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,345
- How is he?
- He's fine.

479
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,640
All right, just-- All right,
take him to the park...

480
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:37,644
...and bring him back, all right?

481
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,813
All right, just bring me my son back.

482
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,691
<i>Okay?</i>

483
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,401
<i>Linda?</i>

484
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,528
I'll bring him back around 6.

485
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,532
All right, all right.

486
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,618
Thank you.

487
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,538
Bye.

488
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,065
I'm okay?

489
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,144
Excuse me. Excuse me.

490
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,146
Yes, I did.

491
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,614
Mr. Gardner.

492
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,582
This way.

493
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,836
It'll be right this way.

494
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,349
What is the word on that one?

495
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,873
Chris Gardner.

496
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,127
Chris Gardner.

497
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,546
How are you? Good morning.

498
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:15,009
Chris Gardner. Chris Gardner.
Good to see you again.

499
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,178
Chris Gardner. Pleasure.

500
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,932
I've been sitting there
for the last half-hour...

501
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,683
...trying to come up with a story...

502
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:27,188
...that would explain my being here
dressed like this.

503
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:31,400
And I wanted to come up with a story
that would demonstrate qualities...

504
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:36,447
...that I'm sure you all admire here,
like earnestness or diligence.

505
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:41,369
Team-playing, something.
And I couldn't think of anything.

506
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,288
So the truth is...

507
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,125
... I was arrested
for failure to pay parking tickets.

508
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,210
Parking tickets?

509
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:53,256
And I ran all the way here from
the Polk Station, the police station.

510
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,466
What were you doing
before you were arrested?

511
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,719
I was painting my apartment.

512
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,055
Is it dry now?

513
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,015
I hope so.

514
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,934
Jay says you're pretty determined.

515
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,520
He's been waiting outside
the front of the building...

516
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,856
...with some 40-pound gizmo
for over a month.

517
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:13,442
- He said you're smart.
- Well, I like to think so.

518
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,654
- And you want to learn this business?
- Yes, sir, I wanna learn.

519
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,906
Have you already started learning
on your own?

520
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,741
Absolutely.

521
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,286
- Jay?
- Yes, sir.

522
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,580
How many times
have you seen Chris?

523
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,457
I don't know.
One too many, apparently.

524
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,419
- Was he ever dressed like this?
- No.

525
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,838
No. Jacket and tie.

526
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:38,634
First in your class in school?

527
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,678
- High school?
- Yes, sir.

528
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:44,098
- How many in the class?
- Twelve.

529
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,058
It was a small town.

530
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:49,854
- I'll say.
- But I was also first in my radar class...

531
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,316
...in the Navy,
and that was a class of 20.

532
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,612
Can I say something?

533
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,489
I'm the type of person...

534
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,951
...if you ask me a question,
and I don't know the answer...

535
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,454
... I'm gonna tell you
that I don't know.

536
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:07,955
But I bet you what.

537
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:13,169
I know how to find the answer,
and I will find the answer.

538
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:16,130
Is that fair enough?

539
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:18,549
Chris.

540
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:23,638
What would you say
if a guy walked in for an interview...

541
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,806
...without a shirt on...

542
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,976
...and I hired him?
What would you say?

543
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:36,317
He must've had on
some really nice pants.

544
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:54,543
Chris, I don't know how you did it
dressed as a garbage man...

545
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,004
- ...but you pulled it off.
- Thank you, Mr. Twistle.

546
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,632
Hey, now you can call me Jay.
We'll talk to you soon.

547
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,760
All right, so I'll let you know, Jay.

548
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,846
"You'll let me know, Jay"?
What do you mean?

549
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,015
Yeah, I'll give you a call
tomorrow sometime--

550
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,351
What are you talking--?
You hounded me for this.

551
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,354
- You stood here--
- Listen, there's no salary.

552
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:14,897
- No.
- I was not aware of that.

553
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:16,691
My circumstances
have changed some...

554
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:20,945
- ...and I need to be certain that I'll be--
- All right. Okay.

555
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,700
Tonight.

556
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:29,370
I swear I will fill your spot. I promise.

557
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:32,581
If you back out, you know what
I'll look like to the partners?

558
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,751
Yes, an ass-- A-hole.

559
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:39,463
Yeah, an ass A-hole, all the way.

560
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,927
You are a piece of work.

561
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,555
Tonight.

562
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,773
<i>There was no salary.</i>

563
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,152
<i>Not even a reasonable promise
of a job.</i>

564
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:12,455
<i>One intern was hired at the end
of the programme from a pool of 20.</i>

565
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,081
<i>And if you weren't that guy...</i>

566
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,667
<i>...you couldn't even apply
the six months' training...</i>

567
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,711
<i>...to another brokerage.</i>

568
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,382
<i>The only resource I would have
for six months...</i>

569
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:27,511
<i>...would be my six scanners,
which I could still try to sell.</i>

570
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,183
<i>If I sold them all,
maybe we might get by.</i>

571
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:22,316
- I got him. I got him.
- He's asleep.

572
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:24,026
All right.

573
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:32,326
Okay, baby.

574
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,632
I got it.

575
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,681
I'm going to New York.

576
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,421
My sister's boyfriend...

577
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,508
...opened a restaurant,
and they may have a job for me there.

578
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,761
So I'm going to New York, Chris.

579
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,641
Christopher's staying with me.

580
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:47,401
I'm his mom, you know?

581
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:49,737
He should be with his mom.

582
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,780
I should have him, right?

583
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:55,034
You know
you can't take care of him.

584
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,460
What are you gonna do for money?

585
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:12,218
I had an interview
at Dean Witter for an internship...

586
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,886
...and I got it.

587
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:16,639
So I'm gonna stand out
in my programme.

588
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:20,434
Salesman to intern's backwards.

589
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,603
No, it's not.

590
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,440
I gotta go.

591
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:02,351
Tell him I love him, okay?

592
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,603
And...

593
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,861
I know you'll take care of him, Chris.

594
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,780
I know that.

595
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,116
- <i>Dean Witter.</i>
- Yes, hi.

596
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:03,162
Yes, I'd like to leave a message
for Mr. Jay Twistle.

597
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:06,915
- <i>Your name?</i>
- Yeah, my name is Chris Gardner.

598
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,250
The message is:

599
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:14,131
Thank you very much
for inviting me into the programme.

600
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:20,220
I really appreciate it and I'd be
very pleased to accept your invitation.

601
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,264
<i>Is that all?</i>

602
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,099
Yes, that's it.

603
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,060
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Thank you.

604
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,853
<i>Bye.</i>

605
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,756
- Be careful with that.
- What?

606
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:58,717
Be care-- Go ahead.

607
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:25,494
- Are we there?
- Yep.

608
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,343
- Hey, you know what today is?
- Yeah.

609
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,220
- What?
- Saturday.

610
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:45,723
- You know what Saturday is, right?
- Yeah.

611
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,350
- What?
- Basketball.

612
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:51,478
- You wanna go play some basketball?
- Okay.

613
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,231
All right, then we're gonna go
sell a bone-density scanner.

614
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:58,694
- How about that? Wanna do that?
- No.

615
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,322
Hey, Dad. I'm going pro.

616
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,993
I'm going pro.

617
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,620
Okay.

618
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,623
Yeah, I don't know, you know.

619
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,585
You'll probably be about as good
as I was.

620
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:17,880
That's kind of the way it works,
you know. I was below average.

621
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:21,884
You know, so you'll probably
ultimately rank...

622
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,720
...somewhere around there,
you know, so...

623
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:27,806
... I really-- You'll excel at
a lot of things, just not this.

624
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:30,434
I don't want you shooting
this ball all day and night.

625
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:32,186
- All right?
- All right.

626
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,188
Okay.

627
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:36,982
All right, go ahead.

628
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,424
Hey.

629
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,930
Don't ever let somebody tell you...

630
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,724
...you can't do something.

631
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,519
Not even me.

632
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:18,065
- All right?
- All right.

633
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,901
You got a dream...

634
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,362
...you gotta protect it.

635
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,114
People can't do something
themselves...

636
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,742
...they wanna tell you
you can't do it.

637
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,917
If you want something,
go get it. Period.

638
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:46,510
Let's go.

639
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:52,140
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

640
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,810
I told you. Because I'm getting
a better job.

641
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:59,106
- You gotta trust me, all right?
- I trust you.

642
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:02,067
All right, here.
Come on, come on. Keep up.

643
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:06,280
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

644
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,991
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

645
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,451
I don't know, Christopher.

646
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,704
Dad, listen to this.

647
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:17,374
One day, a man was drowning
in the water.

648
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:20,043
And a boat came by and said,
"Do you need any help?"

649
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,588
He said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

650
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,966
Then another boat came by.
Said, "Do you need any help?"

651
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:28,552
And he said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

652
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,888
Then he drowned,
and he went to heaven.

653
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:34,308
And he said, "God,
why didn't you save me?"

654
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:38,020
And God said, "I sent you
two big boats, you dummy."

655
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:40,772
Do you like it?

656
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,692
Yeah, that's very funny, man.
Give me your hand.

657
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,366
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Yes, sir.

658
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,201
- You got the bill of sale here.
- Yes.

659
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,828
All the information you'll need.

660
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:56,663
Thank you very much
for your business.

661
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,332
Thank you.

662
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:03,795
One hundred, 200,
20, 40, 45, 46...

663
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,631
...7, 8, 9, 10.

664
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:07,341
Thank you.

665
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:12,596
- Hey, you want one of those?
- No, it's okay.

666
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:15,098
Come on, you can have one.
Which one?

667
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,519
- You like that one? How much?
- Twenty-five cents.

668
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,454
<i>This part of my life
is called "internship."</i>

669
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:41,041
The 1200 building is
Medley Industrial and Sanko Oil.

670
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:43,502
The building across the street
is Lee-Ray Shipping.

671
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,587
In a couple weeks,
you'll get call sheets...

672
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:47,631
...with the phone numbers
of employees...

673
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:50,968
...from every <i>Fortune 500</i> company
in the financial district.

674
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,971
You will be pooling
from 60 <i>Fortune</i> companies.

675
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,932
You will mainly be cold-calling
potential clients.

676
00:57:57,099 --> 00:58:00,143
But if you have to have lunch
with them, have breakfast with them...

677
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,605
...even baby-sit for them, do whatever
it takes to familiarize them...

678
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:06,733
...with our packages. We need you
to match their needs and goals...

679
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:11,905
...to one of our many financial plans.
In essence, you reel them in...

680
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:14,199
...we'll cook the fish.

681
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,035
Some of you are here
because you know somebody.

682
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,621
Some of you are here because
you think you're somebody.

683
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:22,416
There's one guy in here
who's gonna be somebody.

684
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,793
That person's gonna be the guy...

685
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,254
...who can turn this into this.

686
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:30,549
Eight hundred thousand
in commission dollars.

687
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,926
You, you, help me hand these out.

688
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:36,805
This is going to be your bible.

689
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:38,348
You'll eat with it.

690
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,267
- You'll drink with it.
- <i>It was simple.</i>

691
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:43,437
<i>X number of calls
equals X number of prospects.</i>

692
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:46,606
<i>X number of prospects
equals X number of customers.</i>

693
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:49,943
<i>X number of customers
equals X number of dollars...</i>

694
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:52,320
- <i>...in the company's pocket.</i>
- Your board exam.

695
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:58,410
Last year, we had an intern score
a 96.4 percent on the written exam.

696
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:01,955
He wasn't chosen.
It's not a simple pass/fail.

697
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:05,584
It's an evaluation tool we use
to separate applicants.

698
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:08,128
Be safe, score a hundred.

699
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:12,299
Okay, let's take a break.
Be back in 10.

700
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:24,478
- Hey, Mr. Frohm. Chris.
- Hi.

701
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,897
- Chris, how are you?
- I'm good. How you doing?

702
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:31,193
- Fine, thank you for asking.
- First day in there. It was exciting.

703
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,487
You're not quitting on us yet,
are you?

704
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,530
No, sir. Ten-minute break.

705
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:38,533
Pop out, get a quick bite and then
back in there for board prep.

706
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,452
Oh, man, I remember mine.

707
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:43,163
And ours were only an hour,
not three like yours.

708
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,791
We didn't do world markets,
didn't bother with taxes...

709
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:49,377
...and it was still a pain in the ass.
Funny what you remember.

710
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,755
There was a beautiful girl
in that class.

711
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,341
I can't remember her name,
but her face was so--

712
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:56,843
I've seen an old friend of mine.
Do you mind?

713
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,846
- No, go ahead.
- Good talking to you, sir.

714
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:33,296
Hey, asshole.
Are you all right, asshole?

715
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:36,466
Are you okay?
What were you thinking?

716
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,885
What are you doing?
I could've killed you.

717
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,346
I'm trying to cross the street.

718
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:45,016
- Well, you're all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

719
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,893
- Where's my shoe?
- What?

720
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,897
- You knocked off my shoe!
- I don't know where your shoe is.

721
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,235
- Where's my damn shoe?
- I don't know.

722
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,534
Hey.

723
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,705
- Did you see it? I lost my shoe.
- No, I'm sorry.

724
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:10,250
Hey. Hey, where are you going?

725
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:13,378
- We should wait for the police.
- I gotta go to work.

726
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:17,799
Hey, you just got hit by a car.
Go to the hospital.

727
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,678
I'm in a competitive internship
at Dean Witter.

728
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,940
Hey, man, you're missing a shoe.

729
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:38,195
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thank you.

730
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:45,452
Dad.

731
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,955
- You don't have a shoe.
- Yeah, I know.

732
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:52,250
- Wanna know what happened?
- Yeah.

733
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,461
I got hit by a car.

734
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:57,339
- You got hit by a car?
- Yep.

735
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:01,176
- Where?
- Just right by the office.

736
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:04,471
- No, where in your body?
- Like, the back of my legs.

737
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,473
- Hey, goodbye, Mrs. Chu.
- Goodbye.

738
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,851
- Where you on the street?
- Yeah, I was running in the street.

739
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:12,979
Don't do that. You can get hurt.

740
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,148
Yeah, thanks.

741
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:17,108
I'll remember that next time.

742
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,820
<i>And here I was again.</i>

743
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,615
- <i>Show up early.</i>
- While qualified persons...

744
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:27,744
...qualified persons are interested in
investing and have money to invest.

745
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:29,829
- Now, Chris.
- Yes, sir.

746
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,082
Would you get me
some coffee, please?

747
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:36,169
<i>Favours for Frakesh,
our office manager. All day.</i>

748
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:38,964
My name is Chris Gardner
calling for Mr. Michael Anderson.

749
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,591
Yes, sir, we're having a lunch
actually this Thursday.

750
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,678
Okay, next time.
All right, I'm gonna hold you to that.

751
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,221
Okay, yes, thank you.

752
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:47,806
Who wants to get me a doughnut?

753
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:51,726
- Chris?
- Yes, sir.

754
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:56,273
<i>Feeling underrated
and unappreciated.</i>

755
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:58,108
Hello, Mr. Ronald Fryer.

756
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:00,610
Good morning to you, sir.
My name is Chris Gardner.

757
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,195
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

758
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:05,573
Yes, I have some very, very valuable
information on what's called a tax--

759
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,034
Okay, thank you, sir.

760
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,873
<i>Then catch the bus by 4 to the place
where they can't spell "happiness."</i>

761
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,834
<i>Then the cross-town.</i>

762
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,211
<i>The 22 home.</i>

763
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:22,090
- Hey, Chris!
- Hey. Hi, Ralph.

764
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:25,218
- I'm waiting.
- All right, I got that for you, Ralph.

765
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:27,470
I'm gonna get that for you.

766
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:39,065
<i>Whoever brought in the most money
after six months was usually hired.</i>

767
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,401
Hello, Chris Gardner calling
for Mr. Walter Hobb.

768
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:44,654
<i>We were all working our way
up call sheets to sign clients.</i>

769
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,157
- <i>From the bottom to the top.</i>
- Yes, sir.

770
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:50,076
- <i>From the doorman to the CEO.</i>
- Okay.

771
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:53,455
<i>They'd stay till 7,
but I had Christopher.</i>

772
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:56,708
<i>I had to do in six hours
what they do in nine.</i>

773
01:03:56,875 --> 01:04:00,045
Good afternoon, my name is Chris
Gardner. I'm calling from Dean Witter.

774
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,838
<i>In order not to waste any time...</i>

775
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:04,257
<i>...I wasn't hanging up the phone
in between calls.</i>

776
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:06,509
Okay, thank you very much.

777
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:10,263
<i>I realized that
by not hanging up the phone...</i>

778
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:12,432
<i>...I gained another eight minutes
a day.</i>

779
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,893
Why, good morning to you,
my name is Chris Gardner.

780
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,604
- I'm calling from Dean Witter.
- <i>I wasn't drinking water...</i>

781
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:19,856
<i>...so I didn't waste any time
in the bathroom.</i>

782
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:22,275
Yes, I'd love to have
the opportunity--

783
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:25,528
Okay, no problem at all, sir.
Thank you very much.

784
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,072
<i>But even doing all this...</i>

785
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:31,368
<i>...after two months, I still didn't have
time to work my way up a sheet.</i>

786
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,133
We're feeling really confident
about that one as well.

787
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,510
<i>Walter Ribbon's office.</i>

788
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,930
Yes, hello, my name is Chris Gardner.
I'm calling for Mr. Walter Ribbon.

789
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:53,306
- <i>Concerning?</i>
- Yes, ma'am.

790
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:54,808
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

791
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,726
<i>Just a moment.</i>

792
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,355
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mr. Ribbon.

793
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:03,525
Hello, sir. My name's Chris Gardner.
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

794
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,485
- <i>Yeah, Chris.</i>
- Yes, Mr. Ribbon...

795
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:09,072
... I would love to have the opportunity
to discuss some of our products.

796
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11,699
I'm certain that I could
be of some assistance to you.

797
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,743
<i>Can you be here in 20 minutes?</i>

798
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:17,997
- Twenty minutes. Absolutely.
- <i>Just had someone cancel.</i>

799
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,291
<i>I can give you a few minutes
before the 49ers.</i>

800
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:23,628
- Monday Night Football, <i>buddy.</i>
- Yes, sir. Thank you very much.

801
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:26,131
- <i>See you soon.</i>
- Bye-bye.

802
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:30,844
Excuse me. Thank you.

803
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,637
- Chris, what's up?
- Hey, Mr. Frakesh.

804
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:34,139
Hey, do you have five minutes?

805
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,015
I got a green light
from Walter Ribbon--

806
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:39,310
I'm supposed to present commodities
to Bromer. Could you move my car?

807
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,772
That'd really help me out. It's on
Samson, half block, silver Caprice.

808
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:46,192
Just move it to the other side. They're
street sweeping. There's spaces.

809
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,945
Hang on to these.
I have backups in my desk.

810
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:50,655
And you have to jimmy that.

811
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,866
- Jimmy what?
- You have to jimmy the key.

812
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:57,704
And the other doors don't unlock.
You have to jimmy it.

813
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,638
Come on, I'm jimmying it.

814
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:20,310
Oh, no!

815
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,062
Come on.

816
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,161
- Here's the file, Mr. Ribbon.
- Thank you.

817
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,877
- Thanks a lot.
- Oh, yeah, thanks. Great idea.

818
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:53,134
No, no, no!

819
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:06,022
Rachel, get Ristuccia on the phone
for me, please.

820
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:55,655
- Hi.
- Hi.

821
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:58,491
I'm Chris Gardner. I have
an appointment with Mr. Ribbon.

822
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:00,076
Oh, you just missed him.

823
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,205
Thank you.

824
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:32,191
- What's that?
- Just filling out a cheque...

825
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,902
...paying some bills...

826
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:37,155
...and a parking ticket.

827
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:41,075
We don't have a car anymore.

828
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,536
Yep, I know.

829
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:50,084
I'm gonna need to take you
with me this weekend.

830
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,545
A couple of doctors' offices.

831
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:56,883
- On sales calls, okay?
- Okay.

832
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:03,765
Then, possibly,
we'll go to the football game.

833
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:06,809
- Really?
- Possibly.

834
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,687
- All right?
- All right.

835
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,981
Come on, finish up.

836
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,443
- Are you sure?
- Possibly.

837
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,237
Really?

838
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:52,730
- Are you bringing it to the game?
- Yeah, I don't wanna leave it.

839
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:55,900
And maybe
we're going to the game.

840
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,364
- Where are we going now?
- To see someone about my job.

841
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:03,449
I don't understand.

842
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:06,828
- You don't understand what?
- Are we going to the game?

843
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:09,580
I said possibly
we're going to the game.

844
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:12,125
- You know what "possibly" means?
- Like probably.

845
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,961
No, "probably" means there's
a good chance that we're going.

846
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:17,922
"Possibly" means we might,
we might not.

847
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:21,175
- What does "probably" mean?
- It means we have a good chance.

848
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,760
And what does "possibly" mean?

849
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,430
- I know what it means.
- What does it mean?

850
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:28,182
It means that we're not going
to the game.

851
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:33,146
- How did you get so smart?
- Because you're smart.

852
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:40,987
- Are we there?
- Yeah.

853
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:48,035
- Mr. Ribbon.
- Yes?

854
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:51,164
How are you, sir?
Chris Gardner. Dean Witter.

855
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,125
- Oh, hi. Hi.
- This is my son, Christopher.

856
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:55,835
- Hi.
- Hey, Christopher.

857
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,463
- What are you doing up here?
- I came to apologise...

858
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:01,340
- ...for missing our appointment.
- You didn't need to come up.

859
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:04,135
We were in the neighbourhood
visiting a very close friend...

860
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:07,847
...and I wanted to take this opportunity
to say thank you for your time.

861
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:10,892
- I know you probably waited for me.
- Little bit.

862
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:13,644
I want you to know
that I do not take that for granted.

863
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,897
Oh, come on. What's that?

864
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:19,567
Oh, it's an Osteo National
bone-density scanner.

865
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:23,321
A company I bought into
prior to going to work at Witter.

866
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:26,199
- I have a meeting after the game.
- You're going to the game?

867
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,159
- Yeah.
- Possibly.

868
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,536
- Possibly.
- We're going too.

869
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,413
I'm taking my son, Tim.
My 12-year-old.

870
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,748
We were just leaving. Tim!

871
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,958
Listen, we'll get out of your way.

872
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,878
Again, thank you very much,
and I'm sorry about the other day.

873
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:41,172
And I hope that
we can reschedule for later.

874
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:42,882
- You got it.
- Thank you very much.

875
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:44,759
You take care. Here, come on.

876
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:46,302
- Say bye-bye, Chris.
- Bye.

877
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,137
Bye, Christopher.

878
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,889
Hey, you guys wanna
come with us?

879
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:53,017
- What--? To Candlestick?
- We're going now. Come with us.

880
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:56,395
- Where are your seats?
- We've-- We're upper deck.

881
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:57,814
We got a box. Come on.

882
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,191
- You wanna sit in the box?
- No.

883
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:05,321
It's not actually a box.
It's, you know, a private section.

884
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,990
It's more comfortable.
You wanna go?

885
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:12,411
- Okay.
- Okay, kids in the back.

886
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:15,248
Hey, why don't you just put that
in your car?

887
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:20,878
- Yeah, okay. Sure, sure.
- We don't have a car.

888
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,965
- Oh, my--
- What happened?

889
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,550
I think I got stung by a bee.

890
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:28,678
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah. Goodness. I'm fine.

891
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,472
- You're not allergic or anything?
- No, no, no.

892
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:35,017
- Where'd he get you?
- Just right at the back of my head.

893
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,645
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Christopher.

894
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:39,981
- Does it hurt?
- Christopher, I'm fine.

895
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:44,068
- Let me see.
- Christopher, sit back. Sit back.

896
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:46,612
<i>Thomas Jefferson mentions
happiness a couple times...</i>

897
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:49,615
<i>...in the Declaration
of Independence.</i>

898
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,618
<i>May seem like a strange word
to be in that document...</i>

899
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:57,790
<i>...but he was sort of...
He was an artist.</i>

900
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:02,587
<i>He called the English
"the disturbers of our harmony."</i>

901
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:04,630
<i>And I remember standing there
that day...</i>

902
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,133
<i>...thinking about
the disturbers of mine.</i>

903
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:11,637
<i>Questions I had:
Whether all this was good.</i>

904
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:13,764
<i>Whether I'd make it.</i>

905
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:19,770
<i>And Walter Ribbon
and his Pacific Bell pension money...</i>

906
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,314
<i>...which was millions.</i>

907
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,149
Yeah!

908
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:26,527
<i>It was a way to another place.</i>

909
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,405
Wow, this is...

910
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,741
This is the way
to watch a football game here.

911
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:35,036
- Thank you very much for this, really.
- Hey, it's my pleasure, Chris.

912
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:38,497
And, Mr. Ribbon, I also wanna thank
you for giving me the opportunity...

913
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:41,584
...to discuss the asset management
capabilities of Dean Witter...

914
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:44,045
...which we believe
to be far superior...

915
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:46,839
...to anything you got going
over at Morgan Stanley.

916
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:48,883
Really, I think you're gonna
be blown away.

917
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:54,138
Point blank, Dean Witter needs to be
managing your retirement portfolio.

918
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:56,891
You know, I didn't have any notion
that you were new there.

919
01:13:57,058 --> 01:14:00,561
I like you, but there's not a chance
I'm gonna let you direct our fund.

920
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:02,855
That's just not gonna happen
anytime soon, buddy.

921
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:06,192
So, you know, come on, relax.
Enjoy the game. Go, go, go!

922
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,444
Yes!

923
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:13,532
Yes! Yeah!

924
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:19,246
- Here you go.
- All right.

925
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:21,207
I've had a few ideas
already, absolutely.

926
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:24,001
- Chris, I'll talk to you later.
- I'm gonna give you a call.

927
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:25,878
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Give me a call.

928
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,713
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

929
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,264
- Bye.
- Bye, Christopher.

930
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:11,298
<i>After four months, we had sold
all our scanners.</i>

931
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,968
<i>It seemed we were making it.</i>

932
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,137
What's the...

933
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:19,015
- ...fastest animal in the world?
- Jackrabbit.

934
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:24,645
<i>It seemed we were doing good.</i>

935
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:26,605
<i>Till one day...</i>

936
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:28,566
<i>...that day...</i>

937
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:31,068
<i>...that letter brought me
back to earth.</i>

938
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:41,037
<i>This part of my life is called
"Paying Taxes."</i>

939

<i>If you didn't pay them...</i>

940
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:47,543
<i>...the government could stick
their hands into your bank account...</i>

941
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:49,462
<i>...and take your money.</i>

942
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:50,629
Dad.

943
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,798
<i>No warning. Nothing.</i>

944
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:56,135
It can't be too late.
That's my money.

945
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:59,472
How is somebody just gonna
just take my money?

946
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:01,098
I was-- I was--

947
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:04,643
Listen, I--
That's all the money that I have.

948
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:09,148
You cannot go into my bank acc--
No--

949
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,692
<i>It was the 25th of September.</i>

950
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:13,611
<i>I remember that day.</i>

951
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:15,905
<i>Because that's the day
that I found out...</i>

952
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:21,243
<i>...there was only 21 dollars
and 33 cents left in my bank account.</i>

953
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,162
<i>I was broke.</i>

954
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:35,841
- Dressed yet?
- No.

955
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:43,015
Chris! Chris!
Don't jerk me around, okay, Chris?

956
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:46,018
I'm not jerking you around, Ralph,
all right? I'm gonna get it.

957
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:49,772
- I need that money now, not later.
- When I get it, you get it, Ralph.

958
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:51,857
Now!

959
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:57,613
Hey, what's happening, man?

960
01:16:57,822 --> 01:17:00,699
Wayne, I need to get
that $14 from you.

961
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:04,245
I thought I didn't owe you that now.

962
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:07,540
- What? Why?
- Why what?

963
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:10,084
Why would you think
you don't owe me my money?

964
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:12,253
I helped you move.

965
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:17,383
You drove me two blocks, Wayne.

966
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,385
That's 200 yards.

967
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,512
It's been four months, Wayne.

968
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:25,307
I need my money. I need my money.
I need my money right now.

969
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,852
- I don't have it, man. I'm sorry.
- Go get my money.

970
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:30,271
- Wayne, get my mo--
- I really don't, man. It's $14.

971
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,189
It's my $14!
Go get my money!

972
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:34,942
- All of this for $14.
- Get my money, Wayne.

973
01:17:53,252 --> 01:17:55,462
Dad, look at me!

974
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,631
Dad.

975
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:02,178
- Should I go?
- Sure, man. Why not?

976
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:19,278
- Stay here.
- Dad, look.

977
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:21,113
- No, no. Stay right here.
- Dad.

978
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,074
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear me?

979
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:32,666
- Dad, where you going?
- Hey, what did I say?

980
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,338
Dad!

981
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:40,966
Dad, wait! Dad!

982
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:51,143
- Dad.
- I gotta--

983
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:54,730
I gotta get back to the '60s, man.
That's what I wanna do.

984
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:59,235
When I was younger. I wanna see
Jimi Hendrix do that guitar on fire.

985
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:04,990
Bring back my time machine!

986
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:07,993
Bring my time machine back!

987
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:20,506
- Dad, where are we going?
- Be quiet.

988
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:23,842
Go get your things. Go.

989
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:48,701
- Chris?
- Yes.

990
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:52,830
Dr. Telm can't get back to meet you.
I'm sorry.

991
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:06,468
Where are we going now?

992
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:10,514
Gotta-- We gotta
see somebody else.

993
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:14,727
I'm tired.

994
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,397
I know.

995
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:29,867
Doesn't seem to be functioning
right now.

996
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:32,578
- I have to go now, Chris.
- No, no, no.

997
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:36,665
Just give me a second. I'm sure
I'm gonna be able to figure it out.

998
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,753
Chris. Chris, just come back
when it's working.

999
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:43,797
- No, no. I have to fix it now.
- No.

1000
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:49,261
Look, I'll still be putting money
in the office, then, all right?

1001
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:51,597
I really have to go, Chris.

1002
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:54,475
Thank you. Thank you.

1003
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:56,560
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.

1004
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:58,437
I'll see you soon.

1005
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:52,866
Why are our things here?

1006
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:55,494
Dad.

1007
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:40,747
- Let's go. Come on.
- Where?

1008
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:44,710
- Just out of here.
- Why?

1009
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:47,880
- We can't stay here tonight.
- Yes, we can. Open the door!

1010
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:51,049
- Did you hear what I said? Let's go.
- Open the door!

1011
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:56,638
Hey, did you hear what I said?
Stop it.

1012
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,348
Stop it.

1013
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:04,062
Come on.

1014
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:14,615
Come on.

1015
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,258
<i>Wayne!</i>

1016
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:36,261
Wayne!

1017
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:45,771
Wayne!

1018
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:04,998
Get up. Stand up. Come on.

1019
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:22,891
Where are we going?

1020
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:28,397
- Dad, where are we going?
- I don't know.

1021
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:46,290
It's not a time machine.

1022
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:47,916
Dad.

1023
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,626
It's not a time machine.

1024
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:53,088
The guy said it was a time machine.
It's not a time machine. He was wrong.

1025
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:55,841
- What guy?
- The guy. He was at the park.

1026
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:58,010
He said it was a time machine.

1027
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:05,559
Yes, it is.

1028
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:08,937
No, it's not.

1029
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:12,899
- It is.
- No, it's not.

1030
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:23,660
All we gotta do is push
this black button right here.

1031
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:27,998
Wanna push it?

1032
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:34,171
Okay.

1033
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:37,299
Come on.

1034
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:40,427
Come on, man.

1035
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:47,184
Right here.

1036
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:49,186
Wait a minute.
Where you wanna go?

1037
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,563
I don't know.
Some place from before.

1038
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:53,315
You gotta close your eyes.

1039
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:55,484
You close your eyes. I wanna see.

1040
01:25:57,611 --> 01:26:00,072
All right, come on.
We'll push it together.

1041
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:07,704
You gotta close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

1042
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:10,582
It takes a few seconds.

1043
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:14,920
Oh, my goodness.

1044
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:17,297
Open, open, open!

1045
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:23,345
- What is it?
- Dinosaurs.

1046
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:25,764
- Where?
- You don't see all these dinosaurs?

1047
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:30,769
Look around.
Look at all these dinosaurs.

1048
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,940
- Can you see them?
- Yeah.

1049
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:36,525
Wait. Come on, come on.

1050
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:38,068
- Wait, watch out.
- What is it?

1051
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:40,320
Don't step in the fire.
We're cavemen.

1052
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:42,948
We need this fire,
because there's no electricity...

1053
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:44,533
...and it's cold out here, okay?

1054
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,619
- Watch out!
- Whoa! Oh, my good-- A <i>T. rex.</i>

1055
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:51,456
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Get it.

1056
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:55,502
- We gotta find someplace safe.
- Like what?

1057
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:57,671
We need a cave.

1058
01:26:57,838 --> 01:26:58,964
A cave?

1059
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,216
- We gotta find a cave. Come on.
- Okay.

1060
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:03,176
Come on, come on.

1061
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,138
Watch your back! Look out.

1062
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:08,390
Here it is. Here's a cave. Come on.

1063
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:11,476
Right here, right here.
Go, go, go.

1064
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:12,936
Go ahead. Get in.

1065
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:14,980
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1066
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:22,362
- Are we safe?
- Yeah, I think so.

1067
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:31,973
Hey.

1068
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:35,227
- How you doing, Jay?
- I'm doing good.

1069
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:36,853
How are you getting along?

1070
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,231
- Good. I'm good.
- You doing good?

1071
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:41,983
- How you doing?
- I'm doing great.

1072
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:44,736
Where you going?

1073
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:51,076
I-- Sacramento.

1074
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:54,371
Because I'm trying to move
a couple guys from--

1075
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:57,207
They're at PacBell,
and I'm trying to bring them over--

1076
01:28:57,374 --> 01:28:58,667
Get them over to us.

1077
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:00,585
So they got me
going out there golfing.

1078
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:02,629
Awesome.

1079
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:04,798
Hey, let them win a round.

1080
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:11,972
Deborah, someone's asking for you.

1081
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:15,267
- Where?
- He's outside. Please come with me.

1082
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:26,278
- Hi.
- How you doing?

1083
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:30,574
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1084
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:34,452
We need a room.

1085
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:37,998
Just until I can fix this and sell it.

1086
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:40,834
- There's just some glass work.
- Let me stop you right there.

1087
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:43,503
- I wish I could help you--
- This is my son, Christopher.

1088
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:45,839
- He's 5 years old.
- Hi, baby.

1089
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:49,134
- We need some place to stay.
- Okay, and I would love to help you...

1090
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:52,178
...but we don't take men here.
It's only women and children.

1091
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:55,473
He can stay here, but you have
to find someplace else to go.

1092
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,058
We gotta stay together.

1093
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:58,643
We got-- We're--

1094
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,645
- Okay, listen.
- You gotta have some place--

1095
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:03,732
Try Glide Memorial.
The building books up at 5.

1096
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:05,442
So you hurry up. There's a line.

1097
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:09,029
- And where is it? Come on.
- Ellis and Jones.

1098
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:49,903
Hey, everybody. We have
four spots left, and that's all.

1099
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:53,198
- Man.
- Hey, come on, man.

1100
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:54,616
- Come on.
- Come on, what?

1101
01:30:54,783 --> 01:30:56,409
- Hey, that's my spot.
- Back off.

1102
01:30:56,576 --> 01:30:59,037
Come on, don't do this to me.
Don't--

1103
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:02,999
Dad!

1104
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:05,502
Stop it! Break it up!
Break it up!

1105
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:07,295
Stop! Stop!

1106
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:09,798
Get out of line, both of you.
Both of you.

1107
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:12,592
I was here first. They told me
that we had to be on time.

1108
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:14,844
I got here on time. I was in line.

1109
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:16,805
I came from work, I got my son.

1110
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:19,557
I was here on time.
We were here on time!

1111
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,351
He sliced in front of him in line.

1112
01:31:21,518 --> 01:31:23,853
- Who did?
- He did.

1113
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:28,650
Come on, come on, Rodney.
Come on. Let's go. Get out of line.

1114
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:39,911
That's it. No more.

1115
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:49,879
- What's your favourite colour?
- Green.

1116
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:51,339
Green?

1117
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:54,551
- What do you like that's green?
- Trees.

1118
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:57,762
Trees. What else?

1119
01:31:57,929 --> 01:31:59,431
Holly.

1120
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:05,145
- Holly. What's holly?
- The Christmas stuff.

1121
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:07,897
Christmas stuff.

1122
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:10,442
What's that?

1123
01:32:13,611 --> 01:32:16,573
I guess they want us to go to sleep.

1124
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:28,126
Here you go. We gotta make sure
Captain America's warm in there.

1125
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,295
Can he breathe?

1126
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:32,797
- He's good?
- Yeah.

1127
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:35,216
- I gotta go work on the scanner--
- Don't go.

1128
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:38,636
No, no, no. I'm gonna be
right outside the door.

1129
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:42,974
All right? I'm just gonna be right there.
I'll leave the door open a little bit.

1130
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:46,144
And I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1131
01:32:46,311 --> 01:32:48,813
I wanna go home.

1132
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:54,694
But that's why I gotta
work on the scanner.

1133
01:32:55,612 --> 01:32:57,405
All right?

1134
01:32:57,572 --> 01:32:59,532
I'm gonna go out there.

1135
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:03,119
I'm gonna leave the door open.
I'll be right up the stairs.

1136
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:05,914
I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1137
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:09,000
- All right?
- All right.

1138
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:11,544
You gotta trust me, okay?

1139
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:13,797
You gotta trust me.

1140
01:33:14,631 --> 01:33:17,342
I trust you. I trust you.

1141
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:18,968
I trust you.

1142
01:33:19,135 --> 01:33:22,180
- I can't hear you.
- I trust you. I trust you.

1143
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:27,685
Give me a kiss.

1144
01:33:40,323 --> 01:33:43,326
- I'll just be a little while, okay?
- All right.

1145
01:33:43,743 --> 01:33:46,246
- I'll be right here.
- Okay.

1146
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:48,665
- Can you still hear me?
- Yeah.

1147
01:33:48,832 --> 01:33:50,375
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

1148
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:53,044
- Do you trust me?
- Yeah.

1149
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:41,926
- Yeah.
- Like that?

1150
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:45,805
- Yeah, put that...
- Then you go like that.

1151
01:34:45,972 --> 01:34:49,517
- Is that okay?
- I don't know. What do you think?

1152
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:50,768
Good.

1153
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:54,355
Let's go. Get your stuff.

1154
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:58,568
- Hey, why don't you leave it?
- We can't.

1155
01:34:58,735 --> 01:35:00,904
We're gonna have
a different room later.

1156
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:02,655
Go.

1157
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:09,370
Hey, Chris.

1158
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:12,916
- Hey, good morning, Mr. Frakesh.
- What's up?

1159
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:15,126
Work trip.

1160
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:17,587
Your wife, Martha, works at
PacBell also, correct?

1161
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:19,547
- Yes, she does.
- And you guys are both...

1162
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:21,424
...looking to retire at the same time?

1163
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:23,718
We'd like to retire
and maintain our lifestyle...

1164
01:35:23,885 --> 01:35:25,345
...without paying a lot of taxes.

1165
01:35:25,511 --> 01:35:29,057
So basically, you want nobody's hands
in your pockets but your own?

1166
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:31,559
Are you familiar with
tax-free municipal...?

1167
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:33,645
<i>I learned to finish my work quickly.</i>

1168
01:35:33,937 --> 01:35:36,147
<i>I had to finish quickly.</i>

1169
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:39,984
<i>To get in line at Glide by 5.</i>

1170
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:45,657
Come on.

1171
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:47,700
Come on.

1172
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:54,582
Hold that bus! Hold the bus!

1173
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:57,210
My Captain America!

1174
01:35:57,418 --> 01:35:59,754
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1175
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:03,216
Stop it! Shut up! Shut up!

1176
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:07,595
- Why don't you let the lady in?
- Hey, back up.

1177
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:10,848
- Hey, man, that's not cool.
- Back up! Back up!

1178
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:20,650
Come on.

1179
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:25,863
Dad, we need to get it!

1180
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:31,119
<i>The important thing about
that freedom train...</i>

1181
01:36:31,286 --> 01:36:33,496
<i>...is it's got to climb mountains.</i>

1182
01:36:33,663 --> 01:36:36,457
<i>We all have to deal with mountains.</i>

1183
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:39,585
<i>You know, mountains
that go way up high.</i>

1184
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:42,046
And mountains that go
deep and low.

1185
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:43,506
- Amen, preacher!
- Yes.

1186
01:36:43,673 --> 01:36:46,009
We know what those mountains are,
here at Glide.

1187
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:48,428
We sing about them.

1188
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:54,726
<i>Lord, don't move that mountain</i>

1189
01:36:56,102 --> 01:37:02,567
<i>Give me strength to climb it</i>

1190
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:09,741
<i>Please don't move
That stumbling block</i>

1191
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:16,539
<i>But lead me, Lord, around it</i>

1192
01:37:18,124 --> 01:37:23,212
<i>My burdens, they get so heavy</i>

1193
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:30,678
<i>Seems hard to bear</i>

1194
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:35,183
<i>But I won't give up
No, no</i>

1195
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:37,435
<i>Because you promised me</i>

1196
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:44,359
<i>You'd meet me at the altar of prayer</i>

1197
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:52,116
<i>-Lord don't move that mountain
- Please don't move that mountain</i>

1198
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:57,580
<i>But give me strength to climb it</i>

1199
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:01,793
When's your test?

1200
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,504
Tomorrow.

1201
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:10,676
Are you ready?

1202
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:16,015
Of course.

1203
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:56,431
Thank you, sir.

1204
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:08,025
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hey.

1205
01:39:11,988 --> 01:39:15,032
So did you finish the whole thing,
or you have to go somewhere...?

1206
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,702
I have to go somewhere.

1207
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:21,080
- But I finished the whole thing too.
- Oh, good.

1208
01:39:21,247 --> 01:39:23,207
- You?
- Yeah.

1209
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:26,711
- How'd you feel about the graphs?
- Easy.

1210
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:31,757
I struggled with the essay question
on the back. What did you write?

1211
01:39:31,924 --> 01:39:35,595
- Essay question?
- Yeah, on the back.

1212
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:46,898
Hey, Chris.

1213
01:39:47,064 --> 01:39:50,359
- Hey. Jeff, right? 49ers game.
- Yeah.

1214
01:39:50,526 --> 01:39:54,071
- Yeah, you were gonna give me a call?
- I never actually got your number.

1215
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:57,742
Here's my number. Call me, okay?

1216
01:39:57,909 --> 01:40:00,620
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Thank you very much.

1217
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:05,166
Chris, you got five bucks?
I left my wallet upstairs.

1218
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:07,627
Let me run up and grab that
for you, Mr. Frohm.

1219
01:40:07,793 --> 01:40:10,838
No, I gotta be at CAL Bank at 4,
and I'm late.

1220
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:18,387
- I'll pay you back, honest.
- Five is good?

1221
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:22,225
Five is lovely. Thank you.
Thank you.

1222
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:38,074
That's it. That's the room quota.

1223
01:40:38,407 --> 01:40:41,202
There's no more space.
You gotta head out.

1224
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:44,288
That's it for today.
Come back tomorrow.

1225
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:47,500
All the rooms are full.
It's completely full.

1226
01:40:47,667 --> 01:40:52,004
That's it. Just keep heading out.
Come back tomorrow.

1227
01:41:26,956 --> 01:41:28,749
You like it?

1228
01:42:19,759 --> 01:42:23,471
Twenty. One, two, three, four.

1229
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:30,186
Now, here's your bulb,
and there's your ferrite core inductor.

1230
01:42:30,353 --> 01:42:33,189
- How much?
- Eight dollars.

1231
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:37,610
- What's that?
- It's to repair the light.

1232
01:42:37,777 --> 01:42:39,862
Can I see it?

1233
01:42:41,739 --> 01:42:44,825
Yeah, sure. Just don't break it.

1234
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:49,538
Unless you wanna sleep in a room
with me for the rest of your life.

1235
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:52,583
I don't mind.

1236
01:42:53,042 --> 01:42:54,919
Yeah, you will.

1237
01:43:11,143 --> 01:43:13,562
Why don't you
get some sleep, okay?

1238
01:43:13,729 --> 01:43:14,939
Okay.

1239
01:43:15,106 --> 01:43:18,234
- Warm enough?
- Yeah.

1240
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:20,152
All right.

1241
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:25,157
Did Mom leave because of me?

1242
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:32,707
- What?
- Did Mom leave because of me?

1243
01:43:37,253 --> 01:43:41,799
Don't-- Don't even think
something like that.

1244
01:43:42,842 --> 01:43:45,010
Mom left because of Mom.

1245
01:43:45,177 --> 01:43:47,471
And you didn't have anything
to do with that, okay?

1246
01:43:48,139 --> 01:43:50,099
Okay.

1247
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,986
You're a good papa.

1248
01:44:09,827 --> 01:44:11,829
All right, go to sleep.

1249
01:44:12,621 --> 01:44:15,583
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1250
01:45:12,014 --> 01:45:14,058
So far, so good, Chris.

1251
01:45:20,064 --> 01:45:22,691
- It works.
- Thank you very much.

1252
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:26,737
<i>Two hundred and fifty dollars.
Four more weeks of oxygen.</i>

1253
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:31,283
One hundred, 20, 40, 60, 80, 200.

1254
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:34,245
Twenty, 30, 40, 50.

1255
01:45:35,371 --> 01:45:37,039
- Anything else?
- Nope, that's good.

1256
01:45:37,206 --> 01:45:38,582
Thank you. Thank you.

1257
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:40,709
- You ready?
- Yep.

1258
01:45:42,586 --> 01:45:45,548
- Are we going to the church place?
- No.

1259
01:45:45,714 --> 01:45:47,716
Where are we going, then?

1260
01:45:48,467 --> 01:45:51,095
- Probably stay at a hotel.
- A hotel?

1261
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:52,346
Just for the night.

1262
01:45:52,513 --> 01:45:55,307
We can go back to the cave
if you like.

1263
01:45:55,474 --> 01:45:57,268
No, thank you.

1264
01:45:57,434 --> 01:45:59,979
- Ever?
- I hope not.

1265
01:46:00,145 --> 01:46:01,647
Why not?

1266
01:46:01,814 --> 01:46:04,650
Well, because some things are fun
the first time you do them...

1267
01:46:04,817 --> 01:46:07,194
...and then not so much the next.

1268
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:10,281
- Like the bus?
- Yeah, like the bus.

1269
01:46:10,447 --> 01:46:13,826
<i>I'm sorry. Guess I shouldn't laugh,
should I?</i>

1270
01:46:13,993 --> 01:46:17,454
<i>It's promised in the Bible.
Pa says we'll find it some day.</i>

1271
01:46:17,621 --> 01:46:19,874
<i>He doesn't know where it is, though.</i>

1272
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:24,253
<i>Didn't you ever want to have a home
of your own like other people?</i>

1273
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:26,130
<i>Sure.</i>

1274
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:28,632
<i>Sometimes when we're moving
at night...</i>

1275
01:46:28,799 --> 01:46:31,927
<i>...we pass houses with lights
and people.</i>

1276
01:46:32,094 --> 01:46:34,805
<i>Sometimes you can
hear them laughing...</i>

1277
01:46:39,351 --> 01:46:42,771
<i>The next day, after work...</i>

1278
01:46:42,938 --> 01:46:45,190
<i>...we just went to the beach.</i>

1279
01:46:45,357 --> 01:46:47,318
<i>Far away from anything.</i>

1280
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:48,861
<i>Everything.</i>

1281
01:46:49,028 --> 01:46:50,738
<i>Just Christopher and me.</i>

1282
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:54,742
- Did you see me?
- Yeah.

1283
01:46:54,909 --> 01:46:58,037
<i>Far away from buses and noise...</i>

1284
01:46:58,203 --> 01:47:03,876
<i>...and a constant disappointment
in my ten-gallon head...</i>

1285
01:47:05,002 --> 01:47:06,921
<i>...and in myself.</i>

1286
01:47:07,504 --> 01:47:09,882
- Chris, thank you very much.
- Well, thank you, Dean.

1287
01:47:10,049 --> 01:47:11,926
- Take care.
- You made all the right moves.

1288
01:47:12,092 --> 01:47:13,677
Thanks, Chris.

1289
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:17,056
<i>Because when I was young...</i>

1290
01:47:17,222 --> 01:47:21,018
<i>...and I'd get an A on a history test
or whatever...</i>

1291
01:47:21,185 --> 01:47:25,856
<i>...I'd get this good feeling about
all the things that I could be.</i>

1292
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:31,362
<i>And then I never became
any of them.</i>

1293
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:41,413
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey.

1294
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:44,249
- How you doing, Jay?
- I'm doing fine.

1295
01:47:44,416 --> 01:47:48,587
Rumour has it you signed 31 accounts
for us from Pacific Bell.

1296
01:47:48,754 --> 01:47:50,214
Yeah, yeah.

1297
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:54,218
Met some guys at a ball game,
got some cards. I've been working.

1298
01:47:54,385 --> 01:47:56,053
I guess.

1299
01:47:59,014 --> 01:48:01,266
So one more day.

1300
01:48:01,433 --> 01:48:03,060
Getting nervous?

1301
01:48:03,602 --> 01:48:06,021
- No, I'm okay.
- Yeah?

1302
01:48:06,188 --> 01:48:08,148
Listen, whatever happens...

1303
01:48:08,315 --> 01:48:10,776
...you've done a fantastic job, Chris.

1304
01:48:10,943 --> 01:48:12,569
I mean that.

1305
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:15,239
Take care of yourself.

1306
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:33,424
Yes, Mr. Johnson.
Chris Gardner, Dean Witter.

1307
01:48:33,674 --> 01:48:35,801
Yes, sir. Just calling
to thank you very much...

1308
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:38,512
...for your support
at last month's seminar.

1309
01:48:39,013 --> 01:48:40,723
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

1310
01:48:41,306 --> 01:48:42,975
Yes, sir.

1311
01:48:43,142 --> 01:48:44,560
No, sir, that's it.

1312
01:48:44,727 --> 01:48:47,271
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

1313
01:48:48,814 --> 01:48:51,734
Chris. Come.

1314
01:49:19,094 --> 01:49:22,222
- Hi, Chris.
- Mr. Frohm, good to see you.

1315
01:49:23,307 --> 01:49:25,309
- Nice shirt.
- Thank you, sir.

1316
01:49:25,476 --> 01:49:26,685
- Chris.
- Hey, Jay.

1317
01:49:27,102 --> 01:49:31,398
- Chris.
- Chris, sit down, please.

1318
01:49:34,318 --> 01:49:38,405
I thought I'd wear a shirt today.

1319
01:49:38,572 --> 01:49:40,574
You know,
being the last day and all.

1320
01:49:40,741 --> 01:49:44,119
Well, thank you. Thank you.
We appreciate that.

1321
01:49:44,995 --> 01:49:46,789
But...

1322
01:49:46,955 --> 01:49:49,792
...wear one tomorrow though, okay?

1323
01:49:49,958 --> 01:49:52,920
Because tomorrow's
going to be your first day...

1324
01:49:53,629 --> 01:49:56,882
...if you'd like to work here
as a broker.

1325
01:49:58,175 --> 01:50:00,052
Would you like that, Chris?

1326
01:50:00,928 --> 01:50:02,554
Yes, sir.

1327
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:06,141
Good. We couldn't be happier.

1328
01:50:07,059 --> 01:50:10,270
So welcome.

1329
01:50:12,106 --> 01:50:17,152
- Was it as easy as it looked?
- No, sir. No, sir, it wasn't.

1330
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:21,865
- Good luck, Chris.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1331
01:50:28,247 --> 01:50:30,165
Oh, Chris.

1332
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:34,753
I almost forgot.

1333
01:50:36,755 --> 01:50:38,382
Thank you.

1334
01:50:58,735 --> 01:51:00,946
<i>This part of my life...</i>

1335
01:51:01,822 --> 01:51:04,074
<i>...this little part...</i>

1336
01:51:07,369 --> 01:51:10,038
<i>...is called "Happiness."</i>

1337
01:51:56,710 --> 01:52:00,380
Christopher. Christopher.
Come here.

1338
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:32,454
So how many...

1339
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:34,581
...planets are there?

1340
01:52:35,832 --> 01:52:37,668
- Seven.
- Seven?

1341
01:52:38,168 --> 01:52:40,003
Nine.

1342
01:52:42,339 --> 01:52:44,466
Who's the king of the jungle?

1343
01:52:44,841 --> 01:52:47,594
- Gorilla.
- The gorilla?

1344
01:52:47,844 --> 01:52:49,304
The gorilla?

1345
01:52:49,471 --> 01:52:51,181
No. Lion.

1346
01:52:51,348 --> 01:52:53,976
Oh, yeah. Lion, lion, lion.

1347
01:52:56,019 --> 01:52:59,022
Hey, Dad, listen to this.
Knock, knock.

1348
01:52:59,189 --> 01:53:01,191
- Who's there?
- Shelby.

1349
01:53:01,358 --> 01:53:02,484
Shelby who?

1350
01:53:02,651 --> 01:53:06,488
<i>Shelby coming around the mountain
When she comes</i>

1351
01:53:07,281 --> 01:53:08,699
- Knock knock.
- Who's there?

1352
01:53:08,865 --> 01:53:11,368
- Nobody.
- Nobody who?

1353
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:14,037
Nobody who?

1354
01:53:17,291 --> 01:53:20,294
Now, that's funny. I like that one.
