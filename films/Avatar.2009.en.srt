1
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,159
When I was lying there in the VA hospital,

2
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,000
with a big hole blown through the middle of my life,

3
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,080
I started having these dreams of flying.

4
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,710
I was free.

5
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,510
Sooner or later, though,

6
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,800
you always have to wake up.

7
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,150
In cryo, you don't dream at all.

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,319
It doesn't feel like six years.

9
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,700
More like a fifth of tequila and an ass-kicking.

10
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,170
Tommy was the scientist, not me.

11
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,549
He was the one who wanted to get shot

12
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,630
light-years out in space to find the answers.

13
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,670
Are we there yet?

14
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,090
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

15
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,299
We're there.

16
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,890
It's about your brother.

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,850
So, a week before Tommy's gonna ship out,

18
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,900
a guy with a gun ends his journey

19
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,190
for the paper in his wallet.

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,319
You've been in cryo for five years, nine months and 22 days.

21
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,319
You will be hungry. You will be weak.

22
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,989
If you feel nausea, please use the sacks...

23
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,079
Yeah, Tommy was the scientist.

24
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,750
Me, I'm just another dumb grunt going someplace he's gonna regret.

25
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,270
Up ahead was Pandora.

26
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,980
You grew up hearing about it,

27
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,650
but I never figured I'd be going there.

28
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,659
Your brother represented a significant investment.

29
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,999
We'd like to talk to you about taking over his contract.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,659
And since your genome is identical to his,

31
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,620
you could step into his shoes,

32
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,130
so to speak.

33
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,760
It'd be a fresh start on a new world.

34
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,980
And the pay is good.

35
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,110
Very good.

36
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,299
Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!

37
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,919
Exo-packs on! Let's go!

38
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,179
Remember, people, you lose that mask, you're unconscious in 20 seconds,

39
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,929
you're dead in four minutes!

40
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,559
Let's nobody be dead today!

41
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,350
Looks very bad on my report.

42
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,809
Hell's Gate tower, this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

43
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,860
Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.

44
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,270
One life ends,

45
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,270
another begins.

46
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,029
Harnesses off! Get your packs!

47
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,619
-Put it together, let's go! -Harnesses off!

48
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,789
-One minute! -Let's go!

49
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,369
When that ramp comes down, go directly into the base.

50
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,869
Do not stop!

51
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,630
Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!

52
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,469
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there!

53
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,260
Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

54
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,930
There's no such thing as an ex-Marine.

55
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,690
You may be out,

56
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,150
but you never lose the attitude.

57
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,900
I told myself I could pass any test a man could pass.

58
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,739
They can fix a spinal, if you got the money,

59
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,540
but not on vet benefits, not in this economy.

60
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,169
Let's go, special case! Do not make me wait for you!

61
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,170
Well, well, ladies.

62
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,209
Look at all this fresh meat!

63
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,920
Whoo!

64
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,389
Back on Earth, these guys were Army dogs, Marines,

65
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,020
fighting for freedom.

66
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,270
Look out, hot rod!

67
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,569
But out here they're just hired guns,

68
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,529
taking the money, working for the company.

69
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,950
Check this out, man.

70
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,080
Meals on wheels.

71
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,329
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

72
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,369
I got two guys free in about 20 minutes!

73
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,920
Got it! Need them!

74
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,680
You're not in Kansas anymore.

75
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,480
You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.

76
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,940
Respect that fact every second of every day.

77
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,230
If there is a hell,

78
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,820
you might want to go there for some R&R after a tour on Pandora.

79
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,280
Out there, beyond that fence,

80
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,289
every living thing that crawls, flies or squats in the mud

81
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,540
wants to kill you and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

82
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,550
We have an indigenous population of humanoids called the Na'vi.

83
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,629
They're fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin

84
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,349
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

85
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,930
And they have bones reinforced with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

86
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,390
They are very hard to kill.

87
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,150
As head of security, it is my job to keep you alive.

88
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,570
I will not succeed.

89
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,240
Not with all of you.

90
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,949
If you wish to survive,

91
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,080
you need to cultivate a strong mental attitude.

92
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,250
You've got to obey the rules.

93
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Pandora rules.

94
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,009
Rule number one...

95
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,759
There's nothing like an old-school safety brief

96
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,090
to put your mind at ease.

97
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,800
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!

98
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,560
You're Jake, right?

99
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,270
Tom's brother.

100
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,349
Wow! You look just like him.

101
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,349
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.

102
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,189
I went through avatar training with him.

103
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,400
...into the bio-lab.

104
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,529
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.

105
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,529
Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

106
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,619
-Hi. -Hey.

107
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,529
Uh, link... Here's the link room right here.

108
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,910
This is where we're connecting to the avatar...

109
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,709
Me and Norm are here to drive

110
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,999
these remotely-controlled bodies called avatars.

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,129
And they're grown from human DNA mixed with the DNA of the natives.

112
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,179
-Hey. Welcome. -Hey.

113
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,010
Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.

114
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,519
Damn! They got big.

115
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,099
Yeah, they fully mature on the flight out.

116
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,479
So the proprioceptive sims seem to work really well.

117
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,519
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

118
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,439
It'll take us a few hours to get them decanted,

119
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,040
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

120
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,900
There's yours.

121
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,069
-Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman. -Dr. Max Patel.

122
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,030
-Great to meet you. -Good to meet you, yeah.

123
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,480
Looks like him.

124
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,100
No, it looks like you.

125
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,900
This is your avatar now, Jake.

126
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,280
And the concept is that every driver is matched to his own avatar,

127
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,830
so that their nervous systems are in tune...

128
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,950
or something.

129
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,250
Which is why they offered me the gig, because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

130
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,130
which is insanely expensive.

131
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,379
Is this right? I just say whatever to the video log?

132
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,589
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit of documenting everything.

133
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,759
You know, what we see, what we feel.

134
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,519
-It's all part of the science. -And good science is good observation.

135
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,179
Plus, it'll help to keep you sane for the next six years.

136
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,270
All right.

137
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,270
Whatever.

138
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,650
So, uh...

139
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Well, here I am...

140
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,989
doing science.

141
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,699
They're coming out!

142
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,160
Attention. Drivers coming out of link.

143
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh, God.

144
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,759
Where's the lab coat? Where's the lab coat?

145
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,050
Who's got my goddamn cigarette?

146
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
Guys!

147
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,300
What's wrong with this picture?

148
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,679
Thank you!

149
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,559
Grace Augustine is a legend.

150
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,309
She's the head of the Avatar Program. She wrote the book.

151
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,149
I mean, literally wrote the book on Pandoran botany.

152
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,649
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants better than people.

153
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,989
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

154
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,780
Grace, I'd like you to meet Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

155
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,950
Norm. I hear good things about you. How's your Na'vi?

156
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:12,750
May the All Mother... ...smile upon our first meeting.

157
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,050
Not bad. You sound a little formal.

158
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,420
I studied for five years...

159
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,720
...but there is much to learn.

160
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,139
Grace?

161
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,299
This is Jake Sully.

162
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,719
Ma'am.

163
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,219
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are, and I don't need you.

164
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,559
I need your brother.

165
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,649
You know, the PhD who trained for three years for this mission?

166
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,730
He's dead.

167
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,780
I know it's a big inconvenience for everyone.

168
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,989
How much lab training have you had?

169
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,820
I dissected a frog once.

170
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,029
You see? You see? I mean, they're just pissing on us

171
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,829
without even the courtesy of calling it rain.

172
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,749
-I'm going to Selfridge. -No, Grace,

173
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,369
-I don't think that's a good idea. -No, man, this is such bullshit!

174
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,999
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

175
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,840
He has no business sticking his nose in my department.

176
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,129
Here tomorrow, 0800.

177
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,800
Try and use big words.

178
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,099
-Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower. -You are cleared for south departure.

179
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,150
Hover taxi, Delta runway. Squawk ident.

180
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,819
Mmm!

181
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,029
-You see that? -Yes, sir.

182
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,910
No, you didn't. You were looking at the monitor.

183
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,660
I love this putter, Ronnie!

184
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,410
I love this putter.

185
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
Parker,

186
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,379
you know, I used to think it was benign neglect,

187
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,299
but now I see that you're intentionally screwing me.

188
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,090
Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.

189
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,720
Oops.

190
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,009
I need a researcher.

191
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,679
Not some jarhead dropout.

192
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,679
Well, actually, I thought we got lucky with him.

193
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,229
-Lucky? -Yeah.

194
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,149
How is this in any way lucky?

195
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,149
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

196
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,399
and lucky that brother wasn't some oral hygienist or something.

197
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,149
A Marine we can use.

198
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,109
I'm assigning him to your team as security escort.

199
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,699
The last thing I need is another trigger-happy moron out there.

200
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,699
Look, look, you're supposed to be winning the hearts and the minds of the natives.

201
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,659
Isn't that the whole point of your little puppet show?

202
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,289
If you look like them and you talk like them,

203
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,959
then they'll start trusting us.

204
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,129
We build them a school, we teach them English,

205
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,129
but after, what, how many years?

206
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,799
Relations with the indigenous are only getting worse.

207
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,510
Yeah, that tends to happen when you use machine guns on them.

208
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,800
Right. Come here.

209
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,850
I can't... I can't...

210
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,139
This is why we're here.

211
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,729
Unobtanium.

212
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,519
Because this little gray rock sells for 20 million a kilo.

213
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,149
That's the only reason.

214
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,779
It's what pays for the whole party.

215
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,859
It's what pays for your science.

216
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,199
Comprendo?

217
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,369
Now, those savages are threatening our whole operation,

218
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,659
we're on the brink of war,

219
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,039
and you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution.

220
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,250
So use what you've got, and get me some results.

221
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,009
So, how much link time have you logged?

222
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,269
-About 520 hours. -That's good.

223
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,390
You're in there.

224
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,559
You're here.

225
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,149
How much have you logged?

226
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,730
Zip. But I read a manual.

227
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,990
Tell me you're joking.

228
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,240
This is cool.

229
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,950
Let's go.

230
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,000
Don't. I got this.

231
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,629
So you just figured you'd come out here,

232
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,959
to the most hostile environment known to man,

233
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,339
with no training of any kind, and see how it went?

234
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,220
What was going through your head?

235
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,560
Maybe I was sick of doctors telling me what I couldn't do.

236
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,269
Biometrics are good.

237
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,519
Link three is ready.

238
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,560
Keep your arms in, hands in,

239
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,730
head down.

240
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,479
Down.

241
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,940
Just relax and let your mind go blank.

242
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,199
That shouldn't be hard for you.

243
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,529
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white...

244
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,830
Initiate link.

245
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,249
Run sequence unit three. Go.

246
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,370
Launching.

247
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,840
I have the first congruency.

248
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,719
That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.

249
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,309
Hmm. Go figure.

250
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,390
Phase-lock 40%.

251
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,900
All right. Going in.

252
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,280
I'm going in in four.

253
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,330
Phase-lock 99%. Link is stable.

254
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,799
He's in. Jake, can you hear me?

255
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,100
Can you hear me, Jake?

256
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,510
Pupillary reflex is good.

257
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,020
Pinna response normal. How you feeling, Jake?

258
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,940
Hey, guys.

259
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,360
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

260
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,229
Good!

261
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,939
Yeah, we're gonna take this nice and easy, Jake.

262
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,279
-And touch your thumb to your fingers. -Yeah.

263
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,739
-Thumb to your fingers. -No problem.

264
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,409
That's good. I can see you can remember that one.

265
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,489
Got it.

266
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,369
Well, if you want to sit up, that's fine.

267
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,249
Okay, good. Just take it nice and slow, Jake. Good.

268
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,079
Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

269
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,749
Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all?

270
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,539
You're wiggling your toes!

271
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,840
-Good. Good, Jake. -That's great.

272
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,299
Distal motor control is good. Good, Jake.

273
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,430
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

274
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,179
-That's great, Jake. -Whoa, whoa, whoa.

275
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,389
Hold on, now. Take it easy. Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

276
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,679
There's a few more sensory motor reflex tests

277
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,189
we need to run, so take it easy.

278
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,769
Ooh! Wait.

279
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,859
-Jake. -Sit down, Jake.

280
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,190
Jake! Listen to me.

281
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,189
-Whoa. -Jake!

282
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,609
I need you to sit down. Jake!

283
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:13,779
-It's okay. -Buddy, listen to me.

284
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,859
It's all good. I got this.

285
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,859
Jake, you need to sit down right now.

286
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,529
Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

287
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,619
Listen to me. For your own safety, you need to sit down.

288
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,659
You need time to adjust to the avatar... Whoa! Jake!

289
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,579
-God, Jake, watch your tail. -Yeah!

290
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,999
Sedate! Sedate him!

291
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,959
A thousand milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

292
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,549
Guys! Guys! Whoa! Whoa!

293
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,709
By the numbers.

294
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,129
-- Jake. Come on. -Jake! Listen to me.

295
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,589
You're not used to your avatar body.

296
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,549
-- This is dangerous. -This is great.

297
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,719
-Jake? -Come on.

298
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,140
-They're gonna put you out. -Jake, listen to me.

299
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,939
-Norm, sit down. -No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

300
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,809
Goddamn it! Bring them home!

301
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,109
Norm! Do not leave control!

302
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,400
You're not ready for it!

303
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,689
Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.

304
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:56,859
Oh! Oh! So close!

305
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,739
I don't even have to play defense on it.

306
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,409
-Hey, guys. Hey. -Whoa.

307
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,619
It's okay, I'll get him.

308
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,789
Jake, you have to come back!

309
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,750
Jake! Jake! Excuse me.

310
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,709
-Watch it! -Sorry!

311
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,830
Come on!

312
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,340
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

313
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,139
Jeez! Sorry.

314
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,310
Watch it!

315
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,580
Hey, Marine!

316
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,920
Damn.

317
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,000
Grace?

318
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,510
Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

319
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,680
Think fast.

320
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,590
Motor control's looking good.

321
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,019
Come on, everybody, quiet down!

322
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,480
All right, gang, lights out.

323
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,649
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

324
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,740
Hey, hey, hey!

325
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,869
Don't play with that. You'll go blind.

326
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,699
That's kind of freaky.

327
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,910
Come on. Scat.

328
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,330
Good night.

329
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,629
Lights out!

330
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,000
See you at dinner, kiddies.

331
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,490
Welcome back.

332
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,409
You okay? You all right?

333
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,540
Yeah, I'm okay.

334
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,459
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties.

335
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,210
And this here is my baby.

336
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,420
Hold on a second.

337
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,340
Hey, Wainfleet!

338
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,010
Get it done!

339
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,010
-We bounce at 0-9. -Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!

340
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,429
Vine strike's still loose.

341
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,679
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

342
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,850
Watch it!

343
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,189
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not the only thing

344
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,610
flying around out there. Or the biggest.

345
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,899
I'm gonna need you on a door gun.

346
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,189
I'm a man short.

347
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,570
I thought you'd never ask.

348
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,620
There's your man.

349
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,700
See you on the flight line.

350
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,630
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

351
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,050
This low gravity'll make you soft.

352
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,390
You get soft...

353
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,730
Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning.

354
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,560
I pulled your record, Corporal.

355
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,070
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

356
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,740
Nothing like this here, though.

357
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,320
You got some heart, kid, showing up in this neighborhood.

358
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,739
I figured it's just another hellhole.

359
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,700
I was First Recon myself.

360
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,790
A few years ahead of you. Well, maybe more than a few.

361
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,589
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

362
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,210
I come out here?

363
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,969
Day one. Think I felt like a shavetail louie? Yeah.

364
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,760
Oh, they could fix me up, if I rotated back.

365
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,060
And make me pretty again.

366
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,019
But you know what?

367
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,100
I kind of like it.

368
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,980
It reminds me every day what's waiting out there.

369
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,319
Hup!

370
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,899
The Avatar Program is a bad joke.

371
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,449
Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

372
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,909
However,

373
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:15,499
it does present an opportunity both timely and unique.

374
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,250
-Clear! -Clear!

375
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,799
A recon gyrene in an avatar body.

376
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,509
That's a potent mix.

377
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,129
Give me the goose bumps.

378
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,589
Such a Marine

379
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,060
could provide the intel I need, right on the ground.

380
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,180
Right in the hostiles' camp.

381
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,849
Look, Sully.

382
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,899
I want you to learn these savages from the inside.

383
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,399
I want you to gain their trust.

384
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,529
I need to know how to force their cooperation

385
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,780
or hammer them hard if they won't.

386
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,409
-Am I still with Augustine? -On paper.

387
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,539
Yeah, you walk like one of her science pukes,

388
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,080
you quack like one,

389
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,790
but you report to me.

390
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,700
Can you do that for me, son?

391
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,510
Hell, yeah, sir.

392
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,340
Well, all right, then.

393
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,859
Son, I take care of my own.

394
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,149
You get me what I need,

395
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,190
I'll see to it you get your legs back when you rotate home.

396
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,780
Your real legs.

397
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,950
That sounds real good, sir.

398
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,629
Link's ready!

399
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,040
Phase-lock 40%.

400
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,589
Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking.

401
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,089
I have five congruencies.

402
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,590
Phase-lock 90%.

403
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,470
Link three ready.

404
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,800
All right, I'm going in.

405
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,390
Whoo!

406
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,170
Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.

407
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,049
Norm!

408
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,299
Your pack.

409
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,510
Pack.

410
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,140
Stay with the ship.

411
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,720
One idiot with a gun is enough.

412
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,940
You the man, Doc.

413
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,140
Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.

414
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,060
Relax, Marine.

415
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,150
You're making me nervous.

416
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,319
So, how will they know we're here?

417
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,450
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

418
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,580
-Keep moving, Norm. -Keep up, guys!

419
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,209
And here I go.

420
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,630
Scanning.

421
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,880
Oh, wow! It's that fast?

422
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,219
-Amazing, isn't it? -Yeah.

423
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,389
So, that is signal transduction

424
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:49,139
from this root to the root of the tree next to it.

425
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,019
So, we should take a sample.

426
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,190
Okay. Sample.

427
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,820
You know, it's probably electrical, based on the speed of the reaction.

428
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:03,120
Norm, you've contaminated the sample with your saliva.

429
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,120
Right.

430
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,520
So, here I go.

431
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,469
Don't shoot.

432
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,680
Don't shoot. You'll piss him off.

433
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,429
It's already pissed off.

434
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,139
Jake, that armor's too thick.

435
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,230
Trust me.

436
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,569
It's a territorial threat display.

437
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,900
Do not run, or he'll charge.

438
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,819
So, what do I do, dance with it?

439
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,660
Just hold your ground.

440
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,640
Yeah? Come on! What you got?

441
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,850
Oh, yeah. Who's bad? That's right.

442
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,600
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.

443
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,059
That's right, get your punk ass back to Mommy.

444
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,229
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing. You keep running.

445
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,630
Yeah, and why don't you bring back some of your friends, huh?

446
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,320
Oh, shit.

447
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,670
So what about this one? Run? Don't run? What?

448
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,300
Run! Definitely run!

449
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,399
I'm gonna have to call it, guys.

450
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,739
We're not allowed to run night ops.

451
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,320
Colonel's orders.

452
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,620
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have to hang on till morning.

453
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,950
He won't make it till morning.

454
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,490
I don't have all goddamn night.

455
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,070
Come on! Come on!

456
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,480
Hey, wait. Don't!

457
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,570
Great.

458
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,879
Look, I know you probably don't understand this...

459
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,880
...but, uh...

460
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:48,970
...thank you.

461
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,230
Thank you.

462
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,190
That was pretty impressive.

463
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,900
I would have been screwed if you hadn't come along. It was...

464
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,450
Hey, wait a second.

465
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,160
Hey, where you going?

466
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,620
Wait up!

467
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,000
Just... Hey, slow down.

468
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,339
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say thanks for killing those things.

469
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,590
Damn!

470
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,920
Don't thank.

471
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,180
You don't thank for this.

472
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,140
This is sad.

473
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,640
Very sad only.

474
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,350
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

475
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,190
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

476
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,150
All this is your fault. They did not need to die.

477
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,699
My fault? They attacked me. How am I the bad guy?

478
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,949
-Your fault! -Ay! Whoa!

479
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,199
Your fault!

480
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,869
Shh. Easy. Easy.

481
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,199
You're like a baby.

482
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,120
Making noise, don't know what to do.

483
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,290
Easy. Shh.

484
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,290
Fine.

485
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:04,380
Fine.

486
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,970
If you love your little forest friends,

487
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,390
why not let them just kill my ass?

488
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,640
What's the thinking?

489
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,219
-Why save you? -Yeah.

490
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,480
Yeah, why save me?

491
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,770
You have a strong heart.

492
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
No fear.

493
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,239
But stupid!

494
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,080
Ignorant like a child.

495
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,790
Well, if I'm like a child, then, uh...

496
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,549
Look, maybe you should teach me.

497
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,299
Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.

498
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,799
Well, then teach me how to See.

499
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,589
No one can teach you to See.

500
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,680
Whoa.

501
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,390
Look, come on, can't we talk?

502
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,269
Say, where'd you learn to speak English?

503
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,020
Dr. Augustine's school?

504
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,940
Whoa. Little help.

505
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,650
You're like a baby.

506
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,080
I need your help.

507
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,040
You should not be here.

508
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,499
-Okay, take me with you. -No!

509
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,580
Go back.

510
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,250
No.

511
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,710
Go back.

512
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,450
No!

513
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,800
What...

514
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,100
What are they?

515
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,560
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

516
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,690
Very pure spirits.

517
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,070
Uh-huh.

518
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,840
What was that all about?

519
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,720
Come.

520
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,680
Come!

521
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,100
Where are we going?

522
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,360
Come.

523
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,070
What's your name?

524
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,780
Shit!

525
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,360
Calm, people. Calm.

526
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,950
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

527
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:07,370
These demons are forbidden here.

528
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,290
There has been a sign.

529
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,790
This is a matter for the Tsahik.

530
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,670
Bring him.

531
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,050
What's going on?

532
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,180
Wait.

533
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,060
What's happening?

534
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,770
Hey!

535
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,130
Father...

536
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:45,800
...I see you.

537
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:02,360
This creature... why do you bring him here?

538
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,160
I was going to kill him...

539
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,280
...but there was a sign from Eywa.

540
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:11,450
I have said... no dreamwalker will come here.

541
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,000
What's he saying?

542
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,000
His alien smell fills my nose.

543
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,499
-Hey, what's he saying? -My father is deciding

544
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,750
whether to kill you.

545
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,550
Your father.

546
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:24,750
It's nice to meet you, sir.

547
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,600
Step back!

548
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,730
I will look at this alien.

549
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:38,149
That is Mother. She is Tsahik.

550
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:41,229
The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

551
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,320
Who's Eywa?

552
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,080
What are you called?

553
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,620
Jake Sully.

554
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,760
Why did you come to us?

555
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:06,680
I came to learn.

556
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,679
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

557
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,350
It is hard to fill a cup which is already full.

558
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,060
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

559
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,359
Just ask Dr. Augustine. I'm no scientist.

560
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,900
What are you?

561
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:26,780
I was a Marine.

562
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,490
A, uh... A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

563
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,000
A warrior!

564
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,580
I could kill him easily!

565
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,040
No!

566
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,590
This is the first warrior dreamwalker...

567
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,550
...we have seen.

568
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,590
We need to learn more about him.

569
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:55,180
My Daughter... you will teach him our way...

570
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:58,600
...to speak and walk as we do.

571
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:02,400
Why me? That's not fair...

572
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,320
It is decided.

573
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,239
My daughter will teach you our ways.

574
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,990
Learn well, Jakesully.

575
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,870
Then we will see if your insanity can be cured.

576
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,310
Good... Good evening.

577
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,230
Please don't get up.

578
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,440
Excuse me.

579
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,690
Sorry.

580
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,570
Hey, how you doing?

581
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,119
Jake. Jake!

582
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,700
-He's coming out right now. -Jake.

583
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:41,330
Jake!

584
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,750
Come on back, kid. Come on. That's it.

585
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:50,379
There you go. There you go, there you go.

586
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,719
You're okay. You're okay.

587
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,550
Damn! You were dug in like a tick.

588
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:00,559
Is the avatar safe?

589
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,519
Yeah, Doc.

590
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,770
And you are not gonna believe where I am.

591
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:10,729
The last thing we see is this Marine's ass disappearing into the brush

592
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:13,359
with this angry thanator coming after him.

593
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,989
Hey, it's not something you can teach.

594
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:16,569
That is awesome.

595
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:19,029
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

596
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,039
the Omaticaya have chosen you.

597
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,120
God help us all.

598
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,749
-"Jarhead clan?" -Mmm-hmm.

599
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,710
And it worked?

600
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,050
Hey, I'm practically family.

601
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,049
They're gonna study me.

602
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,299
I have to learn to be one of them.

603
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,839
That's called taking the initiative, son.

604
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,339
I wish I had ten more like you.

605
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,509
Look, Sully. Sully.

606
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:42,180
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

607
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:48,649
You know, I mean, we try to give them medicine, education, uh, roads.

608
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,479
But no, no, no, they like mud.

609
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,650
And that wouldn't bother me, it's just that they're, uh...

610
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,370
Hey, can you... Can somebody just... Sector 12.

611
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:03,289
Okay, go, go, go, stop. Stop...

612
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:04,870
Rich, stop! That's... Jesus.

613
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,959
Their damn village happens to be resting

614
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:14,379
on the richest unobtanium deposit within 200 klicks in any direction.

615
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,680
I mean, look at all that cheddar!

616
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,179
Well, who gets them to move?

617
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,810
Guess.

618
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,099
What if they won't go?

619
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,099
Oh, I'm betting that they will.

620
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,690
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. Look. Look.

621
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:34,650
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

622
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:39,449
but there's one thing that shareholders hate more than bad press,

623
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:41,199
and that's a bad quarterly statement.

624
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,659
I didn't make up the rules.

625
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,830
So just find me a carrot that'll get them to move,

626
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,540
otherwise it's gonna have to be all stick. Okay?

627
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,749
You got three months.

628
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,879
That's when the 'dozers get there.

629
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,420
Well, we're wasting time.

630
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,339
I like this guy.

631
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:01,140
Guys, right now... Okay, let's run through them again.

632
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,430
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

633
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:08,309
-Eytucan. -Eytukan.

634
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:09,389
He's the clan leader.

635
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:11,309
But she's the spiritual leader.

636
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:13,190
-Like a shaman. -Got it.

637
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,359
T'su'tey.

638
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,439
Tsu'tey.

639
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,529
Tsu'tey.

640
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,200
He'll be the next clan leader.

641
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,319
Neytiri.

642
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,779
She'll be the next Tsahik.

643
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,200
They become a mated pair.

644
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:27,830
So who's this Eywa?

645
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:29,290
"Who's Eywa?"

646
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,080
Only their deity.

647
00:51:31,081 --> 00:51:33,749
Their goddess, made up of all living things.

648
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,089
Everything they know!

649
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,379
You'd know this if you had any training whatsoever.

650
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,839
Who's got a date with the chief's daughter?

651
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,509
-Oh, come on. That's not... -All right, knock it off, you two.

652
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:42,760
Let's go. Village life starts early.

653
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:47,770
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

654
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,200
Easy, boy.

655
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:10,500
Pale is female.

656
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:14,840
Okay.

657
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,460
Easy, girl.

658
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,990
That is shahaylu.

659
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,990
The bond.

660
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:52,410
Feel her.

661
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,960
Feel her heartbeat.

662
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,380
Her breath.

663
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,380
Feel her strong legs.

664
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,350
You may tell her what to do.

665
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,270
Inside.

666
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,270
For now,

667
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,440
say where to go.

668
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:18,770
Forward!

669
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,330
You should go away.

670
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:39,420
No, you'd miss me.

671
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,170
I knew you could speak English.

672
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:47,720
This alien will learn nothing...

673
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,810
...A rock sees more...

674
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,100
...look at him.

675
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:02,399
Again.

676
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,280
If you want to hit this thing, it's gonna be complicated.

677
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,949
Your scan doesn't show the internal structure.

678
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,819
There's an outer row of columns.

679
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,829
-Uh-huh. -Real heavy duty.

680
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:14,699
There's a secondary ring here, and an inner ring.

681
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,120
There's a core structure like a spiral.

682
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,629
That's how they move up and down.

683
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:22,339
We're gonna need accurate scans on every column.

684
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,669
-Roger that. -Mmm.

685
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:26,379
What else can you tell us about the structure?

686
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,260
I'm guessing this secondary ring,

687
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,890
that's also load-bearing.

688
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,270
So where are we going?

689
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,770
Getting out of Dodge.

690
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,059
I'm not about to let Selfridge and Quaritch

691
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,690
micro-manage this thing.

692
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:46,529
There's a mobile link up at Site 26 we can work out of,

693
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:47,900
way up in the mountains.

694
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,950
The Hallelujah Mountains?

695
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,620
That's right.

696
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:53,949
Are you serious?

697
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:55,039
Yeah.

698
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,250
Yes!

699
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,999
The legendary floating mountains of Pandora.

700
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,300
Heard of them?

701
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,850
We're getting close.

702
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,350
Yeah, look at my instruments.

703
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,730
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

704
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:26,649
We're VFR from here on.

705
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:27,900
What's VFR?

706
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,530
Means you gotta see where you're going.

707
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,659
You can't see anything.

708
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,160
Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

709
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,560
Oh, my God.

710
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,740
You should see your faces.

711
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,850
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

712
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,990
Welcome to camp.

713
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,210
So...

714
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:05,499
this is my bunk.

715
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,000
This stuff is nasty.

716
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:10,129
-Norm, go under. -All right.

717
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,339
Grace didn't miss a thing.

718
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,580
Trudy, you'll take the top one.

719
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,510
She knew I was talking to the Colonel.

720
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:19,350
But I had what she needed, a way back in with the clan,

721
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,469
so she's playing nice.

722
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:25,269
All right. Jake, hang a left.

723
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:26,980
You'll be in the link at the end.

724
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,780
Unit one. Beulah.

725
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,860
She's the least glitchy.

726
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,869
Holy shit!

727
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,540
Do not look in her eye.

728
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,710
Seyzey.

729
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:37,430
Ikran is not horse.

730
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:40,470
Once shahaylu is made...

731
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:48,350
...ikran will fly with only one hunter in the whole life.

732
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:01,279
To become taronyu, hunter,

733
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,040
you must choose your own ikran and he must choose you.

734
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,420
-When? -When you are ready.

735
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:00,880
Okay.

736
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:03,300
This is video log 12.

737
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,010
Time's 2132.

738
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:08,729
Do I have to do this now?

739
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,769
I... I really need to get some rack.

740
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:12,150
No, now.

741
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:13,940
When it's fresh.

742
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:18,110
Okay, location, shack,

743
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:20,950
and the days are starting to blur together.

744
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,369
The language is a pain, but,

745
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:28,409
you know, I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon.

746
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:30,119
Just repetition, repetition.

747
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,789
-- Navi. -"Nari."

748
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,879
-- Nari. -"Narrri"!

749
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,590
Narrri!

750
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:38,460
Txur nì'ul. Stronger.

751
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:45,139
Neytiri calls me skxawng.

752
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,800
It means moron.

753
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:50,479
This is a very important part of it.

754
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,809
Norm's attitude has improved lately.

755
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:52,889
I see you.

756
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:55,189
But it's not just, "I'm seeing you in front of me,"

757
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,729
it's "I see into you. I See you."

758
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:59,859
It's good he's back on board, but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.

759
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:02,029
"I understand you." So you gotta get this, okay?

760
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:04,279
I gotta run! Okay?

761
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,370
Let's go.

762
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,490
My feet are getting tougher.

763
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,740
I can run farther every day.

764
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,620
I have to trust my body to know what to do.

765
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,170
Yeah! Check it out!

766
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:23,130
Oh, crap!

767
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:32,679
Every day, it's reading the trails, the tracks at the waterhole,

768
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,020
the tiniest scents and sounds.

769
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,939
She's always going on about the flow of energy,

770
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:45,280
the spirits of animals.

771
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:48,739
I really hope this tree-hugger crap isn't on the final.

772
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:49,949
This isn't just about

773
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:52,539
eye-hand coordination out there, you know.

774
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:55,159
You need to listen to what she says.

775
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:58,419
Try to see the forest through her eyes.

776
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,880
Excuse me. This is my video log here.

777
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:19,230
With Neytiri, it's learn fast or die.

778
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:21,860
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

779
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,770
I talked Mo'at into letting Grace into the village.

780
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:54,940
Look how big you are.

781
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,600
It's the first time since her school was closed down.

782
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,440
You are so pretty.

783
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, you don't. Come back here.

784
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,740
Bon appétit.

785
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,430
Come on, Marine.

786
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,789
I'm trying to understand this deep connection

787
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,550
the people have to the forest.

788
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:10,089
She talks about a network of energy

789
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:12,840
that flows through all living things.

790
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:17,100
-- she says... -...all energy is only borrowed,

791
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,520
and one day you have to give it back.

792
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:45,880
I see you... Brother

793
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,590
...and thank you.

794
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,550
Your Spirit goes with Eywa.

795
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,890
Your body stays behind...

796
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,890
...to become part of The People.

797
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,850
A clean kill.

798
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:09,360
You are ready.

799
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:38,300
Learning to ride an ikran, we call them banshees,

800
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:40,970
is the test every young hunter has to pass.

801
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:47,150
But to do that, you gotta go where the banshees are.

802
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,520
Oo-rah.

803
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,640
Now what?

804
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:53,520
Jakesully will go first.

805
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:28,390
Now you choose your ikran.

806
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,980
This you must feel inside.

807
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,020
If he also chooses you, move quick like I showed.

808
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,230
You will have one chance, Jake.

809
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:39,150
How will I know if he chooses me?

810
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:41,070
He will try to kill you.

811
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,410
Outstanding.

812
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:45,680
Let's dance.

813
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,140
That moron's going to die.

814
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,450
Don't be afraid, warrior.

815
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:21,170
Make the bond!

816
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,760
No!

817
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,970
Jake!

818
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:46,530
Shahaylu, Jake.

819
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:50,160
Shahaylu!

820
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,250
Stop!

821
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:12,180
That's right.

822
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,060
You're mine.

823
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:29,609
First flight seals the bond.

824
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:31,160
You cannot wait.

825
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:35,200
-Think, "Fly!" -Fly?

826
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,630
God damn!

827
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:49,970
Oh, shit!

828
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:01,600
Oh, shut up and fly straight!

829
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,660
That's it. Bank left!

830
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,840
Level out! That's it.

831
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,300
Whoo! Jakesully!

832
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,080
Hey!

833
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:05,460
Let's go!

834
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:19,720
Yeah, baby, I got this!

835
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:22,020
Oh, shit!

836
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,529
I may not be much of a horse guy,

837
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:30,819
but I was born to do this.

838
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:32,780
Yeah!

839
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:36,989
-I came like this. This you. -Yeah, yeah.

840
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:40,239
I turn. I feel the wind. I turn very strong.

841
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,370
Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard...

842
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:46,390
The Tree of Souls.

843
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,020
It's their most sacred place.

844
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:55,569
See the Flux Vortex in these false color images?

845
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:57,739
Yeah, that's what messes up my instruments.

846
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:02,580
There is something really interesting going on in there biologically.

847
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,410
I would die to get samples.

848
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:08,250
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

849
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,920
You lucky swine.

850
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:20,639
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter.

851
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:21,930
Death from above.

852
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,180
Only problem is,

853
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:26,060
you're not the only one.

854
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:30,850
Dive!

855
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:54,800
Go, go!

856
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:04,260
Follow me!

857
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:11,400
Whew.

858
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:53,230
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

859
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,059
It is Toruk.

860
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:57,690
Last Shadow.

861
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:00,240
Yeah, right.

862
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:02,530
It's the last one you ever see.

863
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:10,580
My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk Macto.

864
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:13,540
Rider of Last Shadow.

865
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:15,790
He rode this?

866
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:18,960
Toruk chose him.

867
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:23,629
It has only happened five times since the time of the First Songs.

868
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:25,840
-That's a long time. -Yes.

869
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,510
Toruk Macto was mighty.

870
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,890
He brought the clans together in a time of great sorrow.

871
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:36,440
All Na'vi people know the story.

872
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,740
Everything is backwards now.

873
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:47,410
Like out there is the true world

874
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,580
and in here is the dream.

875
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:12,930
It's hard to believe it's only been three months.

876
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:18,440
I can barely remember my old life.

877
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:24,190
I don't know who I am anymore.

878
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:45,380
Haven't gotten lost in the woods, have you?

879
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:51,720
Your last report was more than two weeks ago.

880
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:56,270
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

881
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,939
The way I see it, it's time to terminate the mission.

882
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:03,230
No, I can do this.

883
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:05,530
You already have.

884
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:08,779
You give me good, usable intel.

885
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:10,780
Oh, this Tree of Souls place.

886
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:13,449
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that

887
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:16,870
when this turns into a shit fight, which it will. Yeah.

888
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,710
Now it's time to come in.

889
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:22,670
-By the way... -Mmm-hmm?

890
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,090
...you gonna get your legs back.

891
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:28,629
Yeah. I got your corporate approval.

892
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:29,969
It's a done deal.

893
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:31,970
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

894
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:33,970
I'm a man of my word.

895
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:38,520
I gotta finish this.

896
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:42,520
There's one more thing.

897
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:44,610
Ceremony.

898
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:48,530
It's, uh... It's the final stage of becoming a man.

899
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:52,530
If I do it, I'm one of them.

900
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:56,290
And they'll trust me.

901
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,500
And I can negotiate the terms of their relocation.

902
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:19,100
Well, then, you'd better get it done, Corporal.

903
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:40,620
The Na'vi say that every person is born twice.

904
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:44,000
The second time

905
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,800
is when you earn your place among The People

906
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:48,460
forever.

907
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:58,180
You are now a son of the Omaticaya.

908
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:02,560
You are part of The People.

909
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:49,820
Come.

910
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,360
Come.

911
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:11,250
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

912
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,550
And sometimes answered.

913
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,600
We call these trees Utraya Mokri.

914
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:28,060
The Tree of Voices.

915
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:32,230
The voices of our ancestors.

916
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:48,500
I can hear them.

917
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:54,880
They live, Jake...

918
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:59,260
within Eywa.

919
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:04,930
You are Omaticaya now.

920
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,480
You may make your bow from the wood of Hometree.

921
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:15,900
And you may choose a woman.

922
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:20,280
We have many fine women.

923
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,740
Ninat is the best singer.

924
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:28,420
But I don't want Ninat.

925
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:34,840
Beyral is a good hunter.

926
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:38,050
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

927
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:42,470
I've already chosen.

928
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:47,930
But this woman must also choose me.

929
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:53,940
She already has.

930
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:26,600
I am with you now, Jake.

931
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:30,140
We are mated for life.

932
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,150
What the hell are you doing, Jake?

933
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:09,850
Ma Jake!

934
01:25:09,851 --> 01:25:11,349
Don't forget your phase integration.

935
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:12,769
-Jake! -No, no, the middle button.

936
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:15,020
-You gotta eat something. -Yeah, there you go.

937
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,070
Jake! Jake.

938
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:27,950
Wake up! Jake, please!

939
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:30,500
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

940
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:33,750
Grace, I don't want... Hey!

941
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,920
Jake!

942
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:49,010
Okay.

943
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:02,069
Here. I'm done. Let's go.

944
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:04,399
And when was the last time you took a shower?

945
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,360
-I don't need a shower. -Jesus, Marine.

946
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,740
Jake!

947
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:21,209
Jake! Wake up!

948
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:23,420
Jake! Wake up!

949
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:28,600
Hey!

950
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:31,849
Stop! Stop!

951
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:34,100
-Jake! -Go back! Stop!

952
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:39,730
Hey, boss.

953
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:41,730
Hey!

954
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,399
-What? -I got a native

955
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,449
doing the funky chicken here. He's blocking my blade.

956
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:51,199
Well, keep going. He'll move.

957
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,579
These people have to learn that we don't stop.

958
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:54,870
Come on, go, go, go.

959
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,169
Hey!

960
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,539
Stop! Hey!

961
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:01,590
Go! Go!

962
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,670
There, see? He moved.

963
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:16,639
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

964
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,349
Dude, dude. Whoa, dude! Dude, no!

965
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:20,060
Oh! I'm blind.

966
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:34,620
-Jake! -Neytiri!

967
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:37,330
Here, come on!

968
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:05,400
Freeze it right there.

969
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:08,319
Scale up.

970
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,610
Enhance.

971
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:12,530
Son of a bitch.

972
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,700
Unbelievable.

973
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:18,830
-Get me a pilot. -Yes, sir.

974
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:27,880
Tsu'tey will lead the war party.

975
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:35,760
Stop, please!

976
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:39,390
This will only make it worse.

977
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,350
You do not speak here!

978
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,150
We will strike them in the heart.

979
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:53,870
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

980
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:58,660
-You! -Listen. Brother...

981
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:05,999
You mated with this woman?

982
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,340
Oh, shit.

983
01:29:08,630 --> 01:29:10,720
Is this true?

984
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,839
We are mated before Eywa.

985
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,429
It is done.

986
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:17,509
Brother, please.

987
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:20,099
Do not attack the Sky People.

988
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:21,809
Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

989
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:23,770
You are not my brother!

990
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:29,150
And I am not your enemy!

991
01:29:30,650 --> 01:29:33,950
The enemy is out there, and they are very powerful!

992
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,660
Go! Go! Go!

993
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:43,369
-I can talk to them. -No more talk.

994
01:29:43,370 --> 01:29:44,710
Tsu'tey!

995
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:53,840
I am Omaticaya. I am one of you.

996
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,390
And I have the right to speak.

997
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:03,480
I have something to say...

998
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:07,310
...to all of you.

999
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,250
The words are like stones in my heart.

1000
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:21,910
Sir, I'm sorry. No, no, no! Hold on! You can't interrupt a link in progress!

1001
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,620
It's very dangerous!

1002
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:28,420
Grace!

1003
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:30,919
Oh, no.

1004
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:32,550
-Wait! -Stay down, sir.

1005
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:36,800
Okay. Look...

1006
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,350
I was sent here to...

1007
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:44,230
You see?

1008
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:46,850
It is a demon in a false body.

1009
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:08,119
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

1010
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:09,750
You crossed the line.

1011
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:15,300
Wheel this meat out of here.

1012
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:20,220
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

1013
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:25,310
You let me down, son.

1014
01:31:27,310 --> 01:31:28,520
So, what, you...

1015
01:31:29,810 --> 01:31:31,769
you find yourself some local tail

1016
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:34,819
and you just completely forget what team you're playing for?

1017
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:37,699
Parker, there is time to salvage the situation.

1018
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:39,740
-Parker... -Shut your pie hole!

1019
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:42,909
Or what, Ranger Rick?

1020
01:31:42,910 --> 01:31:44,579
You gonna shoot me?

1021
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:46,329
I could do that.

1022
01:31:46,330 --> 01:31:47,409
You need to muzzle your dog.

1023
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:50,079
Yeah, can we just take this down a couple of notches, please?

1024
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,000
You say you want to keep your people alive?

1025
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:54,300
You start by listening to her.

1026
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,299
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya

1027
01:31:57,300 --> 01:31:59,129
-in a way you can't imagine. -You know what?

1028
01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:04,559
You throw a stick in the air around here, it's gonna land on some sacred fern...

1029
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:05,769
...for Christ's sake!

1030
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:08,979
I'm not talking about some kind of pagan voodoo here.

1031
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:10,519
I'm talking about something real,

1032
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:13,269
something measurable in the biology of the forest.

1033
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:14,610
Which is what, exactly?

1034
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:17,149
What we think we know

1035
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:20,609
is that there is some kind of electrochemical communication

1036
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:22,779
between the roots of the trees,

1037
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:24,779
like the synapses between neurons.

1038
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:28,659
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth connections

1039
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:32,750
to the trees around it. And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees on Pandora.

1040
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,840
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

1041
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:38,710
It's more connections than the human brain.

1042
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:40,929
Get it?

1043
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:42,389
It's a network.

1044
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:45,509
It's a global network, and the Na'vi can access it.

1045
01:32:45,510 --> 01:32:47,929
They can upload and download data.

1046
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:49,059
Memories.

1047
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:51,979
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

1048
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:53,230
Yes!

1049
01:32:54,690 --> 01:32:58,150
What the hell have you people been smoking out there?

1050
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:01,610
They're just goddamn trees!

1051
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:06,029
-You need to wake up, Parker. -No. You need to wake up.

1052
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:08,949
The wealth of this world isn't in the ground.

1053
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:10,619
It's all around us.

1054
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:14,379
The Na'vi know that, and they are fighting to defend it.

1055
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,839
If you want to share this world with them,

1056
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,250
you need to understand them.

1057
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:23,550
I'd say we understand them just fine, thanks to Jake here.

1058
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:27,220
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

1059
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:29,470
They're not gonna give up their home.

1060
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:33,140
They're not gonna make a deal.

1061
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:36,440
For what? lite beer?

1062
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:39,070
And blue jeans?

1063
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,570
There's nothing that we have that they want.

1064
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:49,620
Everything they sent me out here to do is a waste of time.

1065
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,630
They're never gonna leave Hometree.

1066
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:05,429
So, since a deal can't be made, I guess things get real simple.

1067
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:07,720
Jake, thanks.

1068
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:10,059
I'm getting all emotional.

1069
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:12,100
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

1070
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:22,780
I'll do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous.

1071
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:25,990
I'll drive them out with gas first.

1072
01:34:27,570 --> 01:34:28,910
It'll be humane.

1073
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:31,700
More or less.

1074
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,540
All right, let's pull the trigger.

1075
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:41,459
-Come on, people. -Oh, man.

1076
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:43,010
Let's pack it up, let's go.

1077
01:34:43,630 --> 01:34:44,880
This is how it's done.

1078
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:51,429
When people are sitting on shit that you want,

1079
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:52,770
you make them your enemy.

1080
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,060
Then you're justified in taking it.

1081
01:34:55,730 --> 01:34:57,559
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.

1082
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:58,730
He's gonna hit Hometree.

1083
01:34:59,310 --> 01:35:00,310
My God.

1084
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:09,739
Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!

1085
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:10,869
Back off!

1086
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:13,039
Parker. Wait. Stop.

1087
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,579
These are people you're about to...

1088
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:15,709
-No. No, no, no, no. -I said back off!

1089
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:19,249
They're fly-bitten savages that live in a tree!

1090
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:20,540
All right? Look around!

1091
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,169
I don't know about you, but I see a lot of trees!

1092
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:24,260
They can move!

1093
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:26,129
-Can you guys just please... -Yes, sir.

1094
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:27,469
There are families in there.

1095
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:28,969
There are children. Babies.

1096
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:30,339
Are you gonna kill children?

1097
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:32,220
You don't want that kind of blood on your hands.

1098
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,640
Believe me.

1099
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:36,680
Just let me try to talk them out.

1100
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:38,810
They trust me.

1101
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:44,819
Calibrate fast. We're going in, right now.

1102
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:46,989
Calibrating three and four.

1103
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:48,069
Run sequence.

1104
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:49,860
Initiating. Thirty seconds.

1105
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:55,999
Listen to me. You've got one hour.

1106
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,579
Unless you want your girlfriend in there when the ax comes down,

1107
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:00,249
you get them to evacuate.

1108
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:01,380
One hour.

1109
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:08,510
Father!

1110
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:09,760
Mother!

1111
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,890
Eytukan, I have something to say.

1112
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:14,510
Listen!

1113
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,100
Speak, Jakesully.

1114
01:36:18,430 --> 01:36:21,350
A great evil is upon us...

1115
01:36:21,730 --> 01:36:23,610
The Sky People are coming...

1116
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:26,360
...to destroy Home tree.

1117
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:30,320
Look, tell them they're gonna be here soon.

1118
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:35,449
You have to leave, or you're gonna die.

1119
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:37,290
Are you certain of this?

1120
01:36:41,210 --> 01:36:42,210
Look, they sent me here

1121
01:36:43,790 --> 01:36:45,130
to learn your ways

1122
01:36:46,090 --> 01:36:49,630
so one day I could bring this message and that you would believe it.

1123
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:53,430
What are you saying, Jake?

1124
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:55,550
You knew this would happen?

1125
01:36:58,890 --> 01:37:00,019
Yes.

1126
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:02,810
Look, at first it was just orders,

1127
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,649
and then everything changed.

1128
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:08,070
Okay? I fell in love.

1129
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:12,279
I fell in love with the... with the forest

1130
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,660
and with the Omaticaya people.

1131
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:16,700
And with you.

1132
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,039
-I trusted you. -With you. With you.

1133
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:21,539
I trusted you!

1134
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:22,960
Trust me now, please.

1135
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:32,759
You will never be one of The People!

1136
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,639
-I shouldn't have... -We tried to stop them!

1137
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,720
Neytiri, please! Please.

1138
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:42,770
Bind them.

1139
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:45,560
Leave now!

1140
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:48,570
You have to go. They're coming!

1141
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,119
Time on target, one mike.

1142
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:06,500
Copy. We have a visual.

1143
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:10,209
Roger that. Stay on heading 030.

1144
01:38:10,210 --> 01:38:11,800
Roger, 030.

1145
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,650
-Run to the forest! -They're coming!

1146
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:30,359
They will destroy this place.

1147
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,650
Neytiri, you must go now!

1148
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:39,070
Run to the forest! Run!

1149
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:42,700
Run!

1150
01:38:42,830 --> 01:38:46,500
Have no fear.

1151
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:06,560
No! God damn it, run!

1152
01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:10,360
Take the ikran... ...attack from above.

1153
01:39:14,650 --> 01:39:16,740
That is one big damn tree.

1154
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,620
Well, well, well.

1155
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:28,500
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

1156
01:39:30,170 --> 01:39:32,589
All right, people, let's get this done!

1157
01:39:32,590 --> 01:39:35,419
I want every gas round you got right in the front door.

1158
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:37,050
Roger. CS-40s, going hot.

1159
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:39,130
-Fire. -Firing.

1160
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,860
Bingo. Mighty good shooting, ace.

1161
01:40:00,610 --> 01:40:02,280
Sir, they've opened fire.

1162
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:05,620
You've got to be kidding me!

1163
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:20,719
These dumb bastards ain't getting the message.

1164
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,759
All right, let's turn up the heat.

1165
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,099
Switch incendiaries!

1166
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:25,679
Switching incendiaries.

1167
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:26,770
Fire.

1168
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:31,400
No!

1169
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:46,240
Get everyone to the forest.

1170
01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:51,790
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

1171
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:56,500
Neytiri!

1172
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:07,850
We gotta move! He's gonna blow the columns!

1173
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:09,890
My God!

1174
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:30,079
Mo'at! No!

1175
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:32,040
If you are one of us,

1176
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:34,540
help us.

1177
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:44,299
All call signs, switch missiles.

1178
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:47,100
Give me HEs at the base of the west columns.

1179
01:41:48,890 --> 01:41:50,020
This way!

1180
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,309
Rider section, switch missiles.

1181
01:41:53,310 --> 01:41:55,269
-One's good. -Two's rocks up.

1182
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:57,900
-Three's up. -Yeah, baby, get some!

1183
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,779
Charlie Oscar, Gunrunner standing by.

1184
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:02,320
-Bring it down. -Cleared hot.

1185
01:42:09,330 --> 01:42:10,740
Come on, Grace, move!

1186
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:14,540
Down! Head down!

1187
01:42:17,790 --> 01:42:19,630
Come on, come on! Down!

1188
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:25,470
Solid hits.

1189
01:42:25,471 --> 01:42:26,549
Solid rocks on target.

1190
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:27,640
Screw this.

1191
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:31,059
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1192
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:33,480
I didn't sign up for this shit!

1193
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:44,780
Repeat. Ripple fire.

1194
01:43:28,530 --> 01:43:29,820
Go! Go! Go!

1195
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:05,440
No, no, get back! Back!

1196
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:26,880
Come on, move! Move!

1197
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,140
That's good work, people.

1198
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:15,550
First round's on me tonight.

1199
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:17,180
Let's boogie.

1200
01:45:17,850 --> 01:45:20,429
Dragon coming left, heading home.

1201
01:45:20,430 --> 01:45:22,060
Gunrunner coming left.

1202
01:45:22,690 --> 01:45:23,690
Thunder copies.

1203
01:45:23,691 --> 01:45:25,020
Rider section copies.

1204
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:33,990
Father!

1205
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:51,090
Daughter...

1206
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:55,470
take... my... bow.

1207
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:04,060
Protect The People.

1208
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:13,700
Neytiri!

1209
01:46:23,620 --> 01:46:25,499
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1210
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,460
Get away.

1211
01:46:28,130 --> 01:46:29,420
Get away!

1212
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:32,010
Get away from here!

1213
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:35,050
Never come back!

1214
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:54,030
Pull the plug.

1215
01:46:54,650 --> 01:46:57,699
-No, you can't do that! -You can't do that!

1216
01:46:57,700 --> 01:46:59,780
-Calm down! Calm down! -No! Please!

1217
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:18,220
I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace.

1218
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:21,300
Sooner or later, though,

1219
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:23,810
you always have to wake up.

1220
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:27,850
Let's go!

1221
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:37,700
Put him down!

1222
01:47:40,870 --> 01:47:43,660
You murderer!

1223
01:48:30,210 --> 01:48:32,329
What's going on, brother? Long time no see.

1224
01:48:32,330 --> 01:48:33,500
Hey.

1225
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:37,629
Personally, I don't feel these tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

1226
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:39,589
They get steak? That's bullshit.

1227
01:48:39,590 --> 01:48:41,180
Let me see that.

1228
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:44,099
Yeah. You know what that is. Down.

1229
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:45,469
Trudy!

1230
01:48:45,470 --> 01:48:47,020
All the way down.

1231
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,560
Max!

1232
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:04,120
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

1233
01:49:04,910 --> 01:49:05,910
Here.

1234
01:49:18,090 --> 01:49:20,550
-Clear. Come on. -Here you go.

1235
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:37,360
Max, stay here.

1236
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:39,689
I need someone on the inside I can trust.

1237
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:41,280
Okay. Go.

1238
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:56,670
Clear.

1239
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:59,459
Come on, baby.

1240
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:02,470
Colonel? Sir? I got a situation here.

1241
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:08,850
-It's Samson 1-6. -Unauthorized engine start.

1242
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:13,230
Three!

1243
01:50:16,190 --> 01:50:17,360
Come on!

1244
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:20,570
Mask on!

1245
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:24,820
Gas, gas, gas!

1246
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:28,910
I'm taking fire! Let's go!

1247
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:32,290
Grab my hand!

1248
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:34,210
Come on, we're in. Let's go!

1249
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:37,080
Come on, let's go! Let's go, go!

1250
01:50:49,970 --> 01:50:51,060
Colonel!

1251
01:50:58,060 --> 01:51:00,820
-Yeah! Yeah! -All right! Yes!

1252
01:51:04,650 --> 01:51:05,650
Crap.

1253
01:51:05,651 --> 01:51:07,449
Everybody all right back there?

1254
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:09,029
Oh, yeah, baby!

1255
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:11,200
-Norm, you good? -Yeah!

1256
01:51:11,870 --> 01:51:13,450
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

1257
01:51:14,370 --> 01:51:16,080
-Grace is hit! -What?

1258
01:51:17,290 --> 01:51:18,829
-Get the trauma kit. -Trauma kit!

1259
01:51:18,830 --> 01:51:20,209
Keep the pressure on, Grace.

1260
01:51:20,210 --> 01:51:22,549
Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

1261
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:23,799
Hang on, Grace.

1262
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:24,880
Doesn't matter.

1263
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:26,930
It's fine.

1264
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:31,679
You're good to go.

1265
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:32,890
Take it up!

1266
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:35,850
Hold on. I'm pulling pitch.

1267
01:51:40,230 --> 01:51:41,400
You're clear!

1268
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:51,950
Just keep going north. Get us deep in the mountains.

1269
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:53,700
Copy that.

1270
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:01,870
Norm, you all good up there?

1271
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:03,960
Yep! Still here.

1272
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:08,050
Well, at least they can't track us up here.

1273
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:10,509
Not this far into the Vortex.

1274
01:52:10,510 --> 01:52:13,139
It's strongest at the Tree of Souls, right?

1275
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:14,469
Yeah.

1276
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:16,310
Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.

1277
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,530
Ouch.

1278
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:30,780
You big baby.

1279
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:33,780
We're moving.

1280
01:52:34,530 --> 01:52:36,240
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

1281
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:39,410
I'm a scientist, remember?

1282
01:52:40,710 --> 01:52:42,880
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1283
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,420
The People can help you.

1284
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:47,630
I know it.

1285
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:51,430
Why would they help us?

1286
01:53:07,650 --> 01:53:10,780
The People say Eywa will provide.

1287
01:53:12,610 --> 01:53:15,740
With no home, no hope,

1288
01:53:16,410 --> 01:53:18,290
there was only one place they could go.

1289
01:53:33,010 --> 01:53:34,010
Link's running.

1290
01:53:34,930 --> 01:53:36,599
What's the plan here, Jake?

1291
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:38,010
There's no plan.

1292
01:53:38,930 --> 01:53:40,850
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.

1293
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,350
He's not gonna let you near that place.

1294
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:45,770
I gotta try.

1295
01:53:48,820 --> 01:53:50,030
Launching.

1296
01:54:11,590 --> 01:54:12,800
Outcast.

1297
01:54:13,630 --> 01:54:14,760
Betrayer.

1298
01:54:15,890 --> 01:54:16,930
Alien.

1299
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:20,970
I was in the place the eye does not see.

1300
01:54:32,610 --> 01:54:34,070
I needed their help,

1301
01:54:34,950 --> 01:54:36,360
and they needed mine.

1302
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:39,329
But to ever face them again,

1303
01:54:39,330 --> 01:54:41,580
I was gonna have to take it to a whole new level.

1304
01:54:50,420 --> 01:54:53,800
Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move.

1305
01:54:56,550 --> 01:54:57,890
There's something we gotta do.

1306
01:54:59,010 --> 01:55:00,180
You're not gonna like it.

1307
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:04,480
Yah!

1308
01:55:10,770 --> 01:55:14,279
The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.

1309
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:15,360
Nothing attacks him.

1310
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:17,820
Easy, boy.

1311
01:55:18,570 --> 01:55:20,450
So why would he ever look up?

1312
01:55:21,410 --> 01:55:22,870
But that was just a theory.

1313
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:35,860
Toruk Macto?

1314
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:16,520
I See you.

1315
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:20,950
I See you.

1316
01:57:29,450 --> 01:57:31,290
I was afraid, Jake.

1317
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:33,920
For my people.

1318
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,590
I'm not anymore.

1319
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:50,520
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo...

1320
01:57:51,230 --> 01:57:53,270
...I stand before you...

1321
01:57:54,270 --> 01:57:57,360
...ready to serve the Omaticaya people.

1322
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:01,570
You are olo'eyktan,

1323
01:58:02,490 --> 01:58:04,110
and you are a great warrior.

1324
01:58:05,450 --> 01:58:06,570
I can't do this without you.

1325
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:16,080
Toruk Macto...

1326
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:25,890
I will fly with you.

1327
01:58:28,850 --> 01:58:30,260
My friend is dying.

1328
01:58:33,310 --> 01:58:34,390
Grace is dying.

1329
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:38,020
I beg the help of Eywa.

1330
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:51,450
Look where we are, Grace.

1331
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:01,460
I need to take some samples.

1332
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:28,990
The Great Mother may choose to save all that she is

1333
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:31,660
in this body.

1334
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:35,619
Is that possible?

1335
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:40,920
She must pass through the eye of Eywa and return.

1336
01:59:41,710 --> 01:59:42,710
But, Jakesully,

1337
01:59:44,170 --> 01:59:45,380
she is very weak.

1338
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:48,430
Hang on, Grace.

1339
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:50,390
They're gonna fix you up.

1340
01:59:53,430 --> 01:59:56,020
Hear us please, All Mother.

1341
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:58,850
Eywa, help her.

1342
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:01,730
Take this spirit into you...

1343
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:07,950
...and breathe her back to us.

1344
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:13,030
Let her walk among us...

1345
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:17,460
...as one of The People.

1346
02:00:46,530 --> 02:00:47,530
Jake.

1347
02:00:49,860 --> 02:00:50,860
Grace.

1348
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:54,910
I'm with her, Jake.

1349
02:00:56,830 --> 02:00:58,250
She's real.

1350
02:01:01,170 --> 02:01:04,590
Grace? Grace, please. Grace!

1351
02:01:05,590 --> 02:01:06,920
What's happening?

1352
02:01:08,130 --> 02:01:09,380
What's happening?

1353
02:01:14,260 --> 02:01:15,260
Grace!

1354
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:16,890
Grace!

1355
02:01:19,310 --> 02:01:20,480
What's happening?

1356
02:01:27,190 --> 02:01:28,570
Did it work?

1357
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:36,280
Her wounds were too great.

1358
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:38,700
It was not enough time.

1359
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:41,330
She is with Eywa now.

1360
02:02:15,660 --> 02:02:18,410
With your permission, I will speak now.

1361
02:02:20,490 --> 02:02:22,000
You would honor me by translating.

1362
02:02:30,210 --> 02:02:32,550
The Sky People have sent us a message...

1363
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:37,850
...that they can take whatever they want

1364
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:41,720
and no one can stop them.

1365
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:47,270
Well, we will send them a message.

1366
02:02:49,860 --> 02:02:52,320
You ride out as fast as the wind can carry you.

1367
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:56,860
You tell the other clans to come.

1368
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:03,620
You tell them Toruk Macto calls to them.

1369
02:03:05,870 --> 02:03:07,880
And you fly now with me!

1370
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:12,170
My brothers! Sisters!

1371
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:15,130
And we will show the Sky People

1372
02:03:16,260 --> 02:03:18,220
that they cannot take whatever they want,

1373
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:20,640
and that this,

1374
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:23,140
this is our land!

1375
02:03:29,650 --> 02:03:30,650
Yah!

1376
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:47,580
Yah!

1377
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,360
Yah!

1378
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:37,670
We rode out to the four winds.

1379
02:04:40,300 --> 02:04:41,890
To the horse clans of the plain.

1380
02:04:45,810 --> 02:04:46,849
Back to the stars!

1381
02:04:46,850 --> 02:04:49,099
To the ikran people of the Eastern Sea.

1382
02:04:49,100 --> 02:04:50,479
For our children's children!

1383
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:53,150
When Toruk Macto called them, they came.

1384
02:04:56,690 --> 02:04:58,570
Yah!

1385
02:05:34,520 --> 02:05:36,939
Everyone on this base, every one of you,

1386
02:05:36,940 --> 02:05:39,149
is fighting for survival.

1387
02:05:39,150 --> 02:05:40,320
That's a fact.

1388
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:44,370
There's an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack.

1389
02:05:46,030 --> 02:05:47,030
Now,

1390
02:05:47,830 --> 02:05:50,449
these orbital images tell me

1391
02:05:50,450 --> 02:05:53,669
that the hostiles' numbers have gone from a few hundred

1392
02:05:53,670 --> 02:05:56,589
to well over 2,000 in one day.

1393
02:05:56,590 --> 02:05:58,880
And more are pouring in.

1394
02:06:01,300 --> 02:06:03,840
In a week's time, there could be 20,000 of them.

1395
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:07,139
At that point, they will overrun our perimeter.

1396
02:06:07,140 --> 02:06:09,430
Well, that's not gonna happen.

1397
02:06:11,060 --> 02:06:14,649
Our only security lies in pre-emptive attack.

1398
02:06:14,650 --> 02:06:17,230
We will fight terror with terror.

1399
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:25,609
Now, the hostiles believe that this mountain stronghold of theirs

1400
02:06:25,610 --> 02:06:27,280
is protected by their...

1401
02:06:28,120 --> 02:06:29,490
their deity.

1402
02:06:30,740 --> 02:06:32,749
And when we destroy it,

1403
02:06:32,750 --> 02:06:35,329
we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep

1404
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:38,919
that they won't come within 1,000 klicks of this place ever again.

1405
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:40,090
And that, too,

1406
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:41,880
is a fact.

1407
02:06:41,881 --> 02:06:44,260
Yeah! Yeah.

1408
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:56,899
Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.

1409
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:58,609
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.

1410
02:06:58,610 --> 02:07:00,939
They've got these huge pallets of mine explosives.

1411
02:07:00,940 --> 02:07:03,939
It's for some kind of shock-and-awe campaign.

1412
02:07:03,940 --> 02:07:06,030
Fricking daisy cutters!

1413
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:10,279
Quaritch has taken over. He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.

1414
02:07:10,280 --> 02:07:12,449
-When? -0600 tomorrow.

1415
02:07:12,450 --> 02:07:14,040
-Max! Max! -I gotta go.

1416
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:17,750
We're screwed!

1417
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:23,300
And I was hoping for some sort of tactical plan that didn't involve martyrdom.

1418
02:07:25,170 --> 02:07:28,260
We're going up against gunships with bows and arrows.

1419
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:33,180
I have 15 clans out there.

1420
02:07:34,310 --> 02:07:35,560
That's over 2,000 warriors.

1421
02:07:37,850 --> 02:07:39,229
Now, we know these mountains.

1422
02:07:39,230 --> 02:07:41,070
We fly them. You fly them.

1423
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:42,820
They don't.

1424
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:45,239
Their instruments won't work up here.

1425
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:47,200
Missile tracking won't work.

1426
02:07:47,910 --> 02:07:49,529
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

1427
02:07:49,530 --> 02:07:50,950
If they bring the fight to us,

1428
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:53,370
then we have the home-field advantage.

1429
02:07:55,700 --> 02:07:58,709
You know he's gonna commit that bomber straight to the Tree of Souls.

1430
02:07:58,710 --> 02:08:00,579
Yeah, I know.

1431
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:02,540
If they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.

1432
02:08:03,210 --> 02:08:06,420
That's their direct line to Eywa, their ancestors.

1433
02:08:07,050 --> 02:08:08,050
It'll destroy them.

1434
02:08:09,130 --> 02:08:10,720
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

1435
02:08:26,820 --> 02:08:29,110
I'm probably just talking to a tree right now.

1436
02:08:32,030 --> 02:08:33,660
But if you're there,

1437
02:08:35,410 --> 02:08:37,040
I need to give you a heads-up.

1438
02:08:39,330 --> 02:08:40,790
If Grace is with you,

1439
02:08:42,380 --> 02:08:43,880
look into her memories.

1440
02:08:45,090 --> 02:08:46,920
See the world we come from.

1441
02:08:48,260 --> 02:08:49,590
There's no green there.

1442
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:53,050
They killed their Mother.

1443
02:08:54,510 --> 02:08:56,060
And they're gonna do the same here.

1444
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:00,809
More Sky People are gonna come.

1445
02:09:00,810 --> 02:09:03,770
They're gonna come like a rain that never ends.

1446
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:06,820
Unless we stop them.

1447
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:10,860
Look,

1448
02:09:11,410 --> 02:09:13,030
you chose me for something.

1449
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:15,910
I will stand and fight.

1450
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:18,410
You know I will.

1451
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:22,920
But I need a little help here.

1452
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:33,300
Our Great Mother does not take sides, Jake.

1453
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:38,140
She protects only the balance of life.

1454
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:51,110
It was worth a try.

1455
02:10:22,430 --> 02:10:24,189
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

1456
02:10:24,190 --> 02:10:27,980
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about, man!

1457
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:42,620
This is Group Leader. We are entering the Flux Vortex.

1458
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:45,169
Switch to manual flight mode.

1459
02:10:45,170 --> 02:10:46,960
Copy. Manual flight mode.

1460
02:11:21,620 --> 02:11:23,869
This is Papa Dragon.

1461
02:11:23,870 --> 02:11:25,539
I want this mission high and tight.

1462
02:11:25,540 --> 02:11:27,080
I want to be home for dinner.

1463
02:11:34,840 --> 02:11:37,129
-Suit Team, go. -All right, ladies,

1464
02:11:37,130 --> 02:11:38,510
let's bring the pain!

1465
02:11:49,190 --> 02:11:50,730
Move, move, move!

1466
02:11:56,190 --> 02:11:57,909
Bravo 1-1, move left.

1467
02:11:57,910 --> 02:12:00,240
Bravo 1-1 moving left.

1468
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:02,200
Watch flank.

1469
02:12:03,870 --> 02:12:06,459
Watch formation. Keep moving.

1470
02:12:06,460 --> 02:12:07,829
Roger that.

1471
02:12:07,830 --> 02:12:10,249
Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing.

1472
02:12:10,250 --> 02:12:11,749
Copy that. Over.

1473
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:13,550
Eyes up. Check that overhead.

1474
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:16,510
And watch those thermal scans.

1475
02:12:17,010 --> 02:12:20,469
All call signs, Papa has lead, pushing to target.

1476
02:12:20,470 --> 02:12:23,180
Escorts, stay close on my shuttle.

1477
02:12:27,940 --> 02:12:30,020
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

1478
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:34,069
Gun crews, keep your head on a swivel.

1479
02:12:34,070 --> 02:12:35,360
Make no mistake, people,

1480
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:37,400
they're out there.

1481
02:12:38,700 --> 02:12:40,699
All right, people, target in sight.

1482
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:41,909
Range, four klicks.

1483
02:12:41,910 --> 02:12:44,279
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.

1484
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:45,539
Copy. Prepare to offload.

1485
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:47,539
Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

1486
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:49,670
Roll it to the ramp! Let's go!

1487
02:12:52,210 --> 02:12:53,290
Hold!

1488
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:03,139
Charlie 2-1, got big movement.

1489
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:04,809
-Hold position. -Hold up, hold up.

1490
02:13:04,810 --> 02:13:06,809
We got movement out there, 500 meters.

1491
02:13:06,810 --> 02:13:08,600
Charlie 2-1, hold position.

1492
02:13:15,150 --> 02:13:16,439
Sir, ground has movement.

1493
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:18,029
Fast approaching.

1494
02:13:18,030 --> 02:13:19,739
Charlie Oscar, Rider section.

1495
02:13:19,740 --> 02:13:20,819
Firing line!

1496
02:13:20,820 --> 02:13:23,910
Targets closing. Range, 400 meters.

1497
02:13:24,410 --> 02:13:25,659
Can't you clean it up?

1498
02:13:25,660 --> 02:13:27,330
No, sir. It's the Flux.

1499
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:57,820
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole. You follow me through.

1500
02:14:39,820 --> 02:14:42,740
All aircraft, weapons free! Weapons free!

1501
02:14:43,860 --> 02:14:45,070
Break right. Come around.

1502
02:14:48,490 --> 02:14:49,830
Light them up!

1503
02:14:57,710 --> 02:15:00,000
Break formation, engage all hostiles.

1504
02:15:07,050 --> 02:15:09,100
Yeah! Get some!

1505
02:15:48,090 --> 02:15:49,930
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1506
02:16:00,690 --> 02:16:02,480
Jake! Jake! You copy?

1507
02:16:03,150 --> 02:16:05,360
We're falling back! We're getting hammered!

1508
02:16:05,900 --> 02:16:07,200
Copy. Get out of there.

1509
02:16:12,080 --> 02:16:13,540
That's him. Get after him!

1510
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:31,430
Take him out!

1511
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:37,520
Oops.

1512
02:16:40,020 --> 02:16:41,060
Light her up!

1513
02:16:50,990 --> 02:16:52,279
Right there!

1514
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:54,200
You're not the only one with a gun, bitch.

1515
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:56,449
-Keep her in your sights. -Purging. Feeding the leak.

1516
02:16:56,450 --> 02:16:57,580
Arming all pods.

1517
02:17:03,210 --> 02:17:04,380
That's it!

1518
02:17:34,820 --> 02:17:35,910
Seyzey!

1519
02:18:40,180 --> 02:18:42,060
Rogue One is hit. I'm going in.

1520
02:18:43,180 --> 02:18:44,390
Sorry, Jake.

1521
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:54,490
Fire.

1522
02:19:12,670 --> 02:19:14,089
Tsu'tey!

1523
02:19:14,090 --> 02:19:15,470
Brother, do you read?

1524
02:19:17,890 --> 02:19:19,430
Rogue One, you copy?

1525
02:19:21,680 --> 02:19:22,680
Trudy!

1526
02:19:33,650 --> 02:19:34,989
Time to target, two minutes.

1527
02:19:34,990 --> 02:19:37,819
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.

1528
02:19:37,820 --> 02:19:40,030
Copy, Dragon. We are starting our bomb run.

1529
02:19:45,910 --> 02:19:47,370
Arm number one!

1530
02:19:48,250 --> 02:19:50,000
Number one armed!

1531
02:19:50,840 --> 02:19:53,919
Ma Jake! Ma Jake!

1532
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:55,420
I read you.

1533
02:20:04,220 --> 02:20:05,559
Neytiri!

1534
02:20:05,560 --> 02:20:07,099
Seyzey's dead.

1535
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:09,150
They are very close. They are many.

1536
02:20:11,060 --> 02:20:12,270
Do not attack.

1537
02:20:12,940 --> 02:20:14,690
Do you read me, Neytiri?

1538
02:20:17,650 --> 02:20:18,949
Do not attack!

1539
02:20:18,950 --> 02:20:21,279
Fall back now. Get out of there!

1540
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:22,530
That's an order!

1541
02:20:29,870 --> 02:20:31,080
Neytiri!

1542
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:35,839
I got movement, I got movement.

1543
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:37,379
Hold position.

1544
02:20:37,380 --> 02:20:39,879
-Something's coming. -Bravo 1-1...

1545
02:20:39,880 --> 02:20:42,009
-We got movement 200 meters. -Hold your formation.

1546
02:20:42,010 --> 02:20:44,010
-Be ready. -Watch your flanks.

1547
02:20:49,060 --> 02:20:50,730
Hundred meters and closing fast.

1548
02:21:07,250 --> 02:21:08,580
We gotta get out of here!

1549
02:21:10,710 --> 02:21:12,709
-Fall back! Fall back! -Move! Move! Move!

1550
02:21:12,710 --> 02:21:14,380
Fall back! On the run! On the run!

1551
02:21:22,010 --> 02:21:23,010
Jake,

1552
02:21:23,720 --> 02:21:25,100
Eywa has heard you.

1553
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:33,560
Eywa has heard you!

1554
02:21:43,780 --> 02:21:44,780
Come on!

1555
02:21:57,550 --> 02:21:59,420
Fall back! Move! Move!

1556
02:22:24,110 --> 02:22:26,699
Sir! All escorts are down or falling back.

1557
02:22:26,700 --> 02:22:28,370
Let's get this done.

1558
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:30,909
Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

1559
02:22:30,910 --> 02:22:32,120
Press to target.

1560
02:22:32,790 --> 02:22:34,209
Copy. Pressing to target.

1561
02:22:34,210 --> 02:22:35,920
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1562
02:22:55,810 --> 02:22:58,189
On my mark. Two, one, mark.

1563
02:22:58,190 --> 02:22:59,729
Drop! Drop! Drop!

1564
02:22:59,730 --> 02:23:01,190
Go, go, go, go!

1565
02:23:34,310 --> 02:23:35,850
Brace!

1566
02:23:52,870 --> 02:23:53,950
It's Sully.

1567
02:24:07,930 --> 02:24:09,089
Mask on!

1568
02:24:09,090 --> 02:24:10,300
Breach alarm!

1569
02:26:47,130 --> 02:26:49,170
Come on. Come to papa.

1570
02:27:16,950 --> 02:27:18,120
Give it up, Quaritch!

1571
02:27:21,620 --> 02:27:22,750
It's all over.

1572
02:27:24,370 --> 02:27:26,499
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

1573
02:27:26,500 --> 02:27:28,500
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

1574
02:28:23,890 --> 02:28:26,020
Come on!

1575
02:28:42,450 --> 02:28:43,530
Hey, Sully,

1576
02:28:44,290 --> 02:28:46,410
how's it feel to betray your own race?

1577
02:28:51,170 --> 02:28:53,000
You think you're one of them?

1578
02:28:54,590 --> 02:28:56,420
Time to wake up.

1579
02:30:40,530 --> 02:30:41,530
Jake?

1580
02:30:55,210 --> 02:30:56,580
Jake.

1581
02:31:14,060 --> 02:31:15,310
Jake.

1582
02:31:31,740 --> 02:31:33,790
Jake! Ma Jake!

1583
02:32:15,410 --> 02:32:16,750
I See you.

1584
02:32:22,420 --> 02:32:23,880
I See you.

1585
02:32:35,220 --> 02:32:37,690
The aliens went back to their dying world.

1586
02:32:40,230 --> 02:32:41,440
Only a few

1587
02:32:42,190 --> 02:32:43,360
were chosen to stay.

1588
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:58,660
You know this isn't over.

1589
02:33:12,050 --> 02:33:14,180
The time of great sorrow was ending.

1590
02:33:16,560 --> 02:33:18,680
Toruk Macto was no longer needed.

1591
02:33:31,490 --> 02:33:32,490
Well, uh,

1592
02:33:33,410 --> 02:33:35,370
I guess this is my last video log.

1593
02:33:37,240 --> 02:33:38,660
'Cause whatever happens tonight,

1594
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:41,170
either way, I'm...

1595
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,880
I'm not gonna be coming back to this place.

1596
02:33:48,510 --> 02:33:49,920
Well, I guess I'd better go.

1597
02:33:53,340 --> 02:33:55,300
I don't want to be late for my own party.

1598
02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:01,390
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all.

1599
02:34:04,650 --> 02:34:06,480
This is Jake Sully signing off.
