1
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,044
Just one sec.

2
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:46,711
Hasta El Fuego. Please hold.

3
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,797
Okay.

4
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:50,048
This way.

5
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:53,760
-See ya.
-All right, see ya.

6
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:56,263
Here you are.
Your server will be right with you.

7
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:01,643
-Hey, Jason.
-Hey.

8
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,480
Hi. Do you know what you want?

9
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,482
Yeah. Thanks.

10
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:09,401
-So, how was it?
-It was great.

11
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:11,153
Hi!

12
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:49,650
-Another shot?
-Yeah, sure. Okay.

13
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:56,907
-Hi, Reggie. Hello.
-Laura, hi.

14
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,203
So nice to phone-meet you
in this incredibly embarrassing way.

15
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,623
You know, no problem. It's fine.

16
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:08,043
This is what I get for picking a
trendy place with no sign out front, huh?

17
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,337
Yeah, why do they do that here?

18
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,173
[ Don't know. I've only been in the city
for a few months.

19
00:02:13,257 --> 00:02:15,467
-Me too! No way! Yeah.
-Oh, wow.

20
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:18,095
Well, it's a very cool restaurant.

21
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,681
-Is it on Hudson?
-Yes.

22
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,517
-Am I on Hudson?
-I don't know.

23
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,728
[I am not on Hudson. Shit.

24
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,981
<i>I am now walking towards Hudson.</i>

25
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,649
-Okay.
-/ am so, so sorry.

26
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,027
<i>This is not the first impression
I wanted to make on a college professor.</i>

27
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,239
Associate Professor,
and it's just Film Studies...

28
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:39,784
so you're safe.

29
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:42,244
Film Studies? That's cool.

30
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:45,872
You say that, but try teaching a class
on 20th-century slashers

31
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:47,958
to a heap of hungover 19-year-olds.

32
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,795
Slashers, huh?
What's your favorite scary movie?

33
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:54,214
Not that one.

34
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:57,634
So, why slashers?

35
00:02:57,718 --> 00:02:59,928
Well, I just--
You know, I think it's interesting.

36
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:02,055
You can really examine
the culture of the moment

37
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:03,682
by looking at the tropes of the time.

38
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:08,103
Like the masked killer,
the final girl, the different rules:

39
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,523
Don't split up. Don't have sex.

40
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:15,360
-Don't answer the phone.
-Exactly, exactly, exactly.

41
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:16,528
It's all cliché.

42
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:20,324
But out of those clichés
comes an opportunity for outsider art.

43
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,743
A voice for the voiceless, you might say.

44
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,620
Jesus Christ.

45
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,123
<i>Yeah, I'm more of a rom-com guy,
to be honest.</i>

46
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:30,125
-Okay, I think I'm on Hudson.
-Okay.

47
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,044
What color is the outside
of the restaurant?

48
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,213
I think it's red.

49
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,549
I don't see anything red.

50
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,926
I could be wrong. Let me just...

51
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,596
Let me go have a little look-see.

52
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,306
Okay. Thank you.

53
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,563
Yep, it's definitely red.

54
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:53,732
Yeah, I'm not seeing anything red here.

55
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,527
Sure you're on Hudson?

56
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:59,321
Crap, I'm still a block over.

57
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,366
It looks like there's an alley
[ can cut through.

58
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,076
ls the restaurant near an alley ?

59
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:08,372
Yes! Yes. There is an alley.

60
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,541
Perfect. I'm coming down the alley.

61
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,713
I don't see you.

62
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,632
Wait. Really? Are you sure?

63
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:26,932
There are some dumpsters
about halfway down.

64
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:30,685
I see them, but I don't see you.

65
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:33,271
Yeah, I don't see you, either.

66
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,817
This is creepy, right?

67
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:38,652
A little bit.

68
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,238
20th-century slashers, huh?

69
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,574
Yeah. Are you sure you're walking
towards Hudson?

70
00:04:43,657 --> 00:04:44,741
I'm sure.

71
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:47,869
Oh, wait, I think I see you! Can you wave?

72
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:49,830
Can you see me?

73
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:55,206
The person I'm looking at isn't waving.
They're just... staring at me.

74
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,128
Are you sure?

75
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,673
Okay, this is weird.

76
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:03,844
<i>Now they're moving towards me.</i>

77
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,471
Are you okay?

78
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:07,514
Shit. He's following me.

79
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,349
I don't see anybody.

80
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:12,227
Holy shit, he's after me!

81
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:13,687
Where are you?

82
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,689
-He's got a knife!
-What?

83
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,483
And that's not the worst part.

84
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,568
The worst part is...

85
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,196
<i>you teach a class about slashers</i>

86
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:26,658
and you still walked
info a dark alley. Alone.

87
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:28,535
Okay, that's not funny.

88
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,541
No.

89
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,667
It's not.

90
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,828
Now I see something red.

91
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,478
Oh, hey. Tara!

92
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:19,896
Jason.

93
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,898
Are you and Greg gonna come
to the OKB party?

94
00:07:21,982 --> 00:07:24,818
Well, if he finishes his Spanish project
in time, yes, we will.

95
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,111
Is your sister coming?

96
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,113
No, Sam wouldn't be caught dead
at a frat party.

97
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:30,240
There's a first time for everything.

98
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,408
Not tonight, though.

99
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,120
-Can't convince her?
-That's not my problem, that's yours.

100
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,456
-Save me a drink!
-All right. I'll see you.

101
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,887
Honey, I'm home!

102
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:57,559
Greg?

103
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,271
Greg?

104
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,223
I'm sorry, okay?

105
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:40,806
I just got massive blue balls,
and I had to practice.

106
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,897
Please don't be mad. How mad are you?

107
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,777
I'm not mad, Jason.

108
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,406
Dude. We said we wouldn't
use the voice on each other.

109
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:54,199
We said a lot of things.

110
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,786
This is Greg, right?

111
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:01,998
Who else would it be?

112
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,585
Where are you?
I want to tell you about it.

113
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:06,920
Oh, by the way...

114
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:10,173
we should go to that frat party.
Tara's going.

115
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:12,717
-What was it like?
-Not on the phone, man.

116
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:15,303
And, seriously,
turn off the fucking voice modulator!

117
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:17,639
I'm just trying to get the voice right.

118
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,851
<i>You got to have your practice, I get mine.</i>

119
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:22,477
Whatever.

120
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,063
Just tell me what it felt like.

121
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,733
Then maybe I'll come out.

122
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:29,108
Dude, I know you're not here.

123
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,486
Humor me.

124
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,113
All right, fine.

125
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:40,203
It was even better
than we ever could have imagined.

126
00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:44,249
I mean, when the knife went in her,

127
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,503
it's like she wasn't human anymore.

128
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,714
Just an animal.

129
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:55,635
And every time it went in,

130
00:09:56,261 --> 00:10:00,598
she was less and less human.

131
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,477
And then...

132
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,397
she was just meat.

133
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,442
But she wasn't just meat, Jason.

134
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:13,736
She was a person. Our film professor.

135
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:14,905
Yeah, well...

136
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:17,198
fuck her.

137
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,788
She gave me a C-minus on my giallo paper.

138
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:25,665
ls that why you killed her?
Because of the C-minus?

139
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,335
Who's next,
your grade-school vice principal?

140
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:32,380
You know who's next.
Why are you being like this?

141
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:36,676
Come on, Jason.
How long have we known each other?

142
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,597
You tell me.

143
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:49,356
Eight years.
We met in junior high. In Atlanta.

144
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:54,607
I just want you to tell me why you think
you're doing this. In your words.

145
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:56,446
We're finishing Richie's film.

146
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,907
That's right, by killing Sam and Tara.

147
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,325
Why are you fucking with me?

148
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,120
Why won't you tell me where you are?

149
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:06,331
<i>Why do you keep asking me that?
I already told you.</i>

150
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,041
I'm here.

151
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,795
Let's play a game.

152
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,463
Oh, shit.

153
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,131
Do you know Warmer, Colder?

154
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:19,969
Come on. Find me, then we'll go
and cut up the Carpenter sisters.

155
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:22,180
Are you using the fucking cameras?

156
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,015
Yeah. The cameras.

157
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:28,102
And at the moment, you're very, very cold.

158
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,897
All right, douchebag, let's play.

159
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:38,738
Cold.

160
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:45,954
Heating up.

161
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:53,378
Warmer.

162
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:57,632
Warmer.

163
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,319
All right, you know what? This is stupid.
I'm gonna hang up now.

164
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:18,945
<i>But you're getting warmer.</i>

165
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:25,076
Colder.

166
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:33,501
Warmer.

167
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:36,546
Warmer.

168
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,591
You're on fire!

169
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:42,635
Oh, fuck!

170
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,895
Do you feel like an animal, Jason?

171
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,357
Please, stop!

172
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:00,236
Like meat?

173
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:05,533
But we have to finish the movie.

174
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:07,535
Who gives a fuck about movies?

175
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:43,237
So how are the new meds treating you?

176
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:45,906
Okay, I think.

177
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,452
Still not seeing anyone I shouldn't be.

178
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,747
What I'm really worried about,
though, is Tara.

179
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,792
What I'm really worried about is you.

180
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,420
You've been coming here
for six months now,

181
00:13:58,503 --> 00:14:01,964
and all we've really spoken about
is how your sister isn't dealing with

182
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:05,552
whatever happened to both of you
a year ago.

183
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,138
Now, you've alluded
to an abusive relationship,

184
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:10,473
issues with your father...

185
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,353
But every time I push you for specifics,

186
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,438
you shut down.

187
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:20,149
I have trust issues.

188
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:21,902
Okay.

189
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,238
If I'm going to help you,

190
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,284
I need you to give me the details.

191
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,457
Okay.

192
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,716
My father was Billy Loomis.

193
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,093
He was a famous serial killer.

194
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,929
They made a movie about him.

195
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:53,057
Yeah. Certainly did.

196
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:56,811
Last year I found out
that my boyfriend was also a serial killer

197
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:59,147
and only dating me
because he idolized my father.

198
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,901
Him and his psycho girlfriend
killed a bunch of people.

199
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:04,860
And when it got out
that I'm Billy's daughter,

200
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,655
this crazy rumor started online

201
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:08,948
that I orchestrated the whole thing
and framed them.

202
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,043
Richie was my boyfriend.

203
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,509
But you didn't.

204
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:30,886
-Of course not.
-Okay.

205
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,723
He almost killed my sister and me

206
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,058
before I stopped him.

207
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,435
Okay, and how--

208
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:39,896
How did you stop him?

209
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:43,107
Well, I stabbed him 22 times
and slit his throat.

210
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,651
Then I shot him in the head.

211
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,737
But that's not why I'm here.

212
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,616
Why are you here?

213
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:54,369
Because...

214
00:15:58,206 --> 00:16:00,374
it felt right.

215
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,299
I—-

216
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,384
I think we're done here.

217
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:13,888
What? No, you said give you details.
I'm just--

218
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:17,058
I'm not equipped
to deal with this kind of thing.

219
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,019
Please, Dr. Stone.
I'm asking for your help.

220
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:22,730
By law, I'm required to report this
to the authorities.

221
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:24,649
Report it? Report what?

222
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,734
I didn't say I was gonna do anything.

223
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:28,903
Not explicitly, no.

224
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:30,071
You know what?

225
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,115
Forget it.

226
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,368
You're just like all the others.

227
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,478
Hey, you've reached Tara.
Why aren't you texting me?

228
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:03,312
You know you're supposed to pick up
when I call.

229
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:05,356
I got out of therapy early,

230
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,859
so I was thinking
maybe we cook dinner tonight.

231
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:10,069
If you want. I'll see you soon.

232
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,208
Hey!

233
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:29,965
Tara?

234
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,445
Quinn?

235
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,033
Were we being too loud?

236
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:00,620
Not at all. Have you seen Tara?

237
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:03,206
Don't be mad.

238
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,208
-Why would I be mad?
-Because you get mad.

239
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,210
Is that Paul?

240
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,337
Who the fuck is Paul?

241
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:12,631
Life, I have found,

242
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,884
is about variety.

243
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,765
Okay.

244
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,519
-This one's yours.
-Thanks.

245
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,897
-Where's Tara?
-She went to the Omega Kappa Beta party.

246
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,857
I begged her not to go to that!

247
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:31,317
And we've now arrived at mad.

248
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,363
Do you know if she at least
took her Taser?

249
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,947
I cannot speak to how heavily armed
Tara is at this fraternity party.

250
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,581
Babe, are you coming back?

251
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:47,500
-"Babe"?
-I don't know.

252
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:55,758
Is Cute Boy shirtless again?

253
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:58,177
-Who's Cute Boy, babe?
-Always you,

254
00:18:58,845 --> 00:18:59,846
sweetie.

255
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:02,181
You guys have been
checking each other out for months.

256
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:03,599
Why don't you just talk to him?

257
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:06,644
Because that right there is about all
the romantic interaction I'm ready for.

258
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,147
-I'm gonna go find Tara.
-Okay.

259
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,814
-Be right back.
-Bye.

260
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:12,900
Damn.

261
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,468
-What up, man?
-Do you need another beer?

262
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,640
Oh, my God, Laura! How are you?

263
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,313
It doesn't bother you?

264
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,482
I mean, being at a house party

265
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:56,193
after you were almost
brutally murdered at a house party?

266
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:58,821
No, I think of it
like being struck by lightning.

267
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,034
The odds of it happening twice
to the same person are extremely low.

268
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,329
Guess I should stay close to you then.

269
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,167
-Shit, I'm sorry.
-Watch out.

270
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,293
Hi.

271
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,005
<i>How are you doing, 1?</i>

272
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,090
Okay.

273
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:19,633
You're lying.

274
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,219
No, last one's kicked.

275
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:23,554
We got some hard stuff
in the kitchen, though.

276
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,558
Frankie.

277
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,435
Tara.

278
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,728
Lead the way.

279
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,148
You Omega Beta Zeta?

280
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:35,608
No, not yet. But I might rush it.

281
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,277
Oh, freshman. Right on!

282
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,322
Where from?

283
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,492
Michigan.

284
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,077
All right.

285
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,620
You know what?

286
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,248
I got a bottle of Fireball up in my room.

287
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,420
Fuck it. Yeah, go.

288
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,967
Oh, I don't love that.

289
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,011
Hey! You want to call it a night?

290
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:06,138
No...

291
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,600
I think that I'm actually
still gonna hang,

292
00:21:08,683 --> 00:21:10,351
but you guys don't have to wait for me.

293
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,062
Don't worry. I'll take care of her.
I'm Frankie.

294
00:21:13,813 --> 00:21:17,483
And I'm spectacularly uninterested
in knowing anything about you.

295
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,405
No, dude, Anika, I'm not that bad.

296
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:25,532
But I appreciate you looking out for me.

297
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,539
Lemme see it in your face.

298
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:34,041
Closer. Closer.

299
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:36,544
All right, all right.

300
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,755
Cheers to the dynamic duo

301
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:41,841
of Hortense Tower, third floor, room 315.

302
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:48,639
Oh, man. Time to start making moves.

303
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:50,975
Get you out there.
Introduce you to some girls!

304
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,101
What about her?

305
00:21:53,728 --> 00:21:54,895
She's gorgeous.

306
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:56,480
-Great, ask her out.
-No, I can't.

307
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:58,190
Ask her out. Ask her out.

308
00:21:58,274 --> 00:21:59,441
Shut up!

309
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,570
Got to have confidence.
Plus, look at you, man! You're a snack!

310
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,947
Practically an entire meal
all on your own.

311
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:07,033
-Really?
-Yeah. You're Ethan Landry.

312
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:08,450
Hey, excuse me!

313
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,662
-Chad.
-Howdy. How you doing?

314
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:13,038
My friend here, he's a snack, right?

315
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:19,086
-What did that mean?
-No, it's good.

316
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,254
-What?
-It's not bad.

317
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:21,589
There's room for improvement!

318
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,132
Hey, big guy, you're needed.

319
00:22:25,176 --> 00:22:26,510
See ya.

320
00:22:26,594 --> 00:22:30,556
Aren't you that girl involved in that
Stab shit in California last year?

321
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:33,184
No. That's a different pirate.

322
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,811
Hey, partner!

323
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:37,438
Tara's good down here.

324
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:39,857
Sorry, bro, I didn't catch that.

325
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,069
Yeah, you did.

326
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:44,278
No, Chad.

327
00:22:45,613 --> 00:22:48,157
-It's fine. I want to.
-Yeah, see, Chad?

328
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,576
-It's okay.
-She wants to.

329
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,374
-Get your fucking hands off her.
-Get the fuck off me!

330
00:22:56,457 --> 00:22:57,666
Guys!

331
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,835
Who the fuck are you, Risky Business?

332
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,378
-Stop!
-Guys!

333
00:23:01,462 --> 00:23:04,798
Sorry to interrupt. I'm just gonna
tase you in the balls real quick.

334
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:09,261
Don't ever lay hands on my sister.

335
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:11,472
You fucking bitch!

336
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:13,390
-Fuck you!
-Sam.

337
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:15,017
Are you fucking kidding me?

338
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:16,519
You're stalking me now?

339
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,106
Holy shit, it's that psycho girl!

340
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,191
That's her?

341
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,154
Tara. Will you stop?

342
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:29,240
I cannot believe you did that!
You embarrassed me.

343
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,367
That guy was a dick.
He was gonna take advantage of you.

344
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,743
-So?
-So?

345
00:23:32,827 --> 00:23:35,454
If I want to hook up with an asshole,
that's my decision!

346
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,083
-It's my decision. It's not about you.
-Okay.

347
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,960
You're out of my life for five years,

348
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,129
and then you can't leave me alone
for five minutes.

349
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:45,839
Because you're not dealing
with what happened to us.

350
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,800
Have you even gone
to see the counselor once?

351
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,385
-No, I'm not going to.
-Why not?

352
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,722
Because I'm uninterested
in living in the past like you are.

353
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:54,515
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Guys, come on.

354
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,393
It means I'm not gonna let
what happened to us for three days

355
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,103
define the rest of my life.

356
00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:02,022
So you're just gonna
pretend it never happened.

357
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,984
What are you doing here, Sam? In New York.

358
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,320
You're working two shitty jobs
to help with rent, whatever,

359
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:09,696
but what's your plan?

360
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,700
I know what I'm gonna do.

361
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,536
Okay? Because I'm gonna
keep going to college,

362
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,205
I'm gonna get my degree,
and I'm gonna live my life.

363
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:19,957
My life.

364
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,084
Okay? I know.

365
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,714
You just followed me here,
and you won't let me out of your sight.

366
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,719
-I'm just trying to look out for you.

367
00:24:33,012 --> 00:24:34,013
I know.

368
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,389
I know you are.

369
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:39,351
You can't do it
for the rest of my life, though.

370
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:42,438
You have to let me go.

371
00:24:44,148 --> 00:24:45,232
Hey!

372
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,527
Murderer!

373
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,945
What the fuck is wrong with you, bitch?

374
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:51,196
You got a problem with me?

375
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,573
You guys should stay away from her.
She knows what she did.

376
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,159
I didn't fucking do anything!

377
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,702
Sure, bitch.

378
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:57,787
Walk away!

379
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,081
-I'm so sick of this shit.
-Hey, calm down. Come on.

380
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,460
Hey, I have tissues if you want tissues.

381
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:07,504
I have, like, three tissues.

382
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:31,612
Hey.

383
00:25:32,488 --> 00:25:34,907
I'm sorry I told Sam where you went.

384
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,951
It's fine. I just...

385
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,121
She's all the way up my ass

386
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,040
like usual.

387
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,918
I know what it's like
when they hold on too tight.

388
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,546
After we...

389
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:51,840
lost my brother...

390
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,886
my dad wouldn't leave me alone.

391
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,974
He even transferred to the NYPD
when I got into college, so...

392
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,893
Stalker much?

393
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:08,732
I'm gonna go, let you guys... chat.

394
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,280
Thank you.

395
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:15,364
You can...

396
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,241
go back to your dorm.

397
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,076
I'm pretty sure
the fighting is done for the day.

398
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,536
That's too bad.

399
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:24,331
I was actually looking forward
to getting some shots in while I can.

400
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:25,666
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

401
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,834
Bring it.

402
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,632
Thank you...

403
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:36,510
for not letting me go up those stairs.

404
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:44,059
I don't know, I think I was
just more messed up than I realized.

405
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,107
Survivors got to stick together.

406
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:55,071
And besides, you can do a lot better
than Date Rape Frankie.

407
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,406
Tara, you're...

408
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,869
I think you're really special.

409
00:27:13,714 --> 00:27:15,257
I'm not messed up anymore.

410
00:27:17,051 --> 00:27:18,385
Just so you know.

411
00:27:20,054 --> 00:27:21,138
Okay.

412
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:25,726
I forgot my phone.

413
00:27:27,603 --> 00:27:28,604
Did I cock-block you?

414
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,606
-What did you just say?
-I cock-blocked you.

415
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,192
-I cock-blocked you, didn't I?
-Immediate no.

416
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,860
Please stop saying the word "cock."

417
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,821
-What did you need?
-My phone.

418
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:40,157
-Don't ever enter a room like that again.
-I won't.

419
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,617
-No, it was rude.
-I'm gonna go.

420
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,911
But get some rest, get sober

421
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,081
and please don't kill your sister, okay?
She loves you very much.

422
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,501
-Good night!
-Bye-bye.

423
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:54,171
-Quinn...
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

424
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,049
Fuck.

425
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:50,728
Careful.

426
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,188
Someone might see us.

427
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,151
You always say the most romantic things.

428
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:01,154
-Danny.
-What?

429
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,909
Can I help it if my kink is
"woman who's ashamed to be seen with me"?

430
00:29:04,992 --> 00:29:08,036
Come on. You know it's not that. I'm just...

431
00:29:08,996 --> 00:29:12,457
-not ready for--
-I know, for your sister and your friends...

432
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:16,127
to know that you enjoy physical contact
with another human being.

433
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:19,465
I get it, I do.
Your secret is safe with me.

434
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,135
A little thing-- It's not a big deal--

435
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,971
I just can't help but notice
that you're covered in Cherry Coke.

436
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:28,432
I'm pretty sure
it's Diet Cherry Coke, actually.

437
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:32,853
-What, you don't like it?
-No, I love it! I do.

438
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:36,106
It's a very sensual, aromatic choice.

439
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:41,153
Was that another conspiracy nut?

440
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:44,281
Being famous
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

441
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:48,910
And Tara's pissed at me. Again.

442
00:29:49,578 --> 00:29:51,413
She says she wants me to let her go.

443
00:29:52,915 --> 00:29:54,666
Yeah, family can be rough.

444
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,168
Sam!

445
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,878
Get up here right now!

446
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,006
I'm standing in front
of the apartment building...

447
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,841
-What's going on?
-...where the mutilated bodies

448
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:04,843
-of two students. ..
-Cute Boy. Nice.

449
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:08,680
...were discovered. Their names
have just been released by police.

450
00:30:08,764 --> 00:30:10,432
Jason Carvey and Greg Bruckner.

451
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:12,935
Holy shit, that's that chode
from our Film Studies class!

452
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,395
The one obsessed with Argento.

453
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:17,564
Also found aft the scene were
various Ghostface costumes,

454
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:21,735
a character popularized
by the Stab movie franchise.

455
00:30:22,611 --> 00:30:24,571
Pack a bag. We leave in ten.

456
00:30:24,655 --> 00:30:26,031
Sam! Wait, Sam!

457
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,699
-We're getting out of the city.
-What?

458
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:29,951
Thank you, suspicious new guy,
but we got it from here.

459
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:33,456
Have a good night. Get home safe.
Go, go, go...

460
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:34,873
Sam!

461
00:30:34,957 --> 00:30:35,958
Sam.

462
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,752
-Hold on.
-Come on.

463
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:40,170
No, wait, let's talk about this
for a second.

464
00:30:40,254 --> 00:30:42,005
Because this might not
have anything to do with us.

465
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:44,132
-Are you serious?
-It's a big city!

466
00:30:44,216 --> 00:30:45,884
It's Halloween. Everybody's wearing masks!

467
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:48,303
-You don't know.
-Tara, this isn't a coincidence.

468
00:30:49,388 --> 00:30:50,347
You knew him!

469
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,558
-Barely.
-Chad, Mindy, back me up.

470
00:30:52,641 --> 00:30:54,267
It is a little bit...

471
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,519
Close to home.

472
00:30:56,395 --> 00:30:57,562
See?

473
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,900
Quinn, your dad's a cop, right?

474
00:31:00,983 --> 00:31:02,985
Can you call him
and find out what's going on?

475
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,821
Before you make the unilateral decision
to abandon my college education

476
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,823
and flee the fucking state!

477
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,617
I'm calling him now.

478
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,951
Thank you.

479
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,295
Who is it?

480
00:31:25,424 --> 00:31:27,592
Why did everyone just freak out
when her phone rang?

481
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,720
You got to keep up, my dude.

482
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,180
Sam?

483
00:31:31,263 --> 00:31:32,889
My dad wants to talk to you.

484
00:31:33,974 --> 00:31:36,476
-Mr. Bailey, hi.
-Hey, Sam.

485
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,313
I was actually just about to call you.

486
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,899
Well, my sister thinks
I'm probably overreacting.

487
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,527
No, unfortunately, you're not.

488
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,320
What do you mean? What's going on?

489
00:31:47,738 --> 00:31:50,323
I'm afraid I need you to come down
to the station.

490
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,581
Sam, slow down.

491
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,958
Tara, no. Get back inside, lock the door.

492
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:02,335
Are you serious?
Now you don't want to stick together?

493
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,005
Fine.

494
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,811
What the fuck?

495
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,022
I never deleted his contact.

496
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:24,733
-This is coming from his number.
-Don't pick that up.

497
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,860
Just let it ring.

498
00:32:28,195 --> 00:32:29,529
Sam.

499
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:32,449
-Who is this?
-Hello, Samantha.

500
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,534
Did you miss me?

501
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:37,537
I want you to think long and hard
about whether you really want to do this.

502
00:32:37,621 --> 00:32:40,540
Because the last two people
that fucked with us ended up dead.

503
00:32:40,624 --> 00:32:43,126
You should be thanking me, Sam.

504
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,839
<i>Jason and Greg were gonna
kill you and your sister.</i>

505
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:51,135
[ Gutted them before they had the chance.

506
00:32:57,057 --> 00:32:59,893
So what? You're protecting us now?

507
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:01,311
Not quite.

508
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:03,855
<i>I'm going to show the world
who you really are:</i>

509
00:33:03,939 --> 00:33:05,857
A liar and a killer.

510
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:08,485
<i>I'm going to punish you, Sam.</i>

511
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,321
You shouldn't believe everything you read
on the Internet, asshole.

512
00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:13,824
Don't be cute.
You're gonna pay for what you did.

513
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,368
And I'm not gonna stop
until I butcher you.

514
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,454
You and anyone who gets between us.

515
00:33:18,537 --> 00:33:20,664
<i>You and Tara better watch your backs.</i>

516
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,166
You better watch yours.

517
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,460
No!

518
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,630
Come on! Run!

519
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,591
Come on!

520
00:33:30,674 --> 00:33:32,300
Help! Please!

521
00:33:32,384 --> 00:33:33,385
In there!

522
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,765
Please help us!

523
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:39,474
-We were just attacked.
-Call 911!

524
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:41,059
There's a fucking line here, girls.

525
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,690
You got a problem here, guy?

526
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,466
-Go out the back!
-Thank you!

527
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:17,679
-Fuck, it's locked.
-Keys! We need your keys!

528
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,308
-Look out!
-Watch out!

529
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,856
Wait.

530
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,733
Wait, wait! No, no, no!

531
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,833
Run! Go! Run!

532
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,716
-Going around back.
-Stay back there, ma'am.

533
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,286
This was found next to the body
at the apartment crime scene.

534
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:51,041
DNA says that it belonged
to someone named Richie Kirsch.

535
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:54,419
Does that ring a bell?

536
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,006
We're familiar with him.

537
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,592
But the one that attacked us
had a different mask on.

538
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,637
It was kind of more beat up.
Like it was older.

539
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,391
I got to ask...

540
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,268
do you have alibis for earlier tonight?

541
00:37:10,936 --> 00:37:12,771
I was at a party with my friends.

542
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,231
I was at my therapist's.

543
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,735
I can give you his information.
You can call to check if you want.

544
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,444
And then I met Tara at that party

545
00:37:19,945 --> 00:37:21,237
where I tased someone.

546
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,407
Unrelated.

547
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,910
Was that before or after this happened?

548
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,705
<i>-Murderer!
-What the fuck is wrong with you, bitch?</i>

549
00:37:29,788 --> 00:37:31,164
You got a problem with me?

550
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:32,082
Before.

551
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,459
The point is,
we were with people all night.

552
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,795
So, our roommate's dad

553
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,548
just happened to pull our case.

554
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:42,050
-That'd be a crazy coincidence, right?
-Yeah.

555
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,678
The detective who had the case
offered it to me

556
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,346
because it involves Quinn.

557
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,850
But I can totally give it back
if you're uncomfortable.

558
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:50,934
It's up to you.

559
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,023
It's fine.

560
00:37:56,982 --> 00:37:59,442
So if the man who attacked you
did steal your license

561
00:37:59,526 --> 00:38:00,985
and plant it next to the body...

562
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:04,364
it'd probably be somebody close to you.

563
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,451
How long have you known your friends?

564
00:38:07,534 --> 00:38:10,954
Well, we moved here with Mindy and Chad
for summer semester like six months ago.

565
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,333
Quinn, Ethan, Anika-- all since then.

566
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,880
I think I can vouch for Quinn,
so that's one less we have to worry about.

567
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,717
Do either of you have anyone
that might want to target you?

568
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:27,261
Not anyone who's still alive.

569
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:28,972
Yikes.

570
00:38:30,724 --> 00:38:33,059
<i>FBI's here, claiming jurisdiction.</i>

571
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:34,102
Where are they?

572
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,652
Can I help you?

573
00:38:44,696 --> 00:38:48,658
Special Agent Kirby Reed, FBI.
I work out of the Atlanta office.

574
00:38:48,742 --> 00:38:49,951
Oh. You lost?

575
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,914
Your two vics were residents of my city
before they moved here for college.

576
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:57,041
I have been investigating
their online activity

577
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,668
for the past few months.

578
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:01,880
Wow.

579
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,048
Why?

580
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:06,134
I take a special interest
in Ghostface attacks.

581
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,928
-Kirby?
-Hey, Sam.

582
00:39:09,304 --> 00:39:10,305
What?

583
00:39:11,014 --> 00:39:12,015
Tara.

584
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:13,975
You're the FBI?

585
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,728
-You guys know each other?
-Yeah.

586
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:20,232
We went to Woodsboro High together.
She was a senior when I was a freshman.

587
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,734
We share a certain history, yeah.

588
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:27,071
I'm not trying to get into
a jurisdictional pissing contest here,

589
00:39:27,155 --> 00:39:28,406
I just want to help.

590
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:31,492
I'll show you mine... et cetera.

591
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,247
Thank you.

592
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,041
He left this mask at the bodega.

593
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,251
DNA traces of two individuals,

594
00:39:40,335 --> 00:39:43,004
Charlie Walker, Jill Roberts,
both deceased.

595
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,341
The Ghostface killers of 2011.

596
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,095
Charlie Walker gave me this.

597
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,347
Like I said, I take a special interest.

598
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,975
Is this the mask he was wearing
when he attacked you?

599
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:56,935
No.

600
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:59,187
So he's leaving them on purpose.

601
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:02,941
Which means whoever's doing this is
a student of the killers who came before.

602
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,444
Maybe he believes
Sam is the latest in a long line.

603
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,280
Yeah, good luck with that.

604
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,989
We're getting out of town.

605
00:40:10,073 --> 00:40:11,866
I'm sorry, that's not possible.

606
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,287
You're both persons of interest
in a double homicide,

607
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,330
so you're not allowed to leave town.
Sorry.

608
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:19,541
-Are you serious?
-He's right.

609
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,169
-But if we work together--
-We're going.

610
00:40:25,797 --> 00:40:26,839
Here they come.

611
00:40:27,507 --> 00:40:30,384
Samantha, do you have an alibi
for last night's murders?

612
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,429
Tara, do you feel safe around your sister?

613
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,639
Tara! Tara!

614
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,433
Gale Weathers, Channel 4.

615
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:39,018
Do you ladies think you're the reason

616
00:40:39,102 --> 00:40:40,978
the Ghostface killer has come
to the Big Apple?

617
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,153
Nice try, sweetie,
but I've done this dance before.

618
00:40:51,698 --> 00:40:53,199
-Stay away from us.
-Samantha!

619
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,619
Are you still mad at me?

620
00:40:55,702 --> 00:40:58,413
You said you wouldn't write a book
about what happened.

621
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,081
And then you wrote a book
about what happened.

622
00:41:00,165 --> 00:41:01,166
Oh, come on.

623
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:04,126
Somebody was gonna write about it!
It's what I do.

624
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,921
I heard you couldn't sell
the movie rights.

625
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,591
It's all about true-crime limited series
these days.

626
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,593
After everything we went through together.

627
00:41:12,427 --> 00:41:13,428
What would Dewey think?

628
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,891
-That's a low blow.
-So was your book.

629
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:21,144
You called me "unstable"
and a "born killer".

630
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,230
That's taken out of context.

631
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:24,439
That's literally a quote.

632
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,483
You don't think what you wrote
has something to do with

633
00:41:26,566 --> 00:41:28,109
what's happening to us?

634
00:41:28,193 --> 00:41:29,569
Come on.

635
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:32,030
Hey, I talked to Sidney.

636
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,035
-She's not coming here, is she?
-No.

637
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,830
She sends her love, but she's taking Mark
and the kids someplace safe.

638
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,625
She deserves to have her happy ending.

639
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,962
On that much, we agree.

640
00:41:48,296 --> 00:41:51,007
Hey, I want to catch this fucker
as much as you do!

641
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,092
Maybe.

642
00:41:53,051 --> 00:41:55,303
Or maybe you're just afraid
that without Ghostface in your life,

643
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,888
you're gonna fade away.

644
00:42:04,229 --> 00:42:06,397
You fools! You're in danger!

645
00:42:06,481 --> 00:42:10,818
Can't you see? They're after you!
They're after all of us!

646
00:42:10,902 --> 00:42:13,237
Our wives, our children, everyone!

647
00:42:13,321 --> 00:42:16,782
They're here already! You're next!

648
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:22,076
You're next! You're next! You're next!
You're next!

649
00:42:31,673 --> 00:42:32,674
Who is it?

650
00:42:49,524 --> 00:42:53,194
You're a day early for trick-or-treating,
you know.

651
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,778
Okay, nerds, listen up!

652
00:43:36,446 --> 00:43:38,239
As terrifying as this all is,

653
00:43:38,323 --> 00:43:40,491
I'm actually glad I get a chance
to redeem myself

654
00:43:40,575 --> 00:43:43,244
for not calling the killers last time.

655
00:43:43,745 --> 00:43:45,913
-Yep.
-It's fine. Okay.

656
00:43:45,997 --> 00:43:49,667
The way I see it, someone is out
to make a sequel to the requel.

657
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:51,336
What's a requel?

658
00:43:52,045 --> 00:43:54,505
You're beautiful, sweetie.
Let's hold questions to the end.

659
00:43:54,589 --> 00:43:56,424
Stab 7 took place in Woodsboro.

660
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,386
Stab 2 took place in college.

661
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:01,762
So we think that the killer is trying
to copy the movies?

662
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,348
That is one possibility.

663
00:44:03,431 --> 00:44:05,558
Heroes now in college: Check.

664
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:08,478
Suspicious new characters brought in
to round out the suspect list

665
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,563
and/or body count:

666
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:11,731
-Check, check and check.
-I don't like this.

667
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,234
<i>-But it can't just be about Stab 2.
-Why not?</i>

668
00:44:14,317 --> 00:44:17,028
It would make sense
if this were just a sequel.

669
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:20,657
But we're not in a sequel,
because nobody just makes sequels anymore.

670
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:24,785
We're in a franchise!

671
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:28,373
And there are certain rules
to a continuing franchise.

672
00:44:28,456 --> 00:44:30,499
-I had a feeling.
-Rule one:

673
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,210
Everything is bigger than last time.

674
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:35,213
Bigger budget, bigger cast,
bigger body count.

675
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,090
Longer chases, shoot-outs, beheadings.

676
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,176
You got to top what came before
to keep people coming back.

677
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,219
-Beheadings?
-Beheadings.

678
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:44,764
Rule two: Whatever happened last time,
expect the opposite.

679
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,809
Franchises only survive
by subverting expectations.

680
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,979
If the killers last time
were whiny snowflake film nerds

681
00:44:51,062 --> 00:44:53,064
with Letterboxd accounts
instead of personalities,

682
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,608
you can bet
the opposite will be true here.

683
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,736
And rule three: No one is safe.

684
00:44:59,654 --> 00:45:02,239
Legacy characters?
Cannon fodder at this point.

685
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:06,536
Usually brought back only to be killed off
in some cheap bid for nostalgia.

686
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,247
It's not looking too good
for Gale and Kirby.

687
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,416
Oh, and that's not even the worst part!

688
00:45:11,499 --> 00:45:13,584
This is the part
where she tells us the worst part.

689
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:15,169
The worst part is,

690
00:45:15,253 --> 00:45:19,753
franchises are just continuing episodic
installments designed to boost an IP.

691
00:45:20,425 --> 00:45:24,887
Which means main characters
are completely expendable now, too.

692
00:45:24,971 --> 00:45:28,349
Laurie Strode, Nancy Thompson,
Ellen Ripley,

693
00:45:28,433 --> 00:45:31,269
Sally Hardesty, Jigsaw, Tony Stark,
James Bond...

694
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:35,690
I mean, even Luke Skywalker! All died
so their franchises could live on.

695
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,234
That means it's not just the friend group.

696
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:41,070
Any of us could go at any time,

697
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,657
especially Sam and Tara.

698
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,994
-Wait, any of us?
-Yeah.

699
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,789
-Am I in the friend group?
-Yeah.

700
00:45:50,872 --> 00:45:53,082
Am I one of the targets?

701
00:45:54,542 --> 00:45:56,043
Am I gonna die a virgin?

702
00:45:57,879 --> 00:45:59,422
That was a weird over share.

703
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,674
But it brings us to our current suspects:

704
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,301
Ethan.

705
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:07,013
The shy, dorky guy who no one suspects
because he's so shy and dorky.

706
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:11,101
Why am I on the suspect list?
Because I'm randomly Chad's roommate?

707
00:46:11,184 --> 00:46:13,019
Roommate lotteries can be juked.

708
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,271
You could have fixed it to get next to us.

709
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,522
Quinn.

710
00:46:16,606 --> 00:46:19,775
The slutty roommate.
A horror movie classic.

711
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:22,611
"Sex positive," but thank you?

712
00:46:23,905 --> 00:46:25,781
How did you come to live
with Sam and Tara?

713
00:46:25,865 --> 00:46:28,075
I answered their ad online.

714
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:31,537
Okay, say no more.
You've already implicated yourself enough.

715
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:33,289
It was an anonymous ad, Mindy.

716
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,625
And you know we vetted her.
Plus her dad is a cop.

717
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,585
And that makes it more likely
that she's the killer,

718
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,295
because having a cop dad is a great cover.

719
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,672
Do you not remember
how these movies work, Tara?

720
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:44,216
Is she always like this?

721
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,428
And finally, Anika.

722
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,557
Never trust the love interest.

723
00:46:53,351 --> 00:46:57,605
Okay! So, we have our rules
and we have our suspects.

724
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,399
But wait. What about you guys?

725
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,777
I think it's pretty safe to rule out
the four of us

726
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,487
who went through this last year
in Woodsboro.

727
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,282
-Agreed.
-Not agreed.

728
00:47:07,365 --> 00:47:11,865
What if the trauma you all went through
caused one or more of you to snap?

729
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,997
Yeah, or the fame you got
from the killings

730
00:47:15,081 --> 00:47:16,540
made you thirsty for more.

731
00:47:16,624 --> 00:47:20,586
I mean, let's be honest here, some
of the theories online about Sam are--

732
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,213
Don't you fucking dare.

733
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,049
Okay, she's right, though.

734
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,134
I mean, face facts,

735
00:47:26,217 --> 00:47:28,302
if we're all suspects,
you're all suspects.

736
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,732
Remember Samantha Carpenter's alibi,
the therapist?

737
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,901
He was stabbed to death. Through the nose.

738
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,447
Through the nose. How messed up is that?

739
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:48,989
It's pretty messed up.

740
00:47:50,116 --> 00:47:53,452
He turned her in for making
threatening remarks, ended up dead.

741
00:47:53,953 --> 00:47:56,080
And guess which patient's
notes were stolen?

742
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:00,335
So Sam kills her own alibi
and steals her own session notes?

743
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,086
Maybe.

744
00:48:03,296 --> 00:48:04,714
Another mask was found at the scene.

745
00:48:05,715 --> 00:48:07,425
It's a DNA match for Roman Bridger.

746
00:48:08,009 --> 00:48:10,344
The Ghostface who was directing Stab 3.

747
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:15,016
It's like he's leaving us
real-life franchise Easter eggs.

748
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,311
Like dropping
the killers' masks in reverse.

749
00:48:19,312 --> 00:48:21,314
Almost like he's counting down
to something.

750
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,025
What happens when he gets to one?

751
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:32,117
So we've had
nine Ghostface killers so far.

752
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,576
Nine. But I thought in the movies--

753
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,536
Forget about the movies.
The movies don't matter.

754
00:48:36,704 --> 00:48:39,707
Look. Last year
was Amber Freeman and Richie Kirsch,

755
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,667
whose masks we found
at the first crime scene

756
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:45,254
along with the bodies of two film students
who killed their professor

757
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:46,464
earlier the same night.

758
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:51,260
Then it was Jill Roberts
and Charlie Walker-- theirs at the bodega.

759
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:53,929
Roman Bridger was the only
single Ghostface.

760
00:48:54,013 --> 00:48:55,389
Kudos to him for ambition.

761
00:48:55,473 --> 00:48:57,766
His mask was found at the shrink's.

762
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:01,437
Which just leaves Mickey Altieri,
Nancy Loomis, Stu Macher...

763
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,898
...and Billy Loomis. Number one.

764
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,942
And the father of our chief suspect.

765
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:10,780
Well, whoever's doing this
is leading us back to Sam.

766
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,077
I will check in later.

767
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,204
And tell your daughter to stay sharp.

768
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:21,165
Proximity to the Carpenters
is proximity to Ghostface.

769
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,970
Hey, Jack?
Would you call the Atlanta field office?

770
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,973
Dig up what you can on Agent Reed.

771
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,356
I think you should get out of the city.

772
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,817
You know, considering what happened
to you last time.

773
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,612
I wouldn't blame you if...

774
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:53,072
you wanted to go.

775
00:49:55,658 --> 00:49:57,910
That's very thoughtful of you...

776
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,748
but I don't think I'm going anywhere.

777
00:50:02,832 --> 00:50:04,542
Will you two just make out already?

778
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:07,086
-That is so inappropriate, dude.
-Oh, whatever.

779
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:08,796
Get it over with!

780
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,881
Here you go.

781
00:50:09,964 --> 00:50:11,006
-Sam?
-Yep?

782
00:50:11,674 --> 00:50:13,258
We do not have to stay here.

783
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,929
Well, too bad. I insist.
Safety in numbers.

784
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:20,057
This'll be so fun.
A little slumber party with the Core Four!

785
00:50:20,141 --> 00:50:21,559
-"Core Four"?
-Yeah.

786
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,478
-Did you just give us a nickname?
-I sure did.

787
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:26,730
We've been through a lot together,
and it's a pretty cool nickname.

788
00:50:26,814 --> 00:50:28,440
-That's debatable.
-It's extremely debatable.

789
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,276
You can't just
give yourself a nickname, dingus.

790
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,695
Of course I can, dingus,
because I just did.

791
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,822
-Core Four, up top!
-No.

792
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,198
-Down low.
-Get that away.

793
00:50:36,282 --> 00:50:38,575
-Please, for the love of God.
-Don't do it.

794
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,287
I would like a little more respect
and support

795
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,581
from my fellow members of the Core Four.

796
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,126
-Guys! What the hell?
-We're hearing from sources...

797
00:50:48,127 --> 00:50:49,628
...Inside the homicide division

798
00:50:49,712 --> 00:50:53,716
that the prime suspect is none other
than Samantha Carpenter,

799
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,261
one of the survivors
of the Woodsboro killings in 2022,

800
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:00,806
seen here attacking
a woman on the street last night.

801
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,433
<i>**** is wrong with you?</i>

802
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:05,144
You got a problem with me? Knock it off!

803
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,230
You guys should stay away from her.
She knows what she did.

804
00:51:07,313 --> 00:51:11,400
<i>In the wake of the Woodsboro tragedy
last year, rumors sprouted online</i>

805
00:51:11,484 --> 00:51:15,029
that Carpenter
was actually responsible for the killings,

806
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:17,865
blaming the crimes on her boyfriend,
Richie Kirsch

807
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,200
and teen Amber Free--

808
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,143
I know you're not a fan of the way
that I've been handling things

809
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,812
and that I've been giving you
a really hard time.

810
00:51:47,895 --> 00:51:48,896
But I can say that...

811
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,900
none of us can relate
to what you are experiencing.

812
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,948
And I'm really, really sorry
that you have to do that alone.

813
00:52:03,953 --> 00:52:05,162
It's not your fault.

814
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,667
And I know I shouldn't care
what people think.

815
00:52:11,836 --> 00:52:14,672
It just sucks being this hated.

816
00:52:17,216 --> 00:52:20,260
Hey. Just a reminder,

817
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:23,514
not a single person
in this room hates you.

818
00:52:24,098 --> 00:52:27,601
Okay? We have all been through
some fucked-up stuff,

819
00:52:27,685 --> 00:52:29,561
and we are coping with it differently.

820
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:34,442
But we moved here together
for one very specific reason.

821
00:52:37,236 --> 00:52:38,278
We are a team.

822
00:52:42,408 --> 00:52:45,285
We are the Core Fucking Four.

823
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,372
-Thank you very much. Absolutely right.
- I hate myself.

824
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:49,707
-You said it.
-That is what I'm talking about.

825
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,334
It's the Core Four.

826
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:53,460
-Say it.
-No, I'm not gonna say it. Not now.

827
00:52:53,544 --> 00:52:56,296
-I mean, yes, we're a team, but...
-It's got a nice ring to it.

828
00:52:57,423 --> 00:52:59,842
I've been sleeping with Cute Boy
from across the hall.

829
00:53:03,429 --> 00:53:05,180
-Boom!
- fucking knew it!

830
00:53:05,264 --> 00:53:07,683
-I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.
-You called it.

831
00:53:08,434 --> 00:53:10,144
I knew it from the day
you had that hickey.

832
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,940
Sales of the Ghostface Halloween mask
across the tri-state area...

833
00:53:16,567 --> 00:53:18,902
...In the last 24 hours
have gone through the roof.

834
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,989
<i>-I've got my mask. What about you?
-You know it.</i>

835
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,617
-It's gonna be one spooky Halloween.
- I'll say.

836
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,619
Now let's get over to Guy
for a look at our weather.

837
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:31,707
Yeah, I know she's my roommate,
but you're, like, the police.

838
00:53:36,337 --> 00:53:37,838
-No, I know.
-Hey!

839
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,925
Fuck.

840
00:53:41,008 --> 00:53:42,884
Hey, yeah. Wassup, bitch?

841
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,054
I see you, motherfucker!

842
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,474
<i>Sam! Samantha!</i>

843
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,768
I feel like we should high five
or something.

844
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,979
-The Core Four high five, may we, please?
-Don't call it that,

845
00:53:53,062 --> 00:53:54,938
but we'll do the high five.

846
00:53:55,022 --> 00:53:56,523
-Come on.
-Keep going.

847
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,691
That's gross.

848
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,278
Sam, what the fuck?

849
00:54:01,362 --> 00:54:03,822
She's really freaked out and paranoid.

850
00:54:03,906 --> 00:54:06,283
-Babe, you gonna join me?
-Hang on.

851
00:54:06,367 --> 00:54:10,454
No. And don't use my good face wash.
It's pH-balanced for women.

852
00:54:11,497 --> 00:54:12,915
Pick up your phone, baby.

853
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:16,836
No way.

854
00:54:16,919 --> 00:54:18,003
Is that him?

855
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:22,049
-No, Tara. Not right now.
-Hey, so what are your intentions?

856
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,509
Yeah, that's right.

857
00:54:24,093 --> 00:54:26,428
It's fine. I'll call him back.

858
00:54:26,512 --> 00:54:27,471
Poor guy.

859
00:54:30,808 --> 00:54:33,435
Quinn and her gentleman caller
are back at it again.

860
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:35,395
She's getting it, too? Okay.

861
00:54:52,246 --> 00:54:53,830
Help! Stop!

862
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:56,792
Tara, wait, wait!

863
00:55:06,427 --> 00:55:07,428
Run.

864
00:55:12,975 --> 00:55:14,226
Guys, come on!

865
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:17,062
Oh, fuck.

866
00:55:18,731 --> 00:55:19,606
Mindy!

867
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,233
Stay the fuck back!

868
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,842
Hey!

869
00:55:50,721 --> 00:55:51,722
Wait, Chad!

870
00:55:52,431 --> 00:55:53,765
-They're still up there.
-Shit!

871
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,441
Fuck.

872
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:05,695
Sam!

873
00:56:05,778 --> 00:56:08,614
-Do you have the keys?
- left them inside!

874
00:56:17,206 --> 00:56:19,416
Mindy, bathroom door. Hurry!

875
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:23,754
Oh, fuck! That guy's dead.

876
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,027
Oh, shit.

877
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,320
Oh, fuck.

878
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:50,948
Hey!

879
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,703
Hey!

880
00:56:57,788 --> 00:56:58,872
Shit.

881
00:57:02,376 --> 00:57:03,960
Don't worry, I got you.

882
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,923
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-You have a better idea?

883
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,008
Fuck. No.

884
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,100
You have to come one at a time.

885
00:57:19,143 --> 00:57:21,436
-You two go first. Mindy!
-What? No.

886
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,356
Someone needs to hold the door.
I'll send Anika next. Go!

887
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,860
Sam, come on. Eyes on me, baby.

888
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,321
Keep your eyes on me.

889
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:32,782
Oh, shit.

890
00:57:33,991 --> 00:57:36,493
-Oh, my God.
-I got you, baby, I got you.

891
00:57:39,455 --> 00:57:40,747
Baby, come on!

892
00:57:41,832 --> 00:57:42,833
It won't hold me.

893
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:44,584
Okay.

894
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:46,754
It ain't going anywhere.
It's gonna hold you, I promise.

895
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:48,464
Danny.

896
00:57:52,468 --> 00:57:54,720
I got you.
You ain't going nowhere. Let's go.

897
00:57:55,304 --> 00:57:58,765
-She's losing a lot of blood!
-Say something more positive!

898
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,268
Eyes on me, Sam. Come on, baby.

899
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:04,688
Come on, baby. I got you.

900
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,231
Come on, I got you.

901
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,445
Okay.

902
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:12,947
-Come on!
-Let's go!

903
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,282
-Come on, Mindy!
-Let's go, we got to move!

904
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,784
Anika, come on!

905
00:58:18,577 --> 00:58:21,079
-Anika!
-Go! Come on!

906
00:58:21,163 --> 00:58:23,165
-You have to go first.
- I can't.

907
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,584
Look at me. You have to go.

908
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,253
Mindy, no!
I'll be right behind you, I promise.

909
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,885
Mindy, come on. You got to get over here!

910
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,095
Let's go!

911
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,265
-We got you.
-That's it. Mindy.

912
00:58:40,224 --> 00:58:41,850
-Slow and steady.
-We got you.

913
00:58:42,935 --> 00:58:44,311
Oh, God.

914
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,521
Let's go.

915
00:58:45,604 --> 00:58:48,607
-Good job, baby, you gotta go.
-Get over here right now!

916
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:51,568
Anika's coming right behind you.

917
00:58:55,781 --> 00:58:58,450
-Anika, come on!
-Go!

918
00:58:58,534 --> 00:59:00,994
-You can do it!
-Come on, Anika!

919
00:59:01,078 --> 00:59:04,206
Oh, God! I can't do it, I can't do it.

920
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:07,584
-Don't look down!
-Look at me!!

921
00:59:08,335 --> 00:59:11,004
You can do it! You're doing good.

922
00:59:17,553 --> 00:59:18,637
What?

923
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,681
Anika, you have to move right now!

924
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,476
No, God! Please, no!

925
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,686
Anika, you got to move!

926
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,148
No!

927
00:59:35,988 --> 00:59:37,406
You have to make it!

928
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:40,034
Baby, I don't want to die!

929
00:59:40,117 --> 00:59:41,118
No, Anika.

930
00:59:45,122 --> 00:59:47,415
Anika, give me your hand. I got you.

931
01:00:34,588 --> 01:00:36,381
Hey. You okay?

932
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:42,429
This isn't your fault, Sam.

933
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:44,807
But it is.

934
01:00:49,895 --> 01:00:51,646
Someone took our knives,

935
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,107
so we couldn't fight back.

936
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,610
I don't know who I can trust.

937
01:00:59,071 --> 01:01:02,324
Then don't trust anyone.
Not your friends. Not me.

938
01:01:03,492 --> 01:01:04,534
Not anyone.

939
01:01:05,035 --> 01:01:06,828
I have a few more questions for you.

940
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,374
Just this way, Danny.

941
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:18,716
Chad.

942
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,554
-Where were you?
-What? When?

943
01:01:23,637 --> 01:01:26,014
-Last night!
-What? I had Econ. You know this.

944
01:01:26,098 --> 01:01:28,475
Bullshit, man! You disappear,
and my sister almost gets killed!

945
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:32,104
Dude, I was in a study hall with a hundred
other people. You can ask any of them.

946
01:01:33,689 --> 01:01:34,690
Fuck, man.

947
01:01:36,483 --> 01:01:37,567
Oh, my God.

948
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,821
-Who?
-Anika and Quinn.

949
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,950
Mindy, I'm so sorry.

950
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,535
Step the fuck back.

951
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,872
You're at the top of my list.

952
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:51,874
I had Econ!

953
01:02:00,382 --> 01:02:03,134
-You can see the exit wound here.
-Go right ahead, sir.

954
01:02:08,265 --> 01:02:09,391
I'm gonna be right back.

955
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:18,650
I'm really sorry about Quinn.

956
01:02:20,277 --> 01:02:21,653
Thank you.

957
01:02:24,406 --> 01:02:25,657
Both my kids are gone.

958
01:02:27,117 --> 01:02:28,284
My whole family

959
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:30,204
is gone.

960
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,377
They took me off the case.

961
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:39,171
But I'm not gonna stop until I find him.

962
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,590
You fuck with my family...

963
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,051
you die.

964
01:02:45,469 --> 01:02:46,470
Agreed.

965
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,723
Hey, are you okay?
I came as soon as I heard.

966
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,266
Gale, I swear to God...

967
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,144
Truce, okay?
I'm here for whatever you need.

968
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:55,437
Okay. Nice try.

969
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:56,980
Really, I am.

970
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:00,025
Okay, fine. Off the record, okay?

971
01:03:03,904 --> 01:03:05,697
Okay. Thank you.

972
01:03:10,035 --> 01:03:11,995
I'm sorry I punched you.

973
01:03:12,746 --> 01:03:14,080
No, you're not.

974
01:03:14,164 --> 01:03:15,165
I'm not.

975
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:18,710
You're the cop, right?

976
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:22,548
I did some digging on your
first two victims and I found something.

977
01:03:22,631 --> 01:03:25,091
I know where the masks are coming from.

978
01:03:25,175 --> 01:03:26,551
Show me.

979
01:03:26,635 --> 01:03:27,510
Ladies.

980
01:03:28,595 --> 01:03:29,762
Kirby?

981
01:03:30,597 --> 01:03:31,598
Gale.

982
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:33,934
-She's with the FBI.
-She's a child.

983
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:36,270
When did they start letting children
into the FBI?

984
01:03:36,895 --> 01:03:39,188
-I'm 30.
-Well, you look like a zygote.

985
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,482
I have a gun, Gale.

986
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:43,360
Okay, fine.
You're gonna want to see this, too.

987
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:48,699
Jason and Greg
were little Atlanta rich boys.

988
01:03:48,782 --> 01:03:51,451
Apparently,
they used fake names to rent this place.

989
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:52,536
How did you find it?

990
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,998
It's called "investigative journalism"
for a reason.

991
01:03:56,498 --> 01:03:59,876
How didn't you find it?
Weren't you tracking them?

992
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,837
I went through
their financial records dozens of times.

993
01:04:02,921 --> 01:04:05,840
This was not in any of them.
Doesn't make sense.

994
01:04:05,924 --> 01:04:09,218
Don't worry. I'm just really good
at my job. You'll get there.

995
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:25,402
What is this place?
What's with all the security?

996
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:30,616
It's a movie theater.

997
01:04:31,575 --> 01:04:32,576
It's not just a theater.

998
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:34,870
It's a shrine.

999
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,614
They've got the whole goddamn franchise.

1000
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,256
Chad?

1001
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:29,799
This was Uncle Randy's.

1002
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,385
They've got everything.

1003
01:05:35,722 --> 01:05:37,515
-Is that--
-The knife I was stabbed with.

1004
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,018
You all have been through so much.

1005
01:05:41,478 --> 01:05:43,605
Who drew all these?

1006
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,413
Dewey.

1007
01:05:59,496 --> 01:06:00,955
How'd they get all this stuff?

1008
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:03,583
Isn't this evidence?

1009
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:08,167
Well, cops like money,
and evidence can get lost pretty easily.

1010
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,759
Present company excluded, of course.

1011
01:06:15,804 --> 01:06:18,431
Why am I here exactly?
My alibi checks out.

1012
01:06:18,515 --> 01:06:21,100
So I can keep an eye on you, roomie.

1013
01:06:22,227 --> 01:06:25,521
The killer must have found this place
before he murdered Jason and Greg.

1014
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:28,650
And then he took the masks
off the mannequins.

1015
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:31,862
All nine, from Stu and Billy
to Amber and Richie.

1016
01:06:57,596 --> 01:07:00,807
Hot damn! How fucking cool is this place?

1017
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:02,225
Fuck, no.

1018
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:03,393
Fuck, yes.

1019
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:08,189
Come on, Sam, you got to be excited
to get our murder on again. Together.

1020
01:07:08,273 --> 01:07:10,900
Billy and Sam. Team Loomis.

1021
01:07:11,985 --> 01:07:14,070
Get ready to slice up more motherfuckers.

1022
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:26,250
What are you doing?

1023
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:32,630
I don't know.

1024
01:07:37,135 --> 01:07:38,219
So,

1025
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:41,181
somebody killed these chuckle fucks

1026
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:43,933
and took over?

1027
01:07:44,017 --> 01:07:46,644
Someone who believes
that Sam masterminded Woodsboro.

1028
01:07:46,728 --> 01:07:49,981
If this were a normal Stab movie,
this would be the killer's lair.

1029
01:07:50,482 --> 01:07:52,734
<i>Which means
this isn't a normal Stab movie.</i>

1030
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:11,586
The TV that killed Stu Macher.

1031
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,254
If you believe he's dead.

1032
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,259
I hear you're a horror fan.

1033
01:08:18,093 --> 01:08:19,344
It's been said.

1034
01:08:20,929 --> 01:08:22,847
Best Nightmare on Elm Street?

1035
01:08:22,931 --> 01:08:23,932
The original.

1036
01:08:24,516 --> 01:08:26,309
Best Friday the 13th?

1037
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:27,644
<i>-Part II.
-The Final Chapter.</i>

1038
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:30,772
Had a crush on Corey Feldman.

1039
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:32,524
Okay. Respect.

1040
01:08:33,817 --> 01:08:34,818
<i>Psycho II </i> is...

1041
01:08:34,901 --> 01:08:36,027
-underrated.
-underrated.

1042
01:08:37,237 --> 01:08:40,156
Candyman. The original or requel?

1043
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,157
-Both.
-Both.

1044
01:08:42,659 --> 01:08:44,827
Okay. Okay.

1045
01:08:44,911 --> 01:08:46,495
Game recognize game.

1046
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:54,713
You okay?

1047
01:08:57,966 --> 01:09:00,259
Sam, when do I get
to be a normal person again?

1048
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:04,348
I don't know.

1049
01:09:04,931 --> 01:09:06,599
I don't want to be a part of this.

1050
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:10,186
I don't want to be a part
of some stupid legacy because I'm--

1051
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:11,396
Because of me.

1052
01:09:14,107 --> 01:09:15,108
I'm sorry.

1053
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,569
Just drop it, Sam.

1054
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:20,447
Tara.

1055
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:22,324
I got her.

1056
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,747
That seemed intense.

1057
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:32,751
Ever since I came back into her life,
I've just...

1058
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,089
made a mess of it.

1059
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:38,674
Hey.

1060
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,341
Where's your mother in all this?

1061
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:44,095
She cut me off
when I told Tara about Billy.

1062
01:09:45,013 --> 01:09:48,349
Then Tara cut her off
because she wouldn't talk to me,

1063
01:09:49,184 --> 01:09:51,477
SO now neither of us have a mother.

1064
01:09:51,561 --> 01:09:53,896
I'm sorry to say this, but fuck her.

1065
01:09:54,731 --> 01:09:56,149
My parents sucked, too.

1066
01:09:57,984 --> 01:09:59,986
But you can still make your own family.

1067
01:10:00,862 --> 01:10:02,697
Even if it's just with one person.

1068
01:10:06,868 --> 01:10:08,828
And if you lose that one person?

1069
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:12,832
You just keep going.

1070
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:17,545
And maybe you find another loner,
and you look after each other.

1071
01:10:26,054 --> 01:10:28,014
How'd you get past what happened to you?

1072
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:35,355
I almost died after I was stabbed.

1073
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:38,691
Technically, I did die.

1074
01:10:38,775 --> 01:10:40,276
For four minutes.

1075
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:44,572
When I recovered...

1076
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:47,409
I got mad.

1077
01:10:48,326 --> 01:10:51,495
I didn't want to spend the rest
of my life being afraid of monsters.

1078
01:10:53,248 --> 01:10:55,750
I wanted the monsters to be afraid of me.

1079
01:10:57,043 --> 01:10:58,377
I like that.

1080
01:10:59,337 --> 01:11:00,629
Sorry to interrupt.

1081
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:04,884
Think I might have an idea about how
to turn the tables on this creep.

1082
01:11:04,968 --> 01:11:05,969
Yeah. We're in.

1083
01:11:06,678 --> 01:11:08,638
Sorry, Gale. No press allowed.

1084
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:10,849
Police business. I'm good at my job, too.

1085
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,274
You should have stayed with the others.

1086
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:20,901
That's not gonna happen.

1087
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:24,654
There's no point in both of us
putting ourselves at risk.

1088
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:27,240
I'm not. I'm your backup.

1089
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:35,665
So we're really doing the phone tracing
thing that never works in the movies.

1090
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:38,835
It'll be all, "Keep him talking, Sam.
Two more minutes, I've almost got him."

1091
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:41,504
And then he hangs up just
before we can get a lock.

1092
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:45,049
I can trace a call in under 15 seconds.

1093
01:11:47,427 --> 01:11:50,430
Well, you've got them out there as bait.

1094
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:52,599
Because the killer usually calls
from somewhere nearby.

1095
01:11:52,682 --> 01:11:55,976
And you think they're safe because
it's broad daylight in a public place?

1096
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:58,396
Look, I am here, okay? And so is Bailey.

1097
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,107
This is exactly how our Uncle Randy died.

1098
01:12:01,191 --> 01:12:02,901
Broad daylight. Public place.

1099
01:12:02,984 --> 01:12:05,903
Yanked into a van.
Stab, stab, stab. No more Randy.

1100
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:15,038
Hey, Sam? Stay frosty out there, okay?

1101
01:12:15,121 --> 01:12:16,122
We're good.

1102
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:43,232
-You're gonna die, you know.
-No, you're gonna die, Samantha!

1103
01:12:43,316 --> 01:12:46,902
Choking on your own blood
while I hack up your sister.

1104
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,614
Unless we find you first.

1105
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:52,826
For a mastermind, you're not very bright.

1106
01:12:52,909 --> 01:12:57,330
Waiting for me to call, desperately hoping
I'm nearby so the police can grab me?

1107
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:03,378
But I'm not nearby. I'm a step ahead.

1108
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:06,214
Be seeing you, Samantha.

1109
01:13:08,174 --> 01:13:09,049
Did you get it?

1110
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:12,387
Yep. Geolocation coming through right now.

1111
01:13:14,389 --> 01:13:15,890
He's on the Upper West Side.

1112
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:19,227
He's inside an apartment building,
halfway across the city.

1113
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:21,730
-On West 96th?
-How did you know that?

1114
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:26,776
Gale.

1115
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:29,696
"No press."

1116
01:13:29,779 --> 01:13:32,948
Bitch, last time I saw you,
you were in glee club.

1117
01:13:33,617 --> 01:13:35,994
Forgive me if I don't trust you
to keep them safe.

1118
01:13:36,077 --> 01:13:37,787
-Here you go, baby.
-Thanks.

1119
01:13:38,538 --> 01:13:41,374
My friend Danny works on the
Upper West Side. He can get there quicker.

1120
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:44,419
Yeah, or he could finish her off.
Is it possible he's the killer?

1121
01:13:44,502 --> 01:13:46,170
Fuck. We have to get there now.

1122
01:13:46,254 --> 01:13:48,464
It's 50 blocks away. We don't even know
if it's true. Sam, wait!

1123
01:13:48,548 --> 01:13:50,132
-Take a minute.
-We don't have a minute.

1124
01:13:50,216 --> 01:13:52,092
You have to trust me,
we got to make the right call.

1125
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:53,636
-He's already--
-Sam!

1126
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:55,471
Get in.

1127
01:13:55,555 --> 01:13:56,722
What's she doing?

1128
01:13:56,806 --> 01:13:58,682
Hey, get out of my car!

1129
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:01,561
What do you think you're doing?
That's an official vehicle!

1130
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:02,646
Should we use the sirens?

1131
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:05,189
Did you think we'd steal a police car
and not use the sirens?

1132
01:14:05,273 --> 01:14:06,857
-Do you even have a license?
-Fuck, yeah.

1133
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:08,193
What are you doing?

1134
01:14:09,069 --> 01:14:11,654
It's a cop car! You can't steal a cop car!

1135
01:14:14,824 --> 01:14:15,950
That'll be our food.

1136
01:14:18,745 --> 01:14:19,746
Hello?

1137
01:14:20,997 --> 01:14:22,456
Not the food. It's for you.

1138
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:24,625
Who is it?

1139
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:26,127
May I ask who's calling, please?

1140
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:29,505
He says it's the killer.

1141
01:14:37,013 --> 01:14:39,473
-Hello?
-Hello, Gale.

1142
01:14:39,557 --> 01:14:42,476
Strange that you and I have never spoken
on the phone.

1143
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:44,812
This is long overdue.

1144
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:46,398
I agree.

1145
01:14:46,898 --> 01:14:48,065
Call the police.

1146
01:14:48,149 --> 01:14:49,650
[ Figured after all these years...

1147
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:52,904
...you'd want an interview.

1148
01:14:53,571 --> 01:14:55,781
Well, you figured right.

1149
01:14:57,575 --> 01:14:59,618
So, what's your motive this time?

1150
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:03,706
You angry at the movies
or you just trying to stay relevant?

1151
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:05,917
I could ask you the same.

1152
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:09,546
Don't you know
the legacy characters are disposable now?

1153
01:15:09,629 --> 01:15:12,089
Nobody cares about last century's heroes.

1154
01:15:12,173 --> 01:15:15,509
-Then why bother with me at all?
-Call it nostalgia.

1155
01:15:15,593 --> 01:15:17,469
Or maybe you deserve to be punished

1156
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:20,098
for all that money you made
off the misery of others.

1157
01:15:20,598 --> 01:15:25,098
Maybe it's time
someone made a buck reporting your death.

1158
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,939
You know you're like the tenth guy
to try this, right?

1159
01:15:28,773 --> 01:15:30,065
And spoiler alert,

1160
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,736
it never works out for the dipshit
in the mask.

1161
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:38,574
Oh, but they certainly leave a mark
before they go, don't they?

1162
01:15:39,075 --> 01:15:42,203
Richie and Amber managed to butcher Dewey.

1163
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:44,998
Carved him up like a Christmas goose.

1164
01:15:45,498 --> 01:15:49,418
How does it feel to lose the only man
who ever loved you?

1165
01:15:49,502 --> 01:15:50,794
Fuck you!

1166
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:54,841
<i>How does it feel to know
that you weren't there for him at the end?</i>

1167
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,511
<i>Not there to give him comfort</i>

1168
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:01,139
as he died screaming in his own guts.

1169
01:16:01,222 --> 01:16:03,432
You're the one who's gonna die screaming.

1170
01:16:03,516 --> 01:16:07,019
<i>Maybe. But you won't be around to see it.</i>

1171
01:16:07,103 --> 01:16:09,313
<i>You couldn't stop what happened to Dewey.</i>

1172
01:16:09,397 --> 01:16:11,941
<i>Just like you're not gonna be able
to stop this.</i>

1173
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:49,520
Oh, God!

1174
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:16,673
How's that for nostalgia, fucker?

1175
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:30,770
You missed.

1176
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:32,647
Sure I did.

1177
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:35,649
You win. I'm in the elevator heading
for the ground floor.

1178
01:17:36,609 --> 01:17:37,860
Sure you are.

1179
01:17:41,739 --> 01:17:44,408
Maybe you did hit me. Maybe I'm wounded.

1180
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:47,745
<i>Or maybe I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.</i>

1181
01:17:48,246 --> 01:17:50,831
That's why I'm gonna shoot you
in the fucking head!

1182
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:06,347
You would've made a good killer, Gale.

1183
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:09,600
Sidney never would've made sense
and Dewey was the fan favorite.

1184
01:18:09,684 --> 01:18:12,061
But you cracking under the pressure

1185
01:18:12,145 --> 01:18:15,690
and turning into Ghostface
would've been a great twist.

1186
01:18:15,773 --> 01:18:17,316
Keep talking, asshole.

1187
01:18:18,651 --> 01:18:21,945
<i>Sure. What do you want to talk about?</i>

1188
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:27,452
You never got to be the leading lady,
did you?

1189
01:18:27,535 --> 01:18:32,035
It was always all about poor sweet Sidney,
sucking up all the oxygen.

1190
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:34,459
What did that leave you to be?

1191
01:18:34,959 --> 01:18:36,502
The brains and the sex appeal.

1192
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:39,588
Sorry about your boyfriend.

1193
01:18:40,256 --> 01:18:43,175
All those muscles didn't help much.

1194
01:18:43,259 --> 01:18:44,260
They sure didn't.

1195
01:18:47,388 --> 01:18:48,555
Can you hold, please?

1196
01:20:13,057 --> 01:20:14,308
Fuck you!

1197
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:15,810
Hey, fuckface!

1198
01:20:21,649 --> 01:20:23,192
Gale!

1199
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:25,736
Oh, shit. Gale?

1200
01:20:27,071 --> 01:20:28,280
Gale.

1201
01:20:30,241 --> 01:20:31,450
Sorry.

1202
01:20:31,534 --> 01:20:32,535
I'm sorry.

1203
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:36,163
I should've known
that he was gonna come after you.

1204
01:20:36,247 --> 01:20:37,331
I'm so sorry.

1205
01:20:39,292 --> 01:20:40,626
He didn't get me.

1206
01:20:43,254 --> 01:20:44,296
Tell Sidney

1207
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:46,966
he never got me.

1208
01:20:52,638 --> 01:20:53,639
Gale?

1209
01:20:56,309 --> 01:20:57,643
-Gale.
-Gale.

1210
01:20:57,727 --> 01:20:59,520
Gale? Please.

1211
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:00,646
Out of the way!

1212
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:03,983
-Out of the way!
-Move. You got to move. Move!

1213
01:21:04,067 --> 01:21:05,276
No! No!

1214
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:07,653
-Get them back.
-Sam, please!

1215
01:21:07,737 --> 01:21:09,989
-They need to move now.
-Please step back.

1216
01:21:11,115 --> 01:21:12,783
-Call it in.
-Right away.

1217
01:21:14,702 --> 01:21:16,537
-Checking.
-Come on, Gale.

1218
01:21:20,249 --> 01:21:22,417
Got a weak pulse. Get the backboard.

1219
01:21:22,502 --> 01:21:23,503
We need to move now.

1220
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:29,508
Backboard! Let's move.

1221
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:46,442
I got here as fast as I could.

1222
01:21:48,611 --> 01:21:49,820
Did you?

1223
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:53,282
I'm scared, you guys.

1224
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:55,242
I really don't want to get hurt again.

1225
01:21:56,285 --> 01:21:57,286
Neither do I.

1226
01:21:59,038 --> 01:22:00,622
I don't want you
getting hurt again, either.

1227
01:22:00,706 --> 01:22:02,541
I know. I know.

1228
01:22:08,631 --> 01:22:09,965
So what do we do now?

1229
01:22:11,884 --> 01:22:13,844
Maybe he gets to win this time.

1230
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:19,225
He wants to punish me.

1231
01:22:22,019 --> 01:22:23,020
Me.

1232
01:22:24,981 --> 01:22:26,273
So maybe I let him.

1233
01:22:27,358 --> 01:22:29,568
I'll just give myself up.

1234
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:32,697
If this is what I have to do

1235
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:35,324
to keep you safe...

1236
01:22:36,742 --> 01:22:37,743
it's worth it.

1237
01:22:37,827 --> 01:22:39,787
No, we're not doing that, Sam.

1238
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:42,248
You went back to Woodsboro to protect me.

1239
01:22:42,331 --> 01:22:44,833
Every single day,
you make the decision to protect me.

1240
01:22:44,917 --> 01:22:47,628
None of us would even be alive
if it weren't for you.

1241
01:22:48,379 --> 01:22:50,547
You have to let us protect you this time.

1242
01:22:51,215 --> 01:22:52,299
-No.
-Yes.

1243
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:55,303
We're a team, remember?

1244
01:22:55,386 --> 01:22:56,678
Actually...

1245
01:22:58,389 --> 01:22:59,390
we're a family.

1246
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:02,268
Let's go! Core Four! Come on.

1247
01:23:02,351 --> 01:23:03,894
-Core Four.
-Come on.

1248
01:23:03,978 --> 01:23:05,479
-Core what?
-It's an us thing.

1249
01:23:07,565 --> 01:23:09,441
He's gonna keep coming after us.

1250
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:12,945
Isn't there somewhere
that's safe we could just hole up in?

1251
01:23:13,029 --> 01:23:14,739
No, he's just gonna keep finding us.

1252
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:16,490
Great.

1253
01:23:18,951 --> 01:23:19,993
We could use that, though.

1254
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:25,832
I'm getting my ass chewed out
for not dropping the case

1255
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:27,043
and now you want me to do what?

1256
01:23:27,126 --> 01:23:29,711
We want to lure him to a secure location
and trap him inside.

1257
01:23:31,422 --> 01:23:32,631
And then what?

1258
01:23:33,716 --> 01:23:34,717
We execute him.

1259
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:41,557
Are you gonna help us?

1260
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:46,103
Let's kill the son of a bitch.

1261
01:23:46,854 --> 01:23:49,648
<i>Now, I'm stuck here, but Gale gave us
the key cards to the theater.</i>

1262
01:23:49,732 --> 01:23:53,569
It's got heavy surveillance and security
cameras, but we can use that against him.

1263
01:23:54,487 --> 01:23:57,198
[I tell Kirby to meet you there
and I'll join you as soon as I can.

1264
01:23:57,281 --> 01:23:59,825
-Got it.
-And remember, travel in public.

1265
01:23:59,909 --> 01:24:01,827
The more people around you,
the less chance he has

1266
01:24:01,911 --> 01:24:04,246
lo lake a shot at you
before you get there.

1267
01:24:10,461 --> 01:24:12,087
Is this even a good plan?

1268
01:24:12,171 --> 01:24:13,797
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

1269
01:24:13,881 --> 01:24:16,842
So we just peel off and the killer
picks us off one by one? No, thank you.

1270
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:19,262
Let's just get to the theater.
Come on, in here.

1271
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:23,182
Yes, because it'll be much less scary
at the serial killer movie theater.

1272
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:24,267
Fuck.

1273
01:24:25,434 --> 01:24:27,269
Wait, hey, hey! Chad!

1274
01:24:27,353 --> 01:24:28,979
Hey! Fuck! Chad!

1275
01:24:30,147 --> 01:24:31,148
<i>Tara!</i>

1276
01:24:32,817 --> 01:24:35,027
-Wait, where's Mindy?
-Chad! Sam! Hey, Sam!

1277
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:36,987
Mindy! Mindy! Mindy!

1278
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:40,157
Let's go. Shit.

1279
01:24:40,741 --> 01:24:41,992
Fuck!

1280
01:24:46,497 --> 01:24:47,498
Fuck.

1281
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:58,592
Get your Ghostface ass away from me,
Ghostface.

1282
01:25:07,101 --> 01:25:08,102
Go away.

1283
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:17,277
-Where's Mindy?
-She missed the train.

1284
01:25:17,361 --> 01:25:19,696
I was gonna wait for her,
but Cute Boy here dragged me on.

1285
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:21,615
- I was trying to keep us together.
-By pulling us apart?

1286
01:25:24,535 --> 01:25:25,536
It's okay.

1287
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,330
It's fine, she's with Ethan.

1288
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:28,580
She'll meet us there.

1289
01:25:30,082 --> 01:25:33,293
This is a South Ferry bound
local one train.

1290
01:25:33,377 --> 01:25:34,211
Oh, shit.

1291
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:37,006
The next stop is 79th Street.

1292
01:25:48,184 --> 01:25:49,643
How many stops do we have?

1293
01:25:55,149 --> 01:25:56,400
Ten.

1294
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:33,103
This is 79th Street.

1295
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:51,538
This is a South Ferry bound
local one train.

1296
01:26:52,206 --> 01:26:55,334
The next stop is 72nd Street.

1297
01:27:16,897 --> 01:27:20,734
This is a South Ferry bound
local one train.

1298
01:27:21,444 --> 01:27:24,447
The next stop is 79th Street.

1299
01:27:28,951 --> 01:27:30,452
Sorry!

1300
01:27:54,226 --> 01:27:55,310
Still nothing from Mindy.

1301
01:27:55,895 --> 01:27:58,522
This is 72nd Street.

1302
01:28:06,989 --> 01:28:07,990
Guys?

1303
01:28:20,711 --> 01:28:24,673
The next stop is 66th Street,
Lincoln Center.

1304
01:28:32,139 --> 01:28:33,140
Hey.

1305
01:28:34,225 --> 01:28:35,517
Fuck you.

1306
01:28:35,601 --> 01:28:39,187
This is a South Ferry bound
local one train.

1307
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:43,858
The next stop is 66th Street,
Lincoln Center.

1308
01:30:18,078 --> 01:30:21,456
This is 66th Street, Lincoln Center.

1309
01:30:28,005 --> 01:30:32,426
As you exit, please be careful
of the platform and the train.

1310
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:39,099
Oh, shit.

1311
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:41,602
Mindy! Fuck!

1312
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:44,271
Shit, shit. Mindy!

1313
01:30:44,355 --> 01:30:46,315
Fuck, that's a lot of blood.

1314
01:30:46,857 --> 01:30:48,441
Help! Somebody help!

1315
01:30:49,026 --> 01:30:50,777
Fuck. We got to get you out of here, okay?

1316
01:30:52,488 --> 01:30:53,489
Damn it.

1317
01:30:53,572 --> 01:30:55,490
-Come on!
-Fuck!

1318
01:30:55,574 --> 01:30:57,993
Shit. Somebody call 911!

1319
01:31:01,872 --> 01:31:03,206
-Oh, my God.
-Are you okay?

1320
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:04,499
Yeah, I'm so good.

1321
01:31:04,583 --> 01:31:06,668
You're gonna be okay.

1322
01:31:06,752 --> 01:31:09,880
Goddamn it. I got it wrong again.

1323
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,673
What the fuck?

1324
01:31:11,757 --> 01:31:12,758
Help!

1325
01:31:12,841 --> 01:31:15,760
Yeah, we need medical assistance
We're at the 66th Street station.

1326
01:31:15,844 --> 01:31:17,428
Fuck this franchise.

1327
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:27,815
Hey.

1328
01:31:28,941 --> 01:31:31,526
I talked to Bailey.
I've got everything set up.

1329
01:31:32,486 --> 01:31:35,113
-Where are Mindy and Ethan?
-They're five minutes behind us.

1330
01:31:35,948 --> 01:31:37,240
Let's get you all inside.

1331
01:31:38,784 --> 01:31:40,327
-Not you.
-What?

1332
01:31:42,746 --> 01:31:44,539
Don't trust anyone, remember?

1333
01:31:45,499 --> 01:31:46,541
We don't know you.

1334
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:49,753
Not really.

1335
01:31:50,295 --> 01:31:51,421
You know me.

1336
01:31:51,505 --> 01:31:53,215
You're not Woodsboro.

1337
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:56,802
I'm sorry.

1338
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:00,722
It's okay. It's okay, I get it.

1339
01:32:02,641 --> 01:32:03,850
Be safe, okay?

1340
01:32:05,310 --> 01:32:06,394
Okay?

1341
01:32:07,438 --> 01:32:08,439
You, too.

1342
01:32:11,567 --> 01:32:12,776
Good call.

1343
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:20,159
I cleared the whole place
before you got here.

1344
01:32:21,243 --> 01:32:23,954
So, this is the only way in or out.

1345
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:25,706
He steps in through the first door,

1346
01:32:25,789 --> 01:32:28,416
both doors lock automatically,
trapping him inside.

1347
01:32:28,917 --> 01:32:30,752
We turn it into a kill box.

1348
01:32:30,836 --> 01:32:33,713
-Weapons?
-One gun, and I hold onto it.

1349
01:32:34,631 --> 01:32:37,717
I am the only one with a badge here
and that's the way it's gonna be.

1350
01:32:39,386 --> 01:32:40,637
We're safe here.

1351
01:32:44,016 --> 01:32:47,102
I'm gonna check in with Mindy.
See if they're close.

1352
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:10,041
Come on, come on.

1353
01:33:10,125 --> 01:33:12,627
Hey, you've reached me. Leave a message.

1354
01:33:13,212 --> 01:33:14,504
You know you're not safe here.

1355
01:33:15,005 --> 01:33:17,841
Whenever someone says,
"We're safe here," it means you're not.

1356
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:20,552
-Not now.
-But you're smarter than this, Sam.

1357
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:22,846
Grab a weapon
and clear this place yourself.

1358
01:33:25,432 --> 01:33:26,683
You know I'm right.

1359
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:44,409
Excellent choice.

1360
01:33:46,787 --> 01:33:48,121
My favorite.

1361
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:52,126
Kirby?

1362
01:33:57,005 --> 01:33:58,006
Kirby!

1363
01:34:19,403 --> 01:34:20,404
Hello?

1364
01:34:20,946 --> 01:34:22,614
Get everyone out of there, Sam,
you're not safe.

1365
01:34:22,698 --> 01:34:24,574
[ Heard from the Atlanta field office.

1366
01:34:24,658 --> 01:34:26,868
They said Agent Reed's been
on a downward spiral

1367
01:34:26,952 --> 01:34:28,662
ever since the Woodsboro murders
last year.

1368
01:34:28,745 --> 01:34:29,746
What are you talking about?

1369
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:32,874
They fired Kirby two months ago
for being mentally unstable.

1370
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:35,377
-What?
-She's no longer with the FBI.

1371
01:34:49,474 --> 01:34:51,893
-Listen, asshole.
-No, you listen, you little bitch.

1372
01:34:51,977 --> 01:34:54,646
Hang up on me,
[I gut you like a fish. Understand?

1373
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:58,692
- What do you want?
- To see what your insides look like.

1374
01:35:02,905 --> 01:35:04,489
Oh, shit.

1375
01:35:12,623 --> 01:35:15,042
When was the last time
anybody used this place?

1376
01:35:15,125 --> 01:35:16,793
It's so old.

1377
01:35:22,090 --> 01:35:23,966
I'm sorry, you can have them.

1378
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:25,761
-Take them.
-No, I mean...

1379
01:35:25,844 --> 01:35:27,679
If you want them, you have them.

1380
01:35:27,763 --> 01:35:29,055
-You think I want these?
-Kind of.

1381
01:35:29,139 --> 01:35:30,640
They're a hundred years old.

1382
01:35:31,433 --> 01:35:32,684
Maybe that's your thing.

1383
01:35:39,441 --> 01:35:40,567
I actually--

1384
01:35:52,329 --> 01:35:54,914
It's maybe embarrassing how long
I've wanted to do that.

1385
01:35:55,624 --> 01:35:57,375
You should've done that a lot sooner.

1386
01:35:57,459 --> 01:35:58,460
I know.

1387
01:35:58,961 --> 01:36:01,129
But you could also do it a lot more times.

1388
01:36:04,716 --> 01:36:05,883
<i>Tara!</i>

1389
01:36:16,311 --> 01:36:18,896
Tara, let's go. Come on, come on!

1390
01:36:20,274 --> 01:36:21,483
Come on, go, go, go!

1391
01:36:22,442 --> 01:36:25,153
-It's Kirby. She's the killer.
-No shit.

1392
01:36:25,237 --> 01:36:27,530
-That's locked. Come on.
-Are we trapped?

1393
01:36:27,614 --> 01:36:30,241
She made this whole theater a kill box.
For us.

1394
01:36:30,909 --> 01:36:32,827
Hey, what about that?
There's an exit door.

1395
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:35,371
Maybe it leads to the roof or something?

1396
01:36:35,455 --> 01:36:37,290
There's only one way to find out.
Let's go.

1397
01:36:37,374 --> 01:36:38,375
Bailey's on the way, but--

1398
01:36:42,212 --> 01:36:43,463
Oh, fuck!

1399
01:36:45,382 --> 01:36:46,383
Beheadings!

1400
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:49,886
Tara! Come on.

1401
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:52,806
Smile for the camera, motherfucker!

1402
01:36:56,351 --> 01:36:57,435
This way! Come on!

1403
01:36:57,519 --> 01:36:59,687
She should be running out the front door.

1404
01:37:05,569 --> 01:37:06,611
Get fucked!

1405
01:37:24,588 --> 01:37:25,922
Tara, go! Go!

1406
01:37:32,971 --> 01:37:34,263
No!

1407
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:35,891
Chad!

1408
01:37:39,227 --> 01:37:40,561
Run.

1409
01:37:42,522 --> 01:37:43,523
Go.

1410
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:53,783
Don’t go there. You're starting to sound...

1411
01:37:53,867 --> 01:37:55,910
-This way. Up here. Come on.
-...like a Wes Carpenter flick.

1412
01:37:58,121 --> 01:38:00,331
We've got a long night ahead of us.

1413
01:38:00,415 --> 01:38:01,833
Everybody's a suspect.

1414
01:38:03,835 --> 01:38:06,546
You're not scared, are you?

1415
01:38:09,299 --> 01:38:10,717
Oh, Sam!

1416
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:14,012
It's a lot scarier when there's no motive.

1417
01:38:14,096 --> 01:38:15,514
Ready?

1418
01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:17,598
I need you to be ready. Ready?

1419
01:38:18,975 --> 01:38:19,976
Look at me.

1420
01:38:21,603 --> 01:38:22,937
I'm ready.

1421
01:38:23,021 --> 01:38:24,981
Come on, motherfucker!

1422
01:38:28,026 --> 01:38:29,027
It's okay!

1423
01:38:29,778 --> 01:38:32,530
-Stay the fuck back!
-We know it's you, Kirby.

1424
01:38:33,615 --> 01:38:35,783
One of them knocked me out.

1425
01:38:36,451 --> 01:38:39,162
Kirby, stop! Get away from the girls!

1426
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:42,290
What are you doing?

1427
01:38:42,374 --> 01:38:44,751
Did you kill Quinn?
Did you kill my daughter?

1428
01:38:44,835 --> 01:38:46,211
Jesus Christ!

1429
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:51,425
Whatever he's been saying to you,
don't listen to him.

1430
01:38:51,508 --> 01:38:53,134
He's probably the killer.

1431
01:38:54,052 --> 01:38:54,927
Behind you!

1432
01:39:05,021 --> 01:39:06,022
Great job.

1433
01:39:10,902 --> 01:39:11,903
Both of you.

1434
01:39:13,738 --> 01:39:15,448
-You?
-Yeah, of course me.

1435
01:39:16,074 --> 01:39:19,118
Frankly, I expected more from
the two of you after what you did to us.

1436
01:39:19,202 --> 01:39:20,286
What do you mean, "us"?

1437
01:39:26,501 --> 01:39:27,585
Ta-da!

1438
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:31,256
Mindy was right.
It was easy to juke the roommate lottery.

1439
01:39:31,965 --> 01:39:33,383
All I had to do to meet you

1440
01:39:33,467 --> 01:39:37,804
was room with a conceited,
condescending alpha literally named Chad.

1441
01:39:38,805 --> 01:39:40,556
Fuck, it felt good to kill him!

1442
01:39:41,933 --> 01:39:43,476
This was your grandmother's, Sam.

1443
01:39:44,603 --> 01:39:46,104
Nancy Loomis?

1444
01:39:46,188 --> 01:39:48,356
Really runs in your fucking family,
doesn't it?

1445
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:50,691
-Speaking of family...
-Wait for it.

1446
01:39:50,775 --> 01:39:52,276
...my name's not Ethan Landry...

1447
01:39:52,819 --> 01:39:53,820
is it, Dad?

1448
01:39:55,322 --> 01:39:56,614
"Dad"?

1449
01:39:57,115 --> 01:40:00,034
Wait. If it's you two, that just leaves...

1450
01:40:03,371 --> 01:40:04,580
Mindy?

1451
01:40:12,214 --> 01:40:13,757
Hey, roomies.

1452
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:16,634
You didn't see that one coming, did you?

1453
01:40:16,718 --> 01:40:19,679
-Yeah, because you died!
-Kind of didn't, though.

1454
01:40:20,305 --> 01:40:22,432
It was a good way
to get off the suspect list,

1455
01:40:22,933 --> 01:40:27,187
stab Gale Weathers, stab Mindy
on the train. That sort of thing.

1456
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:29,480
Yep, and I just made sure I was first
on the scene

1457
01:40:29,564 --> 01:40:31,566
so I could switch her body out
with a fresh one.

1458
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,527
A little fake blood, a prosthetic.

1459
01:40:34,611 --> 01:40:37,530
You'd be amazed at
what a grieving father can get away with.

1460
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:39,824
I got Stu Macher's mask.

1461
01:40:40,534 --> 01:40:41,618
He was my favorite.

1462
01:40:44,496 --> 01:40:46,247
Nice. That's number three.

1463
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:47,958
That's two.

1464
01:40:48,917 --> 01:40:49,918
Which leaves...

1465
01:40:51,336 --> 01:40:52,587
your father's.

1466
01:40:54,923 --> 01:40:57,258
This is what we've been counting down to,
Sam.

1467
01:41:00,512 --> 01:41:02,305
I'm gonna need you to put it on.

1468
01:41:04,599 --> 01:41:05,600
Fuck you!

1469
01:41:08,603 --> 01:41:10,104
Stay the fuck away from her!

1470
01:41:10,772 --> 01:41:11,898
Come on.

1471
01:41:11,982 --> 01:41:13,775
What? What is this?

1472
01:41:14,276 --> 01:41:15,610
You did this as a family?

1473
01:41:15,694 --> 01:41:18,321
Hell yeah, bitch!
You should know better than anyone.

1474
01:41:18,405 --> 01:41:19,823
They're still not getting it.

1475
01:41:19,906 --> 01:41:21,407
I don't know what you believe,

1476
01:41:21,908 --> 01:41:24,952
but I didn't commit those murders
in Woodsboro. It wasn't me!

1477
01:41:25,036 --> 01:41:26,287
We know that. Of course you didn't.

1478
01:41:26,371 --> 01:41:30,041
You think this is based on
some bullshit conspiracy theory?

1479
01:41:30,125 --> 01:41:34,504
Come on. Who do you think started
the rumors about you in the first place?

1480
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:38,341
Do you know how easy it was

1481
01:41:38,425 --> 01:41:42,387
to turn Sam from the hero of Woodsboro
into the villain?

1482
01:41:42,971 --> 01:41:45,556
How easy it is to convince the world

1483
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:49,810
to believe the worst in people
rather than the best?

1484
01:41:49,894 --> 01:41:52,897
Because it's not enough
to just kill someone these days.

1485
01:41:53,398 --> 01:41:56,275
You have
to assassinate their character first.

1486
01:41:56,359 --> 01:42:00,446
So when Dad here "discovers”
your horribly mutilated bodies...

1487
01:42:01,364 --> 01:42:03,949
posed with Sam wearing her father's mask,

1488
01:42:04,034 --> 01:42:06,161
he'll say some poor dumb bastard read
on the Internet

1489
01:42:06,244 --> 01:42:07,620
that you're the real Ghostface

1490
01:42:07,704 --> 01:42:10,415
and took matters
into their own deluded hands.

1491
01:42:10,498 --> 01:42:13,250
Exactly!
That's why it's the perfect alibi.

1492
01:42:13,335 --> 01:42:16,421
And all the best lies
are based on the truth.

1493
01:42:18,089 --> 01:42:19,090
And you're a killer.

1494
01:42:19,174 --> 01:42:20,758
-Just like your father.
-No, I'm not!

1495
01:42:20,842 --> 01:42:24,595
Yes, you are, you motherfucker!
You killed our brother!

1496
01:42:26,348 --> 01:42:27,640
What are you talking about?

1497
01:42:27,724 --> 01:42:29,267
You said your brother died
in a car accident.

1498
01:42:29,351 --> 01:42:31,311
No, no, no, you sweet, dumb thing.

1499
01:42:31,978 --> 01:42:33,354
He died in Woodsboro...

1500
01:42:34,397 --> 01:42:36,440
at the hands of your bitch sister.

1501
01:42:47,243 --> 01:42:48,369
You're Richie's family.

1502
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:53,083
Yeah.

1503
01:42:55,335 --> 01:42:56,336
Go! Go!

1504
01:42:56,419 --> 01:42:58,379
-Now she's finally starting to get it.
-Now!

1505
01:42:58,463 --> 01:43:00,047
It wasn't until I saw that photograph

1506
01:43:00,131 --> 01:43:02,842
of what you'd actually done to him
that I knew.

1507
01:43:03,468 --> 01:43:05,678
That I knew you had to fucking die!
You had to be punished!

1508
01:43:05,762 --> 01:43:08,181
Along with anyone else
who stands in our way.

1509
01:43:11,643 --> 01:43:13,144
There she is.

1510
01:43:14,771 --> 01:43:16,481
There's the fucking killer.

1511
01:43:16,564 --> 01:43:20,109
-Great parenting job, by the way.
-Shut your whore fucking mouth!

1512
01:43:21,236 --> 01:43:23,279
-Oh, shit.
-You okay?

1513
01:43:23,363 --> 01:43:25,656
Have I been a perfect dad? No.

1514
01:43:26,366 --> 01:43:30,866
Have I maybe overindulged Richie's
love of these little movies? Yeah, maybe.

1515
01:43:32,497 --> 01:43:33,831
For me, they're just a little dark.

1516
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:35,625
But...

1517
01:43:37,877 --> 01:43:39,003
Richie really loved them.

1518
01:43:40,046 --> 01:43:41,172
He loved them!

1519
01:43:42,173 --> 01:43:43,632
He even made a few of his own.

1520
01:43:45,093 --> 01:43:46,719
Did you know? Did you know?

1521
01:43:48,805 --> 01:43:51,182
So you think I didn't post
a holiday special.

1522
01:43:51,266 --> 01:43:54,560
<i>Well, I tried to. I really did try.</i>

1523
01:43:55,603 --> 01:43:57,605
That I could interact with.

1524
01:43:57,689 --> 01:44:00,441
There's a very special bond
between a father

1525
01:44:00,525 --> 01:44:02,109
and his first son.

1526
01:44:06,364 --> 01:44:08,115
Which is why
I helped him build this collection.

1527
01:44:09,743 --> 01:44:12,078
This was... all his?

1528
01:44:12,162 --> 01:44:15,456
Yes, he's a very passionate collector.
And he inspired others.

1529
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:19,252
We had to kill those two
wannabe film students because, well...

1530
01:44:20,086 --> 01:44:21,462
we had to kill you first, Sam.

1531
01:44:22,338 --> 01:44:24,131
I put the theater in their name,

1532
01:44:24,215 --> 01:44:26,550
then good ol' Detective Bailey
would've just stumbled on it

1533
01:44:26,634 --> 01:44:28,677
but I didn't have to because, by golly,

1534
01:44:28,762 --> 01:44:31,181
that Gale Weathers
is one hell of a journalist.

1535
01:44:31,931 --> 01:44:33,807
I built a tribute to my son.

1536
01:44:35,101 --> 01:44:37,728
Which is why this is
where you have to die, Sam...

1537
01:44:39,063 --> 01:44:41,732
surrounded by all the things
he loved the most.

1538
01:44:41,816 --> 01:44:45,236
What happens next? After you're done
with us you just disappear?

1539
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:47,071
No! We got to hurry over to the hospital

1540
01:44:47,155 --> 01:44:49,448
and make sure Mindy
and Gale don't pull through.

1541
01:44:49,532 --> 01:44:50,783
Because everybody dies, Sam!

1542
01:44:50,867 --> 01:44:54,704
Everyone who had anything to do
with the death of my son suffers and dies.

1543
01:44:54,788 --> 01:44:55,914
Fuck yeah, they do!

1544
01:44:55,997 --> 01:44:57,915
Now put on the mask.

1545
01:44:59,876 --> 01:45:00,877
He was...

1546
01:45:02,086 --> 01:45:03,378
so pathetic.

1547
01:45:05,632 --> 01:45:06,633
That's not true.

1548
01:45:06,716 --> 01:45:07,591
Yeah, your son...

1549
01:45:08,885 --> 01:45:12,763
he was a man-baby who
made his girlfriend do all the killing.

1550
01:45:13,598 --> 01:45:15,725
He was a strong, virile young man!

1551
01:45:16,226 --> 01:45:19,896
He was a limp-dick little fuck
who cried before I slit his throat.

1552
01:45:19,979 --> 01:45:22,856
Shut the fuck up!

1553
01:45:27,278 --> 01:45:28,279
Sam, come on!

1554
01:45:31,032 --> 01:45:32,324
Recognize this?

1555
01:45:32,408 --> 01:45:33,617
Fuck you!

1556
01:45:38,248 --> 01:45:39,832
Sorry, but I kind of need this.

1557
01:45:42,585 --> 01:45:43,877
Fuck him up.

1558
01:45:44,754 --> 01:45:46,255
What are you gonna do about it, bitch?

1559
01:45:47,215 --> 01:45:48,591
Fuck!

1560
01:45:51,344 --> 01:45:52,595
Sam!

1561
01:45:58,810 --> 01:45:59,769
I'll get help.

1562
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:16,119
Be careful.

1563
01:46:18,538 --> 01:46:19,539
Come on.

1564
01:46:26,838 --> 01:46:28,339
Go get her. Get her!

1565
01:46:28,965 --> 01:46:31,008
-I can't grab you.
-It's okay.

1566
01:46:31,092 --> 01:46:33,928
I can't grab on. I can't grab on.

1567
01:46:35,096 --> 01:46:36,097
No!

1568
01:46:37,056 --> 01:46:38,265
No!

1569
01:46:38,349 --> 01:46:40,642
I've always wanted
to stick something in you, Tara.

1570
01:46:40,727 --> 01:46:42,353
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

1571
01:46:50,194 --> 01:46:52,070
You guys are so fucked now!

1572
01:46:54,115 --> 01:46:55,324
Sam.

1573
01:46:58,161 --> 01:46:59,078
Sam?

1574
01:46:59,162 --> 01:47:00,955
-Let me go.
-No!

1575
01:47:01,539 --> 01:47:03,165
Yeah, let her go, Sam, come on.

1576
01:47:05,376 --> 01:47:06,210
Fuck!

1577
01:47:06,294 --> 01:47:07,670
-Trust me.
-Fuck!

1578
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:17,304
You have to let me go.

1579
01:47:28,441 --> 01:47:29,358
Gotcha!

1580
01:47:49,545 --> 01:47:51,171
Now die a fucking virgin.

1581
01:47:59,681 --> 01:48:01,599
Looks like you're down another brother.

1582
01:48:11,401 --> 01:48:13,111
Always got to shoot them in the head.

1583
01:48:20,201 --> 01:48:21,243
Oh, fuck.

1584
01:48:30,294 --> 01:48:31,545
Hello.

1585
01:48:45,476 --> 01:48:48,020
Do you see your boyfriend anywhere?

1586
01:48:48,104 --> 01:48:50,439
I don't even have a boyfriend right now.

1587
01:48:51,983 --> 01:48:53,567
Would you like one?

1588
01:48:53,651 --> 01:48:56,570
I don't even know you
and I dislike you already.

1589
01:49:07,290 --> 01:49:11,335
Hello, Detective Bailey.
I've got one question for you.

1590
01:49:12,086 --> 01:49:13,087
Oh, yeah?

1591
01:49:14,172 --> 01:49:15,173
What's that?

1592
01:49:16,549 --> 01:49:18,968
What's your favorite scary movie?

1593
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:23,097
"Favorite scary movie."

1594
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:26,225
I'm asking because you're in one now.

1595
01:49:27,143 --> 01:49:28,853
You're in my movie.

1596
01:49:36,819 --> 01:49:38,987
I see you've put on your true face, huh?

1597
01:49:40,364 --> 01:49:41,656
Your birthright.

1598
01:49:43,242 --> 01:49:45,035
Poetic that you're gonna die in it.

1599
01:49:45,536 --> 01:49:47,663
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

1600
01:49:51,876 --> 01:49:53,252
Now you know the truth, huh?

1601
01:49:54,003 --> 01:49:55,170
Murder's in your blood!

1602
01:49:58,091 --> 01:49:59,884
Stop fucking around and show yourself!

1603
01:50:00,593 --> 01:50:02,511
Be careful what you wish for.

1604
01:50:03,805 --> 01:50:05,848
All right, I'm a fucking police officer.

1605
01:50:05,932 --> 01:50:09,477
How do you think this is gonna go, Sam?
Who do you think they're gonna believe?

1606
01:50:11,938 --> 01:50:14,315
Probably the one who's still alive.

1607
01:50:22,615 --> 01:50:23,699
No! No!

1608
01:50:52,019 --> 01:50:54,771
My father was a murderer.

1609
01:50:57,733 --> 01:50:59,151
No matter what you think,

1610
01:51:00,027 --> 01:51:01,737
I'm better than that.

1611
01:51:04,365 --> 01:51:05,449
Thank you.

1612
01:51:07,034 --> 01:51:08,118
Thank you.

1613
01:51:14,458 --> 01:51:16,543
But you did fuck with our family, so...

1614
01:51:31,767 --> 01:51:33,769
-Nice.
-Thanks.

1615
01:51:35,563 --> 01:51:36,605
You okay?

1616
01:51:42,069 --> 01:51:43,070
No.

1617
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:22,734
Thank you for letting me go.

1618
01:52:26,614 --> 01:52:28,198
I knew you could take care of yourself.

1619
01:52:35,706 --> 01:52:37,249
I want to be in your life,

1620
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:39,668
but only as much as you want me to be.

1621
01:52:39,752 --> 01:52:41,044
I want you to be.

1622
01:52:41,712 --> 01:52:44,423
I promise you I'm gonna get
so much therapy after this.

1623
01:52:45,007 --> 01:52:46,049
I'm serious.

1624
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:53,766
We're gonna get through this.

1625
01:52:55,309 --> 01:52:56,310
Together.

1626
01:53:14,412 --> 01:53:16,831
I saw that in a scary movie once.

1627
01:53:21,877 --> 01:53:23,295
Sam. Hey.

1628
01:53:23,379 --> 01:53:25,089
Two over there. Let's go.

1629
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:35,932
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1630
01:53:37,435 --> 01:53:39,687
I thought you might need
some reinforcements.

1631
01:53:39,770 --> 01:53:43,023
And I called Mount Sinai,
and Mindy and Gale are gonna be okay.

1632
01:53:43,774 --> 01:53:45,984
Mindy's on her way here now.
They couldn't stop her.

1633
01:53:46,068 --> 01:53:47,152
Not bad, Cute Boy.

1634
01:53:48,154 --> 01:53:49,155
Thanks.

1635
01:54:00,708 --> 01:54:03,168
If you ever need me, call.

1636
01:54:03,669 --> 01:54:06,213
We're all part
of the same fucked-up family now.

1637
01:54:06,797 --> 01:54:10,133
And legacy doesn't always have
to be a bad thing.

1638
01:54:11,177 --> 01:54:12,178
Okay.

1639
01:54:15,806 --> 01:54:16,807
Hey.

1640
01:54:19,727 --> 01:54:20,811
It's just Chad.

1641
01:54:24,774 --> 01:54:26,192
Hey, we got another one here!

1642
01:54:27,568 --> 01:54:29,069
Watch out, coming through.

1643
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:33,865
-Oh, my God.
-Chad! Chad!

1644
01:54:33,949 --> 01:54:35,241
How are you alive?

1645
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:40,956
Core Fucking Four.

1646
01:54:46,212 --> 01:54:48,005
Sorry. You probably need that.

1647
01:54:48,089 --> 01:54:49,882
Oh, my God! Are you guys okay?

1648
01:54:49,965 --> 01:54:52,008
I know who the killer is!
It's Ethan and Bailey.

1649
01:54:52,843 --> 01:54:55,846
-And Quinn.
-And Quinn? Fuck!

1650
01:54:55,930 --> 01:54:57,264
Did I miss the monologue again?

1651
01:54:57,848 --> 01:54:59,349
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1652
01:54:59,975 --> 01:55:01,226
You don't look okay.

1653
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:04,146
Oh, my God, we all survived.
It's a twist on a twist.

1654
01:55:04,230 --> 01:55:08,025
They gave me a lot of drugs.
You guys should get some of these drugs.

1655
01:55:08,109 --> 01:55:09,902
I can't feel anything below my shoulders.

1656
01:55:32,341 --> 01:55:33,342
Sam.

1657
01:55:34,176 --> 01:55:35,260
Coming?

1658
02:02:17,329 --> 02:02:20,081
Not every movie needs a post-credit scene.
