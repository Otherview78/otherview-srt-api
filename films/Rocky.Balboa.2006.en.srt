1
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,374
Another quick knockout for Mason Dixon,
almost perfunctory.

2
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,457
The fans let him know how they feel.

3
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:56,713
Hide the women and children.
This could get ugly.

4
00:01:56,817 --> 00:02:01,343
This crowd does nothing to hide
its anger over this latest debacle.

5
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:04,180
The fans are mad.
They don't want to take it any more.

6
00:02:04,284 --> 00:02:06,722
They seem to be blaming Dixon,
a good fighter,

7
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:11,642
for the decline not only of the heavyweight
division guys, but of the entire sport.

8
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:17,151
They're actually pelting the undefeated
heavyweight champion with ice.

9
00:02:17,256 --> 00:02:20,487
Maybe this angry reaction
will pressure Dixon

10
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:24,196
to fight someone who can fight back -
if there's somebody out there.

11
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,298
All of boxing is hoping for a warrior
who thrills us with his passion.

12
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,726
Time goes by too fast.

13
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:04,398
Yeah? Not fast enough.
Your kid should've been here.

14
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:06,611
- That's all right.
- No, it ain't.

15
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:10,864
- The kid gets a little busy sometimes.
- He don't get that busy.

16
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:15,413
Well, let's not talk about it here, OK?
You're coming tonight, right?

17
00:05:15,517 --> 00:05:19,248
I'm working.
I took the tour the last three years.

18
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:23,335
- I know, but it's the anniversary.
- Fine. You got my word.

19
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,713
I appreciate it. Thank you.

20
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:27,968
I owe you, Paulie.

21
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:04,293
Robert, what's going on?
Where've you been? You're late.

22
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,172
I don't want to hear it.

23
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:10,257
Your job performance is nowhere near
good enough to be pulling this.

24
00:06:10,362 --> 00:06:13,551
I don't give a damn who your father is.
You understand me?

25
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:15,969
All right. Now get outta here.

26
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:18,061
Thank you, sir.

27
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:22,018
Yo, Robert.

28
00:06:22,122 --> 00:06:24,396
Yo.

29
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:27,607
- Hey, how you doin'?
- What's up, champ?

30
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:31,567
- You caught me off guard.
- I wanted to catch you before you got busy.

31
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:34,492
- Yeah, it gets busy up there.
- So how you doin'?

32
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:36,157
- Real good.
- Yeah?

33
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:39,618
- Yo, Rock!
- Yeah, how you doin'?

34
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:44,123
- Yeah, real good.
- You wanna go out and get some coffee?

35
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:48,167
- I'm kinda behind. Maybe later?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

36
00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:52,174
Come by the restaurant tonight.
I can have something made special for you.

37
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:56,722
Tonight I can't. I got plans.
A few of the guys get together, you know?

38
00:06:56,827 --> 00:06:59,476
- Did I do something wrong?
- What do you mean?

39
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:02,600
Well... I don't know exactly what I mean,

40
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:06,771
but I just think that when I come here
you don't feel so comfortable

41
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:10,193
and I certainly don't wanna do that.

42
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:13,530
- You... you throw a big shadow.
- A big shadow?

43
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:16,240
You won't get anything done
down here, Robert.

44
00:07:16,344 --> 00:07:19,783
If you won't introduce me, then I will.
I'm William Tomilson.

45
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:22,496
- How you doin'?
- Your son works for me.

46
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,414
It's a good job.

47
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:27,542
I've told Robert about 20 times
that I wanted to meet you.

48
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:32,673
I guess you're pretty busy, which isn't a bad
thing, is it? Grab a shot, will you, please?

49
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:36,216
I may not get this chance again.
Old warhorses gotta stick together.

50
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,513
- The old horses, yeah.
- I tell you.

51
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:42,471
- It's a good thing it's not your left.
- This makes you very popular.

52
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:45,812
- One, two, three.
- Finally we get to meet.

53
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,477
I gotta go.
It was nice to meet you face to face.

54
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:53,323
- How you doin'?
- You take care of yourself. I'll see you later.

55
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:58,196
I gotta get going.
I'll change my plans for tonight.

56
00:07:58,301 --> 00:08:01,120
That'd be great.
I'm lookin' forward to it.

57
00:08:01,224 --> 00:08:03,124
- OK.
- OK.

58
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:07,375
And do not let those numbers
drive you crazy.

59
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,968
- Too late.
- Use an eraser and get rid of all of 'em.

60
00:08:14,604 --> 00:08:16,424
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Rock.

61
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:18,515
How you doin'?

62
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:35,198
Here you go.

63
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,038
It'll be about ten tenths, OK?
You guys take care, OK? You got it.

64
00:08:46,218 --> 00:08:48,377
I'll try a few of these later on.

65
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,794
- It's good for bakin'.
- How much?

66
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,839
- Paul, what's the cost?
- 58.40, sir.

67
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:56,472
Right. Take it out of that. I trust you.

68
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,313
- You're generous.
- Not a problem.

69
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,576
How you guys doin'?

70
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:29,413
How we doin', Isabel?

71
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:32,042
OK, except for the freebie readin' the Bible.

72
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:33,294
He's OK.

73
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:35,960
Just cos you fought him
don't mean you gotta feed him.

74
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:39,468
- He doesn't even look like a fighter.
- Spider Rico could hit.

75
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:42,305
- Listen, how's your stomach?
- It's OK.

76
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:46,851
If you keep rubbing that olive oil on your
stomach, your kid will be born very strong.

77
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:50,529
- OK, whatever you say.
- No, really.

78
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:55,443
- Yo, how you doin', Spider?
- God bless you, Rocky.

79
00:09:55,547 --> 00:09:56,783
Thanks.

80
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:04,755
- How you guys doin'?
- Hi, Rocky.

81
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:09,869
Jose, can you make something special
for my kid who's comin' tonight?

82
00:10:09,973 --> 00:10:12,500
- <i>No problemo.</i>
- Good.

83
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:14,589
I appreciate it.

84
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:19,300
Back and forth, back and forth.
Give and take.

85
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:22,636
Then I went in there like an animal
and threw him into the corner

86
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,510
and I unloaded everything I had -
hook, hook, hook, left, left, left.

87
00:10:26,615 --> 00:10:31,433
But Creed, he kept busting me back
pretty good and the agony began to pile up.

88
00:10:31,537 --> 00:10:34,940
Then I heard the best sound
I ever heard in my life...

89
00:10:35,044 --> 00:10:36,818
- The bell.
- Right, the bell.

90
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:40,026
And I ain't ever been so tired
and I'm sittin' in my corner

91
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,825
and I'm trying to figure out how to survive
the last round when Mickey says:

92
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:48,117
"Come on. Get out there
and fight this guy hard, you bum."

93
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:50,579
"You gotta be first. You gotta be first."

94
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:54,206
- I said, "Yo, Mick, if I could..."
- "I would."

95
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,168
"I would." The end.

96
00:10:57,272 --> 00:10:59,259
- <i>Salud.</i>
- <i>Salud.</i>

97
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:27,364
Another quick knockout for Mason Dixon,
almost perfunctory.

98
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:30,204
The fans let him know how they feel.

99
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:36,468
They're actually pelting the undefeated
heavyweight champion with ice.

100
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,633
Hello, Adrian's.

101
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:45,511
Yeah?

102
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:47,804
Tell him you can't make it?

103
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,514
Yeah, I'll give him the message.

104
00:11:50,618 --> 00:11:55,517
I just kept hearing, you know, Mickey's
voice in my head over and over again.

105
00:11:55,621 --> 00:12:01,027
I just dug down and before you know it,
it was toe-to-toe and it was... Excuse me.

106
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:06,496
Your son said he can't make it.
He said he'll take a rain check. OK?

107
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:23,007
Look at these birds.
Don't these birds look like flying candy?

108
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:25,005
Hey, birdie, you wanna fly me home?

109
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:28,022
You need somebody to walk you home?

110
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:35,353
It's a cold night. We need a few laughs
in our life. What do you think?

111
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:37,479
Maybe? Maybe?

112
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,947
OK, let's get outta here. OK?

113
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:57,581
This place ain't changed much from last year.

114
00:12:57,686 --> 00:12:59,709
We done?

115
00:12:59,814 --> 00:13:01,928
Hey, how you doin', Mick?

116
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:10,263
- That sign's fallin' apart, Paulie.
- The whole world's fallin' apart. Look at us.

117
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:12,927
Don't talk crazy, Paulie.

118
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:18,937
You know, I think if you live someplace
long enough, you are that place.

119
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,564
I ain't no talkin' building.

120
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,230
Come on, it's gettin' late.

121
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:27,082
I get a headache from this train.

122
00:13:46,852 --> 00:13:49,883
I remember when she was standin' there

123
00:13:49,987 --> 00:13:54,182
all nervous and shy with this little smile,

124
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:57,527
and all I wanted her to do was trust me.

125
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,859
She did.

126
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:06,277
- She did.
- You done?

127
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:24,792
- How long we stayin' here?
- Not long.

128
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:28,631
- I'm glad they tore this rink down.
- Come on.

129
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:32,179
You heard me.
I'm happy they tore it apart.

130
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:40,603
The first time I walked your sister
across this ice, we was over there.

131
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:44,272
She was nervous, but I weren't
so great on the blades either.

132
00:14:44,377 --> 00:14:48,532
Ice is stupid.
People standing on ice are more stupid.

133
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:53,159
Then over there, when she was fallin'...

134
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:57,702
my hand grabbed her and I got her arm.

135
00:14:57,807 --> 00:15:00,586
Through that coat I could feel it.

136
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,580
Electric.

137
00:15:03,684 --> 00:15:07,209
You said the same thing last year, Rock.

138
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:09,877
- Did I?
- You better develop your brain.

139
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:13,091
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely.

140
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:15,976
Come on, Rock, let's go.

141
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:21,811
We're done. There's no place
to sit down around here.

142
00:15:21,915 --> 00:15:24,353
- It's all right.
- It ain't all right.

143
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:27,949
It's depressing and freakin' cold!

144
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:32,608
- What's the matter with you, Paulie?
- You're livin' backwards, Rocko.

145
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:36,154
Change the channel from yesterday.
Yesterday wasn't so great.

146
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:38,827
- It was to me.
- Not to me!

147
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:44,620
You treated her good.
You had the good times.

148
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:48,255
I treated her bad.
I don't have to think about this.

149
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,842
She always loved you, Paulie.

150
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:59,392
Sorry, Rocko.
I can't do this no more.

151
00:17:12,391 --> 00:17:14,378
- Can I help you?
- Nah, nah.

152
00:17:14,482 --> 00:17:20,009
I used to come down this place a long time
ago. Just lookin' around. No big deal.

153
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:22,433
Can I get you a drink?

154
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:26,777
- All right, maybe just a short beer.
- OK.

155
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:42,286
Go. Yeah, go on. Get him to buy you one.
Get him to buy you one. Go.

156
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,616
He's got it.
He's spending money.

157
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,834
Listen... I don't mean
to cross the line or anything,

158
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:54,002
but I read about your wife's passin'
a few years back.

159
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,630
- Yeah, it was woman cancer.
- Yeah.

160
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,047
I always heard she was a nice person.

161
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:01,139
Yeah, the best.

162
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:05,430
- Do I know you?
- We met a long time ago.

163
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:09,268
- We did?
- When I was a kid you walked me home.

164
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:12,698
- I did?
- Told me to stop smokin' and things.

165
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:16,986
Stop smokin'?

166
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,655
Are you little Marie that used to hang out
at that Atomic Hoagie shop?

167
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,199
Yeah, that's right.

168
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,616
Yeah, now I remember.
I walked you home.

169
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,577
When you got there, you turned around
and said, "Screw you, creepo."

170
00:18:29,681 --> 00:18:32,079
- I didn't say that.
- Yeah, you did.

171
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:35,709
- You sure?
- Great insults last a long time.

172
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:37,256
Yo!

173
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:40,465
- Yo, is that you? Is that really you?
- How you doin'?

174
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:44,137
- I think he wants to drink alone.
- Well, then, give him his drink.

175
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:50,817
I ain't stoppin' you. What's that, your man
or something? No, I don't think so.

176
00:18:51,949 --> 00:18:56,733
Anyway, me and my friends, we're down
there. You think you could buy us a round?

177
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:58,815
You got the money.
Just one round.

178
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,622
Hey...

179
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:04,950
What? What are you doin'
pushin' my hand away like that?

180
00:19:05,054 --> 00:19:07,825
- What's your name?
- Angie. Why do you wanna know?

181
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,453
- Angie, don't be playin' a fool for that guy.
- A fool?

182
00:19:11,557 --> 00:19:15,127
A fool? I'm the fool?
You're the fool, not me.

183
00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:18,502
You got it twisted. You're the fool.
I'm a person just like you.

184
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:22,175
You ain't no better than me.
You think you're a big shot now?

185
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,474
You ain't no better than me.
No better.

186
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:29,053
- Wow.
- Glad you dropped in?

187
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:32,766
I think the neighbourhood's changin' a little.

188
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,606
- What was that all about?
- I don't know. It's OK.

189
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:38,942
Well, if you wanna take off,
I'll tally everything up.

190
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:40,859
- Thanks.
- How you doin', Rock?

191
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:43,494
I'm good, thanks.

192
00:19:45,002 --> 00:19:48,948
- You live around here?
- About eight blocks from here.

193
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:51,041
Eight blocks.

194
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:54,291
Would you need a lift?

195
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:55,438
All right.

196
00:19:56,514 --> 00:19:59,627
- Did you ever get married?
- Yeah, sorta.

197
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,546
- Sorta?
- Well, he took off.

198
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,467
- Poof, just like that?
- Yeah, just like that.

199
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:08,556
- You sorta have any kids?
- Yeah, I got one kid.

200
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,182
Yeah, me too. Me too.

201
00:20:11,286 --> 00:20:13,893
- Wonderful boy.
- Hey, tough guy!

202
00:20:13,997 --> 00:20:16,687
What's the matter?
You can't buy a round?

203
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,231
Girl was bein' nice to your dumb ass.

204
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:21,731
Yeah, what you doin' with that pig?

205
00:20:21,835 --> 00:20:25,028
- She ain't nothin' but a jealous bitch.
- Come on back!

206
00:20:25,132 --> 00:20:26,908
Hey, don't listen to 'em.

207
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:30,160
Both of yous.
You ain't no better than me!

208
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:33,580
- Come over here!
- Everybody's her man.

209
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:37,916
- You punch-drunk, goofy bastard.
- You ain't no big shot! Look at you!

210
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,679
You ain't even got a car
to take that pig home.

211
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,550
You all right?

212
00:20:47,654 --> 00:20:49,641
Yeah.

213
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,190
What are you doing?
Don't get out. It's all right.

214
00:20:56,782 --> 00:20:59,867
No, little Marie, it ain't all right.

215
00:21:04,749 --> 00:21:06,531
- Yo!
- What?

216
00:21:06,635 --> 00:21:10,321
I'll tell you what.
Get inside. You get inside.

217
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:13,201
Hey! Leave him alone!

218
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,663
- You see that? You see that?
- Yeah, yeah.

219
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:18,040
- What do you say?
- I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

220
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,046
Good job.

221
00:21:36,072 --> 00:21:38,851
That guy sends his apologies.

222
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:40,325
OK.

223
00:21:57,134 --> 00:21:58,705
Martin.

224
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:01,554
Martin. Yo, Martin!

225
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:10,886
- I see you still got your key.
- Yeah, I got a key. You got time to talk?

226
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,761
I got a lot of time since your people let me go.

227
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:16,223
You know I had nothing to do with that.

228
00:22:16,328 --> 00:22:17,980
Yeah?

229
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:22,440
- Yeah, we moved in about a year ago.
- Yeah?

230
00:22:22,544 --> 00:22:25,398
- I mean, it's only temporary.
- Yeah, I can see that.

231
00:22:25,502 --> 00:22:28,987
- I'm gonna look for an apartment.
- Apartments are nice.

232
00:22:29,091 --> 00:22:32,990
- Yeah. It is what it is, you know.
- Yeah. It is what it is.

233
00:22:33,094 --> 00:22:36,661
But this place used to be nice.
There's a lot of history around here.

234
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:39,871
Yeah, like down the street there
is the Cambria Fight Club.

235
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:43,582
They used to call that the Bucket of Blood.
I took some beatings there.

236
00:22:43,686 --> 00:22:50,551
But it was nice. Good memories. I heard
these buildings are 100, 150 years old.

237
00:22:50,656 --> 00:22:55,763
So, I mean, if I was 150 years old I'd be
falling apart too, so it's OK building...

238
00:22:55,867 --> 00:23:00,605
- Does that light work?
- No, it's burnt out or something. Yeah.

239
00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:05,938
Hey, listen. Thanks for the ride,
and I'm sorry about those guys.

240
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:10,321
Oh, that's OK. Some of those guys just
got their brains on backwards and stuff.

241
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:13,324
- What's he doin' out so late?
- Is that your kid?

242
00:23:13,428 --> 00:23:16,116
Yeah. I wish he wouldn't stay out so late.

243
00:23:16,221 --> 00:23:18,744
- Amazing.
- Yeah? What's that?

244
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:24,041
Oh, last time I seen you, you was a kid,
and now you officially got one of your own.

245
00:23:24,145 --> 00:23:26,879
It's amazing.
You know, he sorta resembles you.

246
00:23:26,984 --> 00:23:30,420
He's got that, you know, big Irish hair.

247
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:32,761
Yeah, it's the other one.

248
00:23:35,232 --> 00:23:37,552
- Yeah?
- His father was from Jamaica.

249
00:23:37,657 --> 00:23:40,107
Jamaica? European.

250
00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:45,772
- Was you on a cruise ship or somethin'?
- No, not really.

251
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:49,525
- What's his name?
- Steps. Short for Stevenson.

252
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:52,374
Right. Makes sense.

253
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,367
Is he lookin' like he's mad at me,
or is it the angle I'm standin' at?

254
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:01,910
No, no, no. He's a good kid.
You want to meet him?

255
00:24:02,014 --> 00:24:06,043
You know, it's gettin' kinda late.
I got so many things to do. It's...

256
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:12,224
Yeah, I understand. Thanks again
for the ride and everything else.

257
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:16,635
I'll see you.

258
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,303
You too.

259
00:24:18,407 --> 00:24:22,346
Hey, Steps, come on, let's go.
Say good night to your friend.

260
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:25,976
What are you doin' out with no hat on?
Did you get something to eat?

261
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,483
- Did you eat your dinner?
- Yeah, I already ate.

262
00:24:29,587 --> 00:24:32,525
You're late, you know?
I've told you...

263
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:34,746
Yo, little Marie.

264
00:24:35,668 --> 00:24:39,575
Ain't you going to introduce me to your kid?
How you doin', Steps?

265
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,747
- What's up?
- Listen, I got this place, this restaurant,

266
00:24:42,851 --> 00:24:45,456
nice little eatery not too far from here.

267
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,751
What's all this junk? A tissue...

268
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:51,542
Sometimes I feel like a kangaroo
with all the stuff in my pocket.

269
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:53,795
Here you go.
I got a card, there it is.

270
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:59,011
And if you ever get a chance, it'd be great
if both of yous come down there and eat.

271
00:24:59,115 --> 00:25:01,178
It'd be great.
Free. You know?

272
00:25:01,282 --> 00:25:04,776
Anyway, I'll leave it over there... Here.

273
00:25:06,198 --> 00:25:09,402
I'll leave it on the steps. Steps.

274
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:15,780
See you later.

275
00:25:17,126 --> 00:25:19,284
Come on, let's go.

276
00:25:21,672 --> 00:25:26,956
You've known what's best for you
since you were ten and walked in here alone.

277
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,538
Got everything money can buy...

278
00:25:29,643 --> 00:25:32,253
except what it can't.

279
00:25:32,357 --> 00:25:34,336
It's pride.

280
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,843
Pride is what got your ass outta here.

281
00:25:37,947 --> 00:25:41,135
Losin' it is what brung you back.

282
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,139
But people like you, they need to be tested.
Need a challenge.

283
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:49,102
That ain't gonna happen.
Ain't nothin' out there.

284
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:52,320
There's always somebody out there.
Always.

285
00:25:52,912 --> 00:25:56,275
And when you find somethin'
standin' in front of you,

286
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:58,988
somethin' that ain't runnin', ain't backin' up,

287
00:25:59,092 --> 00:26:03,575
and it's hittin' on you
and you're too damn tired to breathe...

288
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,664
You find that situation on you, that's good,

289
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:09,297
cos that's baptism under fire.

290
00:26:11,222 --> 00:26:16,006
You get through that, you find
the only kind of respect that matters -

291
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,094
self-respect.

292
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:23,678
Thanks, Martin. I appreciate it.

293
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,806
Now, what can the champ do for you?

294
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:30,938
You can give me some of that money you got.

295
00:26:31,043 --> 00:26:35,031
- You know I like you, Martin.
- But not that much.

296
00:26:40,376 --> 00:26:44,077
- How about a picture with the kid, Rock?
- Sure.

297
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:51,287
Here, son, hold up your fist.
Makes you look more hazardous.

298
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:52,708
- There you go.
- Thanks.

299
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:55,374
Enjoy your meal.

300
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:57,256
- He's a nice guy.
- Rocky?

301
00:26:57,361 --> 00:27:01,130
- Yeah?
- Listen. Spider just went downstairs.

302
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:06,437
- What's he doin' down there?
- I don't know. That's your friend.

303
00:27:10,781 --> 00:27:12,146
Yo, Spider.

304
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:15,854
- Let me do some dishes. I feel better.
- Oh, come on. You're my guest.

305
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:18,522
- Let me do something.
- Keep eating. Guests do.

306
00:27:18,627 --> 00:27:21,569
Don't make me fight you again.
Last time you got lucky.

307
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,654
Lucky? OK.

308
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:26,155
Jesus wants me to work.

309
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:28,575
- Yo, Rocky.
- Yeah?

310
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,296
You got guests.

311
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:35,421
Don't get too wet, OK?

312
00:27:35,525 --> 00:27:37,472
Glad Jesus didn't ask you to cook.

313
00:27:43,856 --> 00:27:47,469
- You kept the card.
- Yeah, I kept the card.

314
00:27:47,573 --> 00:27:49,893
- Why don't you sit down?
- Yeah, sure.

315
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,613
Because you know what? I walk in there,
I say good morning, I do this, I do this.

316
00:28:04,718 --> 00:28:08,950
Tonight, boxing once again.
Two contrasting styles in almost every way.

317
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:12,411
- Hey, can you turn this up?
- Welcome to ESPN's <i>Then Versus Now.</i>

318
00:28:12,515 --> 00:28:14,663
Who was the best of all time?

319
00:28:14,767 --> 00:28:19,463
If two athletes from different eras could
compete, who would come out on top?

320
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:23,299
Given the same rules, using the same
equipment, who was the greatest?

321
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:25,299
We feed our facts into the computer.

322
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,928
They will weigh in on
who they think is supreme,

323
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:31,275
while fielding the comments
of our panel of sports writers.

324
00:28:37,243 --> 00:28:40,023
Champ!

325
00:28:40,127 --> 00:28:41,774
- Yo, champ!
- Yeah?

326
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:44,781
Man, come check out this trash
they talkin' about you.

327
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:47,867
- What you talkin' about?
- Come check this out. Hurry up.

328
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:52,868
Tonight, the former two-time heavyweight
champion from Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa.

329
00:28:52,972 --> 00:28:54,870
Chuck Johnson, <i>USA Today.</i>

330
00:28:54,974 --> 00:28:59,541
Rocky Balboa fought much tougher fights
during a much tougher era in boxing.

331
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:04,008
You look at Mason Dixon and his career,
he's been spoon-fed his opponents.

332
00:29:04,112 --> 00:29:09,559
No question in my mind, not only
does Rocky win, but he wins knockout.

333
00:29:10,026 --> 00:29:12,018
Rocky!

334
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:14,071
Offspring!

335
00:29:15,197 --> 00:29:18,228
- What do you think?
- Dixon is a victim of his own dominance.

336
00:29:18,332 --> 00:29:21,439
He's never been in real knock-down,
drag-out brawls.

337
00:29:21,543 --> 00:29:26,027
He's never had to dig down to rally back.
If he tries to dig down against Balboa,

338
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:31,325
he's gonna find that he doesn't have a big
enough shovel. I clearly give it to Balboa.

339
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:35,745
What happened to you?
What happened to you?

340
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:37,330
Burt Randolph Sugar.

341
00:29:37,434 --> 00:29:40,752
Dixon has fought cream puffs,
so we don't know what he's made of.

342
00:29:40,856 --> 00:29:46,259
Both in their primes - and you gotta factor
in Dixon's speed, his slashing offence -

343
00:29:46,363 --> 00:29:49,133
he cuts Balboa to bits, no doubt.

344
00:29:49,238 --> 00:29:52,178
Dixon wins all the way.

345
00:29:52,282 --> 00:29:56,728
Here's where our subjectivity ends.
Let's see what the computer has to say.

346
00:29:56,832 --> 00:29:59,980
Dixon unloads on Balboa.
Rocky has no answer.

347
00:30:00,084 --> 00:30:02,531
Balboa's eating dirt.

348
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:22,375
Now Dixon is done. He is reeling.
He is almost out on his feet.

349
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:25,587
Balboa turning up the heat,
hounds him across the ring.

350
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:29,047
He's bitten off more than he can chew
this time, believe it.

351
00:30:29,152 --> 00:30:31,094
Oh, a murderous right hook!

352
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:33,221
And Dixon is out on his feet!

353
00:30:33,326 --> 00:30:36,180
He is out cold
as he crumbles to the canvas.

354
00:30:36,285 --> 00:30:39,233
And it is Balboa who has won the event!

355
00:30:41,492 --> 00:30:45,442
Ladies and gentlemen,
Baby Rocky. Baby Rocky.

356
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:56,534
I'm glad you liked the food. If you heat that up
it's pretty good in the morning.

357
00:30:56,638 --> 00:30:59,662
- Yeah, thanks, man.
- Nice kid.

358
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:02,291
I hope this music ain't givin' you a headache.

359
00:31:02,395 --> 00:31:04,713
No, I like it. It's nice.

360
00:31:05,182 --> 00:31:07,175
Well, good. Good.

361
00:31:16,527 --> 00:31:19,307
Yo. You think Steps wants a job?

362
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:22,518
Make a few bucks in a weekend.
It's good makin' your own G.

363
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:25,102
My kid stashed a few bucks doin' that.

364
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:28,027
Why are you being so nice?

365
00:31:28,131 --> 00:31:33,616
I don't want you to think nothing's off,
you know? My wife, she's gone, but she ain't.

366
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,700
- Yeah, I wasn't thinkin' that, believe me.
- No? Then what was you thinkin'?

367
00:31:38,805 --> 00:31:41,413
That you don't owe us nothin'.
What are you doin'?

368
00:31:41,518 --> 00:31:43,413
Be patient.

369
00:31:43,518 --> 00:31:47,419
No, I don't owe you nothin',

370
00:31:47,524 --> 00:31:52,050
but why you gotta owe something to get...

371
00:31:52,154 --> 00:31:54,010
Yo! Yikes.

372
00:31:54,115 --> 00:31:56,395
Bingo.

373
00:32:00,863 --> 00:32:03,977
But why you gotta owe something
to get something, you know?

374
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:06,114
Really.

375
00:32:07,912 --> 00:32:11,774
I think hangin' out with your kid
would be nice. What do you think?

376
00:32:11,878 --> 00:32:14,080
I think that'd be nice.

377
00:32:15,127 --> 00:32:16,909
Good.

378
00:32:17,014 --> 00:32:20,420
That's very nice.
I'm glad you come by.

379
00:32:21,342 --> 00:32:24,212
Nice... nice watchin' you eat.

380
00:32:26,555 --> 00:32:28,548
Good company.

381
00:32:31,352 --> 00:32:34,021
Yo, little Marie.
Let there be light.

382
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:47,144
- You like dogs?
- Dogs?

383
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:49,984
Dogs. This is, like, a dog pound.

384
00:32:50,088 --> 00:32:52,316
It's where they keep...

385
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,651
a large variety of dogs.

386
00:32:54,756 --> 00:33:00,827
I used to come here for sightseein',
but, you know, you learn a lot talkin' to dogs.

387
00:33:00,931 --> 00:33:04,414
- Really, you do.
- Yeah, man.

388
00:33:04,518 --> 00:33:07,131
Hey, man, how about this one?

389
00:33:08,597 --> 00:33:13,337
- He don't look too friendly, my friend.
- This is the one. Hey, boy, how you doin'?

390
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:17,343
- What about this one? Come here, boy.
- Who, him?

391
00:33:17,447 --> 00:33:20,637
- Yeah, why not?
- Hell, no. That is one ugly dog, man.

392
00:33:20,741 --> 00:33:22,804
I know, but it's kind of a cute ugly.

393
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:26,682
If you look at it closely,
the colour kinda looks like old furniture,

394
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:29,396
like some kinda pirate chest thing goin' on.

395
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:31,857
Yeah, sure, man.
Hey, how about a young one?

396
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:35,529
Forget him. Come over here a minute.
I want you to see something.

397
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:39,992
Now, you notice what this animal
is doin' here, lyin' in that position?

398
00:33:40,097 --> 00:33:44,455
- He ain't doin' nothin'.
- He's doin' a lot. He ain't wastin' no energy.

399
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,958
Cos he's dead.

400
00:33:52,224 --> 00:33:54,966
There's a lot of good mileage
left in that animal.

401
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:59,133
Some good food, the addition of a couple
of new friends - bingo, he's back.

402
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:02,594
- But what do you think's a good name?
- It's your dog. You name him.

403
00:34:02,698 --> 00:34:05,391
Hey, no. It's a community animal.
50-50.

404
00:34:05,495 --> 00:34:08,185
Look, I don't know much about no dogs.

405
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:12,355
Well, you know, Steps, it ain't that
complicated. You pet 'em, you feed 'em,

406
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:16,904
and nature takes its course, you know.
Don't you wanna name an animal?

407
00:34:17,009 --> 00:34:21,367
I think every guy should one time
try to name an animal something.

408
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:23,410
I don't know. Fleabag.

409
00:34:23,514 --> 00:34:27,790
It's catchy. You know,
it ain't original but it's pretty good.

410
00:34:27,895 --> 00:34:33,472
I think you could come up with in your
young brain something better than Fleabag.

411
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:36,140
Punchy. How's that?

412
00:34:37,561 --> 00:34:40,052
- Punchy?
- Yeah, Punchy.

413
00:34:43,693 --> 00:34:45,762
- I like it, you know?
- For real?

414
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:49,058
For real. Punchy it is.
I think Punchy's easy to remember,

415
00:34:49,163 --> 00:34:53,396
it's not that hard to spell, and then once
it's in your brain you never forget it.

416
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,731
- Punchy. Very good.
- All right, man.

417
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:58,654
Good call. All right, Punchy.

418
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:00,903
You ready to be bailed out, my friend?

419
00:35:01,007 --> 00:35:04,032
OK. Hey.

420
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:10,133
- You know I was just joking with you, right?
- Yeah, I know. You're a very funny guy.

421
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:45,501
Rocky?

422
00:35:48,591 --> 00:35:50,583
Excuse me.

423
00:35:55,556 --> 00:35:57,255
- Rock.
- Yo, Paulie.

424
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,841
Hey, they're gonna be talking
about that fake Looney Tune fight.

425
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:03,716
Hey, come on.
We're about to serve today's special.

426
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:07,344
Italian food cooked by a bunch of Mexicans
ain't so special, Rocko.

427
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:09,851
Hey, yo.

428
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,449
Hey, I skipped work for this.

429
00:36:16,077 --> 00:36:18,484
What an ugly dog.

430
00:36:19,997 --> 00:36:23,164
It's a cute dog.

431
00:36:23,876 --> 00:36:26,407
Hey, Rock.
I'm gonna take off, all right?

432
00:36:26,511 --> 00:36:28,951
- That stuff back there is cool.
- You like that?

433
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:31,163
- Yeah, man.
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

434
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:34,627
- I'm gonna catch you later.
- All right.

435
00:36:39,016 --> 00:36:41,169
- Who's the criminal?
- He's a nice kid.

436
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:43,095
He dresses like a bum.

437
00:36:43,646 --> 00:36:47,386
Coming from a human hamper,
that's quite a compliment.

438
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,567
- Hide the silverware.
- That's nice.

439
00:36:52,822 --> 00:36:54,861
Hey, Spider.

440
00:36:58,536 --> 00:37:00,900
Didn't you knock out that bum once?

441
00:37:01,004 --> 00:37:03,203
Will you give it a rest?

442
00:37:13,301 --> 00:37:16,708
I'm gonna be late for work for this.
Give me a break, huh?

443
00:37:16,812 --> 00:37:19,796
All right, just for a few seconds.

444
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,465
In the late '60s a simulated fight
took place between two legends,

445
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:25,797
Muhammad Ali and Rocky Marciano.

446
00:37:25,902 --> 00:37:27,634
Marciano, long retired,

447
00:37:27,738 --> 00:37:30,678
and Ali, unable to fight legitimately
for three years

448
00:37:30,783 --> 00:37:33,262
for refusing induction
into the armed forces,

449
00:37:33,366 --> 00:37:36,270
was in need of money
and agreed to the dream match

450
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:39,063
whose outcome would be decided
by a computer.

451
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:43,860
It's almost 35 years since Rocky Marciano
won the much-disputed computer decision

452
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:46,819
and guess what -
not much has changed.

453
00:37:46,924 --> 00:37:52,246
- Last week, Rocky Balboa won...
- That's the cartoon fight I told you about.

454
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,955
Yeah.

455
00:37:54,059 --> 00:37:58,334
A stunning knockout. And keep in mind
this is taking the human factor out of it.

456
00:37:58,438 --> 00:38:01,837
- Whoa, that was beautiful.
- Rocky Balboa would be triumphant.

457
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:05,340
KO 13, and here's some of the fallout.

458
00:38:05,444 --> 00:38:09,470
What started as a form of entertainment
has now become this rallying cry

459
00:38:09,575 --> 00:38:13,178
for people who think an old-school athlete
like Balboa could be better,

460
00:38:13,282 --> 00:38:16,973
so computer technology has to create
what isn't. That's irresponsible.

461
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:19,059
Get therapy, will you?

462
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,817
Skip, how do you think Balboa
would do against Dixon?

463
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:25,318
Badly. Personally, I think Balboa
was completely overrated.

464
00:38:25,423 --> 00:38:27,401
You know he owns a restaurant.

465
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:29,947
What's the specialty?
Pounded chicken?

466
00:38:30,051 --> 00:38:32,907
I would have paid to see the fight.
Next topic, NASCAR,

467
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:37,706
and the controversy that won't go away.
Let's go back to Sunday's race.

468
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,748
Hey, hey, hey. Cheer up.
Free advertisement.

469
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:43,219
Come on. Meat house calls.

470
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:55,185
Yo, Robert.

471
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:01,769
- What are you doing out so late?
- I tried callin' but nothing was pickin' up.

472
00:39:01,874 --> 00:39:05,397
- Is something wrong?
- No, no, I just wanted to see you in person.

473
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:09,864
- You wanna come inside?
- I wanna get your opinion on something.

474
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:13,949
- Sure. Opinion on what?
- They say you only go around once, right?

475
00:39:14,054 --> 00:39:16,410
- Yeah, I've heard that.
- Well...

476
00:39:16,514 --> 00:39:19,121
I think I wanna, like, do something.

477
00:39:19,225 --> 00:39:21,175
- Like what?
- Fight.

478
00:39:22,972 --> 00:39:26,555
You know, nothing big.
Small stuff, like locally.

479
00:39:28,477 --> 00:39:31,840
Don't you think you're too, you know, old?

480
00:39:31,944 --> 00:39:35,596
You think you oughta stop tryin'
cos you had too many birthdays?

481
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,930
- I do not.
- People'll think you're crazy.

482
00:39:38,034 --> 00:39:42,063
What's crazy about standin' toe-to-toe
saying, "I am," you know?

483
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:45,188
That's just the ego talkin'.

484
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:48,899
Look, what are you tryin' to prove
to other people, Pop?

485
00:39:49,003 --> 00:39:53,987
Prove? Listen, I... I stopped thinkin'
the way other people think a long time ago.

486
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:57,449
You know, you gotta think like you think.

487
00:39:57,553 --> 00:40:00,117
- I do.
- Do you? Good.

488
00:40:00,222 --> 00:40:03,414
You gotta... you gotta face reality.

489
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:06,753
OK? It's... it's a different world now.

490
00:40:06,857 --> 00:40:09,422
Only the clothes is different.

491
00:40:11,228 --> 00:40:14,313
I really don't know what you want from me.

492
00:40:14,774 --> 00:40:19,601
I just want us to get involved,
you know, like a home team.

493
00:40:21,614 --> 00:40:27,108
Look, whatever it is,
whatever you're going through, it'll pass.

494
00:40:27,212 --> 00:40:31,987
- Yeah, you're probably right.
- Time, it's gonna catch up to all of us.

495
00:40:32,091 --> 00:40:36,579
- Especially if you're standin' still.
- Hey, come on.

496
00:40:38,464 --> 00:40:41,880
Look, I'm gonna call you in the morning.

497
00:40:43,594 --> 00:40:46,080
- Did you tell your kid?
- I did.

498
00:40:46,184 --> 00:40:48,460
- He think you're nuts?
- Yeah.

499
00:40:48,565 --> 00:40:51,466
Well, he don't believe in you?

500
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,424
Welcome to my world, buddy.

501
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,762
Rocko, nobody's givin' you no title shot.

502
00:40:57,867 --> 00:41:00,306
I know that.
I don't want one.

503
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,894
So this isn't a mental disturbance?

504
00:41:04,031 --> 00:41:05,396
No.

505
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,021
You're mad because
they took down your statue?

506
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:10,199
No.

507
00:41:11,747 --> 00:41:15,526
- Not really, no.
- If it's about money,

508
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:21,961
just hang a sign around your neck saying,
"Punch me, $5." You'll make big money.

509
00:41:23,634 --> 00:41:26,090
What? You haven't peaked yet?

510
00:41:26,929 --> 00:41:29,420
- Peaked?
- Yeah, peaked.

511
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,253
I don't know. There's still
some stuff in the basement.

512
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,559
- What basement?
- In here.

513
00:41:36,731 --> 00:41:40,676
- Tell me about the stuff.
- What about it?

514
00:41:40,781 --> 00:41:46,143
- Tell me about the stuff inside. Is it angry?
- Angry?

515
00:41:46,247 --> 00:41:50,941
- Are you mad because Adrian left you?
- She didn't leave, Paulie. She died.

516
00:41:51,045 --> 00:41:52,910
OK. OK, OK, OK.

517
00:41:57,501 --> 00:42:01,197
You know, some...
sometimes it's hard to breathe.

518
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:05,204
You know, I feel, like, this beast inside me.

519
00:42:05,308 --> 00:42:07,998
It's OK, Rocko.
Please, it's OK.

520
00:42:08,103 --> 00:42:11,630
Is it... OK?

521
00:42:16,979 --> 00:42:20,675
I... I just never knew
it was supposed to be this hard.

522
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:25,152
It wasn't supposed to be like this,
Paulie, you know?

523
00:42:33,663 --> 00:42:37,441
- You wanna come by and help me train?
- I got a job here.

524
00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:39,656
I understand.

525
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,869
Remember you said if you stay one place
long enough you become that place?

526
00:42:44,973 --> 00:42:47,202
Rocko, this is all I got.

527
00:42:47,306 --> 00:42:50,551
I understand, Paulie. I do.

528
00:42:54,725 --> 00:42:59,509
Well, if you get time and maybe come down
and see me train, I'd appreciate it.

529
00:42:59,614 --> 00:43:01,645
Of course, Rocko.

530
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,642
Bye, Paulie.

531
00:43:06,747 --> 00:43:08,730
Goodbye, Rocko.

532
00:43:11,492 --> 00:43:13,485
Take care, Rocko.

533
00:43:18,874 --> 00:43:23,824
This plenary session of the Pennsylvania
Athletic Commission is convened

534
00:43:23,928 --> 00:43:28,289
in order to consider
the application of Rocky Balboa

535
00:43:28,393 --> 00:43:32,752
for the issuance of a discretionary
professional boxing licence

536
00:43:32,856 --> 00:43:37,586
due to his ineligibility
to be licensed as a matter of right.

537
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,719
Mr Balboa, you are welcome here.
Since you're representing yourself,

538
00:43:41,823 --> 00:43:45,011
we invite you to make
an opening statement if you'd like to.

539
00:43:45,115 --> 00:43:47,806
No, I'm just curious how I did, that's all.

540
00:43:47,911 --> 00:43:52,559
All right. Well, the medical advisory board
has informed us

541
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,566
that the tests to which
you have been subjected,

542
00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:59,107
you've passed these tests with flying colours.

543
00:43:59,212 --> 00:44:02,486
- And we congratulate you for that.
- Thanks.

544
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:06,530
However, this commission
in good conscience

545
00:44:06,635 --> 00:44:08,784
cannot recommend you for a licence,

546
00:44:08,888 --> 00:44:12,252
and we therefore deny your application.

547
00:44:13,763 --> 00:44:16,543
- Didn't I do what you asked?
- Yes, you did.

548
00:44:16,647 --> 00:44:19,974
- So I should get a licence, right?
- Not exactly.

549
00:44:22,939 --> 00:44:26,468
So why'd you give me all them tests
if you was never passin' me?

550
00:44:26,572 --> 00:44:29,053
We've got to stand by our decision here,

551
00:44:29,157 --> 00:44:33,981
and we have to deny your request
for a licence at this time.

552
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:49,366
- Yo, don't I got some rights?
- What rights are you referring to?

553
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:53,205
- Like in that official paper they wrote.
- That's the Bill of Rights.

554
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:56,626
Don't it say something
about goin' after what makes you happy?

555
00:44:56,731 --> 00:44:59,797
No, that's the pursuit of happiness.
What's your point?

556
00:44:59,902 --> 00:45:03,006
I'm pursuing something
and nobody looks happy about it.

557
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:05,673
But we're just looking out for your interests.

558
00:45:05,777 --> 00:45:09,635
But maybe you're lookin' out
for your interests just a little bit more.

559
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:13,348
You shouldn't ask people to come
and pay the freight on somethin',

560
00:45:13,453 --> 00:45:16,439
they pay, they're still not good enough.
Is that right?

561
00:45:16,543 --> 00:45:20,396
Maybe you're doin' your job,
but why you gotta stop me from doin' mine?

562
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:24,320
If you're willin' to go through the battling
to get to where you wanna get,

563
00:45:24,424 --> 00:45:26,199
who's got the right to stop you?

564
00:45:26,303 --> 00:45:29,989
Maybe you guys got something
you never finished, you really wanna do,

565
00:45:30,093 --> 00:45:34,412
you never said to somebody - something!
You're told no after you pay your dues.

566
00:45:34,516 --> 00:45:38,878
Who's got the right to tell you that? Nobody!
It's your right to listen to your gut.

567
00:45:38,982 --> 00:45:45,142
It ain't nobody's right to say no after you
earned the right to do what you wanna do!

568
00:45:48,357 --> 00:45:52,558
You know, the older I get, the more things
I gotta leave behind. That's life.

569
00:45:52,663 --> 00:45:58,526
The only thing I'm asking you guys
to leave on the table is what's right.

570
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,581
Yo! Have you seen the paper today?

571
00:46:16,686 --> 00:46:19,124
Front row. Front row.

572
00:46:19,229 --> 00:46:21,086
That is so great.

573
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:24,257
- All right, all right.
- You know what? Let's go get some food.

574
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:27,637
- Come on, come on. Hey!
- Robert, come on.

575
00:46:28,439 --> 00:46:33,262
The last pay-per-views were in the toilet.
You're not makin' championship money.

576
00:46:33,366 --> 00:46:35,430
There's a bunch of nobodies out there.

577
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:38,438
I wanna talk to you
about an interesting opportunity.

578
00:46:38,542 --> 00:46:42,439
Look at me. You heard Rocky Balboa
applied for a licence and got one, yeah?

579
00:46:42,544 --> 00:46:44,523
- Yeah. Forget about it.
- Hear me out.

580
00:46:44,627 --> 00:46:48,029
You want me to fight a guy I can beat
with both hands behind my back?

581
00:46:48,134 --> 00:46:51,655
Everybody knows you can beat the guy,
but that's not what it's about.

582
00:46:51,759 --> 00:46:55,117
It's about money. We gotta capitalise
on that computer fight.

583
00:46:55,221 --> 00:46:57,913
This could do a million buys.
15, 20 million to you.

584
00:46:58,018 --> 00:47:01,168
- Forget about it.
- Then what do you wanna do?

585
00:47:01,272 --> 00:47:04,127
- Look, man, we got guaranteed fights.
- We don't.

586
00:47:04,231 --> 00:47:07,466
You wanna do this now, I'll do it now.
We got nothing, Mace.

587
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:11,091
All the fights you come up with
all got rejected. You know why?

588
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:15,308
They're all bums out there. Nobody cares
about them. There's no marquee value.

589
00:47:15,412 --> 00:47:19,393
But this Balboa thing is interesting
because... Listen to me.

590
00:47:19,497 --> 00:47:23,481
It's a has-been-never-gonna-be world.
Call it nostalgia if you want,

591
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:25,525
but people can relate to that stuff.

592
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,152
- This is a no-lose. It's all good.
- Good for who?

593
00:47:28,256 --> 00:47:31,406
For you! Not for me, for you!
Maybe you don't understand.

594
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:35,197
People don't like you no more.
They're not supporting you any more.

595
00:47:35,302 --> 00:47:37,200
Don't you understand that?

596
00:47:37,305 --> 00:47:41,539
Don't look at me like I'm messin' with your
legacy. Every jock thinks they got a legacy.

597
00:47:41,643 --> 00:47:44,123
A legacy is what you get
instead of getting paid.

598
00:47:44,227 --> 00:47:46,882
- Hey, don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
- I'm not.

599
00:47:46,986 --> 00:47:50,589
Everybody knows you could kick
this old man's ass, but you don't.

600
00:47:50,693 --> 00:47:54,678
You leave him with a bit of dignity.
So they say, "Mason's got compassion."

601
00:47:54,783 --> 00:47:59,143
"He's a decent guy." You got a whole new
audience who'll double your money.

602
00:47:59,248 --> 00:48:03,394
- Want a new image? That's how you get it.
- To replace the one that you two made?

603
00:48:03,499 --> 00:48:06,190
Wait. We made your world green.
You made the rest.

604
00:48:06,294 --> 00:48:10,149
- You made all this junk happen.
- I've had it up to here with this mess, man.

605
00:48:10,253 --> 00:48:14,656
- I'm goin' back to Martin's gym.
- All right, we'll talk about this crap.

606
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,292
I want Martin back.
There's nothing to talk about.

607
00:48:28,017 --> 00:48:29,920
- How you doin'?
- What a surprise.

608
00:48:30,024 --> 00:48:34,553
I was drivin' around the neighbourhood.
I thought, "Why not drive by and say hello?"

609
00:48:34,657 --> 00:48:37,390
- Do you wanna come inside?
- The dog needs exercise.

610
00:48:37,494 --> 00:48:39,471
- Do you want to take a walk?
- Yeah.

611
00:48:39,575 --> 00:48:42,139
- It's nice outside.
- All right.

612
00:48:42,244 --> 00:48:44,809
- Nice and brisk.
- When did you get a dog?

613
00:48:44,913 --> 00:48:47,395
We picked up Punchy a couple of days back.

614
00:48:47,499 --> 00:48:50,236
Punchy. You named a dog Punchy?

615
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:54,571
- Actually, your kid come up with the name.
- Yeah? I think that's disrespectful.

616
00:48:54,675 --> 00:48:56,867
No, no, it's fine, really, no.

617
00:48:56,971 --> 00:49:00,037
It's easy to remember,
and it's all that, you know.

618
00:49:00,142 --> 00:49:03,246
What do you think about
comin' over to the restaurant?

619
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:07,123
- What for?
- Well, you know, for, like... for work.

620
00:49:07,227 --> 00:49:09,920
The hostess is gonna be having a kid.
You'd do good.

621
00:49:10,025 --> 00:49:12,715
- I don't know.
- I'm telling you, you'd do good.

622
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:16,136
I appreciate what you're doin' for my kid,
but I can't.

623
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,683
Hey, listen. I think you'd like it a lot.
It's a nice environment. It's very pleasant.

624
00:49:20,787 --> 00:49:22,984
Can we drop it?

625
00:49:25,157 --> 00:49:26,811
What's botherin' you?

626
00:49:26,915 --> 00:49:31,565
- Nothin'. It's all right. I gotta get back.
- No, it ain't all right.

627
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:33,446
- Oh, come on.
- What?

628
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,821
I'm the first person people see?

629
00:49:35,925 --> 00:49:39,575
Yeah. You just give out menus,
say hello, sit people down.

630
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:42,663
Look, little Marie, if I can do it,
anybody can do it.

631
00:49:42,768 --> 00:49:46,166
You could find ten better people,
100 better people for this job.

632
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:50,169
- Give it a try. Like, two weeks.
- I don't wanna try.

633
00:49:50,273 --> 00:49:52,546
- Who put this stuff in your head?
- Nobody.

634
00:49:52,651 --> 00:49:56,143
Well, it just don't get in there by itself.

635
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:00,313
Thanks for comin' by.

636
00:50:02,028 --> 00:50:06,645
Yo. When was the last time you went dancin'?
Has it been a while?

637
00:50:06,749 --> 00:50:10,020
- Why are you askin'?
- Cos you're dancin' around these problems,

638
00:50:10,124 --> 00:50:15,319
you might as well dance with me. I ain't that
good, but I'm better than the average bear.

639
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:19,450
- And where that came from, I don't know.
- You're crazy.

640
00:50:19,554 --> 00:50:24,451
A little bit. But the way you're thinkin',
the way you're talkin', it's a little crazy too.

641
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:28,207
Come on. You deserve better.
Really. Come on over.

642
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:32,794
I need you to class my place up.
Philly needs you.

643
00:50:32,898 --> 00:50:36,505
And if you say, "Screw you, creepo," again
I totally understand,

644
00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:41,176
but I warn you, I'm gonna put myself, like,
geographically in the middle of the street

645
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,389
and stand here, me and Punchy,
wave to the first bus and say:

646
00:50:44,493 --> 00:50:48,977
"Come over here and mash me, cos Marie
turned down the job at the restaurant."

647
00:50:49,081 --> 00:50:51,522
- "She thinks she's better than us."
- Oh, yeah?

648
00:50:51,626 --> 00:50:54,694
Well, there hasn't been
a bus down here in 20 years.

649
00:50:54,798 --> 00:50:56,828
- Yeah?
- No.

650
00:50:58,709 --> 00:51:00,536
That was a close call.

651
00:51:01,587 --> 00:51:04,118
Listen, seriously.

652
00:51:04,222 --> 00:51:06,920
Come on over. It'll be nice.

653
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,212
All right.

654
00:51:28,948 --> 00:51:30,822
Paulie!

655
00:51:33,744 --> 00:51:35,867
Sorry, Paulie.

656
00:51:36,998 --> 00:51:38,990
Sorry.

657
00:52:09,947 --> 00:52:13,061
How are you?
Get my unusual up there.

658
00:52:13,165 --> 00:52:16,105
Excuse me.
Deliveries are in the back.

659
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:19,944
- I'm not a delivery guy.
- Well, do you have a reservation?

660
00:52:20,048 --> 00:52:22,911
Do I look like a freakin' Indian?

661
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:27,831
Hey, Rock. Rocky?

662
00:52:32,762 --> 00:52:35,753
I think we got a little bit of a problem
with this guy.

663
00:52:35,857 --> 00:52:38,878
A problem?
No, no, he's just a relative.

664
00:52:38,982 --> 00:52:40,636
OK.

665
00:52:43,564 --> 00:52:44,679
Yo, Paulie.

666
00:52:46,943 --> 00:52:48,845
- What happened to your eye?
- I hit it.

667
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:51,067
- Why?
- Needed to.

668
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:54,602
- What happened?
- I'm celebratin', Rock.

669
00:52:54,707 --> 00:52:57,026
- Why?
- I retired.

670
00:52:57,495 --> 00:52:59,609
Retired?

671
00:52:59,714 --> 00:53:01,698
Yeah?

672
00:53:04,293 --> 00:53:09,833
So when'd they start giving retired people
meat instead of watches, Paulie?

673
00:53:12,093 --> 00:53:14,381
I don't need a watch.

674
00:53:15,721 --> 00:53:17,752
I got a watch!

675
00:53:17,857 --> 00:53:20,757
- You gave me a watch!
- Paulie...

676
00:53:20,861 --> 00:53:23,722
I don't need a goddamn watch.

677
00:53:25,106 --> 00:53:27,727
- Yo, Paulie.
- I got a watch!

678
00:53:29,568 --> 00:53:31,561
I got two watches!

679
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:34,064
Yo, Paulie!

680
00:53:46,377 --> 00:53:49,074
Yo, Paulie.

681
00:53:49,179 --> 00:53:50,825
Rock.

682
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:57,211
It takes guts to climb back in that ring
knowin' you're gonna take a beating.

683
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:03,419
- You're gonna do all right, Rocko.
- How do you know that?

684
00:54:03,523 --> 00:54:06,306
The stuff in the basement.

685
00:54:16,991 --> 00:54:18,984
Thanks, Paulie.

686
00:54:23,581 --> 00:54:25,573
OK?

687
00:54:27,835 --> 00:54:30,033
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah. Good. How are you?

688
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:34,701
- Oh, yeah, fine. This is great.
- Some guys over there wanna talk to you.

689
00:54:34,806 --> 00:54:36,793
- OK.
- OK?

690
00:54:41,015 --> 00:54:43,674
- Thanks for comin' by.
- No problem. Our pleasure.

691
00:54:43,778 --> 00:54:46,465
- You wanna hear some stories?
- What kind?

692
00:54:46,569 --> 00:54:50,508
- A lot of people like to hear fight stories.
- Maybe later.

693
00:54:50,612 --> 00:54:55,059
I'm Lou DiBella. This is LC Luco.
He's Mason Dixon's manager.

694
00:54:55,163 --> 00:54:58,025
- Will you sit down and join us?
- Sure.

695
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:03,818
We have the promotional contract for
Mason Dixon - who's a big fan, by the way.

696
00:55:03,922 --> 00:55:06,988
When he heard you were interested
in fighting, he thought,

697
00:55:07,092 --> 00:55:13,115
why not try and work something out? Like
a special event, a first-class exhibition fight.

698
00:55:13,219 --> 00:55:15,783
- Why me?
- He respects the hell outta you.

699
00:55:15,887 --> 00:55:20,833
And that computer fight got people curious.
This could be very interesting.

700
00:55:20,937 --> 00:55:24,293
But I ain't interested in getting
mangled and embarrassed.

701
00:55:24,397 --> 00:55:26,628
No, that's not gonna happen. Never.

702
00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:33,175
Truthfully, I was thinkin'
more on a, like, minuscule small level.

703
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,139
You know, small fights.
Not big fights. Small fights.

704
00:55:36,243 --> 00:55:39,350
Things that... Local.
You know what I mean? Not...

705
00:55:39,455 --> 00:55:41,685
Not a bad idea.
But don't think of it as big.

706
00:55:41,789 --> 00:55:45,192
Think of it like an exhibition,
as a glorified sparring session.

707
00:55:45,296 --> 00:55:49,444
And here's something you'll like -
we'll donate a portion of the gate to charity.

708
00:55:49,548 --> 00:55:53,576
- Well, that's always nice.
- It's good to give.

709
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,786
- Where is it taking place?
- Las Vegas.

710
00:55:55,890 --> 00:56:00,166
Las Vegas. Nice and warm.
This cold's gotta be killin' you.

711
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:01,313
A little stiff.

712
00:56:01,396 --> 00:56:03,792
- You move better when you're warmer.
- Yeah.

713
00:56:03,897 --> 00:56:07,502
And if nothing else,
you'll have new stories to tell.

714
00:56:07,607 --> 00:56:10,510
- I really gotta think about this.
- Absolutely.

715
00:56:10,614 --> 00:56:12,885
- Is that OK?
- I understand. No problem.

716
00:56:12,989 --> 00:56:16,595
- I'm gonna go. You can order something.
- What do you recommend?

717
00:56:16,699 --> 00:56:18,852
It's all edible.

718
00:56:20,656 --> 00:56:22,649
OK. Thanks.

719
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:27,730
We got him. Imagine if Dixon
met this bastard in his prime.

720
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:29,573
- He'd kill him.
- No kiddin'.

721
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:32,951
Man, I'm confused.

722
00:56:40,551 --> 00:56:45,207
- I didn't think this would come along.
- But this is what you wanted, right?

723
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:49,085
You know, I talk and I talk and sometimes
I think what I'm saying is true,

724
00:56:49,189 --> 00:56:53,553
and then, you know, I look at myself
and I'm not even sure what is true any more

725
00:56:53,657 --> 00:56:58,431
cos it's like I push this crazy idea about
fightin'... I mean, what's it all about?

726
00:56:58,536 --> 00:57:01,602
Do I care about standin' toe-to-toe
and all that stuff?

727
00:57:01,707 --> 00:57:05,310
Or like my kid says, is it just, like, ego?

728
00:57:05,415 --> 00:57:09,233
Or am I this old pug who's just tryin'
to replace old pain with new pain?

729
00:57:09,337 --> 00:57:11,999
I don't know. I-I don't know.

730
00:57:13,709 --> 00:57:16,617
Look, I know I usually don't say a lot.

731
00:57:16,722 --> 00:57:20,830
I'm always listenin' and lookin' and...

732
00:57:20,934 --> 00:57:25,081
But, you know, who you are, you know,
the part of you that's so full of life,

733
00:57:25,185 --> 00:57:28,171
I mean, we all have that feeling, that fire,

734
00:57:28,275 --> 00:57:32,799
but we usually never get a chance to use it
and then it just goes away.

735
00:57:32,903 --> 00:57:36,674
But you can.
You've got this opportunity, so do it.

736
00:57:36,778 --> 00:57:42,268
Why not? I mean, this is who you are,
you know? This is who you'll always be.

737
00:57:42,372 --> 00:57:45,892
And you don't move aside for nobody
until you're ready to move.

738
00:57:45,997 --> 00:57:48,855
And it doesn't matter
how this looks to other people.

739
00:57:48,959 --> 00:57:52,701
All that matters is how it looks to you.

740
00:57:53,374 --> 00:57:55,821
Rocky.

741
00:57:55,925 --> 00:57:58,919
Rocky, look at me.

742
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:02,707
How it looks to you.

743
00:58:03,676 --> 00:58:07,999
And if this is something that you wanna do
and if this is something that you gotta do,

744
00:58:08,103 --> 00:58:10,422
then you do it.

745
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:13,675
Fighters fight.

746
00:58:16,772 --> 00:58:19,394
You're not gonna punch me, are you?

747
00:58:22,737 --> 00:58:27,853
All right, listen. I gotta go before I wear out
my welcome. I'll see you tomorrow.

748
00:58:27,957 --> 00:58:30,109
Thanks.

749
00:58:39,962 --> 00:58:41,955
Fighters fight, right?

750
00:58:48,554 --> 00:58:52,461
It's rare when you get to promote an event
that's bigger than boxing. This is.

751
00:58:52,565 --> 00:58:56,504
Skill versus will,
with part of the proceeds going to charity.

752
00:58:56,608 --> 00:59:00,843
The brainchild of Mason Dixon,
to honour past heavyweight champions.

753
00:59:00,948 --> 00:59:05,265
Warriors like Rocky Balboa.
Let's open it up for questions.

754
00:59:05,369 --> 00:59:09,731
A few great fighters have fought
in their 50s with disastrous results.

755
00:59:09,835 --> 00:59:14,277
Why risk the danger and embarrassment?
The smart money says you have no chance.

756
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:19,655
A puncher always has a chance.
This fight will be competitive.

757
00:59:19,759 --> 00:59:21,905
Why are you doing this, Rocky?

758
00:59:22,009 --> 00:59:26,244
I don't know.
I'd rather do something I love badly than...

759
00:59:26,348 --> 00:59:31,709
Than... than to feel bad
by not doin' something you love.

760
00:59:31,813 --> 00:59:34,427
The press has labelled you
a Balboasaurus.

761
00:59:35,726 --> 00:59:37,879
How do you feel about that?

762
00:59:37,984 --> 00:59:42,218
Mason, say the following happens.
You win, we'll say you beat an old guy.

763
00:59:42,322 --> 00:59:45,807
You lose, say a thumb in the eye,
you'll be the joke of the decade.

764
00:59:45,911 --> 00:59:48,184
You all know that'd never happen.

765
00:59:48,288 --> 00:59:54,607
This is only an exhibition. Don't go tryin'
to make more of this than that computer tried.

766
00:59:54,711 --> 00:59:58,360
Isn't this sport in enough trouble
without circus events?

767
00:59:58,465 --> 01:00:00,322
Next question.

768
01:00:00,426 --> 01:00:04,574
This looks like a cheap bit
of ring theatre between a has-been

769
01:00:04,678 --> 01:00:07,996
and a man whose own credible legacy
and popularity is in doubt.

770
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,872
- What's the upside?
- Doubt? Upside?

771
01:00:10,976 --> 01:00:13,878
I mean... What do you mean, upside?

772
01:00:13,982 --> 01:00:16,345
I mean, what do I have to do?

773
01:00:17,643 --> 01:00:21,173
I'm 33 and 0, with 30 knockouts.
I'm doin' you people a favour.

774
01:00:21,277 --> 01:00:25,179
I'm havin' this exhibition for you,
and you gonna make a mockery out of me?

775
01:00:25,283 --> 01:00:28,976
I'm the champ. I mean,
I get pissed, this guy get hurt.

776
01:00:29,739 --> 01:00:31,612
See you at the fight.

777
01:00:35,703 --> 01:00:39,487
The guy's a joke.
He's gonna get crushed.

778
01:00:46,881 --> 01:00:48,663
Oh, look who's here.

779
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:52,830
- How you doin'? Have you seen my father?
- He's in the back.

780
01:00:52,935 --> 01:00:55,376
We've never served this many meals.

781
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,553
And you're doin' good?
You're enjoyin' everything, right?

782
01:01:01,354 --> 01:01:03,512
Excuse me.

783
01:01:04,565 --> 01:01:06,846
How you doin'?

784
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,806
- Glad you come by.
- Can I talk with you?

785
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:12,656
- Sure.
- Can we do it outside?

786
01:01:17,411 --> 01:01:20,486
- You're going through with this?
- I start training tomorrow.

787
01:01:20,591 --> 01:01:23,778
Hey, Rock.
I made some connections.

788
01:01:23,882 --> 01:01:27,367
I can make some money on this.
Endorsements.

789
01:01:27,471 --> 01:01:29,578
- Absolutely. Do that.
- Thank you.

790
01:01:29,682 --> 01:01:32,076
- Sure.
- OK.

791
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:35,622
- So you nervous about the fight?
- Yeah, scared to death.

792
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:38,546
- You don't look scared.
- Well, I ain't supposed to.

793
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:41,127
Then you don't have to do it.

794
01:01:41,231 --> 01:01:43,385
Yeah, well, I think I do.

795
01:01:46,565 --> 01:01:49,845
You know, living with you,
it hasn't been easy.

796
01:01:49,949 --> 01:01:52,641
People see me but they think of you.

797
01:01:52,746 --> 01:01:55,563
With this going on,
it's gonna be worse than ever.

798
01:01:55,667 --> 01:01:57,644
- It don't have to be.
- Sure it does.

799
01:01:57,749 --> 01:02:00,568
- Why? You got a lot goin' on, kid.
- What, my last name?

800
01:02:00,672 --> 01:02:04,986
That's the reason I got a decent job,
why people deal with me in the first place.

801
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:10,950
Now I start to get a little ahead, to get a little
something for myself, and this happens.

802
01:02:11,055 --> 01:02:14,872
Now, I'm asking you as a favour
not to go through with this, OK?

803
01:02:14,976 --> 01:02:17,749
This is only gonna end up
bad for you and bad for me.

804
01:02:17,853 --> 01:02:20,671
- You think I'm hurtin' you?
- Yeah. In a way you are.

805
01:02:20,776 --> 01:02:24,673
- It's the last thing I ever wanted to do.
- I know that's not what you wanna do,

806
01:02:24,778 --> 01:02:28,300
but that's just the way that it is.
Don't you care what people think?

807
01:02:28,404 --> 01:02:32,933
Doesn't it bother you that people make you
out to be a joke and I'll be included in that?

808
01:02:33,037 --> 01:02:35,060
Do you think that's right?

809
01:02:35,164 --> 01:02:37,232
Do you?

810
01:02:42,204 --> 01:02:44,735
You ain't gonna believe this,

811
01:02:44,839 --> 01:02:47,234
but you used to fit right here.

812
01:02:47,339 --> 01:02:49,571
I'd hold you up and say to your mother:

813
01:02:49,675 --> 01:02:52,329
"This kid's gonna be
the best kid in the world."

814
01:02:52,433 --> 01:02:55,786
"This kid's gonna be somebody
better than anybody ever knew."

815
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:58,748
And you grew up good and wonderful.

816
01:02:58,852 --> 01:03:02,087
It was great just watching.
Every day was like a privilege.

817
01:03:02,191 --> 01:03:06,300
Then the time come for you to be your own
man and take on the world, and you did.

818
01:03:06,405 --> 01:03:11,428
But somewhere along the line,
you changed. You stopped bein' you.

819
01:03:11,533 --> 01:03:15,055
You let people stick a finger in your face
and tell you you're no good,

820
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:18,811
and when things got hard, you started
lookin' for somethin' to blame.

821
01:03:18,915 --> 01:03:20,900
Like a big shadow.

822
01:03:22,578 --> 01:03:27,362
I'll tell you something you already know.
The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.

823
01:03:27,466 --> 01:03:31,365
It's a very mean and nasty place.
And I don't care how tough you are,

824
01:03:31,469 --> 01:03:35,580
it will beat you to your knees
and keep you there permanently if you let it.

825
01:03:35,684 --> 01:03:39,792
You, me, or nobody
is gonna hit as hard as life.

826
01:03:39,897 --> 01:03:42,002
But it ain't about how hard you hit.

827
01:03:42,106 --> 01:03:45,711
It's about how hard you can get hit
and keep movin' forward.

828
01:03:45,815 --> 01:03:49,089
How much you can take
and keep movin' forward.

829
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:51,929
That's how winnin' is done!

830
01:03:52,034 --> 01:03:54,804
If you know what you're worth,
get what you're worth,

831
01:03:54,908 --> 01:03:58,310
but you gotta be willin' to take the hits
and not pointin' fingers,

832
01:03:58,414 --> 01:04:02,523
sayin' you ain't where you wanna be
because of him or her or anybody!

833
01:04:02,628 --> 01:04:04,771
Cowards do that, and that ain't you!

834
01:04:04,876 --> 01:04:06,910
You're better than that!

835
01:04:13,546 --> 01:04:16,953
I'm always gonna love you no matter what,

836
01:04:17,058 --> 01:04:19,247
no matter what happens.

837
01:04:19,352 --> 01:04:22,373
You're my son and you're my blood.

838
01:04:22,478 --> 01:04:25,141
You're the best thing in my life.

839
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:32,429
But until you start believin' in yourself,
you ain't gonna have a life.

840
01:04:35,026 --> 01:04:37,896
Don't forget to visit your mother.

841
01:05:27,411 --> 01:05:30,081
- Yeah, those are beautiful.
- Yeah.

842
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:35,124
- You get off early from work?
- No.

843
01:05:35,586 --> 01:05:38,421
I left. I quit.

844
01:05:39,924 --> 01:05:42,538
Quit? Why?

845
01:05:42,642 --> 01:05:45,543
I wasn't very...

846
01:05:45,647 --> 01:05:50,710
I don't know. I just...
I didn't... I didn't fit in there.

847
01:05:50,814 --> 01:05:53,265
I understand.

848
01:05:56,941 --> 01:06:00,144
- So what are you gonna do?
- Right now?

849
01:06:01,696 --> 01:06:05,029
Right now I'd rather be with you.

850
01:06:06,659 --> 01:06:08,817
That all right?

851
01:06:09,996 --> 01:06:11,733
Yeah.

852
01:06:11,837 --> 01:06:16,160
It's been a long time since I've seen a fight.

853
01:06:26,637 --> 01:06:32,170
You know all about fightin' so there's
no sense us goin' down that road again.

854
01:06:32,274 --> 01:06:35,055
To beat this guy, you need speed.

855
01:06:35,521 --> 01:06:38,135
You don't have it.

856
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:41,927
And your knees can't take the poundin',
so hard runnin' is out.

857
01:06:42,032 --> 01:06:44,014
And you got arthritis in your neck,

858
01:06:44,118 --> 01:06:47,770
and you've got calcium deposits
on most of your joints,

859
01:06:47,874 --> 01:06:50,187
so sparrin' is out.

860
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:52,439
I had that problem.

861
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:57,738
So what we'll be callin' on
is good old-fashioned blunt-force trauma.

862
01:06:57,842 --> 01:07:02,702
Horsepower. Heavy-duty, cast-iron,
pile-drivin' punches

863
01:07:02,807 --> 01:07:06,328
that will have to hurt so much
they'll rattle his ancestors.

864
01:07:06,432 --> 01:07:12,587
Every time you hit him with a shot, it's gotta
feel like he tried kissin' the express train.

865
01:07:12,692 --> 01:07:16,515
Yeah! Let's start buildin'
some hurtin' bombs.

866
01:07:48,678 --> 01:07:53,138
- You'll get it. You'll get it.
- You can do it, Rocko.

867
01:08:27,466 --> 01:08:29,755
Gettin' stronger!

868
01:08:47,069 --> 01:08:48,564
Come on, Rocko!

869
01:08:56,037 --> 01:08:58,235
Come on, come on.
There you go.

870
01:08:58,339 --> 01:08:59,825
There you go.

871
01:09:03,628 --> 01:09:06,628
You can do it, Rocko.

872
01:09:08,174 --> 01:09:10,843
Gettin' stronger!

873
01:09:11,344 --> 01:09:12,536
Three.

874
01:09:12,641 --> 01:09:14,297
Four. Five.

875
01:09:47,546 --> 01:09:49,539
Yeah!

876
01:09:58,933 --> 01:10:02,717
Rocky Balboa, 217.

877
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:07,345
The undisputed heavyweight champion
Mason Dixon,

878
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:10,359
221.

879
01:10:12,738 --> 01:10:17,649
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it, champ. Thanks a lot.

880
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,369
- You know how much money is in this?
- A lot.

881
01:10:34,474 --> 01:10:37,831
Imagine tryin' to clean this place.
No, seriously.

882
01:10:37,935 --> 01:10:39,923
Balboa.

883
01:10:42,101 --> 01:10:44,881
You guys, I'll catch up with you all later, OK?

884
01:10:44,985 --> 01:10:47,434
Robert, I want you to hang with me.

885
01:10:48,566 --> 01:10:51,816
- How you doin', champ?
- I'm good.

886
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:55,389
There's no reason
for neither one of us to get hurt.

887
01:10:55,494 --> 01:11:00,645
I'll do my best to carry you, make sure
you save face. There'd be no embarrassment.

888
01:11:00,749 --> 01:11:03,691
But I promise you, if you try to press me,

889
01:11:03,796 --> 01:11:10,154
you hit me, you hurt me, you hit me low,
cheap-shot me, I'll get you outta there.

890
01:11:10,258 --> 01:11:14,372
You know, a lot of people
come to Vegas to lose. I didn't.

891
01:11:14,476 --> 01:11:17,913
- It's already over.
- Ain't nothin' over till it's over.

892
01:11:18,017 --> 01:11:21,345
- What's that from? The '80s?
- That's probably the '70s.

893
01:11:25,227 --> 01:11:28,136
Just remember what I said.

894
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,300
Hey, yo, champ.

895
01:11:30,405 --> 01:11:33,013
Yo, ain't you a little scared?

896
01:11:33,118 --> 01:11:34,984
I don't get scared.

897
01:11:38,115 --> 01:11:44,319
I think you try a little harder when you're
scared. This is what has worked for me.

898
01:11:45,081 --> 01:11:47,401
- I ain't scared.
- You ain't scared of me?

899
01:11:47,505 --> 01:11:51,544
Come on, let's see what you got.
Hey, don't hit me, I'm brittle.

900
01:12:07,228 --> 01:12:09,048
- Hey.
- Hi.

901
01:12:09,153 --> 01:12:11,805
- I hope I didn't wake you.
- No. You wanna come in?

902
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,347
No. It's OK.

903
01:12:13,452 --> 01:12:18,642
I just wanted to - I don't know - come by
and wish you good luck for tomorrow.

904
01:12:18,747 --> 01:12:22,601
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Um... I brought you something.

905
01:12:22,706 --> 01:12:27,274
I hope you don't mind.
I took it from the restaurant.

906
01:12:27,378 --> 01:12:29,237
Adrian.

907
01:12:29,342 --> 01:12:31,947
Yeah. I thought she would
keep you safe, you know.

908
01:12:32,052 --> 01:12:36,753
- Yeah, she always brought me luck.
- Yeah.

909
01:12:37,258 --> 01:12:43,041
Yeah. Listen, I wanted to say thanks
for everything you've done for me and my kid.

910
01:12:43,145 --> 01:12:44,966
You've been great.

911
01:12:49,353 --> 01:12:51,512
You know, tomorrow...

912
01:12:52,732 --> 01:12:58,764
you're gonna prove that the last thing
to age in somebody is their heart.

913
01:12:58,868 --> 01:13:01,061
- I'll try.
- You go show 'em.

914
01:13:01,165 --> 01:13:03,149
Thank you.

915
01:13:23,888 --> 01:13:27,833
The heavyweight championship
has been one of sport's most coveted titles

916
01:13:27,938 --> 01:13:29,754
for 120 years.

917
01:13:29,858 --> 01:13:33,714
Two-time heavyweight champion
Rocky Balboa, the Philadelphia slugger,

918
01:13:33,819 --> 01:13:39,181
renowned for his cast-iron jaw,
ferocious body attack and will of steel,

919
01:13:39,285 --> 01:13:42,602
which have carried the smaller fighter
to numerous victories

920
01:13:42,707 --> 01:13:45,478
against physically superior opponents.

921
01:13:45,582 --> 01:13:48,484
And Mason Dixon,
the current heavyweight title holder,

922
01:13:48,589 --> 01:13:51,776
with all the speed and determination
any fighter could want.

923
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:55,992
But many still question whether
he has the heart of a true champion,

924
01:13:56,096 --> 01:14:00,704
never having been pushed to go the distance.
Tonight, we find out.

925
01:14:00,808 --> 01:14:04,040
We're at the Mandalay Bay Events Center
in Las Vegas, Nevada,

926
01:14:04,145 --> 01:14:08,171
for the much-anticipated showdown
between Mason "The Line" Dixon

927
01:14:08,275 --> 01:14:11,673
and Rocky "The Italian Stallion" Balboa.

928
01:14:11,777 --> 01:14:14,594
I'm Jim Lampley, with Larry Merchant
and Max Kellerman,

929
01:14:14,698 --> 01:14:16,925
live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel, Las Vegas,

930
01:14:17,029 --> 01:14:21,558
where we anticipate one of the most
compelling events in boxing history -

931
01:14:21,662 --> 01:14:25,349
the current unappreciated
heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon,

932
01:14:25,454 --> 01:14:27,314
putting his reputation on the line

933
01:14:27,418 --> 01:14:31,444
against legendary ex-ex-ex-champion,
Rocky Balboa.

934
01:14:31,548 --> 01:14:34,863
Even though most see this
as a glorified sparring session,

935
01:14:34,967 --> 01:14:36,945
the energy in the room is electric.

936
01:14:37,049 --> 01:14:39,242
Why is this billed as an exhibition?

937
01:14:39,347 --> 01:14:43,418
A wild guess - so they wouldn't
have to call it an execution.

938
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:51,047
Zechariah 4:6 says, "It is not by strength,
not by might, but by his Spirit."

939
01:14:51,151 --> 01:14:56,803
We have already claimed the victory
in our Lord Jesus Christ.

940
01:14:56,907 --> 01:15:01,061
- Good luck, Rocky.
- Thanks, Spider. I appreciate it.

941
01:15:12,288 --> 01:15:16,444
Nobody's expecting much, I think,
from the way-past-his-prime former champ

942
01:15:16,548 --> 01:15:17,705
Rocky Balboa.

943
01:15:18,169 --> 01:15:21,454
Rock, I gotta talk to you.

944
01:15:22,214 --> 01:15:28,918
Look. Look, I know you got a lot of stuff
you gotta get out of your system, huh?

945
01:15:29,022 --> 01:15:31,250
Tonight you do it. Right?

946
01:15:31,354 --> 01:15:33,629
Get rid of the damn beast.

947
01:15:33,733 --> 01:15:36,589
Let it be done once and for all.

948
01:15:36,694 --> 01:15:39,178
Please, I love you.

949
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:53,576
There go the lights. The buzz is building
toward a roaring crescendo.

950
01:16:08,302 --> 01:16:10,500
Where'd that come from?

951
01:16:10,605 --> 01:16:13,597
I chose it. I love Sinatra.

952
01:16:14,141 --> 01:16:16,339
He's very good, Sinatra.

953
01:16:16,444 --> 01:16:18,642
- Let's go.
- Very good.

954
01:16:21,315 --> 01:16:26,183
And here comes Rocky Balboa,
a veteran of the wars,

955
01:16:26,287 --> 01:16:29,020
here for one more last hurrah.

956
01:16:29,124 --> 01:16:32,190
Or the Last Supper,
with him as the main course.

957
01:16:32,294 --> 01:16:34,982
What's that music?
You can't be serious.

958
01:16:35,086 --> 01:16:37,942
"High Hopes"?
Talk about wishful thinking.

959
01:16:38,047 --> 01:16:42,197
Maybe "no hopes" is more realistic.
Anyway, the crowd likes it.

960
01:16:42,301 --> 01:16:45,619
Look at the Italian Stallion!
Cool and relaxed.

961
01:16:45,723 --> 01:16:49,455
Rocky's an off-the-board underdog
and they don't care at all.

962
01:16:49,559 --> 01:16:53,625
This is about his pride
and dignity and his punch, guys.

963
01:16:53,729 --> 01:16:56,292
The last thing to go is a guy's punch.

964
01:16:56,396 --> 01:16:59,808
Rocky always has that puncher's chance.

965
01:17:03,941 --> 01:17:08,181
Rocky Balboa is still,
as you can hear, the people's champion.

966
01:17:08,285 --> 01:17:12,685
Prediction - for two rounds,
Dixon's gonna have his hands full.

967
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:17,855
Two whole rounds?
We have a cockeyed optimist in the house.

968
01:17:17,959 --> 01:17:21,446
- How you doin'?
- The crowd wants to see something real.

969
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:26,365
Jim, Rocky Balboa just asked me how
I'm doing. Now, I grew up watching this guy.

970
01:17:26,469 --> 01:17:29,123
I never thought I'd be calling one of his fights.

971
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:31,875
This is unbelievable.
I'm a fan. I can't help it.

972
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,804
Now here comes Mason Dixon.

973
01:18:08,965 --> 01:18:11,579
Dixon establishing
his presence in the ring,

974
01:18:11,683 --> 01:18:15,371
and suddenly now a conversation
breaking out at the ringside.

975
01:18:15,475 --> 01:18:18,169
Mike Tyson calling out
Mason "The Line" Dixon.

976
01:18:18,273 --> 01:18:23,676
- You can't call the shots. I'm the champ.
- You're not doin' nothin'. This is charity!

977
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:28,729
And you got that...
you got that midget with you right there.

978
01:18:31,404 --> 01:18:33,141
Ladies and gentlemen,

979
01:18:33,245 --> 01:18:36,019
welcome to the Mandalay Bay Resort

980
01:18:36,123 --> 01:18:39,063
and Casino of Las Vegas,

981
01:18:39,168 --> 01:18:42,736
and a special main event of the evening,

982
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:46,072
ten rounds of heavyweight excitement

983
01:18:46,177 --> 01:18:48,866
sanctioned by
the Nevada State Athletic Commission.

984
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:54,412
And when the bell rings, the referee
in charge of the action, Joe Cortez.

985
01:18:54,516 --> 01:18:57,789
And now, for the thousands in attendance

986
01:18:57,894 --> 01:19:01,667
and the millions watching around the world,

987
01:19:01,772 --> 01:19:03,754
ladies and gentlemen,

988
01:19:03,858 --> 01:19:09,393
let's get ready to rumble!

989
01:19:11,736 --> 01:19:16,520
Introducing first, fighting out of
the blue corner, wearing black with gold,

990
01:19:16,624 --> 01:19:19,856
official weight 217lb.

991
01:19:19,961 --> 01:19:22,815
His professional record: 57 victories,

992
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:27,863
including 54 knockouts,
with 23 defeats and one draw.

993
01:19:27,967 --> 01:19:31,284
He is the fighting pride of Philadelphia,

994
01:19:31,389 --> 01:19:35,832
the two-time heavyweight
champion of the world,

995
01:19:35,936 --> 01:19:38,080
"The Italian Stallion"

996
01:19:38,184 --> 01:19:43,085
Rocky

997
01:19:43,189 --> 01:19:45,342
Balboa!

998
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:50,982
I hope he gets his head busted.

999
01:19:52,068 --> 01:19:53,977
Shut up.

1000
01:19:56,739 --> 01:20:01,190
Across the ring, fighting out of the red corner,
wearing white with blue,

1001
01:20:01,295 --> 01:20:03,688
official weight 221lb.

1002
01:20:03,792 --> 01:20:06,024
He has a perfect professional record,

1003
01:20:06,129 --> 01:20:12,239
consisting of 33 bouts, 33 victories,
including 30 knockouts.

1004
01:20:12,343 --> 01:20:17,576
Originally from Tampa, Florida,
but now fighting out of Las Vegas, Nevada,

1005
01:20:17,681 --> 01:20:22,083
the reigning, undisputed, undefeated

1006
01:20:22,187 --> 01:20:25,211
heavyweight champion of the world

1007
01:20:25,315 --> 01:20:33,139
Mason "The Line" Dixon!

1008
01:20:37,113 --> 01:20:38,895
All right, gentlemen.

1009
01:20:38,999 --> 01:20:42,397
All right, Mason, Rocky. We went over
the rules in the dressing room.

1010
01:20:42,501 --> 01:20:44,063
I expect a good, clean fight.

1011
01:20:44,168 --> 01:20:48,613
Watch the kidney punches, rabbit punches,
those low blows. Be careful with those.

1012
01:20:48,717 --> 01:20:52,615
Give me good sportsmanlike conduct.
Remember, I'm fair but I'm firm.

1013
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:54,615
- Touch 'em up.
- Enjoy the ride.

1014
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:57,744
The champ is not in the best shape
we've seen him in.

1015
01:20:57,848 --> 01:21:00,122
Maybe he just plans to phone this one in.

1016
01:21:00,226 --> 01:21:02,539
- That wouldn't be a surprise.
- Love you.

1017
01:21:02,643 --> 01:21:05,463
One thing about Rocky
we know for sure,

1018
01:21:05,567 --> 01:21:08,044
this guy's showing up in shape.

1019
01:21:08,148 --> 01:21:11,257
- The old man's crazy.
- He's gotta be crazy. He's in here.

1020
01:21:11,362 --> 01:21:14,552
You just take it easy.
This is an exhibition. Do it to him.

1021
01:21:14,656 --> 01:21:16,182
Three rounds to set a pace.

1022
01:21:16,286 --> 01:21:18,597
- Every time you hit him, make a dent.
- Got it.

1023
01:21:18,701 --> 01:21:23,524
The moments before a Rocky Balboa fight?
I can't believe it's here.

1024
01:21:24,785 --> 01:21:29,985
Round one begins. If old George Foreman
shocked the world with one punch

1025
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:32,197
why can't old Rocky Balboa?

1026
01:21:32,301 --> 01:21:34,907
As much excitement
as there is in the arena,

1027
01:21:35,011 --> 01:21:37,246
there's a sense of foreboding as well.

1028
01:21:41,594 --> 01:21:45,207
And now Mason "The Line" Dixon
goes to work with his jab,

1029
01:21:45,311 --> 01:21:49,251
as though he's fighting the number one
challenger in the heavyweight division.

1030
01:21:49,356 --> 01:21:51,672
This is to be expected early on.

1031
01:21:51,776 --> 01:21:57,931
You knew the champ was gonna control the
distance with his jab, his height, his range.

1032
01:21:58,035 --> 01:22:01,224
Balboa, looking to get in a shot,
misses wildly!

1033
01:22:01,328 --> 01:22:03,558
Did you like that?

1034
01:22:03,663 --> 01:22:06,982
It looks like a speed bag
against a punching bag.

1035
01:22:07,086 --> 01:22:11,023
Rocky's frustrated - he came
out of retirement to get into a fight.

1036
01:22:11,128 --> 01:22:15,740
Guys named Rocky don't like to be toyed
with. One punch could turn it around.

1037
01:22:15,845 --> 01:22:19,366
Apparently he forgot
his arthritis meds this morning.

1038
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:21,202
Rocky misses!

1039
01:22:21,306 --> 01:22:24,957
There's a meat-seeking missile
on the point of the chin by the champ.

1040
01:22:25,061 --> 01:22:27,879
More pinpoint jabs by Dixon.

1041
01:22:27,983 --> 01:22:31,170
There's a hard right hand,
a left and a right by Balboa.

1042
01:22:31,275 --> 01:22:34,715
He drives Dixon into the ropes
with a series of shots.

1043
01:22:34,819 --> 01:22:37,221
And the crowd goes berserk.

1044
01:22:41,821 --> 01:22:47,195
Dixon punishing Balboa
for the temerity of landing those shots.

1045
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:55,244
It's toe-to-toe in the corner,
Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.

1046
01:23:01,048 --> 01:23:05,665
Balboa landing potent combinations to the
champion's head. A wake-up call for Dixon.

1047
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:07,210
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1048
01:23:07,314 --> 01:23:08,920
- Sit down.
- Bricks in his glove.

1049
01:23:09,024 --> 01:23:11,712
- What happened to the angry stuff?
- It's still there.

1050
01:23:11,816 --> 01:23:14,507
Yeah, well, he came to battle, OK?
Listen to me.

1051
01:23:14,611 --> 01:23:17,761
If there's any bone in your body
he can break, he'll do it.

1052
01:23:17,865 --> 01:23:19,555
Give the man a little respect.

1053
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:22,597
Compubox numbers
tell the grisly story here.

1054
01:23:22,701 --> 01:23:25,974
Balboa landed nine of 13 punches
in that round.

1055
01:23:26,079 --> 01:23:31,145
Dixon landed an incredible 59 out of 69.

1056
01:23:31,249 --> 01:23:32,355
Listen to me.

1057
01:23:32,459 --> 01:23:34,985
Rocky's been here
a million times before -

1058
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:39,367
coming out to start another round
after he took a beating in the previous one.

1059
01:23:39,471 --> 01:23:41,538
I warned him. I warned him.

1060
01:23:42,632 --> 01:23:47,499
Well, he's tired.
His legs are going fast or already gone.

1061
01:23:47,603 --> 01:23:52,334
And what's truly extraordinary
is that Rocky can still take it!

1062
01:23:52,438 --> 01:23:56,923
The boxing commission, which, remember,
was criticised for licensing him,

1063
01:23:57,027 --> 01:24:01,434
would be massacred
if something happened to Rocky.

1064
01:24:05,071 --> 01:24:07,057
A monstrous straight left hand!

1065
01:24:07,161 --> 01:24:10,397
Down goes Rocky,
and that could be the end of the fight.

1066
01:24:10,501 --> 01:24:14,316
That could be the exhibition right there.
But no, Balboa up,

1067
01:24:14,421 --> 01:24:18,820
as referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants
to continue and Rocky says yes.

1068
01:24:18,924 --> 01:24:21,826
Even Balboa can be too brave
for his own good.

1069
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:25,866
Dixon comes right back to try to finish it.
Balboa almost went down.

1070
01:24:25,971 --> 01:24:27,953
Rocky shoves Dixon back.

1071
01:24:28,057 --> 01:24:30,416
As Dixon lands these brutal shots.

1072
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,750
Cover up!

1073
01:24:31,855 --> 01:24:36,215
Open shots at close range,
right and left hands, and down goes Balboa,

1074
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,385
perhaps for the last time
in his fighting career.

1075
01:24:39,489 --> 01:24:43,010
- That should do it.
- Three! Four! Five!

1076
01:24:43,114 --> 01:24:44,430
Six! Seven!

1077
01:24:44,534 --> 01:24:47,640
- Get up! Get up!
- Eight!

1078
01:24:47,745 --> 01:24:50,979
Nine!
How do you feel? You OK?

1079
01:24:51,083 --> 01:24:55,942
Now Rocky, furious with himself,
convinces Cortez he wants to keep fighting.

1080
01:24:56,047 --> 01:24:59,900
Dixon's pointing at the ref to end it,
Rocky saying he's fine.

1081
01:25:00,005 --> 01:25:02,864
- He wants to go on.
- Let it go! Let it go!

1082
01:25:02,968 --> 01:25:06,241
And Balboa comes back
with a left and a right,

1083
01:25:06,345 --> 01:25:10,420
and bulls Dixon into the ropes
for the second round in a row.

1084
01:25:11,846 --> 01:25:15,541
Back comes Dixon with brutal left-hand shots.
Dixon hurt his hand!

1085
01:25:15,645 --> 01:25:18,339
- Go after him!
- This is Rocky's chance.

1086
01:25:18,443 --> 01:25:20,921
The champ just hurt his hand on Rocky's hip.

1087
01:25:21,026 --> 01:25:24,717
Balboa immediately going to work
to the body. Huge right hook.

1088
01:25:24,821 --> 01:25:27,680
Balboa ripping away at Dixon's body.

1089
01:25:27,785 --> 01:25:30,186
These are big punches.

1090
01:25:33,743 --> 01:25:34,941
Yes!

1091
01:25:37,371 --> 01:25:41,823
Rocky Balboa has knocked
the reigning heavyweight champion down!

1092
01:25:41,927 --> 01:25:43,239
You hurt him!

1093
01:25:43,343 --> 01:25:48,452
Mason Dixon has never taken
this kind of punishment in his entire career.

1094
01:25:48,556 --> 01:25:52,622
Maybe he's clearing his head,
but the body shots really caved in his ribs.

1095
01:25:52,726 --> 01:25:55,667
Balboa is thinking knockout himself!

1096
01:25:55,771 --> 01:25:59,127
Another counter hook by Balboa.
Followed by two more!

1097
01:25:59,232 --> 01:26:02,135
Dixon fires back his own hooks.
Rocky's stunned.

1098
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:04,549
It's an all-out war along the ropes,

1099
01:26:04,654 --> 01:26:10,265
as round two comes to a close
amid a giant tumult in the ring.

1100
01:26:10,369 --> 01:26:12,016
Incredible.

1101
01:26:12,121 --> 01:26:14,017
Yeah, all right!

1102
01:26:14,122 --> 01:26:16,868
Welcome to Rockyland.

1103
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:22,831
- How's the hand?
- My hand's broken.

1104
01:26:24,418 --> 01:26:26,572
If we lose, it's your ass. Your ass!

1105
01:26:26,676 --> 01:26:29,495
It’ll numb up on you.
It'll numb up in three rounds.

1106
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,869
Once that hand numbs up,
Dixon's gonna be able to throw it hard.

1107
01:26:32,974 --> 01:26:37,208
- Until then, here's Rocky's chance.
- Take it to him! No reverse!

1108
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:39,127
Take the pain, champ.

1109
01:26:39,231 --> 01:26:43,087
Everybody thought this was a joke,
including me. Now nobody's laughing!

1110
01:26:43,191 --> 01:26:45,559
You go get him! Go out strong!

1111
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:00,576
Keep him off you.

1112
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:05,200
That's it! That's it!

1113
01:27:18,848 --> 01:27:21,553
You won that round.
Break him down.

1114
01:27:26,439 --> 01:27:28,597
Bomb him! Bomb him!

1115
01:27:34,405 --> 01:27:36,978
Yeah!

1116
01:27:39,285 --> 01:27:42,037
Just keep throwin' them bombs.

1117
01:27:53,382 --> 01:27:54,461
Come on.

1118
01:28:02,099 --> 01:28:04,092
You can do this.

1119
01:28:05,186 --> 01:28:07,262
Rocky! Rocky!

1120
01:28:16,405 --> 01:28:18,279
Get him! Go!

1121
01:29:15,881 --> 01:29:18,207
Go through him.
Run over him.

1122
01:29:33,149 --> 01:29:35,106
Unload on him!

1123
01:29:36,235 --> 01:29:38,394
Dig down, Mason!

1124
01:29:49,123 --> 01:29:53,324
- They're leaving nothing on the table.
- The fans are standing.

1125
01:29:53,428 --> 01:29:55,821
They may not be able to sit down for a week.

1126
01:29:55,926 --> 01:29:58,830
- You're doin' great.
- I'm doin' better than I thought.

1127
01:29:58,934 --> 01:30:02,787
- Are you sure he's OK?
- I've had worse.

1128
01:30:02,891 --> 01:30:06,710
Toe-to-toe, one round to go.
Who would have believed this was possible?

1129
01:30:06,815 --> 01:30:09,715
- Can you see outta that eye?
- Let me talk. Look at me.

1130
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:14,844
Don't take any more chances out there than
you have to. There's nothing more to prove.

1131
01:30:14,948 --> 01:30:18,848
- I gotta go out the way I gotta go out.
- You can do it, Rocko!

1132
01:30:18,952 --> 01:30:21,392
- One more round, we go home.
- OK, then do it.

1133
01:30:21,496 --> 01:30:27,233
There's a saying that every great champion
has one great fight left in him,

1134
01:30:27,337 --> 01:30:30,569
and Rocky is proving it so far.

1135
01:30:30,673 --> 01:30:35,698
- Come on. Touch 'em up.
- The last round of your life! The last round!

1136
01:30:35,802 --> 01:30:38,870
Come on. Touch 'em up.
Let's go. Touch 'em up.

1137
01:30:38,974 --> 01:30:42,289
- You're one crazy old man.
- You'll get there.

1138
01:30:42,393 --> 01:30:43,436
Let's go.

1139
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:48,459
Tenth round of a scheduled ten.
Who would have dreamed that Rocky Balboa

1140
01:30:48,564 --> 01:30:53,463
would still be in this "exhibition" against
the heavyweight champion of the world?

1141
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,884
You can do it! Come on!

1142
01:30:54,988 --> 01:31:00,309
This fight is as though Dixon
got on-the-job training in courage.

1143
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:03,227
- Cover up!
- They're both in a pain-free zone.

1144
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:06,147
These guys are fighting
in another dimension now.

1145
01:31:06,251 --> 01:31:11,026
Beyond belief! Balboa just walking
straight into Dixon's punches.

1146
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:13,992
Target practice for Dixon.

1147
01:31:17,003 --> 01:31:20,616
They're exchanging right hooks.
Here comes Dixon!

1148
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:24,000
He's exhausted from punching the man.

1149
01:31:24,677 --> 01:31:26,670
Knock this bum out, Mace!

1150
01:31:38,858 --> 01:31:42,931
What is it you said to the kid?
It ain't about how hard you hit.

1151
01:31:43,035 --> 01:31:47,268
It's about how hard you can get hit
and keep movin' forward.

1152
01:31:47,373 --> 01:31:51,031
How much you can take
and keep movin' forward.

1153
01:31:52,121 --> 01:31:55,113
- Get up.
- Let's go! Get up!

1154
01:31:55,217 --> 01:31:58,032
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

1155
01:31:58,136 --> 01:31:59,179
Get up.

1156
01:32:02,381 --> 01:32:04,540
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

1157
01:32:20,942 --> 01:32:25,475
Another monster body shot.
Rocky's ancestors must have felt that one.

1158
01:32:25,579 --> 01:32:29,101
- Start movin' those hands!
- Less than two minutes to go.

1159
01:32:29,205 --> 01:32:31,647
The crowd is astonished that Balboa got up.

1160
01:32:31,751 --> 01:32:34,652
- Come on! Come on!
- Turn it over! All the way through!

1161
01:32:34,756 --> 01:32:37,285
...and retaliates with fury!

1162
01:32:39,752 --> 01:32:42,124
Chop him down!

1163
01:32:44,632 --> 01:32:46,459
Come on, Rocky! Come on!

1164
01:32:48,761 --> 01:32:50,469
Take him out now!

1165
01:32:51,764 --> 01:32:53,795
They're trading shots again.

1166
01:32:53,899 --> 01:32:58,268
Balboa's trying to hit
anything and anywhere!

1167
01:32:59,605 --> 01:33:01,099
Win it! Win it!

1168
01:33:10,116 --> 01:33:12,073
Yes!

1169
01:33:20,376 --> 01:33:23,284
- You're a great champion. You got heart.
- Thanks.

1170
01:33:23,388 --> 01:33:27,163
Thanks for the opportunity.
Good man.

1171
01:33:28,301 --> 01:33:33,334
That was unbelievable.
That's the greatest thing I've ever seen.

1172
01:33:33,438 --> 01:33:36,266
That's the kind of pride
you're talking about.

1173
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:39,963
Hey, Paulie.

1174
01:33:40,068 --> 01:33:42,842
The beast is gone now.
The beast is out.

1175
01:33:42,946 --> 01:33:46,764
One of the most overused words in sports,
guys, is "incredible".

1176
01:33:46,868 --> 01:33:51,321
I hate to say it, this is incredible.

1177
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:54,324
Let's go!

1178
01:33:57,121 --> 01:34:00,778
Ladies and gentlemen,
before we go to the score cards,

1179
01:34:00,882 --> 01:34:06,664
a round of applause
for these two heavyweight warriors.

1180
01:34:11,469 --> 01:34:15,087
We have a split decision.

1181
01:34:18,059 --> 01:34:24,062
Adelaide Byrd scores it 95-94 Dixon.

1182
01:34:26,233 --> 01:34:31,820
Chuck Giampa has it 95-94 Balboa.

1183
01:34:39,956 --> 01:34:45,072
And Bill Graham scores it 95-94

1184
01:34:45,176 --> 01:34:47,738
for the winner by split decision,

1185
01:34:47,843 --> 01:34:50,324
and still undefeated,

1186
01:34:50,428 --> 01:34:53,332
the heavyweight champion of the world

1187
01:34:53,437 --> 01:34:59,797
Mason "The Line" Dixon!

1188
01:35:56,282 --> 01:36:00,445
You know I couldn't have done nothin'
without you.

1189
01:36:01,662 --> 01:36:03,869
Yo, Adrian, we did it.

1190
01:36:11,255 --> 01:36:13,248
We did it.

1191
01:41:28,781 --> 01:41:32,779
