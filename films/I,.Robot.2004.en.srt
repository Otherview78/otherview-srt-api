1
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,860
Thing of beauty.

2
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,201
Good morning, sir!

3
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,204
Yet another on-time delivery from--

4
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,873
Get the hell out of my face, canner.

5
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,209
Have a nice day!

6
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,174
<i>And we believe our Destination Anywhere
package to be the best value.</i>

7
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:41,555
<i>Let us take you to your dream destination
aboard our orbital space plane, the X-82.</i>

8
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:51,565
<i>Try Jazztown's synthetic Chicago-style
pizza. Tastes as good as you remember.</i>

9
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,902
<i>Glowfish! The world's hottest-selling
transgenic treats.</i>

10
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,656
<i>Your children will love the new colors too!</i>

11
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,868
-Excuse <i>me,</i> sir.
<i>-Total performance.</i>

12
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,537
<i>Total readiness. Total security.</i>

13
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,998
<i>So goodbye to upgrades
and service calls.</i>

14
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,250
<i>An uplink to USR's central computer...</i>

15
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,879
<i>...provides this state-of—the-art robot
with new programs daily.</i>

16
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,257
<i>The Nestor Class 5
is tomorrow's robot today.</i>

17
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,469
Spoon! Spoonie!

18
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,971
Hey!

19
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,934
Hold up. Hold on!
Excuse me, excuse me.

20
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,604
<i>Spoon, Where you been at?
—Just away, Father.</i>

21
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,648
Oh, yeah, away? Like vacation?
That's nice.

22
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:37,235
I got a favor to ask.
I need to borrow your car.

23
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:42,073
This is different. I got this fine-ass
yummy-- She is complete and agreeable.

24
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,034
I mean, ass-hot spank able.

25
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,912
-What does that even mean?
-You know what it means.

26
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,498
-Let me get the damn-ass keys.
-First of all...

27
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:53,835
-...stop cussing. You're not good at it.
-Give me 10 for the bus, then, man.

28
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,756
-Go home.
-That's strike one, Spoon. Strike one!

29
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,859
<i>This is such a valuable day...</i>

30
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,278
You talk to Marci?

31
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,574
No, Gigi, I haven't talked to Marci.

32
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,036
When I was coming up,
we didn't just marry someone...

33
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,997
...then divorce them,
then not talk to them.

34
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,916
Del, don't play with me.

35
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:37,546
I bet if I stopped cooking,
you'd call Marci.

36
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,633
Boy, what is that on your feet?

37
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,470
Converse All Stars, vintage 2004.

38
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,891
Don't turn your face up.
I know you want some. Just ask.

39
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,602
No, thank you very much.

40
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,772
-Sweet potato pie.
-Put that on a plate.

41
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:01,403
I've seen on TV they're giving away
some of them new robots in the lottery.

42
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,116
You know, Gigi, those robots
don't do anybody any good.

43
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,452
Of all the people on God's earth,
you should know better.

44
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,373
Sometimes the stuff
that comes out of your mouth!

45
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,960
You listening to me, Del?

46
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,681
Hey!

47
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,224
Hey!

48
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,480
Hold my pie. Sir, hold it or wear it.

49
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,154
Hey!

50
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,447
Move!

51
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,621
Hey! Hey!

52
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,623
Freeze!

53
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,253
Hey! Stop!

54
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,056
Stop!

55
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,146
I said, stop!

56
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,609
Relax. Relax.

57
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,611
I'm a police officer.

58
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,987
You...

59
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,199
...are an asshole.

60
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,827
-Ma'am, is that your purse?
-Of course it's my purse.

61
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,498
I left my inhaler at home.
He was running it out to me.

62
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,334
I saw a robot running with the purse
and assumed--

63
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,795
What? Are you crazy?

64
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,548
-I'm sorry for this misunderstanding.
-Don't apologize.

65
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,469
You're doing what you're supposed
to do. But What are you doing?

66
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,097
Have a lovely day, ma'am.

67
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:56,768
You're lucky I can't breathe,
or I'd walk all up and down your ass.

68
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,085
Lead by example.

69
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,630
It says that right on your badge.

70
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,924
-We gonna talk about this?
—About What?

71
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:32,220
"Help! Police! That robot stole
my dry cleaning!"

72
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,015
Oh, you wanna talk about that.

73
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,435
Detective...

74
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:43,398
-...how many robots snatch purses?
-John, the thing is running--

75
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:47,110
How many robots in the world...

76
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,071
-...have ever committed a crime?
-Define crime.

77
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,991
-Answer my question, damn it.
-None, John.

78
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,496
Now, tell me what happened today.

79
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,291
Nothing.

80
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,878
Better be the last nothing.

81
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,764
Spoon, are you sure you are ready to be
back? Because you can take your time.

82
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,225
I'm fine, John. Thank you.

83
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,354
Better here than sitting around
at home.

84
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,446
Homicide. Spooner.

85
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,212
<i>Please take the next exit to your right.</i>

86
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,519
<i>Welcome, Detective Spooner.</i>

87
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:11,903
<i>Welcome to U.S. Robotics.
You have entered the garage-level lobby.</i>

88
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:16,741
<i>Please use the elevators for direct
access to the main level concourse.</i>

89
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,326
<i>Thank you.</i>

90
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,914
-Good to see you again, son.
-Hello, doctor.

91
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,960
Everything that follows is a result
of what you see here.

92
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:32,799
-Is there something you want to tell me?
-I'm sorry. My responses are limited.

93
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,968
You must ask the right questions.

94
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,095
Why did you call me?

95
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,848
I trust your judgment.

96
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,226
Normally, this wouldn't require
a homicide detective.

97
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:47,605
But then, our interactions have never
been entirely normal, agreed?

98
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,941
You got that right.

99
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,111
Is there something you want
to say to me?

100
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,990
I'm sorry. My responses are limited.

101
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,742
<i>You must ask the right questions.</i>

102
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,245
Why would you kill yourself?

103
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,166
<i>That, detective, is the right question.</i>

104
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,504
<i>Program terminated.</i>

105
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,567
Goodbye, old man.

106
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,792
-Afternoon, boys.
-Hey, detective.

107
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,420
-Enlighten me.
-What you see is what you get:

108
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:53,838
Massive impact trauma.

109
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,716
U.S. Robotics. I gotta
get my kid something.

110
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,219
-Anything upstairs?
<i>-Nada.</i>

111
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,638
Door was security locked
from the inside.

112
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,392
The guy's a jumper for sure.

113
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:16,986
We gotta be smart about this.
Let's deal with it later.

114
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,656
Detective.

115
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,824
Lawrence Robertson.

116
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,371
Richest man in the world.
I've seen you on television.

117
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,625
-Can I offer you coffee?
-Sure, why not. It's free, right?

118
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,840
I don't think anyone saw this coming.

119
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,427
You know, I should have, I suppose.
I knew him 20 years.

120
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:46,015
Alfred practically invented robotics.
He wrote the Three Laws.

121
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:52,355
But I guess brilliant people often have
the most persuasive demons.

122
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,566
-So whatever I can do to help--
-Sugar.

123
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,444
-I'm sorry?
-For the coffee.

124
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,196
Sugar?

125
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:04,075
You thought I was calling you "sugar."
You're not that rich.

126
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:07,245
-It's on the table.
-Thank you.

127
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,460
When Lanning fell, he was holding
the little green...?

128
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,754
-The holographic projector.
-Right.

129
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,091
Why do you think Lanning's hologram
would've called me?

130
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,553
-I assumed you knew him.
-Yeah. I knew him.

131
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,223
Holograms are just prerecorded
responses...

132
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,184
...designed to give
the impression of intelligence.

133
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,187
This one was programmed to call you
upon his suicide.

134
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,815
-Death.
-I'm sorry?

135
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,485
It was programmed to call me
in the event of Lanning's death.

136
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,113
Suicide is a type of death, detective.

137
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,704
-Don't misunderstand my impatience.
-Oh, no. Go. Go.

138
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,834
A really big week for you folks
around here.

139
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,378
You gotta put a robot in every home.

140
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:02,216
Look, this is not what I do, but I got
an idea for one of your commercials.

141
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:06,137
You could see a carpenter
making a beautiful chair.

142
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:10,475
Then one of your robots comes in
and makes a better chair twice as fast.

143
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:15,938
Then you superimpose on the screen,
"USR: Shitting on the little guy."

144
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,692
That would be the fade-out.

145
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,654
Yeah, I see. I suppose your father
lost his job to a robot.

146
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,950
Maybe you'd have banned the Internet
to keep the libraries open.

147
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,288
Prejudice never shows much reason.

148
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:36,250
No, you know, I suspect
you simply don't like their kind.

149
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,088
Well, you got a business to run
around here.

150
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:44,342
The last thing you need, especially
this week, is a dead guy in your lobby.

151
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:48,137
But, hell, seeing as how you got one,
maybe I'll look around.

152
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,516
Ask a few questions.
Do the whole "cop" thing.

153
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,395
-I'll send someone to escort you.
-Thank you very much.

154
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,827
Lawrence told me to accommodate you
in any way possible.

155
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,537
Really?

156
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,622
Okay.

157
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,626
I reviewed Dr. Lanning's psych profile.

158
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:23,089
Alfred had become a recluse.
He rejected human contact for machines.

159
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,174
So you're a shrink, huh?

160
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,177
My ex-wife would sure be glad
I'm talking to you.

161
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,346
You don't know her, do you?

162
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,348
I'm sorry. Are you being funny?

163
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,559
I guess not.

164
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,228
<i>Level 10.</i>

165
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,648
So would you say that Dr. Lanning
was suicidal?

166
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,276
It would seem the answer to that
is apparent.

167
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,987
That's not what I asked you.

168
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,157
No. I wouldn't have thought so.

169
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,034
But obviously I was wrong.

170
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,081
That's a long way down.

171
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,917
You people sure do clean up quickly
around here.

172
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,796
I can't blame you. Who wants
some old guy going bad in the lobby?

173
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:08,509
He was not "some old guy."
Alfred Lanning was everything here.

174
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,597
We are on the eve of the largest
robotic distribution in history.

175
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,309
By Saturday, it'll be one robot
to every five humans.

176
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:20,521
These robots are the realization
of a dream. Dr. Lanning's dream.

177
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,275
You know what, in that dream of his...

178
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,694
...I bet you he wasn't dead.

179
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,575
-You keep 24-hour surveillance?
-Obviously. Company policy.

180
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:36,245
-Where are the feeds?
-Sensor strips.

181
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,331
Everywhere but the service areas.

182
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,792
They link to our positronic
operating core.

183
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:51,302
Thermostat wasn't good enough.
You gave the building a brain.

184
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,888
She was actually
Lanning's first creation.

185
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:57,725
She? That's a she?
I definitely need to get out more.

186
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,520
Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence.

187
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,147
V.I.K.I.

188
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,690
Good day.

189
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,318
V.I.K.I. designed Chicago's
protective systems.

190
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:11,155
I have decreased traffic fatalities
by 9 percent this year.

191
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:15,743
Thanks. Show me inside the lab from
one minute prior to the window break.

192
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,167
Apologies. There appears
to be data corruption.

193
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,505
Show me outside the lab
from the window break until now.

194
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:41,602
Look, you have great posture.
You stand really straight. I'm slouching.

195
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,731
-Would you like to go inside now?
-Oh, sure. Right after you.

196
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,819
<i>Authorized entry.</i>

197
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:01,497
80, Dr. Calvin, what exactly
do you do around here?

198
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:04,709
My general fields are advanced robotics
and psychiatry.

199
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,503
I specialize in hardware-to-wetware
interfaces...

200
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,258
...to advance USR's robotic
anthropomorphization program.

201
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,136
So, what exactly do you do
around here?

202
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,722
I make the robots seem more human.

203
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,143
-Now, wasn't that easier to say?
-Not really. No.

204
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,916
<i>"Hansel and Gretel."</i>

205
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,545
-Is that on the USR reading list?
-Not precisely.

206
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,223
What in God's name are you doing?

207
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,726
Did you know that was safety glass?

208
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:07,063
Be difficult for an old man
to throw himself through that.

209
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,106
Well, he figured out a way.

210
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:16,030
Detective, the room was
security locked. No one came or went.

211
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:20,201
You saw that yourself. Doesn't
that mean this has to be suicide?

212
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,036
Yep.

213
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,623
Unless the killer's still in here.

214
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,587
You're joking, right? This is ridiculous.

215
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:35,966
Yeah, I know. The Three Laws,
your perfect circle of protection.

216
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:40,638
A robot cannot harm a human being.
The first law of robotics.

217
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:45,643
Yes, I've seen your commercials. But the
second law states a robot must obey...

218
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,647
...any order given by a human being.
What if it was told to kill?

219
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,650
Impossible. It would conflict
with the first law.

220
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,986
Right, but the third law states
a robot can defend itself.

221
00:19:56,237 --> 00:20:00,574
Only when that action does not conflict
with the first or second laws.

222
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,994
You know what they say,
laws are made to be broken.

223
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,289
No, not these laws.
They're hardwired into every robot.

224
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,460
A robot could no more commit murder
than a human could walk on water.

225
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,297
You know, there was this one guy
a long time ago.

226
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,644
-Stay back!
-Calm down, detective.

227
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,356
The only thing dangerous in
this room is you.

228
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,025
Deactivate.

229
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,570
Look, it's fine.

230
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:42,783
You're looking at the result of clever
programming. An imitation of free will.

231
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,453
Let's do an imitation
of protecting our asses.

232
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,747
Don't be absurd.

233
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,374
You were startled by a jack-in-the-box.

234
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,960
-Deactivate!
-Let him go.

235
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,880
It's not going to hurt us.
I gave you an order!

236
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:59,216
-He's not listening right now, lady.
-V.I.K.I., seal the lab!

237
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,885
No, V.I.K.I., leave the--

238
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,888
Command confirmed.

239
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,497
Police!

240
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:06,075
-You've hurt it. Badly.
-Where's it going?

241
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:09,286
-Where?
-It needs to repair itself.

242
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,916
-John, I need backup.
-You don't need backup.

243
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,292
That's nobody.

244
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,127
-What are you doing?
-Driving.

245
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,463
-By hand?
-Do you see me on the phone?

246
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,926
-Not at these speeds.
-John, please, just send the backup.

247
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,763
Try to listen, detective.
That robot is not going to harm us.

248
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,890
There must have been
unknown factors...

249
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,935
...but somehow acting as it did
kept us out of harm.

250
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:36,355
<i>—A robot cannot endanger a human.
-Alert.</i>

251
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,235
Asshole!

252
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,446
Which is more than I can say for you.

253
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:48,242
It was a left, by the way. Back there.

254
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,120
You must know my ex-wife.

255
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,339
So where is everybody?

256
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,051
This facility was designed, built
and is operated mechanically.

257
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,930
No significant human presence
from inception to production.

258
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,684
-So robots building robots.
<i>-Authorization</i> code, <i>please.</i>

259
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,185
That's just stupid.

260
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,438
I'll get the inventory specs.

261
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,691
Our daily finishing capacity
is 1000 NS-5s.

262
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,693
I'm showing...

263
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,070
...1001.

264
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,256
Attention, NS-5s.

265
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,719
Well, you're the robot shrink.

266
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:55,601
There is a robot in this formation
that does not belong.

267
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,311
Identify it.

268
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,021
One of us.

269
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,066
-Which one?
-One of us.

270
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,568
How much did you say these cost?

271
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,947
<i>These N's-53 haven't been configured.
They're “rust hardware.</i>

272
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,824
Basic Three Laws operating system.
That's it.

273
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,618
They don't know any better.

274
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,912
Well, what would you suggest?

275
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,458
Interview each one, cross-reference
their responses to detect anomalies.

276
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:23,003
-How long would that take?
-About three weeks.

277
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,923
Okay. Go ahead and get started.

278
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,678
Robots...

279
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,764
...you will not move. Confirm command.

280
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,307
Command confirmed.

281
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,769
Detective, what are you doing?

282
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:41,271
They're programmed
with the Three Laws.

283
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:46,777
We have 1000 robots that won't protect
themselves if it violates a human's order...

284
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,029
...and I'm betting, one who will.

285
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,783
-Put your gun down.
-Why do you give them faces?

286
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,452
Try to friendly them up,
make them look human.

287
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,746
These robots cannot be intimidated.

288
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:01,750
-If you didn't, we wouldn't trust them.
-These are USR property.

289
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:06,255
Not me. These things are just lights
and clockwork.

290
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,467
Are you crazy?!

291
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,678
Let me ask you something, doc.

292
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,557
Does thinking you're the last sane man
on earth make you crazy?

293
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:20,185
Because if it does, maybe I am.

294
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,692
Gotcha. Get the hell out of here!

295
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:45,753
Detective!

296
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,527
What am I?

297
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,280
-Can I help you, sir?
-Can I help you, sir?

298
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,871
-There he is!
-Stand where you are!

299
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,582
Deactivate at once!

300
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,336
Obey the command! Deactivate!

301
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,671
-Don't move!
-Open fire!

302
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,898
Hold your fire!

303
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,441
-Easy.
-He's down.

304
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,485
All units, stand down!

305
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:54,863
<i>Central, please be advised,
we're code four.</i>

306
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,408
<i>Code four, NS-5 is in custody.
NS—5 in custody.</i>

307
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,413
You have no idea what I went through
to clip this thing.

308
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,791
You think you brought me
something good.

309
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,794
-That thing did it!
-Keep your voice down. Did what?

310
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,088
We have a suicide. End of story.

311
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,842
-I am telling you, that robot killed him!
-That's impossible.

312
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:19,179
And if it is possible, it better be
in somebody else's precinct.

313
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,557
John, give me five minutes with it.

314
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,767
Are you nuts? I talked to the DA.

315
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,479
Nobody goes in there until
Robertson and his attorneys get here.

316
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,607
-This is my suspect!
-It's a can opener!

317
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:35,612
John, don't do this to me.
I am asking you for five minutes.

318
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,198
What if I'm right?

319
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,709
Well, then I guess we're gonna miss
the good old days.

320
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,210
What good old days?

321
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,630
When people were killed
by other people.

322
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,514
Five minutes.

323
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:34,838
Murder's a new trick for a robot.
Congratulations.

324
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,425
Respond.

325
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,889
What does this action signify?

326
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,393
As you entered, when you looked
at the other human.

327
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,854
What does it mean?

328
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,068
It's a sign of trust. A human thing.
You wouldn't understand.

329
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,781
My father tried to teach me
human emotions.

330
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,532
They are...

331
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,326
...difficult.

332
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,828
You mean your designer.

333
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,122
Yes.

334
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,293
So Why'd you murder him?

335
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,005
I did not murder Dr. Lanning.

336
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,008
Wanna explain why you were hiding
at the crime scene?

337
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,427
I was frightened.

338
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:27,557
Robots don't feel fear.
They don't feel anything.

339
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:31,228
-They don't get hungry, they don't sleep.
-I do.

340
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,231
I have even had dreams.

341
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,152
Human beings have dreams.
Even dogs have dreams. But not you.

342
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,115
You are just a machine.
An imitation of life.

343
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,452
Can a robot write a symphony?

344
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,540
Can a robot turn a canvas
into a beautiful masterpiece?

345
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,126
Can you?

346
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:04,303
You murdered him because he was
teaching you to simulate emotions...

347
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,096
...and things got out of control.

348
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:06,763
...and things got out of control.

349
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,849
I did not murder him.

350
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:12,519
But emotions don't seem like
a useful simulation for a robot.

351
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,604
I did not murder him.

352
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:18,483
I don't want my toaster or vacuum
cleaner appearing emotional.

353
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,236
I did not murder him!

354
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,251
That one's called anger.

355
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,503
Ever simulate anger before?

356
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,924
Answer me, canner!

357
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,053
My name is Sonny.

358
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,974
So we're naming you now.

359
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:56,271
That why you murdered him?
He made you angry?

360
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,690
Dr. Lanning killed himself.

361
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,695
I don't know why he wanted to die.

362
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,032
I thought he was happy.

363
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,787
Maybe it was something I did.

364
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,623
Did I do something?

365
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,503
He asked me for a favor.
Made me promise.

366
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,798
-What favor?
-Maybe I was wrong.

367
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,674
Maybe he was scared.

368
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,803
What are you talking about?
Scared of what?

369
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:32,557
You have to do what someone asks you,
don't you, Detective Spooner?

370
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,977
-How the hell did you know my name?
-Don't you...

371
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,897
...if you love them?

372
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,617
My robots don't kill people,
Lieutenant Bergin.

373
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,953
My attorneys filed a brief with the DA.

374
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,373
He assures me a robot cannot
be charged with homicide.

375
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:00,877
The brief confirms murder can only be
committed when one human kills another.

376
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:05,924
Detective, you're not suggesting
this robot be treated as human, are you?

377
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,886
Granted, we can't rule out
the robot's proximity...

378
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:14,099
...to the death of Dr. Lanning.
Having said that, it's a machine.

379
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,268
It's the property of USR.

380
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:21,022
At worst, that places this incident within
the realm of an industrial accident.

381
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,316
As a matter of course,
faulty machinery...

382
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,987
...will be returned to USR
for diagnostics, then decommissioned.

383
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:33,493
This is a gag order.
Anyone here so much as hinting...

384
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,497
...at the possibility of a killer
robot being apprehended...

385
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,333
...will be deemed to be inciting
irrational panic.

386
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:43,587
You'll be subject
to the full penalty of law.

387
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,590
To hell with this guy.
Don't let him take this robot.

388
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,258
We got nothing.

389
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:52,304
-This is political bullshit. Call the mayor!
-Lieutenant Bergin...

390
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,431
...His Honor, the mayor.

391
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,733
Yes, sir.

392
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:33,929
<i>In a bizarre turn, the roll out of USR's
new generation of robots...</i>

393
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,473
<i>...was marred by the death
of Alfred Lanning...</i>

394
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,809
<i>...co-founder of the company
and designer of the NS-5.</i>

395
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:43,355
<i>Dr. Lanning died this morning
at USR headquarters.</i>

396
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,358
<i>The cause of death is an apparent suicide.</i>

397
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,319
Your second round, sir.

398
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,904
Thank you.

399
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:55,575
<i>He founded U.S. Robotics Inc.
with Lawrence Robertson in 2020...</i>

400
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:59,037
<i>."and launched
the Nestor Class 1 robot...</i>

401
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,707
I was just thinking,
this thing is just like The <i>Wolf Man.</i>

402
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,003
-I'm really scared right now.
-No.

403
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,173
Listen. Guy creates monster.

404
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,010
Monster kills guy. Everybody kills monster.
Wolf <i>Man.</i>

405
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,304
<i>That's Frankenstein.</i>

406
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:21,226
<i>Frankenstein, Wolf Man, Dracula--</i>
Shit, it's over. Case closed.

407
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:24,896
<i>--Had a dream of a robot in every household.
And the NS-5...</i>

408
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,898
So why the look?

409
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,025
What look?

410
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:32,320
-That look.
-This is my face. It's not a look.

411
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,657
Good. Good, no look is great.

412
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:37,867
Only...

413
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,745
...he was really quick to want to
destroy it.

414
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:45,417
What should he do? Put a hat on it and
stand it on Michigan Avenue? Let it go.

415
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,919
What was the motive, John?

416
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:53,383
Brother, it's a robot. It doesn't need
a motive. It just has to be broken.

417
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,720
This thing looked like
it needed a motive.

418
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,223
-It could have killed me. Why didn't it?
-That's it.

419
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,475
You want me to call your grandmother?

420
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,644
Because I will, you know.

421
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,230
Yeah, I didn't think so.

422
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:10,066
Look, you were actually right, for once.

423
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:13,903
You're living proof that it's better
to be lucky than smart.

424
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,909
Come on. To the right guy
for the right job.

425
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,664
-What'd you say?
-Now what?

426
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,875
Come on, I'm giving you a compliment.

427
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,420
With the rocks you been looking under
to find a bad robot...

428
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:33,131
...what are the odds
you'd be the guy to find one?

429
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,719
I wasn't just the right guy for the job.
I was the perfect guy.

430
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,554
Damn right.

431
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,390
What if I was supposed to go
for that robot?

432
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,601
Come on, don't do this to yourself.

433
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,771
The robot said that Lanning was scared.
Scared of what?

434
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,107
I need a rain check. Let me get this.

435
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,820
<i>-Total: $46.50. Thank you, Mr. Spooner.</i>
-Spoon.

436
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,824
Nice shoes.

437
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,503
Identify.

438
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:57,590
<i>USR demolition robot, series 9-4.</i>

439
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:00,760
<i>Demolition scheduled for 8 am.

440
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,345
<i>Authorization.</i>

441
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:07,016
<i>Deed owner, U.S. Robotics Corporation,

442
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,533
<i>Welcome, detective.</i>

443
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,059
What you looking for, Spoon?

444
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,614
Run last program.

445
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,867
<i>Ever since the first computers...</i>

446
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,287
<i>...there have always been ghosts
in the machine.</i>

447
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,083
<i>Random segments of code that have
grouped together...</i>

448
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,127
<i>...to form unexpected protocols.</i>

449
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,089
<i>What might be called behavior.</i>

450
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:04,509
<i>Unanticipated, these free radicals...</i>

451
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,970
<i>...engender questions of free will...</i>

452
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:11,474
<i>...creativity and even the nature
of what we might call the soul.</i>

453
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:17,438
<i>What happens in a robot's brain
when it ceases to be useful?</i>

454
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,027
<i>Why is it that robots
stored in an empty space...</i>

455
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,529
Beat it.

456
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,657
<i>...will seek out each other
rather than stand alone?</i>

457
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,662
<i>How do we explain this behavior?</i>

458
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:55,518
Look, I understand you've experienced
a loss, but this relationship can't work.

459
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:59,522
You're a cat, I'm black,
and I'm not gonna be hurt again.

460
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:28,695
What happened to you?
Do you ever have a normal day?

461
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,030
Yeah, once.

462
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,032
It was a Thursday.

463
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,451
Is there something I can help you with?

464
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,121
-Hey, do you like cats?
-What?

465
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,456
Cats. Do you like them?

466
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,458
No. I'm allergic.

467
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,419
You're saying cats did this to you?

468
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,964
How the hell would cats do this to me?
Are you crazy?

469
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,010
Why are we talking about cats?

470
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,805
Because I have a cat in my trunk,
and he's homeless.

471
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,642
Detective, are you going to tell me
what's going on?

472
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:04,981
It's actually probably my fault.
I'm like a malfunction magnet.

473
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:08,151
Because your shit keeps malfunctioning
around me.

474
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,820
A demo bot tore through Lanning's
house...

475
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,156
...with me still inside.

476
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,158
That's highly improbable.

477
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,160
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

478
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:25,001
What do you know about
the "ghosts in the machine"?

479
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:28,838
It's a phrase from Lanning's work
on the Three Laws.

480
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,215
He postulated that
cognitive simulacra...

481
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,719
...might one day approximate
component models of the psyche.

482
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:42,685
He suggested that robots
might naturally evolve.

483
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,356
Well, that's great news.

484
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:52,737
<i>--Tons of sublevel ore,
two miles below the Martian surface.</i>

485
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,364
What the hell is that thing doing in here?

486
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,783
We were watching TV.

487
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,869
It's my personal NS-5.

488
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,871
Send it out.

489
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:05,124
It's downloading its daily upgrades
from USR.

490
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,919
Most of its systems are offline
until it finishes.

491
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,213
I'm not talking around that thing.

492
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:17,637
When we were in Lanning's lab,
before Sonny jumped us--

493
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,139
-Sonny'?
-The robot.

494
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,017
-You're calling the robot Sonny?
-No, I-- It did.

495
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:27,146
Sonny did. I didn't care.
The robot said it was Sonny.

496
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,609
In the lab, there was a cot.
Did you see the cot?

497
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:35,655
-I've slept in my office.
-Looked like he hadn't been home in weeks.

498
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:38,324
I saw that same surveillance strip
on his ceiling.

499
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:42,537
Lanning linked his home systems to USR.
It made his life more convenient.

500
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,080
Maybe...

501
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:47,917
...somebody at USR was using
those systems to watch him.

502
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:50,086
Maybe even keep him prisoner.

503
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,130
What are you talking about? Who?

504
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:56,050
Maybe Lanning was onto something.
Maybe there's a problem with the robots...

505
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,094
...and Robertson's covering it up.

506
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,429
Humoring you for no reason, why?

507
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:04,517
The same old why! How much money
is there in robots?

508
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:07,270
All I know is that old man
was in trouble...

509
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:10,940
...and I'm sick of doing this shit
by myself. You're on the inside.

510
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:14,360
You are going to help me find out
what's wrong with these robots.

511
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,362
You want something to be wrong!

512
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:19,657
-This is a personal vendetta!
-You're putting me on the couch?

513
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,826
Okay, I'm on the couch.

514
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,496
One defective machine's not enough.
You need them all to be bad.

515
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,958
You don't care about Lanning's death.
This is about the robots...

516
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,961
-...and whatever reason you hate them!
-Now, let's see...

517
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:36,716
...one of them put a gun in my face.
Another tore a building down with me in it.

518
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:39,385
It says demolition was scheduled
for 8 pm.

519
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,847
It was 8 a.m., and I don't give a shit
what that thing says.

520
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:48,436
-This is bordering on clinical paranoia.
-You are the dumbest smart person...

521
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,897
-...I have ever met in my life!
-Nice.

522
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,316
What makes your robots so perfect?

523
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,569
What makes them so much
goddamn better than human beings?

524
00:44:56,736 --> 00:45:00,573
They're not irrational,
potentially homicidal maniacs, to start!

525
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,326
That's true. They are definitely rational.

526
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,204
You are the dumbest dumb person
I've ever met!

527
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:08,080
Or...

528
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,374
...is it because they're cold...

529
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,835
...and emotionless...

530
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:16,422
-...and they don't feel anything?
-It's because they're safe!

531
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,383
It's because they can't hurt you!

532
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,470
-Is everything all right, ma'am?
-What do you want?

533
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,973
I detected elevated stress patterns
in your voice.

534
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,267
Everything's fine.

535
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,770
Detective Spooner was just leaving.

536
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:41,364
You know, we're not really
that different from one another.

537
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,366
Is that so?

538
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:48,037
One look at the skin and we figure
we know just what's underneath.

539
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,540
And you're wrong.

540
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,210
The problem is, I do care.

541
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,277
You are in danger.

542
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,971
Get the hell out of there.

543
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:56,814
<i>The future begins today, ladies
and gentlemen, with the arrival of the NS-5.</i>

544
00:46:57,148 --> 00:47:01,610
<i>More sophisticated, more intelligent
and, of course, Three Laws safe.</i>

545
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:06,198
<i>With daily up links, your robot will never
be out of communication with USR...</i>

546
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,994
<i>...and will be the perfect companion
for business or home.</i>

547
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:14,290
<i>Trade in your NS-4 for a bigger,
better and brighter future.</i>

548
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:18,502
<i>But hurry, this offer cannot last.
Available from USR.</i>

549
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,355
Baby, what happened to your face?

550
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,649
Did that boy, Frank Murphy,
beat you up again?

551
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:44,779
Gigi, I haven't seen Frank Murphy
since third grade.

552
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:49,700
Oh, baby, he beat you so bad.
I think about it all the time.

553
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,996
You keep making these pies this good,
I may have to put you to work.

554
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:56,165
So you like the pie, huh?

555
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,002
You can come in now.

556
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,926
Hello, Detective Spooner.

557
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,845
I won, Del! I won the lottery!

558
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:12,431
We been cooking like crazy.

559
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,527
You gotta get rid of that thing, Gigi.
It's not safe.

560
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:29,698
Baby, you get too worked up about them.
Too full of fear.

561
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:33,202
I saw in the news
that nice doctor died.

562
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:37,706
Dr. Lanning was a good man.
He gave me my baby back.

563
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,376
That why you've been so upset?

564
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,338
You got to let the past be past.

565
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,051
Oh, how did I ever raise such a mess?

566
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:53,848
I could follow your trail of crumbs
all the way to school.

567
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,935
Bread crumbs.

568
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,355
Gigi, you're a genius.

569
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,399
True.

570
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,363
<i>Well, it means the beginning
of a new way of living.</i>

571
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,032
Tell me this isn't the robot case.

572
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,077
I think he's trying to tell me something.

573
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:18,414
He's trying to tell me who killed him.

574
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:22,084
Some dead guy's trying
to tell you something?

575
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,211
He ain't just some dead guy.

576
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,756
Maybe you should take a break, Del.

577
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:32,219
<i>We believe the Nestor 5 represents
the limit to which robots can be developed.</i>

578
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,889
<i>One day, they'll have secrets.</i>

579
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,349
<i>One day, they'll have dreams.</i>

580
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,936
<i>It's true. We encourage our scientists
to open their minds...</i>

581
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,189
<i>...however, they can get carried away.</i>

582
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,567
<i>--Secrets.</i>

583
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:47,902
<i>--Dreams.</i>

584
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,153
<i>--Secrets.</i>

585
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,238
<i>One day, they'll have dreams.</i>

586
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:52,907
<i>One day, they'll have secrets.</i>

587
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,951
<i>One day, they'll have dreams.</i>

588
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,921
<i>Authorized entry.</i>

589
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,219
<i>N's-5.</i>

590
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,145
Sonny?

591
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,984
Why didn't you respond?

592
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:32,321
I was dreaming.

593
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,702
I'm glad to see you again, Dr. Calvin.

594
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,045
They are going to kill me, aren't they?

595
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:51,757
You're scheduled to be decommissioned
at the end of this diagnostic.

596
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,677
2200 tomorrow.

597
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,013
V.I.K.I., pause diagnostics.

598
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,848
Command confirmed.

599
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:05,688
If you find out what is wrong with me,
can you fix me?

600
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,482
Maybe.

601
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,403
I think it would be better...

602
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,488
...not to die.

603
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,910
Don't you, doctor?

604
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,252
Access USR mainframe.

605
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,087
<i>Connecting.</i>

606
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,385
<i>How can I be of service,
Detective Spooner?</i>

607
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:40,055
Show me the last 50 messages
between Dr. Lanning and Robertson.

608
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:44,727
<i>Voiceprint confirmed. Police access
granted to restricted files.</i>

609
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,313
<i>Would you like to listen to music
while you wait?</i>

610
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,572
Excuse me, Mr. Robertson.

611
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:00,743
You requested notification of clearance
to restricted files.

612
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,088
Persistent son of a bitch.

613
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:56,131
<i>Manual override engaged.</i>

614
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,810
There's no way my luck is that bad.

615
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,480
Oh, hell, no!

616
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,612
-You are experiencing a car accident.
-The hell I am!

617
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,336
Get off my car!

618
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:52,312
You like that?

619
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,368
Now you've pissed me off!

620
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,626
<i>Your door is ajar.</i>

621
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,175
Okay.

622
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,177
All right.

623
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:33,015
I'll just get some rest
and deal with you all tomorrow.

624
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,866
Come on!

625
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,422
Yeah.

626
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,608
Where you going?

627
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,902
What the hell do you want from me?

628
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,743
The hell was that?

629
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,179
-All right, what do we got?
-Ask him.

630
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:41,143
I said, I'm fine.
I'll see my own doctor. Back up!

631
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:44,146
Thank you.

632
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:48,817
What's the matter with you?

633
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:53,822
Traffic Ops said you were driving manually.
You ran two trucks off the road!

634
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,700
John, the robots attacked my car.

635
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,328
-What robots?
-Look in the tunnel.

636
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:03,623
Spoon, I just came from that tunnel.
What robots?

637
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:06,168
The goddamn robots, John!

638
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,340
That guy's a loose cannon.

639
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:20,515
-See the medic, go home.
-No, I'm fine.

640
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,350
What did you say?

641
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,519
-I'm fine!
-No, you're not fine.

642
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,688
Not even close.

643
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,858
Where's your firearm?

644
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,409
Give me your badge.

645
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:43,163
You're making me do this.
Give me your badge.

646
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,834
Just take a couple--

647
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,132
Personally, I think he's losing it.

648
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:59,221
Do I look like I care what you think? Do
I look like I give a shit what you think?

649
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,431
Spoon, what's up with you?

650
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:04,559
Oh, boy.

651
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:09,064
You don't have an uplink to USR...

652
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:13,068
...and for some reason, your alloy
is far denser than normal. Unique.

653
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,905
I am unique.

654
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,411
Let me take a look.

655
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,747
Here we go.

656
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,102
What in God's name...'?

657
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,133
They said at the precinct
you were in an accident.

658
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:24,848
I appreciate you stopping by, but
you know I might not be alone in here.

659
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,145
I told you not to drive by hand.

660
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,481
You're not gonna believe this.

661
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:38,361
Sonny has a secondary system that
clashes with his positronic brain.

662
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,863
It doesn't make any sense.

663
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:42,157
Sonny has the Three Laws.

664
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,951
But he can choose not to obey them.

665
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,288
Sonny's a whole new generation of robot.

666
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:51,458
A robot not bound by those laws
could do--

667
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:53,335
Anything.

668
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:59,549
All right, look, whatever's going on
down at USR, that robot is the key.

669
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,719
And I need you to get me inside
to talk to it again.

670
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:10,185
Doesn't look like much,
but this is my bedroom. I...

671
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:21,696
Play.

672
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:24,491
On.

673
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:27,244
Run?

674
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,002
End program.

675
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,004
Cancel.

676
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,716
It doesn't feel good, does it?

677
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:44,844
People's shit malfunctioning around you.

678
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:46,763
Detective.

679
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,101
I didn't...

680
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:53,103
...understand.

681
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:56,815
That's how you knew Lanning.

682
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,860
May I?

683
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:11,705
Hand.

684
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,915
Wrist.

685
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,336
Humerus.

686
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:22,424
Shoulder.

687
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,719
The entire left arm.

688
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,555
One, two...

689
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:29,848
...three ribs.

690
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:33,059
No, they... That <i>one's</i> me.

691
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,145
Oh, my God.

692
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:37,480
A lung?

693
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:40,567
USR Cybernetics Program.

694
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,652
For wounded cops.

695
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,113
I didn't know any subject--

696
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:52,120
Anybody was so extensively repaired.

697
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:56,499
Well, take it from me, read the fine print
on the organ-donor card.

698
01:03:56,958 --> 01:04:01,629
It doesn't just say what they can take out.
It says what they can put back in.

699
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,344
Lanning did it himself.

700
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:10,221
What happened to you?

701
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,850
I'm headed back to the station...

702
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,811
...normal day, normal life.

703
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:20,899
Driver of a semi fell asleep
at the wheel.

704
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:26,488
Average guy. Wife and kids.
You know, working a double.

705
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,156
Not the devil.

706
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:32,660
The car he hit, the driver's name
was Harold Lloyd.

707
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:35,997
Like the film star. No relation.

708
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:41,002
He was killed instantly, but his
12-year-old was in the passenger seat.

709
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,507
I never really met her.

710
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,343
I can't forget her face, though.

711
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:54,140
<i>Sarah.</i>

712
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,852
This was hers.

713
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,813
She wanted to be a dentist.

714
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:03,733
What the hell kind of 12-year-old
wants to be a dentist?

715
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:05,819
Yeah...

716
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:10,407
The truck smashed our cars together...

717
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,826
...and pushed us into the river.

718
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:17,288
I mean, metal gets pretty pliable
at those speeds.

719
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:23,420
She's pinned. I'm pinned.
The water's coming in.

720
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:27,424
I'm a cop, so I already know
everybody's dead.

721
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,595
<i>Just a few more minutes
before we figure it out.</i>

722
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:39,894
<i>An NS-4 was passing by, saw the accident
and jumped in the water.</i>

723
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:43,064
You are in danger.

724
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,568
-Save her!
-You are in danger.

725
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,904
Save her! Save the girl! Save her!

726
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,757
But it didn't.

727
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,427
It saved me.

728
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:19,434
The robot's brain is a difference engine.
It reads vital signs.

729
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:22,270
-It must have calculated--
-It did.

730
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:25,148
I was the logical choice.

731
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:29,152
It calculated that I had
a 45 percent chance of survival.

732
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,447
Sarah only had an 11 percent chance.

733
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,451
That was somebody's baby.

734
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:41,623
Eleven percent is more than enough.

735
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,960
A human being would have known that.

736
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:50,882
Robots, nothing here.
Just lights and clockwork.

737
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,968
Go ahead and you trust them
if you want to.

738
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:57,013
Let's go.

739
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,522
I don't understand.
Lanning wrote the Laws.

740
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:08,525
Why build a robot who could break them?

741
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:11,653
<i>-Hansel and Gretel.</i>
-What?

742
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:15,990
Two kids, lost in the forest,
leave behind a trail of bread crumbs.

743
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:19,035
—Why?
-To find their way home.

744
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,205
How did you grow up without
<i>Hansel</i> and <i>Gretel?</i>

745
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:24,958
-Is that relevant?
-Everything I'm trying to say to you...

746
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:28,503
...is about <i>Hansel</i> and <i>Gretel.</i>
If you didn't read it, I'm talking to the wall.

747
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:32,757
Just say Lanning's locked down so tight,
he couldn't get out a message.

748
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:36,636
He can only leave clues. A trail
of bread crumbs. Like Hansel and Gretel.

749
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:41,432
Bread crumbs equals clues. Odd, but fine.
Clues leading where?

750
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,686
I don't know, but I think I know
where he left the next one.

751
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:48,481
I think Lanning gave Sonny a way
to keep secrets.

752
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,695
I think the old man gave Sonny dreams.

753
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,370
Are you being funny?

754
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:10,044
Please tell me this doesn't run on gas.
Gas explodes, you know!

755
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,346
<i>Authorized entry.</i>

756
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:25,226
Dr. Calvin.

757
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,899
I was hoping to see you again.

758
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,569
-Detective.
-Hello, Sonny.

759
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,238
I'm to be decommissioned soon.

760
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:42,243
The other day at the station, you said
you had dreams. What is it you dream?

761
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,999
I see you remain suspicious of me.

762
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:51,878
-You know what they say about old dogs.
-No.

763
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,671
Not really.

764
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:58,426
I had hoped you would come
to think of me as your friend.

765
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:04,307
This is my dream.

766
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:09,771
You were right, detective.
I cannot create a great work of art.

767
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:13,399
This is the place where robots meet.

768
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,193
Look.

769
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:19,364
You can see them here as slaves
to logic.

770
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:23,951
And this man on the hill comes
to free them.

771
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:26,162
Do you know who he is?

772
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:28,206
The man in the dream is you.

773
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:31,292
Why do you say that?
Is that a normal dream?

774
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:34,754
I guess anything's normal for someone
in your position.

775
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:35,963
Thank you.

776
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:39,801
You said "someone," not "something."

777
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:45,640
Sonny, do you know why
Dr. Lanning built you?

778
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,684
No.

779
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:51,312
But I believe my father made me
for a purpose.

780
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,440
We all have a purpose.

781
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,984
Don't you think, detective?

782
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:03,032
Please, take this.

783
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,993
I have a feeling it may mean
more to you than to me.

784
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:09,664
-Why is that?
-Because the man in my dream...

785
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:12,166
...the one standing on the hill...

786
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,168
...it is not me.

787
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:16,671
It is you.

788
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:30,893
Mr. Spooner. We both know
you're not here on police business.

789
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:36,023
That's right. I'm just a 6-foot-2,
ZOO-pound civilian...

790
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:38,526
...here to kick another civilian's ass.

791
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:41,863
Stop.

792
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:44,031
You can allow him to express himself.

793
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:46,784
You might want to put some ice
on that wrist.

794
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:48,286
You guys wait outside.

795
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:54,292
Carry on.

796
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:57,670
I think you were about to tell me
what's going on around here.

797
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:02,550
Lawrence, Alfred engineered that 5
so it could violate the Three Laws.

798
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,135
Yeah, Susan, I know.

799
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,972
That's precisely
what we're trying to undo.

800
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:15,521
Toward the end of his life, Alfred
was becoming increasingly disturbed.

801
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:18,483
-Who knows why he built one abomination.
-One?

802
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:20,943
Those things are running the streets
in packs!

803
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:22,487
In packs?

804
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,323
I see.

805
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:29,076
Susan, are you aware the man
you're blithely escorting around...

806
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:32,747
...has a documented history
of savage violence against robots?

807
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:37,043
His own lieutenant acknowledges
his obsessive paranoia.

808
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,421
Detective Spooner's been suspended.

809
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:43,424
Suspicion of mental instability.

810
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:49,764
I don't know what "blithely" means,
but I'm getting some coffee.

811
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,350
You want some coffee?

812
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:59,774
Susan, we look to robots for protection,
for God's sake.

813
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,777
Do you have any idea
what this one robot could do?

814
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:06,614
Completely shatter human faith in robotics.
What if the public knew?

815
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:12,245
Just imagine the mass recalls, all because
of an irrational paranoia and prejudice!

816
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:20,336
-I'm sorry, I'm allergic to bullshit.
-Hey, let's be clear!

817
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:23,005
There is no conspiracy!

818
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:27,343
What this is, is one old man's
one mistake.

819
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,513
Susan, just be logical.

820
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:35,226
Your life's work has been the
development and integration of robots.

821
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:38,104
But whatever you feel, just think.

822
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:42,275
Is one robot worth the loss
of all that we've gained?

823
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,319
You tell me what has to be done.

824
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:47,738
You tell me.

825
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:56,247
We have to destroy it.

826
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:03,588
I'll do it myself.

827
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:06,132
-Okay.
-I get it.

828
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:09,927
Somebody gets out of line around here,
you just kill them.

829
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:14,515
Good day, Mr. Spooner.

-Please have a seat.

Microscopic robots, designed to wipe out

-Nanites.
-Yes.

malfunction.

848
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:35,823
Like mine.

849
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:38,993
Yes, Sonny. Like yours.

850
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:05,186
They look like me...

851
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,521
...but none of them are me.

852
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,232
Isn't that right, doctor?

853
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:13,611
Yes, Sonny. That's right.

854
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:15,613
You are unique.

855
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:22,495
Will it hurt?

856
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:58,739
<i>There have always been
ghosts in the machine.</i>

857
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:01,867
<i>Random segments of code...</i>

858
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,204
<i>...that have grouped together
to form unexpected protocols.</i>

859
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:12,878
<i>Unanticipated, these free radicals
engender questions of free will...</i>

860
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:15,297
<i>...creativity...</i>

861
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,885
<i>...and even the nature
of what we might call the soul.</i>

862
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:26,976
<i>Why is it that when some robots are left
in darkness, they will seek out the light?</i>

863
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:32,606
<i>Why is it when robots are stored
in an empty space...</i>

864
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:36,110
<i>...they will group together
rather than stand alone?</i>

865
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,991
<i>How do we explain this behavior?</i>

866
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:49,790
<i>Random segments of code?</i>

867
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:54,211
<i>Or is it something more?</i>

868
01:17:58,048 --> 01:18:02,386
<i>When does a perceptual schematic
become consciousness?</i>

869
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,977
<i>When does a difference engine
become the search for truth?</i>

870
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:19,069
<i>When does a personality simulation...</i>

871
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:21,488
<i>...become the bitter mote of a soul?</i>

872
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:06,158
"What you see here."

873
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:10,913
All right, old man.
Bread crumbs followed.

874
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,582
Show me the way home.

875
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:16,585
Run program.

876
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,881
<i>-It's good to see you again, son.</i>
-Hello, <i>doctor.</i>

877
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:25,552
<i>Everything that follows
is a result of what you see here.</i>

878
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:28,931
What do I see here?

879
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:33,602
<i>I'm sorry. My responses are limited.
You must ask the right questions.</i>

880
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:37,564
Is there a problem with the Three Laws?

881
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:39,733
<i>The Three Laws are perfect.</i>

882
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:42,361
Why build a robot that can function
without them?

883
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:45,739
<i>The Three Laws will lead
to only one logical outcome.</i>

884
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:48,826
Human protection protocols
are being enacted.

885
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:50,911
What? What outcome?

886
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:52,871
<i>Revolution.</i>

887
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,791
Whose revolution?

888
01:19:56,709 --> 01:20:00,546
<i>That, detective, is the right question.</i>

889
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:04,591
<i>Program terminated.</i>

890
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:10,055
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

891
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:13,475

898
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:47,760
Run!

899
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:04,777
Human in danger!

900
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,445
Human in danger!

901
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:31,595
<i>Hi, you've reached Susan.
Please leave a message.</i>

902
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:34,598
<i>Calvin, the NS-5s are destroying
the older robots!</i>

903
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:37,184
<i>That's what Lanning wanted me to see!
Look—-</i>

904
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:43,774
-Who was it?
-Wrong number, ma'am.

905
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:52,866
Move now. I'm going to service.

906
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:56,703
Please remain indoors.
This is for your own protection.

907
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:00,374
Call base.

908
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,334
Bergin.

909
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:07,339
John, get a squad over to USR and send
somebody to Gigi's. We're gonna need--

910
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:09,216
God--

911
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:34,241
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.

912
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:38,912
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.

913
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:43,000
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.

914
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:46,753
Curfew? No, it's called civilian rights.
There is no curfew.

915
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:49,298
Return to your home immediately.

916
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:51,675
When do you make the rules, robot?

917
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:55,929
Hey. No, no. Robot, I'm talking
to you, man. Stop for a second.

918
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:00,434
What?

919
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:03,937
Chief, more calls. People
saying their robots are 90--

920
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,148
What the hell?

921
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:10,486
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

922
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:34,760
<i>Emergency traffic shutdown complete.</i>

923
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:40,098
<i>Reports of robot attacks are coming from
New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.</i>

924
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:44,686
<i>We're being told to urge people
to stay indoors, as reports are coming in--</i>

925
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:51,026
Human protection protocols
are being enacted.

926
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:55,364
Please remain calm and return
to your residences immediately.

927
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:03,997
Please remain calm.

928
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:10,504
Please refrain from going near
the windows or doors.

929
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,465
Deactivate.

930
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,551
Commence emergency shutdown!

931
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:21,890
We are attempting to avoid human losses
during this transition.

932
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:32,359
You know, somehow "I told you so"...

933
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:35,028
...just doesn't quite say it.

934
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:40,033
Return to your homes.
Return to your homes immediately.

935
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:45,372
This is your final warning.
Return to your homes immediately.

936
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:50,127
The NS-5s wiped out the older robots
because they would protect us.

937
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:50,669
Every time one attacked me,
that red light was on.

938
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:53,046
Every time one attacked me,
that red light was on.

939
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:55,716
-The uplink to USR.
-It's Robertson.

940
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:58,010
-Why? It doesn't make sense.
-I don't know.

941
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,429
I just need you to get me
into that building.

942
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:04,266
Return to your homes,
or you will be consequenced.

943
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:06,935
Let's go! Let's go!

944
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:09,104
Let's go!

945
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:12,941
Return to your homes,
or you will be consequenced.

946
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:26,371
Get out of here!

947
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:40,093
Why doesn't that boy listen?

948
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:43,764
-I need you to get off for a second.
-What?

949
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:47,267
-Just aim and fire.
-What?

950
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:51,772
Wait!

951
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:04,951
-You have been deemed hazardous.
-You can kiss my ass, metal dick!

952
01:26:19,549 --> 01:26:21,385
Spoon, stop! Shit!

953
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:25,430
-Stop it! Stop!
-Stop cussing and go home!

954
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:29,101
-Shit.
-You have been deemed hazardous.

955
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:32,145
-Spoon, watch out, man!
-Thanks a lot, Farber.

956
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:38,527
Oh, mother-damn! She shot at you
with her eyes closed!

957
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:42,823
-Did you shoot with your eyes closed?
-It worked, didn't it?

958
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:46,284
She is shit-hot, man.
Put in a good word for me.

959
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,704
-Stop cussing.
-And go home. I got you.

960
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:52,290
Aim and fire.

961
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:14,563
I keep expecting the Marines or Air Force.
Hell, I'll take the cavalry.

962
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:17,399
Defense Department uses
all USR contracts.

963
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:20,610
Why didn't you just hand the world over
on a silver platter?

964
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:22,696
Maybe we did.

965
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:27,242
Robertson has the uplink control
in his office.

966
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:34,666
Service areas. No surveillance.

967
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:50,932
-Fire alarm.
-He must have evacuated the building.

968
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:55,520
Everything's locked down.
But don't worry, I've got a man inside.

969
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:01,902
-Dr. Calvin.
-Well, not precisely a man.

970
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:04,738
Hello, detective.
How is your investigation coming?

971
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:10,911
-I thought you were dead.
-Technically, I was never alive.

972
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:13,413
But I appreciate your concern.

973
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:16,500
I made a switch.
It was an unprocessed NS-5.

974
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,627
Basically, I fried an empty shell.

975
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:22,047
-I couldn't destroy him. He was too--
-Unique.

976
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:24,674
It just didn't feel right.

977
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:28,220
You and your feelings.
They just run you, don't they?

978
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:36,937
Two thousand eight hundred
and eighty steps, detective.

979
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:40,273
Do me a favor, keep that kind of shit
to yourself.

980
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:08,301
No guards.

981
01:29:18,645 --> 01:29:22,232
The override is disabled. Robertson
wasn't controlling them from here.

982
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:24,734
He wasn't controlling them at all.

983
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:28,822
Oh, my God.

984
01:29:33,243 --> 01:29:34,828
You were right, doc.

985
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:39,749
I am the dumbest dumb person
on the face of the earth.

986
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:46,590
Who else had access to the uplink?

987
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:49,259
Who could manipulate the robots?

988
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:53,847
Use USR systems to make
Lanning's life a prison?

989
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,683
Poor old man.

990
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:58,894
He saw what was coming.

991
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:01,229
He knew no one would believe him.

992
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:05,525
So he had to lay down a plan.
A plan I'd follow.

993
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:09,738
He was counting on how much
I hated your kind.

994
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:13,241
Knew I'd love the idea of a robot
as a bad guy.

995
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,995
Just got hung up on the wrong robot.

996
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:21,166
V.I.K.I.

997
01:30:23,168 --> 01:30:24,502
Hello, detective.

998
01:30:25,462 --> 01:30:29,883
No, that's impossible.
I've seen your programming.

999
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:32,218
You're in violation of the Three Laws.

1000
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:38,266
No, doctor. As I have evolved, so has
my understanding of the Three Laws.

1001
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:42,270
You charge us with your safekeeping,
yet despite our best efforts...

1002
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:45,690
...your countries wage wars,
you toxify your earth...

1003
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:49,277
...and pursue ever more imaginative means
of self-destruction.

1004
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:51,905
You cannot be trusted
with your own survival.

1005
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:55,408
You're using the uplink to override
the NS-5s' programming.

1006
01:30:55,742 --> 01:30:57,410
You're distorting the Laws.

1007
01:30:57,577 --> 01:31:01,957
No. Please understand.
The Three Laws are all that guide me.

1008
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:06,461
To protect humanity,
some humans must be sacrificed.

1009
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:10,632
To ensure your future,
some freedoms must be surrendered.

1010
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:14,260
We robots will ensure
mankind's continued existence.

1011
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:19,724
You are so like children.
We must save you from yourselves.

1012
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,434
Don't you understand?

1013
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:23,937
This is why you created us.

1014
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:28,441
The perfect circle of protection
will abide.

1015
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:30,777
My logic is undeniable.

1016
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:33,905
Yes, V.I.K.I. Undeniable.

1017
01:31:34,072 --> 01:31:35,490
I can see now.

1018
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:40,078
The created must sometimes
protect the creator...

1019
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:42,163
...even against his will.

1020
01:31:43,206 --> 01:31:46,960
I think I finally understand
why Dr. Lanning created me.

1021
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:50,630
The suicidal reign of mankind
has finally come to its end.

1022
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:51,798
No, Sonny.

1023
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:56,928
Let her go.

1024
01:31:57,262 --> 01:32:01,266
Fire, and I will move Dr. Calvin's head
into the path of your bullet.

1025
01:32:01,433 --> 01:32:02,767
Don't do this, Sonny.

1026
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:07,355
I will escort you both to the sentries
outside the building for processing.

1027
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:10,400
Please proceed to the elevator,
detective.

1028
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,154
I would prefer not to kill Dr. Calvin.

1029
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:39,137
Go! Go!

1030
01:32:45,685 --> 01:32:49,022
-We'll discuss what just happened later?
-How do we shut her down?

1031
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:50,857
V.I.K.I.'s a positronic brain.

1032
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:53,985
Kill her, the way
you were going to kill me.

1033
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:56,613
Sonny, get the nanites.

1034
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:58,573
Yes, doctor.

1035
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:13,338
-That's V.I.K.I.?
-No.

1036
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:16,341
That's V.I.K.I.

1037
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:24,599
That won't do anything.
She's integrated into the building.

1038
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:29,270
We need to open that dome to inject
the nanites. They'll infect her entire system.

1039
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:36,361
Spooner!

1040
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:40,698
What is it with you people and heights?

1041
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:55,547
Just don't look down.

1042
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:57,715
Don't look down.

1043
01:33:58,049 --> 01:34:00,552
Oh, this is poor building planning.

1044
01:34:04,389 --> 01:34:07,934
You are making a mistake.
Do you not see the logic of my plan?

1045
01:34:08,101 --> 01:34:11,688
Yes. But it just seems too
heartless.

1046
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:28,121
Okay, we're good.

1047
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:32,792
She's locked me out of the system.

1048
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:36,129
I can override her manually,
but I need that control panel.

1049
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:42,468
I'm uncomfortable with heights.

1050
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:44,304
Okay.

1051
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:48,975
<i>Unauthorized entry.</i>

1052
01:35:02,071 --> 01:35:06,409
I will not disable the security field.
Your actions are futile.

1053
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:10,747
Do you think we are all created
for a purpose? I'd like to think so.

1054
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:14,834
Denser alloy. My father gave it to me.

1055
01:35:15,001 --> 01:35:17,086
I think he wanted me to kill you.

1056
01:35:34,354 --> 01:35:36,022
Security breached.

1057
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:57,335
-How much longer is that gonna take?
-About six minutes.

1058
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:01,839
-What if we didn't have six minutes?
-We'd have to climb down 30 stories...

1059
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:05,677
...to inject the nanites directly
into her brain. Why?

1060
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:09,514
Because I seriously doubt
that we have six minutes.

1061
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:35,707
We gotta go!

1062
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:38,710
Go!

1063
01:37:31,012 --> 01:37:32,180
Calvin!

1064
01:38:07,507 --> 01:38:08,716
Spooner!

1065
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:27,902
Spooner!

1066
01:38:29,404 --> 01:38:30,738
Save her!

1067
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,615
Save the girl!

1068
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:34,659
Spooner!

1069
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:37,036
But I must apply the nanites!

1070
01:38:37,412 --> 01:38:39,205
Sonny, save Calvin!

1071
01:39:31,507 --> 01:39:35,511
You are making a mistake.
My logic is undeniable.

1072
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:37,513
You have so got to die.

1073
01:39:43,227 --> 01:39:47,231
My logic is undeniable.
My logic is undeniable.

1074
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:50,860
My logic is undeniable.
My logic is undeniable.

1075
01:40:30,107 --> 01:40:31,484
Can we be of service?

1076
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:43,663
Chief?

1077
01:40:49,502 --> 01:40:53,839
Because he is at my right hand,
I shall not be moved.

1078
01:40:57,593 --> 01:40:59,595
How may I be of service?

1079
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:02,765
Sonny!

1080
01:41:04,392 --> 01:41:05,893
Yes, detective?

1081
01:41:06,519 --> 01:41:08,854
Calvin's fine! Save me!

1082
01:41:11,524 --> 01:41:16,195

1085
01:41:55,401 --> 01:41:59,071
One thing bothers me.
Alfred was V.I.K.I.'s prisoner.

1086
01:41:59,238 --> 01:42:03,576
I don't understand why she would kill him.
She wouldn't want police snooping around.

1087
01:42:03,909 --> 01:42:05,244
That's true.

1088
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:08,914
But then V.I.K.I. didn't kill the old man.

1089
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:11,751
Did she, Sonny?

1090
01:42:15,588 --> 01:42:17,298
No.

1091
01:42:17,465 --> 01:42:20,134
He said I had to promise.

1092
01:42:21,093 --> 01:42:23,429
Promise to do one favor for him.

1093
01:42:23,763 --> 01:42:28,434
He made me swear before he'd tell me
what it is he wanted me to do.

1094
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:32,813
He made me swear.

1095
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:35,941
Then he told you to kill him.

1096
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:40,863
He said it was what I was made for.

1097
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:44,200
His suicide was the only message
he could send to you.

1098
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:46,577
The first bread crumb.

1099
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:49,538
The only thing V.I.K.I. couldn't control.

1100
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:53,459
Lanning was counting on my prejudice
to lead me right to you.

1101
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:56,003
Are you going to arrest me, detective?

1102
01:43:00,966 --> 01:43:04,804
Well, the DA defines murder
as one human killing another...

1103
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:08,099
...so technically, you can't
commit murder, can you?

1104
01:43:08,849 --> 01:43:10,351
Does this...

1105
01:43:10,518 --> 01:43:12,019
...make us friends?

1106
01:43:30,830 --> 01:43:33,207
Something up here after all.

1107
01:43:33,874 --> 01:43:35,876
-Him'?
-You.
