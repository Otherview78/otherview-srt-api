1
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:07,362
- Thank you. - Would you like something else?

2
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,322
No. No, no, not just yet. I'm waiting.

3
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,662
I'm expecting someone.

4
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:01,502
Would this be one of your regular haunts?

5
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:04,082
I don't have any regular haunts.

6
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,892
Let me see it.

7
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:28,902
Sometimes I imagine I still feel it around my neck.

8
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:31,652
I carried it for so many years.

9
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:34,152
How does it feel around yours?

10
00:02:35,661 --> 00:02:38,121
We can free each other of it.

11
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,791
Love to chatter, don't they, our Muggle friends.

12
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,291
Though one must admit, they make a good cup of tea.

13
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:53,171
What you're doing is madness.

14
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:56,641
It's what we said we'd do.

15
00:02:57,471 --> 00:02:59,851
- I was young. I was... - Committed.

16
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:01,391
To me.

17
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:04,021
To us.

18
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:06,811
No.

19
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,191
I went along because...

20
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:13,031
Because?

21
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:15,281
Because I was in love with you.

22
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:18,161
Yes.

23
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:22,491
But that's not why you went along.

24
00:03:23,451 --> 00:03:26,001
It was you who said we could reshape the world.

25
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:28,831
That it was our birthright.

26
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:51,901
Can you smell it? The stench.

27
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:58,241
Do you really intend to turn your back on your own kind?

28
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,031
For these animals?

29
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:06,211
With or without you, I'll burn down their world, Albus.

30
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:10,131
There's nothing you can do to stop me.

31
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:16,091
Enjoy your cup of tea.

32
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,381
She's ready.

33
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,630
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,870
Beautiful.

35
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,620
All right, you two.

36
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,670
Now, the tricky bit.

37
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,370
Accio.

38
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,349
I'm so sorry.

39
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,309
Twins.

40
00:09:57,729 --> 00:09:59,389
You had twins.

41
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,748
Leave us.

42
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:30,588
Show me.

43
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:43,138
The others, they said it was special.

44
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:45,688
Ooh, it's beyond special.

45
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:47,978
See?

46
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:50,358
See its eyes?

47
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:53,238
Those eyes see everything.

48
00:12:55,858 --> 00:13:00,578
When a Qilin is born, a righteous leader will rise to change our world forever.

49
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:08,128
Her birth brings change, Credence, to everything.

50
00:13:10,338 --> 00:13:11,548
You did well.

51
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:16,298
Go.

52
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,588
Rest.

53
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,558
There.

54
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,518
There.

55
00:14:43,677 --> 00:14:46,677
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is about, would you?

56
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:49,767
He just asked that we meet, and that I be sure to bring you.

57
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:50,937
Hmm.

58
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:52,097
Right.

59
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:09,537
Here to meet my brother, I expect.

60
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,457
No, sir. We're here to see Albus Dumbledore.

61
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,967
- That would be my brother. - Oh.

62
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:21,837
Sorry. I'm, um... Brilliant.

63
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:23,797
I'm Newt Scamander, and this is Theseus...

64
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:26,257
Up the stairs. First on the left.

65
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:40,487
Has Newt told you why you're here?

66
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,567
Was he meant to?

67
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:45,527
No. As a matter of fact.

68
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:50,117
There's something that we, uh...

69
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:53,167
That, uh, Dumbledore wishes to speak to you about.

70
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,167
It's a proposal.

71
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:00,127
All right.

72
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:04,797
You know what this is, of course.

73
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:06,257
Newt had it in Paris.

74
00:16:07,177 --> 00:16:10,057
I can't say I have much experience with such things,

75
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,887
but it looks to me to be a blood troth.

76
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,597
That would be correct.

77
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:17,397
And whose blood is contained within?

78
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:19,437
Mine.

79
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,567
And Grindelwald's.

80
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:27,327
I'm assuming that's why you can't move against him?

81
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:28,237
Yes.

82
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,827
Nor he against me.

83
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,417
Can I ask, what would possess you to make such a thing?

84
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:37,917
Love.

85
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:42,297
Arrogance. Naiveté. Pick your poison.

86
00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:46,717
We were young, we were going to transform the world.

87
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:47,967
Mm.

88
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:52,097
This ensured that we would, even if one of us had a change of heart.

89
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,767
And what would happen if you were to fight him?

90
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,867
It's really quite beautiful, you have to admit.

91
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:15,957
Were I to even think about defying it...

92
00:17:27,427 --> 00:17:29,547
It knows, you see.

93
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:35,766
Albus.

94
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,056
It senses the betrayal in my heart.

95
00:17:38,146 --> 00:17:39,476
Albus.

96
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,066
Albus.

97
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,416
That would be the least of it.

98
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:08,836
Young man's magic, but as you can see...

99
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,556
powerful magic.

100
00:18:15,016 --> 00:18:16,976
It can't be undone.

101
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:26,446
So this proposal, I take it the Qilin has something to do with it?

102
00:18:26,526 --> 00:18:28,196
He promises he won't tell a soul.

103
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,406
If we're to defeat him,

104
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:35,746
the Qilin's only part of it.

105
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:39,916
The world as we know it is coming undone.

106
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:45,876
Gellert's pulling it apart with hate, bigotry.

107
00:18:48,716 --> 00:18:53,806
Things that seem unimaginable today will seem inevitable tomorrow...

108
00:18:54,386 --> 00:18:55,966
if we don't stop him.

109
00:18:57,806 --> 00:19:00,306
Should you agree to do what I ask...

110
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:03,106
you'll have to trust me.

111
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,566
Even when every instinct tells you not to.

112
00:19:16,496 --> 00:19:17,826
Let's hear it.

113
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:47,566
Does he send you to spy on me?

114
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:49,946
No.

115
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:52,356
But he asks.

116
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:54,616
What ya thinkin', what ya feeling.

117
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:56,946
And the others?

118
00:19:57,036 --> 00:19:59,036
Does he ask what they're thinking and feeling?

119
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:02,666
Yes, but it's mostly you.

120
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,036
And do you tell him?

121
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,416
You do.

122
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:13,296
Who's reading whose mind now?

123
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:22,346
Tell me what you see.

124
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:26,896
You're a Dumbledore.

125
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:30,816
It's an important family.

126
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,605
You know this because he's told you.

127
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:38,695
He's also told you they abandoned you.

128
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:42,995
That you were a... A dirty secret.

129
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:48,205
Um... He says Dumbledore abandoned him too,

130
00:20:48,295 --> 00:20:50,205
and he knows how you feel.

131
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:53,425
And for that reason...

132
00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:56,095
he's asked you to kill him.

133
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:01,805
I want you to go now, Queenie.

134
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:07,395
I don't tell him.

135
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:11,065
Not always.

136
00:21:13,395 --> 00:21:14,945
Not everything.

137
00:22:24,305 --> 00:22:25,975
Hey, we're...

138
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:30,515
Queenie.

139
00:22:30,605 --> 00:22:32,025
Hi, sweetie.

140
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,785
Honey...

141
00:22:41,865 --> 00:22:43,535
...look at your bakery.

142
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:45,655
It's like a ghost town.

143
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,575
Yeah, well, I missed you.

144
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:50,415
Oh, baby.

145
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,085
Why don't you come here?

146
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:55,465
Come here.

147
00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:03,055
Hey.

148
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:09,395
Everything's gonna be all right.

149
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:13,685
Everything's gonna be just fine.

150
00:23:40,464 --> 00:23:43,844
Hey, sweetheart, what brings you downtown?

151
00:23:44,554 --> 00:23:48,514
I really hope you didn't spend all day coming up with that.

152
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:53,394
Oh, you want scary, is that what you want?

153
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:58,314
You know what it is, you just aren't menacing enough.

154
00:23:58,394 --> 00:24:02,234
I think I'm plenty menacing.

155
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:05,194
Am I not menacing?

156
00:24:05,284 --> 00:24:09,204
Maybe if you waved your arms around, you know, like a crazy man,

157
00:24:09,284 --> 00:24:11,744
then you'd appear more menacing.

158
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:19,624
That's good. A little more.

159
00:24:22,384 --> 00:24:24,254
A little more.

160
00:24:24,344 --> 00:24:26,214
Keep going. Perfect.

161
00:24:26,304 --> 00:24:29,764
Three, two, one.

162
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:30,844
Hey!

163
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:36,684
That's enough. Get outta here.

164
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,684
What's on your mind, baker boy?

165
00:24:38,774 --> 00:24:39,944
Ah, jeez.

166
00:24:40,024 --> 00:24:41,694
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

167
00:24:41,774 --> 00:24:42,864
Oh, well, we're not.

168
00:24:42,944 --> 00:24:44,364
It's a lady.

169
00:24:46,074 --> 00:24:47,904
I tell you what...

170
00:24:47,994 --> 00:24:49,494
I'll give you the first shot. Go ahead.

171
00:24:49,574 --> 00:24:50,574
You sure?

172
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:53,034
Oh, boy.

173
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,424
Last time I ever help that woman out again.

174
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:04,544
Lally!

175
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:07,424
Whoopsie, Frank. Sometimes I forget my own strength.

176
00:25:07,514 --> 00:25:09,844
I'll take it from here. Thank you!

177
00:25:09,924 --> 00:25:10,844
Welcome.

178
00:25:10,934 --> 00:25:13,184
- Catch you later, Lally. - Bye, Stanley.

179
00:25:13,264 --> 00:25:15,104
I'll be over for a game of Befudler Dudley soon.

180
00:25:15,184 --> 00:25:16,894
All right.

181
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,394
That's my cousin Stanley. He's a wizard.

182
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:20,394
No.

183
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:23,154
Please! It's early, don't make me work for it.

184
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:24,524
I said I wanted out, and I want out.

185
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:25,694
Come now, Mr. Kowalski.

186
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,234
Can't believe my therapist said you wizards don't exist.

187
00:25:28,324 --> 00:25:30,654
What a waste of money!

188
00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:33,034
You do know I'm a witch, right?

189
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:34,824
Yeah.

190
00:25:34,914 --> 00:25:36,414
Look...

191
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,124
...you seem like a really nice witch.

192
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,124
You don't know what I've been through with you people.

193
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:43,674
So, could you please get out of my life?

194
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:47,804
- A little over a year ago... - Oh, my...

195
00:25:47,884 --> 00:25:49,464
...in the hopes of securing a small business loan,

196
00:25:49,554 --> 00:25:51,554
you walked through the doors of the Steen National Bank

197
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:54,014
located about six blocks from here.

198
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,684
You then made the acquaintance of Newt Scamander,

199
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:59,564
the world's foremost and, albeit only, magizoologist.

200
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:00,644
You then learned of a world

201
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:02,484
you had previously been wholly unaware of.

202
00:26:02,564 --> 00:26:05,154
You met and fell in love with a witch named Queenie Goldstein,

203
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:07,194
had your brain wiped by means of Obliviation,

204
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,824
only it didn't take.

205
00:26:08,904 --> 00:26:11,494
And as a result, you reunited with Ms. Goldstein who,

206
00:26:11,574 --> 00:26:14,164
after your refusal to marry her, mm,

207
00:26:14,784 --> 00:26:17,994
decided to join Gellert Grindelwald and his dark army of followers,

208
00:26:18,084 --> 00:26:19,494
who pose the single greatest threat

209
00:26:19,584 --> 00:26:22,254
to both your world and ours in four centuries.

210
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:23,874
How did I do?

211
00:26:23,964 --> 00:26:25,374
That was good.

212
00:26:26,004 --> 00:26:28,714
Except for the part about Queenie going over to the dark side.

213
00:26:29,844 --> 00:26:33,513
I mean, yeah, she's cuckoo.

214
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:36,093
But she's got a heart bigger than this whole crazy island,

215
00:26:36,183 --> 00:26:38,053
and she's so smart, you know?

216
00:26:38,143 --> 00:26:39,893
She can legitimately read your brain, you know,

217
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,103
she's a whatchamacallit...

218
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,143
- A Legilimens. - Yeah.

219
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:48,063
Look...

220
00:26:51,573 --> 00:26:53,823
You see this?

221
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:57,283
You see the pan? That's me, I'm the pan.

222
00:26:57,743 --> 00:27:00,623
I'm all dented, dime-a-dozen. I'm just a schmo.

223
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:03,373
I don't know what kind of crazy ideas you have in your head there, lady,

224
00:27:03,453 --> 00:27:05,833
but I'm sure as hell you could do a lot better than me.

225
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:07,083
Goodbye.

226
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:09,543
I don't think we can, Mr. Kowalski.

227
00:27:11,553 --> 00:27:14,383
You could have ducked under the counter, but you didn't.

228
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:17,553
You could have looked the other way, but you didn't.

229
00:27:17,643 --> 00:27:18,683
In fact,

230
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:22,723
you were willing to put yourself in danger to save a perfect stranger.

231
00:27:23,353 --> 00:27:24,183
Seems to me

232
00:27:24,273 --> 00:27:27,023
you're just the kind of average Joe the world needs right now.

233
00:27:27,603 --> 00:27:29,443
You just don't know it yet.

234
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,733
That's why I had to show you.

235
00:27:34,193 --> 00:27:37,413
We need you, Mr. Kowalski.

236
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:44,623
All right.

237
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:46,623
Call me Jacob.

238
00:27:46,713 --> 00:27:47,793
Call me Lally.

239
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:49,133
- Lally. - Mm.

240
00:27:49,213 --> 00:27:50,463
I gotta lock up.

241
00:27:56,013 --> 00:27:56,883
Thanks.

242
00:27:56,973 --> 00:27:58,643
Much better, Jacob.

243
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:11,193
I believe you know how this works, Jacob.

244
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,273
Mm.

245
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:48,393
What did they say at the Ministry?

246
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:49,853
Liu or Santos?

247
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,653
Officially, the Ministry takes no position.

248
00:28:53,403 --> 00:28:57,153
Unofficially, smart money's on Santos.

249
00:28:57,243 --> 00:28:59,453
Although anyone would be better than Vogel.

250
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:00,783
Anyone?

251
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,753
I don't believe he's on the ballot, Kama.

252
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:09,003
He also happens to be a fugitive.

253
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:10,503
Is there a difference?

254
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,423
Spinning! Always with the spinning.

255
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,383
Jacob.

256
00:29:17,513 --> 00:29:19,173
Welcome. You brilliant man.

257
00:29:19,263 --> 00:29:20,553
Sorry.

258
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,263
I was absolutely sure that Professor Hicks would convince you.

259
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:24,683
Yeah.

260
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:28,733
You know me, pal. I can't pass up a good Portkey.

261
00:29:29,523 --> 00:29:31,313
Mr. Scamander.

262
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:32,862
Professor Hicks.

263
00:29:32,942 --> 00:29:34,062
- At long last. - At long last.

264
00:29:35,272 --> 00:29:38,572
So, Professor Hicks and I, we've corresponded for many years,

265
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:39,902
but we've never actually met.

266
00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:42,412
So, her book on advanced charm casting is a must-read.

267
00:29:42,492 --> 00:29:43,822
Newt is far too kind.

268
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:46,912
Fantastic Beasts is required reading for all my fifth years.

269
00:29:47,622 --> 00:29:49,462
Now, let me make some introductions.

270
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:51,872
So, this is, um, Bunty Broadacre,

271
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:54,002
my indispensable assistant for the past seven years.

272
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:56,632
Eight. Years.

273
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,052
And 164 days.

274
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:01,682
- Hmm. - As you can see, indispensable.

275
00:30:01,762 --> 00:30:02,972
And this is...

276
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:05,012
Yusuf Kama.

277
00:30:05,102 --> 00:30:06,392
Pleasure.

278
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:10,062
And you, obviously, already made Jacob's acquaintance.

279
00:30:11,732 --> 00:30:13,652
Newt.

280
00:30:15,612 --> 00:30:17,532
So... So, this is my brother, Theseus,

281
00:30:17,612 --> 00:30:20,072
and, um, he works for the Ministry.

282
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,282
Actually, head of the British Auror Office.

283
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,832
Ah! Well, I'll have to ensure my wand registration's up-to-date.

284
00:30:26,412 --> 00:30:27,412
Yes.

285
00:30:28,122 --> 00:30:30,542
Although, strictly speaking, that doesn't fall within my purview.

286
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:42,302
Oh.

287
00:30:50,312 --> 00:30:51,432
All right then.

288
00:30:51,522 --> 00:30:54,942
Well, I imagine that you're all wondering why you find yourselves here.

289
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,692
And in anticipation of that,

290
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,282
Dumbledore asked that I convey a message.

291
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:05,572
So, Grindelwald has the ability to see snatches of the future.

292
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:07,282
So, we have to assume

293
00:31:07,372 --> 00:31:10,952
that he'll be able to anticipate what we do before we do it.

294
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:15,172
So, if we hope to defeat him and to save our world,

295
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:17,962
to save your world, Jacob,

296
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,632
then our best hope is to confuse him.

297
00:31:22,222 --> 00:31:23,222
Uh...

298
00:31:24,512 --> 00:31:25,382
'Scuse me.

299
00:31:25,472 --> 00:31:28,972
I'm sorry. How do you confuse a guy that can see the future?

300
00:31:29,062 --> 00:31:30,772
Countersight.

301
00:31:31,312 --> 00:31:32,482
Exactly.

302
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,392
The best plan being no plan.

303
00:31:35,482 --> 00:31:37,152
Or, many overlapping plans.

304
00:31:37,232 --> 00:31:38,442
Thus, confusion.

305
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,482
It's working on me right now.

306
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:44,322
In fact, Dumbledore asked that I give you something, Jacob.

307
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:55,162
It's snake wood.

308
00:31:55,252 --> 00:31:56,922
It's, uh, somewhat rare.

309
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:59,002
Are you kiddin' me right now?

310
00:31:59,092 --> 00:32:00,172
Is this thing real?

311
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:01,552
Yes.

312
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:04,762
Well, it doesn't have a core, so sort of, but yes.

313
00:32:05,302 --> 00:32:06,722
It's sorta real?

314
00:32:09,852 --> 00:32:12,772
More importantly, where we're going, you'll need it.

315
00:32:13,852 --> 00:32:17,442
Now, there's something for you too, I think, Theseus. Um...

316
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,862
Teddy, please let go now.

317
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:22,232
Teddy, please let go.

318
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:25,652
No. Teddy, will you behave?

319
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:27,362
This is Theseus's...

320
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:34,621
Um, that's...

321
00:32:34,701 --> 00:32:36,291
Well, of course.

322
00:32:37,711 --> 00:32:39,461
Now everything makes sense.

323
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,211
Um, Lally, I believe you were given some reading material?

324
00:32:42,301 --> 00:32:43,381
You know what they say.

325
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,171
A book can take you around the world and back,

326
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:47,131
all you have to do is open it.

327
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:48,301
She ain't kiddin'.

328
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:50,801
Yes, uh, Bunty, um...

329
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,931
that's for you.

330
00:32:53,011 --> 00:32:55,021
I was told it was for your eyes only.

331
00:32:55,981 --> 00:32:56,981
Oh.

332
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,401
Oh.

333
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,911
And, Kama.

334
00:33:09,991 --> 00:33:12,031
I have what I need.

335
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:16,961
What about Tina? Uh, is Tina coming?

336
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:18,621
Tina's not available.

337
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:19,871
Um...

338
00:33:19,961 --> 00:33:23,341
Tina's been promoted, she's very, very busy from...

339
00:33:24,091 --> 00:33:25,511
well, from what I understand.

340
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:29,261
Tina's been made head of the American Auror Office.

341
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,761
- Oh. - We know each other well.

342
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:33,601
She's quite a remarkable woman.

343
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,271
She is.

344
00:33:35,811 --> 00:33:37,231
So, this is the team that's gonna take down

345
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:39,901
the most dangerous wizard we've faced in over a century.

346
00:33:40,691 --> 00:33:42,941
A magizoologist, his indispensable assistant,

347
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,271
a schoolteacher,

348
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:47,401
a wizard descended from a very old French family, and...

349
00:33:48,571 --> 00:33:52,241
...a Muggle baker with his fake wand.

350
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,121
Hey, we got you too, pal,

351
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,701
and his wand works.

352
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:01,541
Who wouldn't like our chances?

353
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,211
Oh. Uh...

354
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:30,201
You're all right, little one.

355
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,411
Berlin.

356
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:40,831
Wonderful.

357
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,261
Kama...

358
00:34:48,841 --> 00:34:50,511
stay safe.

359
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:05,021
I must be going too now, Newt.

360
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,031
No one can know everything...

361
00:35:09,491 --> 00:35:11,031
not even you.

362
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,690
Right.

363
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,610
Well, here it is.

364
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,880
Huh.

365
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,430
German Ministry of Magic?

366
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,680
Yes.

367
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,560
I take it we're here for a reason.

368
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,140
Yes, we have a tea ceremony to attend,

369
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:28,520
and if we don't hurry up, we'll be late.

370
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,650
Jacob, stay with the group.

371
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,580
Santos! Santos! Santos!

372
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,920
Santos! Santos! Santos!

373
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,310
Evening...

374
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,890
Helmut.

375
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,600
Theseus.

376
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,810
Hey, hey.

377
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,570
They're with me.

378
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,960
Santos! Santos! Santos!

379
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,050
Incendio.

380
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,910
I take it we're not here for the finger sandwiches.

381
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:05,830
Uh, no, I have a message to deliver.

382
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,210
A message?

383
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,500
To who?

384
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,960
Mr. Vogel, it's a pleasure to be here.

385
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,460
It's an honor to meet you.

386
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,170
You are joking.

387
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,430
No.

388
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,050
What am I even doing here? Let's go outside.

389
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,890
I'm not very good in these situations.

390
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,140
These situations?

391
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,060
With all the people,

392
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,480
the fancy people.

393
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,019
Hello.

394
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:34,729
I saw you enter the room

395
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:36,529
and I thought to myself,

396
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:39,859
Edith, that's an interesting-looking man.

397
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:41,949
Jacob Kowalski.

398
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:44,199
How are you? Very nice to meet you.

399
00:38:44,279 --> 00:38:47,159
And where is it you hail from, Mr. Kowalski?

400
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:49,459
Queens.

401
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:50,919
Ah!

402
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:55,959
Sorry, Herr Vogel. Sorry, I wonder if I could have a word?

403
00:38:57,129 --> 00:38:58,339
Oh!

404
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,379
Merlin's beard, it's Mr. Scamander, isn't it?

405
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:03,219
Herr Vogel...

406
00:39:06,139 --> 00:39:11,229
I have a message from a friend, and it cannot wait.

407
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,109
Do what is right...

408
00:39:17,899 --> 00:39:19,489
not what is easy.

409
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:24,159
He said it was important that I reach you tonight,

410
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,539
that you hear them tonight, the words.

411
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,539
It's time, sir.

412
00:39:36,089 --> 00:39:37,549
Is he here?

413
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:39,419
In Berlin?

414
00:39:41,169 --> 00:39:43,299
No, of course not.

415
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:46,809
Why leave Hogwarts when the world outside is burning?

416
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,979
I thank you, Mr. Scamander.

417
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:31,679
Thank you.

418
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:34,139
Thank you.

419
00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:40,359
I see many familiar faces here tonight.

420
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:43,149
Colleagues, friends...

421
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:45,529
foes.

422
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:49,989
Within the next 48 hours,

423
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,709
you, along with the rest of the Wizarding World,

424
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:56,209
will choose our next great leader.

425
00:40:56,289 --> 00:41:01,209
A choice that will shape our lives for generations to come.

426
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:06,589
I have little doubt that, no matter who should triumph,

427
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:10,219
the Confederation will be in able hands.

428
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:11,929
Liu Tao.

429
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,689
Vicência Santos.

430
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:25,569
Thank you, thank you.

431
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:31,288
It's in moments such as these we are reminded

432
00:41:31,368 --> 00:41:34,538
that it is this peaceful transfer of power

433
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:36,618
which marks our humanity

434
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:40,748
and demonstrates to the world that, despite our differences,

435
00:41:41,588 --> 00:41:44,048
all voices deserve to be heard...

436
00:41:46,178 --> 00:41:50,098
even voices which many may find disagreeable.

437
00:41:51,558 --> 00:41:52,968
Newt.

438
00:41:53,058 --> 00:41:55,268
Any of those lot look familiar to you?

439
00:41:59,108 --> 00:42:02,068
Paris. The night that Leta...

440
00:42:03,028 --> 00:42:05,358
They were with Grindelwald.

441
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:08,658
Mm.

442
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:22,588
And so, after an extensive investigation,

443
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:28,718
the Confederation has concluded that insufficient evidence exists...

444
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:32,598
to prosecute Gellert Grindelwald

445
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,268
for the crimes against the Muggle community

446
00:42:35,348 --> 00:42:37,768
of which he was accused.

447
00:42:38,728 --> 00:42:45,028
He is hereby absolved of all his alleged crimes.

448
00:42:47,818 --> 00:42:49,238
Are you kidding me?

449
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,238
They're letting the guy off?

450
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,948
I was there, he was killing people.

451
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:55,248
You're under arrest.

452
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:57,828
All of you.

453
00:42:58,248 --> 00:42:59,248
Wands down!

454
00:43:07,758 --> 00:43:08,838
Theseus.

455
00:43:10,258 --> 00:43:11,428
Theseus!

456
00:43:12,138 --> 00:43:14,808
Newt, Newt. Not here.

457
00:43:15,308 --> 00:43:17,478
Newt, we don't stand a chance.

458
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:19,978
Let's go. Newt,

459
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:22,608
they have the German Ministry. We've got to go.

460
00:43:22,688 --> 00:43:23,648
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

461
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:26,148
It ain't right. That's not justice.

462
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,028
"Extended investigation." I was there.

463
00:43:28,528 --> 00:43:30,988
Were you there? Were you there? I was there.

464
00:43:31,068 --> 00:43:32,658
- You just let a killer off! - Jacob.

465
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:34,028
Whoa!

466
00:43:34,238 --> 00:43:35,948
We have to go. We have to go.

467
00:43:36,038 --> 00:43:37,908
Jacob, let's go.

468
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:11,948
That's very good.

469
00:44:14,828 --> 00:44:16,698
Her favorite.

470
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:21,828
Remember how she begged Mother to make it?

471
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:26,338
Ariana.

472
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:31,927
Mother claimed it calmed her, but I think that was wishful thinking.

473
00:44:32,007 --> 00:44:33,087
Albus.

474
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:35,887
I was there.

475
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:38,137
I grew up in the same house.

476
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:41,557
Everything you saw, I saw.

477
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:48,227
Everything.

478
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,957
Read the sign, you stupid sod.

479
00:45:11,217 --> 00:45:12,967
I'm sorry to disturb you, Albus.

480
00:45:13,047 --> 00:45:14,507
Tell me, what is it?

481
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,217
It's Berlin.

482
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:18,467
What happened?

483
00:45:18,557 --> 00:45:22,767
Vogel has absolved Gellert of all his crimes.

484
00:45:22,847 --> 00:45:25,597
He's free. He says there's no proof.

485
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:30,937
He tried to arrest aurors who were there the night Leta Lestrange was murdered.

486
00:45:42,827 --> 00:45:44,537
Rather disappointing.

487
00:45:46,127 --> 00:45:48,207
I'm going to need someone to cover my morning classes.

488
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,997
Can I impose on you?

489
00:45:50,087 --> 00:45:52,757
Of course. And, Albus, please be...

490
00:45:52,837 --> 00:45:54,717
I'll do my best.

491
00:45:57,007 --> 00:45:58,847
Evening, Aberforth.

492
00:45:58,927 --> 00:46:00,177
Evening, Minerva.

493
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:02,637
Apologies for calling you a stupid sod.

494
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:05,387
Apology accepted.

495
00:46:09,357 --> 00:46:11,857
I'm afraid I'll have to cut our evening short.

496
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:13,897
Off to save the world, are we?

497
00:46:13,987 --> 00:46:16,067
That will take a better man than me.

498
00:46:20,907 --> 00:46:22,537
Don't ask.

499
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,367
There are thousands in the streets chanting your name.

500
00:47:03,447 --> 00:47:05,287
You're a free man.

501
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,917
Tell the others to prepare to leave.

502
00:47:13,957 --> 00:47:15,457
- Tonight? - Tomorrow.

503
00:47:16,337 --> 00:47:18,427
We'll have a visitor in the morning.

504
00:47:23,597 --> 00:47:25,517
Why does it stay with him?

505
00:47:26,637 --> 00:47:28,807
It must sense what he's about to do.

506
00:47:30,646 --> 00:47:32,146
And you're sure...

507
00:47:33,436 --> 00:47:35,856
that he can kill Dumbledore?

508
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,656
His pain is his power.

509
00:47:46,786 --> 00:47:49,706
The man that I am inquiring about is the head of the British Auror Office.

510
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:53,036
How can you have misplaced the head of the British Auror Office?

511
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,626
As our contention said, since he was never in our custody,

512
00:47:59,716 --> 00:48:01,086
we never misplaced him.

513
00:48:01,176 --> 00:48:04,096
Sir, there were dozens of people there, any one of them could corroborate...

514
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:06,136
- And your name is? - Let's get out of here.

515
00:48:07,056 --> 00:48:08,936
Wait a minute, that's the guy.

516
00:48:09,516 --> 00:48:11,096
Come here. Come here.

517
00:48:11,186 --> 00:48:12,266
Excuse me!

518
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,436
Hey!

519
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:17,816
That's the guy. He knows where Theseus is.

520
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:18,816
Hello!

521
00:48:20,236 --> 00:48:21,816
Where's Theseus?

522
00:48:21,946 --> 00:48:24,866
That's him. He knows about Theseus.

523
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:47,306
Newt.

524
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:50,556
Ah.

525
00:49:01,196 --> 00:49:03,236
Albus.

526
00:49:07,116 --> 00:49:09,996
Theseus has been taken to the Erkstag.

527
00:49:10,076 --> 00:49:12,536
Wait, no, but the Erkstag shut down years ago.

528
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:17,296
Yes, well, it's the Ministry's secret little bed and breakfast now.

529
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:19,966
You'll need this to see him.

530
00:49:21,296 --> 00:49:22,506
And one of these.

531
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:26,466
- Mm-hmm. - And this.

532
00:49:28,306 --> 00:49:31,766
Wait, wait, wait.

533
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:36,566
I trust you're enjoying your wand, Mr. Kowalski?

534
00:49:36,646 --> 00:49:39,726
Me? Oh, uh... Yeah, thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

535
00:49:39,816 --> 00:49:41,186
It's a real pip.

536
00:49:41,276 --> 00:49:42,526
I advise you to keep it close.

537
00:49:42,606 --> 00:49:44,356
- Professor Hicks. - Dumbledore.

538
00:49:44,446 --> 00:49:47,866
Assuming you're not otherwise engaged, and frankly even if you are,

539
00:49:47,946 --> 00:49:50,616
I encourage you to attend tonight's candidates' dinner.

540
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,246
Take Mr. Kowalski.

541
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:54,456
I'm quite certain there'll be an assassination attempt.

542
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:57,836
Anything you can do to scotch that will be greatly appreciated.

543
00:49:57,916 --> 00:49:58,876
It's my pleasure.

544
00:49:58,956 --> 00:50:00,376
I shall welcome the challenge.

545
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,916
Besides, I'll have Jacob with me.

546
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:04,676
Oh, not to worry.

547
00:50:04,756 --> 00:50:08,056
Professor Hicks's defensive magic is superb.

548
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:10,176
Until next time.

549
00:50:10,266 --> 00:50:11,806
Such a flatterer.

550
00:50:11,886 --> 00:50:14,686
Well, not really. It is superb.

551
00:50:15,476 --> 00:50:16,726
Albus!

552
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:18,646
I was just wondering...

553
00:50:18,726 --> 00:50:19,936
Ah.

554
00:50:21,186 --> 00:50:22,186
Yes.

555
00:50:23,856 --> 00:50:25,276
- The case. - Yes.

556
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:28,196
Rest assured, it's in safe hands.

557
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:43,165
Can I help you?

558
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:45,335
Yes.

559
00:50:45,425 --> 00:50:48,295
I'd like to have this case replicated, please.

560
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:49,925
Certainly.

561
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,725
Oh. No, you mustn't open it.

562
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:58,855
Um, I mean, it's not necessary.

563
00:50:59,565 --> 00:51:01,565
The interior isn't important.

564
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:05,985
I see no reason I can't make you one.

565
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:20,335
If you leave it here.

566
00:51:20,415 --> 00:51:21,795
Oh. No...

567
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:24,375
I couldn't leave it.

568
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,925
And I'll be needing more than one.

569
00:51:28,755 --> 00:51:30,425
You see, um...

570
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:35,015
...my husband, he's a bit absentminded.

571
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:37,015
He's always forgetting things.

572
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:39,095
Just the other day, he forgot he was married to me.

573
00:51:41,605 --> 00:51:44,025
Can you imagine?

574
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:49,775
But I love him.

575
00:51:50,945 --> 00:51:53,365
Exactly how many were you thinking?

576
00:51:53,445 --> 00:51:54,865
Um...

577
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,365
Half a dozen,

578
00:51:56,455 --> 00:51:59,125
and I'll need them in two days' time.

579
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,425
Show your hands.

580
00:52:14,805 --> 00:52:16,015
Who are you?

581
00:52:16,885 --> 00:52:18,685
My name is Yusuf Kama.

582
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,855
Who's our visitor?

583
00:52:21,935 --> 00:52:23,265
I'm an admirer.

584
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:26,065
You murdered his sister.

585
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,815
Her name was Leta.

586
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:32,195
Leta Lestrange.

587
00:52:32,735 --> 00:52:34,445
Ah, yes.

588
00:52:34,535 --> 00:52:36,695
You and your sister share an ancient bloodline.

589
00:52:36,785 --> 00:52:38,205
Shared.

590
00:52:38,285 --> 00:52:40,165
That's the only thing we shared.

591
00:52:41,415 --> 00:52:44,665
Dumbledore sent you, am I right?

592
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:47,795
He fears you're in possession of a creature.

593
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:50,755
He fears the use you may put it to.

594
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:53,925
He sent me here to spy on you.

595
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:58,055
What would you like me to tell him?

596
00:53:00,805 --> 00:53:01,975
Queenie.

597
00:53:03,355 --> 00:53:05,435
Is he telling the truth?

598
00:53:18,245 --> 00:53:19,535
What else?

599
00:53:19,615 --> 00:53:21,455
Even though he believes in you,

600
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:24,335
he holds you responsible for his sister's death.

601
00:53:26,045 --> 00:53:28,335
He carries her absence with him every day.

602
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:33,334
Every breath he takes is a reminder that she breathes no more.

603
00:53:35,134 --> 00:53:36,554
Then I presume you won't mind

604
00:53:36,634 --> 00:53:38,634
if I relieve you of your sister's memory.

605
00:53:44,104 --> 00:53:45,264
Right?

606
00:53:46,394 --> 00:53:47,604
Right.

607
00:54:09,504 --> 00:54:10,624
There.

608
00:54:12,174 --> 00:54:13,754
Better?

609
00:54:15,004 --> 00:54:16,504
I thought so.

610
00:54:16,594 --> 00:54:21,014
When we allow ourselves to be consumed by anger, the only victim is our self.

611
00:54:23,514 --> 00:54:26,224
Now, we were just about to depart.

612
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,104
Perhaps you'd like to join us?

613
00:54:28,774 --> 00:54:33,104
Come, we can talk some more about our mutual friend, Dumbledore.

614
00:54:41,864 --> 00:54:43,244
After you.

615
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,704
Hello, Credence.

616
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:23,964
Do you know what it's like to have no one?

617
00:56:24,054 --> 00:56:26,224
To always be alone?

618
00:56:27,514 --> 00:56:28,764
It's you.

619
00:56:31,723 --> 00:56:34,683
You're the one sending messages in the mirror.

620
00:56:35,943 --> 00:56:37,653
I'm a Dumbledore.

621
00:56:38,313 --> 00:56:40,273
You abandoned me.

622
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:45,783
The same blood that runs my veins runs yours.

623
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,623
He's not here for you.

624
00:56:57,713 --> 00:56:59,253
He's here for me.

625
00:57:45,423 --> 00:57:48,883
Things are not quite what they appear, Credence...

626
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:52,013
no matter what you've been told.

627
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:55,683
My name is Aurelius.

628
00:57:56,103 --> 00:57:57,563
He's lied to you.

629
00:57:57,643 --> 00:57:59,023
Kindled your hate.

630
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:02,293
What he's told you isn't true...

631
00:59:04,133 --> 00:59:06,673
but we do share the same blood.

632
00:59:07,963 --> 00:59:10,633
You are a Dumbledore.

633
00:59:23,943 --> 00:59:26,023
I'm sorry for your pain.

634
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:29,362
We didn't know, I promise.

635
01:00:04,312 --> 01:00:07,062
NO ENTRANCE! ACCESS PROHIBITED!

636
01:00:23,832 --> 01:00:25,582
I've come to see my brother.

637
01:00:25,672 --> 01:00:27,582
His name is Theseus Scamander.

638
01:00:36,392 --> 01:00:37,842
Sorry, that's, uh...

639
01:00:39,892 --> 01:00:41,312
Wand.

640
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:57,612
Oh, that's, uh...

641
01:00:57,702 --> 01:00:59,992
I'm... I'm a magizoologist.

642
01:01:00,992 --> 01:01:02,202
He's perfectly harmless. He's...

643
01:01:02,952 --> 01:01:04,712
He's just a pet, really.

644
01:01:06,672 --> 01:01:08,332
Sorry.

645
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:12,462
That's Teddy.

646
01:01:12,552 --> 01:01:14,342
He's a total nightmare, truth be told.

647
01:01:14,422 --> 01:01:15,922
They stay here.

648
01:01:37,702 --> 01:01:39,912
So, how will I know where to find him?

649
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:41,912
He's your brother?

650
01:01:42,992 --> 01:01:44,202
Yes.

651
01:01:44,292 --> 01:01:46,912
He will be the one who looks like your brother.

652
01:01:51,342 --> 01:01:53,002
I will be back, Pick.

653
01:01:53,422 --> 01:01:54,712
On my word.

654
01:02:01,102 --> 01:02:02,722
"I'll be back, Pick.

655
01:02:02,812 --> 01:02:05,022
"On my word."

656
01:02:05,602 --> 01:02:09,442
And I'll be Minister of Magic one day.

657
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:50,311
Take us 'round the back.

658
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:51,561
It's not safe here.

659
01:02:51,651 --> 01:02:52,651
No.

660
01:02:53,361 --> 01:02:54,271
Roll it down.

661
01:02:54,651 --> 01:02:55,901
What?

662
01:02:56,651 --> 01:02:58,191
The window.

663
01:02:58,281 --> 01:02:59,611
Roll it down.

664
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,921
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

665
01:03:18,091 --> 01:03:19,801
No. No!

666
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:29,681
Those people...

667
01:03:30,231 --> 01:03:32,351
aren't suggesting we listen to them.

668
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:34,441
They aren't asking us to listen.

669
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:36,441
They're demanding it.

670
01:03:37,441 --> 01:03:41,031
You're actually proposing that that man be allowed to stand?

671
01:03:41,111 --> 01:03:42,451
Yes.

672
01:03:43,161 --> 01:03:44,531
Yes, let him stand.

673
01:03:48,581 --> 01:03:50,661
Gellert Grindelwald wants a Muggle-wizard war,

674
01:03:50,751 --> 01:03:53,791
and if he gets his wish, he won't just destroy their world,

675
01:03:53,881 --> 01:03:55,211
he'll destroy ours as well.

676
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:57,171
Which is why he cannot win.

677
01:03:58,711 --> 01:04:00,381
Let him stand as a candidate.

678
01:04:00,471 --> 01:04:02,221
Let the people vote.

679
01:04:02,301 --> 01:04:04,431
When he loses, the people will have spoken.

680
01:04:05,181 --> 01:04:07,851
But deny them their voices,

681
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:10,601
and those streets will run with blood.

682
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,831
Theseus.

683
01:04:40,091 --> 01:04:41,091
Theseus.

684
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:18,810
Lally,

685
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,020
the guy with the hair...

686
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:23,820
sitting next to Edith.

687
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,400
He looks like he can kill somebody.

688
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:30,120
He also looks like my Uncle Dominic.

689
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,830
Is your Uncle Dominic the Norwegian Minister of Magic?

690
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:35,080
No.

691
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,660
Didn't think so.

692
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:07,030
Queenie.

693
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,320
Queenie.

694
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:19,290
Ah.

695
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:22,540
Madam Santos, a pleasure.

696
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:25,800
Your supporters are in fine voice.

697
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,300
As are yours, Mr. Grindelwald.

698
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:50,530
Rescuing me, are you?

699
01:07:50,610 --> 01:07:52,450
- That's the general idea. - Huh.

700
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:55,080
And I presume this...

701
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:58,120
whatever it is that you are doing, is strategic.

702
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,290
Yes, a technique called limbic mimicry.

703
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:03,790
It discourages violent engagement, theoretically.

704
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,460
I've only actually ever attempted it once before.

705
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,880
- And the results? - Uh...

706
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:11,260
Inconclusive.

707
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,090
Course that was a laboratory setting

708
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:15,600
and the conditions were strictly controlled, and the...

709
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,470
Well, the current conditions are more volatile,

710
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,560
so making it less predictive of the ultimate outcome.

711
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,940
The ultimate outcome presumably...

712
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:27,110
being our survival.

713
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:22,579
Well done, come on.

714
01:09:27,959 --> 01:09:29,749
And the plan is?

715
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:31,009
Hold this.

716
01:09:47,019 --> 01:09:48,819
What the bloody hell was that for?

717
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:50,479
Um...

718
01:09:50,569 --> 01:09:52,189
We're gonna need some help.

719
01:10:01,999 --> 01:10:03,329
Follow me.

720
01:10:08,209 --> 01:10:09,379
Come on.

721
01:10:18,929 --> 01:10:20,719
You're not swiveling properly.

722
01:10:21,219 --> 01:10:22,309
Swivel...

723
01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:24,479
swivel, but delicately.

724
01:10:25,229 --> 01:10:27,649
I'm swiveling like you're swiveling, Newt.

725
01:10:27,729 --> 01:10:29,359
I don't believe you are.

726
01:10:48,669 --> 01:10:49,749
Swivel.

727
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:04,349
Go to him.

728
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:13,529
Queenie.

729
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:19,739
Tell him it's all right.

730
01:11:20,569 --> 01:11:22,159
I can see he's failed.

731
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:24,659
He'll have another chance.

732
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:28,788
It's his loyalty I most value.

733
01:12:03,328 --> 01:12:04,618
Stay here.

734
01:12:24,928 --> 01:12:25,928
Oh.

735
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:28,228
Apologies.

736
01:12:33,858 --> 01:12:34,938
Hmm.

737
01:12:35,858 --> 01:12:37,688
Oh, boy.

738
01:12:54,538 --> 01:12:56,248
Let her go.

739
01:12:56,798 --> 01:12:58,048
Excuse me?

740
01:13:06,928 --> 01:13:09,138
- Assassin! - Huh?

741
01:15:10,927 --> 01:15:12,017
Huh?

742
01:17:19,807 --> 01:17:20,727
No, wait.

743
01:17:35,826 --> 01:17:36,656
Newt!

744
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:41,616
Accio!

745
01:17:42,626 --> 01:17:43,786
Grab the tie.

746
01:18:32,756 --> 01:18:34,256
That was a Portkey.

747
01:18:34,926 --> 01:18:35,926
Yeah.

748
01:18:39,136 --> 01:18:40,846
Well done, you two.

749
01:19:05,036 --> 01:19:06,626
Not that either of you asked,

750
01:19:06,706 --> 01:19:08,916
but I would highly recommend learning Charms.

751
01:19:08,996 --> 01:19:09,916
Lally.

752
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:11,416
What kept you two?

753
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:14,426
Uh, we encountered some complications. You?

754
01:19:14,546 --> 01:19:17,466
We encountered some complications.

755
01:19:21,676 --> 01:19:23,476
Jacob tried to murder Grindelwald?

756
01:19:23,556 --> 01:19:25,436
It's a long story.

757
01:19:25,516 --> 01:19:27,266
Is it really snake wood?

758
01:19:27,356 --> 01:19:29,066
Yes, it's really snake wood.

759
01:19:29,566 --> 01:19:31,896
- Can I... - Mm-mm.

760
01:19:32,356 --> 01:19:33,856
Very dangerous.

761
01:19:34,526 --> 01:19:35,526
It's very powerful.

762
01:19:36,106 --> 01:19:38,566
It's rare. If it got in the wrong hands, you know...

763
01:19:38,656 --> 01:19:39,696
mess you up.

764
01:19:39,776 --> 01:19:41,406
Where did you get it?

765
01:19:42,446 --> 01:19:44,116
I got it for Christmas.

766
01:19:44,206 --> 01:19:45,286
Jacob,

767
01:19:45,366 --> 01:19:46,666
look who I found.

768
01:19:46,746 --> 01:19:47,826
Hey.

769
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:50,296
It's my wizard friends, Newt and Theseus.

770
01:19:50,376 --> 01:19:52,756
We're like this, okay, and that's me right there.

771
01:19:52,836 --> 01:19:55,166
I gotta go. All right, have fun.

772
01:19:55,876 --> 01:19:57,466
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

773
01:19:58,216 --> 01:19:59,426
Can you believe this place?

774
01:19:59,506 --> 01:20:00,756
They got pint-sized little witches and wizards

775
01:20:00,846 --> 01:20:01,846
running around here.

776
01:20:01,926 --> 01:20:03,176
You don't say.

777
01:20:03,886 --> 01:20:05,176
I was the assassin.

778
01:20:05,846 --> 01:20:07,686
Newt and Theseus both went to Hogwarts.

779
01:20:07,766 --> 01:20:09,806
Oh, I knew that. Well, they're being very nice to me.

780
01:20:09,896 --> 01:20:11,816
The Slytherin boys over there, they gave me these.

781
01:20:11,896 --> 01:20:13,736
They're delicious. Who wants one?

782
01:20:14,356 --> 01:20:16,646
I never cared for cockroach clusters much myself,

783
01:20:16,736 --> 01:20:19,276
although Honeydukes are supposed to be the best.

784
01:20:24,996 --> 01:20:26,156
Off you go.

785
01:20:26,915 --> 01:20:27,955
McGonagall.

786
01:20:28,665 --> 01:20:29,785
Albus.

787
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:30,875
Well done.

788
01:20:30,955 --> 01:20:32,585
All of you, well done.

789
01:20:32,665 --> 01:20:33,585
Congratulations.

790
01:20:33,665 --> 01:20:35,375
- Congratulations? - Indeed.

791
01:20:35,465 --> 01:20:38,715
Professor Hicks managed to foil an assassination.

792
01:20:39,385 --> 01:20:41,925
And you are alive and you are well.

793
01:20:42,005 --> 01:20:44,885
The fact that everything didn't go precisely to plan

794
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:46,265
was precisely the plan.

795
01:20:46,345 --> 01:20:47,765
Countersight 101.

796
01:20:47,845 --> 01:20:50,305
Albus, forgive me, but aren't we back where we started?

797
01:20:50,395 --> 01:20:53,185
Actually, I would argue that things are...

798
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,435
a great deal worse.

799
01:20:57,565 --> 01:20:58,945
You haven't told them, have you?

800
01:21:00,365 --> 01:21:03,235
Grindelwald's been allowed to stand in the election.

801
01:21:04,235 --> 01:21:05,575
- What? - But how?

802
01:21:06,155 --> 01:21:09,785
Because Vogel chose easy over right.

803
01:21:32,355 --> 01:21:33,355
Hmm.

804
01:21:34,685 --> 01:21:35,525
It's all right.

805
01:21:36,025 --> 01:21:37,235
Bhutan.

806
01:21:37,315 --> 01:21:39,315
Correct. Three points to Hufflepuff.

807
01:21:39,815 --> 01:21:43,775
The kingdom of Bhutan sits high in the Eastern Himalayas.

808
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:47,655
It's a place of indescribable beauty.

809
01:21:47,745 --> 01:21:51,245
Some of our most important magic has its origins there.

810
01:21:51,325 --> 01:21:56,295
They say if you listen carefully enough, the past whispers to you.

811
01:21:57,585 --> 01:22:00,125
It also happens to be where the election will be held.

812
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:01,545
He can't win, can he?

813
01:22:01,635 --> 01:22:04,005
Only a few days ago he was a fugitive from justice.

814
01:22:04,095 --> 01:22:09,555
Now he is an official candidate in the International Confederation of Wizards.

815
01:22:11,435 --> 01:22:14,435
Dangerous times favor dangerous men.

816
01:22:16,605 --> 01:22:20,105
By the way, we'll be dining with my brother in the village.

817
01:22:20,195 --> 01:22:23,065
Should you need anything before then, Minerva is here.

818
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:25,905
Dumbledore has a brother?

819
01:22:29,115 --> 01:22:30,205
Huh.

820
01:22:44,215 --> 01:22:45,295
Here we are.

821
01:22:49,765 --> 01:22:51,385
Bunty, you're here.

822
01:22:51,475 --> 01:22:52,555
Yes.

823
01:22:54,305 --> 01:22:55,435
How is she?

824
01:22:55,515 --> 01:22:56,565
Oh, she's fine.

825
01:22:57,605 --> 01:22:58,645
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

826
01:22:58,725 --> 01:23:00,355
What's Alfie done now?

827
01:23:00,435 --> 01:23:02,695
Wait, you've not been biting Timothy's bottom again, have you?

828
01:23:02,775 --> 01:23:07,275
Miss Broadacre, I trust my brother has been a gracious host?

829
01:23:07,865 --> 01:23:09,995
Yes, ever so gracious.

830
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:11,655
I'm delighted to hear.

831
01:23:11,745 --> 01:23:15,285
Uh, so, rooms have been arranged for you in the village

832
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:18,875
and Aberforth here will prepare you a delicious dinner,

833
01:23:18,955 --> 01:23:20,545
his own recipe.

834
01:23:26,714 --> 01:23:29,214
There's more of that if you want it.

835
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:34,934
Thank you.

836
01:23:35,684 --> 01:23:36,764
Thanks.

837
01:23:40,104 --> 01:23:41,394
Astonishing.

838
01:23:41,484 --> 01:23:44,774
Never has something that looks so repellent tasted so delicious.

839
01:23:44,854 --> 01:23:46,944
Who is this little one?

840
01:23:47,024 --> 01:23:48,024
Do you mind?

841
01:23:48,824 --> 01:23:50,654
She's a Qilin, Jacob.

842
01:23:50,744 --> 01:23:52,574
She's incredibly rare.

843
01:23:52,654 --> 01:23:55,164
One of the most beloved creatures in the Wizarding World.

844
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:56,664
Why?

845
01:23:57,164 --> 01:23:59,334
'Cause she can see into your soul.

846
01:23:59,414 --> 01:24:00,624
Oh. Oh!

847
01:24:02,624 --> 01:24:04,214
You're kidding me.

848
01:24:04,294 --> 01:24:10,214
No. So, if you are good and worthy, then she'll see that.

849
01:24:10,304 --> 01:24:14,054
But if, on the other hand, you're cruel and deceitful,

850
01:24:14,134 --> 01:24:16,014
then she'll know that too.

851
01:24:16,764 --> 01:24:18,264
Oh, yeah?

852
01:24:18,354 --> 01:24:20,934
Does she just tell you that or...

853
01:24:21,894 --> 01:24:23,144
Not exactly tells.

854
01:24:23,234 --> 01:24:28,064
Well, she bows, but only in the presence of someone truly pure of heart.

855
01:24:30,194 --> 01:24:31,824
I mean, almost none of us are, of course,

856
01:24:31,904 --> 01:24:34,404
no matter how good of a person one tries to be.

857
01:24:35,574 --> 01:24:38,624
There was actually a time, many, many years ago,

858
01:24:38,704 --> 01:24:41,124
when the Qilin chose who'd lead us.

859
01:24:43,084 --> 01:24:44,334
No...

860
01:24:44,414 --> 01:24:47,504
Whoa. Woop. Whoa...

861
01:24:49,004 --> 01:24:51,384
Okay. All right, already.

862
01:24:54,344 --> 01:24:55,174
Here you go.

863
01:24:56,434 --> 01:24:57,434
Thriving.

864
01:24:57,514 --> 01:24:59,054
He's just hungry. Look at him.

865
01:24:59,144 --> 01:25:00,974
- She really likes you, Jacob. - Oh, all right.

866
01:25:04,434 --> 01:25:05,444
It's okay.

867
01:25:14,994 --> 01:25:16,364
Come with me.

868
01:25:18,034 --> 01:25:19,494
I'll help you.

869
01:25:21,334 --> 01:25:23,374
He's your son, Aberforth.

870
01:25:26,214 --> 01:25:27,754
He needs you.

871
01:25:40,974 --> 01:25:42,104
Newt.

872
01:25:54,824 --> 01:25:55,944
Come in.

873
01:25:56,614 --> 01:26:00,374
Albus, the mirror downstairs, there's a message.

874
01:26:00,454 --> 01:26:01,454
Close the door.

875
01:26:09,294 --> 01:26:11,294
It's from Credence, Newt.

876
01:26:14,504 --> 01:26:17,344
The summer Gellert and I fell in love...

877
01:26:18,134 --> 01:26:20,014
my brother fell in love as well,

878
01:26:20,094 --> 01:26:22,394
with a girl from the Hollow.

879
01:26:23,604 --> 01:26:25,184
She was sent away.

880
01:26:26,983 --> 01:26:29,353
There were rumors about a child.

881
01:26:31,273 --> 01:26:32,153
Credence...

882
01:26:32,233 --> 01:26:33,733
He's a Dumbledore.

883
01:26:36,993 --> 01:26:39,153
If I'd been a better friend...

884
01:26:40,203 --> 01:26:42,323
to Aberforth, if I'd been a better brother...

885
01:26:43,873 --> 01:26:45,873
he might have confided in me.

886
01:26:47,453 --> 01:26:49,123
Perhaps things would have been different,

887
01:26:49,213 --> 01:26:50,753
and this boy...

888
01:26:51,463 --> 01:26:54,343
could have been part of our lives, part of our family.

889
01:27:00,013 --> 01:27:03,303
Credence can't be saved, I know you know that.

890
01:27:04,473 --> 01:27:07,973
But he may yet be able to save us.

891
01:27:14,403 --> 01:27:15,693
Phoenix ash.

892
01:27:16,733 --> 01:27:20,113
The bird comes to him because he's dying, Newt.

893
01:27:21,203 --> 01:27:22,863
I know the signs.

894
01:27:23,743 --> 01:27:25,083
You see...

895
01:27:26,913 --> 01:27:30,213
my sister was an Obscurial.

896
01:27:31,123 --> 01:27:34,253
And like Credence, she never learned to express her magic.

897
01:27:35,673 --> 01:27:38,553
Over time it grew darker and began to poison her.

898
01:27:40,093 --> 01:27:43,473
Worst of all, none of us were capable of easing her pain.

899
01:27:47,143 --> 01:27:49,393
Can you tell me how it is that...

900
01:27:50,103 --> 01:27:52,023
or how it came to an end for her?

901
01:27:55,273 --> 01:27:58,693
Gellert and I had made plans to go away together.

902
01:28:00,283 --> 01:28:03,493
My brother didn't approve.

903
01:28:03,573 --> 01:28:05,783
One night, he confronted us.

904
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:08,793
Voices were raised, threats made.

905
01:28:08,873 --> 01:28:12,333
Aberforth drew his wand, which was foolish.

906
01:28:15,083 --> 01:28:18,343
I drew my wand, which was even more foolish.

907
01:28:20,843 --> 01:28:22,803
Gellert just laughed.

908
01:28:23,973 --> 01:28:26,603
No one heard Ariana coming down the stairs.

909
01:28:29,723 --> 01:28:32,063
Can't say for certain it was my...

910
01:28:33,643 --> 01:28:34,653
spell.

911
01:28:39,823 --> 01:28:41,533
Doesn't really matter.

912
01:28:42,283 --> 01:28:46,123
One minute she was there, and the next she was gone.

913
01:28:47,203 --> 01:28:48,953
I'm so sorry, Albus.

914
01:28:51,253 --> 01:28:54,713
But if it's of any comfort, perhaps she was saved some pain...

915
01:28:54,793 --> 01:28:56,333
Don't.

916
01:28:56,423 --> 01:28:58,463
Don't disappoint me, Newt.

917
01:28:59,633 --> 01:29:01,343
You of all people.

918
01:29:02,723 --> 01:29:05,013
Your honesty is a gift...

919
01:29:07,183 --> 01:29:09,723
even if at times a painful one.

920
01:29:14,733 --> 01:29:17,943
Our friends downstairs will be tired and wanting to go home.

921
01:29:18,023 --> 01:29:20,233
You should... You should go.

922
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:37,582
Albus, Lally said something earlier

923
01:29:37,672 --> 01:29:40,632
about most of us being ultimately imperfect.

924
01:29:42,132 --> 01:29:46,052
But even if we make mistakes, terrible things...

925
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:50,182
we can try to make things right.

926
01:29:52,772 --> 01:29:54,392
And that's what matters...

927
01:29:58,102 --> 01:29:59,612
trying.

928
01:30:15,582 --> 01:30:16,792
We're with you.

929
01:30:17,502 --> 01:30:18,582
Thank you.

930
01:30:27,182 --> 01:30:29,892
Our time is close, my brothers and sisters.

931
01:30:30,932 --> 01:30:32,812
Days of hiding are over.

932
01:30:35,432 --> 01:30:37,772
The world will hear our voice.

933
01:30:41,112 --> 01:30:42,612
And it will be deafening.

934
01:30:50,822 --> 01:30:53,662
You didn't come here to betray Dumbledore...

935
01:30:54,912 --> 01:30:57,582
You know in your pure-blood heart...

936
01:30:59,252 --> 01:31:01,172
your place is here.

937
01:31:03,382 --> 01:31:06,132
To believe in me is to believe in yourself.

938
01:31:18,562 --> 01:31:20,852
Prove your loyalty, Mr. Kama.

939
01:31:43,632 --> 01:31:45,502
...Vulnera Sanentur.

940
01:31:46,132 --> 01:31:50,382
Rennervate Vulnera Sanentur.

941
01:31:51,342 --> 01:31:56,182
Rennervate Vulnera Sanentur.

942
01:31:58,602 --> 01:32:04,112
Rennervate Vulnera Sanentur.

943
01:32:08,992 --> 01:32:09,902
There.

944
01:32:11,572 --> 01:32:12,952
There, there.

945
01:32:14,992 --> 01:32:16,242
There.

946
01:32:18,202 --> 01:32:19,832
Come, look.

947
01:32:23,582 --> 01:32:24,792
Hmm.

948
01:32:25,711 --> 01:32:27,801
This is why we are special.

949
01:32:30,881 --> 01:32:34,681
To conceal our powers is not merely an affront to ourselves...

950
01:32:36,311 --> 01:32:37,641
it's sinful.

951
01:32:52,281 --> 01:32:53,861
Was there another?

952
01:32:55,121 --> 01:32:56,331
Another?

953
01:32:57,621 --> 01:33:00,621
That night, was there another Qilin?

954
01:33:04,331 --> 01:33:05,421
I don't think so...

955
01:33:07,341 --> 01:33:08,801
That's twice you failed me.

956
01:33:08,881 --> 01:33:12,801
Do you not understand the danger you put me in?

957
01:33:16,641 --> 01:33:18,351
One last chance.

958
01:33:19,011 --> 01:33:20,181
Understood?

959
01:33:23,391 --> 01:33:24,481
Find it.

960
01:34:19,161 --> 01:34:20,581
Hey, Newt.

961
01:34:21,451 --> 01:34:23,041
What is this place?

962
01:34:24,041 --> 01:34:26,041
The room we require.

963
01:34:30,461 --> 01:34:34,011
I trust you all have the tickets that Bunty gave you?

964
01:34:34,091 --> 01:34:36,591
You'll need them to gain access to the ceremony.

965
01:34:36,681 --> 01:34:37,761
What do you think, Newt?

966
01:34:37,841 --> 01:34:39,511
Can you tell which one is yours?

967
01:34:39,601 --> 01:34:40,511
No.

968
01:34:41,351 --> 01:34:43,221
Good. I'd be worried if you could.

969
01:34:43,311 --> 01:34:45,561
I assume the Qilin's in one of these cases.

970
01:34:45,641 --> 01:34:46,731
Yes.

971
01:34:46,811 --> 01:34:48,691
- Well, which one is it? - Which one indeed.

972
01:34:49,151 --> 01:34:51,401
Ooh, it's like a three-card monte thing.

973
01:34:51,481 --> 01:34:53,321
Like a shell game thing.

974
01:34:53,401 --> 01:34:54,531
Like a short con.

975
01:34:56,571 --> 01:34:58,491
Never mind, it's a Muggle thing.

976
01:34:58,571 --> 01:35:00,951
Grindelwald will do anything within his powers

977
01:35:01,031 --> 01:35:03,371
to get his hands on our rare friend.

978
01:35:03,451 --> 01:35:05,661
Therefore, it's essential that we keep

979
01:35:05,751 --> 01:35:08,921
whoever he dispatches on his behalf guessing...

980
01:35:09,501 --> 01:35:12,091
so the Qilin gets to the ceremony safely.

981
01:35:12,751 --> 01:35:18,011
If, by teatime, the Qilin, not to mention all of us,

982
01:35:18,931 --> 01:35:20,761
are still alive,

983
01:35:20,851 --> 01:35:23,721
we should consider our efforts a success.

984
01:35:23,811 --> 01:35:27,140
For the record, nobody ever died playing three-card monte.

985
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,560
An important distinction.

986
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:34,530
All right, everybody choose a case and we'll be on our way.

987
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:38,280
Mr. Kowalski, you and I will proceed together first.

988
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,160
Me?

989
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:45,870
Okay.

990
01:36:10,810 --> 01:36:12,810
I'm looking forward to you educating me a little further

991
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:15,610
on the finer points of three-card monte.

992
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:18,740
Mm.

993
01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:22,490
My pleasure.

994
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:29,960
Well, good luck, everybody.

995
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:33,670
Good luck.

996
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:37,630
And you too, Bunty girl.

997
01:36:40,510 --> 01:36:41,930
See you, Bunty.

998
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:57,780
It is not lost

999
01:36:57,860 --> 01:37:02,280
on those of us in leadership that we are currently a world divided.

1000
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:05,990
Each day brings talk of another conspiracy.

1001
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:08,790
Each hour another dark whisper.

1002
01:37:09,330 --> 01:37:12,750
These whispers have only increased in recent days

1003
01:37:13,290 --> 01:37:15,670
with the addition of a third candidate.

1004
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:20,880
There is only one way to leave absolutely no doubt

1005
01:37:21,930 --> 01:37:27,180
that a worthy candidate exists amongst the three you have been presented.

1006
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:49,790
As every schoolboy and girl knows,

1007
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:56,340
the Qilin is the purest of creatures in our wonderful magical world.

1008
01:37:57,090 --> 01:37:58,920
It cannot be deceived.

1009
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:03,090
Let the Qilin unite us.

1010
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:25,359
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1011
01:38:33,579 --> 01:38:35,579
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1012
01:38:37,629 --> 01:38:39,289
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1013
01:38:51,519 --> 01:38:52,519
Come.

1014
01:38:56,229 --> 01:38:57,979
Where to, next?

1015
01:38:58,519 --> 01:39:00,269
Uh, this is where I leave you.

1016
01:39:00,819 --> 01:39:03,149
I'm... I'm sorry, you're what?

1017
01:39:03,239 --> 01:39:04,649
Leaving me?

1018
01:39:04,739 --> 01:39:07,359
I have to meet someone else, Mr. Kowalski.

1019
01:39:07,949 --> 01:39:09,199
Not to worry...

1020
01:39:10,119 --> 01:39:11,619
you'll be perfectly safe.

1021
01:39:15,619 --> 01:39:17,079
You don't have the Qilin.

1022
01:39:18,129 --> 01:39:21,049
Feel free to drop the case at the first hint of trouble.

1023
01:39:21,709 --> 01:39:24,879
One other thing, if you don't mind me saying.

1024
01:39:24,969 --> 01:39:27,469
You should stop doubting yourself.

1025
01:39:27,549 --> 01:39:30,429
You have something most men go their entire lives without.

1026
01:39:30,509 --> 01:39:31,929
Do you know what that is?

1027
01:39:33,559 --> 01:39:35,769
A heart that is full.

1028
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:38,649
Only a truly brave man

1029
01:39:38,729 --> 01:39:43,689
could open himself up so honestly and completely, as you do.

1030
01:40:12,309 --> 01:40:14,019
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1031
01:40:14,099 --> 01:40:20,189
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1032
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:30,088
Cases, please.

1033
01:41:48,898 --> 01:41:49,738
Hey, fellas.

1034
01:41:54,948 --> 01:41:56,158
Woo-hoo-hoo.

1035
01:41:58,288 --> 01:41:59,948
He's angry.

1036
01:42:15,968 --> 01:42:19,058
Wait. Open them, make sure it's in there.

1037
01:42:19,138 --> 01:42:20,138
Idiots.

1038
01:44:05,908 --> 01:44:07,368
How long does he have?

1039
01:44:48,667 --> 01:44:50,667
Here. Hey. Hi.

1040
01:44:50,747 --> 01:44:52,037
You're in danger, all right?

1041
01:44:52,127 --> 01:44:53,707
- You need to leave. - Well...

1042
01:44:54,877 --> 01:44:57,377
I can't... I can't go, okay?

1043
01:44:57,467 --> 01:44:58,837
I can't come home.

1044
01:44:58,927 --> 01:45:00,297
It's too late for me, all right?

1045
01:45:00,387 --> 01:45:02,677
Some mistakes, they're just too big.

1046
01:45:02,757 --> 01:45:04,767
Can you listen to me?

1047
01:45:04,847 --> 01:45:07,057
There's no time. I was followed.

1048
01:45:07,727 --> 01:45:10,767
I gave 'em the slip, but it won't be long before they find me.

1049
01:45:10,857 --> 01:45:12,397
- They're gonna find us. - I don't care.

1050
01:45:13,607 --> 01:45:15,187
All I got is us.

1051
01:45:15,277 --> 01:45:16,737
I make no sense without us.

1052
01:45:16,817 --> 01:45:19,657
Jacob, what? Come on...

1053
01:45:19,737 --> 01:45:21,697
I don't love you anymore. Just get outta here.

1054
01:45:21,777 --> 01:45:24,117
You're the worst liar in the world, Queenie Goldstein.

1055
01:45:25,787 --> 01:45:26,867
You hear that?

1056
01:45:26,947 --> 01:45:28,457
What? No.

1057
01:45:28,537 --> 01:45:30,077
That's a sign.

1058
01:45:30,167 --> 01:45:31,377
Oh, man.

1059
01:45:31,457 --> 01:45:33,377
- Oh, come on. - Come here, come here.

1060
01:45:33,787 --> 01:45:35,127
Close your eyes.

1061
01:45:36,087 --> 01:45:37,917
Please close your eyes.

1062
01:45:39,627 --> 01:45:41,467
You know what Dumbledore said to me?

1063
01:45:42,087 --> 01:45:43,097
No.

1064
01:45:43,717 --> 01:45:46,057
He said that I got a full heart.

1065
01:45:50,187 --> 01:45:51,517
He's wrong.

1066
01:45:52,267 --> 01:45:54,817
I'm always gonna have room in there for you.

1067
01:45:56,187 --> 01:45:57,317
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1068
01:45:57,397 --> 01:45:58,737
You know it.

1069
01:45:59,897 --> 01:46:01,157
Look at me.

1070
01:46:04,077 --> 01:46:05,657
Queenie Goldstein.

1071
01:47:11,807 --> 01:47:13,187
Mr. Scamander.

1072
01:47:13,267 --> 01:47:15,107
We've never been properly introduced.

1073
01:47:15,187 --> 01:47:18,107
Henrietta Fischer...

1074
01:47:18,187 --> 01:47:19,817
Herr Vogel's attaché.

1075
01:47:19,897 --> 01:47:21,987
Ah. Yes, uh,

1076
01:47:22,067 --> 01:47:22,987
hello.

1077
01:47:23,067 --> 01:47:25,116
I can take you up.

1078
01:47:25,946 --> 01:47:28,906
There's a private entrance for members of the High Council.

1079
01:47:29,996 --> 01:47:31,786
If you just follow me.

1080
01:47:31,866 --> 01:47:33,496
I'm sorry, why would you do that?

1081
01:47:34,206 --> 01:47:35,376
Take me up?

1082
01:47:36,076 --> 01:47:38,416
Isn't it obvious?

1083
01:47:38,496 --> 01:47:41,086
No, frankly, it's, uh, not.

1084
01:47:45,676 --> 01:47:47,546
Dumbledore sent me.

1085
01:47:49,676 --> 01:47:53,386
I know what you have in that case, Mr. Scamander.

1086
01:48:15,036 --> 01:48:16,786
He should be here any minute.

1087
01:49:20,606 --> 01:49:22,016
What kept you?

1088
01:49:36,616 --> 01:49:39,166
I thank the candidates for their words.

1089
01:49:39,286 --> 01:49:45,586
Each represents a distinct vision of how we will not shape only our world,

1090
01:49:45,666 --> 01:49:48,176
but the non-magical world as well.

1091
01:49:49,546 --> 01:49:54,676
Which brings us to the most important part of our ceremony...

1092
01:49:54,766 --> 01:49:56,976
the walk of the Qilin.

1093
01:51:26,515 --> 01:51:28,775
The Qilin has seen.

1094
01:51:29,855 --> 01:51:31,195
Seen goodness,

1095
01:51:31,695 --> 01:51:33,735
strength...

1096
01:51:33,815 --> 01:51:38,485
qualities essential to lead and to guide us.

1097
01:51:40,705 --> 01:51:42,325
Who do you see?

1098
01:51:58,965 --> 01:52:02,935
Gellert Grindelwald is the new leader of the magical world...

1099
01:52:03,015 --> 01:52:04,725
by acclamation.

1100
01:52:44,185 --> 01:52:46,895
This is the man who tried to take my life.

1101
01:52:48,055 --> 01:52:52,185
This man, who has no magic...

1102
01:52:53,065 --> 01:52:56,235
who would marry a witch and pollute our blood,

1103
01:52:56,315 --> 01:52:59,525
create a forbidden union that would make us less...

1104
01:53:00,325 --> 01:53:02,365
make us weak, like his kind.

1105
01:53:04,405 --> 01:53:06,115
He's not alone, my friends.

1106
01:53:07,665 --> 01:53:10,705
There are thousands who seek to do the same.

1107
01:53:12,455 --> 01:53:15,835
There can only be one response to such vermin.

1108
01:53:25,384 --> 01:53:26,684
No.

1109
01:53:30,104 --> 01:53:31,524
Crucio.

1110
01:53:31,684 --> 01:53:32,524
No!

1111
01:53:35,314 --> 01:53:36,984
Make him stop!

1112
01:53:37,604 --> 01:53:42,614
Our war with the Muggles begins today.

1113
01:54:00,174 --> 01:54:01,924
Jacob.

1114
01:54:42,004 --> 01:54:43,844
He's lying to you.

1115
01:54:46,514 --> 01:54:48,724
That creature is dead.

1116
01:54:56,024 --> 01:54:58,274
Not now. Wait.

1117
01:55:03,024 --> 01:55:04,154
He did it to trick you.

1118
01:55:04,694 --> 01:55:07,444
He killed it and bewitched it

1119
01:55:07,534 --> 01:55:10,244
so that you might think him worthy to lead.

1120
01:55:12,664 --> 01:55:14,794
But he doesn't want to lead you.

1121
01:55:17,374 --> 01:55:19,374
He just wants you to follow.

1122
01:55:20,124 --> 01:55:21,294
Words.

1123
01:55:22,754 --> 01:55:25,094
Words designed to deceive.

1124
01:55:25,804 --> 01:55:28,014
To make you doubt what you've seen with your own two eyes.

1125
01:55:28,094 --> 01:55:29,634
There were two Qilins born that night.

1126
01:55:29,724 --> 01:55:31,974
A twin. And I know that...

1127
01:55:33,394 --> 01:55:34,514
I know that...

1128
01:55:34,604 --> 01:55:35,724
Because?

1129
01:55:40,064 --> 01:55:42,314
Because you have no proof.

1130
01:55:43,194 --> 01:55:45,274
Because there was no second Qilin.

1131
01:55:46,614 --> 01:55:48,034
Am I not right?

1132
01:55:48,114 --> 01:55:49,244
Its mother had been killed, it...

1133
01:55:49,324 --> 01:55:51,864
Then where is it now, Mr. Scamander?

1134
01:56:17,724 --> 01:56:19,894
No one can know everything, Newt.

1135
01:56:19,984 --> 01:56:21,194
Remember?

1136
01:56:51,593 --> 01:56:52,933
I don't get it.

1137
01:57:05,153 --> 01:57:07,483
She can't hear you, little one.

1138
01:57:08,983 --> 01:57:10,403
Not here...

1139
01:57:12,203 --> 01:57:14,613
but perhaps somewhere she's listening.

1140
01:57:18,163 --> 01:57:20,503
This is the true Qilin.

1141
01:57:21,793 --> 01:57:23,003
Look at it...

1142
01:57:23,543 --> 01:57:25,673
you can see it with your own eyes.

1143
01:57:25,753 --> 01:57:28,173
This is the true...

1144
01:57:32,383 --> 01:57:34,933
This can't be allowed to stand.

1145
01:57:35,013 --> 01:57:36,593
The vote must be taken again.

1146
01:57:37,513 --> 01:57:40,183
Come on, Anton. Do something.

1147
01:58:08,543 --> 01:58:09,713
You...

1148
01:58:10,303 --> 01:58:12,053
No, no, no, please.

1149
01:58:37,453 --> 01:58:39,283
I'm honored.

1150
01:58:40,453 --> 01:58:43,583
But just as two of you were born that night,

1151
01:58:43,663 --> 01:58:46,963
there's another here, equally worthy.

1152
01:58:48,423 --> 01:58:50,253
I'm certain of it.

1153
01:59:05,773 --> 01:59:07,103
Thank you.

1154
02:01:59,732 --> 02:02:01,652
Who will love you now, Dumbledore?

1155
02:02:04,702 --> 02:02:06,162
You're all alone.

1156
02:02:56,751 --> 02:02:58,671
I was never your enemy.

1157
02:03:05,931 --> 02:03:08,721
Then, or now.

1158
02:03:49,591 --> 02:03:51,601
Did you ever think of me?

1159
02:03:54,271 --> 02:03:55,521
Always.

1160
02:04:02,901 --> 02:04:04,281
Come home.

1161
02:04:52,781 --> 02:04:55,201
Here she is.

1162
02:04:56,201 --> 02:04:57,871
Well done, Bunty.

1163
02:05:01,831 --> 02:05:03,091
Come on, little one.

1164
02:05:04,421 --> 02:05:07,091
I'm sorry. I must have given you an awful fright.

1165
02:05:07,171 --> 02:05:08,381
No, I think, um...

1166
02:05:08,471 --> 02:05:12,551
sometimes it takes losing something to realize quite how much it means.

1167
02:05:15,511 --> 02:05:17,601
And sometimes you just...

1168
02:05:21,151 --> 02:05:23,150
Sometimes you just know.

1169
02:05:33,530 --> 02:05:35,490
Right, in you pop.

1170
02:05:37,750 --> 02:05:39,790
Mr. Kowalski.

1171
02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:43,130
I owe you an apology.

1172
02:05:43,290 --> 02:05:47,760
It... It was never my intent for you to suffer the Cruciatus curse.

1173
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:50,010
Yeah...

1174
02:05:50,090 --> 02:05:52,470
well, you know, we got Queenie back, so we're square.

1175
02:05:52,550 --> 02:05:54,600
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1176
02:05:55,550 --> 02:05:57,100
Can I keep this?

1177
02:05:57,180 --> 02:05:58,850
For, like, old times' sake?

1178
02:06:01,390 --> 02:06:05,020
I can't think of anyone more deserving.

1179
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:08,980
Thanks, Professor.

1180
02:06:29,710 --> 02:06:30,800
Remarkable.

1181
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:31,720
But how?

1182
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:33,340
I thought you couldn't move against one another.

1183
02:06:33,430 --> 02:06:34,590
We didn't.

1184
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:38,140
He sought to kill, I sought to protect.

1185
02:06:38,220 --> 02:06:40,060
Our spells met.

1186
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:43,480
Let's call it fate.

1187
02:06:44,850 --> 02:06:48,230
After all, how else will we fulfill our destinies?

1188
02:06:50,110 --> 02:06:51,360
Albus.

1189
02:06:53,150 --> 02:06:54,740
Promise me.

1190
02:06:57,030 --> 02:06:59,080
You'll find him and you'll stop him.

1191
02:07:26,850 --> 02:07:29,820
Albert, don't forget the pierogis.

1192
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:31,230
Yes, Mr. K.

1193
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:32,940
Albert.

1194
02:07:33,030 --> 02:07:35,110
No more than eight minutes on the kolaczkis.

1195
02:07:35,700 --> 02:07:37,240
Yes, Mr. K.

1196
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:38,410
He's a sweet kid.

1197
02:07:38,490 --> 02:07:40,950
He doesn't know the difference between paszteciki and golabki.

1198
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:42,160
- Hey, sweetheart. - What?

1199
02:07:42,250 --> 02:07:43,830
Newt doesn't know what you're talking about.

1200
02:07:43,910 --> 02:07:45,330
I don't know what you're talking about.

1201
02:07:45,420 --> 02:07:48,420
And you are not working today, remember?

1202
02:07:48,500 --> 02:07:49,790
Oh!

1203
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:51,710
Oh, are you all right, honey?

1204
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:53,760
Oh, you're nervous about the speech. Don't be nervous.

1205
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:54,880
Tell him, honey.

1206
02:07:54,970 --> 02:07:56,050
Don't be nervous about the speech.

1207
02:07:56,130 --> 02:07:57,010
I'm not nervous.

1208
02:07:57,090 --> 02:07:59,220
What is the smell? Why is there burning?

1209
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:00,720
Albert?

1210
02:08:02,850 --> 02:08:05,850
Mm. Maybe we're nervous about something else, huh?

1211
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:08,770
I can't imagine what you're talking about.

1212
02:08:09,020 --> 02:08:10,020
Mm-hmm.

1213
02:08:23,289 --> 02:08:25,209
So, the day that I first met Jacob...

1214
02:08:25,289 --> 02:08:26,289
Uh...

1215
02:08:26,539 --> 02:08:27,789
The day that I first met Jacob,

1216
02:08:27,869 --> 02:08:30,169
we were both sitting in the Steen National Bank.

1217
02:08:31,959 --> 02:08:33,209
Never would I...

1218
02:08:47,809 --> 02:08:49,729
The maid of honor, I presume?

1219
02:08:51,769 --> 02:08:54,069
The best man, I gather?

1220
02:08:55,939 --> 02:08:58,239
- You've done something to your hair. - No.

1221
02:08:58,819 --> 02:08:59,819
Oh.

1222
02:09:01,529 --> 02:09:03,789
Well, yes, actually, just...

1223
02:09:03,869 --> 02:09:04,909
Just for tonight.

1224
02:09:04,999 --> 02:09:06,619
- Well, it suits you. - Thank you, Newt.

1225
02:09:11,289 --> 02:09:12,249
Oh.

1226
02:09:12,339 --> 02:09:13,549
- Hello. - Hi.

1227
02:09:13,629 --> 02:09:14,749
Look who's...

1228
02:09:15,209 --> 02:09:16,209
Hi.

1229
02:09:17,379 --> 02:09:19,259
So good to see you.

1230
02:09:19,339 --> 02:09:20,719
- Hi. - How are you?

1231
02:09:20,799 --> 02:09:22,009
You look wonderful, Lally.

1232
02:09:22,099 --> 02:09:24,349
Well, thank you, Newt. I appreciate it.

1233
02:09:24,429 --> 02:09:25,469
Good luck.

1234
02:09:25,559 --> 02:09:26,519
Tina, come on.

1235
02:09:26,599 --> 02:09:28,689
- You must tell me how MACUSA's been. - See you inside.

1236
02:09:34,819 --> 02:09:36,689
What about me? How do I look?

1237
02:09:37,029 --> 02:09:38,529
- You all right? - You look fine.

1238
02:09:38,609 --> 02:09:39,569
You okay?

1239
02:09:39,659 --> 02:09:40,659
Yeah, I'm all right.

1240
02:09:40,739 --> 02:09:42,069
You're not nervous, are you?

1241
02:09:43,449 --> 02:09:46,539
Can't be nervous about a speech after saving the world. Hmm.

1242
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:05,139
It's a historic day.

1243
02:10:06,519 --> 02:10:11,059
Where once was before, there will now be after.

1244
02:10:13,979 --> 02:10:17,819
Funny how historic days seem so ordinary when you're living them.

1245
02:10:18,899 --> 02:10:21,449
Well, perhaps that's what happens when the world gets things right.

1246
02:10:21,529 --> 02:10:24,659
Mm, it's jolly nice to know it happens occasionally.

1247
02:10:28,619 --> 02:10:30,579
I didn't know if I'd see you here.

1248
02:10:31,499 --> 02:10:33,079
I wasn't sure you would, either.

1249
02:10:33,169 --> 02:10:34,419
Hey, Newt.

1250
02:10:34,499 --> 02:10:35,459
Yes.

1251
02:10:35,539 --> 02:10:37,499
Jacob seems to think he's lost the ring.

1252
02:10:37,589 --> 02:10:38,759
Please tell me you've got it.

1253
02:10:38,839 --> 02:10:40,759
No, it's all good. Yep.

1254
02:10:40,839 --> 02:10:42,089
Whew!

1255
02:10:42,179 --> 02:10:43,759
That scared me. Jacob!

1256
02:10:46,599 --> 02:10:47,679
Good man, Pick.

1257
02:10:52,979 --> 02:10:54,439
I should probably, um...

1258
02:10:56,109 --> 02:10:57,359
Thank you, Newt.

1259
02:10:58,939 --> 02:11:00,109
What for?

1260
02:11:00,189 --> 02:11:01,699
Pick your poison.

1261
02:11:03,949 --> 02:11:06,489
I really couldn't have done it without you.

1262
02:11:13,369 --> 02:11:15,789
I'd do it again, by the way.

1263
02:11:17,589 --> 02:11:19,129
Should you ask.

1264
02:11:34,478 --> 02:11:35,478
Okay.

1265
02:11:37,768 --> 02:11:38,768
Hey.

1266
02:11:49,658 --> 02:11:50,538
- Hey! - Hello!

1267
02:11:51,038 --> 02:11:52,498
Bunty!

1268
02:11:53,328 --> 02:11:54,868
Bunty!

1269
02:12:14,728 --> 02:12:17,688
Wow, you're so beautiful.

1270
02:12:23,398 --> 02:12:24,608
Oh.

1271
02:12:25,318 --> 02:12:27,368
I can't believe it.

1272
02:12:48,088 --> 02:12:49,638
This is, um... This is Albert.

1273
02:12:49,718 --> 02:12:51,308
I don't know if you've met Albert, yet?

1274
02:12:51,388 --> 02:12:52,768
Have you met Lally?

1275
02:15:36,967 --> 02:15:38,807
You make a wish

1276
02:15:39,307 --> 02:15:42,727
You cast a spell You hope

1277
02:15:43,477 --> 02:15:46,227
An angel rings a bell

1278
02:15:46,317 --> 02:15:48,727
You find yourself

1279
02:15:49,357 --> 02:15:53,777
Still in love with love

1280
02:15:55,487 --> 02:16:00,787
You pull the petals from the stem

1281
02:16:01,207 --> 02:16:05,537
You pray that you'll be her and him

1282
02:16:05,627 --> 02:16:09,457
You hope for some sweet message

1283
02:16:09,877 --> 02:16:12,877
From above

1284
02:16:14,927 --> 02:16:19,927
How did you come down from heaven?

1285
02:16:21,347 --> 02:16:25,187
I'm glad that you came down from heaven

1286
02:16:26,307 --> 02:16:28,437
Did you tumble down?

1287
02:16:28,767 --> 02:16:33,197
Did you hit the ground real hard?

1288
02:16:34,907 --> 02:16:39,327
How did you get here, my dear?

1289
02:16:40,197 --> 02:16:44,617
It isn't very clear, my dear

1290
02:16:45,247 --> 02:16:51,667
When your hand meets mine It is so divine, my dear

1291
02:16:53,797 --> 02:16:57,967
Love can heal the sting of pain

1292
02:16:59,057 --> 02:17:02,887
Purify just like the rain

1293
02:17:04,137 --> 02:17:06,557
Wash your tears away

1294
02:17:07,647 --> 02:17:10,727
And dry them in the sun

1295
02:17:12,027 --> 02:17:17,447
How did you get here, my dear?

1296
02:17:17,737 --> 02:17:21,826
It isn't very clear, my dear

1297
02:17:22,656 --> 02:17:26,166
But when your lips meet mine

1298
02:17:26,246 --> 02:17:28,666
It is so divine

1299
02:17:28,746 --> 02:17:33,166
And I'm in heaven

1300
02:17:35,466 --> 02:17:38,216
Mm

1301
02:17:38,296 --> 02:17:43,136
Yes, I'm in heaven

1302
02:17:46,226 --> 02:17:51,646
Mm, yes, I'm in heaven
