1
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,359
- Thank you.
- Would you like something else?

2
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,320
No. No, no, not just yet. I'm waiting.

3
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,656
I'm expecting someone.

4
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,496
Would this be
one of your regular haunts?

5
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,082
I don't have any regular haunts.

6
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,887
Let me see it.

7
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,899
Sometimes I imagine
I still feel it around my neck.

8
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,652
I carried it for so many years.

9
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,154
How does it feel around yours?

10
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,116
We can free each other of it.

11
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,791
Love to chatter, don't they,
our muggle friends.

12
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,294
Though one must admit,
they make a good cup of tea.

13
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,173
What you're doing is madness.

14
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,635
It's what we said we'd do.

15
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,846
- I was young. I was...
- Committed.

16
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,390
To me.

17
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,017
To us.

18
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,190
I went along because...

19
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,026
Because?

20
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,278
Because I was in love with you.

21
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,156
Yes.

22
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,494
But that's not why you went along.

23
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,997
It was you who said
we could reshape the world.

24
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,834
That it was our birthright.

25
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,898
Can you smell it? The stench.

26
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,238
Do you really intend
to turn your back on your own kind?

27
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,031
For these animals?

28
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:06,204
With or without you,
I'll burn down their world, Albus.

29
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,125
There's nothing you can do to stop me.

30
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,089
Enjoy your cup of tea.

31
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,374
She's ready.

32
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,625
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,865
Beautiful.

34
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,619
All right, you two.

35
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,663
Now, the tricky bit.

36
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,367
Accio.

37
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,349
I'm so sorry.

38
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,303
Twins.

39
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,390
You had twins.

40
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,746
Leave us.

41
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,583
Show me.

42
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,137
The others, they said it was special.

43
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,682
Ooh, it's beyond special.

44
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:47,976
See?

45
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,353
See its eyes?

46
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,231
Those eyes see everything.

47
00:12:55,858 --> 00:13:00,571
When a qilin is born, a righteous leader
will rise to change our world forever.

48
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:08,121
Her birth brings change,
credence, to everything.

49
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,541
You did well.

50
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,588
Rest.

51
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,552
There.

52
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,513
There.

53
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,737
I don't suppose you'd like to
tell me what this is about, would you?

54
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,764
He just asked that we meet,
and that I be sure to bring you.

55
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,932
Hmm.

56
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,100
Right.

57
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,534
Here to meet my brother, I expect.

58
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,453
No, sir.
We're here to see Albus Dumbledore.

59
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,960
- That would be my brother.
- Oh.

60
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,838
Sorry. I'm, um... brilliant.

61
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,798
I'm newt scamander,
and this is theseus...

62
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,259
Up the stairs. First on the left.

63
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,653
Has newt told you
why you're here?

64
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,567
Was he meant to?

65
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,528
No. As a matter of fact.

66
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,116
There's something that we, uh...

67
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,161
That, uh, Dumbledore
wishes to speak to you about.

68
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,163
It's a proposal.

69
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,126
All right.

70
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,857
You know what this is, of course.

71
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,257
Newt had it in Paris.

72
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,052
I can't say I have
much experience with such things,

73
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,888
but it looks to me to be a blood troth.

74
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,599
That would be correct.

75
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,393
And whose blood is contained within?

76
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,437
Mine.

77
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,564
And Grindelwald's.

78
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,379
I'm assuming that's why
you can't move against him?

79
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,403
Yes.

80
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,823
Nor he against me.

81
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,411
Can I ask, what would possess you
to make such a thing?

82
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,914
Love.

83
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,293
Arrogance. Naiveté. Pick your poison.

84
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,714
We were young,
we were going to transform the world.

85
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:47,965
Mm.

86
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:52,094
This ensured that we would,
even if one of us had a change of heart.

87
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,765
And what would happen
if you were to fight him?

88
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,861
It's really quite beautiful,
you have to admit.

89
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:15,952
Were I to even think about defying it...

90
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,549
It knows, you see.

91
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,763
Albus.

92
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,057
It senses the betrayal in my heart.

93
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,475
Albus.

94
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,105
Albus.

95
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,412
That would be the least of it.

96
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,838
Young man's magic,
but as you can see...

97
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,549
Powerful magic.

98
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,971
It can't be undone.

99
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,439
So this proposal, I take it
the qilin has something to do with it?

100
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,190
He promises he won't tell a soul.

101
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,404
Ifwe're to defeat him,

102
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,740
the qilin's only part of it.

103
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,910
The world as we know it
is coming undone.

104
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,875
Gellert's pulling it apart
with hate, bigotry.

105
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:53,799
Things that seem unimaginable today
will seem inevitable tomorrow...

106
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,968
If we don't stop him.

107
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,306
Should you agree to do what I ask...

108
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,100
You'll have to trust me.

109
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,562
Even when every instinct
tells you not to.

110
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,823
Let's hear it.

111
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:47,561
Does he send you to spy on me?

112
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,358
But he asks.

113
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,610
What ya thinkin', what ya feeling.

114
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,946
And the others?

115
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,031
Does he ask what
they're thinking and feeling?

116
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:02,660
Yes, but it's mostly you.

117
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,037
And do you tell him?

118
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,417
You do.

119
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,295
Who's reading whose mind now?

120
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,346
Tell me what you see.

121
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,892
You're a Dumbledore.

122
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,813
It's an important family.

123
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,607
You know this because he's told you.

124
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,696
He's also told you they abandoned you.

125
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,992
That you were a...
A dirty secret.

126
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,205
Um... he says
Dumbledore abandoned him too,

127
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,207
and he knows how you feel.

128
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,419
And for that reason...

129
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,088
He's asked you to kill him.

130
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,802
I want you to go now, queenie.

131
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,391
I don't tell him.

132
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,061
Not always.

133
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,940
Not everything.

134
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,970
Hey, we're...

135
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,516
Queenie.

136
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,017
Hi, sweetie.

137
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,777
Honey...

138
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,529
Look at your bakery.

139
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,656
It's like a ghost town.

140
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,576
Yeah, well, I missed you.

141
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,411
On, baby.

142
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,080
Why don't you come here?

143
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,457
Come here.

144
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,048
Hey.

145
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,388
Everything's gonna be all right.

146
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,684
Everything's gonna be just fine.

147
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:43,839
Hey, sweetheart,
what brings you downtown?

148
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:48,510
I really hope you didn't spend all day
coming up with that.

149
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,390
Oh, you want scary,
is that what you want?

150
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:58,312
You know what it is,
you just aren't menacing enough.

151
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:02,232
I think I'm plenty menacing.

152
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,194
Am I not menacing?

153
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:09,198
Maybe if you waved your arms around,
you know, like a crazy man,

154
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,742
then you'd appear more menacing.

155
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,625
That's good. A little more.

156
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,254
A little more.

157
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,215
Keep going. Perfect.

158
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,760
Three, two, one.

159
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,684
That's enough. Get outta here.

160
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,686
What's on your mind, baker boy?

161
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:39,937
Ah, jeez.

162
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,689
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

163
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:42,856
Oh, well, we're not.

164
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,358
It's a lady.

165
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,903
I tell you what...

166
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,507
I'll give you the first shot.
Go ahead.

167
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,572
You sure?

168
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,033
Oh, boy.

169
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,419
Last time
I ever help that woman out again.

170
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,545
Lallyl

171
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,423
whoopsie, frank.
Sometimes I forget my own strength.

172
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,842
I'll take it from here.
Thank you!

173
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,843
Welcome.

174
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,178
- Catch you later, lally.
- Bye, Stanley.

175
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,142
I'll be over for a game
of befudler Dudley soon.

176
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,890
All right.

177
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,393
That's my cousin Stanley. He's a wizard.

178
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,147
Please! It's early,
don't make me work for it.

179
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,582
I said I wanted out, and I want out.

180
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,691
Come now, Mr. Kowalski.

181
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,235
Can't believe my therapist said
you wizards don't exist.

182
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,654
What a waste of money!

183
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:33,032
You do know I'm a witch, right?

184
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,825
Yeah.

185
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,410
Look_.

186
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,120
You seem like a really nice witch.

187
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,181
You don't know what
I've been through with you people.

188
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,667
So, could you please get out of my life?

189
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,796
- A little over a year ago...
- Oh, my...

190
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,524
In the hopes of securing
a small business loan,

191
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,609
you walked through the doors
of the steen national bank

192
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,011
located about six blocks from here.

193
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,739
You then made the acquaintance
of newt scamander,

194
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:59,558
the world's foremost and,
albeit only, magizoologist.

195
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,702
You then learned of a world

196
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,478
you had previously
been wholly unaware of.

197
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,147
You met and fell in love
with a witch named queenie Goldstein,

198
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,191
had your brain wiped
by means of obliviation,

199
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,817
only it didn't take.

200
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,487
And as a result, you reunited
with Ms. Goldstein who,

201
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,156
after your refusal to marry her, mm,

202
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,993
decided to join gellert Grindelwald
and his dark army of followers,

203
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,495
who pose the single greatest threat

204
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,247
to both your world and ours
in four centuries.

205
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,874
How did I do?

206
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,375
That was good.

207
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,712
Except for the part about queenie
going over to the dark side.

208
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:33,509
I mean, yeah, she's cuckoo.

209
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,095
But she's got a heart
bigger than this whole crazy island,

210
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,055
and she's so smart, you know?

211
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,949
She can legitimately
read your brain, you know,

212
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,100
she's a whatchamacallit...

213
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,143
- A legilimens.
- Yeah.

214
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,065
Look...

215
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,821
You see this?

216
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:57,282
You see the pan?
That's me, I'm the pan.

217
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,619
I'm all dented, dime-a-dozen.
I'm just a schmo.

218
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,431
I don't know what kind of crazy ideas
you have in your head there, lady,

219
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,833
but I'm sure as hell
you could do a lot better than me.

220
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,084
Goodbye.

221
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,545
I don't think we can, Mr. Kowalski.

222
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,383
You could have ducked under the counter,
but you didn't.

223
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,553
You could have looked the other way,
but you didn't.

224
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,679
In fact,

225
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:22,724
you were willing to put yourself
in danger to save a perfect stranger.

226
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,184
Seems to me

227
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:27,020
you're just the kind of average Joe
the world needs right now.

228
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,439
You just don't know it yet.

229
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,733
That's why I had to show you.

230
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,406
We need you, Mr. Kowalski.

231
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,621
All right.

232
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,623
Call me Jacob.

233
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:47,791
Call me lally.

234
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,126
-Lally.

235
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,460
I gotta lock up.

236
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:56,884
Thanks.

237
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,635
Much better, Jacob.

238
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,190
I believe you know
how this works, Jacob.

239
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,274
Mm.

240
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,393
What did they say at the ministry?

241
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,853
Liu or Santos?

242
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,648
Officially,
the ministry takes no position.

243
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:57,152
Unofficially, smart money's on Santos.

244
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,446
Although anyone
would be better than Vogel.

245
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,781
Anyone?

246
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,745
I don't believe
he's on the ballot, kama.

247
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,997
He also happens to be a fugitive.

248
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,499
Is there a difference?

249
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,420
Spinning! Always with the spinning.

250
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:16,504
Jacob.

251
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,174
Welcome. You brilliant man.

252
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,550
Sorry.

253
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:23,262
I was absolutely sure
that professor Hicks would convince you.

254
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,680
Yeah.

255
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:28,725
You know me, pal. I can't pass up
a good portkey.

256
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,311
Mr. Scamander.

257
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:32,895
Professor Hicks.

258
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,138
- At long last.
- At long last.

259
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:38,568
So, professor Hicks and I,
we've corresponded for many years,

260
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:39,903
but we've never actually met.

261
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,406
So, her book on advanced charm casting
is a must-read.

262
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,824
Newt is far too kind.

263
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,910
Fantastic beasts is required reading
for all my fifth years.

264
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,454
Now, let me make some introductions.

265
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,873
So, this is, um,
bunty broadacre,

266
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,001
my indispensable assistant
for the past seven years.

267
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,628
Eight. Years.

268
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,047
And 164 days.

269
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,675
- Hmm.
- As you can see, indispensable.

270
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,968
And this is...

271
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,012
Yusuf kama.

272
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,388
Pleasure.

273
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:10,058
And you, obviously,
already made Jacob's acquaintance.

274
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,645
Newt.

275
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,524
So... so, this is my brother, theseus,

276
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,068
and, um, he works for the ministry.

277
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,279
Actually,
head of the British auror office.

278
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,824
Ah! Well, I'll have to ensure
my wand registration's up-to-date.

279
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,409
Yes.

280
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,678
Although, strictly speaking,
that doesn't fall within my purview.

281
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,299
Oh.

282
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,433
All right then.

283
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,936
Well, I imagine that you're all
wondering why you find yourselves here.

284
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,689
And in anticipation of that,

285
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:00,275
Dumbledore asked
that I convey a message.

286
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:05,572
So, Grindelwald has the ability
to see snatches of the future.

287
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,282
So, we have to assume

288
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:10,952
that he'll be able to anticipate
what we do before we do it.

289
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:15,165
So, if we hope to defeat him
and to save our world,

290
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,959
to save your world, Jacob,

291
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:21,630
then our best hope
is to confuse him.

292
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:25,384
'Scuse me.

293
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,970
I'm sorry. How do you confuse
a guy that can see the future?

294
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,764
Countersight.

295
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,474
Exactly.

296
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,394
The best plan being no plan.

297
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,145
Or, many overlapping plans.

298
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,438
Thus, confusion.

299
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,540
It's working on me right now.

300
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:44,319
In fact, Dumbledore asked
that I give you something, Jacob.

301
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,163
It's snakewood.

302
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,915
It's, uh, somewhat rare.

303
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,000
Are you kiddin' me right now?

304
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,168
Is this thing real?

305
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,545
Yes.

306
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,756
Well, it doesn't have a core,
so sort of, but yes.

307
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,716
It's sorta real?

308
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,764
More importantly,
where we're going, you'll need it.

309
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:17,436
Now, there's something for you too,
I think, theseus. Um...

310
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,855
Teddy, please let go now.

311
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,232
Teddy, please let go.

312
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,652
No. Teddy, will you behave?

313
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,362
This is theseus's...

314
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,619
Um, that's...

315
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,288
Well, of course.

316
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,458
Now everything makes sense.

317
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,210
Um, lally, I believe you were given
some reading material?

318
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,378
You know what they say.

319
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,231
A book can take you around
the world and back,

320
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,132
all you have to do is open it.

321
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,300
She ain't kiddin'.

322
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,802
Yes, uh, bunty, um...

323
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,929
That's for you.

324
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,015
I was told it was for your eyes only.

325
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:56,975
Oh.

326
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:09,905
And, kama.

327
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,032
I have what I need.

328
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,953
What about Tina?
Uh, is Tina coming?

329
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,622
Tina's not available.

330
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,335
Tina's been promoted,
she's very, very busy from...

331
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,504
Well, from what I understand.

332
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:29,257
Tina's been made head
of the American auror office.

333
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,818
- Oh.
- We know each other well.

334
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,595
She's quite a remarkable woman.

335
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,263
She is.

336
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,283
So, this is the team
that's gonna take down

337
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,893
the most dangerous wizard
we've faced in over a century.

338
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,938
A magizoologist,
his indispensable assistant,

339
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,272
a schoolteacher,

340
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,400
a wizard descended from
a very old French family, and...

341
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:52,239
A muggle baker with his fake wand.

342
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:55,116
Hey, we got you too, pal,

343
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,701
and his wand works.

344
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,540
Who wouldn't like our chances?

345
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,210
Oh. Uh...

346
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,193
You're all right, little one.

347
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,410
Berlin.

348
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,829
Wonderful.

349
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,253
Kama...

350
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,505
Stay safe.

351
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,020
I must be going too now, newt.

352
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,023
No one can know everything...

353
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,026
Not even you.

354
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,685
Right.

355
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,605
Well, here it is.

356
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,872
Huh.

357
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,422
German ministry of magic?

358
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,674
Yes.

359
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,554
I take it we're here for a reason.

360
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:25,141
Yes, we have a tea ceremony to attend,

361
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:28,520
and if we don't hurry up, we'll be late.

362
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,649
Jacob, stay with the group.

363
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:46,579
Santos! Santos! Santos!

364
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,916
Santos! Santos! Santos!

365
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,302
Evening...

366
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,888
Helmut.

367
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,598
Theseus.

368
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:07,809
Hey, hey.

369
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,562
They're with me.

370
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,954
Santos! Santos! Santos!

371
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,046
Incendio.

372
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,905
I take it we're not here
for the finger sandwiches.

373
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,825
Uh, no, lhave
a message to deliver.

374
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,202
A message?

375
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,496
To who?

376
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,958
Mr. Vogel,
it's a pleasure to be here.

377
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,460
It's an honor to meet you.

378
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,170
You are joking.

379
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,051
What am I even doing here?
Let's go outside.

380
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,886
I'm not very good in these situations.

381
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,137
These situations?

382
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,055
With all the people,

383
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,578
the fancy people.

384
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,018
Hello.

385
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,729
I saw you enter the room

386
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,523
and I thought to myself,

387
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:39,859
Edith,
that's an interesting-looking man.

388
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,945
Jacob Kowalski.

389
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,197
How are you?
Very nice to meet you.

390
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,158
And where is it you hail from,
Mr. Kowalski?

391
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,452
Queens.

392
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:50,912
Ah!

393
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:55,959
Sorry, herrvogel.
Sorry, I wonder if I could have a word?

394
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,336
Oh!

395
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,381
Merlin's beard,
it's Mr. Scamander, isn't it?

396
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,216
Herrvogel...

397
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:11,224
I have a message from a friend,
and it cannot wait.

398
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,105
Do what is right...

399
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,482
Not what is easy.

400
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,153
He said it was important
that I reach you tonight,

401
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:27,532
that you hear them tonight, the words.

402
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,535
It's time, sir.

403
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,542
Is he here?

404
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,419
In Berlin?

405
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,298
No, of course not.

406
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,801
Why leave Hogwarts
when the world outside is burning?

407
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,976
I thank you, Mr. Scamander.

408
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,679
Thank you.

409
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,140
Thank you.

410
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:40,355
I see many familiar faces here tonight.

411
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,149
Colleagues, friends...

412
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,526
Foes.

413
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,989
Within the next 48 hours,

414
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:53,701
you, along with the rest of
the wizarding world,

415
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,204
will choose our next great leader.

416
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:01,209
A choice that will shape our lives
for generations to come.

417
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:06,589
I have little doubt that,
no matter who should triumph,

418
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,218
the confederation will be in able hands.

419
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,928
Liu tao.

420
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,687
Vicéncia Santos.

421
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,566
Thank you, thank you.

422
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:31,280
It's in moments such as these
we are reminded

423
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:34,534
that it is this peaceful
transfer of power

424
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,619
which marks our humanity

425
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:40,748
and demonstrates to the world
that, despite our differences,

426
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,043
all voices deserve to be heard...

427
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:50,091
Even voices
which many may find disagreeable.

428
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,969
Newt.

429
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,263
Any of those lot look familiar to you?

430
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,061
Paris. The night that leta...

431
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,356
They were with Grindelwald.

432
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,582
And so,
after an extensive investigation,

433
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:28,713
the confederation has concluded
that insufficient evidence exists...

434
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,592
To prosecute gellert Grindelwald

435
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,261
for the crimes
against the muggle community

436
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,764
of which he was accused.

437
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:45,021
He is hereby absolved
of all his alleged crimes.

438
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,233
Are you kidding me?

439
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,235
They're letting the guy off?

440
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,945
I was there, he was killing people.

441
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,239
You're under arrest.

442
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,825
All of you.

443
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,243
Wands down!

444
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:08,836
Theseus.

445
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,422
Theseus!

446
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,801
Newt, newt. Not here.

447
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,470
Newt, we don't stand a chance.

448
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,972
Let's go. Newt,

449
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:22,600
they have the German ministry.
We've got to go.

450
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:23,683
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

451
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,145
It ain't right. That's notjustice.

452
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,022
"Extended investigation." I was there.

453
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,983
Were you there? Were you there?
I was there.

454
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,652
- You just let a killer off!
- Jacob.

455
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,028
Whoa!

456
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:35,947
We have to go. We have to go.

457
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,907
Jacob, let's go.

458
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:11,941
That's very good.

459
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,696
Her favorite.

460
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,826
Remember how
she begged mother to make it?

461
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,330
Ariana.

462
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:31,919
Mother claimed it calmed her,
but I think that was wishful thinking.

463
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,087
Albus.

464
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:35,882
I was there.

465
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,134
I grew up in the same house.

466
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:41,554
Everything you saw, I saw.

467
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,227
Everything.

468
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,950
Read the sign, you stupid sod.

469
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,960
I'm sorry to disturb you, Albus.

470
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,503
Tell me, what is it?

471
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,214
It's Berlin.

472
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,466
What happened?

473
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,762
Vogel has absolved gellert
of all his crimes.

474
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,598
He's free. He says there's no proof.

475
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,937
He tried to arrest aurors who were there
the night leta Lestrange was murdered.

476
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,533
Rather disappointing.

477
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,238
I'm going to need someone
to cover my morning classes.

478
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,997
Can I impose on you?

479
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,750
Of course.
And, Albus, please be...

480
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,710
I'll do my best.

481
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,839
Evening, aberforth.

482
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,174
Evening, Minerva.

483
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,635
Apologies for calling you a stupid sod.

484
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,388
Apology accepted.

485
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,852
I'm afraid I'll have to
cut our evening short.

486
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,896
Off to save the world, are we?

487
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,065
That will take a better man than me.

488
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,530
Don't ask.

489
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,362
There are thousands in the streets
chanting your name.

490
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,281
You're a free man.

491
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,913
Tell the others to prepare to leave.

492
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,458
- Tonight?
- Tomorrow.

493
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,419
We'll have a visitor in the morning.

494
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,509
Why does it stay with him?

495
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,804
It must sense what he's about to do.

496
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,141
And you're sure...

497
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,853
That he can kill Dumbledore?

498
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,648
His pain is his power.

499
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:49,701
The man that I am inquiring about
is the head of the British auror office.

500
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:53,037
How can you have misplaced
the head of the British auror office?

501
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,627
As our contention said,
since he was never in our custody,

502
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,087
we never misplaced him.

503
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:04,149
Sir, there were dozens of people there,
any one of them could corroborate...

504
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:06,213
- And your name is?
- Let's get out of here.

505
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,928
Wait a minute, that's the guy.

506
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,097
Come here. Come here.

507
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,264
Excuse me!

508
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,812
That's the guy.
He knows where theseus is.

509
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:18,895
Hello!

510
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,816
Where's theseus?

511
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:24,860
That's him.
He knows about theseus.

512
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:47,424
Newt.

513
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,553
Ah.

514
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,232
Albus.

515
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,989
Theseus has been taken to the erkstag.

516
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,533
Wait, no,
but the erkstag shut down years ago.

517
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:17,288
Yes, well, it's the ministry's
secret little bed and breakfast now.

518
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,957
You'll need this to see him.

519
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,692
And one of these.

520
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,464
- Mm-hmm.
- And this.

521
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:31,760
Wait, wait, wait.

522
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:36,557
I trust you're enjoying
your wand, Mr. Kowalski?

523
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,727
Me? Oh, uh... yeah, thank you,
Mr. Dumbledore.

524
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,187
It's a real pip.

525
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,521
I advise you to keep it close.

526
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,356
- Professor Hicks.
- Dumbledore.

527
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,860
Assuming you're not othennise engaged,
and frankly even if you are,

528
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,613
I encourage you to attend
tonight's candidates' dinner.

529
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,239
Take Mr. Kowalski.

530
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,483
I'm quite certain
there'll be an assassination attempt.

531
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,828
Anything you can do to scotch that
will be greatly appreciated.

532
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:58,912
It's my pleasure.

533
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,372
I shall welcome the challenge.

534
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,917
Besides, I'll have Jacob with me.

535
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:04,668
Oh, not to worry.

536
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:08,047
Professor Hicks's defensive magic
is superb.

537
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,174
Until next time.

538
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,800
Such a flatterer.

539
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:14,678
Well, not really. It is superb.

540
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:16,722
Albus!

541
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,641
I was just wondering...

542
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:22,186
Yes.

543
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,272
- The case.
- Yes.

544
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:28,192
Rest assured, it's in safe hands.

545
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:43,165
Can I help you?

546
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:45,334
Yes.

547
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:48,295
I'd like to have this case
replicated, please.

548
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:49,922
Certainly.

549
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,718
Oh. No, you mustn't open it.

550
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:58,847
Um, I mean, it's not necessary.

551
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,559
The interior isn't important.

552
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:05,980
I see no reason I can't make you one.

553
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,327
If you leave it here.

554
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,787
Oh. No...

555
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,373
I couldn't leave it.

556
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,918
And I'll be needing more than one.

557
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,421
You see, um...

558
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:35,009
My husband,
He's a bit absentminded.

559
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,011
He's always forgetting things.

560
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,096
Just the other day,
he forgot he was married to me.

561
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,018
Can you imagine?

562
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,773
But I love him.

563
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,360
Exactly how many were you thinking?

564
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,363
Half a dozen,

565
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:59,116
and I'll need them in two days' time.

566
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,418
Show your hands.

567
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,008
Who are you?

568
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:18,677
My name is Yusuf kama.

569
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:21,847
Who's our visitor?

570
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,265
I'm an admirer.

571
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,060
You murdered his sister.

572
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,812
Her name was leta.

573
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,191
Leta Lestrange.

574
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,443
Ah, yes.

575
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,695
You and your sister
share an ancient bloodline.

576
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,197
Shared.

577
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,157
That's the only thing we shared.

578
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,662
Dumbledore sent you, am I right?

579
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,790
He fears
you're in possession of a creature.

580
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,751
He fears the use you may put it to.

581
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,921
He sent me here to spy on you.

582
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,050
What would you like me to tell him?

583
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:01,970
Queenie.

584
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:05,432
Is he telling the truth?

585
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,530
What else?

586
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,448
Even though he believes in you,

587
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:24,326
he holds you responsible
for his sister's death.

588
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,330
He carries
her absence with him every day.

589
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:33,335
Every breath he takes
is a reminder that she breathes no more.

590
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,547
Then I presume you won't mind

591
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,632
if I relieve you
of your sister's memory.

592
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:45,264
Right?

593
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,599
Right.

594
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,622
There.

595
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,751
Better?

596
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,503
Ithoughtso.

597
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:21,008
When we allow ourselves to be consumed
by anger, the only victim is ourself.

598
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,221
Now, we were just about to depart.

599
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:28,098
Perhaps you'd like to join us?

600
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:33,103
Come, we can talk some more
about our mutual friend, Dumbledore.

601
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,238
After you.

602
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,703
Hello, credence.

603
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,964
Do you know
what it's like to have no one?

604
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,216
To always be alone?

605
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,760
It's you.

606
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,683
You're the one sending messages
in the mirror.

607
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,644
I'm a Dumbledore.

608
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:40,272
You abandoned me.

609
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:45,777
The same blood
that runs my veins runs yours.

610
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:57,623
He's not here for you.

611
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:59,249
He's here for me.

612
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,882
Things are not quite
what they appear, credence...

613
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:52,010
No matter what you've been told.

614
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,681
My name is aurelius.

615
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:57,557
He's lied to you.

616
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,017
Kindled your hate.

617
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:02,289
What he's told you isn't true...

618
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:06,668
But we do share the same blood.

619
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,630
You are a Dumbledore.

620
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,021
I'm sorry for your pain.

621
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,357
We didn't know, I promise.

622
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:07,062
No entrance! Access prohibited!

623
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:25,580
I've come to see my brother.

624
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:27,582
His name is theseus scamander.

625
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:37,843
Sorry, that's, uh...

626
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,304
Wand.

627
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,612
Oh, that's, uh...

628
01:00:57,696 --> 01:00:59,990
I'm... I'm a magizoologist.

629
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,271
He's perfectly harmless. He's...

630
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:04,703
He's just a pet, really.

631
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,331
Sorry.

632
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:12,460
That's Teddy.

633
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,337
He's a total nightmare, truth be told.

634
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:15,922
They stay here.

635
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,905
So, how will I know where to find him?

636
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:41,907
He's your brother?

637
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:44,201
Yes.

638
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:46,912
He will be the one
who looks like your brother.

639
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:53,001
I will be back, pick.

640
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,711
On my word.

641
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,719
"I'll be back, pick.

642
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,013
"On my word."

643
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:09,434
And I'll be minister of magic
one day.

644
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,308
Take us 'round the back.

645
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:51,559
It's not safe here.

646
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:54,353
Roll it down.

647
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:55,897
What?

648
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:58,191
The window.

649
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,609
Roll it down.

650
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,915
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

651
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,796
No. No!

652
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,681
Those people...

653
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,350
Aren't suggesting we listen to them.

654
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:34,436
They aren't asking us to listen.

655
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,438
They're demanding it.

656
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:41,026
You're actually proposing that
that man be allowed to stand?

657
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,444
Yes.

658
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:44,529
Yes, let him stand.

659
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,660
Gellert Grindelwald
wants a muggle-wizard war,

660
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:53,788
and if he gets his wish,
he won't just destroy their world,

661
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:55,206
he'll destroy ours as well.

662
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:57,167
Which is why he cannot win.

663
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,378
Let him stand as a candidate.

664
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:02,213
Let the people vote.

665
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:04,424
When he loses,
the people will have spoken.

666
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:07,844
But deny them their voices,

667
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,597
and those streets will run with blood.

668
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:34,829
Theseus.

669
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:41,086
Theseus.

670
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:18,808
Lally,

671
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,019
the guy with the hair...

672
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,813
Sitting next to Edith.

673
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,399
He looks like he can kill somebody.

674
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:30,111
He also looks like my uncle Dominic.

675
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:33,823
Is your uncle Dominic
the nonnegian minister of magic?

676
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:36,659
Didn't think so.

677
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,023
Queenie.

678
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:09,317
Queenie.

679
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:22,539
Madam Santos, a pleasure.

680
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:25,792
Your supporters are in fine voice.

681
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:29,295
As are yours, Mr. Grindelwald.

682
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,525
Rescuing me, are you?

683
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,568
- That's the general idea.
- Huh.

684
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:55,071
And I presume this...

685
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:58,116
Whatever it is that you are doing,
is strategic.

686
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,285
Yes, a technique called limbic mimicry.

687
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:03,788
It discourages violent engagement,
theoretically.

688
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:06,457
I've only actually ever
attempted it once before.

689
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,877
- And the results?
- Uh...

690
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:11,254
Inconclusive.

691
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,148
Course that was a laboratory setting

692
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,592
and the conditions
were strictly controlled, and the...

693
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,515
Well, the current conditions
are more volatile,

694
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:19,613
so making it less predictive
of the ultimate outcome.

695
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,931
The ultimate outcome presumably...

696
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:27,103
Being our survival.

697
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:22,575
Well done, come on.

698
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,749
And the plan is?

699
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,000
Hold this.

700
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:37,090
[{Snonng]

701
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,856
What the bloody hell was that for?

702
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,478
Um...

703
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:52,188
We're gonna need some help.

704
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,324
Follow me.

705
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,372
Come on.

706
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,717
You're not swiveling properly.

707
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,301
Swivel...

708
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:24,470
Swivel, but delicately.

709
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,640
I'm swiveling
like you're swiveling, newt.

710
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,350
I don't believe you are.

711
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:49,746
Swivel.

712
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:04,343
Go to him.

713
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:13,685
Queenie.

714
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:19,734
Tell him it's all right.

715
01:11:20,568 --> 01:11:22,153
I can see he's failed.

716
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,655
He'll have another chance.

717
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,785
It's his loyalty I most value.

718
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,612
Stay here.

719
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:25,925
Oh.

720
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:28,219
Apologies.

721
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:34,934
Hmm.

722
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,687
Oh, boy.

723
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,247
Let her go.

724
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:58,040
Excuse me?

725
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:09,135
- Assassin!
- Huh?

726
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:20,802
No, wait.

727
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:36,818
Newt!

728
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:41,615
Accio!

729
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:43,784
Grab the tie.

730
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,251
That was a portkey.

731
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:35,920
Yeah.

732
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,841
Well done, you two.

733
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:06,617
Not that either of you asked,

734
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,911
but I would highly recommend
learning charms.

735
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:09,912
Lally.

736
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:11,413
What kept you two?

737
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:14,416
Uh, we encountered
some complications. You?

738
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,461
We encountered some complications.

739
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,467
Jacob tried to murder Grindelwald?

740
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,427
It's a long story.

741
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,263
Is it really snakewood?

742
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:29,056
Yes, it's really snakewood.

743
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:31,892
- Can I...
- Mm-mm.

744
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,852
Very dangerous.

745
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,521
It's very powerful.

746
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:38,565
It's rare. If it got in the wrong hands,
you know...

747
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:39,692
Mess you up.

748
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,402
Where did you get it?

749
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,113
I got it for Christmas.

750
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,281
Jacob,

751
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:46,657
look who I found.

752
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:47,825
Hey.

753
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:50,286
It's my wizard friends,
newt and theseus.

754
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:52,746
We're like this, okay,
and that's me right there.

755
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:55,165
I gotta go. All right, have fun.

756
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,459
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

757
01:19:58,210 --> 01:19:59,420
Can you believe this place?

758
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:00,814
They got pint-sized little
witches and wizards

759
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:01,898
running around here.

760
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:03,173
You don't say.

761
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:05,175
I was the assassin.

762
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:07,678
Newt and theseus both went to Hogwarts.

763
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:09,864
Oh, I knew that.
Well, they're being very nice to me.

764
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:11,848
The Slytherin boys over there,
they gave me these.

765
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,726
They're delicious. Who wants one?

766
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:16,645
I never cared for cockroach clusters
much myself,

767
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:19,273
although honeydukes
are supposed to be the best.

768
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,155
Off you go.

769
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:27,948
McGonagall.

770
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:29,783
Albus.

771
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:30,868
Well done.

772
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,578
All of you, well done.

773
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:33,579
Congratulations.

774
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,372
-Congratulations? 4ndeed.

775
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:38,709
Professor Hicks managed
to foil an assassination.

776
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:41,920
And you are alive and you are well.

777
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:44,882
The fact that everything didn't go
precisely to plan

778
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:46,258
was precisely the plan.

779
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:47,760
Countersight 101.

780
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,304
Albus, forgive me,
but aren't we back where we started?

781
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:53,182
Actually, I would argue
that things are...

782
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,434
A great deal worse.

783
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:58,937
You haven't told them, have you?

784
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:03,233
Grindelwald's been allowed
to stand in the election.

785
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:05,569
- What?
- But how?

786
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:09,782
Because Vogel chose easy over right.

787
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:33,347
Hmm.

788
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:35,681
It's all right.

789
01:21:36,016 --> 01:21:37,226
Bhutan.

790
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:39,311
Correct. Three points to hufflepuff.

791
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:43,774
The kingdom of Bhutan
sits high in the eastern himalayas.

792
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:47,653
It's a place of indescribable beauty.

793
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:51,240
Some of our most important magic
has its origins there.

794
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:56,286
They say if you listen carefully enough,
the past whispers to you.

795
01:21:57,579 --> 01:22:00,124
It also happens to be
where the election will be held.

796
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:01,542
He can't win, can he?

797
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:04,002
Only a few days ago
he was a fugitive from justice.

798
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:09,550
Now he is an official candidate in the
international confederation of wizards.

799
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:14,430
Dangerous times favor dangerous men.

800
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:20,102
By the way, we'll be dining
with my brother in the village.

801
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:23,063
Should you need anything before then,
Minerva is here.

802
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:25,899
Dumbledore has a brother?

803
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:30,195
Huh.

804
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:45,294
Here we are.

805
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:51,383
Bunty, you're here.

806
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:52,551
Yes.

807
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:55,429
How is she?

808
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:56,555
Oh, she's fine.

809
01:22:57,598 --> 01:22:58,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

810
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:00,350
What's Alfie done now?

811
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:02,745
Wait, you've not been biting
Timothy's bottom again, have you?

812
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:07,274
Miss broadacre, I trust my brother
has been a gracious host?

813
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:09,985
Yes, ever so gracious.

814
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:11,653
I'm delighted to hear.

815
01:23:11,737 --> 01:23:15,282
Uh, so, rooms have been
arranged for you in the village

816
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:18,869
and aberforth here
will prepare you a delicious dinner,

817
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,537
his own recipe.

818
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:29,213
There's more of that if you want it.

819
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:34,927
Thank you.

820
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:36,762
Thanks.

821
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:41,391
Astonishing.

822
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:44,770
Never has something that looks
so repellent tasted so delicious.

823
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:46,939
Who is this little one?

824
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,023
Do you mind?

825
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:50,651
She's a qilin, Jacob.

826
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:52,569
She's incredibly rare.

827
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:55,155
One of the most beloved creatures
in the wizarding world.

828
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:59,326
'Cause she can see into your soul.

829
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:00,619
Oh. Oh!

830
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,206
You're kidding me.

831
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:10,212
No. So, if you are good and worthy,
then she'll see that.

832
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:14,049
But if, on the other hand,
you're cruel and deceitful,

833
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:16,009
then she'll know that too.

834
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,262
Oh, yeah?

835
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,931
Does she just tell you that
or...

836
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,141
Not exactly tells.

837
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:28,063
Well, she bows, but only in the presence
of someone truly pure of heart.

838
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:31,817
I mean,
almost none of us are, of course,

839
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,403
no matter how good of a person
one tries to be.

840
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:38,615
There was actually a time,
many, many years ago,

841
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:41,118
when the qilin chose who'd lead us.

842
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,329
No...

843
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:47,499
Whoa. Woop. Whoa...

844
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:51,378
Okay. All right, already.

845
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:55,339
Here you go.

846
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:57,426
Thriving.

847
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:59,052
He's just hungry. Look at him.

848
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:01,616
- She really likes you, Jacob.
- Oh, all right.

849
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:05,434
It's okay.

850
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:16,361
Come with me.

851
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:19,489
I'll help you.

852
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:23,368
He's your son, aberforth.

853
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:27,748
He needs you.

854
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,095
Newt.

855
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,942
Come in.

856
01:25:56,610 --> 01:26:00,364
Albus, the mirror downstairs,
there's a message.

857
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:01,448
Close the door.

858
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:11,291
It's from credence, newt.

859
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:17,339
The summer gellert and I fell in love...

860
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:20,008
My brother fell in love as well,

861
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:22,386
with a girl from the hollow.

862
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:25,180
She was sent away.

863
01:26:26,973 --> 01:26:29,351
There were rumors about a child.

864
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:32,145
Credence...

865
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:33,730
He's a Dumbledore.

866
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:39,152
If I'd been a better friend...

867
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,322
To aberforth,
if I'd been a better brother...

868
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:45,867
He might have confided in me.

869
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:49,121
Perhaps things
would have been different,

870
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:50,747
and this boy...

871
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:54,334
Could have been part of our lives,
part of our family.

872
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:03,301
Credence can't be saved,
I know you know that.

873
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:07,973
But he may yet be able to save us.

874
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:15,689
Phoenix ash.

875
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:20,110
The bird comes to him
because he's dying, newt.

876
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:22,863
I know the signs.

877
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:25,073
You see...

878
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:30,203
My sister was an obscurial.

879
01:27:31,121 --> 01:27:34,249
And like credence,
she never learned to express her magic.

880
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:38,545
Over time it grew darker
and began to poison her.

881
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:43,467
Worst of all, none of us
were capable of easing her pain.

882
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:49,389
Can you tell me how it is that...

883
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,017
Or how it came to an end for her?

884
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:58,690
Gellert and I had made plans
to go away together.

885
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:03,487
My brother didn't approve.

886
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:05,781
One night, he confronted us.

887
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:08,784
Voices were raised, threats made.

888
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:12,329
Aberforth drew his wand,
which was foolish.

889
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:18,335
I drew my wand,
which was even more foolish.

890
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:22,798
Gellertjust laughed.

891
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,593
No one heard Ariana
coming down the stairs.

892
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:32,057
Can't say for certain it was my...

893
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:34,643
Spell.

894
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:41,525
Doesn't really matter.

895
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:46,112
One minute she was there,
and the next she was gone.

896
01:28:47,197 --> 01:28:48,949
I'm so sorry, Albus.

897
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:54,704
But if it's of any comfort,
perhaps she was saved some pain...

898
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:58,458
Don't disappoint me, newt.

899
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:01,336
You of all people.

900
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:05,006
Your honesty is a gift...

901
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:09,719
Even if at times a painful one.

902
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:17,936
Our friends downstairs will be tired
and wanting to go home.

903
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,230
You should... you should go.

904
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:37,581
Albus, lally said something earlier

905
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:40,625
about most of us
being ultimately imperfect.

906
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:46,047
But even if we make mistakes,
terrible things...

907
01:29:47,674 --> 01:29:50,176
We can try to make things right.

908
01:29:52,762 --> 01:29:54,389
And that's what matters...

909
01:29:58,101 --> 01:29:59,603
Trying.

910
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:16,786
We're with you.

911
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:18,580
Thank you.

912
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:29,883
Our time is close,
my brothers and sisters.

913
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:32,802
Days of hiding are over.

914
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,766
The world will hear our voice.

915
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:42,604
And it will be deafening.

916
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:53,657
You didn't come here
to betray Dumbledore...

917
01:30:54,908 --> 01:30:57,577
You know in your pure-blood heart...

918
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:01,164
Your place is here.

919
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:06,127
To believe in me
is to believe in yourself.

920
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:20,850
Prove your loyalty, Mr. Kama.

921
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:45,500
Vulnera sanentur.

922
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:50,380
Rennervate vulnera sanentur.

923
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:56,177
Rennervate vulnera sanentur.

924
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:04,102
Rennervate vulnera sanentur.

925
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:09,982
There.

926
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:12,944
There, there.

927
01:32:14,988 --> 01:32:16,239
There.

928
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:19,826
Come, look.

929
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:24,789
Hmm.

930
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:27,792
This is why we are special.

931
01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:34,674
To conceal our powers
is not merely an affront to ourselves...

932
01:32:36,301 --> 01:32:37,635
It's sinful.

933
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:53,860
Was there another?

934
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:56,321
Another?

935
01:32:57,614 --> 01:33:00,617
That night, was there another qilin?

936
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:05,413
I don't think so...

937
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:08,792
That's twice you failed me.

938
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:12,796
Do you not understand
the danger you put me in?

939
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:18,343
One last chance.

940
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:20,178
Understood?

941
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:24,474
Find it.

942
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:20,572
Hey, newt.

943
01:34:21,447 --> 01:34:23,032
What is this place?

944
01:34:24,033 --> 01:34:26,035
The room we require.

945
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:34,002
I trust you all have the tickets
that bunty gave you?

946
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:36,588
You'll need them to
gain access to the ceremony.

947
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:37,755
What do you think, newt?

948
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:39,507
Can you tell which one is yours?

949
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:43,219
Good. I'd be worried if you could.

950
01:34:43,303 --> 01:34:45,555
I assume
the qilin's in one of these cases.

951
01:34:45,638 --> 01:34:46,723
Yes.

952
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:48,683
- Well, which one is it?
- Which one indeed.

953
01:34:49,142 --> 01:34:51,394
Ooh, it's like
a three-card monte thing.

954
01:34:51,477 --> 01:34:53,313
Like a shell game thing.

955
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:54,522
Like a short con.

956
01:34:56,566 --> 01:34:58,484
Never mind, it's a muggle thing.

957
01:34:58,568 --> 01:35:00,945
Grindelwald will do anything
within his powers

958
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:03,364
to get his hands on our rare friend.

959
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:05,658
Therefore, it's essential that we keep

960
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:08,912
whoever he dispatches
on his behalf guessing...

961
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:12,081
So the qilin
gets to the ceremony safely.

962
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:18,004
If, by teatime, the qilin,
not to mention all of us,

963
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:20,757
are still alive,

964
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:23,718
we should consider
our efforts a success.

965
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:27,138
For the record, nobody ever died
playing three-card monte.

966
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:30,558
An important distinction.

967
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:34,520
All right, everybody choose a case
and we'll be on our way.

968
01:35:34,604 --> 01:35:38,274
Mr. Kowalski, you and I
will proceed together first.

969
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:45,865
Okay.

970
01:36:10,807 --> 01:36:12,868
I'm looking fonnard
to you educating me a little further

971
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:15,603
on the finer points
of three-card monte.

972
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:18,731
Mm.

973
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:22,485
My pleasure.

974
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:29,951
Well, good luck, everybody.

975
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:33,787
Good luck.

976
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:37,625
And you too, bunty girl.

977
01:36:40,503 --> 01:36:41,921
See you, bunty.

978
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:57,770
It is not lost

979
01:36:57,854 --> 01:37:02,275
on those of us in leadership
that we are currently a world divided.

980
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:05,987
Each day
brings talk of another conspiracy.

981
01:37:06,696 --> 01:37:08,781
Each hour another dark whisper.

982
01:37:09,324 --> 01:37:12,744
These whispers have
only increased in recent days

983
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:15,663
with the addition of a third candidate.

984
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:20,877
There is only one way
to leave absolutely no doubt

985
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:27,175
that a worthy candidate exists amongst
the three you have been presented.

986
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:49,781
As every schoolboy and girl knows,

987
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:56,329
the qilin is the purest of creatures
in our wonderful magical world.

988
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,915
It cannot be deceived.

989
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,086
Let the qilin unite us.

990
01:38:23,481 --> 01:38:25,358
Santos! Santos! Santos!

991
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:35,576
Santos! Santos! Santos!

992
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:39,288
Santos! Santos! Santos!

993
01:38:51,509 --> 01:38:52,510
Come.

994
01:38:56,222 --> 01:38:57,974
Where to, next?

995
01:38:58,516 --> 01:39:00,268
Uh, this is where I leave you.

996
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:03,146
I'm... I'm sorry, you're what?

997
01:39:03,229 --> 01:39:04,647
Leaving me?

998
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:07,358
I have to meet someone else,
Mr. Kowalski.

999
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:09,193
Not to worry...

1000
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:11,612
You'll be perfectly safe.

1001
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:17,076
You don't have the qilin.

1002
01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:21,038
Feel free to drop the case
at the first hint of trouble.

1003
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:24,876
One other thing,
if you don't mind me saying.

1004
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:27,462
You should stop doubting yourself.

1005
01:39:27,545 --> 01:39:30,423
You have something most men
go their entire lives without.

1006
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:31,924
Do you know what that is?

1007
01:39:33,551 --> 01:39:35,761
A heart that is full.

1008
01:39:36,637 --> 01:39:38,639
Only a truly brave man

1009
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:43,686
could open himself up
so honestly and completely, as you do.

1010
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:14,008
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1011
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:16,928
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1012
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:20,181
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1013
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:30,084
Cases, please.

1014
01:41:48,894 --> 01:41:49,894
Hey, fellas.

1015
01:41:54,942 --> 01:41:56,152
Woo-hoo-hoo.

1016
01:41:58,279 --> 01:41:59,947
He's angry.

1017
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:19,050
Wait. Open them,
make sure it's in there.

1018
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:20,134
Idiots.

1019
01:44:05,906 --> 01:44:07,366
How long does he have?

1020
01:44:48,657 --> 01:44:50,659
Here. Hey. Hi.

1021
01:44:50,743 --> 01:44:52,036
You're in danger, all right?

1022
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:53,704
- You need to leave.
- Well...

1023
01:44:54,872 --> 01:44:57,374
I can't... I can't go, okay?

1024
01:44:57,458 --> 01:44:58,834
I can't come home.

1025
01:44:58,918 --> 01:45:00,294
It's too late for me, all right?

1026
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:02,671
Some mistakes, they're just too big.

1027
01:45:02,755 --> 01:45:04,757
Can you listen to me?

1028
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:07,051
There's no time. I was followed.

1029
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:10,763
I gave 'em the slip, but it won't
be long before they find me.

1030
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:12,406
- They're gonna find us.
- I don't care.

1031
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:15,184
All I got is us.

1032
01:45:15,267 --> 01:45:16,727
I make no sense without us.

1033
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:19,647
Jacob, what? Come on...

1034
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:21,690
I don't love you anymore.
Just get outta here.

1035
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:24,109
You're the worst liar in the world,
queenie Goldstein.

1036
01:45:25,778 --> 01:45:26,862
You hear that?

1037
01:45:26,946 --> 01:45:28,447
What? No.

1038
01:45:28,531 --> 01:45:30,074
That's a sign.

1039
01:45:30,157 --> 01:45:31,367
Oh, man.

1040
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:33,369
- Oh, come on.
- Come here, come here.

1041
01:45:33,786 --> 01:45:35,120
Close your eyes.

1042
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,915
Please close your eyes.

1043
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:41,460
You know what Dumbledore said to me?

1044
01:45:43,712 --> 01:45:46,048
He said that I got a full heart.

1045
01:45:50,177 --> 01:45:51,512
He's wrong.

1046
01:45:52,263 --> 01:45:54,807
I'm always
gonna have room in there for you.

1047
01:45:56,183 --> 01:45:57,309
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1048
01:45:57,393 --> 01:45:58,727
You know it.

1049
01:45:59,895 --> 01:46:01,146
Look at me.

1050
01:46:04,066 --> 01:46:05,651
Queenie Goldstein.

1051
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:13,177
Mr. Scamander.

1052
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:15,095
We've never been properly introduced.

1053
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:18,098
Henrietta fischer...

1054
01:47:18,182 --> 01:47:19,808
Herr Vogel's attaché.

1055
01:47:19,892 --> 01:47:21,977
Ah. Yes, uh,

1056
01:47:22,061 --> 01:47:22,978
hello.

1057
01:47:23,062 --> 01:47:25,105
I can take you up.

1058
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:28,901
There's a private entrance
for members of the high council.

1059
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:31,779
If you just follow me.

1060
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:33,489
I'm sorry, why would you do that?

1061
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:35,366
Take me up?

1062
01:47:36,075 --> 01:47:38,410
Isn't it obvious?

1063
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:41,080
No, frankly, it's, uh, not.

1064
01:47:45,668 --> 01:47:47,544
Dumbledore sent me.

1065
01:47:49,672 --> 01:47:53,384
I know what you have
in that case, Mr. Scamander.

1066
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:16,782
He should be here any minute.

1067
01:49:20,596 --> 01:49:22,014
What kept you?

1068
01:49:36,612 --> 01:49:39,156
I thank
the candidates for their words.

1069
01:49:39,281 --> 01:49:45,579
Each represents a distinct vision
of how we will not shape only our world,

1070
01:49:45,662 --> 01:49:48,165
but the non-magical world as well.

1071
01:49:49,541 --> 01:49:54,671
Which brings us to the most important
part of our ceremony...

1072
01:49:54,755 --> 01:49:56,965
The walk of the qilin.

1073
01:51:26,513 --> 01:51:28,765
The qilin has seen.

1074
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:31,185
Seen goodness,

1075
01:51:31,685 --> 01:51:33,729
strength...

1076
01:51:33,812 --> 01:51:38,483
Qualities essential
to lead and to guide us.

1077
01:51:40,694 --> 01:51:42,321
Who do you see?

1078
01:51:58,962 --> 01:52:02,925
Gellert Grindelwald is the new leader
of the magical world...

1079
01:52:03,008 --> 01:52:04,718
By acclamation.

1080
01:52:44,174 --> 01:52:46,885
This is the man
who tried to take my life.

1081
01:52:48,053 --> 01:52:52,182
This man, who has no magic...

1082
01:52:53,058 --> 01:52:56,228
Who would marry a witch
and pollute our blood,

1083
01:52:56,311 --> 01:52:59,523
create a forbidden union
that would make us less...

1084
01:53:00,315 --> 01:53:02,359
Make us weak, like his kind.

1085
01:53:04,403 --> 01:53:06,113
He's not alone, my friends.

1086
01:53:07,656 --> 01:53:10,701
There are thousands
who seek to do the same.

1087
01:53:12,452 --> 01:53:15,831
There can only be one response
to such vermin.

1088
01:53:30,095 --> 01:53:31,513
Crucio.

1089
01:53:35,309 --> 01:53:36,977
Make him stop!

1090
01:53:37,602 --> 01:53:42,607
Our war with the Muggles begins today.

1091
01:54:00,167 --> 01:54:01,918
Jacob.

1092
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,835
He's lying to you.

1093
01:54:46,505 --> 01:54:48,715
That creature is dead.

1094
01:54:56,014 --> 01:54:58,266
Not now. Wait.

1095
01:55:03,021 --> 01:55:04,221
He did it to trick you.

1096
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:07,442
He killed it and bewitched it

1097
01:55:07,526 --> 01:55:10,237
so that
you might think him worthy to lead.

1098
01:55:12,656 --> 01:55:14,783
But he doesn't want to lead you.

1099
01:55:17,369 --> 01:55:19,371
He just wants you to follow.

1100
01:55:20,122 --> 01:55:21,289
Words.

1101
01:55:22,749 --> 01:55:25,085
Words designed to deceive.

1102
01:55:25,794 --> 01:55:28,064
To make you doubt what you've seen
with your own two eyes.

1103
01:55:28,088 --> 01:55:29,690
There were two qilins
born that night.

1104
01:55:29,714 --> 01:55:31,967
A twin. And I know that...

1105
01:55:33,385 --> 01:55:34,511
I know that...

1106
01:55:34,594 --> 01:55:35,720
Because?

1107
01:55:40,058 --> 01:55:42,310
Because you have no proof.

1108
01:55:43,186 --> 01:55:45,272
Because there was no second qilin.

1109
01:55:46,606 --> 01:55:48,024
Am I not right?

1110
01:55:48,108 --> 01:55:49,293
Its mother had been killed, it...

1111
01:55:49,317 --> 01:55:51,862
Then where is it now, Mr. Scamander?

1112
01:56:17,721 --> 01:56:19,890
No one can know everything, newt.

1113
01:56:19,973 --> 01:56:21,183
Remember?

1114
01:56:51,588 --> 01:56:52,923
I don't get it.

1115
01:57:05,143 --> 01:57:07,479
She can't hear you, little one.

1116
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:10,398
Not here...

1117
01:57:12,192 --> 01:57:14,611
But perhaps somewhere she's listening.

1118
01:57:18,156 --> 01:57:20,492
This is the true qilin.

1119
01:57:21,785 --> 01:57:22,994
Look at it...

1120
01:57:23,537 --> 01:57:25,664
You can see it with your own eyes.

1121
01:57:32,379 --> 01:57:34,923
This can't be allowed to stand.

1122
01:57:35,006 --> 01:57:36,591
The vote must be taken again.

1123
01:57:37,509 --> 01:57:40,178
Come on, Anton. Do something.

1124
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:09,708
You...

1125
01:58:10,292 --> 01:58:12,043
No, no, no, please.

1126
01:58:37,444 --> 01:58:39,279
I'm honored.

1127
01:58:40,447 --> 01:58:43,575
Butjust as two of you
were born that night,

1128
01:58:43,658 --> 01:58:46,953
there's another here, equally worthy.

1129
01:58:48,413 --> 01:58:50,248
I'm certain of it.

1130
01:59:05,764 --> 01:59:07,098
Thank you.

1131
02:01:59,729 --> 02:02:01,648
Who will love you now, Dumbledore?

1132
02:02:04,692 --> 02:02:06,152
You're all alone.

1133
02:02:56,744 --> 02:02:58,663
I was never your enemy.

1134
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:08,715
Then, or now.

1135
02:03:49,589 --> 02:03:51,591
Did you ever think of me?

1136
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:55,511
Always.

1137
02:04:02,894 --> 02:04:04,270
Come home.

1138
02:04:52,777 --> 02:04:55,196
Here she is.

1139
02:04:56,197 --> 02:04:57,865
Well done, bunty.

1140
02:05:01,828 --> 02:05:03,079
Come on, little one.

1141
02:05:04,414 --> 02:05:07,083
I'm sorry.
I must have given you an awful fright.

1142
02:05:07,166 --> 02:05:08,376
No, I think, um...

1143
02:05:08,459 --> 02:05:12,547
Sometimes it takes losing something
to realize quite how much it means.

1144
02:05:15,508 --> 02:05:17,593
And sometimes you just...

1145
02:05:21,139 --> 02:05:23,141
Sometimes you just know.

1146
02:05:33,526 --> 02:05:35,486
Right, in you pop.

1147
02:05:37,739 --> 02:05:39,782
Mr. Kowalski.

1148
02:05:41,242 --> 02:05:43,119
I owe you an apology.

1149
02:05:43,286 --> 02:05:47,749
It... it was never my intent
for you to suffer the cruciatus curse.

1150
02:05:48,791 --> 02:05:50,001
Yeah...

1151
02:05:50,084 --> 02:05:52,462
Well, you know, we got queenie back,
so we're square.

1152
02:05:52,545 --> 02:05:54,589
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1153
02:05:55,548 --> 02:05:57,091
Can I keep this?

1154
02:05:57,175 --> 02:05:58,843
For, like, old times' sake?

1155
02:06:01,387 --> 02:06:05,016
I can't think of anyone more deserving.

1156
02:06:07,351 --> 02:06:08,978
Thanks, professor.

1157
02:06:29,707 --> 02:06:30,792
Remarkable.

1158
02:06:30,875 --> 02:06:31,709
But how?

1159
02:06:31,793 --> 02:06:33,395
I thought you couldn't
move against one another.

1160
02:06:33,419 --> 02:06:34,587
We didn't.

1161
02:06:35,296 --> 02:06:38,132
He sought to kill, I sought to protect.

1162
02:06:38,216 --> 02:06:40,051
Our spells met.

1163
02:06:41,594 --> 02:06:43,471
Let's call it fate.

1164
02:06:44,847 --> 02:06:48,226
After all, how else
will we fulfill our destinies?

1165
02:06:50,103 --> 02:06:51,354
Albus.

1166
02:06:53,147 --> 02:06:54,732
Promise me.

1167
02:06:57,026 --> 02:06:59,070
You'll find him and you'll stop him.

1168
02:07:26,848 --> 02:07:29,809
Albert,
don't forget the pierogis.

1169
02:07:29,892 --> 02:07:31,227
Yes, Mr. K.

1170
02:07:31,310 --> 02:07:32,937
Albert.

1171
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:35,106
No more than eight minutes
on the kolaczkis.

1172
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:37,233
Yes, Mr. K.

1173
02:07:37,316 --> 02:07:38,401
He's a sweet kid.

1174
02:07:38,484 --> 02:07:40,945
He doesn't know the difference
between paszteciki and golabki.

1175
02:07:41,028 --> 02:07:42,214
- Hey, sweetheart.
- What?

1176
02:07:42,238 --> 02:07:43,882
Newt doesn't know
what you're talking about.

1177
02:07:43,906 --> 02:07:45,384
I don't know what you're talking about.

1178
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:48,411
And you are not working today, remember?

1179
02:07:48,494 --> 02:07:49,787
Oh!

1180
02:07:49,871 --> 02:07:51,706
Oh, are you all right, honey?

1181
02:07:51,789 --> 02:07:53,809
Oh, you're nervous about the speech.
Don't be nervous.

1182
02:07:53,833 --> 02:07:54,876
Tell him, honey.

1183
02:07:54,959 --> 02:07:56,103
Don't be nervous about the speech.

1184
02:07:56,127 --> 02:07:57,003
I'm not nervous.

1185
02:07:57,086 --> 02:07:59,213
What is the smell?
Why is there burning?

1186
02:07:59,297 --> 02:08:00,715
Albert?

1187
02:08:02,842 --> 02:08:05,845
Mm. Maybe we're nervous
about something else, huh?

1188
02:08:06,554 --> 02:08:08,764
I can't imagine
what you're talking about.

1189
02:08:09,015 --> 02:08:10,016
Mm-hmm.

1190
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:25,198
So, the day that I first met Jacob...

1191
02:08:26,532 --> 02:08:27,783
The day that I first met Jacob,

1192
02:08:27,867 --> 02:08:30,161
we were both
sitting in the steen national bank.

1193
02:08:31,954 --> 02:08:33,206
Never would I...

1194
02:08:47,803 --> 02:08:49,722
The maid of honor, I presume?

1195
02:08:51,766 --> 02:08:54,060
The best man, I gather?

1196
02:08:55,937 --> 02:08:58,231
- You've done something to your hair.
- No.

1197
02:09:01,525 --> 02:09:03,778
Well, yes, actually, just...

1198
02:09:03,861 --> 02:09:04,904
Just for tonight.

1199
02:09:04,987 --> 02:09:06,614
- Well, it suits you.
- Thank you, newt.

1200
02:09:12,328 --> 02:09:13,568
- Hello.
- Hi.

1201
02:09:13,621 --> 02:09:14,747
Look who's...

1202
02:09:17,375 --> 02:09:19,252
So good to see you.

1203
02:09:19,335 --> 02:09:20,711
- Hi.
- How are you?

1204
02:09:20,795 --> 02:09:22,004
You look wonderful, lally.

1205
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:24,340
Well, thank you, newt. I appreciate it.

1206
02:09:24,423 --> 02:09:25,466
Good luck.

1207
02:09:25,549 --> 02:09:26,549
Tina, come on.

1208
02:09:26,592 --> 02:09:28,752
- You must tell me how macusa's been.
- See you inside.

1209
02:09:34,809 --> 02:09:36,686
What about me? How do I look?

1210
02:09:37,019 --> 02:09:38,521
- You all right?
- You look fine.

1211
02:09:38,604 --> 02:09:39,604
You okay?

1212
02:09:39,647 --> 02:09:40,648
Yeah, I'm all right.

1213
02:09:40,731 --> 02:09:42,066
You're not nervous, are you?

1214
02:09:43,442 --> 02:09:46,529
Can't be nervous about
a speech after saving the world. Hmm.

1215
02:10:03,587 --> 02:10:05,131
It's a historic day.

1216
02:10:06,507 --> 02:10:11,053
Where once was before,
there will now be after.

1217
02:10:13,973 --> 02:10:17,810
Funny how historic days seem so ordinary
when you're living them.

1218
02:10:18,894 --> 02:10:21,498
Well, perhaps that's what happens
when the world gets things right.

1219
02:10:21,522 --> 02:10:24,650
Mm, it's jolly nice to know
it happens occasionally.

1220
02:10:28,612 --> 02:10:30,573
I didn't know if I'd see you here.

1221
02:10:31,490 --> 02:10:33,075
I wasn't sure you would, either.

1222
02:10:33,159 --> 02:10:34,469
Hey, newt.

1223
02:10:34,493 --> 02:10:35,493
Yes.

1224
02:10:35,536 --> 02:10:37,496
Jacob seems to think he's lost the ring.

1225
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:38,748
Please tell me you've got it.

1226
02:10:38,831 --> 02:10:40,750
No, it's all good. Yep.

1227
02:10:40,833 --> 02:10:42,084
Whew!

1228
02:10:42,168 --> 02:10:43,888
That scared me. Jacob!

1229
02:10:46,589 --> 02:10:47,673
Good man, pick.

1230
02:10:52,970 --> 02:10:54,430
I should probably, um...

1231
02:10:56,098 --> 02:10:57,350
Thank you, newt.

1232
02:10:58,934 --> 02:11:00,102
What for?

1233
02:11:00,186 --> 02:11:01,687
Pick your poison.

1234
02:11:03,939 --> 02:11:06,484
I really
couldn't have done it without you.

1235
02:11:13,366 --> 02:11:15,785
I'd do it again, by the way.

1236
02:11:17,578 --> 02:11:19,121
Should you ask.

1237
02:11:34,470 --> 02:11:35,471
Okay.

1238
02:11:37,765 --> 02:11:38,766
Hey.

1239
02:11:49,652 --> 02:11:50,852
- Hey!
- Hello!

1240
02:11:51,028 --> 02:11:52,488
Bunty!

1241
02:11:53,322 --> 02:11:54,865
Bunty!

1242
02:12:14,718 --> 02:12:17,680
Wow, you're so beautiful.

1243
02:12:23,394 --> 02:12:24,603
Oh.

1244
02:12:25,312 --> 02:12:27,356
I can't believe it.

1245
02:12:48,085 --> 02:12:49,628
This is, um... This is Albert.

1246
02:12:49,712 --> 02:12:51,297
I don't know if you've met Albert, yet?

1247
02:12:51,380 --> 02:12:52,756
