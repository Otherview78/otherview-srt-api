1
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:18,893
The future has not been written.

2
00:01:19,102 --> 00:01:22,897
There is no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

3
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:40,498
I wish I could believe that.

4
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:46,212
My name is John Connor.

5
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:50,008
They tried to murder me before I was born.

6
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:54,387
When I was 13, they tried again.

7
00:01:54,596 --> 00:01:57,682
Machines from the future.

8
00:01:57,891 --> 00:02:00,477
Terminators.

9
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:05,190
All my life, my mother told me
the storm was coming.

10
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:07,609
- Judgment Day.
- Connor!

11
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:11,696
The beginning of a war
between man and machines.

12
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,410
Three billion lives
would vanish in an instant.

13
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:23,708
And I would lead what was left
of the human race to ultimate victory.

14
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:27,879
It hasn't happened.

15
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,507
No bombs fell.

16
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,177
Computers didn't take control.

17
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:38,515
We stopped Judgment Day.

18
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:43,812
I should feel safe...

19
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:46,898
...but I don't.

20
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:50,985
So I live off the grid.

21
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:55,698
No phone, no address.

22
00:02:55,907 --> 00:03:00,578
No one and nothing can find me.

23
00:03:00,787 --> 00:03:05,083
I've erased all connections to the past.

24
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:08,586
But as hard as I try...

25
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,006
...I can't erase my dreams...

26
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,009
...my nightmares.

27
00:04:26,998 --> 00:04:31,711
I feel the weight of the future
bearing down on me.

28
00:04:32,378 --> 00:04:34,380
A future I don't want.

29
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:38,218
So I keep running...

30
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:40,303
...as fast as I can.

31
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:44,015
Anywhere.

32
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:46,518
Nowhere.

33
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,207
Oh, my God.

34
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:34,292
Are you okay?

35
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:37,504
Do you want me to call 911?

36
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,717
I like this car.

37
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:45,887
What are you...?

38
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:52,287
You, in the silver Lexus. Slow down.

39
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:54,789
Slow down and pull over immediately.

40
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,700
Lady, have you any idea
how fast you were going?

41
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:32,911
Let me see your license and registration.

42
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:38,208
I like your gun.

43
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,502
What?

44
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:46,091
This stupid thing's not working.

45
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:49,511
What's wrong with this thing?

46
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:52,806
I hate machines.

47
00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:57,685
- Hello?
- Kate, it's your father.

48
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:01,189
You're blowing me off again.

49
00:09:01,481 --> 00:09:04,609
I'm so sorry. You know how much
I wanted to see you this weekend.

50
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:09,781
- But we're having computer problems...
- I know, you can't talk about it.

51
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:11,407
It's just...

52
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:14,494
...Scott was really looking forward to this.

53
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:19,707
Katie. I wish I had more time
to get to know him. I really do.

54
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:23,711
That's okay. You're bound
to run into him at the wedding.

55
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:27,090
Please. I'm still
in a state of denial about that.

56
00:09:27,882 --> 00:09:30,718
- You're not the only one.
- Hey, kiddo.

57
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:33,388
You don't need me
to pass judgment on this guy.

58
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:35,890
You've done the right thing
your whole life.

59
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:38,393
You won't make a mistake. You never do.

60
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:41,896
I'm the luckiest father
in the world, you know?

61
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:45,483
I've never had to be afraid
for my daughter.

62
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:49,487
Listen, I hate this. I gotta run.
Come see me. I promise I won't cancel.

63
00:09:49,696 --> 00:09:50,780
We will.

64
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:53,908
- Bye, Dad, I love you.
- Love you too.

65
00:10:06,921 --> 00:10:10,508
- Okay, what have we got?
- This new computer virus is tricky.

66
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,387
It's infected half the civilian Internet
as well as secondary military apps.

67
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:17,307
- Payroll, inventory.
- Primary defense nets are still clean?

68
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,809
So far the firewalls are holding up.

69
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:23,688
Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we use
our Al to scan the infrastructure.

70
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:26,316
Search and destroy
for any hint of the virus.

71
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:29,819
I know, Tony, but that's like
going after a fly with a bazooka.

72
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:32,614
Once the connection's made,
it should only be a few minutes.

73
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:37,202
During which we've put everything under
the control of a single computer system.

74
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,121
The most intelligent system
ever conceived.

75
00:10:40,288 --> 00:10:43,291
I still prefer to keep humans in the loop.

76
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,585
I'm not sure Skynet's ready.

77
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:47,712
Yes, sir.

78
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:23,183
Thanks.

79
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:36,089
You're supposed to go around
to the back.

80
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,222
Hey, I said you're supposed to go...

81
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:23,803
- Take off your clothes.
- Patience, honey.

82
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,812
Bitch. Wait your turn.

83
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:36,024
- Your clothes.
- Talk to the hand.

84
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,487
Now.

85
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,110
Welcome to Jim's Burgers.
Can I take your order?

86
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:06,114
- Jose Barrera?
- Yeah, that's me.

87
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:28,303
Growing concern over widespread outages
in the global digital network...

88
00:16:28,595 --> 00:16:31,890
...have prompted rumors
of a new computer super-virus.

89
00:16:32,098 --> 00:16:35,685
- Wall Street analysts are confident...
- Shit! My mom's home.

90
00:16:36,102 --> 00:16:38,897
Here. Hide the beer. Hide the beer.
Here. Take that.

91
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:42,025
Go, go, go.

92
00:16:47,113 --> 00:16:50,617
Elizabeth and William Anderson?

93
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:55,705
I'm Bill. My sister's upstairs.
Is there something wrong?

94
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:10,386
What's going on?

95
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:13,723
I have to go to the clinic.
It's an emergency.

96
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,101
It's 4:30 in the morning.

97
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:20,021
Well, I'll be back before you get up.

98
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:06,025
Cool it, guys, it's just me.

99
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:09,487
We've got a sick cat coming in.

100
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:32,594
Great.

101
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:35,221
Junkies.

102
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,395
Please, don't do that.

103
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:48,693
I suppose it was you who
ripped us off last week.

104
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:51,696
Put the phone down.

105
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:54,824
Sorry.

106
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:56,618
I just...

107
00:18:56,826 --> 00:18:58,912
I needed some medicine.

108
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,707
There's an emergency clinic
half a mile away.

109
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,417
Can't do that.

110
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:11,925
How much did you take?

111
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:13,885
- Enough.
- Well...

112
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:17,722
...this is the stuff we use
to chemically neuter dogs.

113
00:19:20,517 --> 00:19:22,018
Take a look.

114
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,313
Hey!

115
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:32,987
Jesus! You didn't have to do that!

116
00:19:33,905 --> 00:19:36,324
Next time bring a clue,
not a paintball gun.

117
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:39,994
- No, this isn't what you think.
- Yeah, right.

118
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:03,017
It's Hercules. I think he's got pneumonia.
He started coughing and wouldn't stop.

119
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:07,689
- Betsy, I've got a problem in the back.
- A problem? This is an emergency!

120
00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:11,401
- It sounds like a hairball.
- I know what a hairball sounds like.

121
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:14,821
- Where's Dr. Monroe?
- It's 5:30 in the morning.

122
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:18,199
I'm sure he's home sleeping.
He'll come in if he has to.

123
00:20:18,992 --> 00:20:23,705
Just wait in here with Hercules
and I'll be a few minutes, all right?

124
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:43,725
Mike Kripke's basement.

125
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:47,187
What? What does that mean?

126
00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:01,326
You're John connor.

127
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:09,125
I'm Kate Brewster.

128
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:14,589
We went to
West Hills Junior High together.

129
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:22,305
- Jesus.
- What happened to you, John?

130
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:26,518
Middle of eighth grade,
you just disappeared.

131
00:21:26,726 --> 00:21:30,021
And there was that thing
about your foster parents.

132
00:21:30,313 --> 00:21:32,899
Yeah, they were murdered.

133
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:37,403
I didn't do it.

134
00:21:38,822 --> 00:21:40,907
What the hell?

135
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:43,701
Is somebody with you?

136
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:07,600
Katherine Brewster?

137
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:25,827
No.

138
00:24:15,603 --> 00:24:18,690
John connor was here.
Where did he go?

139
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:22,193
Tell me. Where did he go?

140
00:25:02,025 --> 00:25:03,401
Katherine Brewster?

141
00:25:08,198 --> 00:25:10,700
What are you doing? Let me down!

142
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:14,204
Let me down! Let me down!

143
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:19,000
Where is John connor?

144
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:22,003
If I tell you, will you let me go?

145
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:24,297
Yes.

146
00:25:24,506 --> 00:25:26,800
He's...

147
00:25:27,008 --> 00:25:30,220
...in the kennel, in a cage.

148
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,017
You said that you'd let me go.

149
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:37,811
I lied.

150
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:43,399
Please, please, please.
You have to let me go!

151
00:26:31,197 --> 00:26:34,200
John connor.

152
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,496
It is time.

153
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:42,208
You here to kill me?

154
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:51,092
No. You must live.

155
00:27:01,895 --> 00:27:05,690
- Why are you here? Where are we going?
- Keep moving.

156
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,820
Get out of here.

157
00:27:11,905 --> 00:27:13,615
Now!

158
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,916
- No pulse.
- See if you can get him down.

159
00:28:06,626 --> 00:28:08,503
I can't.

160
00:28:08,628 --> 00:28:10,713
This guy weighs a ton.

161
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:38,408
- 911.
- Yes. Yes. I'm being kidnapped.

162
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:42,120
- Where are you now?
- I don't know where. I'm in my truck.

163
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:44,831
It's a Toyota Tundra.

164
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:50,420
It says "Emery Animal Hospital"
on the side. I'm locked inside the back.

165
00:28:51,504 --> 00:28:52,797
Hello?

166
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:56,009
Hello?

167
00:28:58,511 --> 00:29:00,722
Shit! Shit!

168
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:16,297
Get off.

169
00:30:32,522 --> 00:30:33,523
Let me out!

170
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,316
What are you doing here?

171
00:30:35,525 --> 00:30:38,027
You tell me. You got me into this.

172
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:40,697
- Stop the car.
- I can't. Not yet.

173
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:44,909
- You bastard! Stop the car!
- Shut up!

174
00:30:56,504 --> 00:30:58,923
Son of a bitch.

175
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:01,509
Goddamn it.

176
00:31:01,718 --> 00:31:03,720
Look what you did to my car.

177
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:07,223
This is my company car, asshole.

178
00:31:07,307 --> 00:31:08,892
Get your ass out here.

179
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:11,227
Get your ass out of the car. Now!

180
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,313
What are you doing?

181
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,608
If you don't have insurance,
I'm gonna rip your balls off.

182
00:31:16,816 --> 00:31:19,027
- I don't want any problems, okay?
- Shut up!

183
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,320
Help!

184
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,697
Who's talking back there?
What's going on?

185
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:24,115
- Calm down.
- Shut up!

186
00:31:24,324 --> 00:31:27,994
- I'm being kidnapped! Call the police!
- Well, I'll be goddamned.

187
00:31:28,203 --> 00:31:30,121
- Call 911!
- A cop when you need one.

188
00:31:30,205 --> 00:31:32,123
Help, please! Please!

189
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:35,126
Let me out of here! Help!

190
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:40,507
Get back here, asshole!

191
00:32:03,196 --> 00:32:05,406
That's the cops!
You have to pull over!

192
00:32:05,615 --> 00:32:07,200
Yeah, first chance I get.

193
00:33:12,932 --> 00:33:14,309
Hold on!

194
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:26,423
Stop it!

195
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:33,531
I'll drive.

196
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:41,915
Get out.

197
00:36:38,513 --> 00:36:40,598
Excuse me.

198
00:37:24,934 --> 00:37:26,227
Move over.

199
00:37:56,216 --> 00:37:58,635
No sign of brain trauma.

200
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,597
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

201
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:09,395
Do you even remember me?

202
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:14,025
Sarah connor? Blowing up cyberdyne?

203
00:38:14,317 --> 00:38:17,612
"Hasta la vista, baby."
Ring any bells?

204
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:20,323
That was a different T-101.

205
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,118
What, do you come off an assembly line
or something?

206
00:38:23,326 --> 00:38:24,536
Exactly.

207
00:38:25,412 --> 00:38:28,706
Oh, man. I'm gonna have
to teach you everything all over again.

208
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:33,711
Katherine Brewster,
have you sustained injury?

209
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:36,506
Drop dead, you asshole!

210
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:40,301
I'm unable to comply.

211
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:51,312
Where are you taking me?

212
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:53,606
To a safe location.

213
00:39:10,206 --> 00:39:12,834
All right, get off at the next exit.
Let her out.

214
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:16,212
Negative.
Katherine Brewster must be protected.

215
00:39:16,713 --> 00:39:20,008
- I thought I was the one they were after.
- You could not be located.

216
00:39:20,216 --> 00:39:24,721
So a T-X was sent back through time
to eliminate your lieutenants.

217
00:39:25,722 --> 00:39:29,601
So she's gonna be in the Resistance?

218
00:39:32,812 --> 00:39:36,024
No, no.
No, you shouldn't even exist.

219
00:39:36,232 --> 00:39:38,735
I mean,
we took out cyberdyne over 10 years ago.

220
00:39:38,902 --> 00:39:42,697
- We stopped Judgment Day.
- You only postponed it.

221
00:39:42,906 --> 00:39:45,116
Judgment Day is inevitable.

222
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:54,626
I require a cutting tool.

223
00:40:01,508 --> 00:40:03,802
Here, take the wheel.

224
00:40:07,097 --> 00:40:10,600
- What are you doing?
- I am powered by two hydrogen fuel cells.

225
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:14,104
My primary cell was damaged
by a plasma attack.

226
00:40:14,437 --> 00:40:18,399
T-X is designed for extreme combat,
driven by a plasma reactor...

227
00:40:18,608 --> 00:40:20,610
...and equipped with onboard weapons.

228
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:22,112
Its arsenal includes...

229
00:40:22,237 --> 00:40:24,823
...nanotechnological transjectors.

230
00:40:25,031 --> 00:40:28,827
- Meaning?
- It can control other machines.

231
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:36,000
Its body chassis is heavily armored
and hardened to withstand external attack.

232
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,296
- You'll find a way to destroy her.
- Unlikely.

233
00:40:40,797 --> 00:40:42,715
I'm an obsolete design.

234
00:40:42,924 --> 00:40:47,220
T-X is faster, more powerful
and more intelligent.

235
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:50,306
It's a far more effective
killing machine.

236
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:52,308
Oh, great.

237
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:53,810
That's great.

238
00:40:55,311 --> 00:40:58,022
My presence in this timeline
has been anticipated.

239
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:02,610
T-X is designed to terminate
other cybernetic organisms.

240
00:41:02,735 --> 00:41:07,824
So she's an anti-Terminator
Terminator?

241
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,910
You've gotta be shitting me.

242
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,497
No, I am not shitting you.

243
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:34,017
When ruptured,
the fuel cells become unstable.

244
00:41:34,517 --> 00:41:35,810
Relax.

245
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:39,522
- Let me out of here!
- Relax!

246
00:42:00,502 --> 00:42:01,920
Man, this is wack.

247
00:42:02,128 --> 00:42:05,298
It's been like this for hours.
Every goddamn station.

248
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:28,613
Hey.

249
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,616
Hey! Are you gonna pay for that?

250
00:42:35,912 --> 00:42:37,705
Talk to the hand.

251
00:42:54,222 --> 00:42:57,016
Help! Help me!

252
00:42:57,517 --> 00:42:59,102
Help!

253
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:04,899
I think we better go.

254
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:38,600
Jerky?

255
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:41,728
You're kidnapping me.

256
00:43:42,729 --> 00:43:45,023
- Look...
- God, you were always a delinquent.

257
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:49,110
And look at you now, sitting there
like the bad boy thing still works.

258
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:52,238
What are you,
some kind of gang member?

259
00:43:52,322 --> 00:43:54,699
How do you live with yourself?

260
00:43:57,035 --> 00:43:58,536
What?

261
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:04,626
Tell her who I am.

262
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:10,507
John Connor is leader of the Worldwide
Resistance and last hope of humankind.

263
00:44:12,008 --> 00:44:14,511
Right. And him?

264
00:44:15,512 --> 00:44:17,931
He's a robot from the future.

265
00:44:18,014 --> 00:44:21,726
Living tissue over a metal skeleton,
sent back in time to protect me.

266
00:44:21,935 --> 00:44:23,728
Go to hell.

267
00:44:24,437 --> 00:44:27,023
He doesn't mean you any harm.

268
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:30,318
I have a fiancé.

269
00:44:30,527 --> 00:44:32,612
He's gonna be looking for me.

270
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:35,240
What is it that you want?

271
00:44:37,033 --> 00:44:38,535
Just...

272
00:44:39,327 --> 00:44:41,121
...imagine...

273
00:44:42,622 --> 00:44:46,709
...if you knew you were gonna do
something important with your life.

274
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:49,212
Something amazing.

275
00:44:49,629 --> 00:44:53,216
Maybe the most important thing
anyone has ever done.

276
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:55,510
But there's a catch.

277
00:44:56,428 --> 00:44:59,139
Something terrible has to happen.

278
00:45:03,518 --> 00:45:05,937
You couldn't...

279
00:45:06,438 --> 00:45:10,316
...live with yourself if you didn't try
to stop it, but...

280
00:45:10,525 --> 00:45:12,110
What are you talking about?

281
00:45:14,737 --> 00:45:18,032
It's just... The life you know...

282
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:21,202
...all the stuff that
you take for granted...

283
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:23,621
...it's not gonna last.

284
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,838
Mike Kripke.

285
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:35,633
Back there, why did you say
"Kripke's basement"?

286
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,427
Because Mike Kripke's house...

287
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:40,930
...that's where the kids used
to go make out, right?

288
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:48,438
So you and me...
Wait, did we...?

289
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:52,317
Holy shit, we did.

290
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,113
We made out in Kripke's basement.
I cannot believe you remembered that.

291
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:02,535
I must have made
some kind of impression.

292
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:04,037
Give me a break.

293
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:07,707
I only remembered because
the next day you were in the news.

294
00:46:13,129 --> 00:46:18,009
Wait a second. You and me hooked up
the day before I first met him.

295
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,138
And now again, 10 years later.

296
00:46:23,932 --> 00:46:26,518
We were supposed to meet.

297
00:46:27,727 --> 00:46:29,813
Coincidence.

298
00:46:34,818 --> 00:46:36,528
Yeah.

299
00:47:02,011 --> 00:47:04,931
Hon? Did you just get in?

300
00:47:24,117 --> 00:47:27,412
Hi, I'm Detective Edwards, L.A.P.D.
This is Detective Bell.

301
00:47:28,121 --> 00:47:30,707
We're looking for Katherine Brewster.
Is she here?

302
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:32,125
No.

303
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:36,713
- You're her fiancé, Scott Mason?
- Yes.

304
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:40,717
There was an incident at the
veterinary hospital where she works.

305
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:43,636
We're concerned something
may have happened to her.

306
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,929
Where is she?

307
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:48,516
We got a report from a gas station
attendant near victorville...

308
00:47:48,725 --> 00:47:52,604
...about a possible kidnapping
and it might be related.

309
00:47:52,812 --> 00:47:55,106
I'll help you find her.

310
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:08,828
Come with me.

311
00:48:13,416 --> 00:48:14,918
Go.

312
00:48:42,821 --> 00:48:44,531
Your mother?

313
00:48:47,033 --> 00:48:49,911
I never even knew
where she was buried.

314
00:48:52,831 --> 00:48:55,708
I hit the road the day she died.

315
00:48:59,629 --> 00:49:01,923
Why did you bring me here?

316
00:49:05,927 --> 00:49:07,303
No! What are you doing?

317
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:09,013
Hey, stop!

318
00:49:09,305 --> 00:49:10,640
Get away from it! Stop!

319
00:49:18,314 --> 00:49:20,817
Sarah connor was cremated in Mexico.

320
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:23,319
Her friends scattered her ashes
in the sea.

321
00:49:23,736 --> 00:49:26,906
They stored these weapons
in accordance with her will.

322
00:49:28,408 --> 00:49:29,909
What happened to her?

323
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:33,413
Leukemia.

324
00:49:36,332 --> 00:49:38,209
I'm sorry.

325
00:49:39,919 --> 00:49:43,423
We were living in Baja
when she was diagnosed.

326
00:49:45,008 --> 00:49:47,719
They only gave her six months.

327
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,806
But she fought for three years.

328
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:56,519
Long enough to make sure.

329
00:49:58,438 --> 00:50:00,523
To make sure?

330
00:50:03,026 --> 00:50:05,528
That the world didn't end.

331
00:50:11,826 --> 00:50:13,828
"Every day after this one is a gift."

332
00:50:14,037 --> 00:50:16,915
She told me, "We made it. We're free."

333
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:22,337
But I never really believed that.

334
00:50:25,423 --> 00:50:27,842
I guess she didn't either.

335
00:50:29,636 --> 00:50:33,306
You know you were about
the closest thing to a father I ever had?

336
00:50:34,432 --> 00:50:36,226
How pathetic is that?

337
00:50:37,811 --> 00:50:39,020
Out of my way!

338
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,442
My mission is to protect you.

339
00:50:45,318 --> 00:50:46,528
That's enough.

340
00:50:48,113 --> 00:50:51,616
Move or I'll do it!
I swear I will! I'll shoot you!

341
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:54,911
Go ahead. See what happens.

342
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:11,302
Don't do that.

343
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:15,432
Oh, my God.

344
00:51:21,604 --> 00:51:24,941
This is the police.
We have the building surrounded.

345
00:51:25,108 --> 00:51:27,318
Release your hostage!

346
00:51:46,212 --> 00:51:49,924
Just leave me here. I'm not the one
you want. You're wasting your time.

347
00:51:50,133 --> 00:51:54,137
Incorrect. John connor
leads the Resistance to victory.

348
00:51:54,304 --> 00:51:55,638
How?

349
00:51:55,805 --> 00:51:57,432
Why? Why me?

350
00:51:57,807 --> 00:51:59,809
You are John connor.

351
00:52:00,226 --> 00:52:04,439
Christ, my mom fed me that bullshit
since the cradle.

352
00:52:04,814 --> 00:52:07,525
Look at me.
I'm no leader, I never was!

353
00:52:07,734 --> 00:52:09,819
I'm never gonna...

354
00:52:13,823 --> 00:52:15,241
Let go.

355
00:52:15,617 --> 00:52:18,536
You're right.
You're not the one I want.

356
00:52:18,828 --> 00:52:21,122
I'm wasting my time.

357
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:27,420
Fuck you, you fucking machine!

358
00:52:28,338 --> 00:52:29,839
Better.

359
00:52:32,008 --> 00:52:34,135
Oh, you were just dicking with me?

360
00:52:34,219 --> 00:52:37,013
Anger is more useful than despair.

361
00:52:37,138 --> 00:52:38,723
What?

362
00:52:38,932 --> 00:52:42,310
Basic psychology is among
my subroutines.

363
00:52:46,606 --> 00:52:48,733
Perps still holed up?

364
00:52:49,818 --> 00:52:50,944
Gotcha.

365
00:52:51,027 --> 00:52:53,613
Good news. Your fiancée's okay.

366
00:52:53,822 --> 00:52:54,823
Where is she?

367
00:52:55,031 --> 00:52:57,534
Greenlawn cemetery,
up off the 5 freeway.

368
00:52:57,742 --> 00:53:01,704
It's right by the desert.
But they're gonna bring her back to the...

369
00:53:02,622 --> 00:53:05,125
oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God!

370
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:38,908
You're safe now. They can't hurt you.

371
00:53:39,534 --> 00:53:42,704
Kate, my name is Dr. Silberman.

372
00:53:42,829 --> 00:53:46,207
I'm a post-trauma counselor
for the sheriff's department.

373
00:53:46,332 --> 00:53:48,418
How are you feeling?

374
00:53:49,127 --> 00:53:51,129
He's not human.

375
00:53:51,504 --> 00:53:55,633
He's really not human.

376
00:53:58,136 --> 00:54:01,514
I know what it's like to be
in a hostage situation.

377
00:54:01,723 --> 00:54:03,808
I've been there myself.

378
00:54:04,017 --> 00:54:07,145
The fear, the adrenaline.

379
00:54:07,312 --> 00:54:11,232
You find yourself imagining things.

380
00:54:11,733 --> 00:54:14,319
Impossible things.

381
00:54:15,028 --> 00:54:17,238
Crazy things.

382
00:54:18,406 --> 00:54:20,742
Insane things.

383
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:25,538
Take years to get over it.

384
00:54:26,706 --> 00:54:29,209
- Go, go, go!
- Move it!

385
00:54:34,923 --> 00:54:36,216
Drop your weapon!

386
00:54:39,928 --> 00:54:42,013
And the coffin!

387
00:54:44,307 --> 00:54:46,810
Take him down! Take him down!

388
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:29,811
Resume fire!

389
00:55:36,818 --> 00:55:39,237
We must reacquire Katherine Brewster.

390
00:55:40,029 --> 00:55:42,907
Why? What makes her
so goddamn important?

391
00:55:43,116 --> 00:55:47,412
Through her, you contact remnants of the
military and learn how to fight Skynet...

392
00:55:47,746 --> 00:55:50,123
...forming the core
of the Resistance.

393
00:55:50,331 --> 00:55:52,917
Later,
your children will become important.

394
00:55:53,835 --> 00:55:56,838
- What?
- She's your wife.

395
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:57,440
Get in!

396
00:56:57,607 --> 00:56:59,109
Do you want to live? Come on!

397
00:57:21,506 --> 00:57:24,843
- It was Scott! How could it be Scott?
- Your fiancé?

398
00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:29,013
The T-X is polymimetic, able to
take the form of anything it touches.

399
00:57:29,806 --> 00:57:31,808
Your fiancé is dead.

400
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,221
Oh, my God!

401
00:58:02,935 --> 00:58:04,019
Do something!

402
00:58:35,133 --> 00:58:36,844
Get down.

403
00:58:59,324 --> 00:59:01,535
We need a new vehicle.

404
01:00:24,535 --> 01:00:26,036
Hey, come on.

405
01:00:26,245 --> 01:00:28,330
We gotta keep moving.

406
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:33,043
She killed Scott because of me.

407
01:00:39,842 --> 01:00:42,135
Look, I know this won't help...

408
01:00:44,346 --> 01:00:49,935
...but sometimes things happen
that we just can't change.

409
01:00:53,939 --> 01:00:55,440
It's not your fault.

410
01:01:10,831 --> 01:01:13,125
Are you sure about this?

411
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:15,335
About her and me, I mean.

412
01:01:15,544 --> 01:01:20,132
Your confusion is not rational.
She's a healthy female of breeding age.

413
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:22,217
There's more to it than that.

414
01:01:22,342 --> 01:01:27,014
My database does not encompass
the dynamics of human pair bonding.

415
01:01:30,517 --> 01:01:34,229
So this Terminatrix, how many others
does she have on her hit list?

416
01:01:34,646 --> 01:01:39,318
Twenty-two. Anderson, Elizabeth.
Anderson, William.

417
01:01:39,443 --> 01:01:42,237
Barrera, Jose. Brewster, Robert.

418
01:01:42,446 --> 01:01:43,614
My father?

419
01:01:43,822 --> 01:01:48,827
Having failed to acquire its primary target,
T-X will resume its default program.

420
01:01:49,036 --> 01:01:53,123
- She's gonna kill my father too?
- There's a high probability.

421
01:01:53,832 --> 01:01:56,251
- No.
- Who is he? What does he do?

422
01:01:56,418 --> 01:02:00,839
He's in the Air Force. Weapon design,
secret stuff. I don't know, exactly.

423
01:02:01,048 --> 01:02:04,843
General Robert Brewster
is program director of cRS...

424
01:02:05,052 --> 01:02:08,931
...cyber Research Systems,
autonomous weapons division.

425
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:12,017
Skynet. You're talking about Skynet.

426
01:02:12,142 --> 01:02:16,438
Skynet is one of the digital defense systems
developed under Brewster.

427
01:02:16,647 --> 01:02:18,148
Oh, God.

428
01:02:18,524 --> 01:02:21,735
Oh, my God. Of course.

429
01:02:22,152 --> 01:02:23,654
It all makes sense now.

430
01:02:24,446 --> 01:02:27,825
If you hadn't come back when I was a kid,
changed everything...

431
01:02:28,033 --> 01:02:32,120
...she and I would have gotten together
then. I would have met her father.

432
01:02:32,538 --> 01:02:34,915
- Don't you see?
- I don't understand.

433
01:02:35,123 --> 01:02:39,044
Your father.
This is all about your father.

434
01:02:39,253 --> 01:02:43,841
He's the key. He always was. Your father
is the one who can shut Skynet down.

435
01:02:45,217 --> 01:02:47,719
He's the only one who ever could.

436
01:02:49,638 --> 01:02:51,723
We have to get to him
before the T-X does.

437
01:02:51,932 --> 01:02:56,436
- Negative. I cannot jeopardize my mission.
- This is your mission, to save people!

438
01:02:56,645 --> 01:03:00,524
My mission is to ensure the survival
of John connor and Katherine Brewster.

439
01:03:01,316 --> 01:03:03,652
I am giving you an order.

440
01:03:03,819 --> 01:03:06,446
I am not programmed
to follow your orders.

441
01:03:06,613 --> 01:03:09,616
- After the nuclear war, you both...
- Nuclear war?!

442
01:03:09,825 --> 01:03:12,953
There doesn't have to be a war!
We can stop it!

443
01:03:13,036 --> 01:03:15,247
There is insufficient time.

444
01:03:15,414 --> 01:03:19,626
The first launch sequences
will be initiated at 6:18 p.m.

445
01:03:19,751 --> 01:03:21,545
- What, today?
- Affirmative.

446
01:03:21,753 --> 01:03:24,423
John, what is he saying?

447
01:03:25,549 --> 01:03:27,551
Judgment Day.

448
01:03:28,927 --> 01:03:31,138
The end of the world.

449
01:03:32,431 --> 01:03:34,433
It's today, three hours from now.

450
01:03:34,933 --> 01:03:36,935
Two hours and 53 minutes.

451
01:03:37,144 --> 01:03:42,149
We must continue south into Mexico
to escape the primary blast zones.

452
01:03:42,941 --> 01:03:45,736
No, we have to get to her dad.

453
01:03:47,446 --> 01:03:51,325
The Mojave area will sustain
significant nuclear fallout.

454
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,118
You will not survive.

455
01:03:53,952 --> 01:03:58,248
You mean we go run and hide somewhere
in a hole while the bombs fall?

456
01:03:59,124 --> 01:04:00,542
It is your destiny.

457
01:04:04,254 --> 01:04:06,048
- Fuck my destiny.
- John.

458
01:04:11,053 --> 01:04:12,846
You cannot self-terminate.

459
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:15,849
No, you can't.
I can do whatever I want.

460
01:04:16,016 --> 01:04:18,852
I'm a human being.
I'm not some goddamn robot.

461
01:04:19,019 --> 01:04:20,854
- Cybernetic organism.
- Whatever!

462
01:04:20,938 --> 01:04:23,815
Either we get her father
to shut Skynet down...

463
01:04:24,024 --> 01:04:28,737
...stop this shit from ever happening,
or so much for the great John connor.

464
01:04:29,446 --> 01:04:33,951
Because your future, my destiny,
I don't want any part of it. I never did.

465
01:04:35,452 --> 01:04:39,248
Based on your pupil dilation,
skin temperature and motor functions...

466
01:04:39,832 --> 01:04:45,629
...I calculate an 83%% probability
that you will not pull the trigger.

467
01:04:49,842 --> 01:04:54,137
Please do what he says.
You have to save my father!

468
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:01,937
We can reach cRS
in approximately one hour...

469
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:04,815
...depending on traffic conditions.

470
01:05:29,214 --> 01:05:30,841
I can't get a line.

471
01:05:33,927 --> 01:05:35,721
The whole cell network is down.

472
01:05:35,929 --> 01:05:38,849
Skynet is assuming control
over global communications...

473
01:05:39,016 --> 01:05:41,351
...in preparation for its attack.

474
01:05:41,518 --> 01:05:45,731
So if this war is between people
and machines...

475
01:05:46,023 --> 01:05:48,233
...why are you on our side?

476
01:05:48,442 --> 01:05:52,321
The Resistance captured me
and reprogrammed my cPU.

477
01:05:52,529 --> 01:05:56,033
I was originally designed
for assassination missions.

478
01:05:58,952 --> 01:06:00,454
So...

479
01:06:00,829 --> 01:06:04,750
...you don't really care
if this mission succeeds or not.

480
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:09,254
If we get killed,
does that mean anything to you?

481
01:06:09,421 --> 01:06:12,633
If you were to die,
I will become useless.

482
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:15,928
There will be no reason for me to exist.

483
01:06:21,642 --> 01:06:23,644
Thank you for doing this.

484
01:06:23,852 --> 01:06:25,854
Your gratitude is not required.

485
01:06:26,522 --> 01:06:28,941
I am programmed
to follow your commands.

486
01:06:29,942 --> 01:06:31,318
Her commands?

487
01:06:31,527 --> 01:06:36,949
Katherine Brewster had me reactivated and
sent through the time displacement field.

488
01:06:37,032 --> 01:06:40,744
What exactly am I in this
future of yours?

489
01:06:40,828 --> 01:06:44,540
You're John connor's spouse
and second-in-command.

490
01:06:46,542 --> 01:06:48,418
No, l...

491
01:06:49,336 --> 01:06:50,337
What?

492
01:06:52,548 --> 01:06:54,216
You're a mess.

493
01:06:55,843 --> 01:06:59,638
Hey, you're not exactly my type, either.

494
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:02,641
Why didn't I send you back?

495
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:05,143
I am not authorized
to answer your question.

496
01:07:06,854 --> 01:07:10,315
- Why didn't he send you back?
- He was dead.

497
01:07:14,945 --> 01:07:16,655
Well, that sucks.

498
01:07:17,531 --> 01:07:21,451
- Humans inevitably die.
- Yeah, I know.

499
01:07:22,327 --> 01:07:24,538
So how does it...? No.

500
01:07:24,955 --> 01:07:27,749
Maybe I don't want to know.

501
01:07:29,334 --> 01:07:30,836
How does he die?

502
01:07:31,545 --> 01:07:35,340
John connor was terminated
on July 4th, 2032.

503
01:07:35,549 --> 01:07:39,428
I was selected for the emotional attachment
he had for my model number...

504
01:07:39,553 --> 01:07:43,849
...due to his boyhood experiences.
This aided in my infiltration.

505
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:46,435
What are you saying?

506
01:07:48,228 --> 01:07:50,522
I killed you.

507
01:08:02,826 --> 01:08:07,831
This has to be a mistake. As of 1100 hours,
all primary military systems were secure.

508
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:12,044
They were. Only the civilian sector
was affected. Internet, air traffic.

509
01:08:12,252 --> 01:08:15,047
Minutes ago, guidance computers
at vandenberg crashed.

510
01:08:15,255 --> 01:08:17,925
We thought it was an error.
It looks like the virus.

511
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:22,346
- Early warning in Alaska is down.
- Satellite signals are scrambled.

512
01:08:22,554 --> 01:08:25,349
What about the missile silos, the subs?

513
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:28,644
We've lost contact.

514
01:08:29,019 --> 01:08:32,523
You're saying this country
is completely open to attack.

515
01:08:32,648 --> 01:08:35,526
Theoretically, we could be
under attack already.

516
01:08:35,651 --> 01:08:41,156
Who's doing this? A foreign power
or some computer hacker in his garage?

517
01:08:41,323 --> 01:08:43,450
We can't trace the virus
or pin it down.

518
01:08:43,617 --> 01:08:47,746
It keeps growing and changing,
like it has a mind of its own.

519
01:08:48,247 --> 01:08:50,040
This can't be happening.

520
01:08:50,249 --> 01:08:54,419
The Pentagon's on the secure line.
It's the chairman.

521
01:08:57,631 --> 01:08:59,550
All right.

522
01:09:14,022 --> 01:09:15,941
Look...

523
01:09:16,316 --> 01:09:18,235
...none of this is gonna happen.

524
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:24,241
We get to your dad, get him to pull the plug
on Skynet. The bombs won't fall.

525
01:09:26,618 --> 01:09:29,454
He won't have to kill me someday.

526
01:09:30,247 --> 01:09:32,541
He'll never even exist.

527
01:09:34,251 --> 01:09:39,548
You and I, we can
just go our separate ways.

528
01:09:44,344 --> 01:09:46,847
You know, Mike Kripke's basement...

529
01:09:49,641 --> 01:09:52,519
That was the first time
I ever kissed a guy.

530
01:09:53,854 --> 01:09:55,147
Really?

531
01:10:02,321 --> 01:10:04,531
Your levity is good.

532
01:10:05,157 --> 01:10:08,619
It relieves tension and the fear of death.

533
01:10:35,729 --> 01:10:38,440
We're hoping you have a solution for us.

534
01:10:38,524 --> 01:10:42,319
I know, sir, but Skynet is not ready
for a system-wide connection.

535
01:10:42,528 --> 01:10:45,447
That's not what your civilian
counterparts there told me.

536
01:10:45,656 --> 01:10:47,950
They say we can stop this damn virus.

537
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:51,620
I understand there's a certain amount
of performance anxiety...

538
01:10:51,829 --> 01:10:55,123
...but your boys say if we plug Skynet
into all of our systems...

539
01:10:55,332 --> 01:10:59,336
...it'll squash this thing and give me back
control of my military.

540
01:10:59,545 --> 01:11:02,047
Mr. Chairman, I need
to make myself very clear.

541
01:11:02,256 --> 01:11:05,634
If we uplink now, Skynet will be
in control of your military.

542
01:11:05,843 --> 01:11:09,847
But you'll be in control of Skynet, right?

543
01:11:10,138 --> 01:11:12,349
That is correct, sir.

544
01:11:12,432 --> 01:11:13,851
Then do it.

545
01:11:14,017 --> 01:11:16,728
And Brewster, if this thing works...

546
01:11:16,937 --> 01:11:20,357
...you'll get all the funding
you'll ever need.

547
01:11:21,233 --> 01:11:23,151
Yes, sir.

548
01:12:31,845 --> 01:12:33,430
Sir?

549
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,433
Shall I?

550
01:12:37,935 --> 01:12:39,520
No.

551
01:12:40,646 --> 01:12:42,856
It's my job now.

552
01:12:57,329 --> 01:13:00,332
- Skynet Defense System activated.
- We're in.

553
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:03,752
We're past the firewalls, local
defense nets, Minutemen, subs.

554
01:13:03,919 --> 01:13:08,048
Skynet's fully operational,
processing at 60 teraflops a second.

555
01:13:08,257 --> 01:13:12,135
It should take less than a minute
to find the virus and kill it.

556
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:16,056
Let's pray to God this works.

557
01:13:22,354 --> 01:13:23,438
Power failure?

558
01:13:23,647 --> 01:13:25,941
No. I don't know what it is.

559
01:13:37,035 --> 01:13:39,454
What the hell is going on?

560
01:13:39,621 --> 01:13:40,622
Daddy!

561
01:13:41,248 --> 01:13:42,749
What are you doing here?

562
01:13:49,131 --> 01:13:51,925
Daddy! Get away from it!

563
01:13:55,721 --> 01:13:57,222
Watch out!

564
01:14:14,531 --> 01:14:16,450
Daddy, don't move.

565
01:14:20,746 --> 01:14:22,539
She'll be back.

566
01:14:23,123 --> 01:14:25,125
We have to shut down Skynet.

567
01:14:25,334 --> 01:14:27,920
Where's the system core?
In this building?

568
01:14:28,128 --> 01:14:31,924
Skynet. The virus has infected Skynet.

569
01:14:32,049 --> 01:14:35,260
Skynet is the virus!
It's why everything's falling apart!

570
01:14:35,344 --> 01:14:37,554
Skynet has become self-aware.

571
01:14:37,638 --> 01:14:41,350
In one hour it will initiate
a massive nuclear attack on its enemy.

572
01:14:41,433 --> 01:14:42,559
What enemy?

573
01:14:43,143 --> 01:14:44,520
Us!

574
01:14:44,728 --> 01:14:46,021
Humans.

575
01:14:55,239 --> 01:14:58,450
Oh, God! It's the machines.
They're starting to take over.

576
01:14:58,659 --> 01:15:02,120
My office, on this floor,
we have to get there.

577
01:15:03,247 --> 01:15:05,541
The access codes are in my safe.

578
01:16:24,328 --> 01:16:28,457
- Why are they killing everyone?
- To destroy any possible threat to Skynet.

579
01:16:28,624 --> 01:16:30,334
Which ones are the codes?

580
01:16:30,542 --> 01:16:32,336
Red envelope.

581
01:16:36,131 --> 01:16:40,052
Crystal Peak. You have
to get to crystal Peak.

582
01:16:40,135 --> 01:16:42,346
- What is he saying?
- Crystal Peak.

583
01:16:42,554 --> 01:16:45,140
A hardened facility
in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

584
01:16:45,349 --> 01:16:49,144
Fifty-two miles northeast,
bearing 0.5 degrees.

585
01:16:49,228 --> 01:16:50,938
That's the system core?

586
01:16:51,522 --> 01:16:53,649
It's your only chance.

587
01:16:53,857 --> 01:16:58,820
You'll need a plane. The particle
accelerator leads to the runway.

588
01:17:00,822 --> 01:17:02,533
Take care of my daughter.

589
01:17:05,035 --> 01:17:08,455
Oh, Katie, I am sorry.

590
01:17:08,539 --> 01:17:11,834
I opened Pandora's box.

591
01:17:13,043 --> 01:17:14,044
Get down!

592
01:17:30,435 --> 01:17:32,855
There's nothing you can do. Come on.

593
01:17:33,021 --> 01:17:35,148
We must go. It is not safe here.

594
01:17:35,858 --> 01:17:38,360
Kate, we have to go.

595
01:17:38,527 --> 01:17:42,239
Kate! He wanted you to come with me.

596
01:17:42,447 --> 01:17:46,535
He wanted us to shut Skynet down.
Come on.

597
01:17:48,328 --> 01:17:49,746
Come on.

598
01:18:01,758 --> 01:18:03,343
Run!

599
01:19:38,063 --> 01:19:39,648
Let's go.

600
01:20:51,053 --> 01:20:53,847
That's it. We can follow it
out to the runway.

601
01:20:54,056 --> 01:20:55,724
Come on.

602
01:21:52,656 --> 01:21:53,657
What?

603
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:56,660
Nothing.

604
01:21:57,744 --> 01:21:59,955
You remind me of my mother.

605
01:22:17,264 --> 01:22:19,725
Oh, God. She's coming.

606
01:22:23,353 --> 01:22:25,147
What are you doing?

607
01:22:26,231 --> 01:22:27,357
Powering up.

608
01:22:32,529 --> 01:22:33,655
Come on.

609
01:23:44,226 --> 01:23:45,644
It's working.

610
01:23:50,232 --> 01:23:52,860
Just die, you bitch!

611
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:58,240
Come on.

612
01:25:14,441 --> 01:25:17,236
There's my father's plane.
I trained on it.

613
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:30,541
Yes! He made it.

614
01:25:32,543 --> 01:25:34,545
Get away from me.

615
01:25:36,964 --> 01:25:38,048
Leave!

616
01:25:39,758 --> 01:25:40,843
Now!

617
01:25:41,343 --> 01:25:42,553
Let's go!

618
01:25:47,432 --> 01:25:50,561
- The master's on. Throttle's set.
- Come on. Let's go.

619
01:25:56,567 --> 01:25:59,528
Oh, please. You can't do this.

620
01:25:59,736 --> 01:26:01,446
I have no choice.

621
01:26:02,364 --> 01:26:04,658
The T-X...

622
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:07,327
...has corrupted my system.

623
01:26:10,956 --> 01:26:14,042
You can't kill a human being.
You said so yourself.

624
01:26:14,126 --> 01:26:16,044
Let him go!

625
01:26:20,632 --> 01:26:22,426
You're fighting it right now.

626
01:26:23,343 --> 01:26:25,429
My cPU is intact.

627
01:26:26,054 --> 01:26:29,850
But I cannot control my other functions.

628
01:26:30,058 --> 01:26:33,645
You don't have to do this.
You don't want to do this!

629
01:26:34,146 --> 01:26:38,150
Desire is irrelevant.

630
01:26:38,358 --> 01:26:40,944
I am a machine.

631
01:26:57,461 --> 01:26:59,129
What is your mission?

632
01:27:00,964 --> 01:27:04,426
To ensure the survival of John connor...

633
01:27:04,635 --> 01:27:06,637
...and Katherine Brewster.

634
01:27:12,059 --> 01:27:15,229
You are about to fail that mission!

635
01:27:22,027 --> 01:27:24,863
I can... I cannot.

636
01:27:25,948 --> 01:27:28,158
You know what you have to do.

637
01:27:30,035 --> 01:27:32,663
You know my destiny.

638
01:27:37,334 --> 01:27:38,460
I have to live.

639
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:21,753
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

640
01:28:21,837 --> 01:28:24,548
He couldn't do it.
He shut himself down.

641
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:30,846
- Can you fly?
- Yeah.

642
01:28:58,248 --> 01:29:00,459
Okay. 015 degrees...

643
01:29:00,667 --> 01:29:04,838
...52 miles, our max air speed
is about 160.

644
01:29:05,047 --> 01:29:07,466
We've got 32 minutes.

645
01:29:07,549 --> 01:29:09,468
It's just you and me now.

646
01:29:09,551 --> 01:29:12,054
What if we can't stop it?

647
01:29:12,638 --> 01:29:16,266
There's enough c-4 here
to take out 10 supercomputers.

648
01:29:16,767 --> 01:29:19,061
We're gonna make it, Kate.

649
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:22,648
The future is up to us.

650
01:29:29,029 --> 01:29:31,365
That's gotta be it.

651
01:30:34,428 --> 01:30:37,556
Skynet. There may be more of them.

652
01:30:55,449 --> 01:30:57,242
Come on.

653
01:31:11,465 --> 01:31:14,635
I think this is some kind of blast door.

654
01:31:17,763 --> 01:31:20,432
There's no way
we can blow through this thing.

655
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:22,643
John, look.

656
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:27,147
Now what?

657
01:31:29,942 --> 01:31:32,236
It's a code prompt.

658
01:31:39,451 --> 01:31:42,454
Type in "Dakota 775."

659
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:48,961
"Red 176."

660
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:12,359
Come on!
We gotta get this thing open.

661
01:32:12,568 --> 01:32:14,444
Here. It's "Avalon 412."

662
01:32:15,362 --> 01:32:16,655
Put it in!

663
01:32:51,064 --> 01:32:52,441
Come on!

664
01:33:08,957 --> 01:33:10,459
I'm back.

665
01:33:25,849 --> 01:33:28,060
Go! Now!

666
01:33:28,644 --> 01:33:29,645
Come on!

667
01:33:52,751 --> 01:33:55,045
- Thank you.
- We'll meet again.

668
01:33:55,337 --> 01:33:56,547
Go!

669
01:33:57,631 --> 01:33:58,632
Come on!

670
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:44,761
You are terminated.

671
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,337
The elevator.

672
01:35:24,968 --> 01:35:27,346
I'll set the detonator for five minutes.

673
01:35:27,846 --> 01:35:30,265
That should give us enough time
to get back up.

674
01:36:01,672 --> 01:36:03,340
What is this place?

675
01:36:44,047 --> 01:36:46,550
These computers are 30 years old.

676
01:36:55,058 --> 01:36:56,935
This isn't Skynet.

677
01:37:01,648 --> 01:37:03,442
There's nothing here.

678
01:37:08,655 --> 01:37:11,450
This is a fallout shelter for vlPs.

679
01:37:13,243 --> 01:37:15,662
Only they never got the warning.

680
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:21,960
Goddamn it!

681
01:37:24,254 --> 01:37:26,757
There's nothing here!

682
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,153
Why didn't he tell us?

683
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:53,951
Why did he lead us down here?

684
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:01,333
To live.

685
01:38:02,459 --> 01:38:04,461
That was his mission.

686
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:20,561
There was never any stopping it.

687
01:38:24,147 --> 01:38:25,566
John...

688
01:38:26,859 --> 01:38:28,569
...we could just...

689
01:38:29,361 --> 01:38:30,654
...let it go.

690
01:38:33,532 --> 01:38:34,867
Hello?

691
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:37,870
Hello? Can somebody hear me?

692
01:38:38,954 --> 01:38:40,747
This is Montana Civil Defense.

693
01:38:42,332 --> 01:38:44,543
Somebody please come in.

694
01:38:45,043 --> 01:38:46,753
Is there anybody there?

695
01:38:47,045 --> 01:38:50,048
Anyone reading me? Over.

696
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:55,470
Rumors about a launch sequence.
Command and control have broken down.

697
01:38:56,763 --> 01:38:59,850
Is anyone receiving me?
Somebody?

698
01:39:01,852 --> 01:39:03,854
Somebody please come in.

699
01:39:04,354 --> 01:39:05,647
Anybody out there?

700
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:09,234
- This is SAC Nellis. We're under attack.
- CQ? CQ?

701
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:11,069
Is anybody there?

702
01:39:13,071 --> 01:39:16,742
This is John connor at crystal Peak.

703
01:39:17,659 --> 01:39:22,456
Connor? What the hell is happening?
Who's in charge there?

704
01:39:29,254 --> 01:39:30,547
I am.

705
01:39:31,965 --> 01:39:34,259
Connor, can you help us?

706
01:39:34,551 --> 01:39:39,473
This is Montana Civil Defense.
Where did you say you were again?

707
01:39:42,768 --> 01:39:45,562
By the time Skynet
became self-aware...

708
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:50,234
...it had spread into millions
of computer servers across the planet.

709
01:39:51,068 --> 01:39:55,948
Ordinary computers in office buildings,
dorm rooms, everywhere.

710
01:39:57,741 --> 01:40:01,453
It was software and cyberspace.

711
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:07,459
There was no system core.
It could not be shut down.

712
01:40:08,752 --> 01:40:13,757
The attack began at 6: 18 p.m.,
just as he said it would.

713
01:40:14,758 --> 01:40:16,468
Judgment Day.

714
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:19,847
The day the human race
was nearly destroyed...

715
01:40:20,055 --> 01:40:22,766
...by weapons they'd built
to protect themselves.

716
01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:30,357
I should have realized our destiny
was never to stop Judgment Day.

717
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:33,861
It was merely to survive it...

718
01:40:34,444 --> 01:40:36,655
...together.

719
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:41,869
The Terminator knew.

720
01:40:42,369 --> 01:40:44,872
He tried to tell us...

721
01:40:45,664 --> 01:40:48,333
...but I didn't want to hear it.

722
01:40:50,669 --> 01:40:54,673
Maybe the future has been written.
I don't know.

723
01:40:55,674 --> 01:40:58,343
All I know is what
the Terminator taught me:

724
01:40:59,052 --> 01:41:01,346
Never stop fighting.

725
01:41:01,555 --> 01:41:04,141
And I never will.

726
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:10,147
The battle has just begun.
