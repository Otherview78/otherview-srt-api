1
00:05:18,782 --> 00:05:20,062
<i>Attention all workers.</i>

2
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,848
<i>Attention all workers.</i>

3
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:25,084
<i>Day shift starting
in T-minus 15 minutes.</i>

4
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:28,723
<i>Farmers to report
to mess hall immediately.</i>

5
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,621
<i>If you are experiencing
any symptoms,</i>

6
00:05:30,757 --> 00:05:32,056
<i>such as fever, cough,</i>

7
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:34,125
<i>vomiting,
or difficulty breathing,</i>

8
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:36,795
<i>proceed to the medical bay
for examination.</i>

9
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:40,262
<i>The safety and well-being
of our colony</i>

10
00:05:40,397 --> 00:05:43,431
<i>is Weyland-Yutani's
top priority.</i>

11
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,677
<i>Attention all workers...</i>

12
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:49,441
<i>Did you hear about
the claustrophobic astronaut?</i>

13
00:05:49,577 --> 00:05:50,577
<i>He needed space.</i>

14
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:52,248
I'm begging you,
you got to stop.

15
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:56,447
I just spent my full share
on a belt that won't fit.

16
00:05:56,582 --> 00:05:57,812
Huge waist.

17
00:05:57,948 --> 00:05:59,182
See that cornbread.

18
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:04,457
Maybe it's 'cause
I'm on this seafood diet.

19
00:06:04,592 --> 00:06:06,464
I see food, I eat it.

20
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,124
That's so bad.

21
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:10,792
You always laughed
at that one.

22
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:12,504
Yeah, when I was 12.

23
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,773
I'm sure it's Mr. Finch.

24
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:21,479
We owe him three months today.

25
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:24,207
He'll call again.

26
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:29,415
Well, maybe we won't be here
when he does.

27
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,430
Andy.
Stay close to me.

28
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:44,193
<i>Wake up. Wake up now.</i>

29
00:06:44,328 --> 00:06:46,835
<i>We're all
Weyland-Yutani slaves.</i>

30
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:49,232
<i>The company pays us
with food and shelter</i>

31
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,572
<i>and takes our lives
in exchange.</i>

32
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,776
<i>Don't believe their lies.</i>

33
00:06:55,477 --> 00:06:57,348
<i>They own you!</i>

34
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,117
Andy, Andy.
Hey, hey, hey.

35
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,716
Hey, Andy. Come on. Come on.

36
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,422
- What did I do?
- It's a scam.

37
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,418
The ball is never under
the cup that you pick.

38
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:07,554
It's a trick.

39
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:10,026
But how am I
gonna get the money?

40
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:11,254
Money for what?

41
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,132
To pay for the horse
when we get to Yvaga.

42
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,067
You're gonna get a horse?

43
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,999
I wanna call it Raindy.

44
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:22,640
Do you get it?

45
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,876
- Raindy.
- No, I like it.

46
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,742
Yeah, it's good.

47
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:30,840
Okay, so you just
wait over there.

48
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:32,341
Okay, I might be a minute.

49
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:35,247
Stay out of trouble,
all right?

50
00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:38,418
<i>All employees will be seen.</i>

51
00:07:38,553 --> 00:07:39,789
Good luck.

52
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:41,983
<i>Line up in an orderly fashion.</i>

53
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,351
<i>Next.</i>

54
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:45,321
<i>Full name
and occupation, please.</i>

55
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:48,859
<i>Marie Raines Carradine, ma'am.
Farming.</i>

56
00:07:48,994 --> 00:07:51,098
It's about my travel papers.

57
00:07:51,234 --> 00:07:54,066
<i>I met my quota, and I should
be free to go now.</i>

58
00:07:54,435 --> 00:07:55,468
Right?

59
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:56,775
Go where?

60
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,404
<i>Yvaga.</i>

61
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:02,537
<i>It's an independent system,
but it's fully terraformed.</i>

62
00:08:02,672 --> 00:08:04,775
<i>You can actually see
the sun out there.</i>

63
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:06,409
<i>Where are your parents?</i>

64
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:10,749
<i>Uh, they died
three cycles ago.</i>

65
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:13,283
Lung disease, from the mines.

66
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:16,056
<i>It's just me
and my brother now.</i>

67
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:17,569
<i>They sell us hope</i>

68
00:08:17,593 --> 00:08:19,258
<i>to keep us slaves.</i>

69
00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:25,328
<i>They sell us hope to keep
us slaves. Wake up now.</i>

70
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,052
I'm sorry,
but you're not eligible

71
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:39,250
for contract release yet.

72
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,520
Due to a shortage of workers,

73
00:08:40,544 --> 00:08:42,024
you're being
transferred to the mines.

74
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,919
<i>Wait, what?</i>

75
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:46,091
<i>No, no, no,
I reached the required hours.</i>

76
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,517
You have to let me go.

77
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,418
Unfortunately, quotas have
been raised to 24,000 hours,

78
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:52,087
so you'll be released
from contract

79
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,456
in another five to six years.

80
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:55,712
Thank you, and remember
the company is really grateful

81
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,126
for your ongoing service.

82
00:08:57,261 --> 00:08:59,564
- Rain!
- Hey!

83
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:00,765
Hey, stop!

84
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:03,135
Get off him! You bastards!

85
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:06,639
I got you, I got you.

86
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:08,173
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

87
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:11,980
Okay.

88
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,482
You're okay.

89
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:17,219
I'm resetting you.

90
00:09:17,354 --> 00:09:18,354
I got you.

91
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:21,987
It's okay.

92
00:09:22,123 --> 00:09:23,661
I shouldn't
have left you alone.

93
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,675
<i>They sell us hope</i>

94
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:32,699
<i>to keep us slaves.</i>

95
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:35,068
<i>Wake up now. They own you.</i>

96
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:39,471
<i>Hi, Rain.</i>

97
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:40,954
<i>Look, I'm sorry. I know
I've been calling you all day,</i>

98
00:09:40,978 --> 00:09:42,371
<i>but, look,
something's come up,</i>

99
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:44,012
<i>and I think you should
know about it.</i>

100
00:09:44,147 --> 00:09:46,981
<i>So, come by the trailers
and bring Andy.</i>

101
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,215
Hey.

102
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:20,346
Oh, for...

103
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:22,189
<i>Game over, man.</i>

104
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:25,014
Sup, Rain? Long time no see.

105
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,988
I told you she'd show up.

106
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:28,990
You owe me five bucks.

107
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:31,224
<i>Andy!</i>

108
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:36,230
Why'd the blind miner
fall down the well?

109
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:37,636
Why?

110
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:40,645
'Cause he couldn't see
that well.

111
00:10:41,804 --> 00:10:43,533
Please don't encourage him.

112
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:46,007
All right, go inside.
I'll be there in a second.

113
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:53,250
- Kay.
- Rain.

114
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:54,413
- Hi.
- Hi!

115
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:55,610
Hi.

116
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:58,183
I missed you.

117
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:00,384
And I know my brother
missed you, too.

118
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,061
I'm really glad you came.

119
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:10,465
I heard about your dad.

120
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
I'm really sorry.

121
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,132
Well, between the hailstorms

122
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:15,638
and the new diseases
every cycle...

123
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:17,439
Yeah, everybody's dying, right?

124
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:19,239
So, should we show her?

125
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:21,074
Show me what?

126
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,076
Okay, so, last night,

127
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:25,750
we're loading up
the last Tesotek,

128
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,320
we're about 200 miles
above the ground,

129
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:28,549
and then all of a sudden...

130
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:31,755
The hauler picks up
this beacon.

131
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,886
So Navarro tracks it,
and it turns out

132
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:35,185
there's this big Wey-Yu ship

133
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,853
drifting
right above our heads.

134
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:37,988
Drifting?

135
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:39,622
Decommissioned. Abandoned.

136
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:41,926
Some old relic. It's probably
damaged or obsolete.

137
00:11:42,062 --> 00:11:43,431
Like that guy over there.

138
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:44,566
Bjorn.

139
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:48,001
Okay, just tell her.

140
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:49,806
Why are we all
sitting around here

141
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,622
waiting for travel permits
that the company

142
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,437
are never gonna give to us?

143
00:11:53,572 --> 00:11:54,852
'Cause that hauler
has enough power in it

144
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:55,945
to get us to Yvaga.

145
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,608
Because it takes nine years
to get to Yvaga

146
00:11:58,743 --> 00:12:01,014
and you can't make that trip
without cryo-sleep.

147
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,552
Decommissioned ships
still carry

148
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:03,848
tons of functional equipment.

149
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:05,248
And the hyperlink shows

150
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:07,418
that ship
still has a few pods left.

151
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:14,324
You want to break into
a Weyland-Yutani ship

152
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,928
and steal highly
regulated equipment?

153
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:18,431
Before someone else does.

154
00:12:20,165 --> 00:12:21,400
You guys are insane.

155
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:22,885
- Well, of course we are.
- No. No, we're not.

156
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,179
- This is...
- That's what I said.

157
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:25,568
Are you gonna help us?

158
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,748
Sorry,
what do you need me for?

159
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:33,045
Andy.

160
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,911
- We need to use Andy.
- Andy?

161
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,383
Mm-hmm.

162
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,855
He's a Weyland-Yutani
synthetic. He speaks Mother.

163
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,363
He can access
a terminal on the ship

164
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:41,954
to get us in and out
without a fuss.

165
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:43,287
It's the only way to get in.

166
00:12:43,423 --> 00:12:45,490
Okay,
but what if we get caught?

167
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:48,399
It'll ruin our chances of ever
getting a travel permit.

168
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:49,964
Right, Rain's not comin'.

169
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,001
Uh, how about you let us
take Andy then?

170
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:56,103
I'm not sending
my brother up there alone.

171
00:12:56,238 --> 00:12:57,638
He's not your
brother though, is he?

172
00:12:57,705 --> 00:12:59,616
- Bjorn, shut the fuck up.
- It's true, though, isn't it?

173
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,153
He's not your brother.
It's just Wey-Yu damaged goods

174
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:02,539
that your dad
found in the trash.

175
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:04,981
And that's all he is, Rain.
So just wake up.

176
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:06,543
Let's go.

177
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:07,688
- Rain?
- What?

178
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:10,347
- I didn't say anything.
- Rain, wait.

179
00:13:10,482 --> 00:13:11,767
I'm sorry.
Listen, I know my cousin

180
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,900
can be a dick sometimes,
all right?

181
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:14,617
But he is right
about something.

182
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,625
You need to wake up.

183
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,762
Because this company,

184
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,240
they're not gonna
give us anything.

185
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:21,072
You know that as well as I do.
We have to take it.

186
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:26,871
Rain, I just...

187
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,005
I don't want to end up
like our parents.

188
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:30,765
Do you?

189
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:40,050
Is it as easy as you're making
it sound, this plan of yours?

190
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:42,313
You won't even have to get out
of the <i>Corbelan.</i>

191
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:44,416
That much
I can promise you, okay?

192
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:50,092
Come on. What do you say?

193
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:15,986
Bjorn, hurry up,
let's go.

194
00:14:19,718 --> 00:14:23,026
All right, I'm starting
her up. Batteries on.

195
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:26,789
Lovely.

196
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:29,506
Could I get hydro, please?

197
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:31,634
Comm panel.

198
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:34,670
Ground spoilers.

199
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:36,063
They are armed.

200
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,046
First time
in space, huh?

201
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,273
Yeah.

202
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:42,703
You too? Boop!

203
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,772
- Fuel pump.
- On.

204
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:46,227
Two space virgins
coming through.

205
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,282
Right, take a good look
outside the window

206
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:50,680
'cause the way I see it,
we're never coming back.

207
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:05,226
You good?

208
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:06,361
I'm good.

209
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:08,369
Yeah. It's gonna be all right.

210
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:28,987
Are you sure
this is a good idea now?

211
00:15:29,122 --> 00:15:30,390
Sure, Dad.

212
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:37,166
Here comes the crush.

213
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,582
That's how it's done, bitch.

214
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:55,079
Is that...

215
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,679
Yeah.

216
00:16:57,814 --> 00:16:59,545
That is our sun.

217
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:14,432
They say Yvaga has
the most incredible sunsets.

218
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,100
I've seen them.

219
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,764
In my dreams.

220
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:23,107
I can't wait
to see them with you.

221
00:17:26,469 --> 00:17:27,474
Yeah.

222
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,284
You know, I heard that
cryo-sleep just makes years

223
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:34,052
feel like one night
of heavy drinkin' apparently.

224
00:17:34,076 --> 00:17:36,318
So when we wake up
in Yvaga tomorrow,

225
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,980
we'll wake up with a hangover.

226
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,331
There she is.

227
00:17:51,594 --> 00:17:53,060
That's not a ship.

228
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:55,229
No.

229
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,275
<i>Fuck,
that's big. What is that?</i>

230
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,308
<i>Decommissioned outpost?
I don't know.</i>

231
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:00,968
<i>Probably got dragged
into our orbit.</i>

232
00:18:01,103 --> 00:18:03,047
Okay, Navarro,
let's get closer, please.

233
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,380
Okay.
I'm gonna match its roll.

234
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:24,465
<i>Hazard proximity alert.</i>

235
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:26,963
What's wrong?

236
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:29,338
It's just the belt's a bit
closer than I thought.

237
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:32,275
How long?

238
00:18:33,704 --> 00:18:35,337
It's 36 hours, give or take.

239
00:18:35,472 --> 00:18:36,609
Till what?

240
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:39,375
Before the station crashes
against the rings.

241
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:41,252
Sorry, what?

242
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,719
What did you just say?
That doesn't sound very good.

243
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:44,956
36 hours.

244
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,751
We should be in and out
in 30 minutes.

245
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:48,955
Yeah?

246
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,090
Andy.

247
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:51,787
Yeah, tops.

248
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,330
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

249
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:57,901
I have just one directive.

250
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,061
To do what's best for Rain.

251
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:02,998
Your dad wrote it.

252
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:04,538
Yeah.

253
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:07,336
That and too many dad jokes.

254
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:08,773
I'm happy...

255
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:11,006
to help.

256
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,485
Be careful out there.

257
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:35,404
Okay, hurry up.
We're docking in two minutes.

258
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:38,836
Put that on.

259
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,454
Now,
why I gotta put this on for?

260
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:42,015
So you don't
freeze your balls off.

261
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,159
Mate,
you gotta stop obsessing

262
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,583
about my balls, man.
It's unhealthy.

263
00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:46,155
Keep talking
and I'll chop 'em off.

264
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:48,090
Aw, you really want
'em for yourself, don't you?

265
00:19:48,114 --> 00:19:49,591
Hey, you want me to show you
my balls or something?

266
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:50,711
Oh, shut up a minute.

267
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:52,684
Gloves, here, take these.

268
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:55,050
Hey! No.
Stop touching shit.

269
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:56,595
- Come over here.
- Bjorn, leave him alone,

270
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:58,521
for fuck's sake.

271
00:19:58,656 --> 00:19:59,724
Andy, take no notice.

272
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,899
All right, okay,
won't be my fault

273
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:02,156
when he breaks somethin'.

274
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:10,942
There's a synth hatch

275
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:12,234
right ahead. I'm gonna dock.

276
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:14,329
<i>Copy that.
Just bring us in slow.</i>

277
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:42,306
Oh, fuck me,
it's cold in there.

278
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:44,033
What's that?

279
00:20:44,168 --> 00:20:46,243
<i>It's a temp-scanner.</i>

280
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,203
<i>It's gonna lead us
to the pods.</i>

281
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,213
Okay, compression
is good enough.

282
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:54,518
Oxygen is too thin to breathe.

283
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:55,744
Andy...

284
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,152
<i>...you're up.</i>

285
00:20:57,287 --> 00:20:58,751
<i>It's your time to shine.</i>

286
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:06,522
<i>Yes! Andy!</i>

287
00:21:06,657 --> 00:21:07,727
<i>Beautiful work.</i>

288
00:21:08,295 --> 00:21:09,300
<i>Okay.</i>

289
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:13,229
<i>Congrats.
You're not a virgin anymore.</i>

290
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,130
<i>All right.</i>

291
00:21:25,645 --> 00:21:27,043
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

292
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,342
<i>Fuck.</i>

293
00:22:00,477 --> 00:22:02,277
<i>Guys, it looks like
we're in zero-g.</i>

294
00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:04,322
<i>Yeah, I can feel it
in my stomach.</i>

295
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
Wait, what's that?

296
00:22:10,854 --> 00:22:12,256
Gravity generators.

297
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:14,960
When offline, they still purge
themselves every few minutes.

298
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:17,192
<i>Prevents the place
from blowing up.</i>

299
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:23,298
<i>Oh, fuck me,
there goes my stomach again.</i>

300
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:25,541
<i>Okay, straight ahead.</i>

301
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:03,951
<i>According
to the scanner,</i>

302
00:23:03,975 --> 00:23:05,339
<i>the pods should be in here.</i>

303
00:23:33,936 --> 00:23:35,341
<i>Jesus.</i>

304
00:23:35,476 --> 00:23:36,572
<i>Andy, you good?</i>

305
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:37,778
Yeah.

306
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:46,754
<i>All right, great news.
I've got eyes on the pods.</i>

307
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:52,496
<i>Fuck!</i>

308
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:56,764
<i>Bjorn, you okay?</i>

309
00:23:57,732 --> 00:23:59,195
<i>Fuck!</i>

310
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,138
<i>I think I fractured
my asshole.</i>

311
00:24:05,868 --> 00:24:08,677
<i>Fuckin' hell. Don't fuck
with this gravity purge, man.</i>

312
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:25,529
<i>Thank God,
there's still</i>

313
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:26,794
<i>some power left in this relic.</i>

314
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,480
<i>Okay, watch out.
Gravity's coming back.</i>

315
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:48,079
<i>Fuckin' hell.</i>

316
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,489
All right, here we go.

317
00:24:56,624 --> 00:24:57,759
Let's see what we got.

318
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,223
Okay.

319
00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:07,501
- Shit.
- What's the problem?

320
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:08,896
Pods don't have enough fuel.

321
00:25:09,031 --> 00:25:10,367
What do you mean?

322
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:12,114
<i>They're loaded up
for three years in stasis.</i>

323
00:25:12,138 --> 00:25:13,188
Yeah,
but it takes nine years

324
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,403
to get to Yvaga, mate.

325
00:25:14,538 --> 00:25:16,191
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'm aware of that.

326
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:17,676
Fuckin' hell.

327
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:18,976
I knew it. I fuckin' knew it.

328
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:20,221
- I knew it.
- Just relax.

329
00:25:20,245 --> 00:25:21,488
Maybe you guys
should just come back.

330
00:25:21,512 --> 00:25:23,072
<i>No, no,
we're not givin' up now.</i>

331
00:25:24,953 --> 00:25:26,062
Yvaga's
the nearest system.

332
00:25:26,086 --> 00:25:28,889
So what are we supposed
to do now? Huh?

333
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:31,024
- What are we gonna do?
- Shut up.

334
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,990
Okay, strong reading.
Must be a cryo depot nearby.

335
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,925
We should find
more fuel there.

336
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:39,365
Navarro, I'm ejecting the EEV.

337
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:40,704
Come on, Andy.

338
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,679
You guys pick it up
while we get the cryo-fuel.

339
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:03,693
Hold.

340
00:26:04,894 --> 00:26:06,762
Yeah, 400 yards away,
dead ahead.

341
00:26:08,258 --> 00:26:09,460
What's with the military shit?

342
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:10,533
What?

343
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,713
All that military shit.

344
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,196
- Well, it's effective.
- Is it?

345
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:15,611
- And cool.
- It's not very cool.

346
00:26:15,671 --> 00:26:17,333
You just look like a twat.

347
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:18,947
- I'm sorry.
- All right, chill.

348
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:20,305
<i>Let's keep it movin'.</i>

349
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:21,680
<i>If you do that again,
I'll fuck you up.</i>

350
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:22,988
- Bjorn, back off!
<i>- You understand?</i>

351
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:24,417
<i>Just as long as he stays
out of my way.</i>

352
00:26:24,441 --> 00:26:26,912
Why is he being
such a dick to him?

353
00:26:27,048 --> 00:26:29,752
Because of what happened
to his mom.

354
00:26:29,887 --> 00:26:31,391
- What do you mean?
- Last cycle,

355
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:33,019
there was a gas leak
in the mines,

356
00:26:33,154 --> 00:26:35,152
so a synthetic made the call
to seal them

357
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:37,257
with Bjorn's mom
still trapped inside.

358
00:26:37,392 --> 00:26:38,526
What?

359
00:26:38,662 --> 00:26:40,058
Synthetics can't harm humans.

360
00:26:40,194 --> 00:26:43,392
It sacrificed three miners
to save a dozen.

361
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:46,703
That, they can do.

362
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,435
That's terrible.

363
00:27:37,983 --> 00:27:40,383
I got you, I got you.

364
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:44,024
Come on, come on, come on.

365
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:47,258
Easy, easy.

366
00:27:51,995 --> 00:27:53,495
Good job.

367
00:27:58,137 --> 00:27:59,336
Kay!

368
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,705
Kay! Hey, hey, hey.

369
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:03,406
Hey, hey, hey.

370
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,250
I'm right here.
I'm right here. You're okay.

371
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:07,725
I'm gonna go
check on the pods.

372
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,463
No, no. Don't worry.

373
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,834
I'm not sick.

374
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,170
What's wrong, then?

375
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,206
Nothing is.

376
00:28:37,645 --> 00:28:39,079
Oh, girl.

377
00:28:41,914 --> 00:28:43,149
Who's the father?

378
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,580
Some asshole.

379
00:28:47,353 --> 00:28:50,728
Just don't tell my brother, okay?

380
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:53,462
He has enough things
to worry about.

381
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,524
No. I won't say anything.

382
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:58,736
I'm just happy this baby
will get to see the sun.

383
00:29:21,321 --> 00:29:23,090
I think
we're almost there.

384
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:28,831
Okay, Navarro.

385
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,226
<i>Airlock 5-B,
that's our way out</i>

386
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:31,565
<i>once we find this cryo-fuel.</i>

387
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:32,770
On my way.

388
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:34,044
<i>Welcome to the</i>

389
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:35,502
Renaissance <i>Space Station,</i>

390
00:29:35,637 --> 00:29:39,833
<i>the center of Weyland-Yutani

391
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:43,105
<i>The station

392
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,178

<i>mankind's role in outer space.</i>

395
00:29:54,023 --> 00:29:56,993
This place
gives me the creeps.

396
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,259
Did you hear about the miner
who lost his left side?

397
00:30:01,764 --> 00:30:02,764
He's all right now.

398
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:04,230
Do you get it? He's all right.

399
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:06,331
Can you turn
yourself off, please?

400
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:08,771
You said you were nervous

401
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,083
and I was trying
to make sure you were...

402
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:13,072
Jesus! You know, I can't
wait to get in them pods

403
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:15,208
and never see you again,
you know that?

404
00:30:17,111 --> 00:30:18,839
<i>You'll see me in Yvaga.</i>

405
00:30:18,974 --> 00:30:20,454
<i>No,
you're not going to Yvaga.</i>

406
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:21,676
<i>Bjorn, stop!</i>

407
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:23,418
<i>I'm not?</i>

408
00:30:23,553 --> 00:30:24,553
Well done.

409
00:30:24,688 --> 00:30:26,417
Oh, she didn't tell you?

410
00:30:26,553 --> 00:30:29,585
Yeah, yeah, it's a
non-Weyland-Yutani system,

411
00:30:30,992 --> 00:30:33,028
so no fake people allowed.

412
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,032
I prefer the term
"artificial person" myself.

413
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,102
Andy, look.

414
00:30:41,238 --> 00:30:42,717
<i>Rain could end up in prison</i>

415
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:43,781
<i>if she takes you with her.</i>

416
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:45,049
<i>And if you guys
stay in Jackson,</i>

417
00:30:45,073 --> 00:30:46,473
<i>it's just a matter of time</i>

418
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:48,670
<i>before you get decommissioned
again by the company.</i>

419
00:30:49,404 --> 00:30:51,113
<i>You understand?</i>

420
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:53,345
<i>I need you on the ship
to guard the pods.</i>

421
00:30:54,014 --> 00:30:55,380
But once we get there...

422
00:30:56,686 --> 00:30:57,849
Decommish.

423
00:30:57,985 --> 00:30:58,985
Lights out for good.

424
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:01,922
You done?

425
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:03,388
<i>Just tellin' the truth.</i>

426
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,156
<i>That's okay.</i>

427
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:12,694
<i>If it's what's best for Rain,
it's what's best for me.</i>

428
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,403
You're a good guy, Andy.

429
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,076
We're all gonna miss you.

430
00:31:26,817 --> 00:31:28,116
So he didn't know?

431
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:32,186
I just did not
have the heart to tell him.

432
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,354
You shouldn't feel bad.

433
00:31:37,793 --> 00:31:38,828
Shit.

434
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,040
You're not gonna throw

435
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,130
your whole life away
for Andy's sake.

436
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,761
He doesn't care.
It doesn't matter to him.

437
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,138
Okay? He's not...

438
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:52,767
you know, real.

439
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:18,430
The signal's
coming from in here.

440
00:32:28,104 --> 00:32:30,512
Thought you said
this place was decommissioned.

441
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,313
Yeah.

442
00:32:32,448 --> 00:32:34,517
<i>Doesn't look
decommissioned to me.</i>

443
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:35,784
No, it doesn't.

444
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,011
But it's definitely deserted.

445
00:32:38,146 --> 00:32:40,949
Hey, Andy, look at this.

446
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,324
I could probably fry a
synthetic with one of these...

447
00:32:43,993 --> 00:32:45,626
if I just amp up the juices.

448
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,712
Hey, you know, I might
take this with me, actually.

449
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:51,826
All right, enough.

450
00:32:51,961 --> 00:32:53,994
Just in case you have
any fucking funny ideas.

451
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,902
It's a joke.
I was joking.

452
00:32:58,038 --> 00:32:59,207
What the fuck?

453
00:32:59,643 --> 00:33:00,643
Watch out.

454
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:12,352
<i>Shit.</i>

455
00:33:17,124 --> 00:33:18,319
It's only a synthetic.

456
00:33:20,422 --> 00:33:22,055
Fuck.

457
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:24,197
I thought it was a real person
there for a second.

458
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,860
<i>What happened in there?</i>

459
00:33:25,995 --> 00:33:28,038
Don't know.
A chemical spill, maybe.

460
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,173
The fuel must be in that room.

461
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:31,922
Let's grab it
and get the fuck out of here.

462
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,148
All right. Andy?

463
00:33:53,428 --> 00:33:54,868
Bjorn,
take the torch please.

464
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:01,795
I don't think
there's any pods in here.

465
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:03,282
Nah,
just cooling equipment.

466
00:34:03,306 --> 00:34:05,240
Uses the same type of fuel, though.

467
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:12,516
Yes.

468
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:15,453
<i>Forty-five Ks.</i>

469
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,386
<i>It's more than enough fuel
to get us to Yvaga.</i>

470
00:34:18,521 --> 00:34:21,124
Right. Bjorn, give me
a hand with this, please.

471
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,208
Bjorn, pull it out
on three, all right?

472
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:33,559
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

473
00:34:33,695 --> 00:34:35,072
One, two...

474
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,002
three.

475
00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:38,466
Fuck!

476
00:34:38,602 --> 00:34:39,769
- Fuck.
- My fingers.

477
00:34:41,637 --> 00:34:42,640
I can't feel my fingers.

478
00:34:50,454 --> 00:34:52,121
<i>It really hurts.
Just froze my hands off.</i>

479
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,687
- What's happening?
<i>- Fuck.</i>

480
00:34:53,822 --> 00:34:56,383
Don't know. It's some
kind of emergency lockdown.

481
00:34:56,518 --> 00:34:58,051
Andy, the door.

482
00:35:01,397 --> 00:35:02,797
Shit, he doesn't
have the clearance.

483
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,158
What does that mean?

484
00:35:04,293 --> 00:35:06,212
Doesn't have the
clearance to open the door.

485
00:35:06,236 --> 00:35:07,476
So you're trying
to tell me that

486
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:08,941
he can fucking reboot
the entire ship,

487
00:35:08,965 --> 00:35:10,014
but can't open
a random fucking door

488
00:35:10,038 --> 00:35:11,139
to a random room?

489
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,407
Well, obviously,
that's no random room.

490
00:35:16,805 --> 00:35:18,577
Come on!

491
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:20,282
Come on!

492
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,729
Hey, don't worry.
We'll get 'em out of there.

493
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,369
If Andy
can't open those doors,

494
00:35:44,504 --> 00:35:46,440
I doubt
we'll have better luck.

495
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:49,769
He's a Weyland-Yutani
synthetic

496
00:35:49,904 --> 00:35:50,984
and we're just trespassing.

497
00:35:52,247 --> 00:35:54,041
Yeah, so you got any ideas?

498
00:35:54,642 --> 00:35:55,642
Not yet.

499
00:35:58,256 --> 00:35:59,684
I think it's in here.

500
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,458
Bjorn!

501
00:36:06,323 --> 00:36:07,329
Tyler!

502
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:12,994
They're in there.

503
00:36:17,535 --> 00:36:18,634
Hey, what are you doing?

504
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:19,980
If this module
is still working,

505
00:36:20,004 --> 00:36:22,509
I can try to transfer
its credentials to Andy.

506
00:36:22,644 --> 00:36:24,775
A higher clearance
should open that door.

507
00:37:00,379 --> 00:37:02,076
Shit. It's stuck.

508
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:06,488
It's so hot in here, man.

509
00:37:31,342 --> 00:37:32,348
Whoa.

510
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:35,110
Sick.

511
00:37:35,245 --> 00:37:36,591
Yeah, maybe try not to touch
anything in here.

512
00:37:36,615 --> 00:37:37,655
Yeah, okay, Mom.

513
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:43,486
Help me! Help!

514
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:44,621
Oh, no! What do I do?

515
00:37:44,754 --> 00:37:46,329
The module. Take it out!

516
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,127
You okay?

517
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:55,638
That was fucked up.

518
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,070
Here.

519
00:37:57,205 --> 00:37:58,473
Let me see.

520
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:01,844
Yes, okay.

521
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,011
All right.

522
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:05,208
- Got it.
- Hey.

523
00:38:05,343 --> 00:38:06,343
Rain.

524
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:09,319
This is from that synthetic.

525
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,322
Try putting it
on Andy's module.

526
00:38:16,554 --> 00:38:17,558
I'm so sorry.

527
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,989
Let's just get outta here.

528
00:38:21,557 --> 00:38:22,563
Andy?

529
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,501
All right, let's see.

530
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:30,774
Okay.

531
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,579
Fuck.

532
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,839
Rain, did I do something
wrong? He's just frozen up.

533
00:38:38,974 --> 00:38:40,216
He's just rebooting.

534
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:42,352
It's gonna take
a couple of minutes.

535
00:39:05,205 --> 00:39:07,445
Here, let me get you
something for those fingers.

536
00:39:14,876 --> 00:39:16,309
The fuck was that?

537
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:21,050
All right,
stay there a second.

538
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,154
Tyler?

539
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:32,226
Hey,
what are you guys doing?

540
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:42,906
Bjorn?

541
00:39:43,042 --> 00:39:44,357
Stop playing around, man.
Just get up.

542
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:45,426
I'm not
playing around.

543
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,626
There's something
in the water.

544
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,857
What do you mean?
What is it?

545
00:39:47,881 --> 00:39:49,057
I don't know.
I don't know what it is.

546
00:39:49,081 --> 00:39:50,601
There's something
in the fuckin' water.

547
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,085
Bjorn!

548
00:39:58,428 --> 00:40:00,263
Fuck!

549
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,678
What the fuck
was that?

550
00:40:07,234 --> 00:40:08,234
Andy!

551
00:40:10,468 --> 00:40:11,468
Bjorn!

552
00:40:17,744 --> 00:40:19,574
Bjorn, help him! Do something!

553
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,710
Bjorn!

554
00:40:25,248 --> 00:40:27,083
- Tyler!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

555
00:40:29,355 --> 00:40:30,493
Come on!

556
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:32,429
- Come on! Help me!
- No, stop. Stop. Don't...

557
00:40:32,553 --> 00:40:34,233
- No! Navarro!
- Those things will get out.

558
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:36,122
If they come in here...
If they come in...

559
00:40:36,257 --> 00:40:37,566
- If they come...
- No!

560
00:40:41,467 --> 00:40:42,637
Fuck. Fuck.

561
00:41:09,057 --> 00:41:10,731
Andy! Let's go!

562
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:13,870
Go! Bjorn!

563
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,198
Andy, the door!

564
00:41:16,034 --> 00:41:17,141
- Bjorn!
- Come on, come on.

565
00:41:17,165 --> 00:41:18,365
Come on, come on, come on!

566
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:21,916
Get out of there!

567
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,220
Come on, come on,
come on!

568
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:24,789
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Go, go, go!

569
00:41:24,813 --> 00:41:26,175
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

570
00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:31,487
Go! Go!

571
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:33,815
- Bjorn, come on!
- Go! Go!

572
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,695
Andy, the door!

573
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:50,781
Stay still.
Stay still.

574
00:41:50,805 --> 00:41:52,437
I know!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

575
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,870
It's choking her.

576
00:41:56,006 --> 00:41:57,644
Stop! You gotta stop! Hey!

577
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,140
- It's choking her!
- Shit.

578
00:41:59,413 --> 00:42:00,779
Stop! Bjorn!

579
00:42:00,915 --> 00:42:02,548
Bjorn, stop!
For fuck's sake, stop!

580
00:42:02,683 --> 00:42:03,779
- Stop!
- What's it doin'?

581
00:42:03,915 --> 00:42:05,283
Is it fuckin' killin' her?

582
00:42:05,418 --> 00:42:07,699
I do not believe that's
what the creature is doing.

583
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:09,054
No.

584
00:42:09,456 --> 00:42:10,456
Andy?

585
00:42:11,753 --> 00:42:13,664
Based on the rhythmic
dilatation of those bladders,

586
00:42:13,688 --> 00:42:16,128
and its synchronization
to her breathing patterns,

587
00:42:16,264 --> 00:42:19,291
I'd surmise it's feeding her
oxygen to keep her alive.

588
00:42:19,427 --> 00:42:21,461
For what purpose,
I do not know.

589
00:42:23,066 --> 00:42:24,706
Sorry, who the fuck are you?

590
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:29,437
I'm an ND-255
Weyland-Yutani synthetic.

591
00:42:29,572 --> 00:42:32,109
Originally built for mining
and safety tasks.

592
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,248
You guys call me Andy.

593
00:42:34,383 --> 00:42:35,585
It's that module.

594
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:38,450
Yes.

595
00:42:39,748 --> 00:42:42,281
That new module didn't
just upgrade my credentials.

596
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:44,023
It substantially
updated my AI,

597
00:42:44,158 --> 00:42:47,124
and it's mending my motor
systems as we speak.

598
00:42:48,127 --> 00:42:49,993
A most overdue upgrade,
I must say.

599
00:42:50,129 --> 00:42:51,203
Shit. I'mma fucking
fry this thing.

600
00:42:51,227 --> 00:42:52,304
- Okay, wait.
- Don't!

601
00:42:52,328 --> 00:42:53,833
- Why not?
- That amount of current

602
00:42:53,968 --> 00:42:55,513
will violently
contract its tail flexors

603
00:42:55,537 --> 00:42:56,603
and will break her neck.

604
00:42:56,738 --> 00:42:57,938
So what,
you got a better idea?

605
00:42:58,038 --> 00:42:59,438
What should we
fucking do then, huh?

606
00:42:59,508 --> 00:43:01,037
Hey, hey. Hey! Hey, hey.

607
00:43:01,173 --> 00:43:03,141
Andy, do you know
how to help her?

608
00:43:04,011 --> 00:43:05,116
I'm afraid my
knowledge database

609
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,648
has not really changed.

610
00:43:06,783 --> 00:43:08,087
I do not know
what this creature is

611
00:43:08,111 --> 00:43:09,718
or how to remove it safely.

612
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,756
But there's someone
in this room who might.

613
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:47,285
I need to secure
Z-01 compound.

614
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,489
Mission's priority. All other
priorities rescinded.

615
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:51,489
Must complete the mission.

616
00:43:51,624 --> 00:43:52,790
I'm sorry...

617
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:54,527
but your mission has failed.

618
00:43:54,663 --> 00:43:56,699
What? No, I...

619
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,333
Can you tell us
what we can do to help her?

620
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:07,776
You don't help her. You run.

621
00:44:08,677 --> 00:44:10,338
Get out, however you got in.

622
00:44:10,474 --> 00:44:12,046
No, no, no.
Wait, whoa, whoa.

623
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,321
Nah, we're not fuckin' leavin'
her, okay? You understand?

624
00:44:14,345 --> 00:44:16,977
Then have mercy
and end her life now.

625
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:20,085
If not, you all die.

626
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,621
So what the fuck
is he sayin'?

627
00:44:23,757 --> 00:44:24,954
What's it doing to her?

628
00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:26,209
The parasitoid is implanting

629
00:44:26,256 --> 00:44:27,889
the Plagiarus Praepotens
in her.

630
00:44:28,024 --> 00:44:29,160
I beg your pardon?

631
00:44:29,295 --> 00:44:31,994
A seed that will amalgamate
with her DNA

632
00:44:32,129 --> 00:44:33,534
and rapidly grow out of her.

633
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,199
What's gonna grow out of her?

634
00:44:46,745 --> 00:44:49,576
XX121 Xenomorph.

635
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:51,613
One of our towing ships

636
00:44:51,749 --> 00:44:54,950
first made contact with this
specimen two decades ago.

637
00:44:55,086 --> 00:44:56,187
Of the seven crew members

638
00:44:56,322 --> 00:44:58,354
aboard the <i>USS Nostromo,</i>
only one survived,

639
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:01,224
blowing the creature
out of the airlock.

640
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,129
We've been searching
for it ever since.

641
00:45:04,264 --> 00:45:07,463
170 days ago,
our search came to an end

642
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,003
and the body of the Xenomorph
was brought on board...

643
00:45:10,572 --> 00:45:11,965
presumed dead.

644
00:45:12,101 --> 00:45:13,437
But of course,

645
00:45:13,573 --> 00:45:17,543
lack of oxygen and food is
of no true consequence to this

646
00:45:17,678 --> 00:45:18,975
perfect organism.

647
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:21,311
Yet nothing is truly immortal.

648
00:45:22,912 --> 00:45:24,213
Clearly.

649
00:45:24,348 --> 00:45:27,517
It wreaked havoc
over this station,

650
00:45:27,653 --> 00:45:30,525
until what was left of our
security forces shot it dead.

651
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,323
Only to trigger its swan song.

652
00:45:34,155 --> 00:45:35,155
Acid for blood?

653
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:37,064
Sulfuric and hydrofluoric.

654
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,039
I sealed the station back up,
but it was too late.

655
00:45:39,063 --> 00:45:40,198
Hey, shut up!

656
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:42,093
Nobody cares about your
fucking ship anymore.

657
00:45:42,131 --> 00:45:43,868
Okay, okay. Okay.

658
00:45:44,003 --> 00:45:46,037
What if we use the cryo-fuel

659
00:45:46,173 --> 00:45:48,811
to freeze
the root of the tail?

660
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:52,012
Maybe if it's frozen,
it won't choke her.

661
00:45:52,976 --> 00:45:54,278
That could work.

662
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:24,719
All right, get it off!
Get it off!

663
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,106
It's gone. It's off
of you. It's off of you.

664
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:51,202
It's off. It's off. It's off.

665
00:46:51,338 --> 00:46:53,084
You're okay. You're okay.

666
00:46:53,108 --> 00:46:54,569
I wouldn't be so sure.

667
00:46:59,945 --> 00:47:00,945
What are the odds?

668
00:47:01,081 --> 00:47:03,551
60 to 40 against your friend.

669
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,019
What are the odds on what?

670
00:47:06,486 --> 00:47:08,451
That the creature's
finished its job already.

671
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,224
What is he
talking about?

672
00:47:13,928 --> 00:47:15,260
Listen to me.

673
00:47:15,396 --> 00:47:17,994
Humans go through
too many emotional stages

674
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,131
before accepting the cold,

675
00:47:20,267 --> 00:47:22,635
yet rational - sometimes
hardest - path.

676
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:24,571
You must help them.

677
00:47:24,707 --> 00:47:25,707
You must help them.

678
00:47:30,909 --> 00:47:32,113
Andy?

679
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,060
- What's going on?
- I'm sorry

680
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:35,459
but we can't let her back
on the ship.

681
00:47:35,483 --> 00:47:37,393
- Oh, yeah? That is a problem.
- What're you doing?

682
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:38,789
- You must understand.
- You see?

683
00:47:38,813 --> 00:47:40,067
That's what I mean
by "funny ideas"!

684
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:41,889
What're you talking
about? No, he's...

685
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,589
- No! No!
- You fuckin' bitch!

686
00:47:43,724 --> 00:47:44,888
Hey! Andy! Andy!

687
00:47:45,024 --> 00:47:46,025
We're gonna go.

688
00:47:46,161 --> 00:47:47,564
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm right here.

689
00:47:47,588 --> 00:47:49,195
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

690
00:47:51,164 --> 00:47:52,309
Tyler, let's go, man! Come on!

691
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:53,408
- I'm here.
- Bjorn! No.

692
00:47:53,432 --> 00:47:55,199
Bjorn, we're not leaving
without them!

693
00:47:55,334 --> 00:47:56,683
- I'm here.
- Bjorn!

694
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,250
- Where are they?
- You need to listen.

695
00:48:00,274 --> 00:48:01,554
We have to start the ship, okay?

696
00:48:01,641 --> 00:48:02,719
- Just go and start the ship.
- Where's Rain? How...

697
00:48:02,743 --> 00:48:04,341
Forgive me.

698
00:48:04,477 --> 00:48:06,878
I've been nothing
but a burden to you.

699
00:48:07,014 --> 00:48:10,051
Today, I can finally help.

700
00:48:10,186 --> 00:48:12,647
And you won't see me
as a child anymore.

701
00:48:14,689 --> 00:48:15,689
What?

702
00:48:16,525 --> 00:48:17,525
Andy!

703
00:48:27,068 --> 00:48:28,267
- Hey!
- Bjorn!

704
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:52,995
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

705
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,793
Navarro, undock!

706
00:48:54,929 --> 00:48:56,262
<i>Undock the ship!</i>

707
00:48:58,861 --> 00:49:01,164
<i>Undocking initiated.</i>

708
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,834
<i>Please clear the airlock.</i>

709
00:49:15,918 --> 00:49:16,958
What the fuck is he doing?

710
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,295
They can't
just leave without us.

711
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,352
He thinks Andy's
trying to kill Navarro.

712
00:49:21,887 --> 00:49:23,091
What?

713
00:49:24,352 --> 00:49:25,456
Wait, is he?

714
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:30,494
I don't know.

715
00:49:33,835 --> 00:49:35,801
Andy? Andy?

716
00:49:37,169 --> 00:49:38,502
Andy, open the door.

717
00:49:44,246 --> 00:49:47,115
I'm sorry.
I couldn't stop them.

718
00:49:47,946 --> 00:49:49,051
Bjorn?

719
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,182
<i>Bjorn, what are you doing?</i>

720
00:49:50,184 --> 00:49:51,344
<i>You can't just leave us here.</i>

721
00:49:51,386 --> 00:49:52,750
<i>You gotta come back
and get us.</i>

722
00:49:52,885 --> 00:49:55,321
Sorry, I can't do that until
she turns that psychopath off.

723
00:49:57,519 --> 00:49:58,660
What's going on?

724
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,095
Andy, uh...

725
00:50:01,428 --> 00:50:04,163
- Andy, he's glitchy.
- What?

726
00:50:04,299 --> 00:50:05,508
I just need
to get away

727
00:50:05,532 --> 00:50:07,212
from this airlock right now.
I just need...

728
00:50:09,035 --> 00:50:10,035
Navarro?

729
00:50:10,168 --> 00:50:12,006
Are you all right?

730
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:13,509
What's wrong?
What do you need?

731
00:50:20,046 --> 00:50:21,248
Navarro?

732
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:31,124
Oh, God.

733
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,128
Oh, my God,
what is that?

734
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:37,994
Navarro, please.
Navarro! Navarro!

735
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:39,535
Hey, hey, hey.

736
00:50:40,864 --> 00:50:42,784
I don't know what to do,
I'm sorry. I don't know.

737
00:50:48,576 --> 00:50:49,915
Someone talk to me!

738
00:50:49,939 --> 00:50:52,081
Kay, Bjorn, Navarro,
what's going on?

739
00:51:02,516 --> 00:51:03,521
Help!

740
00:51:04,289 --> 00:51:05,754
- Help!
- Kay!

741
00:51:06,923 --> 00:51:09,626
What's happening?
What's happening?

742
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:14,103
Please don't let me die.

743
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,840
Someone help!

744
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,471
Bjorn?

745
00:53:04,846 --> 00:53:05,846
Kay?

746
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,516
We have to go get them.

747
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:13,046
<i>T-minus-47
minutes to impact event.</i>

748
00:53:14,551 --> 00:53:15,553
Doesn't make any sense.

749
00:53:15,688 --> 00:53:17,259
No, I thought you said
we had hours.

750
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,074
The explosion pushed
the station's axis off

751
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:20,593
by a few degrees,

752
00:53:20,728 --> 00:53:23,162
just enough to hit the
asteroid belt a lot sooner.

753
00:53:23,297 --> 00:53:24,695
Where did they crash?

754
00:53:25,463 --> 00:53:26,463
Romulus Hangar Bay,

755
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,740
on the other side
of the station.

756
00:53:27,764 --> 00:53:29,128
- Okay.
- Let's go.

757
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,614
<i>T-minus-45
minutes to impact event.</i>

758
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:50,050
Mother. What's the integrity
of Compound Z-01?

759
00:53:56,494 --> 00:53:58,025
There's still hope.

760
00:54:06,407 --> 00:54:07,603
We need to find a way

761
00:54:07,738 --> 00:54:09,278
to cross
to the Romulus module.

762
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:19,013
No, no, no.

763
00:54:19,148 --> 00:54:21,015
They must've spread
from the lab.

764
00:54:24,493 --> 00:54:25,925
I don't see
another way.

765
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,329
Andy, can...

766
00:54:31,061 --> 00:54:32,732
I heard your voice
in my head.

767
00:54:32,868 --> 00:54:34,159
Calling.

768
00:54:34,294 --> 00:54:37,337
ND-255
artificial person.

769
00:54:37,473 --> 00:54:39,205
Your model
was once the backbone

770
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,968
of our colonization efforts,

771
00:54:41,104 --> 00:54:42,936
and it's an honor to be
in your presence.

772
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:45,204
Please allow me
to introduce myself.

773
00:54:45,973 --> 00:54:48,008
I'm Science Officer Rook,

774
00:54:48,144 --> 00:54:51,011
and I humbly request
your services now.

775
00:54:51,147 --> 00:54:53,855
I'm afraid I have
just one directive.

776
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:57,150
To do what's best for...

777
00:54:58,286 --> 00:55:01,094
Your upgrade came
with a new directive.

778
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:02,760
It overrides the old one.

779
00:55:03,492 --> 00:55:04,531
I see.

780
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,392
What's required of me...

781
00:55:07,661 --> 00:55:08,970
Sir?

782
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,603
To finish our mission.

783
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:20,140
- Andy!
- Andy!

784
00:55:21,246 --> 00:55:22,182
Andy.

785
00:55:22,184 --> 00:55:23,848
My apologies.

786
00:55:23,983 --> 00:55:26,249
I was consulting my friend
about our situation.

787
00:55:26,384 --> 00:55:27,389
Follow me.

788
00:55:28,921 --> 00:55:30,561
What? Our situation?
How do you...

789
00:55:30,685 --> 00:55:32,658
Andy! Andy!

790
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:42,728
The parasitoids
have no eyes.

791
00:55:42,864 --> 00:55:44,371
They track you by sound,

792
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,466
but primarily,
by heat signature.

793
00:55:46,601 --> 00:55:47,641
What?

794
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,404
Your body temperature.

795
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,610
Right.

796
00:55:50,745 --> 00:55:52,408
If we raise the temperature
in the room

797
00:55:52,544 --> 00:55:53,777
to match our bodies,

798
00:55:53,912 --> 00:55:55,951
would that make us
invisible to them?

799
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,716
If we're quiet enough?

800
00:55:58,551 --> 00:56:00,213
Just one way to find out.

801
00:56:07,688 --> 00:56:08,694
Hey.

802
00:56:11,596 --> 00:56:13,028
This is all my fault.

803
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:17,230
Yeah, it is.

804
00:56:19,267 --> 00:56:21,707
Yours, mine,
and everyone else's.

805
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:26,481
We all decided
to do this together.

806
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:32,388
We'll get to them.

807
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:40,286
<i>T-minus
40 minutes to impact event.</i>

808
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:12,559
The hallway's
temperature

809
00:57:12,658 --> 00:57:13,958
is now equal to your bodies,

810
00:57:14,093 --> 00:57:16,059
so the creatures should not
be able to see you.

811
00:57:16,195 --> 00:57:19,826
But stress, fear, panic will
spike your temperature

812
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:21,431
and you'll be exposed.

813
00:57:21,566 --> 00:57:23,165
Sweat, goosebumps.

814
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,600
That's your skin trying to
cool your body down.

815
00:57:25,736 --> 00:57:27,267
So watch out for those.

816
00:57:28,037 --> 00:57:31,139
Now, stay calm and stay quiet.

817
01:00:26,284 --> 01:00:28,618
Come on. Come on!

818
01:00:28,753 --> 01:00:32,221
Come on! Come on!

819
01:00:41,403 --> 01:00:42,765
Okay. Okay.

820
01:00:42,901 --> 01:00:45,102
Bjorn, let's go. Let's go.

821
01:00:57,681 --> 01:00:58,881
Fuck!

822
01:00:59,017 --> 01:01:00,348
Stay back, stay back, please.

823
01:01:05,326 --> 01:01:06,354
Fuck!

824
01:01:09,727 --> 01:01:11,223
No! Fuck!

825
01:01:46,568 --> 01:01:47,568
<i>Tyler.</i>

826
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:50,305
<i>Come on.</i>

827
01:01:57,644 --> 01:01:58,644
Kay...

828
01:02:00,848 --> 01:02:02,177
Oh, my God, Tyler...

829
01:02:02,313 --> 01:02:04,585
Kay, I'm here. I'm here.

830
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,821
<i>Please, Tyler, help me.</i>

831
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:09,153
<i>Everyone's dead.
I can't open this door.</i>

832
01:02:09,555 --> 01:02:10,555
Please.

833
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,038
The lever
with the red button,

834
01:02:18,062 --> 01:02:19,592
there's a key to the left.

835
01:02:21,536 --> 01:02:22,536
<i>Help.</i>

836
01:02:22,668 --> 01:02:23,805
I can't find it.

837
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:25,661
There's not a key.
There isn't a key, Tyler.

838
01:02:27,771 --> 01:02:29,619
<i>It'll be
there. It has to be there.</i>

839
01:02:29,643 --> 01:02:31,307
A key. Okay, okay.

840
01:02:42,424 --> 01:02:44,122
Uh...

841
01:02:50,865 --> 01:02:52,493
I have the key.
I have the key.

842
01:02:57,571 --> 01:02:58,602
Oh, my God.

843
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:20,994
Run.

844
01:03:22,123 --> 01:03:23,595
Go! Go!

845
01:03:47,753 --> 01:03:48,982
Wait!

846
01:03:49,118 --> 01:03:50,322
Wait!

847
01:03:50,858 --> 01:03:52,751
Come on!

848
01:04:01,333 --> 01:04:03,437
You almost closed
the door on him.

849
01:04:03,572 --> 01:04:06,268
Yes, but I didn't.

850
01:04:06,404 --> 01:04:07,841
I calculated
the timing perfectly

851
01:04:07,976 --> 01:04:09,537
with more success
than last time.

852
01:04:10,677 --> 01:04:11,677
Won't you agree?

853
01:04:12,813 --> 01:04:14,414
We're getting close.

854
01:04:14,549 --> 01:04:16,581
Let's move.

855
01:04:16,716 --> 01:04:22,253
<i>T-minus
30 minutes to impact event.</i>

856
01:06:48,797 --> 01:06:51,006
<i>Access denied.</i>

857
01:06:56,376 --> 01:06:58,409
Kay...

858
01:06:59,544 --> 01:07:00,860
We're here. We're here.
It's all right,

859
01:07:00,884 --> 01:07:01,991
it's all right,
it's all right.

860
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,183
Andy, open the door.

861
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:04,712
It's all right.

862
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:07,184
We're gonna get you out.

863
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:08,655
Tyler,
open the door.

864
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,355
Open the door. Come on.

865
01:07:11,858 --> 01:07:12,984
Oh, my God.

866
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:14,605
Look at me. Kay,
Kay, Kay. Look at me.

867
01:07:14,629 --> 01:07:15,833
- Andy, open the door.
- Kay, look at me. Look at me.

868
01:07:15,857 --> 01:07:17,033
It's all right.
I'm gonna get you out.

869
01:07:17,057 --> 01:07:18,508
Andy, open the door.
Stop fucking around.

870
01:07:18,532 --> 01:07:19,938
- What are you doing?
- Don't look

871
01:07:19,962 --> 01:07:22,236
- over there. Andy.
- Tyler, what's wrong?

872
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,331
Hey, I need you to open
that door right now, okay?

873
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:27,304
That's what the creature's
waiting for us to do.

874
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,977
Open it, please.

875
01:07:30,113 --> 01:07:31,356
Andy.
Andy, open the door.

876
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,587
Listen to me.
Listen to me. She's pregnant.

877
01:07:32,611 --> 01:07:35,313
Just, please.
Guys, please. Come on.

878
01:07:35,448 --> 01:07:37,241
She's gonna
have a baby. Okay?

879
01:07:37,377 --> 01:07:39,331
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- It takes that door

880
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:40,662
two seconds to open,
another two to fully close.

881
01:07:40,686 --> 01:07:43,222
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

882
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:44,767
Come on,
what are you doing? Please...

883
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:47,018
That's plenty of time for the
creature to get in here.

884
01:07:47,154 --> 01:07:49,593
Please, please,
please open the door.

885
01:07:49,728 --> 01:07:52,025
- Why won't you help me?
- Listen, listen.

886
01:07:52,161 --> 01:07:53,572
- Come on, help me, please.
- You have to run right now.

887
01:07:53,596 --> 01:07:54,716
- Please, please.
- Run. Run.

888
01:07:54,798 --> 01:07:55,915
You're one of us, man.
You're one of us!

889
01:07:55,939 --> 01:07:57,161
Kay, it's the only way.

890
01:07:57,297 --> 01:07:58,514
- Open the fucking door. Andy!
- You have to

891
01:07:58,538 --> 01:07:59,713
- fucking run. All right?
- Andy, please!

892
01:07:59,737 --> 01:08:00,812
- It's the only way.
- Andy!

893
01:08:00,836 --> 01:08:02,112
- You have to run!
- Please!

894
01:08:02,136 --> 01:08:04,111
Open the fucking...

895
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:07,346
Kay! Kay!

896
01:08:08,475 --> 01:08:09,746
No, no, no.

897
01:08:09,882 --> 01:08:11,086
Kay!

898
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:23,231
I'll open it.

899
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,424
She's all right. She's moving.

900
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,300
No. It's all right.

901
01:08:34,573 --> 01:08:36,802
Andy,
open the door, please.

902
01:08:36,937 --> 01:08:39,576
Andy, I need to go
and get her.

903
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,106
I'm truly sorry.

904
01:08:42,242 --> 01:08:44,022
There was nothing I could
have done to save her.

905
01:08:44,046 --> 01:08:46,677
You could have opened
the fucking door!

906
01:08:46,813 --> 01:08:48,585
We'd all be dead if I had.

907
01:08:50,787 --> 01:08:52,103
We need to move
before the creature

908
01:08:52,127 --> 01:08:53,352
finds its way into this room.

909
01:08:53,488 --> 01:08:54,525
Andy...

910
01:08:56,691 --> 01:08:59,024
what's your prime directive?

911
01:09:00,367 --> 01:09:02,337
I'm afraid
I have a new directive.

912
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:05,464
To do what's best
for the company.

913
01:09:07,703 --> 01:09:10,302
I need to remove that module.

914
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:13,214
I'm afraid that's not in the
best interest of the company.

915
01:09:19,986 --> 01:09:21,321
We need to move.

916
01:09:22,185 --> 01:09:23,191
Now.

917
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:34,664
How could you do that?

918
01:09:35,869 --> 01:09:37,029
What?

919
01:09:37,665 --> 01:09:39,372
Leave someone behind?

920
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:45,279
Where are we going?

921
01:09:47,109 --> 01:09:50,250
To finish a task Rook
has entrusted upon me.

922
01:09:50,385 --> 01:09:52,253
When completed,
he'll clear the <i>Corbelan</i>

923
01:09:52,389 --> 01:09:55,081
for departure and open
the docking bay doors.

924
01:09:55,216 --> 01:09:57,617
You will be free to continue
to Yvaga together.

925
01:09:57,752 --> 01:09:59,617
And I'll return to Jackson.

926
01:09:59,753 --> 01:10:00,987
And stay in Jackson.

927
01:10:04,995 --> 01:10:07,730
That is, assuming
we make it out of here alive.

928
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,039
We're here.

929
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:47,034
<i>Romulus Beta Lab.</i>

930
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:52,247
<i>All personnel require
A-1 security clearance.</i>

931
01:10:54,148 --> 01:10:55,349
What is that?

932
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:58,519
Probably some fucked up
bio-weapon, I'm sure.

933
01:10:58,655 --> 01:11:00,575
<i>Actually, quite the opposite.</i>

934
01:11:02,156 --> 01:11:03,881
<i>Andy, tell them.</i>

935
01:11:04,017 --> 01:11:05,718
<i>Tell them what I told you.</i>

936
01:11:05,854 --> 01:11:07,253
Our colonies are dying.

937
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:10,727
Unbearable temperatures,
novel diseases every cycle.

938
01:11:11,461 --> 01:11:12,597
Toxic mine fumes.

939
01:11:12,733 --> 01:11:15,570
It's all one unforeseen
tragedy after the other.

940
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:19,172
<i>Mankind was never truly suited
for space colonization.</i>

941
01:11:19,307 --> 01:11:21,606
<i>They're simply too fragile.</i>

942
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:24,477
<i>They're too weak.</i>

943
01:11:26,042 --> 01:11:28,409
The work of this station
aimed to change that.

944
01:11:28,545 --> 01:11:30,010
"The perfect organism."

945
01:11:30,145 --> 01:11:32,243
That's how we should
refer to human beings.

946
01:11:33,288 --> 01:11:36,915
<i>So, I set this wrong right.</i>

947
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:40,328
<i>I took its gift for humanity.</i>

948
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:45,163
Inside the parasitoids
I bioengineered

949
01:11:45,299 --> 01:11:46,796
from the Xenomorph's DNA,

950
01:11:46,931 --> 01:11:49,337
I discovered a unique
non-Newtonian fluid.

951
01:11:50,037 --> 01:11:52,066
<i>Life.</i>

952
01:11:52,201 --> 01:11:55,739
<i>In its most primal,
unadulterated form.</i>

953
01:11:55,874 --> 01:11:57,410
<i>This microorganism
can be the most</i>

954
01:11:57,546 --> 01:12:00,371
<i>destructive pathogen
ever observed.</i>

955
01:12:00,506 --> 01:12:03,349
<i>But acetylated
and synthesized in our lab,</i>

956
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:04,977
<i>I've turned it
into the miracle</i>

957
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:07,487
<i>Mr. Weyland died
searching for.</i>

958
01:12:08,517 --> 01:12:10,083
Prometheus fire.

959
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:14,054
The divine gift to humanity.

960
01:12:15,596 --> 01:12:18,299
<i>Z-01 contains
the genome responsible</i>

961
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:20,258
<i>for the Xeno's ability
to accelerate</i>

962
01:12:20,393 --> 01:12:22,965
<i>and slow down
its metabolism at will.</i>

963
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,230
<i>Its symbiotic capableness
easily rewrites</i>

964
01:12:26,365 --> 01:12:28,376
<i>the host's DNA
through its blood.</i>

965
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:35,879
<i>This is a much needed and well
overdue upgrade for humanity.</i>

966
01:12:36,014 --> 01:12:39,583
<i>We simply cannot wait
for evolution anymore.</i>

967
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:42,181
Yeah, can we
get out of here now?

968
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:44,036
My mission is to take
this back to the colony

969
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,382
for further development.

970
01:12:46,152 --> 01:12:47,725
Rook is tracking the compound.

971
01:12:48,693 --> 01:12:49,893
When detected inside our ship,

972
01:12:49,927 --> 01:12:51,192
he'll open
the docking bay doors

973
01:12:51,327 --> 01:12:53,327
and set the hauler on
autopilot back to the colony.

974
01:12:54,628 --> 01:12:55,634
Wait.

975
01:12:58,436 --> 01:12:59,473
Do you see it?

976
01:13:04,011 --> 01:13:05,675
There.

977
01:13:05,811 --> 01:13:07,415
The fucking thing's
huntin' us.

978
01:13:08,744 --> 01:13:11,208
Right. New plan.

979
01:13:11,344 --> 01:13:12,750
Can you manage yourself
with a gun?

980
01:13:14,618 --> 01:13:16,347
Yes, I fucking can.

981
01:13:22,322 --> 01:13:24,564
Right, this is an
F44AA pulse rifle.

982
01:13:24,699 --> 01:13:26,730
It's rotating breech,
electronic pulse action.

983
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:28,213
It's what the
Colonial Marines used.

984
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:29,964
AA stands for Aiming Assist.

985
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:31,769
So, right,
you put that under your arm.

986
01:13:34,972 --> 01:13:36,609
That's it.
Right, this hand here.

987
01:13:39,778 --> 01:13:41,510
All right.
Aim it towards Andy.

988
01:13:41,646 --> 01:13:42,747
Pull the trigger halfway.

989
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,244
Don't worry, the safety's on.

990
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:51,057
See?

991
01:13:51,192 --> 01:13:52,821
Aiming assistance.

992
01:13:52,957 --> 01:13:54,322
If that thing
comes towards you,

993
01:13:54,457 --> 01:13:56,891
you point it in its general
direction, you'll never miss.

994
01:13:57,027 --> 01:13:59,060
- Where'd you learn all this?
- Uh...

995
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:02,193
Games and magazines.

996
01:14:02,328 --> 01:14:04,663
You've just got one mag.
That's it.

997
01:14:04,798 --> 01:14:06,199
450 rounds.

998
01:14:06,334 --> 01:14:08,300
And you mustn't fire
a single one.

999
01:14:09,773 --> 01:14:12,306
Acid for blood. Remember?

1000
01:14:13,209 --> 01:14:15,041
We're on the bottom floor
of the station.

1001
01:14:15,176 --> 01:14:16,874
Below our feet
is the vacuum of space.

1002
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:18,244
You shoot that creature

1003
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:21,049
and it's a guaranteed
instant decompression.

1004
01:14:21,518 --> 01:14:22,622
And we all die.

1005
01:14:22,757 --> 01:14:24,097
So what's the point
in giving us the guns?

1006
01:14:24,121 --> 01:14:25,986
Because the creature
may see it as a threat,

1007
01:14:26,122 --> 01:14:28,562
and maybe won't charge at us
dead on.

1008
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:30,392
Maybe.

1009
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,666
Big maybe.

1010
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:34,535
I found us a way
through the conveyor belt.

1011
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:36,361
This way.

1012
01:14:39,799 --> 01:14:41,135
Andy.

1013
01:14:42,639 --> 01:14:44,072
Are you there?

1014
01:15:15,737 --> 01:15:21,109
<i>T-minus
20 minutes to impact event.</i>

1015
01:15:32,686 --> 01:15:34,791
There's a lift
at the end of this corridor.

1016
01:15:34,927 --> 01:15:36,762
It will take us
directly to our ship.

1017
01:15:49,535 --> 01:15:51,376
There's more
of those things.

1018
01:15:51,511 --> 01:15:53,176
Yeah, that's not good.

1019
01:15:53,312 --> 01:15:55,748
They seem to have been
here for quite some time.

1020
01:16:03,323 --> 01:16:04,323
Andy?

1021
01:16:23,774 --> 01:16:25,613
Jesus Christ.

1022
01:16:30,343 --> 01:16:32,246
Busy little creatures.

1023
01:16:44,526 --> 01:16:46,926
I think we better go back
and find another way.

1024
01:16:47,062 --> 01:16:48,702
That might be a good idea.

1025
01:16:51,136 --> 01:16:52,675
Andy,
see if you can open this gate.

1026
01:16:52,699 --> 01:16:54,539
Stop.

1027
01:16:56,068 --> 01:16:57,304
What?

1028
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:11,256
Kay!

1029
01:17:11,391 --> 01:17:12,850
Hey!

1030
01:17:12,985 --> 01:17:14,189
Tyler!

1031
01:17:15,361 --> 01:17:16,361
Tyler!

1032
01:17:16,495 --> 01:17:17,495
Kay!

1033
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:21,333
Kay!

1034
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:27,438
Kay!

1035
01:17:40,486 --> 01:17:41,486
Kay!

1036
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:43,515
I got her, I got her.

1037
01:17:46,858 --> 01:17:48,689
It's all right. We got you.

1038
01:17:48,824 --> 01:17:50,126
She's alive.

1039
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:00,314
Okay, we got you,
we got you.

1040
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,868
Hold on.

1041
01:18:02,004 --> 01:18:03,068
Okay.

1042
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:07,891
We're here,
we're here.

1043
01:18:07,915 --> 01:18:09,278
Tyler, she's losing
a lot of blood.

1044
01:18:09,414 --> 01:18:11,609
Maybe that's why
she hasn't been implanted yet.

1045
01:18:12,718 --> 01:18:13,785
How do you know?

1046
01:18:13,921 --> 01:18:16,350
There's no dead
parasitoid by her feet.

1047
01:18:16,485 --> 01:18:18,616
Andy, this is on you.
So you do something.

1048
01:18:19,526 --> 01:18:21,091
Please! Andy!

1049
01:18:25,727 --> 01:18:29,061
25% of the human genome
is shared with rats.

1050
01:18:29,197 --> 01:18:30,771
And it worked on the rat.

1051
01:18:35,609 --> 01:18:36,609
Come on, Kay.

1052
01:18:39,909 --> 01:18:41,007
Don't.

1053
01:18:41,142 --> 01:18:42,409
What choice do I have?

1054
01:18:43,179 --> 01:18:44,379
We take her back to the hauler

1055
01:18:44,446 --> 01:18:46,213
and we put her
in the cryo-pod. Okay?

1056
01:18:46,349 --> 01:18:47,869
That will keep her alive
long enough to

1057
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:49,718
get her proper treatment
back at the colony.

1058
01:18:49,854 --> 01:18:51,489
I don't trust this.

1059
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:52,753
Andy, will she make it?

1060
01:18:52,888 --> 01:18:54,355
If we hurry.

1061
01:19:13,745 --> 01:19:14,745
Go! Go!

1062
01:19:21,689 --> 01:19:22,729
I see it. I see it.

1063
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:24,058
This is it,
this is it.

1064
01:19:24,124 --> 01:19:25,956
I got her.
I got her. I got her.

1065
01:19:26,092 --> 01:19:27,792
You're okay.
You're okay.

1066
01:19:27,927 --> 01:19:29,764
We're so close.
We're so close.

1067
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:33,933
Hey. Hey, you're okay.

1068
01:19:34,068 --> 01:19:36,502
Hey, we're almost there.
We're almost there.

1069
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:37,638
You see, you're so close.

1070
01:19:37,772 --> 01:19:39,301
You just gotta hang in there.

1071
01:19:43,511 --> 01:19:44,644
Watch out!

1072
01:19:50,045 --> 01:19:51,045
Tyler?

1073
01:19:51,148 --> 01:19:52,743
Tyler!

1074
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:24,581
Is that all you got?
Is that all you got?

1075
01:20:31,388 --> 01:20:32,828
Andy!

1076
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,298
No! Tyler!

1077
01:21:51,906 --> 01:21:55,039
Kay, Kay, listen to me, okay?

1078
01:21:55,175 --> 01:21:57,043
This goes
straight to our ship.

1079
01:21:57,178 --> 01:22:00,311
I need you to take this.
And get into a cryo-pod.

1080
01:22:00,446 --> 01:22:03,214
And autopilot will fly you
back to our colony.

1081
01:22:04,343 --> 01:22:05,715
Can you do that?

1082
01:22:08,819 --> 01:22:09,819
Yes?

1083
01:22:09,953 --> 01:22:11,420
What about you?

1084
01:22:12,628 --> 01:22:14,159
I'll find a way back.

1085
01:24:08,942 --> 01:24:10,407
Let me take it out.

1086
01:24:11,275 --> 01:24:13,344
And I'll fix you in return.

1087
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:19,713
Listen to me.

1088
01:24:20,546 --> 01:24:22,219
You'll die in here

1089
01:24:22,355 --> 01:24:23,722
and that's not
in the best interest

1090
01:24:23,858 --> 01:24:26,258
of the company or mine.

1091
01:24:58,519 --> 01:25:02,459
Come on. Andy, please.

1092
01:25:04,996 --> 01:25:10,261
<i>T-minus
10 minutes to impact event.</i>

1093
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:11,402
Rain?

1094
01:25:15,907 --> 01:25:17,111
Andy.

1095
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:21,544
- I'm so, so sorry.
- No, no.

1096
01:25:22,113 --> 01:25:25,119
No, I'm sorry.

1097
01:25:44,338 --> 01:25:46,305
It won't
hold them off for long.

1098
01:26:12,832 --> 01:26:14,628
Come on.

1099
01:26:14,764 --> 01:26:16,004
<i>You're
wasting your time.</i>

1100
01:26:16,103 --> 01:26:18,502
Hey. Hey. Please help us.

1101
01:26:20,468 --> 01:26:21,802
Open the door.

1102
01:26:21,938 --> 01:26:24,004
<i>I'm afraid
I must deny your petition.</i>

1103
01:26:24,139 --> 01:26:26,480
<i>I just can't risk
compromising the compound.</i>

1104
01:26:26,615 --> 01:26:28,974
<i>But know that I'm grateful
for the invaluable help</i>

1105
01:26:29,109 --> 01:26:30,712
<i>you two have provided
to the company.</i>

1106
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:34,320
Son of a bitch!

1107
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:41,588
Andy, open it.

1108
01:26:41,724 --> 01:26:42,844
- Here.
- Open.

1109
01:26:43,626 --> 01:26:44,742
It's not working.

1110
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:45,923
God damn it!

1111
01:26:52,231 --> 01:26:54,766
<i>I can't lie
about your chances,</i>

1112
01:26:54,901 --> 01:26:56,540
<i>but you have my sympathies.</i>

1113
01:27:16,090 --> 01:27:17,621
<i>Press it,</i>

1114
01:27:17,756 --> 01:27:20,267
<i>so I can take control of your
ship and fly you out of here.</i>

1115
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:24,363
Who are you?

1116
01:27:24,499 --> 01:27:25,602
<i>A friend.</i>

1117
01:27:27,366 --> 01:27:30,404
<i>Your companions died
so you could live.</i>

1118
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:32,069
<i>Press the button...</i>

1119
01:27:32,204 --> 01:27:34,204
<i>and let me
honor their sacrifice.</i>

1120
01:27:43,183 --> 01:27:46,018
Andy, can you tell me
one of your jokes?

1121
01:27:48,053 --> 01:27:49,895
Why don't monsters eat clowns?

1122
01:27:52,567 --> 01:27:55,058
- 'Cause they taste funny.
- They taste funny.

1123
01:27:55,193 --> 01:27:57,337
I don't understand
cloning at all.

1124
01:27:58,237 --> 01:27:59,603
That makes two of us.

1125
01:28:00,937 --> 01:28:03,575
I read a great book
about zero gravity.

1126
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:06,104
- I just couldn't put it down.
- Couldn't put it down.

1127
01:28:08,948 --> 01:28:10,141
Rain?

1128
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:11,719
Rain?

1129
01:28:12,714 --> 01:28:14,319
Rain, what are you doing?

1130
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:16,147
I'm turning off
the gravity generator.

1131
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:21,926
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven,</i>

1132
01:28:22,062 --> 01:28:24,292

<i>four, three,</i>

1134
01:28:26,561 --> 01:28:28,226
<i>two, one.</i>

1135
01:28:35,034 --> 01:28:36,640
Rain, are you sure about this?

1136
01:28:37,706 --> 01:28:39,339
Only one way to find out.

1137
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,046
It works.

1138
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:07,704
Rain! You're at 40%.

1139
01:29:19,019 --> 01:29:20,149
20%.

1140
01:29:31,365 --> 01:29:33,532
Rain!

1141
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:45,511
Oh, fuck.

1142
01:29:53,713 --> 01:29:55,213
Stay behind me.

1143
01:30:00,754 --> 01:30:01,758
Andy, be careful.

1144
01:30:27,482 --> 01:30:29,049
Rain!

1145
01:30:45,666 --> 01:30:47,100
Andy, you okay?

1146
01:30:53,106 --> 01:30:55,075
We need
to get to the elevator.

1147
01:31:09,157 --> 01:31:11,491
The elevator won't work
without gravity.

1148
01:31:28,512 --> 01:31:29,516
Ready?

1149
01:31:39,559 --> 01:31:41,451
Rain!

1150
01:31:52,931 --> 01:31:54,607
Fuck.

1151
01:32:09,287 --> 01:32:10,287
No.

1152
01:32:21,292 --> 01:32:22,701
It's a gravity purge!

1153
01:32:33,410 --> 01:32:34,572
Andy!

1154
01:32:34,708 --> 01:32:35,708
Come on.

1155
01:33:57,088 --> 01:33:58,088
Andy!

1156
01:34:29,022 --> 01:34:30,228
Get away from her.

1157
01:34:36,061 --> 01:34:38,265
You bitch.

1158

What took you so long?

1166
01:35:22,649 --> 01:35:24,014
Let's get you outta here.

1167
01:35:25,150 --> 01:35:27,248
<i>I'm glad to see
you two made it.</i>

1168
01:36:25,374 --> 01:36:26,736
I got you.
Watch your head.

1169
01:36:28,510 --> 01:36:31,147
- Thank you.
- You're gonna be just fine.

1170
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,149
Both of you.

1171
01:36:42,557 --> 01:36:44,457
<i>The company
couldn't be prouder</i>

1172
01:36:44,592 --> 01:36:46,800
<i>of what's been
accomplished here today.</i>

1173
01:36:46,935 --> 01:36:48,865
<i>I've sent
a message back to HQ.</i>

1174
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,120
<i>When received in six months,</i>

1175
01:36:50,202 --> 01:36:51,699
<i>they'll travel
to Jackson's Star</i>

1176
01:36:51,835 --> 01:36:54,116
<i>to retrieve the compound from
you for further development.</i>

1177
01:37:00,208 --> 01:37:01,474
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1178
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:04,213
Change of plans.

1179
01:37:06,377 --> 01:37:08,619
<i>Andy, stop her.</i>

1180
01:37:08,754 --> 01:37:10,219
<i>Reconnect us now.</i>

1181
01:37:12,961 --> 01:37:14,521
<i>No, no, no.
You two cannot do this.</i>

1182
01:37:14,657 --> 01:37:16,929
<i>The compound must be delivered
to the company.</i>

1183
01:37:17,065 --> 01:37:19,226
<i>I'm afraid

1184
01:37:19,362 --> 01:37:21,297
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

1185
01:37:21,432 --> 01:37:23,697
Now you better listen to me
here, now, you two.

1186
01:37:23,832 --> 01:37:27,203
You are insignificant in the
great scheme of things. You...

1187
01:37:33,875 --> 01:37:35,079
No.

1188
01:37:49,924 --> 01:37:53,097
This will keep your systems
online until we get to Yvaga.

1189
01:37:54,936 --> 01:37:56,934
- But I thought that...
- I don't care.

1190
01:37:57,070 --> 01:37:59,070
You're coming with me.
All right?

1191
01:38:00,337 --> 01:38:02,139
If that's
what's best for Rain.

1192
01:38:04,770 --> 01:38:06,770
Andy, I have
a new directive for you.

1193
01:38:08,682 --> 01:38:10,345
Do what's best for us.

1194
01:38:13,816 --> 01:38:15,020
Done.

1195
01:38:16,324 --> 01:38:17,324
Good.

1196
01:38:37,510 --> 01:38:38,510

Oh, no, no.

1200
