1
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:37,372
Papa!

2
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,872
While I'm very familiar
with your and your family,

3
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:44,527
I have no way of knowing
if you are familiar

4
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:46,355
with who I am.

5
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:48,357
Are you aware
of my existence?

6
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:50,533
Yes.

7
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:52,056
This is good.

8
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,710
Are you aware
of the job

9
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:56,128
I've been ordered
to carry out in France?

10
00:07:58,522 --> 00:07:59,847
Yes.

11
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:02,414
Please tell me
what you've heard.

12
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:04,416
I've heard

13
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,071
that the Fuhrer
has put you in charge

14
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:09,291
of rounding up
the Jews left in France

15
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:12,337
who are either hiding
or passing for Gentile.

16
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:16,191
The Fuhrer couldn't have
said it better himself.

17
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:22,434
But the meaning
of your visit...

18
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,480
Pleasant,
though it is...

19
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,309
Is mysterious to me.

20
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,355
The Germans looked
through my house

21
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,879
nine months ago
for hiding Jews...

22
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:32,967
and found nothing.

23
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:35,099
Yeah.

24
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:36,666
I'm aware of that.

25
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,955
I've read the reports
of this area.

26
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:44,109
But like any enterprise,

27
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,720
when under new management,

28
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:49,114
there's always a slight
duplication of efforts.

29
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:51,987
Most of it being
a complete waste of time.

30
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:54,293
But needs to be done nevertheless.

31
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:57,973
I just have a few questions,
Monsieur LaPadite.

32
00:08:59,714 --> 00:09:01,953
If you can assist me
with the answers,

33
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:04,893
my department can
close a file on your family.

34
00:09:13,728 --> 00:09:15,077
Now...

35
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:19,057
before the occupation
there were...

36
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:21,320
four Jewish families
in this area.

37
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:24,086
All dairy farmers
like yourself.

38
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:29,502
The Doleracs, the Rollins,

39
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:31,722
the Loveitts

40
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:33,506
and the Dreyfuses.

41
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,247
Is that correct?

42
00:09:35,271 --> 00:09:38,381
To my knowledge,
those were the Jewish families

43
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:40,078
among the dairy farmers.

44
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:42,733
Herr Colonel,
would it disturb you

45
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:44,300
if I smoked my pipe?

46
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:46,041
Please,
Monsieur LaPadite.

47
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:49,000
This is your house.
Make yourself comfortable.

48
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:52,482
Now according
to these papers,

49
00:09:52,506 --> 00:09:55,267
all the Jewish families
in this area

50
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,140
have been accounted
for except...

51
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,490
the Dreyfuses.

52
00:10:00,514 --> 00:10:02,492
Somewhere in the last year

53
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:04,320
it would appear
they have vanished,

54
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:06,235
which leads me
to the conclusion

55
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:08,106
that they've either
made good their escape

56
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,979
or someone is very
successfully hiding them.

57
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:14,983
What have you heard about the
Dreyfuses, Monsieur LaPadite?

58
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:16,593
Only rumors.

59
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,377
I love rumors.

60
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:21,163
Facts can be
so misleading,

61
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,599
where rumors...
True or false,

62
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,296
are often revealing.

63
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,733
So Monsieur LaPadite,

64
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:27,822
what rumors
have you heard

65
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:29,499
regarding
the Dreyfuses?

66
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:35,657
Again, this is just a rumor,

67
00:10:35,681 --> 00:10:38,137
but we heard...

68
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:39,835
the Dreyfuses...

69
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:43,123
had made their way
into Spain.

70
00:10:49,738 --> 00:10:52,499
So the rumors you've heard
have been of escape?

71
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:53,544
<i>Oui.</i>

72
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:55,178
Uh, Yes.

73
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,725
Having never met
the Dreyfuses,

74
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:04,555
would you confirm for me the
exact members of the household

75
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:06,146
and their names?

76
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,718
There were
five of them.

77
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:16,567
Um, the father,

78
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,874
Jacob.

79
00:11:18,898 --> 00:11:21,050
Wife...

80
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:22,945
Miriam.

81
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:27,186
And her brother...

82
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,604
Bob.

83
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:36,611
How old is Bob?

84
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:40,136
30, 31.

85
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:45,291
Continue.

86
00:11:45,315 --> 00:11:47,903
And the children...

87
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:50,320
Amos...

88
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,194
and Shosanna.

89
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,154
Ages of the children?

90
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:06,835
Uh, Amos was...

91
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,991
nine or 10?

92
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:12,754
And Shosanna?

93
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:15,669
And Shosanna was...

94
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,498
18 or 19.

95
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:21,351
I'm not really sure.

96
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:33,712
I guess
that should do it.

97
00:12:39,762 --> 00:12:41,740
However, before I go,

98
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:44,506
could I have another glass
of your delicious milk?

99
00:12:47,204 --> 00:12:48,902
LaPadite:
But of course.

100
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:57,103
Monsieur LaPadite,

101
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:58,670
are you aware
of the nickname

102
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,001
the people of France
have given me?

103
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:07,616
I have no interest
in such things.

104
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,838
But you are aware
of what they call me.

105
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:15,406
I'm aware.

106
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:18,932
What are you
aware of then?

107
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,134
<i>Merci.</i>

108
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:30,658
That they call you
the "Jew Hunter."

109
00:13:30,682 --> 00:13:32,206
Precisely.

110
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:36,882
I understand your
trepidation in repeating it.

111
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:39,711
Heydrich apparently
hates the moniker

112
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,148
the good people of Prague
have bestowed on him.

113
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:43,802
Actually,
why he would hate

114
00:13:43,826 --> 00:13:46,022
the name "The Hangman"
is baffling to me.

115
00:13:46,046 --> 00:13:49,155
It would appear he's done
everything in his power to earn it.

116
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:52,419
I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title,

117
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:55,205
precisely because
I've earned it.

118
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:59,731
The feature that makes me such
an effective hunter of the Jews is,

119
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,212
as opposed
to most German soldiers,

120
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:05,780
I can think
like a Jew...

121
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,783
where they can only
think like a German.

122
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,680
More precisely,
German soldier.

123
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,317
Now if one were to
determine what attribute

124
00:14:20,341 --> 00:14:22,754
the German people
share with a beast,

125
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,367
it would be the cunning and
the predatory instinct of a hawk.

126
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:29,718
But if one were to
determine what attributes

127
00:14:29,742 --> 00:14:31,633
the Jews share
with the beast,

128
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:33,790
it would be that
of the rat.

129
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,075
The Fuhrer
and Goebbels' propaganda

130
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:40,033
have said pretty much
the same thing.

131
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:42,514
But where our
conclusions differ

132
00:14:42,538 --> 00:14:46,281
is I don't consider
the comparison an insult.

133
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,739
Consider for a moment

134
00:14:50,763 --> 00:14:53,003
the world a rat
lives in.

135
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:55,638
It's a hostile world, indeed.

136
00:14:56,944 --> 00:14:58,617
If a rat were
to scamper

137
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:00,314
through your
front door right now,

138
00:15:00,338 --> 00:15:02,273
would you greet it
with hostility?

139
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:05,580
I suppose I would.

140
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,148
Has a rat ever done
anything to you to create

141
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:10,044
this animosity
you feel toward them?

142
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:12,544
Rats spread disease.

143
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:14,198
They bite people.

144
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:16,417
Rats were the cause
of the bubonic plague.

145
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:18,115
But that's
some time ago.

146
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:21,031
I propose to you any
disease a rat could spread,

147
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:22,989
a squirrel
could equally carry.

148
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:24,817
Would you agree?

149
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,166
<i>Oui.</i>

150
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,994
Yet I assume
you don't share

151
00:15:28,018 --> 00:15:29,953
the same animosity
with squirrels

152
00:15:29,977 --> 00:15:31,911
you do with rats,
do you?

153
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:35,132
- No.
- Yet they're both rodents, are they not?

154
00:15:35,156 --> 00:15:38,550
Except for the tail, they even
rather look alike, don't they?

155
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:41,834
It's an interesting
thought, Herr Colonel.

156
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:45,751
However interesting
as the thought may be,

157
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:48,908
it makes not one bit of
difference to how you feel.

158
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,238
If a rat were to walk
in here right now,

159
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:55,500
as I'm talking,

160
00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:57,719
would you greet it

161
00:15:57,743 --> 00:15:59,852
with a saucer
of your delicious milk?

162
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,028
Probably not.

163
00:16:02,052 --> 00:16:03,749
I didn't think so.

164
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:06,467
You don't like them.

165
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:08,817
You don't really know
why you don't like them,

166
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:12,865
all you know is
you find them repulsive.

167
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,781
Consequently,
a German soldier

168
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:19,828
conducts a search of a house
suspected of hiding Jews.

169
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:21,526
Where does
the hawk look?

170
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,877
He looks in the barn,
he looks in the attic,

171
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,183
he looks
in the cellar...

172
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:28,316
He looks everywhere
he would hide.

173
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,884
But there's so many places
it would never occur

174
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,997
to a hawk to hide.

175
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:36,542
However, the reason
the Fuhrer's

176
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:38,631
brought me
off my Alps in Austria

177
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,763
and placed me in French
cow country today

178
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:43,244
is because it does
occur to me.

179
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,204
Because I'm aware
of what tremendous feats

180
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:49,753
human beings are capable
of once they abandon dignity.

181
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:54,342
May I smoke
my pipe as well?

182
00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:56,605
P-Please, Herr Colonel,

183
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:58,544
make yourself
at home.

184
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:12,732
Now...

185
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:17,476
my job dictates...

186
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,092
that I must have
my men enter your home...

187
00:17:28,444 --> 00:17:30,465
and conduct
a thorough search

188
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:34,991
before I can officially cross
your family's name off my list.

189
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:37,603
If there are any
irregularities to be found,

190
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:39,126
rest assured,
they will be.

191
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,259
That is, unless you have
something to tell me

192
00:17:41,283 --> 00:17:44,175
that makes the conducting
of a search unnecessary.

193
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:46,916
I might add, also,
that any information

194
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,615
that makes the performance
of my duty easier

195
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:51,791
will not be met
with punishment.

196
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:53,706
Actually,
quite the contrary...

197
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,577
It will be met
with reward.

198
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:58,319
That reward will be
your family

199
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,842
will cease
to be harassed

200
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:01,670
in any way
by the German military

201
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:04,654
during the rest of our
occupation of your country.

202
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,842
You are sheltering enemies
of the state, are you not?

203
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:25,763
Yes.

204
00:18:27,852 --> 00:18:29,221
You're sheltering them

205
00:18:29,245 --> 00:18:31,812
underneath your floorboards,
aren't you?

206
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,730
Yes.

207
00:18:38,254 --> 00:18:40,908
Point out to me the areas
where they're hiding.

208
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,343
Since I haven't heard
any disturbance,

209
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:06,040
I assume while they
are listening,

210
00:19:06,064 --> 00:19:07,848
they don't speak English.

211
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:10,895
Yes.

212
00:19:12,288 --> 00:19:14,222
I'm going to switch back
to French now,

213
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:16,224
and I want you to follow
my masquerade,

214
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:17,312
is that clear?

215
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:19,643
Yes.

216
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:13,958
Shh!

217
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,490
It's the girl.

218
00:21:09,362 --> 00:21:12,974
<i>Au revoir,
Shosanna!</i>

219
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:29,208
Ten-hut!

220
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,671
My name is
Lieutenant Aldo Raine,

221
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:39,629
and I'm putting together
a special team,

222
00:21:39,653 --> 00:21:41,327
and I need me
eight soldiers.

223
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:45,418
Eight Jewish
American soldiers.

224
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:47,028
Now y'all might've
heard rumors

225
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:48,943
about the armada
happening soon.

226
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:53,382
Well, we'll be leaving
a little earlier.

227
00:21:53,406 --> 00:21:56,733
We're gonna be dropped into
France dressed as civilians.

228
00:21:56,757 --> 00:22:00,215
Once we're in enemy territory,

229
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:02,391
as a bushwhacking
guerilla army,

230
00:22:02,415 --> 00:22:04,175
we're gonna be doing
one thing,

231
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,263
and one thing only...

232
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:08,421
Killing Nazis.

233
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:11,139
I don't know
about y'all,

234
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,229
but I sure as hell
didn't come down

235
00:22:13,253 --> 00:22:14,491
from the goddamn
smoky mountains,

236
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:16,275
cross 5000 miles
of water,

237
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:18,365
fight my way
through half of Sicily,

238
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:20,367
and jump out
of a fucking airplane

239
00:22:20,391 --> 00:22:22,456
to teach the Nazis
lessons in humanity.

240
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,981
Nazi ain't got
no humanity.

241
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:28,200
They're the foot soldiers
of a Jew-hating,

242
00:22:28,224 --> 00:22:29,419
mass-murdering maniac,

243
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:31,247
and they need
to be destroyed.

244
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:34,250
That's why any and every
son of a bitch we find

245
00:22:34,274 --> 00:22:36,426
wearing a Nazi uniform,

246
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,930
they're gonna die.

247
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,302
I'm the direct descendent

248
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:45,130
of the mountain man
Jim Bridger.

249
00:22:45,154 --> 00:22:47,219
That means I got
a little Indian in me.

250
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:49,178
Our battle plan

251
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:52,050
will be that
of an Apache resistance.

252
00:22:52,074 --> 00:22:54,749
We will be cruel
to the Germans.

253
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,709
Through our cruelty,
they will know who we are.

254
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:01,277
They will find
the evidence of our cruelty

255
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:03,453
in the disemboweled, dismembered

256
00:23:03,477 --> 00:23:06,282
and disfigured bodies of their
brothers we leave behind us.

257
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:09,416
And the German won't be able
to help themselves

258
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,982
but imagine the cruelty

259
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:13,550
their brothers endured
at our hands,

260
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:15,465
and our boot heels,

261
00:23:15,489 --> 00:23:18,816
and the edge
of our knives.

262
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,166
And the German
will be sickened by us.

263
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,168
And the German will
talk about us.

264
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:25,867
And the German
will fear us.

265
00:23:25,891 --> 00:23:28,347
When the German closes
their eyes at night,

266
00:23:28,371 --> 00:23:30,306
and they're tortured
by their subconscious

267
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,829
for the evil
they have done,

268
00:23:31,853 --> 00:23:33,744
it will be
with thoughts of us

269
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:35,944
that they are
tortured with.

270
00:23:37,076 --> 00:23:38,619
Sound good?

271
00:23:38,643 --> 00:23:40,708
Yes, sir!

272
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:43,275
That's what I
like to hear.

273
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:45,277
But I got a word
of warning

274
00:23:45,301 --> 00:23:47,062
for all you
would-be warriors...

275
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:48,803
When you join my command,

276
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,239
you take on debit.

277
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:54,983
That debit you owe me... personally.

278
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:57,289
Each and every man
under my command

279
00:23:57,313 --> 00:24:00,205
owes me 100 Nazi scalps.

280
00:24:00,229 --> 00:24:02,860
And I want my scalps.

281
00:24:02,884 --> 00:24:06,342
And all y'all will get me
100 Nazi scalps

282
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:08,866
taken from the heads
of 100 dead Nazis,

283
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,591
or you will die trying.

284
00:26:53,448 --> 00:26:56,296
Hey, Hirschberg.

285
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,429
Send that Kraut
sarge over.

286
00:26:58,453 --> 00:27:00,890
You, go.

287
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,771
Sergeant
Werner Rachtmann.

288
00:27:35,795 --> 00:27:39,688
Lieutenant Aldo Raine,
pleased to meet you.

289
00:27:39,712 --> 00:27:41,646
You know what sit down
means, Werner?

290
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,995
Yes.

291
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:44,238
Then sit down.

292
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:48,958
How's your English,
Werner?

293
00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:51,743
'Cause need be, we got a
couple fellas can translate.

294
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,397
Wicki there...

295
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,573
An Austrian Jew who
got the fuck out of Munich

296
00:27:55,597 --> 00:27:57,531
while the getting was good,
became American.

297
00:27:57,555 --> 00:28:00,447
Got drafted, come back
to give y'all what for.

298
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:03,582
Another one up there
you might be familiar with,

299
00:28:03,606 --> 00:28:05,651
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.

300
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:09,283
Heard of him?

301
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:13,224
Everybody in the German army
has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.

302
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:25,430
<i>The reason for
Hugo Stiglitz's</i>

303
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,606
<i>celebrity among
German soldiers is simple.</i>

304
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,782
<i>As a German enlisted man,</i>

305
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:33,723
<i>he killed 13
Gestapo officers.</i>

306
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:50,455
<i>Instead of putting him
up against the wall,</i>

307
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:53,632
<i>the high command decided
to send him back to Berlin</i>

308
00:28:53,656 --> 00:28:55,440
<i>to be made an example of.</i>

309
00:28:56,746 --> 00:28:58,332
<i>Needless to say,</i>

310
00:28:58,356 --> 00:29:00,334
<i>once the Basterds
heard about him,</i>

311
00:29:00,358 --> 00:29:02,447
<i>he never got there.</i>

312
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,486
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?

313
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,249
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.

314
00:29:45,273 --> 00:29:46,598
These are the Basterds.

315
00:29:46,622 --> 00:29:50,123
Ever heard of us?

316
00:29:50,147 --> 00:29:53,518
We just wanted to say
we're a big fan of your work.

317
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,761
When it comes
to killing Nazis...

318
00:29:57,633 --> 00:29:59,742
I think you show
great talent.

319
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:02,900
I pride myself in having
an eye for that kind of talent.

320
00:30:06,686 --> 00:30:10,536
But your status as a
Nazi killer is still amateur.

321
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,564
We all come here to
see if you want to go pro.

322
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,462
Can I assume you know
who we are?

323
00:30:23,486 --> 00:30:24,985
You're Aldo
the Apache.

324
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:27,074
Hey!

325
00:30:27,098 --> 00:30:28,989
Werner, if you
heard of us,

326
00:30:29,013 --> 00:30:31,905
you probably heard we ain't
in the prisoner taking business.

327
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:33,733
We in the killing
Nazi business.

328
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:35,909
And cousin,
business is a-booming.

329
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:37,389
Oh, yeah.

330
00:30:37,413 --> 00:30:39,913
That leaves two ways
we can play this out.

331
00:30:39,937 --> 00:30:42,133
Either kill you
or let you go.

332
00:30:42,157 --> 00:30:45,179
Whether or not you're
gonna leave this ditch alive

333
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:47,466
depends entirely
on you.

334
00:30:50,905 --> 00:30:53,579
Up the road a piece
there's an orchard.

335
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:56,669
Besides you,
we know there's another

336
00:30:56,693 --> 00:30:59,541
Kraut patrol fucking
around here somewhere.

337
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:02,240
If that patrol were
to have any crack shots,

338
00:31:02,264 --> 00:31:05,199
that orchard would be
a goddamn sniper's delight.

339
00:31:05,223 --> 00:31:08,333
So if you ever
want to eat

340
00:31:08,357 --> 00:31:10,161
a sauerkraut
sandwich again,

341
00:31:10,185 --> 00:31:13,120
you gotta show me
on this here map

342
00:31:13,144 --> 00:31:14,687
where they are.

343
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:17,255
You gotta tell me
how many they are,

344
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,735
and you gotta tell me
what kinda artillery

345
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:20,891
they're carrying
with 'em.

346
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:24,915
You can't expect me
to divulge information

347
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:26,829
that would put
German lives in danger.

348
00:31:26,853 --> 00:31:29,310
Well, now, Werner,

349
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:32,009
that's where you're wrong.
That's exactly what I expect.

350
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:34,925
I need to know about Germans
hiding in trees.

351
00:31:34,949 --> 00:31:36,752
And you need to tell me.

352
00:31:36,776 --> 00:31:39,059
And you need
to tell me right now.

353
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:41,018
Just take
that finger of yours

354
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:42,889
and point out
on this here map

355
00:31:42,913 --> 00:31:44,369
where this party's
being held.

356
00:31:44,393 --> 00:31:45,761
How many is a-coming,

357
00:31:45,785 --> 00:31:48,005
and what they brought
to play with.

358
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,470
I respectfully
refuse, sir.

359
00:31:57,494 --> 00:32:01,213
Hear that?

360
00:32:01,237 --> 00:32:03,195
Yes.

361
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,263
That's Sergeant
Donny Donowitz.

362
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:11,005
You might know him
better by his nickname...

363
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,008
"The Bear Jew."

364
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,010
If you heard
of Aldo the Apache,

365
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,186
you gotta have heard
about the Bear Jew.

366
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,188
I heard
of the Bear Jew.

367
00:32:20,212 --> 00:32:21,798
What did you hear?

368
00:32:21,822 --> 00:32:24,888
Beats German soldiers
with a club.

369
00:32:24,912 --> 00:32:27,500
He bashes their brains in
with a baseball bat

370
00:32:27,524 --> 00:32:29,328
is what he does.

371
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:31,808
Werner, I'm gonna ask you
one last goddamn time,

372
00:32:31,832 --> 00:32:33,462
and if you still
respectfully refuse,

373
00:32:33,486 --> 00:32:35,334
I'm calling
the Bear Jew over.

374
00:32:35,358 --> 00:32:37,684
He's gonna take
that big bat of his

375
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:40,537
and he's gonna beat
your ass to death with it.

376
00:32:44,193 --> 00:32:45,909
Now take your wiener-schnitzel-
looking finger

377
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:48,980
and point out on this map
what I want to know.

378
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:58,879
Fuck you,

379
00:32:58,903 --> 00:33:01,036
and your Jew dogs!

380
00:33:04,604 --> 00:33:06,626
Actually, we're all tickled
to hear you say that.

381
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,454
Quite frankly, watching
Donny beat Nazis to death

382
00:33:08,478 --> 00:33:10,847
is the closest we ever
get to going to the movies.

383
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:13,154
- Donny!
- Yeah?

384
00:33:13,178 --> 00:33:16,790
We got us a German here who
wants to die for country. Oblige him.

385
00:34:22,901 --> 00:34:25,140
Did you get that
for killing Jews?

386
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:27,514
Bravery.

387
00:34:47,055 --> 00:34:50,015
Oh, no!

388
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:57,433
About now, I'd be shitting
my pants if I was you.

389
00:34:57,457 --> 00:35:00,262
Teddy fucking Williams
knocks it out of the park!

390
00:35:00,286 --> 00:35:04,005
Fenway Park is on its feet
for Teddy fucking Ballgame!

391
00:35:04,029 --> 00:35:05,789
He went yard
on that one!

392
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:07,835
On to fucking
Landsdowne Street!

393
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:10,992
You!

394
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:13,580
Damn it, Hirschberg.

395
00:35:13,604 --> 00:35:15,625
Donny, bring that
other one over here.

396
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:17,149
Alive!

397
00:35:17,173 --> 00:35:19,977
Get the fuck up!
Batter up! You're on deck!

398
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:22,700
Two hits... I hit you,
you hit the ground.

399
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:25,940
- English?
- <i>Nein.</i>

400
00:35:25,964 --> 00:35:27,139
Wicki.

401
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:32,990
Ask him if he
wants to live.

402
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:35,428
<i>Ja,</i> sir.

403
00:35:35,452 --> 00:35:38,237
Tell him to point out on this
map the German position.

404
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:44,591
Ask him
how many Germans.

405
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,398
Round about 12.

406
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:49,858
What kind of artillery?

407
00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:03,152
When you report
what happened here,

408
00:36:03,176 --> 00:36:06,199
you can't tell 'em
you told us what you told us.

409
00:36:06,223 --> 00:36:08,288
They'll shoot you.
They're gonna want to know

410
00:36:08,312 --> 00:36:10,768
why are you so special
we let you live.

411
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:13,249
So tell 'em
we let you live

412
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:15,382
so you could spread
the word through the ranks

413
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,669
what's gonna happen
to every Nazi we find.

414
00:36:39,952 --> 00:36:41,538
Now that you
survived the war,

415
00:36:41,562 --> 00:36:43,695
when you get home
what you gonna do?

416
00:36:49,527 --> 00:36:51,268
He's gonna hug
his mother.

417
00:36:52,573 --> 00:36:55,160
Well, ain't that nice.

418
00:36:55,184 --> 00:36:57,926
Ask if he's gonna
take off his uniform.

419
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,995
He's gonna burn it.

420
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:06,259
That's what
we thought.

421
00:37:06,283 --> 00:37:07,825
We don't like that.

422
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:10,567
See, we like our Nazis
in uniforms.

423
00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:12,308
That way you
can spot 'em...

424
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:14,203
Just like that.

425
00:37:18,512 --> 00:37:20,316
Once you take off
that uniform,

426
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,231
ain't nobody gonna know
you's a Nazi.

427
00:37:22,255 --> 00:37:24,475
That don't sit
well with us.

428
00:37:30,394 --> 00:37:34,006
So I'm gonna give you a little
something you can't take off.

429
00:37:45,975 --> 00:37:47,257
You know, Lieutenant,

430
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:50,216
you're getting
pretty good at that.

431
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,156
You know how you get to
Carnegie Hall, don't you?

432
00:37:54,288 --> 00:37:56,116
Practice.

433
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:23,445
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

434
00:44:01,136 --> 00:44:03,573
<i>Hallo, Hallo, Hallo,
Frederick Zoller.</i>

435
00:44:29,164 --> 00:44:31,427
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

436
00:44:36,084 --> 00:44:37,476
<i>Au revoir.</i>

437
00:46:37,946 --> 00:46:39,948
<i>Au revoir.</i>

438
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:20,847
<i>Au revoir,
Shosanna!</i>

439
01:02:34,823 --> 01:02:36,235
<i>At that time,</i>

440
01:02:36,259 --> 01:02:38,019
<i>35 millimeter
nitrate film</i>

441
01:02:38,043 --> 01:02:40,065
<i>was so flammable</i>

442
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,502
<i>that you couldn't even
bring a reel onto a streetcar.</i>

443
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:44,547
You can't bring those
there in a public vehicle.

444
01:02:44,571 --> 01:02:46,158
- They're films, ain't they?
- Yes.

445
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:47,768
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.

446
01:02:47,792 --> 01:02:49,465
<i>Because nitrate film</i>

447
01:02:49,489 --> 01:02:52,101
<i>burns three times faster
than paper.</i>

448
01:02:54,668 --> 01:02:57,386
<i>Shosanna has a collection</i>

449
01:02:57,410 --> 01:03:03,548
<i>of over 350
nitrate film prints.</i>

450
01:04:13,444 --> 01:04:15,663
Right this way, Lieutenant.

451
01:04:36,597 --> 01:04:38,706
Lieutenant Archie Hicox
reporting, sir.

452
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:40,360
General Ed Fenech.

453
01:04:40,384 --> 01:04:42,188
At ease, Hicox.

454
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:45,278
Drink?

455
01:04:45,302 --> 01:04:47,541
If you offer me
a scotch and plain water,

456
01:04:47,565 --> 01:04:49,456
I could drink a scotch
and plain water.

457
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,153
Thattaboy, Lieutenant.

458
01:04:51,177 --> 01:04:53,503
Make it yourself
like a good chap, will you?

459
01:04:53,527 --> 01:04:55,529
The bar's
in the globe.

460
01:04:59,534 --> 01:05:02,339
Something
for yourself, sir?

461
01:05:02,363 --> 01:05:03,993
Whisky, straight.

462
01:05:04,017 --> 01:05:06,953
No junk in it.

463
01:05:06,977 --> 01:05:09,433
It says here that you
speak German fluently.

464
01:05:09,457 --> 01:05:11,958
Like a Katzenjammer kid.

465
01:05:11,982 --> 01:05:14,308
And your occupation
before the war?

466
01:05:14,332 --> 01:05:15,962
I'm a film critic.

467
01:05:15,986 --> 01:05:17,746
List your accomplishments.

468
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:19,400
Well, sir,

469
01:05:19,424 --> 01:05:21,837
such as they are, I
write reviews and articles

470
01:05:21,861 --> 01:05:24,622
for a publication called
"Films and Filmmakers."

471
01:05:24,646 --> 01:05:26,755
And I've had
two books published.

472
01:05:26,779 --> 01:05:28,191
Hmm, impressive.

473
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,671
Don't be modest, Lieutenant,

474
01:05:29,695 --> 01:05:31,020
what are
their titles?

475
01:05:31,044 --> 01:05:32,674
The first book
was called,

476
01:05:32,698 --> 01:05:34,719
"Art of the Eyes,
the Heart and the Mind:

477
01:05:34,743 --> 01:05:37,113
A study of German
cinema in the '20s."

478
01:05:37,137 --> 01:05:40,725
The second one was called,
"24 Frame da Vinci."

479
01:05:40,749 --> 01:05:43,163
It's a subtextual
film criticism study

480
01:05:43,187 --> 01:05:46,514
of the work of German
director G.W. Pabst.

481
01:05:46,538 --> 01:05:48,081
What shall
we drink to, sir?

482
01:05:48,105 --> 01:05:49,560
Well, um...

483
01:05:49,584 --> 01:05:52,607
down with Hitler.

484
01:05:52,631 --> 01:05:54,609
All the way
down, sir.

485
01:05:54,633 --> 01:05:56,330
Yes. Yes.

486
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:05,402
Are you familiar with German
cinema under the Third Reich?

487
01:06:05,426 --> 01:06:08,275
Yes, obviously I haven't
seen any of the films

488
01:06:08,299 --> 01:06:09,841
made in the last
three years,

489
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:11,930
but I'm familiar
with it.

490
01:06:11,954 --> 01:06:13,497
Explain it to me.

491
01:06:13,521 --> 01:06:15,021
Pardon, sir?

492
01:06:15,045 --> 01:06:16,674
Well, this little
escapade of ours

493
01:06:16,698 --> 01:06:19,329
requires a knowledge
of the German film industry

494
01:06:19,353 --> 01:06:20,852
under the Third Reich.

495
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:24,837
Explain to me
UFA under Goebbels.

496
01:06:26,404 --> 01:06:29,078
Goebbels considers
the films he's making

497
01:06:29,102 --> 01:06:32,081
to be the beginning of a
new era in German cinema,

498
01:06:32,105 --> 01:06:34,649
an alternative
to what he considers

499
01:06:34,673 --> 01:06:37,869
the Jewish-German
intellectual cinema of the '20s

500
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:40,829
and the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.

501
01:06:40,853 --> 01:06:43,353
How's he
doing?

502
01:06:43,377 --> 01:06:46,052
Frightfully. Sorry,
sir. Once again?

503
01:06:46,076 --> 01:06:49,098
You say he wants to
take on the Jews

504
01:06:49,122 --> 01:06:51,318
at their own game.

505
01:06:51,342 --> 01:06:53,234
Well,
compared to, say,

506
01:06:53,258 --> 01:06:55,584
Louis B. Mayer,

507
01:06:55,608 --> 01:06:57,586
how's he doing?

508
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:59,501
Quite well, actually.

509
01:06:59,525 --> 01:07:01,459
Since Goebbels
has taken over,

510
01:07:01,483 --> 01:07:03,635
film attendance has
steadily risen in Germany

511
01:07:03,659 --> 01:07:05,942
over the last
eight years.

512
01:07:05,966 --> 01:07:07,552
But Louis B. Mayer
wouldn't be

513
01:07:07,576 --> 01:07:09,511
Goebbels' proper
opposite number.

514
01:07:09,535 --> 01:07:11,121
I believe Goebbels
sees himself

515
01:07:11,145 --> 01:07:13,800
closer to
David O. Selznick.

516
01:07:17,586 --> 01:07:19,390
Brief him.

517
01:07:19,414 --> 01:07:21,131
Lieutenant Hicox,

518
01:07:21,155 --> 01:07:22,828
at this point in time,
I'd like to brief you

519
01:07:22,852 --> 01:07:24,743
on Operation Kino.

520
01:07:24,767 --> 01:07:26,441
Three days from now,

521
01:07:26,465 --> 01:07:28,269
Joseph Goebbels is
throwing a gala premiere

522
01:07:28,293 --> 01:07:30,662
of one of his new movies
in Paris.

523
01:07:30,686 --> 01:07:34,579
- What film, sir?
- The motion picture is called "Nation's Pride."

524
01:07:34,603 --> 01:07:38,931
In attendance at this
joyous Germatic occasion

525
01:07:38,955 --> 01:07:41,282
will be Goebbels,
Goring, Bormann,

526
01:07:41,306 --> 01:07:43,501
and most of
the German High Command,

527
01:07:43,525 --> 01:07:45,286
including all
high-ranking officers

528
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:47,462
of both the SS
and the Gestapo,

529
01:07:47,486 --> 01:07:50,160
as well as luminaries of the
Nazi propaganda film industry.

530
01:07:50,184 --> 01:07:53,337
The master race
at play, eh?

531
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:55,557
Basically, we have
all our rotten eggs

532
01:07:55,581 --> 01:07:57,211
in one basket.

533
01:07:57,235 --> 01:08:00,692
The objective
of Operation Kino...

534
01:08:00,716 --> 01:08:02,564
blow up
the basket.

535
01:08:02,588 --> 01:08:05,915
And like the snows
of yesteryear,

536
01:08:05,939 --> 01:08:08,222
gone from
this earth.

537
01:08:08,246 --> 01:08:10,093
Jolly good, sir.

538
01:08:10,117 --> 01:08:12,617
An American
Secret Service outfit

539
01:08:12,641 --> 01:08:14,402
that lives
deep behind enemy lines

540
01:08:14,426 --> 01:08:16,186
will be your assist.

541
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:20,016
The Germans call them
the Basterds.

542
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,105
- The Basterds?
- Yeah.

543
01:08:22,129 --> 01:08:23,585
Never
heard of them.

544
01:08:23,609 --> 01:08:25,108
Whole point
of the Secret Service,

545
01:08:25,132 --> 01:08:26,588
old boy, you not
hearing of them.

546
01:08:26,612 --> 01:08:28,329
But the Jerries
have heard of them

547
01:08:28,353 --> 01:08:30,200
because these Yanks
have been them the devil.

548
01:08:30,224 --> 01:08:32,681
You'll be dropped
into France,

549
01:08:32,705 --> 01:08:35,814
about 24 kilometers
outside of Paris.

550
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:37,686
The Basterds will be
waiting for you.

551
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:39,383
First thing, you'll
go to a little village

552
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:41,080
called Nadine.

553
01:08:41,104 --> 01:08:43,648
In Nadine, there's a
tavern called La Louisiane.

554
01:08:43,672 --> 01:08:45,694
There you'll rendezvous
with our double agent.

555
01:08:45,718 --> 01:08:47,783
She'll take you
from there.

556
01:08:47,807 --> 01:08:49,960
She's the one who's going
to get you into the premiere.

557
01:08:49,984 --> 01:08:53,572
It will be you, her, and two
German-born members of the Basterds.

558
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:56,009
She's also made
all the other arrangements

559
01:08:56,033 --> 01:08:57,272
you're going to need.

560
01:08:57,296 --> 01:08:59,230
How will I know her?

561
01:08:59,254 --> 01:09:01,735
I suspect that won't be
too much trouble for you.

562
01:09:03,345 --> 01:09:06,455
Your contact is
Bridget von Hammersmark.

563
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,935
Bridget von Hammersmark?

564
01:09:08,959 --> 01:09:12,200
The German movie star
is working for England?

565
01:09:12,224 --> 01:09:14,985
Yes, for the last
two years now.

566
01:09:15,009 --> 01:09:17,335
One could even say
that Operation Kino

567
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:18,684
is her brain child.

568
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:19,903
Indeed.

569
01:09:19,927 --> 01:09:21,078
Got the gist?

570
01:09:21,102 --> 01:09:22,688
Well, I think so, sir.

571
01:09:22,712 --> 01:09:24,671
Paris when it sizzles.

572
01:09:27,761 --> 01:09:31,219
You didn't say the goddamn
rendezvous was in a fucking basement.

573
01:09:31,243 --> 01:09:32,829
I didn't know.

574
01:09:32,853 --> 01:09:34,439
It said it was
in a tavern.

575
01:09:34,463 --> 01:09:37,268
- It is a tavern.
- Yeah. In a basement.

576
01:09:37,292 --> 01:09:40,489
You know, fighting in a
basement offers a lot of difficulties,

577
01:09:40,513 --> 01:09:44,101
number one being you're
fighting in a basement.

578
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:45,885
What if we go in there
and she's not even there?

579
01:09:45,909 --> 01:09:49,149
We wait.
Don't worry.

580
01:09:49,173 --> 01:09:50,803
She's a British spy.

581
01:09:50,827 --> 01:09:52,612
She'll make
the rendezvous.

582
01:10:13,589 --> 01:10:15,219
Stiglitz, right?

583
01:10:15,243 --> 01:10:17,114
That's right, sir.

584
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:20,117
I hear you're
pretty good with that.

585
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,753
You know, we're not
looking for trouble right now,

586
01:10:27,777 --> 01:10:30,278
simply making contact
with our agent.

587
01:10:30,302 --> 01:10:32,976
Should be uneventful.

588
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,717
However,

589
01:10:34,741 --> 01:10:36,371
the off chance
I'm wrong,

590
01:10:36,395 --> 01:10:39,330
things prove eventful,

591
01:10:39,354 --> 01:10:41,748
I need to know
we can all remain calm.

592
01:10:46,884 --> 01:10:49,147
I don't look
calm to you?

593
01:10:51,498 --> 01:10:54,239
Well, now that you
put it like that...

594
01:10:55,719 --> 01:10:57,199
I guess you do.

595
01:11:11,561 --> 01:11:14,932
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz,

596
01:11:14,956 --> 01:11:19,023
he's not exactly
the loquacious type, is he?

597
01:11:19,047 --> 01:11:21,112
Is that the kind
of man you need?

598
01:11:21,136 --> 01:11:23,138
Loquacious type?

599
01:11:24,574 --> 01:11:29,294
Fair point, Lieutenant.

600
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,209
So, you all
get in trouble in there,

601
01:11:31,233 --> 01:11:32,602
what are we
supposed to do,

602
01:11:32,626 --> 01:11:35,779
make bets on
how it call comes out?

603
01:11:35,803 --> 01:11:37,433
If we get into trouble,

604
01:11:37,457 --> 01:11:40,218
we can handle it.

605
01:11:40,242 --> 01:11:41,915
But if trouble
does happen,

606
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:43,569
we need you
to make damn sure

607
01:11:43,593 --> 01:11:45,702
no Germans, or French,
for that matter,

608
01:11:45,726 --> 01:11:48,487
escape from
that basement.

609
01:11:48,511 --> 01:11:51,664
If Frau von Hammersmark's
cover is compromised,

610
01:11:51,688 --> 01:11:53,405
the mission is kaput.

611
01:11:53,429 --> 01:11:56,277
Speaking of
Frau von Hammersmark,

612
01:11:56,301 --> 01:11:58,889
whose idea was it for
the death-trap rendezvous?

613
01:11:58,913 --> 01:12:00,978
She chose the spot.

614
01:12:01,002 --> 01:12:03,241
Oh, isn't that
just dandy?

615
01:12:03,265 --> 01:12:05,852
Look. She's not
a military strategist.

616
01:12:05,876 --> 01:12:07,506
She's just
an actress.

617
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:09,508
Well, you don't got to
be Stonewall Jackson

618
01:12:09,532 --> 01:12:11,292
to know you don't want
to fight in a basement.

619
01:12:11,316 --> 01:12:13,425
She wasn't picking
a place to fight.

620
01:12:13,449 --> 01:12:15,296
She was picking
a place isolated

621
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,018
and without Germans.

622
01:15:25,164 --> 01:15:27,210
Eric, <i>merci beaucoup.</i>

623
01:28:00,447 --> 01:28:01,622
<i>Nein.</i>

624
01:31:45,674 --> 01:31:48,391
Well, if this is it,
old boy...

625
01:31:48,415 --> 01:31:51,070
I hope you don't mind if I
go out speaking the kings.

626
01:31:52,463 --> 01:31:54,683
By all means, Captain.

627
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:01,796
There's a special rung
in hell

628
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:05,278
reserved for people
who waste good scotch.

629
01:32:05,302 --> 01:32:08,393
Seeing as I may be
rapping on the door momentarily...

630
01:32:13,485 --> 01:32:15,637
I must say...

631
01:32:15,661 --> 01:32:17,489
damn good stuff, sir.

632
01:32:20,318 --> 01:32:23,669
Now,
about this pickle...

633
01:32:24,888 --> 01:32:26,672
we find ourselves in.

634
01:32:28,587 --> 01:32:30,173
It would appear
that there's only

635
01:32:30,197 --> 01:32:31,653
one thing left
for you to do.

636
01:32:31,677 --> 01:32:34,569
And what
would that be?

637
01:32:34,593 --> 01:32:37,596
- Stiglitz.
- Say <i>auf Weidersehen to your Nazi balls.</i>

638
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:15,871
You outside!
Who are you?

639
01:33:15,895 --> 01:33:18,787
British?
American?

640
01:33:18,811 --> 01:33:20,571
What?

641
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:22,008
We're American.

642
01:33:22,032 --> 01:33:23,792
What are you?

643
01:33:23,816 --> 01:33:26,142
I'm a German,
you idiot!

644
01:33:26,166 --> 01:33:28,797
You speak English
pretty good for a German.

645
01:33:28,821 --> 01:33:30,693
I agree.

646
01:33:31,868 --> 01:33:33,347
So, let's talk.

647
01:33:34,305 --> 01:33:35,978
Okay, talk.

648
01:33:36,002 --> 01:33:37,612
I'm a father.

649
01:33:39,049 --> 01:33:42,376
My baby was born
today in Frankfurt

650
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,291
five hours ago.

651
01:33:44,315 --> 01:33:45,858
His name is Max.

652
01:33:45,882 --> 01:33:49,078
We were in here
drinking, celebrating.

653
01:33:49,102 --> 01:33:50,514
They're the ones
that came in

654
01:33:50,538 --> 01:33:51,820
shooting and killing.

655
01:33:51,844 --> 01:33:53,213
It's not my fault!

656
01:33:53,237 --> 01:33:55,456
Okay,
it wasn't your fault.

657
01:33:56,675 --> 01:33:58,392
What's your name, soldier?

658
01:33:58,416 --> 01:34:00,176
Wilhelm.

659
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:01,700
Now...

660
01:34:01,724 --> 01:34:04,137
is there anybody
alive on our side?

661
01:34:04,161 --> 01:34:06,120
- No!
- I'm alive!

662
01:34:07,556 --> 01:34:09,210
Who's that?

663
01:34:12,561 --> 01:34:14,302
Is the girl
on your side?

664
01:34:15,826 --> 01:34:17,412
Which girl?

665
01:34:17,436 --> 01:34:18,761
Who do you
think?

666
01:34:18,785 --> 01:34:20,937
Von Hammersmark.

667
01:34:20,961 --> 01:34:24,617
Yeah, she's ours.
Is she okay?

668
01:34:27,968 --> 01:34:29,361
Wilhelm!

669
01:34:30,318 --> 01:34:31,755
She's been shot!

670
01:34:33,017 --> 01:34:34,472
But she's alive.

671
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:36,150
No.

672
01:34:38,326 --> 01:34:40,435
Okay, Wilhelm.

673
01:34:40,459 --> 01:34:42,896
What do you say
we make us a deal?

674
01:34:44,768 --> 01:34:46,223
What's your name?

675
01:34:46,247 --> 01:34:47,790
Aldo.

676
01:34:47,814 --> 01:34:50,488
Okay, Wilhelm,
here's my deal.

677
01:34:50,512 --> 01:34:52,316
You let me
and one of my men

678
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:54,188
come down there
and take the girl away.

679
01:34:54,212 --> 01:34:56,581
No guns... no guns
me, no guns you.

680
01:34:56,605 --> 01:34:59,367
And we take the girl
and leave.

681
01:34:59,391 --> 01:35:00,847
It's that simple, Willy.

682
01:35:00,871 --> 01:35:03,284
You go your way,
and we go ours,

683
01:35:03,308 --> 01:35:04,720
and little Max
gets to grow up

684
01:35:04,744 --> 01:35:07,462
playing catch
with his daddy.

685
01:35:07,486 --> 01:35:09,072
So what do you say,
Willy?

686
01:35:09,096 --> 01:35:10,837
We got us
a deal?

687
01:35:14,841 --> 01:35:17,080
Aldo?

688
01:35:17,104 --> 01:35:18,802
I'm here, Willy.

689
01:35:20,455 --> 01:35:22,172
I want to
trust you,

690
01:35:22,196 --> 01:35:24,348
but-but...

691
01:35:24,372 --> 01:35:25,809
but how can I?

692
01:35:28,028 --> 01:35:29,856
What choice you got, son?

693
01:35:35,731 --> 01:35:38,299
Okay, okay.

694
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:41,801
Aldo...

695
01:35:41,825 --> 01:35:44,194
I'm going to
trust you.

696
01:35:44,218 --> 01:35:45,829
Come down.

697
01:36:01,323 --> 01:36:03,214
Hey, Willy, what's
with the machine gun?

698
01:36:03,238 --> 01:36:04,825
I thought
we had us a deal.

699
01:36:04,849 --> 01:36:06,696
We still have a deal.
Now get the girl and go.

700
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,350
Not so fast.

701
01:36:08,374 --> 01:36:10,874
We only got a deal
if we trust each other.

702
01:36:10,898 --> 01:36:12,745
And a Mexican standoff
ain't trust.

703
01:36:12,769 --> 01:36:16,053
You need guns on me for it
to be a Mexican standoff.

704
01:36:16,077 --> 01:36:17,881
You got guns
on us.

705
01:36:17,905 --> 01:36:19,796
You decide to shoot,
we're dead.

706
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:21,232
Up top,
they got grenades.

707
01:36:21,256 --> 01:36:23,104
They drop 'em down here,
you're dead.

708
01:36:23,128 --> 01:36:25,367
That's a Mexican standoff,
and that was not the deal.

709
01:36:25,391 --> 01:36:27,456
No trust,
no deal.

710
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:28,960
Wilhelm...

711
01:36:43,104 --> 01:36:44,584
All right, Aldo.

712
01:36:46,194 --> 01:36:47,500
Fine.

713
01:36:50,764 --> 01:36:53,003
Just take that
fucking traitor

714
01:36:53,027 --> 01:36:54,986
and get her
out of my sight.

715
01:37:06,475 --> 01:37:08,236
Not so goddamn fast, doc.

716
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:09,957
Tell him to go play
with his dogs.

717
01:37:21,882 --> 01:37:23,947
Before we yank
that slug out you,

718
01:37:23,971 --> 01:37:25,514
you need to answer
a few questions.

719
01:37:25,538 --> 01:37:27,603
A few questions
about what?

720
01:37:27,627 --> 01:37:30,345
About I got three
men dead back there.

721
01:37:30,369 --> 01:37:33,217
Why don't you try telling us
what the fuck happened?

722
01:37:33,241 --> 01:37:35,611
The British officer
blew his German act

723
01:37:35,635 --> 01:37:38,222
and the Gestapo major
saw it.

724
01:37:38,246 --> 01:37:41,138
Before we get into
who shot John...

725
01:37:41,162 --> 01:37:42,879
why did you
invite my men

726
01:37:42,903 --> 01:37:45,688
to a rendezvous in a basement
with a bunch of Nazis?

727
01:37:50,345 --> 01:37:53,107
I can see since you didn't
see what happened inside

728
01:37:53,131 --> 01:37:55,500
that the Nazis being
there must look odd.

729
01:37:55,524 --> 01:37:58,287
Yeah, we got a word for
that kind of odd in English.

730
01:37:58,311 --> 01:38:00,748
It's called
"suspicious."

731
01:38:04,795 --> 01:38:06,773
Everybody needs to
calm down!

732
01:38:06,797 --> 01:38:09,559
You're letting your
imagination get the better of you!

733
01:38:09,583 --> 01:38:12,866
You met the sergeant
yourself!

734
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:15,130
Willy... You remember
him, don't you?

735
01:38:15,154 --> 01:38:16,783
Yeah,
I remember him.

736
01:38:16,807 --> 01:38:18,394
His wife had
a baby tonight.

737
01:38:18,418 --> 01:38:20,396
He had just become
a fa...

738
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:22,311
He had just become
a father!

739
01:38:22,335 --> 01:38:24,704
His commanding officer
gave him and his mates

740
01:38:24,728 --> 01:38:26,817
the night off
to celebrate.

741
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:33,844
The Germans being there
was either a trap set by me

742
01:38:33,868 --> 01:38:36,020
or a tragic coincidence.

743
01:38:36,044 --> 01:38:37,959
It couldn't be both.

744
01:38:47,751 --> 01:38:49,512
How'd the shooting start?

745
01:38:49,536 --> 01:38:51,949
The Englishman
gave himself away.

746
01:38:51,973 --> 01:38:54,106
How'd he do that?

747
01:38:55,368 --> 01:38:57,911
He ordered
three glasses.

748
01:38:57,935 --> 01:39:00,871
We order
three glasses.

749
01:39:00,895 --> 01:39:02,481
That's the German three.

750
01:39:02,505 --> 01:39:05,832
The other looks odd.

751
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:09,034
Germans would
and did notice it.

752
01:39:16,737 --> 01:39:18,932
Okay, let's pretend
there were no Germans

753
01:39:18,956 --> 01:39:21,544
and everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to.

754
01:39:21,568 --> 01:39:23,502
What was
the next step?

755
01:39:23,526 --> 01:39:25,287
Tuxedos.

756
01:39:25,311 --> 01:39:27,115
To get them
into the premiere

757
01:39:27,139 --> 01:39:29,073
wearing
military uniforms

758
01:39:29,097 --> 01:39:31,447
with all the military there
would have been suicide.

759
01:39:33,275 --> 01:39:36,689
But going as members
of the German film industry,

760
01:39:36,713 --> 01:39:40,195
they wear tuxedos and
fit in with everybody else.

761
01:39:41,588 --> 01:39:43,131
I arranged
for the tailor

762
01:39:43,155 --> 01:39:45,916
to fit three tuxedos tonight.

763
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:48,614
How'd you intend to
get them in that premiere?

764
01:39:48,638 --> 01:39:50,510
Hand me my purse.

765
01:39:59,955 --> 01:40:03,848
Lieutenant Hicox
was going as my escort.

766
01:40:03,872 --> 01:40:05,458
The other two
were going

767
01:40:05,482 --> 01:40:08,809
as a German cameraman
and his assistant.

768
01:40:08,833 --> 01:40:10,898
You still get us
in that premiere?

769
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:13,031
You speak German
better than your friends?

770
01:40:13,055 --> 01:40:14,380
No.

771
01:40:14,404 --> 01:40:17,122
Have I been shot?
Yes.

772
01:40:17,146 --> 01:40:19,733
I don't see me tripping
the light fantastique

773
01:40:19,757 --> 01:40:22,867
up at the red carpet
anytime soon.

774
01:40:22,891 --> 01:40:25,111
Least of all,
by tomorrow night.

775
01:40:38,341 --> 01:40:39,927
However...

776
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:43,496
there's something
you don't know.

777
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:46,151
There have been
two recent developments

778
01:40:46,175 --> 01:40:49,241
regarding
Operation Kino.

779
01:40:49,265 --> 01:40:52,331
One... the venue
has been changed

780
01:40:52,355 --> 01:40:54,942
from the Ritz
to a much smaller venue.

781
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:56,640
Enormous change
at the last minute?

782
01:40:56,664 --> 01:40:58,598
That's not very Germatic.

783
01:40:58,622 --> 01:41:01,123
Why the hell is Goebbels
doing stuff so damn peculiar?

784
01:41:01,147 --> 01:41:04,952
It probably has something to
do with the second development.

785
01:41:04,976 --> 01:41:07,240
Which is?

786
01:41:11,244 --> 01:41:13,898
Der Fuhrer is
attending the premiere.

787
01:41:48,542 --> 01:41:50,457
Fuck a duck!

788
01:41:58,379 --> 01:41:59,921
What are you thinking?

789
01:41:59,945 --> 01:42:02,576
I'm thinking of
getting a whack

790
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:06,014
at planting old Uncle Adolf makes
this a horse of a different color.

791
01:42:06,038 --> 01:42:07,886
What is that
supposed to mean?

792
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:09,931
It means you getting us
in that premiere.

793
01:42:09,955 --> 01:42:12,978
I'm probably going to
end up losing this leg!

794
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:15,720
Bye-bye, acting career!
Fun while it lasted.

795
01:42:15,744 --> 01:42:18,747
How do you expect me
to walk the red carpet?

796
01:42:20,749 --> 01:42:23,771
Doggy doc's going to dig
that slug out your gam.

797
01:42:23,795 --> 01:42:25,773
He's gonna wrap it up
in a cast,

798
01:42:25,797 --> 01:42:28,472
and you got a good how-I-broke-my-leg-
mountain-climbing story.

799
01:42:28,496 --> 01:42:30,952
That's German, ain't it? Y'all
like climbing mountains, don't you?

800
01:42:30,976 --> 01:42:32,954
I don't. I like
smoking, drinking,

801
01:42:32,978 --> 01:42:36,131
and ordering in restaurants,
but I see your point.

802
01:42:36,155 --> 01:42:39,657
We fill you up with morphine
till it's coming out your ears

803
01:42:39,681 --> 01:42:43,075
and just limp your little
ass up that rouge carpet.

804
01:42:44,686 --> 01:42:46,707
I know this is
a silly question

805
01:42:46,731 --> 01:42:49,275
before I ask it, but...

806
01:42:49,299 --> 01:42:54,193
can you Americans speak any
other language than English?

807
01:42:54,217 --> 01:42:56,543
We both speak
a little Italian.

808
01:42:56,567 --> 01:42:59,178
With an atrocious accent,
no doubt.

809
01:43:01,006 --> 01:43:05,117
But that doesn't exactly
kill us in the crib.

810
01:43:05,141 --> 01:43:08,187
Germans don't have
a good ear for Italian.

811
01:43:11,582 --> 01:43:14,561
So you mumble Italian
and brazen through it.

812
01:43:14,585 --> 01:43:15,780
Is that a plan?

813
01:43:15,804 --> 01:43:17,632
That's about it.

814
01:43:21,505 --> 01:43:22,656
That sounds good.

815
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:24,092
Sounds like shit.

816
01:43:24,116 --> 01:43:25,311
What else we gonna do,
go home?

817
01:43:25,335 --> 01:43:27,357
No.
That sounds good.

818
01:43:27,381 --> 01:43:28,923
If you don't blow it,

819
01:43:28,947 --> 01:43:31,341
with that, I can get
you in the building.

820
01:43:32,516 --> 01:43:33,885
Who does what?

821
01:43:33,909 --> 01:43:37,323
Well, I speak
the most Italian, so...

822
01:43:37,347 --> 01:43:39,369
I'll be your escort. Donowitz
speaks the second most,

823
01:43:39,393 --> 01:43:41,196
so he'll be
your Italian cameraman.

824
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:43,788
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.

825
01:43:44,963 --> 01:43:46,201
I don't
speak Italian.

826
01:43:46,225 --> 01:43:47,595
Like I said,
third best.

827
01:43:47,619 --> 01:43:49,423
Just keep
your fucking mouth shut.

828
01:43:49,447 --> 01:43:51,319
In fact, why don't you
start practicing right now?

02:01:47,141 --> 02:01:49,990
Sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me!

894
02:01:50,014 --> 02:01:52,775
Fuckin' bratwurst-smelling...
God damn you!

895
02:01:52,799 --> 02:01:54,192
Get off!

896
02:01:58,849 --> 02:02:00,285
Hmm.

897
02:02:12,036 --> 02:02:14,212
You Jerry-bangin',
Lindbergh-smellin'...

898
02:02:17,824 --> 02:02:20,107
As Stanley said
to Livingstone,

899
02:02:20,131 --> 02:02:23,066
Lieutenant Aldo Raine,
I presume?

900
02:02:23,090 --> 02:02:24,527
Hans Landa.

901
02:02:26,572 --> 02:02:30,160
You've had a nice,
long run, Aldo.

902
02:02:30,184 --> 02:02:32,641
Alas, you're now in
the hands of the SS.

903
02:02:32,665 --> 02:02:34,469
My hands,
to be exact.

904
02:02:34,493 --> 02:02:37,080
And they've been
waiting a long time

905
02:02:37,104 --> 02:02:38,497
to touch you.

906
02:02:41,718 --> 02:02:43,589
Caught you flinching.

907
02:02:48,507 --> 02:02:50,117
Touch me again,
Kraut-burger.

908
02:03:06,264 --> 02:03:08,677
- Utivich?
- Is that you, Lieutenant?

909
02:03:08,701 --> 02:03:10,505
Yeah.

910
02:03:10,529 --> 02:03:12,289
Do you know what
happened to Donnie?

911
02:03:12,313 --> 02:03:14,118
Omar?

912
02:03:14,142 --> 02:03:15,293
The woman?

913
02:03:15,317 --> 02:03:16,580
No, I do not.

914
02:04:03,104 --> 02:04:04,647
Tell me, Aldo,

915
02:04:04,671 --> 02:04:06,867
if I were sitting
where you're sitting,

916
02:04:06,891 --> 02:04:08,980
would you show me
mercy?

917
02:04:13,288 --> 02:04:15,266
Nope.

918
02:04:15,290 --> 02:04:18,095
What is that English
expression about shoes and feet?

919
02:04:18,119 --> 02:04:20,489
Looks like the shoe's
on the other foot.

920
02:04:20,513 --> 02:04:22,254
Yeah, I was just
thinking that.

921
02:04:35,049 --> 02:04:38,226
So, you're Aldo
the Apache.

922
02:04:39,445 --> 02:04:40,640
So, you're
the Jew Hunter.

923
02:04:40,664 --> 02:04:42,206
I'm a detective.

924
02:04:42,230 --> 02:04:44,165
A damn good detective.

925
02:04:44,189 --> 02:04:46,210
Finding people
is my specialty,

926
02:04:46,234 --> 02:04:48,778
so naturally I worked for
the Nazis finding people

927
02:04:48,802 --> 02:04:50,563
and, yes,
some of them were Jews,

928
02:04:50,587 --> 02:04:53,130
but Jew Hunter?

929
02:04:53,154 --> 02:04:55,437
Just a name
that stuck.

930
02:04:55,461 --> 02:04:59,789
Well, you do have
to admit, it is catchy.

931
02:04:59,813 --> 02:05:02,705
Do you control the nicknames
your enemies bestow on you?

932
02:05:02,729 --> 02:05:06,187
Aldo the Apache
and the Little Man?

933
02:05:06,211 --> 02:05:08,319
What do you mean
the Little Man?

934
02:05:08,343 --> 02:05:10,453
Germans' nickname
for you.

935
02:05:10,477 --> 02:05:13,325
The Germans' nickname
for me is the Little Man?

936
02:05:13,349 --> 02:05:15,719
And as if
to make my point,

937
02:05:15,743 --> 02:05:18,635
I'm a little surprised how
tall you are in real life.

938
02:05:18,659 --> 02:05:20,028
You're a little fellow,

939
02:05:20,052 --> 02:05:21,420
but not
circus-midget little,

940
02:05:21,444 --> 02:05:23,118
as your reputation suggests.

941
02:05:23,142 --> 02:05:25,033
Where's my men?

942
02:05:25,057 --> 02:05:27,407
Where's
Bridget von Hammersmark?

943
02:05:30,062 --> 02:05:31,866
Well, let's just say

944
02:05:31,890 --> 02:05:35,696
she got
what she deserved.

945
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:38,699
And when you purchase friends
like Bridget von Hammersmark,

946
02:05:38,723 --> 02:05:42,050
you get what
you pay for.

947
02:05:42,074 --> 02:05:44,182
Now, as far as
your <i>paisanos,</i>

948
02:05:44,206 --> 02:05:47,446
Sergeant Donowitz
and Private Omar...

949
02:05:47,470 --> 02:05:49,231
How you know
our names?

950
02:05:49,255 --> 02:05:50,996
Lieutenant Aldo...

951
02:05:52,867 --> 02:05:54,845
if you don't think
I wouldn't interrogate

952
02:05:54,869 --> 02:05:57,611
every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors...

953
02:06:00,266 --> 02:06:01,809
We simply
aren't operating

954
02:06:01,833 --> 02:06:04,072
on the level of mutual
respect I assumed.

955
02:06:04,096 --> 02:06:05,769
No, I guess not.

956
02:06:05,793 --> 02:06:07,684
Well...

957
02:06:07,708 --> 02:06:11,103
back to the whereabouts
of your two Italian saboteurs.

958
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:15,866
As of this moment,

959
02:06:15,890 --> 02:06:17,999
both Omar and Donowitz

960
02:06:18,023 --> 02:06:20,828
should be sitting in the
very seats we left them in.

961
02:06:20,852 --> 02:06:25,267
0023 and 0024,
if my memory serves,

962
02:06:25,291 --> 02:06:27,748
explosives still
around their ankles,

963
02:06:27,772 --> 02:06:29,575
still ready
to explode,

964
02:06:29,599 --> 02:06:31,142
and your mission...

965
02:06:31,166 --> 02:06:32,753
Some would call it
terrorist plot...

966
02:06:32,777 --> 02:06:35,059
As of this moment
is still a go.

967
02:06:35,083 --> 02:06:37,322
That's a pretty exciting
story. What's next?

968
02:06:37,346 --> 02:06:38,584
"Eliza on Ice"?

969
02:06:38,608 --> 02:06:40,132
However...

970
02:06:41,611 --> 02:06:43,024
all I have to do

971
02:06:43,048 --> 02:06:44,982
is pick up this phone
right here,

972
02:06:45,006 --> 02:06:48,009
inform the cinema,
and your plan's kaput.

973
02:06:50,142 --> 02:06:52,250
If they're
still here...

974
02:06:52,274 --> 02:06:54,165
and if they're
still alive,

975
02:06:54,189 --> 02:06:56,559
and that's
one big if.

976
02:06:56,583 --> 02:06:58,735
There ain't no way you're
gonna take them boys

977
02:06:58,759 --> 02:07:00,215
without setting off
them bombs.

978
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:01,912
I have no doubt.

979
02:07:01,936 --> 02:07:04,001
And, yes,
some Germans will die

980
02:07:04,025 --> 02:07:05,742
and, yes, it will
ruin the evening,

981
02:07:05,766 --> 02:07:07,005
and, yes,
Goebbels will be

982
02:07:07,029 --> 02:07:08,703
very, very,
very mad at you

983
02:07:08,727 --> 02:07:11,749
for what you've done
to his big night,

984
02:07:11,773 --> 02:07:14,534
but you won't get Hitler,
you won't get Goebbels,

985
02:07:14,558 --> 02:07:17,320
you won't get Goring,
and you won't get Bormann.

986
02:07:17,344 --> 02:07:21,541
And you need all four
to end the war.

987
02:07:21,565 --> 02:07:24,719
But if I don't pick up
this phone right here,

988
02:07:24,743 --> 02:07:28,287
you may very well
get all four.

989
02:07:28,311 --> 02:07:31,334
And if you get
all four,

990
02:07:31,358 --> 02:07:34,685
you end the war...

991
02:07:34,709 --> 02:07:36,058
tonight.

992
02:07:37,277 --> 02:07:39,124
So, gentlemen,

993
02:07:39,148 --> 02:07:41,300
let's discuss
the prospect

994
02:07:41,324 --> 02:07:43,109
of ending the war tonight.

995
02:07:45,502 --> 02:07:47,350
So, the way
I see it,

996
02:07:47,374 --> 02:07:49,961
since Hitler's death
or possible rescue

997
02:07:49,985 --> 02:07:51,920
rests solely
on my reaction,

998
02:07:51,944 --> 02:07:54,313
if I do nothing,

999
02:07:54,337 --> 02:07:57,403
it's as if I'm causing his death
even more than yourselves,

1000
02:07:57,427 --> 02:07:59,014
wouldn't you agree?

1001
02:07:59,038 --> 02:08:00,648
I guess so.

1002
02:08:02,998 --> 02:08:04,889
How about you,
Utivich?

1003
02:08:04,913 --> 02:08:06,697
I guess so, too.

1004
02:08:11,659 --> 02:08:13,550
Gentlemen,
I have no intention

1005
02:08:13,574 --> 02:08:15,117
of killing Hitler
and killing Goebbels

1006
02:08:15,141 --> 02:08:17,075
and killing Goring
and killing Bormann,

1007
02:08:17,099 --> 02:08:19,730
not to mention winning the
war single-handedly for the Allies

1008
02:08:19,754 --> 02:08:23,366
only later to find myself
standing before a Jewish tribunal.

1009
02:08:25,542 --> 02:08:29,285
If you want to
win the war tonight...

1010
02:08:30,765 --> 02:08:33,072
we have to
make a deal.

1011
02:08:35,726 --> 02:08:37,574
What kind
of deal?

1012
02:08:37,598 --> 02:08:40,185
The kind you wouldn't
have the authority to make.

1013
02:08:40,209 --> 02:08:43,188
However, I'm sure
this mission of yours

1014
02:08:43,212 --> 02:08:45,669
has a commanding officer.

1015
02:08:45,693 --> 02:08:47,279
A general.

1016
02:08:47,303 --> 02:08:49,740
Mm, I'm betting for...

1017
02:08:51,438 --> 02:08:53,353
OSS would be my guess.

1018
02:08:55,964 --> 02:08:59,925
Oooh!
That's a bingo!

1019
02:09:02,711 --> 02:09:04,645
Is that the way you
say it? "That's a bingo"?

1020
02:09:04,669 --> 02:09:06,343
You just say
"bingo".

1021
02:09:06,367 --> 02:09:07,997
Bingo!

1022
02:09:08,021 --> 02:09:09,936
How fun!

1023
02:09:11,589 --> 02:09:13,480
But I digress.
Where were we?

1024
02:09:13,504 --> 02:09:15,265
<i>Ja,</i> make a deal.

1025
02:09:15,289 --> 02:09:18,964
Over there is a very
capable two-way radio,

1026
02:09:18,988 --> 02:09:22,315
and sitting behind it is a more
than capable radio operator

1027
02:09:22,339 --> 02:09:24,752
named... Hermann.

1028
02:09:24,776 --> 02:09:28,060
Get me someone on the other end
of that radio with the power of the pen

1029
02:09:28,084 --> 02:09:29,932
to authorize my...

1030
02:09:29,956 --> 02:09:32,891
let's call it the terms
of my conditional surrender.

1031
02:09:32,915 --> 02:09:34,961
If that tastes better
going down.

1032
02:09:36,179 --> 02:09:37,678
You know,
where I'm from...

1033
02:09:37,702 --> 02:09:39,419
Yeah, where is that
exactly?

1034
02:09:39,443 --> 02:09:40,899
Maynardville,
Tennessee.

1035
02:09:40,923 --> 02:09:44,163
I've done my share
of bootlegging.

1036
02:09:44,187 --> 02:09:48,211
Up there, if you engage in what the
federal government calls illegal activity

1037
02:09:48,235 --> 02:09:50,430
but what we call just a man
trying to make a living for his family

1038
02:09:50,454 --> 02:09:52,563
selling
moonshine liquor,

1039
02:09:52,587 --> 02:09:54,894
it behooves oneself
to keep his wits.

1040
02:09:56,460 --> 02:09:58,003
Long story short,

1041
02:09:58,027 --> 02:10:00,266
we hear a story
too good to be true...

1042
02:10:00,290 --> 02:10:02,075
it ain't.

1043
02:10:03,728 --> 02:10:05,184
Sitting in your chair,

1044
02:10:05,208 --> 02:10:06,751
I would probably
say the same thing.

1045
02:10:06,775 --> 02:10:10,189
And 999.999 times
out of a million,

1046
02:10:10,213 --> 02:10:11,736
you would be correct.

1047
02:10:13,347 --> 02:10:15,151
But in the pages
of history,

1048
02:10:15,175 --> 02:10:17,544
every once in a while,

1049
02:10:17,568 --> 02:10:21,007
fate reaches out
and extends its hand.

1050
02:10:27,317 --> 02:10:29,972
What shall
the history books read?

1051
02:10:56,216 --> 02:10:57,976
I implore you,

1052
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,980
we must destroy
that tower!

1053
02:11:01,004 --> 02:11:03,050
Sergeant,
that tower...

1054
02:11:31,252 --> 02:11:32,557
Psst!

1055
02:11:33,515 --> 02:11:35,082
Psst!

1056
02:11:41,958 --> 02:11:44,676
<i>Scusi.</i>

1057
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:46,939
<i>Pardon.
Scusi, scusi.</i>

1058
02:11:46,963 --> 02:11:48,269
<i>Pardon.</i>

1059
02:11:50,010 --> 02:11:52,031
<i>Scusi!
Pardon.</i>

1060
02:11:52,055 --> 02:11:53,317
<i>Scusi.</i>

1061
02:14:03,274 --> 02:14:06,427
So, when the military history
of this night is written,

1062
02:14:06,451 --> 02:14:10,039
it will be recorded that
I was part of Operation Kino

1063
02:14:10,063 --> 02:14:12,390
from the very beginning
as a double agent.

1064
02:14:12,414 --> 02:14:16,959
Anything I've done
in my guise as an SS colonel

1065
02:14:16,983 --> 02:14:20,224
was sanctioned by the OSS
as a necessary evil

1066
02:14:20,248 --> 02:14:22,965
to establish my cover
with the Germans,

1067
02:14:22,989 --> 02:14:26,534
and it was my placement
of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite

1068
02:14:26,558 --> 02:14:28,275
in Hitler and Goebbels'
opera box

1069
02:14:28,299 --> 02:14:30,171
that assured their demise.

1070
02:14:46,099 --> 02:14:49,209
By the way, that last
part's actually true.

1071
02:14:49,233 --> 02:14:52,866
I want my full military
pension and benefits

1072
02:14:52,890 --> 02:14:54,868
under my proper rank.

1073
02:14:54,892 --> 02:14:57,392
I want to receive the
Congressional Medal of Honor

1074
02:14:57,416 --> 02:14:59,089
for my
invaluable assistance

1075
02:14:59,113 --> 02:15:02,571
in the toppling
of the Third Reich.

1076
02:15:02,595 --> 02:15:06,009
In fact, I want all the
members of Operation Kino

1077
02:15:06,033 --> 02:15:08,186
to receive the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

1078
02:15:08,210 --> 02:15:10,753
Full citizenship
for myself...

1079
02:15:10,777 --> 02:15:12,973
Well, that goes
without saying...

1080
02:15:12,997 --> 02:15:16,716
And I would like
the United States of America

1081
02:15:16,740 --> 02:15:20,633
to purchase property for me
on Nantucket Island

1082
02:15:20,657 --> 02:15:24,071
as a reward for all the
countless lives I've saved

1083
02:15:24,095 --> 02:15:26,552
by bringing the tyranny of
the National Socialist Party

1084
02:15:26,576 --> 02:15:28,249
to a swifter
than imagined end.

1085
02:15:28,273 --> 02:15:29,796
Do you have
all that, sir?

1086
02:15:31,058 --> 02:15:32,819
I look forward

1087
02:15:32,843 --> 02:15:36,170
to seeing you face
to face, as well, sir.

1088
02:15:36,194 --> 02:15:38,283
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.

1089
02:15:41,330 --> 02:15:43,482
Yes, sir?

1090
02:15:43,506 --> 02:15:45,005
<i>Colonel Landa will put you
and Private Utivich</i>

1091
02:15:45,029 --> 02:15:46,876
<i>in a truck as prisoners.</i>

1092
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:49,270
<i>Then he and his radio operator
will get in the truck</i>

1093
02:15:49,294 --> 02:15:51,098
<i>and drive to our lines.</i>

1094
02:15:51,122 --> 02:15:53,056
<i>Upon crossing our lines,</i>

1095
02:15:53,080 --> 02:15:55,711
<i>Colonel Landa and his men
will surrender to you.</i>

1096
02:15:55,735 --> 02:15:58,584
<i>You will then take over
driving of the truck</i>

1097
02:15:58,608 --> 02:16:00,934
<i>and bring them straight
to me for debriefing.</i>

1098
02:16:00,958 --> 02:16:02,936
- Is that clear, Lieutenant?
- Yes, sir.

1099
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:04,483
<i>Over and out.</i>

1100
02:21:49,048 --> 02:21:51,548
When I kill that guy, you got
30 feet to get to that guard.

1101
02:21:51,572 --> 02:21:53,705
- Can you do it?
- I have to.

1102
02:22:23,517 --> 02:22:25,258
Champagne?

1103
02:23:17,006 --> 02:23:20,464
Who wants to send
a message to Germany?

1104
02:23:20,488 --> 02:23:23,273
I have a message
for Germany.

1105
02:23:26,320 --> 02:23:28,626
That you are all
going to die.

1106
02:23:32,805 --> 02:23:35,044
And I want you to look
deep into the face

1107
02:23:35,068 --> 02:23:38,158
of the Jew
who is going to do it.

1108
02:23:39,812 --> 02:23:43,226
Marcel,
burn it down.

1109
02:23:43,250 --> 02:23:44,991
<i>Oui,</i> Shosanna.

1110
02:24:20,722 --> 02:24:23,309
My name is
Shosanna Dreyfus,

1111
02:24:23,333 --> 02:24:24,944
and this is
the face...

1112
02:24:26,989 --> 02:24:29,513
of Jewish vengeance.

1113
02:26:34,684 --> 02:26:36,381
Hermann, uncuff them.

1114
02:26:55,226 --> 02:26:57,291
I'm officially
surrendering myself

1115
02:26:57,315 --> 02:27:00,120
over to you,
Lieutenant Raine.

1116
02:27:00,144 --> 02:27:01,798
We're
your prisoners.

1117
02:27:03,104 --> 02:27:04,714
How about my knife?

1118
02:27:10,546 --> 02:27:12,698
Thank you very much, Colonel.

1119
02:27:12,722 --> 02:27:15,962
Utivich, cuff the colonel's
hands behind his back.

1120
02:27:15,986 --> 02:27:18,225
Aww, is that
really necessary?

1121
02:27:18,249 --> 02:27:20,338
I'm a slave
to appearances.

1122
02:27:23,428 --> 02:27:24,952
Scalp Hermann.

1123
02:27:26,736 --> 02:27:28,757
Are you mad?

1124
02:27:28,781 --> 02:27:30,803
What have you done?

1125
02:27:30,827 --> 02:27:34,459
I made a deal with your
general for that man's life!

1126
02:27:34,483 --> 02:27:36,113
Yeah, they made
that deal,

1127
02:27:36,137 --> 02:27:37,897
but they don't give
a fuck about him.

1128
02:27:37,921 --> 02:27:40,508
- They need you.
- You'll be shot for this!

1129
02:27:40,532 --> 02:27:43,511
No, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.

1130
02:27:43,535 --> 02:27:45,383
I've been
chewed out before.

1131
02:27:45,407 --> 02:27:48,647
You know, Utivich
and myself heard

1132
02:27:48,671 --> 02:27:50,910
that deal you made
with the brass.

1133
02:27:50,934 --> 02:27:52,762
End the war tonight?

1134
02:27:54,111 --> 02:27:55,654
I'd make that deal.

1135
02:27:55,678 --> 02:27:57,612
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?

1136
02:27:57,636 --> 02:27:58,657
I'd make that deal.

1137
02:27:58,681 --> 02:27:59,963
I don't blame you.

1138
02:27:59,987 --> 02:28:01,921
Damn good deal.

1139
02:28:01,945 --> 02:28:04,924
And that pretty little nest
you feathered for yourself.

1140
02:28:04,948 --> 02:28:08,754
Well, if you're willing to
barbecue the whole high command,

1141
02:28:08,778 --> 02:28:12,149
I suppose that's worth
certain considerations.

1142
02:28:12,173 --> 02:28:15,456
But I do have
one question.

1143
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:18,372
When you get to your little
place on Nantucket Island,

1144
02:28:18,396 --> 02:28:20,026
I imagine you're
gonna take off

1145
02:28:20,050 --> 02:28:22,986
that handsome-looking
SS uniform of yours,

1146
02:28:23,010 --> 02:28:24,620
ain't you?

1147
02:28:28,233 --> 02:28:30,733
That's what I thought.

1148
02:28:30,757 --> 02:28:34,128
Now, that
I can't abide.

1149
02:28:34,152 --> 02:28:36,957
How about you, Utivich?
Can you abide it?

1150
02:28:36,981 --> 02:28:38,591
Not one damn bit, sir.

1151
02:28:40,202 --> 02:28:42,658
I mean,
if I had my way,

1152
02:28:42,682 --> 02:28:44,747
you'd wear
that goddamn uniform

1153
02:28:44,771 --> 02:28:48,099
for the rest of
your pecker-sucking life.

1154
02:28:48,123 --> 02:28:50,188
But I'm aware
that ain't practical.

1155
02:28:50,212 --> 02:28:53,017
I mean, at some point,
you're gonna have to take it off.

1156
02:28:53,041 --> 02:28:57,610
So I'm gonna give you a little
something you can't take off.

1157
02:29:23,506 --> 02:29:26,267
You know something,
Utivich?

1158
02:29:26,291 --> 02:29:28,902
I think this might
just be my masterpiece.
