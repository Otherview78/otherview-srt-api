1
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,869
Mrs Peterson!

2
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,497
Ramon, hey! How's it going?

3
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,457
How you doing?

4
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,085
There it is, there on the desk.

5
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,878
Where's she headed?

6
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,588
She's snowbound, Ramon.

7
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,094
See you went with the pink.

8
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,472
Yeah, yeah. It's kind of a pink day today.

9
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,517
I'll have another pickup for you
on Thursday.

10
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,186
- All right. See you then.
- All right. Thanks.

11
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,557
Peterson! Peterson!

12
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:45,851
Peterson.

13
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,940
- Mr Cowboy, <i>da?
- Da.</i>

14
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,613
Mmm, it's pretty.

15
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,410
It's from my wife.

16
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,897
Time rules over us
without mercy,

17
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,901
not caring if we're healthy or ill,
hungry or drunk,

18
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,363
Russian, American, beings from Mars.

19
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,658
It's like a fire. It could either destroy us
or keep us warm.

20
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,244
That's why every FedEx office
has a clock.

21
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,080
Because we live or we die by the clock.

22
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,915
We never turn our back on it.

23
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:37,087
And we never, ever allow ourselves
the sin of losing track of time!

24
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,923
Locally, it's 1 :56.

25
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,802
That means we've got
three hours and four minutes

26
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,720
before the end-of-the-day's
package sort.

27
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:49,349
That's how long we have.
That's how much time we have

28
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,103
before this pulsating, accursed,
relentless taskmaster

29
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,605
tries to put us out of business.

30
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,025
Hey, Nicolai. Good to see you.

31
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,777
How are you, kid?

32
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,196
You just delivered
your very first FedEx package.

33
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,365
That deserves something special,

34
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:09,286
like a Snickers bar and a CD player.

35
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,873
And something to listen to.
There. Elvis Presley.

36
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,708
Fifty million fans can't be wrong.

37
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,626
You all recognise this, don't you?

38
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,546
I took the liberty of
sending this to myself.

39
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:24,134
I FedEx'd it before I left Memphis.

40
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,761
You're probably wondering
what could be in here.

41
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:30,932
Is it architectural plans?
Maybe technical drawings?

42
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,977
Is this the new wallpaper
for the bathroom?

43
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,690
It is a clock,

44
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,567
which I started at absolute zero,

45
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,863
and is now at 87 hours,
22 minutes and 17 seconds.

46
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:50,160
From Memphis, America,
to Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours.

47
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,372
Eighty-seven hours
is a shameful outrage.

48
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,833
This is just an egg timer!

49
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,253
What if it had been something else?
Like your paycheque?

50
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,340
Or fresh boysenberries?
Or adoption papers?

51
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,383
Eighty-seven hours is an eternity.

52
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,510
The cosmos was created in less time!

53
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,430
Wars have been fought
and nations toppled in 87 hours!

54
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,849
Fortunes made and squandered.

55
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,357
What? What are you saying about me?

56
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,942
I tell them, what do they expect?

57
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:26,279
This man, when his truck broke down,
he stole a boy's bicycle.

58
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,074
I borrowed it! I borrowed a kid's bike.

59
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,619
I got my packages delivered,
and that is what you have to do.

60
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,954
You have to do whatever it takes,

61
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,039
because in three hours and two minutes

62
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,417
every one of these packages
has to be on the big truck,

63
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,127
on its way to the airport.

64
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,797
Fifteen minutes!

65
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,050
- Crunch time! Crunch time!
- Crunch time!

66
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,470
Let's go! Every package
on the airport truck.

67
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,722
Go! Crunch, crunch, crunch!

68
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,557
- We have a big problem.
- What?

69
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,435
- The truck in Red Square is stuck.
- What?

70
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,146
- It's stuck.
- Stuck how? In snow? In ice?

71
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,733
The most important truck,
the Kremlin truck! Many packages.

72
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,164
All right. Let's put the table right here.
We'll just do the sort.

73
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,001
Ah, yeah, a clamp.
That would make us stuck.

74
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,837
Let's go. Unload... Get him out of there.

75
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,673
Right here. Two lines, two lines.

76
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,592
One to the airport truck,
one to the Moscow truck.

77
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,885
Got it?

78
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,139
CDG, FE, ME, Memphis
on the airport truck.

79
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,600
Everything else there. Nicolai!
Tick-tock, tick-tock. Four minutes.

80
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,814
<i>Hi, this is Kelly.
If you're calling for Chuck, press one.</i>

81
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,400
<i>Otherwise, leave a message. Thanks.</i>

82
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,987
<i>Kelly. Are you there?
Pick up, pick up, pick up.</i>

83
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,031
<i>You're not there.</i>

84
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:55,410
<i>I'm doing the sorts in Red Square,
in the shadow of Lenin's tomb.</i>

85
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,745
<i>I miss you.</i>

86
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,872
I miss you, I really wanna kiss you.

87
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,833
I'm picking up the sweep through Paris.

88
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,461
I should be back in Memphis
in about 18 hours.

89
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,837
That's the good news.

90
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,673
The bad news is...
I gotta go to the dentist this week.

91
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,216
I got something that's hurting.

92
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,553
I'll see you soon,
and you know what that means.

93
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,306
Bye-bye. Nicolai!
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock!

94
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,869
I absolutely, positively have to
get to Memphis tonight.

95
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,913
Can't help you. Try UPS.

96
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,957
Will we be able to push it
and make the sort?

97
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,085
- We'll do our best.
- "Our best"?

98
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:49,130
Gwen, what's wrong with our doctors
that Jack is certified to fly?

99
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,132
Aren't you concerned?

100
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,802
Terrified, but a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

101
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,930
That's the spirit. Relentless is our goal.

102
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:01,392
What do you expect from the guy
who stole a crippled kid's bicycle?

103
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,854
I borrowed it.
But I love that the kid's now crippled.

104
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,440
So you missed the last truck
by two minutes?

105
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,026
Two minutes. Actually, it was less.

106
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,571
The plane wasn't heavy.
You could've added some fuel

107
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,824
and picked up speed.

108
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,701
It's about the trucks.
Today's truck was two minutes late.

109
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,746
Tomorrow's will be four minutes late,
then six, eight.

110
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,499
Next thing you know, we're the US Mail.

111
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,960
Well, all I'm saying is,

112
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,419
if you'd gotten
all those trucks on the plane,

113
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,256
those Russkies would be
walking on water now.

114
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,051
Hey, don't give me that look.
It's just grape juice.

115
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,427
- Right, Chuck?
- Yeah.

116
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,389
Yeah. It's like
a 1992 full-bodied grape juice.

117
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,766
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.

118
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,978
We'd offer you some,
but somebody's got to fly the plane.

119
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,564
Yeah, well, I "just say no," right?

120
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,735
Listen, Stan, I've been meaning
to ask you, how's Mary?

121
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,864
Oh. Uh, well...

122
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,742
- We really don't know anything yet.
- Mmm-hmm.

123
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,788
Uh, she went to the doctor yesterday,
and, uh...

124
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,751
It hasn't metastasized

125
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,754
as far as they can tell right now.

126
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,924
It's just kind of wait and see.

127
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,759
I'm so sorry.

128
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,805
Tell her I'm gonna come by
and see her on my next layover.

129
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,225
I want you to know, Stan,
we are all thinking about her and you,

130
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,270
- and just blessings.
- Thank you, Gwen.

131
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,480
<i>Hi, this is Kelly.
If you're calling for Chuck, press one.</i>

132
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,233
<i>Otherwise, leave a message.</i>

133
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,115
Stan...

134
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,911
Listen. I heard about this...

135
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,374
I heard about this doctor
down in Emory, in Atlanta.

136
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,378
He's supposed to be the best.
He worked on Frank Toretto's wife.

137
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:56,382
Frank's a systems analyst.
He played center field for us.

138
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,636
You know him. The softball tournament
last Labour Day.

139
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,554
Anyway, beside the point.

140
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:05,391
Uh, what I was thinking is,
is that I could get his number,

141
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,144
the doctor, and, uh...

142
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,731
You know, put you all together and...

143
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,819
You know, you could get this thing fixed.
You could beat it.

144
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,782
Thanks, Chuck.

145
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,034
So, I'll get his number.

146
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,378
- And why is that?
- When it's chemically ordered...

147
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:49,352
- Is Kelly Frears around?
- She's copying her dissertation.

148
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,511
- You're home.
- Home indeed.

149
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,555
I love that you're home.

150
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,578
<i>Just days before Santa departs
on his annual gift-giving venture,</i>

151
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,414
<i>he's been declared physically fit to fly.</i>

152
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:55,501
<i>Santa got checked out at the
VA Hospital in Augusta, Georgia.</i>

153
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,254
<i>After doctors declared the jolly old elf
in tiptop shape,</i>

154
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,924
<i>Santa took off into the wild blue yonder
for an early start.</i>

155
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,594
<i>In Sarajevo,
he spent the day with children,</i>

156
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,263
<i>handing out presents
and even helping them decorate</i>

157
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,432
<i>the special Christmas tree.</i>

158
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:18,024
<i>Santa and elves took over the floor
at the Hong Kong Futures Exchange.</i>

159
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,360
<i>Market traders bought Santa hats...</i>

160
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:47,637
- The turkey's a bit dry, isn't it?
- No. The turkey is perfect!

161
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,769
- How many did you do last night?
- Last night? 2.9 million.

162
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:58,815
Now, you've got to be in the market
for more of these candied yams.

163
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,485
2.9 has got to be the record.

164
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,986
Look at those marshmallows.

165
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,324
- We thought two million was a big deal.
- The glory days.

166
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,369
- What'd they do the first night?
- First night?

167
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,329
- Twelve.
- Twelve thousand?

168
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,957
- Hell, no. Twelve.
- That's right.

169
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,251
They did the sort right there
on a card table.

170
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,462
And Fred Smith
had that card table bronzed.

171
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,090
I've been hearing that for five years.

172
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:28,302
- It's in his office today.
- From that to the hub at Anchorage.

173
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:32,473
It's a perfect marriage between
technology and systems management.

174
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:38,020
Speaking of marriage, when are you
gonna make an honest woman of Kelly?

175
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,899
- How long?
- Fourteen minutes into the meal.

176
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,026
You won. I owe you five.

177
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,696
- Way before the pie.
- I told him.

178
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,949
Right about the time the pie came out,
the marriage...

179
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,077
Kelly's still recovering after that parolee.

180
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,288
He was a lawyer.

181
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:59,333
I knew it had something to do
with swearing to tell the truth.

182
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,837
Remember when he fell and broke
his shoulder at the wedding reception?

183
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,715
He tripped on a kerb
holding a door open for me.

184
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,594
- Aunt Kelly was married?
- It's not worth remembering.

185
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,054
So since her failed marriage
to the parolee...

186
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,890
Oh, my God.

187
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,101
Kelly can't see being with a man
who wears a pager to bed.

188
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,145
What are you gonna attach it to?

189
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,106
When you wear it to bed,
I hope you got one of those things

190
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,941
that goes vibrating.

191
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,278
I'm not touching that.

192
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,989
Oh, did you hit an olive pit?

193
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,701
- I thought I took all of them out.
- No, no, it's not that.

194
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,147
- Okay, I'll cancel Saturday.
- No, don't.

195
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,858
If I'm not here, I'm not.
But if I am, then I am.

196
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,694
It's cancelled.
But you gotta be here New Year's Eve.

197
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,280
Malaysia can't be that bad.

198
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,033
- When do you defend your dissertation?
- January 12.

199
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:18,538
I'm gonna have to switch over
the South America thing.

200
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,123
If I do that on the third or fourth,

201
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,917
I'll have to head back out on the 13th.

202
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,961
So long as you're here New Year's Eve.

203
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,838
I will be here New Year's Eve. I promise.

204
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,052
What?

205
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,972
What about our Christmas?
I got a gift for you.

206
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,060
We have to do it in the car.

207
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,819
I'd just like a minute over here,
all right? Thanks.

208
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:01,080
Two minutes, okay? Two more minutes.
Thanks. Hey!

209
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,250
- Merry Christmas.
- I thought you were gonna stiff me.

210
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,585
What is the ribbon?

211
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,796
A thousand-pound test fishing line
or something?

212
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,257
- Here's your fancy thing.
- Thanks.

213
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,513
I love the wrapping.

214
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,475
- And I love the box.
- Good.

215
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:24,979
Oh.

216
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,568
Oh, my. Oh, that is terrific.

217
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,863
My granddaddy used it
on the Southern Pacific.

218
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:40,161
Hey, I took this.
This is my favourite picture of you.

219
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,706
You know what I'm gonna do?

220
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,917
I'm always gonna keep this
on Memphis time.

221
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,715
Kelly time.

222
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:53,883
Hmm.

223
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,802
You haven't said anything
about your presents.

224
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:01,223
I'm sorry. No, I love them.
Look at my journal. Ah!

225
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:05,102
- What about the pager?
- Real leather. Gold on the pages!

226
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,105
- Did you like the pager or not?
- Yes. I love it.

227
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,067
Look at him
in his little blue Russian house.

228
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,985
- It's from Russia.
- My God.

229
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,946
- It's not one of those loud ones?
- No.

230
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,242
You can program it so it vibrates
and lights up and see it in the dark.

231
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,204
It seems like a real nice...pager.

232
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,208
- Sorry about the towels.
- I love them!

233
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,627
- You're hard to shop for.
- Every time I wash my hands,

234
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,254
- I will think of you.
- All right, I gotta go.

235
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,882
Merry Christmas.

236
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,842
- Merry Christmas.
- I love you.

237
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,469
I love you, too.

238
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,103
Chuck!

239
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,604
Keys!

240
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,492
- Thank you.
- That reminds me. I almost forgot.

241
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,911
I have one more present for you.

242
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,458
Only this isn't an "open in the car"
kind of present

243
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,338
like, say, hand towels.
Which were a joke, by the way.

244
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,886
I'm terrified.

245
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,726
Just take it and hold on to it,
and you can open it on New Year's Eve.

246
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,146
And I love you.

247
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,152
I'll be right back.

...Tamara at 1620.

264

01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:02,795
Yes!

345
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:05,464
Look what I have created!

346
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,842
I have made fire!

347
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:11,178
I have made fire!

348
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:24,483
Mmm!

349
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,243
You gotta love crab.

350
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,456
In the nick of time, too.

351
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:43,628
I couldn't take much more
of those coconuts.

352
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,671
Coconut milk's a natural laxative.

353
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:50,384
Things that Gilligan never told us.

354
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:51,802
Oh.

355
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,056
Mmm.

356
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:07,276
Pretty well-made fire, huh, Wilson?

357
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,328
So, Wilson.

358
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:24,043
We were en route from Memphis
for 11 and a half hours.

359
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:28,839
About 475 miles an hour.

360
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,759
So they think that we are right here.

361
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:37,390
But we went out of radio contact,

362
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:41,769
then flew around that storm
for about an hour.

363
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:45,731
So that's a distance of what, 400 miles?

364
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:48,985
Four hundred miles squared.

365
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:54,407
That's 160,000 times pi,

366
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,243
3.14.

367
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:03,874
502,004...

368
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:08,254
That's a search area
of 500,000 square miles.

369
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:13,092
That's twice the size of Texas.

370
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,471
They may never find us.

371
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:44,790
This tooth is just killing me.

372
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,793
It started out just hurting
when I bit down,

373
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:51,464
but now it just hurts all the time.

374
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,466
All the time.

375
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,219
It's a good thing
there's not much to eat around here,

376
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:59,722
'cause I don't think I could chew it.

377
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:04,769
Just keep sucking on all that coconut
and all that crab.

378
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:12,818
And just think, I used to avoid
going to the dentist like the plague.

379
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:16,739
I put it off every single chance I got.

380
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,157
But now...

381
01:16:18,783 --> 01:16:20,910
Oh, what I wouldn't give

382
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:25,873
to have a dentist right here in this cave.

383
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,839
In fact, I wish you were a dentist.

384
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:40,137
Yeah.

385
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:42,807
Dr Wilson.

386
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,152
You wanna hear something funny?

387
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:58,864
Back home in Memphis,

388
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:03,285
my dentist's name
is Dr James Spalding.

389
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:26,892
She's much prettier in real life.

390
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,673
Ah... Ah.

391
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:46,985
Shut up!

392
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:53,760
"Bakersfield"?

393
01:22:58,390 --> 01:22:59,766
Bakersfield!

394
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,451
This could work.

395
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,288
This could work.

396
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:40,993
22, 44 lashings.

397
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,621
44 lashings. So...

398
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:49,251
We have to make rope again.

399
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,632
Wilson, we have to make
a hell of a lot of rope.

400
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:06,935
Eight lashings of these structurals.
That's 24 apiece.

401
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:11,189
That'll be 100... 160.

402
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:13,525
<i>Here we are today.</i>

403
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:18,113
That gives us a month and a half
until we're into March and April,

404
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:22,034
which is our best chances for high tides
and offshore breezes.

405
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:24,578
We need...

406
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:29,750
We need 424 feet of good rope,

407
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:32,794
another 50 feet for miscellaneous.

408
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:36,048
Round that off to 475 feet of good rope.

409
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:40,218
Now, if we average 15 feet a day...

410
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:44,681
Plus, we have to build it,

411
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:48,935
we have to stock it, we have to launch it.

412
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:52,606
That's gonna be tight.

413
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:55,567
That is not much time.

414
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:58,445
But we...

415
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:01,615
We live and we die by time, don't we?

416
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:07,746
Now, let's not commit the sin
of turning our back on time.

417
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:14,086
I know.

418
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:16,922
I know.

419
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,319
This is it.

420
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:43,615
That's all that's left.

421
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:48,245
I checked over the whole island,
and that is all that's left.

422
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,580
So we're gonna be short.

423
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:54,835
Short.

424
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:06,138
We're just gonna have to make
some more out of videotape.

425
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,724
Yes. No, we have time.

426
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:10,559
We do. We have time. Look!

427
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:13,353
The wind's still blowing in
from the west.

428
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:20,694
I know!

429
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:25,323
Yeah, I know. I know where
there's 30 feet of extra rope!

430
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:26,533
But...

431
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:28,785
But I'm not going back up there.

432
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:44,069
There, there. There, you see? Huh?

433
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:46,696
There. Are you happy?

434
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:57,332
Do you have to keep bringing that up?
Can't you just forget it?

435
01:28:57,707 --> 01:28:59,918
Huh? You were right.

436
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:03,588
You were right.
It was good that we did a test,

437
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:06,258
'cause it wasn't gonna be
just a quick little snap.

438
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:09,427
I would have landed on the rocks.

439
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:13,139
Broken my leg or my back or my neck.

440
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:17,561
Bled to death. It was the only option
I had though, okay?

441
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:19,938
It was what, a year ago?

442
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,274
So let's just forget it.

443
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:28,780
And what is your point?

444
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:34,995
Well... We might just make it.

445
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:37,914
Did that thought ever cross your brain?

446
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:42,961
Regardless, I would rather take
my chance out on the ocean

447
01:29:43,253 --> 01:29:46,047
than to stay here and die
on this shithole island,

448
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:51,219
spending the rest of my life
talking to a goddamn volleyball!

449
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:57,976
Shut you up.

450
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:07,193
Wilson!

451
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:09,154
Wilson!

452
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:17,662
Wilson!

453
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,081
Wilson!

454
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:23,668
Wilson!

455
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:26,671
Wilson.

456
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:31,259
Wilson!

457
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:34,804
Oh, God!

458
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:37,015
Wilson! Wilson!

459
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:39,809
Wilson!

460
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:48,193
Oh! Oh! Never again.

461
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:50,445
Never again, never again.

462
01:30:50,737 --> 01:30:53,573
You're okay. You okay? Yeah.

463
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:14,177
Yeah, I know you.

464
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:17,222
I know you. I know you.

465
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:25,480
So... We okay?

466
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:28,149
Okay?

467
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:32,112
Okay.

468
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:12,295
You still awake?

469
01:33:15,215 --> 01:33:16,591
Me, too.

470
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:26,184
You scared?

471
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:31,356
Me, too.

472
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:50,643
Okay.

473
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:52,729
Here we go, Wilson.

474
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:57,358
You don't have to worry about anything.
I'll do all the paddling.

475
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:00,236
You just hang on.

476
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:48,243
Not yet! Hold on!

477
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:03,341
Not yet! Not yet!

478
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:07,428
Not yet!

479
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:12,183
Stand by, Wilson!

480
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:16,771
Hold on! Hold on, Wilson!

481
01:36:36,082 --> 01:36:37,292
I think we did it!

482
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:40,086
I think we did it!

483
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:42,171
Wilson!

484
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:46,551
I think we did it!

485
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:21,807
Oh! They're gone!

486
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:29,607
I don't know why!

487
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:54,692
Where's Wilson?

488
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:58,696
Where's Wilson?

489
01:42:00,072 --> 01:42:01,949
Wilson, where are you?

490
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:04,994
Wilson!

491
01:42:09,498 --> 01:42:10,708
Wilson!

492
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:13,210
Wilson!

493
01:42:41,822 --> 01:42:43,824
Wilson! I'm coming!

494
01:42:46,952 --> 01:42:47,953
Wilson!

495
01:43:09,225 --> 01:43:10,226
Wilson!

496
01:43:11,727 --> 01:43:12,937
Wilson...

497
01:43:19,443 --> 01:43:20,653
Wilson!

498
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:29,286
Wilson! Wilson!

499
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:44,468
Wilson!

500
01:43:48,013 --> 01:43:49,014
Wilson!

501
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:51,642
I'm sorry!

502
01:43:53,477 --> 01:43:55,146
I'm sorry, Wilson!

503
01:43:56,272 --> 01:43:57,940
Wilson, I'm sorry!

504
01:43:59,358 --> 01:44:00,693
I'm sorry!

505
01:44:01,777 --> 01:44:02,987
Wilson!

506
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:05,698
I can't!

507
01:44:06,866 --> 01:44:07,867
Wilson!

508
01:44:09,535 --> 01:44:11,620
Wilson!

509
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:51,869
I'm... I'm sorry.

510
01:44:54,997 --> 01:44:56,707
I'm sorry.

511
01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:01,337
I'm sorry.

512
01:47:02,499 --> 01:47:03,751
Kelly...

513
01:47:10,132 --> 01:47:11,133
Kelly.

514
01:47:13,344 --> 01:47:14,470
Kelly...

515
01:47:21,226 --> 01:47:22,394
Hello?

516
01:47:22,937 --> 01:47:24,521
Oh, how are you?

517
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:27,191
Okay.

518
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,401
45 minutes.

519
01:48:12,361 --> 01:48:13,946
One Dr Pepper,

520
01:48:15,197 --> 01:48:16,657
two cups of ice.

521
01:48:17,491 --> 01:48:18,867
I like ice.

522
01:48:22,162 --> 01:48:24,289
Well, here's the drill.

523
01:48:24,999 --> 01:48:27,042
Um, plane pulls in, we get off,

524
01:48:27,126 --> 01:48:30,087
and there's a little ceremony
right there in the hangar.

525
01:48:31,171 --> 01:48:33,507
Fred Smith will say a few words.

526
01:48:33,632 --> 01:48:37,177
All you have to do is smile
and say thank you.

527
01:48:38,512 --> 01:48:40,597
Then we'll take you over to see Kelly.

528
01:48:43,225 --> 01:48:45,728
She's actually gonna be there, huh?

529
01:48:46,687 --> 01:48:48,772
Well, that's what we have arranged.

530
01:48:48,856 --> 01:48:52,317
- If you're sure you wanna do that.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Yes.

531
01:48:57,114 --> 01:48:59,283
I don't know what I'm gonna say to her.

532
01:49:00,826 --> 01:49:03,078
What in the world
am I gonna say to her?

533
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:09,793
Chuck,
Kelly had to let you go.

534
01:49:10,377 --> 01:49:11,378
You know?

535
01:49:12,546 --> 01:49:16,967
She thought you were dead.
And we buried you.

536
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:23,390
We had a funeral and a coffin,
a gravestone.

537
01:49:23,474 --> 01:49:24,808
The whole thing.

538
01:49:26,643 --> 01:49:28,270
You had a coffin?

539
01:49:31,523 --> 01:49:33,067
What was in it?

540
01:49:34,485 --> 01:49:36,695
Well, everybody put something in.

541
01:49:37,362 --> 01:49:41,992
You know, just a cell phone
or a beeper, some pictures.

542
01:49:42,242 --> 01:49:44,203
I put in some Elvis CDs.

543
01:49:47,247 --> 01:49:49,166
So you had my funeral,

544
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:53,837
and then you had Mary's funeral.

545
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:02,846
Stan, I'm so sorry I wasn't around
when Mary died.

546
01:50:05,015 --> 01:50:08,519
I should've been there for you,
and I wasn't.

547
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:14,566
I'm so sorry.

548
01:50:15,526 --> 01:50:20,989
<i>Four years ago, the FedEx family
lost five of our sons.</i>

549
01:50:22,116 --> 01:50:24,618
<i>That was a terrible and tragic day.</i>

550
01:50:26,161 --> 01:50:29,039
<i>But today, one of those sons,</i>

551
01:50:29,206 --> 01:50:32,501
<i>Chuck Noland, has been returned to us.</i>

552
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:35,546
<i>Chuck, welcome home.</i>

553
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:48,725
<i>Moments ago, Fred Smith
welcomed home Chuck Noland.</i>

554
01:50:49,143 --> 01:50:50,144
<i>Michelle?</i>

555
01:50:50,227 --> 01:50:53,480
<i>It's an incredible story,
to come back from the dead.</i>

556
01:50:53,564 --> 01:50:56,024
<i>So amazing that
Fred Smith welcomed him.</i>

557
01:50:56,108 --> 01:50:58,235
<i>And Fred acknowledged that,</i>

558
01:50:58,318 --> 01:51:00,237
<i>"While time waits for no man,</i>

559
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,990
<i>"we take time to pause
to honour one of our own."</i>

560
01:51:03,073 --> 01:51:05,492
<i>Now, that's an expensive pause.</i>

561
01:51:13,375 --> 01:51:15,377
I'm sorry. I must be in the wrong place.

562
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,254
No, you're in the right place.

563
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:19,882
You probably don't remember me.

564
01:51:19,965 --> 01:51:22,634
I did root canal on you
about five years ago.

565
01:51:23,177 --> 01:51:24,887
Jim Spalding referred you.

566
01:51:27,055 --> 01:51:28,599
Oh, yeah, yeah.

567
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:35,522
I'm Kelly's husband.

568
01:51:37,357 --> 01:51:38,817
Jerry Lovett.

569
01:51:39,902 --> 01:51:41,153
Kelly wanted...

570
01:51:42,988 --> 01:51:44,781
Kelly wanted to be here...

571
01:51:47,451 --> 01:51:50,078
Look, this is very hard for everyone.

572
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:54,791
I can't even imagine
how hard it is for you.

573
01:51:58,962 --> 01:52:00,172
Kelly, uh...

574
01:52:03,592 --> 01:52:05,302
She's had it rough.

575
01:52:05,469 --> 01:52:09,765
First when she thought she lost you,
now dealing with all of this.

576
01:52:09,973 --> 01:52:11,225
It's confusing.

577
01:52:11,433 --> 01:52:14,269
It's very emotional for her. She's...

578
01:52:17,356 --> 01:52:18,357
She's

579
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:21,318
sort of lost.

580
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:25,614
Maybe you could just
give her a little more time.

581
01:52:31,161 --> 01:52:32,162
Anyway...

582
01:52:33,705 --> 01:52:35,332
I'm sorry that...

583
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:34,683
Okay, people, let's go.

584
01:53:34,766 --> 01:53:36,893
Party's over. Let's go home.

585
01:53:37,519 --> 01:53:39,855
You're gonna have to
go down at the DMV.

586
01:53:40,355 --> 01:53:42,357
Okay, Maynard, let's go.
Chuck's had a big day.

587
01:53:42,441 --> 01:53:46,278
I have to brief him on his meetings
with the accountants and attorneys.

588
01:53:46,361 --> 01:53:48,655
I will see you bright and early
in the morning.

589
01:53:49,156 --> 01:53:52,075
Chuck, welcome home. We love you.

590
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:53,660
Becca, I need to speak to you.

591
01:53:53,744 --> 01:53:57,039
Chuck, we gotta catch up
on some of that fishing, now.

592
01:53:57,247 --> 01:53:58,582
Take care.

593
01:54:01,835 --> 01:54:03,754
- Good night.
- Good night.

594
01:54:07,382 --> 01:54:09,426
You got everything you need?

595
01:54:09,509 --> 01:54:14,014
Okay. If you need anything, sign for it,
and I'll see you in the morning.

596
01:54:14,097 --> 01:54:17,100
Get some sleep.
We got another big day tomorrow.

597
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:19,936
It takes a lot of paperwork
to bring back a man.

598
01:54:21,271 --> 01:54:22,773
Bring you back to life, man.

599
01:54:23,815 --> 01:54:25,692
- Bye, Chuck.
- Take care, now.

600
01:54:25,776 --> 01:54:26,860
Tomorrow.

601
01:54:26,943 --> 01:54:29,446
Tomorrow we're gonna
bring you back to life.

602
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:16,219
How long are you gonna be, man?

603
01:56:18,555 --> 01:56:19,723
Well...

604
01:56:21,308 --> 01:56:24,060
- How long will that buy me?
- About ten minutes.

605
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:49,794
I'm awake.

606
01:56:50,629 --> 01:56:52,631
I saw your taxi drive up.

607
01:56:55,175 --> 01:56:57,302
Get in here out of the rain.

608
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:07,854
I saw you down at the hub today,
so I know you were down there.

609
01:57:27,123 --> 01:57:29,042
Let me get you a towel.

610
01:57:40,971 --> 01:57:42,472
They're sleeping.

611
01:57:46,643 --> 01:57:49,980
You'll come in,
I'll make you some coffee?

612
01:58:02,409 --> 01:58:04,077
It's a nice house.

613
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:05,829
Yeah, we got a nice mortgage, too.

614
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:15,922
What's your daughter's name?

615
01:58:17,007 --> 01:58:18,008
Katie.

616
01:58:19,634 --> 01:58:20,635
Katie.

617
01:58:24,848 --> 01:58:26,600
She's a beautiful little girl.

618
01:58:26,683 --> 01:58:27,976
She's a handful.

619
01:58:42,532 --> 01:58:44,242
Let me get one thing straight.

620
01:58:54,127 --> 01:58:57,505
We have a pro football team now,
but they're in Nashville?

621
01:59:03,011 --> 01:59:06,097
Umm, yeah. Oh, my God. Okay.

622
01:59:06,681 --> 01:59:08,058
They used to be in Houston.

623
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:11,686
First they were the Otters,
and now they're the Titans.

624
01:59:12,395 --> 01:59:15,065
The Houston Otters
are the Tennessee Titans?

625
01:59:15,565 --> 01:59:18,401
Yeah. But that's not all.

626
01:59:19,027 --> 01:59:21,655
They went to the Super Bowl last year.

627
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:24,824
- And I missed that.
- You would've died.

628
01:59:24,908 --> 01:59:28,828
They almost won by one yard.
One lousy yard, right at the end.

629
01:59:30,789 --> 01:59:34,167
I got whole milk, 2% and non-fat.

630
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:37,295
I don't have any half-and-half,
and that's what you like.

631
01:59:37,796 --> 01:59:39,172
That'll do fine.

632
01:59:52,686 --> 01:59:54,938
What happened to you
becoming a professor?

633
01:59:57,565 --> 02:00:00,610
You're not Dr Kelly Frears-Lovett?

634
02:00:03,988 --> 02:00:04,989
When you, um...

635
02:00:06,491 --> 02:00:08,201
When your plane went down,

636
02:00:09,494 --> 02:00:12,038
everything just sort of got put on hold.

637
02:00:14,457 --> 02:00:16,793
I think about taking it up again, though.

638
02:00:29,139 --> 02:00:31,516
I came out here to give you this.

639
02:00:32,684 --> 02:00:34,436
Oh, my God.

640
02:00:36,855 --> 02:00:38,898
I'm sorry it doesn't work.

641
02:00:40,442 --> 02:00:42,819
And I, uh, I kept the picture.

642
02:00:44,446 --> 02:00:46,406
It was all faded anyway.

643
02:00:47,782 --> 02:00:49,993
I want you to have it. I gave it to you.

644
02:00:50,702 --> 02:00:53,997
That's a family heirloom
and it should stay in your family.

645
02:01:03,673 --> 02:01:07,177
That's everything I have
from when you went down to now.

646
02:01:08,762 --> 02:01:11,347
They said they never figured out
what caused the crash.

647
02:01:11,681 --> 02:01:15,226
Probably some mislabelled
hazardous material caught fire.

648
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:21,191
So here's where that ship found you.

649
02:01:22,984 --> 02:01:25,361
You drifted about 500 miles.

650
02:01:26,362 --> 02:01:28,490
This is where your island was,

651
02:01:28,698 --> 02:01:31,701
about 600 miles
south of the Cook Islands.

652
02:01:33,495 --> 02:01:35,747
And these are the search grids.

653
02:01:35,830 --> 02:01:39,167
Ships went back and forth
for weeks looking for you.

654
02:01:47,467 --> 02:01:50,178
I never should've gotten on that plane.

655
02:01:52,096 --> 02:01:54,349
I never should've gotten out of the car.

656
02:01:58,478 --> 02:02:00,438
I wanna show you something.

657
02:02:02,524 --> 02:02:03,691
Come here.

658
02:02:13,952 --> 02:02:16,079
This is... This is our car.

659
02:02:18,414 --> 02:02:20,375
You kept our car.

660
02:02:22,544 --> 02:02:24,546
All right, now...

661
02:02:25,004 --> 02:02:26,506
This is weird.

662
02:02:34,264 --> 02:02:35,807
It's a good car.

663
02:02:36,432 --> 02:02:38,852
Had a lot of memories in this car.

664
02:02:38,935 --> 02:02:40,728
Two very nice memories.

665
02:02:41,604 --> 02:02:44,232
Oh, that trip down to the Gulf, yeah.

666
02:02:46,234 --> 02:02:47,944
So, can I drive it?

667
02:02:48,361 --> 02:02:49,904
It's your car.

668
02:02:58,037 --> 02:03:00,999
That's good, 'cause my...
My taxi's gone.

669
02:03:07,171 --> 02:03:08,214
Um...

670
02:03:09,591 --> 02:03:11,843
Let me get some stuff out of the back.

671
02:03:34,073 --> 02:03:36,576
You think you're gonna have more kids?

672
02:03:36,659 --> 02:03:37,994
I don't know.

673
02:03:38,328 --> 02:03:40,747
It's kind of confusing right now.

674
02:03:41,623 --> 02:03:42,999
Well, you should.

675
02:03:44,167 --> 02:03:46,419
I mean, really, you should.

676
02:03:48,671 --> 02:03:49,672
I would.

677
02:03:52,675 --> 02:03:54,302
So, what now?

678
02:03:57,722 --> 02:03:59,182
I don't know.

679
02:04:02,268 --> 02:04:04,020
I really don't know.

680
02:04:16,699 --> 02:04:18,701
You said you'd be right back.

681
02:04:23,957 --> 02:04:25,750
I'm so sorry.

682
02:04:27,794 --> 02:04:29,003
Me, too.

683
02:05:39,115 --> 02:05:40,116
Chuck!

684
02:05:44,662 --> 02:05:45,705
Chuck!

685
02:05:47,290 --> 02:05:48,583
Chuck!

686
02:06:07,226 --> 02:06:09,437
I always knew you were alive.
I knew it.

687
02:06:11,189 --> 02:06:13,232
But everybody said
I had to stop saying that,

688
02:06:13,316 --> 02:06:14,692
that I had to let you go.

689
02:06:16,819 --> 02:06:18,196
I love you.

690
02:06:20,114 --> 02:06:22,158
You're the love of my life.

691
02:06:24,327 --> 02:06:26,120
I love you, too, Kelly.

692
02:06:28,247 --> 02:06:29,832
More than you'll ever know.

693
02:07:30,768 --> 02:07:31,769
Chuck?

694
02:07:39,652 --> 02:07:41,404
You have to go home.

695
02:08:30,786 --> 02:08:36,542
We both had done the math,
and Kelly added it all up.

696
02:08:39,295 --> 02:08:41,047
She knew she had to let me go.

697
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:43,799
I added it up, knew that I'd...

698
02:08:45,676 --> 02:08:46,844
I'd lost her.

699
02:08:49,597 --> 02:08:52,391
'Cause I was never gonna
get off that island.

700
02:08:54,644 --> 02:08:58,481
I was gonna die there, totally alone.

701
02:09:05,571 --> 02:09:09,033
I mean, I was gonna get sick or
I was gonna get injured or something.

702
02:09:12,745 --> 02:09:14,622
The only choice I had,

703
02:09:17,333 --> 02:09:19,752
the only thing I could control

704
02:09:21,754 --> 02:09:24,131
was when and how

705
02:09:25,424 --> 02:09:28,135
and where
that was gonna happen. So...

706
02:09:30,471 --> 02:09:32,139
I made a rope.

707
02:09:34,850 --> 02:09:37,687
And I went up to the summit
to hang myself.

708
02:09:41,357 --> 02:09:43,359
But I had to test it, you know?

709
02:09:43,442 --> 02:09:45,861
Of course. You know me.

710
02:09:48,572 --> 02:09:53,703
And the weight of the log
snapped the limb of the tree.

711
02:09:53,828 --> 02:09:58,291
So I couldn't even kill myself
the way I wanted to.

712
02:09:58,374 --> 02:10:01,168
I had power over nothing.

713
02:10:10,011 --> 02:10:13,597
And that's when this feeling came
over me like a warm blanket.

714
02:10:17,643 --> 02:10:20,396
I knew, somehow,

715
02:10:22,189 --> 02:10:24,525
that I had to stay alive.

716
02:10:25,901 --> 02:10:27,236
Somehow.

717
02:10:28,946 --> 02:10:31,240
I had to keep breathing,

718
02:10:33,826 --> 02:10:36,579
even though
there was no reason to hope.

719
02:10:37,997 --> 02:10:41,667
And all my logic said that
I would never see this place again.

720
02:10:46,589 --> 02:10:48,424
So that's what I did.

721
02:10:49,508 --> 02:10:50,968
I stayed alive.

722
02:10:52,136 --> 02:10:53,888
I kept breathing.

723
02:10:56,349 --> 02:10:58,684
Then one day
that logic was proven all wrong,

724
02:10:58,768 --> 02:11:03,439
because the tide came in,

725
02:11:03,731 --> 02:11:05,608
gave me a sail.

726
02:11:09,904 --> 02:11:11,614
And now, here I am.

727
02:11:15,076 --> 02:11:19,163
I'm back in Memphis,

728
02:11:19,372 --> 02:11:21,290
talking to you.

729
02:11:22,875 --> 02:11:24,794
I have ice in my glass.

730
02:11:32,009 --> 02:11:34,387
And I've lost her all over again.

731
02:11:42,228 --> 02:11:44,688
I'm so sad that I don't have Kelly.

732
02:11:49,902 --> 02:11:53,739
But I'm so grateful that
she was with me on that island.

733
02:12:00,287 --> 02:12:02,832
And I know what I have to do now.

734
02:12:05,584 --> 02:12:07,503
I gotta keep breathing.

735
02:12:10,172 --> 02:12:12,675
Because tomorrow, the sun will rise.

736
02:12:13,843 --> 02:12:16,095
Who knows what the tide could bring?

737
02:13:22,161 --> 02:13:23,329
Hello!

738
02:13:28,375 --> 02:13:29,376
Hello!

739
02:13:38,052 --> 02:13:39,220
FedEx!

740
02:14:47,830 --> 02:14:49,081
You look lost.

741
02:14:49,582 --> 02:14:50,583
I do?

742
02:14:51,625 --> 02:14:53,002
Where are you headed?

743
02:14:57,047 --> 02:14:58,924
Well, I was just about to figure that out.

744
02:15:00,509 --> 02:15:01,885
Well, that's 83 South.

745
02:15:02,678 --> 02:15:05,806
And this road here will hook you up
with I-40 East.

746
02:15:07,349 --> 02:15:10,936
If you turn right, that'll take you to

747
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:14,565
Amarillo, Flagstaff, California.

748
02:15:17,151 --> 02:15:19,778
And if you head back that direction,
you'll find a whole lot of nothing

749
02:15:19,862 --> 02:15:21,614
all the way to Canada.

750
02:15:24,283 --> 02:15:25,534
I got it.

751
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:27,536
All right, then.

752
02:15:30,539 --> 02:15:32,041
Good luck, cowboy.

753
02:15:32,791 --> 02:15:33,917
Thank you.
