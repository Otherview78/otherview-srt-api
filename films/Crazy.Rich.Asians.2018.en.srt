1
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,232
Be careful of your fingers.

2
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,156
May I help you?

3
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,956
This is the Calthorpe.

4
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,872
Private hotel.

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,071
I'm Mrs. Eleanor Young.

6
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,717
I have a reservation. The Lancaster Suite.

7
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,351
We spoke on the phone when I confirmed yesterday.

8
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,354
Sorry, don't seem to have your reservation.

9
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,876
Good evening.

10
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,112
I'm Reginald Ormsby, hotel manager. Is there a problem?

11
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,713
I'm Mrs. Eleanor Young.

12
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,197
My family and I would like to be shown to our suite.

13
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,039
We've had a long flight.

14
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,152
We're fully booked, madam.

15
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,674
You must have made a mistake.

16
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,232
I'm sure you and your lovely family can find other accommodation.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,674
May I suggest you explore Chinatown?

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,954
Please, may I use your phone to call my husband?

19
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,879
It's the least you can do.

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,675
Mmm.

21
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,037
Mrs. Young, I must ask you to leave or I'll have to call the police.

22
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,594
Please, go right ahead.

23
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,033
Lord Calthorpe, my apologies for the disturbance.

24
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,875
Eleanor! I just got off the phone with your husband.

25
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,236
Get the Lancaster Suite ready. Now.

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,240
Surely you're joking, sir.

27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,909
I assure you, I'm not.

28
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,399
As of this evening,

29
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,078
my family's long history as custodians of the Calthorpe is ended.

30
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,239
I'm selling the hotel to my dear friends,

31
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,471
the Young family of Singapore.

32
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,273
Meet the new lady of the house, Eleanor Young.

33
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,275
Join me for a toast.

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,874
We'd be delighted.

35
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,789
Do get a mop. The floor's wet.

36
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,080
Get a mop.

37
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,159
I'm all in.

38
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,674
Fold.

39
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,436
Nothing?

40
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,320
This whole time you had nothing?

41
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
All right, so...

42
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,991
How did I beat TA Curtis so very, very badly?

43
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,870
Well, I know for a fact that Curtis is cheap.

44
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,229
So he's not playing using logic or math, but using his psychology.

45
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,560
Our brains so hate the idea of losing something that's valuable to us

46
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,156
that we abandon all rational thought, and we make some really poor decisions.

47
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,799
So, Curtis wasn't playing to win.

48
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,792
He was playing not to lose.

49
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,680
Here. Put it towards a haircut.

50
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,317
All right, that's it for today.

51
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,639
Don't forget your essays on conditional probability are due next week.

52
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,074
Yes!

53
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,479
You know what? You can order your own.

54
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,313
Mmm. I'm okay with coffee. Thanks.

55
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,120
Yeah, well, you always say that,

56
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,113
and then you end up eating all my dessert.

57
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,016
I don't know what you're talking about.

58
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,776
- 'Cause I have, like, a tiny bit. - Uh-huh.

59
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,269
Okay. Can we have one more of these, please? Thank you.

60
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,159
So, what about us taking an adventure east?

61
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,112
You wanna get pork buns in the East Village.

62
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,675
That's what it is, isn't it?

63
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,472
I was actually thinking of further east.

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Like Queens?

65
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,790
Like Singapore. For spring break.

66
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,470
Colin's wedding.

67
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,216
We've been dating for over a year now,

68
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,119
and I think it's about time people met my beautiful girlfriend.

69
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,671
Come on, I'm Colin's best man.

70
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,520
Don't you wanna see where I grew up?

71
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,229
Meet my family, my Ah Ma?

72
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,560
And meet up with that strange college roommate of yours.

73
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,314
- Peik Lin. - Mmm-hmm.

74
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,696
- Peik Lin. - She has been begging me

75
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,840
to come visit her, you know.

76
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,834
The universe has spoken. It wants you over there.

77
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Come to Singapore.

78
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,958
I want the whole island to meet the brilliant Rachel Chu.

79
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,756
Aww.

80
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,919
"If then you have been raised with Christ,

81
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,912
"seek the things that are above

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,920
"where Christ is seated

83
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,912
"at the right hand of God.

84
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,033
"Set your minds on things that are above,

85
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,680
"not on things that are on Earth."

86
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,318
Eleanor, is Nicki bringing a girl to Colin's wedding?

87
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,917
My Amanda heard it from her friend Francesca.

88
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,556
Eddie says her name is Rachel Chu.

89
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,235
Oh, I thought that Nick was coming alone.

90
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,119
Did you know he had a girlfriend?

91
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,911
Nick dates many girls. It's hard to keep track.

92
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,319
Amanda knows everyone and she has never heard of her.

93
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,196
Rachel Chu.

94
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,759
Maybe she's from the Taiwan plastics Chu family.

95
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,879
If you want, I have a private investigator.

96
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Very discreet.

97
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,040
I think we should return to the word of God.

98
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,550
Alix.

99
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,555
Ephesians. Chapter six, verse four.

100
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,517
"Bring up your children in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."

101
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,432
Oh, I do hope she's a good Christian girl.

102
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,776
Well, if he's bringing her home, it must be serious.

103
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Exactly.

104
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,356
- Oh, it's my mum. Do you mind? - Mmm, go ahead.

105
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,875
- All right. Save me some of that. - Okay.

106
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,033
Hey, Mum, everything okay?

107
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,074
Does something have to be wrong for me to call?

108
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,913
Yeah, usually.

109
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,230
Very funny.

110
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,639
Are you bringing the girl you're seeing to Colin's wedding?

111
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,150
Hmm.

112
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,516
We were literally just talking about that.

113
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
How could you know?

114
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,640
Everybody knows.

115
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,155
Radio One Asia.

116
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,355
Move on to Corinthians. I'll catch up.

117
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,794
Yes.

118
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,160
We're looking forward to having you home.

119
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,075
And your room is all ready for you.

120
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,280
Thanks, Mum.

121
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,079
But Rachel and I will be staying together.

122
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,395
I see.

123
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,233
Well, I'm having the house re-done.

124
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,153
And it's not ready for guests.

125
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,711
If Rachel comes, I think she might be more comfortable

126
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,519
staying somewhere else.

127
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,636
- All right, sorry about that. - I saved you a piece.

128
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,394
You did, did you? A very small piece at that.

129
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,630
Thank you very much.

130
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,437
How's your mom? Everything okay?

131
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,193
Couldn't be better.

132
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,296
Hey, Mom, this one's kind of cute.

133
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,391
- What do you think? - No! No!

134
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,756
You can't wear that to meet Nick's Ah Ma.

135
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,275
Blue and white is for Chinese funerals.

136
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,717
Now this, this symbolizes good fortune and fertility.

137
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,711
Great! I was really going for that "lucky baby maker" vibe.

138
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,593
Hey! You're the one who asked for my help

139
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,632
picking out a dress to meet Nick's family.

140
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
It's only 'cause I hardly know anything about them.

141
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,920
Every time I bring them up, Nick changes the subject.

142
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,474
Maybe he's embarrassed.

143
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,081
Maybe his parents are poor, and he has to send them money.

144
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,833
That's what all good Chinese children do.

145
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,550
You're going to have a wonderful time.

146
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,393
You've always wanted to go to Asia.

147
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,599
And who knows, if all goes well in Singapore,

148
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,399
you might just come back with a souvenir.

149
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,551
Mom, stop!

150
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,520
Nick and I haven't even talked about that.

151
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,555
I mean, his parents can't not like me, right?

152
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,953
What was that look? I saw that.

153
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,714
Nothing. It's just, Nick

154
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,792
bringing a girl all the way there to meet them

155
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,839
can mean a lot to these overseas families. They're different from us.

156
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,391
How are they different? They're Chinese, I'm Chinese.

157
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,077
I'm so Chinese, I'm an economics professor

158
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,594
with lactose intolerance.

159
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,754
Yeah, but you grew up here.

160
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,400
You're different.

161
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,516
But wearing a lucky color will make a good first impression.

162
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,149
Okay, game plan.

163
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,757
Check our bags, get through security and then

164
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,231
we could eat one of the three homemade Tupperware meals my mom packed for us.

165
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,279
Good afternoon, Mr. Young, Miss Chu.

166
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,456
We'll take your bags and get you checked into first class.

167
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,597
- Great. - Oh, no, there's a mistake.

168
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,956
We're not first class. We're economy people.

169
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,576
This way, please.

170
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,478
Just go with it. Come on.

171
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,920
But...

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,037
Yeah, they'll be fine. Just leave them there.

173
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,753
Welcome aboard, Mr. Young, Miss Chu.

174
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,874
Here's the way to your private suite.

175
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,159
And some champagne.

176
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,034
Thank you.

177
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,359
- Thank you very much. - You're welcome.

178
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,511
After takeoff, would you like to enjoy the lounge chairs

179
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,176
or should we convert your suite into a bedroom?

180
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,316
Uh...

181
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,800
We're good. Thank you.

182
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,515
Enjoy.

183
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,237
- Nick. We can't afford this. - Mmm.

184
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,034
These pajamas are fancier than any of my real clothes.

185
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,749
My family has business with the airline. The tickets, they're a perk.

186
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,276
What kind of business?

187
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,710
Real estate, investment, other things. Nothing interesting.

188
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,553
"Dim sum."

189
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,675
So your family is, like, rich?

190
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,076
We're comfortable.

191
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,318
That is exactly what a super-rich person would say.

192
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,832
It's not a big deal, obviously. I just

193
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,560
think it's kind of weird that I had no idea.

194
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,839
I mean, you have a Jamba Juice card.

195
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,953
You use my Netflix password.

196
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,595
You play basketball at that Y that kind of smells.

197
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,677
I really like that place, thank you very much.

198
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,876
And yes, my family has money, but I've always thought of it as theirs.

199
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Not mine.

200
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,479
I get that. But I'm going all the way over there to meet them.

201
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,391
Kind of just wanna know what I'm getting into.

202
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,358
And, you know, they're your family.

203
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,320
Well...

204
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,951
- My family is much like anybody else's. - Mmm-hmm.

205
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,555
There's half of them that you love and respect,

206
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,758
and then there's the other half.

207
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,390
Which half am I meeting?

208
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,234
Well, there's my cousin Alistair, based in Taiwan, works in movies.

209
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,480
And cut!

210
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,470
He's dating Kitty Pong, an actress.

211
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,120
- Kitty. - Alistair.

212
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,480
You like it? I was feeling very, very the emotions. Can you feel it?

213
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,359
Oh, I can feel all of you. And all of me.

214
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,136
Okay, and what about your cousin Eddie?

215
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,480
You don't ever talk about him.

216
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,956
Well, Eddie's a big finance guy in Hong Kong.

217
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
A real family man.

218
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,496
You know, if you move, it will look more natural.

219
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,637
No, this way you get our optimal angles.

220
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,158
Then we're done.

221
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,311
Russel, thank you so much. It's an honor to be photographed by you.

222
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,472
My pleasure. People will love it in the next Hong Kong Vogue.

223
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,997
Thank you, Russel.

224
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,479
Hong Kong Vogue? I knew it. Your dress is a disaster.

225
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,440
If you wore the Bottega gown like I told you to,

226
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,536
we'd be in the American Vogue.

227
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,438
You can wear that gown to Hell, Eddie.

228
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,557
Stop!

229
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,680
Then there's Astrid.

230
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,752
Ah, I remember Astrid.

231
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,520
She's like who I wanna be when I grow up.

232
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,354
Astrid is awesome.

233
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,976
And she's probably the only one I'm actually close with.

234
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,656
And she's really grounded and down-to-earth,

235
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,239
once you get to know her.

236
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,115
Not only did she graduate top of her class at Oxford,

237
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,393
start multiple charities, and is a fashion icon,

238
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,598
Astrid has the biggest heart of any of my cousins.

239
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,120
- Mummy? See what I made for bunny? - No, not now.

240
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,080
Hi, I'm Astrid. What's your name?

241
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Vita.

242
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,150
And who's this?

243
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,310
Bun-Bun.

244
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,277
Well, I think Bun-Bun looks very dashing with his bow. You have a good eye.

245
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
Thank you.

246
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,996
Miss Leong, right this way.

247
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,440
It's very nice to meet you both.

248
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,592
These are all brand-new from Antwerp.

249
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,199
You're the first person I've shown them to.

250
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
What are those?

251
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,629
Those?

252
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,271
Those are very special.

253
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,792
Burmese pearl drop earrings.

254
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,319
Set with emeralds, and rare pigeon blood-red rubies.

255
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,036
They were worn by Queen Supayalat at her self-anointed coronation in 1878.

256
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,759
How much?

257
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,631
Having you wear one of my pieces is better publicity than I can buy.

258
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,400
I'll let them go at cost.

259
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
1.2 million.

260
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,360
So, if you have all this family there, why are we staying in a hotel?

261
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,832
Aren't good Chinese sons supposed to stay with their parents?

262
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,712
Well, because A, I'm not that good a son.

263
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,354
And B...

264
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,755
I just want you to myself, just for a bit.

265
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
That okay?

266
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,035
Okay.

267
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,431
God, I can't believe this airport has a butterfly garden

268
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,477
and a movie theater.

269
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,314
JFK is just salmonella and despair.

270
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,757
Nick! Nick!

271
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
Araminta!

272
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,679
- I missed you. - I missed you, too.

273
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,195
- Rachel. - Hi.

274
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,193
- There he is. - It's so nice to finally meet you.

275
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,794
It's so nice to meet you, too.

276
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,270
- Ah, Nicki-Nick! - It's been too long, brother.

277
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,238
It has been too long. Welcome back.

278
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,056
- You guys didn't have to pick us up. - Of course, we did. We had to.

279
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,515
Of course, I had to come welcome my best man properly.

280
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,480
- Hi, Rachel. - Hello.

281
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,553
- Oh, lovely to finally meet you. - Nice to meet you, too.

282
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,056
- Shall we? Let me help you with this. - Yes.

283
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,336
- These are for you. - I can grab these.

284
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,776
I know they're a bit over-the-top.

285
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,896
- Let's get you guys localized. - Are you hungry?

286
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,914
I'm always hungry. So let's eat everything we can.

287
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,720
Welcome to heaven on Earth!

288
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,634
I hope you're hungry. I am bloody starving.

289
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,399
Guys! Here! Whoo!

290
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,080
Come with me.

291
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,669
Each of these hawker stalls sells pretty much one dish.

292
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,911
And they've been perfecting it for generations.

293
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,176
You know, this is one of the only places in the world

294
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,999
where street food vendors actually earn Michelin stars.

295
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,119
- Hey! How are you? - Uncle.

296
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,429
Long time no see, my friend.

297
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,559
Here you go. Thank you very much, sir.

298
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,276
- Look at this. Look at this. - My favorite.

299
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,990
Mmm.

300
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,536
- One of those for you. - Yes, thank you.

301
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,519
Looks a little vomity.

302
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,154
- Oh, my God! - Yes?

303
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,874
I told you. I told you.

304
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,376
- Best satay on the island for sure. - So yummy, isn't it?

305
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,516
All right, dig in, guys.

306
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,512
Oh, before I forget, I need your help tomorrow.

307
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,080
Uh, I need to do some groomsmen stuff

308
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,077
and I don't wanna do it alone with Bernard Tai.

309
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,274
I still cannot believe that you got that guy to be your groomsman.

310
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,795
- Thank you. Thank you. I rest my case. - Minty...

311
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,191
Well, it wasn't up to me, was it? It's not my choice.

312
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,078
Bernard is the human douche nozzle

313
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,629
who used to steal my tuck shop money when we were kids.

314
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,559
Until Nicki-Nick beat him up.

315
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,560
- Well... - You beat somebody up?

316
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,040
I threw a single punch.

317
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,191
I fell on the floor and the guy sat on me.

318
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,789
So, wasn't really much of a fight.

319
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,715
A toast, guys.

320
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,950
To my best man, Nick Young, who can't fight for nuts,

321
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,272
but will always have your back.

322
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,917
- A toast to married life. - To...

323
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,311
- Not yet! Not yet! Too early. - Oh, God!

324
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,576
Well, this time next week, guys!

325
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,256
We gotta get over your bachelor party first, matey.

326
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,317
Is that necessary, man? Come on!

327
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,279
Listen, Rachel, I know we've only just met.

328
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,477
But it's my bachelorette party this weekend

329
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,920
and I would love for you to come.

330
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,717
- That'll be amazing. Thank you so much! - Good! Good!

331
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,439
- Am I out of the picture? - Thanks, man.

332
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,336
- Am I totally out of the picture? - Yes, I've replaced you with Bernard.

333
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,272
Screw that, man.

334
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,317
Also, I have to say, I can't remember the last time I saw Nick like this.

335
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,320
That's funny, though.

336
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,474
He's just happy to be home.

337
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,712
Oh, yeah, he's just happy to be home.

338
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,235
With you.

339
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,359
Your dad will be the death of you.

340
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,121
My dad will be the death of me. Oh, cheers to that.

341
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,113
Guys, we have to dig in

342
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,919
'cause this crab is not gonna eat itself.

343
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,195
What should I try first?

344
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,760
- Try some of this. Oh, thank you. - Do you want some of this?

345
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,936
- It's really spicy. - It is really spicy.

346
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,120
Whoo!

347
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,113
Nick's in Singapore!

348
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,680
It's good to be home.

349
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,656
- Is Michael here? - Not yet, ma'am.

350
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,070
Also, your son woke up. He wants to see you.

351
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,514
All right.

352
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,876
You know what to do. Quickly.

353
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,592
I'm sorry. Got stuck in a meeting.

354
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,280
It's okay. I get it.

355
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,576
But don't forget, wedding festivities start on Wednesday.

356
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,240
- So no emergencies next week. - I know.

357
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,797
Wouldn't dream of missing a second with your family and their friends.

358
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,309
Come on, it won't be all bad.

359
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,439
Nick and his new girlfriend will be there.

360
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
You'll like her.

361
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,351
Oh, yeah? Why?

362
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,433
'Cause she's a commoner like me?

363
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,319
You know that's not what I meant.

364
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,876
Ooh.

365
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,873
You know, I thought I caught the maids

366
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,550
trying to shove a pair of Jimmy Choos behind a dryer.

367
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,110
Yeah, I don't know why you bother trying to hide your shopping from me.

368
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,080
You can buy whatever you want.

369
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,754
I get it.

370
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,551
Besides, everybody knows you wear the money pants in this family.

371
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,196
Pants are overrated.

372
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,749
Oh, I got you something, too.

373
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,316
To celebrate the launch of your startup.

374
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,719
I know you don't like expensive gifts,

375
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,110
but you're not a captain in the army anymore.

376
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,279
You're a CEO. You should look the part.

377
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,278
I love it. Thank you.

378
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,160
Mmm.

379
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,356
What time is it?

380
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,510
Morning.

381
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,080
I'm afraid it's time for me to do some groomsman duties.

382
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,391
Stay in bed.

383
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,835
You stay here. I'll get you a breakfast tray.

384
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,070
You know what? I should get up, too.

385
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,117
I told Peik Lin I would meet up with her today.

386
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,556
Ah, a little college reunion. But don't forget.

387
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,016
- Dinner at Ah Ma's tonight. - Mmm-hmm.

388
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,416
- The whole family's gonna be there. - Yes.

389
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,477
I can't wait to show you off.

390
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Hubba, hubba.

391
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
How can I resist?

392
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,430
Ooga-ooga.

393
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,071
You put those glasses on on purpose.

394
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,313
New York in the house!

395
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,315
Yeah! Yeah!

396
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,198
Oh, Peik Lin!

397
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,031
What up, bitch? Yeah!

398
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,472
Oh, my God! You look amazing.

399
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,199
I know. Some things never change, right?

400
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,035
And this is quite a place.

401
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,671
Astor! Vanderbilt! Rockefeller!

402
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,680
Naughty, naughty boys. Stop barking.

403
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,317
- Hey, Rachel! - Hi!

404
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,991
Singapore is so hot. Come in and enjoy the aircon. Come on.

405
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,198
Whole family waiting to meet you. Very excited.

406
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,474
Rachel, welcome, welcome.

407
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,233
Wow! Oh, my gosh! Your house is amazing, Mrs. Goh.

408
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,712
Call me Auntie. Auntie Neenah.

409
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,040
Sorry. Auntie Neenah.

410
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,240
Oh, yeah.

411
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,911
We were inspired by the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles.

412
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,953
And Donald Trump's bathroom.

413
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,515
- Really? - Yeah.

414
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,390
You like it or not?

415
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,354
Oh, yes.

416
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,877
The gold is very brilliant.

417
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,238
Rachel Chu, we are so grateful

418
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,317
for all the help you have given my Peik Lin back in her uni days.

419
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,274
I mean, without you, she would be a hot mess.

420
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,672
Oh, my God, no. Actually...

421
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,998
If it wasn't for her, I'd be a big mess. She was a huge help to me in college.

422
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,720
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Goh.

423
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,198
Nice to meet you, too, Chu.

424
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,399
Ku-ku. Ku-Chu. You. Poo-poo.

425
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,736
No, I'm just kidding.

426
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,274
I don't have an accent.

427
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,600
I'm just messing with you.

428
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,433
No, I studied in the States, too.

429
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,034
Yeah, Cal State Fullerton.

430
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,074
- I majored in Thought. - Mmm.

431
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,190
Don't stand on ceremony, Rachel. This is simple food, lah.

432
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,430
Ah, cha, cha, cha!

433
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,040
Don't be shy.

434
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,240
- Oh. Thank you. - You're not a model.

435
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,676
I'm definitely not.

436
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,355
No, you're not. Not at all. Far from it.

437
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,680
- I know. - Make sure you eat it all.

438
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,440
'Cause I'm watching you.

439
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,600
- Okay, thank you. - Okay, yeah.

440
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,236
- Ah Pa, can we go trampoline? - Go trampoline?

441
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,472
You haven't finished your nuggets yet, sweetie.

442
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,599
Okay, there's a lot of children starving in America, right?

443
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,555
I mean, take a look at her. She's American. Huh.

444
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,360
Really skinny. You wanna look like that?

445
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,440
- No. - No.

446
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,636
Then eat your nuggets!

447
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,910
So, Rachel, what you do in America?

448
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,070
Um...

449
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,879
I'm an economics professor.

450
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,155
Whoa.

451
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,993
Very impressive. Econ professor, eh?

452
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,640
Wow, you must be very smart. Good for you.

453
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,434
Let me get this straight. You both went to the same school.

454
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,355
Yet someone came back with a degree that's useful.

455
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,513
And the other one came back as Asian Ellen.

456
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
Psst, P.T.

457
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,474
Look over here. She's a hottie.

458
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,029
This is the kind of girl you should date.

459
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,155
Smart, beautiful. Not those like K-Pop skanks

460
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,950
with no brain, big eyes and small backsides.

461
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,713
She has an amazing backside.

462
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,552
This is Goh standard. Don't be shy. Just talk to her.

463
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,316
- I love you. - Okay. No, just...

464
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,240
Pa, she's here with her boyfriend.

465
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,199
I don't see no ring on her finger.

466
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,616
Oh, well, my boyfriend's actually from Singapore and that's why we're here.

467
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,632
We're here to go to his best friend's wedding,

468
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,040
where he's gonna be the best man.

469
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,469
Mmm.

470
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,630
What's his name?

471
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,394
This is a very small island. Maybe we know his family.

472
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,876
His name is Nick Young.

473
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,430
Uh...

474
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,318
The Nick you're dating is Nick Young?

475
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,754
His best friend...

476
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,836
You're invited to Colin Khoo's wedding?

477
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,674
Yeah. You guys know them or something?

478
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,189
Hells yeah.

479
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,672
The Khoos, the Youngs. I mean, who doesn't know who they are?

480
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,799
They're just the biggest developers

481
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,712
...in all of Singapore.

482
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,590
And Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei, New Mexico.

483
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,680
She gets it.

484
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,356
Colin and Araminta's wedding is Singapore's event of the century.

485
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,000
The Youngs are like royalty.

486
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,393
Did you not know? Does she not know?

487
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,437
Why you never say before?

488
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,399
Tell, tell, what are they like?

489
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,074
I don't really know what they're...

490
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,231
I haven't met them yet. I'm gonna meet them tonight.

491
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,496
I'm going to Nick's grandma's house.

492
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,438
You're going to Nick's grandma's house wearing this? Wearing that?

493
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,240
No way. No way.

494
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,437
Yeah, I thought red was a lucky color, right?

495
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,400
Yeah. If you're an envelope. Zing! Nailed it!

496
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,637
Zing!

497
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,715
Rachel, these people aren't just rich, okay?

498
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,439
They're crazy rich. Look.

499
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,440
There's new money all over Asia.

500
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,200
We got the Beijing billionaires, the Taiwan tycoons,

501
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,317
but the Young family, they're old money rich.

502
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,791
They had money when they left China in the 1800s.

503
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,669
And they went all the way down here.

504
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,076
Not there...

505
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,678
Here. They came to Singapore,

506
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,792
when there was nothing but jungle and pig farmers.

507
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,480
There was a snake here, eating an apple.

508
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,950
You know what I mean? And they built all of this.

509
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,673
Now, they're the landlords of the most

510
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,976
expensive city in the world. Here you go.

511
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,279
These people are so posh and snobby, they're snoshy.

512
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,552
- Here you go. - Yeah, but Nick's not like that.

513
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,355
Even if he isn't, I guarantee you the family is.

514
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Which is why tonight,

515
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,870
you need to not look like Sebastian of The Little Mermaid.

516
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,314
You know, the little crab guy?

517
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,336
Look at this guy, he's sleeping.

518
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,639
Come on, this isn't your grandma's road. God damn it!

519
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,800
Thank you for driving me.

520
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,354
Duh. This is like my one chance

521
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,193
- to see the Young family mansion. - Mmm.

522
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,036
At the next intersection, make a U-turn.

523
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,036
Make a U-turn.

524
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,112
Are you sure you gave me the right address?

525
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,953
The GPS says there's, like, nothing here.

526
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,156
Like, literally nothing.

527
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,912
I don't know why we're here.

528
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,390
I mean, I put in the exact address.

529
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,711
- You copied and you pasted it? - Yeah.

530
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,616
Did you just copy and paste "jungle" and just kind of threw it in there?

531
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,096
- No. This is the address... - Because I feel like that's...

532
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,476
You actually used the... Okay! All right.

533
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,950
- That's a... Hi! So we'll just... - Oh, uh...

534
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,918
Hello, sir. How are you?

535
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,358
We're here for the party, and we're, we come in peace.

536
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,314
Do you know where the Young family house is?

537
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,954
Nicholas Young? I'm Rachel Chu. I'm here to go to his family dinner.

538
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,274
Uh, Rachel Chu for the list. If there is a list.

539
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,736
He's on the phone. He's on the phone.

540
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,797
Is that a gun knife? It's a knife gun.

541
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,591
Okay, and there's a friend. Hi! Very nice to...

542
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,956
We can go through? We're going through? Okay.

543
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,959
Don't stab the car.

544
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,000
Okay, okay. Thank you, bye!

545
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,556
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

546
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,273
Beautiful? It's 200 mil worth of real estate.

547
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,678
It's spectacular.

548
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,636
Damn, Rachel. He's like the Asian Bachelor.

549
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Thanks, brother.

550
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,549
Hello, gorgeous.

551
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,275
Wow!

552
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,399
I think I've just fallen in love with you all over again.

553
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,840
Rachel!

554
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,520
I missed you, too.

555
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,034
- Yeah? - What did you get up to?

556
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,270
Psst.

557
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,636
Rachel!

558
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,599
Oh, uh, this is my friend, Peik Lin.

559
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,669
- Hi, there. - Howdy.

560
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,216
Thank you very much for bringing Rachel.

561
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
Oh, no worries.

562
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,496
Do you wanna stop by for some dinner?

563
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,576
- Oh, no, I couldn't impose. - No, it's not a problem.

564
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,896
- I had some dinner plans. - Seriously, we've got...

565
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,280
Yeah, I'll fucking come to dinner.

566
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,096
- I missed you. - Did you?

567
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,395
- Yes. - How was your day?

568
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,518
It was fun! I got to meet Peik Lin's whole family, her dog.

569
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Nope.

570
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,233
You have a cocktail dress in your trunk?

571
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,510
I'm not an animal, Rachel.

572
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,157
I thought this was just a family thing.

573
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,070
My grandmother's invited some of her friends over tonight.

574
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,359
Her tan huas are blooming. It's a whole thing.

575
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,189
You ready for this?

576
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,112
Oh, damn, Nick. It's a party though. Okay.

577
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,392
The good bathrooms are up the stairs, and you can get changed in there.

578
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,920
Okay, good, I'll find it. Thank you.

579
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,718
You know, when you said you grew up in your grandma's house?

580
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,234
I wasn't expecting this.

581
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
Thank you.

582
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,150
Oh, no, no. Those are for your fingers.

583
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,440
- Thank you very much. - Thank you.

584
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,273
Ah, a little bit much, I know.

585
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,871
I mean, this place is gorgeous. And like the rolling green hills.

586
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,119
I mean, there are armed guards out there.

587
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,517
And a giant tiger.

588
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
Okay.

589
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,275
That is Mr. Harimau.

590
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,076
Now, my great-grandfather actually shot him when he ran into the house.

591
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,632
But Astrid and I, we used to hide cigarettes in his paws.

592
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,709
Do you wanna head in?

593
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,793
Actually, I wanted to bring you over to my mum first.

594
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,076
- Oh. - Come on.

595
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
Mum.

596
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,831
You need a haircut. So unkempt.

597
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,759
And you look tired from your trip.

598
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,509
I'm gonna ask the cook to make you some herbal soup.

599
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,496
I'll send it to the hotel later.

600
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,910
Mum, this is Rachel Chu.

601
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,511
Oh, my gosh! I'm so happy to meet you, Mrs. Young.

602
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,832
Or Auntie. Right?

603
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,999
I'm learning the lingo.

604
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,118
I'm very glad to finally meet you, too.

605
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,796
And I'm sorry Nick's father couldn't be here.

606
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,838
He was called to business in Shanghai.

607
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,119
I told Rachel when duty calls, Dad answers.

608
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
As it should be.

609
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,678
Nick tells me you're a professor, too. What do you teach?

610
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,395
Um, I teach economics.

611
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,479
And she's brilliant. NYU's youngest faculty member.

612
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,110
So, economics...

613
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Sounds challenging.

614
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,512
Are your parents academics as well?

615
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,991
Uh, no. Well, my dad actually died before I was born,

616
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,151
and my mom didn't even go to college.

617
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,953
She actually hardly spoke any English

618
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,037
when she immigrated to the United States.

619
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,796
But she worked really hard, and she studied

620
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,440
and she earned her real estate license

621
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,756
while she was waiting tables to support us.

622
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,040
Now, she likes to say that she's Flushing's top real estate broker.

623
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,150
Self-made woman. She must be so proud of you.

624
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,237
Well, she knows that I'm passionate about what I do

625
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,760
and she's always wanted that for me.

626
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,119
Pursuing one's passion.

627
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,069
How American.

628
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,754
Well, your mother's very open-minded, not like here.

629
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,197
Where parents are obsessed with shaping the life of their children.

630
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,759
- That's dinner. - Go ahead.

631
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,550
I'll be out in a minute. Rachel, it was lovely meeting you.

632
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,393
Thank you. You, too.

633
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,994
Okay, she hates me.

634
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,879
She takes a little minute to warm up,

635
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,633
- but we'll get there. - A minute?

636
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,431
- Nicki! Rachel! - Astrid.

637
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,675
Hey. Good to see you.

638
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,416
I'm so glad you could make it.

639
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,476
- Michael. - Nick.

640
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,320
Astrid. So good to see a face I know.

641
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,914
This is my husband, Michael.

642
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,117
Nice to meet you. Heard so much about you.

643
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,680
Nice to meet you, Michael.

644
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,275
Hey, the golden boy's back! Nick!

645
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,717
And you must be Rachel.

646
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,951
I'm Edison Cheng. This is my wife.

647
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,520
- Hi. I'm... - Her name is Fiona.

648
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,071
I see you've already met Princess Astrid and her little soldier toy-boy, Mikey.

649
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,798
You know, Mikey is a big-shot tech startup guy.

650
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,714
So if you forget your password, he's your man.

651
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,715
So you're from the Taiwan plastic Chus, right?

652
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,676
Can I punch him in the face? Just once.

653
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,480
Take a number.

654
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,200
I'll be in my usual corner. Champagne?

655
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,795
Thank you.

656
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,080
So, have you prepped Rachel to face the wolves?

657
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,760
Rachel is a New Yorker.

658
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,800
She lectures millennials for a living. I think she'll manage our family.

659
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,670
You've been away too long.

660
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,470
Okay, sorry, time out. So you're not from a Taiwan Chu family?

661
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,835
Nope.

662
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,071
- Hong Kong telecom Chus? - No.

663
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,358
Malaysian packing peanut Chus?

664
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,715
Is that really a thing?

665
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,951
- Yeah, it's everywhere. - I'm gonna stop you there.

666
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,640
Because I'm gonna take her on the rounds.

667
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,440
- We'll be back, though. - No, wait. Hang on.

668
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,155
China instant noodle Chus. Rachel...

669
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,836
Chu are you?

670
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,756
This is Auntie Alix and Auntie Felicity.

671
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,838
Hi! It's so nice to meet you.

672
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,116
I've never been to a tan hua party before.

673
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,871
We love any excuse to throw a soiree.

674
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,360
Do your parents like to entertain?

675
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,595
Oh, I'm sorry. Your mother's single.

676
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,510
Yup.

677
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,589
Auntie Jacqueline. One of my parents' oldest friends.

678
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,033
I actually met Nick's father at Cambridge.

679
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,510
So, what line of work is your father in?

680
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,032
Oh, my father died before I was born.

681
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,238
But he was a factory worker in China.

682
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,230
Nicki?

683
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,393
This is Ling Cheh, my old nanny.

684
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,040
Look, now's the time we need all hands on deck.

685
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,993
Please, just do me this favor.

686
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,840
Thank you. Bye-bye.

687
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,796
They started clearing away dinner.

688
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,280
Your favorites.

689
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,194
Thank you.

690
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,696
You know if you need bodies at the office,

691
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,160
I could always come in and help out.

692
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,152
The glamorous Astrid Leong

693
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,197
- working as an assistant? - Mmm-hmm.

694
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,194
Wait, isn't Araminta's bachelorette party tomorrow?

695
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,190
And this will be the perfect excuse to get out of it.

696
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,317
Thank you. Really.

697
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,279
But I've got everything covered.

698
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,640
Okay.

699
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,833
I forgot to get you a fork.

700
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,400
It's okay, you stay. I'll go get it.

701
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,069
Michael, I think it's the office.

702
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,799
Oh, my God! Nick, I can't believe I just did that.

703
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,190
It's fine. I don't think anybody even noticed.

704
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,856
I think I freaked out your nanny.

705
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,475
- Oh, my God! - Oh, my God!

706
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,136
- So sorry. - It's fine, don't worry about it.

707
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,389
Can I have a tissue please?

708
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,279
Go, go. Get changed. I'll keep Rachel company.

709
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,238
Thank you, Oli. You're in good hands.

710
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,834
Give me two minutes. I'll change.

711
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,990
Sorry.

712
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,160
Hi, I'm Rachel.

713
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,356
Oh, I know.

714
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,160
Rachel! Rachel!

715
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,800
I heard you thought Ah Ma was the cook!

716
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,677
Ahh!

717
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,355
On the bright side, you're the talk of the party.

718
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,596
People like your dress.

719
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,991
- Oh, I did that. I know! - Oh.

720
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,716
- Such a chic '70s goddess. - I know.

721
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,315
It's very disco Cleopatra, but in a good way.

722
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,856
That's exactly what I was going for.

723
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,679
Ah, well. Oliver.

724
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,194
- Hi. - I like your shoes.

725
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,749
- Oh, thank you. I'm Peik Lin. Ditto. - Cheers.

726
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,875
Gosh, these are lovely.

727
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,136
They're clip-ons. Thank you.

728
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,196
Are they? Wow!

729
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,316
- So, Oliver, are you a cousin, too? - Mmm.

730
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,040
Mmm. Well, I'm one of the poorer relations.

731
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,554
The rainbow sheep of the family.

732
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,950
But I make myself useful.

733
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,556
Whatever the Youngs want, I procure.

734
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,873
Golden koi fish, huanghuali furniture. A rare Cambodian gong.

735
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,669
Why would they want to buy a rare Cambodian gong?

736
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,314
Because they can.

737
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,560
Ah Ma insists all your clothes be washed and pressed every two weeks.

738
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,720
This one.

739
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,080
Everything is exactly as I left it.

740
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,350
Looking for your cigars? I had them thrown out years ago.

741
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,176
Never could get anything past you, could I?

742
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,869
I keep telling Ah Ma to put your things away.

743
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,193
But she says this room makes her feel like you're still here.

744
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,959
Well, I got an earful when you didn't move back last year.

745
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,919
Your father and I were really looking forward to having you home.

746
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,034
He's not getting any younger.

747
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,396
With you onboard, maybe he'll take a day off once in a while.

748
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,753
I know, Mum.

749
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,355
I'm just not ready yet.

750
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,760
There's things in New York that I wanna see through.

751
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,918
Well, I'm happy I finally met Rachel.

752
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,151
She is very impressive.

753
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,513
I think so, too.

754
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,056
I thought you might be excited

755
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,359
that the first girl that I bring home is a Chinese professor.

756
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,111
Chinese American.

757
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,912
You know, bringing her home,

758
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,158
introducing her at a large family gathering,

759
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,599
some people may say...

760
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,996
When there's something to say

761
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,198
about Rachel and me, you'll be first to hear.

762
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,640
But some things I need to figure out on my own.

763
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,435
Is that an American accent I'm hearing?

764
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,676
How do I look?

765
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,356
Perfect.

766
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,353
Everyone! Everyone!

767
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,840
The tan hua plants very rarely bloom, and even then, only at night.

768
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:45,280
Their beauty is spectacular but fleeting.

769
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,071
By dawn, they'll be gone.

770
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,159
So, come. Come.

771
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,719
Oh, someone forgot to wear a bra.

772
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,637
Kitty Pong. Cousin Alistair's latest flame.

773
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,155
An actress.

774
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,120
Rumor is, she was in a porno. Two Girls, One Cup of Noodles.

775
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,990
You know, I thought I would like that more than I did.

776
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,312
- The book was much better. - Mmm-hmm.

777
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,311
Is it just me or are people, like, staring at me?

778
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,030
Oh, they're just jealous. You nabbed the crown prince.

779
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,877
Nicki is Ah Ma's favorite, in line to inherit everything.

780
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,476
No surprise there when that's the competition.

781
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,439
Oh, speaking of the grande dame...

782
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,157
There you are. I've been looking all over for you.

783
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,632
You ready to meet my grandmother?

784
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,640
Ah Ma...

785
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,155
Look, they're in full bloom.

786
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,434
It's so nice having Nick back home.

787
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,195
But he seems different.

788
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,757
When children are away from home too long,

789
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,320
they forget who they are.

790
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,632
What's up? Let's jam!

791
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,798
Rachel! So happy you're here.

792
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,314
Oh.

793
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,552
Oh, my God. Your Gap look, brilliant.

794
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,120
Thanks.

795
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,472
- She's coming with me. - Uh, hold on.

796
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,358
Kiss. 36 hours. Bye.

797
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,511
- Minty, one piece please. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

798
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,880
Not listening at all.

799
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,750
So, I'm gonna intro you to my posse.

800
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,800
We're flying to my mom's resort in Sumatra.

801
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,669
She's closed down the whole place just for us.

802
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,752
We're gonna have so much fun.

803
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,400
Come on, meet the girls. Girls, this is Rachel Chu.

804
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,516
Hi!

805
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,400
So you let Bernard Tai organize all of this?

806
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,949
Yeah.

807
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,600
Bernard.

808
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,080
Hey.

809
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,911
This is for you, asshole.

810
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,913
Tina! Tini! The twins are in the house!

811
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,719
I'm so glad you made it! How are you?

812
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,398
It's easy to make a killer entrance when you come as a matching set.

813
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,712
Hi, we haven't met. I'm Amanda Ling.

814
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,554
Hi, I'm Rachel Chu.

815
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,754
Oh, you're Nick Young's friend.

816
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,152
- Yeah. - Word gets around fast here.

817
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,393
You're a professor at NYU, right?

818
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,390
Yes. Um, what about you?

819
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,957
Oh, I'm a lawyer. General counsel to the Young Family Corporation, actually.

820
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,116
That's very impressive.

821
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,751
Mmm. Nah. Just good, old-fashioned nepotism.

822
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,669
I grew up with Nick and Colin. We're family friends.

823
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,520
It's nice to meet you, Rachel Chu.

824
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,230
Ladies, come on. We're wheels up in five.

825
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,976
Let's do this?

826
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,400
Let's go.

827
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,838
Yeah!

828
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,673
All I wanted was a weekend away with my boys.

829
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,071
And some beer. Maybe some rugby.

830
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,511
Don't worry. It's gonna be great, whatever happens.

831
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,995
Yeah.

832
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,912
Let's make some babies!

833
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,560
I don't think it will be.

834
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,675
Any asshole can plan a normal stag party.

835
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,079
Hookers, drugs, dog-fighting.

836
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,637
That's minor league shit.

837
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,116
To organize a party this massive...

838
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,793
Takes a massive asshole.

839
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,352
Takes a goddamn mastermind.

840
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,839
Where exactly is this party?

841
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,920
It's right there.

842
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,875
Bloody hell!

843
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,600
Did you just see that?

844
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,680
Oh, my God, Nick. What are you worried about?

845
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,360
You don't have to keep Rachel happy. She's just lucky to be here.

846
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,479
- Nice, Eddie. - Oh, what?

847
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,296
So we're gonna pretend like that's not the truth?

848
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,840
Are we in some kind of fairy tale story that I don't know about?

849
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,391
Did you find a shoe at midnight and jump in a pumpkin?

850
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,990
Yo, I got so much shit about marrying Fiona.

851
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,312
And her parents own the biggest shipping company in Hong Kong.

852
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,035
Hey, Araminta's adorable, but you think your dad

853
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,616
would be spending millions on this wedding

854
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,633
if her parents didn't own a billion-dollar resort chain?

855
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,713
What's Rachel bringing to the table?

856
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,436
Oh, small tits!

857
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,795
Oh!

858
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,520
Hey. It's not worth it, man. They're drunk.

859
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,591
Hey, guys, this is boring. Massage time.

860
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,276
And you, the bachelor.

861
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,269
You're gonna get one before this weekend is over.

862
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,831
Or we're gonna tie you up and shave your coo coo chara.

863
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,194
Coo coo chara!

864
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,318
Hey, come try this.

865
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,519
We have to get off this ship.

866
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,550
Welcome to paradise.

867
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,113
This is Samsara Island.

868
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,671
This weekend is about sisterhood,

869
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:32,434
and connecting with the divine in all of us.

870
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,515
So, I hope you'll all find your bliss,

871
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:42,553
starting with an all-paid shopping spree at the fashion boutique!

872
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,750
Come on! Come on!

873
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,256
Bitch, I saw this first!

874
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,616
- But you have ping pong tits! - What about your mosquito bites?

875
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,359
- No! - You know it's true!

876
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,480
One more minute! You keep what you can carry.

877
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,920
One more minute! You keep what you can carry.

878
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,038
Yeah, no one loves free stuff more than rich people.

879
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,600
Just the one dress for you?

880
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,792
I don't wanna lose an arm.

881
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,440
Ooh.

882
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,239
Well, in that case...

883
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,914
One last touch.

884
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,714
Well, isn't Nick a lucky guy.

885
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,114
Time's up! Next stop,

886
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,237
spa!

887
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,976
You're a genius. You know that, right?

888
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,120
What's a best man for?

889
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,471
Guess that pilot's license came in handy after all.

890
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,794
- Here you go, champ. - Oh, thank you, sir.

891
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,315
Mmm. I think that is the best beer I've ever had.

892
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,877
I'm gonna have to agree with you on that.

893
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,638
You know, if it wasn't for Araminta, I'd ask you to marry me.

894
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,319
Although,

895
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,320
there is a little something that might get in the way of that.

896
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,320
Mmm.

897
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,680
- No! - Yeah.

898
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,278
- Is that real? - Yes.

899
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,230
- Wow! Yes! Yes, man! Congratulations! - Yes.

900
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,359
- I know. - That is freaking amazing.

901
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,994
- I'm ready. - You're ready.

902
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,480
You're doing it!

903
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,437
Nick, I'm really happy for you, man.

904
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,680
Thanks, dude.

905
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,512
I think my masseuse just got me pregnant.

906
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,989
I can see why Nick put off coming back to Singapore.

907
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,395
What do you mean?

908
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,791
You know, he was supposed to come back last year,

909
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,080
take over the family business.

910
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,117
His parents freaked out when he didn't.

911
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:12,640
But, now that he's back, I'm sure all is forgiven.

912
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,594
But he's not back for good.

913
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,273
I mean, we're just here for a wedding.

914
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,633
Wow!

915
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,234
But?

916
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,480
No, I'm really happy for you.

917
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,637
Colin, I've known you since you were in nappies.

918
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,400
I know when there's something on your mind.

919
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,999
Well, it wasn't that long ago

920
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,197
that you were sure you were moving back home.

921
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,716
And I mean, Rachel loves her job in New York.

922
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,999
Yeah, we're gonna figure that out.

923
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,800
You're going to figure it out. Right.

924
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,630
Rachel, I get it.

925
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,719
It's hard knowing where you stand with someone like Nicholas Young.

926
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,676
He has all that pressure from his family.

927
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,238
Not just in business, but in who he's dating.

928
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,235
It's like,

929
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,552
you just never know what's quite going on in that gorgeous head of his.

930
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,758
Nick told you that we were together, right?

931
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,195
It's ancient history now.

932
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,474
Although our families, particularly his mother,

933
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,799
always wanted us to get married.

934
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,560
I guess we weren't ready then.

935
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,552
Dude, ever since primary school, you were always going to be

936
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,677
the next chairman of the Young Corporation,

937
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,717
your family's shining heir.

938
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,393
You really think your family's going to accept anything less than that?

939
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,960
I mean unless you...

940
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,637
No.

941
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,880
Are you thinking of walking out?

942
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,831
Leaving everything to bloody Alistair and Eddie?

943
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,800
I'm not walking out on anything.

944
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,194
I met a girl, I fell in love, and I want to marry her.

945
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,996
And it can't just be one thing or the other.

946
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:59,679
Uh, no, no, no. It's not that simple. You know that.

947
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,234
I really admire you.

948
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:07,396
It takes guts coming all the way over here, facing Nick's family.

949
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,995
Especially when Eleanor isn't exactly in your corner.

950
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,072
Okay, your family aside,

951
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,400
have you ever thought about what your relationship

952
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,870
with Rachel will be like if you got married?

953
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,711
I mean, okay, you're Nicholas Young. You're untouchable.

954
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:26,510
You always have been. But Rachel's not.

955
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,150
And if she becomes Mrs. Nicholas Young,

956
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,516
every day for her is going to be a struggle.

957
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:42,513
I heard she told Tini that Nick is a good catch.

958
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,832
So typical. She's not even that pretty.

959
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,515
It's like she's never heard of plastic surgery.

960
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,120
Oh, shit.

961
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,640
Sorry.

962
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,434
You sure she's ready for that?

963
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,749
Rachel?

964
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,195
- I'm so sorry. - It's okay.

965
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,437
Let's just forget about those girls.

966
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,955
Camp out here and order room service?

967
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,670
I'll call security.

968
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,760
No.

969
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,037
I'm not gonna make a scene.

970
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,431
I'm not gonna give them the satisfaction.

971
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,280
This weekend was supposed to be mani-pedis,

972
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,192
cocktails served in pineapples.

973
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,513
This definitely wasn't on the menu.

974
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,280
Why would Araminta even have friends like that?

975
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,273
They're so mean.

976
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,035
Well, you grow up your whole lives together,

977
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,440
you make excuses for people.

978
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,680
Specially the morons.

979
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,712
I mean, I know Michael didn't have to deal with

980
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,156
catty, fish-killing sociopaths.

981
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,796
How did you two get through all this?

982
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:26,959
Well, he didn't have it quite this bad, but it wasn't pretty.

983
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,236
Well, at least tell me it gets better.

984
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,879
Of course it does.

985
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:39,680
You okay?

986
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,360
Yeah.

987
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:57,840
Actually,

988
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,120
no.

989
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,280
You could talk to me.

990
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,034
Michael is having an affair.

991
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,197
I'm really sorry, Astrid.

992
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,840
- Welcome back, sir. - Cheers.

993
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,157
I thought I was here to meet your family,

994
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,597
go to your best friend's wedding, eat some good food.

995
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,479
Instead, I feel like I'm a villain in a soap opera

996
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,359
who's plotting to steal your family fortune.

997
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,114
What happened?

998
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:15,795
I mean, I met Amanda.

999
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:19,080
She told me that everyone here thinks that I'm the evil person

1000
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,595
that prevented you from moving back to Singapore last year

1001
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,840
when I didn't even know you were supposed to come home.

1002
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,359
You have every reason to be upset.

1003
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,480
I'm not done yet.

1004
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:33,109
There was also this gutted, bloody fish

1005
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:36,472
that Araminta's friends left for me in my hotel room

1006
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:41,077
on my bed next to the words, "Catch this, you gold-digging bitch."

1007
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,599
Written in big, fat serial-killer letters.

1008
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,720
Is that all that happened?

1009
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,760
I mean, please tell me that's all that happened.

1010
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,595
You know what? I don't even care about those stupid girls

1011
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,961
with their stupid little designer handbags and sunglasses.

1012
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,190
I don't care about that.

1013
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,496
I don't care that your ex-girlfriend told me all this crap.

1014
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,080
It's that you didn't tell me any of it.

1015
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,040
I screwed up.

1016
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,176
- Why? Were you trying to test me? - I really messed up, okay?

1017
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,237
- Why would you do that? - I made a mistake.

1018
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,832
When we first met, you had no idea who I was,

1019
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,151
who my family were. You didn't care!

1020
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,800
Yeah, I don't care about that stupid stuff.

1021
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:14,880
Well, exactly.

1022
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:20,434
You are so different from all of the women that I grew up with.

1023
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,351
And I love who I am around you.

1024
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,597
I don't want that to change.

1025
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,558
- And that's selfish, I know. - Mmm-hmm.

1026
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,640
I'm sorry that you had to deal with that on your own.

1027
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,794
But I'm here now.

1028
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,912
Whatever happens, we'll get through it together.

1029
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,879
Dead fish and all.

1030
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,835
All right?

1031
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,196
It was so gross.

1032
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,030
But I buried it.

1033
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,240
You dealt with it.

1034
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,550
Come here.

1035
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,456
You know what? We need to do something tonight.

1036
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,560
We need to do something that's just you and me, okay?

1037
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,159
- 100% agree. - Yes.

1038
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:13,560
But we do have to go make some dumplings first.

1039
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:15,960
Okay?

1040
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,156
And can we eat them?

1041
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,456
We can eat as many as you like.

1042
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,480
Okay, fine.

1043
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,760
This is too much.

1044
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:52,119
We're hosting a rehearsal dinner, not feeding an army.

1045
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,550
Better too many than have people say we're stingy.

1046
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,314
So, right.

1047
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,510
You put the baby in bed.

1048
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,040
You tuck, tuck, tuck. Same on the other side.

1049
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,720
You give him a kiss good night.

1050
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,400
That's so cute.

1051
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,840
- How's that? - And then you eat the baby.

1052
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,997
Then you eat the baby after he's cooked.

1053
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,896
No, you gotta make sure he's cooked.

1054
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,832
- Did your Ah Ma teach you that? - She did.

1055
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,914
I, on the other hand, was taught by Grand-Auntie Mabel.

1056
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:27,912
You put the Botox in the face, and then, you pinch, pinch, pinch.

1057
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,400
Then, voilà!

1058
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,393
Did you guys all learn when you were kids?

1059
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,074
We didn't have a choice.

1060
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,753
We taught you so you'd know

1061
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:39,317
the blood, sweat, and tears it took to raise and feed you monkeys.

1062
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,954
Not like the ang-mohs,

1063
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,953
microwaving macaroni and cheese for their own children.

1064
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,590
No wonder they put their parents in the old folks' home

1065
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:47,750
when they all grow up.

1066
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:48,840
I know!

1067
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:53,718
Ah Ma says if we don't pass traditions down like this, they'll disappear.

1068
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,392
God forbid, we lose the ancient Chinese tradition

1069
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,709
of guilting your children.

1070
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,750
It's totally worth it.

1071
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,513
Mother used to wait for me after school

1072
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,640
with a nice basket of these.

1073
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,880
Hey, I never got after-school dumplings.

1074
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,956
Well, that's because Auntie Felicity was doing after-school microdermabrasion.

1075
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,235
Auntie, this is Dolce.

1076
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,194
You speak Cantonese?

1077
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:29,954
No, I don't.

1078
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:33,034
It's just great seeing you guys all like this.

1079
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,075
When I was growing up,

1080
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,755
it was just me and my mom, which I loved.

1081
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,675
But we didn't really have a big family like this.

1082
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,070
It's really nice.

1083
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,840
Oh, that's so lovely of you to say, Rachel.

1084
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,037
We are all very lucky to have each other.

1085
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,394
That's a beautiful ring, Auntie Eleanor.

1086
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,951
I've never seen anything like it.

1087
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,115
Nick's father had it made when he proposed to me.

1088
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,991
That's very romantic. How did you guys meet?

1089
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,991
Actually, they met at Cambridge. They were both studying law together.

1090
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,680
Oh, I didn't know you were a lawyer.

1091
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,798
I wasn't. I withdrew from university when we got married.

1092
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,036
Oh.

1093
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:15,955
I chose to help my husband run a business and to raise a family.

1094
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,795
For me, it was a privilege.

1095
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,111
But for you, you may think it's old-fashioned.

1096
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,075
It's nice you appreciate this house

1097
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,720
and us being here together wrapping dumplings.

1098
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,269
But all this doesn't just happen.

1099
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,115
It's because we know to put family first,

1100
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,669
instead of chasing one's passion.

1101
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:43,836
Ah Ma...

1102
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,680
Thank you.

1103
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:47,720
Oh, Nick.

1104
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,440
Come and sit.

1105
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,915
Hmm.

1106
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,030
Mmm.

1107
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:54,637
Oh, hi. I think I'm a little lost. This house is pretty big.

1108
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,439
I'm glad I found you.

1109
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,431
I am afraid that I've been unfair.

1110
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,989
Oh, no, you know what?

1111
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,153
I'm sorry I made an assumption. I didn't mean to offend you.

1112
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,480
Not at all.

1113
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,832
You asked about my ring.

1114
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:17,031
The truth is Nick's father had it made when he wanted to propose to me

1115
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,475
because Ah Ma wouldn't give him the family ring.

1116
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,839
I wasn't her first choice.

1117
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,594
Honestly, I wasn't her second.

1118
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,554
Gosh, I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

1119
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,795
I didn't come from the right family, have the right connections.

1120
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,793
And Ah Ma thought I would not make an adequate wife to her son.

1121
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,440
But she came around, obviously.

1122
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:48,595
It took many years, and she had good reason to be concerned.

1123
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,557
Because I had no idea the work and the sacrifice it would take.

1124
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:59,393
There were many days when I wondered if I would ever measure up.

1125
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,671
But having been through it all,

1126
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,679
I know this much.

1127
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,956
You will never be enough.

1128
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,635
We should head back. I wouldn't want Nick to worry.

1129
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,676
You all right?

1130
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,440
Yeah.

1131
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,319
I know my mum can be tough at times,

1132
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:49,399
but there isn't anything she wouldn't do for me.

1133
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,993
And there is a reason why I lived with Ah Ma growing up.

1134
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,032
It's because my mother knew she wasn't the favorite.

1135
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:01,312
So she let her raise me, so I would be.

1136
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,993
You were just a kid?

1137
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:06,320
Yeah.

1138
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:12,032
But it's hard to understand from the outside.

1139
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,233
But she did what she thought was best for the family.

1140
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,358
For everyone involved.

1141
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,915
Anyway, I think I've had enough with dumplings for the rest of my life.

1142
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,390
What should we do?

1143
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,999
Sushi, movies, anything you like. Really.

1144
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,515
Wait, what?

1145
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,798
Was she like, "You will never be good enough for my son"?

1146
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,599
Or was it like, "You...

1147
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,996
"You will never be good enough for my son"?

1148
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,714
- It's like the second one. - Oh.

1149
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,872
Except for in a way that made me wanna cry and puke at the same time.

1150
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,679
Gosh, she's so badass.

1151
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,576
You know, I bet if you told her you'd leave Nick for a million dollars,

1152
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,954
she will write that check.

1153
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,350
They do that around here.

1154
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,557
And she looked at me like I was nothing.

1155
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,320
Like a $10-million check. I feel like she would do that.

1156
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,592
I don't even know what I should do.

1157
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,275
I mean, I can't even tell Nick because he worships her.

1158
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:11,110
Yeah, Chinese sons think their moms fart Chanel No. 5.

1159
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,359
What about the Ah Ma? Does she hate your face, too?

1160
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:17,080
Okay, nobody said they hated my face.

1161
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:22,150
And Ah Ma, she liked my face. She said I had a lucky nose.

1162
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,640
That's great!

1163
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,176
You know, Eleanor can hate you all day long,

1164
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,193
but you can't beat 2,000 years of Chinese filial piety.

1165
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,840
I feel like I shouldn't even go to the wedding.

1166
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:34,671
You know, it's Colin and Araminta's day. I don't wanna cause any drama there.

1167
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,838
I feel like I should just sit it out.

1168
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,515
You know? Tell Nick I had food poisoning or something.

1169
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,792
- What? - That's bullshit.

1170
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,917
- You're just scared. - No, I'm not.

1171
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,878
Okay, here's what you need to understand.

1172
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:50,960
All right?

1173
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,997
It's not about getting Eleanor to like you.

1174
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:56,039
It's about getting her to respect you, all right?

1175
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,079
Right now, she just thinks you're some undeserving,

1176
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,193
- clueless, gold-digging... - Yeah, I got it.

1177
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,352
...trashy, unrefined banana.

1178
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,796
Yellow on the outside, white on the inside.

1179
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,872
I know what a banana is.

1180
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,629
When, in reality, you're a super sophisticated, smart

1181
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,280
professor of freaking game theory.

1182
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,193
Show her that side of you, you know?

1183
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:18,956
You're right.

1184
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,516
Damn straight, I'm right. It's Peik Lin, I'm always right.

1185
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,600
Yeah, she's like trying to play a game of chicken with me.

1186
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,553
Where she's like coming at me,

1187
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,520
and thinking I'm going to swerve like a chicken.

1188
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,750
But you can't swerve.

1189
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,200
I'm not gonna swerve. Not for her.

1190
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,079
No. Chickens are bitches, dude!

1191
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,016
- And I'm not a chicken. - You're not a chicken.

1192
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:38,192
You're gonna roll up to that wedding, you're gonna be like, "Bak-bak, bitch!"

1193
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,515
Bak-bak, bitch!

1194
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,273
Chickens are bitches.

1195
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,712
Sorry, Uncle.

1196
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,315
What are you doing tonight?

1197
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,790
I was gonna go to FedEx or something.

1198
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,077
Why? Oh!

1199
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:53,119
I have been waiting to do this properly for so long.

1200
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,351
I'm thinking eyebrow triage, root crimps,

1201
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,840
maybe some eyelid tape.

1202
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,320
What do you think?

1203
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,597
All of it.

1204
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,315
And I would throw in a Korean snail face mask.

1205
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,672
Sweetie, your skin is so dry, it's hurting my face.

1206
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,315
Thank you.

1207
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,677
You know, it's about time someone stood up to Auntie Eleanor.

1208
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,400
Well, you, not me. Oh, God! She can't know I was ever here.

1209
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,480
Oh, no.

1210
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,474
Right. Well, okay, let's get to work. Cappuccinos.

1211
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,871
Pull the plum Balenciaga, the peach Chloé,

1212
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,390
the Giambattista, all the Bottegas.

1213
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,551
And that Jason Wu with the deconstructed ruffles.

1214
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,120
And a sandwich for Peik Lin.

1215
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:42,280
- Oh, okay. All right. - Oh, right.

1216
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:47,151
I'm not sure if it's working or if she looks like a clown's tampon.

1217
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,594
On a heavy day.

1218
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,838
You look like a flower.

1219
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,560
A sad, lonely flower

1220
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,313
no one wants to be around.

1221
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:02,316
I mean, it's the wedding of the century. So, of course, we're here.

1222
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,718
It's not that bad.

1223
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,176
It's holding you up.

1224
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,320
It's a hands-on dress. You know what I mean?

1225
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,709
Incoming.

1226
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,629
Okay.

1227
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,116
I love my fans.

1228
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:26,034
Taipei Tiger 2 is going to redefine the genre.

1229
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,271
- She's a star. She's a star. - TT2, honey.

1230
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:29,476
Oh!

1231
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,114
I'm blinded by the light.

1232
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,759
This is why disco died.

1233
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,156
You kind of look like a slutty Ebola virus.

1234
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:38,392
It's like a bag of Skittles. Taste the rainbow.

1235
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,672
Yes. I think we just ought to...

1236
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,878
I just think if we could tell her this is coming from you,

1237
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,816
'cause she probably doesn't want to hear it from a guy.

1238
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:47,876
Okay. Okay.

1239
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,837
Okay, remember. Optimal angles.

1240
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,760
Just right here! Just right here!

1241
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,829
Ma'am.

1242
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,677
Everyone, I've got Rachel Chu of New York.

1243
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,433
Rachel Chu of New York.

1244
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,957
Rachel, Rachel, to me.

1245
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,236
Okay, ladies, looking good.

1246
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,936
Out of the way, please. Out of the way.

1247
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,997
- So gorgeous! - Thank you.

1248
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,912
Ladies, move, please. Out of the way!

1249
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:53,115
Good, that's great. Beautiful dress.

1250
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,360
Ladies.

1251
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,520
Amanda.

1252
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,676
Mmm.

1253
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,240
You're in my way.

1254
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,676
Okay, what?

1255
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,071
Our Chinese investors are getting nervous.

1256
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:16,149
I have to fly in to Shenzhen on Monday to try and talk them down.

1257
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,998
That's Cassian's birthday.

1258
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,720
Yeah, I know.

1259
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:26,839
I hate to miss it, but this is important.

1260
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,760
You'd think your son's birthday's important.

1261
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,274
Get someone else to handle it.

1262
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:41,080
Unless there's another reason you're out of town?

1263
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,832
What are you saying?

1264
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,318
I know you're having an affair.

1265
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,357
Oh, Jesus. Astrid.

1266
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:02,434
Let's just get through the wedding and we'll deal with it after.

1267
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,552
I don't wanna make a scene.

1268
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,279
You find out I'm having an affair with another woman,

1269
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,716
and you're worried about making a scene?

1270
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,474
You'd rather I scream and carry on?

1271
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:20,520
Yes. Honestly, I wish you would.

1272
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,239
It would show you cared about more than

1273
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,313
what people thought of you and your family.

1274
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,592
Don't try and turn this on me.

1275
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,912
I'm not the one who screwed up!

1276
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,070
Of course not.

1277
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:35,673
You're always the prettiest, richest, most perfect girl in the room.

1278
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,275
While I'm just this lucky bastard who will never measure up.

1279
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:39,909
Don't say that.

1280
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,838
I know what you're thinking, Astrid.

1281
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:45,352
That's why you hide your shoes, the jewelry you buy,

1282
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,194
as if every minute of my life I'm not reminded of it.

1283
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,552
I'm just tired.

1284
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,836
I'm tired of having nothing I do matter.

1285
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,872
Including having the affair.

1286
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,798
Of course what you do matters!

1287
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:04,158
How can you say that?

1288
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,160
Is this a church or a paddy field?

1289
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,357
They spent 40 million on the wedding.

1290
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,278
Really? That's too much.

1291
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,113
We're Methodists. 20 million is our limit.

1292
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,395
I know.

1293
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,877
Princess Intan. Vicious woman.

1294
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,196
I heard she demanded a whole row to herself,

1295
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,039
so she wouldn't be bothered by anyone.

1296
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:54,589
Really?

1297
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,758
Who is that?

1298
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,200
Aunties.

1299
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:19,078
Rachel, how lovely to see you.

1300
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,232
The pleasure is all mine.

1301
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:25,195
I'm sorry, our row is full.

1302
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,718
I love it.

1303
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:43,191
Bak-bak. Okay.

1304
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,791
Princess Intan. Rachel Chu.

1305
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,350
I read your great article about microloans

1306
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,954
in the Asian Economics Journal.

1307
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:03,830
I received so much criticism about that article.

1308
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:06,959
Well, you know what? I think your critics missed the point.

1309
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:11,240
'Cause your microloans helped women, and women lift up economies.

1310
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,472
What was your name, again?

1311
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,630
Rachel Chu.

1312
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,416
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1313
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,318
Now, what brings you here?

1314
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,914
I followed a boy...

1315
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:29,790
Ah Ma is here. She never comes to these things.

1316
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:54,976
How are you feeling?

1317
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,639
- Good. - All right. Don't be nervous.

1318
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,120
- I'm not nervous. - You look great.

1319
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,475
Thank you.

1320
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,554
Hey, Rachel's not sitting with your family.

1321
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,598
Yeah. I don't blame her.

1322
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:07,195
Mother hasn't exactly been the most welcoming.

1323
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,352
But I'm sure she'll be at the back somewhere laying low.

1324
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:14,676
No. She's right at the front. Take a look.

1325
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,711
I think you've got a fighter.

1326
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,835
Guys, it's time.

1327
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,156
- Okay. - All right.

1328
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:36,800
- Hey. - Yeah?

1329
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,376
Make sure she doesn't take your balls.

1330
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,319
Just joking. Just joking.

1331
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,914
Thanks for dressing up, Bernard.

1332
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,832
Hey. It's not about me.

1333
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,520
Yeah. Come on. Thanks, Bernard.

1334
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,398
- It's not about me. - All right.

1335
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:11,596
Wise men say

1336
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:19,393
Only fools rush in

1337
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:28,236
But I can't help

1338
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:34,840
Falling in love with you

1339
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:43,479
Shall I stay?

1340
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:51,954
Would it be a sin

1341
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:58,799
If I can't help

1342
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:05,796
Falling in love with you?

1343
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:13,075
Like a river flows

1344
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:17,793
Surely to the sea

1345
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:20,913
Darling, so it goes

1346
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:27,795
Some things are meant to be

1347
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:56,150
So take my hand

1348
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:04,671
Take my whole life, too

1349
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:12,951
For I can't help

1350
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:19,992
Falling in love with you

1351
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:27,875
For I can't help

1352
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:35,873
Falling in love with you

1353
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,996
You look spectacular, you know that?

1354
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,320
It's the double Spanx. I can't breathe.

1355
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:34,076
It's not the clothes. It's just you.

1356
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,432
Uh, excuse me.

1357
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,876
This party isn't gonna dance itself. Come on.

1358
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,758
- Come on, Nicki-Nick. - All right.

1359
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:43,949
You're very good.

1360
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,456
- Yeah? I only stepped on her twice. - Very.

1361
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:07,296
Oliver.

1362
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:08,549
Yes, Auntie?

1363
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,953
Be a dear and take care of that.

1364
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,953
As you wish.

1365
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,719
You know, you should wear a tux more often.

1366
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,071
Like, all the time?

1367
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:39,273
Yeah. You know, when you're playing basketball at the Y,

1368
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,398
shaving, brushing your teeth.

1369
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,830
Alistair, your father's looking for you.

1370
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,799
Something about an overdrawn discretionary account.

1371
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,080
Oh, my God.

1372
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,313
Baby! Oh, my gosh!

1373
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,109
Oh. Hi.

1374
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,431
So, how do you like the wedding?

1375
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:11,230
Oh, my gosh! It's so glamorous!

1376
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:15,952
When it's Alistair's and my wedding, I want it just like this.

1377
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:20,114
No, no, no! I want it big! Big! Better!

1378
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:24,116
Sweetie! You'll be lucky if Alistair's parents

1379
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,271
give you a tea ceremony.

1380
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:30,230
You know Alistair's only the fourth son of a penny-pinching family, don't you?

1381
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:33,199
I mean, he'll get next to nothing. You want a wedding like this?

1382
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,431
You should've fallen in love with an only child.

1383
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,595
Someone like

1384
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:40,834
Bernard Tai.

1385
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,033
Master Nicholas,

1386
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,957
your grandmother would like to speak to you and Miss Rachel.

1387
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,159
Okay.

1388
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:56,995
Sick party.

1389
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,355
Yeah!

1390
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,200
Hold that.

1391
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,319
Ah Ma, Mum, what's all this about?

1392
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:32,600
Ah Ma!

1393
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:33,976
I'm sorry to tell you, but Rachel

1394
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,071
has been lying to us about her family

1395
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,435
and her mother.

1396
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,716
What are you talking about?

1397
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,359
I hired a private investigator...

1398
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,176
- Mom, you didn't. - ...to look into her past.

1399
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:43,416
She said her father passed away in China...

1400
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:44,440
Mum!

1401
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:45,749
...but that's not true.

1402
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,390
Your mother's husband is very much alive.

1403
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,752
During her marriage, she cheated on him

1404
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,832
and became pregnant with another man's child.

1405
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,555
And before he found out, she ran away to America.

1406
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:57,376
- It's all in here. - You had no right!

1407
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,896
- We had every right! - You did not!

1408
01:32:58,920 --> 01:32:59,956
You're lying!

1409
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:02,316
Do you have any idea the scandal this would have caused

1410
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,232
for Rachel to hide something like this?

1411
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,189
She wouldn't have.

1412
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:12,238
We cannot be linked to this sort of family.

1413
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:19,153
I don't want any part of your family.

1414
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:20,560
Rachel...

1415
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,576
Let me go! Rachel.

1416
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,720
Nick!

1417
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,656
Hey, Cinderella. What's wrong?

1418
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:50,760
You gotta return your dress before midnight?

1419
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:56,157
- Nicki-Nick! - Oh, you're just in time.

1420
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:09,590
Oliver.

1421
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:11,720
- Nicki, have you... - Rachel. Have you seen Rachel?

1422
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,995
- Nicholas! Hi! It's been so long. - Yes.

1423
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,796
Amanda, no. Amanda, not now!

1424
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:09,671
Rachel. Come to breakfast.

1425
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,033
You need to eat.

1426
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:18,840
Or use the bathroom, or maybe a shower.

1427
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,354
It's there if you need it.

1428
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,712
Here, Rachel. This is your dinner.

1429
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,440
Thank you.

1430
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,319
I'll stop by again tonight.

1431
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:19,634
Rachel, please, just give me a call.

1432
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:24,400
Anytime. Please.

1433
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:39,119
Rachel, someone's here to see ya.

1434
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:41,597
I don't want to see him.

1435
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:42,680
It's not Nick.

1436
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:47,960
Mom!

1437
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:02,159
Drink more.

1438
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:06,637
The dong-quai and the ginseng will give you more energy.

1439
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:10,309
Thanks.

1440
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:16,230
Your spirit has always been so strong, ever since young.

1441
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,432
You will get through this.

1442
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:25,273
Why didn't you tell me about my father?

1443
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:38,397
My husband wasn't a good man.

1444
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:42,309
He hurt me.

1445
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:49,469
But an old schoolmate of mine helped me through things,

1446
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,392
and we fell in love,

1447
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:56,475
and I got pregnant with his baby.

1448
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:58,716
That's you.

1449
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:03,990
I was so afraid my husband would find out and kill us both,

1450
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:07,198
so I just took you and I ran to America.

1451
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,478
Did you ever,

1452
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:16,079
I don't know, think about trying to talk to him?

1453
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:17,520
I mean, do you think about him?

1454
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:20,796
Every day.

1455
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:24,273
When we first came to America,

1456
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,950
all I could think about was reaching out for him,

1457
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:30,477
but I was so afraid my husband would find us.

1458
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:34,032
And now, I just don't want to cause any trouble.

1459
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:40,794
I'm really sorry.

1460
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:44,556
Oh, don't be sorry.

1461
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:48,869
You listen to me.

1462
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:54,633
Everything that happened in my past life is the reason why I got you.

1463
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,797
My brave and clever girl.

1464
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:16,638
I really thought he was the one.

1465
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,511
Now, I just want to go home.

1466
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:28,600
You know, Nick was the one who called me and brought me out here.

1467
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:35,354
Before we go, I think you should go and talk to him.

1468
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:49,953
I'll e-mail the photo later.

1469
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,199
P.T., how long you been standing there?

1470
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:53,800
Just a short while.

1471
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:34,919
I'm so sorry about everything.

1472
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,071
What my mother did to you is unforgivable.

1473
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,033
- It's not your fault. - It is.

1474
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,835
Ever since I can remember, my family has been my whole life.

1475
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,789
And I am done making excuses for them.

1476
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,356
Nick.

1477
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:00,640
Marry me.

1478
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:03,870
Marry me, and we'll start a new life together in New York.

1479
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:06,634
Just you and me. I'll leave all of this behind.

1480
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,519
Thanks for meeting me here.

1481
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,675
Don't worry about them.

1482
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:27,952
They're half deaf and they only speak Hokkien.

1483
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:31,109
Mmm.

1484
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:57,840
My mom taught me how to play.

1485
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:02,120
She told me Mahjong would teach me important life skills.

1486
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:06,670
Negotiation, strategy, cooperation.

1487
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:12,594
You asked me here. I assume it's not for a Mahjong lesson.

1488
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,354
My mother taught me, too.

1489
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:30,239
I know Nick told you the truth about my mom.

1490
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,037
But you didn't like me the second I got here.

1491
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:35,556
Why is that?

1492
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:37,799
There is a Hokkien phrase.

1493
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:41,191
It means, "Our own kind of people."

1494
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:44,997
And you're not our own kind.

1495
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:46,800
'Cause I'm not rich?

1496
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,157
'Cause I didn't go to a British boarding school

1497
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:52,550
or I wasn't born into a wealthy family?

1498
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:54,911
You're a foreigner. American.

1499
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:58,637
And all Americans think about is their own happiness.

1500
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:00,880
Don't you want Nick to be happy?

1501
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,272
It's an illusion.

1502
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,992
We understand how to build things that last.

1503
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:08,919
Something you know nothing about.

1504
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:13,360
You don't know me.

1505
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,116
I know you're not what Nick needs.

1506
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,873
Well, he proposed to me yesterday.

1507
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:32,236
He said he'd walk away from his family and from you for good.

1508
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:38,199
Don't worry. I turned him down.

1509
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:44,873
Only a fool folds a winning hand.

1510
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:48,920
There's no winning. You made sure of that.

1511
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:53,233
Because if Nick chose me, he would lose his family.

1512
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,071
And if he chose his family,

1513
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:01,153
he might spend the rest of his life resenting you.

1514
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:23,439
So you chose for him.

1515
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,678
I'm not leaving 'cause I'm scared

1516
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:29,237
or because I think I'm not enough.

1517
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,074
Because maybe for the first time in my life,

1518
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:36,640
I know I am.

1519
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:41,598
I just love Nick so much.

1520
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:44,195
I don't want him to lose his mom again.

1521
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:54,160
So I just wanted you to know that one day,

1522
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:58,632
when he marries another lucky girl, who is enough for you,

1523
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:04,590
and you're playing with your grandkids while the tan huas are blooming

1524
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:06,876
or the birds are chirping,

1525
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,631
that it was because of me.

1526
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:15,880
A poor, raised by a single mother,

1527
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:21,599
low class, immigrant nobody.

1528
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:00,356
Hey.

1529
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:03,516
I'm gonna send someone for the rest of my stuff.

1530
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:06,296
But I wanna talk to you about my visitation rights with Cassian.

1531
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:07,356
Stop talking.

1532
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:09,116
What?

1533
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:11,313
Don't worry about packing your things.

1534
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:15,037
You bought this apartment, you keep it. We're leaving.

1535
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,909
What do you mean you're leaving? Where are you gonna go?

1536
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:22,678
I have 14 apartment buildings that I own, so probably one of those.

1537
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:27,200
And you'll see Cassian when it's good for him, not when it's good for you.

1538
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:30,670
Hey!

1539
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,834
Look, you know, it's not just my fault that things didn't work out.

1540
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:38,836
You're right. I shouldn't have kept things from you.

1541
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:41,875
Hidden my shoes, turned down jobs,

1542
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:45,032
charity work, worrying that it might make you feel lesser than.

1543
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,080
But let's be clear.

1544
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:50,440
The problem with our marriage isn't my family's money.

1545
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,476
It's that you're a coward. You gave up on us.

1546
01:47:55,880 --> 01:48:00,238
But I've just realized, it's not my job to make you feel like a man.

1547
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,239
I can't make you something you're not.

1548
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,119
Good for you!

1549
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:18,272
Walking away from Nick and his family's fat-ass property portfolio.

1550
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:21,400
You have no one, no net worth,

1551
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:24,399
but you have integrity.

1552
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,519
That's why I respect you.

1553
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:29,232
Thank you for everything.

1554
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:07,398
- Bye, Mrs. Chu. - Goodbye and thank you.

1555
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:11,239
Sure I can't get you to stay?

1556
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:14,040
You know, my brother P.T., he's still single.

1557
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,080
All right.

1558
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:08,914
Rachel!

1559
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:13,478
Rachel! Stay there.

1560
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:18,032
I'm gonna go and look for some extra blankets.

1561
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:21,000
Hello.

1562
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:25,076
Sorry, just one second. Nick, what are you doing here?

1563
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,874
I'm flying back to New York with you.

1564
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,756
God, don't make this harder than it already is.

1565
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:33,592
I always imagined what me proposing to you would be like.

1566
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:36,520
You know what? I had it all planned out.

1567
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:37,875
Oh!

1568
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:39,599
I'm right behind you. Don't mind me.

1569
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,312
I'd bring you to my favorite spot on the island.

1570
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,469
There's a hidden trail that I used to go to as a child.

1571
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:49,395
Now, there's a cove there that opens up to this beautiful lake.

1572
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:52,431
Um, sorry, dude. Give me a second.

1573
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:59,157
When the sun hits the horizon, I'd get down on one knee.

1574
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:03,440
And the rest of the world would fall away.

1575
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:04,874
Because it would just be you...

1576
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:06,549
And...

1577
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:09,639
Because it's just you... Sorry, I can help you with that.

1578
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:11,154
All right, it's fine. Stay there.

1579
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:13,917
Yay. You, too? Watch your fingers.

1580
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:15,959
- Lift it up. Okay. - Thank you.

1581
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,036
Everybody okay?

1582
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:21,230
Because I just need 30 seconds with this woman.

1583
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:22,630
Okay, thank you.

1584
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:24,429
Oh. Coming through. Sorry.

1585
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:28,594
I know this is a far throw from a hidden paradise.

1586
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:34,435
But wherever you are in the world, that's where I belong.

1587
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:37,676
But I...

1588
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,793
Rachel Chu,

1589
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:47,920
will you marry me?

1590
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:52,991
And make me the happiest man in this world?

1591
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:56,114
Yes! Yes! Yes! She will marry you!

1592
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:58,276
Yes!

1593
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,798
Oh!

1594
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,437
- I love you. - I love you, too.

1595
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:19,119
This is gonna be some flight back to New York.

1596
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:23,191
I was actually thinking about staying one more night.

1597
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:37,912
It's all about you, Nick!

1598
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:24,114
Make babies! Make babies!

1599
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:32,520
English - SDH
