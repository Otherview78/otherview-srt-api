1
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:51,612
- Keep this sucker steady, Toll!
- I'm doing my best!

2
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,203
Here we go!

3
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:08,337
Come on, you bastards!

4
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,026
Eat shit!

5
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,747
- Better duck!
- Oh, shit.

6
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,298
Yeah!

7
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:02,683
Cover up!

8
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:16,030
Break!

9
00:04:27,793 --> 00:04:29,794
- Watch your head, Insect!
- Shut up, Gunner!

10
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:35,716
Gotta love it!

11
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,904
Incoming chopper!

12
00:04:58,782 --> 00:05:00,533
We gotta get this thing out of here!

13
00:05:00,617 --> 00:05:01,868
You got any ideas?

14
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:05,204
- That's what I'm asking you!
- Well, I'm asking you.

15
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,420
Clear!

16
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,984
I got this.

17
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:37,987
Yeah!

18
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:37,588
Toll Road, get him up.

19
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:46,430
Trench?

20
00:06:46,515 --> 00:06:48,099
This is embarrassing.

21
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:49,308
Yeah, it sure is.

22
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:51,352
What's he doing here?

23
00:06:51,436 --> 00:06:53,396
Saving this Chinese billionaire.

24
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,440
Oh, yeah? That's funny. So are we.

25
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:59,068
Well, then we have a scheduling problem,
don't we?

26
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:01,612
Cut me loose, Frankenstein.

27
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:02,822
Don't get nuts, Gunner.

28
00:07:03,448 --> 00:07:04,824
Do it.

29
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:08,577
- Where's your team?
- Waiting.

30
00:07:08,954 --> 00:07:11,455
I need a weapon. Something big.

31
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,874
- Yours.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,366
My big weapon's hangin' right where it is.

33
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:18,566
Come on, Caesar. You got a backup.

34
00:07:20,444 --> 00:07:23,487
If I don't get this back,
your ass is terminated.

35
00:07:23,572 --> 00:07:24,905
In your dreams.

36
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,867
- Trench, we got a way out.
- Thanks. I got my own.

37
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:29,201
Let's get you out of here, paI.

38
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:32,913
Hey, look. I hate to break up the bromance.
We're 20 seconds late!

39
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:35,583
Get Moneybags up.

40
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:36,959
A "thank you" would be nice.

41
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:39,920
- I hate owing you.
- Well, you do, big boy.

42
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:47,011
Let's go, Yao.

43
00:07:47,095 --> 00:07:49,096
- Did you win?
- Of course I win.

44
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:51,932
Let's go!

45
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:02,735
I'm out!

46
00:08:05,363 --> 00:08:06,614
Now you put on your lucky ring?

47
00:08:12,162 --> 00:08:13,662
One wet wall coming up.

48
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:38,437
I got your gang bang right here!

49
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:48,322
What?

50
00:09:01,753 --> 00:09:03,420
I got your back!

51
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:06,507
Keep movin'!

52
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:10,344
Here we go!

53
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:13,514
- Why always me?
- Are you hit?

54
00:09:13,598 --> 00:09:15,349
Yeah, twice.

55
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:18,060
- Better you than me.
- That's nice. Nice.

56
00:09:23,358 --> 00:09:26,569
- You order room service?
- Not really.

57
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,070
This is gonna be a piss-poor ending.

58
00:09:35,036 --> 00:09:36,287
That loaded?

59
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:37,788
We can only hope.

60
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:49,049
Sorry, sir. I had to adjust for a wind shift.

61
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:51,051
No problem. Hit the last position.

62
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:52,761
Moving out. Over.

63
00:09:54,764 --> 00:09:56,307
Let's go, go, go!

64
00:10:00,437 --> 00:10:01,437
Yeah!

65
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:20,414
Let's go! Come on!

66
00:10:41,686 --> 00:10:43,103
Okay, hold on, ladies.

67
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:44,563
Cavalry's here.

68
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:46,065
It's about time you got here!

69
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:49,109
- Wake up Santa.
- On it.

70
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,582
Shit!

71
00:11:21,142 --> 00:11:23,435
The guy is good. You're good.

72
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,812
Appreciate it, sir.

73
00:11:26,856 --> 00:11:29,066
We'll swing around and pick you up, kid.

74
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,693
I won't be late, sir.

75
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:52,589
Go!

76
00:12:00,015 --> 00:12:01,765
All right, guys. Put your toys away.

77
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,036
Target in sight.

78
00:12:24,873 --> 00:12:26,331
- Soup's hot!
- Fire!

79
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:32,588
- You missed.
- You're aiming!

80
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:36,526
Fire!

81
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:51,315
Yeah!

82
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:02,159
That was a statement. Hit it!

83
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:13,587
- Drop the skis!
- Come on, get rid of this weight.

84
00:13:19,636 --> 00:13:20,719
Climb, baby.

85
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:32,564
Climb, baby!

86
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:41,198
Climb!

87
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:49,623
It ain't gettin' up!

88
00:14:01,636 --> 00:14:04,638
Lucky ring.

89
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:20,863
We are approximately
20 miles out of Beijing.

90
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:22,656
Not that I wanna hear it,
what's the oil pressure?

91
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,325
- Faulty.
- Great. And the altimeter?

92
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,077
Would you believe?
It's stuck on 10,000 feet.

93
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:29,580
- Hydraulics?
- What hydraulics?

94
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:32,374
Congratulations.
You own another piece of junk now.

95
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,252
- Hey, can we talk when you're not too busy?
- Sure, anytime.

96
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:36,503
Kid's amazing.

97
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:39,673
Really. So am I. You're just used to me.

98
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:42,426
Get the client ready.

99
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,471
What is going on?

100
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:49,308
Looks like you're taking
a shortcut home, paI.

101
00:14:51,227 --> 00:14:52,603
Parachute good?

102
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:55,063
Parachute? Why you got a parachute?

103
00:14:55,481 --> 00:14:58,525
Can you believe they changed
our landing permit until tomorrow?

104
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,652
Yeah, but it's okay.
He'll get home a little earlier.

105
00:15:00,737 --> 00:15:02,196
Fifteen seconds.

106
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,614
Opening the hatch!

107
00:15:04,657 --> 00:15:06,658
Yang, get Moneybags home safely.

108
00:15:06,743 --> 00:15:08,202
So when are you coming back?

109
00:15:08,286 --> 00:15:11,955
Maybe soon, maybe never.
Maybe try a new life.

110
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,541
Then who am I supposed to pick on?

111
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:16,293
You will find another minority.

112
00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:17,711
Yang.

113
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:19,838
Smile.

114
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:25,469
See you later, alligator.

115
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:33,769
That's real Chinese takeout.

116
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:39,983
Floor it. I'm homesick.

117
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:41,401
You got it.

118
00:15:58,086 --> 00:15:59,503
Yes! I love this song!

119
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:04,091
Juliet. Two.

120
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:06,593
Christmas, my friend.

121
00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:08,845
Please tell me you ain't
going through with this.

122
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,889
Of course I am. Look at that girl.

123
00:16:10,974 --> 00:16:12,599
Who wouldn't marry her?

124
00:16:12,684 --> 00:16:14,434
She cheated on you.

125
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:15,978
- It was a half-cheat.
- Which is?

126
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:18,063
The other side of a half-truth.

127
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:20,023
- The facts are murky.
- Murky.

128
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:21,900
I hate to break this to you, paI,

129
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:25,612
but your girlfriend over there
has a world-class cheating gene.

130
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,826
- I should stab you in the heart.
- Too late.

131
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:33,370
Hi, cheers.

132
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:36,623
You know, I used to think
you had a black heart.

133
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,500
Black is too colorful.

134
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:39,876
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

135
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:43,547
- Hey, Barney.
- Hey, Lacy.

136
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:47,509
Promise next time not to keep
my baby away so long?

137
00:16:47,593 --> 00:16:49,052
Cross my heart.

138
00:16:50,722 --> 00:16:51,888
If he had one.

139
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,643
Look who's lost in space.

140
00:16:57,437 --> 00:16:58,478
Got a pen?

141
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:05,235
Hey.

142
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,654
You got anything
that doesn't have skulls on it?

143
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:09,740
Matter of fact, I don't.

144
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:27,132
Einstein's theory of special relativity.

145
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:28,508
Only I made it better.

146
00:17:33,306 --> 00:17:36,516
Believe it or not, before Gunner
became chemically unbalanced,

147
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:40,187
he went to MIT, had a Master's degree
in chemical engineering.

148
00:17:40,271 --> 00:17:42,230
This idiot actually had a brain,
you believe that?

149
00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:43,273
Well, what happened?

150
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:44,524
He quit to be a bouncer.

151
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:47,778
I wanted to get close to this girl
who danced at this disco.

152
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:50,280
Yeah, I can't believe she dumped you.

153
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:52,407
- Wouldn't you?
- I would, yeah.

154
00:17:57,705 --> 00:18:00,540
- Can we talk outside?
- Yeah, sure. Let's go.

155
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:10,717
How do I put this?

156
00:18:10,802 --> 00:18:12,928
Just be straight up. Honest.

157
00:18:14,055 --> 00:18:15,555
I feel...

158
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,351
I'm not sure what I feel.

159
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:24,439
This life, it's not for you, is it?

160
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:27,984
I thought it was.

161
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:30,737
You gave me a chance to be one of you,
and you've got my respect forever.

162
00:18:31,114 --> 00:18:33,407
And you've got my respect, too.

163
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,535
What are you gonna do?

164
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,870
Well, I'd like to finish out the month.

165
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,456
Then I wanna go meet up with my girlfriend.

166
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,916
Where's she from?

167
00:18:43,543 --> 00:18:45,085
She's French.

168
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:48,672
Believe it or not, I met her in Afghanistan.
She was a nurse.

169
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:51,508
That comes in handy.

170
00:18:51,592 --> 00:18:53,760
Yeah. And you'd like her.

171
00:18:55,972 --> 00:18:58,765
You know, she's the kind of person
you wanna do things for.

172
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,518
That's why I took this job,
'cause the money's great.

173
00:19:01,978 --> 00:19:05,188
Now I can afford to get her
everything she deserves.

174
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:08,191
It's one of those things that just feels right.

175
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:12,571
You know when you can be with someone
and you don't even have to talk.

176
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:16,241
You already know what they're thinking.
You ever had that?

177
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,410
Sure.

178
00:19:21,664 --> 00:19:23,415
I don't want you to think that
I'm deserting you.

179
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:28,044
No, listen.
If I had to do it all over again at your age,

180
00:19:29,088 --> 00:19:31,423
I'd be doing what you're doing.

181
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:34,926
Why don't you freshen up that beer?

182
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:37,179
All right.

183
00:20:27,522 --> 00:20:29,606
Barney Ross.

184
00:20:37,448 --> 00:20:39,616
What do you want from me, Church?

185
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,702
Not too good in the memory category,
are you, Barney?

186
00:20:45,122 --> 00:20:48,375
You made a deal with me.
You gave me your word.

187
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:52,254
And you end up blowing up half of Vilena,

188
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:55,465
punching holes and a bowie knife
through a fellow CIA agent,

189
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,175
even if he was a dirtbag.

190
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,636
But what breaks my heart

191
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,056
is that you stole $5 million from me.

192
00:21:05,518 --> 00:21:07,477
And for all this male pattern badness,

193
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:11,731
I could've put you in the deepest,
darkest hole in Gitmo.

194
00:21:13,568 --> 00:21:15,277
No sunlight.

195
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:17,737
- But I kept you out.
- Great.

196
00:21:17,822 --> 00:21:21,741
Because I knew the day would come
when you were gonna pay me back.

197
00:21:22,743 --> 00:21:24,494
Today is that day.

198
00:21:24,996 --> 00:21:26,788
Keep talking.

199
00:21:27,498 --> 00:21:29,374
A Chinese plane got shot down
over the mountains

200
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,334
near a hell-hole called Gasak.

201
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:32,919
Yeah? Who shot it down?

202
00:21:33,004 --> 00:21:34,588
Take a guess.

203
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:40,510
Onboard that plane is a safe carrying
something you don't need to know about.

204
00:21:40,595 --> 00:21:43,972
All you need to know is
you can't let it fall into the wrong hands.

205
00:21:44,056 --> 00:21:45,056
Now, you're gonna go in there,

206
00:21:45,141 --> 00:21:47,517
and you're gonna get the contents
of that safe before anyone else.

207
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:48,685
You're gonna bring it to me.

208
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:51,062
It should be a walk in the park for you.

209
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:52,606
And then we're even.

210
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:54,608
We'll get to that.

211
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,944
The safe in that plane is very high-tech.

212
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:00,822
The access code changes
every 120 seconds.

213
00:22:00,906 --> 00:22:03,199
You use the wrong code, it blows.

214
00:22:03,284 --> 00:22:05,201
- So we need to get you in...
- Wait, wait.

215
00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:06,870
"We. " Who's we?
Who are you working with?

216
00:22:06,954 --> 00:22:08,830
That's none of your business.

217
00:22:08,914 --> 00:22:10,957
Let's just call our host The Corporation.

218
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:14,419
All right? I'm sending along a pro

219
00:22:14,503 --> 00:22:17,797
who specializes in this type of situation.
Her name is Maggie Chang.

220
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:18,923
A woman.

221
00:22:19,008 --> 00:22:21,217
That usually goes along
with the name Maggie, yeah.

222
00:22:21,302 --> 00:22:22,469
Forget it.

223
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,888
She can handle herself.

224
00:22:24,972 --> 00:22:26,806
But let me be clear.

225
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:30,435
If anything happens to her,
she gets a hangnail,

226
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:32,145
she gets hurt, she gets roughed up,

227
00:22:32,229 --> 00:22:36,775
she doesn't come back in exactly
the same condition she went in,

228
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:40,945
you and your little gang of psychotic mutts
will never be seen again.

229
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,532
And that, I promise you.

230
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,911
I don't make a very good babysitter.

231
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,958
Don't sell yourself short.

232
00:23:02,176 --> 00:23:04,969
You're gonna make a very good babysitter.

233
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,014
Be there at 7:00.

234
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:51,099
Hey. I'm Maggie Chang.

235
00:23:51,183 --> 00:23:53,560
- You're Barney Ross?
- Yeah.

236
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:55,562
Mr. Church told you about me?

237
00:23:56,021 --> 00:23:57,480
Said you wanna tag along?

238
00:23:57,565 --> 00:23:59,691
Help, not tag along.

239
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:02,068
Nice motorcycle.

240
00:24:03,946 --> 00:24:06,156
Where we're going is new.
We don't know what to expect.

241
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,866
Is it custom?

242
00:24:10,411 --> 00:24:12,662
I think it's a mistake, you coming along.

243
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:14,956
Build it yourself?

244
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:19,335
Yeah, I built it myself.
Are you playing games with me, Maggie?

245
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:23,631
No. Are you playing games with me?

246
00:24:24,258 --> 00:24:25,884
Church told me what you said.

247
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:29,304
I'm combat proficient.
I don't need a babysitter.

248
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,434
So, when do we leave?

249
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,436
0500.

250
00:24:37,855 --> 00:24:39,481
Nice meeting you.

251
00:25:20,815 --> 00:25:22,398
She's into me.

252
00:25:22,483 --> 00:25:24,025
She hates you.

253
00:25:25,402 --> 00:25:26,694
Watch this.

254
00:25:57,476 --> 00:26:00,895
You know, if something happens to her,
it's coming back on us.

255
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,730
Did you ever think to ask me
for my opinion?

256
00:26:02,815 --> 00:26:07,068
I told you 10 times before, I didn't have a
choice, unless you don't mind going to jail.

257
00:26:07,152 --> 00:26:08,611
Yeah, well, Church intimidated you.

258
00:26:08,696 --> 00:26:10,238
- Really?
- Yeah.

259
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:13,658
Is that the woman
you can never fully trust calling again?

260
00:26:13,742 --> 00:26:16,077
You know, I will stab you one day.

261
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:18,872
Hey, baby.

262
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,499
Yeah, of course I'm thinking about you.

263
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:24,836
What else is there to think about?

264
00:26:26,922 --> 00:26:28,089
Hopeless.

265
00:26:34,638 --> 00:26:35,638
Hey.

266
00:26:36,765 --> 00:26:38,933
You were in the Army, right?

267
00:26:39,018 --> 00:26:40,143
I can tell.

268
00:26:41,103 --> 00:26:43,730
Yes, ma'am. Three years.

269
00:26:43,814 --> 00:26:45,732
Last tour was Afghanistan, Kunar Province.

270
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:48,443
Didn't like it anymore?

271
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,154
Long story.

272
00:26:51,238 --> 00:26:54,574
- I would like to hear it.
- All right.

273
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,537
I was trained as a sniper,
and an instructor, too,

274
00:26:59,622 --> 00:27:03,291
but I actually wanted to mix it up,
get in on the action.

275
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:07,420
This one time, we're stuck out
in this hell-hole valley.

276
00:27:08,047 --> 00:27:12,175
About 30 Taliban opened up
from these houses in the hills above us.

277
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:14,344
And they got about eight of us
pinned down bad.

278
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:18,306
So I called in for artillery support.
But, "No way," says the captain.

279
00:27:18,682 --> 00:27:20,683
Didn't wanna endanger the locals.

280
00:27:20,768 --> 00:27:26,356
So we scattered. Some crawled to a ditch,
some to the dry riverbed and the rest bailed.

281
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,274
But we were still stuck in the kill zone.

282
00:27:29,568 --> 00:27:33,279
And we battled for,
I don't know, three hours.

283
00:27:35,282 --> 00:27:38,910
And finally, an Apache gunship chopper
showed up to provide air cover.

284
00:27:38,994 --> 00:27:40,828
Scattered the Hadjis, but...

285
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:48,252
Smoke clears and four of my squad are dead
in the ditch and two in the riverbed.

286
00:27:55,302 --> 00:27:59,847
Yeah, I was mad and sick,
all dead for nothin'.

287
00:28:04,103 --> 00:28:07,271
You know the most screwed up thing of all

288
00:28:08,315 --> 00:28:09,649
is when I got back to base that night,

289
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:14,153
I found out that they had shot
this stray dog that I adopted.

290
00:28:15,155 --> 00:28:18,324
Commander's orders to get rid
of all animals on the base.

291
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,996
I mean, you'd think we had enough damn
shooting for one day, you know?

292
00:28:27,418 --> 00:28:30,378
And, anyway,
I figured it was time to move on.

293
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:35,008
I heard these guys were looking
for someone, and here I am.

294
00:28:51,734 --> 00:28:52,984
You got that transponder?

295
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:56,946
- Yes. Apparently, 15 kilometers northwest.
- Okay.

296
00:29:10,252 --> 00:29:11,878
Hello, darlin'.

297
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:15,131
Hello, darlin'. I'm a little busy. Can I...

298
00:29:15,215 --> 00:29:17,050
Let's move. We're in and out of here fast.

299
00:29:17,134 --> 00:29:18,217
The sooner, the better.

300
00:29:18,302 --> 00:29:20,511
- Billy the Kid.
- Yeah?

301
00:29:20,596 --> 00:29:23,389
Today's your lucky day.
You get to take point.

302
00:29:23,766 --> 00:29:25,683
My pleasure, sir.

303
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,567
Impressive.

304
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:38,571
Hold on.

305
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:43,618
Remember when you could do that?

306
00:29:43,702 --> 00:29:45,078
No, do you?

307
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:46,746
I could blow him away if I needed to.

308
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,790
Really? Look down.

309
00:29:51,043 --> 00:29:52,835
Look down. You see what I see?

310
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,170
Short legs.

311
00:29:54,254 --> 00:29:57,507
1,000 bucks you can't catch him.
Go on, Flash.

312
00:29:58,759 --> 00:29:59,967
I'm a little busy.

313
00:30:00,052 --> 00:30:01,385
Are you?

314
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:20,613
Found the wreck
at the bottom of the hill, sir.

315
00:30:21,323 --> 00:30:23,533
Slow it down, Billy.
You're making us look bad.

316
00:30:23,617 --> 00:30:26,077
- Say it again, over?
- You heard.

317
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:30,957
- Roger that. Slowing it down.
- We appreciate it.

318
00:30:39,967 --> 00:30:42,051
Rest of the plane's over the hill, sir.

319
00:30:42,136 --> 00:30:43,761
Good work, Billy.

320
00:30:53,522 --> 00:30:56,357
Looks like somebody had a bad day.

321
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:00,653
You guys go to the right.

322
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:09,287
Take off, Rover.

323
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:15,360
All right, Billy.
You get a vantage point up there.

324
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,000
There's fur in their hands.

325
00:31:22,502 --> 00:31:24,962
These guys were alive
until the wolves got to them.

326
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:26,839
Be careful.

327
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:48,360
Is this it?

328
00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:53,782
Yes, it's here.

329
00:31:55,785 --> 00:31:57,870
Caesar! I need you in here.

330
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:06,253
Caesar, grab a hold of this thing.
I think it's spring-loaded.

331
00:32:06,337 --> 00:32:07,838
Lee, hook it on.

332
00:32:08,214 --> 00:32:10,174
Now, on the count of three,
let's pull it back.

333
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,884
Ready?

334
00:32:14,304 --> 00:32:16,722
One, two, three.

335
00:32:22,228 --> 00:32:24,646
- We can't hold this.
- You have to.

336
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,242
Come on, Maggie!

337
00:32:39,454 --> 00:32:41,663
- Something's wrong.
- What?

338
00:32:41,748 --> 00:32:42,998
The explosive timer's triggered.

339
00:32:43,082 --> 00:32:44,666
- How long?
- Fifty-four seconds!

340
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:46,043
If we leave now, we'll make it.

341
00:32:46,127 --> 00:32:48,337
- Maggie, let it go!
- No, I can do it!

342
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,882
Come on, Maggie!

343
00:32:51,966 --> 00:32:52,966
Maggie, what's going on?

344
00:32:54,093 --> 00:32:55,803
She tripped the detonator. Stay back!

345
00:33:02,101 --> 00:33:03,852
I'm losing my grip!

346
00:33:05,772 --> 00:33:07,731
You do, she's cut in half.

347
00:33:11,778 --> 00:33:13,278
- Come on, Maggie!
- Got it!

348
00:33:18,535 --> 00:33:20,452
Yeah, lucky I was here.

349
00:33:20,537 --> 00:33:21,703
Just thinking that.

350
00:33:21,788 --> 00:33:24,581
I'm sorry. It's important I get this.

351
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:27,251
You've got guts. No common sense.

352
00:33:27,335 --> 00:33:29,545
But guts. Come on.

353
00:33:30,129 --> 00:33:32,464
It's all right. We got it. Let's go.

354
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:34,216
You're strong.

355
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:37,636
Billy, come on down. We're out of here.

356
00:33:38,555 --> 00:33:39,680
What happened?

357
00:33:39,764 --> 00:33:42,516
That woman is crazy, but I got a good pump.

358
00:33:49,315 --> 00:33:51,358
Aren't you curious
about what's inside the case?

359
00:33:51,442 --> 00:33:53,902
No, I just wanna get Church off our back.

360
00:33:53,987 --> 00:33:55,571
Billy the Kid!

361
00:33:56,072 --> 00:33:58,240
Where the hell is he? Billy!

362
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:04,746
Drop your weapons!

363
00:34:05,206 --> 00:34:06,206
No way.

364
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:08,333
It ain't happening.

365
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:10,669
No?

366
00:34:14,007 --> 00:34:15,257
Are you sure?

367
00:34:22,223 --> 00:34:24,600
I'm sorry, sir. They were waitin'.

368
00:34:24,684 --> 00:34:26,935
- Drop the weapons now.
- Don't do it.

369
00:34:31,774 --> 00:34:33,609
He's a strong soldier.

370
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,111
Let's see how strong he is.

371
00:34:37,572 --> 00:34:38,697
Do it.

372
00:34:44,871 --> 00:34:46,121
No!

373
00:34:55,465 --> 00:34:57,549
Don't do nothin' he says!

374
00:35:01,095 --> 00:35:02,262
Don't talk.

375
00:35:03,056 --> 00:35:04,973
You should not speak.

376
00:35:05,058 --> 00:35:06,224
I'm gonna kill him.

377
00:35:06,726 --> 00:35:10,562
When I fire, his head will be gone.

378
00:35:12,148 --> 00:35:13,398
Three seconds.

379
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:15,984
Don't give your weapons.
You don't owe me anything!

380
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:17,069
One.

381
00:35:19,072 --> 00:35:20,072
Two.

382
00:35:22,575 --> 00:35:24,284
Don't do this! They'll kill everyone!

383
00:35:25,078 --> 00:35:26,161
He's gonna kill him.

384
00:35:37,423 --> 00:35:38,799
Drop them!

385
00:35:41,052 --> 00:35:44,388
I'm impressed.
Very good use of intelligence.

386
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:50,602
Everybody stay calm, we'll be done soon
and then we'll be on our way.

387
00:35:58,027 --> 00:35:59,778
Bring me that knife.

388
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:06,868
What's this symbol?

389
00:36:08,162 --> 00:36:09,997
I like symbol.

390
00:36:14,252 --> 00:36:16,545
This is the symbol of the goat.

391
00:36:18,006 --> 00:36:20,465
The pet of Satan,

392
00:36:22,927 --> 00:36:24,219
they say.

393
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:29,850
- You have a case that belongs to me.
- Does it?

394
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:31,852
Yes, like your lives.

395
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:34,229
It was lost. He doesn't have it.

396
00:36:34,897 --> 00:36:38,483
Last time, the case, or you will force me

397
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,155
to cut

398
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:46,742
his heart out.

399
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:50,495
Do it, you piece of shit.

400
00:36:52,331 --> 00:36:53,665
Wait!

401
00:36:58,212 --> 00:36:59,212
Let me have it.

402
00:37:16,355 --> 00:37:17,522
Hey.

403
00:37:21,194 --> 00:37:22,194
You talking to me?

404
00:37:22,695 --> 00:37:24,196
Pick it up.

405
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,490
- Hand it to me.
- Go get it yourself.

406
00:37:26,574 --> 00:37:27,783
- What was that?
- You heard.

407
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:37,167
Now pick it up,

408
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:39,461
hand it to me nicely,

409
00:37:39,545 --> 00:37:41,713
or you'll get what he got.

410
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,216
Do it, Lee.

411
00:37:55,812 --> 00:37:57,896
You'll be all right, Billy.

412
00:38:05,321 --> 00:38:07,572
Respect is everything.

413
00:38:08,616 --> 00:38:11,159
Without respect, we're just people.

414
00:38:11,786 --> 00:38:13,662
Common, shitty people.

415
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:16,206
I'm sorry, sir.

416
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:19,167
It's not your fault.

417
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:24,381
Now what?

418
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:27,092
We're both fighting men.

419
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:30,178
And I respect that.

420
00:38:30,555 --> 00:38:32,389
And fighting men,

421
00:38:32,473 --> 00:38:35,642
they don't deserve to be killed like sheep.

422
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:39,146
But

423
00:38:43,651 --> 00:38:45,277
respect

424
00:38:45,945 --> 00:38:47,696
must be taught.

425
00:38:50,783 --> 00:38:54,578
Lie down with your face
on the ground until we leave.

426
00:38:58,457 --> 00:38:59,916
Don't challenge me.

427
00:39:01,294 --> 00:39:02,335
Get down.

428
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,761
Up.

429
00:39:23,816 --> 00:39:25,150
Are you afraid of me?

430
00:39:26,152 --> 00:39:28,195
No. I'm not.

431
00:39:31,157 --> 00:39:32,824
You should be.

432
00:39:56,641 --> 00:39:58,308
- I'm dying.
- Don't talk, Billy.

433
00:39:58,392 --> 00:39:59,893
Cut his hands loose!

434
00:39:59,977 --> 00:40:02,786
The letter... in my pocket.

435
00:40:04,287 --> 00:40:05,687
Alright, kid, I got it.

436
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:08,088
I got it.

437
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,794
I'm so sorry.

438
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:50,214
I believe you.

439
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:51,757
What was in the case?

440
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,221
A computer. Blueprint of a mine.

441
00:40:57,681 --> 00:41:01,141
A mine. What mine?

442
00:41:04,521 --> 00:41:08,732
The Russians stored nearly 5 tons
of weapons-grade plutonium.

443
00:41:08,817 --> 00:41:12,861
The mine was abandoned after the Cold War.
No one knows it's there.

444
00:41:12,946 --> 00:41:16,198
The blueprint shows
where the plutonium is stored.

445
00:41:16,992 --> 00:41:19,493
We want to stop it
before it gets in the wrong hands.

446
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,620
I guess that didn't happen, did it?

447
00:41:23,498 --> 00:41:26,333
This kid died so some dirtbag
can make bombs.

448
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,672
I'm so sorry.

449
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,675
Not as sorry as I am.

450
00:41:39,514 --> 00:41:40,597
Let's take care of him.

451
00:41:46,855 --> 00:41:48,439
"Dear Sophia.

452
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:54,236
"I wish I could find something different
to do besides just missing you,

453
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,113
"but I can't.

454
00:41:56,197 --> 00:42:00,993
"The team's treating me good.
We got each other's backs.

455
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:07,875
"I want you to know that wherever I end up,
I'll be wanting the very best for you.

456
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:12,004
"And if some miracle happens,
and I come back again,

457
00:42:12,088 --> 00:42:15,090
"I hope I'm still your man.
Much love, Billy. "

458
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:22,014
Why is it that
the one of us who wants to live the most,

459
00:42:22,098 --> 00:42:24,850
who deserves to live the most, dies?

460
00:42:24,934 --> 00:42:28,687
And the ones that deserve to die,
keep on living?

461
00:42:30,065 --> 00:42:32,232
What's the message in that?

462
00:42:33,735 --> 00:42:35,444
What's the plan?

463
00:42:36,404 --> 00:42:39,031
Track him, find him, kill him.

464
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:23,408
CZ-1492, come on.
Requesting a response immediately.

465
00:43:23,493 --> 00:43:24,827
Who's this bozo?

466
00:43:25,328 --> 00:43:28,205
CZ-1492, this is a secure air wave.
Do you read?

467
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,499
What's this about?

468
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,918
What's taking so long, Barney Ross?

469
00:43:33,002 --> 00:43:36,463
This should have been a walk in the park
for you guys. Where's the case?

470
00:43:37,173 --> 00:43:38,382
Don't have it.

471
00:43:38,466 --> 00:43:42,052
I warned you what would happen
to you mutts if you pulled this shit again.

472
00:43:42,512 --> 00:43:44,888
A good man died trying to get that case.

473
00:43:46,015 --> 00:43:48,058
- I'm sorry about that.
- Are you?

474
00:43:48,143 --> 00:43:49,726
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.

475
00:43:49,811 --> 00:43:52,896
But this sort of situation comes
with the territory, wouldn't you say?

476
00:43:52,981 --> 00:43:54,148
And so does payback.

477
00:43:56,651 --> 00:43:59,194
You know, Church, you're the kind of guy
that pulls the strings,

478
00:43:59,279 --> 00:44:00,737
and everyone else does your dirty work

479
00:44:00,822 --> 00:44:03,991
'cause you never had the guts
to do it yourself.

480
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:05,701
We're done.

481
00:44:33,313 --> 00:44:35,981
Sir, we got a problem.

482
00:44:36,065 --> 00:44:39,109
The digging has slowed down.
Too many are dying.

483
00:44:39,194 --> 00:44:40,277
They're exhausted.

484
00:44:47,076 --> 00:44:48,118
He's tired.

485
00:44:52,207 --> 00:44:53,916
Anybody else tired?

486
00:44:57,545 --> 00:44:58,795
Get more workers.

487
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,298
We've already taken most
of the men from the villages.

488
00:45:01,382 --> 00:45:03,133
Get all the rest.

489
00:45:03,218 --> 00:45:05,636
Women, children, all of them.

490
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:20,734
Show me.

491
00:45:25,865 --> 00:45:29,076
Now we know where it is. Right. Right.

492
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:32,246
Okay. I know what to do.

493
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,415
Good, I want the plutonium out
in three days.

494
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,710
Three days?

495
00:45:38,795 --> 00:45:42,589
I have people ready
to pay four million a kilo now.

496
00:45:43,883 --> 00:45:45,509
Three days.

497
00:45:45,593 --> 00:45:46,635
No more.

498
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:48,971
Understood.

499
00:45:49,973 --> 00:45:53,058
You're smart.
Imagine if 6 pounds of pure plutonium

500
00:45:53,142 --> 00:45:56,603
is powerful enough to change
the balance of the world.

501
00:45:57,897 --> 00:46:00,148
So, imagine what 5 tons would do.

502
00:46:00,233 --> 00:46:02,442
It's very interesting. Yeah?

503
00:46:11,828 --> 00:46:13,245
- Something's happening.
- What?

504
00:46:13,705 --> 00:46:15,664
The transmission stopped.
They're underground.

505
00:46:15,748 --> 00:46:17,749
Putting it down right here.

506
00:46:23,131 --> 00:46:26,258
Come on, let's hustle, hustle.
We gotta move.

507
00:46:27,302 --> 00:46:30,220
Christmas. Come on, Lee. Do you
even know what the hell you're doing?

508
00:46:30,305 --> 00:46:31,346
Five minutes.

509
00:46:31,431 --> 00:46:33,223
- Don't get your knickers in a twist.
- Right.

510
00:46:51,492 --> 00:46:53,660
Another transport truck.
Could be one of theirs.

511
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,662
Let's check this place out.

512
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:01,626
No shootin'.

513
00:47:01,711 --> 00:47:03,378
- Classics?
- Yeah.

514
00:47:05,506 --> 00:47:07,549
I've been dying to use these.

515
00:47:07,633 --> 00:47:09,009
We'll beat the truth out of them.

516
00:47:11,888 --> 00:47:13,722
Maggie, you tell the guys
to wait in the truck.

517
00:47:13,806 --> 00:47:15,140
Okay.

518
00:47:28,363 --> 00:47:30,447
- They're here.
- Yeah.

519
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,960
Speak English?

520
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:54,638
- He's slightly gigantic.
- So?

521
00:47:54,722 --> 00:47:55,806
Just sayin'.

522
00:48:04,857 --> 00:48:07,109
- He's really gigantic.
- I said that.

523
00:48:13,783 --> 00:48:14,783
Hey!

524
00:48:20,623 --> 00:48:21,998
Can't beat a classic.

525
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:24,459
I say we beat some info out of
these guys and get moving.

526
00:48:24,544 --> 00:48:25,627
Sounds good to me.

527
00:48:25,711 --> 00:48:26,753
Let's start with the midget.

528
00:48:26,838 --> 00:48:31,466
Calm down, boys.
I can get them to talk with much less effort.

529
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,097
What's she gonna do, give him a pedicure?

530
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,351
It's a little sick.

531
00:48:41,436 --> 00:48:42,811
Christmas, I need you to hotwire that truck

532
00:48:42,895 --> 00:48:45,105
and go back to the plane
and get the weapons.

533
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:46,731
Why don't you get
one of those cheese-heads to do it?

534
00:48:46,816 --> 00:48:48,150
Stop complaining.

535
00:48:48,234 --> 00:48:49,985
I should've bounced
one of these over your skull.

536
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:51,695
- How'd it go?
- We're on. Let's move.

537
00:48:51,779 --> 00:48:53,405
Cheese-heads.

538
00:48:58,077 --> 00:48:59,619
They call themselves Sangs.

539
00:48:59,704 --> 00:49:02,539
They say they control
everything east of the mountains.

540
00:49:02,623 --> 00:49:07,544
Robbery, kidnapping, assassinations.
Basically, a cartel for hire.

541
00:49:07,628 --> 00:49:09,045
How do you know the language?

542
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:11,006
Easy. Put it together.

543
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:14,551
It's a cross between
Ukraine and Bulgarian dialect.

544
00:49:14,635 --> 00:49:16,011
Impressed?

545
00:49:17,472 --> 00:49:18,597
A little.

546
00:49:20,016 --> 00:49:21,224
Christmas.

547
00:49:21,309 --> 00:49:23,310
- What?
- Why are you yellin'?

548
00:49:23,686 --> 00:49:25,896
'Cause you gave me the shit job, that's why.

549
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,273
I'm gonna shoot you in the face
when I see ya.

550
00:49:28,357 --> 00:49:29,941
Where are you?

551
00:49:30,026 --> 00:49:32,068
The 60-year-old death trap you call a plane.

552
00:49:32,153 --> 00:49:33,737
Well, what's taking so long?

553
00:49:33,821 --> 00:49:35,405
Because there's bridges out, signs missing.

554
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,866
I've been driving these dirt roads
for the last seven hours!

555
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,159
You done complainin'?

556
00:49:39,494 --> 00:49:41,495
Thanks for the sympathy.

557
00:50:04,352 --> 00:50:05,393
This is weird.

558
00:50:08,272 --> 00:50:09,898
Just like home.

559
00:50:10,191 --> 00:50:11,191
That figures.

560
00:50:15,238 --> 00:50:16,446
What the hell is this place?

561
00:50:16,531 --> 00:50:19,115
I believe it's an old Soviet Army base.

562
00:50:19,617 --> 00:50:22,410
Probably used in the '80s. Cold War.

563
00:50:22,828 --> 00:50:26,706
They most likely staged maneuvers
and practice attacks against the U.S. here.

564
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:30,210
Is there anything you don't know?

565
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,640
Great. Just what I need. 50-year-old pizza.

566
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:51,606
We'll bed down here for the night.

567
00:51:08,207 --> 00:51:10,584
This tastes like shit.

568
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:11,668
How's yours?

569
00:51:12,587 --> 00:51:14,671
Can't complain about rigatoni.

570
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:17,424
Plan ahead, fellas.

571
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:19,301
That's all I have to say.

572
00:51:19,385 --> 00:51:22,596
Y'all, what if you knew
you were gonna die tomorrow?

573
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,763
What would your last meal be?

574
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,890
- One choice.
- One choice?

575
00:51:26,434 --> 00:51:27,851
It'd probably be cereal for you, huh?

576
00:51:27,935 --> 00:51:29,436
And what the hell's wrong with cereal?

577
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,687
It's cliché©.

578
00:51:31,105 --> 00:51:35,233
You gotta be original. You know,
if you were an original, broad-thinking man,

579
00:51:35,318 --> 00:51:38,361
you'd probably come up
with some special cereal, like Earios.

580
00:51:38,446 --> 00:51:41,156
You know, just like your ear.
You know, pour milk on them suckers,

581
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,949
they just lay there and you don't hear shit.

582
00:51:43,284 --> 00:51:46,453
For the record, my hearing is 20/20.

583
00:51:47,913 --> 00:51:49,039
Barney?

584
00:51:49,624 --> 00:51:52,083
Donuts and most food that kills ya.

585
00:51:54,253 --> 00:51:55,837
That's deep, man.

586
00:51:55,921 --> 00:51:56,921
You think so?

587
00:51:57,632 --> 00:51:58,632
Maggie?

588
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,552
Crispy aromatic duck with plum sauce.

589
00:52:03,638 --> 00:52:05,013
Very sexy.

590
00:52:08,142 --> 00:52:09,476
But I like Italian, too.

591
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:14,648
I'm starting to think Italian's overrated.

592
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:22,656
Hey. What about me?

593
00:52:26,327 --> 00:52:28,411
My favorite Swedish dinner would be

594
00:52:29,872 --> 00:52:32,540
baby seal and whale ass

595
00:52:34,877 --> 00:52:36,086
in the summer.

596
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:43,134
But I'd really die for some Chinese.

597
00:52:48,683 --> 00:52:50,517
Then you're gonna starve to death.

598
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,145
All right, sweet dreams.

599
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,814
Hey, Barney. I'm not done eatin', man.

600
00:53:20,131 --> 00:53:21,631
Can I ask you something?

601
00:53:22,425 --> 00:53:23,800
Sure, go ahead.

602
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,846
Why are you so nervous around me?

603
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,558
I don't get nervous, Maggie.

604
00:53:31,642 --> 00:53:33,518
What is it then?

605
00:53:34,145 --> 00:53:36,521
I just like keeping a distance.

606
00:53:37,565 --> 00:53:40,233
Is it because you don't want
to know any more people?

607
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,487
Let's just say bad things have happened
to people I've gotten close to.

608
00:53:45,865 --> 00:53:48,241
Not a good way to live.

609
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,411
I know.

610
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:55,206
Do you think about
the young man who died?

611
00:53:57,168 --> 00:53:59,085
All the time.

612
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,213
You don't talk about him much.

613
00:54:02,548 --> 00:54:04,924
No, that's how we deal with death.

614
00:54:06,051 --> 00:54:10,054
We can't change what it is,
so we keep it light until it's time to get dark.

615
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:12,265
And then we get pitch black.

616
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:14,768
Understand?

617
00:54:15,603 --> 00:54:16,978
I understand.

618
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:23,067
Good night.

619
00:54:27,782 --> 00:54:29,365
Good night, Maggie.

620
00:54:54,517 --> 00:54:57,602
I swear to God, if he doesn't stop snoring,
I'm gonna shoot him.

621
00:54:59,647 --> 00:55:00,647
Gunner!

622
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:04,150
You rang?

623
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:11,908
I know it's a stupid question.

624
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:14,285
I don't suppose you have
anymore of that coffee.

625
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:15,662
Pot only makes one cup.

626
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:17,622
Yeah. That's what I figured.

627
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:20,291
Listen up.

628
00:55:20,376 --> 00:55:23,419
Those guys said the congregation of Sangs
are probably in this area,

629
00:55:23,546 --> 00:55:25,004
concentrated east.

630
00:55:25,339 --> 00:55:27,090
So that's where we're going.

631
00:55:27,174 --> 00:55:28,675
We're out of here in 10 minutes.

632
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:31,135
Get ready. Do what you gotta do.

633
00:55:43,983 --> 00:55:46,025
Houston, we got a problem.

634
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:48,570
Down!

635
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:01,457
We gotta get out of here!

636
00:56:01,542 --> 00:56:03,877
- Go!
- Go, go, go!

637
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:05,461
Go, go, go, go!

638
00:56:12,845 --> 00:56:13,845
Go.

639
00:56:22,521 --> 00:56:23,730
Save your ammo.

640
00:56:27,902 --> 00:56:28,860
Where the hell are you?

641
00:56:28,944 --> 00:56:30,695
I'm almost there.

642
00:56:31,238 --> 00:56:32,614
Hey, what's going on? Are those shots?

643
00:56:34,033 --> 00:56:35,074
Yeah.

644
00:56:37,953 --> 00:56:39,871
- What's happening?
- The Sangs got us pinned down.

645
00:56:39,955 --> 00:56:41,789
- Can you hold them off?
- Yeah, maybe with a tank.

646
00:56:43,417 --> 00:56:45,126
- Shit.
- What?

647
00:56:47,421 --> 00:56:50,590
They got a tank.
Come on. Come on! Come on!

648
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:01,267
Let's roll! Come on!

649
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:10,151
I'm out.

650
00:57:11,362 --> 00:57:13,071
One left. Why not?

651
00:57:29,338 --> 00:57:30,922
Hey, who did that?

652
00:57:31,382 --> 00:57:32,966
Not me, I'm out.

653
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:44,560
Hey, what just happened?

654
00:57:46,271 --> 00:57:47,772
Somebody got a little carried away.

655
00:57:48,148 --> 00:57:49,524
It looks that way.

656
00:57:49,608 --> 00:57:50,775
Where are the shooters?

657
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:54,779
I don't know, but if they wanted us dead,
we'd be dead.

658
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,949
Barney?

659
00:58:13,507 --> 00:58:15,174
Don't freak out.

660
00:58:23,851 --> 00:58:25,351
Small world, huh, Barney?

661
00:58:25,853 --> 00:58:29,564
Booker? Rumor had it you were dead.

662
00:58:29,648 --> 00:58:32,942
Yeah, I heard that, too.
So, how's life treating ya?

663
00:58:33,027 --> 00:58:34,777
Been better.

664
00:58:34,862 --> 00:58:36,446
You did all this?

665
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:38,698
I fly solo. I thought you knew that.

666
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:40,491
Yeah, I heard it, but I didn't buy it.

667
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:41,993
Well, now you do.

668
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:45,204
This your team?

669
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:49,500
Yeah. Gunner, Toll Road,
Hale Caesar and Maggie.

670
00:58:50,711 --> 00:58:54,130
Booker. You're the one
people call the Lone Wolf?

671
00:58:54,214 --> 00:58:57,216
I've been called that. But I have mellowed.

672
00:59:01,388 --> 00:59:02,805
Not that much.

673
00:59:04,224 --> 00:59:07,977
I heard another rumor,
that you were bitten by a king cobra?

674
00:59:08,062 --> 00:59:12,690
Yeah, I was.
But after five days of agonizing pain,

675
00:59:13,233 --> 00:59:14,942
the cobra died.

676
00:59:23,118 --> 00:59:25,369
Hey, Booker. Great to see you, man.

677
00:59:25,746 --> 00:59:27,663
So, how'd you end up
in this godforsaken place?

678
00:59:27,748 --> 00:59:30,374
We got ambushed by Sangs
about 100 kilometers east of here,

679
00:59:30,459 --> 00:59:32,001
killed one of my men, young kid.

680
00:59:32,085 --> 00:59:34,003
- Yeah, sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

681
00:59:34,087 --> 00:59:36,255
The Sangs are the lowest form of scum.

682
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,882
Shooting them has been a good business.

683
00:59:37,966 --> 00:59:39,175
Do you know who the leader is?

684
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:41,010
- Yeah, a guy named Vilain.
- Vilain.

685
00:59:41,595 --> 00:59:44,347
Yeah, he pretty much controls
everything in this area.

686
00:59:44,431 --> 00:59:46,849
You're gonna need more men
if you expect to get out alive.

687
00:59:46,934 --> 00:59:48,351
Can you help out?

688
00:59:48,435 --> 00:59:50,770
Sorry, Barney. I work alone.

689
00:59:50,854 --> 00:59:52,647
I understand. Thanks for showing up.

690
00:59:52,731 --> 00:59:54,315
My pleasure.

691
00:59:59,488 --> 01:00:00,488
Hey, Barney!

692
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:02,698
There's a village down the road.

693
01:00:02,783 --> 01:00:05,243
They're good people,
and they hate the Sangs.

694
01:00:05,577 --> 01:00:08,037
- Maybe they can help out.
- Thanks.

695
01:00:08,121 --> 01:00:09,622
Happy hunting.

696
01:00:17,756 --> 01:00:18,798
What happened?

697
01:00:19,591 --> 01:00:20,716
I'm still alive.

698
01:00:20,801 --> 01:00:22,343
That's a matter of opinion. What'd I miss?

699
01:00:22,427 --> 01:00:25,429
I'll tell you about it on the way.
Come on, guys. Unload these weapons.

700
01:00:25,514 --> 01:00:28,099
Looks like Christmas
came way late this year.

701
01:00:28,183 --> 01:00:29,809
Yeah, I love you, too.

702
01:00:29,893 --> 01:00:31,477
Well, I'm happy to see you.

703
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:34,272
Finally. Somebody with class.

704
01:00:41,864 --> 01:00:44,907
This has gotta be the town
that Booker was talking about.

705
01:00:44,992 --> 01:00:46,701
I could retire to a place like this.

706
01:00:49,872 --> 01:00:53,165
Clean air, no stress, raise some kids.

707
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:55,585
You know, Maggie,
I could retire to a place like this.

708
01:00:55,669 --> 01:00:57,461
You are so full of shit.

709
01:01:02,676 --> 01:01:04,010
Out, out, out!

710
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,101
They're missing us by a mile.

711
01:01:13,687 --> 01:01:15,730
- Put down guns.
- That's not happening.

712
01:01:18,191 --> 01:01:19,859
The safest place is in front of their gun.

713
01:01:20,986 --> 01:01:22,153
We will shoot you!

714
01:01:22,237 --> 01:01:24,530
No! Wait.

715
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:30,036
These guys are here to help.
They want to help.

716
01:01:45,344 --> 01:01:47,637
Even you two rejects
could get lucky around here.

717
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:49,138
- You think?
- I doubt it.

718
01:01:49,222 --> 01:01:50,348
Do you mind?

719
01:01:53,101 --> 01:01:54,310
Who you are?

720
01:01:54,394 --> 01:01:56,187
- We're Americans.
- Since when?

721
01:01:56,271 --> 01:01:57,313
Swedish.

722
01:01:57,397 --> 01:01:59,190
- Blackfoot.
- Chinese.

723
01:01:59,274 --> 01:02:01,359
- Retards.
- You done?

724
01:02:03,612 --> 01:02:05,154
What do you want?

725
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,782
We're here to take care of the Sangs.

726
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,957
Okay. Come inside.

727
01:02:18,669 --> 01:02:19,919
Come on.

728
01:02:29,596 --> 01:02:32,139
This is who we think you'd come for.

729
01:02:32,224 --> 01:02:33,474
This is who we will die for.

730
01:02:36,395 --> 01:02:39,772
First, they told us there'd be
good jobs, good money.

731
01:02:40,774 --> 01:02:43,150
Some went. But nobody come back.

732
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:46,153
They come for more.

733
01:02:46,238 --> 01:02:49,281
They say as soon as our men go to job,

734
01:02:49,366 --> 01:02:51,534
the others come home.

735
01:02:52,828 --> 01:02:54,870
My husband goes.

736
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:57,540
For a long time, we hear nothing.

737
01:02:59,918 --> 01:03:03,045
Then the Sangs come, and they take
all of the rest of the men.

738
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:05,339
Forced them to work in the mines.

739
01:03:05,424 --> 01:03:07,925
Same in the next village. And the next.

740
01:03:08,468 --> 01:03:10,136
They take my sons.

741
01:03:10,721 --> 01:03:13,556
Now all that is left are the very young.

742
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,142
And they will be back for them, too.
I know this.

743
01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:17,685
We all know this.

744
01:03:17,769 --> 01:03:20,312
So we hide them and we wait.

745
01:03:21,023 --> 01:03:23,232
Why don't you just move on? Leave.

746
01:03:23,316 --> 01:03:24,984
This is our home.

747
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:27,361
Our lives will be the last thing they take.

748
01:03:29,781 --> 01:03:31,407
Tell us why you're here now.

749
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:33,367
We're tracking them.

750
01:03:33,994 --> 01:03:38,122
Can't you stay and help?
You saw the children!

751
01:03:38,749 --> 01:03:41,083
Soon they'll be done,
and they'll kill them all.

752
01:03:41,168 --> 01:03:43,002
We have our own business with them.

753
01:03:46,506 --> 01:03:49,133
I'm sorry. Let's go.

754
01:03:57,684 --> 01:03:59,268
I don't think
they're gonna last here much longer.

755
01:03:59,352 --> 01:04:00,895
I think they know that.

756
01:04:00,979 --> 01:04:03,689
So we're not gonna do anything about it?

757
01:04:05,317 --> 01:04:06,901
I got an idea.

758
01:04:06,985 --> 01:04:08,986
And with your ego,
I think you're gonna love it.

759
01:04:09,071 --> 01:04:10,946
- My ego?
- Your ego.

760
01:04:11,031 --> 01:04:13,783
- What do you mean, my ego?
- You've got a big ego.

761
01:04:13,867 --> 01:04:15,117
Well, check your ego out.

762
01:04:15,202 --> 01:04:18,204
Please. Your ego is like
the size of a dinosaur. Huge.

763
01:04:28,215 --> 01:04:30,883
We have it. We found the plutonium.

764
01:05:47,961 --> 01:05:52,214
By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you

765
01:05:53,967 --> 01:05:55,050
man and knife.

766
01:07:07,582 --> 01:07:08,874
One more!

767
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,506
Rest in pieces.

768
01:07:24,266 --> 01:07:26,016
This is the last one?

769
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:27,601
Good.

770
01:07:35,735 --> 01:07:37,820
The chambers are cleared.

771
01:07:46,246 --> 01:07:50,332
No loose ends. You bury them all.

772
01:07:59,843 --> 01:08:03,345
I see about a dozen guards, light weapons,

773
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:05,139
a couple of badass. 50 cals.

774
01:08:05,265 --> 01:08:06,557
Worse.

775
01:08:06,641 --> 01:08:08,517
Anti-tank devices.

776
01:08:09,227 --> 01:08:12,438
There's no way our trucks will
get through that mine field.

777
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:14,148
Look, I know this is a stupid question,

778
01:08:14,232 --> 01:08:17,359
but you got any ideas
that won't get us killed?

779
01:08:17,444 --> 01:08:19,445
I got a few I'm thinking about.

780
01:08:55,023 --> 01:08:56,982
- Boom time?
- Boom time.

781
01:09:10,663 --> 01:09:11,663
Target in sight!

782
01:09:12,999 --> 01:09:14,875
- Baby wants to travel!
- Fire!

783
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:19,129
- Rock and roll!
- Fire!

784
01:09:21,633 --> 01:09:22,841
Bombs away!

785
01:09:31,017 --> 01:09:32,017
Tighten up!

786
01:09:32,102 --> 01:09:34,269
- What's happening now?
- Chaos!

787
01:09:35,855 --> 01:09:38,107
- You're not doing what I think you're doing.
- Yeah, I am.

788
01:09:38,191 --> 01:09:39,358
Let's do it!

789
01:09:43,571 --> 01:09:44,822
Come on, let's move!

790
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:12,391
You're gonna need a new plane.

791
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:34,663
- We're too late!
- What?

792
01:10:34,747 --> 01:10:36,165
The plutonium's gone.

793
01:10:42,881 --> 01:10:45,883
Come on, come on, let's get out of here!
Move, move! Come on!

794
01:10:46,134 --> 01:10:47,342
Go, go, go!

795
01:10:47,427 --> 01:10:49,011
Move it, move it, move it!

796
01:10:49,095 --> 01:10:50,262
Go, go, go!

797
01:10:50,889 --> 01:10:52,264
Go on, get out of here!

798
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:53,932
Go, go, go, go!

799
01:10:56,769 --> 01:10:58,395
Pick it up! Pick it up!

800
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:17,915
We're gonna be here awhile.

801
01:11:26,871 --> 01:11:28,747
Doesn't seem right.

802
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:30,582
Going out this chickenshit way?

803
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:31,792
Something like that.

804
01:11:32,418 --> 01:11:34,920
Hey, it ain't over yet, kids.

805
01:11:35,004 --> 01:11:36,588
I got a plan.

806
01:11:36,673 --> 01:11:38,257
Everybody calm down.

807
01:11:42,178 --> 01:11:43,387
Phosphate rock.

808
01:11:44,097 --> 01:11:45,305
What's he doing?

809
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:47,015
Probably making a bomb.

810
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:48,433
You serious?

811
01:11:48,859 --> 01:11:50,443
Ask him.

812
01:11:50,528 --> 01:11:51,820
What you doing, Gunner?

813
01:11:51,904 --> 01:11:54,864
I'm making a bomb. You mind?

814
01:11:57,076 --> 01:11:59,953
- A maniac with brains.
- Scary.

815
01:12:00,371 --> 01:12:03,581
Phosphate rock, it's got a density of 1.852.

816
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:05,625
Melting point, 44.2 centigrade.

817
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:08,336
Guys, I want some gunpowder, fast.

818
01:12:08,421 --> 01:12:10,755
Do it. The man's a chemical engineer, right?

819
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,925
And a Fulbright Scholar.
Pour it in the pipe.

820
01:12:14,593 --> 01:12:17,429
- The big man might be onto something.
- You think?

821
01:12:17,805 --> 01:12:19,472
Probably not.

822
01:12:19,557 --> 01:12:21,057
You need some help with that? Let's go!

823
01:12:21,142 --> 01:12:23,017
Here. Go blow yourself up.

824
01:12:23,102 --> 01:12:24,102
Lighter?

825
01:12:26,814 --> 01:12:28,106
I want that back.

826
01:12:28,733 --> 01:12:31,192
Better get back! This is gonna be loud!

827
01:12:35,364 --> 01:12:36,698
Get back!

828
01:12:37,908 --> 01:12:38,908
Okay.

829
01:12:39,744 --> 01:12:41,369
All right, let's go!

830
01:12:42,121 --> 01:12:43,538
All right.

831
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:47,417
Better turn around
unless you want your heads blown off.

832
01:12:47,501 --> 01:12:49,753
You better cover your ear.

833
01:12:50,421 --> 01:12:51,629
Come on.

834
01:13:01,891 --> 01:13:03,558
Well, the phosphorus must have been damp.

835
01:13:03,642 --> 01:13:04,642
Yeah, right.

836
01:13:04,727 --> 01:13:06,728
- Or you suck.
- There's that.

837
01:13:06,812 --> 01:13:08,354
Don't cry, Gunner.

838
01:13:10,775 --> 01:13:12,609
You almost had an idea.

839
01:13:38,844 --> 01:13:40,512
I'm back.

840
01:13:41,388 --> 01:13:43,264
How're you doin', Trench?

841
01:13:48,854 --> 01:13:51,773
- I thank you. I thank you.
- You're welcome.

842
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:57,570
Bojan!

843
01:14:23,472 --> 01:14:26,933
- We're even now, right?
- Right.

844
01:14:27,017 --> 01:14:29,519
I'll be seeing you around, Trench.
Thanks a lot.

845
01:14:29,603 --> 01:14:32,856
- Relax. It's not over yet.
- What?

846
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,691
That's right.

847
01:14:41,073 --> 01:14:43,116
- How ya doin', paI?
- I was doing pretty good, Church.

848
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,200
What are you doing here?

849
01:14:44,285 --> 01:14:47,370
- I heard there was a party in town.
- Yeah, but it's my party.

850
01:14:47,454 --> 01:14:50,081
- Has he always been this selfish?
- Always.

851
01:14:50,165 --> 01:14:51,374
Thanks.

852
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:59,465
You wanna kick Vilain's ass or not?

853
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:01,801
Don't forget the Little Rascals!

854
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:25,867
Move it.

855
01:16:02,863 --> 01:16:03,905
Move out!

856
01:16:30,557 --> 01:16:33,810
Take the rest of the nukes to the hangar.
Now!

857
01:16:33,894 --> 01:16:35,979
And get the plutonium on the plane.

858
01:16:45,447 --> 01:16:46,531
Follow me.

859
01:16:49,076 --> 01:16:50,493
We need to buy some time.

860
01:17:14,852 --> 01:17:16,060
Go, go!

861
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:38,958
I'm out!

862
01:17:48,343 --> 01:17:49,343
Hold them up!

863
01:17:50,971 --> 01:17:53,181
Go! Go! Move!

864
01:17:53,265 --> 01:17:54,265
Shit!

865
01:18:14,328 --> 01:18:15,995
- Fun, huh?
- Yeah.

866
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,622
There he is!

867
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:19,332
Come on, Vilain.

868
01:18:19,416 --> 01:18:20,958
- Let's go!
- Yeah.

869
01:18:21,043 --> 01:18:22,585
Tear him apart!

870
01:18:40,813 --> 01:18:43,439
I'm almost out. I'll be back.

871
01:18:43,524 --> 01:18:46,234
You've been back enough. I'll be back.

872
01:18:47,152 --> 01:18:48,402
Yippee-ki-yay.

873
01:18:54,493 --> 01:18:56,327
Who's next? Rambo?

874
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,542
Goodbye.

875
01:19:05,879 --> 01:19:06,879
Let's go.

876
01:19:10,425 --> 01:19:11,676
Maggots!

877
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:28,985
Start the engine!

878
01:19:29,069 --> 01:19:31,112
Get that thing in the air.
I want to make some money!

879
01:19:31,196 --> 01:19:32,196
Move!

880
01:19:38,328 --> 01:19:39,954
Trench! Get in!

881
01:19:44,042 --> 01:19:45,626
My shoe is bigger than this car.

882
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:49,714
Shoot something!

883
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:00,850
Come on.

884
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:24,749
Start the helicopter.
We have a special guest coming.

885
01:20:26,668 --> 01:20:27,919
Let's go!

886
01:20:44,645 --> 01:20:46,062
Take care of him!

887
01:21:18,637 --> 01:21:19,887
This way!

888
01:22:07,352 --> 01:22:09,562
Cannot beat a classic.

889
01:22:22,993 --> 01:22:24,702
- Barney!
- What are you doing here?

890
01:22:29,207 --> 01:22:30,166
I'm going in there alone.

891
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:32,460
Don't follow me, no matter what,
do you understand?

892
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,421
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

893
01:22:37,507 --> 01:22:41,969
That door opens up, and I don't come out,
and he does, you kill him.

894
01:22:49,853 --> 01:22:51,979
Let's make it more dramatic.

895
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:55,691
Now, that's better.

896
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:12,792
I'm out of bullets.

897
01:23:12,876 --> 01:23:14,168
That's your problem.

898
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:16,921
Not really.

899
01:23:23,762 --> 01:23:26,013
You wanna kill me like a man?

900
01:23:29,267 --> 01:23:31,227
Or you wanna kill me

901
01:23:34,773 --> 01:23:36,273
like a sheep?

902
01:23:56,753 --> 01:23:57,795
Nice knife.

903
01:24:13,311 --> 01:24:14,353
So.

904
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,689
What's it going to be?

905
01:24:20,318 --> 01:24:22,695
Man or sheep?

906
01:24:22,779 --> 01:24:24,488
You wanna man up?

907
01:24:26,825 --> 01:24:28,159
I'll man you up.

908
01:24:41,965 --> 01:24:44,758
You must want to hurt me bad.

909
01:24:45,218 --> 01:24:49,513
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm gonna take your life.

910
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:53,392
Come.

911
01:25:18,043 --> 01:25:19,627
Over so soon?

912
01:25:20,045 --> 01:25:21,712
I want my money's worth.

913
01:25:22,506 --> 01:25:24,507
- Come on, get up!
- Coming right up.

914
01:25:26,843 --> 01:25:27,885
Going back down.

915
01:25:40,899 --> 01:25:41,941
Taste good?

916
01:25:42,984 --> 01:25:44,026
Talking to me?

917
01:25:48,573 --> 01:25:49,782
Time to wrap this up.

918
01:26:17,102 --> 01:26:20,437
Ironic. Here we are, you and I.

919
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:22,856
And your knife.

920
01:26:24,901 --> 01:26:27,611
You're going to die. Like him.

921
01:26:29,739 --> 01:26:30,739
What was his name?

922
01:26:33,451 --> 01:26:35,369
What did you call him?

923
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:39,456
What does it matter?

924
01:26:43,545 --> 01:26:45,546
Come on, Vilain.

925
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:47,715
Somebody's dying.

926
01:26:47,799 --> 01:26:51,029
Come on, Vilain.

927
01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:54,330
Come on, Vilain.

928
01:26:54,973 --> 01:26:56,181
Come on!

929
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:21,582
Get up, Vilain.

930
01:27:26,087 --> 01:27:29,173
Get up.

931
01:27:34,512 --> 01:27:36,388
Now turn around.

932
01:27:37,349 --> 01:27:39,141
Turn around, sheep.

933
01:27:52,072 --> 01:27:53,113
Now what?

934
01:28:02,624 --> 01:28:04,541
His name was Billy.

935
01:28:25,355 --> 01:28:27,856
You know how to carve a turkey?

936
01:28:35,073 --> 01:28:37,866
- You win?
- I think so.

937
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:39,660
Well, where's the proof?

938
01:28:41,788 --> 01:28:43,080
Heads up.

939
01:28:48,586 --> 01:28:49,712
Nice touch.

940
01:28:52,215 --> 01:28:53,924
It is a nice touch.

941
01:28:55,093 --> 01:28:57,594
A little extreme. But nice.

942
01:29:01,433 --> 01:29:04,184
And as much as I hate to say this,
Bamm-Bamm,

943
01:29:04,269 --> 01:29:06,687
now that we got control of the plutonium,

944
01:29:06,771 --> 01:29:08,147
that makes us even.

945
01:29:08,565 --> 01:29:09,773
Good.

946
01:29:10,942 --> 01:29:13,777
So, Maggie, you'll be coming with us then?

947
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:17,322
When you're ready.

948
01:29:23,788 --> 01:29:25,372
So I just want...

949
01:29:36,384 --> 01:29:38,719
They're okay, just a little immature.

950
01:29:41,014 --> 01:29:45,225
I don't have to go.
If you want me to stay, I'll stay.

951
01:29:47,771 --> 01:29:50,189
And I did save the babysitter's life.

952
01:29:50,899 --> 01:29:52,524
That you did do.

953
01:29:52,609 --> 01:29:54,568
Maybe I'm good luck for you.

954
01:29:55,153 --> 01:29:58,614
But I could be bad luck for you,
and I can't allow that.

955
01:30:02,202 --> 01:30:06,580
If you ever want help, call me,

956
01:30:06,664 --> 01:30:07,915
or you're dead.

957
01:30:08,458 --> 01:30:10,125
I'll do that.

958
01:30:19,719 --> 01:30:20,969
What are you doing here?

959
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:25,015
Moving on. You killed all my business.

960
01:30:25,099 --> 01:30:26,558
I thought you were the Lone Wolf.

961
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,771
Sometimes it's fun to run with the pack.

962
01:30:30,855 --> 01:30:32,314
Sure, you got a point.

963
01:30:32,398 --> 01:30:33,732
You take care, Maggie.

964
01:30:41,658 --> 01:30:43,617
I almost forgot.

965
01:30:43,701 --> 01:30:46,203
As a token of my gratitude,
my violent friend,

966
01:30:46,287 --> 01:30:49,248
I got you and the Little Rascals a ride home.

967
01:30:51,334 --> 01:30:53,001
- Behold.
- What?

968
01:30:57,507 --> 01:30:58,882
Consider it a gift.

969
01:31:01,177 --> 01:31:03,804
That thing belongs in a museum.

970
01:31:03,888 --> 01:31:05,472
We all do.

971
01:31:06,558 --> 01:31:09,226
- Hey, fun, right?
- Yeah, fun.

972
01:31:10,812 --> 01:31:12,104
Take care.

973
01:32:06,451 --> 01:32:09,995
Beware, beware, walk with care.

974
01:32:10,079 --> 01:32:12,039
Careful what you do.

975
01:32:12,123 --> 01:32:14,958
Or Mumbo-Jumbo's gonna hoo-doo you.

976
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:17,669
Mumbo-Jumbo's gonna hoo-doo you.

977
01:32:18,129 --> 01:32:21,423
Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom!

978
01:32:21,507 --> 01:32:22,674
To Billy!

979
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,594
- To Billy.
- To Billy.

980
01:32:25,678 --> 01:32:27,137
Rest in peace.

981
01:32:27,597 --> 01:32:30,057
- Man, I need a massage.
- Don't look at me.

982
01:32:33,478 --> 01:32:36,355
- Hey.
- What?

983
01:32:36,981 --> 01:32:40,025
- From one friend to another?
- What?

984
01:32:40,818 --> 01:32:42,778
You really should learn how to fight.
