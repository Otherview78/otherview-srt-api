1
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:00,294
Hello!

2
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,830
Chuck Farnsworth? I'm Axel Bates.

3
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:05,174
You're also on with my partners, Anders, Bradley and Zeke.

4
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,302
Oh, my God. Thank you so much for calling me back!

5
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,405
I understand your daughter, Brooke, was taken 24 hours ago

6
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,908
on a business trip with your oil company in Mexico.

7
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:15,309
Yes!

8
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,045
I'll pay you guys whatever you want.

9
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:20,247
You just bring my baby girl home alive.

10
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,855
I... I can't see anything.

11
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:31,358
Brooke, I'm Cal. We're here to take you home.

12
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,628
Lean forward. I'm gonna cut you loose.

13
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,831
It's okay. It's okay.

14
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,601
Stand up.

15
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:42,704
Grab my vest. Don't let go.

16
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:35,455
Clear!

17
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,150
Zeke, get ready to go.

18
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,185
- Where's Axel and Bradley? - They're right behind us.

19
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,497
I'm hit.

20
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,901
I got you, brother.

21
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,242
Get in the van!

22
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,879
Bradley, drive!

23
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:33,246
Where's Zeke?

24
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,594
Axel, no!

25
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,476
Drive!

26
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,579
What's happening?

27
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,748
Where's Axel?

28
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:10,785
We gotta go back to get him. We can't!

29
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,454
I'm sorry, brother.

30
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,663
Could have saved you the trip. I'm still retired.

31
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:39,734
Well, so am I.

32
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:43,771
You just come all the way up here to say hi?

33
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:48,743
A guy's not allowed to come check in on his favorite cousin from time to time?

34
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:54,081
You up for a beer? I got a couple.

35
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:55,983
Oh, yeah. Love one.

36
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:03,057
Pretty out here.

37
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,031
Quiet.

38
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:13,200
Just the way I like it. Thank you.

39
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,476
Ever talk to Anders?

40
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,448
No. Last I heard, he was beach hopping in Thailand.

41
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,651
That was last spring though.

42
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:34,055
Right. That's what I'd heard too.

43
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:37,191
The number I had for him, there's no answer.

44
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,829
I was trying to invite him to my wedding.

45
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:47,668
Getting married?

46
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:50,972
I am, if you can believe that.

47
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,109
Uh, cheers to that.

48
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,544
Thank you.

49
00:07:57,645 --> 00:08:00,548
Who's the unlucky lady? Anyone I know?

50
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,951
You do.

51
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,554
Remember Brooke?

52
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,958
The Brooke from...

53
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,493
That's the one.

54
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:16,630
Fuck.

55
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,534
Uh, but, uh, congrats.

56
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:25,039
I guess losing Axel and Zeke wasn't for nothing.

57
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:28,642
Yeah.

58
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:31,345
It was rough, but they knew what they were getting into.

59
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,647
They knew the risks of the job.

60
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,816
Yeah.

61
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,052
We all did.

62
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:47,595
I want you to be my best man.

63
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,831
What do you say?

64
00:08:57,104 --> 00:09:00,041
Yeah. I'll be there for you.

65
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,177
Thanks.

66
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,684
Oh, my God. There's my baby.

67
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:45,286
Dad! There's my girl.

68
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,088
Look at you.

69
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:49,957
Dad. It's so good to see you.

70
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:51,725
So good.

71
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:54,962
You have time to call this off, right?

72
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:57,631
The heart wants what the heart wants.

73
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:00,234
Didn't your heart want it four times?

74
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:03,704
Okay. Where's Cal?

75
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:06,006
He's parking the car and bringing the bags in.

76
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,976
I see you still have your entourage.

77
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:11,345
Yeah.

78
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:14,024
After what happened to you, you think I'm gonna leave home without them?

79
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:15,584
You shouldn't either.

80
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:16,851
I have Cal.

81
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,919
And that's a long way from here.

82
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,955
Unfortunately, people still know I've got money.

83
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,490
Yeah, 'cause you don't hide it.

84
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,727
Nothing but the best for my baby girl, right? I mean...

85
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:29,663
I thought I was your baby girl.

86
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,832
Oh, you almost look as good as me.

87
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,003
This weekend's about your sister.

88
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,272
Hi, Daddy. Hey, baby doll.

89
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:43,244
Welcome, everyone. I hope you all had a pleasant journey in.

90
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:45,880
Yes, we did. Thank you. Oh, wonderful.

91
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,882
The rest of the hotel guests are checking out,

92
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:51,886
which means you and your wedding party will have the entire resort to yourselves

93
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,787
for the remainder of the weekend.

94
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:56,190
Seriously, Dad? Nothing but the best.

95
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,093
Is there any cell service here?

96
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:03,497
Uh, actually, you'll find that a few days out here is like taking a walk back in time.

97
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:06,233
That's why presidents and dignitaries from around the world

98
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,571
not only enjoy our seclusion and accommodations,

99
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,338
but also come back for repeat visits.

100
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:14,141
So there's no cell service?

101
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:18,746
No. But we do have Wi-Fi and plenty of beautiful mountain views.

102
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,250
Make no mistake, this is a weekend that you and your guests will never forget.

103
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:25,186
If you'll follow me, I'll give you a tour.

104
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:27,688
Go on over here. That's okay.

105
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,791
Now, as you can see, we're surrounded by pristine wilderness.

106
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:33,194
We have a 36-hole golf course,

107
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:36,063
15 miles of beautiful hiking trails.

108
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:39,700
We also have a spa on the grounds. Every treatment imaginable.

109
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,570
What celebrities visited here?

110
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,406
Oh, I'm not able to disclose exactly who...

111
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,647
Guess I found the right place.

112
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,016
Bradley, hey. Hey.

113
00:11:56,685 --> 00:11:58,052
I'm so glad you're here.

114
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,187
Ah, wouldn't miss it.

115
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:03,857
Uh...

116
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:06,894
You could have almost gotten married at my place in the mountains.

117
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,430
I don't have a lake like that though.

118
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:12,166
Oh, this is gorgeous.

119
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,835
Hey, my dad's here. You wanna come say hi?

120
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:18,506
Yeah. I suppose I should.

121
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:24,311
Over here is our five-star restaurant,

122
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:27,515
which will be hosting your rehearsal dinner later this evening.

123
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,150
Yes!

124
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:32,820
This is where your ceremony is gonna be.

125
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,389
Sorry. Chuck, good to see you again.

126
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:36,824
Bradley, good to see you.

127
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,693
Especially on better circumstances, you know?

128
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:40,094
Right. Give me just a minute.

129
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,396
Let me finish right here, and I'll be back.

130
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,530
Thanks.

131
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:45,966
Oh, this is my sister.

132
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,036
Uh, Hailey, right? And the maid of honor.

133
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,239
Bradley. The best man.

134
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:53,774
Nice to meet you.

135
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,242
You too.

136
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:57,579
You've exceeded all my expectations.

137
00:12:57,712 --> 00:13:00,981
Wonderful. Well, I'll make sure our staff has everything set up beautifully

138
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,651
for the big celebration in the morning.

139
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,953
Now, if you'll all follow me, we'll head to the casino.

140
00:13:12,493 --> 00:13:14,028
It's great.

141
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,283
All right. We got slots, table games, you know, fun for the whole family.

142
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,952
And I know it looks busy right now, but like I said,

143
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:13,954
this entire casino will be completely empty

144
00:14:14,088 --> 00:14:17,358
and only available to you and your guests later today and throughout the weekend.

145
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:20,894
Somebody was telling me this place had a safe room.

146
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,565
Oh, um, yeah, we do. I'd like to see it.

147
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:26,634
Oh, no. It's really nothing you would ever need.

148
00:14:26,768 --> 00:14:28,536
Where is it?

149
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,506
Um, yes, sir. Yeah. It's right this way.

150
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,693
You know, I'm out there in the lobby,

151
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:53,961
and I'm listening to this good-lookin' woman

152
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:56,798
talk about this big, tall, handsome blond guy

153
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,267
she saw sittin' all alone at the bar.

154
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:03,971
And as I listen to her describe the guy, I think to myself,

155
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,206
"I bet I know him."

156
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,676
And I do.

157
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,011
You didn't take the tour?

158
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:15,717
No. I'm... taking the tour of bourbon country.

159
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,252
I see that. It's great to see you, brother.

160
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,421
Good to see you too. Hey.

161
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,393
I wasn't sure you'd make it.

162
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:29,764
Hell, I wasn't even sure I had the right number.

163
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:34,334
Yeah, look, I... I still check my messages once in a while. It's...

164
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:37,404
In some countries, it's harder than others, you know?

165
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:41,208
Retirement looks good on you.

166
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,913
It does. Sun, sand.

167
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,113
Right.

168
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,415
Women. Well, you know.

169
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,319
There you have it. Uh, Thailand.

170
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:56,123
Ma'am, I'll do the same, please.

171
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,297
Thank you.

172
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:05,667
Thanks for coming.

173
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:08,168
I mean it.

174
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:12,674
Cheers.

175
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:22,249
Been kind of a long, hard road, hasn't it, buddy?

176
00:16:23,518 --> 00:16:24,552
Yeah.

177
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,788
Yeah, remember...

178
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:28,422
Remember that time in Afghanistan

179
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:33,026
we got cut into that bottle of confiscated grappa?

180
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,330
I thought my fuckin' teeth were gonna fall out from that stuff.

181
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,566
Well, you became a man that day. Bullshit!

182
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,036
I... I think I'd earned my stripes well before that night.

183
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:47,074
Stuck in the sand, drunk.

184
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,011
It was an impossible situation.

185
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:53,781
Next morning, we...

186
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,585
did what we had to do.

187
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:00,788
Yeah.

188
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,425
That, I wouldn't mind forgettin'.

189
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:07,762
Yeah.

190
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:10,665
That's why I drink to pass out.

191
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,468
Helps me to forget, I guess.

192
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:18,573
I guess Brooke's my vice now.

193
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:23,778
We kind of help each other get through the hard times together.

194
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:25,112
Mmm.

195
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:28,750
Well, in that case, if Brooke is your vice,

196
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:31,986
then this is my Brooke.

197
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,656
Cheers. Congrats.

198
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:38,091
Missed you. Missed you too.

199
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,266
All right, follow me this way.

200
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,770
This is where we, uh, make all the magic happen.

201
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:50,137
Don't mind the mess.

202
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,139
So our, uh, staff cafeteria is back that way,

203
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,192
and the admin offices are at the end of the hall.

204
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:57,045
Yeah. Well, you know, that's cool, but I just wanna see the safe room.

205
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,781
Ah, yes, well, it's actually, um... kind of doubles as two rooms.

206
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:02,482
It's our high-tech security room and it acts as a safe room,

207
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:05,385
which we have been fortunate enough to never have had to use.

208
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,254
All right. Now, there are two ways in.

209
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:10,625
One is typing in the code that only our security team and myself know.

210
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:14,394
The other is through the security guard, who's always stationed inside.

211
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:17,431
They monitor the entire resort at all times.

212
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,534
Then open the door.

213
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,269
Yeah.

214
00:18:30,712 --> 00:18:32,179
Right this way.

215
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,016
Now, our monitors are back here in the cage.

216
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:38,019
Please don't touch anything.

217
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,921
All right. Come on in, guys.

218
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:42,694
So these cameras just capture everything. It's all state-of-the-art.

219
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:44,792
If somebody drops a quarter on the ground,

220
00:18:44,926 --> 00:18:47,629
we can zoom in and tell you what year it was printed.

221
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:49,997
No.

222
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:53,500
What? Absolutely not.

223
00:18:57,705 --> 00:19:02,342
Yeah, that guy was a real prick. We all wanted to kill him.

224
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,812
Too bad he was a colonel. Right.

225
00:19:04,946 --> 00:19:06,648
No, lieutenant colonel.

226
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:07,882
Yeah. Yeah.

227
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:10,885
Yeah, he was from Connecticut.

228
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:14,254
There's my handsome man.

229
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:15,857
Hey. Well, wait, wait, wait.

230
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,492
That's what you're marrying? This guy?

231
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,730
Thanks for coming, Anders.

232
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:27,367
Yeah. I, uh, know it means a lot to this guy.

233
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,170
That's great.

234
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:35,242
Yeah, it's great. All right. Well, you guys, um, have fun.

235
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,549
I didn't interrupt anything, did I? No, no.

236
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:45,153
Just, uh, takes a little while to get to know him.

237
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,521
That's all.

238
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:49,189
Let's go cruise around. Yes.

239
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:24,625
Oh.

240
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:27,427
How you feeling, baby?

241
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:29,897
Me? I'm pretty good.

242
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:33,333
I was honestly, I think, more nervous couple of months ago.

243
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:35,002
Now I'm just excited.

244
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:38,172
I think that's 'cause of how much I love you.

245
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:40,407
This is why I make all the big decisions.

246
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,944
Damn right.

247
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,781
Okay, let's make a promise.

248
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:50,752
For our first anniversary, we go someplace tropical, right?

249
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:53,487
Where you can actually play golf outside.

250
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,526
I just wonder if I might have made a mistake.

251
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,828
Excuse me?

252
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:06,634
You think I should have made Anders my best man?

253
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:09,003
Come on, honey.

254
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:13,674
We talked about this. Get it out of your head.

255
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,511
This weekend is about us.

256
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:23,483
You're right. You're right. Hmm?

257
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,653
But, hey,

258
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:27,989
if anything ever happens to me,

259
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,526
he'll be there to protect you.

260
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:34,962
I like you.

261
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,300
All right. Let's see it. Okay.

262
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,936
You've had a couple of lessons.

263
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:43,237
Okay, wait. Okay.

264
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,972
Ready? Step one.

265
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:49,610
And... batter up.

266
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:50,945
This?

267
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,552
Yeah, that's good for baseball, but for golf, not so great.

268
00:21:57,685 --> 00:21:58,451
Why...

269
00:21:58,586 --> 00:21:59,887
Feel like a club pro here. Yep.

270
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:03,991
Okay, Miss Farnsworth, soon-to-be Gray.

271
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,060
You just get in there.

272
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:07,628
Getting the grip.

273
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:10,497
Put that left hand down like that.

274
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:13,000
Cover it up with your right hand.

275
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:17,905
Bring it back slowly, and then...

276
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:20,975
Uh, I'm sorry. I thought this was a golf lesson.

277
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:24,946
Ma'am, I don't know what came over me. I-I apologize.

278
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:27,582
Uh, here's what I'm gonna do.

279
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:32,220
I'm gonna give you the lesson for free as long as you don't tell my boss.

280
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:35,556
Okay, let's see a good swing now.

281
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,690
Concentrate. Okay.

282
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:49,670
My man. Good to see you.

283
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,038
Wonderful.

284
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:01,949
Yes?

285
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,951
All right. Now, look...

286
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:07,722
I'm gonna give you some advice, not that you're asking for it.

287
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:12,059
Have fun. Have a great weekend, but be careful, you know.

288
00:23:12,193 --> 00:23:13,861
She'll break your heart.

289
00:23:13,995 --> 00:23:15,062
Got it.

290
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:17,064
Mind if I play a bit?

291
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:18,498
Relax.

292
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:24,672
All right.

293
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:29,143
All right.

294
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:40,487
I always just thought that was a pickup line,

295
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:42,623
when he said he could play the piano.

296
00:23:42,757 --> 00:23:45,026
Who knew? Not bad.

297
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:48,396
Oh, no!

298
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,497
You're pretty talented.

299
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:52,934
Oh, yeah? You think so?

300
00:23:53,634 --> 00:23:55,036
I don't know.

301
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,942
Oh.

302
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:02,510
One more thing.

303
00:24:02,643 --> 00:24:04,845
Need you to hold on to this for me.

304
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:08,149
Guard it with your life.

305
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:12,520
All right? With your life.

306
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:14,021
I got it.

307
00:24:20,828 --> 00:24:24,799
That is a very big responsibility.

308
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:27,969
Fancy meeting you here.

309
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:35,142
So, what's your deal?

310
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,912
You and Cal.

311
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:40,214
Oh, uh, cousins.

312
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:42,149
Our moms are sisters.

313
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:43,317
Huh.

314
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:46,787
You two don't have a lot of family.

315
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:49,023
Are any of your relatives joining?

316
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:51,024
No.

317
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,361
Probably better that way. We're...

318
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:58,032
Well, our family is more likely to be the help than the ones getting help.

319
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,968
Guess you could say we're low-key.

320
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,005
I like low-key.

321
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:08,209
Do you, though?

322
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,846
Okay, burn.

323
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:14,949
Sorry. Cal told me that...

324
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:20,621
I should, uh, keep my eye on you.

325
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:23,524
In what way?

326
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,395
I don't know.

327
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:33,034
So I guess you won't be joining me then.

328
00:25:34,602 --> 00:25:35,836
Too bad.

329
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,811
Mmm.

330
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:58,893
Shit.

331
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:12,039
Guess this will do.

332
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:42,803
Want some?

333
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:50,911
Fuck it.

334
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,143
Oh, I haven't...

335
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:25,379
done that since high school.

336
00:27:35,624 --> 00:27:36,857
Why'd you stop?

337
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:43,063
I just wanna let you know that I was married.

338
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,000
Oh.

339
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:47,268
Okay.

340
00:27:48,435 --> 00:27:49,803
Was?

341
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:52,641
She died a couple years ago.

342
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:56,143
It's the only reason I took the job your dad offered,

343
00:27:56,277 --> 00:27:59,980
'cause I didn't expect to make it back.

344
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:04,151
I'm sorry to hear that.

345
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,288
But I'm glad you did.

346
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:10,891
My sister wouldn't be here if you didn't.

347
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:18,399
We can go back.

348
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:01,175
What was that?

349
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:02,443
Shit!

350
00:29:02,577 --> 00:29:05,680
Has it started? Oh, God, they're setting up.

351
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:07,114
Fuck me! Shit!

352
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:09,850
Oh, fuck!

353
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:17,258
Hey, Juan. How's it looking today?

354
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:21,663
Mighty quiet here.

355
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:23,915
I could use a lot more days like this. That's for sure.

356
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,469
So, is that, uh... Is that for me?

357
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:33,140
Oh, uh, yeah. Yeah, the, uh, father of the bride brought in his own Colombian coffee,

358
00:29:33,274 --> 00:29:34,709
so, I thought you'd like a cup.

359
00:29:34,842 --> 00:29:36,243
Thanks.

360
00:29:39,213 --> 00:29:40,281
Ah.

361
00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:42,116
Wow. That's good.

362
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:44,418
Yeah, bud, real... real Colombian beans, you know.

363
00:29:44,552 --> 00:29:47,021
Nothing but the best for this wedding party.

364
00:29:54,228 --> 00:29:58,299
Well, it don't look like I'm the only one here that could use a drink.

365
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:00,834
Mind if I join you?

366
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:02,369
Be my guest.

367
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:13,947
You know, it's a hell of a place you picked here.

368
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:16,850
Yeah, it is.

369
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:29,963
You know, my daughter got married. I didn't even get an invite.

370
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:33,133
Wow.

371
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:36,805
Honestly...

372
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:41,776
if it weren't for you guys, I bet this wedding wouldn't have happened either.

373
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:43,911
And I appreciate that.

374
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:47,915
I mean, I really do.

375
00:30:49,684 --> 00:30:51,151
Cal is a great guy.

376
00:30:58,092 --> 00:30:59,960
You know, he might be.

377
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:04,498
But that sure don't make this day easier.

378
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:12,439
But that might.

379
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,643
My turn to pour.

380
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:22,883
Okay.

381
00:31:24,184 --> 00:31:27,454
That's it, my friend. Cheers.

382
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:45,874
Yes.

383
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:47,609
Yeah, everything's on schedule.

384
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:49,677
See you soon.

385
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,248
Keep it together, Dad.

386
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,287
I got it.

387
00:33:03,885 --> 00:33:05,687
Oh, boy.

388
00:33:29,644 --> 00:33:31,111
Just let it come.

389
00:33:32,647 --> 00:33:33,815
Um, I'm gonna...

390
00:33:33,948 --> 00:33:35,449
Thanks. I'll see you. Okay.

391
00:33:38,786 --> 00:33:40,688
Okay. I got you. All right.

392
00:33:40,822 --> 00:33:42,256
Hey.

393
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:52,767
He'll be okay.

394
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:01,174
Right here. Chair.

395
00:34:01,308 --> 00:34:03,410
Which one?

396
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:06,748
Hey, Dad. Dad.

397
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:09,216
Sit, sit, sit, sit. Calm down.

398
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,688
Go to your seat. What?

399
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:15,355
Go to your seat.

400
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:41,983
She's gonna get married, okay? Shh.

401
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:43,483
You made it.

402
00:35:20,588 --> 00:35:22,590
Viktor, Marshall's putting C-4 on the exits.

403
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:24,324
Give him cover. No one gets out.

404
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,761
Nobody uses that door.

405
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:33,467
Clear them out of here.

406
00:36:04,632 --> 00:36:08,301
I see why you got those Michelin stars. Compliments to the chef.

407
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:12,874
Look, I-I've done everything that you asked, all right? Can I...

408
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:15,208
Fuck!

409
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,111
Jesus!

410
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:18,713
Stop.

411
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:20,048
Stop.

412
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,616
Stop screaming. Stop it. Sorry.

413
00:36:21,749 --> 00:36:23,250
I know. I know.

414
00:36:23,383 --> 00:36:27,220
Just gotta... internalize it.

415
00:36:30,124 --> 00:36:32,960
Besides, I did you a favor.

416
00:36:33,094 --> 00:36:35,697
You don't want anyone thinking you're in on this, right?

417
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:41,936
Perhaps I should have waited until you got us into the safe room.

418
00:36:44,172 --> 00:36:45,807
Some people annoy me.

419
00:36:52,013 --> 00:36:53,447
Shrimp cocktail?

420
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:01,589
Wrap it up. Let's go.

421
00:37:09,997 --> 00:37:11,666
May I have the rings?

422
00:37:18,072 --> 00:37:19,473
The ring.

423
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:25,913
The ring. Yeah, uh...

424
00:37:27,347 --> 00:37:28,516
Well, where are they?

425
00:37:28,649 --> 00:37:30,317
Uh, they're safe. I got 'em.

426
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,452
Are you kidding me? No.

427
00:37:36,157 --> 00:37:38,192
Just one sec. Shit, shit, shit.

428
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:39,560
What?

429
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,671
They'll be right back.

430
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:04,752
How'd a squirrelish fucker like you get in charge of a place like this?

431
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:08,623
Believe it or not, I'm... I'm actually really good at my job.

432
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:13,426
I think there's a kitchen staff that might beg to differ.

433
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:16,697
You... You said nothing about killing the staff.

434
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,668
So I need to give you my plans?

435
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:24,739
No, no. Here. Here we are. Here we are.

436
00:38:33,815 --> 00:38:36,117
The rest of the employees will give you no problem.

437
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,085
They've all been trained to do...

438
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:42,474
What the hell are you doing? He... He was knocked out cold!

439
00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:45,126
Now he'll stay that way. It's one less thing to worry about.

440
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:46,928
Guys, clear him out.

441
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,332
You... You do realize that as soon as you get the power,

442
00:38:52,465 --> 00:38:55,402
the backup generator's just gonna kick on in under a minute.

443
00:38:55,536 --> 00:38:57,437
Yes, Aaron, I do know that.

444
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:00,775
But it also shuts down the Wi-Fi.

445
00:39:00,908 --> 00:39:04,111
Which can only be restarted by an employee. You.

446
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:05,478
No Wi-Fi.

447
00:39:05,613 --> 00:39:07,347
No cell service.

448
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,749
No phone lines.

449
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:10,585
They're shit out of luck.

450
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:13,688
This isn't my first rodeo.

451
00:39:13,821 --> 00:39:15,723
Oh, my God!

452
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:16,891
Jesus.

453
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:22,597
Get into position. Wait for Viktor.

454
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:28,803
Oh, God!

455
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:30,370
Shut the fuck up!

456
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:34,275
We've all been shot before.

457
00:39:36,476 --> 00:39:38,079
Fucking headache.

458
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:02,803
Oh, God.

459
00:40:21,355 --> 00:40:22,723
What the fuck?

460
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:28,696
Is that it?

461
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:32,633
Yeah, man, we're good. Let's make our way to the security room.

462
00:40:59,827 --> 00:41:04,398
Okay, boss. All exits ready to rock and roll. Fantastic.

463
00:41:04,532 --> 00:41:08,736
Viktor. The boys are waiting for you. Why don't you go join 'em?

464
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:11,172
See if we can crash that wedding, huh?

465
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:14,909
Hey, Vik.

466
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:18,045
Do me a favor and save that first kiss for me, huh?

467
00:41:18,546 --> 00:41:19,547
Got it.

468
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,683
All right. What have we got here?

469
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:25,619
That's the first floor. Yeah.

470
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:28,055
Second floor. There's the casino.

471
00:41:28,189 --> 00:41:31,325
We're holding there, waiting to go in. Viktor will join.

472
00:41:31,459 --> 00:41:33,227
Well, all right then.

473
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:36,197
Let's give 'em a surprise. Let's rock and roll, baby!

474
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:53,948
Where the fuck did I leave this thing?

475
00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:02,857
The pool.

476
00:42:04,692 --> 00:42:07,094
Of course. You coming?

477
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,931
Hey, hey!

478
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:15,536
Hey, we gotta go. Everybody's waiting. Let's just chill for a second.

479
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:18,272
No reason to show up all sweaty.

480
00:42:18,406 --> 00:42:19,874
Nobody's going anywhere.

481
00:42:20,608 --> 00:42:22,643
Okay. You're right.

482
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:24,945
Everything's gonna be okay.

483
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,548
Look at you. You're a mess.

484
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:32,086
Sorry. I'm usually calmer in these situations.

485
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,320
Don't worry.

486
00:42:33,454 --> 00:42:36,991
CFO of my dad's company. I'm used to chaos.

487
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:54,008
Chuck sure did make this easy for us, didn't he, renting out this whole place?

488
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:55,409
Yeah, he did.

489
00:43:03,784 --> 00:43:06,587
You wanna watch some of this? When the fun begins.

490
00:43:08,222 --> 00:43:09,256
No.

491
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:14,695
Dad.

492
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:18,632
Hey, you might not feel good, but you're still looking good in the suit.

493
00:43:44,692 --> 00:43:46,595
Everyone, stay calm.

494
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:48,729
You run, and we'll shoot you.

495
00:43:54,603 --> 00:43:56,337
Get down! Get down.

496
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:09,650
- Take her. - Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

497
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:11,685
Come on! Come on! Go, go!

498
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:30,371
Think your sister's gonna be pissed?

499
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:32,139
No, she's gonna be fine.

500
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:40,247
Let's just take the stairs. Come on.

501
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:43,050
Uh-oh, uh-oh, oh, boss. Check out this one. Okay.

502
00:44:43,184 --> 00:44:46,820
Oh, hey, kids. Anyone tell you Fourth of July is coming early?

503
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:49,558
Three, two, one.

504
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,160
What was that?

505
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:55,530
Sounded like a bomb.

506
00:44:55,664 --> 00:44:56,664
What?

507
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,869
Head back to your room. Find cover.

508
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:03,837
What? Hell, no!

509
00:45:03,971 --> 00:45:06,575
I'm safer with you! Wait!

510
00:45:08,142 --> 00:45:10,244
Get your head down! Get your head down! Stay down!

511
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,875
Everybody, stop!

512
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,010
I'll take the guests to the holding area.

513
00:46:51,111 --> 00:46:52,880
Go see if they need help finding the others.

514
00:46:53,013 --> 00:46:55,482
You got it, boss. Let's go! This way.

515
00:47:50,404 --> 00:47:52,072
Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on.

516
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:55,342
I don't wanna leave you. That way. You gotta go.

517
00:48:01,516 --> 00:48:03,117
This way. This way.

518
00:48:03,752 --> 00:48:04,985
Come on.

519
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,426
This way. Come on.

520
00:48:26,974 --> 00:48:29,109
There she is. Oh, yeah.

521
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:32,446
Let me zoom in on that.

522
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:35,215
Hello.

523
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:37,585
Like catching fish without bait. You stay here.

524
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:40,688
I'll get us our lovely bride. All right.

525
00:48:45,993 --> 00:48:48,996
This is exactly what happened to my sister when she was taken.

526
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:50,364
Are we gonna be okay?

527
00:48:54,435 --> 00:48:55,469
All right.

528
00:50:01,101 --> 00:50:03,705
Boss says start checking the hotel rooms.

529
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:36,504
Stay here.

530
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:41,241
Come on! Come on! Come on!

531
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:54,054
You're lucky Axel wants you alive.

532
00:52:00,788 --> 00:52:02,590
I'm here to help.

533
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:06,594
Anyone there?

534
00:52:39,326 --> 00:52:40,862
Hotel security.

535
00:52:54,241 --> 00:52:55,910
I'm here to help.

536
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:08,843
I'm so scared.

537
00:55:08,976 --> 00:55:10,896
What are we gonna do? There's no "we," all right?

538
00:55:11,012 --> 00:55:14,048
You're gonna stay here, and you're gonna find a place to hide.

539
00:55:14,182 --> 00:55:15,415
What?

540
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:17,585
Look, they have thousands of security cameras.

541
00:55:17,718 --> 00:55:19,821
They could be watching us right now.

542
00:55:19,954 --> 00:55:23,233
Then we're gonna find you an exit. You're gonna head for the tree line and get help.

543
00:55:23,257 --> 00:55:25,425
I am not going out there alone.

544
00:55:26,627 --> 00:55:29,163
You used to get paid to protect people.

545
00:55:29,297 --> 00:55:30,698
Protect me.

546
00:55:31,532 --> 00:55:33,000
Bradley, please.

547
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:35,402
Please.

548
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:38,739
Fuck.

549
00:55:47,548 --> 00:55:49,116
Stay close. Okay.

550
00:56:29,891 --> 00:56:31,092
What happened?

551
00:56:32,492 --> 00:56:34,262
I had him.

552
00:56:34,394 --> 00:56:36,597
Who? Cal.

553
00:56:38,366 --> 00:56:39,734
He do this?

554
00:56:40,868 --> 00:56:42,236
Yes.

555
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:44,105
Bradley and Anders with him?

556
00:56:45,339 --> 00:56:46,339
No.

557
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:49,844
Just him and these guys.

558
00:57:06,394 --> 00:57:07,995
He's shit-faced.

559
00:57:11,532 --> 00:57:14,902
Guess if my daughter was marrying that man, I would be too.

560
00:57:17,405 --> 00:57:18,706
Chuck.

561
00:57:19,607 --> 00:57:21,809
You're gonna need some new bodyguards.

562
00:57:26,547 --> 00:57:29,150
These noises are fucking killing my headache.

563
00:57:29,283 --> 00:57:31,585
Let's get him out of here. Go somewhere else.

564
00:59:03,611 --> 00:59:04,979
Got him.

565
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:08,082
I'll search the exterior,

566
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:11,152
in case anyone made it out of any windows.

567
00:59:11,285 --> 00:59:15,890
Good. Remember, Cal, Bradley and Anders, alive if you can.

568
00:59:17,591 --> 00:59:20,995
'Cause I'd like to have a little conversation with 'em.

569
00:59:22,363 --> 00:59:23,597
Shut up.

570
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:27,701
Wake up!

571
01:00:15,316 --> 01:00:16,851
Holy fuck!

572
01:00:24,825 --> 01:00:26,660
Oh, there she is.

573
01:00:27,495 --> 01:00:29,497
Welcome back, buttercup.

574
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,166
What the fuck do you even want?

575
01:00:34,536 --> 01:00:36,505
Daddy? Hailey?

576
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:38,573
Daddy, where are you?

577
01:00:38,706 --> 01:00:40,641
Don't say another fuckin' word!

578
01:00:45,412 --> 01:00:46,647
Let him go!

579
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,682
No, no. I don't think so.

580
01:00:49,283 --> 01:00:50,284
Hello, Bradley.

581
01:00:53,354 --> 01:00:54,523
No!

582
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,390
- No! - We gotta go.

583
01:00:56,525 --> 01:00:59,260
I'm not leaving him. We gotta go. We got no choice. Come on.

584
01:00:59,393 --> 01:01:01,762
When he dies, this is on you, Bradley!

585
01:01:04,865 --> 01:01:06,300
That man is in need of a killin'.

586
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:39,159
Hey.

587
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:44,865
You knew him!

588
01:02:44,999 --> 01:02:46,343
This is all your fault! No. Hey, hey.

589
01:02:46,367 --> 01:02:48,703
Stop. Stop. Hey! Stop. Quiet, quiet.

590
01:02:48,836 --> 01:02:51,238
Hailey, please, quiet, okay?

591
01:02:51,372 --> 01:02:53,807
They're gonna... Who was that?

592
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:57,044
It was Axel.

593
01:02:57,177 --> 01:03:00,281
I thought you said he was dead.

594
01:03:00,414 --> 01:03:02,249
I thought he was.

595
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:06,053
If he kills my dad, it's on you.

596
01:03:07,589 --> 01:03:10,357
I just gotta... Hey. Get the fuck off me! Get off me!

597
01:03:11,392 --> 01:03:14,061
Can you keep it down. They're gonna find us. Fuck.

598
01:03:22,737 --> 01:03:23,971
Hey.

599
01:03:46,528 --> 01:03:48,829
My-My-My dad has a phone.

600
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:52,866
He has a satellite phone.

601
01:03:53,934 --> 01:03:56,470
What do you mean, he's... His room.

602
01:04:04,713 --> 01:04:06,180
Come on.

603
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:11,586
Hi, Chuck.

604
01:04:12,486 --> 01:04:13,887
You know who I am?

605
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,958
We've never had the pleasure of meeting in person,

606
01:04:18,092 --> 01:04:20,327
but we have spoken on the phone a few times.

607
01:04:24,064 --> 01:04:26,367
I talk to a lot of fuckin' people.

608
01:04:29,571 --> 01:04:32,473
Does the name Axel Bates ring a bell?

609
01:04:38,813 --> 01:04:41,181
You're a dead man.

610
01:04:41,315 --> 01:04:42,349
Well,

611
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,253
death certainly would have been merciful.

612
01:04:46,387 --> 01:04:49,089
But instead, I was picked up by those friendly folk

613
01:04:49,223 --> 01:04:51,392
who kidnapped your daughter.

614
01:04:52,827 --> 01:04:54,461
Tortured me for a couple of months.

615
01:04:54,596 --> 01:04:56,897
Unfortunately for them,

616
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:59,366
they just got a little too comfortable with me.

617
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:01,969
So they're gone.

618
01:05:03,404 --> 01:05:07,174
And here I am with a fresh, new perspective on life.

619
01:05:09,376 --> 01:05:13,147
Let me tell you something, you son of a bitch.

620
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,016
All I wanted was to get my daughter back.

621
01:05:16,785 --> 01:05:18,185
What about Zeke?

622
01:05:18,887 --> 01:05:20,187
He was someone's kid.

623
01:05:20,822 --> 01:05:22,456
And he has a daughter.

624
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:24,893
Zoey is five years old right now.

625
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:28,596
And guess what, Chuck? Her daddy ain't ever comin' home.

626
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:32,232
So let me ask you:

627
01:05:33,233 --> 01:05:36,170
Is Brooke's life more valuable than Zeke?

628
01:05:40,474 --> 01:05:42,075
No!

629
01:05:43,878 --> 01:05:44,878
Goddamn right.

630
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:46,980
No!

631
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,418
No, you didn't...

632
01:05:51,553 --> 01:05:53,621
No. No!

633
01:06:16,778 --> 01:06:21,683
It's okay. Come on.

634
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,229
Put some pressure on it.

635
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,268
That was the first place I was shot.

636
01:06:43,771 --> 01:06:45,038
That's the second.

637
01:06:45,172 --> 01:06:47,675
And it left me with a hell of a headache.

638
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:51,111
You wanna see what it feels like? No, no, no, no. No.

639
01:06:52,412 --> 01:06:54,314
I'll do whatever.

640
01:06:54,448 --> 01:06:55,482
Good.

641
01:06:57,184 --> 01:07:00,922
Because you offered us five million dollars to bring your daughter home.

642
01:07:01,054 --> 01:07:02,524
I want my share.

643
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:04,826
Is that what you want?

644
01:07:04,959 --> 01:07:06,393
You want a million bucks?

645
01:07:06,528 --> 01:07:09,162
I'll make it happen. No.

646
01:07:10,097 --> 01:07:11,633
No, no.

647
01:07:12,734 --> 01:07:15,469
What are both your daughters' lives worth to you?

648
01:07:16,036 --> 01:07:18,438
Two times? Three?

649
01:07:20,975 --> 01:07:22,744
I don't have that kind of money.

650
01:07:22,877 --> 01:07:23,912
Fine.

651
01:07:25,178 --> 01:07:27,582
No! Oh, no!

652
01:07:28,115 --> 01:07:30,384
Oh, shit.

653
01:07:30,518 --> 01:07:32,152
You want five million dollars?

654
01:07:32,286 --> 01:07:33,646
I'll give you five million dollars.

655
01:07:33,688 --> 01:07:36,390
That's not enough for what I went through.

656
01:07:37,525 --> 01:07:38,726
7.5.

657
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:43,163
But I promise you, that's all I can get out.

658
01:07:46,568 --> 01:07:47,301
Okay.

659
01:07:47,434 --> 01:07:49,336
I can live with that.

660
01:07:50,939 --> 01:07:53,675
I don't begrudge you for what you did, Chuck.

661
01:07:53,808 --> 01:07:57,377
Any father with your means would have done the exact same thing.

662
01:07:58,913 --> 01:08:02,584
But Cal, Bradley, Anders,

663
01:08:04,018 --> 01:08:05,620
they made their choice.

664
01:08:05,753 --> 01:08:08,121
And now it's time for their reckoning.

665
01:08:09,591 --> 01:08:12,760
Listen. Now, I don't care.

666
01:08:15,462 --> 01:08:17,497
Just don't hurt my daughters.

667
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,870
You do what you say you're gonna do,

668
01:08:23,004 --> 01:08:25,272
you have my word.

669
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:28,876
You fuck with me, I'm gonna kill everyone in here.

670
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:32,412
And then I'm gonna make you watch while I kill your daughters.

671
01:08:32,547 --> 01:08:33,848
Got it?

672
01:08:33,982 --> 01:08:35,382
Got it.

673
01:08:37,051 --> 01:08:38,118
I got it.

674
01:08:38,251 --> 01:08:39,251
Hey, gang.

675
01:08:39,353 --> 01:08:40,989
Pay close attention now.

676
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:45,359
We have, uh, five wedding members currently roaming the hallways.

677
01:08:45,492 --> 01:08:47,294
Ooh, get this. In the kitchen,

678
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:50,665
yeah, we have the lovely bride-to-be, Brooke.

679
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:55,770
I think that she is with a blast from the past, Anders.

680
01:08:55,903 --> 01:08:57,939
Asshole.

681
01:08:58,072 --> 01:08:59,540
And that's not all, gang.

682
01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:04,344
And we have the bride's sister, Hailey, maid of honor.

683
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:06,114
Yep. On the third-floor suite.

684
01:09:06,246 --> 01:09:09,017
And she's with the best man, Bradley.

685
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:12,820
But watch out, Bradley's got a gun, and it does go bang, bang.

686
01:09:12,954 --> 01:09:14,221
All right.

687
01:09:14,354 --> 01:09:17,058
And then, gang, our number one target, Cal,

688
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:20,028
the unlucky groom.

689
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:23,296
Looks like he's heading to the top-floor suites, I believe.

690
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:26,567
Happy hunting.

691
01:09:26,701 --> 01:09:29,904
We have to go. Wait, wait, wait.

692
01:09:30,038 --> 01:09:32,740
Someone will come. But don't worry, I have a plan.

693
01:09:32,874 --> 01:09:33,975
You need to surrender.

694
01:09:34,108 --> 01:09:35,743
What? Yes.

695
01:09:35,877 --> 01:09:38,278
Put your hands up, stay right here and surrender.

696
01:09:38,412 --> 01:09:40,380
Trust me. I'll handle the rest.

697
01:09:40,515 --> 01:09:42,617
Okay. I'm not leaving you.

698
01:09:52,426 --> 01:09:53,895
Get on your knees!

699
01:09:55,063 --> 01:09:56,764
Where's Anders? No.

700
01:10:02,402 --> 01:10:04,271
Let's go get me my money.

701
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:06,273
Come on.

702
01:10:07,508 --> 01:10:09,677
Okay. Okay.

703
01:10:21,122 --> 01:10:22,724
Over there. Yeah.

704
01:11:20,681 --> 01:11:22,583
What's this moron doing? Jesus.

705
01:11:29,123 --> 01:11:31,959
Hey, dipshit. Everyone's supposed to go to the restaurant.

706
01:11:34,262 --> 01:11:36,998
Ah, but since you have the lovely bride that-was-to-be,

707
01:11:37,131 --> 01:11:40,367
what do you say we have a little fun, huh?

708
01:11:41,702 --> 01:11:43,938
Fuck you.

709
01:12:05,793 --> 01:12:07,829
I never did like you, Anders.

710
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:11,430
Fuck you!

711
01:12:24,712 --> 01:12:27,081
It was him or us. Good choice.

712
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:31,451
Okay, give it to me.

713
01:12:33,855 --> 01:12:36,724
Good. Everything's okay.

714
01:12:52,607 --> 01:12:54,709
One, two...

715
01:12:55,576 --> 01:12:57,712
What are you doing?

716
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,650
One, two, three, four, five.

717
01:13:02,783 --> 01:13:05,586
They're searching the rooms. Five seconds in each room.

718
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,889
I'll be right back. Find that phone.

719
01:13:15,863 --> 01:13:18,900
They're holding the guests hostage in the restaurant.

720
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:31,913
Where are you going?

721
01:13:33,114 --> 01:13:34,348
Do my job.

722
01:13:34,481 --> 01:13:35,716
Here. Take this.

723
01:13:36,284 --> 01:13:38,019
Now you know how to use it.

724
01:13:44,558 --> 01:13:46,661
Lock the door after I'm gone.

725
01:14:44,819 --> 01:14:47,922
Fuck.

726
01:14:50,624 --> 01:14:52,226
Bradley!

727
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,661
Help!

728
01:14:59,266 --> 01:15:01,235
Don't shoot me. Please, please. Hey!

729
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:22,857
Help. Please. Please. Please.

730
01:15:32,066 --> 01:15:33,801
Hello, hello. Police?

731
01:15:33,934 --> 01:15:35,403
911. What's your emergency?

732
01:15:35,536 --> 01:15:39,073
Oh! Please! The hotel has been taken over by terrorists.

733
01:16:09,437 --> 01:16:10,871
Please hurry!

734
01:16:11,005 --> 01:16:14,675
Ma'am, the closest police force is 30 minutes away.

735
01:16:14,809 --> 01:16:17,711
You need to hurry! We'll be dead by then!

736
01:17:10,565 --> 01:17:11,966
No!

737
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:22,176
Oh, God.

738
01:17:23,911 --> 01:17:25,646
Oh, God. Hailey.

739
01:18:52,433 --> 01:18:54,902
Hailey, it's over!

740
01:19:01,242 --> 01:19:04,613
There is no way out of this. They're all dead.

741
01:19:04,745 --> 01:19:06,747
I have nothing to do with this!

742
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,183
Take it up with my boss.

743
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:11,653
Come back for more?

744
01:19:11,785 --> 01:19:13,487
No weapons, huh?

745
01:19:13,622 --> 01:19:14,955
Don't need one.

746
01:19:31,338 --> 01:19:32,338
Fuck.

747
01:19:39,681 --> 01:19:41,549
No!

748
01:19:44,385 --> 01:19:45,419
Stop!

749
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:04,506
Bradley!

750
01:20:12,714 --> 01:20:15,015
Cal! Help him!

751
01:20:36,571 --> 01:20:38,272
Help me!

752
01:20:40,374 --> 01:20:41,475
Grab him.

753
01:20:43,877 --> 01:20:45,245
Okay.

754
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,483
Got him? Yeah. Hang in there, baby.

755
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:29,022
Stay here. You'll be safe. Just stay here.

756
01:21:33,227 --> 01:21:35,462
All right. You're safe. Stay here.

757
01:21:35,996 --> 01:21:37,231
All right, good.

758
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:46,206
Marshall, open up!

759
01:21:49,811 --> 01:21:52,045
Marshall!

760
01:21:53,113 --> 01:21:55,015
- I need the computer. - Open up.

761
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:02,557
I need the computer. Open up!

762
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:06,694
Okay.

763
01:22:17,438 --> 01:22:21,208
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Baby, I'm sorry.

764
01:22:21,341 --> 01:22:23,678
Okay, okay. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

765
01:22:23,812 --> 01:22:24,813
Daddy.

766
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:27,047
Oh, my God!

767
01:22:27,181 --> 01:22:28,616
I'm okay.

768
01:22:30,184 --> 01:22:31,952
You don't tell them. You hear me?

769
01:22:34,988 --> 01:22:36,457
What the fuck?

770
01:22:37,525 --> 01:22:39,193
I'm so sorry.

771
01:22:41,563 --> 01:22:42,563
Open the door.

772
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:44,566
Open the door!

773
01:22:47,769 --> 01:22:50,638
Open the fucking door! Fuck!

774
01:22:52,574 --> 01:22:53,908
No, no, no, no, no!

775
01:22:54,041 --> 01:22:55,375
Don't open this door!

776
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:57,150
I'll give you a count of three. One, two...

777
01:22:57,277 --> 01:22:58,847
Don't you open this door.

778
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:01,315
Daddy! Oh, my ear!

779
01:23:01,448 --> 01:23:03,718
Open the fucking door! Oh, shit!

780
01:23:08,723 --> 01:23:11,593
You okay? I'm okay. Okay. I'm okay.

781
01:23:11,726 --> 01:23:13,895
Oh, God. I'm okay. Shh, shh, okay, Dad.

782
01:23:14,061 --> 01:23:16,196
Got into your account. Need the password.

783
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:17,998
I can barely hear!

784
01:23:18,131 --> 01:23:20,969
- Hey. Shithead. Password now. - All lowercase!

785
01:23:21,101 --> 01:23:22,737
All lowercase words.

786
01:23:24,572 --> 01:23:25,773
"brooke55...

787
01:23:27,976 --> 01:23:29,376
hailey819."

788
01:23:29,511 --> 01:23:32,614
- Oh, baby. Oh, my God. - It's okay. Come on.

789
01:23:36,518 --> 01:23:38,953
- Goddamn, Chuck. - Okay, okay.

790
01:23:39,086 --> 01:23:41,188
- You might be able to do 7.5? - Okay.

791
01:23:41,321 --> 01:23:42,590
Fuckin' liar.

792
01:23:42,724 --> 01:23:43,892
It's okay.

793
01:23:44,024 --> 01:23:45,960
That's it. Pleasure doing business with you.

794
01:23:46,093 --> 01:23:49,496
Come on, sweetheart. Time to go find your hubby. No! No! No!

795
01:23:49,631 --> 01:23:50,765
No, you're not.

796
01:23:50,899 --> 01:23:57,605
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

797
01:24:00,307 --> 01:24:02,175
Help! It's okay.

798
01:24:02,911 --> 01:24:05,379
Okay. Okay.

799
01:24:06,848 --> 01:24:08,482
Help me!

800
01:24:17,625 --> 01:24:18,826
This way.

801
01:24:22,931 --> 01:24:24,064
Help!

802
01:24:24,197 --> 01:24:26,099
Hailey!

803
01:24:27,434 --> 01:24:30,237
Open the door! Hailey!

804
01:24:31,204 --> 01:24:33,340
Open the door!

805
01:24:34,676 --> 01:24:37,512
Daddy, open the door!

806
01:24:42,917 --> 01:24:44,084
Oh, my God. Daddy.

807
01:24:44,217 --> 01:24:47,087
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, God.

808
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:49,057
I'm okay. Keep the pressure on that.

809
01:24:49,189 --> 01:24:51,025
Okay. Okay. Where's Brooke?

810
01:24:51,158 --> 01:24:52,326
Axel took...

811
01:24:52,459 --> 01:24:54,696
Axel took her. My God!

812
01:24:54,829 --> 01:24:56,631
Axel took her.

813
01:24:56,764 --> 01:24:59,601
Oh, my God! I know. Daddy's okay. Daddy, it's okay. It's okay.

814
01:25:00,568 --> 01:25:03,337
Right. Stay here. Stay here. There was nothing...

815
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:06,541
Keep pressure on the wound. There was nothing I could do!

816
01:25:06,674 --> 01:25:08,643
Daddy! Daddy!

817
01:25:08,776 --> 01:25:12,614
Okay, come on. Come on. Okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

818
01:25:14,949 --> 01:25:16,551
Cal!

819
01:25:16,684 --> 01:25:18,820
I said, shut your fucking mouth.

820
01:26:01,596 --> 01:26:02,596
Jesus.

821
01:26:02,664 --> 01:26:05,700
One shot. I'll follow your lead.

822
01:26:06,466 --> 01:26:08,703
It's Axel. I know.

823
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:18,445
Axel Bates, you fuckin' rat.

824
01:26:18,579 --> 01:26:20,247
You're a dead man.

825
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:24,284
No, I've already been dead. Your turn.

826
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,122
Well, lookee here.

827
01:26:28,255 --> 01:26:30,124
We got the band back together.

828
01:26:30,257 --> 01:26:35,195
Hey, Axel. Take it easy. All right? You don't have to do this. Okay?

829
01:26:35,328 --> 01:26:36,831
You're a fuckin' asshole.

830
01:26:36,964 --> 01:26:39,767
And you, Bradley, of all the people, you left me to die.

831
01:26:39,901 --> 01:26:40,902
Hey, hey!

832
01:26:41,035 --> 01:26:43,171
It was my decision to leave you behind. Okay?

833
01:26:43,303 --> 01:26:45,773
I thought you were dead. All right?

834
01:26:45,907 --> 01:26:48,408
Just let 'em go. Okay?

835
01:26:48,543 --> 01:26:50,745
You can kill me. Just let 'em go.

836
01:26:51,546 --> 01:26:53,948
Okay. Drop the fucking gun!

837
01:26:54,082 --> 01:26:56,249
No! No fuckin' way.

838
01:26:56,383 --> 01:26:58,385
Anders, drop the gun.

839
01:26:58,519 --> 01:27:00,454
Drop it, or she's dead. Now!

840
01:27:00,588 --> 01:27:02,890
Hey, drop it, Anders.

841
01:27:04,092 --> 01:27:05,993
Hey. Remember the colonel.

842
01:27:06,127 --> 01:27:09,664
Yeah. Whatever the fuck that is, remember it.

843
01:27:13,233 --> 01:27:14,769
All right. You got me.

844
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,209
There you go.

845
01:27:21,341 --> 01:27:23,010
Why don't you go join 'em?

846
01:27:25,213 --> 01:27:29,316
You, princess, I made a promise to keep you alive.

847
01:27:31,652 --> 01:27:33,955
Guess I'll keep it. Run along, little one.

848
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:37,125
Ha.

849
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:41,028
Baby.

850
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:54,842
It's us.

851
01:27:59,213 --> 01:28:01,849
Bradley! Are you okay?

852
01:28:01,983 --> 01:28:04,018
Hey. I'll be fine.

853
01:28:18,365 --> 01:28:19,600
Hey.

854
01:28:23,037 --> 01:28:24,471
With my life.

855
01:28:25,907 --> 01:28:29,110
Where's that damn manager?

856
01:28:29,243 --> 01:28:33,014
I'll get you a minister. Just don't invite me to the wedding.

857
01:28:39,053 --> 01:28:40,087
Okay.

858
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:47,895
I love you all.
