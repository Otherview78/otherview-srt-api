1
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,780
What is this place?

2
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,383
<i>My life doesn't
really make sense.</i>

3
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,676
- Hey.
- Oh...

4
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,261
<i>I used to ask myself
a lot of questions</i>

5
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:58,971
<i>about that.</i>

6
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:01,098
<i>"Scott, you're
a divorced ex-con.</i>

7
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:02,892
<i>"How are you an Avenger?</i>

8
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:04,852
<i>"Why are you time traveling
with Captain America?</i>

9
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:07,313
<i>"That doesn't make sense."</i>

10
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:09,940
<i>A lot has changed
about my life.</i>

11
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,651
<i>But everywhere I go,
people ask me the same thing.</i>

12
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:13,986
Can you take a picture
with my dog?

13
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,614
<i>"Scott, what about now?"</i>

14
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,823
<i>"What's next?"</i>

15
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:18,908
<i>"Where does
the ride take you?"</i>

16
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,203
<i>If I knew that,
it wouldn't be a ride.</i>

17
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,371
All right.

18
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,290
- <i>It's been a crazy few years.</i>
- Hey, guys.

19
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:27,958
- Hey, hi. How are you?
- <i>For everyone.</i>

20
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,543
Everything
is ready for you.

21
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,711
You're too much.

22
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,254
No, no, no.

23
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,464
Your money's no good here.

24
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,007
Aw. Are we still talking
about that?

25
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:36,092
Yes, of course.

26
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,552
Ruben, you are the best.

27
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:41,263
Thank you, Spider-Man.

28
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,976
<i>So, let's make time for
the stuff that really matters.</i>

29
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,353
<i>Like friends.</i>

30
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,147
<i>Friends you didn't
even know you had.</i>

31
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,235
<i>Remember the people
who got you here.</i>

32
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:55,653
<i>You couldn't have done it
without them.</i>

33
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,657
<i>Hey, I'm just a guy who
got fired from Baskin-Robbins.</i>

34
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,243
<i>Sometimes you just get lucky.</i>

35
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,370
<i>I'm lucky I met Hope Van Dyne.</i>

36
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:05,913
<i>I think you know who she is.</i>

37
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,166
<i>She's taken back
her dad's company.</i>

38
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,876
<i>Now she's using
the Pym Particle</i>

39
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,086
<i>for global change.</i>

40
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,506
<i>A lot of people say they want
to save the world,</i>

41
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,466
<i>but Hope,
she saves it everyday.</i>

42
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,260
Thank you.

43
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,429
Thank you so much.

44
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,306
<i>Reforestation.
Affordable housing.</i>

45
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,516
<i>Food production.</i>

46
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,268
<i>She's not wasting a second.</i>

47
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,526
<i>I still can't believe it.</i>

48
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,028
<i>None of this
should have happened.</i>

49
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,196
<i>But it did.</i>

50
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:42,825
<i>It's a pretty good world.</i>

51
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,702
<i>I'm glad we saved it.</i>

52
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:47,538
"Do I miss the action?

53
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,249
"Sometimes."

54
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,376
"Will I be there
when the Avengers need me?

55
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,502
"Absolutely.

56
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,421
"I'd never turn my back
on them.

57
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,425
"But right now, the only job
I want is being a dad.

58
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,011
"I love you, Cassie.

59
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,680
"Thanks for being my hero.

60
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,267
"And I'm sorry
I missed some birthdays."

of you kids out there,

"there's always room to grow."

68
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,251
Sorry, that's me.

69
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,421
Why is jail calling?

70
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:39,965
Lang!

71
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,843
- Lang!
- I'm here.

72
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,428
All right, come on. Let's go.

73
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,556
Come on.

74
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,979
Hey. Is she okay?
Have you heard anything?

75
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:55,814
Not yet. No. Oh.

76
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:57,566
Hi, Hope.
Hey, Dad.

77
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,527
Cassie. What happened?

78
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,694
Sign here.

79
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,697
Oh, you know, just jail stuff.

80
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,491
Give it back.

81
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,910
- Hmm?
- I know it was you.

82
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,078
Are you sure?

83
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:10,454
I mean, it was
kind of hard to see

84
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,122
through all that tear gas
you fired into the park

85
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,499
full of peaceful protestors.

86
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,792
Where is it?

87
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,627
I'm sorry. This must be
really embarrassing for you.

88
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,172
Oh!

89
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:21,799
I did find this though.

90
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,681
You shrank a cop car?

91
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:29,932
What were you thinking?

92
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,642
What was I supposed to do?
Look the other way?

93
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,018
They were clearing out
a homeless camp

94
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,853
- in the middle of the night.
- No, I'm not saying that...

95
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:35,938
And where do
they expect them to go?

96
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,815
It's not their fault that they
lost their homes in the Blip.

97
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:38,899
I... I know that.

98
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,150
No one can even
afford rent right now,

99
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,027
unless you're
some trust-fund asshole.

100
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,279
I'm not telling you
what to do.

101
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,822
- I'm just saying...
- Telling her what to do.

102
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,240
Telling me exactly what to do.

103
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:47,950
No, you do what you want.

104
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,660
I'm suggesting
another way to do it.

105
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:50,995
Okay.

106
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,454
You know,
I promised your mom

107
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,706
that you would
only use this stuff

108
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,082
when one of us was around.

109
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,333
It's really dangerous tech.

110
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,751
I know it's dangerous.

111
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,128
What if the cops
took it from you? Huh?

112
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,212
What if you lost it?

113
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:01,297
I didn't lose the suit.

114
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,716
You have a suit?
Wait, you have a suit?

115
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,342
I know how to
take care of myself, okay?

116
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,303
Trust me.
I'm pretty good at it by now.

117
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:09,513
Ouch.

118
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,309
- I didn't mean it like that.
- I know.

119
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,019
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay. It's all right.

120
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,270
I get it.

121
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,981
I just think you should get
to have a normal life.

122
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:21,025
Dad, a guy dressed like a bee

123
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,985
tried to kill me in my room
when I was six.

124
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,613
I've never had a normal life.

125
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,407
How about some music?

126
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,075
<i>"And in that moment,</i>

127
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,160
<i>"all I could think was,</i>

128
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,537
<i>"How did the Hulk
turn me into a baby?</i>

129
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,539
<i>"Will I be a baby forever?</i>

130
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:36,957
<i>"Am I the Hulk's baby?"</i>

131
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,834
Dad, are you listening
to your own book?

132
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:39,918
<i>"But I was ready
for anything."</i>

133
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,004
Hmm? No, that's, uh...
It's just the radio.

134
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,088
<i>"Steve and I
grew close over that."</i>

135
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,757
- Dad, turn it off.
- It's so weird.

136
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,759
Something's wrong with this
switch. It won't turn <i>off.</i>

137
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:47,926
I said turn it off.

138
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,219
What's that? Turn it up?
All right.

139
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,429
<i>"A little after that,</i>

140
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,097

143
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,481
- Mm.
- Excuse me.

00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,857
- Oh.
- Thank you.

145
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,983
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

146
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,235
All right.

147
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,405
Your Nobel Prize
is in the mail.

148
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,116
It better be.
I just saved eight bucks.

149
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,243
God, I admire you.

150
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:14,620
Thank you.

151
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:17,414
I missed this.

152
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,249
No pizza in the Quantum Realm?

153
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,419
No. No anything.

154
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,838
You know, Mom,
you can talk about it.

155
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:26,382
If you want.

156
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,551
Sweetheart, I spent
30 years down there.

157
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,138
I wanna live right now.

158
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,015
Yep.

159
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,936
So, Cassie, did you make
any new friends

160
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,396
in the slammer this time?

161
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,647
Grandpa.

162
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:43,107
"This time"?

163
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:44,817
Was there a last time?

164
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,819
I mean,
last time barely counts.

165
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:48,904
I didn't know that.

166
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,072
Why didn't you call me?

167
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,407
'Cause I knew
you'd be like this.

168
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,409
I would've just broken you out
with ants.

169
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:54,910
All right, you know what?
Family meeting.

170
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,078
Can we have a family meeting?

171
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,246
Isn't that what we're doing?

172
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,372
Yeah, I mean about this.

173
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,416
About everybody
being so fine with this.

174
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,420
Look, you wanna help.
I get it.

175
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,171
I do, Cassie. I really do.

176
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,506
But I don't want you
wasting your life.

177
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,800
At least I'm still trying
to do something with mine.

178
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,971
I literally saved the world.

179
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,097
Oh, did you?

180
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,890
Well, yeah, you never
mentioned that before.

181
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,684
Hey, everybody,
Scott saved the world.

182
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,018
How was that for you, Scott?

183
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,478
You should write a book
about it.

184
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,063
Ha ha. Hilarious.

185
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,107
Yeah, you're welcome
for all not being dust.

186
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:26,734
And what do you do now?

187
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:29,903
Sign books?

188
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,906
Aren't you the guy
who broke into VistaCorp?

189
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,867
Aren't you the guy who flew
all the way to Germany

190
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,910
just to fight Captain America
at the airport?

191
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,246
Fight with Captain America
at the airport.

192
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,999
Wouldn't fight
Captain America.

193
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,167
Not insane.

194
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,461
People still need help, Dad.

195
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,256
At least we're trying
to do something that matters.

196
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,802
Who's "we"?

197
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,930
Hmm?
What are you three up to?

198
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,016
Science.

199
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,394
With ants.

200
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,563
Ant science.

201
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,107
I don't believe you.

202
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,194
Let's just show him.

203
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,824
Whoa.
What are they building?

204
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,117
Are you doing this?

205
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,496
Actually, no,
they built their own tech.

206
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,122
Pretty smart ants.

207
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,041
Okay, so when you were all,

208
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,211
like, gone those five years,
I had a lot of time.

209
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,671
And I started reading
Grandpa Hank's old journals,

210
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,882
and I got really into
the Quantum Realm and...

211
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,675
Whoa. The Quantum Realm?

212
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,886
I know we all
have a history there,

213
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:36,970
and I didn't want
to freak anyone out,

214
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,263
but we've been talking
about it.

215
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,932
She had some questions, okay?

216
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:43,185
I can't help if people
are inspired by me.

217
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:48,357
So, you've been studying
the Quantum Realm?

218
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,067
Mm-hmm.

219
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,276
Why didn't you
ask me about it?

220
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,529
I tried, Mom.

221
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:54,822
A lot.

222
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,657
You never wanted
to talk about it.

223
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,075
Cassie's just been curious

224
00:10:58,242 --> 00:10:59,910
and we gave her some pointers.

225
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:03,705
This isn't exactly
ant science, is it, Henry?

226
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,875
You know how dangerous
the Quantum Realm is.

227
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,960
Yeah, we all do, Mom.

228
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,586
Nobody's going
to the Quantum Realm.

229
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,588
That's why we made this.

230
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:15,133
It's like a satellite
for deep space or the ocean.

231
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,845
But...

232
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,221
...Quantum.

233
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,850
We just need a map.

234
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,852
And then we can study
and explore

235
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,436
the entire Quantum Realm.

236
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:29,356
Never even have to go.

237
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:33,110
Your daughter built
a subatomic Hubble Telescope

238
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,403
in a basement.

239
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,615
You know,
if I had something like this

240
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:39,867
when you were gone...

241
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,204
then I could have found you.

242
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,709
It's amazing.

243
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,961
I'm blown away.

244
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,673
How does it work?

245
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,801
It's kinda like that
two-way radio we used to have.

246
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,887
You send a signal down
from here,

247
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,805
and then it collects the data,
and it sends it back.

248
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,140
Wait. Wait a minute.

249
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:07,102
You're sending a signal
down to the Quantum Realm?

250
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:09,813
Yeah.

251
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,274
- Shut it down now.
- Janet...

252
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,067
- Why would we shut it...
- What's wrong?

253
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,402
You have to turn it off!

254
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,029
Stop and tell us what's wrong!

255
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,783
Janet?

256
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,497
There's something
I should have told...

257
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,159
Dad?

258
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,578
No!

259
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,372
- No!
- Mom!

260
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,165
No!

261
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,542
Damn it!

262
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,338
Dad?

263
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,496
Dad!

264
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:55,711
Dad!

265
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:21,903
Cassie.

266
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,452
Dad!

267
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:29,411
Oh, Dad.

268
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:30,871
Come on.

269
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,539
Okay.

270
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:33,623
Are you okay?

271
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:34,833
Yeah. I'm okay.

272
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,309
Where are we?

273
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,411
Mom!

274
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,039
Dad!

275
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:15,916
Hope. Over here.

276
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,586
Are you okay?

277
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,005
We should be dead.

278
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,007
Why aren't we?

279
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,383
I don't know.

280
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,929
Are we where I think we are?

281
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,306
I would say yes,

282
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,975
but, uh, it wasn't like this.

283
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,185
Janet!

284
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,603
Mom!

285
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:38,730
Janet!

286
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,399
Mom!

287
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,622
Do not move.

288
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,684
We need to find
Scott and Cassie.

289
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:17,894
Right now.

290
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,732
<i>Hope?</i>

291
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:23,859
<i>Hope?</i>

292
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,944
<i>Hank? Can you hear me?</i>

293
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,531
- <i>Can anyone hear me?</i>
- Oh, my God.

294
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,075
- It's okay.
- What are we gonna do?

295
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,035
It's okay. It's okay.
We're okay.

296
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,245
We're okay.
It's gonna be okay.

297
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,496
You're saying "okay" too much.

298
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,832
Okay. All right. Okay.
Well, it's 'cause we are.

299
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,959
We're okay.
We are fine.

300
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,210
Hey, we're gonna find them,

301
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:43,587
- and we're gonna go home.
- Mm.

302
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,839
In the meantime, look around.

303
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,215
It's beautiful.

304
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,633
All right? We're outside.

305
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,511
It's like we're camping.
We love camping.

306
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,846
We've never been camping.

307
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,682
But we've always
talked about it.

308
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,230
Is that sun moving?

309
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,201
Get back!

310
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,831
Oh, my God.

311
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,417
I don't think this is a sun!

312
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,461
It's fine.

313
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,463
- Dad!
- Honey, it's okay.

314
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,631
Still okay.

315
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,933
Dad. Oh, my God.

316
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,100
That was weird.

317
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,482
Run.

318
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,389
There's Quantum people
in the Quantum Realm?

319
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,556
Yeah.

320
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,809
I didn't know that either.

321
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,314
What was that back there, Mom?

322
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,108
What was that ship
looking for?

323
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,985
Keep your voice down.

324
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,237
You said there was nothing
down here.

325
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:33,738
Why didn't you tell us
about all of this?

326
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,365
Hope, I will explain
everything, but right now,

327
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,534
- I just need you to trust me.
- Then make me trust you!

328
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,160
Let's just calm down,
all right?

329
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:40,245
We can talk about this...

330
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,497
We don't have time
to talk, Henry.

331
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:43,957
No, you need
to tell us what's...

332
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,041
And why didn't you listen?

333
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,418
I told you
to stay away from here.

334
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,337
Janet, I... I'm so sorry.

335
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,506
I should have told you
what we were doing.

336
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:52,799
I had no idea...

337
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:53,967
I know. It's...

338
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,303
We'll talk later.

339
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,263
Right now, we stick together,

340
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,598
we find Scott and Cassie,

341
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,851
and we go home. Okay?

342
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,352
- Okay?
- Okay?

343
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,520
- Okay.
- Okay.

344
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,688
Stay close.

345
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,447
This is incredible.

346
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,450
I've studied
the Quantum Realm for years.

347
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:21,995
Why didn't I see any of this?

348
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,539
You weren't able
to look deep enough.

349
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,167
Not through
the Void and Sub-Atomica.

350
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,253
There are worlds here,

351
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,130
worlds within worlds.

352
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,885
It's a place
outside time and space.

353
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,847
It's a secret universe

354
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,766
beneath ours.

355
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,872
Hey, get your hands off me!

356
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:13,838
Cassie?

357
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,634
Where's my daughter?

358
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:20,804
Where is she?

359
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:22,889
Cassie?

360
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:27,852
Where's my daughter?

361
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,482
Cassie!

362
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,152
Dad!

363
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:37,987
Cassie!

364
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,115
Drink the ooze.

365
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,534
What?

366
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,849
I'll handle this.

367
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,406
Mom.

368
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:51,406
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

369
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,128
Was that a... a good stab?

370
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:19,047
I got us a ride.

371
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,400
He's friendly.

372
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,402
Quite a ride.

373
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,489
Says the man who invented
flying on the back of an ant.

374
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:45,573
I like ants.

375
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,034
And I love that you love them.
Here.

376
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,079
These will help us blend in.

377
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,749
Where exactly
are we going on this?

378
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,668
We're not too far
from an old friend of mine.

379
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,711
If anyone's heard
where Scott and Cassie are,

380
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:00,797
it'll be him.

381
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:02,674
After you.

382
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,802
Saddle up, Ant-Man.

383
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,268
Let me go! Let me go!

384
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:25,947
I don't know
what you're saying!

385
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,907
I don't know what you...

386
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,844
No! No!

387
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,063
Drink the ooze!

388
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,565
Drink the ooze!

389
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,609
Drink the ooze!

390
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,110
Drink the ooze!

391
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:06,863
- Hello.
- Whoa!

392
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,031
Hi. Hi.

393
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,449
Did you drink the ooze?

394
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,327
Why can I understand you?

395
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,661
Oh. Great. That's the ooze.

396
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,663
Hey, everybody, it worked!
Ooze worked!

397
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,835
We can finally be friends.

398
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,170
Hi. I am Veb.

399
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,296
You just drank me.

400
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:24,464
I did... What?

401
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:25,965
Oh. Do you need
some more ooze? Here.

402
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,050
I can pour some ooze
into your hole...

403
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,134
No, I'm okay.

404
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,761
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Oh, wow!

405
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,346
A big hole.

406
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,181
How many holes do you have?

407
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,183
I'm sorry.
Is that a personal question?

408
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,018
I don't have any holes.

409
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,103
His name is Scott Lang.

410
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,522
He has seven holes.

411
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:47,570
Yeah, that's right.

412
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,489
How did you...
How did you know that?

413
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,658
He's Quaz. He's a telepath.

414
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,036
You can read minds?

415
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:58,289
Yeah, and I really wish
I couldn't.

416
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:01,417
Everyone is disgusting.

417
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,252
Hmm.

418
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:04,712
Could you please
stop thinking that?

419
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:06,130
Sorry.

420
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:07,632
- Please, stop.
- Thinking?

421
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,134
- Thinking that.
- I'm trying.

422
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:11,886
Well, not very hard.

423
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,554
And I think
you look weird too.

424
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:15,306
I don't think you look weird.
I think you look really cool.

425
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,599
I wish my head glowed.

426
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:18,810
No, no, you don't.

427
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,311
I know I don't. I just...
I'm nervous, okay?

428
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:21,396
And it just came out.

429
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,480
What are you doing here?

430
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,440
- Are you a spy?
- What? No. No, no.

431
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:25,650
We should torture him.

432
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:26,734
Guys. No, it's okay.

433
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:29,487
We're not... We're not spies.
He's my dad.

434
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,072
Oh!

435
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,407
Oh... Thank you.

436
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,491
Welcome.

437
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:37,203
Then who is San Francisco?

438
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,913
- It's where we're from.
- It's a place.

439
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,040
- Then what's Earth?
- It's also where we're from.

440
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,208
We should torture them.

441
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,501
Why are you always
trying to torture people?

442
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:44,585
We have other options.

443
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,170
Do things come out
of your holes,

444
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:47,547
like milk, juice...

445
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,091
Veb, stop asking
about his holes.

446
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,300
Some of us have holes.

447
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,885
What are you doing here?

448
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,679
Where are you from?

449
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,764
- Okay.
- Up there. Up there.

450
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:57,974
- See, above this...
- The Earth.

451
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,726
- ...it's a different universe.
- Big Earth.

452
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:00,893
It's the same universe,
but it's bigger.

453
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,186
This is Earth,
but it's a very small Earth.

454
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,730
- Sometimes, I guess.
- I get big. I shrink.

455
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:04,814
And it's like...

456
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,065
But I wrote a book about it,
actually.

457
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,233
- I don't know.
- This is the Quantum Realm.

458
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,443
You have to shrink to
get in the Quantum Realm.

459
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:09,527
We shrunk.
Right now, we're really small.

460
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,611
It's bigger where we're from.

461
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,405
- So, we're small right now.
- It's bigger.

462
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,077
Okay, they're telling
the truth.

463
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:19,287
It doesn't matter.

464
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,916
You come from above.

465
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:26,169
Like him.

466
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:30,298
So, he is hunting you.

467
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,593
He will burn the world
to find you.

468
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,511
Who?

469
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,431
The Conqueror.

470
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:42,829
There are beings
down here.

471
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,914
Intelligent beings.

472
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:48,042
I always theorized it was
possible, but to be here,

473
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,295
a subatomic universe.

474
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,923
This changes everything
we know about life,

475
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,509
evolution,
our place in the galaxy...

476
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,386
Holy shit!

477
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,429
That guy looks like broccoli.

478
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,148
Keep your head down.

479
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:04,285
Follow me.

480
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:18,716
Drink those.

481
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:20,760
I'll be right back.

482
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:36,400
I'm here for Krylar.

483
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:39,946
Oh.

484
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,365
It's... It's you.

485
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:43,866
Let's keep that between us.

486
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,494
And Krylar.

487
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:47,662
Hello.

488
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,623
I don't know
your ways or customs,

489
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,875
but I assume
that you have a beverage

490
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,335
that can get me drunk?

491
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:55,544
Absolutely, sir.

492
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:00,925
Hmm.
So, what's your story then?

493
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:03,386
God.

494
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:05,930
Move.

495
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,348
It's time.

496
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,891
Follow me.

497
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:16,857
Right this way.

498
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:20,528
- Hmm.
- Oh.

499
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,865
How exactly
do you know this guy?

500
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:28,202
Old, uh, freedom fighter
friend of mine.

501
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:30,371
Sorry, you were
a freedom fighter?

502
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:31,580
Or terrorist.

503
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,791
Depends on who you ask.

504
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:37,294
But, trust me, he can help.

505
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,964
Janet Van Dyne?

506
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:25,509
I thought you were dead.

507
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:28,012
Been a long time, Krylar.

508
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:31,432
Officially, Lord Krylar now.

509
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,934
I fought like hell
against that.

510
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,103
It sounds so elitist.

511
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:40,441
You have got to be Hank.

512
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:43,944
I've heard so much
about you and your ants.

513
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,280
What are ants anyway?

514
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:47,823
Do we have 'em down here?

515
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,617
I don't think so. No.

516
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,786
Oh. That's too bad.

517
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:53,996
Hope.

518
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,415
You have to be Hope.

519
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,210
She talked about you
every day.

520
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,711
That's strange,

521
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:03,047
she never said
anything about you.

522
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,635
I don't think I would have
told my kid either.

523
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:10,179
- Wild stuff.
- Funny.

524
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,847
- Hmm.
- How wild?

525
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:15,434
Very wild, Henry. Yeah.

526
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,019
Uh...

527
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:20,106
Krylar, we need your help.

528
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:24,235
Janet, after all
we've been through, together,

529
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:25,528
just ask me.

530
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,154
Tell me, how can I help?

531
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:28,614
But...

532
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:31,826
is anyone starving?
I'm starving.

533
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,119
Boys...

534
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,329
Now.

535
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:44,255
They don't know anything.

536
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,508
About... anything.

537
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:48,676
Then get them
out of here.

538
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,637
Excuse me.

539
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,973
Look, he's right.
I don't know what's going on.

540
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,516
We're just trying
to find our family.

541
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:56,809
Do you have a map?

542
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,978
All we wanna do is go... Whoa!

543
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,273
Wait, wait. Don't shoot.

544
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,566
They're with us.

545
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:06,861
Is that building alive?

546
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:08,612
Yours are dead?

547
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:13,200
Look. Excuse me.

548
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:14,785
We just wanna go home.

549
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:21,041
At least you still
have a home.

550
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,342
What happened here?

551
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,637
The Conqueror
burned our homes.

552
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:36,056
Our stories.

553
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:40,311
He built his citadel
on the bones of our people.

554
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:42,980
Some of us escaped,

555
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:44,899
found others on the run.

556
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,526
We gathered
who we could to fight.

557
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,778
It was never enough.

558
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,281
I'm sorry.

559
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:54,158
We can help.

560
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:02,124
- Uh, Cassie...
- Dad, you're an Avenger.

561
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,209
They need help.

562
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,336
No. What I need to do
is get you home.

563
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:06,962
Why don't you wanna help?

564
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,339
We don't know anything
about this place.

565
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,216
I mean, I don't even know
how time works down here.

566
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,550
Have we been gone
for 10 seconds?

567
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:12,718
Or have we been gone
for 10 years?

568
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,011
Think about your mom
right now.

569
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,137
Can you imagine
what she must be...

570
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,347
Don't use Mom as an excuse.

571
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,599
- You just don't care.
- No, I do care.

572
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:20,434
I know you wanna help. I do.

573
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,394
But this is not our fight.

574
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,104
Just 'cause it's not
happening to you,

575
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,439
doesn't mean
it's not happening.

576
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:27,942
Hey.

577
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:32,279
Would you look at me?

578
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,075
She's disappointed in you.

579
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:38,702
- I got that. Yeah. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

580
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:39,954
We'll talk about it later.

581
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,789
Right now,
let's just find the others.

582
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,208
No one knows this place
better than Janet.

583
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:47,503
What did you say?

584
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,088
What?

585
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:50,464
That name.

586
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,133
Janet Van Dyne.

587
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:54,218
Where is she?

588
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,178
That's what we're trying
to find out. You know her?

589
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,888
I know her.

590
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:00,474
She shouldn't be here.

591
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,228
Hey, bring a round
of the chasers, please.

592
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:05,938
Yes, thank you.

593
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:09,191
If you haven't had this,
don't try it

594
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:11,777
unless you want
to change your life.

595
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:22,997
Mmm.

596
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,583
Krylar, we're looking
for friends of ours.

597
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:28,836
Two of them.

598
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:30,296
Human, like us.

599
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,089
Human, that's the word.

600
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:35,342
Totally forgot what you call
yourselves up there.

601
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:36,510
Human.

602
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,179
Are you not human?

603
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,348
Not technically, but yes.

604
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:43,350
In the ways that matter.

605
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,981
No!

606
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:53,861
Let us talk.

607
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:01,076
So, what is it that brings you
to us, Janet?

608
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,913
If I remember correctly,
you left.

609
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:08,375
You left all of us.

610
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:10,252
With him.

611
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,756
Janet, what is
he talking about?

612
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:18,552
You didn't tell them
about him.

613
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,098
Did you say anything

614
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,225
about what you did here?

615
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,730
How many people died
because of you?

616
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:37,154
Does your family even know
who you are?

617
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:41,992
Your mommy

618
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,287
is full of secrets.

619
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:46,538
You're lying.

620
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:47,831
I lie.

621
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,167
A lot.

622
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,588
Not about this.

623
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:57,674
Let them go.

624
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:01,470
He just wants me.

625
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:03,013
But you want them.

626
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,974
So they're coming too.

627
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:10,270
Along with those
other friends of yours.

628
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:13,524
I heard about them.

629
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,901
But he did too.

630
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:19,321
And, uh, he sent the Hunter.

631
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,490
What kind of hunter?

632
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,868
Uh, not a man.
Not a machine.

633
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:28,914
A mechanized organism
designed only

634
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,749
for killing.

635
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,211
Where are they?

636
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:35,671
No clue.

637
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:37,923
Dead.

638
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,510
Probably dead.

639
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:58,026
Oh, this is so sad
when all of this

640
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,736
could have been avoided,
Janet.

641
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:03,031
Just give him what he wants.

642
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:07,703
What happened to you?

643
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:13,500
We fought against him.

644
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:17,463
He can be very persuasive.

645
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,049
Let's pay him a visit.

646
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:26,513
I think we're done here.

647
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:45,741
Can that ship
get us out of here?

648
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:50,454
- Cover me?
- Always.

649
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,487
Henry, take the helm.

650
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:25,656
I'm gonna hot-wire this thing.

651
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:31,370
Where are the controls?

652
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,121
Those are the controls.

653
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,001
What the hell?

654
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:40,045
You'll be great.
It's like flying a bike.

655
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:44,383
Is the bike alive?

656
00:39:57,938 --> 00:39:59,982
Hands, all the way in!

657
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:01,733
Like stuffing a turkey.

658
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,068
Ugh.

659
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,660
- Really, him?
- He used to be charming.

660
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,744
That guy?

661
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:14,746
I was down here
for 30 years, Henry.

662
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,623
- I had needs.
- Oh, my God.

663
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,584
Look, I get it.
I've got needs too.

664
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,751
Oh, my God!

665
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,004
I had dinner with someone
a few times.

666
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:24,047
Her name was Linda.

667
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:26,008
It didn't work out.

668
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,426
What went wrong?

669
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,469
She wasn't you, baby.

670
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:34,766
Get everyone in the ships.
We're leaving.

671
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:35,851
All right.

672
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,728
- And, Xolum.
- Right here.

673
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,105
Take them as far away
from here as you can.

674
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:41,315
- Why?
- What?

675
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:44,651
If you're looking for Janet,
he's looking for you.

676
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,870
You led them straight to us.

677
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,747
Come on, come on.

678
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:58,832
Take as many as you can.

679
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:00,167
We'll hold them off.

680
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,441
Go!

681
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:27,486
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

682
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,613
We gotta go! We gotta go!

683
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,906
Get on. Get on now!

684
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,240
We have to go now. Now!

685
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,218
Oh, my God!

686
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,320
Cassie, let's go!

687
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:18,829
Get to the sanctuary.

688
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:20,664
Wait for my message.

689
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:23,083
- Veb, we're leaving.
- No. No, wait!

690
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,293
- Move! Move!
- All my friends.

691
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:48,692
<i>Give up the travelers.</i>

692
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:50,235
<i>The Conqueror
will show you mercy.</i>

693
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,778
I know his mercy.

694
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,418
Stay here. I'm...

695
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:08,670
Cassie?

696
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,381
Oh, no.

697
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,031
Okay. I have a suit.

698
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:37,949
Yeah, I noticed.

699
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:39,993
- You okay?
- Yes.

700
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,079
Look, momentum, right?

701
00:43:43,163 --> 00:43:45,165
Jump, tap, right?
One move. Jump, tap.

702
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:46,333
I know how to do it, Dad.

703
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,584
- Oh, do you? Really?
- Yes.

704
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:48,919
'Cause it didn't look like it
from my end.

705
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:50,295
I just... I messed up
on the timing.

706
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,088
Jump...

707
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:57,886
Like that.

708
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,387
You see what I did?
You see what I did?

709
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,598
No. You're like this small.

710
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,266
I jumped and tapped.

711
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,195
Jentorra, we have to go.

712
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:37,509
Get to the ship!

713
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,349
<i>Welcome back</i>

714
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:28,184
<i>to the Quantum Realm, Scott.</i>

715
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,521
<i>I've been waiting
a long time forth is.</i>

716
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,315
What?

717
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:36,026
Is someone in there?

718
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:38,153
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

719
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,906
<i>The destiny you cannot escape.</i>

720
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:44,200
<i>Our fates have always
been forged together...</i>

721
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,204
<i>ever since that day we met.</i>

722
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,707
Wow.

723
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,208
Scott Lang.

724
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,460
Get away from us!

725
00:45:53,627 --> 00:45:55,128
<i>The day you broke me.</i>

726
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,216
- <i>Banished me down here.</i>
<i>- Wait.</i>

727
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:03,553
Darren?

728
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:06,848
Surprised to see me?

729
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:09,851
Yeah.

730
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:11,519
It's the bee guy?

731
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,438
- It's the bee guy?
- Cassie?

732
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,190
I almost didn't recognize you.

733
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,734
How are you not dead?

734
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:19,819
I became the ultimate weapon.

735
00:46:21,071 --> 00:46:23,114
That... That...
That's what this is?

736
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:25,241
Look, Darren.

737
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:30,705
Darren is dead!

738
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,376
There is only M.O.D.O.K.!

739
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,545
And there's no place
you can run, Scott.

740
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:38,838
Not from me.

741
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:41,091
And not from him.

742
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,302
He's the future.

743
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:46,179
He's the past.

744
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,225
And now all he needs is you.

745
00:46:56,523 --> 00:46:57,649
Mom?

746
00:46:58,108 --> 00:46:59,818
What's after Scott and Cassie?

747
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:03,154
We have to find them.

748
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:05,949
There's something
I have to do first.

749
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:07,534
They could be dead!

750
00:47:07,701 --> 00:47:09,160
Hope, please.

751
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:10,954
And you're still
hiding things from us.

752
00:47:11,121 --> 00:47:13,415
I am trying to protect you.

753
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:15,000
From what?

754
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,504
Who are you so afraid of?

755
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,435
Third time in jail?

756
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:36,604
Four.

757
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:47,407
<i>And here we are again.</i>

758
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,035
Face to face.

759
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,039
That's a face. It's a...

760
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:56,666
It's a big face.

761
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:58,418
Why are you
just a floating head?

762
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:00,670
Maybe you could
walk us through this, Darren.

763
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:03,757
You left Darren to die
in the Quantum Realm.

764
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,385
<i>But the Conqueror found me.</i>

765
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:09,095
<i>Rebuilt me.</i>

766
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:11,890
<i>Made me the ultimate weapon.</i>

767
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:14,851
<i>A mechanized organism
designed only for...</i>

768
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:15,935
Oh, M.O.D.O.K.?

769
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:20,356
Oh, uh, MO... Oh, I get it.
It's an acronym.

770
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:21,691
It's an acronym.

771
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:24,861
Mechanized organism
designed only for killing.

772
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:27,906
Actually, that's M.O.D.O.F.K.

773
00:48:28,073 --> 00:48:30,075
I bet you thought
you'd seen the last of me.

774
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:31,493
Just now noticing
the baby legs.

775
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,244
They're not baby legs.

776
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,788
A little bit like a Björn.

777
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:36,289
You think you're so smart.

778
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:39,584
Scott Lang, the man
who took everything from me.

779
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:41,169
Who stole my whole life.

780
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:42,420
But I did it.

781
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,590
I got you here.

782
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:47,759
I found your signal, Cassie.

783
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:49,135
Thanks for that, by the way.

784
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:50,512
Couldn't have done it
without you.

785
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:55,767
You're looking
at a man set free.

786
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:58,770
I've created so much more here

787
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,438
than you could
possibly imagine.

788
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:04,234
All for him.

789
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:10,073
I wasn't the only one stranded
in the Quantum Realm.

790
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,745
What is this place?

791
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,331
<i>He said
he was a traveler.</i>

792
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:21,543
A scientist
who crashed <i>off</i> course.

793
00:49:29,259 --> 00:49:30,718
<i>He had a ship</i>

794
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:34,264
beyond anything
I had ever seen.

795
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:37,976
<i>A ship that could travel
the Multiverse.</i>

796
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:39,352
The Multiverse?

797
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:42,897
As in alternate dimensions?

798
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,899
Parallel realities?

799
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:46,693
I didn't believe it at first.

800
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:49,904
But it's real.

801
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:53,116
<i>Just like we theorized.</i>

802
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,370
Can this take us home?

803
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,748
It can take you anywhere.

804
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:08,673
Yah!

805
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,811
<i>I'd never met
anyone like him.</i>

806
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:26,316
<i>He felt so</i>

807
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:27,817
<i>lost.</i>

808
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:30,737
<i>I guess we both were.</i>

809
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,072
<i>But we had a way out.</i>

810
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,452
<i>We tried everything</i>

811
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:40,413
<i>to recharge
his ship's energy core.</i>

812
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:47,587
<i>Nothing worked.</i>

813
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:53,801
<i>But after so many years alone,
it was nice to have a friend.</i>

814
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:56,512
I lied to Hope.

815
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:02,727
I told her I was coming home.

816
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:08,733
I can see her by the door.

817
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:12,654
Waiting for me.

818
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,201
That's the last thing I did...

819
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,038
was lie to her.

820
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,877
I just thought
I'd have more time.

821
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:34,175
I can give that to you.

822
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,178
Time.

823
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:42,433
It's not what you think it is.

824
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:48,147
It's a cage.

825
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,317
And it does everything it can

826
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:53,069
to break you.

827
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:59,534
It's not until you free
yourself from it that you see

828
00:52:00,702 --> 00:52:02,120
just how small

829
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:04,330
it always was.

830
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:12,005
We're going
to get out of here.

831
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:17,176
She's gonna open the door...

832
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:19,804
...and you'll be there.

833
00:52:24,434 --> 00:52:25,601
I promise.

834
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:32,025
- Let's get to work.
- Okay.

835
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:37,322
<i>It took ages,
but we did it.</i>

836
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:42,035
We brought it back to life.

837
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:45,663
Let's go home.

838
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,086
<i>His ship was neurokinetic.</i>

839
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:54,714
<i>Connected to his thoughts.</i>

840
00:52:58,634 --> 00:52:59,677
<i>When I touched it...</i>

841
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:03,306
I saw his mind.

842
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:05,683
<i>I felt...</i>

843
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:08,853
<i>...what he had done.</i>

844
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,484
<i>Entire worlds,</i>

845
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:17,362
<i>entire timelines.</i>

846
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:21,199
<i>Gone, like they
never even existed.</i>

847
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,968
Janet?

848
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:46,974
We can leave.

849
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:50,186
Right now.

850
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:56,818
Who is Kang?

851
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,574
Who I need to be.

852
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,247
He didn't crash here.

853
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:11,457
He was exiled here.

854
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:15,711
Outside space and time.

855
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:18,548
The only place

856
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:21,092
that could hold him.

857
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:23,594
Exiled?

858
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:25,721
By who?

859
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:27,098
I don't know.

860
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,394
But they sabotaged his ship.

861
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:34,439
And trapped him here.

862
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,276
And because of me,

863
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:41,070
he was getting out.

864
00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:42,363
Janet?

865
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:46,409
Stay away.

866
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,708
You saved my life.

867
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,381
I made a promise.

868
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:08,973
Just let me take you home.

869
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:11,809
And then?

870
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:15,730
What are you going to do?

871
00:55:27,116 --> 00:55:28,367
Win.

872
00:55:46,636 --> 00:55:50,181
I told you
time isn't what you think.

873
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:53,976
I can make it...

874
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:56,854
so you never left her.

875
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:01,400
Hope is going
to open the door

876
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,153
and you'll be there.

877
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:07,490
And how many worlds
will die...

878
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,576
if you get out?

879
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:13,162
Not yours.

880
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:16,541
She'll never know.

881
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,839
Don't you want
to see your daughter again?

882
00:56:26,175 --> 00:56:27,718
I can't let you leave.

883
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:32,181
Why do you think
you can stop me?

884
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,534
Give it to me, Janet.

885
00:56:52,994 --> 00:56:54,120
Give it to me!

886
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:57,540
I couldn't beat him.
He was too powerful.

887
00:56:58,416 --> 00:56:59,417
What did you do?

888
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:05,423
I'm sorry, Hope.

889
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,968
No!

890
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:37,913
<i>I blew up his core.</i>

891
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,291
<i>Cut him off from time.</i>

892
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:43,628
<i>And trapped us both
down here forever.</i>

893
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,590
But I gave him back enough.

894
00:57:47,757 --> 00:57:49,383
Now that he had his suit back,

895
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,928
he became what he always was.

896
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,514
<i>A conqueror.</i>

897
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:58,267
<i>He's got weapons
and technology</i>

898
00:57:58,434 --> 00:58:02,104
<i>centuries beyond anything
we can dream of.</i>

899
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:06,734
<i>He took his prison
and made it his empire.</i>

900
00:58:07,777 --> 00:58:11,030
I spent years fighting him,

901
00:58:11,197 --> 00:58:13,783
running from him,
hiding from him.

902
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:16,911
And then you saved me.

903
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:21,248
You brought me home.

904
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,210
But I didn't deserve it.

905
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:29,590
I unleashed a monster
on this place

906
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:31,592
and ran away.

907
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:35,429
Janet, you couldn't
have known.

908
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:39,558
I'm sorry I never told you.

909
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:42,520
I just wanted to forget.

910
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,357
I just wanted
to be your mom again.

911
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:54,699
I'm so sorry you had to
go through all of that alone.

912
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:58,285
But you are not alone now.

913
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:03,374
We'll stop him together.

914
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:05,876
He's after the core.

915
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:09,380
But he needs Pym Particles
to reach it.

916
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:11,424
And if he's got
Scott and Cassie,

917
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:12,925
he's got Pym Particles.

918
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:14,927
- And a head start.
- Exactly.

919
00:59:15,094 --> 00:59:16,721
- We gotta get out of here.
- Hope.

920
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:18,889
He cannot get out.

921
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:41,912
You're an interesting man...

922
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:47,001
Scott Lang.

923
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:49,879
Um, I don't know who you are,

924
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:52,840
but you've made a big mistake.

925
00:59:53,466 --> 00:59:54,508
Okay?

926
00:59:55,468 --> 00:59:56,969
I'm an Avenger.

927
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,180
I've called
the other Avengers...

928
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:00,890
You're an Avenger?

929
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:05,060
Have I killed you before?

930
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,021
What?

931
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:09,774
They all blur together
after a while.

932
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:13,652
You're not the one
with the hammer?

933
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:15,154
No, that's Thor.

934
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,157
We get confused a lot.

935
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,493
Similar body types.
Who are you?

936
01:00:22,912 --> 01:00:24,038
Just a man

937
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,707
who's lost a lot of time.

938
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:28,042
Like you.

939
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:32,421
But we can help
each other with that.

940
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:36,425
M.O.D.O.K. tells me
you're a good thief.

941
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:38,886
Yeah, he stole something
from me.

942
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:42,848
Do not speak
when I am in the room.

943
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,275
Gotta say,
Janet was a lot more helpful.

944
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,277
You know Janet too?

945
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:58,781
Does everyone down here
know Janet?

946
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:01,700
She didn't tell you about me?

947
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:07,957
I guess that's not a surprise.

948
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,670
Janet stole something from me.

949
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:16,215
My ticket out of here.

950
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:21,846
And you're the only one
who can steal it back.

951
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:23,764
And why would I do that?

952
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:26,433
Because you want
to get out of here.

953
01:01:27,101 --> 01:01:31,188
And I need to get out of here.

954
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:35,359
Because I know how it ends.

955
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:37,236
How what ends?

956
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:41,949
All of it.

957
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:48,497
I don't live
in a straight line.

958
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,793
And with time,

959
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:54,879
it's hard

960
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:57,047
not to skip to the end.

961
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,010
So, if you want
to stop what's coming,

962
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:04,054
and trust me,

963
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:05,472
you do...

964
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:09,894
I am the only shot you have.

965
01:02:10,603 --> 01:02:11,729
What's coming?

966
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:14,857
Me.

967
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:19,403
A lot of me.

968
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:27,411
They exiled me, down here.

969
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,333
They're afraid of me.

970
01:02:38,297 --> 01:02:41,508
But I'm the man
who can get you home.

971
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:51,060
So,

972
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:53,395
do we have a deal?

973
01:02:56,774 --> 01:02:58,692
No, I don't think we do.

974
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:08,994
Dad!

975
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:11,497
Let me make this easy for you.

976
01:03:11,664 --> 01:03:13,374
You will bring me what I need

977
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,834
or I will kill your daughter
in front of you,

978
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:18,087
then make you
relive that moment

979
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:21,548
over and over
again in time, endlessly,

980
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:24,176
until you beg me to kill you.

981
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:26,845
Do we understand?

982
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:31,600
Don't do this.

983
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,606
I'm a man
who likes to be understood.

984
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:41,902
Dad.

985
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:44,279
Don't listen to him.

986
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:47,700
No! No!

987
01:03:47,783 --> 01:03:48,867
Look, we can talk about this.

988
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:50,452
Don't do it!

989
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:52,037
You really should do it.

990
01:03:52,121 --> 01:03:53,205
Please.

991
01:03:54,957 --> 01:03:57,126
That's my daughter, please.

992
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:59,753
Do you want her to live,
or do you want her to die?

993
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,921
Please!

994
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:02,297
You think I'm lying?

995
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,175
Do I look like a liar to you?

996
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:07,928
Stop!

997
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:09,596
- Dad!
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

998
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:11,306
I'll do it. Just let her go.

999
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:13,017
Let her go. Let her go!

1000
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,195
You're out of your league.

1001
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:28,240
Ant-Man.

1002
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:36,290
Just be glad I need you.

1003
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:52,973
Don't touch her again.

1004
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:55,017
Then give me what I need.

1005
01:04:56,769 --> 01:04:58,020
Where is it?

1006
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:40,979
What is that?

1007
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:43,524
It was a multiversal
engine core.

1008
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:46,610
A power source
that can take you

1009
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:48,654
anywhere in space and time.

1010
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:51,990
Then Janet blew it up.

1011
01:05:56,328 --> 01:05:57,663
It's in that?

1012
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,706
It is that.

1013
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,875
And we have to get
to the center.

1014
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:04,169
That's good to know.

1015
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:07,297
You'll have
to shrink down

1016
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:09,216
and pass through
the eye of the storm.

1017
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:12,010
Once you're inside,
find the core

1018
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,887
and size it back down.

1019
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:15,514
What does it look like?

1020
01:06:15,681 --> 01:06:16,765
When I steal something,

1021
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:17,975
I usually know
what I'm stealing.

1022
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:19,685
You'll know it
when you see it.

1023
01:06:19,852 --> 01:06:22,146
Get in and out
as fast as you can.

1024
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:23,605
The longer you're in there,

1025
01:06:23,689 --> 01:06:25,607
the more your mind
will come undone.

1026
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:29,486
Better hurry.

1027
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:31,947
Dad!

1028
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:35,909
I'm sorry.

1029
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:37,536
This is all my fault.

1030
01:06:38,245 --> 01:06:40,831
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1031
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:42,207
No.

1032
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:45,043
I messed up.

1033
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:46,545
Cassie.

1034
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,715
My whole life happened
because I messed up.

1035
01:06:51,175 --> 01:06:53,802
The only thing
I didn't mess up is you.

1036
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:58,182
Dad!

1037
01:06:58,891 --> 01:06:59,933
It's okay.

1038
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:01,143
It's okay.

1039
01:07:03,896 --> 01:07:05,355
I love you, Peanut.

1040
01:07:05,898 --> 01:07:08,400
I love you too.

1041
01:07:52,486 --> 01:07:54,154
Okay. I'm in.

1042
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,451
Darren, can you hear me?

1043
01:07:59,618 --> 01:08:00,619
Darren?

1044
01:08:01,495 --> 01:08:02,537
Darren?

1045
01:08:05,207 --> 01:08:07,000
M.O.D.O.K., can you hear me?

1046
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:08,252
<i>What?</i>

1047
01:08:08,627 --> 01:08:10,212
- I'm in.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1048
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:13,465
Okay, so what do I do?
What's the plan?

1049
01:08:14,967 --> 01:08:16,134
<i>Don't die?</i>

1050
01:08:17,386 --> 01:08:19,763
Thanks. Big help, M.O.D.O.K.

1051
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,765
<i>Do you see it?</i>

1052
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:23,725
Yeah. I see it.

1053
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:30,357
I'm heading in.

1054
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:32,734
Whoa!

1055
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:34,569
What the hell?

1056
01:08:34,653 --> 01:08:35,654
What the hell?

1057
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:36,738
What the hell?

1058
01:08:36,822 --> 01:08:37,864
<i>I told you, Scott.</i>

1059
01:08:37,948 --> 01:08:39,574
<i>Getting in
was just the beginning.</i>

1060
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:40,867
You never said that.

1061
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:42,286
Why am I looking
at another me?

1062
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:43,996
I'm not another me.
You're another me.

1063
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:45,163
You just came out...

1064
01:08:45,247 --> 01:08:46,873
Why am I looking
at another me?

1065
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,210
<i>You're looking at the
possibility of another you.</i>

1066
01:08:50,377 --> 01:08:52,129
<i>You're in a Probability Storm.</i>

1067
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:54,423
What does any of that mean?

1068
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:56,258
- You don't know?
- Why would I know?

1069
01:08:56,425 --> 01:08:57,426
Because you got me in here.

1070
01:08:57,509 --> 01:08:58,719
Oh, so,
I am the real one, huh?

1071
01:08:58,802 --> 01:08:59,803
No. I didn't say that.

1072
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:02,597
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

1073
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:03,765
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

1074
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:04,891
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- What the hell?

1075
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,101
What the hell?

1076
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:08,270
What is this place?

1077
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:10,439
<i>It's a Probability Storm.</i>

1078
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:13,442
<i>Every choice you could make,
existing all at once.</i>

1079
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:14,985
What is he saying?
What's he saying?

1080
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,069
What's he saying?

1081
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:17,612
<i>You're inside
Schrödinger's box.</i>

1082
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:18,780
<i>And you're the cat.</i>

1083
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:20,490
- That doesn't make sense.
- Oh, I get it.

1084
01:09:20,574 --> 01:09:22,284
Nobody move! All right?
Nobody move!

1085
01:09:22,451 --> 01:09:24,578
Why should we listen to you?
You're not even the real one.

1086
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:25,787
- What the hell?
- Am I real?

1087
01:09:25,871 --> 01:09:26,913
- Am I real?
- Am I real?

1088
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:28,290
- I am the real one!
- What the hell?

1089
01:09:28,457 --> 01:09:30,375
What the hell.
I'm the real one.

1090
01:09:30,459 --> 01:09:32,044
Whoa, whoa, guys. Hey, relax.

1091
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,879
Take it easy. Breathe.

1092
01:09:34,046 --> 01:09:36,131
We'll figure this out.
Together.

1093
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:37,299
Who are you?

1094
01:09:37,466 --> 01:09:38,842
Why are you dressed like that?

1095
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,303
Because I work
at Baskin-Robbins.

1096
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:43,221
This is my uniform.

1097
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:44,681
These are normal clothes.

1098
01:09:44,765 --> 01:09:46,099
Why are you dressed like that?

1099
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:48,935
- Do you have ice cream?
- Enough! Let's do this!

1100
01:09:57,152 --> 01:09:58,653
Oh, we're all gonna die.

1101
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:02,574
Wait. Whoa, whoa.

1102
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:03,867
Wait. Wait!

1103
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:05,118
No! No!

1104
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:07,746
<i>No! Wait! No!</i>

1105
01:10:07,913 --> 01:10:09,247
I've got a read on Scott.

1106
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:25,847
Out of the way!

1107
01:10:26,014 --> 01:10:28,100
- Mom! What is this?
- What are you doing?

1108
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:29,976
<i>Don't look at them.
They're just possibilities.</i>

1109
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:32,604
<i>They're not you.</i>

1110
01:10:32,938 --> 01:10:34,898
Scott, where are you?

1111
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,071
Why am I here?

1112
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:42,989
<i>Don't worry.
It'll work this time.</i>

1113
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:44,950
What are you...
Wait, wait, no, no. Stop.

1114
01:10:45,117 --> 01:10:47,619
- Stop! No!
- <i>I got this, guys.</i>

1115
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,001
<i>I got this! I got it!</i>

1116
01:10:59,423 --> 01:11:00,632
Scott, where are you?

1117
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:03,260
Scott!

1118
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:07,264
Where are you, Scott?

1119
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:10,434
- <i>I can't breathe.</i>
<i>- Ow, that's my neck.</i>

1120
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,854
<i>Stop kicking me!</i>

1121
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:15,730
Help!

1122
01:11:15,814 --> 01:11:17,232
<i>-Oh, my back!
- We're all gonna die!</i>

1123
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:18,316
Get off me!

1124
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,568
Dad.

1125
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:23,655
<i>Come back.</i>

1126
01:11:24,406 --> 01:11:25,574
<i>Dad,</i>

1127
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:27,784
<i>if you can hear me,</i>

1128
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:30,871
<i>come back.
Just come back.</i>

1129
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:33,457
- <i>Don't give up.</i>
- Come on.

1130
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:35,250
<i>- Dad, just come back...</i>
- Come on.

1131
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:36,334
<i>...one more time.</i>

1132
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:38,003
<i>- She needs us.</i>
<i>- Please.</i>

1133
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:39,546
<i>- Yes, come on.</i>
<i>- Come back.</i>

1134
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,339
<i>She needs us.
Let's do it together.</i>

1135
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:43,592
<i>-Get him up! Get him up!
- Grab him! Grab him!</i>

1136
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:44,968
Let's go.

1137
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,221
- <i>Come on, lift him!</i>
- Yes!

1138
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:50,599
- <i>I got ya, I got ya! Go.</i>
- Come on. That's it.

1139
01:11:50,682 --> 01:11:51,683
- Come on!
- <i>Give him a boost!</i>

1140
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:52,809
<i>Give him a boost!</i>

1141
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:57,314
<i>Come on, we're doing it
for Cassie! Fellas, let's go!</i>

1142
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:59,191
<i>Everyone together!</i>

1143
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:00,400
What are you doing?

1144
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:02,694
How are you able to do that?

1145
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:03,862
<i>I'll tell you how.</i>

1146
01:12:05,447 --> 01:12:07,115
We all want the same thing.

1147
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:10,744
And I'm coming, Cassie.

1148
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:20,754
Go get her, pal.

1149
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:27,677
Everyone, let's go!

1150
01:12:30,055 --> 01:12:31,306
Come on!

1151
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:40,273
Come on, closer.

1152
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:41,399
<i>Get him higher!</i>

1153
01:12:41,483 --> 01:12:43,151
<i>Hang on, guys, hang on.</i>

1154
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:45,987
<i>Careful. Steady, steady.</i>

1155
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:50,825
<i>Steady. That's it.</i>

1156
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:51,993
<i>Let's go.</i>

1157
01:12:58,375 --> 01:12:59,376
<i>What?</i>

1158
01:13:02,921 --> 01:13:04,548
<i>- No.
- What happened? Did it work?</i>

1159
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,508
Sorry, buddy!

1160
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,343
<i>- No, no, no.</i>
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

1161
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:20,438
<i>Hope, are you real?</i>

1162
01:13:20,981 --> 01:13:22,274
<i>I'm real.</i>

1163
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:23,900
<i>Then let's do this.</i>

1164
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,198
<i>You ready?</i>

1165
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:31,366
<i>Ready.</i>

1166
01:14:17,412 --> 01:14:18,455
Come on.

1167
01:14:18,622 --> 01:14:19,706
We gotta get
that thing out of here.

1168
01:14:19,873 --> 01:14:21,958
No, no, no. Wait.
He's got Cassie.

1169
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,752
- What?
- Scott.

1170
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:26,338
- Janet.
- Give that to me.

1171
01:14:26,421 --> 01:14:27,422
- We have to go now.
- No.

1172
01:14:27,589 --> 01:14:28,798
He's got Cassie.

1173
01:14:29,007 --> 01:14:30,008
We will save her.

1174
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:31,635
I promise you
we will save her,

1175
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:35,013
but you cannot
give that to him.

1176
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:36,640
I wouldn't trust her.

1177
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,354
Janet has a way of...

1178
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,858
changing her mind.

1179
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:56,201
Hello, Jellybean.

1180
01:15:02,374 --> 01:15:03,458
So...

1181
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:08,880
what's it gonna be, Scott?

1182
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:14,719
<i>Well, well.</i>

1183
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:18,723
<i>If it isn't my old mentor.</i>

1184
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:24,104
<i>Hi, Hank.</i>

1185
01:15:27,691 --> 01:15:28,692
Darren?

1186
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:30,360
Didn't expect to see

1187
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:31,778
your protégé again
after all...

1188
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:33,655
Holy shit, Darren.

1189
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:35,949
What happened to you?

1190
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:38,535
I'm the ultimate weapon!

1191
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:50,839
Do I need to take it?

1192
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:52,465
Where is my daughter?

1193
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:55,552
Scott.

1194
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:57,887
Don't.

1195
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:01,015
We had a deal.

1196
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:03,017
She'll be fine without you.

1197
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,170
<i>So long, Hank.</i>

1198
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:38,720
Henry.

1199
01:16:45,894 --> 01:16:48,188
You left me right here to die.

1200
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:53,818
Let's see how they do.

1201
01:17:54,629 --> 01:17:56,089
What did you see?

1202
01:18:04,806 --> 01:18:08,184
We didn't really get a chance
to talk about it last time.

1203
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:11,312
But I always wondered.

1204
01:18:15,108 --> 01:18:17,026
When you touched my mind...

1205
01:18:28,496 --> 01:18:30,206
what did you see?

1206
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,292
A monster

1207
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:35,211
who thinks he's a god.

1208
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:38,047
When you can see time
the way I do,

1209
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:40,133
you don't get
to close your eyes.

1210
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:43,011
And you're the only one
who sees?

1211
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:47,891
I am the only one
that can see it's broken.

1212
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:49,350
And who broke it?

1213
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:53,021
I did.

1214
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:57,233
Every version of me.

1215
01:18:58,401 --> 01:18:59,861
My variants.

1216
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:01,946
Throughout the Multiverse.

1217
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,452
Playing with time,
like children.

1218
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:12,874
But I saw how it ends.

1219
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:16,169
I saw their chaos

1220
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:19,923
spreading across realities.

1221
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:23,343
Universes colliding.

1222
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,054
Endless incursions.

1223
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:29,349
I saw the Multiverse.

1224
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:31,935
And it was dying.

1225
01:19:33,645 --> 01:19:34,979
All because of them.

1226
01:19:36,481 --> 01:19:38,316
So, I took control.

1227
01:19:39,025 --> 01:19:40,860
You mean you started a war.

1228
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:42,946
And now you wanna wipe away

1229
01:19:43,029 --> 01:19:44,948
any universe
that's a threat to you.

1230
01:19:46,032 --> 01:19:47,659
That's what monsters do.

1231
01:19:47,742 --> 01:19:50,703
That's what conquerors do.

1232
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,957
They burn the broken world.

1233
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:57,752
And they make a new one.

1234
01:19:57,919 --> 01:20:00,797
You don't care about saving
anything or anyone.

1235
01:20:02,924 --> 01:20:05,259
You only want revenge
because they beat you.

1236
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:07,136
Because you lost.

1237
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,347
I have lost.

1238
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:15,144
You have no idea
what I have lost.

1239
01:20:16,688 --> 01:20:20,566
And I will burn them
out of time

1240
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:22,151
for what they've done to me.

1241
01:20:23,111 --> 01:20:27,073
You'll be wiping out
entire timelines.

1242
01:20:27,782 --> 01:20:30,910
Murdering trillions of people.

1243
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:34,831
I wish that mattered, Janet.

1244
01:20:56,811 --> 01:20:58,271
<i>Oh, God.
What am I doing?</i>

1245
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:10,241
<i>What?</i>

1246
01:21:14,454 --> 01:21:15,455
<i>Hank!</i>

1247
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,376
Are these your ants?

1248
01:21:21,044 --> 01:21:22,128
From the ant farm?

1249
01:21:22,295 --> 01:21:24,172
Yes, Scott, they're my ants.

1250
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:25,965
How did you find them
down here?

1251
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:30,136
I've been picking up strange
signals ever since we crashed.

1252
01:21:32,305 --> 01:21:34,932
<i>First I thought
maybe it was a malfunction.</i>

1253
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:36,684
Some kind of interference.

1254
01:21:36,851 --> 01:21:38,728
What is that?

1255
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:40,021
But it wasn't.

1256
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:42,607
It was the ants.

1257
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:47,445
They were reaching out
the whole time.

1258
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:50,490
<i>Apparently,
they passed through</i>

1259
01:21:50,573 --> 01:21:52,366
<i>some sort of time dilation.</i>

1260
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,745
<i>They've lived thousands
of years in a single day,</i>

1261
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:59,332
<i>expanding their knowledge,
their science,</i>

1262
01:21:59,624 --> 01:22:00,792
<i>becoming more advanced</i>

1263
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:02,502
<i>than I could
have ever thought.</i>

1264
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:04,253
<i>I didn't find them.</i>

1265
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:06,380
They found me.

1266
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:10,093
I told you they were smart.

1267
01:22:12,553 --> 01:22:13,805
They've already
built something

1268
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:17,558
of a technocratic
Class-Two civilization.

1269
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:20,728
I mean, I know socialism
is a charged word,

1270
01:22:20,895 --> 01:22:22,897
but we could
learn a lot from these...

1271
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,065
Dad.

1272
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,150
Yeah, they're my ants.

1273
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:28,903
And ants don't give up.

1274
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:30,321
I don't care who this guy is.

1275
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:31,697
I don't care what he can do.

1276
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:32,907
I'm getting Cassie.

1277
01:22:33,241 --> 01:22:35,451
So, how do we
even the odds against Kang?

1278
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:40,039
We've got some ideas.

1279
01:22:40,206 --> 01:22:41,207
What are you thinking?

1280
01:22:41,374 --> 01:22:44,377
Well, as a great writer
once said,

1281
01:22:45,336 --> 01:22:47,588
"There's always room to grow."

1282
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:51,050
You read my book?

1283
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:55,138
Every goddamn word.

1284
01:22:57,765 --> 01:22:59,142
Come on. Let's go to work.

1285
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:13,990
Hey! I'm sorry.

1286
01:23:14,073 --> 01:23:15,908
That was probably terrifying.

1287
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:17,368
What are you doing here?

1288
01:23:18,077 --> 01:23:19,245
I'm rescuing you.

1289
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:20,621
How?

1290
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:23,833
That's a good question.

1291
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:27,128
Does this thing
have like a key?

1292
01:23:27,295 --> 01:23:29,297
Or a card? Like a room key?

1293
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:30,673
Do you know, like a...

1294
01:23:32,633 --> 01:23:33,634
Shit!

1295
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,351
<i>Jump and tap.</i>

1296
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,403
Jentorra.

1297
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:55,615
I'm sorry
I got your people hurt.

1298
01:23:57,325 --> 01:23:58,326
How can I help?

1299
01:24:03,497 --> 01:24:04,540
Wow.

1300
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:05,875
Let's hurt 'em back.

1301
01:24:07,084 --> 01:24:08,294
Damn, you're cool.

1302
01:24:09,212 --> 01:24:10,338
Do you have a plan?

1303
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:11,589
Freeing you
was basically my plan.

1304
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:13,799
Do you have a plan?

1305
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,010
We need to get a message out
to anyone who can still fight.

1306
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:18,346
Then free our people
from the detention cells below

1307
01:24:18,429 --> 01:24:19,722
and launch a counteroffensive
from within.

1308
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:20,806
Yeah, you have a plan.

1309
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:22,183
So, how do we get
a message out?

1310
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:24,518
- Follow me.
- Okay. Great.

1311
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:32,151
I built an empire
down here, Janet.

1312
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:36,155
And I'm taking it with me.

1313
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:53,589
You really should've
let me out

1314
01:24:53,673 --> 01:24:55,049
when you had the chance.

1315
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:07,436
History is not written.

1316
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:10,690
<i>It is forged.</i>

1317
01:25:11,482 --> 01:25:13,317
<i>Today, we ascend.</i>

1318
01:25:14,193 --> 01:25:15,736
<i>From this fortress,</i>

1319
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:19,198
<i>I will take my revenge
on those who banished me.</i>

1320
01:25:20,658 --> 01:25:24,036
<i>Today we conquer eternity.</i>

1321
01:25:24,829 --> 01:25:26,998
<i>And the dynasty of Kang
shall...</i>

1322
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,628
<i>Hello?
Is this working?</i>

1323
01:25:33,212 --> 01:25:34,213
Cassie?

1324
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:36,257
<i>I can't tell
if this is working.</i>

1325
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:39,135
Okay. I think we're on.

1326
01:25:39,302 --> 01:25:40,720
I'll hold them off.
Get the message out.

1327
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:42,555
I thought you were getting
the message out.

1328
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:45,308
Now!

1329
01:25:46,559 --> 01:25:48,728
We're inside.
We breached the tower.

1330
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:49,895
<i>And I'm with Jentorra.</i>

1331
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:51,480
<i>He's not invincible.</i>

1332
01:25:57,695 --> 01:25:59,655
I know it might feel like

1333
01:25:59,822 --> 01:26:01,198
<i>it's too late,</i>

1334
01:26:01,741 --> 01:26:04,910
<i>like all we do is just lose.</i>

1335
01:26:05,453 --> 01:26:07,038
<i>But the family I've lost</i>

1336
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:09,290
<i>taught me to keep fighting.</i>

1337
01:26:09,457 --> 01:26:11,334
<i>And if they were here,
they would too.</i>

1338
01:26:12,168 --> 01:26:14,170
<i>We need to lookout
for the little guy.</i>

1339
01:26:14,712 --> 01:26:16,130
My dad taught me that.

1340
01:26:16,589 --> 01:26:18,341
<i>'Cause when people
needed help,</i>

1341
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:21,177
<i>he didn't look the other way.</i>

1342
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:22,470
<i>And neither do we.</i>

1343
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:26,015
We need to move!

1344
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:28,267
Come to the tower! Fight back!

1345
01:26:28,434 --> 01:26:30,811
<i>I know you've been waiting.
Now is the time to strike.</i>

1346
01:26:30,978 --> 01:26:33,147
He knows
he can't take all of us.

1347
01:26:33,314 --> 01:26:34,440
<i>Come to the...</i>

1348
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:35,608
Cassie.

1349
01:26:35,775 --> 01:26:37,777
I think I found the signal.
Mom's gotta be there, too.

1350
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:39,403
- Let's go.
- I'll drive.

1351
01:26:45,618 --> 01:26:46,994
Find Lang's daughter.

1352
01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:51,374
Kill her.

1353
01:27:10,476 --> 01:27:11,519
Let's go. Let's go!

1354
01:27:12,103 --> 01:27:13,354
If you want to fight,
follow me!

1355
01:27:18,192 --> 01:27:19,402
<i>It's over, Cassie.</i>

1356
01:27:19,819 --> 01:27:21,487
Free the others. Go!

1357
01:27:29,662 --> 01:27:30,746
He's gonna see us coming.

1358
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:32,957
Yeah. I'll make sure of it.

1359
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:35,042
Begin the launch.

1360
01:28:27,386 --> 01:28:28,846
<i>Your dad's not here, Cassie,</i>

1361
01:28:29,388 --> 01:28:31,098
but I guess
that's not a big surprise.

1362
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,040
<i>Kang!</i>

1363
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:59,043
<i>We had a deal.</i>

1364
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:03,464
<i>You took my daughter!</i>

1365
01:29:05,883 --> 01:29:07,843
Holy shit.

1366
01:29:07,927 --> 01:29:09,094
That's big.

1367
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:19,480
<i>You lied to me!</i>

1368
01:29:20,773 --> 01:29:22,900
<i>Our word is our bond.</i>

1369
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:26,445
<i>Without that, we're nothing!</i>

1370
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:29,698
- Bring him down.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

1371
01:29:36,455 --> 01:29:37,831
<i>Keep going.
I've got them.</i>

1372
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,085
<i>Yeah, come on!</i>

1373
01:29:55,599 --> 01:29:56,809
<i>There's so many!</i>

1374
01:29:56,976 --> 01:29:59,228
<i>Scott!
I can't hold them!</i>

1375
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:11,365
<i>They came.</i>

1376
01:30:13,117 --> 01:30:15,119
<i>Way to go, Cassie!</i>

1377
01:30:17,538 --> 01:30:18,622
Yes!

1378
01:30:18,956 --> 01:30:21,375
<i>Come on! Let's go!</i>

1379
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:28,257
Revolution!

1380
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:43,397
Burn it all down.

1381
01:30:43,564 --> 01:30:45,733
Fight!

1382
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:03,959
Cover! Get down!

1383
01:31:12,635 --> 01:31:14,136
What is the bridge code?

1384
01:31:14,637 --> 01:31:15,763
<i>I'll die first.</i>

1385
01:31:15,846 --> 01:31:18,015
One-eight-one-four-seven.

1386
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:19,183
<i>Damn!</i>

1387
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:35,574
You'll need this.

1388
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:38,786
Hi.

1389
01:31:39,662 --> 01:31:40,663
This is our home!

1390
01:31:41,664 --> 01:31:43,040
Let's take it back!

1391
01:31:47,503 --> 01:31:48,504
No!

1392
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:57,805
I have holes.

1393
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:02,226
I have holes!

1394
01:32:08,899 --> 01:32:10,192
I didn't know
he could do that.

1395
01:32:19,952 --> 01:32:20,953
<i>Kang!</i>

1396
01:32:21,537 --> 01:32:22,830
<i>Where is she?</i>

1397
01:32:23,497 --> 01:32:24,707
Launch now!

1398
01:32:34,717 --> 01:32:35,926
<i>Whoa.</i>

1399
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:37,511
<i>What is that?</i>

1400
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:39,346
<i>He's getting out.</i>

1401
01:32:39,722 --> 01:32:40,889
<i>Oh, no, he's not.</i>

1402
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:50,149
Keep him away from the rings.

1403
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:30,481
Whoa! Dad!

1404
01:33:33,275 --> 01:33:34,610
Dad, I'm coming!

1405
01:33:46,163 --> 01:33:47,164
Dad!

1406
01:33:55,506 --> 01:33:57,007
Nowhere left to run.

1407
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:07,100
Please let this work.

1408
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:27,037
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

1409
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,163
Let's go.

1410
01:34:28,539 --> 01:34:30,374
You think this is over?
Come on! Let's go.

1411
01:34:30,457 --> 01:34:32,042
Darren, just stop

1412
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:34,837
trying to be whatever this is.

1413
01:34:35,629 --> 01:34:37,130
I don't know what to be.

1414
01:34:39,216 --> 01:34:40,717
Tell me what to be.

1415
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:43,178
I don't know.
Just don't be a dick.

1416
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:45,347
It's too late.

1417
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:47,099
Look at me.

1418
01:34:48,684 --> 01:34:50,227
I'm such a dick.

1419
01:34:50,644 --> 01:34:53,063
It's never too late
to stop being a dick.

1420
01:34:58,777 --> 01:34:59,945
<i>we've gotta stop him.</i>

1421
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,156
<i>I have an idea.</i>

1422
01:35:05,701 --> 01:35:06,702
<i>Ready?</i>

1423
01:35:06,869 --> 01:35:08,036
<i>Probably not.</i>

1424
01:35:10,831 --> 01:35:13,292
<i>One, two, three. Now!</i>

1425
01:35:36,315 --> 01:35:37,649
Dad!

1426
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:38,901
Dad!

1427
01:35:39,735 --> 01:35:40,736
Cassie?

1428
01:35:42,696 --> 01:35:43,697
You're huge.

1429
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:46,199
I'm huge.

1430
01:35:49,828 --> 01:35:51,413
I love you, Peanut.

1431
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:52,915
I love you too.

1432
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:54,875
I'm so proud of you.

1433
01:35:55,626 --> 01:35:57,669
I feel like
I'm hugging Godzilla.

1434
01:35:57,836 --> 01:36:00,422
I know. It feels so cool.

1435
01:36:00,714 --> 01:36:02,382
I know, right?

1436
01:36:03,133 --> 01:36:04,259
I'm so hungry.

1437
01:36:04,426 --> 01:36:05,427
Yeah, that happens.

1438
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:07,763
- I could eat everything.
- Everything. I know.

1439
01:36:08,305 --> 01:36:09,640
But I really want like a lime.

1440
01:36:09,723 --> 01:36:10,724
Right?

1441
01:36:10,807 --> 01:36:12,935
- Citrus. It's weird. I know.
- Citrus.

1442
01:36:13,018 --> 01:36:14,019
It's...

1443
01:36:23,904 --> 01:36:26,281
Take the tower!

1444
01:36:57,938 --> 01:36:59,189
It's over.

1445
01:37:01,108 --> 01:37:03,110
You still can't see it.

1446
01:37:05,112 --> 01:37:07,990
It's never over.

1447
01:38:24,733 --> 01:38:26,485
- We have to go, right now.
- No.

1448
01:38:26,568 --> 01:38:27,569
- Come on.
- No!

1449
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:28,987
I know, I know,
but we have to go.

1450
01:38:29,071 --> 01:38:30,447
- No!
- Come on.

1451
01:39:20,497 --> 01:39:21,832
<i>You son of a...</i>

1452
01:39:25,001 --> 01:39:26,503
- Oh, God.
- Scott.

1453
01:39:26,795 --> 01:39:27,796
Come on.

1454
01:39:32,551 --> 01:39:35,178
You think
this is new to me?

1455
01:39:36,513 --> 01:39:41,226
Do you know how many
rebellions I have put down?

1456
01:39:42,936 --> 01:39:44,479
No, no, no, no, no.

1457
01:39:44,563 --> 01:39:48,066
How many worlds
I've conquered?

1458
01:39:48,942 --> 01:39:51,153
How many Avengers I've killed?

1459
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:53,864
And you think you can beat me?

1460
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:55,615
I am Kang!

1461
01:39:55,699 --> 01:39:56,741
You...

1462
01:39:57,784 --> 01:40:00,036
You talk to ants.

1463
01:41:19,908 --> 01:41:22,452
My name is Darren,

1464
01:41:22,619 --> 01:41:27,123
and I am not a dick!

1465
01:41:48,645 --> 01:41:49,896
Sorry I'm late.

1466
01:41:52,190 --> 01:41:53,441
Lotta ants.

1467
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:55,860
Oh, is this you?

1468
01:41:57,153 --> 01:41:59,447
Maybe you were right
about me, Cassie.

1469
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:01,741
Darren.

1470
01:42:03,535 --> 01:42:04,536
Are you okay?

1471
01:42:07,289 --> 01:42:08,540
Probably not.

1472
01:42:09,874 --> 01:42:11,543
- Darren?
- Hi, Hope.

1473
01:42:12,502 --> 01:42:13,962
You changed your hair.

1474
01:42:16,715 --> 01:42:18,591
What the hell happened?

1475
01:42:19,342 --> 01:42:20,343
Yeah. No, it's...

1476
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:22,178
It's a whole thing.
I'll tell you later.

1477
01:42:22,971 --> 01:42:23,972
That was... I...

1478
01:42:24,514 --> 01:42:25,932
I don't know what to say.

1479
01:42:26,516 --> 01:42:27,809
Thanks, Scott.

1480
01:42:28,435 --> 01:42:31,646
You always were
a brother to me.

1481
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:34,774
I was?

1482
01:42:42,657 --> 01:42:43,742
I was.

1483
01:42:57,881 --> 01:42:59,549
And at least I died

1484
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:02,635
an Avenger.

1485
01:43:05,889 --> 01:43:06,931
Yeah.

1486
01:43:07,974 --> 01:43:09,642
- You did.
- Yeah. No, it's...

1487
01:43:09,726 --> 01:43:11,269
You're in.

1488
01:43:27,327 --> 01:43:28,953
A lot has happened today.

1489
01:43:29,746 --> 01:43:30,914
<i>- Henry?
- Janet?</i>

1490
01:43:30,997 --> 01:43:32,874
- Mom, where are you?
<i>- I'm in the tower.</i>

1491
01:43:33,041 --> 01:43:35,043
I think I can give us
one shot back.

1492
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:37,003
But we don't have much time.

1493
01:43:37,212 --> 01:43:38,838
If we wanna go home...

1494
01:43:41,299 --> 01:43:42,717
we have to go now.

1495
01:43:43,343 --> 01:43:44,344
We'll finish this.

1496
01:43:46,638 --> 01:43:47,680
Thank you.

1497
01:43:48,765 --> 01:43:50,141
Thank you.

1498
01:43:50,225 --> 01:43:51,643
Oh, wow!

1499
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:53,269
Come on! Let's go!

1500
01:43:53,436 --> 01:43:54,646
All right. Good luck.

1501
01:43:55,021 --> 01:43:56,064
Good luck.
Come on.

1502
01:44:26,761 --> 01:44:27,762
Thanks, buddy.

1503
01:44:30,098 --> 01:44:31,099
You did it.

1504
01:44:34,894 --> 01:44:36,020
Let's go home.

1505
01:44:57,876 --> 01:44:58,877
Where's Scott?

1506
01:44:59,043 --> 01:45:00,587
He was right behind me.

1507
01:45:43,671 --> 01:45:45,256
You should've
looked the other way.

1508
01:45:45,423 --> 01:45:48,092
Yeah, well,
never been great at that.

1509
01:45:56,059 --> 01:45:57,519
And you're not getting out.

1510
01:46:07,153 --> 01:46:09,531
I want you to remember.

1511
01:46:11,032 --> 01:46:12,575
You could've gone home.

1512
01:46:27,715 --> 01:46:29,759
You could've seen
your daughter again.

1513
01:46:43,523 --> 01:46:44,941
But you thought you could win.

1514
01:46:58,329 --> 01:46:59,831
I don't have to win.

1515
01:47:01,332 --> 01:47:03,251
We both just have to lose.

1516
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,637
Dad!

1517
01:48:02,852 --> 01:48:03,853
Where... Where...

1518
01:48:04,145 --> 01:48:05,229
Where is she? Is she...

1519
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:06,689
- No, she's okay.
- Where is she?

1520
01:48:06,773 --> 01:48:08,524
She's okay.
She's okay. She's okay.

1521
01:48:08,608 --> 01:48:10,026
- Scott, they're all okay.
- She's safe?

1522
01:48:10,109 --> 01:48:11,486
They're all okay. You did it.

1523
01:48:11,653 --> 01:48:12,654
You did it.

1524
01:48:16,074 --> 01:48:17,992
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
- No, no, no.

1525
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:19,577
No, don't let go.
Don't let go.

1526
01:48:20,203 --> 01:48:21,371
Don't let go.

1527
01:48:21,537 --> 01:48:22,789
Don't ever let go.

1528
01:48:24,415 --> 01:48:25,750
I got you.

1529
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,712
You came back.

1530
01:48:40,098 --> 01:48:41,391
I love you, Hope.

1531
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:45,395
I love you, Scott.

1532
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:00,595
Let's go home.

1533
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,474
Home's good.

1534
01:50:12,899 --> 01:50:14,567
<i>My life
doesn't make sense.</i>

1535
01:50:14,734 --> 01:50:17,028
<i>I used to ask myself
a lot of questions about that.</i>

1536
01:50:17,111 --> 01:50:18,446
- Ah.
- <i>"Scott you just saved</i>

1537
01:50:18,529 --> 01:50:19,947
<i>"the Quantum Realm
with your family</i>

1538
01:50:20,114 --> 01:50:21,991
<i>"and drank a guy
without holes.</i>

1539
01:50:22,158 --> 01:50:24,410
<i>"Why does this kind of stuff
keep happening to you?</i>

1540
01:50:24,577 --> 01:50:26,078
<i>"That doesn't make any sense."</i>

1541
01:50:26,245 --> 01:50:27,747
<i>But you know what?</i>

1542
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:29,749
<i>Who said life
has to make sense?</i>

1543
01:50:34,086 --> 01:50:35,087
Ruben!

1544
01:50:35,254 --> 01:50:37,632
You are the bug!

1545
01:50:37,715 --> 01:50:40,218
I was wrong. Yeah.
You are the other bug.

1546
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,677
You're the bug man.

1547
01:50:41,844 --> 01:50:44,430
You get big and get small
like a big bug!

1548
01:50:45,097 --> 01:50:47,725
You're right. That's me.
Just a coffee, please.

1549
01:50:47,892 --> 01:50:48,893
Twelve dollar.

1550
01:50:49,143 --> 01:50:50,269
Oh.

1551
01:50:50,728 --> 01:50:51,771
Twelve!

1552
01:50:51,938 --> 01:50:54,482
<i>I used to wonder if this
chapter in my life was over,</i>

1553
01:50:54,649 --> 01:50:55,983
<i>but as Cassie reminded me,</i>

1554
01:50:56,067 --> 01:50:57,819
<i>"There's always someone
you can help."</i>

1555
01:50:58,611 --> 01:51:00,988
Came out of cake making
retirement for you.

1556
01:51:03,449 --> 01:51:04,450
Wow.

1557
01:51:05,076 --> 01:51:06,452
You... You made this yourself?

1558
01:51:06,536 --> 01:51:08,037
Yeah! I don't usually
make the cakes.

1559
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:09,121
I know.

1560
01:51:09,205 --> 01:51:10,998
This is the first one
I've made since 1997.

1561
01:51:11,165 --> 01:51:12,375
You're a real artist.

1562
01:51:12,542 --> 01:51:14,502
<i>It's been a pretty wild ride.</i>

1563
01:51:14,669 --> 01:51:17,088
<i>One day you're fired
from Baskin-Robbins,</i>

1564
01:51:17,255 --> 01:51:20,049
<i>the next you're beating
a time-traveling space king.</i>

1565
01:51:21,133 --> 01:51:23,094
<i>We did beat him, right?</i>

1566
01:51:24,554 --> 01:51:25,680
<i>I mean, yeah,
that's what happened.</i>

1567
01:51:25,763 --> 01:51:28,099
<i>He... He was getting out
and he didn't get out.</i>

1568
01:51:29,559 --> 01:51:30,643
<i>I think.</i>

1569
01:51:32,144 --> 01:51:34,730
<i>But he also said
something bad was coming</i>

1570
01:51:35,147 --> 01:51:37,608
<i>and that everyone would die
if he didn't get out.</i>

1571
01:51:38,776 --> 01:51:41,028
<i>Wait.
So, did I just kill everyone?</i>

1572
01:51:41,737 --> 01:51:43,781
<i>Is everyone gonna die
because of me?</i>

1573
01:51:43,948 --> 01:51:46,117
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1574
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,660
<i>Oh, my... What did I do?</i>

1575
01:51:48,202 --> 01:51:49,787
<i>What... What did...</i>

1576
01:51:49,871 --> 01:51:51,247
<i>What did I do?</i>

1577
01:51:53,666 --> 01:51:55,376
<i>You know what?</i>

1578
01:51:55,459 --> 01:51:57,295
<i>It's probably fine.</i>

1579
01:51:57,378 --> 01:51:59,463
<i>Like I said,
life doesn't make any sense,</i>

1580
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:02,758
<i>so maybe stop asking
so many questions, Scott.</i>

1581
01:52:02,925 --> 01:52:04,385
<i>Stop over thinking it.</i>

1582
01:52:06,888 --> 01:52:08,681
Surprise!

1583
01:52:08,848 --> 01:52:12,977
<i>Happy Birthday to you</i>

1584
01:52:14,186 --> 01:52:15,521
It's not my birthday.

1585
01:52:15,688 --> 01:52:18,190
I know. But I missed a few.

1586
01:52:20,610 --> 01:52:22,486
<i>This is good.
We're all together.</i>

1587
01:52:22,862 --> 01:52:24,280
<i>You're fine.</i>

1588
01:52:24,447 --> 01:52:27,366
<i>Everything's probably fine.</i>

1589
01:52:27,533 --> 01:52:29,869
<i>Kang's gone. You did it.</i>

1590
01:52:30,995 --> 01:52:32,705
<i>Don't have to worry
about that guy anymore.</i>

1591
01:52:32,788 --> 01:52:33,915
Ah. Thanks.

1592
01:52:37,418 --> 01:52:39,420
Happy fake birthday, Cassie.

1593
01:52:43,549 --> 01:52:44,926
Oh.

1594
01:55:17,286 --> 01:55:20,873
So, the exiled one
is dead.

1595
01:55:23,167 --> 01:55:25,086
You sure he's dead?

1596
01:55:25,711 --> 01:55:28,589
If it wasn't true,
I wouldn't call you.

1597
01:55:29,215 --> 01:55:30,549
Must really eat you up,

1598
01:55:30,633 --> 01:55:32,343
that you're not
the one who killed him.

1599
01:55:32,676 --> 01:55:35,346
None of us

1600
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:37,890
killed him.

1601
01:55:40,184 --> 01:55:41,560
They did.

1602
01:55:42,436 --> 01:55:46,982
They're beginning to touch
the Multiverse.

1603
01:55:47,650 --> 01:55:49,110
And if we let them,

1604
01:55:49,568 --> 01:55:51,403
they will take...

1605
01:55:52,822 --> 01:55:54,448
everything

1606
01:55:55,366 --> 01:55:57,368
we've built.

1607
01:55:58,410 --> 01:56:00,955
So let's stop wasting time.

1608
01:56:04,583 --> 01:56:05,793
We're late.

1609
01:56:07,795 --> 01:56:10,131
How many did you call?

1610
01:56:10,464 --> 01:56:12,883
All of us.

1611
02:03:35,784 --> 02:03:40,789
Time is everything.

1612
02:03:46,044 --> 02:03:49,047
It shapes our lives.

1613
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:54,303
But, perhaps, we can shape...

1614
02:03:56,096 --> 02:03:57,180
...it.

1615
02:03:58,432 --> 02:03:59,558
It's him.

1616
02:03:59,975 --> 02:04:01,226
What?
You made him sound

1617
02:04:01,310 --> 02:04:03,270
like this terrifying figure.

1618
02:04:04,938 --> 02:04:06,023
He is.
