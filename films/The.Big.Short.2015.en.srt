00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:28,064
hi ya Frank, how are the wife and kids?

3
00:01:28,185 --> 00:01:31,525
You know, shouldn't y'all be considering
treasury bonds or utility stocks?

4
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:34,344
In the late seventies

5
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:37,745
banking wasn't a job you went into
to make large sums of money.

6
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:40,805
It was a fucking snooze!

7
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,865
Filled with losers!

8
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:46,835
Like selling insurance,
or accounting

9
00:01:46,954 --> 00:01:48,354
and if banking was boring...

10
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:50,754
Then the bond department at the bank
was straight up comatose.

11
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,444
We all know about bonds...

12
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:55,185
You give em to your snot nosed kid
when he turns fifteen

13
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:57,125
maybe when he's thirty
he makes a hundred bucks.

14
00:01:57,194 --> 00:01:58,395
Boring!

15
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:01,435
That is until Lewis rainieri
came on the scene at Salomon brothers

16
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:09,044
you might not know who he is

17
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:12,884
but he changed your life more than Michael
Jordan, the I-pod and YouTube put together!

18
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:17,778
Hey gentlemen, let's get
some money in here.

19
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,865
Let's make some money!
What do you say?!

20
00:02:21,064 --> 00:02:24,844
You see, Lewis didn't know it yet,
but he already changed banking forever

21
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:26,905
with one simple idea.

22
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:29,134
The mortgage backed security.

23
00:02:29,254 --> 00:02:31,704
Or... private label mbs

24
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:34,343
you got your average persons mortgage

25
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:38,055
fixed rate, thirty years, boring!
Same, small payoff. Right!

26
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:39,724
But.

27
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:43,014
When you add thousands of them
all bundled together

28
00:02:43,134 --> 00:02:46,735
suddenly, the yield goes up, but the
risk is still small, because...

29
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:49,574
Well, they're mortgages, and who the
hell doesn't pay their mortgage?

30
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:51,944
What exactly is the
credit-rating on this bond?

31
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:54,604
This bond gentlemen...
Is AAA-rating!

32
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:58,375
This is exactly what the Michigan state
pension fund has been looking for!

33
00:02:58,495 --> 00:03:01,724
I'll buy twenty million!
Oh come on, live a little!

34
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:02,844
Twenty five million!

35
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:05,844
The money came raining down!

36
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:10,854
And for the first time, the banker went
from the country-club to the strip-club.

37
00:03:13,134 --> 00:03:15,944
Pretty soon, stocks and savings
were almost inconsequential.

38
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,974
They were doing fifty, a hundred,
two hundred billion in mortgage bonds

39
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:21,974
and dozens of other securities a year.

40
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:34,534
And America barely noticed that it's number
one industry became boring old banking

41
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:42,264
and then one day,
almost thirty years later, in 2008

42
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,664
it all came crashing down!

43
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:53,235
Bear sterns was in a death spiral
and the fed brokered it's sale.

44
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:06,715
In the end Lewis rainier's
mortgage backed security mutated

45
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:09,425
into a monstrosity that collapsed
the whole world economy

46
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:13,764
and none of the experts, or leaders,
or talking heads had a clue it was coming.

47
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:18,125
And I'm guessing most of you
still don't really know what happened.

48
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:21,514
Yeah, you got to have somebody to repeat
so you don't sound dumb, but come on.

49
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:24,204
Our financial institutions are strong!

50
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:27,355
But there were some who saw it coming.

51
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:30,281
While the whole world was
having a big old party, few

52
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:32,615
outsiders and weirdos saw
what no-one else could.

53
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:36,447
Not me, I'm not a weirdo,
I'm pretty fucking

54
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:39,055
cool, but we'll
meet again later!

55
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:42,165
These outsiders saw the giant lie
at the heart of the economy

56
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:45,855
and they saw it by doing something the
rest of the suckers never thought to do.

57
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:48,425
They looked

58
00:05:01,504 --> 00:05:03,675
through the nineteen thirties.

59
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:09,595
The housing market collapsed...
Nationwide.

60
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:13,185
By approximately 8 percent.

61
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:19,144
And halve of all .. Eh... worries that...
It wasn't default.

62
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:21,954
There were.. Very...

63
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:27,045
Specific identifiers.
Extremely recognizable.

64
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:30,185
Wait... for instance

65
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:33,735
w-w-w-w one of the hallmarks of mania.

66
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:37,704
Is that rapid rise and complexity,
and the rates... they are fraud-ed

67
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:40,654
did you know...
They're going up!

68
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:05,035
I've always been.. More comfortable..
When alone.

69
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:16,425
I believe... maybe... it's because of...
My glass eye.

70
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:22,084
I lost the eye...
In a childhood illness.

71
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:28,334
Separates me from people.

72
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:35,154
Did you know... they're going up!

73
00:06:36,045 --> 00:06:39,235
Highest frog-rates since
the nineteen thirties.

74
00:06:42,014 --> 00:06:44,115
No, I didn't know that.

75
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:49,965
I mean.. Ghe ghe ghe...
Nine... nineteen thirty three

76
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:53,185
the fourth year of the great depression

77
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:57,514
you were playing saying great son,
even heard the coach say it!

78
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:01,595
Can we just go home?

79
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,814
All social interf.. Actions
are awkward for me and for the... person

80
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:10,904
even when I try to compliment...
It somehow... it comes out wrong...

81
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:15,564
You have a very nice haircut,
you do it yourself?

82
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:17,485
Huh, what?

83
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:20,704
No, I eh...

84
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:30,654
I'm sorry... please...

85
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:35,485
Pffffff...

86
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,625
I'm going on and on.
My wife told me I need to share more.

87
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:42,524
That seems healthy.

88
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:59,644
So .. I get the job?
I really think I could help you fund.

89
00:08:01,095 --> 00:08:03,495
Yeah... Yeah... sure!

90
00:08:07,014 --> 00:08:09,425
You're David!... David... great!

91
00:08:09,935 --> 00:08:14,675
I guess I'll go find a desk. Is there
anything you want me to work on for start?

92
00:08:15,714 --> 00:08:18,975
Eh... yeah.

93
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:20,454
You could let me know later!

94
00:08:21,314 --> 00:08:25,185
<s> D... d... d... did ya... did you</s>

95
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:27,444
think it was strange when...

96
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:28,615
Ehm...

97
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:30,954
The tech-bubble burst in 2001

98
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:33,995
and the housing market in San-Jose.

99
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:36,365
Tech-capitol of the world...

100
00:08:37,605 --> 00:08:38,904
Went up...

101
00:08:39,725 --> 00:08:41,784
It's strange... No, no!

102
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:45,004
It's housing...
Housing is always stable... low-risk.

103
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:47,524
That's the idea... yeah.

104
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:49,144
I want you to get me...

105
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:52,404
The... eh... top-20 selling mortgage bonds

106
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:55,504
so, you want to know
what the top-20 selling mortgage bonds are?

107
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,695
No, no, no, I want to know
what mortgages are in each one

108
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:04,254
- what.. Wait...
- Aren't those mortgages made up of

109
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,605
wait... aren't those bonds made up of
thousands and thousands of mortgages?

110
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:08,884
Yeah...

111
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:14,815
Right away, Dr. burris.

112
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:37,985
Nice guy... all day long.

113
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:40,934
Hmm.. Ask anyone... hmm,
pleasure to work with.

114
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:46,414
The second my son screws up,

115
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:47,644
and...

116
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,434
You'll hang it to him...
Just like my dad did to me.

117
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:55,995
You hear the words that are
coming out of my mouth.

118
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,835
Sorry I'm late, no cabs!

119
00:10:00,335 --> 00:10:01,345
Aah

120
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:02,695
so get this...

121
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:06,115
I met with this retail banker yesterday..

122
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,125
I'm supposed to be getting
him to invest in a fund,

123
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:13,174
instead, I start drilling him
about overdraft analysis

124
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:17,004
and how his bank will let customers
write ten... twelve cheques

125
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,254
before telling them they're overdrawing.

126
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,485
And this creep...

127
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,934
Is making billions off
screwing over people this way.

128
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,014
And I'm getting madder and madder,
and I ask him.

129
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:27,024
I look him in the face and I say:

130
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:32,485
How can you sleep at night, knowing...
That you're ripping off working people.

131
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:34,794
And know what he did... He left!

132
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,434
He just walks out of the lunch,
doesn't say a word.

133
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:40,424
What the fuck is that?
Who's fucked up in that scenario?

134
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:42,414
Am I? Or is this douche-bag?

135
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:45,605
Who leaves me hanging...
Is he the fucked up one?

136
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:47,825
Trying to make me feel bad about myself!
We have talk about this numerous times

137
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:51,325
fuck him! -You can't come in late
and hijack the entire session!

138
00:10:51,575 --> 00:10:52,835
What do you mean, I didn't
hijack the meeting.

139
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:54,605
Did I hijack this session? Yeah

140
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:56,475
what do you do?

141
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:57,725
I'm in commodities.

142
00:10:58,014 --> 00:10:59,014
Good luck with that!

143
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:00,164
Marc...

144
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:03,424
I know you've suffered a terrible loss,

145
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:04,784
do you want to talk about that?

146
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,835
I don't talk about that.

147
00:11:05,924 --> 00:11:06,924
Hold on...

148
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:10,544
Hold on..
Shit.. Let's take this, sorry!

149
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:11,815
Sorry!

150
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:14,294
I don't care Porter...

151
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:18,254
This guy's whole business is build upon
ripping people off, how long can that last?

152
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:20,554
Bye everybody!

153
00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:23,004
85...

154
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:25,835
That's 30 days late, that's 60 days late.

155
00:11:28,195 --> 00:11:29,735
Pay on time.

156
00:11:33,414 --> 00:11:34,654
These fico-scores

157
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:44,054
they're caught up with their pants...

158
00:11:44,284 --> 00:11:45,465
30 days late...

159
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:47,095
Loan to value... maybe 5

160
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:48,384
maybe 90

161
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:50,524
60 days late, jeez!

162
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:52,835
I've never heard of that.

163
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:53,835
30 days late

164
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:03,134
he hasn't move all day.

165
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:05,095
He does this every few days.

166
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,735
Hasn't spoken to me since he hired me.

167
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:15,654
Michael, how are you guy?!

168
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:18,414
I've put out something
really interesting...

169
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:22,105
Great Michael, whenever you find something
interesting, we all sit to make money.

170
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:23,384
What stock are you vowing?

171
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:27,254
No, no, no no.. I wanna,
I wanna short the housing market.

172
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:31,585
Really?
But the housing market is rock-solid!

173
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:35,174
Green span just said:
"Bubbles are regional, defaults are rare!"

174
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:37,524
Tell em I'll be there in a minute

175
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,024
say again!

176
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:41,554
Look... Greenspan's wrong!

177
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,985
Look, I don't think you mean to do this,
but eh..

178
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:47,054
Sometimes you sound very
dismissive and superior.

179
00:12:47,715 --> 00:12:50,745
It's a fact, greenspan's wrong.
I don't know how if you want your thr...

180
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:52,615
Look, Michael...

181
00:12:52,735 --> 00:12:56,085
Metro capitol backed you four years ago
when you were a doctor with a

182
00:12:56,205 --> 00:12:58,664
dinky wet page
and some inheritance money,

183
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:01,085
we've all done very well, look...
Why don't you just stick with stocks...

184
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:03,404
You know me... I, I, I, I,

185
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:07,365
I look for value,
wherever it can be found.

186
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:08,485
The fact is

187
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:10,715
that these mortgage backed securities

188
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:14,865
are filled with extremely risky
sub-prime adjustable rates.

189
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:19,684
And when the majority of these
adjustable rates kick in... in '07

190
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,394
they will begin to fail

191
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:25,154
and if they fail above 15 percent
the whole bond is worthless.

192
00:13:25,274 --> 00:13:28,534
Michael, just take a beat,
we'll talk about this later!

193
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:31,455
Lawrence please, don't patronize me,
if... it .. Is...

194
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:35,684
Mortgage backed securities,
sub-prime loans, tranches...

195
00:13:36,554 --> 00:13:38,115
Is pretty confusing right?

196
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,205
Doesn't it make you feel bored...
Or stupid...

197
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:42,164
Well... it's supposed to.

198
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:45,322
Wall-street loves to use
confusing terms, to

199
00:13:45,335 --> 00:13:47,345
make you think only they
can do what they do.

200
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,315
Or even better...

201
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:51,184
For you just to leave them the fuck alone.

202
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:54,315
So... here's margot Robbie
in a bubble-bath to explain.

203
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:57,745
Basically, Lewis
rainieri's mortgage bonds

204
00:13:57,756 --> 00:14:00,355
were amazingly profitable
for the big banks.

205
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:10,264
But then they ran out of
mortgages to put in them.

206
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:13,080
After all, there are only
so many homes and so many

207
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:15,695
people with good enough
jobs to buy them... right?

208
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:21,054
So the banks started filling these
bonds with riskier and riskier mortgages

209
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:22,355
thank you Henry

210
00:14:22,955 --> 00:14:26,365
that way, they can keep that
profit machine churning right?

211
00:14:26,955 --> 00:14:31,044
By the way, these risky
mortgages are called: Sub-prime.

212
00:14:31,524 --> 00:14:34,565
So... whenever you hear sub-prime...
Think: Shit

213
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:37,875
our friend Michael burry found out,

214
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:39,495
that these mortgages bonds

215
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:44,554
that were supposedly 65 percent AAA,
were actually just, basically full of shit.

216
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:48,684
So now he's going to short the bonds

217
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,325
which means... bet against.

218
00:14:52,154 --> 00:14:54,835
Got it?... Good!

219
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:58,784
Now fuck off!

220
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:01,032
It's only a matter of
time before someone else

221
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:02,955
sees this investment,
we have to act now.

222
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:05,044
How do you know the bonds are worthless?

223
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:09,105
Aren't they filled with fucking
thousands of pages of mortgages?

224
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:10,225
I read them!

225
00:15:11,365 --> 00:15:12,965
You read them? I read... yeah!

226
00:15:13,315 --> 00:15:16,985
No-one reads them, only the lawyers
who put them together read them!

227
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:20,875
I don't think they even
know what they've made

228
00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:26,424
the housing market is
propped up on these bad loans.

229
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:29,794
It's a time-bomb and I want to short it.

230
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:32,044
Through what instrument Michael?

231
00:15:32,294 --> 00:15:35,404
There are no insurance-contracts
or options for mortgage bonds.

232
00:15:35,524 --> 00:15:36,894
The bonds are too stable!

233
00:15:37,014 --> 00:15:38,284
Lawrence...

234
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:43,054
This is what I'm gonna do...

235
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:46,995
I am gonna get a bank to make me one.

236
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,215
Then...

237
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:51,965
I'm gonna buy it.

238
00:15:53,144 --> 00:15:54,784
I don't want that kind of business!

239
00:15:55,884 --> 00:15:57,985
Money is not money!
That's bad money!

240
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:01,264
Hey... excuse me!

241
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:07,664
Let me ask you this: What company treats
its customers that shittily and succeeds?

242
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:10,394
Fine... ok... Goldman...

243
00:16:10,514 --> 00:16:11,544
Without proving it

244
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:14,715
when he was a kid he excelled
at studying the talmud and yeshiva.

245
00:16:14,835 --> 00:16:17,835
Whatever!
But, one day his rabbi told his mom why.

246
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:23,225
Paul is a fine boy and mark is an
excellent student of the torah and talmud

247
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:25,585
then what's the problem rabbi?

248
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:29,075
It's the reason mark is studying so hard.

249
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:33,875
He's looking for inconsistencies
in the word of God!

250
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,794
So has he found any?

251
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,134
Later baum started his
own fund on wall-street.

252
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:44,294
He had an amazing nose for bullshit.

253
00:16:44,414 --> 00:16:47,705
He wasn't afraid to let anyone know,
when and where the bull had gone number 2.

254
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:52,384
Then a tragedy happened to mark
and it turned his whole world really dark

255
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:54,424
and ready to believe the
whole system was a lie.

256
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:55,664
Hold on!

257
00:16:56,705 --> 00:16:59,304
It's Cynthia,
I'll be in the office in twenty minutes.

258
00:17:00,384 --> 00:17:01,384
Hi honey!

259
00:17:02,985 --> 00:17:06,305
The therapist called...
You did it again!

260
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:09,595
There were no cabs...
What was I supposed to do?

261
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:11,545
I worry about you mark!

262
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:12,664
At least I went

263
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:17,615
you're running around like you
have to right every wrong in the world.

264
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,595
Ok... fine! How angry

265
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:22,875
you know what...
I'm a mean guy and I'm pissed off!

266
00:17:23,894 --> 00:17:26,480
But... it is a shitstorm
out here sweetie. You

267
00:17:26,491 --> 00:17:29,255
have no idea the kind of
crap people are pulling.

268
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,615
And everybody is walking around like
they're in a goddamn Enya-video.

269
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:34,934
They're all getting screwed you know!

270
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,704
You know what they care about?
They care about the ballgame!

271
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:40,474
Or they care about what
actresses went into rehab!

272
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:42,974
I, I think you should try medication!

273
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,964
No, no, we agreed,
if it interfered with work.

274
00:17:46,194 --> 00:17:48,625
You hate wall-street,
but maybe it's time to quit?

275
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:50,755
I love my job!
You hate your job!

276
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,674
I love my job! You're miserable!

277
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:55,494
I love my job,
I love my job honey!

278
00:17:55,714 --> 00:17:56,714
Mark!

279
00:17:58,255 --> 00:18:01,115
I am sad every day about what happened.

280
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:04,325
I know you must feel the same,
but you never show it!

281
00:18:10,934 --> 00:18:13,555
I knew how close you were to your brother.

282
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:17,634
Cab!

283
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,494
Where'd ya go pal?

284
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:26,855
Cab!!

285
00:18:32,964 --> 00:18:35,894
Everyday I think you're gonna talk
about it, and you're gonna do!

286
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:43,035
Will you ever think about
the idea of making a change?

287
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:47,454
Fine, fine, honey, you know what,
I will consider it, but honestly...

288
00:18:47,815 --> 00:18:49,744
Cynthia I'm ok, I really am!

289
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:52,055
Hey, hey! No, no, my cab!

290
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,984
That's my cab, that's my cab,
that is my cab!

291
00:18:55,105 --> 00:18:57,335
Schmuck! Fuck you! Fuck you!

292
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:00,855
I'll call you later.

293
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:11,855
I wanna buy...
Swaps on mortgage bonds

294
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:14,894
credit default swap, that will pay off...

295
00:19:15,924 --> 00:19:18,434
If the underlying... Bond fails.

296
00:19:19,244 --> 00:19:21,204
You want to bet against
the housing market? Yes

297
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:22,615
why?

298
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,194
Those bonds only fail if millions of
Americans don't pay their mortgages.

299
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,285
That's never happened in history.

300
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:31,934
If you'll excuse me Dr. burry,
that seems like a foolish investment.

301
00:19:32,075 --> 00:19:37,174
Based on... prevailing sentiment of the
market and banks, and popular culture...

302
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:40,285
Yes, it's a foolish investment.
But eh...

303
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:41,805
Everyone's wrong...

304
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:44,585
That's a good one.

305
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:51,164
This is wall-street Dr. burry, if you offer
us free money, we're going to take it

306
00:19:51,285 --> 00:19:55,134
my one concern is, is that.. Eh..
When the bonds fail..

307
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,234
Eh... I want to be certain,

308
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:03,085
of payment,
in case of solvency issues with the bank.

309
00:20:04,174 --> 00:20:05,755
I'm sorry, are you for real?

310
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:09,535
You want to bet against the housing market,
and you're worried we won't pay you?

311
00:20:09,654 --> 00:20:10,744
Yes.. That's correct.

312
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:15,305
<whispers>Listen.. I don't
think this will work...

313
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,744
<whispers>
the market on housing is never gonna crash

314
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:28,805
<whispers>
this is all rock-solid by now

315
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,734
<whispers>
it wouldn't even if we wanted it to.

316
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,875
<whispers>
kinda hard one to deal with...

317
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:37,404
<whispers> Did he awestruck you?
Mmhhhh.

318
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:42,548
Dr burry, we could work
out a pay-as-we-go

319
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,464
structure that would
payout if the bonds fail.

320
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:48,694
It would also apply to your payments
if the value of the mortgage-fund goes up

321
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,664
you'd have to pay us monthly premiums.

322
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,734
Is that acceptable Dr. burry?

323
00:20:56,865 --> 00:20:58,335
Yes.. It is, yes.

324
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:00,795
Em.. I have prospectuses on,

325
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:04,265
six mortgage-backed securities
I want to show you

326
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,194
<whispers> the majority of
them are accepted mortgages.

327
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:40,214
Dr burry, these should be fine!

328
00:21:40,744 --> 00:21:42,835
We're prepared to
sell you 5 million in

329
00:21:42,846 --> 00:21:45,265
credit default swaps on
these mortgage bonds.

330
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:47,904
Can we make it a hundred million?

331
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:52,115
Absolutely! We can make
it one-hundred million.

332
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:57,414
We'll be in touch,
send some paperwork over.

333
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:05,474
I like these cups, could I take one
for my son? Have one, yes, yes!

334
00:22:05,595 --> 00:22:06,664
Thank you!

335
00:22:07,204 --> 00:22:08,295
Have two!

336
00:22:28,525 --> 00:22:30,845
Is there any way to do two-hundred million?

337
00:22:33,045 --> 00:22:35,224
We can... But are you sure?

338
00:22:36,184 --> 00:22:39,765
Absolutely...
Absolutely, we can!

339
00:22:52,765 --> 00:22:57,085
We do, eh... different projects
we do gardening, we do

340
00:22:57,204 --> 00:22:59,535
the bonds... I'd like to .. Eh...

341
00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:01,884
It's not bad for yourself
to be found extreme

342
00:23:02,105 --> 00:23:03,105
it's very cool!

343
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:38,974
Hey Randall, what with the dom?
Bonuses aren't for three months.

344
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:43,045
We just sold 200 million in
credit-swaps for mortgage-bonds

345
00:23:43,325 --> 00:23:46,694
some fund-manager from California,
fucking crazy right?!

346
00:23:46,815 --> 00:23:48,444
Only way to make money dog!

347
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:50,355
I didn't know there
were swaps on mortgages

348
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:52,984
there are now, we made it for him!

349
00:23:53,255 --> 00:23:56,214
His head must have caught up with his hole
or do something... I don't know.

350
00:23:56,255 --> 00:23:57,964
Want one? No?

351
00:23:58,265 --> 00:23:59,285
Awwwww

352
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:00,555
Jared

353
00:24:00,944 --> 00:24:03,394
did you hear about the deal
that Randall did with some fund-manager?

354
00:24:03,515 --> 00:24:05,694
Randall? Bullshit!

355
00:24:05,924 --> 00:24:08,055
He's a foot-soldier,
I'm sure it's a shit deal.

356
00:24:08,174 --> 00:24:09,174
No, it's for real!

357
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:11,684
I told you we'd meet later.

358
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:14,265
Unfortunately... it's in a place like this,
which I would never be in.

359
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:18,365
I never hung out with these idiots after
work, ever! I had fashion friends.

360
00:24:19,154 --> 00:24:21,884
Apparently this guy wanted
two-hundred mill in credit default swaps.

361
00:24:22,605 --> 00:24:24,404
Randall made the sale,
can you believe it?

362
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:26,664
Somebody shorted two-hundred mill
in mortgage bonds?

363
00:24:26,785 --> 00:24:28,005
That was just with deutsche...

364
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:30,394
Word is... he had half the town.

365
00:24:31,224 --> 00:24:32,224
How much in total?

366
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:33,825
1.3 billion

367
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,055
what?

368
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,934
That's... that's pretty much
all of scion's liquidity!

369
00:24:38,055 --> 00:24:39,744
Michael, that's highly distressing!

370
00:24:40,194 --> 00:24:43,384
Lawrence...
That is not all of our liquidity!

371
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:47,275
And I'm not certain that you
really understand this trade.

372
00:24:47,394 --> 00:24:48,714
This is a certainty.

373
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:51,484
Mike, I consider myself a mentor to you.

374
00:24:52,085 --> 00:24:54,954
But our company is not
comfortable with this investment.

375
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:56,815
Am I being clear? Lawrence

376
00:24:56,934 --> 00:25:01,015
I have full autonomy when it
comes to investment strategy

377
00:25:01,464 --> 00:25:02,605
you can read our agreement.

378
00:25:02,724 --> 00:25:05,474
Do not throw our acception-
agreement in my face Michael!

379
00:25:06,355 --> 00:25:09,575
We had an underlying understanding,
you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man!

380
00:25:09,694 --> 00:25:10,964
This is not crazy...

381
00:25:11,755 --> 00:25:13,085
It's all very logical.

382
00:25:13,204 --> 00:25:15,692
So now we pay up premiums
on these swaps against

383
00:25:15,703 --> 00:25:17,795
housing-market until
the mortgages fail?

384
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:19,785
In other words...

385
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:23,144
We lose millions until something
that has never happened before... happens?

386
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:28,184
That's correct!

387
00:26:01,755 --> 00:26:04,295
Hello mark baum oh hey Cathy!

388
00:26:04,414 --> 00:26:07,325
It wasn't me, I had a personal thing
this afternoon. I'm not your babysitter.

389
00:26:07,444 --> 00:26:09,845
If your appoint makes money for
mark and Sally I'm happy!

390
00:26:09,964 --> 00:26:12,414
Ok... hey did I hear you're expecting?

391
00:26:12,535 --> 00:26:13,815
Eh, we're expecting to be expecting...

392
00:26:13,934 --> 00:26:16,335
I'd be upset clearing this out,
but we're .. That's exciting!

393
00:26:21,075 --> 00:26:22,704
Lump.. In my ball

394
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,994
I'll go in for a scan hmm

395
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:28,934
turns out I have large thing,
called an epididymis

396
00:26:29,394 --> 00:26:31,615
which is a thing that goes around the ball

397
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:33,474
and is like a sack underneath.

398
00:26:33,595 --> 00:26:38,464
I have an extremely pronounced epididymis
enriveted that is.

399
00:26:38,785 --> 00:26:42,335
Almost as large as another
testicle on itself

400
00:26:42,454 --> 00:26:45,025
so get this... Cynthia.. Guys!

401
00:26:45,144 --> 00:26:48,664
Cynthia wants me to quit!
And open a b&b in Vermont.

402
00:26:49,164 --> 00:26:51,954
That's great! I'd love to see mark
baum run a bed and breakfast!

403
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,535
Like: Here's your steel-cut
oatmeal asshole!

404
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,394
Mark refused to kiss the ring
of the people with the checkbooks,

405
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:00,184
so he had to set up his fund
under Morgan Stanley's umbrella.

406
00:27:01,055 --> 00:27:03,974
His small team his...
Distrust of the system.

407
00:27:04,095 --> 00:27:05,605
You guys are sick.. You're sick!

408
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,545
She says, this job is making me unhappy.

409
00:27:07,914 --> 00:27:09,105
But you're happy when you're unhappy!

410
00:27:09,224 --> 00:27:10,384
I am happy when I'm unhappy!

411
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:12,755
Bennie Daniel
you know how to make a muffin?

412
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,295
Mark's numbers guy.

413
00:27:14,414 --> 00:27:16,105
Do you even know how to do laundry?
Make a bed? -Okay!

414
00:27:16,224 --> 00:27:18,714
Bennie lost his father to a
violent crime when he was young

415
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:20,595
just like mark,
he didn't talk about it.

416
00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:22,214
I don't talk about that!

417
00:27:22,335 --> 00:27:24,365
Cynthia's no joke, she could
actually make him move to Vermont!

418
00:27:24,484 --> 00:27:26,125
I mean, she made me start wearing a suit.

419
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:30,305
Porter Collins, former olympic rower,
went to brown.

420
00:27:30,424 --> 00:27:32,105
He worked with baum at
a previous firm, and

421
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,998
couldn't figure out why
no-one listened to baum.

422
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,795
The guy with all the good ideas.

423
00:27:36,164 --> 00:27:38,703
Sir, yeah, I know, do you have the
wrong front-point? Cause there

424
00:27:38,715 --> 00:27:41,036
is another front-point in this
same building that is baum's

425
00:27:41,154 --> 00:27:44,375
and Danny Moses, the optimist of the bunch.

426
00:27:45,085 --> 00:27:46,799
And a hell of a trader,
which is the only

427
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:48,744
reason they put up with
his bullshit optimism.

428
00:27:49,384 --> 00:27:53,404
You're a weird caller, you take longer
with a wrong number than anybody else

429
00:27:53,525 --> 00:27:56,222
I mean... it's this guy...
From... deutsche,

430
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:59,005
who was talking about
shorting housing bonds.

431
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:03,075
And then, in the middle of the call where I
had realized he had the wrong front-point.

432
00:28:03,194 --> 00:28:06,125
And then... and then... cause he
wanted the one on the eighth floor.

433
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:08,164
He wanted to short housing bonds?
Hmmm

434
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:10,674
it happens like five times a day, that
somebody uses the wrong front-point.

435
00:28:10,795 --> 00:28:12,305
We should change our name!

436
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,684
Wait, wait...
He wanted to short housing bonds?

437
00:28:15,075 --> 00:28:16,394
Who bets against housing?

438
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,394
What's the abx at?

439
00:28:19,515 --> 00:28:23,365
What's abx?
- It tracks sub-prime mortgage bond value. -Go back to sleep!

440
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:26,404
The abx is at... eh...

441
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:30,115
Wow! It's down, it's down 3 points
since last year, that's weird.

442
00:28:30,234 --> 00:28:31,605
I haven't heard a peep about that!

443
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:35,535
What was this guys name?
Jared vennekt... vennett

444
00:28:35,654 --> 00:28:38,184
that's right!
These lucky sons of bitches caught wind

445
00:28:38,305 --> 00:28:42,025
of one of the best trades in
wall-street history from a wrong number.

446
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:44,795
They should've paid 10 percent
to my fox ticket system.

447
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:46,835
He was Jared vennett, vennett

448
00:28:46,954 --> 00:28:50,555
Jared vennett, from deutsche, sounded
very sketchy. Sounds like a douchebag.

449
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:58,674
<murmuring in himself>

450
00:29:01,424 --> 00:29:04,575
ok.. Hi... how are you?!
Have a seat!

451
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:08,615
Hey mister vennett from deutsche bank,
who do we have?

452
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:20,785
So, how many people have you
talked to about this trade? A few.

453
00:29:21,535 --> 00:29:23,035
There's definitely some interest.

454
00:29:23,154 --> 00:29:23,474
Ohh..

455
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,005
My boss would have my ass

456
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,005
are you crazy jer?

457
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:26,585
Get lost!

458
00:29:26,704 --> 00:29:27,704
Fuck you!

459
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,884
Which is why you're here
talking to us on the wrong number?

460
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:33,444
Sounds like there's a lot of interest.
Alright.

461
00:29:34,154 --> 00:29:37,765
A few people have us in, just to laugh
at me on this deal, is that you?

462
00:29:37,884 --> 00:29:38,765
Is that what this is?

463
00:29:38,884 --> 00:29:41,055
That's not what this is,
that's just how mark is.

464
00:29:41,855 --> 00:29:42,704
Let's see what you got.

465
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:45,305
I'm sorry, do you smell that, what is that?
What?

466
00:29:45,424 --> 00:29:47,575
What's that smell? Cologne?

467
00:29:48,115 --> 00:29:49,724
No...

468
00:29:51,184 --> 00:29:52,375
Opportunity!

469
00:29:52,785 --> 00:29:54,404
No... money.

470
00:29:54,904 --> 00:29:57,285
I smell money...

471
00:29:57,404 --> 00:29:58,404
Chris...

472
00:29:58,724 --> 00:30:00,035
Goddammit! I'm sorry.

473
00:30:03,325 --> 00:30:05,174
This is your basic mortgage bond.

474
00:30:05,585 --> 00:30:07,825
Alright, the originals were simple.

475
00:30:07,944 --> 00:30:11,605
They were just thousands of
AAA-mortgages bundled together,

476
00:30:11,724 --> 00:30:13,565
guaranteed by the us-government.

477
00:30:13,684 --> 00:30:15,325
The modern ones are different.

478
00:30:15,444 --> 00:30:18,994
They're private.
And they're made up of layers of tranches.

479
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:26,174
Highest level AAA's getting paid first.

480
00:30:26,295 --> 00:30:29,105
The lowest rated b's getting paid last,
taking on defaults first.

481
00:30:29,585 --> 00:30:32,285
No obviously if you're buying b's
you could make more money.

482
00:30:32,404 --> 00:30:34,914
But, they're a little risky,
sometimes they fail.

483
00:30:37,184 --> 00:30:38,184
Chris...

484
00:30:42,144 --> 00:30:46,674
Somewhere along the line, these b's and
bb's went from a little risky to dogshit.

485
00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:48,365
Where's the trash?

486
00:30:49,994 --> 00:30:52,414
I'm talking rock-bottom fico-scores.

487
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:55,575
No income-verification.

488
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:58,845
Adjustable rates... Dogshit!

489
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:03,765
The default-rates are already up
from one to four percent fellas.

490
00:31:03,884 --> 00:31:06,434
And if they rise to eight percent...
And they will!

491
00:31:07,164 --> 00:31:09,045
A lot of these bbb's
are going to zero too.

492
00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:11,174
And that... You're too close...

493
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:14,075
Is an opportunity.

494
00:31:14,194 --> 00:31:18,164
Ok, you're saying that at 8 percent the
bonds fail and we're already at 4 percent?

495
00:31:18,285 --> 00:31:20,934
That's right.
If they go to eight... it's armageddon.

496
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:23,954
Yeah that's right.
How come nobody's talking about this?

497
00:31:24,075 --> 00:31:25,684
And you're completely sure of the math?

498
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,125
Look at him...

499
00:31:27,994 --> 00:31:29,214
That's my quant!

500
00:31:29,335 --> 00:31:30,335
Your what?

501
00:31:30,404 --> 00:31:33,694
My quantitative... my maths specialist!
Look at him!

502
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:37,434
You notice anything different about him?
Look at his face!

503
00:31:38,144 --> 00:31:40,575
Look at his eyes!
I'll give you a hint..

504
00:31:40,694 --> 00:31:41,964
His name is Yang!

505
00:31:43,664 --> 00:31:46,545
He won a national maths competition..
In China!

506
00:31:46,924 --> 00:31:48,914
He doesn't even speak English!

507
00:31:49,654 --> 00:31:51,295
Yeah! I'm sure of the math.

508
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:54,744
Actually, my name is jeong,

509
00:31:54,865 --> 00:31:56,734
and... I do speak English

510
00:31:56,855 --> 00:32:00,305
Jared likes to say it though.. Because he
thinks it makes me seem more authentic

511
00:32:00,424 --> 00:32:03,605
and... I got second in that
national math competition

512
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:06,944
so... you're offering us a chance
to short this pile of blocks?

513
00:32:07,065 --> 00:32:08,065
How?

514
00:32:08,515 --> 00:32:11,015
With something called a
credit default swap.

515
00:32:12,045 --> 00:32:16,085
It's like insurance on the bond, and
if it goes bust, you can make 10-to-1.

516
00:32:16,204 --> 00:32:19,835
Even 20-to-1 return,
and it's already slowly going bust.

517
00:32:19,954 --> 00:32:22,375
10-to-1, 20-to-1... No way!

518
00:32:22,494 --> 00:32:24,005
And no-one is paying attention.

519
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,345
No-one is paying attention.

520
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:32,285
Because the banks are too busy getting
paid obscene fees to sell these bonds.

521
00:32:32,404 --> 00:32:33,825
But wait... you are the bank

522
00:32:33,944 --> 00:32:37,134
you work for the bank,
I bet your margins are pretty nice and fat.

523
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,184
Let's not talk about my margins by the way.

524
00:32:39,845 --> 00:32:42,654
Being nice and fat... that's a nice
shirt, do they make it for men?

525
00:32:43,355 --> 00:32:44,224
Aren't you the bank?

526
00:32:44,345 --> 00:32:45,345
I work for the bank!

527
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,174
I don't think like a bank

528
00:32:47,295 --> 00:32:49,375
big banks, small bank...
I like to make money.

529
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:52,095
Alright...
Let me put it this way...

530
00:32:52,335 --> 00:32:54,015
I'm standing in front of a burning house,

531
00:32:54,134 --> 00:32:56,765
and I'm offering you fire insurance on it

532
00:32:57,005 --> 00:32:59,515
how can these underlying bonds be...
As bad as you say?

533
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:00,634
It wouldn't be legal!

534
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,325
Nobody knows what's in them!

535
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:04,454
Nobody knows, what's in the bonds,

536
00:33:04,575 --> 00:33:07,255
I've seen some that are
65 percent AAA-rating.

537
00:33:07,664 --> 00:33:12,115
That I know, for a fact, are filled
with 95 percent sub-prime shit.

538
00:33:12,234 --> 00:33:13,914
With fico's below 550

539
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:15,085
get the fuck out of here!

540
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:16,375
Want me to really blow your mind?

541
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,615
When the market deems a bond too risky
to buy, what do you think we do with it?

542
00:33:20,404 --> 00:33:21,704
Take a guess! Wi don't

543
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:23,065
I don't know, you tell me!

544
00:33:23,345 --> 00:33:24,164
Alright...

545
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:26,535
You think we just warehouse
it on the books?

546
00:33:26,654 --> 00:33:29,805
No, we just repackage it,
with a bunch of other shit that didn't sell

547
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,525
and put it into a cdo.

548
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:34,434
A cdo? Yes... a cdo.

549
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:35,555
What is that? W

550
00:33:35,704 --> 00:33:38,664
where we take a bunch of
b's, bb's and bbb's that haven't sold,

551
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:40,454
and we put em in a pile...

552
00:33:42,255 --> 00:33:46,505
And when the pile gets large enough, the
whole is suddenly considered 'diversified'.

553
00:33:46,914 --> 00:33:48,845
And then... the whores
of the rating agency,

554
00:33:48,964 --> 00:33:53,134
give it a 92 / 93 percent AAA-rating,
no questions asked...

555
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:57,424
Holy... what! Say that again!

556
00:33:58,295 --> 00:33:59,954
Collateralized debt obligations

557
00:34:00,555 --> 00:34:03,075
it's important to understand, because
it's what allowed the housing crisis

558
00:34:03,194 --> 00:34:05,565
become a nationwide economic disaster.

559
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:09,784
Here's world-famous chef
Anthony bourdain to explain.

560
00:34:14,164 --> 00:34:17,815
Ok, I'm a chef on a Sunday-afternoon
setting the menu of a big restaurant.

561
00:34:17,934 --> 00:34:22,085
I ordered my fish on Friday, which is the
mortgage bond that Michael burry shorted.

562
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:24,315
But... some of the fresh doesn't sell..

563
00:34:24,434 --> 00:34:26,085
I don't know why, maybe it just came out,

564
00:34:26,204 --> 00:34:27,755
how Anthony has the
intelligence of a dolphin.

565
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,505
So... what am I gonna do?

566
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:33,974
Throw all this unsold fish, which is
the bbb-level of bond, in the garbage?

567
00:34:34,094 --> 00:34:35,125
And take the loss?

568
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:37,844
No way!

569
00:34:37,864 --> 00:34:40,235
Being a crafty and
morally honorous chef that I am...

570
00:34:40,355 --> 00:34:44,844
Every crappy levels of the bond I don't
sell... I throw into a seafood stew.

571
00:34:45,114 --> 00:34:48,644
It's not old fish!
It's a whole new thing!

572
00:34:48,764 --> 00:34:51,614
The best part is...
They're eating retailed Halibut!

573
00:34:52,385 --> 00:34:54,175
That... is a cdo.

574
00:34:54,295 --> 00:34:57,164
I just need to know
how these could possibly be correlated.

575
00:34:57,525 --> 00:34:59,456
You're like d-d-
dora the explorering,

576
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:01,704
you're the first person
who has found this...

577
00:35:01,824 --> 00:35:04,094
So.. Hold on..
So mortgage bonds are dogshit?

578
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:06,855
Cdo's are dogshit wrapped in catshit.

579
00:35:07,885 --> 00:35:09,474
Yeah... that's right!

580
00:35:09,864 --> 00:35:13,324
Institutions treat these cdo's like
they're as solid as treasury bonds.

581
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,425
And they're going to zero..

582
00:35:15,844 --> 00:35:17,951
No, that can't be right,
there, there, are 500

583
00:35:17,963 --> 00:35:20,034
billion in housing bonds
sold last year alone

584
00:35:20,155 --> 00:35:23,344
ratings agencies, the banks...
The fucking government?

585
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:25,565
You're saying they're all
asleep at the wheel?

586
00:35:25,684 --> 00:35:29,144
Yeah!
My whole department is long on this stuff.

587
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:31,795
They call me chicken little.

588
00:35:32,635 --> 00:35:34,315
They call me bubble-boy.

589
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,344
A's... zero.

590
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:41,855
B's.. Zero, bb's... zero.

591
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:43,945
Bbb's... zero.

592
00:35:45,974 --> 00:35:47,304
And then that happens!

593
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:48,824
What... is that?

594
00:35:51,005 --> 00:35:52,925
That's America's housing market.

595
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:57,764
Thank you. Fucking a Jared!

596
00:35:57,885 --> 00:35:59,655
Shut your fucking mouth!

597
00:36:12,994 --> 00:36:14,855
Bye Jared!

598
00:36:20,605 --> 00:36:21,755
I don't like it!

599
00:36:23,195 --> 00:36:24,494
He's playing us.

600
00:36:25,724 --> 00:36:29,175
He's playing us, he's got too much skin in
the game, and he's dumping his position.

601
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,594
What if he's right?

602
00:36:32,074 --> 00:36:34,414
You want him to be right!
Yes, I do!

603
00:36:35,034 --> 00:36:38,614
The banks have given us twenty-five percent
interest rates on credit cards.

604
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:41,675
They have screwed us on student-loans,
so we can never get out from under.

605
00:36:41,795 --> 00:36:45,144
Then this guy, walks
into my office and says:

606
00:36:45,525 --> 00:36:48,264
"Those same banks got greedy,
they lost track of the market"

607
00:36:48,385 --> 00:36:50,614
and I can profit off of their stupidity

608
00:36:50,735 --> 00:36:52,224
fuck! Yeah!
I want him to be right!

609
00:36:52,735 --> 00:36:56,135
I mean, how come you don't hate this guy?
He's everything you taught us not to trust!

610
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:59,844
You can't hate him! He is so transparent in
his self-interest that I kinda respect him.

611
00:37:00,264 --> 00:37:02,204
Would I buy a car from him?...
No!

612
00:37:03,824 --> 00:37:07,324
Is he right about the mortgage market?
Let's find out. Let's find out!

613
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,704
Look... it's two very simple questions:

614
00:37:11,074 --> 00:37:14,514
Is there a housing bubble? And if there
is... how exposed are the banks?

615
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,644
Let's get on this quickly too,
because if he is right...

616
00:37:19,144 --> 00:37:22,505
Every loser with a couple million bucks
in a fund is gonna be jumping on us.

617
00:37:23,114 --> 00:37:24,114
Let's go!

618
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:35,335
J.P. Morgan-chase, j.P. Morgan-chase.

619
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:39,445
Ok.. don't!...
Stop saying j.P. Morgan-chase!

620
00:37:39,565 --> 00:37:41,074
I got a good feeling about this

621
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:43,965
just a meeting though, you know...
It's just a meeting!

622
00:37:44,974 --> 00:37:46,914
People have meetings all the time...
You know!

623
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:48,954
People drink their coffee,
they have a meeting...

624
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:50,934
Brownfield funds? Yes! Yes!

625
00:37:51,215 --> 00:37:54,414
Hello, hey!
Chris... I'm on Ted's desk.

626
00:37:54,534 --> 00:37:58,074
I'm Charlie, I'm Charlie geller,
I'm Jamie, Jamie shipley.. Hi!

627
00:37:58,195 --> 00:38:02,054
We're so excited to get setup
on your trading platform!

628
00:38:02,175 --> 00:38:03,914
Here, eh.. Have a seat a second.

629
00:38:04,675 --> 00:38:05,704
Alright!

630
00:38:06,925 --> 00:38:09,914
So I... Ted did ask ehm..
To do us some meeting in front.

631
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:12,775
But I eh... I couldn't find
any marketing material on you guys..

632
00:38:13,414 --> 00:38:16,344
Oh... we just moved here from Boulder.

633
00:38:16,855 --> 00:38:18,695
Oh, can we see some of
your offering documents?

634
00:38:18,914 --> 00:38:21,414
Well brownfield has it own... money...

635
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:23,744
It's our money... yeah.

636
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,025
Well can you tell us how much you manage?

637
00:38:26,144 --> 00:38:29,295
Of course!
We're doing 30 million right now... eh...

638
00:38:29,414 --> 00:38:33,255
But we started four years ago,
with a hundred-ten thousand.

639
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:34,835
Wow! So as you can see,

640
00:38:35,054 --> 00:38:38,344
that's pretty phenomenal returns.

641
00:38:38,465 --> 00:38:40,914
We wanna get an
isda-agreement with j.P. Morgan,

642
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:43,235
so we can deal in long-term options.

643
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:46,264
That's really cool! Yeah!

644
00:38:58,414 --> 00:38:59,994
That is so cool!

645
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:01,465
Thank you!

646
00:39:01,534 --> 00:39:05,655
But eh.. You guys are under
the capitol requirements for an isda.

647
00:39:06,295 --> 00:39:07,315
By how much?

648
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,034
Er.. How much eh...

649
00:39:09,155 --> 00:39:11,605
One billion four-hundred-seventy millions

650
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,724
so...

651
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:14,085
A lot!

652
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,485
This makes us look bad doesn't it?

653
00:39:17,574 --> 00:39:20,565
That we didn't know
what the capitol requirements were.

654
00:39:20,684 --> 00:39:21,684
I... eh..

655
00:39:22,244 --> 00:39:23,625
It's not great!

656
00:39:24,284 --> 00:39:25,284
But, eh...

657
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,775
Keep up those returns

658
00:39:26,894 --> 00:39:29,994
and give us a call
way down the line you know?

659
00:39:30,114 --> 00:39:30,815
Ok?

660
00:39:30,934 --> 00:39:32,585
Ok, of course! Thanks Chris!

661
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,394
Have a good one guys!
Thank you Chris!

662
00:39:38,474 --> 00:39:39,525
Shit!

663
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:45,405
Who the fuck schedules
a meeting at 4:50 in the afternoon?

664
00:39:46,545 --> 00:39:50,005
Dude, b of a and bear
didn't even return our calls

665
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:53,744
and even fucking morkovia blew us off!
I know man!

666
00:39:54,014 --> 00:39:58,355
Here's the prospectuses of all the other
losers who didn't make it past the lobby.

667
00:39:58,644 --> 00:39:59,835
I don't think I can do this anymore..

668
00:39:59,954 --> 00:40:02,735
Yo, I'm young yet,
I can still do something with my life!

669
00:40:03,094 --> 00:40:05,614
I miss Colorado anyway.
The weed's better!

670
00:40:06,094 --> 00:40:08,324
Gentleman... I need you to leave!

671
00:40:08,445 --> 00:40:09,824
Yep, yeah we're going, let's go!

672
00:40:09,945 --> 00:40:11,414
Look at this, look at this!

673
00:40:11,855 --> 00:40:15,244
This guy says that the
housing market is a giant bubble!

674
00:40:17,925 --> 00:40:19,985
Ok, so this part isn't totally accurate.

675
00:40:20,255 --> 00:40:22,438
Now, we didn't find Jared
vennett's housing bubble

676
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:24,344
pitch in a lobby of a
bank that rejected us.

677
00:40:24,565 --> 00:40:27,934
Truth is... ehm..
A friend had told Charlie about it

678
00:40:28,054 --> 00:40:30,244
and I read about it,
in grand central's trade observer.

679
00:40:30,364 --> 00:40:31,434
This is crazy!

680
00:40:31,835 --> 00:40:34,744
This is... crazy stuff!

681
00:40:34,864 --> 00:40:36,824
Here, they're saying that
there's 10-to-1 returns,

682
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:40,184
on credit default swaps
for mortgage backed securities

683
00:40:40,934 --> 00:40:43,505
and the whole housing market
is about to collapse.

684
00:40:44,114 --> 00:40:46,353
For Jamie and Charlie,
the housing market

685
00:40:46,364 --> 00:40:48,775
doomsday prediction was
music to their ears!

686
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:58,364
They had started working
out of Jamie's garage,

687
00:40:58,485 --> 00:41:02,675
with a 110 thousand Jamie had saved taking
sailboats up and down the east-coast.

688
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:06,164
Our investment-strategy was simple.

689
00:41:06,284 --> 00:41:08,436
People hate to think about
bad things happening

690
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:10,565
so they always underestimate
their likelihood.

691
00:41:10,684 --> 00:41:12,744
Their strategy simple and brilliant.

692
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:14,795
What he said!

693
00:41:14,914 --> 00:41:17,313
Jamie and Charlie found:
Markets will sell options

694
00:41:17,326 --> 00:41:19,784
very cheaply on things they
think will never happen.

695
00:41:19,905 --> 00:41:22,905
So, when they were wrong, they were wrong
small. But when they were right...

696
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:24,994
They were right big! Boooooom!

697
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:33,925
Within a few years they had turned
a 110 grand into 30 million

698
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:38,445
then it was time to go to New York City,
and so far... it wasn't going very well

699
00:41:38,565 --> 00:41:40,014
so what if it does seem interesting?

700
00:41:40,135 --> 00:41:42,235
Nope, no bank will give us our isda.

701
00:41:42,355 --> 00:41:44,045
We're dead in the water...

702
00:41:45,585 --> 00:41:48,074
These kind of trades are
totally out of the question!

703
00:41:48,195 --> 00:41:49,644
We gotta call Ben!

704
00:41:50,864 --> 00:41:51,945
Pffff

705
00:41:52,065 --> 00:41:53,554
call Ben!

706
00:41:54,275 --> 00:41:57,155
Ben ricker was a former trader
in Singapore for chase.

707
00:41:57,275 --> 00:41:59,105
Quit the whole game in disgust!

708
00:41:59,224 --> 00:42:01,824
He just happened to be Jamie's
neighbor when they were in Colorado

709
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:03,644
they met, walking dogs...

710
00:42:03,925 --> 00:42:05,244
But Ben was dark...

711
00:42:05,494 --> 00:42:07,375
He didn't just think
the whole system would fail

712
00:42:07,554 --> 00:42:09,364
he thought the whole world
was going down!

713
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,875
This salad's... oh.. Hmmm good!

714
00:42:11,994 --> 00:42:14,545
You know, every one of these
vegetables is fresh from my garden

715
00:42:16,644 --> 00:42:17,844
you guys should start your own garden!

716
00:42:17,965 --> 00:42:20,755
What you gotta do is
get your soil off petrol chemicals,

717
00:42:21,335 --> 00:42:25,364
use wood-ash and urine, help destroy
the soil, creates mono-nitrate,

718
00:42:25,485 --> 00:42:27,275
seeds are gonna be the new currency!

719
00:42:27,394 --> 00:42:29,829
And not those frankenseeds
from monsanto, I'm

720
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,074
talking about good
healthy organic seeds.

721
00:42:32,195 --> 00:42:34,644
Make yourself a garden, learn to live
off the land! A fucking lunatic!

722
00:42:34,764 --> 00:42:36,784
Ben had real experience in a big bank,

723
00:42:36,905 --> 00:42:40,554
Jamie and Charlie, never even been
in a Manhattan bank bathroom!

724
00:42:40,784 --> 00:42:44,045
But Ben was done with the banking world,
he was very clear!

725
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:45,925
Do you realize that?
Alright, let's crunch some numbers,

726
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:48,434
then maybe we'll talk about calling Ben
I don't wanna crunch the numbers,

727
00:42:48,554 --> 00:42:50,784
when haven't we crunched the numbers?
Seriously guys!

728
00:42:50,905 --> 00:42:53,625
I need you out of here
of course, yes mam!2

729
00:42:53,744 --> 00:42:55,994
one second!
We're going, we're going!

730
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:00,414
Oh God, I hate this!
This is a total waste of time!

731
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:02,264
Come on! Would you relax!

732
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:06,614
I think this is a housing development
about forty-five minutes outside of town.

733
00:43:06,735 --> 00:43:08,364
Mark wants us to check that out first.

734
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:10,644
I hope there's some
Cuban restaurants on the way there,

735
00:43:10,715 --> 00:43:13,144
because I heard the
Cuban food is amazing in Miami.

736
00:43:13,335 --> 00:43:15,974
Please don't be chipper
in the face of me being miserable!

737
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,655
It really makes me hate you!

738
00:43:17,775 --> 00:43:20,724
How is wanting to eat good food,
being chipper?

739
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:23,644
Hello?

740
00:43:24,295 --> 00:43:26,005
Hello?

741
00:43:53,355 --> 00:43:54,704
What's up man? What do you want?

742
00:43:58,465 --> 00:43:58,605
Hello, I'm surveying mortgage owners
who are over 90 days delinquent

743
00:43:58,625 --> 00:44:00,344
I'm looking for a Harvey humpsy

744
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,344
you want my landlord's dog?

745
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:07,186
Your landlord filled out his
mortgage application using his dogs name?

746
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:09,605
I guess so!

747
00:44:09,965 --> 00:44:12,403
Wait, has that asshole not been
paying his mortgage?

748
00:44:12,405 --> 00:44:13,884
Coz, I've been paying my rent!

749
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:15,905
Well, yeah he is over 90 days delinquent

750
00:44:16,184 --> 00:44:17,324
seriously man!

751
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:18,985
Am I gonna have to leave?

752
00:44:22,344 --> 00:44:24,425
My kids just got setup in this school man!

753
00:44:27,485 --> 00:44:29,744
Hey... how are ya?

754
00:44:30,144 --> 00:44:32,103
Ehm.. You should talk to
your landlord about that

755
00:44:32,105 --> 00:44:34,704
I'm sorry I don't have anymore information,
but you ehm...

756
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:36,505
You have a great day!

757
00:44:41,065 --> 00:44:44,025
Seriously... is everything gonna be ok?

758
00:44:44,344 --> 00:44:46,625
You should call...
You should call him!

759
00:44:47,525 --> 00:44:48,605
You should give him a call!

760
00:44:48,744 --> 00:44:50,344
It's not my fault dude!
I've been paying!

761
00:44:54,385 --> 00:44:55,385
Hello!

762
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:01,164
I think somebody just left

763
00:45:02,585 --> 00:45:04,364
all they took was the TV.

764
00:45:04,945 --> 00:45:06,105
It's weird!

765
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:09,085
They didn't even clean up the counter

766
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:19,184
oh, God!

767
00:45:30,525 --> 00:45:31,965
It's like chernobyl!

768
00:45:32,684 --> 00:45:35,385
It's like a hundred houses,
it can't be four people living here.

769
00:45:37,844 --> 00:45:39,885
No, fuck that! Shit!

770
00:45:55,164 --> 00:45:56,965
He's been there for seven hours

771
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,465
what is he looking at?
I heard he had a breakdown!

772
00:45:59,644 --> 00:46:01,704
Just let him is what I think.

773
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:05,085
Dr. burry's office

774
00:46:05,364 --> 00:46:08,324
no, he actually prefers that
you e-mail him. Excuse me!

775
00:46:13,784 --> 00:46:14,804
Hey Lawrence!

776
00:46:17,224 --> 00:46:22,885
We have no confidence in your ability
to identify macro-economic trends.

777
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:26,925
You flew here to tell me that?
Why?

778
00:46:27,264 --> 00:46:30,224
Every, e-e-anyone
can see there's a real-estate bubble

779
00:46:30,885 --> 00:46:34,025
actually no-one can see a bubble,
that's what makes it a bubble

780
00:46:34,164 --> 00:46:36,164
there's still warns!

781
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:37,945
There are always markers!

782
00:46:38,664 --> 00:46:40,184
Mortgage fraud

783
00:46:41,224 --> 00:46:46,045
quintupled since 2000 and the
average take-home pay is flat, but...

784
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:49,844
Home-prices are soaring, that means
the homes are dead, not assets

785
00:46:49,945 --> 00:46:52,545
so Mike burry of San Jose,
a guy who...

786
00:46:52,885 --> 00:46:56,125
Gets his haircut at supercuts,
and doesn't wear shoes,

787
00:46:56,445 --> 00:46:59,005
knows more than Alan greenspan
and Hank Paulson...

788
00:47:00,965 --> 00:47:03,764
I haven't talked to Hank,
but yes he does.

789
00:47:05,085 --> 00:47:09,204
That's cute, that's cute!
Are you being sarcastic with us Mike?

790
00:47:12,244 --> 00:47:15,945
Lawrence...
I don't know how to be sarcastic!

791
00:47:17,005 --> 00:47:18,244
I don't know how to be funny

792
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:21,844
I don't know how to...
Work people..

793
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,324
I just know how to read numbers!

794
00:47:25,824 --> 00:47:27,885
How big is your short position right now?

795
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:29,545
Eh...

796
00:47:29,925 --> 00:47:31,704
1.3 billion

797
00:47:31,965 --> 00:47:32,985
and the premiums?

798
00:47:33,164 --> 00:47:35,905
Eh, we pay... eh... roughly...

799
00:47:35,965 --> 00:47:37,565
80 to 90 million

800
00:47:38,784 --> 00:47:42,485
each year, which is surprising,
because I was the first to do this trade

801
00:47:42,545 --> 00:47:45,684
watch, it will pay!
I may have been early, but I'm not wrong!

802
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:48,704
It's the same thing!
It's the same thing Mike!

803
00:47:48,965 --> 00:47:52,925
You're managing a fund of what?
555 million?

804
00:47:53,744 --> 00:47:57,105
In six years,
it will all be gone!

805
00:47:58,025 --> 00:47:59,025
On one bet

806
00:48:00,105 --> 00:48:02,885
the second quarter of '07
is when the adjustable rates kick in!

807
00:48:03,025 --> 00:48:04,684
The defaults will skyrocket!

808
00:48:05,244 --> 00:48:06,244
Says you!

809
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:10,304
How much is eligible for withdrawal before
they're due? Say in the next two quarters.

810
00:48:11,344 --> 00:48:13,085
If your investors panic

811
00:48:17,085 --> 00:48:18,864
302

812
00:48:19,945 --> 00:48:21,264
my God Mike!

813
00:48:26,324 --> 00:48:29,005
No-one will pull out,
that would be suicide man

814
00:48:29,105 --> 00:48:33,105
down 17 percent for the year,
but if they trust me, and they trust me!

815
00:48:33,184 --> 00:48:35,864
No-one trusts you!

816
00:48:35,965 --> 00:48:38,885
No-one!
I've sent several emails to my investors

817
00:48:38,985 --> 00:48:40,385
letting them know that the.. The...

818
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:45,885
It's the second quarter of '07
is when our housing position shows returns

819
00:48:48,005 --> 00:48:50,184
and ehm... I've been very clear!

820
00:48:50,784 --> 00:48:53,224
People will withdraw their money!

821
00:48:54,025 --> 00:48:57,545
Why? You'd have to be so stupid!

822
00:48:57,724 --> 00:49:01,224
If, if if the funds capitol
drops too much...

823
00:49:01,445 --> 00:49:04,744
Then the swaps contracts are voided

824
00:49:04,844 --> 00:49:06,184
and then the banks...

825
00:49:07,105 --> 00:49:10,144
Get to keep all of it, all of it!

826
00:49:10,264 --> 00:49:11,644
The contracts are voided?

827
00:49:12,505 --> 00:49:14,085
The contracts are voided!?!

828
00:49:15,344 --> 00:49:16,764
Holy shit!

829
00:49:17,324 --> 00:49:18,605
O, motherfucker!

830
00:49:18,844 --> 00:49:19,844
Michael...

831
00:49:20,784 --> 00:49:22,045
Give me my money back.

832
00:49:25,905 --> 00:49:29,045
Michael, do you hear me?
I want my money back!

833
00:49:31,864 --> 00:49:33,465
Give me my fucking money back!

834
00:49:35,204 --> 00:49:36,324
You motherfucker!

835
00:49:37,505 --> 00:49:40,864
The market is in an itsybitsy
little gully right now

836
00:49:40,985 --> 00:49:44,885
like everybody said: "Ok, that was
crazy, let's just all calm down!"

837
00:49:46,864 --> 00:49:50,545
I sold that house for 350,
the year it was built.

838
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:55,704
Two years later... 480, then 585,
maybe eighteen months ago.

839
00:49:56,204 --> 00:49:59,164
This couple bought it for 650 last year!

840
00:49:59,565 --> 00:50:02,204
He'd let it go for that...
I don't

841
00:50:04,405 --> 00:50:06,164
it will break his heart,
but he'll let it go

842
00:50:06,284 --> 00:50:07,405
why is he selling?

843
00:50:07,965 --> 00:50:09,764
Neither one is working right now

844
00:50:10,804 --> 00:50:12,985
surely, they're motivated right?

845
00:50:13,704 --> 00:50:16,364
As motivated as one can be
in this neighborhood.

846
00:50:16,824 --> 00:50:19,565
This house on the left,
I'd say they're properly motivated.

847
00:50:19,605 --> 00:50:21,364
Wow!
A lot of people seem very motivated.

848
00:50:21,664 --> 00:50:25,324
It's just a gully that's all.
Just nerves

849
00:50:26,144 --> 00:50:27,644
so... where do we stand?

850
00:50:28,764 --> 00:50:30,445
I need to talk to my wife

851
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,824
ehm.. This market will last!

852
00:50:33,005 --> 00:50:36,764
Actually, can I talk to a mortgage broker?
Anybody you recommend? Anybody you like?

853
00:50:36,885 --> 00:50:38,625
Yes, yes,
there's someone, absolutely!

854
00:50:38,945 --> 00:50:41,525
Yeah, bitch better like me,
sent her ass to cabo!

855
00:50:43,065 --> 00:50:46,105
So is Morgan Stanley recruiting us?
Is that..

856
00:50:46,184 --> 00:50:49,025
No, eh no.
The bank owns our hedge-fund

857
00:50:49,105 --> 00:50:52,905
we're not really a part of it,
we invest in financial service companies.

858
00:50:52,985 --> 00:50:55,585
We're trying to understand the
residential mortgage business.

859
00:50:55,664 --> 00:50:57,824
How many loans do you write each month?

860
00:50:58,664 --> 00:51:00,105
I don't know, about six

861
00:51:00,244 --> 00:51:01,465
what was it four years ago?

862
00:51:02,824 --> 00:51:05,505
Ten... but maybe fifteen.

863
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:07,664
I was a bartender,
now I own a boat!

864
00:51:08,804 --> 00:51:11,965
So, how many of these are eh..
Adjustable rate mortgages?

865
00:51:12,184 --> 00:51:13,184
Well, most.

866
00:51:14,085 --> 00:51:15,945
Yeah, I'd say about ninety percent

867
00:51:16,264 --> 00:51:19,164
the bonuses on those
skyrocketed a few years ago

868
00:51:19,324 --> 00:51:20,684
adjustables are bread and honey

869
00:51:20,764 --> 00:51:22,985
so, do applicants ever get rejected?

870
00:51:27,525 --> 00:51:28,545
Seriously?

871
00:51:29,525 --> 00:51:31,445
Look if they get rejected
I suck at my job!

872
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,184
Even if they have no money?

873
00:51:33,364 --> 00:51:36,244
Well, my firm offers a ninja loan.

874
00:51:36,525 --> 00:51:41,284
No income no job application, I just leave
the income-section blank if I want.

875
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:42,445
Corporate doesn't care.

876
00:51:42,764 --> 00:51:46,065
These people just want homes,
and they go with the flow.

877
00:51:46,784 --> 00:51:48,324
Your companies don't verify?

878
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,945
If I write a loan on Friday afternoon,

879
00:51:54,885 --> 00:51:56,525
big bank is gonna buy it by Monday lunch.

880
00:51:57,264 --> 00:51:58,545
Deal! Same here!

881
00:52:00,445 --> 00:52:02,704
Could you hold on a second? Yeah

882
00:52:08,885 --> 00:52:11,344
I don't get it...
Why are they confessing?

883
00:52:11,744 --> 00:52:15,125
They're not confessing...
They're bragging!

884
00:52:24,304 --> 00:52:28,085
Do people have any idea
what they are buying?

885
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,463
I focus on immigrants!

886
00:52:31,465 --> 00:52:33,186
Once they find out they're
getting homeless..

887
00:52:33,197 --> 00:52:34,717
They'll sign where
you tell em to sign.

888
00:52:34,824 --> 00:52:37,244
They don't ask questions,
don't understand the rates.

889
00:52:38,605 --> 00:52:40,105
And you target them with red soup?

890
00:52:40,605 --> 00:52:43,164
Their credit actually
isn't bad enough for him.

891
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:46,324
Look I'm a yield guy

892
00:52:49,204 --> 00:52:51,724
I make two thousand on a fixed rate prime

893
00:52:52,724 --> 00:52:56,105
but I can make ten thousand on
a sub-prime adjustable

894
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:58,864
trust me, I'm not driving that
7-series without strippers

895
00:52:59,425 --> 00:53:02,405
no-one on the pole has good credit,
and they're all cash-rich.

896
00:53:06,804 --> 00:53:07,885
Who's Warren buffett?

897
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:11,965
Ok, so, strippers...
Like exotic dancers...

898
00:53:12,465 --> 00:53:13,545
Nude, 'n all...

899
00:53:13,764 --> 00:53:14,425
Topless..

900
00:53:14,505 --> 00:53:16,204
Strippers? Yeah, hmmmm.

901
00:53:20,025 --> 00:53:21,945
Can you introduce us? Yes!

902
00:53:22,505 --> 00:53:23,505
Yes!

903
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:29,045
I always get option to pay adjustable.
I'm a private contractor.

904
00:53:29,244 --> 00:53:30,405
Can't hear you, I'm sorry!

905
00:53:30,545 --> 00:53:32,666
I always get option to
pay adjustable, I'm a

906
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:34,764
private contractor, I
need the flexibility.

907
00:53:34,824 --> 00:53:37,224
And you tell the mortgage
company what you do?

908
00:53:37,284 --> 00:53:38,724
I write: Therapist

909
00:53:39,324 --> 00:53:41,105
you can touch me! Always?

910
00:53:41,605 --> 00:53:42,824
Only in v.I.P.

911
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:45,344
No, no, no you say
you always do adjustables

912
00:53:45,425 --> 00:53:47,364
and you have more than
one loan on a property?

913
00:53:47,405 --> 00:53:48,644
Everybody does!

914
00:53:48,764 --> 00:53:50,525
At least down here
I'm sorry what?

915
00:53:50,664 --> 00:53:53,405
Everybody does!
At least down here

916
00:53:53,445 --> 00:53:55,304
that way you'll only put
down like five percent

917
00:53:55,445 --> 00:53:57,545
well prices have leveled off though, right?

918
00:53:57,605 --> 00:53:59,204
Yeah, it's a gully

919
00:53:59,585 --> 00:54:02,784
would you mind not moving anymore?
I'll still pay you!

920
00:54:06,985 --> 00:54:09,585
Sorry... We're not alone.

921
00:54:09,724 --> 00:54:12,465
Ok, look..
If home-prices don't go up,

922
00:54:12,545 --> 00:54:14,625
you are not going to be able to refinance

923
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:16,264
and you're going to be stuck paying

924
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:20,525
whatever your monthly payment is once it
jumps up, whenever your tisa-rate expires

925
00:54:21,144 --> 00:54:23,485
your monthly's could go up
two-to three hundred percent!

926
00:54:23,684 --> 00:54:25,485
James says I can always refinance!

927
00:54:25,664 --> 00:54:27,625
Well... he's... a liar.

928
00:54:27,804 --> 00:54:30,925
Actually in this particular case,
James probably is wrong.

929
00:54:31,005 --> 00:54:32,945
Two-hundred percent?

930
00:54:33,525 --> 00:54:34,525
On all my loans?

931
00:54:34,565 --> 00:54:38,324
What do you mean? We're talking
about two loans on one house right?

932
00:54:38,804 --> 00:54:40,704
I have five houses

933
00:54:40,965 --> 00:54:42,085
and a condo..

934
00:54:44,684 --> 00:54:45,684
Hey, there's a bubble!

935
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:47,344
How do you know?

936
00:54:47,465 --> 00:54:48,684
Trust me. Call vennett,

937
00:54:48,764 --> 00:54:50,844
buy 50 million in swabs on the nbs

938
00:54:50,905 --> 00:54:53,565
what do we got?
Garibaldi's are bbb!

939
00:54:54,085 --> 00:54:55,085
Mark, are you sure?

940
00:54:55,704 --> 00:54:57,445
Yeah, yeah! It's time to call bullshit!

941
00:54:57,525 --> 00:54:58,465
Bullshit on what?

942
00:54:58,465 --> 00:54:59,905
Every fucking thing!

943
00:55:27,864 --> 00:55:29,744
Is this America's angriest hedge-fund?

944
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:32,324
Hi listen, I got one last question for you

945
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:34,324
how are you fucking us?

946
00:55:36,565 --> 00:55:38,164
There's a nice way to say that Vinnie...

947
00:55:38,204 --> 00:55:39,204
I'm serious

948
00:55:39,985 --> 00:55:42,784
we'll buy your swaps,
but only if you say how you're fucking us.

949
00:55:43,224 --> 00:55:45,405
I'm not fucking you Vinnie,
I'm kissing you

950
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:48,605
I'm looking deep into your eyes
as I make love to you Vinnie.

951
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:51,784
I'm handing you the deal
of the century on a fucking platter!

952
00:55:52,065 --> 00:55:53,065
What do I get out of it?

953
00:55:53,324 --> 00:55:56,864
Easy..
I got a 20 million a month negative carrier

954
00:55:56,965 --> 00:55:58,650
I got bosses trying to
pull the plug, because

955
00:55:58,661 --> 00:56:00,342
they're thinking I'm
out of my fucking mind

956
00:56:00,985 --> 00:56:01,565
alright?

957
00:56:01,804 --> 00:56:05,184
We make this trade,
those problems aren't so big anymore

958
00:56:05,724 --> 00:56:07,885
and sure... swaps are a dark market so...

959
00:56:08,105 --> 00:56:10,644
I set the price, whatever price I want.

960
00:56:10,804 --> 00:56:13,784
And when you come for the payday,
I'm gonna rip your eyes out

961
00:56:13,965 --> 00:56:15,545
I'm gonna make a fortune

962
00:56:15,684 --> 00:56:17,465
but the good news is Vinnie,
you're not gonna care

963
00:56:17,605 --> 00:56:19,525
cause you're going to make
so much fucking money!

964
00:56:19,704 --> 00:56:20,784
That's what I get out of it

965
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:22,264
wanna know what you get out of it?

966
00:56:22,425 --> 00:56:25,224
You get the ice-cream, the hot-fudge,
the banana and the nuts!

967
00:56:26,184 --> 00:56:27,505
Right now I get the sprinkles

968
00:56:27,565 --> 00:56:29,025
and yeah... if this goes through...

969
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:30,644
I get the cherry.

970
00:56:33,005 --> 00:56:34,105
You get the sundae!

971
00:56:37,005 --> 00:56:38,005
Alright, I'll buy that.

972
00:56:38,784 --> 00:56:39,784
Thank you!

973
00:56:40,045 --> 00:56:41,284
So what do you say?

974
00:56:42,244 --> 00:56:43,664
Want me to make you a market?

975
00:56:44,105 --> 00:56:45,525
We'll take 50 million

976
00:56:45,885 --> 00:56:47,505
garibaldi-4 triple-b

977
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,425
sharpen your pencils,
I'll get the paperwork ready

978
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:55,304
aahhh... fuck you too!

979
00:56:57,344 --> 00:56:58,724
Yes!

980
00:57:01,164 --> 00:57:02,304
That's right!

981
00:57:05,844 --> 00:57:09,764
He has so many numbers,
and I always forget,

982
00:57:10,284 --> 00:57:13,085
which one he prefers, cause he's very
specific! Just pick the first one

983
00:57:13,164 --> 00:57:15,605
I don't know if it's the first one
just try it!

984
00:57:15,905 --> 00:57:16,905
Ok

985
00:57:35,224 --> 00:57:36,144
Ben ricker

986
00:57:36,224 --> 00:57:37,704
hey Ben it's Jamie!

987
00:57:39,525 --> 00:57:41,784
Jamie, you know you're not
supposed to use this line.

988
00:57:43,784 --> 00:57:44,824
Told ya...

989
00:57:46,025 --> 00:57:49,224
Ok, let's try number two out of fourteen.

990
00:58:00,925 --> 00:58:01,945
Ben ricker

991
00:58:02,025 --> 00:58:05,443
Ben, why do you do that man?
You're a retired trader, ok..

992
00:58:05,445 --> 00:58:07,804
No-one is listening to your calls!
The NSA has a 52 billion dollar budget

993
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:11,264
and the ability to tens of millions calls
a second, you think they're not using it?

994
00:58:12,105 --> 00:58:14,925
Ok, I promise I will refrain from saying,

995
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:18,204
Ben ricker and dirty bomb
in the same sentence

996
00:58:19,065 --> 00:58:21,105
Jesus! I'm sorry dude!

997
00:58:22,485 --> 00:58:23,284
Ben ricker

998
00:58:23,485 --> 00:58:25,625
did you get a chance to look at
what we sent you Ben?

999
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:28,065
It's Charlie... I'm here too!

1000
00:58:28,864 --> 00:58:31,244
Hi Charlie, yeah I did, hold on!

1001
00:58:37,204 --> 00:58:38,465
Ben, you still there?

1002
00:58:38,605 --> 00:58:39,605
Yeah

1003
00:58:40,405 --> 00:58:41,525
I'll be honest gentlemen

1004
00:58:42,744 --> 00:58:44,045
you scared the shit out of me!

1005
00:58:44,644 --> 00:58:48,304
That's a good thing right? That means
that this vennett guy is not wrong!

1006
00:58:49,764 --> 00:58:50,764
No, he's not!

1007
00:58:53,744 --> 00:58:54,344
Cool

1008
00:58:54,465 --> 00:58:55,724
tell me more about these cdo's

1009
00:58:56,085 --> 00:59:00,784
yeah yeah, ehm, ok
vennett mentioned the cdo's, but actually,

1010
00:59:01,005 --> 00:59:03,103
we took a look and they're
way worse then even he

1011
00:59:03,114 --> 00:59:05,224
realizes -these things
don't even make sense Ben.

1012
00:59:05,224 --> 00:59:08,664
We can't even model them
it's a hundred times bigger than the nbs

1013
00:59:08,844 --> 00:59:10,405
and ninety percent AAA-rating?

1014
00:59:10,565 --> 00:59:13,505
Yes, over ninety percent
it's incredible!

1015
00:59:13,605 --> 00:59:16,545
Yeah, I took a good hard look at
the cdo's you want to short.

1016
00:59:17,565 --> 00:59:19,664
They're brilliant!
Worthless, total crap!

1017
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:22,985
Jamie, very good!

1018
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:26,505
What can I say.. I, I'm, I'm,
good at finding shit!

1019
00:59:26,545 --> 00:59:31,085
So Ben, we shorted the bb's and the bbb's,
and the risk is relatively low,

1020
00:59:31,565 --> 00:59:33,945
pay-up is like 25-to-1

1021
00:59:36,585 --> 00:59:38,545
ok, so why are you calling me?
I don't do this anymore!

1022
00:59:38,644 --> 00:59:39,644
Look, Ben...

1023
00:59:41,224 --> 00:59:44,005
We need you to help us get the isda.

1024
00:59:44,965 --> 00:59:47,625
If we get a hunting license,
we can short this crap

1025
00:59:47,965 --> 00:59:50,644
we know you hate wall-street,
we're not asking you to do the trading

1026
00:59:50,724 --> 00:59:52,045
we're simply asking you to...

1027
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,664
To help us.

1028
00:59:53,925 --> 00:59:56,585
To get a seat at the fucking table

1029
00:59:58,244 --> 00:59:59,565
it's a pretty ugly table guys

1030
01:00:00,025 --> 01:00:05,065
look Ben, the system fucked up
in a big, big way here, ok?

1031
01:00:05,164 --> 01:00:09,744
And somehow... we, eh..
Know before anyone else.

1032
01:00:10,585 --> 01:00:13,445
You know, this is a
once in a lifetime deal!

1033
01:00:16,304 --> 01:00:17,304
I'm thinking

1034
01:00:22,105 --> 01:00:24,045
ok, I'll call deutsche bank

1035
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:25,525
thank you Ben!

1036
01:00:26,144 --> 01:00:29,405
Oh and bear, what about bear?
They have some apprehensible product!

1037
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:32,485
Ok, bear will trade with anybody!

1038
01:01:21,804 --> 01:01:23,625
I'll see if I can push it through

1039
01:01:23,724 --> 01:01:25,344
and oh, thank Jared for us.

1040
01:02:13,905 --> 01:02:16,025
Hi, it's mark,
I need to talk to Vinnie right now!

1041
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:20,505
Wait a second

1042
01:02:20,605 --> 01:02:24,405
how it is that you are fucking us,
cause what we are seeing here,

1043
01:02:26,684 --> 01:02:28,405
Morgan Stanley building fast!

1044
01:02:28,684 --> 01:02:31,034
Are we all jocks at the
same computer-screens?

1045
01:02:31,045 --> 01:02:32,804
Can we talk to one
person please?

1046
01:02:33,244 --> 01:02:35,164
Ok, yeah.
What do you mean, you're in the tower?

1047
01:02:35,724 --> 01:02:36,764
Vinnie, are you there?

1048
01:02:37,844 --> 01:02:39,664
Mark, are you there? Hello?
Yeah, yeah, did you hear?

1049
01:02:39,844 --> 01:02:41,644
Mortgages defaults have
gone through the roof!

1050
01:02:41,905 --> 01:02:43,425
Anybody jumping off the building yet?

1051
01:02:43,505 --> 01:02:45,405
Why would they?
Sub-prime mortgages are up?

1052
01:02:45,525 --> 01:02:49,905
What? -Vennett wants 1,5 million
more in collateral by-close

1053
01:02:50,065 --> 01:02:51,485
vennett's asking us to post collateral

1054
01:02:51,565 --> 01:02:52,945
what the hell is going on?

1055
01:02:52,985 --> 01:02:54,844
We don't know, but deutsche is
on the phone demanding payment

1056
01:02:54,965 --> 01:02:57,764
call vennett, call that little shit!
Call vennett!

1057
01:02:57,824 --> 01:02:58,824
Tell him to get his ass down here

1058
01:02:58,925 --> 01:03:00,965
so, sub-prime loans go bad,

1059
01:03:01,065 --> 01:03:04,144
but sub-rime bonds, which are made up
of sub-prime loans, are more valuable?

1060
01:03:04,545 --> 01:03:06,603
They want another 1.9
million by market close

1061
01:03:06,605 --> 01:03:08,943
what about the ratings-agencies?
Moody's, s&p?

1062
01:03:08,954 --> 01:03:11,405
Are they downgrading the
cdo's or mortgage bonds

1063
01:03:11,505 --> 01:03:14,244
where are the ratings-agencies at?
They're the fucking same!

1064
01:03:14,405 --> 01:03:15,623
Nope, they're all still AAA!

1065
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,644
What the hell!

1066
01:03:17,164 --> 01:03:20,284
Are you fucking kidding me?
Those fuckers, those motherfuckers!

1067
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:23,284
They go public and all the care about
is their bottom-line and their shit!

1068
01:03:23,344 --> 01:03:24,784
Mark, that's not all...

1069
01:03:25,425 --> 01:03:28,125
The Morgan Stanley risk-guys are here
they called in Kathy tao

1070
01:03:28,224 --> 01:03:30,344
I'm trying to convince her
to make her sell us swaps

1071
01:03:30,445 --> 01:03:33,025
apparently eh, tying up securing
some insurance payments

1072
01:03:33,065 --> 01:03:35,905
so, a housing armageddon
is not prudent investing.

1073
01:03:35,985 --> 01:03:37,125
What did Kathy say?

1074
01:03:37,385 --> 01:03:39,925
Nothing yet, she keeps asking
if this is one of your crusades

1075
01:03:40,324 --> 01:03:44,123
ok, I want you to walk back in there
and very calmly, very politely

1076
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:46,144
tell the risk-assessors to fuck off!

1077
01:03:46,605 --> 01:03:49,625
And then meet me over at standard & poors,
we're gonna talk to Georgia

1078
01:03:50,905 --> 01:03:54,744
get that fuck Jared vennett
I want to bash his fucking head in

1079
01:03:59,784 --> 01:04:00,804
uh, gentlemen...

1080
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:03,005
I spoke with mark baum

1081
01:04:03,284 --> 01:04:04,844
he says: To fuck off!

1082
01:04:18,804 --> 01:04:20,304
I don't see a damn thing.

1083
01:04:22,065 --> 01:04:24,364
Aaah, my eye-doctor is always busy

1084
01:04:24,405 --> 01:04:28,864
I end up taking any appointment
and my whole morning gets shot to hell!

1085
01:04:30,565 --> 01:04:31,565
So...

1086
01:04:32,105 --> 01:04:33,125
Alrighty

1087
01:04:34,164 --> 01:04:36,184
front-point partners

1088
01:04:37,184 --> 01:04:38,704
how can standard & poors help you?

1089
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:41,981
Well, we don't understand
why the ratings-agencies

1090
01:04:41,992 --> 01:04:43,644
haven't downgraded
sub-prime bonds

1091
01:04:43,704 --> 01:04:46,065
since the underlying loans
are clearly deteriorating

1092
01:04:46,664 --> 01:04:48,666
well, the delinquency-rates
do have people

1093
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:50,925
worried, but they're
actually within our models

1094
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:52,224
so.

1095
01:04:52,304 --> 01:04:53,304
Says you?

1096
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:58,005
You're convinced the underlying mortgages
in these bonds are solid loans?

1097
01:04:59,224 --> 01:05:01,164
That is our opinion yeah.
Oh crack the tape!

1098
01:05:01,465 --> 01:05:03,244
Have you looked at the loan-level data?

1099
01:05:03,585 --> 01:05:05,150
What you think we do here all day?
They're giving

1100
01:05:05,161 --> 01:05:06,864
these loans to anyone with
a credit-score and a pulse

1101
01:05:06,985 --> 01:05:09,264
what do you think we do here all day?

1102
01:05:09,264 --> 01:05:10,463
Not sure, I guess that's why we're here.

1103
01:05:10,465 --> 01:05:11,385
What I don't understand

1104
01:05:11,385 --> 01:05:12,644
we can't re-recheck and then check again!

1105
01:05:12,744 --> 01:05:16,605
If these mortgage-bonds
are so stable, so solid

1106
01:05:16,885 --> 01:05:19,384
have you ever refused to rate?

1107
01:05:19,385 --> 01:05:21,445
You're delusional! We
stand behind it Georgia!

1108
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:25,364
Have you ever refused to rate
any of these bonds upper-tranches AAA?

1109
01:05:26,324 --> 01:05:27,603
Can we see the paperwork on those?

1110
01:05:27,605 --> 01:05:32,023
Oooh, I'm under no obligation to share that
information with you, whoever you might be.

1111
01:05:32,025 --> 01:05:35,304
Just answer the question Georgia,
can you name one time in the past year?

1112
01:05:35,304 --> 01:05:37,880
Where you checked the
tape and you didn't give

1113
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:40,204
the banks the
AAA-percentage they wanted?

1114
01:05:42,965 --> 01:05:46,244
If we don;T give them the ratings,
they'll go to moody's right down the block.

1115
01:05:46,965 --> 01:05:50,824
If we don't work with them
they will go to our competitors

1116
01:05:51,164 --> 01:05:53,565
not our fault,
simply the way the world works.

1117
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:00,425
Holy shit!
Ah yes, now you see it!

1118
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,125
And I never said that!

1119
01:06:04,425 --> 01:06:05,704
You're selling ratings for fee's

1120
01:06:06,664 --> 01:06:07,664
a ratings shop

1121
01:06:07,844 --> 01:06:09,885
you could afford to make less,
make less.

1122
01:06:10,664 --> 01:06:11,824
Nobody said that!

1123
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:14,844
And it is not my decision,
I have a boss.

1124
01:06:15,105 --> 01:06:18,204
Are you kidding me?
No I am not kidding you!

1125
01:06:20,025 --> 01:06:21,503
Is that the angle you're taking?

1126
01:06:21,505 --> 01:06:23,364
So now anybody who has a boss,

1127
01:06:23,644 --> 01:06:27,664
can't be held responsible for doing shitty
and illegal things! -What are you? Four?

1128
01:06:28,105 --> 01:06:29,804
No, eh, eh, I am not four!

1129
01:06:30,545 --> 01:06:32,344
Mister baum, I am not, no!

1130
01:06:32,784 --> 01:06:35,844
And I wonder, I wonder,
what your incentives might be.

1131
01:06:36,164 --> 01:06:40,105
Is it maybe in your best interest to have
the ratings changed? Is it, perhaps?

1132
01:06:42,644 --> 01:06:45,125
How many credit default swaps do you own?

1133
01:06:47,264 --> 01:06:48,664
Doesn't make me wrong

1134
01:06:50,565 --> 01:06:51,784
just makes you a hypocrite!

1135
01:07:33,005 --> 01:07:35,204
Raaaaaahr!

1136
01:07:35,204 --> 01:07:38,364
Mortgage-delinquencies went up and the
cdo's got more valuable, unbelievable!

1137
01:07:38,364 --> 01:07:40,784
We know, it's completely backwards!

1138
01:07:41,025 --> 01:07:44,143
I just called an old friend at bear
he didn't even know what a cdo is.

1139
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:48,684
Yeah, I just had to wire bear and deutsche
seventy thousand dollars

1140
01:07:48,684 --> 01:07:50,985
it's like two plus two equals...

1141
01:07:51,784 --> 01:07:52,344
Fish!

1142
01:07:52,684 --> 01:07:53,684
Great!

1143
01:07:53,905 --> 01:07:55,164
You bought into a rigged game

1144
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:59,184
we lose everything.. -I'm gonna
have to move back in with my mom!

1145
01:08:00,485 --> 01:08:01,485
Can't do that

1146
01:08:01,784 --> 01:08:03,625
well, alright I got a
colon in a couple of mins

1147
01:08:04,144 --> 01:08:05,264
wait a minute, hold on! Ben!

1148
01:08:05,844 --> 01:08:06,844
Ben, look!

1149
01:08:07,244 --> 01:08:12,324
Either the banks are clueless and they
don't know how to value these cdo's or...

1150
01:08:13,304 --> 01:08:18,305
They're suck crooks that... the cdo's
are worth shit, and they're hiding it!

1151
01:08:21,324 --> 01:08:22,645
I think we should buy more swaps!

1152
01:08:23,664 --> 01:08:26,465
What? -Suck it up and pay
up fellas we made a deal

1153
01:08:26,585 --> 01:08:28,564
no way, no!

1154
01:08:28,564 --> 01:08:30,595
Are you fucking kidding me?
You come in here you fucking

1155
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,606
fucking! -You're a fuck,
how do you even seriously?

1156
01:08:32,784 --> 01:08:35,104
No, no, no! Yeah!

1157
01:08:35,185 --> 01:08:41,444
You're unbelievable!
<Lndistinct shouting and cussing>

1158
01:08:41,645 --> 01:08:43,585
no, no, no!

1159
01:08:43,885 --> 01:08:45,283
Seriously, colonic once a year!

1160
01:08:45,284 --> 01:08:48,744
Ass! -You got a matching little
Butler-boy you butt-fuck!

1161
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:54,045
Are you done?

1162
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:57,225
Think so yeah -God I pulled a
muscle in my bowl from yelling

1163
01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:02,824
mortgage defaults have done nothing
but go up!

1164
01:09:03,984 --> 01:09:06,425
Yet you quote us
a higher price on the bonds

1165
01:09:08,045 --> 01:09:09,965
please explain that to me!
There's no way that makes sense!

1166
01:09:10,085 --> 01:09:12,365
There's no way you're
marketing these swaps appropriately!

1167
01:09:13,845 --> 01:09:16,126
I mean, why shouldn't we back out
of this trade right now?

1168
01:09:18,265 --> 01:09:21,725
Didn't I say, that when we made this deal,
that the rating-agencies, the scc

1169
01:09:21,845 --> 01:09:24,005
and the big banks were clueless!
Didn't I say that?

1170
01:09:24,864 --> 01:09:26,904
Didn't I say it?
Yes you did, you did!

1171
01:09:27,725 --> 01:09:28,725
Shut up!

1172
01:09:29,284 --> 01:09:32,404
Now their foot's on fire and they think
their steak is done, and you're surprised?

1173
01:09:32,404 --> 01:09:34,685
That's not stupidity...
That's fraud!

1174
01:09:35,284 --> 01:09:37,077
Tell me the difference
between stupid and illegal

1175
01:09:37,088 --> 01:09:38,689
and I'll have my wife's
brother arrested.

1176
01:09:41,125 --> 01:09:44,385
That was funny! -I guess you just don't
realize how clueless the system really is!

1177
01:09:45,645 --> 01:09:48,024
Yes, there's some shady shit going down!

1178
01:09:48,024 --> 01:09:51,185
But trust me, it's fueled by stupidity!

1179
01:09:52,805 --> 01:09:53,805
Look at yourselves!

1180
01:09:54,725 --> 01:09:57,185
You know you passed yourselves off
as cynical people but...

1181
01:09:58,324 --> 01:10:00,284
You still have some faith
in the system don't you?

1182
01:10:00,824 --> 01:10:01,824
I don't

1183
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:03,125
well, except for Vinnie!

1184
01:10:04,104 --> 01:10:04,704
Who gives a shit?

1185
01:10:04,984 --> 01:10:06,484
No way! Look!

1186
01:10:06,984 --> 01:10:09,885
Either we're right, or we're wrong
in a giant, giant way!

1187
01:10:10,324 --> 01:10:13,404
And if we're wrong then we gotta find
someone to help us get out of this trade

1188
01:10:13,984 --> 01:10:16,503
I'm not feeling remotely
confident that we're right

1189
01:10:16,505 --> 01:10:18,564
and, and... if we're wrong

1190
01:10:19,064 --> 01:10:23,104
who's gonna tell us? Who understands
this stuff? It makes no sense!

1191
01:10:26,064 --> 01:10:27,484
I think we need to go to Vegas!

1192
01:10:27,864 --> 01:10:29,564
What's in Vegas? Vegas!

1193
01:10:30,204 --> 01:10:31,685
What the hell is in Las Vegas?

1194
01:10:33,204 --> 01:10:35,864
The American securitization forum
is there next week

1195
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:40,604
every bond and cdo-salesman, sub-prime
lender and swap-trader is gonna be there

1196
01:10:41,225 --> 01:10:42,225
I'm telling you

1197
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:43,984
your bet is against their money,

1198
01:10:43,984 --> 01:10:46,904
it's about time you find out
just how dumb that money really is

1199
01:10:46,904 --> 01:10:47,925
God no, I hate Vegas!

1200
01:10:48,145 --> 01:10:50,984
I hear the food has gotten really
good in Vegas, they have a nobu now

1201
01:10:51,864 --> 01:10:52,864
could you fucking stop!

1202
01:11:39,024 --> 01:11:41,944
In a sense?
If the bond is rich, it is.

1203
01:11:42,284 --> 01:11:44,564
Rich just means overpriced

1204
01:11:45,284 --> 01:11:47,864
I can't sleep on a plane so I did
my homework -ok, let's focus!

1205
01:11:48,585 --> 01:11:49,585
What's our goal?

1206
01:11:50,204 --> 01:11:52,684
Figure out if this is a
deal of a lifetime or...

1207
01:11:52,685 --> 01:11:55,845
Everyone knows here something we don't
and we're gonna get royally screwed

1208
01:11:56,204 --> 01:11:58,505
right, remember that
when you meet with guys from bear!

1209
01:11:59,125 --> 01:12:00,664
I'll set you up with a face-to-face

1210
01:12:00,925 --> 01:12:02,064
awesome, where is that?

1211
01:12:02,364 --> 01:12:06,465
Holy shit! Five years ago securitization
was a loser-convention

1212
01:12:06,885 --> 01:12:08,744
a hundred, maybe two-hundred
people would show

1213
01:12:09,085 --> 01:12:11,024
500 billion dollars later you get this!

1214
01:12:11,104 --> 01:12:12,783
There's a lot of smuck-looking
people in here huh!?

1215
01:12:12,784 --> 01:12:14,484
It looks like someone
just hit a piñata that

1216
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,256
was filled with white
people who suck at golf

1217
01:12:16,685 --> 01:12:19,284
I mean, who are all these clown?
Ah come on, I think it looks fun!

1218
01:12:19,444 --> 01:12:22,284
Charlie, vennett says these are
the people we're betting against.

1219
01:12:23,024 --> 01:12:26,864
Yeah, here we go
Chris on my left, Chris, on my left!

1220
01:12:27,645 --> 01:12:31,664
Gentlemen! -When do we get a chance to
face-time with some of these lovely folks?

1221
01:12:32,045 --> 01:12:33,225
Chris, give em the key-cords!

1222
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:35,604
Do you even know which
key-cords you're giving out?

1223
01:12:36,005 --> 01:12:38,664
First of all, how was your travel?
Uneventful?

1224
01:12:38,845 --> 01:12:41,104
Uneventful!
Ok, I've been here for six hours!

1225
01:12:41,265 --> 01:12:43,242
I've already been to the
gym, I had two poached eggs,

1226
01:12:43,253 --> 01:12:45,054
and I played Blackjack
with Harry Dean Stanton

1227
01:12:45,104 --> 01:12:46,404
thank you for your diary!

1228
01:12:46,944 --> 01:12:48,252
Face-time! I'd like some face-time!
Just

1229
01:12:48,265 --> 01:12:49,805
remember, we're here just
to gather information!

1230
01:12:50,145 --> 01:12:53,404
We're gathering information,
we're not advertising our short-position!

1231
01:12:53,784 --> 01:12:55,963
Right? We don't want to spook anybody!
Can we do that?

1232
01:12:55,965 --> 01:12:57,484
You got a big mouth,
and you like to run it

1233
01:12:57,484 --> 01:13:00,204
can you just keep it shut
for a few minutes? -Ok, ok!

1234
01:13:00,385 --> 01:13:01,925
Yeah, don't worry, we'll play nice!

1235
01:13:02,185 --> 01:13:03,185
Ladies and gentlemen!

1236
01:13:03,925 --> 01:13:05,604
Business is good!

1237
01:13:06,204 --> 01:13:07,583
Profits are strong!

1238
01:13:07,585 --> 01:13:12,784
And the mortgage continues to be
the bedrock on which this economy is built.

1239
01:13:17,744 --> 01:13:21,444
Yes, we had to take some losses
in our sub-prime department last year,

1240
01:13:21,484 --> 01:13:24,944
but those losses,
will be contained at only five percent!

1241
01:13:25,404 --> 01:13:25,864
Now

1242
01:13:26,385 --> 01:13:27,765
in our residential sector...

1243
01:13:27,965 --> 01:13:28,965
Mark, it's not a q&a!

1244
01:13:29,024 --> 01:13:32,164
Of those variable rate-packages
were gobbled up by the

1245
01:13:32,524 --> 01:13:33,925
I have a question please!

1246
01:13:37,585 --> 01:13:41,684
Sir, the q&a is after my statement,
but you know what, you seem anxious!

1247
01:13:41,685 --> 01:13:43,984
How can I help you? How are you?
Fine, thank you!

1248
01:13:44,204 --> 01:13:45,404
Would you say,

1249
01:13:45,404 --> 01:13:48,884
that is it a possibility,
or a probability

1250
01:13:48,885 --> 01:13:51,925
that sub-prime losses stop at five percent?

1251
01:13:52,545 --> 01:13:53,484
Thank you!

1252
01:13:53,485 --> 01:13:57,965
I would say it is a very
strong probability, indeed!

1253
01:13:58,805 --> 01:14:01,503
So, ehm, back to the residential sector,

1254
01:14:01,505 --> 01:14:04,145
when we rolled out the new
variable rates package -excuse me!

1255
01:14:04,164 --> 01:14:05,984
The ehm. He he he!

1256
01:14:07,645 --> 01:14:08,645
Zero!

1257
01:14:08,824 --> 01:14:09,824
Zero!

1258
01:14:10,704 --> 01:14:11,864
Zero!

1259
01:14:12,145 --> 01:14:14,805
There is a zero percent chance

1260
01:14:15,045 --> 01:14:18,685
that your sub-prime losses
will stop at five percent!

1261
01:14:19,064 --> 01:14:20,064
Zero!

1262
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:21,125
Excuse me!

1263
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:24,564
I have to take this
he must be from bank of America!

1264
01:14:26,805 --> 01:14:29,005
No, I'm really not doing
anything right now!

1265
01:14:29,324 --> 01:14:32,045
As I was saying, our residential sector
uh huh, and how are the kids?

1266
01:14:32,164 --> 01:14:34,545
Consumers reacted to our packages

1267
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:37,783
mark baum really did that!
When we were in Vegas he did that!

1268
01:14:37,784 --> 01:14:39,524
He said that... he took the call,

1269
01:14:40,444 --> 01:14:41,885
now you see what I had to deal with!

1270
01:14:53,085 --> 01:14:54,324
Woohoo!

1271
01:14:58,265 --> 01:15:00,265
This uzi is fucking awesome!

1272
01:15:00,385 --> 01:15:02,904
If I can get this cdo-machine to run
for another two years

1273
01:15:02,904 --> 01:15:05,585
and then, I'm rich as fuck
and I got my house in Aspen!

1274
01:15:06,484 --> 01:15:08,559
But do you have any
concerns about the

1275
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:11,085
performance of the
underlying securitizations?

1276
01:15:11,145 --> 01:15:13,043
It's easy to see that delinquencies,

1277
01:15:13,045 --> 01:15:15,704
eh, default-rates are
on the rise right now!

1278
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:18,185
Could you please stop being
such a buzz-kill dude!

1279
01:15:18,744 --> 01:15:20,845
We didn't bring you out here
to talk about work bro!

1280
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:22,545
Why'd you bring us out here?

1281
01:15:22,805 --> 01:15:25,604
Because we need to be able
to expense the ammo to a client!

1282
01:15:26,164 --> 01:15:28,324
We're gonna shoot some terrorists,
watch out boys!

1283
01:15:29,425 --> 01:15:32,244
These guys are morons!
Fucking tool!

1284
01:15:34,685 --> 01:15:35,863
Woo!- Fuck yes!

1285
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,764
Boom, yeah man boom!

1286
01:15:37,765 --> 01:15:41,585
We ought to be buying every swap we can get
our hands on! Just hold on okay, hold on!

1287
01:15:42,164 --> 01:15:46,444
My brothers ex-girlfriend works for the
scc, she just told me she's in town, okay!?

1288
01:15:46,444 --> 01:15:50,265
So if we're missing something, maybe
she can tell me, give me some insight.

1289
01:15:50,364 --> 01:15:54,404
In the mean-time, you go to the main floor
to buy some more swaps

1290
01:15:54,404 --> 01:15:57,944
well actually, we're about
to invest in housing bonds.

1291
01:15:58,664 --> 01:16:01,363
I was just wondering if
the scc is worried about them at all

1292
01:16:01,364 --> 01:16:04,104
I know you're not allowed to tell
me specifics, but, just generally.

1293
01:16:04,104 --> 01:16:06,204
Ow, we don't investigate mortgage bonds

1294
01:16:06,425 --> 01:16:09,645
truth is, since we had our budgets cut,
we don't investigate much!

1295
01:16:12,005 --> 01:16:14,364
Then why are you here? I thought..
I'm not here for the scc!

1296
01:16:14,864 --> 01:16:16,244
I'm here on my own dime

1297
01:16:17,524 --> 01:16:20,225
I'm floating my resume to some big banks!

1298
01:16:20,744 --> 01:16:22,145
How's your brother by the way?

1299
01:16:22,505 --> 01:16:24,463
How are you floating your
resume to big banks?

1300
01:16:24,465 --> 01:16:27,423
I mean, you're supposed to be
the ones policing the big banks

1301
01:16:27,425 --> 01:16:28,505
grow up Jamie!

1302
01:16:28,744 --> 01:16:32,564
There must be some kind of law
against working for a financial institution

1303
01:16:32,564 --> 01:16:35,744
right after you've been working
in financial regulation right?

1304
01:16:36,045 --> 01:16:37,045
No!

1305
01:16:37,564 --> 01:16:38,564
No!

1306
01:16:39,524 --> 01:16:40,524
Hey!

1307
01:16:41,045 --> 01:16:42,045
Dougie!

1308
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:46,664
Hey, come over here! What are you
doing at Caesar's? He's a Goldman

1309
01:16:48,824 --> 01:16:53,664
we can do bbb-level swaps
at 500 basis points, maybe!

1310
01:16:53,845 --> 01:16:57,585
You're praising the swaps,
like the bond is gonna collapse

1311
01:16:57,944 --> 01:17:00,225
even though the bond-value
is going up? Really?

1312
01:17:00,744 --> 01:17:03,625
Exciting times!
What the hell is going on?!

1313
01:18:01,824 --> 01:18:05,784
Lewis, can you come early tomorrow, please?

1314
01:18:05,845 --> 01:18:09,784
I need to unload the aig and
country-wide Freddy Mac positions

1315
01:18:09,845 --> 01:18:12,125
so we can afford the premiums on the

1316
01:18:13,524 --> 01:18:15,904
core mortgage-shorts on the swaps

1317
01:18:16,824 --> 01:18:17,885
no problem Dr. burry.

1318
01:18:20,204 --> 01:18:21,385
Dr. burry!

1319
01:18:25,164 --> 01:18:27,204
If the investors withdraw,
what's gonna happen here?

1320
01:18:27,984 --> 01:18:28,984
Are we done?

1321
01:18:29,085 --> 01:18:30,465
Honestly I don't know!

1322
01:18:35,324 --> 01:18:36,704
The, the...

1323
01:18:38,744 --> 01:18:40,244
The bonds aren't going down!

1324
01:18:42,045 --> 01:18:43,045
They won't move!

1325
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:44,385
It's possible

1326
01:18:45,225 --> 01:18:49,425
that we are in a completely
fraudulent system.

1327
01:18:51,225 --> 01:18:54,045
Or... you're, you're wrong.

1328
01:18:58,564 --> 01:18:59,864
Sure!

1329
01:19:00,364 --> 01:19:03,585
It's possible,
I just don't know how!

1330
01:19:09,524 --> 01:19:10,524
I guess...

1331
01:19:10,564 --> 01:19:11,564
When...

1332
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:13,024
Someone's wrong, they never..

1333
01:19:13,744 --> 01:19:15,564
They never... Know how!

1334
01:19:20,364 --> 01:19:22,564
See you in the morning! Yeah.

1335
01:19:24,364 --> 01:19:26,145
Even bear up their prices!

1336
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:29,125
They keep calling us brownhall

1337
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,604
you just don't have the money or the
reputation, don't take it personal!

1338
01:19:32,645 --> 01:19:34,162
I don't think I have
the strip-club in me

1339
01:19:34,173 --> 01:19:35,974
tonight I'm just gonna
get some drinks around.

1340
01:19:36,904 --> 01:19:40,845
Watch some pay-per-view
book us some flights out for the morning.

1341
01:19:41,585 --> 01:19:43,984
D- d-deal, we need a deal, right, a deal.

1342
01:19:44,465 --> 01:19:48,685
Uhm, we need a deal we can afford,
we need a deal they're not gonna refuse!

1343
01:19:49,005 --> 01:19:51,505
So... what can we do? We can...

1344
01:19:53,345 --> 01:19:56,024
The aa-tranches,
what if we bet against the aa-tranches?

1345
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:58,024
Who's not gonna take that bet?

1346
01:19:58,164 --> 01:20:01,243
We know that they say
they're ninety-five percent AAA-rated

1347
01:20:01,244 --> 01:20:03,061
but in reality, they're
more like twenty-five

1348
01:20:03,073 --> 01:20:04,664
percent, some of them
are zero percent!

1349
01:20:05,944 --> 01:20:08,663
We also know that if the bottom-tranches
fail at over eight percent

1350
01:20:08,664 --> 01:20:10,845
the upper-tranches are affected
and they go to zero.

1351
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:14,404
I'll bet you right now,
that those aa's are actually like b's!

1352
01:20:14,744 --> 01:20:17,923
I rarely ever say these words
but I think Charlie is right!

1353
01:20:17,925 --> 01:20:19,385
Look, Ben!

1354
01:20:21,425 --> 01:20:22,425
Pay-off!

1355
01:20:23,545 --> 01:20:26,784
Is 200-to-1, but they're all
taking the ratings off face value

1356
01:20:27,225 --> 01:20:30,484
they're charging penny's on the dollar
to bet against double-a's

1357
01:20:31,904 --> 01:20:33,904
just when I start thinking
you guys are clowns!

1358
01:20:34,845 --> 01:20:36,984
No-one on the planet is
betting against double-a's

1359
01:20:37,505 --> 01:20:40,164
the banks will think we're either high,
or having a stroke

1360
01:20:40,484 --> 01:20:42,284
and they'll take every
dime we have to offer!

1361
01:20:45,404 --> 01:20:46,404
Kind of brilliant!

1362
01:20:48,585 --> 01:20:50,505
This is what we did,
that no-one else thought of.

1363
01:20:50,765 --> 01:20:53,085
Not even baum or Berry thought
to short the double-a's

1364
01:20:53,744 --> 01:20:54,744
but we did.

1365
01:20:55,064 --> 01:20:56,585
Little brownhall capitol

1366
01:20:57,164 --> 01:21:00,864
so we're interesting in shorting
some of the aa-tranches of cdo's

1367
01:21:02,104 --> 01:21:03,585
come on guys, what's the angle?

1368
01:21:03,885 --> 01:21:06,184
I've got no angle, we're new to this,
we're just so hyped!

1369
01:21:06,185 --> 01:21:09,604
We wanna do fifteen million
in swaps on the double-a tranche

1370
01:21:10,685 --> 01:21:11,704
I don't understand!

1371
01:21:11,744 --> 01:21:13,704
You can buy as much
double-a tranches as you want!

1372
01:21:16,324 --> 01:21:18,085
Forty million against the double-a

1373
01:21:18,704 --> 01:21:21,243
brother, I would sell you
as much as you want!

1374
01:21:21,244 --> 01:21:23,505
I understand perfectly Bob!
Want the deal?

1375
01:21:25,744 --> 01:21:27,925
That's cool, that's alright with me!

1376
01:21:35,585 --> 01:21:36,944
He's gone!

1377
01:21:39,005 --> 01:21:41,444
Don't do that! Stop, stop!

1378
01:21:41,965 --> 01:21:43,645
Stop that! Charlie! Wooooh!

1379
01:21:43,685 --> 01:21:45,784
Stop it, stop!

1380
01:21:47,625 --> 01:21:48,625
What?

1381
01:21:50,204 --> 01:21:51,765
Do you have any idea what you just did?

1382
01:21:51,944 --> 01:21:55,064
Come on, we just made the deal of
our lifetime, we should celebrate!

1383
01:21:55,064 --> 01:21:57,024
You just bet against the American economy!

1384
01:21:57,024 --> 01:21:58,404
Fuck yeah we did! Yeah!

1385
01:21:58,404 --> 01:22:00,583
Which means! Fuck yeah! Oh!

1386
01:22:00,585 --> 01:22:02,604
Which means... If we're right...

1387
01:22:04,465 --> 01:22:06,064
If we're right, people lose homes!

1388
01:22:06,305 --> 01:22:07,404
People lose jobs!

1389
01:22:07,845 --> 01:22:10,164
People lose retirement savings,
people lose pensions!

1390
01:22:11,064 --> 01:22:13,484
You know what I hate about fucking banking!
It reduces people to numbers!

1391
01:22:13,484 --> 01:22:15,444
Here's a number!
Every one percent unemployment goes up,

1392
01:22:15,444 --> 01:22:17,444
40 thousand people die!
Did you know that?!

1393
01:22:17,444 --> 01:22:19,704
Did you know that?
No, I didn't know that!

1394
01:22:21,505 --> 01:22:22,904
We were just excited!

1395
01:22:25,345 --> 01:22:26,904
Just don't fucking dance!

1396
01:22:28,284 --> 01:22:29,625
Alright! Where are you going?

1397
01:22:34,404 --> 01:22:36,225
Whoah, I just got really scared!

1398
01:22:38,164 --> 01:22:39,545
First of all, great show today!

1399
01:22:40,145 --> 01:22:40,904
You were terrific!

1400
01:22:41,085 --> 01:22:43,284
Thank you!
Your big mouth was a revelation!

1401
01:22:43,465 --> 01:22:44,645
I appreciate that!

1402
01:22:45,225 --> 01:22:46,884
You worried you,
and your swaps were getting played?

1403
01:22:46,885 --> 01:22:49,725
Well, this is an opportunity for you
to meet who you're betting against!

1404
01:22:50,385 --> 01:22:52,144
Try not to get too righteous
and listen a little!

1405
01:22:52,145 --> 01:22:53,703
Ok, fine! Who is this guy?

1406
01:22:53,704 --> 01:22:55,444
A real solid-gold asshole!

1407
01:22:55,645 --> 01:22:56,645
I'm a cdo-manager

1408
01:22:56,984 --> 01:22:59,064
a cdo-manager?
Yup, at Harding advisors

1409
01:22:59,965 --> 01:23:03,164
I didn't realize that there
was anything to manage with cdo's

1410
01:23:03,805 --> 01:23:04,984
oh, well.

1411
01:23:05,784 --> 01:23:09,663
We select the securities that go into
the cdo-portfolio and monitor the assets

1412
01:23:09,664 --> 01:23:11,524
I do most of meryll-lynch's cdo's

1413
01:23:11,524 --> 01:23:14,024
do you represent the
investors or meryll-lynch?

1414
01:23:14,725 --> 01:23:15,345
The investors!

1415
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:16,704
You do.

1416
01:23:17,024 --> 01:23:18,204
Yeah! But...

1417
01:23:18,604 --> 01:23:21,125
Meryll-lynch isn't gonna send you
any costumers unless you put

1418
01:23:21,324 --> 01:23:23,564
merrill-lynch's bonds in your cdo...

1419
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:25,984
Good question!

1420
01:23:25,985 --> 01:23:27,845
Let's just assume merrill and I have a...

1421
01:23:28,585 --> 01:23:29,864
We have a good relationship

1422
01:23:30,604 --> 01:23:32,484
you have a good relationship
with merrill-lynch?

1423
01:23:32,944 --> 01:23:34,104
We've been doing business together

1424
01:23:34,104 --> 01:23:35,604
and so the cdo's..

1425
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,064
That you create

1426
01:23:37,265 --> 01:23:39,585
are, are, are, of the highest quality

1427
01:23:40,164 --> 01:23:41,024
and the highest of value!

1428
01:23:41,025 --> 01:23:42,604
Absolutely! Absolutely!

1429
01:23:43,324 --> 01:23:46,425
Are you at all concerned
about the rising default-rates?

1430
01:23:48,845 --> 01:23:54,085
I assume no risk for
this produce myself mark

1431
01:23:54,564 --> 01:23:55,564
okay!

1432
01:23:57,524 --> 01:23:58,704
So let me get this straight

1433
01:23:58,885 --> 01:24:00,005
the bank calls you up

1434
01:24:01,225 --> 01:24:02,764
they give you the bonds they wanna sell

1435
01:24:02,765 --> 01:24:05,925
they give you clients,
they give you money to run your business,

1436
01:24:06,704 --> 01:24:08,364
give you fat fee's for doing so

1437
01:24:08,545 --> 01:24:10,885
but you represent the investors?

1438
01:24:11,965 --> 01:24:12,885
Is that right?

1439
01:24:12,944 --> 01:24:13,944
Yeah!

1440
01:24:14,284 --> 01:24:15,824
But we're not in the
merrill-lynch building!

1441
01:24:15,965 --> 01:24:17,484
Ok, where are you?
We're in New Jersey!

1442
01:24:17,904 --> 01:24:18,984
You're twenty minutes away!

1443
01:24:19,564 --> 01:24:21,845
Five, if you use the helicopter!

1444
01:24:23,324 --> 01:24:24,404
That's funny eh?

1445
01:24:24,744 --> 01:24:26,005
That's hilarious!

1446
01:24:29,024 --> 01:24:30,024
Oh boy!

1447
01:24:30,604 --> 01:24:32,225
Your boss is about to explode!

1448
01:24:32,925 --> 01:24:34,685
No, he's too curious to explode!

1449
01:24:34,744 --> 01:24:36,064
Hold on, say that again!

1450
01:24:36,064 --> 01:24:38,185
Cdo a, has parts of cdo b

1451
01:24:38,465 --> 01:24:42,604
and cdo b, has parts of cdo a
and then they both get put inside cdo c.

1452
01:24:42,765 --> 01:24:44,345
Yeah and that one is called cdo square!

1453
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:46,685
A cdo of a cdo!

1454
01:24:47,225 --> 01:24:47,664
Right?

1455
01:24:48,225 --> 01:24:50,136
And then there's cdo's
made up of the opposite

1456
01:24:50,148 --> 01:24:51,784
sides of the bet you
made with the swaps

1457
01:24:52,104 --> 01:24:54,283
we call them, synthetic cdo's

1458
01:24:54,284 --> 01:24:58,204
what did you just say? Synthetic cdo's?
That is fucking crazy!

1459
01:24:58,404 --> 01:24:59,404
It's not! It's awesome!

1460
01:25:01,704 --> 01:25:05,444
His face is starting to boil
he looks like the bad guy from doom

1461
01:25:09,185 --> 01:25:10,564
alright, let's say...

1462
01:25:11,545 --> 01:25:15,064
You have a pool of 50
million in sub-prime loans

1463
01:25:15,244 --> 01:25:17,484
how much money could be
out there betting on it

1464
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:22,125
in your synthetic cdo's and swaps?
Right now! Tonight!

1465
01:25:22,744 --> 01:25:23,744
50 million.. Hmm..

1466
01:25:26,045 --> 01:25:27,185
A billion dollars

1467
01:25:27,364 --> 01:25:28,364
what?

1468
01:25:29,305 --> 01:25:32,484
If the mortgage-bonds that
Michael burry discovered were the match...

1469
01:25:33,944 --> 01:25:37,925
How much bigger is the market for insuring
mortgage bonds than for actual mortgages?

1470
01:25:39,204 --> 01:25:40,284
About twenty times!

1471
01:25:40,465 --> 01:25:42,404
If the mortgage bonds were the match...

1472
01:25:42,744 --> 01:25:45,204
Then the cdo's were the
kerosene soaked rags.

1473
01:25:45,324 --> 01:25:47,923
Then the synthetic cdo was the atomic bomb

1474
01:25:47,925 --> 01:25:50,444
with a drunk president holding
his finger over the button

1475
01:25:50,685 --> 01:25:53,043
it was at that moment
in that dumb restaurant

1476
01:25:53,045 --> 01:25:56,085
with that stupid look on his face
that mark baum realized

1477
01:25:56,225 --> 01:25:58,784
the whole world economy might collapse!

1478
01:26:02,244 --> 01:26:03,524
And I know what you're thinking!

1479
01:26:04,404 --> 01:26:06,484
What the fuck is a synthetic cdo?

1480
01:26:09,024 --> 01:26:11,997
Well, here's Dr. thaler,
father of behavioral

1481
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:14,604
economics, and Selena
Gomez to explain!

1482
01:26:15,664 --> 01:26:18,425
Ok, so here's how a synthetic cdo works!

1483
01:26:19,125 --> 01:26:21,465
Let's say I bet ten million
o a black Jack hand.

1484
01:26:21,965 --> 01:26:26,725
Ten million, because this hand is
to represent a single mortgage bond

1485
01:26:29,944 --> 01:26:32,163
okay, Selena has a pretty good hand here!

1486
01:26:32,164 --> 01:26:36,164
Showing eighteen, dealer showing seven
that's a really good hand for Selena!

1487
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:39,104
Good odds,
in fact her chances of winning this hand

1488
01:26:39,284 --> 01:26:40,604
are eighty-seven percent

1489
01:26:40,725 --> 01:26:42,324
so, my odds are good

1490
01:26:42,704 --> 01:26:43,925
I'm on a winning streak

1491
01:26:44,244 --> 01:26:46,824
everybody in this place
wants to get in on the action

1492
01:26:47,104 --> 01:26:48,164
how could I lose right?

1493
01:26:48,385 --> 01:26:50,123
Now this is a classic error

1494
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:52,805
in basketball it's called
the hot-hand-fallacy

1495
01:26:53,244 --> 01:26:55,364
a player makes a bunch of shots in a row

1496
01:26:55,664 --> 01:26:57,704
people are sure they're
gonna make the next one

1497
01:26:57,885 --> 01:26:59,984
people think, whatever is happening now

1498
01:26:59,984 --> 01:27:02,625
is gonna continue to
happen into the future!

1499
01:27:02,765 --> 01:27:04,465
During the real-estate boom

1500
01:27:04,505 --> 01:27:06,323
markets were going up and up!

1501
01:27:06,324 --> 01:27:08,045
And people thought they
would never go down!

1502
01:27:08,145 --> 01:27:11,904
People who are watching and think
that I won't lose will make a side-bet

1503
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:14,364
now this, is the first synthetic cdo

1504
01:27:14,425 --> 01:27:15,425
I love Selena Gomez!

1505
01:27:16,284 --> 01:27:17,743
I'll bet you fifteen million, she wins!

1506
01:27:17,744 --> 01:27:19,444
And I'll give you 3-to-1 odds!

1507
01:27:19,864 --> 01:27:20,864
3-to-1 odds?

1508
01:27:21,545 --> 01:27:23,185
Okay, I'll take that bet!

1509
01:27:23,885 --> 01:27:24,885
Now!

1510
01:27:24,944 --> 01:27:29,045
Somebody else is gonna wanna make
a bet on the outcome of their bet!

1511
01:27:29,055 --> 01:27:29,765
15 million she wins!

1512
01:27:29,765 --> 01:27:32,564
That will lead to synthetic cdo number two!

1513
01:27:32,784 --> 01:27:33,185
Hey!

1514
01:27:33,664 --> 01:27:37,305
I bet you 200 million,
that lady in the glasses, wins that bet!

1515
01:27:37,864 --> 01:27:39,104
She probably will win!

1516
01:27:39,465 --> 01:27:40,805
So I want great pay-off!

1517
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:42,064
How about 20-to-1?

1518
01:27:42,385 --> 01:27:43,385
Deal!

1519
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:48,324
And this will go on and on,
with more and more synthetic cdo's

1520
01:27:48,404 --> 01:27:52,125
and we can transform
an original ten million dollar investment

1521
01:27:52,345 --> 01:27:54,064
into billions of dollars

1522
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:56,345
you're ok?

1523
01:27:57,885 --> 01:27:58,925
No!

1524
01:28:00,444 --> 01:28:02,324
I actually feel pretty sick!

1525
01:28:07,425 --> 01:28:09,664
So I'm going to leave

1526
01:28:10,984 --> 01:28:12,925
you think I'm a parasite
don't you mister baum?

1527
01:28:14,045 --> 01:28:15,864
But apparently society values me,

1528
01:28:16,505 --> 01:28:17,704
very much.

1529
01:28:18,645 --> 01:28:20,845
En fin, let's do this!

1530
01:28:22,324 --> 01:28:23,824
I'll tell you,

1531
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,685
how much I'm worth.

1532
01:28:26,284 --> 01:28:28,204
You tell me how much you're worth!

1533
01:28:29,244 --> 01:28:31,524
You are an incredibly...

1534
01:28:31,904 --> 01:28:33,685
Big piece of shit!

1535
01:28:39,845 --> 01:28:43,145
Short everything that guy has touched,
I want half a billion more in swaps

1536
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:46,184
sure about that?
The collateral calls could bankrupt you!

1537
01:28:46,185 --> 01:28:46,845
Yeah!

1538
01:28:47,085 --> 01:28:48,264
Where are you going?

1539
01:28:48,265 --> 01:28:52,465
I am going to try to find moral redemption
and to re-lactate

1540
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:58,925
hey, hey, hey!

1541
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:04,604
These are percentages of

1542
01:30:06,265 --> 01:30:08,545
honey, I do think the
economy might collapse!

1543
01:30:08,784 --> 01:30:12,045
You've been saying that
the system is broken for years mark

1544
01:30:13,564 --> 01:30:14,885
why are you so shocked?

1545
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:21,104
It's more twisted, than
I could have imagined!

1546
01:30:21,545 --> 01:30:23,564
You love to be the virtuous one

1547
01:30:23,704 --> 01:30:25,384
I'm a banker, I'm a part of it!

1548
01:30:25,385 --> 01:30:26,505
You always have mark!

1549
01:30:27,204 --> 01:30:29,863
Like you're untainted
it changed me, it changed me!

1550
01:30:29,864 --> 01:30:31,423
Into a person,

1551
01:30:31,425 --> 01:30:33,764
who is not able to reach out to someone

1552
01:30:33,765 --> 01:30:35,585
he was in pain, my brother
was in real pain!

1553
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:38,904
I lost so much!
There is no perfect way to help

1554
01:30:41,725 --> 01:30:43,524
it sounds scary!

1555
01:30:44,265 --> 01:30:45,545
So, stop!

1556
01:30:45,864 --> 01:30:47,484
Trying to fix the world!

1557
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:48,623
He told me

1558
01:30:48,625 --> 01:30:52,085
you're not a Saint,
saints don't live on park Avenue!

1559
01:30:52,145 --> 01:30:53,465
That he was having bad thoughts.

1560
01:30:53,524 --> 01:30:56,645
Just feel the feelings,
like the rest of us!

1561
01:30:56,744 --> 01:30:57,965
My first response...

1562
01:30:59,005 --> 01:31:01,344
Was, to offer him some money.

1563
01:31:01,345 --> 01:31:03,465
I offered him fucking money!

1564
01:31:09,484 --> 01:31:11,944
His face was so smashed!

1565
01:32:39,145 --> 01:32:40,145
Michael?

1566
01:32:40,585 --> 01:32:42,024
Michael? Yes, yes!

1567
01:32:42,024 --> 01:32:43,725
Is everything ok? Yes honey!

1568
01:32:44,364 --> 01:32:44,944
Sure?

1569
01:32:44,945 --> 01:32:46,145
Yeah baby!

1570
01:32:48,045 --> 01:32:49,204
All fine, hehe!

1571
01:32:58,484 --> 01:33:01,064
To all investors, as you may know,

1572
01:33:02,225 --> 01:33:05,984
our agreement allows me,
to take extraordinary measures

1573
01:33:05,984 --> 01:33:08,284
when markets aren't functioning properly

1574
01:33:09,444 --> 01:33:11,323
I currently have reason to believe

1575
01:33:11,324 --> 01:33:15,104
the mortgage-bond market is fraudulent

1576
01:33:17,664 --> 01:33:22,024
so, in order to protect investors
from this fraudulent market

1577
01:33:22,604 --> 01:33:25,444
I've decided to restrict
investor withdrawals

1578
01:33:25,645 --> 01:33:27,623
until further notice.

1579
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:31,984
Sincerely, Dr. Michael j. Burry

1580
01:34:50,465 --> 01:34:52,225
oh my God dude, we...

1581
01:34:52,425 --> 01:34:53,663
Please stop changing the channel

1582
01:34:53,664 --> 01:34:55,664
it's been driving me crazy!
Fine!

1583
01:34:55,984 --> 01:34:58,104
Just put the business-news on please.
Thank you!

1584
01:34:58,104 --> 01:34:59,663
And the s&p picked up three points

1585
01:34:59,664 --> 01:35:00,465
Jesus!

1586
01:35:00,466 --> 01:35:01,984
Mortgage meltdown continues

1587
01:35:02,364 --> 01:35:05,045
sub-prime mortgage-lender
new century financial

1588
01:35:05,064 --> 01:35:07,685
once the industry-leader by
the way, filed for bankruptcy

1589
01:35:07,845 --> 01:35:09,685
the company immediately, ahem!

1590
01:35:10,465 --> 01:35:11,743
Good time for my voice to go

1591
01:35:11,744 --> 01:35:13,744
fired 3,200 workers

1592
01:35:13,944 --> 01:35:16,444
the manufacturing-index also
put out the month of march

1593
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:17,684
it's starting...

1594
01:35:17,685 --> 01:35:19,463
A warning that the
economic growth could slow

1595
01:35:19,465 --> 01:35:22,283
the institute of sub-prime assets
also reported a rise of prices

1596
01:35:22,284 --> 01:35:23,984
I'm gonna call my mom!

1597
01:35:26,425 --> 01:35:28,984
The principle source of the
slowdown of economic growth

1598
01:35:29,305 --> 01:35:33,743
time, and time, and time again
have I bought them back from you Marcus

1599
01:35:33,744 --> 01:35:35,043
we've know each-other for seventeen years

1600
01:35:35,045 --> 01:35:36,725
she's got some lungs on her I'm impressed!

1601
01:35:38,744 --> 01:35:40,045
Can't help but enjoy it.

1602
01:35:41,225 --> 01:35:44,505
There's no fucking way, there's no fucking
way, that the big banks are that stupid!

1603
01:35:45,425 --> 01:35:46,944
Bye Kathy!

1604
01:35:51,965 --> 01:35:53,085
Well?

1605
01:35:54,185 --> 01:35:57,864
Kathy thinks it would be a good
idea if we sold our shorts

1606
01:35:57,904 --> 01:35:58,664
what else is new?

1607
01:35:58,666 --> 01:36:01,005
And she said that
Morgan-Stanley will buy them

1608
01:36:01,045 --> 01:36:02,045
holy shit!

1609
01:36:02,685 --> 01:36:03,685
What did you say?

1610
01:36:03,944 --> 01:36:05,765
I told her we're not selling shit!

1611
01:36:11,765 --> 01:36:15,125
Ah, if you need the.. Ehm,
files for 2005

1612
01:36:15,784 --> 01:36:19,244
mister field's suit is very specific
to files from the past year

1613
01:36:19,545 --> 01:36:22,765
good, then get out!
Say hi to Lawrence for me! And both do!

1614
01:36:26,645 --> 01:36:28,185
You can't call me back for a week?

1615
01:36:28,404 --> 01:36:30,045
I'm so sorry Mike!

1616
01:36:30,685 --> 01:36:33,984
Goldman had a systems failure
I lost a ton of messages!

1617
01:36:34,164 --> 01:36:38,005
B of a said they had a power outage, and
Morgan-Stanley said their server crashed!

1618
01:36:38,585 --> 01:36:38,984
Huh!

1619
01:36:39,265 --> 01:36:40,524
That's weird!

1620
01:36:40,524 --> 01:36:43,704
Meh, I will, I will call
it, improbable sue.

1621
01:36:44,784 --> 01:36:46,824
Where do you have our position-mark?

1622
01:36:47,465 --> 01:36:49,024
I think it's the same Mike

1623
01:36:49,284 --> 01:36:51,863
what? Can you explain that to me please?

1624
01:36:51,864 --> 01:36:54,663
H-h-h how can the value
of an insurance-contract

1625
01:36:54,664 --> 01:36:58,863
not be affected by the demise
of the very thing it insures?

1626
01:36:58,864 --> 01:37:01,664
They're independent markets,
they're not always correlated!

1627
01:37:01,885 --> 01:37:05,244
I know it sounds odd,
but these are very complicated products!

1628
01:37:06,305 --> 01:37:08,083
They are correlated!

1629
01:37:08,085 --> 01:37:09,622
They're gonna lose their
houses, they're gonna

1630
01:37:09,635 --> 01:37:11,395
lose their jobs, they're
gonna lose their p..

1631
01:37:14,024 --> 01:37:15,444
Will you listen to me!

1632
01:37:16,185 --> 01:37:18,784
This is like... the end of capitalism!

1633
01:37:18,944 --> 01:37:21,784
This is like the dark ages all-over again!

1634
01:37:23,425 --> 01:37:26,744
I don't want to talk to dad!
Okay, I love you too, save your money!

1635
01:37:27,664 --> 01:37:30,944
She says I need to be on Xanax,
and double my dose of Zoloft

1636
01:37:31,925 --> 01:37:35,704
I asked bear-stearns to price our shorts
they tell me the cdo's still haven't moved

1637
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:36,824
this is fucking insane!

1638
01:37:37,484 --> 01:37:40,545
You realize that? These people are
crooks and they should be in prison!

1639
01:37:41,465 --> 01:37:44,344
Look at the theta-graphics,
you can see that the cdo's are worth zero!

1640
01:37:44,345 --> 01:37:45,583
So you know what they're doing huh?

1641
01:37:45,585 --> 01:37:47,384
You know what they're doing right?
Yeah!

1642
01:37:47,385 --> 01:37:48,564
They're not loading them...

1643
01:37:48,585 --> 01:37:50,404
They're selling their dogshit cdo's

1644
01:37:50,404 --> 01:37:51,884
then they go to another bank

1645
01:37:51,885 --> 01:37:55,625
and short the shit, while they fucking sold
it! Whoo ho ho, let's go to the press man!

1646
01:37:55,744 --> 01:37:58,965
This is a massive story!
Who wouldn't publish it?

1647
01:37:59,965 --> 01:38:01,083
Robert redford!

1648
01:38:01,085 --> 01:38:04,545
Shorting the ones they were gonna buy
I got it, I got it!

1649
01:38:04,685 --> 01:38:06,404
I got it, I got it...

1650
01:38:06,404 --> 01:38:07,744
And what am I supposed to do?

1651
01:38:08,324 --> 01:38:09,704
Want me to write a piece called:
"We're all fucked!"

1652
01:38:09,965 --> 01:38:12,385
Yes! That's a perfect title!

1653
01:38:12,725 --> 01:38:16,224
Right now, every bank in town
is unloading these shit-bonds

1654
01:38:16,225 --> 01:38:18,024
under un-suspecting customers

1655
01:38:18,024 --> 01:38:21,184
and they won't devalue them
until they get them off their books

1656
01:38:21,185 --> 01:38:25,765
this level of criminality is unprecedented
even on fucking wall-street!

1657
01:38:27,204 --> 01:38:28,265
Jamie...

1658
01:38:28,704 --> 01:38:30,064
This is me being honest here okay.

1659
01:38:30,625 --> 01:38:32,864
It took me years to build my
relationships on wall-street

1660
01:38:32,984 --> 01:38:34,545
no bank or ratings-agency

1661
01:38:35,045 --> 01:38:37,024
is gonna confirm a story like this

1662
01:38:37,024 --> 01:38:39,125
just because it comes from two guys in a...

1663
01:38:39,885 --> 01:38:43,284
Garage-band hedge-fund that
thinks it's the apocalypse.

1664
01:38:44,625 --> 01:38:45,625
Wow!

1665
01:38:45,925 --> 01:38:48,765
I thought you were for real Casey
you know, I have to say, I really did!

1666
01:38:50,125 --> 01:38:52,163
Yeah Jamie, you try being for
real with a three-year old

1667
01:38:52,164 --> 01:38:53,805
and a wife getting her masters-degree

1668
01:38:54,425 --> 01:38:57,265
I'm not gonna burn my
reputation on your wild hunch

1669
01:38:58,305 --> 01:38:59,305
wow!

1670
01:39:01,204 --> 01:39:03,564
Thanks for coming guys,
totally fucking awesome to see you!

1671
01:39:03,564 --> 01:39:06,083
Yeah. Casey, I've always hated you

1672
01:39:06,085 --> 01:39:09,784
because you were a prick in college
and you are a prick today!

1673
01:39:10,465 --> 01:39:12,704
Thanks Charlie!
Still living with your mom?

1674
01:39:13,425 --> 01:39:15,064
Charlie, come on!

1675
01:39:15,265 --> 01:39:17,265
It's mark baum again. Call me!

1676
01:39:17,545 --> 01:39:19,104
Sub-prime bonds fell off a cliff

1677
01:39:19,265 --> 01:39:21,465
rumor has it default-numbers are huge!

1678
01:39:21,505 --> 01:39:24,064
Who got their remittance-data early?
I bet it's Goldman

1679
01:39:24,145 --> 01:39:25,623
nah, fuck you very much!

1680
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:28,663
Jared!
It's chaos down here, where are we?

1681
01:39:28,664 --> 01:39:32,085
And Caesar wept,
for there were no more worlds to conquer.

1682
01:39:33,545 --> 01:39:35,045
Shane...

1683
01:39:35,345 --> 01:39:36,784
Shane!

1684
01:39:38,164 --> 01:39:38,824
Well...

1685
01:39:39,145 --> 01:39:41,324
Nobody's buying cdo's and
mortgage bonds anymore

1686
01:39:41,404 --> 01:39:44,984
and everybody wants swaps, swaps are not
he most popular product on the street

1687
01:39:45,085 --> 01:39:46,863
that's good for us! Yes, and no.

1688
01:39:46,864 --> 01:39:48,404
I heard from somebody,
who heard from somebody

1689
01:39:48,404 --> 01:39:50,725
no Alex. No... sorry!

1690
01:39:54,505 --> 01:39:56,323
I'm betting kleeger over
at Morgan is taking

1691
01:39:56,335 --> 01:39:58,125
up some heavy losses
in the bond-department

1692
01:39:59,244 --> 01:40:00,864
your shit might be taking on water

1693
01:40:01,885 --> 01:40:03,543
time to get our life-jacket and get out.

1694
01:40:03,545 --> 01:40:04,324
Holy shit!

1695
01:40:04,465 --> 01:40:05,465
I'm jacked

1696
01:40:06,425 --> 01:40:07,604
I'm jacked!

1697
01:40:07,604 --> 01:40:09,225
I'm jacked to the tits!

1698
01:40:09,824 --> 01:40:10,545
Good!

1699
01:40:10,805 --> 01:40:12,604
Do you feel it? No!

1700
01:40:19,064 --> 01:40:20,864
What'd you hear tiny?

1701
01:40:22,364 --> 01:40:23,364
It's happening

1702
01:40:23,625 --> 01:40:25,345
everybody wants our swaps.

1703
01:40:25,845 --> 01:40:27,284
Kathy's office is looking for you!

1704
01:40:28,305 --> 01:40:30,045
Singing a different tune now, aren't they?

1705
01:40:31,524 --> 01:40:32,524
That's not good.

1706
01:40:37,925 --> 01:40:38,704
Maybe later.

1707
01:40:38,706 --> 01:40:44,125
No, no this isn't a joke
you gotta start unwinding...

1708
01:40:45,225 --> 01:40:46,225
Listening!

1709
01:40:46,784 --> 01:40:47,984
Dr. burry? Yah!

1710
01:40:48,604 --> 01:40:49,984
Deev woonsen, Goldman sachs

1711
01:40:49,984 --> 01:40:51,404
listen, I've been reviewing your position

1712
01:40:51,404 --> 01:40:53,644
I wanted to discuss your marks,
make sure they're fair!

1713
01:40:53,645 --> 01:40:56,385
Yeah, I, I, I thi, I think you mean..
That you've..

1714
01:40:56,944 --> 01:40:59,573
Secured a net-short
position yourselves, so

1715
01:40:59,585 --> 01:41:02,524
you're free to mark my
swaps accurately for once

1716
01:41:02,524 --> 01:41:04,625
because it's now in your interest to do so.

1717
01:41:07,404 --> 01:41:09,663
Ehm... I'm not sure what you want me to say

1718
01:41:09,664 --> 01:41:10,664
I think that...

1719
01:41:12,664 --> 01:41:14,244
I think you've already said it.

1720
01:41:22,505 --> 01:41:26,085
You tell Jeff at Goldman that I'm not
transferring funds, this is bullshit!

1721
01:41:33,704 --> 01:41:34,885
Okay, we'll talk later.

1722
01:41:35,864 --> 01:41:36,904
Thank you...

1723
01:41:39,645 --> 01:41:42,085
Thanks for coming so quickly mark
yeah

1724
01:41:42,244 --> 01:41:43,244
ehm...

1725
01:41:43,364 --> 01:41:46,264
I know you've been hearing rumblings
about some losses Morgan has suffered.

1726
01:41:46,265 --> 01:41:48,725
Congratulations on what?

1727
01:41:49,064 --> 01:41:50,064
Oh!

1728
01:41:50,305 --> 01:41:51,305
Thanks.

1729
01:41:51,625 --> 01:41:53,265
Ehm.. Having fun?

1730
01:41:54,524 --> 01:41:56,085
Yes! He he!

1731
01:41:57,265 --> 01:41:58,725
Tons!, ehm...

1732
01:41:59,024 --> 01:42:00,585
I just wanted you to know that ehm...

1733
01:42:02,064 --> 01:42:05,264
Yes, Morgan has suffered some losses,
but our liquidity is strong,

1734
01:42:05,265 --> 01:42:07,045
and there's no cause for concern!

1735
01:42:07,645 --> 01:42:10,085
Would Benny kleeger be concerned?

1736
01:42:10,904 --> 01:42:14,244
Because word on the street is
he took some pretty heavy losses

1737
01:42:16,425 --> 01:42:19,944
Kathy come on, we know each-other..
How, how?...

1738
01:42:21,164 --> 01:42:22,225
How bad is this?

1739
01:42:22,545 --> 01:42:23,545
Ok...

1740
01:42:24,625 --> 01:42:27,726
Two years ago, Benny kleeger
in Morgan's bond-department

1741
01:42:27,738 --> 01:42:29,923
also started shorting
sub-prime housing

1742
01:42:29,925 --> 01:42:32,583
two million in triple-b's
Benny is smarter than I thought!

1743
01:42:32,585 --> 01:42:33,725
No, he's not smart at all!

1744
01:42:34,145 --> 01:42:36,545
The premiums on the swaps
ate into his desks profit

1745
01:42:36,664 --> 01:42:38,585
to cover his triple-b shorts,

1746
01:42:38,625 --> 01:42:42,005
he sold a lot of a- and double-a
swaps as protection, a lot!

1747
01:42:43,125 --> 01:42:45,604
He believed that there was no way,
that they could be affected.

1748
01:42:46,824 --> 01:42:49,845
Tell me Morgan-Stanley doesn't
hold the contracts on these swaps

1749
01:42:53,244 --> 01:42:54,505
holy shit

1750
01:42:55,505 --> 01:42:58,664
all this time I've been trying to figure
out whom I've been betting against.

1751
01:42:59,244 --> 01:43:00,524
And it's Morgan-Stanley

1752
01:43:01,784 --> 01:43:02,965
which is me...

1753
01:43:05,145 --> 01:43:06,725
What's your exposure?
Three billion?

1754
01:43:08,484 --> 01:43:10,125
Please don't tell me it's more than four!

1755
01:43:10,324 --> 01:43:11,324
I can't answer that!

1756
01:43:11,984 --> 01:43:13,944
Yes you can answer that,
because...

1757
01:43:14,225 --> 01:43:17,585
I walk in here and people
are crying in your hallway

1758
01:43:19,085 --> 01:43:20,085
Kathy..

1759
01:43:20,564 --> 01:43:23,645
You bring me in to tell me everything
is fine, and everything is not fine!

1760
01:43:24,324 --> 01:43:26,064
What? What is happening?

1761
01:43:28,324 --> 01:43:29,824
Long exposure is...

1762
01:43:32,465 --> 01:43:33,824
Fifteen billion

1763
01:43:40,345 --> 01:43:42,048
Jesus Christ, are you fucking
kidding me?! -You kept

1764
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:43,743
saying defaults over eight
percent were impossible!

1765
01:43:43,744 --> 01:43:46,185
That there would be a million homeless
oh my God!

1766
01:43:47,265 --> 01:43:50,345
Yeah, but we have nothing
to do with Morgan-Stanley

1767
01:43:52,864 --> 01:43:55,664
yeah... just tell the bankruptcy-court

1768
01:43:56,284 --> 01:43:59,564
Morgan fails,
all our accounts go under bow and ship

1769
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:01,284
that's just crazy!

1770
01:44:01,805 --> 01:44:04,885
Morgan makes a sucker's bet
and we pay their fucking gambling debt?

1771
01:44:05,885 --> 01:44:08,685
Short the bank's stocks! Wait..

1772
01:44:12,465 --> 01:44:15,005
Or we sell our swaps,
when the market opens

1773
01:44:16,284 --> 01:44:18,505
we get our bonuses,
our investors get their profit

1774
01:44:18,824 --> 01:44:21,704
we get... thirty cents on the dollar,
not bad!

1775
01:44:22,024 --> 01:44:23,564
We're three times up

1776
01:44:23,664 --> 01:44:25,444
not if there's no market up to sell them in

1777
01:44:25,444 --> 01:44:27,524
forget it, I'm not giving
out any life-hooks

1778
01:44:27,524 --> 01:44:29,765
mark, if Morgan goes under,
we end up with nothing!

1779
01:44:29,944 --> 01:44:31,145
Vinnie...

1780
01:44:32,564 --> 01:44:34,085
Jesus, come on!

1781
01:44:34,425 --> 01:44:36,385
I say, when we sell

1782
01:44:40,104 --> 01:44:41,885
look I get that this is personal for you,

1783
01:44:42,664 --> 01:44:46,045
but we have a fiduciary responsibility
no, no we don't!

1784
01:44:46,704 --> 01:44:48,505
Respons...?
Nobody is acting responsible!

1785
01:44:49,045 --> 01:44:51,345
Fuck responsibility!
Are you kidding me?

1786
01:44:52,484 --> 01:44:54,345
The assholes at the big
banks, are gonna take..

1787
01:44:54,385 --> 01:44:57,625
You boys want menu's now?
We're talking!.. Please!

1788
01:44:58,005 --> 01:44:59,685
Excuse us!

1789
01:45:01,645 --> 01:45:04,524
We are going to wait,
and we are going to wait

1790
01:45:04,864 --> 01:45:09,645
we are going to wait, until they feel
the pain, until they start to bleed

1791
01:45:10,585 --> 01:45:11,524
that is what I want

1792
01:45:11,525 --> 01:45:13,863
yeah, but what about our clients, they've
been trusting us with their savings.

1793
01:45:13,864 --> 01:45:15,203
I say when we sell!

1794
01:45:15,204 --> 01:45:16,524
This isn't about you!

1795
01:45:16,524 --> 01:45:19,984
Hey, hey, hey!
I say when we sell!

1796
01:45:21,784 --> 01:45:22,864
Whatever you say mark

1797
01:45:30,145 --> 01:45:31,805
dude, did you hear the news?

1798
01:45:33,824 --> 01:45:36,190
Ok, so not only did two
mortgage hedge-funds

1799
01:45:36,203 --> 01:45:38,104
backed by bear-stearns
go belly-up

1800
01:45:38,104 --> 01:45:41,644
but now, there's a class-action
lawsuit against bear

1801
01:45:41,645 --> 01:45:42,625
holy shit!

1802
01:45:42,626 --> 01:45:45,265
Let's go! Push, push!

1803
01:45:45,305 --> 01:45:48,185
So? What? Bear could really collapse here?
That's a risk we really shouldn't take!

1804
01:45:48,225 --> 01:45:50,725
But eighty percent of our swaps is bear

1805
01:45:50,885 --> 01:45:52,144
we lose everything!

1806
01:45:52,145 --> 01:45:53,765
Hey sir! One second!

1807
01:45:53,864 --> 01:45:55,731
That's my opinion! -Aw,
we bought these fucking

1808
01:45:55,743 --> 01:45:57,543
things, and we have no
clue how to sell them

1809
01:45:57,545 --> 01:45:59,064
I know, we have to get Ben to do it!

1810
01:45:59,064 --> 01:46:00,823
I've been trying to call him,
but he won't get back to me

1811
01:46:00,824 --> 01:46:04,885
no, he's on vacation with his
wife's family! They're in england!

1812
01:46:05,345 --> 01:46:06,345
What?!

1813
01:46:14,284 --> 01:46:15,344
Hello, Ben? Hey!

1814
01:46:15,345 --> 01:46:17,404
Guys?
Yeah, we're here, can you hear us?

1815
01:46:17,564 --> 01:46:19,885
Guys?- We hear ya, yeah!

1816
01:46:20,185 --> 01:46:22,505
I probably got cell-phone and wifi-service

1817
01:46:23,244 --> 01:46:25,545
I'm trying to sell 200 million
dollars worth of securities

1818
01:46:26,164 --> 01:46:27,164
in a pub...

1819
01:46:27,645 --> 01:46:28,725
Smells like sheep

1820
01:46:28,925 --> 01:46:29,704
you can do this!

1821
01:46:29,805 --> 01:46:31,560
I don't want to pressure
you Ben, but if you

1822
01:46:31,573 --> 01:46:33,145
don't pull this off,
we lose everything!

1823
01:46:34,085 --> 01:46:36,625
Ok, let's see what credit
suisse's appetite is.

1824
01:46:42,484 --> 01:46:45,564
This is brownfield fund, I'm wanting
to unload my credit default swaps.

1825
01:46:46,005 --> 01:46:47,005
Alright, what've you got?

1826
01:46:47,625 --> 01:46:49,444
Twenty double-a tranches of abs cdo's

1827
01:46:49,925 --> 01:46:52,363
eh yes.. But these eh...
These are pretty bad

1828
01:46:52,364 --> 01:46:53,805
absolutely, they're complete shit!

1829
01:46:54,765 --> 01:46:57,664
What's your.. What's your?
Basevalue is two-hundred and five million

1830
01:46:58,064 --> 01:46:59,064
dollars

1831
01:46:59,305 --> 01:47:01,425
alright, we could, we could go to forty

1832
01:47:01,944 --> 01:47:03,264
no, we want at least a hundred million

1833
01:47:03,265 --> 01:47:04,585
a hundred million?

1834
01:47:04,885 --> 01:47:07,024
Who are you a drug-dealer or a banker?

1835
01:47:07,164 --> 01:47:09,364
Cause if you're a banker
you can fuck right off!

1836
01:47:09,765 --> 01:47:12,064
I don't know if we can make a market,
just give me your best price!

1837
01:47:12,064 --> 01:47:14,823
Yeah, check! A hundred million worth,
and aim higher!

1838
01:47:14,824 --> 01:47:15,904
I think we're far apart

1839
01:47:16,585 --> 01:47:18,625
look if you don't want
to deal, just hang up.

1840
01:47:21,524 --> 01:47:22,925
That's what I thought!

1841
01:47:23,805 --> 01:47:24,885
Ninety million

1842
01:47:24,944 --> 01:47:26,104
seventy!

1843
01:47:27,164 --> 01:47:28,164
Eighty-five

1844
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:31,104
seventy-eight eightyfour!

1845
01:47:31,845 --> 01:47:33,685
Seventy-eight eightyfour!

1846
01:47:35,965 --> 01:47:37,164
It's Dr. burry

1847
01:47:37,704 --> 01:47:40,645
looks like the collapse of the
financial sector is imminent

1848
01:47:41,625 --> 01:47:43,284
start to sell my position

1849
01:47:43,885 --> 01:47:45,204
2.3 billion

1850
01:47:47,125 --> 01:47:48,564
sure, I'll hold!

1851
01:48:12,885 --> 01:48:14,324
So I was right.

1852
01:48:15,225 --> 01:48:16,984
I took a rash of shit for two years. But...

1853
01:48:18,125 --> 01:48:19,744
I was right! And...

1854
01:48:20,545 --> 01:48:21,645
Everyone was wrong!

1855
01:48:23,005 --> 01:48:24,444
And yeah I got a bonus-cheque for it

1856
01:48:25,104 --> 01:48:26,125
sue me!

1857
01:48:26,784 --> 01:48:27,784
You know.

1858
01:48:28,484 --> 01:48:31,145
It's a lot of money!
I get it, I can feel you judging me.

1859
01:48:31,984 --> 01:48:32,984
That's palpable

1860
01:48:34,024 --> 01:48:35,064
but hey!

1861
01:48:35,864 --> 01:48:37,864
I never said I was the hero of this story

1862
01:48:38,725 --> 01:48:39,885
hey, hey babe!

1863
01:48:40,185 --> 01:48:41,625
How are we looking?

1864
01:48:42,425 --> 01:48:43,784
Ace... goi..

1865
01:48:44,725 --> 01:48:45,725
S-sorry?

1866
01:48:46,145 --> 01:48:48,363
No, eighty million!
Ok, so eighty million!

1867
01:48:48,364 --> 01:48:50,324
Eighty million, eigthy million,
that's good right?

1868
01:48:50,505 --> 01:48:54,685
Eighty is great, no eighty is great,
thank you, thank you so much!

1869
01:48:55,364 --> 01:48:56,765
Most of them went to ubs

1870
01:48:57,284 --> 01:48:58,305
you're very lucky!

1871
01:48:58,744 --> 01:49:02,404
The largest bank in France froze it's
customer's money-market accounts today

1872
01:49:02,404 --> 01:49:03,564
this thing is hitting Europe!

1873
01:49:04,045 --> 01:49:05,425
Greece and Iceland are finished

1874
01:49:06,005 --> 01:49:07,064
Spain is teetering

1875
01:49:07,345 --> 01:49:09,125
are you serious? Fuck!

1876
01:49:09,284 --> 01:49:11,184
Ben call us when you get home!

1877
01:49:11,185 --> 01:49:14,185
But hey, before you go...
I'm just wondering...

1878
01:49:15,404 --> 01:49:16,404
Uhm..

1879
01:49:17,904 --> 01:49:19,744
Why did you do this with us?

1880
01:49:21,164 --> 01:49:25,345
You didn't have to, and eh..
You know, thank you, but, eh...

1881
01:49:26,125 --> 01:49:27,125
Why?

1882
01:49:27,685 --> 01:49:30,064
You guys said you wanted to get rich!
Now you're rich!

1883
01:49:38,145 --> 01:49:40,261
As the housing-markets
and banks continues to

1884
01:49:40,274 --> 01:49:42,864
hemorrhage, only one of the
big shorts refused to sell.

1885
01:49:43,265 --> 01:49:44,265
Mark baum

1886
01:49:47,845 --> 01:49:49,877
so it was beyond perfect,
when he was asked to

1887
01:49:49,890 --> 01:49:51,804
speak at a conference
opposite Bruce Miller

1888
01:49:51,805 --> 01:49:53,664
famous bull-ish investor

1889
01:49:54,685 --> 01:49:56,123
after he and mark had their debate

1890
01:49:56,125 --> 01:50:00,305
Alan greenspan, one of the architects of
the whole crisis, was scheduled to speak

1891
01:50:00,725 --> 01:50:03,725
everyone in mark's office showed up,
even invited friends!

1892
01:50:04,744 --> 01:50:08,463
This... was the Ali versus
foreman of the financial world

1893
01:50:08,465 --> 01:50:10,305
realists versus the fools

1894
01:50:10,925 --> 01:50:13,185
and if it seems almost too perfect...
Trust me!

1895
01:50:13,465 --> 01:50:14,465
This happened!

1896
01:50:16,545 --> 01:50:18,185
Welcome everyone!

1897
01:50:19,005 --> 01:50:22,244
Please... give a generous welcome to...

1898
01:50:23,404 --> 01:50:26,145
Mister Bruce Miller... and mark baum

1899
01:50:43,925 --> 01:50:45,564
strap yourself in!

1900
01:50:46,704 --> 01:50:51,604
So as some of you may know, bear-stearns
has just received a loan from j.P. Morgan

1901
01:50:51,604 --> 01:50:54,524
of course we're gonna have to see
how the markets react

1902
01:50:54,524 --> 01:50:58,064
but that should lay to rest
any concerns about the bank self!

1903
01:50:58,364 --> 01:51:02,484
No, I take it, you have no plans to sell
your two-hundred million in bear-stock

1904
01:51:03,425 --> 01:51:06,704
no, as a matter of fact, when we're done
here, I'll probably go buy some more!

1905
01:51:08,385 --> 01:51:11,824
For the opposing view...
Mister baum

1906
01:51:14,345 --> 01:51:16,265
I gotta stand for this

1907
01:51:19,204 --> 01:51:20,324
okay, hi!

1908
01:51:21,064 --> 01:51:23,225
My firms thesis is pretty simple

1909
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:27,465
wall-street took a good idea:
Lewis raneiri's mortgage-bonds

1910
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:31,965
and turned it into an atomic bomb
of fraud and stupidity

1911
01:51:32,385 --> 01:51:35,064
that's on it's way to
decimating the world economy

1912
01:51:35,104 --> 01:51:36,104
how do you really feel?

1913
01:51:37,805 --> 01:51:41,625
I'm glad you still have a sense of humor!
I wouldn't if I were you!

1914
01:51:42,164 --> 01:51:45,345
Now, anyone who knows me, knows..

1915
01:51:45,944 --> 01:51:48,984
That I have no problem telling
someone they're wrong.

1916
01:51:48,984 --> 01:51:52,224
It's a disaster, it just says here,
they got a liquidity-bravo

1917
01:51:52,225 --> 01:51:54,465
but for the first time.. In my life..
Holy fuck!

1918
01:51:54,845 --> 01:51:56,664
It's not so enjoyable

1919
01:51:57,484 --> 01:51:59,604
we live in an era of fraud in America

1920
01:52:00,164 --> 01:52:02,465
not just in banking, but in government

1921
01:52:03,064 --> 01:52:04,805
education, religion

1922
01:52:05,425 --> 01:52:07,305
food, even baseball

1923
01:52:08,364 --> 01:52:09,864
what bothers me...

1924
01:52:10,225 --> 01:52:12,984
Isn't that .. Fraud is not nice

1925
01:52:13,064 --> 01:52:15,244
or that fraud... is mean

1926
01:52:15,364 --> 01:52:17,845
it's that .. For fifteen thousand years

1927
01:52:18,284 --> 01:52:22,204
fraud and short-sighted thinking
have never ever worked

1928
01:52:22,645 --> 01:52:25,304
not once, eventually Jesus

1929
01:52:25,305 --> 01:52:27,024
you'll get caught
we're at thirtyseven

1930
01:52:27,765 --> 01:52:30,264
things go South! -It's fucking
plummeting man, it's fucking plummeting!

1931
01:52:30,265 --> 01:52:31,965
When the hell did we forget all that?

1932
01:52:36,744 --> 01:52:38,965
I thought we were better
than this, I really did

1933
01:52:39,465 --> 01:52:40,465
and..

1934
01:52:40,524 --> 01:52:44,524
The fact that we're not, doesn't
make me feel all-right and superior!

1935
01:52:44,524 --> 01:52:47,125
It makes me feel... sad.

1936
01:52:47,284 --> 01:52:51,444
Every time I fucking hit refresh it's
dropping man -and hope it does goes down!

1937
01:52:51,465 --> 01:52:53,024
And as fun as it is to watch..

1938
01:52:53,425 --> 01:52:55,844
Pompous dumb wall-streeters be wildly wrong

1939
01:52:55,845 --> 01:52:57,784
and you are wrong sir!

1940
01:52:59,085 --> 01:53:01,305
I just know that at the end of the day

1941
01:53:02,564 --> 01:53:05,097
average people are going
to be the ones, -that

1942
01:53:05,109 --> 01:53:07,385
are going to have to
pay for all of this.

1943
01:53:08,204 --> 01:53:10,524
Because they always, always do!
Thirtytwo?

1944
01:53:10,524 --> 01:53:12,885
Shit! It's thirty-two
yeah it's fucking tanked man

1945
01:53:13,225 --> 01:53:14,704
that's my two cents, thank you!

1946
01:53:16,345 --> 01:53:17,845
I'm gonna drop a deuce at deutsche

1947
01:53:17,925 --> 01:53:19,505
does our bull have a response?

1948
01:53:20,984 --> 01:53:23,505
Only that in the entire
history of wall-street,

1949
01:53:24,744 --> 01:53:28,805
no investment-bank has ever failed,
unless caught in criminal activities.

1950
01:53:29,385 --> 01:53:32,725
So, yes!
I stand by my bear-stearns optimism.

1951
01:53:33,404 --> 01:53:35,064
Mister Miller, I'm sorry!
Quick question!

1952
01:53:35,965 --> 01:53:38,113
From the time you guys started
talking, bear-stearns'

1953
01:53:38,125 --> 01:53:40,045
stock is falling more
than thirty-eight percent

1954
01:53:41,005 --> 01:53:42,005
would you still buy more?

1955
01:53:42,145 --> 01:53:43,904
Yeah, sure!

1956
01:53:44,505 --> 01:53:45,885
Ofcourse I'd buy more, why not?

1957
01:53:46,824 --> 01:53:47,824
Baum!

1958
01:53:51,204 --> 01:53:56,085
Jesus Christ! Oh no! That comcludes
the first part of our presentation

1959
01:53:57,904 --> 01:54:04,225
up next, we have the legendary, former,
chairman of the fed, Alan greenspan!

1960
01:54:04,944 --> 01:54:06,784
Folks!

1961
01:54:23,284 --> 01:54:26,073
Employees of lehmann
brothers today, -as

1962
01:54:26,086 --> 01:54:28,823
the wall-street giant's
stock went to zero!

1963
01:54:28,824 --> 01:54:31,184
The collapse of the venerable New York bank

1964
01:54:31,185 --> 01:54:34,074
follows a tumultuous
few months of market

1965
01:54:34,087 --> 01:54:37,265
volatility, and fear for
the world economy...

1966
01:54:37,885 --> 01:54:39,484
I gotta see inside

1967
01:54:40,385 --> 01:54:41,385
how?

1968
01:54:42,664 --> 01:54:43,664
Come on

1969
01:54:44,345 --> 01:54:47,404
I left my phone in the office,
I threw my pass out already,

1970
01:54:47,404 --> 01:54:49,536
do you mind if I take your pass?
Borrow it? I don't

1971
01:54:49,547 --> 01:54:51,484
give a shit anymore, you
can do what you want!

1972
01:54:59,145 --> 01:55:01,636
Go directly to your
transportation, do not talk to

1973
01:55:01,649 --> 01:55:04,003
the press! -So that's it?
After eighteen years!

1974
01:55:04,005 --> 01:55:06,832
Go directly to your transportation,
do not talk to the press! -I just

1975
01:55:06,844 --> 01:55:09,845
leave? That's just fucking great, I
can talk to whomever the hell I want!

1976
01:55:09,864 --> 01:55:12,184
Do not talk to the press!

1977
01:55:12,185 --> 01:55:16,164
Go directly to your transportation,
do not talk to the

1978
01:55:17,984 --> 01:55:20,345
hey look, you want to get a bit tonight?
There's this ehm...

1979
01:55:20,585 --> 01:55:23,844
This new Cuban place just opened at the
lower east side, so I suppose we could..

1980
01:55:23,845 --> 01:55:25,185
Ah really? Yeah!

1981
01:55:26,085 --> 01:55:27,085
You and I?

1982
01:55:27,664 --> 01:55:30,385
Yeah and eh.. Other people
that sounds nice!

1983
01:55:30,545 --> 01:55:32,704
Yeah, I would like that, thank
you very much! -Finally!

1984
01:55:33,005 --> 01:55:34,024
Mark, hey!

1985
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:35,784
It's a bloodbath up here.

1986
01:55:36,085 --> 01:55:38,703
Morgan's stock has lost half its value,
it's down to 23,10

1987
01:55:38,704 --> 01:55:42,064
it's in a free-fall decline, so I wanted
to talk to you about pulling their money

1988
01:55:42,505 --> 01:55:44,604
I mean... it's now or never mark!

1989
01:55:45,444 --> 01:55:46,505
We gotta sell!

1990
01:55:49,944 --> 01:55:50,944
Mark!

1991
01:55:52,824 --> 01:55:54,024
Mark, do you hear me?

1992
01:55:54,024 --> 01:55:58,225
Mailbox ♪1, you have fifteen messages.

1993
01:55:59,925 --> 01:56:01,659
Mike I can't seem to get
a hold of you, could you

1994
01:56:01,671 --> 01:56:03,391
please call me at your
earliest convenience?

1995
01:56:05,444 --> 01:56:08,163
It's Jeff, I.. Eh.. You're buying stocks?

1996
01:56:08,164 --> 01:56:10,725
The market is at an all-time
low, this is crazy!

1997
01:56:11,604 --> 01:56:13,725
I met my wife on match. Com

1998
01:56:14,404 --> 01:56:18,064
my profile said that I'm a medical student
with only one eye

1999
01:56:18,404 --> 01:56:19,744
an awkward social manner,

2000
01:56:20,345 --> 01:56:23,524
and 145 thousand dollars in student loans

2001
01:56:24,604 --> 01:56:25,604
she wrote back...

2002
01:56:26,244 --> 01:56:28,005
You're just what I've been looking for!

2003
01:56:28,824 --> 01:56:32,284
She meant honest, so let me be honest...

2004
01:56:32,564 --> 01:56:36,923
The housing-crisis represents
the greatest financial opportunity

2005
01:56:36,925 --> 01:56:39,204
making money is not what
I thought it would be.

2006
01:56:40,164 --> 01:56:43,213
This business... kills
the part of life that is

2007
01:56:43,225 --> 01:56:46,925
essential! The part, that has
nothing to do with business

2008
01:56:50,085 --> 01:56:55,225
for the past two years, my insides have
felt, like they're eating themselves.

2009
01:56:55,864 --> 01:56:57,524
All the people I respected,

2010
01:56:58,484 --> 01:57:00,904
won't talk to me anymore

2011
01:57:01,244 --> 01:57:02,645
except through lawyers.

2012
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:07,944
People...

2013
01:57:09,005 --> 01:57:12,805
Want an authority to tell them how to value
things, but they chose this authority

2014
01:57:13,685 --> 01:57:17,085
not based on facts or... results

2015
01:57:18,545 --> 01:57:23,425
they chose it because it seems
authoritative... or familiar!

2016
01:57:23,484 --> 01:57:24,484
And...

2017
01:57:25,265 --> 01:57:28,585
I'm not, and never have been... familiar

2018
01:57:31,085 --> 01:57:32,085
so..

2019
01:57:33,104 --> 01:57:38,064
So I've come to the solemn realization
that I must close down the fund

2020
01:57:38,965 --> 01:57:41,345
sincerely, Michael j. Burry md.

2021
01:58:41,944 --> 01:58:43,765
This isn't how I pictured it

2022
01:58:45,925 --> 01:58:47,944
what do you think you'd find?
I don't know

2023
01:58:50,024 --> 01:58:51,064
grown-ups

2024
01:58:55,425 --> 01:58:56,585
mark, are you there?

2025
01:58:59,805 --> 01:59:00,805
Mark?

2026
01:59:00,925 --> 01:59:04,585
Paulsson and bernanke just
left the white house.

2027
01:59:09,404 --> 01:59:11,185
There's going to be a bail-out

2028
01:59:13,204 --> 01:59:14,324
well, they had to!

2029
01:59:15,545 --> 01:59:16,545
Right?

2030
01:59:17,085 --> 01:59:19,085
We paid for mortgages with collaterals
they knew!

2031
01:59:19,564 --> 01:59:22,326
Cash would have stopped coming out the atm,
they had to back-stop this

2032
01:59:23,085 --> 01:59:25,506
they knew the tax-payers
would bail them out,

2033
01:59:25,518 --> 01:59:27,845
they weren't stupid,
they just didn't care!

2034
01:59:28,045 --> 01:59:29,765
Yeah, 'cause they're fucking crooks!

2035
01:59:31,364 --> 01:59:33,625
But, at lest we're gonna see
some of them go to jail.

2036
01:59:35,824 --> 01:59:36,824
Right?

2037
01:59:37,204 --> 01:59:38,925
We need to gonna have to break up the banks

2038
01:59:40,604 --> 01:59:43,744
the party is over!
I don't know, I don't know...

2039
01:59:46,925 --> 01:59:49,806
I have a feeling, that in
a few years, people are

2040
01:59:49,819 --> 01:59:52,944
gonna do, what they always
do when the economy tanks.

2041
01:59:53,984 --> 01:59:57,045
They will be blaming
immigrants and poor people.

2042
01:59:57,404 --> 01:59:58,545
But mark was wrong!

2043
01:59:59,904 --> 02:00:02,307
In the years that followed,
hundreds of bankers

2044
02:00:02,319 --> 02:00:04,583
and rating-agency's
executives went to jail.

2045
02:00:04,585 --> 02:00:06,765
The scc was completely overhauled

2046
02:00:07,085 --> 02:00:09,904
and congress had no choice,
but to break up the big banks

2047
02:00:09,904 --> 02:00:12,524
and regulate the mortgage
and derivative industries

2048
02:00:17,324 --> 02:00:18,725
just kidding!

2049
02:00:19,005 --> 02:00:21,284
Banks took the money
the American people gave them

2050
02:00:21,345 --> 02:00:23,623
and used it to pay themselves huge bonuses

2051
02:00:23,625 --> 02:00:25,784
and lobby the congress to kill big reform

2052
02:00:26,145 --> 02:00:28,364
and then they blamed
immigrants and poor people

2053
02:00:28,585 --> 02:00:29,925
and this time even teachers!

2054
02:00:31,845 --> 02:00:34,965
And when all was said and done,
only one single banker went to jail

2055
02:00:35,784 --> 02:00:36,784
this poor schmuck!

2056
02:00:36,984 --> 02:00:39,923
Kareem serageldin from credit suisse

2057
02:00:39,925 --> 02:00:42,045
he hit a few billion in
mortgage-bond losses

2058
02:00:42,185 --> 02:00:45,345
something most of the big banks
did on a good day during the crisis

2059
02:00:47,204 --> 02:00:48,585
mark, can we sell now?

2060
02:00:50,484 --> 02:00:52,444
I mean the fund will almost
make a billion dollars

2061
02:00:53,604 --> 02:00:55,324
you'll clear two-hundred mill mark!

2062
02:00:56,465 --> 02:00:58,204
You know... once we sell..

2063
02:00:59,305 --> 02:01:00,765
We'll be just like the rest of them

2064
02:01:01,524 --> 02:01:02,524
you know that!

2065
02:01:02,864 --> 02:01:04,545
No we're not, we're not the bad guys here!

2066
02:01:04,744 --> 02:01:09,204
We didn't defraud the American people
and prey on their dreams of owning a home

2067
02:01:09,345 --> 02:01:10,345
like they did!

2068
02:01:11,885 --> 02:01:13,305
Now we get to kick em in the teeth!

2069
02:01:19,524 --> 02:01:20,845
A billion dollars

2070
02:01:23,164 --> 02:01:24,164
that's right!

2071
02:01:24,385 --> 02:01:26,765
But we gotta close out our position,
or it could be zero.

2072
02:01:27,645 --> 02:01:30,305
I- I-it's now or never, mark

2073
02:01:39,805 --> 02:01:40,904
okay.

2074
02:01:44,864 --> 02:01:45,885
Sell it all!

2075
02:05:54,104 --> 02:05:57,005
