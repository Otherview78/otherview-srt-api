1
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,582
Bio readouts are all in the green. Looks like she's alive.

2
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,064
Well, there goes our salvage, guys.

3
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,663
- How are we today? - Oh. Terrible.

4
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,630
Well, better than yesterday, at least.

5
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,431
- Where am I? - You're safe.

6
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,941
You're at Gateway Station. Been here a couple of days.

7
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,467
You were pretty groggy at first, but now you're okay.

8
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,020
Oh, looks like you've got a visitor.

9
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,267
Jonesy. Come here.

10
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,548
Hey, come here.

11
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,987
How are you, you stupid cat?

12
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,025
How are you? Where have you been?

13
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,946
Guess you two have met, huh? I'm Burke. Carter Burke.

14
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,548
I work for the company, but don't let that fool you. I'm really an okay guy.

15
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,783
I'm glad to see you're feeling a little better.

16
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,387
They tell me that all the weakness and disorientation should pass soon.

17
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,382
That's just natural side effects of such an unusually long hypersleep, or something like that.

18
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,662
What do you mean?

19
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,107
How long was I out there?

20
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,308
Inhalation Therapy, report to...

21
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,621
Has no one discussed this with you yet?

22
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,702
No. But, I mean...

23
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,785
I don't... recognize this place.

24
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,862
No, I know. Uh...

25
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,661
Okay. It's just that, uh, this might be a shock to you.

26
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,386
- It's long... - How long?

27
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,462
Please.

28
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,431
- 57 years. - What?

29
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,789
That's the thing. You were out there for 57 years.

30
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,989
What happened was you had drifted right through the core systems.

31
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,904
And it's really just blind luck...

32
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,189
that a deep-salvage team found you when they did.

33
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,581
It's one in a thousand, really.

34
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,382
I think you're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo. You could be floating out there forever.

35
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,669
You... You okay?

36
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,584
Uhh...

37
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,831
Uuh!

38
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,181
You okay?

39
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,501
Oh-h-h! Oh, God!

40
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,467
- Nurse! Please! - God!

41
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,590
Someone get in here now!

42
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,708
Now!

43
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,987
- Hold! - Please.

44
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,301
Hold on!

45
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,382
Kill me!

46
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,985
No!

47
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,062
Uh!

48
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,903
Bad dreams again? You want something to help you sleep?

49
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,221
No.

50
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,302
I've slept enough.

51
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,461
Jonesy.

52
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,582
Come here.

53
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,742
Shh.

54
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,022
It's all right.

55
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,820
It's all right now.

56
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,948
It's over.

57
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:14,142
Dr. Hirsch, 334. Dr. Hirsch, 334.

58
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,700
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I've been running behind all morning.

59
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,590
Is there any word about my daughter?

60
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,062
Uh... I really think we should worry about the hearing now.

61
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,542
'Cause we don't have a lot of time, okay? I read your deposition, and it's great.

62
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,669
If you just stick to that, I think we'll be fine. The thing to remember is,

63
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,756
there're gonna be a lot of heavyweights in there.

64
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,836
You've got feds and Interstellar Commerce Commission,

65
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,989
Colonial Administration, insurance company guys...

66
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,631
Do you have any news about my daughter?

67
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,304
Well, we did come up with some information. Why don't we sit down?

68
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,463
I was hoping to wait until after the inquest.

69
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,542
Um...

70
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,590
"Amanda Ripley-McClaren"... married name, I guess...

71
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,822
"Age 66."

72
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,221
And that was at the time of her death,

73
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,625
which was two years ago.

74
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,942
I'm real sorry.

75
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,023
Amy.

76
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,862
She was cremated and interred at Westlake Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.

77
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,308
No children. I checked.

78
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,671
I promised her... that I'd be home for her birthday.

79
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,550
Her 11th birthday.

80
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,661
I'd just like to go, uh...

81
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,940
back to this point about the override destruct order.

82
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,621
- Is it in the file? - I don't understand this.

83
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,021
We have been here for three and a half hours.

84
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,740
Now, how many different ways do you want me to tell the same story?

85
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:10,422
Look at it from our perspective, please.

86
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,502
Please?

87
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,386
Now, you freely admit to detonating the engines of,

88
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,304
and thereby destroying, an M-class star freighter,

89
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,860
a rather expensive piece of hardware.

90
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,149
Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.

91
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,985
That's minus payload, of course.

92
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,463
The lifeboat's flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account,

93
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,580
in that, for reasons unknown, the Nostromo set down on LV-426,

94
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,222
an unsurveyed planet at that time, that it resumed its course...

95
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,227
and was subsequently set for self-destruct by you for reasons unknown.

96
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,621
Not for reasons unknown. I told you.

97
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:56,469
We set down there on company orders to get this thing, which destroyed my crew...

98
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,020
and your expensive ship.

99
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,786
The analysis team, which went over the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter,

100
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,989
found no physical evidence of the creature you describe.

101
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,110
Good! That's because I blew it out of the goddamn air lock,

102
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,862
like I said.

103
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,228
Are there any species like this hostile organism on LV-426?

104
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,780
No. It's a rock. No indigenous life.

105
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,387
Did I.Q.'s just drop sharply while I was away?

106
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,861
Ma'am, I already said it was not indigenous.

107
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,671
It was a derelict spacecraft. It was an alien ship.

108
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:38,342
It was not from there. Do you get it? We homed in on its beacon.

109
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,230
And found something never recorded once...

110
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,827
in over 300 surveyed worlds.

111
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,701
- "A creature that gestates inside a living human host." - Yes.

112
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,705
These are your words. "And has concentrated acid for blood."

113
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,021
That's right.

114
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,025
Look. I can see where this is going,

115
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,541
but I'm telling you that those things exist.

116
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,876
- Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will be all. - Please. You're not listening to me.

117
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,426
Kane, the crew member...

118
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,221
Kane, who went into that ship, said he saw thousands of eggs there.

119
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,388
- Thousands. - Thank you. That will be all.

120
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,508
Goddamn it, that's not all!

121
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,301
Because if one of those things gets down here, then that will be all!

122
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,996
Then all of this... this bullshit that you think is so important...

123
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,820
You can just kiss all of that good-bye!

124
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,901
It is the finding of this court of inquiry that...

125
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,062
Warrant Officer E. Ripley,

126
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,223
NOC14472,

127
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,065
has acted with questionable judgment...

128
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,543
and is unfit to hold an I.C.C. license as a commercial flight officer.

129
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,702
Said license is hereby suspended indefinitely.

130
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,909
Now, no criminal charges will be filed against you at this time,

131
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,221
and you are released on your own recognizance...

132
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,110
for a six-month period of psychometric probation,

133
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,710
to include monthly review by an I.C.C. psychiatric technician.

134
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,390
These proceedings are closed.

135
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,468
That could have been better.

136
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,027
- Look, I think the... Ripley? - Van Leuwen.

137
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,343
Why don't you just check out LV-426?

138
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,186
Because I don't have to. There have been people there for over 20 years,

139
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,988
- and they never complained about any hostile organism. - What do you mean? What people?

140
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,189
Terraformers. Planet engineers.

141
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,026
They go in, set up these big atmosphere processors to make the air breathable.

142
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,341
Takes decades.

143
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,701
It's what we call a "Shake 'N Bake" colony.

144
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,421
How many are there? How many colonists?

145
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,983
I don't know... 60, maybe 70 families. Do you mind?

146
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,662
Families.

147
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,948
Jesus.

148
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,626
- I'll be down in maintenance, okay? - AI!

149
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,623
- What? - Hey, AI.

150
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,902
- What? - Remember you sent some wildcatters...

151
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,830
out to the middle of nowhere last week, out past the Ilium Range?

152
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,831
- Yeah, what? - One of them's on the horn, a mom-and-pop survey team.

153
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,716
He says he's onto something. He wants to know if his claim will be honored.

154
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,788
Why wouldn't his claim be honored?

155
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,036
Well, because you sent them to that particular middle-of-nowhere on company orders, maybe.

156
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,587
- I don't know. - Christ! Some honch in a cushy office on Earth...

157
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,788
says, "Go look at a grid reference."

158
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,069
We look. They don't say why, and I don't ask.

159
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,310
I don't ask, because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here, and the answer is always...

160
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,269
"Don't ask."

161
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,508
So what do I tell this guy?

162
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,789
Tell him as far as I'm concerned, if he finds something, it is his.

163
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,789
- Lydecker? - What?

164
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,471
You kids know you're not supposed to be on this level!

165
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,947
Go on! Get outta here!

166
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,705
- Do too. You go in places we can't fit. - So? That's why I'm the best.

167
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,468
Knock it off! I catch either of you playing in the air ducts again, I'll tan your hides.

168
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,781
Mom, all the kids play...

169
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,471
Wait a minute. Annie, come and have a look at this, will ya?

170
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,150
Folks, we have scored big this time.

171
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,110
What is it, Dad?

172
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,670
I'm not sure.

173
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,636
Let's see if we can't get a closer look at this thing, maybe through that crack there on the side.

174
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,790
- Shouldn't we call in? - Let's wait till we know what to call it in as.

175
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,902
That's about as close as we can get.

176
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,063
Should we take a look inside?

177
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,903
You two stay inside. I mean it. We'll be right back.

178
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,028
- Okay. - Bye.

179
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,783
Huh?

180
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,989
Timmy, they've been gone a long time.

181
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,461
It'll be okay, Newt. Dad knows what he's doing.

182
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:40,383
Mayday, Mayday! This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner calling...!

183
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,430
This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner!

184
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,220
Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner calling calling Alpha Control!

185
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,707
Hiya, Ripley. This is Lieutenant Gorman...

186
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,949
of the Colonial Marine Corps...

187
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,261
Ripley, we have to talk.

188
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,061
We've lost contact with the colony on LV-426.

189
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,747
I don't believe this.

190
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,422
You guys throw me at the wolves, and now you want me to go back out there?

191
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,071
Forget it. It's not my problem.

192
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,781
- Can I finish? - No. There's no way.

193
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,302
Ripley, you wouldn't be going in with the troops.

194
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,701
I can guarantee your safety.

195
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,306
These Colonial Marines are very tough hombres.

196
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,270
They're packing state-of-the-art firepower.

197
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,700
There's nothing they can't handle.

198
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,221
- Lieutenant, am I right? - That's true.

199
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,462
We've been trained to deal with situations like this.

200
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,226
Then you don't need me. I'm not a soldier.

201
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,906
Yeah, but we don't know exactly what's going on out there.

202
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,631
It may just be a downed transmitter, okay?

203
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,149
But if it's not, I would like you there as an adviser,

204
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,302
and that's all.

205
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,110
What's your interest in all this? Why are you going?

206
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,269
Corporation cofinanced that colony,

207
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,820
along with Colonial Administration.

208
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,780
We're getting into a lot of terraforming now. "Building Better Worlds"...

209
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,346
Yeah, yeah. I saw the commercial.

210
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,344
Look, I don't have time for this. I've got to get to work.

211
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,549
Oh, right. I heard you're working the cargo docks.

212
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,622
That's right.

213
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,431
- Running loaders and forklifts, that sort of thing? - Yeah. So?

214
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,709
Nothing. I think it's great that you're keeping busy.

215
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,260
And I know it's the only thing that you could get.

216
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,183
There's nothing wrong with it.

217
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,906
What would you say if I told you I could get you reinstated...

218
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,948
as a flight officer?

219
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,543
- The company's already agreed to pick up your contract. - If I go.

220
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,590
Yeah, if you go.

221
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,822
Come on. That's a second chance, kiddo.

222
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,716
I think, personally, for you, it would be the best thing in the world...

223
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,630
to get out there and face this thing, get back on the horse.

224
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,624
Spare me, Burke. I've had my psych evaluation this month.

225
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,870
Yeah, I know. I've read it. You wake up every night. Your sheets are soaking with sweat...

226
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,181
I said no, and I mean it!

227
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,870
Now, please leave. I am not going back.

228
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,262
And I am... I would not be any good to you if I did.

229
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,469
Okay. Shh.

230
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,387
Would you do me a favor? Just think about it.

231
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,508
Thanks for the coffee.

232
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,022
Oh!

233
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,503
Hello.

234
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,265
Ripley.

235
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,947
- You okay? - Just tell me one thing, Burke.

236
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,342
You're going out there to destroy them, right?

237
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,347
Not to study, not to bring back, but to wipe them out.

238
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,470
That's the plan. You have my word on it.

239
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,226
All right. I'm in.

240
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,580
I think that...

241
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,741
And you, you little shithead,

242
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,664
You're staying here.

243
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,542
Mmm.

244
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,666
They ain't payin' us enough for this, man.

245
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,186
Not enough to have to wake up to your face, Drake.

246
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,260
What?

247
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,380
Is that a joke?

248
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,542
Oh, I wish it were.

249
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:42,587
Hey, Hicks. Man, you look just like I feel.

250
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,551
All right, sweethearts. What are you waiting for?

251
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,749
Breakfast in bed? Another glorious day in the corps.

252
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,347
A day in the Marine Corps is like a day on the farm...

253
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:58,381
every meal's a banquet, every paycheck a fortune, every formation a parade.

254
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,184
- I love the corps! - Christ!

255
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,103
Man, this floor is freezing!

256
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,384
- What do you want me to do? Fetch your slippers for ya? - Gee, would you, sir? I'd like that.

257
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,703
Look into my eye. Fall in, people.

258
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,067
Come on. Let's go.

259
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,108
I hate this job.

260
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,956
- Crowe, Wierzbowski. Come on. On your feet. - We got some slack coming, right?

261
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,870
- You had three weeks on your back, Frost. - What do you want?

262
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,307
I'm talking about breathing, not this frozen shit.

263
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,701
Yeah, Top. How 'bout it?

264
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,984
All right. First assembly's in 15, people. Shag it.

265
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,871
Hey, Mira. Who's Snow White?

266
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,422
She's supposed to be some kind of consultant.

267
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,741
Apparently, she saw an alien once.

268
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,869
- Whoopee-fuckin'-do! - Hey, I'm impressed.

269
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,022
¡Que bonita!

270
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,470
Hey, Vasquez. Have you ever been mistaken for a man?

271
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,588
No. Have you?

272
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,507
Ha, ha! Oh, Vasquez. You're just too bad.

273
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,949
Uhh!

274
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,906
Hey, Top, what's the op?

275
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,108
It's a rescue mission. You'll love it.

276
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,902
There's some juicy colonists' daughters we have to rescue from their virginity.

277
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,187
Dumb-ass colonists.

278
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,381
- What's this crap supposed to be? - Vasquez.

279
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,583
- Corn bread, I think. - It's good for you, boy. Eat it.

280
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,664
Hey, sure wouldn't mind getting some more of that Arcturian poontang.

281
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:40,911
- Remember that time? - Yeah. Except the one that you had was male.

282
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,551
Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian.

283
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,101
Hey, Bishop, man. Do the thing with the knife. Oh, please.

284
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,666
Oh, come on. Yeah.

285
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,708
All right! Yeah.

286
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,387
- I don't want to see that, man. - Come on, man. All right. All right.

287
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,430
Hey, what are you doing, man? Hey what are you doing?

288
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,716
- Come on. Quit messing around, Drake. - Hudson, shut up!

289
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,346
- Bishop, hey, man. - Do it, Bishop!

290
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,981
- Hey! Not me, man! Quit messing around! - Yeah, you! Don't move.

291
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,387
Trust me.

292
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,583
Aah!

293
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,070
There you go, short shit. APONE: All right. Knock it off, knock it off.

294
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,142
Thank you.

295
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,622
Enjoy your meal.

296
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,465
That wasn't funny, man.

297
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,109
- Lieutenant Gorman? Mr. Burke? - Yeah, thanks.

298
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:44,391
Looks like the new lieutenant's too good to eat with the rest of us grunts.

299
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,943
Boy's definitely got a corncob up his ass.

300
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,745
Thought you never miss, Bishop.

301
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,870
You never said anything about an android being on board. Why not?

302
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,990
It never... never occurred to me.

303
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,143
It's just common practice. We always have a synthetic on board.

304
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,700
I prefer the term "artificial person" myself.

305
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,669
Right.

306
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,391
- Is there a problem? - I'm sorry.

307
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,423
I don't know why I didn't even...

308
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,902
Ripley's last trip out, the syn... the artificial person malfunctioned.

309
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,861
- Malfunctioned? - There were problems and a few deaths were involved.

310
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,183
I'm shocked. Was it an older model?

311
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,911
The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A2.

312
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,586
That explains it then. The A2s always were a bit twitchy.

313
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,391
That could never happen now with our behavioral inhibitors.

314
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,068
It is impossible for me to harm, or by omission of action, allow to be harmed, a human being.

315
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,350
You sure you don't want some?

316
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,026
You just stay away from me, Bishop. You got that straight?

317
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,142
Guess she don't like the corn bread, either.

318
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,630
- Squad, ten-hut! Officer on deck! - As you were.

319
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,544
Quickly, quickly. Settle down.

320
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,624
All right. Listen up!

321
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,740
Morning, marines. I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief you people before we left Gateway...

322
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,346
- Sir? - What is it, Hicks?

323
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,503
Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.

324
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,504
What's the question?

325
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:34,386
Is this gonna be a stand-up fight, sir, or another bug hunt?

326
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,585
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony...

327
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,504
and that a xenomorph may be involved.

328
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,351
- Excuse me, sir. A what? - A xenomorph.

329
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,661
It's a bug hunt.

330
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,462
- What exactly are we dealing with here? - Ripley.

331
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,941
I'll tell you what I know.

332
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,461
We set down on LV-426.

333
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:00,545
One of our crew members was brought back on board with something attached to his face,

334
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,146
some kind of parasite.

335
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,541
We tried to get it off. It wouldn't come off.

336
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,544
Later, it seemed to come off by itself and die.

337
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,191
Kane seemed fine.

338
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,388
We were all having dinner, and, um,

339
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,624
it must have laid something inside his throat, some sort of embryo.

340
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,711
- He started... Um, he... - Look, man.

341
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,820
I only need to know one thing... where they are.

342
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,705
- Yo, Vasquez. Kick ass. - Anytime, anywhere man.

343
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:34,627
Right, right. Somebody said "alien." She thought they said "illegal alien", and signed up.

344
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,708
- Fuck you, man. - Anytime, anywhere.

345
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,431
Are you finished?

346
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,311
I hope you're right. I really do.

347
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,623
Yeah, okay, right. Thank you, Ripley.

348
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,624
We also have Ripley's report on disk. I suggest you study it.

349
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:00,621
Because just one of those things managed to wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours.

350
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,465
And if the colonists have found that ship, then there's no telling...

351
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,190
how many of them have been exposed.

352
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,706
Do you understand?

353
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,703
Anyway, we have it on disk, so you better look at it.

354
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,465
Any questions?

355
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,907
What is it, Private?

356
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,024
How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?

357
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,829
You secure that shit, Hudson.

358
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,582
All right.

359
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,504
Now listen up.

360
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,028
I want this thing to go smooth...

361
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,671
and by the numbers.

362
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,143
I want D.C.S. and tactical database assimilation by 08:30.

363
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,300
Ordinance loading, weapons strip and drop-ship prep details...

364
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,747
- will have seven hours. - Oh, come on.

365
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,982
Now, move it, people!

366
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,791
All right, sweethearts. You heard the man, and you know the drill.

367
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:56,104
Assholes and elbows! Hudson, come here. Come here.

368
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,302
I don't care if you are short, Hudson. Get it done.

369
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,986
Hey, Sarge. You'll get lip cancer smoking those.

370
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,189
Corporal, I want this loading lock sealed. Now!

371
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,746
- How many more you got, Spunkmeyer? - Last one.

372
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,868
Good. Take it away.

373
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,382
Clear behind.

374
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,191
- Did you check number three? - Let me see that.

375
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,185
Hi. I feel like kind of a fifth wheel around here. Is there anything I can do?

376
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,661
I don't know. Is there anything you can do?

377
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,861
Well, I can drive that loader.

378
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,626
I have a Class 2 rating.

379
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,782
Be my guest.

380
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,265
Where you want it?

381
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,787
Bay 12, please.

382
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,587
All right, sweethearts. We're a team, and there's nothing to worry about.

383
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,182
We come here, and we gonna conquer, and we gonna kick some.

384
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,190
- Is that understood? That's what we gonna do, sweethearts. - Yes, sir.

385
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,627
- We are going to go and get some. - Hey.

386
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,465
All right, people! On the ready line!

387
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,345
- Are you lean? Are you mean? - Yeah! Yeah!

388
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,066
- What are you? What are you? - Lean and mean!

389
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,950
Hudson! Get on the ready line, marine!

390
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,944
Get some today! Get on the ready line!

391
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,024
- Yo! - Move it out! Move it out, goddamn it!

392
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,661
Get hot! One, two, three! Get out, get out, get out!

393
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,301
Move it out, move it out, move it out! Move it out, move it out, move it out!

394
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,701
Absolutely badasses.

395
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,181
Let's pack 'em in. Get in there!

396
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,228
All right! Move it!

397
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,025
- Let's go, let's go! - One, two, three,

398
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,582
four, five, six!

399
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:58,029
All right. I want combat seating. You know your places.

400
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,421
Get those weapons stowed. Let's go.

401
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,822
Come on. Settle down, people.

402
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,982
Lock 'em in, Hudson.

403
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:09,508
- Ready to get it on? - You know it!

404
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,265
Okay, Bishop, let's go.

405
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,502
Roger.

406
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,031
I'm ready, man.

407
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,622
Ready to get it on! Go!

408
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:30,785
Stand by. Cross-locking now. Prelaunch autocycle engaged.

409
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:38,025
Primary couplers released. Hit the internals.

410
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,311
Shit, man. FERRO: Confirm cross-lock and drop stations secured.

411
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,510
Affirmative. All drop stations secured.

412
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,706
Stand by. Ten seconds.

413
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,390
Stand by to initiate release sequencer... on my mark.

414
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:14,148
Five, four, three, - We're on an express elevator to hell, going down.

415
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,190
Two, one, mark.

416
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,747
Woo-hoo!

417
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,389
- Switch to D.C.S. ranging. - 240, nominal to profile.

418
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,191
We're in the pipe, five by five.

419
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,062
We're picking up some hull ionization.

420
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,620
Got it. Rough air ahead.

421
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,941
We're in for some chop.

422
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,901
How many drops is this for you, Lieutenant?

423
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,661
Thirty-eight.

424
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,708
Simulated.

425
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,942
How many combat drops?

426
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:27,070
Uh, two... including this one.

427
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,462
- Shit. - Oh, man!

428
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,384
Range 014. Turning on final.

429
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,150
And I'm telling you, I got a bad feeling about this drop.

430
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,676
You always say that, Frost. You always say, "I got a bad feeling about this drop."

431
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,146
Okay, okay. When we get back without you,

432
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,264
I'll call your folks.

433
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,630
All right. Let's see what we can see.

434
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,187
Everybody online. Looking good.

435
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,307
Drake, check your camera. There seems to be a malfunction.

436
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,988
That's better. Pan it around a bit.

437
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,143
- Good. - I'm ready, man. Check it out.

438
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,343
- I am the ultimate badass. - Yeah. That's right.

439
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:34,864
- State-of-the-badass art. You do not want to fuck with me. - Who here's runnin'?

440
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,830
Check it out.

441
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,791
Hey, Ripley, don't worry.

442
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,023
Me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you.

443
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,023
- Hey! - That's right.

444
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,262
Check it out.

445
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,901
Independently targeting particle-beam phalanx.

446
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,621
Fry half a city with this puppy.

447
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,067
We got tactical smart missiles,

448
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,586
phase-plasma pulse rifles, R.P.G.'s.

449
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:05,107
- We got sonic, electronic ballbreakers! - Whoo!

450
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,548
We got nukes, we got knives, sharp sticks...

451
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,544
Knock it off, Hudson. All right, gear up.

452
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:15,420
Two minutes, people. Get hot.

453
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,229
Somebody wake up Hicks.

454
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,146
Coming around for a 709er.

455
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:36,150
- Terminal guidance locked in. - Where's the damn beacon?

456
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,746
Oh, I see it.

457
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,188
- That's the atmosphere processor? - Yep, that's it.

458
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,582
Remarkable piece of machinery. Completely automated.

459
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,231
You know, we manufacture those, by the way.

460
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:09,065
Okay, Ferro. Take us in low over the main colony complex.

461
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,868
Storm shutters are sealed.

462
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:16,511
There's no visible activity. All right. Hold at 40.

463
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:19,784
- Roger. - Give me a slow circle of the complex.

464
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:31,984
Structure seems intact. They still have power.

465
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:36,304
Okay, Ferro. Set down on the landing grid.

466
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,304
Immediate dust off on my clear, then stay on station.

467
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,621
Down and clear.

468
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,982
Ten seconds, people. Look sharp.

469
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:05,342
All right. I want a nice, clean dispersal this time.

470
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,102
Let's go! Move it out!

471
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,182
Head 'em up!

472
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:36,310
First squad up on line. Hicks, get yours in accord and watch the rear.

473
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:40,021
Vasquez, take point. Let's move!

474
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,348
Move up.

475
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,349
Hudson, run a bypass.

476
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,664
Second squad, move up. Flanking positions.

477
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:05,471
Second squad on line.

478
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,582
You set?

479
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,622
Go on.

480
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,984
Second team, move inside. Hicks, take the upper level.

481
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:42,026
Sir, you copying this? Looks like hits from small-arms fire.

482
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,183
Uh, we got some explosives damage.

483
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,501
It's probably seismic survey charges.

484
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:51,386
Are you reading this? Keep it tight, people.

485
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:08,631
All right. Hicks, Hudson, use your motion trackers.

486
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,788
Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.

487
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,544
Quarter and search by twos.

488
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,910
Okay. Dietrich, Frost, you're up.

489
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,943
It's right in there.

490
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,142
- Now! - Now!

491
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:59,021
- Haah! Uh... - Good one, Hudson!

492
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:04,231
Uh, sir, uh, we have a negative situation here. Uh, movin' on, sir.

493
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,270
Wait. Wait, tell him to...

494
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,981
Hicks, back up. Pan right.

495
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:27,704
- There. - You seeing this all right?

496
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:33,350
Looks melted. Somebody must have bagged one of Ripley's bad guys here.

497
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,388
Acid for blood.

498
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:39,067
If you like that, you're gonna love this.

499
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,944
Quit screwing around.

500
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,784
Second squad, what's your status?

501
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,023
Uh, we just finished our sweep. Nobody's home.

502
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,671
Roger. Sir, this place is dead.

503
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,391
Whatever happened here, I think we missed it.

504
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:08,465
All right. The area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.

505
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,384
- Wait a minute. It's not secure. - The area's secured, Ripley.

506
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,269
First team, head for operations.

507
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,624
- Hudson, see if you can get their C.P.U. on line. - Affirmative.

508
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:21,187
- Hicks, meet me at the south lock. We're coming in. - Roger.

509
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,582
He's comin' in. I feel safer already.

510
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,708
Pendejo, jerk-off.

511
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:50,711
Sir, we got the C.P.U. on line. No problem.

512
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,505
Good. Stand by in Operations.

513
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,548
Okay, let's go.

514
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,584
Are you all right?

515
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,464
Yes.

516
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:42,065
Sir, they sealed off this wing at both ends,

517
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:45,383
welded the doors and blocked off the stairs with heavy equipment.

518
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,505
Mm-hmm. But it looks like the barricade didn't hold.

519
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,748
- Any bodies? - No, sir.

520
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,743
Last stand.

521
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,300
Must have been a hell of a fight.

522
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,986
Yeah, looks that way.

523
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,062
All right, Drake, this way.

524
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,144
We should be able to cut through the med lab to Operations.

525
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,863
Lieutenant.

526
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,702
Gorman.

527
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,264
Are those the same ones that...

528
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,548
Careful, Burke.

529
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:51,065
Looks like love at first sight to me.

530
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,507
Oh, he likes you, Burke.

531
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,186
Two are alive. The rest are dead.

532
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:01,030
"Surgically removed before embryo implantation."

533
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:05,822
"Subject Marachek, John J., died during the procedure."

534
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,346
They killed him taking it off.

535
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:12,584
Yo, Hicks.

536
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,231
I think we got something here.

537
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,948
- Behind us. - One of us?

538
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:26,747
Apone, where are your people? Anybody in "D" block?

539
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,664
Ah, that's a negative. We're all in Operations.

540
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,708
Talk to me, Frosty.

541
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,748
Let's keep moving, baby.

542
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,148
- It's moving. - Which way?

543
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,781
It's coming straight for us. Straight up.

544
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,268
- Fuck! - Hold up.

545
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,350
Ripley.

546
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:05,943
Hey. Shh. It's all right.

547
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,347
- It's all right. Come on. - Just grab her, Corporal.

548
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:11,503
Don't be afraid. Come on. We won't hurt you.

549
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,867
Shh. It's all right. It's okay.

550
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,147
Come on out. Come on.

551
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,302
- Easy. Easy. - I got her.

552
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:20,303
Ow! Damn!

553
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:23,145
- Watch her! She's under the grille! - Don't let her go.

554
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,548
- Frost, get your light up here. - Where'd she go?

555
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:33,260
- Shine the light. - Here. Here.

556
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,109
- Here. Here. - There she is.

557
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,786
Keep back. Keep back. Don't scare her.

558
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,585
- Grab her, man. We're gonna lose her. - Damn it!

559
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,783
Kick it out!

560
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,983
Wait.

561
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:17,630
It's okay. It's all right.

562
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:22,420
Don't be afraid.

563
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,548
See?

564
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,583
Wait. No, you don't.

565
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:30,107
It's okay. You're gonna be all right now.

566
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:32,302
Shh.

567
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:36,544
Easy. Easy. It's gonna be okay.

568
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:39,146
It's all right. You're gonna be okay.

569
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,268
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

570
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:44,423
Easy. Easy.

571
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:22,946
- What's her name again? - Rebecca.

572
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:26,991
Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.

573
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,904
Just start at the beginning.

574
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:33,029
Where are your parents?

575
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,307
Now, look, Rebecca, you have to try and help...

576
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:38,031
Gorman, give it a rest, why don't you?

577
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:43,105
Total brain lock.

578
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,103
Physically, she's okay.

579
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:48,423
Borderline malnutrition, but I don't think there's any permanent damage.

580
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,901
Come on. We're wasting our time.

581
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,781
Try this.

582
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,227
It's a little hot chocolate.

583
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,146
There you go.

584
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:11,427
Whoop.

585
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,468
That good, huh?

586
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:21,307
Uh-oh. I made a clean spot here.

587
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:25,180
Now I've done it. Guess I'll have to do the whole thing.

588
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:38,301
Hard to believe there's a little girl under all this.

589
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,462
And a pretty one too.

590
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,106
You don't talk much, do you?

591
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,068
Smoking or nonsmoking?

592
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,063
Just tell me what you're scanning for, Private.

593
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:04,063
- P.D.T.s. - What?

594
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:06,063
Personal data transmitters.

595
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:08,711
Every colonist had one surgically implanted.

596
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:11,943
If they're within 20 klicks, we'll read it out here.

597
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,182
So far, zippo.

598
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,224
I don't know how you managed to stay alive,

599
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,667
but you're one brave kid, Rebecca.

600
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,628
N-Newt.

601
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:29,147
- What'd you say? - Newt.

602
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,427
My name's Newt.

603
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:36,631
Nobody calls me Rebecca except my brother.

604
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:40,586
Newt? I like that.

605
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:44,466
I'm Ripley. It's nice to meet you.

606
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,583
And who is this, hmm?

607
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:53,421
- Casey. - Hello, Casey.

608
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,470
What about your brother? What's his name?

609
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,588
Timmy.

610
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:03,143
Is Timmy around here too? Maybe hiding like you were?

611
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:08,148
Any sisters?

612
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,663
Mom and dad?

613
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,789
Newt, look at me. Where are they?

614
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:23,909
They're dead, all right? Can I go now?

615
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:29,500
I'm sorry, Newt.

616
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,151
Don't you think you'd be safer here with us?

617
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,068
These people are here to protect you.

618
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,108
They're soldiers.

619
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:43,030
It won't make any difference.

620
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,548
Need anything else?

621
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:04,070
Hello, Bishop. Do you need anything else?

622
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,988
No.

623
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:12,188
That's a nice pet you got there, Bishop.

624
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:15,184
Magnificent, isn't it?

625
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:20,300
Yo! Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen! Found 'em.

626
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:22,946
- They alive? - Unknown,

627
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:24,943
but it looks like all of them.

628
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:29,230
Over at the processing station, Sublevel 3,

629
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,746
under the main cooling towers.

630
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:35,586
Looks like a goddamn town meeting.

631
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,583
Let's saddle up, Apone.

632
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,981
Aye, sir.

633
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,631
All right. Let's go, people. They ain't payin' us by the hour.

634
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,708
Let's go. Head 'em out!

635
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,782
Okay, Frost, you're driving.

636
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:02,027
It's okay. Don't worry. It'll be okay.

637
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:46,585
I want a straight "V", deployment, second team on left flank.

638
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,710
Advance on axial 664. Tracker on line.

639
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,909
Set the "V" gain to filter R.F. ambient.

640
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:57,502
Hudson, tracker on line. Left and right, little buddy.

641
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:03,504
Forty meters in, bearing 221, there should be a stairwell.

642
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:05,548
Check. Got it.

643
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:08,943
You want Sublevel 3.

644
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,381
Let's go, people. Hudson, you got the point.

645
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,861
Hicks, watch our tails.

646
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:19,103
Nice and easy. Check those corners.

647
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,467
Check those corners.

648
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:27,471
- Watch your spacing. - All right. You heard the man.

649
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,463
Don't bunch up. Stay loose.

650
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:32,305
Uh, your transmission's showing a lot of breakup.

651
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:36,590
Probably getting some interference from the structure.

652
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,788
Use those lights.

653
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:43,263
Next one down, and proceed on a 216.

654
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,502
Uh, roger. That's a 216.

655
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:50,744
I'm not making that out too well. What is it, Hudson?

656
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:53,790
You tell me, man. I only work here.

657
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,942
What is that?

658
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:13,261
I don't know.

659
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:17,261
Proceed inside.

660
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:35,950
Watch your fire and check your targets.

661
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:38,341
Remember we're looking for civvies in here.

662
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,063
Easy.

663
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,620
Tighten it up, Frost. We're getting a little thin.

664
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,707
Nice and easy.

665
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:00,909
Looks like some sort of secreted resin.

666
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:04,786
Yeah, but secreted from what?

667
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:07,551
Nobody touch nothing.

668
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:10,590
Busy little creatures, huh?

669
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:12,947
Hot as hell in here.

670
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:14,943
Yeah, man, but it's a dry heat.

671
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,988
Knock it off, Hudson.

672
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,222
Lieutenant, what do those pulse rifles fire?

673
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:30,707
Ten millimeter explosive-tip case less.

674
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,748
Standard light armor-piercing round.

675
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:35,061
- Why? - Well, look where your team is.

676
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:38,423
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.

677
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,502
So?

678
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:44,301
So if they fire their weapons in there, won't they rupture the cooling system?

679
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:48,624
- Ho, ho, ho. Yeah. She's absolutely right. - So? So what?

680
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:52,944
Look. This whole station is basically a big fusion reactor.

681
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:55,387
Right?

682
01:08:55,460 --> 01:09:00,148
So you're talking about a thermonuclear explosion, and adios, muchachos.

683
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,871
Oh, great. Wonderful.

684
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:05,750
Shit!

685
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:11,546
Look. Uh... Apone.

686
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:16,307
Look. We can't have any firing in there.

687
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:20,146
I, uh, I want you to collect magazines from everybody.

688
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:24,270
- Is he fuckin' crazy? - What the hell are we supposed to use, man, harsh language?

689
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:27,184
- Flame units only. I want rifles slung. - Sir, I...

690
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:30,230
Just do it, Sergeant. And no grenades.

691
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:36,825
All right, sweethearts. You heard the man. Pull 'em out. Come on. Let's have 'em.

692
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,751
Come on, Vasquez. Clear and lock.

693
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,907
Damn!

694
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,108
You too. Give it up, Ski. Come on. Let's go.

695
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:50,150
Crowe, I want it now. Give it up.

696
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:52,188
Right on, Vas.

697
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,383
Let's go, marine. Give it up.

698
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,588
Frost, you got the duty. Open that bag.

699
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:00,550
- Thanks a lot, Sarge. - Hicks, cover our ass.

700
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:02,543
Head 'em out, people.

701
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:08,227
I like to keep this handy... for close encounters.

702
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:10,223
I heard that.

703
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:21,063
Any movement?

704
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:23,825
Nothing. Zip.

705
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,941
Holy shit.

706
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:54,266
Newt, go sit up front.

707
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:56,866
Go on! Now!

708
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,265
Steady, people. Let's finish our sweep.

709
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:31,742
We're still marines, and we got a job to do.

710
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:35,541
Keep it moving. Easy.

711
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:09,190
- Help! - What?

712
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:12,025
- Top, get over here. We got a live one! - You're gonna be all right.

713
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:15,263
Please... K-kill me.

714
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:18,230
Just stay calm. We're gonna get you outta here.

715
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,956
It's gonna be all right. Give me a hand. We gotta get her outta here.

716
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:23,347
- What is it, Dietrich? - Convulsion!

717
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:26,105
Dietrich, get back!

718
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,581
Get back!

719
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:38,988
- No! - Frost, flamethrower. Kill it!

720
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,711
- Get back! - Flamethrower! Move!

721
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:13,224
Movement!

722
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:18,067
- What's the position? - I can't lock in!

723
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,541
Talk to me, Hudson!

724
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:23,783
Uh, Multiple signals.

725
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,988
They're closing.

726
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:29,382
Go to infrared, people. Look sharp!

727
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,782
What's happening, Apone? Can't see anything in here.

728
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:34,783
Pull your team out, Gorman.

729
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:43,385
I got signals. I got readings in front and behind.

730
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,701
Where, man? I don't see shit.

731
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:48,260
He's right. There's nothing back here.

732
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,900
Look, I'm telling you. There's something moving, and it ain't us!

733
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:55,864
- Oh, shit. - Tracker's off scale, man.

734
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:59,228
They're all around us, man! Jesus!

735
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:02,224
Maybe they don't show up on infrared at all.

736
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,980
Frost!

737
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,068
Come on!

738
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,106
Jesus Christ, Apone! What is going on?

739
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:33,104
Wierzbowski and Crowe are down!

740
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:37,225
- Dietrich, Frost, off the board! - Dietrich, Crowe! Sound off! Frost!

741
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:39,900
Frost!

742
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:45,107
Wierzbowski?

743
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:47,911
Wierzbowski?

744
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:51,706
Let's rock!

745
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,070
Who's firing? Goddamn it!

746
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:58,266
Yeah!

747
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:02,430
- I ordered to hold fire. - They're coming out of the walls!

748
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,867
They're coming out of the goddamn walls! Let's book!

749
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:07,187
- On the right, man. - Uh, Apone,

750
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:10,025
I want you to... lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators...

751
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:12,865
Vasquez, Drake, hold your fire, goddamn it!

752
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:16,865
Apone, are you copying me? I want you to lay down suppressing fire...

753
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:19,560
with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the A.P.C.

754
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:21,947
- Over. - Say again, all after "incinerator."

755
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:26,708
I said I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back...

756
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:29,391
by squads to the A.P.C. Over.

757
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,347
Hey!

758
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,701
- Sarge! Sarge! - Apone.

759
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:38,226
- Talk to me. Apone? - Copy! Copy!

760
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,587
- Talk to me, Apone. - He's gone!

761
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:44,627
- Get them out of there! - Shut up!

762
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:46,630
- Do it now! - Shut up!

763
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:49,756
- Hicks, whoever's left, get the hell out of there... Goddamn it! - Just shut up!

764
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:54,183
- It's coming out of the goddamn walls! - Where's Apone? Where's Apone?

765
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:56,581
The sarge is gone! Let's get the fuck out of here!

766
01:15:56,660 --> 01:16:00,460
Let's move it! Let's go, marine!

767
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:03,623
Hudson? Vasquez?

768
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:06,823
- Hudson, look out! - Get it!

769
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:09,942
Watch it!

770
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:12,421
- Hicks. - Come on. Behind you! Fall back!

771
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:16,130
- I told them to fall back. I told them to fall back. - Fall back, goddamn it, now!

772
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:17,983
- They're cut off! - Hudson, move your ass!

773
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,029
- Do something! - Let's go, marine!

774
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:22,068
Fuck!

775
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:25,150
- Come on. Keep moving, baby. - Hold on, Newt.

776
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:34,183
Ripley, what the hell are you doing?

777
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,829
Turn around!

778
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:47,581
That's an order!

779
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:54,542
- Get off me, damn it! - Goddamn it, that's an order!

780
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:57,351
You had your chance, Gorman.

781
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:10,583
Come on!

782
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:32,791
Come on. Let's move it!

783
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:35,227
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

784
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:38,747
It's blocked, man. We gotta go around!

785
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:43,621
- Open the door! Hicks! - Drake, we are leaving!

786
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,702
Get them, man!

787
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:49,186
Run for it!

788
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:52,706
Shit!

789
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:58,748
- Go! Go! - Come on, man! Come on!

790
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:10,711
Drake, come on!

791
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:15,461
No!

792
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:20,384
- Fire in the hole! - He's gone!

793
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:22,349
Put it out! Put it out! Go! Go!

794
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:26,141
- Come on. Put it out! - Drake's coming, man!

795
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:29,230
- Drake! No, he's not! - He's gone!

796
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,588
Forget him! He's gone!

797
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:40,343
They're in the goddamn door!

798
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:46,511
Eat this!

799
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:49,663
Ripley!

800
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:52,061
Go, go, go!

801
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:56,749
It's all right! We're clear!

802
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,261
Ripley, you've blown the transaxle!

803
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:01,263
You're just grinding metal!

804
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,547
Come on, ease down.

805
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,708
Ease down.

806
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:09,546
Ease down. Ease down.

807
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:23,461
You okay?

808
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,868
- I'm all right. - Hudson.

809
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:29,022
Get away from me, man!

810
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:33,145
- Lieutenant. - What happened to Gorman?

811
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:36,463
I don't know. Maybe a concussion.

812
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,861
- But he's alive. - No, he's dead!

813
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:41,022
Wake up, pendejo, and then I'm gonna kill you!

814
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:44,309
Back off. Right now.

815
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:48,943
- Somebody get me a first aid kit. - Fuck!

816
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:52,149
Hey. Hey, look.

817
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:55,542
The sarge and Dietrich aren't dead, man.

818
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,622
Their signs are real low, but they ain't dead.

819
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,941
- Then we go back in there and get them. - Fuck that!

820
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:02,516
- We don't leave our people behind... - I ain't going back in there.

821
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:04,986
You can't help them!

822
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:09,748
You can't. Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.

823
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:18,304
- Oh, dear Lord Jesus, this ain't happenin', man. - Damn it.

824
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:21,463
This can't be happenin', man. This isn't happenin'!

825
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:25,101
All right. We got seven canisters of CN-20.

826
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:28,502
I say we roll them in there and nerve gas the whole fucking nest.

827
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:31,385
That's worth a try, but we don't even know if it's gonna affect them.

828
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:35,943
Let's just bug out and call it even. Okay? What are we talking about this for?

829
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:39,741
I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.

830
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:44,543
It's the only way to be sure.

831
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:47,863
- Fuckin' "A"! - Hold on. Hold on one second.

832
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:52,150
This installation has a substantial dollar value attached to it.

833
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:54,700
They can bill me.

834
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:59,866
Okay, look. This is an emotional moment for all of us, okay?

835
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:03,342
I know that. But let's not make snap judgments, please.

836
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:06,390
This is clearly... clearly an important species we're dealing with,

837
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:09,225
and I don't think that you or I or anybody has the right...

838
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:12,383
- to arbitrarily exterminate them. - Wrong.

839
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,030
Yeah. Watch us.

840
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:16,387
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events,

841
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,151
but we just got our asses kicked, pal!

842
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:22,588
Look. I'm not blind to what's going on,

843
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:25,266
but I cannot authorize that kind of action.

844
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,422
I'm sorry.

845
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:31,464
Well, I believe Corporal Hicks...

846
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:33,508
has authority here.

847
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:36,909
Corporal Hicks is...

848
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:39,387
This operation is under military jurisdiction,

849
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:41,383
and Hicks is next in chain of command.

850
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:43,622
Am I right, Corporal?

851
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:45,668
Yeah.

852
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:49,340
Yeah, that's right.

853
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:51,635
- Yeah. Look, Ripley. - Yes.

854
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,066
This is a multimillion-dollar installation, okay?

855
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:56,063
He can't make that kind of decision.

856
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:58,746
He's just a grunt. Uh, no offense.

857
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:02,586
- None taken. Ferro, do you copy? - Standing by.

858
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:05,345
Prep for dust off. We're gonna need immediate evac.

859
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:07,343
Roger. On our way.

860
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:12,028
I say we take off, nuke the site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.

861
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:16,424
Let's do it.

862
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:27,061
Let's go. Pick it up, Hudson. Pick it up, baby.

863
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:34,422
All right. Set him down here.

864
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,068
Move it, Spunkmeyer. We're rolling.

865
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:50,149
Hold on a second. There's something...

866
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:52,547
Just get up here.

867
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:55,146
I'm in. Ramp closing.

868
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:16,828
Spunkmeyer.

869
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:21,706
Goddamn it.

870
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:24,101
Well, where the fuck...

871
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:38,783
Run!

872
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:23,460
Well, that's great. That's just fuckin' great, man.

873
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:26,020
Now what the fuck are we supposed to do?

874
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,387
We're in some real pretty shit now, man!

875
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:30,861
Are you finished?

876
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:35,662
You all right?

877
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:45,070
I guess we're not gonna be leaving now, right?

878
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,744
I'm sorry, Newt.

879
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:50,785
- You don't have to be sorry. It wasn't your fault. - That's it, man.

880
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:53,261
Game over, man! Game over!

881
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:55,946
What the fuck are we gonna do now? What are we gonna do?

882
01:25:56,020 --> 01:26:00,469
Maybe we could build a fire. Sing a couple of songs, huh? Why don't we try that?

883
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:03,305
We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon,

884
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:06,748
and they mostly come at night, mostly.

885
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:27,585
That's everything, right? All right. This is absolutely everything...

886
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:30,664
that we could salvage out of the A.P.C. wreckage.

887
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:34,347
We got four pulse rifles with about 50 rounds each.

888
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:36,548
That ain't so good.

889
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:40,341
We got, uh, 15 of these M-40 grenades.

890
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:42,343
Don't touch that.

891
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:44,906
- Dangerous, honey. - Is that the only flamethrower?

892
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:49,070
Yeah. It's only half full, but it's functional.

893
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:52,906
Got another one, it's damaged... I don't know about that one.

894
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:58,783
But the good news... we got four of these robot sentries,

895
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:01,909
with display and scanners intact.

896
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:05,143
They really kick ass. I think they'll come in handy.

897
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:09,669
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?

898
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,828
Seventeen days.

899
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:17,391
Seventeen days?

900
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:21,351
Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your parade, but we're not gonna last 17 hours.

901
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:25,156
Those things are gonna come in here just like they did before. And they're gonna come in here...

902
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:28,263
- Hudson! Hudson! - They're gonna come in here and they're gonna get us!

903
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:30,388
This little girl survived longer than that...

904
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:33,509
with no weapons and no training.

905
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:35,503
Right?

906
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:40,585
Why don't you put her in charge?

907
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:43,510
You'd better just start dealing with it, Hudson. Listen to me.

908
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:45,782
Hudson, just deal with it because we need you.

909
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:47,783
And I'm sick of your bullshit.

910
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:51,467
Now, I want you to get on a terminal and call up some kind of floor plan file.

911
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:54,225
Do you understand? Construction blueprints. I don't care.

912
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:56,756
Anything that shows the layout of this place. Are you listening?

913
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:59,863
- Yeah. - I need to see air ducts.

914
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:03,342
I need to see electrical access tunnels, subbasements,

915
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:07,141
every possible way into this complex.

916
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:11,669
- We don't have much time. - Okay.

917
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:14,101
- Okay, I'm on it. - Hudson!

918
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:18,868
Just relax.

919
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:27,300
I'll be in med lab. I'll check on Gorman, continue my analysis.

920
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:30,304
Fine. You do that.

921
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:40,386
So this service tunnel must be how they're moving back and forth.

922
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:42,940
That's right. It moves from the processing station...

923
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:45,387
right into the sublevel here.

924
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:50,742
Come down on that. Okay, come over.

925
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:54,063
Hold. Go back. Okay, punch that in right there.

926
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:01,782
No. It's back here. Okay.

927
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:05,951
Well, there's a pressure door at this end.

928
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:10,702
Couldn't we put one of the remote sentry units in the tunnel, and then seal that door?

929
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:13,784
Yeah, that'll work, but we gotta figure on them getting into the complex.

930
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:18,866
That's right, so... we repair the barricades at these two intersections.

931
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:21,665
- Right. - And weld plate steel over these ducts...

932
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:26,143
here and here and here.

933
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:29,224
That way they can only come at us from these two corridors.

934
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:34,989
All right. Then we put the other sentry units here, and here, right?

935
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:37,546
- Right. - Outstanding.

936
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:39,588
Now all we need is a deck of cards.

937
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,982
All right, people. Let's move like we got a purpose.

938
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:46,865
- Affirmative. - Affirmative.

939
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:05,786
Do your thing, baby. Come on, Come on, Vasquez. Let's get the hell outta here.

940
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:08,750
Hudson here. "A" and "B" sentries are in place and keyed.

941
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:13,667
Roger. Stand by. Arming now. Test it, Hudson.

942
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:16,181
- Do it! - Fire in the hole!

943
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:22,230
Okay, great. Let's get the hell outta here!

944
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:25,782
We're sealing the tunnel. Come on, baby.

945
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:39,863
For what it's worth.

946
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:44,107
Here. I want you to put this on.

947
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,741
- What's it for? - It's a locator.

948
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:51,302
Then I can find you anywhere in the complex on this.

949
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:57,225
- It's just a precaution. - Thanks.

950
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,110
Doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.

951
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:02,182
All right, what's next?

952
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:33,828
Last stop.

953
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:39,743
Get in.

954
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:43,950
Scoot down. That's good.

955
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:48,070
Now, you lie here and have a nap. You're very tired.

956
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:51,508
I don't want to. I have scary dreams.

957
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:56,983
Well, I bet Casey doesn't have scary dreams.

958
01:31:57,060 --> 01:31:58,983
Let's take a look.

959
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:01,427
Nope. Nothing bad in there.

960
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:05,789
See? Maybe you could just try to be like her, hmm?

961
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:08,386
Ripley, she doesn't have bad dreams...

962
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:11,509
because she's just a piece of plastic.

963
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:15,107
Right. I'm sorry, Newt.

964
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:24,067
There.

965
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:27,030
My mommy always said there were no monsters...

966
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:30,422
no real ones... but there are.

967
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:33,748
Yes, there are, aren't there?

968
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:38,141
Why do they tell little kids that?

969
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:41,943
Most of the time it's true.

970
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:45,502
Did one of those things grow inside her?

971
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:48,390
I don't know, Newt.

972
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:50,428
That's the truth.

973
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:55,062
Isn't that how babies come? I mean, people babies?

974
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:58,747
- They grow inside you. - Oh, that's very different.

975
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:00,743
Did you ever have a baby?

976
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:04,142
Yes, I did. I had a little girl.

977
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:08,822
- Where is she? - She's gone.

978
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:12,588
You mean dead.

979
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:15,180
Here.

980
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:18,343
Take this.

981
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:21,828
For luck.

982
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:26,988
There's that.

983
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:31,063
Don't go, please.

984
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:34,701
Newt, I'm gonna be right in the next room.

985
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:36,703
And you see that camera right up there?

986
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:39,590
I can see you right through that camera,

987
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:42,027
all the time to see if you're safe.

988
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:49,065
I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.

989
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:53,065
I mean that. That's a promise.

990
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:55,825
You promise?

991
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:58,187
I cross my heart.

992
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:02,584
- And hope to die? - And hope to die.

993
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:21,909
Now go to sleep, and don't dream.

994
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:28,068
Sneak.

995
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:41,064
The molecular acid oxidizes after the creature's death, completely neutralizing it.

996
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:44,636
Bishop, you know, that's very interesting, but it doesn't really get us anywhere, does it?

997
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:47,186
I'm trying to figure out what we're dealing with here.

998
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:49,342
Let's go through it again.

999
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:51,667
They grab the colonists, they move them over there...

1000
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:56,064
and they immobilize them to be hosts for more of these.

1001
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:59,986
Which would mean that there would have to be a lot of these parasites, right?

1002
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:02,267
One for each colonist. That's over 100, at least.

1003
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:04,263
Yes. That follows.

1004
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:08,390
But each one of these things comes from an egg, right?

1005
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:12,863
So who's laying these eggs?

1006
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:16,023
I'm not sure.

1007
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:18,068
It must be something we haven't seen yet.

1008
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:20,347
Hey, maybe it's like an ant hive.

1009
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:22,468
Bees, man. Bees have hives.

1010
01:35:22,540 --> 01:35:27,706
You know what I mean. There's, like, one female that runs the whole show.

1011
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:30,187
- Yes, the queen. - Yeah, the mama.

1012
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:32,627
She's badass, man. I mean, big.

1013
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:35,311
- These things ain't ants, estúpido. - I know that.

1014
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:40,022
Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed as soon as you're finished with them.

1015
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:43,024
- Is that clear? - Mr. Burke gave instructions...

1016
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:46,940
that they were to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs.

1017
01:35:49,180 --> 01:35:51,148
He was very specific about it.

1018
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:56,545
Look, those two specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division, right?

1019
01:35:56,620 --> 01:36:00,022
Now, if you're smart, we can both come out of this heroes,

1020
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:03,309
and we will be set up for life.

1021
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:06,946
You're crazy, Burke. Do you know that?

1022
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:11,184
Do you really think you can get a dangerous organism like that past I.C.C. quarantine?

1023
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:14,150
How can they impound it if they don't know about it?

1024
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:17,303
But they will know about it, Burke, from me.

1025
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:21,590
Just like they'll know that you were responsible for the deaths of 157 colonists.

1026
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:24,146
- Wait a second. - You sent them to that ship.

1027
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:26,342
- You're wrong. - I just checked the colony log.

1028
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:30,311
Directive dated 6-12-79, signed Burke, Carter J.

1029
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:33,304
You sent them out there, and you didn't even warn them.

1030
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:35,866
- Why didn't you warn them, Burke? - Okay, look.

1031
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:38,476
What if that ship didn't even exist? Do you ever think about that?

1032
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:42,186
I didn't know. So now if I went and made a major security situation out of it,

1033
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:45,756
everybody steps in, administration steps in, and there's no exclusive rights for anybody.

1034
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:49,830
Nobody wins. So I made a decision, and it was wrong.

1035
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:52,631
It was a bad call, Ripley. It was a bad call.

1036
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:54,424
- Bad call? - Right.

1037
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,104
These people are dead, Burke!

1038
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:58,626
Don't you have any idea what you've done here?

1039
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:01,624
I'm gonna make sure that they nail you right to the wall for this!

1040
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:03,941
You're not gonna sleaze your way out of this one.

1041
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:06,227
Right to the wall.

1042
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:11,109
Ripley. I...

1043
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:13,182
You know, I expected more from you.

1044
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:16,230
I thought... you'd be smarter than this.

1045
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:19,668
Well, I'm happy to disappoint you.

1046
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:35,661
- What is it? What's going on? - They're coming.

1047
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:38,226
- Where? - In the tunnel.

1048
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:45,264
Here we go. "A" and "B" gun tracking far end. Multiple targets.

1049
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:52,903
Those ammo counters go.

1050
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:57,708
"B" gun's down 50%.

1051
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:01,141
Man, it's a shooting gallery down there.

1052
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:06,864
Sixty rounds left on "B."

1053
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:10,103
Forty. Twenty. Ten.

1054
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:12,421
"B" gun's dry. Twenty on "A."

1055
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:16,909
Ten. Five.

1056
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:21,464
That's it.

1057
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:24,783
Jesus, they were wall-to-wall in there.

1058
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:30,742
They're at the pressure door.

1059
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:34,308
Man, listen to that.

1060
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:38,066
Bishop here. I'm afraid I have some bad news.

1061
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:39,140
Well, that's a switch.

1062
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:45,030
It's very pretty, Bishop, but what are we looking for?

1063
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:48,661
That's it. Emergency venting.

1064
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:53,348
Oh, that's beautiful, man. Oh, man, that... that just beats it all.

1065
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:56,304
- How long till it blows? - Four hours.

1066
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:59,503
With a blast radius of 30 kilometers,

1067
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:03,187
equal to about 40 megatons.

1068
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:06,787
We got problems. HUDSON: I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.

1069
01:39:06,860 --> 01:39:09,386
Vasquez, close the shutters.

1070
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:11,622
Why can't we shut it down from here?

1071
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:13,623
I'm sorry. The crash caused too much damage.

1072
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:16,271
An overload... is inevitable at this point.

1073
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:19,264
Oh, man, and I was getting short.

1074
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:22,662
Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock.

1075
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:24,862
- It ain't half fair, man. - Hudson, give us a break!

1076
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:27,511
Four more weeks. Oh, man.

1077
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:30,823
We've got to get the other drop ship from the Sulaco.

1078
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:33,870
I mean, there must be some way of bringing it down on remote.

1079
01:39:33,940 --> 01:39:37,422
How? The transmitter was on the A.P.C. It's wasted.

1080
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:40,789
I don't care how, but we'd better think of something. We'd better think of a way.

1081
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:43,744
- Think of what? We're fucked! We're doomed! - Shut up!

1082
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:46,630
Shut up! What about the colony transmitters?

1083
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:49,510
The uplink tower down at the other end. Why can't we use that?

1084
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:52,550
No, I checked. The hardware in between here and there was damaged.

1085
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,543
We can't align the dish.

1086
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:57,066
Well, somebody's gonna have to go out there,

1087
01:39:57,140 --> 01:40:00,064
take a portable terminal, go out there and patch in manually.

1088
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:05,180
Oh, yeah, sure. With those things running around? You can count me out.

1089
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:07,379
- Yeah I guess we can just count you out of everything. - I'll go. I'll go.

1090
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:09,276
That's right, man. Why don't you go, man?

1091
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:11,143
- I'll go. - What?

1092
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:15,589
I'll go. I mean, I'm the only one qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway.

1093
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:20,029
Yeah, right, man. Bishop should go. Good idea.

1094
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:22,262
Believe me, I'd prefer not to.

1095
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:25,264
I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.

1096
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:38,949
How long?

1097
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:42,303
This conduit runs almost to the uplink assembly... 180 meters.

1098
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:45,708
- Say 40 minutes to crawl down there... - Right.

1099
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:49,546
An hour to, patch in and align the antenna.

1100
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:52,907
Thirty minutes to prep the ship,

1101
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:56,229
- and about 50 minutes flight time. - It's gonna be close.

1102
01:41:00,740 --> 01:41:03,471
- Good luck. - See you soon.

1103
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:08,700
Watch your fingers.

1104
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:13,065
Vaya con Dios, man.

1105
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:29,468
This is unbelievable. Twenty meters and closing.

1106
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:31,662
- Fifteen. - How many?

1107
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:34,351
Can't tell. Lots.

1108
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:39,183
"D" gun's down 50%.

1109
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:44,349
"C" gun's right behind it.

1110
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:49,509
Stopping them. It ain't stopping them.

1111
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:54,586
- 150 rounds on "D." - Come on. Come on, baby.

1112
01:41:54,660 --> 01:41:56,947
Hundred rounds.

1113
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:59,705
Come on! Come on!

1114
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:06,225
"D" gun's down to 20.

1115
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:09,906
10.

1116
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:12,551
Damn it!

1117
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:17,184
Wait! They're retreating.

1118
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:25,151
The guns stopped them.

1119
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:28,988
You're right.

1120
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:38,303
Next time they walk right up and knock.

1121
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:40,348
Yeah, but they don't know that.

1122
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:43,185
They're probably looking for other ways to get in.

1123
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:46,109
That'll take 'em a while.

1124
01:42:46,220 --> 01:42:48,700
- Maybe we got 'em demoralized. - Shut up!

1125
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:52,506
I want you two walking perimeter.

1126
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:56,671
Move!

1127
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:05,107
Hey, listen.

1128
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:08,104
We're all in strung-out shape,

1129
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:11,502
but stay frosty and alert.

1130
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:15,790
We can't afford to let one of those bastards in here.

1131
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:18,022
All right. Vámonos.

1132
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:30,942
How long's it been since you got any sleep?

1133
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:34,627
Twenty-four hours?

1134
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:38,022
Hicks, I'm not gonna end up like those others.

1135
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:40,944
You'll take care of it, won't you?

1136
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:47,062
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.

1137
01:43:48,780 --> 01:43:51,511
Listen, let's just make sure it doesn't come to that.

1138
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:55,181
- All right? - All right.

1139
01:43:55,300 --> 01:44:00,511
Hey, I want to introduce you to a personal friend of mine.

1140
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:04,505
This is an M-41 A pulse rifle, 10 millimeter,

1141
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:08,426
with an over-and-under 30 millimeter pump-action grenade launcher.

1142
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:10,468
Feel the weight.

1143
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:19,667
Okay, what do I do?

1144
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:27,751
- Okay, pull it in tight here. - Right.

1145
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:30,147
- Uh-huh. Lean into it. - Mm-hmm.

1146
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:32,905
All right. Now, it will kick some.

1147
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:36,541
All right. When the counter reads zero here, you...

1148
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:38,901
- I press this up? - That's right.

1149
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:44,143
Get another one in quick. Slap it in hard.

1150
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:47,264
- Right. - And you're ready to rock and roll.

1151
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:50,190
- What's this? - That's the grenade launcher...

1152
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:53,025
I don't think you want to mess with that.

1153
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:57,105
You started this. Show me everything.

1154
01:44:57,180 --> 01:44:59,148
I can handle myself.

1155
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:02,708
Yeah, I noticed.

1156
01:45:12,820 --> 01:45:14,788
How do you feel?

1157
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:18,387
All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover.

1158
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:22,107
- Look, Ripley, I just want... - Forget it.

1159
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:24,188
Excuse me.

1160
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:23,947
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay. It's okay.

1161
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:38,107
Newt, Newt, wake up.

1162
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:40,103
- Wha... - Be quiet.

1163
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:42,182
We're in trouble.

1164
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:01,509
No!

1165
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:04,231
Move, Newt!

1166
01:48:24,700 --> 01:48:26,623
Hey!

1167
01:48:35,660 --> 01:48:39,984
Help! Help!

1168
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:42,028
- Somebody! - Hicks!

1169
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:44,023
Say again, Bishop.

1170
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:47,468
You've got it into auto-refuel mode, and it's sequencing right?

1171
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:50,584
- That's right. - Okay, good. Stay on it.

1172
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:54,261
Get back to me when you've activated the launch cycle.

1173
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:57,583
- Roger. - He's at the uplink tower.

1174
01:48:57,700 --> 01:49:00,226
- Good. - Terrific.

1175
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:04,949
- Hicks! Hicks! Hicks! - Help!

1176
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:07,591
- Help! Help! - Hicks, help us!

1177
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:11,790
- Break the glass! Break it. Break it. - Yes.

1178
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:13,862
I'll try.

1179
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:36,580
Ripley, I'm scared.

1180
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:38,662
Me too.

1181
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:46,142
Stay here.

1182
01:49:57,940 --> 01:50:00,989
- It's the med lab. - Hudson!

1183
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:04,382
Vasquez, meet me in med lab. We got a fire.

1184
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:06,502
We're on our way.

1185
01:50:09,380 --> 01:50:11,382
They're coming, Newt.

1186
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:46,022
Shoot it out!

1187
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:51,909
- Hudson! - Jesus.

1188
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:57,821
Christ, kid, look out!

1189
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:06,741
Fucking die.

1190
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:21,863
- Over there! Ready? - Yeah! Yeah!

1191
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:23,590
Now!

1192
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:28,949
- Hudson? - Yeah. All clear.

1193
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:31,631
Nailed the other one. It's history, man.

1194
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:34,943
Jesus.

1195
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:39,707
- Burke... - It was Burke.

1196
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:45,183
I say we grease this rat-fuck son of a bitch right now.

1197
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:48,184
Just doesn't make any goddamn sense.

1198
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:55,190
He figured that he could get an alien back through quarantine...

1199
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:57,991
if one of us was impregnated...

1200
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:01,467
whatever you call it...

1201
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:04,146
and then frozen for the trip home.

1202
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:08,270
Nobody would know about the embryos we were carrying...

1203
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:10,388
me and Newt.

1204
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:14,188
Wait a minute, now. We'd all know.

1205
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:16,547
Yes. The only way he could do it...

1206
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:20,386
is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the way home.

1207
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:23,031
Namely yours.

1208
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:26,986
Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.

1209
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:32,470
Fuck! He's dead. You're dog meat, pal.

1210
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:35,383
This is so nuts.

1211
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:38,111
I mean, listen... Listen to what you're saying.

1212
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:40,865
It's paranoid delusion.

1213
01:52:40,940 --> 01:52:45,264
It's really sad. It's pathetic.

1214
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:49,140
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.

1215
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:52,542
You don't see them fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage.

1216
01:52:52,620 --> 01:52:55,749
All right. We waste him. No offense.

1217
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:57,504
No! He's gotta go back...

1218
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:02,311
- They cut the power. - What do you mean, they cut the power?

1219
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:03,996
How could they cut the power, man? They're animals.

1220
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:06,626
I want you two with trackers, checking the corridors! Move!

1221
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:08,623
- Gorman, watch Burke! - I got him.

1222
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:11,021
Newt, stay close.

1223
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:17,583
- I'll go this side. - You do that, man.

1224
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:44,105
- Anything? - There's something.

1225
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:47,429
It's inside the complex.

1226
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:49,502
You're just reading me.

1227
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:52,383
No, no, it ain't you.

1228
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:58,226
They're inside... inside the perimeter. They're in here.

1229
01:53:58,300 --> 01:54:01,782
Hudson, stay cool! Vasquez?

1230
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:10,104
Hudson may be right.

1231
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:13,349
- Get back, both of you! - The signal's weird.

1232
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:17,425
Must be some interference or something.

1233
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:19,423
There's movement all over the place!

1234
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:22,822
Get back to Operations. It's game time.

1235
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:25,301
Newt.

1236
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:29,710
Seal the door. Hurry!

1237
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:33,262
Come on! Come on! Come on! Get back!

1238
01:54:33,340 --> 01:54:35,263
Work fast.

1239
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:41,829
Cover your eyes, Newt. Don't look at the light.

1240
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:44,904
Movement. Signal's clean.

1241
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:46,903
Range, Twenty meters.

1242
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:49,142
They found a way in, something we missed.

1243
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:51,143
We didn't miss anything.

1244
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:55,020
Eighteen, Seventeen meters.

1245
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:57,501
Something under the floor, not in the plans. I don't know.

1246
01:54:57,580 --> 01:54:59,662
- Fifteen meters. - Ripley!

1247
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:03,222
- Definitely inside the barricades. - Let's go.

1248
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:06,836
- Thirteen meters. - That's right outside the door.

1249
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:09,511
- Hicks, Vasquez, get back! - Man, this is a big fucking signal.

1250
01:55:09,580 --> 01:55:12,789
- How you doing, Vasquez? Talk to me. - Almost there.

1251
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:16,787
That's it.

1252
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:21,184
Twelve meters. Eleven.

1253
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:23,740
- Ten. - Then they're right on us.

1254
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:27,103
- Nine meters. - Remember... short, controlled bursts.

1255
01:55:27,180 --> 01:55:28,511
Eight meters.

1256
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:34,185
Seven.

1257
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:37,184
- Six. - It can't be. That's inside the room.

1258
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:40,309
- It's reading right, man. Look! - Well, you're not reading it right.

1259
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:47,508
Five meters, man. Four. What the hell?

1260
01:55:50,180 --> 01:55:53,741
- Oh, my God. Oh, sh... - Give me the light.

1261
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:14,786
There they go! Over there! Get them!

1262
01:56:14,860 --> 01:56:19,582
Come on! Come on! Get 'em!

1263
01:56:19,660 --> 01:56:22,982
Do something, Gorman!

1264
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:26,781
- Get them! Look out! - There's more of them! There's more of them!

1265
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:30,990
Medical! Get to Medical! Do it! Now!

1266
01:56:31,060 --> 01:56:35,190
Hudson, look out! Look out!

1267
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:39,549
Now!

1268
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:43,782
Burke!

1269
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:46,744
Open this door!

1270
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:49,625
Burke! Open it!

1271
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:53,424
Come on let's go! Fall back!

1272
01:56:56,620 --> 01:56:58,827
Go!

1273
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:01,744
- Die, motherfucker! - Burke!

1274
01:57:01,820 --> 01:57:05,427
Hudson! Hudson!

1275
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:10,506
Motherfucker! Come on! Come on! Come and get it, baby! Come on!

1276
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:14,221
I don't got all day! Come on! Come on! Come on, you bastard!

1277
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:17,105
Come on! You too! Oh, you want some of this?

1278
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:19,467
Fuck you!

1279
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:23,185
Fuck you! Hicks! Hicks!

1280
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:25,911
Hudson!

1281
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:36,466
Come on. Let's go!

1282
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:39,307
It's locked!

1283
01:57:56,580 --> 01:58:00,301
- Got it! Let's go! Let's go! - Go! Go!

1284
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:05,790
- Move, Gorman! - Seal it!

1285
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:11,144
Burke! Goddamn you! Open this door!

1286
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:23,747
Get back!

1287
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:26,061
- Hurry up. - Gorman, get out of the way!

1288
01:58:26,180 --> 01:58:29,184
- Ripley, this way! - What...

1289
01:58:29,260 --> 01:58:31,149
Wait. Get behind me.

1290
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:35,350
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast!

1291
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:39,504
- Hicks! - Go! Come on. Let's go.

1292
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:42,670
Move!

1293
01:58:49,620 --> 01:58:53,147
- Which way is it to the landing field from here? - This way.

1294
01:58:57,740 --> 01:59:00,550
Go right.

1295
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:04,788
This way. This way.

1296
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:16,867
- Which way? - Straight ahead and left.

1297
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:20,547
Bishop, do you read me? Come in. Over.

1298
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:22,509
The ship is on its way.

1299
01:59:22,580 --> 01:59:25,663
E.T.A., 16 minutes.

1300
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:28,550
Stand by there. We're on our way.

1301
01:59:39,820 --> 01:59:41,788
- Which way now? - That way.

1302
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:44,909
- No, wait. This way. - You sure?

1303
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:49,344
Vasquez, move!

1304
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:54,102
- Right up here. It's just up here. - Hicks!

1305
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:57,070
We're almost there.

1306
01:59:57,140 --> 02:00:00,428
Newt, wait! Newt!

1307
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:26,388
Vasquez!

1308
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:28,781
Go!

1309
02:00:30,940 --> 02:00:33,466
Oh, no!

1310
02:00:44,700 --> 02:00:47,067
Newt.

1311
02:00:47,140 --> 02:00:50,462
Up there. There's a shortcut across the roof.

1312
02:00:50,540 --> 02:00:52,622
Hicks.

1313
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:04,188
You always were an asshole, Gorman.

1314
02:01:22,580 --> 02:01:24,787
- Newt! God! - Ripley!

1315
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:27,147
Newt!

1316
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:30,349
Hicks! Hicks, get her! Hurry!

1317
02:01:34,780 --> 02:01:37,260
- Hold on, Newt! - I'm slipping!

1318
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:39,547
- Don't let go. - Ripley!

1319
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:42,669
- Hold on. Gotcha! - Help!

1320
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:46,146
I gotcha.

1321
02:01:46,220 --> 02:01:49,110
Newt!

1322
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:51,063
No!

1323
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:57,270
Come on. We can find her with this.

1324
02:01:57,380 --> 02:02:01,066
- Stay where you are, Newt. - Ripley!

1325
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:04,269
We're coming.

1326
02:02:13,460 --> 02:02:15,462
Ripley!

1327
02:02:17,940 --> 02:02:21,626
This way.

1328
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:26,542
- She's close. - Newt!

1329
02:02:29,220 --> 02:02:31,143
Ripley!

1330
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:33,700
Where are you? Can you hear me?

1331
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:36,983
- Newt! - Here!

1332
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:39,267
- I'm here! - Where?

1333
02:02:43,340 --> 02:02:46,389
Newt, are you okay?

1334
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:49,270
We'll have to cut it.

1335
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:52,742
Climb down, honey. We've gotta cut through.

1336
02:02:59,980 --> 02:03:01,903
Newt?

1337
02:03:01,980 --> 02:03:05,268
Now, don't move. Stay very still.

1338
02:03:05,340 --> 02:03:07,342
Okay.

1339
02:03:07,420 --> 02:03:10,105
We're almost there. Hang in there, okay?

1340
02:03:17,260 --> 02:03:19,024
- Hicks. Hurry. - I know.

1341
02:03:19,140 --> 02:03:21,620
- I know! - I mean it!

1342
02:03:35,260 --> 02:03:38,184
Newt? Newt, just stay still.

1343
02:03:41,380 --> 02:03:43,587
Almost there.

1344
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:45,344
No!

1345
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:48,902
Newt!

1346
02:03:58,700 --> 02:04:02,182
No! No!

1347
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:04,462
- Let's go. - No!

1348
02:04:04,540 --> 02:04:06,747
No! No! They don't kill you!

1349
02:04:06,820 --> 02:04:08,948
They... They don't kill you! They...

1350
02:04:09,020 --> 02:04:10,909
She's alive! She's alive!

1351
02:04:10,980 --> 02:04:13,426
All right. I believe you. She's alive.

1352
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:16,185
We've got to go. Now!

1353
02:04:31,060 --> 02:04:33,028
Go!

1354
02:04:46,580 --> 02:04:51,063
- Hicks. - Get it off!

1355
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:53,461
Get it off!

1356
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:03,546
Here.

1357
02:05:07,820 --> 02:05:09,902
Go.

1358
02:05:12,260 --> 02:05:14,467
Come on. You can make it.

1359
02:05:37,740 --> 02:05:41,028
Bishop, how much time?

1360
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:42,864
Plenty. Twenty-six minutes.

1361
02:05:43,020 --> 02:05:46,388
- We're not leaving. - We're not?

1362
02:07:10,700 --> 02:07:15,103
- Ripley... - I don't wanna hear about it, Bishop. She's alive. There's still time.

1363
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:18,309
In 19 minutes, this area is gonna be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.

1364
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:21,230
- Hicks, don't let him leave. - We ain't going anywhere.

1365
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:26,749
- See you, Hicks. - Dwayne.

1366
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:29,630
It's Dwayne.

1367
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:33,303
Ellen.

1368
02:07:33,380 --> 02:07:37,021
Don't be gone long, Ellen.

1369
02:07:44,140 --> 02:07:47,223
Attention. Emergency.

1370
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:51,350
All personnel must evacuate immediately.

1371
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:54,264
You now have 15 minutes...

1372
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:56,627
to reach minimum safe distance.

1373
02:08:42,940 --> 02:08:46,387
Attention. Emergency.

1374
02:08:46,460 --> 02:08:50,704
All personnel must evacuate immediately.

1375
02:08:50,780 --> 02:08:53,545
You now have 14 minutes...

1376
02:08:53,620 --> 02:08:56,271
to reach minimum safe distance.

1377
02:11:46,820 --> 02:11:51,144
Oh.

1378
02:12:36,740 --> 02:12:40,426
- Ripley! Ripley! - Newt.

1379
02:12:54,340 --> 02:12:58,629
Grab on to me! Hold on!

1380
02:16:49,580 --> 02:16:51,582
Let's go!

1381
02:16:54,540 --> 02:16:57,020
Behind us!

1382
02:17:47,820 --> 02:17:50,664
Attention. Emergency.

1383
02:17:50,740 --> 02:17:53,903
All personnel must evacuate immediately.

1384
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:58,669
Attention. Emergency.

1385
02:17:58,740 --> 02:18:03,268
All personnel must evacuate immediately.

1386
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:05,786
You now have four minutes...

1387
02:18:05,860 --> 02:18:08,340
to reach minimum safe distance.

1388
02:18:24,300 --> 02:18:28,100
Come on, goddamn it!

1389
02:18:31,060 --> 02:18:33,870
Hold on to me!

1390
02:19:23,100 --> 02:19:25,910
Attention. Emergency.

1391
02:19:25,980 --> 02:19:29,905
All personnel must evacuate immediately.

1392
02:19:29,980 --> 02:19:32,665
You now have two minutes...

1393
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:36,745
to reach minimum safe distance.

1394
02:19:42,460 --> 02:19:44,462
No.

1395
02:19:47,780 --> 02:19:50,670
Bishop, goddamn you!

1396
02:20:54,460 --> 02:20:56,542
Close your eyes, baby.

1397
02:20:59,100 --> 02:21:01,102
Look!

1398
02:21:07,980 --> 02:21:09,982
Come on! Come on!

1399
02:21:38,460 --> 02:21:41,066
Punch it, Bishop!

1400
02:22:26,260 --> 02:22:28,342
It's okay. We're okay.

1401
02:22:38,060 --> 02:22:40,028
Hey.

1402
02:22:41,420 --> 02:22:43,946
We made it.

1403
02:22:44,020 --> 02:22:46,022
I knew you'd come.

1404
02:23:00,940 --> 02:23:03,147
He's gonna be all right. He's just out.

1405
02:23:03,220 --> 02:23:05,587
I had to give him another shot for the pain.

1406
02:23:06,780 --> 02:23:09,386
We need a stretcher to carry him up to Medical.

1407
02:23:09,460 --> 02:23:11,462
Okay.

1408
02:23:17,140 --> 02:23:21,145
I'm sorry if I scared you. That platform was just becoming too unstable.

1409
02:23:21,220 --> 02:23:24,076
I had to circle and hope that things didn't get too rough to take you off.

1410
02:23:24,100 --> 02:23:28,071
Bishop, you did okay.

1411
02:23:28,140 --> 02:23:30,871
- I did? - Oh, yeah.

1412
02:24:10,300 --> 02:24:12,541
Go! Move!

1413
02:24:14,940 --> 02:24:18,103
No! Here! Here!

1414
02:24:18,220 --> 02:24:20,222
Run!

1415
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:27,104
Here!

1416
02:25:55,820 --> 02:25:58,061
Get away from her, you bitch!

1417
02:26:19,180 --> 02:26:23,742
Come on! Come on!

1418
02:27:52,220 --> 02:27:54,666
Ripley!

1419
02:29:06,060 --> 02:29:08,540
Bishop!

1420
02:29:55,060 --> 02:29:58,064
- Mommy. - Oh, God!

1421
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:04,149
Not bad for a h-human.

1422
02:30:51,260 --> 02:30:54,230
Are we gonna sleep all the way home?

1423
02:30:54,340 --> 02:30:57,344
- All the way home. - Can I dream?

1424
02:30:59,660 --> 02:31:02,266
Yes, honey. I think we both can.

1425
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:13,629
- Sleep tight. - Affirmative.
