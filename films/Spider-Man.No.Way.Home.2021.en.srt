<i>You may find this video disturbing.</i>

5

<i>Spider-Man attacked me.</i>

8
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:24,317
<i>He has an army of drones,
Stark technology.</i>

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,070
<i>He's saying he's the only one who's
gonna be the new Iron Man. No one else.</i>

10
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:30,406
<i>Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?</i>

11
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,366
<i>There will be significant casualties.</i>

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,327

Yo, it's him.

31
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:33,427
- Please don't touch her, sir.
- You're just a kid?

32
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,137
You murdered Mysterio?

33
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:36,639
- You helped him?
- No, I didn't--

34
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,808
Come on, kid, let me see your face.

35
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,643
- He hit me. Spider-Man hit me.
- Come on.

36
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:41,560
He hit me.

37
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:45,147

39

I told you
I never wanted to do this ever again!

40
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,991
MJ, I'm so sorry, but I can't see anything
with your hand in my--

41
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,617
Sorry. Where are we gonna go?

42
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,494
- I don't know. Your house?
- No!

43
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,121
My dad will kill you.

44
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,998
What? You said your dad really liked me.

45
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,833
Yeah, well, not anymore.

46
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,378
- Dude.
- <i>Dude.</i>

47
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,713
- Dude.
- <i>Dude.</i>

48
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:09,797
Dude!

- Dude!

00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,885
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

51
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,929
- No, not really.
- Yo, Peter!

52
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,064
We should go. We should go. Come on.

53
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,275
- You said you don't want to swing.
- You should just swing me.

54
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:30,901
- Okay. We can take the subway.
- Okay.

55
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:35,865
No.

56
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:42,955
Look out!

57
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:54,342
That was so much worse. Okay. It's okay.

58
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,677
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,847
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, I'm so sorry.

60
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,983
Okay.

61
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:12,443
Okay.

62
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,111
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,949
I just feel so dumb.
I didn't realize you were miserable.

64
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:22,411
No, it was really fun, right?
That's why they call it a fling.

65
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:26,123
- And we flung.
- It was fun. I could've been more fun.

66
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,626
- We'll hang out again.
- Like, when do you think?

67
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,173
- I should see what that is.
- No, no, no.

68
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,926
- It's what I do. Peter?
- He's always coming and going.

69
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:37,927
- Peter?
- Oh, no.

70
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,886
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no.

71
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,638
- Peter? Peter?
- I don't know what to do.

72
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,434
- I didn't see anything.
- This isn't what it looks like.

73
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:47,228
- No, no, no, May.
- Practice safe--

74
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:50,064
Oh, hey. You must be MJ.

75
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,817
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

76
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,569
- Wait, have you been crying?
- We broke up.

77
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:58,823
Hey, Spider-Man!

78
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,159
Thank you. I didn't know you broke up.

79
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:05,204
I thought you were in love, May.
Can we talk about this in the kitchen?

80
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,831
I should probably leave.

81
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,874
I thought you guys were
such a handsome couple.

82
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,043
It's really about boundaries.

83
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,462
- Let me answer the door.
- Let's go in here.

84
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:15,047
- Is that the door?
- Hey. Is it true?

85
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:17,049
- I was gonna go, but...
- Not now.

86
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:20,094
I didn't know you were
so awkward about sex, Peter.

87
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,096
This has nothing to do with sex.

88
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:25,057
If you wanna go over it again.
I mean-- What's that sound?

89
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,894
- Hey, Spider-Man!
- Oh, my God.

90
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,440
I mean, I'm happy to rehash it
if you want to.

91
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,192
You take care of your side,
I'll take care of mine.

92
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,029
What is up with this phone?

93
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,031
Will you get off your phones
for five minutes?

94
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,409
I just wanna talk to you
about your relationship, okay?

95
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,326
Peter?

96
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,372
What?

97
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,750
- Is that--?
- Is that here?

98
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,143
- Yo, Peter Parker!
- Yo, Peter!

99
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,187
Maybe it's not such a big deal.

<i>that the deadly drones used
in the London attack</i>

111
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,640
<i>were designed by Stark Industries.</i>

112
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:49,642
Federal agents! Open up!

113
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,519
Federal agents? You stay here.

114
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,812
Department of Damage Control.

115
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,731
We have a warrant
for the arrest of Peter Parker.

116
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,399
- You know the Fourth Amendment?
- Sure.

117
00:05:57,483 --> 00:06:00,236
- Unreasonable search and seizure?
- Get in here, guys. Let's go.

118
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,864
I didn't kill Quentin Beck.
The drones did, okay?

119
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:05,783
- The drones that are yours.
- No.

120
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,160
Nick Fury was there the entire time.

121
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:09,954
He can explain everything.

122
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,831
Nick Fury has been off-planet
for the last year.

123
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,792
- What?
- Peter! Hey.

124
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:18,003
MJ! They have nothing
to do with this, sir.

125
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,172
Don't say anything without a lawyer.

126
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:21,799
I want a lawyer.

127
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,843
- Ms. Jones-Watson.
- Jones. I don't go by Watson.

128
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:29,181
- Ms. Jones, why do you want a lawyer if--?
- If I have nothing to hide?

129
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:32,351
- Exactly. Unless--
- I'm actually guilty of something?

130
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,687
I'm very aware of your tactics
and my rights.

131
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,231
Just answer my questions.

132
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,024
I've seen your file.

133
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:42,027
You're a smart young woman
with a bright future ahead of her.

134
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:43,862
Why would you risk it all

135
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:47,324
by getting involved
with a vigilante like Peter Parker?

136
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,536
So sorry to keep you waiting.

137
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,162
- Can we get Ned a snack?
- Absolutely.

138
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,539
- He's been waiting.
- I got you.

139
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,249
Dude, I'm so sorry about that.

140
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,627
- I'm not supposed to say anything to you.
- Not even a thing.

141
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:02,590
I just have one question.
When MJ told you Peter was Spider-Man--

142
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,968
- What's up?
- I knew way before MJ did.

143
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,554
- I was Spider-Man's "guy in the chair."
- I know about those.

144
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,889
- Dude, half my guys are guys in the chair.
- Exactly.

145
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:14,351
You would know.
I literally helped him find the Vulture.

146
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,687
- I didn't know that.
- I helped him hack a suit once

147
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,230
and helped him get to space.

148
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:22,443
So in Spider-Man's illegal vigilantism,
you were his main accomplice.

149
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:28,490
I would like to have
my words stricken from the record.

150
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:32,119
With all due respect,
and I mean that very insincerely,

151
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,289
unless you have
some real specific charges to throw at us,

152
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,833
legally, you can't hold us here.

153
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,544
- You should definitely lawyer up.
- Excuse me?

154
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,755
Child endangerment's a nasty rap.

155
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,590
A boy was entrusted to you,

156
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,051
and as his legal guardian,
essentially his mother,

157
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:51,096
you not only allowed him
to endanger himself, you encouraged it.

158
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,848
Who does that?

159
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,933
I wanna see Peter right now.

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,540
I have some good news, Peter.

169
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,251
I don't believe any of the charges
against you are gonna stick.

170
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,586
Wait, seriously?

171
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,712
- I knew it.
- Nice.

172
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:25,381
Mr. Murdock, thank you.

173
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,132
- Thank you.
- That's amazing.

174
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,300
- You're welcome.
- Perfect.

175
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:30,469
- However, Mr. Hogan...
- Yes?

176
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,764
...the feds are investigating
that missing technology.

177
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,183
I understand your loyalty
to Mr. Stark and his legacy,

178
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,643
but if you were involved--

179
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,478
- If I was?
- I advise securing a lawyer.

180
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,606
I need a lawyer because I'm--?
I thought he was--

181
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,859
You said there's no charge.
I could say under advisement of counsel,

182
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,986
I refuse to answer
the question respectfully

183
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,030
because the answer can incriminate me--

184
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,616
It's in <i>Goodfellas.</i> What's the thing
they say in <i>Goodfellas?</i>

185
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,953
I know that's what you think. Calm down.
Let's hear what he has to say. Matt?

186
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,871
You're gonna need a really good lawyer.

187
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,376
You may have dodged your legal troubles,
but things will get much worse.

188
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,336
There is still the court
of public opinion.

189
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,341
Murderer! Mysterio forever!

190
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,303
How did you just do that?

191
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,723
I'm a really good lawyer.

192
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,685
We'll need a safer place to live.

193
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:33,991
How do we--? How do we--?

194
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,868
<i>Alarm system deactivated.</i>

195
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:41,290
It looks nice. And this is safe.

196
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,421
Welcome to the spiritual oasis.

197
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,590
You like <i>Donkey Kong Jr. ?</i>

198
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,927
<i>Nicky, from Jersey City,
you're on the line.</i>

199
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,680
<i>Hi. I'm not saying
I don't want to honor the Avengers,</i>

200
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:59,141
<i>but, you know, not doing it this way.</i>

201
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,478
<i>Putting the Captain America shield
on the Statue of Liberty?</i>

202
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,396
<i>Nah, that will look ridiculous.</i>

203
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,523
<i>Leave the Statue of Liberty alone.</i>

204
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,650
Oh, Happy.

205
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:12,404
- <i>Did you send in your applications yet?</i>
- I finished my MIT one.

206
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:13,489
- <i>You?</i>
- Same.

207
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,365
Can you imagine
if we both got in? And Ned?

208
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:19,328
Yeah, but we'd have to get scholarships,
so we could actually go.

209
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,705
You got the scores and the grades.

210
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,248
You think I'm being too pragmatic.

211
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,750
No, no, no. Well...

212
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,587
Kind of. It's okay.
It's one of my favorite things about you.

213
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,963
- Really?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

214
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,882
What are your other favorite things?

215
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,886
- Your relentless optimism.
- I'm a glass-half-full kind of gal.

216
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,597
- I really like how you're a people person.
- I love people.

217
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,141
- I love them so much.
- You like sports.

218
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,393
I think the Mets are gonna go
all the way this year.

219
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,562
- Really?
- What's that noise?

220
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,649
<i>It's-- It's Happy. Look.</i>

221
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,568
<i>Gave his room to May,
so he's sleeping down here.</i>

222
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,157
I have a weird question.

223
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,411
Does any part of you
feel relieved about this?

224
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,125
Ever since I got bit by that spider...

225
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,297
I've only had one week
where my life has felt normal.

226
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,842
Or kind of normal, I guess.

227
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,260
And...

228
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,263
that was when you found out.

229
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:23,976
<i>Because then everyone that was in my life
that I wanted to know knew.</i>

230
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,102
<i>And it was perfect.</i>

231
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,271
But now everybody knows and...

232
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:32,484
I am the most famous person
in the entire world.

233
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,153
And I'm still broke.

234
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,075
I'm...

235
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,078
excited to see you tomorrow.

236
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,456
Yeah. Me too.

237
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,791
Wrap it up.

238
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,960
You both like each other.
We get it. Hang up.

239
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,546
There's no new ground being broken.
I need my eight hours.

240
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,132
- Have you been listening this whole time?
- <i>Hi, Happy.</i>

241
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,216
Not by choice.

242
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,510
- MJ says hi.
- Hello.

243
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:00,888
We're covering
the first day of senior year

244
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,348
for Midtown High's most famous student,

245
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,808
Peter Parker.

246
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:08,437
Go get them, tiger!
Or should I say "spider"?

247
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,982
<i>The crowd has continued
to grow here all morning long</i>

248
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,067
<i>at the Midtown School of Science...</i>

249
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:18,113
<i>The crowd seems evenly divided
between supporters of Spider-Man</i>

250
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,197
<i>and protestors.</i>

251
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:20,991
MJ!

252
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,327
MJ! MJ! We love you!

253
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,829
MJ, are you gonna have his spider-babies?

254
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,998
Back up. Back up. Back up!

255
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,209
MJ, you know he's a murderer, right?

256
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,920
Peter, do a TikTok with me.

257
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,047
Mysterio forever!

258
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,173
Do a flip!

259
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,842
- Hey, let's see you and MJ kiss!
- Back off.

260
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,093
Who are you?

261
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,846
- Ned Leeds. Spider-Man's best friend.
- I'm Peter Parker's best friend.

262
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,515
You come at my boy,
you come at Flash Thompson.

263
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,643
If you wanna read
about our inspiring friendship,

264
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,811
you can in my new book, <i>Flashpoint.</i>

265
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:52,606
One spider, two hearts,
a million crazy-ass memories.

266
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,941
Check it out.

267
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:58,153
- Go.
- No, I gotta wait--

268
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,572
- No. Go.
- I'll see you inside, okay?

269
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,451
<i>Keep watching</i> Midtown News <i>all year</i>

273
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,505
Peter,

274
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:20,968
we would love to welcome you
back to Midtown High,

275
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,761
where we shape heroes.

276
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,638
Or murderers.

277
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:25,722
Stop it.

278
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,476
- It's an honor to serve you, sir.
- It's not.

279
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,894
Mysterio was right.

280
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,688
- Stop. That's all.
- Mysterio was right.

281
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,399
Some students put this together for you.

282
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,276
- No, you did that.
- I helped a little bit.

283
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,279
And I tried to stop you so many times,
but you powered through.

284
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,781
- He did all of that.
- Did a great job.

285
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,325
I hope you have time to check it out.

286
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,120
Feel free to walk
or swing through the hallway.

287
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,455
Or crawl on the ceiling
to avoid everybody.

288
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,958
- We all know you can do it.
- I'm just gonna...

289
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,460
- I know what you did.
- Stop. You're embarrassing yourself.

290
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,170
He's a conspiracy theorist.

291
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:13,145
Can we just stay up here all day?

292
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,939
- It is so crazy down there.
- This one's good.

293
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:19,109
"Some suggest that Parker's powers
include the male spider's ability

294
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,819
to hypnotize females,

295
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:25,282
which he used to seduce Jones-Watson
into his cult of personality."

296
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,075
Stop. Stop.

297
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,827
Yes, my Spider-Lord.

298
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,962
Finally, some privacy.

299
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,756
It is so crazy down there.

300
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,216
So I was thinking...

301
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,220
when we get into MIT,
we should live together.

302
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,264
- Yeah, for sure.
- Yeah, I'd love that.

303
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,853
- This is gonna be us.
- Yes. Minus the Frisbee and the smiling.

304
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,605
MIT's obviously the dream,

305
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:01,068
but if we match up our backup schools,
then either way, we'll be in Boston.

306
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,153
New school, new town.
I can Spider-Man there.

307
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,405
- They have crime in Boston, right?
- Yes.

308
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,033
- Wicked crime.
- It'll be like a fresh start.

309
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,078
What's up?

310
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,789
I don't know.
I just feel like, if you don't--

311
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,374
If you expect disappointment,

312
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,960
then you can never really
get disappointed.

313
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,170
Come on.

314
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:24,549
Be a fresh start.
And we'll all be together.

315
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,428
Yeah. No, you're right. Fresh start.

316
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:29,346
Yeah.

317
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,391
Fresh start.

318
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,312
First one's here!

319
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,652
It's okay. It's a backup.

320
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:45,946
Peter.

321
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,116
No?

322
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,786
Last one.

323
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:55,622
MIT?

324
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,211
Okay.

325
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:13,640
Okay.

326
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,476
- Ready?
- Jones,

327
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,187
I told you to take down
the Halloween decorations.

328
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:22,482
- Actually, that was Sasha, so--
- Enough attitude. Just do it.

329
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:24,651
On it.

330
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,487
Feel like I'm gonna puke.

331
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,198
Don't because he will
just make me clean it.

332
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:32,868
This is our only shot.
It's here or nowhere.

333
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,036
- Hey. Come on.
- Okay. You ready?

334
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,080
- Yeah.
- Okay, on three.

335
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,542
One, two, three.

336
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,066
No.

337
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,194
No. You?

338
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,363
"In light of recent controversy,

we are unable to consider
your application at this time."

340
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,870
This is so not fair.

341
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,915
I mean, this is so not fair.
I didn't do anything wrong.

342
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,083
You guys definitely didn't do
anything wrong.

343
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,712
Expect disappointment
and you will never get disappointed.

00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,678
<i>Boston</i>

346
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,018
You didn't get in?

347
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,604
Yeah, because we're actually friends
with Spider-Man.

348
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,150
Yeah. I better get going.

349
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:50,278
There's a mixer for new admissions and--

350
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:51,571
Sorry, guys.

351
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,199
Jones, what are you doing?
Get back to work.

352
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,283
Yeah, I'm coming.

353
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:56,826
Know what?

354
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,372
I wouldn't change a thing I did.

355
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,624
Me neither.

356
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,755
Although I do need
to show this letter to my parents.

358
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,410
Hi.

359
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,456
Hi?

360
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:26,541
I'm--

361
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,211
The most famous person
in the world. I know.

362
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:35,425
Wong. Try not to slip.
We don't have liability insurance.

363
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,139
- Is all this for a holiday party?
- No.

364
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,309
One of the rotunda gateways
connects to Siberia.

365
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,019
A blizzard blasted through.

366
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,774
Because someone forgot
to cast a monthly maintenance spell

367
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,275
to keep the seals tight.

368
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,487
That's right, he did, because he forgot
I now have higher duties.

369
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,696
Higher duties?

370
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,990
The Sorcerer Supreme has higher duties.

371
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,242
Wait, I thought
you were the Sorcerer Supreme.

372
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:04,829
No, he got it on a technicality
'cause I blipped for five years.

373
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,624
- Congratulations.
- If I'd been here, then--

374
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,917
You'd burn the place down.

375
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,336
You two, no one said stop shoveling.

376
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,005
So, Peter, to what do I owe the pleasure?

377
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,759
Right. I'm really sorry
to bother you, sir.

378
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,803
Please. We saved half
the universe together.

379
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:23,515
- Think we're beyond you calling me "sir."
- Okay, Stephen.

380
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:25,183
That feels weird, but I'll allow it.

381
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:28,895
When...

382
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,940
When Mysterio revealed my identity,

383
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,653
my entire life got screwed up
and I was wondering--

384
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,656
I don't know if this would actually work,
but I was wondering if...

385
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:44,661
maybe you could go back in time
and make it so he never did?

386
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:50,125
Peter, we tampered
with the stability of space-time

387
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,001
to resurrect countless lives.

388
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,337
You wanna do it again now
just 'cause yours got messy?

389
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,797
It's not about me.

390
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,966
This is really hurting a lot of people.

391
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,052
My Aunt May, Happy,

392
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,554
my best friend, my girlfriend,

393
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,556
their futures are ruined
just because they know me,

394
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,724
and they've done nothing wrong.

395
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,810
I am so sorry...

396
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,229
but even if I wanted to...

397
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,482
I don't have the Time Stone anymore.

398
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:17,819
That's right.

399
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:25,160
I'm really sorry if I wasted your time.

400
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,287
- You didn't.
- Just forget about it.

401
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,206
Oh, he will. He's very good
at forgetting things.

402
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,711
Wong, you've actually generated
a good idea.

403
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:35,795
What?

404
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,964
The Runes of Kof-Kol.

405
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,632
The Runes of Kof-Kol?

406
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,051
It's just a standard spell of forgetting.

407
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:45,096
Won't turn back time, but people will
forget you were ever Spider-Man.

408
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,098
- Seriously?
- No, not seriously.

409
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:50,768
That spell travels the dark borders
between known and unknown reality.

410
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:52,061
It's too dangerous.

411
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,772
We've used it for a lot less.

412
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,983
Do you remember
the full moon party at Kamar-Taj?

413
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,610
- No.
- Exactly.

414
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,615
Come on, Wong.

415
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,910
Hasn't he been through enough?

416
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,585
Just leave me out of this.

417
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,295
Fine.

418
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:19,547
Fine.

419
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,144
So, what is this place?

420
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:38,024
The Sanctum's built at the intersection
of cosmic energy currents.

421
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,734
We weren't the first to seek them out.

422
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,862
Some of these walls
are thousands of years old.

423
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:47,492
And they shot an episode
of <i>The Equalizer</i> here in the '80s.

424
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:48,409
Well, I...

425
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,330
really appreciate you
doing this for me, sir.

426
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,249
Don't mention it.

427
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,627
And don't call me "sir."

428
00:22:58,753 --> 00:22:59,629
Right. Sorry.

429
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:01,631
You ready?

430
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:03,508
I'm ready.

431
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,220
Nice knowing you, Spider-Man.

432
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:12,850
Wait, excuse me?

433
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:18,147
The entire world's about to forget
that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

434
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,525
- Including me.
- Everyone?

435
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,988
- Can't some people still know?
- That's not how the spell works.

436
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:28,950
And it's very difficult and dangerous
to change it mid-casting.

437
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,160
So my girlfriend's gonna
forget everything?

438
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,745
Is she even gonna be my girlfriend?

439
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,206
Was she your girlfriend
just 'cause you were Spider-Man?

440
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,750
- I don't know. I really hope not.
- All right, fine.

441
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:43,298
Everyone's gonna forget
you're Spider-Man except your girlfriend.

442
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,507
Thank you so much.

443
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,135
Oh, my God, Ned. Ned.

444
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,138
What is a Ned?

445
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:53,057
He's my best friend,
so it's important to me that Ned knows.

446
00:23:57,395 --> 00:24:01,941
Okay, let's not change
the parameters of this spell any more

447
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,818
- while I'm casting it.
- Okay, I'm done.

448
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,111
I swear, I'm done. I'm done.

449
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:08,865
- But my Aunt May should really know.
- Peter, stop tampering with the spell.

450
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,367
When she found out I was Spider-Man,
it was really messy.

451
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,661
I don't think
I could go through that again.

452
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,331
- So my Aunt May?
- Yes.

453
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:17,707
Thank you. Happy?

454
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,000
No, I'm annoyed.

455
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,044
No, it's a nickname. Harold "Happy" Hogan.

456
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,254
He used to work with Tony Stark,
but then he was...

457
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,006
Would you just stop talking?

458
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:37,435
Basically, everyone that knew
I was Spider-Man before should still know!

459
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,207
- Did it work?
- No.

460
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,377
You changed my spell six times.

461
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,087
- Five times.
- You changed my spell.

462
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,507
You don't do that.
I told you. And that is why.

463
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,259
That spell was out of control.
If I hadn't shut it down,

464
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,679
something catastrophic
could have happened.

465
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:15,390
- Stephen, listen, I am so--
- Call me "sir."

466
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,143
Sorry, sir.

467
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:25,566
After everything we've been through,
somehow I always forget you're just a kid.

468
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,654
Look, Parker, the problem is not Mysterio.

469
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,989
It's you trying
to live two different lives.

470
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:34,534
And the longer you do that,
the more dangerous it becomes.

471
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:35,827
Believe me.

472
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,747
I'm so sorry about you
and your friends not getting into college,

473
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:44,460
but if they rejected you and you tried
to convince them to reconsider,

474
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,713
there's nothing else you can do.

475
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,801
When you say "convince them,"

476
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,512
- you mean, I could have called them?
- Yeah.

477
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,139
I could do that?

478
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59,559
You haven't called the...?

479
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,394
I got their letter. I assumed that was--

480
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,603
I'm sorry.

481
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,439
Are you telling me

482
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:07,775
that you didn't even think
to plead your case with them first

483
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:11,612
before you asked me
to brainwash the entire world?

484
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,284
When you put it like that...

485
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,710
Come on, pick up, pick up.

486
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,170
Dude, what? I'm busy.

487
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,505
- Flash, where's the MIT mixer?
- <i>Why?</i>

488
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,090
Because I need to talk to someone.

489
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,092
I'm trying to get Ned and MJ
a second chance at getting in.

490
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:34,385
What's in it for me?

491
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:36,179
<i>I'm risking a lot just talking to you.</i>

492
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,722
Okay, I will...

493
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,976
pick you up and swing you
to school for one week?

494
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:42,894
For a month.

495
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,188
- <i>For a week.</i>
- Two weeks.

496
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,523
- Flash, please. Help me.
- You know what I want.

497
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,611
Okay, I'll tell everyone
you're my best friend.

498
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,654
- <i>Flash, please, help me.</i>
- Cool.

499
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:56,741
<i>There's the assistant vice chancellor.
You can plead your case with her.</i>

500
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,534
- Okay, perfect. Where is she?
- She left.

501
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:00,369
- To go where?
- To the airport.

502
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,920
<i>Stark network unavailable.</i>

<i>Facial recognition unavailable.</i>

504
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,302
Hi.

505
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,139
Yeah, I can see you.

506
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:31,359
Oh, my God!

507
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,321
- That's Peter Parker.
- Mom.

508
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,989
- Mom, look.
- Mommy.

509
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,658
No, it's Peter Parker.

510
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,168
Hey!

511
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:50,753
Okay.

512
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:02,765
Yeah.

513
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,725
Hi. I'm Peter Parker.

514
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:07,353
- You do know you're in the street, right?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

515
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,606
I really needed to talk to you and I know
you're on your way to the airport.

516
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,235
MJ Watson and Ned Leeds are
the two smartest people I've ever met,

517
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,696
and I'm the dumbest person
because I let them help me,

518
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,698
but if I didn't, millions would've died,

519
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,908
so please don't let MIT be dumb like me.

520
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:21,993
MIT is dumb?

521
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:24,996
No, I'm saying, don't let MIT be dumb.

522
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:29,625
I mean, like the dumber version of me
that wouldn't have let them help.

523
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,754
You didn't rehearse that, did you, Peter?

524
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,173
Basically, what I'm trying to--

525
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,474
Why are you running?

526
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:50,563
Oh, my God.

527
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,190
Ma'am, you should get out of the car.

528
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,443
Everybody get off the bridge!

529
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,446
The door's locked.

530
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,197
Door's-- Hey!

531
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,382
Hello, Peter.

532
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,427
Hi? Do we--? Do I know you?

533
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,763
What have you done with my machine?

534
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,682
I don't know what you're talking about.
What machine?

535
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:29,602
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

536
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:31,103
It's gone.

537
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,272
Listen, if you stop smashing cars,

538
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,983
we can work together
and I can help you find your machine.

539
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,568
You want to play games?

540
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,530
Catch!

541
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,841
It's okay. You guys are good.
You're safe. Get out of here.

542
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:03,636
You think
your fancy new suit's gonna save you?

543
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:21,487
Should've killed your little girlfriend
when I had the chance.

544
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,867
What did you just say?

545
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:29,120
Looks like we got competition.

546
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,224
Peter!

547
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,350
Help!

548
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:15,666
Don't worry, ma'am! I'm coming!

549
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,753
Peter!

550
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,156
Ma'am, just stay calm.

551
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,407
Just take a deep breath.

552
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,159
- Are you okay?
- No!

553
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:55,081
I promise,
I've got this all under control.

554
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,464
<i>Suit compromised.</i>

555
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,549
Nanotechnology.

556
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,552
Ah, you've outdone yourself, Peter.

557
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,435
I underestimated you.

558
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,105
But now you die.

559
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:36,956
You're not Peter Parker.

560
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,416
I am so confused right now.

561
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:43,254
What's happening?

562
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:44,797
<i>New device detected.</i>

563
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,175
<i>Pairing new device.</i>

564
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:54,932
You don't listen to him. You listen to me.

565
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:01,689
Hey.

566
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,537
Hey. Hey.

567
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,746
Listen to me.

568
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,457
No, not him. Me.

569
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,632
Ma'am, you okay?

570
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:30,259
You can still make your flight.

571
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:32,219
Peter.

572
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,014
You're a hero.

573
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,348
No. Well, I'm--

574
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:37,516
No, I'm--

575
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,394
I'm gonna talk to Admissions
about your friends.

576
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,896
And I'm gonna talk to them about you.

577
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,149
But, ma'am, this isn't about me.

578
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:49,195
I am going to talk to them
about your friends and you.

579
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:50,863
- Okay?
- Really?

580
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,949
And if you keep your noses clean,
maybe you'll have a fair shot.

581
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,868
Here. Get out of the way.
Let me get that man.

582
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,621
Hey. You. I see you. Come here!

583
00:33:58,704 --> 00:33:59,997
That was not okay.

584
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,165
Unbelievable.

585
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:03,834
Who are--?

586
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:05,085
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

587
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:08,047
Until you stop trying to kill me,
I'm in control, buddy,

588
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,800
of this whole tentacle situation
you got going on here, okay?

589
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,886
Now, who are you? What is going--?

590
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,146
No.

591
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:32,404
Osborn?

592
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,136
Doctor--?

593
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:08,232
Be careful what you wish for, Parker.

594
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,858
Let me out of here!

595
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:11,986
Can you please explain to me
what is going on?

596
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:13,696
That little spell that you botched

597
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,573
where you wanted everyone
to forget that Peter Parker's Spider-Man,

598
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:19,576
it started pulling in everyone
who knows Peter Parker's Spider-Man

599
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,329
from every universe into this one.

600
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:26,375
- From every universe?
- Who are you? And where am I?

601
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,961
I think it's better we don't engage
with them because, frankly,

602
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:33,173
the multiverse is a concept
about which we know frighteningly little.

603
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,259
The multiverse is real?

604
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:37,761
This shouldn't be possible.

605
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:40,097
- I thought you stopped the spell.
- No, I contained it.

606
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,433
It would appear
a few of them squeaked through.

607
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,810
After you left,
I detected an otherworldly presence.

608
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,646
I pursued it into the sewers,
where I found that...

609
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:50,733
slimy, green son of a gun.

610
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,110
Spell? As in magic?

611
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,612
What is this, a birthday party?

612
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:58,198
Who is this clown? What is this madness?

613
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:01,660
Watch this. Do you know
a Peter Parker who's Spider-Man?

614
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:03,203
- Yes.
- Is that him?

615
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:04,788
- No.
- See?

616
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,916
Here's what we gotta do.

617
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,336
I don't know how many visitors we've got--

618
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,963
I saw another one on the bridge.

619
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:16,508
He was like a flying green elf.

620
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,594
He sounds jolly. Start with him.

621
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,347
I need you to capture them,
bring them here while I figure out

622
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:25,100
how to get them back
before they destroy the fabric of reality,

623
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:26,977
or worse, Wong finds out.

624
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,146
Doctor Strange?

625
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,064
What?

626
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:33,942
My friends and I just got
a second chance to get into MIT,

627
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:36,820
and if the school sees me
fighting these crazy monsters--

628
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:38,614
- Hey, watch your mouth.
- I'm sorry, but--

629
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,908
Are you seriously
still talking about college?

630
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,957
- Hey, what did you just do?
- This.

631
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:51,919
Hey, you can't just--

632
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:57,841
- How did you do that?
- Lots of birthday parties.

633
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:05,599
Hey.

634
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,854
One shot, send them here, move on.
You're welcome.

635
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:12,564
- Get to work.
- Sir?

636
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,441
Now what?

637
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,278
This is my mess,
and I swear that I'll fix it,

638
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:19,905
but I'm gonna need help.

639
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:25,536
I can't believe
I'm in the Sanctum Sanctorum.

640
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:26,829
Neither can I.

641
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:30,040
So how did you know
you were a man of magic?

642
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:32,292
Because my Nana says
that we have it in our family,

643
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:35,421
- and I get these tinglings in my hands--
- Talk to your physician.

644
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:36,839
- Peter.
- Hey.

645
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,715
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

646
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:40,342
Sorry for dragging you into this.

647
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:43,220
- Help me find these guys.
- You don't have to apologize, okay?

648
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,389
You got us
a second shot at MIT. It's fine.

649
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,100
So how did the bad guys get here?

650
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:51,270
We screwed up a spell
trying to get you into college.

651
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:54,106
- You did it with magic?
- I thought it was the MIT lady you saved.

652
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:57,443
No, that was after.
Let's just focus on the good news, okay?

653
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,236
No, let's just focus on the bad news.

654
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:03,407
As of now, you have detected
zero multiversal trespassers,

655
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:07,744
so get on your phones,
scour the Internet, and...

656
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,413
Scooby-Doo this shit.

657
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:14,126
You're telling us what to do, even though
it was your spell that got screwed up,

658
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,295
meaning that all this is your mess.

659
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:21,133
I know a couple of magic words myself,
starting with the word "please."

660
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:26,555
Please Scooby-Doo this shit.

661
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:29,141
You can work in the undercroft.

662
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:32,019
The undercroft?

663
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:37,941
Badass.

664
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:47,659
- About this whole spell thing--
- It's totally okay.

665
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:49,745
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, I get it.

666
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:54,625
You were just trying
to fix things, and so...

667
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:57,419
Maybe just run it by us next time,
you know?

668
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:59,963
That way, when you're thinking,
"I'm about to do something

669
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:02,716
that could break the universe,"

670
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:06,053
we could, like, help you
workshop something or...

671
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:09,306
brainstorm ideas.

672
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,267
Deal.

673
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:14,895
Ned?

674
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:18,815
Oh, dude, I don't care.
It's seriously not a big deal.

675
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:23,070
A torture rack.

676
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,448
That is a Pilates machine.

677
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:28,575
- That is--
- The crypt.

678
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:30,827
Okay, so we get the rest of the guys,

679
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,913
you zap them,
Doctor Magic will send them back,

680
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:37,000
and when we get into MIT,
round of stale doughnuts, my treat.

681
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:38,794
Let's catch some multiverse men.

682
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,838
Hey! Who the hell are these two?

683
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:44,466
- My friends. This is MJ. And this is Ned.
- Hey.

684
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,384
Hello.

685
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:49,346
- Sorry, what was your name again?
- Dr. Otto Octavius.

686
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:56,061
Seriously, what's your actual name?

687
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,646
Oh, is that a dinosaur?

688
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,753
<i>If the paint won't come off,
I'll get it out.</i>

689
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:24,840
No, no, no, May.
We gotta find these guys first.

690
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,009
<i>Finish your mission and then come by.</i>

691
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,552
<i>We're having a canned food drive.</i>

692
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,346
- That could work.
- I got one.

693
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,764
- I gotta go.
- <i>Okay.</i>

694
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:34,933
I mean, you can take
the guy out of the chair,

695
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:37,144
but you can't take
the chair out of the guy.

696
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,605
- What'd you find?
- There's a...

697
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:43,358
A disturbance near a military
research facility outside of the city,

698
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:47,237
and witnesses say that they saw
a monster flying through the air.

699
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,699
It's gotta be the guy I saw on the bridge.

700
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,075
That's impossible.

701
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:55,787
You know him, don't you?

702
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:59,041
On the bridge, you said his name.

703
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,710
Norman Osborn.

704
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:05,839
Brilliant scientist. Military research.

705
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,843
But he was greedy, misguided.

706
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:14,181
- What happened to him?
- We tire of your questions, boy!

707
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:16,350
Okay.

708
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:20,896
- I gotta go. Where am I going?
- It can't be him.

709
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:24,316
Why?

710
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,861
Because Norman Osborn died years ago.

711
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:31,281
So either we saw someone else...

712
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:37,746
or you're flying out
into the darkness to fight a ghost.

713
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,939
Keep an eye out on the trees.
We don't know where this guy is.

714
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:09,820
I genuinely don't know
how you do this without throwing up.

715
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,047
Did you see that?

716
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,592
<i>-No.
- It is really dark.</i>

717
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,773
Okay, okay, okay.

718
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:54,865
<i>What's happening?</i>

719
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:56,032
<i>Peter, what is it?</i>

720
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,036
<i>Are you getting the tingle thing?</i>

721
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,539
<i>Is the tingle happening?
Is your tingle tingling?</i>

722
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,550
- Are you guys seeing this?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

723
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:16,678
- <i>Osborn?</i>
- No. He was green. This guy's blue.

724
00:43:18,305 --> 00:43:21,183
You wouldn't happen to be
from another universe, would you?

725
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,643
<i>What's he doing?</i>

726
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:26,897
- <i>I don't know. Looks like he's charging.</i>
- I don't like this. Just web him.

727
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:43,121
<i>Go left! Left, dude, left!
Left! Go! Left! Yes!</i>

728
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:47,083
<i>What are you talking about? Right.
Go to the right! Right! Right!</i>

729
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:50,921
- <i>He means right. Don't listen to him.</i>
- This is not helping!

730
00:43:57,427 --> 00:44:00,222
Oh, no, no, no.
What happened? Peter? Peter.

731
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:13,443
Peter, it's me, Flint Marko. You remember?

732
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:16,696
- I'm Peter, but I'm not your Peter.
- What do you mean, you're not my Peter?

733
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,784
- What the hell is going on?
- I'll explain, but first, can you help me?

734
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,744
- Okay.
- You try to surround him,

735
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:24,871
and I'll pull the plug.
All right, let's go!

736
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:41,888
I can't hold him much longer.

737
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:44,391
I got it, I got it!

738
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:14,379
Different Peter. Weird.

739
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:17,507
- Thanks. Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

740
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:27,225
I got my body back.

741
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:28,977
Hey.

742
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:33,690
This is gonna sound really crazy,
but this isn't your universe.

743
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:34,816
Another universe?

744
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,027
- What?
- That's what I was feeling.

745
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:40,113
The power, it's different.

746
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:42,866
I like it.

747
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:48,455
- Easy, buddy.
- It's actually my fault that you're here.

748
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:51,625
Like, the universe or the woods?

749
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:53,376
I hate the woods.

750
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,378
I meant, the universe, sir.

751
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:58,840
So, what, y'all just gonna stand here
and act like I ain't butt-ass naked?

752
00:45:58,924 --> 00:46:00,634
- I am.
- No, no.

753
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:02,218
I...

754
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:16,858
What was that?
What did you just do to him?

755
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:18,944
- No. It's okay.
- Did you kill him?

756
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:21,112
I can explain everything. Trust me.

757
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:23,949
- Please, just trust me.
- I don't trust you. I don't know you.

758
00:46:27,077 --> 00:46:28,161
What is this?

759
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:31,081
You picked the wrong side.

760
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:34,918
Connors?

761
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,588
Wait. You know this creature?

762
00:46:38,672 --> 00:46:41,716
No, no, no. Not a creature. A man.

763
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,010
The same universes.

764
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:48,139
Dr. Curt Connors. He was a scientist
at Oscorp when I worked there.

765
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:50,266
A brilliant scientist.

766
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,977
Until he turned himself into a lizard.

767
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,187
Then he tried to turn
the whole city into lizards.

768
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,690
- It was crazy.
- It wasn't crazy, Max.

769
00:46:56,773 --> 00:46:58,900
It was the next step in human evolution.

770
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:01,069
- The dinosaur can talk. Right.
- Lizard.

771
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,737
What happened to you?

772
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:06,574
Last I recall, you had bad teeth,
glasses and a comb-over.

773
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:08,451
Did you get a makeover?

774
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:11,788
You know I can give you a real makeover.

775
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,248
Let me guess, into a lizard?

776
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,917
- Exactly.
- Would you two just shut up?

777
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:17,711
- Where are we?
- It's complicated.

778
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:20,422
- A wizard's dungeon.
- Wizard's dungeon?

779
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:24,175
There's no real way to sugarcoat that.
It's literally the dungeon of a wizard.

780
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:25,760
You can keep your magic.

781
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:29,556
I want a taste of that energy I just felt.

782
00:47:33,018 --> 00:47:35,979
- Oh, Peter, hey.
- Did those guys come through yet?

783
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:38,064
There should be an electric guy
and a sand guy.

784
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:40,692
Yeah, they're all here and locked up.

785
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,695
Perfect. I'm gonna just stay here
and try and fix some of this damage,

786
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,530
so they don't blame it on me again.

787
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,449
- <i>Okay.</i>
- But, hey, I...

788
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:51,661
I couldn't do any of this without you,
so thank you.

789
00:47:51,745 --> 00:47:52,579
<i>Of course.</i>

790
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,957
Hey, ask him
if this is like a tree monster

791
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:58,418
or like a scientist
that turned into a tree.

792
00:47:58,501 --> 00:47:59,836
It's just a tree, man.

793
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:01,921
Just a tree.

794
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:22,442
<i>Coward. We have a new world to conquer.</i>

795
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:25,862
<i>You make me sick.</i>

796
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,739
Leave me alone, please.

797
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:30,450
<i>Hiding in the shadows.</i>

798
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:33,244
<i>Hiding from who you truly are.</i>

799
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:36,873
- No.
- <i>You can't escape yourself.</i>

800
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,433
- Hey, May.
- <i>Hey, Peter. I'm at work, and...</i>

801
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,520
<i>one of the guys
you're looking for just walked in.</i>

802
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,073
May? Where's May? Thank you.

803
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,285
May.

804
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:18,164
Hey, here he is.

805
00:49:18,248 --> 00:49:21,501
Norman, this is my nephew.

806
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:25,630
Norman Osborn? I thought that you were--

807
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:29,300
I saw Spider-Man in an ad for this place.

808
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,137
And I thought he could help me.

809
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:34,055
But you're not him.

810
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,474
Wait, so you want Spider-Man's help?

811
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:38,268
He just wandered in.

812
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,064
I didn't know where else to go.

813
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:46,609
Someone's living in my house.

814
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:50,196
Oscorp doesn't exist.

815
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:53,158
My son...

816
00:49:57,245 --> 00:50:00,206
Sometimes I'm not myself.

817
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:04,210
I'm... someone else.

818
00:50:04,294 --> 00:50:07,338
And every time he's in control,
I can't remember.

819
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:09,716
- Who's in control?
- And now I'm here--

820
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:12,969
- Who's in control?
- I don't know what's going on.

821
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:16,639
- Okay, it's okay.
- And I don't-- Doesn't make sense.

822
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:19,517
He's lost.

823
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:23,146
And I don't mean just in the cosmos.
I mean, in his mind.

824
00:50:26,149 --> 00:50:27,317
Are they all like this?

825
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:29,319
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

826
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:32,780
They all have their own mental
or physical issues.

827
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:35,783
Oh, well, he needs help
and maybe they all do.

828
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:39,913
Wait, you don't mean--?
No, May, this isn't my problem.

829
00:50:39,996 --> 00:50:41,915
Peter, not your problem?

830
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:46,419
May, their chance of getting help is
way better back where they came from.

831
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:51,341
Sending them home, that's the best thing
that we can do for them.

832
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:53,676
For them? Or for yourself?

833
00:50:56,763 --> 00:51:00,016
Look around you. This is what we do.

834
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:03,937
- We help people.
- This is what's best for them.

835
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:05,897
Trust me.

836
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:12,403
<i>But the fact remains,
Spider-Man is a menace.</i>

837
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:17,533
We'll be right back after a brief word
from <i>Daily Bugle</i> Supplements.

838
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:20,411
The only other daily fix you need.

839
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:21,537
And we're out.

840
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,375
What?

841
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:29,796
I got eyes on him.

842
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:32,090
- <i>He's with his aunt and some guy.</i>
- You sure?

843
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:35,134
- <i>They're just leaving the shelter.</i>
- Okay. Don't lose him.

844
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:49,023
Thanks, May. Hope to see you again.

845
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:53,027
Hey. He trusts you. So do I.

846
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:56,447
Thanks for cleaning my suit.

847
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:58,533
See you later.

848
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:03,871
- Guys, this is Mr. Osborn.
- Hey, it's "doctor."

849
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:06,207
Sorry. Dr. Osborn, these are my friends.

850
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:07,625
This is Ned and MJ.

851
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:11,963
- Mary Jane?
- It's Michelle Jones, actually.

852
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:14,882
Fascinating.

853
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:21,222
Do you think there are other Ned Leedses?

854
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:35,945
Octavius?

855
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:41,242
Osborn?

856
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:43,494
What happened to you?

857
00:52:43,578 --> 00:52:44,704
What happened to--?

858
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:48,916
- You're the walking corpse.
- What do you mean?

859
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,544
You died, Norman.

860
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:53,212
Years ago.

861
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:55,757
You're insane.

862
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,841
God, I love it here.

863
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:00,261
What are you talking about?
He's standing right there.

864
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:01,387
- He's not--
- Dead.

865
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:05,224
They both died, fighting Spider-Man.

866
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:11,105
It was all over the news.

867
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:16,027
Green Goblin, impaled
by the glider you flew around on.

868
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:20,740
And a couple of years later, you, Doc Ock,

869
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:23,868
- drowned in the river with your machine.
- Nonsense.

870
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:29,165
Spider-Man was trying to stop
my fusion reactor, so I stopped him.

871
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:33,503
I had him by the throat, and then I...

872
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:39,717
And then I was here.

873
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:44,138
Please. Let me tell you something.
I was whupping Spider-Man's ass.

874
00:53:44,222 --> 00:53:46,766
He'll tell you.
And then he caused an overload.

875
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:49,060
I was stuck in the grid, absorbing data.

876
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,521
I was about to turn
into pure energy, and then...

877
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:52,438
And then...

878
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:55,650
And then-- Oh, shit.

879
00:53:57,026 --> 00:54:01,406
- I was about to die.
- Max, do you know? Do I die?

880
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:06,953
- Oh, great. You caught another one.
- No, wait, Strange.

881
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:08,704
He's not dangerous.

882
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:11,666
It's okay.

883
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:15,753
What is that?

884
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:19,048
It's an ancient relic.
The Macchina di Kadavus.

885
00:54:19,132 --> 00:54:22,427
I've trapped your corrupted spell inside,
and once I finish the proper ritual,

886
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:26,556
it'll reverse the spell and send
these guys back to their universes.

887
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:29,142
And then what? We perish?

888
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:30,935
No. No, thanks. I'll pass on that.

889
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:34,021
Let me out of here. Peter!

890
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:37,900
Strange, we can't send them back. Not yet.

891
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:39,485
Why?

892
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:44,740
- Well, some of these guys are gonna die.
- Parker.

893
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,160
It's their fate.

894
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:49,620
Come on, have a heart.

895
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,500
In the grand calculus of the multiverse,

896
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:58,921
their sacrifice means infinitely more
than their lives.

897
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:05,803
I'm sorry, kid.

898
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:09,348
If they die, they die.

899
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:24,322
Peter!

900
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,920
Don't.

901
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,966
- What are you doing?
- Peter, you gotta go. Go.

902
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,051
- Okay.
- Get out of here.

903
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:49,138
This is why I never had kids.

904
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:04,946
- Give me the box.
- No.

905
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:24,799
Oh, my God, I'm dead.

906
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:27,802
You're not dead, you've just been
separated from your physical form.

907
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,845
My physical-- What?

908
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:32,598
How are you doing that?

909
00:56:32,682 --> 00:56:36,269
- I have no idea.
- You should not be able to do that.

910
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:37,812
This feels amazing.

911
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:50,825
One of the coolest things
that's ever happened to me,

912
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,368
but don't ever do that again.

913
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,501
Hey! Get off of me!

914
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,134
What is this place?

915
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:53,054
The Mirror Dimension,
where I'm in control.

916
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,732
Strange, stop.
Can we just talk about this?

917
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:07,818
Parker, don't you realize
that in the multiverse,

918
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:12,490
there are an infinite number of people
who know Peter Parker is Spider-Man?

919
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:15,451
And if that spell gets loose,
they're all coming here.

920
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:18,287
I know, I get it,
but we can't just send them home to die.

921
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:19,580
It's their fate.

922
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:23,250
You can't change that any more
than you could change who they are.

923
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:26,545
What if we could?
What if we could change their fate?

924
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:29,715
What are you doing?

925
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:36,097
I'm not giving you the--

926
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:48,776
Give me that back.

927
00:59:09,714 --> 00:59:11,966
Wait a minute.
Is that an Archimedean Spiral?

928
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:14,468
The dimension is just geometry?
You're great at geometry.

929
00:59:14,552 --> 00:59:16,137
You can do geometry.

930
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:19,932
Square the radius. Divide by pi.

931
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,143
- Plot points along the curve.
- It's over, Parker.

932
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:24,854
I'll come pick you up when it's done.

933
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:28,774
Hey, Strange.

934
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,193
You know what's cooler than magic?

935
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:37,575
- Math.
- Don't do this.

936
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:42,538
I'm sorry, sir, but...

937
00:59:47,168 --> 00:59:48,419
I have to try.

938
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:51,797
- What happened?
- I had a fight with Strange and I won.

939
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:54,091
- What happened?
- I had a fight with Strange and I won.

940
00:59:54,175 --> 00:59:56,177
- What?
- I stole his ring thing.

941
00:59:57,303 --> 01:00:01,056
I was swinging, and then I went
through this massive mirror thing,

942
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,767
- and then I was back--
- Where is he?

943
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,685
He's trapped,
but I'm not sure for how long.

944
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:06,771
You could have left us to die.

945
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:08,314
Why didn't you?

946
01:00:08,397 --> 01:00:09,857
'Cause that's not who he is.

947
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,279
I think I can help you guys.

948
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:18,073
If I can fix what happened to you,
then when you go back,

949
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:21,577
things will be different,
and you might not die fighting Spider-Man.

950
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,954
- What do you mean?
- Our technology is advanced--

951
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:28,501
I can help you. You know,
I'm something of a scientist myself.

952
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,379
Octavius knows what I can do.

953
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:35,007
Fix? You mean, like a dog?

954
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,425
I refuse.

955
01:00:36,509 --> 01:00:39,178
I can't promise you guys anything,
but at least this way,

956
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,472
you get to go home and have a chance.

957
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:42,723
A second chance.

958
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,226
Isn't that worth trying?

959
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:48,938
Trust me, Peter,
when you try to fix people,

960
01:00:49,021 --> 01:00:51,732
there are always consequences.

961
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:55,027
You don't have to come.
I also didn't know that you could talk.

962
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,570
But if you stay here...

963
01:00:57,613 --> 01:00:59,031
you'll have to deal with the wizard.

964
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:03,619
So we go along or die.
Not much of a choice, is it?

965
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,120
I just wanna go home.

966
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:08,916
I, myself, don't wanna be killed,
especially by a guy dressed

967
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:12,503
like Dungeons & Dragons,
so, what's your plan?

968
01:01:13,963 --> 01:01:15,631
I have it all under control.

969
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,136
What are we gonna do about this thing?

970
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:23,806
We need
to find somewhere safe for it, right?

971
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:26,100
- Yeah, sure. You gotta take it.
- Wait, what?

972
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:29,520
If something bad happens,
you just push this and then it's over.

973
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:31,397
We're not gonna leave you.

974
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,731
You can't. It's dangerous.

975
01:01:32,815 --> 01:01:34,817
- You have done enough.
- We're in this together.

976
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:38,445
I know we're in this together, Ned,
but I can't do this if you're in danger.

977
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:41,282
Okay? So for me, MJ,
please just take this.

978
01:01:44,243 --> 01:01:46,161
- Please.
- Fine.

979
01:01:46,829 --> 01:01:48,080
- Thank you.
- But, Peter,

980
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,416
if I don't hear from you,
I'm pressing the button.

981
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:52,710
- Sure.
- Okay. And I will do it.

982
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,838
Yeah, we all believe you, Michelle.

983
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:58,799
No way that's his girlfriend. No way.

984
01:01:58,883 --> 01:02:01,510
- She'll do it.
- Absolutely, she will.

985
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:05,764
- Okay. See you later.
- Be safe.

986
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:06,932
- You too.
- Okay.

987
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,104
Okay.

988
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:15,858
- Be careful, okay?
- Yeah. You too.

989
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:24,658
So...

990
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:27,578
who's coming with me?

991
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:32,708
Well, I'm in.

992
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:35,836
But if this goes sideways...

993
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,089
I'm gonna fry you from the inside out.

994
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,396
<i>-Where's Connors?
- He wants to stay in the truck.</i>

995
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,274
<i>-Okay.
- Alarm system deactivated.</i>

996
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,276
Hey, May.

997
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:02,988
- Yeah?
- I feel bad using Happy's place like this.

998
01:03:03,072 --> 01:03:05,074
No, no, no. He'll get over it.

999
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,953
<i>New Yorkers oppose
the Statue of Liberty renovation...</i>

1000
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:09,870
Oh, sorry.

1001
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,414
So this is your plan, Peter?

1002
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:14,500
No lab, no facilities?

1003
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:16,460
Just performing miracles in a condominium?

1004
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:20,589
What, you gonna cook us some cures
and some frozen burritos in a microwave?

1005
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:23,676
- I could go for a burrito.
- He's gonna kill us all.

1006
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:25,052
Well, let's hope not.

1007
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:27,930
- You're up first, Doc.
- What?

1008
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:29,598
Hey, I told you, I don't need fixing.

1009
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:32,434
I don't need fixing!

1010
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:36,855
Especially by a teenager using scraps
from a bachelor's junk drawer.

1011
01:03:36,939 --> 01:03:39,525
Nah, nah, nah.
He got something back there.

1012
01:03:40,067 --> 01:03:42,403
I can feel it. That weird energy.

1013
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:46,407
- What the hell is that?
- It's a fabricator.

1014
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:50,536
It can analyze, design,
construct basically anything.

1015
01:03:51,537 --> 01:03:53,789
I thought that was
the tanning bed Happy broke.

1016
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:57,710
Look at that.

1017
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:06,552
He's gonna kill us all.

1018
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:17,187
What's going on there?

1019
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:20,983
So the chip in the back of Doc's neck
was designed to protect his brain

1020
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:24,737
from the Al system that's controlling
these tentacles, but if you look here...

1021
01:04:27,156 --> 01:04:27,990
the chip is fried.

1022
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:30,325
So rather than him being
in control of the tentacles,

1023
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:32,494
the tentacles are now in control of him.

1024
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:37,666
Which, I guess, explains why
he is so miserable all the time.

1025
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:46,884
Thirsty?

1026
01:04:50,179 --> 01:04:51,597
Well, yes, I am thirsty.

1027
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:53,807
Fresh water or salt?

1028
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:56,477
You know, because you're an octopus.

1029
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,688
What?

1030
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:02,483
Fresh water it is.

1031
01:05:03,609 --> 01:05:04,777
Look at this place.

1032
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:08,864
- And all the possibilities.
- What, this condo?

1033
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:12,034
Yeah, yeah, the condo.
I love the whole open floor plan. No.

1034
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:14,328
Nah, man, I'm talking about the world.

1035
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:17,206
I kind of like who I am here.

1036
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,584
And all that power back there...

1037
01:05:21,877 --> 01:05:23,378
I could be so much more.

1038
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:25,839
So why'd you come along?

1039
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:28,717
I have a daughter, and I want to see her.

1040
01:05:28,801 --> 01:05:30,928
But he's not gonna send anyone home

1041
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:33,847
till he's finished
his little science project back there.

1042
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:35,641
You trust him?

1043
01:05:35,724 --> 01:05:37,017
I don't trust anyone.

1044
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:40,604
How'd you end up like that, anyway?

1045
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:43,774
The place where I worked at,

1046
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:48,612
they were experimenting with electricity
created by living organisms, and then...

1047
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:51,824
I fell into a vat of electric eels.

1048
01:05:51,907 --> 01:05:54,910
You're kidding.
I fell into a supercollider.

1049
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:55,828
Damn.

1050
01:05:56,954 --> 01:05:58,622
Gotta be careful where you fall.

1051
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:00,833
Remarkable.

1052
01:06:02,793 --> 01:06:04,711
The technology and you.

1053
01:06:07,548 --> 01:06:08,882
When all this is over,

1054
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:14,138
if you need a job and you're willing
to commute to another universe...

1055
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:23,647
It worked. That totally worked!

1056
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:26,942
- I got it. I did it. Will you send him up?
- Here we go.

1057
01:06:28,694 --> 01:06:30,154
- Sorry.
- Hold on, Doc.

1058
01:06:30,237 --> 01:06:32,823
Oh, will these humiliations never cease?

1059
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:35,909
You, keep your science-fair project
away from me!

1060
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:37,619
It'll work. Have faith.

1061
01:06:37,703 --> 01:06:40,706
Says the reckless fool
who turned himself into a monster.

1062
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:43,250
Please stop moving your head.

1063
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:46,420
- Hold still.
- Don't you dare.

1064
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:55,554
I swear, when I get out of this,
we're gonna rip you a new--

1065
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:01,059
Doc?

1066
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:07,816
Doc?

1067
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:10,777
Doc?

1068
01:07:12,029 --> 01:07:12,988
Dr. Octav--

1069
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:21,246
It's so quiet.

1070
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:28,003
Those voices inside my head...

1071
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:34,676
I'd almost forgotten.

1072
01:07:36,178 --> 01:07:37,012
Otto.

1073
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:40,265
Yes. Norman.

1074
01:07:46,605 --> 01:07:47,814
It's me.

1075
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:51,401
Would you look at that?

1076
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:15,133
I'm grateful, dear boy. Truly.

1077
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:16,510
Yeah, you're welcome.

1078
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:18,345
How can I help?

1079
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:21,223
<i>This is Peter. Leave a message.</i>

1080
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:25,769
Yeah, Peter, this is Happy.
I accessed my doorbell camera.

1081
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:28,063
Who are those guys, huh? Is that a cyborg?

1082
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,524
You bring a cyborg
with robot legs into my house?

1083
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:33,110
Was one of the guys made of mud?
What's going on? Call me.

1084
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:43,537
How does it feel, Norman?

1085
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:46,665
You're about to become whole again.

1086
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,793
No more darker half.

1087
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:51,628
Just you.

1088
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:53,880
Just me.

1089
01:09:03,307 --> 01:09:04,391
Okay.

1090
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:07,436
It just goes right here. This...

1091
01:09:09,271 --> 01:09:10,772
That should be drawing power now.

1092
01:09:10,856 --> 01:09:14,568
I'll come back in a second to check on it,
but keep an eye on the lights.

1093
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:17,571
When they're all green,
the electricity in your body's dissipated.

1094
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:21,408
Well, not all of the electricity. You need
electricity for your brain to function.

1095
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:22,868
Your nervous system is...

1096
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:26,038
I'm not really sure
why I'm explaining electricity to you.

1097
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,665
- Yeah, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1098
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:29,875
Are these your Legos?

1099
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,171
I gotta go. I'll be back.

1100
01:09:40,052 --> 01:09:42,387
- Something feels off.
- What do you mean?

1101
01:09:43,764 --> 01:09:46,058
- I don't like this.
- Leave it alone.

1102
01:09:46,141 --> 01:09:50,103
The sooner you guys get through this,
the sooner we go home.

1103
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:00,113
- Well, where is he?
- He's inside.

1104
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:01,865
And yet here we are, outside.

1105
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:03,950
Did you not hear me say, "Don't lose him"?

1106
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:05,952
I want incriminating footage
of Spider-Man.

1107
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:07,996
I called Damage Control.
They're on their way.

1108
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,748
And so it begins.

1109
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:11,625
Place is about to be swarming with cops.

1110
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:31,561
- Peter?
- Peter?

1111
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,356
What's wrong?

1112
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:36,566
I don't know.

1113
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,568
May?

1114
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:45,492
What is it, Peter?

1115
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:54,167
What's happening?

1116
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:02,884
Why are you looking at me like that?

1117
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:23,363
That's some neat trick,
that sense of yours.

1118
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:26,950
- Norman?
- Norman's on sabbatical, honey.

1119
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:29,911
- The hell?
- The Goblin.

1120
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:35,917
"No more darker half"? Did you really
think that I'd let that happen?

1121
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:40,297
That I'd let you take away my power
just because you're blind

1122
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,758
- to what true power can bring you?
- You don't know me.

1123
01:11:43,842 --> 01:11:45,051
Don't I?

1124
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:51,057
I saw how she trapped you,

1125
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:53,768
fighting her holy moral mission.

1126
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:58,690
We don't need you to save us.

1127
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,817
We don't need to be fixed.

1128
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:06,323
These are not curses.

1129
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:09,326
They're gifts.

1130
01:12:10,702 --> 01:12:12,704
- Norman, no.
- Quiet, lapdog.

1131
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:15,373
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- I've watched you

1132
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:19,252
from deep behind Norman's cowardly eyes.

1133
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:25,258
Struggling to have everything you want

1134
01:12:25,342 --> 01:12:28,887
while the world tries to make you choose.

1135
01:12:31,056 --> 01:12:34,309
Gods don't have to choose.

1136
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:37,896
We take.

1137
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:39,439
May, run.

1138
01:13:02,754 --> 01:13:03,880
Oh, my God.

1139
01:13:04,756 --> 01:13:07,842
- What have you done?
- I liked you better before.

1140
01:13:17,269 --> 01:13:20,397
Up here! He's up there.
It's the guy from the bridge.

1141
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:44,296
Did you see that?

1142
01:14:10,864 --> 01:14:11,948
No, you don't!

1143
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,710
Strong enough to have it all.

1144
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,465
Too weak to take it!

1145
01:15:04,084 --> 01:15:05,377
Now I got you.

1146
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:09,881
I told you, there'd be consequences!

1147
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:31,569
Your weakness, Peter, is morality.

1148
01:15:32,112 --> 01:15:35,990
It's choking you. Can't you feel it?

1149
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:45,667
It didn't work.

1150
01:15:47,085 --> 01:15:48,712
Norman was right.

1151
01:15:48,795 --> 01:15:52,465
He got it from you,
that pathetic sickness.

1152
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,805
You tried to fix me.

1153
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:00,849
May, go.

1154
01:16:00,932 --> 01:16:03,143
Now I'm gonna fix you.

1155
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:08,273
May, run, please.

1156
01:16:12,277 --> 01:16:13,111
May!

1157
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:21,745
Peter, Peter, Peter.

1158
01:16:21,828 --> 01:16:24,914
No good deed goes unpunished.

1159
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,667
You can thank me later.

1160
01:16:33,548 --> 01:16:34,799
No!

1161
01:17:04,704 --> 01:17:05,538
- May?
- Peter.

1162
01:17:05,622 --> 01:17:06,915
May, May, I'm here.

1163
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:11,795
May.

1164
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:13,463
May, I'm here.

1165
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:16,841
Are you okay? What happened?

1166
01:17:23,181 --> 01:17:25,183
It's okay. We're okay, right?

1167
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:26,976
Yeah. Knocked on my ass.

1168
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,186
- Yeah, me too.
- That's all.

1169
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:31,898
I think I broke my ribs.

1170
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,447
- This is all my fault, May.
- No.

1171
01:17:39,531 --> 01:17:41,491
I should have let Strange send them back.

1172
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:42,700
You did the right thing.

1173
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:46,663
They would have been killed.
You did the right thing.

1174
01:17:47,372 --> 01:17:49,415
It's not my responsibility, May.

1175
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:54,212
What Norman said?

1176
01:17:55,630 --> 01:17:57,549
My moral mission? No.

1177
01:17:57,632 --> 01:17:59,717
- No, May--
- Peter, you listen to me.

1178
01:18:01,094 --> 01:18:02,095
You have a gift.

1179
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,056
You have power.

1180
01:18:05,932 --> 01:18:07,350
And with great power,

1181
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:10,645
there must also come great responsibility.

1182
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:17,443
I know.

1183
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:19,445
Let's get the...out of here.

1184
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:20,655
Okay, let's go.

1185
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:23,533
Let me just catch my...

1186
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,634
- What happened? Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1187
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:43,469
Yeah, you're okay. What happened?

1188
01:18:45,305 --> 01:18:46,389
Just have to...

1189
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:48,516
catch my breath.

1190
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,518
Okay, well, catch your breath.
I'm right here.

1191
01:18:50,602 --> 01:18:51,728
We're gonna take our time.

1192
01:18:51,811 --> 01:18:54,814
You catch your breath
and then we'll take you to a doctor, okay?

1193
01:19:13,291 --> 01:19:14,292
Are you okay?

1194
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:18,254
Somebody help!
I need an ambulance, please! Somebody?

1195
01:19:18,338 --> 01:19:20,256
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

1196
01:19:21,341 --> 01:19:22,967
You're okay, you're okay.

1197
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,180
Let me just-- Let me catch my breath.

1198
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:29,140
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1199
01:19:29,724 --> 01:19:30,725
I'm right here.

1200
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:38,775
You're okay.

1201
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:41,486
It's just me and you.

1202
01:19:51,746 --> 01:19:52,580
May?

1203
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:00,088
May?

1204
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:07,887
Will you look at me, please?

1205
01:20:16,688 --> 01:20:17,522
May.

1206
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:19,524
May.

1207
01:20:21,526 --> 01:20:22,568
What are you doing, May?

1208
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:25,530
Please, will you just wake up
and talk to me? Please?

1209
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:50,179
Get out of the car now! Move!

1210
01:20:56,728 --> 01:20:58,396
Get off, get off, get <i>off</i> me.

1211
01:21:00,732 --> 01:21:01,566
Peter!

1212
01:21:01,649 --> 01:21:03,443
- Run!
- It's just me and you, okay?

1213
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:05,403
It's just me and you, okay?

1214
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:07,238
Oh, May, I'm sorry.

1215
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:08,489
I'm so sorry.

1216
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:12,785
- I'm so, so, so sorry. I love you.
- Parker, come out with your hands up!

1217
01:21:13,453 --> 01:21:15,913
Come out right now, or we will open fire!

1218
01:21:15,997 --> 01:21:16,956
Run!

1219
01:21:20,877 --> 01:21:23,212
All right, let's go, let's go! Move in!

1220
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:42,190
<i>Tragedy.</i>

1221
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:47,528
<i>What else can I call it?</i>

1222
01:21:48,738 --> 01:21:50,656
<i>What more need be said?</i>

1223
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:54,160
<i>The damage, the destruction.</i>

1224
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:56,829
<i>You saw it with your own eyes.</i>

1225
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:03,294
<i>When will people wake up and realize
that everywhere Spider-Man goes,</i>

1226
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:06,214
<i>chaos and calamity ensue?</i>

1227
01:22:07,048 --> 01:22:11,135
<i>Everything Spider-Man touches
comes to ruin.</i>

1228
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,222
<i>And we, the innocents,</i>

1229
01:22:14,889 --> 01:22:16,849
<i>are left to pick up the pieces.</i>

1230
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:21,479
<i>J. Jonah Jameson reporting.</i>

1231
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:24,649
<i>Good night, and God help us all.</i>

1232
01:22:44,252 --> 01:22:47,505
<i>We are told
that multiple people have been injured,</i>

1233
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:52,051
<i>and we can confirm
at least one person has been killed.</i>

1234
01:22:52,135 --> 01:22:53,177
Still nothing?

1235
01:22:54,846 --> 01:22:55,721
No.

1236
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:12,655
I'm gonna press it.

1237
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,368
- What? No, he--
- I know he told me to wait...

1238
01:23:18,828 --> 01:23:20,997
- but I'm gonna do it.
- I just wish--

1239
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,790
I just wish we could see him.

1240
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:29,172
- Ned?
- Yeah?

1241
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:31,632
- Do that again.
- Yeah.

1242
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:35,344
I just wish we could see him.

1243
01:23:39,265 --> 01:23:40,099
Okay.

1244
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:42,685
I just wish we could see Peter.

1245
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:51,402
<i>Lola,</i> you're right. I am magic.

1246
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:53,529
Is that him?

1247
01:23:54,447 --> 01:23:56,824
- Yeah, yeah, it has to be.
- Peter. Peter!

1248
01:23:56,908 --> 01:23:58,951
- Hey, Peter! Yeah.
- Peter!

1249
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:08,961
Hi. Hi.

1250
01:24:09,045 --> 01:24:12,131
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay. I'm a nice guy.

1251
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,135
Okay.

1252
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:21,265
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Peter Parker.

1253
01:24:21,349 --> 01:24:25,519
- That's not possible.
- I am Spider-Man, in my world.

1254
01:24:25,603 --> 01:24:28,689
But then yesterday, I was--

1255
01:24:30,441 --> 01:24:32,235
I was just here.

1256
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:40,201
String theory, multidimensional reality...

1257
01:24:41,494 --> 01:24:42,995
and matter displacement.

1258
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:44,580
All real?

1259
01:24:44,664 --> 01:24:45,665
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1260
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:46,958
I knew it.

1261
01:24:48,668 --> 01:24:50,461
This has to be because of the spell.

1262
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:52,838
The spell? Like magic spell?

1263
01:24:52,922 --> 01:24:54,757
- There's no spell. No.
- No spell.

1264
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,592
- Magic's real here too?
- I mean--

1265
01:24:56,676 --> 01:24:58,511
- Shut up, Ned.
- No, it's not real.

1266
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:01,722
- Shut up. Stop talking.
- There's magicians, but there's no--

1267
01:25:01,806 --> 01:25:03,474
Stop. Stop.

1268
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:05,601
- Prove it.
- Prove what?

1269
01:25:05,685 --> 01:25:09,063
- That you're Peter Parker.
- I don't carry an ID with me, you know?

1270
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:11,565
Kind of defeats
the whole anonymous superhero thing.

1271
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:16,404
- Why'd you do that?
- To see if you have the tingle thing.

1272
01:25:16,487 --> 01:25:18,447
I have the tingle thing,
just not for bread.

1273
01:25:18,531 --> 01:25:20,533
Can you not throw the bread again?

1274
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:22,868
You're a deeply mistrusting person...

1275
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:25,621
and I respect it.

1276
01:25:31,294 --> 01:25:32,128
Crawl around.

1277
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:34,130
- Crawl around?
- Yes.

1278
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:35,798
- No.
- Yes, crawl around.

1279
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:37,508
- Why do I need to?
- This is not enough.

1280
01:25:37,591 --> 01:25:38,884
- This is plenty.
- No, it's not.

1281
01:25:38,968 --> 01:25:40,636
- Yes, it is. It is.
- No, it's not. No.

1282
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,264
- How do I stick to the ceiling?
- Do it.

1283
01:25:45,099 --> 01:25:45,975
Ned.

1284
01:25:51,564 --> 01:25:54,984
My <i>iota's</i> asking if you could
just get the cobweb there.

1285
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,944
- Since you're, like, up there.
- Yeah.

1286
01:26:04,952 --> 01:26:05,828
Thank you.

1287
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:11,584
We--

1288
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:13,044
We good?

1289
01:26:13,127 --> 01:26:14,045
For now.

1290
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:17,715
So I opened the wrong portal
to the wrong Peter Parker.

1291
01:26:17,798 --> 01:26:20,092
I guess you keep doing it
until we find the real one.

1292
01:26:21,052 --> 01:26:22,094
No offense.

1293
01:26:22,762 --> 01:26:24,263
- Okay.
- Okay. You got it.

1294
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,017
Find Peter Parker.

1295
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,144
What's the thing on his hand?

1296
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:32,229
Find Peter Parker.

1297
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:35,775
Find Peter Parker!

1298
01:26:45,159 --> 01:26:46,619
Great, it's just some random guy.

1299
01:26:47,495 --> 01:26:48,371
Hello.

1300
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:51,499
I hope it's okay,
I just came through this...

1301
01:26:53,376 --> 01:26:54,377
It just closed.

1302
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,171
You're Peter?

1303
01:26:57,963 --> 01:27:00,174
Yeah. Peter Parker.

1304
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:03,969
I've seen you two--

1305
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,264
Hi.

1306
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:14,146
Wait. He's-- He's not your friend.

1307
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:33,249
Wait. So you're Spider-Man too?
Why didn't you just say that?

1308
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:35,835
I generally don't go around
advertising it.

1309
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:38,003
Kind of defeats
the whole anonymous superhero thing.

1310
01:27:38,087 --> 01:27:39,880
- I just said that.
- That's what he just said.

1311
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:55,729
My <i>iota's</i> asking if you could clean up
the webs you just shot.

1312
01:27:55,813 --> 01:27:57,523
- Oh, sorry, <i>Lola.</i>
- Yes, of course.

1313
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:58,983
I'm going to bed.

1314
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:01,318
- Night, <i>Lola.</i>
- Good night, Ned's <i>Lola.</i>

1315
01:28:02,486 --> 01:28:04,280
This might seem kind of weird,

1316
01:28:04,822 --> 01:28:07,450
but I've been trying to find
your friend ever since I got here.

1317
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,744
I just have this sense...

1318
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,165
that he needs my help.

1319
01:28:14,248 --> 01:28:15,249
Our help.

1320
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:18,294
He does.

1321
01:28:18,377 --> 01:28:20,087
We don't know where he is.

1322
01:28:20,171 --> 01:28:24,175
And, honestly,
right now we're all he really has left.

1323
01:28:25,676 --> 01:28:30,681
Well, is there someplace that he might go

1324
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:32,933
that has meaning to him?

1325
01:28:34,435 --> 01:28:37,938
Like a place where he would go to just--?

1326
01:28:38,022 --> 01:28:39,523
Get away from everything?

1327
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:45,863
For me, it was the top
of the Chrysler Building.

1328
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:47,198
Empire State.

1329
01:28:47,281 --> 01:28:50,451
- It's just a-- It's a better view.
- That is a sweet view.

1330
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:54,121
Yes.

1331
01:28:55,164 --> 01:28:58,125
Yeah. I think
I know exactly where that would <i>be.</i>

1332
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:35,204
I'm sorry.

1333
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,046
Peter, there's...

1334
01:29:45,589 --> 01:29:47,091
There's some people here.

1335
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:49,426
What?

1336
01:29:58,602 --> 01:29:59,937
Hey, wait, wait, whoa.

1337
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:02,064
What...?

1338
01:30:05,109 --> 01:30:05,943
Sorry...

1339
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:08,821
about May.

1340
01:30:12,533 --> 01:30:14,618
Yeah. Sorry.

1341
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:18,706
I got some understanding
of what it is you're--

1342
01:30:18,789 --> 01:30:21,417
No, please don't tell me
that you know what I'm going through.

1343
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:23,919
- Okay.
- She's gone.

1344
01:30:26,964 --> 01:30:28,299
And it's all my fault.

1345
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:33,804
She died for nothing.

1346
01:30:37,725 --> 01:30:39,518
So I'll do what I should have done
in the first place.

1347
01:30:40,144 --> 01:30:41,854
- Peter--
- Please don't.

1348
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:46,233
You don't belong here. Either of you.
So I'm sending you home.

1349
01:30:47,818 --> 01:30:49,987
Those other guys are
from your worlds, right?

1350
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:52,406
So you deal with it.

1351
01:30:52,489 --> 01:30:54,408
If they die, if you kill them...

1352
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:56,201
that's on you.

1353
01:30:57,411 --> 01:30:58,287
It's not my problem.

1354
01:30:59,246 --> 01:31:00,497
I don't care anymore.

1355
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:02,750
I'm done.

1356
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:10,007
I'm really sorry
that I dragged you into this.

1357
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:15,387
But you have to go home now.

1358
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:18,766
Good luck.

1359
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,023
My Uncle Ben was killed.

1360
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:28,942
It was my fault.

1361
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:31,403
I lost...

1362
01:31:34,573 --> 01:31:36,116
I lost Gwen, my...

1363
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:38,952
She was my MJ.

1364
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,040
I couldn't save her.

1365
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:47,086
I'm never gonna be able
to forgive myself for that.

1366
01:31:50,214 --> 01:31:51,924
But I carried on, tried to...

1367
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:55,552
Tried to keep going,
tried to keep being...

1368
01:31:57,304 --> 01:31:59,181
the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man

1369
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:01,433
'cause I know that's
what she would've wanted.

1370
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:05,479
But at some point,
I just stopped pulling my punches.

1371
01:32:09,525 --> 01:32:10,651
I got rageful.

1372
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:14,446
I got bitter.

1373
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:19,910
I just don't want you to end up like me.

1374
01:32:21,704 --> 01:32:23,997
The night Ben died...

1375
01:32:25,332 --> 01:32:27,459
I hunted down the man
who I thought did it.

1376
01:32:29,336 --> 01:32:30,629
I wanted him dead.

1377
01:32:33,507 --> 01:32:34,967
I got what I wanted.

1378
01:32:37,428 --> 01:32:38,971
It didn't make it better.

1379
01:32:42,975 --> 01:32:45,185
It took me a long time...

1380
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:48,856
to learn to get through that darkness.

1381
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:53,444
I wanna kill him.

1382
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,781
I wanna tear him apart.

1383
01:33:01,827 --> 01:33:03,662
I can still hear her voice in my head.

1384
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:10,919
Even after she was hurt,

1385
01:33:11,003 --> 01:33:13,088
she said to me
that we did the right thing.

1386
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:24,057
She told me that with great power...

1387
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:27,978
Comes great responsibility.

1388
01:33:33,442 --> 01:33:34,860
Wait, what? How do you know that?

1389
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:36,487
Uncle Ben said it.

1390
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:38,030
The day he died.

1391
01:33:42,743 --> 01:33:44,828
Maybe she didn't die for nothing, Peter.

1392
01:33:54,922 --> 01:33:58,926
Okay, so Connors, Marko, Dillon and...

1393
01:34:01,053 --> 01:34:03,514
I think that I can repair
the devices for Dillon and Marko,

1394
01:34:03,597 --> 01:34:04,807
but the others...

1395
01:34:05,474 --> 01:34:08,685
Oh, I got Connors.
I've cured him once, so no big deal.

1396
01:34:10,354 --> 01:34:12,231
- What? It's no big deal.
- Great.

1397
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:14,233
Yeah, that's great.

1398
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:19,780
I think I can make an antiserum
for Dr. Osborn.

1399
01:34:20,948 --> 01:34:22,574
Been thinking about it a long time.

1400
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:28,372
Gotta cure all of them. Right?

1401
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:30,833
Right.

1402
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:33,794
That's what we do.

1403
01:34:42,261 --> 01:34:43,136
What?

1404
01:34:43,804 --> 01:34:45,180
Just three yous.

1405
01:35:03,407 --> 01:35:06,451
So... do you have a best friend too?

1406
01:35:08,871 --> 01:35:09,705
I did.

1407
01:35:11,915 --> 01:35:12,875
You did?

1408
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:16,169
He died in my arms...

1409
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:19,673
after he tried to kill me.

1410
01:35:21,717 --> 01:35:23,135
It was heartbreaking.

1411
01:35:25,387 --> 01:35:26,471
Dude.

1412
01:35:33,437 --> 01:35:35,898
- Hey.
- Will you run a diagnostic?

1413
01:35:35,981 --> 01:35:36,815
Yeah.

1414
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:47,451
Hey, you okay?

1415
01:35:49,036 --> 01:35:50,746
Yeah, I'm fine. Are you okay?

1416
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:56,209
You don't deserve this.

1417
01:35:57,669 --> 01:36:00,797
- I've ruined your life. I ruined it.
- No. No, no, no.

1418
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:03,425
Look at me. I'm here.

1419
01:36:05,052 --> 01:36:06,219
Not going anywhere.

1420
01:36:08,138 --> 01:36:11,141
We'll get through this
and we'll get through it together.

1421
01:36:12,184 --> 01:36:13,018
Okay?

1422
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:16,396
- Okay.
- Okay.

1423
01:36:21,485 --> 01:36:22,402
Thank you.

1424
01:36:33,914 --> 01:36:35,332
You have someone?

1425
01:36:36,166 --> 01:36:37,000
No.

1426
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:42,381
I got no time
for Peter Parker stuff, you know?

1427
01:36:44,466 --> 01:36:45,634
Do you?

1428
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:49,096
That's a little complicated.

1429
01:36:50,097 --> 01:36:51,306
I understand.

1430
01:36:51,390 --> 01:36:53,767
I guess it's just not
in the cards for guys like us.

1431
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:56,520
Well, I wouldn't give up.

1432
01:36:56,603 --> 01:36:59,523
Took a while, but we made it work.

1433
01:36:59,606 --> 01:37:01,233
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1434
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:04,027
Me and... MJ.

1435
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:06,780
My MJ.

1436
01:37:08,532 --> 01:37:10,075
It gets confusing here.

1437
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:12,285
Yeah.

1438
01:37:12,369 --> 01:37:14,371
- Peter!
- Yeah?

1439
01:37:14,454 --> 01:37:17,874
- Oh, sorry, did you mean...?
- "Peter" Peter.

1440
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:19,793
- We're all called Peter.
- We're all Peter.

1441
01:37:19,876 --> 01:37:22,921
- Peter Parker?
- Same again. We're all Peter Parker.

1442
01:37:23,005 --> 01:37:24,131
The computer.

1443
01:37:25,882 --> 01:37:27,342
- Oh, I'm ready.
- Yeah. Me too.

1444
01:37:27,426 --> 01:37:32,431
Okay, so now, all we gotta do is lure
these guys someplace, right?

1445
01:37:32,514 --> 01:37:36,018
Try to cure them
while they try to kill us,

1446
01:37:36,101 --> 01:37:37,644
and then send them home.

1447
01:37:37,728 --> 01:37:40,355
- Using a magic box.
- Well, that's the plan.

1448
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:42,941
Are you gonna go into battle
dressed as a cool youth pastor,

1449
01:37:43,025 --> 01:37:44,609
or do you got your suit?

1450
01:37:46,653 --> 01:37:47,487
Good.

1451
01:37:47,571 --> 01:37:50,032
- Here's your <i>web</i> cartridges.
- Thanks, man.

1452
01:37:50,115 --> 01:37:51,324
What's that for?

1453
01:37:51,408 --> 01:37:54,244
It's my web fluid.
It's for my web shooters. Why?

1454
01:37:57,581 --> 01:37:59,416
- That came out of you.
- Yeah.

1455
01:37:59,499 --> 01:38:01,168
- You can't do that, huh?
- No.

1456
01:38:01,251 --> 01:38:03,003
How on earth does that even--?

1457
01:38:03,086 --> 01:38:05,839
We're getting sidetracked.
This is where we'll do this, okay?

1458
01:38:05,922 --> 01:38:07,674
It's isolated, so no one should get hurt.

1459
01:38:08,425 --> 01:38:10,844
We draw them there with the box.
It's the one thing they all want.

1460
01:38:10,927 --> 01:38:13,055
All we have to do is figure out
how to get there.

1461
01:38:13,138 --> 01:38:14,556
- We could portal there.
- What?

1462
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:17,059
- I'm magic now.
- Yeah, he's right. He can.

1463
01:38:17,142 --> 01:38:18,810
- Yeah, we saw.
- Yeah, he is.

1464
01:38:19,311 --> 01:38:21,188
- Wait, really?
- I got Doctor Strange magic.

1465
01:38:21,271 --> 01:38:22,481
- No way.
- Yeah.

1466
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:26,568
I promise you, I won't turn
into a supervillain and try to kill you.

1467
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:30,030
Okay.

1468
01:38:30,989 --> 01:38:32,240
Thank you.

1469
01:38:38,205 --> 01:38:40,957
Here goes nothing.
What's that thing you always say?

1470
01:38:41,666 --> 01:38:44,044
- Expect disappointment and--
- No, no, no.

1471
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:47,089
We're gonna kick some ass.

1472
01:38:47,172 --> 01:38:48,173
Okay.

1473
01:38:48,882 --> 01:38:51,343
Cure. Cure some ass.

1474
01:38:51,426 --> 01:38:53,261
Cure that ass.

1475
01:38:55,722 --> 01:38:56,973
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1476
01:38:57,057 --> 01:38:58,934
<i>the</i> Bugle <i>tip line has
just received a call</i>

1477
01:38:59,017 --> 01:39:02,270

1478
01:39:02,354 --> 01:39:04,815
<i>fresh from his rampage in Queens.</i>

1479
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:09,694
<i>So, Peter Parker, what pernicious

1480
01:39:09,778 --> 01:39:11,446
<i>-Just the truth.
- Oh, sure.</i>

1481
01:39:11,530 --> 01:39:12,697
<i>Truth is...</i>

1482
01:39:14,241 --> 01:39:15,575
<i>that this is all my fault.</i>

1483
01:39:16,535 --> 01:39:19,079
<i>I accidentally brought

1484
01:39:19,162 --> 01:39:20,831
Well, he admits it.

1485
01:39:20,914 --> 01:39:22,457
<i>And if those people are watching...</i>

1486
01:39:24,501 --> 01:39:26,378

1487
01:39:27,754 --> 01:39:29,297

01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:32,717

1490

- <i>That's why I'm here.</i>
- Where is "here," exactly?

1491
01:39:42,936 --> 01:39:44,980
A place that represents second chances.

1492
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:50,652
<i>The Statue of Liberty? Good God, folks.</i>

1493
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:53,989

1494
01:39:54,072 --> 01:39:55,740

01:39:55,824 --> 01:39:57,409
<i>Believe me, the world is watching.</i>

1496
01:39:58,451 --> 01:39:59,578
...wish me luck.

1497
01:40:01,538 --> 01:40:03,748
Your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man could use some.

1498
01:40:10,297 --> 01:40:12,382
Okay, it could be any minute now.

1499
01:40:12,465 --> 01:40:14,676
Yep, almost done.

1500
01:40:19,598 --> 01:40:24,186
You know, Max was,
like, the sweetest guy ever

1501
01:40:24,811 --> 01:40:26,146
before he fell into...

1502
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:29,691
- a pool of electric eels.
- That'll do it.

1503
01:40:32,485 --> 01:40:33,820
Oh, there it goes.

1504
01:40:35,947 --> 01:40:37,115
You okay?

1505
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:39,034
Oh, it's my back.

1506
01:40:39,117 --> 01:40:42,412
It's kind of stiff
from all the swinging, I guess.

1507
01:40:42,495 --> 01:40:44,664
- Yeah. No, I got a middle back thing too.
- Really?

1508
01:40:44,748 --> 01:40:46,875
Yeah. You want me to crack it?

1509
01:40:48,168 --> 01:40:49,419
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1510
01:40:49,502 --> 01:40:50,921
- That'd be great.
- All right.

1511
01:40:52,505 --> 01:40:53,590
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1512
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:58,511
Yep. That's good.

1513
01:40:59,304 --> 01:41:00,138
How is it?

1514
01:41:02,724 --> 01:41:05,143
- That's good. That's better.
- Right? Yeah.

1515
01:41:09,397 --> 01:41:12,234
This is so cool. I always wanted brothers.

1516
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:16,905
So you, like,
make your own web fluid in your body?

1517
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:18,698
I'd rather not talk about this.

1518
01:41:18,782 --> 01:41:20,742
- I don't mean to--
- But are you teasing me?

1519
01:41:20,825 --> 01:41:24,663
No, no, no. He's not teasing you.
It's just that we can't do that,

1520
01:41:24,746 --> 01:41:28,250
so we're curious as to how
your web situation works, that's all.

1521
01:41:28,333 --> 01:41:31,044
If it's personal, I don't wanna pry,
but I think it's cool.

1522
01:41:31,127 --> 01:41:34,214
I-- I wish I could tell you,
but it's, like, I don't do it.

1523
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:36,591
Like I don't do breathing.

1524
01:41:36,675 --> 01:41:38,635
Like, breathing just happens.

1525
01:41:38,718 --> 01:41:43,056
Does it just come out of your wrists,
or does it come out of anywhere else?

1526
01:41:43,139 --> 01:41:45,350
Only-- Only the wrists.

1527
01:41:45,433 --> 01:41:47,644
Never had a <i>web</i> block?
I run out of webs all the time.

1528
01:41:47,727 --> 01:41:50,230
- I have to make my own in a lab.
- Right. That's--

1529
01:41:50,313 --> 01:41:53,275
- It's a hassle compared to what you got.
- Sounds like a hassle.

1530
01:41:53,358 --> 01:41:56,820
But I did. You said that,
I was like, "I had a <i>web</i> block."

1531
01:41:57,445 --> 01:41:59,906
- Why?
- Existential crisis stuff.

1532
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:02,409
- Yeah. Don't get me started on that.
- Hey.

1533
01:42:02,951 --> 01:42:06,037
What are some of the craziest villains
that you guys have fought?

1534
01:42:06,121 --> 01:42:08,832
- Seems you've met some of them.
- That's a good question.

1535
01:42:08,915 --> 01:42:14,254
Yeah, I fought an alien
made out of black goo once.

1536
01:42:14,337 --> 01:42:16,423
Oh, no way. I fought an alien too.

1537
01:42:16,506 --> 01:42:18,216
On Earth and in space.

1538
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:20,093
- He was purple.
- I wanna fight an alien.

1539
01:42:20,176 --> 01:42:23,930
I'm still, like, that you fought
an alien in space.

1540
01:42:24,848 --> 01:42:29,060
I'm lame compared-- I fought
a Russian guy in a rhinoceros machine.

1541
01:42:29,144 --> 01:42:31,855
Can we rewind it back
to the "I'm lame" part?

1542
01:42:31,938 --> 01:42:33,148
'Cause you are not.

1543
01:42:33,231 --> 01:42:35,317
Thanks. I appreciate that.
I'm not saying I am--

1544
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,360
But it's just the self-talk.
Maybe we should...

1545
01:42:37,444 --> 01:42:40,196
- Listen, I--
- 'Cause you're amazing.

1546
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:42,198
Just to take it in for a minute.

1547
01:42:42,282 --> 01:42:44,784
- Yeah, I can take it in.
- You are amazing.

1548
01:42:44,868 --> 01:42:46,578
- I can. Thank you.
- You are amazing.

1549
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:49,706
- Will you say it?
- I needed to hear that. Thank you.

1550
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:52,625
All right, guys, focus up. You feel that?

1551
01:42:52,709 --> 01:42:53,543
Yeah.

1552
01:43:01,134 --> 01:43:02,218
What's up, Peter?

1553
01:43:05,305 --> 01:43:06,806
How you like the new-new?

1554
01:43:07,974 --> 01:43:11,853
Look, you give it to me,
I'm gonna destroy it.

1555
01:43:13,021 --> 01:43:14,481
But I'll let you live.

1556
01:43:15,148 --> 01:43:16,691
Don't make me a murderer, Peter.

1557
01:43:19,569 --> 01:43:20,945
Okay, guys, here he comes.

1558
01:43:27,911 --> 01:43:30,205
Hey, Max! I missed you, man.

1559
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,043
All right, MJ, heads up!

1560
01:43:36,086 --> 01:43:37,253
Got it. Close it.

1561
01:43:41,299 --> 01:43:43,385
- Ned, it's not closing.
- Yeah, I know.

1562
01:43:43,468 --> 01:43:45,053
- Why isn't it closing?
- I don't know.

1563
01:43:45,136 --> 01:43:48,181
- Did you close it before? No?
- I mean, I've opened some.

1564
01:43:57,107 --> 01:43:59,526
Max, Max, Max. Can we talk for a second?

1565
01:43:59,609 --> 01:44:01,694
- Just you and me, just talk?
- Look who showed up.

1566
01:44:02,404 --> 01:44:03,696
My old friend Spider-Man.

1567
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:05,740
I'm trying to save you.
That's all I've wanted.

1568
01:44:05,824 --> 01:44:07,409
- You're not trying to save me.
- I am.

1569
01:44:07,492 --> 01:44:09,285
You ain't even the shit no more.

1570
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:12,705
Don't worry about me. I'll save myself.

1571
01:44:13,415 --> 01:44:14,541
Burn up!

1572
01:44:16,209 --> 01:44:17,836
Well, I got his attention. Now what?

1573
01:44:17,919 --> 01:44:19,421
Okay, great.

1574
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:23,174
Just FYI, lizard guy's here too.

1575
01:44:24,884 --> 01:44:26,302
Guys, comm check. Hello?

1576
01:44:27,512 --> 01:44:30,098
- <i>I need Max's cure!</i>
- Yeah. I'm on it.

1577
01:44:31,057 --> 01:44:32,475
<i>Peter, I need the Lizard cure.</i>

1578
01:44:33,393 --> 01:44:34,436
Okay, okay.

1579
01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:41,484
Where's the box, Peter?

1580
01:44:41,568 --> 01:44:44,362
- Flint, we could help everyone.
- I don't care.

1581
01:44:55,748 --> 01:44:56,624
Sorry!

1582
01:44:58,209 --> 01:44:59,294
Gross!

1583
01:44:59,377 --> 01:45:02,046
Sad to tell you, Sandman,
nobody's going home.

1584
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:42,795
What the hell is going on out there?

1585
01:45:42,879 --> 01:45:44,631
I keep yelling at you, Peter 2!

1586
01:45:44,714 --> 01:45:47,842
- But I thought you were Peter 2.
- What? I'm not Peter 2.

1587
01:45:47,926 --> 01:45:50,178
Stop arguing, both of you!
Listen to Peter 1.

1588
01:45:50,261 --> 01:45:53,181
- We're clearly not very good at this.
- I know, I know. We suck.

1589
01:45:53,264 --> 01:45:56,100
- I don't know how to work as a team.
- Me neither.

1590
01:45:56,184 --> 01:45:58,144
I do. I've been in a team, okay?

1591
01:45:58,228 --> 01:46:00,855
I don't wanna brag, but I will.
I was in the Avengers.

1592
01:46:00,939 --> 01:46:02,273
- The Avengers?
- Yeah.

1593
01:46:02,357 --> 01:46:03,566
- That's great.
- Thank you.

1594
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:04,526
What is that?

1595
01:46:05,693 --> 01:46:06,903
You don't have the Avengers?

1596
01:46:06,986 --> 01:46:08,488
Is that a band? Are you in a band?

1597
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:11,950
No, I'm not in a band.
The Avengers is Earth's mightiest--

1598
01:46:12,033 --> 01:46:13,785
- How's this helping?
- It's not important.

1599
01:46:13,868 --> 01:46:15,703
All we gotta do is focus,
trust your tingle,

1600
01:46:15,787 --> 01:46:17,205
and coordinate our attacks.

1601
01:46:17,288 --> 01:46:19,999
Yes. Okay. Let's pick one target.

1602
01:46:20,083 --> 01:46:22,460
- Right.
- We take them off the board one at a time.

1603
01:46:22,544 --> 01:46:25,129
- You got it. Okay, Peter 1, Peter 2.
- Peter 2.

1604
01:46:25,213 --> 01:46:26,506
- Peter 3.
- Peter 3.

1605
01:46:26,589 --> 01:46:28,508
- Let's do this. Ready?
- Wait, wait, wait!

1606
01:46:29,467 --> 01:46:30,677
I love you guys.

1607
01:46:33,346 --> 01:46:34,472
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1608
01:46:36,099 --> 01:46:37,642
- All right, let's do this.
- Let's go.

1609
01:47:07,589 --> 01:47:08,673
Okay, Spider-Mans.

1610
01:47:09,632 --> 01:47:11,092
Sandman's first.

1611
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:15,096
- I'm gonna lead him inside the statue.
- I'll meet you at the top.

1612
01:47:18,057 --> 01:47:19,434
- Come on!
- Hey!

1613
01:47:22,854 --> 01:47:25,732
- Hey, Dr. Connors.
- Hello, Peter.

1614
01:47:27,025 --> 01:47:28,234
Peter 1!

1615
01:47:28,318 --> 01:47:29,193
I got it!

1616
01:47:40,913 --> 01:47:43,374
Flint, we're trying to help you!

1617
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:47,128
Guys, I'm at the top!

1618
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:48,338
I need the cure!

1619
01:47:50,882 --> 01:47:52,425
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1620
01:47:54,385 --> 01:47:58,222
Just wait your turn, doc!

1621
01:47:58,306 --> 01:47:59,432
I'll be right back.

1622
01:48:36,678 --> 01:48:37,887
It's okay, Flint.

1623
01:48:40,139 --> 01:48:41,766
We're gonna get you home.

1624
01:48:42,558 --> 01:48:44,477
You just stay right here.

1625
01:48:49,649 --> 01:48:51,943
How do we stop him?
I've never seen him this powerful.

1626
01:48:52,026 --> 01:48:54,112
It's the arc reactor.
We gotta get it off him.

1627
01:48:54,195 --> 01:48:55,530
You're not gonna take this from me.

1628
01:48:58,700 --> 01:48:59,659
That's not gonna work.

1629
01:49:04,914 --> 01:49:06,541
We gotta do this up close.

1630
01:49:06,624 --> 01:49:09,460
Peter 2, go right.
Peter 3, go left. On me.

1631
01:49:14,507 --> 01:49:15,341
Yeah!

1632
01:49:36,988 --> 01:49:40,158
I'm trying to close it.
I can't help that it's not working.

1633
01:49:40,241 --> 01:49:43,077
It's fine. You'll do it again.
We'll keep trying.

1634
01:49:43,161 --> 01:49:46,289
- All right, we got this.
- Focus and close the portal.

1635
01:49:49,625 --> 01:49:51,377
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1636
01:49:51,461 --> 01:49:54,005
And that is a lizard and we should go!

1637
01:49:58,593 --> 01:49:59,427
Run!

1638
01:50:00,428 --> 01:50:02,889
Come on! Come on, this way!
Quick, quick, quick!

1639
01:50:02,972 --> 01:50:04,223
Connors, stop!

1640
01:50:13,608 --> 01:50:14,734
Yeah.

1641
01:50:27,205 --> 01:50:29,749
Leave them. They're mine.

1642
01:50:29,832 --> 01:50:32,418
I don't need your help.
I got it just fine.

1643
01:50:32,502 --> 01:50:34,670
Dr. Octavius, no.

1644
01:50:37,256 --> 01:50:38,633
What are you doing?

1645
01:50:40,301 --> 01:50:41,511
Get it off of me.

1646
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:53,606
There you go.

1647
01:51:12,834 --> 01:51:13,709
MJ!

1648
01:51:26,097 --> 01:51:27,849
- We gotta hide this thing.
- Oh, right.

1649
01:51:32,103 --> 01:51:33,729
- Nice, Ned!
- Yeah!

1650
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:38,317
Where is he?

1651
01:51:38,401 --> 01:51:39,944
- No!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1652
01:51:40,027 --> 01:51:44,073
Before you do anything, Mister--
Doctor Strange, Peter's plan is working.

1653
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:45,908
- What plan?
- He's curing them.

1654
01:51:54,959 --> 01:51:56,085
Dr. Connors?

1655
01:51:59,505 --> 01:52:00,590
Welcome back, sir.

1656
01:52:02,675 --> 01:52:03,926
Well, I'll be damned.

1657
01:52:06,888 --> 01:52:08,514
Did you just open a portal?

1658
01:52:09,515 --> 01:52:10,683
Yes, sir, I did.

1659
01:52:18,441 --> 01:52:19,483
Max?

1660
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:22,194
Max?

1661
01:52:22,278 --> 01:52:25,406
- Don't worry. I'm all tapped out.
- Are you sure about that?

1662
01:52:27,366 --> 01:52:28,659
Back to being a nobody.

1663
01:52:28,743 --> 01:52:32,038
- You were never a nobody, Max.
- Yes, I was.

1664
01:52:32,663 --> 01:52:33,748
You didn't see me.

1665
01:52:35,291 --> 01:52:37,960
- Can I tell you something though?
- Yeah.

1666
01:52:39,003 --> 01:52:40,755
You got a nice face. You're just a kid.

1667
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:43,424
You're from Queens.

1668
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:47,803
You got that suit.
You help a lot of poor people.

1669
01:52:47,887 --> 01:52:49,722
I just thought you was gonna be Black.

1670
01:52:50,932 --> 01:52:53,309
- Oh, man, I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

1671
01:52:53,392 --> 01:52:55,811
There's gotta be a Black Spider-Man
somewhere out there.

1672
01:52:59,273 --> 01:53:00,483
Goddamn eels.

1673
01:53:04,236 --> 01:53:05,655
The power of the sun.

1674
01:53:08,908 --> 01:53:10,409
In the palm of your hand.

1675
01:53:10,493 --> 01:53:11,702
Peter?

1676
01:53:14,288 --> 01:53:15,122
Otto.

1677
01:53:17,083 --> 01:53:18,793
Oh, it's good to see you, dear boy.

1678
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:21,087
It's good to see you.

1679
01:53:21,879 --> 01:53:23,089
You're all grown up.

1680
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:25,883
How are you?

1681
01:53:28,177 --> 01:53:29,220
Trying to do better.

1682
01:53:36,644 --> 01:53:38,521
- Strange, wait, we're so close.
- Skip it!

1683
01:53:38,604 --> 01:53:41,399
I've been dangling
over the Grand Canyon for 12 hours.

1684
01:53:41,482 --> 01:53:43,150
I know, I know, I know. I--

1685
01:53:45,403 --> 01:53:47,238
I'm sorry about that, sir. I mean...

1686
01:53:47,321 --> 01:53:50,324
- You went to the Grand Canyon?
- He could have used your help.

1687
01:53:50,408 --> 01:53:52,576
It's okay. These are my new friends.

1688
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:55,121
This is Peter Parker, Peter Parker.
Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

1689
01:53:55,204 --> 01:53:56,789
They're mes from other universes.

1690
01:53:56,872 --> 01:53:59,625
They're here to help.
This is the wizard I told you about.

1691
01:53:59,709 --> 01:54:03,045
I am really impressed that you've managed
to give them all a second chance, kid.

1692
01:54:04,255 --> 01:54:06,382
But this has to end. Now.

1693
01:54:06,465 --> 01:54:09,844
Can the Spider-Man come out to play?

1694
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:32,992
Strange, no!

1695
01:55:02,271 --> 01:55:03,481
Are you okay?

1696
01:55:04,565 --> 01:55:05,441
Yeah.

1697
01:55:05,524 --> 01:55:06,692
I'm okay.

1698
01:55:09,695 --> 01:55:10,821
Are you okay?

1699
01:56:28,357 --> 01:56:29,859
Thank you, Mr. Cape, sir.

1700
01:56:33,195 --> 01:56:34,029
Ned?

1701
01:56:35,447 --> 01:56:36,490
- Ned!
- Hey!

1702
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:42,037
MJ!

1703
01:56:42,121 --> 01:56:43,289
Peter?

1704
01:56:43,372 --> 01:56:45,207
- Ned!
- Peter!

1705
01:56:46,083 --> 01:56:47,251
Hey!

1706
01:56:47,334 --> 01:56:49,378
- Are you okay?
- We're okay!

1707
01:57:03,517 --> 01:57:04,768
Poor Peter.

1708
01:57:05,519 --> 01:57:09,023
Too weak to send me home to die.

1709
01:57:09,773 --> 01:57:10,608
No.

1710
01:57:11,483 --> 01:57:13,194
I just wanna kill you myself.

1711
01:57:14,028 --> 01:57:14,862
Attaboy.

1712
01:59:05,222 --> 01:59:06,557
She was there...

1713
01:59:07,558 --> 01:59:09,560
because of you.

1714
01:59:09,643 --> 01:59:11,895
I may have struck the blow,

1715
01:59:12,813 --> 01:59:14,231
but you...

1716
01:59:17,651 --> 01:59:20,863
You are the one that killed her.

1717
01:59:47,806 --> 01:59:48,640
Peter.

1718
02:00:02,279 --> 02:00:03,489
What have I done?

1719
02:00:07,576 --> 02:00:09,286
- It's you.
- You okay?

1720
02:00:10,788 --> 02:00:12,623
Yeah, I'm good. I've been stabbed before.

1721
02:00:12,706 --> 02:00:14,333
- Oh, good, good, good.
- Hey.

1722
02:00:14,416 --> 02:00:16,794
- Oh, man.
- Hey, nice catch.

1723
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:18,796
Nice throw.

1724
02:00:21,423 --> 02:00:25,803
- What? Is that happening, or am I dying?
- Yeah, no, that's happening. That's real.

1725
02:00:25,886 --> 02:00:27,638
Are there people in the sky?

1726
02:00:36,355 --> 02:00:38,607
- I gotta go.
- Yeah. I got it. You okay?

1727
02:00:43,112 --> 02:00:44,405
What's happening?

1728
02:00:44,488 --> 02:00:46,698
They're starting to come through.
I can't stop them.

1729
02:00:46,782 --> 02:00:49,827
There's gotta be something we could do.
Can't you just cast the spell again?

1730
02:00:49,910 --> 02:00:53,497
- The original way, before I screwed it up.
- We're too late for that. They're here.

1731
02:00:54,581 --> 02:00:56,625
They're here because of you.

1732
02:01:02,089 --> 02:01:03,590
What if everyone forgot who I was?

1733
02:01:03,674 --> 02:01:06,343
- What?
- They're coming here because of me, right?

1734
02:01:06,427 --> 02:01:07,970
Because I'm Peter Parker?

1735
02:01:08,512 --> 02:01:09,721
So cast a new spell.

1736
02:01:09,805 --> 02:01:12,224
But this time, make everyone forget
who Peter Parker is.

1737
02:01:12,307 --> 02:01:13,684
Make everyone forget...

1738
02:01:15,644 --> 02:01:17,062
- me.
- No.

1739
02:01:17,146 --> 02:01:19,940
- But it would work, right?
- Yeah, it would work.

1740
02:01:21,358 --> 02:01:23,944
But you gotta understand
that would mean that everyone

1741
02:01:24,027 --> 02:01:26,572
who knows and loves you, we...

1742
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:30,617
We'd have no memory of you.

1743
02:01:32,411 --> 02:01:34,246
It would be as though you never existed.

1744
02:01:37,624 --> 02:01:38,459
I know.

1745
02:01:40,502 --> 02:01:41,795
Do it.

1746
02:01:45,424 --> 02:01:48,093
You better go and say your goodbyes.
You don't have long.

1747
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:50,762
- Thank you, sir.
- Call me Stephen.

1748
02:01:54,433 --> 02:01:55,309
Thank you, Stephen.

1749
02:01:57,352 --> 02:02:00,147
Yeah. Still feels weird.

1750
02:02:02,816 --> 02:02:04,109
I'll see you around.

1751
02:02:05,944 --> 02:02:06,987
So long, kid.

1752
02:02:14,995 --> 02:02:15,829
Hey.

1753
02:02:16,955 --> 02:02:19,500
I think this is it.
I think you're about to go home.

1754
02:02:19,583 --> 02:02:21,084
- Okay.
- All right.

1755
02:02:21,168 --> 02:02:22,169
Look, I...

1756
02:02:24,588 --> 02:02:25,589
Thank you.

1757
02:02:26,507 --> 02:02:29,635
I just wanna-- I want you to--
I wanna tell you that--

1758
02:02:30,344 --> 02:02:32,304
I don't know how to say this. I--

1759
02:02:32,387 --> 02:02:34,056
- Peter.
- I want you to know that I...

1760
02:02:35,766 --> 02:02:38,268
You know. It's what we do.

1761
02:02:40,145 --> 02:02:41,480
Yeah, it's what we do.

1762
02:02:43,065 --> 02:02:45,484
Right, I gotta find Ned and MJ. I--

1763
02:02:47,027 --> 02:02:49,029
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1764
02:02:53,408 --> 02:02:55,911
- I guess I'll see you.
- See you.

1765
02:02:55,994 --> 02:02:56,870
Bye.

1766
02:03:00,123 --> 02:03:01,375
You're in so much pain, huh?

1767
02:03:01,458 --> 02:03:02,584
- I am.
- Yeah.

1768
02:03:06,672 --> 02:03:07,923
Oh, you're okay.

1769
02:03:09,675 --> 02:03:10,801
So proud of you.

1770
02:03:11,885 --> 02:03:14,221
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, we're okay.

1771
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:16,723
- Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

1772
02:03:16,807 --> 02:03:18,225
- You sure?
- I'm fine, I promise.

1773
02:03:18,892 --> 02:03:20,143
- Okay, okay.
- I promise.

1774
02:03:20,227 --> 02:03:21,061
Good.

1775
02:03:22,771 --> 02:03:24,940
We should go, right?

1776
02:03:27,484 --> 02:03:30,279
Yeah. You're gonna forget who I am.

1777
02:03:32,281 --> 02:03:34,575
- What?
- Forget? What are you talking about?

1778
02:03:35,993 --> 02:03:40,706
It's okay. I'm gonna come and find you,
and I'll explain everything.

1779
02:03:42,624 --> 02:03:44,167
I'll make you remember me.

1780
02:03:45,002 --> 02:03:48,088
And it'll be like none of this
ever happened. Okay?

1781
02:03:48,171 --> 02:03:51,508
But what if that doesn't work?
What if that doesn't work?

1782
02:03:51,592 --> 02:03:53,969
What if we can't remember you?
I don't wanna do that.

1783
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:57,598
- I don't wanna do that.
- I know. MJ, I know.

1784
02:03:57,681 --> 02:04:01,143
There's not something we can do?
We can't come up with a plan?

1785
02:04:01,226 --> 02:04:02,728
There's always something we can do.

1786
02:04:04,855 --> 02:04:06,064
There's nothing we can do.

1787
02:04:10,694 --> 02:04:11,778
But it'll be okay.

1788
02:04:16,283 --> 02:04:17,117
You promise?

1789
02:04:20,287 --> 02:04:21,580
Yeah, I promise.

1790
02:04:33,008 --> 02:04:34,509
I'll come find you, okay?

1791
02:04:35,135 --> 02:04:36,386
I know you will.

1792
02:04:37,888 --> 02:04:38,972
- Okay.
- Okay.

1793
02:04:41,391 --> 02:04:42,684
You better.

1794
02:04:44,645 --> 02:04:48,440
If you don't, I'll just figure it out.
I've done it before, I can do it again.

1795
02:04:50,150 --> 02:04:51,652
I promise, I'll fix this.

1796
02:04:53,028 --> 02:04:54,279
I really hate magic.

1797
02:04:55,989 --> 02:04:57,115
Yeah. Me too.

1798
02:05:01,870 --> 02:05:02,954
I love you.

1799
02:05:09,378 --> 02:05:10,796
- I love--
- Just wait.

1800
02:05:12,005 --> 02:05:14,341
Wait and tell me when you see me again.

1801
02:05:16,343 --> 02:05:17,177
Sure.

1802
02:06:44,973 --> 02:06:45,807
<i>I love you.</i>

1803
02:07:24,971 --> 02:07:28,016
<i>It's been a few weeks
since the fiasco on the Statue of Liberty,</i>

1804
02:07:28,099 --> 02:07:31,061
and Spider-Man's cultists
continue to contend

1805
02:07:31,144 --> 02:07:33,605
that the vile vigilante is a hero.

1806
02:07:34,481 --> 02:07:38,652
If he were a hero, he'd unmask himself
and tell us who he really is

1807
02:07:38,735 --> 02:07:42,239
because only a coward
conceals his identity.

1808
02:07:42,322 --> 02:07:45,492
Only a coward hides his true intentions.

1809
02:07:45,575 --> 02:07:47,661
<i>Rest assured, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1810
02:07:47,744 --> 02:07:52,040
<i>this reporter will uncover
those intentions, come hell or high water.</i>

1811
02:07:52,123 --> 02:07:55,710
Hi. My name is Peter Parker.
You don't know me, but I...

1812
02:07:58,463 --> 02:08:01,049
Hi, my name is Peter Parker,
and you don't know me, but you--

1813
02:08:04,845 --> 02:08:05,929
Okay, come on.

1814
02:08:08,306 --> 02:08:09,933
- No way.
- Hard to believe, isn't it?

1815
02:08:19,693 --> 02:08:20,694
Hey.

1816
02:08:26,157 --> 02:08:28,618
One sec. Can I help you?

1817
02:08:28,702 --> 02:08:29,536
Hi.

1818
02:08:30,412 --> 02:08:33,081
My name is Peter Parker, and I...

1819
02:08:36,793 --> 02:08:39,462
would like a coffee, please.

1820
02:08:40,255 --> 02:08:42,465
Okay, no problem, Peter Parker.

1821
02:08:49,055 --> 02:08:51,433
Doughnut for my fellow Engineer.

1822
02:08:52,517 --> 02:08:55,353
- Wait, what?
- MIT, they're the Engineers. The mascot.

1823
02:08:55,437 --> 02:08:57,939
Oh, right, right, right.
I should probably know that.

1824
02:08:58,023 --> 02:09:02,027
- Look at you with the school spirit.
- Tell anybody, I will deny it.

1825
02:09:02,110 --> 02:09:03,320
Oh, okay.

1826
02:09:13,496 --> 02:09:15,707
Peter Parker? Peter Parker.

1827
02:09:16,458 --> 02:09:17,626
Your coffee.

1828
02:09:17,709 --> 02:09:19,002
Right. Thank you.

1829
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:23,548
Are you excited for MIT?

1830
02:09:25,050 --> 02:09:27,177
Oh, right. Yeah.

1831
02:09:28,678 --> 02:09:30,722
Yeah, I am excited, which is weird

1832
02:09:30,805 --> 02:09:33,141
'cause I don't really
get excited about things,

1833
02:09:33,224 --> 02:09:34,893
I kind of expect disappointment.

1834
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:37,270
'Cause then you'll never
actually be disappointed.

1835
02:09:38,188 --> 02:09:39,022
Right?

1836
02:09:42,025 --> 02:09:43,777
Yeah. Right.

1837
02:09:45,111 --> 02:09:49,032
I don't know, it kind of feels different
this time for some reason.

1838
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:00,835
Right.

1839
02:10:02,629 --> 02:10:03,630
What I was--

1840
02:10:13,223 --> 02:10:14,057
You okay?

1841
02:10:15,517 --> 02:10:17,060
It doesn't really hurt anymore.

1842
02:10:28,279 --> 02:10:30,281
Is there anything else?

1843
02:10:43,044 --> 02:10:43,878
No.

1844
02:10:47,799 --> 02:10:48,842
Thank you.

1845
02:10:49,843 --> 02:10:50,760
No problem.

1846
02:10:57,225 --> 02:10:58,435
I'll see you around.

1847
02:12:03,833 --> 02:12:04,959
How'd you know her?

1848
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:10,048
Through Spider-Man.

1849
02:12:11,049 --> 02:12:11,966
You?

1850
02:12:12,050 --> 02:12:13,093
Same.

1851
02:12:18,681 --> 02:12:20,475
I lost a good friend a while back.

1852
02:12:21,351 --> 02:12:22,352
Felt like this.

1853
02:12:25,313 --> 02:12:27,732
Hurts 'cause they're gone
and then it hurts all over again

1854
02:12:27,816 --> 02:12:29,484
because you remember
what they stood for

1855
02:12:29,567 --> 02:12:32,612
and you wonder, "ls all that gone too?"

1856
02:12:37,450 --> 02:12:38,701
No, it's not gone.

1857
02:12:41,746 --> 02:12:43,373
Everyone that she helped...

1858
02:12:45,834 --> 02:12:46,960
they'll keep it going.

1859
02:12:48,336 --> 02:12:49,546
You really think so?

1860
02:12:50,839 --> 02:12:51,840
I know it.

1861
02:12:54,008 --> 02:12:57,387
- Take care of yourself, okay?
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.

1862
02:13:04,811 --> 02:13:08,064
Rent is due on the first
of the month. Don't be late.

1863
02:13:59,574 --> 02:14:01,784
<i>Four-three-Edward, do you need EMS assist?</i>

1864
02:14:01,868 --> 02:14:02,869
<i>Negative, Central.</i>

1865
02:14:03,703 --> 02:14:04,954
<i>We're gonna need a car tow.</i>

1866
02:17:19,732 --> 02:17:20,566
Okay.

1867
02:17:22,276 --> 02:17:23,778
Okay, I think I got this.

1868
02:17:23,861 --> 02:17:27,573
You're saying that this whole place here,

1869
02:17:27,657 --> 02:17:29,575
it's just tons of...

1870
02:17:30,743 --> 02:17:32,120
super people.

1871
02:17:32,203 --> 02:17:34,914
<i>And he has been saying it for hours.</i>

1872
02:17:35,706 --> 02:17:38,835
All right, tell me again.
I'm sorry, I'm an idiot.

1873
02:17:38,918 --> 02:17:42,755
There was a billionaire,
he had a tin suit and he could fly, right?

1874
02:17:45,091 --> 02:17:48,094
Okay, and there was
a really angry green man.

1875
02:17:48,177 --> 02:17:49,720
- Hulk.
- Hulk.

1876
02:17:49,804 --> 02:17:52,181
<i>And you thought
Lethal Protector was a shit name.</i>

1877
02:17:52,265 --> 02:17:54,308
Yeah, because it is.

1878
02:17:54,392 --> 02:17:58,729
Now tell me again about
your purple alien that loves stones.

1879
02:17:58,813 --> 02:18:01,482
'Cause I'll tell you what, man,
aliens do not love stones.

1880
02:18:01,566 --> 02:18:03,568
- <i>Eddie, don't start.</i>
- They don't.

1881
02:18:03,651 --> 02:18:05,653
Know what aliens love? Eating brains.

1882
02:18:05,736 --> 02:18:07,905
Because that's what they do. All right?

1883
02:18:07,989 --> 02:18:10,616
Señor, he made my family disappear.

1884
02:18:12,034 --> 02:18:13,077
For five years.

1885
02:18:14,495 --> 02:18:15,538
Five years?

1886
02:18:17,832 --> 02:18:18,958
That's a long time.

1887
02:18:21,627 --> 02:18:22,962
Maybe I...

1888
02:18:23,045 --> 02:18:25,756
Maybe I should go to New York
and speak to this...

1889
02:18:27,300 --> 02:18:28,301
Spider-Man.

1890
02:18:28,384 --> 02:18:31,429
<i>Eddie, we are drunk.</i>

1891
02:18:33,264 --> 02:18:35,725
- <i>Letis go skinny-dip!</i>
- I don't think we should skinny-dip.

1892
02:18:35,808 --> 02:18:36,934
You have to pay the bill.

1893
02:18:37,727 --> 02:18:39,061
<i>What is happening? No!</i>

1894
02:18:39,145 --> 02:18:41,522
<i>No, we just got here! No, not again!</i>

1895
02:18:46,194 --> 02:18:47,361
And there he goes.

1896
02:18:48,070 --> 02:18:50,990
Without paying the bill, no tips, nothing.

1897
02:26:01,545 --> 02:26:03,547
<i>Don't cast that spell.</i>

1898
02:26:03,631 --> 02:26:05,633
<i>-It is too dangerous.
- Why?</i>

1899
02:26:05,716 --> 02:26:08,552
<i>We tampered with
the stability of space-time.</i>

1900
02:26:09,136 --> 02:26:14,099
<i>The multiverse is a concept
about which we know frighteningly little.</i>

1901
02:26:16,060 --> 02:26:17,978
<i>Your desecration of reality...</i>

1902
02:26:19,313 --> 02:26:20,648
<i>will not go unpunished.</i>

1903
02:26:26,570 --> 02:26:27,905
<i>It was the only way.</i>

1904
02:26:33,118 --> 02:26:37,581
<i>But I never meant
for any of this to happen.</i>

1905
02:26:56,475 --> 02:26:57,309
Wanda.

1906
02:26:59,603 --> 02:27:02,189
Well, I knew sooner or later
you'd show up.

1907
02:27:03,190 --> 02:27:06,026
I made mistakes, and people were hurt.

1908
02:27:06,110 --> 02:27:08,445
I'm not here to talk about Westview.

1909
02:27:09,446 --> 02:27:10,739
Then what are you here for?

1910
02:27:10,823 --> 02:27:11,824
We need your help.

1911
02:27:13,325 --> 02:27:14,576
With what?

1912
02:27:14,660 --> 02:27:16,286
What do you know about the multiverse?

1913
02:27:25,170 --> 02:27:26,338
I'm sorry, Stephen.

1914
02:27:28,799 --> 02:27:31,051
<i>I hope you understand...</i>

1915
02:27:33,721 --> 02:27:35,431
<i>the greatest threat...</i>

1916
02:27:36,682 --> 02:27:38,058
<i>to our universe...</i>

1917
02:27:46,567 --> 02:27:47,776
<i>is you.</i>

1918
02:27:50,612 --> 02:27:53,240
Things just got out of hand.
