1
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:50,332
<i>Hello, you have reached...</i>

2
00:01:50,454 --> 00:01:51,822
<i>...the Ardor residence.</i>

3
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:53,413
<i>Please leave a message</i>

4
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:54,680
<i>after the tone.</i>

5
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,745
<i>Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad, it's Dani.</i>

6
00:02:00,112 --> 00:02:02,069
<i>Uh, I'm sorry to be calling so late.</i>

7
00:02:02,318 --> 00:02:04,788
<i>I'm just checking in.</i>

8
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:06,933
<i>Making sure everything's okay.</i>

9
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:10,964
<i>Listen, I got kind of
a scary e-mail from Terri</i>

10
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,632
<i>and she hasn't been responding.</i>

11
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:15,767
<i>Surprise, surprise.</i>

12
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:18,770
<i>But, uh, yeah,
it sounds like you guys</i>

13
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,528
<i>have been fighting
or something happened.</i>

14
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:24,561
<i>Anyway, uh, I just got
a little worried.</i>

15
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:26,403
<i>So, um, if you can call
when you can,</i>

16
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:29,047
<i>and of course, you know I'm...
I'm always here</i>

17
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:30,649
<i>if you need anything,</i>

18
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:32,218
<i>of course.</i>

19
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:38,322
Okay, um, I love you.
All right, bye.

20
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:51,053
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey sweetie.

21
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,245
What are you up to?

22
00:03:52,668 --> 00:03:56,504
<i>Um, just smoked
some resin with Mark</i>

23
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:57,729
<i>and now we're getting pizza.</i>

24
00:03:57,831 --> 00:03:59,332
Oh, nice.

25
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:01,711
<i>- Hi, Dani. Hi, Dani.
- Yeah, um...</i>

26
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:05,201
<i>He's saying "hi" right now,
over and over</i>

27
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,682
- Hi, Mark.
<i>- Hi, Mark.</i>

28
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:12,748
So, I was calling just to see if you...

29
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,410
You still wanted to hang out later?

30
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:21,699
<i>Did we talk about
doing something tonight?</i>

31
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:23,726
I mean, not...

32
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:25,954
not concretely,

33
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:30,071
<i>Um... Well... Okay..</i>

34
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:32,774
<i>Yeah, I should be able to swing by.</i>

35
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:34,943
- Cool..
<i>- Yeah, okay.</i>

36
00:04:39,188 --> 00:04:41,224
<i>How's the sister situation?</i>

37
00:04:51,177 --> 00:04:53,946
I e-mailed her three times

38
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:55,375
and still no response

39
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:58,335
so I'm getting a little bit nervous...

40
00:04:58,468 --> 00:05:01,103
<i>I'm sure it's fine.</i>

41
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:02,689
Yeah, probably...

42
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:04,306
<i>She does this every other day, Dani.</i>

43
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:06,266
<i>And only because you let her.</i>

44
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:08,277
Well, I don't let her,
she's bipolar, so...

45
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,981
<i>Yeah, I know.
But, you do though, babes.</i>

46
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:13,450
<i>You go straight to crisis mode.</i>

47
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,794
Well, she's my sister

48
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:19,330
and even you said that
this e-mail seemed different.

49
00:05:19,603 --> 00:05:21,672
<i>Yeah, right, but...</i>

50
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:24,483
<i>Is it though, really?</i>

51
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:27,196
<i>It's still just another
obvious ploy for attention</i>

52
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:29,966
<i>just like every other
panic attack she's given you.</i>

53
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:32,444
Yeah, you're right.

54
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:35,553
You are right, yeah, I know.

55
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,950
<i>I mean, the more you respond</i>

56
00:05:36,982 --> 00:05:38,518
<i> the more she's encouraged to keep... </i>

57
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:40,116
No, I know, I know, I know.
You're right, you're right.

58
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:42,417
I just... I just needed
to be reminded, thank you.

59
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:46,852
I'm very lucky to have you.

60
00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:49,407
<i>Yeah, well.</i>

61
00:05:49,873 --> 00:05:51,242
I love you.

62
00:05:52,456 --> 00:05:55,292
<i>I love you.</i>

63
00:05:58,262 --> 00:06:00,267
Okay, uh, I'll see you later?

64
00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:02,553
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Okay.

65
00:06:02,747 --> 00:06:04,648
- Bye, Mark.
<i>- Bye, Mark.</i>

66
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:07,456
Okay, I love you.

67
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:09,131
<i>- All right.</i>
- Bye.

68
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:14,235
It's in his tone, like,
you can hear it in his voice,

69
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,095
he's just working up the nerve
to say something.

70
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:17,928
<i>So be direct!
Confront him.</i>

71
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:19,550
What if I've scared him, though?

72
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:21,111
I'm always roping him
into my family crap.

73
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:22,286
<i>How do you rope him in?</i>

74
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,856
I'm always leaning on him!

75
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:25,316
Like, I even called him today in tears

76
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,676
because my sister wrote
another stupid scary e-mail.

77
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:30,228
<i>That's what he's there for.</i>

78
00:06:30,361 --> 00:06:33,231
What if I'm scaring him off?

79
00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:34,600
<i>What did your sister write?</i>

80
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:37,168
Just some ominous bullshit

81
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:39,103
like she always does and it's torture.

82
00:06:39,237 --> 00:06:41,105
And I lean on him
constantly for support.

83
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:43,574
Like, what if I have overwhelmed him

84
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,743
and he thinks that I just have
too much baggage?

85
00:06:45,877 --> 00:06:48,413
<i>Well, if that's the case,
then good riddance, right?</i>

86
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:52,250
No, not if I...
I went too far, if I leaned too much.

87
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:54,585
<i>You didn't! He should be there
when you need him.</i>

88
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,453
Yeah, but what if I need him too often

89
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:57,713
and it becomes a chore?

90
00:06:58,022 --> 00:07:00,091
<i>Then he's not the right guy.</i>

91
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:01,627
<i>Because it shouldn't ever be a chore.</i>

92
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,462
<i>Would it be a chore if he leaned on you?</i>

93
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:04,963
Yeah, but he doesn't ask me for anything.

94
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:06,122
I've never even seen him cry,

95
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:08,096
so I'm the only one that's leaning.

96
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:10,269
<i>Or the only one opening up.</i>

97
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:12,539
<i>The only one making yourself vulnerable.</i>

98
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:14,074
<i>- That's intimacy.</i>

99
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,900
Dude.

100
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,238
You have gotta get off the fence with this.

101
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:22,172
What if I regret it later

102
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:23,478
and I can't get her back?

103
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:25,972
- You don't want her back!
- But I might.

104
00:07:26,551 --> 00:07:28,152
Okay, well, then you can

105
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:30,846
bitch to us about how much
you regret it for that day

106
00:07:30,894 --> 00:07:32,462
and then we'll remind you again

107
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:34,063
that you've been wanting out
of this stupid relationship

108
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:35,638
for, like, a year now

109
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:38,080
and then you can find a chick
who actually likes sex

110
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:40,177
and doesn't drag you through
a million hoops every day.

111
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,583
Do you think there is
a masochistic part of you

112
00:07:42,684 --> 00:07:44,419
that is playing out
this particular drama

113
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:47,173
to avoid the work
you actually need to be doing?

114
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:51,478
What work do I need
to be doing, Josh, exactly?

115
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:53,646
Well, I dunno, your prospectus, maybe?

116
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,048
Your PhD...

117
00:07:55,094 --> 00:07:56,995
Wow, okay, thanks for the psychoanalysis.

118
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:58,383
It's not about academics, Josh.

119
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,726
I'm just trying to get you focused.

120
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,755
- Change?
- Um, that's for you.

121
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:07,761
See? You could be getting
that girl pregnant right now.

122
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:09,363
And don't forget about
all the Swedish women

123
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:10,866
you can impregnate in June.

124
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:12,232
- Okay, guys.
- Don't forget about

125
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:13,534
all the Swedish milkmaids.

126
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,418
That's not her again.

127
00:08:18,657 --> 00:08:19,923
Seriously?

128
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:22,395
Oh, my God.

129
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,123
- She needs a therapist, dude.
- She has a therapist.

130
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:26,948
Oh, so then she should call
her therapist and not you.

131
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:28,209
It's literally abuse.

132
00:08:28,318 --> 00:08:29,754
- She's abusing you.
- 'Scuse me.

133
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:31,715
- Nope.
- Oh, my God.

134
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:33,554
Okay, excuse me, guys.

135
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,155
- Well...
- Great.

136
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:44,387
- Hey.
<i>- No.</i>

137
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:48,715
- Dani, babe?
<i>- Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.</i>

138
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,016
No, no, no, no, no!

139
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,294
Hey, babe.

140
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:16,179
How you feeling?

141
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:24,606
I'm up.

142
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:29,888
Where you going?

143
00:13:30,357 --> 00:13:33,194
I was just gonna go
to that party for 45 minutes.

144
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:34,472
But, you just keep sleeping.

145
00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:35,264
No.

146
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:37,241
No, I'll come with you.

147
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,543
You sure you got enough sleep?

148
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:40,733
I wasn't sleeping anyway.

149
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:45,899
Yeah, I'm fucking dreading the summer.

150
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:47,352
Stuck in a shit-ass hole,

151
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:49,795
listening to my step-mom
fuck my dad all day.

152
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:52,413
I'll listen to your
step-mom fuck your dad.

153
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:54,682
Hey, Josh, you, uh, going to Europe?

154
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,382
Uh, yeah, yeah, for my thesis,

155
00:13:56,407 --> 00:13:58,610
you know, we all are.

156
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:01,056
Oh, you're all going?

157
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:04,225
Yeah, they're all coming
to visit my home in Halsingland.

158
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:05,659
Sweden.

159
00:14:05,793 --> 00:14:08,997
Oh, any occasion, or is it just for fun?

160
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:12,533
Uh, well, I'm... I'm doing my research.

161
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:14,404
These guys are just tagging along.

162
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:17,388
Mr. Pelle's invited us to

163
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:19,614
an authentic hippie midsummer
at his yodeling farm.

164
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:24,116
Oh, yeah?

165
00:14:25,817 --> 00:14:27,884
I mean, we were talking about it.

166
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:29,595
We were thinking about it.

167
00:14:31,498 --> 00:14:32,599
For when?

168
00:14:34,963 --> 00:14:36,564
Mid-June to mid-July.

169
00:14:36,737 --> 00:14:38,592
Yeah, two weeks from now?

170
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:40,057
Yeah.

171
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,708
I mean, that's if we even go.

172
00:14:42,974 --> 00:14:45,221
I'm probably not gonna go, but...

173
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,956
Yeah, we were talking about it.

174
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:29,174
You okay?

175
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:32,005
Mmm-hmm. Fine.

176
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,678
That was just really weird.

177
00:15:40,018 --> 00:15:41,319
What was?

178
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,015
The...

179
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:51,550
...Sweden.

180
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:55,201
I had no idea.

181
00:15:57,592 --> 00:15:58,694
Well, what do you mean?

182
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,751
'Cause I told you I wanted to go.

183
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:07,020
Okay, fine, but I didn't know
you were going.

184
00:16:09,357 --> 00:16:11,225
I just decided today.

185
00:16:12,615 --> 00:16:14,317
I wasn't keeping it from you.

186
00:16:14,443 --> 00:16:16,545
You already have a ticket.

187
00:16:19,924 --> 00:16:21,459
I'm sorry?

188
00:16:27,157 --> 00:16:29,360
Okay, well, just

189
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,292
imagine if you were at a party
and someone said,

190
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,493
"Hey, what're you doing for summer?"

191
00:16:34,548 --> 00:16:36,517
And then my friend said,

192
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:39,128
"Oh, we're going to China for three months"

193
00:16:39,153 --> 00:16:40,288
"and we're leaving in two weeks..."

194
00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:42,087
It's Sweden, for a month and a half.

195
00:16:42,112 --> 00:16:43,373
And it was the first
you'd ever heard of it.

196
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,396
Okay.

197
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:46,218
I told you I wanted to go to Sweden.

198
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,601
No, you said it would be cool to go.

199
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:50,241
Yeah, and then I got the opportunity

200
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:52,060
- and I decided to do it.
- Look, I don't mind you going.

201
00:16:52,263 --> 00:16:54,318
I just wish you would've told me,
that's all.

202
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:56,510
Well, I just apologized, Dani.

203
00:16:57,536 --> 00:16:59,438
You didn't apologize, you said sorry,

204
00:16:59,469 --> 00:17:01,438
which sounds more like, "Too bad."

205
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:07,634
Maybe I should just go home.

206
00:17:08,057 --> 00:17:09,759
What?
No, no..

207
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:12,473
I'm just trying to understand.

208
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,671
And I'm trying to apologize.

209
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,502
And I don't need an apology.

210
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:17,727
I don't, I just wanted to talk about it,
that's all.

211
00:17:21,116 --> 00:17:22,073
I really think I should just leave.

212
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:23,766
No, no, no, no.

213
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,747
Please, please, please.
I'm not... I'm not trying to attack you.

214
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:27,083
- It really feels like you are.
- I'm not.

215
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:28,518
Well, then...
Well, then I'm sorry.

216
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,820
I'm... I just got confused.
I'm sorry, I...

217
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:34,099
Hey, please, c'mon, can you come?

218
00:17:34,243 --> 00:17:35,178
- Just can you come and sit...
- Stop.

219
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:36,337
...with me, please?

220
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,769
Please, and we can talk about it.

221
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:41,803
Look, it just... It just felt
really weird, okay?

222
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:43,253
But I'm fine, I think it's great

223
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:45,114
that you're going to Sweden,
I do.

224
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,406
I think it's amazing.

225
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:50,471
Are you going for your thesis?

226
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,622
I don't know what my thesis is.

227
00:17:54,818 --> 00:17:57,554
I know and it...
It can... It will...

228
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,311
It can be inspiring, right?

229
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:03,143
Right?

230
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:05,938
Hey...

231
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,923
Please, I overreacted, I'm sorry.

232
00:18:10,813 --> 00:18:12,446
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:15,118
I know I get paranoid.

234
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,438
I don't mean to.

235
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:21,298
I know I overreacted, but I've been
trying to pull myself back up.

236
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:24,707
And I've been trying to deal with this panic and my fears...

237
00:18:25,245 --> 00:18:28,409
And I didn't mean to put pressure on you
or to blame you for anything.

238
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:31,402
- Okay
- I just got crazy for a second and I...

239
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:32,364
I'm sorry.

240
00:18:35,536 --> 00:18:36,716
It's fine.

241
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:42,009
- I am sorry.
- It's fine.

242
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:53,509
I was gonna ask you if you want come with me?

243
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:59,223
What?

244
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:05,623
What do you mean?

245
00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:07,194
What I just said.

246
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:08,889
To Sweden?

247
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,509
Hmhm.

248
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:17,173
You don't want me to go.

249
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:19,837
I just asked.

250
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:22,978
- Yeah, after I broke down crying.
- Well, you ruined the surprise.

251
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:29,071
I wanted it to be romantic.

252
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:42,227
In Stockholm, are there any,
like, meatball sex clubs

253
00:19:42,252 --> 00:19:44,555
we should hit up before we head north?

254
00:19:44,664 --> 00:19:46,333
No, we're going straight north.

255
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:49,483
Not straight, straight, though, right?

256
00:19:49,508 --> 00:19:50,410
We gotta go through Stockholm

257
00:19:50,435 --> 00:19:51,503
to get there.

258
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:52,840
No, it's the opposite direction.

259
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:54,975
Stockholm is south of Arlanda.

260
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:56,445
Guys, it's Dani.

261
00:19:56,577 --> 00:19:57,977
She's coming up.

262
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:00,915
Okay.

263
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:03,918
- Should we clear all this?
- No, it's fine.

264
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:14,861
Um, I invited Dani to come to Sweden.

265
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:17,044
So you guys know.

266
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:18,866
She's not actually gonna come,

267
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:21,668
but I invited her
just to not make it weird.

268
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:25,706
- You invited her to...
- Mmm-hmm.

269
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:28,042
But she's not coming.

270
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:30,879
She doesn't want to?

271
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:35,749
I invited her and she accepted,

272
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:38,785
but she's not actually coming to Sweden.

273
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:40,626
Okay.

274
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,228
Guys, you know what
she's been going through.

275
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:49,731
Yeah, no, dude, I just, uh,
thought it was...

276
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:51,267
Yeah, dude, nobody minds.

277
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,169
Thought you were saying
something else, that's all.

278
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:54,936
Okay, that's great.

279
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,641
And just so we're clear,
you guys told me to invite her

280
00:20:59,774 --> 00:21:00,943
and you all know that she's coming...

281
00:21:01,077 --> 00:21:02,310
Agreed?

282
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:03,613
Yep.

283
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:05,347
- Hey!
- Hey, babe!

284
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:07,749
Hey, guys.

285
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:09,650
- Hey.
- Yo.

286
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:11,219
How's it going?

287
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,089
We're chilling.

288
00:21:14,223 --> 00:21:15,358
Nice.

289
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:19,828
So, Sweden.

290
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:21,430
- Yeah.
- You're coming, right?

291
00:21:21,564 --> 00:21:23,499
I mean, I...

292
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:24,901
I guess so,

293
00:21:24,963 --> 00:21:26,864
if that's not completely
ruining you guys' plans.

294
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:29,204
- Oh, no, no.
- No, not at all.

295
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,877
Uh, Christian,
can I get you to take a look

296
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,741
at this paragraph real quick?

297
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:40,991
Uh, yeah, sure.

298
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,986
- I'll be back.
- Mmm-hmm.

299
00:21:49,193 --> 00:21:50,960
- Hey, Pelle.
- Hi.

300
00:21:59,536 --> 00:22:01,305
What were you drawing?

301
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:02,673
- Uh, just the table.
- Oh.

302
00:22:05,475 --> 00:22:06,443
How have you been?

303
00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:08,160
- Pretty good.
- Yeah?

304
00:22:08,222 --> 00:22:11,091
Survived finals, you know.

305
00:22:11,515 --> 00:22:14,016
- And you?
- Uh...

306
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,452
I didn't quite finish,

307
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:19,189
but they're giving me
a break this year.

308
00:22:19,323 --> 00:22:21,592
Oh, God, yes, yes,
of course. Sorry.

309
00:22:21,724 --> 00:22:22,874
It's, uh...

310
00:22:22,898 --> 00:22:24,801
How did you like
the Anthropology department?

311
00:22:25,562 --> 00:22:26,863
I like it, yeah.

312
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:28,999
Not as much as
this one maybe, but...

313
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:33,370
You're doing psychiatry, right?

314
00:22:33,503 --> 00:22:34,771
Uh, psychology, yeah.

315
00:22:34,905 --> 00:22:37,274
- Okay.
- That's how you know I'm nuts.

316
00:22:37,408 --> 00:22:39,576
Yeah, also that funny look in your eye.

317
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:43,313
So you're coming to Halsingland?

318
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:44,649
I guess so, yeah.

319
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:48,186
And, um, we'll actually be
arriving on my birthday.

320
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,788
- Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you!

321
00:22:50,922 --> 00:22:55,693
Yeah, Christian says you've
got this special week planned.

322
00:22:55,826 --> 00:22:57,242
Yeah, it's sort of a crazy

323
00:22:57,267 --> 00:22:59,250
nine-day festival my family's doing.

324
00:22:59,364 --> 00:23:01,300
- Lots of pageantry...
- Uh-huh.

325
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:03,377
...special ceremonies,
and dressing up.

326
00:23:03,402 --> 00:23:04,802
That sounds fun.

327
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:06,739
It'll probably seem very silly.

328
00:23:06,871 --> 00:23:09,107
But, it's like theater.

329
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,550
Yeah, Christian says you're...

330
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:13,311
You're from like a commune, right?

331
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:15,680
Yeah, we're...
We're a small community.

332
00:23:16,582 --> 00:23:18,483
Here. I'll show you.

333
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:25,356
Oh, wow.

334
00:23:25,623 --> 00:23:28,026
I see what you mean
about the pageantry.

335
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,394
Yeah, we make those clothes special

336
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:31,488
for every winter and summer solstice.

337
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,699
I mean, everybody sort of
does everything together.

338
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:36,301
That's an interesting symbol.

339
00:23:36,434 --> 00:23:39,705
Yeah, we're taught
the Runic alphabet, so...

340
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:42,006
Whoa, who's that one?

341
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,576
- That's last year's May Queen.
- Uh-huh.

342
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:46,733
Beautiful.

343
00:23:48,012 --> 00:23:50,816
You know, I'm very, very glad
you're coming.

344
00:23:52,351 --> 00:23:55,255
I... I think it's very good you're coming.

345
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:57,357
Thank you.

346
00:23:58,457 --> 00:23:59,958
Also, I...

347
00:24:00,092 --> 00:24:01,728
I never had the chance to tell you...

348
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,397
- Mmm.
- ...but I was...

349
00:24:04,531 --> 00:24:08,067
I was so very sorry
to hear about your loss.

350
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:11,538
- Oh.
- What happened, I mean,

351
00:24:11,671 --> 00:24:13,372
I can't even imagine.

352
00:24:13,872 --> 00:24:15,074
I mean...

353
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:16,740
- I lost my parents, too, so...
- Okay.

354
00:24:16,975 --> 00:24:18,511
I kind of have some idea.

355
00:24:18,645 --> 00:24:20,113
- I'm sorry.
- No!

356
00:24:20,246 --> 00:24:21,613
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, you're...

357
00:24:21,748 --> 00:24:24,183
I'm gonna just go
to the bathroom, thank you.

358
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:15,857
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

359
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:19,540
<i>we are beginning our initial
descent into Stockholm...</i>

360
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:31,385
Oh, my God, the women here.

361
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,421
What is it that makes them hotter?

362
00:25:33,554 --> 00:25:35,189
The Vikings grabbed all the best babes

363
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:38,484
from other countries
and dragged them over.

364
00:25:41,195 --> 00:25:42,663
How long is the drive?

365
00:25:42,797 --> 00:25:43,831
About four hours.

366
00:25:43,964 --> 00:25:45,966
Oh, my God.

367
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:49,160
I saw a video and it wasn't even like, it wasn't fake

368
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:52,168
and there was this one woman with three clits.

369
00:25:53,128 --> 00:25:54,476
Actually, for real .

370
00:25:54,551 --> 00:25:57,563
- Are you sensitive about Hiroshima?
- I am, actually.

371
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:03,263
Dude, what do you think?

372
00:26:03,288 --> 00:26:07,190
Imagine trying to take a dude seriously,
He's like reading out the news

373
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,600
And you know, he like, bludgeoned his wife with a pan.

374
00:26:48,604 --> 00:26:49,870
Why are you reading that?

375
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:53,386
Ask Pelle.

376
00:26:54,808 --> 00:26:59,067
We're taught the runic alphabet in my village.
Josh just carries that around to annoy me.

377
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:03,595
What are you doing your thesis on again?

378
00:27:03,845 --> 00:27:07,611
Uh, well, my focus is actually on European midsummer traditions.
Which was basically the impetus behind this whole trip that we're all on.

379
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:11,665
That's similar to what you're thinking of doing - right, baby?

380
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,358
For your thesis?

381
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:23,066
Well, I don't know what I'm doing it on yet as you know, but

382
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:27,282
I'm thinking about rooting in something Scandinavian.

383
00:27:28,181 --> 00:27:29,486
See that, Pelle?

384
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:32,235
You've managed to brainwash all of your friends.

385
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,420
Josh was already brainwashed when I found him.

386
00:28:49,037 --> 00:28:51,438
Okay, this is the first stop.

387
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:52,766
This is it?

388
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:54,947
Not quite, almost.

389
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:00,822
Pelle!

390
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,918
- Hey!
- Hey!

391
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:04,487
- Just beautiful.
- Oh, my God.

392
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,623
Hey, guys,
so these are younger people

393
00:29:05,648 --> 00:29:06,983
from my village.

394
00:29:07,023 --> 00:29:08,991
They're also returning
from their trips outside.

395
00:29:09,424 --> 00:29:10,726
Come on over.

396
00:29:12,296 --> 00:29:13,695
Hey!

397
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:15,998
These are my friends from America.

398
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:20,469
- Oh, dude.
- Hey.

399
00:29:20,603 --> 00:29:21,904
Just fucking walk.

400
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:23,371
Yeah, dude, there's so many bugs.

401
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:25,256
- It's beautiful, huh?
- Mmm.

402
00:29:31,763 --> 00:29:32,799
Okay, so this is, uh...

403
00:29:32,824 --> 00:29:34,192
- Mark, Dani...
- Hi.

404
00:29:34,217 --> 00:29:36,819
Christian and Josh.

405
00:29:36,954 --> 00:29:38,620
What?

406
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:41,394
Give me just one second.

407
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:42,959
You think he knows that guy?

408
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:44,300
He sounded mad.

409
00:29:54,937 --> 00:29:56,038
That must be good.

410
00:30:01,777 --> 00:30:04,013
Here! Come on over,
come on over.

411
00:30:04,146 --> 00:30:06,950
This is, uh, these are
my great friends from America.

412
00:30:07,194 --> 00:30:08,161
Christian, Dani,

413
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:09,518
- Josh, and Mark.
- Hi.

414
00:30:09,762 --> 00:30:11,263
Meet my brother, Ingemar.

415
00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:13,191
Uh, best friends since
we were babies, actually.

416
00:30:13,324 --> 00:30:14,491
Yeah.

417
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:17,694
So, Christian, Josh, Mark...

418
00:30:17,828 --> 00:30:19,029
- Dani? Yeah!
- Yeah!

419
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:21,131
Awesome! And say hello
to my friends.

420
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:22,666
This is Simon and Connie

421
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,302
- from London.
- How's it going?

422
00:30:24,434 --> 00:30:26,435
- Hi.
- Simon, this is Pelle...

423
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,605
And these are all the names

424
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:30,141
I just learned two seconds ago.

425
00:30:32,343 --> 00:30:33,577
Perfect timing, by the way,

426
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,381
We... We just took these
five minutes ago.

427
00:30:36,513 --> 00:30:38,548
Haven't even started coming up yet.

428
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:40,818
Oh, shit!

429
00:30:40,952 --> 00:30:43,754
Do you guys want take it now
or should we settle in first?

430
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:45,223
Fuck it, let's just take it now, right?

431
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,582
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Great.

432
00:30:47,191 --> 00:30:48,593
Uh, you know what,

433
00:30:48,726 --> 00:30:51,561
I might have to find
my footing first if that's okay.

434
00:30:51,695 --> 00:30:54,165
- Uh, yeah, of course.
- Yeah? Okay.

435
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:55,833
And listen, if you're feeling uneasy,

436
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:57,668
you don't have to take them at all.

437
00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:00,206
No. No, no, no. I just...
I want feel settled first.

438
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:01,805
- Okay.
- Okay.

439
00:31:03,115 --> 00:31:05,071
- I'll wait.
- No, no, you go ahead.

440
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:06,377
- No, I'll wait.
- Please.

441
00:31:06,502 --> 00:31:07,978
I want us to come up together.

442
00:31:08,112 --> 00:31:10,249
- Ready?
- Okay?

443
00:31:10,593 --> 00:31:13,329
Guys, I'm gonna wait for Dani,
so you just go ahead.

444
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,289
Dude, we can't take them
at different times,

445
00:31:17,423 --> 00:31:18,991
they'll be totally separate trips.

446
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:22,627
You want wait for us then?

447
00:31:28,877 --> 00:31:30,144
You know what,
it's fine, it's fine.

448
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:31,736
- Babe... Babe, no.
- I'm ready.

449
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:33,180
- No, it's okay,
- Don't feel rushed.

450
00:31:33,272 --> 00:31:35,107
I don't, I don't.
It's fine, I'm ready.

451
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:38,009
Are you sure?

452
00:31:39,744 --> 00:31:41,814
Yes, Mark, thank you.

453
00:31:41,947 --> 00:31:43,615
- They've made mushroom tea.
- Mmm-hmm.

454
00:31:43,749 --> 00:31:45,150
If you prefer against the taste.

455
00:31:45,285 --> 00:31:47,618
Uh, yeah, okay,
I'll try that, thank you.

456
00:31:47,814 --> 00:31:49,150
- Ingemar? Ingemar?
- Ingemar.

457
00:31:49,221 --> 00:31:51,123
- Ingemar, okay. Thank you.
- Perfect.

458
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:53,933
Don't let Mark be the one

459
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:55,094
- to pressure you.
- He's not.

460
00:31:55,227 --> 00:31:57,029
- Of all people.
- He's not, he's not.

461
00:31:57,162 --> 00:31:58,465
It will... It will get
complicated otherwise, it's fine.

462
00:31:58,597 --> 00:32:00,165
- Are you ready?
- Yes, thank you.

463
00:32:00,198 --> 00:32:01,597
- There you go.
- Ooh.

464
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:02,868
Thanks, dude.

465
00:32:03,002 --> 00:32:04,670
Okay, here we go then.

466
00:32:04,803 --> 00:32:06,160
- Think happy thoughts!
- Are you sure about this?

467
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:08,394
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm excited.
- Cheers!

468
00:32:10,242 --> 00:32:12,177
- All right.
- Yeah?

469
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:13,613
Are you sure about this?

470
00:32:13,747 --> 00:32:15,715
I think it's gonna be fun.

471
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:17,884
- We're in?
- Yep, go.

472
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:24,643
What time is it?

473
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:27,827
It's 9:00 p.m.

474
00:32:29,763 --> 00:32:31,165
What do you mean?

475
00:32:32,766 --> 00:32:34,200
What do you mean?

476
00:32:35,534 --> 00:32:37,704
That can't be right!
The sky is blue!

477
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,859
It's fine, it's Sweden.

478
00:32:40,908 --> 00:32:43,843
That's not fine!
Why is it like that?

479
00:32:43,977 --> 00:32:46,780
It's okay, Mark.
It's the midnight sun.

480
00:32:46,913 --> 00:32:49,116
That feels wrong,
I don't like that!

481
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:51,351
I promise you, it's okay.

482
00:32:51,485 --> 00:32:52,719
I'm not okay.

483
00:32:52,852 --> 00:32:54,522
Oh, fuck, it's a new person.

484
00:32:54,654 --> 00:32:55,755
What?

485
00:32:55,889 --> 00:32:58,158
I don't want new people right now.

486
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:01,094
No, new people are good, Mark.

487
00:33:02,229 --> 00:33:03,563
Hi, hi!

488
00:33:06,842 --> 00:33:07,976
I'm just gonna lay down, okay?

489
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:09,403
Yeah, do that.

490
00:33:09,677 --> 00:33:11,744
Everybody else lay down.

491
00:33:14,674 --> 00:33:16,811
Guys, do it, it feels so nice.

492
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:21,882
Josh, can you lie down, please?

493
00:33:23,617 --> 00:33:25,253
Can you feel that?

494
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:27,222
The energy.

495
00:33:27,613 --> 00:33:28,790
Coming up from the earth.

496
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:44,574
Look!

497
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:47,108
The trees too, they're breathing.

498
00:33:54,057 --> 00:33:56,493
Nature just knows instinctively

499
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:58,353
how to stay in harmony.

500
00:34:00,986 --> 00:34:04,059
Everything just mechanically
doing its part.

501
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,835
You guys are like my family.

502
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:19,408
You're like my real, actual family.

503
00:34:21,377 --> 00:34:22,845
Dani?

504
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:26,882
Sorry.

505
00:34:27,016 --> 00:34:30,086
Uh, I'm gonna go for a walk.

506
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:31,854
I can walk, too.

507
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:34,624
No, I'm good.

508
00:34:37,126 --> 00:34:38,995
No, no, no, no.

509
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,464
Don't think that.
You're fine.

510
00:34:41,597 --> 00:34:42,999
It's almost your birthday.

511
00:34:43,132 --> 00:34:46,637
You're okay, you're fine.
You're fine.

512
00:34:56,078 --> 00:34:58,713
Stop it!
I'm fine.

513
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:00,449
Hey, Dani!

514
00:35:03,253 --> 00:35:04,454
How are you?

515
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:07,423
They were laughing at me.

516
00:35:07,557 --> 00:35:10,760
What? No, no, no,
I'm sure they weren't.

517
00:35:11,562 --> 00:35:13,096
They've been laughing.

518
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:15,865
Want to come meet my friends?

519
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:22,372
Thank you.
I'm sorry, thank you.

520
00:35:27,978 --> 00:35:32,049
Stop it!
Stop it, fuck!

521
00:35:35,453 --> 00:35:38,922
You're okay, you're okay,
you're okay.

522
00:36:14,748 --> 00:36:16,151
Hey.

523
00:36:23,663 --> 00:36:25,398
How long was I asleep?

524
00:36:27,171 --> 00:36:28,540
I mean,

525
00:36:28,674 --> 00:36:31,143
we found you here,
like, six hours ago.

526
00:36:37,317 --> 00:36:39,185
Did it get dark at all?

527
00:36:41,453 --> 00:36:44,323
For a couple of hours, not completely.

528
00:36:46,058 --> 00:36:48,294
Is it tomorrow?

529
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:51,477
I mean, from yesterday's perspective.

530
00:36:55,702 --> 00:36:57,135
Come on.

531
00:37:00,272 --> 00:37:01,940
Where are we going?

532
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:03,277
What we came for.

533
00:37:42,483 --> 00:37:44,485
Jesus, Pelle, where are you taking us?

534
00:37:44,618 --> 00:37:47,087
Yeah, this is way the hell out there.

535
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,493
Do they have ticks in Sweden?

536
00:37:53,626 --> 00:37:55,528
Sweden has a tick problem.

537
00:37:55,929 --> 00:37:56,930
What?

538
00:37:57,172 --> 00:37:58,307
No they don't, do they really?

539
00:37:58,332 --> 00:37:59,866
Actually, it is a big problem.

540
00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:01,701
Last summer, a record number of people

541
00:38:01,835 --> 00:38:03,470
got tick-borne encephalitis.

542
00:38:03,603 --> 00:38:05,872
What the fuck?
Are you serious?

543
00:38:06,005 --> 00:38:08,041
Both my grandparents died from ticks.

544
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,851
Had to give them a closed casket funeral.

545
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:13,748
Okay, Josh, I actually
have an uncle with Lyme.

546
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,424
And believe me,
if you ask him,

547
00:38:15,449 --> 00:38:17,650
it was not worth the
pleasant picnic in the park.

548
00:38:17,785 --> 00:38:18,952
He's fucked.

549
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:03,999
So, this is the place.

550
00:39:04,132 --> 00:39:07,067
The tranquil and majestic Hårga.

551
00:39:09,492 --> 00:39:11,695
Pelle, you know all these people?

552
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,466
These are my family!

553
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,070
- Thank you.
- What is it? Strawberry?

554
00:39:39,095 --> 00:39:40,770
- Thank you.
- Oh, thanks.

555
00:39:40,903 --> 00:39:42,205
Bag?

556
00:39:42,873 --> 00:39:44,508
Thank you, sorry.

557
00:39:45,974 --> 00:39:47,610
Hey guys,

558
00:39:47,743 --> 00:39:49,045
meet my sister, Dagny.

559
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,914
Born on the exact same day as me.

560
00:39:51,047 --> 00:39:54,115
- Hi.
- Dani, Josh, Mark, Christian.

561
00:39:56,652 --> 00:39:58,387
<i>- Thanks.</i>
- Thank you.

562
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,289
<i>- Thanks.</i>
- Hi.

563
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:13,436
- Father Odd!
- Little Pelle!

564
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:33,661
Sorry, these are my friends

565
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:36,410
Christian, Dani, Josh, Mark.

566
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,095
- Hello.
- Hi.

567
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,431
Welcome.

568
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:43,400
- Hi.
- Welcome home.

569
00:40:44,268 --> 00:40:47,170
We are so very happy to have you!

570
00:40:47,273 --> 00:40:48,574
Ah, thank you.

571
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,142
Pelle has an immaculate sense for people.

572
00:40:53,343 --> 00:40:54,946
I love what you're wearing.

573
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,014
My frock?

574
00:40:56,147 --> 00:40:57,514
Quite girly, ha?

575
00:40:58,502 --> 00:41:01,204
We do these as a tribute
in respect of Ymir

576
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:03,707
and because of the nature's

577
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:08,660
hermaphrodite, I think, qualities.
Yeah.

578
00:41:08,793 --> 00:41:11,863
Wow, I think the Sakhis saints
do the same thing

579
00:41:11,997 --> 00:41:13,798
in Brajbhoomi?

580
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:16,434
So, we are your hosts.

581
00:41:16,678 --> 00:41:18,278
So whatever you need, just say so

582
00:41:18,303 --> 00:41:20,005
and we will accommodate, okay?

583
00:41:20,138 --> 00:41:21,471
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

584
00:41:21,714 --> 00:41:23,282
Today is all festivities.

585
00:41:23,307 --> 00:41:26,076
Um, just tomorrow,
the official ceremony begin

586
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:27,787
and you are welcome!

587
00:41:27,812 --> 00:41:30,080
- Welcome, welcome, welcome.
- Thank you.

588
00:41:30,213 --> 00:41:32,016
Yeah.
Enjoy.

589
00:41:32,149 --> 00:41:34,285
Just... Thank you.

590
00:41:35,888 --> 00:41:37,755
That guy has a very red face.

591
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,857
Yeah.

592
00:41:42,361 --> 00:41:44,731
- Do we eat these?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

593
00:42:49,996 --> 00:42:53,542
- Can I take photos?
- Um... Discreetly.

594
00:42:56,836 --> 00:42:57,904
Thanks.

595
00:42:58,738 --> 00:43:00,340
Oh, forgive me.

596
00:43:00,473 --> 00:43:03,343
I'm excluding the ones
who aren't of Swedish tongue.

597
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,579
Welcome to Hårga,

598
00:43:07,247 --> 00:43:08,682
and happy midsummer!

599
00:43:08,816 --> 00:43:12,586
It has been 90 years
since our last great feast

600
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:15,923
and it will be 90 years before our next.

601
00:43:16,057 --> 00:43:18,659
And what poetry
that it's now the hottest

602
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:21,365
and brightest summer on record.

603
00:43:21,623 --> 00:43:24,593
We already have so much to give back

604
00:43:24,665 --> 00:43:27,233
and so, without any further blathering,

605
00:43:27,368 --> 00:43:29,569
let's raise our glasses.

606
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:35,543
- Let our Nine-Day Feast commence.
- Cheers!

607
00:44:38,403 --> 00:44:40,301
That fire hasn't burned out since I was born.

608
00:44:40,399 --> 00:44:42,813
It's all of our jobs to keep it going.

609
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,157
Wait, what did you say?

610
00:44:45,837 --> 00:44:47,548
I'll tell you later.

611
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,418
He's giving thanks.

612
00:46:18,598 --> 00:46:21,700
- For the food?
- Yeah, and the weather, the crops.

613
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:10,487
Was that praying?

614
00:47:11,252 --> 00:47:15,909
Eh, maybe not praying,
but he was just addressing the...

615
00:47:16,169 --> 00:47:18,231
harmony and the balance.

616
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:22,614
Can I get a translation of what was sang?

617
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:25,481
Yeah, I can get a translation from him later.

618
00:47:26,637 --> 00:47:29,137
Yeah, thanks, that'd be amazing.

619
00:47:29,606 --> 00:47:30,958
Sure.

620
00:47:31,426 --> 00:47:32,645
Yes, thank you, Pelle.

621
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:34,981
Of course.

622
00:48:24,796 --> 00:48:26,933
You guys should join.

623
00:48:27,268 --> 00:48:30,506
Oh, no, I'm too scared.

624
00:48:36,476 --> 00:48:39,044
- All right.
- Oh, thanks, babe.

625
00:48:41,948 --> 00:48:43,448
What are the kids playing?

626
00:48:43,883 --> 00:48:45,351
Skin the fool.

627
00:48:45,485 --> 00:48:48,053
- Skin the fool?
- Yeah.

628
00:48:48,687 --> 00:48:50,021
Precious.

629
00:49:09,003 --> 00:49:11,139
Hey, Pelle, can anybody just join in?

630
00:49:11,272 --> 00:49:14,676
You're an American,
just jam yourself in there.

631
00:49:15,043 --> 00:49:16,177
All right.

632
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:20,011
Hey.

633
00:49:21,282 --> 00:49:23,051
Happy birthday.

634
00:49:25,819 --> 00:49:27,922
Oh, my gosh, Pelle.

635
00:49:28,056 --> 00:49:30,625
Just something I do for birthdays.

636
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,127
Maybe it's not appropriate?

637
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,756
No, no, no, no, not at all.
Thank you so much.

638
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:38,099
It's beautiful.

639
00:49:38,233 --> 00:49:40,168
Anyway, just between us.

640
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:43,204
Yeah, well...

641
00:49:43,338 --> 00:49:46,608
Christian forgot anyway,
so this is amazing. Thank you.

642
00:49:48,742 --> 00:49:50,945
No. No, no, no,
I forgot to remind him

643
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:53,281
and it's not his fault, it's...

644
00:49:54,618 --> 00:49:55,587
Never mind, it's okay.

645
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,152
This is beautiful.

646
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,821
Thank you so much,
I'm really touched.

647
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,025
So, how do you support this place?

648
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,594
Lumbering, linen, homeopathics...

649
00:50:06,728 --> 00:50:08,097
Water power plant.

650
00:50:09,999 --> 00:50:11,700
School time over here.

651
00:50:12,667 --> 00:50:13,802
Carving runes?

652
00:50:14,334 --> 00:50:15,535
Really?

653
00:50:16,672 --> 00:50:19,642
They put it under their pillow
and dream about its powers.

654
00:50:22,378 --> 00:50:24,246
Oh, fuck.
There's a big one.

655
00:50:24,278 --> 00:50:25,913
Oh, shit.

656
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,950
What alphabet is that from?

657
00:50:28,485 --> 00:50:31,153
Uh, the Younger Futhark.

658
00:50:31,287 --> 00:50:33,022
I... I think?
Or is that medieval?

659
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:35,758
Actually, that is the Elder Futhark.

660
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:38,626
So, how long have you two
been together?

661
00:50:38,761 --> 00:50:40,863
- Oh, geez, um...
- Um...

662
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,898
Just over three and a half years.

663
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:44,833
Four years.

664
00:50:44,967 --> 00:50:47,436
- Serius ?
- Ya.

665
00:50:47,571 --> 00:50:49,105
- No? Really?
- Yeah.

666
00:50:50,773 --> 00:50:51,975
You're right, I'm sorry.

667
00:50:52,109 --> 00:50:54,276
- You're right. Four years.
- Mmm-hmm.

668
00:50:56,312 --> 00:50:59,782
Yeah, um, how did you guys all meet?

669
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:04,720
Well, we were all working on the same farm

670
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:07,656
and funny enough,
I was dating Connie

671
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:10,026
when Simon and me first became pals.

672
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,330
Well, we'd been on a date.

673
00:51:12,463 --> 00:51:14,664
And I didn't even actually know
it was a date, so...

674
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:16,167
You're right.
No, no.

675
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,701
I meant that Connie and me
had just become friends.

676
00:51:17,834 --> 00:51:19,669
We... We decided to be friends.

677
00:51:19,803 --> 00:51:21,139
And that was just before

678
00:51:21,225 --> 00:51:23,427
Connie and Simon started dating.

679
00:51:23,608 --> 00:51:25,142
And now they're engaged.

680
00:51:25,275 --> 00:51:27,744
- What? Congratulations!
- Wow.

681
00:51:27,878 --> 00:51:29,746
Which is amazing,
yes, congratulations.

682
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,716
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah, we actually asked Ingemar

683
00:51:32,849 --> 00:51:34,251
to officiate the wedding.

684
00:51:34,385 --> 00:51:35,919
- Really?
- Nah.

685
00:51:36,052 --> 00:51:38,156
- Oh.
- What's that building over there?

686
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,891
It's like a sacred temple,

687
00:51:41,024 --> 00:51:43,059
but no one's allowed in there.

688
00:51:44,295 --> 00:51:46,696
Uh, let me show you where we sleep.

689
00:51:46,831 --> 00:51:50,200
Let me show you the <i>Rotvälta!</i>

690
00:51:50,334 --> 00:51:52,503
So we're just gonna ignore the bear then?

691
00:51:53,137 --> 00:51:54,739
It's a bear.

692
00:51:59,776 --> 00:52:01,045
What's that?

693
00:52:02,113 --> 00:52:04,148
- We can check it out.
- Yeah.

694
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:14,859
Love story.

695
00:52:52,531 --> 00:52:56,235
Oh, wow.
What? Wow.

696
00:53:06,512 --> 00:53:09,615
Wow.

697
00:53:09,747 --> 00:53:13,018
It's like in the Scripture.

698
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:18,324
What do you think?

699
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:21,495
It's like another world.

700
00:53:22,529 --> 00:53:24,098
Amazing.

701
00:53:24,231 --> 00:53:25,698
People just sleep here?

702
00:53:25,832 --> 00:53:26,799
Yeah, all the younger ones

703
00:53:26,933 --> 00:53:28,101
until we turn 36

704
00:53:28,234 --> 00:53:29,769
and then we move
to the laborers house.

705
00:53:29,902 --> 00:53:31,171
Why 36?

706
00:53:31,305 --> 00:53:33,473
Well, we think of life like the seasons.

707
00:53:33,606 --> 00:53:36,342
So you're a child
until you're 18 and that's Spring.

708
00:53:36,477 --> 00:53:38,579
And then at some point,
we all do our Pilgrimage

709
00:53:38,712 --> 00:53:40,381
which is between 18 and 36.

710
00:53:40,513 --> 00:53:44,851
That's Summer,
and then from 36 to 54,

711
00:53:44,984 --> 00:53:47,354
we're working age,
which is Fall.

712
00:53:47,488 --> 00:53:51,124
And then finally from 54 to 72
you become a mentor.

713
00:53:53,126 --> 00:53:54,561
What happens at 72?

714
00:53:58,732 --> 00:54:00,199
Not a lot of privacy.

715
00:54:00,334 --> 00:54:02,202
Yeah, what do you do
when you need to jerk off?

716
00:54:02,336 --> 00:54:03,837
Especially with all these
dicks on the wall.

717
00:54:03,971 --> 00:54:05,051
There's a lot of dicks.

718
00:54:23,149 --> 00:54:24,446
It's Dani's birthday today.

719
00:54:24,672 --> 00:54:26,321
Oh, fuck.

720
00:54:28,589 --> 00:54:29,791
Did she say something?

721
00:54:29,923 --> 00:54:31,259
No, no, no, absolutely not.

722
00:54:31,392 --> 00:54:33,861
I just wanted to
let you know before, so...

723
00:54:33,995 --> 00:54:35,529
Are these the May Queens?

724
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,469
Yeah.

725
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:40,668
Right. Uh, you'll actually
be here for that.

726
00:54:41,402 --> 00:54:43,671
And who are your May Queens?

727
00:54:43,805 --> 00:54:46,507
Uh, every mid-summer,
we have this dance competition

728
00:54:46,641 --> 00:54:48,309
and the winner gets crowned and this is...

729
00:54:48,977 --> 00:54:51,112
- Oh, wow.
- Hey!

730
00:55:01,176 --> 00:55:02,277
Was that...

731
00:55:03,385 --> 00:55:04,853
You saw that too, right?

732
00:55:06,957 --> 00:55:08,292
Pelle, who was that?

733
00:55:08,448 --> 00:55:09,983
Inge.

734
00:55:10,172 --> 00:55:12,274
Oh, my God, I want to give her a bath.

735
00:55:12,533 --> 00:55:15,369
Hey, can I pull you outside for a sec?

736
00:55:15,975 --> 00:55:17,511
Yeah, sure.

737
00:55:20,164 --> 00:55:22,201
Pelle, tell her to come back.

738
00:55:31,284 --> 00:55:34,053
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

739
00:55:34,186 --> 00:55:35,287
What?

740
00:55:36,027 --> 00:55:39,964
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

741
00:55:40,262 --> 00:55:45,134
<i>Happy birthday, dear Dani</i>

742
00:55:45,196 --> 00:55:48,599
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

743
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,072
Fuck.

744
00:55:51,741 --> 00:55:53,576
- Stop, it's fine.
- What?

745
00:55:54,644 --> 00:55:56,979
You didn't think I forgot, did you?

746
00:55:59,238 --> 00:56:00,374
I'm sorry.

747
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,352
I'm sorry I got fucked up
by the daylight

748
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:03,852
and I thought it was yesterday.

749
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,220
- It's okay. It's fine.
- Happy birthday.

750
00:56:05,354 --> 00:56:06,422
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you. I'm not upset.

751
00:56:06,555 --> 00:56:07,489
It's okay.

752
00:56:07,624 --> 00:56:09,559
- You should be.
- I... I should be.

753
00:56:10,015 --> 00:56:11,383
I'm sorry.

754
00:56:36,469 --> 00:56:38,372
All right, beauty rest.

755
00:56:39,387 --> 00:56:40,922
Tomorrow's a big day.

756
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:44,120
What's tomorrow?

757
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:46,262
First of the big ceremonies.

758
00:56:50,826 --> 00:56:52,494
<i>Attestupan.</i>

759
00:56:54,012 --> 00:56:55,180
What's that?

760
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,008
Uh, it's too hard to explain,

761
00:56:57,408 --> 00:56:59,442
you'll get a better sense tomorrow.

762
00:56:59,576 --> 00:57:03,079
- Wait, seriously?
- You can't just tell me now?

763
00:57:05,094 --> 00:57:07,796
Wait, you're not talking
about an actual one?

764
00:57:08,117 --> 00:57:10,320
I mean, it's pretty actual.

765
00:57:10,454 --> 00:57:11,522
Fuck.

766
00:57:13,361 --> 00:57:15,029
Do you know what it is?

767
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:19,303
Dude!

768
00:57:21,345 --> 00:57:23,013
Is it scary?

769
00:57:26,094 --> 00:57:27,830
That is so fucking annoying.

770
00:57:29,026 --> 00:57:30,961
Yo! Check my scalp for ticks,

771
00:57:30,986 --> 00:57:32,053
then I'll check yours.

772
00:59:11,825 --> 00:59:12,958
Somebody should tell those girls

773
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:14,383
they're walking stupid.

774
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,670
How long do they typically stand?

775
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:27,723
We're going to stand
until it's right to sit.

776
00:59:30,757 --> 00:59:33,126
Hey. Oh.

777
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:35,544
- Are these for me?
- Mmm-hmm.

778
00:59:36,335 --> 00:59:38,337
- You pick 'em backwards?
- Yeah.

779
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:44,018
Are those the ones?

780
01:00:44,205 --> 01:00:45,540
Yeah.

781
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,155
Dude, I'm so hungry.

782
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,316
It's like they're trying to make it gross.

783
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:38,329
Dude, it's the girl from earlier staring at me again.

784
01:01:43,637 --> 01:01:45,457
- See that?
- Yeah.

785
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,708
Her... Her mother is on Pilgrimage.

786
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,911
- Oh...
- Helps her to detach.

787
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:55,746
Okay.

788
01:01:55,771 --> 01:01:57,538
The babies are raised here by everyone.

789
01:01:58,277 --> 01:02:00,411
Wow. You want this?

790
01:03:09,098 --> 01:03:12,169
What do you think the guy's reaction would be
if I'd just put my finger in his butt right now?

791
01:05:05,803 --> 01:05:07,539
Dude, are you following them out?

792
01:05:07,672 --> 01:05:09,174
I'm beat.
I'm gonna go take a nap.

793
01:05:09,308 --> 01:05:11,844
- Okay, okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

794
01:05:11,947 --> 01:05:14,782
Wait, what're we doing now?

795
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:14,773
What is that book?

796
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:18,038
Our scripture.

797
01:07:20,509 --> 01:07:22,546
Can I read that?

798
01:07:22,593 --> 01:07:24,029
You would not be able.

799
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:18,547
Oh, my God!

800
01:10:21,982 --> 01:10:23,017
It's fine.

801
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:24,653
Did she jump?

802
01:10:24,786 --> 01:10:25,886
What the...

803
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:27,188
It's part of the ceremony.

804
01:10:27,321 --> 01:10:28,497
What?
No, she fell, she fell.

805
01:10:28,522 --> 01:10:29,725
Fuck!

806
01:10:29,857 --> 01:10:31,892
- She fell, right?
- Did she jump?

807
01:10:32,026 --> 01:10:33,261
It's okay.

808
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,196
Oh, my...
Did she fall or did she jump?

809
01:10:35,329 --> 01:10:37,699
It's okay, it's fine.
Don't worry.

810
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,066
What do you mean it's fine?

811
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,968
She's fucking dead.
Look at her head!

812
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:42,737
Look at her head, she's dead!

813
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:44,480
It's a part of the ceremony.

814
01:10:44,505 --> 01:10:45,807
Why the fuck are you
standing there like that?

815
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:48,143
She just fucking jumped off the cliff.

816
01:10:48,168 --> 01:10:51,879
Are you freaking blind?
What the... Fuck!

817
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:56,985
Oh, my God.

818
01:10:58,104 --> 01:10:59,505
What the fuck?

819
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:13,136
No, he's doing...
He's doing the same thing.

820
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:15,370
He's doing the same fucking thing!

821
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,776
Someone stop!
Sir, don't do it.

822
01:11:19,909 --> 01:11:21,344
Tell him to stop.

823
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:23,846
Why's everyone just standing there,
what the fuck?

824
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:27,016
Sir, don't... don't jump, don't jump!

825
01:11:27,134 --> 01:11:28,668
Please, someone tell him not to jump.

826
01:11:28,819 --> 01:11:30,119
- What the fuck?
- Someone tell him...

827
01:11:57,077 --> 01:11:59,311
- He's still alive.
- What's going on?

828
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,290
Fuck, we're going.

829
01:13:07,582 --> 01:13:10,384
Fuck! This is fucked!

830
01:13:10,517 --> 01:13:12,821
Fuck this!
You're fucked!

831
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:14,824
Fuck! You're all just fucking
standing there watching,

832
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:17,391
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Ingemar! Did you not warn them?

833
01:13:17,415 --> 01:13:19,293
I'm sorry, grandmother Siv!
I tried to!

834
01:13:19,326 --> 01:13:21,263
- Please! Please!
- No, fucking leave her alone!

835
01:13:21,396 --> 01:13:23,098
Please, listen to me.
Let me explain!

836
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,466
What?
Explain what?

837
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,534
- Please, my poor thing.
- Fucked!

838
01:13:26,574 --> 01:13:28,442
Please!
What you just saw

839
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:31,640
is a long, long, long observed custom.

840
01:13:31,665 --> 01:13:33,333
- "Custom!" It's fucked!
- Yes.

841
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,911
Those two who jumped
have just reached

842
01:13:36,045 --> 01:13:38,647
the end of their Hårga life-cycle.

843
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:42,417
And you need to understand it
as a great joy for them.

844
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:45,154
- "Joy?"
- Yes, and when it is my turn,

845
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:47,523
it will be a great joy for me.

846
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:50,125
- Fuck.
- We view life as a circle,

847
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,759
a recycle.

848
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:55,064
The lady who jumped,
her name was Ylva, yes?

849
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:58,267
And that baby over there
who is not yet born

850
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:00,368
will inherit that name.

851
01:14:00,501 --> 01:14:01,837
Instead of getting old

852
01:14:01,971 --> 01:14:05,242
and dying in pain and fear and shame,

853
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:07,542
we give our life.

854
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,478
As a gesture.

855
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:12,047
- A gesture?
- Before it can spoil.

856
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,449
It does no good dying,

857
01:14:14,582 --> 01:14:16,953
lashing back at the inevitable.

858
01:14:17,087 --> 01:14:19,556
It corrupts the spirit.

859
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:22,959
I'm so sorry
I didn't warn you better.

860
01:14:27,697 --> 01:14:29,033
You feeling okay?

861
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:32,969
I just really need to not be here
right now.

862
01:14:33,103 --> 01:14:34,104
Yeah.

863
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:40,911
I'm gonna go.

864
01:14:41,044 --> 01:14:42,946
Just take some time to yourself, okay.

865
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:48,478
What's up, man?

866
01:15:53,345 --> 01:15:55,486
Are you getting reception here?

867
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:01,759
Eh, I'll talk to you in just a minute.

868
01:16:09,369 --> 01:16:10,971
- Hey, dude...
- Hey!

869
01:16:12,321 --> 01:16:13,754
Holy shit, right?

870
01:16:14,642 --> 01:16:16,010
Are you okay?

871
01:16:16,754 --> 01:16:18,123
Yeah, I'm fine.

872
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:19,926
Good.

873
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:27,088
Hey, listen. Um...

874
01:16:28,096 --> 01:16:29,498
I've been thinking about something

875
01:16:29,523 --> 01:16:30,958
that I wanted to ask you.

876
01:16:31,209 --> 01:16:33,511
Or tell you, actually.

877
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:42,103
I've been thinking a lot about my thesis.

878
01:16:42,237 --> 01:16:44,072
And, um...

879
01:16:44,206 --> 01:16:47,541
I've decided I'm gonna do it here.
On Hårga.

880
01:16:48,952 --> 01:16:50,386
And I wanted to tell you first.

881
01:16:50,411 --> 01:16:53,981
Just so it didn't seem like
I wasn't telling you.

882
01:16:56,995 --> 01:16:59,998
I feel like... I feel like
I can't tell if you're joking.

883
01:17:04,533 --> 01:17:05,969
I mean... I mean, you know

884
01:17:05,994 --> 01:17:08,222
I'm doing my thesis on midsummer.
That's the reason

885
01:17:08,247 --> 01:17:09,886
why I'm here.
- Yeah.

886
01:17:11,766 --> 01:17:14,135
Yeah, but not on this community.

887
01:17:14,269 --> 01:17:17,106
I mean, you're going
to Germany and England next.

888
01:17:19,162 --> 01:17:21,866
Well, you knew I was gonna want do this.

889
01:17:23,584 --> 01:17:25,455
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, my God.

890
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,283
I mean, did you even know
until just now?

891
01:17:27,421 --> 01:17:28,517
Christian, of course you did!

892
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:30,179
Okay, do you think I don't know

893
01:17:30,219 --> 01:17:31,888
what you're doing?

894
01:17:32,130 --> 01:17:34,631
It's actually kind of
outrageously unsubtle.

895
01:17:34,656 --> 01:17:37,624
The fact that you're being
this bald about it.

896
01:17:37,911 --> 01:17:40,529
I'm... I'm honestly kind of impressed.

897
01:17:40,771 --> 01:17:42,039
What the fuck, man?

898
01:17:42,064 --> 01:17:43,398
What does that mean?

899
01:17:43,531 --> 01:17:45,835
I've been working toward
and you know it.

900
01:17:45,968 --> 01:17:47,937
That's why you look so guilty right now,
because you know.

901
01:17:48,071 --> 01:17:49,471
You know that what you're doing

902
01:17:49,604 --> 01:17:51,816
is unethical and leechy and lazy.

903
01:17:52,309 --> 01:17:54,577
And, frankly, it's kind of sad.

904
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:57,114
- Fuck you!
- No, dude, not fuck me!

905
01:17:57,247 --> 01:17:58,748
Find your own subject.

906
01:17:58,881 --> 01:18:00,283
Or... Or your own passion.

907
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:01,984
Look...

908
01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:05,617
I am... I'm actually invested in this.

909
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:08,197
This is not some glorified hobby

910
01:18:08,222 --> 01:18:10,624
that I'm casually dipping my feet into.

911
01:18:12,602 --> 01:18:16,501
In case you didn't notice, your highness,
We're doing the same degree.

912
01:18:16,532 --> 01:18:18,657
But not in the same way, Christian!

913
01:18:19,087 --> 01:18:22,884
I have to hold your little hand through everything.

914
01:18:23,693 --> 01:18:26,638
You didn't even know how to use JSTOR until I taught you.

915
01:18:26,685 --> 01:18:28,788
And you're a fucking grad student.

916
01:18:28,944 --> 01:18:30,905
Why are you even in academia?

917
01:18:31,225 --> 01:18:32,537
You don't care!

918
01:18:32,562 --> 01:18:34,343
Which is fine. That is your prerogative.

919
01:18:34,475 --> 01:18:38,296
Just do not appropriate my actual work for your new shortcut.

920
01:18:46,183 --> 01:18:48,118
I'm gonna do my thesis here.

921
01:18:48,985 --> 01:18:50,421
If you're gonna do it here too,

922
01:18:50,508 --> 01:18:52,909
I'm open to collaborating.

923
01:18:53,089 --> 01:18:55,526
And if not, I guess we can both
do separate theses

924
01:18:55,581 --> 01:18:56,781
on the Hårgas.

925
01:19:04,067 --> 01:19:06,370
Dude, of all the things
to let me sleep through.

926
01:19:06,671 --> 01:19:07,938
What?

927
01:19:17,948 --> 01:19:19,248
We're leaving tomorrow morning.

928
01:19:19,407 --> 01:19:20,408
I know we are.

929
01:19:28,735 --> 01:19:30,509
Sorry, Hi..

930
01:19:30,534 --> 01:19:32,463
I don't mean to disturb you.

931
01:19:33,124 --> 01:19:34,226
Hello.

932
01:19:34,601 --> 01:19:35,929
Hi, my name's Christian.

933
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:45,140
Hello, my name is Urla.

934
01:19:45,382 --> 01:19:46,538
- Urla?
- Urla.

935
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:49,702
- This is Maja.
- Maja, Hi.

936
01:19:51,382 --> 01:19:53,116
Eh, what are you guys doing?

937
01:19:53,429 --> 01:19:56,015
We are decorating the tree,

938
01:19:57,999 --> 01:20:00,452
I was wondering if I could ask you a question.

939
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:02,639
- Of course.
- How many, eh,

940
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:05,890
How many times have you seen the Attestupon?

941
01:20:07,577 --> 01:20:08,983
Attestupan

942
01:20:09,015 --> 01:20:11,124
Attestupan? How many times have you seen it performed?

943
01:20:11,831 --> 01:20:16,253
Every time one reaches age, so...

944
01:20:18,006 --> 01:20:19,514
- A lot.
- Okay.

945
01:20:20,459 --> 01:20:24,545
And do you have a typical period of grieving?

946
01:20:24,696 --> 01:20:28,243
Is there a time when you mourn?

947
01:20:28,747 --> 01:20:32,184
We grieve and celebrate.

948
01:20:33,942 --> 01:20:36,169
Yes, okay, I see.

949
01:20:36,764 --> 01:20:38,333
I told Christian this already,

950
01:20:38,465 --> 01:20:40,034
and now I think he's trying
to pretend like it's his idea,

951
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:41,870
- so if he comes up to you...
- Well, no,

952
01:20:41,895 --> 01:20:43,597
wait a minute.
I... I seriously doubt that

953
01:20:43,838 --> 01:20:45,572
the elders will approve of
anything being written down.

954
01:20:45,706 --> 01:20:47,108
They're extremely protective.

955
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:48,742
Okay, so then, I'll just use
aliases for everything.

956
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:50,410
- Problem solved.
- Then what would be the point?

957
01:20:50,544 --> 01:20:51,913
You couldn't even get it peer reviewed.

958
01:20:52,046 --> 01:20:54,114
And Christian did already ask me this,
by the way,

959
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:57,085
and I told him the same thing
I'm telling you now.

960
01:20:57,218 --> 01:20:59,487
I thought you said
you hadn't talked to him.

961
01:20:59,558 --> 01:21:00,759
Ah, fuck. No.

962
01:21:00,915 --> 01:21:03,084
Okay, look, uh, I'll ask the elders.

963
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:05,059
- Okay? Good.
- Yep.

964
01:21:16,133 --> 01:21:17,399
Dani?

965
01:21:19,177 --> 01:21:21,012
Um... I'm really sorry, Pelle.

966
01:21:21,123 --> 01:21:22,991
Thank you for inviting me,
but I... I really have to go.

967
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,812
Can someone maybe
drive me somewhere?

968
01:21:24,946 --> 01:21:26,480
I know I shouldn't have
let you stay for that.

969
01:21:26,613 --> 01:21:29,617
I mean, I know it looks extreme.
But we only...

970
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:31,653
I don't know why I'm here, Pelle!

971
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:32,954
I don't know why you invited us.

972
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:34,655
I don't know.
I don't know why...

973
01:21:34,788 --> 01:21:36,328
- I don't know why I'm here.
- Okay, okay, okay.

974
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:37,860
- It's fine. It's okay.
- I don't know and I can't...

975
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:39,695
- Come on. Come on, sit down.
- No.

976
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:40,963
Dani, please.

977
01:21:41,097 --> 01:21:42,630
Please sit down.

978
01:21:43,631 --> 01:21:44,900
Dani.

979
01:21:47,053 --> 01:21:48,321
I invited my friends

980
01:21:48,525 --> 01:21:49,692
because this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing,

981
01:21:49,803 --> 01:21:51,370
and I wanted to share it.

982
01:21:51,395 --> 01:21:54,733
Especially with my friends
who I knew would appreciate it.

983
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,045
Because I...

984
01:21:56,179 --> 01:21:57,679
- I am proud of this place.
- Okay.

985
01:21:57,704 --> 01:21:59,307
Okay, but I'm not an anthropologist

986
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:00,749
and I don't understand any of this.

987
01:22:00,883 --> 01:22:02,151
- Yes, yes, yes. I know.
- I don't get it.

988
01:22:02,285 --> 01:22:03,452
I know.
And, and yet,

989
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,854
I was the most excited for you to come.

990
01:22:06,494 --> 01:22:10,001
Here.
Here, smell this.

991
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:12,828
What is it?

992
01:22:12,963 --> 01:22:14,730
- It calms you down.
- No, I'm fine.

993
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:16,932
I don't want it.

994
01:22:18,335 --> 01:22:19,456
- Are you sure?
- No...

995
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:21,215
I really want to go, Pelle.
I don't... I don't want it.

996
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:24,239
Okay.

997
01:22:24,475 --> 01:22:26,676
I know what you're going through, Dani.

998
01:22:28,311 --> 01:22:29,945
What am I going through?

999
01:22:30,079 --> 01:22:31,613
Because I lost my parents, too.

1000
01:22:31,747 --> 01:22:33,582
- What? No, no, Pelle.
- Yes, yes, yes...

1001
01:22:33,607 --> 01:22:34,841
That is not what I'm talking about.

1002
01:22:35,085 --> 01:22:37,082
- I'm not talking about my family.
- I know that's not what you're talking about.

1003
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:39,793
I lost my parents when I was a little boy.

1004
01:22:39,831 --> 01:22:41,365
They burned up in a fire.

1005
01:22:41,455 --> 01:22:42,791
No, I wasn't talking about that.

1006
01:22:43,274 --> 01:22:46,344
My parents, they burned up in a fire

1007
01:22:46,696 --> 01:22:48,865
and I became, technically, an orphan.

1008
01:22:48,999 --> 01:22:51,769
So believe me when I tell you
that I know what it's like.

1009
01:22:51,902 --> 01:22:55,005
Because I do,
I really, really do.

1010
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:00,577
Yet my difference is,
I never got the chance to feel lost,

1011
01:23:00,711 --> 01:23:04,614
because I had a family here.

1012
01:23:04,748 --> 01:23:09,053
Where everyone embraced me.
And swept me up.

1013
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,356
And I was raised by
a community that doesn't

1014
01:23:12,381 --> 01:23:16,084
bicker over what's theirs
and what's not theirs.

1015
01:23:16,927 --> 01:23:18,728
That's what you were given.

1016
01:23:19,463 --> 01:23:22,266
But I have always felt held.

1017
01:23:25,986 --> 01:23:29,355
By a family.
A real family.

1018
01:23:34,644 --> 01:23:36,646
Which everyone deserves.

1019
01:23:38,516 --> 01:23:40,051
And you deserve.

1020
01:23:47,129 --> 01:23:48,398
Pelle, Christian could walk in.

1021
01:23:48,593 --> 01:23:50,594
He's what I'm talking about.

1022
01:23:53,265 --> 01:23:55,767
He's my good friend
and I like him, but...

1023
01:23:56,935 --> 01:23:59,570
Dani, do you feel held by him?

1024
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:04,277
Does he feel like home to you?

1025
01:24:45,417 --> 01:24:47,753
Hey. How you doing?

1026
01:24:48,721 --> 01:24:50,723
Today was tough.

1027
01:24:53,692 --> 01:24:55,194
You gonna be okay?

1028
01:24:57,830 --> 01:25:00,200
Are you not disturbed
by what we just saw?

1029
01:25:00,766 --> 01:25:03,636
Yeah, of course I am.

1030
01:25:03,769 --> 01:25:06,406
That was really, really shocking.

1031
01:25:08,242 --> 01:25:10,109
I'm trying to keep an open mind though.

1032
01:25:11,519 --> 01:25:13,422
That's cultural, you know?

1033
01:25:13,447 --> 01:25:15,748
We stick our elders in nursing homes.

1034
01:25:15,882 --> 01:25:18,084
I'm sure they find that disturbing.

1035
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:24,194
Hello.

1036
01:25:25,234 --> 01:25:28,171
Would you like to be joining us with a special ceremony?

1037
01:25:29,601 --> 01:25:31,343
Why?
What's happening now?

1038
01:27:58,599 --> 01:28:00,232
What's happening?

1039
01:28:05,849 --> 01:28:07,755
What's happening?

1040
01:28:13,841 --> 01:28:15,240
No, wait, stop!

1041
01:28:53,222 --> 01:28:55,004
Okay, can you slow down?

1042
01:28:55,183 --> 01:28:56,504
Just wait a sec...

1043
01:28:56,847 --> 01:28:58,355
Please, Christian.

1044
01:28:58,676 --> 01:29:01,356
This is feeling really wrong.
We need to leave.

1045
01:29:02,489 --> 01:29:04,278
I know that this is weird.

1046
01:29:04,528 --> 01:29:06,122
But it's because it's alien.

1047
01:29:06,333 --> 01:29:08,887
We haven't been exposed to anything like this.

1048
01:29:08,973 --> 01:29:11,184
No, please. This is completely backwards.

1049
01:29:11,288 --> 01:29:14,070
- We need to acclimate
- I don't want to acclimate, I want to go.

1050
01:29:14,937 --> 01:29:16,968
Well, I can't, I'm sorry.

1051
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:20,077
I'm doing my thesis on this. Period.

1052
01:29:20,412 --> 01:29:21,881
What? Since when?

1053
01:29:22,397 --> 01:29:24,834
Since I decided. Today.

1054
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:28,364
You know what a nightmare this
has been for me to figure out.

1055
01:29:28,389 --> 01:29:31,341
And I've made the mistake of telling Josh
and now he's competing with me.

1056
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:34,341
So if he wants it, let him have it.
We need to leave.

1057
01:29:35,427 --> 01:29:37,615
Can you not see what's going on here?

1058
01:29:38,091 --> 01:29:39,576
This level of tradition?

1059
01:29:40,497 --> 01:29:43,130
No-one's seen this,
no-one's written anything on it.

1060
01:29:43,156 --> 01:29:44,896
and they invited us to be a part of it.

1061
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:47,365
- Can't you see what a privilege that is?
- Why did they invite us?

1062
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:49,989
- Because Pelle did!
- Why did Pelle?

1063
01:29:50,014 --> 01:29:52,778
- Because he trusts us!
- Why would they trust us?

1064
01:29:53,052 --> 01:29:55,685
You're opportunistic anthropology students!

1065
01:29:55,903 --> 01:29:57,943
Maybe because we're anthropology students!

1066
01:29:57,968 --> 01:30:00,693
- Maybe they want somebody to document this.
- Oh my god, are you fucking blind?

1067
01:30:01,572 --> 01:30:03,635
They're doing Pagan rituals.

1068
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:05,213
People are jumping off cliffs.

1069
01:30:05,238 --> 01:30:07,885
They depend on no-one knowing about this.
Ever.

1070
01:30:08,713 --> 01:30:10,018
Not necessarily.

1071
01:30:12,674 --> 01:30:15,010
Okay, I want to leave.

1072
01:30:17,182 --> 01:30:18,534
Okay, than you can leave.

1073
01:30:19,151 --> 01:30:20,323
But I'm staying.

1074
01:30:21,542 --> 01:30:25,073
I invited you and I don't regret that,
but I'm here for a reason.

1075
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,338
Do you not love me anymore?

1076
01:30:42,331 --> 01:30:44,143
What does that have to do with this?

1077
01:30:45,081 --> 01:30:49,753
This is the devaluation phase, we've been
in it for a long time. Next comes discard.

1078
01:30:49,918 --> 01:30:53,887
Can you spare our relationship your textbook
Psychology keywords?

1079
01:30:54,004 --> 01:30:55,871
We've been in this for a while.

1080
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:59,699
You've been trying to pull away
and I have been in denial.

1081
01:31:05,927 --> 01:31:08,841
Please, give yourself some credit, babe.

1082
01:31:09,895 --> 01:31:11,708
Looks like you've got this all figured out.

1083
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:14,263
What?

1084
01:31:16,302 --> 01:31:18,888
Actually, you know what?
I'm going to say one thing.

1085
01:31:20,653 --> 01:31:24,700
When you casually gift me an impromptu bouquet of flowers

1086
01:31:25,075 --> 01:31:28,841
- What flowers?
- That just makes me think how and when am I supposed to pay that back?

1087
01:31:29,739 --> 01:31:32,762
Everything you give me is a reminder that

1088
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:34,192
I'm not doing enough for you in this relationship.

1089
01:31:34,677 --> 01:31:36,263
What, at lunch?

1090
01:31:37,177 --> 01:31:39,388
I picked those on a whim!

1091
01:31:39,426 --> 01:31:42,160
Don't try to tell me that you had no ulterior motive.

1092
01:31:42,185 --> 01:31:46,239
The day after I didn't get you something

1093
01:31:48,081 --> 01:31:49,799
Are you being serious?

1094
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:53,565
Okay, fine.

1095
01:31:54,354 --> 01:31:56,151
Play the wounded party, again.

1096
01:31:57,362 --> 01:32:00,456
You're just a self-denying altruist
and I'm a paranoid dick.

1097
01:32:00,736 --> 01:32:02,494
You don't have a conniving bone in your body.

1098
01:32:02,519 --> 01:32:05,455
- What is it that you think I'm conniving?
- You are, Dani!

1099
01:32:05,842 --> 01:32:08,765
I feel locked into your head every time you do something,
just because.

1100
01:32:08,790 --> 01:32:12,062
Because it's never just because.

1101
01:32:12,117 --> 01:32:13,788
- I was being kind
- Okay.

1102
01:32:13,999 --> 01:32:16,007
- Fine, I'm the asshole.
- Nobody's the asshole.

1103
01:32:16,032 --> 01:32:17,265
I clearly am.

1104
01:32:17,406 --> 01:32:20,788
You selflessly gave me flowers
and I feel trapped.

1105
01:32:21,312 --> 01:32:22,085
Fuck.

1106
01:32:22,335 --> 01:32:23,968
Are you actually going to leave?

1107
01:32:24,390 --> 01:32:27,296
- I'm supposed to be working here.
- You're going to leave me like this?

1108
01:32:28,413 --> 01:32:30,124
Christian.

1109
01:32:42,306 --> 01:32:43,639
Hey, do you... Sorry.

1110
01:32:43,881 --> 01:32:46,585
Um, do you have
a sleeping pill I can take?

1111
01:32:46,696 --> 01:32:47,630
Yeah, sure.

1112
01:32:47,756 --> 01:32:48,956
Thanks.

1113
01:33:15,439 --> 01:33:17,642
You're gonna wake her.

1114
01:36:19,125 --> 01:36:20,495
Yo, Pelle.

1115
01:36:35,811 --> 01:36:37,111
What'cha doin'?

1116
01:36:38,547 --> 01:36:40,282
Just working in the garden.

1117
01:36:46,021 --> 01:36:47,556
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

1118
01:36:47,991 --> 01:36:49,257
Any word?

1119
01:36:50,158 --> 01:36:51,660
Yeah, they said you can do it.

1120
01:36:51,793 --> 01:36:54,262
As long as you absolutely
don't use any names.

1121
01:36:54,396 --> 01:36:55,430
- Okay. Wow.
- Or the location

1122
01:36:55,564 --> 01:36:56,598
is never even hinted at.

1123
01:36:56,733 --> 01:36:58,166
- Okay.
- And you'll have to sign

1124
01:36:58,191 --> 01:36:59,559
an agreement to that.

1125
01:37:00,836 --> 01:37:02,838
And you're splitting it with Christian

1126
01:37:02,972 --> 01:37:05,540
because he came to me first.

1127
01:37:05,675 --> 01:37:08,076
Well, that's...
We'll... we'll figure that out.

1128
01:37:08,147 --> 01:37:09,248
I gotta go take a leak.

1129
01:37:09,444 --> 01:37:12,015
Uh, here, can I ask you something?

1130
01:37:12,147 --> 01:37:13,181
- Yeah.
- Uh...

1131
01:37:13,275 --> 01:37:16,311
Do you know what this is?

1132
01:37:17,352 --> 01:37:19,889
I found it under Christian's bed.

1133
01:37:20,023 --> 01:37:24,627
Oh. That's a love rune.
Casts a love spell.

1134
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:27,530
- A love rune. Huh.
- Yeah.

1135
01:37:27,665 --> 01:37:29,733
- Under Christian's bed?
- Yeah, yeah.

1136
01:37:32,301 --> 01:37:34,337
What's going on?

1137
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:36,538
Uh, the elders said
you can do your thesis

1138
01:37:36,563 --> 01:37:39,375
as long as you don't use
the actual names or location.

1139
01:37:40,009 --> 01:37:41,045
Are you serious?

1140
01:37:41,177 --> 01:37:42,545
Yeah.

1141
01:37:42,679 --> 01:37:45,382
Oh, my God, thank you, man.

1142
01:37:45,516 --> 01:37:47,550
That is incredible news.
Thank you.

1143
01:37:47,684 --> 01:37:49,153
You're splitting it with Josh as well.

1144
01:37:49,285 --> 01:37:52,089
Yeah, I already told him
I'm totally fine with that.

1145
01:37:52,221 --> 01:37:53,957
Okay. Well, I think my sister

1146
01:37:54,059 --> 01:37:55,927
Maja has taken a liking to you.

1147
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:58,729
Yeah?

1148
01:37:59,462 --> 01:38:01,065
The red head?

1149
01:38:01,197 --> 01:38:04,935
Actually, she just got
the <i>byxmyndig</i> last year.

1150
01:38:06,269 --> 01:38:08,872
It basically means that,
uh, you are...

1151
01:38:09,006 --> 01:38:12,810
You are allowed to have sex.
Pants license.

1152
01:38:12,943 --> 01:38:16,810
- Okay. Good for her.
- Hey!

1153
01:38:38,235 --> 01:38:40,404
Dude!

1154
01:38:40,472 --> 01:38:42,307
You pissed on the ancestral tree.

1155
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,042
- The tree... So what?
- Yes, yes.

1156
01:38:44,175 --> 01:38:46,009
"So what?"

1157
01:38:47,908 --> 01:38:49,410
That tree is tied to all of our dead.

1158
01:38:49,614 --> 01:38:51,883
It's a dead tree, though.

1159
01:38:52,016 --> 01:38:53,551
- It's dead.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

1160
01:38:53,685 --> 01:38:55,086
But it's important to us.

1161
01:38:55,221 --> 01:38:57,388
I just had to pee.
I didn't know it was special.

1162
01:38:57,659 --> 01:39:00,018
We know. We know that you didn't know that.

1163
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:03,202
- How was I supposed to know?
- You wouldn't pee on a gravestone right?

1164
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,077
Obviously not, but...

1165
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:08,242
Fuck, I mean...

1166
01:39:08,898 --> 01:39:12,382
I don't know what I'm apologizing...
Do I apologize?

1167
01:39:13,731 --> 01:39:14,988
Apologise later.

1168
01:39:15,621 --> 01:39:17,988
- Okay.
- Shit, hi.

1169
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:26,121
Okay.

1170
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:33,396
What did she say?

1171
01:39:34,161 --> 01:39:39,946
She said it's gonna be okay and that she'll to
Ulf and apologize for the mistake.

1172
01:39:40,212 --> 01:39:43,001
- Seriously? What else did she say?
- Yeah.

1173
01:39:54,556 --> 01:39:56,462
- Hey.
- Hi.

1174
01:39:57,790 --> 01:39:59,157
Did you get some good sleep?

1175
01:39:59,735 --> 01:40:00,556
Hmhm.

1176
01:40:01,298 --> 01:40:02,274
Good.

1177
01:40:03,384 --> 01:40:04,634
What happened over there?

1178
01:40:05,742 --> 01:40:07,821
Mark's just...

1179
01:40:23,287 --> 01:40:24,982
I'm sorry about last night.

1180
01:40:25,654 --> 01:40:26,693
How are you feeling?

1181
01:40:31,006 --> 01:40:33,022
I don't want us to be fighting, Christian.

1182
01:40:34,053 --> 01:40:35,202
Wel...

1183
01:40:36,358 --> 01:40:37,678
Me neither.

1184
01:41:09,074 --> 01:41:10,342
Hey.

1185
01:41:10,851 --> 01:41:12,858
Hey.
It was really nice to meet you.

1186
01:41:12,959 --> 01:41:15,155
I'm so sorry.
We're actually leaving.

1187
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:16,381
What?

1188
01:41:16,781 --> 01:41:18,694
- Yeah.
- Connie.

1189
01:41:18,787 --> 01:41:20,737
Simon is getting
the truck with one of them now.

1190
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:23,043
- Connie.
- Is everything okay?

1191
01:41:24,077 --> 01:41:25,444
Connie.

1192
01:41:26,023 --> 01:41:27,559
Oh, there.

1193
01:41:28,245 --> 01:41:30,462
Uh, Simon, he told me to tell you

1194
01:41:30,690 --> 01:41:33,191
that, uh, Jan drove him
to the train station.

1195
01:41:33,233 --> 01:41:35,634
And after, uh, Simon gets dropped off,

1196
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:38,317
he's sending the truck back for you.

1197
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:39,230
What?

1198
01:41:39,473 --> 01:41:42,575
You will meet him, uh, there.

1199
01:41:42,709 --> 01:41:44,177
No.

1200
01:41:44,496 --> 01:41:46,045
Why would he just go without me?

1201
01:41:46,179 --> 01:41:47,448
He... He wouldn't do that.

1202
01:41:47,581 --> 01:41:50,550
Well, the truck only had room for two.

1203
01:41:50,683 --> 01:41:51,986
So...

1204
01:41:52,118 --> 01:41:54,922
What does that mean?

1205
01:41:55,054 --> 01:41:55,990
That doesn't even make any sense.

1206
01:41:56,122 --> 01:41:57,490
He would have told me.

1207
01:41:57,624 --> 01:41:59,827
Today's only train
leaves in 90 minutes.

1208
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:02,429
It takes about 35 minutes
to go there and back.

1209
01:42:02,563 --> 01:42:04,632
So they didn't want to waste time.

1210
01:42:04,765 --> 01:42:07,001
So I could have sat on his lap.

1211
01:42:07,133 --> 01:42:08,535
Yes, I imagined that, too,

1212
01:42:08,669 --> 01:42:12,006
but, you know, we...
We don't break traffic laws.

1213
01:42:12,138 --> 01:42:13,407
Okay?

1214
01:42:16,448 --> 01:42:18,316
So they've just gone.
They've left me just now.

1215
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:20,756
Now, Connie.
There was no room in the truck.

1216
01:42:20,781 --> 01:42:24,018
Yet, it is coming right back for you.
Yeah.

1217
01:42:27,956 --> 01:42:29,324
This is bullshit.

1218
01:42:39,096 --> 01:42:41,163
Okay, lunch in a bit.

1219
01:42:59,110 --> 01:43:03,912
And how are jobs or roles assigned?

1220
01:43:04,045 --> 01:43:06,333
That's based on traits we show as kids.

1221
01:43:07,733 --> 01:43:09,038
For example

1222
01:43:09,311 --> 01:43:11,038
He was assigned to protect.
So he's made his pegamist as doctor.

1223
01:43:15,179 --> 01:43:16,851
Is he going to be okay?

1224
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:20,249
Yeah.

1225
01:43:20,796 --> 01:43:22,242
He's a very sensitive guy.

1226
01:43:22,874 --> 01:43:24,335
It's a big week for him.

1227
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:27,609
- Hey.
- Hi, sorry.

1228
01:43:29,467 --> 01:43:31,468
Simon left without Connie.

1229
01:43:32,374 --> 01:43:34,276
- Jesus, really?
- Yeah.

1230
01:43:34,410 --> 01:43:35,878
What a dick move.

1231
01:43:36,812 --> 01:43:38,569
- Is she okay?
- Uh, no.

1232
01:43:38,614 --> 01:43:40,483
- She just got told.
- Did she say why?

1233
01:43:40,508 --> 01:43:41,775
No, no.

1234
01:43:42,534 --> 01:43:44,035
That sucks.

1235
01:43:46,357 --> 01:43:49,658
On the... On the subject
of couples actually, um...

1236
01:43:50,794 --> 01:43:53,663
Is there ever an issue here with incest?

1237
01:43:55,365 --> 01:43:58,968
Sorry, I mean, you know,
small communities.

1238
01:43:59,102 --> 01:44:02,577
Well, the bloodlines
are very well-preserved.

1239
01:44:02,631 --> 01:44:05,375
So, uh, the elders must approve mates.

1240
01:44:05,508 --> 01:44:07,877
Cousins can sometimes mate.

1241
01:44:08,011 --> 01:44:11,114
But we do respect their incest taboo.

1242
01:44:11,247 --> 01:44:16,494
So we often need to
invite outside people.

1243
01:44:36,206 --> 01:44:38,741
Excuse me.
Hey.

1244
01:44:39,709 --> 01:44:41,711
Would you like to help join us?

1245
01:44:45,616 --> 01:44:48,120
- Sure, yeah.
- Come.

1246
01:44:48,253 --> 01:44:51,088
Do you... do you know, um...

1247
01:44:51,222 --> 01:44:53,290
Have you seen Simon anywhere?

1248
01:44:53,425 --> 01:44:55,793
Yes. He was driven to the station.

1249
01:44:55,926 --> 01:44:57,496
Did you not say goodbye?

1250
01:44:57,628 --> 01:44:58,963
No. No, I didn't.

1251
01:44:59,096 --> 01:45:01,665
But, uh, that's okay, that's okay.

1252
01:45:02,361 --> 01:45:04,430
Hi.

1253
01:45:08,772 --> 01:45:10,342
What are we making here?

1254
01:45:10,475 --> 01:45:11,842
Meat tarts!

1255
01:45:18,116 --> 01:45:19,985
She says you're so beautiful.

1256
01:45:20,718 --> 01:45:22,555
Oh, thank you!

1257
01:45:22,687 --> 01:45:25,223
Um, she's so beautiful.

1258
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:47,830
We describe it
like emotional sheet music.

1259
01:45:47,964 --> 01:45:49,465
Hmm. What does it say?

1260
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:52,168
Well, each runic letter

1261
01:45:52,302 --> 01:45:55,005
stands for one of the 16 affects,

1262
01:45:55,139 --> 01:45:59,175
which are graded from
most holy to most unholy.

1263
01:45:59,309 --> 01:46:01,645
This one, for example,
is about grief.

1264
01:46:02,846 --> 01:46:04,882
You can see at the end, however,

1265
01:46:05,015 --> 01:46:07,718
we have blank pages.

1266
01:46:07,851 --> 01:46:12,703
This is because the <i>Rubi Radr</i>
is a work forever in progress.

1267
01:46:13,249 --> 01:46:14,217
Forever evolving.

1268
01:46:14,242 --> 01:46:16,961
We have many, many hundreds of these.

1269
01:46:18,294 --> 01:46:22,032
And who decides what gets added?

1270
01:46:22,166 --> 01:46:26,904
Well, uh, this iteration
is being written by Rubin.

1271
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:33,011
Uh, the disabled?

1272
01:46:33,144 --> 01:46:35,179
Since birth.

1273
01:46:35,311 --> 01:46:39,316
He draws and we, the elders, interpret.

1274
01:46:40,784 --> 01:46:41,820
You see, Josh,

1275
01:46:41,953 --> 01:46:45,221
Rubin is unclouded by normal cognition.

1276
01:46:45,355 --> 01:46:48,625
It makes him open for the source.

1277
01:46:48,759 --> 01:46:55,233
Uh, what happens when Rubin dies?

1278
01:46:55,366 --> 01:46:58,368
Do you just wait for a baby that is...

1279
01:47:00,305 --> 01:47:01,339
Not clouded?

1280
01:47:01,473 --> 01:47:02,707
No, no, no.

1281
01:47:02,841 --> 01:47:06,011
Uh, Rubin was a product of inbreeding.

1282
01:47:06,945 --> 01:47:07,846
All of our Oracles

1283
01:47:07,979 --> 01:47:10,916
are deliberate products of inbreeding.

1284
01:47:14,384 --> 01:47:15,754
Can I take a photograph?

1285
01:47:17,255 --> 01:47:18,823
What?

1286
01:47:18,958 --> 01:47:20,226
Uh, a photograph?

1287
01:47:20,358 --> 01:47:23,762
- No. Absolutely not.
- Okay, sorry.

1288
01:47:23,895 --> 01:47:26,564
Absolutely not.

1289
01:47:51,356 --> 01:47:53,359
Oh, fuck, yep, that's her.

1290
01:48:00,901 --> 01:48:01,968
Hey.

1291
01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:11,477
Oh, great.
She's walking away.

1292
01:48:31,744 --> 01:48:33,012
Thank you.

1293
01:48:40,006 --> 01:48:42,009
Thanks.

1294
01:48:42,741 --> 01:48:43,977
Thanks.

1295
01:48:50,116 --> 01:48:51,785
Has anyone seen Connie?

1296
01:48:53,851 --> 01:48:55,586
I think Mark saw her earlier.

1297
01:48:56,597 --> 01:48:57,800
I'm sure I saw her trying out

1298
01:48:57,825 --> 01:48:59,359
for the sprinting Olympics earlier.

1299
01:48:59,492 --> 01:49:00,661
What?
Where?

1300
01:49:00,771 --> 01:49:02,573
Sorry, but I can say what happened.

1301
01:49:02,730 --> 01:49:04,031
Her boyfriend called the landline

1302
01:49:04,166 --> 01:49:06,366
from the train station
and calmed Connie down.

1303
01:49:06,499 --> 01:49:09,369
Then she begged our pardon
and I drove her to meet him.

1304
01:49:12,740 --> 01:49:14,308
Okay, well, that's a relief.

1305
01:49:14,528 --> 01:49:16,563
Why would Simon leave without her?

1306
01:49:17,945 --> 01:49:20,082
I'm sure it was just a miscommunication.

1307
01:49:37,398 --> 01:49:39,600
I could see you possibly doing that.

1308
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:46,107
What the hell does that mean?

1309
01:49:52,381 --> 01:49:53,649
Never mind.

1310
01:50:00,322 --> 01:50:03,558
Someone's still sore
about their ancestral tree.

1311
01:50:09,332 --> 01:50:11,133
Dude, is he going to kill me?

1312
01:50:14,003 --> 01:50:16,571
Did you learn anything
about the <i>Rubi Radr?</i>

1313
01:50:22,644 --> 01:50:24,180
Oh, so now you wanna collaborate?

1314
01:50:24,314 --> 01:50:25,548
Okay, thank you.

1315
01:50:25,682 --> 01:50:26,682
- I know that one elder...
- Thank you.

1316
01:50:26,815 --> 01:50:27,950
...gave you a glimpse of it.

1317
01:50:28,084 --> 01:50:29,685
Thank you.
Sorry I brought it up.

1318
01:50:53,642 --> 01:50:56,612
Oh, my God, dude.
What the fuck?

1319
01:50:56,746 --> 01:50:58,381
- Is that...
- What is that?

1320
01:50:58,513 --> 01:51:00,350
- Is that a fucking pube?
- Ew.

1321
01:51:00,482 --> 01:51:01,483
It's just a hair.

1322
01:51:01,616 --> 01:51:03,219
Yeah, a pubic hair.

1323
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:05,357
Dude, calm down.

1324
01:51:05,489 --> 01:51:06,756
Why are you embarrassed?

1325
01:51:06,889 --> 01:51:09,625
You're not the one giving out hair pies.

1326
01:51:29,114 --> 01:51:31,915
Jesus Christ.
He's still fucking lookin' at me.

1327
01:51:32,049 --> 01:51:34,718
Hey.
You'll come with me?

1328
01:51:35,853 --> 01:51:37,688
- What?
- You'll come?

1329
01:51:38,322 --> 01:51:39,823
- Uh...
- I'll show you.

1330
01:51:40,224 --> 01:51:41,525
Okay, sure.

1331
01:51:41,658 --> 01:51:43,994
- Yeah?
- Yeah, great.

1332
01:51:45,996 --> 01:51:48,198
I'll be back.
I guess she's gonna show me.

1333
01:52:11,289 --> 01:52:13,526
Hey, can I, uh,
borrow another sleeping pill?

1334
01:52:13,658 --> 01:52:15,261
- Yeah, sure, yeah.
- Thanks.

1335
01:52:18,196 --> 01:52:19,197
Thank you.

1336
01:54:07,974 --> 01:54:10,377
What the fuck, Mark?

1337
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:12,045
What the fuck are you doing?
Close the door,

1338
01:54:12,179 --> 01:54:14,182
we're not supposed to be in here.

1339
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:13,375
Do you think Mark's still up with that girl?

1340
01:55:14,542 --> 01:55:16,078
I wouldn't be surprised.

1341
01:55:19,082 --> 01:55:20,283
What about Josh though?

1342
01:55:20,416 --> 01:55:22,484
I'm honestly not too concerned.

1343
01:55:26,222 --> 01:55:28,326
We, um,

1344
01:55:28,358 --> 01:55:31,561
have something regretful to announce.

1345
01:55:31,694 --> 01:55:35,331
This morning
the 19th Book of <i>Rubi Radr</i>

1346
01:55:35,465 --> 01:55:37,933
was found missing from the Temple.

1347
01:55:39,301 --> 01:55:42,138
We don't want to point fingers,

1348
01:55:42,272 --> 01:55:44,340
yet, we kindly ask that whoever took it

1349
01:55:44,474 --> 01:55:46,676
to return it to its original place.

1350
01:55:46,808 --> 01:55:48,344
You can leave it in the Temple,

1351
01:55:48,478 --> 01:55:51,314
<i>which will be left unguarded,
unwatched.</i>

1352
01:55:51,447 --> 01:55:54,450
<i>Nobody needs to know
it was you.</i>

1353
01:56:07,330 --> 01:56:08,798
Where is your friend, Josh?

1354
01:56:08,931 --> 01:56:12,168
I know. Uh, we have no idea.

1355
01:56:12,934 --> 01:56:15,071
He and your other friend,

1356
01:56:15,204 --> 01:56:17,939
they both disappears the same day.

1357
01:56:19,543 --> 01:56:21,145
- You see how it looks?
- Yes, obviously.

1358
01:56:21,278 --> 01:56:23,280
But I swear to you
we're in the dark on this.

1359
01:56:23,414 --> 01:56:25,417
We're just as confused as you are.

1360
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:29,286
We did see Mark go off
with that girl last night.

1361
01:56:30,187 --> 01:56:32,089
- What girl?
- Inge.

1362
01:56:32,222 --> 01:56:33,856
Yeah, but Mark wouldn't have done this.

1363
01:56:33,990 --> 01:56:35,726
Josh on the other hand,

1364
01:56:35,858 --> 01:56:36,994
he came to bed with us

1365
01:56:37,127 --> 01:56:38,663
and when we woke up,
he was gone.

1366
01:56:38,797 --> 01:56:40,998
And if he did take that book,
I just pray you understand

1367
01:56:41,131 --> 01:56:43,267
we don't associate as friends of his

1368
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:45,336
or collaborators or anything.

1369
01:56:45,469 --> 01:56:47,104
We would just be so embarrassed

1370
01:56:47,237 --> 01:56:49,906
to be connected to this
in any way, shape or form.

1371
01:56:51,642 --> 01:56:54,278
Let's hope it gets returned.

1372
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:55,913
I hope so too.

1373
01:56:56,046 --> 01:56:57,947
I feel responsible.

1374
01:56:58,082 --> 01:57:00,918
Well, you and Odd,
you can go looking for them.

1375
01:57:01,051 --> 01:57:03,421
- Yes.
- Maybe you can redeem this.

1376
01:57:04,756 --> 01:57:08,525
You are going with the women
for the day's activity.

1377
01:57:08,659 --> 01:57:09,993
Oh, hi.

1378
01:57:10,127 --> 01:57:13,131
And, uh, Siv wants to see you in her house.

1379
01:57:20,904 --> 01:57:22,607
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1380
01:57:23,341 --> 01:57:24,342
Okay.

1381
01:57:25,877 --> 01:57:27,078
Okay.

1382
01:58:08,187 --> 01:58:09,455
This is the big one.

1383
01:58:09,587 --> 01:58:12,290
Okay.
Thank you.

1384
01:58:16,162 --> 01:58:17,629
Look into her eyes.

1385
01:58:19,364 --> 01:58:22,934
BUm, can I ask what this is exactly?

1386
01:58:23,068 --> 01:58:26,338
It's, um... tea for the competition.

1387
01:58:32,379 --> 01:58:36,048
- And then you, glass here.
- Mmm-hmm.

1388
01:58:37,784 --> 01:58:38,785
And then we drink it.

1389
01:58:39,219 --> 01:58:40,620
- Okay?
- Okay.

1390
01:58:41,755 --> 01:58:42,955
Okay.

1391
01:58:51,130 --> 01:58:53,200
- Oh, God.
- Here we go!

1392
02:00:55,758 --> 02:00:57,193
Please.
Come in.

1393
02:01:50,557 --> 02:01:51,725
First thing I just have to say,

1394
02:01:51,750 --> 02:01:54,183
I have no idea where Josh is.

1395
02:01:54,318 --> 02:01:56,387
And I can swear to that
on my mother's life.

1396
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:58,522
How do you feel about Maja?

1397
02:02:03,005 --> 02:02:04,507
About Maja?

1398
02:02:09,961 --> 02:02:12,730
How do I feel about her how?

1399
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:15,707
You have been approved
to mate with her.

1400
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:19,643
You're an ideal astrological match.

1401
02:02:19,777 --> 02:02:22,513
And she has fixed her hopes on you.

1402
02:02:26,161 --> 02:02:28,305
I'm trying to understand what you mean.

1403
02:02:30,501 --> 02:02:32,775
I haven't even spoken to her.

1404
02:02:33,835 --> 02:02:35,623
She fixed on you before you came.

1405
02:02:36,326 --> 02:02:38,393
Pelle showed her a photo.

1406
02:02:46,405 --> 02:02:48,080
I'm here with someone.

1407
02:02:48,601 --> 02:02:49,981
I'm with Dani.

1408
02:02:50,276 --> 02:02:51,865
Dani will not know.

1409
02:02:53,323 --> 02:02:55,511
I'm not proposing marriage.

1410
02:02:56,735 --> 02:02:58,454
You wouldn't be approved for that.

1411
02:03:01,483 --> 02:03:03,801
Okay, so what is it you're asking?

1412
02:03:05,276 --> 02:03:08,323
I'm asking if you care to mate with Maja.

1413
02:03:08,948 --> 02:03:10,919
It's a one-night offer.

1414
02:03:18,938 --> 02:03:21,734
I think I ate one of her pubic hairs.

1415
02:03:21,759 --> 02:03:23,526
Sounds probably right.

1416
02:03:25,702 --> 02:03:27,429
From an academic perspective

1417
02:03:27,976 --> 02:03:32,299
it would also provide a unique glimpse
into our sexual rites.

1418
02:03:39,139 --> 02:03:42,083
Can I not have a unique glimpse without participating?

1419
02:04:25,702 --> 02:04:27,004
Stop!

1420
02:04:33,409 --> 02:04:35,379
Stay here.

1421
02:04:35,512 --> 02:04:37,114
Are you ready?

1422
02:04:37,247 --> 02:04:39,081
- What are we doing?
- You'll see.

1423
02:05:49,522 --> 02:05:51,590
Stop!

1424
02:05:55,594 --> 02:05:56,896
- You're so good!
- What does that mean?

1425
02:05:57,030 --> 02:05:58,114
- You're so good!
- What does that mean?

1426
02:05:58,159 --> 02:05:59,258
Eight! Eight!

1427
02:05:59,298 --> 02:06:00,536
- There are eight left.
- What?

1428
02:06:26,558 --> 02:06:28,628
- For you.
- Uh...

1429
02:06:29,663 --> 02:06:31,697
Thanks.

1430
02:06:32,506 --> 02:06:34,274
- What is it?
- Um...

1431
02:06:34,299 --> 02:06:36,036
It's... Sorry.

1432
02:06:37,437 --> 02:06:42,408
Spring water with special properties.

1433
02:06:44,318 --> 02:06:47,122
Okay.

1434
02:06:47,147 --> 02:06:49,901
- Okay.
- What does it do?

1435
02:06:52,687 --> 02:06:55,305
It breaks down your defenses

1436
02:06:55,355 --> 02:06:59,292
and opens you for the influence.

1437
02:07:00,161 --> 02:07:01,429
Okay.

1438
02:07:02,997 --> 02:07:04,497
Thanks.

1439
02:07:05,032 --> 02:07:06,534
You're welcome.

1440
02:07:07,563 --> 02:07:09,565
You know what? Um...

1441
02:07:09,603 --> 02:07:10,971
I'm worried I'll have a bad trip.

1442
02:07:11,261 --> 02:07:14,564
Oh, no, no. You won't.
You won't. Trust me.

1443
02:08:58,081 --> 02:09:01,350
- I don't speak Swedish.
- What?

1444
02:09:29,255 --> 02:09:31,325
What? What?

1445
02:09:40,291 --> 02:09:41,825
What's happening?

1446
02:09:43,793 --> 02:09:47,130
You are our May Queen.

1447
02:09:47,865 --> 02:09:49,399
- Me?
- Yes!

1448
02:09:49,533 --> 02:09:51,068
- Why?
- You won!

1449
02:09:52,368 --> 02:09:53,904
What does that mean?

1450
02:09:54,037 --> 02:09:55,372
What?
Oh.

1451
02:10:45,324 --> 02:10:47,625
Mom?
Mom?

1452
02:10:48,927 --> 02:10:52,164
Oh, my God, Dani!
May Queen!

1453
02:13:30,237 --> 02:13:31,238
Herring?

1454
02:13:31,827 --> 02:13:33,096
What for?

1455
02:13:34,130 --> 02:13:36,466
It's tradition.
For good luck.

1456
02:13:36,598 --> 02:13:38,033
Yeah.

1457
02:13:38,167 --> 02:13:40,937
- What?
- And you must eat it whole.

1458
02:13:41,070 --> 02:13:43,605
- But the tails go in first.
- No, no, no!

1459
02:13:43,738 --> 02:13:45,541
You must try!

1460
02:13:45,674 --> 02:13:47,676
- You must try!
- Ahhh!

1461
02:13:58,154 --> 02:14:00,255
Very good try.

1462
02:14:03,259 --> 02:14:04,626
Excuse me...

1463
02:14:05,928 --> 02:14:07,463
What's going on?

1464
02:14:16,038 --> 02:14:17,941
Why did you do that?

1465
02:14:24,916 --> 02:14:27,119
To our May Queen!

1466
02:14:30,331 --> 02:14:32,199
<i>Cheers!</i>

1467
02:14:44,001 --> 02:14:45,869
You are the family now! Yes?

1468
02:14:46,470 --> 02:14:48,338
Yes, you are the family.

1469
02:14:48,771 --> 02:14:50,073
Like sisters.

1470
02:16:05,597 --> 02:16:08,701
Your dance was amazing.

1471
02:16:09,147 --> 02:16:11,815
I've never seen someone dance like that.

1472
02:16:24,718 --> 02:16:27,154
Now, it's traditional for the May Queen

1473
02:16:27,287 --> 02:16:30,190
to bless our crops and livestock.

1474
02:16:31,625 --> 02:16:33,935
And after the luck you just inherited

1475
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:35,496
from that salt herring,

1476
02:16:35,628 --> 02:16:38,198
we should all be doubly encouraged.

1477
02:16:51,865 --> 02:16:53,667
Can Christian come with me?

1478
02:16:54,314 --> 02:16:55,416
No

1479
02:16:55,713 --> 02:16:57,280
The Queen must ride alone.

1480
02:19:55,026 --> 02:19:56,561
Repeat after me.

1481
02:20:42,748 --> 02:20:44,116
Breathe in.

1482
02:20:46,592 --> 02:20:49,061
For your vitality.

1483
02:25:17,001 --> 02:25:19,037
We shall go now to Siv's house.

1484
02:25:19,570 --> 02:25:20,838
What's this?

1485
02:25:20,972 --> 02:25:23,740
It is a special meeting,
only for the Queens.

1486
02:25:23,875 --> 02:25:25,343
And she will bless you.

1487
02:25:29,248 --> 02:25:30,316
What's that?

1488
02:25:30,448 --> 02:25:31,983
That's not for us.

1489
02:25:37,588 --> 02:25:38,957
I think you should not.

1490
02:27:28,269 --> 02:27:30,104
No, no, no.

1491
02:32:33,472 --> 02:32:34,840
Christian?

1492
02:32:36,290 --> 02:32:38,059
Christian.

1493
02:32:40,582 --> 02:32:41,849
Hi.

1494
02:32:43,346 --> 02:32:45,649
Hello, there you are.

1495
02:32:45,981 --> 02:32:47,348
Listen.

1496
02:32:47,483 --> 02:32:50,954
You can't speak.
You can't move.

1497
02:32:51,787 --> 02:32:53,155
All right?

1498
02:32:53,857 --> 02:32:55,156
Good.

1499
02:33:05,400 --> 02:33:10,441
On this, the day
of our deity of reciprocity,

1500
02:33:10,573 --> 02:33:13,944
we gather to give special thanks

1501
02:33:14,077 --> 02:33:16,079
to our treasured sun.

1502
02:33:16,212 --> 02:33:18,549
As an offering to our father,

1503
02:33:18,681 --> 02:33:23,353
we will today surrender nine human lives.

1504
02:33:24,239 --> 02:33:28,543
As Hårga takes,
so Hårga also gives.

1505
02:33:28,782 --> 02:33:33,454
Thus, for every new blood sacrificed,

1506
02:33:33,587 --> 02:33:37,323
we will dedicate one of our own.

1507
02:33:38,060 --> 02:33:41,331
That is four new bloods.

1508
02:33:41,938 --> 02:33:43,440
Four from Hårga.

1509
02:33:44,389 --> 02:33:47,794
And one to be chosen by the Queen.

1510
02:33:48,144 --> 02:33:51,281
Nine in all to die

1511
02:33:51,414 --> 02:33:55,853
and be reborn in the great cycle.

1512
02:33:55,986 --> 02:33:59,924
The four new bloods
have already been supplied.

1513
02:34:00,056 --> 02:34:05,262
As for our end,
we have two already dedicated

1514
02:34:08,031 --> 02:34:11,169
and two who have volunteered.

1515
02:34:11,942 --> 02:34:14,312
Ingemar and Ulf.

1516
02:34:17,742 --> 02:34:20,579
You have brought outside offerings.

1517
02:34:21,479 --> 02:34:25,382
Plus volunteering your own bodies.

1518
02:34:25,516 --> 02:34:29,955
You will today be joined
in harmony with everything.

1519
02:34:30,956 --> 02:34:35,259
And to Pelle,
who has brought new blood

1520
02:34:35,284 --> 02:34:37,420
and our new May Queen,

1521
02:34:37,662 --> 02:34:42,652
you will today be honored
for your unclouded intuition.

1522
02:34:42,740 --> 02:34:47,344
And so, for our ninth offering,

1523
02:34:47,687 --> 02:34:51,089
it is traditional that
our fair Queen shall choose

1524
02:34:51,114 --> 02:34:53,316
between a preselected new blood

1525
02:34:53,473 --> 02:34:57,142
and a specially-ordained Hårgan.

1526
02:35:23,209 --> 02:35:24,744
Turbeyon.

1527
02:35:25,531 --> 02:35:29,167
Honorable Turbeyon!
Please step forward.

1528
02:35:33,567 --> 02:35:34,634
And...

1529
02:35:53,385 --> 02:35:55,588
Christian Hughes.

1530
02:35:58,346 --> 02:36:00,047
These are the candidates

1531
02:36:00,312 --> 02:36:02,715
for the ninth and final offering.

1532
02:36:04,283 --> 02:36:07,386
We patiently await your verdict.
