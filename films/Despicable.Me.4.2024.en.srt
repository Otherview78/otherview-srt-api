1
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,292
Ah. Hmm.

2
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,337
Stuart.

3
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,465
Illumination!

4
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,695
Phil, Ron, Ralph! Stay focused.

5
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,989
Uh. Uh, okay, okay.

6
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,454
Hmm.

7
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,666
Okay, our target is Maxime Le Mal,

8
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,335
one of the Anti-Villain League's most wanted.

9
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,505
And, trust me, a real jerk.

10
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,966
So, there is no room for error. Got it?

11
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,635
Sí, boss.

12
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,357
Phil, Ron!

13
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,241
Ah.

14
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,993
Ah!

15
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:34,297
Kids can be so cruel, but Maxime can be even crueler.

16
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,471
Ho, ho, ho. Well, well, well.

17
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,889
Look who it is.

18
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,892
If it isn't Gru-ser the Loser.

19
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:49,646
Well, if it isn't Maxime Le Mal. You look...

20
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,607
Magnificent? Yes, I know.

21
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,859
What did you think, huh?

22
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,487
I was going to look like a bald loser with a dad bod?

23
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,699
Oops. Looks like you beat me to it, no?

24
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,036
- Ooh. - Ooh!

25
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,579
Oh.

26
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,290
It's good to laugh, no?

27
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,086
Anyway, you remember my girlfriend, Valentina?

28
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,298
She was captain of the Femme Fatale cheer squad,

29
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,801
and the most popular girl at school, huh?

30
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,386
I remember.

31
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,513
Good to see you, Valentina.

32
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,518
What happened, Gru?

33
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:33,273
All your dreams of becoming a famous villain, they go poof-poof, huh?

34
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,153
Well, I don't know if you know, but I did manage to steal the moon.

35
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,404
Really?

36
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,698
You mean, that moon?

37
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,744
Is this on?

38
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,413
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

39
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:53,168
Good evening and welcome, Lycée Pas Bon alumni.

40
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,505
Now, we're going to kick off the festivities

41
00:04:56,588 --> 00:05:00,383
by announcing the winner of our most coveted award,

42
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,427
The Golden Alumni.

43
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,432
And so, without further ado,

44
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:13,355
the winner of this year's Golden Alumni is, uh...

45
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,941
Oh, my favorite student.

46
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,609
Maxime Le Mal.

47
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,529
- What? Are you kidding me? - Thank you. Thank you.

48
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,697
Merci. Merci beaucoup.

49
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,907
No, you don't have to.

50
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,165
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

51
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,291
Thank you.

52
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:38,171
I'm sure you all know that I have something very big in the works.

53
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:43,426
Now, some of you laughed at my childhood obsession with cockroaches.

54
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,139
But I quickly learned that they are a miracle of evolution.

55
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,228
And I have found a way to harness the strength

56
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,189
and the speed and the... What is the word?

57
00:05:56,273 --> 00:06:00,944
"Unsquishability" of the most powerful creature on the planet.

58
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:06,658
Which makes me indestructible and unstoppable!

59
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,911
Maxime! Maxime! Maxime!

60
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,540
Behold the power of the cockroach!

61
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,864
So, my sad little friend, what do you say about that, huh?

62
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,742
Well, I'd say you're...

63
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:53,079
under arrest, courtesy of the Anti-Villain League.

64
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,916
Oh... I don't think so, mon ami

65
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,626
Oh, yeah? Goop grenade!

66
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
No!

67
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,512
Hi-yah!

68
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,889
Move in.

69
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,474
- AVL! - Everybody, freeze!

70
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,267
- Stay where you are. - Move!

71
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,569
Ha!

72
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:25,695
Stay there!

73
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:27,905
Freeze!

74
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,288
Gotcha!

75
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,374
No, no, no! No!

76
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,708
This is not happening!

77
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,502
C'est impossible.

78
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,462
Get your hands off of me!

79
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,132
I am commanding you to let me go.

80
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,592
So long, Maxime!

81
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,636
Who's the loser now?

82
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,681
Loser, loser, loser!

83
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,567
This is not over!

84
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,698
You won't always have the AVL to fight your battles, you coward!

85
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,909
Mark my words! I will exterminate you!

86
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,003
Not, uh... Not scary at all.

87
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,353
Hello, everybody!

88
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,105
- Gru, what's up? - Yay, Gru!

89
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,065
- Hey, Gru. - I'm so happy you're here!

90
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,192
What's shaking in the Gru house?

91
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,902
Look what I taught Lucky.

92
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,405
Lucky, sit.

93
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,994
Aw, Lucky, I said sit.

94
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,167
Well, it is only his first lesson.

95
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,794
Uh, maybe we practice outside from now on.

96
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,380
There's my favorite husband!

97
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,340
Did you remember to get the milk?

98
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,301
Well, yes. They had a few kinds.

99
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,803
They got the almond milk, soy milk, hemp milk,

100
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,598
oat milk, goat milk, chocolate milk, half-and-half,

101
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,184
powdered, and of magnesia.

102
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,478
What about regular milk?

103
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,813
No, they don't make that anymore.

104
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:24,939
Oh!

105
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,691
Wait a minute.

106
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,902
One, two, three girls.

107
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,737
One wife.

108
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,490
Something is missing.

109
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,284
No, I think that's all of us. Yeah.

110
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,078
You know what? I keep forgetting...

111
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,579
this guy!

112
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,042
Oh, ho, ho! There's my boy!

113
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,336
There he is!

114
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,879
Ah, coochy, coochy, coochy.

115
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,882
Where is Daddy's hug?

116
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,177
Oh, looks like somebody's a little cranky!

117
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,390
Behind that sourpuss, I know you love your dada!

118
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,767
Go on, say it.

119
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,353
Dada. Dada.

120
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,730
Yes, of course he loves you! He just...

121
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,982
He just doesn't show it on his face,

122
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,235
or with his body language.

123
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,112
Right, Gru Jr? Come on.

124
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,114
Show Daddy how much you love him.

125
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,867
Oh, I know what will make you happy!

126
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,246
Mmm, Bahama Medley!

127
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,917
No? It's from The Bahamas.

128
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,585
All of them. Look.

129
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,213
Oh, so yummy!

130
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,215
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

131
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,053
Oh, that really tastes like The Bahamas!

132
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,139
See? He loves his daddy!

133
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,182
He's sharing.

134
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,145
Phil, Ralph, Ron!

135
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,522
Hup, hup, hup!

136
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,274
Hup!

137
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,819
Pistachio. Yeah, cashew.

138
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,031
Gotcha!

139
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,214
Thanks, guys.

140
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,344
Ramsbottom?

141
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,888
Bottom.

142
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,641
- I need a word with you both. - Sure, but what...

143
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,852
I'm sorry. There's no time for chitchat.

144
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,063
Maxime Le Mal has sent you a message from prison.

145
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,692
Bonjour, Gru.

146
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,236
I know you can hear me, so hear this.

147
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,990
You think you can humiliate me and get away with it? Yes?

148
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,074
But, no!

149
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:43,786
When I break out of prison, I'm coming for my revenge, Gru!

150
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,041
But this time, I won't go so easy on you!

151
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,418
And I know where you live!

152
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:54,297
So you better sleep with one eye open, because you can't hide from me!

153
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,966
Sweet dreams, Gru-ser!

154
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,888
Don't worry. He can't get out of there.

155
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,432
It's a maximum security prison.

156
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,809
Ah, yes, well, um...

157
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,186
he escaped yesterday.

158
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,479
What?

159
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,314
Leave our home?

160
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,024
Oh, no. You're gonna love it.

161
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,567
It's called "the safe house"'

162
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:18,738
and it's fun, and it's safe, and it's fantastic and we're going.

163
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,115
Yeah, you'll get a new room, go to a new school.

164
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,867
It'll be fun, right?

165
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,744
Everything's gonna be new. We love new!

166
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,287
What about all my friends?

167
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,538
You'll make new friends.

168
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,207
Probably better ones.

169
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,960
I can't believe this.

170
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,712
Yes, yes. Lot of emotions. Big life change.

171
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,422
Less talking, more walking.

172
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,174
Come on, here we go.

173
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:51,521
I'm sorry you can't go with us, Lucky.

174
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,733
Take good care of him.

175
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,444
Be good, Lucky!

176
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,322
Don't forget to practice your tricks!

177
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,871
We'll arrive at the AVL safe house in a few hours.

178
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,999
Mayflower is a lovely town.

179
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,710
A lovely, safe, boring town.

180
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,545
Trust me, it is for the best, Gru.

181
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,673
And what about Grandma and Uncle Dru?

182
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,927
I'm sorry. No one can know of your whereabouts, not even family.

183
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,096
Bingo! There's your silver lining.

184
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,765
And you promise to take care of the other Minions?

185
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,768
They'll be safe and sound at AVL Headquarters.

186
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,937
I have big plans for them.

187
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,273
Good luck with that.

188
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,377
That is it!

189
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,304
Quiet!

190
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,351
You are now on Carl's bus.

191
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,729
And Carl is a longtime AVL employee

192
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,648
whose retirement benefits are almost vested.

193
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:22,862
So, while on Carl's bus, you follow Carl's rules.

194
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:27,116
No shenanigans, no antics and no tomfoolery.

195
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,409
Tom?

196
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,244
So this ends now.

197
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:34,832
Or you're gonna see a side of Carl you do not wanna see.

198
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,378
Do I make myself clear?

199
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,088
Bazooka!

200
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,179
This won't st...

201
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,889
Carl does not like this!

202
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,141
Watch your hands. What are you doing? Who's pinching?

203
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,601
No, no!

204
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,734
Here we are. The town of Mayflower.

205
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,781
This safe house has been used to protect our agents for decades now.

206
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,324
Whoa, look at that place.

207
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,285
Wow, look at these lawns. The flowers.

208
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,622
- Whoa! That is cool. - Are we really gonna live here?

209
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,457
- Look at that fountain. - Whoa!

210
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,376
Awesome.

211
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,169
Ooh, ooh, ooh, is that one ours?

212
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,170
Hey, hey.

213
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,673
- Whoa, look at that. - Ooh, that's pretty.

214
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,383
I could get used to this.

215
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,389
Ooh, it looks like a princess lives there.

216
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,808
And here it is.

217
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,061
Your new home.

218
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,860
Oh.

219
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,862
Hmm, no fountain.

220
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,448
I'm sure it's gonna be great.

221
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,531
Come on.

222
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,326
Silas says that there is a pool in the back.

223
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,828
That'll be fun, huh?

224
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:05,214
Wow, it's so cold and uninviting.

225
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,300
- But in a homey kind of way. - What?

226
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,636
Yes, everything here is AVL standard.

227
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,432
What it lacks in comfort, it more than makes up for in functionality.

228
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:18,060
There's even a fully automated lockdown mode.

229
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,228
Isn't that fun?

230
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,606
Ooh, full lockdown mode.

231
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,940
Yay.

232
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,526
- It has a vending machine. - Oh!

233
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,320
I love this place!

234
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,530
Ooh.

235
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,911
Eh, eh.

236
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,832
This will be great.

237
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,751
All right, now down to business.

238
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,379
For your own safety, you'll all be assuming new identities.

239
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,090
New identities? Is that really necessary?

240
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,134
It's not up for debate, Gru.

241
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,762
Now, you are a solar panel salesman.

242
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,390
Lucy, you're a hairstylist at an upscale salon.

243
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:00,228
A hairstylist? Yes, jackpot!

244
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,064
Silas, did you choose that because you knew I cut my own hair,

245
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,774
and that I would totally rock at this?

246
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,399
No.

247
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,569
"Chet Cunningham."

248
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,405
Ah, that's got a nice ring to it.

249
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,489
Girls.

250
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,035
Cool. I'm Blair.

251
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,370
"Britney"?

252
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,871
My name is Bree?

253
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,290
Oh, come on. There are worse names than Bree.

254
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,084
Yeah, like Blanche.

255
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,044
Yes, Margo.

256
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,256
Blanche? Ugh, that is a terrible name.

257
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,925
Imagine being named Blanche.

258
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,760
Truly, I cannot think of a worse...

259
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,221
My name's Blanche, isn't it?

260
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,597
Yep.

261
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,641
Well, I'll get used to it.

262
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,602
Well, why don't you girls go and pick out your rooms

263
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,397
while I have a word with your parents?

264
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,526
Yes, I didn't want to frighten the girls,

265
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,572
but it is absolutely crucial you keep your true identities under wraps.

266
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:56,492
Gru, you're going to have to try to not be so "Gru-ish."

267
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,286
What is that supposed to mean?

268
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:02,582
Well, I'm just saying you tend to stand out in a crowd, that's all.

269
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:06,294
You know... like the way you're always cranky and irritable.

270
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:10,006
And how you make things a bit awkward for everyone around you.

271
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,675
You do do that. I mean, you know...

272
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,843
Okay, enough.

273
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,013
I don't make people awkward or uncomfortable.

274
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,931
I'm very comforting.

275
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,933
Like a nice meat loaf.

276
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,935
I'm pretty delicious.

277
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,942
This is not awkward. You're the ones who are making it awkward.

278
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,236
Gru, you have to blend in.

279
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,238
Your family's lives are at stake.

280
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,323
You understand?

281
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,325
Of course, yes. Fully understand.

282
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,077
We would do anything to keep our family safe. Yeah.

283
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,497
Right, well, I'll be in contact when this is all over.

284
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:48,502
Until then, capturing Maxime Le Mal is our top priority.

285
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,005
Stay safe.

286
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,427
You know what, Gru, maybe this isn't so bad.

287
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,640
We need a break from chasing down villains and dangerous missions, right?

288
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,100
We can actually be a normal family for once.

289
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:08,397
And I can finally spend some real bonding time with the baby.

290
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,150
It's gonna be great. Right, pal?

291
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,235
Who's got your nose? Who's got...

292
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,988
He's got my nose.

293
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,576
Quite the grip there. That kid is strong.

294
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,044
Ah.

295
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,659
Thank you. Look at everyone. Yes.

296
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,828
We are having a good time, right?

297
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,376
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

298
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,086
Whoo-hoo!

299
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,755
No, I love you.

300
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,758
Thank you, my beautiful army.

301
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,886
Maxime's back, baby.

302
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:28,436
And a special merci beaucoup to everyone who helped me break out of AVL prison.

303
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,021
Todd and Linda, where are you? Where are you? Yes.

304
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,773
For distracting the guards.

305
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,734
- Oh, très magnifique. - Yeah!

306
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,486
Now, silence!

307
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,531
We must make Gru suffer for arresting me.

308
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:47,413
And what better way than to take away from him his precious little baby.

309
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,582
I want to take that baby.

310
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,833
Whoa.

311
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,917
Yeah!

312
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,377
Oh, Maxime.

313
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,629
No, no. Wait, wait. Not Maxime.

314
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,675
What if I start going by "Cockroach Man" ' huh?

315
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,136
Little on the nose, but it is very clear.

316
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,471
- It's good, no? - Ugh.

317
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:08,392
I am not calling you that stupid name, but I love this evil plan.

318
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,311
Well, Gru has it coming.

319
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,147
He humiliated me in front of the whole school.

320
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,400
I had my trophy and everything.

321
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:19,487
But now the game begins.

322
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:24,909
He runs and hides like the mouse, and we find him like the cat.

323
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,827
Game on.

324
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:44,136
Okay, we've got Chet's famous, super cheesy scrambled eggs.

325
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,515
And Blanche's famous bacon that spells your name.

326
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,227
Here you go, Britney.

327
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:55,606
Wait, I can't say my name is Britney.

328
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,441
That would be a lie.

329
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:58,818
Yes.

330
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,445
But we aren't "stupposed" to lie.

331
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,239
Don't think of it as lying.

332
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,783
Think of it as high-stakes pretending.

333
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,993
Well, I'm not going to.

334
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,037
Bah, it's just a little white lie.

335
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,955
No.

336
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,999
Agnes, as your father, I command you to lie.

337
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,125
No.

338
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,044
- Yes, lie. - Mm-mmm.

339
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,797
You are walking on thin ice, little lady.

340
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,006
Hmm!

341
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,219
Why can't you be more like your sister Edith?

342
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,012
She lies all the time.

343
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,097
No, I don't.

344
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,474
See? See? She's lying right now.

345
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,309
Beautifully, I might add.

346
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,394
Okay, you guys.

347
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:37,606
This is our first big day in Mayflower, and I say we make it a great one.

348
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,400
Right, Chet Jr?

349
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,528
Whoo-hoo, Mayflower. Yes! Whoo-hoo.

350
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,572
We're gonna be late for karate.

351
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,375
- And you have to get Margo to school. - Ah.

352
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,701
- It's gonna be awesome. - Ugh. Yay.

353
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,328
Hey, you just have to put yourself out there,

354
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:55,124
and I promise Mayflower will love Chet Cunningham.

355
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,668
Well, they're gonna love him just as much as I do.

356
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:02,673
And you, little man, are gonna have so much fun with your daddy today.

357
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,719
Yep, just you and Dada.

358
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,888
Come on, say it. Dada.

359
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,472
Dada.

360
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,437
Gonna be a fun day.

361
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,576
Hup, hup, hup!

362
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,828
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

363
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,122
Buddies.

364
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,832
Okay.

365
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,464
- Thanks a lot, guys. - Ah, ha-ha, buddy.

366
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,966
Check ya.

367
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,512
All right. Thanks, hon.

368
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,931
- Bye. - Bye.

369
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,808
Look, Margo, neighbors.

370
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,101
Hello!

371
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,519
Hmm?

372
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,771
Come on.

373
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,481
You got this, Chet.

374
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,444
I'm your new neighbor, Chet Cunningham.

375
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,363
Uh-huh. Perry Prescott.

376
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:11,617
So, what, uh, brings you to the neighborhood, Chet?

377
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,370
Well, uh...

378
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:18,916
Solar panels. That's it. I sell solar panels.

379
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,669
Have you joined the solar revolution?

380
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,420
Yeah, no.

381
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,339
Uh, I think I'm good.

382
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,507
Good to know.

383
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,342
So, what do you do, Perry?

384
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,469
I own Prescott Motors.

385
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:34,014
The largest auto dealer in the state.

386
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,767
Wow, that's impressive.

387
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,852
This is my daughter Margo.

388
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:39,936
Bree, Dad.

389
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,732
Ah, yes. Yes. Did I say "Margo"?

390
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,734
It's funny, because I was thinking...

391
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:49,530
I was thinking about a fish I once had as a pet, named Margo.

392
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:53,784
Who lived in the pond and then died.

393
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,743
Uh.

394
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:02,209
Anyway, I, uh... I'm about to take Bree to school for her first day.

395
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,129
Yeah, I was about to take Poppy to school, so...

396
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,589
Poppy. Hello, Poppy.

397
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,717
That's a fun name to say.

398
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,385
You want to carpool with us?

399
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:12,970
No.

400
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,097
You could be friends with Bree.

401
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,265
Right, Bree?

402
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,475
You don't have any friends.

403
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,398
Well, love to chitchat, Chet, but she's got school,

404
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,359
and I'm meeting some pals over at the country club, so...

405
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,363
Ooh, country club. That sounds like a lot of fun.

406
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:35,576
If I were ever invited to a country club, I am sure that I would love it.

407
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,873
Yeah, well, we really have to get going, so nice meeting you, Chet.

408
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:48,380
Okay, cool. Any time you want to hang out, just hit me up with a text.

409
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,174
He's gonna text me.

410
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,717
That was painful.

411
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,348
You'll see. By lunchtime,

412
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:02,269
you will have forgotten all about your old, lousy friends.

413
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,563
Mmm, not so sure about that.

414
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,862
Right? Oh, my gosh.

415
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,113
Not my problem, bro.

416
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,784
Hey, honey, you got this.

417
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:17,910
You're smart.

418
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,078
You're funny.

419
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,038
What's there to worry about, right?

420
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,457
They're gonna love you.

421
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,834
Thanks, Gru.

422
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,296
Bye-bye.

423
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,717
Oh, please let them love you.

424
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,011
Ooh!

425
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,307
Hey, Poppy.

426
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,979
Eh...

427
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,234
Come on. Hey. Move it!

428
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:53,529
Sorry. My bad. I'm going. All right.

429
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,905
I'm going.

430
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,659
Ooh, glassos.

431
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,882
No, no, no. Sit. Sit.

432
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,009
No.

433
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,396
All right, gentlemen.

434
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,022
Fall in.

435
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,569
Some of you may be wondering why you're here.

436
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,945
Uh, sí.

437
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:38,740
As you may or may not know, I was recently called out of retirement

438
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,577
to head up the AVL's new top-secret initiative

439
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,246
to take down Maxime Le Mal.

440
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,123
And that's where you come in.

441
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,541
We need volunteers.

442
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,501
Me! Me! Me!

443
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,920
We are looking for the strong, the mighty...

444
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,088
Ooh.

445
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,631
- The fearless. - Uh, nope.

446
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:57,217
We need the best of the best.

447
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:00,179
So, who's it going to be?

448
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,349
Yes, nice work, gentlemen.

449
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:12,107
The AVL is known for cutting-edge weapons and vehicles,

450
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:15,485
but now we are developing cutting-edge agents.

451
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,989
And I can think of no better guinea pigs than you.

452
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,532
Guinea pigs!

453
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:25,412
You will be the first to test our super serum.

454
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,956
Designed to transform you into elite agents

455
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,502
with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.

456
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,215
Or you might just explode.

457
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,758
We don't really know.

458
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,260
Eh? Huh?

459
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,138
Oh, ah.

460
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,389
Hey.

461
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:24,721
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Mega Minions.

462
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,313
Cool.

463
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,816
Aw, you guys look adorable.

464
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,776
And... And really tough and scary.

465
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,238
I'll look even better when I have a black belt. Hi-yah!

466
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,324
Ooh, ooh! I'm gonna break a brick with my head.

467
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,243
That's the spirit. Oh!

468
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,871
Oh, okay. Now, go have fun while I'm at work.

469
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:53,458
- Blair and Britney. Right? - Mmm.

470
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:54,543
We will.

471
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,753
Okay. Bye, Mom.

472
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,046
Bye.

473
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,131
Got ya.

474
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,008
Hi-yah!

475
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,384
Circle up, people.

476
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,180
Show respect for your sensei.

477
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,766
Yes, Sensei O'Sullivan.

478
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,310
Hai!

479
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,276
You, Moscovitch, didn't I tell you to cut that hair?

480
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,153
You look like a sheepdog.

481
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,571
Sorry, Sensei.

482
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:28,076
Now, we have two new students today ready to begin their journey...

483
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,871
Hi-yah! To awesomeness.

484
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,415
You, tiny girl.

485
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,625
Step forward and tell us your name.

486
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,336
Um...

487
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,338
It's Britney.

488
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,758
Uh, m-my name?

489
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,428
I can't.

490
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,889
There's no "can't" in karate.

491
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,600
Ten push-ups after class!

492
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,018
Hey, that's not fair.

493
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,398
Huh! Ha! You better not be talking back to your sensei.

494
00:30:58,482 --> 00:30:59,649
Hi-yah!

495
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:03,570
Now, are you ready to tell us your name and participate?

496
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,279
Mmm.

497
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,908
I guess not.

498
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,953
Then why don't you go sit in the corner of disgrace and reflection

499
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,831
and think about what kind of person you wanna be?

500
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:23,799
Now, am I gonna get any trouble from you?

501
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,550
Yeah, probably.

502
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,094
Excuse me?

503
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,554
If you think I'm above fighting children,

504
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,474
you picked the wrong dojo.

505
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,313
Hi-yah, hi-yah, hi-yah! Hi-yah!

506
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,524
Ha!

507
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,824
Yeah!

508
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,159
That was for my sister.

509
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,874
You broke my pinkie toe.

510
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:02,462
That's gonna be a lot of push-ups.

511
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,632
Okay, then put this over here, then the hair gel.

512
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,759
- Hair spray. - Oh, uh, Mrs. Cunningham?

513
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,261
Oh! Uh, yeah. Hi.

514
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,347
I have to say, this is quite a résumé.

515
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,141
Well, what can I say?

516
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,767
I'm good at what I do.

517
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,728
Well, you are exactly what we need here.

518
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,398
Lot of vain, demanding divas in this town.

519
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,319
I have a hair emergency, people.

520
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,447
Where's what's-her-name?

521
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,031
Remy? Rhonda?

522
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,908
Oh, Melora, I'm so sorry.

523
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,493
Rachel's on maternity leave.

524
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:36,163
What? Oh, that is unacceptable.

525
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:41,084
But you are in luck, because Blanche here is fantastic.

526
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,253
Perfect. I'll be in my chair.

527
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,339
Okay, kiddo, you're up.

528
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:54,181
So, Melora, what are we thinking?

529
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,309
What if we just wet the hair and let it dry in the air?

530
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,936
Let nature do its thang... you know?

531
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,481
No, no, no, no. That style is dead to me.

532
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:05,317
It's-It's time for a whole new Melora.

533
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,611
I want this.

534
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,070
Wow.

535
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,114
Wow. Um...

536
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,660
Okay, let's start with color?

537
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,996
Yes, color. Because that's what you start with.

538
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,625
Little of this.

539
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,835
Some of that.

540
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,921
Ooh, that's pretty.

541
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,004
This isn't so hard.

542
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,674
Uh...

543
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,681
What?

544
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,643
Should it be smoking?

545
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,061
Yes. Uh-huh.

546
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,854
Smoking means it's working.

547
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:52,614
What's going on?

548
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,407
Perfect. No one panic.

549
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,077
Call 911.

550
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,500
Quickly, quickly.

551
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,420
Oh... wonder where they're going.

552
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,636
Voilà! My latest creation.

553
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,557
All of my transformation powers in a handheld design, huh?

554
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,058
Ay! I love it.

555
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,019
Oh, and look at the little antenna. That's so cute.

556
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,355
It's not supposed to be cute. No.

557
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,149
I'm going for intimidating. Terrifying, even.

558
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,445
Now, all I have to do is find that walking boiled potato,

559
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,990
and his baby is mine.

560
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,783
Check this out.

561
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,372
Whoa!

562
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:54,092
No, I kid you not. I'm being serious... Whoa!

563
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:57,387
Whoa!

564
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:14,154
Oh, this is going to be so good.

565
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:29,085
Okay, Daddy is officially exhausted.

566
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,503
I changed your diaper.

567
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:35,008
I've got your bottle, your Binky, and here are your balloons.

568
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,053
There you go. You like those, right?

569
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,639
All right. A little bit of me time.

570
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,979
Ah!

571
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:17,175
Someone put a glitter bomb in my locker. Ugh.

572
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,219
Teenagers are the worst.

573
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,640
Yeah. Babies are no picnic either.

574
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,480
Ah!

575
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,563
Junior!

576
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,581
Ah, okay. Okay.

577
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:51,376
Dua Lipa prosciutto.

578
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,260
Fire in the bowl.

579
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,556
Good night, Ralph.

580
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,569
Hello, Gru.

581
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,572
Hello. Hey! What the...

582
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,702
Oh, hello, Poppy. Did you say something?

583
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,747
Wha... Uh... my name's Chet, by the way.

584
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,290
Chet Cunningham.

585
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,835
Gru? What does that even mean?

586
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,631
It means you're bad at lying.

587
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,425
Hey. That's not nice.

588
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,677
Ever hear of respecting your elders?

589
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,846
I don't respect boomers.

590
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,055
I just mock them.

591
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:50,393
Ah, ha, ha. Is that, like, a joke you read on the Web?

592
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:54,481
Wow. "The Web"? How old are you?

593
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,942
Well, old enough to know that you are a rotten little...

594
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,026
Huh?

595
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,112
You better watch yourself.

596
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,156
Ooh-hoo. Oof.

597
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,658
You used to be a master villain.

598
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:09,954
That's not me. I don't even see a resemblance.

599
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:15,835
Clearly, you have the wrong guy, as I sell, mmm, solar panels.

600
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,671
Oh, don't worry. I'm not gonna expose you.

601
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,673
Because you're gonna help me pull a heist.

602
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,383
We start planning tomorrow.

603
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,386
You want to pull a heist?

604
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,013
Listen, kid, I'm not going to...

605
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,765
No. You listen, old man.

606
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,392
- Ow. - I own you.

607
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:36,189
And I promise, you do not want to cross me.

608
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,316
Okay. All right.

609
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,194
But tomorrow is not really good timing.

610
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,529
Bummer for you.

611
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,864
Because this is happening.

612
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:49,869
Unless you want the whole world to know exactly who you are...

613
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:54,791
Gru.

614
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,378
She is terrifying.

615
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,853
- Ow! - Ooh!

616
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,729
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

617
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,439
Five!

618
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,405
Oh!

619
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,117
Yay!

620
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,702
Aw.

621
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,911
Hey, Jiminy!

622
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,163
No problemo.

623
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:49,095
Oh, phew.

624
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,139
Oy.

625
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,774
All right, all right. Settle down.

626
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,193
Settle down!

627
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,320
Thank you.

628
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,615
It's time to get you out for some real-world training.

629
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,074
Liberty.

630
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:15,705
And, if you do well out there, you'll be the AVL's new secret weapon.

631
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,331
Pomodoro!

632
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,293
Pomodoro!

633
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,378
Ouch.

634
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,512
I'm quite sure I won't regret this.

635
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,849
- No. The painters cancelled. - Uh-huh.

636
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,184
- True story. - Wow.

637
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,187
- I don't know what is the deal with... - Morning, neighbors.

638
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,647
Hey there!

639
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,316
Still waiting on that invite, Perry.

640
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,776
- Ugh. - Oh!

641
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,111
- No. No, no. - Yoo-hoo!

642
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,571
- Patsy! - Oh, neighbors.

643
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:49,530
Oh, Patsy.

644
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,700
Hi there. I'm Perry's wife, Patsy.

645
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,370
Oh! I'm Blanche. And this is Chet.

646
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:59,207
Hi. So, I look over here and I see you...

647
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,085
and I have one of my brilliant ideas.

648
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,295
Perry needs a fourth for tennis tomorrow.

649
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:05,630
Oh, honey.

650
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:09,926
I don't know. He doesn't seem like much of a tennis guy.

651
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:13,221
Much of a tennis guy? I'm too much of a tennis guy.

652
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,847
I'm Mr. Tennis.

653
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:18,309
It's my favorite of all the sports games.

654
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:23,022
With the racket and with the balls. So yellow and fuzzy.

655
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,152
Oh, then we're all set. See you two at the club tomorrow.

656
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,237
Toodle-oo!

657
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,365
Okay. Toodle-oo to you two too.

658
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,951
So, you... you play tennis?

659
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,787
Yes. Yes. I play tennis.

660
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,415
I'm pretty fantastic actually.

661
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,417
Well, at least I was at summer camp.

662
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,545
Wow. That's great. Here you go.

663
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,839
Okay, bye.

664
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,257
Have fun!

665
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,426
There you go.

666
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:54,679
Okay.

667
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,681
Huh?

668
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,064
What the...

669
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,540
Gru.

670
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,543
You can't hide from me, Gru.

671
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,545
Ay! My back is killing me.

672
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,505
How long is this gonna take?

673
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,841
It will take as long as it takes.

674
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:35,136
Mark my words, Gru will not win.

675
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,597
This won't be like the ninth-grade talent show.

676
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,016
Ay, again with this.

677
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,810
Yes, again. It was a pivotal moment.

678
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,395
Why can't you indulge me?

679
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,650
It was the night of the big show.

680
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,737
I had practiced for weeks,

681
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,240
perfecting a number that would blow my classmates away.

682
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,661
I was about to go on when.:

683
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,332
- What? Wh... Oh! - I heard it.

684
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:14,550
There was that little jerk doing my big number.

685
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,555
He ruined everything.

686
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,850
I couldn't go on after him. I would have looked like a fool.

687
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,769
Like I was copying him.

688
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,230
Maybe it was just a coincidence.

689
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,023
That was a very popular song.

690
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,317
Oh, no, no, no, no. He knew.

691
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,944
He did it on purpose.

692
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,405
He reveled in humiliating me. Oh!

693
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,615
What now?

694
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,283
We're low on fuel.

695
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,119
It's always something.

696
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:44,956
Look, I can never focus on just being evil.

697
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,208
Okay. Pull over.

698
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,613
Okay, let's see.

699
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,158
Regular unleaded. Oh.

700
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,368
Wow. It is expensive, no?

701
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:26,330
Okay. Insert card and remove rapidly.

702
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,748
"Card not read"?

703
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:31,085
Oh, come on.

704
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,545
Did you pull it out rapidly?

705
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,964
Yes. Yes. Very rapidly.

706
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,632
Come...

707
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,474
Ay, get me a slushy. It's my cheat day.

708
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:50,688
Hey, you. Your stupid machine won't read my card.

709
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,774
- Did you remove it rapidly? - Yes.

710
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:58,321
Well, sometimes it's too rapid. You should probably try again.

711
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,781
I don't have time for this.

712
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,159
Okay. Whoa!

713
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:07,371
I'm trying to destroy my arch nemesis!

714
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,583
Now, give me 900 gallons on pump four, you idiot.

715
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,169
Whoa! Please, don't hurt me.

716
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,338
Oh, I'm not going to hurt you.

717
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,257
Wha...

718
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,516
Oh! Look at you!

719
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,977
Ha, ha! Much better.

720
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,313
Now, get me a purple slushy!

721
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,400
I'm not paying for that, just so you know. So there.

722
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,653
I know. I'm so bad.

723
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:48,120
Hmm. Okay, why don't you guys pick out a healthy cereal?

724
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:51,207
This is Lucky's favorite cereal.

725
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,335
You don't think he'll forget me?

726
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,878
Do you?

727
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:58,923
Oh, sweetheart, that's impossible.

728
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,676
You play with Lucky and dress him up.

729
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,511
And you guys have your podcast.

730
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:08,599
There is no way in this world he could ever forget his best friend.

731
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:10,685
Thanks, Mom.

732
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:12,937
Oh, lookit!

733
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,898
This one has extra marshmallows.

734
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,608
Double-frosted choco clusters.

735
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,777
- Yeah. - Yeah. Let's go with those.

736
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,071
All right. What else do we need?

737
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,866
Oh, no.

738
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,744
Nobody see. Nobody notice. Nobody notice.

739
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,833
- What's wrong? - Huh?

740
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,919
Oh, nothing. Just, uh... Ooh.

741
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:39,463
Stretching before we hit the aisles.

742
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,383
Shopping is the number one cause of pulled hamstrings.

743
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,135
Huh. You probably didn't know that.

744
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,556
Okay, all stretched. Let's go.

745
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,183
Quickly. Quick, quick, quick.

746
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,602
Okay. Coast is clear...

747
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,231
Oh.

748
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,109
You.

749
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:05,072
You did this to me, you fraud.

750
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,157
Come on, girls.

751
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,700
Clean up on aisle nine!

752
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,661
I've always wanted to say that. Just hide over here.

753
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,497
What does that lady want?

754
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,166
Lady? I didn't see a lady.

755
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,545
Lady!

756
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,047
Come on. Let's go.

757
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:22,548
- Faster! - Whoa!

758
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,842
You're no hairdresser.

759
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,679
I'm on to you! Get back here.

760
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:29,847
I gotta get out of here.

761
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,366
Okay.

762
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,248
Come back here.

763
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,543
Whoa-ho-ho.

764
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,547
Hey! No, no, no, no!

765
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:08,552
- You can't just... - Open, open, open!

766
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:16,768
Whoa!

767
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,187
Let's go!

768
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:24,819
Stop! Come here, you!

769
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,326
Whew. That was a close one.

770
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,662
Always a fun time when you go shopping with Mom.

771
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,957
- Yeah! I feel so alive! - Best shopping trip ever!

772
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,658
Perfecto.

773
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:13,576
Poppy!

774
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,537
Poppy!

775
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,167
I don't see her, Junior.

776
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,793
Look up, genius.

777
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,837
- Huh? - You're late.

778
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,631
How do I get up there?

779
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,133
Use the trampoline.

780
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,551
Huh?

781
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,099
Here we go.

782
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:52,114
Ow, ow, ow, ah, ow!

783
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:06,170
It is I,

784
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:10,674
Poppy Prescott, villainess.

785
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,510
Have a seat, Gru.

786
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:13,802
All right, I'll sit... Ah!

787
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,932
Okay. Why am I here?

788
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:23,020
Because, like you, I was born to be bad.

789
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:27,983
And now, it's time to discuss our big heist.

790
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:30,986
Pfft, heist. Please. You're just a child.

791
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,907
All great villains start young.

792
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:38,285
Didn't you steal the Crown Jewels when you were 12?

793
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:41,038
I was a lot younger than that.

794
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,165
And, no offense, but you're not me.

795
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:46,835
Oh, I plan on being a lot better than you.

796
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,338
Check this out.

797
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,174
Hey, is that my old school?

798
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:53,259
Bingo.

799
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,720
Which I have expertly modeled with glue and Popsicle sticks.

800
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:02,476
And it's where we are going to steal the school mascot.

801
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:04,937
You want to steal Lenny?

802
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,230
Exactly.

803
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,316
Lycée Pas Bon has always been my dream school.

804
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,695
And this heist will look so great on my villain transcripts.

805
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,863
That is a terrible idea.

806
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:17,950
Have you ever even seen a honey badger?

807
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,119
They are vicious little monsters.

808
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:24,123
They literally eat bees and cobras for breakfast.

809
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,292
Honey badger don't care.

810
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,711
No way. No way am I helping you.

811
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,255
Well, that's the thing with blackmail,

812
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,216
you kinda have no choice.

813
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,745
Ha, ha!

814
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,205
Okay.

815
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,335
Oh. Ah. Uh...

816
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:10,586
Tim! Tim.

817
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,296
Go, go, go!

818
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,760
Chihuahua.

819
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,726
No!

820
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,945
Suppository!

821
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:42,117
Give it!

822
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,994
Hey! Police!

823
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:45,287
No problemo!

824
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,421
Ooh.

825
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,006
Uh, piña colada.

826
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,264
Help!

827
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:07,476
Hola.

828
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,103
Please. Can you help me?

829
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,186
Oh, sí, sí.

830
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:20,572
- Ah. - Hey! All is good. Ciao!

831
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:27,121
- Smudge! Smudge, come down. - Hey!

832
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:31,874
El gato.

833
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:35,170
Thank you. Thank you.

834
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,716
Ooh, smooch.

835
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:43,429
Smoochy.

836
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,645
Help!

837
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:54,481
Bazooka!

838
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,875
Ah. Eh.

839
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:19,882
Hey, hey.

840
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:26,597
Yeah!

841
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:41,361
There they are. Those guys crushed my car.

842
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:42,988
They destroyed the coffee shop.

843
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,699
- Yeah! Get outta here! - They're ruining everything.

844
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:48,827
- I'm sick of superheroes. - Yeah! Let's get 'em.

845
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:51,079
- No more superheroes! - Oh, no, no, no!

846
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,249
Get in!

847
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,921
- Boo! - Yeah, get outta here!

848
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,089
Gentlemen...

849
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,883
our experiment has failed.

850
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,844
You are officially going to be retired.

851
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:08,514
Retirement!

852
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:09,765
Uh, no?

853
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,990
Whoa. There it is.

854
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,209
The castle, the gargoyles.

855
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,211
I can't believe I'm really here.

856
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:47,553
Okay.

857
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,809
Okay. Let's get this over with.

858
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,894
- Ron, hand me my gear. - Voilà.

859
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:58,188
- Keep a close eye on him. - Okay.

860
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,690
- If you need anything... - Uh-huh.

861
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,359
I brought formula, extra diapers, his favorite Binky...

862
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,112
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

863
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:15,914
And now, we cut through the glass with my...

864
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:17,791
diapers?

865
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:21,628
What? You've got to be kidding with me.

866
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:22,880
Muerte a la piñata!

867
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,884
Hey, guys. Guys. Guys? Guys!

868
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:29,928
Guys, where is the other bag with my gear?

869
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:31,430
Balloon.

870
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,598
Ah.

871
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,558
Oops.

872
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,812
What? How...

873
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:44,401
All right. All right. Let's see what I got in here. Uh...

874
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,154
Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Aha!

875
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:00,334
Easy-peasy.

876
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,931
Huh?

877
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:20,395
That's Mr. Friendly.

878
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,356
Stupid kids.

879
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:26,443
No, no, no!

880
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,076
Oh, I hate my job.

881
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,369
Whew.

882
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,580
Stupid kids.

883
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,420
Ha-ha-ha.

884
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:53,720
That's Dr. Destructo. He was just a kid.

885
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:56,264
And there is Killer Driller's original helmet.

886
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:57,516
Come on!

887
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,809
Stay focused.

888
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,611
Diaper.

889
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,254
I need something like... Something that I can...

890
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,588
How about this?

891
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,132
Nice.

892
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:34,511
Yes!

893
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:40,225
We're in.

894
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,894
Wait. No, no, no.

895
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:43,979
Baby powder!

896
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,062
Ah, sí, sí.

897
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,112
Whoa!

898
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,740
You know, the most important part of a heist

899
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:58,618
is being constantly aware of potential danger.

900
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,579
Tiramisu!

901
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,416
No. Junior!

902
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,751
Junior, come back here.

903
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:10,672
So, what's your plan now?

904
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:12,924
I am dealing with it.

905
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:17,846
Don't touch anything. No.

906
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:20,557
No, no, no!

907
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:25,729
Good job, Junior. Way to go.

908
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:31,109
Aw, he's having fun.

909
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:32,861
Ugh, too much fun.

910
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:37,741
Please, Junior.

911
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:40,035
Daddy needs to steal a honey badger.

912
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,956
Okay.

913
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,335
I know they keep Lenny here at night.

914
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,171
And, if memory serves,

915
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,633
there is a hidden switch around here somewhere.

916
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,093
Ah! Ha-ha.

917
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:58,970
Yes!

918
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,848
Ooh.

919
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:12,776
I'll hit him with this.

920
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,570
Once he's knocked out, we'll open the cage.

921
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:18,323
That fuzzy demon will sleep like a baby the whole...

922
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,832
Okay. He's still asleep.

923
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:33,004
Mamma mia!

924
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:38,844
I tranked myself.

925
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:47,561
Hey! Hey!

926
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,731
Gru, what do we do?

927
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:53,817
No!

928
01:00:57,696 --> 01:01:00,282
Oh, no! I've ruined our heist.

929
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:05,078
What? Who dares?

930
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,419
Intruders!

931
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,923
Intruders!

932
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,270
Wake up!

933
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,396
No!

934
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,361
What?

935
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,408
Hmm.

936
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:48,079
Aw.

937
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,582
Aw.

938
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:51,791
No. Nope.

939
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,755
Come on. We have to go.

940
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,304
Intruders!

941
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,848
You messed with the wrong principal.

942
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:09,559
Here we go. Come on. Come on.

943
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,150
- Go, go, go! - Go, go, go.

944
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:24,491
Come on! Come on! Ooh, you won't get away with this.

945
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:28,619
Ah!

946
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:49,641
Prepare to feel the wrath of Übelschlecht!

947
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,272
Diaper rash cream.

948
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:56,648
Oh, no. Oh, no!

949
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,400
Stop, stop, stop!

950
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,028
Oh, dear.

951
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,363
Oof!

952
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:05,949
Get back here, you.

953
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,326
I want my Lenny!

954
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,374
How are we getting out of here?

955
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,542
Follow me.

956
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:17,751
Get in!

957
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,257
Come on, come on, come on.

958
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:26,344
Mr. Friendly!

959
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,139
Whoa!

960
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:55,165
I have to say, that was without a doubt the coolest night of my life.

961
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,709
I can't believe we actually pulled that off.

962
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:02,339
Not gonna lie, that was pretty fun.

963
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,051
Thanks, Ron.

964
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,594
Phew.

965
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:11,389
And thank you for everything.

966
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,684
Oh, and hey. Don't worry.

967
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:17,896
Your secret is safe with me, partner.

968
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,356
Thanks.

969
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:20,648
Good night.

970
01:04:23,068 --> 01:04:26,446
Your dada did pretty good, huh, Junior?

971
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,537
Sí, sí, sí. Go, go.

972
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:37,332
Hello, Maxime.

973
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:39,959
How's my favorite student?

974
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:43,755
You know, I think you and I might be looking for the same person.

975
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,925
And I know exactly where he is.

976
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,435
Thank you, Principal Übelschlecht.

977
01:04:57,519 --> 01:04:58,853
We got him.

978
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:01,898
Valentina, to Mayflower.

979
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,234
With pleasure.

980
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,990
Ah, here we go.

981
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:13,952
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

982
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,995
It's all coming back to me.

983
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,624
Oops.

984
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:22,419
- Okay. - See you later.

985
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,671
Say, "Bye, Mommy and Daddy."

986
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,839
Have fun at the club!

987
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,924
Make good choices.

988
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:30,093
- Bye, guys. - Goodbye!

989
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,428
Bye!

990
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:32,804
Hey, Cunninghams.

991
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,014
Um, hey, Poppy.

992
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:38,601
I heard our parents are having a playdate, which is adorable, by the way,

993
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:41,271
and I thought you might wanna hang out.

994
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,398
Oh, yeah. Sure. Come on in.

995
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:46,234
Let's get this party started, people.

996
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,528
I like her.

997
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,989
Yeah. Most people do.

998
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,072
Sweet.

999
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:55,452
So, have you guys ever seen a honey badger?

1000
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:05,044
Whoa, okay, these guys aren't messing around.

1001
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,505
There are my favorite new neighbors.

1002
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:09,174
Hi.

1003
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:11,718
I'm loving this whole vibe.

1004
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,512
You two look like a couple of pros.

1005
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:18,099
Yeah, but we're not.

1006
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:20,768
Perry and the boys are waiting for y'all on the court,

1007
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:23,563
and we are hitting the clubhouse.

1008
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:26,232
And you're telling me where you got that to-die-for outfit.

1009
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,779
- Ah! - Ugh.

1010
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,157
Over here, Chet.

1011
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,283
Hello.

1012
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,660
Okay.

1013
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:39,454
Skip, Chip, Chet.

1014
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:40,580
Chet, Skip, Chip.

1015
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,706
Hey there, fellas.

1016
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,374
- Hello. - How are you doing, Chet?

1017
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:45,293
Okay.

1018
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:48,755
Chet here is gonna show us fellas how it's done.

1019
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:50,924
Right?

1020
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,676
Um.

1021
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,013
I'm gonna smoke this guy.

1022
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,515
Okay.

1023
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:07,732
Huh?

1024
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,735
What the...

1025
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,868
Okay, let's do this.

1026
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,792
Huh? You've gotta be kidding.

1027
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,671
Okay, okay.

1028
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:31,213
Better?

1029
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:38,388
What?

1030
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,057
That doesn't count.

1031
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,350
And...

1032
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:44,936
What? You can't just j... Hey!

1033
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,730
This is ridiculous!

1034
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,738
Burrito.

1035
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:03,997
Thanks, Ron.

1036
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,291
Hey, no! Oh, no.

1037
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,419
Come and get it.

1038
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:11,588
- Aw, he's so cute. - Whoa!

1039
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:15,216
This is the weirdest dog ever.

1040
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,467
I'll get it.

1041
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:30,189
Well, hello, little one. Is your daddy home?

1042
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:33,985
Sorry. I'm not "stupposed" to talk to strangers.

1043
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:36,779
Oh, I'm not a stranger.

1044
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:39,699
Well, you look strange to me.

1045
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:42,201
Who is it?

1046
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,078
I don't know.

1047
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:48,041
But she's old and smells like pickles.

1048
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:53,713
Okay, I'm coming.

1049
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:58,593
Oh, no. Oh.

1050
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:00,845
I'll be right back.

1051
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:04,474
Can I help you?

1052
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,059
Well, I hope so.

1053
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,436
I'm an old friend of Gru's.

1054
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:11,856
Well, he's not here, so...

1055
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,192
Oh, that's all right.

1056
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:16,569
I'll wait.

1057
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,450
What? No.

1058
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,703
Whenever you're ready, Perry.

1059
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:28,789
Hmm?

1060
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:36,756
Needless to say,

1061
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:41,260
Perry and I are no longer welcome on the island of Oahu.

1062
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:43,721
True story.

1063
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:45,473
- Honey! - Oh, thank goodness.

1064
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,892
It's the children. We have to go now.

1065
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,105
Thanks. Bye.

1066
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,232
- Our cover's blown! - What?

1067
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:56,275
- Call Silas! - Oh, no.

1068
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,727
Ah.

1069
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,855
Gru's been compromised.

1070
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:35,815
This is an emergency, people.

1071
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,109
Retirement is officially over.

1072
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:40,528
Assemble the Mega Minions.

1073
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:49,829
Oh!

1074
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,582
Pomodoro!

1075
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,209
Mmm.

1076
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:00,548
Ah! Pomodoro!

1077
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:15,062
Hey.

1078
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:17,356
Busy bee.

1079
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:19,567
Aw.

1080
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:22,570
Pomodoro!

1081
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:27,992
Yeehaw.

1082
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:31,037
Pomodoro!

1083
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:36,209
Pomodoro! Yeehaw!

1084
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:41,589
Huh?

1085
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:44,675
Whoa! Ha-ha! Yeah!

1086
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,520
So...

1087
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:58,272
your father has been naughty.

1088
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:00,691
Very naughty.

1089
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,904
He took something of mine that I desperately want back.

1090
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:07,448
- Ah! - Ha!

1091
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:11,285
Principal Übelschlecht?

1092
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:15,414
Ooh! I know you took my Lenny.

1093
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:17,124
- Now hand him over. - Ah! Ow!

1094
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:20,002
That's actually a very funny story.

1095
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:21,087
Zip it.

1096
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:24,215
I don't wanna hear your excuses. I'm here to teach you a lesson.

1097
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:25,299
Let's go, tough guy.

1098
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:28,803
Okay. Okay. I'm not going to fight an old lady.

1099
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,054
Oh, yeah?

1100
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:33,015
Well, I'm gonna give you a whupping for the history books.

1101
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:34,433
Whoa! Whoa!

1102
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:38,771
Take that.

1103
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:44,861
Yeah! Go!

1104
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:47,405
Girls, look out! Over here!

1105
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:49,282
Everyone, get down!

1106
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:52,618
Hey, back off, lady!

1107
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:55,913
Ow!

1108
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:04,922
Stop it!

1109
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:06,549
Let him go!

1110
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:07,717
Take that!

1111
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:19,687
Now we have to get in there and find that baby.

1112
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:20,855
What?

1113
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:26,068
Oh, jackpot, huh?

1114
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,905
Ay, Maxime. This is too easy.

1115
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,616
Come here, little bébé.

1116
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:33,117
Come to Maxime.

1117
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,202
Yes. Coochy, coochy...

1118
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:37,288
- Oh! - Ay, Maxime.

1119
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:38,371
You little...

1120
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,250
You are in big trouble.

1121
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:43,419
Gotcha!

1122
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:47,173
Hi-yah!

1123
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,389
Whew.

1124
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:56,807
Wait. Where's the baby?

1125
01:13:56,891 --> 01:13:58,643
Where's the baby?

1126
01:13:58,726 --> 01:14:00,394
Junior?

1127
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:05,608
Lucy!

1128
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:06,901
Go after the baby.

1129
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:10,780
Maxime.

1130
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,657
Say au revoir, Gru.

1131
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,075
Oh, and don't worry.

1132
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:17,203
He will be very happy with his new daddy.

1133
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:20,748
Right? Look at him. Oh, he loves his new daddy.

1134
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:22,249
Junior!

1135
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:25,962
No!

1136
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:31,258
Get in.

1137
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,970
We've got a baby to save.

1138
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,771
We got him!

1139
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:47,358
Oh, ho. Who is ready to become a little roach?

1140
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:49,485
Let go!

1141
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:51,487
Those are very sensitive. Ah!

1142
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,947
You squirmy little...

1143
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,030
Oh!

1144
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:57,118
Oh! Are you kidding me?

1145
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,662
You got pee-pee all over my ship.

1146
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:02,707
Valentina!

1147
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:05,042
Bring me the Roachification Ray!

1148
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,630
There they are.

1149
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:13,299
I'm on it.

1150
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:15,594
Here we go.

1151
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:24,061
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1152
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:29,608
Mmm.

1153
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,445
What's that? Oh!

1154
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,739
Uh. Hello.

1155
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:36,574
Ugh. Gru!

1156
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:38,200
Get me closer!

1157
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,538
Almost there.

1158
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,082
Take them out!

1159
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:59,180
You're doing great.

1160
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:06,145
Go get 'em, partner.

1161
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,289
Ay! I can't see!

1162
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,264
Junior!

1163
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:45,434
Don't worry, Gru.

1164
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:47,186
The baby is fine.

1165
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,979
See for yourself.

1166
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,484
Oh, Junior.

1167
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:55,653
And now he belongs to me.

1168
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:58,322
Isn't that right, Maxime Jr?

1169
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,367
Together we will wreak havoc,

1170
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,618
cause mayhem,

1171
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:04,870
and have so much fun doing it, huh?

1172
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:09,125
And best of all, he hates you!

1173
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,459
He really does.

1174
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:12,503
Let my son go!

1175
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:14,213
No, I don't think so.

1176
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,715
The fun is just about to start, huh?

1177
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:30,062
Oh! Look at what a coward your old daddy is, huh?

1178
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:59,258
You crossed the line, Maxime.

1179
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,010
Now, give me my son.

1180
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:02,261
I told you.

1181
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:04,221
He is my son now.

1182
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,151
Watch your step, Gru.

1183
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,444
It's a doozy!

1184
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,447
Too bad you can't fly, huh?

1185
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:29,997
- Let go! - Ow! Ugh!

1186
01:18:38,589 --> 01:18:40,007
Oh!

1187
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:42,718
This ends now!

1188
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:46,513
Say goodbye to Daddy.

1189
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,270
It's okay, Junior.

1190
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:55,397
Dada loves you.

1191
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:17,169
Oh!

1192
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:21,548
Get back here.

1193
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:22,716
Bad baby.

1194
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,218
Ow, ow, ow! Ow!

1195
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:25,970
Get off me, you demon.

1196
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:29,181
You're going to feel the wrath of...

1197
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:41,527
Whoa.

1198
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:44,863
Ow! Oh.

1199
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:54,540
See? Not a scratch.

1200
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,166
Huh? What?

1201
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,919
Salami!

1202
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,048
Pastrami!

1203
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,552
No, no, no, no, no.

1204
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:11,974
- What? - Prosciutto!

1205
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:13,976
Ew! Ew! Ew! Gross!

1206
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:20,065
Ha! Nice try. When I...

1207
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:26,030
Antipasti.

1208
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,159
Ho, ho!

1209
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:33,911
- Gru. - Gru!

1210
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:35,247
- Yeah, yeah! - Junior!

1211
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:36,749
Woo!

1212
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:41,086
Yes!

1213
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,379
- Yippee! - Holy cow!

1214
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:44,256
- You guys okay? - That was insane!

1215
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:50,220
Dada.

1216
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:54,516
Mmm.

1217
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,435
Aw!

1218
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:59,355
- Oh, my boys. - Dada.

1219
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:01,106
You know something?

1220
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:06,070
Today has been a real roller coaster of emotion.

1221
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:10,949
Uh, Gru?

1222
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:12,868
Can we go back home now?

1223
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:20,000
All right. There you go.

1224
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:22,002
Yay.

1225
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:23,545
Thanks, Dr. Nefario.

1226
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:25,547
Good as new.

1227
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:27,049
No job too small,

1228
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,176
or too mad.

1229
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,011
Bye, then.

1230
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:32,137
Bye.

1231
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:42,356
Hey. You okay, sweetie?

1232
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,860
Agnes, someone's here to see you!

1233
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:56,620
Lucky?

1234
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:01,959
Lucky!

1235
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:07,631
Did you practice your tricks?

1236
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:09,591
Okay. Play dead.

1237
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:16,140
Yay!

1238
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:20,018
- Ah, that was disturbing. - Yeah, little bit.

1239
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:21,895
Lucky.

1240
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:26,108
Hey, I'll, uh... I'll be back soon.

1241
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,609
Oh, okay.

1242
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:30,154
- There's something I need to take care of. - Yeah.

1243
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:32,197
See you later, buddy.

1244
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:33,824
Love you, honey.

1245
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:43,876
Oh, how you doing, Maxime?

1246
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:46,336
Ugh, what are you doing here, Gru?

1247
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:47,963
You came to gloat? No?

1248
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:49,673
Gloat? No, no, no, no. I just...

1249
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:52,509
I wanted to get something off my chest.

1250
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:55,762
And it concerns the ninth-grade talent show.

1251
01:22:56,763 --> 01:22:57,764
Well,

1252
01:22:58,515 --> 01:22:59,516
actually,

1253
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,936
I did steal your song.

1254
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,980
What? I knew it!

1255
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:07,983
I knew there was no coincidence. You little liar!

1256
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:10,819
Well?

1257
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:11,778
Well, what?

1258
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:13,864
- Well, where's my apology? - Apolo...

1259
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:17,034
What are you talking about? I just apologized.

1260
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:18,410
Oh, no, no, no.

1261
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,370
No, that was no apology.

1262
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:22,456
You just wanted to rub it in.

1263
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:25,334
- I can't believe you stole my song! - Hey!

1264
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:29,880
I only did that to get back at you for pantsing me at the homecoming dance.

1265
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:33,217
Besides, you could've gone on after me.

1266
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,220
It is not my fault that you were afraid.

1267
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:39,181
Afraid because I killed it!

1268
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:40,682
Afraid? Ha!

1269
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:44,895
I could outsing you any day of the week and all day Sunday.

1270
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:47,523
I'd like to see that.

1271
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:49,650
Anytime, anyplace.

1272
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:51,860
You name it, mon ami

1273
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:03,539
Oh, yeah.

1274
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:17,843
Oh, come on.

1275
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:35,529
- Yes! - Whoo! Yeah!

1276
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:45,455
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.

1277
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:49,668
Let's boogie!

1278
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:54,423
Whoo-hoo!

1279
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:16,296
Oh, yeah!

1280
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:45,826
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1281
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:57,963
Oh, strudel.

1282
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,696
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1283
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:51,725
Ah, whoops.

1284
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:25,801
Huh?

1285
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:29,763
Mmm.

1286
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:51,284
No, no, no, no, no.

1287
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:54,913
Ooh!

1288
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:07,634
Uh...

1289
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:09,386
Uh-oh.

1290
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:10,637
Ugh.

1291
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:54,055
Oh?

1292
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:13,343
Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah.
