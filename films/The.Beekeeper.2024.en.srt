1
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,381
That's them in there
just like that?

2
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,842
Just like that.

3
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,095
I wouldn't go in there
for a day or two.

4
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,765
Heard the expression
kick the hornet's nest?

5
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,808
I'll stay right here.
Thank you.

6
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,019
Those things
scare me to death.

7
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,562
They been killing
my honey bees.

8
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,940
A few days unchecked,

9
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,399
they'll wipe out
the whole colony.

10
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,193
What are you gonna
do with them?

11
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,486
Well, that's between
me and them,

12
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,612
if you don't mind.

13
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,864
That's okay.

14
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,116
I understand these things.

15
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,329
I just wanted to thank you

16
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,249
for putting up with me,

17
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,335
and all of my bees.

18
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,129
This place was crabgrass
and weeds,

19
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,506
and you brought it
back to life.

20
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,800
You're a blessing.

21
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,303
No one's ever
taken care of me before.

22
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,227
I'll, uh...

23
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,772
Mr. Clay...

24
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,194
Come back at suppertime.
Let me feed you.

25
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,014
Boss.

26
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,515
-You got something, yeah?
-I got one.

27
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,309
I want it. I need it.

28
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,393
Hey, put it in my ear.

29
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,646
Get this fucking
hippie shit down, please.

30
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,442
United Data Group.
Good afternoon. This is Boyd.

31
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,568
How may I help you?

32
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,153
Boyd.

33
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,572
Uh, hello.
I just got a message saying

34
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,574
that there's a problem
with my computer.

35
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,368
Don't you worry.
The message you received

36
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,578
is from our United Data Group
antivirus software.

37
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,163
It's part of
the software package

38
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,373
that you pre-installed
on your computer.

39
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,958
I'm sorry.
I'm not a computer person.

40
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,086
What did you say the name
of your product is again?

41
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,387
Now, our records show
that you actually

42
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,263
have an older version
on your account.

43
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,974
So what I'm going to need you
to do is uninstall that

44
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,726
and install
the latest version.

45
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,561
Well, I have no idea
how to do that.

46
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,230
My daughter set up
everything for me.

47
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,773
Well, I would recommend

48
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,191
you take your computer
to an IT specialist.

49
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,692
However, keep in mind

50
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,778
that you will lose
all your data,

51
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,114
since they'll have to replace
the hard drive.

52
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,908
I'm pretty remote out here.

53
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,829
Everything I have
is on the computer.

54
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,372
Okay. There is actually

55
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,124
a software package
that you can download

56
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,459
that would allow me
to reinstall remotely.

57
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,504
All right.
Tell me what to do.

58
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,382
It's okay. Can you, uh,
can you type this,

59
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,427
Friendly friend dot net?

60
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,137
Spelled just how it sounds.

61
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,098
Okay. I'm there.

62
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,766
And there should be a button

63
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,268
on your screen
that says "install."

64
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,394
Can you click on that button?

65
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,770
I clicked the button.

66
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,230
So you're about
to see some windows

67
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,857
open, close on your desktop,

68
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,984
as I reinstall
the virus shield for you.

69
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,070
Okay.

70
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,072
I hope you fucking clowns
are paying attention.

71
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,282
You stick to the script,

72
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,953
but not so much that you sound
like a goddamn robot.

73
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,163
All right?

74
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,915
She has got
10K checking,

75
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,751
life insurance annuity,
Roth IRA,

76
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,044
teacher's pension and...

77
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,755
Holy fucking shit!

78
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,507
All right.

79
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,634
She is a signatory

80
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,721
on a $2 million dollar
account.

81
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,891
Some, uh...
It's some fucking charity.

82
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:58,352
All right, kids,
let the strip mining begin.

83
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,023
Ooh.
My computer's going crazy.

84
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,483
Totally normal.

85
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,859
Just do not touch
your keyboard.

86
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,910
Because of this inconvenience,

87
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,495
I'm going to credit back
your subscription fees.

88
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,787
How about that?

89
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,748
I've gone ahead
and deposited $500

90
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,750
into the account ending 020.

91
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,960
Oh, that's not my account.

92
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,795
That's an account
that I manage.

93
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,172
Can you log into that account

94
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,090
and verify the transfer,
please, Miss Parker?

95
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,552
Just hold on.

96
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,804
Yes, there's...

97
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,100
There's a transfer
for $50,000?

98
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,939
Set the hook with sympathy.

99
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,690
Miss Parker, I...

100
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,943
I made a terrible mistake.

101
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,486
I was supposed
to credit you 500,

102
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,404
but I don't know,
I got a stuck key here.

103
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,782
I'm gonna lose my job here.

104
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,535
I got kids.

105
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,911
I ain't got fucking kids.

106
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,915
Oh, I don't want you
to get in trouble, but...

107
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,127
I could wire the amount back.

108
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,923
I will need
a different password though.

109
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,049
One second.

110
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,553
This is the master password
for all her accounts.

111
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,724
Okay, so the second we get it,
we zero out everything.

112
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,726
Um...

113
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,106
You know, I, um...

114
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,193
I think
I should call the bank. Hm?

115
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,861
You know what?
You're probably right.

116
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,489
But there goes my job,

117
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,867
and there goes all your data.

118
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:47,253
All my kids' pictures
are on this computer.

119
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,216
Okay.

120
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,764
Boom! Fucking yes!

121
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,392
That is what
I am talking about! Come on!

122
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,563
Let me fucking hear it!
I fucking love you people!

123
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,939
I fucking love you!

124
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,361
Hello?

125
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,322
Hello? You still there?

126
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,165
Uh-oh.

127
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,587
Oh.

128
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,886
Oh.

129
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,656
What did I do?

130
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,492
Stupid...

131
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,326
Mrs. Parker?

132
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,436
Don't move.

133
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,480
Don't you fucking move.

134
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,357
Drop the knife.

135
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,529
Hands behind your back.

136
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,369
Slowly get on your knees
one knee at a time.

137
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,462
Now, who the fuck are you...

138
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,547
...and what are you doing
in my mother's house?

139
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,968
Verona...

140
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,804
I'm so sorry.

141
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,806
How do you know my...

142
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,437
Mom.

143
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,403
Until we can clear him,
he's our best and only perp.

144
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,780
Clear him?

145
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,198
Agent Parker,
I know that's your mother.

146
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,282
I understand.

147
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,786
But there's a world where
she committed suicide.

148
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,709
Suicide? You can't be serious.

149
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,379
That woman loved life
more than anybody I know.

150
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,632
But by all means,
let's just completely ignore

151
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,842
the big white dude
in her house with a knife.

152
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,968
Get him up.

153
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,678
Come on.

154
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,267
It's Clay, right?

155
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,894
Adam Clay?

156
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,021
I don't have much to say.

157
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,898
Mr. Clay, we just got
a couple of questions.

158
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,274
Like, what the fuck
were you doing

159
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,651
in my mother's house?

160
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,278
I was bringing her
a jar of honey.

161
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,031
A jar of honey.

162
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,325
Who the fuck are you?
Winnie-the-Pooh?

163
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,244
I keep bees.

164
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,455
How do you know my mother?

165
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,291
I rent some space
in the barn from her.

166
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,460
I have a signed lease.

167
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,631
But what the fuck
were you doing in her house?

168
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,385
She didn't answer
when I knocked.

169
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,886
I noted her car
in the driveway.

170
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,222
I heard the smoke alarm
and I entered.

171
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,015
You "noted"?

172
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,101
You got a law enforcement
background?

173
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,812
I told you,
I take care of bees.

174
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,442
Oh, my God.

175
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,217
His hands tested
negative for gunshot residue.

176
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,678
But the prints on the gun
were your mother's.

177
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,806
It seems, sadly,
it was suicide.

178
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,737
Mr. Clay, I need to apologize
for last night.

179
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,282
I realize I may have been
a little aggressive.

180
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,329
That's understandable.

181
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,210
Could I interest you
in something a bit stronger?

182
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,755
No.

183
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,758
But I'll sit with you
if you like.

184
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,975
No, thank you.

185
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,563
I wanted to thank you

186
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,358
for taking care of my mom.

187
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,988
I tried to stay in her life
as much as I could.

188
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,572
Obviously, I could have
done a better job.

189
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,369
Being old
can be a lonely thing.

190
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,958
Turn a certain age, you cease
to exist. Cease to matter.

191
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,503
Used to be a part of life,
of the family.

192
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,297
Part of the hive,
I guess you could say.

193
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,885
There's some British Isles
hiding in your accent.

194
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,848
I was born there.

195
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,728
I hated that she was
out here alone.

196
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,814
She wouldn't leave.

197
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,277
There's too many memories.

198
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,824
You know, I think I know
why she liked you.

199
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,951
You're just like my brother.

200
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,413
He was in MARSOC,
a Marine Raider.

201
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,000
He was killed
a few years ago kicking doors.

202
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,879
She loved him.

203
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,339
He'd mow the lawn

204
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,009
and you'd think
he invented fire.

205
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,511
You know, while I graduated
the FBI Academy

206
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,764
and she said,
"Oh, that's nice."

207
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,018
She got scammed.

208
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,022
Somebody emptied out
all her accounts,

209
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,775
her savings, her retirement.

210
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,819
Got every penny.
Maxed out all her cards.

211
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,613
She was an educator,

212
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,698
director of a charity
for kids.

213
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,451
They got two million
out of that account.

214
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,622
You know who did it?

215
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,499
I talked to an agent
in our cyber-crimes office.

216
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,709
This crew's been operating
for two years

217
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,002
and we don't even have names.

218
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,379
And even if we did, good luck
building an indictment

219
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,672
that would stand up in court.

220
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,133
Some defense attorney
would just argue that

221
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,385
the elderly victim agreed

222
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,805
to wire a complete stranger
his entire life savings.

223
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,182
Taking from an elderly person

224
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,934
is as bad as stealing
from a child.

225
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,062
Maybe worse.

226
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,897
Someone hurts a child,

227
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,399
there are parents.

228
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,152
People who care,
ready to step in.

229
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,447
Someone hurts
an older person...

230
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,119
sometimes they're left to face
the hornets alone.

231
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,248
Because either
it goes unnoticed...

232
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,085
or no one cares.

233
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,838
I care.

234
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,841
And I'm stubborn.

235
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,343
And so help me God,

236
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,804
I'm going to get these
motherfuckers who did this.

237
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,562
I need to take care
of the hive.

238
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,899
You've been up all night.

239
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,485
The hive
is more important.

240
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,587
What are you doing?

241
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,755
-I thought you retired.
-I did.

242
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,008
I need a favor.

243
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,759
What kind of favor?

244
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,095
A name and address.

245
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,223
-Easy.
-Not easy.

246
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,518
Even the FBI can't
find these people.

247
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,188
Well, we're not the FBI,
are we?

248
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,898
Shoot me the deets
and stand by.

249
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,822
Yeah.

250
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,324
You weren't kidding.
This one kicked my butt.

251
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,284
They're routing
all over the world.

252
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,493
But you found them?

253
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,579
Sure.
But who are these people?

254
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,706
I'm gonna find out.

255
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,755
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

256
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,048
The hell you think
you're going, pal?

257
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,383
This United Data Group?

258
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,093
Don't know nothing about that.

259
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,679
This is private property,
and you're trespassing.

260
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,306
I'm going inside.

261
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,600
I'm going to burn it down.

262
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,186
Yeah, that's not happening,
buddy.

263
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,562
You're not going
any-fucking-where

264
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,731
except right the fuck back
the way you came.

265
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,566
Do you know what they do here?

266
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,110
Buddy, I'm counting to three.

267
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,821
One, two, three.

268
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,740
There. I did it for you.

269
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,453
You aware
this is a criminal outfit?

270
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,872
Scamming the weakest
in our society.

271
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,041
Stealing everything they have.

272
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,210
Do you know
that's who you work for?

273
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,849
I'm looking
for the call center.

274
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,393
Yeah,
you're in the right place.

275
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,186
You just have to sign in here.

276
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,526
Tell any other companies
in the building

277
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,610
to evacuate now.

278
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,114
-There's going to be a fire.
-Okay. Th...

279
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,156
Thanks.

280
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,288
Hang up the phone.

281
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,164
Nah, I'm good, buddy.
I'm just doing my thing here.

282
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,626
Hang up the phone.

283
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,714
Uh, Miss Perkins, so sorry,
I'll have to

284
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,507
-call you right back.
-Everyone...

285
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,885
I need your attention, please.

286
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,679
Repeat after me.

287
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,807
I will never steal
from the weak

288
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,058
and the vulnerable again.

289
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,396
I sent you
a department download,

290
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,064
and we'll find out
what's going on...

291
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,038
Repeat after me.

292
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,999
I will never steal
from the weak

293
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,500
and the vulnerable again.

294
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,336
I will never steal
from the weak

295
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,879
and the vulnerable again.

296
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,342
To help you keep that promise,

297
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,303
I'm gonna burn this place
to the ground.

298
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,058
Might be a good time
to go home.

299
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,393
Oh, my God!

300
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,228
-It's gas!
-Fucking psycho.

301
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,231
It's gas!

302
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,984
It's gas! It's gas!

303
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,365
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

304
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,617
What the fuck, bro?

305
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,036
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

306
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,496
I'm a beekeeper.

307
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,915
I protect the hive.

308
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,335
Sometimes I use fire
to smoke out hornets.

309
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,838
This a multi-million dollar
operation, asshole.

310
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,507
Okay, so you can't
come up here,

311
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,092
white-knighting shit.

312
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,098
Will you stomp
his ass out, please?

313
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,865
I got it. You fucking get him.

314
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,201
You fucking get him!

315
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,838
Bet you feel
really proud of yourself.

316
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,027
Mister...?

317
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,779
Uh...

318
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,073
-Uh, uh, Garnett.
-Mr. Garnett.

319
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,952
I don't care if your friends
here live or die.

320
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,747
The next call
from your little phishing scam

321
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,040
to this call center

322
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,209
will make a spark
across these wires.

323
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,712
Given all of
the gasoline fumes in here,

324
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,548
I promise you...

325
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,385
anything alive in here
won't be.

326
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,684
Uh, guys,
we might want to dip out.

327
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,754
Hey. What's going on?

328
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:10,467
Uh, let me get flat white,
oat milk, of course,

329
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,385
and, uh,
extra shot of espresso.

330
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,637
-Of course, sir.
-Thank you.

331
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,933
Good morning. Did we get
the otoro and the uni in?

332
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,684
-Yes, sure.
-We did?

333
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,561
-Yes.
-Fucking finally. Great.

334
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,358
-Hey, Michaela.
-Yes.

335
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,860
It... it came back.
The whole thing. Yeah.

336
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,779
And it's like I can barely
fucking move.

337
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,906
It's all tweaked.

338
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,201
-Oh, those are nice.
-Mmm-hmm.

339
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,078
-Those the new bowls?
-Yeah.

340
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,790
-That's perfect. Thank you.
-Mmm-hmm.

341
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,713
What? I'm in a meeting.

342
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,673
You said
hit me on voice

343
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,007
if there's an emergency.

344
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,510
Okay. Right. Well, uh...

345
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,556
It seems we had
a disgruntled customer.

346
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,601
Uh, I just can't comprehend
why you're bothering me.

347
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,228
Just get in touch
with the attorney

348
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,396
and start shoving back.

349
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:08,400
Well, yeah, I don't think
that legal's gonna help much.

350
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,902
Okay, tell me what the fuck
is going on right now.

351
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,363
This dude just strolls in

352
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,574
saying we're stealing
from people,

353
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,285
and he just tears through
all my security guys,

354
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:21,746
like, fucking tissue paper
and, um...

355
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,831
And what?

356
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,375
And he burns the place
to the ground.

357
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,961
Yeah. The call center is gone.

358
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,548
I'm standing here staring
at a $30 million building,

359
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,634
it's now
a giant fucking ashtray.

360
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,220
Four people didn't get out.

361
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,555
You're telling me
that this asshole

362
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,764
burnt the entire building down

363
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,224
and dropped
four fucking bodies?

364
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,852
Yeah, that's not exactly
a disgruntled customer, is it?

365
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,353
Who did this?
Give me a name right now.

366
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,188
Sir, I don't have it.

367
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,525
All the cameras and the drives
burned up in the fire.

368
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,860
He had a hat.

369
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,404
Oh, he had a hat. Okay.

370
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,614
I'm gonna hit you back.
All right?

371
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,115
I got to go big-dog this shit
for a minute.

372
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,832
-Hey, I need to talk to you.
-About what?

373
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,459
What? What? No, nothing.

374
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,337
I mean, if I had a friend
who, like, had a call center

375
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,714
and someone burned it down,
maybe killed some people,

376
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,507
you could get him, right?

377
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,301
Get him?

378
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,552
Yeah,
like disappear the problem.

379
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,263
Come on.

380
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,640
I'll be an hour.

381
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,850
That's way above my pay grade.

382
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,477
You literally ran the CIA,

383
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,062
and you're telling me
you can't just find

384
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,355
some guy in Massachusetts?

385
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,231
Listen, this sounds
like a job for the police.

386
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,941
I just need a name.

387
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,735
Well, you won't get it
from me.

388
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,738
And you keep me
a million miles away

389
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,198
from your metaverse meth lab

390
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,240
or whatever it is.

391
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,077
Yup.

392
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,411
So check it out.

393
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,038
Daddy can't hold your hand
on this one.

394
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,916
Uh, this is clearly some kind
of crime of passion,

395
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,042
spur of the moment,

396
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,835
someone snapped,
like, whatever.

397
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,170
But, uh,
what we're going to do is

398
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,421
I'm going to send you
some credentials,

399
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,923
you're going
to log into our cloud

400
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,383
and you're going
to look at anyone connected

401
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,842
to the last few deals
you closed. All right?

402
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,427
Just, I don't know,
start there.

403
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,055
And, like,
what if I find this guy?

404
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,139
Then what?

405
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,141
You get a wrecking crew
together

406
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,559
and you go Goodfellas
on him.

407
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,852
I mean, come on,
you're a connected guy, right?

408
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,270
Do you understand?

409
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,316
Yeah. No, I understand.
I, uh...

410
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,901
I'll get it done.

411
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,460
It's called a day off.

412
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,587
V, you good?

413
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,548
Yeah, I'm great. Why?

414
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,175
I mean, you did
lose your mother yesterday.

415
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,430
Yeah.

416
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,726
What do you want, Wiley?

417
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,394
Are you leaving?
Please don't go.

418
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,521
I'm going to yoga.

419
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,315
Remember United Data Group?

420
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:58,737
Go on.

421
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,655
You sober enough to drive?

422
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,910
Yeah.

423
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,166
Give us a few seconds,
thank you.

424
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,003
Where's mine?

425
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,337
It's an old cup from my car

426
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,131
with instant
and gas station hot water.

427
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,215
Ew.

428
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,508
-You want a sip?
-No.

429
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,846
So the fire fried
all the CCTV footage.

430
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,141
Receptionist said she saw
some jacked dude in his 40s,

431
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,768
manhandled security
and walked in

432
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:30,852
with a couple gas cans.

433
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,189
This clown car saw everything,
but no one's talking.

434
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,233
They're all frequent fliers
with perjury,

435
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,611
fraud and cyber BeEFs.

436
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,822
Fucking scumbags.
I want IDs on all of them.

437
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,619
You know, this is just the tip
of, like, 20 spears, right?

438
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,538
Can I just have this moment?

439
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,597
Eloise Parker.

440
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,141
Yeah, I took her for over
two million yesterday.

441
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,560
She's, uh... she's Black,

442
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,687
widow, just has a daughter
in Boston.

443
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,981
I don't think this is it,
but, you know.

444
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,861
You said your boy
has an old-ass pickup truck.

445
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,697
That's him.

446
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,293
What the hell are those?

447
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,088
Fucking beehives.

448
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,215
Yeah, dickhead was talking
about them.

449
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,968
I guess he's a, like,
bee lover.

450
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,554
You know what?

451
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,932
He breaks my shit,
you break his shit.

452
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,315
Where you at, bee boy?

453
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,277
You fucking hiding, bitch?

454
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,238
Come out and fucking face us!

455
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,457
Bye, bitch, now!

456
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,500
Let's go!

457
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,028
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

458
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,781
Can someone,
like, fucking help me?

459
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,119
Fuck.

460
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,162
No! I'm okay.

461
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,001
We can talk about this.

462
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,127
We can talk about this.

463
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,795
Let's just work this out,
me and you. We can fix...

464
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,881
No, no!

465
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,094
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

466
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:48,234
So, help me understand
because I'm a little confused.

467
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,736
What's the nature
of your business?

468
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,863
Don't know nothing
about no business.

469
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,740
So then why are people
just wiring you

470
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,199
their entire life savings?

471
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,785
Must be
your winning personality.

472
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,911
They got us lawyers,

473
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,038
so maybe
you want to talk to them.

474
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,833
You know, this is a really
nice shirt, by the way.

475
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,877
Did you steal it out
of a casket, you dog fucker?

476
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,962
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh...

477
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,505
Verona, if you're done
shitting all over

478
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,049
this gentleman's civil rights,

479
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,759
can I speak to you
for a moment?

480
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,386
That's a nice shirt.

481
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,766
-V.
-Yeah, I know. I know.

482
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,393
I'm an asshole.

483
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,229
Oh, so you like fires?

484
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,856
Yeah, today I do.

485
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,650
Good, 'cause, uh,
today's your lucky day.

486
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,278
'Cause apparently,
your mother's house

487
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,280
is on fire, too,
and some other shit.

488
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,907
-Let's go.
-Wait. What?

489
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,326
Yeah. Shit's on fire.
Let's go.

490
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,885
You good?

491
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,012
V, you okay?

492
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,057
Yeah.

493
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,811
-That's a new one.
-Jesus Christ.

494
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,146
Where's Maggie?
Hey, Maggie, ID?

495
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,778
-United Data Group.
-Well, he's handsome.

496
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,905
Thank you.

497
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,325
Are you okay?

498
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,327
Yeah, Wiley, I'm good.
I'm good.

499
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,205
You think there's
even the remotest chance

500
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,208
that the dude who burned down
United Data Group

501
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,376
is the same guy
renting this spot

502
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,460
from your mother?

503
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,257
The beekeeper.

504
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,054
I lost my virginity
in that barn.

505
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,774
Fucking shit.

506
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,039
The universe is going
to have to wait.

507
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,416
I gotta take this.

508
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,629
Yo, what's up, playa?

509
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,755
This is the part
where you tell me

510
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,048
what a good job you did,

511
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,968
and I put you on a G6
to Hawaii to chill for a week.

512
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,678
I'm so sorry, Mr. Danforth.

513
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,055
Did you fuck this up?

514
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,724
Are you fucking crying
right now?

515
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:28,186
I'm not crying.
I'm bleeding.

516
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,104
Bleeding?
Why are you bleeding?

517
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,439
What do you mean, bleeding?

518
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,193
My fingers on my right hand.

519
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,861
He cut them off.

520
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,906
Okay. Fuck off. Go. Go.

521
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:45,203
He? Who the fuck is he?
Tell me who he is right now.

522
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:49,457
I don't know.
A fucking beekeeper.

523
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,418
Makes honey and
fucks with beehives.

524
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,171
He fucks with beehives?
What's he saying about bees?

525
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,173
I don't know.
He said he was, like,

526
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,258
protecting the hive
or something.

527
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,177
Oh, fuck, man. What the...

528
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,637
Oh, Jesus Christ!

529
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,472
No, no, no! Bro, bro, bro!

530
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,973
What do you want from me?

531
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,059
You want money?
You want crypto? NFTs?

532
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,685
I got fucking NFTs.

533
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,312
What are you fucking... What?

534
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,731
No! Dude,
what the fuck is this, man?

535
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,069
Don't move.

536
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,280
I fucking can't move!

537
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,492
You're fucking crazy, man.

538
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,868
What the fuck, bro?

539
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,261
What the fuck!
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

540
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,639
Fucking stop the fucking car!
No! No!

541
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,241
Who do I have the pleasure
of speaking with?

542
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,912
Fuck you. That's who.

543
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,539
You burned down
my million-dollar

544
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,623
fucking call center.

545
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,251
Now I'm going
to burn you down.

546
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,087
You haven't told me your name.

547
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,588
I told you my name.

548
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,798
It's fuck you. Mr. Fuck You.

549
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,216
You better fucking
remember it.

550
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,634
Because you don't
burn me down.

551
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,386
I burn you down.
You understand me?

552
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,763
You are fucking with forces
that you cannot comprehend.

553
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,432
You sound young.

554
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,268
I bet you don't
have estate planning.

555
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,438
I'm fucking 28 years old.
Why would I need that?

556
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,732
I'm about to show you.

557
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,585
Breaking news in Springfield,

558
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,211
where three bodies
have been discovered

559
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,589
following an arson fire
at a small farm.

560
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,424
There was an office building
explosion...

561
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,635
-And you say one guy did this?
-Yup.

562
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,140
Killed seven armed men
without firing a shot.

563
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,435
Yup. And he said
he was going to kill me.

564
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,604
And this is your

565
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,525
data mining consumer service
business, right?

566
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,986
Yes, something like that.

567
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,322
Pulling in 9 million a month
in one office.

568
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,615
I've got, like, 20.

569
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,117
Yeah.

570
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,246
And the only thing
you know about him

571
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,624
is he says he's a beekeeper.

572
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,710
Yeah, it's like
his whole brand or whatever.

573
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,091
Jesus.

574
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,634
What?

575
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:55,351
For someone who has elevated
fucking up into an art form,

576
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,188
this might well
be your Mona Lisa.

577
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,857
How did I fuck up?

578
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,403
I don't know.
You've done something.

579
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,197
You've disturbed a Beekeeper.

580
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,865
Oh.

581
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,991
Oh, okay.

582
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,284
So fucking what?

583
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,619
Why'd I care if the guy
keeps bees?

584
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,746
If a Beekeeper
says you're gonna die,

585
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,872
you're gonna die.

586
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,584
There's nothing I can do
or anybody else to stop it.

587
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:25,506
So, like, what do you
even do here, then?

588
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,258
What good are you?

589
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,135
Yeah.

590
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:35,641
I did 35 years of loyal
government service,

591
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:39,186
culminating as director
of the world's

592
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,063
premier intelligence agency.

593
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,648
I could have done anything,

594
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,151
but I chose this job
as a favor to your mother.

595
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,280
I keep
Danforth Enterprises safe.

596
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:53,993
Keep her reputation safe,
her name safe.

597
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,162
It's my fucking name too,
all right?

598
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,955
Oh, sit down.

599
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,540
I put up with you.

600
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,333
I've put up
with your tantrums,

601
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,503
kept you out of the tabloids,
kept you out of jail.

602
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,966
The endless stream
of sex workers.

603
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,013
You're a drowning man.
Do you know that?

604
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,432
Mm.

605
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,558
You're scared.

606
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,018
Dead right I'm scared.

607
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,646
Terrified. So should you be.

608
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,984
Wallace, just tell me
what the fuck this guy is.

609
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,283
He's probably
the last pair of eyes

610
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,784
that you're going to sneer at.

611
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,334
Okay, listen.

612
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,835
Remember our favorite
burning building?

613
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,170
United Data Group.

614
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,922
The guys who work there
are hackers,

615
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:50,257
con men, fraudsters,
et cetera, et cetera.

616
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,343
Guy who ran it. Garnett.

617
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,095
He's in the book.
He's a known mob associate.

618
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,681
He's missing, but I've got
PD chasing him down.

619
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:00,142
Okay, so I had some analysts
run some shit,

620
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,311
and I think I'm starting to
get the shape of the animal.

621
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,147
Dude, I think
United Data Group

622
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,774
is one of several
call centers.

623
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,651
So there's got to be
like a central office

624
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,902
that's controlling
all of them,

625
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,278
and that's what
we got to find.

626
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,072
Wiley, this could be like

627
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,241
a billion-dollar-a-year
operation.

628
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,201
-Hello?
-Hey!

629
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,494
Did you hear a single word
I just said?

630
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,246
Yeah.

631
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,791
And?

632
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,376
I was just thinking
you come in here,

633
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,710
hungover on your day off,

634
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,212
and gain more yardage
on this thing

635
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,964
than the whole squad has
in two years.

636
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,759
Yeah, well,
they fucked with my family.

637
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,720
What'd you get on Clay?

638
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,347
-Your beekeeper?
-Yeah.

639
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,431
He's a ghost.

640
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,725
What?

641
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,477
Yeah, all I have
is a birth certificate

642
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,520
and a social.

643
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,647
The guy's never even

644
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,690
had a bank account,

645
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,025
credit card, flown on a plane.

646
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,236
I ran his prints through
every database

647
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,904
I can think of, no hits.

648
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,365
That's bullshit.

649
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,950
This dude is former military
all day.

650
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,202
No hits. I'm telling you.

651
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,287
Either he's never
been printed,

652
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,872
or Adam Clay doesn't exist.

653
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,750
Which is terrifying to me

654
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,919
because he's probably
in a classified program.

655
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,715
Special Agent Wiley.

656
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,843
Okay.

657
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,428
-Let's go.
-What?

658
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,680
-They found the guy, Garnett.
-What?

659
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,849
-They found him. Let's go.
-Oh, shit.

660
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,103
Jessica.

661
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,730
I think you know
why I'm calling.

662
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,899
You know,
I'd do anything for you.

663
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,612
Anything for you.

664
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,739
Derek's scared shitless.

665
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,574
I've never seen him
this scared.

666
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,076
Well, he's made his bed.

667
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,079
I'll give you a board seat
on the holding company.

668
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,456
That's another million a year.

669
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,250
Plus you promised
you'd take care of him.

670
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,671
Look, I don't need that.
I have enough.

671
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,256
So you got this?

672
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,844
Yeah. You have my word.

673
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,846
Wallace...

674
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,266
I still think of you...

675
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,686
sometimes.

676
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:08,812
Sometimes.

677
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,705
Why are you calling me

678
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:27,748
on the "never call this line"
line?

679
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,708
This is priority one, Janet.

680
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,669
Well, if it was priority one,
I would know about it.

681
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,337
Look, I'm heading downtown
to a POTUS brief.

682
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,755
Just hear me out.

683
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,340
Now, you know who I work for,
don't you?

684
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,384
Oh, yeah.
God help you, Wallace.

685
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,385
Exactly.

686
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,637
Well, Director Harward,

687
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,305
my young friend,
seems to have caught

688
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,474
the unwanted attentions of...

689
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,060
I don't know
how else to say this.

690
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,520
Of a Beekeeper.

691
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,982
Wait, a Beekeeper Beekeeper?

692
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,150
As in.

693
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,237
-Well, that's not good.
-No, it's not.

694
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:01,031
-What's the body count?
-Seven today.

695
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,827
You busy making
funeral arrangements?

696
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,079
I need help, Janet. Not jokes.

697
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,504
Is that Garnett?

698
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,715
He was strapped
to an old pickup.

699
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:19,800
Check this out.

700
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,486
Does this mean you've
taken pity on an old man?

701
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:44,116
So your problem?
He's retired from the program.

702
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,993
No longer active.

703
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,330
Well, that changes everything.

704
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,375
The current active Beekeeper
is aware of the issue

705
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,043
and is going
to be taking things from here.

706
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,754
You can rest easy, old friend.

707
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,046
Oh, no. Janet.

708
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,049
The current active Beekeeper
is a fucking lunatic

709
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,135
who should have been removed
months ago.

710
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,511
God help us now.

711
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,136
Get out of here!

712
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,059
Shit!

713
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,146
-Excuse me.
-You're cool.

714
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,502
You've been a busy bee.

715
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,420
You're supposed to be retired.

716
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,381
I'm assuming
you're my replacement.

717
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,373
Fuck you!

718
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,303
I need your keys.

719
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,487
There's an issue.

720
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,906
The problem
has not been solved.

721
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,408
Well...

722
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,954
That is a surprise.

723
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,623
The Beekeepers
have studied the situation

724
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,875
and have decided
to remain neutral.

725
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,086
How can they do that?

726
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,129
He was their man,
for fuck's sake!

727
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,756
I'm sorry, Wallace.

728
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,425
You're on your own.

729
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,972
I thought you could
fucking handle this.

730
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,556
I can handle this!

731
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,446
Thank you.

732
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,032
What you got for us,
Detective?

733
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,034
That's her vehicle,

734
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,370
registered
to a Anisette Landress.

735
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,665
The ATF are en route inbound
to take care of it.

736
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,375
We're way cooler than ATF.

737
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,627
I'll show you
why I called them.

738
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,844
That's a Minigun.

739
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,512
They use those
on military vehicles.

740
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,640
Did you know that puppy shoots
6,000 rounds a minute?

741
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,517
I know.

742
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,269
Did you know
that's 100 rounds a second?

743
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,021
Yep, I know.

744
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,898
Did you know
that you know a lot?

745
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,400
Yes, I do.

746
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,568
It's because
I minored in math.

747
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,111
I'm a pretty smart guy
actually.

748
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,238
Okay, then, do you know
who Anisette Landress is?

749
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,198
-Yes, I do.
-Go ahead and tell me.

750
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,034
Someone who doesn't exist

751
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,327
in any commercial
or government database.

752
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,579
Someone who's a ghost.

753
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,081
Like our good friend
Adam Clay.

754
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,544
"Beekeeping for Beekeepers."

755
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,338
Here's another reason

756
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,590
that Anisette Landress

757
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,216
is like our good friend
Adam Clay.

758
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,054
Do you know what's that way?

759
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,599
Springfield...

760
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,559
...where the call center
was torched.

761
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,645
And that way
where Adam Clay's headed?

762
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:08,774
Boston.

763
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,817
Let's go.

764
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:13,862
Thank you.

765
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,420
How are you, my friend?

766
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,797
-Good to see you, sir.
-Good to see you.

767
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:34,508
Yeah, come on,

768
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:35,926
leave them alone.
Leave them alone.

769
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,719
Don't play with those things.
They go off.

770
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,429
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

771
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,810
When I was sworn in
as director,

772
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:49,314
I was read into programs
I never imagined existed.

773
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,734
Well...

774
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:58,949
there are programs
even I wasn't privy to.

775
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,119
Like the Beekeepers.

776
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,998
The honeybee has always

777
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,084
had a special relationship
with humanity.

778
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,752
A sacred relationship.

779
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,256
Why? No bees, no agriculture.

780
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,466
No agriculture,
no civilization.

781
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:20,762
Our nation is not
unlike a beehive,

782
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,932
with its complex systems
of workers,

783
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,892
caretakers, even royalty.

784
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:30,105
If any of the beehive's
complex mechanisms

785
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,356
are compromised,

786
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,317
the hive collapses.

787
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,195
Someone
a long time ago decided

788
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,489
that a mechanism was needed

789
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:40,949
to keep our nation safe.

790
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,577
A mechanism
outside the chain of command,

791
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:46,163
outside the system.

792
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:51,918
Its one mission,
to keep the system safe.

793
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,714
Beekeepers are given
all resources,

794
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:59,968
empowered to act
on their own judgment.

795
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,470
For decades,
they have quietly worked

796
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,806
to keep the hive safe.

797
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:08,185
That is, until now.

798
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,439
It appears
that a retired Beekeeper

799
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,857
has gone off program

800
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,651
and is acting
in what he mistakenly believes

801
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,695
is the hive's best interest.

802
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,573
Can't somebody just
pick up the phone

803
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,700
and tell this yahoo
to stand-the-fuck down?

804
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,952
That's the one thing
Beekeepers don't do.

805
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,370
Stand down.

806
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,915
Not unlike bees themselves,

807
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:33,460
Beekeepers keep working
until they die.

808
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,295
So he's basically one of us.

809
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:38,423
No. He's not like you.

810
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,217
You're tier one operators,

811
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,345
former SEAL Team Six,
Delta Group.

812
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,974
You are, in other words,
pussies.

813
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,602
If you were in the same room,

814
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:51,770
he would kill you.

815
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:56,775
With enough of you,
then maybe you just might

816
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,236
in fact be able to kill him

817
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,321
before he accomplishes
his goal.

818
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,781
What would that be?

819
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:07,410
To kill his way
to the top of the hive.

820
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,916
Mr. Pettis, you should
get your people moving.

821
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,635
Dude, bees are interesting
little shits.

822
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:24,970
Did you know that?

823
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,055
I know they pollinate
a bunch of shit

824
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,473
and we'd be fucked
without them.

825
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,557
Listen.

826
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,643
"Some bees are queen slayers,

827
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,228
"which will rise up
and kill their queen

828
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,521
"if she fails to produce

829
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,481
"the right kind
of male offspring."

830
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,858
Fascinating.

831
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,070
-No.
-Hm. Nope.

832
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,405
-No.
-No!

833
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,823
-It's your turn. You can't...
-No!

834
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,164
Special Agent Parker.

835
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,167
Yeah.

836
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,169
Okay.

837
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,296
Thank you.

838
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,009
What?

839
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,929
The deputy director is flying
up from DC to see us.

840
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,019
Oh, fuck. This is your fault.

841
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,113
Here's another
interesting factoid.

842
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,447
Thank fuck.

843
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,491
You know,
I was getting sick of enjoying

844
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:52,742
my peaceful thoughts.

845
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,330
Sir.

846
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,998
Sir,
this is Special Agent Parker,

847
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,208
Special Agent Wiley.

848
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,709
They'll be briefing you.

849
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,128
This is Deputy Director Prigg

850
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,505
and Amanda Munoz,
special counsel.

851
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,132
Mr. Deputy Director,

852
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,134
my colleague and I believe

853
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,177
that three major crime scenes
in our area

854
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,138
are connected
to a single subject.

855
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,180
Adam Clay.

856
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,640
He killed six people today.

857
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,351
Based on the extensive
use of tradecraft

858
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,061
and the nature of his alias,

859
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,021
we believe
that Mr. Clay is connected

860
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:24,357
to a classified program
named Beekeeper.

861
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,193
A program that none
of our partner agencies

862
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,486
seem willing to acknowledge.

863
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,655
Let's stick to what we know,
Special Agent Parker.

864
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,158
Yes, sir.

865
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:36,035
In any event, this individual
is highly capable

866
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,370
and extremely motivated,

867
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,706
and we believe that he's
on his way to Boston,

868
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,166
if not already here.

869
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:44,210
And we believe
that this is his next target,

870
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,587
Nine Star United,

871
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,464
which appears to be the entity

872
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,965
operating the regional
call centers,

873
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,884
like the one
that Mr. Clay burned down.

874
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,803
Why is Adam Clay
on this rampage?

875
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:59,184
He's, um,
protecting the hive, sir.

876
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,019
It's what Beekeepers do.

877
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,062
I have enough
to brief the director.

878
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,815
-What's your ask?
-My ask?

879
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:09,110
Uh, well, a SWAT team,
for starters.

880
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,197
Surveillance support,
additional agents, analysts.

881
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,407
That shouldn't be a problem.

882
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:15,909
Thank you.

883
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,793
-Did that just happen?
-Yeah.

884
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:33,927
All right.
Everybody, listen up.

885
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,345
It's roll call time.

886
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,388
I'm getting ready
for my dick to get hard

887
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,183
with some wonderful,
beautiful numbers.

888
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,101
Let's start with Phoenix.
Where we at?

889
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:44,145
Phoenix is up 201K.

890
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,523
200K, I'm gonna
suck your dick. I love you.

891
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:48,483
New Orleans, show me,

892
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,943
tell me. Where we at?

893
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,486
It's down 93K, boss.

894
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,404
Down? You're a fucking loser.

895
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:55,114
You give me
a fucking headache.

896
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,324
You give me fucking cancer.

897
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,284
New York, make me happy.
I beg you.

898
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:01,579
New York City's up 64 ASCOT.

899
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:04,249
Yeah! I love you, New York!

900
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,966
Gather around!

901
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:14,884
I want all weapons
front on entry.

902
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,553
-Everybody give me an oos!
-Oos!

903
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:17,637
Let's go!

904
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,603
Power down, my federal friend.
Power down.

905
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,897
Private security here
on the orders of the Governor.

906
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,983
State Department certified
to carry weapons

907
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,067
in all 50 states.

908
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,195
Feel free to call
the highlighted numbers

909
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,280
to verify.

910
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,199
You're not welcome here.
Get the fuck out.

911
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,785
All right, boys, let's go!

912
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,164
Set up a perimeter outside.

913
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,126
Your goals, they mean bonuses.

914
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,545
Money, money, money,
we fucking love it.

915
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,881
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the fuck?

916
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,050
Who the fuck are you?
You can't be in here.

917
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,927
We're the guys
keeping you alive.

918
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,345
Shut it down now.

919
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:00,847
Everybody, listen up.

920
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,432
Anyone who's
not carrying a weapon,

921
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:03,975
get the fuck out!

922
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,393
Shouldn't you be killing
bin Laden or something?

923
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:09,105
Listen to me, my friend.
This place prints money.

924
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:10,815
No one's shutting down.

925
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:14,485
Anybody so much as puts
a phone down, they're fired!

926
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,654
I'm sorry to break it to you,

927
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,114
but bin Laden's been dead
for a while.

928
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:20,533
So I'm going to say this
one last time.

929
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:21,868
Shut it down.

930
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,037
The fuck I am.

931
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,539
Call your fucking boss.

932
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,041
You want me to call my boss?

933
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:29,917
I'll do that.

934
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:35,089
And you'll be so fucked,
it's gonna be beautiful.

935
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,343
Don't be shy. Come on.

936
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:41,262
What about the parking garage?

937
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,181
Closed and locked. Steel gate.

938
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,807
I want a body on comms
watching it.

939
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,310
-Delivery dock?
-Same deal.

940
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,228
-Station an agent there too.
-Yes, sir.

941
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,314
Sure there's no back entrances
into this place?

942
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,857
Hey,
there're no other entrances.

943
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,151
Federal law enforcement
operation in progress.

944
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,444
Move along
at a minimum retreat

945
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,862
to a safe distance.
Thank you.

946
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,238
Someone scout
the service tunnel.

947
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,283
The other option,
instead of going in

948
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,534
is to smoke them out.

949
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:04,869
Excuse me?

950
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,871
I figured I'd give
the firefighters a break.

951
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,791
I've put them through
enough already.

952
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,209
What'd you say your name was?

953
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,919
Currently I go by Adam Clay.

954
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,588
Trust me,
if there was a back entrance,

955
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,756
I would've used it.

956
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:18,299
I don't want to injure anyone

957
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,425
who's innocent
and non-involved.

958
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:21,969
But it is what it is.

959
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,097
Somebody detain this guy!

960
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,958
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

961
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:04,303
Oh, wow,
if it isn't the fucking

962
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:05,555
golden goose himself.

963
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:07,348
Sir, I got
Captain Caveman here

964
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,016
telling me
to send everyone home.

965
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,435
If we do that,

966
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:11,894
we're walking away
from a lot of money.

967
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:13,855
Mm. Put him on.

968
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,232
It's for you.

969
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:19,694
Why are you fucking
with my business?

970
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,446
Because Mr. Westwyld hired me

971
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:23,489
to kick some
fucking Beekeeper's ass.

972
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:26,409
Mr. Westwyld works for me,

973
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,661
which means
that you work for me.

974
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,538
Now, listen, that place

975
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,498
is the crown jewel
of my kingdom.

976
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:34,709
I'm not gonna
let some crash test dummy

977
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,752
with a fucking gun fuck it up.

978
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,628
Is that clear, Mr. Pettis?

979
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,921
Didn't this character
already burn

980
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:39,881
one of your centers
to the ground?

981
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,300
Well, you know,
they didn't have you,

982
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:43,593
and that's why.

983
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:45,762
So maybe you just
do your fucking job

984
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,764
and don't tell me
how to do mine, please.

985
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:49,807
-We got it?
-Copy that.

986
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:54,479
Fall out.
Set up a perimeter outside.

987
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,938
Let's go. Move!

988
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,523
Round of applause.

989
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,609
Let's say goodbye
to our good friends.

990
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,987
Bye-bye, Admiral.
Go join fucking Space Force.

991
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:06,407
You are beautiful.
Now get the fuck out!

992
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:07,909
Keep walking.

993
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,577
Bye-bye, dickhead.

994
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,997
What a bunch of jackoffs.

995
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,957
Yeah, we love you!

996
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,220
One time amnesty.

997
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:28,763
Whoever doesn't want to die
this evening,

998
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:32,308
can in an orderly fashion
leave now.

999
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,936
Uh, uh, uh. No fucking way.
It's not happening.

1000
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,729
Anybody moves, you're fired.

1001
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,773
-No bonus, vesting, two weeks.
-Come on, boys! Move, move!

1002
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,107
Nada. Zero!

1003
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,610
Are you fucking nuts?

1004
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,237
Each one of these
pricks is worth

1005
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:46,280
30 to 40 million a year
in profit.

1006
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,783
So no one is shooting no guns.

1007
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,202
Not a good day to drag
innocent people into this.

1008
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,162
These assholes?
They're not innocent.

1009
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,414
For either one of us
to close that distance,

1010
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:57,083
some of them will get hurt.

1011
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:59,168
Let's start with this prick
right here.

1012
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:15,268
On me!

1013
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:25,528
Take right!

1014
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,211
Pettis, we got a man down.

1015
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:05,776
Fire. Fire.

1016
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,447
Fire. Fire.

1017
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,955
You know
who you're working for?

1018
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:20,041
None of my fucking business.

1019
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,168
I'm just the guy they call
when there's a problem.

1020
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,757
And you are our problem.

1021
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,468
Goddamn right, I'm a problem.

1022
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,326
Fire. Fire.

1023
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,372
Fire. Fire.

1024
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,800
Dan, what the hell happened?

1025
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:12,718
Any dead?

1026
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,595
Not dead,
but we got our asses kicked.

1027
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,223
-Our guy. What do we know?
-He's in the building.

1028
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:18,641
I'm waiting more men
to roll in.

1029
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:20,434
I don't know what this guy is,

1030
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:21,978
but nobody can do
what he's done.

1031
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,854
He's just a Beekeeper.

1032
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,357
Bad idea.

1033
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,068
I'm not waiting.

1034
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,403
-V, wait!
-Move!

1035
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:31,612
Come on, Wiley, keep up.

1036
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,280
Fuck.

1037
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:47,920
We got him!

1038
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,933
-You done?
-Reload.

1039
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,357
Everybody out!

1040
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,287
You're done.

1041
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:39,555
We should take the stairs.

1042
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,015
Smart.

1043
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,934
Subject is in the hallway.

1044
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:47,730
Command, report back.
Anybody on comm?

1045
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,785
Please, please don't kill me.

1046
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:04,246
I'm just a middle manager.
I never hurt nobody.

1047
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,457
I'd respect you more
if you look people

1048
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:08,250
in their eyes
when you steal from them.

1049
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:22,181
Now, you're making
a lot of money here.

1050
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,017
Tell me where it's all going.

1051
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:26,477
I don't know, man.

1052
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:32,358
I know you're the middle man.

1053
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:36,028
-Who's above you?
-No. They'll kill me.

1054
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,951
I'll torture you,
then kill you.

1055
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:48,958
Come on, guys. You got it.

1056
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:51,293
Wiley,
get your ass up here!

1057
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:54,130
Yeah, well,
I'm not an Olympian.

1058
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:56,090
Make it stop.

1059
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,508
You can make it stop.

1060
01:08:58,425 --> 01:09:00,594
You've stolen
hundreds of millions

1061
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:01,929
from people
who've done nothing

1062
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,389
but work hard all their lives.

1063
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:10,646
She was an educator, a mom.

1064
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,940
Dedicated her whole life
to helping people.

1065
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:16,861
Yesterday, she shot herself

1066
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,573
because you took two million
from a charity she ran.

1067
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,372
She was the only person
who ever took care of me.

1068
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,628
Who and where, Mr. Anzalone?

1069
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:37,423
-Tell me who and where.
-I can't.

1070
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:38,632
Look, these people,

1071
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:40,176
they're untouchable.
I can't...

1072
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:42,803
No, please! Please!
Stop! I will! I will!

1073
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:45,222
Let me show you.
Let me show you.

1074
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,367
I told you
they were untouchable.

1075
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,746
Nobody's untouchable.

1076
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:15,002
Sometimes when the hive's
out of balance...

1077
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:18,797
you have to replace the queen.

1078
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:25,512
Clay!

1079
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:30,684
That man is directly
responsible

1080
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:31,936
for your mother's death.

1081
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:36,607
I believe you.

1082
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,610
But we have laws
for these things.

1083
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:45,074
You have laws for these things
until they fail.

1084
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:48,244
Then you have me.

1085
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:59,338
Arrest him!

1086
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,341
On your feet before I blow
your fucking head off.

1087
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:04,510
I just been thrown through
a plate glass window.

1088
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:05,594
Shut your fucking mouth!

1089
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:20,943
Whoa. I have four kids.

1090
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:25,281
I know. Three boys and a girl.

1091
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:40,045
Wiley? You okay?

1092
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:41,839
-Yeah. He went that way.
-You okay?

1093
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,257
-Have you been hit?
-My wife thinks

1094
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,633
I'm doing computer nerd shit.

1095
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:46,010
Well, I won't tell her
if you don't.

1096
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:47,344
-Have you been hit?
-No, I'm good, Mom.

1097
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:48,721
Did you get him?

1098
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:50,514
-Did you?
-No, he's tricky.

1099
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,266
-Get up. You okay?
-Almost, but...

1100
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,726
I guess that's just evidence.

1101
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:55,811
-Can I borrow your gun?
-Yeah. Let's go.

1102
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:58,105
-On me. On me. On me. On me.
-Clear!

1103
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,489
I want interviews
with all of them.

1104
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:15,039
We're going to talk.

1105
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,041
Get him out of here.

1106
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:35,768
Wiley.

1107
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,485
Holy shit.

1108
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:56,997
Do you mind
if I ask you

1109
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,290
a really boring question?

1110
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:01,293
Do you actually prefer
the money or the power?

1111
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:03,087
Mm.

1112
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:04,380
That's deep.

1113
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:06,423
Oh, I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

1114
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,803
Oh, God. Uh...

1115
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:12,930
Would you excuse me
for a moment? Come upstairs.

1116
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:19,520
You said these guys
were the fucking best. Uh...

1117
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:20,729
Why are they all dead?

1118
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:23,232
You kicked the beehive

1119
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:25,484
and now we have
to reap the whirlwind.

1120
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:29,738
-Unless...
-Unless.

1121
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,657
Unless, unless,
unless fucking what?

1122
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:34,993
Maybe now is the time
to call your mother.

1123
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:39,415
I'm paying you
so much fucking money

1124
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:40,916
and your advice
is to call my mother?

1125
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:44,711
He can't make his move on us

1126
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:47,297
if we're in her proximity,
can he?

1127
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:48,882
Her people.

1128
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,224
You're a fuck.

1129
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:59,726
-You're scared...
-I certainly am scared.

1130
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:00,853
...and you want
to use my mother

1131
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:02,271
as a human shield.

1132
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:04,231
Just call her.
Just call her. Come on.

1133
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:06,692
It's not a game now.

1134
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:07,901
Oh, it's all a game.

1135
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,611
Come on.

1136
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,114
Yes, Derek. What do you want?

1137
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:14,158
Hey, Mom. No, nothing.

1138
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:15,951
I was just, you know,
thinking about you.

1139
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:18,662
I miss you. I was hoping
to maybe see you this weekend.

1140
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:20,622
I'm at the beach house.

1141
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:21,915
You're welcome to join
if you behave.

1142
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,668
I would love to. And, hey,
I actually was going to,

1143
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,170
you know,
get together with some of my

1144
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:27,296
tech homies and stuff,
if that's, uh,

1145
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:28,964
if that's cool with you.

1146
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:30,507
Fine. No drugs.

1147
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:32,593
Give Kelly the details.
Love you. Have to go.

1148
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,220
Derek's joining me
this weekend.

1149
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:36,430
Help me keep him sober.

1150
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,890
Yes, ma'am.
I love babysitting.

1151
01:14:38,515 --> 01:14:40,267
Madame President, Funmi Lawal.

1152
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,060
Hello. Good to meet you.

1153
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:43,353
Sola Oyemade.

1154
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:44,897
Sola, thank you so much
for coming.

1155
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:46,190
Susan Aneno.

1156
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:47,941
Thank you so much
for coming all this way.

1157
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:49,109
Oli Ray-Imanuel.

1158
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:50,777
-Oli, how good to meet you.
-Great to meet you, ma'am.

1159
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:00,287
You don't have to do this,
you know?

1160
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,540
Why not let Clay do his thing?

1161
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,920
Your mom is dead
because of these people.

1162
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:17,679
Wherever it's headed...

1163
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:20,432
I swore an oath.

1164
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,894
I can't stand by
and watch it happen.

1165
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,444
Even if he's right?

1166
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:39,826
Even if he's right.

1167
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:45,123
Apologies.
Damn plane was delayed.

1168
01:15:45,165 --> 01:15:46,208
What have you got?

1169
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:49,836
We think we have a sense
of Mr. Clay's true intentions.

1170
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:52,464
He seems to be
following the money.

1171
01:15:53,423 --> 01:15:54,591
What money is that?

1172
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:58,262
Usually it's from people
with no heirs, no family.

1173
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:01,056
Nine Star United uses
data mining software

1174
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:04,142
to identify these people
and then target their assets.

1175
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:07,938
There's another
company involved, sir,

1176
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,524
a company who is a vendor
to the intelligence community

1177
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:11,817
and to the Justice Department.

1178
01:16:11,858 --> 01:16:13,986
In fact,
we use this company's software

1179
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:15,487
in this very office

1180
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:18,156
to identify financial fraud.

1181
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,952
Are you going to tell me
the name of this company?

1182
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,751
Danforth Enterprises.

1183
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:33,171
With an annual revenue
of $10 billion,

1184
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:37,301
founded and operated
by Jessica Danforth,

1185
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:39,678
who recently stepped down
because she was sworn in

1186
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,264
as President
of the United States.

1187
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:44,516
She self-financed
her campaign.

1188
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:47,269
Yeah.
None of that money was clean.

1189
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:48,937
Who else knows this?

1190
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:51,732
Us three.

1191
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:54,276
I have a really bad memory,
sir.

1192
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:57,237
Let's, uh,
keep the circle small,

1193
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,489
until I can brief the director
and the attorney general.

1194
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:01,617
Not a word of this to anyone.
Understood?

1195
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:02,993
Yes, sir.

1196
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:04,578
And, Mr. Clay,
I see his kill count

1197
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,996
is steadily rising.

1198
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,414
In a beehive,
there is something

1199
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:08,832
called a "queen slayer."

1200
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:12,377
It's a bee that will rise up
and kill the queen

1201
01:17:13,086 --> 01:17:15,589
if she produces
defective offspring.

1202
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:18,008
I thought we were sticking
to the known knowns.

1203
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:21,053
Right. Yes.
Not that Beekeepers exist.

1204
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:24,056
But Mr. Clay
does keep honey bees.

1205
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,183
He admires their willingness

1206
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:28,935
to sacrifice themselves
for the greater good.

1207
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:34,441
Our concern is that Clay
believes that Derek Danforth

1208
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,110
is the defective offspring
of a queen,

1209
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:40,739
thereby Clay will strike
at the heart of the problem

1210
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:42,991
and become a queen slayer.

1211
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:48,288
Adam Clay's next victim
is Derek Danforth's mother?

1212
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,208
President Danforth, sir.

1213
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:54,461
You have a blank check.
Good luck.

1214
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:57,422
Thank you.

1215
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:15,357
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa. This is a private event.

1216
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:17,526
I'm gonna need you
to turn around, go away.

1217
01:18:17,567 --> 01:18:19,528
Federal Bureau of something
or another.

1218
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:21,113
We're good.
We have invites right here.

1219
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:22,823
All right. You'll need
to excuse my partner.

1220
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:24,533
He's recently concussed
and hasn't slept in two days.

1221
01:18:24,574 --> 01:18:25,701
We're on the access list.

1222
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:28,203
We're good, boss.

1223
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:58,358
Get the Secret Service
out of the house.

1224
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,568
I don't want them here.

1225
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:01,528
They're C team.
B team at best.

1226
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:04,614
Uh, Mom's detail is not going
to like that.

1227
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:07,534
Well, if Mom's detail
gets in the way

1228
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,618
of what's coming for us,

1229
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:10,287
they're dead men
and so are we.

1230
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:13,540
Tell them they can
stay in the kitchen.

1231
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:14,624
Yes, sir.

1232
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:21,256
He has a little talent,
doesn't he?

1233
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:22,924
He's absolutely
fucking terrifying.

1234
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:24,342
Yeah.

1235
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:26,052
Good men,
but clearly not good enough.

1236
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:28,388
-Hm.
-Fuck, bruh!

1237
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,474
How'd you piss this oak off,
huh?

1238
01:19:30,515 --> 01:19:31,808
I...

1239
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,560
-You're looking at me?
-Mm-hmm.

1240
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,312
How is any of this my fault?

1241
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:37,814
Wasn't your supersecret CIA

1242
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,399
data mining software
supposed to,

1243
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:40,692
I don't know, maybe filter out

1244
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:42,277
un-fucking-stoppable
killing machines?

1245
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:43,904
Don't you fuck with me,
young man!

1246
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,572
Any other life,
you'd be in jail.

1247
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,158
Hey, this is the fucking
Beekeeper!

1248
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,705
Yeah, you know
I killed one once.

1249
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:55,081
Oh, you see?

1250
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:57,209
Yeah. Only 'cause I was lucky.

1251
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:00,086
-And un-fucking-lucky.
-Oh, jeez.

1252
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,966
Yeah, don't piss your pants,
bruh.

1253
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:06,384
My team will be out shortly.

1254
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,136
If anyone can knock

1255
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:09,846
this guy's dick in the dirt,
it's them.

1256
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:12,557
Ain't that right, money man?

1257
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:16,144
Yeah.

1258
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:33,453
I'm supposed to be
at a kids' birthday party

1259
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:34,538
with my wife.

1260
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,335
You are at a kids'
birthday party.

1261
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:41,753
And I'm your work wife.

1262
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:59,521
Madam President,
you look spectacular.

1263
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:00,856
When the fuck are you
going to tell me

1264
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:02,524
what's going on, Wallace?

1265
01:21:06,152 --> 01:21:07,654
Good. Go through.

1266
01:21:09,072 --> 01:21:10,615
Tell that guy
to hurry up.

1267
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:13,451
I want every manhole
on this street welded shut.

1268
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:23,587
Six up.

1269
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:25,714
Good to go.

1270
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:28,341
Let's go. Let's go.

1271
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,022
Come on. Move it up.

1272
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:01,041
Put your head
on a swivel, gentlemen.

1273
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:18,433
Go!

1274
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:48,088
We got eyes
on the second floor.

1275
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,722
All right, you're good.
Coming through.

1276
01:23:21,454 --> 01:23:22,872
Oh.

1277
01:23:22,914 --> 01:23:26,334
Hey. When, uh, did you get in?
What a surprise.

1278
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:30,422
You didn't hear
the giant Marine helicopter

1279
01:23:30,463 --> 01:23:31,881
land on the front lawn?

1280
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:34,384
Ah, I guess not. Hm.

1281
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:36,428
Is this, uh, nicotine
or a carnival ride?

1282
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:39,264
Uh, I wouldn't unless
you want to go

1283
01:23:39,305 --> 01:23:40,473
talk with the machine elves.

1284
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:46,896
Hey, you look fucking great,
by the way.

1285
01:23:46,938 --> 01:23:49,774
I mean, power,
it just looks so good on you.

1286
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:52,485
Doing blow
on your father's desk.

1287
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:54,279
God, how I wish
he was still alive

1288
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,197
so I could kill him.

1289
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:00,076
Stop picking your face.

1290
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:05,832
Why does Wallace Westwyld
look nervous as a burning cat?

1291
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,083
What have you done to the man?

1292
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:10,086
Mm, I wouldn't know, Mother.

1293
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:12,380
Well, he's there
to protect you

1294
01:24:12,422 --> 01:24:13,465
if you'll let him.

1295
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:19,679
You're a good looking kid.
You really are. You know that?

1296
01:24:21,347 --> 01:24:22,390
What does that mean?

1297
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:28,188
It means that God doesn't give
with both hands.

1298
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,440
Uh, okay.
I love you too, Mom.

1299
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:31,983
Hm.

1300
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:33,693
Gotta go run the free world.

1301
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:35,612
Don't burn it down.

1302
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:44,037
Fucking fantastic!

1303
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:52,981
Wiley, look.

1304
01:25:54,357 --> 01:25:56,109
Oh, shit.

1305
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,944
Danforth looks like
she wants to throw up.

1306
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:00,822
Look at her body language.
Bad vibes.

1307
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:03,533
She got caught riding dirty.

1308
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:06,202
What have we done?

1309
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,205
Are you, uh, fucking
with crypto at all, right now?

1310
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:10,498
It's gonna pop.

1311
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:13,126
They're minting next week,
so just hit me up on Insta.

1312
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,878
-Okay.
-I'll connect your wallet.

1313
01:26:14,919 --> 01:26:16,671
-May I borrow my son?
-Of course.

1314
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:18,256
Speak to you a moment
in private?

1315
01:26:20,466 --> 01:26:21,467
Sorry.

1316
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:25,972
Uh, who's this?

1317
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,099
Jackson Prigg.
He's number two at the FBI.

1318
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:29,184
Have a seat.

1319
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:31,102
Uh, I'm cool. I'll stand.

1320
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:32,312
What is this, like,
an ambush or something?

1321
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:33,062
This feels weird.
I don't like it.

1322
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:34,063
No, you'll sit.

1323
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:38,735
I'll sit.

1324
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:43,948
Kelly, would you
give us a moment?

1325
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:45,366
It's okay, ma'am.
I can take notes.

1326
01:26:45,408 --> 01:26:46,868
I need you to step outside.

1327
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:58,254
The deputy director
has flagged his, uh, concerns

1328
01:26:58,296 --> 01:26:59,797
about some
uncomfortable things

1329
01:26:59,839 --> 01:27:01,466
happening inside
the family company.

1330
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:03,343
Like what?

1331
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:04,677
Uncomfortable things about

1332
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,471
the source
of my campaign funds.

1333
01:27:07,847 --> 01:27:09,766
Sounds serious. What's up?

1334
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:12,268
Deputy Director.

1335
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:16,689
Mr. Danforth, are you familiar
with, uh, United Data Group?

1336
01:27:17,982 --> 01:27:19,943
United Data Group.

1337
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:23,196
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh...

1338
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,365
I invested in that.

1339
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,242
I invest everywhere.

1340
01:27:27,283 --> 01:27:28,618
I mean, there's...
It's everywhere.

1341
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,453
-It's very diverse.
-Uh-huh.

1342
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:33,414
How about, uh,
Nine Star United?

1343
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:37,961
Yeah, that was, uh...

1344
01:27:38,002 --> 01:27:40,463
that's more of, like,
a consulting type role.

1345
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:42,674
It's block chain issues.
And you probably...

1346
01:27:42,715 --> 01:27:45,134
I don't want to bore you
with all that.

1347
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:49,973
What do you know
about a classified algorithmic

1348
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:51,683
data mining software package

1349
01:27:51,724 --> 01:27:54,227
developed by
the intelligence community?

1350
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,450
He's here.

1351
01:28:10,493 --> 01:28:12,370
All stations, target's
in the building. East wing.

1352
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:13,830
Give me everything you got.

1353
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:14,998
He's in the house!

1354
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:17,458
Assault team, saddle up!

1355
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,043
Let's move, boys!
Get a move on!

1356
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:20,086
Let's move! Come on!

1357
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:22,839
-Go! Come on. Move!
-Go! Go!

1358
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:25,925
Break-break!
Package is in the house!

1359
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:27,719
Level three, side four.

1360
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:30,638
Blue over blue, you see him,
you fucking get him!

1361
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:33,766
Hey!
Put your fucking hands up.

1362
01:28:35,852 --> 01:28:37,478
Now turn the fuck around.

1363
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:43,818
-Fuck.
-Fuck.

1364
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:48,072
He's outside.
Target's outside.

1365
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:49,532
Move! Move!

1366
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,117
Let's get this fucking guy!

1367
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,994
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, killer. You see him?

1368
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:54,996
Negative.

1369
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:56,748
-Clay!
-That's right.

1370
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:01,794
That's right.
Now, on your knees!

1371
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:03,504
On your knees!

1372
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:06,966
Lace your fingers
behind your head.

1373
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:12,597
Down on your knees now!

1374
01:29:12,638 --> 01:29:13,931
Do it now!

1375
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:23,316
Beekeeper, huh?
God's right hand?

1376
01:29:23,816 --> 01:29:24,859
You aren't shit.

1377
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:26,069
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1378
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:27,070
Hey,
take a step back.

1379
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:29,989
I'm putting this asshole's
brains on the lawn.

1380
01:29:30,573 --> 01:29:31,908
What are you doing?
He's not even armed.

1381
01:29:31,949 --> 01:29:33,576
Armed?

1382
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:35,828
As long as this motherfucker's
breathing, he's armed.

1383
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:38,122
You're not fucking
executing him.

1384
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:40,416
Nice crowd
you're rolling with.

1385
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:49,258
Watch me.

1386
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:51,636
V, what the fuck is going on?

1387
01:29:52,136 --> 01:29:54,389
To "bee" or not to "bee"?

1388
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,891
Isn't that
the bloody question?

1389
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:59,102
I think I'll take

1390
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:01,104
to "bee."

1391
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:13,449
-Wiley?
-Yeah, you good?

1392
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:14,617
-Yeah.
-Go.

1393
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:18,955
Get off me!

1394
01:30:20,164 --> 01:30:21,666
He's fucking mine!

1395
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:24,544
Talk to me, people.
I need news.

1396
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:35,054
He's here!

1397
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:36,764
Go! Go! All stations!

1398
01:30:39,725 --> 01:30:41,936
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1399
01:30:46,482 --> 01:30:47,775
Go with the flow.

1400
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:49,193
Not clear.
He's not clear.

1401
01:30:49,235 --> 01:30:50,194
Hang tight.

1402
01:30:50,236 --> 01:30:51,279
On me.

1403
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:13,551
Get on the ground.
Get on the ground.

1404
01:31:16,512 --> 01:31:18,890
You understand you did this,
right?

1405
01:31:18,931 --> 01:31:20,183
You broke the rules.

1406
01:31:20,683 --> 01:31:22,643
You corrupted an imperfect
but functioning system.

1407
01:31:22,685 --> 01:31:24,270
I was just trying
to get you into office, Mom.

1408
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:26,147
How else do you think
you got elected?

1409
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:27,899
I was going to win
with or without your help.

1410
01:31:28,524 --> 01:31:31,736
We were already rich.
Your father built an empire.

1411
01:31:31,777 --> 01:31:33,362
Yeah. And you were going
to fucking

1412
01:31:33,404 --> 01:31:35,239
break it up into pieces
and sell it off.

1413
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:36,699
Well, in the name
of public service

1414
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:39,368
because I care and I want
to leave a better world.

1415
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:40,536
Okay. Right.

1416
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:42,288
Yeah, because
you hate the fact

1417
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,664
that being the president

1418
01:31:43,706 --> 01:31:44,499
is just like
an endless cocktail party.

1419
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:46,542
You realize
that you were behind

1420
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:48,503
in 15 of 20 counties
you needed to win.

1421
01:31:48,544 --> 01:31:49,629
15 of 20 counties!

1422
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:53,090
I taught CIA software
to hunt money

1423
01:31:53,132 --> 01:31:54,383
and not terrorists.

1424
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:57,303
You didn't hear that.

1425
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:12,693
You got elected because of me,
and you know that.

1426
01:32:12,735 --> 01:32:15,154
Yeah, I know it.
Everyone knows it.

1427
01:32:15,738 --> 01:32:16,906
Now I know
where the money came from...

1428
01:32:18,115 --> 01:32:19,408
...and all the people
you hurt.

1429
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:21,452
Okay, whatever.
It's computer data, Mom.

1430
01:32:21,494 --> 01:32:22,703
Somebody in this family
has to have

1431
01:32:22,745 --> 01:32:23,996
their fucking feet
on the ground

1432
01:32:24,413 --> 01:32:25,164
to actually get shit done.
You understand that?

1433
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:45,017
Mom, the wolves are
at the fucking door right now.

1434
01:32:45,601 --> 01:32:47,144
What are you going to do
to fix this?

1435
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:51,983
Tell the truth.

1436
01:32:54,026 --> 01:32:55,278
The fucking...

1437
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:56,904
What does that even mean?

1438
01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:58,948
What does that even mean,
tell the fucking truth?

1439
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:00,449
You have an entire building

1440
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:01,659
full of PR people

1441
01:33:02,076 --> 01:33:03,494
that are going to choose
the right way forward.

1442
01:33:03,536 --> 01:33:05,621
That guy who's coming
to kill us, that Beekeeper,

1443
01:33:05,663 --> 01:33:08,541
I'm telling him the truth
about what you did, Derek.

1444
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,376
Then I'm telling
the entire nation.

1445
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:12,211
And if it costs me everything,

1446
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,046
well, so be it.

1447
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:29,038
You fucking git!

1448
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:36,379
Fuck!

1449
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:42,551
You're just a man.

1450
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:44,387
I know.

1451
01:35:38,190 --> 01:35:40,067
Thank you.

1452
01:36:15,144 --> 01:36:17,605
Jesus. Looks like
a tornado came through here.

1453
01:36:23,569 --> 01:36:25,029
What's your plan here, huh?

1454
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:26,655
You're going to tell this guy
the fucking truth

1455
01:36:26,697 --> 01:36:28,157
and hope that he spares you
and kills me instead?

1456
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:29,283
No, Derek,
I'll tell him the truth

1457
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:30,618
because it's the truth.

1458
01:36:40,586 --> 01:36:42,755
It's gone far enough.
You've proved your point.

1459
01:36:43,839 --> 01:36:46,258
Beekeepers live
for the good of society.

1460
01:36:47,718 --> 01:36:48,886
I'm retired.

1461
01:36:50,137 --> 01:36:51,430
This is personal.

1462
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:54,099
All the more reason to stop.

1463
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:57,895
Go back. Live a quiet life.

1464
01:36:58,521 --> 01:37:00,397
Making honey
for your neighbors.

1465
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:02,066
That's all I wanted.

1466
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:06,237
-My neighbor's dead.
-I know. I'm sorry.

1467
01:37:06,278 --> 01:37:08,572
But do you live
in the real world

1468
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:10,324
or just protect it?

1469
01:37:13,702 --> 01:37:14,912
What does it matter to you

1470
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:17,748
how presidents
come to be elected?

1471
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:20,042
-Hm?
-It doesn't.

1472
01:37:20,459 --> 01:37:22,086
What does matter to you?

1473
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:24,129
Right and wrong.

1474
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:26,382
It's not fashionable.

1475
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:29,260
I believe there's good
in the universe.

1476
01:37:29,301 --> 01:37:33,389
Yeah, well, we agree.
I mean, that's my view.

1477
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:36,600
Until the Danforth family
bought you.

1478
01:37:37,142 --> 01:37:39,144
-Ah.
-You can stop pretending.

1479
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:42,898
We wouldn't need Beekeepers
if it wasn't for men like you.

1480
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:44,859
Don't do that.

1481
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,110
Sir, you might want
to step back.

1482
01:37:46,151 --> 01:37:47,403
No.

1483
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:49,989
-I don't want you to get hurt.
-I'm sorry. I can't do that.

1484
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:52,950
Now, have a seat.

1485
01:37:57,162 --> 01:38:00,457
Nah, fuck the truth, man.
The truth...

1486
01:38:00,499 --> 01:38:01,667
-Wait. You put that down.
-No, Derek.

1487
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:03,252
...comes out
of your fucking...

1488
01:38:04,211 --> 01:38:05,504
Jesus Christ!

1489
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:06,797
That's fucking real
right there.

1490
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:21,604
-Clay, no!
-Drop your weapon. Drop it!

1491
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:40,122
You decide who you work for.

1492
01:38:42,207 --> 01:38:43,542
For the law

1493
01:38:45,294 --> 01:38:46,962
or for justice.

1494
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:51,133
Fuck this.

1495
01:38:51,508 --> 01:38:52,509
Bye, Mom.

1496
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:01,018
-Go! Go!
-Move. Move.

1497
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:02,645
-Move it out. Out of the way.
-You're okay.

1498
01:39:02,686 --> 01:39:05,940
-I got you. I got you.
-No. No. I want my...

1499
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:08,359
Clay!

1500
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:12,905
Come with us right now!

1501
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:16,742
-No! I want my... I want my...
-Back away. Back away.

1502
01:39:17,242 --> 01:39:18,869
No!

1503
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:20,162
You need to come
with me. Come on.

1504
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:22,122
-No!
-Move out. Move out.

1505
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:25,209
-Give me your hand. Come on!
-No!

1506
01:39:38,263 --> 01:39:39,723
Goodbye, Adam Clay.

1507
01:39:40,849 --> 01:39:43,060
Keep eyes on! Let's go!
