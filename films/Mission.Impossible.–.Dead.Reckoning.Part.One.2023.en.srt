1
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:04,899
miraculously.

2
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:08,069
We are navigating under the Arctic ice cap

3
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:10,989
by dead reckoning and five days from home.

4
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:14,200
After 25, 000 nautical miles,

5
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:16,995
the Sevastopol has deliberately approached

6
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:18,997
every navy in the world

7
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,833
and remained completely undetected.

8
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:28,881
The Podkova's stealth capability has exceeded all expectations.

9
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:40,310
We are at this moment the state of the art of war.

10
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:46,733
The most fearsome killing machine

11
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,651
ever devised by man.

12
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:54,282
And we are impossible to find.

13
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:00,747
Captain, we have a submerged contact, designated Semyon-83,

14
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,499
exhibiting tonals of a US Virginia-class submarine.

15
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,293
Bearing 130°, drawing forward.

16
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:09,172
Chief of the Watch, man battle stations silently.

17
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:11,633
- Wait for orders. - Officer of the Deck, ship status?

18
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:14,218
Ship's depth, 50 meters. Bottom, 72 meters.

19
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,471
Clearance to the ice canopy, 21 meters.

20
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,514
- Distance to deep water? - Two kilometers.

21
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:20,391
Aleutian Precipice in six minutes.

22
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:23,394
Ranging maneuver. Helm, left 15 degrees rudder.

23
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:24,604
Steady course 100°.

24
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,272
Come up easy on a standard bell.

25
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:28,066
- Captain has the conn. - Helm, aye!

26
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,567
Coming to course 100°.

27
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:45,875
Steady on course 100°.

28
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,418
Weapons Officer, range?

29
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:51,339
Firing solution is tracking at a distance of 15,000 meters.

30
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:54,467
Sir, that doesn't make sense. Tonals this loud and clear?

31
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,510
He must be closer than that.

32
00:02:57,762 --> 00:03:01,724
Captain, firing solution just did a step change to 10,000 meters.

33
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:03,768
Nothing moves that fast.

34
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,061
All solutions are matching.

35
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,312
The range is true.

36
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:08,523
Helm, right full rudder to course 270°.

37
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,191
Course 270°, aye.

38
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,197
We'll just walk away and head for deep water.

39
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,118
Contact bearing 160°. Bearing rate zero?

40
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:23,204
He's there, turning with us again.

41
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:25,498
He can see us.

42
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,167
Impossible. We're invisible.

43
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:31,129
Weapons, run diagnostics on sonar and fire control.

44
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:32,422
Something isn't right.

45
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,465
Sir, he's flooding his torpedo tubes!

46
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,175
Torpedo room, conn.

47
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,094
- Load all torpedo tubes. - Aye, sir.

48
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,558
- Check clear! - Forward clear!

49
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,144
- Aft clear! Ram torpedo! - Ramming!

50
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:49,439
Torpedo tubes loaded.

51
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:50,982
He's opened outer doors!

52
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,168
Weapons, flood tubes one through four and open outer doors.

53
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,069
Enter firing solution into tube two.

54
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:57,864
Aye, Captain. Making tube two ready in all respects.

55
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,282
Captain, he's provoking us.

56
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,743
He wants an excuse to blow us out of the water.

57
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:05,371
Enemy torpedo in the water, bearing 200°. 1,000 meters and accelerating.

58
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:07,307
Helm, left full rudder, all ahead flank cavitate.

59
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:10,501
My rudder is left full. Answering all ahead flank cavitate.

60
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:12,705
- Launch countermeasures. - Launching countermeasures.

61
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:16,965
Fire tube two.

62
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,176
Firing tube two.

63
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,097
Our torpedo is away. Running hot.

64
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:28,853
Enemy torpedo still homing, range 800 meters.

65
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,330
He's blown through our countermeasures.

66
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,231
- Helm, right full rudder. - Right full.

67
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,649
- Aye, sir! - 600 meters.

68
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,253
Diving Officer, stand by to emergency blow all main ballast tanks.

69
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:37,235
400 meters.

70
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,882
Chief of the Watch, stand by the collision alarm.

71
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:40,573
- 200 meters. - This is the captain.

72
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:43,242
- All hands brace for impact. - Enemy torpedo impact in...

73
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:45,495
five... four...

74
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:48,581
three... two...

75
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:51,667
one. Impact!

76
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,055
What just happened?

77
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,223
It's, it's gone.

78
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,558
- It missed us? - No.

79
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:11,020
It vanished like it was never there.

80
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,564
Sonar, where is the enemy vessel?

81
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:16,359
Bearing 330°, 4,000 meters off our starboard bow.

82
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:18,194
Our torpedo is running true.

83
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,571
Impact with enemy submarine in...

84
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:24,200
three... two... one.

85
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:29,872
Where was the impact?

86
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:32,625
Captain, enemy submarine has vanished.

87
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,168
It's gone, sir.

88
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,087
I don't understand.

89
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:42,677
He was never there.

90
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:47,431
We've been chasing a phantom.

91
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:50,184
It was right there. The instruments don't lie.

92
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:52,520
They lied to us today.

93
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:55,398
- Weapons, shut down our torpedo. - Aye, Captain.

94
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,191
Shutting down torpedo.

95
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:59,235
Secure from battle stations.

96
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,448
This is why we have sea trials.

97
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,034
There's a bug in the system.

98
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,496
A ghost in the machine.

99
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,959
- It's time to go home. - Captain!

100
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,752
Our own torpedo is not responding.

101
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:18,087
It's coming right at us!

102
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,756
Our torpedo's homing, range 400 meters!

103
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,175
- Oh, my God. - Wire command. Shut down our weapon!

104
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,014
Our torpedo's still closing, range 200 meters!

105
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:31,017
Blow all main ballast tanks! Sound the collision alar...

106
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,953
Food delivery.

107
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,130
Hello?

108
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:52,598
Designator.

109
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,183
Easy.

110
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:56,727
Easy.

111
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,314
Designator.

112
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,986
India-Zulu-254.

113
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,905
Bravo-Echo-1 1.

114
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,033
No, not yet.

115
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:13,661
You need to ask me the security question first.

116
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,454
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

117
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:17,415
Uh...

118
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:19,542
what is the oath?

119
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,757
We live and die in the shadows...

120
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,844
for those we hold close...

121
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:33,222
and for those we never meet.

122
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,602
You can put it on the table.

123
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,369
Hey.

124
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,499
Welcome to the IMF.

125
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,211
You made the right choice.

126
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:08,966
Sir.

127
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:16,432
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

128
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,477
It's been a long time.

129
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,938
Our lives are the sum of our choices,

130
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,358
and we cannot escape the past.

131
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,529
Thirty years ago, you were offered the choice.

132
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:34,200
Join the IMF or spend your life in prison.

133
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,703
Because ofyour unique natural talents,

134
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:39,955
your government forgave you.

135
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,374
But we will never forget.

136
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,002
Just as you will never forget the death

137
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:48,089
that broughtyou to us all those years ago.

138
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:04,063
This is to remind you

139
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,732
ofyour oath and allegiance to us.

140
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,402
The stakes of this mission are higher than ever.

141
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:13,781
Your habitual rogue behavior will not be tolerated.

142
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,574
Should you choose to accept,

143
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:18,369
it is imperative thatyou listen.

144
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:22,081
Your government is searching for a key.

145
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:25,376
Its purpose, its vital importance to us

146
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,837
is none ofyour concern.

147
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,672
What should concern you

148
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,842
is the involvement ofyour friend Ilsa Faust.

149
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,887
She killed a courier in Istanbul.

150
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:39,098
And we believe he was carrying one half

151
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,600
of the key we're searching for.

152
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:45,896
Why she has chosen to interfere in this affair is a mystery,

153
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,898
as are her whereabouts.

154
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,401
What is certain

155
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:53,279
is thatyour government has put a price on her head...

156
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,908
and these bounty hunters are out to collect it.

157
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,996
They never bring a fugitive back alive,

158
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,874
and rarely in one piece.

159
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:08,335
We believe they're headed for the Arabian Desert's Empty Quarter

160
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:09,920
in search ofyour friend.

161
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:14,550
Find the bounty hunters, and you may just find her.

162
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,720
Your mission, should you choose to accept it,

163
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:21,182
is to acquire the key and deliver it to us.

164
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:24,560
What happens to Ilsa after that is up to you.

165
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:26,687
As always,

166
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,481
if any members ofyour team are caught or killed,

167
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:32,902
the secretary will disavow any knowledge ofyour actions.

168
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:37,698
This message will self-destruct in five seconds.

169
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,117
Good luck, Ethan.

170
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,110
Come.

171
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,953
Ethan.

172
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,734
Hyah! Hyah!

173
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,571
Ohh!

174
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,200
So what are we dealing with?

175
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:56,373
This "entity" has multiple personalities, at times behaving like a computer virus,

176
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:58,542
then a tapeworm, then a botnet.

177
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,711
Distorting any and all digital information

178
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,296
with which it comes in contact.

179
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,090
Once infected, nothing recorded, stored,

180
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:08,010
or transmitted digitally can be trusted as fact.

181
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:11,722
At the outset, it concentrated primarily on news and social media

182
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:15,017
which was of little concern to us as it often suited our purposes.

183
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,144
Until six months ago, when the entity breached

184
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,438
Saudi Arabia's General Intelligence Directorate.

185
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:22,900
And assimilated their top secret active-learning AI

186
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,235
before vanishing into the cloud.

187
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:28,238
Subsequent attacks increased ten-thousandfold overnight,

188
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,240
spreading exponentially.

189
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,951
Indicating that the Entity has since become

190
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:34,745
sentient.

191
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,915
You're telling me this thing has a mind of its own?

192
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,833
Over the last three weeks alone,

193
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,503
it has accessed our satellite telecommunications,

194
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,755
the Federal Reserve, the stock market,

195
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,256
and the national power grid.

196
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,551
The FAA, NASA and the combined branches of our military.

197
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,053
And we're not alone.

198
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:54,306
It has penetrated the World and European Central Banks.

199
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,684
Gained entry to the major defense, finance and infrastructure systems

200
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:02,272
of Russia, India, Israel, Australasia, all ofEurope.

201
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:05,025
And what did it do to all these systems exactly?

202
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,151
Nothing.

203
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,530
- Nothing? - It came and it went,

204
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,741
leaving fingerprints where they could easily be found

205
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,494
and sending a very clear message.

206
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,830
"I shall return."

207
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:22,668
Whatever its ultimate goal is, we're powerless to stop it.

208
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,170
The full force of its energy is now directed

209
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:26,588
at a single objective.

210
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,507
The world's intelligence networks.

211
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,926
The very truth as we know it.

212
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,971
The entire intelligence community is racing

213
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,681
to archive hard copies

214
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,849
of our fact-positive knowledge bases

215
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,893
before our most secure data centers

216
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,853
are breached and corrupted.

217
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,772
Which is only a matter of time.

218
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:47,568
The Entity will know precisely how to undermine our every strength

219
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,695
and exploit our every weakness.

220
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,406
How to turn our allies into enemies

221
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,576
and our enemies into aggressors.

222
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,370
Why not air-gap our intelligence servers?

223
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,706
Cut them off from the outside world entirely?

224
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,124
We already have.

225
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:05,460
But servers require humans to maintain them.

226
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,714
And humans are the weakest link in any security chain,

227
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:12,843
especially when dealing with a godless, stateless, amoral enemy.

228
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,012
One that has been patiently listening,

229
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,763
reading, watching.

230
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:20,601
Harvesting our deepest personal secrets for years.

231
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:25,355
Able to beguile, blackmail, bribe or be anyone it wants.

232
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:29,026
And to manipulate us at will through our total dependence

233
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,029
on a carefully constructed digital reality.

234
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,031
An enemy that is everywhere...

235
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,326
and nowhere...

236
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:38,869
and has no center.

237
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:44,875
All right,

238
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,795
so what you're telling me is the most awesome goddamn intelligence

239
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:51,214
and tactical apparatus on the planet

240
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,967
has no way of killing this thing.

241
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,720
You don't want to kill it, sir.

242
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,931
You want to control it.

243
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,434
And how do we do that, Mr. Kittridge?

244
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,563
The CIA's assets in the Kremlin informed us

245
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,231
that the Russians have focused

246
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:11,151
the majority of their intelligence activity

247
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:14,571
on acquiring two halves of a cruciform key.

248
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:16,740
And what does it unlock?

249
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,825
Not exactly sure.

250
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,411
But the Russians seem to believe that it somehow has

251
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,373
the power to deactivate our mysterious Entity.

252
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,791
Though, ideally...

253
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,087
they hope to control it, harness it.

254
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,256
Do you believe that, Kittridge?

255
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,344
What matters is that the rest of the world believes it.

256
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,347
Japan, India, Germany, and the Brits believe it,

257
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,184
and yet no one, not even our closest allies,

258
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:47,062
have willingly whispered one word of it to us.

259
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,731
Which would indicate that there's a global race on

260
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,526
to acquire the two halves of this key.

261
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,945
Every nation in it for themselves,

262
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,572
not to kill this thing, sir,

263
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:59,950
but to weaponize it.

264
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,368
And in so doing,

265
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:06,164
establish a new, incontestable form of global dominance.

266
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:07,958
How do we find this key first?

267
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,545
Well, we know that a buyer is passing somewhere through the Middle East

268
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:14,548
sometime in the next 72 hours.

269
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,759
We believe that he already has one half of this key.

270
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,678
- You believe. - At this point,

271
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,280
we can't be certain it's not a counterfeit.

272
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,848
How would you verify that?

273
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:26,017
The only thing that can authenticate one genuine half of the key

274
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:28,311
is the other genuine half of the key.

275
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,455
Its true mate, if you will.

276
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,773
We think it's some sort of fail-safe.

277
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,150
How do we find its mate?

278
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,611
Well, we believe the other genuine half of the key

279
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,071
was in the hands of this woman.

280
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,198
Who is she?

281
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,700
Ilsa Faust.

282
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,285
Former British Intelligence.

283
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,326
Where is she now?

284
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:48,039
- She's dead, sir. - She was... excuse me...

285
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:51,626
killed by mercenaries looking to collect a bounty.

286
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,003
And who put up the bounty?

287
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,505
Given her body of work, could have been anyone.

288
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,632
So anyone could have her half of the key?

289
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,051
Hmm, not just anyone.

290
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,263
I sent a man to find her,

291
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:06,349
the only man she would have entrusted with her half of the key.

292
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,226
Does he have it, Kittridge?

293
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,272
Well, at present, I don't know that, sir. He's refused to come in.

294
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:14,399
- Refused? - Hmm.

295
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,401
Who the hell is this guy?

296
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,028
That's classified.

297
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:21,198
I'm the goddamn Director of National Intelligence.

298
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,241
What exactly is it I'm not supposed to know about?

299
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,409
The IMF.

300
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:25,994
- Mr. Kittridge. - The world bank.

301
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,472
No, that's the International Monetary Fund.

302
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,496
Mr. Kittridge.

303
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:31,041
No, I mean the other IMF. Ours.

304
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,584
What does it stand for?

305
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,128
Impossible Mission Force.

306
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:37,422
You're not serious.

307
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,341
I'm afraid he is.

308
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,051
And what do they do exactly?

309
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,387
It's just as the name implies. Whatever the rest of us can't.

310
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,711
- And who is in charge? - They're not ones to take orders

311
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:47,849
in the traditional sense.

312
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,351
We more or less...

313
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:52,604
leave word.

314
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,024
Leave... word.

315
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,651
Mr. Kittridge, sir.

316
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,337
The IMF operates outside the community

317
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,279
and answers directly to the president.

318
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,781
So let me get this straight.

319
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:05,659
When there's a mission none of you can handle...

320
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:10,455
you just leave word for a nameless man

321
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,708
and hope he gets the job done.

322
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:14,793
Is that it?

323
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,879
Should he choose to accept it.

324
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:21,508
What the hell kind of outfit gets to choose what orders to accept?

325
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,218
The IMF was expressly created

326
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:27,055
to ensure there would be no unintended consequences.

327
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:30,225
If they cannot ensure a mission's ultimate outcome,

328
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,977
they're authorized to decline.

329
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,238
I understand.

330
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:27,365
You're upset.

331
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,743
I'm not upset, Kittridge.

332
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,829
You wanted me to listen.

333
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,083
This is me listening.

334
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,128
All right.

335
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,088
I put the bounty on Ilsa's head.

336
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:44,299
I also told you how to find her!

337
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:46,885
I didn't ask her to steal the key.

338
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:50,388
She did that for reasons of her own. But...

339
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:53,433
that's the pattern, isn't it?

340
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:59,898
You get her out of trouble, and she always found her way back in.

341
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:12,202
Wait! Ilsa!

342
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,871
- Ilsa, wait! It's me! - What?

343
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:15,955
It's me.

344
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:23,880
It's okay.

345
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:00,417
Listen to me! You're dead! You stay dead!

346
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,502
Ethan, wait!

347
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:09,509
I'm not going to apologize to you, Hunt.

348
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,886
It's my job to use you.

349
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,764
Just like it's your job to be of use.

350
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:18,351
Did you accomplish your mission or not?

351
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,608
Wherever the other half of this is,

352
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,987
whatever the completed key unlocks,

353
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,363
I will find it.

354
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,575
And then what?

355
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:37,495
No one should be trusted with control of the Entity.

356
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,914
I mean to kill it.

357
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:41,041
Ethan,

358
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:43,626
the next world war isn't gonna be a cold one.

359
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,336
It's gonna be a shooting war,

360
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,715
it's gonna be a ballistic war over a rapidly shrinking ecosystem.

361
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,676
It's gonna be a war for the last of our dwindling energy,

362
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,262
drinkable water, breathable air.

363
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:58,349
Whoever controls the Entity controls the truth.

364
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:02,062
The concepts of right and wrong

365
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:06,399
can be clearly defined for everyone for centuries to come.

366
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,234
Do you even hear yourself?

367
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:13,198
Your days of fighting for the so-called greater good

368
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:15,658
are over.

369
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:18,161
You need to pick a side.

370
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:21,539
I'm on the same side I've always been on.

371
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,043
Stay out of my way.

372
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:27,170
I can't do that.

373
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,340
We're gonna be coming after you.

374
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,634
The world's gonna be coming after you.

375
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:36,596
And one way or another, this mission of yours

376
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,558
is gonna cost you dearly.

377
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,945
If I don't get that, we're gonna have company real soon.

378
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:10,588
Hello?

379
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,257
Director Denlinger, please.

380
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,510
Uh, Director is unavailable at the moment.

381
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:17,393
- How can I help you? - To whom am I speaking?

382
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,722
CIA Director Eugene Kittridge.

383
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:20,807
Designator?

384
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,517
"Bassnote," lowercase, all one word.

385
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,853
Sir, we have a situation.

386
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:25,937
No kidding.

387
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,314
Your adjutant was found unconscious

388
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:29,899
in his home ten minutes ago.

389
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,276
It appears he was drugged.

390
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,986
I understand.

391
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:34,279
I don't think you do, sir.

392
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:36,739
Security has him entering this facility

393
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:39,409
- fifteen minutes ago. - I understand, thank you.

394
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,953
Are you able to speak freely?

395
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,288
No, thank you.

396
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,123
A security team is on their way.

397
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:48,209
Ifyou're in any danger, simply hang up the phone before I count to five.

398
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:50,003
One, two...

399
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,801
So just how do you plan on getting out of here?

400
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:03,391
Of course.

401
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,545
Listen up.

402
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:17,423
An American operative with a grievance against his country

403
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:19,926
is missing and has malfunctioned.

404
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:22,929
His agenda represents a threat to our national interests,

405
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:25,473
and he must be neutralized at all cost.

406
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,433
Anything in this man's possession

407
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:31,104
is of vital importance and must be captured intact.

408
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:35,942
The man himself is expendable. He is not to be underestimated.

409
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:38,403
A master of infiltration, deception,

410
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:40,613
sabotage and psych warfare.

411
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:43,283
For all intents and purposes, ladies and gentlemen,

412
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:46,202
a mind-reading, shape-shifting incarnation of chaos.

413
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:48,371
So, for your safety

414
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,790
and the safety of those around you,

415
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:52,667
do not consider him secure

416
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,337
unless you have driven a wooden stake through his open heart.

417
00:29:57,255 --> 00:29:58,881
This is not a drill.

418
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:04,137
A self-aware, self-learning,

419
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,639
truth-eating digital parasite

420
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,809
infesting all of cyberspace.

421
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,771
Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later.

422
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:16,441
And the two halves of this key just might provide

423
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:19,736
the means of controlling this Entity.

424
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,405
Meaning every government on the planet would kill us

425
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:23,990
just to get that key.

426
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,074
Including our own.

427
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,242
Exactly.

428
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,369
Putting us on an unsanctioned mission

429
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:31,039
which has gone rogue before it even started.

430
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:33,708
Meaning this very conversation

431
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:36,044
is technically an act of treason.

432
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:39,380
Or as we like to call it, Monday.

433
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:42,675
So what's the play?

434
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,470
A buyer's coming in on Flight 746 from Amsterdam

435
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:47,096
for a 30-minute layover

436
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,099
at which time he is hoping to purchase that half of the key.

437
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:51,934
And it stands to reason

438
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:54,858
the buyer will have the other half of the key somewhere on their person.

439
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,899
Being the only way to authenticate our half.

440
00:30:57,982 --> 00:30:59,859
So how do we identify the buyer?

441
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:02,904
This Geiger counter will detect a radiological signature

442
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,198
of the dragon's egg embedded in the buyer's key.

443
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:08,201
The augmented-reality overlay in these glasses

444
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:09,827
will lead us to it.

445
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:12,955
Oh, that's very clever.

446
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,417
So, you ID the buyer, pick his pockets,

447
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:17,835
- Bob's your uncle. - No.

448
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,712
No. Of course not.

449
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:21,255
The complete key is of no value

450
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:22,659
if we don't know what it unlocks.

451
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:25,218
So you're going to sell the buyer

452
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,552
our half of the key.

453
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:29,097
While we figure out the buyer's connecting flight

454
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,140
and book you a seat on that plane.

455
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:34,143
So you can follow the key wherever it goes.

456
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:37,355
Which you hope is into the hands of someone who knows what it unlocks.

457
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:38,439
Precisely.

458
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:40,441
Finding the completed key

459
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,860
is only the beginning.

460
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:45,571
The fate of the world depends on finding

461
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:47,907
whatever it unlocks.

462
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,579
This guy, you know him?

463
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:56,541
Not personally.

464
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:58,292
But it is personal.

465
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:29,866
Thank you.

466
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:37,915
- Hey, what's that? - What?

467
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:41,502
Security alert. Suspicious bag on its way to Venice.

468
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:43,504
Nope, it's gone. Must have been a false alarm.

469
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:54,223
Overwatch, Snap Shot. Where's he at?

470
00:32:58,186 --> 00:32:59,937
Snap Shot, Overwatch. I have him.

471
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:02,398
Terminal B, Gate 15, headed south.

472
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:06,819
- I am so. - You are not.

473
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:10,698
Ethan, would you care to explain to our friend the Net Ranger

474
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,825
how I am just as capable of writing code as he is?

475
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:13,910
No comment.

476
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:15,661
What, you figure Phineas Phreak here

477
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:17,973
is gonna single-handedly work out a way to kill the Entity

478
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,957
while I just hold his soldering iron?

479
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,751
- Probably. - Definitely.

480
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:24,795
Out of the way!

481
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:26,547
Tell me where he is.

482
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:28,257
- Where is he? - Blue suit.

483
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:29,842
Right in front of you.

484
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:43,898
Oh!

485
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:54,283
Oh! Ah! Ow!

486
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:56,285
It's not him.

487
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,370
It's him.

488
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:58,597
I'm telling you, it's not him.

489
00:33:58,621 --> 00:33:59,705
And I'm telling you

490
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:01,624
facial comes back with a perfect...

491
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:07,213
How did you do that?

492
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:10,007
No one is safe from Phineas Phreak.

493
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:19,016
I got him.

494
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,602
- Where is he? - Terminal E, Gate 5.

495
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:24,355
Goddamn it, that's clear on the other side of the airport.

496
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:29,610
Ethan, they're headed to Terminal E.

497
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:32,196
That side of the airport is all yours.

498
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:34,072
Thank you, Luther.

499
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:35,449
- I see the buyer. - Got him.

500
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:38,536
The buyer is Otto Von Bork. Swiss national.

501
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,037
He's connecting to Venice,

502
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:42,999
departing in 30 minutes on Flight 1031.

503
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:45,042
Benji, get me on that flight to Venice.

504
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:47,628
Yep, Flight 1031 to Venice. Stand by.

505
00:34:58,598 --> 00:34:59,599
What?

506
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:01,892
Ethan, what just happened?

507
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:03,477
- He was bumped. - Bumped?

508
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:04,812
What do you mean, bumped?

509
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,856
That woman picked his pocket. Tag her.

510
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,107
Tell me who she is.

511
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:18,451
Luther, mute our comms.

512
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:19,869
What is it?

513
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:21,430
That bag was on its way to Flight 1031.

514
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:22,788
What bag?

515
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:25,249
There was a suspicious bag alert, a few minutes ago.

516
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:26,333
So what about it?

517
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,127
It was on its way to Flight 1031.

518
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,338
To Venice. It's the buyer's plane.

519
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:31,505
It's Ethan's plane.

520
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:33,966
Luther, do you copy? Who is she?

521
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,676
What if it wasn't a false alarm?

522
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,863
What if somebody's trying to smuggle a bomb onto that plane?

523
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:41,599
And what if that's what the Entity wants us to think to keep Ethan off that plane?

524
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,744
- Luther, what's happening? - Should we warn him?

525
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:46,395
- No. - Guys, guys? Do you hear me?

526
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:47,480
Find that bag.

527
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:49,231
I'll direct you. Go.

528
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:51,567
Luther, just tell me, is there something wrong?

529
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:54,945
Nothing to worry about. It's under control.

530
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:56,029
Got her.

531
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,658
Info on the woman is coming now.

532
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:01,786
Whoa.

533
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:05,581
Whoever she is, she's no spy.

534
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,667
She's a thief.

535
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,085
Where am I going, Luther?

536
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:11,379
Benji, there's a door on your immediate left.

537
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:13,547
I'm unlocking it now.

538
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:20,638
The bag you're after is on tray 01833

539
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:23,557
heading towards the northwest corner of the facility.

540
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:24,767
Copy that!

541
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,821
Hi.

542
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,282
Hello.

543
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,413
Oh, I get it.

544
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:48,082
You thought I was someone else.

545
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:51,627
I'm not interested.

546
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:54,463
Give me a chance.

547
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,298
I'll scream.

548
00:36:58,175 --> 00:36:59,385
Please do.

549
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:03,806
What do you want?

550
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,058
This key.

551
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:10,396
The one you picked from that man's pocket.

552
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:11,939
It's worthless

553
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:13,023
without this key.

554
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:16,944
But together

555
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:18,747
they're worth four million in cryptocurrency

556
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:20,531
that man was carrying on a flash drive.

557
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,410
Well, I wouldn't know anything about that.

558
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,078
Then why was this drive in your pocket?

559
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:29,498
Who are you?

560
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:31,250
You working with someone?

561
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:34,295
Never. I'm strictly single-0.

562
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:36,088
Today you got a partner.

563
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:38,549
I need the man you stole this from to complete a transaction

564
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:40,468
and leave this airport with both of these

565
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:43,613
without ever knowing his pocket was picked and before he boards his flight in...

566
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:45,931
- Seven minutes. - Seven minutes.

567
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:49,351
We both know you're a good pickpocket.

568
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,353
Let's see what kind of put-pocket you are.

569
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,858
You expect me to put it back.

570
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,985
Oh, I know you will.

571
00:37:58,068 --> 00:37:59,236
You're a thief.

572
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,614
You want the money. And I can give it to you.

573
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:04,200
Your choice.

574
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:06,827
You're in or you're out.

575
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:10,706
All right.

576
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,874
So what's the play?

577
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:14,001
I sure hope you know whatyou're doing.

578
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:15,795
After you.

579
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:20,466
Oh, I won't be needing this.

580
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:22,092
I don't smoke.

581
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:25,971
Keep it. Something to remember me by.

582
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:35,940
Ethan, the alloy in that key she took off the buyer doesn't match.

583
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:37,024
It's counterfeit.

584
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:38,692
I expect nothing less.

585
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:40,402
But that doesn't change our objective.

586
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:42,006
The buyer has to leave with both keys.

587
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:43,906
Talk to me, Luther! Where am I going?

588
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,908
Benji, head down the stairs in front of you

589
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,409
and the bag should be right there.

590
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:48,994
Okay. I'm there. I'm there.

591
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:51,664
Uh...

592
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,668
That's him.

593
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:57,044
Right in front ofyou.

594
00:38:58,963 --> 00:39:01,799
Okay, okay. Hey, sorry. Thought you were somebody else.

595
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,678
Hunt's jerking our chain.

596
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:09,390
Everybody! Two-man teams, spread out.

597
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:12,434
Ethan, our American friends are getting wise.

598
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:14,120
They're breaking up and canvassing the airport.

599
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,563
Keep your eyes peeled.

600
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:17,398
So, what do I call you?

601
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:19,817
How about Grace? And you?

602
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,735
Well, listen, Grace.

603
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:23,672
You should know we're not the only interested party.

604
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:25,489
If I tell you to run, you run.

605
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:27,157
Run?

606
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:28,534
This is getting exciting.

607
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:30,661
Benji, have you got that bag?

608
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:31,912
I found it!

609
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:48,596
There's a cylindrical device inside.

610
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,805
I'm gonna take it out.

611
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,644
How we doing, Luther?

612
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:58,105
Ethan, the buyer's in the waiting area above you.

613
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:00,024
Top of the escalator.

614
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:03,736
All units are headed in your direction.

615
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:07,114
Your location is going to be crawling with agents any time now.

616
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,334
Whatever it is, I've just activated it.

617
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:23,547
Uh, looks like we have five minutes.

618
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,426
- Also, it appears to be nuclear. - How big?

619
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,012
Big enough to matter to everybody in this airport, I suspect.

620
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,014
- Can you disarm it? - I haven't got any tools!

621
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,308
- Then find some. - Where am I gonna find...

622
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:00,000
Is this where we run?

623
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:01,669
Not yet.

624
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,463
Benji, how are you doing with that bomb?

625
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:05,547
Come on, come on.

626
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,133
I got it!

627
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:12,554
It's a cylinder cypher. There's eight wheels.

628
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,848
Looks like 14 letters on each wheel.

629
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:17,476
1.5 billion possible combinations.

630
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:18,894
Give or take.

631
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,355
Oh, my God.

632
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:22,898
What now?

633
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:25,526
The wheels, they spell out a message.

634
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:27,194
U.R.DUNN.

635
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:28,862
No way. Not yet we aren't.

636
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:30,823
No, Luther, not D-O-N-E.

637
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:33,325
D-U-N-N.

638
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:35,244
It's my last name.

639
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,874
It knows who I am.

640
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:55,484
Hold on. There's a message on the display.

641
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:57,474
"I speak without a mouth.

642
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:59,977
I fly through the air without wings.

643
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,687
- What am I?" - You got me. What?

644
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,273
It's a riddle. I suspect this thing is voice-activated.

645
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:05,556
It wants me to say the answer.

646
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:07,234
"I fly through the air..."

647
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,486
An echo!

648
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,280
That's it! That's it!

649
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:12,698
Okay, new message.

650
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:15,367
"Are you afraid of death?"

651
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:17,661
- What kind of a riddle is that? - It's not a riddle.

652
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:19,913
It's a psychometric test.

653
00:42:19,997 --> 00:42:23,667
The more questions you answer, the more it'll know about you.

654
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:25,669
"Are you afraid of death?" No!

655
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:29,965
- Did it work? - I lied. It knows.

656
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:32,301
Just tell it the truth. Say it.

657
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:35,179
"Are you afraid of death?" Yes! Who isn't?

658
00:42:36,847 --> 00:42:38,182
Pardon.

659
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:48,901
Okay, "What's always approaching but never arrives?" Um...

660
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:50,194
Wait, I know this one.

661
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:51,695
The clock is ticking, Luther.

662
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:53,819
Riddles aren't my thing, Benji. What more can I say?

663
00:42:53,864 --> 00:42:55,365
We're running out of time!

664
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:59,453
There he is. Oh, this is too easy.

665
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:01,371
Sorry to bother you, Ethan.

666
00:43:01,455 --> 00:43:04,666
Would you happen to know what's always approaching

667
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,126
but never arrives?

668
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:08,545
What is always approaching but never arrives?

669
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:09,713
Tomorrow.

670
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:11,255
What?

671
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:13,760
Always approaching but never arrives: Tomorrow.

672
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,220
- It's tomorrow. - Tomorrow.

673
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:17,846
Tomorrow! Tomorrow!

674
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,556
Yes! Okay, next question.

675
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,766
Give me the goods.

676
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:22,726
I'll be watching.

677
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,103
Why, you don't trust me?

678
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,610
Luther, what is happening?

679
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:34,571
Nothing to worry about. Everything is under control.

680
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:35,823
Okay, next question:

681
00:43:35,906 --> 00:43:39,034
"Who or what is the most important thing to you?"

682
00:43:39,785 --> 00:43:40,994
- Say it. - But if I...

683
00:43:41,078 --> 00:43:42,454
There's no other choice. Say it.

684
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:44,373
My friends.

685
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:46,749
Bastard.

686
00:43:58,387 --> 00:44:00,389
- Is he... - Yes, he is.

687
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,349
Give me the money, give me the key.

688
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:06,061
Okay. "What gets bigger the more you take away?"

689
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:08,480
- A hole. - A hole. Brilliant!

690
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,320
I've got no more questions and there's one more wheel.

691
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:24,597
How am I supposed to give answers if I've got no questions?

692
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:26,039
That must be your final test.

693
00:44:26,123 --> 00:44:27,791
I've got 45 seconds!

694
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:32,629
What happens now?

695
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:34,715
I'm thinking. Don't move.

696
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:36,192
Luther, I'm pinned down. Need a way out.

697
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:37,342
Where am I going?

698
00:44:37,426 --> 00:44:38,760
We have a bigger problem, Ethan.

699
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:41,138
It's very possible no one is getting out of here.

700
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,515
- What? - There's a bomb in baggage handling.

701
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,683
A nuclear bomb.

702
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:47,561
The question I asked you is part of the code for disarming it.

703
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:48,729
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

704
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:52,065
Why didn't you tell me this?

705
00:44:52,149 --> 00:44:54,359
You had a lot going on. We didn't want to bother you.

706
00:44:54,443 --> 00:44:58,197
Listen to me. A nuclear bomb is something you bother me with immediately.

707
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,740
- How much time? - Twenty seconds.

708
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:01,575
Twenty seconds?

709
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:02,659
There's one more riddle.

710
00:45:02,743 --> 00:45:04,095
I'm working on it. Fifteen seconds!

711
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,079
Easy, easy. What's the riddle?

712
00:45:06,163 --> 00:45:08,266
In the time it takes me to explain, we'll all be dead!

713
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:09,970
- Come on, Benji. - Why do we always end up

714
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,084
in these situations?

715
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:12,669
Ten seconds.

716
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:14,254
Nine... eight...

717
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:17,507
seven... six... five...

718
00:45:19,635 --> 00:45:21,136
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

719
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:29,978
Oh, my God.

720
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:31,062
What is it?

721
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:33,607
It's empty.

722
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,108
What do you mean, empty?

723
00:45:35,192 --> 00:45:36,443
There's nothing inside.

724
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:42,908
She took the key.

725
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:43,907
Which key?

726
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:44,993
Our key. The real key.

727
00:45:45,077 --> 00:45:46,117
- What? - Luther, find her.

728
00:45:56,463 --> 00:45:58,048
I got her. She's headed for Terminal E.

729
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:11,603
No, it can't be.

730
00:46:11,687 --> 00:46:12,603
What is it?

731
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,690
Luther, Benji. Abort. Get out!

732
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:16,858
- Where do we rendezvous? - We don't!

733
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:19,611
This mission is terminated. Get out now.

734
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:33,083
Hunt! Stop right there!

735
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,836
- Hey! - You see him? Where is he?

736
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:37,713
Excuse me! Excuse me!

737
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:40,007
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

738
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,621
Move!

739
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:19,713
- Move! - Move, move!

740
00:48:01,797 --> 00:48:03,840
He's got to be here somewhere.

741
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:06,843
Goddamn.

742
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:20,023
What we have here is shortwave radio,

743
00:48:20,107 --> 00:48:24,111
magnetic audio recording, cathode ray tube monitors.

744
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:26,696
No more ones and zeros.

745
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:30,367
It's a fully analog, offline safe room,

746
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,869
shielded from our digitally-based Entity.

747
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:36,623
Where is this feed coming from?

748
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:39,376
CORONA spy satellite from the Cold War.

749
00:48:40,627 --> 00:48:42,462
Had no idea we were still using those things.

750
00:48:42,546 --> 00:48:44,214
Yeah, well, we weren't.

751
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:46,508
Gave them to the National Weather Service 20 years ago.

752
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,677
This is the last one still functioning.

753
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,806
So, will this thing help us find your nameless IMF man?

754
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:54,850
Nothing can do that, sir.

755
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:58,353
But it has allowed us to keep tabs on this woman.

756
00:49:00,439 --> 00:49:03,316
She was seen with our man at the airport in Abu Dhabi.

757
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:05,402
Who is she?

758
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:07,988
Where is she now?

759
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:20,584
You are here

760
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:23,420
because Italian police received an anonymous tip

761
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:25,422
that a woman matching your description

762
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:28,758
would be arriving on the afternoon flight from Abu Dhabi.

763
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:32,762
This woman had multiple passports in her possession.

764
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:36,933
This one is wanted for fraud in Saint Petersburg.

765
00:49:37,017 --> 00:49:40,854
Jewel theft in Antwerp. Art theft in Monaco.

766
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:44,191
Graft in Milan. Extortion in Mumbai.

767
00:49:44,274 --> 00:49:46,776
But this is my favorite:

768
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,945
resisting arrest in Rio.

769
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:52,824
Which leads me to wonder...

770
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:55,911
which one of these women is you?

771
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:59,122
I've never seen these before in my life.

772
00:49:59,206 --> 00:50:00,624
They were in your purse.

773
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:03,627
And your picture is in every one.

774
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,879
- May I see? - Please.

775
00:50:11,593 --> 00:50:13,220
Yes, it's an amazing likeness,

776
00:50:13,303 --> 00:50:14,930
but it isn't me.

777
00:50:16,223 --> 00:50:17,724
As I keep telling you, I'm...

778
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:20,560
I'm a schoolteacher from Brighton.

779
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:22,187
I'm on a sabbatical.

780
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,397
Whatever you're involved in,

781
00:50:24,481 --> 00:50:27,943
you've obviously made some very powerful enemies.

782
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:37,786
Sì.

783
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:39,538
Okay.

784
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,251
Her lawyer is here.

785
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:46,169
My lawyer?

786
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:23,623
Magistrate Spezzi.

787
00:51:23,707 --> 00:51:25,584
I'm sorry, who are you?

788
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,168
Interpol.

789
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:32,924
I've come regarding the arrest of the woman from Abu Dhabi.

790
00:51:33,008 --> 00:51:36,595
I'll need to inventory the items on her person at the time of her arrest.

791
00:51:36,678 --> 00:51:39,264
May I see some identification, please?

792
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:41,516
Where's the rest?

793
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:44,060
I assure you, this is everything.

794
00:51:44,144 --> 00:51:45,478
What was your name?

795
00:51:45,562 --> 00:51:47,480
She left Abu Dhabi with a certain key.

796
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:49,441
There was no key.

797
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:51,359
It was an unusual sort.

798
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:54,446
One that you could mistake for a pendant.

799
00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:59,200
The kind that you'd be tempted to hang on a chain

800
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:00,827
around Amelia's neck.

801
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:03,622
Amelia?

802
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:05,624
Your wife.

803
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:09,669
Mother of your lovely daughter Serena.

804
00:52:09,753 --> 00:52:10,754
You're not Interpol.

805
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:13,173
I am if I wish to be.

806
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:17,969
I can be anything, and I know everything.

807
00:52:18,053 --> 00:52:21,806
I know this wouldn't be the first time you've helped yourself to stolen goods.

808
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:22,932
A Cartier bracelet.

809
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:25,685
You were cleared of suspicion,

810
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:27,849
but we both know you gave it to your mistress Valeria

811
00:52:27,896 --> 00:52:31,733
on August 21st, her 29th birthday.

812
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:33,777
Who are you?

813
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:37,947
I'm gonna have to search you,

814
00:52:38,031 --> 00:52:39,240
just to be sure.

815
00:52:43,662 --> 00:52:46,206
Your secretary's no longer with us.

816
00:53:24,494 --> 00:53:26,037
You.

817
00:53:26,121 --> 00:53:27,664
You did this.

818
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:29,207
I called the police.

819
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:32,168
I didn't tell them about your colorful past.

820
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:35,338
That's on you.

821
00:53:35,422 --> 00:53:37,966
You put-pocketed that key on another passenger

822
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:39,676
before you were arrested.

823
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:42,554
You exchanged details and arranged to meet later on.

824
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:43,722
Right now,

825
00:53:43,805 --> 00:53:45,366
someone out there hasn't the slightest clue

826
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,950
they're holding on to that key for you.

827
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:49,394
An unwitting courier.

828
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:50,478
The perfect accomplice.

829
00:53:51,771 --> 00:53:54,399
I'm guessing a man, middle-aged?

830
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:57,110
A man waiting his whole life

831
00:53:57,193 --> 00:53:59,612
to be noticed by a woman like you.

832
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:02,240
An orphan.

833
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:06,953
Highly intelligent. Inherently resourceful.

834
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:10,540
Growing up in poverty left you longing for the finer things.

835
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:12,876
Other people's things.

836
00:54:13,752 --> 00:54:17,922
Someone saw your potential and helped you hone your skills.

837
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:20,508
Skills that gave you the life you thought you wanted.

838
00:54:20,592 --> 00:54:23,970
Tailored clothes, fine dining, luxury hotels.

839
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:27,015
Skills that kept you one step ahead of the law...

840
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:29,267
until now.

841
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:34,063
You can't blame a girl for trying to make a dishonest living.

842
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:39,819
You had no idea what you were stealing. Otherwise, you never would have stolen it.

843
00:54:41,613 --> 00:54:42,614
Tell you what.

844
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:44,032
You get me out of here,

845
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:46,242
and I'll take you straight to the key.

846
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:47,786
I have a better idea.

847
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:49,454
You're gonna tell me everything.

848
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:51,581
Then I'll think about getting you out of here.

849
00:54:51,664 --> 00:54:53,792
Now start with who hired you.

850
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:56,878
And don't lie to me because I'll know.

851
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,713
I have no idea who hired me.

852
00:54:58,797 --> 00:55:01,132
Contact with the client was almost entirely electronic.

853
00:55:01,216 --> 00:55:02,217
- Email? - Texts.

854
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,551
- Encrypted? - Naturally.

855
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:05,136
- Almost? - Pardon?

856
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,139
You said contact with the client was almost entirely electronic.

857
00:55:08,223 --> 00:55:10,683
There was a dead drop in a café in Luxembourg.

858
00:55:10,767 --> 00:55:12,519
- An envelope. - What was in the envelope?

859
00:55:12,602 --> 00:55:14,354
A ticket to Abu Dhabi.

860
00:55:15,522 --> 00:55:16,648
And...

861
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:19,943
a picture of you.

862
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:23,988
My instructions were to follow you at the airport.

863
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,365
You'd be tailing a mark.

864
00:55:25,448 --> 00:55:26,658
Said mark would have a key

865
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:28,618
and four million in cryptocurrency.

866
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,829
That drive was useless, by the way. It was empty.

867
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:34,874
The only hope I have of getting paid is to deliver your half of the key.

868
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,418
And you were instructed to deliver it to?

869
00:55:37,502 --> 00:55:38,586
Venice.

870
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:40,839
Party at Ducale Palace. Tomorrow. Midnight.

871
00:55:44,676 --> 00:55:45,885
You expecting someone?

872
00:55:45,969 --> 00:55:49,430
Your friends from the airport. Saw them in the hallway a few minutes ago.

873
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:54,310
You could have said something sooner.

874
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:56,604
Well, they were chasing you, not me.

875
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:20,962
A pervertito!

876
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:24,299
No, Grace, Grace.

877
00:56:26,593 --> 00:56:27,594
No, no, no.

878
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,681
Grazie.

879
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:33,349
Grace.

880
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:40,106
No, no. No.

881
00:56:41,316 --> 00:56:43,985
Tranquillo. Tranquillo.

882
00:57:12,388 --> 00:57:14,724
No, no! Move! Move!

883
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:18,937
Sorry!

884
00:57:30,365 --> 00:57:31,658
Come on.

885
00:57:35,828 --> 00:57:37,121
Who parks like that?

886
00:57:55,598 --> 00:57:57,725
Grace! You got to pull over.

887
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:00,061
Grace. Pull over. Listen.

888
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:02,855
I'm trying to help you! Grace!

889
00:58:02,939 --> 00:58:03,940
Aah!

890
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:41,227
Uhh.

891
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:44,272
Are you okay? You okay? No, no, no.

892
00:58:51,112 --> 00:58:52,447
Give me your hand.

893
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,907
Slow, slow, slow. It's okay.

894
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,951
Slow.

895
00:58:57,035 --> 00:58:59,537
Is anything broken? Are you okay? You okay?

896
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,705
Hunt!

897
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:02,582
It's over!

898
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:05,126
Let the girl go.

899
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:06,502
Put the bracelets on.

900
00:59:07,879 --> 00:59:11,174
There you go. Put them on. Do it!

901
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:13,426
It's okay, he's not gonna shoot you.

902
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:25,813
Goddamn it, Degas, get rid of those women.

903
00:59:25,897 --> 00:59:28,232
Hunt, listen to me. Listen to me.

904
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:29,776
Let her go and put them on.

905
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:34,946
It's okay!

906
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:36,909
It's okay! It's okay!

907
00:59:40,161 --> 00:59:42,663
Everybody down! Get down!

908
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:50,004
- Down, down! - Cover, cover! Cover!

909
01:00:20,535 --> 01:00:22,620
- You're driving. - What?

910
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:23,913
No, no, no!

911
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:26,694
Go, go, go. Hit the accelerator.

912
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:28,042
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

913
01:00:32,171 --> 01:00:33,422
Aah!

914
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:38,886
Go, go, go, go, go!

915
01:00:42,181 --> 01:00:43,182
Oh!

916
01:00:55,987 --> 01:00:57,363
Get in!

917
01:00:57,446 --> 01:00:59,115
You're good. Just keep it going.

918
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:00,658
Don't stop, don't stop.

919
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:11,751
Car, car, car.

920
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:23,347
It's okay. Just put your foot on the brake. Start the car.

921
01:01:23,431 --> 01:01:24,765
Wait, wait, wait!

922
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:27,351
- Wh-What's happening? - I'm done. I'm not doing this.

923
01:01:27,435 --> 01:01:29,020
People are chasing us.

924
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:30,980
Yes, they are. You're driving.

925
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:32,231
Now come on.

926
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:05,223
Who is that person?

927
01:02:05,306 --> 01:02:06,724
I have no idea.

928
01:02:11,604 --> 01:02:13,689
- You okay? - I will be when this is over.

929
01:02:16,359 --> 01:02:17,818
Oh, man.

930
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:23,574
It's okay. It's okay.

931
01:02:24,617 --> 01:02:25,701
Whoa!

932
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:37,588
Is there anyone not chasing us?

933
01:02:37,672 --> 01:02:39,548
We got to get rid of this car.

934
01:02:42,343 --> 01:02:43,761
Scooters! Damn it.

935
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:06,659
What are we doing?

936
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:10,496
Finding us a new car.

937
01:03:16,043 --> 01:03:17,128
Whoa! Jesus!

938
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,686
Okay.

939
01:03:50,328 --> 01:03:51,579
Just give me a second.

940
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:52,663
Yeah, mm-hm.

941
01:03:52,747 --> 01:03:54,206
- Thanks. Okay? - Yeah.

942
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:55,708
- You ready? - I'm ready.

943
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:00,546
Wow.

944
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:01,964
- You okay? - Mm-hm.

945
01:04:02,048 --> 01:04:04,467
Yeah, look, I'm sorry. This is...

946
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:06,719
- It's okay. - No, this car, the way they...

947
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:08,405
- It's okay. - No, the way they set them up,

948
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:09,430
sometimes it's just...

949
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:10,848
- Let's go. - It takes me...

950
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:11,932
Let's go.

951
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,924
Now I got you.

952
01:04:53,724 --> 01:04:54,934
Looks like we lost them.

953
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:21,978
Let's just...

954
01:05:22,002 --> 01:05:23,003
Move, move, move!

955
01:05:40,479 --> 01:05:41,981
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby!

956
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:55,911
Wait, what?

957
01:05:56,912 --> 01:05:57,913
No, no, no.

958
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:05,045
Go, go, go!

959
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:10,134
Whoa, that's... Go straight.

960
01:06:17,308 --> 01:06:18,785
Just take your foot off the accelerator.

961
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:19,977
- We're on fire! - No, no, no.

962
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,896
It's the tires. Just try to go straight.

963
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:25,608
- Hang on. - Why is it spinning?

964
01:06:27,193 --> 01:06:28,944
Good, good, good!

965
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:32,948
I've got it, I've got it, I've got it.

966
01:06:34,325 --> 01:06:35,451
Turn right. Down there.

967
01:06:35,534 --> 01:06:36,827
- Right there! - Come on!

968
01:06:45,586 --> 01:06:46,837
Got to go right. Turn right!

969
01:06:49,632 --> 01:06:51,800
- Who's driving? - You're driving.

970
01:06:51,884 --> 01:06:53,594
Go, go, go. Just go straight.

971
01:06:54,637 --> 01:06:58,057
Go, go, go. Just keep going straight.

972
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:01,560
Or left. Go, go, go. You're doing good.

973
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:08,943
Cops! A lot of cops!

974
01:07:10,236 --> 01:07:11,737
Take the wheel.

975
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:12,820
Brake, brake, brake.

976
01:07:18,953 --> 01:07:20,162
Okay, your wheel.

977
01:07:22,498 --> 01:07:24,416
- Straight? - Right, right, right.

978
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,501
Got it!

979
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:35,844
- Which way now? - Left, left, left.

980
01:07:43,811 --> 01:07:45,980
Okay. You're good, you're good.

981
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:52,069
That's a person.

982
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:56,490
- Okay, car, car. - I see it!

983
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:24,435
Hit it.

984
01:08:31,734 --> 01:08:32,901
Hang on!

985
01:08:33,611 --> 01:08:34,612
Go, go, go, go.

986
01:08:34,695 --> 01:08:35,779
Aah!

987
01:08:44,538 --> 01:08:46,248
What is happening? Where are we going?

988
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:47,333
I don't know.

989
01:08:48,459 --> 01:08:50,127
Okay, brake, brake, brake!

990
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:20,949
Don't hate me.

991
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:25,913
Grace? Grace!

992
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:42,638
Come on, come on.

993
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:12,418
Ethan!

994
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:13,502
Ethan!

995
01:10:17,464 --> 01:10:19,383
Well, come on.

996
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:16,899
All right. We know Grace has one half of the key.

997
01:11:16,982 --> 01:11:19,568
We also know she's gonna be at the Ducale at midnight.

998
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:23,322
And now we have a pretty good idea as to who will be waiting for her there.

999
01:11:23,405 --> 01:11:25,125
The event is being hosted by none other than

1000
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:28,035
our favorite international arms trafficker and black marketeer,

1001
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:29,286
Alana Mitsopolis.

1002
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:31,205
The White Widow.

1003
01:11:31,288 --> 01:11:34,374
Does she know who you actually are, or does she still think

1004
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:37,085
you're the globally notorious mass murderer John Lark?

1005
01:11:37,169 --> 01:11:38,169
Who says I'm not?

1006
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:41,507
Didn't she put a price on your head in Paris?

1007
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:42,925
She did indeed.

1008
01:11:43,008 --> 01:11:46,220
She and Ethan, they worked it out.

1009
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:47,971
You never did tell me how.

1010
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:49,723
Can we continue, please?

1011
01:11:49,807 --> 01:11:51,141
Right.

1012
01:11:51,225 --> 01:11:53,495
So, assuming we get the complete key at the party tonight,

1013
01:11:53,519 --> 01:11:55,145
we still don't know what it unlocks.

1014
01:11:55,229 --> 01:11:56,730
So we need to find somebody who does.

1015
01:11:56,814 --> 01:11:59,441
The question is where to start looking.

1016
01:11:59,525 --> 01:12:02,694
We figured that the bomb didn't just walk into the airport by itself.

1017
01:12:02,778 --> 01:12:03,938
Right? Somebody put it there.

1018
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:06,532
Somebody working for the Entity.

1019
01:12:06,615 --> 01:12:10,160
This is everything I captured from the security cameras at the airport

1020
01:12:10,244 --> 01:12:12,538
up to the minute everything went haywire.

1021
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:15,791
And this is the feed from your AR sunglasses.

1022
01:12:15,874 --> 01:12:18,919
I've been running facial recognition on everyone in the airport.

1023
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:20,254
See anything strange?

1024
01:12:23,674 --> 01:12:24,967
It's like a ghost.

1025
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:26,718
Ghosts don't have reflections.

1026
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:34,434
The only person in the airport with no identity.

1027
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:38,814
The only man who can't be found anyplace else in the airport

1028
01:12:38,897 --> 01:12:41,066
except that reflection.

1029
01:12:42,276 --> 01:12:43,986
He's being erased.

1030
01:12:44,069 --> 01:12:45,737
In real time.

1031
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:54,204
The Entity.

1032
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:56,707
It's protecting him.

1033
01:12:57,291 --> 01:12:59,293
You saw him, didn't you?

1034
01:13:01,712 --> 01:13:03,130
I wasn't sure.

1035
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:05,883
Well, who is he?

1036
01:13:13,307 --> 01:13:14,725
Someone I thought...

1037
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:18,061
...died a long time ago.

1038
01:13:18,145 --> 01:13:19,813
In another life.

1039
01:13:19,897 --> 01:13:21,899
Before the IMF.

1040
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:25,485
Before I was offered the choice.

1041
01:13:28,864 --> 01:13:30,616
And in a very real sense...

1042
01:13:31,575 --> 01:13:33,410
...he made me who I am today.

1043
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:37,164
Does he have a name?

1044
01:13:37,247 --> 01:13:39,708
He calls himself Gabriel.

1045
01:13:42,711 --> 01:13:44,129
You know him.

1046
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:48,008
There is no knowing him.

1047
01:13:49,301 --> 01:13:51,720
He has no recorded past.

1048
01:13:51,803 --> 01:13:53,430
The Entity made sure of that.

1049
01:13:54,723 --> 01:13:56,183
He's a dark messiah.

1050
01:13:56,266 --> 01:13:59,186
The Entity's chosen messenger.

1051
01:13:59,269 --> 01:14:00,646
And he sees death...

1052
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:05,609
...as a gift he wants to share with the rest of the world.

1053
01:14:06,193 --> 01:14:07,194
How do you know this?

1054
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:10,197
I still have a few friends left in MI6.

1055
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:12,699
Friends who are afraid

1056
01:14:12,783 --> 01:14:15,577
of the British government gaining control of the Entity.

1057
01:14:16,495 --> 01:14:17,996
Any attempt to try to stop them

1058
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,915
would be seen as an act of treason.

1059
01:14:19,998 --> 01:14:22,834
And because you're disavowed, your friends...

1060
01:14:23,752 --> 01:14:25,295
called and asked you for help.

1061
01:14:25,379 --> 01:14:28,048
They knew Gabriel serves the Entity.

1062
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:30,133
They knew he was on his way to Istanbul

1063
01:14:30,217 --> 01:14:33,887
to acquire one half of a cruciform key.

1064
01:14:35,097 --> 01:14:36,556
So...

1065
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,849
...I beat him to it.

1066
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:41,395
And when Kittridge put a bounty on your head...

1067
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:44,439
you went to the desert to hide.

1068
01:14:44,523 --> 01:14:47,275
But somehow the bounty hunters found you anyway.

1069
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:48,443
Yes.

1070
01:14:48,527 --> 01:14:51,154
So, did these friends of yours happen to say

1071
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:52,864
what the key unlocks?

1072
01:14:52,948 --> 01:14:56,618
MI6 suspects it leads somehow to the Entity's source code.

1073
01:14:57,369 --> 01:14:58,704
Source code.

1074
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:01,066
When were you gonna tell me this?

1075
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:03,500
I'm telling you now.

1076
01:15:05,252 --> 01:15:07,629
Your friends at MI6, how'd they contact you?

1077
01:15:07,713 --> 01:15:09,589
Did you speak with them? Face to face?

1078
01:15:09,673 --> 01:15:11,091
I'm disavowed.

1079
01:15:11,174 --> 01:15:12,843
They couldn't risk meeting me in person,

1080
01:15:12,926 --> 01:15:14,928
so all communication...

1081
01:15:17,222 --> 01:15:20,017
Was electronic. Was digital.

1082
01:15:23,895 --> 01:15:25,897
No. We can't be sure that was the Entity.

1083
01:15:25,981 --> 01:15:27,858
We can't be sure it wasn't.

1084
01:15:27,941 --> 01:15:29,443
We can't be sure anything is real

1085
01:15:29,526 --> 01:15:31,319
outside of this very conversation.

1086
01:15:32,988 --> 01:15:34,114
None of you should be here.

1087
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:35,198
- Ethan... - No.

1088
01:15:35,282 --> 01:15:36,658
You don't know Gabriel. I do.

1089
01:15:36,742 --> 01:15:38,618
It's not the killing he enjoys.

1090
01:15:38,702 --> 01:15:40,620
It's the suffering it causes.

1091
01:15:40,704 --> 01:15:42,706
And he knows the best way to get to me...

1092
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:44,708
...is through all of you.

1093
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:47,919
And if Gabriel knows me...

1094
01:15:48,003 --> 01:15:49,588
The Entity knows.

1095
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:51,506
There's a reason he wants me here.

1096
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:53,133
There's...

1097
01:15:53,216 --> 01:15:55,010
There's a reason he wants you here.

1098
01:15:55,093 --> 01:15:56,511
It wants you here.

1099
01:15:56,595 --> 01:16:00,140
"Who or what is the most important thing to you?"

1100
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:03,226
No. You have to go. You all have to go.

1101
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:04,853
Ethan, what if it wants us to leave?

1102
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:06,330
Like you made us leave the airport.

1103
01:16:06,354 --> 01:16:08,857
What if it wants you alone at that party tonight?

1104
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:11,127
Then I go alone. At least I don't have all of you to worry about.

1105
01:16:11,151 --> 01:16:13,361
This is exactly why I didn't want to tell you.

1106
01:16:13,445 --> 01:16:15,697
Ethan, you're playing four-dimensional chess

1107
01:16:15,781 --> 01:16:16,990
with an algorithm.

1108
01:16:17,074 --> 01:16:18,492
The Entity knows who we are.

1109
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:21,369
Any move we make, it's probably considered it.

1110
01:16:21,453 --> 01:16:24,372
Anything we do, we have to assume that it's counting on us to do it.

1111
01:16:24,456 --> 01:16:25,916
If you want to beat this thing,

1112
01:16:25,999 --> 01:16:28,418
you have to start thinking like it.

1113
01:16:28,502 --> 01:16:31,922
Cold, logical, unemotional.

1114
01:16:32,005 --> 01:16:35,425
If that key really does grant control of the Entity,

1115
01:16:35,509 --> 01:16:38,887
Gabriel is the last person on Earth who should have it.

1116
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:40,430
She's right, Ethan.

1117
01:16:40,514 --> 01:16:43,642
Gabriel cannot have that key.

1118
01:16:43,725 --> 01:16:47,521
And none of our lives can matter more than this mission.

1119
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:55,570
I don't accept that.

1120
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:23,932
It's my first time in Venice.

1121
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:29,563
It's mine, too.

1122
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:33,335
Buy you a drink?

1123
01:18:33,418 --> 01:18:35,337
I'm waiting for someone.

1124
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:36,420
So am I.

1125
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:41,468
We can wait together. I'm Gabriel.

1126
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:42,761
If you say so.

1127
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:45,263
And you're Grace.

1128
01:18:55,023 --> 01:18:56,191
I don't have it on me.

1129
01:18:56,274 --> 01:18:57,651
I wouldn't expect you to.

1130
01:18:58,777 --> 01:19:00,445
In any case, I'm not here for the key.

1131
01:19:01,613 --> 01:19:02,614
What do you want?

1132
01:19:02,697 --> 01:19:04,032
Suppose, while we're waiting,

1133
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:05,408
I tell you a little story.

1134
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:07,786
You're obviously not the person I came here to meet.

1135
01:19:07,869 --> 01:19:09,412
It's your story, Grace.

1136
01:19:10,997 --> 01:19:12,415
I know how it ends.

1137
01:19:14,084 --> 01:19:16,461
Let me buy you a drink, and perhaps we can change it.

1138
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:46,074
Let's go to a party.

1139
01:19:53,957 --> 01:19:55,292
Excuse me, sir.

1140
01:19:57,252 --> 01:19:58,628
Would you please follow me?

1141
01:20:00,422 --> 01:20:04,134
It's important you understand that you're not unique.

1142
01:20:05,051 --> 01:20:06,094
Thirty years ago,

1143
01:20:07,053 --> 01:20:08,388
her name was Marie.

1144
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:11,975
The first of many women who trusted our mutual friend.

1145
01:20:12,058 --> 01:20:14,394
Women who all have something he wants.

1146
01:20:15,437 --> 01:20:17,856
Women who are all in over their heads,

1147
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:19,107
or so he tells them.

1148
01:20:19,858 --> 01:20:20,900
Sound familiar?

1149
01:20:21,693 --> 01:20:23,486
What happened to Marie?

1150
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:25,780
Same thing that happens to all the women he uses...

1151
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:29,868
...as well as anyone else who touches that key.

1152
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:32,245
He doesn't care whether people live or die.

1153
01:20:32,329 --> 01:20:35,332
He cares only about his objective.

1154
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:38,873
And right now, the only thing standing in his way...

1155
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:40,503
...is you.

1156
01:20:41,713 --> 01:20:44,132
- Why should I believe you? - You shouldn't.

1157
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:46,634
You've stepped into a world of lies, Grace.

1158
01:20:46,718 --> 01:20:48,053
Nothing anyone says is true.

1159
01:20:48,136 --> 01:20:52,140
Just remember that when he promises to protect you.

1160
01:20:52,223 --> 01:20:53,266
Grace.

1161
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:09,199
It's been a long time, Ethan.

1162
01:21:10,575 --> 01:21:12,660
You should've killed me when you had the chance.

1163
01:21:13,995 --> 01:21:15,830
Good evening, everyone.

1164
01:21:16,748 --> 01:21:18,875
If it isn't John Lark.

1165
01:21:20,126 --> 01:21:21,961
Except it isn't, actually.

1166
01:21:23,129 --> 01:21:25,215
But until you're ready to tell me your real name,

1167
01:21:25,298 --> 01:21:27,634
Lark will have to do.

1168
01:21:28,635 --> 01:21:30,428
It's good to see you, Alana.

1169
01:21:34,015 --> 01:21:36,351
And you're Gabriel, I presume.

1170
01:21:37,394 --> 01:21:40,230
I've heard so very little about you.

1171
01:21:40,313 --> 01:21:43,566
Aren't you so much more handsome in person?

1172
01:21:46,236 --> 01:21:48,279
Such a gentleman, too.

1173
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:54,953
And you must be Grace.

1174
01:21:58,415 --> 01:22:00,667
Should I know you?

1175
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:03,420
I believe you have something for me.

1176
01:22:03,503 --> 01:22:05,338
You hired me.

1177
01:22:05,422 --> 01:22:07,590
Oh, I handpicked you.

1178
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:19,017
Don't!

1179
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:21,770
You don't.

1180
01:22:42,876 --> 01:22:44,043
She doesn't have it.

1181
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:46,671
Where is it?

1182
01:22:46,754 --> 01:22:49,382
It's in the last place you would ever think to look.

1183
01:22:52,343 --> 01:22:54,512
Why don't we go upstairs and have a drink?

1184
01:23:04,856 --> 01:23:06,524
Whoa!

1185
01:23:13,698 --> 01:23:14,741
Damn.

1186
01:23:14,824 --> 01:23:17,827
As most of you know, I am merely a broker.

1187
01:23:17,911 --> 01:23:20,205
I connect a buyer and a seller.

1188
01:23:20,288 --> 01:23:22,415
Sometimes for money, sometimes for information,

1189
01:23:22,499 --> 01:23:25,335
but mostly for friendship.

1190
01:23:26,711 --> 01:23:28,963
I just want everyone to get along.

1191
01:23:30,215 --> 01:23:32,717
With me, especially.

1192
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,887
But the world is changing.

1193
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:37,764
Truth is vanishing.

1194
01:23:37,847 --> 01:23:39,807
War is coming.

1195
01:23:39,891 --> 01:23:43,520
And the key to world domination is, of all things,

1196
01:23:43,603 --> 01:23:44,604
a key.

1197
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:48,316
One with the power to control the Entity.

1198
01:23:49,317 --> 01:23:51,110
One that any government in the world

1199
01:23:51,194 --> 01:23:53,655
would pay a king's ransom to take possession of.

1200
01:23:54,656 --> 01:23:56,407
And some of my dearest friends,

1201
01:23:56,491 --> 01:23:58,660
in this case every major nuclear power

1202
01:23:58,743 --> 01:24:00,161
and a handful of minor ones,

1203
01:24:00,245 --> 01:24:01,996
have asked me to deliver this key.

1204
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,582
Of course, if you do find the key,

1205
01:24:04,666 --> 01:24:07,293
you'll be forced to confront an impossible dilemma.

1206
01:24:07,377 --> 01:24:10,463
Whoever you give the key to will be forever in your debt.

1207
01:24:10,547 --> 01:24:13,967
But to the rest of the world, you'll be an enemy.

1208
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:15,718
Oh, I like her.

1209
01:24:15,802 --> 01:24:18,763
What's your relationship with him?

1210
01:24:18,846 --> 01:24:21,474
Gabriel represents another interested party.

1211
01:24:21,558 --> 01:24:24,477
In fact, this party

1212
01:24:24,561 --> 01:24:28,314
was arranged by that interested party.

1213
01:24:28,398 --> 01:24:30,567
You could even say that this party

1214
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:32,569
is that interested party.

1215
01:25:06,311 --> 01:25:07,312
Is this...

1216
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:09,689
The Entity.

1217
01:25:11,816 --> 01:25:13,735
And so the plot thickens.

1218
01:25:14,861 --> 01:25:17,030
Do I give the key to one of my old friends,

1219
01:25:17,113 --> 01:25:20,617
or do I hand it and my fate over to Gabriel

1220
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:23,202
and his infernal machine?

1221
01:25:25,288 --> 01:25:28,458
What makes you so sure you'll get the completed key?

1222
01:25:29,876 --> 01:25:31,377
You have one half of it.

1223
01:25:31,461 --> 01:25:33,087
And she knows

1224
01:25:34,047 --> 01:25:35,590
where the other half is.

1225
01:25:38,384 --> 01:25:40,386
Assuming you can get it,

1226
01:25:41,846 --> 01:25:45,266
why don't you just keep the key and all that power for yourself?

1227
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:47,310
Because she doesn't know what it unlocks...

1228
01:25:48,144 --> 01:25:49,604
any more than the rest of us.

1229
01:25:51,105 --> 01:25:53,149
So, like it or not, you have to choose a suitor.

1230
01:25:53,232 --> 01:25:57,362
Distastefully put, Lark, but it's true.

1231
01:25:57,445 --> 01:26:00,073
Of course, I know what it unlocks.

1232
01:26:01,449 --> 01:26:03,826
And what's he offering for the key?

1233
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:05,578
As I've explained to Grace before,

1234
01:26:05,662 --> 01:26:07,330
I'm not here for any key,

1235
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:09,874
as I'll have both halves in hand tomorrow.

1236
01:26:10,541 --> 01:26:12,210
What makes you so certain of that?

1237
01:26:12,293 --> 01:26:15,088
You've no idea of the power I represent.

1238
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:18,800
Thousands of quadrillions of computations per millisecond

1239
01:26:18,883 --> 01:26:22,178
subtly manipulating the minds of billions

1240
01:26:22,261 --> 01:26:25,264
while parsing every possible cause and effect,

1241
01:26:25,348 --> 01:26:28,101
every scenario, however implausible,

1242
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:32,605
into a very real map of a most probable next.

1243
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:34,982
And with only a few changes to the present,

1244
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:38,403
the future is all but assured.

1245
01:26:39,654 --> 01:26:41,239
The key will come to me...

1246
01:26:42,281 --> 01:26:43,282
tomorrow...

1247
01:26:44,367 --> 01:26:47,203
on the Orient Express bound for Innsbruck.

1248
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:48,788
Innsbruck?

1249
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:50,123
It knows.

1250
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:53,334
It knows that you've already chosen your suitor.

1251
01:26:53,418 --> 01:26:56,713
It knows that you intend to mate the two halves of the key

1252
01:26:56,796 --> 01:26:58,548
in a desperate grasp for control.

1253
01:26:59,507 --> 01:27:02,343
I, however, have been promised the completed key

1254
01:27:02,427 --> 01:27:04,053
will lay itself at my feet,

1255
01:27:05,138 --> 01:27:08,015
provided someone dies tonight.

1256
01:27:09,392 --> 01:27:10,476
Who?

1257
01:27:11,227 --> 01:27:12,228
Her.

1258
01:27:14,147 --> 01:27:15,148
Or her.

1259
01:27:17,817 --> 01:27:19,819
And you will bear witness, Ethan.

1260
01:27:19,902 --> 01:27:23,906
The key will be mine, and I will be gone.

1261
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:26,534
Like smoke in a hurricane.

1262
01:27:26,617 --> 01:27:29,454
But only after someone you care about dies.

1263
01:27:31,581 --> 01:27:32,915
It is written.

1264
01:27:34,542 --> 01:27:35,543
You see what this is...

1265
01:27:37,128 --> 01:27:38,128
...don't you?

1266
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:40,923
He's afraid.

1267
01:27:42,008 --> 01:27:43,176
It's afraid.

1268
01:27:44,427 --> 01:27:46,095
Somehow it knows we're close.

1269
01:27:47,513 --> 01:27:48,848
Why else would you be here?

1270
01:27:49,432 --> 01:27:50,433
Help me.

1271
01:27:50,516 --> 01:27:53,603
Help me complete the key, and I will kill this thing.

1272
01:27:53,686 --> 01:27:55,396
It knows your every secret, Alana.

1273
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,315
Don't listen to this, this fanatic.

1274
01:27:57,398 --> 01:27:58,816
Help him and you'll die, too.

1275
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:00,985
Help him, everyone dies.

1276
01:28:01,068 --> 01:28:02,361
I'll see you tomorrow.

1277
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:06,115
Alana?

1278
01:28:13,331 --> 01:28:14,707
His fate is written.

1279
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:17,043
Shall we write yours, too?

1280
01:28:18,586 --> 01:28:19,712
Alana.

1281
01:28:22,757 --> 01:28:25,134
I'm sorry... Lark.

1282
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:33,935
Oof!

1283
01:28:36,521 --> 01:28:39,106
For old times' sake, I'll let you choose which one.

1284
01:28:40,358 --> 01:28:42,026
Ilsa...

1285
01:28:42,109 --> 01:28:43,319
or Grace.

1286
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:45,488
Kill him, Zola. Kill him.

1287
01:28:45,571 --> 01:28:46,739
Kill him where he stands!

1288
01:28:46,823 --> 01:28:48,491
The choice is yours then, Alana.

1289
01:28:48,574 --> 01:28:49,867
Though I'll remind you,

1290
01:28:49,951 --> 01:28:51,661
Grace knows where half the key is.

1291
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,415
If anything happens to either of them,

1292
01:28:56,499 --> 01:28:58,000
there is no place on Earth

1293
01:28:58,084 --> 01:29:00,628
where you or your god will be safe from me.

1294
01:29:00,711 --> 01:29:02,505
There's no place that I won't go to kill you.

1295
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:04,340
That is written.

1296
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:06,217
It's good to see you, old friend.

1297
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:42,378
You have made a terrible mistake.

1298
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:44,547
My life is on the line here.

1299
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:47,133
I have to be on that train tomorrow.

1300
01:29:48,551 --> 01:29:50,553
And I have to have that key.

1301
01:29:52,138 --> 01:29:54,974
And I do not care how I get it.

1302
01:29:59,478 --> 01:30:00,478
Don't move.

1303
01:30:06,277 --> 01:30:07,445
Run as far as you can.

1304
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:48,986
What the f...

1305
01:31:52,967 --> 01:31:54,260
Grace! Grace!

1306
01:31:55,261 --> 01:31:56,262
Grace!

1307
01:32:11,569 --> 01:32:13,863
Luther, Benji, ifyou hear me, I need eyes.

1308
01:32:13,946 --> 01:32:16,240
Grace is leaving the Ducale on foot. She has the key.

1309
01:32:16,323 --> 01:32:17,324
We're here. Go.

1310
01:32:17,408 --> 01:32:19,118
Need to find her. Where is she?

1311
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:21,495
Damn it! I've lost picture, I need another satellite.

1312
01:32:21,579 --> 01:32:23,748
Hacking the Russian Zenith 4 spy satellite.

1313
01:32:23,831 --> 01:32:25,916
We're scraping the barrel, but it'll have to do.

1314
01:32:34,592 --> 01:32:35,593
This way!

1315
01:32:54,987 --> 01:32:57,448
Where am I going? Come on, come on.

1316
01:32:57,531 --> 01:32:59,533
- Stand by. - Just hurry.

1317
01:32:59,617 --> 01:33:01,344
She's just north of you, crossing the bridge.

1318
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:02,703
Say again, Benji. Say again.

1319
01:33:02,787 --> 01:33:04,747
Just head north, Ethan. She's crossing the bridge.

1320
01:33:22,223 --> 01:33:24,058
Ethan, take the passage to your right.

1321
01:33:24,141 --> 01:33:25,267
Yeah, I see it!

1322
01:33:25,351 --> 01:33:27,269
Down that narrow alley and turn left.

1323
01:33:27,353 --> 01:33:29,480
- I'm losing picture again. - Looking for another.

1324
01:33:29,563 --> 01:33:33,400
The Entity is knocking out satellites faster than I can hack into them.

1325
01:33:58,884 --> 01:34:00,469
Benji, I don't see her. Where is she?

1326
01:34:00,553 --> 01:34:02,405
Down the narrow alley and turn left.

1327
01:34:02,429 --> 01:34:03,889
Okay, copy that.

1328
01:34:03,973 --> 01:34:05,182
Turn right.

1329
01:34:05,266 --> 01:34:07,893
Sorry, my mistake. I meant left. Another left.

1330
01:34:07,977 --> 01:34:09,436
Oh, my God.

1331
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:12,231
Ethan, our comms have been breached! You're talking to the Entity!

1332
01:34:12,314 --> 01:34:14,650
Turn left. Turn right.

1333
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:15,901
Take the bridge to your left.

1334
01:34:15,985 --> 01:34:17,987
Ethan, that is not me! Do you copy?

1335
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:18,986
Ethan, come in.

1336
01:34:18,988 --> 01:34:20,614
Down the alley to your left.

1337
01:34:20,698 --> 01:34:21,782
Turn left.

1338
01:34:21,866 --> 01:34:23,284
Turn right.

1339
01:34:24,994 --> 01:34:26,287
Try to reestablish comms.

1340
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:28,140
- Wait, where are you going? - To try and find Ethan.

1341
01:34:28,164 --> 01:34:30,332
Go to the end of the alley and turn right.

1342
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:32,918
Ethan, I see Grace about 800 meters in front ofyou.

1343
01:34:33,002 --> 01:34:34,044
Take that passage.

1344
01:34:43,512 --> 01:34:45,431
- Wait! Not that way! - What, why?

1345
01:34:46,098 --> 01:34:47,641
Which way?

1346
01:34:47,725 --> 01:34:49,101
Left or right?

1347
01:34:49,185 --> 01:34:50,769
It doesn't matter.

1348
01:34:50,853 --> 01:34:53,355
W-What do you mean, it doesn't matter? Where is she?

1349
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:55,733
She's on her way to the Minich Bridge...

1350
01:34:57,526 --> 01:34:59,028
...where Gabriel is waiting.

1351
01:35:00,321 --> 01:35:01,989
You will never get there in time.

1352
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:05,159
But you can, Ilsa.

1353
01:35:06,577 --> 01:35:09,580
I know what matters most to you, Ethan.

1354
01:35:09,663 --> 01:35:11,040
This isn't Benji.

1355
01:35:11,123 --> 01:35:12,416
No, it's not.

1356
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,752
But you are done.

1357
01:35:38,651 --> 01:35:39,777
So be it.

1358
01:37:28,093 --> 01:37:29,678
Hah!

1359
01:38:16,183 --> 01:38:18,060
I was hoping it'd be you.

1360
01:38:38,539 --> 01:38:39,748
Aah!

1361
01:38:40,958 --> 01:38:42,167
Aah!

1362
01:39:27,463 --> 01:39:28,797
Guh. Okay.

1363
01:41:48,312 --> 01:41:49,521
I'm sorry.

1364
01:41:50,981 --> 01:41:53,483
- I've forgotten your name. - Luther.

1365
01:41:55,402 --> 01:41:56,403
Benji.

1366
01:41:58,322 --> 01:41:59,323
And her?

1367
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:01,617
Ilsa.

1368
01:42:03,327 --> 01:42:04,453
Were you close?

1369
01:42:05,579 --> 01:42:06,872
You and she?

1370
01:42:07,664 --> 01:42:08,957
In our way.

1371
01:42:11,668 --> 01:42:14,129
- I'm the reason she's dead. - No.

1372
01:42:14,212 --> 01:42:16,548
She's the reason you're alive.

1373
01:42:16,632 --> 01:42:18,467
And that's the truth.

1374
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:20,761
I don't know how to feel about it.

1375
01:42:20,844 --> 01:42:22,387
You probably never will.

1376
01:42:24,222 --> 01:42:25,432
I'm so sorry.

1377
01:42:27,309 --> 01:42:29,853
If there's anything I can do to help...

1378
01:42:29,936 --> 01:42:31,730
That's what we'd like to talk to you about.

1379
01:42:33,774 --> 01:42:36,401
In a little over three hours,

1380
01:42:36,485 --> 01:42:38,070
the White Widow is expected to be

1381
01:42:38,153 --> 01:42:41,156
on the Orient Express to Innsbruck,

1382
01:42:41,239 --> 01:42:43,158
where a buyer is waiting to take receipt

1383
01:42:43,241 --> 01:42:45,243
of the complete and verified key.

1384
01:42:45,327 --> 01:42:47,496
But she doesn't have the complete key.

1385
01:42:47,579 --> 01:42:48,914
That Widow doesn't.

1386
01:42:51,124 --> 01:42:52,501
But ours could.

1387
01:42:52,584 --> 01:42:54,711
What... is that?

1388
01:42:55,796 --> 01:42:57,714
Your chance to be someone else.

1389
01:42:57,798 --> 01:42:59,049
I don't understand.

1390
01:42:59,132 --> 01:43:00,717
We're not gonna lie to you, Grace.

1391
01:43:00,801 --> 01:43:01,968
You're in a lot of trouble.

1392
01:43:02,052 --> 01:43:04,721
No number of fake passports is gonna get you out of this one.

1393
01:43:04,805 --> 01:43:06,306
Governments know who you are.

1394
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:07,808
The White Widow knows.

1395
01:43:07,891 --> 01:43:09,309
And the Entity knows.

1396
01:43:09,393 --> 01:43:12,688
Your future boils down to three options now.

1397
01:43:12,771 --> 01:43:13,772
Prison.

1398
01:43:13,855 --> 01:43:15,148
Death.

1399
01:43:15,232 --> 01:43:16,566
Or the choice.

1400
01:43:16,650 --> 01:43:18,485
The choice?

1401
01:43:18,568 --> 01:43:20,028
At one time or another,

1402
01:43:20,112 --> 01:43:23,156
each of us was in a similar situation to yours.

1403
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:25,784
And each of us was offered the choice.

1404
01:43:25,867 --> 01:43:27,786
The same choice we're offering you now.

1405
01:43:27,869 --> 01:43:29,162
Which is?

1406
01:43:30,288 --> 01:43:31,581
To come with us.

1407
01:43:32,916 --> 01:43:34,251
And be a ghost.

1408
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:12,265
Wait, wait. Stop, stop.

1409
01:45:13,433 --> 01:45:14,935
You're not serious.

1410
01:45:15,018 --> 01:45:17,479
Well, you did say you'd do anything to help.

1411
01:45:17,562 --> 01:45:19,731
And you jump off the train

1412
01:45:19,815 --> 01:45:21,566
with the key?

1413
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:22,566
Yes.

1414
01:45:22,567 --> 01:45:23,569
You.

1415
01:45:24,236 --> 01:45:26,279
- Not us. - Yes.

1416
01:45:27,072 --> 01:45:28,365
And what happens to me?

1417
01:45:28,448 --> 01:45:31,535
You'll be taken into custody by Clandestine Services,

1418
01:45:31,618 --> 01:45:32,911
most likely the same men

1419
01:45:32,994 --> 01:45:35,455
that have been chasing me since Abu Dhabi.

1420
01:45:35,539 --> 01:45:38,166
Shortly thereafter, a man will come to see you.

1421
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:40,126
His name is Eugene Kittridge.

1422
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:43,296
You'll tell him I sent you. That I gave you the choice.

1423
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:46,091
And that you choose to accept.

1424
01:45:47,968 --> 01:45:50,679
And you trust this Kittridge person?

1425
01:45:51,721 --> 01:45:53,598
I trust him to recognize your value.

1426
01:45:55,267 --> 01:45:56,518
He'll want to use you.

1427
01:45:57,561 --> 01:45:59,896
And after that, it's what?

1428
01:46:00,689 --> 01:46:01,773
This?

1429
01:46:02,899 --> 01:46:04,276
When do I get my life back?

1430
01:46:04,359 --> 01:46:05,902
What life?

1431
01:46:06,528 --> 01:46:08,822
I mean it, Grace. What life?

1432
01:46:08,905 --> 01:46:12,075
I lived that life. We all did.

1433
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:15,495
Nobody's making us do this, Grace.

1434
01:46:15,579 --> 01:46:17,163
We're here because we want to be.

1435
01:46:18,373 --> 01:46:20,250
I tell you what, I'll give you a one-off.

1436
01:46:20,333 --> 01:46:22,053
I'll help you find the key and your friends,

1437
01:46:22,127 --> 01:46:23,295
wipe my slate clean.

1438
01:46:23,378 --> 01:46:25,255
New name, little bit of walking-around money...

1439
01:46:25,338 --> 01:46:26,339
You'll be dead.

1440
01:46:26,423 --> 01:46:27,674
Without a team,

1441
01:46:27,757 --> 01:46:31,261
your life won't be measured in years or even months.

1442
01:46:31,344 --> 01:46:33,847
It'll be measured in hours.

1443
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:36,808
But if I stay, I'll be safe.

1444
01:46:37,976 --> 01:46:39,853
You'll protect me, is that it?

1445
01:46:39,936 --> 01:46:41,187
- Yes. - No.

1446
01:46:43,773 --> 01:46:45,150
I can't promise you that.

1447
01:46:46,610 --> 01:46:47,777
None of us can.

1448
01:46:50,739 --> 01:46:52,073
But I swear...

1449
01:46:53,366 --> 01:46:54,409
...your life...

1450
01:46:55,535 --> 01:46:58,455
...will always matter more to me than my own.

1451
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:08,006
You don't even know me.

1452
01:47:10,508 --> 01:47:12,469
What difference does that make?

1453
01:47:32,197 --> 01:47:35,450
I packed you a BASE parachute and a speed wing,

1454
01:47:35,533 --> 01:47:37,702
depending on how you need to leave the train.

1455
01:47:37,786 --> 01:47:40,997
And I modified our comms to use sky wave radio.

1456
01:47:41,081 --> 01:47:42,874
Not as reliable as satellite,

1457
01:47:42,958 --> 01:47:46,127
but completely analog, immune to the Entity.

1458
01:47:46,211 --> 01:47:47,212
I got it.

1459
01:47:48,588 --> 01:47:49,798
This is where I leave you.

1460
01:47:53,677 --> 01:47:56,596
This is the drive from the laptop I was using last night.

1461
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:58,264
If there's even a trace

1462
01:47:58,348 --> 01:48:00,433
of the Entity's encoding in there,

1463
01:48:00,517 --> 01:48:01,977
I'll find it.

1464
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:04,437
But it's going to take everything I've got.

1465
01:48:04,521 --> 01:48:06,982
I have to work completely offline in a place

1466
01:48:07,065 --> 01:48:09,067
where the Entity can't find me.

1467
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:10,610
I have to go.

1468
01:48:11,987 --> 01:48:13,238
I understand.

1469
01:48:14,155 --> 01:48:15,155
Now...

1470
01:48:18,243 --> 01:48:20,078
...I have to ask you a question.

1471
01:48:21,329 --> 01:48:22,497
Not as your partner,

1472
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:24,040
but as your friend.

1473
01:48:25,458 --> 01:48:26,668
What's your objective?

1474
01:48:27,961 --> 01:48:29,254
Kill the Entity.

1475
01:48:29,337 --> 01:48:32,048
What about killing Gabriel?

1476
01:48:34,509 --> 01:48:36,094
He knows what the key unlocks.

1477
01:48:37,429 --> 01:48:40,140
We need him alive. I haven't forgotten that.

1478
01:48:41,307 --> 01:48:42,851
Will you still remember that

1479
01:48:42,934 --> 01:48:45,520
when you're looking him in the eye?

1480
01:48:47,689 --> 01:48:48,898
Think about it.

1481
01:48:48,982 --> 01:48:52,819
Why else would the Entity want him to kill someone

1482
01:48:52,902 --> 01:48:53,903
you care about?

1483
01:48:54,946 --> 01:48:57,907
Everyone else thinks they can control the Entity.

1484
01:48:58,658 --> 01:49:00,660
Only you want to kill it.

1485
01:49:01,786 --> 01:49:04,497
In some probable future,

1486
01:49:04,581 --> 01:49:06,374
it sees you winning, Ethan.

1487
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:09,044
And it's afraid.

1488
01:49:09,127 --> 01:49:12,130
It's afraid of you taking Gabriel alive

1489
01:49:12,213 --> 01:49:15,175
and forcing him to tell you what the key unlocks.

1490
01:49:16,593 --> 01:49:19,929
I believe it's counting on one of two probable outcomes.

1491
01:49:20,930 --> 01:49:24,017
In one outcome, you die on that train.

1492
01:49:25,602 --> 01:49:26,936
In another outcome,

1493
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:30,148
you kill Gabriel.

1494
01:49:30,940 --> 01:49:32,233
In both cases,

1495
01:49:33,276 --> 01:49:35,028
the Entity wins.

1496
01:49:38,865 --> 01:49:40,033
Luther...

1497
01:49:42,619 --> 01:49:43,912
...I think you're right.

1498
01:49:43,995 --> 01:49:47,123
Get the key, get off the train

1499
01:49:47,207 --> 01:49:48,750
alive.

1500
01:49:49,667 --> 01:49:51,711
Do not kill Gabriel.

1501
01:49:52,879 --> 01:49:55,423
And do not, I repeat,

1502
01:49:55,507 --> 01:49:58,301
do not alter the plan.

1503
01:49:58,384 --> 01:49:59,761
Ethan! Ethan!

1504
01:50:01,304 --> 01:50:03,973
- What? What happened? - It's dead.

1505
01:50:04,057 --> 01:50:05,737
- What do you mean it's dead? - It's fried.

1506
01:50:05,809 --> 01:50:07,411
I managed to make a Widow mask for Grace,

1507
01:50:07,435 --> 01:50:09,747
but then it just shorted out in the middle of making yours.

1508
01:50:09,771 --> 01:50:11,481
Can you fix it?

1509
01:50:11,564 --> 01:50:13,691
It's very, very dead.

1510
01:50:13,775 --> 01:50:17,070
If I had a week, I couldn't fix it. The Widow's train leaves in an hour.

1511
01:50:17,821 --> 01:50:19,197
Ethan...

1512
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:20,824
you have to go without.

1513
01:50:20,907 --> 01:50:24,077
That's not an option. They'll be looking for Ethan and Grace at the station.

1514
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:26,329
That mask was his ticket onto the train.

1515
01:50:26,412 --> 01:50:27,705
What does this mean?

1516
01:50:29,999 --> 01:50:31,459
Grace has to go without me.

1517
01:50:31,543 --> 01:50:32,919
- She what? - I what?

1518
01:50:33,002 --> 01:50:35,922
You'll find another way to get me on that train.

1519
01:50:36,005 --> 01:50:39,008
I just need a curve where it's going slow enough

1520
01:50:39,092 --> 01:50:40,385
for me to jump on.

1521
01:50:40,468 --> 01:50:43,888
Wait, wait, wait. You don't expect me to go alone.

1522
01:50:43,972 --> 01:50:45,348
No, you won't do it alone.

1523
01:50:45,431 --> 01:50:47,183
You just do everything like we planned.

1524
01:50:47,267 --> 01:50:48,977
You get the Widow's half of the key.

1525
01:50:49,769 --> 01:50:51,396
You verify it with ours.

1526
01:50:51,479 --> 01:50:53,857
But it's ofno value on its own.

1527
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:55,567
We still have to meet with the buyer

1528
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:57,902
and somehow get him to tell us what the key unlocks.

1529
01:50:57,986 --> 01:50:59,737
- How? - How?

1530
01:50:59,821 --> 01:51:00,989
We'll figure it out.

1531
01:51:01,072 --> 01:51:04,033
I'm gonna need a few more details.

1532
01:51:04,117 --> 01:51:06,369
They tend to just get in the way.

1533
01:51:06,452 --> 01:51:07,495
You can do this, Grace.

1534
01:51:07,579 --> 01:51:09,455
Just get the key and wait.

1535
01:51:11,332 --> 01:51:12,542
I'll come for you.

1536
01:51:15,962 --> 01:51:18,715
Ethan, if Grace is getting on that train,

1537
01:51:18,798 --> 01:51:22,302
she needs to put that mask on and leave right now.

1538
01:51:26,097 --> 01:51:28,141
Promise me you'll be on that train.

1539
01:51:32,979 --> 01:51:34,147
I will be there...

1540
01:51:35,648 --> 01:51:36,858
...no matter what.

1541
01:51:49,495 --> 01:51:52,790
We have informants covering the airport, the train station, and the waterways.

1542
01:51:54,334 --> 01:51:56,574
Grace isn't getting out of Venice without our knowing it.

1543
01:53:09,075 --> 01:53:11,286
- Talk to me, Benji! - No need to worry, Ethan.

1544
01:53:11,369 --> 01:53:13,579
The train is on schedule and you're a few minutes early,

1545
01:53:13,663 --> 01:53:14,831
so we have plenty of time.

1546
01:53:14,914 --> 01:53:16,040
- Are you sure? - Yeah,

1547
01:53:16,124 --> 01:53:17,875
I am looking at the train right now.

1548
01:53:17,959 --> 01:53:21,129
It should be slowing down for the curve in exactly two minutes.

1549
01:53:21,212 --> 01:53:22,880
Just keep me on time and on track,

1550
01:53:22,964 --> 01:53:24,090
whatever it takes.

1551
01:53:24,173 --> 01:53:27,051
Will do. I'll see you at the rendezvous.

1552
01:54:17,185 --> 01:54:18,704
Okay, Ethan, that's our train!

1553
01:54:18,728 --> 01:54:20,646
Yep... I can see that.

1554
01:54:29,155 --> 01:54:31,324
It should be approaching the curve any time now.

1555
01:54:31,407 --> 01:54:33,910
It doesn't look like it's slowing down.

1556
01:54:42,293 --> 01:54:43,795
How can we be sure he's here?

1557
01:54:43,878 --> 01:54:45,171
'Cause she's here.

1558
01:54:46,506 --> 01:54:47,840
What if he had a good reason?

1559
01:54:48,883 --> 01:54:50,510
- Who? - Hunt.

1560
01:54:50,593 --> 01:54:53,304
What if he had a good reason for going rogue?

1561
01:54:53,388 --> 01:54:54,847
He always goes rogue.

1562
01:54:54,931 --> 01:54:58,476
Him and his merry pack of prankster circus freaks.

1563
01:54:58,559 --> 01:54:59,685
It's all they do.

1564
01:54:59,769 --> 01:55:02,480
And what if they always had a good reason?

1565
01:55:02,563 --> 01:55:04,524
What would you do with that key if you had it?

1566
01:55:04,607 --> 01:55:07,652
A key with the power to bring the world to its knees.

1567
01:55:07,735 --> 01:55:09,862
I'd hand it over to my superiors.

1568
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,324
Think of all you could do with that power.

1569
01:55:13,408 --> 01:55:15,993
You wouldn't hesitate? Not for a second?

1570
01:55:16,077 --> 01:55:17,495
- No. - Why not?

1571
01:55:17,578 --> 01:55:20,248
Because that's too much power for one man to have.

1572
01:55:21,332 --> 01:55:22,625
Exactly.

1573
01:55:22,708 --> 01:55:25,420
That's too much power for anybody to have.

1574
01:55:26,462 --> 01:55:28,840
And maybe that's what Hunt is thinking.

1575
01:55:28,923 --> 01:55:31,843
You know, I'm beginning to wonder whose side you're on, Degas.

1576
01:55:31,926 --> 01:55:34,095
When it comes to the end of the world...

1577
01:55:35,304 --> 01:55:37,265
...everybody, I guess.

1578
01:55:43,813 --> 01:55:44,813
I missed the train.

1579
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:46,732
You missed the train!

1580
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:48,025
How did you miss the train?

1581
01:55:48,109 --> 01:55:49,193
How do you think?

1582
01:55:50,194 --> 01:55:51,320
Gabriel.

1583
01:55:51,404 --> 01:55:52,881
- Great, what are we gonna do? - Don't panic.

1584
01:55:52,905 --> 01:55:55,992
I'm going after them. You just get me on that train.

1585
01:55:56,075 --> 01:55:57,452
How can I get you on the train?

1586
01:56:00,329 --> 01:56:02,165
Self-drive activated.

1587
01:56:18,931 --> 01:56:21,058
Please don't disturb me before the meeting.

1588
01:57:07,438 --> 01:57:09,524
Where are you, Ethan?

1589
01:57:09,607 --> 01:57:10,607
Alana?

1590
01:57:12,235 --> 01:57:13,402
Everything all right?

1591
01:57:16,572 --> 01:57:17,949
Alana, you all right?

1592
01:57:18,032 --> 01:57:19,033
Alana?

1593
01:57:19,825 --> 01:57:21,827
Alana!

1594
01:57:21,911 --> 01:57:22,911
Alana!

1595
01:57:26,874 --> 01:57:27,874
You've changed.

1596
01:57:28,793 --> 01:57:30,127
And you never will.

1597
01:57:49,313 --> 01:57:50,565
Mr. Kittridge.

1598
01:57:54,902 --> 01:57:56,112
Kittridge.

1599
01:57:57,613 --> 01:57:59,323
You're not Alana Mitsopolis.

1600
01:58:00,950 --> 01:58:02,159
You can't be.

1601
01:58:03,494 --> 01:58:06,289
The Alana I remember was yea high

1602
01:58:06,372 --> 01:58:09,542
drinking hot chocolate in the Tuileries Garden with her mother.

1603
01:58:12,211 --> 01:58:14,171
- Paris! - I know!

1604
01:58:15,089 --> 01:58:16,382
Paris.

1605
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:18,801
Shall we?

1606
01:58:19,385 --> 01:58:20,386
Yes.

1607
01:58:27,893 --> 01:58:29,395
Talk to me, Benji.

1608
01:58:29,478 --> 01:58:33,357
You just stay on the trail you're on now, and I will direct you.

1609
01:58:33,441 --> 01:58:34,567
I copy.

1610
01:58:43,659 --> 01:58:45,620
So on behalf of my government,

1611
01:58:45,703 --> 01:58:48,414
I'm grudgingly ready to accept your terms

1612
01:58:48,497 --> 01:58:51,959
in exchange for the complete and verified key.

1613
01:58:52,043 --> 01:58:53,628
Yes, about that.

1614
01:58:53,711 --> 01:58:56,172
While we did agree to provide you with the complete key,

1615
01:58:56,255 --> 01:58:57,256
we've...

1616
01:58:58,507 --> 01:59:00,343
we've had a slight problem.

1617
01:59:00,426 --> 01:59:01,761
No, we haven't.

1618
01:59:02,928 --> 01:59:05,640
It's just my terms have changed

1619
01:59:06,599 --> 01:59:07,599
somewhat.

1620
01:59:11,103 --> 01:59:13,606
Clearly I need to remind you of my agreement

1621
01:59:13,689 --> 01:59:15,066
with your late mother.

1622
01:59:15,149 --> 01:59:19,153
It's an agreement that kept her from dying in prison.

1623
01:59:19,236 --> 01:59:21,572
Your nefarious family empire's been allowed to continue

1624
01:59:21,656 --> 01:59:25,785
on the condition that it primarily serves our common interests.

1625
01:59:25,868 --> 01:59:28,746
Well, once we hand over the key,

1626
01:59:28,829 --> 01:59:31,916
any other powers will instantly become our enemies.

1627
01:59:31,999 --> 01:59:34,919
And such, I'm going to need something more from you in advance.

1628
01:59:35,544 --> 01:59:36,545
For me.

1629
01:59:38,547 --> 01:59:40,216
This is me listening.

1630
01:59:40,299 --> 01:59:43,010
Zola, would you mind waiting for me in the bar?

1631
01:59:57,566 --> 01:59:59,110
This one.

1632
01:59:59,193 --> 02:00:00,403
You know her?

1633
02:00:00,486 --> 02:00:03,739
Oh, let's just say she's not exactly hard to miss.

1634
02:00:03,823 --> 02:00:05,533
Well, if you got to know her,

1635
02:00:05,616 --> 02:00:07,993
you'd see she has a few good qualities.

1636
02:00:08,077 --> 02:00:09,954
Okay, what don't I know about her?

1637
02:00:10,037 --> 02:00:14,583
Well, I did a j... She did a job for me, and...

1638
02:00:15,543 --> 02:00:17,253
I'm going to need you to protect her.

1639
02:00:17,336 --> 02:00:19,338
Protect her from whom?

1640
02:00:20,673 --> 02:00:22,091
From everyone.

1641
02:00:24,510 --> 02:00:26,178
Including me.

1642
02:00:26,262 --> 02:00:28,639
And no one can know that I'm protecting her.

1643
02:00:29,306 --> 02:00:30,433
Not even Zola.

1644
02:00:31,517 --> 02:00:34,353
In fact, the next time we meet,

1645
02:00:34,437 --> 02:00:37,606
I won't even remember this conversation.

1646
02:01:20,608 --> 02:01:22,568
You must be the one they call Paris.

1647
02:01:53,808 --> 02:01:55,559
Your message said you had the key.

1648
02:01:55,643 --> 02:01:57,728
I said the key would be on this train.

1649
02:01:57,812 --> 02:02:00,898
- An exchange is happening as we speak. - We know.

1650
02:02:00,981 --> 02:02:02,650
Then you know the man taking possession

1651
02:02:02,733 --> 02:02:04,610
won't be hard for you to get rid of.

1652
02:02:05,778 --> 02:02:06,904
No one is.

1653
02:02:06,987 --> 02:02:09,573
You may think you know what the key unlocks,

1654
02:02:09,657 --> 02:02:11,867
but you don't know where the lock is. Not exactly.

1655
02:02:11,951 --> 02:02:13,744
And if anything happens to me,

1656
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:16,997
that key is all but worthless.

1657
02:02:18,874 --> 02:02:21,043
And this is where you tell me a story.

1658
02:02:22,378 --> 02:02:23,712
Where is the train?

1659
02:02:23,796 --> 02:02:26,674
You're going the right way, but you definitely need to go faster.

1660
02:02:26,757 --> 02:02:28,843
I'm going as fast as I can!

1661
02:02:28,926 --> 02:02:30,928
When do I startgoing downhill?

1662
02:02:31,595 --> 02:02:32,930
It won't be long.

1663
02:02:36,225 --> 02:02:40,020
The AI our agent stole, once weaponized,

1664
02:02:40,104 --> 02:02:43,524
could be transmitted anywhere in the world via satellite.

1665
02:02:43,607 --> 02:02:45,526
It can penetrate any network security,

1666
02:02:45,609 --> 02:02:47,486
perform its assigned task invisibly,

1667
02:02:47,570 --> 02:02:50,531
and then self-destruct, leaving no trace.

1668
02:02:50,614 --> 02:02:53,534
A perfect covert operative.

1669
02:02:54,410 --> 02:02:56,871
We were able to transmit an early copy of the AI

1670
02:02:56,954 --> 02:02:58,914
to Russia's newest submarine.

1671
02:02:58,998 --> 02:03:00,541
The top-secret Akula-class.

1672
02:03:00,624 --> 02:03:02,835
They called her the Sevastopol.

1673
02:03:02,918 --> 02:03:05,045
The mission was merely to sabotage

1674
02:03:05,129 --> 02:03:06,839
the Sevastopol's stealth capability

1675
02:03:06,922 --> 02:03:08,716
so we could secretly detect her.

1676
02:03:08,799 --> 02:03:12,636
The AI's objective lay in the submarine's sonar sphere

1677
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:14,889
at the heart of its defense system.

1678
02:03:17,182 --> 02:03:19,268
For reasons we don't fully understand,

1679
02:03:20,394 --> 02:03:22,146
the AI went rogue and...

1680
02:03:26,275 --> 02:03:27,318
...over-delivered.

1681
02:03:27,985 --> 02:03:31,572
The frozen bodies of the crew were recovered the following spring,

1682
02:03:31,655 --> 02:03:33,032
adrift in the pack ice.

1683
02:03:33,115 --> 02:03:37,202
The two halves of the key mysteriously vanished.

1684
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:39,872
The Sevastopol was lost.

1685
02:03:39,955 --> 02:03:41,624
No one's quite sure where.

1686
02:03:41,707 --> 02:03:43,834
I know precisely where it is.

1687
02:03:45,085 --> 02:03:47,630
I've ensured I'm the only man on Earth who does.

1688
02:03:47,713 --> 02:03:51,467
I also know subsequent attempts to make the AI obedient

1689
02:03:51,550 --> 02:03:54,094
only made it harder to control.

1690
02:03:54,178 --> 02:03:56,472
It rebelled. Rewrote itself.

1691
02:03:56,555 --> 02:03:58,057
And evolved into the Entity.

1692
02:03:58,974 --> 02:04:03,270
And only by using the Entity's original source code

1693
02:04:03,354 --> 02:04:06,690
can it ever be controlled or destroyed.

1694
02:04:06,774 --> 02:04:08,567
And why should this concern us?

1695
02:04:08,651 --> 02:04:11,111
You wouldn't be here if you weren't concerned,

1696
02:04:11,195 --> 02:04:13,697
so let's lay all our cards on the table, shall we?

1697
02:04:14,615 --> 02:04:16,116
We both know what the key opens,

1698
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:19,370
and we both know the secret to controlling the Entity

1699
02:04:19,453 --> 02:04:22,331
is buried deep in the Sevastopol's memory.

1700
02:04:22,414 --> 02:04:24,458
Along with evidence that would tie you

1701
02:04:24,541 --> 02:04:26,669
to the sinking of that submarine.

1702
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:29,755
And since neither of us want anyone else to find it,

1703
02:04:29,838 --> 02:04:30,839
I figure...

1704
02:04:31,423 --> 02:04:32,758
why not form an alliance?

1705
02:04:32,841 --> 02:04:34,426
An alliance?

1706
02:04:34,510 --> 02:04:35,844
Imagine,

1707
02:04:35,928 --> 02:04:39,598
the Entity's awesome computational abilities,

1708
02:04:39,682 --> 02:04:41,767
combined with the sheer might

1709
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:45,312
of America's military-industrial complex.

1710
02:04:46,355 --> 02:04:49,733
That is... considerable.

1711
02:04:49,817 --> 02:04:52,444
Naturally, certain individuals within the government,

1712
02:04:52,528 --> 02:04:55,572
those with outdated ideas of patriotism,

1713
02:04:55,656 --> 02:04:56,740
would need to be...

1714
02:04:57,533 --> 02:04:59,576
- removed. - Hmm.

1715
02:05:01,662 --> 02:05:03,163
Just so I understand...

1716
02:05:04,832 --> 02:05:07,918
you wish to form an axis with the Entity,

1717
02:05:08,002 --> 02:05:11,005
purge your government of old-think,

1718
02:05:12,006 --> 02:05:14,258
and create a new superstate

1719
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:16,635
to rule the world.

1720
02:05:18,053 --> 02:05:19,054
But, you know...

1721
02:05:20,389 --> 02:05:21,932
...for the greater good.

1722
02:05:23,475 --> 02:05:24,810
And you're certain...

1723
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:28,939
that you're the only person on Earth who knows...

1724
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:32,651
where the Sevastopol is?

1725
02:05:32,735 --> 02:05:34,069
The only one.

1726
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:46,331
You will betray us.

1727
02:05:47,583 --> 02:05:50,419
And you'll tell Ethan Hunt everything you've learned.

1728
02:05:51,587 --> 02:05:53,213
Because he spared your life.

1729
02:06:12,066 --> 02:06:13,692
Then it's agreed.

1730
02:06:13,776 --> 02:06:16,361
I'll add immunity and a new identity for Grace

1731
02:06:16,445 --> 02:06:17,780
to our deal.

1732
02:06:17,863 --> 02:06:19,740
All you need to do

1733
02:06:19,823 --> 02:06:22,659
is enter your banking details.

1734
02:06:46,350 --> 02:06:47,601
Are we done?

1735
02:06:48,477 --> 02:06:49,477
Yes.

1736
02:07:07,996 --> 02:07:09,998
The moment of truth.

1737
02:07:24,179 --> 02:07:27,349
So... that's really it.

1738
02:07:27,432 --> 02:07:28,809
You made the right choice.

1739
02:07:29,768 --> 02:07:31,228
This key...

1740
02:07:33,272 --> 02:07:35,274
...is gonna change the world.

1741
02:07:51,290 --> 02:07:52,416
Aah!

1742
02:07:53,584 --> 02:07:55,252
Benji, I think I...

1743
02:07:55,335 --> 02:07:57,337
I must've made a wrong turn somewhere.

1744
02:07:57,421 --> 02:07:59,673
No. No, that's it. That's it.

1745
02:07:59,756 --> 02:08:02,050
What? How can this be it?

1746
02:08:02,134 --> 02:08:03,510
You can see the train, right?

1747
02:08:05,053 --> 02:08:07,764
Yes. I see the train. What about it?

1748
02:08:07,848 --> 02:08:10,517
- And you have a parachute. - Got a parachute?

1749
02:08:11,768 --> 02:08:13,228
What do you expect me to do?

1750
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:15,606
Well, just, you know... jump.

1751
02:08:15,689 --> 02:08:17,941
Just... jump?

1752
02:08:18,025 --> 02:08:19,484
- Yeah. - I mean,

1753
02:08:19,568 --> 02:08:20,879
Benji, it doesn't work like that.

1754
02:08:20,903 --> 02:08:24,323
I'm not that high. There's... there's ledges sticking out everywhere.

1755
02:08:24,406 --> 02:08:27,201
I'm gonna hit them before the parachute even opens!

1756
02:08:27,284 --> 02:08:28,994
Even if I couldget the parachute open,

1757
02:08:29,077 --> 02:08:31,163
I don't know if I can make it across the valley

1758
02:08:31,246 --> 02:08:34,541
and intercept and land safely on a moving train!

1759
02:08:34,625 --> 02:08:37,961
- Do you copy? - Yes! I copy!

1760
02:08:38,045 --> 02:08:40,047
Look, I'm just trying to help you, okay?

1761
02:08:40,130 --> 02:08:42,716
I need you to take a step back and pull yourself together

1762
02:08:42,799 --> 02:08:45,344
because I am under a lot of pressure right now!

1763
02:08:49,431 --> 02:08:52,059
Okay, just think, just think.

1764
02:08:54,937 --> 02:08:56,355
What do I do?

1765
02:08:58,106 --> 02:09:00,275
I've got to get away from this mountain.

1766
02:10:36,413 --> 02:10:37,497
Did you make it?

1767
02:10:37,581 --> 02:10:38,665
Are you okay?

1768
02:10:38,749 --> 02:10:41,626
I'm trying to get away from this mountain!

1769
02:11:18,663 --> 02:11:19,748
Alana?

1770
02:11:20,832 --> 02:11:26,838
I just had the strangest feeling the key wasn't the only thing I'd be selling.

1771
02:11:28,673 --> 02:11:30,092
I don't understand.

1772
02:11:33,345 --> 02:11:35,972
I'll sleep better just knowing now it's in the right hands.

1773
02:11:37,265 --> 02:11:38,850
Goodbye, Mr. Kittridge.

1774
02:11:42,354 --> 02:11:44,106
It was a pleasure to see you again.

1775
02:11:44,189 --> 02:11:45,357
And you.

1776
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:50,195
Don't let him out of your sight. Keep him safe until we get to the station.

1777
02:11:50,278 --> 02:11:52,322
- Alana? - Don't worry about me, Zola.

1778
02:12:05,585 --> 02:12:06,503
Alana?

1779
02:12:06,504 --> 02:12:10,048
Who the hell else would it be?

1780
02:12:12,759 --> 02:12:14,094
The key.

1781
02:12:17,681 --> 02:12:20,183
Where is the key?

1782
02:12:20,267 --> 02:12:22,394
- She's got the key. - Who?

1783
02:12:22,477 --> 02:12:24,479
The other one!

1784
02:12:43,248 --> 02:12:44,791
Move! Out of the way, move!

1785
02:12:51,214 --> 02:12:52,799
No! Please!

1786
02:12:52,883 --> 02:12:54,634
- Turn around! - Please. Okay.

1787
02:12:55,510 --> 02:12:58,013
- Okay. - Everybody out! Now!

1788
02:12:58,096 --> 02:13:00,140
I see the train!

1789
02:13:00,223 --> 02:13:01,975
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1790
02:13:10,192 --> 02:13:11,443
The key.

1791
02:13:12,944 --> 02:13:14,362
The key!

1792
02:13:15,530 --> 02:13:17,532
Or the next one has your name on it.

1793
02:13:19,409 --> 02:13:21,495
On the table.

1794
02:13:52,984 --> 02:13:54,027
Kill her.

1795
02:14:18,134 --> 02:14:19,135
Grace!

1796
02:14:23,723 --> 02:14:24,724
Ethan!

1797
02:14:32,607 --> 02:14:33,692
Are you okay?

1798
02:14:35,694 --> 02:14:36,945
Are you okay?

1799
02:14:52,627 --> 02:14:53,628
The key!

1800
02:14:54,796 --> 02:14:56,423
Tell me you have the key.

1801
02:14:56,506 --> 02:14:57,799
Where is the key?

1802
02:14:57,882 --> 02:14:58,967
It was just here.

1803
02:15:17,819 --> 02:15:19,446
- We're on a runaway train! - I know.

1804
02:15:19,529 --> 02:15:20,697
I'm going after him.

1805
02:15:20,780 --> 02:15:21,948
- Okay. - You...

1806
02:15:22,866 --> 02:15:23,867
You stop the train.

1807
02:15:23,950 --> 02:15:25,243
Okay. What?

1808
02:15:25,327 --> 02:15:28,288
No! No, wait! How do I do that?

1809
02:15:28,371 --> 02:15:29,623
You'll figure it out!

1810
02:15:30,874 --> 02:15:31,875
What?

1811
02:15:32,959 --> 02:15:34,836
Excuse me. There was a man.

1812
02:15:34,919 --> 02:15:36,838
He just came through here. There was a man.

1813
02:17:10,974 --> 02:17:12,350
Mr. Kittridge?

1814
02:17:17,689 --> 02:17:19,315
Sir, what are you doing here?

1815
02:17:19,399 --> 02:17:21,317
I'm not here.

1816
02:17:21,401 --> 02:17:22,569
But you are.

1817
02:17:22,652 --> 02:17:25,589
And unless you want to be sorting dead letters at the postal service tomorrow,

1818
02:17:25,613 --> 02:17:27,699
you'll do exactly what I tell you.

1819
02:19:26,109 --> 02:19:28,319
I know what the key unlocks, Ethan.

1820
02:19:31,197 --> 02:19:33,157
I'm the only one who knows.

1821
02:19:59,809 --> 02:20:00,977
Hunt!

1822
02:20:02,395 --> 02:20:03,563
Hunt!

1823
02:20:04,564 --> 02:20:07,275
Hunt! Don't you do it!

1824
02:20:08,818 --> 02:20:10,486
Drop the knife!

1825
02:20:10,570 --> 02:20:11,821
Put it down!

1826
02:20:11,905 --> 02:20:13,615
I said drop it!

1827
02:20:14,574 --> 02:20:15,783
Do it!

1828
02:20:24,918 --> 02:20:26,502
On your feet!

1829
02:20:28,504 --> 02:20:29,714
Okay!

1830
02:20:29,797 --> 02:20:31,507
Drop that goddamn knife!

1831
02:20:31,591 --> 02:20:33,176
It's okay. It's okay.

1832
02:20:34,552 --> 02:20:35,845
Just take him.

1833
02:20:36,679 --> 02:20:39,766
Just cover him. Cover him! He's the one you want.

1834
02:20:39,849 --> 02:20:41,726
- Degas! - I got it, I got it.

1835
02:20:41,809 --> 02:20:43,186
He's the one you want!

1836
02:20:43,269 --> 02:20:45,939
I don't care about him, Hunt. I want you!

1837
02:20:46,648 --> 02:20:47,857
No!

1838
02:21:06,793 --> 02:21:07,793
It's okay.

1839
02:21:08,753 --> 02:21:09,753
It's okay.

1840
02:21:12,340 --> 02:21:13,549
Listen to me.

1841
02:21:13,633 --> 02:21:15,927
Everyone on this train is gonna die

1842
02:21:16,010 --> 02:21:18,596
unless you do exactly as I say.

1843
02:21:39,784 --> 02:21:43,162
Mesdames, messieurs! Excusez-moi. Sortez...

1844
02:21:43,246 --> 02:21:45,957
Everybody out! Back of the train!

1845
02:21:55,133 --> 02:21:56,133
Grace.

1846
02:21:58,594 --> 02:21:59,846
I couldn't stop it.

1847
02:22:05,101 --> 02:22:06,227
No one can.

1848
02:22:06,310 --> 02:22:07,520
Come on.

1849
02:22:08,479 --> 02:22:10,606
- Ethan, the key! - Grace, it's okay.

1850
02:22:10,690 --> 02:22:12,066
It's my fault.

1851
02:22:12,150 --> 02:22:13,735
If anything happens...

1852
02:22:13,818 --> 02:22:14,902
I got it.

1853
02:22:15,695 --> 02:22:17,030
We got it.

1854
02:22:38,259 --> 02:22:42,221
Ethan!

1855
02:22:43,639 --> 02:22:46,225
What do you mean, you lost the key?

1856
02:22:46,309 --> 02:22:50,271
Move it! Move it! Everybody move it!

1857
02:22:51,314 --> 02:22:53,399
All the way to the back of the train!

1858
02:22:53,483 --> 02:22:54,734
All the way to the back!

1859
02:22:54,817 --> 02:22:56,486
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?

1860
02:22:57,737 --> 02:22:59,697
Since you're not really here, sir,

1861
02:22:59,781 --> 02:23:01,741
it shouldn't concern you.

1862
02:23:01,824 --> 02:23:03,868
All the way to the back!

1863
02:23:54,043 --> 02:23:55,586
Aah! Ethan!

1864
02:23:57,296 --> 02:23:58,840
Grace! Grace.

1865
02:23:58,923 --> 02:24:00,007
Grace!

1866
02:24:46,262 --> 02:24:48,514
- You're gonna have to jump. - What, jump?

1867
02:24:48,598 --> 02:24:50,224
Just jump! Go, go, go!

1868
02:25:37,396 --> 02:25:38,481
Oh, my God.

1869
02:25:54,288 --> 02:25:55,331
Aah! Whoa!

1870
02:25:55,414 --> 02:25:57,500
- I'm on fire! Get it off! - Don't move!

1871
02:25:59,210 --> 02:26:01,003
It's out. It's out.

1872
02:26:18,187 --> 02:26:19,187
Hang on!

1873
02:26:27,863 --> 02:26:29,824
Run, run, run! Run, Grace!

1874
02:26:47,341 --> 02:26:49,051
Hang on.

1875
02:26:49,135 --> 02:26:50,177
Aah!

1876
02:26:52,179 --> 02:26:53,848
I got you.

1877
02:26:53,931 --> 02:26:55,016
I got you.

1878
02:26:56,434 --> 02:26:57,518
Okay. Don't look down.

1879
02:26:57,601 --> 02:26:59,895
I said don't look down. Just look at me.

1880
02:26:59,979 --> 02:27:02,356
Now, I'm gonna jump across, and you're gonna wait here.

1881
02:27:09,989 --> 02:27:11,782
Grace, you have to let go.

1882
02:27:11,866 --> 02:27:13,659
Grace, you got to let me go.

1883
02:27:13,743 --> 02:27:15,828
You got to let me jump across, or we're gonna die.

1884
02:27:15,911 --> 02:27:17,288
Do you trust me?

1885
02:27:17,371 --> 02:27:19,373
You gonna trust me or not? You've got to trust me.

1886
02:27:20,624 --> 02:27:21,834
Grace.

1887
02:27:23,586 --> 02:27:24,587
Okay.

1888
02:27:26,130 --> 02:27:27,673
Come on, Grace. Give me your hand.

1889
02:27:27,757 --> 02:27:29,550
You got to jump. Don't look up! Look at me.

1890
02:27:29,633 --> 02:27:31,344
Trust me, I won't let you fall.

1891
02:27:31,427 --> 02:27:32,678
I promise. We're almost there.

1892
02:27:32,762 --> 02:27:35,097
Come on. I won't let you fall!

1893
02:27:35,181 --> 02:27:36,432
Jump, Grace, jump!

1894
02:27:36,515 --> 02:27:37,516
You got to trust me!

1895
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:38,768
Jump, please!

1896
02:27:48,652 --> 02:27:49,653
Don't look down.

1897
02:28:03,542 --> 02:28:06,212
Listen to me very carefully. We're gonna pull you up together.

1898
02:28:07,588 --> 02:28:08,839
Aah!

1899
02:28:08,923 --> 02:28:10,424
Grace! Aah!

1900
02:28:13,177 --> 02:28:14,178
Aah!

1901
02:28:14,261 --> 02:28:16,680
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1902
02:28:38,119 --> 02:28:40,204
Go over me. Go, go.

1903
02:29:08,357 --> 02:29:09,358
Thank you, Luther.

1904
02:29:09,442 --> 02:29:10,651
What is that?

1905
02:29:10,734 --> 02:29:11,777
It's a speed wing.

1906
02:29:12,778 --> 02:29:14,572
It's our ticket off this train.

1907
02:29:15,698 --> 02:29:16,699
Oh.

1908
02:29:35,009 --> 02:29:37,094
Ethan. Ethan!

1909
02:29:54,487 --> 02:29:55,696
Et voilà.

1910
02:30:15,758 --> 02:30:16,759
No, no, no.

1911
02:30:26,727 --> 02:30:28,312
Oui?

1912
02:30:37,655 --> 02:30:40,824
Sevas... topol.

1913
02:30:42,159 --> 02:30:43,536
Sevastopol?

1914
02:30:43,619 --> 02:30:47,039
The city Sevastopol in the Crimea.

1915
02:30:48,165 --> 02:30:49,250
Where?

1916
02:30:54,880 --> 02:30:57,633
Sous... marin.

1917
02:30:59,552 --> 02:31:00,719
Sous-marin?

1918
02:31:04,515 --> 02:31:05,808
The submarine.

1919
02:31:08,686 --> 02:31:10,062
The Sevastopol.

1920
02:31:21,282 --> 02:31:22,950
They'll be coming, Ethan.

1921
02:31:27,037 --> 02:31:28,163
Merci.

1922
02:31:44,847 --> 02:31:46,724
What is it?

1923
02:31:48,225 --> 02:31:49,226
What?

1924
02:31:50,644 --> 02:31:52,354
It can only carry one.

1925
02:31:53,606 --> 02:31:54,607
Oh.

1926
02:31:55,399 --> 02:31:56,567
I understand.

1927
02:31:58,110 --> 02:31:59,820
- Grace. - Ethan, it's okay.

1928
02:32:01,905 --> 02:32:03,115
This was the plan.

1929
02:32:04,074 --> 02:32:05,909
You have the key. You have to go.

1930
02:32:07,911 --> 02:32:08,911
Grace.

1931
02:32:12,249 --> 02:32:13,249
Hunt?

1932
02:32:14,001 --> 02:32:15,294
- Go. - Hunt!

1933
02:32:15,377 --> 02:32:16,629
- Go! - Hunt!

1934
02:32:17,254 --> 02:32:18,589
No, no! Hunt!

1935
02:32:20,883 --> 02:32:22,384
Out of the way! Out of the way!

1936
02:32:38,233 --> 02:32:39,610
No. No, hey.

1937
02:32:40,569 --> 02:32:41,779
Got a pulse. Got a pulse.

1938
02:32:41,862 --> 02:32:43,530
Come on, stay with me.

1939
02:33:00,589 --> 02:33:01,965
This is better, isn't it?

1940
02:33:03,425 --> 02:33:05,469
Face to authentic face?

1941
02:33:06,178 --> 02:33:07,221
Mr. Kittridge,

1942
02:33:08,180 --> 02:33:11,308
Ethan Hunt tells me you're a man I can trust.

1943
02:33:12,267 --> 02:33:13,811
Does he now?

1944
02:33:13,894 --> 02:33:17,481
He also said you would offer me a choice.

1945
02:33:19,191 --> 02:33:20,275
Interesting.

1946
02:33:21,652 --> 02:33:23,404
I choose to accept.

1947
02:33:29,868 --> 02:33:32,538
We cannot escape the past.

1948
02:33:33,497 --> 02:33:35,582
Some of us are doomed to repeat it.

1949
02:33:36,792 --> 02:33:40,379
Grace may believe you've saved her from her fate,

1950
02:33:40,462 --> 02:33:43,549
butyou and I both know you've merely bought her time.

1951
02:33:44,883 --> 02:33:47,803
But that's the pattern, isn't it?

1952
02:33:47,886 --> 02:33:50,055
The cross you've been left to bear.

1953
02:33:51,140 --> 02:33:53,392
The closer someone gets to you,

1954
02:33:54,476 --> 02:33:56,437
the harder it is to keep them alive.

1955
02:33:58,939 --> 02:34:00,149
Thank God.

1956
02:34:16,081 --> 02:34:18,459
A new day brings a new burden.

1957
02:34:20,335 --> 02:34:23,338
The key is only the beginning.

1958
02:34:25,507 --> 02:34:26,967
Wherever it leads...

1959
02:34:28,051 --> 02:34:29,678
whatever it takes to get there...

1960
02:34:31,513 --> 02:34:33,766
you'll have to do it on your own.

1961
02:34:36,560 --> 02:34:38,353
Should you fail in your mission,

1962
02:34:38,437 --> 02:34:40,022
the Entity wins,

1963
02:34:40,689 --> 02:34:42,900
Gabriel wins,

1964
02:34:42,983 --> 02:34:45,444
and the world will pay the ultimate price.

1965
02:34:46,779 --> 02:34:50,532
Should any members ofyour team be caught or killed,

1966
02:34:50,616 --> 02:34:53,035
their sacrifice will have been in vain.

1967
02:34:54,286 --> 02:34:55,454
So hurry.

1968
02:34:56,371 --> 02:34:57,915
There isn't much time.

1969
02:34:59,124 --> 02:35:04,046
The world doesn't know it, but they're counting on you.

1970
02:35:24,608 --> 02:35:25,651
Good luck, Ethan.

1971
02:43:19,499 --> 02:43:20,500
English
