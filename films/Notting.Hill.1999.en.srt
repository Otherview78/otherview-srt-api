1
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:25,314
So stay with us
because later this afternoon,

2
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:28,325
we're lucky enough
to be talking to Anna Scott,

3
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,319
Hollywood's biggest star by far.

4
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:32,701
Miss Scott's latest film
is once again topping the charts.

5
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:28,367
Of course l've seen her films...

6
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:30,827
and always thought
she was, well, fabulous.

7
00:02:30,915 --> 00:02:33,833
But, you know, a million, million miles
from the world l live in...

8
00:02:33,918 --> 00:02:38,581
which is here, Notting Hill,
my favourite bit of London.

9
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:42,754
There's the market on weekdays selling
every fruit and vegetable known to man.

10
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:45,965
Rock-hard bananas,
five for a pound !

11
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:48,808
The tattoo parlour
with a guy outside who got drunk...

12
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:52,345
and now can't remember
why he chose "I love Ken."

13
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,515
The radical hairdressers...

14
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,814
where everyone comes out
looking like the Cookie Monster,

15
00:02:56,902 --> 00:02:59,144
whether they want to or not.

16
00:02:59,238 --> 00:03:01,314
And then, suddenly,
it's the weekend,

17
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:04,076
and from break of day hundreds
of stalls appear out of nowhere,

18
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,830
filling Portobello Road,
right up to Notting Hill Gate.

19
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:10,448
And wherever you look thousands of
people are buying millions of antiques,

20
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:15,667
some genuine and some...
not quite so genuine.

21
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:19,456
And what's great is that lots of friends
have ended up in this part of London.

22
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:23,051
That's Tony, for example,
architect turned chef,

23
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:26,555
who recently invested all the money
he ever earned in a new restaurant.

24
00:03:26,642 --> 00:03:29,809
And so, this is where
l spend my days and years...

25
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:33,680
in this small village in the middle of
the city in a house with a blue door...

26
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:37,143
that my wife and l bought together
before she left me for a man...

27
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:39,907
who looked exactly like Harrison Ford.

28
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,944
And where l lead a strange half-life
with a lodger called--

29
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:44,944
Spike !

30
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,162
You couldn't help me with an incredibly
important decision, could you ?

31
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:57,252
lmportant compared to, let's say,
whether they cancel Third World debt ?

32
00:03:57,342 --> 00:04:00,462
That's right. l am at last going out
on a date with the great Janine,

33
00:04:00,553 --> 00:04:02,842
and l just wanna be sure
l've picked the right T-shirt.

34
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:05,848
- What are the choices ?
- Well, wait for it.

35
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:16,442
First there's this one.
Cool, huh ?

36
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,990
Yeah, it might make it hard
to strike a really romantic note.

37
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:22,984
Point taken.
Don't despair.

38
00:04:23,077 --> 00:04:26,778
lf it's romance we're looking for,
l believe l have just the thing.

39
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:34,917
Yeah, well, there again, she might not
think you had true love on your mind.

40
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:38,043
Right.
Just one more.

41
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,174
True love here l come.

42
00:04:51,232 --> 00:04:55,610
Well, yeah. Yeah, that's--
that's, um, perfect.

43
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,696
Great. Thanks.

44
00:04:58,782 --> 00:05:02,068
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

45
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,032
And so it was
just another hopeless Wednesday,

46
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:12,879
as l walked the thousand yards
through the market to work,

47
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:17,461
never suspecting that this was the day
that was gonna change my life forever.

48
00:05:17,553 --> 00:05:21,004
This is work, by the way,
my little travel bookshop,

49
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:25,177
- Morning, Martin.
- Morning, Monsignor.

50
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:28,270
which, um, well, sells travel books,

51
00:05:28,355 --> 00:05:31,724
and, to be frank with you,
doesn't always sell many of those.

52
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:38,940
Classic.
Profit from major sales push,

53
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:42,153
minus £347.

54
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:47,323
Shall l, uh,
go and get you a cappuccino ?

55
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:50,419
- You know, ease the pain a bit.
- Yeah, yeah.

56
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:53,589
Better make it a half.
All l can afford.

57
00:05:53,674 --> 00:05:58,502
Get your logic.
Demi-cappu coming right up.

58
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:25,078
Um, can l help you at all ?

59
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:29,787
No, thanks.
l'll just... look around.

60
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:33,716
Fine.

61
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,343
Uh, that book's really not great.

62
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:46,480
Just in case, you know, browsing turned
to buying. You'd be wasting your money.

63
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:49,020
But if it's Turkey
you're interested in,

64
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,145
um, this one, on the other hand,
is very good.

65
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:56,449
Um, l think the man who wrote it has
actually been to Turkey, which helps.

66
00:06:56,533 --> 00:07:00,401
Um, there's also
a very amusing incident with a kebab,

67
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:03,247
um, which is one
of many amusing incidents.

68
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:05,289
Thanks.
l'll think about it.

69
00:07:05,376 --> 00:07:07,867
Or, in the bigger hardback variety,
there's--

70
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:12,043
l'm sorry.
Can you just give me a second ?

71
00:07:15,178 --> 00:07:17,385
Excuse me.

72
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:19,512
- Yes ?
- Bad news.

73
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,010
What ?

74
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:24,677
We've got a security camera
in this bit of the shop.

75
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:26,017
So ?

76
00:07:26,107 --> 00:07:28,812
So l saw you put that book
down your trousers.

77
00:07:30,194 --> 00:07:34,406
- What book ?
- The one down your trousers.

78
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,064
l don't have a book
down my trousers.

79
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,117
Right.

80
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:41,493
l tell you what.
Um, l'll call the police, and, um,

81
00:07:41,582 --> 00:07:45,366
if l'm wrong about the whole
"book down the trousers" scenario,

82
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:46,871
l really apologize.

83
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:52,336
Okay. What if... l did
have a book down my trousers ?

84
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:55,261
Well, ideally,
when l went back to the desk,

85
00:07:55,346 --> 00:08:00,424
you'd remove the Cadogan Guide
to Bali from your trousers...

86
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:03,722
and either wipe it
and put it back or buy it.

87
00:08:03,813 --> 00:08:06,186
l'll see you in a sec.

88
00:08:06,274 --> 00:08:08,730
l'm sorry about that.

89
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,310
No, it's fine.

90
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:15,273
l was gonna steal one,
but now l've changed my mind.

91
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:18,285
Oh, signed by the author,
l see.

92
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:20,696
Um, yeah, couldn't stop him.

93
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,661
lf you can find an unsigned one,
it's worth an absolute fortune.

94
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:26,743
Excuse me.

95
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:28,830
- Yes ?
- Can l have your autograph ?

96
00:08:28,923 --> 00:08:31,380
Uh, sure.

97
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,178
- What's your name ?
- Rufus.

98
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,888
What does it say ?

99
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:49,023
That's my signature. And above it, it
says, "Dear Rufus, you belong in jail."

100
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,188
Good one.

101
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,484
- Do you want my phone number ?
- Tempting.

102
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,413
But... no.
Thank you.

103
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:06,165
l will take this one.

104
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,711
Oh, right, right.
So, uh--

105
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,844
Well, on second thoughts,
um, maybe it's not that bad after all.

106
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:15,799
Actually, it's a sort
of a classic, really.

107
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,474
None of those childish kebab stories
you find in so many books these days.

108
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:21,471
And, um, l tell you what.

109
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:23,521
l'll throw in
one of those for free.

110
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:26,145
Useful for, uh, lighting fires,

111
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:29,152
wrapping fish,
that sort of thing.

112
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:34,566
- Thanks.
- Pleasure.

113
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:10,065
Cappuccino, as ordered.

114
00:10:10,157 --> 00:10:12,197
Thanks.

115
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:15,369
l don't think you'll believe
who was just in here.

116
00:10:15,454 --> 00:10:18,289
Who ?
Was it someone famous ?

117
00:10:21,877 --> 00:10:23,954
Would be exciting, though,
wouldn't it,

118
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:26,372
if someone famous
came into the shop ? Hmm ?

119
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:30,416
Do you know--
and this is pretty amazing, actually--

120
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:32,754
but l once saw Ringo Starr.

121
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:35,136
- Where was that ?
- Kensington High Street.

122
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:37,134
At least l think it was Ringo.

123
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:39,933
lt might have been that man
from Fiddler on the Roof.

124
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:42,692
- You know, Toppy.
- Topol.

125
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,445
Yes, that's right.
Topol.

126
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:47,437
Mm-hmm.

127
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,398
Actually, Ringo Starr doesn't--
doesn't look at all like, uh, Topol.

128
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:54,577
Yeah, but he was--
he was quite a long way away from me.

129
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:57,748
So actually it could've
been neither of them.

130
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,668
Yes, l suppose so, yes.

131
00:11:00,753 --> 00:11:05,165
- lt's not a classic anecdote, is it ?
- Not a classic, no. No.

132
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:13,383
- Another one ?
- Yes. No.

133
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:16,926
Let's go crazy.
l'll have an orange juice.

134
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:37,289
- Oh, my God !
- Bugger ! l'm so sorry. l'm so sorry.

135
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,210
- Here. Let me--
- Get your hands off !

136
00:11:40,295 --> 00:11:43,082
l'm really sorry.
l-- l live just over the street.

137
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:46,377
l have, um, water and soap.
You can get cleaned up.

138
00:11:46,468 --> 00:11:48,675
No, thank you.
l just need to get my car back.

139
00:11:48,762 --> 00:11:52,096
l also have a phone.
l'm confident that in five minutes...

140
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:55,137
we could have you spick-and-span
and back on the street again.

141
00:11:55,227 --> 00:11:57,932
ln the non-prostitute sense,
obviously.

142
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:04,234
All right. Well-- What do you mean,
"just over the street" ?

143
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:08,069
- Give it to me in yards.
- Uh, 18 yards.

144
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:11,408
That's my house there
with the blue front door.

145
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:17,582
Come on in.
l'll just-- l'll just--

146
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:25,749
Um, right. Right.
Come in.

147
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:29,212
lt's, um, not quite as tidy
as it normally is, l fear.

148
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:32,473
But, um--
The bathroom's on the top floor.

149
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,427
And the telephone's just--
just up here.

150
00:12:37,982 --> 00:12:40,307
Here.
Let-- Let me, um--

151
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:49,567
Um, round the corner.
Straight on-- straight on up.

152
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,282
Bugger.

153
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,106
Would you like a cup of tea
before you go ?

154
00:13:20,193 --> 00:13:22,566
- No.
- Coffee ?

155
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:25,406
- No.
- Orange juice ?

156
00:13:26,534 --> 00:13:30,994
Probably not.
Um, something else cold.

157
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,207
Coke ? Water ?

158
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:39,205
Some disgusting sugary drink...

159
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:41,373
pretending to have something to do
with fruits of the forest ?

160
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:44,503
- No.
- Would you like something to eat ?

161
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:46,836
Uh, something to nibble ?

162
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,762
Um, apricots soaked in honey ?

163
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:54,268
Quite why, no one knows, because
it stops them tasting of apricots...

164
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,681
and makes them taste like honey,

165
00:13:56,774 --> 00:14:01,732
and if you wanted honey, you'd just
buy honey instead of... apricots.

166
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:04,277
Um, but nevertheless,
there we go there.

167
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:06,488
They're yours if you want them.

168
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:13,370
Do you always say "no"
to everything ?

169
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:21,419
l'd better be going.

170
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:24,759
Thanks for your, uh, help.

171
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:26,756
You're welcome.

172
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:32,187
And, uh, may l also say,
um, heavenly.

173
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,188
l'll just take
my one chance to say it.

174
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:37,515
After you've read
that terrible book,

175
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:39,934
you're certainly not going
to be coming back to the shop.

176
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:42,651
Thank you.

177
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,690
Yeah.
Well, my pleasure.

178
00:14:57,256 --> 00:15:00,008
So...

179
00:15:00,092 --> 00:15:02,132
it was nice to meet you.

180
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:06,466
Surreal but, um-- but nice.

181
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,468
Sorry.

182
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:21,438
"Surreal but nice" ?
What was l thinking ?

183
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:39,800
- l forgot my other bag.
- Oh, right. Right.

184
00:15:48,644 --> 00:15:50,553
Thanks.

185
00:16:21,137 --> 00:16:25,883
l'm very sorry about
the "surreal but nice" comment.

186
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:28,431
- Disaster.
- That's okay.

187
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,265
l thought the apricot and honey thing
was the real low point.

188
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:38,149
Oh, my God.
My flatmate.

189
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:40,908
l'm sorry.
There's no excuse for him.

190
00:16:45,496 --> 00:16:47,821
l'm just going into the kitchen
to get some food.

191
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:52,293
Then l'm gonna tell you a story
that will make your balls shrink
to the size of raisins.

192
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:00,800
Probably best
not to tell anyone about this.

193
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:03,842
Right. Right.
No one.

194
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:06,221
l mean, l'll tell myself sometimes.

195
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,932
But don't worry.
l won't believe it.

196
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:32,121
There's something wrong
with this yogurt.

197
00:17:34,006 --> 00:17:37,126
lt's not yogurt.
lt's mayonnaise.

198
00:17:37,218 --> 00:17:39,211
Oh, right.
There we are then.

199
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:44,099
On for a videofest tonight ?

200
00:17:45,477 --> 00:17:48,644
l got some absolute classics.

201
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:54,269
- Smile.
- No.

202
00:17:57,615 --> 00:18:01,862
- Smile.
- l've got nothing to smile about.

203
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,831
Okay.

204
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:15,545
ln about seven seconds,

205
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:18,304
l'm going to ask you
to marry me.

206
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:27,552
lmagine.

207
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:32,475
Somewhere in the world
there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.

208
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,735
Yes, she is, uh,

209
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:41,656
fairly fabulous.

210
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,292
- Do you have any books by Dickens ?
- No.

211
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:56,843
No, l'm afraid we're a travel bookshop.
We only sell travel books.

212
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:01,764
Oh, right. How about
the new John Grisham thriller ?

213
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:07,183
Well, no, 'cause that's, uh--
that's a novel too, isn't it ?

214
00:19:07,273 --> 00:19:10,108
Oh, right.

215
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:16,521
Have you got Winnie the Pooh ?

216
00:19:18,118 --> 00:19:20,574
Martin, your customer.

217
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:22,702
Uh, can l help you ?

218
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:44,391
Just, um, incidentally,

219
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:47,480
uh, why...
are you wearing that ?

220
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:51,267
Combination of factors really.
Uh, no clean clothes.

221
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:55,229
There never will be, you know,
unless you actually clean your clothes.

222
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:57,732
Right.
Vicious circle.

223
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:00,496
And l was, like,
rooting around in your things...

224
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,619
and l found this,
and l thought "cool."

225
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:06,914
Kinda... spacey.

226
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:12,919
There's something wrong
with the goggles, though.

227
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,880
No, they were, um, prescription.

228
00:20:15,971 --> 00:20:19,589
-Groovy.
-So l could see all the fishes properly.

229
00:20:19,683 --> 00:20:22,306
You should do more
of this stuff.

230
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:26,345
- So, look, any messages today ?
- Yeah, l wrote a couple down.

231
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:29,810
So there were two.
There were two messages ? Right ?

232
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,065
You want me to write down
all your messages ?

233
00:20:35,158 --> 00:20:39,287
Okay, who are the ones
that you didn't write down from ?

234
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:42,618
No. Gone completely.

235
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,618
Oh, no.
There was one from your mum.

236
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,332
She said don't forget lunch,
and her leg's hurting again.

237
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:49,959
- No one else ?
- Absolutely no one else.

238
00:20:53,428 --> 00:20:56,714
Though if we're going for this obsessive
writing down all the message thing,

239
00:20:56,807 --> 00:21:00,223
some American girl called Anna
called a few days ago.

240
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:08,692
- What did she say ?
- Well, it was genuinely bizarre.

241
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:14,235
She said, "Hi. It's Anna."
Then she said, "Call me at The Ritz"...

242
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:17,777
and then gave herself
a completely different name.

243
00:21:17,871 --> 00:21:21,785
- Which was ?
- Absolutely no idea.

244
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,282
Remembering one name's hard enough.

245
00:21:24,377 --> 00:21:26,620
No, l-- l know that.
She-- She said that.

246
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:28,956
Um, l know she's using another name.

247
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,501
The problem is
she left the message with my flatmate...

248
00:21:32,595 --> 00:21:34,504
which was a very serious mistake.

249
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:38,891
Um, l don't know. lmagine, if you will,
the stupidest person you've ever met.

250
00:21:38,976 --> 00:21:43,189
- Are you doing that ?
- Yes, sir, l have him in my mind.

251
00:21:43,273 --> 00:21:46,559
And now double it.
And that is the, um-- what can l say--

252
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:49,190
the git that l am living with.

253
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,655
And he can't remember--

254
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:53,824
- Try Flintstone.
- l'm sorry, what ?

255
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:57,361
l think she said
her name was Flintstone.

256
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:04,374
l don't-- l don't suppose, um,
Flintstone rings any bells, does it ?

257
00:22:04,462 --> 00:22:07,712
- Oh, l'll put you right through, sir.
- Oh, my God.

258
00:22:10,385 --> 00:22:13,506
Hello. Hi.

259
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,507
- Hi there.
- Hello ?

260
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:21,350
- Sorry. lt's William... Thacker.
- Yes ?

261
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:23,977
Um, we-- l work in a bookshop.

262
00:22:27,987 --> 00:22:31,191
Oh, no, l promise you l've never played
anything cool in my entire life.

263
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,782
My flatmate, who'll l'll stab to death
later, never gave me the message.

264
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:38,993
l don't know.
Perhaps, um,

265
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:43,412
l could drop round
for tea later or something.

266
00:22:45,924 --> 00:22:48,497
Right. Right. Great.

267
00:22:56,977 --> 00:22:58,934
Classic.

268
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:05,775
Classic.

269
00:23:43,693 --> 00:23:46,363
- Which floor ?
- Three, please.

270
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,515
Uh, are you sure this is--

271
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:20,309
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sure.

272
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:33,487
- Hi. Hi. l'm Karen.
- Hi.

273
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,118
l'm sorry.
Things are running a little bit late.

274
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:40,289
Here's the, uh, thing.
Do you wanna come this way ?

275
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:43,084
Through here.

276
00:24:47,178 --> 00:24:49,586
So what did you
think of the film ?

277
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,468
Yeah, l thought it was fantastic.
l thought it was, uh,

278
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,094
Close Encounters
meets Jean de Florette.

279
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,099
l agree.

280
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:03,110
l'm sorry. l didn't get down
what magazines you're from.

281
00:25:03,195 --> 00:25:05,651
- Time Out.
- Great.

282
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:08,740
And you're from ?

283
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:15,747
Horse & Hound.

284
00:25:20,171 --> 00:25:23,754
The name's William Thacker. l think,
actually, she might be expecting me.

285
00:25:23,842 --> 00:25:26,629
Oh, okay.
Take a seat and l'll go check.

286
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:33,593
l see you've, uh--
l see you've brought her some flowers.

287
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:40,023
These are for my,
um, grandmother.

288
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:42,861
She's in a hospital
just down the road.

289
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:45,651
Thought l'd kill two birds
with one stone, you know.

290
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:48,991
Sure, right.
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

291
00:25:49,078 --> 00:25:51,782
Which hospital's that ?

292
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,455
Do you mind me not saying ?
lt's a rather distressing disease.

293
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:57,618
Name of the hospital
kind of gives it away.

294
00:26:01,216 --> 00:26:04,003
Right, uh, Mr Thacker.
Will you come this way.

295
00:26:04,094 --> 00:26:06,466
Right.

296
00:26:06,555 --> 00:26:09,425
You've got five minutes.

297
00:26:18,192 --> 00:26:21,395
- Hi.
- Hello.

298
00:26:21,487 --> 00:26:25,402
Uh, l brought these, but clearly--

299
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:29,275
No, they're great.
They're great.

300
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,242
Ah, listen,
l'm sorry about not ringing back.

301
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,242
The whole "two-names concept"...

302
00:26:34,335 --> 00:26:36,826
was totally too much for my flatmate's
pea-sized intellect.

303
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,752
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.
l always pick a... cartoon character.

304
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:43,000
Last time l was Mrs Bambi.

305
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,134
- Everything all right ?
- Yes, thank you.

306
00:26:49,226 --> 00:26:52,013
And you're from, uh,
Horse & Hound.

307
00:26:54,773 --> 00:26:57,525
ls that so ? Well.

308
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,614
So, uh--

309
00:27:08,704 --> 00:27:13,947
Uh, l'll just... fire away then,
shall l ?

310
00:27:15,545 --> 00:27:17,584
Right.

311
00:27:21,051 --> 00:27:24,337
The film's great, and, um,

312
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,431
l just was wondering whether...

313
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:29,639
you ever thought of having, um,

314
00:27:29,727 --> 00:27:33,475
more, uh, horses in it.

315
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,144
Uh, well, we would have liked to,

316
00:27:40,238 --> 00:27:45,577
but it was, um, difficult,
obviously, being set in space.

317
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:50,910
Space, right, yeah.
Yeah, obviously very difficult.

318
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:54,202
l'm so sorry.
l arrived outside.

319
00:27:54,295 --> 00:27:56,252
They thrust this thing
into my hand--

320
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:59,624
No, it's my fault.
l thought this would all be over by now.

321
00:27:59,717 --> 00:28:02,422
l just wanted to sort of apologize
for the kissing thing.

322
00:28:02,512 --> 00:28:04,421
l seriously don't know
what came over me.

323
00:28:04,514 --> 00:28:07,515
And l just wanted to make sure
that you were fine about it.

324
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:13,931
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely fine.

325
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,028
Do remember that Miss Scott is also
keen to talk about her next project...

326
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:22,813
which is, um, shooting
later in the summer.

327
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:26,361
Ah, yes, excellent.
Excellent.

328
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:35,463
Any horses in that one ?

329
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:40,969
Or hounds for that matter. Our readers
are equally intrigued by both species.

330
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:43,841
lt takes place on a submarine.

331
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:47,383
Oh. Well, bad luck.

332
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,385
But, um,

333
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,769
if there were horses in it,

334
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:56,432
would you be riding them...

335
00:28:56,527 --> 00:29:01,155
or would you be getting, a--
a stunt-horse-double-man-thing ?

336
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:08,405
l-l'm a complete moron.
l apologize. l--

337
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:12,366
This is very weird. lt's the sort
of thing that happens in dreams,

338
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:15,036
not in real life.

339
00:29:15,132 --> 00:29:17,587
l mean, good dreams.
lt's a--

340
00:29:17,676 --> 00:29:21,259
lt's a dream, in fact,
uh, to see you again.

341
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:26,513
What happens next in the dream ?

342
00:29:28,353 --> 00:29:32,731
l suppose in the, uh, dream--

343
00:29:32,817 --> 00:29:36,352
dream scenario--
l just, uh,

344
00:29:36,446 --> 00:29:38,604
change my personality...

345
00:29:38,698 --> 00:29:41,367
because you can do that
in dreams and, um,

346
00:29:43,703 --> 00:29:47,951
walk over and, uh, kiss the girl.

347
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:50,711
But, uh--

348
00:29:58,385 --> 00:30:02,087
Time's up, l'm afraid.
Did you get what you wanted ?

349
00:30:02,182 --> 00:30:07,389
- Um, nearly, nearly.
- Well, maybe just one last question.

350
00:30:08,814 --> 00:30:11,435
- Sure.
- Right, right.

351
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,487
Are you... busy tonight ?

352
00:30:18,574 --> 00:30:23,450
- Yes.
- Right. Right.

353
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,989
- Come in.
- Well, it was nice to meet you.

354
00:30:29,085 --> 00:30:31,327
Yes, and you.

355
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:33,828
Surreal... but nice.

356
00:30:33,923 --> 00:30:38,302
Thank you. You are Horse & Hound's
favourite actress.

357
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,136
You and Black Beauty...

358
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:44,133
tied.

359
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:51,183
How was she ?

360
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:54,727
Oh, um, fabulous.

361
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:58,901
Excellent. Wait a minute.
She took your grandmother's flowers.

362
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:02,527
Uh, yeah, yeah.
That's right.

363
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:04,697
- Bitch.
- Oh, Mr Thacker.

364
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:09,203
Mr Thacker, if you'd like to come with
me, we can rush you through the others.

365
00:31:09,295 --> 00:31:10,706
The others ?

366
00:31:10,797 --> 00:31:13,370
Mr Thacker is from Horse & Hound.

367
00:31:16,344 --> 00:31:18,752
- How's it going ?
- Very well, thank you.

368
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:20,257
Have a seat.

369
00:31:22,392 --> 00:31:25,559
Well, did you enjoy the film ?

370
00:31:25,646 --> 00:31:28,730
Yes, enormously.

371
00:31:28,816 --> 00:31:30,643
- Well, fire away.
- Right.

372
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:34,520
Did you enjoy making the film ?

373
00:31:34,613 --> 00:31:38,481
- Yes, l did.
- Good.

374
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:41,032
Any bit in particular ?

375
00:31:41,121 --> 00:31:44,241
You tell me what bit
you enjoyed the most,

376
00:31:44,332 --> 00:31:47,333
and l'll tell you
if l enjoyed making that bit.

377
00:31:49,338 --> 00:31:53,086
Uh, l...

378
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:56,177
liked the bit in space...

379
00:31:56,262 --> 00:31:58,171
very much.

380
00:31:58,264 --> 00:32:01,847
Did you identify with the character
you're playing ?

381
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:15,354
Oh. Why not ?

382
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:25,454
Because he's playing
a psychopathic flesh-eating robot.

383
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,750
Classic.

384
00:32:27,838 --> 00:32:30,625
So, uh,

385
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:33,289
is this your first film ?

386
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:36,220
No. lt's my 22nd.

387
00:32:36,305 --> 00:32:40,219
Of course it is.
Any favourites among the 22 ?

388
00:32:41,685 --> 00:32:43,595
Working with Leonardo.

389
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:47,733
- Da Vinci ?
- DiCaprio.

390
00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:50,652
Of course.

391
00:32:50,737 --> 00:32:54,734
And is-- is he your favourite
ltalian director ?

392
00:32:59,287 --> 00:33:02,408
- Mr Thacker.
- Oh, no.

393
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,287
- Have you got a minute ?
- No.

394
00:33:16,973 --> 00:33:20,674
Um-- Yeah, so the, um--

395
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:25,016
the-- the thing l was doing tonight,
l'm not doing any more.

396
00:33:25,107 --> 00:33:27,562
l told them l had
to spend the evening...

397
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:31,435
with Britain's premier
equestrian journalist.

398
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:34,615
Oh. Well, great.

399
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:36,859
Fantastic.
That's, uh--

400
00:33:36,953 --> 00:33:40,203
Oh. Shittity brickitty.

401
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,824
lt's my sister's birthday. Shit.
We're meant to be having dinner.

402
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:46,789
- Okay, that's fine.
- No. l'm sure l can get out of it.

403
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,332
No, l mean, if it's fine with you,
l'll be your date.

404
00:33:51,927 --> 00:33:55,012
You--
You'll be my date...

405
00:33:55,097 --> 00:33:57,802
to my little sister's
birthday party ?

406
00:33:57,892 --> 00:34:01,640
- lf it's all right.
- Well, yeah, l'm sure it's all right.

407
00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:03,556
My friend Max is cooking,

408
00:34:03,647 --> 00:34:06,649
and he is generally acknowledged
to be the worst cook in the world.

409
00:34:06,735 --> 00:34:11,148
But, um, you know, you could hide
the food in your handbag or something.

410
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:15,486
- Okay.
- Okay.

411
00:34:17,496 --> 00:34:21,364
- He's bringing a girl ?
- Miracles do happen.

412
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:25,539
- Does the girl have a name ?
- Don't know. Wouldn't say.

413
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,335
Oh, Christ !
What is going on in there ?

414
00:34:28,424 --> 00:34:32,208
Oh, God !

415
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:37,219
Hi. Come on in.
Vague food crisis.

416
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:45,141
Hiya ! Sorry.

417
00:34:45,234 --> 00:34:48,152
The guinea fowl is proving
more complicated than expected.

418
00:34:48,237 --> 00:34:51,155
- He's cooking guinea-fowl ?
- Don't even ask.

419
00:34:54,202 --> 00:34:56,776
Good Lord,
you're the spitting image of--

420
00:34:56,872 --> 00:34:58,864
Bella, this is Anna.

421
00:35:00,626 --> 00:35:02,749
- Right.
- Okay, crisis over.

422
00:35:02,836 --> 00:35:05,754
Max, this is Anna.

423
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,256
- Hi.
- Hello, Anna--

424
00:35:09,344 --> 00:35:12,095
Scott.
Have some wine.

425
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,422
Thank you.

426
00:35:14,516 --> 00:35:16,259
l'll get it.

427
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,180
Red or white ?

428
00:35:21,272 --> 00:35:24,024
- Oh. Hey.
- Hi.

429
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:27,644
- Oh, yes, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

430
00:35:27,738 --> 00:35:29,945
Look, your brother's
brought this girl.

431
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:31,443
Hi, guys.

432
00:35:32,785 --> 00:35:34,778
Oh, holy fuck !

433
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:38,322
Hon, this is Anna. Anna, this is Honey.
She's my baby sister.

434
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:40,408
Oh. Hi.

435
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:43,373
Oh, God. This is one
of those key moments in life...

436
00:35:43,463 --> 00:35:46,381
when it's possible
you can be really genuinely cool...

437
00:35:46,466 --> 00:35:51,627
and l-- l'm going to fail
just a hundred percent.

438
00:35:53,682 --> 00:35:58,096
l-- l absolutely,
totally and utterly adore you.

439
00:35:58,188 --> 00:36:02,481
And l just think... you are
the most beautiful woman in the world.

440
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:05,734
And, more importantly,
l genuinely believe,

441
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,731
and l've believed for some time now,
that we could be best friends.

442
00:36:10,825 --> 00:36:13,780
So what do you think ?

443
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:17,788
Uh, lucky me.

444
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:22,457
Well, happy birthday.

445
00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:27,588
Oh, you gave me a present.
We're best friends already then.

446
00:36:27,677 --> 00:36:30,382
Marry Will. He's a really nice guy.
Then we can be sisters.

447
00:36:30,472 --> 00:36:32,797
Well, l'll think about it.

448
00:36:34,685 --> 00:36:37,223
That'll be Bernie.

449
00:36:38,438 --> 00:36:40,727
- Hi.
- Hi. Sorry l'm late.

450
00:36:40,816 --> 00:36:43,733
Bollocksed up at work again, l fear.

451
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:46,358
- Millions down the drain.
- Well done.

452
00:36:46,447 --> 00:36:49,567
- Bernie, this is Anna.
- Hello, Anna. Delighted to meet you.

453
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:53,526
-And you.
-Honey bunny, Happy birthday to you

454
00:36:53,621 --> 00:36:56,409
- Hi, Bella.
- Hi.

455
00:36:56,499 --> 00:37:00,118
Um, it-- it-- it's a hat.
You don't have to wear it or anything.

456
00:37:00,211 --> 00:37:03,130
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.

457
00:37:06,093 --> 00:37:08,715
- Hi.
- What ?

458
00:37:08,804 --> 00:37:10,762
- Wine, Bernie ?
- Mm.

459
00:37:10,848 --> 00:37:13,256
You haven't slept with her, have you ?

460
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:15,758
That is a cheap question, and
the answer is, or course, no comment.

461
00:37:15,853 --> 00:37:17,763
- No comment means "yes."
- No, it doesn't.

462
00:37:17,856 --> 00:37:19,765
- Do you ever masturbate ?
- Definitely no comment.

463
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:22,480
- You see, it means "yes."
- Oh, my God !

464
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:27,112
So, uh, tell me,
um, Anna, what do you do ?

465
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:30,947
- l'm an actress.
- Oh, splendid.

466
00:37:31,036 --> 00:37:33,029
What do you do ?

467
00:37:33,122 --> 00:37:36,871
l'm actually in the stock market myself,
so, uh, not really similar fields.

468
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,080
Though, um-- um, l have done
the odd bit of amateur stuff.

469
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:44,632
Um-- uh, P. G. Wodehouse.
Farce, all that, you know.

470
00:37:44,718 --> 00:37:47,339
"Careful there, Vicar."

471
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:50,680
Always imagined it's a pretty tough job,
though, acting.

472
00:37:50,766 --> 00:37:54,764
- The wages are a scandal, aren't they ?
- They can be.

473
00:37:54,854 --> 00:37:56,811
l see friends from university--
clever chaps.

474
00:37:56,897 --> 00:37:58,807
Been in the business longer than you.

475
00:37:58,899 --> 00:38:03,645
They're scraping by on seven,
eight thousand a year.

476
00:38:03,738 --> 00:38:06,026
You know, it's no life.

477
00:38:06,115 --> 00:38:10,493
- What sort of acting do you do ?
- Films, mainly.

478
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:15,455
Oh, splendid. Oh, well done.
How's the pay in movies ?

479
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:20,418
l mean, last film you did,
what did you get paid ?

480
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,748
Fifteen million dollars.

481
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,711
Right.

482
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:30,015
So that's, well, fairly good.

483
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,139
Right, l think we're ready.

484
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,138
Bella, can you tell me
where l can find--

485
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,270
Oh, sorry.
lt's down the corridor on the right.

486
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,435
l'll show you.

487
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:45,855
Quickly, quickly.
Talk very, very quickly.

488
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,528
What are you doing here
with Anna Scott ?

489
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:49,611
- Anna Scott ?
- Yes. Shut up !

490
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:51,696
- What, the film star ?
- Shh !

491
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:54,363
- Oh, God !
- What ?

492
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:57,295
- Oh, God. Oh, goddy God.
- What did you say to her ?

493
00:38:57,379 --> 00:39:00,830
l don't believe it.
l actually walked into the loo with her.

494
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:03,759
l was still chatting
when she started unbuttoning her jeans.

495
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:06,252
- She had to ask me to leave.
- Oh, God.

496
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:08,339
So you knew who she was ?

497
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,632
Of course l did, but he didn't.

498
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:14,807
Well, not instantly, but l-- l--
l got away with it.

499
00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:22,604
- What do you think of the guinea-fowl ?
- l'm a vegetarian.

500
00:39:22,697 --> 00:39:25,105
Oh, God.

501
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,988
So, how's the guinea-fowl ?

502
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,448
Best guinea-fowl
l've ever tasted.

503
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:09,246
Having you here, Anna, firmly
establishes what l've long suspected--

504
00:40:09,331 --> 00:40:12,118
that we really are the most
desperate lot of underachievers.

505
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:15,126
- Shame.
- l'm not saying it's a bad thing.

506
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:18,581
ln fact, l think it's something
we should take pride in.

507
00:40:18,674 --> 00:40:21,924
l'm gonna give the last brownie
as a prize...

508
00:40:22,011 --> 00:40:24,383
to the saddest act here.

509
00:40:24,472 --> 00:40:27,177
- Uh-oh.
- Bern.

510
00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:30,469
Yeah, all right.
Well, obviously, it's me, isn't it ?

511
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:33,647
l mean, l work in the city in a job
l don't understand,

512
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:36,140
and everyone keeps
getting promoted above me.

513
00:40:36,235 --> 00:40:38,773
l haven't had a girlfriend since--
well, since puberty.

514
00:40:38,862 --> 00:40:41,899
And... nobody fancies me.

515
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,528
And if these cheeks get any chubbier,
they never will.

516
00:40:44,618 --> 00:40:48,403
- Nonsense. l fancy you.
- Really ?

517
00:40:48,498 --> 00:40:51,071
Yeah. Or l did
before you got so fat.

518
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:54,085
You see.
And unless l'm much mistaken,

519
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:56,792
your job still pays you
rather a lot of money...

520
00:40:56,881 --> 00:40:59,289
whilst Honey here
earns 20 pence a week...

521
00:40:59,384 --> 00:41:02,171
flogging her guts out
in London's worst record store.

522
00:41:02,262 --> 00:41:05,383
Yes ! And l haven't got hair.
l've got feathers.

523
00:41:05,474 --> 00:41:09,306
And l've got funny goggly eyes.
And l'm attracted to cruel men.

524
00:41:09,395 --> 00:41:11,933
And, actually,
no one will marry me...

525
00:41:12,023 --> 00:41:15,143
because, um, my boosies
have actually started shrinking.

526
00:41:15,234 --> 00:41:17,642
- You see, it's incredibly sad.
- But on the other hand,

527
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:19,480
her best friend is Anna Scott.

528
00:41:19,572 --> 00:41:23,024
That's true. l can't deny it.
She needs me. What can l say ?

529
00:41:24,203 --> 00:41:27,785
And most of her limbs work, whereas
l'm stuck in this thing day and night,

530
00:41:27,873 --> 00:41:29,866
in a house full of ramps.

531
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:32,829
And to add insult
to serious injury,

532
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:38,164
l've totally given up smoking,
my favourite thing.

533
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:42,589
And, um, well, the truth is,

534
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:44,887
we can't have a baby.

535
00:41:50,564 --> 00:41:52,641
Oh, Belle.

536
00:41:52,733 --> 00:41:56,185
C'est la vie.

537
00:41:57,864 --> 00:42:01,731
Still, um, we're lucky in lots of ways.

538
00:42:01,826 --> 00:42:04,827
But surely that's worth a brownie.

539
00:42:06,414 --> 00:42:11,658
Well, l don't know.
Look at William.

540
00:42:11,754 --> 00:42:14,920
- Very unsuccessful professionally.
- That's true.

541
00:42:15,007 --> 00:42:19,835
Divorced. Used to be handsome,
now kind of squidgy round the edges.

542
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,842
And absolutely certain never
to hear from Anna again...

543
00:42:23,932 --> 00:42:26,970
- once she's heard that his
nickname at school was--
- Floppy.

544
00:42:27,062 --> 00:42:30,228
You did.
l can't believe it, you did.

545
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:33,684
Thanks very much. Thank you.
Well, at least l get the last brownie.

546
00:42:33,777 --> 00:42:35,686
l think so, yes.

547
00:42:35,779 --> 00:42:37,736
Well, wait.
What about me ?

548
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:43,370
l'm sorry ?
You think you deserve the brownie ?

549
00:42:43,454 --> 00:42:47,666
Well, a shot at it at least, huh ?

550
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,668
You'll have to prove it.
This is a very, very good brownie.

551
00:42:50,753 --> 00:42:53,423
l'm gonna fight for it.

552
00:42:53,506 --> 00:42:56,839
l've been on a diet
every day since l was 19,

553
00:42:56,927 --> 00:43:00,261
which basically means
l've been hungry for a decade.

554
00:43:02,516 --> 00:43:06,099
l've had a series of not-nice
boyfriends, one of whom hit me.

555
00:43:06,186 --> 00:43:09,223
Uh, and every time
l get my heart broken,

556
00:43:09,315 --> 00:43:13,645
the newspapers splash it about
as though it's entertainment.

557
00:43:15,655 --> 00:43:20,816
And... it's taken two rather painful,
um, operations...

558
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:22,868
to get me looking like this.

559
00:43:22,954 --> 00:43:26,074
- Really ?
- Really.

560
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:32,998
And one day not long from now,
my looks will go,

561
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,926
they will discover l can't act,

562
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:40,838
and l will become
some sad, middle-aged woman...

563
00:43:40,932 --> 00:43:45,760
who... looks a bit like someone
who was famous for a while.

564
00:43:53,696 --> 00:43:56,151
No, nice try, gorgeous,
but you don't fool anyone.

565
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:00,866
Pathetic effort
to hog the brownie.

566
00:44:02,872 --> 00:44:06,288
- Thank you for such a terrific time.
- l'm delighted.

567
00:44:07,752 --> 00:44:10,670
- That's a great tie.
- Now you're lying.

568
00:44:10,755 --> 00:44:13,377
Okay, it's true.
l told you l was bad at acting.

569
00:44:13,466 --> 00:44:15,874
- lt was lovely to meet you.
- Yeah, and you. And you.

570
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:18,722
l'll wait until you've gone
before l tell him you're a vegetarian.

571
00:44:23,186 --> 00:44:26,685
- Good night.
- l'm so sorry about the loo thing.

572
00:44:26,773 --> 00:44:29,264
l meant to leave.
l just--

573
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:31,766
Ring me if you want someone
to go shopping with.

574
00:44:31,861 --> 00:44:35,397
l know lots of nice, cheap places,
not that money is necessarily--

575
00:44:35,491 --> 00:44:37,400
lt was just so nice to meet you.

576
00:44:37,493 --> 00:44:40,363
- Happy birthday. You're my style guru.
- Thank you.

577
00:44:40,454 --> 00:44:42,577
- Sorry. Can l just--
- Oh.

578
00:44:42,665 --> 00:44:44,574
- Thanks.
- Leave her.

579
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,576
- Good night, everyone.
- Bye.

580
00:44:46,669 --> 00:44:49,586
Max, Belle,
we'll see you in a couple of days.

581
00:44:49,672 --> 00:44:52,164
- Thank you, everybody. Call us.
- Bye, guys.

582
00:44:52,259 --> 00:44:54,928
- Bye, Anna.
- Love your work.

583
00:44:55,011 --> 00:44:57,419
Bye, Hon.

584
00:45:03,854 --> 00:45:07,769
Sorry. They always do that
when l leave the house.

585
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:11,524
lt's a stupid thing.
l hate it.

586
00:45:21,622 --> 00:45:24,293
- "Floppy," huh ?
- lt's the hair.

587
00:45:24,376 --> 00:45:26,784
- Mm-hmm.
- lt's to do with the hair.

588
00:45:29,381 --> 00:45:31,670
Why is she in a wheelchair ?

589
00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:36,171
Uh, because she had an accident
about 18 months ago.

590
00:45:36,263 --> 00:45:39,431
And the pregnancy thing,
is that to do with the accident ?

591
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:40,928
You know, l'm not sure.

592
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:44,305
l don't think they tried for kids
before, as fate would have it.

593
00:45:52,823 --> 00:45:55,825
Do you want to, um--

594
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:59,030
My place is just, um--

595
00:45:59,122 --> 00:46:01,280
Too complicated.

596
00:46:01,374 --> 00:46:03,663
That's fine.

597
00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:10,749
Busy tomorrow ?

598
00:46:12,845 --> 00:46:16,261
- l thought you were leaving tomorrow.
- l was.

599
00:46:19,101 --> 00:46:21,177
All these streets round here have...

600
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,725
these mysterious communal gardens
in the middle of them.

601
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:26,186
- They're like little villages.
- Let's go in.

602
00:46:26,275 --> 00:46:28,849
Ah, no, that's the point.
They're private villages.

603
00:46:28,945 --> 00:46:31,863
Only the people who live round the edges
are allowed in.

604
00:46:31,948 --> 00:46:35,234
Oh. You abide by rules like that ?

605
00:46:35,327 --> 00:46:37,652
l don't. No, no.
But others do.

606
00:46:37,746 --> 00:46:40,118
l just do what l want.

607
00:46:40,207 --> 00:46:43,125
Um-- Right.

608
00:46:46,422 --> 00:46:49,257
Whoopsidaisies.

609
00:46:49,342 --> 00:46:51,880
What did you say ?

610
00:46:51,969 --> 00:46:54,591
- Nothing.
- Yes, you did.

611
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:58,809
- No, I didn't.
- You said, "Whoopsidaisies."

612
00:46:58,893 --> 00:47:02,180
No one says, "Whoopsidaisies," do they ?
l mean, unless they're--

613
00:47:02,273 --> 00:47:05,606
There is no "unless." Because no one
has said "Whoopsidaisies" for 50 years.

614
00:47:05,693 --> 00:47:09,560
And even then it was-- it was just
little girls with blonde ringlets.

615
00:47:09,655 --> 00:47:13,819
Exactly. Right.
So here we go again.

616
00:47:15,745 --> 00:47:18,663
Oh ! Oh ! Whoopsidaisies.

617
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,871
Yeah, well, it's a disease.
lt's a clinical thing.

618
00:47:22,961 --> 00:47:26,710
l'm taking pills and having injections.
And l'm told it won't last long.

619
00:47:26,798 --> 00:47:29,752
- Okay, stand aside.
- l don't think that's a good idea.

620
00:47:29,843 --> 00:47:32,845
Really, it's quite, um, tricky.
Anna.

621
00:47:34,515 --> 00:47:38,679
Anna, don't. lt's harder than it--
No, it's not. lt's easy.

622
00:47:46,778 --> 00:47:48,688
Come on, Flopsy.

623
00:47:48,781 --> 00:47:50,939
Right.

624
00:47:51,033 --> 00:47:53,524
All right.

625
00:47:53,619 --> 00:47:57,569
Oh, bugger.

626
00:47:57,665 --> 00:48:01,164
Oh, God,
this could be very unpleasant.

627
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:08,707
Ay !
Bugger, bugger.

628
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:17,554
Now what in the world in this garden
could make that ordeal worthwhile ?

629
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:33,530
Nice garden.

630
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:08,859
"For June who loved this garden.

631
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:12,235
From Joseph who always sat beside her.''

632
00:49:15,957 --> 00:49:19,290
Some people do spend
their whole lives together.

633
00:49:53,747 --> 00:49:55,656
Come and sit with me.

634
00:50:08,555 --> 00:50:11,092
Bollocks ! Bollocks !

635
00:50:11,182 --> 00:50:14,054
- Have you seen my glasses ?
- No, afraid not.

636
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:18,308
Big, big bollocks !
Average day, my glasses are everywhere.

637
00:50:18,399 --> 00:50:20,806
Everywhere l look
there's a pair of glasses.

638
00:50:20,901 --> 00:50:23,606
But when l want to go to the cinema,
they've vanished.

639
00:50:23,696 --> 00:50:25,605
lt's one of life's real cruelties.

640
00:50:25,698 --> 00:50:29,150
That's compared to, like,
earthquakes in the Far East
or testicular cancer, is it ?

641
00:50:29,244 --> 00:50:31,569
Oh, shit.
ls that the time ?

642
00:50:31,663 --> 00:50:35,246
Thanks for all your help
on the glasses thing.

643
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:37,659
Oh, you're welcome.
Did you find them ?

644
00:50:37,753 --> 00:50:39,710
- Sort of.
- Great.

645
00:51:09,912 --> 00:51:11,821
So who left who ?

646
00:51:11,914 --> 00:51:14,785
- Uh, she left me.
- Why ?

647
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:18,162
- She saw through me.
- Uh-oh.

648
00:51:18,255 --> 00:51:21,540
That's not good.

649
00:51:21,633 --> 00:51:23,840
You can give me
Anna Scott any day.

650
00:51:23,927 --> 00:51:26,845
l didn't like her last film. Fell asleep
as soon as the lights went down.

651
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:28,839
l don't really care
what the film's like.

652
00:51:28,932 --> 00:51:31,637
Any film with her in,
it's fine by me.

653
00:51:33,687 --> 00:51:35,846
She's not my type at all.
l prefer the other one.

654
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:38,431
You know, blonde, sweet-looking.

655
00:51:38,526 --> 00:51:40,435
You know, what's-her-name.

656
00:51:40,528 --> 00:51:42,817
Has an orgasm every time
you take her out for a cup of coffee.

657
00:51:42,906 --> 00:51:45,029
Meg Ryan.

658
00:51:45,116 --> 00:51:48,532
No, she's too wholesome.
The point about Miss Scott is...

659
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:51,538
she's got that twinkle in her eyes.

660
00:51:51,624 --> 00:51:54,293
Probably drug-induced.
Spends most of her life in bloody rehab.

661
00:51:54,376 --> 00:51:56,950
Well, whatever.
She's so clearly up for it.

662
00:51:57,046 --> 00:51:59,963
You see, most girls, they're all like,
"Stay away, chum."

663
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:04,129
But Anna,
she is absolutely gagging for it.

664
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:08,678
Do you know that in over 50°%
of the languages,

665
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:12,551
the word for "actress" is
the same as the word for "prostitute" ?

666
00:52:12,646 --> 00:52:15,267
Where did you get that from ?

667
00:52:15,357 --> 00:52:20,019
And Anna is your definitive actress,

668
00:52:20,112 --> 00:52:23,897
someone really filthy
you can just flip over and start again.

669
00:52:25,493 --> 00:52:28,743
- Right, that's it. Sorry.
- No, no. There's really no point.

670
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:33,914
Um, sorry--
sorry to disturb you guys.

671
00:52:34,002 --> 00:52:36,409
- But, um--
- Can l help ?

672
00:52:36,504 --> 00:52:40,040
Well, yeah. l wish l hadn't overheard
your conversation, but l did.

673
00:52:40,134 --> 00:52:42,707
And, um, l just think, you know,

674
00:52:42,803 --> 00:52:45,721
the person you're talking about
is a real person.

675
00:52:45,806 --> 00:52:48,760
And l think she probably deserves
a little bit more consideration...

676
00:52:48,851 --> 00:52:51,520
rather than having jerks like you
drooling over her.

677
00:52:51,604 --> 00:52:54,273
Oh, sod off, mate.
What are you, her dad ?

678
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:04,279
- l'm sorry.
- No, l love that you tried.

679
00:53:04,368 --> 00:53:07,238
Time was l'd have done the same thing.
ln fact--

680
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:14,119
Hi.

681
00:53:15,588 --> 00:53:17,628
Oh, my God.

682
00:53:17,715 --> 00:53:20,206
l just wanted to apologize for
my friend. He's very sensitive.

683
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:21,760
Uh, look, l'm sorr--

684
00:53:21,845 --> 00:53:24,762
No, no, leave it. lt's, you know--
l'm sure you didn't mean any harm.

685
00:53:24,848 --> 00:53:27,304
l'm sure it was just friendly banter.

686
00:53:27,393 --> 00:53:30,310
l'm sure you guys have dicks
the size of peanuts. Enjoy your dinner.

687
00:53:30,396 --> 00:53:33,397
The tuna's really good.

688
00:53:35,693 --> 00:53:39,109
l shouldn't have done that.
l shouldn't have done that.

689
00:53:39,196 --> 00:53:42,114
- No, you were brilliant.
- l'm rash and l'm stupid.

690
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:45,285
What am l doing with you ?

691
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:47,992
Uh, l don't know, l'm afraid.

692
00:53:48,081 --> 00:53:49,991
l don't either.

693
00:53:54,504 --> 00:53:57,078
Here we are.

694
00:53:57,174 --> 00:53:59,084
Yes.

695
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:02,962
- Well, look--
- Do you wanna come up ?

696
00:54:05,266 --> 00:54:10,142
Well, there seems to be...
lots of reasons why l shouldn't, so--

697
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:13,147
There are lots of reasons.

698
00:54:16,445 --> 00:54:19,648
Do you wanna come up ?

699
00:54:23,077 --> 00:54:25,283
Give me five minutes ?

700
00:54:47,394 --> 00:54:50,729
To be able to do that
is such a wonderful thing.

701
00:54:50,815 --> 00:54:52,808
- You've got to go.
- Why ?

702
00:54:52,901 --> 00:54:58,026
Because my boyfriend who was in America
is, in fact, now in the next room.

703
00:54:58,114 --> 00:55:00,321
- Boyfriend ?
- Yes.

704
00:55:00,408 --> 00:55:03,992
- Baby, who is it ?
- Uh, it's, uh--

705
00:55:05,081 --> 00:55:07,868
- Uh--
- Uh, room service.

706
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:12,585
Oh. How you doing ? l thought you guys
always wore those, uh, penguin coats.

707
00:55:13,673 --> 00:55:15,582
Usually we do.

708
00:55:15,675 --> 00:55:18,510
But l was just, uh--
just changed to go home.

709
00:55:18,594 --> 00:55:22,807
And, um, then l thought
l'd take this final call.

710
00:55:22,891 --> 00:55:25,596
Oh, great. lf you don't mind,
l would like something too.

711
00:55:25,686 --> 00:55:28,259
Could you bring me up some
really, really cold water ?

712
00:55:28,355 --> 00:55:30,727
l'll see what l can do.

713
00:55:30,816 --> 00:55:35,229
- Still, not sparkling.
- Absolutely. lce-cold still water.

714
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,737
Unless it's illegal in the U.K. to serve
beverages below room temperature.

715
00:55:38,825 --> 00:55:42,692
l wouldn't want you going to jail
just to satisfy my whim, now.

716
00:55:42,787 --> 00:55:44,579
- No, l'm sure it's fine.
- Thank you.

717
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,499
Hey, one more thing.

718
00:55:47,584 --> 00:55:50,075
Could you adios these dirty dishes
and take out that trash too ?

719
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,999
- Uh--
- Right.

720
00:55:55,092 --> 00:55:57,500
No. No. Um, don't-- don't--
don't do that.

721
00:55:57,595 --> 00:55:59,967
l don't think
it's his job to clear.

722
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:04,267
Oh, l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
What's your name, man ?

723
00:56:05,561 --> 00:56:07,470
Bernie.

724
00:56:07,563 --> 00:56:09,771
Oh, listen, Bernie.

725
00:56:09,858 --> 00:56:13,144
Thank you.
l really appreciate it.

726
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:15,146
Hey, you.

727
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:24,488
So, tell me. Tell me, tell me.
Good surprise or nasty surprise ?

728
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:27,370
- Good surprise.
- Oh, you're such a liar.

729
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,868
She hates surprises.
Hey, what are you gonna order ?

730
00:56:29,963 --> 00:56:32,880
- Huh ?
- From him. What are you gonna order ?

731
00:56:32,966 --> 00:56:35,208
Um, l haven't decided yet.

732
00:56:35,301 --> 00:56:37,460
Oh, well, don't overdo it.

733
00:56:37,554 --> 00:56:41,599
l don't want people saying,
"There goes that famous actor
with the big, fat girlfriend."

734
00:56:43,894 --> 00:56:45,970
l should leave.

735
00:56:52,194 --> 00:56:55,646
This is a fairly strange reality
to be faced with.

736
00:56:56,992 --> 00:56:58,949
l'm so sorry.

737
00:57:01,663 --> 00:57:03,952
l don't know...

738
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:06,330
what to say.

739
00:57:06,418 --> 00:57:08,660
Well,

740
00:57:08,754 --> 00:57:10,877
l think, um,

741
00:57:10,964 --> 00:57:14,169
"goodbye" is traditional.

742
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:19,174
Come on.

743
00:59:19,268 --> 00:59:22,140
Open up.

744
00:59:22,231 --> 00:59:25,979
This is me.
Spikey.

745
00:59:27,528 --> 00:59:31,739
l'm in contact with some quite
important spiritual vibrations.

746
00:59:33,409 --> 00:59:37,241
Come on.
Hit me with it.

747
00:59:41,001 --> 00:59:43,871
- There's this girl--
- Aha.

748
00:59:43,962 --> 00:59:47,746
See, l been gettin' a female vibe.
Good.

749
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:50,462
Speak on, dear friend.

750
00:59:50,552 --> 00:59:53,090
She's someone who...

751
00:59:53,179 --> 00:59:56,265
can't be mine, and, uh,

752
00:59:58,477 --> 01:00:03,934
it's as if l've taken love heroin,
and now l can't ever have it again.

753
01:00:04,025 --> 01:00:07,228
l've opened Pandora's box
and there's trouble inside.

754
01:00:11,325 --> 01:00:13,816
Yeah.

755
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:16,484
Tricky.

756
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,489
Tricky.

757
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:23,954
l knew a girl at school
called Pandora.

758
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,836
Never got to see her box or--

759
01:00:29,928 --> 01:00:31,837
Right.

760
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:35,630
Right. Thanks. That's very helpful.

761
01:00:37,435 --> 01:00:41,018
You didn't know
she had a boyfriend ?

762
01:00:43,651 --> 01:00:45,608
Why ? Did you ?

763
01:00:47,154 --> 01:00:49,313
Oh, bloody hell.
l don't believe it.

764
01:00:49,407 --> 01:00:53,535
My whole life ruined because
l don't read Hello magazine.

765
01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:57,451
Let's face facts.
This was always a no-win situation.

766
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:01,408
Anna's... a goddess.

767
01:01:01,503 --> 01:01:04,540
You know what happens to mortals
who get involved with the gods.

768
01:01:04,631 --> 01:01:07,419
- Buggered, is it ?
- Every time.

769
01:01:07,509 --> 01:01:12,385
But don't despair. l think l have
the solution to your problems.

770
01:01:12,473 --> 01:01:15,225
- Really ?
- Mm-hmm. Her name is Tessa.

771
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:17,137
She works in the Contracts Department.

772
01:01:17,228 --> 01:01:20,514
The hair, l admit,
is unfashionably frizzy,

773
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:24,557
but she's bright as a button and kisses
like a nymphomaniac on death row.

774
01:01:24,653 --> 01:01:26,941
Apparently.

775
01:01:29,491 --> 01:01:32,113
Now... try.

776
01:01:35,164 --> 01:01:37,323
l got completely lost.

777
01:01:37,416 --> 01:01:40,086
lt's very difficult, isn't it ?
Everything's got the word
"Kensington" in it.

778
01:01:40,169 --> 01:01:43,538
Kensington Park Road. Kensington Garden.
Kensington bloody Park Garden.

779
01:01:43,631 --> 01:01:46,122
- Tessa, this is Bella, my wife.
- Hello.

780
01:01:46,217 --> 01:01:48,294
- You're in a wheelchair.
- That's right.

781
01:01:48,387 --> 01:01:50,794
And this is William.

782
01:01:50,889 --> 01:01:53,215
- Hello, William.
- Hi.

783
01:01:53,308 --> 01:01:56,345
- Max has told me everything about you.
- Has he ?

784
01:01:56,437 --> 01:01:59,058
Oh, yes.
You are a naughty boy.

785
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:01,436
- Wine ?
- Oh, yes, please.

786
01:02:01,525 --> 01:02:03,566
Come on, Willie.
Let's get sloshed.

787
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,693
- Red or white ?
- Red.

788
01:02:08,366 --> 01:02:10,692
Keziah.

789
01:02:12,204 --> 01:02:15,454
- Some woodcock ?
- No, thank you. l'm a fruitarian.

790
01:02:19,461 --> 01:02:22,249
What is a fruitarian, exactly ?

791
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:26,124
We believe that
fruits and vegetables have feelings,

792
01:02:26,219 --> 01:02:28,507
so we think cooking is cruel.

793
01:02:28,596 --> 01:02:32,594
We only eat things that have actually
fallen from the tree or bush,

794
01:02:32,683 --> 01:02:34,890
that are, in fact, dead already.

795
01:02:36,689 --> 01:02:40,935
Ah. Oh, right.

796
01:02:41,026 --> 01:02:42,935
Right.

797
01:02:43,028 --> 01:02:45,187
So, um, these carrots ?

798
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,902
- Have been murdered, yes.
- Murdered.

799
01:02:49,451 --> 01:02:52,572
Poor old carrots.
That's--

800
01:02:52,664 --> 01:02:54,573
That's beastly.

801
01:02:57,961 --> 01:03:01,045
Delicious coffee.

802
01:03:01,131 --> 01:03:03,669
l'm sorry about the lamb.

803
01:03:03,758 --> 01:03:08,505
No. l thought it was...
really, you know, interesting.

804
01:03:08,598 --> 01:03:11,634
lnteresting means inedible.

805
01:03:11,726 --> 01:03:15,142
Really inedible. Yes, you're right.

806
01:03:17,899 --> 01:03:21,647
Well, maybe we'll meet again.

807
01:03:21,736 --> 01:03:25,402
Yeah, yeah.
That would be, uh--

808
01:03:25,491 --> 01:03:27,448
be great.

809
01:03:34,959 --> 01:03:36,916
Bye.

810
01:03:55,981 --> 01:03:58,473
Well ?

811
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:00,477
Perfect.

812
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,776
Absolutely perfect.

813
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:08,076
And ?

814
01:04:08,161 --> 01:04:11,945
l think you've forgotten
what an unusual situation you two have.

815
01:04:14,126 --> 01:04:18,539
To find someone you actually... love,
who'll love you.

816
01:04:18,631 --> 01:04:21,501
The chances are always minuscule.

817
01:04:22,968 --> 01:04:24,877
Look at me.

818
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:29,514
Apart from the American, l've only
loved two girls, both total disasters.

819
01:04:29,601 --> 01:04:31,640
- That's not fair.
- One of them marries me,
then leaves me...

820
01:04:31,728 --> 01:04:34,764
faster than you can say
"lndiana Jones."

821
01:04:34,856 --> 01:04:38,272
And the other-- who seriously
ought to have known better--

822
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,317
casually marries my best friend.

823
01:04:40,403 --> 01:04:44,532
- She still loves you, though.
- ln a depressingly asexual way.

824
01:04:46,702 --> 01:04:48,909
l never fancied you much, actually.

825
01:04:48,996 --> 01:04:52,531
Oh, God.

826
01:04:52,625 --> 01:04:56,290
l loved you.
You were terribly funny, but...

827
01:04:56,379 --> 01:04:58,621
all that kissing my ears.

828
01:04:58,715 --> 01:05:01,385
l don't believe it.
This is just getting worse.

829
01:05:01,468 --> 01:05:04,173
l shall find myself 30 years from now
still sitting on this sofa.

830
01:05:05,723 --> 01:05:09,471
- Do you wanna stay ?
- Yeah. Why not ?

831
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,347
All that awaits me at home
is a masturbating Welshman.

832
01:05:16,442 --> 01:05:18,482
Here we go.

833
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:20,527
- Good night.
- Night.

834
01:05:39,634 --> 01:05:41,710
- See you.
- Right.

835
01:05:50,062 --> 01:05:52,387
Guilty.
Very, very guilty.

836
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:54,438
So it seems.

837
01:06:41,909 --> 01:06:44,482
Hi.

838
01:06:46,163 --> 01:06:48,370
Can l come in ?

839
01:06:48,457 --> 01:06:50,366
Come in.

840
01:06:57,676 --> 01:07:00,760
They were taken years ago.

841
01:07:00,846 --> 01:07:03,763
l know it was--

842
01:07:03,849 --> 01:07:08,475
But l was poor and--
lt happens a lot.

843
01:07:08,562 --> 01:07:10,935
That's not an excuse.
l just--

844
01:07:13,568 --> 01:07:16,734
But to make matters worse,

845
01:07:16,821 --> 01:07:20,024
it now appears as though...

846
01:07:20,116 --> 01:07:24,114
someone was filming me as well.

847
01:07:24,203 --> 01:07:27,953
So what was a stupid
photo shoot...

848
01:07:28,042 --> 01:07:30,330
now looks like a porn film.

849
01:07:32,838 --> 01:07:35,875
The pictures have been sold
and they're just...

850
01:07:35,966 --> 01:07:37,876
everywhere.

851
01:07:41,222 --> 01:07:43,464
l didn't know where to go.

852
01:07:45,977 --> 01:07:47,887
The hotel's surrounded.

853
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:55,436
l know it's been months, but--

854
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:57,901
This is the place.

855
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,532
Thank you.

856
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,156
l'm just in London...

857
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:11,086
for two days,
but what with your papers,

858
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:14,088
it's the worst place to be.

859
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:18,006
These pictures are just so horrible,
and they're so grainy.

860
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:20,004
lt makes me look like--

861
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:22,137
Don't think about it.

862
01:08:24,477 --> 01:08:26,765
We'll sort it out.

863
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:34,020
What would you like ?
Tea ?

864
01:08:34,112 --> 01:08:36,069
Bath ?

865
01:08:40,118 --> 01:08:43,285
A bath would be great.

866
01:08:45,457 --> 01:08:47,367
Oh, Christ alive !

867
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:54,462
Brilliant. Fantastic.

868
01:08:57,971 --> 01:09:00,094
Magnificent.

869
01:09:06,605 --> 01:09:08,515
You must be Spike.

870
01:09:22,205 --> 01:09:25,740
- Hi.
- Just...

871
01:09:25,834 --> 01:09:27,743
checkin'.

872
01:09:32,549 --> 01:09:34,506
Thank you, God.

873
01:09:38,348 --> 01:09:40,803
l'm really sorry about last time.

874
01:09:40,892 --> 01:09:43,264
- Oh--
- He just flew in.

875
01:09:43,353 --> 01:09:45,262
- l had no idea.
- All right.

876
01:09:45,355 --> 01:09:49,933
ln fact, l had no idea
if he was ever gonna fly in again.

877
01:09:50,026 --> 01:09:53,111
lt's not often one
has the opportunity to adios...

878
01:09:53,197 --> 01:09:56,068
the plates of
a major Hollywood film star.

879
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:58,696
lt was, um--
lt was thrilling for me.

880
01:10:02,373 --> 01:10:04,330
So how is he ?

881
01:10:06,419 --> 01:10:08,377
l don't know.

882
01:10:11,174 --> 01:10:13,084
lt just got to the point...

883
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:16,628
where l couldn't remember
any of the reasons why we were together.

884
01:10:17,931 --> 01:10:19,888
And you and love ?

885
01:10:22,436 --> 01:10:25,603
Oh, well, there's a question, um,

886
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:28,228
without an interesting answer.

887
01:10:32,363 --> 01:10:34,273
l have thought about you.

888
01:10:36,326 --> 01:10:39,445
- Oh.
- lt's just that...

889
01:10:39,537 --> 01:10:43,038
any time l've tried to keep...

890
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:46,957
anything normal
with a person that was...

891
01:10:47,046 --> 01:10:49,204
normal,
it's just been a disaster.

892
01:10:49,298 --> 01:10:53,627
Listen, l appreciate that.
Absolutely.

893
01:10:53,719 --> 01:10:56,674
So what is that,
a film you're doing ?

894
01:10:56,765 --> 01:11:00,893
Um, start in L.A. on Tuesday.

895
01:11:00,978 --> 01:11:04,014
Would you like me to
take you through your lines ?

896
01:11:04,106 --> 01:11:07,190
Would you ?
'Cause it's all talk, talk, talk.

897
01:11:07,276 --> 01:11:09,434
Hand it over.

898
01:11:10,737 --> 01:11:14,404
Right.
Um, basic plot ?

899
01:11:14,492 --> 01:11:17,529
l'm a difficult but brilliant
junior officer...

900
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:22,496
who in about 20 minutes is gonna
save the world from nuclear disaster.

901
01:11:22,584 --> 01:11:24,825
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Well done, you.

902
01:11:24,919 --> 01:11:27,161
"Message from Command. Would you
like them to send in the H.K.'s ?"

903
01:11:27,255 --> 01:11:30,257
No. Turn over four T.R.S.'s
and tell them we need radar feedback...

904
01:11:30,342 --> 01:11:32,252
before the K.F.T.'s return at 1900.

905
01:11:32,344 --> 01:11:35,963
Then inform the Pentagon we'll need
Black Star cover from 1000 through 1215.

906
01:11:36,057 --> 01:11:40,006
And if you say one word about how many
mistakes l made in that speech,
l'll pelt you with olives.

907
01:11:40,102 --> 01:11:42,676
- Very well, Captain.
l'll pass that on straightaway.
- Thank you.

908
01:11:42,772 --> 01:11:44,681
- How many mistakes did l make ?
- Eleven.

909
01:11:44,774 --> 01:11:49,022
- Damn it. And Wainwright--
- Cartwright.

910
01:11:49,112 --> 01:11:51,271
Cartwright, Wainwright,
whatever your name is,

911
01:11:51,365 --> 01:11:53,274
l promised little Jimmy
l'd be home for his birthday,

912
01:11:53,367 --> 01:11:55,858
so could you get a message to him
that l may be late.

913
01:11:55,953 --> 01:11:58,111
Certainly.
And, uh, little Johnny ?

914
01:11:58,205 --> 01:12:00,577
- My son's name is Johnny ?
- Yep.

915
01:12:00,666 --> 01:12:03,371
- Then get a message to him too.
- l'll do what l can, Captain,

916
01:12:03,461 --> 01:12:05,370
but l can't promise anything.

917
01:12:05,463 --> 01:12:10,125
And Cartwright goes.

918
01:12:10,218 --> 01:12:14,346
- What do you think ?
- Gripping. lt's not Jane Austen.

919
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:17,386
lt's not Henry James,
but it's... gripping.

920
01:12:17,476 --> 01:12:21,225
- Think l should do Henry James instead?
- You would be brilliant.

921
01:12:21,313 --> 01:12:26,652
But this writer-- writers--
they're pretty damn good too.

922
01:12:26,736 --> 01:12:29,309
You never get anyone
on Wings of the Dove saying,

923
01:12:29,405 --> 01:12:32,192
"lnform the Pentagon
we need Black Star cover."

924
01:12:32,283 --> 01:12:34,193
For me the book is the poorer for it.

925
01:12:39,499 --> 01:12:41,907
l can't believe you have that picture.

926
01:12:43,503 --> 01:12:45,911
You like Chagall ?

927
01:12:46,006 --> 01:12:50,669
l do. lt feels like
how love should be--

928
01:12:50,762 --> 01:12:53,467
floating through a dark blue sky.

929
01:12:53,556 --> 01:12:56,261
With a goat, playing a violin.

930
01:12:56,351 --> 01:12:58,260
Well, yes.

931
01:12:58,353 --> 01:13:01,437
Happiness isn't happiness
without a violin-playing goat.

932
01:13:22,588 --> 01:13:24,545
You have big feet.

933
01:13:27,217 --> 01:13:31,381
Yes.
Yes, always have had.

934
01:13:33,223 --> 01:13:36,806
You know what they say
about men with big feet.

935
01:13:38,104 --> 01:13:40,144
No.
What's that ?

936
01:13:40,231 --> 01:13:43,850
Uh, big feet,

937
01:13:43,943 --> 01:13:46,613
large... shoes.

938
01:13:52,452 --> 01:13:54,362
The thing that is so irritating...

939
01:13:54,455 --> 01:13:57,824
is that now l'm so fierce
when it comes to nudity clauses.

940
01:13:57,917 --> 01:14:00,622
You actually have... clauses
in your contract about nudity ?

941
01:14:00,711 --> 01:14:02,620
Definitely.

942
01:14:02,713 --> 01:14:06,296
"You may show the dent of the top of the
artist's buttocks, but neither cheek."

943
01:14:06,384 --> 01:14:09,587
Or if there's
a stunt bottom being used...

944
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:12,634
"artist must have full consultation."

945
01:14:12,724 --> 01:14:17,885
- You have a stunt bottom ?
- l could have a stunt bottom, yes.

946
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:22,392
Are people tempted to go
for better bottoms than their own?

947
01:14:22,484 --> 01:14:25,106
Yeah. l would.
This is important stuff.

948
01:14:25,195 --> 01:14:29,194
lt's one hell of a job, isn't it ?
What do you put on your passport ?

949
01:14:29,284 --> 01:14:31,656
"Profession: Mel Gibson's bottom."

950
01:14:31,745 --> 01:14:33,903
Actually, Mel does his own ass work.

951
01:14:33,997 --> 01:14:35,954
- Right.
- Why wouldn't he ?

952
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:40,121
- Absolutely.
- lt's delicious.

953
01:14:40,211 --> 01:14:43,546
What, the ice cream
or Mel Gibson's bottom ?

954
01:14:43,632 --> 01:14:46,468
Both. Equally.

955
01:14:46,552 --> 01:14:49,173
But you wouldn't necessarily lick both ?

956
01:14:49,263 --> 01:14:53,593
Well, this is tart.

957
01:14:53,684 --> 01:14:55,843
And fuzz-free.

958
01:14:59,942 --> 01:15:02,563
And, uh--

959
01:15:02,653 --> 01:15:05,322
Bedroom.
There's clean sheets.

960
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:17,781
Today's been a good day,

961
01:15:17,877 --> 01:15:20,795
which in the circumstances is...

962
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,668
unexpected.

963
01:15:23,758 --> 01:15:26,047
Thank you.

964
01:15:29,597 --> 01:15:32,683
Anyway, um,

965
01:15:32,768 --> 01:15:34,725
time for bed.

966
01:15:35,896 --> 01:15:37,854
Or sofa bed.

967
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:46,195
Good night.

968
01:15:46,282 --> 01:15:48,240
Good night.

969
01:16:33,833 --> 01:16:35,791
Oh, my God.

970
01:16:43,927 --> 01:16:46,335
Hello ?

971
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:48,339
Hello.

972
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:53,684
-Spike.
-l wonder if l could have a little word.

973
01:16:53,772 --> 01:16:57,057
- Right.
- l don't want to interfere or anything,

974
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:59,819
but she's just split up
from her boyfriend, right ?

975
01:16:59,903 --> 01:17:03,687
- Maybe.
- And she's in your house.

976
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,700
- Yes.
- And you get on very well.

977
01:17:10,414 --> 01:17:13,119
- Yes.
- Well, isn't this, perhaps,

978
01:17:13,209 --> 01:17:15,285
a nice opportunity to...

979
01:17:19,048 --> 01:17:20,957
slip her one.

980
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:23,007
Spike, for God's sakes.
She's in trouble. Get a grip.

981
01:17:23,094 --> 01:17:25,764
You think it's the wrong moment.
Fair enough.

982
01:17:30,936 --> 01:17:32,893
- Do you mind if l have a go ?
- Spike !

983
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:35,850
- Okay.
- l'll talk to you in the morning.

984
01:17:35,941 --> 01:17:40,687
Okay.
Might be too late, but okay.

985
01:17:50,498 --> 01:17:54,199
Please, sod off.

986
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:56,203
- Okay. All right.
- No. No, no !

987
01:17:56,296 --> 01:18:00,081
Wait ! l thought you were,
um, someone else.

988
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:05,593
l thought you were Spike.
l'm thrilled that you're not.

989
01:19:07,164 --> 01:19:09,121
Wow.

990
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:13,327
What ?

991
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:15,329
Nothing.

992
01:19:50,502 --> 01:19:53,172
lt does strike me as,

993
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:56,956
well, surreal that l'm allowed
to see you naked.

994
01:19:57,051 --> 01:20:00,005
- You and every person in this country.
- l'm sorry.

995
01:20:01,555 --> 01:20:04,224
What is it about men and nudity, huh ?

996
01:20:04,308 --> 01:20:06,218
Particularly breasts.

997
01:20:06,311 --> 01:20:10,973
- How can you be so interested in them ?
- Well--

998
01:20:11,066 --> 01:20:13,604
But, seriously,
they're just breasts.

999
01:20:13,693 --> 01:20:16,528
Every second person
in the world has them.

1000
01:20:16,613 --> 01:20:20,314
More than that, when you think about it.
Meat Loaf has a very nice pair.

1001
01:20:20,408 --> 01:20:23,861
But they're odd-looking.

1002
01:20:23,955 --> 01:20:26,742
They're for milk.
Your mother has them.

1003
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:30,332
You've seen a thousand of them.
What's all the fuss about ?

1004
01:20:30,419 --> 01:20:33,670
Actually, l can't think
what it is, really.

1005
01:20:33,756 --> 01:20:36,378
Let me just have a quick look.

1006
01:20:41,015 --> 01:20:44,015
Nope, nope. Beats me.

1007
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:50,639
Rita Hayworth used to say,

1008
01:20:50,733 --> 01:20:54,434
"They go to bed with Gilda,
they wake up with me."

1009
01:20:54,529 --> 01:20:59,654
- Who was Gilda ?
- Her most famous part.

1010
01:20:59,743 --> 01:21:02,660
Men went to bed with the dream,

1011
01:21:02,746 --> 01:21:06,411
and they didn't like it
when they woke up with the reality.

1012
01:21:08,001 --> 01:21:09,910
Do you feel that way ?

1013
01:21:12,673 --> 01:21:16,374
You are lovelier this morning
than you have ever been.

1014
01:21:20,098 --> 01:21:22,007
l'll be right back.

1015
01:21:35,614 --> 01:21:37,523
Breakfast in bed.

1016
01:21:37,616 --> 01:21:41,994
- Oh.
- Or it's brunch or lunch or something.

1017
01:21:42,079 --> 01:21:44,785
My God.

1018
01:21:44,875 --> 01:21:46,784
Can l stay a bit longer ?

1019
01:21:49,588 --> 01:21:51,497
Stay forever.

1020
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:56,292
Okay.
Oh. Forgot the jam.

1021
01:22:00,641 --> 01:22:03,014
l'll get the jam,
you get the door.

1022
01:22:18,911 --> 01:22:20,785
Jesus Christ.

1023
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,913
What ?

1024
01:22:26,001 --> 01:22:28,327
What is it ?

1025
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:31,375
- Nothing, really.
- You're up to something.

1026
01:22:31,466 --> 01:22:34,337
Anna, no, please !

1027
01:22:36,888 --> 01:22:41,681
My God. And they got a picture of you
dressed like that.

1028
01:22:41,768 --> 01:22:43,512
Yes.

1029
01:22:45,355 --> 01:22:47,313
Undressed like this, yeah.

1030
01:22:49,152 --> 01:22:52,770
- Morning, darling ones.
- lt's me. The press are here.

1031
01:22:52,864 --> 01:22:55,070
No, there are hundreds of them.

1032
01:22:55,158 --> 01:22:57,779
My brilliant plan
was not so brilliant. l know.

1033
01:22:57,869 --> 01:23:01,119
l know. l know.
Just get over here.

1034
01:23:01,205 --> 01:23:03,163
Damn it.

1035
01:23:08,339 --> 01:23:11,375
- Um, l wouldn't go outside.
- Why not ?

1036
01:23:14,053 --> 01:23:16,722
- Just take my word for it.
- Oh.

1037
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:41,453
How did l look ?
Not bad.

1038
01:23:41,541 --> 01:23:45,538
Not at all bad.
Well-chosen briefs, l'd say.

1039
01:23:45,628 --> 01:23:48,298
Chicks love grey.

1040
01:23:48,381 --> 01:23:51,050
Nice firm buttocks.

1041
01:23:55,014 --> 01:23:56,923
How are you doing ?

1042
01:23:57,016 --> 01:23:59,589
How do you think l'm doing ?

1043
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:03,261
- l don't know what happened.
- l do.

1044
01:24:03,355 --> 01:24:08,268
Your furry friend thought he'd make
a buck telling the papers where l was.

1045
01:24:08,361 --> 01:24:10,271
- That's not true.
- Really ?

1046
01:24:10,363 --> 01:24:13,697
The entire British press
got up this morning and thought,
"l know where Anna Scott is.

1047
01:24:13,784 --> 01:24:16,701
She's in that house with the blue door
in Notting Hill.''

1048
01:24:16,787 --> 01:24:19,538
Then you go out
in your goddam underwear !

1049
01:24:19,623 --> 01:24:22,577
-l went out in my goddam underwear too.
-Get out !

1050
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:24,708
Sorry.

1051
01:24:24,796 --> 01:24:28,628
- l'm so sorry.
- This is such an unbelievable mess.

1052
01:24:28,716 --> 01:24:31,634
l come to you to protect myself
against more crappy gossip,

1053
01:24:31,719 --> 01:24:33,628
and now l've landed in it
all over again.

1054
01:24:33,721 --> 01:24:36,556
For God's sake, l've got a boyfriend !

1055
01:24:36,641 --> 01:24:40,342
- You have ?
- As far as they're concerned l do.

1056
01:24:40,437 --> 01:24:45,265
And now, tomorrow there'll be
pictures of you in every newspaper
from here to Timbuktu !

1057
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:48,313
l know that, but...
just let's stay calm.

1058
01:24:48,404 --> 01:24:52,152
You stay calm ! This is a perfect
situation for you, isn't it?

1059
01:24:52,241 --> 01:24:54,566
Minimum input, maximum publicity.

1060
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:57,234
Everywhere you go, people will say,
"Well done, you.

1061
01:24:57,330 --> 01:25:01,114
You slept with that actress.
We saw the pictures.''

1062
01:25:01,209 --> 01:25:03,961
- That is spectacularly unfair.
- That's yours.

1063
01:25:04,045 --> 01:25:05,955
Maybe it'll even help business.

1064
01:25:06,047 --> 01:25:08,621
Buy a boring book about Egypt
from the guy that screwed Anna Scott.

1065
01:25:08,717 --> 01:25:12,502
Stop ! Stop ! l beg you !

1066
01:25:12,597 --> 01:25:14,839
Calm down.
How about a cup of tea ?

1067
01:25:14,932 --> 01:25:17,008
l don't want
a goddam cup of tea.

1068
01:25:18,394 --> 01:25:21,064
l just wanna go home.

1069
01:25:21,147 --> 01:25:23,899
Spike, see who that is,
and put some clothes on, for God's sake.

1070
01:25:23,983 --> 01:25:26,605
Looks like a chauffeur to me.

1071
01:25:26,694 --> 01:25:29,103
Spike owes you
an expensive dinner or holiday,

1072
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:32,234
depending who's got the brains
to get the going rate on betrayal.

1073
01:25:32,326 --> 01:25:34,235
That is not true.
Wait a minute.

1074
01:25:34,328 --> 01:25:36,997
This is crazy behaviour.

1075
01:25:37,081 --> 01:25:40,331
Can't we just
laugh about all this ?

1076
01:25:40,417 --> 01:25:44,118
Seriously. ln the huge sweep of things,
this stuff doesn't matter.

1077
01:25:44,213 --> 01:25:47,417
What he's gonna say next is
there's people starving in the Sudan.

1078
01:25:47,509 --> 01:25:51,257
Well, there are, and we don't
have to go anywhere near that far.

1079
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:54,264
My best friend slipped down stairs,
cracked her back...

1080
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:56,887
and she's in a wheelchair
for the rest of her life.

1081
01:25:56,977 --> 01:26:01,307
All l'm asking for is
a normal amount of perspective.

1082
01:26:01,399 --> 01:26:03,890
You're right.
Of course, you're right.

1083
01:26:03,985 --> 01:26:06,772
lt's just that l've dealt
with this garbage for ten years.

1084
01:26:06,863 --> 01:26:08,772
You've had it for ten minutes.

1085
01:26:08,865 --> 01:26:12,316
Our perspectives are very different.

1086
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:15,909
Today's newspapers will be lining
tomorrow's wastepaper bin.

1087
01:26:15,997 --> 01:26:18,121
- Excuse me ?
- You know.

1088
01:26:18,209 --> 01:26:20,367
lt's just one day.

1089
01:26:20,461 --> 01:26:24,044
Tomorrow, today's papers
will all have been thrown out.

1090
01:26:24,131 --> 01:26:26,290
You really don't get it.

1091
01:26:26,383 --> 01:26:28,791
This story will be filed.

1092
01:26:28,886 --> 01:26:33,763
Every time anyone writes anything
about me, they'll dig up these photos.

1093
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:35,843
Newspapers last forever.

1094
01:26:35,936 --> 01:26:38,771
l'll regret this forever.

1095
01:26:40,899 --> 01:26:42,808
Right.

1096
01:26:46,113 --> 01:26:48,485
Right.

1097
01:26:48,573 --> 01:26:50,816
l will feel the opposite,

1098
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:55,038
if that's okay by you, and, uh,

1099
01:26:55,123 --> 01:26:58,124
always be glad that you...
came to stay.

1100
01:27:00,628 --> 01:27:03,546
But, um, you're probably right.

1101
01:27:03,631 --> 01:27:05,540
You better go.

1102
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,502
Was it you ?

1103
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:55,677
l may have told a few people
down at the pub.

1104
01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:59,390
Right.

1105
01:29:49,101 --> 01:29:52,849
Have l got something for you. Something
which will make you love me so much,

1106
01:29:52,938 --> 01:29:56,223
you will want to hug me every day
for the rest of my life.

1107
01:29:56,316 --> 01:29:59,234
Blimey. What is it ?

1108
01:29:59,319 --> 01:30:01,526
Phone number of Anna Scott's agent
in London...

1109
01:30:01,613 --> 01:30:04,152
and her agent in New York.

1110
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:11,448
Listen, you think about her all
the time. Now you can ring her.

1111
01:30:11,541 --> 01:30:15,076
Yeah. Brilliant. Thanks.

1112
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:18,171
l'll see you tonight.
Hey, Marty. Ooh ! Sexy cardi.

1113
01:30:44,284 --> 01:30:48,578
Shh ! Hello !
l have a little speech to make.

1114
01:30:48,664 --> 01:30:53,540
l won't stand up because
l can't... be bothered.

1115
01:30:53,628 --> 01:30:58,373
Exactly a year ago today, this man here
started the finest restaurant in London.

1116
01:30:58,466 --> 01:31:00,375
- Hear, hear.
- Thank you very much.

1117
01:31:00,468 --> 01:31:03,006
Unfortunately,
no one ever came to eat here.

1118
01:31:03,096 --> 01:31:05,931
lt's a tiny hiccup.

1119
01:31:06,015 --> 01:31:09,302
And so we have to face the fact
that from next week,

1120
01:31:09,395 --> 01:31:11,304
we must find somewhere new to eat.

1121
01:31:12,690 --> 01:31:16,984
l just want to say to Tony...
don't take it personally.

1122
01:31:17,069 --> 01:31:20,901
The more l think about things, the more
l see no rhyme or reason in life.

1123
01:31:20,990 --> 01:31:24,656
No one knows why some things work out
and some things don't.

1124
01:31:24,745 --> 01:31:26,536
Why some of us get lucky...

1125
01:31:26,622 --> 01:31:29,788
- and some of us--
- Get fired.

1126
01:31:29,875 --> 01:31:31,155
- What ?
- No !

1127
01:31:31,251 --> 01:31:34,003
Yeah, well, it seems
they're shifting the whole outfit...

1128
01:31:34,087 --> 01:31:36,661
much more towards
the emerging markets.

1129
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:41,384
And, of course, well,
l was total crap, so--

1130
01:31:41,471 --> 01:31:43,713
A toast to Bernie-- the worst
stockbroker in the whole world.

1131
01:31:43,807 --> 01:31:46,511
l thank you.
And Tony, the worst restaurateur.

1132
01:31:46,601 --> 01:31:49,174
- Tony and Bernie. Both crap...
- The terrible two.

1133
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:51,940
in their own special ways.

1134
01:31:54,692 --> 01:31:57,101
Since it's an evening
of announcements,

1135
01:31:57,196 --> 01:32:00,565
uh, l've also got one.

1136
01:32:00,658 --> 01:32:03,861
Um, l've decided to get engaged.

1137
01:32:03,953 --> 01:32:09,374
l've found myself a nice,
slightly odd-looking bloke...

1138
01:32:09,458 --> 01:32:12,663
who l know is gonna make me happy
for the rest of my life.

1139
01:32:14,339 --> 01:32:17,009
Wait a sec. l mean, l--

1140
01:32:17,092 --> 01:32:21,090
l'm your brother. l don't know
anything about this. ls he--

1141
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:24,714
ls he financially viable ?

1142
01:32:24,808 --> 01:32:27,478
He's an artist...
with brilliant prospects.

1143
01:32:30,064 --> 01:32:33,184
This is a secret
you've been keeping from me.

1144
01:32:33,276 --> 01:32:35,316
By the way, it's you.

1145
01:32:38,656 --> 01:32:41,823
- Me ?
- What do you think ?

1146
01:32:43,661 --> 01:32:45,620
Well, yeah.

1147
01:32:47,667 --> 01:32:49,992
Groovy.

1148
01:32:50,086 --> 01:32:54,297
Excuse me.
Are there any more announcements ?

1149
01:32:54,382 --> 01:32:56,920
Well, actually, yes.

1150
01:32:57,009 --> 01:32:59,927
l feel l should
apologize to everyone...

1151
01:33:00,012 --> 01:33:02,385
for my behaviour
over the last six months.

1152
01:33:02,474 --> 01:33:06,092
l have, as you know,
been somewhat down in the mouth.

1153
01:33:06,186 --> 01:33:09,721
There's an understatement.
There are dead people on better form.

1154
01:33:09,815 --> 01:33:13,515
But l just wish to make it clear
that l've turned a corner,

1155
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:17,691
and, um, henceforward intend
to be impressively happy.

1156
01:33:23,705 --> 01:33:27,572
Without a love of my own

1157
01:33:31,588 --> 01:33:35,836
-Blue moon
-Ba-boom, ba-boom

1158
01:33:35,926 --> 01:33:39,342
You knew just what l was there for

1159
01:33:39,430 --> 01:33:42,301
Oh, God. l'm horribly drunk.

1160
01:33:42,391 --> 01:33:45,476
You heard me saying a prayer for

1161
01:33:45,561 --> 01:33:47,637
- Come here.
-Ba-boom, ba-boom

1162
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:50,898
Someone l really could care for

1163
01:33:50,984 --> 01:33:55,314
So you've laid the ghost ?

1164
01:33:55,405 --> 01:33:57,279
l believe l have.

1165
01:33:57,366 --> 01:34:00,699
Don't give a damn
about the famous girl?

1166
01:34:00,786 --> 01:34:02,577
No.

1167
01:34:02,663 --> 01:34:05,450
No, l don't think l do.

1168
01:34:05,542 --> 01:34:08,412
Which means you won't be distracted
by the fact that she's back in London...

1169
01:34:08,503 --> 01:34:10,163
grasping her Oscar...

1170
01:34:10,255 --> 01:34:13,256
and currently to be found filming,
most days, on Hampstead Heath.

1171
01:34:15,093 --> 01:34:17,050
Oh, God, no.

1172
01:34:20,307 --> 01:34:23,095
So not over her, in fact.

1173
01:35:06,648 --> 01:35:09,565
- Can l help you ?
- Yeah, l'm, um--

1174
01:35:09,651 --> 01:35:12,024
- l'm looking for Anna Scott.
- Does she know you're coming ?

1175
01:35:12,113 --> 01:35:15,564
No. No, uh, she doesn't.

1176
01:35:15,658 --> 01:35:18,944
- l'm afraid l can't let you through.
- Right.

1177
01:35:19,036 --> 01:35:24,031
l mean, l am actually a friend.
l'm not a lunatic, but--

1178
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:26,996
- No, you basically, er--
- Can't let you through, sir.

1179
01:36:08,923 --> 01:36:10,382
Well, this is, uh--

1180
01:36:10,466 --> 01:36:13,800
l only found out
you were here yesterday.

1181
01:36:13,886 --> 01:36:17,636
- l was going to call, but l--
- Uh, Anna.

1182
01:36:17,724 --> 01:36:20,180
Yes. Um--

1183
01:36:20,269 --> 01:36:22,676
Things aren't going very well,
and it's our last day.

1184
01:36:22,771 --> 01:36:25,179
Absolutely, yeah.
You're clearly very busy.

1185
01:36:25,274 --> 01:36:27,681
But if-- if you could wait,

1186
01:36:27,776 --> 01:36:30,446
there are... things to say.

1187
01:36:34,909 --> 01:36:36,867
Okay.

1188
01:36:38,788 --> 01:36:41,706
Drink tea.
There's lots of tea.

1189
01:36:48,132 --> 01:36:50,089
Come and have a look.

1190
01:36:54,430 --> 01:36:57,597
Are you a fan of Henry James ?

1191
01:36:57,683 --> 01:37:00,435
- This is a Henry James film ?
- Yeah.

1192
01:37:07,653 --> 01:37:09,859
This is, uh, Harry.

1193
01:37:09,947 --> 01:37:13,150
He'll give you a pair of headphones
so you can hear the dialogue.

1194
01:37:13,242 --> 01:37:15,151
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.

1195
01:37:15,244 --> 01:37:17,865
- Hi.
- Hi. Here we go.

1196
01:37:17,955 --> 01:37:21,455
- Volume's on the side. Have a seat.
- Thank you.

1197
01:37:29,676 --> 01:37:33,127
We are living in cloud cuckoo land.
We'll never get this done today.

1198
01:37:33,221 --> 01:37:35,464
We've got to.
l have to be in New York on Thursday.

1199
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:39,721
Oh, stop showing off.
God, that's an enormous ass.

1200
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:44,024
- l'm not listening.
- But seriously, it's not fair.

1201
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:46,397
So many tragic young teenagers
with anorexia...

1202
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:49,107
and that girl has an ass
she could perfectly well share around...

1203
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:53,065
with at least ten other women
and still be big-bottomed.

1204
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:55,651
l would think, looking at
something nice like that,

1205
01:37:55,746 --> 01:37:59,909
you and your...
bony little excuse for an arse...

1206
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,159
would be well advised to keep quiet.

1207
01:38:02,252 --> 01:38:04,210
Now down to business.
The end of the scene.

1208
01:38:04,296 --> 01:38:07,463
Um, l ask you when you're
telling everyone, and you say--

1209
01:38:07,549 --> 01:38:11,714
Um, tomorrow will be soon enough.

1210
01:38:11,805 --> 01:38:14,212
And then l-- Right. Okay.

1211
01:38:14,307 --> 01:38:18,091
Say, who was that rather diffident chap
l saw you talking to round the back ?

1212
01:38:18,186 --> 01:38:20,143
No one.

1213
01:38:21,523 --> 01:38:24,560
Just some guy from the past. l--

1214
01:38:24,652 --> 01:38:28,566
lt's a bit of an awkward situation.
l don't know what he's doing here.

1215
01:38:45,716 --> 01:38:47,625
'Course.

1216
01:38:53,390 --> 01:38:56,476
Thanks. l've got to, um--

1217
01:38:56,561 --> 01:38:58,518
Any time.

1218
01:39:08,073 --> 01:39:11,489
Ladies and gentlemen,
can we have you on your first marks ?

1219
01:39:11,576 --> 01:39:13,736
On your first marks !

1220
01:39:25,842 --> 01:39:29,176
Uh, l-l do hate to disturb you
whilst you're cooking the books,

1221
01:39:29,263 --> 01:39:32,429
but, uh, there's a delivery for you.

1222
01:39:32,516 --> 01:39:34,841
Martin, really.
Can't you just do it yourself ?

1223
01:39:34,935 --> 01:39:39,478
But you see, this is not for the shop.
This is for you.

1224
01:39:40,566 --> 01:39:42,143
Right. Okay.

1225
01:39:42,234 --> 01:39:46,944
Tell me, if l employ a wet rag, would l
have to pay it as much as l pay you ?

1226
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:52,317
Hi.

1227
01:39:53,997 --> 01:39:56,073
Hello.

1228
01:39:56,166 --> 01:39:58,289
You disappeared.

1229
01:39:58,376 --> 01:40:00,999
Yeah. Yeah. Um--

1230
01:40:01,088 --> 01:40:04,920
l had to leave.
l didn't want to disturb.

1231
01:40:05,009 --> 01:40:09,007
- How have you been ?
- Fine, fine. Everything much the same.

1232
01:40:09,097 --> 01:40:13,177
When they change the law,
Spike and l will marry immediately.

1233
01:40:13,267 --> 01:40:16,304
Whereas you, l've watched in wonder.

1234
01:40:16,396 --> 01:40:18,603
- Awards, glory.
- Oh, no.

1235
01:40:18,691 --> 01:40:22,106
lt's-- lt's all nonsense, believe me.

1236
01:40:22,194 --> 01:40:25,148
l'd no idea how much nonsense
it was, but...

1237
01:40:25,239 --> 01:40:27,148
nonsense it all is.

1238
01:40:29,326 --> 01:40:31,782
Well, um--

1239
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:36,913
Yesterday was our last day of filming,
so... l'm leaving.

1240
01:40:39,045 --> 01:40:42,497
But, um--

1241
01:40:42,591 --> 01:40:46,209
l brought this for you from home,

1242
01:40:46,303 --> 01:40:48,509
so l thought l'd give it to you.

1243
01:40:49,974 --> 01:40:52,892
Thank you.

1244
01:40:52,977 --> 01:40:54,886
Shall l--

1245
01:40:54,979 --> 01:40:57,553
Oh, no, don't open it now.
l'll be embarrassed.

1246
01:41:00,401 --> 01:41:03,770
Well, thank you. l don't know
what it's for, but thanks anyway.

1247
01:41:03,863 --> 01:41:08,360
Actually, l had it in my apartment,
and l thought you'd--

1248
01:41:10,746 --> 01:41:13,533
But when it came to it,
l didn't know how to call,

1249
01:41:13,624 --> 01:41:16,708
having behaved so badly.

1250
01:41:16,794 --> 01:41:18,703
Twice.

1251
01:41:20,339 --> 01:41:24,468
So it's just been
sitting in the hotel.

1252
01:41:24,553 --> 01:41:28,882
Then you came and... l figured--

1253
01:41:32,561 --> 01:41:34,886
The thing is--

1254
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:36,889
The thing is--

1255
01:41:39,694 --> 01:41:42,564
What ? What is the thing ?

1256
01:41:43,823 --> 01:41:46,148
Don't even think about it.
Go away immediately.

1257
01:41:46,242 --> 01:41:48,863
- Go away.
- Right.

1258
01:41:48,953 --> 01:41:50,910
Sorry.

1259
01:41:53,166 --> 01:41:55,574
You were saying ?

1260
01:41:58,088 --> 01:42:01,540
Yes.

1261
01:42:01,634 --> 01:42:04,469
l have to go away today, but l...

1262
01:42:04,553 --> 01:42:07,839
wondered if l didn't...

1263
01:42:07,932 --> 01:42:12,310
whether you might
let me see you a little,

1264
01:42:12,395 --> 01:42:15,266
or... a lot, maybe.

1265
01:42:18,527 --> 01:42:21,397
See if you could like me again.

1266
01:42:21,488 --> 01:42:23,896
But yesterday
that actor asked you who l was,

1267
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:26,779
and you just
dismissed me out of hand.

1268
01:42:28,121 --> 01:42:31,205
l heard.

1269
01:42:31,290 --> 01:42:34,494
You had a microphone.
l had headphones.

1270
01:42:34,585 --> 01:42:36,543
You expect me
to tell the truth about my life...

1271
01:42:36,629 --> 01:42:39,251
to the most indiscreet man
in England ?

1272
01:42:40,675 --> 01:42:43,001
Uh, excuse me.

1273
01:42:43,095 --> 01:42:45,503
lt's your mother on the phone.

1274
01:42:48,309 --> 01:42:50,385
Will you tell her
l'll ring her back ?

1275
01:42:50,477 --> 01:42:53,562
l've actually tried that tack, but
she said you've said that once before,

1276
01:42:53,647 --> 01:42:55,604
and it's now been about 24 hours...

1277
01:42:55,691 --> 01:42:59,108
and the foot that was purple
is now sort of blackish in colour and--

1278
01:42:59,196 --> 01:43:02,980
Right, right. Yeah.
Perfect timing, as ever.

1279
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:07,912
Martin, hold the fort a second.

1280
01:43:07,996 --> 01:43:10,368
Uh, yes. All right.

1281
01:43:15,505 --> 01:43:18,043
Um, could l just say--

1282
01:43:18,132 --> 01:43:23,174
l thought Ghost
was the most wonderful film.

1283
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:27,100
- ls that right ?
- Oh, yes.

1284
01:43:30,311 --> 01:43:34,180
Um, l've always wondered...

1285
01:43:34,275 --> 01:43:37,441
what Patrick Swayze's like
in-- in-- in real life.

1286
01:43:37,528 --> 01:43:41,193
l can't say that l know Patrick
all that well.

1287
01:43:41,282 --> 01:43:43,523
He wasn't that friendly during filming ?

1288
01:43:43,617 --> 01:43:49,039
Well, l'm sure he was friendly to
Demi Moore who acted with him in Ghost.

1289
01:43:51,543 --> 01:43:53,868
Oh. Oh, right.

1290
01:43:53,962 --> 01:43:55,871
Sorry.

1291
01:43:57,549 --> 01:44:00,799
Always been a bit of an ass.

1292
01:44:00,886 --> 01:44:03,804
Um, anyway-- Um--

1293
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:05,799
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

1294
01:44:05,892 --> 01:44:08,299
l'm a huge, huge fan of yours.

1295
01:44:08,394 --> 01:44:12,059
And Demi's, of course.

1296
01:44:14,567 --> 01:44:16,774
Sorry.

1297
01:44:16,861 --> 01:44:18,688
That's fine.

1298
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:22,565
There's always a pause when the jury
goes out to consider their verdict.

1299
01:44:24,870 --> 01:44:27,990
Anna, look, um--

1300
01:44:28,082 --> 01:44:31,866
l'm a fairly levelheaded bloke,

1301
01:44:31,961 --> 01:44:35,829
not often in and out of love.

1302
01:44:35,924 --> 01:44:38,047
But, uh--

1303
01:44:42,597 --> 01:44:44,970
Can l just say no to your...

1304
01:44:45,058 --> 01:44:49,388
kind request and, uh, leave it at that ?

1305
01:44:52,775 --> 01:44:56,109
Yes.

1306
01:44:56,195 --> 01:44:59,695
Fine. Of course. l--

1307
01:44:59,782 --> 01:45:01,858
Of course.

1308
01:45:03,578 --> 01:45:06,614
l'll just be going, then.
lt was nice to see you.

1309
01:45:06,706 --> 01:45:09,625
The thing is,

1310
01:45:09,710 --> 01:45:13,161
with you l'm in real... danger.

1311
01:45:13,255 --> 01:45:16,422
lt seems like a... perfect situation,

1312
01:45:16,509 --> 01:45:19,960
apart from that
foul temper of yours, but...

1313
01:45:20,054 --> 01:45:24,598
my relatively inexperienced heart
would, l fear, not...

1314
01:45:24,684 --> 01:45:27,472
recover, uh, if l was...

1315
01:45:27,562 --> 01:45:31,607
once again cast aside,
as l would absolutely expect to be.

1316
01:45:31,692 --> 01:45:36,852
There are just too many pictures of you,
too many films.

1317
01:45:36,947 --> 01:45:40,281
You'd go and l'd be, uh,

1318
01:45:40,368 --> 01:45:42,989
well, buggered, basically.

1319
01:45:44,497 --> 01:45:47,415
That really is a real no, isn't it ?

1320
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:52,209
l live in Notting Hill.
You live in... Beverly Hills.

1321
01:45:52,297 --> 01:45:54,206
Everyone in the world
knows who you are.

1322
01:45:54,299 --> 01:45:58,000
My mother has trouble
remembering my name.

1323
01:45:58,095 --> 01:46:00,004
Fine.

1324
01:46:01,891 --> 01:46:06,220
Fine. Good decision.
Good decision.

1325
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:13,476
The fame thing isn't really real,
you know ?

1326
01:46:17,282 --> 01:46:20,900
And don't forget l'm--

1327
01:46:20,994 --> 01:46:24,778
l'm also just a girl...

1328
01:46:24,873 --> 01:46:29,002
standing in front of a boy...

1329
01:46:29,087 --> 01:46:31,660
asking him to love her.

1330
01:46:42,559 --> 01:46:44,468
Goodbye.

1331
01:47:06,877 --> 01:47:09,284
So what do you think ?
Good move ?

1332
01:47:09,379 --> 01:47:11,668
Yeah, good move.

1333
01:47:11,757 --> 01:47:14,426
l mean, when all's said and done,
she's nothing special.

1334
01:47:14,509 --> 01:47:16,419
l saw her taking her trousers down,

1335
01:47:16,511 --> 01:47:19,348
and l definitely glimpsed
some cellulite down there.

1336
01:47:19,432 --> 01:47:22,267
Good decision, yeah.

1337
01:47:22,352 --> 01:47:24,759
All actresses are as mad as snakes.

1338
01:47:24,854 --> 01:47:27,891
- Tones, what do you reckon ?
- Never met her, never want to.

1339
01:47:27,982 --> 01:47:31,683
- Brilliant. Max ?
- Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.

1340
01:47:31,778 --> 01:47:34,531
Great. Thanks. Brilliant.

1341
01:47:35,825 --> 01:47:38,363
l was called and l came. What's up ?

1342
01:47:38,452 --> 01:47:40,611
William's just turned down Anna Scott.

1343
01:47:42,248 --> 01:47:45,118
You daft prick.

1344
01:47:45,209 --> 01:47:48,625
No, no.
No, no, it's actually quite sensible.

1345
01:47:51,967 --> 01:47:55,715
That painting
isn't the original, is it ?

1346
01:47:55,804 --> 01:47:58,377
Um, you know,
l think it might be, yeah.

1347
01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:03,635
But she said
she wanted to go out with you.

1348
01:48:06,190 --> 01:48:09,145
- Yeah.
- Well, that's nice.

1349
01:48:10,695 --> 01:48:13,779
What ?

1350
01:48:13,865 --> 01:48:16,023
Well, you know,

1351
01:48:16,117 --> 01:48:20,245
anyone saying they wanna go out with you
is pretty great, isn't it ?

1352
01:48:26,003 --> 01:48:28,708
lt was...

1353
01:48:28,798 --> 01:48:31,039
sort of... sweet, actually.

1354
01:48:31,133 --> 01:48:34,051
Um, l mean,
l know she's an actress and all that...

1355
01:48:34,136 --> 01:48:40,010
so she can... deliver a line, but, um,

1356
01:48:40,102 --> 01:48:42,593
she said she might be
as famous as she can be,

1357
01:48:42,688 --> 01:48:45,558
but also that she was...

1358
01:48:45,649 --> 01:48:48,935
just a girl...

1359
01:48:49,027 --> 01:48:53,405
standing in front of a boy...

1360
01:48:53,490 --> 01:48:55,947
asking him... to love her.

1361
01:49:11,051 --> 01:49:14,503
Oh, sod a dog. l've made
the wrong decision, haven't l ?

1362
01:49:16,557 --> 01:49:18,384
Yeah.

1363
01:49:18,476 --> 01:49:21,679
Max, how fast is your car ?

1364
01:49:25,107 --> 01:49:28,892
- Good luck !
- lf anyone gets in our way,
we have small nuclear devices.

1365
01:49:28,987 --> 01:49:30,814
- Where to ?
- All l can think is The Ritz.

1366
01:49:30,906 --> 01:49:33,479
- Where's Bella ?
- She's not coming.

1367
01:49:33,575 --> 01:49:36,778
- Oh, sod that. Bernie, in the back.
- What ?

1368
01:49:39,414 --> 01:49:41,822
Max, l'm okay.

1369
01:49:41,917 --> 01:49:43,994
Come on, babe.

1370
01:49:52,053 --> 01:49:54,342
Which way are you going ?

1371
01:49:54,431 --> 01:49:57,597
Down Kensington Church Street, then
Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.

1372
01:49:57,684 --> 01:50:00,354
- No, crazy. Go along Bayswater.
- That's right. Then Park Lane.

1373
01:50:00,438 --> 01:50:02,477
No, straight down to the Cromwell Road,
then left.

1374
01:50:05,943 --> 01:50:09,608
Stop right there !
l will decide the route. All right ?

1375
01:50:09,697 --> 01:50:11,903
Sorry, Max.

1376
01:50:11,991 --> 01:50:14,909
James Bond never has to put up
with this sort of shit.

1377
01:50:22,002 --> 01:50:24,540
Turn right !

1378
01:50:24,630 --> 01:50:26,124
- l can't. lt's one way.
- Do a U-turn.

1379
01:50:26,215 --> 01:50:28,966
Oh, sod it. Hold on.

1380
01:50:34,849 --> 01:50:38,052
Brilliant !

1381
01:50:42,690 --> 01:50:46,106
Bloody hell, this is fun !

1382
01:50:46,194 --> 01:50:48,104
Sorry.

1383
01:50:48,197 --> 01:50:50,486
Hi.
ls Miss Scott staying here ?

1384
01:50:50,574 --> 01:50:53,943
- No, sir.
- How 'bout Miss Flintstone ?

1385
01:50:54,036 --> 01:50:57,073
- No, sir.
- Uh, Bambi ?

1386
01:50:57,164 --> 01:51:00,249
- No, sir.
- Or, um--

1387
01:51:00,334 --> 01:51:04,463
l don't know.
Beavis or Butthead ?

1388
01:51:04,548 --> 01:51:07,383
No, sir.

1389
01:51:07,467 --> 01:51:10,089
Thanks. Thanks.

1390
01:51:10,179 --> 01:51:12,800
There was a Miss Pocahontas,

1391
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:15,511
but she checked out
about an hour ago.

1392
01:51:15,601 --> 01:51:18,305
l believe she's holding
a press conference at the Savoy...

1393
01:51:18,395 --> 01:51:21,480
before flying to America.

1394
01:51:25,779 --> 01:51:27,688
We have liftoff.

1395
01:51:36,832 --> 01:51:38,790
You have message for Takiama ?

1396
01:51:38,876 --> 01:51:41,035
l'll just check, sir.

1397
01:52:04,194 --> 01:52:06,566
Bugger this for a bunch of bananas.

1398
01:52:10,869 --> 01:52:14,569
Stop ! Stop ! Stop !
Stay there ! Go ! Go !

1399
01:52:14,664 --> 01:52:17,914
Whoa, whoa, whoa ! Hang on !

1400
01:52:18,001 --> 01:52:21,002
Come on ! No ! Wait ! Wait there !

1401
01:52:21,087 --> 01:52:23,210
Come on ! Come on ! Wait !

1402
01:52:23,298 --> 01:52:26,466
Whoa, whoa, whoa ! Go on !
Through, through !

1403
01:52:28,095 --> 01:52:30,669
You're my hero !

1404
01:52:30,765 --> 01:52:32,674
Whoa ! Down, boy.

1405
01:52:52,412 --> 01:52:54,322
Excuse me.

1406
01:52:54,415 --> 01:52:57,037
- Yes ?
- Where's the press conference, please ?

1407
01:52:57,127 --> 01:53:00,293
- Are you an accredited
member of the press ?
- Yep.

1408
01:53:01,798 --> 01:53:06,259
- There you go.
- That's a Blockbuster Video
membership card, sir.

1409
01:53:06,344 --> 01:53:09,464
That's right.
l work for their in-house magazine.

1410
01:53:09,556 --> 01:53:11,798
- Movies Are Our Business.
- l'm sorry, sir.

1411
01:53:11,891 --> 01:53:14,383
- He's with me.
- And you are ?

1412
01:53:14,478 --> 01:53:18,808
Writing an article on how London hotels
treat people in wheelchairs.

1413
01:53:19,817 --> 01:53:22,937
Yes, of course, madam.
lt's in the Lancaster Room.

1414
01:53:23,029 --> 01:53:25,436
Though l'm afraid you're rather late.

1415
01:53:25,531 --> 01:53:27,488
Run !

1416
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:46,585
Does this mean that Miss Scott
will not be publicizing her next film ?

1417
01:53:46,679 --> 01:53:48,921
No, it absolutely
does not mean that.

1418
01:53:49,015 --> 01:53:51,174
She'll be abiding by
all her present commitments.

1419
01:53:51,267 --> 01:53:55,135
She just won't be making
any more for the next year.

1420
01:53:55,230 --> 01:53:57,306
When will the film be released ?

1421
01:53:57,399 --> 01:53:59,687
At the moment,
the plan is to release in America...

1422
01:53:59,776 --> 01:54:01,686
towards the end of the autumn,

1423
01:54:01,779 --> 01:54:05,113
and over here around Christmas
or early in the new year.

1424
01:54:05,199 --> 01:54:07,275
Right ! Dominic.

1425
01:54:07,368 --> 01:54:10,488
Anna, how much longer are you
staying in the U.K., then ?

1426
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:12,489
No time at all.
l leave tonight.

1427
01:54:12,582 --> 01:54:17,494
Which is why we have to round things
up now, so final questions, please.

1428
01:54:17,588 --> 01:54:19,296
Yes. Lady there.

1429
01:54:19,381 --> 01:54:22,216
ls your decision to take
a year off anything to do...

1430
01:54:22,301 --> 01:54:25,551
with the rumours about Jeff
and his present leading lady ?

1431
01:54:25,637 --> 01:54:29,053
- Absolutely not.
- Do you believe the rumours ?

1432
01:54:29,141 --> 01:54:32,974
Well, it's really
not my business any more.

1433
01:54:33,063 --> 01:54:37,890
Though l will say, from my experience,
rumours about Jeff do tend to be true.

1434
01:54:40,570 --> 01:54:44,568
Yeah. The last time you were here, there
were some fairly graphic photographs...

1435
01:54:44,658 --> 01:54:48,655
taken of you
with a young English guy.

1436
01:54:48,745 --> 01:54:51,866
So, uh, what happened there ?

1437
01:54:51,958 --> 01:54:55,327
He was just a friend.
We're still friends, l think.

1438
01:54:55,419 --> 01:54:58,670
Right, um--

1439
01:54:58,756 --> 01:55:01,128
Yes. Gentleman in the pink shirt.

1440
01:55:06,807 --> 01:55:11,350
Yes. Miss Scott,

1441
01:55:11,437 --> 01:55:13,844
are there any circumstances in which...

1442
01:55:13,939 --> 01:55:16,857
the two of you...

1443
01:55:16,942 --> 01:55:20,109
might be more than just good friends ?

1444
01:55:21,865 --> 01:55:26,610
l hoped there would be, but no,
l'm... assured there aren't.

1445
01:55:26,703 --> 01:55:30,238
- But what would you say if--
- Sorry. Just the one question, please.

1446
01:55:30,332 --> 01:55:32,953
No, it's all right.
You were saying ?

1447
01:55:34,669 --> 01:55:37,707
l was just wondering if, uh,

1448
01:55:37,798 --> 01:55:41,547
it turned out that this person, uh--

1449
01:55:41,636 --> 01:55:43,593
Thacker. His name was Thacker.

1450
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:45,802
Thanks, thanks.

1451
01:55:45,890 --> 01:55:48,559
l just wondered whether if...

1452
01:55:48,643 --> 01:55:52,593
Mr Thacker realized he'd been
a daft prick...

1453
01:55:55,025 --> 01:55:58,441
and got down on his knees and...
begged you to reconsider,

1454
01:55:58,529 --> 01:56:02,277
whether you would, in fact, then...

1455
01:56:02,366 --> 01:56:04,442
reconsider ?

1456
01:56:13,962 --> 01:56:17,129
Yes, l believe l would.

1457
01:56:19,342 --> 01:56:22,427
That's very good news.
Um--

1458
01:56:23,847 --> 01:56:27,299
The readers of Horse & Hound
will be absolutely delighted.

1459
01:56:34,192 --> 01:56:37,643
Right. Uh, Dominic, if you'd
like to ask your question again ?

1460
01:56:37,737 --> 01:56:43,159
Yeah ? Anna, how long are you
intending to stay here in Britain ?

1461
01:56:50,167 --> 01:56:51,709
lndefinitely.

1462
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:19,488
- What happened ?
- It was good.
