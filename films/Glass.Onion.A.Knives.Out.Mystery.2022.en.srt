1
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:29,625
No, subject to their approval — 
Ah, hold on.

2
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:32,625
- Hey. Oh, shit, sorry. Let me, uh…
- Uh, sign here.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,416
Can you grab the thing?
Oh my God, it's heavy.

4
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,833
- Have a good one.
- Thank you.

5
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,750
What's this?

6
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,958
I don't know.
I've got the CNN thing in like… now.

7
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,375
Amy, come on. Look alive.
Hold this, please.

8
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,208
On in ten. He's leading you in now.

9
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:49,666
Okay.

10
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,750
It's from Miles!

11
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,583
<i>And with me now is
Connecticut governor, Claire Debella,</i>

12
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>whose Senate campaign is picking up steam</i>

13
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,958
<i>as she has positioned herself
as a very different kind of candidate.</i>

14
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,291
<i>Governor, thanks for joining us.</i>

15
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:11,375
<i>Working from home
like the rest of us, I can see.</i>

16
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes. Welcome to our office,
campaign center, and kindergarten.

17
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,166
We are losing our minds.

18
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,500
<i>Your campaign is backed
by billionaire philanthropist, Miles Bron,</i>

19
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:25,000
<i>founder of the ubiquitous tech giant,
Alpha, which now has dozens of companies</i>

20
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:28,583
<i>from Alpha Cosmos
to Alpha Car, Alpha Shop…</i>

21
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:31,458
I know, I know, I know. But what can I do?

22
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,708
- <i>You can tell him no.</i>
- <i>How about no!</i>

23
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,750
<i> Lionel, you're a scientist,
not a publicist.</i>

24
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:36,666
<i>Exactly.</i>

25
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,875
<i>You can't keep making excuses</i>

26
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,000
<i>for every one
of Miles Bron's insane whims.</i>

27
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,541
Genius always looks like insanity
at first, though, right?

28
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:45,583
Isn't that how he became Miles Bron?
You guys have no idea.

29
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,000
The man faxes me
in the middle of the night.

30
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,208
He loves his faxes.

31
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,583
He sends me his ideas
that I'm supposed to<i>…</i>

32
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,833
You know what, you tell me.
Genius or insanity?

33
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,083
"Uber for biospheres."

34
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,333
I don't know. Okay. Maybe?

35
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,541
"AI in dogs equals discourse."

36
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,500
Okay? I mean, all night long,
they just keep<i>…</i>

37
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:07,708
But then…

38
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,791
Remember "child equals NFT"?

39
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,416
We all laughed,

40
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,750
but then the Crypto Kids app
paid for this building.

41
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,041
- Delivery.
- I mean, how do you argue with that?

42
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,750
- I wiped it down.
- <i>Yeah, we know.</i>

43
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,458
<i>Never bet against Bron, we know it.</i>

44
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:26,583
<i>But he's asking us to put
a volatile substance on a manned flight.</i>

45
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,500
He won't listen.
He just says, "Make it work."

46
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,541
And what if it works?

47
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,958
<i>This is science, not a religion.</i>

48
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,000
<i>Remember that, Lionel.</i>

49
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,958
<i>Because if your name is on this,
and it fails,</i>

50
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,125
<i>it will sink you forever.</i>

51
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,541
<i>I'm a hard line
on climate change.</i>

52
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,000
<i>If that scares you,
go stick your head back in the sand.</i>

53
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,083
<i>My constituents trust I'm gonna fight…</i>

54
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,583
I'm so bored.

55
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,416
Peg?

56
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,125
Peg?

57
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,875
Here! Here.

58
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,083
Hey, please stop fire-spinning inside.

59
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,708
Peg, please, I'm so bored.

60
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,500
No. No phones.

61
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,166
Why can't she have her phone?

62
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,458
'Cause she's mean.

63
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:29,541
No. Because she's afraid that I will tweet

64
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,958
an ethnic slur.

65
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:35,666
Again.

66
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,041
Yes. And you agreed no phone
for the rest of the media cycle.

67
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,875
I didn't even know that
that word referred to Jewish people.

68
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,250
I thought it was a generic term for cheap.

69
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,333
"Jewy"?

70
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,875
Everything is so woke these days,
it's out of control.

71
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:51,916
Yes.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,458
Love you. Yes.

73
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,500
And I say it like I see it, no filter.

74
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:00,250
If people can't handle it,
that's their problem. What's this?

75
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,958
Don't know.
Some guy just dropped it off.

76
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,750
All right, genius, what is this thing?

77
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,666
- Well…
- It's a Miles invitation.

78
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,541
Well, duh! But I mean, what is it?

79
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,000
- It's just like a block of wood.
- There's gotta be a way to open it.

80
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,541
It's solid.
There's no latches or even visible seams.

81
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,125
The wood-grain pattern's weird though.
It's like it's familiar.

82
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,625
- Hmm. Oh, wait. Hold on. It's Birdie.

83
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,208
Okay, how do you open this thing?

84
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,833
- Hi, Birdie. Lionel's on two. Hi, Peg!
- Hi!

85
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,125
Oh no. Peg's putting out a fire.
She'll be back.

86
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,416
Another fire? Bird.
What'd you say this time?

87
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,458
- No.
- You've got to stay off the Twitter.

88
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:41,166
It's nothing like that. It's fine.
Now, is this a Miles thing?

89
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,583
Have you figured out
how to open it, Lionel?

90
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,583
Lionel, use your science brain.

91
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,666
I'm working on it.
Bird, should you really be having a party?

92
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,166
No, they're all in my pod. It's fine.
Has anyone heard from Duke?

93
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,333
- No.
- No.

94
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,250
So this has gotten
some attention recently,

95
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,458
so obviously
I would like to speak to this,

96
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,791
and the answer is no, Jimmy Kimmel,

97
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,500
I do not hate boobs.

98
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,958
Boobs give us many useful things.
Boobs give us milk, cheese.

99
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,375
Breasts nourish our young until the age
where we can go out and hunt for them.

100
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,250
Let's be honest. Boobs are fun.

101
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,041
There's nothing wrong with that,
right, babe?

102
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,750
I love my boobs. They're so much fun.

103
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,166
- Oops! Sorry, feminists!
- Sorry, feminists.

104
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,166
So when we're talking
about the breast-ification of America…

105
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,208
I mean, what that means
is a breakdown in the natural order.

106
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,500
Evolutionary truths
that go back billions of years.

107
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,625
So when you're asking
a young man in America

108
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,791
to slow down so a woman can catch up…

109
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:37,708
Duke!

110
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:42,166
For centuries, the Western workplace
has been dominated by men 'cause…

111
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,416
- Dukey!
- …that's what nature made us to do.

112
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,541
Dukey! I've been calling you.
You gotta answer me when I call!

113
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,791
Mom! Will you shut it?
We've been over this a million times.

114
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,250
I told you. When me and Whiskey are live,
you gotta let us — 

115
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,708
You tell your mother to shut up?

116
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,625
- Sorry. It's just when we're live — 
- What?

117
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,250
- When we're — 
- What?

118
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,750
Jeez, Mom. I'm sorry.

119
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,708
You got a delivery. It's in the kitchen.

120
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,583
Maybe it's sensitive to heat.

121
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,583
- Wait. It's Duke. Hold on.

122
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,875
- Duke!
- <i>Hey, what is this thing?</i>

123
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,625
- My mom already broke it.
- It's a stereogram.

124
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,708
<i>She did something to it. It opened up.
I don't know. She broke it.</i>

125
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:23,916
A stereogram!

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,208
<i>A what-a-gram?</i>

127
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,000
<i>Wait, a stereogram!
Were those the things — </i>

128
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,625
<i>Magic eye things?
I could never do those.</i>

129
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,500
<i>Ma! What did I tell you
about touching my stuff?</i>

130
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,875
Do you group them by color maybe or…

131
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,833
Size? Weight? Should I weigh them?

132
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:52,208
Eight by eight. It's a chessboard.
This is a chess endgame.

133
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,708
So it's… It's set up
for a mate in one. Should I — 

134
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,291
Do it, Kasparov.

135
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,541
That's tic-tac-toe! I know this!

136
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,500
- But it's solved already, so it can't be.
- It's tic-tac-toe.

137
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,375
But thank you
for contributing, Birdie. Yes.

138
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,791
Wait, wait.
The tapper thing is for Morse code.

139
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,958
The X's and O's are dots and dashes.

140
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,416
Dit's and Da's!

141
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,375
- So that's… Yep.
- Oh, wow.

142
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,458
O-U-R. Here.

143
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,625
It's tic-tac-toe.

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,833
<i>Is something supposed to happen?</i>

145
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,750
<i>"N." Maybe it stands for something,</i>

146
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,208
<i>maybe in one of the other puzzles?</i>

147
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,250
It's a compass.

148
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,583
- Ma!
- It's a compass!

149
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,166
Okay, north, south…

150
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,916
Okay, N is for north,
so turn it due north.

151
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,708
- It's music. Guys, it's music!
- Shh!

152
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,958
- Are you mocking me?
- Yes.

153
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:55,541
Okay, ha-ha, I'm gonna Shazam it.

154
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,750
What is that?

155
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:02,208
Alexa, Shazam this song please.
Alexa, Shazam this song please.

156
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,791
Hey, this is Bach's <i>Little Fugue</i>
in G Minor.

157
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,416
- You sure?
- Yeah.

158
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,541
Uh, I'm Shazam-ing it.
Alexa, Shazam this song please.

159
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:14,750
So a fugue is a beautiful
musical puzzle based on just one tune.

160
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,250
<i>And when you layer this tune
on top of itself,</i>

161
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:22,416
it starts to change
and turns into a beautiful new structure.

162
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,583
This can't Shazam. It's a lamp.

163
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,208
- I love you, Birdie.
- I love you too, Claire.

164
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,708
Wait. "La-la-layered back over itself."
Hold on.

165
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,166
See this center wheel? Lift it up.

166
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,208
A whole new tune.

167
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,125
Freaking Miles, man. Genius.

168
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,666
That first one's
a Fibonacci sequence.

169
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,625
Ma!

170
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,666
No, get your hand off of that.

171
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,833
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

172
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,125
Forty-seven for sure?

173
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,291
That's the atomic number for silver.

174
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,875
- Are you —  Are you sure that's silver?
- That's silver.

175
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,500
So this is it.

176
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:14,250
All together now. One, two, three.

177
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,625
Look at that.

178
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,166
"My dear friends, my beautiful disruptors,
my closest inner circle…"

179
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,833
"…we could use a moment of normalcy.
And so you are cordially invited…"

180
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,250
"…for a long weekend
on my private island…"

181
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,916
"…where we will celebrate the bonds
that connect us,

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,500
and I hope your
puzzle-solving skills are whetted."

183
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,958
"Because you will also be competing
to solve the mystery…"

184
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,041
Whoo!

185
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,750
"…of my murder."

186
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,291
"Travel details to come.
Please forward any dietary restrictions."

187
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,083
"Love and all my kisses, Miles."

188
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,750
Ma! Where's my speargun?
I gotta pack. Babe, get packing!

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,708
What's that?

190
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:13,708
I don't know.

191
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,083
Whoo!

192
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,500
Wait… Hold on.

193
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,958
What just happened?

194
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,375
<i>Blanc. I saw you go in the engine room.</i>

195
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,458
<i>You're the Imposter. We all know it.</i>

196
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,541
<i>Case closed. We're done.</i>

197
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,916
I don't understand this at all.

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,375
So Angie caught me,
and now the game's just over?

199
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,666
<i>Sorry, Blanc,
you're thrown out of the airlock.</i>

200
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,791
<i>It's a no-brainer.</i>

201
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:56,708
<i>I've got to say,</i>

202
00:11:56,791 --> 00:12:00,125
<i>the world's greatest detective…
I thought you'd be better at this.</i>

203
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,250
I think maybe
this game's just not my thing.

204
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,583
<i>Maybe we should try</i> Quiplash.

205
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,375
<i>Uh, or</i> Codenames.

206
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,125
No. No, I…

207
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:13,250
Look, I appreciate
what y'all are trying to do for me here.

208
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,458
<i>We're worried about you, buddy.
Lockdown hasn't been easy for any of us.</i>

209
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,541
<i>But Phillip told me you haven't
left the bath for a week.</i>

210
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,708
Oh, that's hyperbole.

211
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,291
Get that, would ya?

212
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,083
You're not in the bath again,
are you?

213
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,958
No!

214
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,750
I'm just…

215
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,875
I lose it between cases anyway.

216
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,833
I think I might be going insane.

217
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:44,541
My mind is a fueled-up racing car,
and I got nowhere to drive it.

218
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,083
<i>Hey, can I ask…
Have you tried crosswords?</i>

219
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,583
No, no, Natasha.

220
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:53,083
I… I don't need puzzles or games.
The last thing I need is a vacation.

221
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,791
I need danger, a hunt, a challenge.

222
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:02,166
I need… a great case.

223
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,125
Blanc?
There's someone here for you!

224
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,041
With a box!

225
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,416
Whoo.

226
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,916
Claire, my dear!

227
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,458
Hi, you genius!

228
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,625
Whoo-hoo!

229
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,875
Hello! Oh my God!

230
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,958
- We can't hug, right?
- No!

231
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,083
- I mean, can we?
- Hi, Peg!

232
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,750
- I wanna hug everybody.
- Elbows!

233
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,500
- You need help?
- Yes, please!

234
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,083
Did you two stay at the hotel last night?
I didn't see you.

235
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,375
No, Birdie,
we clearly just arrived.

236
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:26,375
But you… Hello, stranger danger.

237
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,541
Mr. Blanc! You are stranger danger?

238
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:33,333
No, that's fine, Nikos.
I don't even know what that means.

239
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,250
Wait a second. Benoit Blanc?

240
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:40,500
Oh my God.
Are you Benoit Blanc, the detective?

241
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,916
Did you solve the murder of…
Ah, what's her name?

242
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,333
That… The ballet dancer
with the thing and the thing. That's you?

243
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,458
It is, in the flesh.

244
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,833
I'm obviously familiar
with you all as well.

245
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:56,125
Governor. Dr. Toussaint. Miss Birdie Jay.

246
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,041
What an extraordinary gathering.

247
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,333
Whoo-hoo!

248
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,500
Crew! We've arrived.

249
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,708
Disruptors have assembled!

250
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,000
- No, no, absolutely not.
- Duke!

251
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,791
- The Duke.
- Duke, hello.

252
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,833
Hey, guys.

253
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,750
- Remember my girl, Whiskey?
- Hi.

254
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,458
Of course, Whiskey. Hello.

255
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,333
Who's that?

256
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,333
Why are you in Greece, Mr. Blanc?

257
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,208
I was invited by Miles Bron.

258
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:39,750
Tight with Miles?

259
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,166
No, never met.

260
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,916
Oh, I get it.
The, uh… The murder mystery thing.

261
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,666
Benoit Blanc is going to help solve
the mystery of Miles' murder.

262
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,416
- This should be fun.
- Cute.

263
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,000
Well, we'll see.

264
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,833
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Greece.

265
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,166
This fine craft will take you
to Mr. Bron's island.

266
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,583
It is a two-hour journey.

267
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:16,916
Your captain, Mr. Andino,
will assist you with your luggage.

268
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,958
But first, I'm gonna need you
to remove your masks

269
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,208
and extend your tongue.

270
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,250
This will only be
momentarily uncomfortable.

271
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,458
Mr. Cody.

272
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,875
No pineapple in that, right?
Duke don't dance with pineapple.

273
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,166
There's no pineapple.

274
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,958
Well, it seems
I'm the odd man out, Governor.

275
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,416
You're all friends.

276
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,916
Miles does one
of these weekend reunions every year.

277
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Some… nutso invitation.
Some extravagant trip.

278
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,250
Just a little…
 …menagerie.

279
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,125
Excuse me,
I love your accent. I had to try it. Oh.

280
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,833
Oh!

281
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,333
Eight years of doing these trips,

282
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,916
you're the first new person
he's ever invited.

283
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,500
- You must be very special.
- Oh! Oh, well…

284
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,958
What is this material? I love it.

285
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,791
- Cotton, I think.
- Sir.

286
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,083
Uh…

287
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,166
What is that?

288
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,333
Open, please.

289
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,916
You won't be needing that anymore.

290
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,458
- I won't?
- You're good.

291
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,750
What is that?
Is that some kind of disinfectant or…

292
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,500
You're good. Have a great trip, everyone.

293
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,666
Andi! Hi!

294
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,875
Holy shit.

295
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,125
I could not help but notice
the stir at her arrival.

296
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,166
Yeah. That was a stir.

297
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,083
She's not in your little gang?

298
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,875
She was —  She is.

299
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:43,291
Andi started Alpha with Miles
ten years ago, just the two of them.

300
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,958
That's Cassandra Brand?

301
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,250
Andi, yeah.

302
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,708
And they're no longer partners?

303
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,000
In one legal move,
he cut her out completely.

304
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,125
Booted her without a dime,
<i>Social Network'd</i> her.

305
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:59,375
Lord. But he still invited her
to this weekend?

306
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,208
The question isn't,
"Why did he invite her?"

307
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,791
It's, "Why did she show up?"

308
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,666
Is that dock a Banksy?

309
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,833
Pisceshite.

310
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,708
Oh, is that the name of
the island in Greek?

311
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,708
Pisceshite.

312
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,416
Pisceshite. Pisceshite.

313
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,833
Miles!

314
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,208
Oh, my baby, Birdie!

315
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,416
Oh, with your island!

316
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,000
- Serenading me with my song!
- On the guitar Paul wrote it on.

317
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,416
I know, legit, right?

318
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,625
But look at your face.
It was worth it. Oh!

319
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,625
My friends, my friends,
oh, my old friends.

320
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,083
Are we allowed to hug
after the whole Men in Black thing?

321
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:16,333
- We can hug. Okay.
- Oh, God, bring it in.

322
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,750
- Oh! We're allowed to hug.
- Ah. Aw.

323
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,708
Duke!

324
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,958
Hey, buddy. This is a dream.

325
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,583
Not a dream, wide awake.
And it feels so good.

326
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,541
Whiskey.

327
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,083
Wow. I just… I love that necklace.

328
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,916
- Great. Come on, bring it in.
- This old thing?

329
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,041
- How you doing?
- I'm so good.

330
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,166
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm. Great island.

331
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,916
Greek island, huh? Sexy, right?

332
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,333
So, uh, Benoit Blanc, huh?

333
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,583
Hmm?

334
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,375
Man, when you throw
a murder mystery party,

335
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,541
you do it right, buddy.

336
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,458
Dukey.

337
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,708
- My man.
- Hey, pal.

338
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,166
- Good to see you.
- You too, buddy.

339
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,166
Hello.

340
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,958
Mr. Bron, I cannot overstate
my gratitude for this, I — 

341
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,000
So happy to meet — 

342
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:09,958
Andi.

343
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:12,541
You're here.

344
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,416
I am.

345
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,291
All right,
when's the murder mystery start?

346
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,291
My man, patience. Patience.

347
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,125
Okay, look,
I know you guys think I'm a hippie,

348
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,166
but can we just take a second

349
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,166
and fully inbreathiate
this moment together?

350
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,458
Mmm.

351
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,125
We're old friends. We're still friends.

352
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:36,958
And I love you all.

353
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,041
I just wanted to say that.

354
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:43,625
But we got a great weekend,
just our gang, just us.

355
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:44,750
Hey, hey!

356
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,916
Hey, bro.

357
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,541
I'm not here.

358
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,500
Who's that?

359
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,541
That's Derol. He's just staying here.
He's going through things,

360
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,875
but he's not part of
the experience at all, okay?

361
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:01,625
So first,
a proper tour of the Glass Onion.

362
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,625
- Here we go.
- Oh my God.

363
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:07,625
The Glass Onion, like our bar!
Oh, I loved that baby so much.

364
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,458
Should we, um, get our bags, um…

365
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,000
Sun is blinding.

366
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,833
…or someone will get them for us. Okay.

367
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,041
I could use a second
in the shade.

368
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,958
- This rich- people shit is weird.
- Thank you.

369
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:23,208
I… I have occasionally
put on the dog in my life, but this…

370
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,916
This is stretching
my stride-taking abilities.

371
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,041
You're doing great. I'm Andi.

372
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,750
That is very genial of you. I'm Benoit.

373
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,750
- You got a flat tire there.
- Thank you.

374
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,666
Oh, wow. Okay.

375
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,041
Wow!

376
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,833
It's like an actual huge glass onion.

377
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:47,291
- Yep.
- It's past, present and future.

378
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:51,708
It's what came before, where I am now,
what I'll leave to the world.

379
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:52,708
Ignore me.

380
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:55,958
This is the full reclamation of everything
I've achieved up to now — 

381
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,041
So, what kind of staff does it take
to run a place like this?

382
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:02,875
Normally like 50, but, you know…
Look, I sent everyone home.

383
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:06,125
I just wanna have a normal weekend
with my old friends like the old days.

384
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,541
Right? See, look, that's the thing.

385
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,791
This isn't just
a rich-asshole house. It's…

386
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,833
I mean, it's not even a house.

387
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:17,041
It's a… It's a commune. For creativity.

388
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,583
Oh, amazing.

389
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:22,625
<i>Dong!</i>

390
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:23,833
What is that?

391
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:27,916
That's the hourly dong.
You know I got Phil Glass to compose that?

392
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,291
- What?
- Who's Phil Gas?

393
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,583
Okay, let's stop talking and actually
start hanging out and having fun.

394
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,791
Your rooms are assigned by the chakra

395
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,083
that I most closely associate
with each of you.

396
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,083
I know. Go with it, okay?

397
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,583
Your biorhythm monitor
is the key to your room.

398
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,291
- It'll lead you to the room using haptics.
- Oh my God.

399
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,291
Get settled in, change.
Let's meet up at the pool.

400
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,958
We'll have a chill afternoon.
And then the game begins.

401
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,375
Ooh.

402
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:56,208
Sacral! You know me, Miles.

403
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,083
Oh, Miles.

404
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,750
- Ooh.
- Hey, Andi…

405
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,791
- Sacral!
- I…

406
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,333
I really am glad you're here.

407
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:16,125
Wow. I… I'm sorry, but that is just crazy.

408
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,000
- I know. Hey, Mr. Blanc.
- Hmm?

409
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,500
- Could we have a quick word?
- Mmm, of course.

410
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:38,000
Oh my word. This…

411
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,625
Oh my goodness, me. This is…

412
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,958
That is<i>… </i>Wait, what is that?

413
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:45,375
Oh my God, it's full of stars!

414
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:48,250
2010, the year we made contact, that's…

415
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:51,541
Um, this is amazing, just amazing.

416
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,875
I… I'm so happy to be here under…

417
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:57,500
If there's any role you'd like me to play
in this murder mystery game

418
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:02,250
as the… I don't know, detective,
I'd be more than happy to oblige.

419
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:06,125
Just to be included and to… To meet you…

420
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,166
Is that a motorcar?

421
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:12,458
Oh, yeah. That's my Baby Blue.

422
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:16,000
It's one-of-a-kind. Goes anywhere I go.
All around the world.

423
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,541
Why is it on the roof?

424
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,083
'Cause there's nowhere to drive it
on the island.

425
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:25,208
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

426
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,791
Mr. Blanc, uh…

427
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,375
I wanted to ask,

428
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,125
what are you doing here?

429
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:33,166
I'm sorry?

430
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,541
What are you doing here?

431
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,000
Uh, you invited me.

432
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:40,750
No, I didn't.

433
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:42,458
What…

434
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:46,500
You sent me a box.

435
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,083
- Wait, you received a box?
- Yes.

436
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:55,541
The wooden box was delivered to my home
with some simple children's puzzles

437
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:59,083
which, once I completed them,
there was an invitation inside.

438
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,541
Do you have that invitation?

439
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,166
Well, yes, I do.

440
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,666
I'm sorry. I'm… I'm very confused.

441
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,708
Is this part of the game?

442
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:09,791
No.

443
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,833
This is just like the other ones,
but I didn't send it to you.

444
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,625
How many of these boxes did you create?

445
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:25,291
- Five. One for each of my friends.
- No test boxes? No prototypes?

446
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,750
No, my puzzle guy barely got the five done
in time,

447
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,250
and he apprenticed with Ricky Jay.

448
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:32,125
And once the boxes are open
and the puzzles completed,

449
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:35,083
is there any way to close them again?
To… To reset 'em?

450
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,875
Hang on. Hang on.

451
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,875
Someone reset the box.

452
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:46,833
Someone reset the box.
They sent it to you as a gag.

453
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:51,416
"Miles is doing a murder mystery.
Let's invite Benoit freaking Blanc."

454
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:53,791
It's so good.

455
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:57,208
I am mortified. I don't — 

456
00:26:57,291 --> 00:27:01,500
Why? I've got the predefinite detective
in the world at my murder mystery party.

457
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,250
That is so legit.

458
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:07,166
Mr. Bron, I've learned
through bitter experience

459
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,666
that an anonymous invitation
is not to be trifled with.

460
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,125
Okay, look, come on.
I'd love to have you visit me in my home.

461
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,375
There, you've been invited.
You're an official guest now.

462
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:22,083
Thrilled to have you.
I mean, relax. Enjoy yourself.

463
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:25,958
Hey, try to solve
the murder mystery if you can.

464
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:29,333
I don't want to toot my own horn,
but it's pretty next level.

465
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,833
I'm gonna foil. See you at the pool.

466
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:55,375
Lionel, you are too sexy
to be a scientist.

467
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:59,083
And, Claire… you look so cute.

468
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:00,458
Aw, thanks, Bird.

469
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:03,333
You really try. I like that.
You really make an effort.

470
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:05,416
Well, I figured, Greece.

471
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:08,333
And no masks, I can breathe again.

472
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:11,500
Look at this pool.
I think I'll go for a swim.

473
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,458
Maybe I'll lay out for a bit.

474
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,791
AK and Flea get all the credit,

475
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:29,666
but Frusciante really
is the heart of the Chili Peppers.

476
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,000
- Hey, Blanc! Have a dip.
- Hey.

477
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,166
Grab a hard kombucha.
They're actually pretty good.

478
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,666
Jared Leto sent 'em over.
I think he wants me to invest.

479
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,916
- Well, I am on vacation, so…
- Hey, booch me!

480
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,083
There you go.

481
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,083
Yeah.

482
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,541
Oh! The Baby Blue!

483
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:43,541
Iconic.

484
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:46,416
Remember that night you almost pancaked me
with it on the road outside — 

485
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,041
Anderson Cooper's birthday.

486
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:51,916
Coop's parties are memorable.

487
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,000
- <i>Dong!</i>
- Yep!

488
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:00,375
Oh, God.

489
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,583
Really, Duke?

490
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,333
Oh my God!

491
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:05,291
Really.

492
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:06,208
Asshole.

493
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:09,083
Now it's a party.

494
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,291
That is quite a piece.

495
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,875
- Never without it.
- Mmm.

496
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,291
- So I see.
- You never know when shit's gonna go down.

497
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,333
Ah…

498
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,375
Birdie. You have to tell him.

499
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:32,083
- You gotta tell him.
- I will.

500
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:33,708
- I'm serious. You gotta — 
- I will.

501
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:35,166
- I will.
- You just gotta go beg.

502
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,250
- Okay?
- Oh, God.

503
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:39,000
When he goes to his room,
just follow him and then do it.

504
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:41,416
I will take care of him. Don't worry.

505
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,958
Cool me off. Gimme a sip of that.

506
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:46,750
- I'm hot for both — 
- That's so hot.

507
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,625
There was a time, you know, back when…

508
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:57,250
I was the one on magazines. He was nobody.

509
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,458
He couldn't believe
he was even talking to me.

510
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
He said that to me.

511
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:09,333
"You're Birdie Jay, on billboards.
I can't believe I'm talking to you."

512
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:13,625
He was this little thing in my hand.

513
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:18,916
I preferred that.

514
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:33,458
Andi! Hi! Wow.

515
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:35,333
How long has it been?

516
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,583
Since the trial. So a few months.

517
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:41,583
Mmm, the trial, ugh. That was not fun.

518
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:45,791
I mean, for all of us.
For anybody. Right, Peg?

519
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:49,000
Right? I'm uncomfortable.
I'm gonna go for a swim.

520
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,541
Now, I can handle
the Matisse in the bathroom,

521
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:59,833
but is, uh… Is that a fax machine?

522
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:03,541
Miles doesn't even have a phone.

523
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:05,875
It's really convenient. I have one number,

524
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:08,291
goes to all my fax machines
all over the world.

525
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,625
There's something about analog that's — 

526
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:13,791
Oh! Look at this blast from my past.

527
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,750
- Look, everybody. Look.

528
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,166
Miles, you're so funny,
having this around.

529
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,583
May I ask,
if it isn't too presumptuous of me,

530
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:23,541
what first drew you all together?

531
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,583
You're such an eclectic bunch.

532
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:29,375
I think disruptors recognize each other.

533
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:30,291
Yes.

534
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:33,250
Now you've used
that word before, "disruptors."

535
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,583
What does that mean?

536
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:36,541
Some people think
Birdie's disruptive

537
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:38,125
every time she opens her mouth.

538
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:40,958
I mean, just because she says
what everyone's thinking,

539
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:43,000
but no one's got the nerve to say.

540
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,916
It's true. I say it like I see it.

541
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,166
No. But seriously, you know about
Sweetie Pants, right?

542
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,541
I'm going to embarrass myself here.

543
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:54,791
I adore Sweetie Pants. I live in mine — 

544
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:58,333
You're sitting next to Birdie Jay.
She was a fashion icon.

545
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,500
And then the youngest editor ever
of <i>She She Magazine.</i> Right?

546
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:05,541
Establishment BS,
on top of the world, but then…

547
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:07,791
Well…

548
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:11,291
Then there was the whole thing
with the Halloween costume.

549
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:12,208
Oh.

550
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:16,125
It was a tribute to Beyoncé,
but people did not take it that way.

551
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:18,875
- Anyway, I had a lot of time at home.
- Mm-hmm.

552
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:21,625
- I just spent all my time in my — 
- Oh, in sweatpants.

553
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:25,708
She comes out with designer,
high quality, comfortable sweatpants

554
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:27,375
just as a pandemic hits.

555
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:30,583
She disrupted her own disruption.
She made a killing.

556
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:33,833
And look at Duke.
You think people looked at him

557
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:35,375
and saw anything other than the beef?

558
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:39,791
You think they saw the first influencer
to have a million followers on Twitch?

559
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,583
Yes, I did. Here it is.
Deal with it.

560
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:44,125
- Hello.
- What about Claire?

561
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:48,458
You know, soccer mom in beige
throwing grenades into machine politics.

562
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:52,583
Lionel, he didn't wait ten years
licking on the taint of academia

563
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:55,291
to get permission to start pushing
the boundaries of science.

564
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:58,833
He just did it.
That's what I did with Al — 

565
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:04,541
That's what <i>we</i> did with Alpha.
Disrupt. See…

566
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,541
Tell you a little secret.
Your worldview's gonna change.

567
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:14,083
Once you hear it, you can't unhear it.
Is your phone turned off?

568
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:16,583
- Oh, I left it in my room.
- Okay.

569
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:22,208
If you want to shake things up,
you start with something small.

570
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,791
You break a norm,
or an idea, or a convention,

571
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:25,958
some little business model.

572
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:29,458
But you go with things
that people are kind of tired of anyway.

573
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:32,666
Everybody gets excited
because you're busting up something

574
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,833
that everyone wanted broken
in the first place.

575
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:39,000
That's the infraction point.

576
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,625
That's the place
where you have to look within yourself

577
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:46,666
and ask, "Am I the kind of person
who will keep going?"

578
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:49,333
Will you break more things?

579
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:51,958
Break bigger things?

580
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:56,916
Are you willing to break <i>the</i> thing
that nobody wants you to break?

581
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:01,750
Because at that point,
people are not gonna be on your side.

582
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,833
They're gonna call you crazy.

583
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:07,125
They're gonna say you're a bully.
They're gonna tell you to stop.

584
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,416
Even your partner will say,
"You need to stop."

585
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,916
Because as it turns out,

586
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:18,958
nobody wants you to break
the system itself.

587
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:23,375
But that is what true disruption is.

588
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,041
And that is what unites all of us.

589
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:32,750
We all got to that line and crossed it.

590
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,416
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

591
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,041
- See?
- Yeah, yeah.

592
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,541
So, disruptors.

593
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:40,708
All of us.

594
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:47,375
Wow.

595
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:48,291
Mmm!

596
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:51,291
That was some real red-pill stuff, Miles.

597
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:55,333
The Andi I built Alpha with?
She believed it.

598
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:56,750
Oh, I believed it.

599
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:59,250
I believed it.

600
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:02,416
Mr. Blanc, you're a detective, right?

601
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,750
Yes, I'm…

602
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:06,541
Can you spot the other thing?

603
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,416
The real thing this group has in common?

604
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,833
Andi, come on.

605
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:14,625
Oh, Lionel.
Everybody knows who Lionel works for.

606
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:15,958
That's no secret.

607
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,708
And we know
who bankrolled Claire's campaign.

608
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:24,083
But when nobody…

609
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,791
Nobody would touch Birdie
with a ten-foot pole

610
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:31,291
because she went on <i>Oprah</i>
and compared herself to Harriet Tubman…

611
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,458
In spirit! Oh, God.

612
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:34,625
…who do you think showed up

613
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:37,208
as an angel investor
in Sweetie Pants? Huh?

614
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:39,416
And Duke.

615
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,166
When Duke got banned from Twitch

616
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,583
for hawking rhino-horn boner pills
to teenage boys…

617
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:45,250
There was zero rhino in those pills.

618
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,125
…who set him up at YouTube

619
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:49,875
and used their media empire
to promote the stream?

620
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,583
That is the common thread here.

621
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:56,083
Every single one of you
is holding on for dear life

622
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:58,083
to Miles Bron's golden titties.

623
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:00,416
And each of you,

624
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:04,208
you'll stab a friend in the back
to hold on.

625
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,958
That is what I believe.

626
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:27,000
Andi, wait.

627
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:29,541
Wow.

628
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:32,125
That was so real.

629
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:36,541
Anyway, dinner's at 8:00.

630
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,000
See you all there? Yeah.

631
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,625
Like Miles said,

632
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:48,541
I'm a truth-teller.
Some people can't handle it.

633
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,625
It's a dangerous thing
to mistake speaking without thought

634
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:55,000
for speaking the truth.

635
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,375
Don't you think?

636
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,500
Are you calling me dangerous?

637
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:03,875
Well, we'll see.

638
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,250
If you'll excuse me.

639
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:19,250
Something's off.

640
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:21,041
What do you mean?

641
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,208
She's changed.

642
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:25,750
What's she playing at?

643
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:29,041
Mr. Bron! Wait!

644
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,750
Hey, hi.

645
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,583
- Hello.
- Uh…

646
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:39,041
- Please don't do this.
- Sorry?

647
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,166
Bird showed me the statement you want her
to make to the press about Bangladesh,

648
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,833
and if you make her go through with it,
her name is…

649
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,541
destroyed.

650
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:53,875
But you see, my resume
is just Birdie Jay, Birdie Jay,

651
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:56,125
a short stint in retail,
and then Birdie Jay.

652
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:59,333
So if her name is destroyed,
then my name is…

653
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:02,625
I… I'm sorry…

654
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,708
It's Peg.

655
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:12,291
I'm begging you.
You gotta get her to make that statement.

656
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,375
It is her only way out.

657
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:19,333
- What — 
- Okay, good.

658
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:21,291
But, uh…

659
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:32,625
<i>Dong!</i>

660
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:00,625
<i>This is a smokeless garden.</i>

661
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:04,208
<i>This is a smokeless garden.
This is a smokeless garden.</i>

662
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:07,416
<i>Please, keep our water clean.</i>

663
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,125
<i>Please, keep our water clean.
Please, keep our water clean.</i>

664
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,916
Are you gonna do it for me?

665
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,750
Mm-hmm.

666
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:07,708
Wow!

667
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:27,416
Welcome, gang.
A few cocktails before I'm murdered.

668
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,666
I think I remember everyone's favorite.

669
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,333
And we got tamales.

670
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:33,541
My chemist.

671
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:38,166
- Mmm, Lagavulin 16.
- He likes it heavy on the peat.

672
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,375
Serve it up neat.

673
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,500
Is this my Cuban Breeze?

674
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:44,666
The drink that got us on the no-fly list
at St. Barts. What else?

675
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,166
Well, #WorthIt.

676
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:48,041
- Claire-bear.
- Hmm?

677
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:49,958
- Room temp white.
- Pinot Gris.

678
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:54,458
Halle Berry! That has a kick.

679
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:56,708
Oh, that's Jeremy Renner's
small-batch hot sauce.

680
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:01,041
I let him invest. He sends me
a pallet every year. Take a few bottles.

681
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,625
Well…  …thank you.

682
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:06,458
I apologize. I don't know your drink,
but, you know, pick your poison.

683
00:41:06,541 --> 00:41:07,583
Hey, Andi.

684
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:13,666
I'm hoping it's still whiskey soda.

685
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:19,416
- You know I — 
- Okay. Miles.

686
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,750
I mean,
I know you have a thing for it, but…

687
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:25,875
I mean, this place is the Tate Modern!

688
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:30,583
Why would you hang a framed print
of the <i>Mona Lisa</i> front and center?

689
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:33,041
It's like having a Che poster
in your dorm room.

690
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,875
Mm-hmm.

691
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:35,791
Or…

692
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:39,458
Come on.

693
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:41,750
Wait.

694
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,833
- That's impossible, Miles.
- Mm-hmm.

695
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:47,666
Forgive my incredulity, but surely…
No, the <i>Mona Lisa,</i>

696
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,291
that's property of the state.
There's no way — 

697
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:51,750
Blame it on the pando, Blanc.

698
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:55,291
The Louvre was closed,
France needed money,

699
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:58,000
and so I bought myself
a little short-term loan.

700
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:01,416
It turns out the transport
and the security was most of the cost.

701
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,375
Check this out.

702
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,916
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

703
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:08,833
Don't tell the insurance guys,

704
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:11,500
but I had
a little override button installed.

705
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,541
- Oh, you did.
- Where do you think it is?

706
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,125
Oh, my gosh! It's easy.

707
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:19,583
It's so freaking sensitive.

708
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:21,500
A phone dings, it closes up.
It's ridiculous,

709
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:25,791
but I needed to be able to look her
in the eyes without glass in between us.

710
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,208
My mom took me to Paris
when I was six years old.

711
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:34,500
First time I looked at this lady,
it changed my life.

712
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,333
You know da Vinci invented a technique
for brushstrokes that leave no lines?

713
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:44,250
That's how you can look straight at her,
and her expression changes every time.

714
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:48,500
Her smile's there, then it disappears.
Is she happy? Is she sad?

715
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:49,666
Is it something else?

716
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:54,041
This simple thing
that you thought you were looking at,

717
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:59,000
it suddenly takes on layers
and depth so complex,

718
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:00,958
it gives you vertigo.

719
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,250
It really is something.

720
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:05,916
It's a classic.

721
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:08,625
Hey. Not here.

722
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:13,083
Every time we've gotten to the point
where I'm going to strangle you,

723
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:15,333
you pull something like this,
and it's magic.

724
00:43:15,416 --> 00:43:17,791
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Look, it all started with her.

725
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:19,708
What did I say to you guys?

726
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:22,416
The first night we hung out
at the Glass Onion, what did I say?

727
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,708
I wanna be responsible
for something that gets mentioned

728
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:26,958
in the same breath as the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

729
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:28,000
Forever.

730
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:30,625
A-and what does that mean?

731
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,250
Oh, it means immortality.

732
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:34,416
He wants to do something
that's gonna change — 

733
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,875
Wait a minute, Miles.

734
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:39,500
Why do you have the <i>Mona Lisa</i>
in your living room?

735
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:42,166
In one week,

736
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:45,833
I've invited world leaders
and members of the press from all over

737
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,166
to come to this island.

738
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,208
And right here,
I'm going to unveil the future.

739
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,000
You know what this is?

740
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,875
You know damn well we do.

741
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:00,208
What's going on, Miles?

742
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:02,125
Uh… I don't.

743
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:04,041
- Don't drop it.
- Oh my God.

744
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:08,125
That's a new solid hydrogen fuel.
It's incredibly powerful.

745
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:09,458
It's radically efficient.

746
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:13,541
Zero carbon emissions,
and it's derived from abundant seawater.

747
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:16,458
I call it Klear, with a K.

748
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:20,500
And at this event,
we are going to announce "Klear America."

749
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:22,583
Our affordable home power solution.

750
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:25,333
Klear is going to be powering
people's dreams,

751
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:27,916
all over this country,
by the end of this year.

752
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:31,416
No.

753
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:34,916
No. Because I was clear with you.

754
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,708
I told you I need two years minimum

755
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:40,916
to test this stuff
to see if it's safe or even viable.

756
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:45,541
Claire and I are not gonna be responsible
for putting something out in the world

757
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:47,291
before it's tested and — 

758
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:53,208
Oh, no.

759
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,208
Oh, yeah.

760
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,708
No.

761
00:44:56,791 --> 00:45:00,750
You're running this entire place off this?

762
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:03,208
All of it. All this awesome lighting,

763
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:07,000
the heating and cooling,
everything right down to my fax machine.

764
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:10,958
The whole Glass Onion is powered by Klear.

765
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,333
Oh my God, Miles.

766
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,750
Guys, we did it.

767
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:16,791
I'm out. I'm done.

768
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:22,375
This is reckless.
And you're gonna get somebody killed.

769
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:24,291
Bro, you're not getting out.

770
00:45:24,916 --> 00:45:26,291
It's already happening.

771
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:29,916
I love you. Come on, let's… Let's eat!

772
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:35,625
Okay, gang.

773
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:41,500
It's been a memorable weekend already,
to be sure, but now the real fun starts.

774
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:47,416
We got three days to bask in the sun,
swim in the Ionian Sea,

775
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,750
eat good food and wine,
and enjoy each other's company.

776
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:54,958
But alongside and underneath the partay,
you've been charged with a serious task.

777
00:45:55,583 --> 00:46:00,750
Because tonight, in this very room,
a murder will be committed.

778
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,375
My murder.

779
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:06,708
You will have
to closely observe the crime.

780
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:09,000
Consider what you know about each other.

781
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:12,375
Know that across the island,
I've hidden clues.

782
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:16,625
Some may be helpful, some may misdirect.
That's for you to determine.

783
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:23,541
But if anyone can name the killer,
tell me how they achieved the murder,

784
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:26,875
and, most importantly,
what was the motive,

785
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:29,041
that person wins our game.

786
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:33,583
Any questions?

787
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:36,625
Uh, wait… What do we win?

788
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:40,250
I… What do you mean? What do you…

789
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,125
What do you want?

790
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,791
No. No, nothing, I just…

791
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:47,458
I just thought maybe
there was a prize or something.

792
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:51,041
I… An iPad or like…

793
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:56,125
Okay, fine.
Yeah, no, the winner gets an iPad.

794
00:46:57,083 --> 00:47:01,875
And, uh, once you're dead,
will we still be able to talk to you?

795
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:05,541
Yeah, I'm not playing dead
the whole weekend, dude.

796
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:06,708
We hang, but I…

797
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:09,416
You just can't ask me questions.
I'm not gonna help.

798
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,000
I don't actually need an iPad.
I'm just saying. It's just…

799
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:16,583
When you said "win," it…
You know, it made me say it.

800
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:18,458
Can we, um, work together?

801
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:21,708
Um, only one person
can solve the crime,

802
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:25,583
so if you got a theory,
keep it close to your chest.

803
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:28,958
It's designed to be hard.
This will take the whole weekend.

804
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:30,791
Well, this is truly delightful.

805
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,291
Oh! Have we started already, is it — 

806
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:36,791
- Well, the murder hasn't happened. But…
- Oh, yeah.

807
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:39,416
Yeah, why not? As Watson said to Holmes — 

808
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:43,458
It was Birdie
who planted a remote device on a crossbow

809
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:47,541
in revenge for you stealing
her signature Ren Diamond.

810
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:53,458
Look at the seating arrangement.

811
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:58,375
It triangulates Birdie
just perfectly with that thing,

812
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,958
which is loaded with a dummy bolt.

813
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,666
Aimed directly…

814
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:07,541
at Mr. Bron.

815
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:13,333
Now I believe close inspection will reveal
some sort of remote triggering device,

816
00:48:13,416 --> 00:48:19,500
but more damning,
that is a vintage Jayhawk brand crossbow.

817
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:22,166
Jayhawk, Birdie Jay.

818
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,875
Of course, there are other superfluous
and rather clumsy clues.

819
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:28,375
The hedgerow
in the south garden spells letter B.

820
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:31,833
Birdie's room is the sacral chakra,
which is the one blocked by guilt.

821
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:35,958
Blah, blah, blah. But the motive, yes,

822
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:40,000
on the cleverly planted 1998 issue
of <i>The Face</i> magazine

823
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,750
with Birdie on the cover…

824
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:46,916
…she famously wore
what became known as the Ren Diamond.

825
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And that's a family heirloom, I believe.

826
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:53,958
Well, to be clear, I mean, I didn't know
what a "blood diamond" was so — 

827
00:48:54,041 --> 00:49:00,083
Mr. Bron, the large pendulous locket
which is… Has not left your neck.

828
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:04,041
Bit out of keeping
with your breezy island style.

829
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:06,666
Would you kindly open it for us?

830
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:15,875
My Ren Diamond!

831
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:20,500
A dramatic, passionate
and colorful crime for a fashionista.

832
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:21,916
Miss Birdie Jay.

833
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:28,208
Unfortunately, this crime clashed
with the presence of Benoit Blanc.

834
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:34,791
Oh!

835
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:39,500
That… See that? That just went up…
Very good. Very good.

836
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:48,166
My God, that just felt so good.
So solid, so satisfying!

837
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,625
You know, like one of those
mini-crosswords <i>The Times</i> has

838
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:56,083
or, you know, I have a chef friend,
and she speaks of trying to create

839
00:49:56,166 --> 00:50:01,833
the perfect bite and that just felt like
the most satisfying bite-sized — 

840
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:09,166
You're angry.

841
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:15,000
No, Blanc, I'm, uh, just, you know…

842
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:16,708
What the hell?

843
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:21,458
That was not
the simplest thing to set up, so…

844
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:24,208
It's fine. It doesn't matter. It's just…

845
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:26,666
I hired Gillian Flynn
to write the whole thing — 

846
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:30,583
- Oh, she's quite good.
- She's goddamn expensive, is what she is.

847
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:35,333
What am I supposed to do now?
Play Yahtzee all weekend? Just…

848
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,333
Mr. Bron, truth is,
I… I ruined your game on purpose

849
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,458
and for a very good reason.

850
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:46,875
I'm sorry, what?

851
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:51,708
I like the Glass Onion as a metaphor.

852
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:54,666
An object that seems densely layered,

853
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,583
but in reality
the center is in plain sight.

854
00:50:58,166 --> 00:51:01,708
Your relationship with these people
may seem complex,

855
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:04,833
but look, what you've done
this weekend is crystal clear.

856
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:07,416
You've taken seven people,

857
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,791
each of whom has a real-life reason
to wish you harm,

858
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:13,791
gathered them together on a remote island

859
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:17,250
and placed the idea
of your murder in their heads.

860
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:22,375
It's like putting a loaded gun
on the table and turning off the lights!

861
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:24,166
Oh, whoa.

862
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,375
Come on.

863
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,750
So you play hardball with Lionel,
threaten to destroy his reputation

864
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:34,500
if he does not play along
and power a manned rocket with Klear.

865
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:36,250
But now with Claire too…

866
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:39,083
Now perhaps,
you threaten to support her opponent

867
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:43,958
in the up-and-coming election
if she does not approve your power plant.

868
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:46,208
You have done some homework.

869
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:49,000
And Birdie. Bangladesh.

870
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:51,958
Sweetie Pants are manufactured there
in a sweatshop.

871
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:55,458
You're making Birdie take the fall
to cover your ass as the main investor.

872
00:51:56,916 --> 00:52:02,375
And Duke? Well…
…we all know why Duke wants to kill you.

873
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:04,208
He doesn't know about that.

874
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,208
Yes, he does.

875
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,666
Take my presence as a sign.

876
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:16,500
For at least one person on this island,
this is not a game.

877
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:21,833
Oh, this is the famous napkin!

878
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:23,791
I know this story.

879
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,125
- Right…
- Will you look at that?

880
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:29,708
I sketched out the original idea
for Alpha on a cocktail napkin

881
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:32,583
and I showed it to Andi one night
at the Glass Onion.

882
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,791
That was our local bar.

883
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:40,791
That's where it all began.
But they tore it down the year after that.

884
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:41,750
Mm-hmm.

885
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,500
Andi.

886
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:46,791
Yes, Andi.

887
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,875
Andi used to tell me the truth.

888
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:52,458
Nobody does that now.

889
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56,166
It's all just fake smiles and agendas

890
00:52:56,250 --> 00:53:00,250
and people wanting
what they think they're owed.

891
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:06,000
Hating you when you don't give it to them
because that's what you're there for.

892
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:15,333
I know it's probably hard to have sympathy
for the poor, tortured billionaire. But…

893
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:18,416
God damn, I miss that bar.

894
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:40,291
You know, you could just power it down.

895
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:42,791
Ah, it's my Google Alerts.
Got them for all you guys.

896
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:45,000
Whiskey, sports I like, general interests.

897
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,708
You have a Google Alert
for the word "movie"?

898
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:52,208
I like movies. Don't hate. Nerd.

899
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:54,250
Oh, thank God for Benoit Blanc.

900
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:56,958
We don't have to
spend the weekend spelling hedges.

901
00:53:57,041 --> 00:53:59,875
Well, I'm out of here.
Tomorrow morning. Gone.

902
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:01,708
We just got here.

903
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,541
You can stay, have fun.

904
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:08,291
Fine. You're murdering my vibe.

905
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:11,791
Well, I hate saying this
in any context,

906
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:12,791
but I'm with Duke.

907
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:16,583
Or we can get drunk
and enjoy paradise for the weekend.

908
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,750
We should probably go too.

909
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:22,791
No. Miserable in paradise.
We've all earned this.

910
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:24,041
Yes, you have.

911
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:32,083
Are we even gonna talk about
the elephant in the room?

912
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:35,625
Or just gonna throw a blanket over it
and push through the weekend?

913
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:36,666
Am I the elephant?

914
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:39,250
Yeah. You're the elephant!

915
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:40,333
You're not that bad.

916
00:54:40,416 --> 00:54:42,125
What'd you come for, Andi?

917
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:45,333
Given the circumstances,
I think it's a fair question.

918
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:46,791
Fair?

919
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:51,875
Oh my God. Yes, no, fine.
Nothing about any of this is fair.

920
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,583
Congratulations. Now, you know.

921
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:58,958
And we all stuck with Miles.
What do you want?

922
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:04,708
Do you wanna know why we did it? Hmm?
Really? Why? Do the math. It's easy math.

923
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:09,666
So you come here,
in your Gucci flats, telling us…

924
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:10,583
Valentino.

925
00:55:10,666 --> 00:55:11,791
…that we owe you?

926
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:14,833
You made money off of Alpha
all those years.

927
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:16,583
You did fine. You got yours.

928
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:17,500
I got?

929
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:23,000
No, he got his from me. All of it!

930
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:28,291
My life was taken away from me
by someone, by everyone in this room.

931
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:31,500
My life! Do you even know what that means?

932
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,625
Huh?

933
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:35,416
What Claire's trying to say,
is we're sorry.

934
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,708
We feel bad for you. What do you want?

935
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:41,250
- Are you really asking me that?
- Yes. What do you want?

936
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,541
A check? You want performative pity?

937
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,458
Just tell us the right words
that we can use

938
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:49,416
so that we can get on with our lives.

939
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,083
You want revenge?
You want to slit Miles' throat?

940
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:56,916
You wanna take us all down?
What? Just drop the bombshell! Say it!

941
00:55:57,875 --> 00:55:59,625
- Say it!
- I want the truth!

942
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:03,083
I want the truth.

943
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,166
I can give you that.

944
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:11,125
I'll be the asshole.

945
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:20,708
The truth is, is that we
are all holding on to that golden tit.

946
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:23,375
We're all playing
the same game here, honey.

947
00:56:24,541 --> 00:56:25,500
You lost.

948
00:56:26,708 --> 00:56:29,166
So you can go ahead
and put yourself up on a cross

949
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,750
like some unspeakable crime
has been committed against you

950
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,791
that none of us could possibly imagine.

951
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,041
But me, I'm tired of pretending
like you're the victim in this game.

952
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:43,708
You just couldn't hack it.

953
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:49,500
You're the loser. There. That's the truth.

954
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,416
There she is. There's the Andi I know.

955
00:57:02,791 --> 00:57:03,708
Okay.

956
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:05,916
Oh, jeez, detective.

957
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,250
Your next assignment
is who killed the party.

958
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:11,875
Come on, guys!

959
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:15,458
Blanc ruined my game. It's okay.
Hey, Alpha DJ, give us something upbeat!

960
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:18,166
Miles, I'm gonna be leaving
in the morning.

961
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,041
Yeah, me too.

962
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:24,291
No. No, we're having a champagne brunch
on the beach tomorrow.

963
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:25,750
You're gonna try foil surfing,

964
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:28,125
and you're gonna put some aloe on,
work on that tan,

965
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:30,708
and make your constituents say,
"What was she doing in lockdown?"

966
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:32,416
Birdie, come on, dance with me.

967
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:36,791
Come on, pretty lady, get that smile up.
Come on, come on.

968
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,291
Where's Andi?

969
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,458
Yeah, where is Andi? Come on!

970
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:48,125
Hey. Duke's smiling.
There it is, there's my guy.

971
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:50,125
What's going on?
You look like you got good news.

972
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:52,833
I was wondering
why my Googs are blowing up.

973
00:57:52,916 --> 00:57:56,500
The views on my channel
are off the charts. You gotta see this.

974
00:57:56,583 --> 00:57:57,625
Ooh!

975
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:00,916
This is all over the Internet.
I mean, look at those numbers.

976
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:04,166
That's fire. That changes things, right?

977
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,500
It sure does.

978
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:09,458
Numbers like this.
Maybe we can talk Alpha News?

979
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:11,666
You bet your ass. Come here.

980
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:15,541
- Congratulations.
- Dukey! That's amazing! Let me see!

981
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,250
Everything works out in the end.

982
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:18,916
You gotta keep the faith.

983
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:21,708
Guys, have I ever let you down?

984
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:24,125
Have we ever not pulled through?
Pulled it off?

985
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,666
You're staying. Yes?
You're staying. Okay. Love it.

986
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:31,833
Come on, this is our time.

987
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:35,250
You feel it? What did we all used to say?
Fake it till you make it

988
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:37,583
and have fun while we're doing it.
It's happening.

989
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:42,708
We're all changing the world, all of us!
Making a dent in our own ways.

990
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:47,041
Five minutes ago, Blanc was telling me
that this whole party was a dangerous idea

991
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:50,708
'cause you all hate me so much
that one of you would actually wanna…

992
00:58:52,958 --> 00:58:55,375
- It doesn't even matter. It's so silly.
- Whoo!

993
00:58:55,458 --> 00:58:58,416
Wow! Look at that dress spin.
Birdie, that's amazing.

994
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,500
Just… Watch this dress.
Spin that dress again.

995
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:03,250
Everybody, Miles says look at me!

996
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,708
Look at you. She's a bird.

997
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:10,291
I want a toast.
I want a toast to The Disruptors.

998
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:12,791
My OGs. I love you. All of you.

999
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:16,666
Disruptors!
Breaking it and making it!

1000
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,750
Whoo!

1001
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:25,250
Turn up the music.
We're going in the pool tonight!

1002
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:27,833
We're all starting in the pool tonight.
That's what I want.

1003
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:29,250
Miles.

1004
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,083
On your feet, genius. I wanna see — 

1005
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:32,458
Miles, Duke.

1006
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:37,333
Whoo!

1007
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:41,791
Jesus.

1008
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:56,958
Duke!

1009
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:01,125
What… Is he choking?

1010
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:03,500
- Yeah, I think he's — 
- No, he's not choking.

1011
01:00:05,416 --> 01:00:06,583
- Okay.
- You got him?

1012
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:08,166
- Yeah.
- Duke.

1013
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:12,000
You see anything in there?
No, because I feel like he's…

1014
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,250
I…

1015
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,291
What?

1016
01:00:30,666 --> 01:00:34,166
I'm afraid Mr. Cody is… is dead.

1017
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:36,333
No, Duke! No!

1018
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,041
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

1019
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:46,208
What happened?
Did he choke? What happened?

1020
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:48,916
There was no obstruction
in his airways.

1021
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,791
But we won't know
the cause of death without an autopsy.

1022
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:53,166
What just happened?

1023
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,750
My dear, would you do me a favor?
Would you come sit over here?

1024
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:01,208
Just so I can take care of Mr. Cody.

1025
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:03,916
Yes, that's right. Mr. Bron, would…

1026
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,041
Would you call your boat
and have them come immediately?

1027
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:09,625
Oh my God. Oh my God.

1028
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:10,916
Mr. Bron!

1029
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,500
I'll do it. I'll do it.

1030
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:17,333
How do I do it?

1031
01:01:17,416 --> 01:01:19,833
There's a… There's a radio room,
through there.

1032
01:01:19,916 --> 01:01:22,041
You tell them we need
medical personnel and police.

1033
01:01:22,125 --> 01:01:22,958
Okay, yeah.

1034
01:01:23,041 --> 01:01:26,708
Listen, I must insist
that nobody touch the body

1035
01:01:26,791 --> 01:01:28,666
or disturb anything around it.

1036
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,625
Police?

1037
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:33,833
Are you treating this
as a crime scene then?

1038
01:01:33,916 --> 01:01:38,125
Oh my God. No, wait, wait, this is bad.
I can't. I…

1039
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:40,583
The police always come. It's protocol.

1040
01:01:40,666 --> 01:01:42,083
I can see the headlines!

1041
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:46,666
"Governor jets off to Greece in a pandemic
with a men's rights YouTuber who dies!"

1042
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,083
Oh my God. No, I — 

1043
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:51,166
Bacardi…

1044
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:57,750
I think Mr. Blanc's…

1045
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:01,250
You're not saying
it was done with intention, are you?

1046
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:02,625
Well, we don't know.

1047
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:06,750
But Mr. Cody's death was
so acute and violent… yes.

1048
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:13,333
My guess is something
was put in his drink, intentionally.

1049
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:21,875
What do you mean "morning"?
How's that possible?

1050
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:24,500
<i>Pisceshite! Dock is Pisceshite!</i>

1051
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:26,791
Piece-of-shite. Piece of…

1052
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:33,625
Boat can't come till low tide
in the morning. 6:00 a.m. at the earliest.

1053
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,958
Do they understand the situation?

1054
01:02:36,041 --> 01:02:37,666
There is no other landing point,

1055
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:41,250
and Miles' dumbass Banksy dock
was set to low-tide height

1056
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:43,708
and it isn't buoyant.
It is a piece of shit.

1057
01:02:43,791 --> 01:02:47,125
Oh, heck. Yeah, all right, all right. Um…

1058
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:52,291
I suggest you all retire to your rooms,
lock the doors until 5:30,

1059
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:56,208
when we will convene here
and walk together to the dock.

1060
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:57,833
I'll stay up all night with the body.

1061
01:02:57,916 --> 01:03:00,791
Make sure it's not tampered with
in any way.

1062
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:03,541
I recommend that everyone gets some sleep.

1063
01:03:08,416 --> 01:03:10,000
Oh!

1064
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:16,250
That is…

1065
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:18,708
That's your glass, Miles.

1066
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:23,291
He…

1067
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:26,750
He picked up mine.

1068
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:32,333
He picked up mine.

1069
01:03:32,416 --> 01:03:33,333
He…

1070
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,791
Now we could…

1071
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:40,708
Uh…

1072
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:43,291
Oh, come on, Miles.

1073
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:45,125
Miles, it's us!

1074
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:46,750
Miles, baby, for real?

1075
01:03:47,541 --> 01:03:49,000
I'll pay you one billion dollars

1076
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:50,833
to tell me
which one of them tried to kill me.

1077
01:03:50,916 --> 01:03:51,958
- Miles!
- Miles!

1078
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:55,541
I'm just going to silence Duke's phone.

1079
01:03:57,666 --> 01:03:59,041
We're staying here in this room.

1080
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:02,833
I'm keeping you all in plain sight
until that boat arrives.

1081
01:04:02,916 --> 01:04:05,333
- That's what we're doing.
- For God's sakes.

1082
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:10,041
Where's Whiskey? Where's Andi?

1083
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:11,958
Where's Duke's phone?

1084
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:14,625
It just dinged. It must be here.

1085
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:16,041
Yeah, I saw it.

1086
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:17,750
We just heard it.

1087
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:19,958
It isn't in any of his pockets.

1088
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:23,708
Well, he must have dropped it somewhere.
Let's wait for it to ding again.

1089
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:25,375
Forget about his phone. Look.

1090
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:31,250
Where is his stupid gun?

1091
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:37,250
Oh, fiddlesticks.
When did his gun disappear?

1092
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:38,750
He always has his gun.

1093
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:42,416
Well, he always has it,
which means we stopped seeing it.

1094
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,583
But at some point this evening,
it was gone.

1095
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,625
- When was that?
- Andi.

1096
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:49,208
We need to find Andi.

1097
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:50,583
Andi!

1098
01:04:51,208 --> 01:04:52,500
Oh.

1099
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:54,666
- Mr. Bron!
- <i>Dong!</i>

1100
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:58,500
Oh, it's all right.
It's just that hourly dong thing.

1101
01:04:58,583 --> 01:04:59,708
What?

1102
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:02,916
- Oh, no. No.
- Miles, calm down!

1103
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,333
Oh, shit. Shit.

1104
01:05:04,416 --> 01:05:06,958
- No. It's happening.
- Mr. Bron. What is the matter?

1105
01:05:07,041 --> 01:05:10,750
It was the game. The game! My murder game.
We were gonna be having drinks,

1106
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:13,166
and I thought it'd be fun
to say something dramatic at 10:00.

1107
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,625
We were gonna have
20 minutes where…

1108
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:19,041
Blanc, you have to help me.
You have to help me. Help me! Help me!

1109
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,625
What happens at ten o'clock?

1110
01:05:31,916 --> 01:05:34,125
- Birdie, listen to my voice.
- Oh my God.

1111
01:05:34,208 --> 01:05:35,625
- Is that you?
- Stop screaming.

1112
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:37,958
- Something touched me!
- Do not panic!

1113
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:39,583
- It's so dark.
- I'm here.

1114
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:42,125
- Where's my phone? It has a flashlight.
- I can't see.

1115
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:43,916
- How does this — 
- Lionel!

1116
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,333
- Claire?
- Everybody…

1117
01:05:45,416 --> 01:05:46,583
- Over here!
- I'm here!

1118
01:05:46,666 --> 01:05:49,583
Stand still. Calm down. Do not panic.

1119
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:53,250
It was Andi! It was Andi.

1120
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:57,166
She killed Duke,
and she tore our room apart. I saw her!

1121
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,916
- What?!
- Is that a speargun?

1122
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,666
No. Not today!

1123
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,458
Wait, wait, wait.

1124
01:06:03,541 --> 01:06:05,833
- Mr. Bron!
- What the hell is happening?

1125
01:06:05,916 --> 01:06:08,541
Oh, hell's bells!
Just, everybody, just stay here!

1126
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,791
Aha! Here's my phone!

1127
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:32,958
Birdie? Lionel? Guys?

1128
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Andi?

1129
01:06:44,666 --> 01:06:45,666
Andi!

1130
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:55,625
Who's that?

1131
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,666
Oh, Lord help us.

1132
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:13,583
Helen.

1133
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:16,750
Now listen, did you take Duke's gun?

1134
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,916
Why would I take Duke's gun?
Why are the lights out?

1135
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,333
- Duke is dead.
- What?

1136
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:38,291
I don't understand.

1137
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:42,000
Please. Trust me. It's all in plain sight.

1138
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:46,833
We only need one last piece
of information, but only you can — 

1139
01:07:58,416 --> 01:07:59,791
Lionel? Lionel?

1140
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:02,666
Guys? Where are you?

1141
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,375
I'm here! What happened?

1142
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:06,333
- Did you hear that?
- Guys?

1143
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,541
I heard it from here.
Everybody all right?

1144
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:09,541
What was that?

1145
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:12,958
Was that a gunshot?
It sounded like a gunshot.

1146
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:48,916
Oh, God.

1147
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,791
Everyone. Inside.

1148
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:06,083
- Shouldn't we — 
- She's not going anywhere.

1149
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,500
It's time to finish this.

1150
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:19,333
Peg, radio the mainland.
Tell them to send the boats now.

1151
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:22,416
Banksy be damned!
Beach them if they have to!

1152
01:09:24,416 --> 01:09:27,250
- She killed Duke. Why would she — 
- No.

1153
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:30,500
It makes no sense.

1154
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:31,958
It all makes perfect sense.

1155
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:34,625
Duke, Andi, this weekend,

1156
01:09:34,708 --> 01:09:38,458
this ridiculous game that started
well before we set foot on this island.

1157
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:41,708
Will you explain it to us then, detective?

1158
01:09:41,791 --> 01:09:45,208
No, I can peel back the layers,

1159
01:09:45,291 --> 01:09:49,750
I can take it to a point,
but what lies at the center,

1160
01:09:51,416 --> 01:09:55,458
only one person can tell us
who killed Cassandra Brand.

1161
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:08,916
Get that, would ya?

1162
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:12,375
You're not in the bath again,
are you?

1163
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,708
No!

1164
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:19,416
Yep?

1165
01:10:20,958 --> 01:10:21,791
Uh…

1166
01:10:23,291 --> 01:10:24,375
Can I help you?

1167
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:27,541
Yes, is this Benoit Blanc's residence?

1168
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:29,875
Um, what is this regarding?

1169
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:34,250
Well, his office was closed,
and I really need to speak with him.

1170
01:10:34,333 --> 01:10:36,416
It's urgent. Please.

1171
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:40,833
Blanc! There's someone here for you.

1172
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:43,583
With a box!

1173
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,166
Oh my.

1174
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:52,625
Well, why don't we start at the beginning?

1175
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:58,208
My name is Helen Brand,
and I came all the way here from Alabama.

1176
01:10:59,791 --> 01:11:02,458
Well, what do you do in Alabama?

1177
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:06,333
I teach. Third grade. Do a lot of Zooming.

1178
01:11:07,291 --> 01:11:10,500
We've been getting into tie-dying a lot
and all this pandemic stuff.

1179
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:14,416
Okay, none of that really matters.

1180
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:17,625
Mr. Blanc, two days ago,
I received a call.

1181
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:19,833
My twin sister committed suicide.

1182
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:23,458
<i>In her car.</i>

1183
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:27,583
<i>In her garage.</i>

1184
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,750
<i>With the engine running.</i>

1185
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:39,541
My sister was Cassandra Brand.
Do you know who she was?

1186
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:45,333
Yes, of course. I'm sorry, you…
I thought you looked familiar.

1187
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:48,500
Impressive woman, your sister.

1188
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:52,833
You know, she kept a journal
every day of her life

1189
01:11:52,916 --> 01:11:54,625
since she was six years old.

1190
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:56,666
You know what she called it?

1191
01:11:57,416 --> 01:12:02,291
"Notes For Future Biographers."
Biographers. Plural.

1192
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:04,791
The girl was six years old.

1193
01:12:04,875 --> 01:12:07,333
Then the day after high school,
she shot off to New York,

1194
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:08,708
and she just never looked back.

1195
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,791
You know, when we were kids,

1196
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:13,791
we goofed together,
and we'd do this character, Rich Bitch.

1197
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:18,375
"Heavens, the dog ate the caviar again."

1198
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:22,916
Then I hear her doing a talk,
and that's exactly how she sounded.

1199
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,083
Rich Bitch! And I'm like,
"Who are you fooling, girl? Not me!"

1200
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:29,416
She had the guts and brains
for both of us,

1201
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,625
and I was just happy watching her,
you know?

1202
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:35,416
So you, um… You get the call…

1203
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,916
Yeah, yeah. I get the call and I fly in.
This was yesterday.

1204
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,958
And then I go to Andi's house.
I'm cleaning it out. It's a mess.

1205
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:44,708
All of her books everywhere.

1206
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:47,875
And I'm just thinking about
what was taken from my sister,

1207
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:49,875
how I wasn't there for her.

1208
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:53,625
And I'm getting angrier and angrier,
and then I just hear a knock at the door,

1209
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:57,041
and it's some courier
with this thing from Miles Bron.

1210
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:59,958
And I'm sure there's
some clever way to open it.

1211
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:02,000
I don't know. I just open it.

1212
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:03,458
And it's an invitation

1213
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:06,791
to his private island in Greece
for next weekend.

1214
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:10,833
One of those little trips she'd go on
with him and his group of shitheads.

1215
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:13,708
They like to call themselves
"The Disruptors."

1216
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:19,083
But I knew who they were,
and I told her who they were. Shitheads.

1217
01:13:22,416 --> 01:13:26,208
Miss Brand, what can I do for you?

1218
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:29,750
Andi didn't commit suicide.

1219
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,791
She didn't leave any note.

1220
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:35,875
So I went on her computer,
and I looked in her email,

1221
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:38,541
her sent messages,
to see if she wrote anybody anything.

1222
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:44,166
And look. She sent this at 4:00 p.m.,
the day she was murdered, four days ago.

1223
01:13:45,166 --> 01:13:46,666
"I finally found it."

1224
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:51,083
"It's right here, and I'm going to use it
to burn his whole empire down."

1225
01:13:51,166 --> 01:13:53,875
"I'm giving you all one last chance
to make things right."

1226
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,958
"You know where to find me. A."

1227
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:01,958
And I'm assuming
all of these names here are — 

1228
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:05,916
Birdie Jay, Duke Cody,
Claire Debella and Lionel Toussaint.

1229
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,125
The Shitheads.

1230
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:10,541
She sends that email,
nobody writes back anything,

1231
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:13,333
and then the next day,
she's dead in the garage

1232
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:15,125
with sleeping pills in her system?

1233
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:19,458
I searched every inch
of every room in her house,

1234
01:14:19,541 --> 01:14:21,291
and guess what wasn't there?

1235
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:24,958
The red envelope.

1236
01:14:27,916 --> 01:14:28,916
Compelling.

1237
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:32,625
Google said you are
the world's greatest detective.

1238
01:14:32,708 --> 01:14:34,583
Somebody like me,
takes something like this

1239
01:14:34,666 --> 01:14:37,666
about a group of rich folk
with an army full of lawyers — 

1240
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:39,583
But if one was to get 'em alone,

1241
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:44,666
isolated for a weekend with,
in your words,

1242
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:47,000
the world's greatest detective…

1243
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:51,375
You wanna hire me to go to that island.

1244
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:53,041
It's a stupid idea, right?

1245
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:55,166
Listen, I want to be clear, huh?

1246
01:14:55,916 --> 01:14:57,291
I am not Batman.

1247
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:59,875
I can find you the truth,
I can gather evidence,

1248
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:03,291
I can present it to the police
and the courts, but…

1249
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:05,416
…that is where my jurisdiction ends.

1250
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,166
Yeah, but it's you doing it instead of me.
I'll take those odds.

1251
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,791
I've not seen
your sister's death in the news.

1252
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:14,250
- Did you release a statement?
- No.

1253
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:15,833
Shit. Was I supposed to?

1254
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:18,291
I don't know how this works.

1255
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:21,833
And you have no other family member
who was informed of the death and…

1256
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:25,250
Oh, if I pulled a few strings,

1257
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:29,000
I could keep it from leaking
to the press for another… week?

1258
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:30,583
Maybe, that's…

1259
01:15:31,833 --> 01:15:32,666
Oh.

1260
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:35,875
No, that's outrageous. That wouldn't…

1261
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:39,041
Well, now…

1262
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:44,000
Wow. No, that… Yes. Miss Brand.

1263
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:50,041
Any feelings of reverence or respect
that you had for me

1264
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:53,666
when you crossed my threshold,
buttress those feelings now.

1265
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:54,625
Buttress them.

1266
01:15:56,291 --> 01:16:02,083
I am proposing
that you come with me to that island

1267
01:16:03,166 --> 01:16:04,333
as your sister.

1268
01:16:05,416 --> 01:16:07,125
As Cassandra Brand.

1269
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:12,458
What? No.
No, no, no, I'm hiring you to go.

1270
01:16:13,416 --> 01:16:15,958
I… I'm not… Are you insane?

1271
01:16:16,041 --> 01:16:17,666
Buttress now. Yes.

1272
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,583
A famous detective shows up

1273
01:16:19,666 --> 01:16:23,083
and out of the blue,
starts poking the subject of your sister,

1274
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:24,833
they'll shut up like a clam.

1275
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:30,541
Your presence on that island
is the essential catalyst.

1276
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:32,625
- Oh, no, come on, man.
- Buttress.

1277
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:36,000
Yeah, I'm trying real hard to buttress,
but this sounds nuts.

1278
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:38,250
But it is the only way that this works.

1279
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:41,750
Look at me.
They'll know instantly that I'm not her.

1280
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:44,083
You'll cut your hair.
You'll wear her clothes.

1281
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:46,416
Oh, you really think
I can fit into that shit?

1282
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,041
- And what about my hair?
- I know a guy.

1283
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:51,333
Now, why would anyone suspect

1284
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:55,625
you showing up, playing your sister,
when they don't know your sister is dead?

1285
01:16:58,791 --> 01:16:59,666
Right.

1286
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:01,916
They don't know Andi is dead.

1287
01:17:03,541 --> 01:17:05,333
So why would they suspect anything?

1288
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:11,375
- And you'll do the inspecting?
- Yes, I will. You just have to be there.

1289
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:16,958
Mr. Blanc, is… Is this safe?

1290
01:17:19,166 --> 01:17:20,083
No. No.

1291
01:17:21,166 --> 01:17:23,625
One person will know the truth about you.

1292
01:17:24,375 --> 01:17:26,083
From the moment you arrive on that island,

1293
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:28,916
the killer will know who you are
and what you are doing.

1294
01:17:29,416 --> 01:17:32,458
And they certainly wouldn't hesitate
to kill again if it covers their tracks.

1295
01:17:32,541 --> 01:17:36,708
I'm… I'm a detective, Helen.
I'm not a bodyguard.

1296
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:40,041
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

1297
01:17:41,291 --> 01:17:42,250
No.

1298
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:48,125
One of those shitheads killed my sister.

1299
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:56,166
Do you really think
we can get the son of a bitch?

1300
01:18:24,541 --> 01:18:25,750
Well, my goodness.

1301
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:30,750
I shouldn't be here. This is nuts.
But I'm here. So let's do this.

1302
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:34,000
- Drink?
- You need a drink.

1303
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:36,000
Oh, no, I don't drink.
I'll have some coffee.

1304
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,041
All right.

1305
01:18:37,541 --> 01:18:38,500
Andi's journals.

1306
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:42,375
Good, you keep studying them.
Okay, so… Tomorrow.

1307
01:18:42,958 --> 01:18:44,125
I'll get there early.

1308
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:47,541
Really lay on some Southern hokum,
get them all off guard.

1309
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:50,166
On the boat… be cold.

1310
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,458
Don't engage in conversation.

1311
01:18:51,541 --> 01:18:53,583
- Okay, I'm not great on boats.
- Oh, you'll be fine.

1312
01:18:53,666 --> 01:18:57,083
Just remember, Rich Bitch voice.
Andi posture.

1313
01:18:58,208 --> 01:19:00,666
I have all of her TED Talks on this,
and I've been studying 'em.

1314
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:01,916
Good.

1315
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:05,958
- The dog ate the caviar.
- There you go.

1316
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:07,375
Yeah.

1317
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:08,958
So, you said

1318
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:11,041
you were gonna be researching
these folks for motive.

1319
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:12,333
Did you find anything?

1320
01:19:12,416 --> 01:19:13,625
Yes, I did.

1321
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:17,166
But motives for each of them
to want Miles Bron dead.

1322
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:20,083
Now why would they
kill her to protect him?

1323
01:19:20,166 --> 01:19:21,375
I just don't get it.

1324
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:24,166
What about Miles? What if he just did it?

1325
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:28,375
Well, we can't rule it out,
but Miles Bron is not an idiot.

1326
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:32,375
To risk committing murder
after a very public court case,

1327
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:35,083
with the possibility
of that email of Andi's coming to light,

1328
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:37,916
would be an exceedingly
stupid thing to do.

1329
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,291
Especially if someone
was willing to do it for him.

1330
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,416
Come on. Walk me through these journals.

1331
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:44,000
Okay.

1332
01:19:44,541 --> 01:19:47,208
About ten years ago,
before they all hit it big,

1333
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:48,833
<i>they used to hang together at this bar.</i>

1334
01:19:48,916 --> 01:19:50,875
<i>And Miles was leader of the pack?</i>

1335
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:52,166
<i>No. Andi was.</i>

1336
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:54,250
<i>They were all friends with Andi.</i>

1337
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,625
<i>Birdie was a washed-up model.</i>

1338
01:19:56,708 --> 01:20:00,000
<i>Duke was a nerd doing
video game tournaments.</i>

1339
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:02,166
<i>Claire just lost a race for city council.</i>

1340
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,291
<i>Lionel was a substitute teacher.</i>

1341
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:06,541
<i>All of them run aground in their thirties.</i>

1342
01:20:06,625 --> 01:20:09,500
<i>But Andi saw their potentials.
She found them all.</i>

1343
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:10,583
- Hi!
- Hey!

1344
01:20:10,666 --> 01:20:13,333
<i>Then she found Miles.
Introduced him to the group.</i>

1345
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:14,958
This is Miles.

1346
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:16,708
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Hey, bro.

1347
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:17,833
I love your hair.

1348
01:20:17,916 --> 01:20:19,666
<i>At first, nobody liked him.</i>

1349
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:20,916
…outlive the person…

1350
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,125
<i>He'd say stuff like…</i>

1351
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:24,458
I want to be responsible for something

1352
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:28,291
that gets talked about in the same breath
as the <i>Mona Lisa.</i> Forever.

1353
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:30,708
What does that even mean?

1354
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:32,291
It just means immortality.

1355
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:35,125
He wants to create something
that feels lasting, that feels — 

1356
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:37,791
His first venture was Moviefone
for foot massages.

1357
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,666
- Did it work?
- No!

1358
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:41,583
Okay, listen, let's just roll with it.

1359
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:44,333
Let's humor him. Let's see where it goes.
Let's see what happens.

1360
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:46,875
- Hey, team.
<i>And things started happening.</i>

1361
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:51,666
<i>He got Birdie a show
for her designs. It did well.</i>

1362
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:55,041
<i>Got Lionel published.
Duke set up at Twitch.</i>

1363
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:56,750
<i>Claire elected locally.</i>

1364
01:20:56,833 --> 01:20:58,250
…at you. I love you back!

1365
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:01,000
<i>You know, small stuff,
but it happened.</i>

1366
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:04,375
<i>And then the big thing happened.</i>

1367
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:07,250
What is that you're working on?

1368
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:18,916
So based on the napkin idea,
Andi and Miles created Alpha.

1369
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,375
It blows up.
They bring everyone along for the ride.

1370
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:24,625
Miles' aspirations
keep getting bigger and bigger.

1371
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:25,916
Cut to two years ago,

1372
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,166
Miles meets
some sketchy Norwegian scientist

1373
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,583
at an ayahuasca ceremony in Peru

1374
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:33,166
who sells him
on this whole new hydrogen fuel.

1375
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:36,541
- Hmm.
- He becomes obsessed.

1376
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:40,583
And he's willing to give the company's
entire resources to launch this thing.

1377
01:21:42,041 --> 01:21:43,041
No.

1378
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:46,666
Andi. Andi, come on. This is it!

1379
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:50,583
No, no, no. This is not a start-up.
This could blow up the world.

1380
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:51,500
Yeah.

1381
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:54,416
No! Literally, Miles.
This could blow up the world!

1382
01:21:55,416 --> 01:22:00,583
The reality-distortion field ends here.
I can't let you do this.

1383
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:04,208
What… What do you mean you can't let me?

1384
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:05,750
I'll walk.

1385
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:09,750
And I'll take half the company
to stop you from using it for this.

1386
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:13,166
And she did it.
And, God, I love that she did it.

1387
01:22:13,916 --> 01:22:16,750
Then she found out Miles
had the lawyers work the contract

1388
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:18,541
so she was cut out the company completely.

1389
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:20,375
So she sued over that?

1390
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:21,833
Her whole case was based on

1391
01:22:21,916 --> 01:22:25,250
intellectual ownership
of the company's founding idea.

1392
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:27,250
Her idea on the napkin.

1393
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,750
Which she didn't keep.

1394
01:22:29,833 --> 01:22:33,666
Miles was very excited. He had an idea.

1395
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,625
Uh, so he grabbed a napkin,

1396
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:40,208
and he, uh, he scribbled
something on it to show us.

1397
01:22:40,291 --> 01:22:44,166
- That's a lie! Your Honor, it's a lie.
- Order! Counsel, get your client — 

1398
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,958
Look me in the eye, Claire!
You know it's a lie!

1399
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:48,708
It's a lie.

1400
01:22:49,958 --> 01:22:53,666
And do you recall, Mr. Cody,
who wrote this napkin?

1401
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:54,833
Yeah, Miles.

1402
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:57,583
Uh, it was Miles.

1403
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:00,083
Miles.

1404
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:04,291
<i>This was March.</i>

1405
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,250
<i>And right after the verdict,</i>

1406
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:10,541
<i>Miles suddenly found the napkin
written in his handwriting</i>

1407
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:12,958
<i>and did all those interviews about it.</i>

1408
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:15,041
<i>A bald-faced fabrication.</i>

1409
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:19,083
A damn lie, and it worked.

1410
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:59,333
So… every one of The Disruptors
perjured themselves

1411
01:23:59,416 --> 01:24:02,375
to destroy Andi and shield Miles Bron.

1412
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:06,666
We… You and I,
we need to find out why. Motive.

1413
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:10,458
Whose was strong enough
to go one step further and commit murder?

1414
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:12,250
And then, this will be tricky,

1415
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:15,625
everyone's whereabouts
on the night of her death.

1416
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:19,666
Who could have been
at Andi's house that night? Opportunity.

1417
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:24,083
- Our suspects, motive, opportunity… Hey!
- Mm-hmm.

1418
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:27,500
- This kinda looks like that <i>Clue</i> notepad.
- Yes, yes, yes.

1419
01:24:27,583 --> 01:24:29,125
You must be really great at <i>Clue,</i> huh?

1420
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:32,458
I'm very bad at dumb things.
My Achilles' heel.

1421
01:24:32,541 --> 01:24:35,541
Ticking boxes, running around,
searching all the rooms.

1422
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:37,375
It's just a terrible, terrible game.

1423
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:39,666
Well, my students love it.

1424
01:24:44,916 --> 01:24:45,791
I'm scared.

1425
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:49,875
I understand.

1426
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:55,125
This is your last chance to back out.

1427
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:18,791
Oh, God. Boats.

1428
01:25:23,916 --> 01:25:25,000
Ballsy move.

1429
01:25:26,041 --> 01:25:27,625
You shouldn't be here.

1430
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:40,916
Duke and Birdie, I think they're onto me.
Or they were just being assholes.

1431
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,583
Well, that's not mutually exclusive.

1432
01:25:42,666 --> 01:25:45,041
Now, look, I suspect,
when we're all settling in,

1433
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:47,916
Bron's going to pull me aside
to explain my presence.

1434
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,958
That is your chance to snoop.

1435
01:25:50,041 --> 01:25:50,875
Snoop?

1436
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:52,916
Snoop.

1437
01:25:56,916 --> 01:25:59,166
Snooping. Snoop.

1438
01:26:00,791 --> 01:26:02,791
Okay, here we go.

1439
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:16,166
- Hey.
- Hi.

1440
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,125
Andi.

1441
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:19,333
Yes.

1442
01:26:19,416 --> 01:26:21,833
I'm Whiskey. We didn't really meet.

1443
01:26:22,916 --> 01:26:25,791
- Are you looking for the pool?
- I am.

1444
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:28,000
- Do you want to walk?
- Sure.

1445
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:31,291
Do you want this? I'm not into it.
It smells like that guy Derol.

1446
01:26:32,166 --> 01:26:34,958
That's a beautiful necklace.
You're a Taurus?

1447
01:26:35,041 --> 01:26:37,333
Yeah. Um, Miles got it for me.

1448
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:41,958
He, um, surprised me for my birthday.

1449
01:26:42,041 --> 01:26:44,750
He filled his entire
penthouse apartment with roses.

1450
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:45,958
It was very cute.

1451
01:26:47,375 --> 01:26:50,458
He's a really good guy. He's complicated.

1452
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:52,875
But…

1453
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,000
I think it's really shitty
what they all did to you.

1454
01:26:57,875 --> 01:26:59,333
And how they all treated you.

1455
01:26:59,416 --> 01:27:01,875
I read your court transcripts,
and you got shanked.

1456
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:06,041
Thanks, Whiskey.

1457
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:08,083
Yeah, this is my second one
of these things.

1458
01:27:08,166 --> 01:27:09,458
We did a yacht thing last year.

1459
01:27:09,541 --> 01:27:11,166
Well, that sounds fun.

1460
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:13,166
No.

1461
01:27:13,958 --> 01:27:16,791
I mean, when they're all together,
it's kind of the worst.

1462
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:20,208
Duke just treats me like arm candy,
and they just ignore me.

1463
01:27:20,291 --> 01:27:22,333
- Why do you put up with it?
- With Duke?

1464
01:27:23,958 --> 01:27:28,208
I'm building my brand, and he's putting me
on his channel more often.

1465
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:32,750
Though, he's leaning harder right
into this mandom stuff.

1466
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:35,000
If I'm going to go
into politics eventually,

1467
01:27:35,916 --> 01:27:37,666
I don't think
that's a road I wanna go down.

1468
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:40,500
It's expeditious,
but it's kind of a shitshow.

1469
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:45,041
- Oh, here's the pool.
- I'm gonna walk around a little longer.

1470
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:46,625
- I'll catch you over there.
- Okay.

1471
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:49,041
Hey, it's really great
talking to you, Whiskey.

1472
01:27:49,125 --> 01:27:50,041
You too.

1473
01:27:55,708 --> 01:27:58,875
<i>Dong!</i>

1474
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:01,875
Oh my God!

1475
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:02,791
Really.

1476
01:28:03,916 --> 01:28:04,791
Asshole.

1477
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:06,625
Now it's a party.

1478
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:10,583
I did it. Two weeks ago, I did it.

1479
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:13,500
You signed off on the power plant.

1480
01:28:13,583 --> 01:28:16,458
Yep. When this thing breaks, poof.

1481
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:20,375
My whole base is gone.
The grassroots lefties? Gone.

1482
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:21,833
I did it too.

1483
01:28:21,916 --> 01:28:22,875
Did what?

1484
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:26,208
I signed off on putting Klear
in a manned mission.

1485
01:28:26,291 --> 01:28:28,625
- The staff doesn't know it yet.
- Oh, God damn it.

1486
01:28:29,583 --> 01:28:32,500
Let's just pray that
Andi was wrong about this Klear stuff.

1487
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:34,041
No, she was right.

1488
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:37,333
You put its gas form
into household piping,

1489
01:28:37,416 --> 01:28:40,291
there's massive leakage into the air.
The hydrogen particles are too small.

1490
01:28:40,375 --> 01:28:41,500
Hydrogen gas?

1491
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,416
Lionel. I sold my soul for this.

1492
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:50,458
You're telling me that it could literally
turn people's homes into the Hindenburg?

1493
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:57,000
I will take care of him. Don't worry.

1494
01:29:02,583 --> 01:29:04,541
There was a time, you know, back when…

1495
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:08,458
I was the one on magazines. He was nobody.

1496
01:29:09,291 --> 01:29:11,666
He was this little thing in my hand.

1497
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:14,291
I preferred that.

1498
01:29:20,083 --> 01:29:22,208
Andi! Hi!

1499
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:28,958
Wow! No.
You're really good at this.

1500
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:33,375
This is interesting stuff about Whiskey
and motives for both Lionel and Claire.

1501
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:34,458
Well done!

1502
01:29:34,541 --> 01:29:37,166
Those were motives?
Because I was kind of confused.

1503
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:39,833
Oh, no, they bet the farm
and will both be ruined

1504
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:41,750
along with Miles if he fails.

1505
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:44,250
They need to protect him at all costs.

1506
01:29:44,333 --> 01:29:46,833
But I can't imagine them killing her.
I just can't.

1507
01:29:46,916 --> 01:29:50,500
Think of the crime, the nature of it.

1508
01:29:51,791 --> 01:29:55,500
<i>No, they've come to apologize,
to make amends.</i>

1509
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:59,750
<i>And the murder itself, it's nonviolent.</i>

1510
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:01,916
<i>Gentle even.</i>

1511
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:06,833
<i>They don't even see her die.</i>

1512
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:10,291
<i>She just goes to sleep.</i>

1513
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:15,250
No. No.

1514
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:18,000
They're all more than capable.

1515
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,416
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1516
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,333
I thought you said you didn't drink?

1517
01:30:26,416 --> 01:30:29,875
Oh, this? This isn't a drink.
This is some funky health stuff.

1518
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,916
No, you give me that.

1519
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,833
That's hard kombucha.
That's Jared Leto's hard kombucha.

1520
01:30:36,916 --> 01:30:39,416
What is it that? That's 9% alcohol or so…

1521
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,416
Get off that.
How many of these things you had?

1522
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:44,083
I don't know, but I feel fine.

1523
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:46,416
Okay? We need to focus.

1524
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:49,916
We need to focus. We need
to find the O's, the opportunities.

1525
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,125
We got to open them up. It's time to push.

1526
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:54,750
No, no, no.
We're not pushing anything right now.

1527
01:30:54,833 --> 01:30:56,833
Listen, I feel good.

1528
01:30:56,916 --> 01:30:58,333
I think maybe you should lie down.

1529
01:30:58,416 --> 01:31:00,375
- We're running out of time, Blanc!
- Helen!

1530
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:02,083
Helen…

1531
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:04,291
Please.

1532
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:05,916
Think of the danger here.

1533
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,458
You gotta step back
and let me handle this.

1534
01:31:09,166 --> 01:31:10,208
Push nothing.

1535
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:15,833
<i>They're gonna tell you to stop.</i>

1536
01:31:16,416 --> 01:31:19,833
Even your partner will say,
"You need to stop."

1537
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:22,458
Because as it turns out,

1538
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:26,166
nobody wants you to break
the system itself.

1539
01:31:26,916 --> 01:31:29,958
But that is what true disruption is.

1540
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:34,208
And that is what unites all of us.

1541
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:37,125
We all got to that line and crossed it.

1542
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:41,791
Andi…

1543
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,333
Wait! Wait.

1544
01:31:46,666 --> 01:31:49,541
Wait? No, you wait!

1545
01:31:50,458 --> 01:31:53,208
That day in court,
you couldn't even look me in the eye.

1546
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:57,000
What are you doing?

1547
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:07,000
You want to talk about the email?

1548
01:32:07,083 --> 01:32:07,916
Oh.

1549
01:32:08,541 --> 01:32:12,958
So now you want to talk about the email?
You didn't even write back.

1550
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:15,458
I'm a politician.

1551
01:32:15,541 --> 01:32:17,041
I never email anything

1552
01:32:17,125 --> 01:32:20,208
that I wouldn't want to see
on the front page of <i>The Times.</i>

1553
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:21,583
That's why I called.

1554
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:26,666
We all did.
Right after we got it, over and over.

1555
01:32:27,166 --> 01:32:30,750
You… Your phone was off,
and then the whole next week.

1556
01:32:31,708 --> 01:32:32,875
Yeah, I've got a new number.

1557
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:37,166
And when we couldn't reach you,
I went to your house.

1558
01:32:37,916 --> 01:32:40,125
<i>Lionel and I got there</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

1559
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:41,458
<i>Duke was already there.</i>

1560
01:32:41,541 --> 01:32:43,250
- Andi!
- Hey, Andi?

1561
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:44,375
<i>The lights were out.</i>

1562
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:46,458
<i>I was pounding so hard,
I almost broke it down.</i>

1563
01:32:46,541 --> 01:32:47,375
Andi!

1564
01:32:49,291 --> 01:32:52,166
We knocked, waited, and called for you,
but after an hour, we left.

1565
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:55,041
Birdie came back later on to check.
It was the same thing.

1566
01:32:55,125 --> 01:32:58,125
- Where the hell were you, Andi?
- What time did you get there?

1567
01:32:58,708 --> 01:33:00,166
I don't know. It was dark.

1568
01:33:01,666 --> 01:33:02,500
And, Duke,

1569
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:05,166
you were already there?

1570
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:07,333
He almost got in an accident
on his motorcycle,

1571
01:33:07,416 --> 01:33:08,541
he was driving so fast.

1572
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:09,875
Andi, I almost got pancaked.

1573
01:33:09,958 --> 01:33:13,208
Okay, okay. Can you say all that
one more time for me, please?

1574
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:17,958
Look.

1575
01:33:19,291 --> 01:33:22,083
I don't know what you're planning
on pulling being here,

1576
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:24,500
but we need to talk about this.

1577
01:33:25,583 --> 01:33:27,750
If I would've answered
the door that night,

1578
01:33:28,875 --> 01:33:32,333
would you have said,
"I'm sorry. I back you with Miles."

1579
01:33:33,666 --> 01:33:35,625
Or were you just showing up

1580
01:33:35,708 --> 01:33:38,250
so you could stop me
from using that envelope?

1581
01:33:53,083 --> 01:33:54,208
Something's off.

1582
01:33:55,041 --> 01:33:56,166
I don't like it.

1583
01:33:57,208 --> 01:33:58,583
What's she playing at?

1584
01:34:02,583 --> 01:34:05,208
<i>Please, keep our water clean. Please…</i>

1585
01:34:05,291 --> 01:34:06,291
Blanc!

1586
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:08,916
<i>Please, keep our water clean.</i>

1587
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,583
That's everything she said, I think.

1588
01:34:11,666 --> 01:34:14,875
I think maybe you should take up drinking.
You're just killing it.

1589
01:34:14,958 --> 01:34:20,250
Lionel and Claire were never there alone.
But Duke came early and Birdie came late.

1590
01:34:20,333 --> 01:34:22,791
But they could've gotten there early,
killed your sister,

1591
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:25,916
circled away and then waited
for the other to arrive.

1592
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,166
Shit.

1593
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:30,583
Something is just teasing the edge
of my brain.

1594
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:33,791
This… this case confounds me.
It just confounds me.

1595
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:37,333
We don't have a motive
for Duke or Birdie, so — 

1596
01:34:37,416 --> 01:34:39,958
<i>Do either of you two
want to do a session or what?</i>

1597
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:41,750
<i>I'm on the clock.</i>

1598
01:34:44,208 --> 01:34:46,708
No, not right now.

1599
01:34:49,541 --> 01:34:50,541
Maybe later.

1600
01:34:50,625 --> 01:34:52,500
<i>All right. It's your money, not mine.</i>

1601
01:34:57,250 --> 01:35:03,333
Ugh. Oh, if I ever meet Jared Leto,
I'm gonna whoop his kombucha-brewing ass.

1602
01:35:03,416 --> 01:35:06,041
One number. All his machines.

1603
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:10,625
Holy shit.

1604
01:35:10,708 --> 01:35:14,375
From that afternoon,
just minutes after Andi sent the email.

1605
01:35:15,041 --> 01:35:16,875
Lionel. Lionel faxed it — 

1606
01:35:16,958 --> 01:35:19,666
Now hold on, it doesn't
necessarily mean he… Get down.

1607
01:35:20,291 --> 01:35:22,958
Right now. Go to him.
Do what you gotta do,

1608
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:26,125
push that son of a bitch.
Just get an answer out of him.

1609
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:31,750
Look, babe. We really need this.
So do this for me one last time, okay?

1610
01:35:33,333 --> 01:35:35,583
All right. I love —

1611
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:55,583
Come here.

1612
01:36:09,125 --> 01:36:10,500
Are you gonna do it for me?

1613
01:36:10,583 --> 01:36:12,250
Mm-hmm.

1614
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,333
Not that.

1615
01:36:14,833 --> 01:36:16,083
- Hmm?
- Huh-uh.

1616
01:36:16,666 --> 01:36:18,000
Oh, come on, come on.

1617
01:36:18,083 --> 01:36:20,041
It's all he wants.

1618
01:36:20,125 --> 01:36:22,625
The YouTube channel's dying.
He needs the exposure.

1619
01:36:22,708 --> 01:36:26,958
Just put him on Alpha News, baby.
Just a late-night spot.

1620
01:36:27,041 --> 01:36:30,208
And you know he's earned it.
With what he did.

1621
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:31,500
Listen, listen.

1622
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:33,875
I am building the future of news.

1623
01:36:33,958 --> 01:36:37,291
I can't have
rhino-horn-boner-pill karma in the mix.

1624
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:39,375
See? See?

1625
01:36:40,166 --> 01:36:45,333
Like, he is my loyal friend,
but I can't put him on Alpha News. Okay?

1626
01:36:54,791 --> 01:36:57,041
There's no stopping it, Peg.

1627
01:36:57,125 --> 01:36:58,833
I can't do this anymore. I'm done.

1628
01:36:58,916 --> 01:37:00,791
- Peg!
- Don't. Just don't talk to me!

1629
01:37:00,875 --> 01:37:03,500
- Wait! Peg!
- Ten years! Ten years!

1630
01:37:03,583 --> 01:37:05,375
My therapist says
this is a toxic relationship.

1631
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:07,833
- Don't be like that!
- Don't follow me. Birdie!

1632
01:37:07,916 --> 01:37:09,375
I quit! I quit!

1633
01:37:12,208 --> 01:37:14,666
<i>It was a tribute to Beyoncé,
but people…</i>

1634
01:37:16,166 --> 01:37:18,625
<i>What did Miles mean,
"This is her only chance"?</i>

1635
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:20,583
<i>What does anything mean?</i>

1636
01:37:20,666 --> 01:37:23,125
<i>I swear to God,
I'll punch you in the face if you do not…</i>

1637
01:37:23,208 --> 01:37:24,166
…tell me!

1638
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:26,833
I am going to sign the statement.

1639
01:37:26,916 --> 01:37:28,958
No! That will destroy us.
There's no coming — 

1640
01:37:29,041 --> 01:37:31,541
The story is gonna break!
There's no stopping it!

1641
01:37:31,625 --> 01:37:33,583
We will do what we always do.

1642
01:37:33,666 --> 01:37:36,916
Deny, half-apologize,
and then go silent awhile.

1643
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,208
I will handle this. You…

1644
01:37:41,708 --> 01:37:42,583
What is this?

1645
01:37:43,416 --> 01:37:44,500
It's my secret phone.

1646
01:37:47,166 --> 01:37:48,083
What is this?

1647
01:37:48,666 --> 01:37:51,791
An email from the Sweetie Pants contractor
two years ago.

1648
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,625
"Miss Jay, I'm writing to inform you
that the proposed Bangladesh factory

1649
01:37:57,708 --> 01:38:00,583
is notoriously one of the world's
biggest sweatshops."

1650
01:38:00,666 --> 01:38:01,833
"Please advise."

1651
01:38:03,291 --> 01:38:07,375
And then you replied,
"Sounds perfect. Thanks."

1652
01:38:08,958 --> 01:38:10,791
With your Memoji dabbing.

1653
01:38:15,916 --> 01:38:16,916
Birdie,

1654
01:38:18,916 --> 01:38:23,666
please tell me you did not think
sweatshops are where they make

1655
01:38:25,416 --> 01:38:27,000
sweatpants.

1656
01:38:30,166 --> 01:38:32,208
Oh my God.

1657
01:38:32,291 --> 01:38:34,666
Miles is going to pay me off.

1658
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:37,333
He said if I take full responsibility
for the sweatshops,

1659
01:38:37,416 --> 01:38:39,666
he'll pay me the value of my shares.

1660
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:40,916
Thirty million.

1661
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:44,041
I will do whatever I have to do
to save myself,

1662
01:38:44,125 --> 01:38:46,500
and he is my only lifeline.

1663
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:49,416
- <i>Can I have my secret phone back?</i>
- No.

1664
01:38:51,791 --> 01:38:53,125
This never happens in <i>Clue.</i>

1665
01:38:53,208 --> 01:38:54,958
That's because it's a terrible game.

1666
01:38:55,041 --> 01:38:57,125
They all had a motive to protect Miles.

1667
01:38:57,208 --> 01:38:59,916
They were all there that night.
So what now, detective?

1668
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:01,833
The envelope.

1669
01:39:02,833 --> 01:39:06,708
Whoever killed your sister
took that envelope to protect Miles,

1670
01:39:06,791 --> 01:39:08,500
and they wouldn't just destroy it.

1671
01:39:08,583 --> 01:39:10,916
They would want him to see
what they'd done for him.

1672
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,875
They brought it here. It's here.

1673
01:39:14,458 --> 01:39:16,250
So how are we supposed to find it?

1674
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:18,791
Well, unless someone brings
an attaché case to dinner,

1675
01:39:18,875 --> 01:39:21,958
they won't have an envelope
that size on their person.

1676
01:39:24,666 --> 01:39:26,583
They'll have to hide it in their room.

1677
01:39:27,583 --> 01:39:29,541
So, at dinner tonight…

1678
01:39:29,625 --> 01:39:32,291
Andi. I'm hoping it's still whiskey soda.

1679
01:39:32,875 --> 01:39:35,666
<i>You need to keep your head clear
and stay sharp.</i>

1680
01:39:37,208 --> 01:39:38,958
<i>Because you have to find a way.</i>

1681
01:39:39,041 --> 01:39:40,583
I want the truth!

1682
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I can give you that.

1683
01:39:44,083 --> 01:39:47,000
<i>A way that is
so painfully uncomfortable</i>

1684
01:39:47,083 --> 01:39:49,375
<i>that nobody will question it
or follow you.</i>

1685
01:39:50,083 --> 01:39:52,041
- <i>Pick a fight. And lose.</i>
- I'm tired of pretending.

1686
01:39:52,125 --> 01:39:54,250
<i>We have to find that envelope.</i>

1687
01:39:54,333 --> 01:39:56,750
You're the loser. That's the truth.

1688
01:40:02,625 --> 01:40:04,208
There she is. There's the Andi I know.

1689
01:40:07,708 --> 01:40:10,708
He's a son of a bitch, Whiskey.
Leave his ass.

1690
01:40:27,291 --> 01:40:30,541
<i>Search their rooms.
Ransack them, fast and thorough.</i>

1691
01:40:32,458 --> 01:40:34,166
<i>Don't worry about being neat.</i>

1692
01:41:04,875 --> 01:41:05,708
Hey.

1693
01:41:06,541 --> 01:41:08,666
Hi. Sorry.

1694
01:41:12,916 --> 01:41:14,500
Want to hang out or…

1695
01:41:18,541 --> 01:41:19,375
Damn it.

1696
01:41:21,416 --> 01:41:22,625
What the hell?

1697
01:41:36,916 --> 01:41:40,000
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1698
01:41:53,708 --> 01:41:54,541
Andi?

1699
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:56,416
<i>Dong!</i>

1700
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:57,916
I can explain this.

1701
01:41:58,625 --> 01:41:59,541
Huh?

1702
01:42:00,791 --> 01:42:03,125
Wait a minute. Whiskey, is the party over?

1703
01:42:03,208 --> 01:42:05,625
No. No. I left.

1704
01:42:07,041 --> 01:42:08,791
Duke…

1705
01:42:08,875 --> 01:42:12,666
I left Duke because I couldn't…
He didn't deserve this.

1706
01:42:13,541 --> 01:42:15,208
How am I going to tell his mom?

1707
01:42:15,291 --> 01:42:19,750
Hey, hey, hey. Yes, he did.
Okay? He is a bastard.

1708
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:21,666
I don't feel sorry for him.

1709
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:25,791
He deserved what he got,
and you are better off without him.

1710
01:42:34,375 --> 01:42:36,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1711
01:42:36,833 --> 01:42:37,958
What the fuck?

1712
01:42:39,958 --> 01:42:42,458
Please don't kill me!
Oh my God, please don't kill me!

1713
01:42:42,541 --> 01:42:44,625
I'm not trying to kill you,
you crazy bitch!

1714
01:43:11,666 --> 01:43:12,791
Andi?

1715
01:43:16,333 --> 01:43:17,166
Andi!

1716
01:43:17,666 --> 01:43:18,500
Blanc!

1717
01:43:27,875 --> 01:43:29,958
Blanc, where are you? Where are you?

1718
01:43:30,041 --> 01:43:33,416
Helen! Listen, there's great danger.
Did you take Duke's gun?

1719
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:36,083
Why would I take Duke's gun?
And why are the lights out?

1720
01:43:36,166 --> 01:43:37,125
Duke is dead.

1721
01:43:37,208 --> 01:43:38,333
What?

1722
01:43:38,416 --> 01:43:40,541
No time. Did you find the envelope?

1723
01:43:40,625 --> 01:43:43,291
No, I searched every room. It's not there.

1724
01:43:43,375 --> 01:43:46,916
Oh, I've been a fool!
There's one more room to search.

1725
01:43:48,041 --> 01:43:50,750
They already gave it to Miles.
It's in the Glass Onion.

1726
01:43:50,833 --> 01:43:53,458
If I can distract everyone,
and you can get up there and find it — 

1727
01:43:53,541 --> 01:43:55,750
No, but that doesn't tell us
who gave it to him.

1728
01:43:56,333 --> 01:43:57,958
Blanc, I don't understand.

1729
01:43:58,041 --> 01:44:00,750
Please. Trust me. It's all in plain sight.

1730
01:44:01,541 --> 01:44:04,625
We only need one last piece
of information, but only you can — 

1731
01:44:27,541 --> 01:44:29,333
Son of a bitch!

1732
01:44:49,291 --> 01:44:51,250
Blanc, go chase him!

1733
01:44:52,416 --> 01:44:54,250
What are you doing?
Don't let him get away.

1734
01:45:11,791 --> 01:45:13,583
The killer thinks you're dead.

1735
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:15,625
This is our cover.

1736
01:45:16,916 --> 01:45:20,833
I can buy you maybe five minutes alone
in the Glass Onion, but you have to — 

1737
01:45:20,916 --> 01:45:23,208
- Give me that.
- You have to find that envelope.

1738
01:45:23,291 --> 01:45:24,833
- I will.
- That's it…

1739
01:45:24,916 --> 01:45:26,791
Oh, no, give me that. Give me that.

1740
01:45:28,666 --> 01:45:29,750
This'll be good.

1741
01:45:33,625 --> 01:45:35,500
Oh. Oh. Oh!

1742
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:37,583
Shitballs!

1743
01:45:37,666 --> 01:45:38,750
Blanc…

1744
01:45:41,583 --> 01:45:42,458
Yes.

1745
01:45:50,833 --> 01:45:51,875
Oh, God.

1746
01:45:59,791 --> 01:46:00,916
God, Andi.

1747
01:46:01,875 --> 01:46:03,791
Everyone, inside right now.

1748
01:46:03,875 --> 01:46:06,375
- Shouldn't we — 
- She's not going anywhere.

1749
01:46:06,458 --> 01:46:08,416
Inside.

1750
01:46:10,166 --> 01:46:11,916
It's time to finish this.

1751
01:46:20,208 --> 01:46:21,208
Shitballs.

1752
01:46:22,708 --> 01:46:24,375
It makes no sense.

1753
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:26,083
This makes perfect sense.

1754
01:46:26,166 --> 01:46:28,458
Duke, Andi, this weekend,

1755
01:46:28,541 --> 01:46:32,333
this ridiculous game that started
well before we set foot on this island.

1756
01:46:32,416 --> 01:46:34,750
Will you explain it
to us all then, detective?

1757
01:46:34,833 --> 01:46:38,500
No, I can peel back the layers,

1758
01:46:38,583 --> 01:46:42,958
I can take it to a point,
but what lies at the center,

1759
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:48,625
only one person can tell us
who killed Cassandra Brand.

1760
01:46:50,750 --> 01:46:51,583
Who?

1761
01:46:54,083 --> 01:46:59,416
Well, I keep returning,
in my mind, to the Glass Onion.

1762
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:06,416
<i>Something that seems densely layered,
mysterious and inscrutable.</i>

1763
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:09,125
<i>But in fact, the center is in plain sight.</i>

1764
01:47:09,208 --> 01:47:10,625
Where? Where?

1765
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:15,041
And that is why this case
has confounded me like no other.

1766
01:47:15,125 --> 01:47:20,041
Why every complex layer
peeled back has revealed

1767
01:47:20,125 --> 01:47:25,000
another layer and another layer
and come to naught.

1768
01:47:25,541 --> 01:47:28,333
And that was the problem, right there.

1769
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:34,208
<i>You see, I expected complexity.</i>

1770
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:39,791
<i>I expected intelligence.
I expected a puzzle, a game.</i>

1771
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:43,875
<i>But that's not what any of this is.</i>

1772
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:48,708
<i>It hides not behind complexity,</i>

1773
01:47:48,791 --> 01:47:53,041
<i>but behind mind-numbing obvious clarity.</i>

1774
01:47:55,833 --> 01:47:58,166
<i>Truth is, it doesn't hide at all.</i>

1775
01:47:59,791 --> 01:48:01,583
<i>I was staring right at it.</i>

1776
01:48:15,833 --> 01:48:19,166
The killer nearly struck
my Achilles' heel.

1777
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:22,291
But thank high heaven, at the last moment,

1778
01:48:22,375 --> 01:48:28,750
I realized what had teased my brain
through this entire case…

1779
01:48:32,041 --> 01:48:33,333
"Inbreathiate."

1780
01:48:36,458 --> 01:48:37,500
It's not a word.

1781
01:48:38,375 --> 01:48:39,291
What?

1782
01:48:39,375 --> 01:48:42,750
Can we just take a second
and fully inbreathiate this moment?

1783
01:48:43,333 --> 01:48:44,625
It's not a real word.

1784
01:48:44,708 --> 01:48:47,666
It kind of sounds like one,
but it's just entirely made up.

1785
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:49,333
Now "reclamation,"

1786
01:48:49,416 --> 01:48:50,500
now, well, that…

1787
01:48:50,583 --> 01:48:54,416
That is a word, but it's the wrong word.

1788
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:58,125
This place is the full reclamation
of everything I've achieved up to now.

1789
01:48:58,208 --> 01:48:59,416
This entire day…

1790
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:00,666
The predefinite detective.

1791
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:04,208
A veritable minefield of malapropisms…

1792
01:49:04,291 --> 01:49:05,250
The infraction point.

1793
01:49:05,333 --> 01:49:07,041
…and factual errors.

1794
01:49:07,125 --> 01:49:09,208
Bask in the sun, swim in the Ionian Sea.

1795
01:49:09,833 --> 01:49:11,875
That is the Aegean Sea.

1796
01:49:11,958 --> 01:49:15,041
Oh, yeah, it is. It is.

1797
01:49:15,125 --> 01:49:20,250
His dock doesn't float.
His wonder-fuel is a disaster.

1798
01:49:20,333 --> 01:49:24,000
His grasp of disruption theory
is remedial at best.

1799
01:49:24,083 --> 01:49:27,208
He didn't design the puzzle boxes.
He didn't write the mystery.

1800
01:49:27,291 --> 01:49:32,291
<i>Et voilà!</i> It all adds up.
The key to this entire case.

1801
01:49:33,125 --> 01:49:35,125
And it was staring me right in the face.

1802
01:49:36,458 --> 01:49:38,791
Like everyone in the world,

1803
01:49:38,875 --> 01:49:43,041
I assumed Miles Bron was
a complicated genius.

1804
01:49:43,125 --> 01:49:44,291
But why?

1805
01:49:45,833 --> 01:49:49,875
Look into the clear center
of this Glass Onion…

1806
01:49:52,541 --> 01:49:54,291
Miles Bron is an idiot.

1807
01:49:56,125 --> 01:50:01,541
Oh, please.
Just tell us who tried to kill me.

1808
01:50:01,625 --> 01:50:06,416
Nobody tried to kill you,
you vainglorious buffoon.

1809
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:09,083
Duke took my glass!

1810
01:50:09,166 --> 01:50:11,041
That's what you told us he did.

1811
01:50:11,958 --> 01:50:15,625
He must've picked it up by mistake,
you told us, right after it happened.

1812
01:50:15,708 --> 01:50:19,291
Look at that dress spin.
Birdie, do that again. Watch this.

1813
01:50:19,375 --> 01:50:21,333
And after you said those words,

1814
01:50:21,416 --> 01:50:24,291
that's what we all remember seeing,
but think!

1815
01:50:25,625 --> 01:50:29,291
Ignore his lies, everyone,
and think clearly now.

1816
01:50:29,375 --> 01:50:32,291
What did we all actually see?

1817
01:50:32,375 --> 01:50:35,208
Wow! Look at that dress spin.
Birdie, that's amazing.

1818
01:50:35,291 --> 01:50:36,333
Just…

1819
01:50:36,416 --> 01:50:40,416
You handed Duke your own glass.

1820
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:42,875
Clear as crystal.
Right in front of our eyes.

1821
01:50:42,958 --> 01:50:46,666
All of us.
And then told a bald-faced fabrication.

1822
01:50:47,458 --> 01:50:48,625
And it worked.

1823
01:50:49,208 --> 01:50:51,583
Blanc, are you telling us
Miles killed Duke?

1824
01:50:51,666 --> 01:50:53,625
- Yes.
- Why?

1825
01:50:53,708 --> 01:50:56,291
Because the night
Andi sent you all the emails,

1826
01:50:56,375 --> 01:50:59,041
when Duke got to Andi's house
early on his motorcycle…

1827
01:51:01,416 --> 01:51:03,041
…<i>he saw Miles leaving.</i>

1828
01:51:06,958 --> 01:51:08,333
<i> Was almost struck by him.</i>

1829
01:51:08,416 --> 01:51:12,041
<i>In fact, he told all of us.
Right out in the open, he told us.</i>

1830
01:51:12,125 --> 01:51:13,541
Iconic.

1831
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:17,291
Remember that night you almost pancaked me
with it on the road outside of Andi's?

1832
01:51:17,375 --> 01:51:19,250
Anderson Cooper's birthday? Mm-hmm.

1833
01:51:19,333 --> 01:51:21,833
That night, at Andi's.

1834
01:51:22,416 --> 01:51:25,583
That night, Duke told us
he almost got in an accident.

1835
01:51:25,666 --> 01:51:27,083
He… pancaked?

1836
01:51:27,166 --> 01:51:30,250
Yeah, but Miles had been living in Greece
the past six months.

1837
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:32,125
No. Whiskey.

1838
01:51:33,416 --> 01:51:36,458
Miles saw you
on your birthday in New York.

1839
01:51:36,541 --> 01:51:40,125
Gave you that necklace for your birthday.
And you're a Taurus.

1840
01:51:41,125 --> 01:51:42,208
I am.

1841
01:51:43,375 --> 01:51:44,875
Two weeks ago.

1842
01:51:44,958 --> 01:51:47,125
- Forget the hydrofuels…
- May 9th.

1843
01:51:47,208 --> 01:51:48,125
…and the sweatshops,

1844
01:51:48,208 --> 01:51:51,166
and the consensual cuckolding
for cable news assignments.

1845
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:52,083
Sorry, what?

1846
01:51:52,166 --> 01:51:53,333
And focus

1847
01:51:55,208 --> 01:51:56,291
on the envelope.

1848
01:52:04,541 --> 01:52:06,791
Holy shit!

1849
01:52:10,875 --> 01:52:12,916
What is reality?

1850
01:52:14,208 --> 01:52:15,291
Andi?

1851
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:21,458
Who did the envelope threaten?

1852
01:52:24,541 --> 01:52:25,666
Miles Bron.

1853
01:52:28,083 --> 01:52:33,916
<i>That night, Lionel faxed Andi's email
to Miles who received it in New York.</i>

1854
01:52:34,625 --> 01:52:37,916
<i>The one thing that could
destroy his empire of lies,</i>

1855
01:52:38,666 --> 01:52:42,791
<i>the truth in the hands of
the only person unafraid to tell it.</i>

1856
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:47,458
<i>So Miles drives his Baby Blue Porsche</i>

1857
01:52:47,541 --> 01:52:50,708
<i>to the scene of the crime,
and Andi lets him in.</i>

1858
01:52:50,791 --> 01:52:51,916
<i>Of course she did.</i>

1859
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,833
<i>Miles' machine of lawyers and power</i>

1860
01:52:54,916 --> 01:52:58,166
<i>could destroy her
through sheer dumb force.</i>

1861
01:52:58,250 --> 01:52:59,791
<i>But Miles himself?</i>

1862
01:52:59,875 --> 01:53:02,250
<i>Oh, she was clever enough
not to fear Miles.</i>

1863
01:53:03,916 --> 01:53:10,208
<i>But she didn't see the real threat,
the obvious threat until it was too late.</i>

1864
01:53:20,291 --> 01:53:24,208
Duke alone knew you were there that night,
but he didn't know Andi was dead.

1865
01:53:24,291 --> 01:53:27,750
No, no, he didn't know that
until this evening.

1866
01:53:27,833 --> 01:53:32,000
Right here, when he got
a Google Alert on his phone,

1867
01:53:32,083 --> 01:53:35,125
which has now fallen strangely silent.

1868
01:53:35,625 --> 01:53:37,000
And which he showed to you…

1869
01:53:39,291 --> 01:53:41,458
…because you don't own a phone.

1870
01:53:42,041 --> 01:53:43,750
Duke! No!

1871
01:53:48,458 --> 01:53:50,375
Did he really think
he could stop all of them

1872
01:53:50,458 --> 01:53:52,208
from finding out about Andi's death?

1873
01:53:52,291 --> 01:53:53,958
They all have phones.

1874
01:53:54,041 --> 01:53:55,458
- Where's my phone?
- Peggy.

1875
01:53:56,250 --> 01:53:57,791
- Phone!
- Still no.

1876
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,416
He didn't need to hide the death.

1877
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:03,166
He just needed to hide
that Duke had shown him the death

1878
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:05,541
<i>moments before he was killed.</i>

1879
01:54:06,541 --> 01:54:08,541
<i>Right out in the open, Duke showed him.</i>

1880
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:10,333
That changes things, right?

1881
01:54:10,416 --> 01:54:11,833
It sure does.

1882
01:54:11,916 --> 01:54:15,000
And told him exactly what he wanted
in return for his silence.

1883
01:54:15,083 --> 01:54:18,375
Numbers like this.
Maybe we can talk Alpha News?

1884
01:54:19,208 --> 01:54:21,208
You bet your ass. Come here.

1885
01:54:22,041 --> 01:54:23,541
So what does Miles do?

1886
01:54:23,625 --> 01:54:25,750
Does he keep a vial of poison
in his tooth or something?

1887
01:54:25,833 --> 01:54:26,916
Is that a rich person thing?

1888
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:31,666
No, no, no, no, it's just…
It's so much stupider than that.

1889
01:54:31,750 --> 01:54:34,666
Birdie, what are the ingredients
to your Cuban Breeze?

1890
01:54:35,291 --> 01:54:38,208
Um, vodka, amaretto.

1891
01:54:38,291 --> 01:54:39,125
Oh, God.

1892
01:54:44,875 --> 01:54:46,708
<i>And… pineapple juice.</i>

1893
01:54:46,791 --> 01:54:49,458
No pineapple in that, right?
Duke don't dance with pineapple.

1894
01:54:50,041 --> 01:54:51,208
An allergy.

1895
01:54:51,291 --> 01:54:52,791
He can't even have a drop.

1896
01:54:52,875 --> 01:54:54,333
Pineapple juice!

1897
01:54:54,833 --> 01:54:58,041
He just put pineapple juice in his whiskey.

1898
01:54:58,958 --> 01:55:00,375
It's so dumb.

1899
01:55:00,458 --> 01:55:02,791
Oh, it's so dumb, it's brilliant.

1900
01:55:02,875 --> 01:55:05,666
No! It's just dumb!

1901
01:55:06,541 --> 01:55:09,916
"Died of an apparent suicide.
She is survived by her sister, Helen."

1902
01:55:11,208 --> 01:55:12,083
Helen.

1903
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,500
You told me about Helen, your sister — 

1904
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,916
Oh, wait!

1905
01:55:21,875 --> 01:55:24,291
Helen Brand, ladies and gentlemen.

1906
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,416
And now we come
to Helen's attempted murder,

1907
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:36,750
which, I have to give you credit for,
did have a sound foundation of thought.

1908
01:55:37,833 --> 01:55:41,333
You realized the opportunity
laid out in front of you.

1909
01:55:41,416 --> 01:55:43,333
You have a house on a remote island,

1910
01:55:43,416 --> 01:55:46,333
<i>filled with desperate people,</i>

1911
01:55:46,416 --> 01:55:51,333
all of whom have a real-life reason
to wish this woman harm. You — 

1912
01:55:56,166 --> 01:56:02,500
Furthermore, you have
a loaded gun conveniently within reach.

1913
01:56:05,583 --> 01:56:08,916
And the lights had even been turned off.

1914
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,500
You've taken seven people,

1915
01:56:10,583 --> 01:56:13,208
each of whom has a real-life reason
to wish you harm,

1916
01:56:13,291 --> 01:56:15,583
gathered them together on a remote island,

1917
01:56:15,666 --> 01:56:19,125
and placed the idea
of your murder in their heads.

1918
01:56:19,208 --> 01:56:23,166
It's like putting a loaded gun
on the table and turning off the lights!

1919
01:56:25,083 --> 01:56:26,166
Heavens to…

1920
01:56:27,291 --> 01:56:29,750
You dim-witted, brainless

1921
01:56:30,416 --> 01:56:31,833
jackass!

1922
01:56:32,958 --> 01:56:36,666
Your one murder, with any panache at all,

1923
01:56:37,583 --> 01:56:41,458
and you stole the whole idea from me.

1924
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,958
And after all that, you…
You still kept the envelope?

1925
01:57:00,875 --> 01:57:02,500
You didn't burn it or anything?

1926
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,500
You recognize this?

1927
01:57:06,625 --> 01:57:08,333
Andi's handwriting.

1928
01:57:09,666 --> 01:57:11,166
I got you, son of a bitch.

1929
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:14,541
Oh, let's slow down there, sister. Okay?

1930
01:57:14,625 --> 01:57:18,375
Because first, how could you
ever prove that that's the original?

1931
01:57:18,458 --> 01:57:20,125
- She might have copied mine.
- No.

1932
01:57:21,041 --> 01:57:23,541
The bar closed nine years ago,

1933
01:57:23,625 --> 01:57:26,625
and hers has one thing
that yours just doesn't.

1934
01:57:34,583 --> 01:57:36,875
Okay, but second…

1935
01:57:45,916 --> 01:57:48,291
- What the hell did he do?
- He just burned it!

1936
01:57:48,375 --> 01:57:50,375
Burned what?
I didn't see anything.

1937
01:57:50,458 --> 01:57:51,416
You burned it!

1938
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:54,041
- Is someone making toast?
- This will not stand.

1939
01:57:54,125 --> 01:57:59,708
Uh-huh. Well, did you see this proof,
this smoking napkin, Blanc?

1940
01:58:01,166 --> 01:58:03,333
No. Did anybody?

1941
01:58:08,583 --> 01:58:10,208
Okay, then wow!

1942
01:58:10,916 --> 01:58:13,750
Wow! We got some big accusations
flying around here.

1943
01:58:14,458 --> 01:58:16,541
Except, everybody seems to have

1944
01:58:16,625 --> 01:58:19,125
a very foggy recollection
of what they actually saw,

1945
01:58:19,208 --> 01:58:22,541
and there's nothing
but totally circumspective evidence.

1946
01:58:23,541 --> 01:58:27,541
So, if this was just us
playing my murder mystery game,

1947
01:58:27,625 --> 01:58:30,083
which we should have been doing
all weekend,

1948
01:58:30,166 --> 01:58:33,583
then Blanc wins an iPad Pro this time.

1949
01:58:34,625 --> 01:58:36,000
But this is the real world.

1950
01:58:36,666 --> 01:58:40,375
And in the real world, you need
more than a neat, little detective story.

1951
01:58:40,458 --> 01:58:41,958
You need evidence.

1952
01:58:42,041 --> 01:58:45,166
And you've got… nothing.

1953
01:58:45,875 --> 01:58:46,875
Do you?

1954
01:58:54,416 --> 01:58:55,416
He's right.

1955
01:58:57,250 --> 01:59:00,250
The contents of that envelope
and his possession of it

1956
01:59:00,333 --> 01:59:02,583
were our only physical evidence.

1957
01:59:04,375 --> 01:59:05,458
Right.

1958
01:59:08,208 --> 01:59:12,125
Wanna take that to the cops?
You wanna take it to the courts?

1959
01:59:13,458 --> 01:59:15,666
Look, you pick your poison.

1960
01:59:16,291 --> 01:59:20,416
Anywhere you go,
it's going to be your word against mine.

1961
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:22,916
How do you think that's gonna go?

1962
01:59:23,708 --> 01:59:27,416
I think it's gonna go
about like it went for Andi.

1963
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:28,916
Jesus.

1964
01:59:31,541 --> 01:59:33,666
And, I do want to say,

1965
01:59:34,541 --> 01:59:38,333
your sister was a complicated woman,
but she meant the world to me.

1966
01:59:39,791 --> 01:59:41,375
And I'm so sorry for your loss.

1967
01:59:50,916 --> 01:59:52,166
Nobody's stepping up?

1968
01:59:56,125 --> 01:59:58,583
Raise your hand
and say, "I saw him take Duke's gun."

1969
02:00:02,375 --> 02:00:04,416
"I saw him that night at Andi's house."

1970
02:00:10,291 --> 02:00:12,541
"I saw the napkin before he burned it."

1971
02:00:13,333 --> 02:00:14,208
We didn't…

1972
02:00:16,791 --> 02:00:18,000
We… We didn't.

1973
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:24,416
You would lie for a lie,
but you won't lie for the truth.

1974
02:00:26,333 --> 02:00:28,583
You're still holding on to his titties.

1975
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,583
You shitheads.

1976
02:00:37,375 --> 02:00:38,250
Blanc.

1977
02:00:40,208 --> 02:00:41,708
I need you to do something.

1978
02:00:44,291 --> 02:00:46,125
I'm sorry, Helen.

1979
02:00:46,791 --> 02:00:48,333
I gave you the truth.

1980
02:00:49,583 --> 02:00:51,875
This is where my jurisdiction ends.

1981
02:00:53,041 --> 02:00:56,375
I have to answer to the police,
the courts, the system.

1982
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:00,416
There's nothing I can do.

1983
02:01:04,916 --> 02:01:05,958
Except maybe…

1984
02:01:08,166 --> 02:01:09,916
offer you some courage.

1985
02:01:13,083 --> 02:01:17,166
And a reminder of why your sister
walked away in the first place.

1986
02:02:31,166 --> 02:02:32,291
Hell, yeah!

1987
02:02:37,458 --> 02:02:38,375
Why the hell not?

1988
02:02:38,458 --> 02:02:40,833
Yeah, go, Helen! All right, go, Helen!

1989
02:02:54,708 --> 02:02:56,416
God damn, that felt good.

1990
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,916
Oh, really?

1991
02:03:03,333 --> 02:03:04,833
- You want to join in?
- Yeah.

1992
02:03:04,916 --> 02:03:05,833
- Oh, yeah.
- You go.

1993
02:03:05,916 --> 02:03:07,333
Yeah, we should… Hey, Miles!

1994
02:03:13,875 --> 02:03:14,708
Okay.

1995
02:03:22,666 --> 02:03:25,416
I get it, guys. Let it all out.

1996
02:03:27,458 --> 02:03:29,166
Yes! Whoo!

1997
02:03:34,458 --> 02:03:36,458
Yay! Mazel tov!

1998
02:03:41,291 --> 02:03:43,250
Ooh, coming in real hot.

1999
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,958
Helen, easy!

2000
02:03:45,916 --> 02:03:46,833
Whoa!

2001
02:03:47,958 --> 02:03:50,083
I think that belonged to Liberace.

2002
02:03:50,166 --> 02:03:52,250
Okay, I… Are we done?

2003
02:03:54,958 --> 02:03:56,000
Whoa, whoa.

2004
02:03:56,083 --> 02:03:58,000
- We're not done.
- Whoa, whoa.

2005
02:04:00,083 --> 02:04:00,958
Why are you — 

2006
02:04:01,041 --> 02:04:01,916
Ooh.

2007
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,750
Okay. What?

2008
02:04:11,250 --> 02:04:13,125
What? What is it? What do you want?

2009
02:04:20,875 --> 02:04:21,916
We're not — 

2010
02:04:23,333 --> 02:04:26,125
Oh my God! Whoa!

2011
02:04:31,166 --> 02:04:34,041
Miles! Fire extinguisher. Miles?

2012
02:04:34,125 --> 02:04:35,083
Andi?

2013
02:04:36,541 --> 02:04:37,625
Uh, Helen!

2014
02:04:37,708 --> 02:04:39,916
- Fire extinguisher?
- Wait — 

2015
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,875
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

2016
02:04:42,958 --> 02:04:44,583
Helen, God damn it!

2017
02:04:45,250 --> 02:04:46,708
Come on, Helen!

2018
02:04:49,416 --> 02:04:52,041
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

2019
02:04:54,125 --> 02:04:55,250
Okay, stop!

2020
02:04:56,333 --> 02:04:58,208
Stop. Enough.

2021
02:05:08,833 --> 02:05:10,583
Helen, walk away.

2022
02:05:11,875 --> 02:05:13,125
Yeah.

2023
02:05:13,208 --> 02:05:16,458
With a reminder of why my sister
walked away in the first place.

2024
02:05:40,083 --> 02:05:41,666
Oh, shit!

2025
02:05:48,333 --> 02:05:49,875
Hindenburg.

2026
02:06:00,333 --> 02:06:03,083
<i>This is a smokeless garden.</i>

02:06:03,166 --> 02:06:05,375
<i>This is a smokeless garden.</i>

2028
02:06:06,250 --> 02:06:11,041
<i>This is a smokeless garden.
This is a smokeless garden.</i>

2029
02:06:11,125 --> 02:06:12,083
Disruption.

2030
02:06:12,166 --> 02:06:13,875
<i>This is a smokeless garden.</i>

2031
02:06:13,958 --> 02:06:14,791
Fuckin' A.

2032
02:08:27,916 --> 02:08:32,041
Oh, fantastic! Oh, that's so punk rock!

2033
02:08:32,666 --> 02:08:34,500
What? You think you're an alligator?

2034
02:08:34,583 --> 02:08:37,250
You think you popped me
like a gangster? No!

2035
02:08:37,958 --> 02:08:39,166
You baby!

2036
02:08:40,333 --> 02:08:41,833
You child!

2037
02:08:43,833 --> 02:08:44,833
You feel better now?

2038
02:08:45,875 --> 02:08:48,291
I hope your little bitch tantrum
gave you closure

2039
02:08:48,375 --> 02:08:50,875
'cause it accomplished nothing!

2040
02:08:52,416 --> 02:08:55,541
Your fuel of the future just barbecued

2041
02:08:55,625 --> 02:08:59,375
the world's most famous painting,
you dumbass.

2042
02:09:03,791 --> 02:09:07,000
Congratulations on
the public launch of Klear

2043
02:09:07,916 --> 02:09:11,833
and the end of Miles Bron.

2044
02:09:15,166 --> 02:09:18,875
You're ruined. And you did get your wish.

2045
02:09:20,041 --> 02:09:23,333
To forever be remembered
in the same breath…

2046
02:09:25,125 --> 02:09:26,916
as the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

2047
02:09:36,458 --> 02:09:39,166
No. No.

2048
02:09:40,083 --> 02:09:45,166
Gang? We all saw the same thing.
We know what happened. Am I right?

2049
02:09:48,083 --> 02:09:49,708
I saw the napkin he burned.

2050
02:09:53,208 --> 02:09:58,750
God, now that you mention it,
I clearly saw him grab Duke's gun.

2051
02:10:01,583 --> 02:10:04,833
I saw him driving away from Andi's house
the night she was killed.

2052
02:10:13,625 --> 02:10:14,458
Oh…

2053
02:10:15,833 --> 02:10:17,375
you shitheads.

2054
02:10:48,208 --> 02:10:49,791
Did you get the son of a bitch?

2055
02:10:51,625 --> 02:10:52,458
Yeah.

2056
02:10:54,708 --> 02:10:56,000
You ready to go home?
