1
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,880
- Mama!
- We know.

2
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,240
Jyn, gather your things.
It's time.

3
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,680
Hello?

4
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,880
Saw, it's Lyra.

5
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,560
It's happened. He's come for us.

6
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,320
You know what to do.

7
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,920
Jyn, come here.

8
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,840
Remember, whatever I do,

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,080
I do it to protect you.

10
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,880
Say you understand.

11
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,360
I understand.

12
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
I love you, Stardust.

13
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,080
I love you, too, Papa.

14
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,520
Galen.

15
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,520
Go.

16
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,760
Jyn.

17
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,160
You know where to go, don't you?

18
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,320
Trust the Force.

19
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,760
You're a hard man
to find, Galen.

20
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,200
But farming...

21
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,080
Really? Man of your talents?

22
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,600
It's a peaceful life.

23
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,240
It's lonely, I imagine.

24
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,960
Since Lyra died, yes.

25
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,200
My condolences.

26
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,440
Search the house.

27
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,360
What is it you want?

28
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,480
The work has stalled.
I need you to come back.

29
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,080
I won't do it, Krennic.

30
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,680
We were on the verge
of greatness.

31
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,440
We were this close

32
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,840
to providing peace and
security for the galaxy.

33
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,160
You're confusing
peace with terror.

34
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
Well,

35
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,960
you have to start somewhere.

36
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,000
I'd be of no help, Krennic.

37
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,840
My mind just isn't what it was.

38
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,600
I have trouble remembering.

39
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,000
Even simple things.

40
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,840
Galen...

41
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,520
You're an inspired scientist,
but you're a terrible liar.

42
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,320
Now, I admire the effort.

43
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,840
I really do.

44
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,840
Look, here's Lyra,
back from the dead.

45
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,880
It's a miracle.

46
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Stop!

47
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,880
Lyra, troublesome as ever.

48
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,840
You're not taking him.

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,080
No, of course I'm not.
I'm taking you all.

50
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,440
You'll all come. You, your
child. You'll all live in comfort.

51
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,440
As hostages.

52
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,000
As heroes of the Empire.

53
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,040
Lyra. Put it down.

54
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,720
Think very carefully.

55
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,880
You will never win. Do it.

56
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,960
Lyra!

57
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Lyra!

58
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,320
They have a child!

59
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,280
Find it!

60
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,160
My child!

61
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,000
Come.

62
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,200
Come.

63
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,680
We have a long ride ahead of us.

64
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,080
Check in security,

65
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,480
cell block 4227.

66
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,640
4227.

67
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,920
TK-62, XX-25900.

68
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,320
I was about to leave.

69
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,840
I came as fast as I could.

70
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,920
I have to get back on
board. Walk with me.

71
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Back to Jedha?

72
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,160
They'll leave without me.

73
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,200
Easy! You have news from Jedha.

74
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,760
Come on.

75
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,040
An Imperial pilot,
one of the cargo drivers

76
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,440
he defected yesterday.

77
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,200
He's telling people
they're making a weapon.

78
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,200
The kyber crystals,
that's what they're for.

79
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
What kind of weapon?

80
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,920
Look, I have to go.
What kind of weapon?

81
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,720
A planet killer!
That's what he called it!

82
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,800
A planet killer?

83
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,800
Someone named Erso sent him.
Some old friend of Saw's.

84
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,880
Galen Erso? Was it?

85
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,400
I don't know! They were
looking for Saw when we left.

86
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,600
Who else knows about this?

87
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,840
I have no idea.

88
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,280
It's all falling apart.

89
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,760
Saw's right.

90
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,000
There's spies everywhere.

91
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
What's all this?

92
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,720
Come on, let's see
some scandocs.

93
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,600
Yeah, of course.
Just... My gloves.

94
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,840
No!

95
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,760
What have you done?

96
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,680
Troopers down. Section 9.

97
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,120
Are you crazy?

98
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,080
I'll never climb
out of here. My arm!

99
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,320
Get out of the way.

100
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,480
Move! Move!

101
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,120
Hey. Calm down. Calm down.

102
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,880
It will be all right.

103
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,440
Sir.

104
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,840
Is that him?

105
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,480
He looks kind of different
to how I imagined.

106
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,120
On your feet!

107
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,960
It's the pilot... the defector.

108
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,600
Okay. So you're Saw Gerrera?

109
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
Saw Gerrera?

110
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
No?

111
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,296
Okay, we're just wasting
time that we don't have.

112
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,296
I need to speak to Saw
Gerrera. I keep telling them.

113
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,880
Before it's too late.

114
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Keep your heads down!

115
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,656
The Imperials will be
searching for him...

116
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,816
We're out here in
the middle of nowhere.

117
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,520
We need to get to Jedha City.

118
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,840
What part of "urgent message"
do you guys not understand?

119
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,280
We are all on the same side.

120
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,000
If you just see past
the uniform for a minute.

121
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,000
What now?

122
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,400
I don't know.
Must be another pickup.

123
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,000
I thought we had everybody.

124
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,320
All clear, sir.

125
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,360
Hallik! Liana Hallik!

126
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
Her.

127
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,400
You wanna get out of here?

128
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,480
Hey! What about me?

129
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,160
Give me the keys!
Give me the keys!

130
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,920
Congratulations.
You are being rescued.

131
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,560
Please do not resist.

132
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,720
LU-28,
report to maintenance level 4.

133
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,760
You're currently calling
yourself Liana Hallik.

134
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,920
Is that correct?

135
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,800
Possession of
unsanctioned weapons.

136
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,920
Forgery of Imperial documents.

137
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,640
Aggravated assault.
Escape from custody.

138
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,240
Resisting arrest.

139
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,440
Imagine if the Imperial
authorities had found out...

140
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,440
who you really were, Jyn Erso.

141
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,360
That is your given
name, is it not?

142
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,640
Jyn Erso, daughter
of Galen Erso?

143
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,880
A known Imperial collaborator
in weapons development.

144
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,120
What is this?

145
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,120
It's a chance
for you to make a fresh start.

146
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,080
We think you might
be able to help us.

147
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,400
This is Captain Cassian
Andor, Rebel Intelligence.

148
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,600
When was the last time you
were in contact with your father?

149
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,960
15 years ago.

150
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,080
Any idea where he's
been all that time?

151
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,440
I like to think he's dead.

152
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,960
Makes things easier.

153
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,280
Easier than what? That he's been
a tool of the Imperial war machine?

154
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,200
I've never had the luxury
of political opinions.

155
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Really?

156
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,680
When was your last contact
with Saw Gerrera?

157
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,640
It's been a long time.

158
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,600
But he'll remember you, though.

159
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,680
Wouldn't he?

160
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,000
He might agree to meet you,
if you came as a friend.

161
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,936
We're up against
the clock here, girl,

162
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,256
so if there's nothing
to talk about,

163
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,960
we'll just put you back
where we found you.

164
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,000
I was a child. Saw Gerrera
saved my life. He raised me.

165
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,296
But I have no idea where he is.

166
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,440
I haven't seen him in years.

167
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,880
We know how to find him.

168
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,200
That's not our problem.

169
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,520
What we need is someone

170
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,520
who gets us through the
door without being killed.

171
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,200
You're all rebels, aren't you?

172
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,240
Yes, but Saw Gerrera
is an extremist.

173
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,920
He's been fighting on his own
since he broke with the Rebellion.

174
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,680
His militancy has
caused the Alliance

175
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,840
a great many problems.

176
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,360
We have no choice now but to try

177
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,800
and mend that broken trust.

178
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,920
What does this
have to do with my father?

179
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,560
There's an Imperial defector
in Jedha. A pilot.

180
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,400
He's been held by Saw Gerrera.

181
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,480
He's claiming the Emperor
is creating a weapon

182
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,720
with the power to
destroy entire planets.

183
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,200
The pilot says he was
sent by your father.

184
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,400
We need to stop this weapon

185
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,600
before it is finished.

186
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,240
Captain Andor's mission

187
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,696
is to authenticate
the pilot's story.

188
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,280
And then, if possible,
find your father.

189
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,320
It appears he is critical
to the development

190
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,680
of this super weapon.

191
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Given the gravity
of the situation

192
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,720
and your history with Saw,

193
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,920
we're hoping that he will
help us locate your father

194
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,680
and return him to the Senate
for testimony.

195
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,080
And if I do it?

196
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,400
We'll make sure you go free.

197
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
Captain Andor.

198
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,040
I'm K-2SO.

199
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,960
I'm a reprogrammed
Imperial droid.

200
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,480
I remember you.

201
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,000
I see the Council is
sending you with us to Jedha.

202
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,840
Apparently so.

203
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,160
That is a bad idea. I think
so, and so does Cassian.

204
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
What do I know?

205
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,600
My specialty is just

206
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,480
strategic analysis.

207
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,160
Galen Erso is vital to
the Empire's weapons program.

208
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,560
Forget what you heard in there.

209
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,400
There will be no extraction.

210
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,720
You find him...

211
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,640
you kill him.

212
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,600
Then and there.

213
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
Shuttle number LMTR-20.

214
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,760
Prepare for takeoff while
we check your authorization.

215
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
You met K-2?

216
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,560
Charming.

217
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,840
He tends to say whatever
comes into his circuits.

218
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,160
It's a byproduct
of the reprogram.

219
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,840
Why does she get
a blaster and I don't?

220
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,880
What? I know how to use it.

221
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,720
That's what I'm
afraid of. Give it to me.

222
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,680
We're going to Jedha.

223
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,240
That's a war zone.

224
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,880
That's not the point.
Where'd you get it?

225
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
I found it.

226
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,560
I find that answer
vague and unconvincing.

227
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
Trust goes both ways.

228
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,280
You're letting her keep it?

229
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,960
Would you like to
know the probability

230
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,160
of her using it against you?

231
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,960
It's high.

232
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,560
Let's get going.

233
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,120
It's very high.

234
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Lies!

235
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,720
Deceptions!

236
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Let's see it.

237
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,240
"Bodhi Rook. Cargo pilot."

238
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,160
Local boy?

239
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,616
This was found in his boot
when he was captured.

240
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,560
Okay. I can hear you.

241
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,616
He didn't capture me. I
came here myself. I defected.

242
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
I defected.

243
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,040
Every day, more lies.

244
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,000
Lies? Would I risk
everything for a lie?

245
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,360
No, we don't have time for this.

246
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,920
I have to speak to Saw Gerrera
before it's too late.

247
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,600
Okay.

248
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,680
Sorry, you're...

249
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,040
That's for you.

250
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
And I gave it to them.

251
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,320
They did not find it!

252
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,760
I gave it to them.

253
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,440
Galen Erso.

254
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,840
He told me to find you.

255
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Bor Gullet.

256
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
Bor Gullet?

257
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,440
What? Wait!

258
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,600
Galen Erso sent me!

259
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,680
He told me to find you.

260
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,400
Most unfortunate about

261
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,800
the security breach on Jedha,
Director Krennic.

262
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,560
After so many setbacks
and delays, and now this.

263
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,280
We've heard word of rumors
circulating through the city.

264
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,120
Apparently, you've lost

265
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,440
a rather talkative cargo pilot.

266
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,440
If the Senate gets
wind of our project,

267
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,760
countless systems
will flock to the Rebellion.

268
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,400
When the battle station is
finished, Governor Tarkin...

269
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,800
the Senate will be
of little concern.

270
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,560
When has become now,
Director Krennic.

271
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,320
The Emperor will tolerate
no further delay.

272
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,400
You have made time
an ally of the Rebellion.

273
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,760
I suggest we solve both
problems simultaneously...

274
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,840
with an immediate
test of the weapon.

275
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,960
Failure will find
you explaining why

276
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,000
to a far less patient audience.

277
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,200
I will not fail.

278
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,680
What's the matter, Jyn?
You look frightened.

279
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,200
I'll always protect you.

280
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,000
Stardust.

281
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,680
Don't ever change.

282
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,760
Trust.

283
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
Galen.

284
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,040
- We're coming into orbit.
- You have controls.

285
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
That's Jedha.

286
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,400
Or what's left of it.

287
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,440
We find Saw,
we find your father.

288
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,280
What's with the Destroyer?

289
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,120
It's because of your
old friend, Saw Gerrera.

290
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,760
He's been attacking
the cargo shipments.

291
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,000
What are they bringing in?

292
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,520
It's what are they taking out.

293
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,560
Kyber crystal. All they can get.

294
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,536
We wondered why they
were stripping the temple.

295
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,600
Now we know.

296
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,200
It's the fuel for the weapon.

297
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,000
The weapon your
father's building.

298
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,240
Maybe we should leave
target practice behind.

299
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,160
Are you talking about me?

300
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,040
She's right.
We need to blend in.

301
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,400
Stay with the ship.

302
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,520
I can blend in.
I'm an Imperial droid.

303
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,800
The city is under
Imperial occupation.

304
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,560
Half the people here
wanna reprogram you.

305
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,320
The other half wanna
put a hole in your head.

306
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,840
I'm surprised you're so
concerned with my safety.

307
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
I'm not.

308
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,760
I'm just worried they
might miss you and hit me.

309
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,440
Doesn't sound so bad to me.

310
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,600
Bor Gullet can
feel your thoughts.

311
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,000
No lie is safe.

312
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,760
What have you really
brought me, cargo pilot?

313
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,040
Bor Gullet will know the truth.

314
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,280
The unfortunate side effect
is that one tends...

315
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,680
to lose one's mind.

316
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,360
No!

317
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,440
Hey.

318
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,400
You just watch yourself.

319
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
Wait. No, no.

320
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
Sorry, sir.

321
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,440
We don't want
any trouble. Sorry.

322
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,600
Come on. Come on.

323
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,680
Citizens of Jedha.

324
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,600
You must come forward
with information

325
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,840
of the location
of this missing cargo pilot.

326
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,840
A reward of 600 credits for the
information shall be awarded.

327
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I had a contact.

328
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
One of Saw's Rebels.

329
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,280
But he's just gone missing.

330
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,720
His sister will be
looking for him.

331
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,360
The temple's been destroyed,
but she'll be there waiting.

332
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,560
We'll give her your name

333
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,840
and hope that gets us
a meeting with Saw.

334
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,080
Hope?

335
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,960
Yeah. Rebellions
are built on hope.

336
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,880
Hands where I can see them.

337
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Get over there.

338
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,560
Show me some identification.
Check inside.

339
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,120
Is this all because
of your pilot?

340
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,600
May the Force
of others be with you.

341
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,000
Wait for me.

342
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,920
May the Force
of others be with you.

343
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,640
May the Force of
others be with you.

344
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,880
Would you trade that necklace
for a glimpse into your future?

345
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Yes.

346
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,160
I'm speaking to you.

347
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm Chirrut Imwe.

348
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,040
How did you know
I was wearing a necklace?

349
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,240
For that answer, you must pay.

350
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,400
What do you know
about kyber crystals?

351
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,080
My father, he...

352
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,160
He said they powered
the Jedi's lightsabers.

353
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,920
Jyn.

354
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,360
Come on. Let's go.

355
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,600
The strongest stars
have hearts of kyber.

356
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
Let's go.

357
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,600
We're not here to make friends.

358
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,680
Who are they?

359
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,520
The Guardians of the Whills.

360
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,240
Protectors of the Kyber Temple.

361
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,280
But there's nothing
left to protect.

362
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,960
So now they're just causing
trouble for everybody.

363
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,680
You seem awfully tense
all of a sudden.

364
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,720
We have to hurry.
This town is ready to blow.

365
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,720
Citizens of the Empire...

366
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,480
Imperial forces tirelessly fight

367
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,560
Saw Gerrera's reign of terror...

368
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,400
over the people of
this beloved city.

369
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,000
Truth and justice
are the tools of the Empire.

370
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,560
Tell me you have a backup plan.

371
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,240
Incoming!

372
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,800
Looks like we found
Saw's rebels.

373
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
Up there!

374
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Jyn, no!

375
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
Hit the terrorist.

376
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
Get out of there!

377
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,080
Kyber...

378
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,520
Come on!

379
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,520
This way!

380
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,280
Cassian!

381
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,840
Did you know that wasn't me?

382
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,280
Yeah. Of course.

383
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,360
I thought I told you
to stay on the ship.

384
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,360
You did. But I
thought it was boring,

385
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
and you were in trouble.

386
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,800
There were a lot
of explosions...

387
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,520
for two people
blending in. Freeze!

388
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
You're right.

389
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,240
I should just wait on the ship.

390
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,920
Halt. Stop right there.

391
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,200
Where are you taking
these prisoners?

392
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,440
These are prisoners.

393
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,920
Yes. Where are you taking them?

394
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,760
I am taking them to
imprison them in prison.

395
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,520
He's taking us to... Quiet!

396
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,640
And there's a fresh one
if you mouth off again.

397
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,136
We'll take them from
here. That's okay.

398
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,456
If you could just point me
in the right direction,

399
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,520
I can take them, I'm sure.

400
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,616
I've taken them this
far. Hey, wait a second.

401
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,720
Take them away. Wait.

402
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,240
You can't take them away.

403
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,800
You. Stay here.

404
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,320
We need to check
your diagnostics.

405
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Diagnostics?

406
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,800
I'm capable of running
my own diagnostics,

407
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
thank you very much.

408
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,640
Let them pass in peace.

409
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,160
Let them pass in peace.

410
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,800
The Force is with me.

411
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,360
And I am with the Force.

412
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,640
And I fear nothing.

413
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,400
For all is as
the Force wills it.

414
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,480
Hey, stop right there.

415
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,640
He's blind.

416
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,240
Is he deaf?

417
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,600
I said stop right there!

418
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,480
Is your foot all right?

419
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,520
You almost shot me.

420
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,360
You're welcome.

421
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,160
Clear of hostiles.

422
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,160
One hostile. He's with us.

423
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,320
They're all right.

424
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,560
Thanks.

425
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,520
Cassian, I'm sorry
about the slap.

426
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,560
Go back to the ship.
Wait for my call.

427
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
Is he a Jedi?

428
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,600
There are no Jedi here anymore.

429
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,240
Only dreamers like this fool.

430
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,240
The Force did protect me.

431
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
I protected you.

432
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
Can you get us to Saw Gerrera?

433
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,080
Can't you see? We are
no friends of the Empire.

434
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,976
Tell that to the one who killed our men.

435
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,520
Anyone who kills me
or my friends

436
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,440
will answer to Saw Gerrera.

437
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,640
And why is that?

438
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,240
Because I'm
the daughter of Galen Erso.

439
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,840
Take them!

440
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,120
Are you kidding me? I'm blind.

441
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,360
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

442
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,056
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

443
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,840
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

444
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
You pray?

445
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,880
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

446
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
Really?

447
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,920
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

448
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,160
He's praying for
the door to open.

449
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,280
It bothers him because
he knows it's possible.

450
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,640
Baze Malbus was once the most
devoted Guardian of us all.

451
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,560
I'm beginning to think the Force
and I have different priorities.

452
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,160
Relax, Captain.

453
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,920
We've been in worse cages
than this one.

454
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,880
This is the first for me.

455
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,920
There is more than one
sort of prison, Captain.

456
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,400
I sense that you carry
yours wherever you go.

457
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,320
Jyn.

458
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,440
Is it really you?

459
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,480
I can't believe it!

460
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,360
Must be quite a surprise.

461
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,600
Are we not still friends?

462
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,440
The last time I saw you,

463
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,776
you gave me a knife
and loaded blaster...

464
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,400
and told me to wait
in a bunker till daylight.

465
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,360
I knew you were safe.

466
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,360
You left me behind.

467
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,840
You were already the
best soldier in my cadre.

468
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,880
I was 16! I was protecting you!

469
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
You dumped me!

470
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,240
You were the daughter of
an Imperial science officer.

471
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,480
People were starting
to figure that out.

472
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,440
People who wanted to
use you as a hostage.

473
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,520
Not a day goes by...

474
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,280
that I don't think of you.

475
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,120
But today...

476
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,680
of all days...

477
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,040
It's a trap.

478
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,560
Isn't it?

479
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
What?

480
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,560
The pilot.

481
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,000
The message.

482
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,200
All of it.

483
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,880
Did they send you?

484
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,880
Did you come here...

485
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,400
to kill me?

486
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,880
There's not much of me left.

487
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,360
The Alliance wants my father.

488
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,400
They think he sent you
a message about a weapon.

489
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,360
I guess they think
by sending me,

490
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,200
you might actually
help them out.

491
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,040
So what is it
that you want, Jyn?

492
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,280
They wanted an
introduction, they've got it.

493
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,680
I'm out now.

494
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,680
Rest of you
can do what you want.

495
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,440
You care not about the cause?

496
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,280
The cause?

497
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,040
Seriously?

498
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,520
The Alliance...

499
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,200
the rebels, whatever it is

500
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,680
you're calling yourself
these days...

501
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,920
all it's ever
brought me is pain.

502
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,800
You can stand to
see the Imperial flag

503
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,840
reign across the galaxy?

504
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,800
It's not a problem
if you don't look up.

505
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,080
I have something to show you.

506
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,400
Come.

507
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,560
The Emperor is
awaiting my report.

508
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,400
One would hope that
he and Lord Vader

509
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,000
might've been here
for such an occasion.

510
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,376
And I thought it
prudent to save you

511
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,680
from any potential
embarrassment.

512
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,960
Your concern's hardly warranted.

513
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,400
If saying it would
only make it so.

514
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,440
All Imperial forces
have been evacuated...

515
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,640
and I stand ready
to destroy the entire moon.

516
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,960
That won't be necessary.

517
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,120
We need a statement,
not a manifesto.

518
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,880
The Holy City will
be enough for today.

519
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,120
Target Jedha City.

520
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,240
Prepare single reactor ignition.

521
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,480
Sir, we're in position... Fire!

522
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,160
Commence primary ignition.

523
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,280
Who's the one in the next cell?

524
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,080
What?

525
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,160
Where?

526
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,800
An Imperial pilot.

527
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,000
Pilot? I'm gonna kill him!

528
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,256
No, no. No, wait! Come here!

529
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,840
No!

530
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,720
Back off! Back off!

531
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,000
Okay, okay.

532
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,200
Are you the pilot?

533
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,120
Hey. Hey. Are you the
pilot? The shuttle pilot?

534
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,520
Pilot?

535
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,200
What's wrong with him?

536
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,360
Galen Erso.

537
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,600
You know that name?

538
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,040
I brought the message.
I'm the pilot.

539
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,000
I'm the pilot.

540
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,400
I'm the pilot.

541
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,240
Okay. Good.

542
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,800
Now where is Galen Erso?

543
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,280
Stand by.

544
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,720
This is the message I was sent.

545
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,160
Saw, if you are watching this...

546
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,400
then perhaps there's a chance
to save the Alliance.

547
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,760
Perhaps there's a chance
to explain myself...

548
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,920
and, though I don't dare
hope for too much...

549
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,640
a chance for Jyn,
if she's alive...

550
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,760
if you can possibly find her...

551
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,680
to let her know that my love
for her has never faded...

552
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,240
and how desperately
I've missed her.

553
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,240
Jyn, my Stardust...

554
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,240
I can't imagine
what you think of me.

555
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,160
When I was taken,
I faced some bitter truths.

556
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,120
I was told that soon enough

557
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,920
Krennic would have you as well.

558
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,200
As time went by...

559
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,280
I knew that you
were either dead...

560
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,760
or so well hidden that
he would never find you.

561
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,320
I knew if I had refused to
work, if I took my own life...

562
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,776
it would only be a matter of
time before Krennic realized...

563
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,160
he no longer needed me
to complete the project.

564
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,800
So I did the one thing
nobody expected.

565
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,920
I lied.

566
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,480
I learned to lie.

567
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,800
I played the part
of a beaten man

568
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,720
resigned to the sanctuary
of his work.

569
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,640
I made myself indispensable...

570
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,920
and all the while, I laid
the groundwork of my revenge.

571
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
We call it the Death Star.

572
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,040
There is no better name...

573
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,640
and the day is coming soon
when it will be unleashed.

574
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,560
I've placed a weakness
deep within the system...

575
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,320
a flaw so small and powerful,
they will never find it.

576
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,520
But, Jyn...

577
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,400
Jyn, if you're listening,
my beloved...

578
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,280
so much of my life
has been wasted.

579
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,320
I try to think of you only in
the moments when I'm strong...

580
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,160
because the pain of
not having you with me...

581
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,280
your mother, our family.

582
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,520
The pain of that loss
is so overwhelming...

583
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,680
I risk failing even now.

584
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,280
It's just so hard
not to think of you.

585
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,040
Think of where you are...

586
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,000
my Stardust.

587
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,400
Saw...

588
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,720
the reactor module,
that's the key.

589
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,720
That's the place
I've laid my trap.

590
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,160
It's well hidden and unstable.

591
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,360
One blast to any part of it
will destroy the entire station.

592
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,400
You'll need the plans...

593
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,280
the structural plans for the
Death Star, to find the reactor.

594
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,960
I know there's a complete
engineering archive...

595
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,200
in the data vault at the
Citadel Tower on Scarif.

596
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,720
Any pressurized explosion
to the reactor module...

597
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,520
will set off a chain reaction
that will destroy the entire station.

598
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,720
Go, go!

599
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,040
K-2, K-2! Where are you?

600
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,600
There you are.

601
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,720
I'm standing by
as you requested...

602
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,040
although there's a problem
on the horizon.

603
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,200
There's no horizon.

604
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,040
Locate our position.
Bring that ship in here, now!

605
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,480
Where are you going?

606
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,080
I gotta find Jyn.

607
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,840
Get the pilot, we need him!

608
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,320
All right.

609
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,960
I'll get the pilot.

610
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,640
Pilot.

611
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,320
No, no, no!

612
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,280
Let's go.

613
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,440
Jyn!

614
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,280
Jyn!

615
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,720
Hey.

616
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
We gotta go.

617
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,080
I know where your father is.

618
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,200
Go with him, Jyn.

619
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,400
You must go!

620
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,520
Come with us.

621
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,320
I will run no longer.

622
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,640
Come on.
But you must save yourself.

623
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,360
Come on. Go!

624
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,480
There's no time!

625
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,920
Save the Rebellion!

626
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,480
Save the dream.

627
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,680
It's beautiful.

628
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,440
Chirrut, let's go!

629
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,520
Come on!

630
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,480
Let's get out of here!

631
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,160
Get us out of here!

632
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,360
Punch it!

633
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,336
I'm not very optimistic
about our odds.

634
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,360
Not now, K.

635
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,560
Come on!

636
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,320
Punch it.

637
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,616
I haven't completed
my calculations.

638
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,720
I'll make them for you.

639
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,920
I believe I owe you an
apology, Director Krennic.

640
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,080
Your work exceeds
all expectations.

641
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,040
And you'll tell
the Emperor as much?

642
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,536
I will tell him that his patience
with your misadventures...

643
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,880
has been rewarded with a weapon

644
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,400
that will bring a swift
end to the Rebellion.

645
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,600
And that that was
only an inkling

646
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,400
of its destructive potential.

647
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,080
I will tell him that I will be
taking control over the weapon...

648
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,720
I first spoke of years ago
effective immediately.

649
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,920
We stand here
amidst my achievement.

650
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,640
Not yours!

651
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,480
I'm afraid the recent
security breaches...

652
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,240
have laid bare your inadequacies

653
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,080
as a military director.

654
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,400
The breaches have been filled.

655
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,160
Jedha has been silenced.

656
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,040
You think this pilot
acted alone?

657
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,680
He was dispatched from
the installation on Eadu...

658
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,960
Galen Erso's facility.

659
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,160
We'll see about this.

660
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,440
A coded message
from Captain Andor, sir.

661
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,680
"Weapon confirmed."

662
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,680
"Jedha destroyed."

663
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,520
"Mission target located
on Eadu, please advise."

664
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,680
Destroyed?

665
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,720
Proceed.

666
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,200
Tell him my orders still stand.

667
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,360
Tell him to proceed
with haste...

668
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,000
and keep to the plan.

669
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,640
We have no idea what
he's building for the Empire.

670
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,200
We have to kill Galen Erso
while we have the chance.

671
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,560
Baze, tell me.

672
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,720
All of it?

673
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,200
The whole city?

674
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,000
Tell me.

675
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,240
All of it.

676
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,080
Understood.

677
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,960
Set course for Eadu.

678
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,480
Setting course for Eadu.

679
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,520
Is that where my father is?

680
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,680
I think so.

681
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,840
So you're Galen's daughter?

682
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,440
You know him?

683
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,120
I am Bodhi, the pilot.

684
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,480
You brought the message.

685
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,600
Yes.

686
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,000
Your father...

687
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,840
he said I could
get right by myself.

688
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,000
He said I could make it right...

689
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,040
if I was brave enough...

690
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,680
to listen to what
was in my heart.

691
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,440
Do something about it.

692
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,600
Guess it was too late.

693
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,520
It wasn't too late.

694
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,960
Seems pretty late to me.

695
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,560
No.

696
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,480
We can beat the people
who did this.

697
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,480
My father's message,
I've seen it.

698
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,720
They call it the Death Star.

699
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,360
But they have no idea...

700
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,200
there's a way to defeat it.

701
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,600
You're wrong about my father.

702
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:33,800
He did build it.

703
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,840
Because he knew
they'd do it without him.

704
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,960
My father made a choice.

705
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,480
He sacrificed himself
for the Rebellion.

706
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,040
He's rigged a trap inside it.

707
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,520
That's why he sent you,
to bring that message.

708
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,760
Where is it?

709
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,760
Where's the message?

710
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,200
It was a hologram.

711
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,720
You have that message, right?

712
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,000
Everything happened so fast.

713
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,880
Did you see it?

714
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,080
You don't believe me?

715
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,360
I'm not the one
you've got to convince.

716
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,720
I believe her.

717
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,800
That's good to know.

718
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,120
What kind of trap?

719
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,880
You said your father
made a trap.

720
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,200
The reactor. He's
placed a weakness there.

721
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,496
He's been hiding it for years.

722
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,440
He said if you can
blow the reactor,

723
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,360
the module, the whole
system goes down.

724
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,040
You need to send word
to the Alliance.

725
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,000
I've done that.

726
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,240
They have to know there's
a way to destroy this thing.

727
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,080
They have to go to Scarif
to get the plans.

728
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,840
I can't risk sending that.

729
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,840
We're in the heart
of Imperial territory.

730
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,800
Then we'll find him
and bring him back.

731
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,200
And he can tell them himself.

732
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,240
Course set for Eadu, sir.

733
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,096
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

734
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,376
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

735
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,400
20 degrees to the right.

736
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,600
10 degrees up.

737
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,000
Lower, lower, lower. Lower!

738
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,840
Are you sure this is the way?

739
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,360
They have landing trackers here.

740
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,480
They have patrol squadrons.

741
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,320
You've got to stay in
the canyon. Keep it low.

742
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,960
Watch your right!

743
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,080
There's a 26% chance of failure.

744
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,240
How much farther?

745
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,336
I don't know, I'm not sure.
I never really come this way.

746
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,560
But we're close, we're
close. I know that.

747
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,016
Now, there's a 35%
chance of failure.

748
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,336
- I don't wanna know.
- Thank you!

749
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,360
I understand.

750
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,000
Now! Put it down, now!

751
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,320
The wind.

752
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,761
If you keep going, you'll be
right over the shuttle depot.

753
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
- Watch out!
- K!

754
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,440
Hold on tight!

755
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,000
We're coming down hard!

756
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,360
Try them again.

757
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,320
I am, sir. We...

758
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,120
The signal's gone dead.

759
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,960
Squadron up.

760
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,960
Target Eadu.

761
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,240
How about now?
Check stabilizers.

762
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,160
Bodhi, where's the lab?

763
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,280
The research facility?

764
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,400
Yeah. Where is it?

765
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,160
It's just over that ridge.

766
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,560
That's a shuttle depot
straight ahead of us.

767
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,360
You are sure of that? Yes.

768
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,880
We'll have to hope

769
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,680
there's still an Imperial
ship left to steal.

770
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,520
Here's what we're doing.

771
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,640
Hopefully the storm keeps up
and keeps us hidden down here.

772
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,680
Bodhi, you're coming with me.

773
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,360
We'll go up the ridge
and check it out.

774
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,680
I'm coming with you.

775
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,480
No, your father's message.

776
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,720
We can't risk it.
You're the messenger.

777
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,496
That's ridiculous,
we all got the message.

778
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,640
Everyone here knows it.

779
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,296
"One blast to the reactor module

780
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,040
"and the whole
system goes down."

781
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,840
That's how you said it,
"The whole system goes down."

782
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,040
Get to work fixing our comms.

783
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,960
All I want to do right now is get a
handle on what we're up against.

784
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,000
So we're gonna go very small
and very careful up the rise...

785
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,160
and see what's what.

786
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,120
Let's get outta here.

787
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,920
Does he look like a killer?

788
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,040
No. He has the face of a friend.

789
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,920
Who are you talking about?

790
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,560
Captain Andor.

791
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,760
Why'd you ask that?

792
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,760
What do you mean,
"Does he look like a killer?"

793
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,320
The Force moves darkly

794
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,320
near a creature
that's about to kill.

795
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,480
His weapon was in
the sniper configuration.

796
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,120
No, no, no. We've got to go up.

797
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,800
You can't see much
from down there.

798
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,760
This way.

799
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,560
I'll be right behind you.

800
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,560
Come on.

801
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,960
Where are you going?

802
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,040
I'm gonna follow Jyn.

803
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,120
Her path is clear.

804
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,880
Alone?

805
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,400
Good luck!

806
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,560
I don't need luck. I have you!

807
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,160
What are they doing?

808
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,240
If Cassian comes back,
we're leaving without them.

809
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,720
You see Erso out there?

810
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,680
We've come too far.

811
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,680
Patience, my friend.

812
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,040
That's him.

813
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,880
That's him.
Galen, in the dark suit.

814
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,400
Get back down there and
find us a ride outta here.

815
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,600
Well, what are you doing?

816
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,640
You heard me.

817
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,496
You said we came up here
just to have a look.

818
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,680
I'm here, I'm looking. Go.

819
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,080
Hurry!

820
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,280
Excellent news, Galen.

821
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,040
The battle station is complete.

822
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,000
You must be very proud.

823
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,560
Proud as I can be, Krennic.

824
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,760
Gather your engineers.
I have an announcement.

825
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,200
Is that all of them?

826
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,640
Yes.

827
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,240
Gentlemen, one of you...

828
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,600
betrayed the Empire.

829
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,320
One of you has
conspired with a pilot...

830
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,440
to send messages
to the Rebellion.

831
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,560
And I urge that traitor...

832
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,000
step forward.

833
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:24,880
Very well...

834
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I'll consider it
a group effort then.

835
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,360
Ready!

836
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,040
No! No! Aim!

837
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,000
And fire!

838
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,600
Stop! Stop! Stop!

839
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,760
Krennic, stop!

840
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,080
It was me!

841
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,120
It was me!

842
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,920
They have nothing to do with it.

843
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,480
Spare them.

844
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,680
Fire!

845
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,240
How do I know
the weapon is complete?

846
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,920
Let me share with
you some details.

847
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,360
Cassian.

848
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,360
Cassian, can you hear me?

849
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,880
I'm here. You've got it working?

850
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,840
Affirmative, yes.
Although we have a problem.

851
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,480
There's an Alliance squadron
approaching. Clear the area.

852
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,880
No, no, no, no!
Tell them to hold off!

853
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,440
Jyn's on that platform.

854
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,440
Jedha...

855
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,720
Saw Gerrera.
His band of fanatics...

856
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,440
their Holy City...

857
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,960
the last reminder of the Jedi,

858
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,240
gone.

859
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,920
You'll never win.

860
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,320
Now where have I
heard that before?

861
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,200
Relay from Captain Andor.

862
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,560
General.

863
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,280
Captain Andor requesting
a delay on squadron support.

864
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,960
Alliance forces on site.
Please confirm.

865
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,840
Get the squadron leader on.
Get him on now!

866
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,280
They're already engaged, sir.

867
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,680
Jyn. No.

868
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,960
Return fire! To your stations!

869
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,240
Get our fighters in the air now!

870
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,480
Father!

871
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,680
Roger that. 3 through 7.

872
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,880
Fall back! Fall back!

873
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:59,080
Director, we need to evacuate.

874
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,600
Papa. Papa, it's me.

875
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,400
It's Jyn.

876
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,240
Jyn?

877
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,640
Stardust.

878
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,720
Papa.

879
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,640
I've seen your message.

880
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,840
The hologram, I've seen it.

881
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,920
It must be destroyed.

882
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,080
I know. I know.

883
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:35,920
We will.

884
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,320
Jyn.

885
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,080
Look at you.

886
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,800
I have so much to tell you.

887
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:59,520
Papa.

888
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,560
No.

889
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,720
No! Papa.

890
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,360
Papa, come on!

891
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,160
Over there! Take 'em down.

892
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,520
Come on. Papa. Come on.

893
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,920
Jyn, we gotta go. Come on.

894
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,360
I can't leave him.

895
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,760
Listen to me, he's gone.

896
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,680
Nothing you can do. Come on.

897
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,160
I can't leave him. Come on!

898
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,480
I can't.

899
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,720
Move!

900
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,920
- This way, this way!
- Down!

901
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,320
Come on! Come on!

902
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:56,760
Well done.

903
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,120
You're a rebel now.

904
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,080
Let's go! Let's go!

905
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,600
Come on, let's move!

906
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,600
Come on, let's get out of here!

907
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,200
Move, move, move!

908
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,240
Okay, K-2. Let's go!

909
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:16,600
Copy that.

910
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,680
Ion thrusters low until
we've cleared the storm.

911
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,040
Understood.

912
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,640
You lied to me.

913
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,040
You're in shock.

914
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,840
You went up there
to kill my father.

915
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,480
You don't know
what you're talking about.

916
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,080
Deny it.

917
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:12,040
You're in shock and looking
for some place to put it.

918
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,360
I've seen it before.

919
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,680
I bet you have.

920
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:15,840
They know.

921
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,600
You lied about why we came here

922
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,320
and you lied about
why you went up alone.

923
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,080
I had every chance
to pull the trigger...

924
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,840
but did I?

925
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:28,920
Did I?

926
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,560
You might as well have.

927
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,880
My father was living proof...

928
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,360
and you put him at risk.

929
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,840
Those were Alliance bombs
that killed him.

930
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,520
I had orders...

931
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,840
orders that I disobeyed.

932
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,520
But you wouldn't
understand that.

933
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,760
Orders?

934
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,880
When you know they're wrong?

935
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,880
You might as well
be a Stormtrooper.

936
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,360
What do you know?

937
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,760
We don't all have
the luxury of deciding...

938
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,240
when and where we want to
care about something.

939
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,000
Suddenly the Rebellion
is real for you.

940
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,320
Some of us live it.

941
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:05,320
I've been in this fight
since I was 6 years old.

942
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,880
You're not the only one
who lost everything.

943
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,800
Some of us just decided
to do something about it.

944
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,760
You can't talk
your way around this.

945
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,000
I don't have to.

946
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,360
Yavin 4.

947
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,240
Make sure they know we're
coming in with a stolen ship.

948
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,200
Anybody else?

949
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,640
My lord, Director Krennic...

950
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,800
has arrived.

951
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,480
Director Krennic.

952
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,720
Lord Vader.

953
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,960
You seem unsettled.

954
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,320
No...

955
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,640
just pressed for time.

956
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,080
There's a great many
things to attend to.

957
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,680
My apologies.

958
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,120
You do have a great
many things to explain.

959
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,680
I delivered the weapon
the Emperor requested.

960
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,640
I deserve an audience...

961
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,720
to make certain that he
understands its remarkable...

962
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,240
potential.

963
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,560
Its power to create problems
has certainly been confirmed.

964
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,640
A city destroyed...

965
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,720
an Imperial facility
openly attacked.

966
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,200
It was Governor Tarkin
that suggested the test.

967
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:30,040
You were not summoned here
to grovel, Director Krennic.

968
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,160
No...

969
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,240
There is no Death Star.

970
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,640
The Senate has been informed...

971
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:38,080
that Jedha was destroyed
in a mining disaster.

972
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,320
Yes, my lord.

973
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,920
I expect you not to rest until
you can assure the Emperor...

974
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,560
that Galen Erso
has not compromised

975
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,920
this weapon in any way.

976
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,280
So I'm still in command?

977
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,360
You'll speak to
the Emperor about...

978
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:17,800
Be careful not to choke
on your aspirations, Director.

979
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,120
We must scatter the fleet.

980
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,600
We have no recourse
but to surrender.

981
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,360
Are we really talking
about disbanding something...

982
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,520
that we've worked
so hard to create?

983
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,280
We can't just give in!

984
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,320
We joined an alliance,
not a suicide pact.

985
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,200
We've only now managed
to gather our forces.

986
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,000
Gather our forces?

987
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,360
General Draven's already
blown up an Imperial base.

988
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,880
A decision needed to be made!

989
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,560
If it's war you want...

990
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,120
you'll fight alone.

991
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,256
If that's how it's going,
why have an alliance at all?

992
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,320
If she's telling the truth,
we need to act now!

993
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:00,840
Councilors, please.

994
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
It is simple.

995
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,640
The Empire has the means
of mass destruction...

996
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:05,880
the Rebellion does not.

997
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,840
A Death Star. This is nonsense.

998
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,560
What reason would
my father have to lie?

999
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,440
What benefit would it bring him?

1000
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,440
To lure our forces
into a final battle

1001
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,840
to destroy us once and for all.

1002
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,840
- Risk everything?
- Based on what?

1003
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,240
The testimony of a criminal?

1004
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,520
The dying words of her
father, an Imperial scientist?

1005
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,480
But don't forget
the Imperial pilot.

1006
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,176
My father gave his life so that

1007
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,600
we may have a chance
to defeat this.

1008
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,800
So you've told us.

1009
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,200
If the Empire has
this kind of power,

1010
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,520
what chance do we have?

1011
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,080
What chance do we have?

1012
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,720
The question is "what choice."

1013
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:39,560
Run, hide...

1014
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,120
plead for mercy,
scatter your forces.

1015
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,080
You give way to an enemy
this evil with this much power...

1016
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:48,160
and you condemn the galaxy
to an eternity of submission.

1017
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,120
- The time to fight is now!
- Yes.

1018
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,440
Every moment you waste

1019
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,560
is another step closer
to the ashes of Jedha.

1020
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,680
What is she proposing?

1021
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:57,840
Just let the girl speak.

1022
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,760
Send your best troops to Scarif.

1023
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,760
Send the rebel fleet
if you have to.

1024
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,200
You need to capture
the Death Star plans

1025
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,800
if there's any hope
of destroying it.

1026
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,960
You're asking us to invade
an Imperial installation...

1027
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:18,000
based on nothing but hope.

1028
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,520
Rebellions are built on hope.

1029
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,080
There is no hope.

1030
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,920
I say we fight.

1031
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,720
I say the Rebellion is finished!

1032
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,680
I'm sorry, Jyn.

1033
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,840
Without the full support
of the Council...

1034
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,720
the odds are too great.

1035
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,000
General Syndulla,

1036
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,000
please report to
the briefing room.

1037
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,720
You don't look happy.

1038
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,600
They prefer to surrender.

1039
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:13,760
And you?

1040
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,080
She wants to fight.

1041
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,320
So do I. We all do.

1042
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,560
The Force is strong.

1043
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,320
I'm not sure four of us
is quite enough.

1044
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,800
How many do we need?

1045
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,320
What are you talking about?

1046
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,480
They were never
gonna believe you.

1047
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,240
I appreciate the support.

1048
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,040
But I do.

1049
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,040
I believe you.

1050
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,320
We'd like to volunteer.

1051
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,840
Some of us...

1052
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,800
Well, most of us...

1053
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,640
we've all done terrible things
on behalf of the Rebellion.

1054
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,840
Spies...

1055
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,440
saboteurs, assassins.

1056
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,080
Everything I did,
I did for the Rebellion.

1057
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,840
And every time I walked away...

1058
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,440
from something
I wanted to forget...

1059
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,200
I told myself it was for a
cause that I believed in.

1060
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,880
A cause that was worth it.

1061
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,600
Without that, we're lost.

1062
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,440
Everything we've done
would have been for nothing.

1063
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,280
I couldn't face myself
if I gave up now.

1064
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,400
None of us could.

1065
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,840
It won't be comfortable.

1066
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,880
It'd be a bit cramped,
but we'd all fit.

1067
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,640
We could go.

1068
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,440
Okay. Gear up.

1069
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,920
Grab anything
that's not nailed down.

1070
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:03,920
Go, go, go!

1071
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,040
Jyn.

1072
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,040
I'll be there for you.

1073
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,920
Cassian said I had to.

1074
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,160
I'm not used to people sticking
around when things go bad.

1075
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,360
Welcome home.

1076
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,280
May the Force be with us.

1077
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,200
Cargo shuttle, read back please.

1078
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,440
What's going on out there?

1079
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,520
That ship's off-limits.

1080
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,480
No one's supposed to be on
board until further instructions.

1081
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,000
Yes, yes, we are.

1082
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,320
Affirmative.

1083
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,880
That's an impounded
Imperial ship.

1084
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,280
What's your call sign, pilot?

1085
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,520
We have to go.

1086
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,080
It's...

1087
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,320
Say something.

1088
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:19,840
Come on.

1089
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:21,520
Rogue.

1090
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,240
Rogue One.

1091
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,680
Rogue One?

1092
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:27,960
There is no Rogue One!

1093
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,680
Well, there is now.

1094
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,480
Rogue One, pulling away.

1095
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,160
Pulling away.

1096
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:52,560
Despite what the others say,
war is inevitable.

1097
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:53,720
Yes, I agree.

1098
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,080
I must return to Alderaan
to inform my people

1099
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,080
that there will be no peace.

1100
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,920
We will need every advantage.

1101
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,360
Your friend...

1102
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,880
the Jedi.

1103
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,560
He served me well
during the Clone Wars...

1104
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,160
and has lived in hiding
since the Emperor's purge.

1105
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,760
Yes, I will send for him.

1106
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,160
You will need someone
you can trust.

1107
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,120
I would trust her with my life.

1108
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:21,920
Captain Antilles. Senator.

1109
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,080
I have a mission for you, sir.

1110
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:36,680
Okay. We're coming in.

1111
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,880
There's a planet-wide
defensive shield...

1112
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,400
with a single main entry gate.

1113
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,200
This shuttle
should be equipped with

1114
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,440
an access code that
allows us through.

1115
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,760
Assuming the Empire hasn't
logged it as overdue.

1116
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,320
And if they have?

1117
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,800
Then they shut the gate.

1118
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,240
And we're all annihilated

1119
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,600
in the cold,
dark vacuum of space.

1120
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,920
Not me.

1121
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,880
I can survive in space.

1122
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,640
Okay.

1123
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:14,960
Here goes.

1124
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:23,000
Cargo shuttle SW-0608
requesting a landing pad.

1125
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:28,080
Cargo shuttle SW-0608,

1126
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,040
you're not listed on
the arrival schedule.

1127
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,240
Acknowledged, Gate Control.

1128
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:35,120
We were rerouted
from Eadu flight station.

1129
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,600
Transmitting clearance code now.

1130
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,080
Transmitting.

1131
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,320
Cargo shuttle, SW-0608...

1132
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,800
you are cleared for entry. Yes!

1133
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:59,400
Impressive.

1134
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,360
I'll tell the others.

1135
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,200
Okay.

1136
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:16,000
Tractor
beam test in bays 2 through 8.

1137
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:19,320
Tractor beam test
in bays 2 through 8.

1138
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:30,840
SW-0608,
cleared for Landing Pad 9.

1139
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,840
Acknowledge, please.

1140
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,680
SW-0608 proceeding
to LP 9 as instructed.

1141
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,920
Main building
down there, what is it?

1142
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,600
That's the Citadel Tower.

1143
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:43,520
They keep all the Imperial
structural archives up there.

1144
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,960
If the plans are anywhere,
they'll be there.

1145
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,880
And the dish
at the top, what's it for?

1146
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,280
I guess it takes a lot of signal
to send those data files out.

1147
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:56,880
Landing track, engaged.

1148
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:58,880
Landing track locked.

1149
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:11,800
We're landing.

1150
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,520
We're coming in.

1151
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,440
Saw Gerrera used to say...

1152
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:27,240
one fighter with a sharp stick and
nothing left to lose can take the day.

1153
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,080
They've no idea we're coming.

1154
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,000
They've no reason to expect us.

1155
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,200
If we can make it to the ground,

1156
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,880
we'll take the next chance.

1157
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:43,760
And the next.
On and on until we win...

1158
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,080
or the chances are spent.

1159
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,080
The Death Star plans
are down there.

1160
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,440
Cassian, K-2, and I
will find them.

1161
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,760
We'll find a way to find them.

1162
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:03,600
Melshi...

1163
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,400
Pao...

1164
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,600
Baze, Chirrut...

1165
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,280
you'll take the main squad.

1166
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,080
Move east and get
wide of the ship.

1167
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:12,440
Find a position between
here and the tower.

1168
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,640
Once you get to the best spot...

1169
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,480
light the place up.

1170
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,920
Make 10 men feel like 100.

1171
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,160
And get those troopers
away from us.

1172
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,240
What should I do?

1173
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,760
Keep the engine running.

1174
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,600
You're our only way outta here.

1175
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:03,840
Cargo shuttle SW-0608...

1176
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,320
be prepared to receive
inspection team.

1177
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,600
Ready?

1178
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:22,880
Hello.

1179
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:23,920
Hey.

1180
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,320
You're probably
looking for a manifest?

1181
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,480
That would be helpful.

1182
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,680
It's just down here.

1183
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,160
Director Krennic,

1184
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,120
we are entering
the Scarif shield gate.

1185
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,960
General Ramda has been
informed of your arrival.

1186
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,480
Good luck...

1187
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,280
little sister.

1188
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,840
Go! Go now! You're clear!

1189
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:23,240
All right, let's go!
Come on. Move, move, move.

1190
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,400
925-H to transport control.

1191
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,080
925-H to transport control.

1192
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,880
I've got a bad feeling about...

1193
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,080
K! Quiet!

1194
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:56,280
What?

1195
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,080
We need a map.

1196
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:36,760
Well, I'm sure there's
one just lying about.

1197
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,440
You know what you have to do.

1198
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,840
One per pad.

1199
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,880
Pick your spot.
We wanna draw them out.

1200
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:15,640
I'll call the timing. Go!

1201
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,480
Hey, did you hear the rumors?

1202
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,360
Yeah, the T-15s
have been marked obsolete.

1203
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,280
Boy, it's about time for that.

1204
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:25,200
Hey!

1205
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,480
What the...

1206
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:55,720
Director, what
brings you to Scarif?

1207
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:57,200
Galen Erso.

1208
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,920
I want every dispatch,

1209
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,520
every transmission
he has ever sent...

1210
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:03,040
called up for inspection.

1211
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,120
All of them?

1212
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,160
Yes, all of them.

1213
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:09,560
Get started.

1214
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:42,720
K.

1215
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,040
Our optimal route
to the data vault

1216
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,560
places only 89
Stormtroopers in our path.

1217
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:49,960
We will make it no
more than 33% of the way

1218
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,200
before we are killed.

1219
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:58,880
Melshi, talk to me.

1220
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,120
Ready. Ready. Standing by.

1221
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:07,320
Light it up.

1222
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:16,480
Come on.

1223
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:32,360
Are we blind?

1224
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,040
Deploy the garrison!

1225
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:35,320
Move!

1226
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:54,920
Troopers!

1227
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:57,600
Troopers! Troopers on the left.

1228
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,200
Get in! Get in!

1229
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:25,480
Sir, it's Scarif base.

1230
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,040
They're reporting
a Rebel incursion.

1231
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:28,720
I want to speak
with Director Krennic.

1232
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:31,040
He's there, sir. On Scarif.

1233
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,720
The original plans for this
station are kept there, are they not?

1234
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:35,880
They are.

1235
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,480
Prepare for the jump
to hyperspace

1236
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,520
and inform Lord Vader.

1237
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,120
Can we help you?

1238
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:50,400
That won't be necessary.

1239
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,480
Senator!

1240
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,520
Senator!

1241
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:11,840
Stop right there, Private.

1242
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,360
Let him speak.

1243
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,480
Intercepted Imperial
transmission, ma'am.

1244
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,280
Rebels on Scarif.

1245
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,720
I need to speak
with Admiral Raddus.

1246
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,760
He's returned to his ship.

1247
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:24,600
He's going to fight.

1248
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:36,840
No!

1249
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:44,000
Attention, all flight personnel,

1250
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,840
please report to
your commanders immediately.

1251
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:48,600
All flight personnel,

1252
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,440
please report to
your commanders immediately.

1253
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,400
We have been
redirected to Scarif.

1254
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,760
Pilots, you'll be briefed

1255
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,760
by your squadron leaders
en route.

1256
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,360
May the Force be with you.

1257
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:03,640
Scarif? They're going to Scarif?

1258
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,360
Why does nobody
ever tell me anything, R2?

1259
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:11,320
Move, move, move!

1260
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:17,640
Forward! Forward!

1261
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:20,000
Keep drawing them out!

1262
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:27,400
Pad 12, report to ground.

1263
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:28,896
Coming in on our flank.
We need numbers.

1264
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,280
Pad 14,
what's going on down there?

1265
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:33,120
Status please. All pads
report in immediately.

1266
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,600
No. We have rebels everywhere!

1267
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:35,720
We're taking fire!

1268
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:38,080
Pad 12,
Pad 14 request assistance.

1269
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,440
This is Pad 2. Pad 2.

1270
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,520
I spot 40 rebels
heading west on Pad 2.

1271
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:45,056
Get on there. Tell him you're
pinned down by rebels on Pad 5.

1272
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:47,800
This is Pad 5!
We're being overrun! Help us!

1273
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:50,080
Pad 12, Pad 10,
Pad 8, please confirm.

1274
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,480
Confirm and report.

1275
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,640
Get reinforcements down
to Pad 5 immediately!

1276
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,600
This is not working, K!

1277
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:01,720
Right hand.

1278
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:24,160
Baze!

1279
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:26,720
Baze! What?

1280
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,320
Run!

1281
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,400
Karabast! AT-AT!

1282
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:38,880
Move!

1283
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,440
This is Admiral Raddus
of the Rebel Alliance.

1284
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,560
All squadron leaders, report in.

1285
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:04,120
Admiral, this is
Blue Leader standing by.

1286
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,680
This is Gold Leader standing by.

1287
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:09,120
This is Red Leader standing by.

1288
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,480
Sir, those are rebel ships.

1289
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:13,640
Get Admiral Gorin, immediately!

1290
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,480
Director, the rebel fleet,

1291
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,160
it's amassing
outside the shield.

1292
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,640
Lock down the base.
Lock it down.

1293
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,480
And close the shield? Do it!

1294
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,560
Red and Gold Squadrons,
attack formations.

1295
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,160
Defend the fleet.

1296
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,280
Blue Squadron,
get to the surface

1297
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:32,680
before they close that gate.

1298
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:33,640
Copy you, Admiral.

1299
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:35,480
Blue Squadron, on me!

1300
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:36,360
Copy, Blue Leader.

1301
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,360
Copy, Blue Leader.
We won't have long.

1302
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:53,080
Close the field
aperture now! Close it!

1303
01:38:58,440 --> 01:38:59,480
Come on, come on, come on!

1304
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:01,160
Pull up!

1305
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:14,840
The rebel fleet has arrived.

1306
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
What?

1307
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:17,640
There's fighting on the beach.

1308
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,720
They've locked down the base.

1309
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,040
They've closed the shield gate.

1310
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:22,520
What does that mean?

1311
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:26,080
We're trapped?

1312
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:30,520
We could transmit the plans
to the rebel fleet.

1313
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:33,800
We'd have to get a signal up
to tell them it's coming.

1314
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:35,176
It's the size of the data files.

1315
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:36,320
That's the problem.

1316
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,040
They'll never get through.

1317
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,680
Someone has to
take that shield gate down.

1318
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:43,200
Bodhi. Bodhi, can you hear me?

1319
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:45,080
Bodhi, tell me you're out there.

1320
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:47,160
Bodhi?

1321
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:48,680
I'm here.

1322
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:49,880
I was standing by.

1323
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:51,656
They've started fighting.
The base is on lockdown.

1324
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:54,520
I know. Listen to me.
The rebel fleet is up there.

1325
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,816
You've gotta tell them to
blow a hole in the shield gate...

1326
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,920
so we can transmit the plans.

1327
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:02,200
Wait. I can't. I'm not
hooked into the comms tower.

1328
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:03,480
We're not tied in.

1329
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:05,560
It's the only way we're
getting them out of here.

1330
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:06,720
Find a way!

1331
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:08,600
Cover our backs.

1332
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,880
You'll need this.

1333
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:15,240
You wanted one, right?

1334
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:22,520
Your behavior, Jyn Erso,
is continually unexpected.

1335
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:25,400
Jyn. Come on.

1336
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:46,160
Sa'kalla!

1337
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:48,080
Fire on my command.

1338
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,360
Look!

1339
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:17,040
Get ready. We're gonna
have to go out there.

1340
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:20,760
What are you doing?

1341
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:23,560
They've closed the shield gate.

1342
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:25,320
We're stuck here.

1343
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,880
But the rebel fleet
are pulling in.

1344
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:29,216
We just have to get a signal strong
enough to get through to them...

1345
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:31,480
and let them know that
we're trapped down here.

1346
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:33,616
For that, we have to connect
to the communications tower.

1347
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:35,800
Now, I can patch us in
over here, the landing pad.

1348
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:37,240
But you have to
get on the radio.

1349
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:40,400
Get one of the guys out there
to find a master switch.

1350
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:41,776
Get them to activate
the connection

1351
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,080
between us and that comms tower.

1352
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:43,800
Okay?

1353
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,320
Then go!

1354
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:50,680
What's going on down
there, Lieutenant?

1355
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:52,040
Unknown, sir.

1356
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,320
We can't raise them.

1357
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:54,680
All rebel frequencies
are blocked.

1358
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,960
Keep trying. Engage
those Star Destroyers

1359
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,920
and let's start
probing that shield!

1360
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,240
Yes, sir!

1361
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,360
We're going in.

1362
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:11,360
Stay with me.

1363
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:50,080
Schematic bank, data tower two.

1364
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:51,360
How do I find that?

1365
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:52,920
Searching.

1366
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:54,920
I can locate the tape,

1367
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,240
but you'll need to use
the handles for extraction.

1368
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,720
What am I supposed
to do with this?

1369
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:06,400
Whoa!

1370
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:22,920
Well, finally.

1371
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,400
Wait! Stop!

1372
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:27,400
The rebels,
they went over there.

1373
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,800
K, what's going on out there?

1374
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:31,040
There's one.

1375
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:32,920
Well.

1376
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:44,960
Come on!

1377
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:54,280
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1378
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,680
We're starting our attack run
on the shield gate.

1379
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:59,080
Keep it tight, and watch out
for those towers.

1380
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:16,000
More fighters.
Form out at six-five.

1381
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:19,640
Sir, enemy fighters coming in.

1382
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:29,120
Melshi! Melshi,
come in. Are you there?

1383
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,520
Bodhi sent a signal from here.
He's patching us in.

1384
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,640
But you guys have to open up
a line for the tower.

1385
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,360
How? Please advise.

1386
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,840
There's a master switch
at the base of the comm tower.

1387
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,440
Master switch? Describe.
What are we looking for?

1388
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:43,760
What does it look like? The
master switch? Where is it?

1389
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:46,520
U-wings, reinforce
those troops on the beach.

1390
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,160
All fighters, on me.

1391
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,840
We have to shield them
from air attack.

1392
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:53,840
Troop reinforcements.
Here we go.

1393
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:58,000
For Jedha!

1394
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:07,400
We're having no effect
on that shield.

1395
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,320
How much more can
that thing take?

1396
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:14,240
Stick close, Red Five.
Where are you goin'?

1397
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:17,040
They're all over me.
I'm trying to lose them!

1398
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,560
This is Red Five! I need help!

1399
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:29,640
"Hyperspace tracking.
Navigational systems."

1400
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:32,400
Two screens down.

1401
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:34,480
"Structural engineering."
Open that one.

1402
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:37,880
I've got one on my tail!

1403
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:39,920
I'm on him!

1404
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:58,240
Project code names: "Stellarsphere,
Mark Omega, Pax Aurora."

1405
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:14,560
"War-Mantle, Cluster
Prism, Blacksaber."

1406
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:16,280
What?

1407
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:17,760
"Stardust."

1408
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:21,000
That's it.

1409
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:22,920
How do you know that?

1410
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:25,240
I know because it's me.

1411
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,880
Hey, you! Identify yourself.

1412
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:35,800
I can...

1413
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:37,720
Incoming fire! Get cover!

1414
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,920
K, we need
the file for Stardust.

1415
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:52,920
Stardust.

1416
01:46:57,120 --> 01:46:58,120
That's it.

1417
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,680
K?

1418
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:22,120
Climb.

1419
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,240
Climb.

1420
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:27,040
You can still send
the plans to the fleet.

1421
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,320
If they open the shield gate...

1422
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:31,640
you can broadcast
from the tower.

1423
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:34,160
Locking the vault door now.

1424
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:35,280
K?

1425
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:36,360
K!

1426
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:37,960
Goodbye. K!

1427
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,960
Sir, unauthorized access
at the data vault.

1428
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:00,120
What?

1429
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:01,720
It's just come in, sir.

1430
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:07,360
Send my guard squadron
into battle.

1431
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:09,200
Two men with me, now.

1432
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:12,400
Get that beach under control!

1433
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,200
Bodhi, are you there?
Did you call the fleet?

1434
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:18,160
I can't get to the shuttle.

1435
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:20,520
I can't plug in.

1436
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:23,240
You have to. They
have to hit that gate.

1437
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,760
If the shield's open,
we can send the plans.

1438
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:58,120
General, behind you!

1439
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:12,480
Step back.

1440
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:23,200
We're going down!

1441
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:30,120
Come on!

1442
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,040
Melshi, Melshi.

1443
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:34,520
Come in, please.

1444
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:35,880
I'm tied in at my end.

1445
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:37,080
I just need an open line.

1446
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:38,800
Hang on.

1447
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:41,520
The master switch.

1448
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:44,080
It's over near that console.

1449
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:48,880
I'm going!

1450
01:50:58,400 --> 01:50:59,560
I've got it!

1451
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:02,880
Careful!

1452
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:04,760
You okay?

1453
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,080
Jyn!

1454
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:35,400
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

1455
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:37,696
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

1456
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:38,720
Chirrut!

1457
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:51,440
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.

1458
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:53,360
I'm one with the Force,
the Force is with me.

1459
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:54,440
I'm one with the Force...

1460
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:56,600
the Force is with me.
I'm one with the Force...

1461
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:57,760
and the Force is with me.

1462
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:00,120
I'm one with the Force,
and the Force is with me.

1463
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:02,480
I'm one with the Force,
and the Force is with me.

1464
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:05,000
Chirrut! Come back!

1465
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:06,240
I'm one with the Force...

1466
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:15,640
Yes!

1467
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:21,440
Keep going! Keep going!

1468
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,880
Cassian!

1469
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:39,440
Chirrut! Come! Come with me!

1470
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:45,640
Chirrut!

1471
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:52,320
Chirrut.

1472
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:54,880
Don't go. Don't go.

1473
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:56,560
I'm here, I'm here.

1474
01:52:57,400 --> 01:52:58,800
It's okay.

1475
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:03,120
It's okay. Look for the Force.

1476
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:04,640
Chirrut.

1477
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:07,480
And you will always find me.

1478
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:12,240
The Force is with me
and I'm one with the Force.

1479
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:17,520
The Force is with me
and I'm one with the Force.

1480
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,800
The Force is with me
and I'm one with the Force.

1481
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:39,240
Deflector shields down to 50%!
We're sustaining heavy damage!

1482
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:41,360
There's no turning back now!

1483
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,040
We have to press the attack!

1484
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:50,480
Hit that opening!

1485
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:51,720
We see it, Gold Leader.

1486
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:53,400
Ion torpedoes away!

1487
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:04,360
What's happening?

1488
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:06,160
We've lost engine power, sir.

1489
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:11,280
That Star Destroyer's disabled.

1490
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,656
This is Rogue One calling
any Alliance ships

1491
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:15,880
that can hear me.

1492
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:19,256
Is there anybody out there?
This is Rogue One.

1493
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:20,320
Come in, over!

1494
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:22,680
This is Admiral Raddus,
Rogue One. We hear you.

1495
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:26,920
We have the plans.

1496
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:28,976
They found the Death Star plans.

1497
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,056
They have to transmit them
from the communications tower.

1498
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:32,416
You have to take down
the shield gate.

1499
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:34,440
It's the only way they're
gonna get them through.

1500
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:38,640
Call up a Hammerhead
corvette. I have an idea.

1501
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,360
Stand by, Rogue One.
We're on it.

1502
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,200
This is for you, Galen.

1503
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:14,560
The Force is with me,
and I'm one with the Force.

1504
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:07,320
Corvette Five, locked on target!

1505
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:10,000
Prepare for impact.

1506
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:23,840
Sublight thrusters, full power!

1507
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:02,920
Reset antenna alignment.

1508
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:05,960
Reset antenna alignment.

1509
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:09,000
Reset antenna alignment.

1510
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:12,280
Reset antenna alignment.

1511
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:38,240
Reverse engines! Full power!

1512
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:00,640
Antenna aligned.

1513
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:02,240
Ready to transmit.

1514
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:38,080
Who are you?

1515
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:41,680
You know who I am.

1516
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:45,880
I'm Jyn Erso.

1517
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,480
Daughter of Galen and Lyra.

1518
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:50,040
You've lost.

1519
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:52,200
I have, have I?

1520
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:54,000
My father's revenge.

1521
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:55,680
He built a flaw
in the Death Star.

1522
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:57,760
He put a fuse in the middle
of your machine...

1523
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:00,000
and I've just told the
entire galaxy how to light it.

1524
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:03,360
The shield is up.

1525
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:05,880
Your signal will never
reach the rebel base.

1526
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:08,120
All your ships in the air
will be destroyed.

1527
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:10,080
I lose nothing but time.

1528
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:12,320
You, on the other hand...

1529
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:15,520
die with the Rebellion.

1530
01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:47,400
Transmitting.

1531
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:50,760
Transmitting.

1532
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:55,880
Admiral, receiving
transmission from Scarif.

1533
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:07,280
Leave it, leave it!

1534
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:08,640
That's it.

1535
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:11,040
That's it.

1536
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:13,520
Let's go.

1537
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:15,560
Transmission received.

1538
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:17,960
Admiral, we have the plans!

1539
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:19,600
She did it!

1540
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:24,280
Do you think
anybody's listening?

1541
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:26,440
I do.

1542
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:29,960
Someone's out there.

1543
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:34,160
Sir, we're detecting
a massive object

1544
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:36,440
emerging from hyperspace.

1545
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:44,120
Sir, shall I begin
targeting their fleet?

1546
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:45,560
Lord Vader will
handle the fleet.

1547
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:49,800
Target the base at Scarif,
single reactor ignition.

1548
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:51,200
Yes, sir.

1549
02:00:56,440 --> 02:00:57,440
Come on.

1550
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:23,400
You may fire when ready.

1551
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:29,960
Commence primary ignition.

1552
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:55,400
Rogue One,
may the Force be with you.

1553
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:02,600
All ships prepare
for jump to hyperspace.

1554
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:37,240
Your father would have been
proud of you, Jyn.

1555
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:53,840
The rebel flagship is
disabled, my lord...

1556
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,200
but has received
transmissions from the surface.

1557
02:02:56,680 --> 02:02:58,920
Prepare a boarding party.

1558
02:02:59,160 --> 02:03:00,600
Yes, my lord.

1559
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:37,560
Hurry!

1560
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:43,240
Let's go! We gotta go, now!

1561
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:46,720
Move! Move! Move!

1562
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:49,080
Hurry. Let's go!

1563
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:50,240
Let's go!

1564
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:51,320
It's stuck!

1565
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:53,720
Hey!

1566
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:55,360
Hey! Help!

1567
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:13,360
Open fire!

1568
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:20,440
Help us!

1569
02:04:24,280 --> 02:04:25,280
It's jammed!

1570
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:27,320
Pull it!

1571
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:33,800
Pull it!

1572
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:39,000
Here! Here!

1573
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:40,680
Take it! Take it!

1574
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:49,560
Launch!

1575
02:05:17,240 --> 02:05:18,920
Make sure you
secure the airlock.

1576
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:20,800
And prepare the escape pods.

1577
02:05:25,160 --> 02:05:26,160
Your highness.

1578
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:28,760
The transmission we received.

1579
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:31,440
What is it they've sent us?

1580
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:34,600
Hope.
