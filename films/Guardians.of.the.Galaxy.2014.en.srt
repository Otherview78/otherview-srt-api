1
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:37,955
Peter.

2
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,543
Your momma wants to speak with you.

3
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:48,799
Come on, Pete. Take these fool things off.

4
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,878
Why have you been fighting with the other boys again, baby?

5
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:29,674
Peter?

6
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:33,344
They killed a little frog that ain't done nothing.

7
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,514
Smushed it with a stick.

8
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:40,184
You're so like your daddy.

9
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,853
You even look like him.

10
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,190
And he was an angel.

11
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:50,319
- Composed out of pure light. - Mer?

12
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:52,405
You got a present there for Peter, don't you?

13
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,908
Of course.

14
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,204
There.

15
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,708
I've got you covered, Pete.

16
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,964
You open it up when I'm gone, okay?

17
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,051
Your grandpa...

18
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,596
...is gonna take such good care of you.

19
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:21,559
At least until your daddy comes back to get you.

20
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:26,397
Take my hand.

21
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,652
Peter.

22
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,238
Pete, come on.

23
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,365
Take my hand.

24
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:43,456
Mom?

25
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,792
No! No! No! No!

26
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,252
Mom! No!

27
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,920
- Come with me. - No!

28
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:51,797
No!

29
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,716
You've got to stay here. Please.

30
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,259
No...

31
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,095
Okay?

32
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,699
No.

33
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,967
Mom!

34
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,509
Drop it!

35
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,094
Uh, hey.

36
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,847
- Drop it, now! - Hey, cool, man. No problem.

37
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,933
No problem at all.

38
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,268
How do you know about this?

39
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,937
I don't even know what that is.

40
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:42,523
I'm just a junker, man. I was just checking stuff out.

41
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:45,109
You don't look like a junker. You're wearing Ravager garb.

42
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,527
This is just an outfit, man.

43
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,028
Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.

44
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,196
What is your name?

45
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,281
My name is Peter Quill, okay? Dude, chill out.

46
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,033
- Move! - Why?

47
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,077
Ronan may have questions for you.

48
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:56,620
Hey, you know what?

49
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,872
There's another name you might know me by.

50
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,501
Star-Lord.

51
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:03,836
Who?

52
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,213
Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw.

53
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,717
- Guys? - Move!

54
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,803
Ah, forget this.

55
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:42,803
Subtitle www.movieddl.me

56
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,123
Peter?

57
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,087
What happened?

58
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,506
Hey, uh...

59
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,675
Uh... I...

60
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,427
- Bereet. - Bereet!

61
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,055
Look, I'm gonna be totally honest with you. I forgot you're here.

62
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,539
Scattered riots broke out

63
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,165
across the Kree Empire today

64
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:50,752
protesting the recent peace treaty signed by the Kree Emperor

65
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,297
and Xandar's Nova Prime.

66
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,217
Peter, you have call.

67
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,720
- No, wait, don't! - Quill?

68
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,473
Hey, Yondu.

69
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,642
I'm here on Morag.

70
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,019
Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.

71
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,229
Well, I was in the neighbourhood. I thought I'd save you the hassle.

72
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,647
Well, where are you at now, boy?

73
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,275
I feel really bad about this, but I'm not gonna tell you that.

74
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,861
- I slaved putting this deal together. - Slaved?

75
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,070
Making a few calls is "slaved"? I mean, really?

76
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,155
And now you're gonna rip me off!

77
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,742
We do not do that to each other. We're Ravagers. We got a code.

78
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,620
Yeah, and that code is "steal from everybody."

79
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,038
When I picked you up on Terra...

80
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,164
"Picked me up."

81
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,248
...these boys of mine wanted to eat you.

82
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,333
Yeah?

83
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,709
They ain't never tasted any Terran before.

84
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,086
I stopped them. You're alive because of me!

85
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,421
I will find you, I will...

86
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,757
Put a bounty on him!

87
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,550
Forty K.

88
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,260
- But I want him back alive. - Yeah, Cap.

89
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,803
- Alive? - That's what I said.

90
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,305
I told you when you picked that kid up,

91
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,349
you should have delivered him like we was hired to do!

92
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,017
He was cargo!

93
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,769
You have always been soft on him.

94
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,396
You're the only one I'm being soft on!

95
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,358
Now, don't you worry about Mr Quill.

96
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,818
As soon as we get him back here,

97
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,780
I'm gonna kill him myself.

98
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,531
What we do need to worry about,

99
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,369
is who else out there wants that Orb!

100
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,016
They call me "terrorist, "

101
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:31,269
"radical, '' "zealot, "

102
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:35,273
because I obey the ancient laws of my people, the Kree,

103
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,528
and punish those who do not.

104
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:42,781
Because I do not forgive your people

105
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,450
for taking the life of my father,

106
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,496
and his father, and his father before him.

107
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:55,335
A thousand years of war between us will not be forgotten!

108
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,630
You can't do this! Our government signed a peace treaty.

109
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:02,092
My government knows no shame.

110
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,013
You Xandarians and your culture are a disease.

111
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,432
You

112
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,851
will never rule Xandar.

113
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:11,977
No.

114
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,022
I will cure it!

115
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,286
Ronan,

116
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,288
Korath has returned.

117
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,249
Master, he is a thief,

118
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,752
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

119
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,379
But we have discovered he has an agreement

120
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,299
to retrieve the Orb for an intermediary known

121
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:43,925
as The Broker.

122
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:47,512
I promised Thanos I would retrieve the Orb for him.

123
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:50,182
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.

124
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,478
Nebula, go to Xandar and get me the Orb.

125
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,396
It will be my honour.

126
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,564
It will be your doom.

127
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,318
If this happens again, you'll be facing our father

128
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,195
without his prize.

129
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:04,780
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

130
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,448
Just like you.

131
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,866
But I know Xandar.

132
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,659
Ronan has already decreed that I...

133
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:10,786
Do not speak for me.

134
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,290
You will not fail.

135
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,629
Have I ever?

136
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,521
Xandarians.

137
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,856
What a bunch of losers.

138
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,361
All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid,

139
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,530
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

140
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:47,948
Look at this guy!

141
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,616
Can you believe they call us criminals,

142
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,618
when he's assaulting us with that haircut?

143
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,913
What is this thing? Look how it thinks it's so cool.

144
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,542
It's not cool to get help! Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

145
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,627
Look at Mr Smiles over here.

146
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:05,006
Where's your wife, old man? What a class-A prevert.

147
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,217
Right, Groot?

148
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:08,802
Groot?

149
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,720
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

150
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,098
- That's disgusting! - Mmm.

151
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,475
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

152
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,685
Why are you lying?

153
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,103
Whoop.

154
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,232
Looks like we got one.

155
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,403
Okay, humie, how bad does someone wanna find you?

156
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:32,033
40,000 units? Groot, we're gonna be rich.

157
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,340
- Mr Quill. - Broker.

158
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,718
The Orb.

159
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,763
- As commissioned. - Where's Yondu?

160
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,599
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.

161
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:56,725
And told me to tell you,

162
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,060
that you got the best eyebrows in the business.

163
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:02,314
What is it?

164
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:06,443
It's my policy never to discuss my clients, or their needs.

165
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,528
Yeah, well, I almost died getting it for you.

166
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,615
An occupational hazard, I'm sure, in your line of work.

167
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,534
Some machine-headed freak, working for a dude named Ronan.

168
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,871
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr Quill.

169
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,039
I truly am.

170
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,790
But I want no part of this transaction

171
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,792
- if Ronan is involved. - Whoa, whoa, whoa!

172
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,961
Who's Ronan?

173
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,381
A Kree fanatic, outraged by the peace treaty,

174
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:32,761
who will not rest until Xandarian culture, my culture,

175
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,054
- is wiped from existence! - Whoa, whoa!

176
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,513
- Come on. - He's someone

177
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,015
whose bad side I'd rather not be on.

178
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,808
What? What about my bad side?

179
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,227
Farewell, Mr Quill.

180
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,939
Hey, we had a deal, bro!

181
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,071
What happened?

182
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:56,243
Ah, this guy just backed out of a deal on me.

183
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,495
If there's one thing I hate, it's a man without integrity.

184
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,330
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

185
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,084
You have the bearing of a man of honour.

186
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,336
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

187
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,048
People say it about me, all the time,

188
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,675
but it's not something I would ever say about myself.

189
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,678
Ooh!

190
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,611
This wasn't the plan.

191
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,571
Ah!

192
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,324
Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag!

193
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,702
No! Not her, him!

194
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,287
Learn genders, man.

195
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:41,997
Ow!

196
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,832
Biting? That's not fair!

197
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,962
Take it easy!

198
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,720
Ow!

199
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,367
Fool. You should have learned.

200
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,286
I don't learn. One of my issues.

201
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,629
What the...

202
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:38,011
Quit smiling, you idiot. You're supposed to be a professional.

203
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:40,805
You gotta be kidding me.

204
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,599
Ooh. Hey!

205
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,702
I live for the simple things.

206
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,080
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

207
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:12,003
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

208
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,590
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

209
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,217
Quit whining.

210
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,812
Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.

211
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,980
Aw, crap.

212
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,565
By the authority of the Nova Corps,

213
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,442
- you are under arrest... - All right. Come on up.

214
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:36,736
...for endangerment to life and the destruction of property.

215
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,906
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

216
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:43,284
- Star-Lord. - Oh, sorry. "Lord."

217
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,537
I picked this guy up a while back for petty theft.

218
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,080
He's got a code name.

219
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,206
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

220
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,166
Come on, man. It's a... It's an outlaw name.

221
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,960
Just relax, pal.

222
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:54,254
It's cool to have a code name. It's not that weird.

223
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,257
Fascists.

224
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:11,855
Ronan is destroying

225
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,107
Xandarian outposts throughout the galaxy.

226
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:18,194
I should think that would call for some slight response on the part of the Kree.

227
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:19,988
We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime.

228
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,281
What more do you want?

229
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,158
At least a statement from the Kree Empire

230
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,493
saying that they condemn his actions.

231
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,079
He is slaughtering children.

232
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,581
Families.

233
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,041
That is your business.

234
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,169
Now, I have other matters to attend to.

235
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:36,588
Prick.

236
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:40,216
Well, some good news.

237
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:43,428
It looks like we've apprehended one of Ronan's compatriots.

238
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,096
Gamora.

239
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:48,141
Surgically modified and trained as a living weapon.

240
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,810
The adopted daughter of the Mad Titan, Thanos.

241
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:54,355
Recently, Thanos lent her and her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

242
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,734
which leads us to believe that Thanos and Ronan are working together.

243
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:02,071
Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."

244
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,740
The result of illegal genetic

245
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,325
and cybernetic experiments

246
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,618
on a lower life form.

247
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,786
What the hell?

248
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,705
They call it "Groot."

249
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:13,333
A humanoid plant that's been travelling recently

250
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,586
as 89P13's personal houseplant/muscle.

251
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,757
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

252
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:24,010
Raised from youth by a band of mercenaries called the Ravagers,

253
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,929
led by Yondu Udonta.

254
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,555
Oh, I'm sorry.

255
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,600
I didn't know how this machine worked.

256
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,852
What a bunch of a-holes.

257
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,855
Transport all four to the Kyln.

258
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:42,070
I guess most of Nova Corps wanna uphold the laws,

259
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:45,615
but these ones here, they're corrupt and cruel.

260
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,992
But, hey, that's not my problem.

261
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,702
I ain't gonna be here long.

262
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,289
I've escaped 22 prisons. This one's no different.

263
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,749
You're lucky the broad showed up,

264
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,042
because otherwise, me and Groot

265
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,961
would be collecting that bounty right now,

266
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,963
and you'd be getting drawn and quartered

267
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,089
by Yondu and those Ravagers.

268
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,341
I've had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years.

269
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,219
I ain't about to be brought down by a tree and a talking raccoon.

270
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,303
Hold.

271
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,305
- What's a raccoon? - "What's a raccoon?"

272
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:10,723
It's what you are, stupid.

273
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,643
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

274
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,604
So, this Orb has a real shiny blue suitcase,

275
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,732
Ark of the Covenant, Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

276
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,651
- What is it? - I am Groot.

277
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,444
So what? What's the Orb?

278
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,738
I have no words for an honourless thief.

279
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,116
Pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey

280
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:29,409
of a genocidal maniac.

281
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,411
Yeah, I know who you are.

282
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,496
Anyone who's anyone knows who you are.

283
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,164
Yeah, we know who you are.

284
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,750
- Who is she? - I am Groot.

285
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,794
Yeah, you said that.

286
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,006
I wasn't retrieving the Orb for Ronan.

287
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,799
I was betraying him.

288
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:46,968
I had an agreement to sell it to a third party.

289
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,263
I am Groot.

290
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,684
Well, that's just as fascinating as the first 89 times you told me that.

291
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,853
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

292
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,272
Well, he don't know talking good like me and you.

293
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:03,443
So his vocabulistics is limited to "I" and "am" and "Groot."

294
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,153
Exclusively in that order.

295
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,530
I tell you what, that's gonna wear real thin, real fast.

296
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,116
Hey.

297
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,367
Put that away.

298
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,786
Hey!

299
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,122
Listen to me, you big blue bastard. Take those headphones off.

300
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,915
That's mine. Those belong to impound.

301
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,917
That tape and that player is mine!

302
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,466
Hooked on a Feeling, Blue Swede, 1973.

303
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,051
That song belongs to me!

304
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:50,717
- You first! You first! - Murderer!

305
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,720
Coming for you first, Gamora! You're dead!

306
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:58,057
You're scum! You're scum!

307
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,145
It's like I said,

308
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,188
she's got a rep.

309
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:06,149
A lot of prisoners here have lost their families

310
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,401
to Ronan and his goons.

311
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,694
She'll last a day, tops.

312
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:11,070
Murderer!

313
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:12,655
The guards will protect her, right?

314
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:15,366
They're here to stop us from getting out.

315
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,452
They don't care what we do to each other inside.

316
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:21,080
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

317
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,876
are dreams compared to what's behind me.

318
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,755
Check out the new meat.

319
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:32,592
I'm gonna slather you up in Gunavian jelly,

320
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,051
and go to town...

321
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,475
Let's make something clear.

322
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,687
This one here is our booty!

323
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,190
You wanna get to him,

324
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,525
you go through us!

325
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,695
Or, more accurately,

326
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,573
we go through you.

327
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,376
I'm with them.

328
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,588
I hate you.

329
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,925
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

330
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,688
You're dead!

331
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:29,232
Dead!

332
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:56,926
Take her down to the showers.

333
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,136
It'll be easier to clean up the blood down there.

334
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,193
Quill, where you going?

335
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:16,571
Quill.

336
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,365
Quill!

337
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:22,910
Gamora, consider this a death sentence

338
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,204
for your crimes against the galaxy.

339
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:26,497
You dare?

340
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,547
You know who I am, yes?

341
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,549
You're Drax.

342
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,801
The Destroyer.

343
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:39,969
Quill!

344
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,971
And you know why they call me this.

345
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,682
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.

346
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:48,227
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

347
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,688
and my daughter, Camaria.

348
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,274
He slaughtered them where they stood.

349
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,985
And he laughed!

350
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,069
Quill?

351
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,279
Her life

352
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,032
is not yours to take.

353
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:05,036
He killed my family.

354
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:06,913
I shall kill one of his in return.

355
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:10,374
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

356
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,633
Quill! What are you doing?

357
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:22,428
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

358
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,731
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

359
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,650
Ah!

360
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,361
Woman, your words mean nothing to me!

361
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,030
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! - Oh, crap.

362
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:43,366
You know, if killing Ronan is truly your sole purpose,

363
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:44,784
I don't think this is the best way to go about it.

364
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,537
Are you not the man this wench attempted to kill?

365
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:49,914
Well, I mean, she's hardly the first woman

366
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,040
to try and do that to me.

367
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:54,377
Look, this is from a smoking-hot Rajak girl.

368
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:55,962
Stabbed me with a fork.

369
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:58,089
Didn't like me skipping out on her at sunrise.

370
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:00,675
I got, right here, a Kree girl tried to rip out my thorax.

371
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,885
She caught me with this skinny little A'askavariian

372
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:04,011
who worked in Nova Records.

373
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:05,721
I was trying to get information.

374
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,515
You ever see an A'askavariian?

375
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,392
They have tentacles, and needles for teeth.

376
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,811
If you think I'm seriously interested in that, then...

377
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,356
You don't care. But here's the point.

378
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,902
She betrayed Ronan. He's coming back for her.

379
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,696
And when he does,

380
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,115
that's when you...

381
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:27,743
Why would I put my finger on his throat?

382
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,245
What?

383
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,540
Oh, no, it's a symbol.

384
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:36,877
This is a symbol for you slicing his throat.

385
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,380
I would not slice his throat.

386
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,174
I would cut his head clean off.

387
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,385
It's a general expression for you killing somebody.

388
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:46,095
You've heard of this. You've seen this, right?

389
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,179
- You know what that is. - Yeah. Yeah.

390
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:49,390
- Everyone knows. - No, no.

391
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,478
What I'm saying is, you want to keep her alive.

392
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,565
Don't do his work for him.

393
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:12,955
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

394
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,167
- That was my favourite knife. - Listen!

395
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,420
I could care less whether you live or whether you die.

396
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:22,298
- Then why stop the big guy? - Simple.

397
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,091
You know where to sell my Orb.

398
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:26,469
How are we gonna sell it when we and it are still here?

399
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,804
My friend Rocket, here,

400
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,639
has escaped 22 prisons.

401
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,475
Oh, we're getting out.

402
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,478
And then we're headed straight to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

403
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:39,273
How much was your buyer willing to pay you for my Orb?

404
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:41,817
Four billion units.

405
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:43,527
- What? - Holy shit.

406
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:47,490
That Orb is my opportunity to get away from Thanos and Ronan.

407
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,450
If you free us,

408
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,828
I'll lead you to the buyer directly

409
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:54,622
and I'll split the profit between the three of us.

410
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,499
I am Groot.

411
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:57,958
Four of us.

412
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,127
Asleep for the danger, awake for the money,

413
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:01,212
as per frickin' usual.

414
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:05,633
You have been betrayed, Ronan.

415
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,843
We know only that she has been captured.

416
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,930
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

417
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:15,351
No! Our sources within the Kyln say Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.

418
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:18,062
Look, your partnership with Thanos

419
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:19,980
is at risk.

420
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:24,485
Thanos requires your presence. Now!

421
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:34,120
With all due respect, Thanos, your daughter made this mess,

422
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,704
and yet you summon me.

423
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,706
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

424
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,875
First, she lost a battle with some primitive.

425
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,752
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

426
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,630
Then she was apprehended by the Nova Corps.

427
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,632
You are the one here with nothing to show for it.

428
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:50,803
Your sources say that she meant to betray us the whole time!

429
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,179
Lower your tone!

430
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:53,347
I may be your...

431
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:05,442
I only ask that you take this matter seriously.

432
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:10,281
The only matter I do not take seriously, boy,

433
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:11,949
is you.

434
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,202
Your politics bore me.

435
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:18,455
Your demeanour is that of a pouty child.

436
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:23,252
And, apparently, you alienated my favourite daughter, Gamora.

437
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,799
I shall honour our agreement, Kree,

438
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:30,676
if you bring me the Orb.

439
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:34,096
But return to me again empty-handed,

440
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,600
and I will bathe the star ways in your blood.

441
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,813
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

442
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:47,860
This is one fight you won't win.

443
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,779
Let's head to the Kyln.

444
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,497
If we're gonna get out of here,

445
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:02,333
we're gonna need to get into that watchtower.

446
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,168
And to do that, I'm gonna need a few things.

447
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,795
The guards wear security bands

448
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,340
to control their ins and outs. I need one.

449
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,175
Leave it to me.

450
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:14,178
That dude, there. I need his prosthetic leg.

451
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,930
- His leg? - Yeah.

452
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,140
God knows I don't need the rest of him. Look at him, he's useless.

453
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:19,642
All right.

454
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:24,021
And finally, on the wall back there is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

455
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:26,190
- Do you see it? - Yeah.

456
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:30,402
There's a quarnyx battery behind it. Purplish box, green wires.

457
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,655
To get into that watchtower, I definitely need it.

458
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,156
How are we supposed to do that?

459
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,533
Well, supposably, these bald-bodies find you attractive.

460
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:38,244
So, maybe you can work out some sort of trade.

461
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:39,495
You must be joking.

462
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,372
No, I really heard they find you attractive.

463
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:43,082
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

464
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,584
and it's in the middle of the most heavily-guarded part of the prison.

465
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:48,420
It's impossible to get up there without being seen.

466
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:49,546
I got one plan,

467
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,757
and that plan requires a frickin' quarnyx battery,

468
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,925
so figure it out!

469
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,134
Oh!

470
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,262
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

471
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:58,264
Now, this is important.

472
00:34:58,347 --> 00:34:59,932
Once the battery is removed,

473
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,434
everything is gonna slam into emergency mode.

474
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:05,229
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,

475
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:08,190
so you definitely need to get that last.

476
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,031
Or we could just get it first and improvise.

477
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:18,200
- I'll get the armband. - Leg.

478
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:31,297
Prisoner,

479
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,258
drop the device immediately and retreat to your cell,

480
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:36,302
or we will open fire.

481
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,393
I am

482
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,271
Groot!

483
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:48,814
Fire!

484
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,746
All prisoners return to your sleeping areas.

485
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:10,753
You idiot!

486
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,589
How am I supposed to fight these things without my stuff?

487
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,305
The animal is in control.

488
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:23,515
Fire on my command!

489
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,328
Creepy little beast!

490
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,962
Oh, yeah.

491
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:07,726
You need my what?

492
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,411
- I'll need this. - Good luck.

493
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,954
It's internally wired.

494
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:28,747
I'll figure something out.

495
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,877
Drop the leg!

496
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:36,547
Drop the leg and move back to your cell!

497
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:52,813
Rocket!

498
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,985
Move to the watchtower!

499
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,017
You!

500
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,603
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

501
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,106
It was one time, man.

502
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,444
We need all available guards in full combat gear...

503
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:56,919
Whoa!

504
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,301
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

505
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:06,470
Why is this one here?

506
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,515
We promised him he could stay by your side until he kills your boss.

507
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:10,933
I always keep my promises,

508
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,643
when they're to muscle-bound whack-jobs

509
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:13,977
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

510
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,396
Oh, I was just kidding about the leg.

511
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,606
I just need these two things.

512
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,399
- What? - No, I thought it'd be funny.

513
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,567
Was it funny?

514
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,402
Oh, wait, what did he look like hopping around?

515
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:24,446
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

516
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:28,450
How are we going to leave?

517
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:32,037
Well, he's got a plan.

518
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:33,872
Right? Or is that another thing you made up?

519
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:35,499
I have a plan! I have a plan!

520
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:37,251
Cease your yammering

521
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:38,961
and relieve us from this irksome confinement.

522
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,462
Yeah, I'll have to agree with the walking thesaurus

523
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,381
on that one.

524
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,967
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

525
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:46,802
It's just a metaphor, dude.

526
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:49,846
His people are completely literal. Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

527
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,557
Nothing goes over my head.

528
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:54,810
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

529
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:59,314
I'm gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

530
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:06,822
Those are some big guns.

531
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,324
On my command!

532
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:11,243
Number one!

533
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:14,204
Rodent, we are ready for your plan.

534
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,123
Hold on!

535
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,959
Number two!

536
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:21,628
I recognise this animal.

537
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:23,964
We'd roast them over a flame pit as children.

538
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,257
Their flesh was quite delicious.

539
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:26,592
Not helping!

540
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:27,759
Number three!

541
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,643
All fire on my command!

542
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,145
Three!

543
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:39,855
Two!

544
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:41,440
One!

545
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,581
He turned off the artificial gravity,

546
00:40:57,748 --> 00:40:59,708
everywhere but in here.

547
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,332
I told you I had a plan.

548
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,272
That was a pretty good plan.

549
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:05,732
Huh?

550
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:16,868
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

551
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:19,913
It's the Milano, the orange and blue one over in the corner.

552
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,748
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.

553
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:23,917
That's rude! They folded yours.

554
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,136
The Orb's there. Let's go.

555
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,888
- Wait, wait, wait. - What?

556
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:38,682
That bastard didn't put it back.

557
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:41,685
- Put what back? - Here.

558
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:43,562
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.

559
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:46,231
- How are you gonna possibly... - Just keep the Milano close by.

560
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,607
Go.

561
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,025
Go!

562
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:11,173
Ah, my neck!

563
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:17,137
Well, how's he gonna get to us?

564
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,556
He declined to share that information with me.

565
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:20,640
Well, screw this, then!

566
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,560
I ain't waiting around for some humie with a death wish.

567
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:24,936
You got the Orb, right?

568
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,688
Yes.

569
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:52,047
If we don't leave now, we will be blown to bits.

570
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,131
No!

571
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,217
We're not leaving without the Orb.

572
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,143
Behold.

573
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,778
This one shows spirit.

574
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:17,739
He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan.

575
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:20,325
Companion, what were you retrieving?

576
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,124
You're an imbecile.

577
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:38,635
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

578
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,136
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?

579
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,848
You can't take apart my ship without asking me!

580
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,850
- See, what is this? - Don't touch that!

581
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:45,934
It's a bomb.

582
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,018
- A bomb? - Yup.

583
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:48,812
And you leave it lying around?

584
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:50,522
I was gonna put it in a box.

585
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:51,731
What's a box gonna do?

586
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:54,025
- How about this one? - No! Whoa. Hey!

587
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,193
- Leave it alone. - Why? What is it?

588
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:56,778
- Shut up. - Hey!

589
00:44:58,071 --> 00:44:59,114
What is that?

590
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:01,992
That's for if things get really hardcore.

591
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,702
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

592
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,287
No one's blowing up moons.

593
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,539
You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.

594
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:09,791
So, listen, I'm gonna need your buyer's coordinates.

595
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:13,128
We're heading in the right direction. For now.

596
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,672
If we're gonna work together, you might try trusting me a little bit.

597
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,299
And how much do you trust me?

598
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:20,427
I'd trust you a lot more if you told me what this was.

599
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:24,264
Because I'm guessing it's some kind of weapon.

600
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:25,724
I don't know what it is.

601
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:28,101
If it's a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.

602
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:30,186
Put it down, you fool. You'll destroy us all.

603
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:31,313
Or just you, murderess!

604
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,064
I let you live once, princess!

605
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,275
- I am not a princess! - Hey!

606
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:38,987
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

607
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:43,241
We're stuck together until we get the money.

608
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,535
I have no interest in money.

609
00:45:45,702 --> 00:45:46,953
Great.

610
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:51,333
That means more money for the three of us.

611
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,543
Mmm?

612
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:55,712
For the four of us.

613
00:45:56,046 --> 00:45:57,213
Partners.

614
00:45:57,297 --> 00:45:58,882
We have an agreement,

615
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,508
but I would never be partners with the likes of you.

616
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,094
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

617
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:07,432
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

618
00:46:12,062 --> 00:46:13,605
Oh, she has no idea.

619
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:16,191
If I had a black light,

620
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,777
the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.

621
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,112
You got issues, Quill.

622
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:32,457
I swear. I don't know where they went! I swear.

623
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,668
If he knew where they were headed,

624
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,919
he would have already told us.

625
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,003
Yeah.

626
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,546
Ronan,

627
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:41,800
the Nova Corps sent a fleet to defend the prison.

628
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:42,884
Well, then,

629
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:46,221
send Necrocraft to every corner of the quadrant.

630
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:49,808
Find the Orb. Any means, any price.

631
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:51,351
And this place?

632
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:52,978
The Nova can't know what we're after.

633
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:56,398
Cleanse it!

634
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,277
Do you got any other cute little buggers like this one?

635
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,448
I like to stick 'em all in a row on my control console.

636
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:07,909
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

637
00:47:08,118 --> 00:47:10,203
He's being fully serious.

638
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,580
In that case, I can show you...

639
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:15,542
But first, you gonna tell me what this Orb is,

640
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,836
and why everybody cares so damn much about it.

641
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,171
And then you gonna tell me,

642
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,424
who out there might wanna buy it.

643
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,260
Sir, the high-end community is a...

644
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,265
The high-end community is a...

645
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,766
It's a tight-knit...

646
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:33,101
Tight-knit...

647
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:35,020
The high-end community is a very tight-knit...

648
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:37,647
I cannot possibly betray

649
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,899
the confidentiality of my buyers!

650
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,455
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

651
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,501
Carina.

652
00:47:58,585 --> 00:47:59,711
Yes, Master.

653
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:02,797
Your people do have elbows, do they not?

654
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:04,716
We do, Master.

655
00:48:04,883 --> 00:48:07,844
Then use them.

656
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:10,555
I don't have to remind you

657
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,683
what happened to the last attendant who disappointed me.

658
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,643
Do I?

659
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:22,484
Chop, chop. Our guests will be here soon.

660
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:28,865
Heads up! We're inbound.

661
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,548
Whoa.

662
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,302
What is it?

663
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:52,305
It's called Knowhere.

664
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:55,350
The severed head of an ancient celestial being.

665
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,560
Be wary headed in, rodent.

666
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:01,898
There are no regulations whatsoever here.

667
00:49:26,256 --> 00:49:29,134
Hundreds of years ago, the Tivan Group sent workers in

668
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:31,803
to mine the organic matter within the skull.

669
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:34,097
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.

670
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:39,102
All rare resources, highly valued in black markets across the galaxy.

671
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:43,064
It's dangerous and illegal work, suitable only for outlaws.

672
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:44,941
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws.

673
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:46,693
Billy the Kid,

674
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,820
Bonnie and Clyde, John Stamos.

675
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:50,488
It sounds like a place, which I would like to visit.

676
00:49:50,572 --> 00:49:51,614
Yeah, you should.

677
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:54,117
Excuse me.

678
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,578
- Watch your wallets. - Can you spare any units?

679
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:05,628
Get out of here.

680
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,844
Your buyer's in there?

681
00:50:13,303 --> 00:50:15,138
We are to wait here for his representative.

682
00:50:15,305 --> 00:50:16,764
Get out of here!

683
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:19,100
This is no respectable establishment.

684
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,311
What do you expect us to do while we wait?

685
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:24,230
Yes! Yes!

686
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:26,107
Whoa!

687
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,657
Yahoo!

688
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:43,416
My Orloni has won,

689
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,376
as I won at all things!

690
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:48,713
Now, let's put more of this liquid into our bodies.

691
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,842
That's the first thing you said that wasn't bat-shit crazy!

692
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,262
Man, you wouldn't believe what they charge for fuel out here.

693
00:50:56,346 --> 00:50:58,598
I might actually lose money on this job.

694
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:00,391
My connection is making us wait.

695
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:04,854
It's just a negotiation tactic. Trust me, this is my specialty.

696
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:06,898
Where yours is more,

697
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:09,901
"Stab, stab. Those are my terms."

698
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:12,612
My father didn't stress diplomacy.

699
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:13,821
Thanos?

700
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:16,950
He's not my father.

701
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:19,577
When Thanos took my home world,

702
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:21,996
he killed my parents in front of me.

703
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,415
He tortured me,

704
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,001
turned me into a weapon.

705
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:31,506
When he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for Ronan,

706
00:51:31,673 --> 00:51:33,633
I couldn't stand by and...

707
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:40,515
Why would you risk your life for this?

708
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,185
My mother gave it to me.

709
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:48,940
My mom liked sharing with me all the pop songs that she loved growing up.

710
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,024
I happened to have it on me,

711
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:52,360
when I was...

712
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:54,946
The day that she...

713
00:51:57,365 --> 00:51:59,117
You know, when I left Earth.

714
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,244
What do you do with it?

715
00:52:01,411 --> 00:52:05,081
Do? Nothing. You listen to it. Or you can dance.

716
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:09,877
I'm a warrior and an assassin. I do not dance.

717
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,212
Really?

718
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:15,550
On my planet, there's a legend about people like you.

719
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:17,010
It's called

720
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:18,553
Footloose.

721
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,724
And in it, a great hero

722
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,183
named Kevin Bacon,

723
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:29,772
teaches an entire city full of people with sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

724
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:32,900
It's the greatest thing there is.

725
00:52:33,735 --> 00:52:35,320
Who put the sticks up their butts?

726
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:36,904
What? No, that's just a...

727
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,865
- That is cruel. - It's just a phrase

728
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:41,242
people use.

729
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:01,929
The melody is pleasant!

730
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:21,199
- No! - Ow! What the hell?

731
00:53:21,366 --> 00:53:22,700
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

732
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:26,079
And I am not some starry-eyed waif here to succumb to your...

733
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,414
Your pelvic sorcery!

734
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:29,957
That is not what is happening here.

735
00:53:35,046 --> 00:53:36,923
Oh, no.

736
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,475
Stop it!

737
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:48,893
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

738
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:52,397
This vermin speaks of affairs he knows nothing about!

739
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,482
- That is true! - He has no respect!

740
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:56,984
- That is also true! - Hold on! Hold on!

741
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:59,153
Keep calling me vermin, tough guy!

742
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:01,406
You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!

743
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:04,117
Rocket, you're drunk. All right? No one's laughing at you.

744
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:06,994
He thinks I'm some stupid thing! He does!

745
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:09,163
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

746
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:11,666
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

747
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,751
and put back together, over and over

748
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:16,003
and turned into some...

749
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:17,296
Some little monster!

750
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:19,340
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

751
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:21,634
He called me "vermin"!

752
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:24,387
She called me "rodent"!

753
00:54:24,554 --> 00:54:25,930
Let's see if you can laugh

754
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:29,058
after five or six good shots to your frickin' face!

755
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:30,643
No, no, no, no!

756
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,979
Four billion units! Rocket!

757
00:54:33,146 --> 00:54:34,105
Come on, man. Hey!

758
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,189
Suck it up for one more lousy night

759
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:36,983
and you're rich.

760
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:46,868
Fine.

761
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:48,786
But I can't promise, when all this is over

762
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:50,538
I'm not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.

763
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:54,208
See? That's exactly why none of you have any friends!

764
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:57,462
Five seconds after you meet somebody, you're already trying to kill them!

765
00:54:57,545 --> 00:55:01,507
We have travelled, halfway across the quadrant.

766
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,676
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

767
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,097
- Drax! - Let him go.

768
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:09,474
We don't need him.

769
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,895
Milady Gamora.

770
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:15,897
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

771
00:55:22,195 --> 00:55:24,113
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

772
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:27,408
We house the galaxy's largest collection

773
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:30,578
of fauna, relics, and species of all manner.

774
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:38,419
I present to you,

775
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,590
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

776
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,523
Oh, my dear Gamora.

777
00:55:59,315 --> 00:56:01,734
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

778
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:04,445
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

779
00:56:04,946 --> 00:56:07,406
We have what we discussed.

780
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:12,912
What is that thing there?

781
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:14,789
I am Groot.

782
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,503
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

783
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:22,129
Sir...

784
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:26,092
You must allow me to pay you now so that I may own your carcass.

785
00:56:26,259 --> 00:56:29,136
At the moment of your death, of course.

786
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,513
I am Groot.

787
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,432
Why, so he could turn you into a frickin' chair?

788
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:34,559
That's your pet?

789
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:37,520
- His what? - Tivan.

790
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:41,899
We have been halfway around the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

791
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:44,110
Very well, then.

792
00:56:44,277 --> 00:56:46,779
Let us see what you brought.

793
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,170
Three quarnyx batteries, seven cases of Cotati seeds.

794
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:06,674
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

795
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:07,883
Uh...

796
00:57:08,301 --> 00:57:11,220
You shall send a message for me.

797
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:13,097
Oh, my new friends.

798
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:17,560
Before creation itself,

799
00:57:17,727 --> 00:57:19,437
there were six singularities.

800
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:25,401
Then the universe exploded into existence,

801
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:27,612
and the remnants of these systems

802
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:31,198
were forged into concentrated ingots.

803
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:34,243
infinity Stones.

804
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:36,871
These stones, it seems,

805
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:38,873
can only be brandished

806
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,501
by beings of extraordinary strength.

807
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:43,711
Observe.

808
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:52,762
These carriers can use the Stone to mow down entire civilizations

809
00:57:52,845 --> 00:57:56,349
like wheat in a field.

810
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:00,102
There's a little pee coming out of me right now.

811
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:02,146
Once, for a moment,

812
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:06,359
a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves,

813
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:09,487
but even they were quickly destroyed by it.

814
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,370
Beautiful.

815
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:21,624
Beyond compare.

816
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,709
Blah, blah, blah.

817
00:58:23,793 --> 00:58:27,463
We're all very fascinated, whitey. But we'd like to get paid.

818
00:58:29,382 --> 00:58:30,758
How would you like to get paid?

819
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:32,968
What do you think, fancy man? Units!

820
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,513
Very well, then.

821
00:58:41,102 --> 00:58:42,478
Carina.

822
00:58:42,812 --> 00:58:43,813
Stand back.

823
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:47,108
I will no longer be your slave!

824
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:48,734
No!

825
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,116
What the...

826
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:49,378
How could I think Tivan could contain whatever was within the Orb?

827
00:59:49,462 --> 00:59:51,547
What do you still have it for?

828
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:52,965
What are we gonna do, leave it in there?

829
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,967
I can't believe you had that in your purse!

830
00:59:55,676 --> 00:59:56,844
It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

831
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:58,721
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps.

832
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:00,723
There's a chance they can contain it.

833
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:01,807
Are you kidding me?

834
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:04,810
We're wanted by the Nova Corps. Just give it to Ronan!

835
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:06,187
So he can destroy the galaxy?

836
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,147
What are you, some saint all of a sudden?

837
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,275
What has the galaxy ever done for you? Why would you wanna save it?

838
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:13,152
Because I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!

839
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:14,695
Peter, listen to me.

840
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:17,948
We cannot allow the Stone to fall into Ronan's hands.

841
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:19,700
We have to go back to your ship,

842
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:21,368
and deliver it to Nova.

843
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,913
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

844
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:28,626
Or we could give it to somebody who's not going to arrest us,

845
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:30,044
who's really nice

846
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:31,879
for a whole lot of money.

847
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:34,548
I think it's a really good balance between both of your points of view.

848
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:35,716
You're despicable.

849
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:37,384
Dishonourable.

850
01:00:38,052 --> 01:00:39,053
Faithless!

851
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:41,305
- Oh, no. - At last!

852
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:46,352
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

853
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:48,229
You called Ronan?

854
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:56,111
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

855
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:59,406
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

856
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,746
Ronan the Accuser!

857
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,374
You are the one who transmitted the message?

858
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:09,750
You killed my wife.

859
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:12,503
You killed my daughter!

860
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,806
I told you, you can't fit. Now, wait here. I'll be back.

861
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,773
It is Gamora. She is escaping with the Orb.

862
01:01:41,574 --> 01:01:43,200
No!

863
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:44,326
Nebula,

864
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,787
retrieve the Orb.

865
01:02:03,304 --> 01:02:05,222
The Stone is in the furthest pod.

866
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:07,182
Bring it down!

867
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,242
Ah!

868
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:38,923
Rocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano.

869
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,467
How? We've got no weaponry on these things.

870
01:02:41,634 --> 01:02:43,385
These pods are industrial grade.

871
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:44,678
They're nearly indestructible.

872
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:47,056
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

873
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:49,141
That's not what I'm saying.

874
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:51,477
Oh!

875
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:39,316
Let me borrow your ride.

876
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:13,934
I don't recall killing your family.

877
01:04:17,229 --> 01:04:20,607
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

878
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:40,085
Quill, I'm trapped. I can't make it to the Milano.

879
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:41,712
I have to head out.

880
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:46,175
Wait! These things aren't meant to go out there.

881
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:55,100
You are a disappointment, sister.

882
01:04:55,893 --> 01:04:57,811
Of all our siblings,

883
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,147
I hated you least.

884
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:01,857
Nebula, please.

885
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:03,650
If Ronan gets this stone

886
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:05,819
- he'll kill us all. - Not all.

887
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:09,198
You will already be dead.

888
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,755
Ronan, it is done.

889
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:10,801
Quill, come on.

890
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:13,846
Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes,

891
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:16,014
but there's nothing we can do for her.

892
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,683
These pods aren't meant to be out here.

893
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:20,227
In a second, we're gonna be in the same boat.

894
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:30,070
Aw, damn it.

895
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:32,823
Quill?

896
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:34,741
Yondu! Yondu.

897
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:36,160
This is Quill!

898
01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:39,788
- My coordinates are 227K324. - Quill.

899
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:41,206
Quill, what are you doing?

900
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:42,791
Just outside Knowhere.

901
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:45,085
If you're there, come get me.

902
01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:47,296
I'm all yours.

903
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:58,724
Quill, don't be ridiculous.

904
01:07:00,309 --> 01:07:02,436
Get back into your pod!

905
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:05,898
You can't fit two people in there. You're gonna die.

906
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,942
You'll die in seconds!

907
01:07:09,276 --> 01:07:10,444
Quill.

908
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:13,173
Quill?

909
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:16,301
What happened?

910
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:19,513
I saw you out there.

911
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:23,392
I don't know what came over me.

912
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:26,186
But I couldn't let you die.

913
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:31,441
I found something inside of myself.

914
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:34,027
Something

915
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:36,154
incredibly heroic.

916
01:08:37,906 --> 01:08:40,450
I mean, not to brag,

917
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:41,868
but, objectively...

918
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:43,036
Where's the Orb?

919
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:47,124
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

920
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:48,333
What?

921
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,505
Welcome home, Peter.

922
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:19,156
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

923
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,743
Quill just got himself captured.

924
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:27,205
None of this ever would have happened if you didn't try to single-handedly

925
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:28,582
take on a frickin' army!

926
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:31,585
You're right.

927
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:36,381
I was a fool.

928
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:40,552
All the anger,

929
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:43,055
all the rage,

930
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:48,518
was just to cover my loss.

931
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:59,446
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo. "My wife and child are dead."

932
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:03,200
Oh, I don't care if it's mean!

933
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:05,243
Everybody's got dead people.

934
01:10:05,911 --> 01:10:07,579
It's no excuse to get everybody else

935
01:10:07,746 --> 01:10:09,623
dead along the way!

936
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:16,129
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.

937
01:10:16,296 --> 01:10:19,549
The only chance we got is to get to the other side of the universe

938
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:21,510
as fast as we can and maybe,

939
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:26,306
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives before that whack-job ever gets there.

940
01:10:28,809 --> 01:10:30,143
I am Groot.

941
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:32,604
Save them? How?

942
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:35,524
I am Groot.

943
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:38,360
I know they're the only friends that we ever had,

944
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:41,154
but there's an army of Ravagers around them.

945
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:42,948
And there's only two of us!

946
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,242
Three.

947
01:10:51,832 --> 01:10:53,125
Aw!

948
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:56,545
You're making me

949
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:58,296
beat...up

950
01:10:58,463 --> 01:10:59,464
grass!

951
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,718
The Orb is in my possession,

952
01:11:04,845 --> 01:11:06,346
as I promised.

953
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:08,056
Bring it to me.

954
01:11:08,223 --> 01:11:11,518
Yes, that was our agreement.

955
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:13,937
Bring you the Orb,

956
01:11:14,104 --> 01:11:17,649
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

957
01:11:17,816 --> 01:11:22,362
However, now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone,

958
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:24,531
I wonder what use I have for you.

959
01:11:24,698 --> 01:11:26,199
Boy,

960
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:28,952
I would reconsider your current course.

961
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,372
Master! You cannot!

962
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:35,041
Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.

963
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:37,335
Not any more.

964
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,402
You call me "boy!"

965
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:07,115
I will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice on Xandar,

966
01:12:07,282 --> 01:12:10,785
and burn it to its core!

967
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:12,913
Then, Thanos,

968
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:15,040
I am coming for you.

969
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:20,337
After Xandar, you are going to kill my father?

970
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,631
You dare to oppose me?

971
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:24,633
You see what he has turned me into.

972
01:12:24,716 --> 01:12:28,970
If you kill him, I will help you destroy a thousand planets.

973
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:31,264
You betray me?

974
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:33,183
Steal my money?

975
01:12:33,308 --> 01:12:34,935
Stop it! Leave him alone!

976
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:37,395
When I picked you up as a kid,

977
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:39,898
these boys wanted to eat you.

978
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:42,484
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

979
01:12:42,651 --> 01:12:44,361
I saved your life!

980
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:46,613
Oh, will you shut up about that? God!

981
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:49,074
Twenty years, you been throwing that in my face,

982
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:51,868
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

983
01:12:51,952 --> 01:12:55,539
Normal people don't even think about eating someone else!

984
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:58,166
Much less that person having to be grateful for it!

985
01:12:58,333 --> 01:12:59,459
You abducted me, man.

986
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,712
You stole me from my home and from my family.

987
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:05,006
You don't give a damn about your Terra!

988
01:13:05,507 --> 01:13:06,508
You're scared

989
01:13:06,675 --> 01:13:08,802
because you're soft in here.

990
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:09,970
Here, right here!

991
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:11,304
Yondu!

992
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:12,722
Listen to me.

993
01:13:12,806 --> 01:13:15,058
Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone.

994
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:16,977
I know what he's got, girl.

995
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:19,437
Then you know we must get it back!

996
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:22,983
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

997
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:26,194
We have to warn them. Billions of people will perish.

998
01:13:26,278 --> 01:13:28,905
Is that what she's been filling your head with, boy?

999
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:29,990
Sentiment?

1000
01:13:31,491 --> 01:13:33,326
Eating away your brain like maggots!

1001
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:39,499
That's it.

1002
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,209
No!

1003
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:42,752
Sorry, boy.

1004
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:46,423
But a captain's gotta teach his men what happens to those what cross him.

1005
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:47,841
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

1006
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:52,929
If you kill me now,

1007
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:57,183
you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen.

1008
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:03,773
The Stone?

1009
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:06,484
I hope you got something better than that.

1010
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:09,279
Because ain't nobody stealing from Ronan.

1011
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:11,781
We got a ringer.

1012
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:13,366
Is that right?

1013
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:16,870
She knows everything there is to know about Ronan.

1014
01:14:17,037 --> 01:14:18,288
His ships,

1015
01:14:18,455 --> 01:14:19,998
his army.

1016
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:22,000
He's vulnerable.

1017
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,127
Hey, what do you say, Yondu, huh?

1018
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:27,756
Me and you, taking down a mark side-by-side, like the old days.

1019
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:36,556
Let him go!

1020
01:14:38,266 --> 01:14:40,810
You always did have a scrote, boy!

1021
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,688
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

1022
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,948
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

1023
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:56,326
Attention, idiots.

1024
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:02,207
The lunatic on top of this craft is holding a Hadron Enforcer.

1025
01:15:02,374 --> 01:15:04,084
It's a weapon of my own design.

1026
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,377
What the hell?

1027
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:08,505
If you don't hand over our companions now,

1028
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:11,007
he's gonna tear yours hip a new one.

1029
01:15:11,174 --> 01:15:12,926
A very big new one!

1030
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:15,929
- I ain't bu yin' it. - I'm giving you to the count of five.

1031
01:15:16,471 --> 01:15:19,599
- 5, 4, 3... - No! Wait, hold on!

1032
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:21,518
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

1033
01:15:21,685 --> 01:15:23,687
We figured it out! We're fine!

1034
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:25,063
Oh, hey, Quill. What's going on?

1035
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,608
You call that "figured it out"?

1036
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:30,985
We're gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless.

1037
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:32,612
Oh, you want to talk about senseless?

1038
01:15:32,696 --> 01:15:34,989
How about trying to save us by blowing us up?

1039
01:15:35,073 --> 01:15:37,909
We were only gonna blow you up if they didn't turn you over!

1040
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:39,786
And how on earth were they gonna turn us over

1041
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:41,121
when you only gave them a count of five?

1042
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,957
We didn't have time to work out the minutiae

1043
01:15:44,124 --> 01:15:45,125
of the plan.

1044
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:47,502
This is what we get for acting altruistically.

1045
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:49,671
- I am Groot. - They are ungrateful.

1046
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:50,964
What's important now

1047
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:52,757
is we get the Ravagers' army

1048
01:15:52,924 --> 01:15:54,134
to help us save Xandar.

1049
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:55,677
So we can give the Stone to Yondu

1050
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,345
who's just gonna sell to somebody even worse?

1051
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:59,097
We'll figure that part out later.

1052
01:15:59,264 --> 01:16:00,974
We have to stop Ronan.

1053
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,475
How?

1054
01:16:02,642 --> 01:16:03,727
I have a plan.

1055
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:04,811
You've got a plan?

1056
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:06,312
Yes.

1057
01:16:06,855 --> 01:16:07,939
First of all, you're copying me from

1058
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:09,441
- when I said I had a plan. - No, I'm not.

1059
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:12,527
People say that all the time. It's not that unique of a thing to say.

1060
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,237
Secondly, I don't even believe you have a plan.

1061
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:17,323
I have part of a plan!

1062
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,992
What percentage of a plan do you have?

1063
01:16:19,159 --> 01:16:20,577
You don't get to ask questions

1064
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:21,911
after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.

1065
01:16:22,454 --> 01:16:24,080
I just saved Quill.

1066
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:25,165
We've already established

1067
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:26,916
that you destroying the ship that I'm on is not saving me.

1068
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,169
- When did we establish it? - Like three seconds ago!

1069
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:30,837
I wasn't listening. I was thinking of something else.

1070
01:16:32,005 --> 01:16:33,089
She's right. You don't get an opinion.

1071
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:35,008
What percentage?

1072
01:16:35,175 --> 01:16:36,509
I don't know. Twelve percent.

1073
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:37,969
Twelve percent?

1074
01:16:39,971 --> 01:16:41,097
That's a fake laugh.

1075
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:43,016
- It's real! - Totally fake.

1076
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:47,687
That is the most real, authentic, hysterical laugh of my entire life

1077
01:16:47,854 --> 01:16:48,855
because that is not a plan.

1078
01:16:49,022 --> 01:16:50,440
It's barely a concept.

1079
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:51,608
You're taking their side?

1080
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:52,942
I am Groot.

1081
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:54,486
So what, it's better than 11%?

1082
01:16:54,569 --> 01:16:56,070
What the hell does that have to do with anything?

1083
01:16:56,154 --> 01:16:58,364
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

1084
01:16:58,865 --> 01:17:02,327
See? Groot's the only one of you who has a clue.

1085
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:08,374
Guys.

1086
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:10,293
Come on.

1087
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,462
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

1088
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:15,048
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

1089
01:17:16,424 --> 01:17:18,343
I need your help.

1090
01:17:20,053 --> 01:17:22,388
I look around at us.

1091
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:23,932
You know what I see?

1092
01:17:24,891 --> 01:17:25,892
Losers.

1093
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:30,104
I mean, like,

1094
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:32,232
folks who have lost stuff.

1095
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:34,484
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

1096
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:36,903
Our homes,

1097
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:39,030
our families,

1098
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:42,075
normal lives.

1099
01:17:42,242 --> 01:17:44,953
And, usually, life takes more than it gives. But not today.

1100
01:17:45,787 --> 01:17:47,330
Today, it's given us something.

1101
01:17:47,497 --> 01:17:49,040
It has given us a chance.

1102
01:17:49,207 --> 01:17:50,542
To do what?

1103
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:53,753
To give a shit.

1104
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:56,339
For once.

1105
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:58,508
Not run away.

1106
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:03,847
I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch

1107
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:07,016
as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives.

1108
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:10,728
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

1109
01:18:11,813 --> 01:18:13,857
it's impossible.

1110
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:16,651
You're asking us to die.

1111
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:25,201
Yeah, I guess I am.

1112
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:39,173
Quill.

1113
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:46,681
I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies.

1114
01:18:50,727 --> 01:18:54,939
I will be grateful to die among my friends.

1115
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:01,154
You are an honourable man, Quill.

1116
01:19:02,864 --> 01:19:05,074
I will fight beside you.

1117
01:19:06,284 --> 01:19:07,785
And in the end,

1118
01:19:09,746 --> 01:19:11,789
I will see my wife and daughter again.

1119
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:20,924
I am Groot.

1120
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:34,479
Oh, what the hell. I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway.

1121
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:42,737
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

1122
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:45,365
We're all standing up now.

1123
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:48,785
Bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle.

1124
01:19:56,042 --> 01:19:57,543
The Stone reacts to anything organic.

1125
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:59,754
The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge.

1126
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:03,007
All Ronan's got to do is touch the Stone to the planet's surface and zap.

1127
01:20:03,174 --> 01:20:04,801
All plants, animals,

1128
01:20:04,968 --> 01:20:06,427
- Nova Corps. - Everything will die.

1129
01:20:07,095 --> 01:20:09,055
So Ronan does not make the surface.

1130
01:20:12,016 --> 01:20:13,977
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole

1131
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,270
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

1132
01:20:16,437 --> 01:20:20,525
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

1133
01:20:20,608 --> 01:20:23,403
Won't there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?

1134
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:26,322
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

1135
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:33,538
Once they know we're on board,

1136
01:20:33,705 --> 01:20:37,125
Ronan will isolate himself behind impenetrable security doors on deck.

1137
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:39,627
Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.

1138
01:20:39,794 --> 01:20:41,504
We'll make it to the flight deck,

1139
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:44,590
and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.

1140
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:50,221
Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the Stone.

1141
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,849
Use these devices to contain it.

1142
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:54,600
If you touch it,

1143
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:56,686
it will kill you.

1144
01:20:59,522 --> 01:21:01,441
I'll contact one of the Nova officers

1145
01:21:01,524 --> 01:21:02,775
who arrested us.

1146
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:04,485
Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help.

1147
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:09,240
There's one more thing we need to complete the plan.

1148
01:21:09,991 --> 01:21:11,200
That guy's eye.

1149
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:14,620
No! No, we don't. No, we don't need

1150
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:16,122
that guy's eye.

1151
01:21:17,248 --> 01:21:19,834
No, seriously, I need it! It's important to me.

1152
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:26,215
Ronan's fleet has been spotted,

1153
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:27,383
and will arrive in T-minus

1154
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:29,177
fifteen minutes.

1155
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:31,054
Remember, boy.

1156
01:21:31,471 --> 01:21:33,347
At the end of all this,

1157
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:34,807
I get the Stone.

1158
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:37,393
You cross me, we kill you all.

1159
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:01,375
Let's go get 'em, boys!

1160
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:12,136
This is a terrible plan.

1161
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:14,388
Hey, you're the one who said you wanted to die among friends.

1162
01:22:19,477 --> 01:22:20,478
Nova Prime.

1163
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:23,231
I received a transmission

1164
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:24,649
from one of the Ravagers.

1165
01:22:25,191 --> 01:22:27,777
He says Ronan's in possession of something called an Infinity Stone

1166
01:22:27,944 --> 01:22:29,320
and he's headed toward Xandar.

1167
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:30,613
Good God.

1168
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,698
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

1169
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:35,326
Did he say why we should believe him?

1170
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:37,578
He said his crew just escaped from prison

1171
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:40,706
so he'd have no other reason to risk coming to Xandar to help.

1172
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:42,708
He says that he's an

1173
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:44,794
"a-hole."

1174
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:46,379
But he's not,

1175
01:22:46,546 --> 01:22:48,297
and I'm quoting him, here,

1176
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:50,591
"100% a dick."

1177
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:52,051
Do you believe him?

1178
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:55,805
I don't know that I believe anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am.

1179
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:58,808
I mean, do you believe that he is here to help?

1180
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,521
Yeah.

1181
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:15,074
A fleet approaches.

1182
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:17,118
They appear to be Ravagers.

1183
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:29,297
Fire!

1184
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:41,809
Cover it down.

1185
01:23:41,976 --> 01:23:43,895
Submerge!

1186
01:23:56,824 --> 01:23:58,034
Rocket, hurry!

1187
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,750
All pilots, dive!

1188
01:24:05,917 --> 01:24:07,084
They're beneath us!

1189
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:17,303
Evacuate the city.

1190
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:20,973
Our priority is to get our people away from the battle.

1191
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:28,981
Forward thrust, now!

1192
01:24:42,536 --> 01:24:43,537
Come on!

1193
01:24:45,248 --> 01:24:46,832
Quill! Yondu! Now!

1194
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:10,648
Aw, hell!

1195
01:25:10,815 --> 01:25:12,233
I'm going down, Quill!

1196
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,151
No more games with me, boy!

1197
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:15,361
I'll see you

1198
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:17,238
at the end of this!

1199
01:25:23,536 --> 01:25:24,954
There are too many of them, Rocket!

1200
01:25:25,705 --> 01:25:27,456
We'll never make it up there!

1201
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:43,597
Peter Quill.

1202
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:46,142
This is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps.

1203
01:25:46,309 --> 01:25:49,603
For the record, I advised against trusting you here.

1204
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:51,105
They got my "dick" message!

1205
01:25:51,564 --> 01:25:52,732
Prove me wrong.

1206
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:02,074
Yes!

1207
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:24,347
Yes!

1208
01:26:27,767 --> 01:26:29,560
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

1209
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:35,191
The starboard kern has been breached!

1210
01:26:35,358 --> 01:26:36,692
We have been boarded.

1211
01:26:36,776 --> 01:26:38,152
Continue our approach.

1212
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:39,612
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

1213
01:26:39,779 --> 01:26:42,406
None of that will matter once we reach the surface.

1214
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:43,532
Seal security doors!

1215
01:26:43,741 --> 01:26:44,784
Now!

1216
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:48,788
Get out of my way!

1217
01:27:00,049 --> 01:27:01,550
Oh, man.

1218
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:06,097
All Nova pilots, interlock and form a blockade.

1219
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:10,101
The Dark Aster must not reach the ground.

1220
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:23,823
Locked in!

1221
01:27:24,657 --> 01:27:25,825
Locked in.

1222
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:28,411
We're locked in.

1223
01:28:06,699 --> 01:28:08,868
I can barely see.

1224
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:36,979
When did you learn to do that?

1225
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:38,606
Pretty sure the answer is

1226
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:40,357
"I am Groot."

1227
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:44,028
The flight deck is 300 metres this way.

1228
01:28:47,281 --> 01:28:50,659
I want you all to know that I am grateful for your acceptance after my blunders.

1229
01:28:51,202 --> 01:28:53,412
It is pleasing to once again have

1230
01:28:54,038 --> 01:28:55,039
friends.

1231
01:28:56,123 --> 01:28:59,001
You, Quill, are my friend.

1232
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:00,294
Thanks.

1233
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:03,214
- This dumb tree, he is my friend. - Mmm.

1234
01:29:04,715 --> 01:29:05,925
And this green whore, she, too...

1235
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:07,551
Oh, you must stop!

1236
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:13,182
Gamora, look at what you have done.

1237
01:29:13,933 --> 01:29:15,893
You have always been weak.

1238
01:29:16,143 --> 01:29:18,270
You stupid, traitorous...

1239
01:29:23,442 --> 01:29:25,778
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

1240
01:29:26,904 --> 01:29:27,988
Head to the flight deck.

1241
01:29:28,155 --> 01:29:30,783
I'll shut down the power to the security doors.

1242
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:40,584
Yondu Udonta.

1243
01:29:40,751 --> 01:29:44,255
Order your men to turn on the Nova Corps.

1244
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:02,565
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

1245
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:04,525
Time to die...

1246
01:30:37,224 --> 01:30:38,267
Nebula, please.

1247
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:55,534
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

1248
01:30:55,701 --> 01:30:57,745
enact immolation initiative.

1249
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:02,791
They're dive-bombing the city!

1250
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:04,668
Denarian Saal, should we break formation?

1251
01:31:04,835 --> 01:31:06,462
No! Hold your positions.

1252
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:39,536
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

1253
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:41,330
We'll take care of the people down here.

1254
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:43,582
I can't believe I'm taking orders from a hamster.

1255
01:31:46,794 --> 01:31:48,045
Star-Lord.

1256
01:31:48,504 --> 01:31:49,505
Finally.

1257
01:31:55,094 --> 01:31:56,261
Ah!

1258
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:01,475
You thief!

1259
01:32:13,362 --> 01:32:16,198
You will never make it to Ronan.

1260
01:32:21,954 --> 01:32:24,206
Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground.

1261
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,216
Come on!

1262
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:20,512
Finger to the throat means death.

1263
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:27,770
Metaphor.

1264
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,188
Yeah, sorta.

1265
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:30,522
Oh, no.

1266
01:33:58,509 --> 01:33:59,927
Xandar!

1267
01:34:00,594 --> 01:34:03,222
You stand accused.

1268
01:34:04,056 --> 01:34:07,059
Your wretched peace treaty will not

1269
01:34:07,226 --> 01:34:08,393
save you now.

1270
01:34:08,894 --> 01:34:12,147
It is the tinder on which you burn.

1271
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:37,756
Rocket!

1272
01:34:37,923 --> 01:34:39,716
Hold on, Saal, just...

1273
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:07,661
Quill, you gotta hurry.

1274
01:35:07,828 --> 01:35:09,496
The city's been evacuated,

1275
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:12,165
but we're getting our asses kicked down here.

1276
01:35:12,249 --> 01:35:13,667
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

1277
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,401
Nebula!

1278
01:35:40,986 --> 01:35:43,488
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

1279
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:45,157
You know he's crazy.

1280
01:35:45,616 --> 01:35:47,659
I know you're both crazy.

1281
01:35:47,826 --> 01:35:48,994
No!

1282
01:35:51,872 --> 01:35:52,873
- What the...? - Ah!

1283
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:55,667
Get out!

1284
01:36:37,084 --> 01:36:38,085
You did it!

1285
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:05,904
I was mistaken.

1286
01:37:05,988 --> 01:37:07,572
I do remember your family.

1287
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,950
Their screams were

1288
01:37:10,117 --> 01:37:12,244
pitiful. I...

1289
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:10,487
No, Groot!

1290
01:39:11,071 --> 01:39:12,197
You can't.

1291
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,740
You'll die.

1292
01:39:14,324 --> 01:39:16,159
Why are you doing this?

1293
01:39:16,326 --> 01:39:17,786
Why?

1294
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:25,961
We

1295
01:39:26,378 --> 01:39:27,420
are

1296
01:39:28,046 --> 01:39:29,548
Groot.

1297
01:40:33,945 --> 01:40:35,989
I called him an idiot.

1298
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,639
You killed Groot!

1299
01:41:04,809 --> 01:41:06,102
Behold!

1300
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:10,482
Your guardians of the galaxy.

1301
01:41:10,565 --> 01:41:13,026
What fruit have they wrought?

1302
01:41:13,109 --> 01:41:17,239
Only that my father and his father

1303
01:41:17,322 --> 01:41:20,867
shall finally know vengeance.

1304
01:41:21,034 --> 01:41:23,286
People of Xandar,

1305
01:41:23,912 --> 01:41:25,664
the time has come

1306
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:28,625
to rejoice and renounce

1307
01:41:28,792 --> 01:41:31,002
your paltry gods!

1308
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:35,173
Your salvation is at hand.

1309
01:41:47,936 --> 01:41:49,437
Listen to these words.

1310
01:41:58,530 --> 01:42:00,198
Now bring it down hard!

1311
01:42:03,618 --> 01:42:04,661
What are you doing?

1312
01:42:05,203 --> 01:42:07,747
Dance-off, bro. Me and you.

1313
01:42:11,209 --> 01:42:12,585
Gamora.

1314
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:15,672
Subtle. Take it back.

1315
01:42:16,131 --> 01:42:18,341
What are you doing?

1316
01:42:18,675 --> 01:42:21,011
I'm distracting you, you big turd blossom.

1317
01:42:37,235 --> 01:42:38,737
No!

1318
01:43:12,729 --> 01:43:15,857
Peter! Take my hand!

1319
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:23,281
Take my hand, Peter.

1320
01:43:24,199 --> 01:43:25,617
Mom.

1321
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:28,161
Take my hand!

1322
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:24,551
You're mortal!

1323
01:44:24,717 --> 01:44:26,010
How?

1324
01:44:26,177 --> 01:44:28,388
You said it yourself, bitch.

1325
01:44:28,471 --> 01:44:30,849
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1326
01:45:00,712 --> 01:45:01,921
Well, well, well.

1327
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:03,548
Quite the light show.

1328
01:45:05,842 --> 01:45:07,510
Ain't this sweet.

1329
01:45:09,053 --> 01:45:11,556
But you got some business to attend to

1330
01:45:11,723 --> 01:45:14,142
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

1331
01:45:15,852 --> 01:45:18,021
Peter, you can't. Peter.

1332
01:45:18,188 --> 01:45:20,231
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.

1333
01:45:20,732 --> 01:45:22,317
I don't know who you're selling this to,

1334
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,319
but the only way the universe can survive

1335
01:45:24,486 --> 01:45:26,154
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

1336
01:45:26,988 --> 01:45:29,157
I may be as pretty as an angel,

1337
01:45:31,409 --> 01:45:33,286
but I sure as hell ain't one.

1338
01:45:34,996 --> 01:45:36,498
Hand it over, son.

1339
01:45:53,348 --> 01:45:54,349
Yondu.

1340
01:45:57,435 --> 01:46:00,730
Do not open that Orb. You know that, right?

1341
01:46:01,356 --> 01:46:03,816
You've seen what it does to people.

1342
01:46:14,577 --> 01:46:16,788
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

1343
01:46:17,664 --> 01:46:20,291
It's probably good we didn't deliver him to his dad

1344
01:46:20,416 --> 01:46:21,417
like we was hired to do.

1345
01:46:21,501 --> 01:46:24,254
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

1346
01:46:29,133 --> 01:46:32,679
He is gonna be so pissed when he realises I switched out the Orb on him.

1347
01:46:35,431 --> 01:46:37,267
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

1348
01:46:38,476 --> 01:46:40,144
Oh, I know.

1349
01:46:42,021 --> 01:46:43,648
But he was about the only family I had.

1350
01:46:46,568 --> 01:46:47,610
No.

1351
01:46:48,861 --> 01:46:50,071
He wasn't.

1352
01:47:38,328 --> 01:47:39,621
Why would you even know this?

1353
01:47:39,996 --> 01:47:42,749
When we arrested you, we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system,

1354
01:47:42,832 --> 01:47:44,208
so we had it checked out.

1355
01:47:45,543 --> 01:47:47,170
I'm not Terran?

1356
01:47:47,337 --> 01:47:48,838
You are half Terran.

1357
01:47:49,005 --> 01:47:52,634
Your mother was of Earth. Your father, well,

1358
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:56,346
he's something very ancient we've never seen here before.

1359
01:47:56,679 --> 01:47:57,847
That could be why you were able

1360
01:47:58,014 --> 01:48:00,224
to hold the Stone for as long as you did.

1361
01:48:00,725 --> 01:48:02,143
Your friends have arrived.

1362
01:48:04,062 --> 01:48:06,314
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

1363
01:48:06,731 --> 01:48:09,317
we'd like to express our profound gratitude

1364
01:48:10,151 --> 01:48:11,861
for your help in saving Xandar.

1365
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:16,407
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

1366
01:48:16,574 --> 01:48:18,159
he has something to show you.

1367
01:48:18,326 --> 01:48:20,078
Thank you, Nova Prime.

1368
01:48:28,670 --> 01:48:33,174
Your wife and child shall rest well knowing that you have avenged them.

1369
01:48:33,675 --> 01:48:34,842
Yes.

1370
01:48:35,009 --> 01:48:36,928
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

1371
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:39,847
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

1372
01:48:42,517 --> 01:48:45,269
We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible.

1373
01:48:45,895 --> 01:48:47,855
We salvaged as much as we could.

1374
01:48:49,148 --> 01:48:50,274
Wow.

1375
01:48:50,942 --> 01:48:51,943
I...

1376
01:48:53,945 --> 01:48:55,071
Thank you.

1377
01:48:56,614 --> 01:48:58,282
I have a family.

1378
01:48:58,783 --> 01:49:00,284
They're alive because of you.

1379
01:49:04,956 --> 01:49:07,333
Your criminal records have also been expunged.

1380
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:11,462
However, I have to warn you against breaking any laws in the future.

1381
01:49:12,088 --> 01:49:13,089
Question.

1382
01:49:13,256 --> 01:49:14,382
What if I see something that I want to take,

1383
01:49:14,465 --> 01:49:15,800
and it belongs to someone else?

1384
01:49:15,883 --> 01:49:17,176
You will be arrested.

1385
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:19,470
But what if I want it more than the person who has it?

1386
01:49:19,971 --> 01:49:21,973
- It's still illegal. - That doesn't follow.

1387
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:23,141
No, I want it more, sir. Do you understand?

1388
01:49:23,725 --> 01:49:24,934
What are you laughing at?

1389
01:49:25,101 --> 01:49:26,561
Why? I can't have a discussion with this gentleman?

1390
01:49:26,644 --> 01:49:28,479
What if someone does something irksome

1391
01:49:28,646 --> 01:49:30,815
and I decide to remove his spine?

1392
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,484
That's...

1393
01:49:34,610 --> 01:49:36,821
That's actually murder.

1394
01:49:38,614 --> 01:49:41,159
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1395
01:49:41,325 --> 01:49:44,162
So...also illegal.

1396
01:49:44,954 --> 01:49:45,997
Hmm.

1397
01:49:47,749 --> 01:49:48,791
They'll be fine, Dey.

1398
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:50,668
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

1399
01:49:50,835 --> 01:49:51,836
You?

1400
01:49:55,298 --> 01:49:58,259
Yeah. Me.

1401
01:50:17,236 --> 01:50:18,780
Peter,

1402
01:50:19,363 --> 01:50:22,700
I know these last few months have been hard for you.

1403
01:50:23,993 --> 01:50:26,579
But I'm going to a better place.

1404
01:50:26,746 --> 01:50:29,207
And I will be okay.

1405
01:50:29,373 --> 01:50:33,085
And I will always be with you.

1406
01:50:34,796 --> 01:50:37,465
You are the light of my life.

1407
01:50:37,632 --> 01:50:39,884
My precious son.

1408
01:50:40,843 --> 01:50:43,763
My little Star-Lord.

1409
01:50:44,514 --> 01:50:46,474
Love, Mom.

1410
01:52:47,053 --> 01:52:48,679
So, what should we do next?

1411
01:52:49,013 --> 01:52:50,014
Something good?

1412
01:52:51,057 --> 01:52:52,141
Something bad?

1413
01:52:52,683 --> 01:52:54,310
A bit of both?

1414
01:52:55,937 --> 01:52:58,856
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.

1415
01:53:01,108 --> 01:53:02,151
Bit of both.

1416
02:00:26,470 --> 02:00:28,806
What do you let it lick you like that for?

1417
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:31,683
Gross.

1418
02:00:34,728 --> 02:00:36,188
Yeah!

1419
02:00:36,313 --> 02:00:38,107
But it burns going down.
