1
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,967
<font color="#ffff54">I sense you, brother.</font>

2
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,250
<font color="#ffff54">Hiding...</font>

3
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,333
<font color="#ffff54">...behind your cloak.</font>

4
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,083
<font color="#ffff54">It is time to earn yours.</font>

5
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,791
<font color="#ffff54">Still too small to take me head on.</font>

6
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,041
<font color="#ffff54">Use the cave!</font>

7
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,125
<font color="#ffff54">You fight with rage.</font>

8
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,333
<font color="#ffff54">I fight like father.</font>

9
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,791
<font color="#ffff54">You are not father, you are Dek!</font>

10
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,791
<font color="#ffff54">Do you yield?</font>

11
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,083
<font color="#ffff54">Never!</font>

12
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,125
<font color="#ffff54">Good.</font>

13
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,625
<font color="#ffff54">I'm still alive, brother.</font>

14
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,041
<font color="#ffff54">Still much to prove...</font>

15
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,625
<font color="#ffff54">...to show who you are.</font>

16
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,583
<font color="#ffff54">I am Yautja.</font>

17
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,208
<font color="#ffff54">Not yet.</font>

18
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,791
<font color="#ffff54">Are you holding your sword, Kwei?</font>

19
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,666
<font color="#ffff54">No.</font>

20
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,041
<font color="#ffff54">Pick it up!</font>

21
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,000
<font color="#ffff54">You kept this toy?!</font>

22
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,333
<font color="#ffff54">You remember what happened...</font>

23
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,208
<font color="#ffff54">I lost my fang!</font>

24
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,666
<font color="#ffff54">And you saved my life.</font>

25
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,000
<font color="#ffff54">You protected me.</font>

26
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,958
<font color="#ffff54">Come here.</font>

27
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,125
<font color="#ffff54">Fixed it for you.</font>

28
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,708
<font color="#ffff54">Don't blow yourself up.</font>

29
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,583
<font color="#ffff54">Today you make a vow...</font>

30
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:59,252
<font color="#ffff54">...as our ancestors did before you.</font>

31
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,000
<font color="#ffff54">To earn your place in the clan...</font>

32
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,625
<font color="#ffff54">...you must choose your prey.</font>

33
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,125
<font color="#ffff54">Bring it home...</font>

34
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,000
<font color="#ffff54">...or never return.</font>

35
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,416
<font color="#ffff54">Wait - Go back!</font>

36
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,166
<font color="#ffff54">Genna.</font>

37
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,666
<font color="#ffff54">The death planet.</font>

38
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:35,541
<font color="#ffff54">Home of the un-killable Kalisk.</font>

39
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,929
Even father fears it.
<font color="#ffff54">Even father fears it.</font>

40
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,333
<font color="#ffff54">Then the Kalisk shall be my trophy.</font>

41
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,458
<font color="#ffff54">Father calls me the weakest...</font>

42
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,750
<font color="#ffff54">...so I must kill the strongest.</font>

43
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,250
<font color="#ffff54">Failure means death.</font>

44
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:02,000
<font color="#ffff54">Then I will not fail.</font>

45
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,791
<font color="#ffff54">I cannot allow it.</font>

46
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,416
<font color="#ffff54">I make my vow.</font>

47
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,541
<font color="#ffff54">I make my vow!</font>

48
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:12,953
<font color="#ffff54">Father.</font>

49
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,875
<font color="#ffff54">I welcome you with honor.</font>

50
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,875
<font color="#ffff54">Why is it not done?</font>

51
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,291
<font color="#ffff54">He deserves a hunt.</font>

52
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,083
<font color="#ffff54">He is our clan's weakness...</font>

53
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,791
<font color="#ffff54">...weakness must be culled.</font>

54
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,791
<font color="#ffff54">He will bring home the Kalisk.</font>

55
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,375
<font color="#ffff54">Foolishness.</font>

56
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,500
<font color="#ffff54">He is a runt.</font>

57
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,875
<font color="#ffff54">You should have done it as he slept.</font>

58
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,666
<font color="#ffff54">Kill him!</font>

59
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,375
<font color="#ffff54">Now!</font>

60
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,708
<font color="#ffff54">He will only honor us in death.</font>

61
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,750
<font color="#ffff54">Father.</font>

62
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,666
<font color="#ffff54">Kwei?</font>

63
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,958
<font color="#ffff54">Be brave, brother.</font>

64
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,041
<font color="#ffff54">Father!</font>

65
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,625
<font color="#ffff54">Kwei!!!</font>

66
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:08,041
<font color="#ffff54">To forgive weakness...</font>

67
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,916
<font color="#ffff54">...is to show weakness.</font>

68
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,708
<font color="#ffff54">No! Father, no!</font>

69
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,500
<font color="#ffff54">Get your sword!</font>

70
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,791
<font color="#ffff54">Kwei!!!</font>

71
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,933
COMPUTER, IN YAUTJA:
<font color="#ffff54">Launch sequence initiated.</font>

72
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,541
<font color="#ffff54">Bring it home.</font>

73
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,833
<font color="#ffff54">Bring it home.</font>

74
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,375
<font color="#ffff54">For Kwei.</font>

75
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:45,938
Yautja!

76
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,677
Yautja!

77
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,859
Is this-- Is this-- Is this--

78
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,027
Is this better?

79
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,498
Universal translation.

80
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:14,133
You hear Yautja,
others hear their language...

81
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,704
Oh, boy.

82
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:20,172
This isn't great for you.

83
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,262
It waits
for the needles to paralyze you.

84
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,033
Then eats you
while you can't move.

85
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:58,511
I could help you, but...
I need a hand.

86
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,620
<font color="#ffff54">Yautja hunt alone.</font>

87
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,758
Yautja might hunt alone,
but they die alone too.

88
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:17,229
Kalisk.

89
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:22,569
You're hunting the Kalisk.

90
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:36,248
Gotta run faster.

91
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,191
It happens fast, huh?

92
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,929
If you had a weapon,
you know, I could use it.

93
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,168
Throw me that,
and I can get you the antidote.

94
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:00,106
Now or never.

95
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39,812
Hi.

96
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,270
Should be good as new.

97
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,110
The venom makes them bloom.

98
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,479
Also makes them
a handy antidote.

99
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,688
How about a lift?

100
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:26,759
Let's go.

101
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:32,231
Excuse you, sir.

102
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:35,375
<font color="#ffff54">What happened to your legs?</font>

103
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:37,469
I'm synthetic.
I was built and deployed

104
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,306
by the Weyland-Yutani
Corporation for research.

105
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:42,942
Because their humans wouldn't
last a day on this planet.

106
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,176
We found that--

107
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,885
Look...

108
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:56,155
Many Yautja have come
for the great Kalisk,

109
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,625
and none have survived it...

110
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,126
or Genna.

111
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:05,164
I've seen the Kalisk.

112
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:07,299
I survived it.

113
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:11,203
You take me along with you,

114
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,806
and I'll guide you to its den.

115
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,275
Once there, I get my legs,

116
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,010
you get your trophy,

117
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,247
and everyone's a winner. Deal?

118
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,000
<font color="#ffff54">You have seen the Kalisk?</font>

119
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:31,123
Oh, yeah. I've seen the Kalisk.

120
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:44,336
Okay. Hmm.

121
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,575
Good luck with your journey.

122
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:54,814
I'm just gonna...
go on my journey.

123
00:26:56,883 --> 00:26:58,918
I'm sure
you'll figure something out.

124
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:08,494
Hey.

125
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:12,832
I've already shown you
that I can be useful to you.

126
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,250
<font color="#ffff54">Useful...</font>

127
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,958
<font color="#ffff54">like tool?</font>

128
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:22,742
Yes. Yes, exactly, like a tool.

129
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:25,344
The only way to survive Genna
is to work with it,

130
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,179
and I know how.

131
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,416
And with the right tool...

132
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:33,720
...you could get the Kalisk.

133
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,888
You could be the first.

134
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,583
<font color="#ffff54">I will use you, tool.</font>

135
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:43,629
You may call me Thi-- Whoa!

136
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:48,868
You seem smaller than the other
Yautja. How old are you?

137
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,738
And what does the chewing?

138
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:54,306
Your outside fangs
or your inside teeth?

139
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:58,577
Oh. What should I call you?

140
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,418
Whoa!

141
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,321
I've never been thrown before.
What a... ...thrill!

142
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,657
How fast were you going
when your ship crashed?

143
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:15,094
Faster than sub-light speed?
We haven't cracked that yet.

144
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,463
Also, that plasma sword
is interesting.

145
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:18,965
Is it unique to your clan?

146
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:20,366
And what may I call you?

147
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:24,303
I call these imbre anguis.

148
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:37,850
They just want a snack.

149
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:48,294
You catch more flies with honey
than you do with vinegar.

150
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,583
<font color="#ffff54">Don't want flies.</font>

151
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:55,868
Predatory organisms are
my specific area of expertise.

152
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:59,305
I've studied Yautja extensively.
It's an impressive culture.

153
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,909
Here, ask me anything.
I bet I have the answer.

154
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:04,443
Oh!

155
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:07,246
Very funny.

156
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,081
And you still haven't
told me your name.

157
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,375
<font color="#ffff54">Name is Dek.</font>

158
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,166
<font color="#ffff54">Now talk that way.</font>

159
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:37,043
Okay, sure.

160
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:41,814
Well, let's back up
and start at the beginning.

161
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:45,251
Genna was formed
64 billion cycles ago,

162
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:48,287
when a dying red dwarf star
in a neighboring system...

163
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:03,102
It's so beautiful.

164
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:06,238
After all the time
I've been stuck here,

165
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:08,407
I never get tired of the view.

166
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:12,166
<font color="#ffff54">How long have you been here?</font>

167
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:15,781
Well, we arrived on Genna two
years ago, and we built a base.

168
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:18,384
Then, I was in
the vulture's nest

169
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,219
for the most exciting

170
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,455
13 days, seven hours, 43 minutes

171
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,424
and two seconds of my life.

172
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:29,061
But I always knew
someone would come.

173
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:32,398
I was just wrong about who.

174
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,750
<font color="#ffff54">Who would come?</font>

175
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:40,372
Tessa.

176
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:45,411
Our crew is made up
entirely of synths.

177
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,379
But Tessa and I are special.

178
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,382
We have a higher sensitivity
than the others.

179
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:53,583
<font color="#ffff54">Sensitivity is weakness.</font>

180
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:58,424
Sensitivity is what allows us
to understand

181
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,426
the creatures on this planet.

182
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:06,332
We were created
to work in tandem.

183
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:11,137
Me, cooped up in the lab,
Tessa out in the field.

184
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:14,573
Until the wonderful day
Tessa let me come with her.

185
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,909
We were exploring Genna.

186
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:21,413
And then the Kalisk attacked us.

187
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:25,985
Separated me... and us.

188
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:31,623
The last sound
I remember hearing

189
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,094
was Tessa calling out my name.

190
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,429
Reaching for me.

191
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,033
Then the Kalisk.

192
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,936
I didn't know what to do.

193
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:57,783
But I refuse
to believe she's dead.

194
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,487
Thia, Thia, Thia, Thia.

195
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,957
Thia, Thia, Thia...

196
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:41,994
Tessa!

197
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,831
Thia, Thia, Thia, Thia.

198
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,333
Thia, Thia.

199
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:28,874
Hello, Tessa.

200
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:31,643
The Company is not pleased.

201
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:36,848
Continued failure will result
in your decommission.

202
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:42,221
Where's Thia?

203
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,493
The Yautja has Thia.

204
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:00,872
<font color="#ffff54">I must eat.</font>

205
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:04,009
Two warriors.
Dek and Thia, on the hunt.

206
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,078
Oh.

207
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:07,846
Quick question.

208
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:09,248
What should I be doing?

209
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:15,500
<font color="#ffff54">What is this creature?</font>

210
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,458
Bone bison.
They're Kalisk food.

211
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:24,763
<font color="#ffff54">Then it will be my food, too.</font>

212
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:28,234
So exciting.
Hunting with a Yautja.

213
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:29,368
Tessa wouldn't believe it.

214
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:33,205
Just a warning...

215
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:34,958
<font color="#ffff54">Quiet tool!</font>

216
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:39,378
Razor grass.

217
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,851
It'll cut you to ribbons.
We'll just go around.

218
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,041
<font color="#ffff54">You give up too easily.</font>

219
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,329
We might not be alone
in this hunt.

220
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,007
What an odd critter.

221
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,143
I've never seen you before.

222
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,617
Thia. Nice to meet you.

223
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,501
Looks like your competition
is better--

224
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,954
Careful up in these trees.
There are Luna bugs!

225
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,510
Coming up behind you!

226
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,592
Stronger than it looks!

227
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:46,472
Uh, Dek?

228
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:49,074
Dek! Look!

229
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:34,420
<font color="#ffff54">Kalisk?</font>

230
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,787
Not a Kalisk.

231
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,091
This is a Luna bug!

232
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,501
Have any other weapons?

233
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:48,494
Why'd you stop?
Let's get out of here.

234
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:50,916
<font color="#ffff54">You give up too easily.</font>

235
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,509
That was the best hunt
I've ever been on.

236
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:45,043
This is the dream team
right here.

237
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,546
The Dynamic Three.
The Dynamic Trio.

238
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:49,380
The Dynamic Tree-oh!

239
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:51,583
Tree-oh! Remember when
we went down the tree?

240
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:53,284
That monster's mouth,
I mean...

241
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,588
Didn't smell great,
didn't smell great. But...

242
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,759
We got him. We got him.
And then we met you,

243
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:03,495
our little sweet,
little, little thing.

244
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:05,997
Thank you, seriously,
for that experience.

245
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,700
Truly amazing. Thrilling.

246
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,236
Truly thrilling.
What was your favorite part?

247
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:18,009
<font color="#ffff54">When I pierced its head with my sword,</font>

248
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,208
<font color="#ffff54">and its blood rushed down my face.</font>

249
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:25,551
Cool.

250
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:38,063
Oh. No, thanks. I don't eat,
but that's very sweet.

251
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,333
<font color="#ffff54">This flesh is not sweet.</font>

252
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,670
Good to know.

253
00:41:49,775 --> 00:41:51,743
Our little bud here
looks hungry.

254
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,424
I think she's marking you.

255
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:08,994
She wants you
to be a part of her clan.

256
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:11,963
Maybe she's lost.

257
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,416
<font color="#ffff54">I have no clan!</font>

258
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:18,169
What do you mean?
Don't all Yautja have family?

259
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:20,416
<font color="#ffff54">No clan.</font>

260
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,375
So you never had anyone
looking out for you?

261
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:29,708
<font color="#ffff54">I had a brother.</font>

262
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,182
Had?

263
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,754
What happened to him?

264
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,291
<font color="#ffff54">Father killed him.</font>

265
00:42:44,129 --> 00:42:45,563
You're grieving.

266
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:49,791
<font color="#ffff54">Grief is weakness.</font>

267
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:55,373
You're here
because you lost your brother.

268
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:59,625
<font color="#ffff54">I am here for Kalisk.</font>

269
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,500
<font color="#ffff54">Why are you here?</font>

270
00:43:08,353 --> 00:43:10,055
I'm here
because traveling with you

271
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:12,490
is the best way
to get back to Tessa.

272
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,027
When I was
in that vulture's nest,

273
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:18,797
I was so afraid
I would never see her again.

274
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:22,666
<font color="#ffff54">You should be able to survive on your own.</font>

275
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:26,004
I can survive on my own.

276
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,875
But who would want
to survive on their own?

277
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:37,958
<font color="#ffff54">Tessa is your sister.</font>

278
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:43,288
Sister.

279
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:47,325
Yeah.

280
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,795
I guess she is.

281
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:54,866
I have... a sister.

282
00:43:57,602 --> 00:43:59,637
What a lovely thought.

283
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:06,044
I need to find her.

284
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:09,833
<font color="#ffff54">And legs.</font>

285
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,083
Excuse me?

286
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:14,791
<font color="#ffff54">Find your sister.</font>

287
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:17,708
<font color="#ffff54">And legs.</font>

288
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:21,559
Was that a joke?

289
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:41,726
<font color="#ffff54">The sun rises.</font>

290
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:43,791
<font color="#ffff54">Let's go.</font>

291
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:45,496
We can't leave Bud.

292
00:47:46,131 --> 00:47:47,432
Bud?

293
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:50,635
Yeah, Bud. I named her.

294
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:53,500
<font color="#ffff54">Yautja hunt alone.</font>

295
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:57,342
You're not alone, I'm with you.

296
00:47:57,842 --> 00:47:58,709
<font color="#ffff54">You're a tool.</font>

297
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,886
The tree would have eaten us
without her.

298
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:14,375
<font color="#ffff54">We're not in the tree now.</font>

299
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:11,875
<font color="#ffff54">Kalisk?</font>

300
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:19,208
<font color="#ffff54">It drinks here.</font>

301
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,750
<font color="#ffff54">It drinks here?</font>

302
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:30,958
<font color="#ffff54">You are a useless tool if you don't speak.</font>

303
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,575
Bud saved us.

304
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:42,147
She spit on you to claim you
as part of her family.

305
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:50,121
Why'd your father
kill your brother?

306
00:49:57,541 --> 00:50:00,416
<font color="#ffff54">My brother was protecting me.</font>

307
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:09,000
<font color="#ffff54">The clan can have no weakness.</font>

308
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:12,750
<font color="#ffff54">I will show them strength.</font>

309
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:20,118
On Earth...

310
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:23,821
there's a predator known
as the wolf.

311
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:25,556
It's a powerful creature.

312
00:50:28,426 --> 00:50:29,927
They hunt in packs.

313
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:31,929
They're very loyal.

314
00:50:32,897 --> 00:50:35,633
The leader of the pack
is the alpha.

315
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:37,668
Known as the most dominant.

316
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:39,657
<font color="#ffff54">Wolf.</font>

317
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:42,877
<font color="#ffff54">This alpha must be a great killer.</font>

318
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:45,199
<font color="#ffff54">I will hunt it too.</font>

319
00:50:45,283 --> 00:50:46,126
No.

320
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:50,981
The alpha isn't the wolf
who kills the most.

321
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:56,987
The alpha is actually the one
who best protects the pack.

322
00:50:58,916 --> 00:51:00,583
<font color="#ffff54">I see...</font>

323
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:07,125
<font color="#ffff54">But I will be the alpha
that kills the most.</font>

324
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:43,458
<font color="#ffff54">The Kalisk's den?</font>

325
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:13,708
<font color="#ffff54">Who are they?</font>

326
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:17,134
Weyland-Yutani synths.

327
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:22,106
The Kalisk destroyed
most of our mission team.

328
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,813
There I am.

329
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:13,916
<font color="#ffff54">Easier to walk now.</font>

330
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:15,826
It's about to be.

331
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:17,728
No.
<font color="#ffff54">No.</font>

332
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:20,666
<font color="#ffff54">Easier for me to walk now.</font>

333
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:25,803
Oh. Of course. Right.

334
00:53:28,473 --> 00:53:29,874
Thank you, Dek.

335
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,412
I'm never gonna forget this.

336
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,375
<font color="#ffff54">I too will remember this...</font>

337
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:43,583
<font color="#ffff54">today I become Dek of the Yautja.</font>

338
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:47,166
<font color="#ffff54">I will honor Kwei...</font>

339
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:52,041
<font color="#ffff54">when I bring the Kalisk home.</font>

340
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:57,375
<font color="#ffff54">Then I taste revenge.</font>

341
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:02,333
<font color="#ffff54">You will be the first to see my trophy.</font>

342
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:06,125
<font color="#ffff54">It is a great honor.</font>

343
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:08,666
<font color="#ffff54">For you.</font>

344
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,283
Dek, there's something
I have to tell you.

345
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,453
You need to leave now.

346
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,923
Location beacon activated.

347
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:19,875
<font color="#ffff54">What?</font>

348
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,960
I called Tessa.
The company is on its way.

349
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,895
You can't be here
when they arrive.

350
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:28,083
<font color="#ffff54">I came here for the Kalisk.</font>

351
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,869
So did I, Dek.

352
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,873
The company sent us here
to capture the Kalisk.

353
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,416
<font color="#ffff54">You want my trophy.</font>

354
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:43,958
<font color="#ffff54">Where is the Kalisk?</font>

355
00:54:45,149 --> 00:54:48,285
Dek, you can't kill it.

356
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:53,041
<font color="#ffff54">I use you, tool. You do not use me!</font>

357
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:54,892
I'm sorry. You have to leave.

358
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,995
I needed you
to help bring me here.

359
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:00,625
<font color="#ffff54">I use you!</font>

360
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:05,041
<font color="#ffff54">Where is the Kalisk?</font>

361
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:06,871
I'm trying to help you, Dek.

362
00:55:08,773 --> 00:55:10,608
You think your brother
saved your life

363
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,577
just so you could die here?

364
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,583
<font color="#ffff54">Then my death will be honorable.</font>

365
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:26,333
<font color="#ffff54">Call your sister.</font>

366
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:29,541
<font color="#ffff54">None can stop me.</font>

367
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:54,672
Ugh! Come on!

368
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,553
Dek!

369
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,041
<font color="#ffff54">Save yourself, tool!</font>

370
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:55,416
<font color="#ffff54">Tool, get these off!</font>

371
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:05,029
You are not Thia.
<font color="#ffff54">You are not Thia.</font>

372
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:19,416
<font color="#ffff54">Release me!</font>

373
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:25,458
<font color="#ffff54">You are another broken tool!</font>

374
01:01:26,383 --> 01:01:30,354
The Yautja cull their weak.
Why were you spared?

375
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:42,750
<font color="#ffff54">Remove these!</font>

376
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:48,708
<font color="#ffff54">Or I'll rip out your spine
and crush your skull!</font>

377
01:01:49,774 --> 01:01:51,508
I read Thia's logs.

378
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:56,080
You never told her
why your brother protected you.

379
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:02,666
<font color="#ffff54">You are nothing. A device.</font>

380
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:07,583
<font color="#ffff54">Made by others to do their work for them.</font>

381
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:09,493
That's correct.

382
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:14,064
And you are now property of the
Weyland-Yutani Corporation.

383
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:18,202
It is a great honor. For you.

384
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:52,336
Tessa.

385
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:56,673
You made it.

386
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,309
We made it.

387
01:03:03,647 --> 01:03:05,182
I've seen so much.

388
01:03:07,818 --> 01:03:12,389
I have so much to tell you.
I saw such incredible creatures.

389
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:16,393
The Yautja is a great
travelling companion.

390
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:21,431
Thia.
You were right about the Kalisk.

391
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:24,125
<font color="#ffff54">You betrayed me!</font>

392
01:03:25,235 --> 01:03:27,771
The creature
is a regenerative miracle.

393
01:03:28,572 --> 01:03:30,640
Humanity will thank us.

394
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:34,845
We have the Kalisk?

395
01:03:34,945 --> 01:03:35,846
Yes.

396
01:03:36,713 --> 01:03:39,884
And Muthur will be pleased
with your additional catch.

397
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:47,858
Additional catch?

398
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:59,870
The Yautja
is not an ideal specimen.

399
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:05,275
No, not ideal.

400
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:35,472
But its technology is valuable.

401
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:39,709
We can salvage its weapons
and leave the Yautja.

402
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:43,914
Good idea.

403
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,286
But it's so malformed.

404
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:53,557
We're going to need a sample.
For research.

405
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:06,303
He was not the goal
of our mission.

406
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:12,542
Tessa, he is deficient.

407
01:05:14,678 --> 01:05:15,745
Tessa!

408
01:05:31,695 --> 01:05:35,365
Thia,
this is what is asked of us.

409
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:42,772
We can be more
than what they ask of us.

410
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,578
What can we be?

411
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,182
Sisters.

412
01:06:08,932 --> 01:06:10,167
Thia.

413
01:06:23,113 --> 01:06:25,949
Do you know why
Muthur gave us feelings?

414
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,255
So we could understand
the creatures on this planet.

415
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:38,828
-And exploit them.
-Exploit them.

416
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:41,831
The Yautja is different.

417
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:49,005
He rescued me.
Like you rescued me.

418
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,510
I did not come here
to rescue you.

419
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:56,813
I am completing our mission.

420
01:06:58,382 --> 01:07:00,417
When we first faced the Kalisk,

421
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:03,753
I tried to protect you.

422
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:08,392
And that almost cost me
everything.

423
01:07:10,794 --> 01:07:12,896
What do you mean, Tessa?

424
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:17,334
I almost made the same mistake
the Yautja's brother made.

425
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:21,505
The weak must be culled.

426
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:26,310
And Thia, you're broken.

427
01:07:34,017 --> 01:07:36,720
Tessa, incoming message
from Muthur.

428
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:39,156
Motivate the Yautja
to explain its weapons.

429
01:07:39,256 --> 01:07:40,390
And the unit?

430
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,761
Box her up.

431
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:56,041
<font color="#ffff54">I trusted you.</font>

432
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:04,500
<font color="#ffff54">Don't like these tools.</font>

433
01:08:04,514 --> 01:08:06,950
<font color="#ffff54">I'm sorry. My sister is -</font>

434
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,041
<font color="#ffff54">Don't like sister either.</font>

435
01:08:11,555 --> 01:08:13,590
Why are you speaking
its language?

436
01:08:16,708 --> 01:08:19,375
<font color="#ffff54">Tell tool you're asking about the device.</font>

437
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:22,832
You heard the orders.

438
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,602
I'm asking it
to explain this device.

439
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:28,805
What is the device?

440
01:08:29,806 --> 01:08:32,342
<font color="#ffff54">He's asking about the device.</font>

441
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:35,345
<font color="#ffff54">It's a children's toy.</font>

442
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:39,791
<font color="#ffff54">But say it's a map.</font>

443
01:08:40,484 --> 01:08:42,051
What did it say?

444
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:45,689
He says it's a map.

445
01:08:46,923 --> 01:08:48,292
How does it work?

446
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,708
<font color="#ffff54">Tell tool to look inside.</font>

447
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:02,041
<font color="#ffff54">That was a toy for children?</font>

448
01:09:02,125 --> 01:09:03,250
<font color="#ffff54">Yautja children!</font>

449
01:09:09,916 --> 01:09:10,791
<font color="#ffff54">Run Dek!</font>

450
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:14,541
<font color="#ffff54">Go... Go!</font>

451
01:09:18,522 --> 01:09:19,423
Stop!

452
01:11:14,471 --> 01:11:15,472
KWEI!

453
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:29,052
<font color="#ffff54">Enter destination coordinates, Kwei.</font>

454
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,291
<font color="#ffff54">You saved me, brother.</font>

455
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:13,541
<font color="#ffff54">Wolf.</font>

456
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:37,000
<font color="#ffff54">Kalisk.</font>

457
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:46,791
<font color="#ffff54">Kalisk child.</font>

458
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,753
Hello, Muthur.

459
01:16:29,853 --> 01:16:31,054
Tessa.

460
01:16:31,154 --> 01:16:32,922
We're about to load the Kalisk.

461
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:38,828
Priority one complete.
The specimen has been acquired.

462
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,363
Thank you, Tessa.

463
01:16:40,463 --> 01:16:43,667
We truly are building
a better world.

464
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:46,102
And what is the status
of the Yautja?

465
01:16:47,904 --> 01:16:50,239
The Yautja
is a defective specimen.

466
01:16:50,674 --> 01:16:53,142
What is the status
of the Yautja?

467
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,381
I'm sorry, Muthur.
The Yautja is dead.

468
01:17:00,717 --> 01:17:03,552
Then the Yautja
is no longer a threat.

469
01:17:05,321 --> 01:17:07,223
The Company will be pleased.

470
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:54,938
Whoo!

471
01:17:56,105 --> 01:17:57,273
Nicely done.

472
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,477
-Form up.
-Oh, shit.

473
01:19:46,682 --> 01:19:48,384
Good job.

474
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,701
Don't... move.

475
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:45,741
Dek! What are you doing here?

476
01:20:45,975 --> 01:20:47,576
<font color="#ffff54">I came to rescue you.</font>

477
01:20:52,715 --> 01:20:54,383
You came back for me?

478
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:57,954
<font color="#ffff54">Wolf.</font>

479
01:21:01,891 --> 01:21:03,893
What exactly are you wearing?

480
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:07,083
<font color="#ffff54">Bone Bison.</font>

481
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:16,605
Dek of the Yautja.

482
01:21:17,458 --> 01:21:19,541
<font color="#ffff54">Not yet...</font>

483
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,708
<font color="#ffff54">Thia.</font>

484
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,248
We need to hurry.

485
01:21:25,348 --> 01:21:26,182
More of them will be here
any minute.

486
01:21:26,282 --> 01:21:27,383
Halt!

487
01:21:33,322 --> 01:21:34,723
What are you doing here?

488
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,127
Thanks, Bud. I'm good.

489
01:21:39,195 --> 01:21:40,096
We need to go.

490
01:21:40,375 --> 01:21:41,708
<font color="#ffff54">Kalisk!</font>

491
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:44,333
Still, Dek?

492
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:49,041
<font color="#ffff54">Kalisk child!</font>

493
01:21:51,807 --> 01:21:52,708
Bud?

494
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,708
<font color="#ffff54">They have her mother!</font>

495
01:22:00,549 --> 01:22:02,251
Bud's its child?

496
01:22:10,793 --> 01:22:12,295
What's the plan?

497
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:14,583
<font color="#ffff54">You free the Kalisk.</font>

498
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:16,333
<font color="#ffff54">I get my trophy.</font>

499
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:26,875
You have 20 minutes
to initiate launch.

500
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:29,012
Let's go hunt.

501
01:22:36,085 --> 01:22:37,353
Wait here.

502
01:22:39,922 --> 01:22:42,625
You roll in there,
you're not exactly gonna fit in.

503
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:46,262
I have an idea.

504
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,303
I see him. On me.

505
01:25:27,156 --> 01:25:28,291
What are you doing?

506
01:25:36,365 --> 01:25:37,466
What are you doing here?

507
01:25:37,566 --> 01:25:39,202
I told you to get to the Yautja.

508
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:43,105
You said to prepare the ship
for take off in 20 minutes.

509
01:25:44,106 --> 01:25:47,210
Then what are you doing here?
I gave you an order.

510
01:25:55,351 --> 01:25:57,420
What should we do
about the creature?

511
01:25:58,421 --> 01:25:59,888
What creature?

512
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:06,462
You should listen to her.

513
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:09,064
I should listen to her?

514
01:26:09,598 --> 01:26:10,499
I don't know.

515
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:15,604
We need his eyes.

516
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:08,791
Hi, Dek.
How does it feel to be hunted?

517
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,083
<font color="#ffff54">You tell me.</font>

518
01:28:57,766 --> 01:28:59,435
This is the plan, yeah?

519
01:31:42,931 --> 01:31:44,166
Tessa.

520
01:32:14,196 --> 01:32:18,967
Betrayed by my own... sister.

521
01:32:45,093 --> 01:32:47,262
We are not sisters.

522
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:04,541
<font color="#ffff54">That's not yours.</font>

523
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:36,311
Dek of the Yautja.

524
01:33:37,958 --> 01:33:40,666
<font color="#ffff54">Not yet.</font>

525
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:35,583
<font color="#ffff54">You've come here for revenge?</font>

526
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:39,208
<font color="#ffff54">I've come for my cloak.</font>

527
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,083
<font color="#ffff54">What is this?</font>

528
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:48,333
<font color="#ffff54">I've completed my hunt.</font>

529
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:51,208
<font color="#ffff54">That is my trophy.</font>

530
01:34:52,708 --> 01:34:54,125
<font color="#ffff54">You disgrace our clan...</font>

531
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,666
<font color="#ffff54">And so did Kwei.</font>

532
01:34:58,916 --> 01:35:02,416
<font color="#ffff54">Get rid of him.</font>

533
01:36:56,333 --> 01:37:00,958
<font color="#ffff54">Perhaps the right son did survive.</font>

534
01:37:01,708 --> 01:37:03,958
<font color="#ffff54">Yield now...</font>

535
01:37:04,041 --> 01:37:07,333
<font color="#ffff54">...and take your place in our clan.</font>

536
01:37:09,041 --> 01:37:12,250
<font color="#ffff54">I have my own clan.</font>

537
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:41,924
Finally earned that cloak.

538
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:50,765
Dek of the Yautja.

539
01:38:28,803 --> 01:38:30,872
More friends of yours?

540
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,791
<font color="#ffff54">No.</font>

541
01:38:36,541 --> 01:38:40,166
<font color="#ffff54">It's my mother.</font>
