1
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,190
- You're looking good, Dutch.
- It's been a long time, General.

2
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,560
Come on inside.

3
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,320
18 hours ago, we lost a chopper...
carrying a cabinet minister and his aide

4
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,530
from this charming little country.

5
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,620
We've got a transponder fixed
on their position... about here.

6
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,920
This cabinet minister, does he always travel
on the wrong side of the border?

7
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,090
Apparently, they strayed off course.
We're fairly certain they're in guerrilla hands.

8
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,880
So why don't you use the regular army?
What do you need us for?

9
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,300
Cos some damn fool
accused you of being the best.

10
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,650
Dillon.

11
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,940
You son of a bitch.

12
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,370
What's the matter? The CIA got you
pushing too many pencils?

13
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,750
- Had enough?
- Make it easy on yourself, Dutch.

14
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,720
- Never did know when to quit.
- Damn good to see you, Dutch.

15
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,850
- What is this fucking tie business?
- Forget about my tie.

16
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,520
I heard about that job you pulled
off in Berlin. Very nice, Dutch.

17
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,350
- Good old days.
- Yeah, like the good old days.

18
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,860
- Then how come you passed on Libya?
- That wasn't my style.

19
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,320
You got no style, Dutch. You know that.

20
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,900
Come on. Why'd you pass?

21
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,450
We're a rescue team, not assassins.

22
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,790
Now, what we gotta do?

23
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,540
That cabinet minister
is important to our scope of operations.

24
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,800
A couple of our friends are about to
get squeezed and we can't let that happen.

25
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,340
We need the best. That's why you're here.

26
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,090
- Go on.
- Simple setup. One-day operation.

27
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,640
We pick up their trail at the chopper,
grab those hostages, and bounce back.

28
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,690
- What do you mean, "we"?
- I'm goin' in with you, Dutch.

29
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,610
General, my team always works alone.
You know that.

30
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,030
I'm afraid we all have our orders, Major.

31
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,700
Once you reach your objective, Dillon will
evaluate the situation and take charge.

32
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,480
<i>Delta One-Zero to Two Leader.</i>

33
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,240
Rendezvous points and radio freqs
are indicated and fixed.

34
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,910
- AWACS contact on four-hour intervals.
- Who's our backup?

35
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,660
No such thing. This is a one-way ticket.

36
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,200
Once we cross that border, we're on our own.

37
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,620
This is getting better by the minute.

38
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,480
Billy!

39
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,020
Billy! The other day
I went up to my girlfriend. I said,

40
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,520
"You know, I'd like a little pussy. "

41
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,820
She said, "Me, too.
Mine's as big as a house. "

42
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,160
You see, she wanted
a littler one cos hers was...

43
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,870
big as a house.

44
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,630
Get that stinkin' shit out of my face.

45
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,510
Bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here.

46
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,850
This stuff'll make you
a goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus,

47
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,720
just like me.

48
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,230
Strap this on your sore ass, Blain.

49
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,990
That was in '72. Me and Dutch both got one.

50
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,680
That's a real nasty habit you got there.

51
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,750
<i>You got it, Leader.</i>

52
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,380
Never knew how much I missed this, Dutch.

53
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,050
You never were that smart.

54
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,030
Hawkins, you're up.

55
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,200
<i>Lines away.</i>

56
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,820
The pilots have been shot in the head.
Whoever hit it stripped the shit out of it.

57
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,490
- Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
- There's something else, Major.

58
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,700
This is no ordinary army taxi.

59
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,120
It looks more like a
surveillance bird to me.

60
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,050
- Pick up the trail yet?
- Billy's on it.

61
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:34,180
Heat seeker, Dillon. Pretty sophisticated
for a bunch of half-assed mountain boys.

62
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,010
I guess they're getting
better equipped every day.

63
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,220
There were 12 guerrillas.

64
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,890
They took the two men from the helicopter,
but there's something else.

65
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,310
- What do you mean?
- Six men wearing US-issued army boots.

66
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,690
They came in from the north,
and then they followed the guerrillas.

67
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,150
Mean anything to you?

68
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,080
Probably just another rebel patrol.
They operate in here all the time.

69
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,410
Get ahead and see what you can find.

70
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,110
What's he got?

71
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,570
Same business. Guerrillas hauling
two guys from the chopper,

72
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,580
followed by men with American equipment.

73
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,700
Do you remember Afghanistan?

74
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,120
Trying to forget it. Come on.

75
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,550
Holy mother of God.

76
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,410
Jim Hopper.

77
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,910
Mac, cut 'em down.

78
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,670
I knew these men.

79
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,890
Green Berets out of Fort Bragg.
What the hell were they doing here?

80
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,140
I don't know, Dutch. This is inhuman.

81
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,140
Nobody told me
there was an operation in this area.

82
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,060
- They shouldn't have been here.
- Somebody sent them.

83
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,740
The guerrillas skinned them?

84
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,360
Why did they skin them?

85
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,950
Ain't no way for no soldier to die.

86
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,920
- What happened here, Billy?
- Strange, Major.

87
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,630
There was a firefight.

88
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,920
They were shooting in all directions.

89
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,420
I can't believe Hopper
walked into an ambush.

90
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,300
I don't believe he did.

91
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,640
I can't find a single track.

92
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,890
- It just doesn't make sense.
- What about the rest of Hopper's men?

93
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,560
There's no sign, sir.

94
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,940
They never left here.

95
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,990
It's like they just disappeared.

96
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,490
Stick with the guerrilla trail.
Let's get the hostages.

97
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,790
We move, five-metre spread. No sound.

98
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,540
It's time to let old painless out the bag.

99
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,380
Payback time.

100
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,480
You're ghostin' us, motherfucker.
I don't care who you are back in the world.

101
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,270
You give our position one more time, I'll
bleed you, real quiet, and leave you here.

102
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,530
Got that?

103
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,230
Fuck you.

104
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,800
He killed one of the hostages. We move.

105
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,970
Mac, Blain - the nest.

106
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,850
Billy, Poncho - the guard.
Hawkins, Dillon - backup.

107
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,390
As soon as they're set, I hit the fuel dump.

108
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,410
One down.

109
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,390
What the hell's he doin'?

110
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,870
What the fuck?

111
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,630
Showtime, kid.

112
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,200
Target's the centre of the palapa.

113
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,680
Dutch, on your nine.

114
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,620
Get that mother.

115
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,130
Stick around.

116
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,840
Hostages inside.

117
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,100
Knock, knock.

118
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,650
I got 'em.

119
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:49,530
Hawkins, call in position and situation.
Get Con Op on the hook.

120
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,610
You got it, Major.

121
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,290
Shit.

122
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,040
Mac. Any sign of the other hostage?

123
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:10,680
Found the other guy - he's dead, too -
and the gear from the chopper.

124
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,050
But if they're Central American,
I'm a goddamn Chinaman.

125
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,890
From the looks of it, our cabinet minister was
CIA. Another thing, Major. We were lucky.

126
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,310
Other guys they waxed...
were Russian military advisers.

127
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,690
Something pretty big
was gonna happen here.

128
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,440
Good work, Mac. Clear the area. No traces.

129
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,280
Get the men ready to move.

130
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,580
Son of a bitch is dug
in like an Alabama tick.

131
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:46,750
- You're hit. You're bleedin', man.
- I ain't got time to bleed.

132
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,930
You got time to duck?

133
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,940
This is goddamn beautiful.

134
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,740
Goddamn jackpot.
This is more than we ever thought we'd get.

135
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,450
We got those bastards.

136
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,660
- We got 'em.
- I think this is what you're looking for.

137
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:26,080
You set us up. It's all bullshit. All of it.

138
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:30,340
The cabinet minister, the whole business.
Got us in here to do your dirty work.

139
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,220
We stopped a major invasion. In three
days they'd have crossed the border.

140
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,800
- Why us?
- Because nobody else could've pulled it off.

141
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:42,850
- You're pissed about the cover story.
- So, what story did you hand to Hopper?

142
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:47,860
We've been looking for this place for months.
My men were in that chopper when it got hit.

143
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,150
- Hopper went in and he disappeared.
- He didn't disappear. He was skinned alive.

144
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,900
I had to get somebody
who could crack these bastards.

145
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:59,490
So you cooked up a story
and dropped the six of us in a meat grinder.

146
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,580
What happened to you, Dillon?

147
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,540
You used to be somebody I could trust.

148
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:10,000
I woke up.

149
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,420
Why don't you?

150
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,510
You're an asset,

151
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,220
an expendable asset,

152
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,310
and I used you to get the job done. Got it?

153
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,060
My men are not expendable.

154
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,770
And I don't do this kind of work.

155
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:35,780
Major, we stepped into some real shit here.

156
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:40,740
We've got guerrillas all over the place.
Can't be more than one, two miles away.

157
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,950
- How much time?
- Half an hour, maybe less.

158
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,460
- Tell Mac we move in five.
- She goes with us. She's too valuable.

159
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,540
She'll give away our position
any chance she gets. No deal.

160
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,880
You're still under orders, Major.

161
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,800
Now, you wanna make that call or should I?

162
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:00,680
She's your baggage.
You fall behind and you're on your own.

163
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,940
This place is too hot for a pickup. They
won't touch us till we get over the border.

164
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:19,240
Billy. Give me a way out of this hole.
Aerial says we are cut off.

165
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,080
The only way outta here
is that valley that leads to the east.

166
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,740
I wouldn't waste that on a broke-dick dog.

167
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,960
Not much choice.

168
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,130
Poncho, take lead. Double-time it.

169
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,900
Dillon.

170
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,530
Over here.

171
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,250
- Turn around.
- Why?

172
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,760
Thanks.

173
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,270
Any time.

174
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,610
Billy.

175
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,320
The other day
I was goin' down on my girlfriend.

176
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,700
I said to her, "Jeez, you've got a big
pussy. Jeez, you've got a big pussy. "

177
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,370
She said, "Why did you say that twice?"
I said, "I didn't. "

178
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:53,790
See, it was cos of the echo.

179
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,670
Over here.

180
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,010
Turn around.

181
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,260
Turn around. Over here.

182
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,270
Any time.

183
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,990
Any time.

184
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,720
Goddamn.

185
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,440
Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.

186
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,070
I've seen some bad-ass bush before, man,
but nothin' like this.

187
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:51,650
I hear you. This shit's somethin'.

188
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,160
Makes Cambodia look like Kansas.

189
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,160
Hey, a little taste of home.

190
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,380
You lose it here, you're in a world of hurt.

191
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:18,390
Come on. Stop sandbaggin' it. Now, get up.

192
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,310
Come on, get up. Would you get up?

193
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,700
Maybe you'd better
put her on a leash, agent man.

194
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,460
Try it again... please.

195
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,070
What's got Billy so spooked?

196
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,190
Can't say, Major.

197
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,990
Been acting squirrely all morning.

198
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:00,570
That damn nose of his... it's weird.

199
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,490
What is it?

200
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,580
Billy...

201
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,210
What the hell is wrong with you?

202
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,380
There's something in those trees.

203
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,460
Do you see anything?

204
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,630
Up there.

205
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,010
Nothing.

206
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,850
What do you think?

207
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,110
I guess it's nothing, Major.

208
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:55,040
Please.

209
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,410
Billy, break left.

210
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,410
Mac, right.

211
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:15,910
- What the? This isn't her blood.
- What the hell'd you do to him?

212
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,120
Major... you'd better take a look at this.

213
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,210
Did you find Hawkins?

214
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:22,920
I...

215
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,210
I can't tell.

216
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,770
What in God's name?

217
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,070
I think it's Hawkins.

218
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,410
- Where the hell is his body?
- There's no sign of it.

219
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,450
Ask her what happened.

220
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:20,060
She says the jungle...
it just came alive and took him.

221
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,400
Bullshit. That's not what she said.

222
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:27,230
- It doesn't make sense.
- Those sappers have followed us...

223
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,030
They've been in front of us. This woman...

224
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,490
Hold it.

225
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:37,120
Hold it. Why didn't they take
his radio or his weapon?

226
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,700
Why didn't she escape?

227
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:44,500
- Hopper.
- What?

228
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:50,670
They did the same thing to Jim Hopper.

229
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:59,720
I want Hawkins' body found. Sweep pattern.
Double back. 50 metres. Let's go.

230
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,000
Come on in, you fuckers.

231
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,670
Come on in.

232
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,260
Old painless is waitin'.

233
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,540
Sergeant.

234
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:37,210
Motherfucker.

235
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,560
- What happened?
- I saw it.

236
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,940
- You saw what?
- I saw it.

237
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:32,500
Blain.

238
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:36,380
No powder burns, no shrapnel.

239
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:42,090
The wound's all fused, cauterised.
What the hell could have done this to a man?

240
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:43,720
Mac.

241
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,510
Mac, look at me.

242
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:49,760
- Who did this?
- I don't know, goddamn it.

243
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:52,640
I saw something.

244
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,020
Not a thing. Not a fuckin' trace.

245
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:01,610
No blood, no bodies. We hit nothing.

246
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:12,990
Dillon, better get on the radio.

247
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,500
Mac.

248
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,920
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

249
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,130
I want a defensive position above that ridge
mined with everything we've got.

250
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:29,640
- Put him in his poncho. Take him with us.
- I got him.

251
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:37,700
Major, I set up flares, frags and claymores.

252
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,630
Nothing's coming near this place
without tripping on somethin'.

253
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,130
Thank you, Sergeant.

254
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,010
Mac.

255
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:51,430
He was a good soldier.

256
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:54,640
He was...

257
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,720
my friend.

258
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,090
Goodbye, bro.

259
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:18,240
Blazer One, I repeat, extraction necessary.

260
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,780
Say again, Blazer One. Say again.

261
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:25,160
<i>Request for extraction denied.
Area is still compromised.</i>

262
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:31,210
<i>Proceed to sector 3,000 for prisoner
extraction. Priority, out. Next contact 0930.</i>

263
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:34,340
Roger, Blazer One. 1030 hours.

264
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,510
Damn bastards.

265
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:39,590
They say we're still in too far.
They can't risk coming in.

266
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,140
We're assets, Dillon. Expendable assets.

267
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,850
It comes with the job. I can accept it.

268
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:48,600
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.

269
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:54,730
Shitload of good a chopper's
gonna do us in here anyhow.

270
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:00,450
Sergeant?

271
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,030
Sergeant. Who hit us today?

272
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,830
I don't know.

273
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:09,620
I only saw one of them camouflaged.

274
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:12,000
He was there.

275
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:14,420
Those eyes disappeared.

276
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,510
What was that?

277
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,470
Those eyes, they...

278
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:20,510
they disappeared.

279
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:25,220
I know one thing, Major.
I drew and fired straight at it.

280
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:29,890
Capped off 200 rounds
in the Minigun... Full pack.

281
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:34,070
Nothing... nothing on this earth
could have lived.

282
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:37,570
Not at that range.

283
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:44,530
Mac, you take first watch,
then you get some rest.

284
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:50,750
Ask her. Ask her what she saw.
Ask her what happened to Hawkins.

285
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,790
Go ahead. Ask her.

286
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:07,430
She says the same fuckin' thing.
The jungle, it came alive and took him.

287
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,190
Billy... you know something. What is it?

288
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:16,900
- I'm scared, Poncho.
- Bullshit. You ain't afraid of no man.

289
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:20,990
There's something out there waiting for us,

290
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:24,120
and it ain't no man.

291
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,790
We're all gonna die.

292
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:42,180
He's losing his cool. There's a couple of
guys out there and we gotta take 'em down.

293
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:45,340
You still don't understand, Dillon, do you?

294
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:49,560
Whatever it is out there, it killed Hopper,

295
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,060
and now it wants us.

296
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:59,900
Here we are again, bro,

297
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,450
just you and me.

298
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:05,910
Same kind of moon and same kind of jungle.

299
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:08,990
Real number 10 night, remember?

300
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:13,920
Whole platoon, 32 men chopped into meat,
and we walk out, just you and me.

301
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Nobody else. Right on top, bro.

302
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:23,590
Not a scratch. Not a fuckin' scratch.
You know, whoever got you,

303
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:29,060
he'll come back again, and when he does,
I'm gonna cut your name right into him.

304
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:32,810
I'm gonna cut your name into him.

305
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:54,000
Mac.

306
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,580
- This way.
- Where the hell are you?

307
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:00,750
Where are you?

308
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,980
Where are you?

309
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,570
Mac, where are you?

310
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:24,610
Jesus.

311
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:26,900
I got you, motherfucker.

312
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:29,450
I killed you, you fuck.

313
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:32,700
Jesus. You killed a pig.

314
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:35,710
Do you think you could have found
something bigger?

315
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:38,710
Fuck you, Poncho. Fuck you.

316
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,800
- Where's the girl?
- Shit.

317
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:47,130
Why wasn't anybody watching her?

318
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:53,680
Why didn't she try to get away?

319
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,230
Look at her. She's scared out of her mind.

320
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:00,770
Major, you better take a look at this.

321
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:09,320
Blain's body, it's gone.

322
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:11,820
It came in through the tripwires.

323
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:15,370
Took it right out from under our noses.

324
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:33,300
That boar had to set off the trip flare,
Major, cos there ain't no other tracks.

325
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:37,890
How could anyone get through this
and carry out Blain without us knowing it?

326
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:41,230
And why didn't he try and kill one of us?

327
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:44,360
He came in to get the body.

328
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,690
He's killing us one at a time.

329
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,240
Like a hunter.

330
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:08,800
He's using the trees.

331
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,520
Yesterday, what did you see?

332
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,110
- You're wasting your time.
- No more games.

333
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:30,860
I don't know what it was.

334
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:33,820
- It...
- Go on.

335
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:36,990
It changed colours like the chameleon.

336
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,580
It uses the jungle.

337
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:43,040
Are you sayin' Blain and Hawkins were killed
by a fuckin' lizard?

338
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:48,880
That's a bullshit psych job. There's two
or three men at the most. Fucking lizard.

339
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:53,720
- What's your name?
- Anna.

340
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:04,020
Anna, this thing is hunting us. All of us.

341
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:07,110
You know that.

342
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:12,570
- What the hell are you doing?
- We need everyone.

343
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:15,910
- I'm taking her back. We're out of here.
- We're not going yet.

344
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:19,240
The rendezvous is 10 miles away.
You think the chopper'll wait?

345
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:24,330
Dillon, we make a stand now, or there will
be nobody left to go to the chopper.

346
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,880
There is something else.

347
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,840
When the big man was killed,
you must have wounded it.

348
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,630
Its blood was on the leaves.

349
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,640
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

350
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:05,710
Look out.

351
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:29,860
You really think
this boy-scout bullshit's gonna work.

352
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:33,780
It can see our tripwires.
Maybe it can't see this.

353
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:37,320
Instead of complaining,
maybe you should help.

354
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:38,840
What makes you think
he'll come in through here?

355
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:43,680
There are tripwires on every tree for
50 yards. This is the only way in.

356
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,670
When I was little, we found a man.

357
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,750
He looked like,

358
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,920
like, butchered.

359
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,630
The old women in the village
crossed themselves

360
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:23,260
and whispered crazy things,
said strange things.

361
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:30,520
Only in the hottest years this happens.

362
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:36,400
And this year it grows hot.

363
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:40,110
We begin finding our men.

364
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:43,700
We found them sometimes without their skin,

365
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:47,120
and sometimes much, much worse.

366
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:56,880
<i>"El que hace trofeos de los hombres" means
"the demon who makes trophies of man. "</i>

367
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:19,400
So, what you gonna try next? Cheese?

368
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:25,490
Hey, Dutch!

369
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,270
Shit.

370
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:13,560
Got you, motherfucker. I got you.

371
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,600
I'm coming.

372
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:22,480
Mac. Mac. Get Ramirez on his feet
and get to the chopper.

373
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,780
- Hold it. I'm going after Mac.
- That's not your style, Dillon.

374
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:29,740
I picked up some bad habits from you.
Get your people the hell outta here.

375
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:32,530
You can't win this, Dillon.

376
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:35,490
Maybe I can get even.

377
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,040
Dillon.

378
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:45,670
Just hold on to that damn chopper.

379
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:55,260
He's busted up pretty bad, Major.

380
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:59,980
- I can make it. I can make it.
- Get the radio. Forget the rest.

381
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,850
Come on, Poncho.

382
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:26,380
Long tall Sally

383
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:28,130
She's built sweet

384
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:31,550
She got everything that Uncle John need

385
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:33,550
Oh, baby

386
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:36,260
Baby

387
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,810
I'm gonna have me some fun

388
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:41,230
I'm gonna have me some fun

389
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,050
Turn around.

390
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,640
Over here.

391
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:23,350
Over here.

392
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:31,730
Mac?

393
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:48,500
Out there. Past them trees.

394
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,800
You see it?

395
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,180
I see you.

396
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:10,820
I see it.

397
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:17,820
I see it.

398
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:25,790
You know, we can get this thing, Mac.
You work your way down there toward him.

399
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:31,880
I'll get in back of him, flush him toward you.
When I flush that son of a bitch, you nail him.

400
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,800
I got a score to settle.

401
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,380
We've both got scores to settle.

402
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:09,180
Come on. Quickly. Hurry up.

403
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:13,400
Don't. Leave it. It didn't kill you
because you weren't armed.

404
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,570
No sport.

405
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,220
Mac.

406
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:00,740
Any time.

407
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:18,900
Let's go.

408
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:30,490
Billy.

409
01:14:30,990 --> 01:14:33,410
Billy, let's go.

410
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:01,150
Give me the weapon.

411
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:57,580
No.

412
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:59,540
Run.

413
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:10,220
Run.

414
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,680
Go.

415
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,050
Get to the chopper.

416
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,520
Oh, shit.

417
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,330
He couldn't see me.

418
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:09,130
Bleed, bastard.

419
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:44,720
You're one ugly motherfucker.

420
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:05,490
Bad idea.

421
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,070
Come on.

422
01:38:05,570 --> 01:38:08,030
Come on. Do it.

423
01:38:08,110 --> 01:38:10,200
Do it.

424
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:13,330
Come on. Come on.

425
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:16,460
Kill me. I'm here. Kill me.

426
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,960
I'm here. Kill me.

427
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,960
Come on. Kill me. I'm here.

428
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:25,220
Come on. Do it now. Kill me.

429
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:47,550
What the hell are you?

430
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:56,560
What the hell are you?

431
01:41:11,130 --> 01:41:13,510
What the?

432
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:18,810
My God.
