1
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,671
No!

2
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,582
There she is. There she is.

3
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,426
There she is.

4
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,081
Ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:39,335
I've traveled over half our state
to be here tonight.

6
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,963
I couldn't get away sooner
because my new well was coming in

7
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,966
at Coyote Hills
and I had to see about it.

8
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,094
That well is now flowing
at 2,000 barreIs

9
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,389
and it's paying me an income
of $5,000 a week.

10
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,351
I have two others drilling
and I have 16 producing at Antelope,

11
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:59,898
so, ladies and gentlemen,
if I say I'm an oilman, you will agree.

12
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,403
Now, you have a great chance here,

13
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,406
but bear in mind you could lose it all
if you're not careful.

14
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,909
Out of all men that beg for a chance
to drill your lots,

15
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,245
maybe one in twenty will be oilmen.

16
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,580
The rest will be speculators,

17
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,207
that's men trying to get between
you and the oilmen

18
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,920
to get some of the money that ought,
by rights, come to you.

19
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,964
Even if you find one that has money
and means to drill,

20
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,508
he'll maybe know nothing about drilling.

21
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,594
He'll have to hire the job out
on contract,

22
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,513
and then you're depending
on a contractor,

23
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,681
who'll rush the job through

24
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,892
so he can get another contract
just as quick as he can.

25
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,560
This is the way that this works.

26
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,939
What is your offer? We're wasting time.

27
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,190
Please!

28
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,362
I do my own drilling.

29
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,908
And the men that work for me,
work for me, and they are men I know.

30
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,745
I make it my business to be there
and to see their work.

31
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,957
I don't lose my tools in the hole
and spend months fishing for them.

32
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,208
I don't botch the cementing off

33
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,878
and let water in the hole
and ruin the whole lease.

34
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,005
I'm a family man.

35
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,760
I run a family business. This is my son
and my partner, H.W. Plainview.

36
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,557
We offer you the bond of family
that very few oilmen can understand.

37
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,604
I'm fixed like no other company
in this field

38
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,899
and that's because
my Coyote Hills well has just come in.

39
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,485
I have a string of tools
all ready to put to work.

40
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,737
I can load a rig onto trucks
and have them here in a week.

41
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,907
I have business connections,
so I can get the lumber for the derricks.

42
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:36,828
Such things go by friendship
in a rush like this.

43
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:40,790
And this is why I can guarantee
to start drilling

44
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,835
and to put up the cash to back my word.

45
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,503
I assure you, ladies and gentlemen,

46
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,923
no matter what the others
promise to do,

47
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,468
when it comes to the showdown,
they won't be there.

48
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,723
Sit down! Sit down, you have no right...

49
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,726
Let us discuss what the man has to say.

50
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,854
-Prescott, do you trust this man?
-Let's discuss what he has to say.

51
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:06,441
-There's logic to what he's saying.
-How does he know? My lot is there!

52
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,362
Two or three years,
it could be ten years!

53
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,615
-We gain nothing by losing our heads!
-Look at that well out there!

54
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,284
Nobody's losing their heads.

55
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,787
You have no business being here!

56
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,249
Sit that woman down, sir!

57
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,294
You can sit down.

58
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,880
Mr. Plainview! Please, Mr. Plainview.

59
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,966
No, Mr. Plainview!
No, where are you going?

60
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,178
-I don't need the lease. Thank you.
-But we need you.

61
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,513
Too much confusion.
Thank you for your time.

62
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,307
No, no, there's no confusion.

63
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,102
I wouldn't take the lease
if you gave it to me as a gift.

64
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,532
Mr. Bankside,
I'm not going to waste your time.

65
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,077
I'd certainly appreciate it
if you didn't waste mine.

66
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:03,915
Now, if you wish to sign with me, we
can have a well drilling within 1 0 days.

67
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,460
Your lot is further north
from the discovery well up here.

68
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,171
That means
we'll probably have to dig deeper.

69
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,673
And if there's as much oil here
as I think there is,

70
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,760
it'll be harder to reach, but once
we find it, we can take it right out.

71
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:20,515
We have to act quickly, because
very soon these fields will be dry.

72
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,934
I need you to know what you want to do.

73
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,062
Now, because of the distance
from the discovery well,

74
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,439
I'll pay you a smaller royalty
than you'd get down there

75
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:32,360
but l'm prepared to give you
a $1 ,000 bonus on your lot.

76
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,028
What kind of royalty
are you talking about?

77
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:38,574
One-sixth, plus a guarantee
to start drilling within 1 0 days.

78
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,911
Now, that's something
you won't find anywhere else.

79
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,797
What age are your children, ma'am?

80
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,632
Ten and twelve.

81
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:59,637
Mr. Plainview, a question, sir.
Where is your wife?

82
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,600
She died in childbirth, Mrs. Bankside.

83
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,020
So it's just me and my son now.

84
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,737
lt's coming in, boss!

85
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,489
Hear it?

86
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,475
Mr. Plainview?

87
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,810
Yes?

88
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,148
Are you Daniel Plainview?

89
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,193
Yes.

90
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,821
What can l do for you?

91
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,450
You look for oil.

92
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,161
That's right.

93
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,331
What do you pay for a place that has it?

94
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,459
-Well, that depends.
-What does it depend on?

95
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,338
On a lot of things.

96
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:21,260
lf l told you l knew a place that had oil
where land could be bought cheaply,

97
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,138
what do you think that would be worth?

98
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,393
l think that you should let me know
what you know

99
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,647
and then we'll try
and work something out.

100
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,817
-Can l sit down?
-Please.

101
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,248
What church do you belong to?

102
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,255
l...

103
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,927
l enjoy all faiths. l don't belong
to one church in particular.

104
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:07,056
l like them all. l like everything.
Where are you from?

105
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,018
That would be telling you.
That's what l want to sell you.

106
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,148
What are you doing in Signal Hill?

107
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,651
We have oil,
and it seeps through the ground.

108
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,319
Do you want to pay me
to know where it is?

109
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,487
Just 'cause there's something
on the ground

110
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,364
doesn't mean
there's anything beneath it.

111
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,200
Why did Standard Oil buy up land?

112
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,663
ls it in California?

113
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,709
-Maybe.
-How much land did they buy?

114
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,254
l'd like it better
if you didn't think l was stupid.

115
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,056
Why did you come to me?

116
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:53,477
-You just brought this well in.
-That's right.

117
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:57,898
Yes, so just give me $500 in cash
right now

118
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,443
and l'll tell you where it is.

119
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,820
l'll tell you what l'll do, son.
l'll give you $1 00 now,

120
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:07,575
and if it proves to be a promising lease,
then give you a $1 ,000 bonus.

121
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,618
Six hundred dollars.

122
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,333
Tell me one thing to help me decide.
What else have you got up there?

123
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,126
What do you grow?

124
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,963
We have a big ranch,
but it's mostly rocks.

125
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,549
Plant things.
Nothing will grow but weeds.

126
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,884
What makes you think it's up?

127
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:28,095
ls there sulfur around?
Or alkali deposits?

128
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,265
Alkali nearby. l don't know sulfur.

129
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,607
ls that your son?

130
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,359
Yes.

131
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,944
-Hi.
-Hi.

132
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,992
-Who are you?
-l'm Fletcher Hamilton.

133
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,078
Nice to meet you, son.
What's your name?

134
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,829
What do you do?

135
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,957
l work with Mr. Plainview.

136
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,377
Here's $500, son.

137
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:03,339
You tell me something worth hearing,
this money's yours.

138
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:11,180
l come from a town called Little Boston
in lsabella County.

139
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:17,770
This is us, here.
Spur station here at Little Boston.

140
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,898
The Sunday ranch
is what you're looking for.

141
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,234
There's a sheep trail
that takes you there.

142
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,320
lt's a mile out of town headed west,
not far.

143
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:30,324
Just through a small pass here
near the base of the hills.

144
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,161
You'll pass a church
and just follow the sheep trail.

145
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:38,457
-Where's Standard buying up?
-Here and here.

146
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,045
-Your family name is Sunday, yes?
-That's right.

147
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,630
How many's in your family?

148
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,967
My father and mother and sisters
and my brother Eli.

149
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,761
-How many sisters do you have?
-Two.

150
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,180
-What's your name?
-Paul.

151
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,517
Does any of your family know
about the oil that you say is there?

152
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,060
l don't know.

153
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,813
My uncle always said
there was oil there,

154
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:03,399
but l don't know what they heard
or what they think.

155
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,942
What do you grow?

156
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:10,197
lt's goats. lt's a goat farm.
l told you, nothing grows but weeds.

157
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,825
-ls there water?
-lt's salty.

158
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,328
You drill a well,
it's hard not to get saltwater.

159
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,584
The oil is there. l'm telling you.

160
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,425
-l want to go now, so...
-You can stay tonight.

161
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:33,637
-No, l want to go now. l want to leave.
-Listen, Paul.

162
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:40,269
lf l travel all the way out there
and l find that you've been lying to me,

163
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,980
l'm going to find you and l'm going
to take more than my money back.

164
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,316
ls that all right with you?

165
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,693
-Yes, sir.
-All right, then.

166
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:52,573
-Nice luck to you. God bless.
-And to you, young man.

167
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,008
-There's someone coming.
-Thank you, Mary.

168
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:47,271
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

169
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:53,068
My name's Daniel Plainview.
This is my son, H.W.

170
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,697
-Are you hunting?
-Hunting for quail.

171
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,658
We're told there might be a good place
to camp up near the Sunday ranch.

172
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,619
This is the Sunday ranch.
You can camp here.

173
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,455
-Thank you. Do you have water?
-Yes.

174
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,458
We heard there was an earthquake
up here a few days ago.

175
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,418
-ls that right?
-Yes.

176
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,964
-Your family?
-Yeah, all fine. Thank you.

177
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:19,053
-We have goat's milk, if you'd like.
-That would be fine.

178
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,056
Now,

179
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:27,978
if we set our tent away over there,
we'd be out of your way over there.

180
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,355
That's fine.

181
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,649
Ruth! Help these men
and bring them some water.

182
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,233
No! H.W.

183
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,572
Mr. Plainview,
would you like that milk now?

184
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:42,785
-That would be fine. Thank you.
-Mary! Bring them some milk.

185
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,328
My family will help you set up your tent.

186
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,664
No, please.
We set ourselves on this camping trip.

187
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,457
We have to do the camping.

188
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,958
Hurry up!

189
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,924
-Do you have bread?
-We have potatoes.

190
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,676
Potatoes would be nice, thank you.

191
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,260
l'll have them boil you up
some potatoes.

192
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,680
That's all right.
l thought maybe we'd make a fire.

193
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,015
l wanted to work with my son
on making a fire.

194
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,101
All right. My son, Eli, will bring you
some wood.

195
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,269
Thank you so much for your hospitality,
Mr. Sunday.

196
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,397
-Yes.
-And we'll be out of your way.

197
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,274
-We're just hunting for quail.
-Yes.

198
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,362
-l'm sorry we don't have any bread.
-No, no, no.

199
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,281
Corn doesn't fill out in the hills here.
lt's mostly rock.

200
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,243
We don't have room to raise the grain.

201
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,040
Thank you, young lady.

202
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,900
My name is Eli.

203
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,195
Yes, you're Eli Sunday.

204
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,614
Welcome.

205
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,995
-H.W.
-Eli.

206
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,420
-You're hunting quail?
-That's right.

207
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:25,179
-We will bring dinner.
-Thank you. Thank you so much.

208
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,470
Dad!

209
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,931
Dad, look at my shoe.

210
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,043
That's earthquake oil. Set loose.

211
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,860
So...

212
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,654
So?

213
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,907
So, so.

214
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,994
If there's anything here,
we take it to the sea.

215
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,874
What we do is we build a pipeline
to Port Hueneme or Santa Paula,

216
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,500
it's about 1 00 miles,

217
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,504
and we do a deal with Union Oil.
This is what we do.

218
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:08,008
Then we don't need the railroads
and their shipping costs anymore.

219
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,509
You see?

220
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,388
Yeah.

221
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,183
-You see that?
-Yeah.

222
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,478
Then we're making money.
We're making the real money.

223
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,438
What we should be making.
Not just...

224
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,941
Not just throwing it away
on shipping costs.

225
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,193
Otherwise, it's just mud.

226
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,033
How much are we going to pay them?

227
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,369
Who's that?

228
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,873
The Sunday family.

229
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,335
l'm not going to give them oil prices.

230
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,173
l'll give them quail prices.

231
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,514
lf we could take a few minutes,

232
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:58,767
there's something l'd very much
like to talk with you about.

233
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:02,229
Mother, would you take the girls
outside, please?

234
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,244
l believe in plain speaking, so...

235
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:21,039
This is a beautiful ranch.
l love hunting for quail.

236
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,960
My boy has been sick, you know.
He needs fresh air.

237
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,296
Doctors all say
he needs plentiful fresh air.

238
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,091
So,

239
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,681
what would you say would be
a fair price for this lot, Abel?

240
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,393
-To buy this place?
-That's right.

241
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,191
Take a moment.

242
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,782
-l'm sorry. l don't know.
-Six dollars an acre.

243
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,327
Six dollars? Thank you, Eli.

244
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:03,165
And then with the improvements
to the ranch over the years at $500...

245
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,834
l'd like to offer you $3,700
for this ranch.

246
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,545
-That's $3,700.
-No.

247
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,757
The Lord has sent this man here, Eli.

248
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,383
Yes, l believe He has.

249
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:17,596
-My offer to you is $3,700.
-What is it that brought you here, sir?

250
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,432
The Good Lord's guidance.

251
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,892
-Now, of course, within that...
-What about our oil?

252
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,643
...we're going to develop a lease.

253
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:28,482
-What's that?
-What about our oil?

254
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,276
What about it?

255
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,570
We have oil here.
That's worth something.

256
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,114
Do you have someone
who can drill for it?

257
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,158
-Do you think there's oil here?
-l know there is.

258
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,327
lt's very expensive to drill.

259
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,621
To get it up and out of the ground.
You ever tried that before?

260
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,790
-How much is it?
-Costly.

261
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:48,001
Well, our oil sits right up
on top of the ground.

262
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,754
l believe that's called seepage.

263
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,380
Doesn't necessarily mean
there's anything underneath.

264
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,674
-What would you give us for it?
-l don't know.

265
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,719
-Something you don't know.
-That's right.

266
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,016
What would you like, Eli?

267
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,020
Ten thousand dollars.

268
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,690
For what?

269
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,361
For my church.

270
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,831
That's good.

271
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,627
That's a good one.

272
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,255
Well...

273
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:38,135
lf we decide to drill for oil
and if the well begins to produce,

274
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,928
l'll give your church
a $5,000 signing bonus.

275
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:40,971
Ten thousand.

276
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,598
Do you want to find someone else
that's going to come here and drill, Eli?

277
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,810
Make the investment and do
all the hard work that goes into it?

278
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:50,814
l can just as easily hunt for quail
on another ranch as l can here, so...

279
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:55,569
Though l'll happily be a supporter
of your church for as long as l can.

280
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,487
For the bonus only.

281
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,076
Now, as it happens, l do have some
connections in the drilling business

282
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:07,747
who might help get us started.
How do you feel about this, Abel?

283
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,749
Yes. What Eli says.

284
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,044
Well, good! Let's draw up
some contracts and let's...

285
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,088
Let's give it a try.

286
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,259
Appreciate your help with this, Eli.

287
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,189
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

288
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,607
-Real estate?
-Yes.

289
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,775
Yes, l'd like to talk to you.

290
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:40,405
l'm looking for some land.
l just bought the Sunday ranch.

291
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:44,576
And, well, where's the map?

292
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,579
Where are the hills
behind the Sunday ranch?

293
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:51,374
That's here. lt's the Bandy tract.
He has over 600 acres.

294
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:55,545
Bandy, 600.

295
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:02,135
-What about this?
-A.C. Maude, Blodget, Redlick, Carr.

296
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,848
-What's it held at?
-Six dollars an acre.

297
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,892
Six.

298
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,644
What about this?

299
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,356
That's the Belvins,
and that could be got, l'm sure.

300
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,985
Can everything around here be got?

301
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,196
Sure.

302
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:49,015
Paul Sunday turned out
to be a good friend of ours.

303
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,309
That's right.

304
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:57,649
Well, you get here just as soon
as you can. Bring Fred English.

305
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,443
Good enough.

306
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,862
Thank you, porter.

307
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,076
-H.W., how are you?
-Fine, and you?

308
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,869
-Pretty good. Where's your dad?
-He's inside.

309
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,579
You fellas are a long way
from Signal Hill.

310
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,665
-Hello, Plainview.
-Hello, Gene.

311
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,293
-Good to see you.
-Charlie.

312
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:20,964
-On your way somewhere else?
-Passing through. Looking around.

313
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,591
-Funny to see you.
-Funny, isn't it?

314
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,469
You boys are a regular family business.

315
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,263
You boys are a little late.

316
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:32,434
-What did you find?
-l found some interesting prospects.

317
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,810
Did you hear Standard bought up?

318
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,521
-Mostly in the north, so far.
-That's what l hear.

319
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:40,066
l'm gonna tell you, Gene,
if you're gonna make a play, look east.

320
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:45,447
l'd rather it be you than someone else.
This mud around here has been taken.

321
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,117
lt must be easy when you have such
a cute face to carry around with you.

322
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:52,329
-Telling me how handsome my son is?
-Well, that l am.

323
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,582
That's very nice. Thank you.
Good luck, Gene.

324
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,168
-Take care.
-Like l said, go east.

325
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,419
H.W.

326
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,089
l'll be your lawyer
if you need to draw up a contract.

327
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:07,510
Make sure you don't get swindled, boy.
Get half what your dad's making.

328
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,397
How's that?

329
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,498
What are those men doing?

330
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,378
They're just guys
that are working for us.

331
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,797
They're just looking around.

332
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,259
How much money can we make?

333
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,641
l don't know. lt depends.

334
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,980
One thousand dollars?

335
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:12,575
Mary said that her father beats her
if she doesn't pray.

336
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,584
Mary, she's the smaller one?

337
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,797
Yes, she is.

338
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,105
-Everyone here?
-Very successful.

339
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:43,898
But?

340
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:47,402
There were a few vacant lots
and one holdout.

341
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,154
-Who?
-William Bandy.

342
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,322
...eight. Who's he?

343
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,824
He's an old man
who homesteaded here.

344
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:56,077
Lives with his grandson.
He said he'd like to speak with you.

345
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,370
ls he here?

346
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:00,540
No, he'd like you to come visit with him.

347
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,375
He's boosting his price.

348
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:06,296
He said he'd like to speak
with whoever is doing the buying.

349
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,716
Well, let him wait. He'll come around.
Let's go.

350
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,725
Ladies and gentlemen?

351
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,728
Ladies and gentlemen.

352
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:25,231
Thank you so much
for visiting with us this evening.

353
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:28,943
Now, l've traveled across half our state
to be here and to see about this land.

354
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,531
Now, I daresay some of you
might have heard

355
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:37,494
some of the more extravagant rumors
about what my plans are,

356
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,371
so I just thought
you'd like to hear it from me.

357
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:43,374
This is the face. It's no great mystery.

358
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:50,215
I'm an oilman, ladies and gentlemen,

359
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,469
l have numerous concerns
spread across this state.

360
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:57,972
I have many wells flowing
at many thousand barrels per day,

361
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,059
so I like to think of myself as an oilman.

362
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,853
As an oilman, I hope that you'll forgive

363
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,856
just good old-fashioned plain speaking.

364
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:12,028
Now, this work that we do
is very much a family enterprise.

365
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,822
I work side by side
with my wonderful son, H.W.

366
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:18,159
I think one or two of you
might have met him already.

367
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:22,038
And I encourage my men
to bring their families, as well.

368
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:26,125
Of course, it makes for an ever
so much more rewarding life for them.

369
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,213
Family means children,
and children means education.

370
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:34,008
So, wherever we set up camp,
education is a necessity,

371
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,344
and we're just so happy
to take care of that.

372
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,846
So let's build a wonderful school
in Little Boston.

373
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,182
These children are the future
that we strive for,

374
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:44,394
and so they should have
the very best of things.

375
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,521
Now, something else,

376
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,483
and please don't be insulted
if l speak about this. Bread.

377
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,610
Let's talk about bread.

378
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,656
Now, to my mind, it's an abomination
to consider

379
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,994
that any man, woman, or child
in this magnificent country of ours

380
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,581
should have to look upon
a loaf of bread as a luxury.

381
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:08,960
We're going to dig water wells here,
and water wells means irrigation.

382
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,462
Irrigation means cultivation.

383
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:15,466
We're going to raise crops here where
before it just simply wasn't possible.

384
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,011
You're going to have more grain
than you'll know what to do with,

385
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,055
and bread will be coming right
out of your ears, ma'am.

386
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:26,477
New roads, agriculture,
employment, education.

387
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,563
These are just a few of the things
we can offer you,

388
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,648
and l assure you,
ladies and gentlemen,

389
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,942
that if we do find oil here,

390
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,487
and l think there's a very good chance
that we will,

391
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:41,117
this community of yours
will not only survive, it will flourish.

392
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,372
l'd be happy to answer any questions
that you might have. Yes?

393
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,000
Will the new road lead to the church?

394
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:53,546
That'll be the first place that it leads.
Thank you, Eli. Anyone else?

395
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,507
Well, if anything comes up,
l'm pretty easy to find.

396
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,884
You just come visit with me.

397
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,053
Thank you so much for your time,
and good night.

398
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:43,554
What a privilege to carry

399
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:47,558
everything to God in prayer!

400
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:52,105
What a privilege to carry...

401
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,290
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

402
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,626
The new road will lead you there.

403
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,420
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

404
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:19,090
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

405
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,925
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

406
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,344
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

407
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,514
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

408
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:38,943
Jesus knows our every weakness

409
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,698
Take it to the Lord in prayer

410
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:49,120
Are we weak and heavy-laden

411
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:53,166
Cumbered with a load of care?

412
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:57,503
Precious Savior still our refuge

413
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,133
Take it to the Lord in prayer...

414
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,190
-Daniel, may l speak with you?
-Yes, come in.

415
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,320
l'll bring them up when they arrive.

416
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,655
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

417
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,699
How is all the work coming?

418
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,242
Everything's good.

419
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,496
-All the men are provided for?
-Of course.

420
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,416
Spirits seem high.

421
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:41,339
ls there anything
that you need from me?

422
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:48,679
-Anything the church can do for you?
-l don't believe so. No. Thank you.

423
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,140
l understand you've asked the people
to gather around

424
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,850
and watch the well begin tomorrow.
ls that right?

425
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,936
-That's right.
-l will bless the well.

426
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,398
Before you begin,
you should introduce me.

427
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,068
You'll see me walk up
towards the oil well, and when l...

428
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,236
The derrick.

429
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,156
You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say my name.

430
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,408
When you walk up?

431
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:13,412
Yes. You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say,

432
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:18,668
"The proud son of these hills
who tended his Father's flock,"

433
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,295
and then you could say my name.

434
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,173
That's fine.

435
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:28,594
-And what happens then?
-Well, then we start the drill.

436
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:35,393
lt's a simple blessing, Daniel,
but an important one.

437
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:38,479
lt's just a few words. lt won't take long.

438
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,692
-What time?
-What time's good for you, Eli?

439
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:45,611
-4:00.
-Well, let's make it 4:00 then.

440
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,449
-My thanks for your visit.
-Good day. Thank you.

441
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,842
Afternoon, everyone.

442
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,803
Come with me.

443
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,645
l thank you all so much
for visiting with us at this time.

444
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,564
l've had the pleasure of
meeting some of you

445
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,524
and l hope very much
in the months to come,

446
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,819
l'll be able to visit with
each and every one of you.

447
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,655
l'm better at digging holes in the
ground than making speeches,

448
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,324
so let's forget the speech
for this evening,

449
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,326
just make it a simple blessing.

450
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,244
You see, one man doesn't prospect
from the ground.

451
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:39,248
lt takes a whole community of
good people, such as yourselves,

452
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,376
and this is good. We stay together.

453
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,253
We pray together, we work together,

454
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,340
and if the Good Lord smiles kindly
on our endeavor,

455
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,926
we share in the wealth together.

456
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,430
Now, before we spud in
Mary's Well Number One,

457
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,683
named for the lovely
Miss Mary Sunday, here by my side,

458
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,811
a proud daughter of these hills,

459
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:04,649
l'd just like to say God bless these
honest labors of ours, and, of course,

460
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,817
God bless you all.

461
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,027
Amen.

462
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,445
Now go.

463
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,202
Won't be a minute.

464
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,207
Fast as you can, H.W.

465
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,879
Are you ready to do this?

466
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,183
That's it, ladies and gentlemen!

467
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:47,149
Al Rose has very generously provided
some refreshments for this occasion

468
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,027
out of his own pocket. Thank you, Al.

469
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:55,199
lf you'll all just care to help yourselves,
l'll be back in a minute.

470
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,690
Mary.

471
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,985
Mary Sunday.

472
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,574
-Do you like your new dress?
-Yes. Thank you.

473
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:21,577
You're welcome. l thought you'd like it.

474
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,997
-Are you happy l came here?
-Yes.

475
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:30,377
Your daddy doesn't hit you anymore,
does he? Does he now?

476
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,130
Better not, right?

477
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,800
l'll take care of you.

478
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:42,014
No more hitting, right?
No more hitting. Now go.

479
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,184
Go and play some more
and don't come back.

480
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,736
Daniel?

481
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:03,577
lt's okay, H.W. Go back to sleep.
Go on. Go back to sleep.

482
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:10,876
Daniel.

483
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:17,842
Daniel!

484
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,218
What?

485
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,222
Lost a man down the well.

486
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,895
-What man?
-Joe Gundha.

487
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,941
-Did l know him?
-No.

488
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,526
What happened?

489
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,577
Pick it up.

490
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,829
Set the brake.

491
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,248
-Tie it down.
-Tie it on.

492
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,212
Shit!

493
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,092
God damn it. Where's the body?

494
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:03,429
-They're fishing it out now.
-All right.

495
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:09,435
-Where's the bit?
-lt's on the deck.

496
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,814
Clean him up. Put some clothes on him.

497
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,192
And...

498
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,403
Set up a tent.

499
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:05,491
Anyone goes down into the cellar,
you tell somebody. Yes?

500
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,493
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

501
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,499
Shut down till midday.

502
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:50,160
And l had a vision.
Yes, last night, l had a vision

503
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:53,205
and l felt God's breath
move through me.

504
00:54:56,793 --> 00:55:00,921
And it rolled down into my stomach.

505
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,800
lt sloshed around.

506
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:10,055
And my stomach spoke in a whisper,
not a shout,

507
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:17,521
"Touch this woman with your hands
and caress her." Yes.

508
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,069
My dear Mrs. Hunter,

509
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,573
you have arthritis, don't you?

510
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,658
-Yes, l do, Eli.
-Yes.

511
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:33,412
The devil is in your hands,
and l will suck it out.

512
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:39,043
Now, l will not cast this ghost out
with a fever

513
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:44,214
for the new spirit inside me has shown
me l have a new way to communicate.

514
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,719
lt is a gentle whisper.

515
00:55:55,060 --> 00:56:02,358
Get out of here, ghost.

516
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,819
Get out.

517
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:14,870
Get out of here, ghost.

518
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:18,874
-...and enter this woman's body now.
-Get out of here, ghost.

519
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:23,837
Get out of here. Don't you dare turn
around and come back.

520
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,715
For if you do,

521
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:32,346
all the armies of my boot
will kick you in the teeth

522
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,974
and you will be cast up
and thrown in the dirt

523
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,477
and thrust back to perdition!

524
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:42,314
And as long as l have teeth,
l will bite you,

525
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:46,402
and if l have no teeth, l will gum you!

526
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:50,239
And as long as l have fists,
l will bash you!

527
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:55,119
Now, get out of here, ghost!
Get out of here, ghost!

528
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:58,288
Get out of here, ghost!

529
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,043
And it left!

530
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,838
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

531
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,800
-Praise the Lord and his holy days!
-Praise God!

532
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:13,345
-Amen! Thank you.
-Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, God.

533
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,807
My dear Mrs. Hunter.

534
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,146
Dance with me.

535
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,697
-Thanks for coming.
-lt was a wonderful sermon.

536
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,199
-Will l see you tomorrow?
-Yes.

537
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,205
Eli.

538
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,544
Had a tragedy at the well last night.

539
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,464
Yes, l heard.

540
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,966
Joe Gundha was a man
of considerable faith.

541
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:55,304
So if you wish to say a few words,
his burial is at noon tomorrow.

542
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:58,265
Daniel, this accident
could have been avoided.

543
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,476
lt is terrible to think of that well

544
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,478
-working away out there...
-These men work in 1 2-hour shifts.

545
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:03,562
-...unblessed.
-They need their rest.

546
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,439
lf they don't have it,
they start to make stupid mistakes.

547
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:08,317
l've seen the men drinking. Don't you
think that has something to do with this?

548
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:09,902
We need these men well-rested
to bring in this well.

549
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,154
They can't get that if they're up here
listening to your gospel,

550
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,406
and then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

551
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,533
l wish l had more time with Joe Gundha.

552
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:17,868
More could have been done.

553
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:22,998
Then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

554
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:31,632
Now, would you see to it
that his personal possessions

555
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,884
find their way
back to his family, please?

556
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,469
Thank you.

557
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:39,139
Heard you were planning
some renovations.

558
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:42,226
Yes, our congregation
is growing strongly.

559
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:47,356
-We need more room.
-That was one goddamn hell of a show.

560
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:51,026
We were happy to have you, Daniel.

561
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,391
Gas, gas, gas!

562
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:58,570
Lights out! Wait here. Wait here.
Lights out!

563
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,499
Put that fire out!

564
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:41,113
ls he hurt? H.W. !
Hand him down to me!

565
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,953
-Hand him down!
-Here.

566
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,167
-Got him?
-l've got him!

567
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:02,843
Oh, God.

568
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,651
Come on.

569
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,373
Open the door.

570
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,932
Let go. There you go. You're safe.
You're safe.

571
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:55,729
You're safe now. l got you here.
You're safe. Let go, son.

572
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:59,983
Tell me where it hurts.
Tell me where it hurts. Tell me where...

573
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,568
-Did you see this?
-No.

574
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:02,736
Tell me where it hurts.

575
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,405
Where does it hurt you?
Where does it hurt you?

576
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:09,201
-l can't hear my voice.
-Were you hit in the head?

577
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:14,414
Were you hit in the head? Tell me!
You have to tell me if you were!

578
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,541
l can't hear my voice.

579
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,261
l have to go and deal with this now.
You wait here for me.

580
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:32,182
You understand? You wait here for me.
l'll be back. l'll be back in a minute.

581
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,475
-Wait here.
-Don't leave!

582
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:37,896
l'm going to take care of you. Wait.
Stay here, son. l'm going to fix this.

583
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,022
-Don't leave!
-You're going to be fine!

584
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,148
Wait for me here!

585
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:43,235
-Hold him down. Hold him down.
-Don't leave!

586
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:48,114
Got to break the cables, Daniel!

587
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:58,250
Get me a hammer!

588
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,546
Here you go.

589
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,197
Get back!

590
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,111
-Michael!
-Sir!

591
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,655
Take Dave and two of the fellas,
pick up some hoses...

592
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,701
Billy, protect the roof.
Don't wait before it gets too hot.

593
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:39,726
What are you looking
so miserable about?

594
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:42,687
There's a whole ocean of oil
under our feet!

595
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:45,523
No one can get at it except for me.

596
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,822
H.W. okay?

597
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,408
No, he isn't.

598
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:40,996
-Where is he?
-Mess room.

599
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:23,848
That's enough now.
That's enough, H.W. That's enough.

600
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:29,521
Do you hear me?
Can you hear me in there?

601
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,028
That's enough.

602
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:52,127
-Grab his legs.
-l have his legs.

603
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,129
-No. Nope.
-No, lad.

604
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,469
Give me that.

605
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:06,766
Steady. That's it.

606
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:09,269
-Easy, boy. Easy.
-Soon be over.

607
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:13,148
Yeah, and that's good.
Now the other side. Turn him over.

608
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:18,069
Almost done.

609
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:23,074
That's it.

610
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:26,744
Come here. lt's over. lt's over.

611
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:35,665
Who do we know in San Francisco

612
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:40,003
or Los Angeles, who could work with...

613
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:46,259
You know, we could...
Someone, a teacher for H.W.

614
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,932
How could you figure out that?

615
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:57,812
Now, call...
God damn it, what's his name?

616
01:11:57,896 --> 01:12:00,231
Bob Brody in San Francisco?

617
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,485
Call Bob Brody
and get someone down here.

618
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:12,994
l'll do it right away.

619
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:22,897
When do we get our money, Daniel?

620
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:32,490
Aren't you a healer?
And a vessel for the Holy Spirit?

621
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:35,618
When are you coming over
and make my son hear again?

622
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:36,869
Can't you do that?

623
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:38,955
lf you had let me bless the well,
this wouldn't have happened.

624
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:41,874
-Daniel.
-You shouldn't have done that.

625
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:47,547
You owe the Church of
the Third Revelation $5,000

626
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:50,508
as part of the arrangement
that we made!

627
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:05,106
Don't even try it, you little runt!
You splash around in here.

628
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:13,865
That's it, that's it.

629
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:28,629
l'm going to bury you underground, Eli.

630
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:35,261
l'm going to bury you underground.

631
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:09,587
You are a stupid man, Abel.

632
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:16,093
You've let someone come in here
and walk all over us.

633
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:22,683
You let him in and do his work here,

634
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:26,812
and you are a stupid man
for what we could have had.

635
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:30,858
l followed His word, Eli. l tried.

636
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,736
You didn't do anything but sit down.

637
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:37,573
You're lazy, and you're stupid.

638
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:45,414
Do you think God is going
to save you for being stupid?

639
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:50,628
He doesn't save stupid people, Abel.

640
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:58,469
l will tear you apart for
what you've done, you stupid man!

641
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,888
How did he come here?
Do you really know? l know!

642
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,641
-Son, don't do this, please!
-Be quiet!

643
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:08,813
Shut your mouth, Abel!
lt was your stupid son!

644
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:12,858
lt was Paul who told him to come here.
l know it.

645
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:14,694
He went to him and he said,

646
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:19,532
"My stupid, weak father
will give away his lots.

647
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:23,119
"Go and take him."
And you let it happen.

648
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:30,793
A stupid father to a stupid son.

649
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,092
Get out of there!

650
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:10,416
Can l help you?

651
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,502
Daniel?

652
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:17,381
-Who's that?
-My name is Henry.

653
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,717
Yeah?

654
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,303
l'm Henry.

655
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,890
What can l do for you?

656
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:32,563
l'm Henry Plainview.
l'm from Fond du Lac.

657
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:38,903
l'm your brother, from another mother.

658
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,074
Ernest is my father.

659
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:48,913
Who are you?

660
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:51,540
Henry.

661
01:18:18,568 --> 01:18:23,072
-Mary Branch? ls that your mother?
-Yes, sir, that's right.

662
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:30,454
l read about your gusher in the paper,
about your success.

663
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:33,624
You heard about my strike?
You just show up?

664
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:36,460
Our father's dead.

665
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:41,298
Ernest died, l heard.
l wanted to find you.

666
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,050
When?

667
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:46,762
Three months ago.
l got a letter from Annabelle.

668
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,640
My sister, Annabelle?

669
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:55,312
-Where is she?
-Still at home. Fond du Lac.

670
01:18:56,982 --> 01:19:00,484
You came all the way
from Wisconsin to tell me this?

671
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:03,654
l'm coming from New Mexico.
l've been there.

672
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,741
l came to find you.

673
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:09,952
Did you know about me?

674
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:20,254
Do you have identification?

675
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:23,007
Do you have this letter?

676
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:48,240
-Where are you coming from?
-From New Mexico.

677
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:50,826
Yes, l know, but from where?

678
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:53,996
Silver City.
l've been there for two years.

679
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:59,877
l was trying drilling of my own for years.

680
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:06,383
-Getting leases in Texas. Louisiana.
-Anything that produced?

681
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:09,512
No. Not like your success, no.

682
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,437
-Are you married?
-No.

683
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:22,942
l spent time in jail.
l had a stretch of very bad time.

684
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:26,821
l had nothing.
l was picked up in Louisiana.

685
01:20:28,281 --> 01:20:31,951
l worked on a chain gang
for six months building roads.

686
01:20:32,452 --> 01:20:35,663
That was a very hard time.

687
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:41,252
Are you married?

688
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:44,922
What were you in jail for?

689
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:49,552
Believe it or not, for all the
terrible things l've gotten myself into,

690
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:53,180
when they picked me up,
l hadn't done anything.

691
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:57,101
But l've done my share of things

692
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:01,814
that shouldn't be talked about.

693
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:27,381
Drink it. Drink it!

694
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,258
Come on.

695
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:44,208
So...

696
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:50,798
What do you want, Henry?

697
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,635
Nothing.

698
01:22:57,722 --> 01:23:01,934
lf you can spare something,
l can work for you in any way.

699
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:06,397
l know l'll keep moving, before long,
to get back to Fond du Lac.

700
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,733
-Do you have any money?
-Some.

701
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,987
-Not much.
-Just answer me directly.

702
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:16,699
You say "nothing," then you say
you'd like to stay and work.

703
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:21,745
And it's better, l'd just like to hear
you say you'd like to be here.

704
01:23:22,872 --> 01:23:24,790
l'd like to be here.

705
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:35,759
l'm a good worker.
l worked cable tool rigs, built railroads.

706
01:23:37,887 --> 01:23:39,930
l won't need any favors.

707
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:46,103
Good.

708
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:14,131
What did my mother know?

709
01:24:16,676 --> 01:24:18,385
l don't know.

710
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:23,474
l don't know if she knew and looked
the other way, if she never knew.

711
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:27,978
Why did you leave?

712
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,900
I know you didn't get on with our father.

713
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:41,825
l worked for Geological Survey
and went to Kansas.

714
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:47,331
l couldn't stay there. l just couldn't.

715
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,585
l don't like to explain myself.

716
01:24:57,592 --> 01:25:01,845
-Are you an angry man, Henry?
-About what?

717
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:06,475
Are you envious? Do you get envious?

718
01:25:07,727 --> 01:25:09,686
l don't think so, no.

719
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:16,527
l have a competition in me.

720
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:20,155
l want no one else to succeed.

721
01:25:25,161 --> 01:25:29,706
-l hate most people.
-That part of me is gone.

722
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:33,794
Working and not succeeding,

723
01:25:33,878 --> 01:25:37,881
all my failures have left me...

724
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:42,803
l just don't care.

725
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:47,099
Well, if it's in me, it's in you.

726
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:54,064
There are times when l look at people
and l see nothing worth liking.

727
01:26:00,029 --> 01:26:04,074
l want to earn enough money
l can get away from everyone.

728
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,582
What will you do about your boy?

729
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:20,966
l don't know.

730
01:26:22,468 --> 01:26:24,928
Maybe it'll change.

731
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:29,516
Does your sound come back to you?
l don't know. Maybe no one knows that.

732
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:33,812
-Doctor might not know that.
-Where's his mother?

733
01:26:39,777 --> 01:26:42,821
l don't want to talk about those things.

734
01:26:46,117 --> 01:26:48,410
l see the worst in people, Henry.

735
01:26:50,413 --> 01:26:54,291
l don't need to look past seeing them
to get all l need.

736
01:26:56,419 --> 01:27:00,422
l've built up my hatreds over the years,
little by little.

737
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:07,471
Having you here
gives me a second breath of life.

738
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,308
l can't keep doing this on my own

739
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:19,650
with these people.

740
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,025
Daniel! Daniel, wake up! Daniel!

741
01:29:44,295 --> 01:29:47,798
Just have to go and have a word
with the conductor.

742
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:50,675
l'll be right back.

743
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:55,514
You stay here. You understand?
You stay here.

744
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:58,433
l'll be right back.

745
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:52,988
No! No!

746
01:30:54,657 --> 01:30:55,907
No!

747
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:07,294
-Tilford!
-Plainview.

748
01:31:07,378 --> 01:31:09,713
This is my brother,
Henry Plainview from Fond du Lac.

749
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:11,465
H.M. Tilford. Pleasure.

750
01:31:11,549 --> 01:31:14,050
Henry Plainview. J.J. Carter.

751
01:31:16,053 --> 01:31:17,471
So...

752
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:19,222
-Shall we?
-Yes.

753
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:29,608
How's your boy?

754
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:33,111
-Thank you for asking.
-ls there anything we can do?

755
01:31:33,237 --> 01:31:35,655
Thanks for asking is enough.

756
01:31:37,283 --> 01:31:39,326
So what are your plans?

757
01:31:41,078 --> 01:31:44,331
ls this about buying up my tracts here?

758
01:31:44,415 --> 01:31:45,499
Yes.

759
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:48,460
The cable was
about my Coyote Hills lease.

760
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:52,756
-We'd like that, too.
-What's your offer on Coyote Hills?

761
01:31:52,882 --> 01:31:57,469
-We'll offer 1 50,000 for full title.
-That's a deal. What's next?

762
01:31:58,262 --> 01:32:02,849
You have 1 1 ,000 acres in Little Boston.
You have one proven well

763
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:04,476
-that was damaged...
-l have three wells proven.

764
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:08,688
You haven't been paying attention.
That's three proven wells.

765
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:14,861
We'll make you a millionaire
while you're sitting here

766
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:17,280
from one minute to the next.

767
01:32:19,116 --> 01:32:21,910
And what else would l do with myself?

768
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:27,999
-Are you asking me?
-What else would l do with myself?

769
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:30,752
Take care of your son.

770
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:34,881
l don't know what you would do.

771
01:32:37,468 --> 01:32:39,970
lf you were me and Standard
offered to buy what you had

772
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:42,764
for a million dollars, why? So, why?

773
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,100
You know why.

774
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:47,060
Yeah, you fellas
should just scratch around in the dirt

775
01:32:47,144 --> 01:32:50,605
and find it like the rest of us, instead of
buying up someone else's hard work.

776
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,649
l've scratched around the dirt, son.

777
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:54,776
You going to change
your shipping costs?

778
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:57,862
We don't dictate shipping costs.
That's railroad business.

779
01:32:58,864 --> 01:33:01,533
You don't own the railroads?

780
01:33:05,496 --> 01:33:08,123
'Course you do. Of course you do.

781
01:33:09,792 --> 01:33:12,252
Where you going to put it all?

782
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:14,713
Where?

783
01:33:16,507 --> 01:33:20,552
Build a pipeline? Make a deal
with Union Oil? Be my guest.

784
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:22,345
But if you can't pull it off,

785
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:26,558
you've got an ocean of oil
under your feet with nowhere to go.

786
01:33:27,518 --> 01:33:32,188
Why not turn it over to us?
We'll make you rich.

787
01:33:32,315 --> 01:33:34,649
You spend time with your boy.

788
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:37,861
lt's a great discovery.

789
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:40,864
Now, let us help you.

790
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:53,209
Did you just tell me
how to run my family?

791
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:55,545
lt might be more important now
that you've proven the field

792
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,547
and we're offering to buy you out.

793
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,883
One night l'm going to come to you,
inside of your house,

794
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:02,969
or wherever you're sleeping,
and l'm going to cut your throat.

795
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:04,220
What?

796
01:34:04,972 --> 01:34:06,264
What are you talking about?
Have you gone crazy?

797
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:07,682
-Did you hear what l said?
-l heard what you said,

798
01:34:07,767 --> 01:34:10,268
-why did you say it?
-You don't tell me about my son.

799
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:12,562
Why are you acting insane
and threatening to cut my throat?

800
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:15,732
-You don't tell me about my son.
-l'm not telling you anything!

801
01:34:15,816 --> 01:34:19,653
l'm asking you to be reasonable.
lf l've offended you, l apologize.

802
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:21,946
You'll see what l can do.

803
01:34:29,789 --> 01:34:34,042
This parcel here is the 3,000-acre
ranch owned by B.L. Harper.

804
01:34:34,126 --> 01:34:36,670
This is San Luis Obispo County land.

805
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:38,630
And from here to the coast,
it's all Union Oil.

806
01:34:38,714 --> 01:34:41,883
What's this? Why don't l own this?

807
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:49,432
-Why don't l own this?
-That's the Bandy tract.

808
01:34:50,184 --> 01:34:53,353
He was the holdout,
when we were doing the buying.

809
01:34:53,437 --> 01:34:55,939
He had hoped to speak with you.

810
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:03,613
Can't you just build the pipeline
around this tract?

811
01:35:06,575 --> 01:35:10,620
Can l build around 50 miles
of Tehachapi mountains?

812
01:35:10,746 --> 01:35:13,289
Don't be thick in front of me, Al.

813
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:17,627
-l can go to him again.
-No, l'll go and talk to the man.

814
01:35:17,753 --> 01:35:20,672
l'll talk to him. Show you how it's done.

815
01:35:24,468 --> 01:35:26,970
All right. Pack it up, Henry.

816
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:41,192
-How big is his room?
-He's sharing with another boy.

817
01:35:41,318 --> 01:35:44,154
-Who?
-An older boy. About 1 2.

818
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:47,323
He's been there for a year.
Named Ballard.

819
01:35:52,496 --> 01:35:56,916
-How big is the room?
-lt's a fair size. Got enough space.

820
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:02,464
Are you taking Henry with you
to meet Union Oil?

821
01:36:15,686 --> 01:36:19,272
-Are you the son of William Bandy?
-Grandson.

822
01:36:19,356 --> 01:36:21,191
-ls he here?
-No, he's out.

823
01:36:21,275 --> 01:36:22,358
Where is he?

824
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:25,361
Told you, he's out.
Now, what do you want?

825
01:36:28,866 --> 01:36:32,786
l'm Daniel Plainview. l want to talk
with him about his property.

826
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:37,791
-About what?
-l believe l'll talk with him about that.

827
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:40,710
-You're that oilman, aren't you?
-That's right.

828
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:42,796
We don't want you drilling out here.

829
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,299
l don't want it either.
Now, when will he be back?

830
01:36:46,383 --> 01:36:47,467
Few days.

831
01:36:47,551 --> 01:36:50,136
Tell him l'd like to speak with him.
Not about drilling.

832
01:36:50,221 --> 01:36:52,514
And l'll be back in a week.

833
01:39:11,528 --> 01:39:13,696
Put that in a glass case.

834
01:39:14,573 --> 01:39:16,491
Here's to Union Oil.

835
01:39:17,159 --> 01:39:18,242
Hundred miles of pipeline,

836
01:39:18,369 --> 01:39:20,787
and all the independent producers
of this great state.

837
01:39:20,871 --> 01:39:21,871
Cheers.

838
01:39:47,064 --> 01:39:49,774
There's that house in Fond du Lac

839
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:54,946
that John Hollister built.
Do you remember it?

840
01:39:57,783 --> 01:40:01,244
l thought as a boy that was
the most beautiful house l'd ever seen,

841
01:40:01,328 --> 01:40:02,996
and l wanted it.

842
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:06,207
l wanted to live in it.

843
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:07,875
And eat in it.

844
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:10,294
And clean it.

845
01:40:13,257 --> 01:40:17,593
And even as a boy, l wanted
to have children to run around in it.

846
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:22,056
You can have
anything you'd like now, Daniel.

847
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:24,392
And you should.

848
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:29,814
-Where are you going to build it?
-Here, maybe. Near the ocean.

849
01:40:32,735 --> 01:40:35,528
Would you make it look like that house?

850
01:40:40,242 --> 01:40:43,745
l think if l saw that house now,
it'd make me sick.

851
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:52,628
We can eat and get some women.

852
01:40:55,591 --> 01:40:57,759
Take them to the Peachtree dance.

853
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:05,433
l say get liquored up and take them
to the Peachtree dance.

854
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:09,520
Yeah.

855
01:42:28,433 --> 01:42:40,736
Can l have some money, please?

856
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:32,288
l want you to tell me something.

857
01:43:35,918 --> 01:43:37,126
What?

858
01:43:38,128 --> 01:43:41,631
What's the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

859
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:57,355
What was the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

860
01:44:00,859 --> 01:44:03,903
-l can't remember...
-Who are you?

861
01:44:06,823 --> 01:44:08,699
l'll leave, Daniel.

862
01:44:10,452 --> 01:44:12,036
Who are you?

863
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:16,916
l'm no one.

864
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:20,253
Just let me get up and go.

865
01:44:22,714 --> 01:44:24,632
Do l have a brother?

866
01:44:28,553 --> 01:44:33,808
l met a man in King City
who said he was your brother.

867
01:44:36,311 --> 01:44:39,438
We were friends for months.

868
01:44:40,857 --> 01:44:42,858
Working in King City.

869
01:44:45,028 --> 01:44:47,989
And he wanted
to make his way to you, Daniel.

870
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,367
We didn't have any money.

871
01:44:56,206 --> 01:44:58,541
He died of tuberculosis.

872
01:44:59,918 --> 01:45:01,794
He wasn't harmed.

873
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:05,047
Wasn't killed, nothing bad.

874
01:45:06,883 --> 01:45:09,135
But he told me about you,

875
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:14,473
and l just took his story,

876
01:45:18,145 --> 01:45:19,979
used his diary.

877
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:24,567
Daniel.

878
01:45:26,194 --> 01:45:29,572
Daniel, l'm your friend.

879
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:34,201
l'm not trying to hurt you.

880
01:45:34,286 --> 01:45:35,578
Never.

881
01:45:36,663 --> 01:45:38,247
Just survive.

882
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:39,999
No!

883
01:48:49,606 --> 01:48:51,106
Who is it?

884
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:53,859
l'm Bandy.

885
01:49:06,623 --> 01:49:08,499
Yes. Yes.

886
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:12,753
William Bandy.

887
01:49:15,924 --> 01:49:18,592
Yeah, l'd like to lease your land.

888
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:24,557
l had asked for you
to come and talk to me before.

889
01:49:24,641 --> 01:49:26,976
When you were leasing land.

890
01:49:28,144 --> 01:49:29,979
That's right, yes.

891
01:49:31,648 --> 01:49:34,233
My boy's been very sick, you know.

892
01:49:35,318 --> 01:49:37,903
This was before your boy got sick.

893
01:49:40,991 --> 01:49:45,536
Now, l know
that you would like to build a pipeline

894
01:49:45,662 --> 01:49:48,330
through my property.

895
01:49:48,415 --> 01:49:52,585
-ls that right, what l've heard?
-lt's absolutely right. And,

896
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:54,253
well...

897
01:49:55,505 --> 01:49:58,841
Eight inch pipe.
lt could be buried with your consent.

898
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:01,510
l guarantee you
absolutely no disruption...

899
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:02,803
God.

900
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:07,266
God has told me what you must do.

901
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:13,355
And what is that?

902
01:50:14,316 --> 01:50:18,235
You should be washed
in the blood of Jesus Christ.

903
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:21,989
But l am.

904
01:50:23,491 --> 01:50:26,201
l have been washed, Mr. Bandy.
l have been.

905
01:50:26,328 --> 01:50:32,041
lt's your only way to salvation.
And your only way for what you want.

906
01:50:33,877 --> 01:50:37,463
You can take it at
the Church of the Third Revelation.

907
01:50:39,883 --> 01:50:41,884
l'll pay you $3,000.

908
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:47,264
l'd like you to be part of our church.

909
01:50:49,142 --> 01:50:51,060
l'll pay you $5,000.

910
01:50:52,145 --> 01:50:53,646
Be baptized.

911
01:50:54,981 --> 01:50:58,859
Be forgiven for the sin that you've done.

912
01:51:03,114 --> 01:51:07,993
What sin are you referring to,
Mr. Bandy?

913
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:11,038
My sin of drilling?

914
01:52:01,756 --> 01:52:05,801
I truly wish everyone could be saved,
don't you?

915
01:52:05,885 --> 01:52:07,803
Yes.

916
01:52:07,887 --> 01:52:10,639
I am afraid that's just not the case.

917
01:52:11,474 --> 01:52:15,978
The doctrine of universal salvation
is a lie, is it not?

918
01:52:16,104 --> 01:52:18,731
-lt's a lie.
-lt's a lie.

919
01:52:18,815 --> 01:52:23,652
l wish everyone could be saved,
but they won't. No, they won't.

920
01:52:23,737 --> 01:52:27,239
You will never be saved if you...

921
01:52:27,323 --> 01:52:29,324
Reject the blood.

922
01:52:30,118 --> 01:52:31,326
Good.

923
01:52:32,328 --> 01:52:36,832
Now, is there a sinner here
looking for salvation?

924
01:52:39,502 --> 01:52:41,128
A new member?

925
01:52:45,550 --> 01:52:47,342
l'll ask it again.

926
01:52:49,345 --> 01:52:52,055
ls there a sinner here looking for God?

927
01:52:52,182 --> 01:52:53,348
Yes.

928
01:52:57,437 --> 01:52:58,896
Allow me.

929
01:53:01,107 --> 01:53:03,901
Thank you for coming, brother Daniel.

930
01:53:06,029 --> 01:53:07,696
Thank you, Eli.

931
01:53:08,782 --> 01:53:13,911
We have a sinner with us here
who wishes for salvation!

932
01:53:13,995 --> 01:53:17,623
-Daniel, are you a sinner?
-Yes.

933
01:53:17,707 --> 01:53:20,417
The Lord can't hear you, Daniel.

934
01:53:20,502 --> 01:53:24,379
Say it to him. Go ahead
and speak to him. lt's all right.

935
01:53:25,131 --> 01:53:27,466
-Yes.
-Down on your knees.

936
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:29,134
Pray to him.

937
01:53:30,512 --> 01:53:34,890
Look up to the sky and say it.

938
01:53:37,477 --> 01:53:39,686
What do you want me to say?

939
01:53:40,688 --> 01:53:45,192
Daniel, you've come here and
you've brought good and wealth,

940
01:53:45,276 --> 01:53:49,488
but you have also brought
your bad habits as a backslider.

941
01:53:49,572 --> 01:53:53,867
You've lusted after women,
and you have abandoned your child.

942
01:53:53,952 --> 01:53:57,037
Your child, that you raised,
you have abandoned

943
01:53:57,121 --> 01:53:59,581
all because he was sick
and you have sinned.

944
01:53:59,707 --> 01:54:01,875
So say it now. l am a sinner.

945
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:03,877
-l am a sinner.
-Say it louder.

946
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:06,755
-l am a sinner.
-l am a sinner.

947
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,757
Louder, Daniel! l am a sinner!

948
01:54:08,883 --> 01:54:11,844
-l am a sinner.
-l am sorry, Lord.

949
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:14,096
-l am sorry, Lord.
-l want the blood.

950
01:54:14,222 --> 01:54:17,599
-l want the blood.
-You have abandoned your child.

951
01:54:18,351 --> 01:54:19,685
l have abandoned my child.

952
01:54:19,769 --> 01:54:22,104
-l will never backslide.
-l will never backslide.

953
01:54:22,230 --> 01:54:25,274
l was lost, but now l am found.

954
01:54:25,358 --> 01:54:29,278
-l was lost, but now l'm found.
-l have abandoned my child.

955
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:34,199
Say it. Say it.

956
01:54:34,284 --> 01:54:37,369
-l abandoned my child.
-Say it louder. Say it louder!

957
01:54:37,453 --> 01:54:43,000
l've abandoned my child!

958
01:54:43,126 --> 01:54:45,127
l've abandoned my boy!

959
01:54:45,253 --> 01:54:47,671
Now beg for the blood!

960
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:50,716
Just give me the blood, Eli.
Let me get out of here.

961
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:53,594
Give me the blood, Lord,
and let me get away!

962
01:54:53,678 --> 01:54:57,472
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and Savior?

963
01:54:57,599 --> 01:55:00,350
-Yes, l do.
-Get out of here, devil!

964
01:55:00,476 --> 01:55:03,312
Out, devil! Out, sin!

965
01:55:03,438 --> 01:55:05,981
-Let me feel the power of the Lord, Eli.
-Do you accept

966
01:55:06,107 --> 01:55:09,985
the Church of the Third Revelation
as your spiritual guide?

967
01:55:11,487 --> 01:55:15,741
-Get out of here, ghost!
-Where is your Lord, Eli?

968
01:55:15,825 --> 01:55:19,953
-Get out! Go back where you belong!
-Where is he? There he is!

969
01:55:20,038 --> 01:55:23,665
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Savior?

970
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:25,208
Yes, l do.

971
01:55:27,962 --> 01:55:32,299
Would you be free
from the burden of sin?

972
01:55:32,383 --> 01:55:34,760
There's power in the blood

973
01:55:34,844 --> 01:55:36,929
Power in the blood

974
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:38,972
Would you o'er evil a victory win?

975
01:55:39,057 --> 01:55:41,308
There's a pipeline.

976
01:55:41,392 --> 01:55:45,604
There's wonderful power in the blood

977
01:55:45,688 --> 01:55:50,108
There is power, power
wonder-working power

978
01:55:50,193 --> 01:55:53,904
ln the blood of the Lamb

979
01:55:53,988 --> 01:55:55,781
Praise the Lord!

980
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:03,246
Welcome to the fold, brother Plainview.

981
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:16,885
Welcome, brother Daniel.
God bless you.

982
01:56:18,096 --> 01:56:19,554
God bless you.

983
01:56:22,725 --> 01:56:24,393
-Hallelujah.
-Amen.

984
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:26,770
Welcome home, brother.

985
01:56:27,397 --> 01:56:30,899
That's enough. That's enough, now.

986
01:56:33,069 --> 01:56:37,280
He must take the spirit in on his own.

987
01:56:40,034 --> 01:56:41,910
We have a new member.

988
01:56:42,036 --> 01:56:44,162
-Yes, brother.
-Hallelujah.

989
01:56:44,247 --> 01:56:46,248
-Hallelujah.
-Amen.

990
01:56:48,418 --> 01:56:50,502
-My sweet Mary.
-Mr. Plainview has been generous

991
01:56:50,586 --> 01:56:53,380
enough to make a $5,000 donation

992
01:56:53,464 --> 01:56:56,550
to the church
which we are still waiting for.

993
01:58:08,623 --> 01:58:11,958
That does me good.
That does me good.

994
01:58:14,003 --> 01:58:20,509
Welcome home, son.

995
01:58:24,388 --> 01:58:26,473
This here's George Reynolds.
Teacher from the deaf school.

996
01:58:26,557 --> 01:58:29,601
-Mr. Plainview.
-Fletcher.

997
01:58:32,355 --> 01:58:34,523
You're too heavy for me.

998
01:58:37,527 --> 01:58:40,278
Do you want to get something to eat?

999
01:58:41,447 --> 01:58:45,784
That's the pipeline, see?
All the way to the sea.

1000
01:59:06,848 --> 01:59:08,431
Come here.

1001
01:59:15,273 --> 01:59:17,065
l love you, son.

1002
01:59:18,985 --> 01:59:21,153
Let's take a look at you.

1003
01:59:23,406 --> 01:59:26,283
All right. That's it, that's it. That's it.

1004
01:59:50,308 --> 01:59:53,643
Let's get some decent food
inside of you.

1005
01:59:53,728 --> 01:59:57,564
That's all we need here
is a good, strong, expensive meal.

1006
01:59:58,149 --> 01:59:59,691
You hungry?

1007
02:00:00,735 --> 02:00:01,860
-Waiter?
-Yes, sir.

1008
02:00:01,944 --> 02:00:04,988
Two steaks, a whiskey,
and water for him.

1009
02:00:06,574 --> 02:00:09,117
-And goat's milk.
-Very good, sir.

1010
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:18,877
We're going to have
this teacher help you.

1011
02:00:19,420 --> 02:00:23,965
He's going to help take care
of all of this. Understand?

1012
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:26,801
'Cause l need you. Need your help.

1013
02:00:26,886 --> 02:00:30,889
Got everything we need now
to build this company. Come here.

1014
02:00:38,648 --> 02:00:40,398
Good afternoon.

1015
02:00:56,499 --> 02:00:58,583
-How are you doing?
-lt's nice to see you again.

1016
02:00:58,668 --> 02:01:01,503
-We need four.
-l'll have them right up.

1017
02:01:05,633 --> 02:01:07,634
-Good afternoon, Daniel.
-Tilford.

1018
02:01:07,718 --> 02:01:09,135
Good afternoon.

1019
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:15,976
-Hello! H.M. Tilford!
-You don't have to shout.

1020
02:01:17,979 --> 02:01:19,396
Pleasure.

1021
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:26,403
lt's good to be in Little B.

1022
02:01:27,655 --> 02:01:30,991
-Could use some rain out here.
-Yeah, we could.

1023
02:01:31,826 --> 02:01:34,953
-There we go.
-R.J., how's the London broil?

1024
02:01:35,037 --> 02:01:37,747
Believe we ordered these drinks
before those people.

1025
02:01:37,832 --> 02:01:42,127
-R.J., tell us. How's the London broil?
-Excuse me, gentlemen. Sorry.

1026
02:01:44,171 --> 02:01:48,133
l am sorry about that, sir.
l'll have your steaks right out.

1027
02:01:57,935 --> 02:02:00,562
-So that green turtle soup is fantastic.
-ls it?

1028
02:02:00,646 --> 02:02:02,314
lt's delicious.

1029
02:02:07,278 --> 02:02:08,278
Sounds good to me.

1030
02:02:08,404 --> 02:02:14,159
So Standard offered us a million
dollars for the Little Boston leases.

1031
02:02:14,243 --> 02:02:17,162
l told H.M. Tilford
where he could shove that.

1032
02:02:17,246 --> 02:02:21,916
And we made a deal with Union!
On the pipeline!

1033
02:02:22,001 --> 02:02:25,503
And that whole ocean of oil
underneath our fields.

1034
02:02:25,588 --> 02:02:27,255
-...$1 50,000.
-Yes.

1035
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:29,674
We needed the money to drill.

1036
02:02:29,759 --> 02:02:32,010
-Who is this guy?
-l go out to meet him.

1037
02:02:32,094 --> 02:02:34,929
He's getting oil on the property.
We're trying to make a claim on it.

1038
02:02:35,014 --> 02:02:36,931
Offered him a million dollars.

1039
02:02:37,058 --> 02:02:40,268
-Turned us down flat.
-Well, l'm hungry.

1040
02:02:40,394 --> 02:02:45,023
Orange fritters,
mashed potatoes, green peas.

1041
02:02:45,107 --> 02:02:47,609
-All the way around?
-All right.

1042
02:02:50,488 --> 02:02:51,905
Hold on.

1043
02:02:55,618 --> 02:02:57,911
I want you to look over there.

1044
02:02:57,995 --> 02:03:00,830
-Daniel, let me introduce...
-Look over there. You see?

1045
02:03:00,956 --> 02:03:03,041
That's my son. See him?

1046
02:03:03,125 --> 02:03:05,460
-Yes.
-Do you see?

1047
02:03:07,797 --> 02:03:09,255
I see him.

1048
02:03:10,091 --> 02:03:12,967
You don't tell me
how to raise my family.

1049
02:03:15,096 --> 02:03:18,681
I told you not to tell me
how to raise my family.

1050
02:03:20,142 --> 02:03:22,018
Daniel...

1051
02:03:22,812 --> 02:03:24,687
So what do you see?

1052
02:03:26,649 --> 02:03:29,859
-I'm very happy for you that the deal...
-Yes, I made a deal with Union.

1053
02:03:29,944 --> 02:03:32,320
-My son is happy. He's safe.
-Congratulations.

1054
02:03:32,405 --> 02:03:35,615
-I'm taking care of him now, so...
-Excellent.

1055
02:03:36,867 --> 02:03:39,911
You look like a fool, don't you, Tilford?

1056
02:03:44,542 --> 02:03:47,419
-Yes.
-Yes.

1057
02:03:49,213 --> 02:03:50,922
Yes, you do.

1058
02:03:51,799 --> 02:03:53,299
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1059
02:03:53,592 --> 02:03:56,845
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse him, gentlemen.

1060
02:04:00,349 --> 02:04:03,017
I told you what I was going to do.

1061
02:04:13,279 --> 02:04:14,529
My son.

1062
02:04:32,590 --> 02:04:35,925
Mr. Sunday, I understand
that you're leaving our fair community.

1063
02:04:36,051 --> 02:04:39,179
-Yes, I'm going on a mission.
-Where you going?

1064
02:04:39,263 --> 02:04:41,473
Oildale, Taft,
and then on to Bakersfield.

1065
02:04:41,557 --> 02:04:43,933
Well, I want you to know...

1066
02:04:44,059 --> 02:04:45,935
Three quarters of an hour.

1067
02:04:46,061 --> 02:04:47,604
...you done a great job for us.

1068
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:50,607
-Thank you. You will be in my prayers.
-I thank you very much.

1069
02:04:50,691 --> 02:04:53,985
Union Oil Company,
Santa Paula, California.

1070
02:07:02,948 --> 02:07:06,784
"The woman saith unto him,
'Sir, give me this water

1071
02:07:07,786 --> 02:07:12,790
"'and I shall thirst not,
neither come hither to draw."'

1072
02:08:54,268 --> 02:08:55,977
Come in, come in.

1073
02:09:22,671 --> 02:09:24,922
Can we be alone?

1074
02:09:25,007 --> 02:09:28,760
This is my closest associate.
He hears everything.

1075
02:09:35,809 --> 02:09:40,897
-I'd prefer to speak to you in private.
-You can't speak.

1076
02:09:40,981 --> 02:09:43,191
So why don't you flap your hands about

1077
02:09:43,275 --> 02:09:46,861
and have what's-his-name tell me
where you've been.

1078
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:57,622
Or do you think I don't know?

1079
02:10:12,054 --> 02:10:14,347
This is hard for me to say.

1080
02:10:15,390 --> 02:10:19,560
I'll tell you first, I love you very much.

1081
02:10:22,815 --> 02:10:26,859
I've learned to love what I do
because of you.

1082
02:10:30,239 --> 02:10:32,156
I'm leaving here.

1083
02:10:33,575 --> 02:10:35,910
I'm going to Mexico.

1084
02:10:36,036 --> 02:10:39,038
I'm taking Mary,
and I'm going to Mexico.

1085
02:10:40,666 --> 02:10:42,792
I miss working outside.

1086
02:10:43,794 --> 02:10:45,711
I miss the fields.

1087
02:10:48,632 --> 02:10:50,800
It'll only be for a time,

1088
02:10:51,969 --> 02:10:54,303
for me to do my own drilling

1089
02:10:56,014 --> 02:10:58,182
and start my own company.

1090
02:11:01,144 --> 02:11:05,648
It's time to make a change.

1091
02:11:18,662 --> 02:11:21,205
This makes you my competitor.

1092
02:11:25,127 --> 02:11:30,298
-No. No, it's not like that.
-It is like that, boy.

1093
02:11:31,466 --> 02:11:33,467
Your own company, huh?

1094
02:11:33,886 --> 02:11:35,428
That's right.

1095
02:11:37,723 --> 02:11:39,515
In Mexico?

1096
02:11:40,976 --> 02:11:42,059
Yes.

1097
02:11:42,144 --> 02:11:47,231
You are making such a misstep.
So, what are you doing?

1098
02:11:49,234 --> 02:11:52,612
I know you and I
have disagreed over many things.

1099
02:11:53,488 --> 02:11:57,867
I'd rather keep you as my father
than my partner.

1100
02:11:57,951 --> 02:11:59,452
Then say it.

1101
02:11:59,536 --> 02:12:01,287
If you've got something to say to me,
then say it.

1102
02:12:01,371 --> 02:12:05,041
I'd like to hear you speak
instead of your little dog.

1103
02:12:23,143 --> 02:12:25,853
I'm going to Mexico with my wife.

1104
02:12:26,813 --> 02:12:28,981
I'm going away from you.

1105
02:12:34,988 --> 02:12:37,698
That wasn't so hard, was it?

1106
02:12:39,576 --> 02:12:42,244
Killing us with what you're doing.

1107
02:12:45,123 --> 02:12:48,626
You're killing my image of you
as my son.

1108
02:12:48,710 --> 02:12:52,129
You are stubborn. You won't listen.

1109
02:12:52,214 --> 02:12:54,548
You're not my son.

1110
02:12:54,633 --> 02:12:57,843
Please don't say that.
I know you don't mean it.

1111
02:12:57,928 --> 02:13:01,931
It's the truth. You're not my son.
You never have been.

1112
02:13:03,266 --> 02:13:05,101
You're an orphan!

1113
02:13:07,813 --> 02:13:10,064
Did you ever hear that word?

1114
02:13:11,566 --> 02:13:13,484
Tell him what I said.

1115
02:13:14,236 --> 02:13:17,196
You operated here today like one.

1116
02:13:18,782 --> 02:13:21,283
I should have seen this coming.

1117
02:13:22,744 --> 02:13:27,623
I should have known that,
under this all, these past years

1118
02:13:27,749 --> 02:13:31,127
you've been building new hate for me,
piece by piece.

1119
02:13:31,253 --> 02:13:34,880
I don't even know who you are
because you have none of me in you.

1120
02:13:34,965 --> 02:13:37,883
You're someone else's.

1121
02:13:39,261 --> 02:13:42,763
This anger. Your maliciousness.

1122
02:13:43,849 --> 02:13:46,767
Backwards dealings with me.

1123
02:13:48,437 --> 02:13:52,440
You're an orphan from a basket
in the middle of the desert.

1124
02:13:55,193 --> 02:14:00,197
And I took you for no other reason
than I needed a sweet face to buy land.

1125
02:14:01,658 --> 02:14:03,451
Did you get that?

1126
02:14:04,661 --> 02:14:06,454
So now you know.

1127
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:14,128
Look at me!
You're lower than a bastard.

1128
02:14:38,987 --> 02:14:43,491
You have none of me in you.
You're just a bastard from a basket.

1129
02:14:53,168 --> 02:14:57,463
I thank God I have none of you in me.

1130
02:15:02,344 --> 02:15:06,847
Not my son.
Just a little piece of competition.

1131
02:15:08,683 --> 02:15:10,851
Bastard from a basket.

1132
02:15:13,188 --> 02:15:15,439
Bastard from a basket!

1133
02:15:23,824 --> 02:15:26,367
You're a bastard from a basket!

1134
02:16:28,889 --> 02:16:30,723
Get up, Mr. Daniel.

1135
02:16:35,061 --> 02:16:36,645
Mr. Daniel.

1136
02:16:38,607 --> 02:16:41,192
Mr. Daniel, you've got a visitor.

1137
02:16:44,821 --> 02:16:46,697
Wake up, Mr. Daniel.

1138
02:16:49,409 --> 02:16:50,993
Sir?

1139
02:17:04,466 --> 02:17:06,467
You can leave us now.

1140
02:17:14,726 --> 02:17:20,272
Daniel.

1141
02:17:22,817 --> 02:17:26,070
Daniel Plainview, the house is on fire!

1142
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:33,744
Brother Daniel, it's Eli.

1143
02:17:43,964 --> 02:17:47,716
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

1144
02:17:49,803 --> 02:17:51,762
I'll make us a drink.

1145
02:17:58,311 --> 02:18:01,522
Your home is a miracle.

1146
02:18:02,691 --> 02:18:04,358
It's beautiful.

1147
02:18:04,985 --> 02:18:07,069
God bless it.

1148
02:18:07,195 --> 02:18:11,198
I've been spreading His word
far and wide.

1149
02:18:12,450 --> 02:18:14,285
Far and wide.

1150
02:18:16,037 --> 02:18:18,872
So much travel for Him.

1151
02:18:23,545 --> 02:18:25,963
I've been working in radio.

1152
02:18:28,633 --> 02:18:32,636
Yes, so much...
So much has been happening.

1153
02:18:33,638 --> 02:18:39,184
To be here and find you
and see you well is wonderful.

1154
02:18:39,269 --> 02:18:41,895
And we have a chance to catch up.

1155
02:18:54,993 --> 02:18:57,077
No. Thank you so much.

1156
02:19:15,138 --> 02:19:16,722
My brother.

1157
02:19:18,099 --> 02:19:21,393
Daniel, my brother by marriage.

1158
02:19:23,355 --> 02:19:27,483
We're such old friends. So much time.

1159
02:19:33,948 --> 02:19:37,076
Things go up, things go down,

1160
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:41,497
but at least the Lord is always around.

1161
02:19:43,083 --> 02:19:45,793
We've seen ups and downs,
haven't we?

1162
02:19:49,589 --> 02:19:52,591
Are things down for you right now, Eli?

1163
02:19:53,927 --> 02:19:55,344
No. No.

1164
02:19:57,764 --> 02:20:00,432
But I do come with some sad news.

1165
02:20:02,143 --> 02:20:04,895
Perhaps you remember Mr. Bandy?

1166
02:20:07,482 --> 02:20:10,859
Mr. Bandy has passed on to the Lord.

1167
02:20:11,778 --> 02:20:14,947
He lived to be 99 years old,
God bless him.

1168
02:20:15,615 --> 02:20:19,493
Mr. Bandy has a grandson.
Have you met his grandson, William?

1169
02:20:20,495 --> 02:20:25,082
William Bandy is one of
the finest members we have

1170
02:20:25,166 --> 02:20:27,751
at the Church of the Third Revelation.

1171
02:20:27,836 --> 02:20:31,171
He's eager to come to Hollywood
to be in movies.

1172
02:20:32,632 --> 02:20:34,842
He is very good-looking.

1173
02:20:37,011 --> 02:20:42,015
-And I do think he will have success.
-That's wonderful.

1174
02:20:44,144 --> 02:20:46,937
Would you like me to speak with him?

1175
02:20:54,362 --> 02:20:59,116
Daniel, I'm asking
if you'd like to have business

1176
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:01,452
with the Church of the Third Revelation

1177
02:21:01,536 --> 02:21:05,831
in developing this lease
on young Bandy's 1,000-acre tract.

1178
02:21:08,251 --> 02:21:09,877
I'm offering you to drill

1179
02:21:10,003 --> 02:21:13,464
on one of the great undeveloped fields
of Little Boston.

1180
02:21:13,548 --> 02:21:17,718
-I'd be happy to work with you.
-You would?

1181
02:21:19,262 --> 02:21:22,139
Yes, yes, of course. That's wonderful.

1182
02:21:22,223 --> 02:21:25,225
But there is one condition for this work.

1183
02:21:25,310 --> 02:21:26,852
All right.

1184
02:21:28,897 --> 02:21:32,441
I'd like you to tell me
that you are a false prophet.

1185
02:21:37,780 --> 02:21:43,243
I'd like you to tell me that you are,
and have been a false prophet.

1186
02:21:44,412 --> 02:21:46,788
And that God is a superstition.

1187
02:21:52,879 --> 02:21:54,713
But that's a lie.

1188
02:21:57,467 --> 02:22:00,093
It's a lie. I cannot say it.

1189
02:22:14,317 --> 02:22:16,735
-When can we begin to drill?
-Very soon.

1190
02:22:16,819 --> 02:22:18,445
How long will it take
to bring in the well?

1191
02:22:18,571 --> 02:22:20,489
lt shouldn't take long.

1192
02:22:20,615 --> 02:22:23,867
I would like a $100,000 signing bonus,

1193
02:22:23,952 --> 02:22:27,287
plus the five that is owed to me
with interest.

1194
02:22:27,956 --> 02:22:29,748
That's only fair.

1195
02:22:35,463 --> 02:22:40,300
I am a false prophet,
and God is a superstition.

1196
02:22:40,385 --> 02:22:43,387
If that's what you believe,
then I will say it.

1197
02:22:43,471 --> 02:22:46,974
-Say it like you mean it.
-Daniel.

1198
02:22:47,475 --> 02:22:49,851
Say it like it's your sermon.

1199
02:22:52,981 --> 02:22:54,648
Don't smile.

1200
02:23:00,405 --> 02:23:02,322
I am a false prophet.

1201
02:23:02,407 --> 02:23:05,826
-God is a superstition.
-Why don't you stand up?

1202
02:23:08,830 --> 02:23:10,872
Put your glass down.

1203
02:23:23,011 --> 02:23:26,597
I am a false prophet.

1204
02:23:26,681 --> 02:23:29,766
-God is a superstition.
-Eli, stop.

1205
02:23:29,851 --> 02:23:35,314
Just imagine this is your church here
and you have a full congregation, so...

1206
02:23:37,817 --> 02:23:41,612
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1207
02:23:41,696 --> 02:23:43,322
Say it again.

1208
02:23:44,365 --> 02:23:48,243
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1209
02:23:48,328 --> 02:23:49,494
They can't hear you at the back.

1210
02:23:49,579 --> 02:23:52,998
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1211
02:23:53,082 --> 02:23:54,166
Say it again.

1212
02:23:54,250 --> 02:23:58,920
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1213
02:23:59,005 --> 02:24:00,714
Say it again.

1214
02:24:00,798 --> 02:24:04,551
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1215
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:08,096
Those areas have been drilled.

1216
02:24:11,225 --> 02:24:12,643
What?

1217
02:24:12,727 --> 02:24:15,395
Those areas, they've been drilled.

1218
02:24:16,939 --> 02:24:20,484
-No, they haven't.
-Yes, it's...

1219
02:24:20,568 --> 02:24:21,943
lt's called drainage, Eli.

1220
02:24:22,070 --> 02:24:26,907
See, I own everything around it, so,
of course, l get what's underneath it.

1221
02:24:28,326 --> 02:24:31,536
But there are no derricks there.

1222
02:24:31,621 --> 02:24:34,039
This is the Bandy tract.
Do you understand?

1223
02:24:34,123 --> 02:24:36,124
Do you understand, Eli?

1224
02:24:36,834 --> 02:24:40,087
That's more to the point.
Do you understand?

1225
02:24:40,171 --> 02:24:45,592
I drink your water. I drink it up every day.

1226
02:24:46,594 --> 02:24:50,847
I drink the blood of Lamb
from Bandy's tract.

1227
02:24:56,104 --> 02:24:58,230
You can sit down again.

1228
02:25:16,332 --> 02:25:22,003
Daniel.

1229
02:25:25,842 --> 02:25:27,175
Please.

1230
02:25:29,804 --> 02:25:34,141
-I am in desperate times.
-I know.

1231
02:25:34,225 --> 02:25:37,102
-I need a friend.
-Yes. Of course, you do.

1232
02:25:37,478 --> 02:25:39,104
I've sinned.

1233
02:25:40,815 --> 02:25:43,984
I need help. I'm a sinner.

1234
02:25:44,068 --> 02:25:48,697
I've let the devil grab hold of me
in ways I never imagined.

1235
02:25:48,781 --> 02:25:50,240
I'm so full of sin.

1236
02:25:50,324 --> 02:25:53,618
The Lord sometimes challenges us,
doesn't He, Eli?

1237
02:25:53,703 --> 02:25:55,704
-Yes, He does, Daniel.
-Yes, He does.

1238
02:25:55,788 --> 02:26:00,459
Yes, He does!

1239
02:26:01,711 --> 02:26:07,299
He's completely failed to alert me
to the recent panic in our economy.

1240
02:26:07,383 --> 02:26:09,593
-And this...
-Oh, dear.

1241
02:26:09,677 --> 02:26:16,391
I must have this, Daniel.
I must, I must, I must have this.

1242
02:26:16,517 --> 02:26:18,769
My investments have...

1243
02:26:18,853 --> 02:26:23,940
Daniel, I won't bore you, but if I could
grab the Lord's hand for help I would,

1244
02:26:24,025 --> 02:26:26,943
but He does these things all the time.

1245
02:26:27,028 --> 02:26:31,031
These mysteries that He presents,
and while we wait...

1246
02:26:32,283 --> 02:26:34,493
While we wait for His word!

1247
02:26:34,577 --> 02:26:37,579
Because you're not
the chosen brother, Eli.

1248
02:26:39,957 --> 02:26:43,794
'Twas Paul who was chosen.

1249
02:26:44,629 --> 02:26:47,589
He found me and told me
about your land. You're just a fool.

1250
02:26:47,715 --> 02:26:50,550
-Why are you talking about Paul?
-I did what your brother couldn't.

1251
02:26:50,635 --> 02:26:53,220
-Don't say this to me.
-I broke you and l beat you.

1252
02:26:54,055 --> 02:26:56,890
It was Paul told me about you.

1253
02:26:57,016 --> 02:27:01,478
He's the prophet. He's the smart one.
He knew what was there

1254
02:27:01,562 --> 02:27:03,980
and he found me to take it
out of the ground.

1255
02:27:04,065 --> 02:27:07,192
Know what the funny thing is?
Listen, listen.

1256
02:27:08,027 --> 02:27:11,947
I paid him $10,000 cash in hand.
Just like that.

1257
02:27:12,949 --> 02:27:16,326
He has his own company now.
Prosperous little business.

1258
02:27:16,410 --> 02:27:19,955
Three wells producing, $5,000 a week.

1259
02:27:21,999 --> 02:27:25,836
Stop crying, you sniveling ass.
Stop your nonsense.

1260
02:27:27,004 --> 02:27:30,882
-You're just the afterbirth, Eli.
-No.

1261
02:27:30,967 --> 02:27:33,635
That slithered out on your mother's filth.

1262
02:27:33,761 --> 02:27:35,095
No.

1263
02:27:35,179 --> 02:27:39,432
They should've put you in a glass jar
on the mantelpiece.

1264
02:27:41,102 --> 02:27:44,479
Where were you when Paul
was suckling at his mother's teat?

1265
02:27:44,605 --> 02:27:46,106
Where were you?

1266
02:27:46,232 --> 02:27:50,944
Who was nursing you, poor Eli?
One of Bandy's sows?

1267
02:27:51,070 --> 02:27:53,989
That land has been had.
Nothing you can do about it. It's gone.

1268
02:27:54,073 --> 02:27:56,283
-If you would just take this lease...
-You lose.

1269
02:27:56,367 --> 02:27:59,619
Drainage!

1270
02:28:00,621 --> 02:28:04,249
Drainage, Eli, you boy.

1271
02:28:05,334 --> 02:28:08,295
Drained dry. I'm so sorry.

1272
02:28:09,463 --> 02:28:11,631
If you have a milkshake

1273
02:28:12,675 --> 02:28:14,467
and I have a milkshake,

1274
02:28:14,552 --> 02:28:17,762
and I have a straw, there it is.
That's the straw, you see?

1275
02:28:17,847 --> 02:28:19,472
Watch it.

1276
02:28:20,850 --> 02:28:27,814
Now my straw reaches across the room

1277
02:28:29,066 --> 02:28:31,902
and starts to drink your milkshake.

1278
02:28:32,820 --> 02:28:36,656
I drink your milkshake!

1279
02:28:38,826 --> 02:28:42,329
-I drink it up!
-Don't bully me, Daniel.

1280
02:28:44,999 --> 02:28:50,253
Did you think your song and dance and
your superstition would help you, Eli?

1281
02:28:50,338 --> 02:28:55,008
I am the Third Revelation.
I am who the Lord has chosen.

1282
02:28:57,178 --> 02:28:59,512
-Daniel!
-Because I'm smarter than you!

1283
02:28:59,597 --> 02:29:01,097
I'm older!

1284
02:29:01,891 --> 02:29:03,725
I'm your old friend, Daniel!

1285
02:29:03,809 --> 02:29:06,269
-I'm not a false prophet...
-Help me! Help me!

1286
02:29:06,354 --> 02:29:08,605
...you sniveling boy!

1287
02:29:08,689 --> 02:29:15,403
I am the Third Revelation!
I am the Third Revelation!

1288
02:29:15,488 --> 02:29:18,490
-I told you I would eat you.
-We're family!

1289
02:29:18,574 --> 02:29:23,036
-I told you I would eat you up!
-We're brothers! We're brothers!

1290
02:29:30,127 --> 02:29:32,963
Daniel, please forgive me. l beg you.

1291
02:29:36,592 --> 02:29:38,718
That's it. That's it.

1292
02:30:41,073 --> 02:30:42,574
Mr. Daniel?

1293
02:30:50,458 --> 02:30:52,167
I'm finished.
