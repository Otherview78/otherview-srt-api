1
00:00:57,518 --> 00:00:58,852
<i>Are you watching closely?</i>

2
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:10,197
<i>Every magic trick
consists of three parts or acts.</i>

3
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:13,742
<i>The first part is called the Pledge.</i>

4
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:17,162
<i>The magician shows you
something ordinary...</i>

5
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:20,666
<i>...a deck of cards, a bird, or a man.</i>

6
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:29,717
<i>He shows you this object...</i>

7
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:31,885
<i>...perhaps he asks you to inspect it...</i>

8
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:35,681
<i>...to see that it is, indeed, real.</i>

9
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:38,976
<i>Yeah, unaltered, normal.</i>

10
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:45,190
<i>But of course, it probably isn't.</i>

11
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:49,445
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

12
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,877
<i>The second act is called the Turn.</i>

13
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,311
<i>The magician takes
the ordinary something...</i>

14
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:27,107
<i>...and makes it
do something extraordinary.</i>

15
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:35,491
<i>Now, you're looking for the secret,
but you won't find it...</i>

16
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:38,952
<i>...because, of course,
you're not really looking.</i>

17
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,246
<i>You don't really wanna know.</i>

18
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,835
<i>You want to be fooled.</i>

19
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:50,464
<i>But you wouldn't clap yet...</i>

20
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:55,260
<i>...because making something
disappear isn't enough.</i>

21
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:59,181
<i>You have to bring it back.</i>

22
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:04,186
<i>That's why every magic trick
has a third act.</i>

23
00:03:04,353 --> 00:03:05,938
<i>The hardest part.</i>

24
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,942
<i>The part we call the Prestige.</i>

25
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:23,038
<i>The Prestige. And did Robert Angier...</i>

26
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:24,832
...the Great Danton, your employer...

27
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:27,668
...get to that final part
of his trick that night?

28
00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:30,629
- No, sir. Something went wrong.
- What went wrong?

29
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:34,299
I saw someone
making their way below stage.

30
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:36,176
I followed him.

31
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:39,596
It was Borden,
watching Mr. Angier drown.

32
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:43,016
Would you please describe
your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter?

33
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:44,268
I'm an <i>ingénieur.</i>

34
00:03:44,435 --> 00:03:48,772
I design illusions and construct the
apparatus necessary for performing them.

35
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:49,982
So, Mr. Cutter...

36
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:53,318
...was this water-filled tank
beneath the stage...

37
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:55,237
...part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

38
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:56,530
No, no. It was--

39
00:03:56,697 --> 00:04:00,868
The tank was brought on for the first
trick and then taken off-stage.

40
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:04,204
Borden must have placed it
under the trap door after the interval.

41
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:05,789
How large was this tank?

42
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:10,544
Oh, it's a normal tank for escape
underwater, about 4 or 500 gallons.

43
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:12,087
How do you think Mr. Borden...

44
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:15,716
...was able to move the tank under
the trap door without anyone noticing?

45
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:17,676
He's a magician. Ask him.

46
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:20,512
I ask again that this man explain...

47
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:22,389
...the mechanics of Mr. Angier's illusion.

48
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:24,057
The Real Transported Man...

49
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:27,227
...is one of the most sought-after
illusions in this business.

50
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:28,896
I have the right to sell it on.

51
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:31,648
If I reveal the method here,
then the trick is worthless.

52
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:35,861
How can we know that the tank wasn't
some part of the trick that went wrong?

53
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:38,697
Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament...

54
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:41,116
...but Alfred Borden's life
hangs in the balance.

55
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:44,411
If you were prepared to disclose
the details to me in private...

56
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:47,164
...I might be able to judge
their relevance to the case.

57
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:49,917
Might this be
an acceptable compromise?

58
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:11,522
I'm gonna have to ask you
to turn out your pockets.

59
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:17,110
Not my idea, sir.

60
00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:19,530
The warden saw his show
in Manchester last year...

61
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:21,281
...where he vanished into thin air.

62
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:24,409
He's convinced he'll try and escape.

63
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:30,082
I told him the only way
that Borden's gonna disappear...

64
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:33,418
...is if I leave him out there
with the other inmates.

65
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:39,758
Check the locks.

66
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:43,595
Twice.

67
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:52,646
My name is Owens.

68
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:54,982
I'm a solicitor.

69
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:58,819
I represent Lord Caldlow, accomplished
amateur magician and historian--

70
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:00,696
How much?

71
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:03,865
- Lord Caldlow is interested--
- How much for my tricks?

72
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:05,325
Five thousand pounds.

73
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:07,995
Talk with Fallon, my <i>ingénieur.</i>
Money's for him.

74
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:11,832
Yes, I did.
He offered to sell me your tricks.

75
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:14,710
All except the most valuable one:
The Transported Man.

76
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:18,046
Well, I wouldn't forgive myself
for selling my greatest trick.

77
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:19,506
Even for your daughter?

78
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:23,885
If the newspapers are right
and you are for the drop...

79
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:27,431
- ...your daughter will need looking after.
- Fallon will take care of her.

80
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:31,018
Bernard Fallon? A man with a past
almost as obscure as your own.

81
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:33,812
Courts motioned that the girl
be removed from his care.

82
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:36,398
No, the girl will be an orphan.

83
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:41,445
I know you're no stranger to
the workhouse. It's better than here?

84
00:06:41,612 --> 00:06:44,656
I'm offering you a way
to wrap up your affairs with dignity.

85
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:46,700
And I'm offering your daughter
a future.

86
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:50,495
As Lord Caldlow's ward,
she will want for nothing. Ever.

87
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,583
Well, think it over.

88
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:59,713
And Lord Caldlow would like you
to have this as a show of good faith.

89
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,258
He said it might be of interest.
This is Robert Angier's diary.

90
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:06,178
Including the time he spent
in Colorado learning your trick.

91
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:07,888
- He never learned my trick.
- Really?

92
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:11,558
On his return from Colorado, he mounted
a version of The Transported Man...

93
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:15,562
...that the papers said
was better even than your original.

94
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:22,110
If you want Angier's secrets,
you go dig him up and ask him yourself.

95
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:25,238
I want your secret, Mr. Borden.

96
00:07:27,574 --> 00:07:28,742
Consider your daughter.

97
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:40,295
<i>A cipher. An enigma.</i>

98
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:46,843
<i>A search. A search for answers.</i>

99
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:56,561
<i>Even if Colorado
is the end of my journey...</i>

100
00:07:56,728 --> 00:08:02,442
<i>...it'll take much longer to unravel
the rest of Borden's secrets.</i>

101
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:08,615
<i>See, the cipher in his notebook
is unlocked by a single word...</i>

102
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:14,579
<i>...but it will still take months to translate
his writing and to know his mind.</i>

103
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:20,752
<i>Well, my passion is equal to the task.</i>

104
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:36,601
Mr. Angier?
Welcome to Colorado Springs.

105
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:55,203
- The whole town has electricity.
- Yes, sir.

106
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:14,931
Well, quite a reception.

107
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:17,476
You're our first guest of the season,
Mr. Angier.

108
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:21,021
Your telegram didn't indicate
how long you'll be staying with us.

109
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:22,689
For as long as it takes.

110
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:26,026
I'll need a coach tomorrow
to take me up the mountain.

111
00:09:26,193 --> 00:09:29,738
Well, the peak is closed, sir,
for scientific experimentation.

112
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:33,158
Yes, I know. That's why I'm here.

113
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:42,334
Whoa, whoa.

114
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:47,756
You'll have to walk the rest,
I'm afraid, sir.

115
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:19,704
Ah!

116
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:28,630
I'm amazed how many of you
newspaper writers can't read my sign.

117
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:35,554
Not the welcome I was expecting.

118
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:40,559
I know you.

119
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:49,109
You're the Great Danton.
I saw your show in London seven times.

120
00:10:49,276 --> 00:10:53,572
You guessed every object
the audience had in their pockets.

121
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:55,115
I'm Alley.

122
00:10:55,282 --> 00:10:57,742
Sorry about the fence.
People interfere with our work.

123
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:00,453
- I've come to see Tesla.
- Why?

124
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,457
He made a machine
for a colleague of mine some time ago.

125
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:08,128
- Can you get me a meeting with him?
- Impossible, I'm afraid.

126
00:11:08,295 --> 00:11:10,463
I brought a lot of money.

127
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,173
I'm sorry, Mr. Angier.

128
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:16,219
I simply can't help you.

129
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:20,682
I'll be staying at the hotel.
Indefinitely.

130
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,769
Hey, what am I holding?

131
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:26,938
Your watch.

132
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:35,155
<i>Borden's journal entry
for April 3rd, 1897...</i>

133
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:37,449
<i>...describes a show
at the Orpheum Theater.</i>

134
00:11:37,616 --> 00:11:41,453
<i>That was just days
after he first met me.</i>

135
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:46,499
<i>We were two young men
at the start of a great career.</i>

136
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,169
<i>Two young men devoted to an illusion.</i>

137
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:51,504
<i>Two young men
who never intended to hurt anyone.</i>

138
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:56,176
Which of you brave souls is
willing to bind this lovely young woman?

139
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,856
if you would tie her wrists.

140
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:15,487
Bind her feet around the ankle.

141
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:17,656
Are either of you
two gentlemen sailors?

142
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:19,532
- No.
- No.

143
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:23,828
I'm sure you can both
tie a strong knot.

144
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:53,828
<b>Subtitle

145
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:30,186
He's complacent,
he's predictable, he's boring.

146
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:32,939
I mean, Milton has gotten success,
whatever that means...

147
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:35,900
...and now he's scared.
He won't take any risks at all.

148
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,778
I mean, he's squandering
the goodwill of the audience...

149
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:41,906
- ...with tired, second-rate tricks.
- They're old favorites.

150
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:45,452
Favorites? Give me something fresh.
He won't even try a bullet catch.

151
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,203
A bullet catch is suicide.

152
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,291
All it takes is some smart-ass volunteer
to put a button in the barrel.

153
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,793
- Fine. Use a plant.
- You can't for every trick.

154
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,796
- There'd be no seats left for the punters.
- No bullet catch.

155
00:13:56,963 --> 00:14:01,301
But the point is that a real magician
tries to invent something new...

156
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:04,262
...that other magicians
are gonna scratch their heads over.

157
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:06,598
And then you sell it to him
for a small fortune.

158
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:07,807
- All right.
- Yeah.

159
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:09,768
I suppose you have such a trick.

160
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:12,353
- Actually, I do.
- Would you care to sell it to me?

161
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,064
No.
No one else could do my trick.

162
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,274
- Any trick can be duplicated, right?
- Wrong.

163
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:19,319
If Mr. Borden
has invented his masterpiece...

164
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:21,654
...it might be only he's
prepared to do it.

165
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,199
Milton is a great showman,
but Borden is right.

166
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:25,950
He won't get his hands dirty.

167
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:30,497
If you wanna see what it takes
to make real magic, go to the Tenley.

168
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:33,374
There's a Chinaman there,
and he really has what it takes.

169
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,794
- Chung Ling Soo.
- Pricey. I can't afford that.

170
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,504
I know the bloke on the door.

171
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,006
You two go and see that show...

172
00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:42,050
...and whichever one of you
can tell me...

173
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:44,094
...how he does
the goldfish-bowl trick...

174
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,553
- ...gets a prize.
- All right.

175
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,388
- Which is?
- Ten minutes on-stage...

176
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:49,349
...with my old friend Mr. Ackerman.

177
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:50,850
- Really?
- Who's Ackerman?

178
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:53,144
The top theatrical agent in London.

179
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:56,231
I saw you drop the knot again.

180
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:59,734
- I think I turned my wrist.
- Some nights you don't get it, do you?

181
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:03,863
I mean, if that knot slips and
Julia's on the hoist, she'll break a leg.

182
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:08,368
It's the wrong knot. Like I said,
the Langford double will hold tighter.

183
00:15:08,535 --> 00:15:12,163
The Langford double isn't a wet knot.
It's too dangerous.

184
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,415
If the rope swells up, she won't slip it.

185
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:17,710
- I can slip a Langford underwater.
- She can slip it. We'll practice.

186
00:15:17,877 --> 00:15:19,212
Hey, Borden, he said no.

187
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:21,714
Yeah, well, you know knots
better than me, do you?

188
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:23,800
Listen, no more mistakes.

189
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,553
All right. Yeah, do you?
You wanna take over?

190
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,556
- Just leave it.
- I didn't think so.

191
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:36,604
- Hey, Cutter, where's he from?
- Where are you from?

192
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:41,067
- He shifts props for Virgil at the hall.
- Don't you worry he'll steal your tricks?

193
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:43,528
- He doesn't deal in methods.
- How do you know?

194
00:15:43,695 --> 00:15:48,783
Because I hired him to find out
how Virgil does the orange trick.

195
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,286
- Well, I don't trust him.
- He's a natural magician.

196
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:52,912
Of course you can't trust him.

197
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:54,789
I think he's all right.

198
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:57,292
- You think everyone's all right.
- Even you.

199
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:01,171
Watch your sight lines. If I can see you
kissing your wife's leg every night...

200
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:03,882
...so can the blokes
at the ends of row three and four.

201
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,458
<i>- You're wrong. It can't be.</i>
<i>- No, it is.</i>

202
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:42,086
- Look at the man.
- This is the trick.

203
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:44,380
This is a performance right here.

204
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:46,799
This is why no one
can detect his method.

205
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:50,136
Total devotion to his art.

206
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:55,308
Utter self-sacrifice, you know?

207
00:16:55,475 --> 00:17:01,105
It's the only way to escape all this,
you know.

208
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:04,275
All right.

209
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:08,363
I can barely lift this thing
and it's not even filled with water.

210
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:12,033
Or fish. Look.

211
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,327
I don't know. Hang on a second.

212
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,457
He must be strong as an ox.

213
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:24,545
He's been pretending
to be a cripple for years.

214
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:28,174
Any time he's in public. Any time
he goes out. It's unthinkable.

215
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:31,302
Borden saw it at once,
but I couldn't fathom it.

216
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:34,055
Living my whole life
pretending to be someone else.

217
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:37,892
- You're pretending to be someone else.
- I don't think changing a name compares.

218
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,520
Not just your name.
Who you are and where you're from.

219
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:41,896
I promised my family...

220
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:44,941
...I wouldn't embarrass them
with my theatrical endeavors.

221
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:48,361
I thought of a name for you.

222
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:51,739
The Great Danton.

223
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:54,367
Do you like it?

224
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:57,704
- But it's sophisticated.
- It's French.

225
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:07,880
<i>Borden writes as if no one but
he understood the true nature of magic.</i>

226
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:16,556
<i>But what does he know
of self-sacrifice?</i>

227
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:23,563
You bloody fool.

228
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,509
- He killed it.
- What?

229
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:54,719
What's wrong?

230
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:58,931
- He killed it.
- I'm sure he didn't.

231
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:04,354
See? Look, now
he'll bring it back.

232
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:09,442
No, he killed it.

233
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:11,778
No.

234
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,787
Look. See?
He's all right. He's fine.

235
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:24,957
- Look at him.
- But where's his brother?

236
00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:30,880
He's a sharp lad, your son.

237
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:33,633
Oh, he's my nephew.

238
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,176
Oh.

239
00:19:39,472 --> 00:19:40,932
You're the lucky one today.

240
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:03,830
Are you watching closely?

241
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,001
Look closer.

242
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:13,840
Never show anyone.

243
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:18,636
They'll beg you and flatter you for the
secret, but as soon as you give it up...

244
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:20,263
...you'll be nothing to them.

245
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,640
You understand? Nothing.

246
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:25,685
The secret impresses no one.

247
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:29,355
The trick you use it for is everything.

248
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,156
- Well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden.
- You're welcome.

249
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:42,869
- Alfred. It's Alfred.
- Alfred.

250
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:45,872
So I could use a cup of tea.

251
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:50,376
I'd scandalize the landlord. I think not.

252
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:54,005
You think that's--?
Is that enough to keep me out?

253
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:57,383
I think so.

254
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:00,178
So I'll see you again?

255
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:10,813
Milk and sugar?

256
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,881
- What's in there?
- Angier's machine.

257
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:47,016
You built this, Mr. Cutter?

258
00:21:47,183 --> 00:21:49,977
Oh, no, sir.
This wasn't built by a magician.

259
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:52,104
This was built by a wizard.

260
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:56,901
A man who can actually do
what magicians pretend to do.

261
00:21:57,068 --> 00:22:01,447
Tell me, Your Honor, what happens
with these things after the trial?

262
00:22:01,614 --> 00:22:03,324
They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.

263
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:06,285
An avid collector,
apparently very interested in the case.

264
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:08,913
Yeah, well, don't let him take this.

265
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,831
- Why ever not?
- It's too dangerous.

266
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:16,420
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles
it's got a simple and disappointing trick.

267
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:19,465
Most disappointing of all, sir...

268
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:23,010
...it has no trick.

269
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:26,764
It's real.

270
00:22:29,976 --> 00:22:32,144
This is the tank Angier drowned in?

271
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:34,313
Yes.

272
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,943
This is the place where the
performer's hand reaches through...

273
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,820
...to the trick padlock.

274
00:22:40,987 --> 00:22:43,322
A standard magical apparatus
for escapes.

275
00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:45,866
Yeah, with one important difference:

276
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,952
This isn't a trick lock.

277
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,037
It's been switched for a real one.

278
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:52,123
What a way to kill someone.

279
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:56,127
They're magicians, Your Honor.
Showmen.

280
00:22:56,294 --> 00:23:00,339
Men who live by dressing up plain
and sometimes brutal truths...

281
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,384
...to amaze, to shock.

282
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:05,928
Even without an audience?

283
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:08,806
There was an audience.

284
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:11,851
You see, this water tank...

285
00:23:12,018 --> 00:23:16,188
...was of particular significance
to these two men.

286
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:20,568
Particularly awful significance.

287
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:27,033
Which of you brave souls is
willing to bind this lovely young woman?

288
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:30,911
If you would tie her wrists.

289
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:33,247
Bind her feet around the ankle.

290
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:48,512
Are either of you two
gentlemen sailors?

291
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:49,722
No.

292
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:54,101
I'm sure you can both
tie a strong knot.

293
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:49,615
Robert!

294
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:12,513
No! No! No!

295
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:17,143
Julia. Julia.

296
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,770
Julia! Julia!

297
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:07,234
I knew an old sailor once.

298
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:12,406
He told me he went overboard,
tangled in the sails.

299
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:18,204
They pulled him out,
but it took him five minutes to cough.

300
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:22,333
He said it was like going home.

301
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:29,924
What do you want, Borden?

302
00:26:36,806 --> 00:26:38,766
I'm sorry for your loss, Angier.

303
00:26:42,645 --> 00:26:44,939
Which knot did you tie?

304
00:26:47,817 --> 00:26:49,360
I keep asking myself that.

305
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:53,572
- And?
- And...

306
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,409
I'm sorry, I just don't know.

307
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:01,038
You don't know?

308
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:04,542
I'm sorry.

309
00:27:05,793 --> 00:27:07,628
You don't know?

310
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:14,093
You don't know?

311
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:21,725
Alfred?

312
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:24,186
Good news.
We got our first booking today.

313
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:27,314
- I don't think we've had the pleasure.
- Mr. Fallon is my <i>ingénieur.</i>

314
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:30,943
- Where did you get all of--?
- Begged, borrowed, and don't ask.

315
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:35,239
He's a very enterprising soul,
is Mr. Fallon.

316
00:27:35,406 --> 00:27:36,866
- So--
- We can't afford to pay him.

317
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:38,826
Money will come
when we get the audience.

318
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:42,454
But what about until then? I mean,
what I earn, it's barely enough for us.

319
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:45,791
Don't worry about it. I'll share
half my food with him or something.

320
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,587
You're already going to be doing that
with someone else.

321
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,841
- No. You're--?
- Having a baby.

322
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:57,803
Oh, my God.
We should have told Fallon.

323
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,763
That is great. We're having a baby.

324
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,974
- We're having a baby.
- Oh, come here.

325
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:06,937
Alfred, what's this?

326
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:11,150
Oh, this is just the trick to wake
Ackerman up at the end of my act.

327
00:28:11,317 --> 00:28:13,944
Is it the masterpiece? The great trick?

328
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:16,655
No, no, no. The world is not ready
for that one yet.

329
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:21,160
This is just your run-of-the-mill,
daring, spectacular bullet catch.

330
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:26,123
- A bullet catch?
- Yeah, but it's safe, I promise. Look.

331
00:28:28,626 --> 00:28:30,794
- Shoot me.
- Shoot you?

332
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:32,004
Go on, shoot me.

333
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:36,634
- Right there.
- No, I can't.

334
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,219
No, no, not there.
Shoot me here. Don't--

335
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:48,020
- How's that?
- That's very good.

336
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:50,856
- Go on, tell me how you do it.
- No, I can't do that.

337
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,945
- Well, then you can't do it. Alfred--
- I can't do it?

338
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:59,323
I'm sorry, Alfred,
but I can't raise a child on my own.

339
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:03,202
- You don't tell anybody that I told you.
- Okay.

340
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:05,079
Gunpowder...

341
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:07,748
...wadding...

342
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,251
...and a bullet.

343
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:13,671
A ramrod.

344
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,593
Hold out your hand.

345
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:26,558
The bullet is not even in the gun
when the charge is fired.

346
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:30,396
Once you know,
it's actually very obvious.

347
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:33,440
Well, I mean, you still get--

348
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:36,568
It's dangerous. I mean,
people still get killed doing that.

349
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:37,945
- Well, how?
- Well, you know.

350
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:41,073
Somebody could get a smart-ass.
He can put a penny or a button...

351
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,201
...or may God forbid, Sarah,
somebody could put a bullet there.

352
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:46,787
Don't worry. Don't worry...

353
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:50,249
...because I'm not gonna let
anything happen.

354
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:52,001
Everything's gonna be all right...

355
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:58,340
...because I love you very much.

356
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,762
- Say it again.
- I love you.

357
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:07,266
- Not today.
- What?

358
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:10,561
Well, on some days it's not true,
and today you don't mean it.

359
00:30:10,728 --> 00:30:13,814
Maybe today you're more
in love with magic than me.

360
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:16,316
I like being able to tell the difference.

361
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:21,405
It makes the days it is true
mean something.

362
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:25,159
All right.

363
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:47,139
Metal rings, ladies and gentlemen.

364
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:50,100
If there are any
ladies or gentlemen here.

365
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:53,437
- Solid metal.
- Seen that already.

366
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:56,148
- Leave it out!
- Come on.

367
00:31:00,486 --> 00:31:03,363
Get out your gun, mate.

368
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:06,116
- Who threw that?
- I did!

369
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:14,708
Get out your gun.
You're gonna need it.

370
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:20,172
Get a gun.

371
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:24,051
It's what you came for, is it?

372
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:31,517
So who wants to volunteer?

373
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:34,520
Me! Me!

374
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:45,864
Me.

375
00:31:46,949 --> 00:31:48,408
Watch it, cowboy.

376
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:02,172
Are you man enough, sir?

377
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:08,846
Yes.

378
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:21,859
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

379
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:30,284
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

380
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:33,203
I don't know.

381
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:41,962
Ah!

382
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:52,431
<i>He came in to demand
an answer, and I told him the truth.</i>

383
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:55,601
<i>That I have fought with myself
over that night.</i>

384
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:59,229
<i>One half of me swearing blind
that I tied a simple slipknot...</i>

385
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:02,608
<i>...the other half convinced
that I tied the Langford double.</i>

386
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:04,985
<i>I can never know for sure.</i>

387
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:09,781
How can he not know?

388
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:12,284
<i>How can he not know?</i>

389
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:17,247
<i>He must know what he did. He must.</i>

390
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,919
Sarah, that bloody hurts.

391
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:25,255
I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

392
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:27,758
It's as bad as the day it happened.

393
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:33,513
- We have to get a doctor back.
- We can't afford the bloody doctor back.

394
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,726
- You've woken her.
- Great.

395
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:41,313
I'm sorry. I need this to heal
so I can go back to work.

396
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,192
Alfred, face things. What tricks
can you perform with this kind of injury?

397
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,862
I can do card pulls.
I can do some prop tricks.

398
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:53,325
I can still do that. And I can do the
trick that I've been telling you about.

399
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:55,494
The one that they're gonna
remember me for.

400
00:33:57,996 --> 00:33:59,748
Come on.

401
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:28,318
Never thought I'd find an answer
at the bottom of a glass.

402
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:30,028
Hasn't stopped you looking.

403
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,493
Heard about a booking.

404
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,289
Nice little theater.
Young, up-and-coming magician.

405
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:41,873
- Who?
- You.

406
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,709
You got me a booking? Why?

407
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,794
I wanna keep on working.

408
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:49,006
And who's gonna hire the <i>ingénieur</i>
that killed Julia McCullough...

409
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:51,383
...in front of a sellout crowd
at the Orpheum?

410
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:54,386
Someone who knows
it wasn't your fault.

411
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:57,931
Someone who knows Alfred Borden
and his repertoire of exotic knots.

412
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:01,560
I hear he had a spot of bad luck
catching a bullet south of the river.

413
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:04,146
That's a dangerous trick, that one.

414
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,611
We'll have to whitewash the windows...

415
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:15,741
...confound the more curious members
of the public, but it will do.

416
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,746
- We should see about an assistant.
- I've made some arrangements.

417
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,333
Have you settled on a name?

418
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:27,919
Yes, I have. The Great Danton.

419
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:30,589
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

420
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,259
No, it's sophisticated.

421
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:36,845
The birdcage can't be
our climax. Everybody knows it.

422
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:39,556
- Not like this, they don't.
- I don't wanna kill doves.

423
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:43,268
Then stay off the stage.
You're a magician, not a wizard.

424
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:47,272
You gotta get your hands dirty
if you're gonna achieve the impossible.

425
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:51,068
In here, Miss Wenscombe.

426
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:54,613
No point in you meeting Mr. Angier
if you don't fit.

427
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,740
On the right.

428
00:35:58,784 --> 00:35:59,993
What's so hard about this?

429
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,413
Nothing. But you're going down here.

430
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:09,127
Hold it. Hold it there.
This has gotta go around there.

431
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:11,380
- And this will conceal it?
- Yeah, oh, sure.

432
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:12,631
- All right?
- Yeah.

433
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:15,425
- Now, take that one there.
- Yep. Okay.

434
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:18,053
- Pin this under.
- And this ties up here?

435
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,013
- That ties at the front.
- That's good.

436
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:28,980
Breathe as little as possible.

437
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:37,489
Now, you see? That'll go.
That'll flatten.

438
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:38,949
- I see. Yeah.
- Okay.

439
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:46,331
She's not experienced,
but she knows how to present herself.

440
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:50,752
A pretty assistant is the most
effective form of misdirection.

441
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:52,295
Thank you.

442
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:54,464
Ladies and gentlemen,
for my final trick...

443
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:57,300
...I will require the assistance
of two volunteers.

444
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:59,803
Mr. Merrit, if you would oblige me?

445
00:37:01,596 --> 00:37:04,766
Yeah. Okay. Bring your hand around.

446
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:06,518
- Under?
- Under, yeah.

447
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:09,479
There. I put it around its foot.

448
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,481
- Careful.
- He's all right, ain't he?

449
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:34,713
- You get a volunteer to put a hand there.
- Yeah.

450
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,922
And another one there.

451
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:39,718
Mr. Merrit, if you'll place your hands
on either side of the cage, please.

452
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:40,927
Thank you, Olivia.

453
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:42,888
You best not be intending...

454
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:45,557
- ...to hurt this animal, Mr. Angier.
- Of course not.

455
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:47,934
You ready? All right.

456
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:49,686
One...

457
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:51,354
Two...

458
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:53,732
- Three.
- Three. Go.

459
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,570
Well, that's bloody marvelous,
Cutter.

460
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:00,780
Very nice.

461
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:03,074
And the best part is...

462
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:10,499
I thought you said
I had to get my hands dirty.

463
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:14,085
Someday perhaps you will.
I just had to know that you can.

464
00:38:14,252 --> 00:38:16,963
- Very nice. Very nice, indeed.
- Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

465
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,966
I haven't had the chance
to compliment your beautiful theater.

466
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:22,469
Well, it'll be a lot more beautiful
when it's full.

467
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:24,471
- Don't worry.
- Oh, you all say that.

468
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:28,433
Why should I worry? If your tricks
don't get them in, somebody else's will.

469
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,771
Maybe somebody willing to do
a bullet catch or a water escape?

470
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:34,314
Cheap thrills, Mr. Merrit.

471
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:38,109
People hoping for an accident,
likely to see one too.

472
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:40,820
What would that do for your business?

473
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,241
- You got a week, John.
- Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

474
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:56,628
Thank you.

475
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:01,299
Sir? In the third row there.

476
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:04,302
Please stand up
and show us your handkerchief.

477
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:07,931
This isn't mine.

478
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:11,184
Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it
to the lady in the aisle.

479
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:12,644
I believe she has yours.

480
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:17,857
Thank you.

481
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:22,445
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm making so many mistakes.

482
00:39:22,612 --> 00:39:24,447
I'm so nervous.

483
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:27,158
The audience doesn't seem
to be responding.

484
00:39:27,325 --> 00:39:32,122
They've seen a lot of tricks before,
but not this next one.

485
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,091
Put a cloth over.

486
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:46,052
- Fingers crossed.
- I'll have the champagne ready.

487
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:04,362
- You've seen this one before?
- We've seen them all.

488
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:06,948
I'll make it a little harder then, shall I?

489
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:12,537
Two volunteers, please. A lady and
a gentleman to hold this cage with me.

490
00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:16,916
I'll perform this feat in a manner
never before seen by yourselves...

491
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,919
...or any other audience
anywhere in the world.

492
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:25,300
Madam, if you'll place one hand
on the back of the cage...

493
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:26,635
...one hand on the front.

494
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:30,680
Sir, one hand on the bottom
of the cage, one hand on the top.

495
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:40,023
Ah!

496
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:46,863
- Should have spotted him.
- You had a lot of plates going.

497
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,282
- Don't suppose they'll let us do it again.
- No.

498
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:53,244
- What's the climax of our show?
- Show? You don't have a show.

499
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:55,038
We have a week's engagement.

500
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:58,833
To perform magic, not butcher birds
and break my customers' fingers.

501
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,419
Clear out. Anything here
in the morning gets burned.

502
00:41:01,586 --> 00:41:03,922
- Mr. Merrit--
- It's done, John.

503
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:07,759
I've hired a comedian.
You know I hate comedians.

504
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,429
Well, there's plenty of good theaters.

505
00:41:11,596 --> 00:41:15,600
If we can come up with a new trick,
change the name of the act--

506
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,644
The name stays.

507
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:24,609
Right. Well, then the new trick's
gonna have to be irresistible, then.

508
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:26,569
I have a couple of methods to try out.

509
00:41:26,736 --> 00:41:30,031
And then we need a new angle
on the presentation.

510
00:41:30,198 --> 00:41:31,991
Oh, and if you need some inspiration...

511
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:35,161
...there's a technical exposition
at the Albert Hall this week.

512
00:41:35,328 --> 00:41:37,997
Engineers, scientists, you know?

513
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:41,334
That sort of thing
captures a public's imagination.

514
00:41:58,476 --> 00:42:01,813
Mind if I join you? Tesla sends me
down here during the storms.

515
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,108
Perfect excuse to come join
the Great Danton for a drink.

516
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:08,111
Two of them.

517
00:42:08,653 --> 00:42:11,156
Beautiful, isn't it, huh?
God, I miss New York though.

518
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:13,700
- So why are you here?
- The lightning lives here.

519
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:16,995
And not much else.
Our work is secret.

520
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:19,497
Is that a cipher?

521
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:24,669
It's a rotating transposition
that shifts every day of the diary.

522
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:26,588
Simple, but time-consuming
to translate...

523
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:28,715
...even when you have
the five-letter keyword.

524
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:30,633
Which is?

525
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,677
We magicians have a circle of trust.

526
00:42:32,844 --> 00:42:36,806
You have a circle of trust
with someone whose diary you stole?

527
00:42:36,973 --> 00:42:38,016
Maybe I bought it.

528
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,519
And you're hoping to find
a great secret in there.

529
00:42:41,686 --> 00:42:45,356
I've already found it.
That's why I'm here.

530
00:42:51,696 --> 00:42:54,657
Tesla built one for another magician.

531
00:42:54,824 --> 00:42:58,077
- Why would you want the same thing?
- Call it a professional rivalry.

532
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,957
Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines
for unusual people.

533
00:43:03,124 --> 00:43:04,667
But he would never talk about it.

534
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:07,754
I understand discretion.
I just want the machine.

535
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:12,967
Finish your drink.

536
00:43:13,968 --> 00:43:15,303
I wanna show you something.

537
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,723
I think you'll have a special
appreciation for our work.

538
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,268
- I thought it was a secret.
- You're a magician.

539
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:24,103
Who's gonna believe you?

540
00:43:25,396 --> 00:43:27,440
Not long now.

541
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:30,026
Our equipment requires
a great deal of current.

542
00:43:30,193 --> 00:43:31,820
Tesla electrified the whole town...

543
00:43:31,986 --> 00:43:34,614
...in exchange for using
the generators when we need to.

544
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:39,285
We do our tests
when the townspeople are asleep.

545
00:43:39,452 --> 00:43:42,080
Mr. Tesla doesn't wanna scare anyone.

546
00:44:00,056 --> 00:44:01,933
Where are the wires?

547
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:04,602
Exactly.

548
00:44:13,903 --> 00:44:17,991
- Where's the generator?
- You saw it last week.

549
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:21,119
- That must be 10 miles from here.
- Fifteen.

550
00:44:21,286 --> 00:44:24,581
And I have to ride all of them
before I get to bed.

551
00:44:25,456 --> 00:44:28,084
I'll send word for you
in a few days, Mr. Angier.

552
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:32,297
<i>Magic. Real magic.</i>

553
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:36,426
Now appearing only here
at London's Royal Albert Hall.

554
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:38,803
One of the miracles of our age.

555
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,097
A technological marvel.

556
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:43,474
You've never seen anything like it
in your lives.

557
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:46,019
Your eyes will not believe
what they're witnessing.

558
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:49,272
The miracle of Nikola Tesla,
ladies and gentlemen.

559
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:51,816
Free, clean power.
Would you like to know the future?

560
00:44:51,983 --> 00:44:54,319
The man speaking now
is going to change the world.

561
00:44:54,485 --> 00:44:59,324
Ladies and gentlemen, come one,
come all. Immediate seating, no waiting.

562
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:17,759
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry...

563
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:19,677
...but objections have been raised...

564
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:23,222
- ...concerning the safety...
- Does that look safe to you?

565
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:25,808
Part of Thomas Edison's
smear campaign...

566
00:45:25,975 --> 00:45:29,854
...against Mr. Tesla's
superior alternating current.

567
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:31,564
Mr. Alley, please.

568
00:45:31,731 --> 00:45:34,233
We have asked Mr. Tesla
to reconsider...

569
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,028
- Which he will not.
- ...his presentation.

570
00:45:37,195 --> 00:45:41,407
But I've been told he refuses
to appear under any such restrictions.

571
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:44,869
Clear the hall!
This thing is gonna blow!

572
00:45:45,036 --> 00:45:47,664
- Clear the hall!
- Ladies and gentlemen, please!

573
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:50,375
Where's the switch?

574
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:56,547
This is all perfectly safe.

575
00:46:27,495 --> 00:46:28,538
Hey.

576
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:30,248
Hello, you.

577
00:46:30,415 --> 00:46:33,209
Hello, Jess.

578
00:46:35,586 --> 00:46:38,381
Have you had a nice day with Mummy?

579
00:46:40,466 --> 00:46:43,594
Sarah, I love you.

580
00:46:43,761 --> 00:46:47,140
- See? Today it's true.
- Yeah.

581
00:46:47,306 --> 00:46:48,975
Hello.

582
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:52,311
<i>I saw happiness.</i>

583
00:46:52,645 --> 00:46:55,606
<i>Happiness that should have been mine.</i>

584
00:46:55,773 --> 00:46:57,108
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

585
00:46:57,275 --> 00:47:01,863
<i>His notebook reveals
that he never had the life that I envied.</i>

586
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,365
<i>The family life
that he craves one minute...</i>

587
00:47:04,532 --> 00:47:08,828
<i>...he rails against the next,
demanding freedom.</i>

588
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:11,873
<i>His mind...
His mind is a divided one.</i>

589
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,875
<i>His soul is restless.</i>

590
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:20,256
<i>His wife and child tormented
by his fickle and contradictory nature.</i>

591
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:26,429
What do you think?
What do you think you'll call her?

592
00:47:26,596 --> 00:47:27,847
I don't know.

593
00:47:28,014 --> 00:47:30,266
Everybody needs a name.
So, what's hers?

594
00:47:31,184 --> 00:47:32,935
Maybe Sarah.

595
00:47:35,229 --> 00:47:37,690
That's a lovely name.
That's a lovely name.

596
00:47:37,857 --> 00:47:40,985
You talk about what you wanna do
for the rest of the day.

597
00:47:41,152 --> 00:47:42,945
All right? Go on. You talk with her.

598
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,492
They're taking her away?

599
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:50,661
To the workhouse?

600
00:47:53,915 --> 00:47:55,958
Now, you keep talking.

601
00:47:58,669 --> 00:48:01,839
Tell Owens I've reconsidered.
Take it. Go on, take it.

602
00:48:06,636 --> 00:48:08,679
It's for the best.

603
00:48:13,851 --> 00:48:15,686
Let me see.

604
00:48:16,813 --> 00:48:18,773
I'm gonna learn
all the Professor's secrets.

605
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,025
Only if I teach you how to read.

606
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,570
They're just stupid tricks, right?

607
00:48:24,737 --> 00:48:27,532
Haven't helped you
get out of here, have they?

608
00:48:28,282 --> 00:48:31,536
Or can't you undo real locks,
Professor?

609
00:48:32,745 --> 00:48:35,414
Well, maybe I'm just biding my time.

610
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:41,420
Maybe one day I'll open my hand,
get your attention, ask:

611
00:48:41,587 --> 00:48:43,673
"Are you watching closely?"

612
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,592
Maybe a magic word or two.

613
00:48:48,511 --> 00:48:50,972
And then I'll be gone.

614
00:48:54,225 --> 00:48:57,478
How'd you get so famous, then, eh?

615
00:48:57,979 --> 00:48:59,605
Magic.

616
00:49:03,484 --> 00:49:04,902
Borden, get back here!

617
00:49:05,069 --> 00:49:06,571
Thank you.

618
00:49:07,196 --> 00:49:09,448
Shut up! Get him down!

619
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:11,868
Thank you.

620
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,036
Who's got a bloody key?

621
00:49:20,626 --> 00:49:23,129
<i>February 8th, 1899.</i>

622
00:49:23,296 --> 00:49:25,256
<i>Today, finally a breakthrough.</i>

623
00:49:25,923 --> 00:49:28,050
<i>Tesla's agreed to see me.</i>

624
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:36,934
It's perfectly safe.

625
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,126
So this is the Great Danton.

626
00:50:02,293 --> 00:50:06,964
Mr. Alley has effused about your act
to me on any number of occasions.

627
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:10,301
Hold out other hand.

628
00:50:19,018 --> 00:50:20,853
What's conducting the electricity?

629
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:24,315
Our bodies, Mr. Angier,
are quite capable of conducting...

630
00:50:24,482 --> 00:50:26,984
...and, indeed, producing energy.

631
00:50:28,569 --> 00:50:30,613
Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?

632
00:50:33,658 --> 00:50:35,660
I need something impossible.

633
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:42,208
You are familiar with the phrase,
"Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?

634
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,001
It's a lie.

635
00:50:44,168 --> 00:50:46,128
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.

636
00:50:47,255 --> 00:50:50,174
Society only tolerates
one change at a time.

637
00:50:51,676 --> 00:50:54,887
The first time
I tried to change the world...

638
00:50:55,054 --> 00:50:56,681
...I was hailed as a visionary.

639
00:50:57,306 --> 00:51:02,812
Second time,
I was asked politely to retire.

640
00:51:03,688 --> 00:51:06,774
So here I am, enjoying my retirement.

641
00:51:07,316 --> 00:51:09,193
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier.

642
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,070
What you want is simply expensive.

643
00:51:11,696 --> 00:51:13,698
If I were to build for you this machine...

644
00:51:13,864 --> 00:51:16,534
...you would be presenting it
merely as illusion?

645
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:20,037
Well, if people actually believed
the things I did on-stage...

646
00:51:20,204 --> 00:51:23,833
...they wouldn't clap, they'd scream.
I mean, think of sawing a woman in half.

647
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,877
Mr. Angier, have you considered
the cost of such a machine?

648
00:51:27,044 --> 00:51:28,879
Price is not an object.

649
00:51:29,547 --> 00:51:32,883
Perhaps not,
but have you considered the cost?

650
00:51:33,926 --> 00:51:35,219
I'm not sure I follow.

651
00:51:36,304 --> 00:51:38,097
Go home. Forget this thing.

652
00:51:38,556 --> 00:51:40,391
I can recognize an obsession.

653
00:51:41,017 --> 00:51:42,560
No good will come of it.

654
00:51:42,727 --> 00:51:44,520
Hasn't good come of your obsessions?

655
00:51:45,187 --> 00:51:47,773
At first.
But I have followed them too long.

656
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:53,404
I am their slave, and one day,
they will choose to destroy me.

657
00:51:54,947 --> 00:51:58,743
If you understand an obsession, then
you know you won't change my mind.

658
00:52:00,036 --> 00:52:01,078
So be it.

659
00:52:02,705 --> 00:52:03,914
Will you build it?

660
00:52:04,957 --> 00:52:08,461
I have already begun to build it,
Mr. Angier.

661
00:52:08,627 --> 00:52:11,005
I hope you enjoy the mountain air.

662
00:52:11,172 --> 00:52:13,507
This will take some time.

663
00:52:37,531 --> 00:52:39,408
I thought you'd gone.

664
00:52:40,368 --> 00:52:42,536
I don't really have anywhere to go.

665
00:52:45,414 --> 00:52:46,665
You've been sleeping here?

666
00:52:46,832 --> 00:52:51,253
Cutter said it'd be all right till we get
another booking. What are you doing?

667
00:52:52,296 --> 00:52:53,631
Research.

668
00:52:53,798 --> 00:52:58,260
Part of a magician's job is to watch
his competition, to see what illusions--

669
00:52:58,427 --> 00:53:01,180
You're going to do something
to that man, aren't you?

670
00:53:01,347 --> 00:53:03,140
Cutter's hoping you'll let things lie.

671
00:53:03,307 --> 00:53:05,976
He says if Borden thinks things
are even between you two--

672
00:53:06,143 --> 00:53:07,520
Even?

673
00:53:08,104 --> 00:53:10,648
My wife for a couple of his fingers?

674
00:53:10,815 --> 00:53:13,692
He has a family now, right?
And he's performing again.

675
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:17,613
Borden is living his life just as he always
intended, as if nothing had happened.

676
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,824
And look at-- Look at me, all right?

677
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:22,868
- I'm alone and no theater will touch me.
- Us.

678
00:53:23,828 --> 00:53:26,497
You're going to need a better disguise.

679
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:44,682
Need a volunteer.

680
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,393
<i>What happened?</i>

681
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:50,563
Did you hurt him?

682
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:53,482
What happened, Robert?

683
00:53:55,901 --> 00:53:57,319
You, sir.

684
00:53:58,028 --> 00:54:00,865
Just a rubber ball, yes? Thank you.

685
00:54:01,031 --> 00:54:03,534
Just a rubber ball, no.

686
00:54:03,701 --> 00:54:06,871
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

687
00:54:07,037 --> 00:54:08,080
It's magic.

688
00:54:08,914 --> 00:54:10,875
He had a new trick.

689
00:54:24,722 --> 00:54:25,764
<i>Was it good?</i>

690
00:54:30,895 --> 00:54:33,314
It was the greatest magic trick
I've ever seen.

691
00:54:39,403 --> 00:54:40,905
<i>Did they applaud when you saw it?</i>

692
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:43,115
The trick was too good,
it was too simple.

693
00:54:43,282 --> 00:54:46,368
- The audience hardly had time to see it.
- He's a dreadful magician.

694
00:54:46,535 --> 00:54:49,079
No, he's a wonderful magician.
He's a dreadful showman.

695
00:54:49,246 --> 00:54:51,457
He doesn't know how to dress it up,
how to sell--

696
00:54:51,624 --> 00:54:53,250
- How does he do it?
- Uses a double.

697
00:54:53,417 --> 00:54:56,045
No, no, no, it's too simple.
This is a complex illusion.

698
00:54:56,212 --> 00:54:58,589
You only say that because
you don't know the method.

699
00:54:58,756 --> 00:55:00,925
It's a double at the end.
It's the only way.

700
00:55:01,091 --> 00:55:03,260
I've seen him perform the trick
three times now.

701
00:55:03,427 --> 00:55:05,930
- The Prestige is the same man.
- No, it's not.

702
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:08,557
The same man comes out
of that second cabinet.

703
00:55:08,724 --> 00:55:09,808
It's the same man.

704
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,437
He wears padded gloves
to hide his damaged fingers...

705
00:55:13,604 --> 00:55:15,481
...but if you look closely you can tell.

706
00:55:18,275 --> 00:55:20,903
He doesn't know how to sell it
to an audience, but I do.

707
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:23,405
Yeah, well, we can use it
as a climax to the show.

708
00:55:23,822 --> 00:55:25,699
Yes.

709
00:55:25,866 --> 00:55:29,119
The man stole my life,
I'm gonna steal his trick.

710
00:55:29,286 --> 00:55:32,456
- Find someone who looks like you.
- He doesn't use a double.

711
00:55:32,623 --> 00:55:35,960
Robert, I don't know
how Borden does the trick, so either--

712
00:55:36,126 --> 00:55:39,505
You either wait for him to retire
and buy the secret...

713
00:55:39,672 --> 00:55:41,465
...or you listen to how I would do it.

714
00:55:41,632 --> 00:55:46,512
The only way that I know how to do it
is to find you a bloody good double.

715
00:55:47,471 --> 00:55:49,098
All right.

716
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:52,851
Take a good look.
Let's get out there and find me.

717
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,520
Whoo!

718
00:55:55,062 --> 00:55:56,981
Look. Look.

719
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:02,695
What's that?

720
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:06,991
That is for you.

721
00:56:07,157 --> 00:56:08,909
What's this for?

722
00:56:09,076 --> 00:56:10,703
Come here.

723
00:56:15,874 --> 00:56:19,628
- I asked you last week. You said you--
- You caught me in a wrong mood.

724
00:56:19,837 --> 00:56:21,171
But you went over all the--

725
00:56:21,338 --> 00:56:24,883
Sarah, I'm allowed
to change my mind, aren't I?

726
00:56:25,384 --> 00:56:28,804
The act is taking off,
soon we'll be in a bigger theater.

727
00:56:28,971 --> 00:56:30,180
Things will work out.

728
00:56:32,641 --> 00:56:34,351
I can't believe it. Thank you.

729
00:56:34,518 --> 00:56:36,395
Thank you. It's beautiful.

730
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:44,862
Gerry?

731
00:56:45,237 --> 00:56:46,280
Darling, look at you.

732
00:56:46,447 --> 00:56:49,199
Mr. Cutter, Mr. Angier,
I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.

733
00:56:49,408 --> 00:56:50,784
Hm.

734
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:57,750
A pleasure.
Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.

735
00:56:58,334 --> 00:57:02,212
Would you like for me
to tell you a little joke? Come here.

736
00:57:04,048 --> 00:57:06,050
There we are. Yes?

737
00:57:06,216 --> 00:57:08,218
Are you laughing now?

738
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:13,223
Oh, dear, I have to take a piss.

739
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:17,728
- He's out of his mind.
- Of course. He's an out-of-work actor.

740
00:57:17,895 --> 00:57:19,730
He's perfect. He needs a little help...

741
00:57:19,897 --> 00:57:22,733
...but when I get done with him,
he could be your brother.

742
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,402
I don't need him to be my brother,
I need him to be me.

743
00:57:25,569 --> 00:57:27,196
Give me a month.

744
00:57:31,075 --> 00:57:32,910
Come around.

745
00:57:34,078 --> 00:57:38,415
So you open the door and...

746
00:57:45,673 --> 00:57:47,257
Come on.

747
00:57:49,677 --> 00:57:50,886
Ugh!

748
00:57:51,136 --> 00:57:54,890
- Couldn't you have found a softer one?
- Well, it's not for sleeping on.

749
00:57:55,474 --> 00:57:59,103
- So if you come down through there...
- Mm-hm.

750
00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:03,148
- ...does Root go up through there?
- Yep.

751
00:58:03,565 --> 00:58:05,275
It's going to be amazing, Robert.

752
00:58:05,818 --> 00:58:09,613
Well, it has to be.
Borden's trick is getting noticed.

753
00:58:11,657 --> 00:58:14,034
The place was packed today.

754
00:58:15,703 --> 00:58:17,454
You went and saw his show again.

755
00:58:17,621 --> 00:58:19,957
Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier?

756
00:58:28,632 --> 00:58:30,634
All I have to do is keep myself drunk...

757
00:58:30,801 --> 00:58:33,095
...and no one will be able
to tell the difference.

758
00:58:33,262 --> 00:58:35,139
Have a little faith, sir.

759
00:58:35,305 --> 00:58:39,017
Now, would you favor us
with a performance, Mr. Root?

760
00:58:44,106 --> 00:58:45,524
Jesus.

761
00:59:00,914 --> 00:59:04,126
Yes, you would drink too if you knew
the world half as well as I do.

762
00:59:07,963 --> 00:59:09,506
Did you think you were unique?

763
00:59:09,673 --> 00:59:12,176
I have been Caesar. I played Faust.

764
00:59:12,342 --> 00:59:15,345
How difficult could it possibly be
to play the Great Danton?

765
00:59:15,512 --> 00:59:18,682
You can go back to being yourself now,
Root, for nothing.

766
00:59:18,849 --> 00:59:21,018
I'd rather be him for now.

767
00:59:21,185 --> 00:59:23,979
I find it amusing.

768
00:59:27,357 --> 00:59:31,445
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.

769
00:59:32,571 --> 00:59:34,490
- You look wonderful.
- Oh, thank you.

770
00:59:34,656 --> 00:59:37,743
Root has to keep a low profile.
Anyone sees him, the game's up.

771
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:40,871
I don't know how you do these things.
I'm not sure I wanna know.

772
00:59:41,246 --> 00:59:42,998
Have you thought
what we should call the trick?

773
00:59:43,165 --> 00:59:44,625
There's no point in being coy.

774
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:47,169
Borden calls his trick
"The Transported Man."

775
00:59:51,465 --> 00:59:54,051
Ladies and gentlemen,
much of what you've seen tonight...

776
00:59:54,218 --> 00:59:58,889
...may be termed as illusions
or entertaining trifles.

777
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,228
Alas...

778
01:00:06,396 --> 01:00:08,857
...I cannot claim
this next feat as illusion.

779
01:00:09,733 --> 01:00:10,901
Watch carefully.

780
01:00:12,402 --> 01:00:14,863
You'll see no trickery...

781
01:00:15,322 --> 01:00:16,907
...for no trickery is employed.

782
01:00:18,075 --> 01:00:21,411
Merely a technique familiar
to certain citizens of the Orient...

783
01:00:21,578 --> 01:00:23,747
...and various holy men
of the Himalayas.

784
01:00:27,209 --> 01:00:29,920
Indeed, many of you
may be familiar with this technique...

785
01:00:30,087 --> 01:00:33,131
...but for those of you who aren't,
do not be alarmed...

786
01:00:33,298 --> 01:00:36,385
...what you're about to see
is considered safe.

787
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:10,460
To our achievement.

788
01:01:11,128 --> 01:01:13,797
The manager says
he's never seen a reaction like it.

789
01:01:13,964 --> 01:01:17,175
At least he got to see it. I spent
the ovation hiding under the stage.

790
01:01:17,342 --> 01:01:19,803
No one cares about the man
who disappears into the box.

791
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:21,638
They care about the one
who comes out.

792
01:01:21,805 --> 01:01:24,641
- I care about the man in the box.
- Thank you.

793
01:01:24,808 --> 01:01:28,145
I don't know. Maybe--
Maybe we could switch before the trick.

794
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:30,480
I could be the Prestige
and Root ends up below.

795
01:01:30,647 --> 01:01:33,317
No, the anticipation of the trick
is everything.

796
01:01:33,483 --> 01:01:36,528
We need your showmanship
to build up the suspense.

797
01:01:36,695 --> 01:01:39,990
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over.
He can't introduce this trick.

798
01:01:40,157 --> 01:01:42,993
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

799
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,663
Root, you bloody fool.
Get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

800
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:49,333
Anyone could walk in here
at any minute.

801
01:01:49,499 --> 01:01:51,501
Congratulations, all.

802
01:01:51,835 --> 01:01:55,255
Life is not full of these moments,
Robbie. We worked hard.

803
01:01:55,422 --> 01:01:57,007
We need to celebrate properly.

804
01:02:00,677 --> 01:02:03,221
What's wrong? Is it your wife?

805
01:02:03,388 --> 01:02:05,641
No. No, it's the trick.
It isn't good enough.

806
01:02:05,807 --> 01:02:09,019
Borden's trick is nothing
compared to ours. He has no style.

807
01:02:09,186 --> 01:02:13,023
Well, he doesn't spend the finale
hiding under the stage.

808
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:14,858
I need to know how he does it.

809
01:02:15,025 --> 01:02:18,403
- Why?
- So I can do it better.

810
01:02:20,614 --> 01:02:22,532
I need you to go and work for him.

811
01:02:26,161 --> 01:02:27,829
Work for him? Are you joking?

812
01:02:29,122 --> 01:02:30,248
You'll be my spy.

813
01:02:30,415 --> 01:02:32,501
We just got our start.
You want me to leave?

814
01:02:32,668 --> 01:02:34,711
That's how we advance.
Think of it, Olivia.

815
01:02:34,878 --> 01:02:38,507
We got people excited, but imagine
what we could do with the real illusion.

816
01:02:38,674 --> 01:02:42,511
We'd have the greatest magic act
anyone's ever seen.

817
01:02:42,678 --> 01:02:44,054
He knows I work for you.

818
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:47,516
Exactly why he'll wanna hire you.
He'll want my secret.

819
01:02:47,683 --> 01:02:51,728
- Why would he trust me?
- Because you're gonna tell him the truth.

820
01:02:54,898 --> 01:02:56,149
Hm?

821
01:03:04,074 --> 01:03:05,117
Good girl.

822
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:11,873
You must be curious to see what so
much money has bought you, Mr. Angier.

823
01:03:12,499 --> 01:03:15,377
It's fitting you should be here
for maiden voyage.

824
01:03:15,544 --> 01:03:17,254
Your hat.

825
01:03:25,387 --> 01:03:27,597
You might wanna stand back.

826
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,453
I don't understand.

827
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:51,913
Perhaps it would be best
if you left us to it.

828
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,207
- Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla?
- No, no, no.

829
01:03:54,374 --> 01:03:55,917
- Come back next week.
- Next week?

830
01:03:56,084 --> 01:03:58,170
- Come back-- Next week, it'll be fine.
- Tesla.

831
01:03:58,336 --> 01:04:01,089
She's just a little temperamental
sometimes.

832
01:04:06,011 --> 01:04:08,805
- Interesting workshop.
- Yeah, we make do.

833
01:04:08,972 --> 01:04:11,308
- My name is Olivia Wenscombe--
- I know who you are.

834
01:04:11,475 --> 01:04:12,809
You here to steal my show?

835
01:04:12,976 --> 01:04:14,770
I'm here to give it what it's missing.

836
01:04:14,936 --> 01:04:18,106
- Yeah? What might that be?
- Me.

837
01:04:19,649 --> 01:04:23,612
I was just saying that, wasn't I,
Bernard? Woman's touch.

838
01:04:23,779 --> 01:04:25,614
- I've left Angier.
- All right.

839
01:04:25,781 --> 01:04:28,492
- I want a job.
- Yeah?

840
01:04:28,658 --> 01:04:31,661
- I know you've no reason to trust me--
- Why wouldn't I trust you?

841
01:04:31,828 --> 01:04:35,665
I mean, you're only the mistress of
my enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you?

842
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:39,169
- Mr. Borden--
- Alfred.

843
01:04:41,588 --> 01:04:43,173
I'm going to tell you the truth.

844
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:46,510
Now that is a slippery notion
in our line of work...

845
01:04:46,676 --> 01:04:47,969
...isn't it, Miss Wenscombe?

846
01:04:50,097 --> 01:04:52,682
I am here because he sent me here.

847
01:04:52,849 --> 01:04:55,310
He wants me to work for you
and steal your secret.

848
01:04:55,477 --> 01:04:57,145
What does he need my secret for?

849
01:04:57,312 --> 01:04:58,688
His trick is top-notch.

850
01:04:59,314 --> 01:05:02,526
He vanishes and then he reappears
on the other side of the stage...

851
01:05:02,692 --> 01:05:06,530
...mute, overweight and,
unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.

852
01:05:06,696 --> 01:05:08,365
It's astonishing. How does he do it?

853
01:05:08,824 --> 01:05:13,662
And tell me, Olivia, does he enjoy
taking his bows under the stage?

854
01:05:13,829 --> 01:05:14,871
No, it's killing him.

855
01:05:15,038 --> 01:05:17,040
He's obsessed
with discovering your methods.

856
01:05:17,207 --> 01:05:18,416
He thinks of nothing else.

857
01:05:18,583 --> 01:05:21,670
He takes no pleasure in our success,
and I've had enough.

858
01:05:21,837 --> 01:05:23,255
There is no future with him.

859
01:05:25,465 --> 01:05:29,094
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you his.

860
01:05:29,594 --> 01:05:33,181
This is the truth, is it?

861
01:05:37,686 --> 01:05:39,396
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.

862
01:05:39,563 --> 01:05:41,773
Root, you're late
and more drunk than usual.

863
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,568
- Now, get down below stairs right away.
- No.

864
01:05:46,153 --> 01:05:49,239
No, we need to have
a little chat, Mr. Cutter.

865
01:05:49,406 --> 01:05:50,448
We have a problem.

866
01:05:50,615 --> 01:05:53,201
Cutter, Borden is performing
right across the street.

867
01:05:53,368 --> 01:05:55,996
Yeah? We have a bigger problem.

868
01:05:57,122 --> 01:06:00,083
Root. He's realized
he can make demands.

869
01:06:00,917 --> 01:06:02,252
Wha--? He's blackmailing us?

870
01:06:02,419 --> 01:06:04,254
I was surprised, to tell the truth.

871
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:06,590
It usually takes them longer
to figure it out.

872
01:06:06,756 --> 01:06:09,551
- Well, how much does he want?
- Well, it makes no difference.

873
01:06:09,718 --> 01:06:13,096
- We gotta stop doing the trick.
- Stop the trick? Cutter, look at this.

874
01:06:13,263 --> 01:06:15,432
Well, look at yesterday's,
look at last week...

875
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,935
...where they said you were
the premier stage performer in London.

876
01:06:19,102 --> 01:06:20,687
Not magician, mind you.

877
01:06:20,854 --> 01:06:23,440
- Performer of any kind.
- Well, what's your point?

878
01:06:23,607 --> 01:06:25,901
My point is, Robert,
is you've climbed too high...

879
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:28,278
...to get away
with professional embarrassment.

880
01:06:28,862 --> 01:06:31,656
We don't do any tricks
we can't control.

881
01:06:33,867 --> 01:06:35,660
Just pay him
whatever he wants for now.

882
01:06:35,827 --> 01:06:39,247
We keep doing the trick until Borden
opens and then we'll phase it out.

883
01:06:40,332 --> 01:06:41,791
All right.

884
01:06:44,461 --> 01:06:48,465
<i>Cutter was always surprised
how fast Root turned bad.</i>

885
01:06:49,049 --> 01:06:53,053
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this rather welcome pint of ale?

886
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:56,598
- You're the Great Danton, aren't you?
- Shh, shh, shh.

887
01:06:56,765 --> 01:07:00,101
Of course I am, but don't advertise it
because I'll be mobbed with fans.

888
01:07:00,268 --> 01:07:02,145
<i>We paid him enough
to keep him in beers...</i>

889
01:07:02,312 --> 01:07:04,481
<i>...so you wouldn't expect him
to rock the boat.</i>

890
01:07:04,648 --> 01:07:07,192
Indeed, many of you
may be familiar with this technique.

891
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:10,987
But for those of you who aren't,
do not be alarmed...

892
01:07:11,154 --> 01:07:14,199
...what you're about to see
is considered safe.

893
01:07:14,366 --> 01:07:15,659
And who are you?

894
01:07:15,825 --> 01:07:20,747
I am a humble admirer
and a fellow practitioner.

895
01:07:20,914 --> 01:07:22,999
Hm. Very good.

896
01:07:32,509 --> 01:07:35,178
- Another?
- Oh, if you insist.

897
01:07:35,345 --> 01:07:37,264
- Another.
- I'm not performing tonight.

898
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,182
Well, I'm only doing one show...

899
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:42,519
...but to be frank, my people
pretty much run things these days.

900
01:07:42,686 --> 01:07:43,812
Get up there!

901
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:46,273
Get up!

902
01:07:46,439 --> 01:07:48,608
Your illusion, The Transported Man...

903
01:07:48,775 --> 01:07:51,736
...I'm not claiming
to know your methods or anything...

904
01:07:52,445 --> 01:07:58,910
...but I had a similar trick in my act,
and I used a double.

905
01:07:59,327 --> 01:08:01,413
Oh. I see. Very good.

906
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:04,165
Well, it was, and then it went bad.

907
01:08:04,332 --> 01:08:09,713
What I didn't count on, was that when
I incorporated this bloke into my act...

908
01:08:09,879 --> 01:08:11,881
...he had complete power over me.

909
01:08:13,216 --> 01:08:14,676
Complete power, you say.

910
01:08:30,608 --> 01:08:31,901
Oh!

911
01:08:32,235 --> 01:08:37,407
Be very careful giving someone
that power over you.

912
01:08:39,784 --> 01:08:41,745
Well, thank you.

913
01:08:41,911 --> 01:08:44,205
Yes, thank you for the warning.

914
01:08:46,374 --> 01:08:48,335
Cheers.

915
01:08:49,085 --> 01:08:51,087
I cannot claim this next feat
as illusion.

916
01:08:51,254 --> 01:08:55,467
What you're about to see
is considered safe.

917
01:08:59,012 --> 01:09:00,513
Ah!

918
01:09:33,671 --> 01:09:34,839
Oh!

919
01:09:35,465 --> 01:09:37,675
The Great Danton.

920
01:09:44,057 --> 01:09:45,725
I apologize.

921
01:09:45,892 --> 01:09:49,646
There simply is too much magic...

922
01:09:49,813 --> 01:09:54,818
...for my stage at the Pantages
across the street.

923
01:09:56,152 --> 01:09:58,696
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

924
01:09:58,863 --> 01:10:02,283
Pardon my intrusion.

925
01:10:02,951 --> 01:10:05,787
- Bravo!
- And go easy on the poor chap.

926
01:10:05,954 --> 01:10:08,540
He does try so very hard.

927
01:10:11,668 --> 01:10:13,503
I don't know how Borden found him.

928
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:15,338
Kept him under wraps, I was careful.

929
01:10:15,505 --> 01:10:17,549
Yeah, well, he did.

930
01:10:18,383 --> 01:10:19,509
Do you think it was her?

931
01:10:26,933 --> 01:10:29,561
You weren't expecting me?

932
01:10:29,727 --> 01:10:32,397
I was expecting you sooner.
Your message said afternoon.

933
01:10:32,564 --> 01:10:34,691
It takes a bit
for me to get around these days.

934
01:10:35,024 --> 01:10:36,693
He's taken everything from me.

935
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:39,529
My wife, my career, now you.

936
01:10:39,696 --> 01:10:41,072
What do you mean?
You sent me--

937
01:10:41,239 --> 01:10:43,908
I sent you to steal his secret,
not to improve his act.

938
01:10:44,075 --> 01:10:45,535
- That's my job.
- Or fall in love.

939
01:10:45,702 --> 01:10:48,288
- I did everything you asked!
- Yes? Yes?

940
01:10:48,455 --> 01:10:50,999
- Then how does he do it?
- Cutter was right, a double.

941
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:54,419
- Of course Borden said that.
- He didn't say anything. I've seen things.

942
01:10:54,586 --> 01:10:58,381
Makeup, glasses, wigs. We don't use it
for the show, but I've seen it backstage.

943
01:10:58,548 --> 01:11:02,260
Misdirection. He leaves things around
to make you think he's using a double.

944
01:11:02,427 --> 01:11:04,304
All the time?
He doesn't know when I look.

945
01:11:04,471 --> 01:11:06,389
All the time, Olivia!

946
01:11:06,556 --> 01:11:08,892
That's who he is! That's what it takes!

947
01:11:09,058 --> 01:11:11,394
He lives his act! Don't you see?

948
01:11:13,563 --> 01:11:16,733
Just because you're sleeping with him
doesn't mean he trusts you.

949
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,235
You think you can see everything,
don't you?

950
01:11:19,402 --> 01:11:23,072
But the Great Danton is a blind fool.
His notebook.

951
01:11:25,116 --> 01:11:27,243
You stole it?

952
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:29,204
I borrowed it for tonight.

953
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,331
I thought you could translate it,
but now--

954
01:11:31,498 --> 01:11:32,582
- I can't.
- You can't?

955
01:11:32,749 --> 01:11:35,585
Olivia, no one can, it's a cipher.

956
01:11:35,752 --> 01:11:38,671
Even with the keyword
it would take months to decode.

957
01:11:39,172 --> 01:11:42,091
- And without the keyword?
- Perhaps never.

958
01:11:42,258 --> 01:11:43,676
- We'll see.
- We will not see.

959
01:11:43,843 --> 01:11:46,763
If I don't get that back to him
tomorrow, he'll know I took it.

960
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:49,098
- Leave him.
- I can't. He knows where I live.

961
01:11:50,517 --> 01:11:52,435
This is his diary, Olivia.

962
01:11:52,602 --> 01:11:55,271
All of his secrets
are right here in my hands.

963
01:11:56,272 --> 01:11:57,482
Won't bring your wife back.

964
01:11:57,649 --> 01:12:00,818
I don't care about my wife,
I care about his secret.

965
01:12:13,623 --> 01:12:15,458
Look...

966
01:12:16,459 --> 01:12:18,628
...I'll go to his workshop
and stage a break-in.

967
01:12:18,795 --> 01:12:22,966
- He'll know you took it.
- Yes, me. Not you.

968
01:12:23,132 --> 01:12:24,926
Understand?

969
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:35,061
Robert.

970
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:39,691
I have fallen in love with him.

971
01:12:40,692 --> 01:12:43,403
Then I know how hard
this has been for you.

972
01:12:51,786 --> 01:12:52,996
Notebook?

973
01:12:55,915 --> 01:12:57,750
Then he's just getting started.

974
01:13:28,573 --> 01:13:30,533
- Good evening.
- Professor.

975
01:13:31,618 --> 01:13:32,744
Professor.

976
01:13:33,202 --> 01:13:34,996
- I, uh...
- Could I get your autograph?

977
01:13:35,163 --> 01:13:38,583
I'm walking tonight.
Let him come. I don't care.

978
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:41,169
- Professor.
- Professor.

979
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,381
- You all right?
- I'm alive.

980
01:15:08,548 --> 01:15:10,633
Saves me cutting you an air hole.

981
01:15:24,731 --> 01:15:27,191
- I'm impressed.
- Why's that?

982
01:15:27,358 --> 01:15:29,861
You're finally getting your hands dirty.

983
01:15:30,403 --> 01:15:33,197
It's what a good trick costs, Angier.

984
01:15:33,364 --> 01:15:34,699
Risk.

985
01:15:34,866 --> 01:15:36,117
Sacrifice.

986
01:15:36,659 --> 01:15:40,329
The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is gonna be
yours, unless you give me what I want.

987
01:15:41,789 --> 01:15:43,833
- Which is?
- Your secret.

988
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:46,252
My secret?

989
01:15:46,419 --> 01:15:48,671
Your method for The Transported Man.

990
01:15:48,838 --> 01:15:51,466
Fallon wouldn't tell me.
He doesn't seem to talk at all.

991
01:15:51,632 --> 01:15:52,884
You have my notebook.

992
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:55,011
Useless without the keyword.

993
01:15:56,512 --> 01:15:58,139
Write down your method, Mr. Borden.

994
01:15:58,306 --> 01:16:00,183
Describe it in full.

995
01:16:13,237 --> 01:16:15,865
I want the whole method,
not the keyword.

996
01:16:16,032 --> 01:16:18,409
I don't even know
if your secret's in your notebook.

997
01:16:18,576 --> 01:16:20,870
The keyword is the method.

998
01:16:24,665 --> 01:16:25,833
Where's my <i>ingénieur?</i>

999
01:16:33,132 --> 01:16:35,551
- Alive?
- How fast can you dig?

1000
01:16:38,137 --> 01:16:41,098
Fallon! You hear me? Fallon!

1001
01:16:42,517 --> 01:16:45,061
- How's the arm?
- Still attached.

1002
01:16:46,604 --> 01:16:48,940
- Did you find your answer?
- Our answer.

1003
01:16:49,106 --> 01:16:51,901
Cutter, I haven't looked yet.
I wanted you to share this.

1004
01:16:52,068 --> 01:16:54,570
I already know how he does it, Robert.

1005
01:16:54,737 --> 01:16:57,573
The same way he always has.
The same way as we do.

1006
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:00,117
It's just that you want
something more.

1007
01:17:00,284 --> 01:17:01,869
Well, let's find out then,
shall we?

1008
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:08,709
What does it mean?

1009
01:17:16,759 --> 01:17:19,053
It means, Cutter,
we have a journey ahead of us.

1010
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:21,931
- To America.
- Robert?

1011
01:17:22,098 --> 01:17:24,267
Listen to me.

1012
01:17:25,184 --> 01:17:28,563
Obsession is a young man's game.

1013
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:32,650
- Oh, come on.
- I can't follow you any further in it.

1014
01:17:33,901 --> 01:17:35,611
I can't. I'm sorry.

1015
01:17:39,949 --> 01:17:41,450
Then the rest is up to me.

1016
01:17:43,536 --> 01:17:45,162
I'm sorry.

1017
01:17:50,376 --> 01:17:53,796
Good evening. Hello, darling.

1018
01:17:54,213 --> 01:17:55,590
Champagne, your finest.

1019
01:17:56,299 --> 01:17:58,718
I didn't know we were
going to be joined for dinner.

1020
01:17:58,885 --> 01:18:01,804
- Absolutely. We are celebrating.
- Miss Wenscombe.

1021
01:18:01,971 --> 01:18:04,932
Mr. Fallon.
Well, what are we celebrating?

1022
01:18:05,099 --> 01:18:07,518
Well, we've hit upon a new trick,
haven't we, Fallon?

1023
01:18:07,685 --> 01:18:10,605
- What trick, Freddy?
- Yes, Freddy, what trick?

1024
01:18:10,771 --> 01:18:15,026
I am going to bury myself alive
every night...

1025
01:18:15,192 --> 01:18:18,988
...and then someone will come along
and dig me up. Wonderful.

1026
01:18:19,155 --> 01:18:23,034
- I think my husband's had quite enough.
- Pour the champagne. Come on, pour--

1027
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,953
Right. Sarah, don't talk to me like that.
I'm not a child.

1028
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,080
- Perhaps it would--
- Perhaps, Mr. Fallon...

1029
01:18:28,247 --> 01:18:31,334
...you might escort Miss Wenscombe
home. My husband's being a bore.

1030
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:35,046
- I see no reason why you have to suffer.
- Oh, please. Don't ruin this evening.

1031
01:18:38,507 --> 01:18:42,053
Good night, Mrs. Borden.
Good night, Freddy.

1032
01:18:45,848 --> 01:18:48,017
- "Freddy"?
- Well, that's my name.

1033
01:18:48,184 --> 01:18:52,438
- Not at home.
- Well, I'm not always at home, am I?

1034
01:18:53,397 --> 01:18:56,442
Well, couldn't you have at least
taken off the beard?

1035
01:18:56,609 --> 01:19:00,154
Sarah, I just came from
the bloody theater just now.

1036
01:19:00,321 --> 01:19:02,031
All right? And I'm out in public.

1037
01:19:02,198 --> 01:19:05,326
- Everybody else loves it.
- Why are you being like this, Alfred?

1038
01:19:05,952 --> 01:19:08,245
I had a terrible ordeal today.

1039
01:19:08,621 --> 01:19:13,042
I thought that something
very precious...

1040
01:19:13,209 --> 01:19:15,127
...had been lost to me.

1041
01:19:15,294 --> 01:19:18,381
So I just wanted to celebrate.
Just a little.

1042
01:19:19,215 --> 01:19:20,841
All right, what?

1043
01:19:21,008 --> 01:19:22,718
What did you lose?

1044
01:19:27,306 --> 01:19:28,683
I see, more secrets.

1045
01:19:29,642 --> 01:19:32,728
Sarah, secrets are my life.

1046
01:19:34,772 --> 01:19:36,816
- Our life.
- No, Alfred, stop.

1047
01:19:36,983 --> 01:19:40,528
This isn't you. Stop performing.

1048
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:07,263
I thought I had the place
to myself, Mr. Brent.

1049
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:12,435
Unexpected guests.
Not very polite. A lot of questions.

1050
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:15,229
First I thought they might work
for the government.

1051
01:20:15,396 --> 01:20:17,273
- No?
- Worse.

1052
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,608
They work for Thomas Edison.

1053
01:20:20,985 --> 01:20:23,404
<i>Today, a most curious development.</i>

1054
01:20:23,571 --> 01:20:27,616
<i>His assistant came to us
with a proposition.</i>

1055
01:20:28,409 --> 01:20:31,662
<i>Obviously, Angier has sent her
and told her to admit as much.</i>

1056
01:20:31,829 --> 01:20:34,582
Does he enjoy taking
his bows under the stage?

1057
01:20:34,749 --> 01:20:38,419
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you his.

1058
01:20:38,919 --> 01:20:42,465
This is the truth, is it?

1059
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:53,934
No, that's what he told me
to tell you. The truth...

1060
01:20:54,101 --> 01:20:57,897
...is that I loved him, and I stood by him,
and he sent me to you...

1061
01:20:58,064 --> 01:21:01,442
...like he would send a stagehand
to pick up his shirts.

1062
01:21:01,609 --> 01:21:04,278
I hate him for that.

1063
01:21:04,612 --> 01:21:08,449
I can spot Angier's methods
from the back of the theater.

1064
01:21:09,617 --> 01:21:11,660
So, what could you possibly
have to offer me?

1065
01:21:12,161 --> 01:21:14,914
You know how he does his tricks,
but you can't understand...

1066
01:21:15,081 --> 01:21:17,541
...why no one can see yours
are better. You hide this.

1067
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:21,670
I had to look very closely to spot it when
you perform The Transported Man...

1068
01:21:21,837 --> 01:21:24,465
...but this makes you unique.

1069
01:21:24,632 --> 01:21:26,801
It shows the audience
you aren't using a double.

1070
01:21:26,967 --> 01:21:29,053
You mustn't hide it,
display it proudly.

1071
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:33,516
I'm sure it takes great skill to
perform illusions with one good hand.

1072
01:21:33,974 --> 01:21:36,018
Yeah, it does.

1073
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,106
So let people know.

1074
01:21:40,773 --> 01:21:44,527
You could be so much more than he is,
and I can show you how.

1075
01:21:46,028 --> 01:21:47,822
<i>I think she's telling the truth.</i>

1076
01:21:48,697 --> 01:21:50,825
<i>I think we cannot trust her.</i>

1077
01:21:54,411 --> 01:21:56,831
<i>But I love her. I need her.</i>

1078
01:21:58,124 --> 01:22:01,210
<i>To open myself
to such a relationship...</i>

1079
01:22:01,377 --> 01:22:05,214
<i>...to the dangers of such an affair...</i>

1080
01:22:05,714 --> 01:22:10,094
<i>...I need assurances of fidelity.
Of love.</i>

1081
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:12,721
<i>But how to be sure?</i>

1082
01:22:15,099 --> 01:22:19,353
<i>I know a way.
It's the only way to know her mind.</i>

1083
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,188
How could he send you away?

1084
01:22:23,065 --> 01:22:26,068
<i>She must help me rid ourselves of Angier.</i>

1085
01:22:32,867 --> 01:22:35,661
<i>Today, my mistress proves
her truthfulness.</i>

1086
01:22:35,828 --> 01:22:38,080
<i>Not to me, you understand.</i>

1087
01:22:38,289 --> 01:22:40,291
<i>I've been convinced
since she led me to Root.</i>

1088
01:22:40,457 --> 01:22:46,255
<i>Today, Olivia proves her love for me
to you, Angier.</i>

1089
01:22:46,422 --> 01:22:48,299
<i>Yes, Angier.</i>

1090
01:22:48,465 --> 01:22:50,759
<i>She gave you this notebook
at my reąuest.</i>

1091
01:22:50,926 --> 01:22:56,098
<i>And, yes, "Tesla" is merely the key
to my diary, not to my trick.</i>

1092
01:22:56,265 --> 01:23:00,811
<i>Did you really think I'd part with
my secret so easily after so much?</i>

1093
01:23:00,978 --> 01:23:02,229
<i>Goodbye, Angier.</i>

1094
01:23:02,396 --> 01:23:06,483
<i>May you find solace for your thwarted
ambition back in your American home.</i>

1095
01:23:16,994 --> 01:23:18,287
Tesla!

1096
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:24,168
Tesla! Alley! Alley!

1097
01:23:24,335 --> 01:23:26,754
Tesla never made a machine
like the one I asked for.

1098
01:23:26,921 --> 01:23:29,632
- We never said he had.
- But you let me believe that he had.

1099
01:23:29,798 --> 01:23:32,468
You stole my money because
your funding had been cut off.

1100
01:23:32,635 --> 01:23:36,388
You've been shooting sparks at my
top hat, laughing at me all along...

1101
01:23:36,555 --> 01:23:39,016
...while using my money
to stave off ruin.

1102
01:23:40,059 --> 01:23:41,977
- Now, I have seen Edison's men.
- Where?

1103
01:23:42,144 --> 01:23:45,147
In the hotel. And I have every mind
to bring them up here myself.

1104
01:23:45,314 --> 01:23:47,316
That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.

1105
01:23:47,483 --> 01:23:50,527
It is true that you are
our last remaining financier...

1106
01:23:50,694 --> 01:23:52,488
...but we have not stolen your money.

1107
01:23:52,655 --> 01:23:53,989
Sir, my cat.

1108
01:23:54,156 --> 01:23:57,159
When I told you I could make
your machine, I spoke a simple truth.

1109
01:23:57,326 --> 01:24:00,746
- Then why isn't the machine working?
- Because exact science, Mr. Angier...

1110
01:24:00,913 --> 01:24:02,456
...is not an exact science.

1111
01:24:02,623 --> 01:24:05,459
The machine simply does not operate
as expected.

1112
01:24:05,626 --> 01:24:07,878
It requires further examination.

1113
01:24:08,045 --> 01:24:10,673
- So where did my top hat go?
- Nowhere.

1114
01:24:10,839 --> 01:24:13,592
We tried the damn thing
a dozen times.

1115
01:24:13,759 --> 01:24:15,094
The hat went nowhere.

1116
01:24:15,261 --> 01:24:17,179
We need to try different material.

1117
01:24:17,346 --> 01:24:20,432
It may provoke a different result.

1118
01:24:22,184 --> 01:24:23,644
Copernicus, come on.

1119
01:24:30,818 --> 01:24:35,322
You are responsible for whatever
happens to this animal, doctor.

1120
01:24:56,385 --> 01:25:00,055
I hope that whatever you were doing
with my money was more worthwhile...

1121
01:25:00,222 --> 01:25:02,182
...Mr. Tesla.

1122
01:25:57,237 --> 01:25:58,280
Alley!

1123
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:02,951
So the machine was working.

1124
01:26:03,118 --> 01:26:06,622
I never bothered to check the calibration
because the hat never moved.

1125
01:26:06,789 --> 01:26:09,875
These things never quite work
as you expect them to, Mr. Angier.

1126
01:26:10,042 --> 01:26:12,211
That's one of the principal
beauties of science.

1127
01:26:12,378 --> 01:26:15,756
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out
the problems with the machine.

1128
01:26:15,923 --> 01:26:18,133
We'll send word when it's ready.

1129
01:26:20,302 --> 01:26:22,429
Don't forget your hat.

1130
01:26:23,263 --> 01:26:27,017
- Well, which one is mine?
- They're all your hats, Mr. Angier.

1131
01:26:33,023 --> 01:26:35,943
You look so pretty
in this new dress of yours.

1132
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:37,986
Are we going to the zoo
this afternoon?

1133
01:26:38,153 --> 01:26:39,988
No, no, no.
Daddy has some errands to run.

1134
01:26:40,155 --> 01:26:42,157
- But you promised.
- I promised, did I?

1135
01:26:42,324 --> 01:26:44,493
Then go to the zoo we shall.

1136
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:47,955
So Daddy will go run his errands
and I'll be back before you know it...

1137
01:26:48,122 --> 01:26:50,916
...so you go get ready.
We'll go see those chimpanzees.

1138
01:26:55,087 --> 01:26:57,047
Sarah.

1139
01:26:57,423 --> 01:26:59,216
What are you doing?

1140
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:05,139
We each of us have our vices.

1141
01:27:08,183 --> 01:27:11,603
Sarah, whatever you may think...

1142
01:27:12,104 --> 01:27:15,691
...your only competition for
my affections is our little girl.

1143
01:27:15,858 --> 01:27:20,195
I love you. I will always love you
and you alone.

1144
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:25,451
- You mean it today.
- Absolutely.

1145
01:27:26,285 --> 01:27:29,580
Which makes it so much harder
when you don't.

1146
01:27:39,256 --> 01:27:42,009
Is that more shopping?
She does love the smell of money.

1147
01:27:42,176 --> 01:27:45,512
The little lady wants to go to the zoo,
so I thought you could take her.

1148
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:48,765
Yeah? I mean,
I can do it tomorrow if not.

1149
01:27:48,932 --> 01:27:54,396
And Sarah, she knows.

1150
01:27:55,230 --> 01:27:58,442
She-- I mean, at least she knows
that something's not right...

1151
01:27:58,609 --> 01:28:02,070
...so if you can just do whatever
you can to help me with her.

1152
01:28:02,237 --> 01:28:06,200
Talk to her. Just convince her
that I do love her.

1153
01:28:17,169 --> 01:28:21,215
- What is it, Freddy?
- Just don't call me that, please.

1154
01:28:21,381 --> 01:28:23,926
It's nothing. It's just, you know,
there's sometimes...

1155
01:28:24,092 --> 01:28:26,386
- Sometimes it seems wrong.
- I've told you before...

1156
01:28:26,553 --> 01:28:28,138
...when you're with me,
you're with me.

1157
01:28:28,305 --> 01:28:30,557
Leave your family at home
where they belong.

1158
01:28:30,974 --> 01:28:32,434
I'm trying.

1159
01:28:32,601 --> 01:28:34,102
I'm trying, Olivia.

1160
01:28:34,269 --> 01:28:36,772
- I'll get dressed.
- Yeah.

1161
01:28:38,106 --> 01:28:40,943
I saw Fallon hanging around again.

1162
01:28:41,485 --> 01:28:43,612
There's something
about that man I don't trust.

1163
01:28:43,946 --> 01:28:46,782
You trust me? Then trust Fallon.

1164
01:28:47,282 --> 01:28:49,493
He protects the things
that I care about.

1165
01:29:27,823 --> 01:29:30,158
We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.

1166
01:29:30,325 --> 01:29:32,869
We were sorry to see
Mr. Tesla leave as well.

1167
01:29:33,036 --> 01:29:35,038
He was very good to Colorado Springs.

1168
01:29:35,539 --> 01:29:37,082
Mr. Angier...

1169
01:29:37,791 --> 01:29:41,503
...I didn't think it was necessary
to tell Edison's men about the box.

1170
01:29:42,129 --> 01:29:43,171
What box?

1171
01:30:08,655 --> 01:30:11,992
<i>I apologize for leaving
without saying goodbye...</i>

1172
01:30:12,451 --> 01:30:16,622
<i>...but I seem to have outstayed
my welcome in Colorado.</i>

1173
01:30:17,372 --> 01:30:21,835
<i>The truly extraordinary is not
permitted in science and industry.</i>

1174
01:30:22,002 --> 01:30:24,713
<i>Perhaps you'll find more luck
in your field...</i>

1175
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,424
<i>...where people are happy
to be mystified.</i>

1176
01:30:27,591 --> 01:30:31,511
<i>You will find what
you are looking for in this box.</i>

1177
01:30:31,928 --> 01:30:35,974
<i>Alley has written you
a thorough set of instructions.</i>

1178
01:30:36,141 --> 01:30:40,771
<i>I add only one suggestion
on using the machine:</i>

1179
01:30:40,937 --> 01:30:42,898
<i>Destroy it.</i>

1180
01:30:43,065 --> 01:30:46,151
<i>Drop it to the bottom
of the deepest ocean.</i>

1181
01:30:46,318 --> 01:30:49,529
<i>Such a thing
will bring you only misery.</i>

1182
01:30:53,575 --> 01:30:57,120
<i>Tesla's warning is as unheeded
as he knew it would be.</i>

1183
01:30:57,287 --> 01:30:59,247
<i>Today, I tested the machine...</i>

1184
01:30:59,414 --> 01:31:03,877
<i>...taking precautions in case Tesla hadn't
ironed out the kinks in its operation.</i>

1185
01:31:04,044 --> 01:31:08,882
<i>I mean, if it went wrong,
I would not wanna live like that for long.</i>

1186
01:31:27,526 --> 01:31:31,571
<i>But here at the Turn,
I must leave you, Borden.</i>

1187
01:31:31,738 --> 01:31:33,907
<i>Yes, you, Borden.</i>

1188
01:31:34,074 --> 01:31:36,284
<i>Sitting there in your cell...</i>

1189
01:31:36,451 --> 01:31:40,497
<i>...reading my diary,
awaiting your death...</i>

1190
01:31:40,664 --> 01:31:42,749
<i>...for my murder.</i>

1191
01:31:47,921 --> 01:31:51,133
Angier's journal, that gesture
of good faith, that's a fake.

1192
01:31:51,299 --> 01:31:52,467
I assure you, it's not.

1193
01:31:52,634 --> 01:31:55,303
The provenance of the journal
is clear and under no doubt.

1194
01:31:55,470 --> 01:32:00,016
And it's written in Angier's own hand,
of which we had numerous examples.

1195
01:32:01,977 --> 01:32:03,770
It don't matter.

1196
01:32:05,814 --> 01:32:08,734
So my tricks.

1197
01:32:11,111 --> 01:32:14,781
- All of them.
- Including The Transported Man?

1198
01:32:15,615 --> 01:32:17,909
Well, Lord Caldlow
will be very pleased indeed.

1199
01:32:18,076 --> 01:32:21,580
No, he won't.
Because they're not complete.

1200
01:32:21,747 --> 01:32:24,332
It's just the Pledge
and the Turn for each.

1201
01:32:24,499 --> 01:32:27,127
Without the Prestige for these tricks...

1202
01:32:27,711 --> 01:32:30,046
- ...these are worthless.
- Yeah.

1203
01:32:30,714 --> 01:32:34,176
You get the rest of it
when you bring my daughter here.

1204
01:32:37,053 --> 01:32:39,139
I wanna say goodbye.

1205
01:32:41,016 --> 01:32:42,350
We have to go through it now.

1206
01:32:42,517 --> 01:32:45,061
Listen, we have to go through it now.
Now, listen to me.

1207
01:32:45,228 --> 01:32:46,521
Deny it all you want.

1208
01:32:46,688 --> 01:32:48,982
Olivia means nothing.

1209
01:32:49,149 --> 01:32:50,525
- Olivia?
- I need an assistant.

1210
01:32:50,692 --> 01:32:51,860
No, I'll go to her.

1211
01:32:52,027 --> 01:32:53,695
- I'll tell her I know--
- Tell her what?

1212
01:32:53,862 --> 01:32:57,574
I know what you really are, Alfred. I...

1213
01:32:58,033 --> 01:32:59,993
- I know, and I--
- Sarah, Sarah.

1214
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:02,370
- I can't keep it in.
- You can't talk like this.

1215
01:33:02,537 --> 01:33:03,580
Sarah, shut up.

1216
01:33:03,747 --> 01:33:05,040
- No, no.
- Sarah, shut up!

1217
01:33:05,373 --> 01:33:07,042
I don't wanna hear it anymore!

1218
01:33:07,209 --> 01:33:10,212
You can't talk like this!

1219
01:33:11,922 --> 01:33:15,008
You can't hide it anymore
because I know, Alfred, I know.

1220
01:33:15,175 --> 01:33:16,885
I know what you really are!

1221
01:33:17,052 --> 01:33:18,720
Alfred...

1222
01:33:18,887 --> 01:33:21,598
...I can't live like this.

1223
01:33:21,765 --> 01:33:23,725
Oh, well, you think I can live like this?

1224
01:33:23,892 --> 01:33:27,062
You think I bloody enjoy
living like this?

1225
01:33:27,229 --> 01:33:29,815
- Stop it and listen! No!
- We have this beautiful house...

1226
01:33:29,981 --> 01:33:33,235
...lovely little girl, we're married.
What is so wrong with your life?

1227
01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:35,904
Alfred, I can't live like this!

1228
01:33:36,196 --> 01:33:38,949
Well, what do you want from me?

1229
01:33:43,578 --> 01:33:45,247
I want...

1230
01:33:45,413 --> 01:33:48,542
I want you to be honest with me.

1231
01:33:51,419 --> 01:33:53,255
No tricks...

1232
01:33:53,922 --> 01:33:57,300
...no lies...

1233
01:33:57,551 --> 01:34:00,720
...and no secrets.

1234
01:34:06,309 --> 01:34:09,646
Do you--? Do you love me?

1235
01:34:12,482 --> 01:34:14,234
Not today.

1236
01:34:16,236 --> 01:34:17,279
No.

1237
01:35:55,210 --> 01:35:57,212
Who's there?

1238
01:35:59,339 --> 01:36:01,132
I'm looking for an old friend.

1239
01:36:01,299 --> 01:36:03,176
I heard about a booking.

1240
01:36:03,343 --> 01:36:05,929
Nice little theater.
Good up-and-coming magician.

1241
01:36:06,096 --> 01:36:08,390
- You're back.
- It's good to see you, John.

1242
01:36:09,349 --> 01:36:11,935
Good rehearsal space.

1243
01:36:12,102 --> 01:36:14,729
Blind stagehands, I like it.

1244
01:36:14,896 --> 01:36:17,357
You always had
a good eye for publicity.

1245
01:36:17,524 --> 01:36:18,900
I need your help, John.

1246
01:36:19,401 --> 01:36:21,736
It's my last show.
A limited engagement.

1247
01:36:22,195 --> 01:36:23,446
Your last show?

1248
01:36:23,989 --> 01:36:27,409
A wise man once told me
obsession was a young man's game.

1249
01:36:27,575 --> 01:36:28,618
I'm almost done.

1250
01:36:29,577 --> 01:36:31,371
There's one thing left.

1251
01:36:32,414 --> 01:36:34,791
The Real Transported Man.

1252
01:36:36,710 --> 01:36:38,628
You wanna design a show around it.

1253
01:36:38,795 --> 01:36:41,589
I don't want you backstage.
I need you front of house, managing.

1254
01:36:41,756 --> 01:36:44,300
I need you to call in favors
or connections you have.

1255
01:36:44,467 --> 01:36:48,054
- Get us the right booking for the run.
- What sort of booking you after?

1256
01:36:48,221 --> 01:36:50,432
The sort that Borden can't ignore.

1257
01:36:58,481 --> 01:37:00,567
What an honor it is
to see you again, sir.

1258
01:37:00,734 --> 01:37:04,070
You said you only wanted to show me
one trick. It piqued my interest.

1259
01:37:04,237 --> 01:37:07,282
- It's a very clever trick, Mr. Ackerman.
- Pleased to meet you.

1260
01:37:07,449 --> 01:37:10,285
Likewise, I'm sure.
Well, let's get on, shall we?

1261
01:37:14,122 --> 01:37:16,124
Turn it on, gentlemen.

1262
01:37:21,004 --> 01:37:22,088
Very pretty.

1263
01:37:33,266 --> 01:37:36,686
That's it, Cutter?
He simply disappears?

1264
01:37:36,853 --> 01:37:39,689
That's not a trick.
Well, he has to come back.

1265
01:37:39,856 --> 01:37:40,940
There has to be a--

1266
01:37:41,107 --> 01:37:42,525
- A Prestige?
- Exactly.

1267
01:37:45,695 --> 01:37:47,489
Pardon me.

1268
01:37:48,281 --> 01:37:50,700
It's very rare to see...

1269
01:37:51,659 --> 01:37:53,578
...real magic.

1270
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:58,041
- It's been many years since I've seen--
- Are you interested in helping us?

1271
01:38:00,251 --> 01:38:01,711
Yes.

1272
01:38:02,337 --> 01:38:04,672
But you'll have to dress it up a little.

1273
01:38:06,299 --> 01:38:07,967
Disguise it.

1274
01:38:09,511 --> 01:38:12,013
Give them enough reason to doubt it.

1275
01:38:12,847 --> 01:38:16,059
You haven't spoken about her,
Freddy. Not once.

1276
01:38:16,226 --> 01:38:19,854
Why would I talk about her to you?

1277
01:38:20,021 --> 01:38:22,398
Because she was a part of your life.

1278
01:38:22,565 --> 01:38:23,733
And now she's gone.

1279
01:38:26,653 --> 01:38:30,949
The day before she killed herself,
she said she wanted to meet me.

1280
01:38:31,241 --> 01:38:34,202
That she had something
to tell me about you.

1281
01:38:34,369 --> 01:38:37,705
I was such a coward,
I couldn't bring myself to face her.

1282
01:38:37,872 --> 01:38:39,541
But...

1283
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:42,919
...what would she have said?

1284
01:38:43,086 --> 01:38:46,005
You wanna know the truth about me?

1285
01:38:47,132 --> 01:38:50,635
Truth is that...

1286
01:38:52,053 --> 01:38:54,055
...I never loved Sarah.

1287
01:38:55,682 --> 01:38:56,724
I never loved her.

1288
01:38:56,891 --> 01:39:00,228
- You married her, had a child with her.
- Yes, yes. Part of me.

1289
01:39:00,395 --> 01:39:04,107
Part of me did,
but the other part didn't.

1290
01:39:04,274 --> 01:39:07,610
The part that found you.
The part that's sitting here right now.

1291
01:39:08,695 --> 01:39:09,737
I love you.

1292
01:39:10,238 --> 01:39:13,616
No, Olivia, I love you. That's the truth.

1293
01:39:13,783 --> 01:39:16,202
That is the truth that matters.

1294
01:39:16,369 --> 01:39:20,582
You could be in some other restaurant
with some other woman right now...

1295
01:39:20,748 --> 01:39:22,375
...talking about me that way.

1296
01:39:22,542 --> 01:39:24,544
- No.
- Yes.

1297
01:39:27,922 --> 01:39:32,677
It's inhuman to be so cold.

1298
01:39:37,849 --> 01:39:41,644
He's back. After two years.

1299
01:39:41,811 --> 01:39:45,481
He's got a new trick. They're saying
it's the best London's ever seen.

1300
01:39:47,817 --> 01:39:51,237
You should see the look
on your face, Professor.

1301
01:39:52,197 --> 01:39:54,073
You should go to him.

1302
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,618
You two deserve each other.

1303
01:40:01,706 --> 01:40:05,501
I'm afraid I'm booked. Moscow Ballet,
they'll be playing through next year.

1304
01:40:05,668 --> 01:40:08,296
Then get rid of them.
There'll be a hundred performances.

1305
01:40:08,463 --> 01:40:10,131
No more, no less.

1306
01:40:10,298 --> 01:40:12,759
Five performances a week.
No matinees.

1307
01:40:14,636 --> 01:40:17,597
And that's what you'll be charging
for each ticket. Good day.

1308
01:40:40,370 --> 01:40:42,872
Ladies and gentlemen,
my first trick of the evening...

1309
01:40:43,039 --> 01:40:45,708
...is one that involves
considerable risk.

1310
01:40:46,167 --> 01:40:48,920
Anyone in the audience
who would be irrevocably damaged...

1311
01:40:49,087 --> 01:40:52,131
...by seeing a man drown
should leave now.

1312
01:40:52,298 --> 01:40:55,260
For when I tell you the young lady
who taught me this illusion...

1313
01:40:55,426 --> 01:40:57,011
...actually died performing it...

1314
01:40:57,178 --> 01:41:00,390
...you will understand the seriousness
of the dangers involved.

1315
01:41:02,642 --> 01:41:04,352
Let's begin.

1316
01:41:14,737 --> 01:41:18,116
In my travels, I have seen the future...

1317
01:41:19,242 --> 01:41:22,078
...and it is a strange future indeed.

1318
01:41:22,787 --> 01:41:24,872
The world, ladies and gentlemen...

1319
01:41:25,039 --> 01:41:29,252
...is on the brink of new
and terrifying possibilities.

1320
01:41:49,605 --> 01:41:54,068
What you're about to witness
is not magic.

1321
01:41:54,235 --> 01:41:55,695
It is purely science.

1322
01:41:56,070 --> 01:41:58,489
I would like to invite you
to come up on-stage now...

1323
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:01,576
...so that you can examine
the machine for yourselves.

1324
01:42:57,048 --> 01:43:00,218
Man's reach exceeds his imagination.

1325
01:43:00,385 --> 01:43:01,594
Bravo!

1326
01:43:04,555 --> 01:43:07,141
Bravo! Bravo!

1327
01:43:11,604 --> 01:43:14,148
Bravo. Bravo.

1328
01:43:22,407 --> 01:43:26,536
One hundred performances.
Why? Does his method dictate that?

1329
01:43:26,702 --> 01:43:28,621
Is it a publicity move? What is it?

1330
01:43:28,788 --> 01:43:31,165
He's a no-talent magician,
and they're calling him...

1331
01:43:31,332 --> 01:43:33,459
...the bloody best in England. Why?

1332
01:43:33,668 --> 01:43:36,337
Fifty yards in a second. In a second!

1333
01:43:36,504 --> 01:43:39,465
And all that we know
is he uses a trap door.

1334
01:43:39,632 --> 01:43:43,845
Brilliant. What is going on
under that stage? Huh?

1335
01:43:44,011 --> 01:43:46,806
Why can't you out think him?

1336
01:44:01,529 --> 01:44:06,367
They do this every night?
After each performance, yeah?

1337
01:44:36,772 --> 01:44:38,399
We're done.

1338
01:44:39,567 --> 01:44:40,985
All right?

1339
01:44:42,403 --> 01:44:44,071
Let him have his trick.

1340
01:44:44,238 --> 01:44:46,657
I don't need-- I don't need his secret.

1341
01:44:46,824 --> 01:44:48,409
So...

1342
01:44:49,744 --> 01:44:52,622
...don't go back there,
you leave him alone.

1343
01:44:52,830 --> 01:44:56,000
Both of us, just leave him alone.

1344
01:44:56,167 --> 01:44:57,627
We're done.

1345
01:45:06,594 --> 01:45:08,554
I told you, John...

1346
01:45:08,721 --> 01:45:10,640
...I don't want you backstage
on this one.

1347
01:45:12,517 --> 01:45:14,936
I would like to invite you
to come up on-stage now...

1348
01:45:15,102 --> 01:45:18,147
...so that you can examine
the machine for yourselves.

1349
01:45:46,634 --> 01:45:50,638
- Hey, where do you think you're going?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

1350
01:45:59,689 --> 01:46:01,482
Who was that?

1351
01:46:57,997 --> 01:46:59,040
Hey!

1352
01:46:59,206 --> 01:47:02,710
Where's the bloody key?
Where's the bloody key?

1353
01:47:05,338 --> 01:47:08,883
Where's the bloody key?
Bloody drowning!

1354
01:47:18,267 --> 01:47:20,227
Hold on!

1355
01:47:20,394 --> 01:47:21,854
Ah!

1356
01:47:24,649 --> 01:47:25,900
What have you done?

1357
01:47:47,838 --> 01:47:50,966
Alfred Borden,
you have been found guilty...

1358
01:47:51,133 --> 01:47:53,177
...of the murder of Robert Angier.

1359
01:47:53,344 --> 01:47:56,972
You will be hanged by the neck
until dead.

1360
01:47:57,765 --> 01:48:00,768
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

1361
01:48:02,395 --> 01:48:04,188
Mr. Cutter?

1362
01:48:04,939 --> 01:48:06,232
Owens.

1363
01:48:06,941 --> 01:48:09,110
Oh, thank you for coming, Mr. Owens.

1364
01:48:09,276 --> 01:48:13,572
It has fallen to me to dispose
of Mr. Angier's equipment.

1365
01:48:13,739 --> 01:48:15,491
But I noticed from this manifest...

1366
01:48:15,658 --> 01:48:18,953
...that Lord Caldlow
has purchased the bulk of the items.

1367
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:23,082
Mr. Cutter, if you need to know where
to deliver these items, surely you--

1368
01:48:23,249 --> 01:48:26,544
No, no. It's just
there is one particular item...

1369
01:48:26,711 --> 01:48:30,756
...this item, in fact,
that I would like to--

1370
01:48:30,923 --> 01:48:32,925
- You would like to...?
- Buy.

1371
01:48:33,092 --> 01:48:35,010
- Buy yourself?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

1372
01:48:36,262 --> 01:48:38,180
- This is the machine?
- Yes.

1373
01:48:38,347 --> 01:48:42,810
I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant
about purchasing this particular item.

1374
01:48:43,269 --> 01:48:45,980
Do you think I could talk
to Lord Caldlow in person?

1375
01:48:46,397 --> 01:48:48,816
Out of the question, I'm afraid.

1376
01:48:51,318 --> 01:48:53,112
Of course...

1377
01:48:53,279 --> 01:48:56,157
...I suppose if, in the course
of your delivery arrangements...

1378
01:48:56,323 --> 01:48:58,784
...your paths were to cross...

1379
01:48:59,201 --> 01:49:03,080
- ...I can't stop you speaking your mind.
- Thank you.

1380
01:49:04,623 --> 01:49:06,834
- Still here, Borden?
- For now.

1381
01:49:07,543 --> 01:49:08,836
Got a visitor.

1382
01:49:09,003 --> 01:49:10,379
Lord Caldlow.

1383
01:49:10,546 --> 01:49:12,631
With a little girl.

1384
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:22,725
Jess?

1385
01:49:22,892 --> 01:49:24,393
Hello, my love.

1386
01:49:25,102 --> 01:49:27,980
How are you? I've missed you so much.

1387
01:49:28,147 --> 01:49:30,191
And Fallon's missed you too.
We both have.

1388
01:49:30,357 --> 01:49:32,568
Daddy, can I come in there?

1389
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:35,696
Not right now. Not right now, darling.

1390
01:49:35,863 --> 01:49:39,408
No, but everything is gonna be all right.

1391
01:49:39,867 --> 01:49:42,536
- You must be Lord Caldlow.
- Caldlow.

1392
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:43,996
Yes, I am.

1393
01:49:44,163 --> 01:49:45,331
I always have been.

1394
01:49:50,377 --> 01:49:52,546
They flatter you
with all those chains, Alfred.

1395
01:49:52,713 --> 01:49:55,674
Don't they know you can't escape
without your little rubber ball?

1396
01:49:55,841 --> 01:49:56,967
I pulled you out.

1397
01:49:57,134 --> 01:49:58,677
Out of that tank.

1398
01:49:58,844 --> 01:50:02,515
All I wanted to do was prove
that I was a better magician...

1399
01:50:02,681 --> 01:50:04,558
...but you couldn't leave me alone.

1400
01:50:06,227 --> 01:50:08,395
I don't know what you've done...

1401
01:50:10,272 --> 01:50:13,776
...but you're not afraid to get
your hands dirty anymore, are you?

1402
01:50:13,943 --> 01:50:15,778
No, not anymore.

1403
01:50:15,945 --> 01:50:17,196
And I win.

1404
01:50:17,363 --> 01:50:20,533
Because no one cares about the man
in the box, the man who disappears.

1405
01:50:20,699 --> 01:50:21,742
You win?

1406
01:50:23,244 --> 01:50:27,665
This ain't a bloody competition anymore,
Angier, this is my little girl's life.

1407
01:50:27,832 --> 01:50:30,918
And don't you dare put her
in the middle of this.

1408
01:50:31,085 --> 01:50:33,921
Oh, I know how hard it is
to have someone so special...

1409
01:50:34,088 --> 01:50:36,715
...taken away from me,
don't I, Borden?

1410
01:50:37,550 --> 01:50:40,177
And you can't take her with you now,
can you?

1411
01:50:40,344 --> 01:50:42,096
Oh, she'll be looked after.

1412
01:50:42,638 --> 01:50:46,767
- Goodbye, Professor. Come on, darling.
- No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. Look.

1413
01:50:46,934 --> 01:50:48,269
Here.

1414
01:50:49,728 --> 01:50:51,438
That's what you're after.

1415
01:50:51,605 --> 01:50:53,732
That's what this is about.

1416
01:50:53,899 --> 01:50:55,150
Take it.

1417
01:50:55,317 --> 01:50:57,278
- Your secret?
- Yeah.

1418
01:51:00,281 --> 01:51:02,658
You always were the better magician.

1419
01:51:02,825 --> 01:51:04,326
We both know that.

1420
01:51:04,493 --> 01:51:06,996
But whatever your secret was,
I mean, you have to agree...

1421
01:51:08,414 --> 01:51:09,456
...mine is better.

1422
01:51:11,375 --> 01:51:14,587
Don't do this. Don't do this,
Angier, no. Jess, Jess, Jess.

1423
01:51:14,962 --> 01:51:18,132
Jess, I'm gonna take you home soon.
I promise.

1424
01:51:18,507 --> 01:51:20,801
- For God's sake, Borden.
- I promise. Look.

1425
01:51:24,763 --> 01:51:26,140
I promise.

1426
01:51:26,307 --> 01:51:29,977
- I love you, Jess. I love you.
- Come on.

1427
01:51:30,144 --> 01:51:33,314
- Come on. Come on.
- I love you. I love you, Jess.

1428
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:35,816
Angier. Angier!

1429
01:51:35,983 --> 01:51:37,985
What, you think this place
can hold me?

1430
01:51:38,152 --> 01:51:41,030
Angier! They're gonna
bloody hang me!

1431
01:51:41,196 --> 01:51:44,325
They're gonna bloody hang me!
You can put a stop to this now!

1432
01:51:44,491 --> 01:51:46,577
- Listen! Listen! That man--!
- Just shut up.

1433
01:51:46,744 --> 01:51:49,163
Listen, that man is the one
I'm meant to have killed!

1434
01:51:49,330 --> 01:51:51,290
You blind bastard, listen to me!

1435
01:51:51,457 --> 01:51:53,375
- If he's alive, I'm not guilty!
- Guards!

1436
01:51:53,542 --> 01:51:55,711
- I'm not guilty!
- I don't care! Get hold of him!

1437
01:51:55,878 --> 01:51:57,880
- Goodbye, Professor.
- Angier!

1438
01:52:02,635 --> 01:52:04,345
Run along now.

1439
01:52:05,304 --> 01:52:08,807
Sir. There's a gentleman waiting.

1440
01:52:24,657 --> 01:52:25,699
Dear God.

1441
01:52:26,492 --> 01:52:28,160
Hello, Cutter.

1442
01:52:28,744 --> 01:52:30,663
You're-- You're still alive.

1443
01:52:30,829 --> 01:52:32,581
How is it you're still alive, Robert?

1444
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:35,125
I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.

1445
01:52:38,170 --> 01:52:40,172
- Child.
- Good night, sir.

1446
01:52:40,339 --> 01:52:41,840
Good night, Jess.

1447
01:52:43,634 --> 01:52:45,135
I've seen her before.

1448
01:52:45,302 --> 01:52:50,599
I saw her in court with Fallon.

1449
01:52:52,476 --> 01:52:54,979
- What have you done?
- Well, she needs looking after.

1450
01:52:55,145 --> 01:52:57,398
She needs her father.

1451
01:52:57,815 --> 01:53:00,567
You're letting him hang,
and I helped you.

1452
01:53:00,734 --> 01:53:06,615
I came here to beg Lord Caldlow
to let me destroy that machine.

1453
01:53:07,157 --> 01:53:10,411
I am not gonna beg you for anything.

1454
01:53:10,577 --> 01:53:13,831
You don't have to. I'm gonna make sure
that machine's never used again.

1455
01:53:14,999 --> 01:53:19,253
Then, Lord Caldlow...

1456
01:53:20,754 --> 01:53:22,673
...where do you want me to deliver it?

1457
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:24,216
My theater.

1458
01:53:24,383 --> 01:53:26,510
It belongs with the Prestige materials.

1459
01:53:27,136 --> 01:53:29,638
John, I tried not to involve you.

1460
01:53:42,609 --> 01:53:44,486
So...

1461
01:53:46,822 --> 01:53:48,907
...we go alone now.

1462
01:53:49,575 --> 01:53:51,452
Both of us.

1463
01:53:54,872 --> 01:53:58,292
Only I don't have as far to go as you.

1464
01:54:03,547 --> 01:54:05,215
No.

1465
01:54:06,341 --> 01:54:09,720
You were right, I should have left him
to his damn trick.

1466
01:54:11,263 --> 01:54:13,015
I'm sorry.

1467
01:54:14,808 --> 01:54:17,186
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

1468
01:54:18,312 --> 01:54:20,481
I'm sorry about Sarah.

1469
01:54:22,149 --> 01:54:23,859
I didn't mean to hurt her.

1470
01:54:24,026 --> 01:54:25,986
I didn't.

1471
01:54:27,529 --> 01:54:30,240
You go live your life
in full now, all right?

1472
01:54:30,407 --> 01:54:31,950
You live for both of us.

1473
01:54:40,667 --> 01:54:42,211
Goodbye.

1474
01:55:28,507 --> 01:55:30,300
Are you watching closely?

1475
01:56:01,748 --> 01:56:03,750
Put it down the end.

1476
01:56:37,326 --> 01:56:41,496
Take a minute to consider
your achievement.

1477
01:56:41,914 --> 01:56:47,044
I once told you about a sailor
who described drowning to me.

1478
01:56:47,211 --> 01:56:49,296
Yes, he said it was like going home.

1479
01:56:50,339 --> 01:56:55,260
I was lying. He said it was agony.

1480
01:57:34,007 --> 01:57:35,968
Alfred Borden...

1481
01:57:36,343 --> 01:57:40,097
...this day, in the name of the king
and the High Court of England...

1482
01:57:40,264 --> 01:57:42,516
...you will meet your end.

1483
01:57:44,184 --> 01:57:47,104
No one cares about
the man in the box.

1484
01:57:51,191 --> 01:57:52,818
Cutter?

1485
01:57:57,531 --> 01:57:59,116
Cutter?

1486
01:58:00,909 --> 01:58:04,329
Do you have anything to say?

1487
01:58:07,874 --> 01:58:09,334
Abracadabra.

1488
01:58:45,954 --> 01:58:47,706
A brother.

1489
01:58:47,873 --> 01:58:49,207
A twin.

1490
01:58:50,375 --> 01:58:55,672
You were Fallon the whole time.

1491
01:58:55,839 --> 01:58:56,965
No.

1492
01:58:57,966 --> 01:59:01,595
We were both Fallon.
And we were both Borden.

1493
01:59:07,768 --> 01:59:10,687
Were you--? Were you the one
who went into the box...

1494
01:59:10,854 --> 01:59:12,647
...or the one who came back out?

1495
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:16,026
We took turns.

1496
01:59:20,906 --> 01:59:22,908
The trick is where we would swap.

1497
01:59:29,206 --> 01:59:30,749
Cutter knew. Cutter knew.

1498
01:59:30,916 --> 01:59:33,668
But I told him
it was too simple, too easy.

1499
01:59:34,836 --> 01:59:36,463
No.

1500
01:59:37,214 --> 01:59:39,091
Simple maybe, but not easy.

1501
01:59:39,466 --> 01:59:43,011
<i>There's nothing easy
about two men sharing one life.</i>

1502
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:48,600
Ah!

1503
01:59:48,767 --> 01:59:50,852
I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

1504
01:59:55,857 --> 01:59:58,026
What about Olivia? And your wife?

1505
01:59:58,985 --> 02:00:00,946
We each loved one of them.

1506
02:00:04,658 --> 02:00:06,660
<i>I loved Sarah.</i>

1507
02:00:07,702 --> 02:00:09,955
<i>He loved Olivia.</i>

1508
02:00:10,414 --> 02:00:15,544
We each had half of a full life, really,
which was enough for us.

1509
02:00:15,710 --> 02:00:17,504
Just.

1510
02:00:19,256 --> 02:00:21,091
But not for them.

1511
02:00:23,718 --> 02:00:28,432
See, sacrifice, Robert,
that's the price of a good trick.

1512
02:00:30,934 --> 02:00:33,687
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

1513
02:00:37,190 --> 02:00:38,483
I've made sacrifices.

1514
02:00:38,650 --> 02:00:40,402
- No.
- Yes.

1515
02:00:41,027 --> 02:00:43,989
It takes nothing
to steal another man's work.

1516
02:00:45,198 --> 02:00:46,783
It takes everything.

1517
02:01:06,887 --> 02:01:09,014
No. No.
No, wait! I'm the--!

1518
02:01:16,062 --> 02:01:18,190
It took courage.

1519
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:23,528
It took courage to climb
into that machine every night...

1520
02:01:24,362 --> 02:01:29,326
...not knowing
if I'd be the man in the box...

1521
02:01:32,204 --> 02:01:33,246
...or in the Prestige.

1522
02:01:35,081 --> 02:01:39,711
Do you wanna--?
Do you wanna see what it cost me?

1523
02:01:40,170 --> 02:01:43,298
You didn't see where you are, did you?

1524
02:01:43,924 --> 02:01:46,092
Look. Look.

1525
02:01:47,135 --> 02:01:49,221
I don't care.

1526
02:01:53,517 --> 02:01:56,144
You went halfway around the world.

1527
02:01:57,145 --> 02:02:00,106
You spent a fortune.

1528
02:02:01,942 --> 02:02:04,277
You did terrible things.

1529
02:02:05,445 --> 02:02:08,281
Really terrible things, Robert.

1530
02:02:10,033 --> 02:02:11,451
And all for nothing.

1531
02:02:12,702 --> 02:02:15,413
- For nothing?
- Yeah.

1532
02:02:18,792 --> 02:02:23,547
You never understood why we did this.

1533
02:02:26,466 --> 02:02:29,719
The audience knows the truth.

1534
02:02:30,303 --> 02:02:34,307
The world is simple. It's miserable.

1535
02:02:36,101 --> 02:02:38,603
Solid all the way through.

1536
02:02:40,522 --> 02:02:45,110
But if you could fool them,
even for a second...

1537
02:02:46,653 --> 02:02:49,364
...then you could make them wonder.

1538
02:02:50,198 --> 02:02:52,033
And then you...

1539
02:02:52,492 --> 02:02:56,955
Then you got to see something
very special.

1540
02:03:00,834 --> 02:03:03,086
You really don't know?

1541
02:03:06,756 --> 02:03:12,053
It was-- It was the look on their faces.

1542
02:03:27,235 --> 02:03:32,240
<i>Every magic trick consists
of three parts or acts.</i>

1543
02:03:35,535 --> 02:03:38,747
<i>The first part is called the Pledge.</i>

1544
02:03:39,164 --> 02:03:41,833
<i>The magician shows you
something ordinary.</i>

1545
02:03:43,001 --> 02:03:46,713
<i>The second act is called the Turn.</i>

1546
02:03:46,963 --> 02:03:50,050
<i>The magician takes
the ordinary something...</i>

1547
02:03:50,216 --> 02:03:53,178
<i>...and makes it into
something extraordinary.</i>

1548
02:03:54,471 --> 02:03:56,222
<i>But you wouldn't clap yet...</i>

1549
02:03:56,389 --> 02:03:59,476
<i>...because making something
disappear isn't enough.</i>

1550
02:04:00,101 --> 02:04:03,605
<i>You have to bring it back.</i>

1551
02:04:07,359 --> 02:04:09,027
Hey.

1552
02:04:37,013 --> 02:04:40,100
<i>Now you're looking for the secret.</i>

1553
02:04:42,352 --> 02:04:47,273
<i>But you won't find it because,
of course, you're not really looking.</i>

1554
02:04:49,275 --> 02:04:52,362
<i>You don't really want to work it out.</i>

1555
02:04:55,448 --> 02:04:57,742
<i>You want to be fooled.</i>
