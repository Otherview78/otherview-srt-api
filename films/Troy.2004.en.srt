1
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:40,015
Men are haunted
by the vastness of eternity.

2
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,434
And so we ask ourselves...

3
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,772
...will our actions echo
across the centuries?

4
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,860
Will strangers hear our names
long after we're gone...

5
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,363
...and wonder who we were...

6
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,865
...how bravely we fought...

7
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,952
...how fiercely we loved?

8
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,272
Good day for the crows.

9
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,692
Remove your army from my land.

10
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,694
I like your land.

11
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,406
I think we'll stay.
I like your soldiers too.

12
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,116
They won't fight for you.

13
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,327
That's what the Messenians said.

14
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,497
And the Arcadians and the Epeians.

15
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,667
Now they all fight for me.

16
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,378
You can't have the whole world,
Agamemnon.

17
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,880
It's too big, even for you.

18
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,716
I don't want to watch another massacre.

19
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:25,597
Let's settle this war in the old manner.
Your best fighter against my best.

20
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,434
And if my man wins?

21
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,561
We'll leave Thessaly for good.

22
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,023
Boagrius!

23
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,378
Achilles!

24
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,514
Boagrius has this effect on many heroes.

25
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,767
Careful who you insult, old king.

26
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,316
My king, Achilles is not with the army.

27
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,235
- Where is he?
- I sent a boy to look for him.

28
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,222
I was having a good dream.

29
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,809
Very good dream.

30
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,147
King Agamemnon sent me. He needs to...

31
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,483
I'll speak to your king in the morning.

32
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,651
But, my lord, it is morning.

33
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,157
They're waiting for you.

34
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,125
Are the stories about you true?

35
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,755
They say your mother
is an immortal goddess.

36
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,050
They say you can't be killed.

37
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,053
I wouldn't be bothering
with the shield then, would I?

38
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,555
The Thessalonian you're fighting...

39
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:35,060
...he's the biggest man I've ever seen.
I wouldn't want to fight him.

40
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,981
That's why no one will remember
your name.

41
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:08,218
Perhaps we should have our war
tomorrow, when you're better rested.

42
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,929
I should have you whipped
for your impudence!

43
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,852
- Perhaps you should fight him.
- Achilles.

44
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,438
Achilles.

45
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,985
Look at the men's faces.
You can save hundreds of them.

46
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,905
You can end this war
with a swing of your sword.

47
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,366
Let them go home to their wives.

48
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:41,835
Imagine a king who fights his
own battles. Wouldn't that be a sight.

49
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,968
Of all the warlords loved by the gods,
I hate him the most.

50
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,024
Is there no one else?

51
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,578
Who are you, soldier?

52
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,541
Achilles. Son of Peleus.

53
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:07,379
Achilles?
I'll remember the name.

54
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,925
The ruler of Thessaly carries this scepter.

55
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,053
Give it to your king.

56
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,181
He's not my king.

57
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,828
Brothers in arms!

58
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,205
- Friendship!
- Friendshiр!

59
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,174
Princes of Troy,
on our last night together...

60
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,844
...Queen Helen and I salute you.

61
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,932
We've had our conflicts before, it's true.

62
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,352
We fought many battles,
Sparta and Troy. And fought well!

63
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,024
But I have always respected your father.

64
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,735
Priam is a good king, a good man.

65
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:15,947
I respected him as an adversary.
I respect him now as my ally.

66
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,869
Hector, Paris,
young princes, come. Stand.

67
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,746
Drink with me.

68
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,625
Let us drink to peace.

69
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,046
To peace between Troy and Sparta.

70
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,551
May the gods keep the wolves
in the hills and the women in our beds.

71
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,488
Ah!

72
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,412
- For the gods.
- For the gods.

73
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,708
You shouldn't be here.

74
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,293
That's what you said last night.

75
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,964
Last night was a mistake.

76
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,218
And the night before?

77
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,805
I've made many mistakes this week.

78
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,238
Do you want me to go?

79
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,201
Pearls from the Sea of Propontis.

80
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,336
They're beautiful.

81
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,006
But I can't wear them.

82
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,343
Menelaus would kill us both.

83
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,263
Don't be afraid of him.

84
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,517
I'm not afraid of dying.

85
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,522
I'm afraid of tomorrow.

86
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:42,946
I'm afraid of watching you sail away
and knowing you'll never come back.

87
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,247
Before you came to Sparta,
I was a ghost.

88
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,209
I walked, and I ate,
and I swam in the sea...

89
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,462
...but I was just a ghost.

90
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,631
You don't have to fear tomorrow.

91
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,843
Come with me.

92
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,683
Don't play with me. Don't play.

93
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,020
If you come, we'll never be safe.

94
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,858
Men will hunt us, the gods will curse us.

95
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,277
But I'll love you.

96
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,614
Till the day they burn my body...

97
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,450
...I will love you.

98
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:55,643
A beautiful morning.
Poseidon has blessed our voyage.

99
00:14:56,312 --> 00:15:00,315
Sometimes the gods bless you in the
morning and curse you in the afternoon.

100
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,066
Drop sail!

101
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,321
Do you love me, brother?

102
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,949
Would you protect me
against any enemy?

103
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,163
The last time you spoke to me like this...

104
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,666
...you were 10 years old,
and you'd just stolen Father's horse.

105
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,045
What have you done now?

106
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,380
I must show you something.

107
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,536
Where is she?

108
00:15:55,996 --> 00:16:00,166
I swear by the father of the gods,
I will gut you here if you don't tell me!

109
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,126
My king!

110
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,923
She left. With the Trojans.

111
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,886
The fisherman here saw her
board their ship.

112
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,639
The Trojans?

113
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,643
With the young prince, Paris. She...

114
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,605
Get my ship ready.

115
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,234
Turn us round. Back to Sparta.

116
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,735
High on the sail!

117
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,404
- Wait, wait.
- You fool!

118
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,906
- Listen to me.
- Do you know what you've done?

119
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,493
Do you know how many years our father
worked for peace?

120
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,912
- I love her.
- Ah!

121
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,999
It's all a game to you, isn't it?

122
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,961
You roam from town to town, bedding
merchants' wives and temple maids.

123
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,213
You think you know
something about love.

124
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,881
What about your father's love?

125
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,676
You spat on him when you
brought her on this ship!

126
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,805
What about the love for your country?
You'd let Troy burn for this woman?

127
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,769
I won't let you start a war for her.

128
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,438
May I speak?

129
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,898
What you're saying is true.

130
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,693
I've wronged you.
I've wronged our father.

131
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,946
If you want to take Helen
back to Sparta, so be it.

132
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,449
But I go with her.

133
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,868
To Sparta? They'll kill you.

134
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,370
Then I'll die fighting.

135
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:23,124
Oh, and that sounds heroic to you,
doesn't it? To die fighting.

136
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,773
Little brother, have you ever killed a man?

137
00:17:25,773 --> 00:17:26,437
No.

138
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,463
- Ever seen a man die in combat?
- No.

139
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,967
I've killed men, and I've heard them
dying. And I've watched them dying.

140
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,928
And there's nothing glorious about it.
Nothing poetic.

141
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,307
You say you want to die for love.
You know nothing about dying.

142
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,726
And you know nothing about love!

143
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,812
All the same, I go with her.

144
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,148
I won't ask you to fight my war.

145
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,195
You already have.

146
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,698
To Troy!

147
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,868
About ship! Set sail!

148
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:37,115
- I want her back.
- Well, of course you do.

149
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,866
She's a beautiful woman.

150
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,703
I want her back so I can kill her
with my own two hands.

151
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,124
I won't rest till I've burned Troy
to the ground.

152
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,417
I thought you wanted peace with Troy.

153
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,461
I should have listened to you.

154
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,880
Peace is for the women...

155
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,299
...and the weak.

156
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,637
Empires are forged by war.

157
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,683
All my life, I've stood by your side,
fought your enemies.

158
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,812
You're the elder, you reap the glory.
This is the way of the world.

159
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,524
But have I ever complained?
Have I ever asked you for anything?

160
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,485
Never. You're a man of honor.

161
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,406
Will you go to war with me, brother?

162
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,920
I always thought my
brother's wife was a foolish woman...

163
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,256
...but she's proved to be very useful.

164
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,759
The Trojans have never been conquered.

165
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,554
Some say they can't be conquered.

166
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:46,058
Old King Priam thinks he's untouchable
behind his high walls.

167
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,228
He thinks the sun god will protect him.

168
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,981
But the gods protect only...

169
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,775
...the strong!

170
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,778
If Troy falls...

171
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,157
...I control the Aegean.

172
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,035
Hector commands the finest army
in the east.

173
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,663
I'll attack them with the greatest force
the world has ever seen.

174
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:11,042
I want all the kings of Greece
and their armies.

175
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,002
Send emissaries in the morning.

176
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,921
One last thing.

177
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,507
We need Achilles and his Myrmidons.

178
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,136
Achilles.

179
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,934
He can't be controlled.
He's as likely to fight us as the Trojans.

180
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:31,520
We don't need to control him,
we need to unleash him.

181
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,649
That man was born to end lives.

182
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:39,237
Yes, he's a gifted killer.
But he threatens everything I've built.

183
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,280
Before me, Greece was nothing.

184
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,824
I brought all
the Greek kingdoms together.

185
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,954
I created a nation out of fire worshipers
and snake eaters!

186
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,873
I build the future, Nestor. Me!

187
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,127
Achilles is the past.

188
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:59,632
A man who fights for no flag.
A man loyal to no country.

189
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,344
How many battles have we won
off the edge of his sword?

190
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,764
This will be the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

191
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,350
We need the greatest warrior.

192
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,065
There's only one man he'll listen to.

193
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,709
Never hesitate.

194
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,221
Nervous?

195
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,642
Petrified.

196
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,813
You told me never
to change sword hands.

197
00:21:56,356 --> 00:22:00,109
Yes. When you know how to
use it, you won't be taking my orders.

198
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:23,341
Your reputation for hospitality
is fast becoming legend.

199
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,015
Patroclus, my cousin.

200
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,517
Odysseus, king of Ithaca.

201
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,521
Patroclus. I knew your parents well.

202
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,190
I miss them.

203
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,694
Now you have this one
watching over you, eh?

204
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,364
Learning from Achilles himself.

205
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,075
Kings would kill for the honor.

206
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,952
Are you here at Agamemnon's bidding?

207
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,288
We need to talk.

208
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,877
I will not fight for him.

209
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,130
I'm not asking you to fight for him.

210
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,967
I'm asking you to fight for the Greeks.

211
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,470
Why? Are the Greeks tired of fighting
each other?

212
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,848
- For now.
- The Trojans never harmed me.

213
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,767
They insulted Greece.

214
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,979
They insulted a man who couldn't hold
on to his wife. Is that my business?

215
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,482
Your business is war, my friend.

216
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,692
Is it? The man has no honor.

217
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,238
Let Achilles fight for honor.
Let Agamemnon fight for power.

218
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,449
And let the gods decide
which man to glorify.

219
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,411
- For the Greeks!
- Forget Agamemnon.

220
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,371
Fight for me.

221
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,083
My wife will feel much better
if she knows you're by my side.

222
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,709
I'll feel much better.

223
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,006
We're sending the largest fleet
that ever sailed.

224
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,675
A thousand ships.

225
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,636
Prince Hector. Is he as good a warrior
as they say?

226
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,264
The best of all the Troyans.

227
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,143
Some say he's better
than all the Greeks too.

228
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,311
Even if your cousin doesn't come...

229
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,149
...I hope you'll join us.
we could use a strong arm like yours.

230
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,569
Play your tricks on me,
but not my cousin.

231
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,905
You have your swords. I have my tricks.

232
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,200
We play with the toys the gods give us.

233
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,871
We sail for Troy in three days.

234
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,335
This war will never be forgotten.

235
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,589
Nor will the heroes who fight in it.

236
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,745
I knew they would come for you.

237
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,873
Long before you were born...

238
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,542
...I knew they would come.

239
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,378
They want you to fight in Troy.

240
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,720
I'm making you
another seashell necklace.

241
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,723
Like the ones I made you
when you were a boy.

242
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,308
Do you remember?

243
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,605
Mother...

244
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,401
...tonight, I decide.

245
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,612
If you stay in Larisa...

246
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,532
...you will find peace.

247
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,617
You will find a wonderful woman.

248
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,079
You will have sons and daughters,
and they will have children.

249
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,456
And they will love you.

250
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,292
When you are gone,
they will remember you.

251
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,925
But when your children are dead
and their children after them...

252
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,136
...your name will be lost.

253
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,308
If you go to Troy...

254
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,645
...glory will be yours.

255
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:10,818
They will write stories about your
victories for thousands of years.

256
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,655
The world will remember your name.

257
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,616
But if you go to Troy...

258
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,371
...you will never come home.

259
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:27,501
For your glory walks hand in hand
with your doom.

260
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,172
And I shall never see you again.

261
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,647
- My son.
- Father.

262
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,946
Paris.

263
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,911
Father.

264
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,582
- This is Helen.
- Helen?

265
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,168
Helen of Sparta?

266
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,920
Helen of Troy.

267
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,675
I've heard rumors of your beauty.

268
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,512
For once...

269
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,015
...the gossips were right.

270
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,560
Welcome.

271
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,772
Come, you must be tired.

272
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,119
Look.

273
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,999
- He's grown.
- He is strong.

274
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,710
- Briseis!
- Paris!

275
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,218
Beloved cousin, your beauty grows
with each new moon.

276
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,929
Briseis.

277
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,265
A servant of Apollo now.

278
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:14,228
The young men of Troy were devastated
when Briseis chose the virgin robes.

279
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,209
Father...

280
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,962
...I know this is the last thing we need.

281
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:44,675
It is the will of the gods.
Everything is in their hands.

282
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:49,680
- But I'm surprised you let him bring her.
- If I'd let him fight Menelaus for her...

283
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,975
...you'd be burning a son's body,
not welcoming a daughter.

284
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,727
We could send peace envoys
to Menelaus.

285
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,730
You know Menelaus.
He'd spear their heads to his gate.

286
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,858
What would you have me do?

287
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:04,403
Put her on a ship and send her home.

288
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,617
Women have always loved Paris,
and he has loved them back.

289
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,411
But this is different.

290
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,913
Something has changed in him.

291
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,917
If we send her home to Menelaus,
he will follow her.

292
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,880
This is my country,
and these are my countrymen.

293
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,508
I don't want to see them suffer
so my brother can have his prize.

294
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,595
It's not just the Spartans
coming after her.

295
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,055
By now, Menelaus has gone
to Agamemnon.

296
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,892
And Agamemnon has wanted
to destroy us for years.

297
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:39,897
Enemies have been attacking us
for centuries. Our walls still stand.

298
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,609
Father, we can't win this war.

299
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,820
Apollo watches over us.

300
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,574
Even Agamemnon
is no match for the gods.

301
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,493
And how many battalions
does the sun god command?

302
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,120
Do not mock the gods.

303
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,003
They're coming for me.

304
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,256
The wind is bringing them closer.

305
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,091
What if we left?

306
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,427
Tonight. Right now.

307
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:15,098
What if we went down to the stables,
took two horses and left?

308
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,225
Ride east, keep riding.

309
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,604
- And go where?
- Away from here.

310
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,566
I could hunt deer, rabbit. I could feed us.

311
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,862
But this is your home.

312
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,156
You left your home for me.

313
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,537
Sparta was never my home.

314
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,999
My parents sent my there when I was 16
to marry Menelaus.

315
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,001
But it was never my home.

316
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,920
We'll live off the land.

317
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,715
No more palaces for us. No more
servants. We don't need any of that.

318
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,217
And your family?

319
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:54,221
We'd be protecting my family. If we're
not here, what's the need for war?

320
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:58,183
Menelaus won't give up.
He'll track us to the end of the world.

321
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:02,312
He doesn't know these lands. I do.
we can lose ourselves in a day.

322
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,191
You don't know Menelaus.
You don't know his brother.

323
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,861
They'll burn every house in Troy
to find us.

324
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,156
They'll never believe we've left.

325
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:17,494
And even if they do,
they'll burn it for spite.

326
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,333
Then I'll make it easy for him to find me.

327
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,672
I'll walk right up to him
and tell him you're mine.

328
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,013
You're very young, my love.

329
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,249
Look at that.

330
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,640
Take up your positions!

331
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,711
My lord?

332
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,381
Should we wait for the others?

333
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,635
- They brought us here for war.
- Yes, but Agamemnon's orders...

334
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,263
You fight for me, Eudorus,
or Agamemnon?

335
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,764
For you, my lord.

336
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:29,352
Then fight for me. And let the servants
of Agamemnon fight for him.

337
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,941
Black sail.

338
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,818
It's Achilles.

339
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,528
What's the fool doing?

340
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,573
He's going to take the beach of Troy
with 50 men?

341
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,081
Make way there! Make way!

342
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,387
Tecton, is the Apollonian Guard ready?

343
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,891
- Waiting at the city gates.
- Good. I'll be right there.

344
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,519
Lysander, how long
before the army is ready?

345
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,898
Half of our men are still coming.
we have to arm them...

346
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,566
- How long?
- Noon.

347
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,360
Make it sooner.

348
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,165
Patroclus!

349
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,711
Put down your spear.

350
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,964
- I'm fighting the Trojans.
- Not today.

351
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,132
I'm ready. You taught me how to fight.

352
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:45,220
And you're a good student.
But you're not a Myrmidon yet.

353
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,473
Look at these men.

354
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:53,144
They are the fiercest soldiers in all
of Greece. Each of them has bled for me.

355
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,313
- Guard the ship.
- But this is a war.

356
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:59,651
Cousin, I can't fight the Trojans
if I'm concerned for you. Guard the ship.

357
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,674
Trojans!

358
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,430
All my life, I've lived by a code.

359
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,932
And the code is simple:

360
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,935
Honor the gods, love your woman...

361
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,104
...and defend your country.

362
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,400
Troy is mother to us all.

363
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,319
Fight for her!

364
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,715
Myrmidons...

365
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,301
...my brothers of the sword.

366
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:11,181
I'd rather fight beside you
than any army of thousands.

367
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,601
Let no man forget how menacing we are.
we are lions!

368
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:23,276
Do you know what's there, waiting,
beyond that beach?

369
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,613
Immortality! Take it! It's yours!

370
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,628
Fight positions!

371
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,840
Archers!

372
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,152
Forward!

373
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,344
The man wants to die.

374
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,199
On my command!

375
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,167
Break off! Break off!

376
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,082
Look at him.

377
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,210
Look.

378
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,380
Row, you lazy whores, row!

379
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,468
Greeks are dying! Row!

380
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:24,123
Those men down there need help. Now!
Tecton, with me.

381
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,885
Flank! To the flank!

382
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:21,097
Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!
Achilles!

383
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:56,215
Back to the city! Back to the city!

384
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:07,435
The sun god is a patron of Troy,
our enemy.

385
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,396
Take whatever treasure you can find.

386
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,195
With your permission, my lord.

387
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:25,078
- Speak.
- Apollo sees everything.

388
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:28,039
Perhaps it is not wise to offend him.

389
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,230
Warn the men.

390
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,024
Wait.

391
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,954
You are very brave or
very stupid to come after me alone.

392
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,957
You must be Hector.

393
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:42,924
Do you know who I am?

394
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:44,926
These priests weren't armed.

395
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,140
Fight me!

396
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,857
Why kill you now, prince of Troy...

397
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,026
...with no one here to see you fall?

398
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,288
Why did you come here?

399
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,208
They'll be talking about this war
for 1000 years.

400
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:20,378
In 1000 years, the dust
from our bones will be gone.

401
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,922
Yes, prince. But our names will remain.

402
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:37,687
Go home, prince. Drink some wine,
make love to your wife.

403
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,605
Tomorrow, we'll have our war.

404
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,485
You speak of war as if it's a game.

405
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,364
How many wives wait at Troy's gates
for husbands they'll never see again?

406
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,116
Your brother can comfort them.

407
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,452
I hear he's good at charming
other men's wives.

408
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,374
Psst.

409
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,384
My lord, you let him go?

410
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,307
It's too early in the day
for killing princes.

411
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,883
Achilles! Achilles!

412
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,626
- Achilles.
- Ajax.

413
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:28,756
You're as fearless as the gods.
I'm honored to go to war with you.

414
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,341
As am I.

415
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,636
If you sailed slower,
the war would be over.

416
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,472
I'll miss the start as long as I'm here
at the end.

417
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,018
I've got something to show you.

418
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:02,248
The men found her hiding in the temple.

419
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:03,958
They thought she'd...

420
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,752
...amuse you.

421
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:19,682
What's your name?

422
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,688
Did you not hear me?

423
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,774
You killed Apollo's priests.

424
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,569
I've killed men in five countries,
never a priest.

425
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,612
Well, then your men did.

426
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,781
The sun god will have his vengeance.

427
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,285
- What's he waiting for?
- The right time to strike.

428
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,623
His priests are dead,
and his acolyte's a captive.

429
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,460
- I think your god is afraid of me.
- Afraid?

430
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,796
Apollo is master of the sun.
He fears nothing.

431
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,632
- Where is he?
- You're nothing but a killer!

432
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,552
You wouldn't know anything
about the gods.

433
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:01,307
I know more about the gods
than your priests.

434
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,476
I've seen them.

435
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,608
You're royalty, aren't you?

436
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,738
Spent years talking down to men.

437
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,577
You must be royalty.

438
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,247
What's your name?

439
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,714
Even the servants of Apollo have names.

440
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,344
Briseis.

441
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,931
Are you afraid, Briseis?

442
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,517
Should I be?

443
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,688
My lord.

444
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,610
Agamemnon requests your presence.

445
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,072
The kings are gathering
to celebrate the victory.

446
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,243
You fought well today.

447
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,371
My lord.

448
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:12,461
What do you want here in Troy?

449
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,464
You didn't come
for the Spartan queen.

450
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,383
I want what all men want.

451
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,552
I just want it more.

452
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,060
You don't need to fear me, girl.

453
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,272
You're the only Trojan who can say that.

454
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:06,640
You have won a great victory,
my king of kings.

455
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:11,770
No one thought the Trojan beach
could be captured so easily.

456
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,648
A beautiful gift, Triopas.

457
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:20,529
You will be among the first to walk
in the streets of Troy tomorrow.

458
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:28,537
My father, Neleus, had this urn made to
commemorate his victory at Cyparisseis.

459
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,539
I present it to you...

460
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,626
...in honor of an even more
memorable victory.

461
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,461
Thank you, old friend.

462
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:39,965
Tomorrow, we'll eat supper
in the gardens of Troy.

463
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,556
Leave us.

464
00:53:55,774 --> 00:54:00,319
War is young men dying and old men
talking. You know this.

465
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,571
Ignore the politics.

466
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,840
Apparently, you won some great victory.

467
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:27,805
Perhaps you didn't notice. The Trojan
beach belonged to Priam in the morning.

468
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:30,849
It belongs to Agamemnon
in the afternoon.

469
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,227
Have the beach.
I didn't come here for sand.

470
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,812
No.

471
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,816
You came here because you want
your name to last through the ages.

472
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,861
A great victory was won today.

473
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,781
But that victory is not yours.

474
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,492
Kings did not kneel to Achilles.

475
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:51,704
Kings did not pay homage to Achilles.

476
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:55,541
Perhaps the kings were too far behind
to see. Soldiers won the battle.

477
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,043
History remembers kings!

478
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:00,254
Not soldiers.

479
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,883
Tomorrow, we'll batter down
the gates of Troy.

480
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,803
I'll build monuments
on every island of Greece.

481
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:11,307
I'll carve "Agamemnon" in the stone.

482
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:15,394
Be careful, king of kings.
First, you need the victory.

483
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,443
Your men sacked the temple
of Apollo, yes?

484
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,361
You want gold? Take it.

485
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:27,531
It's my gift to honor your courage.
Take what you wish.

486
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,616
I already have.

487
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,704
Aphareus!

488
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,706
Haemon!

489
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,799
The spoils of war.

490
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:50,012
No argument with you, but if you don't
release her, you'll never see home again.

491
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,723
- Decide.
- Guards!

492
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,768
Stop!

493
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,105
Too many men have died today.

494
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,611
If killing is your only talent,
that's your curse.

495
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,573
I don't want anyone dying for me.

496
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:22,252
Mighty Achilles, silenced by a slave girl.

497
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:27,174
Tonight, I'll have her give me a bath.

498
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,260
And then...

499
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,764
- ...who knows?
- You sack of wine!

500
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:40,771
Before my time is done, I will look
down on your corpse and smile.

501
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:58,622
If they want a war,
we will give them a war.

502
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:04,962
I would match the best of Troy
against the best of Greece any day.

503
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:09,633
The best of Greece outnumber
the best of Troy two to one.

504
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,678
Glaucus.

505
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:16,932
You have fought with me for 40 years.
Can we win this war?

506
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,852
Our walls have never been breached.

507
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:24,690
We have the finest archers in the world.
And we have Hector.

508
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,693
Yes, we can win.

509
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,909
I spoke to two farmers today.

510
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:41,331
They saw an eagle flying
with a serpent clutched in its talons.

511
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,043
This is a sign from Apollo.

512
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,421
We will win a great victory tomorrow.

513
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,173
Bird signs.

514
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:52,217
You want to plan a strategy
based on bird signs.

515
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:57,097
Hector, show respect.
The high priest is a servant of the gods.

516
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,641
And I am a servant of Troy.

517
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,020
I've always honored the gods, Father.

518
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:07,274
But today I fought a Greek
who desecrated the statue of Apollo.

519
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,568
Apollo didn't strike the man down.

520
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,322
The gods won't fight this war for us.

521
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,365
There won't be a war.

522
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,331
This is not a conflict of nations.

523
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,791
It is a dispute between two men.

524
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,462
I don't want to see another Trojan die
because of me.

525
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,339
Paris.

526
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:35,177
Tomorrow morning, I will challenge
Menelaus for the right to Helen.

527
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:39,806
The winner will take her home.
The loser will burn before nightfall.

528
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,619
Father...

529
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:04,498
...I'm sorry for the pain I've caused you.

530
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,209
Do you love her?

531
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:14,132
You are a great king because you love
your country so much.

532
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,510
Every blade of grass.

533
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,471
Every grain of sand.

534
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,223
Every rock in the river.

535
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,560
You love all of Troy.

536
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,273
That is the way I love Helen.

537
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,821
I've fought many wars in my time.

538
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,784
Some were fought for land,
some for power, some for glory.

539
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:48,375
I suppose fighting for love makes
more sense than all the rest.

540
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,420
But I won't be the one fighting.

541
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,508
The sword of Troy.

542
00:59:57,218 --> 01:00:00,887
My father carried this sword,
and his father before him...

543
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,682
...all the way back
to the founding of Troy.

544
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,978
The history of our people
was written with this sword.

545
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,524
Carry it with you tomorrow.

546
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:19,072
The spirit of Troy is in that sword.

547
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:23,493
So long as a Troyan carries it...

548
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,663
...our people have a future.

549
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:33,754
The man who killed Tecton
outside Apollo's temple...

550
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,466
...I've never seen a spear
thrown like that.

551
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,510
An impossible throw.

552
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,643
Don't go tomorrow.

553
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,396
- Please don't go.
- Paris fights tomorrow, not me.

554
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,565
Fifty thousand Greeks
didn't cross the sea...

555
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,985
...to watch your brother fight.
You know this.

556
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,029
You'd make a fine general, my love.

557
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:03,909
You've been fighting your whole life.
Let other men do battle this time.

558
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:08,789
You know I don't want to fight.
I want to see my son grow tall.

559
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:11,458
I want to see the girls chasing after him.

560
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,544
I can't lose you.

561
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,923
I won't survive.

562
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,649
I must see Paris.

563
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,075
Wait.

564
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,494
Wait!

565
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,334
Helen, what are you doing?

566
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:56,628
- Let me go.
- No.

567
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,012
I saw them burn.

568
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,975
I saw them burning on the pyres.

569
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,854
That's my fault.

570
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,357
It is. You know it is.

571
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,361
All those widows.

572
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,740
I still hear them screaming.

573
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,578
Their husbands died because I'm here.

574
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,122
I'm going down to the ships.

575
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:33,999
No, you're not.

576
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:37,794
- I'm giving myself back to Menelaus.
- It's too late for that.

577
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:41,006
Do you think Agamemnon cares
about his brother's marriage?

578
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,592
This is about power. Not love.

579
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:46,011
Paris is going to fight in the morning.

580
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,223
- Yes.
- Menelaus will kill him.

581
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:51,683
I won't let that happen.

582
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,352
- It's his decision.
- No.

583
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:57,355
I can't ask anyone to fight for me.

584
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,984
I'm no longer queen of Sparta.

585
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,697
You're a princess of Troy now...

586
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,493
...and my brother needs you tonight.

587
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,896
My lord.

588
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:44,027
My lord, the army is marching.

589
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,073
- Let them. We stay.
- But the men are ready.

590
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,909
We stay till Agamemnon groans
to have Achilles back.

591
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,328
As you wish.

592
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,258
Are you ready to fight?

593
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:09,094
Are you ready to kill? To take life?

594
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,930
I am.

595
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:19,855
At night, I see their faces,
all the men I've killed.

596
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:24,359
They're standing there on the far bank
of the River Styx.

597
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,697
They're waiting for me.

598
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,868
They say, "Welcome, brother."

599
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,835
We men are wretched things.

600
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:49,801
I taught you how to fight,
but I never taught you why to fight.

601
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,136
I fight for you.

602
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,305
Who will you fight for when I'm gone?

603
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:59,394
Soldiers, they fight for kings
they've never even met.

604
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:03,106
They do what they're told,
die when they're told to.

605
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,649
Soldiers obey.

606
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:10,739
Don't waste your life following
some fool's orders.

607
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,243
Go.

608
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:42,163
Are you sure you want to do this?

609
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,000
I started this war.

610
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:02,559
Helen...

611
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,270
...sit with me.

612
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,950
Prepare to halt!

613
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,869
Prepare to halt!

614
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,787
Halt!

615
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,808
Move.

616
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:22,342
I see you're not hiding behind
your high walls. Valiant of you.

617
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:25,261
Ill-advised, but valiant.

618
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:29,182
You come here uninvited.
Go back to your ships and go home.

619
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,351
We've come too far, Prince Hector.

620
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:33,978
Prince? What prince?

621
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:36,981
What son of a king would accept
a man's hospitality...

622
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:41,486
...eat his food, drink his wine, then steal
his wife in the middle of the night?

623
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:44,948
The sun was shining
when your wife left you.

624
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,660
She's up there, watching,
isn't she? Good.

625
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:51,079
I want her to watch you die.

626
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,414
Not yet, brother.

627
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,293
Look around you, Hector.

628
01:10:57,461 --> 01:11:00,964
I brought all the warriors of Greece
to your shores.

629
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:03,216
You can still save Troy, young prince.

630
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:04,842
I have two wishes.

631
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:08,346
If you grant them,
no more of your people need die.

632
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:11,557
First, you must give Helen
back to my brother.

633
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:15,311
Second, Troy must submit
to my command...

634
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:18,189
...to fight for me whenever I call.

635
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:21,401
You want me to look upon your army
and tremble?

636
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,196
Well, I see them.

637
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:30,368
I see 50,000 men brought here
to fight for one man's greed.

638
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:35,707
Careful, boy.

639
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,710
My mercy has limits.

640
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:41,337
And I've seen the limits of your mercy.

641
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:45,925
And I tell you now, no son of Troy
will ever submit to a foreign ruler.

642
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,470
Then every son of Troy shall die.

643
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,476
There is another way.

644
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:01,899
I love Helen. I won't give her up
and neither will you.

645
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:03,651
So let us fight our own battle.

646
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:07,613
The winner takes Helen home.
And let that be the end of it.

647
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:11,367
A brave offer, but not enough.

648
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,620
Let me kill this little peacock.

649
01:12:14,788 --> 01:12:19,542
I didn't come here for your pretty wife.
I came here for Troy.

650
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,961
I came for my honor.

651
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:24,589
His every breath insults me.

652
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:28,593
Let me kill him. When he's lying
in the dust, signal to attack.

653
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:31,929
You'll have your city.
I'll have my revenge.

654
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:38,936
So be it.

655
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:47,570
I accept your challenge.
And tonight, I'll drink to your bones.

656
01:12:57,164 --> 01:13:00,416
- My lord.
- Back to the line!

657
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:17,350
Make him swing and miss. He'll tire.

658
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,395
Brother...

659
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:24,816
- ...if I fall, tell Helen... Tell her...
- I will.

660
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:27,777
Don't let Menelaus hurt her. If he...

661
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:31,364
You think of your sword and his sword
and nothing else.

662
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,770
Get up.

663
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:45,980
Come on.

664
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:33,528
See the crows?

665
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,573
They never tasted prince before.

666
01:16:12,025 --> 01:16:16,487
Is this what you left me for?!

667
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:18,322
Fight!

668
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:19,991
Fight me!

669
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:22,243
You coward!

670
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:23,744
Fight me!

671
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,289
We have a pact! Fight!

672
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:29,792
Fight him, son. Fight him.

673
01:16:30,043 --> 01:16:32,878
- Fight me!
- The Trojans have violated the agreement!

674
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:36,465
- Fight!
- Prepare for battle!

675
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:39,510
This is not honor!

676
01:16:39,886 --> 01:16:42,221
This is not worthy of royalty!

677
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:45,725
If he doesn't fight, Troy is doomed.

678
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:47,935
The fight is over.

679
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:52,023
The fight is not over.
Stand back, Prince Hector.

680
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,817
I'll kill him at your feet. I don't care.

681
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:56,319
He is my brother.

682
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,660
Paris!

683
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:56,420
Go!

684
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:05,221
Get inside, Paris!

685
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:06,972
Archers!

686
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:13,938
- Our men are too close to the walls.
- Pull back, you fool!

687
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:15,439
For Troy!

688
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:38,337
- Now!
- Loose!

689
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:08,284
Get them in line!

690
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:13,330
Get the men back into lines!

691
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,833
Front line, push!

692
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:06,759
Ah!

693
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:03,524
Forward.

694
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,652
Forward!

695
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:32,386
Apollonians! Now!

696
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:44,315
Prince Hector!

697
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:49,612
We need to retreat!

698
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,907
My army's never lost a battle yet!

699
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:55,451
You won't have an army
if you don't fall back!

700
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,667
Back to the ships!

701
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,669
- Back to the ships!
- Retreat!

702
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:07,379
- Back!
- Retreat!

703
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:08,714
Go back!

704
01:22:14,554 --> 01:22:15,888
Back. Back to the ships!

705
01:23:00,183 --> 01:23:01,767
Fall back!

706
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:04,478
- Men, fall back!
- Halt!

707
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:13,320
Halt!

708
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:14,905
But we have them on the run!

709
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:17,408
We're in range of their archers.

710
01:23:17,575 --> 01:23:19,410
Have our men gather our fallen.

711
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:22,579
Send an emissary to them.
They can collect their dead.

712
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:25,249
Would they have done the same for us?

713
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:29,837
Go! Back!

714
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,381
Fall back into line!

715
01:24:43,953 --> 01:24:45,621
You think I'm a coward.

716
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:49,583
I am a coward.

717
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:53,212
I knew he would kill me.

718
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:55,631
You were watching.

719
01:24:57,675 --> 01:24:59,176
My father.

720
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:05,849
My brother.
All of Troy. Shame didn't matter.

721
01:25:06,559 --> 01:25:08,435
I gave up my pride...

722
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:10,854
...my honor...

723
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:13,357
...just to live.

724
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:15,442
For love.

725
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:19,780
You challenged a great warrior.
That took courage.

726
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:23,742
I betrayed you.

727
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:32,709
Menelaus was a brave man.

728
01:25:36,005 --> 01:25:37,965
He lived for fighting.

729
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:46,056
And every day I was with him, I wanted
to walk into the sea and drown.

730
01:25:49,769 --> 01:25:53,564
I don't want a hero, my love.
I want a man I can grow old with.

731
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:01,905
They're laughing at me in Troy.
Drunk with victory!

732
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,200
They think I'll sail home at first light.

733
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:06,743
Maybe we should.

734
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:09,204
Flee? Like a whipped dog?

735
01:26:09,372 --> 01:26:13,000
The men believe we came here
for Menelaus' wife.

736
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:15,794
Won't be needing her anymore.

737
01:26:16,045 --> 01:26:19,131
My brother's blood still wets the sand,
and you insult him!

738
01:26:19,382 --> 01:26:21,967
It's no insult to say a dead man is dead.

739
01:26:22,218 --> 01:26:25,262
If we leave now, we lose all credibility.

740
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:29,975
The Trojans can beat us so easily.
How long before the Hittites invade?

741
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:34,563
If we stay, we stay here
for the right reasons.

742
01:26:34,772 --> 01:26:36,982
To protect Greece, not your pride.

743
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:39,818
Your private battle with Achilles
is destroying us.

744
01:26:39,986 --> 01:26:41,236
Achilles is one man.

745
01:26:41,487 --> 01:26:43,864
Hector is one man.

746
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:45,824
Look what he did to us today.

747
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:50,078
Hector fights for his country!
Achilles fights only for himself!

748
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:54,917
I don't care about the man's allegiance.
I care about his ability to win battles.

749
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:58,253
He's right.
The men's morale is weak.

750
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:03,383
Even if I could make peace with Achilles,
the man won't listen to me!

751
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:07,554
He's as likely to spear me
as to speak to me!

752
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:10,265
I'll talk to him.

753
01:27:10,433 --> 01:27:11,892
He'll want the girl back.

754
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:13,769
He can have that damn girl.

755
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:17,356
I haven't touched her.

756
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:18,982
Where is she?

757
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:20,901
I gave her to the men.

758
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:27,241
They need some amusement after today.

759
01:27:30,286 --> 01:27:32,579
Come on, give the bitch to me!

760
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:34,748
Who's first?

761
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,833
Trojan whore!

762
01:27:37,043 --> 01:27:39,044
What's this? A virgin's robe?

763
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:42,381
- You won't be needing that!
- Hold her.

764
01:27:48,012 --> 01:27:50,222
Better to be a Spartan slave
than a Trojan...

765
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:52,432
Achilles!

766
01:27:52,725 --> 01:27:54,893
Ah!

767
01:28:21,045 --> 01:28:22,879
Are you hurt?

768
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,471
I watched you fight them.
You have courage.

769
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:36,184
To fight back when people attack me?
Dog has that kind of courage.

770
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:01,168
Eat.

771
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:12,596
I've known men like you my whole life.

772
01:29:12,847 --> 01:29:14,014
No, you haven't.

773
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:17,100
You think you're so different
from 1000 others?

774
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:21,813
Soldiers understand nothing but war.
Peace confuses them.

775
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:24,316
- And you hate these soldiers.
- I pity them.

776
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,070
Trojan soldiers died trying to protect you.

777
01:29:28,237 --> 01:29:31,365
Perhaps they deserve
more than your pity.

778
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:35,786
Why did you choose this life?

779
01:29:35,953 --> 01:29:38,538
- What life?
- To be a great warrior.

780
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:44,753
I chose nothing.
I was born, and this is what I am.

781
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:49,383
And you? Why did you choose
to love a god?

782
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:53,303
I think you'll find the romance one-sided.

783
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:57,516
Do you enjoy provoking me?

784
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:01,561
You've dedicated your life to the gods.

785
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:05,357
Zeus, god of thunder. Athena,
goddess of wisdom. You serve them.

786
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:08,068
- Yes, of course.
- And Ares, god of war?

787
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:11,238
Who blankets his bed with the skin
of men he's killed?

788
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:15,784
All the gods are to be feared
and respected.

789
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:28,547
I'll tell you a secret...

790
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:31,800
...something they don't teach you
in your temple.

791
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:44,688
The gods envy us.

792
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:48,567
They envy us because we're mortal.

793
01:30:50,027 --> 01:30:52,946
Because any moment might be our last.

794
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:56,533
Everything's more beautiful
because we're doomed.

795
01:30:57,785 --> 01:31:00,704
You will never be lovelier
than you are now.

796
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:06,751
We will never be here again.

797
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:18,263
I thought you were a dumb brute.

798
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:23,852
I could have forgiven a dumb brute.

799
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,334
Do it.

800
01:31:53,883 --> 01:31:55,342
Nothing is easier.

801
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:56,843
Aren't you afraid?

802
01:31:59,096 --> 01:32:03,683
Everyone dies. Today or 50 years
from now. What does it matter?

803
01:32:08,481 --> 01:32:10,273
Do it.

804
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:14,027
You'll kill more men if I don't kill you.

805
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:15,779
Many.

806
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:31,104
My lord, there's...

807
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:49,748
Tell the men to start loading the ship.
we're going home.

808
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:55,462
Gather the stores.

809
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:02,886
Agamemnon is a proud man.

810
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:06,389
But he knows
when he's made a mistake.

811
01:34:06,557 --> 01:34:08,808
The man sends you
to make his apologies?

812
01:34:10,936 --> 01:34:13,647
What are you doing enthralled
to that pig of a king?

813
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:16,941
The world seems simple to you,
my friend...

814
01:34:17,109 --> 01:34:20,612
...but when you're a king,
very few choices are simple.

815
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:25,450
Ithaca cannot afford an enemy
like Agamemnon.

816
01:34:25,618 --> 01:34:27,285
Are we supposed to fear him?

817
01:34:27,453 --> 01:34:32,332
You don't fear anyone.
That's your problem. Fear is useful.

818
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:37,003
We need you back.

819
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:39,005
Greece needs you.

820
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:42,509
Greece got along fine before I was born.

821
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:44,928
Greece will be Greece
long after I'm dead.

822
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:49,641
I'm not talking about the land.
The men need you.

823
01:34:53,145 --> 01:34:54,688
Stay, Achilles.

824
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,273
You were born for this war.

825
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:02,987
Things are less simple today.

826
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:09,244
Women have a way
of complicating things.

827
01:35:12,998 --> 01:35:16,251
Of all the kings of Greece,
I respect you the most.

828
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:18,503
But in this war, you're a servant.

829
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:21,798
Sometimes you have to serve
in order to lead.

830
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:26,177
I hope you understand that one day.

831
01:35:31,308 --> 01:35:33,268
We're going home?

832
01:35:35,604 --> 01:35:36,855
We sail in the morning.

833
01:35:37,064 --> 01:35:40,525
Greeks are being slaughtered.
we can't just sail away.

834
01:35:40,693 --> 01:35:44,612
If it's fighting you still long for,
there will always be another war.

835
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:46,114
These are our countrymen.

836
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:49,284
You betray all of Greece
just to see Agamemnon fall.

837
01:35:49,702 --> 01:35:51,536
Someone has to lose.

838
01:35:56,959 --> 01:35:59,711
The gods favor our cause.

839
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:02,964
Now is the time to destroy
the Greek army.

840
01:36:04,383 --> 01:36:06,801
Their morale is battered.

841
01:36:06,969 --> 01:36:10,138
Hit them now. Hit them hard.

842
01:36:10,306 --> 01:36:12,140
And they will run.

843
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:20,356
The Myrmidons didn't fight yesterday.

844
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:22,317
There must be dissension
among the Greeks.

845
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:25,153
But if we attack their ships,
we will unify them.

846
01:36:25,863 --> 01:36:27,864
If they decide to attack us, let them.

847
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:30,992
Our walls can't be breached.
we'll beat them back again.

848
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:37,582
Yesterday, the Greeks
underestimated us.

849
01:36:38,542 --> 01:36:40,668
We should not return the favor.

850
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:57,018
You're confident about the meaning
of these omens?

851
01:36:57,186 --> 01:37:00,730
The desecration of his temple
angers Apollo.

852
01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:03,858
The gods have cursed the Greeks.

853
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,908
Prepare the army.
we attack at daybreak.

854
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:31,761
Am I still your captive?

855
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,224
You're my guest.

856
01:37:38,811 --> 01:37:41,938
In Troy, guests can leave
whenever they want.

857
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:43,773
You should leave then.

858
01:37:50,739 --> 01:37:52,740
Would you leave this all behind?

859
01:37:57,204 --> 01:37:58,872
Would you leave Troy?

860
01:40:55,591 --> 01:40:57,425
Hold those barricades!

861
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,239
Archers to the rear.

862
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:31,043
Achilles.

863
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:01,364
Now!

864
01:42:10,415 --> 01:42:11,749
Forward!

865
01:44:53,787 --> 01:44:55,371
Enough for one day.

866
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:59,375
Yes.

867
01:45:00,335 --> 01:45:01,836
Back to the ships!

868
01:45:02,004 --> 01:45:04,422
Back to the ships!

869
01:45:06,216 --> 01:45:07,967
It was his cousin.

870
01:45:12,347 --> 01:45:13,889
To Troy!

871
01:45:14,891 --> 01:45:17,768
- Back to the city!
- Back to the city!

872
01:45:17,936 --> 01:45:19,312
To Troy!

873
01:45:19,604 --> 01:45:21,230
Back to the city!

874
01:45:21,398 --> 01:45:23,566
We were going to sail home today.

875
01:45:26,403 --> 01:45:29,071
I don't think anyone's sailing home now.

876
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:49,383
Achilles.

877
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:05,524
You violated my command.

878
01:46:05,692 --> 01:46:08,027
No, my lord. There was a mistake.

879
01:46:08,195 --> 01:46:10,738
I ordered the Myrmidons to stand down.

880
01:46:10,906 --> 01:46:13,032
You led them into combat.

881
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:20,247
I didn't lead them, my lord.
We thought you did.

882
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:30,049
Where's Patroclus?

883
01:46:31,218 --> 01:46:32,927
Patroclus!

884
01:46:33,095 --> 01:46:35,346
We thought he was you, my lord.

885
01:46:37,057 --> 01:46:41,852
He wore your armor, your shield,
your greaves, your helmet.

886
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:43,813
He even moved like you.

887
01:46:44,272 --> 01:46:46,357
Where is he?

888
01:46:50,278 --> 01:46:52,196
- Where?
- He's dead, my lord.

889
01:46:55,826 --> 01:46:57,284
Hector cut his throat.

890
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:06,961
Don't! Don't!

891
01:47:36,741 --> 01:47:38,492
Where are you taking me?

892
01:47:44,332 --> 01:47:46,292
Do you remember how to get here?

893
01:47:46,835 --> 01:47:48,502
Yes.

894
01:47:56,011 --> 01:47:58,888
The next time you come here,
follow the tunnel.

895
01:47:59,055 --> 01:48:01,932
There are no turns, so you can't get lost.
Just keep walking.

896
01:48:02,434 --> 01:48:04,602
When you get to the end,
you'll be by the river.

897
01:48:04,811 --> 01:48:07,688
Follow the river until you get
to Mount Ida.

898
01:48:07,856 --> 01:48:09,523
Why are you telling me this?

899
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,364
- If I die...
- No.

900
01:48:17,532 --> 01:48:20,159
...I don't know how long
the city will stand.

901
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:23,037
If the Greeks get inside the walls,
it's over.

902
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:26,582
They'll kill all the men,
throw the babies from the city walls.

903
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:29,126
- Please.
- The women, they'll take as slaves.

904
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:33,172
- That, for you, will be worse than dying.
- Why are you saying such things?

905
01:48:34,799 --> 01:48:36,509
Because I want you to be ready.

906
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:41,472
I want you to get our boy,
and I want you to bring him here.

907
01:48:41,723 --> 01:48:46,227
You save as many people as you can,
but you get here. And you run.

908
01:48:52,984 --> 01:48:54,735
I killed a boy today.

909
01:48:56,655 --> 01:48:58,322
And he was young.

910
01:48:59,491 --> 01:49:01,325
He was much too young.

911
01:49:30,939 --> 01:49:33,607
That boy has just saved this war for us.

912
01:51:07,369 --> 01:51:09,536
- Eudorus.
- My lord.

913
01:51:09,704 --> 01:51:11,455
I need my armor.

914
01:52:12,392 --> 01:52:13,976
No.

915
01:52:15,353 --> 01:52:16,603
Don't go!

916
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:19,481
Rope!

917
01:52:19,649 --> 01:52:22,025
Hector's my cousin. He's a good man.

918
01:52:22,193 --> 01:52:25,362
Don't fight him. Please don't fight him.

919
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:27,698
Please.

920
01:52:33,788 --> 01:52:35,539
Ha!

921
01:53:22,378 --> 01:53:23,712
No.

922
01:53:49,864 --> 01:53:51,865
Hector!

923
01:53:58,081 --> 01:54:00,125
Hector!

924
01:54:19,936 --> 01:54:21,895
Father...

925
01:54:22,063 --> 01:54:24,439
...forgive me for any offenses.

926
01:54:26,192 --> 01:54:28,443
I've served you as best as I could.

927
01:54:29,112 --> 01:54:30,779
Hector!

928
01:54:35,076 --> 01:54:37,369
May the gods be with you.

929
01:54:41,833 --> 01:54:43,375
Hector.

930
01:54:45,795 --> 01:54:49,131
No father ever had a better son.

931
01:54:55,805 --> 01:54:57,389
Hector!

932
01:54:59,267 --> 01:55:00,851
Apollo guard you, my prince.

933
01:55:08,151 --> 01:55:09,526
You're the best man I know.

934
01:55:15,867 --> 01:55:17,743
You're a prince of Troy.

935
01:55:18,494 --> 01:55:19,953
I know you'll make me proud.

936
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:30,422
Hector!

937
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,524
Remember what I told you.

938
01:55:50,401 --> 01:55:53,403
You don't have to go. You don't.

939
01:55:53,655 --> 01:55:55,364
You remember what I told you.

940
01:56:13,883 --> 01:56:16,134
Hector!

941
01:56:31,818 --> 01:56:34,403
Hector!

942
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:51,563
I've seen this moment in my dreams.

943
01:57:53,649 --> 01:57:54,900
I'll make a pact with you.

944
01:57:55,943 --> 01:57:57,903
With the gods as our witnesses...

945
01:57:58,154 --> 01:58:02,824
...let us pledge that the winner will allow
the loser all the proper funeral rituals.

946
01:58:02,992 --> 01:58:05,994
There are no pacts
between lions and men.

947
01:58:14,003 --> 01:58:16,296
Now you know who you're fighting.

948
01:58:24,806 --> 01:58:27,641
I thought it was you
I was fighting yesterday.

949
01:58:27,975 --> 01:58:31,394
And I wish it had been you. But I gave
the dead boy the honor he deserved.

950
01:58:31,604 --> 01:58:34,147
You gave him the honor of your sword.

951
01:58:34,690 --> 01:58:38,026
You won't have eyes tonight.
You won't have ears or a tongue.

952
01:58:38,194 --> 01:58:42,364
You'll wander the underworld blind, deaf,
and dumb, and all the dead will know:

953
01:58:42,532 --> 01:58:46,243
This is Hector, the fool who thought
he killed Achilles.

954
02:00:44,403 --> 02:00:45,528
Get up, prince of Troy.

955
02:00:48,449 --> 02:00:51,201
Get up. I won't let a stone
take my glory.

956
02:04:26,375 --> 02:04:28,042
You lost your cousin.

957
02:04:30,045 --> 02:04:31,921
Now you've taken mine.

958
02:04:35,384 --> 02:04:36,968
When does it end?

959
02:04:39,054 --> 02:04:40,555
It never ends.

960
02:05:37,988 --> 02:05:39,572
Who are you?

961
02:05:39,740 --> 02:05:45,620
I have endured what no one
on earth has endured before.

962
02:05:46,288 --> 02:05:51,376
I kissed the hands of the man
who killed my son.

963
02:05:58,634 --> 02:06:00,301
Priam?

964
02:06:01,595 --> 02:06:02,804
How did you get in here?

965
02:06:03,055 --> 02:06:06,933
I know my own country better
than the Greeks, I think.

966
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:13,940
You're a brave man.

967
02:06:16,986 --> 02:06:20,154
I could have your head on a spit
in the blink of an eye.

968
02:06:20,531 --> 02:06:24,325
Do you really think death
frightens me now?

969
02:06:26,078 --> 02:06:28,663
I watched my eldest son die...

970
02:06:28,831 --> 02:06:32,667
...watched you drag his body
behind your chariot.

971
02:06:35,588 --> 02:06:37,755
Give him back to me.

972
02:06:38,841 --> 02:06:42,927
He deserves the honor of a proper burial.
You know that.

973
02:06:44,305 --> 02:06:46,514
Give him to me.

974
02:06:47,016 --> 02:06:48,683
He killed my cousin.

975
02:06:48,851 --> 02:06:50,852
He thought it was you.

976
02:06:53,439 --> 02:06:56,149
How many cousins have you killed?

977
02:06:57,693 --> 02:07:01,571
How many sons and fathers
and brothers and husbands?

978
02:07:01,864 --> 02:07:04,365
How many, brave Achilles?

979
02:07:06,327 --> 02:07:08,369
I knew your father.

980
02:07:09,538 --> 02:07:11,873
He died before his time.

981
02:07:13,125 --> 02:07:18,338
But he was lucky not to live long enough
to see his son fall.

982
02:07:23,218 --> 02:07:25,887
You have taken everything from me.

983
02:07:28,223 --> 02:07:29,891
My eldest son...

984
02:07:30,601 --> 02:07:32,226
...heir to my throne...

985
02:07:32,853 --> 02:07:34,812
...defender of my kingdom.

986
02:07:36,815 --> 02:07:41,486
I cannot change what happened.
It is the will of the gods.

987
02:07:42,738 --> 02:07:46,115
But give me this small mercy.

988
02:07:48,202 --> 02:07:52,038
I loved my boy from the moment
he opened his eyes...

989
02:07:52,206 --> 02:07:55,375
...till the moment you closed them.

990
02:07:57,753 --> 02:08:00,755
Let me wash his body.

991
02:08:02,383 --> 02:08:05,635
Let me say the prayers.

992
02:08:06,887 --> 02:08:11,766
Let me place two coins on his eyes
for the boatman.

993
02:08:16,563 --> 02:08:18,773
If I let you walk out of here...

994
02:08:21,110 --> 02:08:23,069
...if I let you take him...

995
02:08:25,698 --> 02:08:27,740
...it doesn't change anything.

996
02:08:29,284 --> 02:08:31,953
You're still my enemy in the morning.

997
02:08:33,122 --> 02:08:36,165
You're still my enemy tonight.

998
02:08:37,209 --> 02:08:40,795
But even enemies can show respect.

999
02:09:00,482 --> 02:09:01,816
I admire your courage.

1000
02:09:09,491 --> 02:09:11,284
Meet me outside in a moment.

1001
02:09:54,119 --> 02:09:55,870
We'll meet again soon, my brother.

1002
02:10:14,306 --> 02:10:16,724
Your son was the best I've fought.

1003
02:10:19,895 --> 02:10:22,563
In my country, the funeral games
last for 12 days.

1004
02:10:23,148 --> 02:10:25,066
It is the same in my country.

1005
02:10:25,234 --> 02:10:27,401
Then the prince will have that honor.

1006
02:10:27,653 --> 02:10:31,072
No Greek will attack Troy for 12 days.

1007
02:10:37,204 --> 02:10:38,579
Briseis?

1008
02:10:41,667 --> 02:10:44,043
We thought you were dead.

1009
02:10:54,721 --> 02:10:56,055
You are free.

1010
02:11:10,571 --> 02:11:12,280
If I hurt you...

1011
02:11:14,449 --> 02:11:16,659
...it's not what I wanted.

1012
02:11:31,341 --> 02:11:32,884
Go.

1013
02:11:33,051 --> 02:11:36,220
No one will stop you.
You have my word.

1014
02:11:36,972 --> 02:11:38,639
Come, my girl.

1015
02:11:46,982 --> 02:11:50,860
You're a far better king than the one
leading this army.

1016
02:12:07,502 --> 02:12:11,964
Achilles makes a secret pact, and I
have to honor it? What treason is this?

1017
02:12:12,132 --> 02:12:16,344
Consorting with the enemy king.
Giving him 12 days of peace.

1018
02:12:16,511 --> 02:12:18,638
Peace! Peace!

1019
02:12:19,097 --> 02:12:21,641
Their prince is dead.
Their army is leaderless.

1020
02:12:21,808 --> 02:12:23,643
This is the time to attack!

1021
02:12:23,810 --> 02:12:27,897
Even with Hector gone,
we have no way to breach their walls.

1022
02:12:28,106 --> 02:12:30,816
I will smash their walls to the ground...

1023
02:12:30,984 --> 02:12:35,696
...if it costs me 40,000 Greeks.
Hear me, Zeus!

1024
02:12:36,531 --> 02:12:40,952
I will smash their walls to the ground.

1025
02:12:53,966 --> 02:12:55,383
That's good.

1026
02:12:55,717 --> 02:12:57,677
For my son back home.

1027
02:13:23,245 --> 02:13:24,745
Well, Odysseus.

1028
02:13:25,747 --> 02:13:30,459
You found a way to make the sheep
invite the wolves to dinner.

1029
02:13:46,101 --> 02:13:49,770
Forgive me, Eudorus.
I should never have struck you.

1030
02:13:51,064 --> 02:13:54,108
You've been a loyal friend all your life.

1031
02:13:55,777 --> 02:13:58,446
I hope I never disappoint you again.

1032
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:01,282
It's I who have been the disappointment.

1033
02:14:02,951 --> 02:14:05,578
Rouse the men.
You're taking them home.

1034
02:14:06,121 --> 02:14:07,955
Aren't you coming with us?

1035
02:14:08,749 --> 02:14:10,958
I have my own battle to fight.

1036
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:13,127
Let me march beside you.

1037
02:14:13,295 --> 02:14:17,548
No. I don't want our men
to be a part of this.

1038
02:14:23,221 --> 02:14:25,056
It's a beautiful night.

1039
02:14:25,724 --> 02:14:28,976
Go, Eudorus.
This is the last order I give you.

1040
02:14:34,775 --> 02:14:37,902
Fighting for you has been
my life's honor, my lord.

1041
02:15:47,722 --> 02:15:48,973
Open the gates!

1042
02:16:03,488 --> 02:16:05,156
Here.

1043
02:16:31,516 --> 02:16:33,184
Plague.

1044
02:16:33,852 --> 02:16:36,437
Don't go too close, my king.

1045
02:16:37,022 --> 02:16:39,273
This is the will of the gods.

1046
02:16:39,441 --> 02:16:41,483
They desecrated the temple of Apollo...

1047
02:16:41,693 --> 02:16:44,445
...and Apollo desecrated their flesh.

1048
02:16:44,654 --> 02:16:48,616
They thought they could come here
and sack our city in a day.

1049
02:16:48,783 --> 02:16:52,620
Now look at them,
fleeing across the Aegean.

1050
02:16:56,166 --> 02:16:57,958
What is this?

1051
02:16:58,126 --> 02:17:00,294
An offering to Poseidon.

1052
02:17:00,462 --> 02:17:02,963
The Greeks are praying
for a safe return home.

1053
02:17:03,298 --> 02:17:08,177
This is a gift. We should take it
to the temple of Poseidon.

1054
02:17:08,762 --> 02:17:10,721
- I think we should burn it.
- Burn it?

1055
02:17:10,972 --> 02:17:13,098
My prince, it's a gift to the gods.

1056
02:17:16,603 --> 02:17:19,104
Father, burn it.

1057
02:18:16,663 --> 02:18:18,205
Look at them.

1058
02:18:19,708 --> 02:18:22,167
You'd think their prince had never died.

1059
02:18:24,337 --> 02:18:26,380
You are the prince now.

1060
02:18:27,173 --> 02:18:29,216
Make your brother proud.

1061
02:22:06,768 --> 02:22:08,519
Briseis. Where is she?

1062
02:22:08,728 --> 02:22:10,938
- Where?
- I don't know.

1063
02:22:11,105 --> 02:22:12,940
Please. I have a son.

1064
02:22:13,274 --> 02:22:15,776
Then get him out of Troy.

1065
02:22:30,583 --> 02:22:31,917
Briseis!

1066
02:23:16,462 --> 02:23:19,548
Paris! Andromache!

1067
02:23:20,967 --> 02:23:22,801
Helen. We must go.

1068
02:23:22,969 --> 02:23:24,803
- Where?
- I'll show you.

1069
02:23:24,971 --> 02:23:26,763
Paris.

1070
02:23:26,931 --> 02:23:29,474
It's a long way. Quick.
We must go now.

1071
02:23:29,767 --> 02:23:31,268
Briseis!

1072
02:23:34,439 --> 02:23:36,189
Paris!

1073
02:23:49,370 --> 02:23:53,665
Let it burn! Let Troy burn!

1074
02:23:53,833 --> 02:23:57,169
Burn it! Burn it all!

1075
02:23:57,837 --> 02:24:02,591
Burn Troy!

1076
02:24:03,176 --> 02:24:05,385
It's a long way. Quick.

1077
02:24:09,223 --> 02:24:10,849
- Come.
- I stay.

1078
02:24:11,017 --> 02:24:13,226
- No.
- My father will never abandon the city.

1079
02:24:13,394 --> 02:24:14,811
I can't leave him.

1080
02:24:14,979 --> 02:24:18,482
The city is dead.
They're burning it to the ground.

1081
02:24:20,026 --> 02:24:22,194
- What's your name?
- Aeneas.

1082
02:24:22,362 --> 02:24:25,364
- Do you know how to use a sword?
- Yes.

1083
02:24:25,573 --> 02:24:27,574
The sword of Troy.

1084
02:24:27,742 --> 02:24:31,244
As long as it's in the hands of a Trojan,
our people have a future.

1085
02:24:31,412 --> 02:24:34,039
Protect them, Aeneas.
Find them a new home.

1086
02:24:34,248 --> 02:24:35,916
- I will.
- Hurry.

1087
02:24:36,834 --> 02:24:39,252
Paris, Briseis wasn't in her room.

1088
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:40,921
I'll find her.

1089
02:24:43,341 --> 02:24:45,008
Go.

1090
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:47,427
- I'll stay with you.
- Go.

1091
02:24:47,637 --> 02:24:49,012
Please don't leave me.

1092
02:24:49,180 --> 02:24:51,181
- How could you love me if I ran now?
- Please.

1093
02:24:51,349 --> 02:24:55,644
We will be together again, in this world
or the next. We will be together.

1094
02:25:02,443 --> 02:25:04,069
Go.

1095
02:25:07,657 --> 02:25:09,783
To the gate!

1096
02:25:21,087 --> 02:25:23,088
Soldiers of Troy...

1097
02:25:23,381 --> 02:25:25,632
...you men are warriors!

1098
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:28,468
To lead you has been my honor!

1099
02:25:28,678 --> 02:25:31,471
- Yeah!
- My prince!

1100
02:25:32,974 --> 02:25:34,975
The boatman waits for us.

1101
02:25:35,184 --> 02:25:38,645
I say we make him wait a little longer!

1102
02:26:00,334 --> 02:26:01,793
Paris!

1103
02:26:02,295 --> 02:26:04,254
Paris!

1104
02:26:40,792 --> 02:26:42,709
Have you no honor?

1105
02:26:43,669 --> 02:26:45,378
Have you no honor?

1106
02:27:17,078 --> 02:27:19,663
Too late for prayer, priestess.

1107
02:27:27,672 --> 02:27:31,258
I almost lost this war
because of your little romance.

1108
02:27:43,104 --> 02:27:47,107
You'll be my slave in Mycenae.

1109
02:27:47,316 --> 02:27:51,611
A Troyan priestess scrubbing my floors.

1110
02:27:53,698 --> 02:27:55,031
And at night...

1111
02:28:08,629 --> 02:28:10,297
Get up!

1112
02:28:13,593 --> 02:28:15,427
Hold her.

1113
02:28:23,603 --> 02:28:24,936
Come with me.

1114
02:28:28,649 --> 02:28:30,150
No!

1115
02:28:35,489 --> 02:28:38,658
Paris!

1116
02:28:41,996 --> 02:28:43,163
No!

1117
02:28:53,883 --> 02:28:56,885
Stop! Please!

1118
02:29:02,433 --> 02:29:04,684
Paris! Don't!

1119
02:29:30,711 --> 02:29:34,631
It's all right.

1120
02:29:49,981 --> 02:29:51,940
You gave me peace...

1121
02:29:53,734 --> 02:29:55,819
...in a lifetime of war.

1122
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:02,742
Briseis, come.

1123
02:30:02,994 --> 02:30:04,452
Go.

1124
02:30:05,538 --> 02:30:06,746
You must.

1125
02:30:07,331 --> 02:30:08,748
No.

1126
02:30:09,166 --> 02:30:10,834
Troy is falling.

1127
02:30:11,419 --> 02:30:13,253
Go.

1128
02:30:16,716 --> 02:30:19,968
We must go. I know a way out.

1129
02:30:24,223 --> 02:30:25,557
It's all right.

1130
02:30:28,060 --> 02:30:29,769
Go.

1131
02:30:34,859 --> 02:30:37,277
Briseis, come.

1132
02:30:37,445 --> 02:30:39,279
Go.

1133
02:32:08,953 --> 02:32:10,578
Find peace...

1134
02:32:11,539 --> 02:32:13,039
...my brother.

1135
02:32:25,886 --> 02:32:30,390
If they ever tell my story,
let them say...

1136
02:32:30,641 --> 02:32:33,143
...I walked with giants.

1137
02:32:33,811 --> 02:32:37,230
Men rise and fall like the winter wheat...

1138
02:32:37,481 --> 02:32:40,024
...but these names will never die.

1139
02:32:41,986 --> 02:32:45,572
Let them say I lived
in the time of Hector...

1140
02:32:45,739 --> 02:32:47,907
...tamer of horses.

1141
02:32:48,325 --> 02:32:50,243
Let them say...

1142
02:32:50,411 --> 02:32:54,080
...I lived in the time of Achilles.
