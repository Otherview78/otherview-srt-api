1
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:17,012
Dougal, settle down now, please.

2
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,723
It won't be long.

3
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,076
Customs official: Next.

4
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,959
- British, huh?
- Yes.

5
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,212
- First trip to New York?
- Yes.

6
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,547
Anything edible in there?

7
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:56,927
Livestock?

8
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,935
Must get that fixed. Um... no.

9
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,354
Let me take a look.

10
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,295
Welcome to New York.

11
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,505
Thank you.

12
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,881
Next.

13
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,971
Witness: And it was like a... like a wind.

14
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,807
Or like a... like a ghost.

15
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,016
But dark.

16
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,061
And I saw its eyes.

17
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,189
Shining white eyes.

18
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,154
A dark wind, with eyes?

19
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,989
It's like a dark mass.

20
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,493
And it dove down there. Down underground.

21
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,329
Someone ought to do something about it.

22
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,791
It's everywhere, this thing.
It's out of control.

23
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,837
Hey, you get anything?

24
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,506
Reporter: Dark wind. Blah, blah.

25
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,342
Photographer: Some sorta
atmospheric hooey. Or electrical.

26
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,220
Reporter: Hey, you thirsty?

27
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,141
No. I'm on the wagon.
Promised Martha I'd lay off.

28
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,521
Photographer: It's atmospheric.

29
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,477
Out of the way, folks. Coming through!

30
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:15,398
Mary Lou: This great city sparkles
with the jewels of man's inventions.

31
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,901
Movie theaters, automobiles,

32
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,654
the wireless, electric lights,

33
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,740
- all dazzle and bewitch us.
- I'm so sorry.

34
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,577
But where there is light,
there is shadow, friend.

35
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,497
Something is stalking our city,

36
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,209
wreaking destruction, and then
disappearing without a trace!

37
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,088
We have to fight.

38
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,509
Join us, the second salemers,
in our fight.

39
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,512
Excuse me, do”.
Just trying to get to the bank.

40
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,823
Mary Lou: We have to fight together

41
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,115
- for the sake of our...
- Excuse me...

42
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,266
Man: Hey! Watch it!

43
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,434
So sorry. My case.

44
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,020
No harm done.

45
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,147
Excuse me.

46
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,524
You!

47
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,067
Fhend.

48
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,406
What drew you to our meeting today?

49
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,867
Oh, lwasjust passing.

50
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,368
Are you a seeker?

51
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,620
A seeker after truth?

52
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,416
Newt: I'm more of a chaser, really.

53
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,003
Mary Lou: Hear my words.

54
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,588
And heed my warning.

55
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,425
And laugh if you dare.

56
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,846
Witches live among us.

57
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,474
We have to fight together
for the sake of our children.

58
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,435
For the sake of tomorrow.

59
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,007
What do you say to that, friend?

60
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,157
Excuse me.

61
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,304
Can I help you, sir?

62
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,184
No, I was just... I was just waiting.

63
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,366
What brings you here?

64
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,534
Same as you.

65
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,627
You're here to get a loan
to open up a bakery?

66
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,872
Yes.

67
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,833
What are the odds of that?

68
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,547
- Well, may the best man win, I guess.
- Excuse me.

69
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,551
Hey! Hey, mister!

70
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,095
Hey, mister.

71
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,639
Hey, fella.

72
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,558
Mr. Kowalski,
Mr. Bingley will see you now.

73
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,061
Okay.

74
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,730
Okay.

75
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,151
Mr. Bingley: You're currently working

76
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,676
in a canning factory.

77
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,430
That's the best I can do.
I only got back in, uh, '24.

78
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,808
- Got back?
- From Europe, sir.

79
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:40,020
Yeah. I was part
of the expeditionary forces there.

80
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,982
- All right.
- Mr. Bingley: Mr. Kowalski...

81
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,098
You gotta try the paczkis, okay?

82
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,727
It's my grandmother's recipe.
The orange zestjust...

83
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,694
Mr. Bingley: Mr. Kowalski,

84
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,483
what do you propose
to offer the bank as collateral?

85
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,443
Collateral?

86
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,111
Collateral.

87
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,448
There are machines now

88
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:37,285
that can produce hundreds
of donuts an hour.

89
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,805
I know. I know. But they're nothing
like what I can do. You...

90
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,165
The bank must be protected, Mr. Kowalski,

91
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,834
good day to you.

92
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,024
Hey! Mr. English guy!

93
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,818
I think your egg is hatching.

94
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,666
What just happened?

95
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,723
But, excuse me?

96
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,898
I was over there. Came over...

97
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,692
I was over there.

98
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,239
- In you hop.
- Jacob: Hello?

99
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,842
Newt: No.

100
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,117
Everyone settle down.

101
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,215
Stay. Dougal, don't make me come in there.

102
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,373
Don't make me come down there.

103
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,211
Absolutely not.

104
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,297
Alohomora.

105
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,052
Oh, so you're gonna steal the money, huh?

106
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,032
Petrificus totalus.

107
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,934
Mr. Bingley!

108
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,397
Kowalski.

109
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,612
Really?

110
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,337
No. Don't play that.

111
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,756
Look.

112
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:00,595
Oh, no.

113
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,139
No, no, no. Don't... don't shoot.

114
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,974
Don't shoot!

115
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,602
Newt: Right. For the last time,
you pilfering pest,

116
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,647
paws off what doesn't belong to you.

117
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,093
Man: Someone's robbing the bank!

118
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,816
Awfully sorry about that.

119
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,153
What the hell was that?

120
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,177
Newt: Nothing that need concern you.

121
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,909
Now, unfortunately,
you have seen far too much.

122
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,876
If you wouldn't mind,
if you just stand there,

123
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,496
this'll be over in a jiffy.

124
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,747
Mmm-hmm. Sure. Yeah.

125
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,918
Sorry.

126
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,006
Buggen

127
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,149
Who are you?

128
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,986
- I'm sorry.
- Who are you?

129
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,364
- Newt scamander. And you are?
- What's that thing in your case?

130
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,533
That's my niffler.

131
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,369
Say, you've got something on your...

132
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,346
Why in the name of deliverance Dane
did you let that thing loose?

133
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,100
I didn't mean to.
He's incorrigible, you see.

134
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,324
- Anything shiny, he's all over...
- You didn't mean to?

135
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,687
- No.
- You could not have chosen

136
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,171
a worse time to let that creature loose.

137
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,340
We're in the middle of a situation here.

138
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:22,677
I'm taking you in.

139
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,387
Taking me in where?

140
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,310
Magical congress of
the United States ofamerica.

141
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,228
So you work for macusa.

142
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,288
What are you, some kind of investigator?

143
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,786
At least tell me
you took care of the no-maj.

144
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,155
- The what?
- The no-maj.

145
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,783
No-magic. The non-wizard!

146
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,262
Oh. Sorry, we call them Muggles.

147
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,829
You wiped his memory, right?

148
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,998
The no-maj with the case?

149
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,209
- Um...
- Oh...

150
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,463
That's a section 3-a, Mr. Scamander.

151
00:13:58,755 --> 00:13:59,839
I'm taking you in.

152
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:09,766
Tina: Come on.

153
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,354
Sorry, but I do have
things to do, actually.

154
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,315
Well...
You'll have to rearrange them.

155
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,151
What are you doin' in New York anyway?

156
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,736
I came to buy a birthday present.

157
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,090
Couldn't you have done that in London?

158
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,051
Newt: No, there's only one breeder
of appaloosa puffskeins in the world,

159
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,202
and he lives in New York. So, no.

160
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,121
I got a section 3-a.

161
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,208
Hey.

162
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,087
By the way, we don't allow the breeding
of magical creatures in New York.

163
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,589
We closed that guy down a year ago.

164
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,806
Hey, Goldstein.

165
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,683
Hey, red.

166
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,896
Major investigation department.

167
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,263
- I thought you was...
- Major investigation department.

168
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,733
I got a section 3-a.

169
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,703
The international confederation
is threatening to send a delegation.

170
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,582
They think this is related to
Grindelwald's attacks in Europe.

171
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,459
I was there.

172
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:01,878
This is a beast.

173
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,340
No human could do what this thing
is capable of, madam president.

174
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,052
Whatever it is, one thing is clear.
It must be stopped.

175
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,721
It's terrorizing no-majs.

176
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,849
And when no-majs are afraid, they attack.

177
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,185
This could mean exposure.

178
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,478
It could mean war.

179
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,363
I made your position here
quite clear, Ms. Goldstein.

180
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,700
- Yes, madam president. But I...
- You're no longer an auror.

181
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,581
No, madam president, but...

182
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:39,874
Goldstein.

183
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,125
There's been a minor...

184
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:45,630
This office is currently concerned
with very major incidents. Get out.

185
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,839
Yes, ma'am.

186
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,825
So you got your wand permit?

187
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,119
All foreigners have to
have them in New York.

188
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,956
I made a postal application weeks ago.

189
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,920
Tina: Scamander...

190
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,548
And you were just in Equatorial Guinea?

191
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,526
And I've just completed
a year in the fields.

192
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,635
I'm writing a book
about magical creatures.

193
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,762
Like an extermination guide?

194
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,223
No, a guide to help people understand

195
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,743
why we should be protecting
these creatures instead of killing them.

196
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,893
Mr. Abernathy: Goldstein?

197
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,478
Where is she?

198
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,022
Where is she? Goldstein?

199
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,441
Goldstein?

200
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,696
Did you just butt in
on the investigative team again?

201
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,827
Where have you been?

202
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,203
What?

203
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,622
Where'd she pick you up?

204
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,670
Have you been tracking
them second salemers again?

205
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,422
Of course not, sir.

206
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,051
Afternoon, Mr. Graves, sir.

207
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,137
Afternoon, Abernathy.

208
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,181
Mr. Graves, sir, this is Mr. Scamander.

209
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,933
He has a crazy creature in that case,

210
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,644
and it got out
and caused mayhem in a bank.

211
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,522
Let's see the little guy.

212
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,551
Tina.

213
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,865
I'm sorry, grandma.

214
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,567
What the...

215
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,956
My momma, your momma

216
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,541
gonna catch a witch

217
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,628
my momma, your momma
flying on a switch

218
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,466
my momma, your momma
witches never cry

219
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:21,470
my momma, your momma
witches gonna die

220
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:25,599
witch number one, drown in the river

221
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,353
witch number two, got a noose to give her

222
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:48,289
Witch number three,
gonna watch her burn

223
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:52,501
witch number four, flogging take a turn

224
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,010
Collect your leaflets
before you get food, children.

225
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,819
Is it a witch's Mark, ma'am?

226
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,494
He's okay.

227
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,382
I can't believe
you didn't obliviate that man.

228
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,344
If there's an inquiry, I'm finished.

229
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,030
Why would you be finished?
I'm the one that's...

230
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,473
I'm not supposed
to go near the second salemers.

231
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,356
What was that?

232
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,943
Uh, moth, I think. Big moth.

233
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,550
Policeman: Hey! Quiet down!
I'm trying to get a statement.

234
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,827
Housewife: I'm telling you,
it's a gas explosion again.

235
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,412
I ain't taking
the kids back up there until it's safe.

236
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,419
Hey, sorry, ma'am.
There ain't no smell of gas.

237
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,250
It weren't gas, officer. I seen it.

238
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,461
It was a gigantic, huge hippopoto...

239
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,255
Gas.

240
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,715
Gas. It was gas!

241
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,410
Tina: Mr. Scamander!

242
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:12,433
It was open?

243
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,685
Just a smidge.

244
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,652
That crazy niffler thing's
on the loose again?

245
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,754
Uh... might be.

246
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,317
Then look for it.

247
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,235
Look! Oh...

248
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,987
His neck's bleeding.

249
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,530
He's hurt.

250
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,241
Oh... wake up! Mr. No-maj.

251
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,579
Mercy Lewis, what is that?

252
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,190
Newt: It's nothing to worry about.

253
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,335
That is a murtlap.

254
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,450
What else have you got in there?

255
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,550
- You?
- Hello.

256
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,552
Easy, Mr...

257
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,179
Kowalski. Jacob.

258
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,348
You can't obliviate him.

259
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,515
We need him as a witness.

260
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,744
I'm sorry. You've just yelled at me
the length of New York

261
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,037
for not doing it in the first place.

262
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,021
- He's hurt! He looks ill.
- He'll be fine.

263
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,148
Murtlap bites aren't serious.

264
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,822
Yeah, I admit that is a slightly more
severe reaction than I've seen.

265
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,045
But if it was really serious, he'd have...

266
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:14,370
What?

267
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,682
Well, the first symptom
would be flames out of his anus.

268
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,142
- He doesn't seem to...
- This is balled up!

269
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,446
It'll last 48 hours at the most.

270
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,033
- I can keep him, if you want me to.
- Keep him?

271
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,463
We don't keep them.

272
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,301
Mr. Scamander, do you know anything
about the wizarding community in america?

273
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,029
I do know a few things, actually.

274
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,515
I know that you have rather backwards laws
about relations with non-magic people.

275
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,952
That you're not meant to befriend them.

276
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,787
That you can't marry them,
which seems mildly absurd to me.

277
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,229
Who's gonna marry him?

278
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,606
You're both coming with me.

279
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,400
I don't see why I need to come with you.

280
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,360
- Help me.
- I'm dreaming, right?

281
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:47,569
- Yeah.
- Please.

282
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,114
Jacob: I'm tired.
I never went to the bank.

283
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,200
This is all just
some big nightmare, right?

284
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,119
For the both of us, Mr. Kowalski.

285
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,443
Man 1: Hey, you all right there?

286
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,113
Man 2: Whoa!

287
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,429
And so this is the newsroom.

288
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,680
Let's go.

289
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,974
Hey, how are you?

290
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,810
Make way for the barebones.

291
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,647
Now, they're just
putting the papers to bed,

292
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,357
as they say.

293
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,239
Mr. Shaw. Sir. He's with the senator.

294
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,825
Never mind that, barker.
I wanna see my father.

295
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,378
I'm so sorry, Mr. Shaw,
but your son insisted.

296
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,018
Father, you're gonna wanna hear this.

297
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,504
I've got something huge.

298
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,956
Shaw senior: Your brother and I
are busy here, Langdon.

299
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,368
Working on his election campaign.

300
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,093
We don't have time for this.

301
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:38,097
Langdon: This is Mary Lou barebone
from the new Salem preservation society.

302
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,015
And she's got a big story for you.

303
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,018
Oh, she has, has she?

304
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,687
Langdon: There's strange things
going on all over the city.

305
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,482
The people behind this,
they are not like you and me.

306
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,609
This is witchcraft. Don't you see?

307
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,856
- Shaw senior: Langdon.
- She doesn't want any money.

308
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,698
Then either her story is worthless,
or she's lying about the cost.

309
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,985
Nobody gives away anything
valuable for free, Langdon.

310
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,438
Mary Lou: You're right, Mr. Shaw.

311
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,831
What we desire is infinitely
more valuable than money.

312
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,541
It's your influence.

313
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,293
Millions of people read your newspapers,

314
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,462
and they need to be made aware
about this danger.

315
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,382
The crazy disturbances in the subway.

316
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,050
Just look at the pictures.

317
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,257
Shaw senior: I'd like
you and your friends to leave.

318
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:20,405
No. Look, you're missing a trick here.
Just look at the evidence!

319
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,723
Shaw senior: Really?

320
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,226
Senator Shaw: Langdon.
Listen to father and just go.

321
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:25,978
And...

322
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,605
Take the freaks with you.

323
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,566
Langdon: This is father's office,
not yours.

324
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,085
And I'm sick of this.
Every time I walk in here...

325
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,318
Shaw senior: Okay. That's it!

326
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,821
Thank you.

327
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,243
We hope you'll reconsider, Mr. Shaw.

328
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,538
We 're not difficult to find.

329
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,124
Until then,

330
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,917
we thank you for your time.

331
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,014
Hey, boy!

332
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,434
You dropped something.

333
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,023
Here you go, freak.

334
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,775
Why don't you put that in the trash
where you all belong?

335
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,287
Take a right here.

336
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,215
Okay.

337
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,549
Before we go in...

338
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,010
I'm not supposed to have men
on the premises.

339
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,906
In that case, Mr. Kowalski and I
can easily seek other accommodations.

340
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,210
No, you don't.

341
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,217
Watch your step.

342
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:53,941
Mrs. Esposito: Thatyou, Tina?

343
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,108
Shh.

344
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,694
Yes, Mrs. Esposito.

345
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,021
Mrs. Esposito: Are you alone?

346
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,949
I'm always alone, Mrs. Esposito.

347
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:16,755
Queenie: Teen/e,

348
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,548
you brought men home.

349
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,928
Gentlemen, this is my sister.

350
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,182
Wanna put something on, queenie?

351
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:28,850
Oh, sure.

352
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,369
So, who are they?

353
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,745
That's Mr. Scamander.

354
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,249
He's committed a serious infraction
of the national statute of secrecy.

355
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,626
- He's a criminal?
- Uh-huh.

356
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,712
And that's Mr. Kowalski. He's a no-maj.

357
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:58,714
Queenie: A no-maj?

358
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,049
Teen, what are you up to?

359
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,593
He's sick. It's a long story.

360
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,390
Mr. Scamander has lost something
I'm going to help him find.

361
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,101
You need to sit down, honey.

362
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,145
He hasn't eaten anything all day.

363
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,396
And...

364
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,148
Oh, that's rough.

365
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,818
He didn't get the money
he wanted for his bakery.

366
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,068
You bake, honey?

367
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,739
I love to cook.

368
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,625
- You're a legilimens?
- Queenie: Mmm. Yeah.

369
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,618
But I always have trouble
with your kind. Brits.

370
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,329
It's the accent.

371
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,998
You know how to read minds?

372
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,916
Oh, don't worry, honey.

373
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,086
Most guys think what you was thinking
first time they see me.

374
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,924
Now, you need food.

375
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,523
Queenie: Hot dog? Again?
Tina: Don't read my mind.

376
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,130
Queenie: Not a very wholesome lunch.

377
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,539
Hey, Mr. Scamander.

378
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,712
You prefer pie or strudel?

379
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,801
I really don't have a preference.

380
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,599
You prefer strudel, huh, honey?

381
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,228
Strudel it is.

382
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,707
Well, sit down, Mr. Scamander.

383
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,671
We're not gonna poison you.

384
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:39,916
Graves: You're upset.

385
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,044
It's your mother again.

386
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,714
Somebody said something.

387
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,716
What did they say? Tell me.

388
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:49,593
Do you think I'm a freak?

389
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,721
No. I think you're
a very special young man,

390
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:56,016
or I wouldn't have
asked you to help me, now would I?

391
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,980
Have you any news?

392
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,441
I'm still looking.

393
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:05,609
Mmm.

394
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,947
Mr. Graves, if I knew
whether it was a girl or a boy...

395
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,493
My vision showed
only the child's immense power.

396
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,496
He or she is no older than 10.

397
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,708
I saw this child
in close proximity to your mother.

398
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,211
She I saw so plainly.

399
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,276
That could be any one of hundreds...

400
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:29,090
There's something else.
Something I haven't told you.

401
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,593
I saw you beside me in New York.

402
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,139
You're the one who gains
this child's trust.

403
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:39,100
You are the key. I saw this.

404
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,270
You want to join the wizarding world.

405
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,190
I want those things too, credence.

406
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,775
I want them for you.

407
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,903
So find the child.

408
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,781
Find the child and we'll all be free.

409
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,035
Queenie: The job ain't that glamorous.

410
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,287
I mean, I spend most days making coffee.

411
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,997
Unjinxing the John.

412
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,749
Tina's the career girl.

413
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,628
Nah, we 're orphans.

414
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,131
Ma and pa died of dragon pox
when we were kids.

415
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,135
You're sweet.

416
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,555
But we got each other.

417
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,976
Could you stop
reading my mind for a second?

418
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,980
Don't get me wrong, I love it.

419
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,276
This meal, it's insanely good.

420
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,361
And this is what I do, I'm a cook.

421
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:35,657
And this is like the greatest meal
I have ever had in my life.

422
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,870
Oh! You slay me.

423
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,999
I ain't never
really talked to a no-maj before.

424
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,500
Huh.

425
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,960
Really?

426
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,510
I am not flirting.

427
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,309
I'm just saying,
don't go getting attached.

428
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,394
He's gonna have to be obliviated.

429
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,063
It's nothing personal.

430
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,774
Oh, hey, you okay, honey?

431
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,570
So, Ms. Goldstein, I think Mr. Kowalski
could do with an early night.

432
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:14,880
Besides, you and I will need to be

433
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,282
up early tomorrow morning
to find my niffler, so...

434
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,868
What's a niffler?

435
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,412
Don't ask.

436
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,040
Hey, you guys can bunk in here.

437
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,059
Uh, I thought you might like a hot drink.

438
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,403
Jacob: Wow!

439
00:35:56,237 --> 00:36:00,241
Psst! Hey. Mr. Scamander, look, cocoa.

440
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,245
Toilet's down the hall to the right.

441
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,414
Thanks.

442
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,378
Very much.

443
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,069
Newt: Come on.

444
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,378
For the love...

445
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,227
Newt: Will you sit down?

446
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,355
Good idea.

447
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,278
That's definitely the murtlap.

448
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,405
You must be particularly susceptible.

449
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,741
See, you're a muggle,

450
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,243
so our physiologies are subtly different.

451
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,337
- Stay still.
- Ah...

452
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,006
That should stop the sweating.

453
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,966
And one of those should sort the twitch.

454
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,558
- Here, take that.
- Ugh...

455
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,024
Come on.

456
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,401
Whatcha got there?

457
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:02,197
This, the locals call swooping evil.

458
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,699
Not the friendliest of names.

459
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,910
It's quite an agile fella.

460
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,041
I've been studying him,
and I'm pretty sure

461
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,752
that his venom
could be quite useful if properly diluted.

462
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,254
Just to remove bad memories, you know?

463
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,431
Probably shouldn't let him
loose in here, though.

464
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,601
Come on.

465
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:49,577
Newt: Come on. Down you come.

466
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,417
Come on.

467
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,094
Thank paracelsus.

468
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:10,598
If you'd have got out,
that could've been quite catastrophic.

469
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,560
So he's the real reason I came to america.

470
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,691
To bring frank home.

471
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,021
Wait. No, sorry. Stay there.

472
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,229
He's a wee bit sensitive to strangers.

473
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,074
Here you are. Here you are.

474
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,493
He was trafficked, you see.

475
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,997
I found him in Egypt.
He was all chained up.

476
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,417
Couldn't leave him there.
I had to bring him back.

477
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,253
I'm gonna put you back
where you belong, aren't I, frank?

478
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,632
To the wilds of Arizona.

479
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,880
All right, here they come.

480
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,966
Here who comes?

481
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,343
Graphorns.

482
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,012
- Hey!
- You're all right.

483
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,642
- Jacob: Oh!
- Hello.

484
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,185
Hello.

485
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,981
So they're the last
breeding pair in existence.

486
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,776
So if I hadn't managed to rescue them,

487
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,403
that could've been
the end of graphorns forever.

488
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,660
All right.

489
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,583
Jacob: What, you rescue these creatures?

490
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,586
Newt: Yes, that's right.
Rescue, nurture and protect them.

491
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,193
And I'm gently trying to educate
my fellow wizards about them.

492
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,758
Come on.

493
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,475
Wow.

494
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,562
Titus, Finn.

495
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,523
Poppy, Marlow, Tom.

496
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,902
He had a cold.

497
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,696
He needed some body warmth.

498
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,863
Jacob: Aww...

499
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,907
All right, on you hop.

500
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,454
He has some attachment issues.

501
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,915
Now, come on, pickett.

502
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:43,835
Pickett.

503
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,754
No, they're not gonna bully you,
now come on.

504
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:48,798
Pickett.

505
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,758
All right.

506
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,304
And that is exactly why
they accuse me of favoritism.

507
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,932
Oh, no, dougal's gone.

508
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,394
All right, I'm coming. I'm coming.

509
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,479
Mum's here. Mum's here.

510
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,897
Oh, hello.

511
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,858
Let me take a look at you.

512
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,610
I know these guys.

513
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,573
Your occamy.

514
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,409
- What do you mean, my occamy?
- Yes.

515
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,453
Do you want to...

516
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,164
Oh... oh, wow, yeah, sure.

517
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,498
Okay.

518
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,964
Hey.

519
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,301
- Ahh!
- Oh, sorry, no, don't pet him.

520
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,803
They, um, learn to
defend themselves early.

521
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,690
See, their shells are made of silver,
so they're incredibly valuable.

522
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:39,849
Okay.

523
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,185
Their nests tend to get
ransacked by hunters.

524
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:43,811
Thank you.

525
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,814
Mr. Scamander?

526
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,024
Oh, call me newt.

527
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,027
Newt. I don't think I'm dreaming.

528
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,737
What gave it away?

529
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,573
I ain't got the brains to make this up.

530
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,628
Would you mind
throwing some of those pellets

531
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,288
in with the mooncalfs over there?

532
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,000
- Yeah, sure.
- Just over there 's...

533
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,005
Buggen

534
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,757
niffler's gone.

535
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,675
Course he has, little bugger.

536
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,637
Any chance to get his hands
on something shiny.

537
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,884
Jacob: What did you do today, Jacob?

538
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,678
I was inside a suitcase.

539
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,221
Hey.

540
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,889
Oh, hello, fellas.

541
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,850
All right. All right.

542
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,686
Take it easy. Take it easy.

543
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,028
Cutie.

544
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,739
There it is.

545
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,203
Newt: Step back.

546
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,496
Step back.

547
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,417
- What's the matter with this?
- I said, step away.

548
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,712
What the hell is this thing?

549
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,131
It's an obscurus.

550
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,550
I need to get going.

551
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,261
Find everyone who's escaped,
before they get hurt.

552
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,554
Before they get hurt?

553
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,805
Yes, Mr. Kowalski.

554
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,766
So they're currently in alien terrain

555
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,977
surrounded by millions of the most
vicious creatures on the planet.

556
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:33,648
Humans.

557
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:38,778
So where would you say
that a medium-sized creature

558
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,655
who likes broad open plains,

559
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,657
trees, sort of waterholes,
that sort of thing.

560
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,158
Where might she go?

561
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,493
In New York City?

562
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:47,828
- Yes.
- Plains?

563
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,122
Central park.

564
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:51,874
And where is that exactly?

565
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,334
Where is central park?

566
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,507
Well, look...

567
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:00,841
I would come and show you,

568
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,888
but don't you think it's kind
of a double-cross?

569
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,888
The girls take us in,
they make us hot cocoa...

570
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,324
Now you do realize that once they see

571
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:09,660
that you stopped sweating,
they will obliviate you in a heartbeat?

572
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:10,893
What's "bliviate" mean?

573
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,604
It'll be like you wake up
and all memory of magic gone.

574
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,876
I won't remember any of this?

575
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,910
All right, yeah, okay. I'll help you.

576
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:33,874
Come on, then.

577
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:54,228
Credence, where have you been?

578
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,942
I was looking for a place
for tomorrow's meeting.

579
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:05,114
There's a corner
on 32nd street that could...

580
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,248
I'm sorry, ma.

581
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,167
I didn't realize it was so late.

582
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,848
- I was watching you at dinner.
- Yeah.

583
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,643
People like you, don't they, Mr. Kowalski?

584
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,314
Well, I'm sure people like you, too, huh?

585
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,650
Not really, no. I annoy people.

586
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,655
Why did you decide to be a baker?

587
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,323
Well, um...

588
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:30,908
Because I'm dying

589
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,743
in that canning factory.

590
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:36,330
Everyone there's dying.
It just crushes the life out of you.

591
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,416
- Do you like canned food?
- No.

592
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,209
Yeah, me neither.

593
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:43,129
That's why I wanna make pastries.
You know, it makes people happy.

594
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,630
We're going this way.

595
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,674
So did you get your loan?

596
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,717
No.

597
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,553
I ain't got no collateral.

598
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,847
Stayed in the army too long, apparently.
I don't know.

599
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,473
You fought in the war?

600
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,743
Of course I fought in the war.
Everyone fought in the war.

601
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,353
- You didn't fight in the war?
- I worked mostly with dragons.

602
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,688
Ukrainian ironbellies.

603
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:02,523
Eastern front.

604
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,262
Fenestra.

605
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:35,556
Oh!

606
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,284
Accio.

607
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:59,139
All right. Happy?

608
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,269
One down, two to go.

609
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:15,114
They went that way, officer.

610
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,199
Hands up.

611
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:22,663
What the hell is that?

612
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:26,959
Lion.

613
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:37,511
Newt: You know,

614
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,265
New York is considerably
more interesting than I'd expected.

615
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,866
Put this on.

616
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:02,453
But why would I have to wear
something like this?

617
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,831
Because your skull is susceptible
to breakage under immense force.

618
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,437
But we made 'em cocoa.

619
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:31,940
All right.

620
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:38,405
Here, you just, um, pop this on.

621
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:40,574
Okay.

622
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:43,786
Now there's absolutely
nothing for you to worry about.

623
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,289
Tell me, has anyone ever believed you
when you told them not to worry?

624
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:50,584
Well, my philosophy is that
worrying means you suffer twice.

625
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:57,424
She's in season.

626
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,968
She needs to mate.

627
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:06,934
Erumpent musk. She's mad for it.

628
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,045
Good girl.

629
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,798
Come on.

630
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,258
Into the case.

631
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,519
Get!

632
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:39,985
Oh, no.

633
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:09,714
Reparo.

634
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,519
Merlin's beard!

635
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:19,691
Tree!

636
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:21,735
They're exactly the same.

637
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:24,488
Same thing.

638
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,031
Newt!

639
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:31,495
No, don't.

640
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:34,373
I'm so sorry.

641
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:35,017
Good show, Mr. Kowalski.

642
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,021
Call me Jacob.

643
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:50,782
Newt: Well... two down, one to go.

644
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,872
In you hop.

645
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,540
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen...

646
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,768
Tonight's keynote speaker

647
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:21,021
needs no introduction from me.

648
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,107
He's been mentioned as a future president.

649
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,319
And if you don't believe me,

650
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:28,820
just read his daddy's newspapers.

651
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:33,951
Ladies and gentlemen,

652
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:37,955
I give you the senator
for New York, Henry Shaw.

653
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:44,795
Thank you.

654
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,547
Thank you.

655
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,136
Thank you.

656
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,079
Senator Shaw: And it's true,

657
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,540
we have made some progress.

658
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:25,252
But there is no reward for idleness.

659
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:30,716
So just as the odious saloons
have been banished...

660
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:47,149
So now the pool halls,

661
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,860
and these private parlors...

662
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:02,914
What is that?

663
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,308
Shaw senior: No! No!

664
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:54,883
Vvflches.

665
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,436
Heinrich: Ouramerican friends
have permitted a breach

666
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:11,483
of the statute of secrecy that
threatens to expose us all.

667
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,068
I will not be lectured by the man

668
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,445
who let gellert Grindelwald
slip through his fingers.

669
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:19,574
Madam president, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but this is critical...

670
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,732
Seraphina: You better have
an excellent excuse

671
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,758
for this intrusion, Ms. Goldstein.

672
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:39,553
Yes. I do.

673
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:43,890
Ma 'am,

674
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:48,562
yesterday a wizard entered New York
with a case, this case,

675
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:49,896
full of magical creatures.

676
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,107
And unfortunately, some have escaped.

677
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,151
He arrived yesterday?

678
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,779
You've known for 24 hours

679
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:01,867
that an unregistered wizard
set magical beasts loose in New York,

680
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,661
and you see fit to tell us
only when a man has been killed?

681
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,456
Who's been killed?

682
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,876
Where is this man?

683
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,250
British envoy: Scamander?

684
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:56,338
Oh, hello, minister.

685
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,631
Momolu: Theseus scamander?

686
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:58,965
The war hero?

687
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,009
No. This is his little brother.

688
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:03,678
And what are you doing in New York?

689
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:05,805
I came to buy an appaloosa puffskein, sir.

690
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,182
Right.

691
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,808
What are you really doing here?

692
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,436
Seraph I na: Goldstein,

693
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:12,812
who is this?

694
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,372
This is Jacob Kowalski, madam president.

695
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:18,068
He's a no-maj who got bitten
by one of Mr. Scamander's creatures.

696
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,487
Witch: No-maj? Obliviate him.

697
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:22,113
Wizard: Obliviate him.

698
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,160
Merlin's beard.

699
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:31,498
You know which of your creatures
was responsible, Mr. Scamander?

700
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:38,046
No creature did this.

701
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:40,757
Don't pretend.

702
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:43,426
You must know what that was.
Look at the marks.

703
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,706
That was an obscurus.

704
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,896
Seraphina: You go too far, Mr. Scamander.

705
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:58,358
There is no obscurial in america.

706
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:02,862
Impound that case, graves.

707
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,545
- Wait, no. Give that back.
- Arrest them.

708
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,539
Don't hurt those creatures.

709
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,542
Please. You don't understand.
Nothing in there's dangerous.

710
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,877
- Nothing.
- We'll be the judges of that.

711
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:19,713
Take them to the cells.

712
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,967
Don't hurt those creatures.
Nothing in there is dangerous.

713
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,587
Please don't hurt my creatures.
They aren't dangerous!

714
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:28,638
Please! They're not dangerous!

715
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:30,765
They're not dangerous!

716
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,526
I'm so sorry about your creatures,
Mr. Scamander.

717
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:43,862
I truly am.

718
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:46,779
Can someone please tell me

719
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:50,076
what this obscurial,
obscurius thing is, please?

720
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,414
There hasn't been one for centuries.

721
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,793
I met one in Sudan three months ago.

722
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,840
There used to be more of them,
but they still exist.

723
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:09,429
It was before wizards went underground,

724
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:13,099
when we were still
being hunted by Muggles.

725
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:17,896
Young wizards and witches
sometimes tried to suppress their magic

726
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:19,606
to avoid persecution.

727
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:24,611
So, instead of learning to harness
or to control their powers,

728
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,948
they developed
what was called an obscurus.

729
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,162
It's an unstable,
uncontrollable dark force

730
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:36,331
that busts out and attacks.

731
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,336
And then vanishes.

732
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,342
Obscurials can't survive long, can they?

733
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:51,805
There's no documented case of an obscurial
surviving past the age of10.

734
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,725
The one I met in Africa was 8 when she...

735
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,148
She was 8 when she died.

736
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:06,986
What are you telling me here?

737
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,949
That senator Shaw was killed by a kid?

738
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,833
My momma, your momma
flying on a switch

739
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,503
my momma, your momma
witches never cry

740
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,965
my momma, your momma
witches gonna die

741
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:30,844
witch number one, drown in the river

742
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,721
witch number two, got a noose...

743
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,723
Chastity: Hand out your leaflets.

744
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,184
I'll know if you dump them.

745
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,563
Tell me if you see anything suspicious.

746
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:13,720
It was good to make
your acquaintance, Jacob.

747
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:16,055
And I hope you get your bakery.

748
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:29,253
Graves: You're an interesting man,
Mr. Scamander.

749
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:30,695
Mr. Graves.

750
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,582
You were thrown out of Hogwarts
for endangering human life.

751
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:44,918
- That was an accident.
- With a beast.

752
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:49,255
Yet one of your teachers argued strongly
against your expulsion.

753
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:50,590
Now,

754
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,844
what makes Albus Dumbledore

755
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:57,180
so fond of you?

756
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:03,686
I really couldn't say.

757
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,940
So setting a pack
of dangerous creatures loose here was

758
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:12,904
just another accident. Is that right?

759
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,103
Why would I do it deliberately?

760
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,242
To expose wizardkind.

761
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:21,120
To provoke war between
the magical and non-magical worlds.

762
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:24,832
Mass slaughter
for the greater good, you mean?

763
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,461
Yes.

764
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:30,713
Quite.

765
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:35,635
I'm not one of Grindelwald's
fanatics, Mr. Graves.

766
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:43,560
I wonder what you can tell me
about this, Mr. Scamander.

767
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,367
It's an obscurus.

768
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,160
But it's not what you think.

769
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,246
I managed to separate it
from the Sudanese girl

770
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:04,497
as I tried to save her.

771
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,624
So I wanted to take it home to study it.

772
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,209
But it cannot survive outside that.

773
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:10,169
It could not hurt anyone, Tina.

774
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:12,297
So it's useless without the host?

775
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,507
Useless?

776
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,176
Useless?

777
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:23,891
That is a parasitical,
magical force that killed a child.

778
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:26,144
What on earth would you use it for?

779
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,694
You fool nobody, Mr. Scamander.

780
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:36,672
You brought this obscurus
into the city of New York

781
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:38,615
in the hope of causing mass disruption,

782
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:41,659
breaking the statute of secrecy
and revealing the magical world.

783
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,137
You know that can't hurt anyone.
You know that.

784
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,972
You are therefore guilty of
a treasonous betrayal

785
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:47,040
of your fellow wizards
and are sentenced to death.

786
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:49,629
Miss Goldstein,
who has aided and abetted you...

787
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:51,210
No, she's done nothing of the kind.

788
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,212
Receives the same sentence.

789
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,924
Just do it immediately.

790
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,260
- I will inform president picquery myself.
- Tina.

791
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:01,220
Shh.

792
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:02,555
Please.

793
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:18,905
Don't do this, Bernadette. Please.

794
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:21,741
It don't hurt.

795
01:09:58,903 --> 01:09:59,946
Tina's mother: Tina.

796
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,197
Momma?

797
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,741
Tina.

798
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,870
Come on, pumpkin. Time for bed.

799
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:09,956
Are you ready?

800
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:12,792
Don't that look good?

801
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:18,673
You wanna get in, huh?

802
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:28,933
Hey, Sam.

803
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,780
- Hey, queenie.
- They need you downstairs.

804
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:32,061
I'll obliviate this guy.

805
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,604
You ain't qualified.

806
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:36,524
Hey, Sam.

807
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:38,860
Does cecily know you been seeing Ruby?

808
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:42,965
- How did you...
- Let me obliviate this guy,

809
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,699
and she'll never hear about it from me.

810
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:49,996
What are you doing?

811
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:52,665
Hush. Teen's in trouble.
I'm trying to listen.

812
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:54,375
Jacob, where's newt's case?

813
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:56,461
I think that guy graves took it.

814
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,379
Okay. Come on.

815
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,339
What, you're not gonna obliviate me?

816
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:04,135
Of course not. You're one of us now.

817
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,767
Tina's mother: Tina.

818
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,915
It's okay.

819
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,009
Queenie: Alohomora.

820
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,055
Aberto.

821
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:52,391
He would know
some fancy spell to lock his office.

822
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:58,606
Okay, let's get the good stuff outta you.

823
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:20,002
Witch!

824
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:32,265
Mr. Scamander!

825
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:34,100
Don't panic.

826
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,893
What do you suggest I do instead?

827
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:42,400
Jump.

828
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,237
Are you crazy?

829
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:48,239
Jump on him.

830
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,743
Tina, listen to me.

831
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:54,453
I'll catch you.

832
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:56,747
Tina.

833
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,213
I'll catch you.

834
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:06,841
I've got you, Tina.

835
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:09,343
Go!

836
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,516
Come on.

837
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:37,663
Leave his brains. Come on. Come on!

838
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:41,834
What is that thing?

839
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,085
Swooping evil.

840
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,879
Well, I love it.

841
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:00,436
Get in.

842
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:12,615
Mr. Abernathy: Queenie!

843
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:19,205
Where you going?

844
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:21,707
I, uh...

845
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:23,793
I'm sick, Mr. Abernathy.

846
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,046
Again?

847
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:28,381
Oh. Uh...

848
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:30,216
Whatcha got there?

849
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,760
Ladies' things.

850
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:35,471
You wanna take a look? I don't mind.

851
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:39,266
Good gravy. No. I, uh...

852
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:41,769
You get well now.

853
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,021
Thanks.

854
01:14:58,077 --> 01:14:59,870
Credence, have you found the child?

855
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:03,290
I can't.

856
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:05,751
Show me.

857
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,180
My boy, the sooner we find this child,

858
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:21,600
the sooner you can put that pain
in the past where it belongs.

859
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:25,813
I want you to have this, credence.

860
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:30,067
I would trust very few with it.

861
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:33,738
Very few.

862
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,117
But you...

863
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:41,996
You're different.

864
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,291
And when you find the child,
you touch this symbol,

865
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,501
and I will know and I will come to you.

866
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:53,299
Do this, and you will be honored

867
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,136
among wizards forever.

868
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,974
The child is dying, credence.

869
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,563
Time is running out.

870
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:22,536
Your grandfather kept pigeons?

871
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:24,038
Mine bred owls.

872
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:27,333
I used to love feeding them.

873
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:31,420
Tina: Graves always insisted
the disturbances were caused by a beast.

874
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,106
We need to catch all your creatures

875
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,216
so he can't
keep using them as a scapegoat.

876
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,259
There's only one still missing.

877
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,844
Dougal, my demiguise.

878
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:40,763
Dougal?

879
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:44,850
Slight problem is that,
um, he's invisible.

880
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,146
- Invisible?
- Yes.

881
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,690
Most of the time. He does, um...

882
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:57,363
- How do you catch something...
- With immense difficulty.

883
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:08,791
Gnarlak.

884
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,876
- Excuse me?
- Gnarlak.

885
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:14,046
He was an informant of mine
when I was an auror.

886
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:17,633
He used to trade
in magical creatures on the side.

887
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:21,220
He wouldn't happen to have an interest
in paw prints, would he?

888
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,975
He's interested in anything he can sell.

889
01:17:58,549 --> 01:18:00,217
Tears of Pearl

890
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:05,222
when the dragon
snapped up his best girl

891
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:09,310
and the billywig forgot to twirl

892
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:13,981
when his sweetheart left him cold

893
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:18,819
the unicorn done lost his horn

894
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:21,363
and the hippogriff...

895
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,290
How's a guy
get a drink in thisjoint?

896
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:27,086
What? Ain't you ever seen
a house-elf before?

897
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:31,582
Uh, no, of course I have.
I love house-eres.

898
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:33,667
My uncle is a house-elf.

899
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:36,629
Yeah.

900
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:42,426
Six shots of gigglewater
and a lobe-blaster, please.

901
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:51,977
Are all no-majs like you?

902
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:55,648
No. I'm the only one like me.

903
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,543
I've arrested half of the people in here.

904
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:18,647
You can tell me to mind my business,

905
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:22,549
but I saw something
in that death potion back there.

906
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,679
I saw you hugging that second Salem boy.

907
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:29,348
His name's credence.

908
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:32,309
His mother beats him.

909
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:36,705
She beats all those kids she's adopted,

910
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:39,024
but she seems to hate him the most.

911
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:42,861
And she was the no-maj you attacked?

912
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:46,240
That's how I lost my job.

913
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:50,202
I went for her in front of a meeting
of her crazy followers.

914
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:53,038
They all had to be obliviated.

915
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:54,373
It was a big scandal.

916
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,083
It's him.

917
01:19:57,001 --> 01:20:01,046
'Cause love
drives all of us wild

918
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:06,385
So...

919
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:11,724
You're the guy
with the case full of monsters, huh?

920
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,350
News travels fast.

921
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:18,981
I was hoping you'd be able to tell me
if there've been any sightings.

922
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:21,608
Tracks, that sort of thing.

923
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:27,031
You got a pretty big price
on your head, Mr. Scamander.

924
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:29,575
Why should I help you

925
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:32,036
instead of turning you in?

926
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:34,413
I take it I'll have to
make it worth your while.

927
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:38,042
Um... let's consider it a cover charge.

928
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,425
Macusa's offering more than that.

929
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,096
Lunascope?

930
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,434
Igotfive.

931
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,318
Frozen ashwinder egg.

932
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:05,986
Oh, you see, now we're...

933
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:08,697
Wait a minute.

934
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:12,284
That's a...

935
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:13,952
That's a bowtruckle.

936
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,288
Right?

937
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:17,664
- No.
- Oh, come on.

938
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:19,541
They pick locks, am I right?

939
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:21,335
You're not having him.

940
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,129
Well...

941
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:28,342
Good luck getting back alive,
Mr. Scamander,

942
01:21:28,509 --> 01:21:30,302
what with the whole of macusa
on your back.

943
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:34,098
Newt: All right.

944
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:44,066
Pickett.

945
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:48,362
Gnarlak: Oh...

946
01:21:56,662 --> 01:22:00,165
Something invisible's been
wreaking havoc around 5th Avenue.

947
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:03,043
You may want to check out
Macy's department store.

948
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:04,902
Might have what you're looking for.

949
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:06,046
Dougal

950
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:07,506
one last thing.

951
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:11,051
There's a Mr. Graves who works at macusa.

952
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:13,971
I was wondering what you knew
of his background.

953
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:18,475
You ask a lot of questions, Mr. Scamander.

954
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:21,353
That can get you killed.

955
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:26,316
Macusa are comin'.

956
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:27,860
You tipped them off?

957
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:37,911
Sorry, Mr. Gnarlak.

958
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,207
He reminds me of my foreman.

959
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:15,810
Modesty: Whatcha doin', credence?

960
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:24,530
Credence: Where'd you get this?

961
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,126
Give it back, credence.

962
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:28,045
It's just a toy.

963
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:34,259
What is this?

964
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:39,932
Take it off.

965
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:07,709
_ma__ -i am not your ma.

966
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:11,463
Your mother

967
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,967
was a wicked, unnatural woman.

968
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:17,761
It was mine.

969
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:20,514
Modesty.

970
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:34,820
What is this?

971
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:30,000
Demiguise are
fundamentally peaceful,

972
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:32,836
but they can give a nasty nip if provoked.

973
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:35,839
You two,

974
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:37,549
head that way.

975
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:40,218
And try very hard not to be predictable.

976
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:47,851
Tina: Was that the demiguise?
Newt: No.

977
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:50,604
But I think it might be the reason
that the demiguise is here.

978
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:08,080
Newt: Its sight operates on probability,

979
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:11,416
so it can foresee
the most likely immediate future.

980
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:14,961
Tina: What's it doing?

981
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:17,839
Newt: He's babysitting.

982
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,717
What did you just say?

983
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:21,927
Newt: This is my fault.

984
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:27,933
I thought I had them all
but, uh, I must have miscounted.

985
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:33,939
It was babysitting that?

986
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:49,871
Occamies are choranaptyxic.

987
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:53,500
So they grow to fill available space.

988
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,423
Mummy's here.

989
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:14,646
Whoa. Whoa!

990
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:16,815
Whoa!

991
01:27:20,527 --> 01:27:23,029
- We need an insect!
- Huh?

992
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:25,574
Any kind of insect and a teapot.

993
01:27:27,117 --> 01:27:28,577
Find a teapot!

994
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:34,875
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

995
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:51,016
Oh! No!

996
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:53,226
I got it! I'll get it!

997
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:57,856
Teapot!

998
01:28:11,411 --> 01:28:13,705
Roach in teapot.

999
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,262
Choranaptyxic.

1000
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:14,266
They also shrink
to fit the available space.

1001
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:21,147
Tell me the truth.

1002
01:29:22,983 --> 01:29:25,026
Was that everything
that came out of the case?

1003
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:27,279
That's everything.

1004
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,156
And that's the truth.

1005
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:35,328
Newt: Here she comes.

1006
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:38,331
You happy to be home? Yeah.

1007
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:40,041
Bet you're exhausted, buddy. Come on.

1008
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:41,608
Just place him in the middle there.

1009
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:43,753
There you go. That's right.

1010
01:30:10,113 --> 01:30:11,281
Right.

1011
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:13,325
I think we need to talk.

1012
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:20,165
Iwouldn't have let him keep you, pickett.

1013
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:22,935
Think I would rather chop off my hand
than get rid of you

1014
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:25,337
after everything that you've done for me.
Now, come on.

1015
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:29,591
Think we've talked about
the sulking before, haven't we?

1016
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:31,676
Pickett?

1017
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:35,347
Come on, give me a smile.

1018
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:37,444
Pickett, give me a...

1019
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:40,185
All right.

1020
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:42,187
Now that is beneath you.

1021
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:51,237
Hey, newt.

1022
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:54,741
Who is she?

1023
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:56,785
Oh, that's no one.

1024
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:00,538
Leta Lestrange.

1025
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:03,541
I've heard of that family.

1026
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,629
Aren't they kind of, you know...

1027
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:09,714
Please don't read my mind.

1028
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:22,852
Sorry, I asked you not to.

1029
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:25,480
I know. I'm sorry.

1030
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:27,857
I can't help it.

1031
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:31,069
People are easiest to read
when they're hurting.

1032
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:32,362
I'm not hurting.

1033
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:35,949
Anyway, it was a long time ago.

1034
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:47,669
That was a real close friendship
you had at school.

1035
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,632
Neither of us really fitted in at school.

1036
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:56,594
- So, we became quite...
- You became real close?

1037
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:00,098
For years.

1038
01:32:04,394 --> 01:32:05,770
She was a taker.

1039
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:09,274
You need a giver.

1040
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:11,943
What are you two talking about?

1041
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:14,029
N ewt: Uh, nothing.

1042
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:15,822
Queenie: School.

1043
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:17,615
- School.
- Did...

1044
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:19,784
Did you say school?

1045
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:21,953
Is there a school?

1046
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:25,498
A wizardry school here in, uh, america?

1047
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:27,709
Of course. Llvermorny.

1048
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:30,462
It's only the best wizard school
in the whole world.

1049
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:34,299
I think you'll find that the best
wizarding school in the world is Hogwarts.

1050
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:36,176
Hogwash.

1051
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:47,645
Newt: Danger.

1052
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:52,650
He senses danger.

1053
01:33:32,482 --> 01:33:34,984
The obscurial was here.

1054
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:36,528
Where did she go?

1055
01:33:39,405 --> 01:33:40,698
Help me.

1056
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:43,409
Help me.

1057
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:48,289
Didn't you tell me you had another sister?

1058
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,709
Please, help me.

1059
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:54,504
- Where's your other sister, credence?
- I need help.

1060
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:56,548
The little one. Where did she go?

1061
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:58,675
Please, just help me.

1062
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:03,721
Your sister's in grave danger.

1063
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:06,599
We need to find her.

1064
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:17,443
Graves: What is this place?

1065
01:34:17,777 --> 01:34:19,946
Credence: Ma adopted modesty out of here.

1066
01:34:20,113 --> 01:34:21,739
From a family of 12.

1067
01:34:22,574 --> 01:34:25,785
She misses her brothers and sisters.
She still talks about them.

1068
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:29,747
Where is she?

1069
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:32,750
I don't know.

1070
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:35,879
You're a squib, credence.

1071
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:39,674
I could smell it off you
the minute I met you.

1072
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:41,926
What?

1073
01:34:43,595 --> 01:34:45,847
You have magical ancestry but no power.

1074
01:34:46,973 --> 01:34:48,433
But you said you could teach me.

1075
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:49,851
You're unteachable.

1076
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:51,519
Your mother's dead.

1077
01:34:52,312 --> 01:34:53,605
That's your reward.

1078
01:34:54,981 --> 01:34:56,441
I'm done with you.

1079
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:06,576
Modesty?

1080
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,006
Modesty.

1081
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:25,303
There's no need to be afraid.

1082
01:35:27,096 --> 01:35:29,349
I'm here with your brother, credence.

1083
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:36,022
Out you come now.

1084
01:36:11,307 --> 01:36:12,350
Credence.

1085
01:36:13,726 --> 01:36:15,937
I owe you an apology.

1086
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:18,564
I trusted you.

1087
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:23,236
I thought you were my friend.

1088
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:25,530
I thought you were different.

1089
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:29,367
You can control it.

1090
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:31,619
Credence.

1091
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:39,335
I don't think I want to, Mr. Graves.

1092
01:37:04,902 --> 01:37:07,280
Jacob: Is that it?
That's the obscurial thing?

1093
01:37:09,324 --> 01:37:11,784
That's more powerful
than any obscurial I've ever heard of.

1094
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,874
If I don't come back,

1095
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:19,500
look after my creatures.

1096
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:23,463
Everything that you need to know
is in there.

1097
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:25,840
What?

1098
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,800
They're not killing it.

1099
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:31,471
Newt!

1100
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:34,307
You heard him. Look after them.

1101
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:37,602
Keep hold of that, honey.

1102
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:40,730
No, no, no, no.

1103
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:42,774
I can't take you.

1104
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:46,778
- Please, let go of me, Jacob.
- Hey. Hey.

1105
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:49,280
You're the one
that said I was one of yous.

1106
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:50,615
Right?

1107
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:52,617
It's too dangerous.

1108
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:24,649
Graves: To survive so long

1109
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:28,319
with this inside you, credence,

1110
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:30,822
is a miracle.

1111
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:33,658
You are a miracle.

1112
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:36,369
Come with me.

1113
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:39,664
Think of what we could achieve together.

1114
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:55,179
Tina: Newt!

1115
01:38:55,555 --> 01:38:57,355
It's the second Salem boy.
He's the obscurial.

1116
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,142
He's not a child.

1117
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:03,688
His power must be so strong
he's somehow managed to survive.

1118
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:09,360
Tina: Newt.

1119
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:11,737
Save him.

1120
01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:20,455
Tina: Mr. Graves.

1121
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:35,845
Tina, you're always turning up
where you're least wanted.

1122
01:39:48,483 --> 01:39:49,984
Seraphina: Contain this.

1123
01:39:50,526 --> 01:39:53,112
Or we are exposed, and it” mean war.

1124
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:05,249
Credence.

1125
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:07,126
Credence, I can help.

1126
01:41:46,684 --> 01:41:47,995
- Bar the area.
- Auror: Yes, sir.

1127
01:41:48,019 --> 01:41:49,459
I don't want anyone else down there.

1128
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:03,409
Newt: Credence...

1129
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:08,122
It is credence, isn't it?

1130
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:13,544
I'm here to help you, credence.

1131
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:16,797
I'm not here to hurt you.

1132
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:39,070
I've met someone just like you, credence.

1133
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:43,658
A girl.

1134
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:46,160
A young girl

1135
01:42:46,577 --> 01:42:48,162
who'd been imprisoned.

1136
01:42:49,872 --> 01:42:54,085
She had been locked away,
and she'd been punished for her magic.

1137
01:43:12,228 --> 01:43:13,437
Credence.

1138
01:43:16,774 --> 01:43:18,150
Can I come over to you?

1139
01:43:21,821 --> 01:43:23,239
Can I come over?

1140
01:43:52,852 --> 01:43:54,937
That thing killed my son.

1141
01:43:55,146 --> 01:43:56,814
I want justice.

1142
01:43:57,648 --> 01:44:01,694
I'll expose you
for who you are and what you've done.

1143
01:44:25,009 --> 01:44:26,969
Look! Take photos.

1144
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:56,123
Credence...

1145
01:45:35,412 --> 01:45:36,872
Credence, no!

1146
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:44,088
Don't do this.

1147
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:46,090
Please.

1148
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:49,009
Newt: Keep talking, Tina.

1149
01:45:50,636 --> 01:45:52,721
Keep talking to him. He'll listen to you.

1150
01:45:53,222 --> 01:45:54,473
He's listening.

1151
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:59,562
I know what that woman did to you.

1152
01:46:03,983 --> 01:46:06,151
I know that you've suffered.

1153
01:46:08,487 --> 01:46:11,031
You need to stop this now.

1154
01:46:12,992 --> 01:46:15,369
Newt and I will protect you.

1155
01:46:17,955 --> 01:46:19,123
This man,

1156
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:21,625
he's using you.

1157
01:46:21,959 --> 01:46:23,479
Graves: Don't listen to her, credence.

1158
01:46:24,503 --> 01:46:26,171
I want you to be free.

1159
01:46:27,631 --> 01:46:28,674
It's all right.

1160
01:46:30,342 --> 01:46:31,635
That's it.

1161
01:46:39,768 --> 01:46:40,811
Shh!

1162
01:46:41,604 --> 01:46:42,646
Don 't!

1163
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:44,533
- You'll frighten him!
- Graves: Wands down!

1164
01:46:45,149 --> 01:46:46,589
Anyone harms him, they answer to me.

1165
01:46:46,942 --> 01:46:48,944
- Credence.
- Credence.

1166
01:46:51,071 --> 01:46:52,072
Tina and newt: No!

1167
01:46:52,364 --> 01:46:53,532
Graves: No!

1168
01:47:28,025 --> 01:47:29,234
Graves: Credence.

1169
01:47:30,611 --> 01:47:32,029
You fools.

1170
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:35,866
Do you realize what you've done?

1171
01:47:36,617 --> 01:47:39,578
Seraphina: The obscurial was killed
on my orders, Mr. Graves.

1172
01:47:39,745 --> 01:47:41,038
Graves: Yes.

1173
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:43,832
And history will surely note that,
madam president.

1174
01:47:45,501 --> 01:47:47,141
What was done here tonight was not right.

1175
01:47:47,252 --> 01:47:49,922
He was responsible
for the death of a no-maj.

1176
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:52,049
He risked the exposure of our community.

1177
01:47:52,216 --> 01:47:53,896
He has broken one of our most sacred laws.

1178
01:47:54,051 --> 01:47:57,680
A law that has us scuttling
like rats in the gutter.

1179
01:47:58,055 --> 01:48:00,057
A law that demands that
we conceal our true nature.

1180
01:48:00,724 --> 01:48:03,560
A law that directs those
under its dominion to cower in fear,

1181
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:05,688
lest we risk discovery.

1182
01:48:08,148 --> 01:48:10,275
I ask you, madam president,

1183
01:48:12,069 --> 01:48:13,570
lask all of you...

1184
01:48:15,739 --> 01:48:17,616
Who does this law protect?

1185
01:48:23,247 --> 01:48:24,623
Or them?

1186
01:48:31,714 --> 01:48:33,757
I refuse to bow down any longer.

1187
01:48:33,924 --> 01:48:35,009
Seraphina: Aurors,

1188
01:48:35,843 --> 01:48:38,345
I'd like you to relieve Mr. Graves
of his wand

1189
01:48:38,512 --> 01:48:39,888
and escort him back...

1190
01:49:13,672 --> 01:49:15,049
Accio!

1191
01:49:24,516 --> 01:49:25,726
Re velio.

1192
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:53,337
Do you think you can hold me?

1193
01:49:55,172 --> 01:49:58,342
We'll do our best, Mr. Grindelwald.

1194
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:19,321
Will we diejust a little?

1195
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:31,542
Hey.

1196
01:50:32,751 --> 01:50:35,879
I figured somebody ought to
keep an eye on this thing.

1197
01:50:40,551 --> 01:50:41,552
Thank you.

1198
01:50:41,718 --> 01:50:44,388
We owe you an apology, Mr. Scamander,

1199
01:50:45,305 --> 01:50:47,724
but the magical community is exposed.

1200
01:50:48,642 --> 01:50:51,228
We cannot obliviate an entire city.

1201
01:50:56,525 --> 01:50:57,776
Newt: Actually,

1202
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:00,737
I think we can.

1203
01:51:26,722 --> 01:51:29,558
I was intending to wait
until we got to Arizona.

1204
01:51:32,895 --> 01:51:35,689
But it seems that now
you're our only hope, frank.

1205
01:51:54,875 --> 01:51:56,460
Newt: I'll miss you, too.

1206
01:52:08,931 --> 01:52:10,390
You know what you gotta do.

1207
01:54:38,246 --> 01:54:39,790
N ewt: They won't remember anything.

1208
01:54:40,957 --> 01:54:44,336
That venom has incredibly powerful
obliviative properties.

1209
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:49,132
We owe you a great debt, Mr. Scamander.

1210
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:53,387
Now,

1211
01:54:53,553 --> 01:54:55,680
get that case out of New York.

1212
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,808
Yes, madam president.

1213
01:55:04,314 --> 01:55:05,982
Is that no-maj still here?

1214
01:55:11,154 --> 01:55:12,489
Obliviate him.

1215
01:55:12,656 --> 01:55:14,116
There can be no exceptions.

1216
01:55:16,493 --> 01:55:18,912
I'm sorry, but even one witness...

1217
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:20,163
You know the law.

1218
01:55:24,459 --> 01:55:26,336
I'll let you say goodbye.

1219
01:55:37,514 --> 01:55:38,640
Hey.

1220
01:55:41,309 --> 01:55:42,310
This is for the best.

1221
01:55:43,645 --> 01:55:45,522
Yeah. I was...

1222
01:55:46,773 --> 01:55:48,817
I was never even supposed to be here.

1223
01:55:49,776 --> 01:55:51,570
I was never supposed to know

1224
01:55:53,530 --> 01:55:54,865
any of this.

1225
01:55:59,536 --> 01:56:01,913
Everybody knows newt only
kept me around because...

1226
01:56:03,832 --> 01:56:04,875
Hey,

1227
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:08,044
newt, why did you keep me around?

1228
01:56:09,629 --> 01:56:11,047
Because I like you.

1229
01:56:13,467 --> 01:56:15,343
Because you're my friend.

1230
01:56:16,678 --> 01:56:19,097
And I'll never forget
how you helped me, Jacob.

1231
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:21,725
Oh...

1232
01:56:22,434 --> 01:56:23,435
Hey...

1233
01:56:23,894 --> 01:56:25,103
I'll come with you.

1234
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:28,899
We'll go somewhere. We'll go anywhere.

1235
01:56:30,233 --> 01:56:31,443
See,

1236
01:56:31,693 --> 01:56:34,488
I ain't never gonna find anyone like you.

1237
01:56:37,407 --> 01:56:38,575
There's loads like me.

1238
01:56:43,079 --> 01:56:44,873
There's only one like you.

1239
01:56:51,087 --> 01:56:52,589
I gotta go.

1240
01:56:57,469 --> 01:56:58,553
Jacob_.

1241
01:56:59,471 --> 01:57:01,097
It's okay. It's okay.

1242
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:05,477
It's okay.

1243
01:57:10,023 --> 01:57:12,025
It's just like waking up, right?

1244
01:59:15,315 --> 01:59:16,875
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

1245
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:35,502
Newt: Dear Mr. Kowalski.

1246
01:59:35,877 --> 01:59:38,338
You are wasted in a canning factory.

1247
01:59:41,591 --> 01:59:44,969
Please take these occamy eggshells
as collateral for your bakery.

1248
01:59:45,136 --> 01:59:46,596
A well-wisher.

1249
02:00:08,284 --> 02:00:09,411
Well...

1250
02:00:10,286 --> 02:00:12,664
- It's been, um...
- Hasn't it?

1251
02:00:16,793 --> 02:00:18,545
Listen, newt, uh...

1252
02:00:19,504 --> 02:00:21,047
I wanted to thank you.

1253
02:00:21,631 --> 02:00:23,007
What on earth for?

1254
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:25,301
Well, you know...

1255
02:00:26,261 --> 02:00:28,656
If you hadn't said all those nice things
to madam picquery about me,

1256
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:31,307
I wouldn't be back
on the investigative team now.

1257
02:00:32,809 --> 02:00:36,146
I can't think of anyone
that I'd rather have investigating me.

1258
02:00:39,107 --> 02:00:41,276
Try not to need investigating for a bit.

1259
02:00:42,902 --> 02:00:45,280
A quiet life for me from now on.

1260
02:00:45,447 --> 02:00:46,781
Back to the ministry.

1261
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:48,408
Deliver my manuscript.

1262
02:00:48,658 --> 02:00:50,160
I'll look out for it.

1263
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:53,580
Fantastic beasts and where to find them.

1264
02:00:59,502 --> 02:01:01,671
Does leta Lestrange like to read?

1265
02:01:02,922 --> 02:01:04,340
Who?

1266
02:01:05,967 --> 02:01:08,178
The girl whose picture you carry.

1267
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:13,558
I don't really know
what leta likes these days.

1268
02:01:14,851 --> 02:01:16,519
- Oh.
- 'Cause people change.

1269
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:19,272
- Yes.
- I've changed.

1270
02:01:20,982 --> 02:01:22,317
I think. Uh...

1271
02:01:23,359 --> 02:01:24,778
Maybe a little.

1272
02:01:34,746 --> 02:01:36,873
I'll send you a copy of my book, if I may.

1273
02:01:37,749 --> 02:01:39,250
I'd like that.

1274
02:01:57,727 --> 02:02:02,649
I'm so sorry. How would you feel
if I gave you your copy in person?

1275
02:02:05,401 --> 02:02:06,736
I'd like that.

1276
02:02:09,948 --> 02:02:11,574
Very much.

1277
02:03:28,693 --> 02:03:31,613
Where'd you get your ideas
from, Mr. Kowalski?

1278
02:03:31,821 --> 02:03:33,489
I don't know. I don't know.

1279
02:03:34,908 --> 02:03:36,534
They just come.

1280
02:03:36,951 --> 02:03:38,953
Here you go. Don't forget this.

1281
02:03:39,329 --> 02:03:40,496
Enjoy.

1282
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:42,540
Hey! Hendry.

1283
02:03:42,707 --> 02:03:45,335
Storage, all right? Thanks, pal.

1284
02:12:49,253 --> 02:12:50,254
English - sdh
