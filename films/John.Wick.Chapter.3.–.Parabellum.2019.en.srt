1
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,750
John Wick, Excommunicado.

2
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,586
In effect, 6:00 p.m.,
Eastern Standard Time.

3
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,849
I do hope that Mr. Wick
finds his way to safety.

4
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,809
He knew the rules, he broke them.

5
00:03:05,142 --> 00:03:07,144
He killed a man
on company grounds, Charon.

6
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,522
Do you expect him to make it out?

7
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:11,357
$14 million bounty on his head.

8
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,360
Every interested party in this city
wants a piece of it.

9
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,279
I'd say the odds are about even.

10
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,216
You think
the hospital's there to help, man?

11
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,300
No way!

12
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:42,429
They'll kill you
just as soon as they'll make you better.

13
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:46,224
But I know better, man.
I know better. I know what I'm...

14
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:56,859
Tick tock, Mr. Wick. Tick tock.

15
00:03:57,526 --> 00:04:01,697
Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick...

16
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:04,992
No time to dilly-dally, Mr. Wick!

17
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:21,592
The New York Public Library.

18
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:22,676
You got it.

19
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:43,489
Change of plan.

20
00:04:46,492 --> 00:04:47,659
To the Continental.

21
00:04:48,118 --> 00:04:50,703
Can you see that he's received
by the concierge?

22
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:53,039
Yes, sir, Mr. Wick.

23
00:04:54,707 --> 00:04:57,919
Good dog. Good dog.

24
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:12,225
John Wick, Excommunicado.
In effect, 20 minutes.

25
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,080
Can I help you?

26
00:05:34,163 --> 00:05:37,332
Russian Folktale. Alexander Afanasyev.

27
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:41,294
1864.

28
00:05:51,388 --> 00:05:52,848
-Level two.
-Thank you.

29
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,572
"Consider your origins.

30
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:53,909
You were not made to live as brutes,
but to follow virtue and knowledge."

31
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,831
Dante.

32
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,544
Looking a little run down there, John.

33
00:07:05,086 --> 00:07:07,797
Ernest. I still have time.

34
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:10,717
It's almost up.
Who's gonna know the difference?

35
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:13,261
You sure this is what you wanna do?

36
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:15,096
Fourteen million. It's a lot of money.

37
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,222
Not if you can't spend it.

38
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:54,177
Oh, shit.

39
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:47,897
Push it back.

40
00:09:02,704 --> 00:09:07,208
John Wick, Excommunicado.
In effect, 10 minutes.

41
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,972
Let it be known the Bowery
will honor the Excommunicado.

42
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:25,435
No help, no services of any kind.

43
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,991
Doc! Doc, it's Wick!

44
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:42,786
Mr. Wick.

45
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:45,330
No, no. You shouldn't be here.
Hour's almost up.

46
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:47,081
I know, Doc, please. There's still time.

47
00:09:47,164 --> 00:09:48,582
No. I can't.

48
00:09:48,665 --> 00:09:50,041
I still have five minutes.

49
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,793
Please.

50
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:00,759
Come on. Come on.

51
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,642
All right, sit there.

52
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,523
All right, let me see. Let me see.

53
00:10:19,026 --> 00:10:20,653
Puncture wound.

54
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,448
Went deep. Nicked the artery.

55
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:27,284
Here you go.

56
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,371
All right.

57
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,128
John Wick, Excommunicado.
In effect, one minute.

58
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:52,308
Doc?

59
00:10:57,313 --> 00:10:58,314
Doc?

60
00:10:58,398 --> 00:10:59,898
Yeah. We're halfway there.

61
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:04,277
-Five seconds.
-Yeah.

62
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,863
John Wick, Excommunicado.

63
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:10,992
In effect, in five, four...

64
00:11:11,617 --> 00:11:13,994
Three, two...

65
00:11:14,452 --> 00:11:15,871
One.

66
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:26,631
Sorry, Mr. Wick.

67
00:11:27,424 --> 00:11:28,716
I know. Rules.

68
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:30,467
Rules.

69
00:11:36,806 --> 00:11:40,727
John Wick, 14 million.
Open contract is now in effect.

70
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,229
All services are suspended.

71
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,845
And away we go.

72
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:44,832
Top shelf. On the right. Yeah. Take four.

73
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,835
It will give you energy.
Help with the pain.

74
00:12:57,887 --> 00:12:59,097
Mr. Wick?

75
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:03,101
They'll never believe
I stopped on the hour.

76
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:04,685
But you did.

77
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:06,270
They'll know.

78
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:07,645
Know what?

79
00:13:07,728 --> 00:13:09,355
I told you where the medicine was.

80
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:27,581
Where?

81
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:30,501
Here. Just below my floating rib.
Be sure not to hit my--

82
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:35,130
Oh, wait!

83
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,382
One may not be enough.

84
00:13:41,469 --> 00:13:43,429
Yeah. All right.

85
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,931
Be sure not to graze my--

86
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:56,942
Good luck, Mr. Wick.

87
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:01,322
Thanks, Doc.

88
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:44,321
John Wick. Open contract.
Increase, 15 million.

89
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,115
Where are you going, Jonathan?

90
00:23:58,541 --> 00:23:59,917
We are closed.

91
00:24:36,286 --> 00:24:37,412
Better get going.

92
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:48,507
Sofia.

93
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:31,044
Okay.

94
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,092
You made your point.

95
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:41,762
You have earned my fealty.

96
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:45,974
Matter of fact,
I'm gonna shove so much fealty up your ass

97
00:27:46,057 --> 00:27:47,767
it's gonna come
spilling out of your mouth.

98
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:49,686
You had your chance.

99
00:27:50,186 --> 00:27:52,188
Well, since you see it that way,

100
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:55,315
I guess it's time I told you

101
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:59,194
to climb down off your High Table
and go fuck yourself.

102
00:27:59,653 --> 00:28:00,696
Duly noted.

103
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:06,785
You gave John Wick seven bullets,
your penance will be paid with seven cuts.

104
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:09,454
Well, sometimes you gotta
cut a motherfucker.

105
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,835
Avert your eyes, my sweet.

106
00:28:16,503 --> 00:28:19,381
The king is dead.

107
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,221
Long live the king.

108
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:21,235
Drink.

109
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,862
Don't worry, your weapon is still there.

110
00:29:26,113 --> 00:29:27,114
Please drink.

111
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,836
My son, how have you come to be so lost?

112
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:42,922
Not lost.

113
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,674
Looking for you.

114
00:29:45,757 --> 00:29:47,549
You think I speak of your location?

115
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,597
Never seen a man fight so hard
to end up back where he started.

116
00:30:01,522 --> 00:30:02,648
So tell me, Jonathan.

117
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:02,731
So tell me, Jonathan.

118
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:03,148
So tell me, Jonathan.

119
00:30:03,732 --> 00:30:04,858
Why do you wish to live?

120
00:30:06,193 --> 00:30:09,113
My wife, Helen.

121
00:30:11,949 --> 00:30:13,075
To remember her.

122
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,412
To remember us.

123
00:30:16,996 --> 00:30:19,581
So you seek to live
for the memory of love?

124
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,502
At least a chance to earn it.

125
00:30:25,254 --> 00:30:28,299
I can give you one last chance
to earn a life.

126
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:31,551
However, it might not be
the life that you wish.

127
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:36,973
Complete a task for us,
and your Excommunicado will be reversed.

128
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,933
The open contract closed,

129
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,519
you would be permitted
to continue to live.

130
00:30:41,602 --> 00:30:44,647
Not free under The Table, but bound to it.

131
00:30:44,731 --> 00:30:47,692
Doing what you do best
for the rest of your days.

132
00:30:52,196 --> 00:30:53,656
The choice is yours.

133
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:57,117
Die here and now

134
00:30:58,076 --> 00:31:00,495
or continue to live
and remember through death.

135
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:20,515
What must be done?

136
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,893
The cost of your life
will be the death of others.

137
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:26,146
The first of which will be
the man they call Winston.

138
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:28,523
What?

139
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:30,317
He has forgotten his fealty.

140
00:31:31,276 --> 00:31:34,905
Neither the open contract
nor the Excommunicado will be lifted

141
00:31:34,988 --> 00:31:36,364
until you complete your task.

142
00:31:37,323 --> 00:31:40,659
So if you wish to live,
and if you wish to remember,

143
00:31:41,994 --> 00:31:43,913
this is the choice you must make.

144
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:02,181
I will serve.

145
00:32:04,766 --> 00:32:06,935
I will be of service.

146
00:32:07,894 --> 00:32:09,270
Very well, my son.

147
00:32:09,938 --> 00:32:14,192
Cast aside your weakness
and reaffirm your fealty to The Table.

148
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,200
Mr. John Wick.

149
00:33:10,206 --> 00:33:11,458
Thank you.

150
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:16,254
I accept this offering and your fealty.

151
00:33:34,063 --> 00:33:35,982
I wish you good luck on your path.

152
00:33:37,025 --> 00:33:39,610
Zahir will help you prepare
for your departure.

153
00:33:41,528 --> 00:33:42,529
And, Mr. Wick...

154
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:25,614
JFK Express now arriving on platform nine.

155
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:28,492
JFK Express now arriving on platform nine.

156
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,951
Stick together, kids.

157
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:56,913
Make sure you're holding the hand
of the person in front and behind you.

158
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:03,003
You see?
That's why you're special, John Wick.

159
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,050
I wouldn't have stopped.

160
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,134
It's good to have you back.

161
00:36:18,058 --> 00:36:19,225
How was your trip?

162
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,064
Going to the Continental?

163
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:31,655
He with you?

164
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:34,657
He was.

165
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:46,377
Nice trick.

166
00:39:54,106 --> 00:39:56,942
Sir! Put your weapon down.

167
00:39:58,234 --> 00:39:59,861
He's Excommunicado.

168
00:40:01,028 --> 00:40:07,535
Unless you wish to become the same,
I suggest you lower your gun.

169
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:15,668
I'd like to see the manager.

170
00:40:18,212 --> 00:40:19,213
Of course.

171
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:22,633
If you would be so kind as to follow me.

172
00:40:36,022 --> 00:40:39,483
Please take a seat.
I will let him know you have arrived.

173
00:41:14,644 --> 00:41:16,144
I gotta tell you,

174
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:19,356
I've been looking forward
to meeting you for a long time.

175
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:22,816
I'm a huge fan, John Wick.

176
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,654
And so far, you haven't disappointed.

177
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:34,161
Is that the dog? He likes you.

178
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:39,583
Me? I'm more of a cat person myself.

179
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:41,543
Hey, dog.

180
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:49,218
We're the same, you know.
Both given the same gift.

181
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:50,761
We're not the same.

182
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:52,887
Yes, we are.

183
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:54,889
No, we're not.

184
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:00,645
The manager is ready for you now.
In the administrative lounge, sir.

185
00:42:15,326 --> 00:42:16,786
Mr. Wick.

186
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:19,998
Sit.

187
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:22,750
Stay.

188
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:25,252
Good dog.

189
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:34,428
No.

190
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:41,351
After this, we are less than even.

191
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,481
We leave in 10 minutes.

192
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:11,981
How can I help you?

193
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,704
I wasn't expecting The High Table so soon.

194
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:30,624
There is a task.

195
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:34,586
It involves someone who broke the rules
and stood against The Table.

196
00:44:36,546 --> 00:44:37,797
John Wick, you mean.

197
00:44:38,881 --> 00:44:40,341
My students have not been idle.

198
00:44:40,842 --> 00:44:43,136
John Wick and all who've helped him.

199
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,139
You've heard the stories
about him, of course.

200
00:44:46,222 --> 00:44:48,807
Killed scores of men
this past week alone because of--

201
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:51,267
A dog, a car.

202
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:53,519
I'm familiar.

203
00:44:56,814 --> 00:44:57,857
And I'm interested.

204
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,859
Very.

205
00:45:07,657 --> 00:45:10,368
Blowfish. Very fatal.

206
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:16,457
No soy.

207
00:45:25,175 --> 00:45:28,595
I have served, I will be of service.

208
00:47:09,821 --> 00:47:10,905
Stop!

209
00:47:18,121 --> 00:47:19,122
Out!

210
00:47:25,837 --> 00:47:28,798
The High Table and the Ruska Roma
have an understanding.

211
00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:32,302
Yes, and you helped John Wick.

212
00:47:32,385 --> 00:47:33,469
He had a ticket.

213
00:47:33,553 --> 00:47:35,805
But a ticket does not stand
above The Table.

214
00:47:35,888 --> 00:47:38,725
Your penance will be paid in blood.

215
00:47:39,892 --> 00:47:40,893
Now...

216
00:47:43,521 --> 00:47:47,775
hold out your helping hands
and pledge your fealty.

217
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:01,331
I have served, I will be of service.

218
00:48:24,395 --> 00:48:26,189
We're not going in like the old days.

219
00:48:27,231 --> 00:48:28,733
It's just a conversation.

220
00:48:30,233 --> 00:48:33,612
Nothing's ever just a conversation
with you, John.

221
00:48:37,783 --> 00:48:38,784
Let's go.

222
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:04,433
Sofia.

223
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,977
Always so nice to see you.

224
00:49:07,728 --> 00:49:11,399
And the dogs, of course, how marvelous.
May I pet one?

225
00:49:12,274 --> 00:49:13,275
Certainly.

226
00:49:17,696 --> 00:49:19,323
Fantastic.

227
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:21,534
Jonathan Wick.

228
00:49:22,952 --> 00:49:26,080
I had heard
you had made your way to our shores.

229
00:49:31,877 --> 00:49:32,961
Come along now.

230
00:49:33,545 --> 00:49:35,421
I am certain we have much to discuss.

231
00:49:40,217 --> 00:49:44,638
I must admit, I am curious.
What brings you to my domain?

232
00:49:46,514 --> 00:49:48,766
Tell me, do you come here to kill me?

233
00:49:51,686 --> 00:49:52,687
No.

234
00:50:01,988 --> 00:50:06,200
Mr. Wick, do you know
where the word "assassin" comes from?

235
00:50:08,035 --> 00:50:11,080
People argue. "Assassin."

236
00:50:12,832 --> 00:50:16,169
Hashasheen, followers of Hassan-i...

237
00:50:17,795 --> 00:50:19,255
Eaters of hashish.

238
00:50:21,966 --> 00:50:23,342
No, thank you.

239
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:28,346
But others contend
it comes from asasiyyun.

240
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:32,601
Meaning, "men who are faithful
and who abide by their beliefs."

241
00:50:34,477 --> 00:50:35,728
You see that coin?

242
00:50:36,936 --> 00:50:39,814
The first coin ever minted
in this facility.

243
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:43,610
Next to it, the first marker.

244
00:50:44,027 --> 00:50:46,029
Not easy to track down, believe me.

245
00:50:46,696 --> 00:50:50,657
Now, this coin, of course,
it does not represent monetary value.

246
00:50:51,241 --> 00:50:54,410
It represents
the commerce of relationships,

247
00:50:54,494 --> 00:50:57,914
a social contract
in which you agree to partake.

248
00:50:58,956 --> 00:51:00,248
Order and rules.

249
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:06,296
You have broken the rules.
The High Table has marked you for death.

250
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:08,798
Why would I allow you to leave here alive,

251
00:51:08,882 --> 00:51:12,677
when your life has been,
by your own actions, forfeit?

252
00:51:18,016 --> 00:51:19,684
I seek to make amends.

253
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:22,479
To pay for what I've done.

254
00:51:23,104 --> 00:51:26,608
I seek a meeting
with the one who sits above The Table.

255
00:51:31,238 --> 00:51:34,407
This dog, I do so love it.

256
00:51:35,116 --> 00:51:37,869
Tell me, does it shed a great deal?

257
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,082
Occasionally.

258
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:45,293
When I leave,
you can tell The Elder I'm coming,

259
00:51:46,211 --> 00:51:47,254
and if he wants me dead--

260
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:50,714
Then he will see to it
that your bones bleach under the sun.

261
00:51:52,132 --> 00:51:53,175
I see.

262
00:51:53,884 --> 00:51:55,970
And I would have provided him
with a choice.

263
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:05,271
I am sorry, Mr. Wick.

264
00:52:06,313 --> 00:52:08,524
I cannot tell you where to find The Elder.

265
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:12,945
You fail to understand.

266
00:52:13,404 --> 00:52:17,283
The Elder is not a man you find.
He can only choose to find you.

267
00:52:17,866 --> 00:52:18,909
You wish to speak with him?

268
00:52:20,035 --> 00:52:22,371
Go to the edge of the desert, look up.

269
00:52:23,372 --> 00:52:24,790
Canis Minor,

270
00:52:24,873 --> 00:52:27,918
the dog that followed Orion
through the sky.

271
00:52:28,377 --> 00:52:32,506
You follow the brightest star,
walk until you are almost dead,

272
00:52:33,007 --> 00:52:35,009
then, keep walking.

273
00:52:35,634 --> 00:52:38,679
When you are on your last breath,
he will find you...

274
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:41,849
or he will not.

275
00:52:43,601 --> 00:52:45,019
I am grateful.

276
00:52:47,812 --> 00:52:49,022
Thank you, sir.

277
00:52:51,733 --> 00:52:53,735
Perhaps you were not listening before.

278
00:52:57,947 --> 00:52:59,531
The social contract.

279
00:53:00,991 --> 00:53:02,867
The commerce of relationships.

280
00:53:04,075 --> 00:53:07,244
You have received a great gift.
I have hosted your friend.

281
00:53:08,704 --> 00:53:10,706
What do you offer in return?

282
00:53:14,877 --> 00:53:17,713
So soft and yet so fierce.

283
00:53:18,505 --> 00:53:20,424
I love it, this dog.

284
00:53:22,051 --> 00:53:23,385
I will keep it.

285
00:53:23,469 --> 00:53:24,637
Excuse me?

286
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,932
This will be my gift.
This will be how you show me your fealty.

287
00:53:29,016 --> 00:53:30,224
No.

288
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,476
Surely it's the least you can do.

289
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,519
No, you cannot keep my dog.

290
00:53:35,729 --> 00:53:36,730
Very well.

291
00:53:38,398 --> 00:53:39,399
Very well.

292
00:53:41,902 --> 00:53:43,445
Then I will kill it.

293
00:53:48,742 --> 00:53:52,746
I'm sorry, Sofia.
This was for you to learn.

294
00:54:01,421 --> 00:54:02,422
Don't.

295
00:54:44,256 --> 00:54:46,258
Sofia, don't.

296
00:54:51,471 --> 00:54:52,889
He shot my dog.

297
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:55,891
I get it.

298
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,271
We gotta go. Now.

299
01:01:18,899 --> 01:01:19,983
Jardani.

300
01:01:21,527 --> 01:01:23,237
Why have you come home?

301
01:01:28,659 --> 01:01:30,661
You present this to me like an answer.

302
01:01:31,453 --> 01:01:33,247
I still have my ticket.

303
01:01:35,082 --> 01:01:38,043
After all the chaos you've caused
for the last few weeks,

304
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,170
you think your ticket is valid?

305
01:01:40,629 --> 01:01:44,550
You forget that the Ruska Roma
is bound by The High Table,

306
01:01:44,633 --> 01:01:46,927
and The High Table stands above all?

307
01:01:47,928 --> 01:01:50,055
They could kill me
just for talking to you.

308
01:01:51,639 --> 01:01:56,435
You honor me
by bringing death to my front door.

309
01:01:58,563 --> 01:02:02,733
Oh, Jardani, what has become of you?

310
01:02:21,043 --> 01:02:22,795
You are bound...

311
01:02:22,879 --> 01:02:25,006
and I am owed.

312
01:02:30,011 --> 01:02:31,179
Rooney, enough!

313
01:03:03,169 --> 01:03:05,838
"You are owed."
You are owed nothing, Jardani.

314
01:03:05,922 --> 01:03:10,051
You know, when my pupils first come here,
they wish for one thing.

315
01:03:10,134 --> 01:03:11,552
A life free of suffering.

316
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:15,263
I try to dissuade them
from these childish notions,

317
01:03:15,347 --> 01:03:17,390
but as you know,

318
01:03:18,183 --> 01:03:19,309
art is pain.

319
01:03:23,146 --> 01:03:24,522
Life is suffering.

320
01:03:30,195 --> 01:03:32,030
Somehow, you managed to get out.

321
01:03:33,657 --> 01:03:35,659
But here you are, back where you began.

322
01:03:36,993 --> 01:03:38,285
All of this, for what?

323
01:04:15,906 --> 01:04:16,949
Pirouette.

324
01:04:18,867 --> 01:04:20,911
Pirouette, pirouette.

325
01:04:24,164 --> 01:04:25,207
Sit.

326
01:04:38,971 --> 01:04:43,726
Even if I wanted to,
I can't help you, Jardani.

327
01:04:44,768 --> 01:04:46,979
The High Table wants your life.

328
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:49,481
How can you fight the wind?

329
01:04:50,607 --> 01:04:54,028
How can you smash the mountains?
How can you bury the ocean?

330
01:04:54,862 --> 01:04:57,489
How can you escape from the light?

331
01:04:57,573 --> 01:05:02,119
Of course, you can go to the dark.
But they're in the dark, too.

332
01:05:04,747 --> 01:05:09,793
So tell me, Jardani,
what do you really want?

333
01:05:12,546 --> 01:05:13,547
Passage.

334
01:05:15,174 --> 01:05:16,508
Where did you want to go?

335
01:05:18,344 --> 01:05:19,636
Casablanca.

336
01:05:22,139 --> 01:05:25,142
The path to paradise begins in hell.

337
01:05:30,521 --> 01:05:31,647
So be it.

338
01:05:32,148 --> 01:05:35,610
You hand me your ticket, I will tear it.

339
01:05:37,028 --> 01:05:39,280
If that's what you really desire.

340
01:06:18,653 --> 01:06:22,115
With this, Jardani, your ticket is torn.

341
01:06:31,749 --> 01:06:33,918
You can never come home again.

342
01:06:36,003 --> 01:06:37,463
Take him to the lifeboat.

343
01:06:39,382 --> 01:06:40,466
Do svidanya.

344
01:06:43,302 --> 01:06:45,096
Do svidanya.

345
01:07:16,169 --> 01:07:19,255
Welcome to the Continental.
How may I help you?

346
01:07:37,648 --> 01:07:42,236
Sir. There is an Adjudicator
here to see you.

347
01:07:43,946 --> 01:07:45,030
Very well, sir.

348
01:07:48,241 --> 01:07:50,285
The manager is in the lounge.

349
01:07:55,207 --> 01:07:58,126
I presume you're here
to discuss John Wick.

350
01:07:59,294 --> 01:08:01,379
If that's so, we can make this short.

351
01:08:01,922 --> 01:08:05,175
I told him to walk away,
he declined to do so.

352
01:08:05,258 --> 01:08:06,634
And that's the all of it.

353
01:08:07,676 --> 01:08:09,011
Mr. Wick broke the rules.

354
01:08:09,094 --> 01:08:10,221
Oh, yes.

355
01:08:11,429 --> 01:08:13,348
And I haven't got the slightest idea
where he is--

356
01:08:13,431 --> 01:08:16,559
You're mistaken.
I'm not here for Mr. Wick.

357
01:08:16,643 --> 01:08:19,020
I'm here because
Mr. Wick broke the rules in this hotel.

358
01:08:19,812 --> 01:08:22,773
The blood was spilt on the grounds
of the Continental, was it not?

359
01:08:22,856 --> 01:08:23,982
Oh, yes.

360
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:28,237
As a matter of fact, the body gets colder
within these very walls.

361
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:30,155
I'd like to see it.

362
01:08:58,433 --> 01:09:00,435
Santino D'Antonio.

363
01:09:01,353 --> 01:09:03,480
A newly instated member of The High Table,

364
01:09:03,564 --> 01:09:07,484
slain by Mr. Wick while seeking sanctuary
in the Continental.

365
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,365
With a .45 ACP, it appears.

366
01:09:15,533 --> 01:09:18,452
I had no control over Mr. Wick's actions.

367
01:09:18,536 --> 01:09:21,080
And yet, he lives
because you deemed it so, yes?

368
01:09:22,164 --> 01:09:23,332
Yes.

369
01:09:23,416 --> 01:09:25,418
You have known Mr. Wick
for a great many years.

370
01:09:25,501 --> 01:09:27,545
It might even be fair
to call you friends, yes?

371
01:09:28,796 --> 01:09:31,132
Instead of stopping him,
instead of killing him,

372
01:09:31,215 --> 01:09:33,050
you stood by and let him walk away

373
01:09:33,134 --> 01:09:35,595
after he shot Santino D'Antonio
in front of you.

374
01:09:35,678 --> 01:09:37,638
I made him Excommunicado.

375
01:09:37,722 --> 01:09:40,558
But not before
you gave him an hour to escape.

376
01:09:40,641 --> 01:09:42,184
He broke the rules in my hotel.

377
01:09:42,268 --> 01:09:46,272
This is exactly the problem: your hotel.
Where is your fealty?

378
01:09:47,315 --> 01:09:49,442
I've been of service for over 40 years.

379
01:09:49,525 --> 01:09:53,278
Under The Table. Serving The Table.
Everything is under The Table.

380
01:09:53,361 --> 01:09:56,406
I understand that you have your loyalties,
but this cannot be overlooked.

381
01:09:56,489 --> 01:09:59,743
Let me be clear. I am here to adjudge you.

382
01:10:00,201 --> 01:10:01,703
You have one week
to get your affairs in order.

383
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:04,579
Excuse me?

384
01:10:04,662 --> 01:10:07,415
At such time,
your successor will be named.

385
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:10,751
There are rules,

386
01:10:10,834 --> 01:10:12,544
they are the only things
that separate us--

387
01:10:12,628 --> 01:10:13,712
From the animals.

388
01:10:13,795 --> 01:10:16,256
Yes. You have seven days.

389
01:10:20,636 --> 01:10:23,639
In the meantime, if you need
any assistance with your transition,

390
01:10:23,722 --> 01:10:25,766
you may look for me in room 217.

391
01:10:26,642 --> 01:10:29,478
Enjoy your stay at the Continental.

392
01:10:42,741 --> 01:10:44,785
There's an Adjudicator here to see you.

393
01:10:59,174 --> 01:11:02,010
Welcome to my Mission Control.

394
01:11:02,594 --> 01:11:05,931
Brain stem of my operation.
The information super flyway.

395
01:11:06,014 --> 01:11:08,100
From whence I control
the word on the street,

396
01:11:08,183 --> 01:11:09,351
the way of the world.

397
01:11:09,768 --> 01:11:11,103
With pigeons.

398
01:11:11,186 --> 01:11:14,731
Yes. You see rats with wings,
but I see the Internet.

399
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:19,694
No IP addresses. No digital footprint.

400
01:11:20,277 --> 01:11:23,822
Can't track it, can't hack it,
can't trace it.

401
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,615
Can you get disease from it?

402
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:28,493
Well, I wouldn't recommend
that you eat one.

403
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:31,246
What the hell do you want?

404
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:34,207
I wanted to see where it didn't happen.

405
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,958
Where what didn't happen?

406
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,709
Where you didn't kill John Wick.

407
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,253
I've always been under the impression

408
01:11:40,336 --> 01:11:43,047
that contracts
and executing them was optional.

409
01:11:43,131 --> 01:11:44,923
I have no problem with John Wick.

410
01:11:51,388 --> 01:11:54,891
And yet, you gave John
a seven-round Kimber 1911,

411
01:11:54,975 --> 01:11:58,270
knowing that he intended to use it
to stand against The Table. Yes?

412
01:12:02,858 --> 01:12:05,360
This Kimber 1911, to be exact.

413
01:12:13,118 --> 01:12:16,871
You gave John Wick seven bullets,
The High Table is giving you seven days.

414
01:12:17,747 --> 01:12:19,790
Seven days for what, exactly?

415
01:12:19,874 --> 01:12:23,127
To settle your affairs
and find a new home for your birds.

416
01:12:23,794 --> 01:12:26,046
In seven days, you abdicate your throne.

417
01:12:38,559 --> 01:12:39,851
Oh, my dear.

418
01:12:39,934 --> 01:12:42,604
Tell me, do you know
what the Bowery is, Adjudicator?

419
01:12:42,687 --> 01:12:44,522
Do you know what happens
when I wave my hand?

420
01:12:45,273 --> 01:12:48,568
No, there will be no replacement for me
on the throne.

421
01:12:48,651 --> 01:12:51,112
Because I am the throne, baby.

422
01:12:51,196 --> 01:12:53,072
I am the Bowery!

423
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:58,410
I am all that you deign not to look at
when you walk down the street at night.

424
01:12:58,494 --> 01:13:02,122
The Bowery is mine. Mine alone.

425
01:13:03,373 --> 01:13:07,836
Do not make the mistake of thinking
you exist outside the rules, no men do.

426
01:13:08,587 --> 01:13:10,214
You have seven days.

427
01:14:50,439 --> 01:14:51,607
Enough!

428
01:14:57,404 --> 01:15:00,115
I'm afraid our friend here is off limits.

429
01:15:00,198 --> 01:15:02,659
But he's Excommunicado.

430
01:15:03,327 --> 01:15:05,787
It seems the manager
has granted him amnesty.

431
01:15:07,414 --> 01:15:11,293
Mr. Jonathan,
would you be so kind as to come with me?

432
01:15:31,813 --> 01:15:34,024
Welcome to Casablanca, Mr. Wick.

433
01:15:35,025 --> 01:15:36,026
Thanks.

434
01:15:41,782 --> 01:15:44,117
Mr. Jonathan, it has been a long time

435
01:15:44,201 --> 01:15:46,703
since our fine city
has been graced with your presence.

436
01:15:47,329 --> 01:15:48,537
I need to talk to--

437
01:15:48,621 --> 01:15:50,581
Yes, Ms. Al-Azwar, she's expecting you.

438
01:15:58,088 --> 01:16:01,591
My, my,
welcome to the Moroccan Continental.

439
01:16:01,675 --> 01:16:03,426
I hope you'll find it to your taste.

440
01:16:05,386 --> 01:16:06,553
Right this way.

441
01:16:06,637 --> 01:16:09,056
Ms. Al-Azwar, she waits for no man.

442
01:16:13,686 --> 01:16:18,107
Best of luck, Mr. Jonathan. Best of luck.

443
01:16:53,183 --> 01:16:55,059
You a dog person, John?

444
01:16:56,143 --> 01:16:57,144
Soﬁa?

445
01:17:02,899 --> 01:17:06,111
Sofia, you can't kill
the bearer of your marker.

446
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:09,448
I didn't kill you. I just shot you.

447
01:17:10,782 --> 01:17:11,950
Nice suit.

448
01:17:14,745 --> 01:17:16,329
Good to see you, too.

449
01:17:16,413 --> 01:17:18,582
I should shoot you in the head right now.

450
01:17:18,665 --> 01:17:19,749
I know.

451
01:17:25,379 --> 01:17:27,006
Don't you do it.

452
01:17:28,716 --> 01:17:30,468
You're Excommunicado, John.

453
01:17:31,343 --> 01:17:35,806
And that marker doesn't mean shit.

454
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:42,938
This is your blood.

455
01:17:44,148 --> 01:17:45,316
Your bond.

456
01:17:46,275 --> 01:17:50,863
When you needed help, I was there.

457
01:17:58,829 --> 01:17:59,830
Sit.

458
01:18:03,959 --> 01:18:05,795
I was talking to you, John.

459
01:18:10,925 --> 01:18:14,136
You do realize
that I'm management now, right?

460
01:18:15,596 --> 01:18:17,515
I'm not service anymore, John.

461
01:18:17,598 --> 01:18:20,559
So I don't go around
shooting people in the head.

462
01:18:21,227 --> 01:18:25,606
I'm not asking you to kill anyone.
I just need you to get me to him.

463
01:18:26,232 --> 01:18:28,776
-To who?
-Your old boss.

464
01:18:30,861 --> 01:18:32,196
You want to kill Berrada.

465
01:18:32,279 --> 01:18:34,323
I'm not gonna kill him.
I just need to talk.

466
01:18:34,406 --> 01:18:36,909
What could he possibly give to you?

467
01:18:39,537 --> 01:18:40,871
Guidance.

468
01:18:40,955 --> 01:18:45,751
Look, I made a deal
when I agreed to run this hotel.

469
01:18:45,835 --> 01:18:49,296
And that deal said that I had to follow
the rules of The Table.

470
01:18:50,131 --> 01:18:53,217
If you're not gonna kill him,
he is gonna kill you,

471
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:56,178
and then probably me, too,
for walking you up in there.

472
01:18:57,221 --> 01:19:00,724
If I make one mistake, one enemy...

473
01:19:02,059 --> 01:19:05,688
maybe somebody goes
looking for my daughter.

474
01:19:07,106 --> 01:19:09,942
And I know what you did, John,
to get her out.

475
01:19:11,318 --> 01:19:15,447
But that's not a chance I can take. Sorry.

476
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:19,785
Do you wanna know where she is?

477
01:19:20,786 --> 01:19:23,455
No. I don't ever wanna know.

478
01:19:24,081 --> 01:19:26,917
Because I don't trust
that I won't go find her.

479
01:19:28,209 --> 01:19:30,879
A part of me longs for her.

480
01:19:32,213 --> 01:19:36,301
And I have to kill that part
of myself every day,

481
01:19:36,384 --> 01:19:38,011
just to keep her safe.

482
01:19:41,264 --> 01:19:47,562
Because sometimes,
you have to kill what you love.

483
01:19:48,271 --> 01:19:51,064
That's why I gave you that marker
in the first place.

484
01:19:51,148 --> 01:19:54,943
That's why I'm sitting here right now
and that's why I'm fucked!

485
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:11,376
Consequences.

486
01:20:15,505 --> 01:20:16,840
Consequences.

487
01:21:09,434 --> 01:21:10,518
Here you go.

488
01:21:15,439 --> 01:21:17,358
You're gonna die, John.

489
01:21:18,192 --> 01:21:20,319
Whether out here in this desert,

490
01:21:21,403 --> 01:21:23,363
or somewhere else down the road.

491
01:21:25,615 --> 01:21:27,033
But you are gonna die.

492
01:23:06,591 --> 01:23:07,759
Consequences.

493
01:23:07,842 --> 01:23:08,843
Yeah.

494
01:23:10,762 --> 01:23:12,638
Consequences.

495
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:16,767
I'm just asking you to try.

496
01:23:17,893 --> 01:23:21,188
Either way, you and me, we'll be even.

497
01:23:33,826 --> 01:23:35,994
Tread carefully, Jonathan.

498
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:48,090
We only use this room
on special occasions.

499
01:23:48,173 --> 01:23:52,177
When you simply have to see
what your opponent is holding

500
01:23:52,261 --> 01:23:53,637
under the table.

501
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:57,808
How was your journey here? Eventful?

502
01:23:59,059 --> 01:24:00,185
Yeah.

503
01:24:00,269 --> 01:24:01,270
Well, of course.

504
01:24:02,562 --> 01:24:06,691
They sent men to kill you,
and now you to kill me.

505
01:24:08,067 --> 01:24:09,694
Isn't that why you're here?

506
01:24:10,069 --> 01:24:14,449
I have served, I will be of service.

507
01:24:16,658 --> 01:24:17,950
But you're having doubts.

508
01:24:19,785 --> 01:24:22,455
Just don't make the mistake of pretending
this is personal.

509
01:24:23,414 --> 01:24:25,332
If you feel you must...

510
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:30,045
put a bullet through my heart.

511
01:24:36,844 --> 01:24:39,180
The High Table has asked me to step down.

512
01:24:39,638 --> 01:24:40,681
The hour?

513
01:24:41,474 --> 01:24:42,725
The hour.

514
01:24:42,808 --> 01:24:45,060
You should have killed me
in the Continental.

515
01:24:46,228 --> 01:24:47,520
Maybe I should have.

516
01:24:48,646 --> 01:24:50,815
Rules and consequences.

517
01:24:52,817 --> 01:24:56,279
It seems like everyone is suffering
from the consequences of their actions.

518
01:24:56,863 --> 01:24:58,655
And you're not stepping down?

519
01:25:01,074 --> 01:25:02,117
No.

520
01:25:03,452 --> 01:25:04,578
I don't think I am.

521
01:25:05,412 --> 01:25:06,872
So it's war?

522
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:09,458
You're going to war with The High Table?

523
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:11,084
Skirmish.

524
01:25:11,627 --> 01:25:13,086
Unless you decide to shoot me.

525
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:16,547
But then, I'd rather die
at the hand of a friend

526
01:25:17,215 --> 01:25:18,466
than that of an enemy.

527
01:25:19,966 --> 01:25:22,551
No, I've made my choice.
It's up to you to make yours.

528
01:25:24,386 --> 01:25:25,678
What choice?

529
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:29,307
You shoot me, you sell your soul.

530
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:32,977
But I'll be alive. And I can remember her.

531
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:36,397
Until you die as a servant
of The High Table.

532
01:25:36,481 --> 01:25:40,485
Now, you did the impossible,
you stopped, you got out.

533
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:44,447
You only came back
because Helen was taken away from you.

534
01:25:44,531 --> 01:25:48,243
The real question is,
who do you wish to die as?

535
01:25:49,118 --> 01:25:50,202
The Baba Yaga?

536
01:25:50,786 --> 01:25:52,788
The last thing many men ever see?

537
01:25:52,871 --> 01:25:57,376
Or as a man who loved
and was loved by his wife?

538
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,462
Who do you wish to die as, Jonathan?

539
01:26:32,703 --> 01:26:37,332
Mr. Wick, it's a pleasure to meet you.
I am an Adjudicator.

540
01:26:38,916 --> 01:26:40,543
Have you decided to step down?

541
01:26:43,296 --> 01:26:44,547
I think not.

542
01:26:46,173 --> 01:26:49,134
And you? Will you be putting
a bullet in his head?

543
01:26:52,637 --> 01:26:55,432
No, I don't think I will.

544
01:27:03,523 --> 01:27:04,691
Very well.

545
01:27:13,116 --> 01:27:14,743
Administration.

546
01:27:14,826 --> 01:27:16,578
I'd like to change a designation.

547
01:27:17,662 --> 01:27:18,788
Verification?

548
01:27:18,872 --> 01:27:22,000
Adjudication 1-0-1-1-9-7-9.

549
01:27:22,083 --> 01:27:24,169
The Continental Hotel, New York.

550
01:27:24,252 --> 01:27:25,628
New designation?

551
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:27,462
Deconsecrated.

552
01:27:30,298 --> 01:27:31,299
Processing.

553
01:27:33,884 --> 01:27:34,926
Administrator.

554
01:27:36,345 --> 01:27:39,930
File. The New York Continental Hotel.

555
01:27:51,108 --> 01:27:55,237
The New York Continental Hotel
has been deconsecrated. Goodbye.

556
01:28:02,828 --> 01:28:05,289
Gentlemen, this institution
is now deconsecrated.

557
01:28:05,373 --> 01:28:08,125
Business may now be conducted
on Continental grounds.

558
01:28:08,209 --> 01:28:12,421
Since you are refusing to step down
and you are refusing a direct order,

559
01:28:12,505 --> 01:28:14,340
your lives are now forfeit.

560
01:28:14,757 --> 01:28:16,966
High Table emissaries
will be joining you presently

561
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:19,552
to see the removal
of your souls from the property.

562
01:28:21,054 --> 01:28:22,889
Good evening, gentlemen.

563
01:28:27,227 --> 01:28:30,355
This haven is safe no more.

564
01:28:33,108 --> 01:28:35,693
Are services still off limits to me?

565
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:39,987
Under the circumstances, your privileges
are reinstated immediately.

566
01:28:40,071 --> 01:28:40,279
What do you need?

567
01:28:40,279 --> 01:28:40,363
What do you need?

568
01:28:40,363 --> 01:28:41,322
What do you need?

569
01:28:42,073 --> 01:28:45,118
Guns. Lots of guns.

570
01:29:03,511 --> 01:29:05,471
Let's make a withdrawal.

571
01:29:29,704 --> 01:29:33,583
Remember, sir,
these will be High Table forces.

572
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:36,085
We may have to consider
our choices carefully.

573
01:29:36,753 --> 01:29:38,004
Why?

574
01:29:38,087 --> 01:29:39,714
Much has changed during your time away.

575
01:29:40,423 --> 01:29:41,799
Like what?

576
01:29:41,883 --> 01:29:44,552
Well, let us say
they have made armor improvements.

577
01:29:52,518 --> 01:29:56,355
May I suggest the 2011 Combat Master

578
01:29:56,439 --> 01:29:58,691
in combination with
the nine millimeter major.

579
01:30:10,286 --> 01:30:12,038
Attention, all guests.

580
01:30:12,121 --> 01:30:14,582
The Continental Hotel
is closing for fumigation.

581
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:19,212
We apologize for the inconvenience.
Please make your way to the nearest exit.

582
01:30:24,133 --> 01:30:26,844
Attention, all guests.
The Continental Hotel...

583
01:30:26,928 --> 01:30:30,473
It seems circumstances
have changed in your favor.

584
01:30:30,556 --> 01:30:33,725
Your transaction may now be conducted
on Continental grounds.

585
01:30:39,564 --> 01:30:42,733
We'll be sending some of our finest
for additional support.

586
01:30:42,817 --> 01:30:45,736
Cool. Very cool.

587
01:30:50,699 --> 01:30:56,914
One twenty-five grain,
1,425 feet per second. Serious business.

588
01:31:00,626 --> 01:31:01,627
Thank you.

589
01:31:02,211 --> 01:31:03,879
Let us begin.

590
01:32:50,152 --> 01:32:52,988
Charon, would you help set
the mood for our new guests?

591
01:32:53,864 --> 01:32:55,074
Of course, sir.

592
01:33:16,929 --> 01:33:19,514
I know you'll do the Continental proud.

593
01:33:19,597 --> 01:33:21,140
I'll see you soon, sir.

594
01:33:24,268 --> 01:33:27,355
And you, Jonathan, do what you do best.

595
01:33:27,939 --> 01:33:28,940
What's that?

596
01:33:29,857 --> 01:33:31,067
Hunt

597
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:07,909
Winston! Winston!

598
01:37:12,371 --> 01:37:13,915
I need more firepower.

599
01:37:37,271 --> 01:37:38,814
Armor improvements.

600
01:37:39,398 --> 01:37:42,235
Twelve-gauge steel slugs. Armor-piercing.

601
01:41:09,692 --> 01:41:11,610
Only by my sword, John.

602
01:41:24,206 --> 01:41:26,208
I know you believe you can keep this up.

603
01:41:26,292 --> 01:41:27,500
But I assure you--

604
01:49:32,693 --> 01:49:35,363
John, you're incredible.

605
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:41,118
Exhausted, outnumbered, obviously in pain,

606
01:49:42,453 --> 01:49:44,997
and you still beat all of my students.

607
01:49:45,331 --> 01:49:49,961
If I didn't have to kill you,
we'd be... pals.

608
01:49:50,962 --> 01:49:52,046
Let's do this.

609
01:50:19,991 --> 01:50:22,118
See? We're the same.

610
01:54:09,094 --> 01:54:11,096
I would like to suggest a parley.

611
01:54:11,847 --> 01:54:13,390
A parley would be good.

612
01:54:13,474 --> 01:54:14,475
Very well.

613
01:54:26,111 --> 01:54:27,655
Are we in play, sir?

614
01:54:29,323 --> 01:54:30,658
Oh, very much so.

615
01:54:50,177 --> 01:54:51,637
Hey, John.

616
01:54:54,098 --> 01:54:56,183
That was a pretty good fight, huh?

617
01:55:00,312 --> 01:55:01,313
Yeah.

618
01:55:31,135 --> 01:55:32,219
Yeah.

619
01:55:32,970 --> 01:55:35,597
Don't worry about me, John.

620
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:38,267
I just gotta catch my breath.

621
01:55:40,602 --> 01:55:42,186
I'll catch up to you, John.

622
01:55:47,608 --> 01:55:48,735
No, you won't.

623
01:56:00,038 --> 01:56:03,374
You gentlemen, of course,
realize that was the first wave.

624
01:56:03,458 --> 01:56:05,126
Merely an amuse-bouche.

625
01:56:06,044 --> 01:56:09,421
We can keep this up as long as you'd like,
but it only ends one way.

626
01:56:09,504 --> 01:56:11,881
Are you sure a protracted war
is the best way forward?

627
01:56:11,964 --> 01:56:14,216
There won't be anything
"protracted" about it.

628
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:16,594
Oh, you can take the Continental,
I have no doubt about that,

629
01:56:16,677 --> 01:56:19,388
but keeping it,
that's a different matter entirely.

630
01:56:19,472 --> 01:56:22,350
My allegiances run
way beyond this building.

631
01:56:23,434 --> 01:56:24,852
We are High Table.

632
01:56:25,644 --> 01:56:26,896
And we...

633
01:56:28,104 --> 01:56:29,856
are New York City.

634
01:56:30,899 --> 01:56:32,399
Are we negotiating?

635
01:56:36,152 --> 01:56:37,528
I believe we are.

636
01:56:43,284 --> 01:56:44,285
Parley?

637
01:56:45,161 --> 01:56:46,537
Parley.

638
01:56:50,124 --> 01:56:52,168
What do you propose we do?

639
01:56:56,464 --> 01:56:58,256
Let me keep my power.

640
01:56:58,965 --> 01:56:59,966
Under The Table.

641
01:57:02,927 --> 01:57:07,431
I have served
and been a beacon of order and stability

642
01:57:07,515 --> 01:57:09,642
to our industry for over 40 years.

643
01:57:09,725 --> 01:57:14,605
Now, I humbly acknowledge I overstepped
and re-pledge my fealty to The High Table.

644
01:57:17,900 --> 01:57:18,984
Winston.

645
01:57:24,698 --> 01:57:28,828
You were merely showing strength
so we would let you keep the Continental.

646
01:57:32,581 --> 01:57:34,792
The High Table accepts your fealty.

647
01:57:36,752 --> 01:57:38,003
But what about him?

648
01:57:40,214 --> 01:57:43,717
What are we going to do about John Wick?

649
01:57:49,348 --> 01:57:50,724
Oh, he has to die.

650
01:57:52,308 --> 01:57:53,309
Sorry, Jonathan.

651
01:57:53,852 --> 01:57:55,478
-Winston!
-Don't see any other way.

652
01:58:07,699 --> 01:58:12,537
Very well, gentlemen.
The Continental will now be reconsecrated.

653
01:58:13,705 --> 01:58:14,913
Good day to you both.

654
01:58:19,585 --> 01:58:20,919
Well played, sir.

655
01:58:56,497 --> 01:58:58,832
How long do you estimate until we reopen?

656
01:58:59,541 --> 01:59:01,125
Oh, should be no time at all.

657
01:59:05,296 --> 01:59:06,672
Mr. Wick is gone.

658
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:08,632
A true tragedy.

659
01:59:09,049 --> 01:59:12,719
You misunderstand.
I mean that he is no longer on the street.

660
01:59:13,470 --> 01:59:14,513
That seems improbable.

661
01:59:14,596 --> 01:59:15,888
And yet, true.

662
01:59:17,598 --> 01:59:20,100
I trust you understand
the repercussions if he survives.

663
01:59:20,184 --> 01:59:22,060
Both from above and below.

664
01:59:22,852 --> 01:59:26,856
The last thing either one of us needs is
Mr. Wick paying us a visit in the night.

665
01:59:29,734 --> 01:59:31,778
For both our sakes,
I'll hope you see to it

666
01:59:31,861 --> 01:59:34,113
that this situation is taken care of, yes?

667
01:59:34,197 --> 01:59:37,784
Absolutely. How far can he get?

668
01:59:49,379 --> 01:59:50,380
Baba Yaga.

669
02:00:22,078 --> 02:00:23,830
How you doing, John?

670
02:00:24,539 --> 02:00:26,791
You look as bad as I feel.

671
02:00:29,043 --> 02:00:30,919
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

672
02:00:31,878 --> 02:00:33,754
Raise a hand if you can hear me, John.

673
02:00:36,923 --> 02:00:41,136
Oh, shit. They took a finger.
Ain't that a bitch?

674
02:00:48,727 --> 02:00:51,187
John fucking Wick.

675
02:00:51,896 --> 02:00:55,483
So, the old boy keeps his hotel
and you take the fall.

676
02:00:56,109 --> 02:00:57,110
Can't say I blame him.

677
02:00:57,193 --> 02:00:59,404
I would've done the same thing
if I was in his shoes.

678
02:01:00,530 --> 02:01:03,158
But this High Table shit...

679
02:01:06,244 --> 02:01:07,954
Seven cuts.

680
02:01:11,499 --> 02:01:13,918
Under The Table is where shit gets done.

681
02:01:16,087 --> 02:01:19,132
And they're about to find out,
if you cut a king,

682
02:01:19,215 --> 02:01:20,883
you better cut him to the quick.

683
02:01:26,096 --> 02:01:27,306
So...

684
02:01:29,850 --> 02:01:31,226
Let me ask you, John.

685
02:01:32,269 --> 02:01:33,270
How do you feel?

686
02:01:36,065 --> 02:01:40,194
'Cause I am really pissed off.

687
02:01:41,153 --> 02:01:42,737
You pissed, John?

688
02:01:44,321 --> 02:01:45,322
Are you?

689
02:01:55,248 --> 02:01:56,750
Yeah.
