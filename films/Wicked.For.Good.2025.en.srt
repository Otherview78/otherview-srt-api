1
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,377
<i>Citizens of Oz,</i>

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,514
<i>there have been 12 tide turns</i>

3
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:15,048
<i>since the Wicked Witch</i>
<i>of the West escaped</i>

4
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,751
<i>with our Grimmerie.</i>

5
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:18,653
<i>Shield your children.</i>

6
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:21,154
<i>Trust no animals.</i>

7
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,525
<i>She will be eliminated.</i>

8
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,529
<i>Until then, the Wizard's vision</i>

9
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:31,566
<i>for the Oz of tomorrow</i>
<i>marches on.</i>

10
00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:36,136
Do it! Move!

11
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:39,306
All right, load it up.

12
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,142
Come on! Let's go! Move!

13
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,778
No speaking.

14
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:45,680
The Wizard needs
the road finished.

15
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,855
Move! Move!

16
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:56,490
Come on, let's go! Move!

17
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,626
Fill up that basket!

18
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,800
Keep moving.

19
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,167
Come on.

20
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,573
Come on. Keep moving.

21
00:01:11,606 --> 00:01:14,374
Get up!

22
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,749
Come on.

23
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,628
Whoa. Settle down.

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,169
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

25
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,442
Get back!

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,650
Retreat! Guards, retreat!

27
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:58,285
It's the Witch!

28
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,218
The Witch! She's back!

29
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:56,871
Go, go!

30
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,371
Release them!

31
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,409
<i>Come with me.</i>

32
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,545
<i>What?</i>

33
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:11,913
<i>To meet the Wizard.</i>

34
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:13,080
<i>The Wizard will see you now.</i>

35
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,553
Well, I guess.

36
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,568
Thank you.

37
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:36,103
Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

38
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,672
Good.

39
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:45,713
She's so Good.

40
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:50,117
Glinda the Good.

41
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:24,417
Hup!

42
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:28,950
There's a quoncert in Quox,

43
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:30,217
if you want to attend,
next week.

44
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:31,819
Oh. Perhaps.

45
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,054
Uh, <i>The Quadling Quorum</i>
wants to honor you.

46
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:34,188
They're just not sure
for what yet.

47
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,189
Good to hear.

48
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,124
And someone sent pastries.

49
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:38,592
Good for us.

50
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,493
Hey, send these
to my hovel, please.

51
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:42,196
The gowns from last week?

52
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,965
Oh, maybe, uh, give
to the under-fortunate.

53
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:45,900
-Oh, of course.
-Good idea.

54
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,234
And, you know,

55
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:48,636
while we're at it,
we really should

56
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,504
look into trademarking
the word "good."

57
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:52,640
-Ooh. That's go--
-Ooh.

58
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,141
I mean, I'm goosified.

59
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:55,843
My follicles are screaming.

60
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,646
-I love my job so much.
-Aw. Good.

61
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,614
Madame Morrible.

62
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,049
Forgive me
for keeping you waiting.

63
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,018
I had no idea.

64
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:07,221
Has something happened?
Is it Elphaba?

65
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,990
You mean the Wicked Witch?

66
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:10,024
Right, of course.

67
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,660
-Come in, come in.
-Mrs. Morrible...

68
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,128
Would you like us
to take minutes for you?

69
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,063
...I c-- I can, I can get you,
like, a little snack.

70
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:17,264
You want a little snack?

71
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:19,867
Like a cherry frazzle
or a juice puff?

72
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,736
"Mrs. Morrible"?

73
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:23,037
She's not married.

74
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,139
You sh...

75
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,141
<i>With the Yellow Brick Road</i>

76
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,744
grand opening ahead
and the Wicked Witch attacks

77
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:33,080
growing bolder,
the public is on edge.

78
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:35,082
So it's more important than ever

79
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:38,052
that you lift
everyone's spirits,

80
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:41,155
as only you can.

81
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,591
Accordingly.

82
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:48,062
Oh, Madame, I love it.

83
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,164
What is it?

84
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,099
Your new mode of transport.

85
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:56,037
Your very own
vehicular spherical globule.

86
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,939
So, like, a bubble?

87
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,644
Sure.

88
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,053
Was that supposed to happen?

89
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:13,954
It's all right.

90
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,689
Are you sure?

91
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:17,858
Wha--

92
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,830
Does that do
what I think it does?

93
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,134
No!

94
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,941
I can't.

95
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,377
No way!

96
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,849
I'm obsessulated.

97
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,785
The Wizard had it crafted
especially for you.

98
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:48,956
His Ozness feels it vital
that you, as our Good Witch,

99
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,691
also be airborne.

100
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:53,027
I agree.

101
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,697
But don't fret over
your inability

102
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,699
to produce any actual magic.

103
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:02,002
This invention will
disguise your deficiency.

104
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:05,840
The bubble's mechanism
is cleverly concealed.

105
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:09,376
People will assume that
you are causing it to float

106
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,645
through your own witchly powers.

107
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,882
So, just let them assume.

108
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:16,750
Right.

109
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:18,986
But don't forget this.

110
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:33,634
The wand really sells it.

111
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:39,940
I'll see you
at the opening ceremony.

112
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,976
Thank you so much.

113
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,060
<i>A magic wand?</i>

114
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:02,463
Happy birthday, Galinda.

115
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,334
It's what I've wanted
most of all.

116
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:09,170
Come on, give it a go.

117
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:11,906
Yeah, try it out!

118
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:15,843
Magic! Magic!
Magic! Magic! Magic!

119
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,478
Come on.

120
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:32,326
Oh.

121
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,827
I forgot to say the spell.

122
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,162
-Oh!
-Oh, yeah.

123
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:37,431
The wand. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

124
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:44,004
I hereby commandify that
something magical shall happen!

125
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:45,973
She can't even make
a spark.

126
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:48,976
Look! There's a rainbow.

127
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,779
Wow.

128
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,981
Did you make that?

129
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,082
Um...

130
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,219
Well, you know
how I love rainbows.

131
00:11:58,252 --> 00:11:59,787
Oh, wow!

132
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:01,956
That's my friend!

133
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,093
Go see the rainbow!

134
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,229
Isn't it fantastic?

135
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:11,031
Who is ready for some cake?

136
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:13,968
Go see Rosie and Posie.

137
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,374
What's wrong, dearest?

138
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,842
You got everything you wanted.

139
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,279
I know,
but I want to be magical.

140
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:26,380
For real.

141
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,250
And... I'm not.

142
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:34,121
Oh, but, darlingest,
everyone loves you.

143
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:38,892
Believe me,
that's all you'll ever need.

144
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,996
Where's that smile?

145
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,831
That's my girl.

146
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:01,315
Sweetheart, you coming?

147
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,287
Come on!

148
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,248
Glinda!

149
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:43,924
Fellow Ozians, good news.

150
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:47,061
Now, at last,
all roads lead to the Wizard.

151
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,015
Thank Goodness for you, Glinda,

152
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:11,151
and your handsome swain,
Prince Fiyero,

153
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,488
newly appointed captain
of the Gale Force--

154
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:19,594
assembled by the Wizard himself
to capture the Wicked Witch.

155
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:21,462
Tell us, Captain.

156
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:23,497
How does it feel?

157
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:24,666
It's frustrating.

158
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:27,034
But I became captain
to find her,

159
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,136
and I will keep on searching
until I do.

160
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,205
No!

161
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:33,641
Being engaged.

162
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:39,647
We're engaged?

163
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:41,081
Surprised?

164
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:42,584
Yes.

165
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:44,985
Good. We hoped you'd be.

166
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,387
Um, the Wizard and I.

167
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:41,442
And, Glinda,
dear, we are happy for you.

168
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:44,411
As Press Secretary,
I've striven to ensure

169
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:48,716
that all of Oz knows
the story of your braverism

170
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,984
in the face of the terrifying

171
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:53,053
Wicked Witch of the West.

172
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:16,210
Mmm. Darling?

173
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,482
People are so empty-headed,

174
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:23,350
they'll believe anything.

175
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:26,253
If you'll excuse us
just a clock-tick.

176
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:28,422
Come with me, dearest.

177
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:31,759
What is going on?

178
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:33,393
People are watching.

179
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:34,796
I can't just
stand there grinning,

180
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:36,230
pretending to go along
with all this.

181
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:38,098
Do you think
I like hearing them say

182
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,500
those awful things about her?
I hate it.

183
00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:42,102
Then what are we doing here?
Let's go. Let's go.

184
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,505
-Let's just get out of here.
-I-I can't.

185
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,807
I can't when there are
people looking to me

186
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,575
to raise their spirits.

187
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:53,180
You can't leave
because you can't resist this.

188
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,249
That's the truth.

189
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,286
Well, maybe I can't.

190
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:02,724
Is that so wrong?

191
00:17:02,757 --> 00:17:04,792
I mean, who could?

192
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:06,794
Well, you know who could.

193
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:09,129
We both know
who could and who has.

194
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,464
And I have to find her,

195
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,165
because if someone else
gets there first, she...

196
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,134
Fiyero, I'm worried
for her, too.

197
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,738
And I miss her.

198
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:19,541
Can't you see
she doesn't want to be found?

199
00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:23,277
You've got to face it.

200
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,345
She's made her choice.

201
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:35,590
You're right.

202
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,097
And, look...

203
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:48,101
...if it makes you happy,
of course I'll marry you.

204
00:17:51,873 --> 00:17:54,241
It'll make you happy,
too, right?

205
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,210
You know me. I'm always happy.

206
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,317
Fiyero.

207
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:12,225
Thanks plenty, dearest.

208
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:18,198
He's, um... he's gone
to fetch me a refreshment.

209
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,369
He's so thoughtful that way.

210
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:12,640
It's the Wicked Witch!

211
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:13,741
Take cover!

212
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:17,812
Mount up!

213
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:22,083
Glinda!

214
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:23,751
Take cover, everyone!

215
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:27,655
Everyone, please,
don't be alarmed.

216
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:31,793
She won't hurt you. It's okay.

217
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:33,561
She wants to kill us all!

218
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:34,962
Look!

219
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:52,445
Gale Force, go!

220
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:57,084
Hyah!

221
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:58,553
Fiyero!

222
00:21:58,586 --> 00:22:01,022
Hyah! Come on! Hyah!

223
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:03,456
No, come.

224
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:42,530
Halt!

225
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:16,496
Captain, do you see anything?

226
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:25,640
No.

227
00:23:25,673 --> 00:23:27,775
Come on.

228
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:30,611
We must not rest until
we capture that Wicked Witch.

229
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:48,996
Come on! Let's go!

230
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,464
-Move out.
-Fall in.

231
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:18,693
Fiyero.

232
00:24:19,527 --> 00:24:20,995
Even you.

233
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,035
Madam Governor?

234
00:25:01,068 --> 00:25:04,805
That proposed new regulation,
the Animal Anti-Motility law.

235
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,906
What law?

236
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:10,011
Animals would need
a permit to travel.

237
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:11,612
Munchkinland is the one place

238
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:13,214
in Oz it hasn't been ratified.

239
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:15,016
The League of Governors
is urging you to sign.

240
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:18,019
Nessa, you're not
going to sign that.

241
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:20,755
But if I don't...

242
00:25:20,788 --> 00:25:23,924
people will say,
"She's just like her sister."

243
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:31,532
Give us a clock-tick, Avaric.

244
00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:42,243
Boq, forgive me.

245
00:25:42,276 --> 00:25:46,047
It's just that Elphaba
abandoned me when I needed her.

246
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,582
She didn't even come see me
when Father died.

247
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:50,651
Only you did that.

248
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:53,954
Oz only knows how I'd have coped

249
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:57,858
with all of this without you.

250
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:13,107
And I'm glad
I could be there for you.

251
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:19,847
But I've been thinking
for a while now...

252
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,015
Yes?

253
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:24,785
I think it's time I moved on.

254
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:31,859
I see.

255
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:38,399
Well, if that's how you feel,

256
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,835
I think it's best you leave.

257
00:26:42,136 --> 00:26:43,771
Now.

258
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,918
Nessa, this won't be the
last time we'll see each other.

259
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:00,087
Oh, I know.

260
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:10,898
Attention,
passengers.

261
00:27:10,931 --> 00:27:13,968
This is the final boarding
for the Emerald City Unlimited.

262
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:16,437
Doors will be closing shortly.

263
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,274
Please step inside and make way
for boarding passengers.

264
00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:32,019
Visiting someone special?

265
00:27:32,052 --> 00:27:33,154
Get a new Ozfit.

266
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:35,756
Visit the Wizard's Emporium
in downtown Emerald City.

267
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,925
Next.

268
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,126
Oh.

269
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:41,729
Excuse me.
Um, my train is boarding in...

270
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:43,664
Travel permit?

271
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:46,800
-What?
-All Munchkins are forbidden

272
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,269
to leave Munchkinland

273
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:51,172
without express written
permission of the Governor.

274
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:57,211
She insisted it go
into effect immediately.

275
00:27:57,878 --> 00:28:00,381
...reminder to all passengers...

276
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:02,016
Stop pushing me.

277
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:03,484
-Elsa.
-Go!

278
00:28:03,518 --> 00:28:05,052
-What's happening?
-Keep your hands off my family.

279
00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:06,987
I don't want to hear it,
Munchkins.

280
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:08,789
Move! Forward now, Munchkins.

281
00:28:08,822 --> 00:28:10,057
Go.

282
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,792
This is outrageous.

283
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:13,427
-You cannot treat us like this.
-Go!

284
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,862
Move along, Munchkins.

285
00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:16,197
Next.

286
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,932
This is not the Oz I know.

287
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:19,333
-This is un-Ozian.
-Back in line.

288
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:21,302
Step back. What did I say?

289
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:24,071
Step-- Munchkins, step back.

290
00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:25,206
Back in line.

291
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:43,824
Watch your footing.

292
00:28:43,857 --> 00:28:45,993
Next group. Come on, children.

293
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:47,428
Let's move.
We have to leave now.

294
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:49,096
Stay together!

295
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:51,498
Come along now.

296
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:53,767
Keep moving.

297
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:55,936
Eyes on your children, please.

298
00:29:00,107 --> 00:29:02,376
Don't worry, I'm with you.
I'll never leave you.

299
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:04,044
Don't go too fast.

300
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:06,380
-What is all this?
-Watch your step.

301
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,848
What are you doing?

302
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:09,350
Come, children. Quickly.

303
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:10,484
We must get out of Oz.

304
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:12,987
Don't do this. Please.

305
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,955
-Keep moving.
-Don't leave Oz.

306
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:17,491
Join with me.
Help me fight the Wizard.

307
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:20,427
And wait for
the monkeys to carry us off?

308
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:22,997
That's what happens
to animals who speak out.

309
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,532
And they're never seen again.

310
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:26,568
No.

311
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:28,302
Oz wouldn't be Oz
without all of you.

312
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:31,573
And I know you're frightened,
but this is home.

313
00:29:31,606 --> 00:29:33,340
Belongs to all of us.

314
00:29:33,374 --> 00:29:35,242
Elphaba.

315
00:29:39,213 --> 00:29:40,582
Dulcibear.

316
00:29:40,615 --> 00:29:42,316
Oh, little one.

317
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:46,420
I've missed your bear hugs.

318
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,592
We can't stay here.

319
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,926
It's become rotten.

320
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,462
There's only one thing left
for us to do:

321
00:29:55,496 --> 00:30:01,835
escape through that tunnel
to The Place Beyond Oz.

322
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:06,273
They say The Place Beyond Oz
is just...

323
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:09,544
...emptiness.

324
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:15,550
How will you survive?

325
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:17,484
How will you survive here?

326
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,524
No one in Oz will be happy
until you're dead.

327
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:35,836
Why would you want to stay?

328
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:41,842
I don't know.

329
00:32:06,728 --> 00:32:09,564
Try to understand.

330
00:32:09,597 --> 00:32:12,099
We just can't fight anymore.

331
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:13,601
We have to.

332
00:33:57,572 --> 00:33:59,774
Don't listen to her!

333
00:34:04,177 --> 00:34:05,613
At night, when I close my eyes,

334
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:08,783
I still see that green face.

335
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:13,555
I can't believe it. Is that you?

336
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:15,122
Stay back!

337
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:16,624
When I was just a cub,

338
00:34:16,658 --> 00:34:19,694
she snatched me from
the only home I ever knew.

339
00:34:19,727 --> 00:34:21,161
You were in a cage.

340
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:22,429
If I'd have left you there,

341
00:34:22,462 --> 00:34:24,197
you would never
have learned to speak.

342
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:27,100
They say she's the one
who gave the monkeys wings

343
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:28,703
and gave the Wizard his spies.

344
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,539
Is this true?

345
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:37,144
It's true.

346
00:34:37,177 --> 00:34:39,146
I cast that spell.

347
00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:42,684
And I have to live with that.

348
00:34:44,552 --> 00:34:46,219
If I'd have known
I was being tricked,

349
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:48,188
if I'd have known why,
I would never have...

350
00:34:48,221 --> 00:34:49,724
The Wizard lies.

351
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:52,459
I can prove it.
And if we stand together...

352
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:53,460
Dulcibear!

353
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:54,529
Little one,

354
00:34:54,562 --> 00:35:00,133
I know you'll keep fighting,
because I know you.

355
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:14,181
Thank you, Boq.

356
00:35:29,897 --> 00:35:32,834
Perhaps a friendly game
of cards once I'm done working?

357
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:35,770
Whatever you say,
Madam Governor.

358
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:37,939
I asked you to call me Nessa.

359
00:35:37,972 --> 00:35:40,140
Remember?

360
00:35:40,975 --> 00:35:42,510
Boq.

361
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:48,148
Never mind. I'll call you
when I've finished.

362
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:22,282
Now, who could have left
that door open?

363
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,558
I did.

364
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:40,968
It's so good to see you.

365
00:36:41,002 --> 00:36:43,403
Why are you here?

366
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:47,542
I've tried to keep you
out of all of this, but...

367
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:50,444
I need you.

368
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:52,312
Thought you might have come
to apologize.

369
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:54,247
Apologize?

370
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:55,817
Our father died of shame,

371
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,485
and you didn't even bother
to show up.

372
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,420
You might at least
pretend to be sorry.

373
00:37:00,454 --> 00:37:02,422
For what? He hated me.

374
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:04,291
That's a Wicked thing to say.

375
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:05,760
No, it's not.

376
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:07,394
It's just the truth.

377
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:08,696
Do you know why?

378
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,565
What does it matter now?

379
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:13,233
You're right.

380
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:16,269
Doesn't matter.

381
00:37:17,038 --> 00:37:18,840
Because it's just us.

382
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:20,675
You're the Governor.
People will listen to you,

383
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:22,744
-and together, we...
-Why should I help you?

384
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:25,479
You fly around Oz
with that book,

385
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:27,481
helping animals
you've never even met,

386
00:37:27,515 --> 00:37:29,016
and not once
have you ever thought

387
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,753
-to use your powers to help me.
-You never wanted my help.

388
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:33,420
I do now!

389
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:44,866
I want to go back to the way
we were at school.

390
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:48,903
That night when Boq told me
I was beautiful.

391
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:54,642
It was the first time
I ever wore these shoes.

392
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,012
There was music.

393
00:38:01,749 --> 00:38:05,385
And everything was
still possible.

394
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:37,018
Nessa, I wish there was
something I could do, but...

395
00:38:47,128 --> 00:38:49,931
<i>"Ambulahn dare, pahto, pahpoot.</i>

396
00:38:49,964 --> 00:38:51,464
<i>"Ambulahn dasca,</i>

397
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:52,834
<i>-lahfenahto."</i>
-What are you doing?

398
00:38:52,867 --> 00:38:56,369
<i>"Ambulahn dare, pahto, pahpoot.</i>

399
00:38:56,403 --> 00:38:58,573
<i>-Ambulahn dasca, caldapess."</i>
-Oh.

400
00:38:58,606 --> 00:39:00,508
-Oh, my shoes.
<i>-"Lahfenahto, lahfenahtum."</i>

401
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,643
Oh, they feel like
they're on fire!

402
00:39:02,677 --> 00:39:04,579
<i>"Pede, pede, caldapess!</i>

403
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:07,114
<i>Pede, pede, caldapess!"</i>

404
00:39:19,861 --> 00:39:21,963
I'm floating on air.

405
00:39:42,683 --> 00:39:45,019
Thank you, Elphaba.

406
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:46,453
Nessa?

407
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:47,889
He called me Nessa.
It's working.

408
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:50,457
Nessa, there's something
I have to...

409
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:52,593
Look.

410
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:55,730
You.

411
00:39:55,763 --> 00:39:57,164
-Boq.
-Stay back!

412
00:39:57,798 --> 00:39:59,800
It's just me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

413
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:01,434
Boq, don't be afraid.

414
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:04,437
Elphaba just came
to lift my spirits.

415
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:08,576
You did this to make her happy?

416
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:11,212
I know now anything is possible

417
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:13,480
for both of us.

418
00:40:52,086 --> 00:40:53,453
Nessa.

419
00:40:55,256 --> 00:40:59,126
I lost my heart to Glinda
the moment I first saw her.

420
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,762
Lost your heart?

421
00:41:03,698 --> 00:41:05,032
We'll see about that.

422
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:07,601
-Let him go.
-Don't come any closer!

423
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:09,603
You and your sister.

424
00:41:09,637 --> 00:41:11,572
She's as Wicked as you are,

425
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:13,841
keeping me here like a prisoner.

426
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:15,242
What are you talking about?

427
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:17,044
I am talking about my life!

428
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:21,582
The little that's left of it.

429
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:27,154
You're going to lose
your heart to me, I tell you!

430
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:29,156
If I have to...

431
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,491
I have to...

432
00:41:34,628 --> 00:41:36,130
...magic spell you.

433
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:39,800
There must be a magic spell
in here to capture your heart.

434
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:42,136
-Nessa, no. That's dangerous.
-What is she doing?

435
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:43,738
<i>"Ah tum, ta tayk..."</i>

436
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:45,940
-Stop, Nessa!
<i>-"...ah tum, cortum."</i>

437
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:48,209
You're pronouncing the words
all wrong!

438
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:50,811
-Wh-What is she saying?
<i>-"Ah tum, ta tayk."</i>

439
00:41:50,845 --> 00:41:52,947
I'm going.

440
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,282
<i>"Ah tum."</i>

441
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,756
Boq, what is it?

442
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:03,157
My heart.

443
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:06,894
It feels like it's sh--
like it's shrinking.

444
00:42:06,927 --> 00:42:08,929
-Do something!
-I can't!

445
00:42:08,963 --> 00:42:10,965
A spell from the Grimmerie
can never be reversed.

446
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:13,000
Boq? This is all your fault!

447
00:42:13,034 --> 00:42:14,935
-If you hadn't come here...
-I have to find another spell.

448
00:42:14,969 --> 00:42:16,637
It's the only thing
that might work.

449
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,106
Go, now! Go!

450
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:31,719
<i>"Ambulahn dasca."</i>

451
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:35,524
<i>"Lahfenahto."</i>

452
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:39,693
<i>"Caldapess."</i>

453
00:43:19,834 --> 00:43:21,135
He's sleeping now.

454
00:43:24,805 --> 00:43:26,173
What about his heart?

455
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:27,942
It's all right.

456
00:43:29,143 --> 00:43:31,312
He won't need one now.

457
00:43:31,345 --> 00:43:33,147
The wedding.

458
00:43:35,216 --> 00:43:36,684
Wait, where are you going?

459
00:43:37,685 --> 00:43:39,987
All the most influential people
in Oz will be there.

460
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,289
It's the perfect opportunity
to show them all the truth

461
00:43:42,323 --> 00:43:43,724
about the Wizard.

462
00:43:43,757 --> 00:43:46,393
Oh, please.
Stop lying to yourself.

463
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:49,797
You're going there to find
Fiyero, but it's too late.

464
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,399
Nessa, I have done
everything I could for you,

465
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:54,201
and it hasn't been enough.

466
00:43:54,235 --> 00:43:56,770
Nothing ever will be.

467
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:02,176
Elphaba, don't leave me!

468
00:44:04,778 --> 00:44:06,881
Goodbye, Nessa.

469
00:44:06,914 --> 00:44:08,849
I'm off to see the Wizard.

470
00:44:22,296 --> 00:44:23,731
Where am I?

471
00:44:23,764 --> 00:44:24,965
What happened?

472
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:27,301
It's all right, dearest.

473
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:28,736
You just...

474
00:44:47,454 --> 00:44:49,156
What have you done?

475
00:44:53,794 --> 00:44:54,929
It wasn't me.

476
00:44:54,962 --> 00:44:57,298
I tried to stop her.

477
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:08,442
Boq, please.

478
00:45:10,244 --> 00:45:11,812
What have you done to me?

479
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:13,347
You witch!

480
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,782
It wasn't me! It was her!

481
00:45:14,815 --> 00:45:16,483
It was Elphaba!

482
00:45:30,297 --> 00:45:31,832
Boq!

483
00:45:33,535 --> 00:45:36,904
Ozians of the Emerald City,

484
00:45:36,937 --> 00:45:38,973
today the winds shift

485
00:45:39,006 --> 00:45:42,843
and destiny unfolds
before our very eyes...

486
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:44,546
Mm-hmm.
-...for on this night,

487
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:46,947
by the glorification
of our Wizard,

488
00:45:46,981 --> 00:45:50,017
Glinda the Good
and Prince Fiyero Tigelaar

489
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,920
join hands in unification.

490
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:54,154
Do I have everything I need?

491
00:45:54,188 --> 00:45:56,123
No, I need an earring, please.

492
00:45:56,156 --> 00:45:57,992
Thank you.

493
00:45:58,025 --> 00:46:00,861
Something oldish? Yes.

494
00:46:00,894 --> 00:46:02,296
This is
more than just a wedding.

495
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:05,399
It is a coronation
of hope itself.

496
00:46:07,968 --> 00:46:10,170
<i>Something new?</i>

497
00:46:11,038 --> 00:46:12,973
Absolutely.

498
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:15,142
So let the very foundations

499
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:18,045
of Oz shimmer
with celebratorium...

500
00:46:18,078 --> 00:46:19,280
Let's go!

501
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:21,115
...for today,
Oz writes a new chapter.

502
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:23,117
Rejoicify,

503
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,987
and Oz shall shine forevermore.

504
00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:33,327
Something bartered.

505
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:37,097
And something askew.
I need something askew.

506
00:46:42,903 --> 00:46:45,239
Just give me a clock-tick.

507
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:59,386
Elphaba Thropp,
I know you're out here.

508
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,423
Just come in
before the monkeys spot you.

509
00:47:12,433 --> 00:47:14,134
Elphaba.

510
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:15,969
Galinda.

511
00:47:19,406 --> 00:47:21,609
Get in. Go.

512
00:47:34,656 --> 00:47:36,591
Elphie.

513
00:47:36,624 --> 00:47:38,425
Thank Oz you're alive.

514
00:47:38,459 --> 00:47:40,361
Careful. Your dress.

515
00:47:57,712 --> 00:48:00,981
I still can't believe you
get around on that old thing.

516
00:48:01,014 --> 00:48:02,517
Well, we can't all
come and go by bubble.

517
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,051
True.

518
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:10,592
Are you all right?

519
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:12,359
I'm fine.

520
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:16,531
I just wanted
to come and see you.

521
00:48:16,564 --> 00:48:18,265
That means a lot to me, Elphie.

522
00:48:18,298 --> 00:48:20,934
But if anyone
discoverates you...

523
00:48:20,968 --> 00:48:24,104
I know. I know.

524
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,141
You never saw me.

525
00:48:27,174 --> 00:48:29,276
I was never here.
Do you understand?

526
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:31,378
No. I can't bear this anymore.

527
00:48:31,412 --> 00:48:33,447
I'm taking you
to see the Wizard.

528
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,549
Absolutely not.

529
00:48:34,582 --> 00:48:36,316
-Yes.
-No!

530
00:48:37,117 --> 00:48:40,187
This is between
the Wizard and I.

531
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,456
I understand.
But you have to trust me.

532
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:44,158
I know how to talk to him,

533
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:45,693
and maybe I could help work
something out.

534
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:13,187
♪ Since I've... ♪

535
00:49:14,622 --> 00:49:16,056
What?

536
00:49:45,152 --> 00:49:46,987
You're done.

537
00:49:48,656 --> 00:49:50,424
It's over.

538
00:49:52,527 --> 00:49:54,796
I had a hunch
you'd be coming back to me.

539
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:57,599
I'm not here for you.
I'm here for Oz.

540
00:49:57,632 --> 00:49:59,132
Elphaba.

541
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:00,100
You know, you could've
just exited normally.

542
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:02,637
Just use the door.

543
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,171
Hello?

544
00:50:04,204 --> 00:50:06,641
-Yes?
-Don't hate me.

545
00:50:06,674 --> 00:50:08,108
It's my wedding day,

546
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:10,077
and you cannot refuse
a wedding wish.

547
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:11,478
Well, you can, but it's rude.

548
00:50:11,513 --> 00:50:13,447
I don't have time
for this. Now, listen.

549
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,115
You and I are gonna go
down there together,

550
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:16,584
and you are gonna admit
to her guests

551
00:50:16,618 --> 00:50:18,118
that you have no real power

552
00:50:18,151 --> 00:50:19,587
and that you cannot read
the Grimmerie.

553
00:50:22,724 --> 00:50:24,291
Why is that funny?

554
00:50:24,324 --> 00:50:27,294
Elphaba, uh, I've missed you.

555
00:50:27,327 --> 00:50:30,497
Can't we start again?

556
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:31,566
Yes. Please.

557
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,267
-Just say yes.
-No.

558
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,235
Don't you think I wish I could?

559
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:38,205
I would give anything
to go back to a time when I...

560
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:44,846
...when I actually believed
that you were Wonderful.

561
00:50:44,879 --> 00:50:48,081
"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz."

562
00:50:48,115 --> 00:50:50,585
No one believed in you
more than I did.

563
00:50:52,419 --> 00:50:54,656
But there's no going back.

564
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:55,823
And we can't move forward,

565
00:50:55,857 --> 00:50:57,424
not until everyone knows
what I know.

566
00:50:57,457 --> 00:50:59,159
And once they know the truth...

567
00:50:59,192 --> 00:51:01,261
They're not gonna believe it.

568
00:51:01,295 --> 00:51:02,564
How can you say that?

569
00:51:02,597 --> 00:51:04,231
Well, I'm just being straight
with you.

570
00:51:04,264 --> 00:51:06,568
I could tell 'em
that I'd been lying to 'em

571
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:09,871
till I'm-- forgive me--
blue in the face,

572
00:51:09,904 --> 00:51:12,439
but wouldn't make
any difference.

573
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:15,577
They're never gonna stop
believing in me.

574
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,712
You know why?

575
00:51:17,745 --> 00:51:19,479
Because they don't want to.

576
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:06,728
Watch this.

577
00:52:56,243 --> 00:52:57,277
Ow!

578
00:53:00,347 --> 00:53:02,684
Bee-keek, beak-beak.

579
00:53:04,317 --> 00:53:06,821
Elphie, let's be honest.

580
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:08,623
Your way hasn't worked.

581
00:53:08,656 --> 00:53:10,558
But if you join forces with us,

582
00:53:10,591 --> 00:53:14,294
if people see that you're with
us, they'll begin to trust you.

583
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:16,296
You'll accomplish so much more.

584
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:17,732
Yeah, yeah. So much more.

585
00:53:17,765 --> 00:53:19,801
You know, we could be
like a... like a family.

586
00:53:19,834 --> 00:53:22,603
You know, I've never
really had a family.

587
00:53:22,637 --> 00:53:23,738
Lucky you.

588
00:53:23,771 --> 00:53:27,240
That's why I've wanted
to give the citizens of Oz...

589
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:28,375
everything.

590
00:53:28,408 --> 00:53:29,877
-So you lied to them?
-No.

591
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:31,679
No.

592
00:53:31,713 --> 00:53:33,748
No-- Well, um...

593
00:53:33,781 --> 00:53:36,517
only v-verbally.

594
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:40,287
But those were the lies
that they wanted to hear.

595
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:53,701
You see, back where I come from,

596
00:53:53,735 --> 00:53:55,368
we got a whole lot of people
who believe

597
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:57,270
all sorts of things
that aren't true.

598
00:53:57,304 --> 00:53:59,874
You know what we call it?

599
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:01,408
History.

600
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:03,678
Ooh.

601
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:38,513
It's not my best pupil.

602
00:55:03,504 --> 00:55:04,839
Come with me.

603
00:55:14,447 --> 00:55:17,652
Elphie, aren't you tired
of running?

604
00:55:17,685 --> 00:55:20,822
Think of what we could do.

605
00:55:20,855 --> 00:55:22,523
Together.

606
00:57:12,533 --> 00:57:15,002
Who are you?

607
00:57:15,036 --> 00:57:19,472
And why do you seek me?

608
00:57:19,507 --> 00:57:20,641
Wait.

609
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:40,695
No more blaming the animals.

610
00:57:40,728 --> 00:57:42,196
And the ones
who've left Oz should be

611
00:57:42,229 --> 00:57:43,631
free to return without fear.

612
00:57:43,664 --> 00:57:45,066
Hey, with you by my side,

613
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:47,034
I'm not gonna need to blame
the animals anymore.

614
00:57:47,068 --> 00:57:49,203
You're not gonna need
spies, either,

615
00:57:49,236 --> 00:57:51,238
so set the monkeys free.

616
00:57:51,272 --> 00:57:53,841
Oh, yeah? Hang on. Hang on.

617
00:58:01,048 --> 00:58:03,918
Why? Why?

618
00:58:03,951 --> 00:58:05,987
I think I got it.
I think I got it.

619
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,487
Um...

620
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:13,160
Done.

621
00:58:13,194 --> 00:58:14,962
I did it.

622
00:58:14,996 --> 00:58:17,198
I mean, we did it.

623
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:21,002
I'll see you two
in a clock-tick.

624
00:58:21,035 --> 00:58:25,606
Elphie, I'm so happy.

625
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:30,578
I'm getting married.

626
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:35,182
So, you want me to prove myself?

627
00:58:35,216 --> 00:58:36,951
Oh, my gosh.

628
00:58:36,984 --> 00:58:38,652
Look in your hand.

629
00:58:40,054 --> 00:58:41,756
How'd that get there?

630
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:44,291
It's a key. It's a key.

631
00:58:45,793 --> 00:58:47,728
Aren't you surprised?

632
00:58:47,762 --> 00:58:50,664
I liked that dance.
That was fun. Come here.

633
00:58:50,698 --> 00:58:53,034
Now,
I've been keeping them

634
00:58:53,067 --> 00:58:57,772
locked in here, um,
for their own safety.

635
00:59:00,241 --> 00:59:04,045
But, ah, no need
for that anymore.

636
00:59:04,078 --> 00:59:05,579
Okay.

637
00:59:05,613 --> 00:59:07,348
Hey, you want to come over here
and do the honors?

638
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:12,353
Uh, 'cause if you put that
in-in here, it'll let 'em go.

639
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:14,121
And, uh, I...

640
00:59:14,155 --> 00:59:17,124
Gosh, I-I hope you feel good
about this whole thing, 'cause,

641
00:59:17,158 --> 00:59:20,628
well, you've won,
but I think we all have.

642
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,047
Chistery.

643
00:59:43,751 --> 00:59:46,087
Nothing can change
what's been done to you.

644
00:59:48,189 --> 00:59:51,125
Well... what I've done.

645
00:59:51,792 --> 00:59:54,195
But at least
you have your freedom now.

646
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:58,065
Chistery, can you speak?

647
01:00:00,734 --> 01:00:01,969
Please try.

648
01:00:06,107 --> 01:00:09,176
Well... go on.

649
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:11,912
You're free.

650
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,882
Fly.

651
01:00:27,161 --> 01:00:28,762
Fly.

652
01:00:31,232 --> 01:00:32,433
Fly!

653
01:00:42,776 --> 01:00:44,712
Wonderful. Uh...

654
01:00:44,745 --> 01:00:45,980
Well...

655
01:00:46,013 --> 01:00:47,882
Hey, if you and I
are gonna go down there

656
01:00:47,915 --> 01:00:52,153
and greet those fancy folks,
I'd better, uh, spruce up.

657
01:01:14,308 --> 01:01:16,076
Chistery, what's wrong?

658
01:03:23,937 --> 01:03:25,806
Dr. Dillamond.

659
01:03:29,877 --> 01:03:31,845
Dr. Dillamond.

660
01:03:31,879 --> 01:03:33,480
Can't you speak?

661
01:03:33,515 --> 01:03:35,983
It's me, Elphaba.

662
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:46,960
Let me explain, 'cause th--

663
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:49,430
this is not what it looks like.

664
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:57,338
Elphaba, some animals
cannot be trusted.

665
01:03:57,371 --> 01:03:59,039
Yes.

666
01:03:59,641 --> 01:04:01,442
I know that now.

667
01:04:06,514 --> 01:04:08,949
And these sacred vows

668
01:04:08,982 --> 01:04:10,484
are to be entered into

669
01:04:10,518 --> 01:04:14,288
not lightly but merrily.

670
01:04:15,189 --> 01:04:18,359
Elphaba, try to understand.

671
01:04:18,392 --> 01:04:20,127
No.

672
01:04:21,228 --> 01:04:22,963
I'm not a bad man. I'm just a...

673
01:04:22,996 --> 01:04:25,499
Yes, you are.
You're a very bad man.

674
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:33,073
You once asked me
what my heart's desire was,

675
01:04:33,107 --> 01:04:35,376
and I know now what that is.

676
01:04:37,344 --> 01:04:40,114
And that is to fight you
till the day I die!

677
01:04:47,555 --> 01:04:49,089
Run.

678
01:04:54,395 --> 01:04:56,430
Wha--

679
01:04:58,232 --> 01:04:59,500
And do you, Glinda...

680
01:05:02,737 --> 01:05:06,273
What is that horrendible sound?

681
01:05:21,723 --> 01:05:23,525
Move!

682
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,200
Stay there.

683
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:39,440
Fiyero!

684
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:55,189
This is the work
of the Wicked Witch!

685
01:05:55,222 --> 01:05:57,391
She wants to kill us all!

686
01:06:17,812 --> 01:06:19,514
No--

687
01:06:22,483 --> 01:06:24,752
How does it feel to have
your voice taken away?

688
01:06:25,787 --> 01:06:28,055
Silence, Witch!

689
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:32,727
Water.

690
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,662
Lots of it. Bring water!

691
01:06:34,696 --> 01:06:35,763
Yes, sir.

692
01:06:35,797 --> 01:06:37,799
As much as you can carry.

693
01:06:37,832 --> 01:06:40,267
A little help?

694
01:06:43,337 --> 01:06:45,205
Ah.

695
01:06:46,841 --> 01:06:48,543
Please.

696
01:06:50,545 --> 01:06:52,614
Thank you.

697
01:06:52,647 --> 01:06:55,282
That was, uh, unpleasant.

698
01:06:57,685 --> 01:07:00,487
Well, I think my trachea

699
01:07:00,522 --> 01:07:01,789
is otherwi--

700
01:07:01,823 --> 01:07:03,825
What? What are you doing?

701
01:07:03,858 --> 01:07:06,093
-Shush, you. Get in.
-What?

702
01:07:06,126 --> 01:07:07,562
Get in.

703
01:07:08,395 --> 01:07:09,831
Unless you want
the guests to know

704
01:07:09,864 --> 01:07:11,533
the truth about their Wizard.

705
01:07:11,966 --> 01:07:13,400
Get in!

706
01:07:13,433 --> 01:07:15,335
Yes, yes.

707
01:07:36,858 --> 01:07:38,458
Your Ozness!

708
01:07:38,893 --> 01:07:41,563
Fiyero. What are you...

709
01:07:41,596 --> 01:07:43,363
What is happening?

710
01:07:43,397 --> 01:07:46,233
What's happened is that
these two traitors...

711
01:07:46,266 --> 01:07:47,635
Not another word, Your Ozness.

712
01:07:47,669 --> 01:07:49,871
Darling, have you misplaced
your mind?

713
01:07:49,904 --> 01:07:51,673
What are you doing?

714
01:08:07,254 --> 01:08:09,256
I'm going with her.

715
01:08:09,891 --> 01:08:11,659
-What?
-What?

716
01:08:13,861 --> 01:08:15,162
Let's go.

717
01:08:15,195 --> 01:08:16,731
-What?
-Let's go.

718
01:08:16,764 --> 01:08:18,766
Wait. What?

719
01:08:19,534 --> 01:08:23,605
You mean to tell me
that the two of you...

720
01:08:23,638 --> 01:08:26,708
-This whole time?
-No, it wasn't like that.

721
01:08:26,741 --> 01:08:28,509
Go.

722
01:08:30,878 --> 01:08:32,714
Now.

723
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,655
You deserve each other.

724
01:08:45,526 --> 01:08:47,762
You frightened me.

725
01:08:47,795 --> 01:08:50,364
For a while there,
I thought you changed.

726
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:57,471
I have changed.

727
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:08,382
This dulls the pain,
if you want a swig?

728
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,657
No, no, no, no!

729
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:18,926
No! No!

730
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,260
We've got the water, Madame.

731
01:09:20,293 --> 01:09:21,929
Fools! You're too late.

732
01:09:21,963 --> 01:09:24,398
Get out!

733
01:09:24,431 --> 01:09:26,199
How could you let this happen?

734
01:09:26,233 --> 01:09:28,836
Uh, do you have a hairpin?

735
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:30,203
Thanks.

736
01:09:30,237 --> 01:09:33,775
Uh, she and I had a deal.

737
01:09:33,808 --> 01:09:36,678
But, uh...

738
01:09:36,711 --> 01:09:38,713
she double-crossed me.

739
01:09:39,379 --> 01:09:41,481
We must smoke her out,

740
01:09:41,516 --> 01:09:44,217
force her to show herself.

741
01:09:44,251 --> 01:09:45,485
Uh, without the monkeys,

742
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,722
I don't know
how we're gonna do that.

743
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:50,625
Her sister.

744
01:09:52,426 --> 01:09:54,361
Use her sister.

745
01:09:55,930 --> 01:10:01,334
Spread a rumor
that her sister's in trouble.

746
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:04,204
She'll fly to her side,
and you'll have her.

747
01:10:06,808 --> 01:10:10,343
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to lie down.

748
01:10:10,377 --> 01:10:12,580
I have a bit of a headache.

749
01:10:13,715 --> 01:10:15,750
A rumor won't do.

750
01:10:16,517 --> 01:10:18,986
Elphaba's too smart.
That's right.

751
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:22,890
These things must be
done delicately.

752
01:10:22,924 --> 01:10:25,258
Perhaps...

753
01:10:25,292 --> 01:10:27,528
a change in the weather.

754
01:14:14,889 --> 01:14:16,991
You're beautiful.

755
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:21,195
You don't have to lie to me.

756
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,608
It's not lying.

757
01:14:35,609 --> 01:14:36,844
It's...

758
01:14:36,877 --> 01:14:38,879
What is it?

759
01:14:39,547 --> 01:14:41,882
It's looking at things
another way.

760
01:17:44,798 --> 01:17:45,900
Take cover!

761
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:47,034
Get inside! Get inside!

762
01:18:10,824 --> 01:18:13,093
Boq! Boq!

763
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:14,962
Where are you?

764
01:18:15,963 --> 01:18:17,932
Come on! Come on! Inside!

765
01:18:17,965 --> 01:18:19,233
Stay calm.

766
01:18:19,266 --> 01:18:21,235
Move! Go!

767
01:18:22,503 --> 01:18:24,171
Boq!

768
01:18:37,151 --> 01:18:38,986
You can't go on living here.

769
01:18:39,019 --> 01:18:41,488
-They'll find you.
-I'll be all right.

770
01:18:41,523 --> 01:18:43,757
Listen.

771
01:18:44,992 --> 01:18:47,328
My family has a castle
in Kiamo Ko.

772
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:50,231
-Never lived in it.
-Where do you live?

773
01:18:51,432 --> 01:18:52,534
In the other castle.

774
01:18:52,567 --> 01:18:54,235
Okay.

775
01:18:54,268 --> 01:18:56,136
-Of course. -I mean,
it's the perfect hideout.

776
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:58,872
There's tunnels,
secret passageways.

777
01:19:00,007 --> 01:19:01,742
You'll be safer there.

778
01:19:03,477 --> 01:19:05,547
Boq!

779
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:08,115
-Where are you?
-What?

780
01:19:08,148 --> 01:19:10,150
Boq!

781
01:19:11,252 --> 01:19:13,287
Boq!

782
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,122
What is it?

783
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:17,391
What's wrong?

784
01:19:20,127 --> 01:19:23,297
This isn't gonna make
any sense, but...

785
01:19:25,567 --> 01:19:27,368
There's a house.

786
01:19:29,103 --> 01:19:30,838
And it's flying through the sky.

787
01:19:42,016 --> 01:19:45,419
Hey, hey, hey.

788
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:46,954
My sister.

789
01:19:46,987 --> 01:19:48,455
-She's in danger.
I have to get to her. -What?

790
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:50,391
-I'm coming with you.
-No.

791
01:19:50,424 --> 01:19:52,059
It's too dangerous.

792
01:19:55,963 --> 01:19:57,931
Will we ever see
each other again?

793
01:20:01,468 --> 01:20:06,307
Elphaba, we are going to be
together always.

794
01:20:07,941 --> 01:20:10,144
You can see houses
flying through the sky,

795
01:20:10,177 --> 01:20:12,346
but you can't see that?

796
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:41,235
-This way, dear.
-Goodbye, Dorothy.

797
01:21:41,268 --> 01:21:42,169
Bye, Dodo.

798
01:21:42,202 --> 01:21:44,972
It's just that one road
the whole time.

799
01:21:46,508 --> 01:21:49,176
Take your time.
Hurry up, darling.

800
01:22:20,742 --> 01:22:22,510
Goodbye, Nessa.

801
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:36,356
-What a touching
display of grief. -Oh, shiz.

802
01:22:37,357 --> 01:22:38,392
I scare you?

803
01:22:39,026 --> 01:22:41,629
I seem to have
that effect on people.

804
01:22:42,262 --> 01:22:45,667
I would appreciate a moment
to say goodbye to my sister.

805
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,134
Alone.

806
01:22:47,769 --> 01:22:49,369
Of course.

807
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:08,188
Oh, Nessa.

808
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:12,092
Forgive me.

809
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:14,161
Oh, Elphaba,
don't blame yourself, please.

810
01:23:14,194 --> 01:23:16,096
It's dreadful, it is.

811
01:23:16,129 --> 01:23:20,602
I mean...
to have a house fall on you...

812
01:23:20,635 --> 01:23:24,037
But accidents will happen.

813
01:23:24,071 --> 01:23:25,540
And...

814
01:23:29,644 --> 01:23:31,411
You call that an accident?

815
01:23:33,247 --> 01:23:36,216
You think cyclones just appear
out of the blue?

816
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,417
I don't know.

817
01:23:37,451 --> 01:23:39,119
I never really thought
about it...

818
01:23:39,152 --> 01:23:40,788
And how dare you send
that mulish farm girl

819
01:23:40,822 --> 01:23:42,122
off to see the Wizard,

820
01:23:42,155 --> 01:23:43,758
as if he could do
anything to help?

821
01:23:43,791 --> 01:23:45,660
She's lost. She's far from home.

822
01:23:45,693 --> 01:23:47,529
She took a dead woman's shoes.

823
01:23:47,562 --> 01:23:48,530
I had to do something.

824
01:23:48,563 --> 01:23:50,798
I'm a public figure now.
People expect me to...

825
01:23:50,832 --> 01:23:51,833
Lie?

826
01:23:51,866 --> 01:23:54,434
Be encouraging.

827
01:23:54,468 --> 01:23:56,671
Those shoes are all
I have left of my sister.

828
01:23:56,704 --> 01:23:59,039
They weren't yours to give.

829
01:24:01,643 --> 01:24:05,078
Yes, well, it seems
a lot of us are taking things

830
01:24:05,112 --> 01:24:07,582
that don't belong to us now,
aren't we?

831
01:24:08,215 --> 01:24:10,818
No, you just wait a clock-tick.

832
01:24:10,852 --> 01:24:12,554
It might be hard for you
to comprehend

833
01:24:12,587 --> 01:24:16,490
that someone like him
could choose someone like me,

834
01:24:16,524 --> 01:24:19,661
but it's happened,
and it's real.

835
01:24:19,694 --> 01:24:22,697
And you can wave that
ridiculous wand all you want.

836
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:24,231
You can't change it.

837
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:27,167
He never belonged to you.

838
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,671
He doesn't love you.

839
01:24:29,704 --> 01:24:31,539
He never did.

840
01:24:31,573 --> 01:24:32,640
He loves me.

841
01:24:34,141 --> 01:24:35,677
Oh, my...

842
01:24:43,918 --> 01:24:45,152
Feel better?

843
01:24:45,185 --> 01:24:47,387
I do.

844
01:24:47,421 --> 01:24:48,590
Good.

845
01:24:52,594 --> 01:24:54,227
Me, too.

846
01:24:58,933 --> 01:25:00,367
Are you crazy?

847
01:25:01,368 --> 01:25:03,871
Excuse me.
What do you think you're doing?

848
01:25:03,905 --> 01:25:07,374
Come on!
Come on! Bring it!

849
01:25:07,407 --> 01:25:08,576
Get back!

850
01:25:12,914 --> 01:25:15,215
Get-- Oh! Oh!

851
01:25:15,248 --> 01:25:17,619
Let's go!

852
01:25:19,787 --> 01:25:21,623
You...

853
01:25:24,892 --> 01:25:26,661
Please.

854
01:25:26,694 --> 01:25:28,563
Where'd you get that?

855
01:25:33,768 --> 01:25:34,902
What are you doing?

856
01:25:39,941 --> 01:25:42,577
Come on. Let's go, greenie!

857
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:43,745
Use your hands!

858
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:47,180
Come on!

859
01:25:47,214 --> 01:25:48,415
-Bring it on!
-You're out of your mind!

860
01:25:48,448 --> 01:25:49,584
-Get off of me!
-No!

861
01:25:49,617 --> 01:25:51,385
Attention!

862
01:25:51,418 --> 01:25:52,787
-Halt in the name of the Wizard!
-Oh, come on!

863
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:54,421
-Off of me!
-Ow! Ow! -Let her go.

864
01:25:54,454 --> 01:25:55,657
No, no, no, no.
I almost had her.

865
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:56,891
I almost had her.

866
01:25:56,924 --> 01:25:58,793
I almost had her.

867
01:25:58,826 --> 01:26:00,394
Easy.

868
01:26:00,427 --> 01:26:01,929
Sorry it took us so long
to get here, Your Goodness.

869
01:26:04,966 --> 01:26:06,466
You were a part of this?

870
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,935
-Elphaba, no...
-I can't believe

871
01:26:07,969 --> 01:26:10,605
you would stoop so low
as to use my sister's death

872
01:26:10,638 --> 01:26:11,471
to capture me.

873
01:26:11,506 --> 01:26:13,407
I never meant to take it
this far. I...

874
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,843
Let the green girl go.

875
01:26:16,511 --> 01:26:19,547
Else explain to all Oz
how the Wizard's guards

876
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:22,282
watched while
Glinda the Good was slain.

877
01:26:38,398 --> 01:26:40,768
-Elphaba, go.
-No. Not without you.

878
01:26:40,802 --> 01:26:42,436
Go!

879
01:26:43,571 --> 01:26:44,839
Go.

880
01:26:44,872 --> 01:26:46,674
I...

881
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:50,377
Now.

882
01:26:53,681 --> 01:26:55,215
Go.

883
01:27:12,332 --> 01:27:14,401
Please, protect her.

884
01:27:44,599 --> 01:27:46,033
No! You're hurting him!
Stop it now!

885
01:27:46,067 --> 01:27:47,902
Stop it.

886
01:27:47,935 --> 01:27:49,302
In the name of Goodness, stop!

887
01:27:52,206 --> 01:27:54,041
Can't you see
he wasn't going to harm me?

888
01:27:54,075 --> 01:27:55,676
He just...

889
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:01,481
He loves her.

890
01:28:01,516 --> 01:28:03,518
Glinda, I am so sorry.

891
01:28:03,551 --> 01:28:05,653
Take him out to that field.

892
01:28:05,686 --> 01:28:06,554
What? No, please.

893
01:28:06,587 --> 01:28:08,455
Put him up on those poles
till he tells us

894
01:28:08,488 --> 01:28:09,690
-where the Witch went.
-You're hurting him. No.

895
01:28:09,724 --> 01:28:12,059
Fiyero! No! Please!
Let go of me!

896
01:28:12,093 --> 01:28:15,563
Fiyero! Fiyero!

897
01:32:18,205 --> 01:32:19,673
You have visitors.

898
01:32:19,707 --> 01:32:21,842
A girl from the land of Kansas

899
01:32:21,876 --> 01:32:24,779
and three friends
she picked up along the way.

900
01:32:24,812 --> 01:32:27,048
A man made of tin,
another made of straw

901
01:32:27,081 --> 01:32:29,216
and a very nervous lion.

902
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:32,186
They all want something
they don't have, of course.

903
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:33,788
I'm not seeing anybody.

904
01:32:34,622 --> 01:32:37,725
But these are visitors
we can use.

905
01:32:53,374 --> 01:32:55,076
Bring me the broomstick

906
01:32:55,109 --> 01:32:57,678
of the
Wicked Witch of the West...

907
01:32:58,846 --> 01:33:04,185
...so I have proof
that she's dead.

908
01:33:57,138 --> 01:33:59,106
Kill her!

909
01:34:11,485 --> 01:34:15,055
And this is more than
just a service to the Wizard.

910
01:34:15,089 --> 01:34:18,292
I have a personal score
to settle with Elph--

911
01:34:18,325 --> 01:34:19,760
with the Witch!

912
01:34:19,793 --> 01:34:21,729
Yeah! Someone, kill her!

913
01:34:32,373 --> 01:34:34,275
And I'm not the only one.

914
01:34:35,809 --> 01:34:38,812
Tell them.
Tell them what she did to you.

915
01:34:39,747 --> 01:34:43,484
How you were just a cub
and she cub-napped you.

916
01:39:14,321 --> 01:39:16,123
Madame, we have
got to stop this.

917
01:39:16,156 --> 01:39:17,458
It's gone too far.

918
01:39:17,491 --> 01:39:20,160
I think Elphaba can
take care of herself.

919
01:39:23,631 --> 01:39:25,332
Madame.

920
01:39:28,268 --> 01:39:30,003
Something has been troubling me.

921
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:36,109
About Nessa and that cyclone.

922
01:39:39,313 --> 01:39:41,148
Sad.

923
01:39:41,181 --> 01:39:43,383
I suppose it was just her time.

924
01:39:47,755 --> 01:39:49,323
Was it?

925
01:39:53,494 --> 01:39:55,229
Was it? What did you do?

926
01:39:55,262 --> 01:39:58,332
Now, you listen to me, missy.

927
01:39:58,365 --> 01:40:00,768
--You may be fooling
the rest of Oz,

928
01:40:00,802 --> 01:40:02,637
but you're not fooling me.

929
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:05,105
You wanted this
from the beginning.

930
01:40:05,138 --> 01:40:06,774
"Galinda."

931
01:40:06,808 --> 01:40:09,777
And now you're getting
what you wanted.

932
01:40:09,811 --> 01:40:13,515
-So just do what you do best.
-No. No.

933
01:40:13,548 --> 01:40:15,550
Smile.

934
01:40:15,583 --> 01:40:17,619
Wave.

935
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:22,022
And shut up.

936
01:41:00,728 --> 01:41:03,263
I need your help.

937
01:41:34,829 --> 01:41:36,798
Monkeys!

938
01:41:36,831 --> 01:41:40,167
Find that Dorothy,

939
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:43,270
and bring back
my sister's shoes!

940
01:42:11,699 --> 01:42:14,368
Oh, for Oz's sake,
stop crying!

941
01:42:14,401 --> 01:42:15,903
I can't listen to it anymore.

942
01:42:15,937 --> 01:42:17,772
You want to get home and see
your Aunt what's-her-name again?

943
01:42:17,805 --> 01:42:19,373
-Please stop.
-Then get those shoes

944
01:42:19,406 --> 01:42:20,608
-off your feet!
-I'm so sorry.

945
01:42:22,577 --> 01:42:24,712
I want to go home.

946
01:42:26,547 --> 01:42:28,549
They're coming for you.

947
01:42:30,450 --> 01:42:32,920
Let the little girl go.

948
01:42:32,954 --> 01:42:34,354
Go away.

949
01:42:35,556 --> 01:42:37,792
Elphaba, you can't
go on like this.

950
01:42:37,825 --> 01:42:40,561
I can do whatever I want.
Haven't you heard?

951
01:42:41,929 --> 01:42:43,698
I'm the Wicked Witch
of the West.

952
01:42:48,970 --> 01:42:50,972
Chistery, at last.

953
01:42:51,005 --> 01:42:52,674
What took you so long?

954
01:42:52,707 --> 01:42:54,575
What is this?

955
01:43:01,749 --> 01:43:03,584
Elphie, what is that?

956
01:43:09,356 --> 01:43:11,693
It's Fiyero, isn't it?

957
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:17,565
Is he...

958
01:43:21,602 --> 01:43:23,705
We've seen his face
for the last time.

959
01:43:23,738 --> 01:43:25,640
Oh, no.

960
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:38,786
You're right.

961
01:43:40,054 --> 01:43:41,589
It's time.

962
01:43:45,626 --> 01:43:46,728
I surrender.

963
01:43:48,361 --> 01:43:51,264
What? Wait.

964
01:43:56,637 --> 01:43:58,472
Elphaba, what are you doing?

965
01:43:58,505 --> 01:44:00,474
Glinda, you can't be found
here with me.

966
01:44:00,508 --> 01:44:02,375
-You must go.
-Elphie, no. I...

967
01:44:02,409 --> 01:44:04,011
Please, you must now.

968
01:44:04,045 --> 01:44:05,613
Fine.

969
01:44:05,646 --> 01:44:07,414
I'll go and I'll tell everyone
the truth about you,

970
01:44:07,447 --> 01:44:09,884
-that you're not who they say
you are. -No, you can't.

971
01:44:09,917 --> 01:44:12,285
They'll just turn against you.

972
01:44:12,319 --> 01:44:15,322
-Well, I don't care.
-Well, I do.

973
01:44:16,057 --> 01:44:18,593
I need you to promise that
you won't try to clear my name.

974
01:44:18,626 --> 01:44:20,528
No. What? Why would I do that?
I'll tell them everything.

975
01:44:20,561 --> 01:44:21,896
-Please. -No, I don't want you
to do that. Please.

976
01:44:21,929 --> 01:44:23,598
I'll tell them you're not
who they say you are.

977
01:44:23,631 --> 01:44:24,866
I just want you
to just listen for a minute.

978
01:44:24,899 --> 01:44:26,534
-Please, please just...
-Just promise me!

979
01:44:27,201 --> 01:44:29,804
Why would you ask me
to promise that?

980
01:44:34,742 --> 01:44:37,979
Because they need someone
to be Wicked

981
01:44:38,012 --> 01:44:39,781
so that you can be Good.

982
01:44:49,389 --> 01:44:50,691
Just look at me.

983
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:55,462
Not with your eyes.

984
01:44:55,495 --> 01:44:57,430
With theirs.

985
01:45:44,879 --> 01:45:47,114
Here. Take it.

986
01:45:47,148 --> 01:45:49,150
-What? Elphie...
-Go on.

987
01:45:49,183 --> 01:45:50,718
Take it.

988
01:45:50,751 --> 01:45:53,921
But you know I...
I can't read this. I...

989
01:45:53,955 --> 01:45:55,723
Well, you'll have to learn.

990
01:45:55,756 --> 01:45:58,826
We can't let "Good" be
just a word.

991
01:46:00,027 --> 01:46:02,395
It has to mean something.

992
01:46:04,464 --> 01:46:06,499
It has to change things.

993
01:46:43,738 --> 01:46:45,940
You know, um...

994
01:46:51,245 --> 01:46:53,514
You're the only friend
I ever had.

995
01:46:56,517 --> 01:46:58,052
And I've had so many friends.

996
01:47:02,089 --> 01:47:03,891
But only one that mattered.

997
01:51:24,485 --> 01:51:26,854
Come on. Come on, quick.

998
01:51:27,922 --> 01:51:30,090
No one can know you were here.

999
01:51:36,964 --> 01:51:39,066
-You stay here.
-What?

1000
01:51:39,099 --> 01:51:41,135
Everything's gonna be fine.

1001
01:51:41,168 --> 01:51:42,937
I love you.

1002
01:51:44,838 --> 01:51:46,140
I love you, too.

1003
01:54:21,428 --> 01:54:23,097
Oh, Elphie.

1004
01:54:39,581 --> 01:54:42,015
Miss Glinda.

1005
01:55:20,087 --> 01:55:21,422
She's dead.

1006
01:55:24,158 --> 01:55:26,427
-Do you have her broomstick?
-No.

1007
01:55:27,161 --> 01:55:29,430
But I do have something else
that belonged to her.

1008
01:55:29,463 --> 01:55:31,432
It was a keepsake.

1009
01:55:31,465 --> 01:55:32,567
She told me herself.

1010
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,234
It belonged to her mother.

1011
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:38,238
This belonged to...

1012
01:55:39,541 --> 01:55:41,074
...her mother?

1013
01:56:22,449 --> 01:56:24,318
So Elphaba was yours all along.

1014
01:56:24,351 --> 01:56:27,254
That's why she had such powers.

1015
01:56:27,287 --> 01:56:29,624
She was a child of both worlds.

1016
01:56:29,657 --> 01:56:31,626
Oh, my Lord.

1017
01:56:33,795 --> 01:56:35,295
What have I done?

1018
01:56:38,365 --> 01:56:41,134
You have caused great harm.

1019
01:56:41,168 --> 01:56:43,303
Which is why
you will be leaving Oz.

1020
01:56:43,337 --> 01:56:45,105
Today.

1021
01:56:51,078 --> 01:56:53,380
Did you hear what I said?

1022
01:56:53,413 --> 01:56:57,050
And what...
what will I tell people?

1023
01:56:57,084 --> 01:56:59,119
Make something up.

1024
01:57:00,555 --> 01:57:02,322
You're good at that.

1025
01:57:24,846 --> 01:57:26,681
Excuse me.

1026
01:57:26,714 --> 01:57:28,315
Hello.

1027
01:57:28,348 --> 01:57:31,151
What? What do you want?

1028
01:57:31,184 --> 01:57:33,253
Look out your window.

1029
01:57:34,622 --> 01:57:35,857
Come on.

1030
01:57:35,890 --> 01:57:38,158
You don't want to miss this.

1031
01:57:43,297 --> 01:57:45,432
Excuse me, please.
Don't leave without us.

1032
01:57:45,465 --> 01:57:47,134
Please. I-I want to go home.

1033
01:57:47,167 --> 01:57:50,504
Ugh, I swear it never ends
with that girl.

1034
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:57,244
The Wizard is taking
a permanent leave of absence.

1035
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:04,251
Not a rumor, a fact.

1036
01:58:04,284 --> 01:58:06,486
The kind that is true.

1037
01:58:07,755 --> 01:58:09,423
Glinda, dear.

1038
01:58:09,456 --> 01:58:13,260
Can you not find it
in your heart t-to forgive me?

1039
01:58:14,194 --> 01:58:16,564
As Oz is my witness,

1040
01:58:16,598 --> 01:58:20,400
I can see now
how truly good you are.

1041
01:58:22,169 --> 01:58:24,471
Actually, I'm not.

1042
01:58:24,504 --> 01:58:26,440
Not yet.

1043
01:58:26,473 --> 01:58:27,775
But just think, Madame.

1044
01:58:27,809 --> 01:58:31,411
We have so many cages,
and all recently vacated.

1045
01:58:31,445 --> 01:58:33,213
You'll have your pick.

1046
01:58:33,246 --> 01:58:36,483
Although I can't imagine
you'll hold up very well.

1047
01:58:36,517 --> 01:58:41,522
I mean, my personal opinion is
you do not have what it takes.

1048
01:58:42,757 --> 01:58:44,692
I hope you prove me wrong.

1049
01:58:45,693 --> 01:58:47,194
I doubt you will.

1050
01:58:48,630 --> 01:58:50,364
What are you doing?
Let go of me! Let...

1051
02:00:11,746 --> 02:00:13,815
Whoo! Yep.

1052
02:00:15,348 --> 02:00:17,350
Well, this has been fun.

1053
02:00:17,384 --> 02:00:19,386
As you can imagine,
I have much to attend to

1054
02:00:19,419 --> 02:00:20,855
with the Wizard's
unexpected departure,

1055
02:00:20,888 --> 02:00:25,459
so if there are no further
questions, I'm gonna go.

1056
02:00:25,492 --> 02:00:27,327
Glinda.

1057
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:29,463
Is it true you were her friend?

1058
02:00:29,496 --> 02:00:30,998
What?

1059
02:00:31,032 --> 02:00:32,466
Sorry. One sec.

1060
02:00:33,801 --> 02:00:35,368
What?

1061
02:00:35,402 --> 02:00:38,305
Is it true you were her friend?

1062
02:00:41,943 --> 02:00:43,611
Friend?

1063
02:00:45,580 --> 02:00:46,514
Yes.

1064
02:00:47,949 --> 02:00:50,551
I-I mean, I did know her.

1065
02:00:51,819 --> 02:00:54,454
That is...

1066
02:00:54,488 --> 02:00:56,490
our paths did cross.

1067
02:01:01,896 --> 02:01:03,631
At school.

1068
02:01:11,572 --> 02:01:12,874
Wait.

1069
02:01:15,943 --> 02:01:17,512
I have something more to say.

1070
02:01:27,088 --> 02:01:28,589
Fellow Ozians...

1071
02:01:52,947 --> 02:01:54,782
All Ozians.

1072
02:01:55,716 --> 02:01:57,952
Yes, come out.

1073
02:01:57,985 --> 02:02:00,087
Wherever you are, come out.

1074
02:02:03,758 --> 02:02:04,826
Friends.

1075
02:02:07,695 --> 02:02:10,932
Because I don't see
any enemies here.

1076
02:02:16,604 --> 02:02:19,607
We have been through
a frightening time.

1077
02:02:20,241 --> 02:02:22,009
And there will be other times

1078
02:02:22,043 --> 02:02:24,477
and other things
that frighten us.

1079
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:28,348
But if you'll let me...

1080
02:02:29,951 --> 02:02:32,352
...I'd like to try to help.

1081
02:02:33,486 --> 02:02:34,922
To change things.

1082
02:02:39,527 --> 02:02:43,463
I'd like to try to be
Glinda the Good.

1083
02:03:52,033 --> 02:03:54,068
It worked.

1084
02:03:54,101 --> 02:03:55,770
They all think you're dead.

1085
02:03:55,803 --> 02:03:57,504
Fiyero?

1086
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:04,845
See?

1087
02:04:06,614 --> 02:04:07,982
Good as new.

1088
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:21,095
You saved my life.

1089
02:04:30,871 --> 02:04:33,473
You're beautiful.

1090
02:04:35,609 --> 02:04:37,111
You don't have to lie to me.

1091
02:04:38,646 --> 02:04:40,915
It's not lying.

1092
02:04:42,116 --> 02:04:44,752
It's...

1093
02:04:44,785 --> 02:04:47,688
It's looking at things
in another way.

1094
02:04:48,589 --> 02:04:50,057
Time to go.

1095
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,936
<i>I wish that Glinda</i>
<i>could know we're alive.</i>

1096
02:05:40,307 --> 02:05:42,576
<i>But I know she can't.</i>

1097
02:05:44,812 --> 02:05:46,781
<i>No one can ever know.</i>
