1
00:00:45,443 --> 00:00:46,527
On your feet!

2
00:01:17,683 --> 00:01:18,809
You were alone?

3
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:23,355
Spy, you were alone?

4
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:24,940
I like to be alone.

5
00:01:26,317 --> 00:01:28,027
What did you come here for?

6
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:31,322
You got a lot of nice stuff.

7
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:32,823
Other people's stuff.

8
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:36,619
"To the victor belongs the spoils."

9
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,038
"To the victor"?

10
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,540
Berlin's in rubble.

11
00:01:41,707 --> 00:01:43,334
The Führer's in hiding.

12
00:01:44,543 --> 00:01:46,295
You lost.

13
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:53,052
What? What?

14
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,178
Hey!

15
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:55,429
Hey, wait a second. Guys!

16
00:03:18,762 --> 00:03:21,140
Looks like they're leaving without you guys.

17
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:24,560
Tell us your story, or die.

18
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:26,187
Story.

19
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:29,398
Okay, okay.

20
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:30,524
Well...

21
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,902
it all started...

22
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:37,656
once upon a time,
when this village...

23
00:03:37,823 --> 00:03:42,244
of stupid blue-eyed boys
decided to join hands together...

24
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:45,706
and follow this sweaty little pied piper
named Adolf...

25
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:06,852
No.

26
00:07:50,242 --> 00:07:51,160
Oh, my!

27
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:18,604
Get off of me!

28
00:08:46,966 --> 00:08:49,552
There's one reason you're still alive,
birdwatcher.

29
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:53,764
Who sent you?

30
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:55,099
What was your mission?

31
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:57,268
Please, Colonel, no. I beg you.

32
00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:59,728
My name is Basil Shaw.

33
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,648
I'm a professor at Oxford.

34
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:04,442
An archeologist.

35
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:13,117
There you are.

36
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:28,215
I have a daughter. I beg you.

37
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:31,552
I guarantee you will never see
your child again, Mr. Shaw.

38
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:37,850
Unless you explain
why your accomplice had this.

39
00:10:00,414 --> 00:10:04,543
We were told that the Lance of Longinus
could be found at the fortress.

40
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:06,337
We were looking for it.

41
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:08,380
Why?

42
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:11,008
Because of its power?

43
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:14,845
It has no power.

44
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:20,101
My friend and I were trying to save history.

45
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,142
Twelfth century. Thirteenth century.

46
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:45,436
Ramesses II.

47
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:48,564
None of this stuff is fake.

48
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,985
I gotta stop this train.

49
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,922
What the hell?

50
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:20,800
Indy?

51
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:21,801
Baz?

52
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:23,135
You're alive!

53
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:24,845
So far.

54
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:27,932
I thought I told you
to stay in the woods, Baz.

55
00:14:28,098 --> 00:14:32,186
What sort of a man hides in a hedge
while his friend is facing death?

56
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:49,120
This lot are carting off
half the world's antiquities.

57
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:52,331
I was gonna stop 'em,
but now I've gotta rescue you.

58
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:54,416
Did you at least find the Lance?

59
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:56,669
-"At least"?
-Well, have you got it?

60
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:58,003
It's a fake.

61
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,004
What?

62
00:14:59,713 --> 00:15:01,006
A reproduction.

63
00:15:09,223 --> 00:15:10,099
Indy?

64
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,443
The Antikythera.

65
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,279
Archimedes' Dial.

66
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:25,823
Bring it.

67
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:44,675
Hurry up, Baz.

68
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:48,971
Give me that.

69
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:50,264
Come on.

70
00:16:04,904 --> 00:16:06,489
Get up, Baz.

71
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,865
Follow me.

72
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:09,825
Towards the gun?

73
00:16:09,992 --> 00:16:11,285
Away from the Nazis!

74
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:13,662
Those are Nazis!

75
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:16,207
Get down! Down! Down!

76
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:06,631
This way. Come on!

77
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:08,217
I can't do that!

78
00:17:08,384 --> 00:17:10,302
You wanna stop for a little lie-down?

79
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:17,892
Easy.

80
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:49,800
Tunnel!

81
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:02,146
Got you! No!

82
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:43,813
Indy!

83
00:18:51,987 --> 00:18:53,072
Get the gun!

84
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:03,666
Shoot him!

85
00:19:06,585 --> 00:19:07,670
Not me!

86
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:09,797
Sorry.

87
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:31,110
To the victor go the spoils.

88
00:20:19,158 --> 00:20:20,576
Indy!

89
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:32,379
Hey!

90
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:37,802
-Here!
-They can't hear you, Baz.

91
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:39,720
We gotta jump!

92
00:20:39,887 --> 00:20:41,222
What about my dicky knee?

93
00:20:48,187 --> 00:20:49,188
Baz!

94
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:51,107
Baz!

95
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:53,984
Baz!

96
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,987
-Indy!
-Baz!

97
00:21:02,284 --> 00:21:03,786
Go! Move! Move it!

98
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:08,415
Bit rum to go home empty-handed
after all that.

99
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:10,209
"Empty-handed"?

100
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:11,752
Not exactly.

101
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:15,631
Archimedes' Dial.

102
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:16,841
Well, half of it.

103
00:21:17,007 --> 00:21:19,218
Come on, Baz. Let's get home.

104
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:27,203
Larry! Turn it down!

105
00:22:28,245 --> 00:22:29,497
Turn it down!

106
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:31,499
Hey, Larry!

107
00:22:46,222 --> 00:22:47,223
Larry!

108
00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:49,600
Larry!

109
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:51,352
-Hi, Mr. Jones.
-Where's Larry?

110
00:22:52,686 --> 00:22:53,395
Who is this guy?

111
00:22:53,562 --> 00:22:54,688
It's the old guy next door.

112
00:22:54,855 --> 00:22:56,482
Larry, it's 8:00 in the morning.

113
00:22:56,649 --> 00:22:59,026
-"It's 8:00 in the morning."
-We talked about this, Larry.

114
00:22:59,193 --> 00:23:00,152
Yeah, but that was...

115
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,780
-a workday, Mr. Jones.
-This is a workday too, Larry!

116
00:23:04,156 --> 00:23:05,324
Turn on the news.

117
00:23:05,491 --> 00:23:06,867
It's moon day, Mr. Jones.

118
00:23:07,993 --> 00:23:09,203
Moon day?

119
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,424
Thanks.

120
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:18,856
All you really need to remember...

121
00:24:19,023 --> 00:24:22,610
is that Assyrian ceramics of this period
are characterized...

122
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:26,739
by this complex blue-line pattern.

123
00:24:26,906 --> 00:24:27,907
Okay?

124
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:32,369
I assigned pages 131 through 171...

125
00:24:32,536 --> 00:24:34,163
in Winford for today.

126
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,831
Anybody do the reading?

127
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:39,126
Anyone?

128
00:24:41,921 --> 00:24:43,964
Gosh, this is on the test.

129
00:24:44,131 --> 00:24:45,341
Okay.

130
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,552
Guess I'll spoon-feed it to you.

131
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,058
In 213 BC...

132
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:56,227
Roman forces led by Marcellus...

133
00:24:56,393 --> 00:24:59,230
laid siege to the city of Syracuse.

134
00:24:59,396 --> 00:25:01,065
"Syracuse."

135
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:05,111
Not the Syracuse in New York, Tonya.

136
00:25:05,277 --> 00:25:06,862
The one in Sicily.

137
00:25:07,655 --> 00:25:10,032
Amongst the defenders of the city...

138
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:13,285
was its most famous resident, who was...

139
00:25:15,496 --> 00:25:17,206
Come on, guys. This is on the final.

140
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:19,500
Archimedes.

141
00:25:20,376 --> 00:25:21,418
Archimedes.

142
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:22,920
Archimedes, who was a...

143
00:25:23,087 --> 00:25:24,213
A mathematician.

144
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,548
A mathematician.

145
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:28,300
But more than that, an inventor...

146
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:30,970
a brilliant engineer...

147
00:25:31,137 --> 00:25:35,474
who conceived of a way to harness the energy
of the Mediterranean sun...

148
00:25:35,641 --> 00:25:38,352
on concave mirrors and focus it...

149
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,188
on attacking Roman warships
and set them on fire.

150
00:25:41,355 --> 00:25:44,817
Who devised giant iron claws...

151
00:25:44,984 --> 00:25:47,570
that could snatch hostiles from the sea.

152
00:25:50,156 --> 00:25:53,033
But how do we know it really happened?

153
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,164
What physical, irrefutable
archeological evidence...

154
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,667
-is there of these inventions?
-The Antikythera.

155
00:26:03,043 --> 00:26:05,212
-The Antikythera.
-For starters.

156
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:07,381
They're here! They're downtown!

157
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:10,676
The astronauts.

158
00:26:10,843 --> 00:26:13,179
<i>Giant parade this morning will be seen...</i>

159
00:26:13,345 --> 00:26:16,474
<i>by about two and a half million people
lining the sidewalks...</i>

160
00:26:19,518 --> 00:26:20,936
He's coming. He's come. See?

161
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:22,521
Oh, here he comes.

162
00:26:23,564 --> 00:26:24,482
Hide the cake.

163
00:26:26,192 --> 00:26:28,277
-Surprise.
-Surprise!

164
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:33,574
For over a decade now...

165
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:38,245
our colleague Dr. Jones has been
a loyal servant of Hunter.

166
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:41,248
A token of our gratitude.

167
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:49,507
Wow.

168
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:55,846
Thanks for putting up with me.

169
00:27:10,236 --> 00:27:11,070
Here.

170
00:27:19,787 --> 00:27:22,832
<i>Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins,
and Buzz Aldrin...</i>

171
00:27:22,998 --> 00:27:24,959
<i>will not be able to avoid the spotlight.</i>

172
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:28,838
<i>At 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time,
a grateful nation will pay homage...</i>

173
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:31,632
<i>with a ticker-tape parade
through New York and Chicago...</i>

174
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,300
<i>climaxed by a dinner in Los Angeles...</i>

175
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:34,802
What would the ancients say?

176
00:27:35,261 --> 00:27:37,054
<i>Neil, Buzz, and Mike...</i>

177
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:39,974
If they knew we walked on the moon?

178
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:41,684
Speaking as an ancient...

179
00:27:41,851 --> 00:27:44,311
going to the moon is like going to Reno.

180
00:27:44,478 --> 00:27:45,771
Middle of nowhere...

181
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:48,441
and no blackjack.

182
00:27:49,483 --> 00:27:51,110
You don't recognize me, do you?

183
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:55,489
Whatever I did, I apologize.

184
00:27:56,449 --> 00:27:57,491
It's Helena.

185
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:00,119
Helena Shaw.

186
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:03,164
Wombat?

187
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,999
Wow, I haven't heard that in a while.

188
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:07,251
-You got tall.
-I did.

189
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:08,711
It's fair to say.

190
00:28:10,838 --> 00:28:11,922
I'm celebrating.

191
00:28:13,048 --> 00:28:15,259
-I'm retiring.
-Oh.

192
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,261
Wow.
Well, in that case, what are we drinking?

193
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:24,435
Room service for Mr. Schmidt.

194
00:28:36,947 --> 00:28:37,907
Put that away.

195
00:28:38,073 --> 00:28:39,909
I was asking how you broke your ankle.

196
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:41,619
None of your business.

197
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:42,703
Are you Mr. Schmidt?

198
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,997
"Doctor" Schmidt. He's in there.

199
00:28:45,164 --> 00:28:47,958
And he don't eat anything on wheels,
so put it on a table.

200
00:28:49,418 --> 00:28:50,711
<i>When I was a little boy...</i>

201
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:52,379
<i>I always imagined...</i>

202
00:28:52,546 --> 00:28:56,258
<i>that one day man would walk on the moon.</i>

203
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:57,927
<i>And by golly...</i>

204
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:06,268
Quite a celebration out there.

205
00:29:09,688 --> 00:29:11,148
The man you're servin'...

206
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:13,609
he's the one who put those astronauts
on the moon.

207
00:29:13,776 --> 00:29:14,819
Built the rockets they rode in.

208
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:17,488
Congratulations.

209
00:29:17,947 --> 00:29:18,781
Where are you from?

210
00:29:19,865 --> 00:29:20,658
The Bronx, sir.

211
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,785
No, no. I mean originally, your people.

212
00:29:22,952 --> 00:29:23,953
Do you know?

213
00:29:28,582 --> 00:29:30,292
I was born by Yankee Stadium, sir.

214
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:34,713
And you fought for your country?

215
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,091
320th Battalion.

216
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:39,635
Set up balloons to stop the planes
bombing Normandy.

217
00:29:45,141 --> 00:29:46,976
And are you enjoying your victory?

218
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:55,860
Will there be anything else?

219
00:29:58,404 --> 00:29:59,613
You didn't win the war.

220
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:02,408
Hitler lost it.

221
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:08,873
Yeah.

222
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:12,835
My field agent, she found Shaw.

223
00:30:13,836 --> 00:30:15,045
Yeah, I'm comin'.

224
00:30:15,212 --> 00:30:16,213
Let's go, Hauke.

225
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,801
Where are we here?

226
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,804
Oxford. In the garden.

227
00:30:25,681 --> 00:30:26,974
He was an original.

228
00:30:29,393 --> 00:30:30,811
I just graduated.

229
00:30:30,978 --> 00:30:31,979
In Archeology.

230
00:30:32,938 --> 00:30:35,065
Archeology. Wow.

231
00:30:35,232 --> 00:30:36,776
Apple didn't fall far.

232
00:30:36,942 --> 00:30:39,653
Well, now I'm researching a doctorate.

233
00:30:40,863 --> 00:30:41,864
What's your subject?

234
00:30:42,656 --> 00:30:44,658
The Archimedes Dial.

235
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:46,744
The Antikythera.

236
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:51,040
What do you know about that?

237
00:30:51,582 --> 00:30:52,917
Well, for starters...

238
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:56,462
in 1902, Greek sponge divers found
a wrecked Roman warship...

239
00:30:56,629 --> 00:30:58,005
huge, off the coast of Greece.

240
00:30:58,631 --> 00:31:00,341
Below deck, sealed in wax...

241
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:02,051
was a clock-like mechanism...

242
00:31:02,218 --> 00:31:05,012
finely tooled, purpose unknown.

243
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:09,141
Nothing approximating its complexity appears
in the world for 1,000 years.

244
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:12,436
-You've done your homework.
-Well, not me.

245
00:31:12,603 --> 00:31:15,606
Dad. He had all these journals,
reams of notes about it.

246
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:17,608
He was obsessed till the end.

247
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:23,447
He told me you found it
on a Nazi plunder train.

248
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:27,993
And then lost it in a river
in the French Alps.

249
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:31,956
Well, that was a long time ago.

250
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,582
And it was only half the Dial.

251
00:31:33,749 --> 00:31:35,292
-Archimedes...
-Archimedes broke the Dial in two...

252
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:36,418
-...disassembled it.
-...and then hid...

253
00:31:36,585 --> 00:31:38,587
the two halves from the Romans
during the siege of Syracuse.

254
00:31:38,754 --> 00:31:39,964
I know. Look.

255
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,967
You don't remember the last time I saw you,
do you?

256
00:31:44,593 --> 00:31:45,719
Remember what?

257
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:46,804
These are the Alps.

258
00:31:48,264 --> 00:31:49,849
Yeah, I see.

259
00:31:50,015 --> 00:31:51,851
And this is the route that your train took...

260
00:31:52,017 --> 00:31:53,978
-from the Nazi stronghold in '44.
-Right.

261
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,938
It went through this mountain pass...

262
00:31:56,105 --> 00:31:57,606
and then here.

263
00:31:57,773 --> 00:31:59,984
-Here, it's the only river on the route.
-Right.

264
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,235
Under a bridge.

265
00:32:01,402 --> 00:32:02,778
It's down there. It's got to be.

266
00:32:02,945 --> 00:32:05,364
-And nobody knows except us.
-"Us"?

267
00:32:05,656 --> 00:32:07,158
Well, I mean, you.

268
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:08,868
And me. So, yeah.

269
00:32:09,034 --> 00:32:10,870
-Us.
-Us.

270
00:32:11,871 --> 00:32:14,373
And what were you thinking exactly?

271
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:16,917
Well, that maybe...

272
00:32:18,752 --> 00:32:20,296
we could go there.

273
00:32:20,463 --> 00:32:21,505
And?

274
00:32:21,672 --> 00:32:22,756
And find it.

275
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:25,301
And I'd become...

276
00:32:26,927 --> 00:32:28,095
famous.

277
00:32:28,262 --> 00:32:29,555
Oh, well, not famous.

278
00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:30,556
Renowned. Feted.

279
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,933
A feted archeologist.

280
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,852
And you, a final triumph!

281
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:35,936
Indiana Jones!

282
00:32:36,103 --> 00:32:38,147
Out with a bang! Back in the saddle!

283
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,610
I'm not selling this, am I?

284
00:32:45,112 --> 00:32:46,322
Wombat...

285
00:32:48,449 --> 00:32:50,284
why are you chasing the thing...

286
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,121
that drove your father crazy?

287
00:33:00,085 --> 00:33:01,504
Wouldn't you?

288
00:33:19,855 --> 00:33:20,689
I got it.

289
00:33:20,856 --> 00:33:21,816
Parade's comin' soon.

290
00:33:23,025 --> 00:33:23,859
So, what we got?

291
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:27,988
She's in there, third floor, with an old guy.

292
00:33:28,155 --> 00:33:29,281
Who is he, a Russian?

293
00:33:29,448 --> 00:33:31,367
No, a professor. Dr. Henry Jones.

294
00:33:32,618 --> 00:33:33,452
Klaber!

295
00:33:33,953 --> 00:33:36,038
Klaber, get back here! You're not an agent!

296
00:33:36,205 --> 00:33:37,498
Goddammit!
Go.

297
00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:40,251
I'll get support up here
and pull a file on Jones.

298
00:34:00,896 --> 00:34:02,148
This way.

299
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:41,395
Basil became obsessed by this German theory.

300
00:34:42,938 --> 00:34:44,315
Conjecture, really.

301
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:49,153
Archimedes had figured out...

302
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:51,572
that the movements of the moon and planets...

303
00:34:52,448 --> 00:34:53,657
weren't perfect.

304
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:57,411
There were irregularities in their rotations.

305
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:00,873
He thought these irregularities might...

306
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,418
explain fluctuations in temperature, tides.

307
00:35:06,545 --> 00:35:07,838
Storms, even.

308
00:35:09,215 --> 00:35:12,092
So, he set about building a device
to predict them.

309
00:35:13,803 --> 00:35:17,723
But then, he stumbled upon a method
to predict even larger...

310
00:35:18,474 --> 00:35:19,475
disturbances.

311
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:22,770
Larger disturbances?

312
00:35:23,395 --> 00:35:25,606
Your father thought this thing could...

313
00:35:26,315 --> 00:35:28,567
predict fissures in time.

314
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:47,086
Hauke, if you don't...

315
00:35:49,505 --> 00:35:50,589
Found 'em.

316
00:35:59,265 --> 00:36:00,182
Hello.

317
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,602
Are you looking for...

318
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:04,937
Dr. Jones?

319
00:36:08,607 --> 00:36:09,859
Excuse me, can I help you?

320
00:36:10,484 --> 00:36:11,360
No, thank you.

321
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:13,237
Just a routine investigation, ma'am.

322
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:16,824
Are you the police?

323
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:18,325
It'll just be a few moments.

324
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:20,327
-Professor Plimpton.
-Ma'am.

325
00:36:20,494 --> 00:36:21,620
-Professor Plimpton!
-Ma'am!

326
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:27,001
Drop your weapon.

327
00:36:27,376 --> 00:36:28,377
What the hell are you doin'?

328
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,755
What the doctor tells me, Miss Mason.

329
00:36:31,922 --> 00:36:32,798
Mandy?

330
00:36:37,553 --> 00:36:39,597
Yeah, no witnesses.

331
00:36:43,976 --> 00:36:46,061
Jesus. What the hell?

332
00:36:46,353 --> 00:36:49,648
Your father wrote so many letters
about the Dial, I stopped reading 'em.

333
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,488
You really don't remember the last time
I was at your house?

334
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,325
I took that from him then.

335
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:02,661
I thought he'd stopped thinking about it.

336
00:37:02,828 --> 00:37:06,707
But your father was convinced this thing
was real and dangerous.

337
00:37:06,874 --> 00:37:08,834
Do not shoot.

338
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:12,671
He was terrified that if somebody found
this legendary tablet,

339
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:13,964
the Grafikos...

340
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,300
The tablet containing directions
to the rest of the Dial.

341
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,593
And if they found the Grafikos...

342
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,303
they might acquire the other half
of the Dial...

343
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,304
and put the two together.

344
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:23,182
I knew you wouldn't destroy it.

345
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,646
How did you know he asked me to destroy it?

346
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:29,980
What?

347
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,524
You do remember that night.

348
00:37:32,942 --> 00:37:35,694
-I was 12 years old, Indy.
-You knew we didn't drop it in a river.

349
00:37:36,529 --> 00:37:37,613
Baz didn't tell you that.

350
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,782
-See, listen. I didn't...
-No, he never lied.

351
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,701
-No. You...
-What was all that crap about the map?

352
00:37:42,868 --> 00:37:43,911
No, you've had too many whiskeys.

353
00:37:44,787 --> 00:37:45,704
What are you doing, Wombat?

354
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:47,039
Stay where you are.

355
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:49,416
Don't move.

356
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,627
-Who are these people?
-We need to get out of here.

357
00:37:51,794 --> 00:37:52,628
Are they with you?

358
00:37:52,795 --> 00:37:53,963
Not an inch, Miss Shaw.

359
00:37:55,297 --> 00:37:56,298
Miss Shaw, stop!

360
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:00,511
Helena!

361
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:06,767
Stop!

362
00:38:08,727 --> 00:38:09,770
Sorry.

363
00:38:09,937 --> 00:38:10,729
Helena!

364
00:38:10,896 --> 00:38:12,773
Dr. Jones. It's over.

365
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,150
Who are you people?

366
00:38:14,316 --> 00:38:15,401
What do you want?

367
00:38:17,403 --> 00:38:18,237
Stop!

368
00:38:20,406 --> 00:38:21,240
Helena Shaw!

369
00:38:21,407 --> 00:38:22,658
She's on the roof. Find another way up.

370
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:23,659
Dr. Jones!

371
00:38:24,493 --> 00:38:25,870
Dr. Jones, we're not gonna hurt you.

372
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,899
-Move. We gotta follow 'em.
-Go. Hurry up.

373
00:39:22,468 --> 00:39:23,302
Fan out!

374
00:39:36,482 --> 00:39:38,859
-All right, let's go. Move, move, move! Pack it up!
-Come on. Get everything.

375
00:39:39,026 --> 00:39:40,152
Found her!

376
00:40:08,597 --> 00:40:10,891
<i>-Operator.
</i>-I need the police.

377
00:40:11,058 --> 00:40:13,352
Hunter College. People are dead.

378
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,603
-Please...
-Hang up, fella.

379
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:21,402
Stand up.

380
00:40:27,032 --> 00:40:27,992
Okay, okay.

381
00:40:52,475 --> 00:40:53,934
She's gone. You blew it...

382
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:55,352
you trigger-happy cracker.

383
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,980
-She had it in her hand.
-We got the professor.

384
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:02,735
Here's the file on Jones.

385
00:41:02,902 --> 00:41:03,819
Yes.

386
00:41:22,087 --> 00:41:23,130
Who are you?

387
00:41:23,297 --> 00:41:24,757
That's my question.

388
00:41:35,267 --> 00:41:36,727
You're CIA.

389
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,646
Oh, not me, man.

390
00:41:38,813 --> 00:41:40,773
I don't take government jobs.

391
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,774
Okay.

392
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:45,486
How are you acquainted with Miss Shaw?

393
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:47,113
She's my goddaughter.

394
00:41:47,863 --> 00:41:49,490
I haven't seen her in 18 years.

395
00:41:49,657 --> 00:41:51,826
Why did you meet with her today?
To give her the Dial?

396
00:41:53,202 --> 00:41:55,663
Lady, it's an ancient hunk of gears.

397
00:41:56,622 --> 00:41:57,581
Half a hunk.

398
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,458
Oh, it's a lot more than that.

399
00:42:01,168 --> 00:42:02,253
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

400
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:03,671
Where do you think you're going?

401
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:05,214
I got a parade going on.

402
00:42:05,381 --> 00:42:06,841
And a demonstration coming down here.

403
00:42:07,007 --> 00:42:08,050
Hey! Hey, hey!

404
00:42:08,717 --> 00:42:09,760
-Hey...
-Shut up.

405
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:12,346
I can't go this way. Gotta go back.

406
00:42:17,351 --> 00:42:19,103
Hell no! What is wrong with you, man?

407
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,896
Damn it!
Let's go on foot.

408
00:42:21,063 --> 00:42:21,897
You heard her.

409
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:24,817
What the hell were you thinking?

410
00:42:24,984 --> 00:42:26,277
-Walk! Come on.
-What is your problem?

411
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:27,945
-You don't look when you're backin' up?
-Take care of that guy.

412
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:28,904
Who's gonna pay for that?

413
00:42:29,071 --> 00:42:30,239
Easy, fella. Easy.

414
00:42:30,406 --> 00:42:31,157
Keep movin'.

415
00:42:31,323 --> 00:42:33,033
Can't you see my cab? It's yellow.

416
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,202
No, you're gonna have to pay
for this bodywork, man. I don't...

417
00:42:37,746 --> 00:42:40,040
Peace now! Peace now!

418
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:44,295
Stop the war! Stop the fighting!

419
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:46,213
-Where are we going, Mason?
-This way.

420
00:42:48,257 --> 00:42:49,842
-Hell no, we won't go.
-Shut up.

421
00:42:50,009 --> 00:42:51,427
-Hell no, we won't go!
-Hell no!

422
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,346
-Hell no, we won't go!
<i>-</i>Hell no, we won't go!

423
00:42:54,513 --> 00:42:55,389
We won't go!

424
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:57,933
-Hell no, we won't go!
<i>-</i>Hell no, we won't go!

425
00:42:58,517 --> 00:42:59,935
-Hell no...
-Shut up!

426
00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:01,103
Hell yeah!

427
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,156
Hell no...

428
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:23,918
Hey!

429
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,837
Officer! Help me!

430
00:43:27,588 --> 00:43:29,089
Officer, there was a shooting...

431
00:43:29,256 --> 00:43:31,091
-All right, all right.
-...this morning at Hunter.

432
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:33,010
People are dead. God damn it.

433
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:36,514
-Some rogue maniacs broke in and...
-Sir, you need to calm it down.

434
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,890
Please listen to me.

435
00:43:38,057 --> 00:43:40,184
There was a shooting this morning, and the...

436
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,771
They're in a Con Ed van
right around the corner!

437
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,983
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

438
00:44:00,162 --> 00:44:01,497
-Watch out!
-What's he doin'?

439
00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:23,394
You did it!

440
00:44:50,713 --> 00:44:51,714
Move, out the way!

441
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:00,723
Watch out!

442
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:04,226
Move! Quickly!

443
00:45:18,991 --> 00:45:19,909
Move! Move!

444
00:45:30,503 --> 00:45:31,879
Go, go, go!

445
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:55,152
Come on. That's ridiculous. It's a horse.

446
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,153
Come on!

447
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:00,491
-Hey, mister.
-Move! Out of the way!

448
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:01,659
Hold my horse.

449
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:02,952
Move! Move!

450
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,830
<i>Transfer is available
for IND Queens Boulevard.</i>

451
00:46:15,297 --> 00:46:18,300
<i>Next stop, 59th, Lexington Avenue.</i>

452
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,428
Subway is faster.

453
00:46:22,972 --> 00:46:26,767
People tend to romanticize science,
when it is, in fact, quite cold.

454
00:46:26,934 --> 00:46:28,436
So, what's next, Dr. Schmidt?

455
00:46:29,562 --> 00:46:30,479
Mars?

456
00:46:31,439 --> 00:46:32,857
No, we've conquered space.

457
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:36,402
I'm moving to the next frontier.

458
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:40,281
What's beyond space?

459
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:46,912
You might wanna get that suit pressed,
Dr. Schmidt.

460
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:49,165
We leave for the airport in an hour.

461
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,624
He's gonna meet the President.

462
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:52,293
If the President objects to a few creases...

463
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,712
perhaps he should find himself
another physicist.

464
00:46:55,713 --> 00:46:57,548
-Can I use that?
-No.

465
00:46:57,923 --> 00:46:58,757
Yes.

466
00:47:00,509 --> 00:47:01,343
Baxter.

467
00:47:05,306 --> 00:47:06,432
It's for you, Doctor.

468
00:47:10,186 --> 00:47:12,229
I may wanna leave a bit later
for Los Angeles.

469
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,648
I'm expecting a delivery shortly.

470
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:18,736
Speak.

471
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:20,404
<i>Your goons made a mess.</i>

472
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:21,739
<i>Did they?</i>

473
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:24,325
Miss Shaw met with a professor. Jones.

474
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,702
She acquired the device from him.

475
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,704
<i>Then we lost her.</i>

476
00:47:30,372 --> 00:47:32,041
<i>Dr. Jones got away as well.</i>

477
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:33,626
<i>Is that so?</i>

478
00:47:33,793 --> 00:47:35,127
<i>Most unfortunate.</i>

479
00:47:35,503 --> 00:47:37,087
I gotta clean things up here, Doctor.

480
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,507
<i>And as a representative
of the United States government...</i>

481
00:47:39,673 --> 00:47:41,383
<i>I urge you to cooperate.</i>

482
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:42,760
<i>Get on that plane to Los Angeles...</i>

483
00:47:43,677 --> 00:47:44,929
and get your medal from the President.

484
00:47:52,561 --> 00:47:53,395
Hello?

485
00:47:54,146 --> 00:47:56,315
Call our friends
and secure a private charter.

486
00:47:57,733 --> 00:47:58,651
To Morocco.

487
00:47:58,818 --> 00:47:59,985
Yes, sir.

488
00:48:00,903 --> 00:48:04,115
<i>The university murders took place
at the height of the parade.</i>

489
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:07,701
<i>Police are searching for retired professor
Dr. Henry Jones.</i>

490
00:48:07,868 --> 00:48:10,871
<i>A colleague told ABC
that Jones recently lost his son...</i>

491
00:48:11,038 --> 00:48:13,040
<i>and was in the middle of a divorce.</i>

492
00:48:15,751 --> 00:48:18,462
This guy, he looks like you.

493
00:48:19,421 --> 00:48:21,799
Nah. No.

494
00:48:23,759 --> 00:48:24,760
It is you.

495
00:48:24,927 --> 00:48:25,761
No, no, no. Hey.

496
00:48:25,928 --> 00:48:27,429
-Go home, pal. You're drunk.
-This is the guy!

497
00:48:27,596 --> 00:48:28,889
-Hey!
-It's the killer!

498
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:32,977
Sorry I'm late, Indy.

499
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:34,562
Bridge traffic.

500
00:48:45,448 --> 00:48:47,616
Boy, am I glad to see you, Sallah.

501
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:50,453
I wish I could say the same, old friend.

502
00:48:53,747 --> 00:48:55,666
Quickly, Indy. Inside.

503
00:48:59,462 --> 00:49:01,755
{\an8}Your goddaughter, Helena...

504
00:49:01,922 --> 00:49:04,592
was arrested in Tangier last year...

505
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,511
for auctioning contraband.

506
00:49:09,972 --> 00:49:10,931
There's more.

507
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:15,519
She was bailed out by Aziz Rahim.

508
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,106
Aziz Rahim is the son of Big Rahim...

509
00:49:19,273 --> 00:49:22,026
a well-known Moroccan mobster.

510
00:49:23,569 --> 00:49:27,239
Big Rahim owns the Hotel Atlantique...

511
00:49:27,406 --> 00:49:29,992
in Tangier, and this week...

512
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:34,288
the hotel is hosting its annual auction...

513
00:49:34,455 --> 00:49:36,332
of stolen antiquities.

514
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,002
All the big players are already there.

515
00:49:40,169 --> 00:49:41,962
Alia, Jabari.

516
00:49:42,129 --> 00:49:46,300
This is the great man who brought our family
to America during the war.

517
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,844
Quick, when was the Suez Crisis?

518
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,388
1956.

519
00:49:51,847 --> 00:49:53,224
Very impressive, Jabari.

520
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,810
My grandchildren watch too much TV...

521
00:49:55,976 --> 00:49:58,521
but they know their history.

522
00:49:58,687 --> 00:50:02,817
They understand what it is
to be American and Egyptian.

523
00:50:03,692 --> 00:50:05,861
I need a ride to the airport, Sallah.

524
00:50:06,946 --> 00:50:09,448
If you run, the police will assume
that you're guilty.

525
00:50:10,157 --> 00:50:13,494
Without Helena or the Dial,
I'm gonna get framed for murder.

526
00:50:14,662 --> 00:50:16,288
Have you thought about calling Marion?

527
00:50:17,373 --> 00:50:18,707
She doesn't wanna talk to me.

528
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,467
<i>Welcome to New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport.</i>

529
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:31,595
<i>The upper level is for Pan American Airlines
passenger drop off only.</i>

530
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,597
I took something else from your apartment.

531
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:34,974
It was under the bed.

532
00:50:40,187 --> 00:50:41,230
Thanks, Sallah.

533
00:50:43,482 --> 00:50:45,276
I also brought my passport.

534
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:48,529
I could help you.

535
00:50:48,696 --> 00:50:49,613
In Tangier?

536
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,407
Wherever chance takes us.

537
00:50:52,324 --> 00:50:53,409
Indy, I...

538
00:50:54,326 --> 00:50:55,786
I miss the desert.

539
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:57,663
I miss the sea.

540
00:50:59,206 --> 00:51:01,000
And I miss waking up every morning...

541
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:04,295
wondering what wonderful adventure
the new day will bring to us.

542
00:51:05,254 --> 00:51:07,256
This is not an adventure, Sallah.

543
00:51:08,716 --> 00:51:11,302
Those days have come and gone.

544
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:12,511
Perhaps.

545
00:51:12,678 --> 00:51:14,013
Perhaps not.

546
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:21,103
Give 'em hell, Indiana Jones!

547
00:51:32,698 --> 00:51:33,574
Champagne?

548
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:36,035
We've got four more hours to Tangier.

549
00:51:43,793 --> 00:51:45,211
Your scotch, sir.

550
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:46,837
Thanks.

551
00:51:53,761 --> 00:51:55,137
<i>Basil. Come on, Baz!</i>

552
00:51:55,304 --> 00:51:57,056
<i>-Open the door!
-No!</i>

553
00:51:57,223 --> 00:51:58,724
<i>-Stay out, Indy!
</i>-Open the door.

554
00:52:01,936 --> 00:52:03,813
The Germans were right, Indy.

555
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,273
-What?
-It's too big. It's too much.

556
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,274
Hey, Ba...
Hey, hey!

557
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:09,235
-Hey, Baz! Give me...
-No.

558
00:52:09,401 --> 00:52:11,487
-What are you doing?
-You've listened to nothing that I said.

559
00:52:11,654 --> 00:52:13,447
I don't understand it, Baz!

560
00:52:13,781 --> 00:52:15,741
Well, I was trying to explain it
to you downstairs.

561
00:52:15,908 --> 00:52:18,202
-You've just ignored everything.
-You're terrifying your daughter.

562
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:22,456
Indy, Archimedes...

563
00:52:22,623 --> 00:52:24,834
discovered a temporal meteorology.

564
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:27,670
Archimedes was a mathematician, Baz...

565
00:52:27,837 --> 00:52:29,046
not a magician.

566
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:31,674
He could predict fissures in time.

567
00:52:31,841 --> 00:52:33,384
Fissures in time?

568
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:36,804
-Baz, you can't prove that!
-Well, not yet.

569
00:52:36,971 --> 00:52:38,848
Proving it is what makes it science!

570
00:52:54,113 --> 00:52:55,322
Oh, Baz.

571
00:52:57,032 --> 00:52:58,576
I never should've given you the thing.

572
00:52:59,285 --> 00:53:00,786
It belongs in a museum.

573
00:53:01,704 --> 00:53:03,414
Give it to me. Please.

574
00:53:07,001 --> 00:53:08,377
If I give you this...

575
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:11,046
it must be destroyed.

576
00:53:12,548 --> 00:53:13,424
I will.

577
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,678
I'll destroy it, Baz.

578
00:53:20,181 --> 00:53:21,182
Promise.

579
00:53:27,313 --> 00:53:28,814
I'm sorry about this.

580
00:53:28,981 --> 00:53:30,191
It's all my fault.

581
00:53:32,401 --> 00:53:33,778
-Are you gonna be here?
-Yes, sir.

582
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:36,030
Okay. I've gotta catch an airplane.

583
00:53:36,197 --> 00:53:38,991
If anyone finds the Grafikos,
they'll have both halves.

584
00:53:39,158 --> 00:53:40,493
Some things should stay buried.

585
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:41,410
I know, Baz.

586
00:53:41,577 --> 00:53:43,370
-It's vital that you destroy it.
-I will, Baz.

587
00:53:43,537 --> 00:53:44,914
-Do you understand?
-I'll destroy it.

588
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:45,831
-Say you will, Indy.
-Yes.

589
00:53:45,998 --> 00:53:46,999
I will... Yes.

590
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:48,751
You promised me. Remember that.

591
00:53:48,918 --> 00:53:49,919
I will... I promise.

592
00:53:50,085 --> 00:53:50,961
There's a reason...

593
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:53,714
a reason that Archimedes broke it in two.

594
00:53:53,881 --> 00:53:55,591
I know, Baz.

595
00:53:55,758 --> 00:53:56,634
Indy.

596
00:53:58,636 --> 00:53:59,929
Thanks, Wombat.

597
00:54:00,095 --> 00:54:02,056
He's gonna be all right in a few days.

598
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:05,559
I'll call you as soon as I land.

599
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:11,899
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

600
00:54:12,066 --> 00:54:14,527
<i>we are 20 minutes from landing in Tangier.</i>

601
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:49,687
-Stop drinking!
-What are you doing?

602
00:54:49,854 --> 00:54:51,439
No more champagne! How many more...

603
00:54:51,605 --> 00:54:52,481
I'm staying.

604
00:54:52,648 --> 00:54:54,108
Go home. Go home!

605
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:13,127
Miss Shaw, she's here.

606
00:55:17,381 --> 00:55:18,215
Forged in bronze.

607
00:55:18,632 --> 00:55:19,675
Nearly complete.

608
00:55:19,842 --> 00:55:21,469
It is an astrological clock.

609
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:24,263
Dating third century BC...

610
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:28,350
and built by Archimedes himself.

611
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:31,812
All right, let's start at 20,000.

612
00:55:31,979 --> 00:55:33,063
20,000, thank you very much.

613
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,565
30. 30.

614
00:55:34,732 --> 00:55:35,649
Gauges green...

615
00:55:36,192 --> 00:55:37,401
power full...

616
00:55:37,568 --> 00:55:39,904
and when I reach 85, I rotate.

617
00:55:40,529 --> 00:55:41,363
What next?

618
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:43,616
-Louis, help him! He's so cute.
-Pull back on the yoke.

619
00:55:43,783 --> 00:55:45,993
-I did, man. I'm airborne.
-Yeah, he's airborne.

620
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,369
-Can I have a sip?
-Do I pick up the flaps?

621
00:55:47,536 --> 00:55:49,538
Don't touch the flaps under 400 feet.

622
00:55:49,705 --> 00:55:51,373
Decrease your pitch to get to 120.

623
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,541
All right.

624
00:55:55,127 --> 00:55:57,379
-Private auction, old timer.
-I've gotta get in there.

625
00:55:57,546 --> 00:56:00,049
No password, no entry.
I don't make the rules.

626
00:56:02,885 --> 00:56:04,637
-And what is the current bid?
-The bid is 50,000.

627
00:56:04,804 --> 00:56:06,055
Then I bid 55.

628
00:56:07,014 --> 00:56:08,015
-Who'll give me 60?
-60.

629
00:56:08,182 --> 00:56:09,683
60. 65?

630
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:11,018
-65. 70?
-75.

631
00:56:11,185 --> 00:56:12,436
-75. 80?
-80.

632
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:14,230
-85.
-How about 90?

633
00:56:21,237 --> 00:56:22,071
This auction is private.

634
00:56:22,404 --> 00:56:23,489
This auction's over.

635
00:56:23,906 --> 00:56:25,199
<i>Au contraire</i>, it's hardly begun.

636
00:56:25,366 --> 00:56:26,784
-100.
-100,000.

637
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:28,494
I like the hat, by the way.

638
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:29,912
Makes you look at least two years younger.

639
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,163
Thanks.

640
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:32,915
-110, bravo.
-I told you that this auction is over.

641
00:56:33,082 --> 00:56:34,375
Excuse me, who is this man?

642
00:56:34,542 --> 00:56:35,918
-I'm her godfather.
-He's mildly related.

643
00:56:36,085 --> 00:56:38,003
And she's up past her bedtime.

644
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,380
-Come on, Wombat.
-I wouldn't do that.

645
00:56:39,547 --> 00:56:41,048
You want to explain it to the cops
at the bar?

646
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:42,550
The ones I paid off?

647
00:56:43,092 --> 00:56:44,677
You're out of your depth, Jonesy.

648
00:56:44,844 --> 00:56:46,178
-"Jonesy"?
-He thinks I'm a criminal.

649
00:56:46,345 --> 00:56:48,097
He's the one wanted for murder.

650
00:56:48,264 --> 00:56:50,307
Nice big picture in the <i>New York Herald. </i>130?

651
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:52,101
I didn't kill anyone.

652
00:56:52,268 --> 00:56:54,061
-No entry, it's a private auction.
-And you know it, Helena.

653
00:56:54,937 --> 00:56:58,107
But whoever did was looking for this.

654
00:56:58,774 --> 00:57:00,651
What you've got here is Pandora's Box.

655
00:57:01,902 --> 00:57:03,112
No, actually.

656
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:05,448
It's my box.

657
00:57:08,075 --> 00:57:09,076
You.

658
00:57:10,786 --> 00:57:11,912
Have we met?

659
00:57:12,246 --> 00:57:13,080
No.

660
00:57:13,247 --> 00:57:14,623
My memory is a little fuzzy...

661
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:16,500
but your face rings a bell.

662
00:57:17,126 --> 00:57:18,169
Are you still a Nazi?

663
00:57:22,256 --> 00:57:24,425
You're confused. My name is Schmidt.

664
00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:27,178
Professor Schmidt of Alabama University.

665
00:57:28,888 --> 00:57:29,805
Professor Schmidt.

666
00:57:30,264 --> 00:57:31,223
How nice to meet you in person.

667
00:57:32,308 --> 00:57:33,976
-150.
-After our conversation, Miss Shaw...

668
00:57:34,143 --> 00:57:36,103
I thought we'd come to an agreement
about the Dial.

669
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:38,481
Funny. The last time I saw the other guy
who looks like you...

670
00:57:38,647 --> 00:57:40,399
he was also after this.

671
00:57:40,983 --> 00:57:42,610
Your numbers were light, Professor Schmidt.

672
00:57:42,777 --> 00:57:43,861
But good news is, you're here now.

673
00:57:44,028 --> 00:57:46,489
-The bid is 160.
-You don't seem to understand, Miss Shaw.

674
00:57:46,655 --> 00:57:47,907
This relic is my property.

675
00:57:48,073 --> 00:57:49,575
It's not yours. You stole it.

676
00:57:49,742 --> 00:57:50,493
Then you stole it.

677
00:57:50,659 --> 00:57:52,244
And then I stole it.
It's called capitalism.

678
00:57:52,411 --> 00:57:53,287
The bid is 160.

679
00:57:53,454 --> 00:57:54,330
-160.
-170?

680
00:57:54,497 --> 00:57:55,456
You should've stayed in New York.

681
00:57:55,623 --> 00:57:57,500
-170?
-You should've stayed out of Poland.

682
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:59,502
170. Anyone? Anyone?

683
00:57:59,668 --> 00:58:00,961
Going, going...

684
00:58:01,504 --> 00:58:02,338
Gone!

685
00:58:02,963 --> 00:58:03,964
Stay away!

686
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:06,717
Get the Dial.

687
00:58:11,555 --> 00:58:12,389
Stay away!

688
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:22,608
Oh, hello, Claude.

689
00:58:22,775 --> 00:58:24,151
You should not have come back, Helena.

690
00:58:33,244 --> 00:58:34,537
Get back.

691
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:46,257
Teddy!

692
00:59:00,646 --> 00:59:01,772
Rahim says you stay.

693
00:59:13,742 --> 00:59:14,577
Thank you.

694
00:59:27,673 --> 00:59:29,133
See you in the past, Dr. Jones.

695
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:38,893
Move! Get out of the way!

696
00:59:56,202 --> 00:59:57,203
It's my cab!

697
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:03,918
Tell them to back off.

698
01:00:04,084 --> 01:00:05,461
I just told them to shoot you.

699
01:00:07,546 --> 01:00:08,756
All right, guys.

700
01:00:10,132 --> 01:00:11,509
Put the guns down.

701
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:12,885
Put 'em down.

702
01:00:15,012 --> 01:00:15,846
All right.

703
01:00:17,515 --> 01:00:18,849
That's better.

704
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:24,313
Oh, dear.

705
01:00:34,365 --> 01:00:35,491
Rahim.

706
01:00:36,575 --> 01:00:38,077
You're in pajamas.

707
01:00:38,577 --> 01:00:40,287
I was sleeping, Helena.

708
01:00:40,746 --> 01:00:41,664
Peacefully.

709
01:00:42,581 --> 01:00:44,416
Then my father woke me.

710
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:47,211
He told me you'd returned to our hotel.

711
01:00:48,712 --> 01:00:50,965
Then he handed me this scimitar...

712
01:00:51,132 --> 01:00:53,968
and told me to come home with your head.

713
01:00:55,803 --> 01:00:57,096
Does it have to be that bit?

714
01:01:04,854 --> 01:01:07,648
I thought maybe you returned
because you loved me.

715
01:01:07,815 --> 01:01:08,941
Rahim...

716
01:01:09,692 --> 01:01:11,277
I had an item to sell.

717
01:01:11,444 --> 01:01:13,320
Excuse me. The item she's talking about...

718
01:01:13,487 --> 01:01:15,114
-actually belongs to me.
-No. You do not need to...

719
01:01:15,281 --> 01:01:16,365
-And some very bad people...
-...intrude in this conversation.

720
01:01:16,532 --> 01:01:18,659
-...worse people, have run off with it.
-You do not need to get involved...

721
01:01:18,826 --> 01:01:19,743
-with my business.
-Is this your new man?

722
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:21,203
-No. No, no.
-It's complicated.

723
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:24,457
What exactly do you owe this guy?

724
01:01:24,623 --> 01:01:26,709
Just some bail money
and a lifetime of happiness.

725
01:01:26,876 --> 01:01:28,544
I presume you sold the ring.

726
01:01:28,711 --> 01:01:30,045
It didn't go for as much
as I thought it would.

727
01:01:30,504 --> 01:01:31,547
I'll do it!

728
01:01:31,714 --> 01:01:32,756
What are you... Hey!

729
01:01:39,054 --> 01:01:40,556
You just got me killed!

730
01:01:40,723 --> 01:01:43,309
Well, I'm not the one that's engaged
to a mobster!

731
01:01:43,476 --> 01:01:46,395
I don't need morality lessons
from an aging grave robber!

732
01:01:46,562 --> 01:01:47,772
I'm not a grave robber.

733
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:50,232
Your father and I
did important work together.

734
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:54,862
Don't tell me all your escapades were noble,
selfless quests.

735
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:55,905
You did it for the buzz!

736
01:01:58,616 --> 01:01:59,658
Oh, good work, Teddy!

737
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,870
-Move over, kid.
-Hey!

738
01:02:13,547 --> 01:02:15,424
-Helena!
-Back up! Back up!

739
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:34,026
Not this way!

740
01:02:34,193 --> 01:02:35,486
You don't know where you're going, Indy!

741
01:02:35,653 --> 01:02:37,488
-Listen to him. He knows this town!
-I know Tangier!

742
01:02:41,992 --> 01:02:43,035
There he is!

743
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:50,292
Faster. Go faster!

744
01:02:50,459 --> 01:02:52,419
Ten minutes to the airport, boss.

745
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:57,091
I'm not sure Professor Schmidt
is an actual professor, by the way.

746
01:02:57,258 --> 01:02:58,384
-He's a Nazi!
-Turn left!

747
01:02:58,551 --> 01:03:00,094
Turn left! Turn left!

748
01:03:00,261 --> 01:03:01,345
-Oh, no!
-No!

749
01:03:16,026 --> 01:03:17,987
Helena! Don't do this!

750
01:03:25,953 --> 01:03:27,496
-Hey, this way!
-That way!

751
01:03:28,456 --> 01:03:29,290
No!

752
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:31,917
Helena!

753
01:03:33,961 --> 01:03:34,962
No!

754
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,223
What the hell?

755
01:03:52,855 --> 01:03:54,106
Helena!

756
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:56,901
Hey!

757
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:57,943
Hey!

758
01:03:58,527 --> 01:03:59,528
What the hell?

759
01:04:02,823 --> 01:04:03,866
Come on!

760
01:04:07,661 --> 01:04:09,497
Come on. Come on!

761
01:04:43,364 --> 01:04:45,991
You think he'd be proud of this?

762
01:04:46,158 --> 01:04:47,076
Who?

763
01:04:48,828 --> 01:04:49,662
Your father!

764
01:04:49,829 --> 01:04:52,748
His only daughter selling her soul
for bail money!

765
01:04:52,915 --> 01:04:54,291
Sounds quite cool when you put it like that.

766
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:56,085
And it's not all bail money.

767
01:04:56,252 --> 01:04:58,546
-Some of it's gambling debt and some...
-Thank you, Teddy.

768
01:04:58,712 --> 01:05:00,422
Helena!
No!

769
01:05:00,589 --> 01:05:01,590
Helena!

770
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,177
How did you end up like this?

771
01:05:05,344 --> 01:05:06,679
Well, you mean resourceful?

772
01:05:06,846 --> 01:05:09,181
Daring? Beautiful? Self-sufficient?

773
01:05:34,498 --> 01:05:35,332
Hold on!

774
01:05:39,044 --> 01:05:40,045
Go this way!

775
01:05:49,597 --> 01:05:50,431
There he is.

776
01:06:03,152 --> 01:06:05,529
-Stop! Stop!
-Hey! Hey!

777
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,418
On the left!

778
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:21,545
Take the wheel, Teddy!

779
01:06:23,756 --> 01:06:24,799
What are you doing?

780
01:06:24,965 --> 01:06:26,509
Getting what's mine.

781
01:06:27,468 --> 01:06:28,469
Helena!

782
01:06:32,681 --> 01:06:34,225
Damn it! You crazy?

783
01:06:36,852 --> 01:06:38,771
Hey! Helena!

784
01:06:42,733 --> 01:06:44,360
-Take the gun!
-Miss Shaw.

785
01:06:45,778 --> 01:06:47,446
Let go, Miss Shaw!

786
01:07:10,302 --> 01:07:11,220
Let go.

787
01:07:11,387 --> 01:07:13,764
Come on! Give me the Dial!

788
01:07:15,266 --> 01:07:16,559
Helena!

789
01:07:18,477 --> 01:07:19,395
Damn.

790
01:07:26,193 --> 01:07:28,279
-Turn back! They went that way!
-He's gone!

791
01:07:28,446 --> 01:07:30,281
-Move over!
-Hey!

792
01:07:33,701 --> 01:07:36,745
I didn't come here to rescue you
from your fiancé!

793
01:07:36,912 --> 01:07:37,746
Rescue me?

794
01:07:42,918 --> 01:07:44,545
I just want the Dial back.

795
01:08:03,981 --> 01:08:05,483
Put your hands above your head.

796
01:08:06,734 --> 01:08:08,194
Not the smoothest break-up I ever had.

797
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,571
-If your father was still alive...
-Well, he's not, Indy.

798
01:08:10,738 --> 01:08:12,155
Hey, something's wrong with the engine.

799
01:08:12,323 --> 01:08:14,325
If only there'd been someone there for me,
some father figure...

800
01:08:14,492 --> 01:08:17,328
someone specifically anointed for the job.

801
01:08:17,495 --> 01:08:19,747
-You have no idea about the kind...
-Don't beat yourself up about it.

802
01:08:19,914 --> 01:08:21,999
I mean, what even is a godfather?

803
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:25,044
Anyway, family never was your strong suit.

804
01:08:25,711 --> 01:08:28,047
-What is the time, by the way?
-It's...

805
01:08:28,213 --> 01:08:29,215
Hey, no fair.

806
01:08:29,923 --> 01:08:30,883
Give me that back.

807
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:32,258
That was my father's watch!

808
01:08:34,803 --> 01:08:35,678
Give it back to him.

809
01:08:40,142 --> 01:08:41,560
You're gonna have to leave town with me.

810
01:08:41,727 --> 01:08:43,229
Rahim will be looking for you too.

811
01:08:43,395 --> 01:08:44,605
They'll go to Tangier airport first...

812
01:08:44,771 --> 01:08:46,941
so we'll need to catch a train
and get a plane from Casablanca.

813
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:50,026
What was that?

814
01:08:55,282 --> 01:08:56,117
Damn.

815
01:08:58,535 --> 01:08:59,620
Yeah.

816
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:00,663
I know, sir.

817
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:03,916
Yes...

818
01:09:05,292 --> 01:09:06,252
Copy.

819
01:09:11,382 --> 01:09:12,508
They pulled the plug.

820
01:09:12,758 --> 01:09:14,135
You got them scared.

821
01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:16,178
-Because they don't understand.
-No.

822
01:09:16,345 --> 01:09:18,763
Because your associates killed
three American civilians...

823
01:09:18,931 --> 01:09:21,182
and blew up a nationally televised parade.

824
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:24,311
Because you stood up
the President of the United States...

825
01:09:24,477 --> 01:09:25,646
ran to Morocco...

826
01:09:25,812 --> 01:09:28,190
and created an incident
that required military extraction!

827
01:09:30,316 --> 01:09:32,026
Then take me to DC,
and I will explain it all.

828
01:09:32,194 --> 01:09:33,529
They want you to vanish.

829
01:09:33,695 --> 01:09:35,823
We have half the Dial now.

830
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:37,324
They were just trying to keep you happy...

831
01:09:38,325 --> 01:09:39,994
letting you chase that thing.

832
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,370
They never cared about it.

833
01:09:41,537 --> 01:09:44,081
They will, Miss Mason,
when they understand what it can do.

834
01:09:44,248 --> 01:09:45,374
You put them on the moon.

835
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:47,334
They got what they wanted.

836
01:09:48,627 --> 01:09:50,546
All right, buckle up. We're landing in Spain.

837
01:09:51,172 --> 01:09:53,174
C-9 transport will take you
from there to Maxwell.

838
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:54,800
I'm not going back to Alabama!

839
01:09:54,967 --> 01:09:57,219
All we need is a vessel to take us
to the Mediterranean.

840
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,263
The Grafikos will take us to the other...

841
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:01,474
Please, Miss Mason. Please.

842
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:02,683
Let go of me, Schmidt.

843
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:04,477
I'm asking you personally.

844
01:10:05,394 --> 01:10:06,812
You're a piece of work, Doc.

845
01:10:08,522 --> 01:10:09,356
Hey!

846
01:10:37,384 --> 01:10:38,886
Schmidt...

847
01:10:39,804 --> 01:10:41,430
My name is Voller.

848
01:10:44,225 --> 01:10:45,601
Jürgen Voller.

849
01:10:58,864 --> 01:11:00,658
That's a Sea Stallion.

850
01:11:00,825 --> 01:11:02,243
American helicopter.

851
01:11:03,244 --> 01:11:04,954
Did you know the Wright Brothers?

852
01:11:05,412 --> 01:11:06,872
-What?
-The Wright Brothers.

853
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:08,124
Orville and Wilbur.

854
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:10,543
They invented the airplane,
and they lived in Indiana.

855
01:11:10,709 --> 01:11:12,253
Wilbur was born in Indiana.

856
01:11:12,419 --> 01:11:14,839
I'm not from Indiana, Teddy.

857
01:11:15,005 --> 01:11:17,550
And the Wright Brothers were born
during the Civil War.

858
01:11:17,716 --> 01:11:19,844
Oh, I thought maybe you went to school
with them.

859
01:11:21,262 --> 01:11:23,722
Oh, come on, Indy. That was funny.

860
01:11:23,889 --> 01:11:24,723
"Funny"?

861
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:29,562
I'm stuck in Tangier with a broken tuk-tuk
and two thieves.

862
01:11:29,728 --> 01:11:30,896
I'm wanted for murder.

863
01:11:31,063 --> 01:11:33,023
Nazis have half of Archimedes' Dial...

864
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:34,608
and your father's notebooks.

865
01:11:35,818 --> 01:11:36,986
I have a copy.

866
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:39,238
Dad's notebooks. I made a copy.

867
01:11:39,405 --> 01:11:40,281
Where?

868
01:11:41,365 --> 01:11:43,325
You memorized five notebooks?

869
01:11:43,492 --> 01:11:44,702
Seven. And of course not.

870
01:11:44,869 --> 01:11:46,495
Half of them were as dull as ditchwater.

871
01:11:47,371 --> 01:11:49,790
Just the really important bits.

872
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:51,667
Like what?

873
01:11:52,126 --> 01:11:53,252
The location of the Grafikos.

874
01:11:53,419 --> 01:11:55,129
Nobody knows where the Grafikos is.

875
01:11:55,296 --> 01:11:56,630
-Dad did.
-No, he didn't.

876
01:11:56,797 --> 01:11:57,965
-Yes, he did.
-No, he didn't.

877
01:11:58,132 --> 01:11:59,758
-Yes, he did.
-What's a Grafikos?

878
01:11:59,925 --> 01:12:01,218
It's directions to the rest of the Dial.

879
01:12:01,385 --> 01:12:02,970
Ask her if she knows what language it's in.

880
01:12:03,137 --> 01:12:04,972
It isn't in a language. It's in a code.

881
01:12:05,139 --> 01:12:06,348
What code?

882
01:12:06,515 --> 01:12:07,975
Archimedes used two codes.

883
01:12:08,142 --> 01:12:09,685
Linear B and Polybius Square.

884
01:12:09,852 --> 01:12:13,230
So, even if you find the Grafikos,
without me, you can't read it.

885
01:12:13,731 --> 01:12:15,024
Please.

886
01:12:15,191 --> 01:12:17,026
Dad taught me Polybius when I was nine.

887
01:12:17,193 --> 01:12:18,778
Used to leave little notes around the house.

888
01:12:18,944 --> 01:12:19,862
"Tidy your room."

889
01:12:20,029 --> 01:12:21,322
"Stay away from my brandy."

890
01:12:22,448 --> 01:12:23,491
What if it's Linear B?

891
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:25,826
50 quid it's Polybius.

892
01:12:26,869 --> 01:12:27,995
Give me that.

893
01:12:28,162 --> 01:12:29,079
Hey.

894
01:12:29,497 --> 01:12:30,706
That won't work.

895
01:12:30,873 --> 01:12:33,125
Moroccan chewing gum's made from the sap
of the Manilkara.

896
01:12:33,292 --> 01:12:34,585
Heat resistant.

897
01:12:36,086 --> 01:12:37,296
Try and start it.

898
01:12:42,218 --> 01:12:43,385
-Start it.
-I am.

899
01:12:45,471 --> 01:12:47,056
Huh? Huh?

900
01:12:47,765 --> 01:12:49,350
-Huh?
-It won't hold.

901
01:12:49,517 --> 01:12:51,435
It'll get us to the train station.

902
01:12:51,602 --> 01:12:52,728
"Us"?

903
01:12:52,895 --> 01:12:54,105
-You goin' home?
-No.

904
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:56,065
I'm going to Casablanca.

905
01:12:56,232 --> 01:12:58,025
Then I'm gonna hop a plane to the Aegean.

906
01:12:58,192 --> 01:12:59,068
Just like you.

907
01:12:59,485 --> 01:13:01,028
What makes you think
we're going to the Aegean?

908
01:13:01,195 --> 01:13:04,281
You gotta get to the Grafikos
before the Nazis.

909
01:13:04,448 --> 01:13:06,534
Archimedes was surrounded by Romans.

910
01:13:07,243 --> 01:13:08,452
Where else would it be?

911
01:13:08,619 --> 01:13:09,620
The Aegean is huge, Indy.

912
01:13:09,787 --> 01:13:10,913
And you don't have coordinates.

913
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:12,623
And you don't have a boat.

914
01:13:15,543 --> 01:13:17,962
I've got an old friend in Greece.

915
01:13:18,129 --> 01:13:19,505
An expert diver.

916
01:13:19,672 --> 01:13:21,507
With a big, beautiful boat...

917
01:13:21,674 --> 01:13:23,717
that'll get us there before they will.

918
01:13:24,593 --> 01:13:26,637
You need me...

919
01:13:26,804 --> 01:13:28,013
and you know it.

920
01:14:18,147 --> 01:14:19,398
Renny!

921
01:14:21,484 --> 01:14:22,359
Indy?

922
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,403
Indy!

923
01:14:29,867 --> 01:14:31,827
So, that's the expert diver?

924
01:14:31,994 --> 01:14:34,205
Spain's greatest frogman.

925
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:38,000
Hey!

926
01:14:38,167 --> 01:14:41,629
So, Spain's greatest frogman has a shit boat
and only one good frog leg?

927
01:14:41,796 --> 01:14:42,838
Stop it.

928
01:14:46,717 --> 01:14:47,968
You got a different boat.

929
01:14:48,135 --> 01:14:48,969
Stop it.

930
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,443
We're going here.

931
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:08,531
Where they found the first part
of the Antikythera.

932
01:15:09,448 --> 01:15:10,407
But...

933
01:15:11,951 --> 01:15:13,244
we're going deeper.

934
01:15:14,829 --> 01:15:18,541
Dad tracked down the old sponge diver
who found the Dial.

935
01:15:18,707 --> 01:15:19,875
He told him...

936
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:23,003
that the wrecked Roman ship broke up
under the sea...

937
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:24,296
70 feet below.

938
01:15:24,463 --> 01:15:27,424
Filled with the skeletons
of over 100 centurions.

939
01:15:28,592 --> 01:15:29,760
That's where they found it.

940
01:15:31,387 --> 01:15:34,431
But he said that most of the ship
had broken off...

941
01:15:34,598 --> 01:15:36,350
and sunk to the ocean floor.

942
01:15:37,309 --> 01:15:38,894
Too deep for sponge divers.

943
01:15:39,937 --> 01:15:42,773
So, Dad started wondering
why a Roman warship...

944
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:46,318
would sail out of Syracuse
with 100 centurions on board.

945
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:53,409
They weren't taking half a Dial
for a joyride.

946
01:15:57,246 --> 01:15:58,831
They had the Grafikos...

947
01:16:01,709 --> 01:16:03,878
and they were looking
for the rest of the Dial.

948
01:16:07,173 --> 01:16:08,799
Your dad was a genius.

949
01:16:09,425 --> 01:16:10,342
Yeah.

950
01:16:11,886 --> 01:16:12,845
He was.

951
01:16:32,782 --> 01:16:33,783
Seven of spades.

952
01:16:37,077 --> 01:16:38,162
How do you do that?

953
01:16:38,329 --> 01:16:39,371
Wow.

954
01:16:40,206 --> 01:16:41,040
Do it again.

955
01:16:45,044 --> 01:16:46,921
Pick a card, Dr. Jones.

956
01:16:54,428 --> 01:16:55,554
Seven of spades!

957
01:16:57,681 --> 01:16:58,724
She's magic.

958
01:16:58,891 --> 01:17:00,059
Trick deck.

959
01:17:00,226 --> 01:17:01,185
No.

960
01:17:02,394 --> 01:17:03,813
I force the card.

961
01:17:03,979 --> 01:17:05,272
I offer the mark...

962
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:06,607
you...

963
01:17:06,774 --> 01:17:07,775
the feeling of a choice...

964
01:17:07,942 --> 01:17:10,152
but ultimately,
I make you pick the card I want.

965
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:13,447
"The mark."

966
01:17:16,492 --> 01:17:18,410
Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day.

967
01:17:18,577 --> 01:17:20,371
I have to check the lines.

968
01:17:26,377 --> 01:17:27,461
Good night.

969
01:17:30,589 --> 01:17:33,717
You remember seeing any dates
in your father's notebooks?

970
01:17:35,052 --> 01:17:36,428
Dates?

971
01:17:36,595 --> 01:17:37,888
What dates?

972
01:17:38,806 --> 01:17:39,807
These dates.

973
01:17:43,519 --> 01:17:45,980
Written over and over again in this letter.

974
01:17:47,398 --> 01:17:49,233
August 20th, 1969.

975
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,943
That's three days from now.

976
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:53,362
And the same date in 1939.

977
01:17:53,529 --> 01:17:55,948
Two weeks before Hitler invades Poland.

978
01:17:58,409 --> 01:17:59,368
Wait.

979
01:18:00,161 --> 01:18:02,496
Now you believe the Dial has magical powers?

980
01:18:03,789 --> 01:18:05,833
I don't believe in magic, Wombat.

981
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:10,087
But a few times in my life, I've seen things.

982
01:18:13,215 --> 01:18:14,967
Things I can't explain.

983
01:18:16,302 --> 01:18:18,679
And I've come to believe it's not so much...

984
01:18:18,846 --> 01:18:20,973
what you believe.

985
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:23,392
It's how hard you believe it.

986
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:27,855
I've seen things too, Indy.

987
01:18:28,773 --> 01:18:31,317
The only thing worth believing in, ever...

988
01:18:31,484 --> 01:18:33,152
is cash.

989
01:18:35,446 --> 01:18:36,530
Right.

990
01:18:42,328 --> 01:18:43,454
What if you could go back in time?

991
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:46,832
What would you do?

992
01:18:48,209 --> 01:18:49,627
Witness the Trojan War?

993
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,254
Check in on Cleopatra?

994
01:18:55,883 --> 01:18:58,010
I'd stop my son from enlisting.

995
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:02,890
Did he sign up to please you?

996
01:19:03,974 --> 01:19:06,185
No, he signed up to piss me off.

997
01:19:09,855 --> 01:19:12,066
How would you have stopped him?

998
01:19:16,237 --> 01:19:18,072
I'd tell him he was gonna die.

999
01:19:25,121 --> 01:19:26,997
I'd tell him that his mother would...

1000
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:31,460
find no end to her grief.

1001
01:19:33,295 --> 01:19:35,047
And that his father would be...

1002
01:19:37,883 --> 01:19:39,802
helpless to console her.

1003
01:19:43,097 --> 01:19:45,599
And that the loss would put an end
to their marriage.

1004
01:19:59,613 --> 01:20:00,823
You're still wearing the ring.

1005
01:20:24,221 --> 01:20:25,181
Promising.

1006
01:20:33,647 --> 01:20:35,065
More promising.

1007
01:20:40,863 --> 01:20:41,947
Hello.

1008
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:46,160
Get your gear on. They're waiting.

1009
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:51,624
Hey.

1010
01:20:52,875 --> 01:20:53,876
Come here.

1011
01:20:54,710 --> 01:20:56,128
Okay.

1012
01:20:56,295 --> 01:20:57,087
I'm gonna show you something.

1013
01:20:57,254 --> 01:20:59,173
Gosh, this looks important.

1014
01:21:02,468 --> 01:21:03,302
Around the rope...

1015
01:21:03,469 --> 01:21:05,638
Now, we are going deep.

1016
01:21:05,805 --> 01:21:08,641
Descend fast,
and breathe through these hoses.

1017
01:21:08,808 --> 01:21:09,642
Okay?

1018
01:21:10,101 --> 01:21:11,644
Stay separate.

1019
01:21:11,811 --> 01:21:13,771
No crisscross. All right?

1020
01:21:13,938 --> 01:21:15,106
We cannot stay long.

1021
01:21:15,272 --> 01:21:18,609
I have a method
that usually prevents the bends.

1022
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:20,653
-Usually?
-Yeah.

1023
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:22,029
I call it "the bounce."

1024
01:21:22,196 --> 01:21:23,197
You know, fast down...

1025
01:21:23,364 --> 01:21:25,282
three minutes on the bottom, and then up.

1026
01:21:25,449 --> 01:21:26,492
Three minutes!

1027
01:21:26,659 --> 01:21:28,494
No one more second.

1028
01:21:29,161 --> 01:21:30,037
Three minutes.

1029
01:21:30,496 --> 01:21:31,413
Yeah, that's right.

1030
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:33,415
-Where is my lighter?
-I don't know, <i>capitán.</i>

1031
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:35,584
We have to go.

1032
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:39,380
Quick question.

1033
01:21:39,547 --> 01:21:40,881
What's that?

1034
01:21:41,048 --> 01:21:42,341
-They're sharks?
-No.

1035
01:21:42,508 --> 01:21:44,885
No, no. No sharks here. Eels.

1036
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:46,887
Eels?

1037
01:21:47,054 --> 01:21:48,264
Anguilas.

1038
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:49,348
Most are small.

1039
01:21:49,515 --> 01:21:51,100
Sometimes they are big. Two meters.

1040
01:21:51,267 --> 01:21:53,310
But if you see them, stay still.

1041
01:21:53,477 --> 01:21:56,689
They bite you, they lock the jaw. Yeah.

1042
01:21:56,856 --> 01:21:58,274
They look like snakes.

1043
01:21:59,150 --> 01:22:00,025
No, they don't.

1044
01:22:00,568 --> 01:22:02,236
Private Brandy reporting for duty.

1045
01:22:02,862 --> 01:22:03,737
You're not coming, Teddy?

1046
01:22:04,488 --> 01:22:05,614
I can't swim.

1047
01:22:05,781 --> 01:22:06,907
Lucky him.

1048
01:22:07,074 --> 01:22:08,367
Everyone can swim.

1049
01:22:10,244 --> 01:22:12,204
Reach and pull. Reach and pull.

1050
01:22:14,248 --> 01:22:16,500
All right. You stay here with Hector
and watch our lines.

1051
01:22:20,337 --> 01:22:21,547
It is time, <i>camarada.</i>

1052
01:24:09,989 --> 01:24:10,906
Two minutes?

1053
01:25:42,373 --> 01:25:43,207
<i>I got it.</i>

1054
01:26:24,206 --> 01:26:25,040
Hey.

1055
01:26:57,114 --> 01:26:57,948
<i>Hurry up!</i>

1056
01:27:13,088 --> 01:27:14,590
Helena!

1057
01:27:23,516 --> 01:27:24,350
Come on.

1058
01:27:24,517 --> 01:27:26,060
That's it. That's it. That's it.

1059
01:27:26,894 --> 01:27:28,104
That's it.

1060
01:27:51,252 --> 01:27:52,503
Who are these people?

1061
01:27:54,964 --> 01:27:55,798
Nazis.

1062
01:27:55,965 --> 01:27:58,425
First, you return my Dial, Dr. Jones...

1063
01:27:58,592 --> 01:28:01,720
and now, you bring me the Grafikos.

1064
01:28:02,638 --> 01:28:04,807
I'm very happy you're not wasting
in retirement.

1065
01:28:05,182 --> 01:28:07,560
I should have retired you
when I had the chance.

1066
01:28:07,726 --> 01:28:08,853
Where are your sponsors?

1067
01:28:09,019 --> 01:28:10,604
I'm on my own now.

1068
01:28:10,771 --> 01:28:12,481
Things move forward, Dr. Jones.

1069
01:28:12,648 --> 01:28:13,524
And sometimes...

1070
01:28:15,401 --> 01:28:17,194
they go backward.

1071
01:28:20,448 --> 01:28:22,700
Now, let's get comfortable
and have a little talk.

1072
01:28:49,769 --> 01:28:51,145
What language is that?

1073
01:28:51,312 --> 01:28:52,897
It's not a language.

1074
01:28:54,148 --> 01:28:55,232
It's a code.

1075
01:28:56,192 --> 01:28:57,067
Polybius.

1076
01:28:57,902 --> 01:28:59,195
You owe me 50 quid.

1077
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:03,324
Not familiar with Polybius cipher?

1078
01:29:03,491 --> 01:29:04,408
No.

1079
01:29:05,242 --> 01:29:06,660
But it appears you are.

1080
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:11,999
Read it, please.

1081
01:29:20,424 --> 01:29:21,383
No.

1082
01:29:27,139 --> 01:29:28,140
Indy...

1083
01:29:39,235 --> 01:29:40,528
Feeling helpful now?

1084
01:29:43,948 --> 01:29:44,782
I am.

1085
01:29:47,952 --> 01:29:49,203
I know this stuff backwards.

1086
01:29:49,370 --> 01:29:50,246
No!

1087
01:29:52,123 --> 01:29:53,040
Sorry, Indy.

1088
01:29:53,457 --> 01:29:54,834
I don't do noble death.

1089
01:29:55,501 --> 01:29:56,585
Just...

1090
01:29:56,752 --> 01:29:58,170
cold, hard maths.

1091
01:29:58,712 --> 01:30:00,548
I crack the code,
help you find the other half.

1092
01:30:01,966 --> 01:30:03,634
One hundred grand. Cash.

1093
01:30:03,801 --> 01:30:04,760
Helena...

1094
01:30:05,427 --> 01:30:06,387
Take it or leave it.

1095
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:08,973
You have a deal.

1096
01:30:22,570 --> 01:30:24,280
He'll never pay you.

1097
01:30:25,823 --> 01:30:28,701
I think you will find this is worth
more than your asking price.

1098
01:30:38,210 --> 01:30:39,712
-Teddy.
-Helena...

1099
01:30:39,879 --> 01:30:41,046
don't do this.

1100
01:30:46,469 --> 01:30:47,887
Let's see what we've got here.

1101
01:30:50,055 --> 01:30:51,432
"My <i>Makhana...</i>"

1102
01:30:52,099 --> 01:30:52,933
that's "machine"...

1103
01:30:54,185 --> 01:30:57,730
"lies with me, in the city I left.

1104
01:30:57,897 --> 01:31:00,274
"Where wolves teach men to walk.

1105
01:31:00,441 --> 01:31:04,570
"Under one of nine, I lie."

1106
01:31:07,406 --> 01:31:09,116
Only one thing lies anywhere forever.

1107
01:31:09,283 --> 01:31:11,994
The dead. So, if the Dial lies with him,
then...

1108
01:31:13,871 --> 01:31:15,372
then this is directions to his tomb.

1109
01:31:15,873 --> 01:31:17,208
The Tomb of Archimedes?

1110
01:31:18,626 --> 01:31:20,419
Undiscovered for two millennia.

1111
01:31:23,506 --> 01:31:25,591
"The city I left."

1112
01:31:26,217 --> 01:31:29,678
Archimedes lived two places his entire life,
so he only left one.

1113
01:31:30,554 --> 01:31:32,556
Anyone? At the back?

1114
01:31:33,432 --> 01:31:34,975
Come on, Indy. Everyone knows this.

1115
01:31:35,142 --> 01:31:35,976
Even this clown.

1116
01:31:36,143 --> 01:31:37,478
Alexandria.

1117
01:31:37,645 --> 01:31:38,687
Full marks.

1118
01:31:39,939 --> 01:31:42,108
Now, "wolf" in Greek is "<i>lycos</i>."

1119
01:31:42,274 --> 01:31:44,527
Root of the word "<i>lycaeum"</i> or "school."

1120
01:31:44,693 --> 01:31:47,321
And the Doric for "walking" is...

1121
01:31:48,739 --> 01:31:49,573
<i>"peripatio."</i>

1122
01:31:50,866 --> 01:31:53,619
Which also happens to be the word for...

1123
01:31:58,874 --> 01:32:00,835
I thought you were a bright spark.

1124
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:06,549
<i>"Peripatio" </i>means "walking"...

1125
01:32:06,715 --> 01:32:09,135
but it also means "counting."

1126
01:32:09,301 --> 01:32:12,429
So, "Where wolves teach men to walk"...

1127
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:15,474
-could be...
-The School of Mathematics.

1128
01:32:16,809 --> 01:32:18,394
Is correct.

1129
01:32:18,561 --> 01:32:20,104
Now, the next bit is easy.

1130
01:32:21,397 --> 01:32:22,982
"Beneath one of nine"?

1131
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:25,484
There are nine Muses.

1132
01:32:25,651 --> 01:32:26,777
The <i>Museon.</i>

1133
01:32:26,944 --> 01:32:29,405
The Greek word
for the Great Library of Alexandria.

1134
01:32:29,572 --> 01:32:33,367
Which, as we all know, has nine statues
supporting its roof.

1135
01:32:33,534 --> 01:32:34,452
May I?

1136
01:32:35,703 --> 01:32:36,537
Thank you.

1137
01:32:37,997 --> 01:32:40,749
The nine Muses, in reverse order...

1138
01:32:42,209 --> 01:32:43,711
are Calliope...

1139
01:32:44,628 --> 01:32:45,463
Urania...

1140
01:32:47,047 --> 01:32:48,090
Polymnia...

1141
01:32:49,049 --> 01:32:50,593
-Erato...
-Polymnia.

1142
01:32:50,801 --> 01:32:53,179
...and Meli whasisname...

1143
01:32:53,721 --> 01:32:54,555
that other one...

1144
01:32:55,431 --> 01:32:56,307
Thalia...

1145
01:32:57,057 --> 01:32:58,267
Euteroe...

1146
01:32:58,434 --> 01:33:00,519
but the first is...

1147
01:33:00,936 --> 01:33:01,771
Clio.

1148
01:33:03,606 --> 01:33:04,774
The Muse of history and time.

1149
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:06,150
That Archimedes...

1150
01:33:06,317 --> 01:33:07,485
-what a clever bugger.
-The entrance...

1151
01:33:07,651 --> 01:33:09,779
to the tomb
is by the School of Mathematics...

1152
01:33:09,945 --> 01:33:11,655
under a statue of Clio...

1153
01:33:11,822 --> 01:33:14,575
in the ruins
of the Great Library of Alexandria.

1154
01:33:14,742 --> 01:33:16,035
Gold star for Dr. Brains.

1155
01:33:17,578 --> 01:33:18,412
Teddy!

1156
01:33:28,464 --> 01:33:29,924
The Grafikos, get it!

1157
01:33:57,576 --> 01:34:00,287
I have said it before,
and I will say it again!

1158
01:34:00,454 --> 01:34:03,082
When you're in a tight spot, dynamite.

1159
01:34:04,834 --> 01:34:06,377
My friend was just murdered.

1160
01:34:11,882 --> 01:34:12,883
Sorry.

1161
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:14,802
You told them everything.

1162
01:34:16,512 --> 01:34:17,596
Word for word.

1163
01:34:18,222 --> 01:34:20,141
But Archimedes didn't make it that easy.

1164
01:34:20,933 --> 01:34:22,852
The tomb isn't in Alexandria.

1165
01:34:31,902 --> 01:34:32,903
Go!

1166
01:34:36,407 --> 01:34:37,366
So, what do you see?

1167
01:34:38,033 --> 01:34:39,827
Polybius square.

1168
01:34:40,369 --> 01:34:41,495
Made of?

1169
01:34:44,039 --> 01:34:45,249
Wax and wood.

1170
01:34:46,876 --> 01:34:48,127
Anything else?

1171
01:34:51,714 --> 01:34:52,590
It's heavy.

1172
01:34:55,634 --> 01:34:56,760
Too heavy.

1173
01:34:58,888 --> 01:35:00,014
Give me that.

1174
01:35:40,221 --> 01:35:41,931
This is solid gold?

1175
01:35:42,097 --> 01:35:43,307
Ancient gold.

1176
01:35:44,809 --> 01:35:45,810
From the Nile.

1177
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:48,479
Hold it, Teddy.

1178
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:01,075
Sell this thing...

1179
01:36:01,242 --> 01:36:02,910
and we are out of the hole and then some.

1180
01:36:03,077 --> 01:36:03,994
I have just the customer.

1181
01:36:04,161 --> 01:36:07,164
-Cranky, old Duchess in Gibraltar...
-This is going in a museum.

1182
01:36:10,459 --> 01:36:11,752
Take the wheel, Teddy.

1183
01:36:18,634 --> 01:36:19,635
What does it say?

1184
01:36:21,762 --> 01:36:24,640
"Search where Dionysius...

1185
01:36:25,432 --> 01:36:28,185
"hears each whisper...

1186
01:36:29,019 --> 01:36:31,063
"like a hurricane."

1187
01:36:33,899 --> 01:36:35,317
The Ear.

1188
01:36:36,026 --> 01:36:37,820
The cave of Dionysius.

1189
01:36:38,696 --> 01:36:39,655
Where is that?

1190
01:36:41,115 --> 01:36:42,158
In Sicily.

1191
01:36:43,659 --> 01:36:45,744
-How much fuel have we got?
-It's full.

1192
01:36:54,753 --> 01:36:55,754
They're heading west.

1193
01:36:57,131 --> 01:36:58,048
Not east.

1194
01:37:27,077 --> 01:37:27,995
I want the papaya.

1195
01:37:28,162 --> 01:37:29,205
How much is it?

1196
01:37:32,666 --> 01:37:33,542
Take this.

1197
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:38,589
Look at that kid with the straw hat.

1198
01:37:39,757 --> 01:37:40,674
This way.

1199
01:37:43,844 --> 01:37:44,678
Hey.

1200
01:37:46,305 --> 01:37:47,515
What do you think?

1201
01:37:54,563 --> 01:37:55,815
What are we doing?

1202
01:37:57,441 --> 01:37:59,110
Waiting for closing time at the caves.

1203
01:37:59,276 --> 01:38:00,778
It's crawling with tourists.

1204
01:38:00,945 --> 01:38:03,364
Okay, so he's, like, running the show now?

1205
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:06,158
He's not running the show, Teddy.

1206
01:38:07,535 --> 01:38:10,663
I just thought we were in this
for all the wrong reasons.

1207
01:38:11,247 --> 01:38:12,414
We are.

1208
01:38:15,918 --> 01:38:16,794
Most assuredly.

1209
01:38:16,961 --> 01:38:19,755
You know he's never gonna let us sell
any of that stuff.

1210
01:38:21,257 --> 01:38:22,925
I'm still in charge, Teddy.

1211
01:38:23,092 --> 01:38:25,094
Helena, get over here! Give me a hand!

1212
01:38:31,016 --> 01:38:32,143
You splurged.

1213
01:38:33,477 --> 01:38:34,437
Here's your backpack.

1214
01:38:34,603 --> 01:38:35,563
Where's the kid?

1215
01:38:49,577 --> 01:38:50,619
Hey, watch it!

1216
01:38:51,245 --> 01:38:52,496
What's wrong with you?

1217
01:39:21,025 --> 01:39:22,193
Hello.

1218
01:39:23,778 --> 01:39:24,612
Hey.

1219
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:28,616
Let me go!

1220
01:39:29,909 --> 01:39:30,951
Let me go!

1221
01:39:38,751 --> 01:39:40,961
Get off me! Let me go!

1222
01:39:44,632 --> 01:39:45,508
Hey, hey, hey!

1223
01:39:56,685 --> 01:39:57,770
Helena!

1224
01:39:59,146 --> 01:40:00,606
They've got Teddy.

1225
01:40:02,691 --> 01:40:04,276
They took him up the hill somewhere.

1226
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:25,464
What are they gonna do to him?

1227
01:40:25,631 --> 01:40:28,300
He knows about the Ear,
what the Grafikos says.

1228
01:40:29,677 --> 01:40:31,137
They're not gonna hurt him.

1229
01:40:31,303 --> 01:40:32,471
They're gonna use him...

1230
01:40:33,222 --> 01:40:35,474
to get the other half of the Dial.

1231
01:40:35,641 --> 01:40:37,017
We gotta get there first.

1232
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:53,826
Colonizing queens built many cities
in Sicily.

1233
01:40:53,993 --> 01:40:55,494
-The temple...
-Let's go.

1234
01:40:56,162 --> 01:40:58,706
...is the oldest of the Greek temples.

1235
01:40:59,790 --> 01:41:01,167
The cave's over there.

1236
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:13,304
Could we go a little faster, please?

1237
01:41:22,521 --> 01:41:23,981
The Ear of Dionysius.

1238
01:41:31,697 --> 01:41:32,656
Wow.

1239
01:41:46,921 --> 01:41:50,424
"Search where Dionysius hears each whisper
like a hurricane."

1240
01:41:51,634 --> 01:41:52,635
That's some echo.

1241
01:41:54,386 --> 01:41:56,972
Keep making noise till we find out
where it's loudest.

1242
01:42:14,406 --> 01:42:15,241
Stop.

1243
01:42:23,165 --> 01:42:24,291
This is it.

1244
01:42:29,255 --> 01:42:30,256
Greek pediment.

1245
01:42:31,423 --> 01:42:32,424
An entrance.

1246
01:42:33,843 --> 01:42:34,844
Used to be.

1247
01:42:38,139 --> 01:42:39,140
A crescent.

1248
01:42:42,017 --> 01:42:43,102
Just like on the Grafikos.

1249
01:42:50,693 --> 01:42:52,528
I think there's an opening up there.

1250
01:42:59,285 --> 01:43:00,161
You okay up there?

1251
01:43:01,328 --> 01:43:02,163
Yes.

1252
01:43:04,999 --> 01:43:06,041
You're not moving.

1253
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,753
I'm thinking.

1254
01:43:12,715 --> 01:43:13,591
About?

1255
01:43:14,758 --> 01:43:17,678
About what the hell I'm doing up here,
40 feet in the air...

1256
01:43:18,012 --> 01:43:19,597
with crap shoulders...

1257
01:43:19,763 --> 01:43:21,557
crumbling vertebrae...

1258
01:43:21,724 --> 01:43:24,226
a plate in one leg, screws in the other.

1259
01:43:24,393 --> 01:43:25,644
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

1260
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:27,396
No, you don't get it.

1261
01:43:28,230 --> 01:43:29,440
You're half my age.

1262
01:43:30,483 --> 01:43:33,152
You haven't been forced
to drink the blood of Kali.

1263
01:43:33,319 --> 01:43:34,570
No. Fair enough.

1264
01:43:35,404 --> 01:43:37,156
Or been tortured with voodoo.

1265
01:43:38,532 --> 01:43:41,285
And I'm just guessing, but I don't think
you've been shot nine times...

1266
01:43:41,452 --> 01:43:43,913
including once by your father.

1267
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,999
Dad shot you?

1268
01:43:47,708 --> 01:43:48,876
Don't talk to me.

1269
01:43:49,043 --> 01:43:50,211
Just go ahead. I'll follow you.

1270
01:43:58,969 --> 01:43:59,845
No, no, no.

1271
01:44:00,012 --> 01:44:01,555
We are close. We are close.

1272
01:44:01,722 --> 01:44:02,723
Look around you.

1273
01:44:02,890 --> 01:44:04,391
-We are close.
-The Cave of Dionysius.

1274
01:44:04,558 --> 01:44:05,351
No, no, no.

1275
01:44:05,518 --> 01:44:07,436
The cave is closed for renovation.

1276
01:44:09,522 --> 01:44:10,481
Let me ask again.

1277
01:44:10,648 --> 01:44:12,566
Where is the Cave of Dionysius?

1278
01:44:32,211 --> 01:44:34,380
What's the matter? You worried about the kid?

1279
01:44:35,673 --> 01:44:37,341
Are you sure they won't hurt him?

1280
01:44:37,508 --> 01:44:38,717
He'll be fine.

1281
01:44:38,884 --> 01:44:39,927
He's smart.

1282
01:44:41,804 --> 01:44:43,180
Where'd you find him?

1283
01:44:44,890 --> 01:44:49,562
He tried to steal my purse outside a casino
in Marrakesh when he was 10.

1284
01:44:49,728 --> 01:44:51,564
I hit him repeatedly with my car door...

1285
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:54,233
but he didn't let go and neither did I.

1286
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:55,943
So, been together ever since.

1287
01:44:57,069 --> 01:44:59,029
Thought you were all about the money.

1288
01:45:00,156 --> 01:45:01,157
I am.

1289
01:45:04,243 --> 01:45:08,289
Nobody memorizes every page
of their dead father's notebooks...

1290
01:45:08,456 --> 01:45:09,540
for the money.

1291
01:45:16,172 --> 01:45:17,173
<i>Herr</i> Voller!

1292
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:29,185
They went that way.

1293
01:45:39,528 --> 01:45:40,571
Why?

1294
01:45:44,492 --> 01:45:46,327
Come on, come on.

1295
01:45:49,079 --> 01:45:49,997
Let's go.

1296
01:45:54,835 --> 01:45:55,753
Oh, my...

1297
01:45:58,756 --> 01:46:00,257
Oh, my God!

1298
01:46:01,091 --> 01:46:02,426
Oh, my God!

1299
01:46:02,635 --> 01:46:04,011
-Oh, God!
-No, no.

1300
01:46:04,929 --> 01:46:06,305
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1301
01:46:10,851 --> 01:46:11,894
Are they off me?

1302
01:46:12,061 --> 01:46:12,895
-Get 'em off!
-No, no.

1303
01:46:13,062 --> 01:46:14,230
-Get 'em off!
-Wait.

1304
01:46:27,284 --> 01:46:28,244
What is that?

1305
01:46:31,330 --> 01:46:32,373
Methane.

1306
01:46:33,874 --> 01:46:35,084
Don't breathe.

1307
01:46:35,251 --> 01:46:36,252
Don't breathe?

1308
01:46:39,964 --> 01:46:41,340
We've gotta get outta here.

1309
01:46:50,266 --> 01:46:51,183
Athena.

1310
01:46:52,935 --> 01:46:54,228
Goddess of war.

1311
01:46:57,106 --> 01:46:58,315
And reason.

1312
01:47:02,611 --> 01:47:03,988
"Under the moon...

1313
01:47:06,282 --> 01:47:08,284
"life lies at her feet."

1314
01:47:16,041 --> 01:47:17,376
Water displacement.

1315
01:47:18,169 --> 01:47:19,503
Get in the pool!

1316
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:21,672
Why? Help me open the door.

1317
01:47:21,839 --> 01:47:23,507
Well, they didn't get out the doors!

1318
01:47:23,674 --> 01:47:24,550
Get in the pool!

1319
01:47:25,593 --> 01:47:27,470
Okay, I'm getting in the pool.

1320
01:47:27,636 --> 01:47:28,762
Help me.

1321
01:47:31,474 --> 01:47:33,517
Archimedes was fascinated...

1322
01:47:35,019 --> 01:47:36,979
by water displacement!

1323
01:48:18,187 --> 01:48:19,355
Hey! Get back here!

1324
01:48:19,522 --> 01:48:20,272
Klaber!

1325
01:48:34,495 --> 01:48:35,663
You don't need to do that.

1326
01:49:01,856 --> 01:49:02,690
Hey!

1327
01:49:03,899 --> 01:49:04,733
Give me that!

1328
01:49:06,694 --> 01:49:07,528
No!

1329
01:49:14,952 --> 01:49:16,245
Leave them.

1330
01:49:16,954 --> 01:49:18,581
I said leave them.

1331
01:49:43,022 --> 01:49:44,565
Reach and pull.

1332
01:49:44,732 --> 01:49:46,317
Reach and pull.

1333
01:49:46,484 --> 01:49:48,652
Reach and pull.

1334
01:50:17,097 --> 01:50:18,641
Archimedes' tomb.

1335
01:50:47,586 --> 01:50:48,879
Grab that corner.

1336
01:51:35,217 --> 01:51:36,135
Indy.

1337
01:51:38,512 --> 01:51:39,889
This frieze...

1338
01:51:42,558 --> 01:51:43,809
It's a phoenix.

1339
01:51:43,976 --> 01:51:44,977
A common icon.

1340
01:51:45,144 --> 01:51:46,729
No. Look, it isn't.

1341
01:51:48,314 --> 01:51:50,024
This phoenix has propellers.

1342
01:51:58,908 --> 01:52:00,367
What's this doing here?

1343
01:52:09,168 --> 01:52:12,171
Clocks won't be invented
for 1,000 years...

1344
01:52:12,838 --> 01:52:14,298
much less watches.

1345
01:52:16,842 --> 01:52:18,052
Archimedes used it.

1346
01:52:21,597 --> 01:52:22,973
Dad was right.

1347
01:52:23,724 --> 01:52:24,558
It works.

1348
01:52:24,725 --> 01:52:26,352
Of course it works, Miss Shaw.

1349
01:52:29,063 --> 01:52:30,314
Mathematics works.

1350
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:34,443
As it conquered space, it will conquer time.

1351
01:52:42,326 --> 01:52:44,245
You've already lost your son, Dr. Jones.

1352
01:52:44,411 --> 01:52:45,329
Your wife is gone.

1353
01:52:45,496 --> 01:52:47,414
Do you really want to lose your godchild?

1354
01:52:50,501 --> 01:52:51,585
For what?

1355
01:52:52,002 --> 01:52:54,171
A world that no longer cares
about men like us.

1356
01:53:05,683 --> 01:53:06,517
Thank you.

1357
01:53:45,222 --> 01:53:46,599
History's greatest moment.

1358
01:53:53,689 --> 01:53:54,982
Its end.

1359
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:03,657
Throw me the gun!

1360
01:54:14,043 --> 01:54:15,294
Get him outta here.

1361
01:54:15,461 --> 01:54:16,295
Teddy.

1362
01:54:17,338 --> 01:54:18,464
Teddy! Teddy!

1363
01:54:18,631 --> 01:54:19,715
Come on! Go!

1364
01:54:19,882 --> 01:54:20,758
This way. Come on.

1365
01:54:24,845 --> 01:54:25,679
Go!

1366
01:54:30,142 --> 01:54:30,976
Indy!

1367
01:54:32,978 --> 01:54:34,146
Go!

1368
01:54:34,313 --> 01:54:35,564
Go!

1369
01:54:35,731 --> 01:54:36,816
Stop!

1370
01:54:40,194 --> 01:54:41,612
Now what?

1371
01:54:43,239 --> 01:54:44,240
Bring him.

1372
01:54:52,331 --> 01:54:53,332
Helena, come on!

1373
01:54:53,499 --> 01:54:54,834
-Teddy, we can't just leave him.
-We're not!

1374
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,210
Follow me!

1375
01:54:58,170 --> 01:54:59,171
Come on!

1376
01:55:03,092 --> 01:55:03,926
Come on.

1377
01:55:18,357 --> 01:55:20,317
Teddy. Come on. We've got a car.

1378
01:55:25,239 --> 01:55:26,198
Crap.

1379
01:55:32,413 --> 01:55:33,456
Stay there.

1380
01:55:52,349 --> 01:55:53,350
Hop on.

1381
01:55:56,979 --> 01:55:59,899
The first hemisphere sets the destination.

1382
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:04,987
The second calculates the location
of the fissure...

1383
01:56:06,238 --> 01:56:08,073
in Alexandrine coordinates.

1384
01:56:08,657 --> 01:56:11,535
Have Messner transpose this
to longitude and latitude...

1385
01:56:12,578 --> 01:56:14,455
and transmit waypoints to the pilots.

1386
01:56:26,592 --> 01:56:28,093
Shortcut.

1387
01:56:32,389 --> 01:56:36,769
-You got coordinates for 37.07.
-So, who is it?

1388
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:38,771
Churchill?

1389
01:56:40,106 --> 01:56:41,107
Ike?

1390
01:56:43,442 --> 01:56:45,945
Who are you gonna kill to win the war?

1391
01:56:46,779 --> 01:56:49,657
In a few minutes,
with the help of Archimedes...

1392
01:56:49,824 --> 01:56:51,700
we shall fly into the eye of this storm...

1393
01:56:52,493 --> 01:56:54,745
and cross into Sicilian airspace...

1394
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:58,415
on August 20th, 1939.

1395
01:56:59,166 --> 01:57:02,711
We will head north over friendly skies
with enough fuel to reach Munich.

1396
01:57:04,004 --> 01:57:05,631
My quarry will be waiting for me...

1397
01:57:05,798 --> 01:57:08,634
at 16 Prinzregentenplatz...

1398
01:57:09,009 --> 01:57:11,220
for an update on his V-1 rocket.

1399
01:57:18,227 --> 01:57:22,189
What kind of Nazi kills the Führer?

1400
01:57:23,816 --> 01:57:26,485
The kind that believes in victory, Dr. Jones.

1401
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:35,578
Hitler lit a fire that could have burned
1,000 years.

1402
01:57:35,744 --> 01:57:37,246
I saw every mistake.

1403
01:57:38,038 --> 01:57:39,331
Every blunder.

1404
01:57:39,498 --> 01:57:41,167
And I will correct them all.

1405
01:57:41,333 --> 01:57:43,961
History is a long list of losses, Dr. Jones.

1406
01:57:45,004 --> 01:57:46,255
It's just a question of whose.

1407
01:57:58,934 --> 01:57:59,935
Stop!

1408
01:59:13,092 --> 01:59:13,926
Teddy.

1409
01:59:15,761 --> 01:59:16,762
You think you can fly one of those?

1410
01:59:18,931 --> 01:59:19,765
A Nord?

1411
01:59:22,518 --> 01:59:23,477
Sure.

1412
01:59:24,228 --> 01:59:25,354
It's not a ringing response.

1413
01:59:25,521 --> 01:59:27,148
Well, I haven't flown a Nord.

1414
01:59:27,314 --> 01:59:28,858
You've never flown any plane.

1415
01:59:30,734 --> 01:59:31,861
I'll get it started.

1416
01:59:32,027 --> 01:59:33,279
No, Teddy.

1417
01:59:34,655 --> 01:59:35,489
Crap.

1418
02:00:02,850 --> 02:00:04,435
Fasten your seat belt, Dr. Jones.

1419
02:00:04,602 --> 02:00:05,936
There might be some turbulence.

1420
02:00:06,896 --> 02:00:09,356
You're German, Voller.

1421
02:00:09,523 --> 02:00:11,525
Don't try and be funny.

1422
02:00:34,924 --> 02:00:36,759
Come on, big talker.

1423
02:00:51,732 --> 02:00:52,566
Okay.

1424
02:01:09,416 --> 02:01:11,001
Okay. Okay.

1425
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:13,712
Gauges green. Power full.

1426
02:01:14,380 --> 02:01:16,882
And when I reach 85, I rotate.

1427
02:01:54,628 --> 02:01:56,046
Okay, wings down.

1428
02:01:58,132 --> 02:02:00,134
Okay, 84 miles an hour.

1429
02:02:00,593 --> 02:02:01,552
Rotate.

1430
02:03:18,879 --> 02:03:20,339
Continental drift.

1431
02:03:23,759 --> 02:03:24,969
Continental drift!

1432
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:29,306
Archimedes didn't know
about continental drift.

1433
02:03:30,141 --> 02:03:31,392
He couldn't have!

1434
02:03:32,393 --> 02:03:34,311
It hadn't been observed yet.

1435
02:03:35,312 --> 02:03:37,106
You're off target.

1436
02:03:37,565 --> 02:03:39,442
Your coordinates are based on markers...

1437
02:03:40,192 --> 02:03:43,404
that have been moving for 2000 years!

1438
02:03:43,571 --> 02:03:46,991
You could be off by 10 degrees, by...

1439
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:05,634
<i>Herr </i>Voller<i>...</i>

1440
02:04:05,801 --> 02:04:08,512
Your calculations are wrong!

1441
02:04:09,096 --> 02:04:10,264
-<i>Herr </i>Voller...
<i>-</i>Will you shut up?

1442
02:04:10,931 --> 02:04:11,932
I'm thinking!

1443
02:04:18,606 --> 02:04:19,690
Hold the flight path!

1444
02:04:26,530 --> 02:04:27,990
I don't know where we're going, Jürgen.

1445
02:04:30,701 --> 02:04:31,535
But it sure as hell...

1446
02:04:33,579 --> 02:04:34,246
...ain't 1939!

1447
02:06:18,142 --> 02:06:19,226
That's Sicily.

1448
02:06:19,393 --> 02:06:20,603
1939.

1449
02:06:22,354 --> 02:06:23,773
I did it.

1450
02:06:23,939 --> 02:06:25,441
I did it, Dr. Jones!

1451
02:06:34,283 --> 02:06:36,327
Yesterday belongs to us, Dr. Jones.

1452
02:07:01,227 --> 02:07:03,395
Those are Roman triremes.

1453
02:07:31,632 --> 02:07:32,842
Keep it in the air!

1454
02:08:03,706 --> 02:08:05,082
Amazing.

1455
02:08:14,550 --> 02:08:15,509
Open the door!

1456
02:08:20,473 --> 02:08:21,474
What are you doing?

1457
02:08:22,433 --> 02:08:24,143
What are you doing, you idiots?

1458
02:08:24,310 --> 02:08:26,103
They think we're a monster!

1459
02:08:32,568 --> 02:08:34,069
You have to turn around.

1460
02:08:34,236 --> 02:08:36,155
This is the Siege of Syracuse.

1461
02:08:37,281 --> 02:08:38,616
214 BC.

1462
02:08:38,783 --> 02:08:39,992
You got the wrong war.

1463
02:09:11,982 --> 02:09:12,817
Boss!

1464
02:09:51,063 --> 02:09:51,981
Get out of the way!

1465
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:00,448
How do you like that, you savages?

1466
02:10:03,492 --> 02:10:06,245
Sorry, pal, but you're a Nazi!

1467
02:10:16,297 --> 02:10:18,382
What are you doing here?

1468
02:10:18,549 --> 02:10:20,092
Rescuing you!

1469
02:10:31,645 --> 02:10:32,521
Get him off!

1470
02:10:33,898 --> 02:10:34,982
Indy!

1471
02:10:40,613 --> 02:10:41,822
Parachute!

1472
02:10:44,617 --> 02:10:45,785
I got a parachute!

1473
02:10:47,286 --> 02:10:48,120
Hang on!

1474
02:10:51,916 --> 02:10:52,792
Let go!

1475
02:10:55,127 --> 02:10:56,545
Give me the parachute!

1476
02:11:02,593 --> 02:11:04,720
Grab it. Hang on!

1477
02:11:07,181 --> 02:11:08,015
Indy!

1478
02:12:00,734 --> 02:12:03,195
Hey, those are my friends.

1479
02:12:03,362 --> 02:12:05,406
Those are my friends. We need to help them!

1480
02:12:06,574 --> 02:12:08,159
Those are my friends!

1481
02:13:28,614 --> 02:13:29,490
He's trying to land.

1482
02:13:29,657 --> 02:13:31,659
Come on, Indy. Help me.

1483
02:13:32,409 --> 02:13:34,453
Get up. Yeah.

1484
02:13:34,620 --> 02:13:36,914
We need to get you out of here. Okay.

1485
02:13:38,833 --> 02:13:40,126
Help me. Sit up, okay?

1486
02:13:41,001 --> 02:13:42,253
Sit up. You need to help me.

1487
02:13:42,419 --> 02:13:44,296
I know it hurts, but we gotta get you back.

1488
02:13:44,463 --> 02:13:47,174
This is incredible, Wombat.

1489
02:13:47,716 --> 02:13:49,677
Incredible.

1490
02:13:51,220 --> 02:13:52,930
Yeah, it very well is.

1491
02:13:53,097 --> 02:13:54,682
But we have to get you out of here.

1492
02:13:56,809 --> 02:13:57,935
My God.

1493
02:13:59,603 --> 02:14:01,480
We're witnessing history.

1494
02:14:08,571 --> 02:14:10,364
Reverse these numbers.

1495
02:14:10,531 --> 02:14:11,615
They'll get you home.

1496
02:14:13,451 --> 02:14:14,285
What?

1497
02:14:17,204 --> 02:14:18,414
I'm going to stay.

1498
02:14:19,165 --> 02:14:21,167
No. You're not serious.

1499
02:14:24,003 --> 02:14:25,045
Wow, you are serious.

1500
02:14:29,133 --> 02:14:30,843
Indy, you've been shot.

1501
02:14:31,010 --> 02:14:31,844
You're bleeding.

1502
02:14:32,219 --> 02:14:33,804
You can't stay here.

1503
02:14:33,971 --> 02:14:34,847
Yes, I can.

1504
02:14:35,514 --> 02:14:36,474
But for what?

1505
02:14:36,640 --> 02:14:40,186
For a long, painful death
with poultice and leeches?

1506
02:14:41,228 --> 02:14:43,355
I've imagined this, Wombat.

1507
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:46,275
Studied it.

1508
02:14:46,442 --> 02:14:48,486
-All my life.
-Yeah.

1509
02:14:48,652 --> 02:14:51,739
And if you stay here,
you will muck it all up.

1510
02:14:51,906 --> 02:14:52,740
And die.

1511
02:14:53,491 --> 02:14:55,117
Please, get up.

1512
02:14:56,869 --> 02:14:58,037
Helena!

1513
02:14:58,579 --> 02:14:59,371
I did it!

1514
02:14:59,538 --> 02:15:01,874
Bravo, Teddy! Three cheers!

1515
02:15:02,041 --> 02:15:03,584
Okay. Indy, we've gotta go. Get up.

1516
02:15:03,751 --> 02:15:05,211
-I need to get you into that plane, okay?
-No.

1517
02:15:05,377 --> 02:15:06,295
-We need to.
-No.

1518
02:15:06,462 --> 02:15:08,088
Get up. You can... We can!

1519
02:15:28,192 --> 02:15:29,193
It's him.

1520
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:40,204
He's asking how far we've come.

1521
02:16:16,824 --> 02:16:18,617
That dial is a forced deck.

1522
02:16:18,784 --> 02:16:20,202
It doesn't take us anywhere but here.

1523
02:16:20,369 --> 02:16:21,662
He built it to get help.

1524
02:16:21,829 --> 02:16:24,373
Well, we just scared off
the entire Roman Navy...

1525
02:16:24,540 --> 02:16:25,458
so I think we've helped enough.

1526
02:16:32,298 --> 02:16:33,340
He can't keep that, by the way.

1527
02:16:33,506 --> 02:16:34,382
He needs to build his own one.

1528
02:16:34,550 --> 02:16:36,260
Helena, we need to go!

1529
02:16:36,719 --> 02:16:38,845
Indy, the window is closing!

1530
02:16:39,013 --> 02:16:40,139
We cannot get stuck here!

1531
02:16:45,853 --> 02:16:47,813
No, no, no! Do not say yes!

1532
02:16:54,944 --> 02:16:55,780
Helena...

1533
02:17:08,501 --> 02:17:09,585
He needs to be in his.

1534
02:17:09,752 --> 02:17:10,711
His work is not done.

1535
02:17:11,086 --> 02:17:12,046
He needs to go home.

1536
02:17:12,212 --> 02:17:13,798
There is medicine at home.

1537
02:17:13,964 --> 02:17:15,757
He cannot die here. He can't.

1538
02:17:17,425 --> 02:17:20,262
Helena, get on the plane.

1539
02:17:22,848 --> 02:17:23,933
I'll be all right.

1540
02:17:25,768 --> 02:17:27,144
No, you won't.

1541
02:17:30,064 --> 02:17:31,816
I need to do this.

1542
02:17:33,067 --> 02:17:33,900
Me too.

1543
02:18:28,539 --> 02:18:29,415
Good morning.

1544
02:18:34,295 --> 02:18:35,671
How's the shoulder?

1545
02:18:38,340 --> 02:18:40,843
Better than my jaw.

1546
02:18:44,471 --> 02:18:45,473
Right.

1547
02:18:47,475 --> 02:18:48,976
You should've let me stay.

1548
02:18:49,852 --> 02:18:51,060
I couldn't do that.

1549
02:19:00,069 --> 02:19:00,988
Why not?

1550
02:19:02,948 --> 02:19:05,493
Well, for starters, you'd have changed
the course of history.

1551
02:19:09,830 --> 02:19:11,623
That's supposed to be a bad thing?

1552
02:19:15,753 --> 02:19:17,546
You're meant to be here, Indy.

1553
02:19:21,425 --> 02:19:22,259
Here.

1554
02:19:27,473 --> 02:19:28,599
For who?

1555
02:19:55,918 --> 02:19:57,503
Marion.

1556
02:19:58,754 --> 02:19:59,797
Hey.

1557
02:20:19,150 --> 02:20:20,067
Teddy.

1558
02:20:21,694 --> 02:20:22,653
Marion.

1559
02:20:25,448 --> 02:20:26,407
What are you doing?

1560
02:20:27,950 --> 02:20:29,118
Putting groceries away.

1561
02:20:31,412 --> 02:20:34,123
There wasn't a scrap of food in this place.

1562
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:37,042
No. Really.

1563
02:20:41,839 --> 02:20:44,049
Someone told me you were back.

1564
02:20:51,515 --> 02:20:53,142
Are you back, Indy?

1565
02:20:54,769 --> 02:20:56,479
It was explosives...

1566
02:20:56,645 --> 02:20:58,773
and Indy was running,
Marion was running...

1567
02:20:58,939 --> 02:21:01,609
and suddenly the plane exploded.

1568
02:21:05,321 --> 02:21:07,364
Indy, you're up and about.

1569
02:21:08,574 --> 02:21:09,950
Yes, I am.

1570
02:21:11,243 --> 02:21:12,077
Yes.

1571
02:21:12,703 --> 02:21:14,747
Why don't we go and get some ice cream, kids?

1572
02:21:14,914 --> 02:21:16,165
But Marion just bought some.

1573
02:21:16,332 --> 02:21:17,416
Oh, I know a better place.

1574
02:21:17,583 --> 02:21:19,794
You can never have too much ice cream,
can you?

1575
02:21:23,672 --> 02:21:24,507
See you later.

1576
02:21:27,718 --> 02:21:31,013
<i>A British tar is a soaring soul</i>

1577
02:21:31,180 --> 02:21:34,016
<i>As free as a mountain bird</i>

1578
02:21:34,183 --> 02:21:36,018
<i>His energetic fist</i>

1579
02:21:36,185 --> 02:21:38,604
<i>Should be ready to resist...</i>

1580
02:21:40,481 --> 02:21:41,774
That looks bad.

1581
02:21:43,275 --> 02:21:44,527
Does it hurt?

1582
02:21:47,071 --> 02:21:48,531
Everything hurts.

1583
02:21:51,408 --> 02:21:53,035
I know how that feels.

1584
02:21:59,125 --> 02:22:01,794
Well, where doesn't it hurt?

1585
02:22:09,927 --> 02:22:10,761
Here.

1586
02:22:12,138 --> 02:22:13,389
It doesn't hurt here.

1587
02:22:21,647 --> 02:22:23,190
And here.

1588
02:22:46,797 --> 02:22:49,175
Jabari, Alia, slow down!

1589
02:22:49,341 --> 02:22:51,469
Helena! Hurry up!

1590
02:22:51,635 --> 02:22:54,305
<i>I scream, you scream...</i>

1591
02:22:54,472 --> 02:22:56,223
Everybody, slow down.

1592
02:22:56,307 --> 02:22:58,768
<i>-I scream, you scream
-I scream, I scream</i>

1593
02:22:58,934 --> 02:23:00,644
<i>We all scream for ice cream!</i>

1594
02:23:00,811 --> 02:23:01,979
Slow down.
