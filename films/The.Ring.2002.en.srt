1
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,448
I hate television.

2
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,575
Gives me headaches.

3
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,205
I heard there's so many magnetic waves
traveling through the air,

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,499
because of TV and telephones,

5
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:45,795
that we're losing like ten times as many
brain cells as we're supposed to.

6
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,215
Like, all the molecules in our heads
are all unstable.

7
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,301
All the companies know about it,
but they're not doing anything about it.

8
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,429
It's a big conspiracy.

9
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,641
You can pick something. I don't care.

10
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,480
You have any idea
how many electro-rays

11
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,941
are traveling through our head
every second?

12
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,568
I got a better one.

13
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,447
Have you heard about this videotape
that kills you when you watch it?

14
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,033
- What kind of tape?
- A tape, a regular tape.

15
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,953
People rent it, I don't know.
You start to play it...

16
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,831
And it's like somebody's nightmare.

17
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,918
Then suddenly, this woman comes on...

18
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,795
Smiling at you, right?

19
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,464
Seeing you...

20
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,299
Through the screen.

21
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,676
And as soon as it's over,

22
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,845
your phone rings.

23
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,806
Someone knows you've watched it.

24
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,934
And what they say is,

25
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,187
"You will die in seven days."

26
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,899
And exactly seven days later...

27
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,734
Who told you that?

28
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:53,070
- Somebody from Revere. I don't...
- Who told you?

29
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,155
What's your problem?

30
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,283
I've watched it.

31
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:01,370
- It's a story, Katie.
- Me and Josh, we saw it last weekend.

32
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,914
I thought you were with your parents.

33
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,791
- I wanted to tell...
- You were with Josh all weekend?

34
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,502
Some of his friends got this place
up in the mountains.

35
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,712
They were trying to record
a football game.

36
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,048
- I guess the reception was so bad...
- What're you talking about?

37
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,132
Listen to me!

38
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:17,094
When we played the tape,
the game wasn't there. It was...

39
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,766
What? What was it?

40
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,394
It was something else.

41
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,691
We thought
it was some kind of sick joke.

42
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,194
And then the phone rang.

43
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,573
It was a week ago.

44
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,910
A week ago tonight.

45
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,415
You're just trying to scare me.

46
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,594
Oh, my God, Katie! Are you okay?

47
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,097
Oh, my...

48
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,599
You freak!

49
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,811
- You totally fell for it!
- No.

50
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:11,858
So did you guys, you know, do anything?

51
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,111
Like what?

52
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,739
Oh, my God, you totally did! You a ho!

53
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,283
- Tell me now!
- No.

54
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,260
There really is a tape?

55
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,745
- This is so lame.
- Wait, don't!

56
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,371
Embry residence.

57
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,058
Hello.

58
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,478
Hi, Mom.

59
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,442
Yeah, that was Becca. My mom says hi.
She's glad you're here.

60
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,486
Ask her where she keeps the Vicodin.

61
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,572
Yeah, we're about to go to sleep.

62
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,408
Okay. Yeah, I will.

63
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,536
Okay! Okay! Yeah, yeah, I will!

64
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,040
No, I won't.

65
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,834
Bye, Mom.

66
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,071
Becca, quit being a bitch.
Where's the remote?

67
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,390
Becca, quit it!

68
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,658
Becca, can you hear me?

69
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,804
Don't tell me what to write!

70
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,681
That asshole's
screaming for my attention

71
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,432
and I'm not gonna give it to him.

72
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,059
I am being objective!

73
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,478
Listen, Harvey, you punctilious prick,

74
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,814
you touch my column,
and I'm coming down there

75
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,023
and poking your eye out

76
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,068
with that little red pencil
you like so much!

77
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,403
Harvey?

78
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:08,863
Shit!

79
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,994
Hey.

80
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,913
Sorry I'm late.

81
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,415
No worries.

82
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,585
I'll wait in the car.

83
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,297
Have you got a moment, Miss Keller?

84
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,631
Sure.

85
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,509
- Call me Rachel.
- Please, sit down.

86
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,596
He certainly is very independent,
isn't he?

87
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,181
Yeah, he sure is.

88
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,141
I never have to tell him to do anything.

89
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,311
Well, if that's a problem, you'd be
the first teacher in history to say so.

90
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,023
- Miss Keller...
- Rachel.

91
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,110
I know that Aidan
recently lost his cousin...

92
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,863
Yes. I'm doing what I can
to find some good daycare.

93
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,158
No, that's not what I meant.
By all means, take your time.

94
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,286
I know they were very close,
Aidan and his cousin.

95
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,622
They spent
a few nights a week together.

96
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,957
Did he talk to you about her death?

97
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,044
Well, like you said,
he's not the talkative type.

98
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,713
That doesn't mean
he has nothing to say.

99
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,426
He knows I'm there.

100
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,428
Yes, I'm sure he does.

101
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,515
But he may be expressing himself in...

102
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,226
Other ways.

103
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,102
I'd like to show you something.

104
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,448
That's his cousin.

105
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,242
That's Katie.

106
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,577
Miss Keller,

107
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,996
I'm bothered by these drawings.

108
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,585
Listen, I appreciate your concern.

109
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,422
But my son lost his best friend
three nights ago.

110
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,425
- He's trying to deal with it.
- I understand, but these pictures...

111
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,346
Are Aidan's way of working it out,
of expressing himself, like you said.

112
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,101
He'll be okay.

113
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,355
You say she died three nights ago.

114
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,899
Yeah, that's right.

115
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,026
Aidan drew these last week.

116
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,219
What?

117
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,056
Nothing.

118
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,402
- Shall we read something?
- I'm kind of tired.

119
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:54,862
Okay.

120
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,574
Sweet dreams.

121
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,745
We don't have enough time.

122
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,584
Oh, honey,
I know I've been working a lot.

123
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,254
And I'm sorry, but I promise you,
I'm gonna make it up to you.

124
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,173
I'm not talking about that.

125
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,343
I'm talking about time before we die.

126
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,971
You have lots of time.

127
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,599
So you know when I'm going to die?

128
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,684
No. No one does.

129
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,937
But I know
you don't have to worry about it.

130
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,192
Katie knew. She told me.

131
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,195
Katie told you she was going to die?

132
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,489
She said she didn't have enough time.

133
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,369
Good night, Rachel.

134
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:02,888
Oh, shit!

135
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,559
Aidan!

136
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,230
God damn it!

137
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,108
Honey, have you seen my black dress?

138
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,652
Aidan?

139
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,822
Have you seen my black...

140
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,448
Dress?

141
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,912
It's a little wrinkled.

142
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,794
It's fine.

143
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,835
Thank you.

144
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,532
Kids don't have strokes.
Unless they're on drugs.

145
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,868
So then, why the closed coffin?

146
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,249
Ruthie.

147
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,919
I'm so sorry.

148
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,555
You all right, Dave?

149
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,768
Yeah, I'm fine.

150
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,270
How are you?

151
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,948
He sleeps all day.

152
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,409
He doesn't move.

153
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,538
It's too much for him.

154
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,918
It doesn't make any sense, Rachel.

155
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:43,382
I spent four hours on the Internet
and I couldn't find one single case

156
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,426
of a 16-year-old girl's heart
just stopping.

157
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,180
I spoke to three different doctors
and not one of them

158
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,351
could tell me exactly
what happened to my daughter.

159
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,441
She was close...

160
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,151
With you.

161
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,820
And Aidan.

162
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,072
But she confided in you.

163
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,242
Yeah, but she never said anything.

164
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,536
Nothing that would explain
what happened.

165
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,746
You could find out.

166
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,792
It's what you do, isn't it? Ask questions?

167
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,714
Rachel, please.

168
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,845
I saw her face.

169
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,607
I knew Becca.

170
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,526
I mean, she was a little intense,
but she wasn't crazy.

171
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,361
They don't put you in booties
and a straightjacket

172
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,196
if you're just freaked out.

173
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,407
Something scared the shit out of her.

174
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,076
Hi.

175
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,623
So who's in the mental hospital?

176
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,709
Becca. Katie's friend.

177
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,796
- Oh, right. She was the one who was...
- There when it happened.

178
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,425
So what do you think
they were doing up there?

179
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,553
Oh, thanks.

180
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,641
I remember I was that age.

181
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:19,561
Me and my girlfriend used to sneak up
to my room, get high.

182
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,231
- Do you think maybe she was into...
- It's not about that.

183
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:25,901
It's about the tape.

184
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,153
Kellen, don't even...

185
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,363
What tape?

186
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,490
The one that kills you when you watch it.

187
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,033
Oh, please!

188
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,410
What was on the tape?

189
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,246
I haven't seen it, obviously.

190
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,332
But Katie told you she saw this tape?

191
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,876
Not Katie. I heard it from her boy...

192
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,088
You heard it from who?

193
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,132
She was dating this guy, Josh.

194
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,259
He goes to Revere.

195
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,179
- It was kind of a secret.
- Kind of?

196
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,264
Where is he? Josh. Is he here?

197
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,016
Josh is dead.

198
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,226
What?

199
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,395
And what happened?

200
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,939
Supposedly he killed himself.

201
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,442
The same night that Katie died.

202
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,192
Aidan...

203
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,694
What are you doing in here?

204
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,699
Come on. We shouldn't be in her room.

205
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,203
It's not her room anymore.

206
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:39,738
"10:00 p.m."

207
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,119
Time of death, Wade.
That's all I want to know.

208
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,664
The name's Katie Embry.
Pull the report, read the time.

209
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,666
No, that's okay, I'll hold.

210
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,336
"Punctilious prick?"

211
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,505
Nice alliteration, huh?

212
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,174
- You're fired.
- No, I'm not.

213
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,425
Yes, you are.

214
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,093
No, I'm not.

215
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,429
I'm cooking too good a story.

216
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,224
- What is it?
- Yeah, I'm still here.

217
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,441
Okay, so what's the time of death?

218
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,574
- Hi, I was wondering...
- Pick a card, any card.

219
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,326
Go ahead.

220
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,246
Put it back.

221
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,331
Don't let me see it.

222
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,422
That your card?

223
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,756
No.

224
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,925
Damn.

225
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,178
I was wondering if you'd remember
someone from a week ago.

226
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:28,888
Was there a problem?

227
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,849
It's my niece.

228
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,393
She sort of ran out on her parents.

229
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:35,979
No.

230
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,524
I have some photos here.
That's her and her friends.

231
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:41,943
I think they stayed here a night or so.

232
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,278
Yeah.

233
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,196
They were in Cabin 12.

234
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,823
They didn't pay.

235
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:50,577
They had a number of complaints.
About the TV mainly.

236
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,204
Reception's never good here.

237
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,791
That's why we bought tape players
for videos.

238
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,794
Quite a selection.

239
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,632
Mostly they're hand-me-downs
left by other guests.

240
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,427
Anyway, they didn't pay.

241
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,597
And kids like that sometimes don't.

242
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,307
Miss?

243
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,726
You know, I'm kind of tired.

244
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,729
I'm thinking I might take a nap
before I drive back.

245
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,482
I'll take Cabin 12.

246
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,412
Hey.

247
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,916
This is your card, right?

248
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:41,795
That's it.

249
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,008
Seven days.

250
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,540
I'm going to school!

251
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,662
What do you think?

252
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,372
Well, it's a pretty cool effect.

253
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,168
What does this have to do
with the tape?

254
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,755
Take my picture.

255
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,055
Are you going to look at me at least?

256
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,187
This the same camera?

257
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,272
No. Scan the rest.

258
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,612
So, what do you think?

259
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,701
Look, I thought you said
this was about a tape.

260
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,795
I'm thinking maybe you shouldn't see it.

261
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,672
No, I should know more about it first.

262
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,510
Well, isn't that why I'm here?
So you can benefit from my wisdom?

263
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,595
Four kids are dead, Noah.

264
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,224
Not from watching a videotape.

265
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,854
Come on, show it to me.

266
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,388
Roll credits.

267
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,600
That was very student film.

268
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,521
I'm sure it's a lot scarier at night.

269
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,156
You going to get that?

270
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,885
So, you been working a lot?

271
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,720
I'm not tired, Noah.

272
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:51,599
- Okay.
- That tape didn't scare you?

273
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:55,311
- No, not really. Sorry.
- Four people are dead.

274
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,979
Yeah. But, as I said,
not from watching...

275
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,523
Four people who watched it.

276
00:30:58,607 --> 00:30:59,982
Come on. We watched it.
We're hanging.

277
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,401
It takes a week.

278
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,071
Right.

279
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,239
I'm just going to go downtown.

280
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,865
I got to pick up
some cameras from this guy.

281
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,784
And then I got to prep this thing
I may do next week.

282
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,868
Noah...

283
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,205
- Would you say that I'm gullible?
- No.

284
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,541
- Easily rattled?
- Definitely not.

285
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,293
You're a little highly-strung maybe.

286
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,462
You ain't much of a dresser.

287
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:24,090
Who made it? Where did it come from?

288
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,887
All right. Make me a copy.
I'll see what I can do.

289
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,186
Thanks.

290
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,107
Yeah.

291
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,218
You sure this is a copy?

292
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,344
Yeah, why?

293
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,390
The numbers are all screwed up.

294
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,645
The same problem got copied, I guess.

295
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,106
That's impossible.

296
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,149
The numbers are the control track.

297
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,859
They're put on the tape
whenever it's recorded.

298
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,737
Which means, theoretically,
there shouldn't be any images.

299
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:53,656
Hey, Noah.

300
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,492
Can you pretend for one minute
that I don't read Video Geek Magazine?

301
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,453
Okay, when you record a tape,

302
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,122
the makeup of the tracks
is like a signature

303
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,625
for whatever did the recording,
like a camcorder, VCR, whatever.

304
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,545
So the control track could tell us
where it came from.

305
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,505
But to not have one...

306
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,090
That's like being born
without fingerprints.

307
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,884
Then how did this get recorded?

308
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:15,720
I don't know.

309
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,472
But I'm going to find out.

310
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,767
Take a look.

311
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:24,729
You should be able to see the camera
here in the reflection.

312
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,981
The angle's straight on, but you don't.

313
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,108
What's that?

314
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,485
Looks like she's walking away,
whoever she is.

315
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,571
No, I mean up there at the top.

316
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:37,283
Oh, no. That's just the tracking.
I can fix that.

317
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,076
What? Sorry.

318
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,120
Wait, go back. There's something there.

319
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,165
- You're right.
- There's more picture.

320
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,542
Hold on.
I'm going to stretch the alignment.

321
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,586
- Yeah, it's working. Okay, keep going.
- It won't go any further.

322
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,795
- No, no, no. Let me do it!
- Wait, wait, wait!

323
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,172
- Come on.
- It won't go any further!

324
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,340
- Get your...
- Let me do it! Shit!

325
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,764
Noah, I picked up the cameras.
They're in really good shape.

326
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,349
Did you see the reprints I did
of that Guatemala stuff?

327
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,351
They came out kind of...

328
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,395
Overexposed.

329
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:10,483
- You working?
- This is a friend, Rachel Keller.

330
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,653
She writes for the PI.
Rachel, this is Beth, my assistant.

331
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,323
Well, I prefer "Partner in crime."

332
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,534
She's a journalism student
at Kirkland, actually.

333
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,537
Well, I'll stay out of your way.
I'm not even here.

334
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,416
Rachel's researching a story.

335
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,461
It's this video hoax.
It's sort of interesting. You know video.

336
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,463
Why don't you come take a look
at this thing with the tracking?

337
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,216
I'm late. I really should go.

338
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,427
- Yeah, but why are you taking the...
- I got to go. Good to meet you.

339
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,852
- You're taking the tape?
- I don't want her to see it.

340
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,647
You don't want her to see it?
What about me seeing it?

341
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:53,359
- You had no problem showing it to me.
- I did have a problem.

342
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,320
- You're angry.
- I'm not angry.

343
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,781
- Oh, no? What are you then?
- In a hurry.

344
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,701
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to get
all worked up

345
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,078
over some high school rumor.

346
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:08,749
What are you thinking?

347
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,836
I'm thinking this is the part where I say

348
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,712
you're a flake, never finishes anything.

349
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,924
Then you say I'm an obsessive bitch,
needs to lighten up.

350
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,218
Then I storm out, all pissed off,

351
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,638
kicking myself for ever thinking
that you could just...

352
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,056
Grow up.

353
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:30,688
So why don't we just
cut to that part right now

354
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,107
and save ourselves a lot of grief?

355
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,695
All right.

356
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:39,405
Bye.

357
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,978
Watch out, missy. Bad luck.
You don't need that.

358
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,260
Becca?

359
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,721
Becca...

360
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:49,016
We're almost there.

361
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,027
Do you remember anything
about that night?

362
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,696
That night with Katie?

363
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,784
Do you remember...

364
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,453
How she died?

365
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,041
Becca?

366
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,845
She told you about a videotape,
didn't she?

367
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,896
She was afraid, wasn't she?

368
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,148
Something was happening to her.

369
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,650
Becca...

370
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,153
How did she die?

371
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,155
Please.

372
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,741
I need to know.

373
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,579
And you will.

374
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,627
She'll show you.

375
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,254
Who?

376
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,172
Who will show me?

377
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,925
Not now.

378
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,102
Four days.

379
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:24,361
Yeah, well, your home VCRs
will give you a tracking window,

380
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:25,821
but they won't let you stretch it.

381
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,240
No point, really,
unless you're talking restoration.

382
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,118
Archives will come in here with these
crummy old tapes sometimes,

383
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,454
tracks totally shot,
servos can't line them up.

384
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,206
But the big box here's a warhorse.
Totally analog,

385
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,500
she'll read to the very edge of your tape.

386
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,753
Just don't force her,
or she'll get pissy with you.

387
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:44,715
Your tracking, your monitor,
your printer, if you need it.

388
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,510
So, what are we watching?
Home movies or something?

389
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,972
I'd really rather watch it alone.

390
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
Really.

391
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,769
Whatever.

392
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:19,208
Come on.

393
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,224
Lighthouse.

394
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:39,311
Shit!

395
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,773
Hello? Somebody?

396
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:50,739
Dang.

397
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,193
Something you needed help with?

398
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,446
Hey, you got a...

399
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:45,627
- Well, this seems to be the lot of it.
- Thank you.

400
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,088
"Moesko Island."

401
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,242
Oh, my God.

402
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,476
"Investigators search for answers
after second horse drowning."

403
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:25,579
Anna Morgan.

404
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,311
"Suffered from hallucinations."

405
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,114
What happened to you, Anna?

406
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:14,878
Pack of Double Lights. Thanks.

407
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:17,631
$15.33.

408
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,429
You're going to die.

409
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,973
My cousin was two packs a day.

410
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,643
Used the patch, never looked back.

411
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,603
All right. Well, I'll keep that in mind.

412
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,898
- Have a nice day.
- You, too.

413
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:25,740
- Hi.
- Sorry I'm late.

414
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:29,494
- No. No problem.
- Everything okay?

415
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:32,456
Oh, yeah. He was an angel.

416
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,709
I went in to tell him that it was bedtime,

417
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:40,046
and he was already under the covers.
And then he read me a bedtime story.

418
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:44,384
He learned the word "conundrum."

419
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:48,096
- Really?
- And then he drew my picture.

420
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:51,516
Well, here you go.

421
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,351
- Thanks.
- Sure.

422
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,676
Hey, Ruthie, it's me.

423
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,471
I'm sorry to call so late,
but I need a favor.

424
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:33,058
I have to go upstate to do this story,
and I need you to watch Aidan for me.

425
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:36,144
Oh, Rachel, I don't know.
How long will you be gone?

426
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:37,854
It's just for two days, I promise.

427
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,940
This isn't the best time for me.

428
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,985
- Rachel? Rachel, are you there?
- Hold on a sec.

429
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:45,654
Sorry.

430
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,115
Rachel,

431
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:50,951
is this about Katie?

432
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,561
Ruthie...

433
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,334
Aidan?

434
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:53,907
No!

435
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,751
Why, baby, why? Why?

436
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:06,378
I couldn't sleep.

437
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,844
Who is she, Rachel?

438
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,446
Leave him alone!

439
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,240
Rachel?

440
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,578
Noah...

441
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,080
Listen to me, Rachel...

442
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,792
I need to talk to you, okay?

443
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,964
I believe you.

444
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,634
Rachel, are you there?

445
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,805
He watched the tape.

446
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,683
Who watched it?

447
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,355
Our son.

448
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,340
You take my picture.

449
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:40,180
I've seen you.

450
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,683
When I'm in the yard at school.

451
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,394
You're there.

452
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,398
Do you wish I was around more?

453
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,900
No.

454
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,986
Do you want to be around more?

455
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,699
- Rachel and I were...
- Young.

456
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,951
Mom's told me that story.

457
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:08,458
The thing is...

458
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:11,127
I don't think I'd make a good father.

459
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,465
Maybe it was because my own was...

460
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,886
Such a disappointment.

461
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:30,730
Thing is, I don't want
anyone else to do it either.

462
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,443
Be your father.

463
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:37,946
It's a conundrum.

464
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,285
Yeah, it is.

465
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:25,201
- Time to go, mister.
- I'm not finished.

466
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,956
Noah said to make one for you.

467
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:40,675
You could almost draw a line
through her life.

468
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:43,970
On one side there's this happy woman

469
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:47,473
who spends her time
with her husband, riding horses.

470
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:52,145
Everything sheltered,
protected and comfortable.

471
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:55,231
Her face, there's light.

472
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:56,941
There's pride.

473
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:58,985
And then one day something happens...

474
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,864
And she takes this hard corner
and the light goes out.

475
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,993
And then she ends up
at Eola County Psychiatric,

476
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,328
all alone.

477
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,496
What happened to her?

478
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,415
I don't know yet.

479
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,668
But I think it has something to do
with the horses.

480
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,587
I think we should go
to the island together.

481
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,422
It's Tuesday, Noah.

482
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,299
I only have one day left.

483
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,092
I need you to go to the hospital
and find out

484
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,427
as much as you can about Anna.

485
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:28,222
The images on the tape
are leading us somewhere.

486
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:31,184
Katie saw them all, too.

487
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,936
I think...

488
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,064
Before you die, you see the ring.

489
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:50,328
Shit!

490
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:52,705
Hey, Rach! Wait!

491
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:48,803
A daughter?

492
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,303
Hey, you.

493
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,604
It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.

494
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:43,649
Easy, boy.

495
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:49,072
That's it.

496
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,955
Hey, boy. I'm not going to hurt you.

497
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,671
It's okay. Calm down.

498
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,885
Somebody!

499
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,020
Jesus Christ.

500
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,567
Somebody help!

501
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,907
Daddy, my horse!

502
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,204
He's going out!

503
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:53,112
I need to see the records
for a patient named Anna Morgan.

504
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,615
Are you a relative?

505
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:57,366
Well, no.

506
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:58,701
I'm sorry, sir.

507
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,871
We're a mental health facility.
Our records are private.

508
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,624
Well, she's been dead 24 years.
I don't think she'll mind.

509
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,960
I'm sorry. It's impossible.

510
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,004
Look...

511
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:13,758
I've seen them before.
I've been up there.

512
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:17,553
Nice try.
The record rooms are downstairs, guy.

513
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:21,641
You win.

514
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:27,480
Jerk-off.

515
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:09,522
You in here, Anna?

516
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,575
Hello?

517
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:02,676
Excuse me, Mr. Morgan.

518
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:04,970
I was wondering if you'd have
a moment to speak with me?

519
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,807
My name's Rachel Keller.
I'm a writer with the Seattle PI.

520
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:09,600
You want to know about the horses.

521
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:14,146
I didn't mean to... It's just...

522
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,898
I wasn't able to find
a number to reach you...

523
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,901
Every now and then,
a writer comes along...

524
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,903
Heard about what happened.

525
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:24,490
What's left to write about, though,
I don't know.

526
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:27,576
I was hoping you had
just a few minutes.

527
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:30,496
Well, work never ends
around here, really.

528
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,915
But I guess I got a few.

529
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,836
So, what is it you're writing, miss?

530
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:39,922
About horses in general
or just those that go strange?

531
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,258
I read you had to put so many down.

532
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:45,261
Most put themselves down.
They drowned.

533
01:02:45,846 --> 01:02:46,887
How'd they get out?

534
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:50,516
They just broke through the fences
and ran to the shore.

535
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:54,687
- So, they went crazy?
- It would seem so, yes.

536
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,691
Or maybe they just sense things
before we do.

537
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,237
So, where are your horses now?

538
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:06,907
I don't breed anymore.

539
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:11,537
I guess you wouldn't.
Not after what happened.

540
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:15,666
That must have been hard.
On both of you.

541
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,335
You and your wife.

542
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:24,717
I'm sorry, miss.
What's your name again?

543
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:29,972
- Rachel.
- Well, Rachel...

544
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:33,225
You want to tell me
what's really on your mind?

545
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:38,898
Do you know what this is?

546
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:44,653
I think it's a message from your wife.

547
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,325
Anna's on this tape.
She's right there in that room.

548
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:52,661
You can see the lighthouse,
the horses...

549
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:58,334
- Where did you get that?
- Shelter Mountain Inn.

550
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:02,171
Is that the only one?

551
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:06,258
I made a copy.

552
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,185
I've got a lot of work to do today.

553
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,605
A lot of acres out there.

554
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:22,441
Minute I think I'm done with one thing...

555
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:27,613
Another thing needs fixing.

556
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:32,701
You don't want to see this tape?
You're not even curious?

557
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:34,370
Curious?

558
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:36,288
No. I don't think so.

559
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,627
- Mr. Morgan...
- I can't help you.

560
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:44,922
Where's your daughter?

561
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,926
- Maybe she could help...
- I don't have a daughter.

562
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:53,389
- Excuse me?
- What is it with reporters?

563
01:04:53,974 --> 01:04:57,977
You take one person's tragedy
and force the world to experience it.

564
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,646
You spread it like sickness.

565
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:03,774
- Mr. Morgan...
- Tell me, miss...

566
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:06,235
What is it you think you know?

567
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:10,948
Then leave it alone.

568
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:35,741
"Anna Morgan's hallucinations."

569
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:38,911
What's wrong with you?

570
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:48,253
"Conceived, '65. Miscarriage, '66.

571
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,839
"Conceived, '66. Miscarriage."

572
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:53,175
Christ, she wouldn't give up.

573
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:32,172
"See Video Record SM0015."

574
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,520
Aidan, it's your mom.

575
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:59,408
- Hi, Mom.
- Honey, the house you drew for me...

576
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,326
Where did you see it?

577
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,912
Did you see it in your head?
Is that why you drew it?

578
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,414
In my head?

579
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:08,500
Aidan, why did you draw that house?

580
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,586
'Cause she told me to.

581
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:11,712
Who?

582
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,672
Who told you to?

583
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:16,842
The little girl.

584
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:22,639
She talks to you?

585
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:24,975
No.

586
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:27,603
She shows me things.

587
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,855
Did she show you the horses?

588
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:33,317
She doesn't like it in the barn.

589
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:36,320
The horses keep her up at night.

590
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:39,823
So she still lives there?

591
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,202
No.

592
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,498
She lives in a dark place now.

593
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:17,110
You're getting a little old
to be crabbing out there, Cal.

594
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:19,738
Your body's about outlived its warranty,
you know.

595
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:22,449
You ain't exactly the catch of the day.

596
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:25,118
- Let's see you catch one better.
- Oh, yeah.

597
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:28,872
Afternoon. I'm Dr. Grasnik.

598
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,708
I think he was here before me.

599
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,877
Darby? Darby's always here.

600
01:09:34,546 --> 01:09:36,255
Aren't you, Darby?

601
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:40,717
He's my son's boy.
Come over on the ferry, did you?

602
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:41,885
Yes.

603
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:45,681
Have you lived here long?

604
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:48,392
Born and raised.
Only doctor on the island.

605
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:50,477
Then you know the Morgans
and their daughter.

606
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:55,774
- Do you know their daughter?
- "Do you know their daughter?"

607
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:01,071
What's this about?

608
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:03,740
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't know how to say this,

609
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:07,744
but I'm seeing things
in my head. Images.

610
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:09,496
And so is my son.

611
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:13,667
My son, that's why I'm here.

612
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:17,880
And somehow, I don't know how, but...

613
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:20,048
It's because of that girl.

614
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:26,805
Haven't heard anybody say that
in a long time.

615
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:34,062
She wanted a child more than anything.
Poor Anna.

616
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:38,317
They tried hard for years,
but sometimes it's just not meant to be.

617
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:40,569
Then one winter they went away.

618
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,905
When they came back,
it was with Samara.

619
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:47,492
Adopted, they said.
Never did say from where.

620
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:50,495
Said the mother
had died of complications.

621
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,873
But they had their baby,
they had their horses,

622
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:54,583
everything was fine.

623
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,544
Until Anna started coming to see me.

624
01:10:58,046 --> 01:11:01,423
Said she was suffering visions.
Seeing things.

625
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,926
Horrible things.

626
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:07,012
Like they'd been burned inside her.

627
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:10,140
That it only happened around Samara.

628
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,851
That the girl put them there.

629
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,647
Were you Samara's doctor, too?

630
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:19,608
Was there anything wrong with her?

631
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,151
You mean, medically?

632
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:23,236
I mean whatever you mean.

633
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:28,867
When Darby there was born,

634
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:33,497
we knew something wasn't right
with him.

635
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,958
But we loved him anyway.

636
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:42,130
Takes work, you know.
Some people have limits.

637
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,218
So what happened to her?

638
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:51,598
I referred them to Eola Psychiatric
on the mainland.

639
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:53,809
I assume she's still there.

640
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:55,477
You don't know?

641
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:58,438
How can you not know?

642
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:03,902
We've been through
a lot of hard years out here.

643
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:06,905
Mean winters...

644
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:09,408
Small hauls, no fish.

645
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,370
And that was long before the horses.

646
01:12:14,122 --> 01:12:18,458
See, when you live on an island,
you catch a cold, it's everybody's cold.

647
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:21,962
No offense, ma'am,
but what the hell does that mean?

648
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:25,215
It means ever since
that girl's been gone,

649
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,134
things have been better.

650
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:32,347
1978.

651
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:34,307
Man, we're really
going back in time here.

652
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:36,184
Yeah, the lady at reception said
it should still be here.

653
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:37,561
Should be.

654
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,604
You say
you're the patient's father, right?

655
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,523
Yep. Richard Morgan, that's me.

656
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:44,609
- What is your secret?
- Diet and exercise, man.

657
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:45,777
No shit!

658
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:47,654
Yeah. That's all it takes.

659
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:50,991
You know, I'm not an idiot.

660
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:53,869
You try and walk out of here with my file

661
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:56,538
and I'll be on you
like white on rice, understand?

662
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:59,041
No, man. I just want to watch it.

663
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:03,503
I'm responsible
for every file tape in here.

664
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:05,213
I have a system.

665
01:13:05,465 --> 01:13:08,216
And I don't want anyone disarranging it.

666
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:11,970
I'd never disarrange...

667
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:15,515
Long as we understand each other.

668
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,561
Okay, now I'm mad.

669
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,022
Does it say who was
the last person to watch it?

670
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,152
Yeah.

671
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,779
It was you.

672
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,240
Come on. Come on!

673
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:37,454
The mobile unit you've called
is not responding

674
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:38,747
or is outside the coverage area.

675
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,290
You piece of shit.

676
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:45,670
Come on, Rachel.

677
01:13:58,518 --> 01:13:59,684
Hello?

678
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:22,791
Mr. Morgan?

679
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:03,850
This is SM0015, Samara Morgan,
hour 14.

680
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:08,855
Be good. Very good.

681
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:12,025
So, what is it that's keeping you awake?

682
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:14,903
You must sleep sometime.

683
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,740
Do you dream about something?

684
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,118
Samara?

685
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:28,875
Let's talk about the pictures.

686
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:32,963
How did you make them?

687
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,842
Samara?

688
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:41,346
How did you make these pictures?

689
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:44,891
I don't

690
01:16:46,394 --> 01:16:47,727
make them.

691
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:52,649
I see them, and then...

692
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:55,110
They just...

693
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,529
Are.

694
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:01,866
Samara, I need you to start telling me
the truth, okay?

695
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,661
Can I see my mommy?

696
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:09,040
No, Samara. Not until we understand
what's wrong with you.

697
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:13,753
- I love my mommy.
- Yes, you do.

698
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:18,675
But you don't want to hurt her anymore,
now, do you?

699
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:21,594
You don't want to hurt anyone.

700
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:26,224
But I do. And I'm sorry.

701
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,394
It won't stop.

702
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,980
Well, that's why you're here.

703
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:34,941
So that I can help you to make it stop.

704
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:38,361
He's going to leave me here.

705
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,989
Who?

706
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:42,824
Daddy.

707
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:45,952
They just want to help you.

708
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,620
Not Daddy.

709
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:51,249
Your daddy loves you.

710
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,419
Daddy loves the horses.

711
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:59,132
He wants me to go away.

712
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:02,844
No, he doesn't.

713
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:06,014
But he doesn't know.

714
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:08,558
He doesn't know what?

715
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:10,769
Samara?

716
01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:18,777
She's never gonna whisper
in my freaking ear ever again!

717
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:21,654
What did you do to her?

718
01:18:26,077 --> 01:18:27,994
She was your daughter!

719
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:34,084
You killed Samara, didn't you?

720
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:35,668
You killed her and when your wife...

721
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:38,463
My wife was not supposed to
have a child!

722
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:48,807
Mr. Morgan...

723
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,727
- What are you doing?
- The whispers...

724
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:55,897
You could hear them all the time.
At night, in your sleep.

725
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:57,690
Even the damn horses.

726
01:18:58,109 --> 01:19:00,819
- Mr. Morgan, come out of there.
- And those pictures...

727
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:04,656
Christ! The things she'd show you.

728
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:06,658
She's still showing them.

729
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:08,660
And she'll never stop.

730
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:11,830
You coming here proves that.

731
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:16,209
Where is she? Please.

732
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,254
I have to stop her.
If I don't, my son will die.

733
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:22,715
Oh, yes. He will.

734
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:26,052
- She never sleeps.
- Wait.

735
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:36,896
No! No!

736
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:40,108
Rachel! It's all right!

737
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:43,486
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

738
01:19:45,573 --> 01:19:46,990
You're okay.

739
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:50,034
You okay?

740
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:00,253
Oh, Jesus.

741
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:16,936
She doesn't like the barn.

742
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:22,108
The horses keep her up at night.

743
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:30,450
"She doesn't like the barn."

744
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:31,910
What?

745
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:35,121
The horses keep her awake.

746
01:21:07,947 --> 01:21:09,197
Samara.

747
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,528
He kept her here.

748
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:53,491
Her mother was going crazy.

749
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:57,161
Morgan blamed the child.

750
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:00,456
So he kept her here.

751
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:04,460
Alone.

752
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:07,213
Not alone.

753
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:39,078
Rachel.

754
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:45,335
There's something under here.

755
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:56,387
It looks like it's etched into the wood.

756
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:02,852
Or burned.

757
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,466
I've seen this tree before.

758
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:35,927
Yeah, it was on the tape.

759
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:37,428
No.

760
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,764
I've been there.

761
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:44,686
Shelter Mountain.

762
01:24:15,509 --> 01:24:19,595
The sun came through the leaves,
lit them up like it was on fire.

763
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:24,225
Right at sunset.

764
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,522
Right when I watched the tape.

765
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:37,447
That was a week ago.

766
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:47,665
We're back to where we started from.

767
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,502
Something led us here.
The tree, the drawing on the wall...

768
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:53,129
It doesn't matter.

769
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:55,965
We're too late.

770
01:24:58,761 --> 01:24:59,969
You have to help him.

771
01:25:00,888 --> 01:25:01,888
What are you talking about?

772
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:03,890
Aidan.

773
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:08,102
It's up to you now. Just use the time
you have and figure something out.

774
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:09,979
We're gonna figure this out
together right now!

775
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:11,189
It's too late, Noah!

776
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:13,566
Stop it! Okay?
There's a reason that we're here.

777
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:14,942
- What?
- I don't know. Okay?

778
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:18,529
But it's something in this room!
It's in this phone!

779
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:21,032
It's in this television!

780
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:23,785
Come on! Call us now, why don't you!

781
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:26,788
Noah...

782
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:29,957
Look.

783
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:12,810
Jesus.

784
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:15,938
How far down do you think it goes?

785
01:27:16,023 --> 01:27:17,732
I can't see anything.

786
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,119
Now we should drop something.

787
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:08,157
You think she's down there?

788
01:28:38,480 --> 01:29:14,015
Rachel!

789
01:29:14,725 --> 01:29:16,017
I'm here!

790
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:18,436
I'm all right.

791
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:20,688
I think.

792
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:23,774
I'll go find something to get you out!

793
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:25,776
Hurry!

794
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:23,667
Noah?

795
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:25,294
Noah!

796
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:34,345
No!

797
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:07,378
Round we go

798
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:12,675
The world is spinning

799
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:17,263
When it stops

800
01:31:17,556 --> 01:31:22,309
It's just beginning

801
01:31:28,066 --> 01:31:30,151
Isn't it beautiful here, Samara?

802
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,198
So peaceful.

803
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:42,288
I know things will get better.

804
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:55,593
All I ever wanted was you.

805
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:39,428
She was still alive.

806
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:19,760
It's okay now.

807
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:22,972
It's okay.

808
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:26,600
Rachel!

809
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:33,065
Rachel, the sun's set!

810
01:33:35,694 --> 01:33:38,904
The sun has set! It's past sunset.
Do you hear me?

811
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:41,657
It's past sunset.

812
01:33:46,705 --> 01:34:00,301
Rachel...

813
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:07,516
Rachel, are you there?

814
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,732
I'm here.

815
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:35,044
They're going to bury her next week.

816
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:39,548
It's over.

817
01:34:47,349 --> 01:34:48,640
You okay?

818
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:53,854
She wanted that child
more than anything in the world.

819
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:57,733
How could she have done that?

820
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:03,989
She just wanted to be heard.

821
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:09,578
Sometimes children

822
01:35:10,747 --> 01:35:13,916
yell or cry or draw pictures.

823
01:35:28,932 --> 01:35:30,641
I want to go home.

824
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:49,243
I can't imagine being stuck down a well
all alone like that.

825
01:35:51,454 --> 01:35:53,622
How long could you survive?

826
01:36:00,296 --> 01:36:01,672
Seven days.

827
01:36:08,555 --> 01:36:10,973
You could survive for seven days.

828
01:37:20,585 --> 01:37:22,920
You just call me sometime?

829
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:25,923
Unless you're renting a movie.

830
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:30,010
Call me tomorrow.

831
01:37:34,724 --> 01:37:36,642
And the day after that.

832
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:19,059
Rachel?

833
01:38:23,398 --> 01:38:25,023
What time is it?

834
01:38:26,109 --> 01:38:30,529
It's either really late or really early,
depending on how you look at it.

835
01:38:32,615 --> 01:38:34,491
Don't you have to be at work?

836
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:37,411
Not today.

837
01:38:42,458 --> 01:38:44,459
What happened to the girl?

838
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:47,004
Samara?

839
01:38:47,714 --> 01:38:49,381
Is that her name?

840
01:38:50,592 --> 01:38:52,509
Is she still in the dark place?

841
01:38:53,261 --> 01:38:54,261
No.

842
01:38:55,388 --> 01:38:57,014
We set her free.

843
01:38:59,309 --> 01:39:00,851
You helped her?

844
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:02,269
Yeah.

845
01:39:03,104 --> 01:39:04,354
Why did you do that?

846
01:39:07,317 --> 01:39:08,442
What's wrong, honey?

847
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:09,860
You weren't supposed to help her.

848
01:39:10,987 --> 01:39:14,698
It's okay now.
She's not going to hurt you.

849
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:15,949
She...

850
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:23,457
Don't you understand, Rachel?

851
01:39:26,419 --> 01:39:29,129
She never sleeps.

852
01:40:25,812 --> 01:40:27,813
Pick up the phone, Noah.

853
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:30,857
Come on, pick up.

854
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:21,950
Come on, Noah!
Pick up the goddamn phone!

855
01:42:27,517 --> 01:42:28,809
Come on!

856
01:44:16,834 --> 01:44:18,460
Go to your room!

857
01:44:18,544 --> 01:44:19,586
Now!

858
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:28,553
What do you want? What do you want?

859
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:31,389
What do you want from me?

860
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:51,576
Why not me?

861
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:56,539
What did I do that he didn't?

862
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:31,366
She just wanted to be heard.

863
01:45:33,703 --> 01:45:35,662
He wants me to go away.

864
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:38,164
My wife was not supposed to
have a child!

865
01:45:38,374 --> 01:45:39,916
All I ever wanted was you.

866
01:45:40,001 --> 01:45:41,418
Don't you understand, Rachel?

867
01:45:41,752 --> 01:45:43,253
But he doesn't know.

868
01:45:43,587 --> 01:45:44,838
She never sleeps.

869
01:45:45,131 --> 01:45:48,925
You take one person's tragedy
and force the world to experience it.

870
01:45:49,719 --> 01:45:51,261
You spread it like sickness.

871
01:45:51,804 --> 01:45:53,555
You don't want to hurt anyone.

872
01:45:54,473 --> 01:45:55,473
But I do.

873
01:45:57,018 --> 01:45:58,518
And I'm sorry.

874
01:46:00,438 --> 01:46:01,938
It won't stop.

875
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:08,319
I made a copy.

876
01:46:11,157 --> 01:46:12,532
Push it in.

877
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:14,451
Play.

878
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:16,494
Push.

879
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:27,047
It's going to keep killing, isn't it?

880
01:46:27,965 --> 01:46:29,632
She'll never stop.

881
01:46:30,676 --> 01:46:31,676
Don't worry, sweetie.

882
01:46:32,887 --> 01:46:35,055
You're going to be okay.

883
01:46:40,728 --> 01:46:43,521
What about the person we show it to?

884
01:46:44,482 --> 01:46:46,149
What happens to them?
