1
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,583
-We're coming to the end.
-The end of what?

2
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,875
The end of the movie.
The end of the shoot.

3
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,000
-There's always the next one.
-Are you listening?

4
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:54,500
I started getting dry eyeballs.
From nowhere.

5
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:58,875
Like there was grit or something
constantly in them.

6
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,667
{\an8}And there was an oculist here.
The one who does the lenses.

7
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,916
{\an8}Hey, sorry.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
{\an8}Skip needs to do a check.
He thinks it might have slipped.

9
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,708
Silk shirt's causing problems.

10
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:10,166
I'm not going to let this be a thing.
I said, "What do I need to do?"

11
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,250
Could you say something, please, Jay?

12
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,458
-I love you.
-A little bit more, please.

13
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:18,833
{\an8}Ten, nine, eight, seven.
Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday.

14
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,916
-Jay, you're the best.
-There must be somebody better.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,333
We're seeing the whole
wide world on this one, folks.

16
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,000
He gave me these drops,
and it totally went away.

17
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,666
Disappeared, the dryness.

18
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,375
You've gotta be ahead of the game.
Two steps ahead.

19
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,250
I just made a decision. I'm not gonna...

20
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:37,375
Right now, your anxiety's at a ten,
so of course you feel like quitting.

21
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,125
Because I'm your dad, that's how I know.

22
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,792
Your hair feels great.
Have you been using that conditioner?

23
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:45,167
-This is the worst part, the anticipation.
-Let me check your pant leg.

24
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,792
I'm sorry to interrupt, Hailey would
like to see you in the bloodier coat.

25
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,667
Did you have the peppers
or the ravioli? I should've had ravioli.

26
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,875
I just had my shake.

27
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,916
Who'd want to be young?

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,166
-Find a place to hide, people!
-Can we do it with the dog?

29
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,291
Jay wants the dog. Can we bring the dog?

30
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,167
That dog makes more money than any of us.

31
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,041
Can we see a light drizzle?

32
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,125
That's a drizzle? It's more like a deluge.

33
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,916
Believe me, that's the drizzle.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I have watched
you bloom throughout this tournament.

35
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,458
And you really found your second serve.

36
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:18,375
You think Coco doesn't get butterflies?
Doesn't dread? Doesn't call her dad?

37
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,708
-This is me in the bloodier coat.
-Bloodier is better.

38
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:21,958
-I got your espresso.
-Thanks.

39
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,958
Don't let me have
more than a sip after 4.

40
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,042
You wouldn't know.
I see coffee, I drink it.

41
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,042
...it'll be the last movie for all of us.

42
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,167
They'll turn out the lights,
and that'll be that.

43
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,666
Of course you should
have called me, puppy.

44
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,375
Don't beat yourself up about that.

45
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,500
You're just getting yourself
from all angles now.

46
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,041
I had a double in the 5K.

47
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,500
Guilt is a secondary emotion.

48
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,000
-Thanks, Clay.
-Always a pleasure, Jay.

49
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,833
I did not have any bread
today, no. That was your brother.

50
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,000
What are you thinking?
We got a couple good ones.

51
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,542
It should just be how it happens.
Let what happens happen.

52
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,833
-You want to do another?
-Let's see what happens.

53
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,500
Okay, quiet, please!
This will be for a take.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,083
-Roll sound.
-Rolling.

55
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,541
Sound speed.

56
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,666
-Quiet, please.
-138 Echo, take 11.

57
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,250
Hold on, sweetheart.
I'm just gonna watch this take.

58
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,791
And... action!

59
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,458
I don't want to be here anymore, Jerry.

60
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,791
I want to leave this party.

61
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,458
You know... He's in too soon.
Can we go again?

62
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,917
-Delay Jerry just a beat.
-Cut!

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,125
-Don't cut. Keep rolling, please.
-Keep rolling.

64
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,792
More of the anchovy paste on my...

65
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,666
-Room quiet, please.
-Thanks.

66
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,958
-Okay. All right.
-Guys, I'm rolling.

67
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,125
Action.

68
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,458
I don't want to be here anymore, Jerry.

69
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,125
I want to leave the party.

70
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,416
In a way...

71
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,291
I already died.

72
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,666
I'm lucky.

73
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:57,541
My time passed while I was still alive.

74
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,250
I got to see it end before it ended.

75
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,458
That's a crazy thing. When you die...

76
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,125
everything you thought you were...

77
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,250
isn't true.

78
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,500
You're a good dog.

79
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,000
And... cut. Great!

80
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,833
-Can we go again?
-Really?

81
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,167
I'd like another one.
I mean, I think I can do it better.

82
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,791
Quiet, please!

83
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,416
Different. I don't know.

84
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,583
-But if you're happy...
-Very happy.

85
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,291
-Okay.
-If you have an idea...

86
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,541
I thought I had an idea.
But you're happy?

87
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,208
I'm ecstatic.
But of course you can have one more.

88
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,333
-You feel good?
-I really do.

89
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,458
-Okay.
-I liked a couple of the early ones too.

90
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,500
Cool.

91
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,416
Good?

92
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,208
Good.

93
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,833
And that is a picture wrap on Jay Kelly!

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,541
And a wrap on <i>Eight Men From Now!</i>

95
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,833
Well done, man. It's gonna be a good one.

96
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,111
It's a total honor.
Thank you for trusting me.

97
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,875
We made the tennis finals, Vivienne.
That's something to celebrate.

98
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:26,833
So get your rest, because
the Greenbergs are tough opponents.

99
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:30,583
But my money is on you and me, kiddo.

100
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,791
I love you, Vivi.

101
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,791
-José! Pops! You guys are awesome!
-Thank you so much. Thank you.

102
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,375
-Skip, you guys never get the credit.
-That means the world.

103
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,083
-Let me call you back, sweetheart.
-I appreciate the gift.

104
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,041
Okay, guys. Guys.

105
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,083
Everybody, thank you all so much.
You did a great job.

106
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,958
A couple of timely reminders.
We got the Omega event

107
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,250
tomorrow morning, 11 a.m. pick up.
Candy will...

108
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,333
Will be there at 9.

109
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,458
-Were you watching?
-Yes.

110
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,167
-You didn't say anything.
-You get annoyed if I give an opinion.

111
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,083
If you don't say anything,
then I assume you hated it.

112
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,750
It was brilliant,
I think take seven was the one.

113
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,916
Why seven?

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,125
-I'm not getting into this.
-Into what?

115
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,458
You always get this way
whenever we wrap a movie.

116
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,416
Emotional, and then you blame me.

117
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,208
Maybe it was seven.
I guess they could always cut to the dog.

118
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,833
That dog was great.

119
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,750
What's it like, Jay,
to experience your own death?

120
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,583
-I didn't really die.
-No, I know that.

121
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,750
But how do you perform
something you've never done?

122
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,500
-Pretend, Candy.
-I don't know if I'd want that ability.

123
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,541
Guys, thank you all for working so hard
and being so great.

124
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,083
-Couldn't do it without you.
-Thank you for having us, Jay.

125
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,208
-You're the best.
-I am the best.

126
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Why is there always a slice of cheesecake
in every room I'm in?

127
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,958
It's in your rider, along with the fruit
and all the different kinds of water.

128
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,166
How is it in my rider
when I don't even like cheesecake?

129
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,250
You once said you liked it.

130
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,458
-I never did.
-You did. You just don't remember.

131
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,500
If anything, my rider should say
"no cheesecake." Never cheesecake.

132
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:51,250
And... dinner with Daisy tomorrow.

133
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,750
-Chef Mario is doing the special tamales.
-Oh, good.

134
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:58,416
Also, Antonio from
the Tuscan Arts Festival called again.

135
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,250
-They need an answer about the tribute.
-I said no.

136
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,208
And I told them no.

137
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,583
-But they're very persistent.
-And it's still no.

138
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,042
I just mention it
because they're quite reputable.

139
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,625
Not on your life.

140
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,167
-It was gonna be tight anyways.
-No tributes. Ever.

141
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,333
We start shooting
in a couple weeks. Okay.

142
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,208
That was the point when I realized
I was more intelligent than you.

143
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,500
What does that mean?

144
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,166
-I know more than you.
-Do you?

145
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,750
-No, you don't.
-Yes, I do.

146
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,458
-About what?
-About everything.

147
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,208
What is the capital of Croatia?

148
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,291
I barely know
the fucking capital of California.

149
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,791
Who was Agamemnon's wife?

150
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:54,000
See, now, these are just facts.
Anybody can know facts.

151
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,750
I know more about emotional stuff.
You have to live a life for that.

152
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,666
I'm more emotionally intelligent.

153
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,701
Don't you want me to be
smarter than you?

154
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,375
-Isn't that the whole point of this?
-Yeah.

155
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,541
-Don't you think it's a bit early?
-I can't help the timing.

156
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,666
-It looks good.
-Oh, yeah?

157
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,583
You can't tell.

158
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,958
Yeah, she did a good job.
She left a little gray in.

159
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,416
-They usually make it too black.
-It's not...

160
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,458
No, no, it's just right.

161
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,750
You should go fully gray,
if you want my opinion.

162
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,833
Yeah, but not just yet.

163
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:27,583
All right, well, I'm going to go
meet Moses and Rio.

164
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,666
I love you.

165
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:34,083
Hey, aren't we having dinner tonight?
Mario's doing the tamales.

166
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,375
Did we say that?

167
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,458
All right.

168
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:45,666
Go on. Be with your friends.
There'll be other dinners.

169
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,208
I wrapped this last one.
I start the Louis Brothers movie

170
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,500
right here on the lots.
I'll be around for the summer.

171
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,583
I'm going to Europe with Rio and Moses
and some friends. I told you that.

172
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,458
-I thought that was in July.
-No, it was always June.

173
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,750
I'm leaving on Saturday for Paris,
and we're making our way to Tuscany.

174
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,208
Saturday? I mean... That's...

175
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,500
Saturday. That's... It's too soon.

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,291
I got two weeks off.
We won't have had time to hang out.

177
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:17,546
-This is your last summer.
-That's why I want to see my friends.

178
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,583
It'll be so lonely here without you.

179
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:24,500
-No, it won't. You're never alone.
-Really? I think I'm always alone.

180
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,040
-Thanks, Silvano.
-You're welcome.

181
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,000
Eh. All right.

182
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,541
Mm.

183
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,250
How about if I joined?

184
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,875
Well, we're going to this really great
jazz festival in Paris

185
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,375
which has a lot of people,
so you can't do that.

186
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,958
And then we're taking a train
with no first class to Pienza,

187
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,666
which you also can't do.
And we're sleeping in tents.

188
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,970
Which... I mean, come on.

189
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,958
-I basically grew up in a tent.
-But not anymore.

190
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,208
Well, the muscle memory's still there.

191
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,125
Okay, well, that's good. I gotta go.

192
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,333
-Hey, Ronnie.
-Daisy.

193
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,875
Vivienne's been posting about the tennis.
You guys are adorable.

194
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,500
Oh. We made the finals.
We're so excited.

195
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,083
You got a friend now, Dad.

196
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,500
Want a tamale?

197
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,541
Peter Schneider died.

198
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,958
Fuck, I gotta call him.

199
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,958
No, I just found out and came here.

200
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,208
He died.

201
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,041
Really?

202
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,458
I'm sorry.

203
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,708
I know how much you loved him.

204
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,166
His message is still on my phone.

205
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,708
When was the last time you saw him?

206
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,041
I don't know. Maybe six months ago.

207
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,458
Sweetheart,
I'm going to make you a sandwich.

208
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,375
<i>I'm glad to see you, Peter.
I've missed you.</i>

209
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,583
Where do you keep the knives?

210
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,625
That magnet thing
over by the cutting board.

211
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,125
-Oh, yes.
-Barbara, I'm sorry.

212
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,375
-We made a mess after you already cleaned.
-That's okay, Jay.

213
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,208
You know, Pop...

214
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,000
Lately, I feel like
my life doesn't really...

215
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,875
feel real.

216
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,166
Maybe a better way of putting it is

217
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,254
that my life doesn't really...

218
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,291
feel real.

219
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,875
I heard about your breakup
with the hand model.

220
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,458
-Breakups are like deaths, aren't they?
-Mm.

221
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,166
-Mayonnaise?
-Refrigerator, on the shelf.

222
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,291
Oh, yes.

223
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,041
How are the girls?

224
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,708
Daisy graduates this spring,

225
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,333
and then she's at Johns Hopkins

226
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,791
for biochemistry, if you can believe it.

227
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,041
-She's a brilliant girl.
-Then...

228
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,416
Jess is in San Diego.

229
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,666
That's...

230
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,166
I don't know what to do there.

231
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,375
You'll figure it out.
Do you have olive oil?

232
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,500
Yep, over there.

233
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,666
I've been thinking a lot
about <i>Cranberry Street.</i>

234
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,458
We had such fun shooting that, didn't we?

235
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,458
We were always laughing.

236
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,375
D'you know it's the 35th anniversary
coming up?

237
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,958
Jess was born the next year.
That's how I know that.

238
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,833
All my memories are movies.

239
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,541
That's what movies are for us.

240
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,416
Pieces of time.

241
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Pieces of time.

242
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,416
-Do you have pickles?
-In the pantry.

243
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,625
I think.

244
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,583
Oh, yes, here they are.

245
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,708
-Check the expiration.
-Pickles don't expire, my love.

246
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,625
They definitely do.

247
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,541
They're fine.

248
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,333
Thirty-five years. Is that possible?

249
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,750
It's all possible, son.

250
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,375
There was such magic on that one.

251
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,916
I was spoiled.
I thought they'd all be like that.

252
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,583
-They're not.
-So few are.

253
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,958
I'm glad you've been thinking about us.

254
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,625
I have a picture
I'd like for us to do together.

255
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,750
It's the prostitute picture
I told you about.

256
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,750
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yes.

257
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:56,916
Well, I'm shooting a movie now,
and then I'm doing one right after.

258
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Do you know those kids,
the Louis Brothers?

259
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,125
They're big fans of yours.

260
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,500
I didn't take to their picture.
Too much MTV cutting.

261
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,667
-I don't know how much I'd be available.
-I can wait for you, darling.

262
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,750
Peter, I told you it's just not for me.

263
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,750
I did a rewrite
with my assistant, Shelley.

264
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,917
I think you met her
at that idiot's premiere.

265
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,208
We made it more contemporary.
They have cell phones.

266
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,541
It's not a territory
that I want to explore.

267
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,417
I thought I'd ask Daphne to play the wife.

268
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,625
-She is retired.
-If you could just attach yourself.

269
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,458
My lawyer says we need a name.

270
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,291
I can't do that.

271
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,748
I'll be honest with you, son.

272
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,166
I need the money.

273
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,417
-I'll give you the money.
-But I need to make another picture.

274
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,458
I want to do two, right in a row.

275
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,708
Back-to-back.

276
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,250
You know what dear Truffaut said.

277
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,750
"Sometimes quantity is impressive."

278
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,208
Art is personal, Pop. You know that.

279
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,166
I understand.

280
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,513
But if you could just lend your name.

281
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,416
I can't.

282
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,041
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,125
It's delicious.

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,333
Pickles don't expire.

285
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,166
My dad was never there.

286
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,666
In the '70s and '80s,
he was always on movie sets.

287
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,958
And when he started to struggle,

288
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,625
after he made a couple of
what many of you in Hollywood would call

289
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,750
"bombs" or "turkeys,"

290
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,250
or, forgive me, I'm not in the business.
I don't know the language.

291
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:36,291
"Flops" that are now considered
cult classics by Gen Z.

292
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:41,083
After the industry turned its back on him
after his third bankruptcy,

293
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,417
after he was forced to sell
his beloved mansion,

294
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,125
Casa del Oro in Bel Air,

295
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,291
and move into the one-bedroom in Encino,

296
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,291
he was always trying to raise money,

297
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,166
dreaming of the next picture.

298
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,375
As he lay dying,
he turned to me, and he said,

299
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,000
"I know how the movie ends."

300
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,458
"It's about love."

301
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,583
You don't remember me, do you?

302
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,375
-Of course I do.
-No, you don't.

303
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,458
-Yes, I do.
-Where do you know me from?

304
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:16,041
I was in the only movie
he directed on horseback.

305
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,500
I love you both.
I think I have to go rescue Jay.

306
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,416
How long do you think...

307
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,583
-I got beach cleanup at 3.
-We'll get you there.

308
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,375
-If I'm late, it won't count.
-Just take the car.

309
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,833
Not surprisingly, it was his worst film.

310
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,583
-You have no idea who I am.
-I do. Yes.

311
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't believe you.

312
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,458
Thanks for coming, Jay.

313
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,375
I'm so sorry, Nathan.

314
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:41,708
You know, Dad always said
how lucky he was to have found you.

315
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:42,718
He changed my life.

316
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,166
He thought the same about you.

317
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,153
He wanted you to have
one of his neckerchiefs.

318
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,291
I am glad we came.
It makes it all more real.

319
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,500
-None of this feels real.
-I know.

320
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:59,041
Death is always so surprising,
particularly in LA.

321
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,163
I like the neckerchief.

322
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,750
-You want it?
-Thank you.

323
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,125
Why didn't I just do
another movie for him?

324
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,292
You're feeling this way
because you're a good person.

325
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,708
Just lend my name.
'Cause he just wanted my name.

326
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,541
-Jay?
-Hey, man.

327
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,416
-Tim?
-Yeah.

328
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,166
Timothy. Hey.

329
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,541
Hey. Don't worry,
I'm-I'm not stalking you.

330
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,125
No, no, no, it's...

331
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,875
-Hey, we just did the...
-Yeah.

332
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,625
-We lost a great one there.
-Yeah, it's sad.

333
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,250
-He was really special.
-We're just busy all the time,

334
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,041
and then people are dying.

335
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,875
Ron, this is Timothy, my old roommate.

336
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,083
We were in acting class together.
My old budd-ay.

337
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,541
-Budd-ay.
-Yes, yes. Tim. Nice to see you.

338
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,458
Ron Sukenick, Jay's manager and friend.

339
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,333
-Yeah, I've told you about him.
-Heard a lot about you.

340
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,541
Really? Really, you have?

341
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,500
Oh, well, all good, I hope.

342
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,875
'Cause we were some
pretty bad boys back in the day.

343
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,125
Yeah.

344
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,125
-How have you been?
-I'm good, you know.

345
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,041
Living the life, you know.
How are you doing?

346
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,208
Well, that's a stupid question.
You're doing great.

347
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,458
I'm all right. I'm all right, you know.

348
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,291
It's good to see you.

349
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,750
-You too.
-Yeah.

350
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:08,666
Man.

351
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,333
Okay, well...

352
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,583
See you, man.

353
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,129
-All right.
-Nice to see you.

354
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,848
I'm not following you.
I'm parked over here.

355
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,292
Maybe we should
grab a coffee or something sometime.

356
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,083
Oh, man, that would be great, you know.
And how would I...

357
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,208
We... Maybe I'll contact
your office or something?

358
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,125
-Just call me.
-I'll get the message if you...

359
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,666
-There you go.
-Oh. Yeah.

360
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay. Great.

361
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,500
And if it's not cool,
don't feel obligated.

362
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,500
Actually, I have time now.

363
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,791
Oh, that's great. Hey.

364
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,083
Uh, do you remember Chez Jay
by the water?

365
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,041
Sure, yeah, okay. I'll meet you there.

366
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,208
Budd-ay!

367
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,417
-Do I follow you?
-It's all right, Silvano, you can go home.

368
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,667
We're okay with this guy?

369
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,667
He's an old friend.
I haven't seen him in years.

370
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,375
-There will be people there.
-It's all right.

371
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,083
I remember people. I'll see you tomorrow.

372
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,000
No, you won't. Remember?
I have the tennis finals with Vivi.

373
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,458
-That's right. Good luck.
-Take it easy on the drinks.

374
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,958
-Yeah, I will.
-'Cause it's an emotional day.

375
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,125
Stick to beer.

376
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,542
<i>Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo</i>

377
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,833
My guru says that when someone is dying

378
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:36,000
and getting closer
to the spiritual world... Thank you.

379
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,500
That they get less afraid of death.

380
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,916
You got a guru, man. That's great.

381
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,833
Death, it becomes less real.

382
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:44,916
And...

383
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:50,208
of course power and success
become completely unreal,

384
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,000
because they're no longer relevant.

385
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,916
But like Peter said, all that's left...

386
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,041
is love.

387
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,208
-That was beautiful.
-I know.

388
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,291
Okay, I'm doing it.

389
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,500
-Hi. Could I get a picture?
-Oh, yeah, sure.

390
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,388
-Okay, thank you.
-Yeah, here we go.

391
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,750
-Got it?
-Yep.

392
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,791
Love to get your guru's number.

393
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,375
Oh, yeah, he's magic. He's best by text.

394
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,708
This place is so great.

395
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,833
I haven't been here since...

396
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,333
since we were in class.

397
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,172
-Do you see anyone from class?
-No.

398
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,958
-No. Do you?
-Oh, yeah. We have reunions.

399
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,833
I think that you're
the only one that still works.

400
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,041
Oh, Cindy does a lot of voiceovers.

401
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,250
But you were the one we all looked up to.

402
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,083
-Oh, no, no, no.
-Oh, yeah.

403
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,458
You were the best of all of us.
You were method.

404
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,541
I wasn't method.

405
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,625
-You were method.
-I was method light.

406
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,791
You could do anything.
I could watch you do anything.

407
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,833
I could watch you read this menu.

408
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:48,583
Do that thing. Do it.
Read the menu. Come on.

409
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:55,000
Okay, all right. All right.
This is no emotional choice.

410
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,041
Uh, truffle parmesan fries,

411
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:01,375
Brussels sprouts with balsamic
honey glaze and bacon, 12 dollars.

412
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,625
Wedge of iceberg lettuce, shrimp cocktail,

413
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,125
calamari with lemon aioli sauce,
15 dollars.

414
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,083
Hey...

415
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,583
-Now do it with an emotional choice.
-I don't know, man.

416
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,583
I don't do this anymore.
I'm a child therapist.

417
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,166
Do it.

418
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,125
Jay Kelly stare.

419
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,416
And action!

420
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,958
Okay. All right.

421
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,083
Let's see. What would Larry say?

422
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:40,625
Okay.

423
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,458
Okay, I'm remembering something
that's really important to me.

424
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,625
I can see him.

425
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,250
I can... I can hear him.
I can talk through it.

426
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,166
Truffle parmesan fries.

427
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,208
Brussels sprouts
with balsamic honey glaze and bacon.

428
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,625
Twelve dollars.

429
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:33,416
A wedge of iceberg lettuce
and shrimp cocktail.

430
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,833
Calamari with lemon aioli sauce
is 15 dollars.

431
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,208
That's what method acting is.

432
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,458
That's amazing. Oh, my God.

433
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:01,375
No, my problem was I was not ambitious.

434
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:05,958
It's such a hard business.
I wouldn't wish it on anybody.

435
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,333
I keep thinking I might just stop.

436
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,958
No, come on.
You've done all right, Jay Kelly.

437
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,500
I made two bad decisions.

438
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,750
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

439
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:20,458
You know I passed on the original <i>90210?</i>
I was doing <i>Hamlet</i> in Louisville.

440
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,833
Ah, that's cool.
I haven't done a play in...

441
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,416
oh, since high school.
What was the other one?

442
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,875
I let you come to that audition.

443
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:40,125
But my boys got to see me waiting
outside the school gates every day.

444
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,625
I gotta think that counts for something.

445
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,416
For sure it does.
It counts for everything. Everything.

446
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:51,291
Hey, I'm sorry.
I read about your divorces,

447
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,083
and your girls, they must be
full-grown people by now.

448
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,166
Daisy starts school in the fall.

449
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,458
Thankfully, she doesn't
give a shit about acting.

450
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:01,375
But... I'm freaking out, I...

451
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,333
Thinking about her leaving.

452
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,125
I feel like I missed it.

453
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,125
Hey...

454
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,625
Tragedy of parenting.

455
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:14,458
We are only successful
once we've made ourselves irrelevant.

456
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:17,625
-That's so sad.
-Come on.

457
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:21,416
You've made the right choices for you.

458
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:25,167
You make movies, man.
That's what the world wants from you.

459
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,125
My world is much smaller.

460
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:31,000
I take the dogs to the park.
Being with my family and my patients.

461
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,458
Nice to see you, Tim.

462
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,416
And it's nice to talk about those times.

463
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:50,375
Nice to be in touch with you and with...

464
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,291
also that guy.

465
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,375
Guy I was.

466
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,208
Is it?

467
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,583
Uh, yeah.

468
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,361
I don't think you want
to meet that guy again.

469
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,583
What?

470
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,250
I'm gonna be honest with you.
I can't stand you.

471
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,958
You kind of stole my life.

472
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,166
I didn't steal anything from you.

473
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,500
Really? You stole my job.
And you stole my girlfriend.

474
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,208
At 23, I didn't have much more than that.

475
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:33,125
And now, every time I pick up a magazine,
I'm forced to read about Jay Kelly

476
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:35,833
and his amazing origin story.

477
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:39,708
How he accompanied his friend
to an audition for Peter Schneider,

478
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:42,375
only he got the part. Imagine that.

479
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:46,791
But they never wonder about the friend.
The guy he took it from.

480
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,583
I got Peter to cast you.

481
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,625
I was a glorified extra.

482
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:52,416
-I had one line.
-I gotta go.

483
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
-If people knew what I do about you...
-I gotta get up early.

484
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,833
-I'll get the bill.
-I got it already.

485
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:59,791
-Hey, can you sign this for me?
-Oh, yeah, sorry.

486
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,958
Hey, don't worry.
I'm not gonna tell people.

487
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,666
I'm not that kind of guy.

488
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,583
You know, I don't actually know
what kind of a guy you are.

489
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:12,375
You're not that important to me.

490
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:15,750
You're important to other people
en masse maybe, but not to me.

491
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,833
Sorry you feel that way.
I always had fond thoughts of you.

492
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:27,587
I'm not the only one who feels this.
Your daughter agrees with me.

493
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:28,791
Daisy?

494
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:31,416
Jessica.

495
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,083
We're Facebook friends.

496
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:35,167
I recommended the therapist
for her in San Diego.

497
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,416
That guy's a charl...
Don't talk to Jessica.

498
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,083
You're gonna tell me
who to be friends with?

499
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,583
I'm not gonna tell you
who to be friends with.

500
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,129
She calls you an empty vessel.

501
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,458
Maybe she's right.

502
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,916
Is there a person in there?

503
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,458
Maybe you...

504
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,458
don't actually exist.

505
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,041
My car's here. Let's just leave it.

506
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:18,514
I've always had this fantasy
of hitting you.

507
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,541
I should have done this years ago.

508
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:30,791
Oh!

509
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:35,708
Come on.

510
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,166
Come on.

511
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,500
You were never gonna get that part.

512
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:43,625
Never.

513
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,041
You got this, puppy.

514
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,208
I know. I'm just getting
that feeling I feel.

515
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:52,458
That's fine. Now say goodbye to that.

516
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,250
I'm trying.

517
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:04,041
Sorry, Liz, can Ron call you back?
Vivienne's serving for the match.

518
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,000
-Out.
-I know.

519
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:09,000
-I'm just saying it's out.
-But Michelle, it's the way you said it.

520
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,875
-He can call you after the match.
-Sorry, Dad.

521
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:13,375
-I heard Mom and I got distracted.
-I did too. I understand.

522
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,708
Sweetheart, you can't talk
while we're playing.

523
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:18,125
I know. I'm sorry. Liz says it's urgent.

524
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,833
Dad, do you know about ghosts?

525
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:24,416
Hold on, Vivienne gets a do-over
because she was distracted.

526
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,375
-Dad, I don't want a do-over.
-Ron.

527
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:27,667
What rules are you playing by?

528
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,333
Gordon, this isn't the French Open.
Give the girl another serve.

529
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:34,250
I give Vivienne another serve,
then why not give Michelle another serve?

530
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:37,208
Hell, I'd like another serve too,
while we're at it. Let chaos reign.

531
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:38,292
-Ron.
-I don't want another serve.

532
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:41,375
It's not another because
that one shouldn't have happened.

533
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:44,208
Uh... Right.

534
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:46,500
-Yes?
-<i>You don't pick up your phone?</i>

535
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:49,208
-We're serving for the match.
<i>-We need you now, Ron.</i>

536
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,833
-Dad.
-I can't come now.

537
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:52,500
-We're in the middle of a game.
<i>-It's Jay.</i>

538
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:55,166
-Dad.
-Jay knows I have this tournament.

539
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,166
Jay's dropping out of the movie
that he starts in a week.

540
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,250
The Louis Brothers movie?

541
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:01,916
-Dad.
-David, don't put your mouth on the fence.

542
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,958
I like the taste of it.

543
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:07,250
He's not dropping out. This is Jay when
he wraps a movie. He always does this.

544
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,875
Believe me, Ron. It's bad.

545
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:11,291
It's really, really bad.

546
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,791
Ron.

547
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,000
-Today.
-He got a work call.

548
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,291
Dad.

549
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:17,916
Dad.

550
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:20,458
Dad.

551
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:25,416
Fine, I'm coming.

552
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,583
-Do you know about ghosts, Dad?
-I do, David.

553
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:33,041
Ghosts are the spirits of dead people
who come back to Earth

554
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:35,750
-if they have unfinished business.
-Ad out. It's our serve.

555
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:38,583
So change in plans.
We got to suspend the game.

556
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:40,208
-Suspend the game?
-No. No way, Ron.

557
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,667
Something's come up. I have to go.

558
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,041
-Where?
-To Jay's.

559
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,791
You suspend, you forfeit.

560
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,541
-Says who, Gordon?
-The tournament rules.

561
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,833
-What if it was raining?
-It's not raining, Ron.

562
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:51,379
-It's not raining, Dad.
-Ron.

563
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:55,041
I feel good. We can win.

564
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:57,083
I know. I have to go.

565
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,166
They're waiting for you.

566
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,375
Thank God.

567
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,458
-What happened yesterday?
-Nothing.

568
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:18,708
We went to Peter's memorial.
He bumped into an old friend.

569
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:20,917
-They went out for drinks.
-Something happened.

570
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,250
If he pulls out, he'll be in breach.

571
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:24,208
You're not making
quesadillas by any chance?

572
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:25,625
I... I can.

573
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:28,166
-Where's Jay?
-In his bedroom.

574
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,125
-He is packing.
-Packing for what?

575
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:32,666
I don't know.

576
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,250
Quitting would be financially devastating.

577
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,208
Devastating on a reputation level.

578
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:37,958
His box office is not what it was.

579
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:40,000
-Nobody's is.
-He's not 25 anymore.

580
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:42,583
-He's not 55 anymore.
-Okay, now the studio's calling.

581
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:44,416
You done? Everybody done?

582
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,833
No one's in breach. Jay's doing the movie.

583
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:49,208
-That's not what he's saying.
-Well, now I'm here.

584
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:52,166
Well, then find out
why he has a black eye.

585
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,916
He has a black eye?

586
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:56,625
Jay?

587
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,125
-Hey, brother.
-Hey, puppy.

588
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:05,667
-What's the packing?
-You just come from the game?

589
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,875
How'd you and Vivienne do?

590
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:10,416
-Well, we were up 5-4 and serving...
-I do too many movies.

591
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,250
-...but it's fine. What's the packing?
-You think I do too many movies?

592
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,833
I think you do just the right amount.

593
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:17,458
-You think I do too many movies?
-You do work a lot.

594
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,000
See? Barbara tells me the truth.

595
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,708
-What happened last night?
-You can't have too much underwear. Hup!

596
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,792
-How'd you get the black eye?
-I'll tell you on the plane.

597
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:26,958
What plane?

598
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:29,375
The plane that I booked.
We're leaving in 1.

599
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:31,125
-Where are we going?
-Meg, where are we going?

600
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:32,958
-France.
-France.

601
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,000
France?

602
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,416
I spoke
to Daisy's friend Rio's mom, Claire,

603
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,875
Rio uses her mom's credit card
so Claire can see the charges online.

604
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:41,166
Of course she can.

605
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,875
Daisy and her friends
are currently in Paris

606
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:45,750
and due to leave for Italy
after the jazz festival on Tuesday.

607
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:48,708
Right. You kids and your computers.
France.

608
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:51,875
-We have a fitting on Monday.
-Not if we're in Paris, we don't.

609
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:54,791
Both Louis brothers are gonna be there.
Marvin and Yusuf.

610
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:58,416
If you need a couple days to
clear your head, I'll tell the studio...

611
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,333
Tell them that I'm joining Daisy
and her friends

612
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:05,666
at a jazz festival in Paris,
and then we are catching a train to Italy.

613
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:10,458
And you're tracking her
through her friend's mother's credit card.

614
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:15,041
It's my last chance to spend time with her
before she's gone forever.

615
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:18,041
I'm fairly certain Daisy doesn't want you

616
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:20,583
following her around Europe
with your entourage.

617
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:24,750
I am the Dior ambassador,
so there's every reason to be in Paris.

618
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:28,041
And then I'm receiving that tribute
in Tuscany.

619
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:29,958
I said no to the tribute. You said no.

620
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,958
-I told them never.
-Call and tell them yes.

621
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:34,708
Listen, take a few days,

622
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:36,958
drive up the coast,

623
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:39,875
order that Pinot
you liked at the Post Ranch.

624
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:41,708
Remember the towels?

625
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:47,208
What did that even mean?

626
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:50,208
I do...

627
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:53,750
-How about I push the fitting to Tuesday?
-Listen.

628
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:56,083
If you don't want to come, I'll go alone.

629
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:59,125
You, on your own, wandering through Europe

630
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,166
is like a little gazelle
alone in the Serengeti.

631
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,333
But not a gazelle. A cocker spaniel.

632
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:09,333
Well, this cocker spaniel
will take his chances.

633
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:31,041
Today, Daisy and her friends
were at the Louvre, Café de Flore,

634
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:33,625
a flea market, and they're staying
at a youth hostel in the 11th.

635
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,000
Now we're cooking.

636
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:37,500
After we land,
we can surprise her at the jazz festival.

637
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:38,583
Perfect.

638
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:41,542
What do you mean, they're giving
the tribute to someone else?

639
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:44,333
Some history.
When Jay passed on the tribute,

640
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:46,416
I got them to offer it to Ben Alcock.

641
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,750
You gave Jay's tribute
to another one of your clients?

642
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:53,041
Somebody had to take it, and it's a good
piece of architecture for Ben.

643
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,166
Fuck a duck. Does Jay know about this?

644
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,708
I spoke to Antonio.
They're gonna do two tributes.

645
00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:59,583
But currently, there's only one trophy.

646
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:03,208
I'm missing, like, three junkets,
a <i>Vanity Fair</i> cover shoot

647
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:04,958
and Justin's little league whatever

648
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:07,292
-for this cluster fuck.
-I know. But it's Jay.

649
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:10,333
-Why does he have a black eye, Ron?
-We're getting to that.

650
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:13,083
Uh-huh.
This is why I could never marry you.

651
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:14,666
Why, because I'm loyal?

652
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,666
No. Because you enable.

653
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,708
<i>We're on the road to Paris</i>

654
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,875
Oh, man, now we have
to listen to him play the piano.

655
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:24,875
<i>We're going to Paris by plane</i>

656
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,125
Sing it, Ronnie!

657
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:29,458
<i>An adventure to the place</i>

658
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,833
<i>Where...</i>

659
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:33,166
-I don't know the words.
-Come on, Ronnie.

660
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,708
Justin's on the B team. It's so sad.

661
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:43,208
You guys, he doesn't know where to run.
It's so sad.

662
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,000
Look.

663
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:47,083
He's really bad at baseball.

664
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:51,666
-Should I take a half or a whole?
-What's the dosage?

665
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:55,958
-You forget your glasses?
-I left in a hurry.

666
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:58,375
Can't say goodbye to David
or he has a meltdown.

667
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:00,750
The therapist said
I should say goodbye anyway

668
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:01,833
so he knows I'm leaving.

669
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:03,833
-He'll be okay. He's five.
-They block it.

670
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,833
He's five, but I probably
should have said goodbye.

671
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:09,958
Take a whole. Otherwise, you'll stress out
and end up waking me up.

672
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,917
So, what this man
on the podcast was saying

673
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,250
is that we're always, always every age.

674
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,583
-Like, literally?
-Well, I don't know literally.

675
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:18,125
Yeah, I'll take a whole.

676
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:21,500
So when I'm 10, I'm also 30, and also 80.

677
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:22,833
And vice versa.

678
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:24,916
Why do you have a black eye, puppy?

679
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:27,125
I'll tell you when we get to France.

680
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,541
But it's nothing
I need to know now, right?

681
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,750
Are you running
to something or from something?

682
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:35,250
-Yes.
-When I remember kindergarten,

683
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:37,250
I'm my age now, right?

684
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,382
How would I know
how you remember yourself?

685
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:42,166
<i>What does it feel like to be famous?</i>

686
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,750
<i>It doesn't feel like anything,
as far as I know.</i>

687
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:55,750
You talk about fame and success,
and this sunlit life and happiness.

688
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:00,875
You talk about me
as if I'm some kind of a king.

689
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:08,041
But your words are just...
sweetness that disappears in your mouth...

690
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,750
Okay, Jay, can you stop there?

691
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,375
What did you feel just then?

692
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:15,750
I felt conceited. Successful.

693
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:18,875
-A star.
-You want to be a star?

694
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,083
I mean...

695
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:23,500
Yeah, sure.

696
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,208
Go on. What else?

697
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:30,916
Enjoying patronizing a young girl.

698
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,083
Thinking I'm a king.

699
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,708
Did that seem powerful, kingly, to you?

700
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:38,095
Looked like a lot of posturing.

701
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,500
How old are you, Jay?

702
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,500
Twenty-three.

703
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:48,166
I'm not interested in seeing you
try to be a famous writer

704
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,666
in pre-revolutionary Russia.

705
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,542
I want to see the hungover kid
who just got off the bus from Kentucky...

706
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:56,333
who's trying to impress
all the cute girls in the class.

707
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:59,041
Basically, just be myself?

708
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:01,416
Do you know how hard it is to be yourself?

709
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,916
Uh-huh.

710
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,792
If you're lucky enough
to act professionally

711
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:06,375
you'll be lying for a living.

712
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,583
The better you lie,
the more truthful you'll seem,

713
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,875
and the more successful you'll be.

714
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:15,250
That's confusing shit for a young man
who doesn't tend towards introspection.

715
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:20,083
You say you want to be a star.

716
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:21,791
Well, I've known a few of those.

717
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:24,625
That's a whole other layer of head fuck.

718
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,458
Now you gotta act twice.

719
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:32,041
Once when you play the part,
and then again when you play yourself.

720
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:37,500
You have to really want that.

721
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:41,458
-I do.
-I do.

722
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:45,000
-Hey, Tim.
-Yeah?

723
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,166
Wanna have a go?

724
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:48,125
Sure.

725
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:57,791
Show 'em how to do it.

726
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:06,381
What does it feel like to be famous?

727
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,771
I don't feel like anything,
as far as I know.

728
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:15,625
You talk about fame and success,
and this sunlit life and happiness.

729
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:18,541
You talk about me
as if I'm some kind of a king.

730
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:20,916
But your words are like a sweetness

731
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,750
that disappears
in your mouth in an instant.

732
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:25,833
I see nothing especially lovely about it.

733
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:28,333
I must go at once and begin writing again.

734
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:30,583
-Tim's having a panic attack.
-Why?

735
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,916
I have a huge audition
for Peter Schneider.

736
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,458
-Dude, that's amazing.
-Tim hates auditions.

737
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:38,208
-I am the worst auditioner.
-I've barely ever gotten an audition.

738
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,333
-It's so not a test of talent.
-It's a test of something.

739
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:42,375
Your talent will shine through.
It always does.

740
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:43,916
Go with him, Jay.

741
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:46,166
You're a calming influence.

742
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,708
Come by the bar after. Free drinks.

743
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:51,166
We will.

744
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:10,750
"I used to want to die.
I'd imagine my funeral."

745
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:13,041
I think he's from the sticks.

746
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,625
"All the pretty girls crying."

747
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:17,708
Then he goes on about the sky
and the stars.

748
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:21,916
He's too poetic for a hick kid.
He'd be more like...

749
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:24,610
"There are too many girls I ain't laid.

750
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:27,250
Dede Duffy, for one."

751
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,375
I don't know, um...

752
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,291
Shit like, "I might even grow more."

753
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:33,750
"There's so many things
I ain't done yet, I don't...

754
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,882
I don't have the vocabulary to list them."

755
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:39,292
-That's better. You should say that.
-I can't mess with their script.

756
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:40,875
You're gonna do great in there.

757
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:43,166
I just get so fucking nervous
at these things.

758
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:45,500
Well, look at this.

759
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,625
{\an8}It's a sign. You're gonna
get this, buddy, I can feel it.

760
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:49,708
Thanks, buddy.

761
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:53,708
Eat it, for good luck.

762
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:55,125
-What?
-Come on. Just a corner.

763
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,125
-Harness his powers.
-Stop it, man. You're freaking me out.

764
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:00,208
-Tim Galligan.
-Uh, yeah.

765
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:02,583
Will you read with me?

766
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:05,041
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

767
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,500
-Hi.
-Thank you.

768
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:12,666
Thanks.

769
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:16,750
-Uh, who are you here to read?
-To read with my friend.

770
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:18,833
If that's okay.

771
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:20,791
Yeah.

772
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:22,583
Thanks.

773
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,041
-I'll get you some sides.
-Oh, thanks.

774
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,541
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

775
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:41,504
What's your beef, Tilly?

776
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,875
-I ain't got no beef.
-Yeah? But you got that look.

777
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:49,000
That line in your forehead
that goes from here to here.

778
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:51,625
I used to want to die.

779
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:54,875
I'd imagine my funeral.

780
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:57,041
All the pretty girls crying.

781
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,375
But I don't want to die, now.

782
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:03,208
I haven't seen enough.

783
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:09,000
I never really looked at these trees.
And the sky.

784
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:11,750
-But now that...
-Thank you very much.

785
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:15,125
-There's more. I didn't finish.
-It's fine. Thank you.

786
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:18,208
Thank you, Timothy.
Thank you so much. Very nicely done.

787
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,262
Would it be cool if I read too?

788
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:26,708
No, I'm sorry.

789
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,742
-If you're not on the appointment sheet...
-Yes, sweetheart, that would be fine.

790
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,583
I mean, if that's okay.

791
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,541
Uh, yeah.

792
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:46,791
What's your beef, Tilly?

793
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,916
-I ain't got no beef.
-Yeah? You got that look.

794
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:56,666
That line in your forehead
that goes from here to here.

795
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:59,041
I used to want to die.

796
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,666
I'd imagine my funeral.

797
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,416
All the pretty girls crying.

798
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:09,958
But I don't want to die now.

799
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:12,250
I haven't seen enough.

800
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,500
There's too many girls I ain't laid.
Dede Duffy, for one.

801
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:21,416
Hell, I might even grow more.

802
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,583
There's so many things I ain't done.

803
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:26,083
I don't have the vocabulary to list them.

804
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,333
And I've only been as far as Archer City.
But I... I don't need to see Paris,

805
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:34,875
or Rome, or one of them places
they got kings.

806
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:36,958
I'm the king here.

807
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,916
I'm the king of this dust cloud.

808
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,458
I'm-I'm the king of my Coca-Cola.

809
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:48,791
I'm the king of Cranberry Street.

810
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:50,875
Thank you.

811
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:57,583
Would it trouble you
to read another scene?

812
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,250
I'd love to.

813
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,083
I'm sorry about changing the lines,
by the way...

814
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,750
No, dear, we liked it very much.

815
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:11,208
Thank you.

816
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:14,458
Yeah, okay.

817
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,791
No, let's just...

818
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:28,666
Does that hurt?

819
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:30,500
No, it's okay.

820
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:32,250
It's fine.

821
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:35,291
You'd never know.

822
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:08,708
My father used to say,

823
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:11,458
"The first person you meet
when you get off a plane is you."

824
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:14,958
-Well, it should be the greeter.
-Remember the last time we were in Paris?

825
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:18,208
The Chanel show? It was in silence
out of respect for the war.

826
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:20,333
I remember Gucci, but that was very loud.

827
00:43:20,416 --> 00:43:21,500
Maybe it was for peace.

828
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:23,833
Thank you so much, Antonio.

829
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:26,541
-They're blowing a second trophy for Jay.
-Great.

830
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:29,292
We arrived in Paris,
and we'll be heading your way tomorrow.

831
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:30,583
Just getting all my texts.

832
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:34,250
According to Rio's mom, Daisy bought
tickets for a 10 o'clock train to Italy.

833
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:36,870
-They're not doing the jazz thing?
-Apparently not.

834
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:39,187
All right, better head
straight to the train.

835
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:42,333
Flag on the play!
We're catching a train to Italy.

836
00:43:42,416 --> 00:43:43,500
-A train?
-Hold on.

837
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,666
We're literally standing next to a plane.

838
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,500
-Why did we fly to Paris then?
-We're coming, but by train.

839
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:49,458
Oh, no.

840
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:53,958
I booked a job for this afternoon.
I'm giving Emmanuel Macron a haircut.

841
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:57,125
-Can you cancel?
-He's my first president.

842
00:43:57,625 --> 00:43:59,625
-Oh, my God. So, yeah...
-10 o'clock.

843
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:01,000
We'll be on the 10 o'clock.

844
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:04,333
Are you fucking kidding me?
I can't put Jay Kelly on a train.

845
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:07,583
You're right, Antonio.
It's the most romantic way to travel.

846
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:10,791
There should be some sort
of official car or something maybe.

847
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:13,791
With a seal, or... I think there's...

848
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:44,166
I'm an atheist
who supports the established church.

849
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,000
I approve of everything about it but God.

850
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:50,416
But if there were no God,
life would be absurd.

851
00:44:50,916 --> 00:44:51,916
Well, exactly.

852
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:55,458
Fuck. Is that Jay Kelly?

853
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:58,375
Thank you.
All right, <i>garçons,</i> that's great.

854
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:00,042
If he signs one, it'll be a thousand.

855
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:02,125
-Just get him on the train.
-You're going to have a trophy.

856
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:04,917
-So you needn't worry.
-Was there ever not going to be a trophy?

857
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,708
That's what I do. I fix things
so you don't have to know about them.

858
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,583
If I don't have to know,
why are you telling me?

859
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:13,833
Because we were late with the acceptance,
and they gave Ben Alcock the award.

860
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:15,542
-There was only...
-You gave Ben my tribute?

861
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,791
-You said no, puppy!
-Then I said yes.

862
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:19,333
I would never say this to Ben.

863
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,625
This stays in the cone,
but you're the first choice.

864
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:23,875
You're the headliner.
You know that, puppy.

865
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:26,041
I'm so confused talking to you right now.

866
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:28,291
I can't believe
I'm catching shit for this.

867
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:30,375
Daisy! Hey!

868
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:32,333
No.

869
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,125
No, no, no. <i>Ce n'est pas</i> Jay Kelly.

870
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:38,125
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

871
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:40,916
Seat 48.
That doesn't sound like first class.

872
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,041
It isn't.

873
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:44,333
We're putting Jay Kelly in seat 48?

874
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:46,250
You tell me.
There were no first class tickets.

875
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:49,042
Maybe no first class at all.
I don't know. They all speak French here.

876
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,583
We have Jay Kelly
the movie actor here with us.

877
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,083
Do you have a private area?

878
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,666
But...

879
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:59,458
Fifty days after Easter.
Very busy holiday for the French.

880
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:02,792
I don't know who to be mad at, but
I'm finding myself being mad at you, Ron.

881
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:04,875
Be mad at me, Liz.
The train was my idea.

882
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:07,250
That's the problem.
I'm not allowed to be mad at you.

883
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:09,458
According to Claire,
Rio got a chai latte

884
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:12,458
at the Starbucks
at Gare de Lyon 45 minutes ago.

885
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,417
You don't go
to a train station for coffee.

886
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,833
I mean, it would be weird.

887
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:03,333
Jay Kelly.

888
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:05,250
Do you think he's fallen on hard times?

889
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:06,875
It's research for a part.

890
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:09,958
Sorry, speak louder. I'm on a French train
on a French holiday...

891
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:11,833
I'll have him there Monday morning.

892
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:13,833
I don't know, the <i>Fête</i> fucking <i>Nationale.</i>

893
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:16,625
Well, then move the fitting
to the first day of the shoot.

894
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,750
Wait, what? Say that last part again?

895
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:22,208
Can you hear me?
It's 50 days from Easter here, I'm sorry.

896
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:23,958
One more time. I want to get this right.

897
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:27,000
We're playing three-dimensional...
four-dimensional chess here.

898
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:29,667
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-I know that's not what Jay says.

899
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,666
It's what I say. I'll get him back.

900
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,708
It's bad.

901
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:36,250
-Hold on. Let me get somewhere...
-Let me call you back.

902
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:37,333
Just put him through.

903
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:40,000
I can't believe
he's actually on this train with us.

904
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:42,208
-Are you real?
-I believe so. Yes.

905
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:44,750
And will you be using
the same bathroom as us?

906
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:46,500
I'll try to remember to put the seat down.

907
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:48,000
Nice, regular guy.

908
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:50,166
-He's a good egg.
-A real double-yolker.

909
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:52,583
I read that that he's never
the seducer in his films.

910
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:54,708
I'm sorry. There's so many people here.

911
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:57,291
I haven't been on a train in 20 years.

912
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,875
-Thirty, maybe.
-A subway.

913
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,875
I can't tell you the last time
I was on a subway.

914
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:03,250
-Oh, the Kozak picture.
-Right, the chase scene.

915
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:06,000
It was on a stage,
but the dimensions were very accurate.

916
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:09,208
We saw you're being honored
at a prestigious Tuscan Arts Festival.

917
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:10,958
Aren't you too young
to be having a tribute?

918
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:13,750
You're very kind, but I don't know
how many more movies I have in me.

919
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:16,042
-At least one more.
-I'd like to have a tribute in Italy.

920
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:18,083
Clive, they don't give tributes
to computer programmers

921
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:19,500
in Italy or anywhere.

922
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:22,667
I expect you'll get all dressed up
and invite all your friends and family.

923
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,708
That's what I'd do, anyway, so...

924
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:27,416
Clive's right. It's your career.
Let's do it up.

925
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,166
Invite your kids. Invite your dad.

926
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,875
-My dad?
-Well, I know, but why not?

927
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:33,916
My kids. I don't know about my dad.

928
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:37,250
He's your dad.
He's not gonna be here forever.

929
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,541
Okay.

930
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,125
All right, but you call him.

931
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:42,964
We can send him a plane if he wants.

932
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:44,875
-Done.
-All right.

933
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:46,750
Oh, my...

934
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:51,750
When I look at you, I see my whole life.

935
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:53,458
I talked to Rich at the studio.

936
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:55,541
-They'll push the fitting.
-Alan called.

937
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:03,833
Jay was in a bar fight.

938
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:06,041
He broke a child therapist's nose.

939
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:08,167
-He broke a child what?
-Did you know this?

940
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,542
Did he say anything about this?

941
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:12,125
-I wanted it very badly.
-No.

942
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:13,250
Do you like being famous?

943
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:16,541
You must have such
a wonderful sunlit life. You're so happy.

944
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:18,833
I think it'd be terrible being famous.

945
00:49:18,916 --> 00:49:21,000
Everyone looking at you,
talking about you.

946
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,833
-It's like being crazy, isn't it?
-Yes.

947
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:25,696
Clearly doesn't help with travel.
Packed in with us plebs.

948
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,291
So what do you all do?
Where are you all going?

949
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:32,708
Milan.

950
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:34,542
-Farm equipment.
-My father was in farm equipment.

951
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:36,958
I go to Pisa. I'm a fireman.

952
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:38,916
-I played a fireman.
-Florence!

953
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,875
We work in the Vatican.

954
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:43,291
Explain what is happening.

955
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:46,000
My thoughts are formulating
in real time here, Liz.

956
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:49,125
-We're just on a girls' trip.
-We're going to get shagged!

957
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:50,916
Computers. Wedding.

958
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,541
Life coach. Also wedding.

959
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:56,235
-Remember the last time we were in Paris?
-I don't want to talk about it.

960
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,500
'Cause we never did...

961
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:02,291
talk about it.

962
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:06,208
Twenty years ago,
I left you up the Eiffel Tower.

963
00:50:07,041 --> 00:50:10,500
Nineteen years ago.
I don't want to talk about it.

964
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:12,750
I looked you up. You're 60.

965
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:14,833
-Yes.
-You can't get old.

966
00:50:14,916 --> 00:50:17,833
-If you're getting old, that means I am.
-I'll stop if you will.

967
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:19,416
Deal!

968
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:23,750
-Do you want some peanuts?
-Sure, sure!

969
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:26,750
What do you say to people
who say you only play yourself?

970
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:29,077
Do you know
how difficult it is to be yourself?

971
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:30,541
You try it.

972
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:38,250
You know, I'm having a tribute
in Tuscany on Saturday.

973
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:42,250
And you all should come.
All of you. Yeah!

974
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:44,500
Yes, just talk
to my publicist Liz right there.

975
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,583
-What time, Jay?
-Sorry.

976
00:50:48,375 --> 00:50:50,041
Do you have any regrets?

977
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:51,791
-What's your name?
-Phoebe.

978
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:54,666
You're a tough one, Phoebe.

979
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:58,125
I'll see you all in Tuscany!

980
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:04,458
<i>Arrivederci!</i>

981
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:08,208
Everyone is so nice.
People are so nice.

982
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:10,833
By the way, these are the best peanuts
I've ever had. Try one.

983
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:12,791
It's a good peanut. A European peanut.

984
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:14,792
I didn't offer you one
because I know about your allergy.

985
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:17,167
That's right.
My throat will close, and I will die.

986
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,958
How can I play people
when I don't see people?

987
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:21,375
Don't touch people?

988
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:23,041
Don't touch people.

989
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:25,083
So, puppy,
you know those times you say,

990
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:27,541
"Don't tell me
unless I really need to know"?

991
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:29,167
This isn't one of those times...

992
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:32,518
Why didn't you tell us you punched
a child therapist in a bar fight?

993
00:51:35,041 --> 00:51:37,708
-I didn't think he'd...
-Sue? He's suing.

994
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:39,167
I know it's difficult to be honest...

995
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,417
You have to tell us everything,
or we can't do our jobs.

996
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,250
...who love you no matter what.
More difficult.

997
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,042
-Why are you saying that?
-We do. We love him.

998
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:46,833
You love him. I work for him.

999
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,541
You know I adore you.

1000
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:52,791
But when the press gets ahold of this,
we need a counter-narrative.

1001
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:56,041
He hit you first?
Is that how you got the black eye?

1002
00:51:56,125 --> 00:52:00,000
'Cause "Jay Kelly defends himself from
crazed stalker" sounds a whole lot better

1003
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,333
than "Jay Kelly beats up
defenseless child therapist."

1004
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:04,958
-That's not what happened.
-Well, how would we know that?

1005
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:07,083
If I've made my last movie,
I'm all right with that.

1006
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,166
-I had a good run.
-You don't mean that.

1007
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:13,083
You broke his nose.
They're claiming this, from Alan.

1008
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:17,083
"Multiple fractures needing surgery, plus
permanent reduction in sense of smell..."

1009
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:18,500
He says I stole his life.

1010
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:22,958
"...and potential deformity, can result
in compensation up to $100,000,000."

1011
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:41,708
Jay Kelly.

1012
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,875
Jay Kelly. Jay.

1013
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:53,375
Jay Kelly.

1014
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:57,166
Jay.

1015
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:02,875
Kelly.

1016
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:05,291
Come on! Quickly! We're going to miss it!

1017
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:07,250
-Hurry up!
-Daisy, I'm coming.

1018
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:08,375
Jay Kelly.

1019
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:11,166
Jay Kelly.

1020
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,625
Gary Cooper.

1021
00:53:14,916 --> 00:53:16,166
Cary Grant.

1022
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,125
Jay Kelly.

1023
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:20,083
Clark Gable.

1024
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:22,791
Jay Kelly.

1025
00:53:24,916 --> 00:53:25,875
Robert De Niro.

1026
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:30,458
Jay Kelly.

1027
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:33,541
Jay Kelly.

1028
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:42,125
Bye, honey. Bye, Mommy,
see you. Have a good weekend.

1029
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:47,625
I can't believe you drove here
from LA by yourself.

1030
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:50,125
I wanted to see you in your life.

1031
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:53,083
I've been in San Diego for almost a year.

1032
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:56,041
Well, my last movie went long.

1033
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:58,958
And then I had this vodka ad in Greece,

1034
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:01,875
-so I'm lucky to have a weekend.
-I know you're busy.

1035
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:05,416
I jumped in the truck
and I drove all the way down here.

1036
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:07,416
So, can you, like...

1037
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:11,833
At this point, can you just
go into a gas station alone?

1038
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:16,250
Yeah, I do self-serve, and then
I just put a baseball cap over my eyes.

1039
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:17,553
What about having to pee?

1040
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:19,083
Side of the road.

1041
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:20,458
God, Dad.

1042
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:25,416
I love seeing you with those kids.

1043
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,166
They adore you.

1044
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,958
Well, I finally found
what I really want to do.

1045
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:33,833
It took a minute, God knows.
You know, acting really fucked me up.

1046
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:36,750
It's really insecure-making.
I don't know how you do it.

1047
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:39,625
I'm insecure.

1048
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:42,458
No, but you always had it.

1049
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:44,542
Even when you were little,
and those shows you would do

1050
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:46,416
in the backyard with your sister.

1051
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,750
"It's... Kelly and Kelly."

1052
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:51,666
No, it was "Kelly and Kel-ly."

1053
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:57,000
I'm just so happy for you.

1054
00:54:57,666 --> 00:54:59,791
Listen, if I could help out with the rent

1055
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:02,000
-or support you...
-No, that's okay, Dad.

1056
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:04,540
I'm glad you're here, though.

1057
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:07,041
You wanna go for a drive?

1058
00:55:07,541 --> 00:55:09,333
It's Theo's birthday next week,
by the way.

1059
00:55:09,416 --> 00:55:10,416
No, I know.

1060
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:12,583
You don't have to remind me.

1061
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:15,250
Right, you have people
who do that for you.

1062
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:17,083
No, I know it's the 24th.

1063
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:19,750
I got him a pony
that's the actual size of a pony,

1064
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:21,291
but it's stuffed.

1065
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:22,791
Oh, he'll love that.

1066
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:25,333
Where are we going?

1067
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:28,958
-I've been seeing a therapist, and...
-Hm.

1068
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:31,541
He's become a very important
part of my life.

1069
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,708
I made an appointment
for both of us with Carter.

1070
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:40,583
Carter's the...

1071
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:48,875
I'm hungry. Why don't we stop, get a bite
and just talk, just the two of us?

1072
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:52,333
This is why I didn't tell you.

1073
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:56,916
Because I knew
you wouldn't want to do it.

1074
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:06,250
This is very important to me.

1075
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:17,208
I'm sorry about the shades.

1076
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:20,291
I have a retinal disorder.

1077
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,125
So I'm very sensitive to bright light.

1078
00:56:24,208 --> 00:56:26,208
I tell him it makes him mysterious.

1079
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:29,083
You should be the one
with the dark glasses.

1080
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:31,875
When it's sunny, yeah.

1081
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:36,291
Do you surf?

1082
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:39,208
A little bit. I'm not very good.

1083
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,458
I'm guessing that you do.

1084
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:44,291
Mm. Every day, until I broke my femur.

1085
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:46,750
-Then I got my psychology degree.
-I'm sorry.

1086
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:50,458
But... I guess good?

1087
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,416
Yeah, a door and a window, right?

1088
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,958
-Yeah.
-Well, thank you for coming.

1089
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:57,500
It's very brave.

1090
00:56:58,750 --> 00:56:59,583
Okay.

1091
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:02,544
Jessie and I have been doing
a lot of work these past weeks.

1092
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:06,083
And Jessie wrote you a letter.

1093
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:07,791
It's from her ten-year-old self.

1094
00:57:09,583 --> 00:57:10,803
She'd like me to read it.

1095
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:13,000
Why don't you read it?

1096
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:15,125
Because I can't get
through it without sobbing,

1097
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:17,416
so we decided that Carter should read it.

1098
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,333
Oh.

1099
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:20,875
Okay, it's... If you...

1100
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:22,333
"Dear Jay,"

1101
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:26,792
-When you abandoned me..."
-Hold on, I didn't abandon you.

1102
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:29,333
-That's your mother talking.
-Try not to comment until I finish.

1103
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:30,917
I left her. I didn't leave you.

1104
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,917
-I was with her.
-Just because I wasn't there

1105
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,917
doesn't mean I stopped being your father.

1106
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,500
Jessie's told me a bit about
your relationship with your own father.

1107
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:40,083
I'm not like my father.

1108
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:45,166
My father's a rageful, bitter egomaniac.

1109
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:48,166
Perhaps your determination
not to be like him

1110
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:51,291
took precedence
over being a father yourself.

1111
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:54,708
Keep reading.

1112
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:02,000
"You say you always want to be with me."

1113
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,933
But your actions
aren't speaking the way your words are.

1114
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,041
My worst day
was when my babysitter rented

1115
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:11,291
that movie you did with Daphne Spender.

1116
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:14,458
She couldn't believe I had never seen it.

1117
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:16,125
And in it...

1118
00:58:19,125 --> 00:58:20,875
you were this great father...

1119
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,806
and you were so sweet
with the little boy...

1120
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:28,333
and with Daphne.

1121
00:58:29,416 --> 00:58:31,083
I cried and cried.

1122
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,083
"It was like you had a happy family."

1123
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:37,916
Can't do it. Can't do it.

1124
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,500
-I'm not finished.
-You're not gonna hear the whole letter?

1125
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,500
Not if Carter reads it, no.

1126
00:58:42,583 --> 00:58:45,375
I knew that you would
find a way to make this about you.

1127
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:47,708
-Carter said you would.
-Carter is crying in there.

1128
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:49,583
I find it interesting
that you're not crying.

1129
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:53,125
Tell him the best way
to make an audience cry is to not cry.

1130
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:56,379
Do you know how I know that
you didn't want to spend time with me?

1131
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:02,083
Because you didn't spend time with me.

1132
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,041
She's in the cafe car.

1133
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:40,000
Explain to me, Ron.
If he doesn't care, why should we?

1134
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:43,500
Liz, of course he cares. This is just
how he's managing his feelings.

1135
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:45,916
"They're so nice."
Of course they're nice.

1136
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,042
You've walked off a movie screen.
You think they're like this with everyone?

1137
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:50,583
They do seem like a nice group.

1138
00:59:50,666 --> 00:59:53,166
We're in second class
on a French train to nowhere,

1139
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,541
taking care of an infant.

1140
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:56,166
Worse, an infant who hit a guy.

1141
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,333
We've known him for 30 years.

1142
00:59:58,416 --> 01:00:00,166
We clearly don't know Jay.

1143
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:02,541
And who knows what else is out there?

1144
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:04,667
Whatever hillbilly shit
he did in Kentucky.

1145
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,416
It can spiral.

1146
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,583
It was different when we were young.
It was fun. Jay was our baby.

1147
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:15,166
-We're gonna handle this.
-Acting out at 60 is a bad look.

1148
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:18,875
We're gonna get him to the tribute.
He's going to feel the love.

1149
01:00:18,958 --> 01:00:22,083
He's behaving like he's the first person
to ever have a nervous breakdown.

1150
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:24,500
-Remember...
-We're all having nervous breakdowns, Ron.

1151
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:25,625
-We've got grapes.
-Want some?

1152
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:26,875
Banana?

1153
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:29,708
Every single fucking second.

1154
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,583
That was actually quite rude.

1155
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:34,791
Why, Ron?

1156
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:37,625
Why should we be
chasing around an infant

1157
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:41,500
when we have actual living kids at home
who are aging by the minute?

1158
01:00:41,583 --> 01:00:46,458
Because we are supporting a great artist
who shares with other human beings

1159
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:48,208
what it is to be a human being.

1160
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:49,916
We're human too, Ron.

1161
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:53,125
-More so, maybe.
-It's not about us.

1162
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:58,625
Our love isn't conditional. It's...
We're like parents or imaginary friends.

1163
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:01,250
We vanish under cloak of night,
with no trace.

1164
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:04,083
Maybe an elegant
business card that floats...

1165
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:06,708
What the fuck are you talking about?

1166
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:11,041
He's not our family or our friend.

1167
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,708
He was just at Vivienne's sweet 16.

1168
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:15,333
Were you at Daisy's graduation?

1169
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:17,541
I think... I think it was small.

1170
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:21,375
You weren't invited,
because it only goes one way.

1171
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:23,791
No one wants to say it, but it does.

1172
01:01:25,583 --> 01:01:27,833
We're not to him what he is to us.

1173
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:31,625
I disagree.

1174
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:07,250
What's wrong?

1175
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:13,166
Okay. My father is Jay Kelly.

1176
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:15,041
Like the actor?

1177
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:18,083
Yes, like the actor,
and also is the actor.

1178
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:22,345
The reason I'm telling you is because
he's standing right in front of us.

1179
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:24,916
Hey!

1180
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,125
Hey.

1181
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:31,041
I guess we're on the same train.

1182
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:32,833
Yeah, it's crazy, isn't it?

1183
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,333
-It's weird, Dad.
-Well, I had to be in Paris

1184
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:39,625
for a Dior campaign
and other bits and bobs,

1185
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:41,958
and then I made this train...

1186
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:46,083
for my tribute in Tuscany.
Hey, Rio.

1187
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:48,750
So...

1188
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:52,041
How was the jazz festival?

1189
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:56,416
Well... we didn't go.
Guillaume says it's all fusion now.

1190
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,875
<i>Bonjour.</i> Guillaume.

1191
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:00,250
-Guigui.
-Guigui. I'm Jay. Hi.

1192
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:06,416
Guillaume was our waiter at Café de Flore.
He's a singer and a filmmaker.

1193
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,083
No, I'm not. That's...

1194
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:11,458
It's embarrassing to say filmmaker to you.

1195
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:13,004
-No, it isn't.
-No, it's not.

1196
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:20,333
Daisy, how does it feel to have the hero
of so many brilliant films of our time

1197
01:03:20,416 --> 01:03:22,750
to be your father?

1198
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:24,333
Yes, Daisy, how does that feel?

1199
01:03:24,416 --> 01:03:26,916
I think I know him too well to tell.

1200
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:30,500
Jay Kelly is a hero of cinema.

1201
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:32,250
I like this guy.

1202
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,291
Wow.

1203
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:44,018
What was I gonna tell you?

1204
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:48,583
Anyway, listen, I don't want to intrude.

1205
01:03:48,666 --> 01:03:51,458
I just wanted to invite you all

1206
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:53,750
to my tribute on Saturday.

1207
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:57,041
I can totally get tickets
for all five of you.

1208
01:03:57,541 --> 01:04:00,125
Since when did you care
so much about a tribute?

1209
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:01,666
I don't know. I think I care.

1210
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,208
I'm inviting Dad.

1211
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:05,458
-I think I'd make it a family thing.
-You invited Grandpa?

1212
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:07,542
-Do you really want him there?
-I'd like him to come.

1213
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:09,333
And I'm inviting Jessica too.

1214
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:10,250
-Jessie?
-Yeah.

1215
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:14,000
It's a little more complicated with her,
'cause you and I are in the same country.

1216
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:15,541
On the same train.

1217
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:20,375
Let me get back to you about it, okay?
We're on kind of a tight schedule.

1218
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:23,000
We're going to this ancient horse race.

1219
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:24,083
It's gonna be fun.

1220
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:27,875
Uh...

1221
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:30,666
So, um...

1222
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:32,416
Paris was great?

1223
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:35,578
-It was amazing.
-All right, so tell me everything.

1224
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:39,958
We jumped off rocks
into pools in the woods.

1225
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:42,667
We went to this crazy bar
that David Lynch designed,

1226
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:43,708
and I ate a brain.

1227
01:04:44,291 --> 01:04:46,958
We went to Delacroix's house.

1228
01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:50,238
Do you know his paintings?
They're really, really amazing.

1229
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,415
Dad, are you listening to me?

1230
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:56,916
I'm listening to you.
This is the look of me listening.

1231
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,625
-You asked me about Paris.
-Start again, just two sentences back.

1232
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:02,875
You're so ADD.
I'm gonna go get some snacks.

1233
01:05:02,958 --> 01:05:04,916
No, don't get snacks. No, stay, come on.

1234
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,750
I'm sorry. It's strange.

1235
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:09,875
It's great, but it's...

1236
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:13,208
It's strange hearing
about your experiences

1237
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:15,791
and seeing you so independent.

1238
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:17,833
I'm sorry. Okay, so tell me...

1239
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:20,875
-Uh, you ate a brain.
-I ate a brain.

1240
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:24,833
And we danced with these tango kids
outside of the opera house.

1241
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:27,875
And I think I want to act.

1242
01:05:29,541 --> 01:05:30,375
Wow.

1243
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:33,833
All right.

1244
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:37,791
After college, if it's still something
that you feel you want to do, then...

1245
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:40,375
I think I might not want
to go to college right now.

1246
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:43,500
Guigui's making a film in Sicily,
and he's asked me to be in it.

1247
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:46,750
It's just a little thing
about memories and dreams.

1248
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:48,250
You're going to college.

1249
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:51,167
You worked incredibly hard,
and this is an amazing opportunity.

1250
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:53,458
-One that I never had.
-I never even allowed myself

1251
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:56,250
to think of being an actor because of you,
but I am good.

1252
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:58,417
I know you always thought
Jessie was the talented one.

1253
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,833
You're one of the most
brilliant people I've ever met.

1254
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:03,583
-I just don't think you want that life.
-That is so hypocritical.

1255
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:05,792
-Acting has been your whole life.
-I know how difficult it is,

1256
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:08,167
and how much you miss,
and how crazy it makes you,

1257
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,833
and how lonely it makes you.

1258
01:06:09,916 --> 01:06:10,916
You're never alone.

1259
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,917
-Thanks, Silvano.
-You're welcome.

1260
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,666
Just think about the tribute.

1261
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:19,166
'Cause I can make it work
from the horse race or wherever you are.

1262
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,250
I can send a car or a helicopter.

1263
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:24,065
There's a jet picking up your grandpa.
Whatever you need.

1264
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:26,625
How did you end up on this train, Dad?

1265
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:29,708
Well...

1266
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:36,708
I knew. I...

1267
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:42,166
I...

1268
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:46,333
I knew, because, uh,

1269
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:48,958
Rio is using her mom's credit card.

1270
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:51,375
Oh, my God. That is so fucked up.

1271
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:53,458
Rio, your mother's tracking you
on your Amex.

1272
01:06:53,541 --> 01:06:54,541
Fuck.

1273
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,083
-I wanted to surprise you.
-You stalked me to Europe.

1274
01:06:58,166 --> 01:07:01,041
I'm here because you can't just leave

1275
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:03,541
and stop being a kid.

1276
01:07:03,625 --> 01:07:07,000
-I haven't spent enough time with you.
-It's you and all your people.

1277
01:07:07,083 --> 01:07:09,792
-Come on. I'm not that guy.
-No, you're totally that guy.

1278
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:11,958
You can't say "helicopter"
and not be that guy.

1279
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:13,750
I'm just trying to make it easy for you...

1280
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:17,625
I don't want a helicopter or a jet.
I just want to be on a rickety train

1281
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:19,500
and in a youth hostel and in a tent.

1282
01:07:19,583 --> 01:07:22,333
I want to have this holiday
without you, Dad.

1283
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:26,458
I fucking hate you, Mom.
You're worse than Russia.

1284
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:28,492
-Forgive me.
-I will never forgive you.

1285
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:29,750
No!

1286
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:31,979
-Do not cancel the card.
-Nice to meet you.

1287
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:47,875
Don't go.

1288
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,583
He needs you.

1289
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:52,000
-I need you.
-Tell Jay I'm sorry.

1290
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:55,166
My dog ate a screw.
I wrote him an apology.

1291
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:57,208
It's like we always say.

1292
01:07:57,916 --> 01:08:00,291
If it feels good, don't do it.

1293
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:03,375
And here are the outfits for each event.
They're color coded.

1294
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:05,083
I'm doing it.

1295
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:08,416
You did just bolt that night.

1296
01:08:10,416 --> 01:08:11,916
Back then on the Eiffel Tower.

1297
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:16,708
We just sat down to dinner.
I wanted to turn our phones off.

1298
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:19,333
But you said, "Keep them on just in case."

1299
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,291
And of course we got the call.

1300
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:26,491
Jay had been photographed with
that daughter of the French ambassador.

1301
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:28,500
One of us had to go.

1302
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:31,125
I stayed to keep the table.

1303
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,375
I was so nervous...

1304
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:39,208
because I had
a ring planted in the ganache.

1305
01:08:42,041 --> 01:08:43,500
I never knew that part.

1306
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:46,416
Yeah, it was like a very romantic movie.

1307
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:50,625
But one that is not romantic at all,
in fact, because...

1308
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:53,750
you never came back.

1309
01:08:58,208 --> 01:09:00,875
Well, I was with Jay.

1310
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:02,916
And you were calling.

1311
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:08,791
Jay is always gonna come first.

1312
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:12,750
We were never going to have
a moment that was just ours.

1313
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:19,583
I'm sorry about the Eiffel Tower.

1314
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:25,291
It's okay. I'm happy.

1315
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:27,500
I know.

1316
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,791
And, uh, me too.

1317
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:36,000
And also, I'm sorry.

1318
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:38,291
Thank you.

1319
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:51,958
Save yourself.

1320
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:29,083
What did they say?

1321
01:10:29,666 --> 01:10:31,583
The bloody air conditioning is no more.

1322
01:10:31,666 --> 01:10:33,333
Oh, swell.

1323
01:10:36,791 --> 01:10:38,916
-Hi.
<i>-Vivienne's feet are swollen</i>

1324
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,916
<i>-like I have never seen swollen.</i>
-Wait, wait. Swollen how?

1325
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,541
Like after the cello recital?

1326
01:10:43,625 --> 01:10:46,416
-So much worse, Ron.
-I can't get into my Jordans, Dad.

1327
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:47,625
I had to wear Crocs.

1328
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:51,458
-Her feet look like big blimps.
-We're on our way to Dr. Fenner's.

1329
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:53,667
I'm doing everything I can
to keep it together.

1330
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,500
It's disgusting, Dad.
Michael Bronfman said it looks deformed.

1331
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:58,541
Michael Bronfman is an asshole.

1332
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:00,666
Dad.

1333
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:04,042
-When did the swelling start this time?
-Right after the tennis debacle.

1334
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:05,208
<i>-Oh, God.</i>
-Almost immediately.

1335
01:11:05,291 --> 01:11:07,041
I get it. So it's my fault?

1336
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:10,625
-I didn't say it was your fault, Ron.
-Did the cream not work?

1337
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:13,500
-<i>The cream did nothing.</i>
-Because you really gotta slather it.

1338
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:16,583
Ron, we slathered it,
and we did the Advil.

1339
01:11:16,666 --> 01:11:18,541
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

1340
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:20,375
Mom, you just totally ran a red light.

1341
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:21,791
Oh, fuck. Sorry.

1342
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:23,291
You're gonna get a ticket.

1343
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:26,125
Vivi, you're going to be okay,
you hear me?

1344
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:27,666
-<i>You think?</i>
-I know.

1345
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,666
Dad, am I gonna be okay?

1346
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:32,000
You are. You're gonna be great.

1347
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:35,083
-You too, Lois. You're my hero.
-<i>We're turning in now, Ron.</i>

1348
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:38,375
-We'll call you from the doctor's.
-Dad, I think I might love Mom more.

1349
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:41,208
I love you all so much.

1350
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:44,916
-Can you hear me, Lois?
<i>-Yes, I can hear you, you're on speaker.</i>

1351
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,875
It kills me that I'm not there with you.

1352
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:50,000
-<i>You're breaking up, Ron. Hell...</i>
-You're all my babies.

1353
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:52,229
-I love... Baby?
<i>-Mom, I told you to valet.</i>

1354
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:17,125
<i>-Dear Jay.
-Dear Jay.</i>

1355
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:20,208
<i>-You say...
-You say you always want to be with me.</i>

1356
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:25,333
<i>But your actions aren't speaking
the way your words are.</i>

1357
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:35,541
<i>My worst day was
when my babysitter rented</i>

1358
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:38,250
<i>that movie you did with Daphne Spender.</i>

1359
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:49,208
And cut.

1360
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:55,750
Check...

1361
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,220
Yeah, check the switches.

1362
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:01,833
Sorry, I feel we should've
got to know each other a bit

1363
01:13:01,916 --> 01:13:03,166
before we did this.

1364
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:06,518
Sometimes it's better to have sex
with someone before you know them.

1365
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,875
Or pretend sex. In this case.

1366
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:12,178
Have you had pretend sex
with a lot of people before you knew them?

1367
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:16,416
A few. It's the least sexy thing ever.

1368
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,500
It's so embarrassing.

1369
01:13:19,041 --> 01:13:21,250
-That hush that descends.
-Oh, yeah.

1370
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:23,958
It's like we doing something
incredibly serious and important.

1371
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:26,333
Well, it's more like a funeral
than a love scene.

1372
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:27,875
I know.

1373
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:28,833
Okay.

1374
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:31,742
-We're rolling.
-Forty six, take eight.

1375
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:36,000
And I'll just talk you through it.

1376
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:40,541
So, Jay, can you kiss her?

1377
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:47,666
And kiss the neck.

1378
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,625
Then the shoulder.

1379
01:13:53,458 --> 01:13:55,875
Daphne, run your hands through his hair.

1380
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:05,500
I'm sorry.

1381
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:10,708
-Did you just fart?
-Yes!

1382
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:15,750
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay. It's fine.

1383
01:14:16,291 --> 01:14:19,625
So... sorry.

1384
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:21,791
Okay, still rolling.

1385
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,708
Okay.

1386
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:27,541
Neck...

1387
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:33,208
Hair...

1388
01:14:35,416 --> 01:14:36,416
Shoulder...

1389
01:14:39,416 --> 01:14:40,708
Okay. Cue Eli.

1390
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:44,750
-Are you asking to be tickled?
-No.

1391
01:14:45,333 --> 01:14:48,375
-He is. Get him!
-Asking to be tickly!

1392
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:51,333
-And cut. Good.
-Okay, Eli.

1393
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:53,666
-Time to go back to school.
-Can we go again?

1394
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:55,041
Really?

1395
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:58,174
-Maybe I had an idea.
-I thought we were great.

1396
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:00,250
You did?

1397
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,542
Jay wants to go again.

1398
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:07,791
-Can we beg the tutor?
-Yeah.

1399
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:13,083
Ooh.

1400
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:14,583
-Yeah?
-Very good.

1401
01:15:14,666 --> 01:15:16,959
I'm not gonna let you win.
I'm very competitive.

1402
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:20,875
I wonder if you remember this
the way I do.

1403
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:24,916
I'm cutting high here. There you go.

1404
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,458
I was still married, just had Jessica.

1405
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:31,666
We stayed on the set that day,
played cards with the kid.

1406
01:15:32,291 --> 01:15:34,916
-Daphne, you're cheating.
-I'm not.

1407
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,708
If you hold your cards splayed out
like that, how can I not look?

1408
01:15:37,791 --> 01:15:39,500
He was our decoy.

1409
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:42,041
It was okay to be together
as long as he was there.

1410
01:15:42,583 --> 01:15:43,916
Hanging out like a...

1411
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,458
pretend family.

1412
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:02,833
We didn't even kiss for real
until the very end of the shoot.

1413
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:06,916
Later, you told me that...
that you wouldn't fall in love with me.

1414
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,585
Maybe you were telling the truth,
maybe you never did.

1415
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:12,625
A month later...

1416
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:18,916
Jessica's mom moved her to Seattle.
I saw less and less of her.

1417
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,750
You quit movies and said that

1418
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:23,272
you loved acting,
but you didn't want to be famous.

1419
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,541
Man, life is so weird.

1420
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,500
I wonder if you think about it like I do.

1421
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,041
Anyway...

1422
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:44,958
There were a million reasons
why we didn't stay together and...

1423
01:16:47,166 --> 01:16:48,666
We're going again.

1424
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:51,583
And... action.

1425
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,666
I'm so in love with you.

1426
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,791
Italy. What is its fatal charm?

1427
01:17:27,916 --> 01:17:30,833
I believe it is a certain permission
to be human.

1428
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:33,541
Which other places lost too long ago.

1429
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:35,333
I had a dream about you.

1430
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:38,458
I loved you in the dream
just as much as I do in real life...

1431
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:39,541
Really? All right?

1432
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:41,667
I had a dream I had
a window in my chest, right?

1433
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,458
But the view was the view
from our bathroom...

1434
01:17:56,666 --> 01:17:59,583
I'm suddenly remembering things
I haven't thought about in a long time.

1435
01:17:59,666 --> 01:18:04,041
-My family's losing it at home.
-Like a movie where I'm playing myself.

1436
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:06,583
-Watching myself...
-I'm sorry, go again.

1437
01:18:06,666 --> 01:18:10,000
-I didn't hear a word you said.
-I said I'm suddenly remembering things.

1438
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:11,041
Now, what is that?

1439
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:12,791
-Memory?
-Well, yes.

1440
01:18:13,916 --> 01:18:18,333
Maybe your memory's trying
to tell you something about your present.

1441
01:18:18,416 --> 01:18:21,250
-Like what?
-I don't know. I'm tired.

1442
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:24,208
-I just had a fight with Daisy.
-I wish I was there to help them.

1443
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:26,208
-What?
-What? Nothing.

1444
01:18:26,291 --> 01:18:28,041
-Ah.
-I'm just... tired...

1445
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:31,708
I just wish I would have spent more time
with her, I was always at work.

1446
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:35,166
Well, I always negotiated flights
on the weekends for you

1447
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:38,042
-to go home and see the kids.
-It was very difficult to...

1448
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:40,542
-What are you getting at?
-I'm just saying, Ben, for instance,

1449
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:43,458
flies home every weekend
from the show to see his family.

1450
01:18:43,541 --> 01:18:45,375
-Ben? Ben Alcock?
-I'm not comparing.

1451
01:18:45,458 --> 01:18:48,292
-It's hard not to feel like you are.
-These are the decisions we make

1452
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:50,875
-like I made to come on this trip.
-These aren't just decisions.

1453
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:52,792
Or not kiss Liz back.
My family would rather...

1454
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:53,916
Kiss Liz back?

1455
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,208
-...I'm home right now.
-Did you kiss Liz?

1456
01:18:56,791 --> 01:18:59,083
-No, she kissed me.
-Where is Liz?

1457
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:02,750
Liz left. Krista, too.
Her dog ate a screw.

1458
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:04,291
Krista's dog, not Liz's.

1459
01:19:04,958 --> 01:19:06,291
Liz was just pissed.

1460
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,458
She left you this note.

1461
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:10,125
Krista, not Liz.

1462
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,875
Liz <i>leave</i> leave, like forever?

1463
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:20,125
What is forever? I don't...

1464
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:23,000
Does Ben Alcock really fly home
on the weekends?

1465
01:19:23,083 --> 01:19:24,958
Ben's no saint.
This was his second marriage.

1466
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:27,833
-She was the nanny.
-You don't have to put him down.

1467
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:31,250
Were you ever gonna let me know
what happened with Timothy?

1468
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:33,541
-I told you I would.
-Yeah, but you didn't.

1469
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,125
Think maybe you can get me a water?

1470
01:19:38,916 --> 01:19:40,000
Can't you get it?

1471
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:47,833
Stop! Thief!

1472
01:19:48,541 --> 01:19:50,125
He's got my handbag.

1473
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:54,291
No. No... no.

1474
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:02,416
Whoa!

1475
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:20,250
Oh! Fuck!

1476
01:20:20,333 --> 01:20:23,833
Whoa! Whoa! Silvano! I'm-I'm going.

1477
01:20:23,916 --> 01:20:24,916
Oh. Oh.

1478
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:28,958
He really is a hero.

1479
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:40,863
-I wanna go out there.
-God, I love your attitude.

1480
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:42,916
I've got five.

1481
01:20:43,416 --> 01:20:45,250
-Go!
-That is so not fair.

1482
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:48,333
This is unbelievable.

1483
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:22,541
-Oh!
-Oof.

1484
01:21:29,958 --> 01:21:33,291
-I got you, you son of a bitch!
-You should've gone ahead, Clive.

1485
01:21:35,708 --> 01:21:36,792
Jay captured the thief!

1486
01:21:36,875 --> 01:21:39,208
-Hey, bravo!
-Shit was real.

1487
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:42,125
-There we go.
-Thanks, love!

1488
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:45,086
-And he gave him a black eye, the bastard.
-A real shiner.

1489
01:21:45,583 --> 01:21:46,416
Oh.

1490
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,041
Bravo, bravo!

1491
01:21:48,583 --> 01:21:50,250
-Okay, all right.
-Mwah!

1492
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,375
-Bravo.
-Such a gentleman.

1493
01:21:53,458 --> 01:21:56,166
Stop looking at me
and talking about me all the time.

1494
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:01,208
Please be kind,
he just needs his medication.

1495
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:03,250
He's a nice guy, a real family man.

1496
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:05,772
He has three wonderful kids.
This is not who he is.

1497
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:13,583
You're a hero, puppy.

1498
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,375
Okay?

1499
01:22:23,375 --> 01:22:24,875
-Come on.
-Will you just...

1500
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:26,208
get him to a doctor.

1501
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:28,208
I'll get you that water.

1502
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:30,143
I'll be there in a minute.

1503
01:22:50,375 --> 01:22:54,083
"And the little tiny, tiny fur animal

1504
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:58,125
"ran down a hole into
the ground." You see?

1505
01:22:58,208 --> 01:23:01,666
<i>A little cute bear putting on its coat.</i>

1506
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:02,666
Mm-hmm.

1507
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:06,208
"Then sun went down beyond the river..."

1508
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,784
I'll take care of your bike, okay?

1509
01:23:22,041 --> 01:23:23,833
Daisy, can you please tell them?

1510
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,083
Daisy.

1511
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:28,666
Daisy?

1512
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,625
Can you tell her that it's true?

1513
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:32,000
What is true?

1514
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:34,083
Like the horse can win without...

1515
01:23:34,166 --> 01:23:35,166
Have fun.

1516
01:23:36,375 --> 01:23:37,916
See you, Dad. Love you.

1517
01:23:39,208 --> 01:23:41,833
Love you, too.

1518
01:23:48,041 --> 01:23:49,583
It's right to let her go.

1519
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,625
So, I spoke to Alan,
he's got a legal letter ready.

1520
01:23:55,708 --> 01:23:58,500
I signed off on it. We also have to have
a statement prepared

1521
01:23:58,583 --> 01:24:01,750
in case T-Timothy goes to the press.

1522
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:06,666
I got a draft here, I need you to read it,
be okay with it.

1523
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,291
These are yours.

1524
01:24:09,125 --> 01:24:12,375
I know you know what to say.
Whatever happens, happens.

1525
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:17,000
Daisy's my friend, too,
and I betrayed her.

1526
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:19,125
You were just doing your job.

1527
01:24:19,208 --> 01:24:22,458
That's a Nazi excuse.
I feel like such a bad person.

1528
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:24,541
It's my fault, Meg. Listen...

1529
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:28,416
take a break, go on a holiday in Italy.

1530
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,500
I'll be fine. Is it...? Uh...

1531
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:32,875
Ron, do you have any...? Um...

1532
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:39,250
Thank you, Jay.

1533
01:24:40,291 --> 01:24:43,583
For the record, I'd love it
if my father chased me across Europe.

1534
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:49,000
Oh, and Emmanuel Macron
is taking Candy to Geneva,

1535
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:50,644
so you need another hair person.

1536
01:24:51,291 --> 01:24:53,625
I love you and congratulations.

1537
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:55,625
Mr. Kelly! Sorry.

1538
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:57,666
Mr. Caterpillar. Hi.

1539
01:24:58,833 --> 01:25:00,666
Hi, I'm Alba, your driver.

1540
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:02,542
Your daddy is waiting for you

1541
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:05,375
at the restaurant with Antonio
and host committee.

1542
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:06,500
-My "daddy"?
-Yeah.

1543
01:25:06,583 --> 01:25:09,791
Your daddy. I called him
and sent a plane. He's very excited.

1544
01:25:09,875 --> 01:25:12,208
Shit. I didn't think he'd actually come.

1545
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,583
I will bring you to your daddy.

1546
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:21,708
{\an8}Is this everyone?

1547
01:25:22,916 --> 01:25:24,666
-Mmm.
-Yeah? Okay.

1548
01:25:26,208 --> 01:25:27,500
Can you take maybe one bag?

1549
01:25:27,583 --> 01:25:28,916
-You take it.
-What?

1550
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,041
Take it.

1551
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,583
Jesus Christ.

1552
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,458
Ah, I forgot to give you, Mr. Kelly.

1553
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:42,625
Mr. Caterpillar, your cheesecake.

1554
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:45,708
-Wonderful. Thank you.
-My rider. You eat it.

1555
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:49,291
Here in Italy, we like to work hard.

1556
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:54,625
But also, when we finish our work,
we relax and we like to eat.

1557
01:25:54,708 --> 01:26:00,125
We cry sometimes, but also,
if you are funny, we might laugh.

1558
01:26:01,166 --> 01:26:02,458
Sometimes we get married...

1559
01:26:02,541 --> 01:26:05,541
Don't get mad at Candy.
We'll find you a new hair person.

1560
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:07,542
I have too many people around me anyway.

1561
01:26:07,625 --> 01:26:09,208
You need some people, right?

1562
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:11,375
We argue sometimes. But also...

1563
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:14,791
-Maybe an accountant.
-A lawyer. You need Alan.

1564
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:17,333
Who else? Publicity, chef.

1565
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:19,666
Or me. You need me.

1566
01:26:20,916 --> 01:26:22,416
Yeah, Ron. I need you.

1567
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:27,458
Fuck. I think I just hit a rabbit.

1568
01:26:27,541 --> 01:26:30,791
Alba, is there someplace we can get a gift
or something for my dad?

1569
01:26:30,875 --> 01:26:31,833
Yeah, yeah.

1570
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:34,666
Can you drop me
at Ristorante da Rosa, please?

1571
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:35,666
Where you goin'?

1572
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:38,458
Uh, I have a 5 p.m.
Just a quick drink in town.

1573
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:40,916
I'll be back for your dinner.
Save me a tiramisu.

1574
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,666
Who do you have a 5 p.m. with?

1575
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:46,458
Uh, Ben Alcock. I just...
I gotta put a little time in with him.

1576
01:26:46,541 --> 01:26:48,375
'Cause he's also getting a tribute?

1577
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:49,958
The second tribute, yes.

1578
01:26:50,041 --> 01:26:53,625
So you're gonna just leave me alone
with my "daddy."

1579
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:56,375
I'm here for you. I'm always here.

1580
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:59,250
And I'll be with you from 7
for the rest of the trip.

1581
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:03,000
I don't care. Meet Ben Alcock.
What's in his rider?

1582
01:27:03,083 --> 01:27:05,333
Actually, Ben's rider is quite minimal.

1583
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:06,916
Fuck off.

1584
01:27:22,083 --> 01:27:25,458
<i>-Ciao, Signore Ron.</i>
-Thank you, Alba.

1585
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:29,666
Try to have some fun.
Say hi to your dad for me.

1586
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:37,250
You might meet a ghost
while you sleep here.

1587
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:42,833
The ghosts are usually little monks
who expose themselves.

1588
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:45,333
I would have thought
they would love to meet Jay Kelly.

1589
01:27:45,416 --> 01:27:48,833
So, I stopped pumping iron,
and I took up yoga.

1590
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:52,458
And now I'm in the best shape of my life!

1591
01:27:52,541 --> 01:27:54,375
Still slender, but taut.

1592
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:57,916
Also keep the mental game tough.
Do a little sudoku.

1593
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,291
-Ah.
-Hey.

1594
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:04,166
-My son, the movie star.
-Hey, Studly.

1595
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:06,125
Oh.

1596
01:28:06,708 --> 01:28:07,875
-Studly made it.
-Ah.

1597
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:10,416
Uh, meet Captain Jenny and Lourdes.

1598
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,750
They flew me in on that tiny plane
you got me.

1599
01:28:12,833 --> 01:28:13,708
Lady pilot.

1600
01:28:13,791 --> 01:28:16,208
Your father entertained us all the way
from Maine to Florence

1601
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:19,458
with his wonderful,
often offensive stories.

1602
01:28:19,541 --> 01:28:21,375
What a personality.

1603
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:26,875
Jay, the apple doesn't fall
very far from the tree.

1604
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:27,791
Well...

1605
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:31,958
Now, where is this famous Ron?
We expected the whole team.

1606
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:36,583
Yes. We thought Mr. Caterpillar
would have rolled very deep.

1607
01:28:36,666 --> 01:28:38,500
No, the famous Ron had a 5 p.m.

1608
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,041
Ron is very protective of you.

1609
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:44,708
He was so worried about
the size and the shape of your trophy.

1610
01:28:45,583 --> 01:28:47,000
I'm sure I'll love it.

1611
01:28:47,083 --> 01:28:48,750
A local artisan, Giovanni,

1612
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:54,791
did what I think you Americans call
an all-nighter, and blew it himself.

1613
01:29:04,166 --> 01:29:09,208
Giovanni regrets the mask.
He suffers from infinite COVID.

1614
01:29:09,291 --> 01:29:12,708
Jay Kelly. Your cheesecake is waiting.

1615
01:29:14,125 --> 01:29:15,750
Jesus Christ.

1616
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:17,833
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1617
01:29:18,958 --> 01:29:22,500
I'm the best friend anybody has,
but you don't want me as an enemy.

1618
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:25,125
I promise you that.
Because what you're saying...

1619
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:27,541
Would... I... Let me talk!

1620
01:29:27,625 --> 01:29:31,875
Because what you're saying sounds
remarkably like a shakedown.

1621
01:29:31,958 --> 01:29:33,083
I'm happy to be wrong,

1622
01:29:33,166 --> 01:29:36,581
but if that's what we're doing,
I'm hanging up the telephone right now.

1623
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,541
You do that.
Speak to Timothy, then call me back.

1624
01:29:44,916 --> 01:29:49,250
Alan, are you there? That motherfucker
was trying to shake us down.

1625
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:52,583
It's dead.
Did we hear from the detective?

1626
01:29:52,666 --> 01:29:53,690
Like the neckerchief.

1627
01:29:54,083 --> 01:29:57,500
All right. Hold your fire.
I got a drink now with Benny boy.

1628
01:29:58,375 --> 01:30:01,541
Yeah. Yeah. Let me know.
I'll call you after.

1629
01:30:01,625 --> 01:30:02,625
Yeah. <i>Ciao.</i>

1630
01:30:02,708 --> 01:30:04,875
It's hot as hell. Jesus.

1631
01:30:04,958 --> 01:30:09,083
-What happened? What'd you say?
-Uh, I-I like the neckerchief.

1632
01:30:09,166 --> 01:30:12,208
Yeah? Yeah. Right. Ahh.

1633
01:30:12,291 --> 01:30:16,750
You look handsome, Ben Alcock
with the dreamy blue eyes.

1634
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:22,125
-Flight good?
-It was a two-class plane, small first.

1635
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:23,750
But lie-down beds, so...

1636
01:30:23,833 --> 01:30:25,666
-Happy ending.
-Yeah.

1637
01:30:26,375 --> 01:30:28,917
-Did you order a drink?
-Uh, I'm just having seltzer.

1638
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,583
-Aww. Well...
-You just fly in?

1639
01:30:31,666 --> 01:30:36,583
Train. It was a whole...
But, um, it's fine. We're all good.

1640
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:39,875
I just sent Jay to a dinner
with the festival people.

1641
01:30:40,375 --> 01:30:42,750
-Jay got a dinner?
-You got a dinner too.

1642
01:30:43,541 --> 01:30:46,750
-My schedule said "drinks."
-You don't wanna be at that dinner.

1643
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:48,917
You brought your family.
You're a proper human.

1644
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,250
Jay is single and weird
and needs to be entertained.

1645
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:54,000
You don't have to put Jay down
to make me feel better.

1646
01:30:54,083 --> 01:30:57,167
-You do that, Ron. You know that?
-I love Jay. Been like a father to Jay.

1647
01:30:57,250 --> 01:31:00,125
But much less complicated
because I'm like a brother.

1648
01:31:00,208 --> 01:31:01,333
I could use a drink!

1649
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:08,166
So, I-I've been thinking,
and, uh, talking to Melanie.

1650
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:12,541
And... And I feel like I'm not
really getting enough of you.

1651
01:31:13,875 --> 01:31:17,500
Really? I'm here now, puppy.
What haven't I been there for?

1652
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:20,417
I know you're in the Jay Kelly business,
and I can't compete with him.

1653
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,541
I'm okay with that.

1654
01:31:22,625 --> 01:31:24,667
I mean, I know the only reason
I'm getting this tribute

1655
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:27,125
-is because he passed on it.
-And then took it back.

1656
01:31:27,208 --> 01:31:28,916
I'm sorry that got all <i>farkakte.</i>

1657
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,375
But don't worry.
You're both getting trophies.

1658
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:32,921
But I need to get some of you.

1659
01:31:34,583 --> 01:31:38,875
Okay. Jay is one of my clients,
but he's not my only client.

1660
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:40,291
How can I improve?

1661
01:31:42,041 --> 01:31:44,291
I'm gonna go without a manager
for a while.

1662
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:47,875
-Hold on.
-Just an attorney and an agent.

1663
01:31:47,958 --> 01:31:49,167
-And a publicist.
-All right.

1664
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,542
Uh, and a business manager.

1665
01:31:50,625 --> 01:31:52,750
You're my second oldest client ever.

1666
01:31:52,833 --> 01:31:55,083
We've been together
since the Disney shows.

1667
01:31:55,166 --> 01:31:57,875
-I... I know.
-I'm having problems at home.

1668
01:31:57,958 --> 01:32:01,042
-Vivienne has anxiety and swollen feet.
-I'm sorry to hear that.

1669
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:03,542
You're just coming off
a successful television show.

1670
01:32:03,625 --> 01:32:07,125
-That correction takes a minute.
-It's been a minute already.

1671
01:32:07,208 --> 01:32:10,542
You're in-between ages, but I really feel
like you're entering a sweet spot.

1672
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:12,000
I-I just need to try this.

1673
01:32:12,083 --> 01:32:14,666
I was at your wedding. I gave you a toast!

1674
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:16,916
-I know! I know!
-We're family. I love you!

1675
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,708
Stop. Stop! Stop.

1676
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:23,333
I knew it would be hard to do this.

1677
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:28,625
I was gonna send an email
after the tribute,

1678
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:31,125
but Melanie said I should do it in person.

1679
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:32,250
I didn't have to.

1680
01:32:32,958 --> 01:32:37,375
There are things I do all day long
that you don't know about.

1681
01:32:37,458 --> 01:32:39,458
No, don't...
don't try to talk me out of it.

1682
01:32:39,541 --> 01:32:41,625
No, don't cry.

1683
01:32:42,625 --> 01:32:44,167
-You're crying, puppy.
-No, I know.

1684
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:46,708
But it doesn't mean you have to cry.

1685
01:32:46,791 --> 01:32:49,500
Okay, you cry, puppy.
You were crying first.

1686
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:59,000
I'm sorry. I'm just...

1687
01:32:59,083 --> 01:33:03,083
I'm just jet-lagged and I'm tired
and I'm old.

1688
01:33:19,708 --> 01:33:21,875
<i>She's okay.</i>

1689
01:33:21,958 --> 01:33:26,000
<i>Fenner says that she's picking up on
your stress, and it's affecting her feet.</i>

1690
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:28,708
How the fuck is my stress
affecting Vivienne's feet?

1691
01:33:28,791 --> 01:33:31,083
<i>Relax, Ronnie.
It makes sense if you think about it.</i>

1692
01:33:31,166 --> 01:33:34,625
You're gonna let a foot doctor
analyze our child? What is wrong with you?

1693
01:33:34,708 --> 01:33:38,208
Don't speak to me like that.
I am single-parenting it here.

1694
01:33:38,291 --> 01:33:41,625
-And we all have David's cold.
-I'm sorry. I love you.

1695
01:33:41,708 --> 01:33:44,625
It's just... I'm havin' a bad day.

1696
01:33:45,208 --> 01:33:47,166
-Are you okay?
<i>-No.</i>

1697
01:33:48,708 --> 01:33:52,541
I was just fired, and I'm cryin'.
I'm alone in Italy, and I'm cryin'.

1698
01:33:55,416 --> 01:33:59,291
I know you're mad at me.
Can I just hear "I love you" back?

1699
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:04,166
-Jay fired you?
-No. Ben.

1700
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:06,875
-Jay fired Dad?
-No, Ben. Go back inside.

1701
01:34:08,333 --> 01:34:09,958
That motherfucker.

1702
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:12,250
And you got him this tribute
and everything.

1703
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:13,791
<i>I know.</i>

1704
01:34:13,875 --> 01:34:15,416
You still have Jay, right?

1705
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:17,541
Yes, yes, I still have Jay.

1706
01:34:17,625 --> 01:34:20,041
If I ever get him back to do this movie.

1707
01:34:20,125 --> 01:34:23,291
-Can you just say it, please?
<i>-What is that sound?</i>

1708
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:26,000
The bells. It's all death and...

1709
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:28,041
firing here!

1710
01:34:29,958 --> 01:34:33,291
Ron, I just saw the thing
on Page Six about Jay.

1711
01:34:33,375 --> 01:34:34,666
<i>Wait. What... What thing?</i>

1712
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:37,541
What thing about Jay?

1713
01:34:37,625 --> 01:34:38,791
Lois?

1714
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:41,541
So why am I here, Studly?
Who dropped out?

1715
01:34:42,083 --> 01:34:44,166
Nobody. I invited you.

1716
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:45,541
-Oh?
-Yes.

1717
01:34:45,625 --> 01:34:48,250
First time in years Studly's
brought me to a rat fuck.

1718
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:51,458
He got threatened when I showed up
at the Globes in the '90s.

1719
01:34:51,541 --> 01:34:52,583
That's not true.

1720
01:34:52,666 --> 01:34:54,715
Jay's dad was his most handsome back then.

1721
01:34:55,166 --> 01:34:57,117
Susan Sarandon had a little crush on me.

1722
01:34:58,166 --> 01:34:59,750
Well, I'm glad you're here.

1723
01:34:59,833 --> 01:35:03,333
She even sent me a video of a baby
elephant reuniting with his parents.

1724
01:35:03,416 --> 01:35:06,050
-And were they happy to see him?
-That was the point.

1725
01:35:06,541 --> 01:35:08,208
Very cute. Very tender.

1726
01:35:08,791 --> 01:35:10,041
What's this for?

1727
01:35:10,708 --> 01:35:11,958
For nothin'. It's a present.

1728
01:35:12,041 --> 01:35:13,875
-Well...
-It's a sweater!

1729
01:35:19,416 --> 01:35:20,875
Nice.

1730
01:35:20,958 --> 01:35:22,291
Nice.

1731
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:25,875
It is a sweater. Cashmere, no less.

1732
01:35:27,666 --> 01:35:28,625
You have it.

1733
01:35:29,125 --> 01:35:32,149
-Too high a thread count for your dad.
-No, I got it for you.

1734
01:35:34,833 --> 01:35:35,833
Take the sweater.

1735
01:35:40,333 --> 01:35:41,666
Where's my granddaughter?

1736
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,375
Ron said she'd be here.

1737
01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:45,583
She's doin' her own thing.
She's at that age.

1738
01:35:45,666 --> 01:35:46,833
You remember bein' 18.

1739
01:35:46,916 --> 01:35:50,208
I remember Brylcreem.
"A little dab'll do ya." Huh?

1740
01:35:50,291 --> 01:35:52,250
Mr. Kelly <i>padre?</i>

1741
01:35:52,333 --> 01:35:55,666
-Hmm?
-Are you also an artist, like your son?

1742
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:56,958
Artist? No.

1743
01:35:57,458 --> 01:35:58,958
Working stiff.

1744
01:35:59,041 --> 01:36:01,708
Worked for the John Deere corporation
for the past 35 years.

1745
01:36:01,791 --> 01:36:05,833
Retired, and all those assholes gave me
was a shitty pension and a fountain pen.

1746
01:36:05,916 --> 01:36:07,833
No trophy or cheesecake for your dad.

1747
01:36:07,916 --> 01:36:10,666
You toiled so your son
could have his dreams.

1748
01:36:11,375 --> 01:36:14,333
I like that. I like how you put that.

1749
01:36:15,208 --> 01:36:16,916
Yeah, when he was a boy,

1750
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,500
I thought he'd grow up to be somebody
that I'd like to have a beer with.

1751
01:36:20,583 --> 01:36:22,875
Not, uh, Beaujolais.

1752
01:36:22,958 --> 01:36:26,000
Yeah, I played tough guys
so I didn't have to be one.

1753
01:36:26,791 --> 01:36:29,791
Action movies are bullshit. It's all fake.

1754
01:36:29,875 --> 01:36:30,750
Ah.

1755
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:33,875
Did you always know
Jay was going to be a star?

1756
01:36:34,541 --> 01:36:37,375
Well, he barely said a word
till he was about five.

1757
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:40,583
Then one morning, he gets up,
and he comes down to breakfast,

1758
01:36:40,666 --> 01:36:43,166
and he starts talking
in this funny southern way.

1759
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:45,291
And he's acting very clumsy.

1760
01:36:46,416 --> 01:36:48,583
His mom thought he'd lost his mind,
but I said,

1761
01:36:48,666 --> 01:36:51,583
"Celia, no, no. Don't worry.
He's just playing a character."

1762
01:36:51,666 --> 01:36:54,125
I was impersonating my Uncle Mark.

1763
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:56,458
Right. He kept saying, "Seriously."

1764
01:36:56,541 --> 01:36:58,833
Which was Uncle Mark to a fuckin' tee.

1765
01:36:58,916 --> 01:37:01,125
"You're a good kid. Seriously."

1766
01:37:01,208 --> 01:37:04,037
-As if he didn't mean it otherwise.
-Oh, God. I broke up.

1767
01:37:04,541 --> 01:37:07,375
I've never seen you laugh so hard.
Mom either.

1768
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:11,666
She was always so sad when she drank.

1769
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:15,000
-Where is Uncle Mark?
-In jail for mail fraud.

1770
01:37:15,583 --> 01:37:16,851
-"Seriously?"
-Seriously.

1771
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:19,916
That's a...

1772
01:37:24,333 --> 01:37:29,041
We are sorry to gawp, but
you are all over the internet right now.

1773
01:37:29,666 --> 01:37:30,958
There is a video.

1774
01:37:32,041 --> 01:37:34,166
-On your phone?
-On all of our phones.

1775
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:37,750
-A dramatic altercation.
-With another man.

1776
01:37:46,666 --> 01:37:49,916
"Actor Jay Kelly becomes real life hero

1777
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,166
as he apprehends criminal

1778
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:55,666
in dramatic fashion,
worthy of the <i>cinema."</i>

1779
01:37:56,666 --> 01:38:02,291
Look at you, running
in your fancy moccasins. Run, Jay! Run!

1780
01:38:02,375 --> 01:38:06,291
"There was no 'action' or 'cut'
as Jay Kelly leaped from the train."

1781
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:09,417
I deplore violence. Haven't
we evolved beyond hitting and kicking?

1782
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,125
But he had to defend himself.

1783
01:38:11,208 --> 01:38:16,375
It says here the man was
a crazed thief, a lunatic in Spandex.

1784
01:38:16,458 --> 01:38:17,833
He wasn't a lunatic. He was...

1785
01:38:17,916 --> 01:38:20,458
-It was perhaps a sexual threat.
-No!

1786
01:38:20,541 --> 01:38:22,041
No. No. It wasn't.

1787
01:38:22,125 --> 01:38:24,710
You finally manage
to get your trousers dirty, Studly?

1788
01:38:26,958 --> 01:38:31,791
It is now time to take our real, live hero

1789
01:38:31,875 --> 01:38:35,041
to the real, live party.

1790
01:38:37,208 --> 01:38:39,833
You know what this countryside
reminds me of?

1791
01:38:40,333 --> 01:38:43,833
Bakersfield, California. Beautiful place.

1792
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:48,125
But everybody's out of work there. So sad.

1793
01:38:48,208 --> 01:38:50,403
I used to do a lot of business
in Bakersfield.

1794
01:39:01,166 --> 01:39:02,583
Fuck me.

1795
01:39:02,666 --> 01:39:04,875
There he is.

1796
01:39:04,958 --> 01:39:06,041
He's here.

1797
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:10,541
Jay Kelly, so handsome!

1798
01:39:10,625 --> 01:39:12,875
With the square-cut Superman jaw.

1799
01:39:12,958 --> 01:39:15,375
-Where were you?
-We said we'd meet at the party.

1800
01:39:15,458 --> 01:39:17,875
No, we said we'd meet at the dinner
and go to the party.

1801
01:39:17,958 --> 01:39:20,583
You said you'd go to the dinner,
and I'll go to the party.

1802
01:39:20,666 --> 01:39:22,416
You said, "Save me a tiramisu."

1803
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:25,083
-How was the tiramisu?
-It was cheesecake.

1804
01:39:26,708 --> 01:39:30,041
-Did you see the video?
-Oh. Our friends on the train filmed it.

1805
01:39:30,125 --> 01:39:32,875
-Great result. Congratulations.
-Calling me a hero. So embarrassing.

1806
01:39:32,958 --> 01:39:34,250
You are a hero, puppy.

1807
01:39:34,333 --> 01:39:37,291
If it was the other story,
I'd be the villain, not the hero.

1808
01:39:37,375 --> 01:39:40,000
Listen, listen. Come here.
I want you to hear this.

1809
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:41,750
-Where are you goin'?
-Come here.

1810
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:43,500
<i>Hello.</i>

1811
01:39:43,583 --> 01:39:47,791
Alan, you got Ron and Jay.
Sorry for the tribute noise.

1812
01:39:48,291 --> 01:39:50,875
-Tell Jay the news.
-<i>It's been taken care of, Jay.</i>

1813
01:39:50,958 --> 01:39:53,916
-What has?
<i>-Timothy, the lawsuit, the nose.</i>

1814
01:39:54,625 --> 01:39:55,625
<i>Everything.</i>

1815
01:39:55,708 --> 01:39:56,833
It's all done.

1816
01:39:56,916 --> 01:39:59,583
We discovered a pending drug charge
from the '90s

1817
01:39:59,666 --> 01:40:01,227
that would destroy his business.

1818
01:40:01,583 --> 01:40:04,625
-It's done?
<i>-It's gone away. You're free, Jay.</i>

1819
01:40:04,708 --> 01:40:06,708
You are too young to be his daddy.

1820
01:40:06,791 --> 01:40:08,791
Why, thank you.

1821
01:40:08,875 --> 01:40:11,666
And you're too young to be young.

1822
01:40:17,166 --> 01:40:19,708
-I want to apologize.
-To who, Timothy?

1823
01:40:20,291 --> 01:40:21,541
<i>That can't happen, Jay.</i>

1824
01:40:22,041 --> 01:40:24,583
-He's my friend.
-<i>Not anymore.</i>

1825
01:40:24,666 --> 01:40:26,833
<i>My counsel is to let it go.</i>

1826
01:40:26,916 --> 01:40:28,208
-Yeah?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

1827
01:40:28,291 --> 01:40:30,958
<i>It's settled.
You won't hear from him again.</i>

1828
01:40:31,041 --> 01:40:33,166
<i>Enjoy your tribute, Jay. You've earned it.</i>

1829
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:36,125
I want whiskey
and spaghetti <i>bolognese!</i>

1830
01:40:36,208 --> 01:40:39,708
Then we will eat spaghetti alla bolognese.

1831
01:40:39,791 --> 01:40:43,500
-Thanks, Alan.
-<i>Don't thank me. It was all Ron.</i>

1832
01:40:43,583 --> 01:40:45,333
<i>He really went to war for you.</i>

1833
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:49,458
Thanks, Alan.

1834
01:40:54,125 --> 01:40:57,916
You all can make up stories,
but you and I know who I am.

1835
01:40:58,708 --> 01:41:00,375
You know who I am, Ron?

1836
01:41:01,333 --> 01:41:04,625
-Who am I?
-Look at you. You're the American dream.

1837
01:41:04,708 --> 01:41:06,333
You're the last of the old movie stars...

1838
01:41:06,416 --> 01:41:08,750
-I'm down here.
-You're up there, you're down here.

1839
01:41:08,833 --> 01:41:11,917
You're in here. It's amazing.
We've accomplished so much together.

1840
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,458
Everything you say makes it worse.

1841
01:41:14,541 --> 01:41:17,916
You can stop running now, puppy.
It's time to go back to work.

1842
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,416
I'm going dancing.

1843
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:23,000
Oh! The famous Ron. Later? Later.

1844
01:41:23,083 --> 01:41:24,791
You start shooting on Monday,

1845
01:41:24,875 --> 01:41:27,666
and I gave them my word
you would be there.

1846
01:41:29,416 --> 01:41:31,041
Give my part to Ben Alcock.

1847
01:41:32,916 --> 01:41:35,250
Hey. Come here. Come here.

1848
01:41:35,333 --> 01:41:37,875
Do you know what I had to go through
to get you that job?

1849
01:41:37,958 --> 01:41:39,541
I mean, you're you.

1850
01:41:39,625 --> 01:41:42,292
But I was the one who went
to the Louis Brothers' tequila bar

1851
01:41:42,375 --> 01:41:43,791
in Bushwick and smoked crack.

1852
01:41:43,875 --> 01:41:45,000
It wasn't crack.

1853
01:41:45,083 --> 01:41:47,333
I don't know what it was, but I smoked it,

1854
01:41:47,416 --> 01:41:50,208
and for three hours, I was afraid
I was going to swallow my tongue.

1855
01:41:50,291 --> 01:41:52,792
-Anyways, it got you the job.
-They offered me the job.

1856
01:41:52,875 --> 01:41:55,541
The part was written
for a 35-year-old man.

1857
01:41:55,625 --> 01:41:57,291
It took some convincing.

1858
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:01,625
And I'd do it again,
because I think what you do is magic.

1859
01:42:02,208 --> 01:42:05,291
I'm just an actor, Ron.
An actor that got famous.

1860
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:12,125
Does none of this mean anything to you?
'Cause it means something to me.

1861
01:42:12,708 --> 01:42:14,667
Give my tribute to Ben. I'm goin' dancing.

1862
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:15,667
I don't understand.

1863
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:19,541
I think I've been a good partner,
a good friend. I loved you.

1864
01:42:19,625 --> 01:42:21,708
-I love you too, Ronnie.
-But are we friends?

1865
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:24,333
-Of course we are.
-Then be a friend to me.

1866
01:42:24,416 --> 01:42:26,083
And let's go back to work.

1867
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:29,833
I mean, you're Jay Kelly.
But I'm Jay Kelly too.

1868
01:42:29,916 --> 01:42:33,333
We did this together.
You actually said that to me one time.

1869
01:42:33,416 --> 01:42:34,708
You forgot.

1870
01:42:37,625 --> 01:42:39,083
I'm dancing.

1871
01:42:39,791 --> 01:42:43,500
When you fuck yourself,
you're fucking me, you understand?

1872
01:42:43,583 --> 01:42:44,416
I'm dancing.

1873
01:42:47,083 --> 01:42:49,125
You don't know how to be a friend!

1874
01:42:50,375 --> 01:42:53,125
You're my friend
who takes 15% of my income.

1875
01:42:57,333 --> 01:42:59,416
If you're not on that plane tomorrow...

1876
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:00,958
I'm dancing.

1877
01:43:01,916 --> 01:43:05,500
I wish... I wish you were the man
I thought you were.

1878
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:10,750
I'm a cocker spaniel
dancing in the Serengeti.

1879
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,208
Whoo!

1880
01:44:16,541 --> 01:44:17,500
Jay!

1881
01:44:17,583 --> 01:44:18,791
Jay!

1882
01:44:19,291 --> 01:44:20,125
Jay!

1883
01:44:20,791 --> 01:44:22,583
-Alba, you're an angel.
-Jay.

1884
01:44:22,666 --> 01:44:25,458
-Dance with me.
-Come. Your daddy is sick.

1885
01:44:26,041 --> 01:44:29,000
He is in the restaurant. Come on.

1886
01:44:33,833 --> 01:44:35,708
I think he drunk too much.

1887
01:44:35,791 --> 01:44:39,250
He was eating spaghetti and doing yoga,
and he lost his balance.

1888
01:44:39,333 --> 01:44:41,542
-Where is he?
-In the kitchen with the doctor.

1889
01:44:41,625 --> 01:44:42,708
Dad?

1890
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:50,500
Hey.

1891
01:44:52,583 --> 01:44:54,083
You doing okay there, Studly?

1892
01:44:55,541 --> 01:44:57,416
Heh. I lost my balance.

1893
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:00,833
-Is that blood?
-No. That's the <i>bolognese.</i>

1894
01:45:05,958 --> 01:45:06,958
He's fine.

1895
01:45:09,708 --> 01:45:11,625
-And too much wine.
-Uh-huh.

1896
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,250
He needs to rest.

1897
01:45:23,708 --> 01:45:24,583
Hey.

1898
01:45:25,958 --> 01:45:27,208
It's so bright in here.

1899
01:45:29,291 --> 01:45:30,375
Can I do anything?

1900
01:45:32,333 --> 01:45:34,000
I... I wish I'd seen Daisy.

1901
01:45:34,083 --> 01:45:34,958
Yeah.

1902
01:45:35,541 --> 01:45:37,375
You remember being 18.

1903
01:45:37,458 --> 01:45:41,333
You asked me that already.
I said I remember Brylcreem.

1904
01:45:41,416 --> 01:45:42,750
Right. Sorry.

1905
01:45:45,291 --> 01:45:47,625
-I want to go home now.
-Just get some sleep.

1906
01:45:47,708 --> 01:45:49,166
No, I want to leave now.

1907
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:51,708
-Stay. See Italy.
-I've seen it.

1908
01:45:52,291 --> 01:45:54,750
Audrey booked me
on the 8 a.m. flight from Pisa.

1909
01:45:57,541 --> 01:45:59,166
Are you pissed at me?

1910
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:00,250
No.

1911
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:04,750
I really want you to have a good time.
I want you to stay till tomorrow.

1912
01:46:04,833 --> 01:46:07,166
We never get a chance
to spend time together.

1913
01:46:11,166 --> 01:46:13,208
-The taxi is here.
-Y...

1914
01:46:13,291 --> 01:46:14,708
Stay for my tribute.

1915
01:46:20,083 --> 01:46:22,708
Come on, Dad. Please stay.

1916
01:46:25,166 --> 01:46:26,125
Where's my bag?

1917
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,416
It's in the taxi.

1918
01:46:36,625 --> 01:46:38,166
It was nice to meet you.

1919
01:46:38,250 --> 01:46:39,083
Hey.

1920
01:46:39,583 --> 01:46:40,958
-Bye, Alba.
<i>-Ciao.</i>

1921
01:46:43,125 --> 01:46:44,000
Hey.

1922
01:46:44,833 --> 01:46:47,375
-Thanks for the party, Studly.
-Dad. Come on.

1923
01:46:47,458 --> 01:46:48,958
Hey. Wait.

1924
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,500
Hey, Dad. Dad!

1925
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:52,833
Dad!

1926
01:46:53,458 --> 01:46:56,291
Come on!

1927
01:47:51,375 --> 01:47:53,666
Is that Jay Kelly?

1928
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:54,583
Hey.

1929
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:56,750
-You okay, man?
-Yeah. Hey. Hi.

1930
01:47:56,833 --> 01:47:59,125
Ah. Proud to be
sharing a tribute with you, <i>amigo.</i>

1931
01:47:59,208 --> 01:48:00,625
-Thanks, Ben.
-Hey.

1932
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:02,208
-You know my wife, Melanie.
-Yeah.

1933
01:48:02,291 --> 01:48:06,958
My daughters, Seraphina, Lily and Bridget,
my sons, Cassian and Cole...

1934
01:48:07,041 --> 01:48:09,875
You got Arlo over there,
the newest addition to the clan.

1935
01:48:09,958 --> 01:48:13,958
We got Nana and Nono, Terry and Ernie,
brother-in-law, Spike.

1936
01:48:14,041 --> 01:48:15,041
Big fan.

1937
01:48:15,125 --> 01:48:18,333
My assistant, Pam.
Sorry about the clown cars.

1938
01:48:18,416 --> 01:48:20,333
Sorry I don't have anybody
to introduce you to.

1939
01:48:20,416 --> 01:48:23,791
Hey, only in Italy would they give
two middle-aged white men an award.

1940
01:48:23,875 --> 01:48:25,708
I mean, seriously, at this moment?

1941
01:48:25,791 --> 01:48:27,792
I guess we got Ron to thank for that, huh?

1942
01:48:27,875 --> 01:48:31,375
Yeah, this is awkward,
but I parted ways with Ron.

1943
01:48:33,250 --> 01:48:35,333
-When?
-A few hours ago.

1944
01:48:35,416 --> 01:48:37,708
I feel terrible. I mean, I love the guy,

1945
01:48:37,791 --> 01:48:40,250
but I just felt like
I was being looked after

1946
01:48:40,333 --> 01:48:42,458
by someone who needs looking after.

1947
01:48:43,041 --> 01:48:46,041
I mean, every time
it's his kids and inflamed feet

1948
01:48:46,125 --> 01:48:47,666
or Lois and whatever that is.

1949
01:48:47,750 --> 01:48:50,583
God bless him, but I need
someone younger, someone hungrier.

1950
01:48:50,666 --> 01:48:53,291
-Or older and more powerful.
-Right.

1951
01:48:53,375 --> 01:48:56,458
You were also getting into all that
psycho dynamic stuff with him.

1952
01:48:56,541 --> 01:48:58,417
Yeah, yeah.
He's too much like my father.

1953
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:00,250
-Or he wants to be.
-Yeah.

1954
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:03,166
I have to keep saying to myself.
They are not our family.

1955
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:04,458
-Or your friend.
-No!

1956
01:49:04,541 --> 01:49:06,666
We give these guys 15% of everything,

1957
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:08,583
then they want to be treated
like our friend.

1958
01:49:08,666 --> 01:49:10,458
-Friends do not take 15%.
-No.

1959
01:49:10,541 --> 01:49:11,375
Huh.

1960
01:49:11,458 --> 01:49:15,208
-Oh. We heard about your act of bravery.
-Yeah! Nicely done, <i>amigo.</i>

1961
01:49:15,958 --> 01:49:17,916
-Ah, yeah.
-Jay Kelly for President!

1962
01:49:18,916 --> 01:49:21,000
No, I mean, seriously.
Would you ever run?

1963
01:49:21,083 --> 01:49:22,583
No, it's just...

1964
01:49:22,666 --> 01:49:24,125
I, uh...

1965
01:49:24,208 --> 01:49:26,166
Can you excuse me for a minute?

1966
01:49:27,208 --> 01:49:31,500
Uh, actually, we need a few extra tickets
for the fam, if you have any to spare.

1967
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:35,666
I can spare all of 'em, Ben.

1968
01:49:36,375 --> 01:49:37,692
Thanks, brother. I owe you.

1969
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:42,583
Maybe just leave me one.

1970
01:49:43,416 --> 01:49:44,708
Yeah, sure.

1971
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:50,750
Saddle up! Let's go!

1972
01:50:16,208 --> 01:50:19,291
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hey, Jess, it's Dad.

1973
01:50:19,791 --> 01:50:22,750
<i>-Hi.</i>
-Hey, uh, is this a good time to talk?

1974
01:50:23,458 --> 01:50:26,916
<i>-What's up?</i>
-Well, I'm in Italy.

1975
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,750
<i>-I read about your real-life heroics.</i>
-Ah, it's a news story. It's not true.

1976
01:50:31,833 --> 01:50:34,625
<i>-Yeah, well, you fooled them again.</i>
-Yeah.

1977
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:37,541
<i>-So why are you calling?</i>
-Well, listen.

1978
01:50:38,583 --> 01:50:41,042
I'm feelin' bad about
the last time we were together.

1979
01:50:41,125 --> 01:50:42,625
Sorry about that.

1980
01:50:43,666 --> 01:50:47,291
I just couldn't take that guy.
Are you still seeing him?

1981
01:50:47,375 --> 01:50:48,541
Yes.

1982
01:50:49,375 --> 01:50:52,166
Well, I wanna hear you out, so...

1983
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:54,916
-if that's what you need to happen, and...
-Uh-huh.

1984
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,666
Listen, I have this tribute here
in Tuscany. I'd love for you to come.

1985
01:50:59,750 --> 01:51:02,500
-Since when do you care about a tribute?
-Well...

1986
01:51:02,583 --> 01:51:04,541
Good question. I...

1987
01:51:05,583 --> 01:51:07,416
I did make those movies.

1988
01:51:08,666 --> 01:51:12,958
So you think that if I go
and I celebrate your career,

1989
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:15,250
that your brilliance
is gonna make me forgive you?

1990
01:51:15,333 --> 01:51:17,708
-No. No.
-Maybe yes, Jay.

1991
01:51:17,791 --> 01:51:19,833
Well... Maybe yes.

1992
01:51:20,583 --> 01:51:22,458
It's 35 years of my life.

1993
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:27,833
-I'm 34.
-I just want you to come with me.

1994
01:51:28,541 --> 01:51:31,583
To see what I did.
To be there to celebrate.

1995
01:51:31,666 --> 01:51:33,416
It's got to have meant something.

1996
01:51:36,791 --> 01:51:38,166
What if it didn't?

1997
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:47,791
I could've been a very good dad
to you, Jess.

1998
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:51,416
I wanted to, you know.

1999
01:51:52,875 --> 01:51:56,666
It's just things with your mother
and distance,

2000
01:51:56,750 --> 01:52:00,333
and I didn't execute it
the way I planned it.

2001
01:52:00,416 --> 01:52:02,833
-That's just...
-Just be honest with me, Jay.

2002
01:52:03,333 --> 01:52:07,083
Stop rationalizing
and trying to defend yourself.

2003
01:52:07,166 --> 01:52:08,583
Just stop.

2004
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:17,208
I was young.
And I wanted something very badly,

2005
01:52:17,291 --> 01:52:20,875
and I was afraid that if I took
my eye off of it, I couldn't have it.

2006
01:52:20,958 --> 01:52:22,375
And I was right.

2007
01:52:23,125 --> 01:52:24,708
There was no other way to do it.

2008
01:52:28,875 --> 01:52:30,416
And it meant choosing...

2009
01:52:31,833 --> 01:52:33,041
it over you.

2010
01:52:34,458 --> 01:52:36,214
But it was supposed to be temporary.

2011
01:52:37,333 --> 01:52:38,375
Just...

2012
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:42,041
until I had what I wanted. And...

2013
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,416
But then I had to keep it.

2014
01:52:49,666 --> 01:52:52,375
My ten-year-old self
is giving you the finger.

2015
01:52:53,666 --> 01:52:55,208
What about you now?

2016
01:52:57,375 --> 01:52:59,125
You don't have to worry about me, Dad.

2017
01:52:59,208 --> 01:53:02,583
I'm okay. I love what I do.
I have friends.

2018
01:53:02,666 --> 01:53:05,125
I'm gonna have a good life,
just not with you.

2019
01:53:06,458 --> 01:53:08,583
And you're okay too, you know?

2020
01:53:08,666 --> 01:53:10,958
You're...
You're a good movie star, you know?

2021
01:53:11,041 --> 01:53:12,666
You make a lot of people happy.

2022
01:53:16,958 --> 01:53:19,000
I think I'm gonna quit acting.

2023
01:53:19,083 --> 01:53:22,250
I need you to sign a photo
for Theo's teacher. She's a big fan.

2024
01:53:22,333 --> 01:53:23,375
What? Oh.

2025
01:53:23,458 --> 01:53:25,583
Okay. Jess, it'd mean so much to me...

2026
01:53:25,666 --> 01:53:26,916
-For Helen.
-What?

2027
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,625
-That's her name. Helen.
-Okay. Helen.

2028
01:53:30,125 --> 01:53:31,417
-I'm sorry, Dad.
-Please, Jess...

2029
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:34,291
Theo's calling,
and I hope you have a good tribute.

2030
01:53:34,791 --> 01:53:35,875
<i>Good-bye, Jay.</i>

2031
01:53:36,375 --> 01:53:37,291
Jess!

2032
01:55:06,833 --> 01:55:11,250
Oh! The famous Ron!
Have you seen Jay Kelly?

2033
01:55:11,875 --> 01:55:15,416
Not since last night.

2034
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:21,125
-See you later.
-The tribute is at 5. Precise!

2035
01:55:21,208 --> 01:55:22,208
<i>Grazie.</i>

2036
01:55:50,541 --> 01:55:54,458
Ron! Hey! Ron.

2037
01:55:55,833 --> 01:55:56,666
Hey.

2038
01:56:05,375 --> 01:56:09,125
-Pull over. Stop, stop, stop.
-Okay.

2039
01:56:15,708 --> 01:56:17,166
Are you okay?

2040
01:56:20,250 --> 01:56:21,583
Take a second.

2041
01:56:23,916 --> 01:56:24,833
It's okay.

2042
01:56:35,791 --> 01:56:38,625
Look, I'm sorry about...

2043
01:56:42,125 --> 01:56:43,291
I'm sorry.

2044
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:47,041
Um...

2045
01:56:47,125 --> 01:56:48,458
I appreciate it.

2046
01:56:52,291 --> 01:56:53,833
But you got me thinking.

2047
01:56:55,291 --> 01:56:59,125
I was up all last night, talkin' to Lois.

2048
01:57:00,125 --> 01:57:01,916
And I think you have it right.

2049
01:57:03,416 --> 01:57:05,750
There comes a point
when you have to reassess.

2050
01:57:10,208 --> 01:57:12,666
I love you. I really do.

2051
01:57:15,583 --> 01:57:17,500
And I appreciate the apology.

2052
01:57:17,583 --> 01:57:18,541
But I...

2053
01:57:19,541 --> 01:57:21,250
I can't work with you anymore.

2054
01:57:23,166 --> 01:57:24,833
It's not good for me.

2055
01:57:28,458 --> 01:57:29,958
The Italians are lookin' for you.

2056
01:57:30,041 --> 01:57:32,416
You have a tribute starting
in a couple of hours.

2057
01:57:34,916 --> 01:57:37,541
I gotta make a plane,
but try and go, okay?

2058
01:57:40,125 --> 01:57:42,000
I mean, you came all this way.

2059
01:57:46,041 --> 01:57:47,458
Hey, Ron?

2060
01:57:54,208 --> 01:57:57,291
Come to the tribute with me.
As my friend.

2061
01:58:01,375 --> 01:58:02,666
I mean...

2062
01:58:04,958 --> 01:58:06,375
we did this together.

2063
01:58:14,125 --> 01:58:16,125
You're the one I want there most of all.

2064
01:58:22,666 --> 01:58:24,500
I'm the only one who is here.

2065
02:00:55,625 --> 02:00:57,000
Look at this here.

2066
02:00:58,666 --> 02:00:59,541
They came.

2067
02:01:04,458 --> 02:01:05,958
That's great.

2068
02:01:17,875 --> 02:01:20,041
WINNER OF THE STRAWBERRY TREE AWARD
JAY KELLY

2069
02:01:35,041 --> 02:01:36,416
<i>Well, hello.</i>

2070
02:01:44,791 --> 02:01:46,000
<i>Who the hell is this?</i>

2071
02:01:48,541 --> 02:01:49,541
<i>Here we go.</i>

2072
02:01:52,583 --> 02:01:54,417
<i>I prefer to think of myself
as a family man,</i>

2073
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:57,329
<i>and that's what we all are here,
whether we like it or not.</i>

2074
02:01:58,041 --> 02:01:59,500
<i>We are a family.</i>

2075
02:01:59,583 --> 02:02:03,144
<i>That doesn't matter now, 'cause
you got about two fuckin' seconds to live!</i>

2076
02:02:06,083 --> 02:02:09,205
<i>Now you really didn't think
I was gonna sit this one out, did ya?</i>

2077
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:14,875
<i>The way this works is, you do
the thing you're scared shitless of,</i>

2078
02:02:14,958 --> 02:02:16,909
<i>and you get the courage after you do it.</i>

2079
02:02:18,333 --> 02:02:19,601
<i>I won't let you down, sir.</i>

2080
02:02:28,833 --> 02:02:29,906
<i>So what's it gonna be?</i>

2081
02:02:30,625 --> 02:02:32,083
<i>Yes or no answer.</i>

2082
02:02:33,166 --> 02:02:35,041
<i>That's what I call a fucking show!</i>

2083
02:02:41,583 --> 02:02:42,708
<i>I stand before you...</i>

2084
02:02:44,916 --> 02:02:45,750
<i>naked.</i>

2085
02:04:02,708 --> 02:04:05,541
<i>Dad, it's not over yet.
It's</i> The...

2086
02:04:05,625 --> 02:04:07,416
Kelly and Kelly Show!

2087
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:11,708
<i>-Starring Kelly!
-And Kelly!</i>

2088
02:04:12,750 --> 02:04:18,708
<i>And now it's time for
Daisy Genevieve Kelly's famous front roll!</i>

2089
02:04:24,125 --> 02:04:26,208
-Dad! It's not over!
-And Jessica...

2090
02:04:26,291 --> 02:04:29,541
Hilary Kelly will do
her more famous cartwheel.

2091
02:04:32,083 --> 02:04:35,458
And now for some magic.
Dad! It's not over.

2092
02:04:39,583 --> 02:04:41,708
-What do we do now?
-Kelly!

2093
02:04:42,708 --> 02:04:45,166
And now... Wait, Dad! You're missing it!

2094
02:04:45,250 --> 02:04:47,833
For Daisy's...
Dad, you're gonna miss it!

2095
02:04:48,416 --> 02:04:52,833
Now, for Daisy's
Hollywood-renowned Charleston.

2096
02:05:06,166 --> 02:05:07,416
Okay, there we are.

2097
02:05:07,916 --> 02:05:10,958
And Jessica's California-renowned tap.

2098
02:05:15,166 --> 02:05:17,500
Kelly!

2099
02:05:18,875 --> 02:05:19,833
Sorry.

2100
02:05:19,916 --> 02:05:22,666
-Kelly and Kelly!
-No, it's Kelly and Kelly.

2101
02:05:22,750 --> 02:05:26,916
<i>-No, it's Kelly and Kelly.
-No, it's Kelly and Kelly.</i>

2102
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,416
<i>-No, it's Kelly and Kel-ly.
-It's Kelly and Kelly.</i>

2103
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:32,500
<i>Watch the telly, smelly Kelly.</i>

2104
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:10,166
Can I go again?

2105
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,833
I'd like another one.
