MINSK
BELARUS

2
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:19,198
Benji.

3
00:01:20,343 --> 00:01:21,508
Benji, do you copy?

4
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,009
Benji.

5
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,896
Oh.
Shit.

6
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:27,677
Where's Ethan?

7
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:29,674
Uh.
I can't talk right now.

8
00:01:30,026 --> 00:01:31,796
The package is on the plane.

9
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:33,538
Yeah, I know.

10
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:37,394
We're currently formulate a plan B
although technically, it's a plan C.

11
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,176
This isn't going very well.

12
00:01:39,505 --> 00:01:41,185
I am aware of that, Brandt.
You're not helping.

13
00:01:41,608 --> 00:01:42,207
Where's Ethan?

14
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,757
I don't know.
We're on radio silence.

15
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:46,654
That plane cannot takeoff,
with the package on it.

16
00:01:47,047 --> 00:01:48,143
You understand?
- We're working on it.

17
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:50,855
Luther? What the hell
are you doing there?

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,745
You are supposed to be on
an assignment in Malaysia.

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,634
I'm in Malaysia, I've been here 2 days.
Benji needed my help.

20
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:59,046
I didn't need help. I just-
I needed assistance, it's a different thing.

21
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:00,579
The package is still
on that plane.

22
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:04,838
We understand the package
is on the plane.

23
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:07,221
We're trying to cripple it remotely.
- You can do that.

24
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,792
We can if the pilot left the
satellite uplink switch on.

25
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:12,636
Which he has.
- And how do you access the uplink?

26
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:16,070
It involves hacking a Russian satellite.
- I can't authorise that.

27
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:17,822
Which is why
I didn't ask permission.

28
00:02:18,353 --> 00:02:20,201
We are under investigation
for misconduct.

29
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:22,863
The package is on-board.
What do you want me to do?

30
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:33,304
Uh.
Luther.

31
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:36,498
I'm reading a heat bloom, Benji.
The engines are starting.

32
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:37,732
Yeah.
I'm aware of that.

33
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:40,452
But I can't do anything until
I'm connected to the satellite.

34
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:43,426
Benji, you are connected.
- Okay, Great.

35
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:46,876
The package is still
on that plane.

36
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:49,173
Shut down the fuel pump.

37
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:51,834
Uh.
Mechanical are lockdown.

38
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:54,225
What about the electrical system?
- Oh, that might work.

39
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:55,986
No.
No.

40
00:02:56,322 --> 00:02:57,242
Hydraulics.
- Okay, standby.

41
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:58,883
No, they're encrypted.

42
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:02,515
Benji, the plane.

43
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,052
Yes! The package
is on the plane!

44
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:05,394
We get it!

45
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:08,573
Can you open the door?

46
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:11,681
Ethan? Where are you?
- I'm by the plane.

47
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:13,443
Benji, can you open the door?

48
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:15,797
Uh. Can I open the door?
Uh. Maybe.

49
00:03:15,832 --> 00:03:17,836
Open the door when I tell you.

50
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:34,850
I'm on the plane.
Open the door.

51
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,015
How did you
get in the plane?

52
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,786
Not in the plane,
I'm on the plane!

53
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:41,078
Open the door!

54
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:47,643
Benji.
Open the door!

55
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,973
Yeah-yeah-yeah...
Okay, okay.

56
00:03:54,471 --> 00:03:56,980
Benji, open that door right now!
- Yeah, I am trying.

57
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,556
Come on, Benji.
- Benji, open that door!

58
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:16,971
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

59
00:04:22,473 --> 00:04:24,379
Come on.
Yes, got it.

60
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:31,815
That's the wrong door!

61
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,102
Benji, not that door.
The other door.

62
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:35,926
The other door.
Right. Yes, the other door.

63
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:38,224
Okay, yes, yes. Sorry, sorry.
My bad, my bad.

64
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,859
Check it out.

65
00:04:46,056 --> 00:04:48,080
Alright. Look, I'm gonna
open the para-door.

66
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:49,931
How's that?

67
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:19,818
Hey.
Hey.

68
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:06,325
MISION:IMPOSIBLE
Nation secreta

69
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:08,956
LONDON
ENGLAND

70
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:37,742
We're about to close.

71
00:06:38,177 --> 00:06:39,700
I won't be long.

72
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:42,156
You looking for
anything in particular.

73
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,834
Something rare.

74
00:06:48,873 --> 00:06:50,460
Let me guess.

75
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,045
Classical.

76
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,827
Jazz.

77
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:56,871
Sax.
- Coltrain.

78
00:06:56,994 --> 00:06:59,023
Piano.
- Monk.

79
00:06:59,191 --> 00:07:01,560
Shadow Wilson on the bass.

80
00:07:01,764 --> 00:07:03,936
Shadow Wilson played drums.

81
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,883
Know why
they called him Shadow?

82
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:09,681
Because he had a light touch.

83
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:12,282
You're in luck.

84
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,092
I've a first pressing.

85
00:07:24,663 --> 00:07:26,946
It really is you.

86
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:31,650
I've heard stories.

87
00:07:31,882 --> 00:07:34,117
They can't all be true.

88
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:57,555
Good even, Mr. Hunt.

89
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,307
The weapons you recovered in Belarus
were confirmed to be VX nerve gas.

90
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:04,057
Capable of devastating
a major city.

91
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:05,929
The bodies of the air crew
were found less than

92
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:08,847
24 hours after they
landed in Damascus.

93
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:11,890
They were identified as
low level Chechen separatist.

94
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:13,789
With neither the
access nor the ability

95
00:08:13,814 --> 00:08:16,929
to acquire the weapons
they were transporting.

96
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,673
This would support your suspicion

97
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,926
that a shadow organization is
committed to inciting revolution.

98
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,137
by enabling acts of terror in
nations friendly to Western interests.

99
00:08:26,163 --> 00:08:29,141
IMF suspects this to be the
same shadow organization

100
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,425
you have been tracking
for the last year

101
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,814
Also known as the Syndicate.

102
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,219
IMF would be right.

103
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:38,495
Normally, you and your
team would be tasked

104
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,486
with infiltrating and disrupting
this terrorist network,

105
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:45,164
but we have taken steps to
ensure that this will not happen.

106
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:47,850
Because, we, are the Syndicate,
Mr. Hunt.

107
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,563
And now we know
who you are.

108
00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:52,890
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,

109
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:54,540
is to face your fate.

110
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:58,724
Pursue us, you'll be caught.
Resist us, you'll be killed.

111
00:08:58,749 --> 00:09:02,900
And you precious Secretary will
disavow any knowledge of your actions.

112
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:04,245
Good luck, Mr. Hunt.

113
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,163
This message will self destruct
in 5 seconds.

114
00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:03,012
Mr. Chairman, the IMF's misadventures
date back to my earliest days in the CIA

115
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:07,696
when the IMF broke into the CIA
to steal a list of covert operatives.

116
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:10,708
And now, more recently a Russian warhead.
- Disarmed Russian warhead.

117
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:13,527
A Russian nuclear warhead.
- Branded safe by Th IMF.

118
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:17,522
Clipped the Transamerica Pyramid
before plunging into the San Francisco bay.

119
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:18,484
Saving the western atmosphere.

120
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:21,041
This made possible by IMF
agents who did willing

121
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:24,179
provide the launch codes
to a known terrorist.

122
00:10:24,204 --> 00:10:26,288
Do I have that right, agent Brandt?

123
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,326
I can neither confirm nor deny details of any
such operation without Secretary's approval.

124
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:34,715
This was the same week after
IMF infiltrated the Kremlin.

125
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,600
Here's the Kremlin before.

126
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:40,399
And the Kremlin after.

127
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:45,895
I can neither confirm nor
deny details of any operation...

128
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,141
Without the Secretary's approval.
Yes, we know.

129
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,670
In fact, until this panel
appoints a new Secretary,

130
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,395
you really can't say much of anything,
can you, agent Brandt?

131
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,176
Well.
I didn't write the rules, Mr. Hunley.

132
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:56,718
Mr. Chairman, the so call
Impossible Missions Force

133
00:10:56,753 --> 00:11:00,460
is not just a rogue organization,
it is an outdated one.

134
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:04,236
A throwback to an era without
transparency and without oversight.

135
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:06,869
Mr. Chairman.
- The time has come to dissolve the IMF.

136
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:10,845
Mr. Chairman.
- And transfer the salvageable assets to the CIA.

137
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,094
Mr. Chairman, the IMF has operated
without oversight for 40 years.

138
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:16,165
Now, are its methods unorthodox? Yes.
- Mr. Chairman.

139
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,557
Are it's results less than perfect?
Absolutely.

140
00:11:19,592 --> 00:11:22,499
But without the IMF, to be force...
- There'll be order and stability.

141
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:23,706
Without the IMF...

142
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:29,865
This panel recognizes the IMF's
contribution to global security.

143
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,863
But the events laid out by
CIA director Hunley

144
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:37,275
also show a pattern of
once and brinkmanship

145
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,497
and a total disregard for protocol.

146
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:41,137
From where I sit,

147
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:44,889
you unorthodox methods are
indistinguishable from chance.

148
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,794
And your results,
perfect or not,

149
00:11:48,144 --> 00:11:50,219
looked suspiciously like luck.

150
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,841
I'm afraid today is the day
when the IMF's luck runs out.

151
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:37,527
What are you doing here?

152
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:39,588
Huh?

153
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,660
I said: "What are you doing here?"

154
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,100
What does he see in you,
I wonder.

155
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,189
Who is he?

156
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,025
I want to see what is done.

157
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,427
Why don't you
take off the cuffs.

158
00:14:07,518 --> 00:14:09,009
And I'll show you.

159
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:10,959
Vinter.

160
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:16,544
You know who I am?

161
00:14:16,842 --> 00:14:18,343
Janik Vinter.

162
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:22,173
They call you,
the bone doctor.

163
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,685
The funny thing is.

164
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:29,709
You're officially declared dead,
3 years ago.

165
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:32,006
Nice shoes by the way.

166
00:14:33,936 --> 00:14:35,790
Not his.

167
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,487
Yours.

168
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:46,722
We have instructions to talk,

169
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:48,194
not to kill him.

170
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:51,345
There are men who are
broken in different ways.

171
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:54,867
This one's a fighter.

172
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:57,492
He'll die,
before you turn him.

173
00:14:57,517 --> 00:15:00,290
Are you worry he's
gonna take your place?

174
00:15:10,814 --> 00:15:15,299
You should go,
before it gets ugly.

175
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:19,946
Yeah, he's right.

176
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:21,993
You should go.

177
00:15:35,611 --> 00:15:38,867
Now, let's see how tough you are.

178
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:42,009
You, Janik.

179
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:07,245
We've never met before, right?

180
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:10,777
Follow me.

181
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,509
Give me the gun.

182
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:26,647
What're you doing?
- I can't leave.

183
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,741
Look. You can't stay.
We just killed those men.

184
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:30,947
We didn't kill them.
You did.

185
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:34,557
I tried to stop you.
You got away.

186
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:37,694
Who are you?

187
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:40,835
You better hurry now.
Good luck.

188
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,527
No, wait.
Wait!

189
00:17:42,552 --> 00:17:43,682
Where is he?

190
00:17:43,707 --> 00:17:46,196
He's heading to the north corridor.
He has closed the gate.

191
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:49,392
Hurry, don't let him escape.
Quick!

192
00:18:01,304 --> 00:18:03,944
Stack-com 7.
- Western Europe unsecured.

193
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:06,441
Designator.
- Bravo Echo One One.

194
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:08,223
Connecting.

195
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:10,568
This is Brandt.
- Go secure.

196
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:12,846
Go.

197
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:16,262
London terminal is compromised.
Repeat, London is compromised.

198
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:19,271
Agent placed is down.
Request immediate extraction.

199
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:21,301
What happened?
Who breached London?

200
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:22,980
Do you've anything to go on?

201
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:26,821
A face. He wanted something.
Not information.

202
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:29,927
He could've kill me,
but he didn't.

203
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:33,610
Okay, what do you think it means.
- The Syndicate is real.

204
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:36,398
They know who we're,
how we operate.

205
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:39,141
I think I know why
they've been so hard to find.

206
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:44,304
Just focus operations on gathering any available
Intel regarding formal covert operatives.

207
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:46,364
It doesn't matter what
country or agency.

208
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:48,830
Just as long as they are dead
Or presumed dead.

209
00:18:48,855 --> 00:18:53,618
Start with Janik Vinter.
He's also known as the bone doctor.

210
00:18:53,643 --> 00:18:55,930
I can't do that.
- What?

211
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:57,967
What're you talking about?

212
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:00,208
The Committee has shut us down.

213
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:03,407
Operations are to be
handled over to the CIA.

214
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:05,166
There is no more IMF.

215
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,966
I've been ordered
to bring everyone in.

216
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:10,748
Ethan.
- I understand.

217
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:13,137
Ethan.
- I understand, Brandt.

218
00:19:13,162 --> 00:19:15,123
We didn't have this conversation.

219
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:18,286
I disappeared in London.
You don't know where I am.

220
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:19,875
If I'm dead or alive.

221
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,428
This man you saw.
Can you find him?

222
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:26,530
I won't stop until I do.

223
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:29,924
This may very well be
our last mission, Ethan.

224
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:31,584
Make it count.

225
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:33,303
Brandt.

226
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:53,836
Since we are going
to be work together,

227
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:56,520
I want you to choose your
next works very carefully.

228
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:57,663
Where is Hunt?

229
00:19:57,688 --> 00:19:59,614
I don't know.
- Don't lie to me, Brandt.

230
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:01,395
I have no way of contacting him.

231
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,226
He's deep cover. Last I heard,
he's tracking the Syndicate.

232
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:05,559
Let's cut the bull.

233
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:08,608
You know who we are.
You know what we are capable of.

234
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:13,448
How come the CIA has never discovered
any actual Intel regarding this Syndicate.

235
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:16,130
What are you implying?
- Not implying, stating.

236
00:20:16,155 --> 00:20:18,419
Leveling an accusation actually.

237
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:22,032
Hunt is both arsonist and fireman
at the same time.

238
00:20:22,057 --> 00:20:24,666
I believe that the Syndicate
is a figment of his imagination.

239
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,974
Created to justify
the IMF's existence.

240
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:30,349
I'm going to find him, Brandt.
And when I do,

241
00:20:30,374 --> 00:20:36,769
he will be called upon to answer for every
wanton active mayhem he's responsible for.

242
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:40,811
Welcome to the CIA.

243
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:43,784
You'll never find him.

244
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,654
Set your watch, Brandt.

245
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,173
Ethan Hunt is living his
last day as a free man.

246
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:52,221
6 months later

247
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:55,311
HAVANA,
CUBA

248
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,033
CIA
LANGLEY, VIRGINIA

249
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:05,198
All right, everybody.
Heads up.

250
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:06,897
This is it.

251
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:09,327
Alpha team prep.
Standing by.

252
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,367
Execute.
- Langley brimstone, go.

253
00:21:11,392 --> 00:21:13,606
I say again.
We are a go.

254
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,250
Langley, there's nobody here.

255
00:22:18,508 --> 00:22:22,198
Langley brimstone.
Face the north wall.

256
00:22:32,762 --> 00:22:34,593
ANOTHER ONE VANISHES
HERE IS FLIGHT 606?

257
00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:36,608
FIRE GUTS CHEMICAL

WORLD BANK
DECLARES CRISIS

259
00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:16,188
B. Dunn

260
00:23:20,722 --> 00:23:22,603
VIENNA OPERA

261
00:23:22,628 --> 00:23:24,572
YOU'VE
WON!

262
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:30,616
Dunn.

263
00:23:31,698 --> 00:23:34,766
Is it that time already.
Okay.

264
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,454
I'm going to ask you
a series of control questions.

265
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:40,153
I know and I'm gonna
answer truthfully.

266
00:23:40,178 --> 00:23:42,715
And then you gonna ask
me to lie intentionally.

267
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,703
State your name.
- The King of Norway.

268
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:47,693
See, that's a lie.

269
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,487
I'm actually third in line
to the throne.

270
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,150
My brother was...

271
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:53,651
Has Ethan Hunt contacted you?
- Why would he contact me?

272
00:23:53,676 --> 00:23:56,514
Hunt has resurfaced.
This time in Cuba.

273
00:23:56,539 --> 00:24:00,497
He...
left these behind.

274
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,904
Tell me what you
make of them.

275
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:04,908
I don't know.
He's taken up scrap booking?

276
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:06,812
Look at the photographs, Dunn.

277
00:24:06,837 --> 00:24:09,704
All of them are either
missing or dead, everyone.

278
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:11,328
All of them were
government agents.

279
00:24:11,353 --> 00:24:14,370
Russian, French, British, Israelis,
you name it.

280
00:24:14,395 --> 00:24:17,661
These are highly classified files and yet
Hunt had no problem collecting them.

281
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:20,736
And he always seems
to be a step ahead of us.

282
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:23,124
I wonder how?
- Are you suggesting I'm helping him?

283
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:25,349
That thought had cross my mind.

284
00:24:25,374 --> 00:24:27,072
6 months, I have been here.

285
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:31,129
Sifting through mountains of metadata
and exabytes of encoded excrement.

286
00:24:31,154 --> 00:24:35,206
I had decrypted, processed, passed
more data than anyone in my section.

287
00:24:35,231 --> 00:24:37,173
And yet every week,
you hold me in here.

288
00:24:37,198 --> 00:24:40,153
And you ask me the same question,
just in a different way.

289
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:43,702
And today,
you haven't answered it.

290
00:24:45,437 --> 00:24:49,310
You seem to thinks I have
some kind of obligation to him.

291
00:24:49,335 --> 00:24:51,931
Okay, nothing could be
further from the truth.

292
00:24:51,956 --> 00:24:58,672
Ethan Hunt is still out there in the field,
and I'm stuck here answering for it

293
00:24:58,774 --> 00:25:01,164
We're not friends.

294
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,144
I owe him nothing.

295
00:25:09,698 --> 00:25:12,224
That'll be all, Dunn.

296
00:26:10,317 --> 00:26:12,826
Welcome to Vienna, Benji.
Missed me?

297
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:14,921
Ethan, where are you?
Where the hell have you been?

298
00:26:14,946 --> 00:26:17,111
No act... you know what? Please,
don't tell me that,

299
00:26:17,136 --> 00:26:20,103
because it's just another thing I would have
to lie about in my weekly polygraph.

300
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:22,326
Everything is going to be fine.
Just keep walking.

301
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:24,692
But, make sure you're
not being follow. ed

302
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:27,649
Oh. I didn't win those opera tickets, did I?
- No, I'm afraid not

303
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:29,632
So, where do we meet?
- We don't.

304
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:32,507
For your sake,
we shouldn't be seen together.

305
00:26:32,532 --> 00:26:34,124
You have mail.

306
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:37,086
Who is he?
- That's what we're here to find out.

307
00:26:37,142 --> 00:26:40,260
What I do know, is he's our only
possible link to the Syndicate

308
00:26:40,863 --> 00:26:43,261
and I have reason to believe that
he's going to be here tonight.

309
00:26:43,286 --> 00:26:46,479
But I can't find him alone.
Are you in?

310
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,835
Are you in?
- Yes, of course. Of course.

311
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,328
So, what's the play?
- Simple. You find him, we tag him.

312
00:26:53,353 --> 00:26:56,254
I follow him wherever he goes.
- And after that?

313
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:59,339
After that you're on a plane,
back at work Monday morning.

314
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:02,676
No one is the wiser.
- What? That's it?

315
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:04,271
You're in enough
danger as it is.

316
00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:06,890
I didn't want to involve you
this much but I had no choice.

317
00:27:06,915 --> 00:27:08,709
Whoa. If you're gonna bring me
all this way,

318
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:12,311
you could at least give me something
a little be more... you know, dramatic.

319
00:27:12,336 --> 00:27:15,319
Benji, we are trying
to keep a low profile.

320
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:19,003
You want drama, go to the opera.

321
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:50,663
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- Yes, I am.

322
00:27:56,727 --> 00:28:00,018
Am I correct in assuming that is
the Chancellor of Austria?

323
00:28:00,043 --> 00:28:03,546
Yes, you are.
- Did you know he's going to be here?

324
00:28:03,571 --> 00:28:05,231
No
- Right.

325
00:28:05,256 --> 00:28:07,580
Well. We have a European
Heads of State here,

326
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:11,119
at the same time as we're
looking for a nefarious terrorist.

327
00:28:11,144 --> 00:28:14,684
And I'm sure the two things are completely unrelated.
- Benji.

328
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:19,636
Mean while I'll try and overlook the fact that you're an international fugitive wanted by the CIA.
- Benji.

329
00:28:19,661 --> 00:28:23,222
And this little unsanctioned operation
is tenement-ed treasonous. - Benji.

330
00:28:23,247 --> 00:28:24,567
Because as you stated earlier,

331
00:28:24,592 --> 00:28:26,406
I will be back in my desk
on Monday morning,

332
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:29,328
playing video games and no one
will be any be the wiser.

333
00:28:29,353 --> 00:28:31,080
The show's about to start, Benji.
- Right.

334
00:28:31,105 --> 00:28:33,947
Just take your position, tell me what you see.
- Okay.

335
00:28:33,972 --> 00:28:36,278
Nice tux, by the way.

336
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:57,191
Stage is set.
Ready lights.

337
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,402
Ready lights.

338
00:29:05,873 --> 00:29:08,632
The final preparations ready.

339
00:29:08,657 --> 00:29:10,908
Stay alert, please.

340
00:29:44,689 --> 00:29:49,160
Join the IMF. See the world,
on a monitor

341
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:50,987
in a closet.

342
00:30:32,603 --> 00:30:35,006
Okay, I have eyes.

343
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:36,793
Searching

344
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:41,889
Talk to me, Benji.
- Nothing yet. Standby.

345
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:47,943
I know you're here.
Where're you.

346
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:55,657
Uh Ethan, I might have something for you.
Can't confirm.

347
00:31:55,682 --> 00:31:58,512
Where?
- Backstage, I will direct you

348
00:32:05,477 --> 00:32:09,840
Take the door on your left.
He should be right in front of you.

349
00:32:50,611 --> 00:32:53,596
Benji, did you see that?
- See what?

350
00:32:54,213 --> 00:32:55,307
A woman.

351
00:32:55,332 --> 00:32:57,085
What woman?
Where're you?

352
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,991
I can't see you.

353
00:35:16,498 --> 00:35:19,917
What happened?
- I don't know

354
00:35:32,892 --> 00:35:35,793
Ethan, do you copy?
Ethan, come in.

355
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:00,393
Ethan, the lighting booth.
Ethan, do you copy?

356
00:38:00,418 --> 00:38:01,915
Oh god.

357
00:39:27,693 --> 00:39:29,907
It's a flash wound.

358
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:06,966
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

359
00:40:11,616 --> 00:40:15,254
Surround the building.
Secure the exits.

360
00:40:16,945 --> 00:40:20,828
I've a way out.
Interested?

361
00:40:21,872 --> 00:40:23,670
Lead the way.

362
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,960
Anything you want to tell me?
- No, not right now.

363
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:38,173
How's the pace?
- Don't wait for me.

364
00:40:45,991 --> 00:40:47,917
What's next?

365
00:40:49,244 --> 00:40:50,783
Alright.

366
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,672
There.

367
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:02,103
Shoes.

368
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:04,366
Shoes, please.

369
00:42:00,255 --> 00:42:01,582
If anything happens to you...

370
00:42:01,607 --> 00:42:04,435
Nothing is going to happen to me.

371
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:06,746
Stop the car!

372
00:42:14,637 --> 00:42:16,322
Get in.

373
00:42:17,928 --> 00:42:19,738
Go go go.

374
00:42:27,335 --> 00:42:30,013
What the...!
She tried to shoot me.

375
00:42:30,038 --> 00:42:32,712
It doesn't make her
a bad person.

376
00:42:32,829 --> 00:42:35,459
I'm gonna have to search you.
- You have to let me go.

377
00:42:35,484 --> 00:42:37,002
Oh oh.
Not a chance.

378
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:40,664
I assume you're deep cover back in London
but isn't this taking the role a little too far.

379
00:42:40,689 --> 00:42:41,867
Hang on a minute,
you know her?

380
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,995
Oh.
We haven't formerly introduced.

381
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,415
But I am pretty sure
she's British intelligence.

382
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,377
Ilsa Faust.
You're Ethan Hunt.

383
00:42:49,402 --> 00:42:53,370
And... that shade is
very hard to find.

384
00:42:53,406 --> 00:42:56,555
What were you doing at the opera tonight?
- What? Aside from killing the Chancellor.

385
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:00,739
Saving your life in London put me in a
tight spot with some very dangerous people.

386
00:43:00,764 --> 00:43:03,236
I was sent to kill the Chancellor
to regain their trust.

387
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:04,954
Ha. So, you admit
that you killed him?

388
00:43:04,979 --> 00:43:08,120
I went through the motion,
that's not the same thing.

389
00:43:08,145 --> 00:43:11,188
You thought you put him in the hospital,
take him out of harm's way.

390
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,903
The same thing
you tried to do.

391
00:43:12,928 --> 00:43:15,353
You're not gonna believe that, are you?
What about the rest of her team?

392
00:43:15,378 --> 00:43:19,233
You means those other 2 idiots?
I can only assumed they were redundancies.

393
00:43:19,258 --> 00:43:23,299
In case you didn't follow through.
One man to kill the Chancellor,

394
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,939
the other one to kill you.
A test.

395
00:43:25,964 --> 00:43:27,922
Second one I failed,
thanks to you.

396
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:31,359
And the car bomb was insurance.

397
00:43:35,203 --> 00:43:37,306
We have a tail.

398
00:43:38,614 --> 00:43:40,455
Who is he?

399
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,638
We're after the same thing,
and I can help you.

400
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:45,558
If you want to bring down the Syndicate,
you've to let me out.

401
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,589
They're closing.

402
00:43:48,471 --> 00:43:51,097
This has to look like an escape.
So, you just throw me out anywhere.

403
00:43:51,122 --> 00:43:53,582
Tell me who he is.

404
00:43:53,607 --> 00:43:54,915
Oh!

405
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:58,549
Oh. Change of plan.
Throw her out!

406
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:02,839
You have everything
you need to find me.

407
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:22,309
Less than 24 hours after we interviewed
Benji Dunn about Ethan Hunt

408
00:44:22,334 --> 00:44:24,862
He was on a plane to Vienna
with tickets to the opera.

409
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:28,163
And within 6 hours of his arrival,
the Chancellor was dead.

410
00:44:28,188 --> 00:44:30,632
Now, that might be circumstance
to some public defendant.

411
00:44:30,657 --> 00:44:33,783
But to the CIA,
that is actionable intelligence.

412
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:38,296
Consider the moment, the possibility that
Ethan's investigation lead him to the opera.

413
00:44:38,321 --> 00:44:39,993
And he's the one with
the actionable intelligence.

414
00:44:39,994 --> 00:44:44,140
In any case. Finding Hunt
is no longer our pet project.

415
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,436
The Special Activity Division
will now have full discretion.

416
00:44:49,075 --> 00:44:50,475
You mean shoot to kill?

417
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:55,158
Whether Hunt lives or dies.
It's entirely up to him.

418
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,097
New identity, passport,
cash, road map.

419
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,700
There's a change of clothes
in that bag, right there.

420
00:45:59,725 --> 00:46:02,582
Everything you need to
make it to DC undetected.

421
00:46:02,607 --> 00:46:05,367
Once you're there,
you'll have to inform on me.

422
00:46:05,392 --> 00:46:07,230
I'm suppose... what? Sorry, what?
- Tell the truth.

423
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,186
You came to Vienna believing
you won 2 tickets to the opera.

424
00:46:10,211 --> 00:46:13,567
And I attempted to recruit you into
assassinating the Chancellor, you refused.

425
00:46:13,592 --> 00:46:16,735
That is not the true.
- Your life depends on them believing you, Benji.

426
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,173
It'll go easier if you tell them
what they want to hear.

427
00:46:19,198 --> 00:46:22,838
Ethan, at least tell me
what this is all about.

428
00:46:30,977 --> 00:46:33,304
You recognized anyone?

429
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:48,871
Him.
- He's former KSA, German intelligence.

430
00:46:48,896 --> 00:46:51,055
Missing, presumed dead.

431
00:46:51,403 --> 00:46:53,351
He was at the opera tonight.

432
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:54,925
This one too.

433
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:58,392
Former Mossad.
- Let me guess. Presumed dead.

434
00:46:58,499 --> 00:47:00,957
Tonight, I made it official.

435
00:47:01,871 --> 00:47:04,252
I was looking for him
in Bosporus.

436
00:47:04,277 --> 00:47:08,314
The same day a car accident
killed the visiting President of Malawi.

437
00:47:08,986 --> 00:47:11,764
He slipped away again in Jakarta.

438
00:47:11,877 --> 00:47:14,909
Hours before a passenger plane
vanished over the Pacific

439
00:47:14,934 --> 00:47:17,722
with 236 passengers.

440
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:20,306
I just missed him
in the Philippines.

441
00:47:20,331 --> 00:47:25,430
Right before a fired petrochemical plant
gassed a village of 2.000 people.

442
00:47:27,205 --> 00:47:30,351
You're saying these accidents
are somehow connected.

443
00:47:31,247 --> 00:47:35,373
That missing plane was carrying
the Secretary of the World Bank.

444
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:39,896
That fire bank corrupted
a global arms cooperation.

445
00:47:40,504 --> 00:47:43,406
That wreck triggered a civil war.

446
00:47:44,746 --> 00:47:46,981
These are no accidents.

447
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:52,414
They're links in a chain. The work of
a single organization, the Syndicate.

448
00:47:52,554 --> 00:47:53,824
A rogue nation.

449
00:47:53,849 --> 00:47:56,955
Trained to do what we do.
Inbuilt with a new sense of purpose.

450
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,310
Destroy the system that created them.

451
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,892
Regardless if who's in the way.

452
00:48:02,386 --> 00:48:04,719
An anti-IMF.

453
00:48:04,744 --> 00:48:08,418
And since Hunley shut us down,
they've been escalating unchecked.

454
00:48:08,443 --> 00:48:11,144
Killing the Chancellor tonight
was a statement

455
00:48:11,168 --> 00:48:13,293
The start of a new phase.

456
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:17,696
Or they could just be
a series of random disasters.

457
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:20,895
He was there.

458
00:48:21,105 --> 00:48:22,256
Everytime.

459
00:48:22,281 --> 00:48:25,393
Just like he was there tonight.
I'm sure of it.

460
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:29,072
I don't know who he is,
where he's from.

461
00:48:29,249 --> 00:48:31,213
How he's funded

462
00:48:31,238 --> 00:48:33,351
But I know he's the key.

463
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:35,892
Ethan, this is what I sign up for.

464
00:48:35,917 --> 00:48:38,241
Let me help you find him.
- That's why I brought you here.

465
00:48:38,266 --> 00:48:40,684
In the first place.
And look what happened.

466
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,489
I can't protect you.

467
00:48:42,514 --> 00:48:44,471
That's why I need you to leave.

468
00:48:44,496 --> 00:48:47,728
It's not your decision
to make, Ethan.

469
00:48:47,753 --> 00:48:49,339
I'm a field agent.

470
00:48:49,364 --> 00:48:52,213
I know the risks.
More than that, I'm your friend.

471
00:48:52,238 --> 00:48:54,155
No matter what I... con
a polygraph every week.

472
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,238
Now you called me because
you needed my help.

473
00:48:57,263 --> 00:49:00,471
And you still do.
So, I'm staying.

474
00:49:00,497 --> 00:49:03,220
And that's all we're
gonna say about that.

475
00:49:07,164 --> 00:49:10,629
Okay
- Good

476
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,135
Where do we start?

477
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,143
Ilsa.

478
00:49:19,193 --> 00:49:21,838
Right.
And how do we find her?

479
00:49:21,863 --> 00:49:24,298
She said we've
everything we need.

480
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,930
We had an agreement.

481
00:50:05,955 --> 00:50:07,807
You send me to do
a job, I'd do it.

482
00:50:07,832 --> 00:50:10,786
But my way, not yours.
- When did I deviate?

483
00:50:10,811 --> 00:50:12,973
You put 2 more gunman
at the opera tonight.

484
00:50:12,998 --> 00:50:14,621
One of them try to kill me.

485
00:50:14,646 --> 00:50:15,765
You missed.

486
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:18,388
I missed because Ethan Hunt
was there looking for you.

487
00:50:18,413 --> 00:50:21,891
Ethan Hunt is in Vienna because
you allow him escape in London.

488
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:26,050
Vinter would've kill him in London
and that's not what you asked for.

489
00:50:26,075 --> 00:50:28,902
Twice now
you've let him slipped away.

490
00:50:30,217 --> 00:50:31,602
Curious.

491
00:50:31,627 --> 00:50:35,105
Are you questioning
my loyalty or my ability.

492
00:50:36,035 --> 00:50:38,244
Can't decide.
- I've told you before.

493
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:40,462
Trust me or kill me.

494
00:50:40,487 --> 00:50:43,472
But If you're going to kill me,
be the man.

495
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,768
Do it yourself.

496
00:51:14,344 --> 00:51:16,681
Did he say anything?

497
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:22,447
He knows about Morocco.
- What did he know about Morocco?

498
00:51:22,472 --> 00:51:26,838
He knows about the power plant.
He doesn't know what's in it.

499
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:30,330
Find him, please.

500
00:51:31,071 --> 00:51:32,961
He'll find me.

501
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:35,975
I've him seen to that.

502
00:51:40,622 --> 00:51:42,731
Well, that's interesting
- What is it?

503
00:51:42,756 --> 00:51:46,469
It's a SCIF. Secure Computer Facility
offline, ultra-contained.

504
00:51:46,494 --> 00:51:48,612
It's impossible to hack in
from the outside.

505
00:51:48,613 --> 00:51:51,158
It's essentially a digital
safety deposit box.

506
00:51:51,183 --> 00:51:54,851
Very strange thing for a young lady
to be carrying in her sundries.

507
00:51:54,876 --> 00:51:59,239
Where's it located?
- Morocco.

508
00:52:00,461 --> 00:52:02,316
Morocco.

509
00:52:03,845 --> 00:52:07,008
CASABLANCA
MOROCCO

510
00:53:17,593 --> 00:53:21,361
Now, what brings you
gentlemen to Casablanca?

511
00:53:50,908 --> 00:53:55,091
Good to see you
- What couldn't you tell me over the telephone?

512
00:53:56,261 --> 00:53:59,182
The Chancellor of Austria
was assassinated.

513
00:53:59,207 --> 00:54:02,095
We believe that Ethan
and Benji were there.

514
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,741
Huntley's handed this over
to Special Activities Division.

515
00:54:06,145 --> 00:54:09,281
We need to find Ethan
before they do.

516
00:54:09,748 --> 00:54:12,050
That's where you come in.

517
00:54:13,507 --> 00:54:16,503
Not interested.
- Okay. Look, Luther.

518
00:54:16,528 --> 00:54:20,781
Look, man. I know Ethan.
I don't know you.

519
00:54:21,095 --> 00:54:24,083
All I know about you is that
you chose to work for Hunley.

520
00:54:24,109 --> 00:54:27,738
Yeah, all I know about you
is you chose to resign.

521
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:30,485
You don't have to
worry about Ethan.

522
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:33,566
They'll never catch him
- No, they're not going to catch him. No.

523
00:54:33,591 --> 00:54:35,963
This is the CIA, this is Hunley
we're talking about.

524
00:54:35,988 --> 00:54:39,473
Thing are out of control
And they're going to kill him.

525
00:54:39,968 --> 00:54:43,324
They're going to kill Ethan.
They're going to kill Benji.

526
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:47,177
We have to get to them first.
Are you going to help me?

527
00:54:53,621 --> 00:54:56,324
You need to understand something.

528
00:54:57,104 --> 00:54:59,646
Ethan is my friend

529
00:54:59,981 --> 00:55:04,049
And if I have 1 second of doubt
whose side you're on.

530
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:08,910
I believe you

531
00:55:09,856 --> 00:55:11,882
Alright.
- Alright.

532
00:55:11,907 --> 00:55:15,333
What do I have to go on?
- Not much.

533
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:17,540
And not a lot of time.

534
00:55:19,006 --> 00:55:23,772
His name is Solomon Lane.
He created the Syndicate.

535
00:55:23,797 --> 00:55:25,790
Where does he come from?

536
00:55:26,265 --> 00:55:29,052
He's former British intelligence.

537
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,858
Well. If British intelligence
knows the Syndicate exist,

538
00:55:31,883 --> 00:55:34,068
why don't they
just tell the CIA?

539
00:55:34,093 --> 00:55:39,339
Because they don't want anyone knowing
the Syndicate was created by one of their own.

540
00:55:39,658 --> 00:55:42,491
I was sent undercover
to earn Lane's trust.

541
00:55:42,516 --> 00:55:45,771
And eventually identifying
the members of his organization.

542
00:55:45,796 --> 00:55:48,306
For the first time in 2 years,

543
00:55:48,331 --> 00:55:50,794
I'm close to knowing
who they are.

544
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:55,366
Lane had a ledger. It contain
the identities of his operatives,

545
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:59,352
his terrorist associates, the entire
inner workings of the Syndicate.

546
00:55:59,377 --> 00:56:02,561
One of his agents stole it
hoping to blackmail him.

547
00:56:02,586 --> 00:56:06,695
He kept it in a secure computer
facility for safe keeping.

548
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,500
He died being interrogated
for the access code.

549
00:56:09,525 --> 00:56:10,801
Leaving Lane with a serious problem.

550
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:14,808
So the key to crushing Lane 

551
00:56:15,444 --> 00:56:18,162
is sitting in a computer just waiting
for someone to take it?

552
00:56:19,298 --> 00:56:22,427
So why hasn't Lane just
send someone to steal it?

553
00:56:23,152 --> 00:56:27,208
Oh, he has.
He sent me.

554
00:56:27,731 --> 00:56:29,409
And I can tell you.

555
00:56:30,508 --> 00:56:32,185
It's impossible.

556
00:56:35,943 --> 00:56:39,714
The facility is hidden beneath the
local power plant under military guard.

557
00:56:39,749 --> 00:56:41,440
And the only way
to download the ledger 

558
00:56:41,888 --> 00:56:44,231
is through the central computer
terminal located there.

559
00:56:45,743 --> 00:56:48,518
To reach the terminal,
you'll need to pass the main gates.

560
00:56:49,769 --> 00:56:52,308
Access the elevator
with fingerprint recognition

561
00:56:53,782 --> 00:56:56,357
And open 3 separate combination locks.

562
00:57:02,212 --> 00:57:05,709
Well, that's easy. We just impersonate the
agent who stole the ledger in the first place.

563
00:57:05,744 --> 00:57:07,180
And I get to wear a mask.

564
00:57:30,244 --> 00:57:34,426
Unfortunately, even if you can make
it through every other security measure

565
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,854
you won't beat the last one.

566
00:57:36,397 --> 00:57:38,628
That's because it's protected
by gait analysis.

567
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,485
A step beyond facial recognition.

568
00:57:40,539 --> 00:57:43,308
These cameras actually know
how the agent walks,

569
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:47,055
how he talks, how he moves,
right down to his facial takes.

570
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,929
So, what you're saying is,
no mask can beat it.

571
00:57:56,954 --> 00:57:58,399
We're busted before we could
even get into the vault.

572
00:57:58,424 --> 00:58:00,124
And I wind up in a Morocco jail 

573
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,956
playing mommies and daddies
without a mother strangler.

574
00:58:02,542 --> 00:58:04,316
Okay, I don't get
to wear a mask.

575
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:07,610
And there's no other way into the computer lab?
- No other way in.

576
00:58:07,622 --> 00:58:10,114
Air Shaft?
- 6 inch diameter pipe.

577
00:58:10,149 --> 00:58:12,780
Foundation?
- 12 feet of concrete, top and bottom.

578
00:58:13,648 --> 00:58:15,326
Electrical conduit?
- Bottom line is,

579
00:58:15,351 --> 00:58:17,019
there's no way into
that terminal unless

580
00:58:17,044 --> 00:58:20,292
your profile is pre-installed
in the security system.

581
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:22,909
Profile?

582
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:25,471
Where're the profile stored?

583
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:29,502
All security data is stored
offline in the liquid cooler aid.

584
00:58:29,685 --> 00:58:32,750
Here, inside the torus,
liquid cooled.

585
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:34,772
You mean that thing
is under water?

586
00:58:34,807 --> 00:58:36,364
Yes.
- Yes.

587
00:58:36,878 --> 00:58:37,958
Okay.

588
00:58:37,983 --> 00:58:41,500
So, to get the ledger, one of us
needs to enter the torus

589
00:58:42,595 --> 00:58:44,853
and change the security profile.

590
00:58:46,585 --> 00:58:49,901
So that the other one can access
the computer without being caught.

591
00:58:51,853 --> 00:58:54,997
That's the only way.
- That's the only way.

592
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,996
Can I get in through there.

593
00:58:58,021 --> 00:59:00,340
What's that?
- That's the service hatch.

594
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:02,156
It can only be opened
from the inside.

595
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:04,134
If you try and open it
from the outside,

596
00:59:04,169 --> 00:59:07,420
you'll be hit with 70 thousand
gallons of pressurized water.

597
00:59:07,455 --> 00:59:08,395
Where does the water
come from?

598
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,747
Desalinized seawater
flows through the intake.

599
00:59:10,782 --> 00:59:12,884
in the pipeline.
And before you ask,

600
00:59:12,909 --> 00:59:15,707
the system is designed to shut down
automatically if any metal 

601
00:59:16,522 --> 00:59:17,595
enters the intake.

602
00:59:18,276 --> 00:59:19,779
No oxygen tanks.

603
00:59:22,103 --> 00:59:24,918
Alright. Well, how long 
will it take to free swim

604
00:59:25,435 --> 00:59:26,683
from the intake
to the service hatch.

605
00:59:26,718 --> 00:59:28,974
2 minutes.
With the current at full power.

606
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:31,404
Well. Then, you just have to hold
your breath for 2 minutes.

607
00:59:31,515 --> 00:59:35,397
What about installing the security profile?
- Well. That's gonna be like a minute tops.

608
00:59:35,412 --> 00:59:37,396
So, I have to hold my breath
for 3 minutes?

609
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:38,713
You can do that.

610
00:59:38,748 --> 00:59:40,977
But I think you're overlooking,
is the physical exertion.

611
00:59:41,012 --> 00:59:44,118
The more you exert yourself,
the faster you consume oxygen.

612
00:59:44,153 --> 00:59:45,910
Don't worry about him.
Alright.

613
00:59:45,945 --> 00:59:49,412
All he has to do is install the fake profile
before I get to the gait analysis.

614
00:59:49,447 --> 00:59:50,910
You said it yourself,
it's the only way

615
00:59:51,644 --> 00:59:53,047
That doesn't sound impossible.

616
00:59:57,331 --> 01:00:00,098
Satellite over-watch
covering all 7 continents,

617
01:00:00,123 --> 01:00:04,470
DNA profiling, facial recognition,
drone surveillance, drone strikes.

618
01:00:04,505 --> 01:00:07,262
So, how are we suppose to find
Ethan and Benji before they do?

619
01:00:07,297 --> 01:00:10,182
I'm not even looking for them.
I'm looking for her.

620
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:12,327
What do you mean?

621
01:00:13,379 --> 01:00:16,166
These sketches,
what do you see?

622
01:00:18,184 --> 01:00:21,238
Ethan's not exactly sure
who this guys is.

623
01:00:22,829 --> 01:00:26,264
But this woman,
he knows her.

624
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:27,799
He trust her.

625
01:00:28,276 --> 01:00:31,173
I'm betting that if he's not
already with her, he's on his way.

626
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:32,455
Find her, find Ethan.

627
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,927
Tell me it's possible to pull
facial recognition of a sketch.

628
01:00:34,952 --> 01:00:36,433
For mere mortals, no.

629
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:39,051
For me, I could've done this
at home.

630
01:00:39,063 --> 01:00:40,285
Alright.

631
01:00:44,768 --> 01:00:47,485
How long is this going to take?
- Found her.

632
01:00:49,886 --> 01:00:53,860
CCTV picked her up
at the airport in Casablanca.

633
01:00:54,334 --> 01:00:54,974
<font color="#ff8080">DISAVOWED</font>

634
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:56,485
<font color="#ff8080">DISAVOWED</font>
- What the hell?

635
01:00:57,911 --> 01:00:59,478
She's bad news.

636
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:24,284
Card.
- Hello.

637
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:29,942
Sorry.

638
01:02:00,212 --> 01:02:02,902
Your card is not working.
- Benji, we're in.

639
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,330
<font color="#b0ffb0">Released</font>

640
01:02:07,604 --> 01:02:09,419
Thank you.

641
01:02:46,707 --> 01:02:49,878
One more time.
You have 3 minutes.

642
01:02:49,903 --> 01:02:53,037
2.5 minutes to switch
the security profile.

643
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:56,176
30 seconds to escape
through the service hatch.

644
01:02:56,201 --> 01:02:58,039
Remember, conserve oxygen.

645
01:02:58,430 --> 01:02:59,983
Don't move a muscle
if you don't have to.

646
01:03:18,347 --> 01:03:20,038
I'm in the elevator.

647
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:33,900
That current will
carry you to a torus.

648
01:03:33,925 --> 01:03:35,751
Once you're there,
I'll shut it down.

649
01:03:36,405 --> 01:03:40,046
Important note.
The profile is in slot 108.

650
01:03:40,244 --> 01:03:42,319
And a slightly more
important note,

651
01:03:42,354 --> 01:03:45,408
if you haven't switched that profile
before I reach the gait analysis,

652
01:03:45,443 --> 01:03:46,383
I'm dead.

653
01:03:46,624 --> 01:03:47,735
Thank you, Benji.

654
01:04:57,506 --> 01:05:01,119
What's the problem?
- The cooling system is rebooting...

655
01:05:01,144 --> 01:05:02,807
by itself.

656
01:06:12,255 --> 01:06:13,640
Oaf.

657
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:28,593
All systems' normal.

658
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:30,829
Clearing systems at full power.

659
01:06:35,306 --> 01:06:37,149
SERVICE HATCH
<font color="#ff8080">SECURE </font>

660
01:06:37,174 --> 01:06:40,220
No, no, no, no, no, no...

661
01:08:11,078 --> 01:08:12,300
<font color="#b0ffb0">AUTHORISED</font>

662
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:09,312
You're alright.
You're okay.

663
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:11,891
See.
What did I told you.

664
01:10:11,892 --> 01:10:15,488
Difficult, absolutely,
but certainly not impossible...

665
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:19,166
Jesus, is he alright?
What happened? What happened?

666
01:10:31,753 --> 01:10:32,876
Okay.
Okay.

667
01:10:34,546 --> 01:10:36,030
Here.

668
01:10:37,362 --> 01:10:38,846
Hey.

669
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:41,075
I misjudged you.

670
01:10:46,203 --> 01:10:48,715
Hey, man. Hey.
You okay? How're you doing?

671
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,302
Hey, buddy.

672
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:53,276
Benji.
- Yes, it's Benji.

673
01:10:53,301 --> 01:10:54,868
You did good.

674
01:10:54,869 --> 01:10:56,873
You take a moment, alright.
Just-Just take a moment.

675
01:10:56,898 --> 01:10:59,321
There's nothing a little sunshine
and fresh air won't fix you.

676
01:10:59,346 --> 01:11:01,209
You'll be as right as rain.
- What are you doing here?

677
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:03,443
Look-look-look...

678
01:11:04,345 --> 01:11:05,163
We got it.

679
01:11:05,882 --> 01:11:07,883
I knew we'll get it.

680
01:11:09,475 --> 01:11:11,134
Listen. I don't want to
sound ungrateful, okay.

681
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:13,101
I appreciate everything
you do for me, but...

682
01:11:13,126 --> 01:11:15,220
one of these days,
you're gonna take it too far.

683
01:11:17,365 --> 01:11:18,612
We got it.

684
01:11:19,314 --> 01:11:20,646
We're gonna nail that...

685
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:33,048
Wait.
Wait.

686
01:11:35,392 --> 01:11:36,841
I thought you said
you can find him?

687
01:11:36,866 --> 01:11:39,871
I said I could locate him.
You've to find him.

688
01:11:39,896 --> 01:11:41,389
Right.

689
01:11:41,414 --> 01:11:43,554
<font color="#ff8080">SEARCHING
SEARCHING</font>

690
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:01,611
Where's Hunt?

691
01:12:07,558 --> 01:12:08,981
He's dead.

692
01:12:09,006 --> 01:12:10,328
Oh.
That really hurts!

693
01:12:10,353 --> 01:12:11,779
Can you walk?
- Yes, I can.

694
01:12:11,804 --> 01:12:15,384
We have to get to her
before Lane does.

695
01:13:04,035 --> 01:13:06,633
Whoa-whoa-whoa...
Are you okay to drive?

696
01:13:06,658 --> 01:13:08,942
I mean. A minute ago
you were dead.

697
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:11,135
What are you talking about?

698
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,622
This is not gonna end well.

699
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,338
There she is.

700
01:13:35,437 --> 01:13:37,942
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

701
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:40,450
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

702
01:13:41,602 --> 01:13:44,337
Ah!
God damn it.

703
01:14:14,389 --> 01:14:16,084
Whoa.

704
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:26,000
Hey?

705
01:14:27,815 --> 01:14:29,508
I found them.

706
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:32,629
Come on, man.

707
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,837
Shit.

708
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,881
It's a high-speed chase.

709
01:14:38,906 --> 01:14:41,189
You just had to get
the 4 by 4, didn't you?

710
01:14:41,214 --> 01:14:42,899
Hey, look. Don't blame me.
You chose the car.

711
01:14:42,924 --> 01:14:44,810
You just had to have it!
- Do you want me to drive?

712
01:14:44,835 --> 01:14:46,200
Do you want me to drive?
- Look, it's a stick.

713
01:14:46,225 --> 01:14:49,253
Look at this. Look how slow
you're going. Speed it up.

714
01:14:53,597 --> 01:14:55,598
Who's this guy?

715
01:14:57,070 --> 01:14:59,071
Shit!

716
01:15:17,465 --> 01:15:19,722
AWW!

717
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,586
Go-go-go-
Go!

718
01:15:30,042 --> 01:15:32,846
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I'm okay.

719
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:38,493
Ho!

720
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:41,501
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

721
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:50,712
Here they come!

722
01:15:50,737 --> 01:15:52,741
What're we gonna do?

723
01:16:05,268 --> 01:16:07,106
Gun!

724
01:16:09,722 --> 01:16:11,273
Do you have
your seat belts on?

725
01:16:11,298 --> 01:16:13,467
What?
You're asking me that now?

726
01:16:21,022 --> 01:16:23,215
Hang on!
- Ah!

727
01:16:23,778 --> 01:16:25,377
Aww!

728
01:17:02,036 --> 01:17:03,822
Are you good?

729
01:17:03,847 --> 01:17:06,248
Things...
got a little out of hand.

730
01:17:06,273 --> 01:17:08,674
Aw!
Look out!

731
01:17:13,008 --> 01:17:15,981
Okay.
We're good?

732
01:17:24,202 --> 01:17:26,602
Oh, hi boys.
What did I miss?

733
01:17:31,515 --> 01:17:34,506
Woo. That look sharp.
Careful, careful.

734
01:21:16,391 --> 01:21:18,744
So, what do we do now?

735
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:24,464
Please tell me, you made
a copy of that disk...

736
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:28,800
Of course I made a copy.

737
01:21:36,185 --> 01:21:38,187
So where are we going?

738
01:22:02,132 --> 01:22:03,335
It's a ledger.

739
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,553
The Syndicate's entire infrastructure.

740
01:22:05,578 --> 01:22:07,030
Who they are, the politicians
they control,

741
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:08,347
and where the money comes from.

742
01:22:09,397 --> 01:22:10,321
It's everything
you want to know.

743
01:22:11,586 --> 01:22:14,958
What makes you think this
so-called ledger is authentic?

744
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:18,066
Why would Lane want it so badly
if it wasn't authentic?

745
01:22:18,091 --> 01:22:20,619
Why would he ever
let you have it if it was?

746
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:23,946
Did you never stop to consider
he may want me to have it?

747
01:22:23,971 --> 01:22:25,514
Misinformation, manipulation.

748
01:22:25,539 --> 01:22:27,932
What he does exercise,
what he's trained to do.

749
01:22:28,187 --> 01:22:30,506
Lane lies to you,
you sell his lies to Hunt.

750
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:33,162
Together, you both are compromised.

751
01:22:33,187 --> 01:22:34,714
That's his ultimate objective.

752
01:22:35,597 --> 01:22:36,964
This may be authentic.

753
01:22:37,501 --> 01:22:41,468
But there's only one person I trust
to verify that information. You.

754
01:22:44,233 --> 01:22:45,371
No.

755
01:22:47,009 --> 01:22:49,774
My orders were to deliver you
information regarding the Syndicate.

756
01:22:49,799 --> 01:22:51,501
Your orders were
to infiltrate the Syndicate

757
01:22:51,789 --> 01:22:54,709
that we may learn
more about them first hand.

758
01:22:55,082 --> 01:22:57,107
This isn't prove, it's a test,
like everything else.

759
01:22:57,377 --> 01:22:59,544
The only way to pass,
is to go back.

760
01:22:59,934 --> 01:23:01,374
I can't do that.

761
01:23:01,413 --> 01:23:04,120
I betrayed Lane's trust
too many times.

762
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:06,455
And in every instance, you
did so on you own volition.

763
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,218
He was going to tortured
and killed an American agent.

764
01:23:09,243 --> 01:23:12,734
And you should've let him, and
you would still have Lane's trust.

765
01:23:12,759 --> 01:23:14,861
This is the trade,
Hunt understands that.

766
01:23:14,886 --> 01:23:17,427
I wasn't going to let him die.
He is our ally.

767
01:23:17,452 --> 01:23:22,007
There are no allies in state craft,
Ilsa. Only common interest.

768
01:23:22,032 --> 01:23:25,728
As it stands, Ethan Hunt
is a man without a country.

769
01:23:25,753 --> 01:23:30,463
This makes killing him
decidedly less complicated.

770
01:23:31,626 --> 01:23:33,484
Are you ordering
me to kill Hunt?

771
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:36,518
Good god, no.
Nothing so crude as that, no.

772
01:23:37,228 --> 01:23:39,402
Lane will order you.

773
01:23:39,427 --> 01:23:43,583
And to regain his trust,
you will do it.

774
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:47,519
You sent me
to do a job.

775
01:23:48,298 --> 01:23:49,407
I did it.

776
01:23:50,347 --> 01:23:52,052
Now, you bring me in.

777
01:23:52,404 --> 01:23:55,340
Might I remind you, you're
without a country of your own.

778
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,910
The director of the CIA called me
inquiring about you personally.

779
01:23:59,935 --> 01:24:02,259
Of course to protect your cover,
I had to lie.

780
01:24:02,515 --> 01:24:03,993
So, as far as the
Americans are concern,

781
01:24:04,018 --> 01:24:06,867
you're a rogue assassin,
a target of opportunity.

782
01:24:08,045 --> 01:24:11,347
A precious few people
know about your true identity.

783
01:24:11,372 --> 01:24:15,657
It would be unfortunate
if we forgot.

784
01:24:17,055 --> 01:24:19,594
You see, there really
is no choice, Ilsa.

785
01:24:20,105 --> 01:24:21,384
You're going back.

786
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:31,640
Glad to know
you're still with us.

787
01:24:40,694 --> 01:24:41,974
What?
What's happening?

788
01:24:41,975 --> 01:24:43,433
I can't open it.

789
01:24:43,434 --> 01:24:44,652
What do you mean
you can't open it?

790
01:24:44,677 --> 01:24:46,923
I mean
I can't open it, ever.

791
01:24:46,948 --> 01:24:48,737
That's a red box.

792
01:24:48,761 --> 01:24:50,628
A what?
- It's a red box.

793
01:24:50,653 --> 01:24:53,577
The British government uses it
to transport national secrets.

794
01:24:53,602 --> 01:24:54,651
Doesn't sound good.

795
01:24:54,676 --> 01:24:57,174
Meaning it's triple encrypted.
You don't get into that thing

796
01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:02,656
