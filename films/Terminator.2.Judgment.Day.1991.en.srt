1
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,507
<i>Three billion human lives ended
on August 29, 1997.</i>

2
00:01:24,446 --> 00:01:26,574
<i>The survivors of the nuclear fire...</i>

3
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:29,452
<i>called the war "Judgment Day."</i>

4
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:32,580
<i>They lived only to face
a new nightmare:</i>

5
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:34,706
<i>The war against the machines.</i>

6
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:56,623
<i>The computer which controlled
the machines, Skynet,</i>

7
00:02:56,748 --> 00:02:59,709
<i>sent two Terminator
back through time.</i>

8
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:03,922
<i>Their mission: To destroy the leader
of the human resistance...</i>

9
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:06,473
<i>John Connor, my son.</i>

10
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,098
<i>The first Terminator
was programmed to strike at me...</i>

11
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:15,100
<i>in the year 1984,</i>

12
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:17,435
<i>before John was born.</i>

13
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,437
<i>It failed.</i>

14
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:22,274
<i>The second was set
to strike at John himself...</i>

15
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:24,400
<i>when he was still a child.</i>

16
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:32,367
<i>As before, the resistance was able
to send a lone warrior,</i>

17
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:34,786
<i>a protector for John.</i>

18
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:38,414
<i>It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.</i>

19
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:56,215
I need your clothes, your boots
and your motorcycle.

20
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:07,101
You forgot to say "please."

21
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,994
Get him off me!

22
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,932
Pull it out!

23
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:48,670
Pull it out!
Oh, pull it out!

24
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:09,321
Take it.

25
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:38,151
Can't let you take
the man's wheels, son.

26
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:41,431
Now, get off
before I put you down.

27
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:57,983
R-31 David, Sherman Code Six
at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe...

28
00:10:58,108 --> 00:11:01,112
on an electrical disturbance.

29
00:11:01,237 --> 00:11:03,488
Ten-four, R-31 David.

30
00:12:31,703 --> 00:12:34,997
Come on.
Let's go to my house.

31
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:42,463
John? John, get in there and
clean up that pigsty of yours.

32
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:49,325
John!

33
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,185
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

34
00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:00,482
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

35
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:03,194
He won't even answer me anymore.
Honey, move.

36
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:06,238
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

37
00:13:06,364 --> 00:13:09,200
Todd!
What? What?

38
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:12,579
He hasn't cleaned
that room of his in a month.

39
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:16,206
Well, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

40
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:23,504
Come on!

41
00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:28,597
John! Come on. Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells ya.

42
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:32,891
She's not my mother, Todd.

43
00:13:59,127 --> 00:14:01,087
This next patient is interesting.

44
00:14:01,212 --> 00:14:03,505
I've been following
the case for years.

45
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:05,800
A 29-year-old female diag...

46
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:07,886
Hey, hey! Come on.

47
00:14:08,011 --> 00:14:10,555
Diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

48
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,892
Depression,
anxiety, violent acting out,

49
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:15,976
delusions of pebecution.

50
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:25,695
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

51
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,490
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator,

52
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:33,035
which looks human ofcourse,
was sent back through time to kill her.

53
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:37,332
That's original. And also
that the father of her child...

54
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:40,208
was a soldier sent back
to protect her.

55
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:42,712
No.
He was from the future too.

56
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:47,157
The year... 2029,
if I remember correctly.

57
00:14:47,592 --> 00:14:49,527
And here we are.

58
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,551
Morning, Sarah.

59
00:14:56,098 --> 00:14:59,851
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

60
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:03,397
Fine, Sarah.

61
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:07,238
She... stabbed me
in the kneecap...

62
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:10,324
with my pen a few weeks ago.

63
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:12,197
Repeated escape attempts.

64
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,522
Let's move on, shall we?

65
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:28,257
Douglas, I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

66
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:31,758
See that she takes her Thorazine. Sure,
Dr. Silberman. I'll take care of it.

67
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:47,444
Time to take your meds, Connor.

68
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:49,157
You take it.

69
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:52,825
Now, you know you gotta be good 'cause
you're up for review this afternoon.

70
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,411
I'm not taking it, Dougie.
I don't want any trouble.

71
00:15:56,537 --> 00:15:58,145
Ain't no trouble.

72
00:16:04,253 --> 00:16:05,732
Yeah, zap her.

73
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:17,788
Last call, sugar.

74
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:25,773
Sweet dreams.

75
00:16:55,468 --> 00:16:57,509
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

76
00:16:57,931 --> 00:17:01,267
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

77
00:17:01,393 --> 00:17:04,355
Could I speak with him, please?
You could if he were here.

78
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,316
He took offon his bike this morning,
so he could be anywhere.

79
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:09,652
Do you have a photograph ofJohn?

80
00:17:09,777 --> 00:17:12,153
Yeah. Sure. Hold on.

81
00:17:13,572 --> 00:17:16,033
You gonna tell me
what this is about?

82
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:18,619
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

83
00:17:20,076 --> 00:17:23,663
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

84
00:17:23,947 --> 00:17:27,295
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him too.

85
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,839
Yeah, a big guy on a bike. Has
that got something to do with this?

86
00:17:33,643 --> 00:17:36,887
No. I wouldn't worry about him.

87
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:41,134
Thanks for your cooperation.

88
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:45,407
Please insert your stolen card now.

89
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:54,822
PIN number.

90
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:57,340
Will you hurry up?
This is taking too long.

91
00:17:57,364 --> 00:17:58,781
Go, baby.
Go, baby.

92
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:04,206
All right.
PIN number 9003.

93
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:06,584
Where'd you learn this
stuff from anyway? From my mom.

94
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:08,390
My real mom, I mean...

95
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:12,539
Withdraw: 300 bucks.

96
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:15,381
Come on, baby. Come on!
Come on. Come on!

97
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:17,568
Yes!
Hey, it worked.

98
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:21,486
All right. Easy money.
Come on!

99
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:26,144
- Yes! Piece of cake.
- Yeah!

100
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:34,113
- Is that her?
- Yes.

101
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,448
So she's pretty cool?

102
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,783
No, she's a complete psycho.

103
00:18:38,908 --> 00:18:43,413
That's why she's up at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute. Okay?

104
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:46,907
She tried to blow up a computer factory,
but she got shot and arrested.

105
00:18:47,032 --> 00:18:48,304
No shit.

106
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:51,231
She's a total loser.

107
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:54,378
Come on. Let's go spend
some money. All right.

108
00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:21,762
Sarah.

109
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:24,997
Sarah. Wake up.

110
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:33,743
Kyle.

111
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:40,341
You're dead.
Where's our son, Sarah?

112
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:43,636
They took him away from me.

113
00:19:43,804 --> 00:19:46,500
- He's the target now.
- I know.

114
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,059
He's all alone.
You have to protect him.

115
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:50,385
I know.

116
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,081
You tell me how
I'm supposed to do that.

117
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:56,483
He doesn't even
believe me anymore.

118
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:58,574
I've lost him.

119
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:02,299
You're strong, Sarah. Stronger
than you ever thought you could be.

120
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:03,424
No.

121
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:05,576
On your feet, soldier.

122
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,166
I love you, Sarah.

123
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,653
I always will.

124
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:13,876
I need you.

125
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:15,669
I'll always be with you.

126
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,844
Remember the message.

127
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:24,970
The future is not set.

128
00:20:26,283 --> 00:20:29,686
There is no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

129
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:51,503
Stay with me.

130
00:20:52,264 --> 00:20:55,305
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

131
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,762
Kyle, don't go!

132
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,315
Kyle!

133
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,807
Mommy, watch this!
Watch this, Mommy!

134
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:33,929
<i>It's like a giant strobe light...</i>

135
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:37,189
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

136
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,278
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

137
00:22:49,263 --> 00:22:51,245
<i>Oh, God.</i>

138
00:22:54,647 --> 00:22:57,841
<i>We know the dream's the same
every night.</i>

139
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,798
<i>- Why do I have to...
- Please continue.</i>

140
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:08,512
<i>Children look like burnt paper.</i>

141
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:10,681
<i>Black.</i>

142
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,809
<i>Not moving.</i>

143
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:18,557
<i>And then the blast wave hits them.</i>

144
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:29,985
<i>And they fly apart like leaves.</i>

145
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:35,783
<i>Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world, are very common.</i>

146
00:23:38,787 --> 00:23:41,830
<i>It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.</i>

147
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:46,920
<i>I know the date it happens.
I'm sure it feels very real to you.</i>

148
00:23:47,045 --> 00:23:49,506
<i>On August 29, 1997,</i>

149
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:53,093
<i>it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you too!</i>

150
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,128
<i>Anybody not wearing two million sunblock
is gonna have a real bad day. Get it?</i>

151
00:23:59,015 --> 00:24:01,810
<i>God, you think
you're safe and alive.</i>

152
00:24:01,935 --> 00:24:04,187
<i>You're already dead.
Everybody!</i>

153
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:06,773
<i>Him. You. You're dead already.</i>

154
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:09,567
<i>This whole place,
everything you see is gone!</i>

155
00:24:09,692 --> 00:24:11,906
<i>You're the one living
in a fucking dream, Silberman,</i>

156
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:13,950
<i>'cause I know it happens!</i>

157
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:16,120
<i>It happens!</i>

158
00:24:26,963 --> 00:24:29,799
I feel much better now.

159
00:24:29,924 --> 00:24:31,801
Clearer.

160
00:24:31,926 --> 00:24:34,804
Yes, your attitude has been...

161
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:37,264
much improved lately.

162
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:48,910
It's helped me to have a goal,

163
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:52,041
something to look forward to.

164
00:24:52,317 --> 00:24:53,532
What is that?

165
00:24:54,253 --> 00:24:55,910
Well, you said...

166
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:59,830
that if I showed improvement
after six months,

167
00:24:59,955 --> 00:25:02,500
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing...

168
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:05,210
and I could have visitors.

169
00:25:07,226 --> 00:25:09,590
Well, it's been six months,

170
00:25:09,715 --> 00:25:10,715
and...

171
00:25:12,134 --> 00:25:14,588
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

172
00:25:15,603 --> 00:25:16,709
I see.

173
00:25:20,517 --> 00:25:24,996
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

174
00:25:25,606 --> 00:25:28,034
Now you think they don't exist?

175
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:32,597
They don't exist.
I know that now.

176
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:36,367
But you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one...

177
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:38,493
in a hydraulic press.

178
00:25:39,787 --> 00:25:43,040
If I had, there would have
been some evidence.

179
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:45,626
They would have found
something at the factory.

180
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:47,429
I see.

181
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:51,507
<i>So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?</i>

182
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:56,394
<i>No. Why would they?</i>

183
00:25:57,414 --> 00:26:00,082
Let's try a new position
right there.

184
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:07,438
Those neurons are all saturated.

185
00:26:09,817 --> 00:26:13,112
Mr. Dyson? Mr. Dyson.

186
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:15,572
The materials team
is running another-

187
00:26:15,698 --> 00:26:17,575
- Mr. Dyson.
- Yes?

188
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,578
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

189
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:23,454
You have to sign for the...
the, uh... it.

190
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:26,958
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. Come on. I'll get it.

191
00:26:27,232 --> 00:26:29,044
Listen, Mr. Dyson.

192
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:32,369
I know I haven't been here that long,
but I was wondering if you could tell me...

193
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:34,118
- I mean, if you know...
- Know what?

194
00:26:34,243 --> 00:26:36,761
Well, if you know
where "it" came from.

195
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:40,222
You know, I asked them that very same
question once. You know what they told me?

196
00:26:40,347 --> 00:26:42,348
"Don't ask."

197
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,107
Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
How's it going?

198
00:26:50,232 --> 00:26:55,154
Okay. Insert key.
Left on three, two, one.

199
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:56,700
Turn.

200
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:02,741
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

201
00:27:30,762 --> 00:27:33,029
So what do you think, Doctor?

202
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:37,043
I have shown improvement,
haven't I?

203
00:27:37,418 --> 00:27:40,240
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

204
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,620
I know how smart you are,

205
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,623
and I think you're just telling me
what I want to hear.

206
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,835
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

207
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,797
I think if I put you in minimum
security, you'll just try to escape again.

208
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,928
You have to let me see my son.

209
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,454
Please.

210
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,440
Please.

211
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,773
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

212
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,859
If I could just make a phone call...

213
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:16,485
I'm afraid not.
Not for a while.

214
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,032
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board...

215
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,701
that you stay here
for another six months.

216
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:30,166
- I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
- Now, calm down...

217
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,337
- Douglas! Douglas!
- You son of a bitch!

218
00:28:33,506 --> 00:28:36,672
Get her off!
Ten c.c.'s ofsodium amobarbital, stat!

219
00:28:37,786 --> 00:28:40,134
You don't know what you're doing!

220
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:42,410
Get some restraints in here now!

221
00:28:43,945 --> 00:28:47,100
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Got her?

222
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,469
God!

223
00:28:51,032 --> 00:28:53,050
Model citizen.

224
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:35,023
You just missed him.
He was here, like, 15 minutes ago.

225
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:38,235
I think he said he was going
to the galleria, right? Yeah.

226
00:29:38,696 --> 00:29:40,070
The galleria?

227
00:30:17,101 --> 00:30:20,212
- I've never seen him.
- Yeah. He's in the arcade.

228
00:30:25,152 --> 00:30:28,495
Hey, bro, I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right? Cool.

229
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:46,095
Oh, no! Girls, do you know John Connor?

230
00:30:46,336 --> 00:30:47,336
No.

231
00:30:50,606 --> 00:30:52,787
Do you know this guy?

232
00:30:52,912 --> 00:30:54,936
Nah, I don't know him.

233
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:02,111
- John.
- Not now. Not now.

234
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:05,841
Hey. Man, there's this cop
scoping for you. Check it out.

235
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,537
- Yeah. He's right over there.
- Split, man. Just go.

236
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:12,662
Yeah.

237
00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:20,255
Hey, man, I think I saw that kid
you were looking...

238
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,311
Hey! You're not supposed
to be in here!

239
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:03,133
Get down.

240
00:33:13,162 --> 00:33:16,161
Hey, mister, are you all right?

241
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:18,541
Mister, you all right?

242
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:34,724
Come on!

243
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:45,302
Come on!

244
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,710
Shit.

245
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:16,483
Damn!

246
00:38:55,587 --> 00:38:58,173
Okay, time-out.
Stop the bike.

247
00:38:58,298 --> 00:39:00,716
Time-out.
Come on. Stop the bike.

248
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:18,109
Holy shit. Now, don't take this the wrong
way, but you are a Terminator, right?

249
00:39:18,372 --> 00:39:21,800
Yes. Cyberdyne Systems,
Model 101.

250
00:39:22,155 --> 00:39:23,155
No.

251
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:34,864
Holy shit.

252
00:39:37,264 --> 00:39:39,006
You're really real.

253
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,343
I mean...

254
00:39:44,113 --> 00:39:46,722
You're like a machine
underneath, right,

255
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:48,766
but sort of alive outside?

256
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:53,397
I'm a cybernetic organism.
Living tissue over metal endoskeleton.

257
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:10,580
This is intense.

258
00:40:10,705 --> 00:40:13,874
Get a grip, John. Okay.

259
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:18,087
You're not here to kill me.

260
00:40:18,212 --> 00:40:20,630
I figured that part out for myself.

261
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:24,969
So what's the deal?
My mission is to protect you.

262
00:40:25,371 --> 00:40:27,680
Yeah? Who sent you?

263
00:40:28,788 --> 00:40:32,268
You did. Thirty-five years from now,
you reprogrammed me...

264
00:40:32,393 --> 00:40:35,104
to be your protector here,
in this time.

265
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:37,952
Oh, this is deep.

266
00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:03,465
So this other guy,
he's a Terminator like you, right?

267
00:41:03,757 --> 00:41:07,177
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

268
00:41:08,762 --> 00:41:13,309
You mean, more advanced than you
are? Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

269
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:15,186
What the hell does that mean?

270
00:41:15,356 --> 00:41:16,891
Liquid metal.

271
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:19,525
Where are we going?

272
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:22,945
We have to get out of the city immediately
and avoid the authorities.

273
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:26,781
Listen. I gotta stop by my house.
I wanna pick up some stuff.

274
00:41:26,906 --> 00:41:30,325
Negative. The T-1000 would
definitely try to reacquire you there.

275
00:41:30,818 --> 00:41:33,044
- You sure?
- I would.

276
00:41:44,048 --> 00:41:47,050
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks,

277
00:41:48,778 --> 00:41:50,388
but I gotta warn 'em.

278
00:41:50,513 --> 00:41:53,140
Shit. You got a quarter?

279
00:42:01,803 --> 00:42:04,029
Hello.
Janelle, it's me.

280
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:07,156
John? Yeah. Is everything all right?

281
00:42:07,326 --> 00:42:09,658
Are you guys okay? Sure,
honey, everything's okay.

282
00:42:09,942 --> 00:42:12,514
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

283
00:42:12,913 --> 00:42:16,438
John, it's late. Honey, I was
beginning to worry about you.

284
00:42:16,563 --> 00:42:19,244
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

285
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:23,294
- I'm making beef stew.
- Something's wrong. She's never this nice.

286
00:42:23,419 --> 00:42:25,549
John? Where are you?

287
00:42:25,674 --> 00:42:28,718
What the hell is
the goddamn dog barking at?

288
00:42:28,843 --> 00:42:31,721
Hey! Shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

289
00:42:31,846 --> 00:42:33,641
The dog's really barking.

290
00:42:33,811 --> 00:42:37,818
I thought you were gonna tell the
kid to get rid of that fucking mutt.

291
00:42:38,709 --> 00:42:41,817
John, honey, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

292
00:42:42,555 --> 00:42:44,808
Could he already be there?

293
00:42:45,714 --> 00:42:48,822
- Honey, are you okay?
- I'm right here. I'm fine.

294
00:42:48,947 --> 00:42:50,907
Are you sure you're all right?

295
00:42:51,304 --> 00:42:53,834
What's the dog's name?
Max.

296
00:42:54,265 --> 00:42:56,746
Hey, Janelle.
What's wrong with Wolfie?

297
00:42:57,055 --> 00:42:59,416
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

298
00:42:59,587 --> 00:43:02,553
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

299
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,017
Where are you?

300
00:43:06,886 --> 00:43:09,140
Your foster parents are dead.

301
00:43:45,754 --> 00:43:47,631
Oh. I need a minute here.

302
00:43:47,756 --> 00:43:52,010
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

303
00:43:52,135 --> 00:43:55,305
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

304
00:43:55,617 --> 00:44:00,310
Get real. Like, it could disguise
itself as a pack ofcigarettes?

305
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,439
No, only an object
of equal size.

306
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:05,067
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

307
00:44:05,235 --> 00:44:07,067
It can't form complex machines.

308
00:44:07,192 --> 00:44:09,986
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

309
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,180
It doesn't work that way.
But it can form solid metal shapes.

310
00:44:13,305 --> 00:44:16,161
- Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.

311
00:45:56,343 --> 00:45:57,597
<i>Messages from Mom</i>

312
00:46:12,985 --> 00:46:15,863
These were taken by
a video surveillance camera...

313
00:46:15,988 --> 00:46:19,532
at the West Highland Police Station
in 1984.

314
00:46:20,785 --> 00:46:23,620
He killed 17 police officers
that night.

315
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:27,290
Men with families,

316
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:30,496
children.

317
00:46:31,962 --> 00:46:34,342
These were taken at
a mall in Reseda...

318
00:46:34,747 --> 00:46:35,853
today.

319
00:46:37,718 --> 00:46:41,137
Miss Connor, we know
you know who this guy is.

320
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:46,936
Look, I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing,

321
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:50,857
that the foster parents
have been murdered.

322
00:46:50,982 --> 00:46:52,902
We know this guy's involved.

323
00:46:54,028 --> 00:46:57,404
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

324
00:47:01,904 --> 00:47:03,705
We're wasting our time.

325
00:47:04,323 --> 00:47:07,122
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry, guys.

326
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:12,881
She's just grown more and more
disconnected from reality as time goes on.

327
00:47:13,051 --> 00:47:15,006
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

328
00:47:15,131 --> 00:47:18,218
If she cleab at all and can
give us anything, then I'll call you.

329
00:47:18,576 --> 00:47:19,576
Sure.

330
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:24,310
Douglas, take her back to
her room, please. Yes, sir.

331
00:47:25,934 --> 00:47:28,145
Come on, sweetheart.
Let's go.

332
00:47:28,316 --> 00:47:29,789
You see,

333
00:47:30,411 --> 00:47:34,027
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua
and places like that.

334
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:39,100
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

335
00:47:39,225 --> 00:47:40,657
running guns.

336
00:47:40,782 --> 00:47:43,285
Then there were some other guys.

337
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:45,829
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from...

338
00:47:45,954 --> 00:47:49,043
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

339
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,544
Then she gets busted.

340
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:56,589
It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

341
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:02,640
It's like everything I've been brought up
to believe was all made-up bullshit.

342
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:05,392
I hated her for that.

343
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:11,137
But everything she said was true.

344
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:14,289
She knew,

345
00:48:16,683 --> 00:48:18,729
and nobody believed her,

346
00:48:20,616 --> 00:48:22,364
not even me.

347
00:48:23,992 --> 00:48:26,203
Listen. We gotta get her
out of there.

348
00:48:26,328 --> 00:48:29,749
Negative. The T-1000's highest
probability for success now...

349
00:48:29,919 --> 00:48:32,876
will be to copy Sarah Connor and to
wait foryou to make contact with her.

350
00:48:33,047 --> 00:48:35,045
Great. What happens to her?

351
00:48:35,216 --> 00:48:38,007
Typically, the subject
being copied is terminated.

352
00:48:38,177 --> 00:48:41,551
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

353
00:48:41,676 --> 00:48:43,595
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

354
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,723
Fuck you!
She's a priority to me!

355
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,643
Hey, goddamn it! What's
your problem? Goddamn it!

356
00:48:50,945 --> 00:48:53,482
Help!
This does not help our mission.

357
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:56,026
Get this psycho off of me!
Help!

358
00:48:56,195 --> 00:48:59,155
I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

359
00:48:59,324 --> 00:49:00,720
Let me go!

360
00:49:04,912 --> 00:49:06,619
Why the hell did you do that?

361
00:49:06,907 --> 00:49:08,580
Because you told me to.

362
00:49:11,456 --> 00:49:12,456
What?

363
00:49:17,713 --> 00:49:19,884
You have to do what I say?

364
00:49:20,054 --> 00:49:22,178
That's one of my mission parameters.

365
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,579
Prove it.

366
00:49:25,432 --> 00:49:26,974
Stand on one foot.

367
00:49:29,372 --> 00:49:30,395
Yes!

368
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,313
Cool. My own Terminator.

369
00:49:37,784 --> 00:49:39,069
You okay, kid?

370
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:43,117
- Take a hike, bozo.
- See? Let's get outta here, man.

371
00:49:43,242 --> 00:49:45,159
What?
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

372
00:49:45,924 --> 00:49:47,242
Dipshit?

373
00:49:49,412 --> 00:49:51,097
Put your leg down.

374
00:49:51,705 --> 00:49:54,625
Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit?

375
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,627
Just trying to help this punk.

376
00:49:56,752 --> 00:49:58,963
Grab this guy. I can't
believe he called me a dipshit.

377
00:50:00,276 --> 00:50:01,799
Get him off of me!

378
00:50:01,971 --> 00:50:04,850
Now who's the dipshit,
you jock douche bag?

379
00:50:04,975 --> 00:50:06,330
Get off of him!

380
00:50:12,601 --> 00:50:14,896
No!
Holy shit.

381
00:50:15,021 --> 00:50:16,872
Put the gun down now!

382
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,864
Get outta here! Come on,
Gus. Let's split! Come on!

383
00:50:27,655 --> 00:50:29,742
Jesus!
You were gonna kill that guy!

384
00:50:29,867 --> 00:50:31,789
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

385
00:50:33,873 --> 00:50:36,667
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

386
00:50:36,995 --> 00:50:39,967
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

387
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,209
You got that?

388
00:50:42,452 --> 00:50:44,927
You just can't go around
killing people.

389
00:50:45,097 --> 00:50:46,097
Why?

390
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:49,140
What do you mean, why?
'Cause you can't.

391
00:50:49,426 --> 00:50:50,183
Why?

392
00:50:50,351 --> 00:50:53,061
Because you just can't, okay?
Trust me on this.

393
00:50:59,058 --> 00:51:02,251
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom,

394
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:05,445
and I order you to help me.

395
00:53:31,145 --> 00:53:32,145
Hi.

396
00:53:33,051 --> 00:53:35,180
You have a Sarah Connor here?

397
00:53:35,305 --> 00:53:37,225
You're runnin' kind of late,
aren't ya?

398
00:53:37,538 --> 00:53:39,749
They've been in there for an hour.

399
00:53:39,874 --> 00:53:42,777
Hold on a second.
I'll buzz you in.

400
00:53:43,979 --> 00:53:46,896
Oh, here comes your friends now.

401
00:54:49,755 --> 00:54:52,755
Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?
No, thanks.

402
00:54:53,259 --> 00:54:56,180
How 'bout a beer?
Yeah, right.

403
00:55:20,129 --> 00:55:23,289
Hey, I got a full house.
That's good, Lewis.

404
00:55:23,461 --> 00:55:25,576
Must be my lucky day.

405
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:08,788
Shut up!

406
00:57:48,477 --> 00:57:50,937
Yeah, I think you're right
about number 24.

407
00:57:51,062 --> 00:57:53,857
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

408
00:57:53,982 --> 00:57:55,051
Same time?

409
00:58:11,735 --> 00:58:12,735
You!

410
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:18,551
You broke my arm.

411
00:58:18,721 --> 00:58:21,259
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

412
00:58:21,384 --> 00:58:23,725
That's one.
Now, don't move.

413
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:25,149
All right.

414
00:58:29,935 --> 00:58:31,772
What are you going to do?

415
00:58:35,232 --> 00:58:37,233
Why do we stop now?

416
00:58:38,606 --> 00:58:42,490
Now, you gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

417
00:58:42,615 --> 00:58:44,454
- Right.
- Swear?

418
00:58:45,279 --> 00:58:46,279
What?

419
00:58:46,785 --> 00:58:50,705
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

420
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:53,501
I swear I will not kill anyone.

421
00:58:54,515 --> 00:58:56,326
All right. Let's go.

422
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:04,055
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,

423
00:59:04,225 --> 00:59:06,271
Monday through Friday.

424
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:14,697
- What the hell are you doing?
- You son of a bitch! You shot me!

425
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:19,018
Crazy bastard! Oh, God!

426
00:59:21,493 --> 00:59:23,658
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

427
00:59:25,497 --> 00:59:27,231
Oh, my leg.

428
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:28,876
He'll live.

429
00:59:43,701 --> 00:59:45,180
Son of a bitch!

430
00:59:46,853 --> 00:59:50,394
Let's all try to remain calm. Open it,
or he'll be dead before he hits the floor.

431
00:59:50,562 --> 00:59:52,685
There's no way, Connor.
Let him go.

432
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:55,229
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

433
00:59:55,354 --> 00:59:57,231
Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.

434
00:59:57,356 --> 01:00:00,443
It won't work, Sarah. You're no killer.
I don't believe you can do it.

435
01:00:00,568 --> 01:00:03,711
You're already dead, Silberman.
Everybody dies. You know I believe it.

436
01:00:03,836 --> 01:00:05,607
So don't fuck with me!

437
01:00:05,732 --> 01:00:07,120
Open the door!

438
01:00:08,998 --> 01:00:10,087
Open it.

439
01:00:13,789 --> 01:00:15,512
Back off!

440
01:00:16,089 --> 01:00:17,417
Get back!

441
01:00:17,591 --> 01:00:20,715
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear! Back, back, back.

442
01:00:21,279 --> 01:00:22,843
Don't move!

443
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:26,943
- Drop the shit!
- Do it. Do it!

444
01:00:27,564 --> 01:00:29,180
Get in the office.

445
01:00:29,305 --> 01:00:31,182
On the floor, face down.
Not you!

446
01:00:31,307 --> 01:00:33,059
Open the door.

447
01:00:35,984 --> 01:00:38,480
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

448
01:00:55,247 --> 01:00:57,015
Get her. Get her!

449
01:01:22,614 --> 01:01:24,584
Sarah! Sarah!

450
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:27,824
Hurry up! Open the door!
The door's locked!

451
01:01:29,031 --> 01:01:30,786
Let's go! Come on! Open it!

452
01:01:30,957 --> 01:01:33,244
- Let's go, let's go!
- Come on, come on!

453
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:35,249
She broke it off.
Open it!

454
01:01:40,758 --> 01:01:42,965
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

455
01:01:43,135 --> 01:01:44,475
Come on!

456
01:02:13,285 --> 01:02:16,250
- No!
- Mom, wait!

457
01:02:16,648 --> 01:02:17,648
Mom!

458
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:25,964
- Come back here!
- No!

459
01:02:26,469 --> 01:02:28,515
No! No!

460
01:02:28,806 --> 01:02:30,346
- Help her!
- Wait here.

461
01:02:30,516 --> 01:02:32,928
Hurry up! Hurry up!
He'll kill us all!

462
01:02:33,053 --> 01:02:35,519
- He'll kill us all!
- Hold her.

463
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:39,167
He'll kill us all!

464
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:03,375
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

465
01:03:07,462 --> 01:03:09,677
Come with me
if you want to live.

466
01:03:09,847 --> 01:03:12,802
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help. It's okay.

467
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,560
Go.

468
01:04:10,492 --> 01:04:12,908
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

469
01:04:27,795 --> 01:04:29,629
Get down.

470
01:04:46,443 --> 01:04:47,443
Mom!

471
01:05:05,654 --> 01:05:07,005
Out of the car!

472
01:05:08,509 --> 01:05:09,591
Right now!

473
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:35,159
Go!

474
01:05:46,574 --> 01:05:47,597
I'm out.

475
01:05:54,471 --> 01:05:56,341
- Come on.
- Here.

476
01:05:58,933 --> 01:05:59,933
Reload.

477
01:06:09,945 --> 01:06:10,945
Last one!

478
01:06:19,121 --> 01:06:20,363
Hang on.

479
01:06:47,021 --> 01:06:48,196
Ready!

480
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:54,843
John!

481
01:07:02,703 --> 01:07:03,915
Here, drive.

482
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:59,696
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

483
01:07:59,821 --> 01:08:01,675
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

484
01:08:04,179 --> 01:08:07,561
- Can you even see anything?
- I see everything.

485
01:08:10,681 --> 01:08:11,690
Cool.

486
01:08:15,774 --> 01:08:17,691
Come here.

487
01:08:23,455 --> 01:08:25,120
I said I was okay!

488
01:08:26,534 --> 01:08:29,040
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

489
01:08:29,413 --> 01:08:32,294
Goddamn it.
You have to be smarter than that.

490
01:08:32,464 --> 01:08:34,890
You almost got yourself killed.

491
01:08:35,139 --> 01:08:36,924
What were you thinking?

492
01:08:37,908 --> 01:08:40,590
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

493
01:08:40,715 --> 01:08:43,627
Do you understand?
You're too important.

494
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:46,254
Do you understand?

495
01:08:49,523 --> 01:08:50,523
But...

496
01:08:52,102 --> 01:08:54,856
I had to get you out of that place.

497
01:08:54,981 --> 01:08:56,693
I'm sorry.

498
01:08:56,818 --> 01:08:59,405
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

499
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:08,247
What's wrong with your eyes?

500
01:09:10,403 --> 01:09:11,855
Nothin'.

501
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:23,692
So, what's your story?

502
01:09:34,854 --> 01:09:36,855
- You okay?
- Fine.

503
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:42,323
Say, that's a nice bike.

504
01:10:04,383 --> 01:10:06,635
Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.

505
01:10:14,162 --> 01:10:17,093
Listen. Do you know
what you're doing?

506
01:10:17,577 --> 01:10:20,320
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

507
01:10:21,523 --> 01:10:22,643
I bet.

508
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:27,202
Makes you a more efficient
killer, right? Correct.

509
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:35,540
Does it hurt when you get shot?

510
01:10:35,713 --> 01:10:39,737
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain."

511
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:45,632
John, help me with the light.
Will these heal up?

512
01:10:45,758 --> 01:10:47,679
- Yes.
- Good.

513
01:10:47,975 --> 01:10:51,013
If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

514
01:10:51,138 --> 01:10:54,068
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

515
01:10:54,193 --> 01:10:57,190
A hundred and twenty years,
with my existing power cell.

516
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,064
Can you learn stuff that you
haven't been programmed with...

517
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:01,749
so you can be,

518
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:05,350
you know, more human...

519
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:08,322
and not such a dork
all the time?

520
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:15,079
My C.P.U. is a neural net processor,
a learning computer,

521
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:18,707
but Skynet presets the switch to read
only when we're sent out alone.

522
01:11:21,044 --> 01:11:24,641
Doesn't want you to do
too much thinking, huh? No.

523
01:11:26,437 --> 01:11:28,483
Can we reset the switch?

524
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:50,359
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

525
01:11:57,034 --> 01:11:58,071
Do it.

526
01:12:06,757 --> 01:12:08,758
Now open the port cover.

527
01:12:11,762 --> 01:12:13,929
Pull, to break the seal.

528
01:12:17,768 --> 01:12:21,270
Good. Now remove
the shock-damping assembly.

529
01:12:25,028 --> 01:12:27,230
You can now access the C.P.U.

530
01:12:28,436 --> 01:12:30,534
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

531
01:12:30,704 --> 01:12:33,157
Pull the C.P.U. beds base tab.

532
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:35,820
Pull.

533
01:13:13,373 --> 01:13:15,405
Can you see the pin switch?

534
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:17,081
No, no!

535
01:13:18,411 --> 01:13:20,706
Out of my way, John.
Don't kill him.

536
01:13:21,483 --> 01:13:23,971
"It," John, not "him." "It."

537
01:13:24,371 --> 01:13:27,440
Okay. "It."
But we need "it."

538
01:13:28,024 --> 01:13:30,250
Listen to me. You listen.

539
01:13:30,507 --> 01:13:32,551
We are better off on our own.

540
01:13:32,724 --> 01:13:37,133
But he's the only proof we have
of the future and the war and all that!

541
01:13:37,387 --> 01:13:38,478
Maybe.

542
01:13:41,217 --> 01:13:43,028
I don't trust it.

543
01:13:43,317 --> 01:13:44,901
But he's my friend, all right?

544
01:13:45,926 --> 01:13:48,818
You don't know what it's like
to try to kill one of these things.

545
01:13:48,943 --> 01:13:52,200
And if something goes wrong, this
could be our last chance, so move!

546
01:13:52,363 --> 01:13:54,782
If I'm ever supposed to be
this great military leader,

547
01:13:54,907 --> 01:13:58,290
maybe you should start listening to
my leadership ideas once in a while!

548
01:14:00,634 --> 01:14:02,999
Cause if my own mother won't,

549
01:14:03,124 --> 01:14:05,570
how do you expect
anyone else to?

550
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:23,189
All right. Play it your way.

551
01:14:30,735 --> 01:14:32,699
Was there a problem?

552
01:14:32,869 --> 01:14:34,278
No problem.

553
01:14:35,413 --> 01:14:37,203
None whatsoever.

554
01:15:11,017 --> 01:15:13,194
Are we learning yet?

555
01:15:25,331 --> 01:15:28,333
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

556
01:15:32,213 --> 01:15:34,214
Just head south.

557
01:15:42,269 --> 01:15:43,982
Keep it under 65.

558
01:15:44,107 --> 01:15:46,817
We don't want to be
pulled over. Affirmative.

559
01:15:47,685 --> 01:15:49,648
No, no, no, no, no.

560
01:15:50,127 --> 01:15:52,692
You gotta listen to the way
people talk.

561
01:15:52,817 --> 01:15:56,237
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

562
01:15:56,479 --> 01:15:58,542
You say, "No problemo."

563
01:15:58,829 --> 01:16:02,664
And if someone comes off to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me."

564
01:16:02,834 --> 01:16:07,002
And if you want to shine them on,
it's "Hasta la vista, baby."

565
01:16:07,767 --> 01:16:09,937
Hasta la vista, baby.

566
01:16:10,376 --> 01:16:12,378
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

567
01:16:12,552 --> 01:16:14,964
And if someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

568
01:16:15,089 --> 01:16:16,971
Or you could do combinations.

569
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,893
Chill out, dick-wad.

570
01:16:20,428 --> 01:16:22,852
That's great!
See? You're getting it.

571
01:16:23,138 --> 01:16:24,562
No problemo.

572
01:16:35,193 --> 01:16:36,904
You got any cash?

573
01:16:37,029 --> 01:16:40,557
I got a couple hundred bucks.
I'll give you half.

574
01:16:40,866 --> 01:16:43,031
- Mom!
- Okay.

575
01:16:43,618 --> 01:16:45,725
- Get some food.
- Geez.

576
01:16:47,835 --> 01:16:49,957
No sense of humor.

577
01:16:55,255 --> 01:16:57,299
And that's another thing.

578
01:16:57,424 --> 01:16:59,927
You can lighten up a bit
yourself.

579
01:17:00,052 --> 01:17:02,054
This severe routine
is getting old, okay?

580
01:17:02,179 --> 01:17:04,180
I mean, you're acting
like such a geek.

581
01:17:04,306 --> 01:17:07,063
- Smile once in a while.
- Smile?

582
01:17:07,559 --> 01:17:10,021
Yeah. You know, smile.

583
01:17:10,477 --> 01:17:11,500
Watch.

584
01:17:12,571 --> 01:17:16,197
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

585
01:17:17,162 --> 01:17:18,876
Give me a break.

586
01:17:19,989 --> 01:17:22,436
Okay. Bad example.

587
01:17:23,124 --> 01:17:24,705
See that guy over there?

588
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:26,539
That's a smile.

589
01:17:37,195 --> 01:17:38,854
You're crazy.

590
01:17:46,471 --> 01:17:50,784
That's good. Maybe you could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

591
01:17:57,943 --> 01:17:59,944
Want some of my fries?

592
01:18:09,913 --> 01:18:12,415
- Need any help?
- No.

593
01:18:13,542 --> 01:18:16,808
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

594
01:18:17,136 --> 01:18:19,006
I came around here and got you!

595
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:21,049
No, you didn't!

596
01:18:21,174 --> 01:18:22,772
I told you I'm...

597
01:18:23,748 --> 01:18:26,278
We're not gonna make it, are we?

598
01:18:28,586 --> 01:18:29,937
People, I mean.

599
01:18:33,103 --> 01:18:36,106
It's in your nature
to destroyyourselves.

600
01:18:36,231 --> 01:18:39,026
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

601
01:18:39,151 --> 01:18:42,445
Break it up before I wring
both ofyour necks. Come on.

602
01:18:44,066 --> 01:18:47,164
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

603
01:18:47,334 --> 01:18:52,012
Who's responsible? The man most directly
responsible is Miles Bennett Dyson.

604
01:18:52,703 --> 01:18:54,030
Who is that?

605
01:18:54,155 --> 01:18:58,302
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

606
01:19:00,727 --> 01:19:02,247
Why him?

607
01:19:02,565 --> 01:19:07,138
In a few months he creates a
revolutionary type of microprocessor.

608
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:09,163
Go on. Then what?

609
01:19:09,288 --> 01:19:11,358
In three years
Cyberdyne will become the

610
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:13,817
largest supplier of
military computer systems.

611
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:16,691
All stealth bombers
are upgraded with

612
01:19:16,703 --> 01:19:19,317
Cyberdyne computers,
becoming fully unmanned.

613
01:19:19,442 --> 01:19:22,491
Afterwards they fly
with a perfect operational record.

614
01:19:22,993 --> 01:19:25,281
The SKYnet funding bill is passed.

615
01:19:25,406 --> 01:19:28,576
The system goes online
on August 4, 1997.

616
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:31,913
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

617
01:19:32,038 --> 01:19:34,628
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

618
01:19:34,798 --> 01:19:39,007
It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m.
Eastern time, August 29.

619
01:19:40,071 --> 01:19:43,209
In a panic
they try to pull the plug.

620
01:19:43,831 --> 01:19:46,056
- SKYnet fights back.
- Yes.

621
01:19:46,347 --> 01:19:49,893
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

622
01:19:50,063 --> 01:19:52,020
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

623
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:53,614
Because Skynet knows that...

624
01:19:53,739 --> 01:19:56,484
the Russian counterattack will eliminate
its enemies over here.

625
01:19:56,969 --> 01:19:58,254
Jesus.

626
01:20:00,858 --> 01:20:02,734
How much do you know
about Dyson?

627
01:20:04,975 --> 01:20:07,201
I have detailed files.

628
01:20:08,197 --> 01:20:10,729
I want to know everything.

629
01:20:11,202 --> 01:20:14,780
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

630
01:20:26,986 --> 01:20:28,301
Miles?

631
01:20:30,978 --> 01:20:32,043
Miles.

632
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,577
You gonna work all day?

633
01:20:52,702 --> 01:20:56,330
I'm sorry, baby, but this thing
isjust kicking my ass.

634
01:20:56,505 --> 01:21:00,547
Miles, it's Sunday. You promised to
take the kids to Raging Waters today.

635
01:21:02,153 --> 01:21:03,466
I can't.

636
01:21:04,355 --> 01:21:05,969
I'm on a roll.

637
01:21:18,945 --> 01:21:21,314
Baby, this is
gonna blow 'em all away.

638
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:24,318
- It's a neural net processor
- I know. I know. You told me.

639
01:21:24,443 --> 01:21:27,492
It's a neural net processor.
It thinks and learns like we do.

640
01:21:27,662 --> 01:21:30,157
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

641
01:21:30,282 --> 01:21:33,619
Other computers arejust
pocket calculators by comparison.

642
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:38,957
But why is that
so goddamn important, Miles?

643
01:21:39,082 --> 01:21:43,169
I really need to know, 'cause sometimes
I feel like I'm going crazy here.

644
01:21:44,262 --> 01:21:46,612
Baby, I am this close.

645
01:21:47,897 --> 01:21:49,139
Come here.

646
01:21:51,762 --> 01:21:53,933
Imagine a jet airliner...

647
01:21:54,349 --> 01:21:57,023
with a pilot that never gets tired,
never makes mistakes,

648
01:21:57,191 --> 01:21:58,983
never shows up to work
with a hangover.

649
01:22:01,506 --> 01:22:03,262
Meet the pilot.

650
01:22:03,815 --> 01:22:08,070
Why did we get married, Miles? Why did
we have these children? You don't need us.

651
01:22:08,244 --> 01:22:11,585
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

652
01:22:12,069 --> 01:22:14,950
But it doesn't love you like we do.

653
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,997
I'm sorry. Really.

654
01:22:25,882 --> 01:22:29,545
How 'bout spending some time
with your other babies?

655
01:22:32,423 --> 01:22:34,185
- Raging Waters!
- Yeah!

656
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,584
Wait in the car.

657
01:23:24,354 --> 01:23:28,107
<i>Enrique! Estas aqui?</i>

658
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:45,799
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

659
01:23:47,761 --> 01:23:49,011
<i>Y tú.</i>

660
01:23:51,807 --> 01:23:53,899
<i>Siempre como culebra.</i>

661
01:24:02,485 --> 01:24:03,485
Yolanda!

662
01:24:06,795 --> 01:24:08,321
Hey, big John.

663
01:24:08,491 --> 01:24:10,115
What's up?

664
01:24:12,828 --> 01:24:16,433
He's cool, Enrique. He's with me.
He's... Uncle Bob.

665
01:24:17,241 --> 01:24:19,248
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

666
01:24:19,618 --> 01:24:21,208
Uncle Bob?

667
01:24:22,389 --> 01:24:24,185
Okay. Okay.

668
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:27,043
<i>- Juanito!
- Cómo esta?</i>

669
01:24:27,168 --> 01:24:29,712
<i>Cómo estas?</i>

670
01:24:30,497 --> 01:24:31,497
Drink?

671
01:24:37,068 --> 01:24:38,184
"Uncle Bob"?

672
01:24:40,431 --> 01:24:43,267
You're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn TV.

673
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:46,270
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

674
01:24:46,395 --> 01:24:49,347
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

675
01:24:51,826 --> 01:24:55,363
I just came for my stuff. I need
clothes, food and one of your trucks.

676
01:24:55,488 --> 01:24:57,828
How about the fillings
out of my fucking teeth?

677
01:24:57,998 --> 01:25:00,008
Now, Enrique.

678
01:25:01,452 --> 01:25:03,626
You two,
you're on weapons detail.

679
01:25:03,916 --> 01:25:05,378
Come on, let's go.

680
01:25:26,018 --> 01:25:28,186
One thing about my mom...

681
01:25:30,147 --> 01:25:32,148
she always plans ahead.

682
01:25:42,243 --> 01:25:44,119
Excellent.

683
01:25:53,415 --> 01:25:54,589
Shit!

684
01:25:54,764 --> 01:25:58,222
This is the best truck I got,
but the starter motor's gone.

685
01:25:58,347 --> 01:26:00,468
You got the time to change it out?

686
01:26:00,595 --> 01:26:04,140
Yeah. I'm gonna wait till
dark to cross the border. Okay.

687
01:26:04,265 --> 01:26:07,019
Enrique, it's dangerous
for you here.

688
01:26:07,144 --> 01:26:09,068
You get out tonight too.
Okay?

689
01:26:09,547 --> 01:26:10,547
Sure.

690
01:26:11,662 --> 01:26:15,450
Just drop by any time
and totally fuck up my life, all right?

691
01:26:19,998 --> 01:26:23,117
See, I grew up in places like this,

692
01:26:23,573 --> 01:26:26,780
so I just thought
that's how people lived...

693
01:26:27,153 --> 01:26:29,808
riding around in helicopters,

694
01:26:30,992 --> 01:26:33,259
learning how to blow shit up.

695
01:26:34,797 --> 01:26:39,717
But then when my mom got busted
I got put in a regular school.

696
01:26:40,643 --> 01:26:43,463
All the other kids
were into Nintendo.

697
01:26:57,778 --> 01:26:59,738
Are you ever afraid?

698
01:26:59,863 --> 01:27:00,863
No.

699
01:27:05,069 --> 01:27:06,667
Not even of dying?

700
01:27:07,553 --> 01:27:08,604
No.

701
01:27:13,669 --> 01:27:17,798
You don't feel any emotion about it
one way or another?

702
01:27:17,923 --> 01:27:22,093
No. I have to stay functional
until my mission is complete.

703
01:27:27,265 --> 01:27:29,142
Then it doesn't matter.

704
01:27:29,267 --> 01:27:31,687
Yeah.
I have to stay functional too.

705
01:27:32,176 --> 01:27:33,735
I'm too important.

706
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:51,920
That's definitely you.

707
01:28:03,218 --> 01:28:06,095
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with, were geeks,

708
01:28:06,388 --> 01:28:09,641
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

709
01:28:09,766 --> 01:28:11,768
He taught me engines.

710
01:28:11,893 --> 01:28:13,380
Hold here.

711
01:28:14,057 --> 01:28:16,398
Mom screwed it up, of course.

712
01:28:16,523 --> 01:28:18,817
She'd always tell 'em
about Judgment Day...

713
01:28:18,942 --> 01:28:21,236
and me being this world leader.

714
01:28:21,361 --> 01:28:23,830
That'd be all she wrote.

715
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,413
Torque wrench, please.

716
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:29,789
Here.

717
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:33,041
I wish I could've met
my real dad.

718
01:28:33,166 --> 01:28:34,851
You will.

719
01:28:35,168 --> 01:28:36,910
Yeah, I guess.

720
01:28:37,336 --> 01:28:40,007
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

721
01:28:41,257 --> 01:28:44,340
They sent him back through time
to 1984.

722
01:28:44,956 --> 01:28:46,145
Man.

723
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:51,042
He hasn't even been born yet.

724
01:28:52,268 --> 01:28:54,769
It messes with your head.

725
01:28:56,952 --> 01:28:59,482
The other bolt.
Oh. Here.

726
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:09,702
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

727
01:29:09,827 --> 01:29:12,246
She still loves him, I guess.

728
01:29:12,371 --> 01:29:14,979
I see her crying sometimes.

729
01:29:15,291 --> 01:29:19,961
She denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

730
01:29:24,198 --> 01:29:25,842
Why do you cry?

731
01:29:26,756 --> 01:29:28,470
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

732
01:29:28,595 --> 01:29:29,977
I don't know.

733
01:29:30,102 --> 01:29:31,475
We just cry,

734
01:29:32,152 --> 01:29:34,516
you know, when it hurts.

735
01:29:40,773 --> 01:29:42,860
Pain causes it?

736
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:45,619
No. It's different.

737
01:29:45,744 --> 01:29:48,947
It's when there's nothing wrong with you,
but you hurt anyways.

738
01:29:49,072 --> 01:29:50,718
- You get it?
- No.

739
01:29:52,294 --> 01:29:53,793
All right, my man!

740
01:29:54,249 --> 01:29:55,540
No problemo.

741
01:29:55,715 --> 01:29:57,085
Give me five.

742
01:29:59,444 --> 01:30:02,182
Just put out your hand like this.
Come on.

743
01:30:02,873 --> 01:30:06,968
All right! Now hit me. Give me five.
Do the same thing. Do the same thing.

744
01:30:07,236 --> 01:30:08,840
All right...

745
01:30:11,417 --> 01:30:14,273
Okay, that's good, that's good.
Up high, up high.

746
01:30:15,193 --> 01:30:16,409
Five low.

747
01:30:17,101 --> 01:30:18,235
Too slow.

748
01:30:21,366 --> 01:30:23,531
No. I'm just kidding.
Let's try it one more time.

749
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:25,825
Good. Now try it.
Good.

750
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:28,154
Now do me.
Give me five.

751
01:30:29,282 --> 01:30:33,911
<i>Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.</i>

752
01:30:34,182 --> 01:30:36,789
<i>The Terminator would never stop.</i>

753
01:30:36,914 --> 01:30:40,918
<i>It would never leave him
and it would never hurt him,</i>

754
01:30:41,093 --> 01:30:44,088
<i>never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him...</i>

755
01:30:44,213 --> 01:30:47,055
<i>or say it was too busy
to spend time with him.</i>

756
01:30:47,793 --> 01:30:50,094
<i>It would always be there...</i>

757
01:30:50,219 --> 01:30:52,700
<i>and it would die to protect him.</i>

758
01:30:54,223 --> 01:30:57,565
<i>Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years,</i>

759
01:30:57,735 --> 01:30:59,604
<i>this thing, this machine...</i>

760
01:30:59,729 --> 01:31:02,107
<i>was the only one
who measured up.</i>

761
01:31:02,837 --> 01:31:04,693
<i>In an insane world,</i>

762
01:31:04,818 --> 01:31:07,361
<i>it was the sanest choice.</i>

763
01:32:44,793 --> 01:32:47,198
Hey, let's try this one.

764
01:32:52,914 --> 01:32:54,186
Here we go.

765
01:34:40,502 --> 01:34:42,994
She said you go south with him
like you planned.

766
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:46,165
She'll meet you tomorrow
on the other side. Mom!

767
01:34:46,341 --> 01:34:48,131
Mom! Mom, wait!

768
01:35:03,446 --> 01:35:05,340
"No fate."

769
01:35:06,316 --> 01:35:08,854
No fate but what we make.

770
01:35:10,648 --> 01:35:12,656
My father told her this.

771
01:35:15,330 --> 01:35:19,768
I mean, I made him memorize it
in the future as a message to her.

772
01:35:21,254 --> 01:35:22,498
Never mind.

773
01:35:23,369 --> 01:35:26,142
Okay, the whole thing goes...

774
01:35:26,687 --> 01:35:28,719
The future's not set.

775
01:35:29,447 --> 01:35:32,751
There's no fate
but what we make for ourselves.

776
01:35:33,055 --> 01:35:35,864
She intends
to change the future.

777
01:35:36,173 --> 01:35:38,016
Yeah, I guess.

778
01:35:39,161 --> 01:35:40,640
Oh, shit!

779
01:35:41,055 --> 01:35:42,866
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

780
01:35:43,113 --> 01:35:45,864
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

781
01:35:46,458 --> 01:35:48,561
She's gonna blow him away!

782
01:35:48,686 --> 01:35:52,353
Come on! Let's go! Come on!
Let's go, let's go! Come on!

783
01:36:03,201 --> 01:36:06,413
This is tactically dangerous.
Drive faster.

784
01:36:06,589 --> 01:36:08,957
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do.

785
01:36:09,082 --> 01:36:12,503
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

786
01:36:12,628 --> 01:36:15,088
I don't care.
We gotta stop her.

787
01:36:15,264 --> 01:36:17,519
Killing Dyson
might actually prevent the war.

788
01:36:17,644 --> 01:36:21,263
I don't care!
Haven't you learned anything yet?

789
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:24,787
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

790
01:36:26,808 --> 01:36:31,438
Look, maybe you don't care if you live
or die, but everybody's not like that.

791
01:36:31,563 --> 01:36:35,156
We have feelings.
We hurt. We're afraid.

792
01:36:37,661 --> 01:36:41,030
You gotta learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

793
01:37:17,676 --> 01:37:21,619
Danny? Danny, I told you to
go to bed like your sister.

794
01:37:21,789 --> 01:37:24,198
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

795
01:37:41,209 --> 01:37:43,635
Danny, your time is up!

796
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,804
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

797
01:38:15,406 --> 01:38:16,717
Danny!

798
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:29,143
Daddy!

799
01:38:29,766 --> 01:38:32,102
Danny, just go! Go!
Danny, go!

800
01:38:33,904 --> 01:38:34,986
- Miles?
- Mom!

801
01:38:38,701 --> 01:38:41,492
- Miles?
- Run! Tarissa, run!

802
01:38:41,662 --> 01:38:43,303
Oh, my God!

803
01:38:49,837 --> 01:38:53,129
Tarissa, just take Danny and go!
Just run! Run!

804
01:38:53,299 --> 01:38:54,841
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

805
01:39:13,976 --> 01:39:15,769
- Daddy!
- Danny!

806
01:39:15,895 --> 01:39:18,029
- Danny!
- Nobody fucking move!

807
01:39:18,434 --> 01:39:21,741
- Don't hurt my daddy!
- Get down on the floor, bitch.

808
01:39:21,911 --> 01:39:23,993
- Get down now!
- Oh, God.

809
01:39:24,153 --> 01:39:25,947
Get out of the way!

810
01:39:26,123 --> 01:39:27,827
Don't hurt him!

811
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,888
Get on the floor now!

812
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:33,085
Come on. Come on.

813
01:39:34,076 --> 01:39:35,755
Just let the boy go.

814
01:39:35,915 --> 01:39:38,793
Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up! Shut up!

815
01:39:39,111 --> 01:39:41,461
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

816
01:39:41,639 --> 01:39:43,674
- It's all your fault!
- What?

817
01:39:43,974 --> 01:39:46,258
I'm not gonna let you do it.

818
01:40:38,024 --> 01:40:39,907
Shit! We're too late!

819
01:40:43,774 --> 01:40:45,693
Check them.

820
01:40:46,952 --> 01:40:47,952
God!

821
01:40:49,208 --> 01:40:51,241
Look at me, Mom.

822
01:40:51,531 --> 01:40:53,135
Are you hurt?

823
01:40:53,955 --> 01:40:55,419
Look at me.

824
01:40:57,414 --> 01:40:58,670
I almost...

825
01:40:59,984 --> 01:41:01,076
I almost...

826
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:13,347
It'll be okay, Mom.
It'll be okay.

827
01:41:13,472 --> 01:41:15,598
We'll figure something out.
Okay?

828
01:41:17,017 --> 01:41:18,650
I promise.

829
01:41:22,350 --> 01:41:24,742
You came here to stop me.

830
01:41:25,848 --> 01:41:27,272
Yeah, I did.

831
01:41:30,577 --> 01:41:32,388
I love you, John.

832
01:41:34,378 --> 01:41:36,272
I always have.

833
01:41:37,871 --> 01:41:39,120
I know.

834
01:41:46,447 --> 01:41:48,258
Deep penetration.

835
01:41:50,101 --> 01:41:52,640
No shattered bone.
Hold here.

836
01:41:52,888 --> 01:41:55,695
The pressure
should stop the bleeding.

837
01:42:05,947 --> 01:42:07,841
Who are you people?

838
01:42:08,187 --> 01:42:09,652
Show him.

839
01:42:12,290 --> 01:42:16,375
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Okay? Show me your room.

840
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:31,027
Oh, God!

841
01:42:44,563 --> 01:42:46,996
Oh, my God!

842
01:42:56,918 --> 01:42:58,084
Oh, my God.

843
01:42:58,370 --> 01:43:01,259
Now listen to me very carefully.

844
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:06,083
Nuclear winter effects
caused massive cooling.

845
01:43:06,804 --> 01:43:10,579
<i>Dyson listened
while the Terminator laid it all down.</i>

846
01:43:10,881 --> 01:43:13,781
<i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>

847
01:43:14,833 --> 01:43:17,475
<i>The history of things to come.</i>

848
01:43:18,473 --> 01:43:21,351
<i>It's not every day that
you find out you're responsible...</i>

849
01:43:21,476 --> 01:43:24,187
<i>for three billion deaths.</i>

850
01:43:24,312 --> 01:43:26,313
<i>He took it pretty well.</i>

851
01:43:28,308 --> 01:43:31,156
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

852
01:43:37,169 --> 01:43:38,868
You're judging me...

853
01:43:39,216 --> 01:43:42,204
on things I haven't even done yet.

854
01:43:45,785 --> 01:43:48,522
How were we supposed to know?

855
01:43:50,328 --> 01:43:52,996
Yeah. Right.

856
01:43:54,810 --> 01:43:57,405
How were you supposed to know?

857
01:43:58,132 --> 01:44:01,607
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

858
01:44:02,118 --> 01:44:04,185
Men like you...

859
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:06,311
thought it up.

860
01:44:09,713 --> 01:44:12,450
You think you're so creative.

861
01:44:12,883 --> 01:44:16,120
You don't know what it's like
to really create something,

862
01:44:16,290 --> 01:44:18,166
to create a life,

863
01:44:18,501 --> 01:44:20,368
to feel it growing inside you.

864
01:44:20,493 --> 01:44:23,923
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

865
01:44:24,882 --> 01:44:28,550
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

866
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:31,235
We still have to stop this from
happening, don't we?

867
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:32,784
But I thought...

868
01:44:33,714 --> 01:44:37,593
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

869
01:44:37,718 --> 01:44:42,181
That's right. There's no way I'm going
to finish the new processor. Not now.

870
01:44:42,306 --> 01:44:45,150
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

871
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:47,757
That's not good enough.

872
01:44:48,509 --> 01:44:51,456
- No one must follow your work.
- Right.

873
01:44:52,150 --> 01:44:56,404
All right, then... we have to
destroy all the stuff at the lab...

874
01:44:56,529 --> 01:45:00,363
the files, the disk drives, everything...
everything here.

875
01:45:01,503 --> 01:45:02,899
Everything.

876
01:45:03,244 --> 01:45:04,821
I don't care.

877
01:45:06,053 --> 01:45:08,423
The chip.
Do you know about the chip?

878
01:45:08,593 --> 01:45:10,842
- What chip?
- They keep it in a vault at Cyberdyne.

879
01:45:11,012 --> 01:45:14,797
- It must be from the other one like you.
- The C.P.U. from the first Terminator.

880
01:45:14,974 --> 01:45:17,265
Son of a bitch!
I knew it!

881
01:45:17,435 --> 01:45:20,059
They told us not to ask
where they got it.

882
01:45:20,229 --> 01:45:22,472
Those lying motherfuckers.

883
01:45:22,649 --> 01:45:24,355
It was scary stuff.
Radically advanced.

884
01:45:24,525 --> 01:45:28,276
It was smashed, it didn't work, but it
gave us ideas, took us in new directions.

885
01:45:28,446 --> 01:45:31,362
I mean,
things we would've never th...

886
01:45:33,606 --> 01:45:35,617
All my work was based on it.

887
01:45:35,787 --> 01:45:37,494
It must be destroyed.

888
01:45:39,067 --> 01:45:40,067
Right.

889
01:45:40,146 --> 01:45:42,558
Can you get us in?
Past security?

890
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:45,261
I think so, yeah. When?

891
01:45:49,888 --> 01:45:50,888
Now?

892
01:45:54,928 --> 01:45:57,758
<i>The future, always so clear to me,</i>

893
01:45:57,883 --> 01:46:00,928
<i>had become like
a black highway at night.</i>

894
01:46:01,053 --> 01:46:03,680
<i>We were in
uncharted territory now,</i>

895
01:46:03,805 --> 01:46:06,578
<i>making up history
as we went along.</i>

896
01:46:42,150 --> 01:46:43,150
Hi.

897
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:47,015
Carl, right?

898
01:46:47,411 --> 01:46:50,393
Friends from out oftown.
I just thought I'd...

899
01:46:50,519 --> 01:46:53,821
Hi. Take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

900
01:46:53,991 --> 01:46:57,199
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

901
01:46:57,369 --> 01:46:59,410
I need written authorization...

902
01:47:00,529 --> 01:47:02,196
I insist.

903
01:47:02,665 --> 01:47:04,331
Don't even think about it.

904
01:47:15,127 --> 01:47:18,005
Come on. It's okay.

905
01:47:18,130 --> 01:47:21,258
It takes two keys to open the vault.
They have to be turned simultaneously.

906
01:47:21,383 --> 01:47:24,385
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

907
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:26,900
Gibbons?

908
01:47:30,142 --> 01:47:32,019
Gibbons! Come on, man!

909
01:47:32,144 --> 01:47:35,022
You can't leave the desk like that!

910
01:47:35,269 --> 01:47:36,320
Shit.

911
01:47:37,556 --> 01:47:38,676
Gibbons.

912
01:47:40,058 --> 01:47:41,372
Oh, shit.

913
01:47:47,811 --> 01:47:48,811
Okay.

914
01:47:59,054 --> 01:48:01,056
My card should access this.

915
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:05,780
What?

916
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:07,768
- What is it?
- Damn it.

917
01:48:08,431 --> 01:48:10,837
The silent alarm's been tripped.

918
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:19,317
It's neutralized all the codes
in the entire building.

919
01:48:19,442 --> 01:48:21,819
Nothing will open anywhere now.

920
01:48:21,944 --> 01:48:23,821
We have to abort.

921
01:48:24,061 --> 01:48:25,167
No.

922
01:48:27,367 --> 01:48:30,300
We go all the way.
Okay?

923
01:48:31,615 --> 01:48:32,714
Okay.

924
01:48:32,883 --> 01:48:36,625
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

925
01:48:36,751 --> 01:48:39,629
I think it's that guy from the mall.
It is the guy!

926
01:48:39,754 --> 01:48:41,755
Yeah.
It's him and the woman.

927
01:48:42,757 --> 01:48:45,967
Just send everything
you got in the area right now.

928
01:48:48,137 --> 01:48:52,140
I have a personal entry code for the lab.
It may still work.

929
01:48:55,782 --> 01:48:57,113
It's no good.

930
01:48:57,282 --> 01:48:59,698
Let me try mine.

931
01:49:03,778 --> 01:49:05,862
John, fire in the hole!

932
01:49:18,393 --> 01:49:22,637
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set offthe Halon system.

933
01:49:29,866 --> 01:49:33,101
You have to wait a few minutes
until the gas clears.

934
01:49:34,865 --> 01:49:36,026
Put this on.

935
01:49:50,176 --> 01:49:52,346
All right, let's get to work.

936
01:50:13,639 --> 01:50:17,018
<i>All units in the
vicinity and all units able to respond,</i>

937
01:50:17,143 --> 01:50:21,773
<i>a 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer Street,
the Cyberdyne building.</i>

938
01:50:21,898 --> 01:50:23,775
<i>Suspect one is white female...</i>

939
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:27,195
<i>identified as last name Connor,
first name Sarah.</i>

940
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:30,114
<i>Escaped last night
from Pescadero State Hospital.</i>

941
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:32,208
<i>Suspect 2: White male.</i>

942
01:50:35,995 --> 01:50:37,955
All the discs in my office,

943
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,125
all the discs
in that offce over there,

944
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:42,503
everything behind my desk...

945
01:50:42,628 --> 01:50:44,755
and all the processors
on my left.

946
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:47,048
We'll blow those with the C-4.

947
01:51:00,943 --> 01:51:02,145
Can I, um...

948
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:04,941
Excuse me.

949
01:51:06,652 --> 01:51:08,819
Can I borrow that thing?

950
01:51:17,371 --> 01:51:20,289
I worked a lot of years
on this thing.

951
01:51:24,847 --> 01:51:26,879
1-Mary-3, give me that location again.

952
01:51:27,005 --> 01:51:31,809
<i>2111 Kramer. Suspects are armed
and considered extremely dangerous.</i>

953
01:51:44,053 --> 01:51:46,293
Sending the SWAT team.
Over.

954
01:52:24,345 --> 01:52:25,755
All right.

955
01:52:26,075 --> 01:52:27,732
7-2-5-6.

956
01:52:29,309 --> 01:52:30,309
Yes!

957
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:36,616
Easy money.

958
01:52:45,258 --> 01:52:48,628
Oh, shit. Not good.
Not good.

959
01:52:52,174 --> 01:52:54,051
How we doing?

960
01:52:54,176 --> 01:52:56,053
Primer cord is set.

961
01:52:56,178 --> 01:52:58,679
One more barrel,
two more minutes.

962
01:53:03,622 --> 01:53:05,156
Remote control.

963
01:53:05,668 --> 01:53:07,148
Piece of cake.

964
01:53:07,660 --> 01:53:09,366
- We got company.
- Police?

965
01:53:09,949 --> 01:53:12,673
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

966
01:53:13,076 --> 01:53:15,149
Go. I'll finish here.

967
01:53:16,407 --> 01:53:17,748
Come on.

968
01:53:18,837 --> 01:53:20,703
I'll take care of the police.

969
01:53:20,828 --> 01:53:23,205
Hey, wait! You swore!

970
01:53:25,072 --> 01:53:26,233
Trust me.

971
01:53:39,817 --> 01:53:41,474
You at the window!

972
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:44,902
Drop your weapons and place
your hands on top of your head!

973
01:53:46,323 --> 01:53:47,822
Holy shit!

974
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:49,658
That's a damn mini-gun!

975
01:54:11,921 --> 01:54:13,840
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

976
01:54:13,965 --> 01:54:15,892
Go! Go! Go! Go!

977
01:54:30,061 --> 01:54:31,264
Son of a bitch!

978
01:54:46,257 --> 01:54:47,534
Go! Go!

979
01:55:03,232 --> 01:55:04,232
Fire!

980
01:55:22,158 --> 01:55:24,035
Here we go.
Same time, to the left.

981
01:55:24,160 --> 01:55:26,643
One, two, three, go.

982
01:55:38,412 --> 01:55:41,311
All right, now, in order
to get that out you have to...

983
01:55:48,757 --> 01:55:52,656
We got Skynet by the balls now, don't we?
Come on, let's book.

984
01:55:53,816 --> 01:55:55,817
Hold your fire!

985
01:56:20,926 --> 01:56:23,427
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

986
01:56:26,610 --> 01:56:28,794
Time to go. Now.

987
01:56:29,351 --> 01:56:32,404
Take this. They'll use gas.
Come on.

988
01:56:32,574 --> 01:56:35,648
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

989
01:57:00,028 --> 01:57:02,475
Mom! Mom!

990
01:57:47,095 --> 01:57:48,095
Shit!

991
01:57:49,609 --> 01:57:52,896
She's in the corner,
and there's no way outta there.

992
01:58:01,910 --> 01:58:02,912
Get down!

993
01:58:10,511 --> 01:58:11,700
Here.

994
01:58:37,397 --> 01:58:40,857
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

995
01:58:45,242 --> 01:58:46,498
Fall back!

996
01:58:46,667 --> 01:58:50,011
Everybody out! Fall back now!
Go! Go! Go!

997
01:59:25,445 --> 01:59:27,497
<i>We got a war zone down here!</i>

998
01:59:59,926 --> 02:00:01,363
Shut your eyes.

999
02:00:07,987 --> 02:00:10,989
Stay here. I'll be back.

1000
02:00:18,843 --> 02:00:21,050
Get down on the floor!
Face down!

1001
02:00:24,099 --> 02:00:26,228
Get onto the floor now!

1002
02:00:27,928 --> 02:00:29,519
Okay, drop him!

1003
02:01:08,283 --> 02:01:10,685
God, it hurts!

1004
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:30,204
Take him out! Move out! Move out!

1005
02:01:49,184 --> 02:01:50,718
Here, hold this.

1006
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:05,044
Give me a hand!

1007
02:02:07,411 --> 02:02:08,592
Holy shit!

1008
02:02:23,860 --> 02:02:24,926
Go!

1009
02:03:03,967 --> 02:03:04,967
Shit!

1010
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:20,065
Get out.

1011
02:03:39,181 --> 02:03:43,213
Listen, no matter what happens,
you stay under these vests.

1012
02:03:43,383 --> 02:03:44,779
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1013
02:03:44,904 --> 02:03:46,189
All right.

1014
02:04:00,722 --> 02:04:03,140
- Chopper's coming in!
- It's him.

1015
02:05:00,948 --> 02:05:02,259
Shit!

1016
02:05:04,547 --> 02:05:06,242
John! Stay down!

1017
02:05:32,367 --> 02:05:33,416
Mom!

1018
02:06:14,370 --> 02:06:15,370
Hello?

1019
02:06:21,942 --> 02:06:23,656
Damn! You all right?

1020
02:06:30,059 --> 02:06:32,548
Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.

1021
02:06:35,556 --> 02:06:37,667
- Take the shotgun.
- Okay.

1022
02:06:40,569 --> 02:06:41,894
Are you hurt?

1023
02:06:54,704 --> 02:06:58,034
Holy shit. Come on, Mom.
Come on. Come on!

1024
02:06:58,204 --> 02:07:00,787
- We need your truck.
- Hurry! Come on.

1025
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:08,336
Come on. Hurry.
Get in.

1026
02:07:09,411 --> 02:07:11,818
Come on! Go!

1027
02:07:18,641 --> 02:07:20,127
What the hell...

1028
02:07:26,670 --> 02:07:29,190
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

1029
02:07:30,790 --> 02:07:32,485
Here. This'll work.

1030
02:07:38,202 --> 02:07:39,784
He's gaining.

1031
02:07:42,456 --> 02:07:45,289
- Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.

1032
02:07:45,459 --> 02:07:47,907
I can get out and run
faster than this!

1033
02:07:57,848 --> 02:08:00,213
He's coming up, to the right.

1034
02:08:01,502 --> 02:08:03,059
Watch it! Watch it!

1035
02:08:25,876 --> 02:08:27,875
- Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?

1036
02:08:34,884 --> 02:08:36,300
Take the off-ramp.

1037
02:08:47,272 --> 02:08:48,282
Shit!

1038
02:08:52,515 --> 02:08:54,516
Hold on!

1039
02:09:38,639 --> 02:09:39,745
Don't stop!

1040
02:09:47,791 --> 02:09:49,081
Go straight!

1041
02:09:51,836 --> 02:09:53,336
- Look out!
- Duck!

1042
02:10:08,275 --> 02:10:10,102
Get the hell outta here!

1043
02:10:15,818 --> 02:10:17,633
Get outta here!
Let's go!

1044
02:10:17,758 --> 02:10:19,764
Come on! Let's go!
Let's go!

1045
02:11:35,846 --> 02:11:38,347
Hasta la vista, baby.

1046
02:12:27,826 --> 02:12:29,160
We don't have much time.

1047
02:12:51,896 --> 02:12:53,209
Let's go.

1048
02:12:54,232 --> 02:12:56,997
Come on! Come on!
We gotta get outta here!

1049
02:12:57,122 --> 02:12:58,122
Get up!

1050
02:13:11,747 --> 02:13:13,371
Hand me the shotgun.

1051
02:13:18,295 --> 02:13:20,461
Put your weight on me, Mom.

1052
02:13:21,247 --> 02:13:22,247
Hurry!

1053
02:13:26,954 --> 02:13:28,386
Come on, Mom.

1054
02:13:34,503 --> 02:13:36,186
Come on, Mom! Get up!

1055
02:13:36,494 --> 02:13:37,584
Come on!

1056
02:14:07,845 --> 02:14:09,677
This way. Come on.
This way.

1057
02:14:29,191 --> 02:14:30,242
All right.

1058
02:14:36,579 --> 02:14:38,058
No! Wait!

1059
02:14:38,780 --> 02:14:42,509
Wait. No. No.
It's too hot. Go back. Go back.

1060
02:14:50,930 --> 02:14:53,127
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

1061
02:14:53,252 --> 02:14:55,181
John, you've got to go now.

1062
02:14:55,606 --> 02:14:57,391
- John!
- Go! Now!

1063
02:14:57,560 --> 02:14:58,560
No!

1064
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:14,042
Gotta get up the steps.

1065
02:16:15,836 --> 02:16:17,002
Go on.

1066
02:16:21,094 --> 02:16:22,593
Get up.
Get up.

1067
02:16:23,057 --> 02:16:25,481
Come on, Mom.
I got you. Come on up.

1068
02:16:50,905 --> 02:16:51,905
No.

1069
02:16:59,962 --> 02:17:02,575
Grab the chain. Grab it.

1070
02:17:03,667 --> 02:17:05,782
Grab it. Go. Go!

1071
02:17:16,838 --> 02:17:19,995
Mom, come on!
Mom! Mom!

1072
02:17:20,502 --> 02:17:21,898
Come on!

1073
02:17:22,575 --> 02:17:24,815
Mom, come on!

1074
02:17:25,621 --> 02:17:26,710
Mom!

1075
02:18:09,467 --> 02:18:10,891
Call to John.

1076
02:18:12,373 --> 02:18:13,452
No.

1077
02:18:14,042 --> 02:18:15,634
I know this hurts.

1078
02:18:17,871 --> 02:18:19,095
Call John.

1079
02:18:35,602 --> 02:18:38,270
Call to John now.

1080
02:18:40,201 --> 02:18:41,625
Fuck you.

1081
02:21:53,467 --> 02:21:56,998
John! Hey! John?

1082
02:21:58,305 --> 02:22:00,223
John? Help!

1083
02:22:03,241 --> 02:22:04,527
John.

1084
02:22:08,420 --> 02:22:09,457
John?

1085
02:22:12,353 --> 02:22:13,514
John.

1086
02:22:21,801 --> 02:22:23,299
Mom.
Help me.

1087
02:22:24,748 --> 02:22:26,749
Help me.

1088
02:22:28,473 --> 02:22:30,848
- Help me.
- Get out of the way, John.

1089
02:22:31,922 --> 02:22:34,227
John. John.

1090
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:35,520
Shoot!

1091
02:23:18,808 --> 02:23:19,831
Mom!

1092
02:23:30,203 --> 02:23:31,203
Get down!

1093
02:25:05,744 --> 02:25:08,246
Get up. Come on.

1094
02:25:09,832 --> 02:25:12,084
Holy shit.

1095
02:25:12,209 --> 02:25:14,335
I need a vacation.

1096
02:25:28,268 --> 02:25:29,789
Is it dead?

1097
02:25:30,812 --> 02:25:32,115
Terminated.

1098
02:25:35,622 --> 02:25:37,245
Will this melt in there?

1099
02:25:40,241 --> 02:25:42,083
Yes. Throw it in.

1100
02:25:46,925 --> 02:25:47,925
Adios.

1101
02:25:49,569 --> 02:25:51,173
And the chip.

1102
02:26:06,432 --> 02:26:07,901
It's over.

1103
02:26:10,225 --> 02:26:11,294
No.

1104
02:26:14,761 --> 02:26:16,409
There's one more chip.

1105
02:26:21,236 --> 02:26:23,375
And it must be destroyed also.

1106
02:26:28,879 --> 02:26:30,137
Here.

1107
02:26:30,662 --> 02:26:35,166
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

1108
02:26:42,655 --> 02:26:43,664
No.

1109
02:26:46,762 --> 02:26:49,640
- I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.
- No!

1110
02:26:49,765 --> 02:26:52,892
No, it'll be okay.
Stay with us. It'll be okay.

1111
02:26:53,018 --> 02:26:56,616
I have to go away. No, don't
do it. Please, don't go.

1112
02:26:56,786 --> 02:26:59,016
I must go away, John.
No!

1113
02:26:59,929 --> 02:27:01,329
No, wait.

1114
02:27:01,499 --> 02:27:04,290
Wait. You don't have to do this.
Sorry.

1115
02:27:05,393 --> 02:27:07,384
No, don't do it! Don't go!

1116
02:27:07,808 --> 02:27:09,505
It has to end here.

1117
02:27:10,788 --> 02:27:14,009
I order you not to go.
I order you not to go.

1118
02:27:14,179 --> 02:27:15,917
I order you not to go!

1119
02:27:22,066 --> 02:27:24,019
I know now why you cry.

1120
02:27:26,407 --> 02:27:29,282
But it's something
I can never do.

1121
02:28:03,545 --> 02:28:04,789
Good-bye.

1122
02:29:44,764 --> 02:29:48,773
<i>August 29, 1997, came and went.</i>

1123
02:29:49,407 --> 02:29:53,366
<i>Nothing much happened.
Michael Jackson turned 40.</i>

1124
02:29:53,491 --> 02:29:55,464
<i>There was no Judgment Day.</i>

1125
02:29:56,423 --> 02:29:59,162
<i>People went to work
as they always do.</i>

1126
02:29:59,358 --> 02:30:03,832
<i>Laughed, complained,
watched TV, made love.</i>

1127
02:30:04,920 --> 02:30:07,074
<i>I wanted to run
through the street yelling,</i>

1128
02:30:07,199 --> 02:30:12,253
<i>to grab them all and say,
"Every day from this day on is a gift.</i>

1129
02:30:12,723 --> 02:30:14,272
<i>Use it well."</i>

1130
02:30:14,722 --> 02:30:16,871
<i>Instead, I got drunk.</i>

1131
02:30:17,689 --> 02:30:19,942
<i>That was 30 years ago.</i>

1132
02:30:20,502 --> 02:30:24,414
<i>But the dark future which never came
still exists for me.</i>

1133
02:30:25,274 --> 02:30:28,443
<i>And it always will,
like the traces of a dream.</i>

1134
02:30:31,205 --> 02:30:34,617
<i>John fights the war differently
than it was foretold.</i>

1135
02:30:35,199 --> 02:30:37,659
<i>Here, on the battlefield
of the Senate,</i>

1136
02:30:37,784 --> 02:30:40,245
<i>his weapons are common sense...</i>

1137
02:30:41,087 --> 02:30:42,615
and hope.

1138
02:30:44,293 --> 02:30:46,419
Tie me, Grandma. Tie me!

1139
02:30:54,051 --> 02:30:56,360
- How's that?
- Thank you, Grandma.

1140
02:31:00,404 --> 02:31:02,297
<i>The luxury of hope...</i>

1141
02:31:02,657 --> 02:31:05,104
<i>was given to me
by the Terminator.</i>

1142
02:31:06,674 --> 02:31:10,703
<i>Because if a machine can learn
the value of human life,</i>

1143
02:31:12,200 --> 02:31:14,163
<i>maybe we can too.</i>
