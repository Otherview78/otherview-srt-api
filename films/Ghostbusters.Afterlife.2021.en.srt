2
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:39,887
Ew, Mom, I'm trying
to eat breakfast.

3
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,155
Almost done.

4
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,625
Aw, your mustache
is really coming in.

5
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:46,894
Mom!

6
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:50,831
- Phoebe!
- Ow!

7
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:54,601
I'm bleeding!
You made me bleed!

8
00:05:54,735 --> 00:05:56,970
You'll live. Phoebe!

9
00:05:57,104 --> 00:05:58,437
Oh! What are you doing?

10
00:05:58,572 --> 00:06:00,274
Neighbor's electricity
is running out of phase.

11
00:06:00,406 --> 00:06:02,776
- I tied in, bumped us up to 220.
- Take that off.

12
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,011
Now I can run my lathe.

13
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:06,146
And you didn't think
to ask me?

14
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,849
I mean, you just demonstrate
zero aptitude for science.

15
00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:11,118
- Uh-huh, got it.
- You're better at other things.

16
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:13,419
- Like quesadillas.
- My hair dryer.

17
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:15,489
- Your quesadillas are excellent.
- Thank you.

18
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:16,957
Now what?

19
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,625
Mom!

20
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:21,662
- Really? You don't have legs?
- I'm not an adult.

21
00:06:24,131 --> 00:06:27,568
I'm literally driving
to pick up a check right now.

22
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:28,836
You win lottery?

23
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:30,571
Kind of. My father died.

24
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:32,306
Relax.
I didn't even know him.

25
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:33,740
I'm surprised
he left me anything.

26
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:35,242
- Sounds like my father.
- Yeah?

27
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:36,877
Did your dad
abandon your family

28
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,046
and move to a farm
in the middle of nowhere?

29
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:40,814
No.

30
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:42,549
Look, I...

31
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:46,153
I know I have not been
a reliable or consistent tenant.

32
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:48,488
But if you give me a week
to settle loose ends,

33
00:06:48,622 --> 00:06:50,557
I'll be back
with everything I owe.

34
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,795
I can fix that!

35
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:56,163
Listen,

36
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:58,198
I wait for you to leave,

37
00:06:58,332 --> 00:07:00,399
then I change locks.

38
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:47,547
There it is.
This is Summerville.

39
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:49,415
This is where
your grandfather lived.

40
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:50,617
And died.

41
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:52,920
Ah, come on.
Not a single bar?

42
00:07:53,053 --> 00:07:55,022
There'd better be a bar.

43
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:56,556
That's funny.

44
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:12,639
"Behold,

45
00:08:12,773 --> 00:08:15,275
"there was a great earthquake.

46
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:17,611
"The sun became
as black as cloth,

47
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:19,413
"the seas boiled,

48
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:21,715
"the moon became as blood,

49
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:23,383
"the skies fell.

50
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:24,918
Revelation 6:12."

51
00:08:26,353 --> 00:08:27,988
That was normal.

52
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:30,791
Hey, maybe it's a good thing
you never met your dad.

53
00:08:41,802 --> 00:08:45,072
Great. You didn't tell us
we inherited a murder house.

54
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:49,242
And just think.

55
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:51,411
Now all of this is ours.

56
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:05,792
Pheebs, be a dear and break
into your grandfather's house.

57
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:29,149
Nice.

58
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:35,055
Oh, boy.

59
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,962
Not a single photo.

60
00:09:58,211 --> 00:09:59,179
Rats.

61
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:05,520
You gotta see the gold mine
of junk I found out back.

62
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:06,720
Great.

63
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:09,856
Oh, my God,
this is so much worse

64
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,758
than I thought it was gonna be.

65
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:25,906
Under the dining table now!

66
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:29,576
Phoebe.

67
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:33,613
Remember that summer
we died under a table?

68
00:10:33,747 --> 00:10:35,882
Of course this place is built
on a fault line.

69
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:37,217
Probably just fracking.

70
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,186
It's fracking annoying,
is what it is.

71
00:10:40,654 --> 00:10:42,789
It's okay,
we're only here for a week.

72
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,293
Um, give or take.

73
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:50,097
What does that mean?

74
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,401
It means we're staying.

75
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:56,436
You said we'd
only be here for a week!

76
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:59,206
Yeah, well, that was
before we got evicted.

77
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:00,807
You said
you had money saved up.

78
00:11:00,941 --> 00:11:04,044
- That was before I had children.
- Oh!

79
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:06,313
To be fair, you've never
been good with money.

80
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:07,814
Thanks, Pheebs.

81
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:13,954
What's that?

82
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:15,322
How am I supposed to know?

83
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:21,161
Can I help you?

84
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:30,971
Um, hi. We're...
We're the, um... The...

85
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:32,672
This was my father's place.

86
00:11:36,443 --> 00:11:38,078
Hi.

87
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:39,279
Hi.

88
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:43,950
I'm, uh, Janine Melnitz.
We spoke on the phone.

89
00:11:44,084 --> 00:11:45,352
I was your father's...

90
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:47,687
You know, we were friends.

91
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:49,524
- Very sorry for your loss.
- It's okay.

92
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:52,325
You knew him better than me.
I should be sorry for your loss.

93
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:54,495
I just tried to keep
the bills paid on time,

94
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:56,497
- that kind of thing.
- Like a money manager?

95
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:58,832
Oh, there was
no money to manage.

96
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:01,001
He could barely keep
the power on.

97
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:04,037
So he left us nothing?

98
00:12:04,171 --> 00:12:07,841
Well, I wouldn't say that.

99
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:10,076
There is quite a bit of debt.

100
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,215
Ms. Melnitz,
I'm here to sign forms,

101
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:18,385
pack the silverware
and leave with a rent check.

102
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,987
Are you telling me
this place is worthless?

103
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:23,658
You mean, aside from
the sentimental value?

104
00:12:37,704 --> 00:12:39,239
Are you going
to that thing later?

105
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:41,509
- Yeah, probably.
- Where's my order?

106
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,412
I can't believe
a place like this still exists.

107
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:48,315
I can't believe we have
to spend a summer in this heap.

108
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:50,651
- We have lives.
- You don't think I have a life?

109
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:52,385
No. You're a mom.
You live for us.

110
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,033
I'll be right back.

111
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,971
Oh.

112
00:13:14,908 --> 00:13:18,378
Hey. Maybe you will make
a friend out here.

113
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:20,747
- Make them out of what?
- I'm serious.

114
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,251
A new home could be
an opportunity to start fresh.

115
00:13:24,384 --> 00:13:25,819
Just keep an open mind.

116
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:42,570
Two taters, three Spinners,
grilled onions, one no cheese.

117
00:13:42,703 --> 00:13:44,971
Lucky, there's... There's
something wrong with the meat.

118
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:47,407
- I don't feel so good, Lucky. Oh!
- There's something wrong.

119
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,776
- He's throwing up the meat!
- Heh-heh-heh!

120
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:51,077
Cool place.

121
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,481
Yeah, I'll use that.

122
00:13:54,781 --> 00:13:55,882
I don't own it.

123
00:13:56,016 --> 00:13:57,718
I know you don't own it.

124
00:13:57,851 --> 00:13:59,720
You look pretty young
to own a business.

125
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:05,493
I saw the sign out front.
"Help wanted"?

126
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:08,596
I... I can be helpful.

127
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:13,967
Under experience, you put
"friendly" with a smiley face?

128
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,603
I didn't really know
what to put.

129
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:18,371
I don't think "friendly"
qualifies as an experience.

130
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:20,340
It's a quality, I guess.

131
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:26,480
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

132
00:14:26,614 --> 00:14:28,948
Think you can put in
a good word for me?

133
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:30,718
I can tell them
you have a pulse.

134
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,985
My name's Trevor.

135
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:34,522
My name's Trevor.

136
00:14:34,655 --> 00:14:36,956
- Dude, that was great.
- Dude, that was really cute.

137
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,727
You have a chance with her.
You really do.

138
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:42,496
Mmm.

139
00:14:43,597 --> 00:14:44,799
So where you heading?

140
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:46,433
We're staying, actually.

141
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:49,269
You know that farmhouse
off the highway with the barn?

142
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:51,271
Dirt? It was my father's.

143
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:54,040
Dirt Farmer had a family?

144
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:56,142
You knew my father?

145
00:14:56,276 --> 00:14:58,646
No one knew your father.

146
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:00,681
Well, I'm sure he'll be missed.

147
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:02,282
Nope.

148
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,191
Whoa!

149
00:15:12,593 --> 00:15:13,860
What's up, Casanova?

150
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,786
Ow.

151
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:56,897
Damn it.

152
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:06,973
What?

153
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:10,611
Come on! Bus leaves in 15!

154
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:25,826
Hey, Pheebs, at school today,

155
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,061
don't be afraid
to just start a conversation.

156
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:29,996
Are you kidding?
That's horrible advice.

157
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:32,165
You're literally setting her up
for failure.

158
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:35,201
Hey, how are the jokes
coming along?

159
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:37,370
Why should you
never trust atoms?

160
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:41,074
Because they
make up everything.

161
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:44,645
- That's funny.
- No, it's not.

162
00:17:44,778 --> 00:17:47,013
- You can drop me off here.
- Are you embarrassed?

163
00:17:47,146 --> 00:17:48,549
Yeah. Bye.

164
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,221
Love you!

165
00:17:58,358 --> 00:18:01,027
- That almost killed you.
- Yeah, with your face.

166
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,163
- What's wrong? You love school.
- I love learning.

167
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:06,967
This is a state-sponsored
work camp for delinquents.

168
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,471
Fine. You can help me scrape
asbestos out of the attic.

169
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:14,307
I'll take my chances
with public education.

170
00:18:15,843 --> 00:18:17,511
Hey, don't be yourself.

171
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,685
- You okay?
- Ah, yeah. First day.

172
00:18:24,818 --> 00:18:27,053
Can you imagine who they've got
teaching summer school?

173
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:29,188
I can. I teach here.

174
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:30,791
Oh, I'm so sorry.

175
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:33,092
No, it's okay. It's...

176
00:18:33,226 --> 00:18:36,030
Most of the kids that go here,
they're not very bright.

177
00:18:36,162 --> 00:18:37,463
Hey, Colin.

178
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:40,534
He's...

179
00:18:40,668 --> 00:18:42,703
I can kind of do
whatever I want.

180
00:18:42,836 --> 00:18:43,971
Score.

181
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:44,972
- Right?
- Mm.

182
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:46,472
- Dream job.
- Mm-hm.

183
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:53,714
Good morning, class.
How's everybody doing today?

184
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:55,916
My name's Mr. Grooberson.

185
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,518
Um...

186
00:18:57,651 --> 00:18:58,786
I know.

187
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,054
You don't wanna be here.

188
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:01,522
I don't wanna be here either.

189
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:03,791
Now, apparently,

190
00:19:03,924 --> 00:19:06,894
your, uh, school is
still operating on VHS,

191
00:19:07,027 --> 00:19:10,598
but, um, I found this gem
in the teachers' lounge.

192
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:12,131
It's great. It's called <i>Cujo.</i>

193
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:14,902
It's about
a rabid Saint Bernard that...

194
00:19:15,035 --> 00:19:17,303
You know what? I don't
wanna give too much away.

195
00:19:17,437 --> 00:19:20,074
But imagine Beethoven
if he contracted rabies

196
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:22,375
and just started
mauling children.

197
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:24,410
You'll get an idea.

198
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:25,779
Enjoy.

199
00:19:30,884 --> 00:19:34,688
Speeding. Three, two, one.

200
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:37,958
She sits alone.

201
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:41,427
An outcast,
rejected by her peers.

202
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:43,030
But what is her secret?

203
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:45,599
Perhaps she's on the run.

204
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:48,802
On the run...

205
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:50,771
from herself.

206
00:19:50,904 --> 00:19:52,539
And go.

207
00:19:54,008 --> 00:19:55,976
Actually,
my grandfather died.

208
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,812
My mom says we're here to pick
through the rubble of his life.

209
00:19:58,946 --> 00:20:02,983
So you're here to uncover
the mystery of his death?

210
00:20:03,117 --> 00:20:04,283
No.

211
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:05,919
It was natural causes.

212
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:10,124
Are you sure
it wasn't unnatural causes?

213
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:11,692
Yes.

214
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:14,028
Pretty sure
it was just a heart attack.

215
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,930
Oh, the silent killer.

216
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:20,701
I'm Phoebe.

217
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,335
Oh, cool. Uh, I'm Podcast.

218
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:24,337
Why do people call you Podcast?

219
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,473
Oh, I call myself Podcast.
Because of my podcast.

220
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:34,481
- Doing some painting?
- Mm, yeah.

221
00:20:34,615 --> 00:20:35,883
Whereabouts you staying?

222
00:20:36,016 --> 00:20:39,053
Um, that old apocalyptic ranch
off of 99.

223
00:20:39,185 --> 00:20:40,821
It was my father's place.

224
00:20:40,954 --> 00:20:43,057
Dirt Farmer had a family?

225
00:20:43,189 --> 00:20:44,858
You all called him
the Dirt Farmer?

226
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:46,827
Meant nothing by it.

227
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,764
Man spends every week
working a piece of land...

228
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:53,167
but never seeding,
never watering,

229
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:55,334
never growing
a ding-dang thing.

230
00:20:55,468 --> 00:20:56,937
It's curious behavior.

231
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:59,573
Great customer though.

232
00:20:59,707 --> 00:21:02,076
He... He bought
some bizarre shit.

233
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,712
Yeah, that sounds like him.

234
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:29,703
What is this?

235
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:33,073
Hello.

236
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:35,943
Um, you know, there's
a highly entertaining movie

237
00:21:36,076 --> 00:21:38,244
about a killer dog
happening right over there.

238
00:21:38,377 --> 00:21:41,715
- Is this a seismic map?
- Yes.

239
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:44,417
- How did you know that?
- It's a map of seismic activity.

240
00:21:44,551 --> 00:21:46,620
- Right. But...
- You're a seismologist?

241
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:50,557
Does that seem
so hard to believe?

242
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:52,826
Figured you
for a football coach.

243
00:21:53,894 --> 00:21:55,796
Oh.

244
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:57,898
Um, thank you.

245
00:21:58,031 --> 00:22:00,701
These don't look
tectonic or volcanic.

246
00:22:02,268 --> 00:22:03,971
Okay, smarty.

247
00:22:04,104 --> 00:22:05,739
Here, check this out.

248
00:22:05,873 --> 00:22:08,441
This is a volcano, all right?

249
00:22:08,575 --> 00:22:12,311
It builds and crests.

250
00:22:12,445 --> 00:22:15,249
But this is
a tectonic earthquake.

251
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:18,919
Notice a little P-wave
followed by a large S wave.

252
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:24,158
Yeah, I'm not an idiot.

253
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:28,461
Clearly. Well, this is
the pattern in Summerville.

254
00:22:28,595 --> 00:22:33,100
Large P-wave, small S wave.
Like an explosion.

255
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:35,836
- Where is it coming from?
- I don't know. I don't know.

256
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:38,539
I set up geophones,
but I can't triangulate.

257
00:22:38,672 --> 00:22:40,874
- Are you using three?
- Yeah.

258
00:22:41,008 --> 00:22:43,177
I know how many sides
there are in a triangle.

259
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:45,879
I just thought
you were being obtuse.

260
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,118
Was that a geometry joke?

261
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:54,054
- Yes, that's why I winked.
- Ah.

262
00:22:54,188 --> 00:22:56,056
Uh, that's terrible.

263
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,558
No, I loved it.

264
00:22:57,691 --> 00:23:00,060
Look at this.
I mean, somehow,

265
00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:02,563
a town that isn't anywhere
near a tectonic plate,

266
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:05,999
that has no underground volcanic
activity, no fault lines,

267
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:08,202
no fracking,
no loud music even,

268
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:10,037
is shaking
on a daily basis.

269
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:14,141
Maybe it's the apocalypse.

270
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,650
Twenty-three, 24, 25.

271
00:23:23,784 --> 00:23:27,020
Hey, no-skills. How's inventory?

272
00:23:27,154 --> 00:23:29,156
Oh, hey, how's it going?
No, it's not good.

273
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:30,557
It's not good at all. Um...

274
00:23:30,691 --> 00:23:33,026
- Does everyone do this?
- Yeah, it's important.

275
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,595
You okay?

276
00:23:34,728 --> 00:23:36,395
Your lips are literally blue.

277
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,764
Yeah, I'm fine.

278
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:39,199
You should borrow my hoodie.

279
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,901
No, it's fine. Seriously.

280
00:23:41,034 --> 00:23:42,336
It's really masculine.

281
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:44,738
It's got a wolf on it.
Trust me.

282
00:23:44,872 --> 00:23:46,106
Okay.

283
00:23:50,711 --> 00:23:52,546
I'm kind of surprised
it fits me.

284
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,413
Yeah, it's my boyfriend's,
actually.

285
00:23:54,548 --> 00:23:56,683
- Oh.
- Back to inventory.

286
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:02,122
Okay, we're speeding.
Three, two, one.

287
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:03,757
Uh, yeah,
just introduce yourself

288
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:05,926
and tell me
what you ate for breakfast.

289
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,028
Um, Phoebe.

290
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:09,963
Toast.

291
00:24:10,097 --> 00:24:14,201
Okay, um, maybe a little more.
Tell me a joke or something.

292
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:16,570
- A joke?
- Mm-hm.

293
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:20,941
What do you call
a dead polar bear?

294
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:24,845
Anything you want.

295
00:24:24,978 --> 00:24:26,580
It can't hear you now.

296
00:24:31,985 --> 00:24:34,288
Wow. That was funny.

297
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,924
- You're funny.
- It's a pretty hilarious joke.

298
00:24:37,057 --> 00:24:38,892
Fun fact:
Did you know Summerville

299
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:40,961
has more dead residents
than living ones?

300
00:24:41,094 --> 00:24:43,497
Yeah, that's
how cemeteries work.

301
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,166
Wertheimers Hardware,
run by the Illuminati.

302
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,068
- Lizard people.
- Lizard people?

303
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:50,003
Jefferson, Einstein, Beyoncé?

304
00:24:50,137 --> 00:24:52,105
How do you think
we got the pyramids?

305
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:54,007
- Slaves?
- Movie theater.

306
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:55,409
That one's haunted.

307
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,311
I don't believe in ghosts.

308
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:01,348
What? How can you...?

309
00:25:01,481 --> 00:25:04,685
I mean, all the evidence!
You don't believe in spirits?

310
00:25:04,818 --> 00:25:06,520
No.

311
00:25:06,653 --> 00:25:09,790
I think we're all
just kind of meat puppets.

312
00:25:11,391 --> 00:25:12,960
There's something
you need to see.

313
00:25:13,093 --> 00:25:14,294
I'll grab my wheels.

314
00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:24,504
Are we even allowed to be here?

315
00:25:24,638 --> 00:25:26,406
Oh, yeah. Totally.

316
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,275
The mine's been closed
since the '40s.

317
00:25:28,408 --> 00:25:29,943
They just put
all these signs up

318
00:25:30,077 --> 00:25:32,112
'cause of
hazardous chemical leaks

319
00:25:32,245 --> 00:25:34,114
and on account of dynamite.

320
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:37,417
I do this. Hmm.

321
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,293
The whole town was basically
a mining operation.

322
00:25:46,426 --> 00:25:48,495
They bore out this mountain
like a grapefruit

323
00:25:48,628 --> 00:25:52,165
and smelted everything into
cold-riveted selenium girders.

324
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:53,834
Why would you
make a steel beam

325
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:56,403
out of an electro conductor
like selenium?

326
00:25:57,838 --> 00:25:58,905
Right?

327
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,407
Weird.

328
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,809
Until one day,

329
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:05,312
they were forced to close down
the whole enchilada.

330
00:26:05,445 --> 00:26:06,546
Why?

331
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:11,451
One by one,
miners who had worked for years

332
00:26:11,585 --> 00:26:15,389
began leaping down
the mine shaft to their death.

333
00:26:15,522 --> 00:26:17,190
They called it...

334
00:26:17,324 --> 00:26:19,993
the Shandorian curse.

335
00:26:42,382 --> 00:26:43,717
Who built these?

336
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,352
Depends who you believe.

337
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:48,088
One day, they just showed up
without explanation.

338
00:26:51,158 --> 00:26:52,527
Cool.

339
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,523
What a shitbox.

340
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:26,893
So, what's
your podcast about?

341
00:27:27,027 --> 00:27:29,729
Oh, um, mostly mysteries
and the unknown,

342
00:27:29,863 --> 00:27:31,298
uh, conspiracy theories,

343
00:27:31,431 --> 00:27:33,433
the occasional
restaurant review.

344
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,303
Well, maybe I could
check it out sometime.

345
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:38,605
- Really?
- Yeah.

346
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:47,414
The show really finds
its voice on Episode 46.

347
00:27:47,548 --> 00:27:49,082
Okay.

348
00:27:49,216 --> 00:27:50,617
Uh, hey.

349
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,120
Look, this is totally cool
if this is a no.

350
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:54,688
Uh, zero "presh."

351
00:27:54,821 --> 00:27:57,525
Uh, but, um...

352
00:27:57,657 --> 00:27:59,594
do you wanna
be my lab partner?

353
00:28:01,328 --> 00:28:04,532
Well, I don't think
we're gonna be doing any labs,

354
00:28:04,664 --> 00:28:06,199
but yeah.

355
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:07,934
Yeah, sure, I'd love to.

356
00:28:08,068 --> 00:28:10,170
Cool, cool. All right.

357
00:28:11,404 --> 00:28:12,672
Yeah.

358
00:28:14,141 --> 00:28:16,409
Well, this is me.

359
00:28:16,544 --> 00:28:18,145
The Dirt Farmer's house?

360
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:21,815
- Yeah, he was my grandfather.
- No way, dude!

361
00:28:21,948 --> 00:28:24,451
So you're just gonna walk in?

362
00:28:26,554 --> 00:28:29,022
- Are you recording me?
- Yeah, just in case

363
00:28:29,156 --> 00:28:31,024
your body's pulled apart
into tiny pieces

364
00:28:31,158 --> 00:28:33,260
by an unseen dark force.

365
00:28:35,596 --> 00:28:37,931
All right. Bye.

366
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:14,100
Okay, so this is happening.

367
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:40,093
Hello?

368
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:56,229
<i>No!</i>

369
00:31:58,898 --> 00:32:01,101
<i>Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?</i>

370
00:32:06,873 --> 00:32:09,442
I need to know
what's lurking inside.

371
00:32:09,577 --> 00:32:12,912
- No way. Killer replica.
- Totally.

372
00:32:13,046 --> 00:32:15,583
- A replica of what?
- A trap.

373
00:32:17,384 --> 00:32:18,351
A ghost trap.

374
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:24,257
Seriously? How do you of
all people not know about this?

375
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:27,327
- I'm ashamed.
- Oh, I was obsessed.

376
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,831
New York in the '80s,
it was like <i>The Walking Dead.</i>

377
00:32:30,964 --> 00:32:32,600
- Then it just stopped?
- Mm-hm.

378
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:35,503
I mean, there hasn't been
a ghost sighting in 30 years.

379
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,381
Wait a minute.

380
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:51,451
This thing is real?

381
00:32:51,585 --> 00:32:53,019
- Absolutely.
- Maybe.

382
00:32:54,254 --> 00:32:55,823
I found it
in my living room.

383
00:32:55,955 --> 00:32:57,658
She lives on the Dirt Farm.

384
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:59,392
Oh, the really spooky one?

385
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:01,094
Yeah, the one
that says "dirt" on it.

386
00:33:02,696 --> 00:33:04,799
What happened in New York?

387
00:33:04,931 --> 00:33:07,300
The whole city was freaking out.

388
00:33:07,434 --> 00:33:08,935
Then these physicists showed up

389
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:10,771
with these portable
proton accelerators

390
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,807
and blew the roof off
of a Manhattan high-rise.

391
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,580
None of this rings a bell?

392
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:21,582
It happened 20 years
before we were born.

393
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:23,116
I believe it.

394
00:33:23,249 --> 00:33:24,685
Ghostbusters!

395
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:26,620
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

396
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:32,726
I mean, your, uh, dad
never mentioned this?

397
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,127
It's just my mom.

398
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,396
Oh, just your mom. Oh.

399
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:39,165
Um, cool.

400
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:41,000
"Cool"?

401
00:33:41,134 --> 00:33:43,169
I wonder if this still works.

402
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:46,239
Should we open it?

403
00:33:56,449 --> 00:33:57,685
Glasses.

404
00:33:57,818 --> 00:34:00,320
Two millimeters
of plastic eye protection?

405
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:01,689
Are you sure this is safe?

406
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:02,857
Safe?

407
00:34:02,989 --> 00:34:04,892
Heh, no.

408
00:34:05,024 --> 00:34:06,059
No.

409
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:07,695
History is safe.

410
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:09,697
Geometry, that's safe.

411
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,032
Science is all

412
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:15,836
particle accelerators
and hydrogen bombs.

413
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,738
Science is giving yourself
the plague

414
00:34:17,872 --> 00:34:19,673
and gambling on the cure.

415
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,140
Science is reckless.

416
00:34:21,274 --> 00:34:23,677
Totally! Yes!
It's punk rock.

417
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,079
It's a safety pin
through the nipple of academia.

418
00:34:26,212 --> 00:34:29,449
- Ouch.
- Fire it up.

419
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,125
I've always wanted
to do this.

420
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:35,114
Yes!

421
00:35:35,248 --> 00:35:37,116
Uh...

422
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,218
we should probably
get out of here.

423
00:35:39,352 --> 00:35:40,888
You're an adult.

424
00:35:41,021 --> 00:35:41,956
Yeah.

425
00:35:43,023 --> 00:35:44,290
And liable.

426
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:48,227
You know what this means,
right?

427
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:51,130
Your grandfather
was a Ghostbuster.

428
00:35:51,264 --> 00:35:52,967
Yes, I'm aware.

429
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:19,026
It has a door and windows,

430
00:36:19,158 --> 00:36:21,127
like any ordinary house.

431
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,930
But the distinct smell
of evil...

432
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,700
...is prominent.

433
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:28,035
What are you doing?

434
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:30,604
Oh, um,
giving a little color.

435
00:36:30,738 --> 00:36:32,106
Setting the mood.

436
00:36:32,238 --> 00:36:34,140
It's creepy.
I dig it.

437
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,980
Wow.

438
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,447
Cool.

439
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:46,285
Whoa. Aztec death whistle.

440
00:36:46,419 --> 00:36:48,421
It's designed
to ward off evil spirits.

441
00:36:48,555 --> 00:36:50,289
It's got
a really horrifying sound...

442
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,194
What...?

443
00:36:57,263 --> 00:36:59,165
Um, what the hell is that?

444
00:36:59,298 --> 00:37:01,200
Aztec death whistle.
Can I keep it?

445
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:03,604
Yes, please.
Just don't do that again.

446
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,473
Hi.

447
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:08,742
Hello again.

448
00:37:10,376 --> 00:37:12,345
You brought them home.

449
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:15,916
- It's a service I provide.
- Are...?

450
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,652
- Well, I'm also an escort.
- Mmm...?

451
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:20,854
- That came out wrong.
- Kind of... Yep.

452
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,656
The truth is,
I've always wondered

453
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,559
what lurked
inside this haunt box.

454
00:37:25,693 --> 00:37:28,062
Right. Well, the only thing
lurking inside here

455
00:37:28,194 --> 00:37:29,897
is my slowly dying soul.

456
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,565
Is that what that smell is?

457
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:34,267
Well, it's not dinner, so...

458
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,803
Well, all right.

459
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:41,075
- Um, would you...
- Sure.

460
00:37:41,207 --> 00:37:43,043
- ...like...?
- Yeah.

461
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,712
I don't have any food.

462
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:45,979
- It's fine.
- Okay, tour.

463
00:37:46,113 --> 00:37:47,346
- Great.
- Great.

464
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:50,584
Here's the dining room.

465
00:37:54,788 --> 00:37:57,323
I think Grooberson's trying
to bone your mom.

466
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,327
Oh.

467
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:04,198
That doesn't bother you?

468
00:38:04,363 --> 00:38:06,066
No, of course it bothers me.

469
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,603
I just don't exhibit emotions
the same way everyone else does.

470
00:38:09,737 --> 00:38:11,872
Inside, I'm vomiting.

471
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,410
Wait.

472
00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:20,446
Isn't this
what we saw earlier?

473
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,890
"The Sumerians believed
in a land of the dead,

474
00:38:30,023 --> 00:38:34,795
"a dark and shadowy realm
within the bowels of the earth.

475
00:38:34,928 --> 00:38:39,967
<i>"The souls of the dead are
ruled by a mighty god, Gozer,</i>

476
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,469
"and protected
by a powerful Gatekeeper

477
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:46,940
"and Keymaster, in order
that Gozer might rise up

478
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,275
"and walk the human plane again.

479
00:38:49,408 --> 00:38:53,714
The Gatekeeper and Keymaster
must assume the form of beasts."

480
00:38:56,449 --> 00:38:57,818
What did we let out?

481
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:03,322
Yum.

482
00:39:03,456 --> 00:39:05,159
Has this ever
been cleaned before?

483
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:06,627
Not by me.

484
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,862
We're heading up the mountain.

485
00:39:10,697 --> 00:39:11,632
You coming?

486
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,475
Rivers are like
the moms of canyons.

487
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,712
Basically,
when you think about it.

488
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,068
Why'd you bring me up here?

489
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,771
Entertainment value.

490
00:40:24,905 --> 00:40:26,773
Can you juggle?

491
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:33,347
- It's not funny.
- What are you doing here

492
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,915
in Summerville anyway?

493
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:40,687
Honestly, my mom won't say it,
but we're broke.

494
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:43,557
We got evicted, and the only
thing that's left in our name

495
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,592
is this creepy, old farmhouse
our grandfather left us

496
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:47,895
in the middle of nowhere.

497
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,930
No offense.

498
00:40:50,063 --> 00:40:52,065
I'm not offended.

499
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,034
This place is a dump.

500
00:40:56,402 --> 00:40:57,704
Then why do you live here?

501
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:00,574
I'm fourth-generation dump,
so...

502
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:01,742
Oh.

503
00:41:04,544 --> 00:41:06,246
You think you'll ever leave?

504
00:41:08,515 --> 00:41:12,252
I mean, if I don't,
what does that say about me?

505
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,922
You don't have a car.

506
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:17,991
What the hell? Get out.

507
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,332
What is that?

508
00:41:25,464 --> 00:41:26,333
I don't know.

509
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:30,971
<i>Gozer.</i>

510
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:41,615
What was that?

511
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:50,090
It's not funny.

512
00:41:52,192 --> 00:41:54,161
What is this?

513
00:41:54,294 --> 00:41:57,431
- That's a map.
- Yeah, I know it's a...

514
00:41:57,597 --> 00:42:00,067
A map. But this...

515
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,136
This thing's ancient. It's
written in a kind of cuneiform.

516
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,439
Oh, yeah?

517
00:42:05,572 --> 00:42:07,341
This is Summerville.

518
00:42:07,473 --> 00:42:09,509
- That doesn't make sense.
- No, not at all.

519
00:42:09,643 --> 00:42:12,346
Summerville's not even 100
years old, but this is written

520
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:14,114
in a language
from thousands of years ago.

521
00:42:14,247 --> 00:42:16,683
For all I know,
that's the language he spoke.

522
00:42:17,784 --> 00:42:19,619
That's it?

523
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:21,355
You don't think
this is incredible

524
00:42:21,488 --> 00:42:23,523
and bizarre and fascinating?

525
00:42:25,826 --> 00:42:26,793
Can I have this?

526
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:28,495
Yeah, sure. Weirdo.

527
00:42:28,628 --> 00:42:30,964
That's how it starts.
First there's a map.

528
00:42:31,098 --> 00:42:32,666
Then you move
into a haunted house.

529
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:35,802
Then everyone's calling you
the Dirt Farmer.

530
00:42:35,936 --> 00:42:38,171
What about Phoebe?
Think she'd want any of this?

531
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,541
Oh, I'm sure
Phoebe will find something.

532
00:43:31,158 --> 00:43:32,292
Hello?

533
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:31,144
Two of the CRT emitters
are missing.

534
00:45:38,285 --> 00:45:39,487
Thanks.

535
00:45:55,536 --> 00:45:58,705
How on earth did you build
such a small cyclotron?

536
00:46:00,874 --> 00:46:03,476
Got it. You're a genius.

537
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,082
Needle-nose pliers?

538
00:46:18,158 --> 00:46:21,094
<i>Are you troubled by
strange noises in the night?</i>

539
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:22,862
<i>Do you experience
feelings of dread</i>

540
00:46:22,996 --> 00:46:24,264
<i>in your basement or attic?</i>

541
00:46:24,397 --> 00:46:25,899
<i>Have you or any of your family</i>

542
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:27,635
<i>ever seen a spook, specter
or ghost?</i>

543
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:28,902
<i>If the answer is yes,</i>

544
00:46:29,035 --> 00:46:30,538
<i>don't wait another minute.</i>

545
00:46:30,671 --> 00:46:32,906
- <i>Call the professionals.</i>
- <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

546
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:35,809
<i>Our courteous and efficient
staff is on call 24 hours a day</i>

547
00:46:35,942 --> 00:46:38,245

00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,946
<i>We're ready to believe you.</i>

549
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,982
Hey, you're awake.

550
00:46:42,115 --> 00:46:44,217
What are you up to?

551
00:46:44,351 --> 00:46:45,553
Experiments.

552
00:46:45,686 --> 00:46:47,655
Ugh, lame.

553
00:46:47,787 --> 00:46:49,990
Oh, you found popcorn.

554
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,460
What kind of scientist
was Grandpa?

555
00:46:53,594 --> 00:46:55,663
The kind
that repels loved ones.

556
00:46:57,097 --> 00:46:59,833
- Maybe a physicist?
- Sure.

557
00:46:59,966 --> 00:47:03,604
So tomorrow I was thinking
of grabbing dinner with Gary.

558
00:47:05,272 --> 00:47:06,139
Who's Gary?

559
00:47:06,273 --> 00:47:07,907
Mr. Grooberson.

560
00:47:09,009 --> 00:47:11,646
His name is Gary Grooberson?

561
00:47:11,778 --> 00:47:13,780
You have a date
with Gary Grooberson.

562
00:47:13,913 --> 00:47:15,215
It's just dinner.

563
00:47:15,348 --> 00:47:16,883
Good night, Phoebe.

564
00:47:18,552 --> 00:47:19,754
Don't be yourself.

565
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:49,816
Welcome to Rust City.

566
00:47:49,949 --> 00:47:52,620
This is where they processed
all the raw selenium?

567
00:47:52,753 --> 00:47:53,853
Yeah, I guess.

568
00:48:00,293 --> 00:48:01,361
Cool.

569
00:48:02,763 --> 00:48:04,130
How'd you
know how to fix it?

570
00:48:04,264 --> 00:48:06,299
I mean, no offense,
but you are 12.

571
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:09,503
I kind of met
my grandfather last night.

572
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,706
He showed me what to do.

573
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:15,108
No way. Was he, like,
howling and clanking chains?

574
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:18,144
- No. That would've been weird.
- Oh.

575
00:48:18,278 --> 00:48:19,446
Switch me on.

576
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,664
Safety's off.

577
00:49:12,031 --> 00:49:13,433
Her feet are planted.

578
00:49:13,567 --> 00:49:15,168
Her face is poised.

579
00:49:15,301 --> 00:49:17,170
Will this be
the moment of her death?

580
00:49:17,303 --> 00:49:19,105
Nobody knows.

581
00:49:26,747 --> 00:49:28,181
Yeah!

582
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:30,551
Whoo!

583
00:49:35,455 --> 00:49:38,559
Oh, my gosh.

584
00:49:38,692 --> 00:49:40,761
That is the best thing
I've ever seen.

585
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:47,902
Did I hit it?

586
00:49:49,804 --> 00:49:52,172
You didn't hit it.
You destroyed it!

587
00:49:52,305 --> 00:49:55,308
It doesn't even exist anymore!

588
00:49:55,442 --> 00:49:56,677
My turn.

589
00:50:01,981 --> 00:50:03,751
What was that?

590
00:50:03,884 --> 00:50:06,453
Probably a pigeon or something.
Give me the gun.

591
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:11,926
What is that?

592
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:14,929
Come on.

593
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:18,431
Hold on.

594
00:50:20,266 --> 00:50:22,603
- You coming?
- I'm coming.

595
00:50:46,259 --> 00:50:48,796
I gotta come back here
for my Halloween episode.

596
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:45,586
It's a ghost.

597
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,290
A-aren't you just a little bit
freaked out right now?

598
00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:52,760
Overstimulation calms me.

599
00:52:18,819 --> 00:52:21,889
- Okay, okay, okay.
- What's that for?

600
00:52:22,022 --> 00:52:23,023
I have a plan.

601
00:52:23,156 --> 00:52:24,792
Wait!

602
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:51,417
- Get the trap!
- Okay.

603
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,867
I got him!

604
00:53:07,001 --> 00:53:08,167
Quick!

605
00:53:09,637 --> 00:53:12,106
- Nuggets! Aah!
- Catch him!

606
00:53:38,264 --> 00:53:39,700
Okay.

607
00:53:43,202 --> 00:53:45,139
Ugh, come on!

608
00:53:48,542 --> 00:53:50,577
Come on, you can do this.

609
00:53:54,347 --> 00:53:55,582
Come on, darling.

610
00:54:02,388 --> 00:54:03,322
Yes!

611
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,371
Yes!

612
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:38,759
Shit!

613
00:54:55,075 --> 00:54:55,976
Hey.

614
00:54:58,212 --> 00:54:59,213
Hey.

615
00:55:00,279 --> 00:55:02,381
This is Podcast.

616
00:55:02,516 --> 00:55:03,951
He... He's my friend.

617
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:06,252
- You have a friend?
- You have a car?

618
00:55:07,286 --> 00:55:08,321
Yeah, it's a Cadillac.

619
00:55:08,454 --> 00:55:10,323
Hey, dude. We need a ride.

620
00:55:10,456 --> 00:55:12,626
- Do you know how to drive?
- He doesn't.

621
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,229
He failed his driver's test
three times.

622
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:16,563
Get in the back.

623
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,704
- Thank you.
- It sounds crazy,

624
00:55:23,837 --> 00:55:26,305
but Oklahoma never had
earthquakes. For centuries.

625
00:55:26,439 --> 00:55:29,877
But then, between 2010 and 2016,
they had like a thousand.

626
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:31,145
Oh, jeez, what happened?

627
00:55:31,277 --> 00:55:33,714
Oil and gas,
that's what happened.

628
00:55:33,847 --> 00:55:36,083
Yeah, they started pumping
millions of gallons

629
00:55:36,216 --> 00:55:39,285
of salinated water deep
into the Arbuckle Formation.

630
00:55:39,418 --> 00:55:41,121
And then
the porous limestone...

631
00:55:43,957 --> 00:55:45,993
Are you drunk?
Or are you just really bored?

632
00:55:46,126 --> 00:55:48,262
Because I think
I can see you falling asleep.

633
00:55:48,394 --> 00:55:51,297
Uh, I just have, uh,
an allergy to science.

634
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:53,634
Uh-huh.
Have you tried Benadryl?

635
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,136
- I've tried, um, whiskey.
- It's better than Benadryl.

636
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:59,372
But science is amazing.
Science is pure.

637
00:55:59,506 --> 00:56:01,474
It's an absolute.

638
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,677
I mean, it's an answer
to all the madness.

639
00:56:04,912 --> 00:56:06,312
Why don't you like science?

640
00:56:06,445 --> 00:56:09,616
Was, uh... Was Phoebe's dad
a scientist, or...?

641
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,819
- Oh, gross. No.
- No?

642
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,787
I'm making an assumption.

643
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:17,491
What's his deal?

644
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,458
Honestly, I don't...
It doesn't matter.

645
00:56:19,593 --> 00:56:23,096
He was fine with Trevor, but
with Phoebe, he just really...

646
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:25,265
He couldn't connect
with her, so...

647
00:56:25,398 --> 00:56:28,602
Right. Well, he sounds
like a royal dirtbag.

648
00:56:28,735 --> 00:56:30,938
Oh, no, he was actually
just a very ordinary dirtbag.

649
00:56:31,071 --> 00:56:35,374
Well, hey, at least, uh,
Phoebe turned out okay, right?

650
00:56:35,509 --> 00:56:37,110
I hope so.

651
00:56:37,244 --> 00:56:38,512
I don't know.

652
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,714
She really keeps me
on the outside.

653
00:56:40,848 --> 00:56:44,985
She's just an awkward,
nerdy kid, but she's awesome.

654
00:56:45,118 --> 00:56:47,020
I think she's great.

655
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:49,355
I think you're great.
You're a great mom.

656
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,158
Yeah. You showed up. You win.

657
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:53,994
I just wish she'd relax,
you know?

658
00:56:54,127 --> 00:56:57,264
- Just get into some trouble.
- There's plenty of time for that.

659
00:56:57,396 --> 00:56:59,032
Maybe she'll take up
pole dancing.

660
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:02,812
- She's not very coordinated.
- Oh, I don't think that matters.

661
00:57:38,976 --> 00:57:40,744
So, what the hell is going on?

662
00:57:40,878 --> 00:57:43,180
In the 1980s,
New York City was attacked.

663
00:57:43,313 --> 00:57:45,414
I know
the Manhattan ghost stories.

664
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:47,885
- The stories are real.
- Yeah, and so were the guys

665
00:57:48,018 --> 00:57:49,987
who climbed a building
and saved the world

666
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,356
and fought back
an invading army of the undead.

667
00:57:52,489 --> 00:57:55,025
Not to mention
a 100-foot marshmallow man.

668
00:57:58,128 --> 00:58:00,497
Our grandfather
was Egon Spengler.

669
00:58:00,631 --> 00:58:01,899
He was a Ghostbuster.

670
00:58:02,032 --> 00:58:03,767
<i>All units,</i>

671
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:06,336
<i>we're getting reports of,
well, some kind of animal</i>

672
00:58:06,469 --> 00:58:08,906
<i>taking a bite
out of Steve Fletcher's truck.</i>

673
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:11,407
<i>Apparently, he almost took
the whole tailgate off?</i>

674
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:13,610
- Muncher.
- Muncher.

675
00:58:35,532 --> 00:58:38,235
- What should I be looking for?
- Evidence.

676
00:58:53,917 --> 00:58:55,585
Can you stop breathing
in my ear?

677
00:58:55,719 --> 00:58:57,154
No.

678
00:58:57,287 --> 00:58:58,789
You guys,
this is kind of stupid.

679
00:58:58,922 --> 00:59:01,457
Are you sure you didn't see,
like, a raccoon

680
00:59:01,591 --> 00:59:04,061
or, like, a possum?

681
00:59:04,194 --> 00:59:05,095
There!

682
00:59:09,666 --> 00:59:10,934
Is that a...?

683
00:59:11,068 --> 00:59:12,769
Free-floating metal muncher.

684
00:59:12,903 --> 00:59:13,904
Definitely Class Five.

685
00:59:14,037 --> 00:59:16,073
Okay, uh, what do we do?

686
00:59:16,206 --> 00:59:17,941
Let's get him.

687
00:59:18,075 --> 00:59:19,409
What?

688
00:59:19,543 --> 00:59:20,777
Let me get a photo first.

689
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:25,282
Guys?

690
00:59:25,415 --> 00:59:26,783
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

691
00:59:28,285 --> 00:59:30,320
Whoa. It has a gunner seat?

692
00:59:41,965 --> 00:59:43,333
Go, go, go!

693
00:59:43,467 --> 00:59:45,502
Whoa!

694
01:00:00,617 --> 01:00:01,952
Whoa!

695
01:00:21,805 --> 01:00:22,706
What the...?

696
01:00:28,513 --> 01:00:29,780
Uh...

697
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:41,191
- Yes!
- Trap him!

698
01:00:56,706 --> 01:00:59,176
Okay. Okay. Here we go.

699
01:01:08,018 --> 01:01:09,219
Come on, keep it straight.

700
01:01:09,352 --> 01:01:10,887
You try driving this thing.

701
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,093
Left, left, left!

702
01:01:33,544 --> 01:01:35,580
- Ready!
- Trap him already!

703
01:01:35,712 --> 01:01:37,681
- Three, two...
- Three, two, one...

704
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:02,472
Oh, my God,
what just happened?

705
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:06,409
He's heading for
the mountain.

706
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:21,358
- Closer.
- Okay.

707
01:02:21,492 --> 01:02:22,993
I'm in range.

708
01:02:53,658 --> 01:02:55,091
She got him!

709
01:03:06,469 --> 01:03:08,506
Whatever we're doing,
we have to do it now.

710
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:11,374
Come on!

711
01:03:24,154 --> 01:03:25,021
- Yes!
- Yeah!

712
01:03:25,155 --> 01:03:26,423
Bridge!

713
01:03:52,082 --> 01:03:53,216
What was that?

714
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:55,151
I think we just caught
a ghost.

715
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:01,291
Ugh!

716
01:04:01,424 --> 01:04:02,325
Sorry.

717
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,062
I was here last night.

718
01:04:18,041 --> 01:04:19,710
Does any of this bother you?

719
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:21,712
What do you mean?

720
01:04:21,845 --> 01:04:23,980
Dude, your grandfather
was a legend.

721
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:26,550
You can literally be
anything you want.

722
01:04:26,684 --> 01:04:29,452
Like a influencer or a DJ.

723
01:04:29,587 --> 01:04:31,656
It was easier when I thought
he went nuts.

724
01:04:31,788 --> 01:04:33,123
- He didn't go nuts.
- Exactly.

725
01:04:33,256 --> 01:04:34,424
So why did he leave Mom?

726
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:41,364
Oh, no, no, no.

727
01:04:41,499 --> 01:04:43,166
We're screwed.
We're so screwed.

728
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,536
- What do we do?
- I say we fight.

729
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:48,104
What? No.
Just check the glove box.

730
01:04:51,941 --> 01:04:53,310
License and registration.

731
01:04:54,679 --> 01:04:56,379
We were on that big mountain,

732
01:04:56,514 --> 01:04:59,617
and I went to go hang out with
this girl in this mining cage.

733
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,385
All of a sudden, it started
shaking, like an earthquake.

734
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,853
And there were lights,

735
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:06,323
and then I looked down
in this giant hole.

736
01:05:06,456 --> 01:05:08,526
Inside of it,
right in the middle of it,

737
01:05:08,659 --> 01:05:11,828
was either a person
or a reptile...

738
01:05:11,961 --> 01:05:13,698
Are you even
paying attention?

739
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:16,032
Yeah. I'm just excited
we're in jail.

740
01:05:17,635 --> 01:05:21,806
I thought I heard something
say, "Gozer."

741
01:05:21,938 --> 01:05:25,475
He speaks the truth.
I was there.

742
01:05:26,976 --> 01:05:30,380
Hey. Hi. How...?
What brings you here?

743
01:05:30,514 --> 01:05:33,116
Actually, you could help me
with hiding something.

744
01:05:33,249 --> 01:05:34,685
- Yeah, yeah.
- Do you have priors?

745
01:05:34,819 --> 01:05:36,186
'Cause they'll charge you
as a minor.

746
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:37,655
You'll get two years. Max.

747
01:05:37,788 --> 01:05:39,389
- Two?
- I'll visit you, okay?

748
01:05:39,523 --> 01:05:40,825
Lucky.

749
01:05:40,957 --> 01:05:43,059
Quit messing with my inmates.

750
01:05:43,193 --> 01:05:44,729
Sorry, Dad.

751
01:05:45,962 --> 01:05:47,430
"Dad." So you're just...

752
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:52,035
Waiting for my ride. Yeah.

753
01:05:52,168 --> 01:05:54,270
But you look good behind bars.

754
01:05:55,539 --> 01:05:58,676
Hey. Don't we get a phone call?

755
01:05:58,809 --> 01:05:59,909
Sure you do.

756
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,714
Who you gonna call?

757
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:07,518
Make it quick.

758
01:06:15,325 --> 01:06:16,926
<i>Do you experience
feelings of dread</i>

759
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,529
<i>in your basement
or attic?</i>

760
01:06:21,898 --> 01:06:23,233
<i>Have you
or any of your family</i>

761
01:06:23,366 --> 01:06:25,335
<i>ever seen a spook, specter,
or ghost?</i>

762
01:06:27,805 --> 01:06:30,273
<i>If the answer is yes,
then don't wait another minute.</i>

763
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:32,610
<i>Pick up your phone
and call the professionals.</i>

764
01:06:51,361 --> 01:06:52,797
Ray's Occult, and we're closed.

765
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:55,331
<i>Wait!
I only get one phone call.</i>

766
01:06:55,465 --> 01:06:56,734
I'm...

767
01:06:58,201 --> 01:06:59,904
- in prison.
- <i>Hmm.</i>

768
01:07:00,036 --> 01:07:02,640
The slammer, huh?
I've been there myself.

769
01:07:02,773 --> 01:07:04,941
<i>I'm not a lawyer,
but I'm listening.</i>

770
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:08,813
<i>Are you Ray Stantz,
the Ghostbuster?</i>

771
01:07:08,945 --> 01:07:11,715
- And now I'm hanging up.
- <i>Hang on. Please.</i>

772
01:07:13,216 --> 01:07:15,985
I... I'm calling
about Egon Spengler.

773
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:23,059
Egon Spengler can rot in hell.

774
01:07:28,064 --> 01:07:30,266
He died last week.

775
01:07:35,104 --> 01:07:36,339
Oh, man.

776
01:07:38,776 --> 01:07:40,076
No kidding.

777
01:07:42,813 --> 01:07:44,482
Weren't you two friends?

778
01:07:44,615 --> 01:07:46,316
<i>That was a long time ago.</i>

779
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:49,118
What happened to you guys?

780
01:07:51,254 --> 01:07:55,124
Oh, well, look, when we started,
busting ghosts was a gas.

781
01:07:55,258 --> 01:07:58,662
The economy was good.
Reagan years.

782
01:07:58,796 --> 01:08:00,363
People believed in us.

783
01:08:00,498 --> 01:08:03,399
Then things got slow,
hauntings got thin.

784
01:08:03,534 --> 01:08:06,336
Venkman thought
we did our job too well.

785
01:08:07,705 --> 01:08:10,508
We could barely keep up
our mortgage.

786
01:08:10,641 --> 01:08:12,475
Some actor bought up
most of Tribeca,

787
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:14,043
and we lost the firehouse.

788
01:08:14,177 --> 01:08:15,646
It's a Starbucks now.

789
01:08:16,947 --> 01:08:19,048
So then you all
just walked away?

790
01:08:19,182 --> 01:08:20,985
Peter went back to academia.

791
01:08:21,117 --> 01:08:23,621
He's at SUNY Cortland now.
He's a professor emeritus.

792
01:08:23,754 --> 01:08:26,356
He teaches advertising
and promotion.

793
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:27,825
Winston went into finance.

794
01:08:27,958 --> 01:08:29,860
He worked hard,
coined a fortune and...

795
01:08:29,994 --> 01:08:31,027
And I'm here.

796
01:08:32,696 --> 01:08:35,866
- Well, what about Egon?
- <i>Well, he wasn't helping.</i>

797
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,369
We went from ten calls a week
to one if we were lucky.

798
01:08:39,503 --> 01:08:40,838
Egon started to tell people

799
01:08:40,971 --> 01:08:42,740
that their ghost problems
didn't matter

800
01:08:42,873 --> 01:08:44,173
because the world
was coming to an end.

801
01:08:44,307 --> 01:08:46,209
<i>He got spooky. Freaked me out.</i>

802
01:08:46,342 --> 01:08:47,578
One morning, I go to work

803
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:49,613
and Ecto-1, our old Cadillac,
is gone,

804
01:08:49,747 --> 01:08:52,616
his neutrona thrower,
collider pack, all the traps,

805
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:55,184
16 ounces of fuel isotope,
all gone!

806
01:08:55,318 --> 01:08:56,419
He cleaned us out.

807
01:08:57,488 --> 01:08:59,023
Now we were the dead ones.

808
01:08:59,155 --> 01:09:00,925
Don't you think
he had a reason?

809
01:09:01,057 --> 01:09:03,293
He phoned me
about ten years later,

810
01:09:03,426 --> 01:09:05,395
some small town in Oklahoma.

811
01:09:05,529 --> 01:09:07,765
He kept rambling
about "the rising storm"

812
01:09:07,898 --> 01:09:09,465
and "the huge psychic tornado"

813
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,403
that was gonna "consume
humanity in darkness forever."

814
01:09:13,537 --> 01:09:15,573
And, kid, I wanted to believe.

815
01:09:15,706 --> 01:09:17,741
You don't understand.
There is this mountain

816
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:19,577
and it has these
ancient carvings...

817
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:21,411
<i>Kid, there are
a lot of mountains</i>

818
01:09:21,545 --> 01:09:22,913
<i>with ancient carvings.</i>

819
01:09:24,147 --> 01:09:25,950
Take a little advice.

820
01:09:26,082 --> 01:09:27,785
Don't go chasing ghosts.

821
01:09:30,086 --> 01:09:32,455
Egon Spengler
was my grandfather.

822
01:09:33,924 --> 01:09:34,858
Time's up.

823
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:37,126
Hey, hello?

824
01:09:43,934 --> 01:09:45,803
- Where are my kids?
- They're in the lockup.

825
01:09:45,936 --> 01:09:47,805
My children are not criminals.

826
01:09:47,938 --> 01:09:50,641
- Sure they're not.
- Driving without a license.

827
01:09:50,774 --> 01:09:54,078
Expired registration.
Speeding.

828
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:56,312
They can't be the first
to go joyriding.

829
01:09:56,446 --> 01:09:58,983
No, they are not.
But they are the first

830
01:09:59,115 --> 01:10:02,251
to destroy half of Main Street
with whatever that thing is.

831
01:10:02,385 --> 01:10:03,520
Whoa!

832
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,359
- Sorry.
- What were you thinking?

833
01:10:09,493 --> 01:10:13,329
You know, you two could have
really hurt yourselves.

834
01:10:15,099 --> 01:10:16,600
Hey. I'm Gary.

835
01:10:16,734 --> 01:10:18,301
You process them out yet?

836
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:24,608
Did you catch anything?

837
01:10:24,742 --> 01:10:25,776
It's inside the trap.

838
01:10:25,909 --> 01:10:27,578
- Right now?
- Yes.

839
01:10:27,711 --> 01:10:29,680
Let's go. You were supposed
to look after her this summer.

840
01:10:29,813 --> 01:10:31,482
- I was?
- Not you. Him.

841
01:10:31,615 --> 01:10:32,850
This was her idea.

842
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:35,119
But what about our stuff?
The Ecto-1?

843
01:10:35,251 --> 01:10:38,287
Everything will remain nice
and safe in our impound locker.

844
01:10:38,421 --> 01:10:41,190
- No! We need it.
- Phoebe, let's go.

845
01:10:41,324 --> 01:10:43,292
We caught a ghost tonight.

846
01:10:43,426 --> 01:10:46,096
- Dirt Farmer's family.
- It's true.

847
01:10:47,598 --> 01:10:48,999
And there will be more.

848
01:10:49,133 --> 01:10:51,735
You're starting to sound
like your lunatic grandfather.

849
01:10:53,469 --> 01:10:56,740
Phoebe! She didn't mean it.

850
01:10:56,874 --> 01:10:59,009
You wanna spend the night
in my jail?

851
01:11:03,947 --> 01:11:05,649
You can... You can keep it.

852
01:11:10,286 --> 01:11:11,822
Go. Now.

853
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:18,062
- Trevor.
- I'll see you at work.

854
01:11:18,194 --> 01:11:19,496
Yeah. See you.

855
01:11:21,297 --> 01:11:22,198
Hey.

856
01:11:40,784 --> 01:11:41,919
All right, you guys.

857
01:11:42,052 --> 01:11:43,419
Remember that...

858
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:44,722
Yeah, you got it.

859
01:11:51,562 --> 01:11:53,262
I'm sorry the night
went sideways.

860
01:11:53,396 --> 01:11:55,766
No. I-I had a blast.

861
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:58,267
Why don't we just pick it up
tomorrow night, same time.

862
01:11:58,401 --> 01:12:00,938
- You really want more of this?
- Are you kidding me?

863
01:12:01,071 --> 01:12:04,141
We had kung pao shrimp.
We went to jail.

864
01:12:04,273 --> 01:12:07,611
I don't know how we're gonna
top this. This is a home run.

865
01:12:11,181 --> 01:12:14,250
Um, my life is a dumpster fire.

866
01:12:14,383 --> 01:12:17,721
I love dumpster fires.
You should see my apartment.

867
01:12:17,855 --> 01:12:20,758
I don't mean now.
Or a-anytime soon.

868
01:12:20,891 --> 01:12:24,194
You don't want to...
I'd need to clean...

869
01:12:24,327 --> 01:12:27,363
This is moving way too fast.
You gotta just relax.

870
01:12:29,066 --> 01:12:31,334
The kids hungry?
They want some of this, uh,

871
01:12:31,467 --> 01:12:33,570
unrefrigerated shrimp?

872
01:12:46,183 --> 01:12:48,552
- We're barely hanging on here.
- You don't understand.

873
01:12:48,685 --> 01:12:50,254
I understand
you drove around town,

874
01:12:50,386 --> 01:12:52,089
destroying
expensive property.

875
01:12:53,757 --> 01:12:56,325
Don't you think your father
came out here for a reason?

876
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:57,828
No.

877
01:12:57,961 --> 01:13:00,664
No. I think
he was a sad old man

878
01:13:00,798 --> 01:13:03,033
who turned his back
on his family, his partners.

879
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:06,670
And for what? For a stupid farm
in a town nobody cares about.

880
01:13:06,804 --> 01:13:09,139
Where, by the way,
everybody thought he was nuts.

881
01:13:09,273 --> 01:13:11,340
Yeah, great decision, Dad.

882
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:15,546
He was special.
He loved science, like me.

883
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:18,314
Why didn't you tell me my
grandfather was Egon Spengler?

884
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:25,489
Hey, I'm glad you found yourself
here. I really am.

885
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:29,092
But all I see are reminders

886
01:13:29,226 --> 01:13:31,595
that I didn't mean a thing
to him.

887
01:13:31,728 --> 01:13:33,429
He never cared about me.

888
01:13:40,336 --> 01:13:42,039
He's not nuts.

889
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:44,708
Well, then he's an asshole.

890
01:13:46,109 --> 01:13:48,011
Welcome to the family.

891
01:14:28,151 --> 01:14:29,152
Yeah.

892
01:14:44,801 --> 01:14:46,003
Jamoca.

893
01:14:47,204 --> 01:14:48,772
There we go.

894
01:14:48,906 --> 01:14:50,941
Strawberry, red velvet...

895
01:14:52,542 --> 01:14:53,577
Blue velvet?

896
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,835
Aah! Ah.

897
01:16:15,092 --> 01:16:16,059
Oh, God.

898
01:17:34,171 --> 01:17:35,038
Hey...

899
01:18:19,716 --> 01:18:23,120
Okay, so,
what exactly is happening with the map?

900
01:18:23,253 --> 01:18:25,455
See the concentric circles
around the mountain?

901
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:26,656
No.

902
01:18:27,991 --> 01:18:30,660
- Do you see the circles?
- Yes.

903
01:18:30,794 --> 01:18:33,296
Something's happening
inside that old mine.

904
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:36,133
Yeah. I know that.
It's pretty obvious.

905
01:18:36,266 --> 01:18:38,268
So I did some digging
on the word you heard

906
01:18:38,401 --> 01:18:39,336
in the mountain. "Gozer."

907
01:18:39,469 --> 01:18:40,470
You did some digging?

908
01:18:40,605 --> 01:18:42,005
Gozer was a Sumerian god

909
01:18:42,139 --> 01:18:43,707
who once walked
amongst the living.

910
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,976
A soul-eating,
flame-dripping deity of evil.

911
01:18:46,109 --> 01:18:47,612
And I think it wants back.

912
01:18:47,744 --> 01:18:49,045
Here?

913
01:18:49,179 --> 01:18:51,214
I know.
I would've picked Orlando.

914
01:18:51,348 --> 01:18:53,618
What does the name Ivo Shandor
mean to you guys?

915
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:56,621
Ivo Shandor?
He built this whole town.

916
01:18:56,753 --> 01:19:00,123
He built the mine, foundry,
the school, library.

917
01:19:00,257 --> 01:19:02,292
- His name is on everything.
- That's tacky.

918
01:19:02,425 --> 01:19:04,495
In New York, he created
an apartment building

919
01:19:04,629 --> 01:19:07,197
made out of selenium girders,
mined from right here.

920
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:09,799
On that same rooftop is
where our grandfather fought

921
01:19:09,933 --> 01:19:12,469
to keep a horde of ghosts
from entering our dimension.

922
01:19:12,603 --> 01:19:15,805
Phoebe, what exactly
is happening here?

923
01:19:15,939 --> 01:19:18,643
I can only think of one way
for us to find out.

924
01:19:31,454 --> 01:19:34,724
So, what do a cigarette
and hamster have in common?

925
01:19:36,927 --> 01:19:39,497
- What?
- They're both harmless

926
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:42,232
until you stick one in your
mouth and light it on fire.

927
01:19:44,968 --> 01:19:46,571
The worst time.

928
01:20:10,561 --> 01:20:11,696
Hey, guys, look.

929
01:20:37,754 --> 01:20:38,656
Is that her?

930
01:20:40,357 --> 01:20:41,891
Is that Gozer?

931
01:20:42,025 --> 01:20:44,261
Gozer isn't he or she.

932
01:20:44,394 --> 01:20:47,063
Pretty woke for 3000 BC.

933
01:20:47,197 --> 01:20:48,798
Everyone watch their steps.

934
01:20:50,467 --> 01:20:51,602
Another hole?

935
01:20:54,237 --> 01:20:56,574
I wonder where
this one leads to.

936
01:20:56,707 --> 01:20:58,108
A sacrificial death pit.

937
01:20:59,376 --> 01:21:00,810
What were they sacrificing?

938
01:21:00,944 --> 01:21:02,680
Virgins, probably.

939
01:21:02,812 --> 01:21:05,248
Tough luck for you, dude.
Sorry.

940
01:21:05,382 --> 01:21:08,184
Well, statistically,
most 15-year-olds are virgins.

941
01:21:08,318 --> 01:21:09,953
Shh! Oh...

942
01:21:10,086 --> 01:21:12,556
Fifteen? You're 15?

943
01:21:14,057 --> 01:21:15,493
I'll be 16 in February.

944
01:21:15,626 --> 01:21:17,227
It's June.

945
01:21:18,795 --> 01:21:20,430
What are those holes
in the wall?

946
01:21:24,535 --> 01:21:25,770
They're vacancies.

947
01:21:27,404 --> 01:21:29,906
If this is a tomb,
where are all the bodies?

948
01:21:31,274 --> 01:21:32,409
Found one.

949
01:21:33,744 --> 01:21:34,944
Oh.

950
01:21:42,586 --> 01:21:45,155
- What?
- Oh, my God.

951
01:21:45,288 --> 01:21:47,257
Is he sleeping?

952
01:21:47,390 --> 01:21:49,259
Dude, he's in a coffin.

953
01:21:49,392 --> 01:21:54,030
It's Ivo Shandor.
He's been in here for 75 years?

954
01:21:54,164 --> 01:21:55,533
He looks fantastic.

955
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:58,335
You know when you die,
your fingernails keep growing.

956
01:21:58,468 --> 01:22:00,470
Not true.
Your skin just shrinks.

957
01:22:00,604 --> 01:22:02,640
Something was
coming and he knew it.

958
01:22:05,776 --> 01:22:07,143
I think these are years.

959
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:10,380
1883.

960
01:22:12,248 --> 01:22:13,784
The Krakatoa eruption.

961
01:22:13,917 --> 01:22:16,419
The most violent volcanic
activity in human history.

962
01:22:16,554 --> 01:22:18,823
What happened in 1908?

963
01:22:18,955 --> 01:22:21,759
Probably the
Tunguska blast over Siberia.

964
01:22:21,891 --> 01:22:23,026
1945.

965
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:25,563
What didn't happen?

966
01:22:26,896 --> 01:22:28,833
1984.

967
01:22:28,965 --> 01:22:30,701
Ghosts attack New York City.

968
01:22:30,835 --> 01:22:32,435
The Manhattan Crossrip.

969
01:22:40,377 --> 01:22:43,446
- It's a countdown.
- Like a prophecy?

970
01:22:43,581 --> 01:22:44,881
Do you guys hear that?

971
01:22:56,494 --> 01:22:57,595
Yeah, I do.

972
01:23:04,901 --> 01:23:07,203
I think it's coming
from the death pit.

973
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:28,024
Phoebe.

974
01:23:43,674 --> 01:23:44,575
Phoebe!

975
01:23:50,113 --> 01:23:51,214
The earthquakes.

976
01:23:54,951 --> 01:23:57,655
- Oh, my gosh!
- Phoebe!

977
01:23:57,788 --> 01:23:59,890
Phoebe.

978
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,464
Phoebe.

979
01:24:28,919 --> 01:24:30,554
I think he's alive.

980
01:24:30,688 --> 01:24:33,624
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

981
01:24:33,757 --> 01:24:35,024
- Are you?
- Yeah.

982
01:24:39,864 --> 01:24:41,632
Pheebs, what's wrong?

983
01:24:41,765 --> 01:24:43,166
He was right all along.

984
01:24:44,502 --> 01:24:47,370
- What do you mean?
- Our grandfather.

985
01:24:47,505 --> 01:24:50,073
He was right here.
He built this.

986
01:24:50,206 --> 01:24:52,743
He was standing guard,
even when no one believed him.

987
01:24:54,979 --> 01:24:57,146
He sacrificed everything.

988
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,749
His life.

989
01:24:59,984 --> 01:25:01,184
His friends.

990
01:25:04,454 --> 01:25:05,421
Us.

991
01:25:10,393 --> 01:25:11,361
Bummer.

992
01:25:13,898 --> 01:25:14,832
Dude.

993
01:25:17,535 --> 01:25:19,202
We need to tell Mom.

994
01:25:19,335 --> 01:25:20,436
Phoebe?

995
01:25:22,438 --> 01:25:23,339
Pheebs?

996
01:27:58,629 --> 01:27:59,530
Mom?

997
01:28:04,835 --> 01:28:05,736
Mom?

998
01:28:08,371 --> 01:28:11,809
There is no Mom.
There is only Zuul.

999
01:28:17,213 --> 01:28:19,183
Mom, are you okay?

1000
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:28,291
There is no Mom.
There is only Zuul.

1001
01:28:31,562 --> 01:28:32,863
What's happening right now?

1002
01:28:34,732 --> 01:28:36,399
Mom?

1003
01:28:36,533 --> 01:28:37,701
Is she okay?

1004
01:28:37,835 --> 01:28:38,702
Mom?

1005
01:28:51,347 --> 01:28:53,416
Are you the Keymaster?

1006
01:28:53,550 --> 01:28:55,986
- Um, I don't know.
- Mom!

1007
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:57,386
- What do I do?
- Mom, stop!

1008
01:28:57,521 --> 01:28:58,889
Whoa!

1009
01:29:59,116 --> 01:30:00,117
Mom!

1010
01:30:04,254 --> 01:30:06,690
What the hell is going on?

1011
01:30:33,283 --> 01:30:34,484
What is all this?

1012
01:30:36,053 --> 01:30:37,254
This isn't a farm.

1013
01:30:39,857 --> 01:30:41,258
It's a trap.

1014
01:31:10,921 --> 01:31:11,855
What?

1015
01:31:12,923 --> 01:31:13,857
Nothing.

1016
01:31:16,193 --> 01:31:18,528
This is what he's been working
on all those years.

1017
01:31:18,662 --> 01:31:20,530
- Building this model?
- The detail is amazing.

1018
01:31:20,664 --> 01:31:21,932
No, he came here to finish

1019
01:31:22,065 --> 01:31:23,867
what the original
Ghostbusters started.

1020
01:31:24,001 --> 01:31:25,802
- To trap Gozer...
- Out in that dirt field.

1021
01:31:25,936 --> 01:31:28,538
Exactly. These big silos act
as a capacitor.

1022
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:32,441
- What's a capacitor?
- Would it kill you to read?

1023
01:31:32,576 --> 01:31:34,077
Would it kill you
to just tell me?

1024
01:31:34,211 --> 01:31:35,444
Once activated,
these towers

1025
01:31:35,579 --> 01:31:37,214
can hold a charge
for one moment.

1026
01:31:37,347 --> 01:31:39,616
But in that one moment, they
can power hundreds of traps.

1027
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:42,019
So how do we get Gozer
into the field?

1028
01:31:42,152 --> 01:31:43,887
Gozer's protected
by two evil spirits.

1029
01:31:44,021 --> 01:31:45,421
The Keymaster
and the Gatekeeper.

1030
01:31:45,555 --> 01:31:48,692
She needs both of them.
No Gatekeeper, no Gozer.

1031
01:31:48,825 --> 01:31:51,595
First these spirits must
possess two human souls.

1032
01:31:51,728 --> 01:31:54,064
- Like Mom.
- So they can unite...

1033
01:31:55,165 --> 01:31:56,533
formally.

1034
01:31:58,535 --> 01:31:59,736
What are we talking about?

1035
01:31:59,870 --> 01:32:01,939
We're thinking
at least third base.

1036
01:32:02,072 --> 01:32:02,973
Go, Mom.

1037
01:32:26,029 --> 01:32:27,564
I like your eyes.

1038
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:31,335
Thanks.

1039
01:32:53,023 --> 01:32:54,191
They were just here.

1040
01:32:56,927 --> 01:32:57,828
There she is.

1041
01:33:02,632 --> 01:33:05,969
- Got anything?
- No, just more stupid guns.

1042
01:33:08,338 --> 01:33:11,575
A jail inside a jail.

1043
01:33:11,708 --> 01:33:13,243
What are you talking about?

1044
01:33:14,344 --> 01:33:15,812
No, no, no!

1045
01:33:18,181 --> 01:33:21,251
It's an ANSI Class One
electromagnetic deadbolt.

1046
01:33:22,386 --> 01:33:23,553
I believe in you.

1047
01:33:25,188 --> 01:33:26,189
It's unpickable.

1048
01:33:38,802 --> 01:33:41,805
- What are you doing?
- I have a plan.

1049
01:33:43,974 --> 01:33:44,875
Wait!

1050
01:34:08,732 --> 01:34:10,600
Come on. Let's go.

1051
01:34:10,734 --> 01:34:11,735
Okay.

1052
01:34:16,907 --> 01:34:18,275
- Ready?
- I'll be waiting.

1053
01:35:04,821 --> 01:35:06,323
That's my mom.

1054
01:35:25,108 --> 01:35:26,143
What?

1055
01:35:59,610 --> 01:36:00,710
Your Eminence.

1056
01:36:02,078 --> 01:36:04,181
Goddess of Gods.

1057
01:36:04,314 --> 01:36:07,717
I have built this temple
for you,

1058
01:36:07,851 --> 01:36:09,654
so that you might return
to Earth...

1059
01:36:11,755 --> 01:36:12,722
<i>and together...</i>

1060
01:36:15,158 --> 01:36:16,159
<i>we...</i>

1061
01:36:17,794 --> 01:36:19,162
We can rule the world.

1062
01:36:49,192 --> 01:36:50,260
Excuse me.

1063
01:36:51,562 --> 01:36:52,796
Uh...

1064
01:36:52,929 --> 01:36:54,699
P-pardon me.

1065
01:36:54,831 --> 01:36:56,299
Yeah, hi.

1066
01:36:57,367 --> 01:36:58,735
Uh...

1067
01:37:02,205 --> 01:37:03,206
Uh...

1068
01:37:05,442 --> 01:37:08,111
What do you call a fish
with no eyes?

1069
01:37:12,048 --> 01:37:15,252
A fsh...

1070
01:37:17,854 --> 01:37:19,089
Uh...

1071
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:21,758
A whale...

1072
01:37:21,891 --> 01:37:24,060
There's two whales in a bar.
One of them goes:

1073
01:37:28,965 --> 01:37:30,934
And then the other one goes:

1074
01:37:31,067 --> 01:37:32,637
"Go home. You're drunk."

1075
01:37:35,438 --> 01:37:37,007
Uh...

1076
01:37:40,043 --> 01:37:41,778
- Okay.
- Uh...

1077
01:37:41,911 --> 01:37:44,682
So a grasshopper
walks into a bar...

1078
01:37:45,815 --> 01:37:47,450
and the bartender's like:

1079
01:37:47,585 --> 01:37:49,986
"We have a drink
named after you."

1080
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:51,454
Then the grasshopper's like:

1081
01:37:52,623 --> 01:37:55,660
"You have a drink named Steve?"

1082
01:37:59,429 --> 01:38:03,900
Have you come
to offer yourself in sacrifice?

1083
01:38:04,034 --> 01:38:05,335
What?

1084
01:38:06,803 --> 01:38:09,740
Are you prepared to die?

1085
01:38:11,274 --> 01:38:12,976
No, I'm 12.

1086
01:38:16,379 --> 01:38:17,515
Are you?

1087
01:38:28,626 --> 01:38:29,794
Mom!

1088
01:38:51,014 --> 01:38:53,416
- Wait, wait. What's going on?
- Hey!

1089
01:38:53,551 --> 01:38:55,318
- What's happening? Where am I?
- It's okay.

1090
01:38:55,452 --> 01:38:56,754
- You were possessed.
- Possessed?

1091
01:38:56,886 --> 01:38:59,590
- Then you turned into a dog.
- Then you got humpy.

1092
01:38:59,724 --> 01:39:00,758
- Humpy?
- Hold on!

1093
01:39:14,638 --> 01:39:18,274
Oh, Phoebe. Phoebe.
There's this secret basement...

1094
01:39:18,408 --> 01:39:20,745
- We know.
- ...with computers and equipment.

1095
01:39:20,877 --> 01:39:22,278
- Isn't that place insane?
- Yes!

1096
01:39:22,412 --> 01:39:25,248
And it seemed
like he had a plan.

1097
01:39:25,382 --> 01:39:26,751
- We're aware.
- Oh. Oh.

1098
01:39:26,883 --> 01:39:29,252
And there were
all these photos of me.

1099
01:39:29,386 --> 01:39:31,589
Like he was tracking
my entire life.

1100
01:39:31,722 --> 01:39:33,056
- How rewarding.
- Super news.

1101
01:39:33,189 --> 01:39:34,391
We wanna hear about it.

1102
01:39:34,525 --> 01:39:36,627
Yeah, but we're trying
to save the world.

1103
01:39:36,761 --> 01:39:39,129
Okay. Cool. I'm in.
Uh, how can I help?

1104
01:39:39,262 --> 01:39:41,364
- No!
- What the hell was that?

1105
01:39:41,499 --> 01:39:43,967
- That was your boyfriend Gary.
- Boyfriend?

1106
01:39:52,075 --> 01:39:53,644
Inside that trap
is the Gatekeeper.

1107
01:39:53,778 --> 01:39:55,078
- Gatekeeper?
- If the Gatekeeper

1108
01:39:55,211 --> 01:39:56,112
and the Keymaster reunite...

1109
01:39:56,246 --> 01:39:58,381
- Keymaster?
- One second.

1110
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:09,192
Phoebe.

1111
01:40:09,325 --> 01:40:11,361
You're... You're...

1112
01:40:13,329 --> 01:40:14,464
I'm a scientist.

1113
01:40:17,934 --> 01:40:20,103
- Oh. We got her!
- Yes!

1114
01:40:20,236 --> 01:40:21,572
This was Grandpa's plan.

1115
01:40:23,339 --> 01:40:24,474
Coming in hot!

1116
01:40:45,863 --> 01:40:47,397
Mom, come on!

1117
01:40:47,531 --> 01:40:48,566
Oh, my God.

1118
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:03,213
- Get back. Get back.
- Mom.

1119
01:41:06,650 --> 01:41:08,017
- What's up?
- Hey.

1120
01:41:12,790 --> 01:41:13,724
No, no, no.

1121
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:50,828
Pull the lever.

1122
01:41:50,961 --> 01:41:51,862
Pull...?

1123
01:42:03,641 --> 01:42:04,542
Aah!

1124
01:42:05,275 --> 01:42:06,209
Hey!

1125
01:42:17,688 --> 01:42:19,490
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

1126
01:42:19,623 --> 01:42:20,991
I'm waiting
for this thing to work!

1127
01:42:21,124 --> 01:42:22,425
- It's not working!
- Uh...

1128
01:42:38,408 --> 01:42:40,209
- Mom, hit the pedal!
- Pedal?

1129
01:42:57,226 --> 01:42:58,596
Lucky!

1130
01:42:58,729 --> 01:43:00,030
Podcast,
what are you doing?

1131
01:43:00,163 --> 01:43:01,565
I've got my own problems!

1132
01:43:51,482 --> 01:43:52,516
Oh, no.

1133
01:43:54,250 --> 01:43:55,151
No.

1134
01:44:00,124 --> 01:44:01,391
Hey, flattop.

1135
01:44:04,762 --> 01:44:05,929
Have you missed us?

1136
01:44:10,433 --> 01:44:12,536
Gozer the Gozerian...

1137
01:44:12,670 --> 01:44:15,405
...in the name of the county of
Summerville, state of Oklahoma,

1138
01:44:15,539 --> 01:44:17,141
the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service,

1139
01:44:17,273 --> 01:44:19,275
all the members
of Ducks Unlimited,

1140
01:44:19,409 --> 01:44:21,979
the Association for the
Advancement of Retired Persons,

1141
01:44:22,112 --> 01:44:25,381
I command you under the National
Invasive Species Act

1142
01:44:25,516 --> 01:44:28,719
to depart this world
immediately.

1143
01:44:28,852 --> 01:44:29,787
Bravo.

1144
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:35,324
I think she remembers us.

1145
01:44:38,629 --> 01:44:40,396
Are you...

1146
01:44:40,531 --> 01:44:42,032
a god?

1147
01:44:45,301 --> 01:44:47,071
- Ray?
- Oh, come on, Ray.

1148
01:44:48,672 --> 01:44:49,807
Yes.

1149
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:51,909
Yeah, we're all gods.

1150
01:44:52,042 --> 01:44:54,578
Yeah, I mean, we're all pretty
dang special down here.

1151
01:44:54,712 --> 01:44:55,979
On a personal note:

1152
01:44:56,113 --> 01:44:58,549
I thought that we had busted up
for good.

1153
01:44:58,682 --> 01:45:00,150
It wasn't working for me.

1154
01:45:00,283 --> 01:45:03,352
My friends didn't think so.
I know yours didn't.

1155
01:45:03,487 --> 01:45:05,723
Okay, playtime's over.
Let's toast this muffin.

1156
01:45:08,859 --> 01:45:10,226
Light them up.

1157
01:45:11,895 --> 01:45:13,864
Man, I love that sound.

1158
01:45:15,933 --> 01:45:17,233
On the count of three.

1159
01:45:17,366 --> 01:45:19,870
Go on "two." One. Two.

1160
01:45:22,773 --> 01:45:25,408
Yeah, nothing stings
like a billion electron volts!

1161
01:45:35,351 --> 01:45:36,487
Yes!

1162
01:45:38,188 --> 01:45:39,156
- Do you feel that?
- Yeah.

1163
01:45:39,288 --> 01:45:40,224
Uh-oh.

1164
01:45:44,427 --> 01:45:46,262
She's uncrossing
the streams!

1165
01:45:51,702 --> 01:45:52,803
- No!
- Oh!

1166
01:45:54,938 --> 01:45:55,806
Are they dead?

1167
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:01,979
I don't remember
this job being so painful.

1168
01:46:03,279 --> 01:46:05,849
- I do.
- You got a lot of nerve.

1169
01:46:07,885 --> 01:46:11,387
Coming back here,
crawling back to me.

1170
01:46:11,522 --> 01:46:14,825
We could've been the most
spectacular power couple.

1171
01:46:14,958 --> 01:46:19,263
You know, my sense of fun
and your personality.

1172
01:46:19,395 --> 01:46:22,331
But, no, you always had
to vanquish and conquer.

1173
01:46:22,465 --> 01:46:24,001
Always had to maim somebody.

1174
01:46:24,134 --> 01:46:27,638
And that's probably
the number one reason why...

1175
01:46:27,771 --> 01:46:29,239
Good try, anyway.

1176
01:46:29,372 --> 01:46:31,474
Now we're finished, babe.

1177
01:46:31,608 --> 01:46:32,743
We're finished.

1178
01:46:41,552 --> 01:46:42,451
No.

1179
01:46:54,832 --> 01:46:56,200
Come on, Phoebe.

1180
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:23,861
Holy shit.

1181
01:48:07,571 --> 01:48:08,538
We're on!

1182
01:49:10,934 --> 01:49:12,269
I thought
you might turn up.

1183
01:49:18,075 --> 01:49:18,976
I'm sorry...

1184
01:49:20,110 --> 01:49:21,645
I didn't believe you.

1185
01:49:23,914 --> 01:49:24,982
I should've called.

1186
01:49:26,249 --> 01:49:27,484
I miss you, my friend.

1187
01:49:33,757 --> 01:49:35,125
Are you okay?

1188
01:49:35,258 --> 01:49:37,127
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Mom.

1189
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:38,528
I can't breathe.

1190
01:49:38,662 --> 01:49:39,663
Okay.

1191
01:49:41,298 --> 01:49:42,833
Hi there.

1192
01:49:42,966 --> 01:49:44,668
Pete Venkman
from the home office.

1193
01:49:44,801 --> 01:49:47,137
- Thanks for pitching in.
- You're welcome.

1194
01:49:47,270 --> 01:49:48,572
I like your style.

1195
01:49:48,705 --> 01:49:50,207
Who's that one?

1196
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:51,241
Callie.

1197
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:54,878
Callie Spengler.

1198
01:49:55,012 --> 01:49:56,513
- Spengler?
- Mm.

1199
01:49:56,646 --> 01:49:59,549
Weird name.
Try to make the best of that.

1200
01:49:59,683 --> 01:50:02,052
All right.
We're gonna have cocoa inside.

1201
01:50:02,185 --> 01:50:04,354
And some of us
will have rum with it.

1202
01:50:05,689 --> 01:50:06,656
Lucky!

1203
01:50:11,895 --> 01:50:15,165
- Oh.
- God. Hey. Hey, man.

1204
01:50:15,298 --> 01:50:18,668
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I... Yeah.

1205
01:50:18,802 --> 01:50:20,470
My hands hurt
from galloping.

1206
01:50:28,278 --> 01:50:29,913
Oh, my God.

1207
01:50:30,047 --> 01:50:31,516
I totally thought I lost you.

1208
01:50:31,648 --> 01:50:33,150
Sorry about that.

1209
01:50:34,017 --> 01:50:35,185
Well, that was weird.

1210
01:50:35,318 --> 01:50:36,553
Mm-hm. Yeah.

1211
01:50:37,821 --> 01:50:39,022
I'm bleeding.
Why am I bleeding?

1212
01:50:39,156 --> 01:50:40,424
You headbutted a park bench.

1213
01:50:40,557 --> 01:50:42,192
- Oh, right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1214
01:50:44,828 --> 01:50:46,329
- Hi.
- Hi.

1215
01:50:47,498 --> 01:50:50,267
- Um, back there, yeah.
- Yeah.

1216
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,069
I mean, before we became dogs

1217
01:50:52,202 --> 01:50:56,039
and opened the gates of hell,
I think that maybe we, uh...

1218
01:50:56,173 --> 01:50:58,241
Yeah. Yeah, I think so too.

1219
01:50:59,676 --> 01:51:01,278
But then we saved the world,
so...

1220
01:51:01,411 --> 01:51:02,779
That's true.

1221
01:51:06,983 --> 01:51:09,352
Are you all right, son?

1222
01:51:09,487 --> 01:51:13,056
You just singlehandedly defeated
a manifestation of Gozer.

1223
01:51:13,190 --> 01:51:15,058
You gotta be on my podcast.

1224
01:51:15,192 --> 01:51:16,527
Sure. What's it called?

Tell me what this is.

1258
01:55:42,459 --> 01:55:43,393
Lines.

1259
01:55:45,462 --> 01:55:46,731
Two...

1260
01:55:46,863 --> 01:55:48,331
No, three...

1261
01:55:50,133 --> 01:55:51,868
wavy lines.

1262
01:55:55,338 --> 01:55:56,841
- It's amazing.
- You're amazing.

1263
01:55:57,006 --> 01:55:58,509
With your ability to...

1264
01:55:59,677 --> 01:56:01,111
flood my psychic powers.

1265
01:56:01,244 --> 01:56:03,514
I can't believe you used
to shock your students.

1266
01:56:03,647 --> 01:56:06,182
Between us,
I only zapped the guys.

1267
01:56:06,316 --> 01:56:07,450
Aah!

1268
01:56:07,585 --> 01:56:09,285
It was flawed science.

1269
01:56:09,419 --> 01:56:11,020
I know that now. I admit that.

1270
01:56:11,154 --> 01:56:12,422
Ready?

1271
01:56:12,556 --> 01:56:13,858
Try this one.

1272
01:56:16,827 --> 01:56:17,728
Take a moment.

1273
01:56:18,895 --> 01:56:20,196
Uh...

1274
01:56:22,833 --> 01:56:24,367
It's a five-pointed star.

1275
01:56:25,536 --> 01:56:27,571
- Yes?
- How are you doing that?

1276
01:56:27,705 --> 01:56:29,540
Some believe that true love

1277
01:56:29,673 --> 01:56:32,041
imbues a subject
with the ability...

1278
01:56:32,175 --> 01:56:33,376
Ah!

1279
01:56:33,511 --> 01:56:35,579
- Did you mark the cards?
- No.

1280
01:56:35,713 --> 01:56:36,747
You did, didn't you?

1281
01:56:38,314 --> 01:56:39,215
Yeah.

1282
01:56:43,052 --> 01:56:44,555

- What is it?

1322
02:02:54,925 --> 02:02:56,727
It's a souvenir
from the World's Fair

1323
02:02:56,860 --> 02:03:00,329
at Flushing Meadow
in 1964.

1324
02:03:00,463 --> 02:03:02,132
It's my lucky coin.

1325
02:03:02,266 --> 02:03:05,468
I shouldn't take it.
We might not be coming back.

1326
02:03:05,602 --> 02:03:08,672
Take it anyway.
I got another one at home.

1327
02:03:15,478 --> 02:03:17,480
<i>Egon was the brains.</i>

1328
02:03:17,614 --> 02:03:18,816
<i>Ray was the heart.</i>

1329
02:03:20,217 --> 02:03:21,417
<i>Peter just kept it cool.</i>

1330
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:24,755
Who were you?

1331
02:03:24,888 --> 02:03:25,923
The sex appeal.

1332
02:03:29,893 --> 02:03:32,296
You've done very well
for yourself.

1333
02:03:32,428 --> 02:03:34,765
A lot of shelf space.

1334
02:03:34,898 --> 02:03:37,167
See, that's the thing.

1335
02:03:37,301 --> 02:03:39,002
<i>I don't do it for me.</i>

1336
02:03:40,103 --> 02:03:41,505
<i>I do it for my kids,</i>

1337
02:03:41,638 --> 02:03:44,842
and I wanna be an example
of what's possible.

1338
02:03:44,975 --> 02:03:47,978
You still covering the rent
at Ray's bookshop?

1339
02:03:48,111 --> 02:03:51,648
Ray's gonna turn
a profit one of these days.

1340
02:03:51,782 --> 02:03:55,085
<i>I
remember the day you came in.</i>

1341
02:03:55,219 --> 02:03:58,088
<i>I came in looking
for a steady paycheck.</i>

1342
02:03:58,222 --> 02:04:00,557
<i>But busting ghosts
with the guys...</i>

1343
02:04:00,691 --> 02:04:02,659
taught me not to be afraid.

1344
02:04:02,793 --> 02:04:05,428
That I had the tools
and I had the talent.

1345
02:04:05,562 --> 02:04:09,166
I started this business
with one employee.

1346
02:04:09,299 --> 02:04:12,401
And I've grown it into
a thriving global enterprise.

1347
02:04:13,469 --> 02:04:15,672
I may be a businessman,

1348
02:04:15,806 --> 02:04:18,876
but I will always be
a Ghostbuster.
