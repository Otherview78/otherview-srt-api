1
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,383
Almost.

2
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:41,752
"Almost."

3
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:44,288
Sir, with all due respect,

4
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,723
are you sure
this is our best option?

5
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,692
I mean, why can't we just
correct the problem?

6
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,794
Because my fuckin' nephew

7
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:52,597
killed a dog.

8
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,633
And he stole a car.

9
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:59,470
A car

10
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:02,506
which currently
is among our inventory.

11
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:09,513
So we're giving everything up
for a car?

12
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,718
It's not just a car.

13
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,254
It is John wick's car.

14
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:19,357
Oh.

15
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,432
Sir, why don't we just
give it back?

16
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:31,535
He killed my nephew.

17
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,405
My brother.

18
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:38,342
<i> And a dozen of my men.</i>

19
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:42,546
Over his car.

20
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:45,049
And a puppy.

21
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,021
And you...

22
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,390
You think he will stop now?

23
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,457
<i> Hmm?</i>

24
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:59,030
<i> Sir, he's one man.</i>

25
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,698
Why don't we just
eliminate him?

26
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,004
John wick

27
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,307
<i> is a man of focus...</i>

28
00:05:13,378 --> 00:05:14,745
Commitment...

29
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,588
And sheer fuckin' will!

30
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,640
He once killed
three men in a bar...

31
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,942
With a pencil. I know.
I've heard the story.

32
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,711
With a fucking pencil!

33
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:49,647
Who the fuck can do that?

34
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:53,651
I can assure you

35
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,423
<i> that the stories you hear</i>
<i> about this man,</i>

36
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:05,363
if nothing else,
has been watered down.

37
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:19,263
Mr. wick.

38
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:49,947
Hey, buddy.

39
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:58,355
Hey.

40
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,364
Good dog.

41
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:24,348
<i> What are you doing, John?</i>

42
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,415
<i> Looking at you.</i>

43
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,517
<i> What are you doing?</i>

44
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,086
<i> I'm waiting for you.</i>

45
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:31,254
<i> Come here.</i>

46
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:48,105
Hey, boy.

47
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,232
Nice peaceful place
you got here.

48
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:18,335
Hey, aurelio.
Hey.

49
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:25,776
John, what the hell?
I thought you loved this car.

50
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:28,445
What do you think?

51
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,815
Well, your motor's
about to fall out

52
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,251
and the chassis's
all bent up,

53
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,253
the driveshaft
is all destroyed.

54
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,454
And I don't know
if you noticed,

55
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,090
but you got a crack
in your windshield.

56
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,426
I mean...
What do I think?

57
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:45,195
I could fix this.

58
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:48,565
Thanks for finding her.

59
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,267
Not a problem, man.
I just made a few calls.

60
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,468
No big deal.

61
00:17:54,338 --> 00:17:56,807
Let me know
when it's fixed.

62
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,477
All right.
It'll be ready Christmas...

63
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,812
2030.

64
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:42,379
Ciao, John.

65
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:44,748
Santino.

66
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:12,542
Good to see you.

67
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:14,744
Good to see you.

68
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,267
I was sorry to hear
about your wife, John.

69
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:40,770
Thank you.

70
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,674
Hi.

71
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,479
And the dog,
does he have a name?

72
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:51,681
No.

73
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:04,628
Listen, John,
with all sincerity...

74
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:07,931
I don't want to be here.

75
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,700
Please, don't.

76
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,769
I'm asking you
not to do this.

77
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:14,838
I'm sorry.

78
00:21:19,543 --> 00:21:23,380
No one gets out
and comes back

79
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,582
without repercussions.

80
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:30,287
I do this
with a heavy heart, John.

81
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:37,360
But remember,
if not for what I did

82
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,530
on the night
of your impossible task,

83
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:44,567
you wouldn't be here
right now, like this.

84
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,570
This is because of me.

85
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,372
This, in part, is mine.

86
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:52,375
Take it back.

87
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,477
"Take it back"?
Take it back.

88
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:58,481
A marker is no
small thing, John.

89
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,751
For a man to Grant
a marker to another,

90
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,421
is to bind a soul
to a blood oath.

91
00:22:08,492 --> 00:22:10,427
Find someone else.

92
00:22:13,964 --> 00:22:15,598
Listen to me.

93
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,901
What is this? Hmm?

94
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:21,638
Do you remember?
This is your blood.

95
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,574
You came to me.
I helped you.

96
00:22:25,676 --> 00:22:28,411
And if you don't do this,

97
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,747
you know the consequences.

98
00:22:32,783 --> 00:22:34,818
I'm not that guy anymore.

99
00:22:39,123 --> 00:22:41,391
You are always
that guy, John.

100
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:47,530
I can't help you.

101
00:22:59,643 --> 00:23:01,044
I'm sorry.

102
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:17,060
Yes. You're right.

103
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:18,928
You can't.

104
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,467
But he can.

105
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,035
I'll see you soon, John.

106
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:40,750
You have
a beautiful home, John.

107
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,789
Well, good evenin', John.

108
00:26:00,691 --> 00:26:01,958
Hey, Jimmy.

109
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:05,728
Gas leak?

110
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:09,198
Yeah, gas leak.

111
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:12,569
You workin' again?

112
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,873
I'll see you, Jimmy.

113
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:19,909
Come on, boy.

114
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,747
Good night, John.

115
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:28,651
Oh, shit.

116
00:27:11,962 --> 00:27:14,163
I'd like to see the manager.

117
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,833
How good to see you again
so soon, Mr. wick.

118
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:19,168
Shall I announce you?

119
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,304
Yes, please.

120
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:23,906
Stay.

121
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,217
Mr. wick is on his way
to see you, sir.

122
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:48,865
Impeccable.

123
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:54,003
Put these into circulation.

124
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:09,052
Where is he?

125
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:12,855
Thank you, my friend.

126
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,991
Beautiful work.
Beautiful.

127
00:28:22,132 --> 00:28:23,900
What are you doing,
Jonathan?

128
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:27,303
He burned my house down.

129
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:30,807
You rejected his marker.
You're lucky he stopped there.

130
00:28:32,076 --> 00:28:33,743
What the hell
were you thinking,

131
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:36,813
giving a marker to a man
like Santino d'Antonio?

132
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,048
It was the only way
i could get out.

133
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,051
Oh. You call this "out"?

134
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:46,122
What did you think
was gonna happen?

135
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,091
What did you expect? Huh?

136
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,828
Did you really think
this day was never
going to come? Hmm?

137
00:28:54,131 --> 00:28:55,932
What does he want you to do?

138
00:28:57,935 --> 00:28:59,268
I didn't ask.

139
00:29:00,237 --> 00:29:01,471
I just said no.

140
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:08,177
Two rules that
cannot be broken,
Jonathan.

141
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,012
No blood
on continental grounds,

142
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:13,382
and every marker
must be honored.

143
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:17,954
Now, while my judgment
comes in the form
of excommunicado,

144
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:21,090
the high table demand
a more severe outcome

145
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,159
if their traditions
are refused.

146
00:29:24,495 --> 00:29:26,295
I have no choice?

147
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:29,832
You dishonor the marker,
you die.

148
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,901
You kill the holder
of the marker, you die.

149
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,103
You run, you die.

150
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:37,840
This is what you
agreed to, Jonathan.

151
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:40,343
Do what the man asks.

152
00:29:41,812 --> 00:29:43,379
Be free.

153
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,915
Then, if you want
to go after him,

154
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,217
burn his house down,
be my guest.

155
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,552
But until then...

156
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,456
Rules.

157
00:29:54,424 --> 00:29:57,527
Exactly. Rules.

158
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,929
Without them,
we'd live with the animals.

159
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:11,040
Do you board?

160
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:14,143
I'm sorry to say, sir,
but this facility does not.

161
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:19,081
I, however,
would be willing to accept

162
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,417
the responsibility,
should you wish.

163
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,520
Appreciate that.

164
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,155
Does he have a name, sir?

165
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,924
No.

166
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,992
Good dog.

167
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,460
Stay.

168
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:38,895
This was
my father's collection.

169
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,365
I see little more than just
paint on canvas, of course.

170
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:46,569
But I do find
myself here.

171
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:49,972
Please.

172
00:32:02,953 --> 00:32:05,187
I didn't want
to do this, John.

173
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:08,658
Had you stayed retired,
i would have respected it.

174
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:13,095
Look at you.

175
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,298
You're thinkin' about it,
aren't you?

176
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:20,136
You're counting exits,
guards...

177
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,673
Could you get
to me in time?

178
00:32:26,043 --> 00:32:27,977
How would you do it,
i wonder?

179
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,147
That woman's pen?

180
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:34,617
His cane?

181
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:38,154
Maybe his glasses?

182
00:32:39,222 --> 00:32:40,690
My hands.

183
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:43,693
Ah.

184
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,162
How exciting.

185
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,997
Yet, you know you
cannot, can you?

186
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:53,035
I told you
i needed that guy,

187
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,371
the way you are looking
at me right now.

188
00:32:56,406 --> 00:32:59,041
I needed the boogeyman.

189
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:00,443
I needed John wick.

190
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,512
Just tell me what you want.

191
00:33:08,752 --> 00:33:11,420
I want you to kill my sister.

192
00:33:13,323 --> 00:33:15,124
Why?

193
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:18,227
There are 12 seats
at the high table.

194
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:22,431
Camorra, mafia,
and ndrangheta.

195
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:26,369
The Chinese, the Russian.

196
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:29,638
When my father died...

197
00:33:31,274 --> 00:33:33,409
He willed his seat to her.

198
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:38,080
She represents camorra now.

199
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,416
And I can't help but wonder

200
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:44,387
what I might accomplish
in her stead.

201
00:33:46,189 --> 00:33:51,660
You want me to kill
Gianna d'Antonio?

202
00:33:54,364 --> 00:33:55,698
I could never do it.

203
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,334
She is my blood.

204
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,369
I still love her.

205
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,104
It can't be done.

206
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:06,542
She's in Rome
for her coronation.

207
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,310
You will take
the catacombs in...

208
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:11,180
It doesn't matter
where she is.

209
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:17,353
That's why I need the ghost,
<i> lo spettro,</i> John wick.

210
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,288
That's why I need you.

211
00:34:20,357 --> 00:34:22,491
Do this for me,

212
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,493
and your marker is honored.

213
00:34:25,796 --> 00:34:27,463
What say you?

214
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:37,206
Never one to waste words.

215
00:34:53,557 --> 00:34:56,225
Fifty-nine, zero, 3.5.

216
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:00,716
Jonathan!

217
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:03,519
Julius.

218
00:37:05,555 --> 00:37:07,489
Ciao. Nice to see you.

219
00:37:13,263 --> 00:37:16,498
I fail to recall the last
time you were in Rome.

220
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:19,235
And here I'd heard

221
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:21,337
you had retired.

222
00:37:22,706 --> 00:37:25,274
I had.

223
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:28,744
Then humor me with
but one question.

224
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:39,922
No.

225
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:43,659
All right, then.

226
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:52,301
One of our finest rooms.

227
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:00,743
And enjoy your stay.

228
00:38:08,485 --> 00:38:09,551
Mr. wick.

229
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:30,506
Is the sommelier in?

230
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,308
I have never known him
not to be.

231
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:49,958
Good afternoon, Mr. wick.

232
00:38:51,528 --> 00:38:53,062
It's been a long time.

233
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,596
I'd like a tasting.

234
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:57,599
I am quite excited
to show you something.

235
00:38:59,002 --> 00:39:00,069
First...

236
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:08,477
<i> Buongiorno, signor</i> wick.

237
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,545
Ciao, Angelo.

238
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:10,979
Welcome back to Rome.

239
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:15,651
I am.

240
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,053
I know of your past fondness
for the German varietals,

241
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:22,458
but I can
wholeheartedly endorse
the new breed of Austrians.

242
00:39:23,093 --> 00:39:27,029
Glock .34 and .26.

243
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,099
This is the original map
of the d'Antonio estate.

244
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,534
Here, you have
all the ancient ruins.

245
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,941
Tell me, Mr. wick,
is this a formal event
or a social affair?

246
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,142
Social.

247
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,978
And is this for day
or evening?

248
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,381
I need one for day
and one for night.

249
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,549
Recontoured grips.

250
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,819
Flared magwell
for easier reloads.

251
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:53,055
And I know you'll appreciate
the custom porting.

252
00:39:55,992 --> 00:39:57,659
What's next?

253
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:01,430
I need something robust.
Precise.

254
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:05,401
"Robust. Precise."

255
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:10,873
This is the map of the temple
and catacombs underneath.

256
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,674
In what style?
Italian.

257
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,510
How many buttons?
Two.

258
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,044
Trousers?
Tapered.

259
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,479
How about the lining?

260
00:40:18,148 --> 00:40:19,415
Tactical.

261
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:24,153
Ar-15, 11.5-inch.

262
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,156
Compensated with
an ion-bonded bolt carrier.

263
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:30,426
Trijicon accupoint
with one-six magnification.

264
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,730
And this is
the modern blueprint.

265
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,933
There are one, two,
three gates.

266
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:43,572
Silicon carbide discs.
Ceramic matrices.

267
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,140
Accompanying laminates.

268
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:47,176
Cutting-edge body armor.

269
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:50,879
We just sew it between
the fabric and the lining.

270
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:53,582
Zero penetration.
However...

271
00:40:54,851 --> 00:40:56,618
Quite painful, I'm afraid.

272
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,988
Could you recommend anything
for the end of the night?

273
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,591
Something big, bold.

274
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:05,594
May I suggest
the Benelli m4?

275
00:41:09,966 --> 00:41:12,868
Custom bolt carrier release
and charging handle.

276
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,472
Textured grips,
should your hands get wet.

277
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:20,742
An Italian classic.

278
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:22,678
Dessert?

279
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,647
Dessert.

280
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,551
The finest cutlery.
All freshly stoned.

281
00:41:38,962 --> 00:41:40,596
Well done.

282
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,564
Could you do
a rush order?
I sure can.

283
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,533
Where would you
like to have it sent?

284
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,767
The hotel.

285
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,103
Shall I have everything
sent to your room?

286
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,606
Yes. Thank you.
Excellent.

287
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,275
Mr. wick?

288
00:41:56,913 --> 00:41:58,881
Do enjoy your party.

289
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:54,416
Good evening.

290
00:45:55,451 --> 00:45:57,319
Are you enjoying
the party?

291
00:46:45,535 --> 00:46:47,202
Mr. akoni.

292
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:54,509
Are you enjoying
the festivities?

293
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,549
Please. Sit.

294
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:06,855
Ms. d'Antonio,

295
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,957
you can't just take
what is rightfully mine.

296
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:11,359
Nothing was taken.

297
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:14,563
Those among your own came
to us with these territories.

298
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,565
A knife was pressed
to their throats.

299
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:18,967
Semantics.

300
00:47:19,569 --> 00:47:21,436
Besides...

301
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:24,973
That blade you speak of
was meant for their children.

302
00:47:26,175 --> 00:47:29,578
They were only
meant to watch.

303
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:33,381
What is yours is now ours,
Mr. akoni.

304
00:47:35,384 --> 00:47:36,585
Now go.

305
00:47:39,622 --> 00:47:41,189
Enjoy the party.

306
00:47:42,558 --> 00:47:44,226
Have some fun.

307
00:48:42,952 --> 00:48:44,185
John.

308
00:48:46,088 --> 00:48:47,289
Gianna.

309
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:55,597
There was a time
not so long ago

310
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,967
in which I considered us
as friends.

311
00:49:02,471 --> 00:49:04,005
I still do.

312
00:49:07,543 --> 00:49:08,944
Yet here you are.

313
00:49:16,085 --> 00:49:18,219
What brought you back, John?

314
00:49:19,555 --> 00:49:21,089
A marker.

315
00:49:23,092 --> 00:49:24,225
Held by?

316
00:49:26,495 --> 00:49:28,096
Your brother.

317
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:37,439
Tell me, John.

318
00:49:38,174 --> 00:49:39,641
This marker...

319
00:49:41,177 --> 00:49:42,711
Is it how you got out?

320
00:49:45,514 --> 00:49:47,582
And what was her name,

321
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:50,352
this woman whose life
has ended my own?

322
00:49:52,755 --> 00:49:54,255
Helen.

323
00:49:55,224 --> 00:49:56,424
"Helen."

324
00:49:59,462 --> 00:50:01,129
This Helen...

325
00:50:03,032 --> 00:50:06,167
Was she worth the price
that you now seek to pay?

326
00:50:13,075 --> 00:50:14,442
Now,

327
00:50:17,046 --> 00:50:20,348
let me tell you what happens
when I die.

328
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,585
Santino will lay claim
to my seat at the table.

329
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,688
He will take New York.

330
00:50:28,624 --> 00:50:33,161
And you will have been the one
who gifted it to him.

331
00:51:23,612 --> 00:51:26,081
What would your Helen
think about that, John?

332
00:51:45,301 --> 00:51:48,103
What would your Helen
think about you?

333
00:51:48,637 --> 00:51:49,804
Hmm?

334
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:06,387
Why?

335
00:52:14,263 --> 00:52:16,598
Because I lived
my life my way.

336
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,401
And I will die my way.

337
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:38,219
Do you fear damnation, John?

338
00:52:40,189 --> 00:52:41,389
Yes.

339
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:50,365
You know,

340
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:53,835
I always thought
i could escape it.

341
00:52:55,738 --> 00:52:57,839
That I'd see it coming.

342
00:53:01,477 --> 00:53:03,211
That I'd see you.

343
00:54:15,985 --> 00:54:17,385
John?

344
00:54:22,758 --> 00:54:23,958
Cassian.

345
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:27,895
You working?

346
00:54:30,432 --> 00:54:31,599
Yeah.

347
00:54:32,334 --> 00:54:33,434
You?

348
00:54:34,703 --> 00:54:35,903
Yeah.

349
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:40,575
Good night?

350
00:54:43,312 --> 00:54:44,646
Afraid so.

351
00:54:46,749 --> 00:54:48,449
I'm sorry to hear that.

352
00:57:50,232 --> 00:57:51,799
Loose ends?

353
00:57:59,174 --> 00:58:00,708
Yeah...

354
01:02:22,938 --> 01:02:24,338
You're not havin'
a good night,
are you, John?

355
01:04:50,952 --> 01:04:52,019
Gentlemen!

356
01:04:53,955 --> 01:04:55,256
Gentlemen!

357
01:05:07,369 --> 01:05:09,503
Do I need to remind you

358
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:10,971
that there will be
no business

359
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:13,107
conducted on
the continental grounds?

360
01:05:15,076 --> 01:05:16,143
No,<i> signore.</i>

361
01:05:17,245 --> 01:05:18,512
No, sir.

362
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:26,520
Now, may I suggest
a visit to the bar,

363
01:05:27,689 --> 01:05:29,323
so you can calm yourselves.

364
01:05:33,628 --> 01:05:35,329
Gin, wasn't it?

365
01:05:36,264 --> 01:05:37,464
Yes.

366
01:05:39,067 --> 01:05:41,268
Bourbon, right?

367
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:44,405
Yeah.

368
01:06:11,032 --> 01:06:12,499
I had a marker.

369
01:06:14,502 --> 01:06:15,703
Whose?

370
01:06:16,738 --> 01:06:18,372
Her brother.

371
01:06:23,445 --> 01:06:24,645
I see.

372
01:06:26,314 --> 01:06:28,115
You had no choice.

373
01:06:32,687 --> 01:06:35,222
He wants her seat
at the table.

374
01:06:36,725 --> 01:06:38,525
He'll get it now.

375
01:06:41,463 --> 01:06:42,663
Yeah.

376
01:06:44,332 --> 01:06:45,532
Yeah.

377
01:06:48,069 --> 01:06:49,536
So you're free.

378
01:06:56,378 --> 01:06:57,578
Am I?

379
01:07:00,148 --> 01:07:01,248
No.

380
01:07:03,151 --> 01:07:04,518
Not at all.

381
01:07:06,755 --> 01:07:10,624
You killed my ward.
Someone I was close to.

382
01:07:13,495 --> 01:07:15,162
An eye for an eye, John.

383
01:07:16,598 --> 01:07:18,265
You know how it goes.

384
01:07:20,535 --> 01:07:21,635
Yeah.

385
01:07:28,043 --> 01:07:29,676
I'll make it quick.

386
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:32,413
I promise.

387
01:07:34,315 --> 01:07:36,116
I appreciate that.

388
01:07:37,252 --> 01:07:39,319
I'll try and do the same.

389
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,097
This round's on me.

390
01:07:53,301 --> 01:07:55,636
Consider it
a professional courtesy.

391
01:08:29,571 --> 01:08:31,505
No. Thanks.

392
01:09:34,636 --> 01:09:36,703
<i> Hello, John.</i>

393
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:39,206
<i> I understand if you are upset.</i>

394
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:41,842
<i> And I know it might</i>
<i> feel personal.</i>

395
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,344
<i> But what kind of man</i>
<i> would I be</i>

396
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:45,679
<i> if I didn't avenge</i>
<i> my sister's murder?</i>

397
01:09:47,882 --> 01:09:49,283
John?

398
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,334
Could you let
management know

399
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:09,469
I'll be checking out
in the morning.

400
01:10:47,709 --> 01:10:50,777
Operator. How may
i direct your call?

401
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:52,779
- Accounts payable.
<i>- One moment, please.</i>

402
01:11:05,827 --> 01:11:07,861
Accounts payable.
How may I help you?

403
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:09,329
<i> I'd like</i>
<i> to open an account.</i>

404
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:11,732
Name on the account?
John wick.

405
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:13,533
<i> Verification?</i>

406
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:15,469
<i> 9305-05.</i>

407
01:11:16,938 --> 01:11:19,006
<i> State of contract?</i>

408
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:21,475
Open.
<i> Denomination?</i>

409
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:24,645
Seven million.

410
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:26,446
Processing. Please hold.

411
01:11:30,018 --> 01:11:32,486
I appreciate
the service.
My pleasure.

412
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:34,688
You will find
safe passage below.

413
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,494
Transportation is
waiting for you.

414
01:11:41,963 --> 01:11:46,366
May you have
a safe journey, Mr. wick.

415
01:13:17,992 --> 01:13:19,126
Order confirmed.

416
01:13:22,797 --> 01:13:25,098
What is this?
He completed the task.

417
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:28,602
The marker is over.

418
01:13:29,437 --> 01:13:30,871
Mark it.

419
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:34,141
If Mr. wick
isn't dead already,

420
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:35,442
he soon will be.

421
01:13:38,045 --> 01:13:40,881
Will you mark it, sir?

422
01:13:54,195 --> 01:13:58,165
You have no idea
what's coming, do you?

423
01:14:00,001 --> 01:14:03,437
I have everyone
in New York looking for him.

424
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,772
I doubt
we will see him again.

425
01:14:08,576 --> 01:14:09,943
Do you now?

426
01:14:11,779 --> 01:14:14,781
You stabbed the devil
in the back

427
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,851
and forced him back
into the life
that he had just left.

428
01:14:19,821 --> 01:14:22,656
You incinerated
the priest's temple.

429
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:23,857
Burned it to the ground.

430
01:14:25,593 --> 01:14:28,929
Now he's free of the marker,
what do you think he'll do?

431
01:14:31,632 --> 01:14:34,201
<i> He had a glimpse</i>
<i> of the other side</i>

432
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:35,902
<i> and he embraced it.</i>

433
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:37,838
<i> But you,</i> signor<i> d'Antonio...</i>

434
01:14:39,006 --> 01:14:40,173
...took it away from him.

435
01:14:41,108 --> 01:14:42,742
He was already back.

436
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:45,479
Oh, he came back for love,
not for you.

437
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,882
He owed me.
I had every right.

438
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:51,952
And now he's coming again.

439
01:14:54,088 --> 01:14:55,622
<i> He did tell you</i>
<i> not to do this.</i>

440
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,160
He did warn you.

441
01:19:07,942 --> 01:19:12,011
<i> Please notify mta personnel</i>
<i> of any suspicious activity.</i>

442
01:19:19,954 --> 01:19:22,055
<i> Your attention, please.</i>

443
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:25,291
<i> The broad street bound</i>
<i> c train is now arriving.</i>

444
01:19:26,927 --> 01:19:28,428
<i> Your attention, please.</i>

445
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,898
<i> The broad street bound</i>
<i> c train is now arriving.</i>

446
01:19:45,246 --> 01:19:47,447
<i> Next stop, canal street.</i>

447
01:20:08,102 --> 01:20:09,803
<i> This is canal street.</i>

448
01:20:12,006 --> 01:20:15,508
<i> This is the broad street</i>
<i> bound c train.</i>

449
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:18,044
<i> The next stop</i>
<i> is rector street.</i>

450
01:20:43,103 --> 01:20:45,171
<i> This is rector street.</i>

451
01:20:50,277 --> 01:20:53,079
<i> This is the broad street</i>
<i> bound c train.</i>

452
01:20:54,048 --> 01:20:56,349
<i> The next stop is broad street.</i>

453
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,701
<i> This is broad street.</i>

454
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:24,637
<i> This is the last stop</i>
<i> on the southbound c train.</i>

455
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:27,040
The blade is in your aorta.

456
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:30,143
You pull it out,
you'll bleed,
and you will die.

457
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:31,611
<i> This is the end of the line.</i>

458
01:22:35,115 --> 01:22:37,483
Consider this
a professional courtesy.

459
01:22:38,552 --> 01:22:40,486
<i> This is broad street.</i>

460
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:43,623
<i> This is the last stop</i>
<i> on the southbound c train.</i>

461
01:22:45,559 --> 01:22:47,493
<i> This is the end of the line.</i>

462
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:26,599
We say things,
we see things.

463
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:30,336
The things you see
are nightmares, man.

464
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:32,238
Like this one time...

465
01:23:35,442 --> 01:23:37,110
Take me to him.

466
01:23:40,214 --> 01:23:42,248
Tell him it's John wick.

467
01:23:58,298 --> 01:24:01,334
You know, they just...
They put it in everything!

468
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:03,269
Hey, man. You got a quarter?

469
01:25:54,314 --> 01:25:56,249
As I live and breathe!

470
01:25:57,317 --> 01:25:58,918
John wick.

471
01:25:59,753 --> 01:26:00,820
The man.

472
01:26:01,722 --> 01:26:03,389
The myth.

473
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:06,425
The legend.

474
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:08,494
You're not very good
at retiring.

475
01:26:09,296 --> 01:26:12,231
I'm workin' on it.

476
01:26:12,233 --> 01:26:15,635
Mr. wick doesn't remember,
but we met many years ago,

477
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:17,537
before my ascension...

478
01:26:18,772 --> 01:26:21,440
When I was just
a pawn in the game.

479
01:26:23,343 --> 01:26:25,912
We met and
you gave me a gift,

480
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:27,780
the gift that would
make me a king.

481
01:26:30,384 --> 01:26:33,586
You don't remember,
but there I was,
standing in an alleyway.

482
01:26:35,222 --> 01:26:36,822
I didn't even
hear you comin'.

483
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,695
You gave me this.

484
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,535
Gift from the boogeyman.

485
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:52,205
Perfect for every occasion.

486
01:26:54,675 --> 01:26:57,944
But you also gave me a choice.

487
01:26:57,946 --> 01:27:01,881
Pull my gun,
shoot you in the back,
and die.

488
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,317
Or keep the pressure
on my neck...

489
01:27:05,752 --> 01:27:06,819
...and live.

490
01:27:09,223 --> 01:27:12,225
And so you see,
i survived.

491
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:17,230
No one sneaks up
on me anymore,
thanks to you.

492
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:20,700
I am all-seeing
and all-knowing.

493
01:27:22,603 --> 01:27:24,804
Then you know
why I'm here.

494
01:27:25,973 --> 01:27:30,276
Santino d'Antonio, yes.

495
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:32,612
Your contract went wide, John.

496
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:36,549
That's bad for your health.

497
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,284
What's the number
up to now, Earl?

498
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:43,990
$7 million! Damn!

499
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:46,926
It's Christmas. We're going
to applebee's after this.

500
01:27:50,831 --> 01:27:53,032
I need your help.

501
01:27:53,034 --> 01:27:56,902
You have eyes begging
for change on every corner
in the city.

502
01:27:56,904 --> 01:28:00,406
I'm thinkin'
you can find Santino.

503
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:03,442
I need you to move me.
Underground.

504
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:05,611
Get me to him.

505
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:09,015
How sweet it is!

506
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:11,817
The boogeyman
begging me for help.

507
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:13,686
Well, of course, John.

508
01:28:13,688 --> 01:28:16,422
Yes, John.
Whatever you'd like, John.

509
01:28:16,424 --> 01:28:19,292
Would you like a back rub
with that, John?

510
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,861
You're going to help me.

511
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:25,431
Why the fuck
would I do that?

512
01:28:26,967 --> 01:28:29,568
Because I'm the only one
that can help you.

513
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:50,656
You're gonna help me out?

514
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:54,627
That's downright
upright of you, Mr. wick.

515
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:56,996
You sound positively
magnanimous.

516
01:28:58,899 --> 01:29:00,666
But look around you.

517
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:04,337
How much help does it
look like I need?

518
01:29:13,347 --> 01:29:17,416
It seems to me that
the real question,
Mr. wick,

519
01:29:17,418 --> 01:29:21,487
is who in
this cruel world of ours
is going to help you?

520
01:29:36,436 --> 01:29:37,970
There's a storm coming.

521
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:41,440
Not just for me.
For all of us.

522
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:43,843
For everyone
under the table.

523
01:29:43,845 --> 01:29:45,978
Yes, killing someone
who has a seat
at the high table

524
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:47,713
does create a problem.

525
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:49,749
But it's your problem, baby.

526
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:55,121
After all, none of my people
sent Gianna d'Antonio

527
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,922
to the hereafter.

528
01:29:58,458 --> 01:30:02,461
That being said,
Santino has her seat now.

529
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:05,598
And he wants the city.

530
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:09,668
When he's done uptown,
you think he's gonna
stop at 14th street?

531
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:12,738
We'll just have
to take care of ourselves.

532
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:15,674
Oh, yeah?
For how long?

533
01:30:16,543 --> 01:30:17,877
And how much blood?

534
01:30:18,745 --> 01:30:20,646
You kill Santino,

535
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:23,115
the camorra,
and the high table
come for you.

536
01:30:24,484 --> 01:30:27,686
I kill Santino,
they come for me.

537
01:30:29,022 --> 01:30:32,758
He's offered $7 million
for your life.

538
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:37,096
$7 million is a lot
of money, Mr. wick.

539
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:45,571
So I guess
you have a choice.

540
01:30:46,173 --> 01:30:48,040
You want a war?

541
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:50,576
Or do you wanna
just give me a gun?

542
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:05,991
Somebody, please!
Get this man a gun!

543
01:31:12,699 --> 01:31:15,668
Kimber 1911, .45 acp.

544
01:31:17,938 --> 01:31:20,606
Seven-round capacity.

545
01:31:29,015 --> 01:31:31,150
Seven rounds?

546
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:34,954
$7 million gets you
seven rounds.

547
01:31:36,223 --> 01:31:38,624
That's a million dollars
a round, baby.

548
01:31:50,170 --> 01:31:51,270
Let's go.

549
01:31:52,839 --> 01:31:55,641
Your descent into hell
begins here, Mr. wick.

550
01:31:55,643 --> 01:31:57,510
He's at the museum.

551
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:58,711
Earl will guide you.

552
01:31:58,713 --> 01:32:00,946
Do be careful
on your way down.

553
01:32:02,215 --> 01:32:05,985
Oh, and remember,
you owe me.

554
01:32:07,654 --> 01:32:09,555
You don't want me
owing you.

555
01:32:39,553 --> 01:32:40,953
Welcome, everyone.

556
01:32:40,955 --> 01:32:44,056
Let us toast to the future
of the high table

557
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:47,159
and of course,
to the memory of
my dear sister.

558
01:33:04,578 --> 01:33:06,178
Nice to see you.

559
01:33:16,089 --> 01:33:17,890
Mr. akoni, how are you?

560
01:34:14,381 --> 01:34:16,215
Wick is here.

561
01:34:16,217 --> 01:34:17,282
Yeah.

562
01:35:08,968 --> 01:35:11,370
You and you, with me.
You, go.

563
01:36:26,846 --> 01:36:31,917
<i> Welcome to</i>
<i> "reflections of the soul"</i>
<i> at the new modern NYC.</i>

564
01:36:33,253 --> 01:36:35,087
<i> Within this exhibition,</i>

565
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:38,357
<i> the interplay of light</i>
<i> and the nature of self-images</i>

566
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:41,126
<i> coalesce to provide</i>
<i> an experience</i>

567
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:42,895
<i> which will highlight</i>
<i> the fragility</i>

568
01:36:42,897 --> 01:36:46,865
<i> of our perception of space</i>
<i> and our place within it.</i>

569
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:50,068
<i> We hope through this exhibit</i>
<i> we can provide new insights</i>

570
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:52,137
<i> into your understanding</i>
<i> of the world,</i>

571
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:55,841
<i> and just possibly lead you</i>
<i> to deeper reflection</i>

572
01:36:55,843 --> 01:36:57,342
<i> into the nature of self.</i>

573
01:37:12,325 --> 01:37:15,294
The marker
is complete, John.

574
01:37:15,296 --> 01:37:17,062
You should have
just run away.

575
01:37:27,473 --> 01:37:29,908
You know what the camorra
will do to you.

576
01:37:31,411 --> 01:37:33,412
You think
you're old testament?

577
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:35,881
No, John.

578
01:37:38,218 --> 01:37:39,351
No.

579
01:37:41,554 --> 01:37:43,388
Killing me won't
stop the contract.

580
01:37:45,225 --> 01:37:49,161
Killing me will make it
so much worse.

581
01:37:52,098 --> 01:37:53,298
John,

582
01:37:54,567 --> 01:37:55,968
you know what I think?

583
01:37:58,438 --> 01:38:00,973
I think you are
addicted to it.

584
01:38:00,975 --> 01:38:02,040
To the vengeance.

585
01:38:20,026 --> 01:38:25,597
<i> Welcome to</i>
<i> "reflections of the soul"</i>
<i> at the new modern NYC.</i>

586
01:38:28,368 --> 01:38:29,568
No wife.

587
01:38:31,271 --> 01:38:32,604
No life.

588
01:38:35,008 --> 01:38:36,074
No home.

589
01:38:37,243 --> 01:38:40,913
Vengeance,
it's all you have.

590
01:38:42,315 --> 01:38:44,583
You wanted me back.

591
01:38:45,585 --> 01:38:46,685
I'm back.

592
01:41:42,829 --> 01:41:48,767
<i> You are now exiting</i>
<i> "reflections of the soul"</i>
<i> at the new modern NYC.</i>

593
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:51,169
<i> We hope that your journey</i>
<i> through the exhibit</i>

594
01:41:51,171 --> 01:41:54,306
<i> has been one of</i>
<i> reflective contemplation</i>

595
01:41:54,308 --> 01:41:56,541
<i> allowing for a new</i>
<i> perspective and insight.</i>

596
01:42:01,314 --> 01:42:04,616
<i> You are now exiting</i>
<i> "reflections of the soul..."</i>

597
01:43:24,263 --> 01:43:27,599
<i> You are now exiting</i>
<i> "reflections of the soul..."</i>

598
01:43:40,546 --> 01:43:42,214
Good evening.

599
01:43:43,783 --> 01:43:45,584
Is the manager in?

600
01:43:45,586 --> 01:43:48,520
The manager is always in.

601
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:55,560
Winston.

602
01:43:56,696 --> 01:43:58,964
Mr. d'Antonio.

603
01:43:58,966 --> 01:44:01,833
Your evening has
been colorful, I see.

604
01:44:01,835 --> 01:44:05,370
Seeking safe harbor,
i presume?

605
01:44:05,372 --> 01:44:07,739
I want his membership
revoked. Now.

606
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:09,474
In the eyes
of this institution,

607
01:44:09,476 --> 01:44:12,277
Mr. wick has breached
no legalities.

608
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:14,446
Then you know
that I have the right
to demand of you...

609
01:44:14,448 --> 01:44:18,683
Nothing. You demand nothing
of me, Mr. d'Antonio.

610
01:44:18,685 --> 01:44:21,553
This kingdom is mine
and mine alone.

611
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:26,324
All right.

612
01:44:26,326 --> 01:44:29,628
Then enjoy your kingdom,
Winston, while you still can.

613
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:32,731
And you
its privileges, sir.

614
01:44:45,878 --> 01:44:48,413
I'm here to see
Santino d'Antonio.

615
01:44:52,451 --> 01:44:54,719
He's waiting for you
in the lounge, sir.

616
01:45:46,072 --> 01:45:47,939
Duck fat.

617
01:45:47,941 --> 01:45:49,808
Makes all the difference.

618
01:45:49,810 --> 01:45:51,476
Jonathan...

619
01:45:51,478 --> 01:45:52,644
Have you seen
the menu here?

620
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:56,881
Lot of options.
Jonathan,
listen to me...

621
01:45:56,883 --> 01:46:00,452
A man can stay here
a long time

622
01:46:00,454 --> 01:46:02,787
and never eat
the same meal twice.

623
01:46:02,789 --> 01:46:05,857
Jonathan,
just walk away.

624
01:46:08,427 --> 01:46:09,494
Yeah, Jonathan.

625
01:46:10,696 --> 01:46:11,763
Walk...

626
01:46:18,971 --> 01:46:20,972
What have you done?

627
01:46:24,944 --> 01:46:26,010
Finished it.

628
01:46:44,530 --> 01:46:46,464
How was he?

629
01:46:46,466 --> 01:46:49,401
He was a good dog.
I have enjoyed
his company.

630
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:55,740
Let's go home.

631
01:48:32,705 --> 01:48:34,038
Mr. wick?

632
01:48:40,546 --> 01:48:42,747
If you would be
so inclined.

633
01:49:17,149 --> 01:49:18,249
Come on, boy.

634
01:49:26,792 --> 01:49:29,160
It has been
a pleasure, Mr. wick.

635
01:49:36,101 --> 01:49:37,635
Goodbye.

636
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:16,107
Jonathan.

637
01:50:16,109 --> 01:50:17,308
Winston.

638
01:50:18,978 --> 01:50:20,278
What am I lookin' at?

639
01:50:22,648 --> 01:50:25,083
The camorra's doubled
Santino's open contract.

640
01:50:25,085 --> 01:50:26,351
It's gone international.

641
01:50:27,686 --> 01:50:28,953
High table?

642
01:50:28,955 --> 01:50:30,021
Mmm-hmm.

643
01:50:31,657 --> 01:50:32,757
And the continental?

644
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:36,894
You killed a man
on company grounds,
Jonathan.

645
01:50:36,896 --> 01:50:40,264
You leave me no choice but
to declare you excommunicado.

646
01:50:42,368 --> 01:50:46,304
The doors to any service
or provider in connection
with the continental

647
01:50:46,306 --> 01:50:48,339
are now closed to you.

648
01:50:52,244 --> 01:50:53,911
I am so sorry.

649
01:50:56,281 --> 01:50:58,349
Your life is now forfeit.

650
01:51:00,986 --> 01:51:02,987
Then why am I not dead?

651
01:51:04,223 --> 01:51:06,758
Because I deemed it
not to be.

652
01:51:09,828 --> 01:51:10,895
Now.

653
01:51:38,357 --> 01:51:41,759
You have one hour.
I can't delay it any longer.

654
01:51:43,362 --> 01:51:44,962
You might need this...

655
01:51:47,132 --> 01:51:48,199
Down the road.

656
01:51:52,738 --> 01:51:53,805
Winston...

657
01:51:55,107 --> 01:51:56,441
Tell them.

658
01:51:57,476 --> 01:51:59,744
Tell them all.

659
01:51:59,746 --> 01:52:01,813
Whoever comes,

660
01:52:01,815 --> 01:52:03,147
whoever it is,

661
01:52:04,183 --> 01:52:05,850
I'll kill them.

662
01:52:06,485 --> 01:52:07,885
I'll kill them all.

663
01:52:12,091 --> 01:52:13,458
'Course you will.

664
01:52:17,996 --> 01:52:19,297
Jonathan.

665
01:52:21,233 --> 01:52:22,767
Winston.

666
01:52:45,357 --> 01:52:46,891
Accounts payable.

667
01:52:49,394 --> 01:52:53,464
One-one-one-one-one.

668
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:57,435
In one hour.

669
01:52:58,237 --> 01:52:59,437
John wick.

670
01:53:01,106 --> 01:53:03,107
Excommunicado.

671
01:53:26,832 --> 01:53:30,168
Order 11111 confirmed.
