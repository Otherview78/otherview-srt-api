1
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,784
Mom, you said ten minutes.

2
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:58,620
No, I said when I've warmed up.

3
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:01,355
-Mom.
-Agnes, indoor voice.

4
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:02,690
We're not indoors.

5
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:05,125
Yes, but there are
other guests here.

6
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:12,132
Hey.

7
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,537
Is this chair free?

8
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:19,907
Um, yeah, sure.

9
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:22,610
Oh. Super. Super.

10
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,825
<i>-Signore.</i>
-Oh, thank you. <i>Grazie.</i>

11
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,662
That's for you, kid.
Get it down your neck.

12
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:43,163
-Thank you.
-Cheers, my dears. To us.

13
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,536
Oh, we're on our holiday now.

14
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,737
You want a beer?

15
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,608
It's a little early.

16
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:56,309
-But if you want one.
-Nah.

17
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,714
Come on. We are getting in it.

18
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,420
Please don't give Agnes
any apple juice before bed.

19
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,823
<i>-Sì, signora.</i>
-And you've got Hoppy?

20
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,558
-Mm.
-You got my number?

21
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,292
<i>-Sì.</i>
-Okay.

22
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,861
-Love you, sweetheart.
-Love you.

23
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:15,262
Okay. Bye.

24
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,397
-Bye.
<i>-Ciao.</i>

25
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:19,634
I swear, that bunny.

26
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,435
We need to stage
an intervention.

27
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,838
And start World War Three?

28
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,740
Look, she's with a stranger
in a strange place,

29
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:27,975
-and he makes her feel safe.
-Yeah, well, she's 11.

30
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:31,378
♪ If everybody wants you ♪

31
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,647
♪ Why isn't anybody... ♪

32
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,981
Ben.

33
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,985
Can we agree not to sit next
to the Danish couple this eve?

34
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:39,721
If I have to hear
one more word about their

35
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:41,589
"cooking class."

36
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,558
Today,
we made the ravioli con funghi.

37
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:45,325
You should come
to the class tomorrow,

38
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,695
because I believe
they're making the gnocchi.

39
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,362
-Mm.
-Oh, it's gonna be great.

40
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,532
And you will love Giorgio,
who teaches us.

41
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,768
He knows everything
about Italian food,

42
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:57,605
and he even invented some
variations of these courses.

43
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,574
You know,
there's 23 different...

44
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,342
<i>Geez. 46 euros for risotto?</i>

45
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,544
<i>-Dad.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

46
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:05,412
Agnes, keep your voice down.

47
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,014
I can't, I can't find Hoppy.

48
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:09,016
Okay, honey.
Let's calm down, okay?

49
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,718
Did you leave him
in the car or...?

50
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:12,687
No. No, I think
I had him at the church.

51
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,822
All right, all right. Don't
worry. We'll find him, okay?

52
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:16,724
-All right?
-It's okay. Baby, it's okay.

53
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:18,025
Here, Daddy's gonna find him.
Come on, let's go sit down.

54
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:19,560
-Let's do some...
-Louise, come on.

55
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:20,628
Ben, I can't handle
another meltdown, okay?

56
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,329
Louise, I'm...

57
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:25,465
Come on. Let's sit down.
Let's do some breathing.

58
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,869
-Fucking bunny.
-Okay. Breathe in.

59
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:30,738
One, two, three.

60
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:31,939
Hold.

61
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:33,373
One...

62
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,551
<i>Coniglio?</i> No? <i>C-Coniglio?</i>

63
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:44,786
No.

64
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,053
<i>Grazie. Grazie.</i>

65
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:54,061
Whoops, sorry. Whoa!

66
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,463
Oh. It's so bumpy.

67
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,533
Watch out, watch out,
watch out.

68
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:12,345
Ah!

69
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,848
Oh, Dad, look,
they found Hoppy.

70
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,883
-Great. -Oh, yeah, Ant, he
recognized him from the hotel.

71
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,685
Oh, this is my husband Ben.

72
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,787
Yeah, I-I think
I stole your lounger.

73
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:21,589
-Ah, yeah.
-Yeah.

74
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,858
I'm Patrick Field.
This is my wife Ciara.

75
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:24,892
-Hello. Hi.
-Hey.

76
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:26,594
And, uh, you must be Ant.

77
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,696
Oh, Ant has
some trouble communicating,

78
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,363
so he can be a bit insecure.

79
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:31,599
-Hi, Ant.
-That's fine.

80
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,634
-This is Agnes.
-And this is Hoppy.

81
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,703
He's my worry bunny.
He smells really nice.

82
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,805
-Oh. -Aw.
-Nice Vespa.

83
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,775
Yeah, isn't she? We got her
from Paulo on the front desk.

84
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,710
-Oh. -It's an absolute blast.
You should try.

85
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,545
-Oh, no.
-Can we? Please, Dad?

86
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,047
-Honey, honey, please.
-Oh, wh-what, you don't ride?

87
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,882
-I mean, I can take you.
-Yeah.

88
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,151
-Uh, do you have helmets?
-I-I promise,

89
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,752
I'll-I'll be
really, really safe.

90
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:53,855
-But legally...
-I won't call the fun police

91
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:55,022
if you don't.

92
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:56,924
Come on, please?

93
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,794
Oh, it's hard
to say no, isn't it?

94
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:00,862
Uh, okay.

95
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:02,964
-Okay, give me your...
-Yes. -Yay.

96
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:04,431
Uh, just hold on tight, okay?

97
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,633
Yeah.

98
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,934
-All right, you holding on?
-Yeah.

99
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:08,569
All right, we'll go
nice and slow, okay?

100
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:09,604
-Yes.
-See you guys in a sec.

101
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:10,738
-Hold on tight.
-See ya.

102
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,607
-Bye!
-Here we go. Bye.

103
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,508
She's doing all right.

104
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,043
She's a natural!

105
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:17,410
Ooh.

106
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,414
No, she'll be fine.

107
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,161
Whoa!

108
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:35,930
That was a bit crazy. Oh!

109
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,865
Nailed it.

110
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,567
Yeah.

111
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,935
-That was so much fun.
-Yeah? -You did great.

112
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,637
-Say thank you to Mr. Field.
-Thank you.

113
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,471
-Oh, no. Paddy, please.
-Thank you, Paddy.

114
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:45,806
You got it. Anytime.

115
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,775
So, listen,
have you guys eaten lunch yet?

116
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:48,743
Uh, no, we, uh...

117
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,678
No? We were thinking
we were gonna hang out

118
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,179
with that really interesting
Danish couple.

119
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,481
-You know the ones?
-Uh...

120
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:55,750
-I'm j-just messing around.
-Oh.

121
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:58,052
But, uh, seriously,

122
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,655
there is a really nice place
around the corner.

123
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:02,089
So we make the decision

124
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,624
that we're gonna move to London.

125
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:04,892
Fly over, find an apartment,

126
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:06,894
you know, I'm hiring
great new people,

127
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:08,663
and then...

128
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:10,463
Global economy tanks.

129
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,199
I get a call from Chicago.

130
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:15,503
"Uh, Ben, about that UK office
we wanted you to set up."

131
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,571
Aw, man, that's got to be
a kick in the balls.

132
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:19,240
Yeah. They gave me
a good severance.

133
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,676
Yeah? That's redundancy.

134
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,476
And, Louise, do you work?

135
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,546
I do. Yeah.

136
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,682
Uh, I'm, uh, I'm in PR.

137
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:29,850
Or I-I was. I am--

138
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:31,852
I, um...

139
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:34,855
I don't have quite
the-the same network in London.

140
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,925
Yeah, we're still
finding our way.

141
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,995
But we've decided to stay
in London because we love it.

142
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,164
We're two hours from here
or Paris or Rome.

143
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,066
The West Country.

144
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,202
-I don't think we've made it
out there yet. -Uh-uh.

145
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,704
What? Oh, my.

146
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,138
Right, that's it, then.

147
00:07:51,172 --> 00:07:52,773
You have to come and visit.
Really, it's beautiful.

148
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,575
Yeah, that'd be great.

149
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:55,810
Yeah?

150
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,179
Yeah.

151
00:07:58,212 --> 00:07:59,714
Done.

152
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:02,550
-Well, all right, then.
-So what do you got?

153
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,718
You got another job
lined up or...?

154
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,186
Well, I'm still processing.

155
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:08,222
Look, I remember,
before I quit my practice, I--

156
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,857
-What was I like?
-Uh, miserable.

157
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,658
I was miserable.

158
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,860
-You're a lawyer?
-No, doctor. -Oh.

159
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,595
But now,
do a little bit of work

160
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,130
-with <i>Médecins Sans Frontières,</i>
and I'm... -He is...

161
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,965
-Oh, wow. -Wow.
-He is so much happier.

162
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:19,567
I'm so much happier.

163
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,703
Anyway, this tagliata
is delicious.

164
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:24,705
How's your polenta?
Looks a bit dry.

165
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:26,040
No, it's fine.

166
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,308
So you're a vegetarian?

167
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:30,311
For animal welfare
or personal health?

168
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,846
Yeah, for-for health benefits

169
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,014
and the animal welfare
and the environment.

170
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:34,215
No, no, no.
You don't have to go on.

171
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:35,616
It's-it's the future.

172
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,685
Mom, can we go play
on the swing?

173
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,086
-Uh, yeah.
-Don't you want a dessert?

174
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,888
No, no, she's already had
her ice cream for the day.

175
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,590
Oh, wow, you guys are tough.

176
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:45,292
Ant, you can play, but stay
where we can see you, okay?

177
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:46,894
And don't disturb anyone, okay?

178
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,030
Oh, that's all right.
The Italians love children.

179
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:50,898
Not like the French.

180
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,868
It's so great for Ant
to find a friend to play with.

181
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,302
At the hotel,
the other families' kids,

182
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:57,171
they all seem
to know each other.

183
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,706
And, well, Ant struggles.

184
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,341
-Um...
-Could I?

185
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,177
He, um, he has a condition.

186
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,812
Congenital aglossia.

187
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,313
Um, laymen's terms,

188
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:09,050
he was born with a much smaller
tongue than you or I.

189
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,218
-Makes it hard for him
to communicate. -Ah. -Mm.

190
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:14,055
But look, these two,
they're getting on great guns.

191
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:16,590
Shame they can't stay
this age forever.

192
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:17,992
Oh, shit.

193
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,194
-The Danes.
-Oh, no.

194
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,729
Hey.

195
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,798
He's seen us.
He's totally seen us.

196
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:25,332
Oy. Go with me on this.

197
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:26,367
Torsten.

198
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,202
-Yeah. Hi.
-Hey.

199
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,870
-Hey, have you guys eaten?
-No, we haven't.

200
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,872
Do you want to come join us?

201
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,841
Actually, we could use
your help with a, uh,

202
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,209
-quite important debate.
-Yeah.

203
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,678
Sorry.
This food is so rich.

204
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,246
We're debating
toilet paper protocols.

205
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,584
So, uh, to scrunch or to fold.
What do you do?

206
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,155
Uh...

207
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:49,156
I don't know.

208
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,391
Oh, all right.

209
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,326
Well, Louise is fold,
Ciara is scrunch,

210
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,328
but, you see, Ben and I,
we worry that if you fold,

211
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,964
you risk a puncture and you get
a bit of poo on your finger.

212
00:09:56,997 --> 00:10:00,101
So, what should we do,
get another three chairs?

213
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:01,969
No, no, we were
actually just looking

214
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,971
to make a reservation
for later, so...

215
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,973
Oh, all right, man. Um, okay.

216
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,209
Well, see you guys
back at the ranch.

217
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,344
Yeah.

218
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,713
-Bye, then.
-Cheers.

219
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:13,881
What?

220
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,282
Paddy, you're terrible.

221
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:17,384
-Terrible. -You do not know
the half of it.

222
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:24,091
A hundred percent, sure.

223
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,394
Was it last year or
the year before we went there?

224
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:28,896
Oh, yeah.

225
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,699
Oh, Torsten, you haven't said.
Fold or scrunch?

226
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,100
Oh, man.

227
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,668
I know. I'm really sor--
I'm really sorry.

228
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:35,803
Anyway, sorry, mate.

229
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,338
Here we go.

230
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:41,775
<i>Tre, due, uno.</i>

231
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,283
To new friends.

232
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,085
To new friends.

233
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,959
Oh, God.

234
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:00,327
Remind me why we live
in London again.

235
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:02,897
Come on. Go inside. Let's go.

236
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,380
All right.

237
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,315
Good night, honey.

238
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,983
And Hoppy.

239
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,789
Hon, you remember our agreement?

240
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,825
Hoppy gets his own room
before Christmas.

241
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:36,096
Right?
You're almost 12 years old.

242
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:39,800
Love you.

243
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,769
I love you, too.

244
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:51,745
I don't think Hoppy's getting
his own room before Christmas.

245
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,915
I mean, Louise,
do you think we should worry

246
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:57,151
-about why the...
-Ben, would you...

247
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,253
She'll hear you.

248
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:02,022
It's probably better
that she does.

249
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:07,828
Are you okay?

250
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:11,398
I got a call from
the headhunter today.

251
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:13,467
I didn't get it.

252
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,135
Oh.

253
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,972
Honey, I'm sorry.

254
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:25,980
-It's Penny.
-Mm.

255
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:27,815
Agnes's math tutor.
You want to read it?

256
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,250
No.

257
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:31,252
Goddamn.

258
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,857
Uh, look who wrote us.

259
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,292
Your friend.

260
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:46,133
"Ciao, Ben and Louise.

261
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,536
"We so miss our amazing week
together in Italy.

262
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,039
"You really must come visit
the farm. What do you say?

263
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:55,109
"A long weekend of Devon air,
fresh food and long walks.

264
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,144
"Ant sends Agnes good vibes.

265
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,946
He really misses her."

266
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,247
Very sweet.

267
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:01,782
Hey.

268
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,352
Maybe this will be good for her.

269
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:08,289
Uh, for us.
You know, change of scenery.

270
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:11,292
Yeah.

271
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:15,362
It's maybe a bit long to spend
with people we barely know.

272
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:16,930
Yeah.

273
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,966
You're probably right.

274
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:23,404
Anyways.

275
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:26,307
You know what?

276
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,042
I think we should go.

277
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,178
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Be fun.

278
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,846
Yeah?

279
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,959
Oh, gosh.

280
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:53,067
Look at that.

281
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,869
Yeah. Look at that.

282
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,149
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>we didn't miss the turn or...</i>

283
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:12,520
Well, I don't know. We haven't
seen the-the war memorial yet.

284
00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:15,422
Ben, please don't get angry.

285
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:18,859
I'm not angry.

286
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:22,463
C-Can you call them
or-or ask or...

287
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:25,999
There's still no...

288
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:27,602
Oh.

289
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:29,637
<i>Oh. War memorial!</i>

290
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:31,138
<i>Left. Left, left, left.</i>

291
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,518
-Baby.
-Hmm?

292
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:45,319
We're here.

293
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,435
Get me out of this car.

294
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,172
-Hey! -Hey!
-Hey!

295
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,674
-You made it.
-Hi.

296
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,142
We thought you were lost.

297
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:09,276
-Oh, no. -Ah. Well,
we thought we were lost.

298
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,178
-No, we didn't.
-Oh, yeah?

299
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,714
Good to see you, darling.

300
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:15,650
-Come on. We'll get you in.
-This place is just so...

301
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:18,185
Oh, wow. Oh, sorry, shoes.

302
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,287
Oh, no, you can leave them on.
Don't worry.

303
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,189
-Sorry for the mess.
-Oh, no.

304
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,158
-Shall we put your bag
in your room? -Yeah.

305
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:26,493
-Wow.
-You like it?

306
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:28,262
Wow, this place.

307
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,997
Innit? Let me get you a drink.

308
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,599
Ooh.

309
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:33,701
-Very steep.
-Here we go.

310
00:15:33,735 --> 00:15:36,970
Wow.

311
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:38,172
Cozy.

312
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,206
<i>Cider.</i>

313
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,709
From our very own farm apples.

314
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:43,944
-No.
-Yeah.

315
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:50,184
That's the good stuff, right?

316
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:52,052
Strong.

317
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,621
Just you wait till
you try our calvados.

318
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:56,323
It's 150 proof.

319
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,059
Ant?

320
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,094
It's Agnes.

321
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,032
Oh. Say hi to Ant, sweetie.

322
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,201
Hi, Ant.

323
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,303
Oh, he's just a little shy.

324
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,371
Look, Agnes,
we made you a little bed.

325
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,340
Do you like it?

326
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:14,776
Yes.

327
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:16,310
It's great.

328
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,212
Ant, it's time for dinner.

329
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,447
-Come down when you're ready.
-Yeah.

330
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,387
Oh, and we got you this.

331
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,356
Oh, a candle.
You shouldn't have.

332
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:30,558
This is, uh, Feu de Bois.

333
00:16:30,592 --> 00:16:32,493
It's the scent
of a log fireplace.

334
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:34,762
That's good. We can stick it
next to the log fireplace.

335
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,432
And for the football fan.
Hut, hut!

336
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,334
Ah, Ben, Ben,
you shouldn't have, man.

337
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:41,703
-That's really-- Ant.
-Ah, please.

338
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:44,238
Ant, what do we say?

339
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,774
That's my boy. Hut!
I'm coming for you, boy.

340
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:49,109
I'm trying to get him to play
more contact sports, you know?

341
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:52,112
-It's good...
-It's good...

342
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,448
-It's good for them, you know?
They need that outlet. -Yeah.

343
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,183
God, I used to love
a tear-up, man.

344
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,652
What about you?
Do you play ball?

345
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:59,687
-Yeah, I mean, a little.
-Oh, yeah? Hut.

346
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:01,321
Wh-Whoa, whoa.

347
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,190
My reactions ain't
what they used to be either.

348
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:06,226
All right.
<i>Rosse Arance di Sicilia.</i>

349
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,562
It's Italian blood oranges.

350
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:10,163
-But look at the color in the...
-Mm-hmm. -Ooh.

351
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,231
Wow.

352
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:14,167
You are VIP guests.

353
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,770
When Paddy heard
you were coming,

354
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:17,805
he butchered Libby,
our prize goose,

355
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,373
and has been hanging her
in the outhouse.

356
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:22,075
She was some bird,
Libby. Regal girl.

357
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,277
Real queen of the farmyard,
you know?

358
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,646
I mean, what was she like?

359
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:26,280
-She had personality.
-She had personality.

360
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,483
Ta-da!

361
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:31,318
Libby à l'orange.

362
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,522
All right.
The old man's carving forks.

363
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:37,357
Sous chef, if you please.

364
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:40,460
-Just to...
-Raised with love.

365
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:41,596
Free-range.

366
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:43,531
Our wheat,

367
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:46,133
our grass, our orchards.

368
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:51,539
And now, Louise, my love.

369
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:54,207
Our gift to you.

370
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,810
Oh, God, that is so...

371
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,311
It-It's just a tiny morsel.

372
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:58,746
Um, I'll try it.

373
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,748
Well, we thought, for the lady.

374
00:18:00,782 --> 00:18:02,517
It's the best part of the roast.

375
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,185
Really crispy and yet
somehow manages to be soft

376
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,688
-all at the same time.
-Mm.

377
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:14,596
Mmm. Mmm.

378
00:18:14,629 --> 00:18:16,229
-It's good, right?
-Mm-hmm.

379
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,398
-It's okay?
-Mmm. Very good.

380
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,836
Can I, uh, can I help out
with anything?

381
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,471
Oh, what a gent.
Uh, yeah, that would be great.

382
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:27,240
Uh, serving platters,
second shelf.

383
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:31,879
Oh, they're just round there.

384
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:33,648
-Ah.
-Thank you.

385
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,167
Ant, come on, mate.

386
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:56,303
Bedtime. Chop-chop.

387
00:18:57,404 --> 00:19:00,273
That's my boy.

388
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,376
-Kids, right?
-Yeah.

389
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:09,316
Geez.

390
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,685
Are those original to the house?

391
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:13,955
Yeah. Keeps the heat in,
keeps the highwaymen out.

392
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:16,356
Geez, it's so quiet around here.

393
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,291
I mean, do you guys
even have any neighbors?

394
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,527
Yeah, all the way
across the valley,

395
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,562
but, you know,
we look after each other.

396
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:23,330
Ours are across the hall,

397
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,733
and I don't think
we've ever spoken.

398
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:27,401
Louise, you have a bad neck?

399
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:30,437
No, uh, it's just something
that flares up sometimes.

400
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,873
Medicinal? It's homegrown.

401
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:33,407
No, thank you. I took a pill.

402
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,577
Oh, modern medicine.

403
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:38,513
It is amazing.

404
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:40,748
But too often
we treat the symptom.

405
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:42,282
We don't treat the cause.

406
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:46,754
You know, technology's
advanced incredibly,

407
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:48,422
but emotionally speaking,

408
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:50,257
we're all still just...

409
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,793
cave dwellers.

410
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:57,364
It's all this perfect life,
Instagram, Facebook bullshit.

411
00:19:57,397 --> 00:20:00,835
Everybody talking
but nobody being honest.

412
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,336
It's left us--

413
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,507
I don't know--
impatient and stressy.

414
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,710
The Internet's been down
a half a day,

415
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:10,678
and I've nearly
bloody killed him, so...

416
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:13,548
I love it out here.

417
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:15,683
It's like a digital detox.

418
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:17,652
You know, get away from London
for a while.

419
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:19,020
Yeah.

420
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:20,454
Is he, is he all right?

421
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,289
Oh, no, no, he's fine.

422
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:23,925
-Yeah.
-Um, he'll crash in a minute.

423
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:24,992
He does this sometimes.

424
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:26,326
It's just part of his condition.

425
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,862
He's not in pain?

426
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:28,996
-No. -Uh, no.
-Okay.

427
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,733
No, no, no. No pain.

428
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:33,568
-You know, I'm gonna just check
on Agnes. -Yeah. Yeah.

429
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:35,503
Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

430
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:42,977
He's conked.

431
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,444
Wow.

432
00:20:56,524 --> 00:20:57,692
<i>You should've</i>
<i>said something to him.</i>

433
00:20:57,725 --> 00:21:00,360
They killed Libby,
the golden goose.

434
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:01,729
I was trying to make an effort.

435
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:03,531
I know. I know.

436
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,332
Oh.

437
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:06,768
-Ew.
-What?

438
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:08,435
Ben.

439
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:11,404
Do you think
these have been washed?

440
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,040
Oh, I think
we should say something.

441
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:16,309
No, honey, that is an old stain.

442
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:17,979
Look, we're in the country,
all right?

443
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:19,914
Our normal isn't their normal.

444
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:23,584
They're just a bit more--
I don't know-- unvarnished.

445
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:25,920
You don't think
it's weird for a doctor

446
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,688
to live in a house like this?

447
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:30,057
Look, this isn't America,
all right?

448
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:31,926
He does nonprofit work.

449
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,928
And they probably choose
to spend their money

450
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,930
on less material things,
you know?

451
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,799
Like vacation.

452
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:39,534
Mm-mm.

453
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,836
Do you have any idea what
the inside of Downton Abbey

454
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:43,938
actually looks like?

455
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,807
It's a shithole.

456
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,510
Hey.

457
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:51,813
Thank you for making the effort.

458
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,849
You're welcome.

459
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,084
Hello? Oh.

460
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:58,519
Hi, baby.

461
00:21:58,553 --> 00:21:59,954
I can't fall back asleep.

462
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,689
-Oh, honey. That's all right.
-That's okay. Come on.

463
00:22:01,722 --> 00:22:03,423
Let me get your breathing app
going for you.

464
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:06,027
No, no, no, I have it here.
Come on. Come in bed, baby.

465
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,862
Come on, come with Mom.

466
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:16,904
-Can we
keep the light on? -No.

467
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:18,072
No, honey.

468
00:22:18,105 --> 00:22:20,041
Here we go.

469
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:21,776
Okay.

470
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:25,746
We just need to calm down.

471
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,848
Settle in.

472
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:30,651

I'm glad you didn't.

495

An American

00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:40,621
Oh, well,
I saw my share growing up.

497
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:45,660
If unchecked, foxes, they kill
all the ground-nesting birds.

498
00:23:45,693 --> 00:23:47,895
Predator control is essential
to a balanced ecosystem.

499
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:50,064
-Balanced ecosystem.
-It is. -Mm.

500
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:53,067
Yes, I'm sure
a factory-made firearm is

501
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,970
nature's way of keeping that
delicate balance.

502
00:23:56,003 --> 00:23:57,104
Mm.

503
00:23:57,138 --> 00:24:00,007
-Mom?
-Ah. Excuse me.

504
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:05,746
Look at this.

505
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:08,883
You... Ant?

506
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,518
Do you think
you could move, honey,

507
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:12,720
so that Agnes can have a swing?

508
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:15,589
Uh, oh, hello.

509
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:17,758
Um, do you mind asking Ant
if he'll move?

510
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:19,860
-Just so that-- Agnes wants
to have a go. -Come on, pal.

511
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:21,595
Just for a second.

512
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:24,464
-Give you a piggyback, yeah?
-Come on.

513
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:27,101
Go on.

514
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,003
I'd have felt the back
of my dad's hand by now.

515
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:31,872
Paddy, Paddy. I-It's okay.
You don't, you don't have to.

516
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:34,175
It's all right, it's all right.
You want to, don't you, mate?

517
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,744
Go on. Give Agnes a push.

518
00:24:36,777 --> 00:24:38,478
Good boy.

519
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:44,251
Oh, come on,
that is not a push.

520
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:46,954
There. That's my boy.

521
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:52,126
-You flaring up?
-Yeah, it's just a...

522
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,628
-May I?
-Oh.

523
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:56,797
Go on, loosen your knees.

524
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:00,868
Oh, wow.

525
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:02,737
Yeah.

526
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:05,039
Your levator scapulae
is like a rope.

527
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:09,877
Can we just...

528
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:12,646
Yeah.

529
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:17,618
I know what you need.

530
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:19,053
Cold water therapy.

531
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:23,057
Clinically proven to reduce
inflammation and? Anyone?

532
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,158
Boost the immune system.

533
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,626
-Oh.
-Yeah.

534
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:27,061
W-Well, we didn't bring
our swimsuits.

535
00:25:27,094 --> 00:25:28,996
Oh, that's all right.
You can keep you knickers on.

536
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,664
Oh, what happened?

537
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:32,266
Oh, um...

538
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:34,969
Oh, uh, it got a little bit out
of hand last night.

539
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:37,705
I fell off
a ladder, picking apples.

540
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:39,707
Come on, you lot.

541
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,242
Get your kit off.

542
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:44,612
I promise we'll whack up the
heating in the car afterwards

543
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:47,815
and we will be warm again
in no time.

544
00:25:50,284 --> 00:25:53,020
You shouldn't be shy, Louise.
Got a great body.

545
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:54,188
Oh, thank you.

546
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:56,190
Yeah.

547
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:58,726
Right. Make sure when
you jump out, clear the rocks.

548
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,861
All right. Ant, Agnes,
jump with the dads, yeah?

549
00:26:00,895 --> 00:26:02,329
-Ready? In three, two...
-Oh, hold on.

550
00:26:02,363 --> 00:26:05,666
-One-one second. Sorry, sorry.
-Uh, uh...

551
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:07,201
-Is it safe? Is it deep enough?
-Uh, yeah.

552
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,136
I've done it hundreds of times,
since I was her age.

553
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,838
Yeah, just mind
you clear the rocks.

554
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:13,974
All right,
in three, two, one, go!

555
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,382
Oh! Whoo!

556
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:22,850
Go on, boy!

557
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:24,819
-Paddy, can he swim?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

558
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:26,687
Same way I learned:
sink or swim.

559
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,956
He'll be fine. Go on, Ant.

560
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:30,925
Oh, my God,
can Ant... can Ant swim?

561
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:33,027
Oh, don't worry.
Paddy's got him.

562
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,727
Shall we?

563
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:36,363
Oh, um... uh, y-you go ahead.

564
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:38,332
Okay.

565
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:44,839
-Come on, Louise!
-Go, Louise!

566
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:46,207
Come on!

567
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,975
-Come on, jump, jump, jump!
-Come on, jump!

568
00:26:48,008 --> 00:26:52,012
Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

569
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:53,380
Jump! Jump! Jump!

570
00:26:57,318 --> 00:26:59,920
-Oh, God.
-Geez!

571
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:02,089
That's a fucking fire hazard.

572
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:07,862
Look, Louise,
do you want to take a nap?

573
00:27:07,895 --> 00:27:10,998
Yeah, in their dirty bed?

574
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:13,934
Okay, let's everybody just...

575
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:16,737
I'm sorry.

576
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,273
I am trying.
I really, really am.

577
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:21,175
I just...

578
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:23,777
I don't find them
that pleasant to be around.

579
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:25,279
Okay.

580
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:29,850
Maybe we could use my neck
as an excuse.

581
00:27:29,884 --> 00:27:31,819
To leave?

582
00:27:31,852 --> 00:27:33,387
-Hey.
-Hi.

583
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,421
Am I interrupting?

584
00:27:34,455 --> 00:27:36,390
N-No.

585
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:39,693
Well, Paddy and I would like to
invite you for dinner tonight.

586
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:41,695
-Ooh.
-Yeah, there's this guy Mike.

587
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:43,030
He's a bit of a local legend.

588
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:44,798
I mean, rumor is he's a poacher,

589
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:46,300
but he's an amazing cook.

590
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,003
And, um, he has
this little place by the sea.

591
00:27:49,036 --> 00:27:51,338
Private room,
like a chef's table type thing.

592
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:52,439
-Oh, wow.
-Mmm.

593
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:53,874
Yeah, and it's super authentic,

594
00:27:53,908 --> 00:27:56,310
everything fresh, local.

595
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:58,846
-Um... great.
-Great.

596
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:00,881
We-We'd love to.
-Great.

597
00:28:04,952 --> 00:28:07,955
She seems really unpleasant.

598
00:28:09,757 --> 00:28:11,091
Okay, I was j--

599
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:17,097
Hey, let's...
let's try and reboot.

600
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:19,066
All right?
Remember what Nadine said?

601
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:22,770
Let's not make the perfect
the enemy of the good.

602
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:29,076
Oh, I hope
they have French fries.

603
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:30,811
Well, I'm sure
they will have chips,

604
00:28:30,844 --> 00:28:32,246
because that's
what they're called here.

605
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:35,082
Oh, wow!

606
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:37,084
You look like a million bucks.

607
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:38,819
Thank you. You look lovely.

608
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:40,454
You know what they say, man.

609
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:42,489
Happy wife, happy life.

610
00:28:42,524 --> 00:28:44,758
We don't actually shop
that often.

611
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:46,126
I mean, our philosophy...

612
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,262
Spend wisely
on the things that last.

613
00:28:48,295 --> 00:28:51,832
Yeah, that last, like, uh,
a watch or a ring or a memory.

614
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:53,234
Like Italy.

615
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:55,436
Yeah, and everything's
so disposable now,

616
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:56,837
so "fast fashion."

617
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,205
Isn't Ant coming?

618
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:02,276
Hey, Muhj! There he is.

619
00:29:03,077 --> 00:29:05,112
So, Muhjid doesn't speak
the best English,

620
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:07,047
-but he's a great babysitter.
-Hello.

621
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:08,916
You're-- Oh.

622
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:10,384
Oh, the-- are the kids
not coming with us?

623
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:11,986
Oh, no,
tonight's without the kids.

624
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:13,254
Didn't I tell you that?

625
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:15,557
Muhj had to flee
the war in Syria.

626
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,458
His hometown, Homs,
just obliterated.

627
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:18,459
Oh.

628
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:19,960
God, I'm so sorry.

629
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:21,395
Oh, thank you, sir.

630
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:23,330
Poor bugger, he's stuck
in the asylum system.

631
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:25,032
Can't officially work.

632
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:27,268
Don't worry.
He's thoroughly trustworthy.

633
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:29,103
-Back home, he was a teacher.
-Oh.

634
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:30,371
He's great with kids.

635
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:31,972
The whole neighborhood
feels the same.

636
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:33,274
And not just 'cause he's cheap.

637
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:35,142
Yeah, and the best part is

638
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:37,011
if there's any monkey business,
we'll get him deported.

639
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:40,381
-Brother, have a great night.
-Come.

640
00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:43,917
Come with me.
Let me show you. Come.

641
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:48,055
So do you think
we should leave her with him?

642
00:29:48,088 --> 00:29:51,358
We've had nannies before,
and he was a teacher.

643
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:53,193
Come on, Louise.
Let's go have a good time.

644
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,496
-Okay. Bye, baby.
-Hey, guys! Coming?

645
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:58,332
Come. Come, come.

-Are we almost there?
-Very soon.

651

<i>Wow. Wow, this place.</i>

652
00:30:30,464 --> 00:30:32,199
Oh, my God.

653
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:34,536
Yep, America's that way.
Dinner's that way.

654
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:38,640
The good news is,
we're the only diners tonight.

655
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:40,307
Oh, it's so cute.

656
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:43,511
Yep.
Not gonna find this on Yelp.

657
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:47,214
Mike goes out at night on
his own, sources all the food.

658
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:49,483
Incredible chef. He's...

659
00:30:49,517 --> 00:30:50,951
You should taste his game pie.

660
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:52,086
It's like...

661
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,354
Amazing.

662
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:56,123
Um, but just to remember,
I'm a vegetarian.

663
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:58,225
-Wait, yesterday.
-I know.

664
00:30:58,258 --> 00:31:00,160
I'm...
I should have said something.

665
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:01,462
I just-- I--

666
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:03,197
You guys had gone
to so much trouble...

667
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,532
-Oh, it's...
-Oh, mate, mate.

668
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:06,200
I feel like such an idiot.
I'm so sorry.

669
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:07,535
It was okay. Uh...

670
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:09,103
-Yeah, it was okay.
-Okay?

671
00:31:09,136 --> 00:31:10,371
Really, don't worry about it.

672
00:31:10,404 --> 00:31:12,206
Great. But you do still
eat fish, yeah?

673
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:15,577
-Yes. -Great. But--
Fish is not a meat?

674
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,144
Of course.

675
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:19,947
But, you know, it's better
for the environment.

676
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,115
Yeah, but the way
that industrial fishing

677
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:22,517
treats the oceans.

678
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,386
That is why I fundraise
for sustainable fishing

679
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:27,354
and for ecolabeling
on packaging...

680
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:29,591
That kind of pescatarianism
is a privilege.

681
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:33,026
Absolutely, but that's
not a reason not to do it.

682
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,395
What if you can't afford
line-caught?

683
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:35,697
Well, surely
you're not advocating

684
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,998
we all eat factory meat.

685
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:40,434
Rather than, you know, Libby.

686
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:45,939
It's... complicated.

687
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:47,941
Can we agree?

688
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:51,145
It is. It's complicated.
It is really complicated.

689
00:31:51,178 --> 00:31:52,946
And complicated is good.

690
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,182
Too many people these days
are afraid of honest debate.

691
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:57,117
Aren't they?
We're all too fucking polite.

692
00:31:57,151 --> 00:31:59,987
-Hey. Look at this sucker.
-There you go, eh? -Whoa.

693
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,188
Now, we trust that this is

694
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:02,690
sustainably sourced seafood,
Mike.

695
00:32:02,724 --> 00:32:04,425
Yeah, well, it's, uh,
it's done with Devon butter,

696
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:07,194
uh, wild samphire,
forest-foraged mushrooms,

697
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:09,263
cooked in, uh,
sustainable Devon cream, eh?

698
00:32:09,296 --> 00:32:10,998
-Fantastic.
-Yeah.

699
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:12,534
Uh, not the poisonous ones,
right? We can trust you, Mike?

700
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:14,168
Oh, well, that would be
telling, wouldn't it?

701
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:18,305
Right. Pot time.

702
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:24,746
...24, 25...

703
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:29,149
...26...

704
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:30,250
Under the bed.

705
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:34,488
...27, 28...

706
00:32:36,323 --> 00:32:38,358
-...29...
-Whoa.

707
00:32:38,392 --> 00:32:41,361
-That's a lot of watches.
-...30.

708
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:47,067
Ready or not, here I come.

709
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,136
I don't understand.

710
00:32:52,707 --> 00:32:54,174
Hello.

711
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:05,185
Where are you, little creatures?

712
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:18,633
<i>You know,</i>
<i>they say, you either become</i>

713
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:21,301
-like your parents or you go
the opposite way, right? -Mm.

714
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:23,136
I never met mine.

715
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,405
Hey, that's their loss, baby.

716
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:27,609
Their loss.

717
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:31,546
Mine were, if you'll excuse
the French, a couple of cunts.

718
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:34,816
So, you went
the other way or...?

719
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,190
"They fuck you up,
your mum and dad.

720
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:47,529
"They may not mean to,
but they do.

721
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:51,465
"They fill you
with the faults they had

722
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:54,234
"Then add some extra
just for you.

723
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:57,839
"But they were fucked up
in their turn

724
00:33:57,872 --> 00:34:01,576
"By fools
in old-style hats and coats,

725
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:04,344
"That half the time
were soppy-stern

726
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:07,281
"And half
at one another's throats.

727
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:12,085
"Man hands on misery to man.

728
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,089
"It deepens like
a coastal shelf.

729
00:34:17,124 --> 00:34:20,828
"Get out as early as you can,

730
00:34:20,862 --> 00:34:23,731
And don't have
any kids yourself."

731
00:34:24,732 --> 00:34:26,701
Hey.

732
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:28,435
Baby.

733
00:34:30,738 --> 00:34:33,140
She fucking...

734
00:34:34,274 --> 00:34:36,410
She rescued me, this one.

735
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:39,581
Saved me from the pit.

736
00:34:39,614 --> 00:34:41,381
Straightened me out.

737
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:43,150
And it's been what now?

738
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:44,451
17 years.

739
00:34:44,484 --> 00:34:46,854
-17 years.
-Wow.

740
00:34:46,888 --> 00:34:48,221
You get less for murder.

741
00:34:50,658 --> 00:34:54,361
And, you know, we still...
you know, every day.

742
00:34:54,394 --> 00:34:56,330
Every day? Oh, my God.

743
00:34:56,363 --> 00:34:59,366
Fuck. Ben's lucky
if he gets it once a month.

744
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:00,635
-What?
-Oh.

745
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:03,437
Well, you've got to work
at it.

746
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,672
I know.

747
00:35:04,706 --> 00:35:07,274
I mean, sometimes we role-play.

748
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:08,810
--Yeah.
-No.

749
00:35:08,843 --> 00:35:10,878
-Seriously.
-Yeah.

750
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:13,213
Teacher and student.

751
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:14,314
Mm.

752
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:15,750
Rock star and fan.

753
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:17,885
Strangers at a bar.

754
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:20,788
Horny waitress and hot customer.

755
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:22,557
Oh, my God.

756
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,925
-Sir?
-Mm-hmm?

757
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,459
How was your food?

758
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:27,562
It was tasty,
but I do like more spice.

759
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:28,863
-Do you?
-Yeah.

760
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,598
Stop it.

761
00:35:30,632 --> 00:35:33,601
Well, maybe for dessert, we can
go for something off menu.

762
00:35:33,635 --> 00:35:35,503
Yes, please.

763
00:35:35,536 --> 00:35:36,470
Oh, no.

764
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:38,506
Oh, sir, I think
you've dropped your napkin.

765
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:41,241
-I did. Fuck.
-I'll just slip under the table

766
00:35:41,274 --> 00:35:43,310
and sort that out for you.

767
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:51,552
Okay.

768
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:14,742
We were not really.

769
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:18,546
Oh, I love this woman.

770
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,313
Love her.

771
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:23,551
What is the biggest
sexual organ in the body?

772
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:25,586
Mm?

773
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,254
The brain.

774
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:29,557
What we can imagine is
infinitely more sexy

775
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,291
-than what we can do.
-Mm-hmm.

776
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:33,293
Just-just keeps it fresh.

777
00:36:33,326 --> 00:36:36,898
Which is why we both like
to dine out sometimes.

778
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:40,233
Yeah. Yeah.

779
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:42,737
Yeah.

780
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,871
Oh.

781
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:45,940
We think it's healthy. Mm.

782
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:50,410
--Mm. Okay.

783
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:54,314
Oh, my God. I love this tune.

784
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:55,983
Mike, bang it up, will you?

785
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:57,919
My dear?

786
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:08,029
So, she was how old
when they met?

787
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:10,598
Louise, don't go there.

788
00:37:10,631 --> 00:37:14,702
♪ Mississippi in the middle
of a dry spell... ♪

789
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,405
-That is punchy.
-Um, Paddy...

790
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:20,041
-Worth every penny, Mike.
-Paddy. We'll pitch in.

791
00:37:20,074 --> 00:37:22,777
Oh, that's very kind of you,
man. We'll get the car, okay?

792
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:26,647
Thank you, kind sir.

793
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:41,796
Ant, what are you doing?

794
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:58,079
God. Ant, what did you do?

795
00:37:58,112 --> 00:37:59,547
How did you get those?

796
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:11,324
Oh, she's an angel.

797
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:47,628
New book?

798
00:38:47,662 --> 00:38:50,865
Yeah. Um, Paddy recommended it.

799
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:54,969
Wow, you guys should
go off together.

800
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,436
What?

801
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:58,739
Or I could just switch rooms
if you like.

802
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:01,374
Louise, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

803
00:39:01,408 --> 00:39:03,578
-What?
-Why would you say that

804
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:05,146
after everything
that we've been through?

805
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:06,614
Hey, I was joking.

806
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:08,381
Yeah, no, but you do it
all the time.

807
00:39:08,415 --> 00:39:09,884
You know, b-belittling me.

808
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:11,886
I mean, saying that
I'm lucky to get laid?

809
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:13,120
Ben, that was a joke.

810
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:14,989
Yeah, but it's not
fucking funny.

811
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:17,424
Not when you're sexting a dad
at your daughter's school

812
00:39:17,457 --> 00:39:18,893
-like a fucking teenager.
-Okay. Okay. Ben.

813
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:21,095
-Ben, please.
-Well, think about it.

814
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:23,130
-How does that make me feel
when you say that? -I know.

815
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:26,834
I know, and I have said that
I am sorry a thousand times.

816
00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:29,003
But I-I don't know
what to do anymore.

817
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:30,738
I mean, it's been six months.

818
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:32,874
-We've been over this with
Nadine a thousand times. -Yeah.

819
00:39:32,907 --> 00:39:34,141
Yeah, that it's my fault.

820
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:35,610
-No, no, no, no.
-And Aggie...

821
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:36,978
I take responsibility
for my actions.

822
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:40,081
-But you... you are so angry.
-Yes!

823
00:39:40,114 --> 00:39:43,150
For seeing another man's dick
on my wife's phone?

824
00:39:43,184 --> 00:39:45,019
Please. Listen.

825
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:46,554
I am not excusing that,

826
00:39:46,587 --> 00:39:48,990
but you were angry
long before that, okay?

827
00:39:49,023 --> 00:39:51,592
You are so bitter at the world
for not giving you

828
00:39:51,626 --> 00:39:53,561
what you think you deserve
that-that you don't

829
00:39:53,594 --> 00:39:55,495
see all the things
in front of you.

830
00:39:55,529 --> 00:39:57,464
You can't turn this all on me.

831
00:39:57,497 --> 00:39:59,166
I moved to London for you.

832
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,768
I upended my life.

833
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:02,904
I lost my job. I lost my house.

834
00:40:02,937 --> 00:40:06,507
I lost everything
that makes me me, for you.

835
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,609
And when you lost your job,
I agreed to stay

836
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:10,477
and help you and support you

837
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:11,879
and keep your life
running smoothly

838
00:40:11,913 --> 00:40:14,582
so that you could have access
to all of Europe.

839
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:17,551
But where the fuck is
my access to my husband?

840
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:19,186
You know, I-I don't know
if you're with me

841
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,823
because you love me or because
you just can't stand to fail.

842
00:40:26,227 --> 00:40:27,728
Look.

843
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,831
Louise, I'm...

844
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:35,202
I do care.

845
00:40:35,236 --> 00:40:36,904
I'm...

846
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:39,807
I'm really trying.

847
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,015
Yes.

848
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:49,183
We both are.

849
00:40:53,054 --> 00:40:55,089
Let's...

850
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:57,892
please...

851
00:40:57,925 --> 00:40:59,860
be friends.

852
00:41:13,207 --> 00:41:15,009
Look, I'm sorry.

853
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:19,981
I'm sorry.

854
00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:24,712
Agnes, baby.

855
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:36,023
Ben.

856
00:42:36,991 --> 00:42:38,926
Ben.

857
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:40,194
What?

858
00:42:40,227 --> 00:42:42,630
-We're leaving.
-What?

859
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:19,867
Mom? Where's Hoppy?

860
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:24,238
Uh, I-I don't know.

861
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:26,107
Did you have him when we left?

862
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,975
I don't think so.

863
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,762
<i>Sweetie, he's not there.</i>

864
00:43:48,796 --> 00:43:50,030
<i>I want Hoppy.</i>

865
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:51,866
Agnes, you got to grow
out of this.

866
00:43:51,899 --> 00:43:53,400
You're almost 12 years old.

867
00:43:53,434 --> 00:43:56,003
Ben, it's not helpful. Please.

868
00:43:56,036 --> 00:43:59,273
Listen, when we get home, we'll
ask them to mail him, okay?

869
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:00,975
He'll get hurt like Ant.

870
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:03,043
Honey, Ant's not hurt.
He was born like that.

871
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:05,880
-We'll buy another Hoppy.
-No, I need my Hoppy!

872
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:07,882
Agnes, please calm down, okay?

873
00:44:07,915 --> 00:44:09,850
-They're gonna do that to Hoppy!
-Breathe. Agnes!

874
00:44:09,884 --> 00:44:11,352
Hey! Enough!

875
00:44:11,385 --> 00:44:13,287
Hey!

876
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,856
Oh, my God!

877
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:18,726
Oh, Jesus.

878
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:22,062
Oh. You okay? Are you okay?

879
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:27,401
We can't leave him there.
We can't leave him there.

880
00:44:27,434 --> 00:44:29,770
They're gonna do that to Hoppy.

881
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:31,906
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

882
00:45:07,474 --> 00:45:09,944
All right. I'll be right back.

883
00:45:09,977 --> 00:45:11,212
What if they're awake?

884
00:45:11,245 --> 00:45:14,982
Louise, just give me
two minutes, okay?

885
00:45:46,347 --> 00:45:48,048
Okay.

886
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:50,784
Be right back, okay? Okay?

887
00:46:16,343 --> 00:46:18,580
-No. No.
-Louise, um,

888
00:46:18,613 --> 00:46:20,114
j-just go back to the car.

889
00:46:20,147 --> 00:46:21,583
I'll be there in two minutes.

890
00:46:21,616 --> 00:46:23,984
Look, like I said, we didn't
want to, like, wake you...

891
00:46:24,018 --> 00:46:25,286
-What?
-What's going on?

892
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:27,421
Uh, we've got
a bit of a situation.

893
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:29,890
Someone was leaving
without saying goodbye.

894
00:46:29,923 --> 00:46:34,128
No, look, I was just saying to
Paddy we had such a good time.

895
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:36,897
Well, then I've got to ask
again, wait, why did you leave?

896
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,199
Be honest.

897
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:41,435
Look, look,
some-some things happened

898
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:44,471
that made us feel like it was
best that we head back home.

899
00:46:44,506 --> 00:46:47,441
What things?
Uh, I think we deserve to know.

900
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:48,876
Mm-hmm.

901
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:53,047
A-Agnes doesn't like
sleeping on the floor,

902
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,349
and so she-she comes
into the room at night

903
00:46:55,382 --> 00:46:57,384
and the-the bed's
really small, so we...

904
00:46:57,418 --> 00:47:00,321
-I'm sorry that our house
isn't huge... -No, it's not...

905
00:47:00,354 --> 00:47:02,056
...and that
Agnes doesn't feel comfortable

906
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:03,457
-in Ant's room, but...
-No!

907
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,559
She was in your bed.

908
00:47:04,592 --> 00:47:06,060
-What?
-Yeah.

909
00:47:06,093 --> 00:47:07,227
-Who? What?
-Our daughter was in your bed.

910
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:08,630
-Yes, I'm sorry. Okay?
-Ciara?

911
00:47:08,663 --> 00:47:10,331
Paddy was asleep
for the whole thing.

912
00:47:10,364 --> 00:47:11,432
That's my fault, okay?

913
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:14,468
Well, I'm-I'm sorry,
but-but that is crossing a line.

914
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:16,470
-I mean, th-that is not okay.
-Uh, it's my fault. I'm sorry.

915
00:47:16,504 --> 00:47:18,172
I'm-I'm sorry.

916
00:47:18,205 --> 00:47:20,608
I... Look, I know I can be
overprotective as a mother.

917
00:47:20,642 --> 00:47:23,177
Wh-What does that
have to do with it?

918
00:47:24,078 --> 00:47:26,581
We had a baby daughter.

919
00:47:26,614 --> 00:47:28,949
Uh, no.

920
00:47:28,982 --> 00:47:31,051
Mary.

921
00:47:31,085 --> 00:47:36,990
And, um, she died
at 12 weeks of a cot death.

922
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:39,493
We would've been
the perfect family.

923
00:47:40,461 --> 00:47:43,397
So hearing Agnes crying,
it just...

924
00:47:44,431 --> 00:47:47,034
Um, so, she was just--
she-she was--

925
00:47:47,067 --> 00:47:49,370
She kept calling for you,
and-and you didn't come,

926
00:47:49,403 --> 00:47:52,106
and she was beside herself,
scratching herself and...

927
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:54,208
Well, and you weren't
there, so...

928
00:47:54,241 --> 00:47:56,276
Look, you-you know how hard
it is trying to decide

929
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,412
when to intervene
and when to give them space,

930
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:01,048
and I'm... I'm so sorry
if I got it wrong.

931
00:48:01,081 --> 00:48:03,283
I'm so sorry.

932
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:05,219
-Ciara. I didn't know.
-Like, we are...

933
00:48:05,252 --> 00:48:07,921
Mom! Ant found him!

934
00:48:07,955 --> 00:48:09,591
-Oh, good.
-Oh.

935
00:48:09,624 --> 00:48:11,191
Good boy. Good boy.

936
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,697
-What's he saying?
-I think he's trying to say

937
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,998
he's sad
you're leaving because...

938
00:48:18,031 --> 00:48:19,933
'cause he wanted to show you
the chickens.

939
00:48:21,669 --> 00:48:23,404
-Can we?
-Uh...

940
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:26,240
Hey, you remember that time,
the first time you came to stay

941
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:28,008
and you tried to leave 'cause
you flipped out in the night

942
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:29,943
and you didn't say goodbye?

943
00:48:29,977 --> 00:48:32,179
Eh?

944
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,253
They look sweet together,
don't they?

945
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:44,024
We wanted another.

946
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:47,494
But...

947
00:48:47,529 --> 00:48:50,330
after two miscarriages...

948
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:55,436
Life can be
so fucking unfair. Sorry.

949
00:48:59,072 --> 00:49:01,442
I don't understand.

950
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:03,578
Ant, I can't read it.

951
00:49:11,218 --> 00:49:14,188
-How are your eggs
coming along? -Good.

952
00:49:15,355 --> 00:49:17,324
Let's see.

953
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,995
Oh, these are great.

954
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:23,464
I think, Agnes,

955
00:49:23,497 --> 00:49:26,534
that yours is the best.

956
00:49:28,703 --> 00:49:30,538
Oh.

957
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:35,375
♪ Close your eyes ♪

958
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:39,313

00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:43,150

965
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:03,203
But it made no sense.

966
00:50:03,237 --> 00:50:05,439
It was gobbledygook.

967
00:50:05,472 --> 00:50:06,808
Can I see it?

968
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:09,009
He ate it.

969
00:50:11,378 --> 00:50:13,247
I think
he's going through a lot,

970
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,382
and we need to be kind.

971
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:17,384
-Okay? -No, something's
not right with him.

972
00:50:17,417 --> 00:50:18,753
Okay, Agnes,

973
00:50:18,786 --> 00:50:20,354
sometimes it's okay
to think things,

974
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:21,723
but you can't actually say them.

975
00:50:21,756 --> 00:50:23,257
Mom, it's not normal.

976
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,491
Agnes, love,

977
00:50:24,526 --> 00:50:27,160
do you want to
come help me peel these?

978
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,602
Some nice carrots, hmm?

979
00:50:49,817 --> 00:50:51,686
Sorry, man.

980
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:53,186
Oh.

981
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,822
No, here, give me that.

982
00:50:54,856 --> 00:50:57,592
Here we go.

983
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:03,130
It's not even about
the kill for me.

984
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:05,867
It's always been about the hunt.

985
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,602
You know?
Getting them in the crosshairs.

986
00:51:07,635 --> 00:51:11,238
Luring the fish onto the hook.
That's the game.

987
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:14,074
That's what I live for.

988
00:51:18,378 --> 00:51:21,448
Look, maybe this isn't my place,

989
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:25,152
but last night,
we heard you two shouting.

990
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:26,453
I'm sorry, man.

991
00:51:26,486 --> 00:51:29,256
You know, cheating is
really hard to get over.

992
00:51:31,926 --> 00:51:33,226
Louise didn't actually.

993
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,096
It was... it was just text.

994
00:51:37,765 --> 00:51:40,868
Mm. Whatever she did,
thoughtcrime or whatever,

995
00:51:40,902 --> 00:51:42,537
just-- who cares?

996
00:51:44,204 --> 00:51:45,840
All this...

997
00:51:45,873 --> 00:51:49,142
all this in here...

998
00:51:51,244 --> 00:51:53,380
That's gonna eat you alive.

999
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:57,384
You got to let it out.

1000
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:01,589
Will you let me
show you something?

1001
00:52:59,246 --> 00:53:00,915
I'm starving!

1002
00:53:00,948 --> 00:53:02,684
-And you do it four times.
-Could eat a horse!

1003
00:53:02,717 --> 00:53:03,951
And then-- Do you want me
to show you the first part?

1004
00:53:03,985 --> 00:53:05,586
Could eat a Ciara.

1005
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,487
So it's like that. One, two...

1006
00:53:07,522 --> 00:53:10,725
Oy, oy, come on.
Careful, kids. All right?

1007
00:53:10,758 --> 00:53:13,460
You knock over one of
your mother's sculptures

1008
00:53:13,493 --> 00:53:15,429
and there will be hell to pay.

1009
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:16,631
-Have you shown them these?
-No.

1010
00:53:16,664 --> 00:53:18,766
Guys, have you seen this?
This is Ciara's.

1011
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,601
One of many.

1012
00:53:20,635 --> 00:53:23,303
It's called <i>Mother's Love.</i>

1013
00:53:23,336 --> 00:53:24,471
-Wow.
-Oh.

1014
00:53:24,505 --> 00:53:25,740
-Yeah? Yeah, one of many.
-Oh, God.

1015
00:53:25,773 --> 00:53:28,308
-Ciara, those are stunning.
-Wow.

1016
00:53:28,341 --> 00:53:30,377
-I mean, it's just a hobby.
-Hey, don't put yourself down.

1017
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:31,846
That's my job.
Louise, thank you so much

1018
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:33,648
-for helping with the cooking.
-Yeah. Of course. -Paddy.

1019
00:53:33,681 --> 00:53:36,684
Mom. Mom. Can Ant and I
show you our dance?

1020
00:53:36,718 --> 00:53:38,485
-Ye-- -Oh.
Maybe after lunch, sweetie.

1021
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:40,922
Actually, Agnes, could you set
the table for me, please?

1022
00:53:40,955 --> 00:53:42,557
Oh, yeah. Go on, Agnes.

1023
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:45,325
Show Ciara how good you are
at setting the table.

1024
00:53:46,694 --> 00:53:48,462
-Ooh. -Oh, God.
-What happened?

1025
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:49,731
-Honey, honey, run it
under the tap. -Mm, mm, mm.

1026
00:53:49,764 --> 00:53:51,498
-You okay? -You all right?
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1027
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:53,601
Hey, um, uh, Paddy, can you
come take a look at this?

1028
00:53:53,634 --> 00:53:55,737
Uh, yeah, sure.

1029
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,805
Thank God there's a doctor
in the house.

1030
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,406
I'm not a doctor.

1031
00:53:59,439 --> 00:54:00,875
-What?
-Wait.

1032
00:54:00,908 --> 00:54:03,343
Well, didn't you say
you were a doctor?

1033
00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:05,580
Did I?

1034
00:54:05,613 --> 00:54:07,749
In-in Italy, you...

1035
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:10,785
Look.

1036
00:54:10,818 --> 00:54:13,955
Uh, sometimes
when I meet new people, I...

1037
00:54:13,988 --> 00:54:15,857
I'll get a little bit
self-conscious, you know?

1038
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:18,492
-He just wants to make
a good impression. -Yeah.

1039
00:54:18,526 --> 00:54:20,795
What do you,
what do you do, then?

1040
00:54:20,828 --> 00:54:22,630
Well, I don't do anything.

1041
00:54:22,663 --> 00:54:24,464
Like, anything?

1042
00:54:24,498 --> 00:54:27,367
No. Well, I don't work.
I don't believe in it.

1043
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,770
-Oh.
-Yeah, we get by, right?

1044
00:54:28,803 --> 00:54:30,671
-Mm. Mm. -Yeah, we sell
a bit of marijuana,

1045
00:54:30,705 --> 00:54:32,640
drop a bit of cider
to the locals.

1046
00:54:32,673 --> 00:54:34,407
Let's get that fixed.
Where's the plasters?

1047
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:35,408
Oh.

1048
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:44,886
Oh, my God.

1049
00:54:44,919 --> 00:54:46,687
Look at their faces.

1050
00:54:46,721 --> 00:54:48,689
You should have
taken a picture.

1051
00:54:48,723 --> 00:54:51,324
Of course I'm a bloody doctor.

1052
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:53,661
-Oh!
-We totally had them.

1053
00:54:53,694 --> 00:54:55,096
-We totally had them, right?
-Well, yeah, I mean...

1054
00:54:55,129 --> 00:54:56,898
You fucking asshole.

1055
00:54:56,931 --> 00:54:59,432
Come on. How else
could we afford all this?

1056
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:00,635
Come here.

1057
00:55:03,436 --> 00:55:04,772
-Here, try that.
-What is this?

1058
00:55:04,806 --> 00:55:06,908
They say it smells like
a rugby club locker room.

1059
00:55:06,941 --> 00:55:08,676
Mmm!

1060
00:55:08,709 --> 00:55:09,944
Yeah, right?

1061
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:11,779
Agnes, love, you have to eat
your vegetables.

1062
00:55:11,813 --> 00:55:13,413
...I'm increasingly finding

1063
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:14,916
the simple things in life
bring you joy.

1064
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:16,449
Eat your greens, sweetheart.

1065
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:19,620
And, Agnes, we don't chew
with our mouths open.

1066
00:55:19,654 --> 00:55:22,690
Gorgonzola,
Camembert, Emmental.

1067
00:55:22,723 --> 00:55:25,492
You can keep it.
Stinking Bishop is number one.

1068
00:55:25,526 --> 00:55:27,662
-Never had it.
-Get it. -Agnes?

1069
00:55:27,695 --> 00:55:30,097
Please, could you stop
telling my daughter what to do?

1070
00:55:30,131 --> 00:55:31,431
Mmm!

1071
00:55:31,464 --> 00:55:32,867
But she needs to be told, so...

1072
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,535
Yes, but you're not her mother.
I'm her mother.

1073
00:55:34,569 --> 00:55:35,903
Yeah. But you do agree, right?

1074
00:55:35,937 --> 00:55:37,839
That it's disgusting
eating with my mouth open.

1075
00:55:37,872 --> 00:55:38,940
Okay.

1076
00:55:38,973 --> 00:55:41,676
Yeah. But it's for
her parents to tell her.

1077
00:55:41,709 --> 00:55:43,611
-Is that the rule?
-Yeah.

1078
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:46,581
Mm. No, Ciara grew up
in the care system.

1079
00:55:46,614 --> 00:55:48,583
All the kids
parenting each other,

1080
00:55:48,616 --> 00:55:50,383
doing what they were told.

1081
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:53,020
I mean, she doesn't know
"the rules." Sorry.

1082
00:55:53,054 --> 00:55:54,922
I didn't mean anything
by it, Louise.

1083
00:55:54,956 --> 00:55:56,991
To be fair, though, you
did cross a line for Louise.

1084
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:58,626
You don't criticize
other people's children.

1085
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:00,127
You should say sorry.

1086
00:56:00,161 --> 00:56:01,128
It's okay.

1087
00:56:01,162 --> 00:56:02,495
I'm sorry, Louise.

1088
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,899
And to Agnes.

1089
00:56:04,932 --> 00:56:06,033
I'm sorry, Agnes.

1090
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:07,735
It's okay.

1091
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,638
Louise?

1092
00:56:12,773 --> 00:56:14,675
There anything
you'd like to say?

1093
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,016
I-I maybe...

1094
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:23,584
overreacted.

1095
00:56:23,618 --> 00:56:25,786
Off we go. It's all good.

1096
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,622
It's all good.
A healthy disagreement.

1097
00:56:27,655 --> 00:56:31,025
Teach our kids we can be honest
with each other.

1098
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:33,794
Right, top up.

1099
00:56:34,629 --> 00:56:37,598
Agnes, um, why don't
you and Ant show us your, um,

1100
00:56:37,632 --> 00:56:39,600

00:56:39,634 --> 00:56:41,903
-Yes.
-Sure.

This is about doing
what is right, okay?

1191
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,145
I mean, y-you should be
offering your son

1192

not shouting at him.

1195
00:59:43,084 --> 00:59:45,386

01:00:44,378 --> 01:00:46,280
<i>Please</i>
<i>don't leave before Paddy's up.</i>

1215
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:50,718
He'll be so angry, and it would
be better for me and for Ant.

1216
01:00:51,352 --> 01:00:52,753
Wait, is it that bad?

1217
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:54,321
If you could just
let him save face.

1218
01:00:54,355 --> 01:00:56,157
Like a reminder on your phone

1219
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:59,059
of an appointment
you can't miss.

1220
01:01:48,442 --> 01:01:51,111
God, he's rubbish, isn't he?

1221
01:02:10,197 --> 01:02:12,066
Ant, what is it?

1222
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:58,172
That's your...

1223
01:04:36,611 --> 01:04:38,011
Oh, my God.

1224
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,881
Oh, my God.

1225
01:04:57,164 --> 01:05:00,167
I need to get my parents alone.
They'll know what to do.

1226
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:18,952
Dad. Play catch?

1227
01:05:19,987 --> 01:05:21,455
When I finish my coffee.

1228
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:33,500
Oh, fuck.

1229
01:05:33,535 --> 01:05:35,436
All right, shithead.

1230
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:39,440
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

1231
01:05:43,711 --> 01:05:45,547
What the fuck?

1232
01:05:49,149 --> 01:05:51,385
Oh, coffee.

1233
01:05:51,418 --> 01:05:53,187
That's a good lad.

1234
01:06:00,027 --> 01:06:01,361
Show me.

1235
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,102
Show me love.

1236
01:06:26,721 --> 01:06:29,122
You're smelling stale, boy.

1237
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:35,496
Oh, fuck.

1238
01:06:39,132 --> 01:06:42,537
Oh, now you want a piggyback.

1239
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:44,471
You cheeky sod.

1240
01:06:45,573 --> 01:06:48,576
Actually, it'll show everyone
we're still friends. Come on.

1241
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:51,646
Come on. Hop on.

1242
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:53,380
Oh, fucking hell.

1243
01:06:53,413 --> 01:06:56,183
What have you been eating?

1244
01:06:56,216 --> 01:06:58,520
Come on.

1245
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:28,315
Hey.

1246
01:07:29,182 --> 01:07:31,519
I am so sorry.

1247
01:07:31,553 --> 01:07:32,820
I-I just...

1248
01:07:32,854 --> 01:07:38,325
I drank way too much,
and I was way out of line.

1249
01:07:41,328 --> 01:07:43,665
I think we all drank too much.

1250
01:07:45,633 --> 01:07:47,134
Where's Agnes?

1251
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:49,169
Here she is.

1252
01:07:49,202 --> 01:07:50,772
Hey, honey.

1253
01:07:50,805 --> 01:07:52,574
You okay?

1254
01:07:52,607 --> 01:07:54,642
Aggie, what's the matter?

1255
01:07:56,443 --> 01:07:58,178
-Did you cut yourself?
-Oh.

1256
01:07:58,211 --> 01:08:00,447
Oh. No.

1257
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,750
Uh, okay, that's fine. Come on.

1258
01:08:02,784 --> 01:08:04,451
-What's going on? -I'm gonna
take you to the bathroom.

1259
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:06,621
-She got her period.
-Oh.

1260
01:08:08,623 --> 01:08:11,224
--Oh. Oh,
this is all totally normal.

1261
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:13,393
Mom, no, it's not.

1262
01:08:15,663 --> 01:08:18,566
Ah! Listen, I need a beer.
Do you want one?

1263
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,400
No, I'm good.

1264
01:08:20,434 --> 01:08:22,570
Whoa! All right.

1265
01:08:22,604 --> 01:08:25,506
All right. Where's this
newfound enthusiasm come from?

1266
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:28,509
Five more minutes, all right?

1267
01:08:29,443 --> 01:08:32,245
Go on, Ben.
Put some heat in that arm.

1268
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:36,183
Whoop! Fuck. Wow.

1269
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,401
We're gonna leave, right?

1270
01:08:55,703 --> 01:08:57,939
Aggie, we're gonna leave.

1271
01:08:57,972 --> 01:09:00,875
We just need to stay calm.

1272
01:09:00,908 --> 01:09:02,476
-How can I stay calm?
-Okay.

1273
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:04,244
What about Ant?
We need to take Ant.

1274
01:09:04,277 --> 01:09:05,580
Aggie? Listen.

1275
01:09:05,613 --> 01:09:07,414
I need you to be brave, okay?
Can you be brave?

1276
01:09:07,447 --> 01:09:08,883
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1277
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:11,451
You're gonna stay here,
and you're gonna sit tight,

1278
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:13,420
and you're gonna lock the door.

1279
01:09:13,453 --> 01:09:14,488
Yeah?

1280
01:09:15,757 --> 01:09:17,190
-Mom...
-Aggie.

1281
01:09:17,224 --> 01:09:18,826
Lock the door.

1282
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,427
Okay?

1283
01:09:36,878 --> 01:09:38,513
Everything all right?

1284
01:09:38,546 --> 01:09:40,280
Yeah, it'll be fine.

1285
01:09:40,313 --> 01:09:42,884
She just, uh...

1286
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:45,720
got herself into
a bit of a state.

1287
01:09:45,753 --> 01:09:47,522
Ben, she asked for you.

1288
01:09:47,555 --> 01:09:49,957
He's always better with her
when she's like this.

1289
01:09:49,991 --> 01:09:51,526
Hmm.

1290
01:09:51,559 --> 01:09:53,695
-Sorry about this, guys.
-No, no, no, no.

1291
01:09:53,728 --> 01:09:54,762
No worries.

1292
01:09:54,796 --> 01:09:56,363
Hey.

1293
01:09:56,998 --> 01:09:58,800
Can we do anything?

1294
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:01,234
No. It'll be fine.

1295
01:10:01,268 --> 01:10:02,737
Don't worry.

1296
01:10:15,683 --> 01:10:17,552
Okay.

1297
01:10:17,585 --> 01:10:18,820
Okay.

1298
01:10:19,654 --> 01:10:21,923
Louise.
Louise, what are you doing?

1299
01:10:21,956 --> 01:10:23,390
Everything okay in there?

1300
01:10:23,423 --> 01:10:24,992
Yeah, we're all good.

1301
01:10:25,026 --> 01:10:26,594
Anything we can get you?

1302
01:10:26,627 --> 01:10:29,296
No, no, no.
We'll just be a minute.

1303
01:10:30,798 --> 01:10:32,900
We can't let on.

1304
01:10:32,934 --> 01:10:34,301
Yeah?

1305
01:10:34,334 --> 01:10:35,937
We can't look stressed
or scared.

1306
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:38,840
We just have to go out there
and be completely normal, okay?

1307
01:10:38,873 --> 01:10:41,341
We've been pretending
it's normal since we got here.

1308
01:10:41,374 --> 01:10:44,512
This is so not normal.

1309
01:10:44,545 --> 01:10:47,380
I can't do this.
I can't go out there.

1310
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:51,018
Okay. You're right.

1311
01:10:51,052 --> 01:10:52,720
You're right, baby.
It's not normal.

1312
01:10:52,754 --> 01:10:55,957
And you don't have to pretend
it's normal.

1313
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:58,492
I think that we tell them

1314
01:10:58,526 --> 01:11:00,995
that you had
your first period, yeah?

1315
01:11:01,028 --> 01:11:02,764
And-and-and that
you're super freaked out

1316
01:11:02,797 --> 01:11:04,932
and that even your daddy
couldn't calm you down,

1317
01:11:04,966 --> 01:11:06,667
so we just need to get you home.

1318
01:11:06,701 --> 01:11:08,468
Okay?

1319
01:11:08,502 --> 01:11:10,838
Oh, no, no, baby, baby.

1320
01:11:10,872 --> 01:11:12,405
All those tears are good.

1321
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:14,842
All those anxious thoughts,
you can show them.

1322
01:11:14,876 --> 01:11:16,343
-Okay?
-Okay.

1323
01:11:16,376 --> 01:11:17,344
Okay.

1324
01:11:20,815 --> 01:11:23,283
Okay.

1325
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:37,297
Yeah, all right. See you soon.

1326
01:11:39,534 --> 01:11:41,936
-Hey, how is she?
-Hi.

1327
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:45,338
Oh, she's, uh, well, she's
pretty freaked out.

1328
01:11:45,372 --> 01:11:46,507
Oh, bless her.

1329
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:48,375
-Yeah. -It's a big day.
-Yeah.

1330
01:11:48,408 --> 01:11:49,710
Yeah, yeah.

1331
01:11:49,744 --> 01:11:53,681
She's just totally overwhelmed
and-and, uh...

1332
01:11:53,714 --> 01:11:56,951
I think it might be best
if we got her home.

1333
01:11:56,984 --> 01:11:59,386
-Yeah.
-Oh. Okay.

1334
01:11:59,419 --> 01:12:01,956
Well, does she want
to lie down or...?

1335
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:03,825
No. I-I-I think she just,

1336
01:12:03,858 --> 01:12:06,060
she just wants her own bed,
right, sweetie?

1337
01:12:06,093 --> 01:12:07,662
Yeah, I mean, I-I--

1338
01:12:07,695 --> 01:12:09,130
She'll probably just sleep
in the car, to be honest.

1339
01:12:09,163 --> 01:12:10,698
Aw. It's okay, love.

1340
01:12:12,033 --> 01:12:13,466
-Oh.
-Oh.

1341
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,770
She's just feeling
a little self-conscious.

1342
01:12:15,803 --> 01:12:17,370
There's no need.

1343
01:12:17,404 --> 01:12:19,472
-Perfectly natural.
-Yeah.

1344
01:12:20,508 --> 01:12:22,944
Yeah, you're not a girl anymore.

1345
01:12:22,977 --> 01:12:24,477
You're a woman now.

1346
01:12:25,478 --> 01:12:28,716
Must have been
a bit of a shock for you.

1347
01:12:28,749 --> 01:12:30,751
Out there.

1348
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:35,156
-Would you like a drop
of brandy? -No.

1349
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:37,424
I think
we're gonna hit the road.

1350
01:12:38,059 --> 01:12:40,561
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

1351
01:12:40,595 --> 01:12:42,129
You know, we-we had
a really great time.

1352
01:12:42,163 --> 01:12:45,066
Well... well, I hope so.

1353
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:46,667
I know we can both be...

1354
01:12:46,701 --> 01:12:48,135
A bit much.

1355
01:12:48,169 --> 01:12:49,637
Oh, God. No, no. Really.

1356
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:51,172
-I mean, you-you guys
have been... -Aw.

1357
01:12:51,205 --> 01:12:53,841
Just a breath of fresh air.

1358
01:12:54,809 --> 01:12:58,946
Oh, well, that is
very sweet of you to say.

1359
01:13:11,726 --> 01:13:12,927
You're sure I can't quickly

1360
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,729
make you some sandwiches
for the journey?

1361
01:13:14,762 --> 01:13:16,463
Oh, that's so kind of you,

1362
01:13:16,496 --> 01:13:18,799
but we'll, uh,
we'll just stop on the way.

1363
01:13:22,837 --> 01:13:25,940
Oh, shit. The tire.

1364
01:13:25,973 --> 01:13:27,742
We'll just drive on it.

1365
01:13:27,775 --> 01:13:29,110
No, they're gonna see it.

1366
01:13:29,143 --> 01:13:30,511
We'll be gone.

1367
01:13:30,544 --> 01:13:32,880
But they have to open the gate.

1368
01:13:33,948 --> 01:13:38,119
All right, well, uh, again,
thanks so much.

1369
01:13:38,152 --> 01:13:39,520
-You're all set?
-Yep.

1370
01:13:39,553 --> 01:13:41,656
-Yeah. Great.
-Yeah.

1371
01:13:41,689 --> 01:13:43,456
Oh, you're kidding.

1372
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:45,092
Oh, no.

1373
01:13:45,126 --> 01:13:46,594
Ugh.

1374
01:13:46,627 --> 01:13:48,763
That is bad luck. Come see.

1375
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:54,467
Yeah. Yeah, you got a nail.

1376
01:13:54,501 --> 01:13:58,539
That is really, really bad luck.

1377
01:13:58,572 --> 01:14:02,176
Well, um, you have a phone?
I can call the AA.

1378
01:14:02,209 --> 01:14:04,612
Behave. You don't need the AA.

1379
01:14:04,645 --> 01:14:07,715
I can plug this in a jiffy.
Come on.

1380
01:14:08,549 --> 01:14:10,251
No, it's fine.

1381
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:11,886
W-We got an annual membership.

1382
01:14:11,919 --> 01:14:13,554
It's the least I could do, man.

1383
01:14:13,587 --> 01:14:15,222
Come on. Come give me a hand
with the kit.

1384
01:14:15,256 --> 01:14:16,624
Won't be a tick.

1385
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:27,735
Just around here.

1386
01:15:07,308 --> 01:15:09,076
Do me a favor.

1387
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:10,578
Grab that jack.

1388
01:15:28,763 --> 01:15:29,930
Right.

1389
01:15:31,665 --> 01:15:33,634
Well, why don't we call it, uh,

1390
01:15:33,667 --> 01:15:36,137
90 for labor, 70 for parts.

1391
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:37,171
Paddy.

1392
01:15:38,305 --> 01:15:39,673
All right, gang.

1393
01:15:39,707 --> 01:15:42,009
-Let's hit the road.
-Yeah.

1394
01:15:42,043 --> 01:15:45,780
Agnes, you, uh,
got everything you need?

1395
01:15:45,813 --> 01:15:47,715
Yep.

1396
01:15:47,748 --> 01:15:49,917
Yeah.

1397
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:52,086
You absolutely sure?

1398
01:15:52,119 --> 01:15:54,088
-Mom.
-Mm-hmm?

1399
01:15:57,691 --> 01:15:59,360
Um...

1400
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:00,761
Oh, no.

1401
01:16:00,795 --> 01:16:02,630
How the hell
did he get up there?

1402
01:16:02,663 --> 01:16:03,998
Ant, you do that?

1403
01:16:05,232 --> 01:16:06,867
I just want to be at home.

1404
01:16:06,901 --> 01:16:09,003
Well, you can't leave
without Hoppy, right, mate?

1405
01:16:10,204 --> 01:16:12,606
No, we can't.

1406
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,208
I was actually doing
the guttering

1407
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:15,776
just before you guys arrived.

1408
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:17,711
You know what, mate?
You're taller than I am.

1409
01:16:17,745 --> 01:16:19,346
Longer arms and all that.

1410
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:22,817
I'll hold the bottom.
You get up there and grab it.

1411
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:41,102
-All good?
-Yeah.

1412
01:16:53,247 --> 01:16:54,715
Whoop.

1413
01:16:54,748 --> 01:16:56,183
Sorry, mate. It slipped.

1414
01:16:56,217 --> 01:16:58,052
Don't worry, I've got you.

1415
01:17:11,765 --> 01:17:14,802
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Careful, mate. Careful.

1416
01:17:14,835 --> 01:17:16,137
That's on you.

1417
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:17,905
You all right?

1418
01:17:17,938 --> 01:17:19,106
Whoa.

1419
01:17:27,181 --> 01:17:28,716
Oh, no.

1420
01:17:29,917 --> 01:17:31,785
Oh, I'm so sorry, Agnes.

1421
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:34,655
I think an animal
must have got to him.

1422
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:40,060
You all right?

1423
01:17:40,094 --> 01:17:40,895
Mm.

1424
01:17:40,928 --> 01:17:42,963
It's okay.

1425
01:17:42,997 --> 01:17:45,966
We'll get him home
and get him all fixed up.

1426
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,735
Well, thank you for coming.

1427
01:17:47,768 --> 01:17:49,436
-Oh, say goodbye to Agnes.
-Bye, Ciara.

1428
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:52,239
Come here, big man.
Hug it up. Yeah.

1429
01:17:54,074 --> 01:17:55,309
We won't leave you.

1430
01:17:55,342 --> 01:17:57,144
You be safe on those roads,
all right?

1431
01:17:57,178 --> 01:17:58,913
-Ant?
-Hey, you don't get away.

1432
01:17:58,946 --> 01:18:00,214
Come here.

1433
01:18:03,884 --> 01:18:05,219
Yeah.

1434
01:18:12,026 --> 01:18:13,294
All right.

1435
01:18:13,327 --> 01:18:16,830
Well, next time
you guys are in London,

1436
01:18:16,864 --> 01:18:18,032
just give us a...

1437
01:18:18,065 --> 01:18:19,400
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

1438
01:18:19,433 --> 01:18:21,468
Yeah, you guys let us know
when you get there.

1439
01:18:21,502 --> 01:18:24,038
You could send me a...
little text.

1440
01:18:29,544 --> 01:18:31,212
Absolutely.

1441
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:33,914
Except you won't, will you?

1442
01:18:33,948 --> 01:18:36,183
I'm sorry?

1443
01:18:37,017 --> 01:18:40,721
You're still not being
completely honest, are you?

1444
01:18:47,261 --> 01:18:49,296
No, we're not.

1445
01:18:50,364 --> 01:18:52,166
We've been lying to you.

1446
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:54,868
I mean, we're not gonna
invite you to London, are we?

1447
01:18:54,902 --> 01:18:56,503
We're never gonna
see you again because

1448
01:18:56,538 --> 01:18:58,906
Ben and I,

1449
01:18:58,939 --> 01:19:00,841
we won't be together.

1450
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:06,880
I betrayed Ben with someone else

1451
01:19:06,914 --> 01:19:11,085
because I was deeply unhappy
in my marriage.

1452
01:19:12,587 --> 01:19:14,855
And, uh, I've apologized,

1453
01:19:14,888 --> 01:19:16,857
but it has become clear
this weekend

1454
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:22,830
that maybe Ben and I
can't get past this.

1455
01:19:26,534 --> 01:19:28,168
Wow.

1456
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:31,171
Honesty.

1457
01:19:31,205 --> 01:19:32,373
Finally.

1458
01:19:34,074 --> 01:19:37,411
We believe honesty is the
first step to fixing things,

1459
01:19:37,444 --> 01:19:39,013
and we think you can.

1460
01:19:39,046 --> 01:19:41,849
Ben told me he wants to.

1461
01:19:42,584 --> 01:19:44,885
Ben loves you very much, Louise.

1462
01:19:46,387 --> 01:19:48,856
I'm sorry. I don't know
why I said all that.

1463
01:19:48,889 --> 01:19:50,224
No.

1464
01:19:50,257 --> 01:19:52,960
No, it's good to get it
all out.

1465
01:19:52,993 --> 01:19:54,895
I think we should go.

1466
01:19:54,928 --> 01:19:57,131
Yeah, we'll send you
the bill for the therapy.

1467
01:19:57,164 --> 01:19:59,433
And we'll see you both
in London.

1468
01:19:59,466 --> 01:20:01,001
Yeah.

1469
01:20:01,902 --> 01:20:05,806
Ant, could you get
the gate for us?

1470
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:10,044
Ant!

1471
01:20:15,115 --> 01:20:16,450
No need, mate.

1472
01:20:28,563 --> 01:20:30,364
All right.

1473
01:20:44,111 --> 01:20:47,047
All right, everybody,
just stay nice and calm.

1474
01:20:47,081 --> 01:20:49,316
-What about Ant?
-We're gonna come back for him.

1475
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:50,585
We can't leave him.

1476
01:20:50,618 --> 01:20:53,087
Baby, if we don't get away,
we can't help him.

1477
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,022
Okay? You understand that?

1478
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:58,926
All right. Just smile and wave.

1479
01:20:58,959 --> 01:21:00,861
Bye.

1480
01:21:11,138 --> 01:21:12,339
Dad! Dad, stop!

1481
01:21:12,373 --> 01:21:14,676
-What?
-He-he threw Ant in the lake!

1482
01:21:14,709 --> 01:21:17,010
Shit!

1483
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:22,116
Goddamn it!
All right, take the wheel.

1484
01:21:22,149 --> 01:21:24,151
-Just drive!
-Ben!

1485
01:21:32,226 --> 01:21:33,994
Mom, stop!

1486
01:21:44,572 --> 01:21:46,206
Ant!

1487
01:22:11,298 --> 01:22:14,067
What do we want here?
We want... pay and transfer?

1488
01:22:14,101 --> 01:22:16,538
200 grand. Fucking tasty.

1489
01:22:16,571 --> 01:22:20,542
Uh, make transfer,
pay new payee and done.

1490
01:22:20,575 --> 01:22:23,578
You're never gonna
get away with this.

1491
01:22:23,611 --> 01:22:26,447
Mike's already got a buyer
for your car.

1492
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,717
Next week, you're gonna send
an email to your landlord

1493
01:22:29,751 --> 01:22:31,418
saying you're moving home.

1494
01:22:31,452 --> 01:22:33,454
You'll send another to the
school saying the same thing.

1495
01:22:33,487 --> 01:22:35,623
You don't know your neighbors,
got no fucking job.

1496
01:22:35,657 --> 01:22:38,492
Nobody's gonna miss you
in a place like London.

1497
01:22:39,359 --> 01:22:41,094
Look, you can have
whatever you want.

1498
01:22:41,128 --> 01:22:42,597
Just please don't hurt
my family.

1499
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:44,198
Oh, your perfect fucking family?

1500
01:22:44,231 --> 01:22:45,767
You don't even love 'em, mate.

1501
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,368
If you did, you'd have left him
in the pond with his parents.

1502
01:22:48,402 --> 01:22:50,137
Don't worry, mate,
you'll be with them soon.

1503
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:53,508
Full amount. Transfer.

1504
01:22:58,145 --> 01:23:00,214
Why are you doing this?

1505
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:05,085
Because you let us.

1506
01:23:08,523 --> 01:23:11,124
You fucking people.

1507
01:23:11,793 --> 01:23:14,194
With your gas-free Teslas

1508
01:23:14,228 --> 01:23:17,364
and your... line-caught tuna.

1509
01:23:18,198 --> 01:23:21,301
Giving yourself a gold star
because you made friends

1510
01:23:21,335 --> 01:23:24,004
with a couple
with a disabled kid.

1511
01:23:27,074 --> 01:23:29,443
Makes me fucking sick.

1512
01:23:31,846 --> 01:23:33,247
Agnes, love.

1513
01:23:34,147 --> 01:23:36,216
Roll that sleeve up, yeah?

1514
01:23:37,184 --> 01:23:39,821
It's-it's all right.
It's all right.

1515
01:23:39,854 --> 01:23:41,623
It's just veterinary ketamine.

1516
01:23:41,656 --> 01:23:42,824
Not gonna kill her.

1517
01:23:42,857 --> 01:23:44,692
It's better to sedate.

1518
01:23:44,726 --> 01:23:48,128
Otherwise, they wriggle around
and make a right bloody mess.

1519
01:23:48,161 --> 01:23:49,396
Ant will tell you.

1520
01:23:49,429 --> 01:23:51,198
It's just, except he can't.

1521
01:23:51,231 --> 01:23:53,668
Ciara, please.

1522
01:23:53,701 --> 01:23:55,703
No, you can't let him do this.

1523
01:23:57,170 --> 01:24:00,440
It was her
who first wanted a kid.

1524
01:24:00,474 --> 01:24:03,711
Just never seems to work out,
does it, love?

1525
01:24:03,745 --> 01:24:05,345
Maybe this time.

1526
01:24:05,379 --> 01:24:07,114
Yeah.

1527
01:24:10,885 --> 01:24:12,185
Look, Paddy, please.

1528
01:24:12,219 --> 01:24:13,588
Hands behind your back.

1529
01:24:31,338 --> 01:24:32,674
Louise.

1530
01:24:32,707 --> 01:24:34,308
Louise, please don't leave me
here with him.

1531
01:24:34,341 --> 01:24:36,578
-Ant!
-You've seen how he hurts me.

1532
01:24:36,611 --> 01:24:37,477
I'm a victim here, too.

1533
01:24:37,512 --> 01:24:39,581
Please, please, please.
I was his first!

1534
01:24:39,614 --> 01:24:41,148
I was Agnes's age!

1535
01:24:41,181 --> 01:24:43,585
Please, you've got
to believe me!

1536
01:24:43,618 --> 01:24:45,185
Please don't leave me here
with him!

1537
01:24:45,218 --> 01:24:46,486
Fuck her.

1538
01:24:46,521 --> 01:24:48,656
-Come on. Come on.
-Please! Louise, please!

1539
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:50,090
Come on.

1540
01:24:52,225 --> 01:24:53,226
Get in.

1541
01:25:01,903 --> 01:25:02,870
Oh!

1542
01:25:02,904 --> 01:25:04,471
Shit. Who is it?

1543
01:25:06,941 --> 01:25:09,611
-Shit! Shit!
-Oh, my God!

1544
01:25:13,313 --> 01:25:14,314
In the house!

1545
01:25:14,348 --> 01:25:15,583
There's a landline in the house!

1546
01:25:20,755 --> 01:25:22,255
Bolt the shutters!

1547
01:25:29,296 --> 01:25:31,365
-The fuck!
-Paddy.

1548
01:25:31,398 --> 01:25:32,700
Fuck off!

1549
01:25:32,734 --> 01:25:34,334
This is your fucking fault.

1550
01:25:34,368 --> 01:25:35,670
You nearly fucking shot me!

1551
01:25:37,705 --> 01:25:41,274
Baby, I need you with me.

1552
01:25:53,554 --> 01:25:54,689
Paddy, mate!

1553
01:25:55,556 --> 01:25:56,824
Mate, they're in your house.

1554
01:25:56,858 --> 01:25:58,458
They're going nowhere.

1555
01:25:58,492 --> 01:26:00,260
Mate, I don't mind
providing services

1556
01:26:00,293 --> 01:26:02,396
and taking my share, but this...

1557
01:26:02,429 --> 01:26:04,766
-They see your face, Mike?
-Yeah.

1558
01:26:04,799 --> 01:26:07,669
Then you are in this,
you like it or not.

1559
01:26:08,836 --> 01:26:10,705
Okay.

1560
01:26:10,738 --> 01:26:13,675
Um, um, uh, telephone,
telephone! Come on.

1561
01:26:13,708 --> 01:26:15,543
Thank you.

1562
01:26:15,576 --> 01:26:17,679
Um...

1563
01:26:17,712 --> 01:26:18,680
Okay.

1564
01:26:18,713 --> 01:26:22,617
Oh, no, fuck!
It's, um, uh, nine-nine-nine.

1565
01:26:27,021 --> 01:26:28,656
Anything?

1566
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:30,591
-Uh-huh.
-Emergency. Which service?

1567
01:26:33,795 --> 01:26:35,295
What? What?

1568
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:37,699
It's gone dead.

1569
01:26:37,732 --> 01:26:39,600
-Um...
-Fuck.

1570
01:26:42,937 --> 01:26:44,539
Okay.

1571
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:50,545
Ben?

1572
01:26:50,578 --> 01:26:51,646
Look.

1573
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:53,881
If we got out there
and then down into the woods,

1574
01:26:53,915 --> 01:26:56,383
-I mean, in the dark, they...
-No. L-Louise, they have guns.

1575
01:26:56,416 --> 01:26:57,885
Okay? They-they hunt at night.

1576
01:26:57,919 --> 01:27:00,755
Okay, if they get inside,
they are gonna kill us.

1577
01:27:01,622 --> 01:27:03,490
Louise, I don't know what to do.

1578
01:27:03,524 --> 01:27:04,792
I don't know.

1579
01:27:04,826 --> 01:27:06,961
I... I don't know.
I'm so sorry, Louise.

1580
01:27:06,994 --> 01:27:08,328
I-I should-- I-- Fuck.

1581
01:27:08,361 --> 01:27:09,630
I-I should've listened to you.

1582
01:27:09,664 --> 01:27:11,032
-It's okay.
-No, it's not okay!

1583
01:27:11,065 --> 01:27:12,399
Like, I should have
not let us come.

1584
01:27:12,432 --> 01:27:13,534
I-- We shouldn't have stayed.

1585
01:27:13,568 --> 01:27:16,537
Ben! Stop it!

1586
01:27:16,571 --> 01:27:18,539
Listen to me.

1587
01:27:18,573 --> 01:27:20,373
Look at your daughter.

1588
01:27:21,042 --> 01:27:22,844
Your family needs you.

1589
01:27:31,052 --> 01:27:32,587
Dad, I don't like it.

1590
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:34,622
-Okay.
-Look, it's okay, honey.

1591
01:27:34,655 --> 01:27:37,390
They're just trying
to scare us. All right?

1592
01:27:37,424 --> 01:27:38,960
It's okay, guys.

Louise. Louise.

1603
01:28:24,672 --> 01:28:26,707
Look, the thatched roof
above the barn.

1604
01:28:26,741 --> 01:28:30,011
If we could light that on fire,
then someone might see it.

1605
01:28:30,044 --> 01:28:31,846
Oh, my gosh.

1606
01:28:31,879 --> 01:28:34,749
-Is it gonna work?
-Oh, God, I don't know.

1607

-All right.
-Okay. Okay.

1610
01:28:41,589 --> 01:28:44,058
Oh, God. Fast. Go.

1611
01:28:44,091 --> 01:28:46,627
Ben, go! Jesus!

1612
01:28:51,866 --> 01:28:53,034
Okay.

1613
01:28:57,572 --> 01:28:59,372
-Jesus! Oh! Oh, my gosh!
-Oh, shit! Louise!

1614
01:28:59,406 --> 01:29:00,808
-Oh, no, Ben! Pick it up!
-Throw it! Oh!

1615
01:29:01,843 --> 01:29:03,544
All right, shoot the gun,
and I'll throw it.

1616
01:29:03,578 --> 01:29:05,112
-It's our last shot.
-Just shoot the gun, okay?

1617
01:29:05,146 --> 01:29:06,647
Okay!

1618
01:29:13,154 --> 01:29:14,589
Oh, fuck!

1619
01:29:16,157 --> 01:29:17,992
Okay, go. Go, go.

1620
01:29:25,132 --> 01:29:26,834
Did you get it?

1621
01:29:28,501 --> 01:29:30,838
Yeah, honey. Help's on the way.

1622
01:29:31,873 --> 01:29:35,408
Okay. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.

1623
01:29:37,712 --> 01:29:39,446
Fuck!

1624
01:29:40,915 --> 01:29:42,683
Mate, your fucking car's
on fire. Let's finish it, eh?

1625
01:29:42,717 --> 01:29:44,085
We've got them
on the hook, Mike.

1626
01:29:44,118 --> 01:29:45,853
I told you, you should
just top them first thing.

1627
01:29:45,887 --> 01:29:47,555
Why do you do this,
play with your food?

1628
01:29:47,588 --> 01:29:48,823
You're like my mum's cat.

1629
01:29:48,856 --> 01:29:53,393
You go and you get
on that roof, yeah?

1630
01:30:00,201 --> 01:30:02,469
Okay, you guys sit tight.

1631
01:30:02,502 --> 01:30:03,871
You, too, Hoppy.

1632
01:30:03,905 --> 01:30:06,874
Now, you don't move
and you don't make a sound

1633
01:30:06,908 --> 01:30:09,744
until you hear
my voice again, okay?

1634
01:30:09,777 --> 01:30:11,579
Okay.

1635
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,487
Ben, mate?

1636
01:30:57,625 --> 01:30:59,093
That you in there?

1637
01:30:59,894 --> 01:31:02,229
You gonna give me
a little dance, Ben?

1638
01:31:03,297 --> 01:31:06,567
You gonna step up or are you
gonna let us shit all over you

1639
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:09,937
like that fellow
on your wife's phone?

1640
01:31:09,971 --> 01:31:11,238
Ben?

1641
01:31:11,272 --> 01:31:14,642
If it was just
you and him, right,

1642
01:31:14,675 --> 01:31:17,244
you've got a gun
against his head,

1643
01:31:17,278 --> 01:31:19,613
what would you do?

1644
01:31:28,122 --> 01:31:31,692
Oh, you've blown up my car,
you cheeky cunt.

1645
01:31:31,726 --> 01:31:32,893
What was that?

1646
01:31:32,927 --> 01:31:35,629
You're gonna have to pay
for that, Ben.

1647
01:31:35,663 --> 01:31:37,565
Coming in, Ben!

1648
01:32:03,691 --> 01:32:05,593
It's the roof.

1649
01:32:07,928 --> 01:32:09,530
Ben.

1650
01:32:10,197 --> 01:32:12,033
Honey.

1651
01:32:49,003 --> 01:32:51,605
Ant!

1652
01:32:52,807 --> 01:32:54,341
Where are you, boy?

1653
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:56,777
I know you can hear me!

1654
01:33:04,718 --> 01:33:06,854
Oh, you fuck.

1655
01:33:55,436 --> 01:33:58,706
Not gonna pretend I'm not angry.

1656
01:34:18,425 --> 01:34:21,295
Fuck!

1657
01:34:27,268 --> 01:34:29,170
Ah, ya fuck.

1658
01:34:59,099 --> 01:35:01,302
Paddy!

1659
01:35:06,373 --> 01:35:08,275
Where is she?

1660
01:35:08,309 --> 01:35:10,010
Through there.

1661
01:35:12,346 --> 01:35:13,515
Check the cupboard.

1662
01:35:13,548 --> 01:35:15,716
Okay.

1663
01:35:38,005 --> 01:35:40,107
Ant, love?

1664
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:42,376
If you make some noise
and show us where you are,

1665
01:35:42,409 --> 01:35:43,978
we'll go easy on you.

1666
01:35:44,011 --> 01:35:46,847
No reason we can't
keep you both.

1667
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,382
Don't...

1668
01:35:48,415 --> 01:35:49,850
and I'm gonna put you feet first

1669
01:35:49,883 --> 01:35:51,986
through the fucking
wood chipper!

1670
01:35:52,853 --> 01:35:54,255
Let's go up.

1671
01:36:45,005 --> 01:36:47,141
You fucking...

1672
01:36:48,610 --> 01:36:50,612
Go! Go, go, go!

1673
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,448
Go! Go! Go!

1674
01:36:54,481 --> 01:36:55,449
Oh, shit!

1675
01:36:55,482 --> 01:36:57,818
Go, go. Right there.

1676
01:37:00,888 --> 01:37:02,489
Water.

1677
01:37:02,524 --> 01:37:04,091
Oh, fuck. Water!

1678
01:37:04,124 --> 01:37:05,893
Come on, kids. Go in.

1679
01:37:07,061 --> 01:37:09,096
Go in. That way, that way!

1680
01:37:44,365 --> 01:37:46,166
Holy shit.

1681
01:37:50,037 --> 01:37:52,106
Just grab his keys.

1682
01:37:52,139 --> 01:37:54,308
-What? What?
-His car keys.

1683
01:37:59,547 --> 01:38:01,382
Through the loft. The loft.

1684
01:38:01,415 --> 01:38:03,016
Come on.

1685
01:38:08,155 --> 01:38:10,290
Can you see?

1686
01:38:10,324 --> 01:38:11,291
I can see.

1687
01:38:11,325 --> 01:38:12,660
Look, look.

1688
01:38:12,694 --> 01:38:14,562
You... you have to do this.

1689
01:38:14,596 --> 01:38:16,096
You have to go now.

1690
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:17,931
You got to get after them,
all right?

1691
01:38:17,965 --> 01:38:20,968
This is your fuckup, love.
You go fix it or it's over.

1692
01:38:21,001 --> 01:38:22,369
Give me it.

1693
01:38:27,575 --> 01:38:29,910
Upstairs.

1694
01:38:32,714 --> 01:38:34,281
Oh.

1695
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:39,052
Okay. Oh, thank God.

1696
01:38:40,154 --> 01:38:42,456
-Okay. Okay.
-Oh.

1697
01:38:46,528 --> 01:38:48,128
Dad!

1698
01:38:50,330 --> 01:38:51,666
Are you okay?

1699
01:38:51,699 --> 01:38:54,435
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay. Okay.

1700
01:38:54,468 --> 01:38:56,136
Come on.

1701
01:38:56,170 --> 01:38:57,672
There you go.

1702
01:39:11,351 --> 01:39:12,587
-All right. All right.
-No.

1703
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:14,087
All right, just be careful.

1704
01:39:14,756 --> 01:39:16,691
-Okay.
-Okay.

1705
01:39:16,724 --> 01:39:18,992
Get on the ladder.

1706
01:39:42,517 --> 01:39:44,351
Ciara?

1707
01:39:44,384 --> 01:39:45,753
Ciara!

1708
01:39:45,787 --> 01:39:48,088
-Dad! Help me!
-Aggie!

1709
01:39:48,121 --> 01:39:49,657
-Dad, please!
-I got you!

1710
01:40:02,236 --> 01:40:04,438
I got you. I got you.

1711
01:40:09,777 --> 01:40:12,580
Oh, God. Are you okay?

1712
01:40:39,541 --> 01:40:41,141
Oh, my God.

1713
01:41:08,502 --> 01:41:11,171
All right.
Go hide behind the car.

1714
01:41:11,204 --> 01:41:13,641
Hey, go through the yard.

1715
01:41:20,515 --> 01:41:21,516
Hey.

1716
01:41:33,695 --> 01:41:35,462
Go. Go.

1717
01:41:35,495 --> 01:41:38,600
Take Ant back to the car.
I'll be right behind you.

1718
01:41:39,399 --> 01:41:41,101
We go together.

1719
01:42:02,255 --> 01:42:04,324
Oh, God.

1720
01:42:06,828 --> 01:42:08,495
Ciara?

1721
01:42:08,529 --> 01:42:11,231
Hey! Hey!

1722
01:42:11,264 --> 01:42:13,133
You throw that gun, Ben.

1723
01:42:14,401 --> 01:42:16,203
No.

1724
01:42:18,205 --> 01:42:19,907
Oh, baby.

1725
01:42:19,941 --> 01:42:22,409
Ciara, my darling?

1726
01:42:25,412 --> 01:42:27,782
Ciara. Oh, my darling.

1727
01:42:27,815 --> 01:42:30,384
Oh, please. Please.

1728
01:42:30,417 --> 01:42:32,754
Do whatever you want to us.

1729
01:42:32,787 --> 01:42:34,922
But please...

1730
01:42:34,956 --> 01:42:36,624
This peach?

1731
01:42:37,859 --> 01:42:39,794
You think I'm gonna hurt her?

1732
01:42:41,829 --> 01:42:44,264
You took my Ciara away from me.

1733
01:42:45,499 --> 01:42:48,502
She's all I've got
to take care of me now.

1734
01:42:51,438 --> 01:42:53,641
But I promise you both...

1735
01:42:55,308 --> 01:42:57,377
...we'll look after each other.

1736
01:42:57,411 --> 01:42:59,379
-No!
-Fuck!

1737
01:43:06,988 --> 01:43:08,823
Oh, God!

1738
01:43:22,003 --> 01:43:23,470
Okay.

1739
01:43:39,787 --> 01:43:41,789
Ant, come on.

1740
01:43:43,725 --> 01:43:44,859
Ant.

1741
01:43:44,892 --> 01:43:46,794
Come on.
