<i>On December 26th, 2004, the deadliest tsunami 
on record hit the South East Coast of Asia.</i>

2
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:28,665
<i>The lives of countless families all 
over the world changed forever.</i>

3
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:39,246
<i>This is the true story of 
one of those families.</i>

4
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:32,269
Oh, God! 

5
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:33,782
Did you.... 

6
00:02:34,724 --> 00:02:39,164
- ...Did you set the alarm before we left? 
- Yes, it was the last thing I did! 

7
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:46,757
No, I was the last one to leave. 

8
00:02:47,012 --> 00:02:49,122
I was the last one to leave 
and I'm sure I didn't set it. 

9
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:52,049
No darling, I was the last one out... 

10
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:54,060
and I did, I promise. 

11
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:56,217
_ are You sure? 
- Yep! 

12
00:02:56,704 --> 00:02:57,855
Okay! 

13
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:03,669
No, no, I was the last one 
'cause I went back in. 

14
00:03:03,794 --> 00:03:05,377
And that means the alarm is not set. 

15
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:06,655
Cause I didn't set it. 

16
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:10,623
Well, I guess that means that we be coming 
home to a large bunch of hippies... 

17
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:12,129
...sleeping in our bed. 

18
00:03:12,187 --> 00:03:13,707
What? Just like your old college days? 

19
00:03:17,082 --> 00:03:19,757
It's all right. It's fine. 
It's just turbulence, Maria. 

20
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,480
<i>Please Turn Off Electronic Devices.</i>

21
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,524
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we are about 
to begin our descent to Phuket Airport.</i>

22
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:28,074
<i>The local time is 1:30 in the afternoon...</i>

23
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:30,714
What are you doing? It's time to sit down, 
we are about to land, darling. 

24
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,490
Lucas won't talk to me. 

25
00:03:32,558 --> 00:03:34,330
<i>Please fasten your seatbelts...</i>

26
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:35,998
<i>...and return your seat to 
the upright position.</i>

27
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:37,311
Take my seat. 

28
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:42,790
- What did I do? I didn't do anything. 
- It's all right. Just sit down and stop worrying. 

29
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,669
Buckle up! 

30
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:49,884
Sit down please, madam! 

31
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:51,726
Lucas. 

32
00:03:55,246 --> 00:03:56,684
_ Lucas. 
- What?! 

33
00:03:56,746 --> 00:04:00,151
You know you could try being a bit nicer to 
your brother, he's just scared. 

34
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,126
_ so What else is new, everything scares him? 

35
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:09,080
I wonder who he takes after. 

36
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:32,456
<i>KHAOLAK, THAILAND CHRISTMAS EVE</i>

37
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:36,172
Take your stuff. Don't forget all your bags. 

38
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:40,434
Have you been to Khao Lak before? 

39
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:42,046
No, it's our first time. 

40
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:44,495
This is the best holiday season ever. 

41
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:47,716
All resorts are full, 
but this area is really quiet. 

42
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:48,950
Great for families. 

43
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:52,361
The Orchid Beach Resort is brand new. 
We just opened a week ago. 

44
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:53,850
- You'll love it here. 
_ all Right. 

45
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:58,355
I'm sorry, but we made a booking 
on the third floor, the sea view room. 

46
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:00,739
I know. We are sorry, 
that was a mistake. 

47
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:01,845
But we feel... 

48
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,094
you might like this better. 

49
00:05:06,577 --> 00:05:08,207
_ Where Do You Come from? 
_ Japan. 

50
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,914
You don't look Japanese. 

51
00:05:10,372 --> 00:05:13,921
No, well, I work for a big company there, 
and we move around a lot, you know. 

52
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:15,609
And you, you don't work? 

53
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:17,538
I'm a doctor. 

54
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:21,323
Not practicing right now. 
Just taking care of the kids. 

55
00:05:21,465 --> 00:05:24,216
I see, you got promoted. 

56
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:29,778
Well, that's nice, isn't it? 

57
00:05:29,874 --> 00:05:31,082
- Mom! 
_ Yes. 

58
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:34,614
_ can I have one of these, please? 
_ Lucas, if You are thirsty, will You just... 

59
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:38,494
_ Drink some juice or a glass of water. 
_ Exactly. 

60
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:41,330
_ Boys, Come And see this. 
_ Come on. 

61
00:05:41,443 --> 00:05:42,518
Look. 

62
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:46,848
_ Yeah, look. Look at this. 
- Oh! 

63
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:48,376
Isn't it great? 

64
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:52,132
_ Dad, can We swim in there? 
_ Yeah, We can go swimming. Yeah. 

65
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:36,079
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

<i>...five, four, three...</i>

<i>...two, one!</i>

69
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:47,999
Go! 
Go! 

70
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:49,833
Wow! 

71
00:07:06,461 --> 00:07:08,091
That one isn't going up! 

72
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,653
_ Yes, It is. 
_ It is going up. 

73
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,641
No, it's not. 

74
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:14,732
It's going a different way than the others. 

75
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:17,294
Yeah! 
Yeah! 

76
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:21,163
- It's catching up. 
- Yeah, it's catching up. 

77
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:23,957
No, Dad, it's going 
in the opposite direction. 

78
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,507
We got any of that wine left? 

79
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,865
They're fast asleep. 

80
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,481
Good morning. 

81
00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:35,305
Good morning. 

82
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:37,223
Ahh! 
Get off! 

83
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:39,498
- Wake up! 
_ What are You doing? 

84
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,963
- It's Christmas! 

85
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,005
It's Christmas morning! 

86
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,185
It's Christmas! 

87
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,761
Coins! 

88
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,188
The money's leading this way. 

89
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,481
The money's going outside! 

90
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,261
No, no, no! 

91
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,805
Wait, wait! One at a time! 

92
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,151
Oh! 

93
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,541
A telescope! 

94
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,746
It's the complete nova stars... 

95
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,151
It's like, you can stick on your ceiling. 

96
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,725
- It's the whole Milky Way. 
_ And Then They light up? 

97
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,750
Oh, look at this gorgeous scarf! I love it. 

98
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,927
_ Thank You, darling. 
- That's all right, my love. 

99
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,321
I mean Santa Claus. 

100
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,281
What have you got, wee man? 

101
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,360
_ a ball. 
_ a ball? 

102
00:09:27,424 --> 00:09:28,527
Goal! 

103
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:25,959
I can't get to sleep. 

104
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:37,341
- Must be jet lag! 
_ Yeah. Sure. 

105
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:43,503
Can we go outside and watch the stars? 

106
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:46,945
Maybe tomorrow. 

107
00:10:51,054 --> 00:10:53,825
Just close your eyes and 
think of something nice. 

108
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:18,987
Mom, do you want to play ball with me? 

109
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:21,371
In a minute, darling, play with Lucas. 

110
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:34,564
- I can't believe you. You're hopeless! 
_ What? 

111
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,862
I'm gonna hide that thing 
and forget where I put it. 

112
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:41,218
I was just checking to see about the house 
we put a bid on in Japan. 

113
00:11:41,444 --> 00:11:43,016
Liar. 

114
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,460
The truth is I got a text 

115
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,060
saying that Yunioshi has been given 

116
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,300
a two-year extension on his contract. 

117
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,900
Which means there will be 
two of us doing the same job. 

118
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,860
And that can only really mean one thing. 

119
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,589
They can't fire you. 

120
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,620
That would be too expensive. Don't worry. 

121
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,463
Well, I do worry because 

122
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,273
we can't afford to lose this job, can we? 

123
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,447
Hey, Dad! Come and play with us! 

124
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,306
I could go back to work. Maybe it's time. 

125
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,828
_ in Japan? 
_ No. 

126
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,948
Oh, you want to go home? 

127
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,187
It's not the worst idea, is it? 

128
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,580
Well, we should think about it. 

129
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,447
But I'm gonna play with the boys now, so... 

130
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,900
Here, Dad! 

131
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,060
Dad, they are the worst trunks ever! 

132
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,142
- Awful! 
- They're awful, Dad! 

133
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,887
- No, you're the awful! 
- Yes, they are! 

134
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,786
- Boys! Oh! 
- Fish! 

135
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,100
- Try to splash 'em! 
- Ha, ha, beat you! 

136
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,700
Lucas! 

137
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,300
Oh, no! 

138
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,900
Go get it, Lucas! Go on! 

139
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,348
- Henry, the boys! 
- Lucas! 

140
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,940
Dad! 

141
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,420
Lucas! 

142
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,710
Mom! Help! 

143
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,744
- Lucas! 
- Mom! 

144
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,950
- Lucas! 
- Help me! 

145
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,980
Lucas! 

146
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,462
Help me! Help! 

147
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,908
Get me out of this, Mom! 

148
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,069
Lucas! Stay there! 

149
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,620
Mom! 

150
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,509
Hold on! Hold on! 

151
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,340
Mom! 

152
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,742
- Mom! Swim towards me! 
- Be careful! 

153
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,620
Grab that mattress! 

154
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,660
- Lucas, grab that mattress! 
- Mom! 

155
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,307
Lucas! Swim! 

156
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,420
Mom! 

157
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,740
Mom! 

158
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,780
- I want to go home! 
- Grab my hand! 

159
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,980
Mom! 

160
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,620
Come on! 

161
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,020
Grab on. 

162
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,620
- Mom! 
- Lucas! 

163
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,620
Lucas! 

164
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,580
Lucas! 

165
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,180
Come on! 

166
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,500
Lucas! 

167
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,700
- Lucas! 
- Mom! 

168
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,428
Someone help! Someone help! 

169
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,060
Lucas! 

170
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,220
Lucas, go under! 

171
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,420
Mom! 

172
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,180
Mom... 

173
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,780
Mom! 

174
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,500
No... 

175
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,060
Mom! 

176
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,180
Mom. Mom. 

177
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,260
Mom... Mom! 

178
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,540
Mom! 

179
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,460
- Lucas! 
- Mom! 

180
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,927
Never do that to me again, Mom. 

181
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,029
Never do that to me again, Mom. 

182
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,367
- I'm here. 
_ Never Do that to me again. 

183
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,927
We have to find somewhere safe. 

184
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,831
It's okay. I'm here. 

185
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,940
Mom... 

186
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,980
Mom, look, that tree. That tree over there. 

187
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,065
Yes. Yes. This is perfect. It's perfect. 

188
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,820
Careful, Lucas. 

189
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,904
Don't... Don't move. 

190
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,070
Stay really still. 

191
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,260
I thought I was a brave kid, Mom. 

192
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,780
I'm scared. 

193
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,500
Come here. Come here. 

194
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,110
I'm scared, too. 

195
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,340
Is it over? 

196
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,060
Is it over? 

197
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,626
I don't know. I don't know. 

198
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,860
Mom? 

199
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,020
What? 

200
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,309
You're bleeding, Mom. 

201
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,181
_ Oh, God. 

202
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,580
It's okay. 

203
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,500
- I can't see you like this. 
- It's okay, it's okay. 

204
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,151
Sorry. I just... Sorry. 

205
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,580
You go first. 

206
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,873
That tree there, the big one. 
Do you think we can climb it? 

207
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,300
Okay, let's go. 

208
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,505
_ Wait. Did You hear that? 

209
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,660
- There's nothing we can do. 
_ Wait... 

210
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,820
We are almost there. 
We have to get to safety. 

211
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,180
No, we have to help that boy. 

212
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,500
Mom, if another wave catches 
us down here, we will die. 

213
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,583
We have to climb that tree 
right now. Come on. 

214
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,340
Where are you? 

215
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,786
Mom, look at you! We need help! 

216
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,824
We cannot risk it. 

217
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,981
We can't risk it, Mom. Come on. 

218
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,700
Listen... 

219
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,347
What if that boy was Simon or Thomas? 

220
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,182
What if they needed help? 

221
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,700
You'd want someone 
to help them, wouldn't you? 

222
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,782
Simon and Thomas are dead! 

223
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,727
Even if it's the last thing we do. 

224
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,629
Where are you? 

225
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,508
Look there, Mom! I see him! 

226
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,300
Are you okay? 

227
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,501
- Yeah, he's okay. He's okay. 

228
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,940
What's your name? 

229
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,742
I'm Lucas. What's your name? 

230
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,740
_ Daniel. 
_ Okay, Daniel. Okay, Come on. 

231
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,100
You're gonna be okay. 
We're gonna get you out. Okay? 

232
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,620
Lift him up. 

233
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,740
- It's all right. 
- It's okay. It's okay. 

234
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,340
It's all right. 

235
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,220
Are you okay? 

236
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,150
Okay. Are you okay? 

237
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,224
- It's okay, it's okay! 

238
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,621
Don't worry. Everything's okay. 

239
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,750
Okay? You stay here. I'll be back. Okay? 

240
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,340
Mom, coming down. Just give me a second. 

241
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,990
No. I can do it. 

242
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,687
- No, Mom, I'm coming down. 
- I can do it, Lucas! 

243
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,068
Just stay there. Please. 

244
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,224
Mom? Mom... 

245
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,300
Okay... 

246
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,660
Okay... 

247
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,588
Thank you. Thank you. 

248
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,870
Did you hear that? 

249
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,065
Mom, look! Look, they're coming for us! 

250
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,387
Hey! Over here! 

251
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,060
Hey! 

252
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,584
Climb down, Lucas. 

253
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,987
_ Lucas... 

254
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,308
Lucas! Please... 

255
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,062
No, no, no! God, please! No... 

256
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,660
Lucas? 

257
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,149
_ Lucas? 
- Mom, I'm here. 

258
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,426
Thank you so much. Thank you. 

259
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,780
Thank you. 

260
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,344
Thank you... 

261
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,826
Thank you. Thank you so much. 

262
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,420
My boys... 

263
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,901
I cannot see them, my boys... 

264
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,460
My boys. 

265
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,670
Okay, Okay. 

266
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,220
Don't let them take me 
anywhere without you. 

267
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,460
Don't worry, Mom. 

268
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,993
I'm not gonna leave you alone. I promise. 

269
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,860
Bye-bye. 

270
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:41,064
Where's Daniel? Daniel? 
Daniel. Lucas, where's Daniel? 

271
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,508
- I don't know. 
_ Daniel... 

272
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,269
Thank you. Thank you. 

273
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,415
Thank you. 

274
00:40:05,415 --> 00:40:07,015
Mom. 

275
00:40:12,655 --> 00:40:14,255
Lucas. 

276
00:40:15,855 --> 00:40:18,506
It's so cold in here. 

277
00:40:18,635 --> 00:40:20,585
It's not cold, Mom. 

278
00:40:24,995 --> 00:40:26,595
Don't move. 

279
00:40:27,315 --> 00:40:29,556
Mom? Mom, what's wrong? 

280
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:34,222
I need some antibiotics. 
Look in the cupboard. 

281
00:40:37,075 --> 00:40:38,675
Oh, God. 

282
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:41,555
I can't read the labels. They're all in Thai. 

283
00:40:41,555 --> 00:40:43,515
There's got to be some English. Look... 

284
00:40:43,515 --> 00:40:47,076
Look on the sides. Look carefully, Lucas. 

285
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:52,597
Thank God. Please. 

286
00:40:54,315 --> 00:40:55,915
See that boy? 

287
00:40:56,595 --> 00:40:59,862
I'm all he's got in the world. 
Do you understand? 

288
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:02,635
I'm a doctor, too. I've got a lot of bleeding. 

289
00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:04,635
You've got to stop it, please. 

290
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,401
I need some antibiotics. Please help. 

291
00:41:33,355 --> 00:41:34,515
Are you okay? 

292
00:41:34,515 --> 00:41:37,041
I lost my husband and two children. 

293
00:41:40,555 --> 00:41:42,422
If anything happens to me... 

294
00:42:15,195 --> 00:42:16,845
What color is it? 

295
00:42:17,315 --> 00:42:19,124
_ What? 
_ my leg. 

296
00:42:20,995 --> 00:42:22,595
Is it still red? 

297
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:25,439
Yeah. It's still red. 

298
00:42:26,155 --> 00:42:28,362
_ What does that mean? 

299
00:42:28,675 --> 00:42:31,758
It's good. As long as it doesn't turn black. 

300
00:42:34,995 --> 00:42:36,595
Here. 

301
00:42:38,115 --> 00:42:41,324
You need to eat something. Eat it. 

302
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:49,479
You're so bossy. 

303
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:53,717
I wonder who I take after. 

304
00:43:05,555 --> 00:43:07,155
Hello. 

305
00:43:08,555 --> 00:43:10,159
What's your name? 

306
00:43:14,715 --> 00:43:17,958
My name's Maria. And this is my son, Lucas. 

307
00:43:18,755 --> 00:43:20,405
What's your name? 

308
00:43:26,035 --> 00:43:27,635
Hey. 

309
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:30,283
Give her some tangerine. 

310
00:43:31,915 --> 00:43:33,724
She must be starving. 

311
00:43:43,995 --> 00:43:45,595
Be careful. 

312
00:43:45,595 --> 00:43:47,723
_ Be careful, Lucas. 

313
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,435
Turn your head to the side, please. 

314
00:43:50,435 --> 00:43:52,168
You'll choke if you don't. 

315
00:43:53,555 --> 00:43:56,435
Please, please, 
she needs help. Turn her head. 

316
00:43:56,435 --> 00:43:59,279
Help her, Lucas. Help her. Turn her head. 

317
00:44:01,195 --> 00:44:02,845
_ You okay? 

318
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:05,675
_ You okay? 

319
00:44:06,915 --> 00:44:08,515
_ Mom, are You okay? 

320
00:44:08,595 --> 00:44:11,804
Mom? Mom? Are you okay? 
What are you doing? 

321
00:44:13,515 --> 00:44:15,483
_ Mom, are You okay? 

322
00:44:18,955 --> 00:44:22,118
Stop it, Mom! That's enough! Mom, stop it! 

323
00:44:22,595 --> 00:44:24,279
_ Mom... 

324
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:27,515
Mom, stop it! 

325
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:47,204
Mom? Mom? 

326
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:05,475
Francesca! 

327
00:45:09,235 --> 00:45:10,835
Francesca! 

328
00:45:11,355 --> 00:45:12,955
Francesca! 

329
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:16,036
I need to go to the toilet. 

330
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:19,115
Please... 

331
00:45:23,475 --> 00:45:25,075
Please... 

332
00:45:29,355 --> 00:45:30,475
Please. 

333
00:45:30,475 --> 00:45:32,443
_ Lucas. 
- Somebody help me! 

334
00:45:32,515 --> 00:45:36,600
Look at this place. It's so busy in here. 

335
00:45:37,995 --> 00:45:40,262
You've got to go and do something. 

336
00:45:41,955 --> 00:45:44,561
Go and help people. You're good at it. 

337
00:45:45,235 --> 00:45:46,955
What do you want me to do? 

338
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:48,555
Something. 

339
00:45:49,675 --> 00:45:51,275
Anything. 

340
00:45:53,595 --> 00:45:55,075
Will you be all right? 

341
00:45:55,075 --> 00:45:56,675
Come on, Lucas. I'm... 

342
00:45:57,795 --> 00:45:59,684
I'm not going anywhere. 

343
00:46:01,955 --> 00:46:03,764
_ I promise. 
_ Okay. 

344
00:46:25,075 --> 00:46:26,675
BernstrÃ¶m! 

345
00:46:28,155 --> 00:46:30,237
Three! BernstrÃ¶m! 

346
00:46:32,995 --> 00:46:34,475
Hello? Help me. 

347
00:46:34,475 --> 00:46:36,742
BernstrÃ¶m! BernstrÃ¶m. From Sweden. 

348
00:46:37,595 --> 00:46:40,724
_ your family? 
_ Agda. Josef. MÃ¥rten. 

349
00:46:40,795 --> 00:46:41,955
You're looking for your family. 

350
00:46:41,955 --> 00:46:43,795
Have you seen them? BernstrÃ¶m! 

351
00:46:43,795 --> 00:46:46,924
Okay! Calm down. I will help you. Okay? 

352

Okay.

Excuse me? Excuse me.

I'm looking for my son. 

362
00:47:14,435 --> 00:47:15,795
Your son? 

363
00:47:15,795 --> 00:47:19,959

He'll be wondering where I am. 

364

00:47:35,675 --> 00:47:37,715
I'm sorry. What's your name again? 

371
00:47:37,715 --> 00:47:39,956
Anna Marie DeBrauwn, anyone? 

372
00:47:40,635 --> 00:47:42,239

373
00:47:42,795 --> 00:47:45,162

383
00:48:34,595 --> 00:48:36,195
Ja. 

384
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:39,315
I know your dad. 

385
00:48:39,715 --> 00:48:40,755
Pappa? 

386
00:48:40,755 --> 00:48:42,555
Yeah, your pappa. He's here. 

387
00:48:42,555 --> 00:48:44,715
- I'll bring him here, okay? 
_ Yes. 

388
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:45,795
No, no, no! You need to stay here. 

389
00:48:45,795 --> 00:48:46,875
Okay. 

390
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:49,606
I will bring your pappa here. Okay? 

391
00:48:49,715 --> 00:48:51,195
No! No, you have to stay here. 

392
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:53,275
You have to stay here 
because it's a very long way, 

393
00:48:53,275 --> 00:48:54,755
and you have to rest. Okay? 

394
00:48:54,755 --> 00:48:56,917
_ Okay. 
_ Okay. 

395
00:49:19,395 --> 00:49:20,995
BernstrÃ¶m! 

396
00:50:42,315 --> 00:50:43,915
Where's my mom? 

397
00:50:45,315 --> 00:50:46,915
Mom? 

398
00:50:49,315 --> 00:50:50,915
Mom! 

399
00:50:52,355 --> 00:50:53,955
Mom! 

400
00:50:56,835 --> 00:50:59,520
No. No! What are you doing? 

401
00:50:59,595 --> 00:51:03,361
No, this is my mom's bed! Get off! No! 

402
00:51:03,995 --> 00:51:06,760
- Get off! Get off! 
- It's all right. 

403
00:51:07,675 --> 00:51:09,195
It's okay. Take it easy, boy. 

404
00:51:09,195 --> 00:51:12,119
No! My mom was here, and she took her file. 

405
00:51:17,435 --> 00:51:20,518
Look, you have to come with me. 

406
00:51:20,595 --> 00:51:23,041
I will help you. Okay? 

407
00:51:24,355 --> 00:51:25,875
Okay? 

408
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,764
Okay. Okay. 

409
00:52:08,475 --> 00:52:10,125
What's your name? 

410
00:52:13,635 --> 00:52:15,239
What's your name? 

411
00:52:15,955 --> 00:52:17,555
Lucas Bennett. 

412
00:52:19,635 --> 00:52:21,603
Where were you staying? 

413
00:52:23,275 --> 00:52:26,563
In the, uh, the Orchid... 

414
00:52:26,635 --> 00:52:29,605
The Orchid Beach Resort in Khao Lak. 

415
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:32,755
Was somebody else traveling with you? 

416
00:52:34,955 --> 00:52:36,555
Lucas? 

417
00:52:38,035 --> 00:52:40,436
My dad and my two little brothers. 

418
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:46,276
Do you know what happened to them? 

419
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:52,395
Is there somebody we could call? 

420
00:52:52,395 --> 00:52:53,995
Um... 

421
00:52:55,995 --> 00:52:57,595
My granddad. 

422
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,195
What's his name? 

423
00:52:59,195 --> 00:53:03,564
Brian. But I don't remember his number. 

424
00:55:11,115 --> 00:55:12,715
Lucas? 

425
00:55:16,435 --> 00:55:18,035
Lucas! 

426
00:55:28,835 --> 00:55:30,435
Maria! 

427
00:55:31,715 --> 00:55:33,315
Maria! 

428
00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:36,635
Lucas! 

429
00:55:40,275 --> 00:55:41,875
Lucas! 

430
00:55:42,275 --> 00:55:43,879
Maria! 

431
00:55:47,715 --> 00:55:49,315
Lucas! 

432
00:55:53,115 --> 00:55:54,715
Maria! 

433
00:56:56,755 --> 00:56:58,875
<i>Hotel, we have 
prepared transport for you.</i>

434
00:56:58,875 --> 00:57:01,765
<i>We have to move to the Sangdee camp.</i>

435
00:57:02,595 --> 00:57:06,122
<i>Move, everyone, please. 
You can't just stay</i>here. 

436
00:57:24,715 --> 00:57:26,315
Hey, man! 

437
00:57:26,755 --> 00:57:28,075
You all right? 

438
00:57:28,075 --> 00:57:30,396
I just need to lie here a minute. 

439
00:57:31,395 --> 00:57:32,555
I'll be up in a second. 

440
00:57:32,555 --> 00:57:34,555
Don't even bother. They're sending trucks 

441
00:57:34,555 --> 00:57:36,075
to drive us all up to the mountains. 

442
00:57:36,075 --> 00:57:37,835
Just hang on tight, all right? 
They'll be here soon. 

443
00:57:37,835 --> 00:57:40,568
Yeah, I know. Can you tell them I'm back? 

444
00:57:41,155 --> 00:57:42,755
Yeah, sure. Hold on. 

445
00:57:49,235 --> 00:57:52,444
Hey, boys! Your daddy's back! 

446
00:57:52,515 --> 00:57:54,756
Dad! Dad! Dad! 

447
00:57:55,155 --> 00:57:56,755
Dad! Dad! 

448
00:57:57,755 --> 00:57:58,995
Hey. 

449
00:57:58,995 --> 00:58:00,915
Dad, a whole lot of helicopters just flew by! 

450
00:58:00,915 --> 00:58:02,758
_ Did they? 
_ Yeah. 

451
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:04,875
Mom and Lucas? 

452
00:58:06,095 --> 00:58:07,935
Why don't you come down here 
a minute, Thomas. 

453
00:58:07,935 --> 00:58:09,539
What about me? 

454
00:58:09,615 --> 00:58:10,775
You stay and see if you can see 

455
00:58:10,775 --> 00:58:12,455
any more helicopters. Okay? 

456
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:14,105
_ Okay. 
_ Good boy. 

457
00:58:17,295 --> 00:58:20,697
You're almost there, buddy. You got it? 

458
00:58:30,195 --> 00:58:32,277
I still haven't found them. 

459
00:58:33,395 --> 00:58:35,716
Did you see a lot of dead people? 

460
00:58:38,675 --> 00:58:41,035
What happened was very serious, Thomas. 

461
00:58:41,035 --> 00:58:43,242
Not Mom and Lucas, right? 

462
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:45,158
No, I didn't see them. 

463
00:58:46,795 --> 00:58:49,036
I burnt my feet on the roof. 

464
00:58:49,155 --> 00:58:52,125
It was really hot, and everyone was leaving. 

465
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,315
Oh. 

466
00:58:53,315 --> 00:58:54,915
Can we leave yet? 

467
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:00,285
I need you to, um... 

468
00:59:00,355 --> 00:59:02,881
I need you to do me a favor, Thomas. 

469
00:59:03,675 --> 00:59:05,475
I've heard that everyone's 
going to the mountains, you see, 

470
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:07,875
to a shelter where it's really safe. 

471
00:59:12,555 --> 00:59:13,915
But I can't go with you. 

472
00:59:13,915 --> 00:59:16,075
You can't leave us alone again, Dad. 

473
00:59:16,075 --> 00:59:18,155
I have to keep looking for them, you see. 

474
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:19,195
You have to look after Simon... 

475
00:59:19,195 --> 00:59:23,200
No! No, stay with us. I can't look... 

476
00:59:23,515 --> 00:59:27,076
I've never looked after 
someone before. I'm scared. 

477
00:59:27,195 --> 00:59:30,404
I know. I know. I'm scared, too. 

478
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:36,517
But do you know the most scary bit for me? 

479
00:59:39,235 --> 00:59:40,675
When the water hit? 

480
00:59:40,675 --> 00:59:42,518
No. After that. 

481
00:59:42,595 --> 00:59:45,883
When I came up, and I was all on my own. 

482
00:59:45,955 --> 00:59:48,083
That was the scariest part. 

483
00:59:48,195 --> 00:59:52,035
And then I saw the two of you 
clinging to the tree, and I... 

484
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:53,555
I didn't feel so scared anymore, 

485
00:59:53,555 --> 00:59:56,422
because I knew I wasn't 
on my own, you see? 

486
00:59:57,035 --> 01:00:00,395
What if Mommy and Lucas 
are on their own right now? 

487
01:00:00,395 --> 01:00:01,635
Hmm? 

488
01:00:01,635 --> 01:00:03,395
Imagine how scared they'll be. 

489
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:04,435
We'll look for them together. 

490
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:08,565
No. Thomas, you have to look after Simon. 

491
01:00:09,435 --> 01:00:12,086
And I'm going to keep looking for them. 

492
01:00:13,435 --> 01:00:15,035
Okay? 

493
01:00:16,995 --> 01:00:18,595
Okay? 

494
01:00:20,475 --> 01:00:22,075
I know you understand. 

495
01:00:25,315 --> 01:00:28,285
<i>Everyone move out. 
You can't stand here.</i>

496
01:00:29,235 --> 01:00:32,568
<i>There might be another wave 
coming soon. Move out.</i>

497
01:00:49,515 --> 01:00:52,166
Hello? Yeah, I can hear you. 

498
01:00:53,795 --> 01:00:55,728
Nobody knows what's going on. 

499
01:00:56,275 --> 01:00:58,115
Are you all right? Have you lost someone? 

500
01:00:58,115 --> 01:01:00,115
We're fine. We just want to get out of here. 

501
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:02,356
I'll call you back. Okay? Bye. 

502
01:01:03,435 --> 01:01:05,039
Uh, excuse me. 

503
01:01:05,115 --> 01:01:06,715
I've been trying to place 
a call back home all day. 

504
01:01:06,715 --> 01:01:07,795
I wondered, could I use your phone? 

505
01:01:07,795 --> 01:01:09,475
_ It would Be really quick. 
_ Look around You, man. 

506
01:01:09,475 --> 01:01:10,995
Everybody's needing something right now. 

507
01:01:10,995 --> 01:01:12,115
But our battery is almost dead. 

508
01:01:12,115 --> 01:01:13,715
We need the phone. 

509
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:14,795
Yes, as I said, 

510
01:01:14,795 --> 01:01:16,795
we are trying to clear the road, but... 

511
01:01:16,795 --> 01:01:17,955
I understand, but I'd like to talk 

512
01:01:17,955 --> 01:01:21,288
to somebody in charge 
who knows a little bit more. 

513
01:01:30,435 --> 01:01:32,275
I'll see you in the morning, okay? 

514
01:01:32,275 --> 01:01:33,925
You're not coming? 

515
01:01:34,155 --> 01:01:36,022
I'm not coming, wee man, no. 

516
01:01:36,035 --> 01:01:38,702
Thomas will take care of you, all right? 

517
01:01:39,035 --> 01:01:42,435
Listen to me. You're gonna 
behave yourselves, okay? 

518
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:44,675
And you stay with this group, 

519
01:01:44,675 --> 01:01:48,275
and I'm gonna be with you 
just as soon as I can, okay? 

520
01:01:48,835 --> 01:01:51,302
You're gonna behave yourselves, okay? 

521
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:54,475
I love you. 

522
01:01:55,275 --> 01:01:56,875
Okay. 

523
01:01:58,035 --> 01:01:59,835
Will you look out for my boys 
for me, please? 

524
01:01:59,835 --> 01:02:01,355
Come with us. 

525
01:02:01,355 --> 01:02:02,955
You know it's useless. 

526
01:02:04,315 --> 01:02:05,915
I can't stop looking. 

527
01:02:09,195 --> 01:02:10,845
_ I love you. 

528
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:13,662
I'll be with you tomorrow, I promise. 

529
01:02:13,835 --> 01:02:15,435
I love you. 

530
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,435
Maria! 

531
01:02:39,595 --> 01:02:41,195
Lucas! 

532
01:02:51,035 --> 01:02:52,635
Maria! 

533
01:03:06,275 --> 01:03:07,875
- Oh! 

534
01:03:15,235 --> 01:03:16,835
Oh, no. No. 

535
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:35,563
Hey, man, are you okay? 

536
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:38,955
Get in the car. 

537
01:03:38,955 --> 01:03:41,088
We'll drive you somewhere safer. 

538
01:03:46,635 --> 01:03:48,955
My wife didn't want 
to come to Thailand 

539
01:03:48,955 --> 01:03:50,764
for Christmas holidays, 

540
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:54,279
because of my leg. 

541
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:01,325
I insisted. My little girl, Gina, 

542
01:04:04,755 --> 01:04:06,355
she's just two. 

543
01:04:07,115 --> 01:04:08,715
The noise woke me up. 

544
01:04:09,435 --> 01:04:11,358
I was alone in the room. 

545
01:04:13,315 --> 01:04:17,048
I went out to the terrace 
and saw the sea coming inland. 

546
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:21,195
It took me five seconds to reach the stairs, 

547
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:23,328
but the water was already there. 

548
01:04:23,995 --> 01:04:26,262
It was not more than five seconds. 

549
01:04:27,035 --> 01:04:30,835
On the bed, 
I found a note from my wife, 

550
01:04:31,675 --> 01:04:34,008
saying that they were at the beach. 

551
01:04:39,635 --> 01:04:41,842
You were at the Orchid, right? 

552
01:04:41,955 --> 01:04:43,555
Yeah. 

553
01:04:46,995 --> 01:04:48,355
Yeah, my whole family were in 

554
01:04:48,355 --> 01:04:51,006
the swimming pool when the water hit. 

555
01:04:52,995 --> 01:04:54,875
I found my middle son first, 
Thomas. He was... 

556
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:57,742
He was at the top of this really tall tree. 

557
01:04:58,475 --> 01:05:00,195
Took me ages 
to convince him to come down 

558
01:05:00,195 --> 01:05:02,596
because he was so scared, you know? 

559
01:05:02,675 --> 01:05:04,875
And then I found my little one, Simon. 

560
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:07,481
He was holding onto a palm tree. 

561
01:05:08,795 --> 01:05:10,395
He's only five. 

562
01:05:14,195 --> 01:05:16,562
I sent them to the mountains. 

563
01:05:17,755 --> 01:05:19,355
You know? 

564
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:23,742
So that I could keep looking 
for my wife and my elder son. 

565
01:05:27,075 --> 01:05:29,203
Toughest choice I ever made. 

566
01:05:29,715 --> 01:05:33,115
_ have You called home yet? 
- I can't find a phone. 

567
01:05:39,355 --> 01:05:43,121
I'm saving my battery. 
Just in case my family calls. 

568
01:05:44,715 --> 01:05:46,315
Please. 

569
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:49,968
Thank you. I'll be very quick, I promise. 

570
01:06:01,355 --> 01:06:02,915
<i>- Yes?</i>
_ Brian? 

571
01:06:02,915 --> 01:06:05,646
<i>Yes, Henry, thank God. How are you guys?</i>

572
01:06:06,275 --> 01:06:07,875
Did you hear from anyone yet? 

573
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:09,875
<i>No, Henry, you're the first to call.</i>

574
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:11,604
<i>Is everybody all right?</i>

575
01:06:12,955 --> 01:06:15,435
<i>- Henry?</i>
_ Maria And Lucas are not Here. 

576
01:06:15,435 --> 01:06:17,722
<i>What do you mean, "not there"?</i>

577
01:06:18,755 --> 01:06:21,918
The water came and swept everyone away. 

578
01:06:22,155 --> 01:06:24,635
And I found... I found Thomas and Simon, 

579
01:06:24,635 --> 01:06:26,635
but I don't know where Maria and Lucas are. 

580
01:06:26,635 --> 01:06:28,763
<i>Henry? Don't do that.</i>

581
01:06:29,475 --> 01:06:30,715
And I don't know what to do, 

582
01:06:30,715 --> 01:06:33,115
I don't know where to look for them. 

583
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:37,444
<i>Henry. Henry, calm down. 
Henry? Henry?</i>

584
01:06:37,555 --> 01:06:38,955
Brian, I have to go. 

585
01:06:38,955 --> 01:06:41,635
Lots of people 
need to use this phone, okay? 

586
01:06:41,635 --> 01:06:44,035
- I'll just call you later. 
_ Henry? 

587
01:06:59,795 --> 01:07:01,797
Sorry. I'm sorry, sorry. 

588
01:07:04,155 --> 01:07:05,755
Thank you. 

589
01:07:18,795 --> 01:07:20,195
What do you want me to do? 

590
01:07:20,195 --> 01:07:23,278
You can't leave it like that. Go on! 

591
01:07:24,835 --> 01:07:26,439
- Come on! 
_ go on. 

592
01:07:29,155 --> 01:07:31,317
_ Come on, man. 
_ Come on. 

593
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:36,475
I should call him back. 

594
01:07:43,555 --> 01:07:45,355
<i>- Yes, Henry?</i>
- Brian, it's me again. 

595
01:07:45,355 --> 01:07:47,995
Look, I promise you 
that I won't stop looking 

596
01:07:47,995 --> 01:07:49,515
_ until I find them. okay? 
<i>- Okay.</i>

597
01:07:49,515 --> 01:07:50,675
I don't know what I'm gonna do 

598
01:07:50,675 --> 01:07:52,555
because it's nighttime now, but I'll... 

599
01:07:52,555 --> 01:07:54,035
I'll look in all the hospitals. 

600
01:07:54,035 --> 01:07:55,155
<i>- Okay.</i>
- And I'll look 

601
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:56,475
in all the shelters and everything, okay? 

602
01:07:56,475 --> 01:07:58,195
I will find them, I promise you that. 

603
01:07:58,195 --> 01:07:59,915
- I'll call you when I do. 
<i>- Okay.</i>

604
01:07:59,915 --> 01:08:01,644
_ Okay. Okay. 
<i>- Okay.</i>

605
01:08:04,155 --> 01:08:05,755
Thanks. 

606
01:08:10,915 --> 01:08:12,599
Can I go with you? 

607
01:08:28,355 --> 01:08:29,755
I'm scared. 

608
01:08:29,755 --> 01:08:32,679
Close your eyes. Think of something nice. 

609
01:08:43,955 --> 01:08:45,555
May I sit with you? 

610
01:09:03,035 --> 01:09:04,635
How old are you? 

611
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:09,719
Almost 74. And you? 

612
01:09:10,595 --> 01:09:12,195
Seven and a half. 

613
01:09:13,595 --> 01:09:15,438
Get these ants off me. 

614
01:09:17,555 --> 01:09:20,888
_ is he all right? 
- Yeah, he's asleep. He's fine. 

615
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,915
He's got a bit of ant bites on him. 

616
01:09:22,915 --> 01:09:24,515
He's all right. 

617
01:09:29,955 --> 01:09:32,481
You like looking at stars, don't you? 

618
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:36,102
I do. At home I can find 
most of the constellations. 

619
01:09:37,075 --> 01:09:39,646
But here in the sky, it's different. 

620
01:09:41,995 --> 01:09:43,838
Some of those stars 

621
01:09:45,315 --> 01:09:48,125
have been burnt out for a long, long time. 

622
01:09:49,475 --> 01:09:51,159
Did you know that? 

623
01:09:52,675 --> 01:09:54,757
They're dead, aren't they? 

624
01:09:58,795 --> 01:10:00,395
They're dead. 

625
01:10:01,635 --> 01:10:03,558
But once they were so bright 

626
01:10:03,635 --> 01:10:06,968
that their light is still 
traveling through space. 

627
01:10:07,315 --> 01:10:09,158
We can still see them. 

628
01:10:10,635 --> 01:10:12,275
How can you tell which ones are dead 

629
01:10:12,275 --> 01:10:13,875
and which ones are not? 

630
01:10:13,955 --> 01:10:16,196
Oh, you can't. It's impossible. 

631
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:23,968
It's a beautiful mystery, isn't it? 

632
01:10:24,395 --> 01:10:25,995
Mmm. 

633
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:52,879
Lucas Bennett? 
Can you come with me? 

634
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:03,275
Sit here. 

635
01:11:20,195 --> 01:11:22,995
Your name is Lucas Bennett, is that right? 

636
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:24,955
Yeah. 

637
01:11:24,955 --> 01:11:27,235
And your mother's name is Maria Bennett. 

638
01:11:27,235 --> 01:11:29,397
_ is that correct? 
_ Uh-huh. 

639
01:11:30,195 --> 01:11:32,555
We'd like you to look at these things, please, 

640
01:11:32,555 --> 01:11:35,022
and see if you recognize any of them. 

641
01:11:36,235 --> 01:11:37,885
Have a good look. 

642
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:42,475
Take your time. 

643
01:11:59,275 --> 01:12:01,437
Does anything look familiar? 

644
01:12:02,595 --> 01:12:04,115
I don't know. 

645
01:12:04,115 --> 01:12:05,715
You don't know? 

646
01:12:11,795 --> 01:12:13,395
I... 

647
01:12:14,795 --> 01:12:16,638
Do you recognize anything? 

648
01:12:17,115 --> 01:12:19,848
- I don't think so. 
- You don't think so? 

649
01:12:23,835 --> 01:12:25,435
Lucas... 

650
01:12:29,795 --> 01:12:31,795
Could you please come with us? 

651
01:12:48,355 --> 01:12:49,955
Mom. 

652
01:12:55,835 --> 01:12:57,997
Where the hell have you been? 

653
01:12:58,515 --> 01:13:00,677
Where the hell have I been? 

654
01:13:01,675 --> 01:13:03,564
Where the hell were you? 

655
01:13:04,035 --> 01:13:06,035
You promised me 
you weren't going anywhere. 

656
01:13:06,035 --> 01:13:08,037
You weren't there. 

657
01:13:10,995 --> 01:13:13,202
I thought you were dead, Mom. 

658
01:13:15,635 --> 01:13:17,235
I'm sorry. 

659
01:13:18,515 --> 01:13:20,517
I thought you were dead. 

660
01:13:28,035 --> 01:13:29,639
We're so sorry. 

661
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:36,608
Someone must have changed 
her records during surgery. 

662
01:13:36,635 --> 01:13:38,235
How is she? 

663
01:13:40,595 --> 01:13:43,201
She's had surgery on her chest. 

664
01:13:43,395 --> 01:13:45,762
But she lost a lot of blood. 

665
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:49,879
She was too weak 
to have her leg operated on. 

666
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:54,075
She has to go back to surgery 
when she recovers. 

667
01:13:54,515 --> 01:13:56,563
But she'll be okay, right? 

668
01:15:06,675 --> 01:15:08,404
Nothing. What next? 

669
01:15:09,275 --> 01:15:10,835
We should, uh... 

670
01:15:10,835 --> 01:15:14,102
We should try and get a ride 
to Takuapa Hospital. 

671
01:15:37,835 --> 01:15:40,195
_ Where are my kids? 
- They're taking them away. 

672
01:15:40,195 --> 01:15:41,795
They wouldn't let me go 
with them. I'm sorry. 

673
01:15:41,795 --> 01:15:43,479
_ Where? 
- I don't know. 

674
01:16:03,515 --> 01:16:05,199
I need to pee. 

675
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:07,477
You have to wait, Simon. 

676
01:17:40,275 --> 01:17:42,277
Mom. Mom. 

677
01:17:42,715 --> 01:17:44,315
_ Lucas... 
_ Wake up. 

678
01:17:44,435 --> 01:17:46,881
Mom, guess who I just saw outside? 

679
01:17:47,275 --> 01:17:50,040
My leg. What color is my leg? 

680
01:18:04,075 --> 01:18:05,675
It's still red. 

681
01:18:26,795 --> 01:18:28,395
Please. My mom. 

682
01:18:28,395 --> 01:18:30,796
Her wounds are looking really bad. 

683
01:18:32,995 --> 01:18:35,236
We are doing the best we can. 

684
01:18:35,315 --> 01:18:38,315
We are taking your mom 
to surgery right away. 

685
01:18:55,315 --> 01:18:57,195
No more sick here since yesterday. 

686
01:18:57,195 --> 01:18:58,475
It's full. We move out. 

687
01:18:58,475 --> 01:19:00,515
No, no, no! Five minutes. 
Give me five minutes, please. 

688
01:19:00,515 --> 01:19:02,115
Please. 

689
01:19:03,355 --> 01:19:05,355
I don't want you to slow down. 

690
01:19:06,595 --> 01:19:09,035
These are the names of my 
little girl, Gina, and Kathy, 

691
01:19:09,035 --> 01:19:11,197
my wife. She's American. 

692
01:19:11,315 --> 01:19:12,355
Would you check the list for me? 

693
01:19:12,355 --> 01:19:14,039
_ of course. 
_ Please. 

694
01:19:14,115 --> 01:19:17,195
They told us our daughter 
could be in Surat Thani. 

695
01:19:17,195 --> 01:19:19,555
And we've already been to this hospital. 

696
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:23,640
We have checked all hospitals 
but this one. Please. 

697
01:19:23,715 --> 01:19:25,715
Five minutes, please. 
Just only five minutes. 

698
01:19:25,715 --> 01:19:26,795
Okay. 

699
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:29,321
I won't be long. I'll be right back. 

700
01:19:45,355 --> 01:19:46,955
Lucas. 

701
01:19:48,395 --> 01:19:49,995
Lucas. 

702
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:54,761
Anything left in the can? 

703
01:20:00,715 --> 01:20:03,366
Don't worry. I'll get you something. 

704
01:22:21,155 --> 01:22:22,755
Dad? 

705
01:22:24,035 --> 01:22:25,635

706
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:28,675
Dad! 

707

Dad! 

708
01:22:37,075 --> 01:22:38,675
Dad! 

709
01:23:08,435 --> 01:23:09,755
I need to pee! 

710
01:23:09,755 --> 01:23:11,962
_ can You hold it? 
_ No. 

711
01:23:15,355 --> 01:23:17,088
Simon! What are you doing? 

712
01:23:22,115 --> 01:23:25,119
Boys! Get back 
on the bus right now! 

713
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:27,635
Hurry up! They're gonna leave us here! 

714
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:29,603
What are you doing? 

715
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:55,315
No luck. 

716
01:23:55,315 --> 01:23:56,915
Sorry. 

717
01:24:01,275 --> 01:24:03,801
Sorry. And thanks for waiting. 

718
01:24:05,075 --> 01:24:06,675
Okay. We go now. 

719
01:24:38,315 --> 01:24:39,915
Coming! 

720
01:24:40,955 --> 01:24:43,720
- We're coming! 
- We have to go now! 

721
01:24:49,115 --> 01:24:51,004
Dad! 

722
01:24:52,155 --> 01:24:53,755
It's Lucas. 

723
01:24:54,795 --> 01:24:59,795
- Lucas! 
- Lucas! 

724
01:25:06,675 --> 01:25:08,962
Simon! Thomas! 

725
01:25:09,715 --> 01:25:11,638
Lucas! Lucas! 

726
01:25:11,875 --> 01:25:13,035
Lucas! 

727
01:25:13,035 --> 01:25:14,475
Thomas! Simon! 

728
01:25:14,475 --> 01:25:16,716
Lucas! Lucas! 

729
01:25:17,235 --> 01:25:24,005
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! 

730
01:25:24,075 --> 01:25:25,675
- Lucas! 
- Simon! 

731
01:25:26,795 --> 01:25:28,238
Searched everywhere... 

732
01:25:42,515 --> 01:25:44,115
Simon. 

733
01:25:44,595 --> 01:25:46,195
Thomas. 

734
01:25:47,895 --> 01:25:49,005
Are you okay? 

735
01:25:59,615 --> 01:26:01,215
Lucas! 

736
01:26:03,615 --> 01:26:05,379
Dad! Dad... 

737
01:26:05,455 --> 01:26:07,264
Dad. Dad? 

738
01:26:09,015 --> 01:26:10,615
Lucas! 

739
01:26:11,335 --> 01:26:12,775
Lucas! 

740
01:26:12,775 --> 01:26:14,375
- Dad! 
- Lucas! 

741
01:26:16,135 --> 01:26:17,735
Dad! 

742
01:26:18,735 --> 01:26:21,625
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! 

743
01:26:22,535 --> 01:26:25,300
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! 

744
01:26:26,535 --> 01:26:28,458
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 

745
01:26:29,415 --> 01:26:30,535
I'm sorry I left you both. 

746
01:26:30,535 --> 01:26:32,135
Dad, we did it. 

747
01:26:36,095 --> 01:26:38,621
Let's go. No need to wait. 

748
01:26:49,975 --> 01:26:51,298
Are you okay? Are you okay? 

749
01:26:54,895 --> 01:26:56,823
_ Mom is Here. 
_ What? 

750
01:26:57,655 --> 01:27:01,626
She's really weak. She says 
some weird stuff sometimes. 

751
01:27:02,655 --> 01:27:03,735
The nurse says they're gonna 
try and operate on her 

752
01:27:03,735 --> 01:27:05,175
as soon as they can. 

753
01:27:05,175 --> 01:27:06,775
I think it's serious. 

754
01:27:07,975 --> 01:27:10,182
Mom? Mom. 

755
01:27:11,695 --> 01:27:13,295
Look who's here. 

756
01:27:20,975 --> 01:27:22,575
Hey. 

757
01:27:24,255 --> 01:27:25,855
Hey, my darling. 

758
01:27:26,495 --> 01:27:28,095
Hey. 

759
01:27:34,495 --> 01:27:36,095
Mom. 

760
01:27:38,375 --> 01:27:40,242
I thought you were all dead. 

761
01:27:40,335 --> 01:27:42,178
We're all okay. 

762
01:27:50,055 --> 01:27:51,175
Am I dead? 

763
01:27:51,175 --> 01:27:52,775
No. 

764
01:27:53,455 --> 01:27:55,055
No. 

765
01:28:00,215 --> 01:28:02,343
It's okay to take this off? 

766
01:28:03,055 --> 01:28:05,055
Here, here, here. I've got it. 

767
01:28:18,055 --> 01:28:20,183
_ You came back. 
_ Yes. 

768
01:28:21,935 --> 01:28:24,336
_ You came back. 
_ Yeah. 

769
01:28:26,415 --> 01:28:28,015
Oh, thank God. 

770
01:28:28,215 --> 01:28:29,865
I can rest now. 

771
01:28:36,775 --> 01:28:40,780
Maria, what? What? What, darling? 

772
01:28:42,095 --> 01:28:43,455
I'm dying. 

773
01:28:43,455 --> 01:28:45,105
No. No. 

774
01:28:46,615 --> 01:28:48,583
You're going to be fine. 

775
01:28:49,615 --> 01:28:51,617
Take care of our babies. 

776
01:28:52,415 --> 01:28:54,941
Hey, that's not what I came here for. 

777
01:28:55,575 --> 01:28:56,615
You're gonna be fine. 

778
01:28:56,615 --> 01:28:58,775
They're gonna take good care of you, okay? 

779
01:28:58,775 --> 01:29:01,221
I promise you, we're gonna be fine. 

780
01:29:01,695 --> 01:29:04,221
Oh, Henry, I'm scared. 

781
01:29:04,295 --> 01:29:06,059
We're gonna be fine. 

782
01:29:06,615 --> 01:29:08,299
Henry... 

783
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:11,265
Sweetheart, I promise you're gonna be okay. 

784
01:29:11,615 --> 01:29:15,148
We're taking her to surgery. 
We need to take her now. 

785
01:29:15,935 --> 01:29:17,535
Okay. 

786
01:29:21,895 --> 01:29:23,495
I love you. 

787
01:29:24,295 --> 01:29:26,104
You're gonna be okay. 

788
01:29:26,455 --> 01:29:29,504
I love you so much. I love you. 

789
01:29:32,135 --> 01:29:35,617
I love you, Maria. You know that, don't you? 

790
01:29:37,175 --> 01:29:39,781
I'm sorry if I let you down in any way. 

791
01:30:28,695 --> 01:30:30,299
Lucas. 

792
01:30:31,535 --> 01:30:33,822
Thanks for taking care of Mom. 

793
01:30:35,455 --> 01:30:37,537
We took care of each other. 

794
01:30:44,215 --> 01:30:45,575
<i>Dad?</i>

795
01:30:45,575 --> 01:30:47,175
<i>Yeah.</i>

796
01:30:48,015 --> 01:30:50,495
<i>There's something I didn't tell Mom.</i>

797
01:30:50,575 --> 01:30:53,419
<i>And I really need her to know.</i>

798
01:31:20,015 --> 01:31:22,063
I have a family, too. 

799
01:31:25,775 --> 01:31:27,937
I've been saving my strength 

800
01:31:29,255 --> 01:31:31,257
because I want to see them 

801
01:31:32,775 --> 01:31:34,375
one more time. 

802
01:32:27,175 --> 01:32:28,779
Oh. Do you have to? 

803
01:32:30,015 --> 01:32:32,416
We don't want you to feel any pain. 

804
01:32:32,495 --> 01:32:34,015
I'm afraid to go to sleep. 

805
01:32:34,015 --> 01:32:36,859
Shh. You're in good hands. 

806
01:32:38,855 --> 01:32:41,788
Close your eyes 
and think of something nice. 

807
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,943
Think of something nice. 

808
01:33:19,655 --> 01:33:20,895
Lucas! 

809
01:33:20,895 --> 01:33:22,495
Dad! 

810
01:36:13,215 --> 01:36:14,815
Mom's okay, Lucas. 

811
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:19,505
We're going home. 

812
01:36:32,055 --> 01:36:34,057
Be careful. You okay? 

813
01:36:34,215 --> 01:36:35,882
Mr. Bennett! Mr. Bennett! 

814
01:36:36,095 --> 01:36:38,095
I'm Oliver Tudpole from Zurich Insurance. 

815
01:36:38,095 --> 01:36:39,495
They sent me to take care of your family. 

816
01:36:39,495 --> 01:36:41,735
You have nothing to worry about now. 

817
01:36:41,735 --> 01:36:44,055
In a few hours, you'll be at 
Singapore General Hospital, 

818
01:36:44,055 --> 01:36:45,415
where your wife will receive 

819
01:36:45,415 --> 01:36:47,682
the best treatment in all of Asia. 

820
01:36:48,375 --> 01:36:49,495
These people will take you onto the plane. 

821
01:36:49,495 --> 01:36:51,175
I'll see you once you get there. 

822
01:36:51,175 --> 01:36:52,775
Have a safe flight. 

823
01:37:30,655 --> 01:37:32,255
Okay. 

824
01:37:35,655 --> 01:37:37,255
Where are we going? 

825
01:37:39,895 --> 01:37:43,695
They'll take us to Singapore. 
You'll be safe there, okay? 

826
01:37:48,055 --> 01:37:51,335
Please take your seat. 
We'll be taking off shortly. 

827
01:37:51,335 --> 01:37:52,935
Okay. 

828
01:38:13,175 --> 01:38:15,908
_ can I just... 
_ Yeah. Okay. one minute. 

829
01:38:16,975 --> 01:38:18,575
Hey. 

830
01:38:30,695 --> 01:38:32,295
How are you? 

831
01:38:34,175 --> 01:38:36,382
Here. With you. 

832
01:38:41,455 --> 01:38:43,055
Mom. 

833
01:38:44,775 --> 01:38:46,375
Guess what? 

834
01:38:49,015 --> 01:38:50,615
I saw Daniel again. 

835
01:38:53,535 --> 01:38:55,185
He was so happy. 

836
01:38:58,895 --> 01:39:00,977
He was in somebody's arms. 

837
01:39:04,015 --> 01:39:05,748
I bet it was his dad, Mom. 

838
01:39:14,175 --> 01:39:15,775
I love you. 

839
01:39:19,855 --> 01:39:23,098
Lucas, I love you so much. 

840
01:39:31,255 --> 01:39:34,418
Thank you. Thank you. 

841
01:39:37,375 --> 01:39:41,061
I'm sorry, but you have 
to go back to your seat now. 

842
01:39:49,255 --> 01:39:51,255
Fasten your seatbelts, please. 

843
01:39:52,775 --> 01:39:54,375
I don't want to. 

844
01:39:54,535 --> 01:39:58,381
Why not? You have to do 
your seatbelts up in a plane. 

845
01:40:52,815 --> 01:40:55,102
It's okay. It's only the plane.
