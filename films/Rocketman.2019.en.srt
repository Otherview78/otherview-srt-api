1
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,528
How long is this gonna take?

2
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,277
That's really up to you.

3
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:43,904
Right, then.

4
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,824
I know how this bit goes.

5
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,378
My name is Elton Hercules John...

6
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,224
and I'm an alcoholic.

7
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,684
And a cocaine addict.

8
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,403
And a sex addict.

9
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,068
And a bulimic.

10
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,404
I'm also a shopaholic,
who has problems with weed...

11
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,031
prescription drugs...

12
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,001
and anger management.

13
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,417
Why are you here now?

14
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,085
Well, my dealer was out of town.

15
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,975
I thought this seemed like
a good alternative.

16
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,135
I'm here because I want to get better.

17
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,933
What were you like as a child, Elton?

18
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,264
As a child?

19
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,740
<i>I was justified when I was five</i>

20
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,293
<i>Raising Cain
I'll spit in your eye</i>

21
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,467
<i>Times are changing
Now the poor get fat</i>

22
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:26,473
<i>But the fever's gonna catch you
When the bitch gets back</i>

23
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,062
<i>Eat meat on a Friday</i>

24
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,810
<i>- That's all right
- That's all right</i>

25
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,938
<i>- Even like steak on a Saturday night
- Saturday night</i>

26
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,612
<i>- I can bitch the best at your social dos
- Social dos</i>

27
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,941
<i>I get high in the evening
Sniffing pots of glue</i>

28
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,129
<i>I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch
Oh, the bitch is back!</i>

29
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,462
<i>Stone-cold sober
As a matter of fact</i>

30
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,299
<i>I can bitch, I can bitch
'Cause I'm better than you</i>

31
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,305
<i>It's the way that I move
The things that I do</i>

32
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,464
Reggie! You're late!

33
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,168
I've had to throw your dinner
in the bin! Get inside.

34
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:56,939
Is he back?

35
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
What am I? Thin air?

36
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,688
Wouldn't get your hopes up.

37
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,236
He's very unreliable and very selfish.

38
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,314
But will you send him up
if I'm already in bed?

39
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,740
Reggie! Move!

40
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,984
Got to get this done
before I go out.

41
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,039
All right, all done.

42
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,787
Put it away before you go out.

43
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,709
Mum, I've got to go.

44
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,586
Where's my cardigan?

45
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,446
What? Did I do something wrong?

46
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,863
Bloody hell, Sheila.

47
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,941
Maybe we should get him some lessons.

48
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,453
Love to.
Get him out from under my feet.

49
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,574
Go on, play it again.

50
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,669
I want to play it for Dad.

51
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,799
Managed to drag yourself home then.

52
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,256
- Hello, Stanley.
- How are you, Ivy?

53
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,557
Like you care.

54
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,350
Come on.
You're letting in a draft.

55
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,182
How long you back?

56
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,891
I've got a couple of weeks leave.

57
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,394
Reggie's not long gone to bed.

58
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,821
Go on. Pop up, say hello.

59
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,824
I'll see him tomorrow.

60
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,610
Any dinner left?

61
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,696
Or have you fed it all to that boy?

62
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,666
My dad was passionate about...

63
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,753
family and music.

64
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,956
He'd talk for hours about jazz.

65
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,209
He was always hugging me.

66
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,302
I was very lucky.

67
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,596
I was actually a very happy child.

68
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,732
Dad, is it true you play piano?

69
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,525
I'm saving to get lessons.

70
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,823
If you want to sit in here,
you'll have to be quiet.

71
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,614
I'm listening to my music.

72
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,579
I like this one, Dad.

73
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,384
Never, ever touch
my collection without asking.

74
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,938
When are you going to hug me?

75
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,064
Don't be soft.

76
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,029
What are you still doing up?

77
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,457
Learning.

78
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,245
Turn off the light. Go to sleep.

79
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,805
Crumbs! That was energetic!

80
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,101
Play another one.

81
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,855
The "Moonlight Sonata," Reggie.

82
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,148
Mum? My piano teacher
thinks I'm good enough

83
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,404
for a scholarship
at the Royal Academy of Music.

84
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,116
The Royal Academy of Music?

85
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,081
It has a nice ring to it.

86
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:27,501
"Royal."

87
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,163
Scissors.

88
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,544
- What do you think?
- The red one's good.

89
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,420
- It's only on Saturdays.
- I've things to do on weekends.

90
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,506
- Can't just drop everything.
- I'll take you.

91
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,311
- Where are you off to?
- Don't know.

92
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,478
Haven't decided yet.

93
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,103
But whatever it is, you're not invited.

94
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,486
Reggie's piano teacher thinks
he's good enough for a scholarship.

95
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,030
Really?

96
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,398
You think he's got that kind of talent?

97
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,859
Of course, he has.
But you'd know that

98
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,616
if you took the slightest bit of
interest in me or this family.

99
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,250
Stop looking at that.
You're not a girl.

100
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,566
- Can we go home?
- Home? No going home.

101
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,893
This is your life.

102
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,483
You have to get over
that silly shyness.

103
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,072
But Mum says I'll never...

104
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,275
Everybody's frightened
at the beginning.

105
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,485
You play at being confident.

106
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,662
Life gives you
very few chances, Reggie,

107
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,160
and this is one of yours.

108
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,262
You show 'em you can be
as good as they are.

109
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,578
Better. Number one.
You can do that, can't you?

110
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,460
- Yeah, I suppose.
- Good. Go on then. Here.

111
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,258
Here's for a bag of chips
and your bus fare home.

112
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,860
Reginald Dwight?

113
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,439
- Yes.
- Hi. How do you do?

114
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,409
Good, thank you.

115
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,448
Take your coat off.

116
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,366
Did you not bring something to play?

117
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,254
Didn't know I had to.

118
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:37,965
I see. Well...

119
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,967
So, can you show me anything

120
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,841
so I can get a sense
of where you're up to?

121
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,401
Why have you stopped?

122
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,121
That's as far as you got.

123
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,664
You might have a good memory,
and a good ear,

124
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,746
but you've an awful lot
of work to do.

125
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,291
So, wrists and back straight.

126
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,211
Let's start with the C-major scale,

127
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,217
both hands, two octaves.

128
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,852
Hands off the table, Reginald.
Stop making that noise.

129
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,686
What you looking at me for?

130
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,378
<i>I want love</i>

131
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,551
<i>But it's impossible</i>

132
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,718
<i>A man like him</i>

133
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,300
<i>So irresponsible</i>

134
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,888
<i>A man like him</i>

135
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,600
<i>Is dead in places</i>

136
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:27,110
<i>Other men feel liberated</i>

137
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,862
<i>I can't love</i>

138
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,160
<i>Shot full of holes</i>

139
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,494
<i>Don't feel nothing</i>

140
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,164
<i>I just feel cold</i>

141
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,002
<i>Don't feel nothing</i>

142
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,210
<i>Just old scars</i>

143
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,465
<i>Toughening up</i>

144
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,515
<i>Around my heart</i>

145
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,393
<i>I want love</i>

146
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,063
<i>On my own terms</i>

147
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:06,604
<i>After everything I have learned</i>

148
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:13,615
<i>Me, I carry too much baggage</i>

149
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,697
<i>Oh, God, I've seen</i>

150
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,375
<i>So much traffic</i>

151
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,704
<i>But I want love</i>

152
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,548
<i>Just a different kind</i>

153
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,381
<i>- I want love
- Won't break me down</i>

154
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,589
<i>Won't brick me up
Won't fence me in</i>

155
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,926
<i>I want a love
That'll mean something</i>

156
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,726
<i>That's the love I want</i>

157
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:46,145
<i>I want love</i>

158
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,170
Boy... There's a boy there.

159
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,507
Reggie. What you doing?

160
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,646
Hello, son. I'm Fred.
I'm a friend of your mum's.

161
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,324
You tied me down
with that kid years ago,

162
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,948
and now I've finally
got a reason to leave

163
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:40,031
and be rid of you
and this bloody house!

164
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,389
He didn't even
give me a hug goodbye.

165
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,313
He's no good at showing affection.

166
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,315
Never has been.

167
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,193
- I wish I was someone else.
- Oh, don't be silly.

168
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,416
Well, how do you think I felt?

169
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,708
I was a kid.

170
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,377
Heartbroken.

171
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,390
People don't care though, do they?

172
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,605
Anyway...

173
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,270
I'd discovered records.

174
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,778
And rock 'n' roll.

175
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,534
I know you like him.
He's quite a dish.

176
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,082
- I would.
- Oh, Mum!

177
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,040
Thanks, Mum. It's fantastic.

178
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,963
You serious about wanting
to be a rock 'n' roller?

179
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,961
Yeah. Of course.

180
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,838
Better get you the proper haircut, eh?

181
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,884
- Can I get it cut like Elvis?
- Enjoy it while it lasts.

182
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,674
He's like my side of the family.

183
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,259
He'll be bald as an egg
by the time he's 20.

184
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,494
Congratulations to Dave.
He's won four pork chops,

185
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,167
half a pound of prime mince
and a string of sausages.

186
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,586
Thank you all! Thank you!

187
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,005
Now, Sheila and Fred's boy

188
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,299
is gonna sing us
a couple of songs on the piano.

189
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,967
Reggie Dwight!

190
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,510
Come on, Reg!

191
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,139
Go on, boy.

192
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,594
Hello.

193
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,677
Bloody hell. Have you got a fag?

194
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,691
Rubbish!

195
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,482
Reg, Reg, play the one I like.

196
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,195
Excuse me.

197
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,565
- You can't put that there.
- Why not?

198
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,117
It'll get knocked off.

199
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,240
<i>It's getting late
Have you seen my mates?</i>

200
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,825
<i>Ma, tell me when the boys get here</i>

201
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,287
<i>It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock</i>

202
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,089
<i>Wanna get a belly full of beer</i>

203
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,002
<i>My old man's drunker
Than a barrel full of monkeys</i>

204
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,588
<i>And my old lady
She don't care</i>

205
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,634
<i>My sister looks cute
In her braces and boots</i>

206
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,094
<i>A handful of grease in her hair</i>

207
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,314
<i>Don't give us none of your aggravation</i>

208
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,566
<i>We've had it with your discipline</i>

209
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,525
<i>'Cause Saturday night's
Alright for fighting</i>

210
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,031
<i>Get a little action in</i>

211
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,618
<i>Get about as oiled as a diesel train</i>

212
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,416
<i>Gonna set this dance alight</i>

213
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,462
<i>'Cause Saturday night's the night I like</i>

214
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,838
<i>Saturday night's alright
Alright, alright!</i>

215
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,264
Hey!

216
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,647
<i>Well, they're packed
Pretty tight in here tonight</i>

217
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,442
<i>I'm looking for a dolly
Who'll see me right</i>

218
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,692
<i>I may use a little muscle
To get what I need</i>

219
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,274
<i>I may sink a little drink
And shout out, "She's with me!"</i>

220
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,361
<i>A couple of the sounds that I really like</i>

221
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,493
<i>Are the sounds of
A switchblade and a motorbike</i>

222
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,872
<i>I'm a juvenile product
Of the working class</i>

223
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,295
<i>Whose best friend floats
At the bottom of a glass</i>

224
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:48,515
Fight!

225
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,430
<i>Don't give us none of your aggravation</i>

226
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,933
<i>We've had it with your discipline</i>

227
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,899
<i>'Cause Saturday night's
Alright for fighting</i>

228
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,021
<i>Get a little action in</i>

229
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,356
<i>Get about as oiled as a diesel train</i>

230
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,532
<i>Gonna set this dance alight</i>

231
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,654
<i>'Cause Saturday night's the night I like</i>

232
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:16,242
<i>Saturday night's alright
Alright, alright!</i>

233
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,191
Here you go, Dave.

234
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,984
They won't bite. Have a word.

235
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,023
Good show tonight, boys.

236
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,029
You look like you know
how to enjoy yourselves.

237
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,735
How'd you like to make
two quid a week?

238
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,696
Each.

239
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,457
Go on.

240
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,078
I'm a soul promoter.

241
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,161
And I've got two new American acts
doing a tour of England,

242
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,587
and they all need backup.

243
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,333
I'll need to know
by tomorrow, lunchtime.

244
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,635
So how does a fat boy from Pinner...

245
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,805
with glasses, called Reggie Dwight...

246
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,521
get to be a soul man, then, eh?

247
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,822
Write some songs.

248
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,121
I'm a skinny black kid...

249
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,911
from Detroit...

250
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,796
whose real name is Rodney Jones.

251
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,417
And I played roadside joints
for ten years...

252
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,091
before I realized what I had to do.

253
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,388
What, change your name?

254
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,176
It's not just your name.

255
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,431
You gotta kill the person
you were born to be

256
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,559
in order to become
the person you wanna be.

257
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,501
Have a good show.

258
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,129
It's on me hands.

259
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,302
Watch that, mate.

260
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,134
- Elton?
- Yeah?

261
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,892
I'm thinking of changing my name.

262
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:21,978
Yeah, great.

263
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,596
I'm thinking of changing it
to Elton Dean.

264
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,731
But that's my name.

265
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,230
Yeah, I know. What do you think?

266
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,482
I think, fuck off!

267
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:33,698
Right.

268
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,544
Piano players I've got. Ten a penny, mate.

269
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,041
I sing, too.

270
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,719
What sort of stuff?

271
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:56,763
Well, anything.

272
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,094
Rock, soul, country and western.

273
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:02,120
Bloody hell, I'm gonna shoot
the next piano player

274
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,555
who sings "Streets of Laredo."

275
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,932
Well, I write stuff, too.

276
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,373
That was good.
I mean, it could do with some words.

277
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,831
Yeah. That's the part I struggle with.

278
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,090
What's it called?

279
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,047
Oh, no, I just made that up.

280
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,796
Just now?

281
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,972
What did you say your name was again?

282
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,730
Elton.

283
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,483
Elton?

284
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,775
Elton what?

285
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:03,996
John.

286
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
Elton John.

287
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,452
What are you doing in my office?

288
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,287
Just taking a meeting.

289
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,963
I'll make you a cup of tea then,
shall I...

290
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:19,929
boss?

291
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:31,059
All right, Elton John the piano player.
Thank you so much for coming in.

292
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,470
- Leave your details on your way...
- Please, Mr. Williams.

293
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:34,861
Give me a chance.

294
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,655
All right.

295
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:40,861
See if there's anything interesting
in this one and set it to music.

296
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,271
Okay. Well, I'll see you soon.

297
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,273
- Thank you for coming in.
- Will I hear from you, or...

298
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,209
We'll be in touch.
We'll be in touch. Thank you.

299
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,208
Okay. Thanks so much for your time.

300
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,627
No worries. Come on.

301
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,939
One frothy coffee, no froth.

302
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,112
- Thanks.
- We close in an hour.

303
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,617
- Bernie Taupin?
- Yeah. You must be Elton?

304
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,703
- Yeah.
- Hi.

305
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,449
Well, that's my stage name.

306
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,991
You can tell me your real name
when we get to know each other better.

307
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,501
Right.

308
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,402
- I was thinking... Sorry.
- Have you ever... Sorry.

309
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,088
No, no, please. After you.

310
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,047
- I like your lyrics.
- Thank you.

311
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,220
Yeah, I got the tape you sent. It's great.

312
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,428
- Really good.
- Thanks.

313
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,890
Hang on. Don't bother with that one.
That wasn't supposed to be in there.

314
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,192
- That's sent by mistake.
- No, no, that's really good.

315
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,152
I wrote a tune to it.

316
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,193
- Yeah, I...
- "Border Song"?

317
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,776
Yeah. I read it and I could
hear the whole tune in my head.

318
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,657
It was all there,
I could see all the notes,

319
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,079
and I just had to get it out.

320
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,124
It was like my fingers couldn't
work fast enough to keep up with my brain.

321
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,071
Do you ever get anything like that?

322
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,289
Not really, no.

323
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,209
But I can write more
for you, though, Elton.

324
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,804
- I'll just send them down to you.
- Great. That'll be good.

325
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:27,974
Great.

326
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,557
My real name's Reg Dwight.

327
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:36,724
Cool. Yeah,
that sounds like a cowboy name.

328
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,479
Yeah, all I ever...

329
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,894
All I ever wanted to be
was a cowboy, you see.

330
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,571
Do you like country and western music?

331
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,281
- Yeah.
- It's good, isn't it?

332
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,408
Have you heard "Streets of Laredo"
by Marty Robbins?

333
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:51,747
That's good.

334
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,925
- It's a good song.
- It is good.

335
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,198
- Good.
- Yeah.

336
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,120
- Good song.
- Yeah, good song.

337
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,686
Well, anyway, all of these are great.

338
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,360
<i>He's my brother</i>

339
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:54,114
<i>Let us live
Let us live in peace</i>

340
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,158
Am I supposed to be impressed?

341
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,830
It's catchy, Dick. These guys are special.
I've got an instinct for these things.

342
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,161
All right, don't break your neck
sucking your own cock.

343
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,915
Maybe we could put these two
into a little beat combo.

344
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,213
He's the good-looking one.
We'll make him the singer.

345
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,762
Oh, no, hold on. I'm tone-deaf.
Elton is... He sings the songs.

346
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,216
Yeah, I could just take those
songs and leave, if you like.

347
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,518
Whoa, all right, no offense.
Don't get your knickers in a twist.

348
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,846
They are writing
a lot of great tunes, Dick.

349
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,556
There is one that's perfect for Lulu.

350
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,936
Easy, tiger.

351
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,898
You... You flatmates?

352
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,609
No, we live with our mums.

353
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,065
So I do the writing,

354
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,367
I send it down to him,
and then he adds the music.

355
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,945
Who ever heard of songwriters
not living together?

356
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,405
Yes, Lennon and McCartney
are inseparable.

357
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,999
- How many songs you got?
- Hundreds.

358
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,166
Play another one.

359
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,422
All right.

360
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,262
Depressing. Another one.

361
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,431
What the fuck's that about?

362
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,736
What, are you taking the piss?

363
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,704
Sounds like 99% of 'em are shit!

364
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,500
It's the one percent I'm interested in.

365
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,296
Ray says you're an investment.

366
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,583
But Ray knows fuck all.

367
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,468
You're a couple of pricks
as far as I can tell.

368
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,678
So quit that backing-band nonsense,

369
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,599
find a place to work together,
and write me tunes

370
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,018
that gray-haired old tramps'll
whistle in the street.

371
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,058
You never know.

372
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,731
One day, you might have
enough for an album.

373
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:51,106
Do that, and I'll put you
on ten quid a week.

374
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,585
My wonderful new lodgers!

375
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,760
- They're struggling rock stars.
- Hello. I'm Bernie.

376
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,427
Who ever heard of a rock star
with the name Bernie?

377
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,394
Lovely.

378
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,143
So what are your plans now... Elton?

379
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,321
Not too sure.

380
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,648
Written a lot of songs, haven't we?
Enough for an album.

381
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,450
And Elton's got himself a girlfriend now.

382
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,945
Arabella, our new landlady. Yep.

383
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,077
So what about rock 'n' roll?

384
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,044
What about hot chicks and cocaine orgies?

385
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,874
What about fame and fortune?

386
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,331
What about the fact that you're a fag?

387
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:00,389
A what?

388
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,259
Your little friend is a homosexual.

389
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,804
No, I've got a girlfriend.

390
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,479
When's that ever stopped anybody?

391
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:15,988
Are you?

392
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,035
Don't know.

393
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,872
Would it matter if I was, Bernie?

394
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,539
No, not to me.

395
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,257
Might matter to Arabella, though.

396
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,591
Yeah, mate, I'd agree on that.
Have you met her?

397
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,134
Fuck.

398
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:52,733
Sorry.

399
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,188
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

400
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,819
- Bernie...
- Okay. Sorry.

401
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,866
Shh! You, shh!

402
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,534
- You, shh!
- Bins everywhere.

403
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,993
- No, no, Bernie.
- What?

404
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:10,916
What is it now?

405
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,786
What am I gonna do?

406
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,630
You're going to tell her.

407
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,716
It'll break her heart.

408
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,253
Not sure she has one.

409
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,173
Would you please keep the noise down?

410
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,725
You'll wake up the whole bloody street!

411
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,681
- Come on.
- Yeah.

412
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,477
There's so much that we gotta do.
There's worlds to conquer.

413
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:41,109
I mean, America. Wide open spaces.

414
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,279
Tower Records.

415
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:47,995
Listen, the songs are great.

416
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,158
And people keep asking. They're, like,
"Who's that singing on the demos?" And I...

417
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,494
You are a shit-hot piano player,

418
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,079
you have an amazing voice,
and I'm telling you,

419
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,130
there is something
special that happens...

420
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,800
when you sing our songs.

421
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,383
You heard what Dick said.
He said my hands are like midget boxers.

422
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,839
Who cares what Dick thinks.

423
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,759
I just don't know if I'm...

424
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,223
what they're looking for.

425
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,768
It's time for you to be out front.

426
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,781
I love you, man.

427
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,240
I do, but...

428
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,912
not in that way.

429
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,177
Yeah.

430
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,592
Elton, time for bed.

431
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,971
We became inseparable after that.

432
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,853
The brother I never had.

433
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,818
Do you know, in 20 years,

434
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:05,649
we have never had a single argument.
Not once.

435
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,701
Anyway, I took his advice,
told Arabella.

436
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,949
She took it very well, actually.

437
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,704
You bastard!

438
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,081
She's killed my piano.

439
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,629
You treacherous beast!

440
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,462
Your music's as shitty as you are!

441
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,054
Hi, Mum.

442
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,756
I knew you'd be back.

443
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,346
You'll have to pay rent.
I'm not made of money.

444
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,394
- Morning.
- Good morning.

445
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,980
- Get dressed, Reggie!
- Elton.

446
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,948
I'm not having you
moping around here all day.

447
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,619
We're songwriting.

448
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,537
Oh, yeah? Looks like it's going well.

449
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,577
Right. I will not
have a mess in this house.

450
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,958
It's nice and tidy,
and that's how I want it to stay.

451
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,627
I'll not have a doss house
around here.

452
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,131
I can't do everything.
I can't cook and clean and wash.

453
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,297
Rely upon me to do everything.
It's not fair.

454
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:12,391
There's egg on this.

455
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,522
I'd better go take a shave, I think.

456
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,821
Thanks for breakfast.

457
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:57,301
<i>Feeling... In G</i>

458
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,779
<i>It's a little bit funny</i>

459
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,776
<i>This feeling inside</i>

460
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:18,281
<i>I'm not one of those who can</i>

461
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,704
<i>Easily hide</i>

462
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,170
<i>I don't have much money, but</i>

463
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,676
<i>Boy, if I did</i>

464
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,511
<i>I'd buy a big house where</i>

465
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,677
<i>We both could live</i>

466
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,441
<i>If I was a sculptor</i>

467
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,819
<i>But then again, no</i>

468
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:54,822
<i>Or a man who makes potions in a</i>

469
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,778
<i>Traveling show</i>

470
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,789
<i>I know it's not much</i>

471
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:06,166
<i>But it's the best I can do</i>

472
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,841
<i>My gift is my song, and</i>

473
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,002
<i>This one's for you</i>

474
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,600
<i>So excuse me forgetting</i>

475
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,812
<i>But these things I do</i>

476
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,107
<i>You see, I've forgotten</i>

477
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,607
<i>If they're green or they're blue</i>

478
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,821
<i>Anyway, the thing is</i>

479
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:37,492
<i>What I really mean</i>

480
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,914
<i>Yours are the sweetest eyes</i>

481
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,870
<i>I've ever seen</i>

482
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,958
<i>And you can tell everybody</i>

483
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,710
<i>This is your song</i>

484
00:41:56,264 --> 00:42:00,508
<i>It may be quite simple, but</i>

485
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,263
<i>Now that it's done</i>

486
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:07,227
<i>I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind</i>

487
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:12,107
<i>That I put down in words</i>

488
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:16,031
<i>How wonderful life is</i>

489
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:21,996
<i>While you're in the world</i>

490
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:26,245
<i>I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind</i>

491
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:30,830
<i>That I put down in words</i>

492
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:35,255
<i>How wonderful life is</i>

493
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:39,930
<i>While you're in the world</i>

494
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:51,943
How was that?

495
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:57,231
I love it. Best thing I've heard
since "Let It Be."

496
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,149
Trans-fucking-Atlantic!

497
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,984
Always knew you boys could do it.

498
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,242
First thing I'm gonna do
is put you on a three-album deal.

499
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,995
- Three?
- A year.

500
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,910
And I got you a couple of nights
at the Troubadour.

501
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,247
- Doug Weston's an old friend.
- Hang on. The Troubadour?

502
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,667
- It's this really cool folk club in LA.
- Yeah, we know what it is, Ray.

503
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,822
Hang on. Now, let's not be hasty,
because the thing is,

504
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,240
I haven't even got a backing band yet.

505
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,051
No, I've sorted the backup band,
don't worry.

506
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,161
Dick, I don't wanna appear ungrateful,

507
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:25,746
but you can't just spring
the Troubadour on me.

508
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,853
Look, it's time to do
something bold, Elton.

509
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,768
Granted, America's a bit of a gamble,

510
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,857
and you fuck up and I'll kill ya.

511
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,403
But Ray'll go, too.
He'll keep an eye on you.

512
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:40,650
Buy yourself some new clothes.
Get something flashy.

513
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,152
Let 'em know who you are.

514
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,159
Put on a great fucking show,

515
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:49,791
and just don't kill yourself with drugs.

516
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,711
Yeah?

517
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,463
Yeah, all right.

518
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,001
I'm gonna have a massage.

519
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,466
Mary?

520
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,030
I know.

521
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,857
Tower Records, Tower Records,
Tower Records.

522
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,521
Friends of Dick!

523
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,474
Good to see you, Doug.

524
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:56,568
Ray.

525
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,979
How are you? So good to see you, man.

526
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,153
What'd you bring me?

527
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,981
Hey, Doug. Bernie. Nice to meet you.

528
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,282
- Hi, Bernie.
- Good morning.

529
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:05,994
Hi. I'm Elton.

530
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,366
Sweet. How are you?

531
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,448
Monday night at the Troubadour, man.

532
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,536
It's gonna blow your mind.

533
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,710
Be totally packed. You're gonna love it.

534
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,086
It's a bit different from what I expected.

535
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:18,173
Yeah?

536
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,207
Yeah, it's just a bit smaller.

537
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,213
Well, size is everything, my friend.

538
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,965
Neil Young played here last week

539
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,718
and there were people lined
around the block.

540
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,764
Man, it was just...
It was the best night ever.

541
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,347
- That's a cool hat.
- Yeah?

542
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,811
- You like it?
- I do like it, yeah.

543
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,644
I won that hat, in a bet.

544
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:38,400
- With Bob Dylan.
- Really?

545
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:39,486
- Yeah.
- That's cool.

546
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,608
Elton. This is the band. I'm just
gonna check they know what they're doing.

547
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,736
So, you want something to drink?
Get these guys whatever they want.

548
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,317
They just flew in from England

549
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,369
and, boy, their arms are tired.

550
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:58,207
Whoa, dude, what the hell are you wearing?

551
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:02,716
My stage gear.

552
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,461
Where's Reggie? Where's Reggie?
Reggie, Reggie, Reggie.

553
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,046
Neil Diamond is at the bar.
He's talking to Leon Russell

554
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,132
and half the fucking Beach Boys.

555
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,179
Jesus, shit, Bernie!

556
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:18,606
Reggie?

557
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:21,272
- Elton. I think you're overreacting.
- No.

558
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,942
Bernie, you are under-reacting.

559
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,399
They are the geniuses of American music.

560
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,173
I can't go out there in front of that lot!

561
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:33,410
Okay, okay. Then we'll tell Doug
to refund everyone's ticket,

562
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,536
- and we'll send everybody home.
- Where is he?

563
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,334
- Hey, Ray.
- You've signed a contract!

564
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:39,787
Dick's paid your fucking airfare!

565
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,338
Now get out there and play,
you little twat.

566
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,474
Well, come on then.

567
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,514
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

568
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,221
a rising star in rock and roll.

569
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:01,024
Please welcome,
all the way from London, England,

570
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:02,768
Elton John.

571
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,284
<i>I remember</i>

572
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,495
<i>When rock was young</i>

573
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,337
<i>Me and Suzie had</i>

574
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,632
<i>So much fun</i>

575
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:16,675
<i>Holding hands</i>

576
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,016
<i>And skimming stones</i>

577
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:27,482
<i>Had an old gold Chevy
And a place of my own</i>

578
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,904
<i>But the biggest kick I ever got</i>

579
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,987
<i>Was doing a thing
Called the Crocodile Rock</i>

580
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,119
<i>While the other kids
Were rocking round the clock</i>

581
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:39,619
<i>We were hopping and bopping
To the Crocodile Rock</i>

582
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,826
<i>Well, Crocodile Rocking
Is something shocking</i>

583
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,207
<i>When your feetjust can't keep still</i>

584
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:51,419
<i>I never knew me a better time
And I guess I never will</i>

585
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,343
<i>Oh, Lawdy Mama, those Friday nights</i>

586
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:58,176
<i>When Suzie wore her dresses tight</i>

587
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:04,186
<i>And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight</i>

588
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,578
One, two, three, four!

589
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,261
- It was so good! You were brilliant.
- Thanks.

590
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,062
- This is... This is Heather.
- Hi.

591
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,764
- Hello.
- You were amazing!

592
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,068
Thank you.

593
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,983
All right. Enough of this bullshit.

594
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,281
Who wants to go to a party at Mama Cass's?

595
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,402
I'm so drunk,
and Doug's just lent me his car.

596
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,261
- How cool is this, man?
- Yeah, great.

597
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:09,147
Apparently Dylan's here somewhere.

598
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:16,025
I'm gonna go to the teepee with Heather.

599
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,739
- Really? All right.
- Yeah.

600
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:20,952
Okay.

601
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:23,306
- You'll be all right, won't you?
- Yeah, of course.

602
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,330
Yeah, yeah.

603
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,955
So we still gonna go to Tower Records
tomorrow, then?

604
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:37,466
Well, she's talking about going to
some place called Paradise Cove tomorrow.

605
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,592
But we'll go another time, though.

606
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,218
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

607
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:44,642
Come on.

608
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,476
America, man.

609
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,433
Wide open spaces.

610
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,397
Beautiful girls.

611
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:53,562
It's a dream come true.

612
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,277
Cheers.

613
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,658
Let's stay here forever.

614

<i>Dancing in the sand</i>

Dom Perignon. '63. It's a good vintage.

641
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:53,617
No, thanks.

642
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,335
It's always important
to rely on the kindness of strangers.

643
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:07,386
John Reid.

644
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,176
Elton.

645
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,099
I know it all seems
a bit overwhelming at first,

646
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:16,473
but something makes me think
you'll get used to it.

647
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,264
In fact, I predict you could be

648
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,237
the best-selling artist in America
if you desire.

649
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:23,977
So you like the song then?

650
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,354
Not quite as much as the singer.

651
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,950
You don't realize what happened
at the Troubadour tonight, do you?

652
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,867
Look, I'm in music management,
and let me tell you,

653
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:42,705
there are moments in a rock star's life
that define who he is

654
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:47,793
and how people perceive him
as he ascends into the heavens.

655
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,467
You lit the blue touch paper.

656
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:57,010
Now we can all see you
shooting light and color

657
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:00,434
and magic into the night sky.

658
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:06,394
Where there was darkness,
there is now you.

659
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,526
Elton John.

660
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,527
You can do anything you want.

661
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:17,989
You can be anyone you want.

662
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,619
And it's gonna be a wild ride.

663
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:43,078
Our review from the <i>LA Times</i>
has been syndicated.

664
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,784
- Okay.
- Things are going crazy.

665
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:45,878
I've extended our stay.

666
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,883
We're in San Francisco tomorrow
for three nights.

667
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,651
- Ray, slow down.
- After that we fly to NYC,

668
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,837
then we're back here for two more shows,
and then...

669
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,427
Dick wants us back in London
to start the new album.

670
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:59,390
- Doug.
- "Rejoice. Rock music has a new star.

671
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:03,345
He's Englishman Elton John,
a 23-year-old,

672
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:08,900
whose debut at the Troubadour was,
in every way, magnificent."

673
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,103
It's happening, guys.

674
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:13,931
Just remember, when you get back...

675
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:15,649
four shows you owe me.

676
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,944
- You said...
- Four.

677
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,988
Did... You said four shows?

678
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,373
- Yes.
- That's not gonna work!

679
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,459
So...

680
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:30,330
will I see you when I get back?

681
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:33,758
Now, don't worry about me.
Go and enjoy your moment.

682
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,961
- That's what's important.
- Come to London with me.

683
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,838
I can't, but...

684
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,925
But next time I'm there,
I'll look you up. Promise.

685
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,560
Hey, I've opened the fucking house.

686
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,762
Don't be a bummer.

687
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,684
I'm gonna watch out front.

688
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:08,118
I love 'em.

689
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,875
These are extremely stylish boots
of my own design.

690
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,672
Can you even play the piano in those?

691
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,932
- It's never gonna last.
- Well...

692
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,018
Let's just enjoy it while we can.

693
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,987
Afternoon.

694
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,073
John.

695
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,199
Okay...

696
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:27,826
Guys, we're gonna stop there.

697
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,828
- You all right, darling?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

698
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,705
Kiki, would you mind
giving me five minutes?

699
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:34,336
- I'm gonna go in.
- He's actually quite busy.

700
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:36,757
Thanks.

701
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,126
- Nice job.
- Nice suit.

702
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,349
Hello.

703
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,810
- What are you doing here?
- Business.

704
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,184
And I promised if I was ever in town,
I'd look you up.

705
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,106
How long you staying?

706
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,567
Well, I'm not sure. That depends.

707
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:00,522
Don't make me beg.

708
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,232
I've been hearing your songs everywhere.

709
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,409
Makes it very hard
to stop thinking about you.

710
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,248
Really?

711
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:12,585
Elton, what's going on?

712
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,501
Are we going again
or shall we go for a pint?

713
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:22,009
Yeah, no, yeah, you should go for a pint.

714
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,476
What do you want, Elton?

715
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:40,779
Dinner with you.

716
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,856
You're so humble, it's embarrassing.

717
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:46,025
A millionaire rock star
who lives at home with his mum.

718
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,612
Things are serious now.

719
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,414
Be brave. Think big.

720
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,042
What do you really want?

721
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:03,547
<i>When I look back</i>

722
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:06,382
<i>Boy, I must have been green</i>

723
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,056
<i>Bopping in the country</i>

724
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,968
<i>Fishing in a stream</i>

725
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,061
<i>Looking for an answer</i>

726
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,940
<i>Trying to find a sign</i>

727
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,276
<i>Until I saw your city lights</i>

728
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,153
<i>Honey, I was blind</i>

729
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,653
<i>They said get back, honky cat!</i>

730
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:29,531
<i>Better get back to the woods</i>

731
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:32,284
<i>Well, I quit those days</i>

732
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:35,993
<i>And my redneck ways, and I</i>

733
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:42,173
<i>Oh, the change is gonna do me good!</i>

734
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:49,972
<i>You better get back, honky cat!</i>

735
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:52,800
<i>Living in the city ain't where it's at</i>

736
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:56,137
<i>It's like trying to find gold in a...</i>

737
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,226
<i>A silver mine</i>

738
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:01,480
<i>It's like trying to drink whiskey</i>

739
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,654
<i>Oh, from a bottle of wine!</i>

740
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:12,828
<i>Well, I read some books</i>

741
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,622
<i>And I read some magazines</i>

742
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:18,452
<i>About those high-class ladies</i>

743
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:21,162
<i>Down in New Orleans</i>

744
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:25,000
<i>And all the fools back home, well</i>

745
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:27,255
<i>They said I was a fool</i>

746
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:32,928
<i>Oh, believe in the Lord is the golden rule</i>

747
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:36,098
<i>They said get back, honky cat!</i>

748
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,763
<i>Better get back to the woods</i>

749
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:41,645
<i>Well, I quit those days</i>

750
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:45,399
<i>And my redneck ways, and I</i>

751
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:51,530
<i>Oh, the change is gonna do me good!</i>

752
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:08,466
No one's getting phased out, Dick.

753
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,722
Elton feels things will run more smoothly
if he has personal management.

754
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,952
- There's never been a problem before.
- And there isn't one now.

755
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:21,181
Look, there's loads of work
and commitments, tours, etcetera.

756
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,231
That's what I'll be doing,
personal management.

757
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:25,275
- Taking care of things.
- Is that right?

758
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,945
You realize I've got a contract
with Elton.

759
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,071
I've had that looked into,

760
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:31,677
and my client is quite entitled
to take on outside representation.

761
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,192
That's what you think.

762
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,989
You fucking poofter.

763
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,743
And you. You're happy
with this arrangement, are ya?

764
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,338
Right?

765
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:45,963
After all these years?

766
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:47,874
It's nothing personal, Dick.

767
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,055
Come on, Ray.

768
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,305
Best of luck to you, Elton.

769
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:07,565
Your very expensive painting
is upside down.

770
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:13,281
- After you, Mr. James.
- Thank you, Raymond.

771
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:16,829
Well...

772
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,447
that was absolutely horrible.

773
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:23,163
Don't worry, it's business.
Dick's a big boy, he'll be fine.

774
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:26,997
Mr. Reid, Lord Grade's office have called
about the Royal Variety Performance.

775
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,252
Apparently, the Queen Mother is a big fan.

776
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:32,426
Couldn't we have kept on Ray?
He's such a lovely guy.

777
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:34,003
"Lovely guy" is not a job.

778
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,305
This is a crucial time, Elton.

779
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:40,530
You and I are gonna
have to be more careful,

780
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,344
'cause the papers
have been sniffing around.

781
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:44,726
We can't give them
anything to speculate on.

782
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,270
I'm thinking of getting someone in
as your girlfriend.

783
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:50,486
- Doesn't that seem a bit excessive?
- No, no, no, no, no.

784
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,772
This is your career
and our business at stake.

785
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:55,233
If our sleeping arrangements get out...

786
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,568
- all of this is gone.
- Right.

787
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,075
And you're gonna have to
talk to your parents.

788
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,114
Make sure they know what to say.

789
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,968
Those are the first doors
reporters knock on.

790
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,962
- Hello, Reg.
- Hello, Dad.

791
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:25,638
Well, come on in.

792
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,107
Well, those are very fancy shoes.

793
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:31,403
Yeah.

794
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:34,448
I brought you something.

795
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:45,292
Why are you here, Reg?

796
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,087
The boys.

797
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,588
Dad, there's a Rolls-Royce outside.

798
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,214
Stephen, Geoff...

799
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,548
this is your brother, Reggie.

800
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,050
Half brother.

801
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,306
Not actually called Reggie anymore.

802
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,265
I thought maybe
once I'm back from touring,

803
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,039
you and I could get together, if you like.

804
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:14,357
I could get you some tickets
to my next concert.

805
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,273
Not really my thing.

806
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,952
Is it true you're worth 25 million pound?

807
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,622
Do you know, I don't actually know.

808
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:25,827
They're really proud of you.

809
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:30,624
Yeah, we've even got some of your records.

810
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:34,124
Why don't you go and get the album?
Grab us a pen.

811
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:43,633
You probably get asked this all the time,
but would you...

812
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,052
Would you mind signing this?

813
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,099
Yeah, of course.

814
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,822
No. Would you make it out to Arthur?

815
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,368
He's one of the blokes from work.

816
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,071
Yeah, he's a big fan.

817
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:07,874
Is he?

818
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:17,843
Perfect.

819
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:21,805
Right.

820
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:26,509
Well, looks like things worked out
really well second time around, Dad.

821
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:28,936
I suppose they have.

822
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:31,848
'Cause, you know, not everybody
gets a second chance.

823
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:40,023
The boys loved meeting
a real-life pop star.

824
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,532
Sure. Thanks, Dad.

825
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:44,036
Bye.

826
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,035
- When I grow up, Dad...
- Get inside.

827
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,538
What are you doing without your shoes on?

828
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:54,245
You're gonna be a draftsman.

829
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,331
Back inside.

830
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,532
What have you got to do to get
a fucking drink around here?

831
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:36,999
Will you stop sulking?

832
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:41,049
It has to be done
whether you like it or not.

833
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:43,718
Are you gonna be scared of her
your whole life?

834
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,015
Right, stop the car.

835
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,217
- Elton...
- I said, stop the car!

836
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:56,690
You're onstage in 15 minutes.

837
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:00,774
You're the big-shot manager.
You make my excuses.

838
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:04,527
Tell them I'm indisposed,
breaking my mother's heart!

839
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:06,984
Elton. Elton!

840
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:08,078
Drive 'round, Denis.

841
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:10,408
<i>Liberace!</i>

842
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:21,131
Pinner nine, seven, double-five.

843
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,584
- Mum, it's me.
<i>- I know who you are.</i>

844
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,342
Well, I've got something to tell you.

845
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:30,049
Reggie, we're gonna miss
the bit of the show with you on.

846
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,634
Look, shut up, Mum!

847
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:34,402
I'm not on telly yet, am I?
I'm talking to you.

848
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:37,691
I...

849
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:39,975
Me and John, we...

850
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,361
Well, the thing is...

851
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:50,069
I'm... a homosexual.

852
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:55,908
A poofter.

853
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:58,585
A fairy.

854
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:00,547
A queen.

855
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,427
Well, say something.

856
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:13,471
Oh, for God's sake, I know that.

857
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,144
Known for years.

858
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:22,147
- You don't mind?
- Frankly, I don't care.

859
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:25,988
But I'd rather you keep
that sort of thing to yourself.

860
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:30,659
I just hope you realize
you're choosing a life

861
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:32,236
of being alone forever.

862
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:35,706
You'll never be loved properly.

863
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:43,463
<i>Right. Got to go.</i>

864
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:54,550
She said I'll never be loved.

865
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,053
Don't ever put me in this position again.

866
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,626
You're onstage in 10 minutes,
so get over yourself and do the show.

867
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,607
We're running a business here,
you fucking idiot.

868
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,018
Don't ever put your hands on me.

869
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,656
Real love's hard to come by.

870
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:22,794
So you find a way to cope without it.

871
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:26,642
- You okay?
- Yeah.

872
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,528
Got the number-one album
in America. Again.

873
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:33,779
I'm about to embark on
the highest-grossing tour in rock history.

874
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,700
I'm personally responsible
for five percent

875
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:38,153
of all record sales on the entire planet,

876
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,990
and I have the biggest headdress
known to man.

877
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,949
So, yeah, I think I'm okay, Bernie.

878
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:44,376
It used to just be the two of us.

879
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:46,795
Now there's busloads of people
just to do the music.

880
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:48,622
Hang on, hang on, don't you wanna just

881
01:13:48,716 --> 01:13:51,254
go out there and sing without
this ridiculous paraphernalia?

882
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:55,012
You know, just be yourself, Reg?

883
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:59,098
Why the fuck would I want that, Bernie?

884
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:02,098
You wouldn't say this shit to me
if you were a real friend.

885
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:04,680
People don't pay to see Reginald Dwight.

886
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:07,312
They pay to see Elton John!

887
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:10,314
Don't ever tell me
how to do my fucking job!

888
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:18,328
Break a leg.

889
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:24,829
- You don't have to put up with this, Reg.
- Write the fucking lyrics, Bernie!

890
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:27,369
Let me deal with the rest.

891
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,671
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

892
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:37,129
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

893
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:41,217
<i>Please welcome Elton John!</i>

894
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:01,255
- Where am I?
- At your house in LA, Mr. John.

895
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,225
Right.

896
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:06,935
I'll put some coffee on.

897
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:19,110
Darling, I've been thinking,
maybe we should quit the booze

898
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,400
for a couple of days,
take some quality time together...

899
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:24,245
Afternoon.

900
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:26,873
Mr. Reid.

901
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:34,816
- What are you doing, John?
- Just a bit of rock 'n' roll.

902
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,833
Rock 'n' roll is not shagging
your secretary in front of the pool boys!

903
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,673
Rock 'n' roll is getting you
out of your bed in the morning.

904
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,801
Arranging 250 gigs
in 26 different countries.

905
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:46,429
Rock 'n' roll's actually
112 employment contracts,

906
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,681
insurance, copyright indemnity,

907
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:51,935
renegotiating your previously
insane contracts and wiping your arse.

908
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,864
You know, all you do, Elton,
is play the piano.

909
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:57,562
But for me, rock 'n' roll is an
87 million-dollar-a-year industry.

910
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,988
Maybe I just play the piano,
but you know what else I do?

911
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:02,653
I pay, John.

912
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:04,943
For everything.

913
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:07,571
Including this house,
which I'd like you to leave now.

914
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:11,208
You may still be my manager,
but you and me are finished.

915
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,205
- You're so predictable.
- No, not predictable.

916
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,786
I want to be by myself,

917
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,294
not with some asshole
who doesn't give a shit about me

918
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:21,297
and takes the piss day after day!

919
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:22,715
Get out!

920
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,467
Elton.

921
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:28,178
What are they doing here?

922
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:30,761
You told me to hire a jet
and fly them over for the gig.

923
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,731
- No, no, next week, John.
- It is next week.

924
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:36,399
I'm gonna go and fetch them a drink.

925
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,478
Darling, why don't you clean yourself up,
because you fucking stink.

926
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:42,986
Sheila! It's been too long.

927
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:46,030
- Beautiful woman.
- Hello, look at this, you lovely lot.

928
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,236
- Here we are.
- Hi, Nan.

929
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:51,289
- I can't believe I'm actually in America.
- I know.

930
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:53,095
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing? Good to see you.

931
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:54,910
- Elton.
- Hello, Mum.

932
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,417
Elton, darling, you remember the Andersons

933
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,714
- from next door, don't you?
- Yes, the Andersons.

934
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,291
How could we forget the Andersons?

935
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:02,677
- Hello.
- Hello.

936
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:07,848
And what a shy little boy you were.

937
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:09,807
Look at you now.

938
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:12,011
Elton, you must give them a tour.

939
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,582
- Yes, right now, go on.
- Yeah, okay.

940
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,188
Everyone, Elton is giving a tour.

941
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,891
- Mum, you're on my gown.
- Don't be rude.

942
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:27,318
Here we go.
Come here, come here. Excited?

943
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,370
- Car.
- Yeah.

944
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:35,872
- Bernie, how's it going, man?
- Hey, man. How's it going?

945
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:37,623
No idea who he is. Of course.

946
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:54,640
Here he is!

947
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:56,976
Ladies, Elton.

948
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:58,102
- Hey.
- Hey.

949
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:01,059
What are you doing on your own up here?

950
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,394
Miserable bastard.

951
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:04,229
You're missing all the fun downstairs.

952
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:06,123
Well, as long as all the fun
isn't missing me,

953
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,736
then who gives a shit, Bernie?

954
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:12,664
We should get a drink.

955
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:16,534
- No, we should. Let's go get a drink.
- Come on, it's fine.

956
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:19,040
No, we absolutely should.
No, I'm telling you...

957
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:21,496
Yeah, go and get a little drink.

958
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,322
You look amazing.

959
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:58,784
Fucking prick.

960
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:12,964
For my next trick,

961
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,139
I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

962
01:20:48,302 --> 01:20:52,216
<i>She packed my bags
last night pre-flight</i>

963
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:58,427
<i>Zero hour, 9:00 a.m.</i>

964
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:06,480
<i>And you're gonna be high</i>

965
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:09,279
<i>As a kite by then</i>

966
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:18,496
<i>I'll miss the earth so much</i>

967
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:20,118
<i>I'll miss my life</i>

968
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:26,378
<i>It's lonely out in space</i>

969
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:34,797
<i>On such a timeless flight</i>

970
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,812
You self-indulgent prick.

971
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:28,192
Baby!

972
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:41,409
<i>And all this science I don't understand</i>

973
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:47,707
<i>It's just myjob five days a week</i>

974
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:55,010
<i>A rocket man</i>

975
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:58,087
<i>A rocket man</i>

976
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:11,442
<i>And I think it's gonna be
A long, long time</i>

977
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:15,067
<i>Till touchdown brings
Me 'round again to find</i>

978
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:18,195
<i>I'm not the man
They think I am at home</i>

979
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:20,277
<i>Oh, no, no, no</i>

980
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,283
<i>I'm a rocket man</i>

981
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:29,290
<i>Rocket man burning out
His fuse up here alone</i>

982
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:39,178
<i>And I think it's gonna be
A long, long time</i>

983
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:42,223
<i>Till touchdown brings
Me 'round again to find</i>

984
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:45,722
<i>I'm not the man
They think I am at home</i>

985
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:47,974
<i>Oh, no, no, no</i>

986
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:50,807
<i>I'm a rocket man</i>

987
01:23:52,236 --> 01:23:56,856
<i>Rocket man burning out
His fuse up here alone</i>

988
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:03,745
<i>And I think it's gonna be
A long, long time</i>

989
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:10,668
<i>And I think it's gonna be
A long, long time</i>

990
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:46,455
Elton.

991
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:53,244
- Elton.
- Yes, sorry. You were saying?

992
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,876
I was saying that I think I need a break.

993
01:24:57,134 --> 01:24:58,500
You need to take a break?

994
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:01,712
I think that I just need to go
and sort myself out a bit.

995
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:05,510
What?

996
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:09,015
I'm going home... for a while.

997
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,304
Well, that's nice for you.

998
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:15,562
Why can't we just, you know,
both of us just disappear together?

999
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:19,905
My ranch.

1000
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:22,239
We'll go to my ranch, we'll hide away.

1001
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:24,408
We can write like we did.

1002
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:27,662
Like we used to.

1003
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:31,082
We should go home, Elton.

1004
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:33,410
Reconnect.

1005
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:39,589
No, you should go.

1006
01:25:41,428 --> 01:25:43,670
There are other writers
I'd like to work with anyway.

1007
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:48,057
Do me good.
Collaborate with other people.

1008
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:51,102
I think it's a really good idea.

1009
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:17,458
My loyal subjects.

1010
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:24,135
Hello, hello, Australia. G'day.

1011
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:26,679
Shit, or New York?

1012
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:30,011
Swindon. Or wherever the hell we are.

1013
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:34,308
Well, if you don't like it, go home.

1014
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:37,982
It's what everyone else
seems to be doing at the moment.

1015
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:44,489
Anyway, here's one
for all the sober people.

1016
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:03,625
<i>Hey, kids, shake it loose together</i>

1017
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:05,130
<i>The spotlight's hitting something</i>

1018
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,257
<i>That's been known to change the weather</i>

1019
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:09,339
<i>We'll kill the fatted calf tonight</i>

1020
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:10,890
<i>So stick around</i>

1021
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:15,345
<i>You're gonna hear electric music</i>

1022
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:18,853
<i>Solid walls of sound</i>

1023
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:22,776
<i>Say, Candy and Ronnie
Have you seen them yet?</i>

1024
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:24,855
<i>Ooh, but they're so spaced out</i>

1025
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:28,616
<i>She's got electric boots
A mohair suit</i>

1026
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:31,445
<i>You know, I read it in a magazine</i>

1027
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,373
<i>B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets</i>

1028
01:28:34,601 --> 01:28:36,763
<i>I just hope you realize
you're choosing a life</i>

1029
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:38,094
<i>of being alone forever.</i>

1030
01:28:38,188 --> 01:28:40,305
You'll never be loved properly.

1031
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:41,889
When are you going to hug me?

1032
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:44,068
<i>Don't be soft.</i>

1033
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:46,902
<i>Life gives you
very few chances, Reggie,</i>

1034
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:47,988
<i>and this is one of yours.</i>

1035
01:28:48,073 --> 01:28:50,065
<i>- Who are you?
- You can do anything you want.</i>

1036
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:53,530
<i>You can be anyone you want.
What do you really want?</i>

1037
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:55,828
<i>And what a shy little boy you were.</i>

1038
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:57,405
<i>Look at you now.</i>

1039
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,865
<i>What do you really want?</i>

1040
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,543
<i>I'm going home... for a while.</i>

1041
01:29:34,411 --> 01:29:35,527
What do you want? I'm busy.

1042
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,862
Why don't you get back
in the studio you're paying for?

1043
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:41,999
Why don't you sell my fucking records?
What's this?

1044
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:45,457
Number 11 in Italy.

1045
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:47,584
The song doesn't work, that's the problem.

1046
01:29:47,674 --> 01:29:49,336
The record's coked-out MOR shit.

1047
01:29:49,426 --> 01:29:50,426
No, the problem...

1048
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:54,925
is you have never understood me...

1049
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:57,514
and what I have to go through.

1050
01:29:57,976 --> 01:30:00,162
And you know what?
I should've sacked you when you left me.

1051
01:30:00,186 --> 01:30:03,020
I am glad I left you.
It means I can maintain some objectivity

1052
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:05,849
in your self-indulgent,
myopic little world.

1053
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:08,025
Get in the studio
and make some music or don't.

1054
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:09,445
I don't care.

1055
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:16,442
Well, you will when your money runs out.

1056
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:23,199
Do your worst. In fact, take me to court.

1057
01:30:23,293 --> 01:30:25,501
You signed contracts with me years ago.

1058
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:29,372
So I'll still be collecting my 20%
long after you've killed yourself.

1059
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:32,549
Get out of my fucking house!

1060
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:35,679
Fuck off!

1061
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:45,522
It's fantastic.

1062
01:30:48,568 --> 01:30:50,608
- Would you like to hear it again?
- Not really, no.

1063
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:54,981
Would you like a cup of tea?

1064
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:57,776
Not got anything stronger?

1065
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:02,530
You should be very proud.

1066
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:07,665
I've watched you play many times,
and your music is always so...

1067
01:31:08,088 --> 01:31:10,080
personal and honest...

1068
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:12,508
and open.

1069
01:31:16,763 --> 01:31:18,504
It must be lonely sometimes.

1070
01:31:35,949 --> 01:31:37,986
<i>I can't light</i>

1071
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:44,781
<i>No more of your darkness</i>

1072
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:52,084
<i>All my pictures</i>

1073
01:31:52,882 --> 01:31:56,296
<i>Seem to fade to black and white</i>

1074
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:04,926
<i>I'm growing tired</i>

1075
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:11,478
<i>And time stands still before me</i>

1076
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:18,276
<i>Frozen here</i>

1077
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:23,528
<i>On the ladder of my life</i>

1078
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,577
<i>Too late</i>

1079
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:38,464
<i>To save yourself from falling</i>

1080
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:45,766
<i>Take a chance</i>

1081
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:50,972
<i>Change your way of life</i>

1082
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:59,355
<i>- But you misread
- But you misread</i>

1083
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:06,203
<i>- My meaning when I met you
- My meaning when I met you</i>

1084
01:33:10,919 --> 01:33:13,161
<i>- Closed the door
- Closed the door</i>

1085
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:16,668
<i>- And left me
- And left me</i>

1086
01:33:16,758 --> 01:33:21,344
<i>- Blinded by the light
- Blinded by the light</i>

1087
01:33:24,349 --> 01:33:29,890
<i>Don't let the sun go down on me</i>

1088
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:33,639
<i>Although I search myself</i>

1089
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:36,897
<i>It's always someone else I see</i>

1090
01:33:38,113 --> 01:33:42,904
<i>I'd just allow a fragment of your life</i>

1091
01:33:43,493 --> 01:33:49,114
<i>To wander free</i>

1092
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:54,210
<i>But losing everything</i>

1093
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:57,834
<i>Is like the sun going down on me</i>

1094
01:33:57,924 --> 01:33:59,916
- Morning.
- Morning.

1095
01:34:49,309 --> 01:34:50,309
I'm sorry.

1096
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:56,523
I know.

1097
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:04,651
Renate didn't deserve that.

1098
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:08,988
She's a good person.

1099
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:13,329
I dragged her into all my madness.

1100
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:17,326
Did being married make you happy?

1101
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:19,666
Not really. I'm gay.

1102
01:35:25,345 --> 01:35:26,381
I think...

1103
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:27,471
Hello, Mum.

1104
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:29,992
- Sir, would you like me to...
- Maybe a bit later, thank you.

1105
01:35:30,016 --> 01:35:31,302
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, son.

1106
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:33,225
- You all right?
- Yeah. Good.

1107
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:35,769
Just talking about poor Renate.

1108
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:38,264
Such a lovely woman.

1109
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:40,648
Divorce can be so painful.

1110
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:44,149
- Yeah.
- Anyway, celebration is in order.

1111
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:50,117
We found a lovely villa by the sea.

1112
01:35:50,203 --> 01:35:51,889
It'd be good if you would
talk to John today,

1113
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:54,576
get the money arranged.
Can't risk losing this one.

1114
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:55,952
Yeah, in Minorca.

1115
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:57,658
It is a lovely place. You should see it.

1116
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:58,752
Minorca, eh?

1117
01:36:01,965 --> 01:36:03,501
What do you want to go there for?

1118
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:05,586
Because you're driving me away.

1119
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:07,960
Every time we open a paper,

1120
01:36:08,054 --> 01:36:11,047
there's something about you
and the booze or the drugs, and...

1121
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:13,970
you're breaking your poor mum's heart.

1122
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:15,722
Tell you what, I'll write you a check.

1123
01:36:15,812 --> 01:36:17,098
So she can go buy a new one.

1124
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:19,805
Typical that you'd say
something like that about me,

1125
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:22,107
when I've given up so much for you.

1126
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:23,729
What have you given up for me?

1127
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:27,109
Your father... for a start.

1128
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:34,195
You really are a heartless monster.

1129
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,077
You know, I don't live my life
in black and white.

1130
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:46,457
And I do not want your fucked-up,
frigid ideas about anything.

1131
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:54,507
You know, I am so sick
of running away from who I am.

1132
01:36:57,562 --> 01:36:59,929
There's nothing wrong with success.
Or pleasure.

1133
01:37:00,023 --> 01:37:01,458
In fact, why am I apologizing for it?

1134
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:03,769
Mum, I have fucked everything that moves.

1135
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:08,233
And I've taken every drug known to man.

1136
01:37:08,323 --> 01:37:09,323
All of them.

1137
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:11,783
Do you know what?

1138
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:15,615
I enjoyed every last minute of it.

1139
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:18,781
Ever since you first dangled
your fat little legs

1140
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,662
in front of a piano, you've been lucky.

1141
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:24,541
You've never worked hard
for a bloody thing in your life.

1142
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:26,997
It all just comes to you.
You don't do anything.

1143
01:37:27,091 --> 01:37:29,048
And I'm the one who suffers.

1144
01:37:29,135 --> 01:37:31,593
I should never have had children.

1145
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:35,639
Do you know
how disappointing it is to be your mother?

1146
01:38:13,971 --> 01:38:17,089
<i>It's sad, so sad</i>

1147
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:20,926
<i>It's a sad, sad situation</i>

1148
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:27,274
<i>And it's getting more and more absurd</i>

1149
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:31,774
<i>It's sad, so sad</i>

1150
01:38:32,365 --> 01:38:35,699
<i>Why can't they talk it over?</i>

1151
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:37,867
<i>Oh, it seems to me</i>

1152
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:46,161
<i>Sorry seems to be the hardest word</i>

1153
01:38:46,963 --> 01:38:48,079
Some dessert, sir?

1154
01:38:49,424 --> 01:38:52,633
Yeah. Two chocolate puddings,

1155
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:55,131
an apple pie,
and a raspberry fool, please.

1156
01:38:55,221 --> 01:38:57,053
- Any ice cream?
- I...

1157
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:59,006
- Yeah, all of them.
- Excellent choice.

1158
01:39:04,897 --> 01:39:06,138
Where's Reid these days?

1159
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:12,821
Well...

1160
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:14,233
Does it matter?

1161
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:16,152
Hates my fucking guts.

1162
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:18,279
Nobody hates you, Elton.

1163
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:22,404
Campaign to kill yourself is going well.

1164
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:24,743
What are you doing here, Bernie?

1165
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:28,994
You left when it suited you.

1166
01:39:29,589 --> 01:39:31,296
Now you come back to lecture me?

1167
01:39:33,134 --> 01:39:35,717
'Cause the thing is,
the first time we actually got anywhere,

1168
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:36,919
you left, didn't you?

1169
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:39,087
Some girl was more important
to you than me

1170
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:41,890
and all those legends
who were welcoming us in.

1171
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:46,595
You left me
at the most important time, Bernie.

1172
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:48,813
When did you give up?

1173
01:39:50,693 --> 01:39:53,333
If you don't care about yourself,
how do you expect anyone else to?

1174
01:39:53,404 --> 01:39:55,487
Whenever I needed you most...

1175
01:39:57,158 --> 01:40:00,617
- you weren't there.
- It's not weak to ask for help.

1176
01:40:00,703 --> 01:40:03,571
I have worked my balls off
to get us out of the shit.

1177
01:40:04,665 --> 01:40:08,124
Day in, day out, for years.

1178
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:10,669
And now it's me
that can't walk down the streets.

1179
01:40:10,755 --> 01:40:13,919
It's me who doesn't have a life.

1180
01:40:14,967 --> 01:40:17,960
'Cause I don't get to sit around
with my feet on a desk,

1181
01:40:18,054 --> 01:40:19,886
chewing on the end of a fucking pencil.

1182
01:40:19,972 --> 01:40:21,950
"Write the lyrics, Bernie.
I'll take care of everything else."

1183
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:23,181
That was a test!

1184
01:40:26,145 --> 01:40:27,261
You should've known.

1185
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:29,433
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1186
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:37,233
<i>When are you gonna come down?</i>

1187
01:40:38,115 --> 01:40:40,198
<i>When are you going to land?</i>

1188
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:43,368
<i>I should have stayed on the farm</i>

1189
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:46,242
<i>I should have listened to my old man</i>

1190
01:40:47,542 --> 01:40:49,579
<i>Maybe you'll get a replacement</i>

1191
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:50,729
I'm getting the bill, am I?

1192
01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:53,461
<i>There's plenty like me to be found</i>

1193
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:57,007
<i>Mongrels, who ain't got a penny</i>

1194
01:40:57,093 --> 01:41:01,679
<i>Sniffing for tidbits like you
On the ground</i>

1195
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,256
Yeah, yeah, later. Bernie.

1196
01:41:08,813 --> 01:41:09,974
Come on, Bernie!

1197
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:12,898
<i>So goodbye yellow brick road</i>

1198
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:15,397
Don't be so dramatic. Coward!

1199
01:41:16,445 --> 01:41:19,813
Same as always!
Leaving me when things get too real!

1200
01:41:21,284 --> 01:41:24,027
<i>I'm going back to my plough</i>

1201
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:28,451
<i>Back to the howling old owl in the woods</i>

1202
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:33,286
<i>Hunting the horny back toad</i>

1203
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:38,257
<i>I've finally decided my future lies</i>

1204
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:42,511
<i>Beyond the yellow brick...</i>

1205
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:45,012
<i>Road</i>

1206
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:46,931
You fucking idiot!

1207
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:07,661
Bernie betrayed me.
The way everyone does.

1208
01:42:26,932 --> 01:42:28,389
<i>I heard that it was a heart attack.</i>

1209
01:42:28,476 --> 01:42:31,389
It's a chest infection, Mike.
He'll be fine.

1210
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:34,096
- How are ticket sales?
<i>- What the hell's that got to do with it?</i>

1211
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:35,431
<i>Every night is sold out.</i>

1212
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:38,938
- Well, add five more nights then.
<i>- Are you insane? He could've died.</i>

1213
01:42:39,028 --> 01:42:40,894
Just let me take care of things, Mike.

1214
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:42,591
I always get him
back on his feet, don't I?

1215
01:42:42,615 --> 01:42:46,074
<i>- Yeah, but are you gonna be able to...</i>
- Brilliant, man. He is gonna be there.

1216
01:43:27,243 --> 01:43:28,404
All right, you're good to go.

1217
01:43:44,635 --> 01:43:48,094
<i>So what do you think you'll do then?</i>

1218
01:43:53,519 --> 01:43:56,262
<i>I bet that'll shoot down your plane</i>

1219
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:06,946
<i>It'll take you
A couple of vodka and tonics</i>

1220
01:44:07,032 --> 01:44:09,445
<i>To set you on your feet again</i>

1221
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:16,281
<i>You know they can't hold you forever</i>

1222
01:44:19,879 --> 01:44:22,292
<i>I didn't sign up for you</i>

1223
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:27,509
<i>I'm not a present for your friends to open</i>

1224
01:44:27,595 --> 01:44:30,963
<i>This boy's too young to be singing...</i>

1225
01:44:31,056 --> 01:44:34,720
<i>The blues</i>

1226
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:37,302
Hey! Where are you going?

1227
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:46,023
<i>So goodbye yellow brick road</i>

1228
01:44:46,113 --> 01:44:49,026
<i>Where the dogs of society howl</i>

1229
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:53,281
<i>You can't plant me in your penthouse</i>

1230
01:44:53,704 --> 01:44:56,663
<i>I'm going back to my plough</i>

1231
01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:00,997
<i>Back to the howling old owl in the woods</i>

1232
01:45:01,378 --> 01:45:03,995
<i>Hunting the horny back toad</i>

1233
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:10,006
<i>I've finally decided my future lies</i>

1234
01:45:10,346 --> 01:45:15,558
<i>Beyond the yellow brick road</i>

1235
01:45:55,766 --> 01:45:57,758
<i>For as long as I can remember,
I've hated myself.</i>

1236
01:45:59,144 --> 01:46:00,430
Believed I'd never be loved.

1237
01:46:01,689 --> 01:46:04,682
Shows progress to take
responsibility for your actions.

1238
01:46:04,775 --> 01:46:08,234
Yeah, but I started
acting like a cunt in 1975.

1239
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,317
I just forgot to stop.

1240
01:46:18,122 --> 01:46:19,363
I do feel ashamed.

1241
01:46:22,251 --> 01:46:25,665
Spent so long feeling resentful
for things that just don't matter.

1242
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:35,132
Maybe I should've tried
to be more ordinary.

1243
01:46:41,812 --> 01:46:42,812
Hello, Nan.

1244
01:46:43,814 --> 01:46:45,601
You was never ordinary.

1245
01:46:46,901 --> 01:46:47,901
Look at you.

1246
01:46:49,153 --> 01:46:52,237
In here, talking about your feelings.

1247
01:46:53,282 --> 01:46:55,114
What a waste of time.

1248
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,943
Mum, I know it was never easy.

1249
01:46:58,829 --> 01:47:00,320
And I hope you can forgive me.

1250
01:47:02,374 --> 01:47:04,582
Because I've realized
that's what we need to do now.

1251
01:47:06,003 --> 01:47:07,414
Forgive each other.

1252
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,877
- No, your problem is you're selfish.
- No.

1253
01:47:13,177 --> 01:47:15,339
My problem was I believed
you loved me.

1254
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:17,428
And you're incapable of it.

1255
01:47:17,514 --> 01:47:20,598
I gave everything to keep something
that I never even had in the first place.

1256
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:24,977
I always thought
you was an introverted extrovert.

1257
01:47:25,856 --> 01:47:29,065
- A what?
- He's shy. He's always been shy.

1258
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:31,192
It's all his father's fault.

1259
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:35,147
Don't blame me.
He'd have been strange, regardless.

1260
01:47:35,950 --> 01:47:38,112
Actually, I think I'm okay with "strange."

1261
01:47:38,744 --> 01:47:41,202
God. Not him.

1262
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:43,621
Both of you. Stop.

1263
01:47:44,333 --> 01:47:47,246
I'm not going to allow you
to talk to me like this anymore.

1264
01:47:49,338 --> 01:47:50,874
It's about time you said that.

1265
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:56,552
Bernie.

1266
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:01,472
I never told you how much I need you.

1267
01:48:01,558 --> 01:48:03,345
No, no, no, I love you, man.

1268
01:48:06,146 --> 01:48:07,432
Always have, always will.

1269
01:48:09,149 --> 01:48:11,857
You write songs
that millions of people love.

1270
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:13,605
And that's what's important.

1271
01:48:14,530 --> 01:48:16,271
You just need to remember who you are...

1272
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:18,989
and be okay with it.

1273
01:48:19,702 --> 01:48:21,364
He doesn't know who he is.

1274
01:48:28,794 --> 01:48:29,875
Yes, I do.

1275
01:48:32,673 --> 01:48:34,335
I'm Elton Hercules John.

1276
01:48:36,135 --> 01:48:37,876
I thought you were Reggie Dwight.

1277
01:48:48,897 --> 01:48:50,729
I haven't been Reggie Dwight for years.

1278
01:49:05,372 --> 01:49:06,829
When are you going to hug me?

1279
01:49:40,324 --> 01:49:42,236
Impressed you know
how to use one of those.

1280
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:48,200
How you doing?

1281
01:49:50,167 --> 01:49:51,203
Good to see you.

1282
01:49:51,835 --> 01:49:54,043
Some days are tougher than others,
but I feel good.

1283
01:49:55,923 --> 01:49:57,255
They got a piano here?

1284
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:59,300
You been playing?

1285
01:50:00,094 --> 01:50:01,551
- No.
- No?

1286
01:50:01,637 --> 01:50:03,503
Not in the right place for that just now.

1287
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,756
I'm scared, Bernie.

1288
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:11,352
What if I'm not as good...

1289
01:50:14,108 --> 01:50:15,474
without the drink and the drugs?

1290
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:20,778
You know that's not true.

1291
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:24,594
You're not scared
you're not good without it,

1292
01:50:24,618 --> 01:50:25,984
you're scared to feel again.

1293
01:50:26,787 --> 01:50:29,279
You might be able to lie to yourself,
but you can't lie to me.

1294
01:50:33,961 --> 01:50:34,961
I should be going.

1295
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:39,132
Don't go.

1296
01:50:41,385 --> 01:50:42,385
Not yet.

1297
01:50:43,262 --> 01:50:44,902
This is the part
you gotta do on your own.

1298
01:50:46,557 --> 01:50:48,924
These... need music.

1299
01:50:59,444 --> 01:51:00,525
Thank you, Bernie.

1300
01:51:05,117 --> 01:51:06,233
You're my brother.

1301
01:52:10,724 --> 01:52:14,138
<i>You could never know what it's like</i>

1302
01:52:16,271 --> 01:52:20,732
<i>Your blood like winter
Freezes just like ice</i>

1303
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:25,653
<i>And there's a cold and lonely light</i>

1304
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:28,072
<i>That shines from you</i>

1305
01:52:29,826 --> 01:52:33,570
<i>You will wind up like the wreck you hide</i>

1306
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:37,908
<i>Behind that mask you use</i>

1307
01:52:38,752 --> 01:52:42,086
<i>And did you think this fool
Could never win?</i>

1308
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:46,299
<i>Well, look at me, I'm coming back again</i>

1309
01:52:48,387 --> 01:52:52,677
<i>I got a taste of love in a simple way</i>

1310
01:52:52,766 --> 01:52:56,601
<i>And if you need to know
While I'm still standing</i>

1311
01:52:56,895 --> 01:52:59,763
<i>You just fade away</i>

1312
01:53:01,108 --> 01:53:05,352
<i>And don't you know I'm still standing</i>

1313
01:53:05,445 --> 01:53:08,153
<i>Better than I ever did</i>

1314
01:53:09,992 --> 01:53:12,905
<i>Looking like a true survivor</i>

1315
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:16,989
<i>Feeling like a little kid</i>

1316
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:22,376
<i>And I'm still standing</i>

1317
01:53:22,462 --> 01:53:25,170
<i>After all this time</i>

1318
01:53:29,011 --> 01:53:32,504
<i>Picking up the pieces of my life</i>

1319
01:53:33,348 --> 01:53:37,934
<i>Without you on my mind</i>
