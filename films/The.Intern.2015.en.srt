1
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,108
{\an8}<i>Freud said, "love and work.
Work and love.</i>

2
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,744
{\an8}<i>That's all there is."</i>

3
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:19,714
{\an8}<i>Well, I'm retired,
and my wife is dead.</i>

4
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:23,885
{\an8}<i>As you can imagine, that's
given me some time on my hands.</i>

5
00:01:23,886 --> 00:01:26,020
{\an8}My wife's been gone
for three and a half years.

6
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:28,222
{\an8}I miss her in every way.
And retirement?

7
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:31,325
{\an8}That is an ongoing,
relentless effort in creativity.

8
00:01:31,326 --> 00:01:34,094
{\an8}At first, I admit
I enjoyed the novelty of it.

9
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,730
{\an8}Sort of felt like
I was playing hooky.

10
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:39,434
{\an8}<i>I used all the miles I'd saved
and traveled the globe.</i>

11
00:01:39,435 --> 00:01:41,868
{\an8}<i>The problem was, no matter where
I went, as soon as I got home,</i>

12
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:44,605
{\an8}<i>the nowhere-to-be thing
hit me like a ton of bricks.</i>

13
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:47,775
{\an8}<i>I realized the key to this whole
deal was to keep moving.</i>

14
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,745
{\an8}<i>Get up, get out of the house,
and go somewhere.</i>

15
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:52,713
{\an8}<i>Anywhere.</i>

16
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:56,118
{\an8}<i>Come rain or shine,
I'm at my Starbucks by 7:15.</i>

17
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:59,019
{\an8}Excuse me, mind if we join you?

18
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,621
{\an8}- No.
- Hey. How are you?

19
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:04,258
{\an8}<i>Can't explain it, but it makes
me feel part of something.</i>

20
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,126
{\an8}These guys today,
they're not numbers guys.

21
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:07,394
{\an8}Don't talk figures with them.

22
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:08,763
{\an8}<i>How do I spend
the rest of my days?</i>

23
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:12,734
{\an8}You name it.
Golf, books, movies, pinochle.

24
00:02:12,735 --> 00:02:14,168
{\an8}Tried yoga, learned to cook,

25
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:16,504
{\an8}bought some plants,
took classes in Mandarin.

26
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:19,273
{\an8}Xiang xin wo,
wo shen me dou shiguo le.

27
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:21,876
{\an8}Translation... "believe me,
I've tried everything."

28
00:02:21,877 --> 00:02:26,348
{\an8}<i>And then, of course,
there are the funerals.</i>

29
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,453
{\an8}<i>So many more
than I could imagine.</i>

30
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:34,621
{\an8}<i>The only traveling I do
these days</i>

31
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:38,259
{\an8}<i>is out to San Diego
to visit my son and his family.</i>

32
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,794
{\an8}<i>They're great.
I love them to pieces.</i>

33
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:43,130
{\an8}<i>But to be honest, I think
I probably relied on them</i>

34
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:44,865
{\an8}<i>way more than I should.</i>

35
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:47,701
{\an8}<i>Don't get me wrong,
I'm not an unhappy person.</i>

36
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:49,203
<i>Quite the contrary.</i>

37
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:54,075
<i>I just know there's a hole in
my life, and I need to fill it.</i>

38
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:56,043
<i>Soon.</i>

39
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,880
<i>Which brings me to today
when I was leaving the market</i>

40
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:03,751
<i>and caught your flyer
out of the corner of my eye.</i>

41
00:03:03,752 --> 00:03:05,354
Hmm.

42
00:03:07,456 --> 00:03:08,957
"Seniors, be an intern."

43
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,092
{\an8}Ben, I thought that was you.

44
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:12,093
{\an8}Hi.

45
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:12,827
Hey.

46
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:14,462
What'd you find?

47
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:17,331
I think an Internet place
is looking for senior interns.

48
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:19,300
- Am I reading this right?
- Let me see.

49
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:22,503
"Applicants must be
over 65 years of age...

50
00:03:22,504 --> 00:03:26,006
Have organizational skills, a
genuine interest in e-commerce,"

51
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:27,275
whatever that is...

52
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:29,276
"and a roll-up-your-sleeves
attitude."

53
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:32,347
Aboutthefit.com, isn't that
the outfit that was...

54
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:33,514
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:03:33,515 --> 00:03:35,683
They bought one of those
old factories in red hook.

56
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:38,352
My daughter says they
sell clothes on the Internet.

57
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:40,488
How that works, I have no idea.

58
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,057
Well, you have to
upload the application.

59
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:45,126
That could be challenging.
Listen to this...

60
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:47,261
"cover letters
are so old-fashioned.

61
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:49,664
Show us who you are
with a cover-letter video.

62
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:53,134
Upload your video
to Youtube or Vimeo using

63
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:57,071
.MOV, .AVI,
or a .MPG file.

64
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:59,140
We look forward to
meeting you."

65
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:00,541
Well, I guess that's meeting me.

66
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:03,877
{\an8}I swear I don't even know
what language that was.

67
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:06,047
{\an8}What are you doing tonight, Ben?

68
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:08,249
- A frozen lasagna?
- Well...

69
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,385
I could make a little salad,
turn it into a dinner for two,

70
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:14,522
like we did that time
and never did again.

71
00:04:14,523 --> 00:04:16,524
You know that was
over five months ago?

72
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:19,193
Oh, yeah. No, no, we got to
do that again, for sure,

73
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:21,195
but okay
if we take a rain check?

74
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:22,897
You're awful cute,
you know that?

75
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:24,932
- No, I didn't.
- Well, it's true, you are.

76
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,602
So I'll see you.

77
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:30,905
Don't take too long, doll.

78
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:32,940
You're not getting any younger.

79
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:35,943
- I know, I know, I know.
- All right.

80
00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:00,535
So here I am, applying to be
one of your interns

81
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:02,336
because the more
I think about this idea,

82
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:04,338
the more tremendous
I think it is.

83
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:07,041
I love the idea of having
a place I can go every day.

84
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:09,076
I want the connection,
the excitement.

85
00:05:09,077 --> 00:05:10,378
I want to be challenged,

86
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:12,747
and I guess I might even
want to be needed.

87
00:05:12,748 --> 00:05:15,183
The tech stuff might
take a bit to figure out.

88
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:16,917
I had to call
my 9-year-old grandson

89
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:19,454
just to find out
what a USB connector was.

90
00:05:19,455 --> 00:05:21,388
But I'll get there.
Eager to learn.

91
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:24,658
Also, I want you to know I've
been a company man all my life.

92
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:27,761
I'm loyal, I'm trustworthy,
and I'm good in a crisis.

93
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:29,530
<i>And I love that
you're right here in Brooklyn.</i>

94
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:31,465
I've lived here all my life,
and lately I feel

95
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:33,300
I may not be hip enough
to live in Brooklyn,

96
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:35,570
so this could help with that,
too.

97
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:37,805
I read once,
musicians don't retire.

98
00:05:37,806 --> 00:05:40,041
They stop when
there's no more music in them.

99
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:44,378
Well, I still have music in me,
absolutely positive about that.

100
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:16,243
{\an8}Good news,
I found a size eight in Navy.

101
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:19,180
No, you are right. That package
should have arrived by now.

102
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:20,548
Let me track that for you.

103
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:22,716
Yep, these pants are awesome
if you have hips.

104
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:24,018
Super slimming.

105
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:26,153
Okay, let me just
review this with you...

106
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:27,889
you have six bridesmaids.
You ordered six

107
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,057
of the silk chiffon
antoinette dresses in pink.

108
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:31,625
The wedding is in three days,

109
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:35,495
and the dresses just arrived
all in charcoal gray.

110
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:39,266
Which we don't even sell,
so that is a bit of a mystery.

111
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:41,001
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do about this.

112
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:43,404
I am gonna call the vendor
and have this fixed today.

113
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:45,873
I will personally see the
dresses before they are Fedexed.

114
00:06:45,874 --> 00:06:48,042
And I promise you
they will be at your front door

115
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:49,977
by 9:00 A.M. Friday,
okay?

116
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:51,812
You know what, let me give you
my cell, just in case...

117
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:54,748
718-555-0199.

118
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,783
Oh, thank you so much
for your patience.

119
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:59,153
And I am gonna refund you back
all your money.

120
00:06:59,154 --> 00:07:00,421
It's the...

121
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:02,957
yes. N...

122
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:06,160
okay, hey, you check this one
off your list, okay?

123
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:07,394
This is done.

124
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:10,531
And, Rachel,
have a great wedding.

125
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:12,666
Oh, my God, how did that happen?

126
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:13,735
Jules?

127
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:15,202
I know, I know,
I'm late for something.

128
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:16,504
Yeah, everything.

129
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:18,106
You see why I take
customer-service calls?

130
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:19,607
I mean, it's so good.
You learn so much.

131
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:21,375
Okay, what's up?
What am I doing?

132
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:23,243
Okay, Cameron was waiting for
you but had another meeting.

133
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:25,012
He said
he'll be back at 2:00.

134
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:27,615
- Everyone needs you to sign off on tomorrow's homepage.
- Right.

135
00:07:27,618 --> 00:07:29,484
And your 11:00 is in
the big conference room.

136
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:31,752
So is your 11:10.
Finance needs you,

137
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:33,353
and I guess you
e-mailed a bunch of people

138
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:34,555
at 4:00 A.M.
about something?

139
00:07:34,556 --> 00:07:36,324
Oh, good, I forgot about that.

140
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,292
I want to figure out a way for
friends to shop together online.

141
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:39,826
Make it less of an alone thing.

142
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,164
- E-mail me that idea, will you?
- Yeah, I like that.

143
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:43,897
Um, is now a good time
to call your Mom back?

144
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:45,032
Dude, I'm on a bike.

145
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,368
Happy birthday!

146
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:48,769
Come on.

147
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,372
Oh.

148
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:54,042
Oh, what a mess. This is
the middle of the office.

149
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:55,676
Don't... don't...
don't put that...

150
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:05,252
- Hello.
- Hi.

151
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:06,520
I'm Ben Whittaker.

152
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:08,256
I received an e-mail
about an interview

153
00:08:08,257 --> 00:08:09,991
for the senior intern program.

154
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:11,258
Hey, Ben.
How's it going?

155
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:12,726
It's going good, real good.
Thank you.

156
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:14,495
Excellent.
Take a seat around the corner,

157
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:16,663
and someone from talent
acquisition will come get you.

158
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,899
Thank you.

159
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,501
"Talent acquisition"?

160
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:32,346
Okay, you guys have to remember,

161
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:33,914
the homepage
has to read in a glance.

162
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:35,783
- Right.
- Also, you have to get back like this

163
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:38,352
if you want to see what looks
like if you're, like, over 35.

164
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:40,788
Okay, so I can't read anything,

165
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,923
but if I could,
what do you want me to see?

166
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:45,560
"Five girls, one shirt"
or "check out the fit"?

167
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:47,461
Well, both, but
what I really want you to see

168
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:49,563
is the shirt worn by
five different body types.

169
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:51,432
Okay, then
you got to make me see that.

170
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:53,634
Try making the photo grid
bigger.

171
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:55,936
I love that five.
Can we make it more graphic?

172
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:57,205
Yeah, that's cool.

173
00:08:57,206 --> 00:08:59,273
Maybe hero
the girl in the red shirt.

174
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:00,540
- Jules...
- That is a great red.

175
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,276
It is going to fly out of here.

176
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:04,612
I needed you to sign off
on this, like, two hours ago.

177
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:06,446
I know, I know, but can you try?

178
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:07,515
Yep.

179
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:09,250
Mia?
Tell me that thing again.

180
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:12,386
Oh, 40% of our visitors
don't go past the homepage.

181
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:14,355
Which isn't so bad.

182
00:09:14,356 --> 00:09:15,890
Yeah, but we should fix that.

183
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:17,558
Okay, here you go.

184
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,493
I love it.

185
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:19,927
Great, and it's up.

186
00:09:19,928 --> 00:09:21,462
Okay.
Thanks, everybody.

187
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:24,031
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

188
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:26,734
Let's go over
the pitch for Friday.

189
00:09:26,735 --> 00:09:28,401
Okay, so...

190
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,603
The Antoinette dress.

191
00:09:29,604 --> 00:09:31,305
Major screw-up by the vendor.

192
00:09:31,306 --> 00:09:33,607
There's gonna be a couple of
interviews today, Ben.

193
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:36,510
We want to make sure that
we both find the right fit.

194
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,479
Business as usual
is not really our motto,

195
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,447
so we hope
you have some fun here.

196
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:43,150
This is the first time we're
hiring senior interns,

197
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:44,384
so some of our intern questions

198
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:46,154
may not exactly fit
your profile,

199
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:48,088
but we're gonna go for it
anyway, okay?

200
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,190
Fire away.

201
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:50,257
Okay, good.

202
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:51,792
Where'd you go to school?

203
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:52,893
I went to Northwestern.

204
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:55,062
Hey, my brother
went to Northwestern.

205
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:56,564
Probably not at the same time.

206
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:59,132
Probably not.
He graduated in 2009.

207
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,936
Class of '65.

208
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:02,936
Wow, what was your major?

209
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:04,673
Do you remember?

210
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:08,709
And after Northwestern
you went on to...?

211
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,277
I went to work for Dex one.

212
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:11,530
Okay, and they made...?

213
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:12,780
Phonebooks.

214
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,314
I was in charge of overseeing

215
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:15,816
the printing
of the physical phonebook.

216
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:17,652
I did that for over 20 years,
and before that,

217
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:19,620
I was their
V.P. of sales and advertising.

218
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:21,822
So, do they still
make phonebooks?

219
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,090
I mean, doesn't everyone
just Google numbers?

220
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,360
I believe they do, but before Google
that was how you got a number.

221
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:28,362
Oh, no, no.
Yeah, I... I get it.

222
00:10:28,363 --> 00:10:30,064
So 40 years
at the phonebook company?

223
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:32,099
That is amazing, seriously.

224
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,567
Okay, Benjamin.

225
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:35,636
Now, I'm gonna ask you one of
our more telling questions

226
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:37,404
for all of our interns,
so I want you to, like,

227
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:39,106
this is the one
to really think about, okay?

228
00:10:39,107 --> 00:10:40,774
And...
and take your time.

229
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:42,945
Where do you see yourself
in 10 years?

230
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:45,913
When I'm 80?

231
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:47,814
Yeah, sure.

232
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:48,816
Yeah, whatever.

233
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:50,418
Um...

234
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:52,186
Wait.
Did not realize you were 70.

235
00:10:52,187 --> 00:10:54,888
That's, uh... that question just
doesn't work for you, does it?

236
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,790
Should we just scratch that one
and just move on?

237
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,259
- It's your call, Justin.
- Okay, that one's gone.

238
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,661
You look great, by the way.
So great.

239
00:11:00,662 --> 00:11:02,630
And you're clearly more than
qualified for this job.

240
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:04,130
You're actually, like,
way overqualified,

241
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:05,298
and we were so impressed.

242
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,300
You had great interviews,
great video.

243
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:09,270
You nailed it, Ben.
Congrats.

244
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:10,838
You're an intern.

245
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:11,939
- Hey.
- Hi.

246
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,507
I need you for two minutes,
uninterrupted.

247
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:14,808
- Okay.
- Remember a few weeks ago,

248
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:16,476
we talked about
the senior intern program?

249
00:11:16,477 --> 00:11:18,045
- No.
- Really? We had a...

250
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:20,147
we had a whole, big conversation
about it.

251
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:21,515
We did?
Okay, remind me.

252
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:22,983
Seniors in high school
or college?

253
00:11:22,984 --> 00:11:24,085
No, no, no, no.

254
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:26,320
Seniors in life.
Older people.

255
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:27,821
Hold on, what?

256
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:29,990
I told you I felt like we needed
to do an outreach program.

257
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:31,892
You definitely seemed to be
liking the idea,

258
00:11:31,893 --> 00:11:33,927
so I set it in motion.
It's gonna be great.

259
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:35,295
Hold, please.

260
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:37,497
You're hiring
senior citizen interns?

261
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:39,000
There's been
a ton of research on this,

262
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:41,735
and the results
are actually incredible.

263
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:44,571
I mean, imagine having an intern
with a lifetime of experience,

264
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:45,973
as opposed to somebody who spent

265
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:47,808
the last four years of their
life playing beer pong.

266
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,576
Do they eventually
want jobs here?

267
00:11:49,577 --> 00:11:51,445
No, darling,
they're all retired.

268
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:53,447
They... they just want
the experience.

269
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:56,383
And I would like one
to work directly with you.

270
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:58,519
Wait, Cameron, no.

271
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,721
First of all,
I'm not great with older people.

272
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:02,556
You know how I am
with my parents.

273
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:04,325
This could be...

274
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:05,559
Why do I have to have one?

275
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,060
Because you have to
set the tone.

276
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,563
Now, would you prefer
a man or a woman?

277
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:11,665
There's a great
72-year-old woman, really cute.

278
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,334
That's like the same age
as my Mom.

279
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:14,735
- That's too weird.
- That's fine.

280
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:16,637
There's a man everyone loves.
He seems amazing.

281
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:18,505
I watched his video
with the whole group.

282
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:20,975
People were crying.

283
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:23,310
Okay, this is not going to work,
in my opinion.

284
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:25,379
But how long
do I have to do this for?

285
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,348
- Minimum?
- Six weeks or we'll be sued.

286
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:30,751
I know we never
talked about this.

287
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:32,653
Yeah, we did.
For real.

288
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:34,455
He starts tomorrow.

289
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:50,005
Mm.

290
00:12:57,545 --> 00:12:59,513
Back in action.

291
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:01,948
Thank God.

292
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,685
New interns, welcome to ATF.

293
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:06,987
We all work on this one floor,
and that is because

294
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:10,324
we are all about
communication and teamwork.

295
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:11,692
No one has a private office,

296
00:13:11,693 --> 00:13:14,027
not even our Founder and CEO,
Jules Ostin,

297
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:17,230
who is actually
right over there.

298
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:19,800
She loves to ride her bike
through the office.

299
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,802
That woman does not
like to waste time.

300
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:23,970
Plus, she counts it as exercise.

301
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,538
That's adorable.

302
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,407
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

303
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:29,576
Hey. How you doing?
I'm Davis.

304
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:30,877
Hi, Davis.
Ben Whittaker.

305
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:32,913
- Exciting place, huh?
- Oh, my God.

306
00:13:32,914 --> 00:13:35,649
They had one opening for a
regular-age intern, no offense.

307
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,785
I got it.
I'm so psyched.

308
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:38,985
I'm pretty psyched myself.

309
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,888
All right,
a few words about Jules.

310
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:43,023
She started about the fit
only 18 months ago.

311
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:45,225
This whole idea was hatched
at Jules' kitchen table

312
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:46,494
right here in Brooklyn.

313
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:48,095
Jules tried everything on
that she sold,

314
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:49,162
described the fit herself,

315
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,731
and apparently it worked.

316
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:54,168
She was online in four months.

317
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,370
She started with 25 employees.

318
00:13:56,371 --> 00:13:58,072
She's now up to 216.

319
00:13:58,073 --> 00:13:59,873
With you 4, 220.

320
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:01,107
Wow.

321
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,176
Hey, Ben, are you gonna
wear a suit every day?

322
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:05,278
- You bet.
- Confident.

323
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,546
I like how you roll.

324
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:08,549
I like it a lot.

325
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:14,721
We just hit a record high
of 2,500 likes on Instagram.

326
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:15,840
Yeah!

327
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,594
And that's what we do

328
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:22,362
when something good
happens around here.

329
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:23,763
New interns, grab a seat

330
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:25,399
at one of the intern tables
over there.

331
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,701
Check your e-mail. You may find
that you've been assigned

332
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:30,570
to one particular person
or one particular team.

333
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:32,039
Or you might just be a floater.

334
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,407
It's all good.

335
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:36,076
Okay, let me Instagram this.

336
00:14:36,077 --> 00:14:37,544
Moment in time.

337
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:39,680
Gray is the new green.

338
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:40,948
Take a seat.

339
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:29,830
Thanks.

340
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,401
Got one.

341
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:37,171
{\an8}<i>"Welcome Ben!
Your internship will be</i>

342
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:39,773
<i>directly with our founder,
Jules Ostin."</i>

343
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:42,509
Oh, I'm in the photo studio.

344
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,545
Floater.
Love!

345
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:45,946
Hey, Ben, what'd you get?

346
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:48,114
Looks like I'm gonna be
a personal intern.

347
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,516
Nice. To?

348
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:50,718
Jules Ostin.

349
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:52,854
Unfortunate.

350
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:55,356
Hang in there.

351
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,428
"Hi Ben,
I have secured an appointment

352
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:04,330
for you to meet with
Jules Ostin today at 3:55 P.M.

353
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:08,068
Please be prompt as Jules has
another meeting at 4:00 P.M."

354
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:11,104
Hmm.

355
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:14,240
All right,
I'm going to merchandising.

356
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,644
Beautiful.

357
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,160
It's perfect.

358
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:35,228
Yes, I'll try to
have her there at 5:00.

359
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:36,729
Um, no, wait.

360
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,565
I booked her with a vendor
at 5:15.

361
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:40,400
I'm sorry.

362
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:42,236
I'll call you back.

363
00:16:42,237 --> 00:16:43,503
Yes, hello?

364
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:44,872
Hi.
I'm Ben Whittaker.

365
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:47,374
I have a 3:55 appointment
with Ms. Ostin.

366
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,776
3:55?

367
00:16:48,777 --> 00:16:50,610
I thought she was meeting with
her new intern.

368
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:52,379
That's me.

369
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,248
How you doing?

370
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:56,617
I'm sorry, uh,
how are you an intern?

371
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:59,252
W... it's the new
senior intern program.

372
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:01,155
It just started today.

373
00:17:01,156 --> 00:17:02,356
Oh, my God.

374
00:17:02,357 --> 00:17:04,124
Um...

375
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,225
How old are you?

376
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:07,160
70. You?

377
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:08,362
I'm 24.

378
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:09,429
I know, I look older.

379
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,531
It's the job.
It ages you.

380
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:12,533
Which won't be great
in your case.

381
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:13,834
Sorry.

382
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,635
I actually thought
you looked younger.

383
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,570
Yeah, right.

384
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:20,709
Any tips before I go in?

385
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:23,777
Just talk fast.
She hates slow talkers.

386
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:25,613
Maybe that's just
when I talk slow.

387
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:27,548
Don't dawdle in any way.
Just keep it moving.

388
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:29,849
And don't forget to blink.

389
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,284
- Blink?
- Yeah.

390
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:33,320
She hates when people don't
blink. It weirds her out.

391
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:35,121
But it's 3:57.
This meeting that she's in

392
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:37,724
just took up like two of your
f... they're out. Go, go, go.

393
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:39,626
- Okay, thanks.
- Go. Yeah.

394
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:40,660
What?

395
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:42,062
Oh, yeah, I'm here.

396
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:44,464
Hi, Jules?

397
00:17:44,465 --> 00:17:46,767
I'm Ben, your new intern.

398
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:48,868
I'm glad you also
see the humor in this.

399
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:51,271
Be hard not to.

400
00:17:51,272 --> 00:17:53,473
So, Ben...

401
00:17:53,474 --> 00:17:56,043
I was gonna say
what is a nice guy like you

402
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:57,210
doing at a place like this?

403
00:17:57,211 --> 00:17:59,012
But Cameron gave me the drill,

404
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:00,480
so can I just
be honest with you?

405
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:01,715
Please.

406
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:03,550
I'm not gonna have
a lot for you to do.

407
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:04,884
That's the truth.

408
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:07,387
And you being assigned to me
is kind of just

409
00:18:07,388 --> 00:18:10,157
for me to set an example
for the rest of the team.

410
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:13,159
If you ask me, I think
that you'd be much better off

411
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,695
working in creative
or marketing.

412
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:15,962
It's a little bit slower pace,

413
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:17,430
maybe a little bit
easier to grasp.

414
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,766
If you requested to transfer,
we can make that happen.

415
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,434
If that's what you'd prefer.

416
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:25,405
You'll be happier, believe me.
I am not so fun to work for.

417
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:28,408
That's what I gather,
but I can get along with anyone,

418
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:30,477
and I'm here to
learn about your world,

419
00:18:30,478 --> 00:18:32,145
give help where I can, so...

420
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:34,614
So, you don't want to transfer?

421
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:35,815
Not really, sir.

422
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:38,151
I'm terribly sorry.

423
00:18:38,152 --> 00:18:39,519
Excuse me.

424
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,788
Okay.

425
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:42,589
Well, then, looks like
you're stuck with me.

426
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,224
Great, I'm excited.

427
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:48,128
I will e-mail you when
I have something for you to do.

428
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:50,964
Or I could just stop by
a few times a day, check in...?

429
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:52,332
I'll e-mail you.

430
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,768
Also, don't feel like
you have to dress up.

431
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,169
I mean, we're super cas here.

432
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,372
Well, I'm comfortable in a suit,
if it's okay.

433
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:01,175
No, it's fine.

434
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:02,209
Old school.

435
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,276
Exactly.

436
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:04,911
At least I'll stand out.

437
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:07,147
I don't think you need a suit
to do that.

438
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:09,115
True.

439
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:12,552
Well, I think we did it
in less than two minutes.

440
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:14,454
I'll wait to hear from you.

441
00:19:14,455 --> 00:19:15,890
Okay.

442
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:20,393
Want the door open or closed?

443
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:21,763
Doesn't matter.

444
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,100
Open, actually.

445
00:19:27,402 --> 00:19:29,369
You'll get used to me.

446
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,138
Look forward to it.

447
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:45,218
Hi.

448
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:47,021
Hi.

449
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:48,788
Hi.

450
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,424
Hi.

451
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:52,025
Howdy.

452
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:53,460
What do you need?

453
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:55,764
No.

454
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:03,837
What's up, Ben?
Are you good?

455
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,505
Perfect.

456
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:07,074
Okay.

457
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:16,516
The V-Neck back tee?

458
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:17,584
This is Holly.

459
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:18,852
Can you run that up to them?

460
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,721
Yeah, no, no, we love
the whole line, mark.

461
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:22,122
Okay, so you can zoom out.

462
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:23,824
- Like that.
- I'm going to a meeting.

463
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:25,392
I'll be back in an hour.
We'll talk then?

464
00:20:25,393 --> 00:20:27,461
And then you can just
click here to buy it.

465
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:29,729
Cool, yeah.

466
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:41,608
Hello?

467
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:43,009
Hi, yeah.

468
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,778
All right.

469
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:46,313
You staying?

470
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:48,248
Can't leave
before the Boss leaves, Davis.

471
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:50,016
Looks like
you're gonna be here a while.

472
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:52,486
All right.
See you in the morning, Ben.

473
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:53,953
Have a good night.

474
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:56,157
You, too.

475
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,369
Let's make it happen.

476
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:11,105
Thanks.

477
00:21:16,377 --> 00:21:18,011
How about I push, you deliver?

478
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:19,713
Thank you.

479
00:21:19,714 --> 00:21:22,582
I like that there's four faves
instead of three,

480
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,851
but can I see the one
without the jacket just to...

481
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:25,885
Sure.

482
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:27,222
Hi.

483
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:30,323
Okay, so they want to know

484
00:21:30,324 --> 00:21:31,725
what customers bought
who didn't come back

485
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:33,360
so they can spot a problem
if there is one, right?

486
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:34,728
Yeah, but
I don't understand how to...

487
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:36,262
all right, well, here's
what I think we should do.

488
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:37,464
- Ben!
- We should go...

489
00:21:37,465 --> 00:21:39,332
Ben! Hey, look.
Here she comes.

490
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,701
Watch how she won't even...

491
00:21:40,702 --> 00:21:41,801
hey, Beck.
What's up?

492
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:44,439
You look really nice to...

493
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,574
how long can a woman
be mad at you for?

494
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:49,542
Well, it kind of
depends on what you did.

495
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:52,112
Well, first of all,
nothing on purpose.

496
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:53,513
We were going out for a minute.

497
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:56,216
I thought she was cool.
I really liked her.

498
00:21:56,217 --> 00:21:59,353
But then I sort of
accidentally...

499
00:21:59,354 --> 00:22:01,388
- Slept with her roommate.
- That doesn't help.

500
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:02,656
I didn't know
she was her roommate.

501
00:22:02,657 --> 00:22:04,357
I met her out.
How would I know that?

502
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:06,759
- Hey, Nikki.
- Ben, tell me.

503
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,894
I don't know this stuff.

504
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:09,229
You're older.

505
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,763
You've been through a lot.

506
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:13,734
I mean, you... I mean,
you have a lot of experience.

507
00:22:13,735 --> 00:22:15,535
How long do you think
she'll be mad at me for?

508
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:17,371
Jay, I have zero experience
with women,

509
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:19,473
and I can tell you, there's
no coming back from that one.

510
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:21,574
I mean, I assume
you talked to her, apologized,

511
00:22:21,575 --> 00:22:23,577
told her
how much she means to you.

512
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:25,812
Well, you know...

513
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:27,080
You didn't talk to her?

514
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:28,615
What did you do,
send her a tweet?

515
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:29,683
No, of course not.

516
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:32,419
I, like, texted her
a billion times.

517
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,354
She didn't answer,
so then I e-mailed her.

518
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,024
But it was like, a nice e-mail.

519
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:38,659
It was a long one,
well thought out.

520
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,727
Subject line I wrote,
"I'm sooorry,"

521
00:22:40,728 --> 00:22:42,094
with like a ton of o's.

522
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:43,663
So it was like, "I'm sooorry,"

523
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:47,467
with a sad emoticon
where he's crying

524
00:22:47,468 --> 00:22:50,237
at the side of its little cheek.

525
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:53,039
I should probably actually
just talk to her, huh?

526
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,240
Obviously.

527
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:56,376
Can't imagine it would hurt.

528
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:58,478
Oh, did yesterday's numbers
come in?

529
00:22:58,479 --> 00:23:00,113
Yeah.

530
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:01,515
We could do it that way, too.

531
00:23:01,516 --> 00:23:03,783
I noticed my intern
sure keeps busy.

532
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:05,051
Mr. congeniality.

533
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:06,486
He's a very big hit.

534
00:23:06,487 --> 00:23:07,520
Everybody loves him.

535
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:09,288
Okay, do not look at that desk.

536
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:10,490
It's like
the office junk drawer.

537
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:12,893
It's just gonna drive you crazy.

538
00:23:12,894 --> 00:23:14,160
You just did that.

539
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:15,962
What, are you
preparing for surgery?

540
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:19,132
Okay, seriously?

541
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:22,103
Like, how did this even happen?

542
00:23:30,878 --> 00:23:32,178
No, no, I-I can set it up.

543
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:33,579
She's just in a meeting.

544
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,248
Hi.
Something I can help you with?

545
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,250
Yes, Jules spilled soy sauce
on her Saint Laurent jacket.

546
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:38,584
Can you take it
to the photo studio?

547
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:40,153
There's lots of cleaners
and stuff in there.

548
00:23:40,154 --> 00:23:41,154
Sure.
Where is it?

549
00:23:41,155 --> 00:23:42,555
She's wearing it.

550
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:47,894
They would like us
to consider the possibility...

551
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:49,296
Okay.

552
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:54,400
Of, uh, meeting with
some, uh, potential CEOs.

553
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:55,969
Wow.

554
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,839
I did not see that coming.

555
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,143
W-Why? Uh...

556
00:24:03,144 --> 00:24:05,078
Am I too inexperienced
at running a business?

557
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,446
I-I didn't go to Harvard?

558
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:09,316
My... My methods
aren't by the book?

559
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:12,919
I mean,
isn't that how we got here?

560
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,420
Really?

561
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:16,355
I need adult supervision?

562
00:24:16,356 --> 00:24:18,758
Could we be doing better?

563
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:21,728
We hit our five-year goal
in nine months.

564
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:23,096
Exactly.

565
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:25,098
Jules, we can't keep up
with our own success.

566
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,633
You know that.

567
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:29,136
You're an hour late
to every meeting.

568
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:31,371
We have a name for it...
Jules standard time.

569
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:34,106
And look, I get it. There's only
so many hours in the day.

570
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:35,675
We're all playing catchup.

571
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:38,478
Our tech guys work until
2:00, 3:00 in the morning.

572
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:40,513
Customer service is slammed.

573
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:41,915
We're running out of inventory.

574
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:44,817
We've got shipping issues
and programming problems.

575
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,086
And... and the bigger we get,

576
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:47,620
the more complicated
it's gonna get.

577
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:49,789
But isn't this
what a startup is?

578
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,825
What?

579
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:54,026
Say it. What is everyone
so worried about?

580
00:24:54,027 --> 00:24:57,330
That it's all going too fast,
and it could get away from us.

581
00:24:57,331 --> 00:25:00,466
Our investors just think
that a seasoned CEO

582
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:02,435
could take some things
off your plate.

583
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:05,205
That's all. Just free you up
to do what you do great.

584
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:06,573
You come up with the ideas,

585
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:08,408
and let somebody else
make the trains run on time.

586
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:09,910
But, Cameron, this new person,

587
00:25:09,911 --> 00:25:12,078
they are going to
want to do things their way.

588
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,612
Technically be my Boss.

589
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:16,216
I mean, how can I do what I do

590
00:25:16,217 --> 00:25:18,118
if I have to
report to someone else,

591
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,287
run every idea I have
by this person?

592
00:25:20,288 --> 00:25:21,654
Can you see that working?

593
00:25:21,655 --> 00:25:23,923
Well,
gilt groupe brought in a CEO.

594
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:25,693
How are they doing?

595
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:30,663
I mean, get me CEO lessons,
you know?

596
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:34,935
Uh, excuse me.

597
00:25:34,936 --> 00:25:36,702
I apologize,

598
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:39,705
but Becky said you needed
something taken care of

599
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:41,607
on your jacket.

600
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:43,644
Oh, right.

601
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,921
Thank you, Ben.

602
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:56,591
Of course.

603
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,329
The V.C.S made up a list
of potential CEOs.

604
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,197
Let's just take a look
at the list.

605
00:26:04,198 --> 00:26:06,933
Explore it, then decide.

606
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:08,669
Baby steps.

607
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:14,207
Ben.

608
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,875
Something big going on in there?

609
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:17,177
I couldn't say.

610
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:18,878
You were in there a long time.

611
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:20,647
I can't hear a thing.

612
00:26:20,648 --> 00:26:22,582
Psst!

613
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,450
Say something about me to her.

614
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:27,188
No, you have to do it.

615
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,857
On my way, Boss.

616
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:33,226
Hmm. Boss.

617
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:50,744
Hey, Ben. Ben.

618
00:26:50,745 --> 00:26:52,345
How old's that briefcase?

619
00:26:52,346 --> 00:26:55,448
It's a 1973 executive ashburn
attaché.

620
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,116
They don't make it anymore.

621
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:58,618
I'm a little in love with it.

622
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,922
It's a classic, Lewis.
It's unbeatable.

623
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:05,491
Good night.

624
00:27:05,492 --> 00:27:06,827
Bye.

625
00:27:27,114 --> 00:27:30,516
Oh, my God.
Somebody cleaned up that desk.

626
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:34,954
I swear, I was gonna stay late
and do this myself.

627
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:36,589
Wasn't me.

628
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,025
Ben came in at 7:00 this morning
and did it.

629
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:40,559
Who?

630
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,628
Ben.

631
00:27:41,629 --> 00:27:43,396
Your intern.

632
00:27:43,397 --> 00:27:45,598
Ben Whittaker.

633
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,335
Someone's very happy.

634
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:50,537
Brilliant.
Thank you.

635
00:27:50,538 --> 00:27:52,840
Best thing that's happened
around here all week.

636
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:04,352
Thank you.

637
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:11,690
This is your gift
for a job well done.

638
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:15,327
I'm Fiona, the house masseuse.

639
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:16,863
Hi, Fiona.

640
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:17,765
- Hi.
- Ben.

641
00:28:17,766 --> 00:28:19,332
Hi.
Does that feel okay?

642
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,800
It feels great, actually.
Thank you.

643
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:22,969
Okay. You're a little bit tight,
Ben.

644
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,570
Well, I haven't sat at a desk
for a while.

645
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:26,839
- My body's not used to it.
- No, I get it.

646
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,142
Plus, they say
sitting is the new smoking.

647
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:31,711
Let me see what I can do.

648
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:34,213
I, uh, spotted you
in the lunchroom.

649
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,482
I wondered who you were.

650
00:28:35,483 --> 00:28:36,750
- Did you? Oh.
- Yeah.

651
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,718
Then someone told me
you were an intern.

652
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:40,719
That's pretty cool of you
to do this.

653
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,622
Well, it's a brave new world.
Thought I'd jump in.

654
00:28:42,623 --> 00:28:43,756
See what it's all about.

655
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:46,559
Yeah, I know.
Absolutely.

656
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,562
I'm constantly amazed
at what they do here.

657
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,263
Love being a part of it.

658
00:28:51,264 --> 00:28:52,698
Oh.

659
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:54,467
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

660
00:28:54,468 --> 00:28:57,369
There. Yeah.
Right there.

661
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,371
How's that, Ben?

662
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:02,008
Well, it's... oh, boy.

663
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:03,443
Good.

664
00:29:03,444 --> 00:29:05,778
Jason.

665
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:08,482
Okay, good.
Good, good.

666
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,951
There, good.

667
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:14,187
Here you go.

668
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:16,088
A little tight right here.

669
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,256
Is that better?

670
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:19,325
- Oh, boy, oh, boy.
- Oh, how's that?

671
00:29:19,326 --> 00:29:21,694
Oh, boy.

672
00:29:21,695 --> 00:29:23,929
Well, it was nice to meet you,
Ben.

673
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,566
Love that there's another
oldie but goodie here.

674
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:28,201
Nice to meet you.

675
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:29,235
See you later?

676
00:29:29,236 --> 00:29:30,269
Love to.

677
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,839
Me, too.

678
00:29:37,511 --> 00:29:39,278
You're not as old
as I thought you were.

679
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,781
Ooh!

680
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:45,118
Wait, so you're saying
you shave every day?

681
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,552
- Yes.
- Even on Sundays?

682
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:49,088
- Every day.
- Okay, and even if you know

683
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:50,756
that you're not gonna see
anyone that you know?

684
00:29:50,757 --> 00:29:53,226
- Yes.
- How is this possible?

685
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:54,761
I'm on
Cheapapartments.com,

686
00:29:54,762 --> 00:29:57,363
and I literally can't afford
a single apartment

687
00:29:57,364 --> 00:29:58,798
in all of Brooklyn.

688
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,600
My parents gave me two weeks
to find a place,

689
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:03,603
and that's just not
gonna happen.

690
00:30:03,604 --> 00:30:04,871
Getting evicted?

691
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:07,506
Hey, I'm in no rush,
but apparently they are.

692
00:30:07,507 --> 00:30:10,910
All right, here.
Let me see your phone.

693
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:13,446
Cheapapartments.com.
Have you tried Craigslist?

694
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:16,717
- Yes.
- Okay. Then I am out of ideas.

695
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:26,926
Jules. Hi.
How are you?

696
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:28,696
Hi. How are you?

697
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:37,603
- Hey.
- Hey.

698
00:30:37,604 --> 00:30:39,339
- How's it going?
- Well, good.

699
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,507
- Mike, right?
- Yeah.

700
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:43,242
Yeah, I'm Ben.
I work for Jules.

701
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:45,012
- Yeah, she'll be down in a minute.
- I know.

702
00:30:45,013 --> 00:30:46,813
Look, I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable,

703
00:30:46,814 --> 00:30:48,748
but I just happen to have
looked out the window,

704
00:30:48,749 --> 00:30:50,350
and it appeared
you were drinking something

705
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:52,085
from a paper bag.

706
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:54,455
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

707
00:30:55,723 --> 00:30:57,756
Why don't you tell her
you can't drive her today,

708
00:30:57,757 --> 00:30:59,660
or I'm gonna have to.

709
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,931
We all good?

710
00:31:04,932 --> 00:31:06,467
Yeah.

711
00:31:15,575 --> 00:31:17,944
Jules, I'm sorry to do this,

712
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:20,579
but I'm actually
not feeling so hot.

713
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,848
Not sure I should be driving.

714
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:23,048
I wouldn't want to
give you anything.

715
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,150
Oh, sure.

716
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:25,517
Yeah, no, you should
take the day off

717
00:31:25,518 --> 00:31:26,919
and feel better, okay?

718
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,622
Thanks.

719
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:33,059
I'm happy to cover for Mike.

720
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,094
That's okay.
Becky can drive me.

721
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:37,465
Really?
You want to give her more to do?

722
00:31:42,036 --> 00:31:44,269
I hope you don't mind
if I don't get in the front.

723
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,773
I-I'm not trying to be rude.
I just think better in the back.

724
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:47,907
I mean, I could
get in the front, but...

725
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:50,042
no, no, no.
This is perfect.

726
00:31:50,043 --> 00:31:51,143
Yeah.

727
00:31:54,214 --> 00:31:56,816
And everything you hear in the
car is strictly confidential.

728
00:31:56,817 --> 00:31:58,718
- Okay?
- Goes without saying.

729
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:00,753
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh, I found you.

730
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:03,188
Yeah. So, what's up?
How's everything?

731
00:32:03,189 --> 00:32:05,124
Well, your Dad and I
are finally putting together

732
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:06,959
all our research
at the hospital.

733
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,195
That's great.

734
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:10,529
I hear you typing.

735
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,864
That's better.

736
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:13,666
So, we've been studying
women under 40

737
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:15,668
who sleep less than
six hours a night.

738
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:17,970
- And what'd you find out?
- It's interesting.

739
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:20,039
It seems like
they're 38% more likely

740
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,774
to experience major weight gain

741
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:24,210
compared to women who slept
seven hours a night.

742
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:25,544
Are you kidding me?

743
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:27,113
You know I haven't slept
in two years.

744
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:29,348
Well, I can't change
the facts, dear.

745
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:32,418
Mom, you know what? I'm rushing into the
city for a meeting and I need to prepare.

746
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:34,319
Can I call you when I get home?

747
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,121
Oh, you don't have to.

748
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:37,890
Okay. Love you.

749
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:39,760
Thank you.

750
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:45,131
Hey, how we doing?

751
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:47,266
Did you look over
the material on Atwood?

752
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:48,701
Yeah, I did.

753
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:51,370
Uh, he had a great run at
Travelocity and Citigroup...

754
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:52,805
And I get it.
He's major.

755
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,873
He is.
And the best thing about him

756
00:32:54,874 --> 00:32:57,644
is he's been watching us,
and he loves what we're doing.

757
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:58,978
But he's only one of the names
on the list.

758
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,746
So if you don't like him,
we move on.

759
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:03,616
But, Jules, try to be open.

760
00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:04,783
He's supposed to be brilliant.

761
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:06,953
And the V.C.S love him.
A lot.

762
00:33:06,954 --> 00:33:09,155
Mark Zuckerberg
never brought in a CEO,

763
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:10,756
and he was a teenager.

764
00:33:10,757 --> 00:33:12,358
Call me after.

765
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,562
Okay.

766
00:33:15,862 --> 00:33:17,797
Oh, thanks,
but you don't have to.

767
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:19,398
- I can open the door.
- Sure.

768
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:21,901
Okay, so, this shouldn't
take more than an hour.

769
00:33:21,902 --> 00:33:23,202
But if you can't stay here,

770
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:25,004
I'll call Becky
and then she'll find you.

771
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:26,305
And then you can just pull up...

772
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:28,508
don't worry.
I'll be here.

773
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,910
I think I forgot to eat today.

774
00:33:30,911 --> 00:33:32,878
Should I pick you up some sushi?

775
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:35,048
No, I eat too much mercury.

776
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:36,749
I'll be fine.
I'm good.

777
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,584
I'm actually kind of nauseous,
so...

778
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:12,818
That was fast.

779
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:14,287
Not fast enough.

780
00:34:14,288 --> 00:34:17,156
Oh, I-I picked you up some soup
from a place I know.

781
00:34:17,157 --> 00:34:18,190
Thanks.

782
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:21,494
You really didn't have to d...
to do...

783
00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:23,462
oh, my God, that smells so good.

784
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:24,798
Good.

785
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,269
Word travels fast.

786
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,470
Pretty short meeting.

787
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:33,606
- Yeah. I hated him.
- Really? What happened?

788
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:36,709
I thought he was a condescending,
sexist know-it-all

789
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,877
who did not seem to get
what we do at all.

790
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:41,213
And, honestly, I think
he would run our business

791
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:43,382
in a completely inorganic way
that would lose us

792
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:46,219
all the customers
we have killed ourselves to get.

793
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,254
Oh, and I think
that he would replace us

794
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:49,788
as soon as he got the chance.

795
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:50,990
Oh, and...

796
00:34:50,991 --> 00:34:53,993
The man never blinked.

797
00:34:53,994 --> 00:34:56,229
An olympian non-blinker.

798
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,097
Okay, then.

799
00:34:58,098 --> 00:34:59,364
Yeah.

800
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:01,533
See you in the A.M.?

801
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:04,470
Be there or be square.

802
00:35:04,471 --> 00:35:05,838
I'm sorry.

803
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,074
Hey, don't be.

804
00:35:30,697 --> 00:35:33,332
I just wanted to say thank you
for helping out with Mike today

805
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,034
and for getting me chicken soup.

806
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:38,504
Oh, and for cleaning that mess.
That was awesome.

807
00:35:38,505 --> 00:35:39,805
Seriously.

808
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,775
You're very welcome.

809
00:35:43,944 --> 00:35:46,512
It's okay.
I really won't bite.

810
00:35:46,513 --> 00:35:50,249
You started this business all by
yourself a year and a half ago,

811
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,718
and now you have
a staff of 220 people.

812
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,519
Remember who did that.

813
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,688
Who?

814
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,858
Um, thank you.

815
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:03,063
And I hate to say it,
but try to get some sleep.

816
00:36:05,965 --> 00:36:07,800
- Mommy.
- Hey!

817
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:08,901
Hi.

818
00:36:08,902 --> 00:36:11,437
- Hi.
- Here's my favorite girl.

819
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:14,440
Hey, baby.

820
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:15,976
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

821
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:19,146
Over the hump.

822
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:22,681
So, how was your day?

823
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:24,316
Kind of okay.
But you know what?

824
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:27,286
Maddie said she didn't want to
be my friend anymore.

825
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:28,454
Oh.

826
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:30,189
You know what?
I don't think she meant it.

827
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,057
She'd miss you too much.

828
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:35,894
I'm starting to think
that Maddie is bipolar.

829
00:36:35,895 --> 00:36:38,297
We go through this
every other day.

830
00:36:38,298 --> 00:36:39,398
We do.

831
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,834
Oh, how was your meeting?
It was today, right?

832
00:36:41,835 --> 00:36:43,502
Yeah, just had it.

833
00:36:43,503 --> 00:36:45,871
Mommy, I think I'm winning.
Look!

834
00:36:45,872 --> 00:36:47,840
Oh, that is so cool.

835
00:36:47,841 --> 00:36:50,143
Yeah, that's
the play-doh cake challenge.

836
00:36:50,144 --> 00:36:51,810
We're not finishing
until tomorrow,

837
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:54,046
so please hold on all judging.

838
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:56,482
Not to mention that we had
an accident with mine

839
00:36:56,483 --> 00:37:00,052
when someone, not to name
any names, put her elbow in it.

840
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,220
- What?
- It was an accident.

841
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:05,157
Well, I got to say,
I love the pink one a lot.

842
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:07,459
That's mine.
Are you happy at me?

843
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,996
I am so happy at you.
I'm beyond happy at you.

844
00:37:10,997 --> 00:37:12,998
Daddy helped me with the icing.

845
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:14,500
Good job, you guys.

846
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:16,268
So, how about
I give you your bath, okay?

847
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:17,769
Wait, hang on.
I was waiting for your call.

848
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,838
So, you didn't like the guy?

849
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,174
He wasn't a good fit for me.

850
00:37:22,175 --> 00:37:25,544
But a lot of other names
on the list, so...

851
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:26,679
Yeah.

852
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,514
I'm gonna beat you upstairs.

853
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,858
Ben, I haven't seen you in days.

854
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:40,993
That's right, homey.
Ben's got a job.

855
00:37:40,994 --> 00:37:43,028
Oh, you're never home.

856
00:37:43,029 --> 00:37:46,332
What do you do...
never mind. It's Patty.

857
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,850
Hello?

858
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:06,518
Hi, uh, Fiona.

859
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:08,988
It's Ben Whittaker
from about the fit.

860
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:11,757
Oh, hey.
It's good to hear your voice.

861
00:38:11,758 --> 00:38:13,359
Oh, it's good
to hear your voice, too.

862
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,561
It was great meeting you today.

863
00:38:15,562 --> 00:38:18,030
I called you quicker
than you thought I would.

864
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:20,067
I'm glad you did.

865
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:31,677
Jules.

866
00:38:31,678 --> 00:38:34,613
Shh.
Let her sleep, Dad.

867
00:38:34,614 --> 00:38:36,682
Okay.

868
00:38:36,683 --> 00:38:39,453
Okay.

869
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,090
When I heard that,
I was like, "good,

870
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:47,759
because I definitely wasn't
eating lunchables before."

871
00:38:50,263 --> 00:38:52,131
Yeah, they're coming out with

872
00:38:52,132 --> 00:38:53,966
a more grown-up version
of lunchables.

873
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,368
Uh, they're called
so you still can't cook-ables.

874
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:59,972
Uh, grow-up-ables already.

875
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,415
I tried to stay up.

876
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,050
I know.

877
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:14,086
I'm sorry I fell asleep in there.
I just passed out.

878
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:17,255
I know we had a plan to have
a grown-up conversation.

879
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:20,260
You want to Netflix something?

880
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:28,266
Hm?

881
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:30,902
I'm sorry.
I just fell out for a second.

882
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:33,138
It's okay.

883
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:35,708
Paige learned to say
"humongous" today.

884
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:36,875
Really?

885
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,310
Cracks me up.

886
00:39:38,311 --> 00:39:40,346
She looks at me, she says,

887
00:39:40,347 --> 00:39:43,882
"you're a very humongous Dad,
Dad."

888
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:44,883
Oh.

889
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:50,756
Oh, God. You know I hate
to sound like the other Moms.

890
00:39:50,757 --> 00:39:53,625
But I'm starting to feel like
I need a little me time.

891
00:39:53,626 --> 00:39:56,396
I know.

892
00:40:03,437 --> 00:40:04,972
Good night.

893
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:14,012
Anybody home?

894
00:40:14,013 --> 00:40:17,015
Can't keep my eyes open, Jule.

895
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:18,618
We'll do it tomorrow, okay?

896
00:40:33,132 --> 00:40:35,235
Can you turn out your light?

897
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:53,520
Hello?

898
00:40:53,521 --> 00:40:55,120
Hey, Ben.
It's Becky.

899
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:56,489
From Jules' office?

900
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,956
Yeah, hey.
What's up?

901
00:40:57,957 --> 00:40:59,191
Jules' driver is M.I.A.

902
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:00,426
He's not answering
any of my texts.

903
00:41:00,427 --> 00:41:02,194
I know
you drove Jules yesterday,

904
00:41:02,195 --> 00:41:03,562
and I didn't hear
any complaints.

905
00:41:03,563 --> 00:41:05,097
So can you pick her up
this morning?

906
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:07,233
- Sure.
- You know where she lives?

907
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:10,069
- I was there yesterday.
- Okay, so you remember.

908
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,870
- Yeah.
- And you're hearing me, right?

909
00:41:11,871 --> 00:41:13,472
Loud and clear, Boss.

910
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:15,907
Okay, so be there at 7:45,
ring the bell, and walk away.

911
00:41:15,908 --> 00:41:17,009
She'll know it's you.

912
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,678
Ring bell, walk away.
Got it.

913
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:26,386
Oh, walk away.

914
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:29,388
Hang on.
I'm coming.

915
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:30,756
Hi. Here for Jules?

916
00:41:30,757 --> 00:41:32,458
Yeah, hi, sorry.
I'll wait in the car.

917
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:34,893
Uh, she's on a call.
Do you want to come in?

918
00:41:34,894 --> 00:41:36,261
I just made some coffee.

919
00:41:36,262 --> 00:41:37,596
Could be a while.

920
00:41:37,597 --> 00:41:38,765
I'm Matt.

921
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:41,534
Ben Whittaker.

922
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:43,235
Good to meet you.
Come on in.

923
00:41:43,236 --> 00:41:45,738
Legos everywhere,
so watch your step.

924
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:46,972
Sure.

925
00:41:46,973 --> 00:41:49,742
Maybe feature some
bloggers on the homepage?

926
00:41:49,743 --> 00:41:51,444
Have a seat, Ben.

927
00:41:51,445 --> 00:41:53,378
Hey, Paige, this is Ben.
He works with Mommy.

928
00:41:53,379 --> 00:41:54,613
- Hi.
- Hi.

929
00:41:54,614 --> 00:41:56,448
I'm playing
Princess Memory game.

930
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:59,151
Oh, yeah.
Looks like you're about to win.

931
00:41:59,152 --> 00:42:00,586
So, your Jules' new driver?

932
00:42:00,587 --> 00:42:02,888
No, actually, I'm her intern.

933
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:05,123
That's hysterical.

934
00:42:05,124 --> 00:42:07,194
- You know what an intern is?
- No.

935
00:42:07,195 --> 00:42:09,028
That's okay.
Everyone thinks it's hysterical.

936
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:11,830
Hey, Matt, did a...

937
00:42:11,831 --> 00:42:13,632
morning.

938
00:42:13,633 --> 00:42:16,134
Morning.

939
00:42:16,135 --> 00:42:18,270
Is that all dry-cleaning?

940
00:42:18,271 --> 00:42:20,506
These three are.
These two are laundry.

941
00:42:20,507 --> 00:42:23,041
And this button...
this button is missing.

942
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:24,509
I mean, it's loose, so...

943
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,544
- Okay.
- If they could just...

944
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:26,845
- You got it.
- Thanks.

945
00:42:26,846 --> 00:42:28,280
Hey, and, honey,
uh, before you leave,

946
00:42:28,281 --> 00:42:29,615
just got to
go over a couple things.

947
00:42:29,616 --> 00:42:30,682
Okay.

948
00:42:30,683 --> 00:42:33,152
- Look who I found.
- Yay!

949
00:42:33,153 --> 00:42:35,454
- He was in your hamper.
- Thank you.

950
00:42:35,455 --> 00:42:37,188
Matty,
did an ATF box arrive for me?

951
00:42:37,189 --> 00:42:38,590
On the table.

952
00:42:38,591 --> 00:42:40,592
Uh, I... I think
I'll just wait... wait out...

953
00:42:40,593 --> 00:42:43,929
Ben.
Do you want a raisin?

954
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,598
Thank you.

955
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,400
Okay, so tonight,
you're working...

956
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:50,502
Are you listening,
or did I lose you?

957
00:42:50,503 --> 00:42:51,570
Ben, is she listening?

958
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:53,038
I am totally listening.

959
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:55,407
I ordered some stuff
to check on how it arrived.

960
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:57,409
Not great, by the way.

961
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,610
Go on.
Tonight?

962
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:00,412
Yeah, okay.
You're working,

963
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:03,249
so Paige and I are gonna
go to my Mom's for dinner.

964
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,284
After school's
Ruby's birthday party.

965
00:43:05,285 --> 00:43:06,985
And, uh, what about next Monday?

966
00:43:06,986 --> 00:43:09,121
Do you know yet if we can go to
dinner with Robbie and Annie?

967
00:43:09,122 --> 00:43:11,725
Oh, I'm so slammed next week.

968
00:43:12,825 --> 00:43:15,227
I'm sorry.
If you want to go, I'll make it.

969
00:43:15,228 --> 00:43:17,931
- When was it?
- Oh, my God. Monday.

970
00:43:19,465 --> 00:43:22,101
Okay, I'm sorry. I was fixated
on this tissue paper.

971
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:23,502
I will be there.

972
00:43:23,503 --> 00:43:24,869
Okay.

973
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:28,006
Thank you for the coffee.
Thanks for letting me play.

974
00:43:28,007 --> 00:43:29,140
Oh! Sorry.

975
00:43:29,141 --> 00:43:30,442
I'll meet you in the car.

976
00:43:30,443 --> 00:43:32,677
Actually, I have to go.
Come on, sweetie.

977
00:43:32,678 --> 00:43:34,146
Ben, we're gonna
drop Paige at school, okay?

978
00:43:34,147 --> 00:43:35,547
- Here we go.
- Let's do it.

979
00:43:35,548 --> 00:43:38,517
Kiss Daddy goodbye.
Mwah!

980
00:43:38,518 --> 00:43:41,887
Hey, wait.
You forgot your doggy.

981
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,693
Matt seems like a terrific guy.

982
00:43:47,694 --> 00:43:49,079
Hmm?

983
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,462
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

984
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:53,131
Uh, that's okay.
I agree. He is.

985
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:54,633
Who? The Dad?

986
00:43:54,634 --> 00:43:56,735
That's what the other kids
call Matt

987
00:43:56,736 --> 00:43:59,571
because he's the only Dad
in a sea of Moms.

988
00:43:59,572 --> 00:44:01,039
I've read about
these househusbands.

989
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,941
It's interesting
how that all worked just now.

990
00:44:02,942 --> 00:44:06,278
They actually prefer to be
called stay-at-home Dads.

991
00:44:06,279 --> 00:44:08,246
Oh, sorry.
Did not know that.

992
00:44:08,247 --> 00:44:10,215
Well, it's very admirable.

993
00:44:10,216 --> 00:44:12,184
He's a real 21st-century father.

994
00:44:12,185 --> 00:44:13,485
He is.

995
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:15,420
He actually
had a great job in marketing,

996
00:44:15,421 --> 00:44:17,456
but, um,
when about the fit took off,

997
00:44:17,457 --> 00:44:20,125
he left to be a full-time Dad.

998
00:44:20,126 --> 00:44:22,729
Totally saved our butts.

999
00:44:35,475 --> 00:44:37,408
Oh, we're here, big girl.

1000
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:39,811
I do this in the cafeteria

1001
00:44:39,812 --> 00:44:43,148
to my lunch friends
when they're don't looking.

1002
00:44:43,149 --> 00:44:44,750
- You do that?
- Hey, Jules.

1003
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:46,851
Hi.
Nice to see you here.

1004
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:48,454
Uh, not sure
if you got our e-mail,

1005
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:50,155
but we're doing a fiesta lunch
next Friday,

1006
00:44:50,156 --> 00:44:52,124
and we thought
you could bring the guacamole.

1007
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:55,327
Uh, you probably won't have time
to make it, so you can buy it.

1008
00:44:55,328 --> 00:44:57,095
Which is fine.

1009
00:44:57,096 --> 00:44:58,964
Enough for 18.

1010
00:44:58,965 --> 00:45:00,698
No, I can make it.
It's not a problem.

1011
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:02,801
Great.
Matt can bring it.

1012
00:45:02,802 --> 00:45:03,835
Totally.

1013
00:45:03,836 --> 00:45:05,670
Bye.

1014
00:45:05,671 --> 00:45:08,507
All right.
Have a great day, sweet pea.

1015
00:45:08,508 --> 00:45:09,975
Have fun at Ruby's party, okay?

1016
00:45:09,976 --> 00:45:13,378
Mommy? Do you know how
to make guacamole?

1017
00:45:13,379 --> 00:45:14,946
Yes, I do.
Really well, in fact.

1018
00:45:14,947 --> 00:45:16,748
We're...
we're gonna make it together.

1019
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:18,989
And after that, we'll have
a mother-daughter dance party?

1020
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,356
Hey, Maddie.
What's up?

1021
00:45:26,025 --> 00:45:27,993
Bipolar.

1022
00:45:27,994 --> 00:45:29,461
Oh, my God.

1023
00:45:29,462 --> 00:45:30,696
Come here.

1024
00:45:30,697 --> 00:45:32,130
Oh, I love you, big girl.

1025
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:33,765
I love you, too.

1026
00:45:33,766 --> 00:45:36,267
God.

1027
00:45:36,268 --> 00:45:38,604
Taking the high road
is exhausting.

1028
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:40,473
It's 2015.

1029
00:45:40,476 --> 00:45:42,541
Are we really still critical
of working Moms?

1030
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:45,243
Seriously? Still?

1031
00:45:45,244 --> 00:45:48,580
I'm sorry.
That was all rhetorical.

1032
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:50,148
There's no need to respond.

1033
00:45:50,149 --> 00:45:51,583
Wasn't going to.

1034
00:46:08,835 --> 00:46:10,202
Oh, Ben.

1035
00:46:10,203 --> 00:46:11,603
I want to stop by the warehouse.

1036
00:46:11,604 --> 00:46:13,271
480 Greenpoint.

1037
00:46:13,272 --> 00:46:14,607
Sure.

1038
00:46:15,808 --> 00:46:17,942
No, no, no, no.
You want to make a right.

1039
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:19,878
9th to Hamilton
to the expressway.

1040
00:46:19,879 --> 00:46:23,081
Uh, I think we should take
4th to Flatbush. Much faster.

1041
00:46:23,082 --> 00:46:25,617
I-It won't be.

1042
00:46:25,618 --> 00:46:27,819
By 12 minutes, at least.

1043
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,055
Can I try?

1044
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:33,225
I apologize.

1045
00:46:33,226 --> 00:46:34,960
No need.

1046
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:39,198
Try to line the dots up
the best you can.

1047
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:40,966
And then...

1048
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:42,134
Okay.

1049
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:45,203
If you can,
try to pull this towards you,

1050
00:46:45,204 --> 00:46:46,271
holding it on the outside.

1051
00:46:46,272 --> 00:46:48,608
Good meeting you.

1052
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:54,913
Okay, so then
put that on lightly.

1053
00:46:54,914 --> 00:46:57,050
Put it down with two.
Secure it.

1054
00:46:59,952 --> 00:47:01,520
Our package should feel like
they're getting

1055
00:47:01,521 --> 00:47:03,757
a little gift
that they bought for themselves.

1056
00:47:12,649 --> 00:47:14,399
It's open.

1057
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,467
Ben.

1058
00:47:15,468 --> 00:47:16,969
- Wow.
- Come on in.

1059
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:18,971
- Didn't expect this.
- Yeah.

1060
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:21,640
I like to think of it
as a little bit of paradise.

1061
00:47:21,641 --> 00:47:24,210
- Can I interest you in a back rub?
- Oh, no, thanks.

1062
00:47:24,213 --> 00:47:26,844
I just came by because
I found out I have to work late.

1063
00:47:26,845 --> 00:47:28,814
Oh.
Then no dinner tonight.

1064
00:47:28,815 --> 00:47:31,683
Sorry. I was really
looking forward to it.

1065
00:47:31,684 --> 00:47:33,284
But I'm hoping
we can pick another night.

1066
00:47:33,285 --> 00:47:35,320
Of course.
Come sit down.

1067
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:36,988
Let me have your jacket.

1068
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:38,489
- Oh.
- Just for a minute.

1069
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:40,425
Come on. Relax.

1070
00:47:40,426 --> 00:47:43,161
Okay, how about a foot massage?

1071
00:47:43,162 --> 00:47:44,529
During office hours?

1072
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,765
Yeah, that's kind of the point.

1073
00:47:46,766 --> 00:47:49,434
- May I?
- Well...

1074
00:47:49,435 --> 00:47:51,604
Okay.

1075
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,440
It's already pretty good.

1076
00:47:55,441 --> 00:47:57,408
All I've done
is take off your sock.

1077
00:47:57,409 --> 00:47:59,544
Well,
no one's ever done that better.

1078
00:47:59,545 --> 00:48:01,212
Just relax.

1079
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:02,447
Close your eyes.

1080
00:48:02,448 --> 00:48:04,182
Put your head back.

1081
00:48:04,183 --> 00:48:05,617
Oh.

1082
00:48:05,618 --> 00:48:07,619
So, when would you
like to reschedule?

1083
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,054
Tomorrow?

1084
00:48:09,055 --> 00:48:11,323
Can't tomorrow.
What about Saturday?

1085
00:48:11,324 --> 00:48:12,557
Good.

1086
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:15,327
Oh, God.
This is enormously satisfying.

1087
00:48:15,328 --> 00:48:16,594
What time should I pick you up?

1088
00:48:16,595 --> 00:48:18,763
Noon?
I love daytime dates.

1089
00:48:18,764 --> 00:48:20,765
Lunch, perfect.
It's sooner.

1090
00:48:20,766 --> 00:48:23,134
So, how's it going?
How's Jules?

1091
00:48:23,135 --> 00:48:25,704
I mean, she works on
all cylinders all the time.

1092
00:48:25,705 --> 00:48:28,807
Doesn't stop, doesn't sleep,
never see her eat.

1093
00:48:28,808 --> 00:48:31,276
Maybe it's good that I'm here,
you know?

1094
00:48:31,277 --> 00:48:33,078
I hope I can help her.

1095
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:36,214
I knew
you were gonna be a good guy.

1096
00:48:36,215 --> 00:48:37,684
I knew it.

1097
00:48:39,184 --> 00:48:40,952
Try to relax.

1098
00:48:40,953 --> 00:48:42,386
Oh.

1099
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:43,922
Oh.

1100
00:48:43,923 --> 00:48:44,989
Oh.

1101
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,391
Ooh.

1102
00:48:50,529 --> 00:48:53,233
Oh. Wow.

1103
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,934
Oh, my God.

1104
00:48:55,935 --> 00:48:57,502
I'm sorry! I'm leaving!
I'm leaving!

1105
00:48:57,503 --> 00:48:59,538
Sorry! Don't stop!
I'm leaving.

1106
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:00,939
Oh, my shoe.

1107
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,075
Sorry.

1108
00:49:06,612 --> 00:49:08,013
- So?
- I don't know, kid.

1109
00:49:08,014 --> 00:49:09,581
This lease
doesn't look so hot to me.

1110
00:49:09,582 --> 00:49:12,350
Three-month security deposit.
You must really love this place.

1111
00:49:12,351 --> 00:49:13,819
No, it's horrible.

1112
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,254
But I can get in this week.

1113
00:49:16,255 --> 00:49:18,656
Well, if I were you,
I'd keep looking.

1114
00:49:18,657 --> 00:49:19,958
- Okay.
- Hey, Lewis.

1115
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:22,126
What's up?
I've never seen you so awake.

1116
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:25,096
I was just asked to deliver
this huge order to Tribeca,

1117
00:49:25,097 --> 00:49:26,864
and I think
it's to Jay Z's apartment.

1118
00:49:26,865 --> 00:49:28,499
I'm not kidding.
Look, it says, "S. Carter."

1119
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,802
- I'm a little freaked out.
- I don't know who that is,

1120
00:49:30,803 --> 00:49:32,470
but is this
someone you want to impress?

1121
00:49:32,471 --> 00:49:34,139
This is a genius, Ben.

1122
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,675
Whoa, what if Beyoncé
opens the door?

1123
00:49:35,676 --> 00:49:37,208
Oh, my God.

1124
00:49:37,209 --> 00:49:38,943
Okay, now I know
who you're talking about.

1125
00:49:38,944 --> 00:49:41,546
Well, maybe you should put on
a proper shirt with a collar.

1126
00:49:41,547 --> 00:49:43,315
A collar?
These are hip-hop people.

1127
00:49:43,316 --> 00:49:45,784
Dress to impress, Lewis.
Go to the rack.

1128
00:49:45,785 --> 00:49:47,351
Find a boyfriend shirt
that fits.

1129
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:49,988
Bring the hair down if you can.
Tuck in the shirt.

1130
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:51,823
Why doesn't anybody
tuck anything in anymore?

1131
00:49:51,824 --> 00:49:53,291
Oh, I'm asking you.

1132
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:54,359
Okay, okay.

1133
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,561
Benjamin...

1134
00:49:56,562 --> 00:49:58,096
We made some progress.

1135
00:49:58,097 --> 00:49:59,831
Very big day
for the intern team.

1136
00:49:59,832 --> 00:50:00,965
It was great.

1137
00:50:00,966 --> 00:50:02,200
I mean, she yelled at me, but...

1138
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:03,601
she yells at me
all the time, too.

1139
00:50:03,602 --> 00:50:04,802
Right?
It was communication.

1140
00:50:04,803 --> 00:50:06,104
- Yeah.
- It was a breakthrough.

1141
00:50:06,105 --> 00:50:07,138
Yeah.

1142
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:08,907
Whoo!
Oh, you want one too?

1143
00:50:08,908 --> 00:50:10,408
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1144
00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:13,211
Okay, boys. I'm possibly
meeting Jay Z and/or Beyoncé,

1145
00:50:13,212 --> 00:50:14,245
and I'm in a blouse.

1146
00:50:14,246 --> 00:50:16,581
Wear it, dude.
It's an improvement.

1147
00:50:16,582 --> 00:50:17,582
Not true.

1148
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:19,017
Big one.

1149
00:50:53,118 --> 00:50:55,887
- I hate eating alone.
- So do I.

1150
00:50:55,888 --> 00:50:57,822
You know, you don't actually
have to keep doing that.

1151
00:50:57,823 --> 00:51:00,091
Oh, force of habit.

1152
00:51:00,092 --> 00:51:01,059
Here you go.

1153
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,293
Swiped these
from the tech fridge.

1154
00:51:02,294 --> 00:51:03,662
Oh, nice going.

1155
00:51:03,663 --> 00:51:05,463
You want a slice?

1156
00:51:05,464 --> 00:51:07,367
Sure, thanks.

1157
00:51:09,602 --> 00:51:10,735
Cheers.

1158
00:51:10,736 --> 00:51:12,105
Cheers.

1159
00:51:17,676 --> 00:51:19,777
I noticed a couple hours ago,

1160
00:51:19,778 --> 00:51:22,147
you had a meeting
with another possible CEO.

1161
00:51:22,148 --> 00:51:24,582
I saw him arrive.
How'd that go?

1162
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:26,484
It was going well...

1163
00:51:26,485 --> 00:51:27,919
Until he called us...

1164
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,756
I believe the term he used
was a "chick site."

1165
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:34,292
And I didn't hear
anything he said after that.

1166
00:51:34,293 --> 00:51:37,228
Apparently, selling clothes
makes us a "chick site."

1167
00:51:37,229 --> 00:51:38,362
I mean, really?

1168
00:51:38,363 --> 00:51:39,764
How is this not legit?

1169
00:51:39,765 --> 00:51:42,567
I couldn't agree more.
I find that surprising.

1170
00:51:42,568 --> 00:51:45,071
Really?
Sexism in business?

1171
00:51:47,273 --> 00:51:48,973
So...

1172
00:51:48,974 --> 00:51:51,409
What did you do for work, Ben,
before you retired?

1173
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:53,812
I was a V.P.
For Dex one.

1174
00:51:53,813 --> 00:51:54,946
Phonebooks?

1175
00:51:54,947 --> 00:51:57,015
Yeah.
I was in charge of printing,

1176
00:51:57,016 --> 00:51:59,484
and before that I ran
sales and advertising.

1177
00:51:59,485 --> 00:52:01,287
Big jobs.

1178
00:52:03,255 --> 00:52:05,892
Wasn't this a factory
that used to make phonebooks?

1179
00:52:10,729 --> 00:52:11,796
No. What?

1180
00:52:11,797 --> 00:52:13,832
- Yeah.
- What?

1181
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:16,701
This is where you worked?

1182
00:52:16,702 --> 00:52:19,072
For almost 40 years.

1183
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:22,908
Yeah.

1184
00:52:22,909 --> 00:52:25,677
For twenty-some years
I sat right by that window.

1185
00:52:25,678 --> 00:52:27,779
That was my office.

1186
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,948
It was a few steps up back then.

1187
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:33,718
We'd look out
over the whole factory.

1188
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:35,253
Our printing presses
were in that corner.

1189
00:52:35,254 --> 00:52:37,388
That's why the floor dips
back there.

1190
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:38,890
No way.

1191
00:52:38,891 --> 00:52:40,692
I know everything
about this building.

1192
00:52:40,693 --> 00:52:42,193
Or used to.

1193
00:52:42,194 --> 00:52:44,162
You know the sycamores on
the other side of the building?

1194
00:52:44,163 --> 00:52:45,296
- Yeah.
- The big ones?

1195
00:52:45,297 --> 00:52:46,831
Yeah. The big ones.
I love them.

1196
00:52:46,832 --> 00:52:49,268
Yeah. I remember
the day they were planted.

1197
00:52:51,871 --> 00:52:54,506
Is it totally weird
being back here?

1198
00:52:54,507 --> 00:52:56,040
Well, it feels like home.

1199
00:52:56,041 --> 00:53:00,078
It's... Remodeled, but...

1200
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,314
Home.

1201
00:53:06,151 --> 00:53:08,053
So you're on Facebook, huh?

1202
00:53:08,054 --> 00:53:09,654
Well, I've been trying to
figure it out.

1203
00:53:09,655 --> 00:53:11,022
I joined about 10 minutes ago.

1204
00:53:11,023 --> 00:53:13,458
Well, better late than never.

1205
00:53:13,459 --> 00:53:14,792
You want some help?

1206
00:53:14,793 --> 00:53:17,862
I'd love some, but, really,
you've got better things to do.

1207
00:53:17,863 --> 00:53:20,333
No, I need a diversion.

1208
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,235
You have a photo of yourself?

1209
00:53:23,236 --> 00:53:25,436
- No. I need one?
- If you want to look up

1210
00:53:25,437 --> 00:53:27,739
all those hotties
from high school, you do.

1211
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,007
Say cheese.

1212
00:53:29,008 --> 00:53:30,275
Cheese.

1213
00:53:32,244 --> 00:53:33,310
That's cute.

1214
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,516
Okay,
I just need to send that to you.

1215
00:53:37,516 --> 00:53:39,083
Uh, all right.

1216
00:53:39,084 --> 00:53:40,919
So there are all these questions
for your profile

1217
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,887
that you can answer
if you want to or not.

1218
00:53:42,888 --> 00:53:46,624
Like religious views,
political views...

1219
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:48,660
People who inspire you...

1220
00:53:48,661 --> 00:53:50,962
Jules Ostin.

1221
00:53:50,963 --> 00:53:52,296
I'm not trying to brownnose you,

1222
00:53:52,297 --> 00:53:54,198
but I've been in business
a long time,

1223
00:53:54,199 --> 00:53:57,102
and I've never run across
anyone quite like you.

1224
00:53:57,103 --> 00:53:58,469
You do inspire, Jules.

1225
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:59,971
I just knew,
at the end of the day,

1226
00:53:59,972 --> 00:54:01,473
that a woman
with a glass of wine

1227
00:54:01,474 --> 00:54:03,942
and a laptop
had real shopping potential.

1228
00:54:03,943 --> 00:54:06,745
And if you could actually
promise her things would fit...

1229
00:54:06,746 --> 00:54:07,846
See?
That's what I mean.

1230
00:54:07,847 --> 00:54:09,413
Okay.

1231
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:11,883
Mm.
You have a favorite quote?

1232
00:54:11,884 --> 00:54:13,317
I do.

1233
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:15,353
"You're never wrong
to do the right thing."

1234
00:54:15,354 --> 00:54:17,455
- Who said that, you?
- Yeah.

1235
00:54:17,456 --> 00:54:20,758
But I'm pretty sure
Mark Twain said it first.

1236
00:54:22,861 --> 00:54:24,229
Okay, favorite music?

1237
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:27,365
Uh, geez. Sam Cooke,
one of my all-time favorites.

1238
00:54:27,366 --> 00:54:29,834
Love Miles Davis,
Billie Holiday.

1239
00:54:29,835 --> 00:54:31,503
Oh, she was great, right?

1240
00:54:31,504 --> 00:54:33,672
I mean, she could just, like...

1241
00:54:33,673 --> 00:54:35,842
- Transport you.
- Oh, yeah.

1242
00:54:36,809 --> 00:54:39,143
Okay, books?

1243
00:54:39,144 --> 00:54:41,813
Love Clancy, Ludlum.

1244
00:54:41,814 --> 00:54:43,448
Crazy about
"Harry Potter."

1245
00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:45,683
- Matt loves "Harry Potter," too.
- Oh, yeah?

1246
00:54:45,684 --> 00:54:47,485
Yeah, like, read them all
the week they came out.

1247
00:54:47,486 --> 00:54:51,022
Wow. Me, too.

1248
00:54:51,023 --> 00:54:53,524
Um, okay, what's
your relationship status?

1249
00:54:53,525 --> 00:54:55,827
Are you married?

1250
00:54:55,828 --> 00:54:57,328
Single?

1251
00:54:57,329 --> 00:54:59,897
Widower.

1252
00:54:59,898 --> 00:55:01,968
I'm sorry.

1253
00:55:04,603 --> 00:55:07,672
I think we should just
say single, then?

1254
00:55:07,673 --> 00:55:10,308
Yeah.

1255
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:13,712
Okay, do you know
what you need now?

1256
00:55:13,713 --> 00:55:15,881
You need someone to friend.

1257
00:55:15,882 --> 00:55:17,682
I'll be friends
with the other interns.

1258
00:55:17,683 --> 00:55:19,484
They'll show me how to do it
in the morning.

1259
00:55:19,485 --> 00:55:21,852
Well, you...
you can friend me.

1260
00:55:21,853 --> 00:55:23,454
Okay, thank you.

1261
00:55:23,455 --> 00:55:24,523
Okay.

1262
00:55:27,926 --> 00:55:29,627
Okay.
Congratulations.

1263
00:55:29,628 --> 00:55:32,329
You are now officially part
of the Facebook generation.

1264
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:35,200
Good deal.

1265
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:37,268
- Um, you done?
- Yes, thank you.

1266
00:55:37,269 --> 00:55:38,502
Okay.

1267
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:41,439
Well, I have, uh,
about another hour of work.

1268
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,107
You...
you okay with that?

1269
00:55:43,108 --> 00:55:44,644
Of course.

1270
00:55:45,878 --> 00:55:47,545
This was great, Jules.

1271
00:55:47,546 --> 00:55:49,313
Yeah.

1272
00:55:49,314 --> 00:55:54,085
It was nice to have an adult
conversation with an adult man,

1273
00:55:54,086 --> 00:55:57,388
you know what I mean?
Like, not about work.

1274
00:55:57,389 --> 00:55:59,724
Not about...

1275
00:55:59,725 --> 00:56:01,759
I know what you mean.

1276
00:56:29,187 --> 00:56:31,356
Oh, we're here?

1277
00:56:31,357 --> 00:56:32,457
Yeah.

1278
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:33,392
Was I snoring?

1279
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:35,493
No, no, no.
Just sleeping.

1280
00:56:35,494 --> 00:56:37,429
Sorry.

1281
00:56:37,432 --> 00:56:39,330
My parents
are sleep researchers,

1282
00:56:39,331 --> 00:56:41,232
and they've been studying
my sleep my whole life.

1283
00:56:41,233 --> 00:56:43,935
Apparently,
I'm a classic noisy sleeper.

1284
00:56:43,936 --> 00:56:45,436
Fun getting to know me, huh?

1285
00:56:45,437 --> 00:56:47,473
It is.

1286
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:54,212
I never fall asleep in the car,
so that was actually amazing.

1287
00:56:54,213 --> 00:56:55,646
Apologize for the racket.

1288
00:56:55,647 --> 00:56:57,482
Barely noticed.

1289
00:56:57,483 --> 00:57:00,618
I'll pretend I believe you.

1290
00:57:02,221 --> 00:57:04,355
I love this house.

1291
00:57:04,356 --> 00:57:06,557
It just looks happy to me.

1292
00:57:06,558 --> 00:57:08,426
Like, if it was in a kid's book,

1293
00:57:08,427 --> 00:57:11,962
it would make you feel good when
you turned the page and saw it.

1294
00:57:11,963 --> 00:57:13,398
You know what I mean?

1295
00:57:13,399 --> 00:57:15,833
I do.

1296
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:17,570
Well...

1297
00:57:20,906 --> 00:57:22,540
Sayonara.

1298
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:24,577
Sayonara.

1299
00:57:35,221 --> 00:57:38,823
I didn't hear you come in.

1300
00:57:38,824 --> 00:57:40,858
You know...

1301
00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:44,028
I was thinking...

1302
00:57:44,029 --> 00:57:46,799
We need
some awake time together.

1303
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:01,512
Yeah, that, too.

1304
00:58:26,638 --> 00:58:27,573
Morning.

1305
00:58:27,574 --> 00:58:29,606
Good morning.
I'm Doris.

1306
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:31,208
They asked me
to drive you today.

1307
00:58:31,209 --> 00:58:32,343
Are you all set back there?

1308
00:58:32,344 --> 00:58:33,811
You got your seat belt fastened?

1309
00:58:33,812 --> 00:58:35,314
What happened to Ben?

1310
00:58:35,317 --> 00:58:38,883
Oh, somebody said
that he got transferred.

1311
00:58:38,884 --> 00:58:43,087
Um, you know the best way
to get back to headquarters?

1312
00:58:44,356 --> 00:58:45,556
- Oh!
- Oh, my!

1313
00:58:45,557 --> 00:58:47,059
Oh, what...

1314
00:58:47,062 --> 00:58:50,329
- Come on!
- Hold your horses, maniac!

1315
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:53,798
Which way, Hon?

1316
00:58:53,799 --> 00:58:55,232
- I'm all turned around here.
- Doris.

1317
00:58:55,233 --> 00:58:56,701
- Doris! Doris!
- What? What?!

1318
00:58:56,702 --> 00:58:58,836
You told me to transfer him.

1319
00:58:58,837 --> 00:59:01,605
That was two days ago.
Why didn't you check with me?

1320
00:59:01,606 --> 00:59:03,942
First of all,
that was yesterday.

1321
00:59:03,943 --> 00:59:06,544
Well, where is he?
Do you know?

1322
00:59:11,116 --> 00:59:12,751
Thank you.

1323
00:59:17,455 --> 00:59:20,124
You must think I'm demented.

1324
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:21,458
Not the word I would use,

1325
00:59:21,459 --> 00:59:23,761
but I was a little surprised
when I got the call.

1326
00:59:23,762 --> 00:59:26,931
Jules, I apologize
if I overstepped in some way.

1327
00:59:26,932 --> 00:59:29,133
No. No, no, no.
No, please don't apologize.

1328
00:59:29,134 --> 00:59:30,801
You have done nothing wrong.

1329
00:59:30,802 --> 00:59:34,672
Look, I have a lot going on,
and I'm a very private person.

1330
00:59:34,673 --> 00:59:36,241
And at first, I don't know,
I thought

1331
00:59:36,242 --> 00:59:38,343
maybe this wasn't gonna work,
but I was wrong.

1332
00:59:38,344 --> 00:59:39,911
Let me get one of those.

1333
00:59:39,912 --> 00:59:41,179
- No, no, no.
- No.

1334
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,880
Jules, no explanation necessary.
Please.

1335
00:59:42,881 --> 00:59:47,017
No, actually, one is because
I am usually better than this.

1336
00:59:48,787 --> 00:59:51,522
The truth is...

1337
00:59:51,523 --> 00:59:52,956
Something about you
makes me feel calm

1338
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:57,061
or more centered or something,
and I-I could use that.

1339
00:59:57,062 --> 00:59:59,530
Obviously.

1340
00:59:59,531 --> 01:00:03,267
I hope you'll accept my apology
and come back to work for me.

1341
01:00:03,268 --> 01:00:04,969
If you want.

1342
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,136
And I'm not just saying this

1343
01:00:06,137 --> 01:00:07,404
because
I screwed up this morning.

1344
01:00:07,405 --> 01:00:09,340
But I was thinking that

1345
01:00:09,341 --> 01:00:12,043
I'd like to bring you up to
my area, next to Becky.

1346
01:00:12,044 --> 01:00:15,780
I know you can handle more work.
If you'd like more. I...

1347
01:00:15,781 --> 01:00:17,649
Oh, God, I can't tell you
how much I hate

1348
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:19,017
that I jumped the gun
and I made you feel...

1349
01:00:19,018 --> 01:00:21,652
I'm coming back.
I-I'm happy to come back.

1350
01:00:21,653 --> 01:00:23,454
Excellent.

1351
01:00:23,455 --> 01:00:25,490
Can I give you a lift
back to the office?

1352
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:26,924
Sure, thanks.
Can I take this?

1353
01:00:26,925 --> 01:00:28,726
No.

1354
01:00:30,262 --> 01:00:31,796
Actually, do you mind driving?

1355
01:00:31,797 --> 01:00:34,400
- I don't technically have a license.
- Sure.

1356
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:40,805
This is...
this is crazy, Ben.

1357
01:00:40,806 --> 01:00:42,273
Two desks
are not gonna fit in here.

1358
01:00:42,274 --> 01:00:43,741
No, I promise
I'll stay out of your way.

1359
01:00:43,742 --> 01:00:45,943
But it's impossible because
now I don't have room for...

1360
01:00:45,944 --> 01:00:47,111
- hi.
- Hi.

1361
01:00:47,112 --> 01:00:48,379
This is good, right?

1362
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,880
I like this arrangement.

1363
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:52,349
Uh, Becky, I want you to let Ben
give you a hand, okay?

1364
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:53,718
And CC him on all my e-mails?

1365
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:55,219
Did we get yesterday's numbers?

1366
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:58,857
Uh, yes, we did.
I saw them here...

1367
01:01:01,326 --> 01:01:02,994
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1368
01:01:02,995 --> 01:01:05,295
And I need to go over the data
on customer purchase patterns.

1369
01:01:05,296 --> 01:01:06,697
Let Ben take a look
at that, too.

1370
01:01:06,698 --> 01:01:08,800
Actually, let Ben
take a look at that first.

1371
01:01:08,801 --> 01:01:09,833
Okay.

1372
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:11,802
Don't worry, Becky.
Backup's good.

1373
01:01:11,803 --> 01:01:13,672
Ping me when Cameron gets in?

1374
01:01:29,754 --> 01:01:31,357
Hey.

1375
01:01:32,858 --> 01:01:34,125
Becky?

1376
01:01:34,126 --> 01:01:36,527
I've been here nine months, Ben,
and she's never asked me

1377
01:01:36,528 --> 01:01:39,697
to take a look at anything
for her ever, okay?

1378
01:01:39,698 --> 01:01:41,432
I hear you.
That's frustrating.

1379
01:01:41,433 --> 01:01:43,567
I mean, totally.
I graduated from penn.

1380
01:01:43,568 --> 01:01:45,002
I have a business degree.

1381
01:01:45,003 --> 01:01:47,704
But I never seem to do
anything right around here.

1382
01:01:47,705 --> 01:01:51,709
And you're like 50 years older
than me and you're deaf.

1383
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:54,747
I happen to think you do
a lot of things right.

1384
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:58,950
You do so much.

1385
01:01:58,951 --> 01:02:01,051
I know.
I know that.

1386
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:02,487
- Mm-hmm.
- But she doesn't.

1387
01:02:02,488 --> 01:02:06,490
I mean, I bust my ass for her
14 hours a day,

1388
01:02:06,491 --> 01:02:08,525
and she never notices.

1389
01:02:08,526 --> 01:02:10,761
Oh. Oh, my God.

1390
01:02:10,762 --> 01:02:13,865
I hate girls who cry at work.

1391
01:02:13,866 --> 01:02:16,133
How 'bout if you,
just as an experiment,

1392
01:02:16,134 --> 01:02:17,435
try letting me help you.

1393
01:02:17,436 --> 01:02:18,936
A lot of your stress
is gonna be lifted

1394
01:02:18,937 --> 01:02:20,871
once you're out from under
this mountain of worry.

1395
01:02:20,872 --> 01:02:23,407
And maybe you should consider
leaving here at a normal hour

1396
01:02:23,408 --> 01:02:24,609
once in a while.

1397
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,077
See your friends.
Have a little fun.

1398
01:02:26,078 --> 01:02:29,647
Mm-hmm. I can offer
my assistance in this area.

1399
01:02:29,648 --> 01:02:33,217
I would love to, actually.

1400
01:02:33,218 --> 01:02:37,421
I just don't want her to think
that I can't do my job

1401
01:02:37,422 --> 01:02:39,156
and I need an intern to help me.

1402
01:02:39,157 --> 01:02:41,259
Okay, you're not gonna
want to hear this,

1403
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:44,561
but I heard women who sleep
less than seven hours a night

1404
01:02:44,562 --> 01:02:46,130
gain 38% more weight

1405
01:02:46,131 --> 01:02:48,900
than women who sleep
more than seven hours a night.

1406
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:50,501
What?!

1407
01:02:50,502 --> 01:02:52,136
I leave here at 11:00.
I get back at 7:00.

1408
01:02:52,137 --> 01:02:56,139
I sleep like five hours a night,
and now I'm gonna get fat?

1409
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,442
Let's get through this stuff.
Let's do it together.

1410
01:02:58,443 --> 01:03:00,044
Let's clean-slate it.

1411
01:03:00,045 --> 01:03:01,212
Let's just do it.

1412
01:03:01,213 --> 01:03:03,247
- Yes!
- Very nice, St. Louis.

1413
01:03:03,248 --> 01:03:05,850
- Ah, suede jacket in D.C.
- I cannot believe how well that sweater is doing.

1414
01:03:05,851 --> 01:03:07,184
I'm so happy.

1415
01:03:07,185 --> 01:03:09,887
- Beautiful, Miami! Thank you.
- Oh! Look at Chicago!

1416
01:03:09,888 --> 01:03:11,856
She put the same boots in her
cart as the woman from Houston.

1417
01:03:11,857 --> 01:03:13,758
Okay, let's see
what she does at checkout.

1418
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,060
She's not buying them either.

1419
01:03:17,061 --> 01:03:19,096
Okay, maybe check the
delivery cost on those boots?

1420
01:03:19,097 --> 01:03:20,097
Mm-hmm.

1421
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:22,766
- Knock-knock.
- Hey.

1422
01:03:22,767 --> 01:03:25,269
Hi. I took a look
at the data purchase patterns.

1423
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:26,904
Uh, should I come back?

1424
01:03:26,905 --> 01:03:28,806
No, no, come on in.
That was fast.

1425
01:03:28,807 --> 01:03:30,641
Well, I enlisted Becky's help.

1426
01:03:30,642 --> 01:03:33,377
It seems the most expensive
place you're advertising

1427
01:03:33,378 --> 01:03:36,480
is actually bringing you the customers
who are spending the least.

1428
01:03:36,481 --> 01:03:38,549
And the channels
you're least investing in

1429
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:41,852
are adding enormous value in segments
that currently appear to have low value

1430
01:03:41,853 --> 01:03:44,888
but actually have
the highest spending potential.

1431
01:03:44,889 --> 01:03:48,191
That's what I could tell so far.

1432
01:03:48,192 --> 01:03:50,728
Oh, Ben. Can you, like,
deal with that for me?

1433
01:03:50,729 --> 01:03:51,895
Maybe come up with
a better plan?

1434
01:03:51,896 --> 01:03:53,464
I mean, if you have the time?

1435
01:03:53,465 --> 01:03:55,000
Happy to.

1436
01:03:55,967 --> 01:03:58,168
The man spent 40 years
in business.

1437
01:03:58,169 --> 01:03:59,403
Yeah, no, I get it.

1438
01:03:59,404 --> 01:04:01,171
And, Jules, Becky
was a huge help in this.

1439
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:03,240
You know she has
a business degree from PENN?

1440
01:04:03,241 --> 01:04:04,641
I know.

1441
01:04:04,642 --> 01:04:07,446
I mean, I forgot, but I know.

1442
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:13,684
I'll say something to her.

1443
01:04:13,685 --> 01:04:15,219
That would be very nice.

1444
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:17,889
Hey. How's it goin' up here
in first-class?

1445
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:20,324
Busy. I see
you found an apartment.

1446
01:04:20,325 --> 01:04:21,425
No.

1447
01:04:21,426 --> 01:04:22,627
My two weeks are up.

1448
01:04:22,628 --> 01:04:24,094
I'm movin' in with my cousin.

1449
01:04:24,095 --> 01:04:25,063
Excellent.

1450
01:04:25,064 --> 01:04:26,496
In Philadelphia.

1451
01:04:26,497 --> 01:04:27,731
- Davis.
- What?

1452
01:04:27,732 --> 01:04:29,667
I'll get there by 11:00,
leave at 5:00.

1453
01:04:29,668 --> 01:04:31,201
It's cool.
I can handle it.

1454
01:04:31,202 --> 01:04:34,338
You know, I feel like
everybody's uncle around here.

1455
01:04:34,339 --> 01:04:35,539
Yeah, why is that?

1456
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,808
Because I'm gonna save your ass,

1457
01:04:36,809 --> 01:04:38,876
and I'm gonna put you up
for a few weeks.

1458
01:04:38,877 --> 01:04:39,677
Obviously.

1459
01:04:39,678 --> 01:04:41,078
Ben, thank you.

1460
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:42,780
Mwah!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1461
01:04:42,781 --> 01:04:44,883
Okay. Okay.
Easy, fella.

1462
01:04:48,053 --> 01:04:50,321
I like that you do
the throw pillow thing.

1463
01:04:50,322 --> 01:04:52,523
I was married
for a very long time.

1464
01:04:52,524 --> 01:04:54,591
Mm.

1465
01:04:54,592 --> 01:04:57,627
Whoa.
Is this your closet?

1466
01:04:57,628 --> 01:05:00,531
Busy man about town.

1467
01:05:00,532 --> 01:05:02,099
What's in all these drawers?

1468
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:05,135
Boxers, t-shirts,
pocket squares, handkerchiefs.

1469
01:05:05,136 --> 01:05:07,071
Okay, what's the deal
with the handkerchief?

1470
01:05:07,072 --> 01:05:08,672
That one
I just don't get at all.

1471
01:05:08,673 --> 01:05:10,041
Okay. It's essential.

1472
01:05:10,042 --> 01:05:12,342
That your generation
doesn't know that is criminal.

1473
01:05:12,343 --> 01:05:15,312
The best reason to carry
a handkerchief is to lend it.

1474
01:05:15,313 --> 01:05:17,114
Ask Jason about this.

1475
01:05:17,115 --> 01:05:18,416
Women cry, Davis.

1476
01:05:18,417 --> 01:05:19,750
We carry it for them.

1477
01:05:19,751 --> 01:05:22,185
One of the last vestiges
of the Chivalrous Gent.

1478
01:05:22,186 --> 01:05:24,054
Oh. Well, then
it's different than a po...

1479
01:05:24,055 --> 01:05:25,623
I know you want to hang,
but I...

1480
01:05:25,624 --> 01:05:28,091
I have to get some sleep, kid.
I'm pooped.

1481
01:05:28,092 --> 01:05:29,261
Good night, Ben.

1482
01:05:30,561 --> 01:05:32,130
Thanks again.

1483
01:05:33,965 --> 01:05:36,867
Will you wake me in the morning
or is that too much to ask?

1484
01:05:36,868 --> 01:05:38,736
- My parents always...
- too much.

1485
01:05:38,737 --> 01:05:41,272
Understood. I'll just
set an alarm on my phone.

1486
01:05:41,273 --> 01:05:44,008
I hope I can hear it.
I'm such a deep sleeper.

1487
01:05:44,009 --> 01:05:46,009
Oh, my God.
I'll wake you.

1488
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:47,311
Thank you!

1489
01:05:47,312 --> 01:05:49,646
Love you!
Not kidding!

1490
01:05:49,647 --> 01:05:52,516
I love you, too.
Now go to bed.

1491
01:05:52,517 --> 01:05:54,585
Here's some more berries, guys.

1492
01:05:54,586 --> 01:05:57,321
Ben, can you pour me
more syrup, please?

1493
01:05:57,322 --> 01:05:58,655
Sure can.

1494
01:05:58,656 --> 01:06:00,524
There you go.

1495
01:06:00,525 --> 01:06:01,993
Perfect.
Good job.

1496
01:06:01,994 --> 01:06:03,394
Oh, thanks.

1497
01:06:03,395 --> 01:06:07,798
Oh, boy. Okay, so, this really
big CEO named Townsend,

1498
01:06:07,799 --> 01:06:09,199
the one everyone said would
never be interested in us

1499
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,801
because we weren't
big enough for him?

1500
01:06:10,802 --> 01:06:12,169
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

1501
01:06:13,738 --> 01:06:16,340
We're like your sister wives.

1502
01:06:16,341 --> 01:06:19,476
Well, we just found out
he's beyond interested.

1503
01:06:19,477 --> 01:06:21,212
Exciting.

1504
01:06:21,213 --> 01:06:23,047
Yeah.

1505
01:06:23,048 --> 01:06:24,114
Maybe.

1506
01:06:24,115 --> 01:06:25,716
Everyone's flipping out
about it,

1507
01:06:25,717 --> 01:06:27,752
but you know
I'm still on the fence at best.

1508
01:06:27,753 --> 01:06:29,120
Anyway, the only thing is,

1509
01:06:29,121 --> 01:06:30,721
I have to go to San Francisco
to meet him.

1510
01:06:30,722 --> 01:06:33,056
- He can't come here.
- When do you have to go?

1511
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:35,559
The only day he can meet
is next Thursday.

1512
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,927
Do you want to come?

1513
01:06:36,928 --> 01:06:38,629
Maybe we can stay the weekend?

1514
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:41,866
Oh, that sounds awesome.
Um...

1515
01:06:41,867 --> 01:06:44,435
Oh, Thursday I can't.

1516
01:06:44,436 --> 01:06:46,070
Paige is snack leader at school,

1517
01:06:46,071 --> 01:06:47,737
and I'm supposed to be
in the class with her.

1518
01:06:47,738 --> 01:06:49,573
- It's kind of a big deal.
- Right.

1519
01:06:49,574 --> 01:06:51,341
Yeah, it's a really big deal.

1520
01:06:51,342 --> 01:06:53,177
No, I know, sweetie.
I'm sorry. I forgot.

1521
01:06:53,178 --> 01:06:56,080
Uh, maybe Ben could go with you.

1522
01:06:56,081 --> 01:06:58,982
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1523
01:06:58,983 --> 01:07:00,884
Guys, Ben has a life.

1524
01:07:00,885 --> 01:07:02,252
Uh, not really.

1525
01:07:02,253 --> 01:07:04,021
Not one that takes me
to San Francisco.

1526
01:07:04,022 --> 01:07:06,357
If you want the company,
I'd love to go.

1527
01:07:06,358 --> 01:07:07,425
Really?

1528
01:07:07,426 --> 01:07:09,694
Definitely.

1529
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,995
- Guess what, Ben?
- Yes?

1530
01:07:10,996 --> 01:07:13,197
Today, my Dad's gonna be Ariel.

1531
01:07:13,198 --> 01:07:14,298
It's his turn.

1532
01:07:14,299 --> 01:07:17,034
- Oh, that's good, right?
- Really good.

1533
01:07:17,035 --> 01:07:19,136
You guys think
finding a CEO is a big deal?

1534
01:07:19,137 --> 01:07:22,206
Here, the big negotiation
is who gets to be Ariel

1535
01:07:22,207 --> 01:07:24,274
when we're playing
"Little Mermaid."

1536
01:07:24,275 --> 01:07:26,443
And for the record,
it's never been my turn.

1537
01:07:26,444 --> 01:07:27,578
Mnh-mnh.

1538
01:07:27,579 --> 01:07:29,179
So this is huge for me.
I'm excited.

1539
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:31,817
I get to comb my hair with a fork...

1540
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:34,118
play with Gadgets and Gizmos aplenty.

1541
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:35,853
Daddy!

1542
01:07:35,854 --> 01:07:37,220
This is Jules.

1543
01:07:37,221 --> 01:07:39,023
So, guys, how long
till we get it fixed?

1544
01:07:39,024 --> 01:07:41,592
I mean, if you can't zoom in,
you probably won't buy.

1545
01:07:41,593 --> 01:07:44,461
Yeah, the first couple
hours are already down 23%.

1546
01:07:44,462 --> 01:07:45,830
- Oh, boy.
- Okay.

1547
01:07:45,831 --> 01:07:47,665
- I will be there in like...
- Two minutes.

1548
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:49,834
- Two minutes.
- We're on it.

1549
01:07:49,835 --> 01:07:52,236
Ben, do you have the info
on friends shopping together?

1550
01:07:53,038 --> 01:07:54,971
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1551
01:07:54,972 --> 01:07:57,107
- This is Jules.
- What's wrong?

1552
01:07:57,108 --> 01:07:58,241
Oh, Mom, hi.

1553
01:07:58,242 --> 01:07:59,943
Um, I just found out
that the zoom link...

1554
01:07:59,944 --> 01:08:02,112
um, the button that you click on
to zoom in on a photo,

1555
01:08:02,113 --> 01:08:04,815
- isn't working.
- That doesn't sound like such a big deal.

1556
01:08:04,816 --> 01:08:06,450
Well, actually, it is.
Um...

1557
01:08:06,451 --> 01:08:10,287
It's what people use to get
a closer look at what...

1558
01:08:10,288 --> 01:08:11,655
everybody zooms in.

1559
01:08:11,656 --> 01:08:14,224
I guess I don't go to your
website enough to know that.

1560
01:08:19,931 --> 01:08:21,832
Oh, typing and ringing.

1561
01:08:21,833 --> 01:08:23,367
Yeah, sorry.
Oh, it's the warehouse.

1562
01:08:23,368 --> 01:08:24,835
Mom, I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?

1563
01:08:24,836 --> 01:08:26,536
- No need.
- Okay, love you.

1564
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:27,704
Yep.

1565
01:08:27,705 --> 01:08:30,540
Who says "yep" to "I love you"?

1566
01:08:35,514 --> 01:08:36,780
Hi, Alonzo.

1567
01:08:36,781 --> 01:08:37,781
Hi, Jules.

1568
01:08:37,782 --> 01:08:39,049
Not good news.

1569
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:40,651
What? Okay.
Lay it on me.

1570
01:08:40,652 --> 01:08:43,353
In a routine check
by the sanitation department,

1571
01:08:43,354 --> 01:08:44,721
they found one bedbug.

1572
01:08:44,722 --> 01:08:46,957
- No.
- Unfortunately, yes.

1573
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:49,126
We sent out 4,800 boxes
yesterday.

1574
01:08:49,127 --> 01:08:51,328
We have to get them all back,
shut down the warehouse...

1575
01:08:51,329 --> 01:08:52,863
- Ugh.
- Spray for bedbugs,

1576
01:08:52,864 --> 01:08:54,698
then we can start shipping
again.

1577
01:08:54,699 --> 01:08:55,866
- Nightmare.
- Nightmare.

1578
01:08:55,867 --> 01:08:57,033
Okay, here we are.

1579
01:08:57,034 --> 01:08:59,071
Okay,
let me just finish this e-mail.

1580
01:09:17,588 --> 01:09:19,222
No!

1581
01:09:19,223 --> 01:09:20,357
No.

1582
01:09:20,358 --> 01:09:21,426
No, no, no.

1583
01:09:29,133 --> 01:09:31,168
Hey, guys.
Thanks for coming.

1584
01:09:31,169 --> 01:09:32,502
I know the zoom is broken,

1585
01:09:32,503 --> 01:09:33,970
and I don't mean to
pull anyone off of that,

1586
01:09:33,971 --> 01:09:35,639
but I need a favor.

1587
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,807
I accidentally sent an e-mail
to the wrong person,

1588
01:09:37,808 --> 01:09:39,543
and she's at work right now.

1589
01:09:39,544 --> 01:09:41,144
And I know she doesn't check
her personal e-mail

1590
01:09:41,145 --> 01:09:42,679
until she gets home
at 5:30.

1591
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,548
So I have until then
to figure out how to delete it.

1592
01:09:44,549 --> 01:09:47,451
Because if this person sees
this e-mail, it'll be horrible.

1593
01:09:47,452 --> 01:09:50,020
And on top of that,
she has a minor heart condition.

1594
01:09:50,021 --> 01:09:52,055
I think this could
possibly be not good for that.

1595
01:09:52,056 --> 01:09:55,826
So I am counting on
your good graces and brilliance

1596
01:09:55,827 --> 01:09:57,928
to figure out
a way to save my ass.

1597
01:09:57,929 --> 01:09:59,662
Truthfully, Jules,
it's pretty impossible

1598
01:09:59,663 --> 01:10:01,031
to hack into a server.

1599
01:10:01,032 --> 01:10:02,766
And you don't know her password?

1600
01:10:02,767 --> 01:10:04,167
No idea.

1601
01:10:04,168 --> 01:10:06,336
Jules, I think there's only
one thing we can do.

1602
01:10:06,337 --> 01:10:07,904
What? Tell me.
I'm dying.

1603
01:10:07,905 --> 01:10:09,406
Me and the boys take off,

1604
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:12,275
we break into your Mom's house,
and we steal her computer.

1605
01:10:12,276 --> 01:10:14,811
Break into her house
and steal the computer?

1606
01:10:14,812 --> 01:10:16,281
Are you kidding me?

1607
01:10:17,582 --> 01:10:19,316
That's freaking genius.

1608
01:10:19,317 --> 01:10:22,586
You will reach your destination

1609
01:10:22,587 --> 01:10:24,554
in 300 yards.

1610
01:10:24,555 --> 01:10:28,492
Little does GPS lady know
she is an accomplice to a crime.

1611
01:10:28,493 --> 01:10:30,627
The woman has a heart condition.
Think of it as a good deed.

1612
01:10:30,628 --> 01:10:33,263
I never thought you'd be a bad
influence on me, Whittaker.

1613
01:10:33,264 --> 01:10:35,832
Oh, relax, fellas. This is
gonna be a piece of cake.

1614
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:37,167
The key is under a flowerpot.

1615
01:10:37,168 --> 01:10:39,202
We go in, we delete,
we disappear.

1616
01:10:39,203 --> 01:10:40,504
She doesn't have an alarm,
right?

1617
01:10:40,505 --> 01:10:41,705
Nope.
She does not.

1618
01:10:41,706 --> 01:10:43,840
What if there's, like,
a password on the e-mail? Hmm?

1619
01:10:43,841 --> 01:10:45,342
Then we take the computer.

1620
01:10:45,343 --> 01:10:48,144
Jules said she'd buy her
a new one, so it's a win-win.

1621
01:10:48,145 --> 01:10:51,381
You will reach your destination
in 100 yards.

1622
01:10:51,382 --> 01:10:52,883
This is like an "Oceans" movie.

1623
01:10:52,884 --> 01:10:54,884
Ben's the old guy
with the big glasses.

1624
01:10:54,885 --> 01:10:56,353
His name is Elliott Gould.

1625
01:10:56,354 --> 01:10:58,556
- Yeah, and, Jason, you're Clooney.
- Thank you.

1626
01:10:58,557 --> 01:11:00,691
And I'll be Matt Damon
'cause I'm kind of an outsider.

1627
01:11:00,692 --> 01:11:01,992
Yeah, definitely.
Who am I?

1628
01:11:01,993 --> 01:11:03,660
Uh, you are
Ben Affleck's brother.

1629
01:11:03,661 --> 01:11:05,196
Well, why aren't I Brad Pitt?

1630
01:11:05,197 --> 01:11:08,198
I think that's kind of
self-explanatory.

1631
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:19,176
- Okay, Clooney.
- Thank you.

1632
01:11:19,177 --> 01:11:20,577
You're behind the wheel.

1633
01:11:20,578 --> 01:11:21,846
Park on the street.

1634
01:11:21,847 --> 01:11:23,580
Keep the engine running,
your eyes open.

1635
01:11:23,581 --> 01:11:26,282
Damon, Affleck's brother,
you're with me.

1636
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:27,853
All right, let's do this.

1637
01:11:29,221 --> 01:11:32,057
Remember,
the key's under the flowerpot.

1638
01:11:49,607 --> 01:11:50,841
Oh, no.

1639
01:11:50,842 --> 01:11:53,243
Oh, great plan so far.
Oh, my God.

1640
01:11:53,244 --> 01:11:55,212
- Lewis, get Becky.
- If we don't know the code,

1641
01:11:55,213 --> 01:11:56,913
this is gonna turn into an alarm
in 60 seconds.

1642
01:11:56,914 --> 01:11:58,515
Becky, put Jules on.

1643
01:11:58,516 --> 01:12:00,284
She put me on hold.
What is wrong with that girl?

1644
01:12:00,285 --> 01:12:02,953
This is so not good.
What are we supposed to do, Ben?

1645
01:12:02,954 --> 01:12:04,120
- What are we supposed...
- stop eating!

1646
01:12:04,121 --> 01:12:05,255
- Uh-huh!
- Go look for the computer!

1647
01:12:05,256 --> 01:12:06,857
Right now!
Go! Go! Go!

1648
01:12:06,858 --> 01:12:08,291
No! Separately!
Separate...

1649
01:12:08,292 --> 01:12:09,960
Ben.
Ben, you there?

1650
01:12:09,961 --> 01:12:12,096
Becky, don't screw around.
Put Jules on. It's an emergency.

1651
01:12:12,097 --> 01:12:14,531
- She's in a meeting.
- Interrupt her.

1652
01:12:14,532 --> 01:12:15,500
Ben, what's up?

1653
01:12:15,501 --> 01:12:17,200
Jules, your mother has an alarm.

1654
01:12:17,201 --> 01:12:18,836
- No, she doesn't.
- Yes, she does.

1655
01:12:18,837 --> 01:12:20,871
I'm in her kitchen. It's about
to go off. What's her code?

1656
01:12:20,872 --> 01:12:22,739
I have no idea.
Ben, listen to me.

1657
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,007
I know this woman.

1658
01:12:24,008 --> 01:12:25,342
That is a fake alarm
that she bought

1659
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,576
off of some infomercial
or something, okay?

1660
01:12:26,577 --> 01:12:28,111
It's not real.
It's not connected.

1661
01:12:28,112 --> 01:12:29,580
It's just to scare off burglars.

1662
01:12:29,581 --> 01:12:31,315
She says it's fake.
It's just to scare off burglars.

1663
01:12:31,316 --> 01:12:33,149
Oh, well, it's doing a good job.

1664
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:35,286
Listen, my parents would never
pay for an alarm, okay?

1665
01:12:35,287 --> 01:12:36,753
They're the cheapest people
in America.

1666
01:12:36,754 --> 01:12:38,889
Okay, well, it hasn't
turned into an alarm yet.

1667
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:41,091
- It's still beeping.
- That's 'cause it's a fake.

1668
01:12:41,092 --> 01:12:42,726
Trust me on this one.
Have you found the computer?

1669
01:12:42,727 --> 01:12:44,027
It's not down here.

1670
01:12:48,633 --> 01:12:50,635
Lewis, go in there.
Davis, in there.

1671
01:12:53,237 --> 01:12:55,538
- Found it!
- Got it! What?

1672
01:12:55,539 --> 01:12:57,507
We found two. Which one is hers?
The white one or the silver one?

1673
01:12:57,508 --> 01:12:59,242
The white one or the silver one?

1674
01:12:59,243 --> 01:13:00,510
The white one or the silver one?
White one or the silver one?

1675
01:13:00,511 --> 01:13:01,979
- Your Mom's computer?
- Yes.

1676
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,180
It's white.
I got it fixed for her once.

1677
01:13:03,181 --> 01:13:04,748
- I am positive.
- The white one!

1678
01:13:04,749 --> 01:13:06,284
White.

1679
01:13:09,921 --> 01:13:11,654
Oh, my God.

1680
01:13:11,655 --> 01:13:14,224
I knew there was no such thing
as a fake alarm!

1681
01:13:14,225 --> 01:13:15,959
We're gonna get arrested!
I knew it!

1682
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,294
That's it! We're done!

1683
01:13:17,295 --> 01:13:19,195
Our fingerprints
are all over this place!

1684
01:13:19,196 --> 01:13:20,564
Ben, do you see the e-mail?

1685
01:13:20,565 --> 01:13:22,699
- Not yet.
- Double-time it, dude.

1686
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,001
Here, let me.

1687
01:13:25,002 --> 01:13:26,370
Found it!

1688
01:13:26,371 --> 01:13:28,372
"Why is my mother
always such a raging bitch?"

1689
01:13:28,373 --> 01:13:30,273
{\an8}Subject...
"she's a terrorist."

1690
01:13:30,274 --> 01:13:31,742
<i>Yes! Delete it!</i>

1691
01:13:31,743 --> 01:13:32,842
Gone.

1692
01:13:32,843 --> 01:13:34,212
Now from the trash!

1693
01:13:36,013 --> 01:13:37,080
Got it.

1694
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:40,050
Davis, where'd you find this?

1695
01:13:40,051 --> 01:13:41,151
Under the bed, right side.

1696
01:13:41,152 --> 01:13:42,585
Which right side?

1697
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:44,721
Right side facing the bed!
Oh, my God! My life is over!

1698
01:13:44,722 --> 01:13:47,257
I'm gonna be a felon and
I have not committed a crime!

1699
01:13:47,258 --> 01:13:48,525
Davis.
Davis, pull it together.

1700
01:13:48,526 --> 01:13:50,227
Can't you hear
how far away that is?

1701
01:13:50,228 --> 01:13:51,828
We've got at least 30 seconds
until they're here.

1702
01:13:51,829 --> 01:13:53,530
How am I gonna
explain this to my parents?

1703
01:13:53,531 --> 01:13:54,931
Oh, my God.
My lisp is back!

1704
01:13:54,932 --> 01:13:56,600
- 20 seconds.
- Oh!

1705
01:13:56,601 --> 01:13:58,336
Just run! Run!

1706
01:14:19,924 --> 01:14:22,592
Jason!

1707
01:14:22,593 --> 01:14:23,593
Open the door!

1708
01:14:26,831 --> 01:14:30,199
Jason! Open the door!

1709
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,235
Open the fucking door!

1710
01:14:32,236 --> 01:14:33,804
Whoa!
Whoa, okay!

1711
01:14:33,805 --> 01:14:35,206
Okay!

1712
01:14:36,544 --> 01:14:38,942
Hold on! I'm not in!
I'm not in! I'm not in!

1713
01:14:38,943 --> 01:14:40,478
I'm in.

1714
01:14:43,013 --> 01:14:44,248
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1715
01:14:46,684 --> 01:14:49,252
You are a crazy son of a bitch.
You know that, right?

1716
01:14:49,253 --> 01:14:50,721
I didn't, actually.

1717
01:14:50,722 --> 01:14:52,555
I'm sure my blood pressure
was through the roof.

1718
01:14:52,556 --> 01:14:54,457
But it was worth it.
Good times!

1719
01:14:55,544 --> 01:14:56,627
Guys, I can't...

1720
01:14:56,628 --> 01:14:59,596
I literally can't thank you
enough for what you just did.

1721
01:14:59,597 --> 01:15:03,633
It was so above and beyond
and brave and loyal.

1722
01:15:03,634 --> 01:15:05,335
I am indebted to you forever.

1723
01:15:05,336 --> 01:15:06,737
- No, you're not.
- Well, you're very welcome.

1724
01:15:06,738 --> 01:15:07,904
You know...

1725
01:15:07,905 --> 01:15:10,674
Takes a team, but it's done.

1726
01:15:10,675 --> 01:15:13,510
- All taken care of.
- Okay.

1727
01:15:13,511 --> 01:15:15,512
I'm gonna have another.
Anybody else?

1728
01:15:15,513 --> 01:15:16,846
- I would love that.
- Yeah, let's do that.

1729
01:15:16,847 --> 01:15:19,749
Yeah. But could I just get
a half this time?

1730
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,851
I'll take his half.

1731
01:15:20,852 --> 01:15:22,353
We'll all have doubles.

1732
01:15:23,754 --> 01:15:26,423
N-No, it's okay. I can drink.
It's a thing about me.

1733
01:15:26,424 --> 01:15:27,724
Now, what are your names, again?

1734
01:15:27,725 --> 01:15:29,192
I never want to not know you.

1735
01:15:29,193 --> 01:15:30,561
I'm Jason.

1736
01:15:30,562 --> 01:15:32,662
I've worked for you
for like a year.

1737
01:15:32,663 --> 01:15:34,564
I've delivered things
to your home.

1738
01:15:34,565 --> 01:15:35,866
I met Matt a bunch of times.

1739
01:15:35,867 --> 01:15:37,834
I've tied your daughter's shoe
before.

1740
01:15:37,835 --> 01:15:39,970
I... I know who you are.
I'm just terrible with names.

1741
01:15:39,971 --> 01:15:41,705
It's all right.
It's Jason.

1742
01:15:41,706 --> 01:15:42,739
You're new, right?

1743
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:44,040
Yeah.
I'm Davis.

1744
01:15:44,041 --> 01:15:45,642
I started work
the same day as Ben.

1745
01:15:45,643 --> 01:15:47,777
We're pretty much besties,
and I'm his mentee.

1746
01:15:47,778 --> 01:15:49,981
- Oh.
- He gave me this tie, for example.

1747
01:15:49,984 --> 01:15:51,481
It was his.
It's vintage.

1748
01:15:51,482 --> 01:15:53,349
- "Vintage."
- I like it.

1749
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:54,685
I like men in ties.

1750
01:15:54,686 --> 01:15:56,586
- And, you're Lewis.
- Yes.

1751
01:15:56,587 --> 01:15:58,288
Yeah, I could hear a little bit
over the phone.

1752
01:15:58,289 --> 01:15:59,756
You were very cool
under pressure.

1753
01:15:59,757 --> 01:16:02,158
Well, it was my first heist.
I tried to be chill.

1754
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:03,259
Thanks for noticing.

1755
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:05,062
Salut.

1756
01:16:05,063 --> 01:16:06,196
- Mm!
- Whoo!

1757
01:16:06,197 --> 01:16:08,798
Boys, what can I say...

1758
01:16:08,799 --> 01:16:09,833
I'm sorry.

1759
01:16:09,834 --> 01:16:11,568
I didn't mean
to call you "boys."

1760
01:16:11,569 --> 01:16:13,403
Nobody calls men "men" anymore.

1761
01:16:13,404 --> 01:16:14,671
Have you noticed?

1762
01:16:14,672 --> 01:16:16,272
Women went from "girls"
to "women."

1763
01:16:16,273 --> 01:16:17,707
Men went from "men" to "boys"?

1764
01:16:17,708 --> 01:16:20,210
This is a problem
in the big picture.

1765
01:16:20,211 --> 01:16:22,412
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1766
01:16:22,413 --> 01:16:23,947
I'm gonna have another.

1767
01:16:23,948 --> 01:16:25,348
Another?
You sure about that?

1768
01:16:25,349 --> 01:16:27,918
Yep. Okay,
here's my theory about this.

1769
01:16:27,919 --> 01:16:30,687
We all grew up during the "take
your daughter to work day" thing, right?

1770
01:16:30,688 --> 01:16:32,055
Mm-hmm.

1771
01:16:32,056 --> 01:16:35,358
So we were always told we could
be anything, do anything.

1772
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:38,261
And I think guys got,
maybe not left behind,

1773
01:16:38,262 --> 01:16:39,962
but not quite as nurtured,
you know?

1774
01:16:39,963 --> 01:16:43,166
I mean, like, we were the
generation of "you go, girl."

1775
01:16:43,167 --> 01:16:44,968
We had Oprah.

1776
01:16:44,969 --> 01:16:48,305
And I wonder sometimes
how guys fit in, you know?

1777
01:16:48,306 --> 01:16:49,840
They still seem to be
trying to figure it out.

1778
01:16:49,841 --> 01:16:51,574
They're still dressing
like little boys.

1779
01:16:51,575 --> 01:16:53,209
They're still playing
video games.

1780
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:55,011
Well, they've gotten great.
So...

1781
01:16:55,012 --> 01:16:56,880
I love video games.

1782
01:16:56,881 --> 01:16:58,381
Oh, boy.

1783
01:16:58,382 --> 01:17:00,617
How, in one generation,
have men gone from

1784
01:17:00,618 --> 01:17:04,622
guys like Jack Nicholson
and Harrison Ford to...

1785
01:17:08,192 --> 01:17:09,993
Take Ben, here.

1786
01:17:09,994 --> 01:17:11,962
A dying breed.
You know?

1787
01:17:11,963 --> 01:17:13,363
Look and learn, boys,

1788
01:17:13,364 --> 01:17:15,698
because if you ask me,
this is what cool is.

1789
01:17:15,699 --> 01:17:18,168
Oh, thanks, Ace. You're not
gonna drink anymore, right?

1790
01:17:18,169 --> 01:17:20,303
Calling me "Ace"?

1791
01:17:20,304 --> 01:17:22,005
That is just super cool, right?

1792
01:17:22,006 --> 01:17:23,306
- Definitely.
- Very cool.

1793
01:17:23,307 --> 01:17:26,109
Okay.
I am officially a little dizzy.

1794
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:27,944
I apologize for the tirade.

1795
01:17:27,945 --> 01:17:30,480
I am gonna go.

1796
01:17:30,481 --> 01:17:34,751
But I am forever in your debt,
gentlemen.

1797
01:17:34,752 --> 01:17:37,320
Another word
which is never used anymore.

1798
01:17:37,321 --> 01:17:39,222
Let's bring it back, shall we?

1799
01:17:39,223 --> 01:17:42,793
- Yes.
- Ben, I'll be ubering home.

1800
01:17:42,794 --> 01:17:44,294
- Thanks again.
- Whoa! Whoa!

1801
01:17:44,295 --> 01:17:45,328
Okay.

1802
01:17:45,329 --> 01:17:47,764
I'm so sorry.

1803
01:17:47,765 --> 01:17:49,298
Don't worry.

1804
01:17:49,299 --> 01:17:52,035
I'm fine now.

1805
01:17:52,036 --> 01:17:53,838
Okay.

1806
01:17:53,841 --> 01:17:55,271
It's okay, it's okay.

1807
01:17:57,875 --> 01:18:00,845
Oh, I haven't done that
since college.

1808
01:18:04,448 --> 01:18:06,650
Thank you.

1809
01:18:06,651 --> 01:18:09,352
Oh, man.

1810
01:18:09,353 --> 01:18:12,122
Very sorry you had to see that.

1811
01:18:12,123 --> 01:18:13,356
Humiliating.

1812
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:14,591
It's all good.

1813
01:18:14,592 --> 01:18:16,626
You feeling better?

1814
01:18:16,627 --> 01:18:17,994
Yeah.

1815
01:18:17,995 --> 01:18:21,699
Yeah, I forgot you got to eat
before you drink.

1816
01:18:23,701 --> 01:18:24,967
I'm good now.

1817
01:18:24,968 --> 01:18:27,438
Thank you.

1818
01:18:35,513 --> 01:18:38,114
I'm leaving in a minute.

1819
01:18:38,115 --> 01:18:41,684
Just working on making this
the worst possible day for you.

1820
01:18:41,685 --> 01:18:44,589
No, not at all.
You've had a stressful day.

1821
01:18:48,859 --> 01:18:52,962
How is it that you always
manage to say the right thing...

1822
01:18:52,963 --> 01:18:56,199
Do the right thing,
be the right thing?

1823
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,468
It's uncanny.

1824
01:18:58,469 --> 01:19:00,170
You...
you get some rest.

1825
01:19:00,171 --> 01:19:01,470
I will.

1826
01:19:01,471 --> 01:19:03,374
Thanks for everything.

1827
01:19:07,978 --> 01:19:10,480
Oh, and, uh...

1828
01:19:10,481 --> 01:19:13,049
Sayonara.

1829
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:15,752
Absolutely.

1830
01:19:28,999 --> 01:19:30,767
Really so nice of you
to do this.

1831
01:19:30,768 --> 01:19:32,535
Most women would have
just rescheduled.

1832
01:19:32,536 --> 01:19:35,372
Oh, not to worry.
I understand.

1833
01:19:35,373 --> 01:19:37,740
It was unexpected.

1834
01:19:37,741 --> 01:19:39,208
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1835
01:19:39,209 --> 01:19:40,645
You're welcome.

1836
01:19:48,085 --> 01:19:50,286
- Hi.
- Oh. Come on in.

1837
01:19:50,287 --> 01:19:52,623
Oh, no, after you.
Go ahead.

1838
01:19:55,026 --> 01:19:58,528
Benji, you brought a date
to a funeral. Unreal.

1839
01:19:58,529 --> 01:20:00,697
We had plans.
Who knew this was gonna happen?

1840
01:20:00,698 --> 01:20:02,832
Well, how do you do?
I'm Miles.

1841
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:04,134
Hello. Fiona.

1842
01:20:04,135 --> 01:20:05,501
I'm so sorry for your loss.

1843
01:20:05,502 --> 01:20:08,505
Oh, thank you, dear.

1844
01:20:08,506 --> 01:20:10,240
Wowza!

1845
01:20:45,076 --> 01:20:47,410
I never went to a Shiva before.

1846
01:20:47,411 --> 01:20:48,878
The laughter was wonderful.

1847
01:20:48,879 --> 01:20:50,647
I don't think
I've ever eaten more.

1848
01:20:50,648 --> 01:20:53,383
I'm not even sure how I left
with a box of cookies.

1849
01:20:53,384 --> 01:20:54,950
Well, you were a big hit.

1850
01:20:54,951 --> 01:20:57,753
Giving the widow that
back massage... winning move.

1851
01:20:57,754 --> 01:20:59,822
Oh, yeah.
She needed it.

1852
01:20:59,823 --> 01:21:01,391
I definitely think
it's a good idea

1853
01:21:01,392 --> 01:21:03,493
to take all first dates
to a funeral.

1854
01:21:03,494 --> 01:21:05,862
Yeah. A real icebreaker,
don't you think?

1855
01:21:06,864 --> 01:21:08,565
I know you're kidding
but, honestly,

1856
01:21:08,566 --> 01:21:10,666
who needs the strain
of the dinner date?

1857
01:21:10,667 --> 01:21:12,836
And the "why aren't you
married?" Conversation.

1858
01:21:12,837 --> 01:21:16,706
At our age it's not even
possible to catch up.

1859
01:21:16,707 --> 01:21:19,877
Well, I can do me in 10 seconds.

1860
01:21:21,145 --> 01:21:22,747
- You ready?
- Yep.

1861
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:25,549
Widower, one son, two grandkids.

1862
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:27,684
Spent my life
manufacturing phonebooks,

1863
01:21:27,685 --> 01:21:29,118
which no longer serve a purpose.

1864
01:21:30,121 --> 01:21:31,955
I'm currently working
as an intern,

1865
01:21:31,956 --> 01:21:33,856
having a ball.

1866
01:21:33,857 --> 01:21:37,860
And the best news is, I have
a crush on a girl I met at work.

1867
01:21:37,861 --> 01:21:41,164
I'm sorry you lost your wife.

1868
01:21:41,165 --> 01:21:42,198
Okay.

1869
01:21:42,199 --> 01:21:43,566
Divorced.

1870
01:21:43,567 --> 01:21:45,067
Three beautiful daughters.

1871
01:21:45,068 --> 01:21:48,037
One grandchild, a boy,
on the way.

1872
01:21:48,038 --> 01:21:49,572
I was sick a few years back.

1873
01:21:49,573 --> 01:21:50,807
I'm not anymore.

1874
01:21:50,808 --> 01:21:53,343
I'm an in-house
e-commerce masseuse.

1875
01:21:53,344 --> 01:21:54,844
Love my job.

1876
01:21:54,845 --> 01:21:59,549
And I finally met a man I
actually want to hang out with.

1877
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:00,985
Lucky me.

1878
01:22:17,601 --> 01:22:18,802
Morning.

1879
01:22:18,803 --> 01:22:20,603
Hey, buddy.
You don't look so great.

1880
01:22:20,604 --> 01:22:22,239
Yeah, I know.

1881
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:25,676
But believe me, I look better than I feel.

1882
01:22:25,677 --> 01:22:26,909
Oh, did you see the Yankees
last night?

1883
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:29,278
- Oh, they were on fire.
- Oh, man.

1884
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:31,380
Got to get something
in your stomach.

1885
01:22:31,381 --> 01:22:32,815
Honey, honey, honey.

1886
01:22:32,816 --> 01:22:34,851
Just can you please take
one bite before school?

1887
01:22:34,852 --> 01:22:36,252
Please?
Just one bite?

1888
01:22:36,253 --> 01:22:38,888
Hey, what's with the waterworks,
little one?

1889
01:22:38,889 --> 01:22:40,156
I just told her that
the sitter's gonna have to

1890
01:22:40,157 --> 01:22:41,624
take her to
Maddie's birthday party

1891
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:42,892
because Matt's feeling sick.

1892
01:22:42,893 --> 01:22:46,863
But I don't want to go
with the sitter.

1893
01:22:46,864 --> 01:22:47,998
Ben?

1894
01:22:47,999 --> 01:22:50,333
Can you take me?

1895
01:22:50,334 --> 01:22:52,068
Please?

1896
01:22:52,069 --> 01:22:53,369
Oh, honey?

1897
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:57,039
I'm so sorry, but Ben's
got to go to work today.

1898
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:01,477
Jules. Come on.
It'll take an hour.

1899
01:23:01,478 --> 01:23:03,314
Let me take her.

1900
01:23:06,017 --> 01:23:08,051
I... I can't believe
we're still going through this.

1901
01:23:08,052 --> 01:23:10,954
I'm going the right way.
Please have a little trust.

1902
01:23:10,955 --> 01:23:13,122
But the park
where the party is...

1903
01:23:13,123 --> 01:23:14,824
Oh. Sorry, Ben.

1904
01:23:14,825 --> 01:23:17,726
Actually, this is it.

1905
01:23:17,727 --> 01:23:19,795
You're like a clone.

1906
01:23:19,796 --> 01:23:22,799
Oh, boy.
This looks like a nice party.

1907
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,901
Yeah, it does.

1908
01:23:24,902 --> 01:23:26,469
So which one is Maddie?

1909
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:28,671
The one in the pink.

1910
01:23:28,672 --> 01:23:31,175
Okay.
The one in the pink.

1911
01:23:32,843 --> 01:23:35,378
You can go sit with
the other Moms, okay?

1912
01:23:35,379 --> 01:23:37,646
Okay. You want to
give Maddie her present?

1913
01:23:37,647 --> 01:23:38,682
Yeah.

1914
01:23:38,683 --> 01:23:39,715
Okay.

1915
01:23:39,716 --> 01:23:42,153
Have fun.

1916
01:23:44,121 --> 01:23:45,222
The other Moms.

1917
01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:47,924
Frep... Freprino
or something.

1918
01:23:47,925 --> 01:23:49,559
Yeah, I know.
I don't know any of them.

1919
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,327
Hi. I'm Ben.

1920
01:23:51,328 --> 01:23:52,395
- Hi. Jane.
- Jane.

1921
01:23:52,396 --> 01:23:53,830
- And Emily.
- Hi, Emily.

1922
01:23:53,831 --> 01:23:55,431
I'm helping Matt and Jules out
today.

1923
01:23:55,432 --> 01:23:56,800
Oh, are you Matt's Dad?

1924
01:23:56,801 --> 01:23:59,035
No, no.
I work for Jules.

1925
01:23:59,036 --> 01:24:00,269
Oh.

1926
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:01,838
That's okay?

1927
01:24:01,839 --> 01:24:05,341
I've just heard she's,
you know, kind of tough.

1928
01:24:05,342 --> 01:24:07,977
Tough? Jules? Sure.
She's a total badass.

1929
01:24:07,978 --> 01:24:10,780
I guess that's how she became
an Internet sensation.

1930
01:24:10,781 --> 01:24:12,649
Must make you guys proud, huh?

1931
01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:14,050
One of your own out there
every day,

1932
01:24:14,051 --> 01:24:16,186
crashing the glass ceiling
of the tech world.

1933
01:24:16,187 --> 01:24:19,489
So, bravo, good for her.
Right?

1934
01:24:19,490 --> 01:24:21,490
Y-Yeah.
No, for sure.

1935
01:24:22,927 --> 01:24:24,360
What's up, kiddo?

1936
01:24:24,361 --> 01:24:25,729
I don't feel good.

1937
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:28,564
You don't?
Do you want to sit on my lap?

1938
01:24:28,565 --> 01:24:31,934
You know, if she's sick
she probably shouldn't be here.

1939
01:24:31,935 --> 01:24:34,904
Tough crowd, Paigey.
You want to hit the road?

1940
01:24:34,905 --> 01:24:36,439
Does that mean "leave"?

1941
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,842
'Fraid so.

1942
01:24:39,509 --> 01:24:45,248
I spy with my little eye
something... Blue!

1943
01:24:45,249 --> 01:24:47,383
Is it the car next to us?

1944
01:24:47,384 --> 01:24:48,685
No.

1945
01:24:48,686 --> 01:24:51,420
Is it, um, that dog leash?

1946
01:24:51,421 --> 01:24:52,989
No.

1947
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:54,857
Um, is it the sky?

1948
01:24:54,858 --> 01:24:56,625
Yes! You got one.

1949
01:24:56,626 --> 01:24:57,994
Your turn, Ben.

1950
01:24:57,995 --> 01:24:59,561
Okay.

1951
01:24:59,562 --> 01:25:01,064
Oh, I have a good one.

1952
01:25:01,065 --> 01:25:04,600
I spy with my little eye
something green.

1953
01:25:04,601 --> 01:25:06,302
Is it that tree?

1954
01:25:06,303 --> 01:25:07,570
Nope.

1955
01:25:07,571 --> 01:25:09,505
Is it that front door?

1956
01:25:09,506 --> 01:25:11,876
Well, it's kind of green.

1957
01:25:27,324 --> 01:25:28,992
Is it, Ben?

1958
01:25:28,993 --> 01:25:31,362
Is it that front door?

1959
01:25:33,897 --> 01:25:36,734
Yeah, it is, honey.
Good girl.

1960
01:26:49,773 --> 01:26:52,009
Thanks so much, Ben.

1961
01:27:07,858 --> 01:27:09,291
Hey, come on in the kitchen.

1962
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:11,093
Can I get you something
before you hit the road?

1963
01:27:11,094 --> 01:27:13,830
Want a cup of coffee
or a bite to eat?

1964
01:27:13,831 --> 01:27:15,364
Uh, I'm good, thanks.

1965
01:27:15,365 --> 01:27:18,067
Okay. How was she?
She give you any trouble?

1966
01:27:18,068 --> 01:27:19,601
She was perfect.

1967
01:27:19,602 --> 01:27:21,770
She wasn't feeling so great
at the party, so we left early,

1968
01:27:21,771 --> 01:27:25,842
and she just fell asleep in the
car, so I let her get a nap in.

1969
01:27:25,843 --> 01:27:27,510
So nice of you.
Thank you.

1970
01:27:28,746 --> 01:27:30,047
Sorry.

1971
01:27:34,184 --> 01:27:36,185
You seem like
you're feeling more with it.

1972
01:27:36,186 --> 01:27:38,020
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Um...

1973
01:27:38,021 --> 01:27:40,023
I guess I just needed
a little downtime.

1974
01:27:40,024 --> 01:27:43,960
You know, or maybe I wasn't even
that sick, I don't know.

1975
01:27:43,961 --> 01:27:46,629
Hey, Ben, I got something
I wanted to ask.

1976
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:49,531
What's your whole take
on the CEO thing?

1977
01:27:49,532 --> 01:27:52,335
I mean, you're more
on the inside than I am.

1978
01:27:52,336 --> 01:27:55,504
I know Jules is trying to
do right by everybody...

1979
01:27:55,505 --> 01:27:57,306
the investors.

1980
01:27:57,307 --> 01:27:58,640
The company.

1981
01:27:58,641 --> 01:27:59,641
You.

1982
01:28:01,244 --> 01:28:02,778
She's got a lot
on her shoulders.

1983
01:28:02,779 --> 01:28:05,015
The pressure is unbelievable.

1984
01:28:07,318 --> 01:28:12,021
Am I wrong
that I want it to happen?

1985
01:28:12,022 --> 01:28:14,190
I mean, I-I want what she wants,

1986
01:28:14,191 --> 01:28:16,993
but you know what it's like
around here.

1987
01:28:16,994 --> 01:28:19,963
We don't see her enough,
and maybe this can fix that.

1988
01:28:19,964 --> 01:28:23,267
A CEO's gonna fix
what's going on here, Matt?

1989
01:28:26,403 --> 01:28:30,072
Whatever she decides, I just...
I want it to be good for her.

1990
01:28:30,073 --> 01:28:32,643
I want her to be happy.

1991
01:28:34,477 --> 01:28:35,878
Of course.

1992
01:28:35,879 --> 01:28:38,582
She deserves that.

1993
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:43,254
Yeah, she does deserve it.

1994
01:28:50,727 --> 01:28:52,663
Hi, Amy.

1995
01:28:58,401 --> 01:29:00,603
Benjamin, what do you think?

1996
01:29:00,604 --> 01:29:01,837
Found it on ebay.

1997
01:29:01,838 --> 01:29:03,239
You were right.
Total classic.

1998
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,273
It's awesome, kid.

1999
01:29:31,168 --> 01:29:32,534
So, how did it go?

2000
01:29:32,535 --> 01:29:34,703
Oh. Well, you have a great kid,
Jules.

2001
01:29:34,704 --> 01:29:36,105
She's adorable.

2002
01:29:36,106 --> 01:29:38,941
Oh, thank you so much
for doing that.

2003
01:29:38,942 --> 01:29:41,645
So, you excited about our trip
to San Francisco tomorrow?

2004
01:29:43,047 --> 01:29:45,582
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

2005
01:29:46,716 --> 01:29:49,018
Oh, I hope you don't have
what Matt has.

2006
01:29:49,019 --> 01:29:50,019
I don't.

2007
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:51,020
You sure?

2008
01:29:51,021 --> 01:29:52,289
Positive.

2009
01:29:53,990 --> 01:29:55,157
What's that?

2010
01:29:55,158 --> 01:29:56,158
Blood pressure.

2011
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,160
I take it every day.

2012
01:29:58,161 --> 01:29:59,396
Are you sure you're okay?

2013
01:29:59,397 --> 01:30:00,629
Yeah.

2014
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:03,032
You don't look like you.
You're all flushed.

2015
01:30:03,033 --> 01:30:04,967
Why don't you go see Fiona,
the masseuse,

2016
01:30:04,968 --> 01:30:06,668
and just chill a little.

2017
01:30:06,669 --> 01:30:07,669
What's up?

2018
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:09,405
Whoa, Ben, you okay?

2019
01:30:09,406 --> 01:30:12,241
You seem to be
slightly malfunctioning.

2020
01:30:12,242 --> 01:30:14,644
Becky.
Does he look right to you?

2021
01:30:14,645 --> 01:30:16,312
Okay. Thank you.

2022
01:30:16,313 --> 01:30:17,746
I think we're good here.

2023
01:30:17,747 --> 01:30:19,081
Got a lot of work to do.

2024
01:30:19,082 --> 01:30:20,849
It's all good.

2025
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:22,985
Is it his coloring?

2026
01:30:22,986 --> 01:30:24,086
Oh, my God, you're all nuts.

2027
01:30:24,087 --> 01:30:25,654
I'm 100%.
Let's move on, kids.

2028
01:30:25,655 --> 01:30:27,490
Big day. Lots to do.

2029
01:30:27,491 --> 01:30:29,759
Okay. Ben...

2030
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,128
If I am giving you too much to
do or working you too hard,

2031
01:30:32,129 --> 01:30:34,697
please do not feel that you have
to go with me to San Francisco.

2032
01:30:34,698 --> 01:30:36,966
Jules, people my age
get tired sometimes.

2033
01:30:36,967 --> 01:30:38,434
That's all this is.

2034
01:30:38,435 --> 01:30:39,902
You're tired?

2035
01:30:39,903 --> 01:30:42,423
That's why you haven't looked at
me once since I came over here?

2036
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,376
I'm looking at you.

2037
01:30:48,011 --> 01:30:50,480
Jules.
Cameron's on the phone.

2038
01:30:50,481 --> 01:30:51,814
Okay.

2039
01:30:51,815 --> 01:30:54,851
Like, if you don't feel better
tonight or late...

2040
01:30:54,852 --> 01:30:57,453
I'm just saying
I can go by myself, okay?

2041
01:30:57,454 --> 01:31:00,257
I'm a big girl.
I'll be fine.

2042
01:31:09,332 --> 01:31:11,600
Okay, seriously?

2043
01:31:11,601 --> 01:31:13,169
Ben, what is it?

2044
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:15,571
You know, I'm a sensitive man.

2045
01:31:15,572 --> 01:31:16,973
People don't
think that about me.

2046
01:31:16,974 --> 01:31:18,374
I don't look it, but I am.

2047
01:31:18,375 --> 01:31:20,610
Under all this man stuff
that you so admire...

2048
01:31:20,611 --> 01:31:22,213
Mm-hmm.

2049
01:31:22,214 --> 01:31:23,813
I'm just a big bowl of mush.

2050
01:31:23,814 --> 01:31:25,748
I know that.

2051
01:31:25,749 --> 01:31:27,351
Okay.

2052
01:31:28,952 --> 01:31:30,486
That's it?

2053
01:31:30,487 --> 01:31:33,088
That's what
24 hours of crazy comes to?

2054
01:31:33,089 --> 01:31:35,491
That you're
a sensitive bowl of mush?

2055
01:31:35,492 --> 01:31:38,660
Jules.

2056
01:31:38,661 --> 01:31:40,431
Ben.

2057
01:31:42,298 --> 01:31:44,333
Jules, what are we doing here?

2058
01:31:44,334 --> 01:31:46,335
We got the day off.
We're traveling in first-class.

2059
01:31:46,336 --> 01:31:47,970
Let's at least
have a little fun.

2060
01:31:47,971 --> 01:31:50,706
Now, that, I can do.

2061
01:32:17,567 --> 01:32:20,436
Ladies and gentlemen,
as we start our descent,

2062
01:32:20,437 --> 01:32:22,638
please make sure your seat
backs and tray tables

2063
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:24,306
are in their full,
upright positions

2064
01:32:24,307 --> 01:32:26,542
and all carryon luggage
is stowed

2065
01:32:26,543 --> 01:32:28,577
under the seat in front of you.

2066
01:32:28,578 --> 01:32:29,779
You okay?

2067
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:30,813
Yeah.

2068
01:32:30,814 --> 01:32:32,548
Just thinking,
tomorrow I meet the guy

2069
01:32:32,549 --> 01:32:34,450
who may become my Boss, kind of.

2070
01:32:34,451 --> 01:32:36,452
I mean a lot of people
have Bosses, right?

2071
01:32:36,453 --> 01:32:38,955
- Most people have Bosses.
- Jules, it's simple.

2072
01:32:38,956 --> 01:32:40,923
If you think Townsend
is gonna be good for you

2073
01:32:40,924 --> 01:32:42,724
and good for the company,
then do it.

2074
01:32:42,725 --> 01:32:43,726
And if not...

2075
01:32:43,727 --> 01:32:44,661
Exactly.

2076
01:32:44,662 --> 01:32:46,528
Just because
I came all way here...

2077
01:32:46,529 --> 01:32:48,631
Right.
Doesn't mean anything.

2078
01:32:48,632 --> 01:32:50,234
I agree.

2079
01:32:52,035 --> 01:32:53,469
Do you think I can take a Xanax

2080
01:32:53,470 --> 01:32:55,671
if I had two glasses of wine
an hour ago?

2081
01:32:55,672 --> 01:32:58,242
Well, I'd wait
another couple hours.

2082
01:33:03,413 --> 01:33:07,016
It's a thing I do before I land.
We're good now.

2083
01:33:18,361 --> 01:33:19,762
- Jules?
- Yeah.

2084
01:33:19,763 --> 01:33:21,797
- You hear that?
- Uh-huh. I hear it. I'm up.

2085
01:33:39,616 --> 01:33:40,416
Are you okay?

2086
01:33:40,417 --> 01:33:41,650
This alarm going off

2087
01:33:41,651 --> 01:33:43,386
is not a good omen
about this guy.

2088
01:33:43,387 --> 01:33:45,587
- It's a sign, Ben.
- Oh, I'm pretty sure it's not.

2089
01:33:45,588 --> 01:33:47,289
So you haven't
taken a Xanax, yet?

2090
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:49,591
You told me to wait a few hours.

2091
01:33:49,592 --> 01:33:51,527
You travel with your own robe?

2092
01:33:51,528 --> 01:33:53,229
Yeah.

2093
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:54,597
Ladies and gentlemen,

2094
01:33:54,598 --> 01:33:56,765
a smoke alarm went off
in one of the rooms,

2095
01:33:56,766 --> 01:33:58,834
but the problem
has been taken care of.

2096
01:33:58,835 --> 01:33:59,802
Our sincerest apologies.

2097
01:33:59,803 --> 01:34:01,904
Oh, yeah.
100 people, 2 elevators.

2098
01:34:01,905 --> 01:34:04,308
Definitely a sign.

2099
01:34:06,509 --> 01:34:08,177
Well,
thanks for escorting me back.

2100
01:34:08,178 --> 01:34:09,513
Mm-hmm.

2101
01:34:13,016 --> 01:34:15,150
You want to see my room?

2102
01:34:15,151 --> 01:34:16,452
Oh, nice.

2103
01:34:16,453 --> 01:34:18,988
I mean,
do you actually want to come in?

2104
01:34:18,989 --> 01:34:22,691
I have a tea kettle.
We could have tea or...

2105
01:34:24,728 --> 01:34:27,497
I'm ridiculously nervous
about tomorrow.

2106
01:34:31,968 --> 01:34:33,302
You can lie down.

2107
01:34:33,303 --> 01:34:35,439
I know you're tired.
I'll sit in the chair.

2108
01:34:47,083 --> 01:34:48,518
Here you go.

2109
01:34:52,522 --> 01:34:54,123
I thought you were gonna
sit in a chair?

2110
01:34:54,124 --> 01:34:58,295
Please let me be here.
I need to lie down, too.

2111
01:34:59,563 --> 01:35:01,630
We don't have to talk about work
or anything.

2112
01:35:01,631 --> 01:35:05,400
All right.
What should we talk about?

2113
01:35:05,401 --> 01:35:07,704
Marriage?

2114
01:35:10,307 --> 01:35:13,174
Will you tell me
about your wife?

2115
01:35:13,175 --> 01:35:14,843
She was great, right?

2116
01:35:14,844 --> 01:35:16,645
She was.

2117
01:35:16,646 --> 01:35:19,381
Molly was her name.

2118
01:35:19,382 --> 01:35:22,051
She was
a middle-school principal.

2119
01:35:22,052 --> 01:35:23,252
Beloved.

2120
01:35:23,253 --> 01:35:25,087
So perfect.

2121
01:35:25,088 --> 01:35:27,556
Long marriage?

2122
01:35:27,557 --> 01:35:29,224
Not long enough.

2123
01:35:29,225 --> 01:35:30,593
42 years.

2124
01:35:30,594 --> 01:35:33,229
Wow.
What was that like?

2125
01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:35,864
You know when people say
they want to grow old together?

2126
01:35:35,865 --> 01:35:38,901
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, we did that.

2127
01:35:38,902 --> 01:35:40,202
We met when we were 20.

2128
01:35:40,203 --> 01:35:42,838
Well, I was 20.
She was 19.

2129
01:35:42,839 --> 01:35:46,475
And what was amazing
is she never really changed.

2130
01:35:46,476 --> 01:35:49,044
That's a hard thing to pull off.

2131
01:35:49,045 --> 01:35:51,413
She handled life
like it was easy.

2132
01:35:51,414 --> 01:35:53,281
Always.

2133
01:35:53,282 --> 01:35:56,320
Even when it wasn't.

2134
01:35:57,420 --> 01:35:59,356
God, I envy that.

2135
01:36:02,091 --> 01:36:03,360
Are you hungry?

2136
01:36:05,428 --> 01:36:07,429
We have, um...

2137
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:10,832
Gummy bears, chocolate chips,
pringles.

2138
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:11,867
Yup.

2139
01:36:11,868 --> 01:36:14,403
I'm just gonna bring
the whole thing.

2140
01:36:14,404 --> 01:36:17,473
You know those are
like 15 bucks each?

2141
01:36:17,474 --> 01:36:20,208
Benjamin, I run a very big
Internet company.

2142
01:36:20,209 --> 01:36:22,878
Let's go crazy.

2143
01:36:22,879 --> 01:36:25,080
Okay.

2144
01:36:25,081 --> 01:36:26,583
So...

2145
01:36:28,385 --> 01:36:30,719
So...

2146
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,756
Yeah, so...

2147
01:36:34,691 --> 01:36:37,527
I got a weird one for you.

2148
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:42,466
Matt is cheating on me.

2149
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,334
Wait a minute.
You know about this?

2150
01:36:46,335 --> 01:36:48,403
What does that mean?

2151
01:36:48,404 --> 01:36:50,040
Wait, you know about this?

2152
01:36:51,607 --> 01:36:53,542
I saw them together.

2153
01:36:53,543 --> 01:36:55,577
Oh, my God. When?

2154
01:36:55,578 --> 01:36:58,380
Yesterday.

2155
01:36:58,381 --> 01:36:59,814
I'm... I'm sorry.

2156
01:36:59,815 --> 01:37:03,118
I mean, it was an accident
that I saw them, but I did.

2157
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:05,654
Yesterday.

2158
01:37:05,655 --> 01:37:07,958
Then it is still going on.

2159
01:37:09,625 --> 01:37:11,460
How long have you known?

2160
01:37:11,461 --> 01:37:14,296
For like 18 days.

2161
01:37:14,297 --> 01:37:16,166
She's a Mom at Paige's school.

2162
01:37:17,467 --> 01:37:18,900
It's still so hard
for me to grasp.

2163
01:37:18,901 --> 01:37:21,269
I-I was in the kitchen
making sandwiches,

2164
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:22,771
and his phone was there.

2165
01:37:22,772 --> 01:37:24,039
He was upstairs with Paige,

2166
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,841
and h-he was getting
all these text messages.

2167
01:37:25,842 --> 01:37:27,976
And I don't know why,
but I read them.

2168
01:37:27,977 --> 01:37:30,746
It was not good.

2169
01:37:30,747 --> 01:37:32,447
Does he know you know?

2170
01:37:32,448 --> 01:37:33,816
No.

2171
01:37:33,817 --> 01:37:36,518
'Cause, honestly, I'm...
I'm not ready...

2172
01:37:36,519 --> 01:37:37,920
To deal with it.

2173
01:37:37,921 --> 01:37:40,155
I would like to be
a little less devastated,

2174
01:37:40,156 --> 01:37:41,725
if that is possible.

2175
01:37:42,826 --> 01:37:45,026
It's classic, though, isn't it?

2176
01:37:45,027 --> 01:37:46,295
The successful wife.

2177
01:37:46,296 --> 01:37:48,229
The husband feels like
his manhood is threatened,

2178
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:49,965
so he acts out.

2179
01:37:49,966 --> 01:37:53,669
Girlfriend, I guess,
makes him feel more like a man.

2180
01:37:53,670 --> 01:37:57,006
Sometimes I'm not sure
I know how to do that.

2181
01:37:57,007 --> 01:37:58,907
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

2182
01:37:58,908 --> 01:38:01,377
You're not actually taking the
rap for any of this, are you?

2183
01:38:01,378 --> 01:38:03,579
No! No, no.

2184
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:05,047
He is the one
doing something wrong.

2185
01:38:05,048 --> 01:38:06,081
I get that.

2186
01:38:06,082 --> 01:38:07,849
Monogam-ish
is not what I'm after.

2187
01:38:07,850 --> 01:38:11,053
I-I'm just...
I'm taking a sec...

2188
01:38:11,054 --> 01:38:14,255
And I'm hoping that it's just
a horrible lapse in judgment

2189
01:38:14,256 --> 01:38:15,690
and not, like, love.

2190
01:38:15,691 --> 01:38:18,927
And once he moves through this,

2191
01:38:18,928 --> 01:38:21,763
we will eventually
be able to be okay again.

2192
01:38:21,764 --> 01:38:23,633
What do you think about that?

2193
01:38:25,168 --> 01:38:27,636
Clearly you don't think
that's a possible thing.

2194
01:38:27,637 --> 01:38:30,139
- It... it would be unusual.
- I get that.

2195
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:34,276
I get not everybody
could do that, but...

2196
01:38:34,277 --> 01:38:36,712
Everybody's not us.

2197
01:38:36,713 --> 01:38:39,614
I have faith in us because...

2198
01:38:39,615 --> 01:38:41,550
I believe he still loves me.

2199
01:38:41,551 --> 01:38:45,755
And, you know, we've been
going through so much that...

2200
01:38:47,290 --> 01:38:49,925
God, I wish your expressions
weren't so transparent.

2201
01:38:49,926 --> 01:38:53,195
Some couples do survive
these things, you know.

2202
01:38:53,196 --> 01:38:55,263
I googled it... "staying
together after the affair."

2203
01:38:55,264 --> 01:38:57,800
And a lot of couples,
I mean, a lot stay together.

2204
01:38:57,801 --> 01:38:59,635
And anyway,
there is something to be said

2205
01:38:59,636 --> 01:39:00,969
about moving through it

2206
01:39:00,970 --> 01:39:04,473
and focusing on us
and not on the affair.

2207
01:39:04,474 --> 01:39:07,208
I don't want to give up on him.

2208
01:39:07,209 --> 01:39:10,213
I know him,
and I know he knows better.

2209
01:39:11,547 --> 01:39:13,382
But I am only human,

2210
01:39:13,383 --> 01:39:16,887
and I am so mad at him.

2211
01:39:18,187 --> 01:39:20,256
You know, so much
has happened to us so fast.

2212
01:39:20,257 --> 01:39:22,490
I think...

2213
01:39:22,491 --> 01:39:23,925
Part of me
was even expecting this.

2214
01:39:23,926 --> 01:39:25,961
Like, you know, he was
the more successful one

2215
01:39:25,962 --> 01:39:27,930
- when we started out.
- No, I didn't know that.

2216
01:39:27,931 --> 01:39:30,132
Yeah, he was.
He was a rising star.

2217
01:39:30,133 --> 01:39:32,267
And he bowed out
so that I could do this.

2218
01:39:32,268 --> 01:39:34,436
He was amazing.

2219
01:39:34,437 --> 01:39:36,206
It was all his idea.

2220
01:39:37,274 --> 01:39:38,873
I'm sure that's why
I'm even considering

2221
01:39:38,874 --> 01:39:40,142
this whole CEO thing,

2222
01:39:40,143 --> 01:39:43,545
thinking maybe
someone else coming in

2223
01:39:43,546 --> 01:39:45,347
will help me
get my life back on track.

2224
01:39:45,348 --> 01:39:46,781
Okay, that...
that's it.

2225
01:39:46,782 --> 01:39:48,851
I hate to be the feminist here,
between the two of us,

2226
01:39:48,852 --> 01:39:51,486
but you should be able to have
a huge career and be who you are

2227
01:39:51,487 --> 01:39:54,222
without having to accept that
your husband is having an affair

2228
01:39:54,223 --> 01:39:55,423
as some kind of payback.

2229
01:39:55,424 --> 01:39:56,591
Right on.

2230
01:39:56,592 --> 01:39:57,592
I mean it.

2231
01:39:57,593 --> 01:39:59,628
Me, too.

2232
01:39:59,629 --> 01:40:00,962
But such is life, my friend.

2233
01:40:00,963 --> 01:40:02,331
No, it isn't.
Not always.

2234
01:40:02,332 --> 01:40:04,299
And I'm not so sure
I'd be so forgiving.

2235
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:05,801
I am not so forgiving.

2236
01:40:05,802 --> 01:40:07,803
I'm saying that I could
potentially be forgiving.

2237
01:40:07,804 --> 01:40:10,505
But don't think that I
don't feel what's going on here.

2238
01:40:10,506 --> 01:40:12,541
It's crushing.

2239
01:40:12,542 --> 01:40:14,776
And when I think of Paige...

2240
01:40:14,777 --> 01:40:16,779
Oh, don't.

2241
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:20,849
Also, if we got divorced,
he'd remarry.

2242
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:23,887
Maybe not to this girl,
but someone.

2243
01:40:26,589 --> 01:40:28,992
And we both know I'm not easy.

2244
01:40:30,326 --> 01:40:33,828
So I could be, like, single
forever, which means that...

2245
01:40:33,829 --> 01:40:36,198
Forgive me, but this does

2246
01:40:36,199 --> 01:40:39,067
keep me up
in the middle of the night.

2247
01:40:39,068 --> 01:40:40,168
Oh.

2248
01:40:40,169 --> 01:40:41,570
What?

2249
01:40:41,571 --> 01:40:44,105
That I don't want to
be buried alone.

2250
01:40:44,106 --> 01:40:45,507
Paige'll be with her husband,

2251
01:40:45,508 --> 01:40:46,808
and Matt'll be
with his new family,

2252
01:40:46,809 --> 01:40:48,444
and I will be
buried with strangers.

2253
01:40:48,445 --> 01:40:52,314
I will buried in the strangers
singles section of the cemetery.

2254
01:40:52,315 --> 01:40:55,718
Not that that is a reason
to stay together.

2255
01:40:55,719 --> 01:40:59,021
But it's just, you know,
a scary sidebar.

2256
01:40:59,022 --> 01:41:01,957
Let's take that one
off your plate right now.

2257
01:41:01,958 --> 01:41:03,859
You can be buried with
me and Molly.

2258
01:41:03,860 --> 01:41:06,127
I happen to have space, okay?

2259
01:41:06,128 --> 01:41:08,663
Oh.

2260
01:41:08,664 --> 01:41:12,167
Thank you so much.
That is...

2261
01:41:12,168 --> 01:41:14,670
And to think
I didn't even want to hire you.

2262
01:41:14,671 --> 01:41:16,938
The one time
I don't have my hanky.

2263
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:27,382
You want to...

2264
01:41:27,383 --> 01:41:29,684
Watch TV?

2265
01:41:29,685 --> 01:41:31,519
Just for a few minutes?

2266
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,223
Yeah, sure, I would.

2267
01:41:37,493 --> 01:41:39,394
Even though
the planned merger has...

2268
01:43:28,037 --> 01:43:29,539
Airport, please.

2269
01:43:40,749 --> 01:43:43,317
So, did we like him?

2270
01:43:43,318 --> 01:43:46,254
He said all the right things.

2271
01:43:46,255 --> 01:43:49,557
He said that no one knows
about the fit like me.

2272
01:43:49,558 --> 01:43:53,328
That he doesn't want to remove
the soul of the company.

2273
01:43:53,329 --> 01:43:55,297
He said that
he doesn't have a plan.

2274
01:43:55,298 --> 01:43:58,333
He wants to watch us
and see what works.

2275
01:43:58,334 --> 01:44:02,806
He was polite and respectful
and super smart.

2276
01:44:03,872 --> 01:44:05,542
And I hired him.

2277
01:44:07,376 --> 01:44:08,543
Seriously?

2278
01:44:08,544 --> 01:44:10,045
Yeah.

2279
01:44:10,046 --> 01:44:11,546
You did it right in the room?

2280
01:44:11,547 --> 01:44:14,082
He told me to sleep on it
and that we'd talk tomorrow,

2281
01:44:14,083 --> 01:44:17,084
but I said the job was his.

2282
01:44:17,085 --> 01:44:19,754
We shook hands on it.

2283
01:44:19,755 --> 01:44:24,860
You know if, uh, we disagree,
he's the tiebreaker?

2284
01:44:24,861 --> 01:44:27,462
Of course.
He's the CEO.

2285
01:44:27,463 --> 01:44:30,433
Yeah. Duh.

2286
01:44:46,482 --> 01:44:47,582
Hi.

2287
01:44:47,583 --> 01:44:49,319
Hey!

2288
01:44:54,156 --> 01:44:55,556
You smell minty.

2289
01:44:55,557 --> 01:44:57,492
I just made mint tea.

2290
01:44:57,493 --> 01:45:00,262
So...

2291
01:45:00,263 --> 01:45:02,332
Yes? No?

2292
01:45:03,699 --> 01:45:04,999
I did it.

2293
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,835
I liked him.
A lot.

2294
01:45:06,836 --> 01:45:09,771
And, uh...
I offered him the job.

2295
01:45:09,772 --> 01:45:11,873
Wow. Really?

2296
01:45:11,874 --> 01:45:13,908
Yeah.

2297
01:45:13,909 --> 01:45:16,378
And you're okay with it?

2298
01:45:16,379 --> 01:45:18,313
Yeah.

2299
01:45:18,314 --> 01:45:20,917
I think it'll be good for us.

2300
01:45:28,557 --> 01:45:33,562
Do we have any, like, real
booze, like vodka or something?

2301
01:45:33,563 --> 01:45:35,031
Yeah.

2302
01:45:44,307 --> 01:45:47,842
Did "good for us" mean...

2303
01:45:47,843 --> 01:45:49,678
About the fit...

2304
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:52,947
Or us?

2305
01:45:52,948 --> 01:45:55,184
You-and-me us.

2306
01:45:57,987 --> 01:46:00,822
I figure if someone else can
call some of the shots at work,

2307
01:46:00,823 --> 01:46:02,657
then maybe...

2308
01:46:02,658 --> 01:46:05,461
We can get back to
where we were 18 months ago.

2309
01:46:06,762 --> 01:46:09,096
They say you can't put the genie
back in the bottle,

2310
01:46:09,097 --> 01:46:11,334
but we can try, right?

2311
01:47:27,976 --> 01:47:29,410
Hey!

2312
01:47:29,411 --> 01:47:30,678
Hi.

2313
01:47:30,679 --> 01:47:31,947
Wait, you live here?

2314
01:47:31,948 --> 01:47:34,382
Yeah, Ben's been putting me up
until I can find a place.

2315
01:47:34,383 --> 01:47:36,184
Oh, should I let him know
that you're here?

2316
01:47:36,185 --> 01:47:37,719
That's okay.
I'll ring.

2317
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:39,288
Okay.

2318
01:47:44,894 --> 01:47:46,161
Fiona?!

2319
01:47:46,162 --> 01:47:47,729
Jules!

2320
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:49,098
Come on in.

2321
01:47:52,268 --> 01:47:54,635
I'm just on my way to work.

2322
01:47:54,636 --> 01:47:56,539
Ben's right in here.

2323
01:48:03,211 --> 01:48:05,214
I'll let you two talk.

2324
01:48:07,984 --> 01:48:09,550
- See you.
- Mm-hmm.

2325
01:48:09,551 --> 01:48:11,385
Hi.

2326
01:48:11,386 --> 01:48:12,553
Wow.

2327
01:48:12,554 --> 01:48:14,723
You and Fiona, huh?
Who knew.

2328
01:48:14,724 --> 01:48:16,291
She's a great gal.

2329
01:48:16,292 --> 01:48:19,827
She surprised me last night.
She brought over dinner.

2330
01:48:19,828 --> 01:48:21,396
It's brand-new.

2331
01:48:21,397 --> 01:48:24,666
Congratulations.
I love her.

2332
01:48:24,667 --> 01:48:26,536
Yeah.

2333
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:34,876
So, I was ready kind of early
this morning, since about 4:00,

2334
01:48:34,877 --> 01:48:37,345
and Matt and Paige left an hour
ago for a field trip

2335
01:48:37,346 --> 01:48:39,414
so I thought I'd come by.
I hope that's okay.

2336
01:48:39,415 --> 01:48:40,982
Yeah.

2337
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:46,020
I just wanted to say...

2338
01:48:46,021 --> 01:48:48,523
I slept on it.

2339
01:48:48,524 --> 01:48:51,459
I haven't called Townsend
yet, but...

2340
01:48:51,460 --> 01:48:54,664
I still feel like
it's the right thing to do.

2341
01:48:57,166 --> 01:48:59,601
Well...

2342
01:48:59,602 --> 01:49:02,703
I didn't sleep so well myself.

2343
01:49:02,704 --> 01:49:04,239
Over this?

2344
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:06,374
You remember the day
I drove you to the warehouse?

2345
01:49:06,375 --> 01:49:08,376
You were giving me the
wrong directions and all that?

2346
01:49:08,377 --> 01:49:09,745
Yeah. I remember.

2347
01:49:11,046 --> 01:49:12,480
Okay, well, I stood in the back,

2348
01:49:12,481 --> 01:49:14,015
and I watched you
show the workers

2349
01:49:14,016 --> 01:49:16,250
how to fold and box the clothes.

2350
01:49:16,251 --> 01:49:19,553
I knew then
that was why atf was a success.

2351
01:49:19,554 --> 01:49:20,888
No one else is ever gonna have

2352
01:49:20,889 --> 01:49:24,159
that kind of commitment
to your company, Jules.

2353
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:26,661
To me, it's pretty simple.

2354
01:49:26,662 --> 01:49:29,197
About the fit needs you,
and if you don't mind me saying,

2355
01:49:29,198 --> 01:49:30,631
you need it.

2356
01:49:30,632 --> 01:49:32,867
Someone may come in
with more experience than you,

2357
01:49:32,868 --> 01:49:35,837
but they're never gonna know
what you know.

2358
01:49:35,838 --> 01:49:38,172
I never had anything like this
in my life.

2359
01:49:38,173 --> 01:49:39,941
Not many people do.

2360
01:49:39,942 --> 01:49:43,912
This big, beautiful,
exciting thing that you created.

2361
01:49:43,913 --> 01:49:46,280
It's a dream, isn't it?

2362
01:49:46,281 --> 01:49:47,782
And you're gonna give that up

2363
01:49:47,783 --> 01:49:51,252
in the hopes that your husband
will stop having an affair?

2364
01:49:51,253 --> 01:49:53,821
I don't see how that adds up.

2365
01:49:53,822 --> 01:49:56,924
You should feel nothing but
great about what you've done.

2366
01:49:56,925 --> 01:50:00,596
And I'd hate to see you let
anyone take that away from you.

2367
01:50:06,302 --> 01:50:07,569
I guess you came over here

2368
01:50:07,570 --> 01:50:10,538
because you wanted to hear
some of this.

2369
01:50:10,539 --> 01:50:12,139
Yes.

2370
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:14,842
And maybe also
because you're my...

2371
01:50:14,843 --> 01:50:16,245
Intern.

2372
01:50:17,613 --> 01:50:22,318
Well, I was gonna say
intern/best friend.

2373
01:50:23,552 --> 01:50:25,887
But there's no need to get
all sentimental about it

2374
01:50:25,888 --> 01:50:28,656
even though we could potentially
be buried together.

2375
01:50:28,657 --> 01:50:30,691
Can't get closer than that.

2376
01:50:34,430 --> 01:50:35,763
It's Moments like this
when you need

2377
01:50:35,764 --> 01:50:37,798
someone you know
you can count on.

2378
01:50:37,799 --> 01:50:39,268
So thank you.

2379
01:50:42,238 --> 01:50:44,739
I like your house
so much by the way.

2380
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:46,576
Thanks.

2381
01:50:51,013 --> 01:50:52,815
So?

2382
01:51:07,963 --> 01:51:09,797
Shall we?

2383
01:51:09,798 --> 01:51:11,534
Okay.

2384
01:51:17,239 --> 01:51:19,474
Welcome back, you two.

2385
01:51:19,475 --> 01:51:21,175
Jules, I have something cool
to show you.

2386
01:51:21,176 --> 01:51:23,077
Do you remember taking
a customer-service call

2387
01:51:23,078 --> 01:51:25,880
about a bride whose bridesmaids'
dresses showed up in gray,

2388
01:51:25,881 --> 01:51:27,348
and we had the vendor
remake them overnight

2389
01:51:27,349 --> 01:51:28,550
and put them on a plane?

2390
01:51:28,551 --> 01:51:30,351
Yeah. Yeah.
Rachel.

2391
01:51:30,352 --> 01:51:32,087
Check this out.

2392
01:51:33,856 --> 01:51:36,023
The silk Chiffon
Antoinette dress.

2393
01:51:36,024 --> 01:51:38,426
They look beautiful.

2394
01:51:38,427 --> 01:51:41,530
Oh, and these just arrived
from Mark Townsend.

2395
01:51:43,833 --> 01:51:45,368
- Here.
- Thanks.

2396
01:51:55,677 --> 01:51:57,812
Becky? Give me Townsend's
number, will you?

2397
01:51:57,813 --> 01:51:59,580
Okay.

2398
01:52:01,884 --> 01:52:03,284
This is Jules.

2399
01:52:03,285 --> 01:52:05,386
Hey, Alonzo, what's up?

2400
01:52:05,387 --> 01:52:06,987
Uh-huh. Okay.

2401
01:52:06,988 --> 01:52:09,625
Do we need that many?

2402
01:52:15,264 --> 01:52:17,265
I hope I'm not too late.

2403
01:52:17,266 --> 01:52:19,067
Don't do this for me, Jules.

2404
01:52:19,068 --> 01:52:20,201
Please?

2405
01:52:20,202 --> 01:52:22,170
Just do what feels right
for you.

2406
01:52:22,171 --> 01:52:24,073
Oh, my God.

2407
01:52:26,641 --> 01:52:29,644
I want to continue running
my company, Matt.

2408
01:52:29,645 --> 01:52:31,078
You got to know that.

2409
01:52:31,079 --> 01:52:34,081
Then do it.
I don't want you to be unhappy.

2410
01:52:34,082 --> 01:52:36,686
I'm already unhappy.

2411
01:52:39,221 --> 01:52:40,788
I need to tell you something.

2412
01:52:40,789 --> 01:52:42,491
I know.

2413
01:52:43,425 --> 01:52:45,493
Just tell me, is it almost over?

2414
01:52:45,494 --> 01:52:47,428
I don't know
how much longer I can...

2415
01:52:47,429 --> 01:52:49,663
it's over.

2416
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:54,702
I can't tell you
how s-sorry and ashamed I am.

2417
01:52:54,703 --> 01:52:57,638
I thought I could do it.

2418
01:52:57,639 --> 01:52:59,908
I thought I could be
the guy that I told you

2419
01:52:59,909 --> 01:53:01,942
I was going to be.

2420
01:53:01,943 --> 01:53:05,514
And then
somewhere along the way...

2421
01:53:07,349 --> 01:53:09,352
I thought I was losing you.

2422
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:14,956
But it was actually me.

2423
01:53:14,957 --> 01:53:16,724
I got lost.

2424
01:53:16,725 --> 01:53:18,660
It's a confusing world
out there,

2425
01:53:18,661 --> 01:53:21,463
and who I am
got messed up for a minute.

2426
01:53:21,464 --> 01:53:27,502
And now I'm watching you ready
to give all this up for me.

2427
01:53:27,503 --> 01:53:30,772
I will not let that happen.

2428
01:53:30,773 --> 01:53:35,910
I love you, and I will do so
much better if you'll let me.

2429
01:53:41,483 --> 01:53:43,417
Please, Jules.

2430
01:53:43,418 --> 01:53:46,989
Let me make it right again.

2431
01:53:56,665 --> 01:53:58,834
You know what would be good?

2432
01:54:00,302 --> 01:54:02,538
If you carried a handkerchief.

2433
01:54:16,818 --> 01:54:19,420
Have you called Townsend yet?

2434
01:54:19,421 --> 01:54:22,257
Because if I've ever met anyone
who doesn't need a Boss,

2435
01:54:22,258 --> 01:54:23,926
it was you.

2436
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:28,931
I was just about to call him
and tell him I changed my mind.

2437
01:54:30,465 --> 01:54:32,433
I mean, we're good here.

2438
01:54:32,434 --> 01:54:34,669
We're gonna make it.

2439
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:36,237
I'm gonna make sure we make it.

2440
01:54:36,238 --> 01:54:37,972
Good.

2441
01:55:00,596 --> 01:55:02,129
Becky.

2442
01:55:02,130 --> 01:55:03,564
Where's Ben?

2443
01:55:03,565 --> 01:55:07,002
I'm not sure. He said
he was taking the day off.

2444
01:55:11,907 --> 01:55:13,641
Fiona.

2445
01:55:13,642 --> 01:55:15,376
Do you know where Ben is?

2446
01:55:48,243 --> 01:55:49,644
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

2447
01:55:49,645 --> 01:55:52,079
That's okay.

2448
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:55,149
Extend your left arm, Jules.

2449
01:55:55,150 --> 01:55:57,785
Left knee up...

2450
01:55:57,786 --> 01:56:01,823
Breathe and relax
for inner balance.

2451
01:56:01,824 --> 01:56:04,592
- Am I doing it right?
- Almost.

2452
01:56:04,593 --> 01:56:06,027
Got something good to tell you.

2453
01:56:06,028 --> 01:56:08,097
Great.
Tell me when we're done.

2454
01:56:11,700 --> 01:56:14,637
Breathe deeply, Jules.

2455
01:56:19,575 --> 01:56:21,709
That's it, out there.

2456
01:56:21,710 --> 01:56:24,145
This up.
