1
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,268
You're live in two minutes,
Your Royal Highness.

2
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,605
Sir?

3
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,611
Thank you.

4
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,658
Let the microphone do the work, sir.

5
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,706
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
Just take your time.

6
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,177
Time to go.

7
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,519
Good afternoon.

8
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:28,523
This is the BBC National Programme
and Empire Service

9
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,818
taking you to Wembley Stadium
for the closing ceremony

10
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,820
of the Empire Exhibition,

11
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,823
<i>where His Royal Highness,
the Duke of York,</i>

12
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:41,787
<i>will read a message from his father,
His Majesty King George V.</i>

13
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,165
<i>Fifty-eight British colonies
and dominions have taken part,</i>

14
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:49,336
<i>making this the largest exhibition
staged anywhere in the world.</i>

15
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,173
Remember, sir, three flashes,
then steady red means you're live.

16
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,384
<i>Using the new invention of radio,</i>

17
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:58,679
<i>the opening ceremony was the first time
His Majesty the King</i>

18
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,682
addressed his subjects on the wireless.

19
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,059
<i>At the close of the first season,</i>

20
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,354
<i>the heir to the throne,
His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales,</i>

21
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,274
<i>made his first broadcast, and today,</i>

22
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,861
his younger brother,
His Royal Highness, the Duke of York,

23
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:19,074
will give his inaugural broadcast
to the nation and the world.

24
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,474
I have received...

25
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:38,111
...from His Majesty the...

26
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,664
...the...

27
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,417
...the...

28
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,589
...the King...

29
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:27,369
Inhale deep into your lungs,
Your Royal Highness.

30
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,373
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?

31
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:36,461
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves,
and gives you confidence.

32
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:42,551
Now, if Your Royal Highness
would be so kind as to open your hand.

33
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,269
Sterilized.

34
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,313
One, two,

35
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,650
three, four,

36
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,237
five, six...

37
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,158
...seven. Now, if I may take the
liberty, insert them into your mouth.

38
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,831
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?

39
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,209
It's the classic approach.
It cured Demosthenes.

40
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,379
That was in Ancient Greece.
Has it worked since?

41
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:25,427
Now, if you would be
so kind as to read.

42
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,846
"A wealth of words."

43
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,606
Fight against those marbles,
Your Royal Highness.

44
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,235
Enunciate.

45
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:49,659
A little more concentration,
Your Royal Highness.

46
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,498
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!

47
00:06:56,207 --> 00:07:00,253
Thank you so much, Doctor.
It's been most, um...

48
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,048
- ...interesting.
- Your Royal Highness.

49
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:10,305
Insert marbles.
He can insert his own bloody marbles.

50
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,688
Tick, tock. Tick, tock.

51
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,859
You know you can't
keep doing this, Bertie.

52
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,031
- I know.
- Mmm.

53
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,119
Promise me...

54
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,789
Promise me no more.

55
00:07:35,789 --> 00:08:05,789
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

56
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,888
Ah!

57
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,502
Hello?

58
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,882
- Is anyone there?
- I'm just in the loo.

59
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,770
Ah, Mrs. Johnson, there you are.

60
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:25,231
I'm sorry, I don't have a receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.

61
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:28,068
"Poor and content
is rich and rich enough."

62
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,945
- I'm sorry?
- Shakespeare. How are you?

63
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,575
- How do you do?
- Oh, chuff tog along.

64
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,412
Um, now, this is slightly awkward,
but I'm afraid you're late.

65
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,917
- Yes. I'm afraid I am.
- Where's Mr. Johnson?

66
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,045
Ah... He doesn't know I'm here.

67
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,380
Well, that's not a very promising start.

68
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:55,053
No. No, look,
my husband has seen everyone.

69
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,764
To no avail.
I'm awfully afraid he's given up hope.

70
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,267
- He hasn't seen me.
- Awfully sure of yourself.

71
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,895
Well, I'm sure of anyone
who wants to be cured.

72
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:08,066
Of course he wants to be cured.
My husband is, um...

73
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,070
- Well, he's required to speak publicly.
- Perhaps he should change jobs.

74
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:16,199
- He can't.
- Indentured servitude?

75
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,202
Something of that nature, yes.

76
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,413
Well, we need to have your hubby pop by.

77
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,291
Uh... Tuesday would be good.

78
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,211
He can give me his personal details,
I'll make a frank appraisal

79
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,880
- and then we'll take it from there.
- Doctor, forgive me.

80
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,008
Uh, I don't have a "hubby."
We don't "pop."

81
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,470
And nor do we ever talk about
our private lives.

82
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,597
No, you must come to us.

83
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,976
I'm sorry, Mrs. Johnson,
my game, my turf, my rules.

84
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,185
Mmm.

85
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,979
You'll have to talk this over
with your husband,

86
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,439
and then you can speak to me
on the telephone.

87
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:52,110
Thank you very much for dropping by.
Good afternoon.

88
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,032
And what if my husband
were the Duke of York?

89
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:02,453
- The Duke of York?
- Yes. The Duke of York.

90
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,633
I thought the appointment
was for Johnson. Forgive me, Your...

91
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,844
- Royal Highness.
- ...Royal Highness.

92
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,264
Yes, Johnson was used during the Great
War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy

93
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,018
- to know he was aboard.
- Am I considered the enemy?

94
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,854
You will be, if you remain un-obliging.

95
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,441
You'll appreciate the need
for absolute discretion.

96
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,610
Of course.

97
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,613
How did you find me,
Your Royal Highness?

98
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,699
The President of The Society
For Speech Therapists.

99
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,577
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.

100
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,662
She warned me your Antipodean methods

101
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:48,041
were both "unorthodox"
and "controversial."

102
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,836
I warned her those
are not my favorite words.

103
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,547
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work,

104
00:11:54,631 --> 00:12:00,386
I need trust and total equality, here
in the safety of my consultation room.

105
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,430
No exceptions.

106
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,976
Oh, well. In that case...

107
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,069
When can you start?

108
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,290
- She's still sounding a bit rough.
- You make me drive too slowly, Dad.

109
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:33,086
- Did you pick Mum up from bridge?
- Yeah, I've hardly been out of the car.

110
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,381
I had a special visitor this afternoon.

111
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,342
- May I please leave the table?
- How special's special?

112
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,887
You must stay, bored stupid, listening
to your parents' inane conversation.

113
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,180
- Thanks, Dad.
- And Mum.

114
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,556
- And Mum.
- Me, too.

115
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,185
- You meeting Jean?
- No. Someone else.

116
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,398
- Doctor? Doctor?
- Hmm?

117
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,233
Go and help your brother
with the washing up.

118
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,027
- I'm fine.
- Who is it, Lionel?

119
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,406
Why bring it up
if you can't talk about it?

120
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:06,119
Myrtle, it's just a woman
looking to help her husband.

121
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,789
Oh, and I had a call... for an audition.

122
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,833
- One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?

123
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,377
Could be a lot of fun.

124
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,462
I'm sure you'll be splendid.

125
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,549
In the amateur scene,
they're a highly regarded group.

126
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,468
From Putney.

127
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,972
No, that's all girls.
Tomorrow, chapter four, "The Flight."

128
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,975
Mama,
I long to know where they fly to.

129
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,477
- I can't wait!
- Oh, to fly away.

130
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,896
Weren't they lucky?

131
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,857
Now Papa, tell a story.

132
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,531
Can't I be a penguin instead?

133
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,954
Well, no, I want a penguin story.

134
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,876
Very quickly.

135
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,006
Once there were...
two princesses.

136
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,176
Princess Elizabeth
and Princess Margaret,

137
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,762
whose papa was a penguin.

138
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,476
This was because he'd been
turned into one by a wicked witch.

139
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,272
This was very inconvenient for him
because he loved...

140
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,194
...to hold his princesses in his arms.

141
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,946
But you can't if you're a penguin
because you...

142
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:28,868
- ...you have wings like herrings.
- Herrings don't have wings.

143
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:33,206
Penguins have wings which are...
are shaped like herrings.

144
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:40,713
And what made matters worse is that
she... she sent him to the South Pole,

145
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,633
which is an awfully long walk back if...

146
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,010
...if you can't fly.

147
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:49,555
So when he reached the water, he...

148
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,682
...he dived in, through the depths,

149
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:55,144
so fast that he was in
Southampton Waters by lunchtime.

150
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,065
And from there,
he took the 2:30 to Weybridge,

151
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,735
changed at Clapham Junction, asked a...

152
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,238
...a passing mallard the way
to Buckingham Palace,

153
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,408
swam up The Thames,
out through the plughole

154
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:13,413
and gave the cook, Mama
and Mrs. Whittaker quite a shock.

155
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,582
Now, when the girls
heard all the commotion,

156
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,752
they ran to the kitchen,
where they gave him a...

157
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,922
...a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.

158
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,967
And as they kissed him...

159
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,511
...guess what he turned into?

160
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,348
- A handsome prince.
- A short-tailed albatross.

161
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:36,144
- Oh.
- With wings so big,

162
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:41,441
that he could wrap them both around
his two girls together.

163
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,776
Now, girls. Time for bed. Come on.

164
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,820
- And take those horses to the stable.
- Quickly, now.

165
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,989
- You have exactly a minute.
- Good night.

166
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,116
Feed them, brush them and to bed.

167
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:55,371
- Will Mrs. Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.

168
00:15:56,497 --> 00:16:01,294
- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?

169
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,796
No. About her.

170
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,343
- A married woman? He can't be.
- She can.

171
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,763
By the way, I think I've found
someone rather interesting.

172
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,390
On Harley Street. Doctor.

173
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,684
Out of the question.

174
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:20,313
I'm not having this conversation again.
Mat... Matter's settled.

175
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,148
Mmm. His approach
seems rather different.

176
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,402
Now?

177
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,405
Now.

178
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,290
Now is the winter of our discontent,

179
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:44,170
made glorious summer
by this sun of York.

180
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,964
And all the clouds
that lour'd upon our house

181
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,675
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

182
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,971
Now are our brows bound
with... victorious...

183
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,765
Thank you.

184
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,522
- Lovely diction, Mr...
- Logue. Lionel Logue.

185
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,233
Well, Mr. Logue,

186
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:09,195
I'm not hearing the cries
of a deformed creature

187
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,906
yearning to be king.

188
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:16,536
Nor did I realize Richard Ill
was King of the Colonies.

189
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:23,251
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.

190
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,044
- Sydney?
- Perth.

191
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,296
Major theater town, is it?

192
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,341
- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.

193
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,177
I was well reviewed.

194
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,222
Yes.

195
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:42,311
Well, Lionel,
I think our dramatic society

196
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,523
is looking for someone slightly younger.

197
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:51,070
And a... little more regal.

198
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,326
- There you are.
- Thank you.

199
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,248
- Oh.
- Mmm.

200
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,667
No, you have to shut that one first.

201
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,795
Close that one first. That's it.

202
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,841
Where did you find this... physician?

203
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,678
Classifieds. Next to a
"French model, Shepherd's Market."

204
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,263
No, he comes highly recommended.

205
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,557
Charges substantial fees
to help the poor.

206
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,560
Oh, dear. Perhaps he's a Bolshevik.

207
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,608
Ah, there's no receptionist.
Likes to keep things simple.

208
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:34,196
Uh... The Johnsons.

209
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,628
You can go in now, Mr. Johnson.

210
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:53,424
Lionel says wait here
if you wish, Mrs. Johnson.

211
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,594
Or, it being a...

212
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,806
...pleasant day...

213
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,271
...perhaps take a stroll.

214
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,734
Was that all right, Lionel?

215
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,738
Marvelous, Willie.

216
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,115
You can stay here and wait for your mum.

217
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,368
Mrs. Johnson.

218
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,330
Mr. Johnson. Do come in.

219
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,684
Would you like a sweetie?

220
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,186
He's a good lad, Willie.

221
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,564
He could hardly make a sound, you know,
when he first came to me.

222
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,867
My boys make those.
They're good, aren't they?

223
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,287
Please, make yourself comfortable.

224
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,265
I was told not to sit too close.

225
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,524
I believe when speaking with a prince,

226
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,527
one waits for the prince
to choose the topic.

227
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,577
Waiting for me to...

228
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,833
...commence a conversation,
one can wait rather a long wait.

229
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,836
Ah, yes, well...

230
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,260
Do you know any jokes?

231
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:13,773
- Timing isn't my strong suit.
- Cup of tea?

232
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:18,068
- No. No, thank you.
- I think I'll have one.

233
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,709
Aren't you going to start treating me,
Dr. Logue?

234
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,837
Only if you're interested
in being treated.

235
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:40,591
Please, call me Lionel.

236
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,928
No, I... prefer Doctor.

237
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,555
I prefer Lionel.

238
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,143
- What will I call you?
- Your Royal Highness.

239
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,897
Then... it's "sir" after that.

240
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,818
It's a little bit formal for here.
I prefer names.

241
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:03,948
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur...

242
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,115
...George.

243
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,117
How about Bertie?

244
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,499
- Only my family uses that.
- Perfect.

245
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:17,086
In here, it's better if we're equals.

246
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:25,803
If... if we were equals,
I wouldn't be here.

247
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:30,766
I'd be... at home with my wife,

248
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,977
and no one would give a damn.

249
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,187
Please, don't do that.

250
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,689
I'm sorry?

251
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,860
I believe sucking smoke into your lungs,
well, it will kill you.

252
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:44,446
My physicians say it relaxes the...

253
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,407
- ...the throat.
- They're idiots.

254
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,494
- They've all been knighted.
- Makes it official, then.

255
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,748
My castle, my rules.

256
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,254
Thank you.

257
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,382
What was your earliest memory?

258
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,720
- What on earth do you mean?
- Your first recollection.

259
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,305
I'm not...

260
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,018
...here to discuss personal matters.

261
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,646
- Well, why are you here, then?
- Because I bloody well stammer!

262
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:22,735
- You have a bit of a temper.
- One of my many faults.

263
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,697
- When did the defect start?
- I've always been this way.

264
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,949
- I doubt that.
- Don't...

265
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,077
- ...tell me, it's my stammer.
- It's my field.

266
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:36,165
I can assure you, no infant
starts to speak with a stammer.

267
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,250
When did yours start?

268
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,380
- Four or five.
- That's typical.

269
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,383
So I've been told.

270
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,053
I... I can't remember not doing it.

271
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,765
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?

272
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:57,186
- Don't be ridiculous.
- How about when you talk to yourself?

273
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,357
Everyone natters to themselves
occasionally, Bertie.

274
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,275
Stop... Stop calling me that.

275
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,735
I'm not going to call you anything else.

276
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:09,698
Then we shan't speak.

277
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,921
Are you charging for this, Doctor?

278
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,133
A fortune.

279
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,350
I'll just let that brew.

280
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:41,730
So... when you talk to yourself,
do you stammer?

281
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,484
No... of course not.

282
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,989
Well, that proves that your impediment
isn't a permanent part of you.

283
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,324
What do you think was the cause?

284
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,410
I don't... don't know.

285
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,955
I... I don't... I don't care.

286
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,708
I... I stammer.

287
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,003
No one can fix it.

288
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:08,716
I'll bet you that you can read
flawlessly, right here, right now.

289
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,927
And if I win the bet,
I get to ask you more questions.

290
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,930
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer them.

291
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:19,643
One usually... wagers money.

292
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:22,104
A bob each to keep it sweet?

293
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:27,276
- Let's see your shilling.
- I don't... carry money.

294
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,820
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.

295
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,365
I'll stake you, and you can
pay me back next time.

296
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:37,453
- If there is a next time.
- I haven't agreed to take you on yet.

297
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,001
So please stand, uh,
and take a look at that.

298
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,295
From there.

299
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,053
I... I can't read this.

300
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,638
Well, then you owe me
a shilling for not trying.

301
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,986
To be...

302
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,323
...or not to be, that...

303
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:23,332
- Can't read it.
- Uh-uh-uh! I haven't finished yet.

304
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:36,845
I'm going to record your voice and then
play it back to you on the same machine.

305
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,182
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing from America.

306
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,725
It's a Silvertone.

307
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,239
Pop these on.

308
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,327
There's a bob in this, mate.
You could go home rich.

309
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,589
- You're playing music!
- I know.

310
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,299
So how can I hear what I'm saying?

311
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,970
Well, surely a prince's brain
knows what its mouth's doing?

312
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:22,474
You're not... well acquainted
with royal princes, are you?

313
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,887
Hopeless.

314
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,138
Hopeless!

315
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,017
You were sublime.

316
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,188
Would I lie to a prince of the realm
to win 12 pennies?

317
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,731
I've no idea...

318
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,859
...what an Australian
might do for that sort of money.

319
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,944
Let me play it back to you.

320
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,280
No.

321
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,532
All right, then, well,
I get to ask you the questions.

322
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:24,077
Thank you, Doctor. I don't...

323
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,163
...feel this is for me.

324
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,211
Thank you for your time.

325
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,172
Goodbye.

326
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,841
Sir.

327
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:47,768
The recording is free.
Please keep it as a souvenir.

328
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,950
No.

329
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,082
Oh, well.

330
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,379
Bugger.

331
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:23,845
<i>For the present, the work
to which we are all equally bound</i>

332
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:28,183
<i>is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility
within our borders,</i>

333
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:32,521
to regain prosperity
at this time of depression

334
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,774
without self-seeking,
and to carry with us

335
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,986
those whom the burden of the past years

336
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,197
has disheartened or overborne.

337
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:47,744
To all, to each,
I wish a happy Christmas.

338
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,871
God bless you.

339
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,375
And off air.

340
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,130
Easy when you know how.

341
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,173
Sir?

342
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,766
Have a go yourself.

343
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,060
- Congratulations, sir.
- Ah, Mr. Wood.

344
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,647
Splendid fellow.
Chap who taught me everything I know.

345
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,984
- Let the microphone do the work.
- Sir.

346
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,486
- Thank you.
- Gentlemen.

347
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,572
Sit up. Straight back.

348
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,783
Face boldly up to the bloody thing
and stare it square in the eye,

349
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,995
as would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.

350
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,665
Papa, I don't... think I can read this.

351
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:37,169
This devilish device will change
everything if you don't.

352
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,672
In the past, all a king had to do
was look respectable in uniform

353
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,632
and not fall off his horse.

354
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:46,345
Now, we must invade people's homes
and ingratiate ourselves with them.

355
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:51,016
This family's been reduced to those
lowest, basest of all creatures.

356
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,851
We've become actors.

357
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,979
We're not a family, we're a firm.

358
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:59,024
Yet at any moment,
some of us may be out of work.

359
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:02,027
Your darling brother and future king,

360
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,822
the only wife he appears interested in
is invariably the wife of another.

361
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:09,868
- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
- And taken up with Mrs. Simpson.

362
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,372
A woman with two husbands living.
I told him straight.

363
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:17,000
No divorced person
can ever be received at court.

364
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:22,047
He said it made him
sublimely happy.

365
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,842
I imagine that was
because she was sleeping with him.

366
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,719
"I give you my word,"
this is what he said.

367
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:32,349
"I give you my word,
we've never had immoral relations."

368
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:36,520
Stared square into
his father's face and lied.

369
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,855
When I'm dead,
that boy will ruin himself,

370
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,233
this family and this nation
within 12 months.

371
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:45,737
Who will pick up the pieces, hmm?
Herr Hitler intimidating half of Europe.

372
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,073
Marshal Stalin the other half.

373
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,450
Who will stand between us,

374
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:54,579
the jackboots
and the proletarian abyss?

375
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,124
You?

376
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,586
Well?

377
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,256
With your older brother
shirking his duties,

378
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,842
you're going to have to do
a lot more of this.

379
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,719
Have a go yourself.

380
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,437
Through the...

381
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,397
- ...wireless...
- Get it out, boy.

382
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,858
...one of the...

383
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,693
...marvels of...

384
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:31,408
"Modern." Just take your time.
Form your words carefully.

385
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,243
...science...

386
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,913
...I am enabled...

387
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,707
Relax.

388
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,253
Just try it!

389
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,213
...this Christmas Day...

390
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,843
...to speak to all my...

391
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,179
Do it!

392
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,571
Lying... bastard.

393
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,218
<i>- You're playing music.
- I know.</i>

394
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:34,221
<i>So how can I...
hear what I'm saying?</i>

395
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,557
<i>Well, surely a prince's brain
knows what its mouth's doing.</i>

396
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:41,603
<i>You're not... well acquainted
with royal princes, are you?</i>

397
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,824
<i>"To be or not be,
that is the question.</i>

398
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,869
<i>Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer</i>

399
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:01,373
<i>the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,</i>

400
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,334
<i>or to take arms
against a sea of troubles,</i>

401
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,712
<i>and by opposing end them?</i>

402
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,924
<i>To die, to sleep no more,</i>

403
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,885
<i>and by a sleep to say the end</i>

404
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:17,055
<i>is the heartache
and the thousand natural shocks</i>

405
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:22,769
<i>the flesh is heir to.
Tis a consummation hopeless."</i>

406
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,729
<i>Hopeless!</i>

407
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,233
Strictly business. No...

408
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,280
- ...personal nonsense.
- Yes, I thought I'd made that clear

409
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,074
- in our interview.
- Have you got the shilling you owe me?

410
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,661
- No, I haven't.
- Didn't think so.

411
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,414
Besides, you... you tricked me.

412
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,083
Physical exercises
and tricks are important,

413
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,420
but what you're asking will only deal
with the surface of the problem.

414
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,589
Is that sufficient? Uh, no.

415
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:56,511
As far as I see it, my husband has
mechanical difficulties with his speech.

416
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,431
- I...
- Maybe just deal with that.

417
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,642
I...

418
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:07,188
- I'm willing to work hard, Dr. Logue.
- Lionel.

419
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:11,943
Are you...
Are you willing to do your part?

420
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,282
All right. You want mechanics?

421
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,535
We need to relax your jaw muscles,
strengthen your tongue,

422
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:24,331
by repeating tongue twisters.
For example, "I'm a thistle-sifter.

423
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:27,292
I have a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.

424
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,794
- Because I am a thistle-sifter."
- Fine.

425
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,964
And you do have a flabby tummy,
so we'll need to spend some time

426
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,759
strengthening your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.

427
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,053
- That's all we ask.
- All that's about a shilling's worth.

428
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,472
Forget about the blessed shilling!

429
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,905
Perhaps, upon occasions...

430
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,407
...you might be requested to assist...

431
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:06,164
...in coping with...

432
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,793
...with some minor event.
Would that be agreeable?

433
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,836
Of course.

434
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,590
Yes, and that would be the full extent
of your services.

435
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:19,678
- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.

436
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,601
Feel the looseness of the jaw.

437
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,731
Good. Little bounces. Bounces.

438
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,692
Shoulders loose, shoulders loose.

439
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,945
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Now, loose.

440
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,369
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest.

441
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,454
Put your hands onto your ribs.

442
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,666
Deeper. Good.

443
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,794
- How do you feel?
- Full of hot air.

444
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,255
Isn't that what
public speaking's all about?

445
00:36:55,338 --> 00:37:00,844
My wife and I are glad
to visit this important...

446
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,806
Take a good deep breath,
and up comes Your Royal Highness.

447
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:09,227
And slowly exhale,
and down comes Your Royal Highness.

448
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,521
- You all right, Bertie?
- Yes.

449
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,148
It's actually quite good fun.

450
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,941
Mmm... Mother.

451
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,651
Shorten
the humming each time.

452
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,903
Mother. Mmm...

453
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:22,407
- ...- manufacturing district...
<i>- Another deep breath.</i>

454
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,076
- And Jack and Jill.
- Jack and Jill.

455
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,995
- Went up the hill.
- Went up the hill.

456
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,747
Now, just sway.

457
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,249
Perfect.

458
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:35,128
- ...will not permit us to...
- Loosen the shoulders.

459
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,589
Ding dong bell,
pussy's in the well.

460
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:41,342
Who put her in? Little Tommy Tin.

461
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,223
You have a short memory, Bertie.
Come on.

462
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:53,271
- A cow, a cow...
- A king.

463
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,439
A... a king...

464
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,989
Anyone who can shout vowels at an open
window can learn to deliver a speech.

465
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,203
- Fourteen, 15!
<i>- Good. Deep breath, and...</i>

466
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,455
It is...

467
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,291
- Let the words flow.
- No, it doesn't bloody work.

468
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,294
<i>Come on, one more time, Bertie.
You can do it.</i>

469
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,630
A sieve of thisted siphles.

470
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:22,550
Gah! Mah! Bah!

471
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,604
<i>Father.</i>

472
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,939
<i>- Father.
- Father.</i>

473
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,732
- Aim for the a-t-h.
- Father.

474
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,193
- Father.
- Father.

475
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,404
Father. Father.

476
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:17,188
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello, David.

477
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:20,024
- Nice of you to come out.
- Not at all.

478
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,487
You been waiting long?

479
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,532
Christ, bloody freezing.

480
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,702
Where have you been?

481
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,622
- I've been busy.
- So have I.

482
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,252
- Elizabeth has pneumonia.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

483
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,547
- She'll recover.
- Father won't.

484
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,426
I'll drive.

485
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,015
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.

486
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:56,185
- Dying?
- Departing prematurely.

487
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:59,105
To... To complicate matters with Wallis.

488
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,985
For heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.

489
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:08,323
Wallis explained. She's terribly clever
about these things.

490
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,827
<i>Whereas my letters patent
under the Great Seal</i>

491
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:16,664
bearing date of Westminster
the 11th day of June 1912,

492
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:20,418
His Majesty King George the Fifth
did constitute order

493
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,211
and declare that there
should be a Guardian...

494
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,839
- What's going on here?
<i>- ...custos regne...</i>

495
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,760
I cannot follow you.
I'm confused and I don't understand...

496
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,763
It's the Order
of the Council of State, sir.

497
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:36,059
So that we may act on your behalf...

498
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,102
...much clearer to me, I'm afraid...

499
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:44,734
- Well, I'm so confused that...
- Approved.

500
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,444
Thank you.

501
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,831
- Let me help you, sir.
- Ah, yes...

502
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,047
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

503
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,680
- Feeling a little better, sir?
- No, I'm not feeling any better.

504
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:17,058
I feel dreadful. Ah...

505
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,729
Been, uh, ice skating? Ice skating?

506
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,564
No. No, George.

507
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,289
Yes. Yes, all right, of course.

508
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:43,209
I know, darling.
A talk, even a lovely long talk

509
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:47,255
is a poor substitute
for holding tight and making drowsy.

510
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:51,259
Nor making our own drowsies either,
as we've had to do too often lately.

511
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,178
- David. Dinner.
- I'm on with Wallis.

512
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,972
It's Bertie.

513
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:00,435
No. No, it's not important.

514
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:04,063
I don't want to.

515
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:07,400
No. Telephone me later?

516
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,694
All right, goodbye.

517
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:15,491
- Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.

518
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,960
She forgets Papa's bloody clocks
are all half an hour fast.

519
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,562
How's the King?
I... I hope he's not in pain.

520
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,440
No, no, sir.
His Majesty's quieter now.

521
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,152
Thank you.

522
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,619
David, if your father were here,
tardiness would not be tolerated.

523
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,665
None of this unpleasantness
would be tolerated.

524
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:11,339
You know, sir, I appreciate
that you are different from your father,

525
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:16,385
both in outlook and... temperament.

526
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:20,973
I want you to know that whenever
the King questioned your conduct,

527
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,851
I tried, in your interest,

528
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:27,063
to present it
in the most favorable light.

529
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:31,651
Mmm. I can always trust you
to have my best interests at heart.

530
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:50,711
I fear our vigil will not be
of long duration. Please continue.

531
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:08,271
Let us commend our brother George
to the mercy of God,

532
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,940
our Maker and Redeemer.

533
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,288
Long live the King.

534
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,554
I hope I will make good
as he has made good.

535
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:20,092
- What on earth was that?
- Poor Wallis.

536
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,179
Now, I'm trapped.

537
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:41,072
<i>And in these last 25
crowded, troubled, glorious years,</i>

538
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:44,951
<i>if there is one thing
that King George has taught,</i>

539
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:48,913
<i>it is the art of the leader who
is also a brother to his followers.</i>

540
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:54,585
<i>As long as he lived, he was
the guiding star of a great nation.</i>

541
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,254
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?

542
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,673
<i>- When he died...</i>
- Time for a Shake, Dad?

543
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,800
<i>...the little children
cried in the streets.</i>

544
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,386
- You sure?
- Go on.

545
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,313
Put your thinking caps on.

546
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:21,028
- I bet it's the Scottish play.
- No, it's Othello. It's always Othello.

547
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:33,791
Art thou afeard?

548
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,252
- Be not afeard.
- Caliban.

549
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:40,423
Oh, for heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess.

550
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,050
Don't listen to egghead. Go on, Dad.

551
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:46,762
The isle is full of noises,
sounds and sweet airs

552
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:49,098
that give delight, and hurt not.

553
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:53,185
Sometimes a thousand twangling
instruments will hum about mine ears,

554
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:57,356
and sometimes voices, that,
if then I had waked after long sleep,

555
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,152
will make me sleep again. All right,
clever clogs, so what comes next?

556
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,196
And then, in dreaming,
methought the clouds would...

557
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,949
- The clouds methought.
- The clouds methought would open,

558
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:09,201
and show riches ready to drop upon me,

559
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:11,579
that when I waked,
I cried to dream again.

560
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,164
That's such a sad thought.

561
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,587
My next patient must be a bit early.
You better go, lads, I'm sorry.

562
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,548
Won't be a moment, Clifford.

563
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:27,470
Bertie?

564
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,350
They told me not to expect you.

565
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,604
I'm sorry about your father.

566
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,442
- I don't wish to intrude.
- Not at all. Please, come in. Come in.

567
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,414
I've been practicing. An hour a day.

568
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:57,583
In spite of everything.

569
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,543
What's going on there?

570
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:03,714
Oh, I was... Sorry.

571
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:06,008
Mucking around with my kids.

572
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,597
Do you feel like working today?

573
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:19,397
- Curtis biplane.
- I'll put on some hot milk.

574
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,232
Logue. Logue.

575
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,026
I'd kill for something stronger.

576
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,409
I wasn't there
for my father's death.

577
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:35,663
- Still makes me sad.
- I can imagine so.

578
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,751
- What did your father do?
- He was a brewer.

579
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:42,795
At least there was free beer.

580
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,549
Here's to the memory of your father.

581
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:54,932
I was informed, after the fact,

582
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,601
that my father's...

583
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,728
My father's last words were...

584
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:06,986
..."Bertie has more guts than the
rest of his brothers put together."

585
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:13,033
Couldn't say that to my face.

586
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,165
My brother.

587
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,960
What about him?

588
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:27,173
Try singing it.

589
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,718
- I'm sorry?
- What songs do you know?

590
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,637
- Songs?
- Yeah, songs.

591
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,598
<i>- Swanee River.</i>
- I love that song.

592
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,225
- It happens to be my favorite.
- Sing me the chorus.

593
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,394
No. Certainly not.

594
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:46,442
You know...
I always wanted to build models.

595
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:51,280
But... Father wouldn't allow it.

596
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:57,036
He... collected stamps,
so we had to collect stamps.

597
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:01,081

Father encouraged it.

Said, "Get it out, boy!"
Said it would make me stop.

631

00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,191

00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:30,679
One-hundred-year-old spruces
removed to improve the view?

684
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,723
Who does she think she is?

685
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:36,226
Nonetheless, we must try
to be pleasant towards Mrs. Simpson.

686
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:39,646
- She calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook."
- You're not fat.

687
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,149
I'm getting plump.

688
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:44,776
Well, you seldom cook.

689
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,198
- I sifted seven...
- Shut up.

690
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:53,744
...thick sieves...
I sifted seven...

691
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,666
Three, two, one and...

692
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,252
Their Royal Highnesses
the Duke and Duchess of York.

693
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:06,298
Oh, how lovely to see you both.

694
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,178
Welcome to our little country shack.

695
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:14,514
I came at the invitation of the King.

696
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,854
Your Majesty.

697
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,608
- You all right?
- Sorry we're late.

698
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:28,779
Very nice to see you... Mrs. Simpson.

699
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:33,951
Very nice.

700
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,584
Hello, David. Making some...

701
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,128
...changes to the garden, I see.

702
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:47,965
Yes, I'm not quite finished yet.

703
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:54,429
Don't tell me I behaved badly,
Mr. Churchill.

704
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:56,890
On the contrary, Your Royal Highness.

705
00:57:56,974 --> 00:58:00,227
Etiquette decrees that royalty
should be greeted by the official host,

706
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,105
in this case, the King. Not a commoner.

707
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,399
Thank you.

708
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:11,405
- What is her hold on him?
- I've no idea.

709
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:17,160
Apparently, she has certain skills

710
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:20,789
acquired in an establishment
in Shanghai.

711
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,377
David.

712
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,423
Just be a sec, darling.
Would you excuse me?

713
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:44,438
- David, I've been trying to see you.
- I've been terribly busy.

714
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,024
- Doing what?
- Kinging.

715
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:51,778
Really? Kinging is a...

716
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,740
...a precarious business these days.
Where's the Russian tsar?

717
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:58,535
- Where's cousin Wilhelm?
- You're being dreary.

718
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:03,790
Is kinging laying <i>off</i> 80... staff
and buying more pearls for Wallis,

719
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,626
while people are marching across Europe
singing The Red Flag?

720
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,546
- Herr Hitler will sort them out.
- Who will sort out Herr Hitler?

721
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,299
Where's the bloody 23?

722
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,217
And you put that woman
in our mother's suite!

723
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:17,429
- Mama's not still in the bed, is she?
- That's not funny.

724
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,891
Here it is. Wallis likes the very best.

725
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,518
I don't care what woman
you carry on with at night,

726
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:26,396
as long as you... show up
for duty in the morning.

727
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,608
Wallis is not just some woman
I'm carrying on with.

728
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,443
We intend to marry.

729
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:37,240
- Excuse me?
- She's filing a petition for divorce.

730
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,950
Good God.

731
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:43,330
Can't you just give her
a nice house and a title?

732
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,291
- I'm not having her as my mistress.
- The Church doesn't recognize divorce,

733
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:50,504
- and you are the... head of the Church.
- Haven't I any rights?

734
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,798
- Many privileges.
- Not the same thing.

735
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,426
Your beloved common man
may marry for love. Why not me?

736
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,221
If you were... a common man,

737
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:02,432
on what basis could you...
possibly claim to be King?

738
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,142
Sounds like you've
studied our wretched Constitution.

739
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:06,812
- Sounds like you haven't.
- That's what this is about.

740
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:10,524
Brushing up.
Hence, the elocution lessons.

741
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:14,486
- That's the scoop around town.
- I'm trying to...

742
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:20,951
Yearning for a larger audience,
are we, B-B-Bertie?

743
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:25,997
Don't...

744
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:28,041
What's that?

745
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,961
I'm sorry, I...

746
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:34,506
Younger brother trying to push
older brother off the throne.

747
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,883
P-P-Positively mediaeval.

748
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:39,970
Wallis.

749
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:43,473
Ah. Where have you been all this time?

750
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:46,309
- Who have you been talking to?
- Never you mind.

751
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:53,358
What a very complicated
little King you are.

752
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,652
I try to be.

753
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,906
All that work... down the drain.

754
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:02,701
My own brother.

755
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:06,121
I couldn't say a single word
to him in reply.

756
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:09,332
Why do you stammer so much more
with David than you ever do with me?

757
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,626
Because you're bloody well
paid to listen.

758
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:15,672
- Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
- Stop trying to be so bloody clever.

759
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:19,092
What is it about David
that stops you speaking?

760
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:22,095
What is it about you that bloody
well makes you want to go on about him

761
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:25,015
- the whole bloody time?
- Vulgar but fluent.

762
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:27,851
- You don't stammer when you swear.
- Bugger off!

763
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:31,813
- Is that the best you can do?
- Well, bloody...

764
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:35,358
...bugger to you, you beastly bastard.

765
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:38,820
Oh, a public school prig
could do better than that.

766
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,530
Shit.

767
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:42,407
Shit, shit, shit.

768
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:45,702
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

769
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:49,664
Yes, defecation flows
trippingly from the tongue.

770
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,791
- Because I'm angry!
- Do you know the "f" word?

771
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:57,505
- Fornication?
- Oh, Bertie.

772
01:01:57,589 --> 01:02:00,175
Fuck. Fuck!

773
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:03,386
Fuck, fuck, fuckin' fuck!
Fuck, fuck and bugger!

774
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,513
Bugger, bugger, buggedy, fuck!

775
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:06,890
- Fuck, ass!
- Yes!

776
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,643
- Balls, balls, fuckety shit.
- You see? Not a hesitation.

777
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,395
Willy, shit and fuck! And tits.

778
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:16,191
- Dad, what's going on?
- Sorry.

779
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,776
Just finish your homework.

780
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:21,571
Well, that's a side of you
we don't get to see all that often.

781
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,448
No.

782
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:26,785
No, we're not supposed to, really.
Not publicly.

783
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:31,957
- Let's get some air.
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.

784
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:37,754
What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?

785
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:41,591
Logue, you have no idea.

786
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:44,761
My... my brother

787
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:48,181
is infatuated with a...

788
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,766
...woman who's been married twice.

789
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:53,937
She's asking for a divorce,
and he's determined to marry her.

790
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:58,566
- Jesus.
- Mrs. Wallis Simpson

791
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:01,611
- of Baltimore.
- That's not right.

792
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:04,948
- Queen Wallis of Baltimore.
- Unthinkable.

793
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,785
- Can he do it?
- Absolutely not.

794
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:12,998
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.

795
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:16,710
- Can't they just carry on privately?
- If only they would.

796
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,839
Where does this leave you?

797
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,427
I know my place. I...

798
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,805
I... I will do anything...

799
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,808
...in my power to keep
my brother on the throne.

800
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,853
Is it that serious?

801
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:40,233
- Your place may well be on the throne.
- I am not an alternative to my brother.

802
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:43,069
- You can outshine David.
- Don't take liberties!

803
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,656
- That's bordering on treason.
- I'm just saying you could be King.

804
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,616
- You could do it.
- That is treason.

805
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,660
I'm trying to get you to realize
you needn't be governed by fear.

806
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,495
I've had enough of this.

807
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:56,041
- What are you so afraid of?
- Your poisonous words!

808
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:58,835
Why did you come to me?
You're not some middle-class banker

809
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,837
who wants elocution lessons
so you can chitchat...

810
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,215
Don't attempt to instruct me
on my duties!

811
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:08,470
I am the son of a... King.

812
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:11,306
And the brother of... of a King.

813
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:14,642
You're the disappointing son
of a brewer.

814
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:18,021
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback.

815
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:22,233
You're a nobody.
These sessions are over.

816
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,898
Through here, sir.

817
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:09,197
It's not because she's an
American. That is the least of it.

818
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:14,244
It's because she's a soon
to be twice divorced American.

819
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:18,498
And the King,
as head of the Church of England,

820
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:22,001
cannot marry a divorced woman.

821
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:26,005
And, sir, I apologize
for the nature of this.

822
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:30,677
According to Scotland Yard,

823
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,849
the King has not always
possessed exclusive rights

824
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:41,020
to Mrs. Simpson's...
favors and affections...

825
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:45,275
...sharing them with a
married used car salesman,

826
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,278
a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.

827
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:54,367
In addition, it is also
rumored Hitler's ambassador,

828
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:59,122
Count von Ribbentrop,
sends her 17 carnations every day.

829
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:04,461
Should His Majesty continue to ignore
the advice of his government,

830
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:06,296
he must abdicate.

831
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:09,841
Otherwise, his government
has no choice but to resign.

832
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:13,011
Prime Minister,
you'd leave a country without a...

833
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,389
...a government?

834
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:20,560
Does the King do what he wants?

835
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,731
Or does he do what
the people expect him to do?

836
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,400
<i>As crowds in Downing
Street watch ministers come and go,</i>

837
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:30,904
<i>there is raised an age-old problem:
can a king separate his personal life</i>

838
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,448
<i>- from his public duty...</i>
- What's the matter, love?

839
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,326
I'm just having trouble with a patient.

840
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,330
That isn't like you.

841
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:45,293
- Why?
- He's scared.

842
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:48,129
He's afraid of his own shadow.

843
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,090
Isn't that why they come to you?

844
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:56,179
This fellow could
really be somebody great.

845
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,640
He's fighting me.

846
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:01,267
Perhaps he doesn't want to be great.

847
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:06,356
Perhaps that's what you want.

848
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,820
I might have overstepped the mark.

849
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,784
Apologize. Do you both good.

850
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:32,340
I'm very sorry, Mr. Logue,
the Duke is busy.

851
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:36,678
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.

852
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:40,265
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.

853
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,483
Thank you.

854
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,823
Thank you.

855
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,666
Parliament will not support
the marriage.

856
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,088
But there are other reasons for concern.

857
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:15,508
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve,

858
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:18,219
and there are those who are
worried about where he will stand

859
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,680
when war comes with Germany.

860
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:26,769
- We're not coming to that?
- Indeed we are, sir.

861
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:32,025
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this,
but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.

862
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,777
War with Germany will come.

863
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:39,198
And we will need a King
whom we can all stand behind, united.

864
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:41,993
I fear my...

865
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:45,455
...brother is not of sound mind...

866
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:48,416
...at this time.

867
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:52,378
Have you thought
what you will call yourself? Hmm?

868
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:04,057
Certainly not Albert, sir.
Too Germanic.

869
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:13,900
What about George?
After your father?

870
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:19,822
George the Sixth
has a rather nice continuity to it.

871
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:20,990
Don't you think?

872
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:27,830
David. Thank God.

873
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:30,291
You look exhausted.

874
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,587
How are you bearing up?

875
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:37,173
Bertie, the decision's been made. I...

876
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,926
I'm going.

877
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:44,764
- I can't accept that...
- I'm afraid there's no other way.

878
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,476
I must marry her.

879
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:54,107
My mind's made up. I'm... sorry.

880
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,445
That's a terrible thing to hear.

881
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,283
Nobody wants that.

882
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,786
I, least of all.

883
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,877
<i>At long last,</i>

884
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:18,673
<i>I am able to say a few words of my own.</i>

885
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:23,678
<i>I have never wanted
to withhold anything,</i>

886
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:27,014
<i>but until now it has not been
constitutionally possible</i>

887
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:28,391
<i>for me to speak.</i>

888
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:33,688
<i>A few hours ago,
I discharged my last duty</i>

889
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:37,567
<i>as King and Emperor,</i>

890
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:42,071
<i>and now that I have been succeeded
by my brother,</i>

891
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:43,990
<i>the Duke of York,</i>

892
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:47,910
<i>my first words must be
to declare my allegiance to him.</i>

893
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:51,748
<i>This I do with all my heart.</i>

894
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:59,338
You all know the reasons which have
impelled me to renounce the throne,

895
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:03,342
but you must believe me when I tell you

896
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,596
that I have found it impossible
to carry the heavy burden

897
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:10,808
of responsibility
and to discharge my duties as King,

898
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:13,269
as I would wish to do

899
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:18,191
without the help and support
of the woman I love.

900
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,110
<i>And I want you to know,</i>

901
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:26,115
<i>this decision has been
made less difficult to me</i>

902
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:29,035
<i>by the sure knowledge that my brother,</i>

903
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:32,288
<i>with his long training
in the public affairs of this country,</i>

904
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:36,459
<i>and with his fine qualities,</i>

905
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:39,212
<i>will be able to take my place forthwith</i>

906
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:43,883
<i>without interruption or injury</i>

907
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:47,887
<i>to the life and progress of the Empire.</i>

908
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,132
I meet you today...

909
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:09,802
...in...

910
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:15,892
...in circumstances which are...

911
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,911
- I'm sure you'll love it.
- There you go.

912
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:36,996
Thank you, darling.
Saddles. Margaret.

913
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:40,416
- There's Montezuma.
- Oh, here's one.

914
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:44,337
- Mama, here's a horse and saddle.
- Thank you. Oops.

915
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,548
- Don't worry, Sally. We'll get you...
- Mama?

916
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:49,383
- Yes?
- Will we have space for our horses

917
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:50,927
- in our new home?
- Course we will, darling.

918
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:52,470
We'll have a palace of rooms.

919
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,231
Curtsey.

920
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,693
Your Majesty.

921
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,170
How was it?

922
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:42,353
I was trying to...
familiarize myself

923
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:46,065
with... what a state paper looks like.

924
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:48,526
It's a...

925
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:55,074
...dispatch from Mr. Baldwin,
which I don't understand a word of.

926
01:14:58,285 --> 01:15:00,162
David's finances.

927
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:08,713
Christmas... broadcast.

928
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,092
- Think that would be a mistake.
- No, don't worry about that.

929
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,052
Oh.

930
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,147
Plans for the Coronation.

931
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:30,109
Think that would be
an even bigger mistake.

932
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:34,989
- I'm not a King.
- Oh, shush.

933
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:42,329
I'm a Naval officer. That's all I know.

934
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:47,585
I'm not a King. I'm not a King.

935
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:50,880
- I'm sorry.
- No.

936
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,799
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be silly. Please.

937
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,637
Oh, my dear.

938
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:01,265
My dear, dear man.

939
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:05,853
- I'm sorry.
- You know,

940
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:09,732
I refused your first
two marriage proposals,

941
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,401
not because I didn't love you,

942
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:15,571
but because I couldn't bear
the idea of a Royal life.

943
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:20,367
Couldn't bear the idea of a life
of tours, public duty, of...

944
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:24,663
Well, a life that no longer
was really to be my own.

945
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:31,087
But then I thought, he stammers
so beautifully, they'll leave us alone.

946
01:16:57,363 --> 01:17:02,451
Waiting for a King to apologize,
one can wait rather a long wait.

947
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:09,416
I'm afraid we're slightly late.

948
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:14,130
This is home.

949
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:17,133
Myrtle's at bridge.
I made sure the boys were out.

950
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:20,636
It's lovely. Absolutely lovely.

951
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,265
- Oh! May I sit down?
- Yes, of course.

952
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:34,608
- Would you like some tea, ma'am?
- Yes, I'll help myself.

953
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:37,903
Now, off you go.
Or must I knock your heads together?

954
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:41,282
Here's your shilling.

955
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:50,624
I...

956
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:54,170
I understand...

957
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:57,423
...what you were trying to say, Logue.

958
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,426
I went about it the wrong way.

959
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:02,803
I'm sorry.

960
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:06,348
So, here I am.

961
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:12,146
Is the nation ready for two...
minutes of radio silence?

962
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:15,816
Every stammerer always fears
going back to square one.

963
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,693
I don't let that happen.

964
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:21,155
If I fail in my duty,

965
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:25,826
David could come back.
I've seen the placards.

966
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:30,206
"God save our... King."

967
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:32,082
They don't mean me.

968
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:36,879
Every monarch in history

969
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:40,633
has succeeded someone who's dead

970
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:43,427
or just about to be.

971
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:51,143
My predecessor is not only alive,
but very much so.

972
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:56,899
It's a bloody mess.

973
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:00,486
Couldn't even give them
a Christmas speech.

974
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:03,572
- Like your dad used to do?
- Precisely.

975
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:06,283
He's not here anymore.

976
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:11,413
Yes, he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.

977
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:15,626
Easy enough to give away.

978
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:18,754
You don't have to carry him
around in your pocket.

979
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:20,339
Or your brother.

980
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:24,176
You don't need to be afraid
of the things you were afraid of

981
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,762
when you were five.

982
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,770
You're very much your own man, Bertie.

983
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:37,856
Am I?

984
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:44,863
- Your face is next, mate.
- Lionel, dear!

985
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:46,949
Myrtle.

986
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:50,577
- Is this your wife?
- Yes.

987
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,205
Bertie. Come here.

988
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:57,209
- Are you all right, Logue?
- Yes.

989
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:02,464
- Shouldn't we go through?
- Trust me, it's important.

990
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:07,636
- What is it?
- Oh!

991
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:10,222
- You're...
- It's "Your Majesty" the first time.

992
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:12,641
After that, it's "Ma'am." As in "ham."

993
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:14,393
Not "malm" as in "palm."

994
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:17,980
I haven't told her about us.

995
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:19,857
Sit down, relax.

996
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:24,445
I'm told your husband
calls my husband Bertie.

997
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:26,864
And my husband calls
your husband Lionel.

998
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,449
I trust you won't call me Liz.

999
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:33,454
Your Majesty, you may
call me Mrs. Logue, ma'am.

1000
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,414
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Logue.

1001
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:40,044
- Logue, we can't stay here all day.
- Yes, we can.

1002
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:42,296
- Logue!
- I need to wait for the right moment.

1003
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:45,215
- Logue, you're being a coward.
- You're damn right.

1004
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,135
Get out there, man.

1005
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:52,890
Hello, Myrtle, darling.

1006
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,017
You're early.

1007
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:59,146
I believe you two have met,
but I don't think you know...

1008
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:03,984
- ...King George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.

1009
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:11,075
Will Their Majesties
be staying to dinner?

1010
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:16,205
We'd love to, such a treat,
but alas a...

1011
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:19,041
...previous engagement. What a pity.

1012
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:37,768
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, Your Majesty.

1013
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:41,688
What a glorious transformation, sir.

1014
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:45,150
I hope you'll forgive us
if we continue our preparations?

1015
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:51,949
Now, allow me to guide you
through the ceremony.

1016
01:21:56,161 --> 01:22:01,250
We begin, of course,
at the West door into the nave.

1017
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:06,755
I see all your pronouncements
are to be broadcast, Archbishop.

1018
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:09,299
Ah, yes. Wireless.

1019
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:11,760
It is, indeed, a Pandora's box,

1020
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:16,056
and I'm afraid I've also had
to permit the newsreel cameras.

1021
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:19,768
The product of which
I shall personally edit.

1022
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:22,354
Without momentary hesitations.

1023
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:26,150
This is Dr. Logue of Harley Street.

1024
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:30,028
He's... my speech therapist.

1025
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:33,866
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty

1026
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,952
was seeking assistance, I should
have made my own recommendation.

1027
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,455
Dr. Logue will...

1028
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,416
...will be attending the Coronation.

1029
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:47,296
Of course I'll speak to the Dean,
but it will be extremely difficult.

1030
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:49,214
I should like the...

1031
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:54,344
...doctor to be seated in the...

1032
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:55,637
...King's Box.

1033
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:59,725
But members of your family
will be seated there, sir.

1034
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,602
That is why it is suitable.

1035
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:05,856
And now, if you don't mind, Your Grace,
we need the premises.

1036
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:08,484
My dear fellow,
this is Westminster Abbey.

1037
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,611
The Church must prepare His Majesty.

1038
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,614
My preparations are equally
as important.

1039
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:20,579
With complete privacy,
if you don't mind.

1040
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:24,583
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.

1041
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:29,796
I will place the Abbey
at Your Majesty's disposal,

1042
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,425
this evening. Your Majesty.

1043
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:07,918
I can't believe I'm walking
on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.

1044
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:13,507
Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.

1045
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:19,388
I'm not here to rehearse, Dr. Logue.

1046
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,976
Call me Lionel.

1047
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:29,147
True, you... never...

1048
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:32,568
...called yourself Doctor. I did that...

1049
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:36,113
...for you.

1050
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:40,909
No training.

1051
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:43,829
No diploma, no...

1052
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,375
...qualifications.

1053
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:52,296
Just... a great deal of nerve.

1054
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,716
The Star Chamber inquisition, is it?

1055
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:57,718
You asked for trust.

1056
01:24:57,801 --> 01:25:02,264
And... total equality.

1057
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:05,767
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.

1058
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:09,521
My son Laurie said, "Dad, do you think
you could help that poor man?"

1059
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:13,066
- What, as a failed actor?
- It's true.

1060
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:18,822
I'm not a doctor.
And yes, I acted, a bit.

1061
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:23,368
Well, I recited in pubs.
I taught elocution in schools.

1062
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:25,037
When the Great War came,

1063
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,664
all our soldiers were returning
to Australia from the front,

1064
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:31,376
a lot of them shell-shocked,
unable to speak.

1065
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,879
Somebody said, Lionel,
"You're very good at this speech stuff.

1066
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,632
Do you think you could possibly
help these poor buggers?"

1067
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:40,427
I did muscle therapy,
exercises, relaxation,

1068
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,763
but I knew I had to go deeper.

1069
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:46,767
Those poor young blokes
had cried out in fear.

1070
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:49,102
No one was listening to them.

1071
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:53,732
My job was to give them faith
in their own voice,

1072
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:57,444
and let them know that
a friend was listening.

1073
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:01,865
That must ring
a few bells with you, Bertie.

1074
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:08,455
You give a very noble
account of yourself.

1075
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:12,501
- Make inquiries. It's all true.
- Inquiries have been made.

1076
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:16,338
You have no idea who I have
breathing down my neck.

1077
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:20,092
I vouched for you, and you have no...

1078
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,597
- ...credentials.
- But lots of success.

1079
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:29,017
I can't show you a certificate.
There was no training then.

1080
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,936
Everything I know,
I know from experience.

1081
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:34,648
And that war was some experience.

1082
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:39,361
My plaque says,
"L. Logue, Speech Defects."

1083
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:42,447
Not "Doctor."
There are no letters after my name.

1084
01:26:47,244 --> 01:26:49,871
- Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could.

1085
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:51,623
- On what charge?
- Fraud.

1086
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:55,377
With war looming, you've saddled
this nation with a voiceless...

1087
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:59,715
...King. You've destroyed
the happiness of my family,

1088
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:05,011
all for the sake of ensnaring
a star... patient you couldn't...

1089
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:07,597
...possibly hope to assist.

1090
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,642
It'll be like mad...

1091
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:14,563
...King George the Third.

1092
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:18,984
I'll be... Mad King...

1093
01:27:20,026 --> 01:27:22,279
...George the Stammerer...

1094
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:27,826
...who let his people down
so badly in their hour of need.

1095
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:31,413
What are you doing? Get up!
You can't sit there! Get up!

1096
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:34,416
- Why not? It's a chair.
- No, it... That is not a chair!

1097
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:36,501
That is... That...

1098
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:40,255
- That is Saint Edward's chair.
- People have carved their names on it.

1099
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:41,923
That chair is the seat
on which every King...

1100
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:45,552
- It's held in place by a large rock.
- That is the Stone of Scone!

1101
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:50,265
- You are trivializing everything.
- I don't care how many royal assholes

1102
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:52,350
- have sat on this chair.
- Listen to me! Listen to me!

1103
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:54,728
- Listen to you? By what right?
- By Divine Right, if you must.

1104
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:55,937
- I am your King!
- No, you're not.

1105
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:58,315
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.

1106
01:27:58,398 --> 01:27:59,691
Why should I waste my time
listening to you?

1107
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:02,903
Because I have a right to be heard!
I have a voice!

1108
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:09,868
Yes, you do.

1109
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:23,465
You have such perseverance, Bertie.
You're the bravest man I know.

1110
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:25,842
You'll make a bloody good King.

1111
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:37,395
- What on earth is going on, sir?
- It's quite all right, Archbishop.

1112
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:39,147
Mr. Logue, you must know that

1113
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:43,026
I've found a replacement English
specialist with impeccable credentials.

1114
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:46,655
Hence, your services
will no longer be required.

1115
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:48,698
- I'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's function

1116
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:51,743
is to consult and be advised.
Now, you didn't consult,

1117
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:57,123
- but you have just been advised.
- And now I advise you.

1118
01:28:57,207 --> 01:29:03,129
In this personal matter,
I will make my own decision.

1119
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:07,968
My concern is for the head
on which I must place the crown.

1120
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:10,178
I appreciate that, Archbishop.

1121
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,765
But it's my head.

1122
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:16,977
Your humble servant.

1123
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:25,777
Thank you, Bertie.

1124
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:31,616
Shall we rehearse? Come on.
Up on your perch.

1125
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,210
Now, when you and Elizabeth
enter through the West door,

1126
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:46,423
you will be greeted by the hymn
"I was glad when they said unto me."

1127
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:49,801
Actually, you won't be that glad because
they do sing it for a very long time.

1128
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:56,683
Then your friend, the Archbishop,
will ponce up the stairs towards you,

1129
01:29:56,766 --> 01:30:02,063
and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty
willing to take the oath?"

1130
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:05,650
- "I am willing."
- Well, of course you are.

1131
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,903
I'm gonna see what this sounds like
in the cheap seats,

1132
01:30:07,986 --> 01:30:10,405
so even your old nanny can hear.

1133
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:15,243
"Will you govern your peoples,
Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,

1134
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:18,246
Australia and New Zealand,

1135
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:22,292
according to their lands and customs?"

1136
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:24,711
- "I solemnly promise to do so."
- Louder.

1137
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:28,590
- I can't hear you up the back.
- "I solemnly promise to do so."

1138
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:31,760
Very good. "And will you, to your power,

1139
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:36,932
cause Law and Justice, in Mercy to be
executed in all your judgments?"

1140
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:38,892
"I will. I will!"

1141
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:42,020
Then there's a very long bit
about upholding the faith. It goes on,

1142
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:44,856
rubbish, rubbish, rubbish,
to which you finally say...

1143
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:50,862
"The things which I have...
here before promised,

1144
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:54,741
I will perform and keep.
So help me God."

1145
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:58,203
And that's all you say.
Four short responses.

1146
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:01,706
Kiss the book, sign the oath,
and you're King.

1147
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:03,458
Easy.

1148
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:19,724
You nearly crowned him backwards,
Archbishop.

1149
01:31:21,226 --> 01:31:25,313
Someone had removed the thread
marking the back of the crown, sir.

1150
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:27,649
Try not to lose the thread, Archbishop.

1151
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:31,236
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.

1152
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:37,033
<i>- God save the King.</i>
- Very good.

1153
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:39,285
Very good, Archbishop.

1154
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:43,790
Well, I hope Your Majesties
are thrilled with the result.

1155
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:49,004
- You can switch that machine off.
- No, wait. Keep going.

1156
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:51,464
<i>- Nazism has held its great convention.</i>
- Do take a seat, Archbishop.

1157
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:53,758
<i>Masses of uniformed men,
stupefying to the eye,</i>

1158
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:57,345
<i>and incredible to the imagination
have stood in spellbound audience</i>

1159
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,973
<i>of the Fuhrer.</i>

1160
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:14,029
- Papa? Papa, what's he saying?
- Hmm?

1161
01:32:14,112 --> 01:32:18,283
I don't know, but he seems
to be saying it rather well.

1162
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:42,599
Sir... I have asked to see you today

1163
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:46,811
in order to tender my resignation
as Prime Minister.

1164
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:51,608
I'm so sorry to hear that,
Mr. Baldwin.

1165
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:55,361
Neville Chamberlain will
take my place as Prime Minister.

1166
01:32:55,445 --> 01:33:00,033
It's a matter of principle.
I was mistaken.

1167
01:33:00,116 --> 01:33:03,661
I have found it impossible to believe

1168
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:07,082
that there is any man in the world

1169
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:12,253
so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,

1170
01:33:12,337 --> 01:33:16,883
that the world may be hurled
for a second time

1171
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:20,261
into the abyss of destructive war.

1172
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:24,682
Churchill was right all along.

1173
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:27,310
This was always Hitler's intention.

1174
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:33,191
I'm only very sorry to leave you
at this great time of crisis.

1175
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:41,825
I'm very much afraid, sir,
that your greatest test is yet to come.

1176
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,415
<i>I am speaking to you...</i>

1177
01:33:49,499 --> 01:33:54,629
<i>...from the Cabinet room
at 10 Downing Street.</i>

1178
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:58,967
<i>This morning,
the British ambassador in Berlin</i>

1179
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:03,054
<i>handed the German government
a final note</i>

1180
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:08,810
<i>stating that unless
we heard from them by 11:</i><i>00,</i>

1181
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:14,023
<i>that they were prepared at once
to withdraw their troops from Poland,</i>

1182
01:34:14,107 --> 01:34:17,443
<i>a state of war would exist between us.</i>

1183
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:25,160
<i>I have to tell you now that
no such undertaking has been received,</i>

1184
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:30,790
<i>and that, consequently, this country
is at war with Germany.</i>

1185
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:38,882
At last, sir, here is your speech.

1186
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:41,968
You are on air at six.

1187
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:46,598
I have timed it
to just under nine minutes.

1188
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:49,309
The wording is fully approved.

1189
01:34:49,392 --> 01:34:52,103
The Prime Minister
will be joining you for the broadcast,

1190
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:54,898
which will go out live
across the nation, the Empire

1191
01:34:54,981 --> 01:34:58,318
- and to our armed forces.
- Get Logue here immediately.

1192
01:35:12,874 --> 01:35:15,627
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.

1193
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:20,048
- They got them up there quickly.
- Yeah.

1194
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:35,355
- Shall we pull over and find a shelter?
- No, no. Go straight there.

1195
01:35:35,438 --> 01:35:36,856
We'll be all right.

1196
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:48,451
- Yes, sir?
- Lionel Logue.

1197
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:51,704
Major Hartley is expecting me.
This is my son, Laurie.

1198
01:35:59,337 --> 01:36:01,673
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.

1199
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:09,514
- The King's speech.
- Thank you, sir.

1200
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:12,433
We have about 40 minutes
to the broadcast.

1201
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:17,855
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1202
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:21,693
There may be dark days ahead...

1203
01:36:22,568 --> 01:36:25,488
- ...and...
- Try again.

1204
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:33,663
There may be dark days ahead, and...

1205
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:38,293
Turn the hesitations into pauses and say
to yourself, "God save the King."

1206
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:42,046
I say that continuously,
but apparently no one's listening.

1207
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:45,133
Long pauses are good.
They add solemnity to great occasions.

1208
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:48,261
Then I'm the solemnest king
who ever lived.

1209
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:52,890
You know, if I'm a king,
where's my power?

1210
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:54,809
Can I... can I form a government?

1211
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:58,271
Can I... can I... levy a tax?

1212
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:00,815
Declare a... a war? No.

1213
01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:04,110
And yet I'm the seat of all authority.
Why? Because...

1214
01:37:04,694 --> 01:37:07,989
...the nation believes
that when I... I speak,

1215
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:10,325
I speak for them. But I can't speak.

1216
01:37:12,035 --> 01:37:15,038
Let's take it all again from the top.
"In this grave hour."

1217
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:31,304
In this grave hour...
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

<i>But it has been... in vain.</i>

1302
01:45:06,884 --> 01:45:11,931
We have been forced into a conflict,

1303
01:45:12,014 --> 01:45:16,936
<i>for we are called
to meet the challenge of a principle,</i>

1304

<i>which, if it were to prevail,</i>

1305
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:25,861
<i>would be fatal to any civilized order</i>

<i>in the world.</i>

1307
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:31,575

stripped of all disguise,

1309
01:45:37,665 --> 01:45:40,793
is surely the mere...

1310
01:45:43,921 --> 01:45:47,883
...primitive doctrine that might...

1311
01:45:49,426 --> 01:45:51,011
...is right.

1312
01:45:51,971 --> 01:45:57,810
<i>For the sake of all
that we ourselves hold dear,</i>

1313
01:45:57,893 --> 01:46:01,480
<i>it is unthinkable</i>

1314
01:46:01,564 --> 01:46:06,235
that we should refuse to meet...

1315
01:46:06,318 --> 01:46:07,987

1316
01:46:10,531 --> 01:46:15,286
<i>It is to this high purpose</i>

1317
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:18,038
<i>that I now call</i>

01:46:18,122 --> 01:46:22,084
<i>my people at home,</i>

1319
01:46:22,167 --> 01:46:26,672
<i>and my peoples across the seas,</i>

<i>who will make our cause their own.</i>

1321
01:46:31,594 --> 01:46:36,599
I ask them to stand calm

1322
01:46:36,682 --> 01:46:39,852
and firm and united

1323
01:46:39,935 --> 01:46:43,981
<i>in this time of trial.</i>

01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:46,817
<i>The task will be hard.</i>

01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:57,661
<i>and war can no longer be confined</i>

1330

1331
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:14,386
our cause to God.

1332
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:19,934
If one and all we keep

1333
01:47:20,017 --> 01:47:24,939
resolutely faithful to it,

1334
01:47:25,022 --> 01:47:30,945
then, with God's help,

1335
01:47:31,028 --> 01:47:34,907
we shall... prevail.

1336
01:47:50,005 --> 01:47:51,632

1337
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:09,233
You still stammered on the "W."

1338
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:14,071
Well, I had to throw in a few,

01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:24,308
...Your Majesty.

1353
01:49:36,737 --> 01:49:38,530
I knew you'd be good.

1354
01:49:47,539 --> 01:49:50,918
Thank you... Lionel.

1355
01:49:53,962 --> 01:49:55,422
Onwards.

1356
01:49:56,215 --> 01:49:59,551
- Congratulations, sir.
- Well done, sir.

1357
01:49:59,635 --> 01:50:01,595
Couldn't have
said it better myself, sir.

1358
01:50:01,678 --> 01:50:04,681
Your Majesty, I am speechless.

1359
01:50:04,765 --> 01:50:08,143
- Congratulations, sir.
- Gentlemen.

1360
01:50:10,354 --> 01:50:14,858
- So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
- Halting at first,

1361
01:50:14,942 --> 01:50:19,696
- but you got much better, Papa.
- Well, bless you.

1362
01:50:20,572 --> 01:50:24,284
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.

1363
01:50:24,368 --> 01:50:26,787
Of course I was.

1364
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:29,957
Are we all ready?

1365
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:31,542
Come on, girls.
