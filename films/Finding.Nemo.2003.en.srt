1
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,895
Yes, Marlin.

2
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,022
I see it. It's beautiful.

3
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,817
So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view,

4
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,612
you didn't think you were going to get the whole ocean, did you?

5
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,574
Oh, yeah!

6
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:17,744
A fish can breathe out here. Did your man deliver or did he deliver?

7
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,247
- My man delivered. - It wasn't so easy.

8
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,208
A lot of clown fish had their eyes on this place.

9
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,962
You better believe they did. Every single one of them.

10
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,299
You did good and the neighbourhood is awesome.

11
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:45,772
- So you do like it, don't you? - No, no, I really do like it.

12
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,817
But, Marlin, I know that the Drop Off is desirable,

13
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,819
great schools, amazing view,

14
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,447
but do we really need so much space?

15
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,033
Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about.

16
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,242
They deserve the best.

17
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:01,622
Look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and see a whale

18
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,832
right by their bedroom window!

19
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,502
- You're going to wake the kids. - Oh, right. Right.

20
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,466
Look.

21
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,886
They're dreaming.

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,307
- We still have to name them. - All of them? Right now?

23
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,560
All right. We'll name this half Marlin Jr.

24
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,771
And this half Coral Jr.

25
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,315
- Okay, we're done. - I like Nemo.

26
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,816
Nemo?

27
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,695
We'll name one Nemo, but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.

28
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,698
In a couple of days, we're going to be parents!

29
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:37,908
Yeah.

30
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,578
- What if they don't like me? - Marlin...

31
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,330
There's over 400 eggs.

32
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,583
Odds are one of them is bound to like you.

33
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,921
What?

34
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,341
- You remember how we met? - I try not to.

35
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,634
Well, I remember.

36
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,553
Excuse me, miss. Can you see if I have a hook in my lip?

37
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,847
- Marlin. - Look closer.

38
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,142
- Get away! - Here he is. Cutie's here!

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,438
Where did everybody go?

40
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,030
Coral, get inside the house.

41
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,993
No, don't. They'll be fine. Just get inside.

42
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,745
You. Right now.

43
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:27,749
No!

44
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,019
Coral!

45
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,610
Coral?

46
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,322
Coral?

47
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,497
Coral!

48
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,376
Coral!

49
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,467
Coral?

50
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,617
There, there.

51
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,660
It's okay. Daddy's here.

52
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:48,878
Daddy's got you.

53
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:56,136
I promise I will never let anything happen to you,

54
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:57,512
Nemo.

55
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:37,927
First day of school! Wake up! Come on. First day of school.

56
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,251
I don't want to go to school.

57
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:44,128
- Not you, Dad. Me. - Okay.

58
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,213
Get up! Time for school!

59
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:50,801
- All right, I'm up. It's time for school. - Oh, boy!

60
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,011
Nemo!

61
00:05:52,094 --> 00:05:54,847
- First day of school! - Don't move.

62
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,434
You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it.

63
00:05:58,517 --> 00:06:00,352
- You feel a break? - No.

64
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:03,606
Sometimes fluid is rushing to the area. Any rushing fluids?

65
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:06,400
- No. - How many stripes do I have?

66
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:08,402
- Answer the question. - Three.

67
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:11,864
No! Something's wrong with you. I have one, two...

68
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:13,824
Three. That's all I have?

69
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,909
You're okay. How's the lucky fin?

70
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:18,245
- Lucky. - Let's see.

71
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:23,167
Sure you want to go to school this year?

72
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,962
- You can wait five or six years. - Come on, Dad. It's time for school.

73
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,256
Forgot to brush.

74
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,800
Do you want this anemone to sting you?

75
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:33,344
- Yes. - Brush.

76
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:35,929
- I'm done. - You missed a spot.

77
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:37,890
- Where? - There.

78
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:40,351
Right there. And here and here.

79
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,573
We're excited. First day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn.

80
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:56,867
What do we have to remember about the ocean?

81
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,453
- It's not safe. - That's my boy.

82
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:04,333
First, we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in.

83
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,627
Then we go out and back in.

84
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,630
Then one more time. Out and back in.

85
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:12,383
- If you want to do it four times... - Dad...

86
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,385
All right. Come on, boy.

87
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:19,723
Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark.

88
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,434
- I doubt that. - Have you ever met a shark?

89
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:25,187
- No, and I don't plan to. - How old are sea turtles?

90
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,481
Sea turtles? I don't know.

91
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:29,983
Sandy Plankton from next door said that

92
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:34,238
sea turtles live to be about 100 years old.

93
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:38,867
If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him, after I'm done talking to the shark.

94
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:40,994
Hold on. Wait to cross.

95
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:44,623
Hold my fin. Hold my fin.

96
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:47,960
You're not going to freak out like you did at the petting zoo.

97
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:50,587
That snail was about to charge.

98
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,507
I wonder where we're supposed to go.

99
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,719
- Bye, Mom. - I'll pick you up after school.

100
00:07:58,595 --> 00:08:01,515
Come on, you guys. Stop it. Give it back.

101
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:04,601
Come on. We'll try over there.

102
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:08,605
Excuse me. Is this where we meet his teacher?

103
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:12,192
- Look who's out of the anemone. - Yes, shocking, I know.

104
00:08:12,276 --> 00:08:13,652
- Marty? - Marlin.

105
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:14,695
- Bob. - Ted.

106
00:08:14,778 --> 00:08:16,780
Phil. Hey, you're a clown fish.

107
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:19,658
You're funny, right? Tell us a joke.

108
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:22,035
- Yeah. - Good idea.

109
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:26,331
That's a misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish.

110
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:28,876
- Come on, Clowny. - Do something funny.

111
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,211
All right. I know one joke.

112
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:35,340
There's a mollusk. He walks up to...

113
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:37,134
Well, he swims up.

114
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:41,054
Actually, the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place.

115
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:42,556
And then the sea cucumber...

116
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:46,852
I'm mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber.

117
00:08:46,935 --> 00:08:48,771
None of them were walking...

118
00:08:48,854 --> 00:08:51,982
Sheldon! Get out of Mr Johanssen's yard now!

119
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,068
All right, you kids!

120
00:08:55,152 --> 00:08:57,196
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

121
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,656
Can I go play, too? Can I?

122
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,493
I would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.

123
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,957
That's where I would play.

124
00:09:10,793 --> 00:09:14,046
- What's wrong with his fin? - He looks funny.

125
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:17,591
- Hey, what did I do? - Be nice. It's his first time at school.

126
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:20,177
He was born with it. We call it his lucky fin.

127
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,303
Dad...

128
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:25,140
See this tentacle? It's shorter than all my other tentacles.

129
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:29,603
But you can't really tell. Especially when I twirl them like this.

130
00:09:29,686 --> 00:09:31,688
I'm H20 intolerant.

131
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:34,191
I'm obnoxious.

132
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:38,195
Let's name the zones, the zones, the zones

133
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,989
Let's name the zones of the open sea

134
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:42,407
Mr Ray!

135
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:44,535
- Come on, Nemo. - Stay with me.

136
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:47,454
There's epipelagic, mesopelagic, bathyal, abyssopelagic

137
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:51,041
All the rest are too deep for you and me to see

138
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,794
I wonder where my class has gone.

139
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:55,671
We're under here.

140
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:59,466
There you are! Come aboard, explorers.

141
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,094
Knowledge exploring is oh so lyrical

142
00:10:02,177 --> 00:10:04,638
When you think thoughts that are empirical

143
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:05,973
Dad, you can go now.

144
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:09,017
- Well, hello. Who is this? - I'm Nemo.

145
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:12,646
Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.

146
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:15,649
- Okay. - You live in what kind of home?

147
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:19,903
In an anemoninny. Anemonemenemone.

148
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,364
Don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard.

149
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:24,491
Just so you know, he's got a little fin.

150
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:28,078
If he's having trouble swimming, let him take a break. 15 minutes.

151
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,330
Dad, it's time for you to go now.

152
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:32,499
We're going to stay together.

153
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,210
Okay, class. Optical orbits up front.

154
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:39,673
Remember, we keep our supraesophageal ganglion to ourselves.

155
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:42,467
- That means you, Jimmy. - Oh, man!

156
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,929
- Bye, Nemo. - Bye, Dad.

157
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:47,681
Bye, son.

158
00:10:50,392 --> 00:10:52,019
Be safe.

159
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:54,521
You're doing well for a first-timer.

160
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:56,857
You can't hold on to them forever, can you?

161
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,152
I had a tough time when my eldest went out on the Drop Off.

162
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:02,779
The Drop Off! They're going to the Drop Off?

163
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,489
Are you insane?

164
00:11:04,573 --> 00:11:07,451
Why don't we fry them up now and serve them with chips?

165
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,161
Hey, Marty, calm down.

166
00:11:09,244 --> 00:11:11,038
Don't tell me to be calm, pony-boy.

167
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:13,790
Pony-boy?

168
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:16,501
For a clown fish, he really isn't that funny.

169
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:17,586
Pity.

170
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:22,215
Let's name the species, the species, the species

171
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:25,135
Let's name the species that live in the sea

172
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,894
Mollusca and gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma, chord at a

173
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:35,228
And some fish like you and me!

174
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:37,230
Come on. Sing with me.

175
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,909
Seaweed is cool, seaweed is fun

176
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:50,994
It makes its food from the rays of the sun

177
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:55,791
Okay, the Drop Off.

178
00:11:55,874 --> 00:11:59,169
All right, kids. Feel free to explore, but stay close.

179
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,922
Stromatolitic cyanobacteria! Gather.

180
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:05,217
An ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck.

181
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:09,346
Come on. Let's go.

182
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:11,306
Come on. Sing with me.

183
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,393
There's porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa

184
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:16,019
Anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas three

185
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:18,814
Hey, guys, wait up.

186
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:21,191
Whoa!

187
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,363
Cool.

188
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:30,158
Saved your life!

189
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:32,786
You guys made me ink.

190
00:12:33,745 --> 00:12:34,955
What's that?

191
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,376
I know what that is. Sandy Plankton saw one.

192
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:42,587
He said it was called a butt.

193
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:46,341
Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

194
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:51,388
Look at me. I'm going to go touch the butt.

195
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:56,351
Oh, yeah? Let's see you get closer.

196
00:12:56,435 --> 00:12:57,728
Okay.

197
00:12:59,187 --> 00:13:00,564
Beat that.

198
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:03,150
Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?

199
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:07,529
- My dad says it's not safe. - Nemo, no!

200
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:08,739
Dad?

201
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,449
You were about to swim into open water.

202
00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:11,533
No!

203
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:13,410
Good thing I was here.

204
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,912
- He wasn't going to go. - He was too afraid.

205
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,540
- I wasn't. - This does not concern you.

206
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:22,085
You're lucky I don't tell your parents. You can't swim well.

207
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:25,380
- I can swim fine, Dad, okay? - No. It's not okay.

208
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:26,923
You shouldn't be near here.

209
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:29,593
You'll start school in a year or two.

210
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,763
No. Just because you're scared of the ocean...

211
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,765
Clearly you're not ready.

212
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:37,809
You think you can do these things, but you just can't!

213
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:40,771
I hate you.

214
00:13:42,272 --> 00:13:44,983
There's...

215
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:46,860
Nothing to see. Gather there.

216
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:50,238
Anything I can do? I am a scientist. Is there any problem?

217
00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:53,492
I didn't mean to interrupt. He isn't a good swimmer.

218
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:56,745
I think it's too soon for him to be out here unsupervised.

219
00:13:56,828 --> 00:13:59,039
I can assure you, he's quite safe with me.

220
00:13:59,122 --> 00:14:00,290
I'm sure he is.

221
00:14:00,582 --> 00:14:03,627
But you have a large class and he can get lost from sight

222
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:05,587
if you're not looking.

223
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,465
Oh, my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea.

224
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:11,635
Nemo!

225
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:14,721
What do you think you're doing?

226
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:17,766
You're going to get stuck

227
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:20,727
and I'm going to have to get you before another fish does.

228
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:23,438
Get back here.

229
00:14:23,522 --> 00:14:25,982
I said get back here now!

230
00:14:27,192 --> 00:14:28,777
Stop.

231
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,904
You take one more move, mister...

232
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,283
Don't you dare. If you put one fin on that boat...

233
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,868
Are you listening to me?

234
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:38,995
Don't touch the boa...

235
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,080
Nemo!

236
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:41,748
He touched the butt.

237
00:14:41,832 --> 00:14:44,626
You paddle your little tail back here.

238
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:47,504
That's right. You are in big trouble, young man.

239
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,673
Do you hear me? Big...

240
00:14:56,346 --> 00:14:58,431
Daddy, help me!

241
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,017
I'm coming, Nemo.

242
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:04,604
Get under me, kids.

243
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:07,357
No! Dad!

244
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:16,366
Nemo!

245
00:15:20,203 --> 00:15:22,289
Nemo! Nemo, no!

246
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,666
Nemo!

247
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:25,959
Nemo, Nemo!

248
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:27,419
No!

249
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:31,047
No!

250
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,893
Nemo, Nemo!

251
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:54,446
Hold on!

252
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:07,918
Oh, no.

253
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:10,503
No. It's gone. It's gone.

254
00:16:10,587 --> 00:16:12,923
It can't be gone. No. No!

255
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,175
Nemo! Nemo...

256
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,469
Nemo!

257
00:16:17,552 --> 00:16:18,762
No.

258
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:22,515
Nemo! Nemo!

259
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:23,642
No.

260
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:25,185
No. Please, no.

261
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,105
No, no.

262
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,360
Has anybody seen a boat?

263
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:35,278
Please. A white boat?

264
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,781
My son! My son!

265
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,199
Help me. Please.

266
00:16:39,282 --> 00:16:40,617
Look out!

267
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:48,041
Sorry. I didn't see you, sir.

268
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:49,542
Are you okay?

269
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:51,294
- He's gone. - There, there.

270
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,046
- He's gone. - It's all right.

271
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:55,548
- It'll be okay. - No, they took him away.

272
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:57,217
I have to find the boat.

273
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,886
- A boat? I've seen a boat. - You have?

274
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,014
- And it passed by not too long ago. - A white one?

275
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:05,141
- Hi. I'm Dory. - Where? Which way?

276
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:08,228
It went this way.

277
00:17:08,311 --> 00:17:10,563
- Follow me. - Thank you.

278
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:12,023
Thank you so much.

279
00:17:12,107 --> 00:17:13,608
No problem.

280
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:41,261
Wait.

281
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:52,314
Quit it. I'm trying to swim here. The ocean isn't big enough for you?

282
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:54,524
You got a problem, buddy?

283
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,859
Do you? Do you?

284
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,069
Want a piece of me? Yeah.

285
00:17:58,153 --> 00:17:59,696
I'm scared now!

286
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,781
- Wait. - Stop following me, okay?

287
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:04,951
What? You're showing me which way the boat went.

288
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:08,705
A boat? I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago.

289
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:11,708
It went this way. Follow me.

290
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,793
Wait a minute. What is going on?

291
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:15,920
You already told me which way the boat was going.

292
00:18:16,588 --> 00:18:19,174
I did? Oh, no.

293
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:23,053
If this is some kind of joke, it's not funny and I know funny.

294
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:27,349
- I'm a clown fish. - No, it's not. I'm so sorry.

295
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:30,810
See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.

296
00:18:30,894 --> 00:18:33,229
Short-term memory loss.

297
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,148
- I don't believe this. - No.

298
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:38,735
I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family.

299
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,570
At least I think it does.

300
00:18:42,906 --> 00:18:44,407
Where are they?

301
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:50,163
Can I help you?

302
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:53,458
Something's wrong with you. Really.

303
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,335
You're wasting my time.

304
00:18:55,418 --> 00:18:57,295
I have to find my son.

305
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:01,758
Hello.

306
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:03,885
Well, hi!

307
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,388
Name's Bruce.

308
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:09,140
It's all right. I understand.

309
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:11,643
Why trust a shark, right?

310
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:24,364
So, what's a couple of bites like you doing out so late?

311
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:26,408
Nothing. We're not even out.

312
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:27,742
Great.

313
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:32,330
Then how would you morsels like to come to a little get-together I'm having?

314
00:19:32,414 --> 00:19:36,626
- You mean like a party? - Yeah, right. A party.

315
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,879
- What do you say? - I love parties. That sounds like fun.

316
00:19:39,963 --> 00:19:43,550
Parties are fun and it's tempting, but we can't because...

317
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:46,052
Come on. I insist.

318
00:19:46,136 --> 00:19:48,638
Okay. That's all that matters.

319
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,436
Look. Balloons. It is a party.

320
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:59,441
Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy.

321
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:01,276
You wouldn't want one of them to pop.

322
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,917
Anchor! Chum!

323
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:20,753
There you are, Bruce. Finally.

324
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:23,631
- We got company. - It's about time, mate.

325
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:26,593
We've gone through the snacks and I'm starving.

326
00:20:26,676 --> 00:20:28,803
We almost had to have a feeding frenzy.

327
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:30,513
Let's get this over with.

328
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:36,102
Right then. The meeting has officially come to order.

329
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:37,812
Let us all say the pledge.

330
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:39,772
I am a nice shark,

331
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:42,233
not a mindless eating machine.

332
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:46,988
If I am to change this image, I must first change myself.

333
00:20:47,197 --> 00:20:49,741
Fish are friends, not food.

334
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:51,451
Except stinking dolphins.

335
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:54,412
Dolphins! Yeah, they think they're so cute.

336
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:58,625
Look, I'm a flipping little dolphin. Let me flip for you. Ain't I something?

337
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:02,253
Today's meeting is step five: Bring a Fish Friend.

338
00:21:02,337 --> 00:21:04,547
- Do you all have your friends? - Got mine.

339
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:09,052
- Hey there! - How about you, Chum?

340
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:12,847
Well, I seem to have misplaced my

341
00:21:12,931 --> 00:21:14,557
friend.

342
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,601
It's all right, Chum.

343
00:21:16,684 --> 00:21:19,604
Help yourself to one of my friends.

344
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:23,149
Thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum.

345
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:26,861
I'll start the testimonies. Hello. My name is Bruce.

346
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:28,154
Hello, Bruce.

347
00:21:28,238 --> 00:21:31,449
It has been three weeks since my last fish, on my honour,

348
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:33,826
or may I be chopped up and made into soup.

349
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:36,704
- You're an inspiration to us. - Amen.

350
00:21:37,956 --> 00:21:40,667
- Right, then. Who's next? - Pick me. Pick me.

351
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,585
The little sheila down the front.

352
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,921
Come on up here.

353
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:47,590
Hi. I'm Dory.

354
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,217
Hello, Dory.

355
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,637
And... Well, I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.

356
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:56,766
- Hey, that's incredible. - Good on you, mate!

357
00:21:57,392 --> 00:21:58,851
I'm glad I got that off my chest.

358
00:21:58,935 --> 00:22:03,147
Anyone else? How about you, mate? What's your problem?

359
00:22:03,231 --> 00:22:05,567
Me? I don't have a problem.

360
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:08,111
- Okay. - Denial.

361
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,488
Just start with your name.

362
00:22:10,572 --> 00:22:12,824
Okay. Hello.

363
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:15,952
My name is Marlin. I'm a clown fish.

364
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:19,539
- A clown fish? Really? - Go on. Tell us a joke.

365
00:22:19,622 --> 00:22:20,790
I love jokes.

366
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:24,085
I actually do know one that's pretty good.

367
00:22:25,128 --> 00:22:28,590
There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea cucumber.

368
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:32,093
Normally they don't talk, but in a joke, everyone talks.

369
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:35,179
The sea mollusk says to the cucumber...

370
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:38,975
Daddy!

371
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:40,602
Nemo!

372
00:22:40,977 --> 00:22:42,812
Nemo!

373
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,898
- I don't get it. - For a clown fish he's not that funny.

374
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:50,445
No, he's my son. He was taken by these divers.

375
00:22:51,112 --> 00:22:52,989
You poor fish.

376
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:56,367
- Humans. Think they own everything. - Probably American.

377
00:22:56,451 --> 00:23:00,496
There is a father looking for his little boy.

378
00:23:00,955 --> 00:23:02,624
What do these markings mean?

379
00:23:02,707 --> 00:23:06,586
- I never knew my father. - Come here.

380
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:08,796
- We're all mates here. - I can't read human.

381
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,966
Then we've got to find a fish that can read this. Look. Sharks!

382
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:14,385
- Guys. - No, Dory.

383
00:23:14,469 --> 00:23:16,846
- That's mine. Give it back. - Cut it out.

384
00:23:17,513 --> 00:23:20,600
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

385
00:23:20,683 --> 00:23:23,519
You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding?

386
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:27,023
Dory, are you oka...

387
00:23:30,193 --> 00:23:31,694
That's good.

388
00:23:32,195 --> 00:23:33,571
Intervention!

389
00:23:34,322 --> 00:23:37,283
- Just a bite. - You hold it together, mate.

390
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:40,203
- Fish are friends, not food. - Food!

391
00:23:41,037 --> 00:23:42,789
Dory, look out.

392
00:23:42,872 --> 00:23:45,750
I'm having fish tonight.

393
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,126
Remember the steps, mate.

394
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:54,175
Just one bite.

395
00:23:58,721 --> 00:23:59,764
G'day.

396
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:06,062
There's no way out. There's got to be a way to escape.

397
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,025
- Who is it? - Help me find a way out.

398
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:13,903
Sorry. You'll have to come back later. We're trying to escape.

399
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:17,407
There's no way out. There's got to be a way out.

400
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,661
Here's something. "Es-ca-pé." I wonder what that means.

401
00:24:21,744 --> 00:24:23,830
- It's spelled just like the word "escape." - Let's go.

402
00:24:24,414 --> 00:24:26,999
Here's Brucie!

403
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,129
- Wait a minute. You can read? - I can read? That's right!

404
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:32,714
Then here. Read this now.

405
00:24:34,757 --> 00:24:37,719
He doesn't mean it. He never even knew his father.

406
00:24:37,802 --> 00:24:39,846
Don't fall off the wagon.

407
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,393
Oh, no! It's blocked.

408
00:24:49,814 --> 00:24:51,065
No, Bruce!

409
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:53,609
Sorry about... Bruce, mate.

410
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,862
He's really... A nice guy.

411
00:24:55,945 --> 00:24:57,530
I need to get that mask.

412
00:24:57,613 --> 00:24:59,073
You want that mask? Okay.

413
00:24:59,157 --> 00:25:01,534
No, no, no, no!

414
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,162
Quick. Grab the mask.

415
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:11,210
Oh, no. Bruce.

416
00:25:11,294 --> 00:25:12,462
What?

417
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,383
Swim away!

418
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:18,885
Is the party over?

419
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,062
Nice.

420
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,026
Dad!

421
00:25:37,695 --> 00:25:39,071
Daddy?

422
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:03,262
Barbara.

423
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:05,139
Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please?

424
00:26:05,515 --> 00:26:08,643
- And I'll need more cotton rolls. - All right.

425
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:12,772
Hello, little fella.

426
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,191
Beauty, isn't he?

427
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:18,778
I found that guy struggling for life and I saved him.

428
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:20,947
Has that Novocain kicked in yet?

429
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:26,410
Bubbles!

430
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:32,917
- My bubbles. - He likes bubbles.

431
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:49,976
Slow down, little fella. There's nothing to worry about.

432
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:52,270
- He's scared to death. - I want to go home.

433
00:26:53,187 --> 00:26:54,605
Do you know where my dad is?

434
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:57,316
Your dad's probably back at the pet store.

435
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,734
Pet store?

436
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:01,946
- Like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart. - Pet Palace.

437
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:03,447
- Fish-O-Rama. - Mail order.

438
00:27:03,531 --> 00:27:04,782
eBay.

439
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:07,326
- Which one is it? - I'm from the ocean.

440
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,453
The ocean. The ocean!

441
00:27:11,122 --> 00:27:14,041
He hasn't been decontaminated yet. Jacques!

442
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,459
Clean him!

443
00:27:17,044 --> 00:27:18,588
Ocean.

444
00:27:21,424 --> 00:27:22,925
Voilà. He is clean.

445
00:27:25,928 --> 00:27:29,056
Wow. The big blue. What's it like?

446
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,893
Big and blue?

447
00:27:31,976 --> 00:27:33,019
I knew it.

448
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:36,522
If there's anything you need, ask your Auntie Deb. That's me.

449
00:27:36,606 --> 00:27:41,193
If I'm not around you can always talk to my sister, Flo. Hi. How are you?

450
00:27:41,277 --> 00:27:44,405
Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's nuts.

451
00:27:45,615 --> 00:27:48,576
- Can't hear you, Peach. - I said we got a live one.

452
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,036
- Yes! - Boy, oh, boy.

453
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:52,288
- What have we got? - Root canal.

454
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:53,623
It's not going to be pretty.

455
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:56,876
- Clamp installed? - Yup.

456
00:27:56,959 --> 00:28:00,379
- What did he use to open? - Glidden drill. He favours that one.

457
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,382
I can't see, Flo.

458
00:28:05,635 --> 00:28:08,220
- Schilder Technique. - That's a Hedstrom file.

459
00:28:08,304 --> 00:28:10,765
That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K-Flex.

460
00:28:10,848 --> 00:28:13,851
It's got a teardrop cross section. A Hedstrom.

461
00:28:13,935 --> 00:28:16,604
- K-Flex! - Hedstrom!

462
00:28:16,687 --> 00:28:18,773
There I go. Little help. Over here.

463
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:20,733
I'll go deflate him.

464
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:24,946
All right. Go ahead and rinse.

465
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:28,324
The human mouth is a disgusting place.

466
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,787
- Nigel. - What did I miss?

467
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,873
- Root canal. A doozy. - What did he use to open?

468
00:28:35,957 --> 00:28:37,625
- Glidden drill. - He favours it.

469
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:40,878
Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer at the portal terminus.

470
00:28:40,962 --> 00:28:43,923
- Hello. Who's this? - New guy.

471
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:46,592
- The dentist took him off the reef. - An outie.

472
00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:49,428
From my neck of the woods? Sorry if I took a snap at you.

473
00:28:49,512 --> 00:28:51,764
Fish got to swim. Birds got to eat.

474
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:56,227
No, no. Those aren't your fish. They're my fish. Come on. Go. Shoo.

475
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,233
The picture broke. This here's Darla. She's my niece.

476
00:29:02,316 --> 00:29:03,359
Going to be eight this week.

477
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:06,612
Hey, little fella. Say hello to your new mummy.

478
00:29:06,696 --> 00:29:09,115
She's going to be here Friday to pick you up.

479
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:11,033
You're her present.

480
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:13,077
It's our little secret.

481
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,453
Well, Mr Tucker,

482
00:29:14,537 --> 00:29:17,873
while that sets up, I'm going to go see a man about a wallaby.

483
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,626
Darla!

484
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:24,380
- What's wrong with her? - She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.

485
00:29:25,673 --> 00:29:28,926
- Poor Chuckles. - He was her present last year.

486
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,721
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.

487
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:35,266
She's a fish killer.

488
00:29:36,225 --> 00:29:39,854
I can't go with that girl. I have to get back to my dad.

489
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,233
- Daddy! Help me! - He's stuck.

490
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,240
Nobody touch him.

491
00:29:57,204 --> 00:29:58,497
Can you help me?

492
00:29:58,581 --> 00:30:01,917
No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out.

493
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:04,754
- Gill... - I just want to see him do it, okay?

494
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:08,340
Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail.

495
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:11,343
I can't. I have a bad fin.

496
00:30:11,427 --> 00:30:13,137
Never stopped me.

497
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,769
Just think about what you need to do.

498
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,357
Come on.

499
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:30,696
Perfect.

500
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,616
- You did it. - Good squirming.

501
00:30:34,784 --> 00:30:37,912
Wow, from the ocean! Just like you, Gill.

502
00:30:37,995 --> 00:30:39,205
Yeah.

503
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:43,250
I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about?

504
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:48,297
I'm thinking tonight we give the kid a proper reception.

505
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:51,675
- So, kid, you got a name or what? - Nemo.

506
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,177
I'm Nemo.

507
00:30:54,345 --> 00:30:55,596
Nemo.

508
00:30:56,806 --> 00:30:58,099
Nemo.

509
00:31:02,812 --> 00:31:04,814
You going to eat that?

510
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:17,785
Careful of that hammer.

511
00:31:26,794 --> 00:31:28,629
- Dory! - Sea-Monkey has my money.

512
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:30,965
Wake up. Get up.

513
00:31:31,048 --> 00:31:33,634
- Come on. - Yes, I'm a natural blue.

514
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:35,511
- Get up! - Look out. Sharks eat fish!

515
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:01,537
Wow. Dusty.

516
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:04,415
The mask. Where's the mask?

517
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,418
No! The mask! Get it!

518
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:09,420
Get the mask! Get it!

519
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:21,223
Keeps going on, doesn't it?

520
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:23,142
Echo! Echo!

521
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:26,270
- What are you doing? - I've lost the mask.

522
00:32:26,353 --> 00:32:28,272
- Did you drop it? - You dropped it!

523
00:32:28,355 --> 00:32:30,900
That was my only chance of finding my son. Now it's gone.

524
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,323
Hey, Mr Grumpy Gills.

525
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:41,285
- When you're down, know what to do? - I don't want to know.

526
00:32:41,368 --> 00:32:43,662
Just keep swimming.

527
00:32:43,746 --> 00:32:46,332
Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming

528
00:32:46,415 --> 00:32:48,667
What do we do? We swim

529
00:32:48,751 --> 00:32:50,502
Dory, no singing.

530
00:32:51,212 --> 00:32:53,297
I love to swim

531
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,967
And when you want to swim you want to...

532
00:32:57,051 --> 00:33:00,012
I'm going to get stuck with that song. It's in my head!

533
00:33:00,095 --> 00:33:01,263
Sorry.

534
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:05,392
- See anything? - Something's got me!

535
00:33:05,476 --> 00:33:07,436
- That was me. Sorry. - Who's that?

536
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,772
Who could it be? It's me.

537
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:12,483
Are... Are you my conscience?

538
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:15,694
Yeah. I'm your conscience.

539
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:18,614
We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?

540
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,741
- Can't complain. - Good.

541
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:24,328
Now, Dory, I want you to tell me, do you see anything?

542
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:26,288
I see a...

543
00:33:27,164 --> 00:33:28,791
- I see a light. - A light?

544
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:31,001
Yeah. Over there.

545
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:32,795
Hey, conscience, am I dead?

546
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:34,380
I see it, too.

547
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:43,347
What is it?

548
00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:46,809
It's so pretty!

549
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,145
I...

550
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:52,481
I'm feeling happy.

551
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:56,944
Which is a big deal for me.

552
00:33:57,027 --> 00:33:58,779
I want to touch it.

553
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:02,449
Hey, come back. Come on back here.

554
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:04,368
I'm going to get you.

555
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:06,328
I'm going to get you.

556
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:08,247
I'm going to swim with you

557
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,083
I'm going to be your best friend

558
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,501
Good feeling's gone.

559
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:22,052
I can't see. I don't know where I'm going.

560
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:26,015
- The mask! - What mask?

561
00:34:27,182 --> 00:34:29,268
Okay. I can't see a thing.

562
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:31,061
Whoa, geez.

563
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:33,188
- Look. A mask. - Read it!

564
00:34:34,356 --> 00:34:38,277
I'm sorry, but if you could bring it a little closer. I need the light.

565
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,446
That's great. Keep it right there.

566
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:43,365
- Just read it! - Okay, okay.

567
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,908
Mr Bossy.

568
00:34:45,743 --> 00:34:47,453
"P." Okay. P.

569
00:34:47,536 --> 00:34:49,121
"Sher..."

570
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:51,790
P. Sher... P. Shirley...

571
00:34:51,874 --> 00:34:53,375
P not Shirley.

572
00:34:54,585 --> 00:34:56,462
The first line's "P. Sherman."

573
00:34:56,545 --> 00:34:59,131
"P. Sherman" doesn't make any sense!

574
00:34:59,214 --> 00:35:00,591
Second line.

575
00:35:00,674 --> 00:35:02,217
"42..."

576
00:35:05,095 --> 00:35:07,014
Light, please.

577
00:35:07,097 --> 00:35:10,726
"Walla... Wallaby."

578
00:35:13,354 --> 00:35:15,814
The second line's "42 Wallaby Way."

579
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:18,984
Just finish up. Speed read. No pressure.

580
00:35:19,068 --> 00:35:22,071
There's a lot of pressure! Take a guess, with pressure.

581
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:24,573
- Sydney. It's Sydney! - Duck!

582
00:35:28,744 --> 00:35:30,704
I'm dead. I'm dead.

583
00:35:30,788 --> 00:35:32,581
I died. I'm dead.

584
00:35:40,881 --> 00:35:42,508
We did it, we did it

585
00:35:42,591 --> 00:35:44,259
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

586
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:47,513
No eating here tonight, eating here tonight

587
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:50,349
No eating here tonight You're on a diet

588
00:35:50,432 --> 00:35:53,310
Dory. What did it say? What did the mask say?

589
00:35:53,394 --> 00:35:55,938
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

590
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:59,400
I remembered what it said! I forget things, but I remembered it.

591
00:35:59,483 --> 00:36:01,527
- P. Sherman... - Where is that?

592
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,154
I don't know. But who cares? I remembered.

593
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:09,326
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered it again!

594
00:36:38,605 --> 00:36:40,023
Nemo.

595
00:36:40,983 --> 00:36:42,693
Nemo!

596
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,950
Follow me.

597
00:36:49,950 --> 00:37:19,950
Subtitle www.movieddl.me

598
00:37:47,883 --> 00:37:49,218
State your name.

599
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:51,303
Nemo.

600
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,764
Brother Bloat, proceed.

601
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:58,769
Nemo, newcomer of orange and white.

602
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:03,273
You have been called forth to the summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie

603
00:38:03,357 --> 00:38:08,070
to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tank hood.

604
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,157
- We want you in our club, kid. - Really?

605
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:15,994
If you are able to swim through

606
00:38:16,078 --> 00:38:19,581
the Ring of Fire!

607
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:27,047
Turn on the Ring of Fire. You said you could do it.

608
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,924
The Ring of Fire!

609
00:38:31,301 --> 00:38:33,178
Bubbles. Let me...

610
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,855
Isn't there another way? He's just a boy.

611
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:59,329
From this moment on, you will now be known as Sharkbait.

612
00:38:59,413 --> 00:39:00,706
Sharkbait!

613
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:02,499
Welcome, Brother Sharkbait.

614
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:03,792
Sharkbait.

615
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,628
- Enough with the Sharkbait. - Sharkbait...

616
00:39:07,796 --> 00:39:10,048
- Sharkbait's one of us now. - Agreed.

617
00:39:10,132 --> 00:39:13,552
We can't send him to his death. Darla's coming in five days.

618
00:39:13,635 --> 00:39:15,137
So what are we going to do?

619
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:18,098
I'll tell you.

620
00:39:18,181 --> 00:39:20,892
We're going to get him out of here. We'll help him escape.

621
00:39:20,976 --> 00:39:23,437
- Escape? Really? - We're all going to escape.

622
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:26,106
Not another one of your escape plans.

623
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:28,233
Sorry, but they never work.

624
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:29,776
Yeah, why should this be any different?

625
00:39:30,277 --> 00:39:33,238
- 'Cause we've got him. - Me?

626
00:39:33,322 --> 00:39:34,990
- You see that filter? - Yeah.

627
00:39:35,324 --> 00:39:38,785
You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing.

628
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:43,081
We need you to take a pebble inside there and jam the gears.

629
00:39:43,165 --> 00:39:46,960
You do that and this tank's going to get filthier by the minute.

630
00:39:47,044 --> 00:39:49,713
Soon the dentist will have to clean the tank.

631
00:39:49,796 --> 00:39:53,925
When he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in individual baggies,

632
00:39:54,009 --> 00:39:56,928
then we'll roll down the counter, out of the window,

633
00:39:57,012 --> 00:40:00,515
off the awning, into the bushes, across the street and into the harbour.

634
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,185
It's foolproof.

635
00:40:03,727 --> 00:40:06,271
- Who's with me? - I.

636
00:40:06,355 --> 00:40:08,190
I think you're nuts.

637
00:40:08,565 --> 00:40:11,526
No offence, kid, but you're not the best swimmer.

638
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,363
He's fine. He can do this.

639
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:17,574
So, Sharkbait, what do you think?

640
00:40:17,658 --> 00:40:18,867
Let's do it!

641
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:26,583
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where are you going?

642
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:28,960
To P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

643
00:40:29,044 --> 00:40:31,380
If you ask where I'm going, I'll tell you.

644
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:36,802
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where? I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

645
00:40:36,885 --> 00:40:40,097
Excuse me. Excuse me.

646
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,516
Hi. Do you know how to get... Hello?

647
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,352
Wait. Can you tell me... Hey!

648
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:46,812
Hold it!

649
00:40:46,895 --> 00:40:48,855
Wait a minute. I'm trying to talk to you.

650
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:51,483
Okay, fellas. Come back here.

651
00:40:51,566 --> 00:40:55,404
One quick question. I need to... And they're gone again.

652
00:40:56,405 --> 00:40:58,824
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

653
00:40:58,907 --> 00:41:01,076
Why do I have to tell you again?

654
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,663
- I don't get tired of it. - All right, here's the thing.

655
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:09,960
I think it's best if I carry on from here by...

656
00:41:11,128 --> 00:41:13,422
- By myself. - Okay.

657
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:15,048
You know. Alone.

658
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:20,053
Without... Well, not without you, but I don't want you with me.

659
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:24,224
I don't want to hurt your feelings.

660
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:27,018
- You want me to leave? - Well, not... Yes. Yeah.

661
00:41:27,102 --> 00:41:29,688
I just can't afford any more delays.

662
00:41:29,771 --> 00:41:32,649
You're one of those fish that cause delays.

663
00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:35,777
Sometimes it's a good thing. There's a group of fish.

664
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:38,321
- They're delay fish. - You mean...

665
00:41:39,156 --> 00:41:42,659
- You mean you don't like me? - Of course I like you.

666
00:41:42,743 --> 00:41:45,203
Because I like you I don't want to be with you.

667
00:41:45,287 --> 00:41:47,456
It's a complicated emotion.

668
00:41:48,957 --> 00:41:51,293
Don't cry. I like you.

669
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:52,502
Hey, you!

670
00:41:53,253 --> 00:41:55,589
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

671
00:41:55,672 --> 00:41:59,593
- I don't remember. Were you? - No, no. We're just...

672
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:01,553
Do you guys know how I can get...

673
00:42:01,636 --> 00:42:05,348
We're talking to the lady, not you. You like impressions?

674
00:42:07,017 --> 00:42:09,936
Okay. Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen.

675
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,730
What are we? Take a guess.

676
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:14,858
- I've seen one of those. - I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

677
00:42:14,983 --> 00:42:16,902
- Wait. - It's a swordfish.

678
00:42:16,985 --> 00:42:19,571
Hey, clown-boy, let the lady guess.

679
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,573
Where's the butter?

680
00:42:22,115 --> 00:42:23,909
- It's on the tip of my tongue. - Lobster.

681
00:42:23,992 --> 00:42:25,410
- Saw that. - What?

682
00:42:25,494 --> 00:42:27,537
- Lots of legs. - Clam?

683
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:28,830
Close enough.

684
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:31,374
It's a whale of a tale I'll tell you, lad

685
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:33,710
- They're good. - Somebody give me directions?

686
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:37,589
"Would somebody give me directions?"

687
00:42:37,672 --> 00:42:40,008
- I'm serious. - Blah, blah, me, me.

688
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:41,551
Blah, blah, blah, me, me.

689
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:43,220
Thank you.

690
00:42:43,303 --> 00:42:45,514
Oh, dear. Hey, come back.

691
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:48,433
What's the matter?

692
00:42:48,517 --> 00:42:50,644
While they're doing impressions,

693
00:42:50,727 --> 00:42:52,270
I am miles from home

694
00:42:52,354 --> 00:42:54,397
with a fish that can't even remember her own name.

695
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:57,234
- I bet that's frustrating. - My son is out there.

696
00:42:57,317 --> 00:42:59,236
- Your son Chico? - Nemo.

697
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:02,948
It doesn't matter. 'Cause no fish in this ocean is going to help me.

698
00:43:03,031 --> 00:43:04,699
I'm helping you.

699
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,370
Wait right here.

700
00:43:09,704 --> 00:43:11,790
- Guys. - Is he bothering you again?

701
00:43:11,873 --> 00:43:13,458
No, he's a good guy.

702
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:15,919
Go easy on him. He's lost his son Fabio.

703
00:43:16,002 --> 00:43:18,505
Heard of P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

704
00:43:18,588 --> 00:43:20,966
Sydney? Oh, sure.

705
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:23,969
Ted here's got relatives in Sydney. Don't you, Ted?

706
00:43:24,052 --> 00:43:27,430
- Sure do. - Hey, they know Sydney!

707
00:43:27,514 --> 00:43:31,142
- You wouldn't know how to get there? - Follow the EAC.

708
00:43:31,226 --> 00:43:33,812
That's East Australian Current.

709
00:43:33,895 --> 00:43:36,982
Big current. You can't miss it. It's in

710
00:43:37,065 --> 00:43:38,525
that direction.

711
00:43:38,608 --> 00:43:41,152
Then you got to follow that for about...

712
00:43:41,236 --> 00:43:43,989
What do you guys think? Three leagues?

713
00:43:44,072 --> 00:43:47,158
That baby's going to float you right past Sydney.

714
00:43:47,242 --> 00:43:48,743
Great! That's great!

715
00:43:48,827 --> 00:43:50,871
- Dory, you did it. - Oh, please.

716
00:43:50,954 --> 00:43:53,164
I'm just your little helper. Helping along.

717
00:43:53,248 --> 00:43:55,500
- Fellas, thank you. - Don't mention it.

718
00:43:55,584 --> 00:43:58,044
Just loosen up. Okay, buddy?

719
00:43:58,128 --> 00:44:01,214
You guys! You really nailed him. Bye.

720
00:44:01,298 --> 00:44:02,883
- Ma'am. One more thing. - Yes?

721
00:44:02,966 --> 00:44:06,595
When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.

722
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:09,764
Trench. Through it. Not over it. I'll remember.

723
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:11,099
Hey!

724
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:14,811
Wait up, partner. Hold on.

725
00:44:15,437 --> 00:44:18,732
Wait. I've got to tell you something. Whoa.

726
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:22,402
Nice trench.

727
00:44:24,779 --> 00:44:26,865
Hello!

728
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:33,038
- Let's go. - No, no. Bad trench. Bad trench.

729
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:37,083
- We're going to swim over this thing. - Little red flag going up.

730
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:40,211
Something's telling me we should swim through it.

731
00:44:40,295 --> 00:44:43,423
Are you looking at this thing? It's got death written on it.

732
00:44:43,506 --> 00:44:46,301
I'm sorry, but I think we should swim through.

733
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:48,511
I'm done talking about this. Over we go.

734
00:44:48,595 --> 00:44:50,013
Come on. Trust me on this.

735
00:44:50,096 --> 00:44:52,474
- Trust you? - Yes. Trust. It's what friends do.

736
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:54,976
- Something shiny! - Where?

737
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,021
- It just swam over the trench. Come on. - Okay.

738
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:05,987
- Boy, it sure is clear up here. - Exactly.

739
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:07,280
And look at that.

740
00:45:07,364 --> 00:45:10,659
There's the current. We should be there in no time.

741
00:45:11,117 --> 00:45:14,245
- Hey, little guy. - You wanted to go through the trench.

742
00:45:14,329 --> 00:45:18,750
I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine. Come here, Squishy.

743
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,877
Come here, little Squishy.

744
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:26,967
- That's a jellyfish! - Bad Squishy.

745
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,426
Shoo! Get away.

746
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,387
- Let me see. - Don't touch it.

747
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,931
I'm not going to touch it. I just want to look.

748
00:45:33,014 --> 00:45:34,891
How come it didn't sting you?

749
00:45:34,975 --> 00:45:37,435
It did. Hold still.

750
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:42,774
I live in this anemone and I'm used to these kind of stings. Come here.

751
00:45:42,857 --> 00:45:44,901
You're going to be fine.

752
00:45:44,985 --> 00:45:48,279
But now we know that we don't want to touch these again.

753
00:45:48,363 --> 00:45:50,907
Let's be thankful it was just a little one.

754
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:55,537
Don't move.

755
00:45:57,706 --> 00:45:59,666
This is bad, Dory.

756
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:03,920
- Boing. Boing. - Dory!

757
00:46:04,004 --> 00:46:05,672
You can't catch me.

758
00:46:05,755 --> 00:46:08,383
Don't bounce on the tops. They will

759
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:10,301
not sting you!

760
00:46:10,385 --> 00:46:13,722
- The tops don't sting you. - Two in a row. Beat that.

761
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:15,432
Listen to me. I have an idea.

762
00:46:15,515 --> 00:46:17,308
- A game. - A game?

763
00:46:17,392 --> 00:46:19,060
I love games. Pick me.

764
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:23,690
Here's the game. Whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish wins.

765
00:46:23,773 --> 00:46:25,316
- Okay! - Rules.

766
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,902
Don't touch the tentacles. Only the tops.

767
00:46:27,986 --> 00:46:31,573
Something about tentacles. Got it. On your mark. Get set. Go!

768
00:46:32,907 --> 00:46:34,451
Wait!

769
00:46:34,534 --> 00:46:36,578
Go faster if you want to win.

770
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:39,080
- Dory! - Boing, boing, boing!

771
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,125
Wait a minute.

772
00:46:44,544 --> 00:46:46,337
So, we're cheating death now.

773
00:46:46,421 --> 00:46:49,007
We're having fun at the same time.

774
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:50,800
I can do this. Just be careful.

775
00:46:50,884 --> 00:46:52,552
Careful I don't make you cry when I win.

776
00:46:52,635 --> 00:46:54,095
I don't think so!

777
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:00,769
Give it up. You can't fight evolution. I was built for speed.

778
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:03,313
- The question is, are you hungry? - Hungry?

779
00:47:03,396 --> 00:47:05,899
Yeah. 'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles!

780
00:47:06,566 --> 00:47:09,527
Duck to the left, back and coming over, right there!

781
00:47:11,613 --> 00:47:14,407
The clown fish is the winner!

782
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:16,951
We did it. Look at us!

783
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:18,286
Dory?

784
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:21,790
Oh, no.

785
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:27,087
Dory! Dory! Dory!

786
00:47:29,964 --> 00:47:31,549
Dory!

787
00:47:37,097 --> 00:47:38,556
Am I disqualified?

788
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,725
You're doing fine. You're winning.

789
00:47:40,809 --> 00:47:43,561
Stay awake. Where does P. Sherman live?

790
00:47:43,645 --> 00:47:46,815
P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney.

791
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:48,358
That's it!

792
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:54,656
Stay awake. Stay awake. Stay awake.

793
00:47:54,989 --> 00:47:57,951
Stay awake!

794
00:48:01,663 --> 00:48:04,082
- Awake... - P. Sherman...

795
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:07,293
- Awake... - 42 Wallaby Way...

796
00:48:08,128 --> 00:48:10,046
- Wake up. - Sydney.

797
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,172
Nemo...

798
00:48:26,479 --> 00:48:28,731
You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait?

799
00:48:28,815 --> 00:48:29,941
Yeah.

800
00:48:30,024 --> 00:48:33,903
Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's looking for you.

801
00:48:33,987 --> 00:48:36,156
He's not looking for me.

802
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:38,324
He's scared of the ocean.

803
00:48:39,868 --> 00:48:41,202
Peach? Any movement?

804
00:48:41,286 --> 00:48:43,955
He's had four cups of coffee. It's got to be soon.

805
00:48:44,205 --> 00:48:45,707
Keep on him.

806
00:48:48,376 --> 00:48:51,171
My first escape, landed on dental tools.

807
00:48:51,254 --> 00:48:53,631
- I was aiming for the toilet. - The toilet?

808
00:48:53,715 --> 00:48:56,593
All drains lead to the ocean, kid.

809
00:48:56,676 --> 00:48:59,679
Wow. How many times have you tried to get out?

810
00:48:59,762 --> 00:49:04,809
I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to you.

811
00:49:04,893 --> 00:49:06,978
The bubbles, the bubbles!

812
00:49:07,061 --> 00:49:11,149
Potty break! He just grabbed the Reader's Digest. We have 4.2 minutes.

813
00:49:11,232 --> 00:49:12,817
That's your cue.

814
00:49:12,901 --> 00:49:15,278
- You can do it, kid. - We got to be quick.

815
00:49:15,361 --> 00:49:19,657
Once you get in, swim to the bottom and I'll talk you through the rest.

816
00:49:19,741 --> 00:49:20,742
Okay.

817
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:23,203
Go on. It'll be a piece of kelp.

818
00:49:31,377 --> 00:49:34,005
- Nicely done. Can you hear me? - Yeah.

819
00:49:34,088 --> 00:49:36,007
Here comes the pebble.

820
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:45,725
Now, do you see a small opening?

821
00:49:45,808 --> 00:49:48,937
Okay. Inside it you'll see a rotating fan.

822
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:53,441
Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning.

823
00:49:57,987 --> 00:49:59,364
Careful, Sharkbait.

824
00:49:59,447 --> 00:50:02,116
- I can't do it. - This isn't a good idea.

825
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,910
He'll be fine. Try again!

826
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:05,578
Okay.

827
00:50:06,621 --> 00:50:09,332
That's it, Sharkbait.

828
00:50:09,415 --> 00:50:11,668
Nice and steady.

829
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:17,131
- I got it, I got it! - He did it.

830
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:20,426
That's great, kid. Now swim up the tube and out.

831
00:50:37,986 --> 00:50:39,988
Oh, no! Gill!

832
00:50:40,697 --> 00:50:42,991
Sharkbait! Get him out of there!

833
00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:44,575
- Help him! - What do we do?

834
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:47,537
- Oh, no! - Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic.

835
00:50:49,038 --> 00:50:52,208
- Help me! - Sharkbait, grab hold of this.

836
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,921
No!

837
00:50:57,005 --> 00:50:58,923
- Feed me more. - That's it!

838
00:50:59,007 --> 00:51:01,134
Come on, Sharkbait. Grab it.

839
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,721
- I got it. - Pull!

840
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,856
Gill, don't make him go back in there.

841
00:51:16,357 --> 00:51:19,694
No. We're done.

842
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,293
Dude?

843
00:51:36,586 --> 00:51:37,920
Dude?

844
00:51:38,713 --> 00:51:40,506
Focus, dude.

845
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:42,550
Dude?

846
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:45,845
He lives. Hey, dude.

847
00:51:48,598 --> 00:51:51,559
- What happened? - I saw the whole thing, dude.

848
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:55,063
First you were all, like, whoa! And then we were all, like, whoa!

849
00:51:55,146 --> 00:51:58,358
- Then you were, like, whoa... - What are you talking about?

850
00:51:58,441 --> 00:52:05,323
You, mini-man! Taking on the jellies. You got serious thrill issues, dude.

851
00:52:05,406 --> 00:52:06,616
Awesome.

852
00:52:07,075 --> 00:52:08,576
Oh, my stomach.

853
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:12,455
Man, no hurling on the shell. I just waxed it.

854
00:52:13,706 --> 00:52:17,001
- So, Mr Turtle... - Dude, Mr Turtle is my father.

855
00:52:17,085 --> 00:52:18,586
Name's Crush.

856
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,671
Crush? Really?

857
00:52:21,255 --> 00:52:22,507
Okay, Crush.

858
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:25,968
Listen, I need to get to the East Australian Current.

859
00:52:26,052 --> 00:52:27,512
EAC?

860
00:52:27,595 --> 00:52:29,138
Dude...

861
00:52:29,222 --> 00:52:31,391
You're riding it, dude.

862
00:52:31,474 --> 00:52:33,267
Check it out.

863
00:52:55,248 --> 00:52:56,749
Okay, grab shell, dude.

864
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:59,043
Grab what?

865
00:53:08,803 --> 00:53:10,555
Righteous! Righteous!

866
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,019
So,

867
00:53:17,854 --> 00:53:21,607
what brings you on this fine day to the EAC?

868
00:53:21,691 --> 00:53:24,694
Well, Dory and I need to get to Sydney.

869
00:53:24,777 --> 00:53:26,988
Dory! Is she all right?

870
00:53:27,447 --> 00:53:29,615
Oh, little blue.

871
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:30,867
She is sub-level, dude.

872
00:53:35,121 --> 00:53:37,081
Dory, Dory! Dory!

873
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,250
Oh, Dory.

874
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:43,838
I'm so sorry.

875
00:53:44,505 --> 00:53:47,383
This is all my fault. It's my fault.

876
00:53:47,467 --> 00:53:50,470
...twenty-nine, 30! Ready or not, here I come!

877
00:53:53,181 --> 00:53:54,307
There you are.

878
00:53:55,016 --> 00:53:56,517
Catch me if you can.

879
00:54:06,527 --> 00:54:08,321
Up you go!

880
00:54:18,831 --> 00:54:20,124
Oh, my goodness.

881
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:24,295
Kill the motor, dude. Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.

882
00:54:33,137 --> 00:54:35,932
Whoa! That was so cool.

883
00:54:36,015 --> 00:54:38,809
Hey, Dad. Did you see that? Did you see me?

884
00:54:38,893 --> 00:54:43,064
- Did you see what I did? - You so totally rock, Squirt.

885
00:54:43,147 --> 00:54:44,815
Give me some fin.

886
00:54:44,899 --> 00:54:45,983
Noggin.

887
00:54:46,067 --> 00:54:47,401
Dude.

888
00:54:48,236 --> 00:54:52,907
Intro. Jellyman, Offspring. Offspring, Jellyman.

889
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:56,452
- Jellies? Sweet. - Totally.

890
00:54:56,536 --> 00:54:59,747
I must have done something you all liked, dudes.

891
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,415
You rock, dude.

892
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:05,044
Curl away, my son.

893
00:55:05,127 --> 00:55:07,004
It's awesome, Jellyman.

894
00:55:07,088 --> 00:55:10,466
When the little dudes are eggs we leave them on a beach to hatch,

895
00:55:10,758 --> 00:55:14,512
and coo-coo-cachoo, they find their way back to the big ol' blue.

896
00:55:14,595 --> 00:55:16,681
- All by themselves? - Yeah!

897
00:55:16,764 --> 00:55:19,684
But, dude, how do you know when they're ready?

898
00:55:19,767 --> 00:55:23,938
You never really know, but when they know, you'll know. You know?

899
00:55:28,818 --> 00:55:31,362
- Hey, look, everybody. - I know that dude.

900
00:55:31,445 --> 00:55:32,738
It's the Jellyman.

901
00:55:33,447 --> 00:55:36,242
- Well go on. Jump on him. - Turtle pile!

902
00:55:36,325 --> 00:55:38,035
Wait. Kids!

903
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:39,996
- You funny? - Where's your shell?

904
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,373
- Do your stripes come off? - I need to breathe.

905
00:55:42,456 --> 00:55:44,667
Did you cross the jellyfish forest?

906
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,753
- One at a time. - Mr Fish, did you die?

907
00:55:47,837 --> 00:55:49,964
Sorry. I was vague on the details.

908
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:53,551
- So where are you going? - You see, my son was taken.

909
00:55:53,634 --> 00:55:55,886
My son was taken away from me.

910
00:55:56,762 --> 00:55:58,681
- No way! - What happened?

911
00:55:58,764 --> 00:56:01,726
No, kids. I don't want to talk about it.

912
00:56:01,809 --> 00:56:04,312
- Come on. - Please.

913
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:06,731
Well, okay.

914
00:56:07,523 --> 00:56:11,027
I live on this reef, a long way from here.

915
00:56:11,277 --> 00:56:13,362
This is going to be good. I can tell.

916
00:56:13,446 --> 00:56:17,575
My son, Nemo, he was mad at me.

917
00:56:18,326 --> 00:56:20,995
Maybe he wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been so tough on him.

918
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:22,413
I don't know.

919
00:56:22,496 --> 00:56:24,915
He swam in the open water to this boat

920
00:56:24,999 --> 00:56:28,461
and these divers appeared and I tried to stop them.

921
00:56:28,544 --> 00:56:31,422
The boat was too fast, so we swam out in the ocean...

922
00:56:31,505 --> 00:56:32,673
He couldn't stop them.

923
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:35,551
Then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean

924
00:56:35,635 --> 00:56:37,887
and they bump into three sharks.

925
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:40,389
He scares them away by blowing them up.

926
00:56:40,473 --> 00:56:43,184
- That's amazing. - Then dives thousands of feet...

927
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:47,438
Straight into the dark. It's wicked dark there. You can't see a thing.

928
00:56:47,521 --> 00:56:49,982
The only thing they can see down there is...

929
00:56:50,066 --> 00:56:53,778
This big, horrible creature with razor-sharp teeth! Nice parry.

930
00:56:53,861 --> 00:56:55,363
Then he has to blast his way...

931
00:56:55,446 --> 00:56:58,407
These fish have been searching the ocean for days

932
00:56:58,491 --> 00:57:00,284
on the East Australian Current.

933
00:57:00,368 --> 00:57:02,411
He may be on his way here right now.

934
00:57:02,495 --> 00:57:04,121
That should put him in Sydney Harbour...

935
00:57:04,205 --> 00:57:05,581
In a few days.

936
00:57:05,665 --> 00:57:07,625
This guy will stop at nothing...

937
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:10,503
...stop at nothing until he finds his son. I hope he makes it.

938
00:57:10,586 --> 00:57:13,422
That's one dedicated father, if you ask me.

939
00:57:20,054 --> 00:57:22,556
Mine. Mine. Mine.

940
00:57:28,688 --> 00:57:31,399
Would you just shut up?

941
00:57:31,482 --> 00:57:35,277
- You're rats with wings. - This bloke's looking for his boy, Nemo.

942
00:57:35,361 --> 00:57:39,031
- He was taken off the reef by divers... - There. Take it.

943
00:57:40,074 --> 00:57:42,660
Say that again. You said something about Nemo.

944
00:57:42,743 --> 00:57:44,453
Mine. Mine. Mine.

945
00:57:47,248 --> 00:57:48,249
Mine.

946
00:57:48,332 --> 00:57:51,502
Last I heard, he's heading towards the harbour.

947
00:57:51,585 --> 00:57:52,920
Brilliant!

948
00:58:06,726 --> 00:58:08,102
Is he doing okay?

949
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:11,439
I don't know, but whatever you do, don't mention D-A-R...

950
00:58:11,522 --> 00:58:14,567
It's okay. I know who you're talking about.

951
00:58:22,867 --> 00:58:24,118
Gill?

952
00:58:26,495 --> 00:58:27,580
Gill?

953
00:58:29,081 --> 00:58:30,291
Hey, Sharkbait.

954
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:34,754
- I'm sorry I couldn't stop... - I'm the one who should be sorry.

955
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:40,259
I was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that ocean,

956
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:43,637
I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there.

957
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:47,141
Nothing should be worth that.

958
00:58:48,642 --> 00:58:50,978
I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid.

959
00:58:55,274 --> 00:58:57,276
All right. Hey, hey, hey!

960
00:58:58,027 --> 00:58:59,487
What the...

961
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:02,156
Well, that's one way to pull a tooth.

962
00:59:04,658 --> 00:59:08,662
Darn kids. Well, good thing I pulled the right one, eh?

963
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,208
Nigel, you just missed an extraction.

964
00:59:12,291 --> 00:59:15,002
Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet?

965
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:17,254
What am I talking about? Where's Nemo?

966
00:59:17,338 --> 00:59:18,964
I've got to speak with him.

967
00:59:19,048 --> 00:59:22,092
Your dad's been fighting the ocean looking for you.

968
00:59:22,176 --> 00:59:24,178
My father? Really?

969
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:26,096
He's travelled hundreds of miles.

970
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:29,391
- He's been battling sharks and jellyfish. - Sharks?

971
00:59:29,475 --> 00:59:32,394
- That can't be him. - Are you sure? What was his name?

972
00:59:32,478 --> 00:59:34,480
Some sort of sport fish. Tuna? Trout?

973
00:59:34,563 --> 00:59:36,148
- Marlin? - That's it.

974
00:59:36,232 --> 00:59:39,819
- The clown fish from the reef. - It's my dad! He took on a shark!

975
00:59:39,902 --> 00:59:42,905
- I heard he took on three. - Three?

976
00:59:42,988 --> 00:59:45,282
- Three sharks? - That's 4,800 teeth!

977
00:59:45,366 --> 00:59:47,535
After you were taken by Diver Dan,

978
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:49,620
your dad followed the boat like a maniac.

979
00:59:49,703 --> 00:59:50,871
Really?

980
00:59:50,955 --> 00:59:54,542
He's giving it all he's got and then three sharks capture him.

981
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:57,419
He blows 'em up and then dives thousands of feet

982
00:59:57,503 --> 00:59:59,964
and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth!

983
01:00:00,047 --> 01:00:02,591
He ties this demon to a rock. And his reward?

984
01:00:02,675 --> 01:00:05,052
He gets to battle a jellyfish forest.

985
01:00:05,135 --> 01:00:08,264
Now he's with sea turtles on the East Australian Current

986
01:00:08,347 --> 01:00:11,809
and the word is he's headed this way, right now, to Sydney!

987
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:15,896
- What a good daddy. - He was looking for you after all.

988
01:00:19,692 --> 01:00:22,486
- He's swimming in the filter! - Not again!

989
01:00:24,738 --> 01:00:25,739
Sharkbait!

990
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:30,077
- No! - You've got your life ahead of you.

991
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,079
- We'll help you. - Get him out.

992
01:00:37,793 --> 01:00:40,421
- Get him out of there. - Come on. Grab the end.

993
01:00:41,881 --> 01:00:43,424
Are you okay?

994
01:00:43,507 --> 01:00:46,510
Can you hear me, Sharkbait? Nemo? Can you hear me?

995
01:00:46,594 --> 01:00:48,053
Yeah, I can hear you.

996
01:00:48,721 --> 01:00:50,764
Sharkbait, you did it!

997
01:00:50,848 --> 01:00:53,767
Sharkbait, you're... Covered with germs!

998
01:00:54,268 --> 01:00:55,728
That took guts.

999
01:00:56,478 --> 01:00:59,982
All right, we have less than 48 hours before Darla gets here.

1000
01:01:00,065 --> 01:01:02,109
This tank will get plenty dirty in that time,

1001
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:04,361
but we have to help it along.

1002
01:01:04,445 --> 01:01:06,906
- Jacques, no cleaning. - I shall resist.

1003
01:01:06,989 --> 01:01:09,700
Everybody else, be as gross as possible.

1004
01:01:09,783 --> 01:01:11,243
Think dirty thoughts.

1005
01:01:11,327 --> 01:01:14,914
We're going to make this tank so filthy, the dentist'll have to clean it.

1006
01:01:15,456 --> 01:01:16,832
Good work.

1007
01:01:24,673 --> 01:01:27,217
All right, we're here, dudes.

1008
01:01:27,301 --> 01:01:30,095
Get ready! Your exit's coming up, man.

1009
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:33,766
- Where? I don't see it. - Right there. I see it. I see it.

1010
01:01:34,808 --> 01:01:38,604
- You mean the swirling vortex of terror? - That's it, dude.

1011
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:42,566
- Of course it is. - First, find your exit buddy.

1012
01:01:43,692 --> 01:01:46,820
- Do you have your exit buddy? - Yes.

1013
01:01:46,904 --> 01:01:52,368
Squirt here will now give you a rundown on proper exiting technique.

1014
01:01:52,451 --> 01:01:55,537
Good afternoon. We're going to have a great jump today.

1015
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:59,750
Crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall.

1016
01:01:59,833 --> 01:02:02,753
There's a screaming bottom turn, so watch out.

1017
01:02:02,836 --> 01:02:05,589
Remember, rip it, roll it and punch it!

1018
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,259
It's like he's trying to speak to me, I know it.

1019
01:02:09,343 --> 01:02:14,056
You're really cute, but I don't know what you're saying. Say the first thing again.

1020
01:02:14,139 --> 01:02:17,101
Okay, Jellyman. Go, go, go!

1021
01:02:24,817 --> 01:02:26,694
- Whoa! - Whoa!

1022
01:02:31,115 --> 01:02:33,033
That was fun.

1023
01:02:33,575 --> 01:02:35,327
I actually enjoyed that.

1024
01:02:35,411 --> 01:02:36,870
Hey, look! Turtles.

1025
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:39,790
Most excellent.

1026
01:02:39,873 --> 01:02:45,421
Now, turn your fishy tails round and swim straight on through to Sydney.

1027
01:02:45,504 --> 01:02:47,089
No worries, man.

1028
01:02:47,172 --> 01:02:49,717
No worries. Thank you, Dude Crush.

1029
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,011
- Bye. - See you, Jellyman.

1030
01:02:52,094 --> 01:02:54,430
Tell your little dude I said hi, okay?

1031
01:02:54,513 --> 01:02:57,057
- See ya later, dudes. - Bye, everyone.

1032
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,727
Nemo would have loved this.

1033
01:03:00,561 --> 01:03:04,440
Hey, Crush. I forgot. How old are you?

1034
01:03:04,523 --> 01:03:06,525
150, dude!

1035
01:03:06,608 --> 01:03:09,319
And still young. Rock on!

1036
01:03:09,403 --> 01:03:12,698
150. I got to remember that.

1037
01:03:13,615 --> 01:03:15,075
Whoa.

1038
01:03:19,413 --> 01:03:21,957
- We going in there? - Yep.

1039
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:23,917
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1040
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:25,044
Yep.

1041
01:03:25,919 --> 01:03:28,589
We're going to just swim straight.

1042
01:03:29,882 --> 01:03:31,967
Just keep swimming

1043
01:03:32,051 --> 01:03:33,469
Dory...

1044
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:45,314
Boy, this is taking a while.

1045
01:03:45,397 --> 01:03:47,941
- Hey, how about we play a game? - Okay.

1046
01:03:48,025 --> 01:03:51,361
Okay, I'm thinking of something orange.

1047
01:03:51,445 --> 01:03:53,238
- And it's small... - It's me.

1048
01:03:53,322 --> 01:03:54,364
Right.

1049
01:03:54,448 --> 01:03:58,827
This one you'll never guess. It's orange and small.

1050
01:03:58,911 --> 01:03:59,912
It's me.

1051
01:03:59,995 --> 01:04:01,872
All righty, Mr Smarty Pants.

1052
01:04:01,955 --> 01:04:05,209
It's orange and small and white stripes...

1053
01:04:05,292 --> 01:04:07,419
Me. And the next one, just a guess, me.

1054
01:04:07,503 --> 01:04:08,712
Okay. That's just scary.

1055
01:04:08,796 --> 01:04:11,882
Wait. I've seen this floating speck before.

1056
01:04:11,965 --> 01:04:14,551
That means we've passed it.

1057
01:04:14,635 --> 01:04:16,929
That means we're not going straight.

1058
01:04:17,012 --> 01:04:19,973
We got to get to the surface. We'll figure it out there.

1059
01:04:20,057 --> 01:04:21,225
- Hey! - What?

1060
01:04:21,308 --> 01:04:23,602
Relax. Take a deep breath.

1061
01:04:27,231 --> 01:04:29,733
Now, let's ask somebody for directions.

1062
01:04:29,817 --> 01:04:32,277
Fine. Who? The speck? There's nobody here!

1063
01:04:32,361 --> 01:04:34,822
There has to be someone. It's the ocean.

1064
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:37,574
We're not the only two in here. Let's see...

1065
01:04:37,658 --> 01:04:39,451
Okay, no one there.

1066
01:04:39,535 --> 01:04:41,036
Nope.

1067
01:04:44,706 --> 01:04:47,543
- There's somebody. Hey, excu... - Dory!

1068
01:04:47,626 --> 01:04:50,087
I'm thinking of something mysterious.

1069
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:54,341
It's a fish we don't know, and if we ask it directions, it could ingest us.

1070
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:56,927
What is it with men and asking for directions?

1071
01:04:57,010 --> 01:05:00,597
Don't play the gender card. Let's play the "let's not die" card.

1072
01:05:00,681 --> 01:05:02,641
- Want to get out of here? - Of course.

1073
01:05:02,724 --> 01:05:06,770
How are we going to do that unless we give it a shot and hope for the best?

1074
01:05:06,854 --> 01:05:09,940
- You don't fully understand. - Trust me on this.

1075
01:05:19,158 --> 01:05:20,367
All right.

1076
01:05:22,578 --> 01:05:25,164
Excuse me? Little fella?

1077
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:27,583
Hello.

1078
01:05:27,666 --> 01:05:29,501
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1079
01:05:29,585 --> 01:05:31,211
Hello.

1080
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:33,630
- His son Bingo... - Nemo.

1081
01:05:33,714 --> 01:05:35,966
- ...was taken to... - Sydney.

1082
01:05:36,049 --> 01:05:37,384
Sydney, yes.

1083
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:41,263
It's really important that we get there as fast as we can.

1084
01:05:41,346 --> 01:05:43,098
Can you help us out?

1085
01:05:43,724 --> 01:05:46,727
Come on, little fella. Come on.

1086
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:49,980
Dory, I'm a little fella.

1087
01:05:50,564 --> 01:05:53,358
I don't think that's a little fella.

1088
01:05:55,861 --> 01:05:58,197
Big fella. Whale. Okay.

1089
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,407
Maybe he only speaks whale.

1090
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:04,328
We need

1091
01:06:04,411 --> 01:06:07,623
to find his son.

1092
01:06:07,706 --> 01:06:10,500
What are you doing? Are you sure you speak whale?

1093
01:06:10,584 --> 01:06:13,545
Can you give us...

1094
01:06:13,629 --> 01:06:16,673
- Heaven knows what you're saying. - ...directions?

1095
01:06:16,757 --> 01:06:20,093
- See, he's swimming away. - Come back.

1096
01:06:20,177 --> 01:06:21,803
You've offended him.

1097
01:06:21,887 --> 01:06:23,430
Maybe a different dialect.

1098
01:06:26,767 --> 01:06:29,937
This is not whale. You're speaking, like, upset stomach.

1099
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:32,731
- Maybe I should try humpback. - No, don't.

1100
01:06:34,358 --> 01:06:36,944
- You sound sick. - Maybe louder, huh?

1101
01:06:37,027 --> 01:06:38,946
- Don't do that. - Too much orca.

1102
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:43,825
- Didn't that sound a little orca-ish? - It sounds like nothing I've ever heard.

1103
01:06:46,245 --> 01:06:47,955
Just as well. He might be hungry.

1104
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:51,041
Whales don't eat clown fish. They eat krill.

1105
01:06:51,124 --> 01:06:53,752
- Swim away! - Look. Krill!

1106
01:06:56,672 --> 01:06:59,299
Move, Dory! Move!

1107
01:07:05,472 --> 01:07:08,517
Look at that. Would you look at that?

1108
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:11,895
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

1109
01:07:11,979 --> 01:07:15,399
And it's all thanks to you, kid. You made it possible.

1110
01:07:15,482 --> 01:07:17,401
Jacques, I said no cleaning.

1111
01:07:17,484 --> 01:07:18,568
I am ashamed.

1112
01:07:19,194 --> 01:07:21,113
Look. Scum angel.

1113
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:27,995
Bubbles! I love the bubbles.

1114
01:07:29,454 --> 01:07:33,458
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo? Flo!

1115
01:07:33,542 --> 01:07:35,669
9:00, and cue dentist.

1116
01:07:36,628 --> 01:07:38,338
Barbara. Sorry I'm late.

1117
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:40,632
Okay. Here we go.

1118
01:07:40,716 --> 01:07:42,384
Little Davey Reynolds.

1119
01:07:42,467 --> 01:07:46,722
- Walks to the counter, drops the keys... - Bloat, that's disgusting.

1120
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:49,141
Tastes pretty good to me.

1121
01:07:50,392 --> 01:07:53,020
Don't you realise we are swimming in our own...

1122
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,605
- Here he comes. - What the...

1123
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:58,984
Crikey. What a state.

1124
01:08:02,946 --> 01:08:06,116
Barbara, what's my earliest appointment tomorrow?

1125
01:08:06,199 --> 01:08:08,076
- 10:00, love. - Leave it open.

1126
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,663
I've got to clean the fish tank before Darla gets here.

1127
01:08:11,747 --> 01:08:16,626
- You hear that, Sharkbait? - Yay! He's going to clean the tank!

1128
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:18,587
Yeah, we're going to be clean!

1129
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:20,589
Ready to see your dad?

1130
01:08:20,672 --> 01:08:21,798
Course you are.

1131
01:08:22,257 --> 01:08:27,721
I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there in the harbour waiting for you right now.

1132
01:08:28,513 --> 01:08:29,890
Yeah.

1133
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:49,553
Here comes a big one! Come on. You got to try this.

1134
01:09:49,636 --> 01:09:53,223
- Will you just stop it? - Why? What's wrong?

1135
01:09:53,306 --> 01:09:56,101
- We're in a whale. Don't you get it? - A whale?

1136
01:09:56,184 --> 01:10:00,147
A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help. And now we're stuck here.

1137
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:04,484
- A whale? You know, I speak whale. - You're insane. You can't speak whale.

1138
01:10:04,568 --> 01:10:07,404
I have to get out. I have to find my son.

1139
01:10:08,405 --> 01:10:13,160
I have to tell him how old sea turtles are!

1140
01:10:24,171 --> 01:10:25,172
Hey.

1141
01:10:27,549 --> 01:10:29,092
You okay?

1142
01:10:35,807 --> 01:10:37,392
There, there.

1143
01:10:37,476 --> 01:10:40,103
It's all right. It'll be okay.

1144
01:10:40,187 --> 01:10:42,647
No. It won't.

1145
01:10:42,731 --> 01:10:45,025
Sure it will. You'll see.

1146
01:10:45,108 --> 01:10:49,696
No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him.

1147
01:10:52,699 --> 01:10:55,035
That's a funny thing to promise.

1148
01:10:55,118 --> 01:10:56,119
What?

1149
01:10:56,203 --> 01:10:58,705
You can't never let anything happen to him.

1150
01:10:58,788 --> 01:11:01,374
Then nothing would ever happen to him.

1151
01:11:04,002 --> 01:11:06,213
Not much fun for little Harpo.

1152
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,351
- What's going on? - Don't know. I'll ask him.

1153
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:24,814
- What's... - Dory.

1154
01:11:24,898 --> 01:11:26,358
...going

1155
01:11:26,441 --> 01:11:28,568
on?

1156
01:11:34,282 --> 01:11:37,452
- I think he says we've stopped. - Of course we've stopped.

1157
01:11:37,536 --> 01:11:41,248
Stop trying to speak whale. You're going to make things worse.

1158
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:43,083
What is that noise?

1159
01:11:46,753 --> 01:11:48,630
Oh, no. Look what you did.

1160
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:53,593
The water's going down. It's going down!

1161
01:11:57,597 --> 01:12:00,850
- Really? You sure about that? - Look. Already it's half-empty.

1162
01:12:01,935 --> 01:12:04,980
- I'd say it's half-full. - Stop that. It's half-empty!

1163
01:12:08,233 --> 01:12:10,777
Okay, that one was a little tougher.

1164
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:13,780
He either said we should go to the back of the throat

1165
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:16,032
or he wants a root beer float.

1166
01:12:16,116 --> 01:12:19,828
Of course he wants us to go there. That's eating us!

1167
01:12:19,911 --> 01:12:22,622
How do I taste, Moby? Do I taste good?

1168
01:12:22,706 --> 01:12:24,791
Tell him I'm not interested in being lunch.

1169
01:12:24,874 --> 01:12:27,294
- Okay. He's... - Stop talking to him.

1170
01:12:33,717 --> 01:12:36,761
- What is going on? - I'll check. What...

1171
01:12:36,845 --> 01:12:39,472
No. No more whale. You can't speak whale.

1172
01:12:39,556 --> 01:12:41,141
Yes, I can.

1173
01:12:41,224 --> 01:12:42,225
No, you can't.

1174
01:12:42,309 --> 01:12:45,812
You think you can do these things, but you can't, Nemo.

1175
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:52,652
- Okay. - Dory!

1176
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:59,492
He says it's time to let go.

1177
01:12:59,576 --> 01:13:01,870
Everything's going to be all right.

1178
01:13:01,953 --> 01:13:03,913
How do you know?

1179
01:13:03,997 --> 01:13:06,333
How do you know something bad isn't going to happen?

1180
01:13:07,042 --> 01:13:08,251
I don't!

1181
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:33,610
We're alive!

1182
01:13:35,362 --> 01:13:37,405
Look. Syd-ney.

1183
01:13:37,489 --> 01:13:39,449
Sydney! Sydney.

1184
01:13:39,532 --> 01:13:41,034
Sydney again.

1185
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,371
You were right. We made it!

1186
01:13:45,038 --> 01:13:47,123
We're going to find my son.

1187
01:13:50,293 --> 01:13:54,214
Thank you, sir.

1188
01:13:54,297 --> 01:13:56,341
Wow. I wish I could speak whale.

1189
01:13:56,424 --> 01:13:58,635
Now we find the boat that took him.

1190
01:13:58,718 --> 01:14:01,513
- Right. - Come on. We can do this!

1191
01:14:16,945 --> 01:14:19,823
Morning. It's morning, everyone.

1192
01:14:19,906 --> 01:14:24,577
Today's the day. The sun is shining, the tank is clean and we are getting out of...

1193
01:14:25,078 --> 01:14:26,204
The tank is clean.

1194
01:14:26,913 --> 01:14:28,623
The tank is clean!

1195
01:14:29,749 --> 01:14:30,917
But how?

1196
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,962
Boss must have installed it while we were sleeping.

1197
01:14:34,045 --> 01:14:36,548
- What are we going to do? - What's it say, Peach?

1198
01:14:37,966 --> 01:14:39,676
I can't hear you, Peach.

1199
01:14:39,759 --> 01:14:44,097
The Aqua Scum 2003 is an all-purpose, self-cleaning salt-water purifier

1200
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,766
that extends the life of your aquarium fish.

1201
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:47,934
Stop it!

1202
01:14:48,017 --> 01:14:51,896
The Aqua Scum is programmed to scan your tank every five minutes?

1203
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,690
Scan? What does that mean?

1204
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:01,781
Temperature 82 degrees, pH balance normal.

1205
01:15:03,241 --> 01:15:04,284
Nice.

1206
01:15:05,827 --> 01:15:09,038
Curse you, Aqua Scum!

1207
01:15:09,122 --> 01:15:12,459
- That's it for the escape plan. - Then what are we going to do about...

1208
01:15:13,084 --> 01:15:14,419
Darla!

1209
01:15:14,502 --> 01:15:16,296
Stay down, kid.

1210
01:15:18,631 --> 01:15:21,217
- False alarm. - My nerves can't take much more.

1211
01:15:21,468 --> 01:15:24,053
What are we going to do when that brat gets here?

1212
01:15:24,137 --> 01:15:26,806
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking. - Help!

1213
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,808
- Help me! - Hold on. I'm coming.

1214
01:15:28,933 --> 01:15:29,976
Help me!

1215
01:15:30,059 --> 01:15:32,896
Swim down! Come on, kid. Swim down!

1216
01:15:32,979 --> 01:15:35,356
- Everybody jump in. - Swim down!

1217
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,900
What the...

1218
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:38,985
Good work.

1219
01:15:39,527 --> 01:15:41,821
- Gill! - Sharkbait!

1220
01:15:43,364 --> 01:15:46,493
- Roll, kid! Lean, kid! Roll! - Go to the window.

1221
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:53,374
That would have been a nasty fall.

1222
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:56,419
- I don't want to go belly-up! - Calm down, Nemo.

1223
01:15:56,503 --> 01:15:58,755
You won't go belly-up. I promise.

1224
01:15:58,838 --> 01:15:59,839
You're going to be okay.

1225
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:05,094
Darla!

1226
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:12,727
Do any of these boats look familiar to you?

1227
01:16:12,811 --> 01:16:15,021
No, but the boat has to be here.

1228
01:16:15,104 --> 01:16:18,149
- We're going to find it. - I'm totally excited.

1229
01:16:18,233 --> 01:16:20,777
- Are you excited? - Dory, wake up. Come on.

1230
01:16:21,778 --> 01:16:22,821
Duck!

1231
01:16:23,947 --> 01:16:26,491
That's not a duck. It's a pelican!

1232
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:38,711
No! I didn't come this far to be breakfast.

1233
01:16:46,803 --> 01:16:49,222
Hey, Nigel. Would you look at that?

1234
01:16:49,305 --> 01:16:50,306
What?

1235
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:53,685
Sun's barely up and Gerald's had more than he can handle.

1236
01:16:53,768 --> 01:16:56,938
Yeah. Reckon somebody ought to help the poor guy.

1237
01:16:58,731 --> 01:17:01,526
Well, don't everybody fly off at once!

1238
01:17:04,696 --> 01:17:06,698
All right, Gerald. What is it?

1239
01:17:06,781 --> 01:17:08,575
Fish got your tongue?

1240
01:17:09,075 --> 01:17:10,535
Love a duck!

1241
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:12,287
I've got to find my son Nemo.

1242
01:17:12,996 --> 01:17:14,038
Nemo?

1243
01:17:14,122 --> 01:17:18,042
He's that fish that's been fighting the whole ocean.

1244
01:17:18,126 --> 01:17:20,461
Hey, I know where your son...

1245
01:17:21,754 --> 01:17:23,840
Wait. Come back.

1246
01:17:23,923 --> 01:17:26,426
- Stop! - Keep going. He's crazy.

1247
01:17:26,509 --> 01:17:28,803
I've got something to tell you.

1248
01:17:32,765 --> 01:17:33,808
Mine.

1249
01:17:38,396 --> 01:17:42,108
Okay. Don't make any sudden moves.

1250
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:45,737
Hop inside my mouth if you want to live.

1251
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:49,949
Hop into your mouth? And how does that make me live?

1252
01:17:50,033 --> 01:17:54,203
- Mine? - Because I can take you to your son.

1253
01:17:54,287 --> 01:17:55,622
Yeah, right!

1254
01:17:55,705 --> 01:18:00,084
No. I know your son. He's orange. He's got a gimpy fin on one side.

1255
01:18:00,168 --> 01:18:02,462
- That's Nemo! - Mine! Mine! Mine!

1256
01:18:05,298 --> 01:18:07,550
Fasten your seat belts!

1257
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:10,845
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1258
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:31,491
Everybody hold on!

1259
01:18:35,161 --> 01:18:37,372
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1260
01:18:44,253 --> 01:18:46,089
Too loud. Too loud for me.

1261
01:18:46,172 --> 01:18:48,383
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

1262
01:18:48,466 --> 01:18:51,219
Find a happy place. Find a happy place!

1263
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:54,514
Darla, your uncle will see you now.

1264
01:18:56,349 --> 01:18:59,185
All right. Let's see those pearly whites.

1265
01:18:59,727 --> 01:19:01,270
I'm a piranha.

1266
01:19:01,354 --> 01:19:02,939
They're in the Amazon.

1267
01:19:03,022 --> 01:19:06,526
And a piranha's a fish. Just like your present.

1268
01:19:08,361 --> 01:19:09,946
- I got a fishy! - Oh, no.

1269
01:19:11,197 --> 01:19:12,490
Poor little guy.

1270
01:19:12,573 --> 01:19:14,409
- He's dead. - Sharkbait!

1271
01:19:14,492 --> 01:19:16,160
Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!

1272
01:19:16,244 --> 01:19:20,081
Must have left your present in the car, sweetie. I'll go and get it.

1273
01:19:20,164 --> 01:19:21,666
He's still alive!

1274
01:19:21,749 --> 01:19:23,418
Why is he playing dead?

1275
01:19:23,501 --> 01:19:25,253
He's going to get flushed down the toilet.

1276
01:19:25,336 --> 01:19:27,797
He's going to get out of here.

1277
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:31,801
- What a smart little guy. - No, not the trash can!

1278
01:19:33,052 --> 01:19:35,096
Hey! I found his dad.

1279
01:19:35,179 --> 01:19:36,764
- Where's Nemo? - Dentist!

1280
01:19:36,848 --> 01:19:38,558
- He's over there. - What's a dentist?

1281
01:19:39,851 --> 01:19:42,228
- Get in there. - I can't go in there.

1282
01:19:42,311 --> 01:19:45,732
Oh, yes you can. Charge!

1283
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:48,568
What the...

1284
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:52,530
Darla, sweetie, look out.

1285
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:59,162
Hold still. Easy, easy.

1286
01:20:00,705 --> 01:20:02,040
Hold still!

1287
01:20:02,123 --> 01:20:03,916
It's all right. Nobody's going to hurt you.

1288
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,010
Nemo.

1289
01:20:14,093 --> 01:20:16,095
- Oh, my goodness. - Gotcha!

1290
01:20:17,472 --> 01:20:19,640
- Nemo! - Daddy?

1291
01:20:20,475 --> 01:20:23,102
Out with you. And stay out!

1292
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:26,439
- Daddy? - Fishy?

1293
01:20:27,273 --> 01:20:28,357
Fishy!

1294
01:20:28,441 --> 01:20:30,151
Wake up! Wake up!

1295
01:20:30,234 --> 01:20:31,694
- Oh, no! - To the top

1296
01:20:31,778 --> 01:20:33,362
of Mount Wannahockaloogie.

1297
01:20:33,446 --> 01:20:35,740
Why are you sleeping?

1298
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:38,201
- Hurry! - Bloat!

1299
01:20:41,412 --> 01:20:43,289
Ring of Fire!

1300
01:20:45,291 --> 01:20:46,626
Fishy!

1301
01:20:48,878 --> 01:20:50,546
- Get it out! - Crikey!

1302
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:52,298
The animals have gone mad!

1303
01:20:54,675 --> 01:20:56,385
Get it out!

1304
01:20:56,469 --> 01:20:58,429
- Smack her in the head! - Go, Gill, go!

1305
01:20:58,513 --> 01:21:00,473
There's a fish in my hair!

1306
01:21:01,307 --> 01:21:03,309
- Gill. - Sharkbait.

1307
01:21:03,392 --> 01:21:06,270
Tell your dad I said hi.

1308
01:21:11,651 --> 01:21:13,069
Go get him.

1309
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:19,450
He did it!

1310
01:21:20,326 --> 01:21:22,411
- I'm happy. - Is he going to be okay?

1311
01:21:22,495 --> 01:21:25,289
Don't worry. All drains lead to the ocean.

1312
01:21:25,373 --> 01:21:26,833
Fishy!

1313
01:21:34,799 --> 01:21:36,342
Daddy!

1314
01:22:12,712 --> 01:22:14,755
I'm... I'm so sorry.

1315
01:22:16,465 --> 01:22:18,009
Truly I am.

1316
01:22:36,152 --> 01:22:37,653
- Hey... - Dory.

1317
01:22:38,905 --> 01:22:42,742
If it wasn't for you, I never would have even made it here.

1318
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:45,119
So thank you.

1319
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:48,831
Hey, wait a minute.

1320
01:22:49,248 --> 01:22:51,667
Wait. Where are you going?

1321
01:22:51,751 --> 01:22:54,629
It's over, Dory. We were too late.

1322
01:22:56,255 --> 01:22:58,132
Nemo's gone.

1323
01:22:58,216 --> 01:23:00,134
I'm going home now.

1324
01:23:00,218 --> 01:23:02,303
No. No, you can't.

1325
01:23:04,263 --> 01:23:05,431
Stop!

1326
01:23:08,392 --> 01:23:10,645
Please don't go away. Please?

1327
01:23:12,063 --> 01:23:14,106
No one's ever stuck with me for so long before.

1328
01:23:14,774 --> 01:23:17,026
And if you leave...

1329
01:23:17,818 --> 01:23:20,613
I remember things better with you. Look.

1330
01:23:20,696 --> 01:23:22,949
P. Sherman, 42...

1331
01:23:23,991 --> 01:23:25,701
42...

1332
01:23:26,869 --> 01:23:29,413
I remember it. It's there. I know it is.

1333
01:23:29,497 --> 01:23:32,083
Because when I look at you, I can feel it.

1334
01:23:32,166 --> 01:23:34,502
And I look at you and I...

1335
01:23:36,128 --> 01:23:37,588
I'm home.

1336
01:23:40,258 --> 01:23:43,469
Please. I don't want that to go away.

1337
01:23:44,553 --> 01:23:46,472
I don't want to forget.

1338
01:23:48,015 --> 01:23:50,059
I'm sorry, Dory,

1339
01:23:50,142 --> 01:23:51,644
but I do.

1340
01:24:03,531 --> 01:24:06,867
- Manna from heaven. - Sweet nectar of life.

1341
01:24:07,493 --> 01:24:09,120
Hey!

1342
01:24:09,203 --> 01:24:12,164
- This is our spot. - Go on. Get out of here.

1343
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:16,002
Hey, hey, hey.

1344
01:24:16,085 --> 01:24:17,753
Yeah, that's it.

1345
01:24:18,921 --> 01:24:20,673
Too right, mate!

1346
01:24:20,756 --> 01:24:22,383
I got a live one here!

1347
01:24:22,466 --> 01:24:24,927
- Have you seen my dad? - Gotcha!

1348
01:24:25,011 --> 01:24:27,596
- Come back here. - You let him go!

1349
01:24:29,724 --> 01:24:31,350
Dad!

1350
01:24:32,184 --> 01:24:33,769
Dad!

1351
01:24:34,729 --> 01:24:36,022
Dad!

1352
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:37,440
No!

1353
01:24:50,369 --> 01:24:52,496
- Excuse me. - No.

1354
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:54,999
- Are you all right? - I don't know where I am.

1355
01:24:55,082 --> 01:24:57,501
I don't know what's going on. I think I lost somebody,

1356
01:24:57,585 --> 01:24:59,295
but I can't remember.

1357
01:24:59,378 --> 01:25:01,797
- It's okay. - I can't remember.

1358
01:25:01,881 --> 01:25:05,509
I'm looking for someone, too. We can look together.

1359
01:25:07,053 --> 01:25:09,013
- I'm Dory. - I'm Nemo.

1360
01:25:09,096 --> 01:25:10,556
Nemo?

1361
01:25:11,223 --> 01:25:12,475
That's a nice name.

1362
01:25:21,776 --> 01:25:23,611
- Dad! - Dad!

1363
01:25:23,694 --> 01:25:25,279
- Dad. - Dad.

1364
01:25:25,363 --> 01:25:26,947
Wait a minute. Is it your dad or my dad?

1365
01:25:27,031 --> 01:25:28,157
My dad.

1366
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,159
- Got it. Dad! - Where are we anyway?

1367
01:25:30,242 --> 01:25:31,452
Dad!

1368
01:25:32,286 --> 01:25:34,622
Syl... Schai...

1369
01:25:34,705 --> 01:25:36,123
Sydney.

1370
01:25:36,207 --> 01:25:38,793
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

1371
01:25:40,586 --> 01:25:42,004
- Nemo! - What?

1372
01:25:42,088 --> 01:25:43,714
It's you! Nemo!

1373
01:25:43,798 --> 01:25:45,424
Yes. I'm Nemo.

1374
01:25:45,508 --> 01:25:48,260
You're Nemo. You were dead. I saw you.

1375
01:25:48,344 --> 01:25:50,679
And then... Here you are. You're not dead.

1376
01:25:50,763 --> 01:25:53,182
And your father... Your father!

1377
01:25:53,265 --> 01:25:56,185
My father? You know my father? Where is he?

1378
01:25:56,268 --> 01:25:58,020
He went this way. Quick!

1379
01:25:59,647 --> 01:26:00,689
Hey!

1380
01:26:00,773 --> 01:26:02,775
Have you seen an orange fish swim by?

1381
01:26:02,858 --> 01:26:04,860
- It looks like him. - But bigger.

1382
01:26:04,944 --> 01:26:07,655
I saw him, but I'm not telling you where he went.

1383
01:26:07,738 --> 01:26:11,200
And there's no way you're going to make me.

1384
01:26:13,744 --> 01:26:14,912
Mine.

1385
01:26:14,995 --> 01:26:17,331
All right. I'll talk!

1386
01:26:17,415 --> 01:26:19,959
He went to the fishing grounds.

1387
01:26:24,922 --> 01:26:26,590
- Hey, look out. - Sorry.

1388
01:26:26,674 --> 01:26:28,467
I'm just trying to get home.

1389
01:26:31,804 --> 01:26:33,222
Daddy!

1390
01:26:33,305 --> 01:26:36,058
- Nemo? - Daddy!

1391
01:26:36,142 --> 01:26:37,226
Nemo?

1392
01:26:37,309 --> 01:26:39,145
- Dad! - Nemo's alive!

1393
01:26:39,228 --> 01:26:40,479
Dory?

1394
01:26:40,563 --> 01:26:42,356
- Nemo! - Daddy!

1395
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:45,818
- Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo! - Dad!

1396
01:26:45,901 --> 01:26:48,446
Nemo! Thank goodness.

1397
01:26:49,029 --> 01:26:51,365
It's all right, son. It's going to be okay.

1398
01:26:51,782 --> 01:26:54,160
Turn around! You're going the wrong way.

1399
01:26:57,663 --> 01:26:59,790
- Look out! - Move!

1400
01:27:21,187 --> 01:27:22,688
- Dory! - Come on.

1401
01:27:24,273 --> 01:27:26,442
Help! Get us out!

1402
01:27:27,193 --> 01:27:29,528
No, no, no! Dory!

1403
01:27:29,612 --> 01:27:31,780
- Dad, I know what to do. - Nemo, no!

1404
01:27:31,864 --> 01:27:34,617
We have to tell all the fish to swim down together.

1405
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,952
- Get out of there. - This will work.

1406
01:27:37,036 --> 01:27:39,330
No, I am not going to lose you again.

1407
01:27:39,413 --> 01:27:42,791
There's no time. It's the only way we can save Dory.

1408
01:27:44,335 --> 01:27:45,544
I can do this!

1409
01:27:47,338 --> 01:27:50,716
You're right. I know you can.

1410
01:27:51,091 --> 01:27:54,136
- Lucky fin. - Now, go. Hurry!

1411
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:56,514
Tell all the fish to swim down.

1412
01:27:56,931 --> 01:27:59,892
Well, you heard my son. Come on.

1413
01:28:01,727 --> 01:28:05,981
- Dory, you have to tell everybody to... - Swim down together.

1414
01:28:06,065 --> 01:28:08,275
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1415
01:28:08,359 --> 01:28:10,152
Swim down!

1416
01:28:14,573 --> 01:28:18,327
- Everybody swim down. - Come on. You have to swim down.

1417
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:21,080
Down! Swim down!

1418
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:26,794
Swim down! Swim down!

1419
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:36,971
Don't give up! Keep swimming!

1420
01:28:38,097 --> 01:28:39,932
Just keep swimming!

1421
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:45,271
That's it!

1422
01:28:48,857 --> 01:28:50,192
It's working!

1423
01:28:53,028 --> 01:28:56,156
Keep swimming!

1424
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,784
Just keep swimming!

1425
01:28:58,867 --> 01:29:01,078
- Come on, Dad! - You're doing great, son.

1426
01:29:01,161 --> 01:29:03,497
- That's my dad. - Let's get to the bottom.

1427
01:29:04,623 --> 01:29:06,792
Just keep swimming

1428
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:09,003
Almost there. Keep swimming!

1429
01:29:12,631 --> 01:29:13,882
Keep swimming!

1430
01:29:16,302 --> 01:29:17,344
Keep swimming!

1431
01:29:28,814 --> 01:29:29,898
Hey!

1432
01:29:29,982 --> 01:29:31,483
Where's Nemo?

1433
01:29:31,859 --> 01:29:32,943
There!

1434
01:29:35,613 --> 01:29:37,489
Oh, no. Nemo!

1435
01:29:44,496 --> 01:29:45,664
Nemo?

1436
01:29:47,374 --> 01:29:48,417
Nemo?

1437
01:29:50,169 --> 01:29:53,172
It's okay. Daddy's here. Daddy's got you.

1438
01:29:58,469 --> 01:30:00,846
- Daddy? - Oh, thank goodness.

1439
01:30:00,929 --> 01:30:02,681
Daddy...

1440
01:30:02,765 --> 01:30:05,517
- I don't hate you. - Oh, no, no, no.

1441
01:30:06,644 --> 01:30:09,021
I'm so sorry, Nemo.

1442
01:30:18,572 --> 01:30:20,783
Hey, guess what?

1443
01:30:20,866 --> 01:30:23,243
- What? - Sea turtles...

1444
01:30:23,327 --> 01:30:25,204
I met one.

1445
01:30:25,287 --> 01:30:29,083
And he was 150 years old.

1446
01:30:29,166 --> 01:30:31,126
150?

1447
01:30:31,210 --> 01:30:32,711
Yep.

1448
01:30:33,379 --> 01:30:37,466
'Cause Sandy Plankton said they only lived to be 100.

1449
01:30:38,425 --> 01:30:39,885
Sandy Plankton?

1450
01:30:39,968 --> 01:30:43,806
Think I would cross the ocean and not know as much as Sandy Plankton?

1451
01:30:43,889 --> 01:30:46,642
He was 150! Not 100.

1452
01:30:46,725 --> 01:30:50,062
Who is this Sandy Plankton that knows everything wrong?

1453
01:30:52,398 --> 01:30:55,734
Time for school! Time for school! Get up! Let's go!

1454
01:30:56,694 --> 01:30:59,530
- I'm going to win. - No, you're not.

1455
01:30:59,613 --> 01:31:03,158
- I did it. - My own son beats me.

1456
01:31:03,242 --> 01:31:05,285
Climb aboard, explorers.

1457
01:31:05,369 --> 01:31:08,664
So then the sea cucumber looks over at the mollusk and says,

1458
01:31:08,747 --> 01:31:11,250
"With fronds like these, who needs anemones?"

1459
01:31:13,502 --> 01:31:15,295
Well, hello, Nemo. Who's this?

1460
01:31:15,379 --> 01:31:18,716
- Exchange student. - I'm from the EAC, dude.

1461
01:31:18,799 --> 01:31:21,093
- Sweet. - Totally.

1462
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:25,723
Seriously, Marty, did you really do all the things you say you did?

1463
01:31:25,806 --> 01:31:27,099
Pardon me.

1464
01:31:27,975 --> 01:31:29,059
Hello.

1465
01:31:30,602 --> 01:31:32,146
Don't be alarmed.

1466
01:31:32,229 --> 01:31:35,357
We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely.

1467
01:31:35,441 --> 01:31:37,526
- Thanks. - We'll see you next week.

1468
01:31:37,609 --> 01:31:41,155
- Keep up with the programme, Dory. - Remember, fish are friends.

1469
01:31:41,238 --> 01:31:43,574
Not food! Bye!

1470
01:31:43,657 --> 01:31:45,534
Hold on. Here we go.

1471
01:31:45,617 --> 01:31:47,327
Next stop, knowledge.

1472
01:31:47,411 --> 01:31:49,872
Bye, son. Have fun.

1473
01:31:49,955 --> 01:31:51,081
Bye, Dad.

1474
01:31:52,124 --> 01:31:54,460
Mr Ray, wait. I forgot something.

1475
01:31:59,631 --> 01:32:01,300
Love you, Dad.

1476
01:32:02,509 --> 01:32:04,511
I love you, too, son.

1477
01:32:07,306 --> 01:32:09,725
Dad? You can let go now.

1478
01:32:09,808 --> 01:32:11,143
Sorry.

1479
01:32:11,226 --> 01:32:13,353
Now go have an adventure.

1480
01:32:13,437 --> 01:32:15,731
Goodbye. See you later, dudes!

1481
01:32:15,814 --> 01:32:17,566
- Bye, Elmo. - Nemo.

1482
01:32:17,649 --> 01:32:21,153
- Nemo. Bye, Nemo. - See you after school, Dory.

1483
01:32:22,029 --> 01:32:23,322
Bye, Dad!

1484
01:32:24,823 --> 01:32:26,325
Bye, son.

1485
01:32:44,259 --> 01:32:45,427
Barbara.

1486
01:32:45,511 --> 01:32:46,970
I don't understand it.

1487
01:32:47,054 --> 01:32:50,349
Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee and it breaks.

1488
01:32:50,432 --> 01:32:55,020
Had to clean the tank myself, take the fish out, put 'em in bags and...

1489
01:32:55,521 --> 01:32:57,356
Where'd the fish go?

1490
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:05,113
Come on, Peach!

1491
01:33:05,197 --> 01:33:07,658
You got it. That's it. You can do it.

1492
01:33:07,741 --> 01:33:09,993
That's the shortest red light I've ever seen.

1493
01:33:10,077 --> 01:33:11,829
Come on, Peach.

1494
01:33:21,713 --> 01:33:23,131
Now what?
