1
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,600
On September 3rd 1973 at 6:28pm and 32 seconds,

2
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,640
a bluebottle fly capable of 14,670 wing beats a minute

3
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,000
landed on Rue St Vincent, Montmartre.

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,400
At the same moment, on a restaurant terrace nearby,

5
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,120
the wind magically made two glasses dance unseen on a tablecloth.

6
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,720
Meanwhile, in a 5th-floor flat, 28 Avenue Trudaine, Paris 9,

7
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,360
returning from his best friend's funeral, Eugène Colère erased his name

8
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
from his address book.

9
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,520
At the same moment, a sperm with one X chromosome,

10
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,880
belonging to Raphaël Poulain,

11
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,800
made a dash for an egg in his wife Amandine.

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Nine months later,

13
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,320
Amélie Poulain was born.

14
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,360
Her father, an ex-army doctor,

15
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,760
works at a spa in Enghien-Les-Bains.

16
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,600
Raphaël Poulain dislikes:

17
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,440
Peeing next to someone else. He also dislikes:

18
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,080
Catching scornful glances at his sandals.

19
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,440
Clingy wet swimming trunks.

20
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Raphaël Poulain likes:

21
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,160
Peeling off large strips of wallpaper.

22
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,520
Lining up all his shoes and polishing them.

23
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,640
Emptying his tool box,

24
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,440
cleaning it out,

25
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,400
and putting everything back.

26
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,400
Amélie's mother, Amandine, a schoolmistress from Gueugnon,

27
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,440
has always had shaky nerves.

28
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,640
Amandine Poulain dislikes: Getting puckered fingers in the bath.

29
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,600
When someone she doesn't like

30
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,280
brushes against her hand.

31
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,000
Pillow marks on her cheek in the morning.

32
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,360
Amandine Poulain likes: Figure skaters' costumes on TV.

33
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,480
Polishing the parquet with slippers.

34
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,120
Emptying her handbag,

35
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,880
cleaning it out,

36
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,240
and putting everything back.

37
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,360
Amélie is six.

38
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,680
Like all little girls, she'd like to be hugged by her daddy.

39
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,560
But he never touches her, except for a monthly checkup.

40
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,200
The thrill of this rare contact

41
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,440
makes her heart beat like a drum.

42
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,960
As a result,

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
he thinks she has a heart defect.

44
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,400
Declared unfit for school,

45
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,440
Amélie is taught by her mother.

46
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,720
Four...

47
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,840
hens...

48
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
brood...

49
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,360
here...

50
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,560
henceforth.

51
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,640
Four hens brood...

52
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,200
Very good.

53
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,720
...hens fourth! - No!

54
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,320
Deprived of playmates,

55
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,880
tossed about between a neurotic and an iceberg,

56
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,960
Amélie retreats into her imagination.

57
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,080
In this world, LPs are made like pancakes.

58
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,840
The neighbor’s comatose wife

59
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,320
has chosen to get all her life's sleep in one go.

60
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,560
After this, I can stay awake day and night.

61
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,440
Amélie has one friend, Blubber.

62
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,040
Alas, the home environment has made Blubber suicidal.

63
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,240
Blubber's suicide attempts destroy Mother's nerves.

64
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,840
A decision is made.

65
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,200
Enough!

66
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,320
To comfort Amélie, her mother gives her a second-hand Instamatic camera.

67
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,000
Little girl! Look what you did!

68
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,000
A neighbor fools her into thinking her camera causes accidents.

69
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,520
Because she'd been taking pictures all afternoon, Amélie is petrified.

70
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,400
She stares at the TV, racked by the guilt

71
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,480
of causing a huge fire,

72
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,360
two derailments

73
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,200
and a jumbo jet crash.

74
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,080
A few days later,

75
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,880
realizing she'd been had,

76
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Amélie gets her revenge.

77
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,080
What...?

78
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
One day tragedy strikes.

79
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,960
Amandine takes Amélie to Notre Dame to light a candle and pray for a baby brother.

80
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,280
Three minutes later, heaven sends,

81
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,280
alas, not a baby boy, but Marguerite, a tourist from Quebec,

82
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,320
bent on ending her life.

83
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,680
Amandine Poulain is killed instantly.

84
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,640
After her mother's death, Amélie lives alone with her father.

85
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,560
His unsociable tendencies increase.

86
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,920
He's obsessed with building a miniature shrine

87
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,080
to house his wife's ashes.

88
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,360
Days, months and years go by.

89
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
In such a dead world,

90
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,600
Amélie prefers to dream until she's old enough to leave home.

91
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,720
Five years later, she's a waitress in Montmartre

92
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,840
at The Two Windmills.

93
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
It is August 29th.

94
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,280
In 48 hours, her life will change forever.

95
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,760
But she doesn't know it yet.

96
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,280
She lives quietly among her colleagues and the café's regulars.

97
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,720
That's Suzanne, the owner.

98
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,480
She limps a little but she's never spilt a drink.

99
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,520
When she was younger, she was a circus rider.

100
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,040
She likes athletes who cry with disappointment.

101
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,880
She dislikes seeing men humiliated in front of their kids in her café.

102
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,720
Georgette is the tobacconist. She's a hypochondriac.

103
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,280
Migraines one day, sciatica the next. She hates the words

104
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,440
"fruit of thy womb".

105
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Gina works with Amélie. Her grandmother was a healer.

106
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,400
She likes cracking bones.

107
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,720
She's bringing a kir to Hipolito, a failed writer.

108
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,160
He likes seeing bullfighters gored on TV.

109
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,440
Scowling at them is Joseph, Gina's rejected lover.

110
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,960
He's always jealously spying on her.

111
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,680
All he likes

112
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,560
is popping bubble wrap.

113
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,960
And here's Philomène, an air hostess.

114
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,840
Amélie looks after her cat Rodrigue when she's away. Philomène likes

115
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,680
the sound of the cat's bowl on the tiles.

116
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,520
Rodrigue likes overhearing children's stories.

117
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,200
No, thanks, ma'am. I never work on Sundays.

118
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,720
At weekends, Amélie often takes a train from the Gare du Nord to see her father.

119
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,560
- Why don't you use your retirement to...? - To do what?

120
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Travel. You've never been away.

121
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,960
When we were young, your mother and I longed to travel.

122
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
But we couldn't.

123
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,280
- Because of your heart. - Yes. I know.

124
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,600
So now...

125
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,400
Now...

126
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,160
Some Friday evenings, Amélie goes to the cinema.

127
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,720
I like turning round and looking at people's faces in the dark.

128
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,680
I like noticing details that no-one else ever sees.

129
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,040
But I hate it in old American movies when drivers don't watch the road.

130
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,560
Amélie doesn't have a boyfriend.

131
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,800
She tried once or twice, but the results were a let-down.

132
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,520
Instead, she cultivates a taste for small pleasures.

133
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,920
Plunging her hand deep into a sack of grain.

134
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,640
Cracking crème brûlée

135
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,600
with a teaspoon.

136
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,960
And skimming stones on the Canal St Martin.

137
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,040
They call him the Glass Man.

138
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,720
He was born with bones as brittle as crystal.

139
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,040
All his furniture is padded.

140
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,320
A handshake would be enough to crush his fingers.

141
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,400
He's stayed indoors for 20 years.

142
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,360
Time has changed nothing.

143
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,640
Amélie still takes refuge in solitude.

144
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,160
She amuses herself with silly questions about the world below,

145
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,040
such as: "How many couples are having an orgasm now?"

146
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,040
Fifteen.

147
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,760
Finally, on the night of August 30th 1997.

148
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,240
comes the event that will change her life forever.

149
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,760
Lady Di, Princess of Wales, died in a car crash in Paris last night

150
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,560
with her companion Dodi Al Fayed...

151
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,840
Only the first man to discover Tutankhamen's tomb

152
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
would understand how she felt

153
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,080
on finding this treasure

154
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,840
hidden by a little boy 40 years ago.

155
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,560
On August 31st at 4am,

156
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,560
Amélie has a dazzling idea.

157
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,000
Wherever he was, she would find the box's owner

158
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,240
and give him back his treasure.

159
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,880
If he was touched, she'd become a regular do-gooder.

160
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,840
If not, too bad.

161
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,160
The girl from the 5th floor! We don't see much of you.

162
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,320
Would you know of a boy who lived in my flat in the '50s?

163
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,520
A boy? Come and have a glass of port.

164
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,920
- No, thanks. - Come in! Close the door.

165
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,920
Boys? I've known so many.

166
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,080
They're cute until they discover snowballs and chestnuts.

167
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
I've known so many boys.

168
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,560
- When did you come here? - In '64.

169
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,240
You'll have heard the story.

170
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,400
No, I don't think so.

171
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,200
I'm amazed. Sit down.

172
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,720
My husband worked for Ladybird Insurance.

173
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,080
It's no secret that he slept with his secretary.

174
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,920
They used every hotel around.

175
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,600
Not the grotty ones, either.

176
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,840
The bimbo liked spreading her legs,

177
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,320
but only on satin.

178
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,240
So my husband swiped from the till.

179
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,200
A little at first, then 50 million.

180
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,400
Off they flew to South America.

181
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Drink up.

182
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,440
On January 20th 1970,

183
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,800
my doorbell rang.

184
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,720
"Your husband's been killed in a car crash in South America."

185
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,760
My life stopped there.

186
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,840
And Black Lion died of heartbreak.

187
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,600
Poor creature.

188
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
See how lovingly

189
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,040
he still stares at his master?

190
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
One day

191
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,520
I'll read you his letters.

192
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,240
No, don't go!

193
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,640
You can spare five minutes.

194
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,280
He wrote this

195
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,920
from the barracks.

196
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,840
"Darling Mado." That's me.

197
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,480
I'm called Madeleine.

198
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,400
"I can't sleep, can't eat,

199
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,040
knowing that my only reason to live is far away in Paris.

200
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,400
I won't see her until a fortnight on Friday,

201
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:18,000
when my sweet little weasel appears at the station

202
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,000
in her strappy blue dress."

203
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,920
In brackets: "The one you think is too transparent."

204
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,360
Has anyone ever written to you like that?

205
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,320
No. I'm nobody's little weasel.

206
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,840
My name's Madeleine Wells.

207
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,840
Madeleine, like Mary Magdalene.

208
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,240
She wept, right? And Wells as in water.

209
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,320
Talk about being born to cry!

210
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,520
About your question...

211
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,800
Ask Collignon, the grocer. He's lived here all his life.

212
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,120
Hello, Amélie-mellow!

213
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,600
A fig and three hazelnuts, as usual?

214
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,320
Who lived in my flat in the '50s?

215
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,200
- What was their name? - You've got me there, dear.

216
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,040
In 1950, I was two. The mental age of this cretin.

217
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,640
The "cretin" is Lucien.

218
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,560
He's no genius, but Amélie likes him. She likes the way

219
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,800
he handles each endive like a precious object

220
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,920
to be treated with care. It's his way of showing

221
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,320
his love of good work.

222
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
Look at him!

223
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,680
Like he's nursing a baby bird that's fallen out of its nest!

224
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,280
Don't ask him for currants!

225
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,880
You'd be here till Monday!

226
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,960
Get moving, spastic!

227
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,960
She hasn't got all day.

228
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,800
Here.

229
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,400
Go and see my mother. She has the memory of an elephant.

230
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,520
Elephant Mum!

231
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,200
Thank you.

232
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,120
Bredoteau.

233
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,640
Sorry?

234
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,400
It's the name you're after.

235
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,680
But if it's me that says so, it won't count. I'm senile.

236
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,600
Ignore him. He's senile.

237
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
See what he's done to my laurel?

238
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,120
His old job was punching métro tickets.

239
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,160
For three months now, he's got up every night to punch holes

240
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,560
- in my laurels! - I'd have preferred lilacs. Such is life!

241
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,880
- We all need a way to relax. - I skim stones.

242
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,920
- You do? - I'll find it. Don't worry.

243
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,800
- I file everything. - Like what?

244
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,440
Your son's nearly 50 and I'm still doing his book-keeping.

245
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,000
You were still squeezing his toothpaste at 15, so it follows.

246
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,320
Right. Camus...

247
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,200
2nd floor on the right. Brossard... Brossard was on staircase B.

248
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,760
Got it!

249
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,840
Bredoteau, 5th floor on the right.

250
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,520
They were from the Pas de Calais.

251
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,080
Bredoteau. What more can I say?

252
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,720
Groping under the photo booth is Nino Quincampoix.

253
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,480
When Amélie lacked playmates, Nino had too many.

254
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,040
Five miles apart, one dreamed of having a sister, the other a brother

255
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,040
to spend all their time with.

256
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
Hi, Dad.

257
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,680
A new friend?

258
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,800
No, I've had him for years.

259
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,600
Your mother hated him, so he lived in the tool shed.

260
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,520
There. Let's reconcile them.

261
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
There. Not bad, eh?

262
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,760
Dad, if you found a precious relic from your childhood,

263
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,520
how would it make you feel? Happy? Sad? Nostalgic? What?

264
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,960
I didn't have this gnome when I was a child.

265
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,480
He was a retirement gift from my old regiment.

266
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,800
No, I mean something you hid like a secret treasure.

267
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,280
I should varnish him before autumn.

268
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,560
I'll make some tea. Do you want some?

269
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Breathe in. Hold still.

270
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,240
Better now?

271
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,080
Shut the door!

272
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,080
There's a howling gale.

273
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,040
It's hardly Siberia.

274
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,560
I can see you're not allergic

275
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,080
to car fumes. I almost coughed up my pleura last night.

276
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,560
Coughed up a pleura? Sure.

277
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,040
- What's on the menu today, Suzanne? - Endives au gratin.

278
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,440
They'll have you on your knees, you'll see.

279
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,640
They're good, then?

280
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,800
- Depends where. - If it's at the toilet...

281
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,080
Not good!

282
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,200
12:15, laughs orgasmically to attract alpha male.

283
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,040
He's going to drive me berserk!

284
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,680
Can't he give up? There are plenty of other bars.

285
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,600
Goodbye.

286
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,840
Suzanne.

287
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,720
- Suzanne. - Yes.

288
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,400
"Au gratin" means white sauce, right?

289
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,000
Yes, why?

290
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,880
I can't stomach it. Like you and horse meat.

291
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,560
It's not my stomach, it's my memory.

292
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,280
I'd rather cook human flesh.

293
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,280
You're kidding!

294
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,160
Suzanne, would you mind if I left early today?

295
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,160
What's his name?

296
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Dominique Bredoteau.

297
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,280
Hello.

298
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,200
Are you Dominique Bredoteau?

299
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,560
That's me.

300
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,520
Why?

301
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
It's about...

302
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,760
...the petition.

303
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,160
Petition?

304
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,760
Yes. The petition to...

305
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,960
...to canonize Lady Di.

306
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,600
No, thanks.

307
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
No.

308
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,600
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to bother you...

309
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,440
- Yes? - Hello.

310
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm looking for Dominique Bredoteau for the European census.

311
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,080
Come up. Third floor.

312
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Hello, kitten.

313
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,400
Earl Grey?

314
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
Jasmine?

315
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,400
What will you have?

316
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,520
I'm working.

317
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,720
There. I'm coming.

318
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,960
Do you know where I can find Dominique Bredoteau?

319
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,200
Oh, my poor dear!

320
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,360
You just missed him.

321
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,040
Look, there he goes now.

322
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,080
Bre-to-deau.

323
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,880
Not Bre-do-teau.

324
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,720
You need

325
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,120
a glass of mulled wine.

326
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,920
Come in.

327
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,160
Come on in.

328
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,520
I've lived here for five years. This is the first time we've met.

329
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,200
I never go out on the landing.

330
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,080
I'm fussy about who I meet.

331
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,640
They're all creeps anyway.

332
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,240
Come in. Here.

333
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,640
Come in.

334
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,080
They call me the Glass Man,

335
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,560
but my name is Raymond Dufayel.

336
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,800
- Amélie Poulain. I'm a waitress at... - The Two Windmills. I know.

337
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,680
And you've come back empty-handed from your search for Bretodeau.

338
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,280
Because it's not "do", it's "to".

339
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,720
- Like "Toto". - Thank you.

340
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,040
I love that painting.

341
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,640
It's the Luncheon Of The Boating Party.

342
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,280
By Renoir.

343
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,680
I've painted one each year for twenty years.

344
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,880
The hardest part is the looks.

345
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,760
I sometimes feel they deliberately change their mood as soon as my back's turned.

346
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,360
They look quite happy there.

347
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,640
They should be.

348
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,640
This year they had hare with morels.

349
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,280
And waffles with jam for the children.

350
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,640
Now, what have I done with that piece of paper?

351
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,840
Ah, you've noticed my video camera at the window.

352
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,440
It's a gift from my sister-in-law.

353
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,200
I put it there

354
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,080
so I don't need to wind up my clocks.

355
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,960
After all these years,

356
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,160
the only person I still can't capture

357
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,400
is the girl with the glass of water.

358
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,880
She's in the middle,

359
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,640
yet she's on the outside.

360
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,640
Maybe she's just different from the others.

361
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,400
In what way?

362
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,360
I don't know.

363
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,400
When she was little, she can't have played much with other children.

364
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,360
Maybe never.

365
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,240
Here.

366
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,040
Dominique Bretodeau, 27 Rue Mouffetard.

367
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,520
It's for you.

368
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,480
Every Tuesday morning, Dominique Bretodeau goes to buy a chicken.

369
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,560
He usually roasts it and has it with sauté potatoes.

370
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,760
After carving the legs, the breast and the wings,

371
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,680
he loves picking the hot carcass with his fingers,

372
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,320
starting with the oysters.

373
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,040
But not today. Bretodeau won't buy a chicken.

374
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,480
He'll go no further

375
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,120
than this phone booth here.

376
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,800
In a flash, it all came back to him.

377
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,920
Federico Bahamontes winning the Tour de France in '59.

378
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Aunt Josette's slips.

379
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,200
And most of all, that tragic day.

380
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,000
That tragic day when he won all the marbles at break time.

381
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
Bretodeau!

382
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,640
Bretodeau!

383
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,000
The pinch, Bretodeau!

384
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
Do you understand, Bretodeau?

385
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,760
Cognac, please.

386
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,520
It's amazing, what just happened to me.

387
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,600
It must be my guardian angel. It's the only explanation.

388
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,000
It was as if the phone booth was calling me.

389
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,360
It rang and rang.

390
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,720
Same here. The microwave's calling me.

391
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
I'll have another cognac.

392
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,600
Life's strange.

393
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,240
To a kid, time always drags. Suddenly you're 50.

394
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,320
All that's left of your childhood

395
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,520
fits in a little box,

396
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,960
a little rusty box.

397
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,680
Have you got kids, miss?

398
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,120
I have a daughter. She must be about your age.

399
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,640
We haven't spoken for years.

400
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,480
I heard she had a child, a boy.

401
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
His name is Lucas.

402
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,280
I think it's time I looked them up before I'm in a box myself.

403
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,920
Don't you think?

404
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,400
Amélie suddenly has a strange feeling of complete harmony.

405
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,160
It's a perfect moment. Soft light, a scent in the air, the quiet murmur of the city,

406
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,520
She breathes deeply. Life seems so simple and clear.

407
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:35,160
A surge of love, an urge to help mankind suddenly engulfs her.

408
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,560
Let me help you. Step down.

409
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,520
Off we go! We just passed the drum major's widow!

410
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,440
She's worn his coat since the day he died. Careful.

411
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,480
The horse's head on the butcher's has lost an ear.

412
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,920
That's the florist laughing. He has crinkly eyes.

413
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,920
In the bakery window there are lollipops!

414
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,680
Mmm. Smell that.

415
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,880
They're giving out melon slices.

416
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,840
Sugarplum ice cream!

417
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,440
We're passing the pork butcher.

418
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,800
Ham, 79 francs. Spareribs, 45!

419
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,480
Now the cheese shop. Picodons are 12.90, cabecous 23.50.

420
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,920
At the butcher's a baby's watching a dog that's watching the chickens roasting.

421
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,240
Now we're at the newspaper kiosk by the métro.

422
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
I'll leave you here. Bye.

423
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,840
"She can't relate to other people."

424
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,720
"She was always a lonely child."

425
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,400
On a sparkling evening in July,

426
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,200
while on the beaches holidaymakers

427
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,720
relax in the new-found sun,

428
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,200
and in Paris the sweltering crowds

429
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,520
gaze at the first bursts

430
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,120
of the traditional fireworks, Amélie Poulain,

431
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,760
godmother of outcasts,

432
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,200
Madonna of the unloved,

433
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,320
finally succumbs to exhaustion.

434
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,920
In Paris' grief-stricken streets,

435
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,680
a vast throng of mourners

436
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,720
line her funeral route in silence

437
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,040
with the measureless sorrow of newly orphaned children.

438
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,080
What a strange destiny for one

439
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,480
who gave her all,

440
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,960
yet took such joy in life's simple pleasures.

441
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,480
Like Don Quixote, she pitted herself

442
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,560
against the grinding windmill of all life's miseries.

443
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,480
It was a losing battle

444
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,440
that claimed her life too soon.

445
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,680
At barely 23, Amélie Poulain

446
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,200
let her young, tired body merge

447
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,520
with the ebb and flow of universal woe.

448
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:57,560
As she went, she felt a stab of regret for letting her father die

449
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,040
without trying to give his stifled life

450
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,160
the breath of air she had given

451
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
to so many others.

452
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,880
Wait!

453
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,440
Wait!

454
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Wait...

455
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
Wait, wait!

456
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,360
Pages full of dud ID photos torn up and discarded by their owners,

457
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,920
carefully reassembled by some oddball.

458
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,920
Some family album!

459
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,440
A pack of Gauloises.

460
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,400
Just a second. It's so smoky in here. Can you tell me where they are?

461
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,040
- I can't see a thing. - More to the left.

462
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,640
- There? - A bit more. There.

463
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,600
Thank you. You need change.

464
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,960
Forget it.

465
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,920
- Yes? - A mauresque.

466
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,360
A mauresque for the young man.

467
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,680
One kir aligoté, one mauresque, and two mint sodas.

468
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,880
Was that prenuptial or post-coital smooching?

469
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,920
Is your bullshit congenital?

470
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,840
- Prenuptial. - Don't worry.

471
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,880
You'll find Mr. Right one day.

472
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,120
All women want to sleep on a man's shoulder. All of them.

473
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,800
All men snore after a few drinks, and I have a musical ear.

474
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,440
I had an operation on my nasal cavities.

475
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,480
I see you're a born romantic.

476
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,880
I see you've never known true love.

477
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,600
I did. It shortened my leg.

478
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,360
- I thought you fell off a horse. - I did.

479
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,800
I was in love with a trapeze artist.

480
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,000
I should have known. They always drop you at the last minute.

481
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,640
He dropped me just before my act.

482
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,120
It floored me. And the horse.

483
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,080
With me under it.

484
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,200
The mauresque?

485
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,080
Still, true love does exist.

486
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,880
I'm not saying it doesn't. After 30 years behind this bar,

487
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,480
I'm an expert. I can even give you the recipe.

488
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,360
Take two regulars.

489
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,520
Let each think the other fancies them. Leave it to simmer.

490
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,400
It never fails.

491
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,120
Excuse me!

492
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,840
Excuse me.

493
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,640
- I've had enough. - I'll go.

494
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,120
Haven't you hurt enough people?

495
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,360
Gina can defend herself.

496
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,560
I don't mean Gina. I mean Georgette.

497
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,600
Georgette?

498
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,640
Open your eyes! She craves your attention

499
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,400
but you only have eyes for Gina.

500
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,760
Poor girl! The things she does

501
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,760
to catch your eye!

502
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,200
You really must be blind.

503
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,520
I'm off on a date. Bye!

504
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,600
Goodbye.

505
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,080
Whoever her new one is,

506
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,560
he can't be worse than that nut with his tape recorder.

507
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,560
Joseph's not so nutty.

508
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,240
He's just in pain.

509
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,160
Come off it, Amélie. They split up two months ago.

510
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,360
To keep on coming here every day, he must be a masochist.

511
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,320
Don't say you haven't noticed.

512
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,080
Noticed what?

513
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,920
He always sits here, right?

514
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,440
Yes.

515
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,800
Sit down.

516
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,000
Sit down, Georgette.

517
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,200
- What can you see? - My cigarette counter.

518
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,320
And nothing's missing?

519
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,320
No.

520
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,840
Make an effort.

521
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,360
I don't get it!

522
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,880
I'll leave you to think about it. Good night.

523
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,680
Good morning.

524
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,080
Letter Arrives 30 Years Late.

525
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:43,520
A mailbag found by climbers on a glacier on Mont Blanc was part of a cargo

526
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,000
lost in a plane crash in the late 1960s.

527
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,360
So sad! A young, pretty princess for once.

528
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,720
Would it be less sad if she were old and ugly?

529
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,880
Of course. Look at Mother Teresa.

530
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,120
Is he still chasing Gina?

531
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,320
No, he's after somebody else now.

532
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,560
- Anyone I know? - Yes.

533
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,920
Funny about this glacier.

534
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,720
Somebody at The Two Windmills?

535
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,800
Not you, surely!

536
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,000
No.

537
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,840
Not Suzanne.

538
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,760
Surely not!

539
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,440
Yes.

540
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,360
- Look. There he is again. - How strange.

541
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,640
- And here. - Him again.

542
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,200
"Gare de Lyon."

543
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And here.

544
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,640
"March 5th, Austerlitz."

545
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,440
Always the same blank expression.

546
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,920
Twelve times.

547
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,800
I counted.

548
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,120
It's very odd.

549
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:53,920
Why keep taking your picture all over town only to throw them away?

550
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,680
Good ones, too.

551
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,480
It's like a sort of ritual.

552
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,640
Maybe he's so terrified

553
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,920
of growing old, it's his only consolation.

554
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,920
He's dead.

555
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,120
Dead?

556
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,880
Yes. He's scared of being forgotten.

557
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,960
So he uses the photo booths to remind people what he looks like.

558
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,240
Like faxing his portrait from the afterlife.

559
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,120
A dead man who's scared of being forgotten.

560
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,240
At least these guys here have made it.

561
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,320
They're long dead,

562
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,120
but they'll never be forgotten.

563
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,720
- The girl with the glass... - Yes.

564
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,000
Maybe she's distracted because she's thinking about someone.

565
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,880
Somebody in the picture?

566
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,440
No.

567
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,080
More likely a boy she saw somewhere,

568
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,400
and felt an affinity with.

569
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,360
You mean, she'd rather imagine herself relating to someone who's absent

570
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,920
than build relationships with those around her?

571
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,360
No.

572
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,400
Maybe she tries hard to fix other people's messy lives.

573
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,320
What about her?

574
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,200
And her own messy life?

575
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,640
Who'll fix that?

576
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,640
It's better to help people than a garden gnome.

577
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:37,480
The driver had 2.8g of alcohol in his blood!

578
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,920
Makes me sick!

579
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,800
Talk about employing irresponsible morons!

580
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,080
Mr. Collignon.

581
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,960
- You forgot your keys... - Hold on, Amélie-mellow. Speed kills.

582
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,280
Model yourself on Lucien.

583
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,880
No radar will ever catch him while he's working, will it?

584
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,320
You shouldn't do that, Mr. Collignon.

585
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,200
It's not his fault.

586
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,920
True, Mrs. Cauchoix!

587
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,800
It's not his fault he can't sleep. It's Lady Di's.

588
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,680
Guess what I found in the truck. A lingerie catalogue.

589
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:13,000
He'd pasted Lady Di's face over the model's.

590
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,560
What today? Five asparagus,

591
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,480
or more local history?

592
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,760
Nothing.

593
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,360
Thank you.

594
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,400
The migraine seems to be better.

595
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,200
Yes, but my sciatica kept me awake all night.

596
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,000
- It's ages since I saw you looking so good. - Really?

597
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:58,960
A woman without love withers like a flower without sun.

598
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,680
Strange weather today.

599
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,320
What's so funny?

600
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,560
Everyone who's come in today has given us a weather report.

601
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,760
We pass the time of day to forget how time passes.

602
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,240
We do it to keep us from talking crap.

603
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,840
I write crap but nobody wants to publish it.

604
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,360
- Another rejection? - My thirtieth.

605
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,720
Isn't your cousin a book critic?

606
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,680
Forget it! Critics are like leeches

607
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,880
sucking the blood of writers.

608
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,280
Is your book a love story?

609
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,320
No, it's about a guy who keeps a journal.

610
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,600
Not about what's happened to him,

611
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,320
but disasters that might happen in the future.

612
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:47,480
- So he gets depressed and does nothing. - So basically, it's about a loafer.

613
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,520
Suzanne,

614
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,120
I'll dedicate the manuscript to you.

615
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,240
He's only doing it so you'll write off his tab!

616
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,280
His scribbles for my nibbles. That's sponsorship.

617
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,680
What took you so long?

618
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,120
Look at the time!

619
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,000
Somebody peed in his mother!

620
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,480
Without you, today's emotions would be the scurf of yesterday's.

621
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,080
"Without you, today's emotions would be the scurf

622
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,200
of yesterday's."

623
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,560
Sorry?

624
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,080
Without you, today's emotions would be the scurf of yesterday's.

625
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,400
Tickets, please.

626
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,880
How's work?

627
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,920
- You've already asked me that. - Yes. Yes.

628
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,920
You're keeping well?

629
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,320
Pretty much.

630
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,400
I feel a change.

631
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,120
I had two heart attacks and had to have an abortion

632
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,520
because I did crack while I was pregnant.

633
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,080
Other than that, I'm fine.

634
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,680
Good.

635
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,720
Good.

636
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,240
Is something wrong?

637
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,200
No, nothing.

638
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,520
Your garden gnome's gone.

639
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,160
Is he back in the tool shed?

640
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,520
Moscow.

641
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,560
There.

642
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,800
No explanation.

643
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,960
Maybe he just wanted to see the world.

644
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,560
I can't understand it.

645
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,560
I can't understand it.

646
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,760
Any normal girl would call the number straightaway,

647
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,880
meet him at a café to return the album.

648
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,080
Then she would know if her dream was viable.

649
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:20,360
It's called a reality check, but it's the last thing Amélie wants.

650
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,960
I say!

651
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,400
She's not falling in love, is she?

652
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,240
...and 30 makes 50. - Thanks, Lucien.

653
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,840
Yes, ladies?

654
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,240
- A pound of leeks. - Two artichokes.

655
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,120
OK.

656
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,160
- Where's the boss? - Shh! He's sleeping in the cauliflowers.

657
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,240
What?

658
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,160
He's sleeping in the cauliflowers.

659
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,560
Oh, right.

660
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,440
You want me... want what?

661
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,840
A scratch card, please.

662
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,000
How does it work?

663
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,560
Tell you what.

664
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,040
I'll take one too, and we'll do this together.

665
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,200
You scratch it here...

666
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,360
...sideways.

667
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,120
Nothing. You?

668
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,880
No, me neither.

669
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,760
Unlucky at cards...

670
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,800
So they say!

671
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,360
I have to get back.

672
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,920
OK. See you.

673
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,840
Porno Video Palace.

674
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,960
I'm calling about the ad.

675
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,120
- Are you over 18? - Yes.

676
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,360
- Shaved? - Sorry?

677
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,160
Are you shaved? Fur pie doesn't sell.

678
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,840
How's life, Mrs. Wells?

679
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,600
When you've nothing to live for...

680
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,040
- Don't say that. Life's great! - Sure. Dream on, kid!

681
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,800
Hello, Mr. Dufayel.

682
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,480
Hello, Lucien.

683
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:22,200
Here's your order, Mr. Dufayel.

684
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,120
I doubt it. I hate artichokes.

685
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,120
You shouldn't.

686
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,160
Watch this.

687
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,880
Take it.

688
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,640
That's better.

689
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,120
Lucien, you're a wizard!

690
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,640
All courtesy of Mr. Collignon.

691
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,240
Mr. Collignon? Lucien...

692
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,960
Sorry, Mr. Dufayel. It just slipped out.

693
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,080
Practice, Lucien!

694
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,800
Practice!

695
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,640
Repeat after me.

696
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,760
Collignon, down the john.

697
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,360
- Col... Collignon, down the john. - That's it.

698
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,000
Your turn now. Go on. Collignon...

699
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,360
Collignon, big moron!

700
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,000
See? You can do it when you want to!

701
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,560
Collignon, dead and gone!

702
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,720
Very good!

703
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,760
Collignon...

704
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,760
- Collignon, big moron, down the john! - That's it!

705
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,360
OK! That's enough for today.

706
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,320
Enough! Enough!

707
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,200
Lucien, stop!

708
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,920
Very good.

709
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,760
Mr. Dufayel, I found this under your mat.

710
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,600
Still no win!

711
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,640
Me neither.

712
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,560
May I?

713
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,840
There's a little...

714
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,640
You're gorgeous

715
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,320
when you blush.

716
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,600
Like a wild flower.

717
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,840
It's my dyspepsia.

718
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,440
Morning, all.

719
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,080
Beautiful day.

720
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,040
Pack of Gitanes, please.

721
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,840
Bravo! Vive la France! You scalded me.

722
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,120
Bravo! Ten out of ten! Bull's-eye!

723
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,040
It was Amélie. She...

724
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:55,480
Do you know what happened when they went up Mont Blanc?

725
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,880
The silicon in her face froze up.

726
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,240
Her face was a festering mass!

727
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:30,680
Mulled wine and ginger biscuits.

728
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,280
Thank you.

729
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,400
I was too hard the other day on the girl with the glass.

730
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,200
Tell me about that boy she saw. Did they meet again?

731
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:43,680
No.

732
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,440
They're into different things.

733
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,920
Luck is like the Tour de France.

734
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,960
You wait, and it flashes past you.

735
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,280
You have to catch it while you can.

736
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,360
Can I help you?

737
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,440
Excuse me. I found this album in the street and I...

738
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:29,880
Nino will be so pleased! He was so sad the other day.

739
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,800
I almost prayed to St Anthony.

740
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,400
Is... Nino there?

741
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,120
No. On Wednesdays he works at the funfair.

742
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,360
How long has he had this collection?

743
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,680
Since I got him the job here, last year.

744
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,760
Before, he collected footprints. He worked nights.

745
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:56,520
In the daytime he took pictures of footprints in wet cement.

746
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,640
He's a funny guy.

747
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,880
When we met, he was a Santa Claus.

748
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,600
Other things like...

749
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:09,360
Whenever he heard a funny laugh, he'd tape it.

750
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,360
Really?

751
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,640
Must be hard for his girlfriend.

752
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,920
He never keeps them long.

753
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,640
Times are hard for dreamers.

754
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,360
Eva! Where are those coffees?

755
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,760
I'd better go. Thanks for the album.

756
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:32,320
It's OK. I've got time to take it to the funfair.

757
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:36,640
Suit yourself. The ghost train. Ask for Nino Quincampoix, like the street.

758
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,960
I'm looking for Nino. Is he here?

759
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
He doesn't get off till seven.

760
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,800
- Is there no way to see him before? - Sure.

761
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,600
20 francs.

762
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,200
See you next Wednesday.

763
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,680
5pm tomorrow, Montmartre carousel near the phone box. Bring a 5 franc piece.

764
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,080
Want to know about her?

765
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,320
- You know her? You saw her? - You bet.

766
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,280
She put us in her shirt pocket.

767
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,800
Next to her breast.

768
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,680
Is she pretty?

769
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,600
Not bad.

770
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,560
- Beautiful. - No, pretty.

771
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:12,880
- Beautiful. - Pretty.

772
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,600
- What does she want from you? - She's broke.

773
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,240
She wants a reward for the album.

774
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,480
Or she collects photos, too.

775
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,680
She wants to trade us for a one-eyed man with glasses!

776
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,120
No, you dope!

777
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,880
She's in love.

778
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,600
- I don't even know her. - Yes, you do.

779
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,360
Since when?

780
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,080
You've always known her.

781
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,360
In your dreams.

782
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,280
Hello?

783
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:00,240
Yes. You! Man with the plastic bag! It's for you.

784
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,160
- Me? - Yes.

785
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,320
Thank you.

786
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,200
Hello?

787
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,920
Follow the blue arrows, Mr. Quincampoix.

788
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:39,000
When the finger's pointing to the sky, only a fool looks at the finger.

789
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,520
Hello?

790
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,800
I know the stranger in the pictures.

791
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:56,760
He's a ghost. He's invisible, Mr. Quincampoix.

792
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,040
He only appears when the film is developed.

793
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,320
When a girl has her photo taken,

794
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:09,080
he goes "Oooh!" in her ear, while he gently caresses her neck.

795
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,560
That's how he got caught, Mr. Quincampoix.

796
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,400
Who are you?

797
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,840
Page 51.

798
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,600
[DO YOU

799
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,400
WANT

800
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,800
TO MEET ME?]

801
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,520
Listen to this. "A boy of six,

802
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,640
while his parents sleep, drives off

803
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,360
in a pedal car.

804
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,960
Found on a motorway near Münster in Germany,

805
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,440
he told the police he wanted to see the stars."

806
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:23,000
Isn't life beautiful, eh?

807
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:27,440
Love. The only bug she hadn't caught!

808
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:30,400
- Nobody's immune. - At least it gives me a break.

809
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,560
Love's a great beautician.

810
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:38,000
What's she like? Tall? Small? Blonde? Dark?

811
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,320
Let's say... average height.

812
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,440
Not a dwarf or a giraffe. Normal.

813
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,920
Pretty, for her type.

814
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,200
As for blonde or dark...

815
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,680
...it's hard to say, but she wasn't a redhead.

816
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,520
- Unless... - Forget it.

817
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:04,280
I do remember she casually asked if you had a girlfriend.

818
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,320
And?

819
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,720
I said you weren't interested, right?

820
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,520
You didn't!

821
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,720
What do you care? You don't even know her.

822
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:17,760
- Exactly. It's the mystery. - You won't find mystery here.

823
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,920
A pound of nectarines, please.

824
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,680
These ones here are the prettiest.

825
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,760
Trust him. He's an artist!

826
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,760
He's been going home every night with tons of unsold stock.

827
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,840
What for? Is he stewing a pig?

828
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,960
No, sir! He's studying art!

829
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,560
He sells leeks all day long and paints turnips all night!

830
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,600
The boy's a useless vegetable.

831
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,080
A good prompter

832
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:43,560
in each cellar window whispering cutting retorts

833
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,120
would mean shy people had the last laugh.

834
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,520
At least you'll never be a vegetable.

835
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,720
Even artichokes

836
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:51,760
have hearts.

837
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,120
You'll never be a vegetable. Even artichokes have hearts!

838
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,360
Memory seven.

839
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:00,440
Darling Mado, I miss you more and more each day.

840
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,640
I'm an exile in a world of dreary khaki.

841
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,880
I can't sleep, can't eat...

842
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,520
This camp was the biggest mistake of my life,

843
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,200
depriving me of my beloved for five long weeks.

844
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:15,000
I think of you endlessly. Your Adrien.

845
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:21,280
I turned down my last month's wages instead of giving notice.

846
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,480
I dream of better times ahead.

847
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,360
An orange-colored day. Remember, my love?

848
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,400
Your ever-loving Adrien.

849
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,480
Good news, darling Mado.

850
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:37,720
Soon I'll be able to afford a car

851
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,160
and drive home every night.

852
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:44,440
Till then, meet me on Friday and we'll go out.

853
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,400
Psychiatric Helpline.

854
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,880
Hello? Hello?

855
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,480
One hour later at 11 Boulevard St Martin,

856
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:20,000
Amélie walks into a party goods and costume shop.

857
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,280
At the same time, a man leaves his home at 108 Rue Lecourbe.

858
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:30,760
26 minutes later, Amélie is at the photo booth at the Gare de l'Est.

859
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:38,760
Simultaneously, the man in red shoes parks outside.

860
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,040
The time is exactly 11:40.

861
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,760
At this precise moment,

862
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:32,400
only Amélie has the key to the riddle of the mystery man.

863
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,720
How's it going, Mrs. Wells?

864
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,520
It's always better when it's not raining.

865
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,880
- This is for you. - Me?

866
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,960
Dear Mrs. Wells, We recently recovered a mailbag

867
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,000
that was lost in a plane crash

868
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:02,560
on October 12th 1969 on Mont Blanc.

869
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:06,880
We are forwarding the enclosed letter to your address.

870
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,920
Please accept our apologies for the uncustomary delay.

871
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,560
Jacques Grosjean, Customer Services.

872
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:19,000
Darling Mado, I'm in exile. I can't sleep, can't eat.

873
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,680
I think of you endlessly.

874
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:24,440
I know I've made the biggest mistake of my life.

875
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:27,080
I turned down that woman's money.

876
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:31,880
If all goes well, I'll soon be able to afford a house.

877
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,840
I dream of better times ahead

878
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:38,600
when you'll forgive me and join me here

879
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,880
one orange-colored day. Your ever-loving Adrien.

880
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,560
Mr. Dufayel, another package for you.

881
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,080
Mr. Dufayel, do you know what happened to the concierge?

882
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:27,760
She got a letter.

883
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:31,480
From her husband. 40 years late.

884
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,680
That's a lot, isn't it, Mr. Dufayel?

885
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,680
I'm not big on still life, Mr. Dufayel.

886
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,640
Then work on your thin layer.

887
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,320
Fat over thin. Always!

888
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:17,120
- Mr. Dufayel... - Yes!

889
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:21,360
The papers said that there'll soon be a new star.

890
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:28,240
- So you're into stars now? - I saw it on TV at my mum's, that's why.

891
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,680
I don't know if it's true.

892
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,920
In America

893
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,160
they're going to take all the rich people's ashes,

894
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,760
put them in a satellite

895
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,000
and shoot it into space.

896
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,360
The satellite's going to shine forever.

897
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,280
And Lady Di...

898
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,480
Will they do the same for her?

899
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:53,480
Lady Di, Lady Di!

900
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:54,760
Give it a rest!

901
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:57,440
I can't concentrate.

902
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,480
Lady Di!

903
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,480
Lady Di!

904
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:04,720
Renoir.

905
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:42,880
Morning, sir.

906
01:28:58,920 --> 01:28:59,920
Cambodia.

907
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,960
I don't understand.

908
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,720
Brilliant! You couldn't have done better.

909
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:13,840
- Did it work? - It's getting there.

910
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,640
Ask me again any time. The harm's done.

911
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:20,240
- What do you mean? - Everybody calls me Snow White!

912
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:34,080
- Eva? - Yes?

913
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:37,680
Could you stand in for me at four?

914
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,600
Again?

915
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,200
Close the door!

916
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,200
What's up with him?

917
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:49,920
Is he sulking?

918
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:53,360
- He thinks I smile too much. - He'd rather you frowned?

919
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:56,240
With other men, yes.

920
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:03,080
Nino is late. Amélie can only think of two possible explanations.

921
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,120
Firstly, that he didn't find the photo.

922
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,240
Secondly, before he could assemble it,

923
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:13,400
a gang of bank robbers took him hostage.

924
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,360
The cops gave chase.

925
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,120
They got away,

926
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,800
but he caused a crash.

927
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,920
When he came to,

928
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,560
he'd lost his memory,

929
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,200
An ex-con picked him up,

930
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:31,280
mistook him for a fugitive, and shipped him to Istanbul.

931
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,320
He met some Afghan raiders,

932
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:37,840
who took him to steal some Russian warheads.

933
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:45,000
But their truck hit a mine at the border with Tajikistan.

934
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:50,320
He survived, took to the hills, and became a Mujaheddin.

935
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:53,200
Amélie refuses to get upset for a guy

936
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:57,640
who'll eat borscht all his life in a hat like a tea cosy.

937
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,200
- What can I get you? - A coffee, please.

938
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,040
A coffee.

939
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:43,560
Here's your coffee.

940
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,040
Thank you.

941
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:21,040
He's understood.

942
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:24,120
He's going to put his teaspoon down,

943
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,960
dip his finger in the sugar,

944
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:36,080
turn around slowly,

945
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,160
and speak to me.

946
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,440
Excuse me.

947
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:48,040
Is this you?

948
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,480
Yes, it's you.

949
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:17,280
I'll take that.

950
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,240
Another coffee?

951
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,320
- No, thanks. I'm fine. - OK.

952
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:47,280
So it's this man here, the one with his hand up?

953
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,520
Yes.

954
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:54,520
Is she in love with him?

955
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:58,200
Yes.

956
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:03,280
I think it's time she took a real risk.

957
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:07,640
She might just do that. She's devising a stratagem.

958
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:11,160
She's fond of stratagems.

959
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:14,160
Yes.

960
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,840
In fact, she's cowardly.

961
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:22,360
That's why I can't capture her look.

962
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:29,400
Dufayel's attempts to meddle are intolerable!

963
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:37,560
If Amélie chooses to live in a dream

964
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:41,600
and remain an introverted young woman,

965
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:46,160
she has an absolute right to mess up her life!

966
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:21,160
What are you doing, Mr. Dufayel?

967
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,480
Tell me, Lucien.

968
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:30,200
For deliveries, do you keep keys to all the apartments?

969
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:45,880
One of your booths is out of order.

970
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,360
It seems to be jammed.

971
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,640
Gare de l'Est ticket hall.

972
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:58,600
- Buy a video, get one free. - No, thanks.

973
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,720
Sam?

974
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:08,680
Samantha?

975
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:12,880
Samantha?

976
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,440
Can you stand in for me at...

977
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,520
Photo booth, Gare de l'Est ticket hall, Tuesday 5pm.

978
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,320
Almost done.

979
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:06,200
The mystery man wasn't a ghost or a man scared of ageing,

980
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:08,200
but simply the repairman,

981
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:10,640
a normal guy doing his job.

982
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:14,200
Sorry.

983
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,240
He keeps spying on me! It's making me sick.

984
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:04,560
4:05: Blatant female conspiracy.

985
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:08,880
Gosh, you're tense, Georgette!

986
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,400
Good luck. You'll need it.

987
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:20,920
Excuse me. Did you put this in my pocket?

988
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:24,320
- Yes, but I'm not the one... - I know. Where is she?

989
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:25,840
She's at her father's.

990
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:31,080
It's awkward. I'd like to speak to you, but... I finish work at six.

991
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:33,000
- Can you come back? - OK.

992
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
See you later.

993
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:38,480
4:08: Docking scheduled.

994
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:13,520
The blond guy in a camel coat. He's very absent-minded, too.

995
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,240
How come?

996
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:18,600
He came back three times the same afternoon.

997
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,000
1:12:

998
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:22,240
Camel coat.

999
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:23,560
2:50:

1000
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,320
Camel coat.

1001
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,520
- 4:17: Camel coat. - Stop it!

1002
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:31,600
My rash has come back! Look, Suzanne!

1003
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:35,160
My rash is back. He's driving me nuts.

1004
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:37,280
Lay off!

1005
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:41,440
If she had a clear conscience, she wouldn't be in such a state.

1006
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,360
I've had it. I'm going home.

1007
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:46,800
Psychos are the last straw!

1008
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:50,080
Georgette! Georg...

1009
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:54,240
Stop smothering them! Women need to breathe.

1010
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:57,400
You let them breathe, they want a change of air.

1011
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,240
Fresh air's healthy.

1012
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,240
Shut it, failure!

1013
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:05,320
Failed writer, failed life...

1014
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:07,840
I love the word "fail".

1015
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:09,800
Failure is human destiny.

1016
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:11,400
It's gasbag time!

1017
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:14,560
Failure teaches us that life is but a draft,

1018
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:18,320
a long rehearsal for a show that will never play.

1019
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:21,920
I bet he stole that.

1020
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:24,320
I do have some original ideas,

1021
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:29,640
but people always steal them. A bit like your women.

1022
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:31,600
Meaning?

1023
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,760
Meaning you'd better get used to it.

1024
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,200
Speak for yourself, you...

1025
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:38,280
What?

1026
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:44,880
- What's going on? - Nothing much. Georgette went out.

1027
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:46,560
Joseph got mad.

1028
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:48,080
"Went out?"

1029
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:53,080
Just like Gina. You know who's she's with? The guy with the plastic bag.

1030
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:57,040
I saw their little game.

1031
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:59,320
The note in the coat pocket,

1032
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:00,920
4:08.

1033
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:04,760
Back he comes, and hey presto! Out they go.

1034
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:12,040
- I'm worried for Amélie because I like you. - What do you mean?

1035
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,680
By and large, the men I like are mentally unsound.

1036
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:19,600
- I'd like to know more about you. - Ask me questions.

1037
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,000
One swallow doesn't make...?

1038
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,080
A swallow?

1039
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,080
A summer.

1040
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,440
And clothes...?

1041
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:31,960
The man.

1042
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,360
- A good cat deserves...? - A rat.

1043
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,000
- Patience...? - Is a virtue.

1044
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,560
- Rolling stone...? - Gathers no moss.

1045
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:38,800
- It's a sin...? - To steal a pin.

1046
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,800
Absence makes...?

1047
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,240
The heart grow fonder.

1048
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:44,160
- Not bad. - You collect them?

1049
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:48,360
In my family, we say a man who knows his proverbs can't be all bad.

1050
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:56,080
Pretty girl from the 5th floor, listen to this!

1051
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:59,000
- Do you believe in miracles? - Not today.

1052
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,400
You're in for a surprise.

1053
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:05,680
What if I told you that a team of climbers

1054
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:09,480
on Mont Blanc had found

1055
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:14,000
hard proof that my husband loved me?

1056
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:48,040
Lucien, I need some yeast.

1057
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:51,800
For Miss Amélie? She's baking her famous plum cake?

1058
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,720
Collignon! Go and get the yeast.

1059
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,240
Amélie?

1060
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:49,280
Amélie?

1061
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:57,320
Amélie?

1062
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,920
Go into the bedroom, Miss Poulain.

1063
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:10,360
So, little Amélie,

1064
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:14,320
your bones aren't made of glass.

1065
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:17,360
You can take life's knocks.

1066
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:21,600
If you let this chance go by,

1067
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:28,000
eventually your heart will become

1068
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:33,840
as dry and brittle as my skeleton.

1069
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:36,880
So...

1070
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:39,960
Go and get him, for pete's sake!

1071
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:26,200
[Without you, today's emotions would be the scurf of yesterday's]

1072
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:21,880
International airport.

1073
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:26,760
September 28th 1997. It is exactly 11am.

1074
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,360
At the funfair, near the ghost train,

1075
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:32,440
the marshmallow twister is twisting.

1076
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:34,720
Meanwhile, on a bench in Villette Square,

1077
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:39,960
Félix Lerbier learns there are more links in his brain than atoms in the universe.

1078
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:42,080
Meanwhile,

1079
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:45,680
at the Sacré Cœur, the nuns are practicing their backhand.

1080
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:48,040
The temperature is 24°C,

1081
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:49,880
humidity 70%,

1082
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:53,040
atmospheric pressure 999 millibars.
