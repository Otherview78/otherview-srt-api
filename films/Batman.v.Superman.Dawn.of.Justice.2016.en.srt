1
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:20,185
There was a time above.

2
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,855
A time before.

3
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:25,824
There were perfect things,

4
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,127
diamond absolutes.

5
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,530
How things fall.

6
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,033
Things on earth.

7
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:36,068
And what falls...

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,169
Master Wayne!

9
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,004
...is fallen. Bruce!

10
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,441
Bruce, it's all right.

11
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,378
Bruce, please.

12
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,757
Martha.

13
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:47,653
In the dream, they took me to the light.

14
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,554
A beautiful lie.

15
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,168
Jack. Bruce.

16
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,936
Jack, listen to me.

17
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,605
I want you to get everyone out of the building right now.

18
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,441
You understand? Oh, my God.

19
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,142
Stay away from the windows!

20
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,278
Let's go. Come on. Start moving now, people. Let's go.

21
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,380
The boss wants us out of the building, so let's make it happen.

22
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,582
Jack. Jack!

23
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,984
We're sorry.

24
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:37,456
All circuits are busy now. Will you please try your call again later?

25
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,358
Heavenly God,

26
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,329
creator of heaven and earth,

27
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,031
have mercy on my soul.

28
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,702
Jack!

29
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,977
Buddy hands! Everybody show me! Good job!

30
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,712
Come on, guys.

31
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,582
Hold on tight.

32
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,018
Come on, guys.

33
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,621
Go.

34
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:43,855
Mr. Wayne!

35
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,359
Mr. Wayne! I can't feel my legs.

36
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,793
I can't feel my legs.

37
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,029
We need help over here!

38
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,497
Help me. I can't feel my legs.

39
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:55,000
You're gonna be okay. You hear me?

40
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,402
Wallace? What do they call you, Wally? Huh?

41
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,639
You're the boss, boss.

42
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,476
All right. You're gonna be okay.

43
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:06,011
Easy, easy. Come on.

44
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,416
Oh, my God. I can't move my leg.

45
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,752
My God. I can't feel my legs.

46
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,995
It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

47
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:27,399
You're okay. All right? Huh?

48
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,000
You know what? We're gonna find your Mom.

49
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,635
Where is she?

50
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,193
All that wind is bad luck.

51
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,228
Blood in the sky.

52
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,763
Oh, there she is!

53
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,239
Miss Lane.

54
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,710
Miss Lane. Jimmy Olsen.

55
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,878
Photographer. Obviously.

56
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,313
Where's Heron?

57
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,115
Uh, trouble at the border.

58
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:02,387
So, uh, how'd you land it? This is, like, pioneer stuff.

59
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,723
Amajagh's never given an interview.

60
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,792
You know what heron always says when we're on assignment together?

61
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,662
Not a goddamn thing.

62
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:12,797
I like Heron.

63
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,746
Let's go.

64
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,521
Passports. Electronics. Phones. Camera.

65
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,090
Your fixer said that the General approved photos.

66
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,117
Um...

67
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,922
Are you a terrorist, General?

68
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:13,758
They did not tell me the interview was with a lady.

69
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,060
I'm not a lady. I'm a journalist.

70
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,100
What I am is a man with nothing

71
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:25,804
except a love of my people.

72
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,806
Who's paying for these security contractors, General?

73
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,708
Who pays for the drones that pass over our heads at night?

74
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,112
One question begs another.

75
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,780
Yes?

76
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,615
Say what you're saying, General.

77
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,918
It's just a camera.

78
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,821
The United States has declared its neutrality in your country's civil war

79
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,790
both in policy and in principle.

80
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,560
Oh, don't open... You just exposed...

81
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:53,164
These pious American fictions...

82
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,833
...spoken like truth.

83
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,901
Okay. That's my film.

84
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,110
Men with power obey neither policy nor principle, Miss Lane.

85
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,515
No one is different.

86
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,618
No one is neutral.

87
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,462
CIA.

88
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,532
They're tracking us!

89
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,434
You!

90
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,873
You're CIA?

91
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,407
What? No. No!

92
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,543
You brought him here! No, he's a photographer.

93
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,880
No!

94
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,253
It's okay, Lois.

95
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,538
Talon's down, sir.

96
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,741
Python, we have lost our asset on the ground.

97
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,910
Repeat, we have lost our asset on the ground.

98
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,913
There's still a civilian in the compound. We'll extract her.

99
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,849
Negative. RPA to engage. Stand down and get black.

100
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:21,185
There'll be friendlies in the blast zone, so...

101
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,388
Call off the goddamn drone.

102
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,024
Stand down is an order. Python?

103
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,659
Let's move!

104
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,535
I...

105
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:38,970
I didn't know.

106
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:43,942
Ignorance is not the same as innocence,

107
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,310
Miss Lane.

108
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,540
Get up! Stand up!

109
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,821
Quickly. He's coming.

110
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,669
Inbound 2 Mikes.

111
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,171
Passing python now.

112
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,414
Move out!

113
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,524
Target locked. You are clear to engage.

114
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,226
Armed hot and in range.

115
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,966
Three.

116
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,903
Two. One.

117
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,049
Link's been hit.

118
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,617
By what?

119
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,589
Take one step,

120
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,491
you will see the inside of her head.

121
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,011
The women in the village heard a noise.

122
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:12,617
Like the sky cracked open.

123
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:17,321
He came down. Then came fire.

124
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,659
Even worse came after.

125
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,995
The Government attacked.

126
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,831
No mercy in the villages.

127
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,400
My parents tried to run.

128
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:37,208
The world has been so caught up with what Superman can do

129
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,678
that no one has asked what he should do.

130
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,983
Let the record show that this committee holds him responsible.

131
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,152
He'll never answer to you.

132
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,821
He answers to no one.

133
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,291
Not even, I think, to God.

134
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,495
58 to nothing.

135
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,697
Metropolis, again, blowing out Gotham city.

136
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,166
Really, only the diehards are left in the stands.

137
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,368
Delta Charlie 27. Reports of screams coming from vacant home

138
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,304
at 1939 Harborway.

139
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,838
Tom, it's been great working with you.

140
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,141
I want to thank our producer and director.

141
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:11,676
Now wait a second. I don't even want to suggest...

142
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:12,543
Delta Charlie 27, respond.

143
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,845
Just take a knee.

144
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,914
They're lining up as if clarkson is gonna throw it deep here.

145
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,150
- Don't tell me, Dave. - Going to the end zone!

146
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,352
- This is unnecessary. - Delta Charlie 27

147
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,187
- Zeke Baker is open. - Baker with a touchdown catch!

148
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,855
I can't believe I just watched that.

149
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,424
Delta Charlie 27. Do you copy?

150
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,759
10-4. We're on it.

151
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,995
And now a fight breaks out.

152
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:34,232
Gotham city, you know how they are about their football team.

153
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,201
Things could get ugly in the city tonight.

154
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,611
Go.

155
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,658
It's okay.

156
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,259
It's okay.

157
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:38,062
We're gonna help. We're here to help.

158
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:40,498
We're gonna get you out of here. Okay?

159
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,043
I don't understand.

160
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,683
Please don't. Please don't.

161
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:10,528
Please. I don't know who he is.

162
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,032
I don't know who he is!

163
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,870
No!

164
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,258
Oh, fuck.

165
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:22,533
Christ!

166
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:24,101
I saw him.

167
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,903
I never saw him before. I... I didn't know.

168
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,705
You almost took my face off.

169
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:30,141
How about you don't shoot the good guys, huh?

170
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,377
Oh. Oh.

171
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:35,679
Jesus Christ.

172
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,281
He branded him.

173
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,173
Hey. Hey.

174
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,441
I was gonna cook.

175
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:12,076
Surprise you.

176
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,583
They held hearings about what happened.

177
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,319
They're saying that... I don't care.

178
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:24,722
I don't care what they're saying.

179
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,292
The woman I love could have been blown up or shot.

180
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:29,994
Think of what could have happened.

181
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:32,463
Well, think about what did happen.

182
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:34,865
I didn't kill those men, if that's what they think.

183
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,634
If that's what you're saying.

184
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:39,069
No, I'm saying I want to understand what happened.

185
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,806
I'm saying thank you for saving my life.

186
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:44,608
I'm saying there's a cost.

187
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,553
I just don't know if it's possible.

188
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,455
Don't know if what's possible?

189
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,761
For you to love me and be you.

190
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,756
Clark!

191
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,360
Clark, you're going to flood the apartment.

192
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:38,529
Mmm-hmm.

193
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,564
You still working?

194
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:15,966
You're getting slow in your old age, Alfred.

195
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,336
Comes to us all, Master Wayne.

196
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:22,039
Even you got too old to die young.

197
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,876
And not for lack of trying.

198
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,280
Funnel-ferry butterbar. Funnel-ferry butterbar.

199
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,316
Funnel-ferry butterbar. Funnel-ferry...

200
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,485
There's nothing wrong with the microphone.

201
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:37,621
It's this new layer of armor.

202
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,556
I'll just have to rewire.

203
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:45,996
So, last night was productive?

204
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:49,933
No. He's too low-level. He knew nothing.

205
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:52,369
This is the man who knows things.

206
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:56,273
Anatoli Knyazev. He's Russian.

207
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,808
Contracts all over the globe,

208
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,176
but he's based out of the port of Gotham.

209
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,978
Weapons and human trafficking.

210
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,846
So the white Portuguese is a Russian.

211
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,982
That's the theory.

212
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:09,620
No. The theory is that the Russian will lead me to the man himself.

213
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:13,624
If he is, indeed, a "him."

214
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:15,025
You don't even know if he exists.

215
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,560
Could be a Phantasm.

216
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:19,797
One that wants to bring a dirty bomb into Gotham?

217
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,598
Ah, high-stakes round.

218
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,570
New rules.

219
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,175
We're criminals, Alfred.

220
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:33,711
We've always been criminals. Nothing's changed.

221
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,880
Oh, yes, it has, sir.

222
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,117
Everything's changed.

223
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,790
Men fall from the sky.

224
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,394
The Gods hurl thunderbolts.

225
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,130
Innocents die.

226
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,034
That's how it starts, sir.

227
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:59,203
The fever. The rage.

228
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:02,139
The feeling of powerlessness.

229
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:08,145
It turns good men cruel.

230
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,092
John, get D.

231
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,862
Ooh. Ah. Ahoy, ahoy! I did not know you were here.

232
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,930
Man on the Marquee. Yeah, don't believe it.

233
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,565
My father named the company after himself.

234
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,768
He was the Lex in front of the Corp. How you doin'?

235
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,369
Oh, really great.

236
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,938
Really great? Good. Good. Uh, follow me.

237
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,641
No, uh, Dad started saying that he named the company,

238
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,443
uh, after his kid at investor pitches.

239
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,745
Rich old ladies. They thought it was very cute, you know?

240
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,614
"Write check for Lex."

241
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:46,784
You know, Dad was born in East Germany.

242
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:49,119
He grew up eating, uh, stale crackers.

243
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,321
And every other Saturday, he had to march in a parade

244
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:53,390
and wave flowers at Tyrants.

245
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:57,127
So, I think it was Providence that his son, me,

246
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,729
would end up with this.

247
00:29:58,731 --> 00:30:01,331
One of my rebuild Metropolis crews found it.

248
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,934
Little souvenir from the Kryptonian world engine.

249
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,769
What does a rock have to do with homeland security?

250
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:07,771
Homeland security? Hmm.

251
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:11,475
No, no, no, ma'am, planetary security.

252
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,510
The fragment is of a radioactive xenomineral.

253
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:16,313
We suspected it might have bio-interactions,

254
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,316
so we took the sample to amriid,

255
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,452
where they keep the remains of the Kryptonian decedent.

256
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:25,956
And, when we exposed General Zod to the mineral,

257
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:28,158
this happened.

258
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,629
Profound biodegradation. Decaying Kryptonian cells.

259
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,164
We concluded the mineral could be weaponized

260
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,699
if a large enough sample was found.

261
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:39,336
And then, among the fishes, a whale.

262
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,838
Ah!

263
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,340
Lying at the bottom of the Indian ocean.

264
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,509
Emerald city.

265
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,444
Beautiful.

266
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,012
Now, rocky is radioactive,

267
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:52,115
but what he needs from you is an import license.

268
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:54,852
And why would we want to weaponize this material?

269
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:56,019
As a deterrent.

270
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,521
A silver bullet to keep in reserve,

271
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:58,789
to use against the Kryptonians,

272
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:00,691
so the day does not come, Madam,

273
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,492
when your children are waving daisies at a reviewing stand.

274
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,194
Last I looked, the only one of those

275
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,829
flying around up here was Superman.

276
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:09,032
Ha-ha, yes. Superman. Yeah, but there are, uh...

277
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,467
There are more of them.

278
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:11,835
The metahuman thesis.

279
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:13,237
Yes, the metahuman thesis.

280
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,638
More likely than not

281
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,740
these exceptional beings live among us.

282
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:19,543
The basis of our myths. Gods among men upon

283
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,044
our little blue planet here.

284
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,182
Now, you don't have to use a silver bullet.

285
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,718
But if you forge one...

286
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,419
Well, then

287
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:32,089
we don't have to depend upon the kindness of monsters.

288
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:39,830
There are ways we can help each other.

289
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:42,065
Would you step into my office here?

290
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,704
Yes.

291
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,473
What's your wish list?

292
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,610
Uh...

293
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:56,113
Access to the wreck of the crashed Kryptonian ship?

294
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,449
Done.

295
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,268
The complete remains of the dead alien for testing.

296
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,204
You want Zod's body?

297
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,873
Okay.

298
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:13,657
Mmm.

299
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,244
It's cherry.

300
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,415
Mmm-mmm.

301
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,152
Because the time has come

302
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:45,455
for the world to hear the other side of the story.

303
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:48,692
They say that Superman is a hero. Okay, but whose hero?

304
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,994
If Superman were here right now,

305
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:53,130
what would you want to say to him?

306
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:55,532
That my family, too, had dreams.

307
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,369
To look him in his eye

308
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:02,472
and ask him how he decides...

309
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:03,874
...which lives count.

310
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,410
And which ones do not.

311
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,014
Sir, get down.

312
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,985
Sir, I said get down!

313
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:25,455
Now!

314
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,023
Can we get some backup here?

315
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,926
Hey! Hey! Don't do it!

316
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,128
Hey!

317
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,066
Lois! Crime lab, on three.

318
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,269
- This is Lane. - Kent.

319
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:40,904
You're sports today.

320
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:43,106
I want you to go to Gotham, follow up on football.

321
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:47,911
"Underdog dreams dashed: Ten yards between Gotham and glory."

322
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:50,280
Oh, um, watch yourself over there in Gotham.

323
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:51,722
Don't let them take your lunch money.

324
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,818
Hey. Are you guys watching this?

325
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,620
Emergency responders quickly created

326
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:58,989
a precautionary perimeter around heroes park

327
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:01,691
while they brought the man down from this beloved monument.

328
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:05,162
The suspect has been identified as Wallace Vernon Keefe.

329
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:06,429
I work for Bruce Wayne!

330
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,198
I work for Bruce Wayne!

331
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,600
He'll be arraigned on charges of vandalism,

332
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,135
resisting arrest,

333
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,271
and the felony charge of making terrorist threats.

334
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:16,339
That carries up to 40 years in prison.

335
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,541
Poor son of a bitch.

336
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:19,643
Metropolis News 8.

337
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,278
Jenny. Hmm.

338
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,481
Headline: "End of love affair with man in the sky,

339
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,049
"question mark."

340
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,285
Okay.

341
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,927
Is she in?

342
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,597
No, she's been gone.

343
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,899
What'd she do, officer?

344
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,101
Oh, I'm not a cop.

345
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:19,436
I'm a reporter.

346
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,240
The young lady living here...

347
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,175
She hasn't been back.

348
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:26,910
In fact, if she's smart, then she's got out of this city.

349
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,013
And you need to get out of here before dark.

350
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:31,514
Unless you want to run into him.

351
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:33,283
Don't listen to that nonsense.

352
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:36,920
Only people scared of him, people who got reason to be.

353
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,755
Scared of who?

354
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:41,124
There's a new kind of mean in him.

355
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,526
He is angry.

356
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,529
And he's hunting.

357
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:51,935
Show 'em what you got!

358
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,770
Let's go. Come on!

359
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,341
Throw a punch, will ya?

360
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,145
Let's go! Come on!

361
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,536
Thank you.

362
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,814
The house treats luck like an insult.

363
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,650
Good luck for one is always his brother's misfortune.

364
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,823
Three nights with a Bolshoi Ballerina,

365
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,591
that line was all she taught me.

366
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:51,594
Not all, I'm sure. Good evening.

367
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,002
It's like a one-man reign of terror.

368
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:02,839
This Bat vigilante has been consistently targeting the port

369
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,841
and the adjacent projects and tenements.

370
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,843
And, as far as I can tell, the cops are actually helping him.

371
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,813
"Crime wave in Gotham."

372
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:13,016
Other breaking news: "Water, wet."

373
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,617
Did you file the football yet?

374
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,519
Why aren't we covering this?

375
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,521
Poor people don't buy papers?

376
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,657
People don't buy papers, period, Kent.

377
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:22,058
Perry, when you assign a story,

378
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,827
you're making a choice about who matters.

379
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,195
And who's worth it.

380
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:26,996
Good morning, Smallville.

381
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:30,667
The American conscience died with Robert, Martin, and John.

382
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:33,837
Sorry. I'm sorry.

383
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,940
No match. My guys in the crime lab never seen one before.

384
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,410
It's called a bullet. You shoot people with them.

385
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:41,911
Recovered from the scene

386
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,580
of the firefight in the desert.

387
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:45,882
Not sold anywhere commercially in the world,

388
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,083
even black market.

389
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:48,485
So?

390
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,387
So who gave prototype military rounds

391
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:51,855
to Tuareg fighters in the Sahara?

392
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,490
You're the reporter. Tell me.

393
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:55,258
I think that the us government is arming the rebels

394
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,893
while claiming to support the elected government.

395
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,561
The ask, Lois.

396
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,494
Flight to D.C. tonight. Couple of days there.

397
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,836
Go.

398
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,172
Coach. No extra legroom.

399
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,009
Economy plus.

400
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,277
Coach!

401
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,914
So, why didn't you tell me?

402
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,185
You're digging up snakes, Lo.

403
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,188
It's kind of dangerous.

404
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,123
That is why I didn't tell you.

405
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,605
Lane, don't you have a plane to catch?

406
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,660
Yes, sir.

407
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,731
Benefit for the library of Metropolis.

408
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:37,767
Someone on the committee requested that Clark Kent cover it.

409
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,004
Probably some old charity crone who's got a thing for nerds.

410
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,782
Senator.

411
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,452
Little bourbon before lunch?

412
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,587
My driver's outside. I can't stay.

413
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:59,456
No bourbon?

414
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,957
Kentucky girl like yourself?

415
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,460
Hmm.

416
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:06,329
My Dad always said that Kentucky mash

417
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,298
was the secret to health.

418
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,966
Mmm.

419
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,402
This was his room.

420
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,172
I kept it just the same.

421
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,476
Mmm.

422
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:25,815
"Maybe one day Dad'll come back if I just keep everything the same."

423
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,383
That is silly.

424
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,488
The magical thinking of orphan boys.

425
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,224
I'm blocking the import license for your mineral.

426
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,933
The redcapes are coming.

427
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,604
The redcapes are coming.

428
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:48,671
Hmm...

429
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,209
You and your hearings.

430
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,749
Galloping through the streets to warn us.

431
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:02,886
One if by land,

432
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:04,888
two if by air.

433
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,256
Mmm.

434
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,030
Do you know the oldest lie in America, Senator?

435
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,231
Can I call you June?

436
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:18,034
You can call me whatever you like.

437
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,737
Take a bucket of piss and call it granny's peach tea.

438
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:22,305
Mmm-hmm.

439
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:23,740
Take a weapon of assassination

440
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:25,441
and call it deterrence.

441
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,212
You won't fool a fly or me.

442
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,782
I'm not gonna drink it.

443
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,822
You don't think Dad would mind, do you?

444
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:44,761
If I changed just... Just one thing in this room?

445
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,599
Because that should be upside-down.

446
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,836
We know better now, don't we?

447
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:56,973
The Devils don't come from Hell beneath us. No.

448
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:00,109
No, they come from the sky.

449
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:57,727
Oh.

450
00:44:57,729 --> 00:44:59,562
I hope the next generation of Waynes

451
00:44:59,564 --> 00:45:03,466
won't inherit an empty wine cellar.

452
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:06,602
Not that there's likely to be a next generation.

453
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,138
Thank you, sir.

454
00:45:12,177 --> 00:45:15,745
This is every call made from the Russian's phone.

455
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:18,214
Two mentions of business with the White Portuguese.

456
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:21,150
And it's continually transmitting blacked-out data

457
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:22,819
to the personal residence

458
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:24,487
of Alexander Luthor.

459
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:28,357
You think Lex Luthor is the White Portuguese?

460
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:32,361
I can't see that he needs the income from imported arms.

461
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:34,397
Regardless, I'll need to put a leech at his house,

462
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:35,732
and I'm gonna need the suit.

463
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,834
The bat interrogated six people

464
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:39,836
and came away with nothing.

465
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,906
It was Bruce Wayne that got the information.

466
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:47,076
Well, Bruce Wayne can't break into Lex Luthor's house.

467
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,811
Bruce Wayne won't have to.

468
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,081
He's been invited.

469
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,490
Who's that?

470
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:09,926
You must be new to the "let them eat cake" beat.

471
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:12,695
That is Bruce Wayne.

472
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:14,931
Philanthropist, bibliophile...

473
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:18,134
True friend of the library of Metropolis.

474
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:19,535
Mr. Lex Luthor.

475
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:22,238
Me? Ah. Okay.

476
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:29,111
Nicky. Uh...

477
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:31,347
You're embarrassing me. Um...

478
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,382
Speech, speech. Uh...

479
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:35,017
Blah, blah, blah. Uh...

480
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,486
Open bar.

481
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:39,488
The end.

482
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,225
Uh...

483
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:45,228
The word "philanthropist" comes from the Greek.

484
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,829
Meaning a lover of humanity.

485
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:49,899
Uh, it was coined about 2,500 years ago.

486
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:51,667
All right. Where am I going, Alfred?

487
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:53,836
Go past the elevator.

488
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:55,371
Do a left.

489
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,541
That's right, must be.

490
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,877
It's in the service corridor in the basement.

491
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:02,345
Go down the stairs.

492
00:48:02,347 --> 00:48:04,647
Gods and men. Prometheus went with us.

493
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:07,383
And he ruined Zeus' plan to destroy mankind,

494
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,945
and for that he was given a thunderbolt.

495
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:12,221
Hmm, that seems unfair.

496
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:15,224
Um... on a serious note, the library of Metropolis...

497
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,159
Go to the stairs. You saw them on your way in. Down the stairs.

498
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:20,897
But at one time, Dad could not buy them. No.

499
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:23,032
My father could not afford books growing up.

500
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:25,514
He had to root through the garbage for yesterday's newspaper.

501
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:28,805
All right. You got the kitchens on your right.

502
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,540
Do a left.

503
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:33,776
Right in front of you. That's where you want to be.

504
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,928
May I help you, Mr. Wayne?

505
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:54,297
Uh, I just...

506
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:57,066
I thought the bathroom was down here. I must have...

507
00:48:57,068 --> 00:49:00,770
That last martini was two too many, I think.

508
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:02,238
Men's room is upstairs.

509
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,839
Great. I'm okay.

510
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,008
I like those shoes.

511
00:49:10,882 --> 00:49:12,782
I can't stay down here, Alfred.

512
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,250
Go upstairs and socialize.

513
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:15,952
Some young lady from Metropolis

514
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:17,286
will make you honest.

515
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,324
In your dreams, Alfred.

516
00:49:21,326 --> 00:49:22,825
Books are knowledge,

517
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:26,395
and knowledge is power, and I am...

518
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:27,997
No. Uh, um...

519
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:31,000
No. What am I? I... What was I saying? No.

520
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,737
The bittersweet pain among men

521
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:38,607
is having knowledge with no power, because...

522
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:41,544
Because that is paradoxical! And, um...

523
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,982
Thank you for coming.

524
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:49,018
Please drink. Drink.

525
00:49:57,861 --> 00:50:02,164
Mr. Wayne? Mr. Wayne? Clark Kent, Daily Planet.

526
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,266
Uh, my foundation has already issued a statement

527
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:06,335
in support of books.

528
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,504
Sir? Um...

529
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,207
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit. Don't quote me.

530
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:12,875
All right?

531
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:15,845
What's your position on the Bat vigilante in Gotham?

532
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:18,547
Daily Planet. Do I own this one? Or is that the other guy?

533
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:22,151
Civil liberties are being trampled on in your city.

534
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:23,519
Good people are living in fear.

535
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,491
Don't believe everything you hear, son.

536
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:31,861
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne. He thinks he's above the law.

537
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:38,234
The Daily Planet criticizing those who think they're above the law

538
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:42,405
is a little hypocritical, wouldn't you say?

539
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:45,174
Considering every time your hero saves a cat out of a tree,

540
00:50:45,176 --> 00:50:47,476
you write a puff piece editorial

541
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:50,212
about an alien who, if he wanted to,

542
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:52,982
could burn the whole place down.

543
00:50:52,984 --> 00:50:55,818
There wouldn't be a damn thing we could do to stop him.

544
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,890
Most of the world doesn't share your opinion, Mr. Wayne.

545
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:04,360
Maybe it's the Gotham city in me.

546
00:51:04,362 --> 00:51:05,828
We just have a bad history

547
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,596
with freaks dressed like clowns.

548
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,100
Boys! Um!

549
00:51:11,102 --> 00:51:13,702
Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent. Ha!

550
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,704
I love it. I love bringing people together.

551
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:16,739
How are we?

552
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,507
Lex. Hello. Good.

553
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:21,010
Hi, hello, Lex, it is a pleasure. Ow!

554
00:51:21,012 --> 00:51:22,611
Wow! That is a good grip!

555
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:25,414
You should not pick a fight with this person. Huh.

556
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,716
So, after all these years, we finally got you over to Metropolis.

557
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:29,885
Well, I thought I'd come drink you dry.

558
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:31,887
Well, you're welcome. You should hop the Harbor more often, though.

559
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:33,222
I'd love to show you my labs.

560
00:51:33,224 --> 00:51:35,691
Maybe we could partner on something.

561
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:38,594
My R and D is up to all sorts of no good.

562
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,966
That's seven minutes.

563
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:45,408
Looks like the transfer's complete.

564
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,770
Mr. Luthor. Yes?

565
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,605
The Governor. Governor.

566
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,107
Excuse me. Next time.

567
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:52,441
Governor! Hi!

568
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,143
Lex, it's good to see you.

569
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:33,482
Excuse me.

570
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,218
We, as a population on this planet,

571
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,719
have been looking for a savior.

572
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:46,155
90% of people believe in a higher power,

573
00:53:46,157 --> 00:53:47,590
and every religion believes

574
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:49,558
in some sort of messianic figure.

575
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,728
And when this savior character actually comes to earth,

576
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,064
we want to make him abide by our rules?

577
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:57,199
We have to understand that this a paradigm shift.

578
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:59,735
We have to start thinking beyond politics.

579
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:02,404
Are there any moral constraints on this person?

580
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,406
We have international law.

581
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:07,576
On this earth, every act is a political act.

582
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,411
Is it really surprising

583
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,780
that the most powerful man in the world

584
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:14,950
should be a figure of controversy?

585
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:17,519
Uh, to have an individual engaging

586
00:54:17,521 --> 00:54:19,922
in these state-level interventions

587
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:22,057
should give us all pause.

588
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:24,293
Human beings have a horrible track record

589
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:26,562
of following people with great power

590
00:54:26,564 --> 00:54:28,264
down paths that led to

591
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:30,266
huge human atrocities.

592
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:32,801
We have always created icons in our own image.

593
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:36,272
What we've done is we project ourselves onto him.

594
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:39,975
The fact is, maybe he's not some sort of Devil or Jesus character.

595
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:42,444
Maybe he's just a guy trying to do the right thing.

596
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:45,614
We're talking about a being whose very existence

597
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:50,152
challenges our own sense of priority in the universe.

598
00:54:50,154 --> 00:54:51,620
And you go back to copernicus,

599
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,122
where he restored the sun

600
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:54,623
in the center of the known universe,

601
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,125
displacing earth.

602
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:57,960
And you get to darwinian evolution,

603
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:00,129
and you find out we're not special on this earth,

604
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:02,965
we're just one among other lifeforms.

605
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,833
And now we learn that we're not even

606
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:06,302
special in the entire universe

607
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:09,171
because there is Superman.

608
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:12,841
There he is. An alien among us.

609
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:14,943
We're not alone.

610
00:55:14,945 --> 00:55:17,146
Are you, as a United States Senator,

611
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:21,583
personally comfortable saying to a grieving parent,

612
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:25,154
"Superman could have saved your child,

613
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:29,358
"but on principle, we did not want him to act"?

614
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,327
I'm not saying he shouldn't act.

615
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,262
I'm saying he shouldn't act unilaterally.

616
00:55:33,264 --> 00:55:35,497
What are we talking about here, then?

617
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:38,200
Must there be a Superman?

618
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,570
There is.

619
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:55,651
Hello?

620
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:57,019
Mom?

621
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,253
Clark!

622
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,656
What is it?

623
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:01,890
What's wrong?

624
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:04,126
No. Nothing. I just...

625
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,297
Hi.

626
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,767
Hi.

627
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:16,105
How come Dad never left Kansas?

628
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,044
Well, he just...

629
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,546
You know how he was.

630
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,548
"What do I need to travel for?

631
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,117
"I'm already there."

632
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,121
Just wish it was more simple.

633
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,225
My baby boy.

634
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,462
Nothing was ever simple.

635
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,438
An odd little duck.

636
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:52,908
Hmm!

637
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,309
I've never seen a metal like this.

638
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:59,214
Could be Darpa Black Box.

639
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:00,883
Who could find out?

640
00:57:00,885 --> 00:57:02,851
Nobody who'd want to.

641
00:57:02,853 --> 00:57:05,721
Maybe they gave them out to the rebels to test in theater.

642
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:08,924
Using live soldiers as Guinea pigs?

643
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:11,794
This is what makes you such a good reporter.

644
00:57:11,796 --> 00:57:13,095
Stuff like this still shocks you.

645
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,119
It don't come off!

646
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,221
It don't come off!

647
00:57:39,223 --> 00:57:41,457
Prisoner transfer!

648
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:43,725
You can't put me in General, man. They gonna kill me.

649
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:45,327
Hey, you can't bring me to General.

650
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:46,628
You should be thanking the tax payers of Metropolis

651
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,397
for taking in your branded ass.

652
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:49,998
Sign here, please. I'm marked, man.

653
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,633
You know what they do to people with this on them?

654
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,168
He's only a criminal.

655
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,670
This way! Let's go! They're gonna kill me!

656
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:55,971
- They're gonna kill me! - Let's go!

657
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,072
Keefe.

658
00:57:57,074 --> 00:57:58,807
You made bail.

659
00:57:58,809 --> 00:57:59,875
Open two.

660
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:06,849
Who paid?

661
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,329
Who the hell are you?

662
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,202
Just a man.

663
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:29,404
Yeah? Well, what the fuck do you want?

664
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:35,717
To help you stand for something.

665
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,618
Your three o'clock's here.

666
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,264
He made me half a man.

667
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,901
My wife

668
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:01,103
walked out on me.

669
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:06,275
I can't even piss standing up.

670
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,944
Let me face him.

671
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,414
You'll take care of it?

672
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,284
Good.

673
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:41,977
What?

674
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,431
Wrong room, Miss.

675
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:03,899
Secretary Swanwick,

676
01:00:03,901 --> 01:00:05,541
you haven't been returning my phone calls.

677
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:09,438
Miss Lane, if you'd like an interview,

678
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,074
Major Farris is just outside that door.

679
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:13,976
You're treating me like a stranger?

680
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:17,446
I'm treating you like a reporter.

681
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:21,216
All right. Is the us providing experimental military arms

682
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:23,051
to rebels in Africa?

683
01:00:23,053 --> 01:00:25,621
You know, with balls like yours,

684
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:27,556
you belong in here.

685
01:00:27,558 --> 01:00:30,759
What's your source on this? A tin foil hat?

686
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:32,794
No, not tin. But it's metal.

687
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:34,630
Fired in the Superman incident.

688
01:00:34,632 --> 01:00:37,065
Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it.

689
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:38,300
We haven't been told the truth.

690
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:39,601
Here's the truth.

691
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:41,069
A reporter got greedy for a scoop

692
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,471
and went where she shouldn't have.

693
01:00:42,473 --> 01:00:44,640
Superman acted like some rogue combatant

694
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:47,309
to rescue her, and people died.

695
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:50,045
Don't invent a conspiracy theory to put back his Halo.

696
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,481
Or yours.

697
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,983
- Major. - Sir.

698
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:57,619
So.

699
01:00:57,621 --> 01:01:00,155
I logged into your dropbox to find copy.

700
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:02,524
There's copy all right.

701
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:06,461
But nothing about football. Nothing about, uh,

702
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:09,765
the friends of the Metropolis library,

703
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:12,668
just the goddamn Gotham Bat thing

704
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,703
I told you not to pursue.

705
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:16,705
If the police won't help, the press has to do the right thing.

706
01:01:16,707 --> 01:01:18,607
You don't get to decide what the right thing is.

707
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:21,009
When the Planet was founded, it stood for something, Perry.

708
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:24,846
And so could you if it was 1938, but it's not 1938.

709
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:28,116
WPA ain't hiring no more. Apples don't cost a nickel.

710
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:31,119
Not in here, not out there. You drop this thing!

711
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,425
Nobody cares about Clark Kent taking on the Batman.

712
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,462
So apparently Superman

713
01:01:40,464 --> 01:01:42,831
doesn't want us to think of him as American anymore.

714
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:44,232
And really, why would we?

715
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:46,168
Aside from the red and blue costume.

716
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,969
And, I don't know, the fact that he has

717
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:50,472
one-third of the USA's initials on his chest.

718
01:01:50,474 --> 01:01:52,074
I assume the only reason he's not wearing

719
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:55,043
the declaration of independence as a cape is...

720
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,678
He thinks it's too on-the-nose.

721
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,647
What is going on back here? No.

722
01:01:58,649 --> 01:02:00,182
Guys, come on. Let's go.

723
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:01,650
Get yourselves together and get out there.

724
01:02:01,652 --> 01:02:03,051
Get those glasses on those trays.

725
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,373
We got thirsty people out there.

726
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:14,896
I wonder, would you excuse us?

727
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:17,733
There's something I'd like to show you. I'm sorry.

728
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:21,036
Now some scholars insist that it never happened...

729
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:23,038
But I believe it's the action

730
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:27,909
perfectly in keeping with a king who was also a psychopathic killer.

731
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:31,680
For me, it's the culmination of 40 years curating.

732
01:02:31,682 --> 01:02:34,683
And I can't believe it, but I've finally got it here.

733
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:38,019
It's the sword of Alexander.

734
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,324
It's the blade that cut the Gordian Knot.

735
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,228
It's a Triumph.

736
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,696
Yes.

737
01:02:47,698 --> 01:02:49,097
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

738
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,473
It's a fake.

739
01:02:58,475 --> 01:03:01,276
The real one was sold in '98 on the black market.

740
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,444
And now it hangs...

741
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:04,780
Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.

742
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,684
Excuse me.

743
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,721
Excuse me, Miss.

744
01:03:12,723 --> 01:03:15,957
The other night you took something that doesn't belong to you.

745
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:18,126
Stealing's not polite.

746
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,796
Is it stealing if you steal from another thief?

747
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,266
Who are you?

748
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:26,835
Someone interested in the same man you are.

749
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:29,771
Is that right?

750
01:03:29,773 --> 01:03:32,841
I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph that belongs to me.

751
01:03:32,843 --> 01:03:34,342
Did you get it?

752
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:36,845
As it happens, no, I didn't.

753
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:39,981
The data you copied has military-grade encryption.

754
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:43,518
You know, I bet with that dress,

755
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,454
9 out of 10 men will let you get away with anything.

756
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:47,956
But you're the 10th?

757
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:50,358
I'm guessing I'm the first

758
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,727
to see through that babe-in-the-woods act.

759
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:55,463
You don't know me,

760
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:57,098
but I've known a few women like you.

761
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:03,538
Oh, I don't think you've ever known a woman like me.

762
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,310
You know, it's true what they say about little boys.

763
01:04:08,312 --> 01:04:11,079
Born with no natural inclination to share.

764
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:14,516
I didn't steal your drive.

765
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,785
I borrowed it.

766
01:04:16,787 --> 01:04:19,754
You'll find it in the glove compartment of your car.

767
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,090
Mr. Wayne.

768
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,471
Did you get it?

769
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:17,806
The rock?

770
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:19,140
Yeah, we got it.

771
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,034
I'm sorry.

772
01:06:47,704 --> 01:06:50,705
Get down! Get down now!

773
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:07,622
No!

774
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,505
She was my world.

775
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,041
And you took her from me.

776
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,521
Bruce!

777
01:09:19,523 --> 01:09:22,590
Bruce! Listen to me now!

778
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:27,996
It's Lois!

779
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:29,931
It's Lois Lane!

780
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:32,200
She's the key!

781
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,604
Am I too soon?

782
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:40,508
I'm too soon!

783
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,844
You're right about him!

784
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:45,680
You've always been right about him!

785
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:48,049
Fear him! Fear him!

786
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:49,951
Find us, Bruce!

787
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,620
You have to find us!

788
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,020
The White Portuguese is not a man.

789
01:10:59,022 --> 01:11:00,121
It's a ship.

790
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:06,027
Master Wayne, since the age of seven

791
01:11:06,029 --> 01:11:08,096
you have been to the art of deception

792
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:10,698
as Mozart to the harpsichord.

793
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,469
But you've never been too hot at lying to me.

794
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:19,374
The White Portuguese is not carrying a dirty bomb.

795
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:21,009
What is it carrying?

796
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:23,544
It's a weapon.

797
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,114
It's a rock.

798
01:11:26,116 --> 01:11:29,717
A mineral capable of weakening Kryptonian cells.

799
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:31,452
The first sample big enough to mean something

800
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,488
turned up in the Indian ocean three months ago.

801
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,456
It is now aboard the white Portuguese

802
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,959
being delivered to Lex Luthor.

803
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,994
Who I am going to steal it from.

804
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:41,929
To keep it out of Luthor's hands.

805
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:43,197
To destroy it.

806
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:45,700
No.

807
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,905
You're gonna go to war?

808
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:56,911
That son of a bitch brought the war to us two years ago.

809
01:11:56,913 --> 01:12:00,515
Jesus, Alfred. Count the dead. Thousands of people.

810
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:04,619
What's next? Millions?

811
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:07,288
He has the power to wipe out the entire human race,

812
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:09,857
and if we believe there's even a 1% chance that he is our enemy,

813
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:13,027
we have to take it as an absolute certainty.

814
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,429
And we have to destroy him.

815
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:17,098
But he is not our enemy.

816
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:19,967
Not today.

817
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:22,670
20 years in Gotham, Alfred.

818
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,605
We've seen what promises are worth.

819
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:27,442
How many good guys are left.

820
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,511
How many stayed that way.

821
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:34,949
14 hours.

822
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,054
My name is Clark Kent. I'm from the Daily Planet.

823
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:48,029
I'm trying to find out what happened to an inmate, a Santos.

824
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:49,597
I can't give out that information.

825
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,549
Mommy!

826
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:14,889
Mrs. Santos?

827
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:17,358
May I ask you a few questions?

828
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,160
He wasn't my husband.

829
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:20,561
But I know what he did.

830
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:23,865
But he was a father.

831
01:13:23,867 --> 01:13:25,833
He was that, too.

832
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:27,435
They took him out of Gotham Central.

833
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:29,670
They moved him to Metropolis.

834
01:13:29,672 --> 01:13:31,572
But inside they know.

835
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:34,075
They know the mark all over. Guards don't care.

836
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:35,476
Bat's the judge.

837
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,246
One man decides who lives.

838
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:40,748
How is that justice? Talk to me.

839
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,785
Help me change it. With what? Your pen?

840
01:13:43,787 --> 01:13:46,721
A man like that, words don't stop him.

841
01:13:46,723 --> 01:13:48,189
You know stops him?

842
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:50,124
A fist.

843
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,363
Kent, I want to talk to you.

844
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,434
Kent!

845
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:01,602
Where does he go? Where does he go, Jenny?

846
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,604
I don't... I don't know.

847
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:04,806
Clicks his heels three times,

848
01:14:04,808 --> 01:14:06,507
goes back to Kansas, I suppose.

849
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:09,577
Son of a...

850
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,824
Turn it!

851
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:24,358
Turn it!

852
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,237
Move out!

853
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,307
Go, go, go, go!

854
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:26,414
No!

855
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:52,867
Where is he?

856
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,449
Next time they shine your light in the sky,

857
01:19:15,451 --> 01:19:17,284
don't go to it.

858
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:19,687
The Bat is dead. Bury it.

859
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:22,590
Consider this mercy.

860
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:26,193
Tell me.

861
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,133
Do you bleed?

862
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,109
You will.

863
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:27,214
I don't have a halo over me, Mr. Secretary.

864
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:29,250
I went into the desert, people died.

865
01:21:29,252 --> 01:21:31,385
It keeps me awake. It should.

866
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:38,893
If you think that Superman is a murderer,

867
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:40,895
then throw it away.

868
01:21:40,897 --> 01:21:42,796
But I don't believe you think that.

869
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:48,903
How do we determine what's good?

870
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:51,739
In a democracy, good is a conversation,

871
01:21:51,741 --> 01:21:54,608
not a unilateral decision.

872
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:57,278
So I urge Superman to come

873
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,079
to this hill of the people tomorrow

874
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:01,782
to see those who have suffered.

875
01:22:01,784 --> 01:22:05,052
The world needs to know what happened in that desert.

876
01:22:05,054 --> 01:22:07,554
And to know what he stands for.

877
01:22:07,556 --> 01:22:09,757
How far will he take his power?

878
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:15,162
Does he act by our will or by his own?

879
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,839
People hate what they don't understand.

880
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:31,111
But they see what you do, and they know who you are.

881
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:35,950
You're not a killer, a threat.

882
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:39,687
I never wanted this world to have you.

883
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:46,493
Be their hero, Clark. Be their monument.

884
01:22:46,495 --> 01:22:48,495
Be their angel.

885
01:22:48,497 --> 01:22:50,364
Be anything they need you to be.

886
01:22:51,099 --> 01:22:52,800
Or be none of it.

887
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:56,804
You don't owe this world a thing.

888
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,640
You never did.

889
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:05,346
This is Deniros. Transfer available to Kane Avenue.

890
01:23:05,348 --> 01:23:06,814
Please, mind your step.

891
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:39,113
I have to speak to the Senator today.

892
01:23:39,115 --> 01:23:40,681
You cannot see the Senator today.

893
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:42,182
I need to speak to her before the hearing.

894
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:44,118
Do you understand how important this is?

895
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,652
I cannot let you see the Senator.

896
01:23:45,654 --> 01:23:47,454
Please, I need to speak to her.

897
01:23:47,456 --> 01:23:50,357
Please, Madam. I beg of you! Please don't do this!

898
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,859
This is so important!

899
01:23:51,861 --> 01:23:54,395
Come with me. Don't touch me!

900
01:23:54,397 --> 01:23:56,597
Please! I'm sorry. She wouldn't leave.

901
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:01,168
I didn't tell you the truth.

902
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:04,071
C.I. Thinks the desert was a setup.

903
01:24:04,073 --> 01:24:06,240
Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty.

904
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:09,043
The bullet?

905
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:18,886
The metal was developed by a private company.

906
01:24:18,888 --> 01:24:20,187
What company?

907
01:24:20,189 --> 01:24:21,789
LexCorp.

908
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,725
Lex Luthor?

909
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:27,247
He also had private security contractors at the desert compound.

910
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:33,033
Go on record.

911
01:24:33,035 --> 01:24:36,737
Not a chance. It's classified.

912
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:37,938
I happen to like my job.

913
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:39,706
It doesn't make sense.

914
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:41,775
You said that the ambush was arranged to frame Superman,

915
01:24:41,777 --> 01:24:44,111
but how could they know that he'd show up in the...

916
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:52,953
In the middle of the desert. Thank you.

917
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:59,860
The Senate hearing is expected to get underway any minute now.

918
01:24:59,862 --> 01:25:02,096
And of course the big unknown in all of this is

919
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:03,597
will Superman show up?

920
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:04,598
That is what they're really waiting to see.

921
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,899
Mr. Keefe. Mr. Keefe.

922
01:25:05,901 --> 01:25:07,434
Soledad o'Brien, in the Moment.

923
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:08,936
Quick question for you.

924
01:25:08,938 --> 01:25:10,304
You're heading in to meet with the Senators.

925
01:25:10,306 --> 01:25:12,106
What will you tell them?

926
01:25:12,108 --> 01:25:15,042
I've come here to tell them to wake up.

927
01:25:15,044 --> 01:25:17,211
This is flesh and blood.

928
01:25:17,213 --> 01:25:18,645
He has delivered a war here.

929
01:25:18,647 --> 01:25:20,881
And this...

930
01:25:20,883 --> 01:25:22,249
This is what war looks like.

931
01:25:22,251 --> 01:25:24,418
I have nothing.

932
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,787
There are plenty of people, sir, who would say he's their hero.

933
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:28,455
He is not a hero.

934
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:31,458
Grace, can you get Greg up here, please?

935
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,660
Right now.

936
01:25:33,662 --> 01:25:35,729
An anonymous source can verify everything

937
01:25:35,731 --> 01:25:37,464
I told you about what happened in Nairomi.

938
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:40,100
An anonymous source? Run it.

939
01:25:40,102 --> 01:25:42,236
Luthor engineered the desert.

940
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:44,404
It was an ambush for Superman.

941
01:25:44,406 --> 01:25:45,973
Trust your reporter. Think Watergate.

942
01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:48,108
Yeah, and you need to think litigate.

943
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:50,644
If you're wrong, Luthor will sue the paper out of existence.

944
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:51,812
You need proof.

945
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:53,347
No. It needs to run now.

946
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:55,015
Before the hearing.

947
01:25:55,017 --> 01:25:56,517
If Superman knows, it might change what he says.

948
01:25:56,519 --> 01:25:58,785
I am not going to risk the paper

949
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:00,487
so that you can pass notes in class

950
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:01,755
to the man that rescued you.

951
01:26:01,757 --> 01:26:03,323
He paid her?

952
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:06,126
Not only paid her. He threatened her.

953
01:26:06,128 --> 01:26:08,529
Gave her a script to learn.

954
01:26:08,531 --> 01:26:11,298
Her parents are alive back home.

955
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,300
But the girl's got a conscience.

956
01:26:13,302 --> 01:26:16,170
He's been using the committee as his puppet theater. Senator!

957
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:18,338
Hi, you.

958
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,706
Don't go anywhere. I want to talk to you.

959
01:26:19,708 --> 01:26:21,708
Uh, you know what? Mercy, you go in

960
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:23,877
and make sure no one takes my seat.

961
01:26:23,879 --> 01:26:25,145
So what you been up to?

962
01:26:25,147 --> 01:26:26,947
I'm just here to tell my story.

963
01:26:26,949 --> 01:26:28,482
That I was willing to finance a Kryptonian deterrent,

964
01:26:28,484 --> 01:26:30,150
but a certain junior Senator from Kentucky

965
01:26:30,152 --> 01:26:32,219
decided to block it.

966
01:26:32,221 --> 01:26:35,856
Yes, the chair of the committee on Superman is soft on security.

967
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:38,525
Greg, why hasn't he been getting our checks? He is, Mr. Wayne.

968
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:41,195
He gets a check from the victims fund every month.

969
01:26:41,197 --> 01:26:43,697
He returns them.

970
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:45,232
...who lost both his legs

971
01:26:45,234 --> 01:26:47,701
in those horrific events in Metropolis

972
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:49,403
that happened two years ago.

973
01:26:49,405 --> 01:26:50,604
Jesus.

974
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:54,341
Why haven't I seen this?

975
01:26:54,343 --> 01:26:56,376
I'm sorry. I'll get to the bottom of it.

976
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:59,079
And there he is. Superman is here.

977
01:26:59,081 --> 01:27:01,348
He is actually at the United States Capitol.

978
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:03,483
This is really a historic moment.

979
01:27:03,485 --> 01:27:05,819
Now we expect that Superman will give

980
01:27:05,821 --> 01:27:07,888
some kind of a statement to the Senate,

981
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:10,624
to the American people, and, of course, to the world.

982
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:12,893
He's here. He came.

983
01:27:12,895 --> 01:27:15,395
He's above the Capitol. Ah.

984
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:18,065
You are gonna be on the hot seat in there, Junebug.

985
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:19,733
I grew up on a farm.

986
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:22,202
I know how to wrestle a pig.

987
01:27:22,204 --> 01:27:24,404
Do you know the oldest lie in America, Senator?

988
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,307
It's that power can be innocent.

989
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,644
Good luck.

990
01:28:06,547 --> 01:28:08,715
Oh, Miss...

991
01:28:08,717 --> 01:28:10,517
Rudy, she's good to go.

992
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,060
Get out!

993
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:26,166
Get out! Get out! Superman! Superman!

994
01:28:33,274 --> 01:28:35,375
Another one came this morning, Mr. Wayne.

995
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:17,484
Let me say at the outset that I'm grateful to our witness

996
01:29:17,486 --> 01:29:20,354
for coming before us today.

997
01:29:20,356 --> 01:29:23,123
This is how a democracy works.

998
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:25,859
We talk to each other.

999
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:31,365
We act by the consent of the governed, sir.

1000
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:34,701
I have sat here before to say that shadow interventions

1001
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:37,704
will not be tolerated by this committee.

1002
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,239
Neither will lies.

1003
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:44,311
Because today is a day for truth.

1004
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:47,781
Because only by speaking...

1005
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:02,396
Only by working together can we...

1006
01:30:08,503 --> 01:30:09,770
Can we...

1007
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:23,016
Can we create a free, and a...

1008
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,346
Oh, my God!

1009
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,006
We're back at the Nation's Capitol,

1010
01:31:20,008 --> 01:31:21,708
where something is happening.

1011
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:40,927
Excuse me.

1012
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:44,164
Excuse me, officer.

1013
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:46,666
Member of the press. Can you let me in, please?

1014
01:31:54,609 --> 01:31:56,209
Breathe slowly and deeply.

1015
01:31:56,211 --> 01:31:57,911
You're gonna be fine.

1016
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:10,357
Thank you. I'm gonna need a little room to work.

1017
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:13,827
Ma'am, it appears you've suffered a head injury.

1018
01:32:13,829 --> 01:32:16,796
I'm gonna need you to follow my light with your eyes.

1019
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:08,448
Master Wayne.

1020
01:33:11,519 --> 01:33:14,421
Mr. Wayne!

1021
01:33:14,423 --> 01:33:18,625
...in the Senate hearing room where Superman was testifying.

1022
01:33:18,627 --> 01:33:21,528
This is a catastrophic situation at our Nation's Capitol.

1023
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:23,196
We don't have exact numbers yet,

1024
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:25,265
but I can tell you that more than a dozen people

1025
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:26,933
have died in this explosion.

1026
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:28,368
First responders are at the scene.

1027
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:30,770
They are still bringing victims out.

1028
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:34,608
Now initially, Superman was helping bring victims out after the blast

1029
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:36,810
but he seems to have disappeared...

1030
01:33:36,812 --> 01:33:38,645
...raising questions.

1031
01:33:38,647 --> 01:33:41,381
Carrie Birmingham, reporting live from the Nation's Capital.

1032
01:33:41,383 --> 01:33:44,217
Capitol police are now confirming that the blast was caused

1033
01:33:44,219 --> 01:33:46,319
by an explosive device inside the hearing room.

1034
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:14,014
Run that one more time for me.

1035
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:17,083
Can you enhance that? There you go, sir.

1036
01:34:55,956 --> 01:34:58,224
Capitol police are confirming to CNN

1037
01:34:58,226 --> 01:34:59,793
that the suspected bomber is

1038
01:34:59,795 --> 01:35:02,328
Wallace Vernon Keefe. Now these sources...

1039
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:04,364
Clark, it's me again. Can you...

1040
01:35:04,366 --> 01:35:06,533
...could have gotten the explosive device into the hearing

1041
01:35:06,535 --> 01:35:08,902
by concealing them inside his wheelchair.

1042
01:35:08,904 --> 01:35:10,837
As for Superman, he was in the room,

1043
01:35:10,839 --> 01:35:12,338
but obviously failed to stop him.

1044
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:14,808
I didn't see it, Lo.

1045
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:16,876
I was standing right there and I didn't see it.

1046
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:18,545
Clark, there are people behind this.

1047
01:35:18,547 --> 01:35:20,780
I'm afraid I didn't see it because I wasn't looking.

1048
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:26,352
All this time,

1049
01:35:26,354 --> 01:35:28,922
I've been living my life the way my father saw it.

1050
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:31,725
Righting wrongs for a ghost.

1051
01:35:34,528 --> 01:35:36,396
Thinking I'm here to do good.

1052
01:35:40,701 --> 01:35:43,103
Superman was never real.

1053
01:35:43,105 --> 01:35:45,805
Just the dream of a farmer from Kansas.

1054
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:50,910
That farmer's dream is all some people have.

1055
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:52,679
It's all that gives them hope.

1056
01:36:04,058 --> 01:36:05,959
This means something.

1057
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:10,196
It did on my world.

1058
01:36:10,198 --> 01:36:12,165
My world doesn't exist anymore.

1059
01:37:31,278 --> 01:37:33,112
Welcome.

1060
01:37:33,114 --> 01:37:38,685
Analysis reveals ship operating at 37% efficiency.

1061
01:37:38,687 --> 01:37:40,687
Would you like to assume command?

1062
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:43,356
Yes, I would.

1063
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:45,491
Yes, I would.

1064
01:37:45,493 --> 01:37:48,728
Very well. Let's begin.

1065
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:53,700
The Kryptonian archive contains knowledge from 100,000 different worlds.

1066
01:37:53,702 --> 01:37:55,168
Good.

1067
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:56,369
Teach me.

1068
01:40:27,187 --> 01:40:28,688
Alexander Luthor,

1069
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:31,391
your security override has been accepted.

1070
01:40:31,393 --> 01:40:34,193
Genesis chamber ready to analyze genetic sample.

1071
01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:40,800
Acknowledging presence of genetic material.

1072
01:40:40,802 --> 01:40:42,035
Analyzing.

1073
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:48,741
I've identified the host as General Zod of Kandor.

1074
01:41:04,559 --> 01:41:07,226
Acknowledging presence of foreign genetic material.

1075
01:41:07,228 --> 01:41:09,429
Analyzing.

1076
01:41:09,431 --> 01:41:11,798
You flew too close to the sun.

1077
01:41:14,068 --> 01:41:15,968
Now look at you.

1078
01:41:17,237 --> 01:41:20,673
Advising. Action forbidden.

1079
01:41:20,675 --> 01:41:22,742
It has been decreed by the council of Krypton

1080
01:41:22,744 --> 01:41:26,245
that none will ever again give life to a deformity

1081
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:28,281
so hateful to sight and memory.

1082
01:41:28,283 --> 01:41:31,117
The desecration without name.

1083
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:33,486
And where is the council of Krypton?

1084
01:41:34,421 --> 01:41:35,621
Destroyed, sir.

1085
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:38,925
Then proceed.

1086
01:41:38,927 --> 01:41:43,329
Very well. Preparing chrysalis and commencing metamorphosis.

1087
01:41:45,866 --> 01:41:47,600
"And so we are left to wonder

1088
01:41:47,602 --> 01:41:51,070
"if Superman was aware of the threat and did nothing,

1089
01:41:51,072 --> 01:41:54,240
"was he then complicit in the capitol tragedy?"

1090
01:41:54,242 --> 01:41:55,875
Still no Kent?

1091
01:41:55,877 --> 01:41:57,443
"His disappearance raises questions."

1092
01:41:57,445 --> 01:41:59,445
No.

1093
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:01,380
There are still so many unanswered questions.

1094
01:42:01,382 --> 01:42:03,282
Chief among them, whether Superman was involved

1095
01:42:03,284 --> 01:42:05,051
in the planning of this attack.

1096
01:42:05,053 --> 01:42:07,320
I mean, here's an individual who has unlimited power,

1097
01:42:07,322 --> 01:42:10,456
yet did nothing to stop the bomber just a few feet away from him.

1098
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:13,126
It just doesn't add up for investigators.

1099
01:42:13,128 --> 01:42:14,627
Burn him, burn him, burn him.

1100
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:17,196
Burn him, burn him, burn him.

1101
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,555
For twenty American, he didn't see you.

1102
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:44,757
Same for me.

1103
01:42:55,969 --> 01:42:59,172
Now one FBI official familiar with this case

1104
01:42:59,174 --> 01:43:01,340
told me they found quote,

1105
01:43:01,342 --> 01:43:04,777
"a jackpot of bomb-making materials inside Keefe's apartment."

1106
01:43:04,779 --> 01:43:07,113
What they need to determine now is

1107
01:43:07,115 --> 01:43:09,849
whether he had any help in the planning and execution of the bombing.

1108
01:43:09,851 --> 01:43:12,051
And they haven't ruled out the idea

1109
01:43:12,053 --> 01:43:15,154
that Superman was a co-conspirator.

1110
01:43:15,156 --> 01:43:19,859
Now, my sources are telling me they are getting a barrage of anonymous and credible tips

1111
01:43:19,861 --> 01:43:22,295
with all roads in this investigation

1112
01:43:22,297 --> 01:43:24,730
leading to the Kryptonian visitor.

1113
01:44:01,769 --> 01:44:03,903
All right, Lois. You gotta go.

1114
01:44:20,587 --> 01:44:22,488
He didn't know he was gonna die.

1115
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:25,758
He just bought groceries.

1116
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,960
The wheelchair and the bullet from the desert

1117
01:44:27,962 --> 01:44:29,729
were made from the same metal.

1118
01:44:29,731 --> 01:44:31,297
I know. The desert. The hearing.

1119
01:44:31,299 --> 01:44:34,200
Everywhere Superman goes, Luthor wants death.

1120
01:44:34,202 --> 01:44:36,469
But, Luthor goes through all of that trouble...

1121
01:44:36,471 --> 01:44:37,903
Creates a bomb out of a wheelchair,

1122
01:44:37,905 --> 01:44:39,805
and then alters it to reduce the blast?

1123
01:44:39,807 --> 01:44:41,641
What do you mean?

1124
01:44:41,643 --> 01:44:44,277
The inside of the chair was lined with lead.

1125
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:48,414
You couldn't stop it.

1126
01:44:48,416 --> 01:44:50,683
You couldn't see it.

1127
01:45:33,193 --> 01:45:34,593
Something, isn't it?

1128
01:45:36,463 --> 01:45:38,431
We men of Kansas live on a pancake,

1129
01:45:38,433 --> 01:45:40,032
so we come to the mountains.

1130
01:45:41,535 --> 01:45:45,338
All downhill from here, down to the floodplain.

1131
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:47,239
Farm at the bottom of the world.

1132
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:52,211
I remember one season the water came bad.

1133
01:45:52,213 --> 01:45:54,146
I couldn't have been 12.

1134
01:45:54,148 --> 01:45:57,149
Dad had out the shovels and we went at it all night.

1135
01:45:57,151 --> 01:45:59,318
We worked till, I think, I fainted.

1136
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:01,120
But we managed to stop the water.

1137
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:05,391
We saved the farm.

1138
01:46:05,393 --> 01:46:08,594
Your grandma baked me a cake. Said I was a hero.

1139
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,765
Later that day we found out

1140
01:46:14,034 --> 01:46:15,201
we blocked the water all right.

1141
01:46:15,203 --> 01:46:17,703
We sent it upstream.

1142
01:46:17,705 --> 01:46:21,240
The whole lang farm washed away.

1143
01:46:21,242 --> 01:46:24,243
While I ate my hero cake, their horses were drowning.

1144
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:29,882
I used to hear them wailing in my sleep.

1145
01:46:33,253 --> 01:46:35,221
Did the nightmares ever stop?

1146
01:46:37,524 --> 01:46:38,891
Yeah.

1147
01:46:39,893 --> 01:46:41,827
When I met your mother.

1148
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:46,665
She gave me faith that there's good in this world.

1149
01:46:49,069 --> 01:46:51,470
She was my world.

1150
01:46:54,074 --> 01:46:55,674
I miss you, son.

1151
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:02,648
I miss you too, Dad.

1152
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:23,869
You know you can't win this.

1153
01:47:25,772 --> 01:47:27,373
It's suicide.

1154
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:33,179
I'm older now than my father ever was.

1155
01:47:35,482 --> 01:47:39,285
This may be the only thing I do that matters.

1156
01:47:39,287 --> 01:47:43,222
20 years of fighting criminals amounts to nothing?

1157
01:47:43,224 --> 01:47:45,958
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.

1158
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:48,360
Pull one up, another grows in its place.

1159
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:52,631
This is about the future of the world.

1160
01:47:54,401 --> 01:47:56,035
This is my legacy.

1161
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:59,638
My father sat me down right here.

1162
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:01,807
Told me what Wayne manor was built on.

1163
01:48:01,809 --> 01:48:05,311
Railroads, real estates, and oil.

1164
01:48:05,313 --> 01:48:08,981
The first generation made their fortune trading with the French.

1165
01:48:08,983 --> 01:48:10,683
Pelts and skins.

1166
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:16,222
They were hunters.

1167
01:48:32,606 --> 01:48:36,375
So falls the house of Wayne.

1168
01:48:36,377 --> 01:48:38,177
We gotta wait for more evidence,

1169
01:48:38,179 --> 01:48:40,145
but the question still remains,

1170
01:48:40,147 --> 01:48:42,014
where is he?

1171
01:48:42,016 --> 01:48:44,350
If Superman was not involved,

1172
01:48:44,352 --> 01:48:47,720
if he's got nothing to hide, then why hasn't he been seen

1173
01:48:47,722 --> 01:48:49,655
since the day of this tragedy?

1174
01:48:49,657 --> 01:48:51,724
You can't point a finger and...

1175
01:48:51,726 --> 01:48:53,626
I'm not pointing anything, Warren. Look. Ten fingers, see?

1176
01:48:53,628 --> 01:48:55,294
If there is going to be a criminal...

1177
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:25,851
The night is here.

1178
01:50:56,483 --> 01:50:57,549
Excuse me.

1179
01:50:59,753 --> 01:51:00,986
Don't I know...

1180
01:52:04,084 --> 01:52:07,920
Plain Lo in the morning. Lola in slacks.

1181
01:52:09,156 --> 01:52:10,289
Lois Lane.

1182
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:14,526
Mmm. Come see the view.

1183
01:52:14,528 --> 01:52:15,728
Um...

1184
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:16,895
Mmm-mmm.

1185
01:52:16,897 --> 01:52:19,098
Now the secret to the height

1186
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:21,400
is the building material.

1187
01:52:21,402 --> 01:52:24,903
It's light metals which sway a bit in the wind.

1188
01:52:25,905 --> 01:52:26,972
Hmm.

1189
01:52:29,576 --> 01:52:32,911
And you know something about LexCorp metals, don't you, Miss Lane?

1190
01:52:32,913 --> 01:52:34,780
I've proven what you've done.

1191
01:52:34,782 --> 01:52:36,882
Wow, you're feisty.

1192
01:52:36,884 --> 01:52:39,384
Unfortunately, that will blow away.

1193
01:52:39,386 --> 01:52:41,420
Like sand in the desert.

1194
01:52:41,422 --> 01:52:42,554
You're psychotic.

1195
01:52:42,556 --> 01:52:44,022
That is a three-syllable word

1196
01:52:44,024 --> 01:52:46,558
for any thought too big for little minds.

1197
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,361
Hmm. Next category: Circles.

1198
01:52:49,363 --> 01:52:54,133
Round and round and round they go to find Superman.

1199
01:52:54,135 --> 01:52:56,268
Wrong category, boy. No, no, triangles.

1200
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:57,870
Yes, Euclid's triangle inequality.

1201
01:52:57,872 --> 01:53:00,072
The shortest distance between any two points

1202
01:53:00,074 --> 01:53:01,874
is a straight path.

1203
01:53:01,876 --> 01:53:04,810
And I believe the straightest path to Superman

1204
01:53:04,812 --> 01:53:06,311
is a pretty little road...

1205
01:53:06,313 --> 01:53:08,747
Mmm. Called Lois Lane.

1206
01:53:31,271 --> 01:53:32,704
You came back.

1207
01:53:33,573 --> 01:53:34,907
You came back.

1208
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:56,361
Boy, do we have problems up here!

1209
01:54:00,935 --> 01:54:03,335
The problem of... of evil in the world.

1210
01:54:03,337 --> 01:54:05,537
Uh, the problem of absolute virtue.

1211
01:54:05,539 --> 01:54:07,706
I'll take you in without breaking you.

1212
01:54:07,708 --> 01:54:09,508
Which is more than you deserve.

1213
01:54:09,510 --> 01:54:11,977
The problem of you on top of everything else.

1214
01:54:11,979 --> 01:54:13,679
You above all.

1215
01:54:13,681 --> 01:54:16,181
Ah, because that's what God is.

1216
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:20,252
Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El.

1217
01:54:21,187 --> 01:54:24,556
Clark Joseph Kent.

1218
01:54:26,326 --> 01:54:30,529
See, what we call God depends upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.

1219
01:54:30,531 --> 01:54:33,665
Because God is tribal. God takes sides.

1220
01:54:33,667 --> 01:54:35,667
No man in the sky intervened when I was a boy

1221
01:54:35,669 --> 01:54:38,704
to deliver me from Daddy's fist and abominations. Mmm.

1222
01:54:38,706 --> 01:54:42,507
I figured out way back, if God is all-powerful,

1223
01:54:42,509 --> 01:54:43,942
he cannot be all-good.

1224
01:54:45,645 --> 01:54:47,212
And if he is all-good,

1225
01:54:47,214 --> 01:54:49,548
then he cannot be all-powerful.

1226
01:54:49,550 --> 01:54:51,149
And neither can you be.

1227
01:54:52,352 --> 01:54:54,386
They need to see the fraud you are.

1228
01:54:54,988 --> 01:54:56,288
With their eyes.

1229
01:54:57,557 --> 01:55:00,425
The blood on your hands.

1230
01:55:00,427 --> 01:55:01,593
What have you done?

1231
01:55:01,595 --> 01:55:03,495
Hmm. And tonight, they will.

1232
01:55:03,497 --> 01:55:07,666
Yes. Because you, my friend, have a date. Hmm.

1233
01:55:07,668 --> 01:55:09,167
Across the bay.

1234
01:55:09,169 --> 01:55:11,737
Ripe fruit, his hate. Two years growing.

1235
01:55:11,739 --> 01:55:13,772
But it did not take much to push him over, actually.

1236
01:55:13,774 --> 01:55:15,340
Little red notes, big bang.

1237
01:55:15,342 --> 01:55:18,076
You let your family die!

1238
01:55:18,078 --> 01:55:23,782
And now you will fly to him. And you will battle him.

1239
01:55:23,784 --> 01:55:25,350
To the death.

1240
01:55:26,586 --> 01:55:29,621
Black and blue. Fight night!

1241
01:55:29,623 --> 01:55:33,125
The greatest gladiator match in the history of the world.

1242
01:55:33,127 --> 01:55:35,961
God versus man.

1243
01:55:35,963 --> 01:55:38,864
Day versus night.

1244
01:55:38,866 --> 01:55:41,934
Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham.

1245
01:55:41,936 --> 01:55:44,202
You think I'll fight him for you?

1246
01:55:44,204 --> 01:55:46,972
Hmm, yes, I do. I think you will fight-fight-fight

1247
01:55:46,974 --> 01:55:48,941
for that special lady in your life.

1248
01:55:48,943 --> 01:55:51,243
She's safe on the ground. How about you?

1249
01:55:51,245 --> 01:55:54,880
Close, but I am not talking about Lois.

1250
01:55:54,882 --> 01:55:59,284
No. Every boy's special lady is his mother.

1251
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:07,459
Martha, Martha, Martha.

1252
01:56:07,961 --> 01:56:09,428
Hmm.

1253
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:13,398
Why, the mother of a flying demon must be a witch.

1254
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:16,268
The punishment for witches, what is that?

1255
01:56:16,270 --> 01:56:18,403
That's right. Death by fire.

1256
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:22,007
Mmm.

1257
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:30,015
Where is she?

1258
01:56:30,017 --> 01:56:31,817
I don't know! I would not let them tell me!

1259
01:56:31,819 --> 01:56:34,319
Uh-uh-uh! If you kill me, Martha dies.

1260
01:56:34,321 --> 01:56:36,488
And if you fly away, mmm, Martha also dies.

1261
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:39,491
But if you kill the Bat...

1262
01:56:39,493 --> 01:56:40,926
Martha lives.

1263
01:56:45,832 --> 01:56:49,101
There we go. There we go. Hmm.

1264
01:56:51,671 --> 01:56:55,607
And now God bends to my will.

1265
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:04,182
Ooh, now the cameras are waiting at your ship.

1266
01:57:04,184 --> 01:57:06,451
For the world to see the holes in the Holy.

1267
01:57:06,453 --> 01:57:07,953
Yes, the almighty comes clean

1268
01:57:07,955 --> 01:57:09,321
about how dirty he is when it counts.

1269
01:57:09,323 --> 01:57:11,023
To save Martha,

1270
01:57:11,025 --> 01:57:12,691
bring me the head of the Bat.

1271
01:57:16,195 --> 01:57:17,496
Ah.

1272
01:57:17,498 --> 01:57:20,365
Mother of God, would you look at the time?

1273
01:57:20,367 --> 01:57:22,701
When you came here, you had an hour.

1274
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:25,871
Now it's less.

1275
01:58:27,533 --> 01:58:29,234
Brooke Baldwin is on the scene.

1276
01:58:29,236 --> 01:58:31,470
Brooke, you're live on the air. What are you seeing?

1277
01:58:31,472 --> 01:58:33,032
There's something happening at the ship.

1278
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:37,242
It's sending massive power surges.

1279
01:58:37,244 --> 01:58:39,077
Police helicopters surrounding the area.

1280
01:58:39,079 --> 01:58:41,813
They've created a barricade around this containment center.

1281
01:58:41,815 --> 01:58:43,415
And we're trying to get a little bit closer here

1282
01:58:43,417 --> 01:58:45,117
to find out what's going on.

1283
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:47,119
It is absolute chaos. You can see that lightning,

1284
01:58:47,121 --> 01:58:48,787
those surges of electricity.

1285
01:58:48,789 --> 01:58:52,057
They seem to be getting stronger by the minute.

1286
01:58:52,059 --> 01:58:54,793
Daily Planet.

1287
01:58:54,795 --> 01:58:59,164
Lois. I have to go to Gotham to convince him to help me.

1288
01:58:59,166 --> 01:59:00,232
Who?

1289
01:59:02,602 --> 01:59:04,636
Or he has to die.

1290
01:59:04,638 --> 01:59:05,871
Clark.

1291
01:59:09,242 --> 01:59:11,409
No one stays good in this world.

1292
01:59:20,353 --> 01:59:24,356
But as of right now, much of the city remains in the dark tonight.

1293
01:59:24,358 --> 01:59:28,693
Much chaos. Much confusing happening on the streets of Metropolis tonight.

1294
01:59:28,695 --> 01:59:30,862
Those helicopters are still surrounding the area.

1295
01:59:30,864 --> 01:59:33,398
I don't know if you can still see those bolts of lightning...

1296
02:01:35,254 --> 02:01:40,292
2400 hours and 2 minutes. Subject declining rapidly.

1297
02:01:40,294 --> 02:01:42,360
All procedural interventions have failed.

1298
02:01:43,229 --> 02:01:44,796
Outcome

1299
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:48,667
will be death.

1300
02:01:57,343 --> 02:02:00,145
Dr. Silas stone suspending all clinical protocol.

1301
02:02:00,147 --> 02:02:06,885
US gov, object 6-19-82 is successfully activated.

1302
02:02:28,507 --> 02:02:29,808
I need a chopper to Gotham.

1303
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:31,209
Call the heliport.

1304
02:02:31,211 --> 02:02:32,977
Chopper? We can barely afford a bicycle.

1305
02:02:32,979 --> 02:02:34,145
You wanna chase a story?

1306
02:02:34,147 --> 02:02:35,447
Go to the ship.

1307
02:02:35,449 --> 02:02:36,815
Superman's probably there already.

1308
02:02:36,817 --> 02:02:39,584
Perry, it's not for a story.

1309
02:02:44,457 --> 02:02:46,157
Jenny, get her a chopper to Gotham.

1310
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:48,693
And forget the heliport. Put it on the Goddamn roof.

1311
02:02:48,695 --> 02:02:50,195
On the roof, Lois!

1312
02:02:52,865 --> 02:02:54,532
Where are we headed?

1313
02:02:54,534 --> 02:02:55,734
There!

1314
02:03:11,717 --> 02:03:14,753
Well, here I am.

1315
02:03:16,088 --> 02:03:17,455
Bruce. Please.

1316
02:03:19,225 --> 02:03:22,093
I was wrong. You have to listen to me.

1317
02:03:22,095 --> 02:03:23,328
Lex wants us to...

1318
02:03:38,744 --> 02:03:41,079
You don't understand.

1319
02:03:41,081 --> 02:03:42,447
There's no time!

1320
02:03:44,083 --> 02:03:45,250
I understand.

1321
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:03,328
Stay down!

1322
02:05:03,330 --> 02:05:05,763
If I wanted it, you'd be dead already.

1323
02:05:43,836 --> 02:05:45,136
Breathe it in.

1324
02:05:47,907 --> 02:05:49,774
That's fear.

1325
02:05:52,678 --> 02:05:54,112
You're not brave.

1326
02:05:58,417 --> 02:05:59,951
Men are brave.

1327
02:09:49,715 --> 02:09:54,385
I bet your parents taught you that you mean something.

1328
02:09:54,387 --> 02:09:56,053
That you're here for a reason.

1329
02:09:57,556 --> 02:10:01,259
My parents taught me a different lesson,

1330
02:10:01,261 --> 02:10:03,728
dying in the gutter

1331
02:10:03,730 --> 02:10:05,730
for no reason at all.

1332
02:10:22,481 --> 02:10:25,149
They taught me the world only makes sense

1333
02:10:25,151 --> 02:10:27,218
if you force it to.

1334
02:11:05,557 --> 02:11:07,458
You were never a God.

1335
02:11:10,229 --> 02:11:12,396
You were never even a man.

1336
02:11:19,338 --> 02:11:22,707
You're letting him kill Martha.

1337
02:11:28,347 --> 02:11:30,147
What does that mean?

1338
02:11:31,350 --> 02:11:32,917
Why did you say that name?

1339
02:11:34,186 --> 02:11:36,754
Find him.

1340
02:11:37,990 --> 02:11:39,690
Save

1341
02:11:39,692 --> 02:11:41,392
Martha.

1342
02:11:44,329 --> 02:11:45,730
Martha.

1343
02:12:16,528 --> 02:12:18,429
Martha.

1344
02:12:22,634 --> 02:12:23,801
Why did you say that name?

1345
02:12:25,738 --> 02:12:27,571
Martha! Why did you say that name?

1346
02:12:27,573 --> 02:12:28,873
Clark! Stop!

1347
02:12:28,875 --> 02:12:30,241
Please! Stop!

1348
02:12:30,243 --> 02:12:31,909
Why did you say that name?

1349
02:12:31,911 --> 02:12:34,378
It's his mother's name!

1350
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:36,647
It's his mother's name.

1351
02:13:08,247 --> 02:13:09,780
We're not getting any answers.

1352
02:13:09,782 --> 02:13:11,315
We're still right outside the containment center.

1353
02:13:11,317 --> 02:13:12,516
A dangerous situation.

1354
02:13:12,518 --> 02:13:13,951
Military and police personnel

1355
02:13:13,953 --> 02:13:15,519
surrounding the area.

1356
02:13:31,036 --> 02:13:32,303
Luthor.

1357
02:13:32,305 --> 02:13:34,772
He wanted your life for hers.

1358
02:13:35,974 --> 02:13:37,808
She's losing time.

1359
02:13:37,810 --> 02:13:40,711
The scout ship seems to be drawing power from the city.

1360
02:13:40,713 --> 02:13:42,279
It's got to be Lex.

1361
02:13:42,281 --> 02:13:45,016
They need you at that ship. I'll find her.

1362
02:13:45,018 --> 02:13:47,118
My mother needs me. Wait.

1363
02:13:48,220 --> 02:13:50,654
I'll make you a promise.

1364
02:13:50,656 --> 02:13:52,923
Martha won't die tonight.

1365
02:14:19,651 --> 02:14:21,018
Master Wayne.

1366
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:22,253
Alfred.

1367
02:14:22,255 --> 02:14:24,021
Uh, I'm sorry for listening in,

1368
02:14:24,023 --> 02:14:25,556
but I've tracked the Russian's phone

1369
02:14:25,558 --> 02:14:27,224
to a warehouse near the port.

1370
02:14:27,226 --> 02:14:28,759
You're locked onto it.

1371
02:14:28,761 --> 02:14:30,327
I don't deserve you, Alfred.

1372
02:14:30,329 --> 02:14:32,797
No, sir. You don't.

1373
02:14:53,552 --> 02:14:55,486
I'm afraid this is goodbye.

1374
02:14:57,389 --> 02:15:01,592
And every time we say goodbye, you die a little.

1375
02:15:14,739 --> 02:15:16,540
- Take it down. - Go! Go!

1376
02:15:39,898 --> 02:15:41,232
You have to take it, Alfred.

1377
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:43,801
Ah, right.

1378
02:15:43,803 --> 02:15:45,870
Commencing drone mode.

1379
02:15:48,840 --> 02:15:50,674
Thermal imaging is showing me

1380
02:15:50,676 --> 02:15:53,277
two dozen hostiles on the third floor.

1381
02:15:53,279 --> 02:15:55,679
Why don't I drop you off on the second?

1382
02:19:00,765 --> 02:19:02,499
Drop it.

1383
02:19:04,169 --> 02:19:06,070
I said drop it!

1384
02:19:07,038 --> 02:19:08,372
I'll kill her.

1385
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:12,443
Believe me, I'll do it.

1386
02:19:15,313 --> 02:19:16,447
I believe you.

1387
02:19:28,828 --> 02:19:31,862
It's okay. I'm a friend of your son's.

1388
02:19:31,864 --> 02:19:34,765
I figured. The cape.

1389
02:20:02,862 --> 02:20:04,395
"Late, late," says the white rabbit.

1390
02:20:04,397 --> 02:20:06,196
40 seconds to animation.

1391
02:20:06,198 --> 02:20:07,831
Right, wabbit?

1392
02:20:07,833 --> 02:20:11,602
Hmm. Out of tricks, out of time.

1393
02:20:12,670 --> 02:20:15,172
And one Bat head short.

1394
02:20:15,174 --> 02:20:17,007
30 seconds to animation.

1395
02:20:17,009 --> 02:20:18,776
Ah. That'll be the cook.

1396
02:20:18,778 --> 02:20:19,943
Excuse me.

1397
02:20:19,945 --> 02:20:22,880
Uh, Gotham roast. Well done.

1398
02:20:22,882 --> 02:20:25,048
Hello. Break the bad news.

1399
02:20:25,050 --> 02:20:27,951
I'd rather do the breaking in person.

1400
02:20:27,953 --> 02:20:29,686
20 seconds to animation.

1401
02:20:29,688 --> 02:20:30,754
You've lost.

1402
02:20:31,723 --> 02:20:32,956
I don't know how to lose.

1403
02:20:32,958 --> 02:20:34,124
You'll learn.

1404
02:20:34,126 --> 02:20:35,759
I'll learn.

1405
02:20:35,761 --> 02:20:38,262
I don't hate the sinner.

1406
02:20:38,264 --> 02:20:40,364
- I hate the sin. - 10 seconds to animation.

1407
02:20:40,366 --> 02:20:43,033
And yours, my friend, is existing.

1408
02:20:43,868 --> 02:20:45,469
I cannot let you win.

1409
02:20:45,471 --> 02:20:46,737
I gave the bat a fighting chance to do it,

1410
02:20:46,739 --> 02:20:47,805
but he was not strong enough.

1411
02:20:47,807 --> 02:20:49,807
So, if man won't kill God...

1412
02:20:49,809 --> 02:20:51,975
...two, one.

1413
02:20:53,645 --> 02:20:54,745
...the Devil will do it!

1414
02:21:11,464 --> 02:21:12,896
Perry!

1415
02:21:12,898 --> 02:21:15,566
All right. Stay calm, everybody!

1416
02:21:15,568 --> 02:21:17,000
We're getting reports there are total blackouts

1417
02:21:17,002 --> 02:21:19,770
in the north and to the northwest of the city.

1418
02:21:19,772 --> 02:21:21,171
Federal authorities are trying to determine

1419
02:21:21,173 --> 02:21:23,474
if this is part of a larger terrorist attack.

1420
02:21:27,846 --> 02:21:30,948
Ancient Kryptonian deformity.

1421
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:34,685
Hmm. Blood of my blood.

1422
02:21:41,192 --> 02:21:43,360
Born to destroy you.

1423
02:21:46,097 --> 02:21:48,165
Your Doomsday.

1424
02:22:11,289 --> 02:22:14,091
Now God is good

1425
02:22:14,626 --> 02:22:16,093
as dead.

1426
02:22:19,298 --> 02:22:20,597
Oh!

1427
02:23:39,711 --> 02:23:41,111
Potus joining.

1428
02:23:41,113 --> 02:23:42,479
Mr. President.

1429
02:23:42,481 --> 02:23:44,147
What the hell is it, Calvin?

1430
02:23:44,149 --> 02:23:45,816
These are live images from the top

1431
02:23:45,818 --> 02:23:48,051
of the LexCorp tower in downtown Metropolis.

1432
02:23:48,053 --> 02:23:49,886
Military aircraft are on the scene.

1433
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:03,767
Are you hurt, Ma'am? I'm okay.

1434
02:24:03,769 --> 02:24:05,502
Good. You're gonna be all right, okay?

1435
02:24:15,313 --> 02:24:18,181
This thing emerged from the Kryptonian crash site

1436
02:24:18,183 --> 02:24:19,983
just moments ago.

1437
02:24:19,985 --> 02:24:21,985
Thankfully though, the work day is over

1438
02:24:21,987 --> 02:24:24,521
in the downtown core. It's nearly empty.

1439
02:24:24,523 --> 02:24:28,258
Now military aircraft. Those are apache helicopters.

1440
02:24:28,260 --> 02:24:30,761
They have now just arrived. The images that...

1441
02:25:06,998 --> 02:25:10,200
We've, uh... We just lost connection with Metropolis 8 news.

1442
02:25:10,202 --> 02:25:12,536
Now, it's not clear what just happened.

1443
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:17,708
What's happening there, Alfred?

1444
02:25:19,545 --> 02:25:21,511
How best to describe it?

1445
02:25:21,513 --> 02:25:23,413
Metropolis airspace has been closed briefly.

1446
02:25:23,415 --> 02:25:24,981
Excuse me?

1447
02:25:24,983 --> 02:25:25,682
We kindly ask that you stay in your seats.

1448
02:25:25,684 --> 02:25:27,050
Excuse me?

1449
02:25:27,052 --> 02:25:28,452
Miss Prince?

1450
02:25:42,900 --> 02:25:44,901
Sir. Look, they've cleared the city.

1451
02:25:44,903 --> 02:25:46,570
Looks like he's taking it into space.

1452
02:25:46,572 --> 02:25:48,405
We can go straight to key red, Mr. President.

1453
02:25:48,407 --> 02:25:50,040
Not yet. Are you crazy?

1454
02:25:50,042 --> 02:25:51,341
They're high enough that we can nuke 'em

1455
02:25:51,343 --> 02:25:52,709
with no casualties, sir.

1456
02:25:52,711 --> 02:25:55,645
One casualty, Mr. President. Superman.

1457
02:25:58,217 --> 02:25:59,583
God have mercy on us all.

1458
02:26:05,923 --> 02:26:07,958
Key is hot. Key is hot.

1459
02:26:07,960 --> 02:26:09,993
Red birds are armed to deploy, sir.

1460
02:26:11,262 --> 02:26:12,562
Fire at will.

1461
02:26:12,564 --> 02:26:14,598
Three, two, one...

1462
02:27:03,614 --> 02:27:04,915
Oh, God.

1463
02:27:27,138 --> 02:27:28,505
Projectile 1. Impact.

1464
02:27:28,507 --> 02:27:30,540
Stryker's island, east of Metropolis.

1465
02:27:30,542 --> 02:27:31,842
That's uninhabited.

1466
02:27:31,844 --> 02:27:33,376
Projectile 2...

1467
02:27:38,950 --> 02:27:41,151
No apparent reentry.

1468
02:27:41,153 --> 02:27:43,119
Projectile 2?

1469
02:27:43,121 --> 02:27:48,959
Superman, Mr. President. Projectile 2 was Superman.

1470
02:27:48,961 --> 02:27:50,260
Sir.

1471
02:27:50,962 --> 02:27:52,095
It's moving.

1472
02:28:33,537 --> 02:28:35,238
The shockwaves are getting stronger.

1473
02:28:35,240 --> 02:28:38,408
Every time we hit it, we make it more powerful.

1474
02:28:38,410 --> 02:28:41,077
We can't attack.

1475
02:28:41,079 --> 02:28:43,546
What are you saying, Calvin?

1476
02:28:43,548 --> 02:28:45,782
I'm saying it's unkillable.

1477
02:29:13,277 --> 02:29:15,612
Master Wayne, are you receiving me?

1478
02:29:15,614 --> 02:29:16,780
Alfred.

1479
02:29:16,782 --> 02:29:18,615
It's Kryptonian.

1480
02:29:18,617 --> 02:29:21,318
Only kryptonite weapons can kill it.

1481
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:24,487
They might. If you had any left.

1482
02:29:24,489 --> 02:29:27,958
I got one round left.

1483
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:32,128
The spear. Alfred, the spear. It's pure kryptonite.

1484
02:29:32,130 --> 02:29:33,897
It's back in Gotham.

1485
02:29:33,899 --> 02:29:36,766
If I can penetrate the skin, the spear will kill it.

1486
02:29:36,768 --> 02:29:38,435
It would in theory.

1487
02:29:38,437 --> 02:29:40,937
I've gotta get it to chase me back to the city.

1488
02:29:40,939 --> 02:29:42,672
Back to the kryptonite.

1489
02:30:43,334 --> 02:30:44,934
Oh, shit.

1490
02:31:34,352 --> 02:31:36,419
Why did you bring him back to the city?

1491
02:31:36,421 --> 02:31:37,921
The port is abandoned.

1492
02:31:37,923 --> 02:31:39,789
There's a weapon here that can kill it.

1493
02:31:52,369 --> 02:31:53,636
Did you find the spear?

1494
02:31:54,605 --> 02:31:56,372
I've been a little busy.

1495
02:31:56,374 --> 02:31:59,676
This thing, this creature, seems to feed on energy.

1496
02:32:01,745 --> 02:32:04,647
This thing is from another world.

1497
02:32:05,316 --> 02:32:06,649
My world.

1498
02:32:06,651 --> 02:32:09,319
I've killed things from other worlds before.

1499
02:32:10,955 --> 02:32:12,155
Is she with you?

1500
02:32:13,124 --> 02:32:15,024
I thought she was with you.

1501
02:35:53,477 --> 02:35:55,011
Clark!

1502
02:35:55,013 --> 02:35:56,379
Clark!

1503
02:36:03,854 --> 02:36:04,921
Clark!

1504
02:36:15,400 --> 02:36:17,300
Clark!

1505
02:36:17,302 --> 02:36:18,935
Clark! Are you all right?

1506
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:58,474
I love you.

1507
02:37:02,079 --> 02:37:05,515
No. No, Clark, you can't.

1508
02:37:07,251 --> 02:37:09,185
This is my world.

1509
02:37:09,187 --> 02:37:10,653
No, Clark, don't.

1510
02:37:14,258 --> 02:37:16,626
You are my world.

1511
02:37:16,628 --> 02:37:17,760
No.

1512
02:37:20,931 --> 02:37:22,665
Please. Clark!

1513
02:44:28,625 --> 02:44:29,692
Hi.

1514
02:44:36,700 --> 02:44:39,435
Clark had this sent here, so he could surprise you.

1515
02:47:06,516 --> 02:47:08,684
"The dead shall live.

1516
02:47:09,519 --> 02:47:12,755
"My slain shall rise again.

1517
02:47:15,725 --> 02:47:18,594
"Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust.

1518
02:47:20,030 --> 02:47:23,365
"For thy dew is like the dew of morning.

1519
02:47:25,201 --> 02:47:30,139
"And the earth shall give birth to her dead."

1520
02:47:37,547 --> 02:47:40,215
Ah, I need a ride back to the house.

1521
02:47:40,217 --> 02:47:42,918
I forgot my checkbook to pay the funeral director.

1522
02:47:42,920 --> 02:47:45,054
They said it's all taken care of.

1523
02:47:45,056 --> 02:47:46,121
By whom?

1524
02:47:47,057 --> 02:47:48,791
Anonymous donor.

1525
02:48:32,602 --> 02:48:36,772
All those circuses back east burying an empty box.

1526
02:48:36,774 --> 02:48:38,841
They don't know how to honor him,

1527
02:48:39,876 --> 02:48:41,677
except as a soldier.

1528
02:48:43,446 --> 02:48:46,782
I've failed him in life.

1529
02:48:48,251 --> 02:48:52,054
I won't fail him in death.

1530
02:48:52,056 --> 02:48:54,723
Help me find the others like you.

1531
02:48:54,725 --> 02:48:56,658
Perhaps they don't want to be found.

1532
02:48:57,594 --> 02:49:00,395
They will. And they'll fight.

1533
02:49:01,598 --> 02:49:03,565
We have to stand together.

1534
02:49:11,307 --> 02:49:14,543
100 years ago, I walked away from mankind.

1535
02:49:16,613 --> 02:49:18,580
From a century of horrors.

1536
02:49:22,152 --> 02:49:25,854
Man made a world where standing together is impossible.

1537
02:49:28,925 --> 02:49:30,859
Men are still good.

1538
02:49:33,329 --> 02:49:36,231
We fight. We kill.

1539
02:49:37,433 --> 02:49:39,835
We betray one another.

1540
02:49:41,704 --> 02:49:43,772
But we can rebuild.

1541
02:49:45,008 --> 02:49:46,875
We can do better.

1542
02:49:48,144 --> 02:49:50,179
We will.

1543
02:49:50,181 --> 02:49:51,380
We have to.

1544
02:50:14,470 --> 02:50:16,038
The others like me.

1545
02:50:16,040 --> 02:50:18,307
Why did you say they'll have to fight?

1546
02:50:23,713 --> 02:50:25,948
Just a feeling.

1547
02:50:37,160 --> 02:50:39,761
Prisoner A-C-23-19-40.

1548
02:50:39,763 --> 02:50:42,497
The Warden wants to speak to you, so stand to your feet.

1549
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:46,001
I'm gonna say this one more time.

1550
02:50:46,003 --> 02:50:48,804
The Warden wants to speak to you, so stand to your feet.

1551
02:50:56,679 --> 02:50:58,580
Turn around and face the wall.

1552
02:51:00,617 --> 02:51:03,018
Place your forehead against the wall.

1553
02:51:03,020 --> 02:51:04,920
Put your hands behind your back,

1554
02:51:04,922 --> 02:51:06,989
so that I can come in and restrain you.

1555
02:51:35,285 --> 02:51:38,220
Whatever you do, wherever you go,

1556
02:51:38,222 --> 02:51:40,322
I'll be watching you.

1557
02:51:40,957 --> 02:51:42,357
Oh...

1558
02:51:43,793 --> 02:51:45,360
Look at us.

1559
02:51:46,462 --> 02:51:48,764
This is how it all caves in.

1560
02:51:48,766 --> 02:51:54,169
Civilization on the Wayne manor's out the window.

1561
02:51:54,171 --> 02:51:55,737
Mmm?

1562
02:51:58,242 --> 02:52:01,143
But who would believe me? I...

1563
02:52:01,145 --> 02:52:03,578
I'm insane.

1564
02:52:04,847 --> 02:52:07,015
I'm not even fit to stand trial.

1565
02:52:07,017 --> 02:52:08,950
That's right.

1566
02:52:08,952 --> 02:52:12,788
We have hospitals that treat the mentally ill with compassion.

1567
02:52:14,091 --> 02:52:16,091
But that's not where you're going.

1568
02:52:16,093 --> 02:52:19,594
I arranged for you to get transferred to Arkham Asylum in Gotham.

1569
02:52:20,997 --> 02:52:23,532
I still have some friends there.

1570
02:52:23,534 --> 02:52:25,167
They're expecting you.

1571
02:52:29,672 --> 02:52:33,909
But the bell's already been rung.

1572
02:52:36,379 --> 02:52:37,846
And they've heard it.

1573
02:52:39,682 --> 02:52:41,450
Out in the dark.

1574
02:52:41,452 --> 02:52:44,119
Among the stars. Hmm.

1575
02:52:47,190 --> 02:52:50,759
Ding dong, the God is dead.

1576
02:53:00,136 --> 02:53:02,938
But a bell cannot be unrung!

1577
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:07,776
He's hungry. He's found us.

1578
02:53:08,978 --> 02:53:10,746
And he's coming!

1579
02:53:13,883 --> 02:53:16,451
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1580
02:53:18,654 --> 02:53:21,623
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1581
02:53:23,493 --> 02:53:26,795
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1582
02:53:28,097 --> 02:53:31,133
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1583
02:53:33,169 --> 02:53:37,939
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1584
02:53:37,941 --> 02:53:41,109
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
