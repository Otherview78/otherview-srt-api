1
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,035
Get in there now!

2
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,996
Get in! Get in!

3
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:49,123
Get in there, Dude!

4
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,958
Get in now!

5
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:52,746
Come on!

6
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:57,298
All right!

7
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,689
Got room for one more?

8
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,191
Who the hell are you?!

9
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,069
And what happened to them?

10
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:23,490
Name's Major Marquis Warren,
former U.S. Cavalry.

11
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:27,912
Currently a servant of the court.
Trying to bring a couple no-goods into market.

12
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,039
Got the paperwork on 'em in my pocket.

13
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:32,291
You takin' 'em into Red Rock?

14
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,628
- Figure that's where you headed, right?
- I am.

15
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:39,550
That damn blasted blizzard
has been on our ass for the last three hours.

16
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,022
There ain't no way we gonna make it
all the way to Red Rock 'fore it catches us.

17
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:47,389
So you hightailin' it halfway,
to Minnie's Haberdashery?

18
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,516
You know I am.

19
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:53,020
- May I come aboard?
- Well, smoke,

20
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:56,190
if it up to me, yes.

21
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,275
But it ain't up to me.

22
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,027
Who's it up to?

23
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,862
Fella in the wagon.

24
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,406
Fella in the wagon
ain't partial to company?

25
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:08,410
Fella in the wagon, he paid for a private trip,
and I'm here to tell you,

26
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,371
he paid a pretty penny for privacy.

27
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:13,290
So if you want to go to Minnie's with us,

28
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,626
you gonna have to talk to him.

29
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:18,212
Well...

30
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,673
that's what I'll do.

31
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,219
Hold it, black fella.

32
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:28,681
'Fore you approach,
you take them two guns of yours

33
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:32,059
and you lay 'em on that rock
over yonder.

34
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:36,647
Then you raise both your hands
way above your hat.

35
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,941
Then you approach.

36
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,526
Molasses-like.

37
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,696
Real trustin' fella?

38
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:45,698
Not so much.

39
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:00,212
Put 'em down.

40
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,681
Come on ahead.

41
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:14,226
I said way above your hat,
goddamn it!

42
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:18,230
Now come forward.

43
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,191
That's far enough.

44
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:28,031
Well, I'll be dogged.

45
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,950
You a black fella I know.

46
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,369
Colonel somethin'-or-other Warren, right?

47
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,414
Major Marquis Warren.

48
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,291
I know you, too.

49
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,376
We shared a steak dinner

50
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,462
once upon a time in Chattanooga.

51
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,380
You John Ruth The Hangman.

52
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:44,965
That'd be me.

53
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,801
- How long's that been?
- Since that steak?

54
00:07:49,438 --> 00:07:51,054
Eight months.

55
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:53,640
So why don't you explain to me

56
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,851
what a African bounty hunter's doin'

57
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:59,146
wanderin' around in the snow
in the middle of Wyoming?

58
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,190
Trying to get a couple of bounties
in to Red Rock.

59
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:04,068
- So you still in business?
- You know I am.

60
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:05,986
Happened to your horse?

61
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,364
Circumstances caused us
to have to take the long way round.

62
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,408
My horse couldn't make it.

63
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,952
You don't know nothin'
'bout this filly here.

64
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,496
Nope.

65
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,873
- Don't even know her name?
- Nope.

66
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,710
Well, I guess that makes this
one fortuitous wagon.

67
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,754
I sure as hell hope so.

68
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:27,508
Major Marquis Warren,
this here's Daisy Domergue.

69
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,845
Domergue, to you this is Major Warren.

70
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,514
Howdy, nigger.

71
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,975
She's a pepper, ain't she?

72
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,229
Now, girl, don't you know the darkies
don't like being called niggers no more?

73
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:43,232
- They find it offensive.
- I been called worse.

74
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,235
Now, that I can believe.
You never heard of her?

75
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:47,694
Should I?

76
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:51,365
Well, she ain't no John Wilkes Booth,
but maybe you might heard tell

77
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,325
about the price on her head.

78
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,202
- How much?
- $10,000.

79
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,912
Damn.

80
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,373
What'd she do, kill Lily Langtry?

81
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,083
Not quite.

82
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,086
That ten thousand's
practically in my pocket.

83
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:07,589
It's why I ain't too anxious
to be handin' out rides,

84
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,133
especially to professionals
open for business.

85
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:14,722
I can certainly appreciate that.
But I ain't got no designs on her.

86
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,474
One of my fellas over there
is worth $4,000,

87
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,644
another one's worth $3,000,
and one of 'em's worth $1,000.

88
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:23,144
That's damn sure good enough for me.

89
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:29,778
Well... let me see their paperwork.
Like I said, molasses-like.

90
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:39,958
Back off.

91
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,611
Look, I sure hate to interrupt you all,

92
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:14,364
but we got a cold damn blizzard
that's hot on our ass

93
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,283
that we're tryin' to beat to shelter!

94
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,580
I realize that! Now, shut your mouth
and hold them damn horses while I think!

95
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,668
Okay, boy, we'll give it a try.

96
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:30,047
But you leave them two pistols
over yonder with the driver.

97
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,846
Hey, you ain't really gonna let that nigger
ride in here, is ya?

98
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,145
I mean, maybe up there with O.B., but...

99
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,809
How ya like
the sound of them bells, bitch?

100
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,647
They real pretty, ain't they?

101
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:49,567
You open up your trashy mouth again,
I'll knock out them front teeth for ya.

102
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,693
You got it?

103
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,570
Yeah.

104
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,864
Let me hear ya say, "I got it."

105
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:00,369
I got it.

106
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:03,747
I'm gonna need a hand
tyin' these fellas up on the roof.

107
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:07,634
Give O.B. $50 when we get to Red Rock.
He'll help ya.

108
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,921
Well, I agree with O.B.
This storm got me concerned.

109
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,215
We get goin' a lot quicker
you helped out, too.

110
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:16,259
Goddamn it to hell,
I'm already regrettin' this.

111
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:20,848
Now, I can't likely help you tie fellas
to the roof with my wrist cuffed to hers.

112
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:24,894
And my wrist is gonna stay cuffed to hers,
and she ain't never gonna leave my goddamn side

113
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,854
till I personally put her
in the Red Rock jail!

114
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,606
Now, do you got that?!

115
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,358
Yeah, I got it.

116
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,985
Good.

117
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,155
Get in, Dude!

118
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,699
Hut! Get in!

119
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,576
Go on! Hut!

120
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,036
Come on!

121
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,790
Dude, Coconut, giddyup.

122
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,237
Hut!

123
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,952
Giddyup!

124
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,581
Cimarron! Leche! Get in!

125
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,666
So, what happened to your horse?

126
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,293
Get in!

127
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,170
He was kinda old.

128
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:35,964
I done had him for a bit.

129
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,133
When the weather
took a turn for the worse,

130
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,261
well, he done what he could,
but he couldn't make it.

131
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,680
- Get in!
- That's too bad.

132
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,016
Yeah, it is.

133
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:49,186
Me and ol' Lash done rode
a lot of miles together.

134
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,229
Could say he was my best friend,

135
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,442
if I considered stupid animals friends,
which I don't.

136
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,070
Nevertheless, I'm gonna miss him.

137
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,698
Leche!

138
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,992
Who's this Daisy Domergue?

139
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,787
A no damn good murdering bitch,
that's who.

140
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,497
Come on, boys! Get up!

141
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:11,709
I see you ain't got mixed emotions
about bringing a woman to a rope.

142
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,669
By "woman," you mean her?

143
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,297
No, I do not have mixed emotions.

144
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,715
Get in!

145
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:22,344
- So you taking her into Red Rock to hang.
- You bet.

146
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,306
- You gonna wait round to watch it?
- You know I am.

147
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,557
- Come on!
- I want to hear her neck snap

148
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,017
with my own two ears.

149
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,852
Get up, boys!

150
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,396
- You never wait to watch 'em hang?
- Get up!

151
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,482
My bounties never hang,

152
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,859
'cause I never bring 'em in alive.

153
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,278
- Never?
- Never ever.

154
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,872
- Get up!
- We talked about this in Chattanooga.

155
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,993
Bringing desperate men in alive's
a good way to get yourself dead.

156
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,994
- Get in there!
- Can't catch me sleeping

157
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:49,412
if I don't close my eyes.

158
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,875
- I don't want to work that hard.
- No one said the job is supposed to be easy.

159
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,043
No one said
it's supposed to be that hard, neither.

160
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,046
- Get up, boys!
- But that, little lady,

161
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,048
is why they call him "The Hangman."

162
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,717
When the handbill says "dead or alive,"

163
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:06,347
the rest of us shoot ya in the back
from up on top of a perch somewhere,

164
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,223
- bring ya in dead over a saddle.
- Get in!

165
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,018
But when John Ruth The Hangman
catches ya,

166
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,440
you don't die from no bullet in the back.

167
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,775
When The Hangman catches you,
you hang.

168
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,030
You overrate him, nigger.

169
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,784
I give ya he got guts,
but in the brains department,

170
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:31,747
he like a man
who took a high dive in a low well.

171
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,377
Now, Daisy,

172
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,214
I want us to work out
a signal system of communication.

173
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:46,595
When I elbow you real hard in the face,
that means "shut up."

174
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,180
You got it?

175
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,057
I got it.

176
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:55,020
Get in there!

177
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,067
Come on now, boys, get in!

178
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,828
<i>Hey, little apple blossom</i>

179
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:16,750
<i>What seems to be the problem?</i>

180
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,170
<i>All the ones you tell your troubles to</i>

181
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:24,341
<i>They don't really care for you</i>

182
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:27,636
<i>Come and tell me what you're thinking</i>

183
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:32,224
<i>'Cause just when the boat is sinking</i>

184
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:35,644
<i>A little light is blinking</i>

185
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:39,773
<i>And I will come and rescue you</i>

186
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,526
<i>Lots of girls walk around in tears</i>

187
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:47,280
<i>But that's not for you</i>

188
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,116
<i>You've been looking all around for years</i>

189
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:54,329
<i>For someone to tell your troubles to</i>

190
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:58,333
<i>Come and sit with me and talk a while</i>

191
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,295
<i>Let me see your pretty little smile</i>

192
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,382
<i>Put your troubles in a little pile</i>

193
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:09,177
<i>And I will sort them out for you, all right.</i>

194
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,854
Get in!

195
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:21,774
Get in there!

196
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,199
Giddyup!

197
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,664
I... I know we only met each other
the once before,

198
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,251
- and I don't mean to unduly imply intimacy,
- Get up!

199
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:45,088
But, well...

200
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,215
You still got it?

201
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,094
- Do I still got what?
- Get in, now!

202
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,345
The Lincoln letter.

203
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,097
Course.

204
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,516
Get up, boys!

205
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,184
Got it on ya?

206
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,271
- Come on!
- Where?

207
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,105
Right here.

208
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,857
Come on, boys! Get up!

209
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,192
Look, I know you got to be
real careful with it and all,

210
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,029
and I can imagine
you probably don't like taking it

211
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,619
in and out of the envelope
all that often, but...

212
00:17:11,786 --> 00:17:12,991
Get up!

213
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:16,995
If you wouldn't mind,
I'd sure appreciate seeing that again.

214
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,580
Get in, boys!

215
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,833
Giddyup!

216
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,209
You're right.

217
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,462
I don't like taking it in and out

218
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,714
- of the envelope that much.
- I... Yeah.

219
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,215
- But...
- Get in!

220
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:32,218
Seeing's how you saved my life and all...

221
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,429
I suppose I could let you read it again.

222
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,598
Get in!

223
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,267
Get in there!

224
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,438
Get up now!

225
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,737
Get in!

226
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,280
Giddyup!

227
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:00,664
Get in, now!

228
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,628
Get in!

229
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:21,435
"Ole Mary Todd's calling,
so I guess it must be time for bed."

230
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,355
Ole Mary Todd.

231
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,276
Get in!

232
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,654
- Well, that...
- Get up, boys!

233
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,285
That gets me.

234
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,991
Yeah, it gets me, too.

235
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,952
Get in! Get in!

236
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,122
You know what this is, tramp?

237
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,499
It's a letter from Lincoln.

238
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,085
- Letter from Lincoln to him.
- Get in there!

239
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,503
Yeah.

240
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,091
They shared a correspondence
during the war. They was pen pals.

241
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:55,093
- And this is just one of the letters.
- Get up!

242
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,514
What the...

243
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,683
O.B.!

244
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,227
Stop!

245
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,731
Easy.

246
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:13,069
All the stupid...

247
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,697
Like to rip my goddamn arm off!

248
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,775
I didn't drag her stinking ass
up this goddamn mountain

249
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,195
just for you to break her neck
on the outskirts of town!

250
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,906
You the one handed her
my goddamn letter!

251
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:01,660
I didn't give it to her, I give it to you!

252
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,997
That nigger like to bust my jaw.

253
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:12,546
You ruin that letter of his,
that nigger gonna stomp your ass to death.

254
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,882
And when he do,
I'm gonna sit back on that wagon wheel,

255
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,553
watch and laugh!

256
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,053
How is it?

257
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,013
Well, she ain't help it none.

258
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,973
But it's all right.

259
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,810
Is that the way
niggers treat their ladies?

260
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,438
You ain't no goddamn lady!

261
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,988
Hey, Mr. Ruth!

262
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,698
What?

263
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,076
There's another fella on foot
up here on the road.

264
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,453
Hey!

265
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,413
What?!

266
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:52,544
I said there's another fella on foot,
up here on the road.

267
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:12,480
Hey! Hey!

268
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:15,358
Considering there's a blizzard going on,

269
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,696
whole lot of fellas walking around,
wouldn't you say, Major?

270
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:23,033
Well, seeing as how I'm half of them fellas,
yeah, seems to be a lot of us.

271
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:26,995
This changes things, son.

272
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:30,623
$8,000 a lot of money for a nigger.

273
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,875
With a partner, 18's a whole lot better.

274
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:36,462
You really think
I'm in cahoots with that fella, or her?!

275
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,341
- Put them on.
- I-I ain't wearing no handcuffs.

276
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,384
You put those on, or you can stop

277
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,845
worrying about this whole thing
right now!

278
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,598
Hey!

279
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,904
Hey!

280
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,078
Hand your weapons to the driver.

281
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,080
Little jumpy, ain't you?

282
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,083
Never mind the jokes. Just do it.

283
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,796
- If you say so.
- I do.

284
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,527
Okay.

285
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:44,907
- I done done it.
- O.B., you got 'em?

286
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:47,910
- I got 'em.
- Okay, fella.

287
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:50,411
You keep holding that lantern
in that one hand,

288
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:53,665
and you keep that other hand
where I can see it.

289
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,543
Walk over there
where I can get a good look at ya.

290
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:12,475
Well, I'll be a goddamn dog in a manger.

291
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:15,353
Is that you, Chris Mannix?

292
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,482
- I'm sorry, friend, do we know each other?
- Not quite.

293
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:22,152
- You know this fella?
- Only by reputation.

294
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:26,280
Like I said, friend,
you got me at a bit of a disadvantage.

295
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:30,077
Keeping you at a disadvantage
is an advantage I intend to keep.

296
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:33,204
Whoever you are, mister,
you sure sound tough

297
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,416
when you talking to a desperate man
knee-deep in snow.

298
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,001
I-I... I don't want no trouble.

299
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:42,590
I just want a ride.
I-I'm freezing to death!

300
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,215
Who is this joker?

301
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:48,928
You heard of the rebel renegade
Erskine Mannix?

302
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,013
- Mannix's Marauders?
- That's them.

303
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:54,183
Scourge of South Carolina,
Mannix's Marauders.

304
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,602
It's Erskine's youngest boy, Chris.

305
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,980
Brings you in my path, Chris Mannix?

306
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:02,483
Well, Mr. Face, I was riding to Red Rock,

307
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,986
my horse stepped in
a gopher hole in the snow,

308
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,405
fucked up his leg, had to put 'er down.

309
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:08,990
You got business in Red Rock?

310
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:10,616
- Yes, I do.
- What?

311
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:12,326
I'm the new sheriff.

312
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:13,953
Horseshit.

313
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,955
- 'Fraid not.
- Where's your star?

314
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,707
Well, I ain't the sheriff yet.

315
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:21,378
Now, once I get there, they swear me in.
But that ain't happened yet.

316
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,004
And-and that's when you get your star.

317
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,298
You got anything
that can back any of this up?

318
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,633
Yeah. When we get to Red Rock.

319
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,720
And-and from the look
of those three frozen fuckers up there,

320
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:33,389
I-I figure you a bounty hunter
open for business.

321
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:37,520
And-and I figure you taking them
three dead bodies into Red Rock to get paid?

322
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,855
Three dead. One alive.

323
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:43,651
- Who's that?
- Daisy Domergue.

324
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,818
Who the fuck is Daisy Domergue?

325
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:49,447
Not a goddamn thing to nobody,
except me and the hangman.

326
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:51,075
The hangman?

327
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:56,704
Well, I'll be double-dog damned.

328
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,331
You're "The Hangman" Bob Ruth!

329
00:24:58,498 --> 00:24:59,582
It's John.

330
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:01,918
And you!

331
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:03,711
You're the nigger with the head!

332
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,838
Major Marquis!

333
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,090
My Lord, is that really the real head

334
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,468
of Major Marquis looking at me now?

335
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,054
Yeah, it's really me,
and it's really my head.

336
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:14,847
So what's going on?

337
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:18,269
Y'all having a bounty hunters' picnic?
Never mind.

338
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:22,106
You taking them three dead bodies and-and
hurrying to Red Rock to get paid, ain't you?

339
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,439
Yeah.

340
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:28,696
Well, the man in Red Rock's
supposed to pay you is me, the new sheriff.

341
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,571
So if y'all want to get paid,

342
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,698
y'all need to get me to Red Rock.

343
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:34,700
Well, excuse me
for finding it hard to believe

344
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:38,371
a town electing you to do
anything except drop dead.

345
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:42,459
So I'm supposed to freeze to death
'cause you find something hard to believe?

346
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,131
No, I suppose not.

347
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,929
Put them on and come inside.

348
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,771
No.

349
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,818
Then you'll freeze.

350
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:10,570
Then you'll hang.

351
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,738
How so?

352
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:16,951
Stagecoach driver,
could you come down here and join us?

353
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:20,789
I got to hold these horses.
I can hear you just fine from up here.

354
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:26,128
Well, you just heard me tell this fella
I'm the new sheriff of Red Rock, right?

355
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:29,757
- Yeah.
- Red Rock is my town now.

356
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:32,300
And I'm gonna enter my town
in bounty hunter's chains?

357
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:33,759
No, sir!

358
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:37,515
Sorry, bushwhackers,
I ain't entering Red Rock that way.

359
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,390
Now, when you finally get to Red Rock,

360
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:42,393
you gonna realize
every goddamn thing I said was right.

361
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,812
And I expect you, O.B.,

362
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,315
to tell the townsfolk of Red Rock

363
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:50,276
that John Ruth
let their new sheriff freeze to death.

364
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:55,533
Ain't no bounty on my head, bushwhacker.
You let me die, that's murder.

365
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,625
Hold out your hands.

366
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,170
O.B.!

367
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:11,297
Give the major back his iron.

368
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,717
One thing I know for sure,

369
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:16,552
this nigger-hating son of a gun

370
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,804
ain't partnered up with you.

371
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:22,016
Now, I'll help you protect your 8,000,

372
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,185
you help me protect my ten.

373
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:26,020
Deal?

374
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,398
Well, ain't love grand?

375
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,824
Y'all want to lie on the ground
and make snow angels together?

376
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,448
Come on!

377
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:46,208
- Well, I'll tell you what, Bob.
- The name's John.

378
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:49,713
When we get to Red Rock, I'll buy you
and Major Marquis there dinner and booze.

379
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:51,003
Get in!

380
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,884
- My way of saying thanks.
- I don't drink with rebel renegades,

381
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,468
and I damn sure
don't break bread with them.

382
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,637
- Well, Mr. Ruth...
- Get up, boys!

383
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:02,850
You sound like you got a axe
to grind against the Cause.

384
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:05,893
- "The Cause" of a renegade army?
- Get in!

385
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,062
Bunch of losers gone loco.

386
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:09,897
- You bet I do.
- Get up there!

387
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:13,194
You wrapped yourselves up in a rebel flag
as an excuse to kill and steal.

388
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,695
And this ought to interest you, Warren.

389
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:18,197
Imparticular, emancipated blacks.

390
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,117
Sounds like my kind of fella.

391
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,995
Sound to me you been reading

392
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:27,915
a lot of newspapers
printed in Washington, D.C.

393
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:31,002
- Get in!
- Anywho, I'm just trying

394
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:33,212
to let y'all know how grateful I am.

395
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:36,383
I was a goner. And y'all saved me.

396
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,801
You want to show me
how grateful you are?

397
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,720
- Get in there!
- Shut up.

398
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:46,477
Goddamn it, Daisy. It's coming.

399
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,230
- Get in there, Cimarron!
- Here.

400
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:53,150
- Last piece.
- Get in!

401
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:55,610
Get in, now!

402
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,781
Does he know...

403
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,535
Does he know
how famous you once was?

404
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:07,581
- I don't think so.
- Giddyup!

405
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,373
Black Eye.

406
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,460
- Do you know who he is?
- Get in!

407
00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:15,046
Do I know about the $30,000 reward

408
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:17,506
the Confederacy put
on the head of Major Marquis?

409
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,216
Come on now, boys!

410
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:20,760
- Get in!
- Yeah.

411
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:23,056
- Them hillbillies went nigger head-hunting.
- Get in!

412
00:29:23,223 --> 00:29:25,724
They just never did get 'em
the right nigger head, did they?

413
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,767
No, they didn't.

414
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,980
- But it wasn't for lack of trying.
- Get in, boys! Get on!

415
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,855
Them peckerwoods
left their homes and families,

416
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:35,816
and come up this snowy mountain
looking for me and fortune.

417
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,735
Get up!

418
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:39,445
Ain't none of 'em found fortune.

419
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:42,490
The ones
you ain't never heard of no more,

420
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:44,366
they found me.

421
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:46,702
Now, it didn't stay $30,000
the length of the war.

422
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:49,665
Once passions cooled,
it dropped down to eight, then five.

423
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:50,956
Get up, boys!

424
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:53,209
But I bet even when it was 5,000,

425
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:55,961
you had your share
of country boys coming to call.

426
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:59,215
You know I did.

427
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,967
Why'd they have a reward on you?

428
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:04,512
Confederates took exception
to my capacity for killing 'em.

429
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,013
Get up, now!

430
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,224
And after I broke out of Wellenbeck,

431
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:11,648
well, the South took my continued existence
as a personal affront.

432
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:12,978
Get up!

433
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:15,981
And the Cause put a reward on my head.

434
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:19,778
- Get in there!
- What's Wellenbeck?

435
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:22,907
You ain't never heard of Wellenbeck
prisoner of war camp, West Virginia?

436
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:24,865
No, reb, I ain't never heard of it.

437
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,868
Did you bust out?

438
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:31,747
Major Marquis did more than bust out.

439
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:33,582
Major Marquis had a bright idea.

440
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:34,792
Get in, now!

441
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,211
So bright, you got to wonder

442
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:39,714
why nobody never thought about it before.

443
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:43,259
Tell John Ruth your bright idea.

444
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:48,891
Well, the whole damn place
was just made out of kindling.

445
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,516
Get in!

446
00:30:50,794 --> 00:30:52,508
So I burnt it down.

447
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,564
Get in!

448
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:01,944
There was a rookie regiment
spending overnight in the camp.

449
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:05,114
47 men burnt to a crisp.

450
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:08,284
- Southern youth, farmers' sons,
- Get up!

451
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:11,247
- Cream of the crop.
- And I say, "Let 'em burn."

452
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:14,832
I'm supposed to apologize
for killing Johnny Reb?

453
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:17,668
You joined the war
to keep niggers in chains.

454
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,090
I joined the war
to kill white Southern crackers.

455
00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:21,380
Get up!

456
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,549
And that means killing 'em any way I can.

457
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,801
- Get in!
- Shoot 'em, stab 'em,

458
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:27,761
drown 'em, burn 'em,

459
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:30,222
drop a big ol' rock on their head.

460
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,604
Whatever it took to put
white Southern crackers in the ground.

461
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:33,809
Get up!

462
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:37,064
That's what I joined the war to do.
And that's what I did.

463
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,231
To answer your question, John Ruth,

464
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:43,235
when Major Marquis burned 47 men alive,

465
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,155
for no more reason
than to give a nigger a run for the trees,

466
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:49,493
that's when the South put a reward
on the head of Major Marquis.

467
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:51,368
- And I made them trees, Mannix.
- Get in!

468
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:55,082
You best believe I ain't looked back
till I crossed the Northern line.

469
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:59,128
But you had a surprise waiting for you
on the Northern side, didn't you?

470
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:03,632
See, once they started pulling out
all them burnt bodies at Wellenbeck,

471
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:06,091
seems not all them boys were rebs.

472
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:09,136
Why, you burn up
some of your own boys,

473
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,596
didn't you, Major?

474
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:13,098
How many burnt prisoners
they end up finding?

475
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:17,605
Wasn't the final Yankee death count
something like 37?

476
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,104
Giddyup!

477
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:22,484
That's the thing about war, Mannix.
People die.

478
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:27,112
So you gonna chalk it up to "war is hell"?

479
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,657
Well, admittedly,
that is a hard argument to argue with.

480
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:31,659
But if memory serves,

481
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:35,120
your side didn't look at it that way.

482
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:37,665
I think they thought 37 white men

483
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:40,125
for one nigger

484
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:42,419
wasn't so hot a trade.

485
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:45,798
- I do believe they accused you
- Giddyup!

486
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:49,428
Of being a kill-crazy nigger
who only joined the war to kill white folks,

487
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,348
and the whole blue and gray of it all
really didn't matter that much to you.

488
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:53,889
Get up!

489
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,016
And that's why
they drummed your black ass

490
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,519
out of the cavalry
with a yellow stripe down your back.

491
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,814
- Get in!
- Isn't it, Major?

492
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,274
Horseshit!

493
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:05,152
If he'd have did all that,
the cavalry would've shot him.

494
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,988
- Get in!
- Well, I didn't say they could prove it.

495
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:09,194
Get up!

496
00:33:09,361 --> 00:33:11,490
But they sure did think it out loud,
didn't they, Major?

497
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,450
Get up, boys!

498
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:16,203
But Warren's war record was stellar,

499
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,748
and that's what saved his ass.

500
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:21,875
Now, you killed yourself your share

501
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:26,297
of redskins in your day,
didn't you, Black Major?

502
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:28,424
Cavalry tends to look kindly on that.

503
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:31,427
I'll tell you what the cavalry
didn't look kindly on.

504
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,641
- Giddyup!
- Mannix's Marauders, that's what.

505
00:33:33,808 --> 00:33:34,847
Get in!

506
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:39,061
And the fact that Erskine Mannix's little boy
would talk about anybody else's behavior

507
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:42,605
during war time
makes me want to horse-laugh.

508
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:47,192
Don't you say anything about my daddy.

509
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,696
- What he fought for was dignity in defeat,
- Get up there!

510
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:53,115
And against the unconditional surrender.

511
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:56,702
We weren't foreign barbarians
pounding on the city walls.

512
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,829
We were your brothers.

513
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:00,289
Get up, now!

514
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:02,207
We deserved dignity in defeat.

515
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:05,085
Just how many nigger towns did y'all sack

516
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,629
in your fight for dignity in defeat?

517
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:10,049
Ny fair share, Black Major.

518
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:12,760
'Cause when niggers are scared,

519
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:14,804
That's when white folks are safe.

520
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,391
You gonna talk that hateful nigger talk,

521
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,728
you can ride up top with O.B.

522
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,063
No.

523
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,731
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

524
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:28,317
You done got me talking politics.

525
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,569
I didn't want to.

526
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:33,739
Like I said, y'all,
I'm just happy to be alive.

527
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,908
Get in, now!

528
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:37,910
Get up!

529
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:41,121
I think I'll scoot over here
right by this window,

530
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:45,751
and let this beautiful carriage
rock me to sleep.

531
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,712
And dream about how lucky I am.

532
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:54,385
Get up, now!

533
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:46,311
Get in!

534
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:49,108
Get in there! Get in!

535
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:52,319
Get in there! Get in!

536
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:54,194
Get in there, Leche!

537
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,113
Get in there!

538
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,366
Easy.

539
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,684
What the hell is going on?

540
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,729
We weren't expecting
another stage tonight!

541
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:32,900
Yeah, I can see
you already got another one up in here.

542
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:35,652
Just got through putting the horses away.

543
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,488
Well, this ain't the normal line,

544
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:40,491
but we are stuck
on the wrong side of a blizzard,

545
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:42,868
so it looks like you're stuck with us.

546
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,953
Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?

547
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,580
They ain't here.

548
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,999
I'm running the place while they're gone.

549
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:52,669
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?

550
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,630
He says they ain't here.

551
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:56,965
He's looking after the place
while they're gone.

552
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,510
Who are you?

553
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:03,015
I'm Bob.

554
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,269
Well, whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.

555
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,396
Come on.

556
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:14,525
Get 'em out of this cold
'fore that blizzard hits us.

557
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:17,152
You all right?

558
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,573
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Esperate, esperate, esperate!

559
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,074
I just put those other horses away.

560
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:25,244
You need it done fast,
you need to help.

561
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:27,913
I got two of my best men on it.

562
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,416
You heard him, freeloaders.

563
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,669
Get to work!

564
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:36,296
All right, you two, unhook the leaders.

565
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:39,426
- Come on, let's go.
- Open up!

566
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:41,051
- You have to kick it open!
- Ya got to kick it open!

567
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:43,639
- What?
- Kick it open!

568
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:45,556
Shut that door.

569
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:48,352
- There's a goddamn blizzard out there!
- You have to stop, close the door!

570
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:52,606
- You got to nail it shut.
- You have to, you have to nail it shut!

571
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,106
Hold it shut!

572
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:57,444
- There's a hammer and nails by the door!
- You have to nail it shut!

573
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,654
There's a hammer and nails by the door.

574
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:02,698
- Give me a hammer.
- Yeah.

575
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:13,166
You need,
you need two pieces of wood!

576
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:15,002
You need two pieces of wood!
One ain't good enough!

577
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:18,841
- Two pieces of wood!
- The fuckin' thing is busted!

578
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:21,675
Not just one piece of wood!

579
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:25,264
- Give me another piece of wood.
- Yeah. All right.

580
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,352
- I need a nail.
- Here.

581
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:45,908
Jesus.

582
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,996
That door's a son of a gun.

583
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:55,002
Who's the idiot who broke that,
that Mexican fella?

584
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,922
Good heavens. A woman?

585
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:02,718
Out in this white hell?
You must be frozen solid, poor thing.

586
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:07,137
Looks like Minnie's got her a full house.

587
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:11,558
When did you fellas arrive?

588
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,728
About 40 minutes ago.

589
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:17,445
That cowboy fella in the corner,
that your driver?

590
00:39:17,612 --> 00:39:20,694
No, no, he's a passenger.
The driver lit out.

591
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,823
Said he was going to spend the blizzard
shacked up with a friend.

592
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,531
Lucky devil.

593
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:28,784
Jesus Christ, that's awful!

594
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:31,411
Christ Almighty,

595
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:34,539
what'd that Mexican fella do,
soak his old socks in a pot?

596
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:37,250
Yes... I-I think we all felt the same way,

597
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:40,462
but were a little too polite
to say something.

598
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,839
- He don't have that problem.
- Shit.

599
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,633
Where's the well water?

600
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,343
Over there.

601
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:55,686
So, all three of you fellas
headed to Red Rock

602
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:58,563
when the blizzard stopped you?

603
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:01,900
Yes. All three of us
were on that stagecoach out there.

604
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,789
Coffee beans.

605
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:18,500
Over there.

606
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:28,761
Get your hand out of there.

607
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:35,434
New sheriff of Red Rock's
travelin' with us.

608
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:38,437
Sheriff of Red Rock, that'll be the day.

609
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:41,398
He's a goddamn sheriff,
I'm a monkey's uncle.

610
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:42,607
Good.

611
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:45,613
Then you can share bananas
with your nigger friend in the stable.

612
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:47,988
So,

613
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:50,323
the new sheriff of Red Rock
is traveling with you?

614
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:53,829
He's lying.
He ain't sheriff of nothin'.

615
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,871
He's a Southern renegade.

616
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:59,543
He's just talking hisself
out of freezing to death is all.

617
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,626
What the fuck I tell you about talking?

618
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:05,633
I'll bust you in the mouth right in front
of these people. I don't give a fuck!

619
00:41:05,798 --> 00:41:09,553
- You never gave your name, sir.
- John Ruth.

620
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:12,264
- Are you a lawman?
- I'm taking her to the law.

621
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:16,143
- So you're a bounty hunter?
- That's right, buster.

622
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:19,895
Do you have a warrant?

623
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:22,775
- Yeah, course I do.
- May I see it?

624
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:27,652
Why?

625
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,864
You're supposed to produce it
upon request.

626
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,700
How am I supposed to know
you're not a villain,

627
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:36,203
kidnapping this woman,

628
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,330
without a warrant in your possession?

629
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,042
What's your name, buster?

630
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:46,129
Well, it certainly isn't Buster.

631
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:50,717
It's Oswaldo Mobray.

632
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:53,220
Oswaldo?

633
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:54,805
Yes.

634
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,891
Well,

635
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:01,353
I got my warrant, Oswaldo.

636
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:15,867
I take it you're Daisy Domergue?

637
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,619
- That's her.
- Yeah.

638
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:20,873
I see.

639
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:25,877
It says here "dead or alive."

640
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,838
Yeah. It does.

641
00:42:28,005 --> 00:42:30,006
Well, transporting a desperate,

642
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,551
hostile prisoner such as her

643
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,511
sounds like hard work.

644
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:39,143
Wouldn't transporting her be easier
if she were dead?

645
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:41,935
Well, no one said
the job was supposed to be easy.

646
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:44,563
And why is her hanging proper
so important to you?

647
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:48,277
Let's just say I don't like cheatin'
the hangman. He got to make a living, too.

648
00:42:48,442 --> 00:42:50,777
Well, I appreciate that.

649
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,780
Allow me to properly

650
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:55,782
introduce myself.

651
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,826
I'm Oswaldo Mobray,

652
00:42:57,993 --> 00:43:00,370
the hangman in these parts.

653
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,335
La-di-da.

654
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,174
- Looks like I brought you a customer.
- Yeah, so it would appear.

655
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:15,262
You ever spent two days or more
locked up with one of your customers before?

656
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:17,387
- I can't say I have.
- Don't talk to my prisoner.

657
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:18,930
I talk to my prisoner, that's it.

658
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,140
- You got it?
- I got it.

659
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:21,433
Jolly good.

660
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,064
You got anything in here besides coffee
that can help warm us up?

661
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,355
Well, the bar is open.

662
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:30,192
Follow moi.

663
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:45,666
Line, O.B.!

664
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:13,986
Hey.

665
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,211
You're all right, you're all right.

666
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:33,130
Come on, goddamn it. I'm cold!

667
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,638
I'll feed and water the horses.

668
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:44,724
You go inside and get some hot coffee.

669
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:47,521
Got some stew cooking.
Should be done soon.

670
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:48,895
Now, look.

671
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:52,399
No matter how bad this blizzard gets,

672
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:54,651
we still got to feed these horses

673
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:57,362
and take a squat from time to time.

674
00:44:57,529 --> 00:45:00,573
So me and Chris better lay out a line

675
00:45:00,741 --> 00:45:02,867
from the stable to the front door

676
00:45:03,035 --> 00:45:05,870
and from the front door to the shithouse.

677
00:45:06,038 --> 00:45:07,539
Okay?

678
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:12,586
Good idea.

679
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:15,338
Come on, Chris.

680
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:18,676
I'll give you a hand.

681
00:45:20,052 --> 00:45:22,679
No, no, no, no, no.
Go inside. Get warm.

682
00:45:22,846 --> 00:45:26,519
You're doin' stable work in a goddamn blizzard.
I offer to help, you say no?

683
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:30,103
You're right, amigo.

684
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,147
Muchas gracias.

685
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,234
All right. Follow me.

686
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,790
We're gonna drop one every ten paces,

687
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,500
- from here to the door.
- Yeah!

688
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,461
All right!

689
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:57,649
Now, you're wanted for murder.

690
00:46:57,816 --> 00:46:59,818
For the sake of my analogy,

691
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:01,986
let's just assume that you did it.

692
00:47:02,154 --> 00:47:06,243
Now, John Ruth wants to take you
back to Red Rock to stand trial for murder.

693
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:09,494
And if you're found guilty,

694
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:13,250
the people of Red Rock
will hang you in the town square.

695
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:15,166
And, as the hangman,

696
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,503
I will perform the execution.

697
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,214
And if all those things

698
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:23,174
end up taking place,

699
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:26,302
that's what civilized society

700
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:29,722
calls justice.

701
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,724
However,

702
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:35,019
if the relatives and the loved ones

703
00:47:35,187 --> 00:47:36,896
of the person you murdered

704
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:41,028
were outside that door right now,
and after busting down that door,

705
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:43,570
they drug you out into the snow

706
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:45,738
and hung you up by the neck,

707
00:47:45,906 --> 00:47:49,200
that would be frontier justice.

708
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:52,245
Now, the good part

709
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:54,080
about frontier justice

710
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:57,834
is it's very thirst-quenching.

711
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:02,422
The bad part is
it's apt to be wrong as right.

712
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:05,302
Well, not in your case.
In your case, you'd have it coming.

713
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:08,553
But other people, maybe not so much.

714
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,097
But ultimately, what's the real difference

715
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:12,682
between the two?

716
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:16,436
The real difference is me.

717
00:48:16,603 --> 00:48:18,062
The hangman.

718
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:19,939
To me, it doesn't matter what you did.

719
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:22,275
When I hang you,
I'll get no satisfaction from your death.

720
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:25,072
It's my job.
I hang you in Red Rock.

721
00:48:25,237 --> 00:48:26,905
I move on to the next town.

722
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:30,867
I hang someone else there.

723
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:35,079
The man who pulls the lever
that breaks your neck

724
00:48:35,247 --> 00:48:38,082
will be a dispassionate man.

725
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:42,503
And that dispassion
is the very essence of justice.

726
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:46,424
For justice delivered without dis-passion

727
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:51,179
is always in danger of not being justice.

728
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:52,722
Amen.

729
00:49:17,998 --> 00:49:22,421
No offense, cowboy fella.
Just gettin' your attention.

730
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:25,922
Yeah, well...

731
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:27,966
you got it.

732
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:30,718
What you writin', friend?

733
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,137
Only thing I'm qualified to write about.

734
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:35,431
What's that?

735
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:37,517
My life story.

736
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:39,352
You're writing your life story?

737
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:42,358
- You bet I am.
- Am I in it?

738
00:49:44,441 --> 00:49:46,067
You just entered.

739
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:49,153
Well, you like writing stories so much,

740
00:49:49,321 --> 00:49:52,119
why don't you tell me
the story that brings you here?

741
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,325
Who's asking?

742
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,327
I am. John Ruth.

743
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,871
I'm bringing in this one to Red Rock
to hang.

744
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,165
And ain't no way
I'm spending a couple of nights

745
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:03,584
under a roof with somebody
I don't know who they are,

746
00:50:03,752 --> 00:50:05,211
and I don't know who you are.

747
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:07,297
So, who are you?

748
00:50:07,464 --> 00:50:09,299
Joe Gage.

749
00:50:09,466 --> 00:50:11,384
- What?
- That's my name.

750
00:50:11,551 --> 00:50:14,598
- Joe Gage.
- Okay, Joe Gage.

751
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:16,472
Why you going to Red Rock?

752
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,599
I ain't, I ain't,
I ain't going to Red Rock.

753
00:50:18,767 --> 00:50:22,231
- Where you going?
- About nine miles outside of Red Rock.

754
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:24,900
- What's there?
- My mother.

755
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:29,405
- Your mother?
- Listen, I'm just a cowpuncher.

756
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:33,573
I just got back from a long drive, and...

757
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:38,202
and I wasn't
just an ass in a saddle this time.

758
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,705
I was a partner.

759
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:44,625
First time in my life
I made a pretty penny.

760
00:50:44,793 --> 00:50:46,294
And

761
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:48,796
figured I'd come home

762
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,631
and spend time with my mother

763
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:52,467
for Christmas.

764
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:54,135
Now, that's funny.

765
00:50:55,512 --> 00:50:58,934
'Cause you don't look like
the coming-home-for-Christmas type.

766
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:02,602
Yeah, well

767
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:05,855
you know, looks can be deceiving.

768
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:10,818
Because I definitely am a

769
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:14,864
coming-home-for-Christmas-
to-spend-time-with-Mother type.

770
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:20,244
Christmas with Mother, I mean,

771
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:22,414
it's a wonderful thing.

772
00:51:23,957 --> 00:51:26,292
Now, is that

773
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:28,086
good enough for you,

774
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:30,547
John Ruth?

775
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:33,758
For now.

776
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:36,469
You steer clear of my prisoner.

777
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:42,976
Hello, old-timer.

778
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:46,521
General.

779
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,190
General.

780
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:54,028
You, sir, are a hyena.

781
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:58,158
I have no wish to speak to you.

782
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:04,914
I've been called worse.

783
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,169
Fair enough, General.

784
00:52:10,462 --> 00:52:12,088
Sorry to bother you.

785
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:15,633
Hey!

786
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,510
- You gotta kick it open!
- Gotta kick it open!

787
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:19,345
- What?
- Kick it open!

788
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:22,480
- That latch, you gotta kick it open!
- You gotta kick it open!

789
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,808
Jesus Christ!

790
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:25,309
- Close it!
- Close it!

791
00:52:25,477 --> 00:52:26,727
- Close the door!
- What?

792
00:52:26,895 --> 00:52:28,312
- Close it!
- The goddamn door!

793
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,823
- It doesn't have a latch. Close it!
- It's already cold enough in here!

794
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:36,904
Doesn't have a latch.

795
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,823
- You gotta hammer up a board.
- You gotta nail it shut!

796
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:42,830
- The hammer and nails by the door.
- There's a hammer and nails right there!

797
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:45,079
God!

798
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:47,582
- Hold this here, Chris.
- Here! Here.

799
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:56,757
- Watch your fingers.
- Yeah.

800
00:52:56,925 --> 00:52:58,676
- Really nail it in!
- Yeah.

801
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:02,972
You need two pieces of wood.

802
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:04,849
You got to hammer another one.

803
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:06,726
One ain't good enough!

804
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:08,769
It's gonna blow right open!

805
00:53:08,937 --> 00:53:11,859
- Now, goddamn it!
- Gonna open if you don't ham...!

806
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:13,524
- Shut up!
- Got it!

807
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,985
Son of a bitch!

808
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:29,081
Jesus Christ.

809
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:31,125
That's door's a whore.

810
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:36,923
I get it. "Haberdashery."

811
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,883
That was a joke.

812
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,302
How's the coffee?

813
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:45,014
Now?
Pretty good, if I do say so myself.

814
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:49,102
Thank you.

815
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:05,952
Navajo!

816
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:07,870
Guess who he is.

817
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:11,999
Buffalo Bill?

818
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,751
Hardly.

819
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:15,586
No. I'm...

820
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,421
Oswaldo Mobray. I'm the...

821
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:19,632
He's the hangman of Red Rock.

822
00:54:20,717 --> 00:54:21,842
You are?

823
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:24,011
- Yes, I am.
- Well!

824
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:26,681
- Good to meet you,
- Yeah.

825
00:54:26,848 --> 00:54:28,266
- Mr...?
- Mobray.

826
00:54:28,433 --> 00:54:29,433
- Mobray.
- Yeah.

827
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:32,148
I'm Chris Mannix.
The new sheriff in Red Rock.

828
00:54:32,312 --> 00:54:34,480
- Really?
- Horseshit!

829
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:37,653
- Pay no attention to him.
- Horseshit!

830
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:42,074
Fella warmin' himself by that potbelly stove
is a hell of a driver named O.B.

831
00:54:42,238 --> 00:54:44,825
That's the only thing you've said
that's the truth.

832
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:48,286
You comin' into Red Rock
to hang Lance Lawson?

833
00:54:48,453 --> 00:54:50,454
- Precisely.
- Do you have the execution orders on you?

834
00:54:50,622 --> 00:54:52,164
- In my bag.
- May I see 'em?

835
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:53,916
Of course.

836
00:54:59,047 --> 00:55:01,215
Who's who's Lance Lawson?

837
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:03,718
He's a fella
been sittin' in the Red Rock jail

838
00:55:03,885 --> 00:55:05,344
about a month now.

839
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:07,513
He's the fella who shot the fella

840
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,182
who was sheriff 'fore me.

841
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,602
Precisely.

842
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:16,397
Thank you.

843
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:24,238
What did she mean when she said,

844
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:27,199
"The bounty hunter's nigger friend
in the stable"?

845
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:30,578
He's got a nigger bounty hunter friend
in the stable.

846
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:32,830
But all that just to guard her?

847
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:36,083
I don't think
that was the original idea, but...

848
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,794
that's the idea now.

849
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:41,213
Want a little snake bite in your coffee?

850
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:43,090
Yeah.

851
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,717
Five of you?

852
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:46,844
Well, well, well,
looks like Minnie's Haberdashery

853
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:49,388
is about to get cozy
for the next few days.

854
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:51,057
Yes, it does.

855
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,145
Here.

856
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:03,361
Are you the chap with the Lincoln letter?

857
00:56:03,528 --> 00:56:05,279
The Lincoln what?

858
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:08,908
Yes. The letter from Abraham Lincoln.

859
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:11,035
President Abraham Lincoln?

860
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:13,913
Yes. Weren't you pen pals?

861
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,248
With the president?

862
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:19,377
Well, I'm sorry,
I heard that somebody in your party

863
00:56:19,544 --> 00:56:21,253
had a letter from Abraham Lincoln.

864
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:24,260
- I assumed it was you.
- Not him!

865
00:56:24,424 --> 00:56:27,051
Black fella in the stable.

866
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:28,636
The nigger...

867
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:32,056
in the stable
has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?

868
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:33,808
Yeah.

869
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:38,688
The nigger in the stable
has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?

870
00:56:53,745 --> 00:56:55,955
What'd you say your name was again?

871
00:56:56,122 --> 00:56:57,957
- Bob.
- Warren.

872
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:00,334
Minnie and Sweet Dave in there?

873
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:04,466
Minnie and Sweet Dave went to visit her mother
on the north side of the mountain.

874
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,006
- What?
- Yeah.

875
00:57:06,174 --> 00:57:10,097
- Minnie ain't here?
- Yes, they're visiting her mother.

876
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:12,346
- Her mother?
- Yes.

877
00:57:15,475 --> 00:57:17,769
Never knew Minnie had a mother.

878
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:22,857
Well, everybody's got a mother.

879
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:26,277
Yeah, I suppose.

880
00:57:29,155 --> 00:57:31,282
And she left you in charge?

881
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:32,825
Si.

882
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,955
That sure don't sound like Minnie.

883
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,374
Are you calling me a liar?

884
00:57:42,335 --> 00:57:44,754
Well, not yet I ain't.

885
00:57:44,921 --> 00:57:47,131
Just sounds peculiar is all.

886
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:49,133
What sounds peculiar?

887
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,302
Well, first off, Minnie never struck me

888
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:53,220
as the sentimental type.

889
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:57,141
And secondly, I can't imagine
Sweet Dave lifting his fat ass

890
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:58,976
out his chair
long enough to fetch well water

891
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:01,353
unless Minnie was laying
a frying pan upside his head,

892
00:58:01,521 --> 00:58:03,481
let alone take a trip to the north side.

893
00:58:03,648 --> 00:58:05,858
Well, that sounds a whole lot

894
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:08,611
like you're calling me a liar,
mi negro amigo.

895
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:13,079
Yeah, it do sound
a whole lot like that, don't it?

896
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:16,619
But I still ain't done it yet.

897
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:20,664
Minnie still serve food?

898
00:58:20,832 --> 00:58:23,501
- Do you consider stew food?
- Yes.

899
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:25,252
Then we serve food.

900
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:29,006
She still stinking up the place
with Old Quail pipe tobacco?

901
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,721
Minnie doesn't smoke a pipe.

902
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:37,932
She rolls her own.

903
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,601
Red Apple Tobacco.

904
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:44,730
But, mi negro amigo,
I think you already know this.

905
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:47,024
Yeah, I do, Senor Bob.

906
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:49,735
Just seeing if you do.

907
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:08,045
Come on!

908
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,534
- Fill 'er up, O.B.
- Yeah.

909
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:37,658
Goddamn it.

910
00:59:39,452 --> 00:59:40,870
Thank you.

911
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:52,131
Well, cut my legs off and call me Shorty.

912
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:55,593
Is that General Sanford Smithers I see?

913
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:59,263
You got a good eye, son.

914
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:03,517
Well, I'll be double-dog damned!

915
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:05,938
General Sandy
"Don't Give a Damn" Smithers?

916
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,150
Captain Chris Mannix,
Mannix's Marauders.

917
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:12,776
Erskine's boy?

918
01:00:12,944 --> 01:00:14,570
Yes, sir.

919
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:17,781
May I sit down, sir?

920
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:20,618
Well, according to the Yankees,
it's a free country.

921
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:23,954
General Sandy Smithers.

922
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:26,290
Boy...

923
01:00:26,457 --> 01:00:27,917
oh, boy,

924
01:00:28,084 --> 01:00:31,337
did my daddy talk about you!

925
01:00:31,504 --> 01:00:35,174
I heard you gave those Blue Bellies
sweet hell.

926
01:00:36,968 --> 01:00:39,011
Me and my boys did our part.

927
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:41,513
Just like Erskine and his boys
did their part.

928
01:00:41,681 --> 01:00:43,432
Hell yeah, we did.

929
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,601
Yankee sons of bitches.

930
01:00:45,768 --> 01:00:49,063
I never knew your father, son.

931
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:53,651
But I always respected his resolve.

932
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:55,819
Well, thank you for saying that, General.

933
01:00:55,987 --> 01:00:58,698
Your respect would have meant
the world to him.

934
01:01:00,366 --> 01:01:03,077
Can I get you some coffee?

935
01:01:03,244 --> 01:01:04,828
That'd be nice.

936
01:01:04,996 --> 01:01:07,039
Well, how about a blanket?

937
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,459
That'd be even nicer.

938
01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:13,337
Hell, you know what?
You can have mine.

939
01:01:16,716 --> 01:01:18,718
Here we go, General.

940
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:23,389
So what brings you
out Wyoming way, sir?

941
01:01:23,556 --> 01:01:25,349
If you don't mind my askin'.

942
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:27,267
My boy.

943
01:01:27,435 --> 01:01:31,022
- You got a boy that lives in Red Rock?
- My son.

944
01:01:32,106 --> 01:01:34,525
Chester Charles Smithers.

945
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:38,028
He died out here a few years back.

946
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,239
Forgive me, sir.

947
01:01:40,406 --> 01:01:42,700
There's no forgiveness needed, son.

948
01:01:44,035 --> 01:01:47,162
Like I said, it was a few years back.

949
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,999
It was after he'd served his service.

950
01:01:52,043 --> 01:01:56,296
He came out here
to the hills of Wyoming...

951
01:01:56,464 --> 01:01:58,257
to make his fortune.

952
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:03,095
Never to be heard from again.

953
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:12,563
I bought him a symbolic plot...

954
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:15,941
in the Red Rock cemetery.

955
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:20,404
And I'm here to advise a stone maker
on his headstone.

956
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:22,948
Was he a goner for sure?

957
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:26,622
No chance he could be livin' the cold life
out in the woods?

958
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:29,538
It's a rough life, but folks can learn it.

959
01:02:29,705 --> 01:02:33,083
If he'd have done
what he came out here to do,

960
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,544
he'd have come home.

961
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:39,715
Hold it. Close it, close it!

962
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:45,721
You have to hold it closed
while I nail it shut.

963
01:02:45,888 --> 01:02:48,099
Well, who's the idiot
broke the damn door?

964
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:52,144
just fucking hold it closed!

965
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:55,523
Orale, cabron!

966
01:02:57,817 --> 01:03:00,152
Hold it closed.

967
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:01,820
Okay.

968
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:03,572
One more.

969
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:09,328
Keep holding, keep holding,

970
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:11,372
my negro amigo.

971
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:16,502
We need two pieces of wood.

972
01:03:19,255 --> 01:03:21,465
Orale, cabron! All right.

973
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:24,093
There you go, motherfucker!

974
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:30,015
Lot of hats, Senor Bob.

975
01:03:31,767 --> 01:03:35,733
Considering Minnie's "no hats indoors" policy,
which, if I remember correctly,

976
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:37,773
was one of them Bar of Iron rules.

977
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:40,484
Kind of rule she'd want kept up
in her absence.

978
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:44,492
You seem to have a laissez-faire attitude
when it come to the hats.

979
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:45,989
I'm guilty.

980
01:03:46,157 --> 01:03:48,784
I have a laissez-faire attitude
about the hats.

981
01:03:48,951 --> 01:03:51,328
How about we forget about the hats today

982
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:54,248
considering there is
a blizzard going on and on?

983
01:03:54,415 --> 01:03:56,792
We'll make tomorrow "No Hat Day"!

984
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:06,718
- A large black dog.
- Now take my tip

985
01:04:06,886 --> 01:04:08,512
<i>Before you ship to join</i>

986
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:10,889
- His name was Henry, I believe.
<i>- The iron gang</i>

987
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:12,891
- Labrador.
<i>- Don't be too gay</i>

988
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:14,560
<i>In Botany Bay</i>

989
01:04:14,727 --> 01:04:18,522
<i>Or else you'll surely hang</i>

990
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:20,816
<i>Or else you'll hang,
you'll hang, said he...</i>

991
01:04:20,983 --> 01:04:22,568
You know, my daddy...

992
01:04:22,735 --> 01:04:24,319
I-I said that my-my daddy

993
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:26,071
- always said that Davis
- A plum tree.

994
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:27,739
was a courageous man,

995
01:04:27,907 --> 01:04:29,533
but he should've put the capital

996
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,162
in Montgomery and not Richmond.

997
01:04:33,329 --> 01:04:35,581
Yes, sir. I agree with that.

998
01:04:35,748 --> 01:04:38,258
The army in northern Virginia
would've been used in a very different way.

999
01:04:38,425 --> 01:04:42,174
I said the army of north Virginia
would've been used in a very different way!

1000
01:04:42,338 --> 01:04:45,257
<i>They'll flog the poaching out of you</i>

1001
01:04:45,424 --> 01:04:47,593
<i>Out there in Botany Bay.</i>

1002
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,637
Shut up!

1003
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:57,561
O.B.

1004
01:04:59,855 --> 01:05:02,566
Do you know that nigger, sir?

1005
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:05,485
I don't know that nigger.

1006
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:10,074
But I know he's a nigger,
and that's all I need to know.

1007
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:20,375
Well...

1008
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,586
that nigger just ain't any nigger.

1009
01:05:22,753 --> 01:05:25,593
- That nigger, he...
- General Sanford Smithers?

1010
01:05:25,756 --> 01:05:28,133
Battle of Baton Rouge?

1011
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:33,096
Inform the nigger

1012
01:05:33,264 --> 01:05:36,225
in the cavalry officer's uniform

1013
01:05:36,392 --> 01:05:39,019
that I had a division of Confederates

1014
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:41,355
under my command...

1015
01:05:41,522 --> 01:05:43,398
in Baton Rouge.

1016
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:46,235
Major Nigger, General Smithers
wishes me to inform you...

1017
01:05:46,402 --> 01:05:48,946
I heard him, hillbilly.

1018
01:05:49,113 --> 01:05:53,617
Inform this old cracker
that I was in Baton Rouge also.

1019
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:55,328
On the other side.

1020
01:05:56,829 --> 01:05:58,664
That's interesting.

1021
01:05:58,831 --> 01:06:00,624
General Smithers,

1022
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:03,752
he said that he was also in Baton Rouge
on the other si...

1023
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:07,343
Captain Mannix, tell the nigger

1024
01:06:07,506 --> 01:06:09,800
that I don't acknowledge niggers

1025
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:11,468
in Northern uniforms.

1026
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:15,267
You captured
a whole colored command that day...

1027
01:06:15,431 --> 01:06:18,642
but not one colored trooper
made it to a camp, did they?

1028
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:21,144
We didn't have the time or the food...

1029
01:06:21,312 --> 01:06:24,314
nor the inclination...

1030
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:26,817
to care for Northern horses

1031
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:29,152
and least of all...

1032
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,238
Northern niggers!

1033
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:35,496
- So we shot 'em where they stood!
- Gentlemen.

1034
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:38,537
Gentlemen.

1035
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:41,248
I know Americans aren't apt

1036
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:44,209
to let a little thing
like unconditional surrender

1037
01:06:44,376 --> 01:06:46,962
get in the way of a good war.

1038
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:49,840
But I strongly suggest we don't restage

1039
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:52,301
the Battle of Baton Rouge

1040
01:06:52,468 --> 01:06:54,970
during a blizzard
in Minnie's Haberdashery.

1041
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,307
Now...

1042
01:06:58,474 --> 01:07:00,517
my Nubian friend...

1043
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:03,395
while I realize passions are high,

1044
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:05,480
that was a while ago.

1045
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:08,942
And if you shoot this unarmed old man,

1046
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:12,029
I guarantee I will hang you by the neck

1047
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:15,908
until you are dead
once we arrive in Red Rock.

1048
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,997
I damn well guarantee that, too.

1049
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:25,254
Yeah, Warren,
that's the problem with old men.

1050
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:27,210
You can kick 'em down the stairs

1051
01:07:27,378 --> 01:07:30,714
and say it's a accident,
but you can't just shoot 'em.

1052
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:33,592
Gentlemen... since we may be

1053
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,719
trapped here,

1054
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:37,721
close together-like,

1055
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:40,057
for a few days,

1056
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:43,602
may I suggest a possible solution?

1057
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:47,773
We divide Minnie's in half.

1058
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,941
The Northern side

1059
01:07:50,109 --> 01:07:52,569
and the Southern side.

1060
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:55,447
With the dinner table...

1061
01:07:55,614 --> 01:07:57,866
operating as a...

1062
01:07:58,033 --> 01:07:59,868
neutral territory.

1063
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:02,954
We could say that the fireplace...

1064
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:05,457
side of the room acts as a...

1065
01:08:05,624 --> 01:08:09,378
a symbolic representative of...

1066
01:08:09,545 --> 01:08:11,046
Georgia.

1067
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:15,175
While the bar...

1068
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:16,969
represents...

1069
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:22,891
...Philadelphia!

1070
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:26,019
Long as the bar's Philadelphia...

1071
01:08:26,186 --> 01:08:28,105
I agree.

1072
01:08:35,446 --> 01:08:38,281
We still got that deal we talked about
in the wagon?

1073
01:08:38,449 --> 01:08:41,451
- Thank you.
- I help you protect your $8,000,

1074
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:44,997
- you help me protect my ten?
- Yeah, I suppose.

1075
01:08:46,081 --> 01:08:47,833
One of them fellas

1076
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,461
is not what he says he is.

1077
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:53,088
What is he?

1078
01:08:53,255 --> 01:08:56,216
In cahoots with this one,
that's what he is.

1079
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:58,927
One of them, maybe even two of them,

1080
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:02,180
is here to see Domergue goes free.

1081
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:06,852
To accomplish that goal,
they'll kill everybody in here.

1082
01:09:07,019 --> 01:09:08,812
They got 'em a couple of days,

1083
01:09:08,979 --> 01:09:11,231
so all they got to do is sit tight

1084
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:14,734
and wait for a window of opportunity.

1085
01:09:14,902 --> 01:09:17,446
And that's when they strike.

1086
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:21,741
Bitch?

1087
01:09:21,909 --> 01:09:24,411
If you say so, John.

1088
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:28,540
Are you sure
you ain't just being paranoid?

1089
01:09:28,707 --> 01:09:31,543
Our best bet is this duplicitous fella

1090
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:34,588
ain't as cool a customer as Daisy here.

1091
01:09:34,755 --> 01:09:37,340
He won't have
the leather patience it takes

1092
01:09:37,508 --> 01:09:40,177
to just sit here and... wait.

1093
01:09:40,344 --> 01:09:42,512
Waiting for an opportunity

1094
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,849
and knowing it's the right one
isn't so easy.

1095
01:09:46,016 --> 01:09:47,726
He can't handle it,

1096
01:09:47,893 --> 01:09:49,769
he'll stop waitin'.

1097
01:09:49,937 --> 01:09:51,855
Try and create his opportunity,

1098
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:55,192
and that's when Mr. Jumpy
reveals himself.

1099
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:58,195
Now, what you got to say about all this?

1100
01:09:58,362 --> 01:09:59,905
What do I got to say?

1101
01:10:00,072 --> 01:10:02,908
About John Ruth's ravings?

1102
01:10:03,075 --> 01:10:06,244
He's absolutely right.

1103
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:10,582
Me and one of them fellas is in cahoots.

1104
01:10:10,749 --> 01:10:13,877
We're just waiting
for everybody to go to sleep.

1105
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:16,588
That's when we're gonna kill y'all.

1106
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:21,635
Okay, everybody.

1107
01:10:24,096 --> 01:10:26,765
Hear this.

1108
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,644
This here is Daisy Domergue.

1109
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:34,981
She's wanted dead or alive for murder.

1110
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,651
$10,000.

1111
01:10:37,818 --> 01:10:40,403
That money's mine, boys.

1112
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:43,156
Don't want to share it,

1113
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:45,617
and I ain't gonna lose it.

1114
01:10:46,702 --> 01:10:48,537
When that sun comes out,

1115
01:10:48,704 --> 01:10:52,583
I'm taking this woman
into Red Rock to hang.

1116
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:00,132
Now...

1117
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:06,179
...is there anybody here

1118
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:09,349
committed to stoppin' me...

1119
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:11,268
from doing that?

1120
01:11:21,737 --> 01:11:23,488
Really?

1121
01:11:23,655 --> 01:11:26,199
Nobody got a problem with this?

1122
01:11:31,872 --> 01:11:33,248
Well...

1123
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:36,376
I guess that's very fortunate for me.

1124
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:39,129
However...

1125
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:42,549
I hope you all understand

1126
01:11:42,716 --> 01:11:44,801
I can't just...

1127
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:46,845
take your word.

1128
01:11:47,012 --> 01:11:49,598
Circumstances force me to...

1129
01:11:49,765 --> 01:11:51,766
take...

1130
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:54,060
precautions.

1131
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:56,980
When you say...

1132
01:11:57,147 --> 01:11:59,816
"precautions"...

1133
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:03,486
why do I feel that you mean me?

1134
01:12:03,654 --> 01:12:07,077
- Because I'm gonna take your gun, son.
- You are?

1135
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,658
Yes, I am.

1136
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:11,995
- Nothing personal.
- Just mine?

1137
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:14,789
Hangman's got himself a gun, too.

1138
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:18,627
I'll be dealing with his gun
after I deal with yours.

1139
01:12:25,926 --> 01:12:27,802
I feel kind of...

1140
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:29,804
naked without it.

1141
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,766
I still got mine.

1142
01:12:34,685 --> 01:12:36,770
I'll protect you.

1143
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:47,405
A bastard's work is never done.

1144
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:49,616
John Ruth?

1145
01:12:49,783 --> 01:12:52,744
That's right, Joe Gage.

1146
01:12:52,911 --> 01:12:55,163
- Now, give me the gun.
- If you want it...

1147
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:58,918
...you're gonna have to come and take...

1148
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,087
Calm down.

1149
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,842
Take your hand away from your gun.

1150
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:12,222
Blink if you're calm.

1151
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:16,105
- He blink?
- He blinked.

1152
01:13:16,268 --> 01:13:19,438
Blink if you're gonna remain calm.

1153
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:24,776
He blinked.

1154
01:13:24,943 --> 01:13:26,737
Take his pistol.

1155
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:30,323
I'm real sorry about this, son.

1156
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:34,119
Like I said...

1157
01:13:34,286 --> 01:13:36,579
nothing personal, just...

1158
01:13:36,747 --> 01:13:38,915
a precaution.

1159
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,046
Pretty sneaky.

1160
01:15:00,831 --> 01:15:03,333
Afraid the same applies to you, too,

1161
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,877
Mr... Mobray.

1162
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:07,962
Precautions must be taken

1163
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:11,424
because life is too sweet to lose.

1164
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,139
Hand me that little bucket.

1165
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:31,194
O.B.

1166
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:33,696
Go to the outhouse.

1167
01:15:33,864 --> 01:15:37,492
Take this bucket and...
dump it down the shithole.

1168
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:41,913
Why do I got to go outside?

1169
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,706
Well, your jacket's already on,

1170
01:15:43,874 --> 01:15:46,835
and I sorta kinda trust you.

1171
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:21,369
- Grab the other cup.
- Yeah, I got it.

1172
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:27,626
After you, Major.

1173
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:45,894
Okay.

1174
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:50,857
I'm gonna cut you loose while we eat.

1175
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:54,360
Don't get any ideas.
I ain't goin' soft on ya.

1176
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:57,280
Lift your ass even one inch off that seat,

1177
01:16:57,447 --> 01:17:01,034
and I'll put a bullet
right in your goddamn throat.

1178
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:03,453
Come here.

1179
01:17:25,475 --> 01:17:27,852
So, Domergue...

1180
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:31,105
I suppose this blizzard
counts as a stroke of luck

1181
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:33,232
far as you're concerned.

1182
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,318
You don't hear me complainin', do ya?

1183
01:17:35,485 --> 01:17:37,612
No, I sure don't.

1184
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:48,039
Well, how 'bout you, Oswaldo?

1185
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,334
How 'bout me what?

1186
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:55,050
Look... considering all the things
I done for money,

1187
01:17:55,213 --> 01:17:57,048
I ain't one to judge, but...

1188
01:17:57,215 --> 01:17:59,425
don't you feel just the least little bad

1189
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:01,928
about hangin' a woman?

1190
01:18:02,095 --> 01:18:04,847
Well, until they invent a trigger
a woman can't pull,

1191
01:18:05,015 --> 01:18:08,184
if you're a hangman,
you're going to hang women.

1192
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:12,067
Well, hell, Ozzie, I guess
I ain't never looked at it like that before.

1193
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:14,607
When it comes to some of them
mean bastards out there,

1194
01:18:14,774 --> 01:18:16,567
it's the only thing does the job.

1195
01:18:16,735 --> 01:18:19,570
You really only need
to hang mean bastards.

1196
01:18:19,738 --> 01:18:22,699
But mean bastards, you need to hang.

1197
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:33,918
You goddamn son of a bitch!

1198
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:37,255
I almost died out there!

1199
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:44,137
I ain't ever... going out in that shit

1200
01:18:44,304 --> 01:18:47,432
ever, ever again!

1201
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:11,164
You okay, O.B.?

1202
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:12,707
I'm fine.

1203
01:19:12,874 --> 01:19:14,625
I'll be fine.

1204
01:19:14,793 --> 01:19:17,796
I just need to get warm.

1205
01:19:22,092 --> 01:19:24,302
You want some stew, O.B.?

1206
01:19:24,469 --> 01:19:25,928
Stew?

1207
01:19:26,096 --> 01:19:28,556
Later.

1208
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:33,061
Yeah.

1209
01:19:33,228 --> 01:19:35,188
That's nice.

1210
01:19:59,003 --> 01:20:00,671
So...

1211
01:20:00,839 --> 01:20:02,757
how you doing, Black Major?

1212
01:20:02,924 --> 01:20:04,842
I ain't in the mood, Chris Mannix.

1213
01:20:05,009 --> 01:20:07,262
Leave me be from your horseshit.

1214
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:10,765
John Ruth says you got a Lincoln letter.

1215
01:20:10,932 --> 01:20:13,810
I told you, jackass,
go hee-haw someplace else.

1216
01:20:13,977 --> 01:20:15,520
That's right, John.

1217
01:20:15,687 --> 01:20:17,563
You did say that, didn't you?

1218
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,732
Yeah. I did.

1219
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:23,611
So...

1220
01:20:23,778 --> 01:20:26,322
you got a letter from Abraham Lincoln?

1221
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:27,990
Yes.

1222
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:30,827
The... Abraham Lincoln?

1223
01:20:30,994 --> 01:20:33,667
- Yes.
- Abraham Lincoln?

1224
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:35,581
The president of the United States?

1225
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:37,500
Yes.

1226
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,673
- Of America?
- Yes.

1227
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:42,004
Wrote you a letter...

1228
01:20:42,172 --> 01:20:44,804
- Personally?
- Yes.

1229
01:20:44,966 --> 01:20:47,051
Personally, as in "Dear Major Warren"?

1230
01:20:47,218 --> 01:20:49,387
No, personally, as in "Dear Marquis."

1231
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:50,638
"Dear Marquis"?

1232
01:20:50,805 --> 01:20:53,896
Abraham Lincoln, the president
of the United States of America?

1233
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:55,434
Yes.

1234
01:20:56,472 --> 01:20:58,938
- May I see it?
- No, you may not.

1235
01:21:00,023 --> 01:21:01,899
But the way John tells it,

1236
01:21:02,066 --> 01:21:03,734
you weren't just
some random nigger soldier

1237
01:21:03,902 --> 01:21:05,903
picked from a pile of letters.

1238
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:09,115
Way John tells it...

1239
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:11,159
y'all had a correspondence.

1240
01:21:11,326 --> 01:21:12,535
Yes.

1241
01:21:12,702 --> 01:21:14,704
The way John tells it...

1242
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:18,374
y'all was practically pen pals.

1243
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:20,793
Yes.

1244
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,838
And a pen pal's...

1245
01:21:24,005 --> 01:21:26,424
practically a friend.

1246
01:21:37,477 --> 01:21:39,645
John Ruth...

1247
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,689
you really think a nigger,

1248
01:21:41,856 --> 01:21:45,067
drummed out of the cavalry
with a yellow stripe down his back,

1249
01:21:45,235 --> 01:21:46,736
was practically friends

1250
01:21:46,903 --> 01:21:49,574
with the president
of the United States of America?

1251
01:21:53,284 --> 01:21:55,912
John Ruth, I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

1252
01:21:56,079 --> 01:21:58,789
but ain't nobody in Minnie's Haberdashery
ever corresponded

1253
01:21:58,957 --> 01:22:00,958
with Abraham Lincoln.

1254
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:02,752
Least of all,

1255
01:22:02,919 --> 01:22:04,837
that nigger there!

1256
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:16,557
Was all that horseshit?

1257
01:22:18,142 --> 01:22:20,436
Course it was.

1258
01:22:30,363 --> 01:22:32,990
Good one, Warren!

1259
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:34,909
Talk that sass, nigger!

1260
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:37,453
Talk that sass!

1261
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:50,758
Well, I guess it's true
what they say about you people.

1262
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:56,973
Can't trust a fuckin' word
comes out of your mouth.

1263
01:22:57,140 --> 01:23:00,643
What's the matter, John Ruth?

1264
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,436
I hurt your feelings?

1265
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:04,897
As a matter of fact...

1266
01:23:05,064 --> 01:23:06,858
you did.

1267
01:23:09,986 --> 01:23:11,696
I-I know...

1268
01:23:11,863 --> 01:23:14,573
I'm the only black son of a bitch
you ever conversed with,

1269
01:23:14,741 --> 01:23:16,659
so I'm gonna cut you some slack.

1270
01:23:16,826 --> 01:23:19,537
But you got no idea what it's like

1271
01:23:19,704 --> 01:23:22,498
being a black man facin' down America.

1272
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:24,959
Only time black folks is safe

1273
01:23:25,126 --> 01:23:27,378
is when white folks is disarmed.

1274
01:23:27,545 --> 01:23:31,507
And this letter had the desired effect

1275
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:34,594
of disarmin' white folks.

1276
01:23:36,137 --> 01:23:38,848
Call it what you want.

1277
01:23:39,015 --> 01:23:42,018
I call it a dirty fuckin' trick.

1278
01:23:51,277 --> 01:23:53,738
You want to know why I lie

1279
01:23:53,905 --> 01:23:56,324
about somethin' like that, white man?

1280
01:24:00,578 --> 01:24:03,873
Got me on that stagecoach, didn't it?

1281
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,215
Well, I'll tell you
like the good Lord told John.

1282
01:24:13,383 --> 01:24:15,718
A letter from Abraham Lincoln
wouldn't have had

1283
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:17,762
that kind of effect on me.

1284
01:24:17,929 --> 01:24:19,805
I might let a whore piss on it.

1285
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:23,351
- I spit on it.
- Good for you, sister!

1286
01:24:40,118 --> 01:24:41,619
Warren.

1287
01:24:41,786 --> 01:24:44,246
Goddamn it,
you leave that old man alone.

1288
01:24:44,414 --> 01:24:46,332
Stand down, you son of a bitch.

1289
01:24:46,499 --> 01:24:49,043
I shared a battlefield with this man.

1290
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:52,463
Or would you deny me that, too?

1291
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:58,594
I suppose you were there.

1292
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:00,513
May I join you?

1293
01:25:05,184 --> 01:25:07,395
Yes, you may.

1294
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:59,238
Damn it.

1295
01:26:04,619 --> 01:26:08,080
So, how's life since the war?

1296
01:26:13,127 --> 01:26:16,130
Got both my legs.

1297
01:26:16,297 --> 01:26:19,592
Both my arms.

1298
01:26:19,759 --> 01:26:21,844
I can't complain.

1299
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:25,473
Got a woman?

1300
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:28,142
Fever took her start of this last winter.

1301
01:26:29,769 --> 01:26:31,437
What was her name?

1302
01:26:31,604 --> 01:26:33,939
Betsy.

1303
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:36,442
Georgia gal?

1304
01:26:36,609 --> 01:26:38,528
Augusta.

1305
01:26:40,363 --> 01:26:42,615
Atlanta boy, Augusta girl.

1306
01:26:44,575 --> 01:26:47,495
I used to raise Kentucky horses.

1307
01:26:47,662 --> 01:26:50,164
And her pa
was the owner of the breedership

1308
01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:52,416
where I bought most of my ponies.

1309
01:26:54,669 --> 01:26:57,296
Goddamn it.

1310
01:26:57,463 --> 01:26:59,298
I made a good deal on her.

1311
01:26:59,465 --> 01:27:01,675
Took the stake he gave me

1312
01:27:01,842 --> 01:27:04,220
and bought a bunch of peach orchards.

1313
01:27:04,387 --> 01:27:06,430
Set myself up pretty well.

1314
01:27:06,597 --> 01:27:08,432
Did a hell of a lot better

1315
01:27:08,599 --> 01:27:11,727
than either one of my no-good brothers,
that's for damn sure.

1316
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:16,232
Yeah, your boy come up here
a few years back.

1317
01:27:17,567 --> 01:27:21,028
He spoke highly of his mama, too.

1318
01:27:21,195 --> 01:27:23,739
You knew my boy?

1319
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:26,534
Did I know him?

1320
01:27:26,701 --> 01:27:28,202
Yep.

1321
01:27:29,704 --> 01:27:31,539
Yeah, I knew him.

1322
01:27:31,706 --> 01:27:34,166
You did not know my boy.

1323
01:27:37,587 --> 01:27:39,255
Suit yourself.

1324
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:44,426
Did you know my son?

1325
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:47,930
I know the day he died.

1326
01:27:48,097 --> 01:27:50,808
- Do you?
- No.

1327
01:27:50,975 --> 01:27:52,977
Do you want to know
what day that was?

1328
01:27:53,144 --> 01:27:54,562
Yes.

1329
01:27:57,898 --> 01:27:59,692
The day...

1330
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:01,861
he met me.

1331
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,545
He come up here

1332
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,839
to do a little nigger head-huntin'.

1333
01:28:22,006 --> 01:28:24,592
By then, the reward was...

1334
01:28:24,759 --> 01:28:27,344
$5,000 and braggin' rights.

1335
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:29,346
But to battle-hard rebs,

1336
01:28:29,513 --> 01:28:32,058
$5,000 just to cut off a nigger's head?

1337
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:36,353
That's good money.

1338
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,648
So them Johnnies climbed this mountain,

1339
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:42,234
lookin' for fortune.

1340
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:46,488
There wasn't no fortune to be found.

1341
01:28:46,656 --> 01:28:48,699
All they found...

1342
01:28:48,866 --> 01:28:50,618
was me.

1343
01:28:52,453 --> 01:28:55,289
All them crackers come up here
sang a different tune

1344
01:28:55,456 --> 01:28:58,793
when they found theyself
at the mercy of a nigger's gun.

1345
01:29:02,004 --> 01:29:03,505
Let's just forget it.

1346
01:29:03,673 --> 01:29:06,800
I'll go my way, you go your'n.

1347
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:08,927
That's your boy Chester talkin'.

1348
01:29:09,095 --> 01:29:11,597
You're a goddamn lie!

1349
01:29:11,764 --> 01:29:13,724
"If you just let me go home

1350
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:16,018
"to my family, I-I swear...

1351
01:29:16,185 --> 01:29:19,897
I'll never set foot in Wyoming again."

1352
01:29:21,816 --> 01:29:23,943
That's what they all said.

1353
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,531
Beggin' for his life...

1354
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:31,617
your boy told me

1355
01:29:31,784 --> 01:29:35,538
his whole life story.

1356
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:41,132
And you... was in that story, General.

1357
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:45,255
And when I knew me I had

1358
01:29:45,423 --> 01:29:50,683
the son... of the Bloody Nigger Killer
of Baton Rouge...

1359
01:29:50,845 --> 01:29:54,264
I knew me I was gonna have some fun.

1360
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:57,267
You shut your lyin' nigger lips up!

1361
01:29:57,435 --> 01:30:01,443
General Smithers, don't you listen to him.
He didn't know your boy.

1362
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:04,358
He just heard tell why you're here, is all.

1363
01:30:04,525 --> 01:30:07,736
It was cold the day I killed your boy.

1364
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:09,571
And I don't mean

1365
01:30:09,739 --> 01:30:12,074
snowy-mountain-Wyoming cold.

1366
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:14,743
It was colder than that.

1367
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:17,913
And on that cold day, with your boy

1368
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,709
at the business end of my gun barrel,

1369
01:30:21,876 --> 01:30:24,378
I made him strip...

1370
01:30:24,545 --> 01:30:27,548
right down to his bare ass.

1371
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:33,220
Then I told him to start walkin'.

1372
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:03,917
I walked his naked ass for two hours

1373
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:06,587
'fore the cold collapsed him.

1374
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:10,424
You never even knew my boy?

1375
01:31:10,591 --> 01:31:12,843
No, he didn't!

1376
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:16,018
He's just a sneaky nigger
trying to get you to go for that gun.

1377
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:20,434
Then... he commenced to beggin' again.

1378
01:31:20,601 --> 01:31:24,229
But this time,
he wasn't beggin' to go home.

1379
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:27,775
He knew he'd never see his home again.

1380
01:31:27,942 --> 01:31:30,152
He wasn't beggin' for his life, neither,

1381
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:33,864
'cause he knew that was long gone.

1382
01:31:34,031 --> 01:31:37,159
All he wanted...

1383
01:31:37,326 --> 01:31:39,453
was a blanket.

1384
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:42,956
Now, don't judge your boy
too harshly, General.

1385
01:31:43,123 --> 01:31:46,460
You ain't never been cold
as your boy was that day.

1386
01:31:48,629 --> 01:31:50,881
You'd be surprised

1387
01:31:51,048 --> 01:31:54,176
what a man that cold

1388
01:31:54,343 --> 01:31:56,970
would do for a blanket.

1389
01:31:57,137 --> 01:32:00,099
You want to know what your boy did?

1390
01:32:02,768 --> 01:32:05,813
I pulled my big black pecker

1391
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:08,273
out of my pants...

1392
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,901
and I made him crawl
through the snow

1393
01:32:11,068 --> 01:32:13,904
on all fours over to it.

1394
01:32:21,579 --> 01:32:24,122
Then I grabbed me a handful

1395
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:29,216
of that black hair
at the back of his head...

1396
01:32:29,378 --> 01:32:33,715
and I stuck my big black johnson

1397
01:32:33,883 --> 01:32:38,011
right down his goddamn throat.

1398
01:32:38,178 --> 01:32:41,723
And it was full of blood, so it was warm.

1399
01:32:41,891 --> 01:32:45,853
You bet your sweet ass it was warm.

1400
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:50,065
And Chester Charles Smithers

1401
01:32:50,232 --> 01:32:53,861
sucked on that warm black dingus

1402
01:32:54,028 --> 01:32:56,322
for long as he could!

1403
01:33:07,666 --> 01:33:09,835
You're startin' to see pictures, ain't ya?

1404
01:33:10,002 --> 01:33:11,837
Your boy...

1405
01:33:12,004 --> 01:33:14,256
black dude's dingus in his mouth...

1406
01:33:14,423 --> 01:33:17,759
him sh-sh-shakin', him cryin',

1407
01:33:17,927 --> 01:33:19,511
me laughin'...

1408
01:33:23,432 --> 01:33:27,811
...and him not understandin'.

1409
01:33:29,313 --> 01:33:31,733
But you understand, don't you, Sandy?

1410
01:33:31,891 --> 01:33:34,235
I never did give your boy that blanket...

1411
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:37,529
even after all he did,

1412
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:42,284
and he did everything I asked.

1413
01:33:43,994 --> 01:33:45,996
No blanket.

1414
01:33:46,163 --> 01:33:49,625
That blanket was just
a heart-breakin' liar's promise.

1415
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:54,468
Kind of like those uniforms
the Union issued those colored troops

1416
01:33:54,630 --> 01:33:58,425
that you chose not to acknowledge.

1417
01:34:03,889 --> 01:34:07,976
So what you gonna do, old man?

1418
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:11,605
You gonna spend the next two, three days

1419
01:34:11,772 --> 01:34:14,984
ignorin' the nigger that killed your boy?

1420
01:34:16,110 --> 01:34:19,696
Ignorin' how I made him suffer?

1421
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:23,533
Ignoring how I made him...

1422
01:34:23,701 --> 01:34:26,787
lick... all over my johnson?

1423
01:34:29,498 --> 01:34:33,460
The dumbest thing your boy ever did

1424
01:34:33,627 --> 01:34:36,505
was to let me know...

1425
01:34:36,672 --> 01:34:39,091
he was your boy.

1426
01:35:19,214 --> 01:35:21,133
<i>About 15 minutes has past</i>

1427
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:24,136
<i>since we last left our characters.</i>

1428
01:35:24,303 --> 01:35:28,181
<i>Joe Gage volunteered
to take Smithers' dead body outside.</i>

1429
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:31,393
<i>Straws were drawn
to see who'd help him.</i>

1430
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:33,937
<i>O.B. lost.</i>

1431
01:35:34,104 --> 01:35:36,606
<i>Chris, John Ruth and Oswaldo
had a vigorous debate</i>

1432
01:35:36,774 --> 01:35:40,407
<i>about the legality of the self-defense murder
that just transpired.</i>

1433
01:35:40,569 --> 01:35:42,988
<i>Major Marquis Warren,
who was supremely confident</i>

1434
01:35:43,155 --> 01:35:45,407
<i>about the legality of what just transpired,</i>

1435
01:35:45,574 --> 01:35:48,160
<i>ignored them, sat at the table by himself</i>

1436
01:35:48,327 --> 01:35:50,454
<i>and drank brandy.</i>

1437
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:54,833
<i>Captain Chris Mannix
donned the dead general's coat</i>

1438
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,669
<i>and joined Oswaldo
in lighting the candles and lanterns.</i>

1439
01:35:57,836 --> 01:35:59,671
Hey, Ozzie!

1440
01:35:59,838 --> 01:36:01,840
Now, you got the right idea.

1441
01:36:02,007 --> 01:36:03,925
Let's light this place up.

1442
01:36:04,093 --> 01:36:06,178
<i>John Ruth held the door closed,</i>

1443
01:36:06,345 --> 01:36:08,680
<i>waiting for Joe Gage and O.B. to return.</i>

1444
01:36:13,602 --> 01:36:16,396
<i>Bob enjoyed a Manzana Roja.</i>

1445
01:36:22,903 --> 01:36:25,864
<i>Domergue, however,
hasn't moved from her spot</i>

1446
01:36:26,031 --> 01:36:28,700
<i>at the community dinner table
since John Ruth uncuffed her.</i>

1447
01:36:28,867 --> 01:36:31,078
John Ruth.

1448
01:36:31,245 --> 01:36:33,622
Yeah.

1449
01:36:33,789 --> 01:36:36,124
Can I play that guitar over there?

1450
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:38,668
<i>Let's go back a bit.</i>

1451
01:36:38,836 --> 01:36:42,214
Your boy, black dude's dingus
in his mouth.

1452
01:36:42,381 --> 01:36:44,508
<i>15 minutes ago, Major Warren</i>

1453
01:36:44,675 --> 01:36:47,052
<i>shot General Smithers
in front of everybody.</i>

1454
01:36:47,219 --> 01:36:49,679
<i>But about 40 seconds before that,</i>

1455
01:36:49,847 --> 01:36:54,023
<i>something equally as important happened,
but not everybody saw it.</i>

1456
01:36:54,184 --> 01:36:56,478
<i>While Major Warren
was captivating the crowd</i>

1457
01:36:56,645 --> 01:36:59,981
<i>with tales of black dicks in white mouths,</i>

1458
01:37:00,149 --> 01:37:01,900
<i>somebody...</i>

1459
01:37:02,067 --> 01:37:03,610
<i>poisoned the coffee.</i>

1460
01:37:03,777 --> 01:37:07,614
He did everything I asked.

1461
01:37:07,781 --> 01:37:09,574
No blanket.

1462
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:12,828
<i>And the only one to see him do it...</i>

1463
01:37:16,957 --> 01:37:19,168
<i>...was Domergue.</i>

1464
01:37:24,381 --> 01:37:27,342
<i>That's why this chapter is called</i>

1465
01:37:27,509 --> 01:37:29,469
<i>"Domergue's Got a Secret."</i>

1466
01:37:32,931 --> 01:37:35,433
John Ruth.

1467
01:37:35,601 --> 01:37:37,310
Yeah.

1468
01:37:37,477 --> 01:37:40,314
Can I play that guitar over there?

1469
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:48,197
Yeah.

1470
01:37:53,744 --> 01:37:56,872
You come back
with anything else but a guitar,

1471
01:37:57,039 --> 01:37:59,332
my pistol plays a tune.

1472
01:37:59,499 --> 01:38:02,085
"Domergue's Death March."

1473
01:38:02,252 --> 01:38:05,469
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

1474
01:38:55,639 --> 01:38:59,017
<i>Listen for a moment, lads</i>

1475
01:38:59,184 --> 01:39:02,729
<i>And hear me tell my tale</i>

1476
01:39:02,896 --> 01:39:06,358
<i>O'er the sea from England shore</i>

1477
01:39:06,525 --> 01:39:10,278
<i>I was condemned to sail</i>

1478
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:13,698
<i>Jury found me guilty, sir</i>

1479
01:39:13,865 --> 01:39:17,119
<i>And said the judge, said he</i>

1480
01:39:19,288 --> 01:39:21,039
<i>For life, Jim Jones</i>

1481
01:39:21,206 --> 01:39:26,545
<i>I sentence you across the stormy sea</i>

1482
01:39:29,047 --> 01:39:31,716
<i>Have no chance of mischief there</i>

1483
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:35,220
<i>Remember what I say</i>

1484
01:39:35,387 --> 01:39:38,431
<i>They'll flog the poaching out of you</i>

1485
01:39:38,598 --> 01:39:41,935
<i>Out there in Botany Bay</i>

1486
01:39:42,102 --> 01:39:44,980
<i>Waves were high upon the sea</i>

1487
01:39:45,147 --> 01:39:48,650
<i>The winds approaching gales</i>

1488
01:39:50,402 --> 01:39:53,405
<i>I'd rather drowned in misery</i>

1489
01:39:53,572 --> 01:39:57,367
<i>Than come to New South Wales</i>

1490
01:39:58,952 --> 01:40:01,663
<i>The waves were high upon the sea</i>

1491
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:04,582
<i>When the pirates came along</i>

1492
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:08,211
<i>But the soldiers on our convict ship</i>

1493
01:40:08,378 --> 01:40:11,881
<i>Were full 500 strong</i>

1494
01:40:12,049 --> 01:40:15,302
<i>They opened fire and somehow drove</i>

1495
01:40:15,469 --> 01:40:20,181
<i>That pirate ship away</i>

1496
01:40:20,349 --> 01:40:23,226
<i>I'd rather join that pirate ship</i>

1497
01:40:23,393 --> 01:40:27,022
<i>Than gone to Botany Bay</i>

1498
01:40:28,857 --> 01:40:30,608
<i>And one dark night</i>

1499
01:40:30,776 --> 01:40:35,113
<i>When everything is quiet in the town</i>

1500
01:40:36,782 --> 01:40:39,451
<i>I'll kill you bastards one and all</i>

1501
01:40:39,618 --> 01:40:42,537
<i>I'll gun the floggers down</i>

1502
01:40:42,704 --> 01:40:46,082
<i>Give them all a little shock</i>

1503
01:40:46,249 --> 01:40:50,545
<i>Remember what I say</i>

1504
01:40:50,712 --> 01:40:53,757
<i>Yet regret they sent Jim Jones</i>

1505
01:40:53,924 --> 01:40:56,760
<i>In chains to Botany Bay.</i>

1506
01:41:02,724 --> 01:41:07,354
That's the one you like to sing
in the stagecoach?

1507
01:41:07,521 --> 01:41:10,654
- Yeah.
- It's kinda pretty.

1508
01:41:10,816 --> 01:41:12,567
Got another verse to it?

1509
01:41:12,734 --> 01:41:14,653
Yeah, lots.

1510
01:41:16,446 --> 01:41:19,157
Well, go ahead, sing it.

1511
01:41:23,912 --> 01:41:26,039
Whatever you say, John.

1512
01:41:29,209 --> 01:41:32,253
<i>Now day and night the irons clang</i>

1513
01:41:32,421 --> 01:41:36,091
<i>And like poor galley slaves</i>

1514
01:41:36,258 --> 01:41:39,260
<i>We toil and toil and when we die</i>

1515
01:41:39,428 --> 01:41:42,972
<i>Must fill dishonored graves</i>

1516
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:45,850
<i>By and by I'll break my chains</i>

1517
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:50,897
<i>And to the bush I'll go</i>

1518
01:41:51,064 --> 01:41:55,985
<i>And you'll be dead behind me, John</i>

1519
01:41:56,153 --> 01:41:59,823
<i>When I get to Mexico.</i>

1520
01:42:06,746 --> 01:42:09,207
Give me that guitar.

1521
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:14,343
- Music time's over!
- Wha... Hey!

1522
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:19,301
Turn around!

1523
01:42:26,641 --> 01:42:28,101
John, no!

1524
01:42:28,268 --> 01:42:29,727
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1525
01:42:29,895 --> 01:42:32,230
Shut up!

1526
01:44:15,584 --> 01:44:19,128
When you get to hell, John,

1527
01:44:19,296 --> 01:44:21,256
tell 'em Daisy sent ya.

1528
01:44:34,603 --> 01:44:38,064
Mannix, the coffee!

1529
01:45:31,493 --> 01:45:33,411
My God!

1530
01:45:37,332 --> 01:45:39,002
Give me that fucking gun.

1531
01:45:39,959 --> 01:45:42,128
Don't test me, bitch.

1532
01:45:45,423 --> 01:45:46,799
Everybody!

1533
01:45:46,966 --> 01:45:48,509
Get your backsides up

1534
01:45:48,677 --> 01:45:50,511
against that back wall over yonder.

1535
01:45:50,679 --> 01:45:53,139
Well, goddamn it!

1536
01:45:53,306 --> 01:45:55,141
Get or don't get, Joe Gage.

1537
01:45:55,308 --> 01:45:56,643
It's up to you.

1538
01:45:56,810 --> 01:45:58,978
- I'm gettin'.
- Then get!

1539
01:46:11,324 --> 01:46:13,284
You, too, Senor Bob.

1540
01:46:18,331 --> 01:46:21,882
Everybody turn around
and put your hands on that wall.

1541
01:46:25,964 --> 01:46:28,049
Move them damn snowshoes!

1542
01:46:49,237 --> 01:46:51,072
Everybody keep your mouths shut.

1543
01:46:51,239 --> 01:46:52,782
Do like I say.

1544
01:46:52,949 --> 01:46:54,659
You open your mouth,

1545
01:46:54,826 --> 01:46:56,786
you gonna get a bullet.

1546
01:46:56,953 --> 01:46:59,628
Move a little sudden, a little strange,

1547
01:46:59,789 --> 01:47:01,958
you gonna get a bullet.

1548
01:47:02,125 --> 01:47:04,335
Not a warnin', not a question.

1549
01:47:04,502 --> 01:47:06,170
A bullet.

1550
01:47:06,337 --> 01:47:08,631
You got that?

1551
01:47:08,798 --> 01:47:10,174
Let me hear you say, "I got it!"

1552
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:11,592
- I got it.
- I got it.

1553
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:14,643
- I got it.
- We have it.

1554
01:47:16,139 --> 01:47:18,309
Chris Mannix,
come over here on this side.

1555
01:47:19,768 --> 01:47:21,144
Come on.

1556
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:28,359
Take this gun out my holster.

1557
01:47:39,329 --> 01:47:41,164
Point it at them.

1558
01:47:42,582 --> 01:47:44,459
Now, like I said,

1559
01:47:44,626 --> 01:47:47,336
anybody does anything,

1560
01:47:47,504 --> 01:47:49,756
and I mean anything,

1561
01:47:49,923 --> 01:47:51,633
you kill 'em.

1562
01:47:55,428 --> 01:47:57,138
So...

1563
01:47:57,305 --> 01:48:01,357
you finally decided I'm tellin' the truth
about bein' the sheriff of Red Rock?

1564
01:48:03,019 --> 01:48:05,146
I don't know about all that.

1565
01:48:05,313 --> 01:48:07,732
But I know you ain't the killer
poisoned that coffee,

1566
01:48:07,899 --> 01:48:10,359
'cause you almost drunk it
your own damn self.

1567
01:48:10,527 --> 01:48:12,111
One of them is.

1568
01:48:20,745 --> 01:48:23,540
Give me the key.
Give me the key!

1569
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:39,263
You motherfucking black bastard!

1570
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:41,516
You're gonna die on this mountain,

1571
01:48:41,683 --> 01:48:44,102
and I'm gonna fucking laugh when you do!

1572
01:48:45,895 --> 01:48:48,696
- What'd I say 'bout talkin'?
- Bastard.

1573
01:48:48,857 --> 01:48:51,234
Meant it, didn't I?

1574
01:48:52,402 --> 01:48:56,203
And you need to understand
you just killed the only man here

1575
01:48:56,364 --> 01:48:59,492
committed to gettin' you to Red Rock alive.

1576
01:49:05,290 --> 01:49:07,291
Now, one of y'all...

1577
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:10,378
is workin' with her.

1578
01:49:10,545 --> 01:49:12,547
Or two of y'all is workin' with her.

1579
01:49:12,714 --> 01:49:15,341
Or all y'all is.

1580
01:49:17,969 --> 01:49:19,804
But only one of you

1581
01:49:19,971 --> 01:49:21,515
poisoned the coffee.

1582
01:49:25,184 --> 01:49:27,812
Now, what charms this bitch got

1583
01:49:27,979 --> 01:49:30,606
make a man brave a blizzard,

1584
01:49:30,773 --> 01:49:32,609
kill in cold blood?

1585
01:49:34,444 --> 01:49:36,446
I'm sure I don't know.

1586
01:49:40,325 --> 01:49:43,619
But John Ruth's
tryin' to hang your woman.

1587
01:49:43,786 --> 01:49:45,538
So you kill him.

1588
01:49:45,705 --> 01:49:47,456
Okay.

1589
01:49:47,624 --> 01:49:49,584
Maybe.

1590
01:49:49,751 --> 01:49:52,837
But O.B. wasn't hangin' nobody.

1591
01:49:53,004 --> 01:49:54,338
He damn sure wasn't.

1592
01:49:54,505 --> 01:49:57,181
But he sure enough layin' over there
dead now, though, ain't he?

1593
01:49:57,342 --> 01:49:59,385
He damn sure is, you sons of bitches.

1594
01:49:59,552 --> 01:50:02,263
Just like any one of us
would've drunk that coffee.

1595
01:50:02,430 --> 01:50:04,473
Like me, goddamn it.

1596
01:50:04,641 --> 01:50:07,560
Now, those of y'all
with your hands on the wall

1597
01:50:07,727 --> 01:50:10,778
don't practice in poison
need to think about that.

1598
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:16,826
Think about how it could've been you
rollin' around here on this floor.

1599
01:50:16,986 --> 01:50:20,996
And how the man standin' next to you
would be responsible.

1600
01:50:21,157 --> 01:50:23,576
And I know who I got my money on.

1601
01:50:23,743 --> 01:50:26,037
That's right, Joe Gage.

1602
01:50:26,204 --> 01:50:27,748
I'm lookin' at you.

1603
01:50:29,582 --> 01:50:31,918
Not so fast, Chris.

1604
01:50:32,085 --> 01:50:34,211
We'll get there.

1605
01:50:34,379 --> 01:50:37,340
Let's slow it down.

1606
01:50:37,507 --> 01:50:39,926
Let's slow it way down.

1607
01:50:45,473 --> 01:50:47,183
Who made the coffee?

1608
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:48,935
He did.

1609
01:50:50,979 --> 01:50:55,573
- Yeah, he did, didn't he?
- Yeah, he did, didn't he?

1610
01:50:55,733 --> 01:50:58,945
But it's the stew that's got me thinkin'.

1611
01:51:00,363 --> 01:51:03,240
Now, how long you said
Minnie been gone?

1612
01:51:03,408 --> 01:51:04,993
A week?

1613
01:51:06,119 --> 01:51:07,578
Si.

1614
01:51:08,663 --> 01:51:10,247
See...

1615
01:51:10,415 --> 01:51:13,334
my mama used to make stew,

1616
01:51:13,501 --> 01:51:15,378
and it always tasted the same,

1617
01:51:15,545 --> 01:51:17,004
no matter the meat.

1618
01:51:17,171 --> 01:51:20,681
And there was another fellow
on the plantation, Uncle Charly.

1619
01:51:20,842 --> 01:51:22,343
He made stew, too.

1620
01:51:22,510 --> 01:51:24,136
And like my mama,

1621
01:51:24,303 --> 01:51:28,140
I ate his stew
from the time I was a whipper

1622
01:51:28,307 --> 01:51:30,685
till I was a full-grown man.

1623
01:51:31,894 --> 01:51:33,771
No matter the meat,

1624
01:51:33,938 --> 01:51:36,774
it always tasted like Uncle Charly's stew.

1625
01:51:38,067 --> 01:51:41,660
Now, I ain't had Minnie's stew
in six months, so I ain't no expert.

1626
01:51:41,821 --> 01:51:45,866
But that damn sure is...

1627
01:51:46,034 --> 01:51:48,661
Minnie's stew.

1628
01:51:48,828 --> 01:51:51,122
So if Minnie is on the north side

1629
01:51:51,289 --> 01:51:53,749
visitin' her mama for a week,

1630
01:51:53,916 --> 01:51:56,753
how'd she make the stew this mornin'?

1631
01:52:01,049 --> 01:52:03,884
And this...

1632
01:52:04,052 --> 01:52:07,805
this is Sweet Dave's chair.

1633
01:52:07,972 --> 01:52:09,974
When I sat in it earlier,

1634
01:52:10,141 --> 01:52:11,892
I couldn't believe it.

1635
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:14,520
Nobody sits in Sweet Dave's chair.

1636
01:52:14,687 --> 01:52:16,897
This may be Minnie's place,

1637
01:52:17,065 --> 01:52:20,276
but this is damn sure

1638
01:52:20,443 --> 01:52:22,528
Sweet Dave's chair.

1639
01:52:24,864 --> 01:52:28,034
And if he went to the north side...

1640
01:52:29,786 --> 01:52:31,954
...I'm pretty goddamn sure

1641
01:52:32,121 --> 01:52:34,832
this chair be goin' with him.

1642
01:52:39,462 --> 01:52:41,255
What's in the chair?

1643
01:52:41,422 --> 01:52:43,549
Just what I thought.

1644
01:52:43,716 --> 01:52:46,677
Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.

1645
01:52:52,433 --> 01:52:56,729
So, are you actually
accusing me of murder?

1646
01:52:59,941 --> 01:53:02,860
Way I see it, Senor Bob,

1647
01:53:03,027 --> 01:53:06,113
is whoever is workin' with her

1648
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:09,075
ain't who they say they is.

1649
01:53:09,242 --> 01:53:11,035
And if it's you,

1650
01:53:11,202 --> 01:53:13,287
that means Minnie and her man

1651
01:53:13,454 --> 01:53:15,247
ain't at her mama's.

1652
01:53:15,414 --> 01:53:18,834
They layin' out back there
dead somewhere.

1653
01:53:19,001 --> 01:53:21,003
Or if it's you, little British man,

1654
01:53:21,170 --> 01:53:24,340
the real Oswaldo Mobray
layin' in a ditch somewhere

1655
01:53:24,507 --> 01:53:26,967
and you just a English fella
passin' off his papers.

1656
01:53:27,135 --> 01:53:29,845
Or we go by my theory,

1657
01:53:30,012 --> 01:53:32,890
which is the ugliest guy did it.

1658
01:53:33,057 --> 01:53:35,559
Which makes it you, Joe Gage.

1659
01:53:35,726 --> 01:53:39,980
So I take it
you deduced the coffee was poisoned

1660
01:53:40,148 --> 01:53:42,108
while you were murdering the old man?

1661
01:53:43,276 --> 01:53:44,902
Yes.

1662
01:53:45,069 --> 01:53:47,530
Well, mi negro amigo,

1663
01:53:47,697 --> 01:53:49,824
during that whole incident,

1664
01:53:49,991 --> 01:53:52,535
I was sitting on that side of the room

1665
01:53:52,702 --> 01:53:54,870
playing "Silent Night" on the piano.

1666
01:53:55,037 --> 01:53:57,998
I ain't say you poisoned the coffee.

1667
01:53:58,166 --> 01:54:01,127
I said you didn't make the stew.

1668
01:54:02,670 --> 01:54:06,090
My theory is...

1669
01:54:06,257 --> 01:54:09,218
you workin' with the man

1670
01:54:09,385 --> 01:54:11,011
who poisoned the coffee,

1671
01:54:11,179 --> 01:54:13,514
and both of y'all murdered Minnie,

1672
01:54:13,681 --> 01:54:16,559
Sweet Dave and whoever else
picked this bad-luck day

1673
01:54:16,726 --> 01:54:19,520
to visit Minnie's Haberdashery
this mornin'.

1674
01:54:19,687 --> 01:54:23,399
And at some point, y'all intended

1675
01:54:23,566 --> 01:54:26,026
to bushwhack John Ruth

1676
01:54:26,194 --> 01:54:28,904
and free Daisy.

1677
01:54:29,071 --> 01:54:31,448
But you didn't count on the blizzard,

1678
01:54:31,616 --> 01:54:34,660
and you didn't count on the two of us.

1679
01:54:39,332 --> 01:54:41,292
That's far as I got. How am I doing?

1680
01:54:45,213 --> 01:54:47,631
You're a real imaginative nigger,

1681
01:54:47,798 --> 01:54:49,967
ain't you?

1682
01:54:50,134 --> 01:54:52,928
So, do you intend to murder me

1683
01:54:53,095 --> 01:54:55,389
based on a far-fetched nigger theory,

1684
01:54:55,556 --> 01:54:57,934
or can you prove it, cabron?

1685
01:54:59,477 --> 01:55:04,565
It ain't so far-fetched, Senor Bob.

1686
01:55:04,732 --> 01:55:07,485
And it's a little bit more than a theory.

1687
01:55:11,864 --> 01:55:14,366
How long you say
you been workin' for Minnie?

1688
01:55:14,533 --> 01:55:16,285
Four months.

1689
01:55:18,246 --> 01:55:20,873
See, if you'd have been here
two and a half years ago,

1690
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:24,835
you'd know 'bout that sign
used to hang up over the bar.

1691
01:55:25,002 --> 01:55:27,463
Minnie mention that to you?

1692
01:55:28,756 --> 01:55:30,591
No.

1693
01:55:30,758 --> 01:55:33,552
You want to know
what that sign said, Senor Bob?

1694
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:39,976
"No dogs or Mexicans allowed."

1695
01:55:43,479 --> 01:55:47,031
Now, Minnie hung that sign up
the day she opened this haberdashery.

1696
01:55:47,191 --> 01:55:50,110
And it hung over that bar every day

1697
01:55:50,278 --> 01:55:53,239
till she took it down
a little over two years ago.

1698
01:55:54,865 --> 01:55:56,617
You know why she took it down?

1699
01:55:58,494 --> 01:56:00,997
She started lettin' in dogs.

1700
01:56:04,709 --> 01:56:08,629
Now, Minnie liked just about everybody,

1701
01:56:08,796 --> 01:56:10,881
but she sure don't

1702
01:56:11,048 --> 01:56:12,841
like Mexicans.

1703
01:56:13,009 --> 01:56:14,885
So when you tell me

1704
01:56:15,052 --> 01:56:18,555
Minnie went to the north side
to visit her mama,

1705
01:56:18,723 --> 01:56:21,267
well, I find that highly unlikely.

1706
01:56:21,434 --> 01:56:24,645
But okay, maybe.

1707
01:56:24,812 --> 01:56:27,356
But when you tell me

1708
01:56:27,523 --> 01:56:31,151
Minnie Mink took the haberdashery,

1709
01:56:31,319 --> 01:56:35,197
the most precious thing to her
in the whole world,

1710
01:56:35,364 --> 01:56:39,327
and left it in the hands
of a goddamn Mexican?

1711
01:56:40,828 --> 01:56:45,297
Well, that's what I meant in the barn when
I said that sure don't sound like Minnie.

1712
01:56:47,376 --> 01:56:50,337
Now I am calling you a liar,

1713
01:56:50,504 --> 01:56:52,465
Senor Bob.

1714
01:56:53,716 --> 01:56:55,676
And if you lyin',

1715
01:56:55,843 --> 01:56:57,345
which you are...

1716
01:56:58,971 --> 01:57:01,981
...then you killed Minnie.
And Sweet Dave.

1717
01:57:20,409 --> 01:57:22,786
Four measly bullets,

1718
01:57:22,953 --> 01:57:26,040
and there goes Senor Bob.

1719
01:57:27,708 --> 01:57:30,961
But that still don't get us no closer

1720
01:57:31,128 --> 01:57:34,465
to which one of y'all
poisoned the coffee, though.

1721
01:57:34,632 --> 01:57:37,766
- Do it, Chris?
- No, it sure don't.

1722
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:47,610
Now, one of y'all poisoned this coffee
to free Daisy.

1723
01:57:47,770 --> 01:57:49,396
If I don't hear a confession

1724
01:57:49,563 --> 01:57:52,649
from one of you motherfuckers
quick, fast and in a hurry,

1725
01:57:52,817 --> 01:57:55,319
I'm gonna pour this whole pot of coffee

1726
01:57:55,486 --> 01:57:58,114
down that bitch's goddamn throat.

1727
01:57:59,407 --> 01:58:02,534
Okay. Time's up.

1728
01:58:02,701 --> 01:58:03,952
Stop!

1729
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:05,954
All right, I did it.

1730
01:58:06,122 --> 01:58:08,040
It was me. I poisoned the coffee.

1731
01:58:09,166 --> 01:58:12,128
I fuckin' knew it!

1732
01:58:13,838 --> 01:58:16,173
You gonna die now,
you murderin' bastard!

1733
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:19,343
Major Warren,
please let me send this ugly

1734
01:58:19,510 --> 01:58:21,345
son of a bitch to hell.

1735
01:58:21,512 --> 01:58:23,263
You killed O.B.

1736
01:58:23,431 --> 01:58:26,774
He was worth ten of you.
Warren, can I kill him?

1737
01:58:26,934 --> 01:58:28,606
Say adios to your huevos.

1738
01:58:35,651 --> 01:58:38,404
Major Warren!

1739
01:58:55,546 --> 01:58:58,715
I ain't got no gun,

1740
01:58:58,883 --> 01:59:01,343
Sheriff.

1741
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:37,254
Roy!

1742
01:59:37,421 --> 01:59:39,006
Good boy.

1743
01:59:42,885 --> 01:59:44,386
Get up!

1744
01:59:44,553 --> 01:59:46,854
Get up there! Get up!

1745
01:59:47,014 --> 01:59:49,600
Packer, Roy, get up!

1746
01:59:49,767 --> 01:59:51,351
Get up!

1747
01:59:51,519 --> 01:59:54,028
Get up there! Get up!
Get up!

1748
01:59:54,188 --> 01:59:57,072
Get up there! Get up!
Get up!

1749
01:59:57,233 --> 01:59:58,568
Go!

1750
02:00:00,778 --> 02:00:04,156
Go! Go! Go!

1751
02:00:04,323 --> 02:00:06,659
Go! Go!

1752
02:00:08,786 --> 02:00:10,120
Go!

1753
02:01:11,181 --> 02:01:12,683
Get up. Get up.

1754
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:14,935
- Get up! Get up!
- Get up!

1755
02:01:15,102 --> 02:01:17,862
Get up! Get up!

1756
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:30,291
Get up! Get up!

1757
02:01:33,954 --> 02:01:35,539
Get up! Get up!

1758
02:01:51,805 --> 02:01:53,140
Easy.

1759
02:01:54,475 --> 02:01:56,351
Hey, Charly, my boy.

1760
02:01:56,518 --> 02:01:59,069
- How the hell are you?
- Hiya, Ed. Hiya, Judy.

1761
02:01:59,229 --> 02:02:00,606
Yeah!

1762
02:02:02,941 --> 02:02:05,201
- How many you got?
- Full house today, friend.

1763
02:02:05,361 --> 02:02:08,287
- Got one in there waitin'.
- Well, he's gonna have to keep on waitin'.

1764
02:02:08,447 --> 02:02:10,873
- We ain't got no room.
- Well, you need to tell Minnie.

1765
02:02:11,033 --> 02:02:13,918
'Cause he been here two days,
and Minnie wants him out of here.

1766
02:02:14,078 --> 02:02:15,912
Well, I can't give him a seat I don't have.

1767
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:18,540
Listen, why don't you
take the passengers inside

1768
02:02:18,707 --> 02:02:21,509
and introduce 'em to Minnie,
warm yourself up and drink some coffee.

1769
02:02:21,669 --> 02:02:23,005
Yeah.

1770
02:02:28,302 --> 02:02:31,143
Here we are, everybody.
Minnie's Haberdashery.

1771
02:02:31,303 --> 02:02:33,771
Step outside, you and your friends
can stretch your legs.

1772
02:02:33,931 --> 02:02:37,525
When you're ready, step on inside,
get warm by the fire, get some coffee in you.

1773
02:02:37,685 --> 02:02:39,478
I'll introduce you to Minnie.

1774
02:02:42,690 --> 02:02:45,359
Hiya, Minnie!

1775
02:03:03,085 --> 02:03:06,846
Now, Minnie, I'm not tryin' to tell you how
to run your business, but I would think coffee

1776
02:03:07,005 --> 02:03:09,216
would be the first thing you'd make.

1777
02:03:09,383 --> 02:03:12,268
- Come on in, everybody. Don't be shy.
- Hats!

1778
02:03:12,428 --> 02:03:14,721
Everybody, this is Minnie,
and this is her place.

1779
02:03:14,888 --> 02:03:18,100
Behind me, pluckin' that chicken,
is Gemma.

1780
02:03:19,393 --> 02:03:21,687
Lovely smile, that Gemma.

1781
02:03:21,854 --> 02:03:25,698
Now, the fella in the uniform I don't know,
but the one he's playing chess with is Sweet Dave.

1782
02:03:25,858 --> 02:03:29,076
- Hiya, Dave.
- Hey, Judy.

1783
02:03:29,236 --> 02:03:32,288
And, Minnie, these are the passengers.

1784
02:03:32,448 --> 02:03:34,282
Well, that's not good enough.

1785
02:03:34,450 --> 02:03:36,243
Go on, take away them rags,

1786
02:03:36,410 --> 02:03:38,620
let's see some faces,
let's hear some names.

1787
02:03:38,787 --> 02:03:41,331
Oswaldo Mobray, madam.

1788
02:03:41,498 --> 02:03:42,749
Joe Gage.

1789
02:03:42,916 --> 02:03:44,960
Bob.

1790
02:03:45,127 --> 02:03:46,712
And I'm Jody.

1791
02:03:46,879 --> 02:03:49,464
It's a pleasant surprise
to find such a warm sanctuary

1792
02:03:49,631 --> 02:03:51,758
in the middle of such a cold hell.

1793
02:03:51,925 --> 02:03:54,810
Well, make yourself comfortable.
Get warm by the fire.

1794
02:03:54,970 --> 02:03:58,731
We're just gonna go warm ourselves
by the stove, if that's all right.

1795
02:03:58,891 --> 02:04:00,600
Stove, fireplace, whatever.

1796
02:04:00,768 --> 02:04:01,727
Just get warm.

1797
02:04:01,894 --> 02:04:04,987
And Judy said somethin'
about the best coffee in the world.

1798
02:04:05,147 --> 02:04:07,107
Yes. I do believe
Judy did say something

1799
02:04:07,274 --> 02:04:09,526
about the best coffee in the world.

1800
02:04:09,693 --> 02:04:12,661
Well, I don't know about all that,
but I tell you what it is.

1801
02:04:12,821 --> 02:04:14,281
It's hot, it's strong, and it's good.

1802
02:04:14,448 --> 02:04:17,374
And in this here snow,
it sure enough warms your ass up.

1803
02:04:17,534 --> 02:04:19,828
You don't need to sell it, Minnie,
you need to make it.

1804
02:04:19,995 --> 02:04:23,714
And you need to get your ass out there and
help Charly with them bags and get Ed in here.

1805
02:04:23,874 --> 02:04:25,542
Yes, ma'am.

1806
02:04:25,709 --> 02:04:27,711
- But fix that coffee.
- I'll fix you!

1807
02:04:30,172 --> 02:04:31,757
I don't know, some old man.

1808
02:04:31,924 --> 02:04:34,009
Well, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do about it.

1809
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:36,135
I'm just telling you what she said.

1810
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:40,557
Anyway, she sent me out here to help Charly.
She wants to talk to you.

1811
02:04:40,724 --> 02:04:44,068
- Charly, you got a hold of these fellas?
- Got 'em, Ed.

1812
02:05:00,536 --> 02:05:03,663
Miss Minnie,
would you roll me a cigarette?

1813
02:05:03,831 --> 02:05:06,674
Sure, honey.
I smoke Red Apple tobacco.

1814
02:05:06,834 --> 02:05:09,844
- That all right?
- That's my favorite.

1815
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:15,592
Don't mind me, gentlemen.

1816
02:05:15,759 --> 02:05:18,178
I'm just watching.

1817
02:05:18,345 --> 02:05:20,972
You play?

1818
02:05:21,139 --> 02:05:25,227
You know, I must have had
at least 12 people

1819
02:05:25,394 --> 02:05:27,687
teach me that goddamn game.

1820
02:05:27,855 --> 02:05:31,233
Just never could keep
the moves in my head.

1821
02:05:32,651 --> 02:05:35,536
But if I'm not disturbing,
I'd like to watch.

1822
02:05:35,696 --> 02:05:38,956
Hell no. I like whippin' this old man's ass
in front of a audience.

1823
02:05:39,116 --> 02:05:41,493
You ain't whippin' shit!

1824
02:05:43,203 --> 02:05:45,705
Merci beaucoup, Mademoiselle Minnie.

1825
02:05:45,873 --> 02:05:48,799
That's real nice. What is that?

1826
02:05:48,959 --> 02:05:51,886
- That's French.
- You speak French?

1827
02:05:52,465 --> 02:05:55,723
- Oui.
- "Oui"? What does that mean?

1828
02:05:55,883 --> 02:05:57,592
It means "yes."

1829
02:05:57,759 --> 02:05:59,970
Oui, yes.

1830
02:06:00,137 --> 02:06:03,557
Hey, hey, Dave, ask me if my ass is fat.

1831
02:06:03,724 --> 02:06:06,442
- What?
- Ask me if my ass is fat.

1832
02:06:06,602 --> 02:06:09,612
- It is.
- I said ask me.

1833
02:06:09,771 --> 02:06:12,823
- Why?
- Just do it!

1834
02:06:12,983 --> 02:06:14,776
Is your ass fat?

1835
02:06:14,943 --> 02:06:16,319
Oui.

1836
02:06:16,486 --> 02:06:18,614
Look at that, y'all, I can speak French.

1837
02:06:56,443 --> 02:06:58,278
Are you the

1838
02:06:58,445 --> 02:07:00,199
jelly bean salesman around here?

1839
02:07:01,531 --> 02:07:03,783
How many peppermint sticks
I get for a nickel?

1840
02:07:03,951 --> 02:07:05,911
Five.

1841
02:07:06,078 --> 02:07:08,038
All right.

1842
02:07:10,457 --> 02:07:12,626
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sugar.

1843
02:07:12,793 --> 02:07:14,753
Okay.

1844
02:07:22,010 --> 02:07:25,138
Allow me to assist you, madam.

1845
02:07:45,492 --> 02:07:47,077
I'm bringing in your bags

1846
02:07:47,244 --> 02:07:50,377
in case anybody wants
to change your clothes before Red Rock.

1847
02:07:59,715 --> 02:08:02,551
Peppermint stick?

1848
02:08:06,847 --> 02:08:08,890
Thanks.

1849
02:08:12,019 --> 02:08:14,688
So why do they call you
"Six-Horse Judy" anyway?

1850
02:08:16,398 --> 02:08:20,576
'Cause I'm the only Judy you've ever seen
that can drive a six-horse team.

1851
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:22,071
Yeah.

1852
02:08:23,447 --> 02:08:25,741
Kind of a stupid question.

1853
02:08:27,743 --> 02:08:29,411
Do you mind holding this for me?

1854
02:08:31,371 --> 02:08:34,040
Rock steady, madam.

1855
02:08:34,207 --> 02:08:36,793
Rock steady.

1856
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:41,006
You got a very sweet little accent.

1857
02:08:41,173 --> 02:08:43,049
Where's that from, England?

1858
02:08:43,216 --> 02:08:44,886
I take exception to that.

1859
02:08:46,470 --> 02:08:48,888
- New Zealand.
- Careful, madam. Precarious.

1860
02:08:49,056 --> 02:08:50,977
Is that anywhere near Old Zealand?

1861
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:14,914
Auckland?

1862
02:09:15,082 --> 02:09:16,833
What the fuck's an Auckland?

1863
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,543
It's where I'm from.

1864
02:09:18,710 --> 02:09:20,211
It's our biggest city.

1865
02:09:20,378 --> 02:09:21,838
Coffee!

1866
02:09:23,090 --> 02:09:26,392
- Coffee's ready.
- Well, it's about damn time!

1867
02:09:28,428 --> 02:09:30,221
Best coffee on the mountain.

1868
02:09:30,388 --> 02:09:32,515
I don't know about all that.

1869
02:09:32,682 --> 02:09:35,935
Stagecoach drivers like it,
passengers not so much.

1870
02:09:36,103 --> 02:09:38,354
Most find it a mite too strong.

1871
02:09:38,522 --> 02:09:41,237
Can't be too strong on this mountain.

1872
02:09:41,391 --> 02:09:42,811
Thank you.

1873
02:09:46,988 --> 02:09:48,364
Well?

1874
02:09:48,532 --> 02:09:50,075
What do you think?

1875
02:10:12,848 --> 02:10:14,268
Shit, fuck!

1876
02:10:16,434 --> 02:10:17,936
Shit!

1877
02:10:30,531 --> 02:10:32,908
Man, this little old fucker
looks really good.

1878
02:10:33,075 --> 02:10:34,368
I don't know.

1879
02:10:34,535 --> 02:10:37,538
He's a nice touch. He's authentic.

1880
02:10:38,039 --> 02:10:39,498
This old man?

1881
02:10:39,665 --> 02:10:41,000
Yep.

1882
02:10:41,292 --> 02:10:43,419
We can't trust this old fart.

1883
02:10:43,586 --> 02:10:47,756
Sure we can.
You just have to convince him to trust us.

1884
02:10:47,923 --> 02:10:51,135
Without those two fatsos,
this place is going to seem real empty.

1885
02:10:51,469 --> 02:10:53,513
- Si.
- He adds something.

1886
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:55,308
Not much, but something.

1887
02:10:57,184 --> 02:10:58,770
What you think, Pete?

1888
02:11:02,939 --> 02:11:07,368
Well, I must admit, he does make the setup
more convincing.

1889
02:11:09,946 --> 02:11:12,832
Okay. I'll talk to the old man.

1890
02:11:12,991 --> 02:11:16,336
You three collect the bodies
and chuck 'em in that well out there.

1891
02:11:17,704 --> 02:11:21,382
And then start unhitchin' the horses and
gettin' 'em in the barn and gettin' 'em fed.

1892
02:11:21,541 --> 02:11:25,261
Well, hang on. I mean,
puttin' the horses away, that's easy enough,

1893
02:11:25,420 --> 02:11:28,389
but draggin' these fat bastards up and down
the mountain, that's fuckin' impossible, mate.

1894
02:11:28,548 --> 02:11:30,133
Okay.

1895
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:34,270
Well, this is a store, so there's gotta be
a wheelbarrow around here somewhere.

1896
02:11:34,429 --> 02:11:36,139
Start with the horses,

1897
02:11:36,306 --> 02:11:40,143
and as soon as I get through
with this old hickory tree,

1898
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:42,479
I'll come out and help you, okay?

1899
02:11:49,277 --> 02:11:51,696
Hey, Pete, grab my coat, will ya?

1900
02:12:09,047 --> 02:12:10,924
<i>Now</i>

1901
02:12:11,091 --> 02:12:12,884
<i>You're all</i>

1902
02:12:13,051 --> 02:12:15,887
<i>Alone</i>

1903
02:12:18,431 --> 02:12:20,183
<i>Feelin'</i>

1904
02:12:20,350 --> 02:12:24,229
<i>That nobody wants you</i>

1905
02:12:27,357 --> 02:12:29,776
<i>And you're looking</i>

1906
02:12:29,943 --> 02:12:32,403
<i>For someone</i>

1907
02:12:32,570 --> 02:12:37,116
<i>To hold your hand</i>

1908
02:12:37,284 --> 02:12:39,994
<i>Someone</i>

1909
02:12:40,161 --> 02:12:44,874
<i>Who understands</i>

1910
02:12:48,128 --> 02:12:49,712
<i>Now</i>

1911
02:12:49,879 --> 02:12:53,675
<i>You're by yourself</i>

1912
02:12:55,927 --> 02:12:59,472
<i>And you're feelin'</i>

1913
02:12:59,639 --> 02:13:02,433
<i>The world close</i>

1914
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:05,145
<i>In on you</i>

1915
02:13:06,438 --> 02:13:08,648
<i>And you're askin'...</i>

1916
02:13:08,815 --> 02:13:10,775
Look.

1917
02:13:10,942 --> 02:13:12,568
I just started workin' here.

1918
02:13:12,736 --> 02:13:14,906
Whatever Minnie did to make y'all mad...

1919
02:13:15,989 --> 02:13:17,782
I had nothin' to do with it.

1920
02:13:17,949 --> 02:13:19,492
<i>Someone...</i>

1921
02:13:29,961 --> 02:13:32,630
Well, old man.

1922
02:13:34,341 --> 02:13:35,967
If you...

1923
02:13:36,134 --> 02:13:37,677
was a cat,

1924
02:13:37,844 --> 02:13:40,596
what just happened here

1925
02:13:40,764 --> 02:13:43,016
would count as one of your nine lives.

1926
02:13:45,727 --> 02:13:48,271
Do you realize how close you came

1927
02:13:48,438 --> 02:13:50,273
to being tossed on a pile of niggers?

1928
02:13:50,440 --> 02:13:51,941
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1929
02:13:52,108 --> 02:13:55,870
And when it comes to that pile of niggers
that we buildin' out back,

1930
02:13:56,029 --> 02:13:57,864
won't take nothin'
to make you general of it.

1931
02:13:58,031 --> 02:14:00,116
You believe that?

1932
02:14:00,283 --> 02:14:02,493
I expect no less.

1933
02:14:02,660 --> 02:14:05,872
Not so fast, old man.

1934
02:14:06,039 --> 02:14:08,041
You might have a way out of this yet.

1935
02:14:11,252 --> 02:14:14,422
Later today,

1936
02:14:14,589 --> 02:14:16,591
dirty...

1937
02:14:16,758 --> 02:14:19,302
son of a gun

1938
02:14:19,469 --> 02:14:21,638
is gonna come in here...

1939
02:14:25,308 --> 02:14:28,144
...and he's gonna have my sister with him.

1940
02:14:28,311 --> 02:14:31,856
And he is gonna have her in chains.

1941
02:14:34,901 --> 02:14:38,029
He's taking her to Red Rock to be hung.

1942
02:14:48,164 --> 02:14:50,375
Do you know why?

1943
02:14:50,542 --> 02:14:52,877
No.

1944
02:14:55,922 --> 02:14:58,049
$10,000.

1945
02:15:00,135 --> 02:15:03,262
That's why.

1946
02:15:03,430 --> 02:15:05,306
Now, when he gets here,

1947
02:15:05,473 --> 02:15:09,769
I'm gonna kill that fella
and turn my sister loose.

1948
02:15:09,936 --> 02:15:13,773
Now, do you have any reason
why you would want to interfere

1949
02:15:13,940 --> 02:15:16,859
with me saving my sister
from a hangman's rope?

1950
02:15:17,026 --> 02:15:19,286
- No.
- You don't?

1951
02:15:19,446 --> 02:15:22,164
- No, I don't.
- You sure you don't?

1952
02:15:22,323 --> 02:15:25,410
I mean, we did just kill
Minnie and Sweet Dave.

1953
02:15:26,536 --> 02:15:29,296
Now, you and Sweet Dave
looked mighty chummy over here.

1954
02:15:29,456 --> 02:15:32,299
I just met these people!
I don't give a damn about them!

1955
02:15:32,459 --> 02:15:34,669
Or you. Or your sister.

1956
02:15:34,836 --> 02:15:38,047
Or any other son of a bitch in Wyoming,
for that matter.

1957
02:15:38,214 --> 02:15:41,592
That is a good answer,

1958
02:15:41,759 --> 02:15:44,178
old man.

1959
02:15:44,345 --> 02:15:46,472
Now, when they get here,

1960
02:15:46,639 --> 02:15:49,600
you just sit your ass in this chair,

1961
02:15:49,767 --> 02:15:51,894
and you don't do nothin'.

1962
02:15:52,061 --> 02:15:56,615
You don't say nothin'.
"Hello." "Thank you." "Good night."

1963
02:15:56,774 --> 02:15:58,359
That's about it.

1964
02:15:58,895 --> 02:16:00,483
Maybe your name.

1965
02:16:01,154 --> 02:16:02,196
But that's it.

1966
02:16:02,363 --> 02:16:06,917
"Hello." "Thank you." "Good night."

1967
02:16:07,076 --> 02:16:09,412
- And maybe my name.
- Maybe your name.

1968
02:16:09,579 --> 02:16:12,582
Be a, be a old man.

1969
02:16:12,749 --> 02:16:16,385
Be dotty. Go to sleep.

1970
02:16:16,544 --> 02:16:19,130
And don't you say nothin',

1971
02:16:19,297 --> 02:16:21,340
and I mean nothin',

1972
02:16:21,508 --> 02:16:23,342
to that bounty hunter that's got my sister.

1973
02:16:23,510 --> 02:16:25,094
Do you understand?

1974
02:16:25,261 --> 02:16:26,597
Yes.

1975
02:16:28,640 --> 02:16:31,642
When it's safe, I'll kill him,

1976
02:16:31,809 --> 02:16:33,227
free my sister

1977
02:16:33,394 --> 02:16:35,772
and leave you be.

1978
02:16:38,191 --> 02:16:40,151
Deal?

1979
02:16:44,030 --> 02:16:45,740
Deal.

1980
02:16:45,907 --> 02:16:47,492
Thank you.

1981
02:16:48,910 --> 02:16:53,339
<i>During the next four hours, Jody and the boys
chucked the bodies down the well...</i>

1982
02:16:56,167 --> 02:16:58,169
<i>...put away the horses...</i>

1983
02:17:00,547 --> 02:17:02,257
<i>...tidied up around Minnie's...</i>

1984
02:17:04,551 --> 02:17:06,594
<i>...stashed weapons for further use...</i>

1985
02:17:10,974 --> 02:17:14,519
<i>...and waited for John Ruth
and Daisy's stage to arrive.</i>

1986
02:17:16,980 --> 02:17:18,481
All right, boys.

1987
02:17:18,648 --> 02:17:20,149
This is it.

1988
02:17:20,316 --> 02:17:22,026
Let's get ready.

1989
02:17:27,740 --> 02:17:29,534
Now, remember,

1990
02:17:29,701 --> 02:17:32,203
it doesn't matter
if we have four men or 40,

1991
02:17:32,370 --> 02:17:35,422
we are still gonna be facing John Ruth
chained to my sister

1992
02:17:35,582 --> 02:17:37,083
with a pistol pointed at her belly.

1993
02:17:37,250 --> 02:17:41,095
Now, killin' that fella
'fore he kills my sister ain't gonna be easy,

1994
02:17:41,254 --> 02:17:43,965
but you better believe
that's exactly what we gonna do.

1995
02:17:44,132 --> 02:17:47,301
So the name of the game here
is patience.

1996
02:17:47,468 --> 02:17:49,804
Trapped here for two or three days,

1997
02:17:49,971 --> 02:17:52,640
at some point he will close his eyes.

1998
02:17:52,807 --> 02:17:55,434
And that's when
you blow the top of his head off.

1999
02:17:55,602 --> 02:17:57,353
Remember, old man.

2000
02:17:57,520 --> 02:18:01,449
If my sister don't make it
off of this mountain alive, neither do you.

2001
02:18:01,608 --> 02:18:03,151
I'll do my best.

2002
02:18:10,700 --> 02:18:14,120
Easy.

2003
02:18:20,001 --> 02:18:21,504
Good luck, mate.

2004
02:18:33,806 --> 02:18:35,891
What the hell is going on?

2005
02:18:36,059 --> 02:18:38,144
We weren't expecting
another stage tonight!

2006
02:18:38,311 --> 02:18:39,895
- Yeah, I can see you
- Here.

2007
02:18:40,063 --> 02:18:41,314
already got another one up in here.

2008
02:18:41,481 --> 02:18:42,898
No.

2009
02:18:43,066 --> 02:18:45,318
Just got through puttin' the horses away!

2010
02:18:45,485 --> 02:18:47,862
Well, this ain't the normal line.

2011
02:18:48,029 --> 02:18:51,624
But we are stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,
so it looks like you're stuck with us.

2012
02:18:51,783 --> 02:18:55,419
- Now you gotta do another one.
- Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?

2013
02:18:55,578 --> 02:18:57,038
They ain't here!

2014
02:18:57,205 --> 02:19:00,166
I'm running the place while they're gone.

2015
02:19:00,333 --> 02:19:02,501
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?

2016
02:19:02,669 --> 02:19:05,171
He says they ain't here.

2017
02:19:05,338 --> 02:19:07,590
He's looking after the place
while they're gone.

2018
02:19:07,757 --> 02:19:09,509
Who are you?

2019
02:19:11,344 --> 02:19:14,597
I'm Bob.

2020
02:19:14,764 --> 02:19:19,268
Well, whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.

2021
02:19:21,354 --> 02:19:24,190
Get 'em out of this cold
'fore that blizzard hits us.

2022
02:19:24,357 --> 02:19:26,567
You all right?

2023
02:19:26,734 --> 02:19:29,870
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Esperate, esperate, esperate!

2024
02:19:30,029 --> 02:19:32,823
I just put those other horses away.

2025
02:19:32,990 --> 02:19:35,451
You need it done fast, you need to help.

2026
02:19:35,618 --> 02:19:37,995
I got two of my best men on it.

2027
02:19:39,539 --> 02:19:41,248
You heard him, freeloaders.

2028
02:19:41,416 --> 02:19:43,042
Get to work.

2029
02:19:43,209 --> 02:19:46,420
All right, you two, unhook the leaders.

2030
02:19:46,587 --> 02:19:49,298
Come on, let's go!

2031
02:19:49,465 --> 02:19:50,841
Open up!

2032
02:19:51,008 --> 02:19:52,551
- You have to kick it open!
- Ya gotta kick it open!

2033
02:19:52,719 --> 02:19:54,429
- What?
- Kick it open!

2034
02:20:26,919 --> 02:20:28,838
How you doin', old boy?

2035
02:20:30,173 --> 02:20:32,216
They shot my nuts off.

2036
02:20:32,383 --> 02:20:35,261
I'm freezin', burnin' up the same time.

2037
02:20:35,428 --> 02:20:38,139
Bleedin' like a stuck pig.

2038
02:20:38,306 --> 02:20:40,850
I think I'm gonna die.

2039
02:20:41,017 --> 02:20:42,977
And these motherfuckers did it.

2040
02:20:45,438 --> 02:20:47,231
That's how I'm doin'.

2041
02:20:47,398 --> 02:20:48,983
How you doin'?

2042
02:20:50,151 --> 02:20:53,320
Well, my leg hurts really bad.

2043
02:20:53,488 --> 02:20:56,657
But I think, if I put all my weight
on my right foot...

2044
02:20:56,824 --> 02:21:00,252
I was just bein' sarcastic.
I don't give a fuck about your leg.

2045
02:21:01,704 --> 02:21:04,039
Now, you just...

2046
02:21:04,207 --> 02:21:06,250
make yourself comfortable.

2047
02:21:06,417 --> 02:21:08,502
Don't worry about my comfort.

2048
02:21:08,669 --> 02:21:12,214
Shit, I can't feel my ass no more.

2049
02:21:12,381 --> 02:21:15,134
Worry about these owl hoots

2050
02:21:15,301 --> 02:21:20,765
and that bushwhackin' nut shooter
in the basement.

2051
02:21:20,932 --> 02:21:23,058
All right!

2052
02:21:23,226 --> 02:21:28,147
You... fella in the basement!

2053
02:21:28,314 --> 02:21:33,778
You either give up
by the time I count to three...

2054
02:21:33,945 --> 02:21:37,072
or I shoot Domergue in the head.

2055
02:21:37,240 --> 02:21:39,492
One!

2056
02:21:39,659 --> 02:21:41,202
Two!

2057
02:21:41,369 --> 02:21:44,747
No, no, no, no,
don't shoot her in the head!

2058
02:21:44,914 --> 02:21:46,290
I'm coming up.

2059
02:21:46,457 --> 02:21:50,044
Hold on now,
you bushwhackin' sack shooter!

2060
02:21:50,211 --> 02:21:53,806
You just open the door.
We tell you when to come up.

2061
02:21:58,261 --> 02:22:01,180
Now throw out your pistol.

2062
02:22:01,347 --> 02:22:03,307
Toward the bed.

2063
02:22:05,726 --> 02:22:08,854
Bet he got another.

2064
02:22:09,021 --> 02:22:11,607
Now throw out your other pistol.

2065
02:22:11,774 --> 02:22:13,234
I ain't got another pistol!

2066
02:22:13,401 --> 02:22:17,204
Well, you better shit another pistol
out your ass, 'cause if you don't throw one up here

2067
02:22:17,363 --> 02:22:20,449
in the next two seconds,
we gonna kill this bitch.

2068
02:22:23,411 --> 02:22:24,870
See?

2069
02:22:25,037 --> 02:22:27,122
Told you.

2070
02:22:27,290 --> 02:22:31,836
Now, with your hands
where we can see 'em,

2071
02:22:32,003 --> 02:22:36,465
slowly come on up.

2072
02:23:08,164 --> 02:23:10,541
How you doing, dummy?

2073
02:23:10,708 --> 02:23:15,379
Better, now I see your ugly face.

2074
02:23:22,011 --> 02:23:23,429
How you like that?!

2075
02:23:23,596 --> 02:23:25,347
You bushwhackin' castrator!

2076
02:23:25,514 --> 02:23:27,683
What are you doing?!
He was giving up!

2077
02:23:27,850 --> 02:23:30,227
It took him too long, so I done it for him.

2078
02:23:33,356 --> 02:23:37,652
Joe Gage, get your ass over here
and shut this trap door.

2079
02:23:57,630 --> 02:23:59,632
I'm sorry, honey.

2080
02:24:07,765 --> 02:24:09,600
May I sit in a chair?

2081
02:24:09,767 --> 02:24:12,436
Yes, you may-

2082
02:24:21,654 --> 02:24:24,073
Keep your hands flat on that table.

2083
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:26,158
And don't move 'em.

2084
02:24:26,325 --> 02:24:28,494
Mannix!

2085
02:24:28,661 --> 02:24:32,164
You sure picked the wrong time
to turn into a nigger lover.

2086
02:24:32,331 --> 02:24:35,843
Don't you see, that nigger and John Ruth
put you smack dab in the middle of danger?

2087
02:24:36,002 --> 02:24:38,596
You're about to be murdered
in some nigger named Minnie's house,

2088
02:24:38,754 --> 02:24:40,589
and you don't even know why!

2089
02:24:40,756 --> 02:24:44,426
Okay... bitch.

2090
02:24:44,593 --> 02:24:46,720
I'll bite.

2091
02:24:46,887 --> 02:24:48,180
Why?

2092
02:24:48,347 --> 02:24:50,933
I'm working with all three of them fellas.

2093
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:53,648
But not 'cause they got
butterflies in their belly about me,

2094
02:24:53,815 --> 02:24:55,896
but because we're all gang members.

2095
02:24:56,063 --> 02:24:58,273
The Jody Domingre Gang.

2096
02:24:58,441 --> 02:25:01,944
That fella y'all just killed in the basement

2097
02:25:02,111 --> 02:25:03,529
was Jody Domingre!

2098
02:25:03,696 --> 02:25:05,739
My brother!

2099
02:25:05,906 --> 02:25:10,202
Well, who the hell is Jody Domingre?

2100
02:25:10,369 --> 02:25:12,496
You want to tell him, bounty man?

2101
02:25:13,914 --> 02:25:17,751
He was a big bad cat worth $50,000.

2102
02:25:17,918 --> 02:25:21,880
And every member of his gang
was worth at least ten.

2103
02:25:22,048 --> 02:25:24,925
Which finally explains why you worth ten.

2104
02:25:25,092 --> 02:25:27,386
And what's gonna happen
when that sun comes out, nigger?

2105
02:25:27,553 --> 02:25:30,222
So is my brother's 15 men
coming straight here for us.

2106
02:25:30,389 --> 02:25:32,224
Tell him, Grouch!

2107
02:25:32,391 --> 02:25:34,685
Jody got 15 men waiting in Red Rock.

2108
02:25:36,353 --> 02:25:39,606
We couldn't kill John Ruth
and free Daisy here,

2109
02:25:39,774 --> 02:25:44,236
their job was to sack the town,
kill John Ruth

2110
02:25:44,403 --> 02:25:46,947
and free Daisy there.

2111
02:25:47,114 --> 02:25:50,576
Now, with my brother dead,
I'm in charge of this gang.

2112
02:25:50,743 --> 02:25:52,036
- Right, boys?
- That's right, Daisy.

2113
02:25:52,203 --> 02:25:53,078
Yeah.

2114
02:25:53,245 --> 02:25:54,997
And, Chris, I am telling you,

2115
02:25:55,164 --> 02:25:59,460
you ain't done anything yet
that we can't forgive.

2116
02:25:59,627 --> 02:26:01,420
So, let's make a deal.

2117
02:26:01,587 --> 02:26:03,005
No deals, bitch.

2118
02:26:03,172 --> 02:26:05,591
You gonna let that nigger
speak for you, Chris?!

2119
02:26:05,758 --> 02:26:09,428
Hold it, Warren.

2120
02:26:09,595 --> 02:26:12,514
Seeing as how
she ain't got nothing to sell,

2121
02:26:12,681 --> 02:26:16,643
I'm kinda curious about her sales pitch.

2122
02:26:16,811 --> 02:26:18,230
Humor me.

2123
02:26:19,146 --> 02:26:22,983
All right... bitch.

2124
02:26:31,534 --> 02:26:36,246
What's... your... deal?

2125
02:26:36,413 --> 02:26:38,373
Easy.

2126
02:26:38,541 --> 02:26:43,087
Take your gun, shoot that nigger dead.

2127
02:26:43,254 --> 02:26:47,049
Then we sit here all nice-like
for the next two days.

2128
02:26:47,216 --> 02:26:50,344
When the snow melts, we go to Mexico,
you go on to Red Rock,

2129
02:26:50,511 --> 02:26:52,471
get that star pinned on your chest.

2130
02:26:52,638 --> 02:26:55,599
Hey, Pete. How much can we pay him?

2131
02:26:55,766 --> 02:26:59,979
Well, we could give him Marco.

2132
02:27:01,647 --> 02:27:05,150
Bob's real name is Marco the Mexican.

2133
02:27:05,317 --> 02:27:07,736
He's worth $12,000.

2134
02:27:07,903 --> 02:27:10,072
That's Marco the Mexican?

2135
02:27:10,239 --> 02:27:12,032
Precisely, yeah.

2136
02:27:12,199 --> 02:27:13,826
Shit.

2137
02:27:13,993 --> 02:27:17,955
Now that I blowed his face off,
Marco ain't worth a peso.

2138
02:27:22,501 --> 02:27:25,254
Well, then, if I die in the next two days,

2139
02:27:25,421 --> 02:27:27,881
which is more than likely,
you can have me.

2140
02:27:28,048 --> 02:27:30,843
Under the name of English Pete Hicox,

2141
02:27:31,010 --> 02:27:35,264
I got a federal bounty
of $15,000 on my head.

2142
02:27:37,683 --> 02:27:39,309
It's all yours, Chris.

2143
02:27:39,476 --> 02:27:42,396
You keep talking, Pete,

2144
02:27:42,563 --> 02:27:46,275
you gonna talk yourself to death.

2145
02:27:46,442 --> 02:27:49,278
Joe Gage, who you be?

2146
02:27:49,445 --> 02:27:50,904
Grouch Douglass.

2147
02:27:52,740 --> 02:27:54,158
You heard of him?

2148
02:27:54,325 --> 02:27:56,618
Yeah, I heard of Grouch Douglass.

2149
02:27:56,785 --> 02:28:00,164
He worth ten, just like Daisy.

2150
02:28:00,331 --> 02:28:02,374
Well, remind me...

2151
02:28:02,541 --> 02:28:07,671
why we wouldn't just kill all y'all,
cash in.

2152
02:28:07,838 --> 02:28:11,049
You can kill us all,
but you'll never spend a cent

2153
02:28:11,217 --> 02:28:14,979
of that bounty money,
and you'll never leave this mountain alive.

2154
02:28:15,137 --> 02:28:17,431
'Cause when that snow melts,
the rest of Jody's gang,

2155
02:28:17,598 --> 02:28:21,602
all 15 of 'em that are waiting in Red Rock,
are coming here.

2156
02:28:21,769 --> 02:28:24,438
Now, l-let's say you shoot us all.

2157
02:28:24,605 --> 02:28:28,192
If you really want
all that Domingre Gang bounty money,

2158
02:28:28,359 --> 02:28:31,320
you still got to get all our corpses
into Red Rock.

2159
02:28:31,487 --> 02:28:33,614
And that ain't gonna be so easy.

2160
02:28:33,781 --> 02:28:35,991
'Cause I-I doubt you can drive
a four-horse team.

2161
02:28:36,158 --> 02:28:38,952
And that wagon out there
is too heavy for a two-horse team.

2162
02:28:39,119 --> 02:28:43,757
So that means you're gonna have to lead
a string of horses into Red Rock.

2163
02:28:43,916 --> 02:28:46,168
And with that deep snow after a blizzard,

2164
02:28:46,335 --> 02:28:50,764
you ain't gonna be able to get away
with any more than, say, one body per horse.

2165
02:28:50,923 --> 02:28:56,678
So that's you leading
a string of four horses into Red Rock.

2166
02:28:56,845 --> 02:29:00,307
And with all them horses in that snow

2167
02:29:00,474 --> 02:29:03,393
and you all by your lonesome,
you're gonna be a mite poky.

2168
02:29:03,560 --> 02:29:05,854
And you're gonna run
smack dab into the Domingre Gang.

2169
02:29:06,021 --> 02:29:07,896
And again, Grouch, how many is that?

2170
02:29:08,055 --> 02:29:14,238
- 15 killers strong.
- And when those 15 killers come across you

2171
02:29:14,405 --> 02:29:16,198
in possession of all our dead bodies,

2172
02:29:16,365 --> 02:29:18,700
they ain't just gonna kill
you and that nigger!

2173
02:29:18,867 --> 02:29:20,744
They gonna go back to Red Rock

2174
02:29:20,911 --> 02:29:24,331
and kill every son of a bitch
in that town!

2175
02:29:24,498 --> 02:29:26,333
You really the sheriff of Red Rock?

2176
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:28,543
You want to save the town?

2177
02:29:28,711 --> 02:29:30,464
Then shoot that nigger dead!

2178
02:29:31,630 --> 02:29:33,340
Jesus Christ!

2179
02:29:34,842 --> 02:29:37,135
You believe in Jesus now, bitch?

2180
02:29:37,303 --> 02:29:39,805
Well, good, 'cause you about to meet him.

2181
02:29:41,307 --> 02:29:43,183
Anybody else want to make a deal?

2182
02:29:43,350 --> 02:29:44,977
The deal still stands, Chris.

2183
02:29:46,729 --> 02:29:49,982
You ain't done nothing we can't forgive.

2184
02:29:50,149 --> 02:29:53,485
It's all still on that nigger.

2185
02:29:53,652 --> 02:29:56,738
You shoot him dead, take my body,

2186
02:29:56,905 --> 02:29:59,375
sit out in the snow with Daisy and Grou...

2187
02:29:59,533 --> 02:30:00,993
You cunt!

2188
02:30:44,244 --> 02:30:46,747
Mannix,

2189
02:30:46,914 --> 02:30:50,417
give me my pistol.

2190
02:30:51,502 --> 02:30:53,921
Give it here!

2191
02:30:58,884 --> 02:31:00,969
Give it here!

2192
02:31:14,191 --> 02:31:18,320
So, you were saying...

2193
02:31:18,487 --> 02:31:22,616
we sit here, all nice and friendly like,

2194
02:31:22,783 --> 02:31:24,451
for the next two days.

2195
02:31:24,618 --> 02:31:27,537
Then the snow melts, you leave here,

2196
02:31:27,704 --> 02:31:31,792
meet up with your gang,
and hightail it to Mexico.

2197
02:31:31,959 --> 02:31:34,002
That's the deal, right?

2198
02:31:34,169 --> 02:31:41,310
- Yeah.
- And I get Oswaldo and Joe Gage?

2199
02:31:41,468 --> 02:31:43,261
Yeah.

2200
02:31:43,429 --> 02:31:45,555
But Jody's worth $50,000.
What about his body?

2201
02:31:45,722 --> 02:31:50,310
You gonna make a deal

2202
02:31:50,477 --> 02:31:56,525
with this diabolical bitch?

2203
02:31:56,692 --> 02:31:59,453
I ain't saying I'm gonna
make a deal with her. We just talking.

2204
02:31:59,611 --> 02:32:02,781
Calm down!

2205
02:32:02,948 --> 02:32:05,659
So what about Jody's body
and the $50,000?

2206
02:32:05,826 --> 02:32:08,796
You're getting greedy, reb.
No deal.

2207
02:32:08,954 --> 02:32:11,674
We're taking Jody's body back with us.
He got children.

2208
02:32:14,751 --> 02:32:20,257
So I kill Warren, and we all friends?

2209
02:32:21,592 --> 02:32:23,427
Yeah.

2210
02:32:34,396 --> 02:32:36,398
No deal, tramp.

2211
02:32:36,565 --> 02:32:38,859
Chris!

2212
02:32:39,026 --> 02:32:41,653
You're making
the biggest mistake of your life!

2213
02:32:41,820 --> 02:32:45,458
When our boys get here in a couple of days,
they're gonna cut your nuts off!

2214
02:32:45,616 --> 02:32:49,077
And there won't be
a stick left in that town unburnt!

2215
02:32:49,244 --> 02:32:53,415
Well, I guess I should be
plumb scared right now?

2216
02:32:54,875 --> 02:32:57,836
If you had any brains, you would be!

2217
02:32:58,003 --> 02:32:59,755
You see...

2218
02:33:03,008 --> 02:33:04,885
...here's the problem, Daisy.

2219
02:33:05,052 --> 02:33:08,847
In order for me
to be scared of your threats,

2220
02:33:09,014 --> 02:33:11,850
I got to believe
in those 15 extra gang members

2221
02:33:12,017 --> 02:33:13,560
waiting it out in Red Rock.

2222
02:33:13,727 --> 02:33:18,190
And boy, I sure don't.

2223
02:33:20,442 --> 02:33:23,487
What I believe is,

2224
02:33:23,654 --> 02:33:29,451
Joe Gage or Grouch Douglass
or whatever the fuck his name was,

2225
02:33:29,618 --> 02:33:32,871
poisoned the coffee.

2226
02:33:33,038 --> 02:33:37,375
And you watched him do it.

2227
02:33:37,543 --> 02:33:42,005
And you watched me pour a cup,
and you didn't say shit!

2228
02:33:43,215 --> 02:33:44,591
And...

2229
02:33:44,758 --> 02:33:49,888
I believe you are
what you've always been,

2230
02:33:50,055 --> 02:33:54,309
a lying bitch who will do anything

2231
02:33:54,476 --> 02:34:00,241
to cheat the rope waiting for her in Red Rock,
including shitting out 15 extra gang members

2232
02:34:00,399 --> 02:34:03,026
whenever you need be.

2233
02:34:05,654 --> 02:34:08,073
And...

2234
02:34:11,159 --> 02:34:15,497
...I believe,
when it comes to what's left

2235
02:34:15,664 --> 02:34:20,919
of the Jody Domingre Gang,
I'm looking at 'em.

2236
02:34:21,086 --> 02:34:23,672
Right here, right now,

2237
02:34:23,839 --> 02:34:26,800
dead on this motherfucking floor!

2238
02:34:26,967 --> 02:34:28,677
Goddamn right.

2239
02:34:28,844 --> 02:34:32,931
Then you're gonna die
on this mountain, Chris.

2240
02:34:33,098 --> 02:34:36,309
'Cause my brother leads an army of men.

2241
02:34:36,476 --> 02:34:39,312
Horseshit!

2242
02:34:39,479 --> 02:34:42,274
My daddy led an army.

2243
02:34:42,441 --> 02:34:45,944
He led a renegade army,
fighting for a lost cause!

2244
02:34:46,111 --> 02:34:49,573
My daddy held up to 400 men together
after the war

2245
02:34:49,740 --> 02:34:54,035
with nothing but their respect
in his command!

2246
02:34:54,202 --> 02:34:57,122
Your brother's just an owl hoot
who led a gang of killers!

2247
02:35:00,334 --> 02:35:01,835
I don't feel so good.

2248
02:35:03,545 --> 02:35:05,255
Shit.

2249
02:35:15,807 --> 02:35:17,768
You still alive, white boy?

2250
02:35:18,894 --> 02:35:21,605
Fuck!

2251
02:35:26,026 --> 02:35:27,611
Mannix!

2252
02:35:27,778 --> 02:35:29,487
Fuck!

2253
02:35:29,655 --> 02:35:31,531
Hey, boy!

2254
02:35:38,789 --> 02:35:40,208
Get up!

2255
02:35:45,837 --> 02:35:47,339
Chris Mannix!

2256
02:35:47,506 --> 02:35:50,717
If your ass ain't nailed to the floor,
wake the fuck up!

2257
02:35:58,975 --> 02:36:00,936
Wake up, white boy!

2258
02:36:22,749 --> 02:36:25,585
I ain't dead yet, you black bastard.

2259
02:36:36,596 --> 02:36:41,434
Chris Mannix, I may have misjudged you.

2260
02:36:41,601 --> 02:36:44,563
Now we've come to the part of the story...

2261
02:36:47,482 --> 02:36:50,360
...where I blow your goddamn head off.

2262
02:36:50,527 --> 02:36:52,737
No! No, no, don't shoot her!

2263
02:36:52,904 --> 02:36:55,240
Why the hell not?

2264
02:36:55,407 --> 02:36:57,284
John Ruth.

2265
02:37:02,748 --> 02:37:08,879
Now, John Ruth
was one mighty, mighty bastard.

2266
02:37:14,134 --> 02:37:19,931
But the last thing
that bastard did 'fore he died

2267
02:37:20,098 --> 02:37:21,850
was save your life.

2268
02:37:22,017 --> 02:37:25,186
We gonna die, white boy.

2269
02:37:25,353 --> 02:37:27,063
We ain't got no say in that.

2270
02:37:29,775 --> 02:37:33,486
But there is one thing left
we do have a say in.

2271
02:37:33,653 --> 02:37:37,491
And that's how we kill this bitch.

2272
02:37:39,034 --> 02:37:41,786
And I say shooting's too good for her.

2273
02:37:41,953 --> 02:37:47,834
John Ruth could've shot her
anywhere anytime along the way.

2274
02:37:48,001 --> 02:37:52,881
But John Ruth was The Hangman.

2275
02:37:53,048 --> 02:37:54,966
And when The Hangman catches you,

2276
02:37:55,133 --> 02:37:58,636
you don't die by no bullet.

2277
02:37:58,804 --> 02:38:02,974
When The Hangman catches you,
you hang.

2278
02:38:03,141 --> 02:38:06,269
"You only need to hang mean bastards..."

2279
02:38:07,938 --> 02:38:11,483
"...but mean bastards, you need to hang."

2280
02:38:34,381 --> 02:38:38,176
As my first and final act

2281
02:38:38,343 --> 02:38:41,429
as the sheriff of Red Rock,

2282
02:38:41,596 --> 02:38:44,307
I sentence you, Domergue,

2283
02:38:44,474 --> 02:38:47,727
to hang by the neck until death!

2284
02:39:02,534 --> 02:39:04,327
Hang on, Daisy.

2285
02:39:04,494 --> 02:39:06,580
I want to watch.

2286
02:39:41,072 --> 02:39:44,075
Now, that was a nice dance.

2287
02:39:45,952 --> 02:39:49,039
That sure was pretty.

2288
02:39:53,543 --> 02:39:54,923
Shit!

2289
02:40:41,591 --> 02:40:43,093
Hey.

2290
02:40:45,136 --> 02:40:47,514
Can I see that Lincoln letter?

2291
02:41:30,306 --> 02:41:33,726
"Dear Marquis,

2292
02:41:33,893 --> 02:41:37,021
"I hope this letter finds you

2293
02:41:37,188 --> 02:41:41,442
"in good health and stead.

2294
02:41:41,609 --> 02:41:44,070
"I'm doing fine,

2295
02:41:44,237 --> 02:41:49,117
"although I wish
there were more hours in a day.

2296
02:41:49,284 --> 02:41:52,662
"There's just so much to do.

2297
02:41:52,829 --> 02:41:57,250
"Times are changing slowly but surely,

2298
02:41:57,417 --> 02:42:02,380
"and it's men like you
that will make a difference.

2299
02:42:02,547 --> 02:42:08,761
"Your military success
is a credit not only to you,

2300
02:42:08,928 --> 02:42:11,889
"but your race as well.

2301
02:42:12,057 --> 02:42:17,520
"I'm very proud
every time I hear news of you.

2302
02:42:17,687 --> 02:42:21,774
"We still have a long way to go,

2303
02:42:21,941 --> 02:42:28,406
"but hand in hand,
I know we will get there.

2304
02:42:28,573 --> 02:42:33,828
"I just want to let you know
you're in my thoughts.

2305
02:42:33,995 --> 02:42:39,292
"Hopefully,
our paths will cross in the future.

2306
02:42:39,459 --> 02:42:46,424
"Until then, I remain your friend.

2307
02:42:46,591 --> 02:42:49,510
"Ole Mary Todd's calling,

2308
02:42:49,677 --> 02:42:55,266
"so I guess it must be time for bed.

2309
02:42:55,433 --> 02:43:00,396
Respectfully, Abraham Lincoln."

2310
02:43:04,317 --> 02:43:06,527
"Ole Mary Todd."

2311
02:43:06,694 --> 02:43:08,988
That's a nice touch.

2312
02:43:09,155 --> 02:43:11,574
Yeah.

2313
02:43:11,741 --> 02:43:13,701
Thanks.
