1
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,707
- Mr. Szpilman?
- Hello.

2
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,450
I came specially to meet you.
I love your playing.

3
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:30,581
- Who are you?
- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.

4
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:33,284
- You're bleeding!
- It's nothing.

5
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:37,289
You can write him a fan letter later.
This isn't the best time. Come on.

6
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,790
Jurek, where have you been hiding her?

7
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:46,784
- I don't know what to take.
- You always take too much.

8
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,726
How many suitcases are you taking?

9
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,831
I'm packing my red dress.

10
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,434
And what, what do you think, should I,

11
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,978
should I take uncle Szymon's portrait?

12
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,078
Take it, don't take it,
take what you like.

13
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:02,457
- Can't you see I'm worried sick?
- He'll come home, he'll be alright.

14
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:03,851
We should have
another case just for shoes.

15
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,663
Wladek! Mama, Wladek's home!

16
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:11,077
Thank God. Wladek! You're wounded?

17
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:12,887
No, no, no,
it's a little cut, it's nothing.

18
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,578
I've been worried sick.

19
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:17,250
I told her not to worry.
You had your papers on you.

20
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,393
If you'd been hit by a bomb,
they'd have known where to take you.

21
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:20,578
Henryk, Henryk,

22
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,707
don't say things like...
don't say things like that.

23
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:24,684
- I can't find anything.
- God forbid. God forbid.

24
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,574
- Papa, Wladek's home.
- What did I tell you?

25
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:27,768
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like we're doing?

26
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,624
Has anybody seen
my hat with the wide brim?

27
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,783
I don't know they bombed us,
we're off the air.

28
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,619
Warsaw's not the only radio station.

29
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,541
Pack, pack, darling.
Get your things, pack.

30
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,992
- Where are we going?
- Pfff. Out of Warsaw.

31
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,824
- Out of Warsaw where?
- You haven't heard?

32
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,268
- Heard what?
- Haven't you seen the paper?

33
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:47,034
- Where's the paper?
- I used it for packing.

34
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,323
She used it for packing.

35
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:50,601
The government's moved to Lublin.

36
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,457
All able bodied men must leave the city,

37
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:55,462
go across the river and set up a new line
of defense, that's what it said.

38
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:58,989
There's hardly anybody left in this
building only the women the men have gone.

39
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,018
And what do you think you'll do while
you're setting up a new line of defense?

40
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:05,910
- Wonder around lugging your suitcases?
- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,914
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Good! I'm not going anywhere either!

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,367
Don't be ridiculous,
we've got to keep together.

43
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,458
No, no, look, look.

44
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:16,330
If I'm going to die, I prefer to die
in my own home, staying put.

45
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:19,330
- God forbid.
- Sssh! Shut up! I've got something listen.

46
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:22,409
<i>...from the BBC in London.</i>

47
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:29,823
<i>The British government... having received
no reply to the ultimatum presented...</i>

48
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,533
<i>to the German government...</i>

49
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:34,989
<i>has declared war on Nazi Germany.</i>

50
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,997
- That's wonderful! Wonderful!
- <i>It is expected that...</i>

51
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:46,579
<i>within the next few hours,</i>

52
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:49,580
<i>France will make a similar declaration.</i>

53
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,333
<i>Poland is no longer alone.</i>

54
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,532
My God!

55
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:00,785
It's great, great,
wonderful, wonderful!

56
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:06,122
- Mama, that was a great dinner.
- Yes, it certainly was.

57
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,226
Well when there's something to celebrate,
you've got to make an effort.

58
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,537
Here's to Great Britain and France!

59
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,163
I told you. Didn't I tell you?
All will be well.

60
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,991
Hey!

61
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:50,917
Five thousand and three.

62
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,167
Is that all?

63
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,075
Yes, five thousand and three zlotys,
that's all we've got left.

64
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,833
It's three thousand and three
zlotys too much. Look...

65
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:04,035
"Re: Further restrictions
regarding liquid assets.

66
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,451
Jews will be allowed to keep a maximum
of two thousand zlotys in their homes."

67
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:12,115
- What do we do with the rest?
- Deposit it in a bank. A blocked account.

68
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:16,206
Banks?! Who'd be stupid enough
to deposit money in a German bank?

69
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:21,287
We could hide the money. Look here. We can
hide the money under the flower pot.

70
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,367
No, no, no. I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll use try and tested methods.

71
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,040
You know what we did in the last war?

72
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:29,500
We made a hole in the table leg...

73
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,914
And we hid the money in there.

74
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,768
- And suppose they take the table away?
- What do you mean take the table away?

75
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:36,309
The Germans go into Jewish homes
and they just take what they want...

76
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,540
furniture, valuables, anything.

77
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,476
- Do they?
- Idiot! What would they want with a table.

78
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Hey? A table like this?

79
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,287
- What on earth are you doing?
- No, listen, look.

80
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,494
This is the best place for it.

81
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,574
No-one would think of looking
under the flowerpot.

82
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,059
No, no. No, no.
Listen, listen, I've been thinking...

83
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,414
Really? That's a change.

84
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,288
- You know what we do? We use psychology.
- We use what?

85
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,755
We leave the money
and the watch on the table...

86
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,616
and we cover it like this. In full view.

87
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,208
Are you stupid?

88
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,768
The Germans will search high and low,
I promise you, they'll never notice.

89
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:11,205
That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
Of course they'll notice it. Look.

90
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:15,660
Look here... Idiot.

91
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,536
And you call me stupid.

92
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,643
No, that is very good
because that is the last place...

93
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:22,184
- This would take hours.
- We are not in a hurry. We'd get it back.

94
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,184
- It won't take hours.
- How will you get them out? Tell me that!

95
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,101
Tell me that, I would like to know.
How would you get them out?

96
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,845
- Why do you resist?
- Quiet! Order, please!

97
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,809
- You take each one out individually.
- Order please!

98
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,313
No-one listens to me, no one listens.

99
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,371
Quiet, please, quiet!
Order, order, please!

100
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:38,365
- She's a lawyer, she likes order.
- Listen, just listen. Look,

101
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,746
the watch we put under the flowerpots
and the money we stuff in the violin.

102
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,490
Um...

103
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:48,661
- Will I still be able to play?
- Well, you'll find out.

104
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:53,247
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.
<i>- Wladek,</i> how are <i>you?</i>

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,287
Fine, fine, we're fine, thank you.
And you?

106
00:07:56,667 --> 00:08:00,991
<i>Fine, we're fine under the circumstances.
But I guess what you've called about.</i>

107
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,495
<i>There's nothing we can do.
They won't re-open the station.</i>

108
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,039
<i>Just won't re-open the station.</i>

109
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,124
Yes, I know, but um, Jurek...

110
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,620
<i>Not even music, nothing,
no radios for the Poles.</i>

111
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,539
I know, Jurek!

112
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,788
<i>But I'm sure you'll find work.
A pianist like you Wladek!</i>

113
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,370
Well, maybe, maybe not, but um...

114
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:21,156
listen, don't be offended, but I didn't
call to discuss my future career.

115
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:25,160
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,
and at last he gave in and said...

116
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,663
"All right, come with me tomorrow",
And so I came and...

117
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,661
they bombed the station.

118
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,820
I tell you, meeting you like that
was absolutely wonderful.

119
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:38,119
- Really?
- Yes, it was... It was unforgettable.

120
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,207
I've always loved your playing,
Mr. Szpilman.

121
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:42,327
Call me Wladek, please.

122
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:45,375
- No-one plays Chopin like you.
- I hope that's a compliment.

123
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:49,531
- Of course, I mean it.
- I was... trying to be funny.

124
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,241
Shall we go to the Paradiso,
have a coffee?

125
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,664
I'd like that.

126
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:59,406
- And you, what do you do?
- I finished with the conservatoire.

127
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,413
- You're a musician?
- Yes. But only just.

128
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,283
- What instrument?
- The cello.

129
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:07,328
I love to see a women playing the cello.

130
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:09,875
Here we are.

131
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,369
NO JEWS

132
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,496
This is disgraceful. How dare they?

133
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:18,851
You know what people are like,
they want to be better Nazis than Hitler.

134
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,573
- I'm going in there to complain.
- No. It's better not, believe me.

135
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:26,405
- It's so humiliating. Someone like you!
- Good-bye!

136
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,323
We'll find somewhere else.

137
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:36,250
- We can walk in the park.
- No, we can't.

138
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,451
It's an official decree.
No Jews allowed in the park.

139
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,867
- My God. Are you joking?
- I'm not joking, it's true.

140
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,122
I suggest we just sit on a bench somewhere
but that's another official decree,

141
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,698
"no Jews allowed on public benches".

142
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,539
This is absurd!

143
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,038
I'll tell you what we can do.
We can just stand here and talk.

144
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,624
I think we're allowed to do that,
don't you?

145
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:00,329
So, you play the cello Dorota.
That's nice.

146
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,826
And who's your favorite composer?
Chopin? Really? Well...

147
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:07,750
you'll have to learn to play
his cello sonata, won't you?

148
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,870
And what about you, Wladek? Well...

149
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,787
Perhaps I could accompany you.
Me on the piano, you on the cello.

150
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,618
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,
quite wonderful.

151
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,412
Call me Wladek, please.

152
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,996
"Re: Emblems for Jews
in the Warsaw district."

153
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,660
I hereby order that all Jews
in the Warsaw district...

154
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,742
will wear visible emblems
when out of doors.

155
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:38,082
This decree will come into force
on the 1st of December, 1939...

156
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:41,159
and applies to all Jews
over 12 years of age.

157
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,825
The emblem will be worn
on the right sleeve...

158
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:49,160
and will represent a blue star
of David on a white background.

159
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,905
The background must
be sufficiently large...

160
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,743
for the star to measure eight
centimeters from point to point.

161
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:01,039
The width of the arms of the star
must be one centimeter.

162
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:06,833
The Jews that do not respect this
decree will be severely punished.

163
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:12,032
"Governor of Warsaw district,
Dr. Fischer."

164
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,160
I won't wear it.

165
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,833
I won't wear it.
I'm not going to be branded.

166
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,706
Let, let me see this.

167
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:33,081
Does it say that we have to provide
these armbands ourselves?

168
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:36,784
- Where will we get them?
- We're not going to get them.

169
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,866
We're not going to wear them!

170
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,660
You!

171
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,911
Come here.

172
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,665
Why didn't you bow?

173
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,539
I beg your pardon.

174
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,537
You're forbidden to walk on the pavement.

175
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,240
Walk in the gutter!

176
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:40,240
- Have you seen this?
- What, what, what? I'm working. What?

177
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,331
What is it?

178
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,788
- That's where they're going to put us.
- What do you mean, put us?

179
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:54,656
"By order of the governor of the
Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer...

180
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,163
concerning the establishment of
the Jewish district in Warsaw.

181
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:02,076
There will be created a Jewish district
in which all Jews living in Warsaw

182
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,329
or moving to Warsaw will have to reside."

183
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:08,948
Look here. "Jews living outside
of the prescribed area"

184
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:14,287
will have to move to the Jewish
district by 31st of October, 1940."

185
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:20,123
They won't get all of us. It's too small.
There's 400 thousand of us in Warsaw.

186
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:23,159
No, 360 thousand. So it will be easy.

187
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:27,451
What am I supposed to do? You tell me.

188
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:29,909
You're a clever man,
you'll tell me what I will buy.

189
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I do my best.

190
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,458
Mama?

191
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,833
Mama, what is it?

192
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,708
20 zlotys!

193
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,413
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.

194
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:50,865
What, what can I buy with 20 zlotys?

195
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:56,243
I am sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.

196
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,790
That's the price.
That's what I'm offering.

197
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,742
My advice is to accept.
You won't get more from anyone else.

198
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,747
- But, it's a Bechstein, Mr. Lipa!
- Two thousand. My advice is to take it.

199
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,445
What are you going to do when
you're hungry? Eat the piano?

200
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,117
- Get out!
- Hey! What's the matter with you?

201
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,393
- Stop it!
- We'd rather give it away. Go on, get out!

202
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,875
Haven't you eaten today?
What you suffering from?

203
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,664
You people are crazy.

204
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:32,865
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand
and I'm paying for the removal.

205
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,744
I'm not even charging for the removal!

206
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,787
You haven't eaten today. You're crazy.

207
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,282
Take it.

208
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
Hello.

209
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,823
Hello. Hi.

210
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,411
I didn't want to come.

211
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,915
I didn't want to see all this, but...
I couldn't stop myself.

212
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,245
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

213
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,494
Good.

214
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,371
No, not really. They arrested my cousin.

215
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,244
Jurek says they'll let him out.

216
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,119
- This is disgraceful.
- It won't last long. Don't worry.

217
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,790
That's what I said myself.

218
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,706
It's too absurd.

219
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,291
I... I should go.

220
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,208
Well, I'll, I'll see you...

221
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,167
Soon.

222
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,119
Good-bye.

223
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,911
Well...

224
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:33,456
to tell you the truth,
I thought it would be worse.

225
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,914
- Where will we sleep?
- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

226
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,075
You, Henryk and papa, in here.

227
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:50,373
Look.

228
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,698
Come and look.

229
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,493
Go away. Go away! Go away!

230
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:36,080
Papa! Papa! Papa!

231
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:55,081
- Sell anything?
- Just one. Dostoievski, The <i>Idiot.</i>

232
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:57,909
- Three zlotys.
- It's better than yesterday.

233
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,324
Three lousy zlotys. And there are
people there making millions.

234
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:04,875
- I know.
- You don't know, believe me.

235
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,500
They bribe the guards,
the guards turn a blind eye.

236
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:13,748
They're bringing in cartloads of food,
tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

237
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,976
And the poor are dying all around
and they don't give a damn.

238
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,789
Excuse me, have you seen
my husband, Izaak Szerman?

239
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,118
A tall, a tall handsome man,
with a little gray beard... No?

240
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:29,040
- I'm afraid not.
- Excuse me. Good-bye.

241
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,823
Sleep well. But, but, but if you see him,
write to me, yes?

242
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:35,078
Izaak Szerman.

243
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,326
Why do we have to have a gentile
street running through our area?

244
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,249
Why can't they go around?

245
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,448
Don't worry about it. They're about
to build a bridge. Haven't you heard?

246
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,537
A bridge, a bridge a smedge.

247
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:06,250
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

248
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,621
But do you know what I think?
I think they are totally stupid.

249
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,655
I have a family to feed.
I spend half of my time here

250
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,707
waiting for them to let us through.

251
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,117
Maybe they think I come
here to listen to the music?

252
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:24,158
You're cold?

253
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,615
Dance!

254
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,287
- Dance!
- Dance!

255
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,913
Come on, come on! Dance!

256
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:03,948
Faster!

257
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,458
Good, they're here.

258
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,999
Yitzchak Heller's been waiting for you.

259
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,807
- What's this about?
- Sit down, have tea.

260
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,245
I'll start lunch
when the girls get here.

261
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,538
- So, what are you doing here?
- He brought cakes.

262
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:18,323
His... his father's back
in the jewelery business.

263
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,328
He's, doing well, hey, Yitzchak, hey?

264
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,741
Amazing, jewelery.

265
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,991
- We're recruiting.
- Who is recruiting?

266
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,283
Don't be clever with me, Henryk.
I'm coming as a friend.

267
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
They're bringing Jews
in from all over the country.

268
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,205
Soon there will be half million
people in the ghetto.

269
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:39,247
- We need more Jewish police.
- More Jewish police!

270
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:43,076
You mean you want me to beat up Jews with
my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit.

271
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,957
- I see!
- Someone's got to do it, Henryk.

272
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:45,827
But why me?

273
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,412
I thought you only recruited
boys with rich fathers.

274
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:50,829
Look at my father, look at us, I mean.

275
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,601
Yes, I'm looking at you,
that's why I'm here.

276
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,018
Your whole family can have a better life.

277
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:56,476
You want to go on struggling for survival,
selling books on the street?

278
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,615
Yes, please.

279
00:21:57,792 --> 00:22:00,454
I'm doing you people a favor.

280
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,874
What about you, Wladek?
You're a great pianist.

281
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,678
And we've got an excellent
police jazz band.

282
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,351
They'd welcome you with open arms.
Join us!

283
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,662
- You've got no work.
- Thank you, I've got work.

284
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,161
Yes of course!

285
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,324
I'm sorry, Wladek, he wants you to stop.

286
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,240
Who wants me to stop?

287
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,286
I always say,
look on the bright side.

288
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,913
You're in a small ghetto with
intellectuals, professional people.

289
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,743
You're better off than us.
Here in the large ghetto it's a cesspool.

290
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,198
Jehuda, give me something to do.

291
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:12,369
You're an artist, Wladek. You keep
peoples' spirits up. You do enough.

292
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:15,826
- I want to help, I want to do something.
- You're too well known, Wladek.

293
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:21,333
And you know what? You musicians
don't make good conspirators.

294
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:25,490
You're too... too... musical.

295
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,539
- Who is that?
- Symche.

296
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:33,740
Majorek.

297
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:39,205
There are notices going up.
City is to be cleansed of undesirables.

298
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:42,284
- No notices going up.
- Hello, Symche.

299
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:46,159
Dolek... Mrs. Zyskind.

300
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,370
Jehuda, working hard?

301
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:54,656
Majorek. This is the greatest pianist
in Poland. Maybe the whole world.

302
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,082
Wladyslaw Szpilman, meet Majorek.

303
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,791
- How do you do?
- I know your name.

304
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,537
- I've never heard you play.
- Majorek used to be in the Army.

305
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:07,785
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got
against him is he's not a socialist.

306
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:12,579
You better go now, Wladek.
It's nearly curfew.

307
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:16,579
You know how many copies
we print of our newspaper?

308
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,990
Five hundred.

309
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,197
You know how many people on
average read one copy? Twenty.

310
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:27,866
That makes ten thousand readers.
These will start the uprising.

311
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:31,155
Majorek hides them in his underpants
and leaves them in toilets.

312
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,824
- Toilets?
- As many toilets as I can find.

313
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,449
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

314
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:40,075
They're too clean for them.

315
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:48,204
Please, Mister, please, one zloty.

316
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:18,499
Hold it!
You little bastard!

317
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,240
Stop it! Stop it!

318
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:28,375
Stop it!

319
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:34,826
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on boy.

320
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:43,492
Stand up. Stand up. Stand up!

321
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:19,415
Please, tonight for once, I don't
want anything bad talked about.

322
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,788
- Enjoy our meal.
- Fine, then I'll tell you something funny.

323
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,768
You all know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?

324
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,240
- The surgeon.
- The surgeon.

325
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,536
Well, for some reason,
don't ask me why,

326
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,583
the Germans allowed him into
the ghetto to perform an operation.

327
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:34,955
On a Jew? They let a Pole
to come in to operate on a Jew?

328
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:38,285
He got a pass, that's all I know.
Anyway, so he...

329
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:40,707
he puts the patient to sleep
and starts the operation.

330
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,537
He'd just made the first incision
when the SS burst in...

331
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,615
shoot the patient lying on the table,

332
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:48,291
then Dr. Raszeja and everybody
else who was there.

333
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:51,417
Isn't that a laugh?

334
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:57,035
The patient didn't feel a thing,
he was anesthetized.

335
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,199
I said nothing bad, Henryk.

336
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:03,656
What's the matter with you all?
You lost your sense of humor?

337
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:05,869
It's not funny.

338
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:10,122
Well, you know what's funny?
You're funny, with that ridiculous tie.

339
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:14,538
What are you talking about my tie for?
What's my tie have to do with anything?

340
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:16,999
- I need this tie for my work.
- Your work?

341
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:19,283
- Yes, that's right, I work.
- Yes, yes, your work.

342
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:21,495
Playing the piano for all
the parasites in the ghetto.

343
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:22,789
- Parasites?
- Parasites.

344
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:24,244
Boys. Boys!

345
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,809
They don't give a damn
about people's sufferings.

346
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,473
And you blame me for their apathy, right?

347
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,332
I do because I see it every day.

348
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,297
They don't even notice
what's going around them.

349
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,457
- I blame the Americans.
- For what? For my tie?

350
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:36,245
The American Jews,
and there are lots of them.

351
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,643
What have they done for us, hey?
What do they think they're doing?

352
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,534
People here are dying.
Haven't got a bite to eat.

353
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,268
The Jewish bankers over there
should be persuading America

354
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:47,828
to declare war on Germany.

355
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,990
Lights! Lights!

356
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:01,667
Stand up!

357
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:07,537
You, stand up! Come on!

358
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,494
Throw him out!

359
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:27,080
Shhh. Shhh. Be quiet, Mama,
for God's sake, shhh, be quiet.

360
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:28,202
My God!

361
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:44,574
Matches! Matches!

362
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:50,289
- Excuse me!
- Yes!

363
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,743
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.
- Yes, come in. Not you!

364
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,117
- What's happened?
- My God, it's terrible.

365
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:18,666
- What?
- They're hunting people in the streets.

366
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:20,619
They've taken Henryk.

367
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:26,041
All right, go home, alright?
Go home, I'll take care of it.

368
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:41,664
Excuse me. Have you seen
my husband? Izaak Szerman?

369
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,744
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Tall, handsome, a little gray beard.

370
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:49,622
If you see him, write to me.
Don't forget. Izaak Szerman.

371
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:53,124
Faster, keep moving! Run!

372
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:00,664
What happened here?

373
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,323
They've got my grandson in there.
They pick them up, they take them away.

374
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:09,115
What they do to them,
I've stopped believing in God.

375
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,458
Excuse me. Excuse me.

376
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:14,990
Yitzchak?

377
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:20,991
Yitzchak? Yitzchak, here,
it's Wladek Szpilman!

378
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:25,577
Here!

379
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:30,620
- Henryk's in there.
- I haven't seen him.

380
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,870
- Believe me. They picked him up.
- Tough luck!

381
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,083
Can you help?

382
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:41,197
Now you need me, yes, now you need me!

383
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:42,490
Can you help us?

384
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,958
- It costs.
- I have no money.

385
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:47,956
Then there's nothing I can do.

386
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:49,922
You should've joined us
when you had the chance.

387
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:54,282
- Yitzchak they told me you had influence.
- Who told you?

388
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,117
People, people I know.
They said you're an important man.

389
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,750
Yitzchak!

390
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:22,114
- Who is this?
- Good morning Herr Rubinstein.

391
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:26,031
Good morning.

392
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:28,412
<i>Kaputt. Kaputt.</i>

393
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:35,410
- Want a cigarette?
- Cigarette?

394
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,116
Thank you.

395
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:06,580
Help! Help! Help! Help! A snatcher!
A snatcher! Help, help me!

396
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:02,572
- Why did they pick you up?
- So you go to Yitzchak Heller?

397
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,664
- Did I ask you to talk to him?
- You're out, aren't you?

398
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,617
Did you beg, did you grovel to
that piece of shit, that cockroach?

399
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:11,574
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help you.

400
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,573
What did you pay him?

401
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:17,954
With what, with what could I pay him?
With what?

402
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,204
Every zloty I earn we spend on food.

403
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:23,455
- I can look after myself.
- They were taking you away.

404
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:27,331
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's me they wanted, not you.

405
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:30,496
Why do you have to interfere
with other people's business?

406
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:33,059
You're mad. That's,
that's your trouble, is your mad.

407
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:34,994
That's also my business.

408
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:47,123
Hey, hey! What's the matter?
What's the matter? Are you sick?

409
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,206
Hungry.

410
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:56,491
Mr. Szpilman!

411
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:02,661
Employment certificate? What's that
mean, no employment certificate?

412
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:05,875
You have to have an
employment certificate...

413
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,746
to work for one of the German firms
in the ghetto, otherwise...

414
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:11,705
- Otherwise what?
- You'll be deported.

415
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:15,035
- So the rumors were true.
- They're going to resettle us...

416
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,829
and send us to labor camps, in the East.

417
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:23,666
- And they're closing the small ghetto.
- My God!

418
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:41,540
Wladek? Wladek?

419
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,494
I thought you'd be off on tour playing
London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

420
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:48,415
- Not this week.
- You look terrible.

421
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,583
Have you heard the rumors?
They're going to resettle us in the East.

422
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:56,706
Rumors! You take it all too much
to heart Wladek. What's the trouble?

423
00:37:57,125 --> 00:38:00,743
I, I've been trying to get the
certificate of employment for my father.

424
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,768
But I managed to get one for me
and the rest of my family,

425
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:05,226
but I need another one for my father.

426
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,024
- I've been to all the firms and shops...
- Why didn't you come to me?

427
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,832
I didn't know you were
in the certificate business.

428
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:12,578
I'm not, but Majorek is.

429
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,536
Can you help? I have no money.

430
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:21,072
Please, don't insult us.
Can you do something for him?

431
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:24,117
Be at the Schultz workshop tomorrow,
four o'clock.

432
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:27,080
You see what a wonderful piece
of luck you've had today?

433
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:31,115
That's the historical imperative
in action! That's why I always say:

434
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,745
- Look on the bright side!
- The bright side, yes, I know.

435
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:49,040
- How's your back?
- Better.

436
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Better?

437
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:53,203
Better not ask!

438
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:12,037
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

439
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:15,744
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

440
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,790
Well, at least we got work in the ghetto.
Hey?

441
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:33,157
At least we are still together.

442
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:50,287
All out! Into the yard!

443
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,789
We're all employed.
We've got work permits.

444
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:04,283
Wait.

445
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:06,042
Here.

446
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:08,579
Go over there. Hurry.

447
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:10,625
You.

448
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,332
You. You.

449
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,500
You.

450
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:20,990
You.

451
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:24,407
You.

452
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:37,660
The rest of you,
get dressed and report back here!

453
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,082
Bring your belongings, only 15 kilos!

454
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,162
Where are you taking us?

455
00:42:07,917 --> 00:42:09,373
I'm sorry, I did my best.

456
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:14,540
I thought the certificates would save us.

457
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:15,708
Stop it, Wladek.

458
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:19,285
Let's just hope that Henryk
and Halina will be better off.

459
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:44,865
Move on!

460
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,536
Come on, come on!

461
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,579
- Where will we be going?
- You're going to work.

462
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,739
You'll be much better off than
in the stinking ghetto. Move.

463
00:42:57,542 --> 00:43:01,365
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?

464
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:07,707
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?

465
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:11,491
Why did I do it?

466
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:21,870
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

467
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:25,908
Why did I do it?

468
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,037
I beg you,
don't you have a drop of water?

469
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:58,620
Don't you have a drop of water?
He's dying.

470
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,991
My child is dying of thirst.

471
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:02,869
- I beg you. I beg you.
- I'm sorry.

472
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:05,791
Don't you have a drop of water?
I beg you.

473
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:06,893
Did you hear what I'm saying?

474
00:44:06,917 --> 00:44:09,329
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.
- I can hear you.

475
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:12,018
We're letting them take us
to our death like sheep to the slaughter.

476
00:44:12,042 --> 00:44:13,908
- Not so loud.
- Why don't we attack them?

477
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:17,058
There's half a million of us here.
We can break out of the ghetto.

478
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:20,512
At least we can die honorably,
not as a stain on the face of history.

479
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,787
Why are you so sure they're
sending us to our death?

480
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:25,867
I'm not sure. You know why I'm not sure?
Because they didn't tell me.

481
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:28,143
But I'm telling you,
they're going to wipe us all out.

482
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:30,687
Dr. Ehrlich, what do you want me to do?
Do you want me to fight?

483
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:33,412
To fight, you need organization,
plans, guns.

484
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,413
He's right. What do you think I
can do? Fight them with my violin bow?

485
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:39,166
The Germans would never squander
a huge labor force like this.

486
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:41,878
They're sending us to a labor camp,
it's obvious.

487
00:44:41,917 --> 00:44:42,998
Sure.

488
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:46,416
Look at that cripple there,
look at the old people, the children.

489
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,500
They're gonna work?

490
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:51,288
Look at you! Well, you're going to carry
iron girders on your back?

491
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:37,117
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!

492
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:39,659
Halina! Henryk!

493
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:46,539
My God!

494
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:51,077
We heard you were here.
we wanted to be with you!

495
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:01,873
We wanted to be with you!

496
00:46:02,042 --> 00:46:05,330
Stupid. Stupid.

497
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:09,619
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?

498
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,745
She's getting on my nerves.

499
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:21,707
- What did she do, for God's sake?
- She smothered her baby.

500
00:46:23,958 --> 00:46:27,076
They prepared a hiding place
and of course they went there.

501
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:30,750
But the baby cried
just as the police came.

502
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:35,115
She smothered the cries with
her hands, the baby died.

503
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:39,996
A policeman heard the death rattle
and found where they were hiding.

504
00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:06,703
What are you reading?

505
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:15,078
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

506
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:17,374
If you poison us, do we not die?

507
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:20,333
And, if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?"

508
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:31,826
- Very appropriate.
- Yes. That's why I brought it.

509
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:52,416
Idiot. What's he think he's
gonna do with the money?

510
00:47:54,292 --> 00:47:57,080
Hey boy, come here.

511
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,073
Come here.

512
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,995
- How much for a caramel?
- Twenty zlotys.

513
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,742
What? For one caramel? What do you think
you're gonna do with the money?

514
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:08,119
Twenty zlotys.

515
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:12,866
We've got 20 between us.

516
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:14,869
I've got ten, I think.

517
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:20,040
Five, ten, twenty.

518
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:34,658
Why did I do it?

519
00:48:57,292 --> 00:49:02,037
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

520
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:46,791
- Halina?
- What?

521
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:51,705
- It's a funny time to say this, but...
- What?

522
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:54,957
I wish I knew you better.

523
00:49:59,292 --> 00:50:00,703
Thank you.

524
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:20,450
Szpilman? Szpilman!

525
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:28,496
Fuck off stupid! Go!

526
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:31,495
Papa? Papa?

527
00:50:32,292 --> 00:50:35,956
Papa? Mama? Halina?

528
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:38,995
Halina? Mama?

529
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:44,327
What do you think you're doing Szpilman?
I've saved your life. Get out just go! Go!

530
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:49,914
Don't run!

531
00:50:52,667 --> 00:50:57,161
Mama! Mama! Mama!

532
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:20,990
Well, off they go to the melting pot.

533
00:51:32,792 --> 00:51:35,159
What are you doing? She's pregnant!

534
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:03,702
Wladek?

535
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:25,156
Why are you here, Wladek?

536
00:54:26,042 --> 00:54:28,750
It's like this, I, I...

537
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:32,328
We...

538
00:54:34,625 --> 00:54:37,617
All of them, all of them.

539
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,164
All of them.

540
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:45,077
Perhaps they're lucky.
The quicker, the better.

541
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:48,330
It's not finished yet.
We'll stay here for a couple of days,

542
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:50,119
until things die down.

543
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:53,375
I've bribed a policeman,
he'll come when it's over.

544
00:55:14,417 --> 00:55:17,739
My God, I haven't been outside in,
it must be two years.

545
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:19,665
Don't get overexcited.

546
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:39,910
It's gold. Very good price.

547
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:01,993
Someone you know?

548
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:04,783
A beauty. Who is she?

549
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:09,201
She's a singer. I knew her well actually.
Her husband's an actor.

550
00:56:09,542 --> 00:56:12,125
They're good people.
I'd like to talk to her.

551
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:15,075
Don't forget, Wladek.
They hang them for helping Jews.

552
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,618
- Stop!
- Halt!

553
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:55,244
How long have you been here?

554
00:58:56,417 --> 00:58:57,703
Since last night.

555
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:01,078
I was pleased to see you.

556
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,949
They're going to start
the final resettlement now.

557
00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:12,578
We know what it means.

558
00:59:14,667 --> 00:59:18,240
We sent someone out.
Zygmunt, a good man.

559
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:23,120
His orders were to follow
the trains out of Warsaw.

560
00:59:25,667 --> 00:59:26,953
He got to Sokolow.

561
00:59:28,042 --> 00:59:30,659
A local railway man told
him the tracks divided,

562
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:32,908
one branch leading to Treblinka.

563
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:38,531
He said everyday freight trains
carrying people from Warsaw...

564
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:41,697
branched off to Treblinka
and returned empty.

565
00:59:43,042 --> 00:59:45,158
No transports of food
are ever seen on that line.

566
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:50,163
And civilians are forbidden
to approach the Treblinka station.

567
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:55,865
They're exterminating us.

568
01:00:00,542 --> 01:00:02,158
It won't take them long.

569
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:07,575
We're 60 thousand left,
out of half a million.

570
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:10,494
Mostly young people.

571
01:00:12,792 --> 01:00:14,624
And this time we're gonna fight.

572
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:18,990
We're in good shape.

573
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:23,826
Organized. We're prepared.

574
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,415
If you need help, I...

575
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:49,621
You! Come here!

576
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:52,125
Shit!

577
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:02,999
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

578
01:01:03,542 --> 01:01:05,954
I, I don't know what I was thinking.

579
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,199
Get him away from here.

580
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:56,701
I hope you play the piano better
than you carry bricks.

581
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:01,540
He won't last long
if he goes on like this.

582
01:02:01,917 --> 01:02:04,534
I'll see if I can get him
something better.

583
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:28,536
Trouble.

584
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:32,041
Assemble! Fall in!

585
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:34,996
Round up! Only the Jews.

586
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:38,822
Poles go on working.
Only the Jews!

587
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,583
I have good news for you.

588
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:54,241
There are rumors going around
that we like to...

589
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:57,246
<i>umsiedeln...</i> Resettle you.

590
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:04,157
I promise you that now
and in the future...

591
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:07,159
nothing else is planned.

592
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:15,660
Ja? For this reason, we put
information posters on the wall.

593
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:20,326
To show you our goodwill...

594
01:03:20,417 --> 01:03:24,490
you should vote one of you
to be allowed...

595
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:27,371
to go in town daily...

596
01:03:28,042 --> 01:03:34,084
and bring three kilos
of Kartoffeln potatoes, ja?

597
01:03:34,417 --> 01:03:38,536
And one loaf of bread
for each of your workers.

598
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:44,328
So, why should we do something else
like this if we would resettle you?

599
01:03:45,625 --> 01:03:50,995
You can make good business
out of the things you don't eat.

600
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:58,079
Isn't that something that you Jews
are good in? Make money?

601
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:03,206
Carry on.

602
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:23,531
That one, with the string.
The others, tied by wire.

603
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:33,375
Now!

604
01:06:11,042 --> 01:06:12,077
Majorek.

605
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,332
I have a favor to ask.

606
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:19,453
I want to get out of here.

607
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:27,949
It's easy to get out. It's how you
survive on the other side that's hard.

608
01:06:28,042 --> 01:06:29,042
I know.

609
01:06:30,917 --> 01:06:35,161
Last summer, I worked for a day
in the Zelazna Brama Square.

610
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:37,867
I saw someone I knew,
she's an old friend.

611
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:41,120
A singer, her husband's an actor.

612
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,198
I filled their names down
and their address, if they're still there.

613
01:06:48,292 --> 01:06:52,456
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki.
They're good people.

614
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:55,953
Would you try to make contact?

615
01:06:58,250 --> 01:06:59,250
You go to town every day.

616
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:03,327
Would you just ask them, ask them
if they'd help me get out of here?

617
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,866
Got a plaster?

618
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:51,040
What are you up to?

619
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:55,661
What's in that?

620
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,663
We're allowed to take food
into the ghetto.

621
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:02,957
Three kilos of potato and bread.

622
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:04,990
Open it.

623
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:11,120
It's only potatoes and bread.

624
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:14,405
You're lying. I can smell it.

625
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:17,331
Open it.

626
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:47,414
Potatoes!

627
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:54,367
You Jews are all the same.

628
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:58,291
Give a Jew your little finger...

629
01:08:58,833 --> 01:09:00,995
and he takes the whole hand.

630
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:19,331
Lie to me again,
I'll shoot you... personally.

631
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:44,999
I tried your friends.

632
01:09:45,917 --> 01:09:48,750
- They don't live there anymore.
- Did you make contact?

633
01:09:50,167 --> 01:09:52,374
- Be ready to leave.
- When?

634
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:54,119
- Soon.
- Halt!

635
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:57,912
Shit! Shit!

636
01:10:10,917 --> 01:10:14,205
I'll teach you discipline, you dirty pigs!

637
01:10:19,292 --> 01:10:20,999
Know why we're beating you?

638
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:22,375
No.

639
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:24,408
Know why we beat you?

640
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:28,576
- Why?
- To celebrate New Year's Eve.

641
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:34,124
No, quick march! March!

642
01:10:34,667 --> 01:10:36,783
March and sing!

643
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,115
Sing something cheerful!

644
01:10:40,167 --> 01:10:42,249
Sing it loud and clear!

645
01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:47,740
<i>♪ Hey ranks unite
and follow the white eagle ♪</i>

646
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:51,997

651
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:00,164
I'm sorry.

652
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:03,038
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

653
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:30,832
We haven't much time. Come on.

654
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:40,414
We must hurry.

655
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,615
Here. See if these fit.

656
01:13:43,625 --> 01:13:45,286
We're going to have to keep moving you.

657
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:47,950
The Germans are hunting
down indiscriminately now.

658
01:13:48,042 --> 01:13:51,239
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

659
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:55,327
And Wladek, you'd better shave.
Use my razor on the shelf.

660
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:12,287
You'll be looked after
by Marek Gebczynski.

661
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,957
He's on the other side of town.

662
01:14:15,542 --> 01:14:18,159
You stay there tonight,
then we'll find you somewhere else.

663
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:23,621
- I'll bring you food.
- Alright, let's go.

664
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,707
I'll show you where
you're going to sleep.

665
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,708
You have to stay here
until tomorrow afternoon.

666
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:44,790
We have a flat for you near
the ghetto well. But it's safe.

667
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:54,412
It's not going to be very comfortable.

668
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:56,417
I'll be fine.

669
01:16:06,958 --> 01:16:08,164
Thank you.

670
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,367
I'll take it. Here. Give it to me.

671
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:31,413
Go as near to the front as possible,
to the German section.

672
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:51,744
DO NOT PASS

673
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,286
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

674
01:17:31,542 --> 01:17:34,534
But you leave them open
during the daytime. Don't forget.

675
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:41,038
Must feel better on
this side of the wall?

676
01:17:41,792 --> 01:17:42,792
Yes.

677
01:17:44,542 --> 01:17:47,739
But sometimes I'm still not sure
which side of the wall I'm on.

678
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:53,955
Some bread, potatoes, onions.

679
01:17:54,792 --> 01:17:58,330
I'll come again. And Janina Bogucki
will visit twice a week.

680
01:17:58,417 --> 01:18:00,499
Bring more food, see how you are.

681
01:18:01,292 --> 01:18:02,373
Thank you.

682
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:09,123
This is very important.
In case of emergency...

683
01:18:09,208 --> 01:18:12,701
I mean emergency,
go to this address.

684
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:58,412
<i>Puppy dog, what</i> do you mean you <i>forgot?</i>

685
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,911
<i>What do you think I mean, Kitten?</i>

686
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,582
<i>I forgot, that's what I mean.</i>

687
01:19:01,667 --> 01:19:04,159
<i>You know what, you treat me like dirt.</i>

688
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:07,117
<i>I treat you
like dirt because you are dirt.</i>

689
01:19:07,292 --> 01:19:09,784
<i>- Pig! Pig!
- Bitch!</i>

690
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:12,750
<i>- Dirty pig!</i>
- You are <i>a dirty ply!</i>

691
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:14,824
<i>Takes one to know one. Ply.</i>

692
01:19:19,625 --> 01:19:22,162
<i>You play like an angel, Kitten.</i>

693
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:24,090
<i>If I play like an angel,
why don't you listen?</i>

694
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:26,198
I <i>was listening, Kitten.</i>

695
01:19:26,292 --> 01:19:29,739
<i>Liar!
You fell asleep. Ply!</i>

696
01:22:42,292 --> 01:22:43,292
Thank you.

697
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,788
- I wanted to come earlier, but...
- No, no, no, thank you.

698
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:57,412
No-one thought
they'd hold out so long.

699
01:22:58,708 --> 01:23:01,476
I never should have come out. I should've
stayed there and fought with them.

700
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:04,947
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

701
01:23:05,042 --> 01:23:07,079
Just be proud it happened.

702
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:11,701
- My God, did they put up a fight!
- Yes.

703
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:16,375
- So did the Germans.
- They're in shock!

704
01:23:16,792 --> 01:23:22,162
They didn't expect it.
Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back?

705
01:23:22,708 --> 01:23:26,656
- Who would have thought?
- What good did it do?

706
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:29,073
What good?

707
01:23:29,958 --> 01:23:31,619
Wladek, I'm surprised at you.

708
01:23:32,542 --> 01:23:35,000
They died with dignity,
that's what good it did.

709
01:23:36,167 --> 01:23:37,287
And you know something else?

710
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:41,872
Now the Poles will rise. We're ready.

711
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:45,530
We'll fight too. You'll see.

712
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:03,159
Get your things together.
You have to leave.

713
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:05,617
What? What's happened?

714
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:10,541
- I'm on the run.
- What's happened?

715
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:14,619
The Gestapo found our weapons.
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

716
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:19,744
They're bound to find out about this
place too. You must get away at once.

717
01:24:19,917 --> 01:24:21,123
Where do you want me to go?

718
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:24,996
Look at me, I'm not leaving.

719
01:24:26,792 --> 01:24:29,534
- Can I take my chances here?
- That's your decision.

720
01:24:30,375 --> 01:24:33,288
But when they storm the flat,
throw yourself out the window,

721
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:34,831
don't let them get you alive.

722
01:24:35,292 --> 01:24:37,750
I have poison on me.
They won't get me alive either.

723
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,115
Open up!

724
01:27:59,792 --> 01:28:02,329
Open this door
at once or we'll call the police!

725
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:35,781
Are you from this flat?
You're not registered.

726
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:37,018
It belongs to a friend of mine.

727
01:28:37,042 --> 01:28:39,454
I just came to visit,
but I must have just missed him.

728
01:28:39,542 --> 01:28:41,158
Have you got your identity card?

729
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:42,333
What?

730
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:44,585
- Let me see your identity card.
- Yes, of course.

731
01:28:47,958 --> 01:28:50,620
- I want to see your identity card!
- What's happening?

732
01:28:50,708 --> 01:28:52,995
He's a Jew! A Jew!

733
01:28:53,583 --> 01:28:55,449
Stop the Jew!

734
01:28:56,917 --> 01:28:59,329
Don't let him out! Stop him!

735
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:16,448
- Yes?
- Mr. Gebczynski sent me.

736
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:27,164
- Wladyslaw Szpilman.
- Dorota.

737
01:30:28,458 --> 01:30:29,869
Come in.

738
01:30:37,375 --> 01:30:39,537
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

739
01:30:39,625 --> 01:30:42,788
I was given this address
and I'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.

740
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:45,833
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.

741
01:30:46,792 --> 01:30:47,998
Come in.

742
01:30:56,458 --> 01:30:57,573
Sit.

743
01:31:01,417 --> 01:31:02,782
I need help.

744
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:06,948
He'll be back before curfew.

745
01:31:07,458 --> 01:31:10,246
I've... I've been in hiding.

746
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,413
- I need somewhere to stay.
- He'll be here soon.

747
01:31:18,167 --> 01:31:21,239
- How long have you been married?
- Just over a year.

748
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:26,165
And... how's Jurek?

749
01:31:26,917 --> 01:31:28,078
Dead.

750
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:38,572
- And when, when is your baby due?
- Christmas.

751
01:31:39,708 --> 01:31:41,699
This is not a good time to have children,

752
01:31:41,792 --> 01:31:43,499
but then...

753
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:49,323
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman.

754
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:53,581
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.
- Yes, I remember.

755
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:58,912
Mr. Gebczynski said to contact you
only in case of emergency.

756
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Don't worry now.

757
01:32:10,042 --> 01:32:13,160
We can't move you tonight.
You'll sleep on the sofa.

758
01:32:18,083 --> 01:32:19,869
Excuse me.

759
01:32:24,458 --> 01:32:26,790
I'm sorry, could I,
could I have a piece of bread?

760
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:29,619
Yes, of course. We'll eat.

761
01:32:31,125 --> 01:32:33,913
Sit. Please, sit.

762
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:36,323
Thank you.

763
01:34:45,042 --> 01:34:46,828
You're in a very German area.

764
01:34:48,292 --> 01:34:51,785
The building opposite is a hospital
taking in wounded from the Russian front.

765
01:34:54,458 --> 01:34:56,574
And next door is the Schutzpolizei.

766
01:34:59,208 --> 01:35:00,698
Safest place to be.

767
01:35:01,708 --> 01:35:03,665
Right in the heart of the lion's den.

768
01:35:09,708 --> 01:35:11,073
I'll be locking you in.

769
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:15,576
No-one knows you're here,
so keep as quiet as possible.

770
01:37:25,333 --> 01:37:26,333
All well?

771
01:37:28,208 --> 01:37:29,208
Thank you.

772
01:37:34,833 --> 01:37:37,666
This is Antek Szalas.
He'll be looking after you.

773
01:37:38,792 --> 01:37:40,072
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

774
01:37:40,625 --> 01:37:41,786
Thank you.

775
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:47,290
I've given him a second key. He'll
bring you food, see that you're alright.

776
01:37:48,167 --> 01:37:50,283
He's with the underground,
he's a good man.

777
01:37:54,833 --> 01:37:59,122
- You don't remember me Mr. Szpilman?
- I don't think so.

778
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:02,621
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician.

779
01:38:03,292 --> 01:38:05,329
I saw you almost every day.

780
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:10,041
- I'm sorry, I don't remember, I...
- It doesn't matter.

781
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:15,868
You've nothing to worry about.
I'll visit often.

782
01:38:17,292 --> 01:38:20,034
You'll be pleased to hear that
the Allies are bombing Germany...

783
01:38:20,125 --> 01:38:22,116
night after night, after night.

784
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:25,117
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.

785
01:38:25,208 --> 01:38:28,621
And the Russians are really giving
them hell. It's the beginning of the end.

786
01:38:28,708 --> 01:38:29,914
Let's hope so.

787
01:39:16,625 --> 01:39:17,911
Still alive then?

788
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:26,744
Here. Sausage, bread.

789
01:39:26,833 --> 01:39:28,449
You still got that vodka?

790
01:39:43,333 --> 01:39:46,871
- How long is this meant to last?
- Not long now.

791
01:39:48,208 --> 01:39:50,415
I think, I think I've got jaundice.

792
01:39:51,458 --> 01:39:55,201
Don't worry about that.
It just makes you look funny.

793
01:39:56,542 --> 01:39:59,864
My grandfather was jilted by
his girlfriend when he got jaundice.

794
01:40:00,708 --> 01:40:01,708
Drink up.

795
01:40:03,417 --> 01:40:06,660
Why didn't you come sooner?
It's been over two weeks.

796
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:07,990
- I got...
- Problems.

797
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:10,912
Money.

798
01:40:11,333 --> 01:40:13,324
I've got to raise money to buy the food.

799
01:40:14,042 --> 01:40:17,080
I need things to sell,
it's not easy.

800
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:23,912
Here. Sell this.

801
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:28,787
Food's more important than time.

802
01:40:34,208 --> 01:40:37,405
Yes. I meant to tell you!
The Allies have landed in France.

803
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:39,366
Russians will be here soon.

804
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:42,332
They'll beat the shit
out of the Germans...

805
01:40:44,083 --> 01:40:45,494
any day now.

806
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:30,952
Wladek?

807
01:41:36,458 --> 01:41:37,458
Wladek?

808
01:41:41,208 --> 01:41:44,246
I knew it. I knew this would happen.

809
01:41:46,542 --> 01:41:48,954
- I'll get a doctor.
- You can't. It's too dangerous.

810
01:41:49,042 --> 01:41:51,955
- I'll get Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.
- Dorota. Don't be ridiculous,

811
01:41:52,042 --> 01:41:52,952
he's a pediatrician.

812
01:41:53,042 --> 01:41:55,033
- He's still a doctor.
- No.

813
01:41:55,792 --> 01:41:58,250
You stay. I'll go.

814
01:42:31,708 --> 01:42:33,574
We came to say goodbye.

815
01:42:34,792 --> 01:42:37,750
We're going to stay
with my mother in Otwocks.

816
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,037
The baby's already there. It's safer.

817
01:42:41,458 --> 01:42:44,450
There's talk that the uprising
will begin any day now.

818
01:42:46,833 --> 01:42:49,370
That man Szalas should be shot.

819
01:42:50,750 --> 01:42:54,323
He's been collecting money
on your behalf all over Warsaw.

820
01:42:55,833 --> 01:43:00,532
Apparently people gave generously,
so he collected a tidy sum.

821
01:43:04,708 --> 01:43:06,198
My God.

822
01:43:11,083 --> 01:43:14,997
The liver the size of a football.
Acute inflammation of the gall bladder...

823
01:43:16,708 --> 01:43:17,948
but he'll live.

824
01:43:21,625 --> 01:43:25,118
I'll try to get him some levulose,
but it's not easy.

825
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,288
- Can you visit him again?
- Who knows.

826
01:43:29,833 --> 01:43:33,827
- Doctor, thank you.
- Don't speak, rest.

827
01:43:37,167 --> 01:43:38,783
Thank you so much for coming.

828
01:43:41,875 --> 01:43:43,240
We've brought you some food.

829
01:43:43,833 --> 01:43:46,996
I'll prepare something now for you,
then we must go.

830
01:46:52,167 --> 01:46:54,374
Get out, get out,
get out into the streets!

831
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,118
Get out now! The Germans
have surrounded the building!

832
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:43,618
Somebody... Somebody!
somebody help me!

833
01:48:58,167 --> 01:49:01,080
Heinrich?

834
02:02:02,708 --> 02:02:04,494
What are you doing here?

835
02:02:09,542 --> 02:02:11,203
Who are you?

836
02:02:15,917 --> 02:02:19,239
- Understand?
- Yes.

837
02:02:21,625 --> 02:02:23,457
What are you doing?

838
02:02:28,333 --> 02:02:31,075
I, I was...

839
02:02:31,708 --> 02:02:34,200
trying to open this can.

840
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:37,082
Do you live here?

841
02:02:40,583 --> 02:02:42,665
Do you work here?

842
02:02:42,750 --> 02:02:44,036
No.

843
02:02:48,083 --> 02:02:49,665
What do you do?

844
02:02:53,625 --> 02:02:54,786
I am...

845
02:02:57,042 --> 02:02:59,249
I was a pianist.

846
02:03:02,125 --> 02:03:03,456
Pianist?

847
02:03:23,042 --> 02:03:24,407
Come on.

848
02:03:50,167 --> 02:03:51,657
Play something.

849
02:09:11,250 --> 02:09:12,911
Are you hiding here?

850
02:09:18,958 --> 02:09:20,073
Jew?

851
02:09:23,333 --> 02:09:24,664
Where are you hiding?

852
02:09:27,750 --> 02:09:28,750
In the attic.

853
02:09:32,583 --> 02:09:33,664
Show me.

854
02:09:58,292 --> 02:09:59,578
Got any food?

855
02:12:11,167 --> 02:12:12,532
Jew!

856
02:12:27,250 --> 02:12:28,615
Excuse me. Please.

857
02:12:29,208 --> 02:12:31,370
What's all that gunfire?

858
02:12:32,083 --> 02:12:34,199
Russians. Across the river.

859
02:12:36,125 --> 02:12:39,288
All you have to do is wait a few weeks.

860
02:14:10,833 --> 02:14:13,700
- What's happening?
- We're leaving.

861
02:14:16,542 --> 02:14:19,614
- Are the Russians here?
- Not yet.

862
02:14:22,792 --> 02:14:26,706
I... I don't know how to thank you.

863
02:14:28,167 --> 02:14:29,953
Thank God, not me.

864
02:14:30,792 --> 02:14:36,367
He wants us to survive.
Well, that's what we have to believe.

865
02:14:46,167 --> 02:14:48,659
Here. Take it.

866
02:14:50,583 --> 02:14:53,120
- And you?
- I've got another...

867
02:14:53,208 --> 02:14:54,824
a warmer one.

868
02:14:59,542 --> 02:15:02,000
What'll you do when it's all over?

869
02:15:04,667 --> 02:15:09,161
I'll play the piano again.
On the Polish radio.

870
02:15:09,875 --> 02:15:11,491
Tell me your name.

871
02:15:11,875 --> 02:15:13,741
I'll listen out for you.

872
02:15:14,708 --> 02:15:15,948
Szpilman.

873
02:15:17,208 --> 02:15:18,208
Szpilman.

874
02:15:21,333 --> 02:15:23,370
Good name for a pianist.

875
02:16:46,167 --> 02:16:49,125
German! German!

876
02:17:10,208 --> 02:17:11,698
No! No!

877
02:17:12,167 --> 02:17:14,659
No! Don't shoot! I'm, I'm Polish!

878
02:17:14,833 --> 02:17:16,574
Please! I'm Polish!

879
02:17:17,375 --> 02:17:18,536
I'm...

880
02:17:18,625 --> 02:17:19,956
Come out with your hands up!

881
02:17:20,125 --> 02:17:21,125
Please! I beg of you!

882
02:17:21,833 --> 02:17:26,623
Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot.
I beg you, I'm a Polish, please.

883
02:17:26,792 --> 02:17:28,499
Come down!

884
02:17:32,375 --> 02:17:36,824
Please, I'm Polish! Please... please.

885
02:17:36,917 --> 02:17:37,998
He's Polish.

886
02:17:41,708 --> 02:17:43,745
Yes, he's Polish.

887
02:17:45,250 --> 02:17:46,786
Why the fucking coat?

888
02:17:48,750 --> 02:17:50,411
I'm cold.

889
02:18:10,208 --> 02:18:12,575
Look at them. German fuckers!

890
02:18:13,750 --> 02:18:16,538
Murderers! Murderers!

891
02:18:17,167 --> 02:18:20,285
- Dirty bastards!
- Assassins!

892
02:18:20,375 --> 02:18:23,367
- Bastards!
- Look at you now!

893
02:18:24,083 --> 02:18:27,906
You took everything I had.
Me, a musician.

894
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:31,322
You took my violin, you took my soul!

895
02:18:36,208 --> 02:18:37,619
Musician?

896
02:18:39,083 --> 02:18:40,164
Musician?

897
02:18:41,250 --> 02:18:42,115
Yes.

898
02:18:42,208 --> 02:18:46,907
Do you know a pianist named Szpilman?

899
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:48,365
Polish radio?

900
02:18:48,542 --> 02:18:50,283
Of course I know him.

901
02:18:50,458 --> 02:18:54,372
I helped him when
he was in hiding. Tell him I'm here.

902
02:18:54,458 --> 02:18:58,156
Ask him to help me.

903
02:19:02,042 --> 02:19:03,203
What's your name?

904
02:19:03,375 --> 02:19:04,911
Hosenfeld.

905
02:19:05,083 --> 02:19:08,405
What?

906
02:20:48,583 --> 02:20:50,449
It was here, I'm certain of it.

907
02:20:53,042 --> 02:20:54,658
Well, it's not here now.

908
02:20:55,417 --> 02:20:58,955
I shouted, abuse at them.
I'm not proud of it but that's what I did.

909
02:20:59,833 --> 02:21:01,574
And I'm certain
I stood where you are now.

910
02:21:01,958 --> 02:21:05,246
There was barbed wire,
and this German came up to me.

911
02:21:07,167 --> 02:21:09,909
- You didn't catch his name?
- No.

912
02:21:12,875 --> 02:21:15,037
I'll ask at the factory.
They may know something.
