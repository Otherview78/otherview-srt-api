<i>This is the Persian empire...</i>

2
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,376
<i>...known today as Iran.</i>

3
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:47,339
<i>For 2500 years, this land was ruled
by a series of kings...</i>

4
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,049
<i>...known as shahs.</i>

5
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,721
<i>In 1950, the people of Iran elected
Mohammad Mosaddegh...</i>

6
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,266
<i>...a secular democrat, as prime minister.</i>

7
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,687
<i>He nationalized British and U.S.
petroleum holdings...</i>

8
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,815
<i>...returning Iran's oil to its people.</i>

9
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,776
<i>But in 1953...</i>

10
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:12,573
<i>...the U.S. and Great Britain engineered
a coup d'état that deposed Mosaddegh...</i>

11
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,742
<i>...and installed Reza Pahlavi as shah.</i>

12
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,497
<i>The young shah was known
for opulence and excess.</i>

13
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,542
<i>His wife was rumored to bathe in milk...</i>

14
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,629
<i>...while the shah had his lunches
flown in by Concorde from Paris.</i>

15
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,465
<i>The people starved.</i>

16
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,971
<i>The shah kept power through his ruthless
internal police:</i>

17
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,889
<i>The SAVAK.</i>

18
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,643
<i>An era of torture and fear began.</i>

19
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,316
<i>He then began a campaign
to westernize Iran...</i>

20
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:52,112
<i>...enraging a mostly traditional Shiite
population.</i>

21
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,075
<i>In 1979, the people of Iran
overthrew the shah.</i>

22
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:03,206
<i>The exiled cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini,
returned to rule Iran.</i>

23
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:11,173
<i>It descended into score-settling,
death squads and chaos.</i>

24
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:18,138
<i>Dying of cancer,
the shah was given asylum in the U.S.</i>

25
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,727
<i>The Iranian people took to the streets
outside the U.S. embassy...</i>

26
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,480
<i>...demanding that the shah be returned...</i>

27
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,981
<i>...tried...</i>

28
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,275

The prime minister won't let
the embassy be taken over.

163
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,881
<i>Our embassy has been seized...</i>

164
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:05,053
<i>...and more than 60 American citizens
continue to be held as hostages.</i>

165
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:09,223
<i>The situation in Iran this morning
is unchanged in regard to the hostages.</i>

166
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,602
<i>NBC's situation in Iran has changed,
however.</i>

167
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,359
- Is he back there?
- Office.

168
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,281
What happened?

169
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,242
The six of them went out a back exit.

170
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,912
Brits turned them away,
Kiwis turned them away.

171
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,789
Canadians took them in.

172
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,999
Traffic calls them "The Houseguests."

173
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,294
They haven't left the Canadian
ambassador's house since it happened.

174
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,671
- Why didn't we get them 10 weeks ago?
- Too dangerous.

175
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,300
You got Revolutionary Guards going
door-to-door like Jehovah's Witnesses.

176
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,762
Half of them think that Khomeini's been
too lenient on the ones in the embassy.

177
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,389
What about the White House?

178
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,183
Carter's shitting enough bricks
to build the pyramids.

179
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,393
The Canadians are done.

180
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,230
They say they're bearing too much risk. Their
foreign secretary corners Vance in Brussels...

181
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,941
...and told him she wants
the six of them out.

182
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,652
- Who else knows?
- Just the families.

183
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,530
Meanwhile, some genius in our embassy
was keeping a mug book...

184
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,574
- ...on everybody who worked there.
- Jesus Christ.

185
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,910
We think it got shredded
before they got in.

186
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:15,123
But now the bastards are using sweatshop
kids to reassemble the shreds.

187
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,001
And once they reassemble that book
they'll know six Americans got out.

188
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,753
And they'll know what they look like.

189
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,297
Standing room only
for beheadings in the square.

190
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:27,051
- Who's handling?
- State is coordinating in-house.

191
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,345
State?

192
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,806
- They don't do exfils.
- They do now.

193
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,434
They want to run it by us,
strictly as consultants.

194
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,644
Engell says it's a lose-lose.

195
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,523
These people die, they die badly. Publicly.

196
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,692
State wants the blame, we'll give it to them.

197
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,486
What does he want me here for?

198
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,448
So he can tell State
he ran it by his best exfil guy.

199
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,456
Okay.

200
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,375
This is Bob Pender from State O.S.

201
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,419
He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff.

202
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,963
- Bob?
- Thank you.

203
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,798
All right.

204
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,842
Mark and Cora Lijek.

205
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,429
<i>Twenty-nine and 25. He's a consular officer,
she's an assistant.</i>

206
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,016
<i>Newlyweds. They only just got there
a couple months ago.</i>

207
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,312
No language skills or in-country knowledge.

208
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,857
Henry Lee Schatz.
Agricultural attaché from Idaho.

209
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,817
<i>A bit of an oddball, apparently.</i>

210
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,196
<i>He was there to sell
U.S. tractors to Iranian agro.</i>

211
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,948
Joe Stafford. Late 20s.

212
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,992
<i>He's smart and a climber.</i>

213
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,243
<i>Speaks Farsi.</i>

214
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,246
<i>He arranged the hire of his wife, Kathy.</i>

215
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,708
Embassy was understaffed,
so the faculty wives were the typing pool.

216
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,419
And Bob Anders. Senior consular officer...

217
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,172
<i>...oldest of the group
and most likely to be group leader.</i>

218
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,217
They're in hiding at the Canadian
ambassador's residence.

219
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:53,179
Fortunately, we do not believe the Iranians
are aware the six have escaped.

220
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,433
So, what we like for this are bicycles.

221
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,229
We've identified back roads
from the Shemiran district.

222
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,731
A couple of rat lines
through the mountains...

223
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,191
...to the crossing near Tabriz.

224
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,236
Cars are off the table
because of the roadblocks.

225
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,946
We wait till the weather clears up...

226
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,491
...then deliver the six bikes, provide them
with maps to the Turkish border.

227
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,285
We have intelligence they can ride bicycles.

228
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,413
Or we're prepared to send in
somebody to teach them.

229
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,424
Or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with Gatorade.

230
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,051
Tony.

231
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,220
It's 300 miles to the Turkish border.

232
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,806
They'd need a support team
following them with a tire pump.

233
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,350
We were just asked to sharpshoot this.

234
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,893
State is handling the op.

235
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,311
I'm sorry, who is this?

236
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,899
Tony's an exfil spesh. He got a lot
of the shah's people out after the fall.

237
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,652
Sir, if these people can read or add...

238
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,863
...pretty soon they're gonna figure out
they're six short of a full deck.

239
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,034
It's winter. You can't afford to wait around till
spring so it's nice enough to take a bike ride.

240
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,788
The only way out of that city is the airport.
Build new cover identities for them...

241
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,916
...you send in a Moses,
he takes them out on a commercial flight.

242
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,919
- We've explored those options.
- They'll never get past airport control.

243
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,630
- Komiteh own the place.
- They could pose as reporters.

244
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,841
- The government issued 70-something...
- Seventy-four.

245
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,593
...visas for American journalists.

246
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,761
The Revolutionary Guards
keep them on 74 leashes.

247
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,807
If they're caught with fake journalist creds,
it's Peter Jennings' head in a noose in an hour.

248
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,101
North American accents
gives us limited options.

249
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,270
So we get the Canadians
to issue them passports.

250
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,856
What about English teachers
at the international school?

251
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,692
It's a good idea, but that school's been
closed for eight months.

252
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,485
Okay, so how about the do-gooders?

253
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,782
Six Canadians have been over there inspecting
crops, making sure the kids get enough to eat.

254
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,493
We give them creds,
makes them look like Ag NGOs.

255
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,788
It's a Feed the Kids thing. Okay?

256
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,624
Those kids are black.

257
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,500
Those are African kids.

258
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,879
- We get ethnically appropriate kids.
- Are there starving kids in Iran?

259
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,715
I'm sure there's some skinny kids
in Iran, so...

260
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,718
- What about missionaries?
- A logo with seeds. Call it "Seeds of Hope."

261
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:56,927
Hold on.

262
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,640
Sir, do you have this newspaper in front
of you? Would you mind taking a look at it?

263
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,893
What's in this picture?

264
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,312
- Tehran.
- Right. What's on the ground?

265
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,149
- Snow.
- Right.

266
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,569
So, what crops are the do-gooders
inspecting under Frosty?

267
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,325
Sir, exfils are like abortions.

268
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,160
You don't wanna need one...

269
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,163
...but when you do, you don't do it yourself.

270
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,753
You have a better plan?

271
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,172
No, sir.

272
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,303
<i>Whatever
the conflicting signals from Iran today...</i>

273
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,888
<i>...and for that matter, every day...</i>

274
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:44,100
<i>...about whether the hostages will
or will not be tried as spies...</i>

275
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,978
<i>...the government of the United States
has not deviated from its basic demand:</i>

276
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,272
<i>The hostages must be freed.</i>

277
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,275
- -Claims to defend human rights,
it not only does not defend them...

278
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,195
...it violates them for all nations.

279
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,571
<i>We demand extradition...</i>

280
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,197
<i>We demand extradition...</i>
U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN

281
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:58,364
U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN

282
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:02,451
<i>...of a man who, for more than 37 years, with the
United States' support...</i> 
U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN

283
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:02,743
<i>...of a man who, for more than 37 years,
with the United States' support...</i>

284
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,497
<i>...has killed months-old babies
in the arms of their mothers.</i>

285
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,376
<i>He said if the Americans try
military force to rescue the hostages...</i>

286
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,255
<i>...the students will kill them all
and blow up the embassy.</i>

287
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,384
<i>Americans were outraged at Iran
and anyone Iranian.</i>

288
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,387
<i>Before that decision was taken,
there was a demonstration in Houston.</i>

289
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,305
<i>An Iranian flag was burned...</i>

290
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,309
<i>...when anti-Iranian demonstrators
gathered near the Iranian consulate.</i>

291
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,730
<i>also is what led to a decision
to scrutinize the visas of Iranians...</i>

292
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,774
They knew exactly what was going to happen.
They knew.

293
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,444
But I don't understand
what they should do now.

294
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,196
Send him back,
just to be tortured and killed?

295
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,741
I don't think that justice is the worst thing.

296
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,702
<i>When did people first tell you that torture
was going on in Iran?</i>

297
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:48,789
<i>They would never come to me and say,
"Well, sir, we have tortured this fellow."</i>

298
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,710
<i>President Sadat of Egypt,
he calls you, Imam--</i>

299
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,212
<i>Forgive me, his words, not mine.</i>

300
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,547
- <i>-A lunatic.</i>

301
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,717
Why didn't he have a choice?
Why do you think he didn't have a choice?

302
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,218
He would've been referred to as a barbarian.

303
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,096
That's why they're saying
that their current regime...

304
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,723
The shah did more for women's rights--

305
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,018
I think you'd better--
Please, everyone, get into the crawlspace.

306
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,413
<i>At one point,
the mob cornered one of the Iranians.</i>

307
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,000
<i>When he tried to protect himself,
this is what happened.</i>

308
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,960
<i>Just hit him again!</i>

309
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,631
<i>We're not gonna take it anymore!
We're sick of it!</i>

310
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,050
<i>America!</i>

311
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:46,847
<i>Even in our little community here, I mean,
people are drawn up tight, they're tense.</i>

312
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:51,060
<i>They shouldn't even let those students
in that embassy there.</i>

313
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:54,438
<i>Just shoot a couple of them,
show them we mean business.</i>

314
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,775
<i>Men who served in Vietnam
for what they believed was right are angry.</i>

315
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,026
<i>I'm mad as hell.</i>

316
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:03,948
<i>I'm like the guy screaming on that movie
program in</i> Network, <i>you know? I've had it.</i>

317
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,701
<i>And if need be, I'll bear arms again.</i>

318
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:11,497
<i>And that's the way it is
Wednesday, January 16th, 1980.</i>

319
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,918
<i>The 74th day of captivity
for 50 Americans in Iran.</i>

320
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,428
- Hello?
<i>- Buddy man.</i>

321
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,055
I'll get Mom.

322
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,723
I'm looking for you.

323
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,185
<i>Did you do your homework tonight?</i>

324
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,105
- Yeah, it was easy.
- <i>Excellent. What are we watching?</i>

325
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,357
<i>Battle for the Planet of the Apes.</i>

326
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,859
Tell me, what channel is it on?

327
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,277
Five.

328
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,365
All right.

329
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,537
- What'd you do at school today?
- <i>Nothing. I don't know. Nothing.</i>

330
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,958
Can't be nothing.
Something must've happened.

331
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,960
<i>After school I got some baseball cards.</i>

332
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,545
- Mm-hm.
- <i>That was fun.</i>

333
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,023
<i>Okay, you know those
science-fiction movies?</i>

334
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,817
<i>Star Trek, Star Wars.</i>
They need an exotic location to shoot.

335
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,445
Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know.

336
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:25,905
Now, imagine this:

337
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:31,327
They're a Canadian film crew
on a location scout for a science-fiction movie.

338
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,995
We put it out there--

339
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,955
The Canadian producers put it out there.

340
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,749
- -That we're looking at Egypt, Istanbul.

341
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,421
Then we go to the consulate and say,
"Hey, we wanna look at Iran too."

342
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:47,134
I fly into Tehran, we all fly out together
as a film crew. Done.

343
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:50,512
Flamboyant cover identities should be avoided,
as it increases operational visibility.

344
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,724
This is more plausible than foreigners
who wanna go be teachers in Iran.

345
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:56,393
You wanna blend in with the population,
you don't look like a rodeo clown.

346
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,271
Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning
and be in the movie business?

347
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,273
We already have credentials
for the teachers.

348
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,233
- No, sir, we have a contact in L.A.
- Chambers.

349
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,527
John Chambers.
He's a Hollywood prosthetics guy.

350
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:09,657
He's got an Oscar, he did <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>
Did a bunch of contract work for us in the past.

351
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,452
I go see him, he sets us up.
One, two days, make it look real.

352
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:32,638
I went outside for 30 seconds. Could you
give me a break? I can't breathe in this house.

353
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,808
- I need some fresh air. I can't breathe.
- Stay inside the fucking house.

354
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,811
- Who saw me go outside? I'm just curious.
- That's not the point, Bob.

355
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,230
- It doesn't matter who saw you go out.
- Did you see me?

356
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,732
- No.
- I did, okay? I saw you.

357
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,902
Bob, it only takes one second
for them to spot you.

358
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,909
KHALKALl:
Some Americans are missing.

359
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,245
Look at the repaired list of embassy employees.

360
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,331
The numbers don't match.

361
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,418
Finish assembling the pictures from the embassy.

362
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,129
All I need is their faces and I will find them.

363
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,047
Yes, sir, it will be done.

364
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,769
We want you to go to L.A.

365
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,398
If you can make the movie thing credible,
we'll take you to the director.

366
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,275
Don't fuck up.

367
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,902
The whole country is watching you.

368
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,155
They just don't know it.

369
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,580
<i>My creation.</i>

370
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,750
My creation.

371
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,090
What the fuck, Brian?

372
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,467
- Cut.
- We're cutting.

373
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,844
- What an idiot.
- It really hurt.

374
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,220
I'm sorry.

375
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,348
Chambers. John Chambers, makeup!

376
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:04,313
Burbank, CALIFORNIA - January 19, 1980

377
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:14,073
He says the Minotaur prosthetic
is too tight, so he can't act.

378
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,992
If he could act, he wouldn't
be playing the Minotaur.

379
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,583
Mr. Chambers?

380
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,668
Kevin Harkins.

381
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:29,963
Hey, Tony.

382
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,280
Watch your head.

383
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,366
What are you shooting?

384
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,409
Monster movie.

385
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,578
Yeah? Any good?

386
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,040
Target audience will hate it.

387
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,708
Who's the target audience?

388
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,460
People with eyes.

389
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,381
Talk to me.

390
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,717
It's an exfil.

391
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,052
From where?

392
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,638
Worst place you can think of.

393
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,181
Universal City.

394
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,731
How are you gonna get into the embassy?

395
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,235
They're not in the embassy.
During the takeover, six people escaped.

396
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,237
They're hiding out in Tehran.

397
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,699
- And that's who I'm gonna go get.
- What am I making?

398
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,577
I need you to help me make a fake movie.

399
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,246
Heh. You came to the right place.

400
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,583
I wanna set up a production company
and build a cover around making a movie.

401
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,751
- That we're not gonna make.
- No.

402
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,671
So you wanna come to Hollywood
and act like a big shot?

403
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,798
- Without actually doing anything?
- No.

404
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,550
You'll fit right in.

405
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:03,932
Let's see.

406
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,978
Well, this one's got an M.A. in English.
She should be your screenwriter.

407
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:11,064
Sometimes they go along on scouts
because they want the free meals.

408
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,941
Here's your director.

409
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,277
Can you teach somebody
to be a director in a day?

410
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,779
You can teach a rhesus monkey
to be a director in a day.

411
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:21,783
Look, if you're gonna do this,
you gotta do it.

412
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,244
The Kho-maniacs are Froot Loops,
but they got cousins...

413
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,622
...who sell prayer rugs
and eight-tracks on La Brea.

414
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,751
You can't build cover stories
around a movie that doesn't exist.

415
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:33,086
You need a script. You need a producer.

416
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,421
- Make me a producer.
- No.

417
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,925
You're an associate producer at best.

418
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,637
If you're gonna do a $20 million
<i>Star Wars</i> rip-off...

419
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,641
...you need somebody who's a somebody
to put their name on it.

420
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,726
Somebody respectable.

421
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,145
With credits.

422
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,815
Who you can trust
with classified information.

423
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,027
Who'll produce a fake movie.

424
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,071
For free.

425
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,171
Hi. I only got a couple of minutes.
I'm getting a lifetime achievement award.

426
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,923
- <i>Mazel tov,</i> Lester.
- Ah.

427
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,592
I'd rather stay home and count
the wrinkles on my dog's balls.

428
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,847
Okay, you got six people hiding out
in a town of, what, 4 million people...

429
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,685
...all of whom chant "Death to America"
all the livelong day.

430
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,436
You want to set up a movie in a week.

431
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,023
You want to lie to Hollywood,
a town where everybody lies for a living.

432
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,693
Then you're gonna sneak 007 over here...

433
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,363
...into a country that wants CIA blood
on their breakfast cereal...

434
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,033
...and you're gonna walk the Brady Bunch
out of the most watched city in the world.

435
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,953
Past about a hundred militia
at the airport. That's right.

436
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,872
Right.

437
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,376
Look, I gotta tell you.

438
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:58,505
We did suicide missions in the Army
that had better odds than this.

439
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,132
Sir, the car is here.

440
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,809
You ever think, Lester,
how this is all for the cameras?

441
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:14,021
Well, they're getting the ratings,
I'll say that for--

442
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,826
We're gonna need a script.

443
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,920
Here, come on, come on, come on.

444
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,255
- No, it's fine.
- Stop.

445
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,596
Okay.

446
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:58,857
I love you.

447
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,786
Sahar, how are you doing?

448
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,246
Fine, thank you.

449
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,708
Your friends from Canada, ma'am.

450
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,545
All this time. They never go out.

451
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,644
Sahar knows.

452
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,441
How about <i>The Horses of Achilles?</i>

453
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,069
No good. Nobody does Westerns anymore.

454
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:48,407
- It's ancient Troy.
- If it's got horses in it, it's a Western.

455
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,616
Hey, Kenny, please.

456
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,160
Yeah, it's John Chambers,
about the office space.

457
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,788
It doesn't matter. It's a fake movie.

458
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:58,458
If I'm doing a fake movie,
it's gonna be a fake hit.

459
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,254
<i>The cardinal wants
all cover options on his desk Friday morning.</i>

460
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,674
Engell's prepping the bikes option,
the teachers option.

461
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,136
You have 72 hours to make yours better.

462
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,846
Fine.

463
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,458
Hey, is A006 still on the open list?

464
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,126
Yeah, I'll hold.

465
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:45,630
"Fade in on a starship landing.
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe.

466
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,551
Women gather, offering ecstatic
libations to the sky gods.

467
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:53,180
<i>Argo.</i> A science-fantasy adventure."

468
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,558
- It's in turnaround. It's dog shit.
- It's a space movie in the Middle East.

469
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,351
- Does it matter?
- Can we get the option?

470
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,021
Why do we need the option?

471
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:05,066
You're worried about the Ayatollah?
Try the WGA.

472
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,320
Just let me do the talking.

473
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,740
I've known this guy for 25 years.
He's full of shit and he comes on hard...

474
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,575
...but I can handle him.

475
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,038
You want to go into production
with this in one month?

476
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,831
Up like a carny ride.

477
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,041
One month, yeah.

478
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,585
- Who are you again?
- Kevin Harkins. Studio Six Films.

479
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,128
He's the money.

480
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:30,383
Look, what do you say 15 thou
and let's close on this?

481
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,095
You want me to be honest with you, Les?

482
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,723
No. I would like you to bullshit me, Max.

483
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,391
All right.

484
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,269
I enjoyed your films. The early ones.

485
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:45,565
I took this meeting out of respect,
because I wanted to say no to your face.

486
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,610
Thank you. Very respectful.

487
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,278
You're finished, Lester.

488
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,697
Get your cataracts fixed, read the trades.

489
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,451
MGM just capitalized for six new films.

490
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,079
They're screaming for sci-fi.

491
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,457
They're offering me four times
what you guys are offering me.

492
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:07,420
Well, what can I say?

493
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,214
Congratulations.

494
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,927
But, see, it kind of worries me,
what you said, and let me tell you why.

495
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:18,848
Couple of weeks ago, I was sitting at
Trader Vic's, I was enjoying a Mai Tai...

496
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,725
...when my pal Warren Beatty comes in.

497
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,978
He wishes me well, we had a little chat.

498
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,439
Seems he was attached
to star in <i>Zulu Empire...</i>

499
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,817
...which was gonna anchor that MGM slate.

500
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,070
But Warren confided in me
that the picture's gone over budget...

501
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,156
...because the Zulu extras wanna unionize.

502
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,909
They may be cannibals,
but they want health and dental...

503
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,369
...so the movie's kaput.

504
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,747
Which means that the MGM deal
ain't gonna happen...

505
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,750
...and your script ain't worth
the buffalo shit on a nickel.

506
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,169
So the way it looks to me--

507
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,171
Through the cataracts, I grant you.

508
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,132
- -Is that you can either sign here...

509
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,302
...and take $10,000
for your toilet paper script...

510
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,679
...or you can go fuck yourself.

511
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,599
With all due respect.

512
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,440
You really know Warren Beatty?

513
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:12,360
Yes, I do. I took a leak next to him
once at the Golden Globes.

514
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,321
Taco?

515
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,840
Got any kids, Lester?

516
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,052
Yeah. I have two daughters.

517
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,721
You see them much?

518
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,806
I talk to them once a year.

519
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,934
- Maybe.
- Why is that?

520
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,440
I was a terrible father.

521
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,528
The bullshit business,
it's like coal mining.

522
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,990
You come home to your wife and kids,
you can't wash it off.

523
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,243
You?

524
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,080
Yeah, I got a son.

525
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,458
He lives in Virginia with his mother.

526
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,047
You're divorced?

527
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,049
Taking time off.

528
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,261
He needs to be, you know...

529
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,471
...where he is.

530
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,934
Kids need the mother.

531
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,320
They caught the shah's chief of security
trying to get on a plane to Paris.

532
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,449
<i>Listen.</i>

533
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,994
Since the incident, the number of guards
at the airport has doubled.

534
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,081
Thorough background examinations
should be expected.

535
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,459
The movie cover isn't strong enough yet.
I need another week, Jack.

536
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,753
You don't have it.

537
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,798
We got an office.

538
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,884
We got business cards.

539
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,886
We got a poster.

540
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,099
If I'm the Revolutionary Guard,
that's nothing we couldn't have made at home.

541
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,226
Six people's lives depend on this.

542
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,648
It's not enough. If we're gonna fool
these people, it has to be big.

543
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:16,818
And it has to have something
that says it's authentic.

544
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,989
I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.

545
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,284
If you wanna sell a lie...

546
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,829
You get the press to sell it for you.

547
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:32,542
No, no, no. Press event and then
they're gonna read through the script.

548
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:36,671
Well, they got a bunch of actors,
they're gonna read from beginning to end.

549
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,673
They have costumes and everything.

550
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,594
No, no, no, I can't.
<i>Variety</i> has an exclusive on that.

551
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,930
Is there any way to make this
more Middle Eastern?

552
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,183
Mesopotamia? Egypt?

553
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,434
Iran.

554
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:53,188
Look, I can get you in, but you're
gonna have to promise me at least half a page.

555
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,483
No, no, this thing's an event.
It's gonna be a spectacle.

556
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:02,173
- Lester?
- Nina. You look fabulous.

557
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,424
You're doing the reading?

558
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,760
I'm playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.

559
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,887
Great. I'll call you.

560
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,933
Keep that fucking space witch
away from me.

561
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,435
- You know her?
- I was married to her.

562
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,271
Oh, my God, Iraq is amazing.

563
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,564
Oh, we're shooting in Iran.

564
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,148
Iran with an N?

565
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,900
Yeah. We're very excited.

566
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,360
You ever watch the news?

567
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,279
What does the title refer to?

568
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,615
The <i>Argo.</i> You know, it's the thing.

569
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,534
Like Jason and the Golden Fleece,
or what?

570
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,619
No, no. It's the ship. It's the spaceship.

571
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:36,624
It goes everywhere.
It goes all throughout space.

572
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,418
So it's the Argonaut.

573
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,086
No.

574
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,380
- What does "Argo" mean?
- I don't know.

575
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,631
You don't know?

576
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,259
It means "Argo fuck yourself."

577
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,097
Excuse me. May I have
your attention, ladies and gentlemen?

578
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:55,810
If our artists could settle in.
We're just about ready to begin the reading.

579
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:59,731
<i>Argo,</i> by Mary Ann Boyd.

580
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,108
"Fade in on starship landing.

581
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,818
Exterior, bazaar.

582
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,821
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe."

583
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,665
<i>The people working here are not diplomats.</i>

584
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,293
<i>In fact, as Imam Khomeini said...</i>

585
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,339
<i>...we have found no evidence that proves
that these people are diplomats.</i>

586
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:29,010
<i>All evidence proves
that these people are spies.</i>

587
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:32,847
In the name of God,
the beneficent, the merciful...

588
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,642
...our message to the awakened peoples
of the world:

589
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,519
At this time we want
to expose the hateful acts...

590
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,855
Our world has changed.

591
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:44,275
The fire of hope stopped burning
in this galaxy long ago.

592
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,527
The ship is turning around.

593
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,196
Fire the thrusters!

<i>were completely unjustified.</i>

596
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,161
<i>They and all others must know...</i>

597
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,873
<i>...that the United States of America
will not yield...</i>

598
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,751
<i>...to international terrorism or to blackmail.</i>

599
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:05,630
Sir! We'll be crushed!
There's not enough time!

600
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,883
are controlled by capitalists
and large oil companies.

601
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,553
The United States government considers
revolutionaries as terrorists...

602
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,558
...but itself and its CIA are the most
terrorizing organization of all time.

603
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,520
<i>"The story was told,
but there are infinitely more.</i>

604
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,564
<i>Three setting suns.
The princess's robes fall from her body."</i>

605
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,567
<i>if we find his ship
we will find our chance.</i>

606
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,364
Aboard the <i>Argo</i> lies
my hope, my hero, my husband.

607
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,909
We will begin the trials
and carry out the sentences.

608
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:38,955
<i>You wonder where and how this
seemingly endless parade of hatred will end.</i>

609
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:39,080

<i>What do they want? They say the question
should be not "what?" but "who?"</i>

613
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,546
<i>The answer to that is clear.
They want their former shah.</i>

614
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:49,924
<i>Carter and his administration
shameful to talk about human rights.</i>

615
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:54,345
Carter and his government have given
asylum to the worst criminal of all.

616
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,555
<i>For life?</i>

617
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:59,100
<i>They will remain until the shah is returned.</i>

618
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:02,895
<i>But if the exiled shah,
now in a New York City hospital...</i>

619
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,232
<i>...leaves the United States
for anyplace other than Iran...</i>

There is it. What'd I tell you?

First shot of the picture.

627
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,643

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE

631
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:26,771
Brace yourself. It's like talking to
those two old fucks on <i>The Muppets.</i>

632
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,526
Aliens and robots?

633
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,445
Yes, sir.

634
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,324
You're telling me that there is a movie
company in Hollywood right now...

635
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,284
...that is funded by the CIA?

636
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,078
Yes, sir.

637
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,999
- What's wrong with the bikes again?
- We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.

638
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,794
You think this is more plausible
than teachers?

639
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:53,339
Yes, we do.
One, there are no more foreign teachers in Iran.

640
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,716
And we think everybody
knows Hollywood people.

641
00:43:55,925 --> 00:44:00,429
Everybody knows they'd shoot in Stalingrad
with Pol Pot directing if it would sell tickets.

642
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,890
There are only bad options.

643
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,559
It's about finding the best one.

644
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,562
You don't have a better bad idea than this?

645
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,481
This is the best bad idea we have, sir.

646
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,691
By far.

647
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:23,995
The United States government has just
sanctioned your science-fiction movie.

648
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,164
Thank you, sir.

649
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:07,538
I'm required to remind you that if you are
detained, the agency will not claim you.

650
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,374
Barely claim me as it is.

651
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,295
Your "in case of's" good?

652
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,881
It's just Christine.

653
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,761
I should've brought some books
to read in prison.

654
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:22,970
No.

655
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,640
They'll kill you long before prison.

656
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:28,809
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah.

00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:43,574
We got a green light. Keep the office
running until you hear otherwise.

659
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,159
Argo fuck yourself.

660
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,036
Argo fuck yourself.

661
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,515
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

662
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:11,185
<i>This is the final boarding call
for British Airways Flight 87.</i>

663
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,219
<i>"We are a nation of 35 million.</i>

664
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:50,391
And many of these people are looking
forward to martyrdom."

665
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,896
- Hey.
- Hey.

666
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,982
Come to bed.

667
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:00,151
In five minutes.

668
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,373
You know, she pleaded with me.

669
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:18,377
When it started in the streets
nine months ago...

670
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,922
...she begged for us to leave.

671
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,926
She packed our bags, and I said:

672
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,263
"You know what?
You know, just a little bit longer."

673
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,684
And all I was thinking was:

674
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,396
"Stay.

675
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,191
This is good for me.

676
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,777
Stay.

677
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,448
Show Newsom you got the balls."

678
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,123
I can't believe I put Kathy in this position.

679
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,051
I think we're gonna die here.

680
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:38,124
ISTANBUL, TURKEY - January 27, 1980

681
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,980
"Iran is 100 percent
not in a prerevolutionary state."

682
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:04,191
CIA brief, November 1st, 1979.

683
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,360
Can't be right all the time.

684
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:08,028
Kevin.

685
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:09,738
When'd you get back?

686
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,159
The shah escaped in a 747...

687
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,704
...so laden with gold bars,
it nearly didn't make it <i>off</i> the runway.

688
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:17,913
But you kept busy.

689
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:23,127
Ferrying out the torture apparatus
of our friend's fallen dictatorship.

690
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,087
It's getting worse.

691
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:28,215
Everyone who lands at Mehrabad
now fills in one of these.

692
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:33,262
That slip makes a copy to the one underneath.
Passenger keeps yellow, airport keeps white.

693
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:34,972
When you leave, they match them up...

694
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,516
...to verify you came into the country
when you say you did.

695
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:41,645
So if they look, they'll see I didn't come
into the country with six people.

696
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,148
If they look.

697
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:51,197
When you land, you should go straight to
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance...

698
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,823
...to kiss the ring.

699
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,202
Get on record as having applied
for a film permit.

700
00:49:56,535 --> 00:50:00,122
If they catch you later, at least they'll be
confused while they're torturing you.

701
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:08,047
IRANIAN CONSULATE - TURKEY

702
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,975
What will be the purpose
of your visit to Iran?

703
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:23,479
Uh, film production. Business.

704
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,651
Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?

705
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,864
I would've loved to, except my boss
didn't send a telex till I got here.

706
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:38,118
Guy had an intelligent thought in his head,
it would die of loneliness.

707
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:01,809
The <i>Times</i> and AP found out six escaped.

708
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:05,312
They know who they are and they know
they're hiding out with the Canadians.

709
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,273
Somebody with one of the families talked.

710
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,816
Mother of God.

711
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:11,777
Yeah, I just put Vance on a plane
to take the editors to Le Cirque.

712
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,405
He thinks he can
get them to sit on it, for now.

713
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,366
Your guy better get them...

714
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,910
...and get the hell out.

715
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,664
<i>The captain has informed
us that we have entered Iranian airspace.</i>

716
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:28,335
<i>We'll be coming through to collect
any remaining alcoholic beverages.</i>

717
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:08,203
This film crew is just yourself?

718
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,707
No, we have six more from Canada
meeting us today.

719
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,709
You like to film at the bazaar?

720
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,044
The bazaar, maybe the palace.

721
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:18,505
Landmark sites.

722
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,299
I see.

723
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,968
The exotic Orient.

724
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:26,764
Snake charmers, flying carpets.

725
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,559
You came to us at a complicated time.

726
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:34,730
Before the revolution, 40 percent of the movie
theaters in Tehran were showing pornography.

727
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,149
I understand.

728
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:40,486
The function of this office is purification...

729
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,947
...as well as promotion for the arts.

730
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,826
I'll review this for the minister.

731
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:49,995
Okay. Thank you.

732
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,215
Lester, you're working late.

733
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,300
Till the dawn's early light.

734
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:07,346
You got stamina, Lester. I wanna be you.

735
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,390
Well, I'm 150 years old,
so you wouldn't be me for long.

736
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,486
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Ken Taylor.

737
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,154
Thank you for what you're doing.

738
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:27,783
I was expecting more of a G-man look.

739
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,869
I think you're thinking of the FBI, sir.

740
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,997
Ah. This way.

741
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:49,847
- These are blank, you know. Stamps...
- Yeah, I'll take care of this.

742
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,183
How long?

743
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:56,186
A day, prep their covers.
Two if they need it.

744
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,688
And you'll fly out with them?

745
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,731
Yeah.

746
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,567
There's something you should know.

747
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:05,028
We think our housekeeper
has figured out who they are.

748
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:10,033
We don't know if we can trust her,
so sooner is better.

749
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,209
Hi.

750
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,253
My name's Kevin Harkins...

751
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:05,923
...and I'm gonna get you home.

752
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,010
These are the screenplays
for your cover identities.

753
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:14,097
It's theater of the absurd.

754
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,850
- What are our chances?
- Your chances are good.

755
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:20,145
"Good"? Well, what's the number value
of "good"?

756
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:23,065
Thirty percent chance
of being publicly executed?

757
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,777
Can you tell me what the objection was
to normal cover identities?

758
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:29,154
There are no Canadians in the country
for normal reasons.

759
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,864
- They'll sniff us out regardless.
- The Swedish Consul?

760
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:34,701
They accused him of being an American
at the airport. They held him for an hour.

761
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,913
We can't hold up under that.
We don't know what the hell movie people do.

762
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,206
That's why I'm here.

763
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,876
I'm gonna help you. I'll be with you
the whole way. This is what I do.

764
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,087
Have you gotten people out
this way before?

765
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,923
This would be a first.

766
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:53,011
Do you know that every day they catch
another friend of the shah at the airport?

767
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,681
Kangaroo trials and then firing squads...

768
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,600
...just for having American names
in their phone books.

769
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,227
You've been here an hour.

770
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,813
And you're asking us to trust you
with our lives, Mr...?

771
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,314
Harkins.

772
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,316
That's your real name?

773
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,151
No.

774
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:14,908
I know there are risks involved.
Serious risks.

775
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,119
But it is time to go.

776
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:23,208
We've got orders to close the embassy
and go back. There's nowhere for them to stay.

777
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:29,423
We will never make it through
immigration at the airport. I'm serious.

778
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:33,510
No, no, no, this is what, the part when
we say this is so crazy it might actually work?

779
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,512
Joe, I saw it in Burma. They get people out.

780
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,932
Snitches in banana republics?
They get them over the border after the coup.

781
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,142
That's your opinion, Joe.

782
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,477
You know, his opinion got us out
in the first place.

783
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:47,107
If we go out there with fake passports,
we are spies, period. That's execution.

784
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,818
- You got a problem lying, Joe?
- Point is, we can't stay here.

785
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:54,114
If we get caught, you and Pat go on trial
for harboring the enemy, you know that?

786
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,867
Pat and I have discussed it.
It's the risk we took.

787
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,579
That man out there
has got bad cards and he is going to lose.

788
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:04,041
And if he loses, it's our lives.

789
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,335
And his life too.

790
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:10,672
Look, we don't have any alternatives.

791
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:12,049
We gotta go.

792
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:22,017
These cover identities were created
specifically for each one of you.

793
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,728
What you need to do is memorize
everything that's inside.

794
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:27,814
Who you are, what you are,
where you've been. Complete bio.

795
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,066
And then add to that.

796
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,652
Where do you vacation? What are your
allergies? Who'd you have an affair with?

797
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:33,987
The only way this works...

798
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:37,824
...is if you believe that you're these people
so much that you dream like them.

799
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:40,494
Get started tonight.

800
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:44,206
I'll be back tomorrow.
We'll get going. Good luck.

801
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:51,505
Well, my guy kind of sucks.

802
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,048
What's your name?

803
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:56,051
Mike McEwan, eh? Heh.

804
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,053
That was convincing.

805
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,888
Kathy, what's your name?

806
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,086
The Love Boat
<i>will be seen 15 minutes from now.</i>

807
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:35,048
<i>The State Department insisted today
that the crisis in Afghanistan...</i>

808
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:39,302
<i>...will not divert the attention of the
United States from the plight of the hostages.</i>

809
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,180
<i>--Is perceived to be if not impotent,
then at least reluctant...</i>

810
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:46,852
<i>Now the United States finds itself in such
bitter confrontation with the Soviet Union...</i>

811
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,855
<i>...over that country's invasion
of Afghanistan...</i>

812
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,482
<i>The United States
is now moving toward a decision...</i>

813
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,693
<i>...to boycott the Summer Olympics
in Moscow...</i>

814
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:59,072
Bad news, bad news.
Even when it's good news, it's bad news.

815
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:03,577
John Wayne's in the ground six months,
this is what's left of America.

816
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,734
<i>"The Minister of Culture and Guidance
has approved your location scout.</i>

817
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:37,819
He will send his representative to meet
you and your crew...

818
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:41,573
...at the Khayyam entrance
to the Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 p.m."

819
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:43,617
They called your bluff.

820
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,369
- Maybe they're cooperating.
- <i>Absolutely not.</i>

821
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:51,166
Seven Americans walking the bazaar
is asking for a riot. It's the hive.

822
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,667
Seven Canadians, Jack.

823
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,962
<i>Never give them multiple shots at a cover.</i>

824
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:57,964
Are they even ready?

825
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,382
They're getting there.

826
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,092
There's no prize for "Most Improved."

827
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,970
I don't have a choice.
We say no, they show up at the residence...

828
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,765
...and drag everyone out.
You think their covers are gonna hold up...

829
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,767
...when they're getting their fingernails
pulled out?

830
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:32,791
You want us to go to the Grand Bazaar
at 3:00 in the afternoon?

831
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,878
You said a day to learn our covers,
then straight to the airport.

832
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:38,672
They suspect something?

833
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,591
What I know is,
we need to pretend to be a movie crew.

834
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:45,178
We go to the bazaar today,
we fly out from the airport tomorrow.

835
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:48,682
We won't do it.

836
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,186
He told them that there were six of us.
So they're expecting six.

837
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,563
It would be suspicious
not to show up at this point.

838
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,857
What else do we have to do, all right?

839
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,568
He's about to show them
the only cards that we're holding...

840
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:04,406
- ...which is that they don't know we're here!
- That's the ball game, okay?

841
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,700
Look, we don't have any other choice!

842
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,202
Who says that we'll know our covers
well enough?

843
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,121
We're not in the CIA.

844
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:13,873
It's suicide.

845
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,126
I'm asking you to trust me.

846
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:18,712
I don't trust you.

847
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,800
This is the game, Joe.
What world are you living in?

848
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:27,595
The one where they're hanging people
from construction cranes, Bob.

849
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:30,849
It's too dangerous.
I won't bring my wife into the bazaar.

850
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,269
Joe?

851
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,819
So we'll see you at 2.

852
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:10,764
So don't be recognizable
but look exactly like your passport photo.

853
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:14,476
I haven't been this nervous
since our wedding.

854
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,355
Only this isn't a huge mistake, hopefully.

855
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,691
Sorry. Okay.

856
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:25,779
Hello?

857
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,949
Hello?

858
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:31,785
Hello?

859
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,959
Who was that?

860
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,006
- Mark?
- Yeah?

861
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,885
I'm scared.

862
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,472
It's okay.

863
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,521
Where are they?

864
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,022
In the kitchen.

865
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,418
This is what I do. I get people out.

866
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,755
And I've never left anyone behind.

867
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,801
I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins.

868
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:20,226
My name is Tony Mendez.
I'm from New York.

869
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:23,146
My father worked construction.
My mother teaches elementary school.

870
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,690
I have a wife and a 10-year-old son.

871
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:32,780
You play along with me today,
I promise you, I will get you out tomorrow.

872
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,870
Fuck.

873
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,329
Shit.

874
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:49,857
Hang on.

875
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:39,657
You all right?

876
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,081
Okay. Tell me who you are.

877
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,043
Mike McEwan, cameraman.

878
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,795
Robert Baker, director.

879
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:55,256
Timothy Harris, location manager.

880
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,425
Mary Ann Boyd, screenwriter.

881
01:08:57,592 --> 01:08:59,344
Rachel Dewart, production designer.

882
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,262
Sean Bissett, associate producer.

883
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,973
All right. Let's go make a movie.

884
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,280
Welcome, welcome.
My name is Reza Bolhani.

885
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:21,824
- Kevin Harkins. I'm the producer.
- Nice to meet you.

886
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,618
This is Mike McEwan, our cameraman.

887
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:25,995
This is Tim.
This is Mary, our screenwriter.

888
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,664
And this is our director, Bob Baker.

889
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,582
- You are the director?
- Yes.

890
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:32,210
Is this film a foreign-bride film?

891
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,420
Sorry?

892
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,048
A film where a foreign bride comes to Iran...

893
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:40,760
...but she doesn't understand the language
or the customs...

894
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:43,471
...and there is misunderstandings
and laughs.

895
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:45,098
Oh, no.

896
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:55,775
The bazaar in Tehran
is one of the largest in the world.

897
01:09:56,359 --> 01:10:00,530
This bazaar has been on this spot
for over 8000 years.

898
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:04,909
You can find many items
such as paper, spices...

899
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:07,620
...precious metals, all right here.

900
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:08,996
Right this way, please.

901
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,753
This way.

902
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:32,145
- Uh, Mike?
- Yeah.

903
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:36,482
If I was to say you're looking through the
wrong end of that viewfinder, would I be right?

904
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,361
Yup.

905
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:48,703
Just a little further.

906
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,944
Please wait here. Let's stay together.

907
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:40,505
He wants the photograph you took.

908
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:43,758
It's okay, it's her job to take photographs.
She's the production designer.

909
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:47,178
He says he did not give you permission
to take a photograph of his store.

910
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:50,014
That's okay. You can tell him he can have it.

911
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,392
Please, please, just take the photograph.

912
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:04,237
Peace be upon you.

913
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:05,780
And upon you, sir. Welcome.

914
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:07,198
I hope you are well.

915
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:09,033
Thank you very much. How are you?

916
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:11,619
I'm very well. What's your name?

917
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:12,954
Sahar.

918
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:27,134
He's saying that the shah killed his son
with an American gun.

919
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:39,188
No, no, no! No! Canada!

920
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,398
Canada!

921
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:42,859
I would like to suggest that we end our visit.

922
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,286
You know, sister...

923
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:57,456
...those who are with him, Rasool of Allah,
we are tender among ourselves.

924
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,166
But stern against the Kufar.

925
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,210
As God wills it.

926
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:06,048
But those who sit silently have sinned.

927
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,510
How else may I help, sir?

928
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:12,013
No, no,just one thing.

929
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:15,516
How long have they been here?

930
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:17,810
Pardon?

931
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:20,855
The guests of the Ambassador.

932
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:22,231
The guests of the Ambassador.
How long have they been here?

933
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,694
They arrived two days ago.

934
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:32,199
Forgive my intrusion, one must be vigilant.

935
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:36,370
Everyone in this house is a friend of Iran.

936
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:12,365
How'd it go?

937
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,618
What about tomorrow?

938
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,496
Tomorrow they'll be ready.

939
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,710
<i>For Kennedy, a stunning turnaround...</i>

940
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,921
<i>...one week after humiliation in Illinois.</i>

941
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,381
<i>I love New York.</i>

942
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:32,301
<i>And I love Connecticut too.</i>

943
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:35,096
<i>How did he win here? Well, he had help.</i>

944
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:39,892
<i>I'm responsible for anything
that goes wrong in this government.</i>

945
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:44,105
A man in Scranton is placing a flag
in his lawn for every day of captivity.

946
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:48,234
When he runs out of lawn,
Kennedy wins the primary.

947
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:51,195
The six with the Canadians
are coming out.

948
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:03,833
Who signed off on this?

949
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,794
- You. Where was your passport issued?
- Vancouver.

950
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:08,254
- Where were you born?
- Toronto.

951
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:10,423
"Torono." Canadians don't pronounce the T.

952
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:13,009
Some Komiteh guard
is actually gonna know that?

953
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:16,971
If you're detained for questioning, they will
bring in someone who knows that. Yes.

954
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:20,349
Mary, who were the last three prime ministers
of Canada?

955
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:23,310
Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker.

956
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,146
- What's your father's name?
- Howard.

957
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:27,064
- What's his occupation?
- Fisherman.

958
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:29,483
- Where were you born?
- Halifax, Nova Scotia.

959
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,402
What's your date of birth?

960
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:33,738
February 21st, 1952.

961
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,865
- Good. What's your job on the movie?
- Producer.

962
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:38,784
- Associate. Last movie you produced?
<i>- High and Dry.</i>

963
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,453
- Who paid for that?
- CFDC.

964
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:42,955
What's your middle name?
What's your middle name?

965
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:44,832
- Leon?
- Shoot him. He's an American spy.

966
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:50,296
Look, they're gonna try to break you, okay?
By trying to get you agitated.

967
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,590
You have to know your résumé
back to front.

968
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:57,094
You really believe your little story's gonna make
a difference when there's a gun to our heads?

969
01:15:58,012 --> 01:16:01,182
I think my story's the only thing
between you and a gun to your head.

970
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:05,561
Okay.

971
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:13,736
Hey, they made it through
the location scout.

972
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,374
You have a call.

973
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,345
What is it?

974
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:40,596
Go to black on green.

975
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:44,391
Go.

976
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,018
- <i>It all just changed.</i>
- What?

977
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:48,771
- <i>They're calling the game. You gotta come back.</i>
- What?

978
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:51,649
Joint Chiefs are planning
a military rescue of the hostages.

979
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:54,360
<i>Delta Force has started training
to storm the grounds.</i>

980
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:56,403
<i>So if the six of them...</i>

981
01:16:56,570 --> 01:17:00,199
...are brought down there,
they won't be held for long.

982
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:04,745
Fuck. Goddamn it. I never would have exposed
them if I wasn't authorized to get them out.

983
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:07,623
- It's over, Tony.
- If they stay here, they will be taken.

984
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:12,545
- Probably not alive.
- Listen to me. The thinking has changed.

985
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:16,382
Six Americans get pulled out
of a Canadian diplomat's house and executed...

986
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:18,467
...it's a world outrage.

987
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,595
Six Americans get caught playing
movie make-believe...

988
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:24,431
...with the CIA at the airport and executed?

989
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:29,478
It's a national embarrassment.
They are calling the operation.

990
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,275
We're responsible for these people.

991
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:38,070
What we are is required to follow orders.

992
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:40,322
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

993
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:51,083
Fuck!

994
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:58,966
Come in.

995
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:02,178
Ready to try again.

996
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:07,183
You're ready. You worked hard.

997
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:11,228
Probably the best thing to do for you
right now would be...

998
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,522
...just to relax.

999
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,399
Okay.

1000
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,401
You did good.

1001
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:19,612
Thanks.

1002
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:35,294
Scorched-earth policy tonight.

1003
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:38,839
Nothing gets left.

1004
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,389
So you know.

1005
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:52,978
ExtAff wants you to burn the passports
before you leave.

1006
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:59,151
If we tell them now, they'll panic.
I think it's best if you just don't show.

1007
01:19:01,654 --> 01:19:03,697
It was always a fucked mission.

1008
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:06,659
You came closer than anybody else.

1009
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:17,294
<i>If it keeps on rainin'
Levee's goin' to break</i>

1010
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:22,925
<i>If it keeps on rainin'
Levee's goin' to break</i>

1011
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:30,015
<i>When the levee breaks
I'll have no place to stay</i>

1012
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:39,978
Ahem. It's off.
They want us to pack up the office.

1013
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,816
This can wait. Let's go get a drink.

1014
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:11,051
He's late.

1015
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:25,524
O'Donnell.

1016
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:26,942
<i>Somebody's responsible...</i>

1017
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:28,944
...when things happen, Jack.

1018
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,155
I'm responsible.

1019
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,949
- I'm taking them through.
- Tony?

1020
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:48,297
Alan. Alan. We need to confirm those
seven tickets out of Tehran on Swissair.

1021
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:50,757
- N.E. shut that down.
- I say it's back on.

1022
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:53,677
- I can't do it. It's backstopped.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1023
01:22:53,844 --> 01:22:56,847
What the hell you talking about, backstopped?
What the hell's that mean?

1024
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:59,808
Carter's gotta say yes for us
to get the tickets.

1025
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:10,819
It's time to go.

1026
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:22,206
All right.

1027
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,752
- Where's Engell?
- He's in a meeting.

1028
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:29,838
- Pull him out.
- Uh...

1029
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,173
Pull him out!

1030
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,175
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

1031
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,427
- Thank you.
- See you soon.

1032
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:37,513
- Sahar's on a bus.
- Great.

1033
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,097
Sahar will be fine.

1034
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,016
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1035
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:44,520
- You two leave right now, right?
- We'll be on a train in half an hour.

1036
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:45,771
Good.

1037
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:50,567
<i>N.E. said no.</i>

1038
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:55,405
<i>This is not a long leasher, and it never
has been, and you don't decide if it goes!</i>

1039
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:56,782
It is going!

1040
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,951
Jack, you are this close.

1041
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:00,994
Am I? Am I really that close?

1042
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:03,121
You are this goddamn close to the line
with me.

1043
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:06,833
I am not gonna leave him at the airport
with six people and his dick in his hand.

1044
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,462
You tell the director to call the White House.
Do your fucking job!

1045
01:24:19,096 --> 01:24:20,180
Get to your plane, Claude.

1046
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:30,649
First time anyone's gonna ask you
a question is at the first checkpoint.

1047
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:33,819
<i>The first checkpoint is just
to get a look at your passports.</i>

1048
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:37,990
<i>Passports came straight from Ottawa
last week. They're clean.</i>

1049
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,242
Find the White House chief of staff.

1050
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:41,493
How would I find him?

1051
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:44,663
We're a fucking spy agency! Find him!

1052
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:48,750
The second checkpoint is immigration.

1053
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,669
You're each gonna hand them one of these.

1054
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:53,422
<i>It says that you landed in the country
two days ago.</i>

1055
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:57,009
<i>They'll look for the matching white one,
which doesn't exist.</i>

1056
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:58,969
<i>You'll say you don't know what happened.</i>

1057
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:01,054
<i>And if you believe they lost the white slip...</i>

1058
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:03,390
<i>...they'll believe it too.</i>

1059
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:07,352
Jordan's in the West Wing.
He's not taking calls.

1060
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:10,355
Where are his kids?

1061
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:11,565
What?

1062
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:13,275
Where do his kids go to school?

1063
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:21,783
Thank you, thank you.

1064
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,202
Pace Academy, Buckhead, Georgia.

1065
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:28,624
White House.

1066
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:33,378
Yes, this is Mr. Murphy from Pace Academy
calling for Mr. Jordan.

1067
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,881
Yeah, I'm afraid it is an emergency.

1068
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:38,258
Hold for the chief of staff'ss office.

1069
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:41,011
The third checkpoint is the trap.

1070
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:42,804
It's manned by the Revolutionary Guard.

1071
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:45,682
Most of them were educated
in the U.S. or Europe.

1072
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:49,102
And all of whom are looking for Americans.

1073
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:01,990
Hello?

1074
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,950
<i>- Jack O'Donnell, from C.I.</i>
- Wait, wait, who?

1075
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:07,913
Tehran Houseguest operation is ready now.
We don't have the president's go-ahead.

1076
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,165
<i>They are going to be captured.</i>

1077
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:11,458
David, pick up!

1078
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:31,645
Zurich. It's under Harkins.

1079
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:42,489
I'm sorry, sir, I don't seem
to have these reservations.

1080
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,953
Telex on flash.

1081
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,956
Would you mind checking again, please?

1082
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:02,384
Copy D.S. Confirm the tickets! Go!

1083
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,482
My apologies. It just came through.

1084
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:26,867
Swissair says they picked up the tickets.

1085
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:29,703
Get the L.A. office,
tell them to be ready in case they call.

1086
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:31,997
We told them to shut that down.

1087
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:04,529
There you go.

1088
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,798
Not here.

1089
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,779
When did you come to Iran?

1090
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,115
Two days ago.

1091
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:31,950
What was the purpose of your visit?

1092
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:35,620
We are looking for locations for a film.

1093
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:43,503
We have a--

1094
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:48,550
Oh, yeah. I've got a letter
from the Ministry of Culture.

1095
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,720
If you want to take a look at that. All right?

1096
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:13,950
- Ahem.
- You can go.

1097
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,170
Come on, come on.

1098
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:42,145
<i>Swissair Flight 363
is now boarding Rows 18 to 35.</i>

1099
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:18,807
We're going to...

1100
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:51,047
We're together, yes.
The six of us, we're from Canada.

1101
01:31:52,549 --> 01:31:54,634
Purser's telling Swissair
they're not on the plane.

1102
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:56,302
They should have boarded already.

1103
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:58,054
Still no answer in L.A.

1104
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:24,289
Sir.

1105
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:37,802
Yes, it's a fantasy story
about a war in another world.

1106
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:39,679
Here you can see our notices.

1107
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,852
Of course I speak Farsi.

1108
01:32:46,019 --> 01:32:48,229
I wish to make a film in Iran.

1109
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:08,458
No, I'm the writer.

1110
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:10,543
Kevin, give me the storyboards.

1111
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:15,173
These are the drawings that show
what we will film for the movie.

1112
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:18,009
Alien villains have taken over the hero's planet.

1113
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:21,346
They fight for their families and
take back the city.

1114
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:27,852
The villains know he is the chosen one,
so they kidnap his son in the spice market.

1115
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:32,023
So he and his wife storm the castle.

1116
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:39,197
The people...hold that... the people are inspired to join him.
They are farmers, but they learn to fight.

1117
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:44,744
They shoot weapons at their enemies.

1118
01:33:48,957 --> 01:33:52,210
And the king of the aliens is destroyed
when the people find their courage.

1119
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,513
You don't go until we verify.

1120
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:10,103
I understand.

1121
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,438
Sir, you can call our office.

1122
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:13,940
They'll verify.

1123
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:42,051
- It'd go all the way throughout the '30s.
- We're shooting right now.

1124
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:46,097
- We're just going to the Producers Building.
- Yeah, I understand. We're shooting right now.

Wait.

Ladies and gentlemen,
it is our pleasure to announce...

Yeah, man.

Quote's the other way around.

1163
01:45:00,211 --> 01:45:02,713
- Yeah, who said it?
- Marx.

1164
01:45:03,631 --> 01:45:04,673
Groucho said that?

1165
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:11,722
Call the <i>Times,</i> nail it to the goddamn door.

1166
01:45:11,889 --> 01:45:13,599
CIA are the good guys.

1167
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:15,601
The Canadians are the good guys.

1168
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:17,478
Yeah, we're not greedy. Them too.

1169
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:22,733
Only. Canada takes the credit,
or they retaliate against the hostages.

1170
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:25,402
Great Satan wasn't involved.

1171
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:28,155
No CIA.

1172
01:45:28,364 --> 01:45:29,907
Is that right, Jack?

1173
01:45:32,076 --> 01:45:33,786
Involved in what?

1174
01:45:34,787 --> 01:45:37,289
We were as surprised as anybody.

1175
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:41,961
Thank you, Canada.

1176
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:44,839
MacDonald:
<i>We knew that each day they stayed there...</i>

1177
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:47,675
<i>...the danger was becoming greater.</i>

1178
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:51,929
<i>We had been looking for a solution to have them
leave the country during the past three months.</i>

1179
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:54,765
<i>Day 87, and finally a sliver
of really good news.</i>

1180
01:45:54,932 --> 01:45:58,727
The U.S. Department of State
hereby honors Joe Stafford...

1181
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:01,647
...Kathy Stafford...

1182
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,650
...Mark Lijek...

1183
01:46:05,276 --> 01:46:10,489
<i>We Americans will be forever grateful
to our great friend and ally to the north...</i>

1184
01:46:10,656 --> 01:46:14,910
<i>...for the protection and the safe passage
provided for our diplomats.</i>

1185
01:46:15,077 --> 01:46:16,328
Bob Anders.

1186
01:46:16,495 --> 01:46:19,206
<i>Here, or anywhere in the world...</i>

1187
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:20,958
<i>...Canada will pay...</i>

1188
01:46:22,293 --> 01:46:26,297
<i>...for this violation
of the sovereignty of Iran.</i>

1189
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:30,676
<i>Thank you to Pat and Ken Taylor
and the great nation of Canada.</i>

1190
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:37,224
So I'm sitting in Jerry's this morning,
I'm having breakfast.

1191
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:40,477
Waitress comes over to me,
she's waving a newspaper, and she says:

1192
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:44,023
"You see what those Canadians pulled off?
Why can't we do something like that?"

1193
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:46,650
And I said to her-- Do you know what I said?

1194
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:48,193
No, what?

1195
01:46:48,736 --> 01:46:50,195
"Argo fuck yourself."

1196
01:47:18,974 --> 01:47:20,017
All set.

1197
01:47:20,976 --> 01:47:22,353
Thanks a lot.

1198
01:47:33,489 --> 01:47:34,490
Ha!

1199
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:39,370
Heh. And I left my autograph book at home.

1200
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,710
His Eminence called me.

1201
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:48,087
He wants to see you.

1202
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:50,297
Probably wants to fire me himself.

1203
01:47:51,423 --> 01:47:53,759
He wants to give you the Intelligence Star.

1204
01:47:54,969 --> 01:47:56,804
You're getting the highest award of merit...

1205
01:47:57,012 --> 01:48:00,349
...of the Clandestine Services
of these United States.

1206
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:03,227
Ceremony's on the 14th.

1207
01:48:03,394 --> 01:48:06,563
If they push it a week, I can bring lan.
That's his winter break.

1208
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:12,403
The op was classified,
so the ceremony's classified.

1209
01:48:12,569 --> 01:48:15,614
He can't know about it.
Nobody can know about it.

1210
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:20,244
So they're just gonna give me an award
and then they're gonna take it back.

1211
01:48:20,828 --> 01:48:21,870
That's right.

1212
01:48:23,747 --> 01:48:26,083
If we wanted applause,
we would've joined the circus.

1213
01:48:27,793 --> 01:48:29,920
- I thought we did.
- Ha.

1214
01:48:30,587 --> 01:48:33,382
Carter said you were a great American.

1215
01:48:34,091 --> 01:48:35,759
Great American what?

1216
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:37,761
He didn't say.

1217
01:48:51,108 --> 01:48:52,359
What happened to your picture?

1218
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:55,195
It's in turnaround.

1219
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:39,073
Can I come in?

1220
01:50:25,077 --> 01:50:35,879
The Iran Hostage crisis ended on January 20, 1981, when all
remaining hostages were released. They spent <i>444</i> days in captivity.

1221
01:50:37,422 --> 01:50:47,558
The involvement of the C.I.A. complemented efforts of the Canadian embassy in freeing the six held in Tehran.
To this day, this story stands as an enduring model for international cooperation between governments.

1222
01:50:48,976 --> 01:50:55,399
All of the Houseguests returned to the U.S.
Foreign service after their ordeal in Iran

1223
01:50:56,942 --> 01:51:06,910
Oscar-winning makeup artist John Chambers was awarded the C.I.A.'s intelligence Medal,
its highest civilian honor. He and Mendez remained friends until Chambers! death in 2001.

1224
01:51:08,704 --> 01:51:15,669
Tony Mendez's intelligence Star was returned to him in 1997,
when the Argo operation was declassified by President Clinton.

1225
01:51:25,721 --> 01:51:33,687
He lives in rural Maryland with his family.

1226
01:53:26,133 --> 01:53:31,138
<i>They went in, as you know, under
the guise of creating a motion-picture film.</i>

1227
01:53:31,346 --> 01:53:35,976
<i>But that it had a very high possibility
of failure.</i>

1228
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:38,437
<i>And after it was successful, of course...</i>

1229
01:53:38,603 --> 01:53:41,398
<i>...it was a great temptation
to reveal all the stories...</i>

1230
01:53:41,565 --> 01:53:44,985
<i>...so maybe I could take a little bit
of credit for it, since I was president...</i>

1231
01:53:45,152 --> 01:53:49,740
<i>...but we had to keep it secret.
Tony Mendez has gone down in CIA history...</i>

1232
01:53:49,906 --> 01:53:51,783
<i>...after his retirement...</i>

1233
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:58,790
<i>...as one of the 50 most important
CIA operatives of all time.</i>

1234
01:53:59,416 --> 01:54:04,796
<i>Eventually we got every hostage
back home, safe and sound...</i>

1235
01:54:04,963 --> 01:54:08,967
<i>...and we upheld the integrity of our country,
and we did it peacefully.</i>
