1
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:23,898
In my town, we had a game called the "Squid Game."

2
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,195
We called it that because it's played in a court shaped like a squid.

3
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,573
The rules are simple.

4
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:37,579
Children are divided into two groups, the offense and the defense.

5
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:43,960
Once the game starts, the defense can run around on two feet within bounds,

6
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,006
while the offense outside the lines are only allowed to hop on one foot.

7
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,469
It's your mom.

8
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:58,475
But if an attacker cuts through the waist of the squid passing defense,

9
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,394
then they are given freedom to use both feet.

10
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,277
Inspector royal.

11
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,738
Inspector royal.

12
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,657
For whatever reason, we called that the inspector royal.

13
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,329
When we were ready for the final battle,

14
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:23,249
all the attackers gathered at the entrance to the squid.

15
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,504
Go.

16
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,048
In order to win,

17
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:33,176
the attackers must tap the small closed-off space

18
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,178
on the squid's head with their foot.

19
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,432
But if someone on the defense manages to push you

20
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,434
outside of the squid's boundaries,

21
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,603
you die.

22
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,607
That's right. You die.

23
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,292
Victory!

24
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,544
Victory.

25
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,923
Once you tap the squid's head, you win and yell out, "Victory."

26
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:16,845
At that moment, I felt as if I owned the entire world,

27
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,345
exhilarated.

28
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,493
EPISODE 1 RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT

29
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,829
Ah.

30
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,623
Um...

31
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,002
Is this my daily allowance or what?

32
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:54,424
No. Remember, Ga-yeong's birthday is today?

33
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,636
Yeah. Of course, I do.

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,766
And don't forget, go and get her, uh, something for dinner later.

35
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,020
Well, I can't buy her a nice meal with these much. Times are tough.

36
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,607
Ga-yeong loves fried chicken, you know.

37
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,192
Go buy her some fried chicken.

38
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,069
Just chicken, Mom?

39
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,535
Don't you think I should get a present for her?

40
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,781
Give me some more, huh?

41
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,075
I'm broke.

42
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,911
What are you talking about?

43
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,622
I gave you everything I made chauffeuring.

44
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,624
Oh, please, that petty change?

45
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,794
Hey, we can't even pay your loan's monthly interest off with that.

46
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,131
We can't do that now, and we barely spend anything.

47
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,050
Let's use some when we have to.

48
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,344
Goodness.

49
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,554
Oh.

50
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,770
And will you stop working so much?

51
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,522
Make sure you soak the dishes after you're done.

52
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,611
You don't even make that much, plus you're pulling your back out!

53
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,165
Ah!

54
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,306
DAEHAN BANK

55
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,307
ENTER YOUR PIN

56
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:29,727
Huh?

57
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,853
Hey.

58
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,105
It should be my birthday.

59
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,565
- No way. - Pin number changed on you, huh?

60
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,068
I guess your mother finally abandoned you.

61
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,695
Hold on.

62
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,782
Huh?

63
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,576
Oh, shit. What did that woman change it to, huh?

64
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,161
Try her birthday or, or something.

65
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,745
Her birthday?

66
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,415
Her birthday.

67
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,332
Um, uh...

68
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,769
You're telling me you don't know your own mother's birthday?

69
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,961
- Any kid knows that. - Hey!

70
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,088
- Don't say that. I do know. - Hey.

71
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,883
She celebrates it going by the lunar date, meaning it's not the same every year.

72
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,636
- Use your brain for once. - Then put in the lunar date.

73
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,389
Come on. Work!

74
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,475
Oh, goddamn it!

75
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,312
Oh, shit.

76
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,605
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hold on.

77
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,649
They'll block your card if you get it wrong again.

78
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,693
You really gotta think about this one.

79
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,849
Please select the amount you would like to withdraw.

80
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,292
Oh!

81
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,169
What was it? Your birthday?

82
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,712
My kid's. It's today.

83
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,839
Ah! The old woman cares about her granddaughter

84
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,424
more than her own son.

85
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,468
Ah, shit.

86
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,446
- Number nine... - Go, go, go.

87
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,156
- Come on! - Come on!

88
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,911
- Come on! - Go, go!

89
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,521
Go! Yeah, come on. Go! Go!

90
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,857
Go, go!

91
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,484
Let's go.

92
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,277
Let's go!

93
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,238
Go! Go! Faster!

94
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,743
Dang!

95
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,205
You told me that I was gonna win this. Goddamn it!

96
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,124
Stupid little jerk.

97
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,795
How could you lose with an animal like that?

98
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,806
Attention. Betting for the tenth race is about to end.

99
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,557
Please place your final bet.

100
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,036
- I repeat. Betting for the tenth race... - Hey, man, hurry up, will you, please?

101
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,771
...is about to end. Please place your final bet.

102
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,523
Hey, buddy.

103
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,211
- Hey, what are you... Ooh! - Please don't touch me!

104
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,154
How about you leave me alone? Can't you see I'm trying to think?

105
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,666
Okay.

106
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,940
No. 9 Baekil Legend is placed right in the middle.

107
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,775
That's it.

108
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,175
Come on.

109
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,468
Go, come on.

110
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,637
Go. Okay. Yeah.

111
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,141
That's it. Come on, come on!

112
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,018
Come on! Faster! Faster! Come on.

113
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,606
Yeah. Oh!

114
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,490
No. 6, Thunderflash, continues to run forward.

115
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,235
- Go! Go! - Thunderflash outruns No. 7...

116
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,796
Go six and eight!

117
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,321
That's it! That's it! That's it!

118
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,094
That's it! Go, six and eight!

119
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,414
Second place from...

120
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,208
I did it, man. Six and eight!

121
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,588
- Why did you choose six, anyway? - Oh!

122
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,797
Damn! What did I say?

123
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,551
Today's June 8th. Six and eight! The day my daughter was born!

124
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,078
- Four and a half million won. - Oh, thanks so much.

125
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,645
Here. A little something for you. Thanks again.

126
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,409
- What do I get? - Come on!

127
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,108
Hey, wait up for me, asshole!

128
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,527
OFF TRACK BETTING

129
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,950
I hope you're excited. Uh-huh! I'll pick you up after school, okay?

130
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,456
Fried chicken?

131
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,250
Hey, you can get something really expensive tonight, huh!

132
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,503
Don't worry about the price at all, okay? Hmm?

133
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,463
Mm, mm, mm...

134
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,633
Think about what you wanna eat and make me a list during recess.

135
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,009
Okay, honey?

136
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,637
I'll see you at seven then.

137

♪ Guess what I'm getting for the birthday girl ♪

138
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,350
Look forward to it.

00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,851
You're not gonna believe what...

140
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,104
Hey! Hey, Gi-hun!

141
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,188
Hey!

142
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,483
Long time no see, huh!

143
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,986
Hey, Ga-yeong, hold on, right. I love you too. Okay, bye.

144
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,839
- Huh? - Hey, hey, hey.

145
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,240
- He's running! - Get him!

146
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,452
Excuse me. Coming through. Sorry.

147
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,995
Oh.

148
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,580
Oh!

149
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,333
Oh.

150
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,668
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,754
Hey, kid, you okay? Oh. Shit!

152
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,008
- I'm sorry. - Hey, get him!

153
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,594
Get him! Over there! Over there!

154
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,224
Wait a minute. Let me stand up.

155
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,727
Okay. Just... Look, I got cash for real.

156
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,229
Oh, yeah?

157
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,022
Uh-huh.

158
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,275
- Then why did you run, huh? - Because I...

159
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,238
I, I've been saving up so I... I could pay you all the ones that I took.

160
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,784
Goodness, what a trooper. Look at you.

161
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,244
So then, how much you got?

162
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,620
Four million.

163
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,541
Take this amount now. I'll pay the rest next month, so...

164
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,834
What...

165
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,965
Oh!

166
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,300
Hey, kid, you okay?

167
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,177
Oh.

168
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,701
Let me see. Oop, oop, oop, opp, oop,

169
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,598
Come on, let me see.

170
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,433
Poor thing.

171
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,730
Ahh...

172
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,190
Got a sweet taste of it.

173
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,035
I guess you're still eating well. Spending the money you know is mine.

174
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,653
I swear I had it...

175
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,113
I had it, I had your money.

176
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,158
Look, I bet on six and eight and they won, so I had the cash right here.

177
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,241
Hey.

178
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,085
Do you know why nosebleeds are so easy to get, huh?

179
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,922
Because there are so many capillaries.

180
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,966
Oh, no. Hey, don't do this.

181
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,111
- I don't wanna die. - Your blood was tasty.

182
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,597
I think my boys and I should make a nice delicious soup in it.

183
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,807
I'll pay you!

184
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,353
I'll pay you. I mean it. I'll pay you.

185
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,438
Jesus, guy.

186
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,899
Don't make me feel sorry for you with all that crying.

187
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,109
How did you know I was such a softie?

188
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,989
Hey.

189
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,409
Okay, wipe off your tears.

190
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,286
Sign here and your fingerprint.

191
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:07,249
If you don't pay it off by next month, I'll take one of your kidneys.

192
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,795
And then after that, I'll take one of your eyes. Okay?

193
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,590
- You don't like it? - No, uh, I got it. Yeah.

194
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,510
Next month is good with me.

195
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,303
- Here. - Okay.

196
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,013
Well, I, I need ink.

197
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,186
There, you got your ink. It's all natural too.

198
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,438
Huh?

199
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,522
Oh.

200
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,651
That's it. Right there.

201
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,820
DISCLAIMER OF PHYSICAL RIGHTS

202
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,532
You did it, huh!

203
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,326
You have one month. Take care of yourself.

204
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,829
Uh, hold on. Sir, excuse me.

205
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,167
I'm sorry to even ask but...

206
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,711
may I please borrow 10,000 won?

207
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,048
You little...

208
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,635
Forget it.

209
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,219
WINDOW CLOSED

210
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,432
Excuse me.

211
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,309
Sorry to do this.

212
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,104
Uh...

213
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,647
Can I get back that 10,000?

214
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,776
THE FUN DOESN'T END, CRANE GAME

215
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,161
Come on.

216
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,168
Ah!

217
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,802
Yeah. Come on. That's it, that's it.

218
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,637
That's right. Ah!

219
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,185
Goddamn it!

220
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,687
Excuse me, sir.

221
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,690
You need to stop and pick the prize you want first.

222
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,775
Does that help you?

223
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,664
Ah. Ah...

224
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,958
That's it. Good.

225
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,960
Yes, that's it.

226
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,878
- Oh! - Yay!

227
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,300
Yay!

228
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,930
Great job! Thank you. Thank you!

229
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,516
Yay!

230
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,316
Oh, this?

231
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,445
It's a huge mosquito bite, that's all.

232
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,282
Mosquitoes are really mean these days. Yeah.

233
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:51,288
Dad, you can be in all of the fights that you want,

234
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,457
but don't get hurt too bad.

235
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,089
I'm sorry, sweetie. I really am.

236
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,426
You know, I wanted to buy you a nicer dinner than this.

237
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,510
It's okay.

238
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,473
We went with my stepdad to a steakhouse earlier, so...

239
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,811
A steak, huh?

240
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,481
That's nice of him.

241
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,653
Well, I still want tteokbokki a lot more, though.

242
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,831
I'm not allowed to have it at home.

243
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,368
Mom says it's junk food.

244
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,705
Eat up then.

245
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,207
Oh, my gosh.

246
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,542
Surprise.

247
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,795
Ga-yeong, I got your present right here.

248
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,259
Ah...

249
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,764
Uh...

250
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,103
You know why, huh? These days, even women go to war.

251
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,229
Uh-huh.

252
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,772
I mean, when you finally get older,

253
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,817
there's not gonna be that kind of discrimination like we got now.

254
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,194
And you'll need to get used to this pretty soon, you know.

255
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,783
Ah.

256
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,829
Oh, plus, it's a lighter.

257
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,999
Looks like the real deal, doesn't it?

258
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,378
I think you'll get in trouble with Mom again

259
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,839
if she saw me holding this.

260
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,215
Is that right?

261
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,053
I'll keep it then, just till you get a little bit older. Okay?

262
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,846
Hey, don't smoke of it, though.

263
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,264
Oh, come on, I'm clean now.

264
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,898
All right. All right.

265
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:44,026
I'll make sure I'll stop smoking for real.

266
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,696
And you'll see next year, huh, I'll get an awesome present for you, okay?

267
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,865
Ga-yeong, I swear.

268
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,201
Next year?

269
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,827
Last year, you had a birthday.

270
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,454
This one came right around, right?

271
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,914
And the next one will be quick.

272
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,458
Um, Dad?

273
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,794
Hmm? Shoot.

274
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,882
Nothing.

275
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,262
Okay. Come on, come on. Have more tteokbokki.

276
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,599
Excuse me, sir, one more order, okay?

277
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,518
And mix it with some of that in.

278
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,115
Why did you bring her back so late?

279
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,495
She's not dressed for the cold.

280
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,081
Oh, she got sleepy, I carried her.

281
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,917
We're ten minutes late at most. Okay?

282
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,752
I said I'd drive down to get her, didn't I?

283
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,046
It's her birthday. Let's not yell.

284
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,090
Mom.

285
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,300
- Oh. - Hey, Ga-yeong, hey, get down.

286
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,095
I'll carry her to the elevator if you don't mind, okay?

287
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,471
She can walk on her own.

288
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,556
Mom...

289
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,183
- Ga-yeong, get down. - Ah, jeez. Seriously.

290
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,644
All right. Let's go.

291
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,111
Bye, Dad.

292
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,738
Go on in. Good night.

293
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,834
Ah, wait a minute! Hey, open the door!

294
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,294
Ah, shit!

295
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,200
Hello, sir.

296
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,367
Can I talk to you?

297
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,123
I don't believe in Jesus.

298
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,584
It's not that.

299
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,171
Listen, I wanna let you in on a great opportunity to...

300
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,848
I come from a very long line of Buddhists, so find another guy to preach to,

301
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,559
Mister.

302
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,813
Would you like to play a game with me?

303
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,234
Who are you?

304
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,861
Salesman, huh?

305
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,115
You people have all kinds of tactics.

306
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:41,036
And I know you're only doing your job, but I really don't have time to sit here...

307
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,585
I'm sure you've played ddakji before, right?

308
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,112
Play a few round of ddakji with me.

309
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,925
And each time you win, I'll pay you a 100,000 won.

310
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,935
Wait, so if I hit your ddakji, and it flips over,

311
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,646
I get a 100,000 won?

312
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,316
And if I can flip yours, you will give me the exact same amount of money.

313
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,532
You can also be the first to play.

314
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,415
Hey, look, I had a bad day today.

315
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,420
You pull a scam or you rip me off, well, then, I'll... I'll kill you, huh?

316
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,840
So then it's my turn, eh?

317
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,344
So which color do you wanna play as?

318
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,645
Shh...

319
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,337
Well, what's wrong?

320
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,547
So the thing is...

321
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,134
How about you use your body to pay?

322
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,094
A what?

323
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,097
What the hell, man?

324
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,350
I'll take a 100 grand off per slap.

325
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,773
One more round.

326
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,163
One more round.

327
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,436
Oh! Ah!

328
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,929
Did you see that? I beat you, man!

329
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,932
Did you see that? I did it. I won.

330
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,019
Get over here. It's my turn to do this.

331
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,063
What are you doing, jerk?

332
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,648
Your 100 grand.

333
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,779
You're welcome, sir.

334
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,453
Oh, yeah.

335
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,912
The money.

336
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,215
You know, sir.

337
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,968
There are other games like this where you can make even more.

338
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,597
Come on, it must sound tempting.

339
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,389
Hey, dude.

340
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,684
Is this some new pyramid scheme or what?

341
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,854
Look, I'm desperate, okay?

342
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,023
Still, not that desperate yet.

343
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,197
Mr. Gi-hun.

344
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,910
Earlier, you signed away your physical rights.

345
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,915
Your name, Seong Gi-hun. 47 years old.

346
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,708
You attended Daehan Technical High School.

347
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,252
Worked at Dragon Motors, Assembly Team One.

348
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,896
The company laid you off ten years ago.

349
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,923
Opened a chicken shop, and then a small snack bar.

350
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,425
Both of them failed, you're working as a chauffeur right now.

351
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,344
You've been divorced for about three years,

352
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,179
and your daughter is ten years old.

353
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,432
A hundred and sixty million won owed just to loan sharks,

354
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,185
and you owe 250 more to the bank.

355
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,232
Who are you?

356
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,944
What business of yours is all that?

357
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,076
We don't have many spots left.

358
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,039
Just think about it.

359
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,989
All right, then.

360
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,454
- ♪ I got thirsty ♪ - You drink at all tonight?

361
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,373
No.

362
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,710
I haven't had a drop, but I feel tipsy still, anyway.

363
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:26,673
Because look what I got.

364
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,218
Gi-hun, what did you do now? You gambled again?

365
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,304
Don't you look at me like that. I didn't.

366
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,806
I earned it all this time. It's all legit.

367
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,570
What's with your face, by the way?

368
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,643
- What'd they try to beat you up for now? - Hey.

369
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,727
Forget it.

370
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,563
Sang-woo been around here?

371
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,064
How's he doing at work?

372
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,566
Always keeping busy.

373
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,152
Right now, he's on a business trip abroad.

374
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,529
Ah, ungrateful prick.

375
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,240
Tell him to give me a call when he gets back in town.

376
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,867
After all I did?

377
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,328
He got into Seoul National University, thanks to me.

378
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,705
I used to take him to school when we were young.

379
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,334
That's why he went to school, got a good job.

380
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,169
He at least ought to buy me a drink.

381
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,464
What are you talking about now? Here, take this home, okay?

382
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,132
Not to a bar. Go straight home.

383
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,551

Are you hungry? Huh?

391
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,668
Here.

392
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,587
Come on.

393
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,923
You have to finish it, okay?

394
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,717
I got that with the money I made getting slapped, so enjoy it.

395
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,556

Come on. Take it.

400
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,702
Hold on.

401
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,663
Were you out gambling again?

402
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,832
Of course not.

403
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,627
Wait a minute. What did you do to your face?

404
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,505
Answer me right now!

405
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,299
It was nothing like that!

406
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:37,178
Hold on. Are you saying this money is stolen?

407
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,390
I didn't steal anything, Mom. I earned it all.

408
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:45,895
I worked, okay. All day, I worked my hands and face off to earn this money for us.

409
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,064
Oh, gosh.

410
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:58,992
So did you get fried chicken for Ga-yeong?

411
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,953
Yes, I got her dinner...

412
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,290
and my present and everything. It was nice.

413
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,168
And did anything come up tonight?

414
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:10,920
Like what?

415
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:17,927
Ga-yeong, her mother, and her stepdad are all going somewhere.

416
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,972
They're moving to the US next year.

417
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:26,144
And you'll see next year, huh. I'll get an awesome present for you. Okay?

418
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,396
Ga-yeong, I swear.

419
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,066
Next year?

420
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,484
The US?

421
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,028
That's right.

422
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:39,032
Her stepdad's job begins soon and needs him to go.

423
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:43,036
So the entire family is going to move there.

424
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,458
I see.

425
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,505
You hear me? How can you eat anything right now, huh?

426
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,091
You need to get your daughter to stay here.

427
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,095
And how do I do that?

428
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,183
We're done. We settled that when we agreed to the divorce.

429
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,899
I talked to that young man upstairs who knows the law,

430
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:17,320
and he said that the father has to show the child

431
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,907
will have financial support, and when you can prove that...

432
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,285
then you can take custody. Huh?

433
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,582
If she moves to the US, you know what will happen?

434
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,334
She'll forget how to speak Korean.

435
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,254
She won't be able to talk to you like she can right now.

436
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:37,215
You're going to become a stranger to her.

437
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,511
Are you sure that you...

438
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,474
can really keep going without seeing your little girl?

439
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,672
Ah, shh...

440
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,361
Hello. Who's calling?

441
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,280
Hello.

442
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,450
You gave me your business card earlier.

443
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,702
Do you wish to participate in the game?

444
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,915
If you wish to participate, please state your name and birthdate.

445
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,404
Mr. Seong Gi-hun?

446
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,658
Uh, yeah.

447
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:27,909
Password?

448
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,582
Red light, green light. That's the password.

449
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,260
Ah...

450
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:52,308
I guess everyone is...

451
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,978
pretty tired. Um...

452
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,897
How long will it take to get to the...

453
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,608
game venue or whatever?

454
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,594
Mm...

455
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,931
What?

456
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,961
- Fifty... Fifty-two... - What the...

457
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,840
- Fifty-five, fifty-six. - Excuse me, sir.

458
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,385
- And then, there are those... - What are you doing?

459
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,929
Stop talking to me or I lose count.

460
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:57,558
And so I was at 50, so the...

461
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:01,024
Ah, you must be trying to count how many of us there are, is that right?

462
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,940
That's right. So could you stop talking to me for a while?

463
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,734
And then... Huh?

464
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,653
Hold on.

465
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,863
Where was I just then?

466
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,785
Up on the board, sir. There are 456 here.

467
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,580
Oh. Look, that means you were given the number one.

468
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,290
And I'm... Oh.

469
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,626
I'm the last.

470
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,505
I know all that too.

471
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,216
I'm just counting the numbers.

472
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:35,638
My doctor said counting is good so I don't get dementia or anything.

473
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,474
If dementia's a concern for you, then what are you doing here?

474
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,878
I think you'd wanna stay at home,

475
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,854
let your daughter-in-law cook your meals for you.

476
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,396
Go sit on a coffee chair somewhere.

477
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,898
- And look at your grandkids, I think. - You think so?

478
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,692
What about both of your parents?

479
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:51,362
Do they get nice food cooked by their daughter-in-law all day long?

480
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,536
I don't have much time left now.

481
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,203
Huh?

482
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,707
The doctor said there's a...

483
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,377
a lump inside over here. Growing every day.

484
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,963
Your... your head?

485
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,173
Brain tumor.

486
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,094
You little shit!

487
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,405
Stop them!

488
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,182
Hey!

489
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,558
Wow.

490
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,020
It really is a small world, huh!

491
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,315
Look at those eyes. You still have that temper, huh.

492
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,025
Then again...

493
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,862
nobody broke your spirit, you could always take a hit.

494
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,530
I took care of you,

495
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,575
I fed you, I taught you when you had nowhere else.

496
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,368
This is what I get?

497
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,163
You took more from me than whatever I might possibly owe.

498
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,416
If all of that's true, how come you ran then?

499
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,586
Well, I didn't. I went independent.

500
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:51,130
Hmm.

501
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,091
"Independent"?

502
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,737
Independent, huh? Are you some kind of activist?

503
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,280
Come on then, go wave a flag.

504
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,907
Oh, that's right.

505
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,744
You're from North Korea, huh? Then wave theirs. Hmm?

506
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,412
Damn you!

507
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,332
Hey, you come here. Hold still.

508
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,084
Oh. That scar on your neck.

509
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,687
You're the damn pickpocket! You loser.

510
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,130
My money, give it back. Where is it?

511
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,966
You took it. I need it... Ah!

512
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,968
What the hell?

513
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:38,969
Who are you?

514
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,723
- Uh... - What do you think you're doing?

515
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,600
Me? Uh, well... Look.

516
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,979
The name's Seong Gi-hun. I live in Ssangmun-dong.

517
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,105
Hey, Ssangmun-dong shit.

518
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,273
Yeah?

519
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,525
This little bitch and I weren't done talking.

520
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:56,112
Yeah, I understand that. It's just there's something that me and this...

521
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,530
woman should talk about urgently.

522
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,157
You bastard!

523
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,616
What scheme are you two running?

524
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,994
You're asking me?

525
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,121
What's your problem with this girl, 101?

526
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,915
Yeah, I'll bet that, that you're a thug who preys on girls

527
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,250
that takes advantage of them.

528
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,460
Did you tell her to rob me like that?

529
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,938
- You little son of a bitch! - Get away! Hey!

530
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,481
Hey, he wants to hit me.

531
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,257
This thug is trying to hit me, huh!

532
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,342
Hey, somebody get over here! We need help!

533
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,094
Oh! Oh, there they are!

534
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,221
Over here. She'll pick all our pockets, sir.

535
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,465
Him too. They'll pick, they'll pick...

536
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,627
I would like to extend a heartfelt welcome to you all.

537
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,590
Everyone here will participate in six different games over six days.

538
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:02,553
Those who win all six games will receive a handsome cash prize.

539
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,014
And why should we believe that?

540
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,142
Y-You took all our stuff and put us to sleep coming here,

541
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,186
and then you brought us to this strange warehouse.

542
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,481
Now you're saying you'll pay us if we go and play a few games?

543
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,399
You really expect us to buy that?

544
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,753
We reluctantly took all of those measures

545
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,863
to maintain confidentiality as we brought you here.

546
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,242
We'll return everything once the games are over.

547
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:28,329
You all... you all have masks. Why are you wearing those things?

548
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,373
We do not disclose the faces

549
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:33,501
and personal information of our staff to any of the participants.

550
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,713
It's a measure we take to ensure fair games and confidentiality.

551
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,090
Please understand.

552
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,092
Well, I don't believe you one bit. You got that?

553
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,928
You tricked us. We were kidnapped.

554
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,305
You can make as many excuses as you want

555
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,683
to make sure nobody knows you broke the law in here.

556
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,604
If you're going to make up for that, then we're gonna need something more.

557
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,939
Player 218, Cho Sang-woo.

558
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,150
Age, 46 years.

559
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,903
Former team leader of Team Two at Joy Investments.

560
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,787
Siphoned money off from his clients' balances,

561
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,325
then invested it in derivatives and futures options and failed.

562
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,828
Current loss, 650 million won.

563
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,247
107, Kim Mi-ok, 540 million in debt.

564
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,416
118, Oh Yeong-uk, 1.02 billion in debt.

565
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,252
322, Jung Min-tae, 880 million in debt.

566
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,754
119, No Sang-hun, 1.39 billion in debt.

567
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,674
369, Park Ju-un, 900 million in debt.

568
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:27,305
Every person standing here in this room is living on the brink of financial ruin.

569
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,016
You all have debts that you can't pay off.

570
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:35,021
When we first went to see each of you, not a single one of you trusted us.

571
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,107
But as you all know, we played a game,

572
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,818
and as we promised, gave you money when you won.

573
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,279
And suddenly, everyone here trusted us.

574
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:48,200
You called and volunteered to participate in this game of your own free will.

575
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,118
So this is it.

576
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:52,079
I'll give you one last chance to choose.

577
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,752
Will you go back to living your old and depressing lives

578
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,712
getting chased by your creditors?

579
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:04,175
Or will you act and seize this last opportunity we're offering here?

580
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,973
Hey! Which games are we playing here?

581
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,617
In order to play fair,

582
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,561
we cannot disclose any information about the games ahead of time.

583
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,229
One question.

584
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,483
If we win, just how much do we get?

585
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,496
Your prize money will be accumulated in there after every game.

586
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:40,753
We will disclose the amount to everyone after the first game is over.

587
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:46,175
If you do not wish to participate, then please let us know at this time.

588
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,874
PLAYER CONSENT FORM

589
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,210
CLAUSE 1: A PLAYER IS NOT ALLOWED TO STOP PLAYING

590
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,838
CLAUSE 2: A PLAYER WHO REFUSES TO PLAY WILL BE ELIMINATED

591
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,424
CLAUSE 3: GAMES MAY BE TERMINATED IF THE MAJORITY AGREES

592
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,968
So then, is that it or...

593
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:51,490
SIGNATURE, SEONG GI-HUN

594
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,496
Attention, all players. The first game is about to begin.

595
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,541
Please follow the staff's instructions.

596
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,127
Please make your way towards the game hall.

597
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,675
Dude, look.

598
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,970
Wow, this place is gigantic.

599
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,349
Please look into the camera. Smile.

600
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,274
Please look into the camera.

601
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,234
Smile.

602
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:29,777
Ah, shit.

603
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,156
- Hey, move it. - Ah, shh!

604
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,258
Please look into the camera.

605
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,540
Smile.

606
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,063
Identity verified.

607
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,466
Hey, Sang-woo!

608
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,053
Oh, Sang-woo, my man!

609
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,640
What happened? What the hell are you doing here?

610
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,476
Uh, your mother and I were talking the other day.

611
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,770
She told you were out of the country on a business trip.

612
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,857
What was that guy talking about, huh?

613
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,692
You can't be in debt?

614
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,278
The same Sang-woo who attends SNU, right?

615
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,547
Attention, all players.

616
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,757
- After you enter the game hall... - We'll talk about it later.

617
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,034
...please stand behind the white line drawn on the field

618
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,119
and await further instructions.

619
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:47,082
Once again, will all players please stand behind the white line

620
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,084
and await further instructions.

621
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,228
This is the Front Man speaking.

622
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,773
Preparations for the first game are complete.

623
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,816
We can begin now.

624
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,309
- Hey. - Huh?

625
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,228
What's that? Over there.

626
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,146
Looks really freaky.

627
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,375
Damn, that thing has a freaking huge head.

628
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,859
Here is the first game.

629
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,445
You will be playing Red Light, Green Light.

630
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:05,369
You are allowed to move forward when "it" shouts out, "Green Light,"

631
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,621
stop when "it" shouts, "Red Light."

632
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:11,750
If your movement is detected afterward, you will be eliminated.

633
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,794
Red Light, Green Light?

634
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,339
The thing we did as kids in the playground?

635
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,259
- Let me repeat the rule. - I think that's what she said.

636
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,486
Red Light, Green Light?

637
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,238
- Is this a joke? - You're allowed to move...

638
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,697
- Do you think they're serious? - ...when "it" shouts out, "Green Light."

639
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:27,158
- Well then, bet on the first one there? - Stop when "it" shouts, "Red Light."

640
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,268
If your movement is detected afterward,

641
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,954
- you will be eliminated. - A million won.

642
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,104
Deal?

643
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,690
Goddamn it.

644
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:35,773
You're on!

645
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,253
Those players who cross the finish line

646
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,946
without being eliminated within the five-minute playtime

647
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,322
will pass this round.

648
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,658
With that, let the game begin.

649
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,328
Green Light.

650
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,167
Red Light.

651
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,377
Whoa.

652
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,255
Player 324. Eliminated.

653
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,924
Dumbass got caught.

654
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:06,805
That bang.

655
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,308
Did you hear that?

656
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,567
Green Light.

657
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,571
Red Light.

658
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,743
Hey, you got eliminated, idiot.

659
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,578
You can stop with the act.

660
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,326
I will now repeat the rules.

661
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,831
You are allowed to move forward when "it" shouts out, "Green Light"

662
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,791
stop when "it" shouts, "Red Light."

663
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:03,338
If your movement is detected afterward, you will be eliminated.

664
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,886
I will repeat the rules again.

665
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:14,016
You can move forward when "it" shouts out, "Green Light,"

666
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,559
stop when "it" shouts, "Red Light."

667
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:20,939
If your movement is detected afterward, you will be eliminated.

668
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,901
With that, let the game resume.

669
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,320
Green Light.

670
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,532
Red Light.

671
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,249
Green Light.

672
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,587
Red Light.

673
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:47,716
Green Light.

674
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:51,511
Red Light.

675
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,892
Green Light.

676
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,436
Red Light.

677
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,984
Gi-hun, don't look back. Just listen.

678
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,904
You can't stay there much longer.

679
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,580
I think that doll senses when you move around.

680
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,243
You won't get caught if you're behind somebody else.

681
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,204
Green Light.

682
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,499
Red Light.

683
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,550
That timer.

684
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,683
Green Light.

685
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,809
Red Light.

686
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,696
Green Light.

687
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,073
Red Light.

688
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,791
Green Light.

689
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,126
Red Light.

690
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,130
Who is that? I hear you.

691
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,716
The bitch who crossed you.

692
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,528
You little shithead.

693
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,264
Want me to cross you one last time?

694
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,432
Let go of me.

695
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,100
Please.

696
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,768
Quit trembling, you jerk.

697
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,353
He'll kill you if you get caught.

698
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,896
Green Light.

699
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,148
Red Light.

700
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,324
Green Light.

701
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,409
Red Light.

702
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,662
Help, please. I don't wanna die.

703
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,998
Let go. What are you doing?

704
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,207
Please, help.

705
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,419
Help me.

706
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,130
Green Light.

707
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:51,882
Red Light.

708
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,805
Green Light.

709
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,098
