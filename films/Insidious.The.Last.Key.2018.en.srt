1
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,397
Lights out!

2
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,380
<i>...struggle which followed
the death of Lenin...</i>

3
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,799
<i>...Joseph Stalin prevailed.</i>

4
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:17,679
<i>Stalin was the new face
of an old idea: Marxism.</i>

5
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:21,224
<i>While the Bolsheviks firmly established
their authority at home...</i>

6
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,228
<i>...the Comintern fomented revolution
throughout the world.</i>

7
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,064
<i>Communism was on the march.</i>

8
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,483
<i>Stalin was in the Kremlin.</i>

9
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,402
<i>But what of the common people?</i>

10
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,237
<i>What of the proletariat?</i>

11
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,574
<i>Those who fought to win a new world?</i>

12
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,660
<i>If we look at the history...</i>

13
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,583
They're frying someone, Pop.

14
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,710
You're on the Hades Express, mister.

15
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,295
Quiet.

16
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,922
Death is nothing to celebrate.

17
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,259
- Don't matter who it is.
- He just died.

18
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,094
His name was Wayne Fisher.

19
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:02,515
He was 32 years old,
and he killed a lady with a hammer.

20
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,977
He had a rib eye for his last meal.

21
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,938
He's been on death row
at Dewbend for three years.

22
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,361
- And his last words were, "Go to hell."
- How do you know that?

23
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,612
It's just in my head.

24
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,324
All right. It's past your bedtime,
children.

25
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,534
Go brush your teeth
and go to bed, please.

26
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,205
<i>And history always repeats, my friends.</i>

27
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,625
<i>The ghosts of their past
will soon become our present...</i>

28
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,419
<i>...if we do not confront them head-on.</i>

29
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:44,182
Elise, I thought I told you
to put all these toys away.

30
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,976
You're not listening to me.

31
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,187
It wasn't me who made this mess.

32
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,730
Then who was it?

33
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,237
Christian, shut the door, please.

34
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,827
You can tell me.

35
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,748
It was the little boy.

36
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,419
He lived here a long time ago,
and he loves playing with our toys.

37
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,255
- I swear.
- I believe you.

38
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,506
I do.

39
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,386
You know,
you've been blessed with a gift.

40
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,138
You're special.

41
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,349
Some people are afraid
of special people.

42
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,936
Your daddy, he's one of them.

43
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,065
He doesn't understand your gift.

44
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,235
You just keep it between us
from now on, okay?

45
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,447
Okay.

46
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,161
It's time for bed.

47
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,626
- Good night.
- Don't turn off the light, Mom.

48
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,008
I'm gonna be right out there, honey.

49
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,844
And if you ever get scared,
what do you do?

50
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,305
That's right.

51
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:09,642
I gave you this, so that if you ever
get scared, you can go:

52
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,647
Wherever I am, I'll come running.
But you gotta save it...

53
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,984
- ...for when you really need me, okay?
- Okay.

54
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,238
I love you both so much.

55
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,033
- Love you too, Mommy.
- Love you, Mommy.

56
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,378
<i>We see an actual atomic bombing run.</i>

57
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,964
<i>Heading for the target is Bockscar,
code name for the ship.</i>

58
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,174
<i>The radio navigator...</i>

59
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,885
Hey.

60
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,345
What?

61
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,597
You asleep yet?

62
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,349
No.

63
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:55,313
Do you ever think about the people
who go to the electric chair?

64
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,359
Sometimes.

65
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:05,990
Do you wonder where they go
after it's done?

66
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,617
No.

67
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,704
I know where they go.

68
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,539
Oh, yeah?

69
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,207
Where?

70
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,505
They go into the dark.

71
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,315
Christian?

72
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,233
What are you doing?

73
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,180
Elise.

74
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,866
You made all the mess, didn't you?

75
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,495
Yes.

76
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,752
Where's my whistle?

77
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,006
The boy is in the closet.

78
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,426
It's okay.

79
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,927
We won't hurt you.

80
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,847
Come on out.

81
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,266
Stop it, Elise.

82
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,436
Come on out.

83
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,231
I'm not in the closet.

84
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,116
<i>The people took their revenge.</i>

85
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,036
Gerald. Gerald, no.

86
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,663
What have you done, Elise?

87
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,043
- Put your hands on the wall.
- Leave her alone.

88
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,544
Quiet, Audrey!

89
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,678
Did you see a ghost?

90
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,513
Gerald, stop it.

91
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,182
Yes.

92
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,022
I don't want to hurt you, girl.

93
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,192
Just say no. That's all you have to do.

94
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,569
I'm just gonna ask you again.

95
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,447
Did you see a ghost?

96
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:33,656
Yes, I did.

97
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,576
They're all around us in this house.

98
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,120
They're everywhere.

99
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,332
You don't have to do this. Please.

100
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,793
She's just a little girl, Gerald. Please.

101
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,379
No. No, Daddy.

102
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,672
No, no.

103
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,717
No, no, no. Take me. Please take me.

104
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,929
- Help me.
- Please, please, please. Gerald, stop!

105
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,390
- Please, honey, she's had enough.
- Don't. Stop.

106
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,933
Please don't. No.

107
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,228
Don't tell me how to punish her.
I punish people for a living.

108
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,562
Please!

109
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,147
Please, not in there.

110
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,441
No, no, no.

111
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,236
No, Daddy!

112
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,072
No. Daddy, please,
I don't wanna go in there!

113
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,282
No, not in there.

114
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,910
No, Daddy, please, not in there!

115
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,538
Daddy, let me out! Daddy, please!

116
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,289
You can either follow my rules...

117
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,668
...and sleep under my roof or you can
break them and sleep under my floor.

118
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,253
Don't put me in here, Daddy.

119
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,629
Daddy, please.

120
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,091
Daddy, come back.
I don't wanna be in here alone.

121
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,468
Daddy, please!

122
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,263
Are you scared of the dark?

123
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,767
Who is that? Who's there?

124
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,774
Don't be afraid.

125
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,402
I can make it light.

126
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,718
Who is that?

127
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,512
Why are you down here?

128
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,848
My daddy put me down here.

129
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:48,643
Your daddy doesn't treat you right.

130
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,395
Open this door.

131
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,981
There'll be lots of light.

132
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,359
Go on. Open it.

133
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,988
There's a key hanging up right there.

134
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,949
Take your time. I can wait.

135
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,786
You're the only one
that can open the door.

136
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,248
You are more powerful than you know.

137
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:14,210
I want you to help me open all the doors.

138
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:33,540
<i>Don't forget what Bill the turtle just did,
everyone...</i>

139
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,876
<i>...because we might have to do
the same thing.</i>

140
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,546
<i>That's what this is all about, my friends.</i>

141
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,381
<i>Duck and cover.</i>

142
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,883
<i>This is an official civil defence film...</i>

143
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,386
<i>...produced in cooperation
with the Federal Civil...</i>

144
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,728
Elise?

145
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,777
<i>...for the ultimate...</i>

146
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,834
Elise?

147
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,058
Audrey?

148
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,187
Audrey.

149
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,482
Audrey!

150
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,068
No, no, Audrey. Audrey, no.

151
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:46,196
No. No. No.

152
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,991
No, Audrey!

153
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,910
I'm sorry.

154
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,662
No!

155
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,498
No!

156
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,763
Good morning.

157
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,349
The dreams are coming back, Warren.

158
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,020
Just won't go away, will it?

159
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,565
How would you like breakfast in bed?

160
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:06,151
I thought so.

161
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:10,780
- You're getting old, Warren. We both are.
- I've been studying last week's footage...

162
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,615
...from the church.
We missed something.

163
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,409
There is movement in the frame.

164
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,954
- Look.
- It's a piece of lint.

165
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:22,083
- Lint doesn't walk across the room.
- Behold.

166
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,545
The reason I was up all night.

167
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,840
The lights.

168
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,011
That's right, my friends.
It's voice activated.

169
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:36,639
No more dealing with pesky switches,
having to find them in the dark...

170
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,850
...straining fingers as you switch them.

171
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:41,227
Yeah, that was a real problem before,
you know.

172
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,688
Toil in the darkness of sarcasm,
my friend.

173
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:48,443
I prefer to work in the lights.

174
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,366
The lights?

175
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,910
Lights!

176
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,790
Bad acoustics.

177
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:06,252
Natural light's better
for the environment anyway. VoilГ.

178
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,672
I love that you boys are staying
in the house.

179
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:12,592
But please don't try to fix anything else
that isn't broken.

180
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,848
Spectral Sightings.

181
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,267
Yes, she is.

182
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,894
Elise!

183
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,065
<i>- This is Elise.
- Hey there. My name is Ted Garza.</i>

184
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,192
Nice to meet you, Mr Garza.

185
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,903
<i>Yeah. I'm having some problems.</i>

186
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,197
<i>Things are happening in my house...</i>

187
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,158
<i>...and they say
that you know about this stuff.</i>

188
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,743
I know some things.

189
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,372
<i>Yeah, well, I was wondering
if you could take a look.</i>

190
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:47,127
<i>I need... I need help is the thing, see.</i>

191
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,795
May I ask where you live?

192
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:53,550
<i>I live at 414 Appletree Road...</i>

193
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,636
<i>...Five Keys, New Mexico.</i>

194
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,356
Mr Garza...

195
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:12,068
...I wish I could help you,
but I really can't.

196
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,987
I'm so sorry.

197
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:17,323
I thank you very much
for thinking of me.

198
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,685
Sorry to drag you boys out of bed.

199
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:49,439
That man who called today about a job...

200
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:56,488
...he told me he lives in the house
that I grew up in.

201
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,534
I call it a house because it wasn't a...
A home.

202
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,795
I don't have memories from that place.
I have scars.

203
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,176
This gift I have
that you boys are so in awe of...

204
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,555
...my father tried to beat it out of me.

205
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,184
And...

206
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:27,894
...my mother...

207
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,980
...she was killed in that house.

208
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:35,151
She was murdered by something
that I brought into this world.

209
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:39,030
This demon wants to use my abilities...

210
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:41,616
...and it will hurt the ones I love
to get to me.

211
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,285
That's why I never want to go
into The Further...

212
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,538
...like I did for Quinn.

213
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:50,458
I have spent my life fighting
these things...

214
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:54,379
...because I can never forget the look
on my mother's face when she died.

215
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,049
So...

216
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,720
...I have to help this man...

217
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,849
...because I know what he's up against.

218
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:10,562
We'll pack up the truck tonight.
We'll get an early start tomorrow.

219
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,480
Not this time.

220
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,859
This one, I have to do...

221
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,236
...alone.

222
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:06,951
We have to come with you now.
This cost us 700 bucks.

223
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:10,080
Plus 200 for the logo paint job.

224
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,432
Before we go inside...

225
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,976
...I brought some clothes for you boys.

226
00:23:56,686 --> 00:24:00,815
Some of it belonged to Jack,
and it's very important to me.

227
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,695
I bet I can guess who you are.

228
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,073
There's no need. I'm Elise.

229
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,367
- Hi.
- And this is Specs and Tucker...

230
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:11,868
...my associates.

231
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,870
She's psychic.

232
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,164
We're sidekick.

233
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:18,083
Where's that?

234
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,252
She's psychic. We're sidekick.

235
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:26,299
- Sorry, I'm... I'm not understanding.
- Yeah, never mind.

236
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,344
You wanna come in? Here.

237
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:32,180
Come on. I'm supposed
to invite you in. Come on.

238
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,432
Hello.

239
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,485
<i>...aggression.</i>

240
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:48,655
<i>And history always repeats, my friends.</i>

241
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:52,158
<i>The ghosts of their past
will soon become our present...</i>

242
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,952
<i>...if we do not confront them...</i>

243
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,162
You still have so much of our old stuff.

244
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,289
It was all here.

245
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,710
Pretty good stuff, you know?

246
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,962
I didn't see any reason to get rid of it.

247
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,673
There's stories.

248
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,259
About your family.

249
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:12,053
I never listened to them
when they said that...

250
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,556
...this wasn't a place that I should live.

251
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:17,684
You know, I looked at it,
and I just saw a little house.

252
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,105
I said, "Screw the stories,"
and I bought it.

253
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:27,944
Now I believe the stories.

254
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,535
You getting anything?

255
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:39,914
There are so many spirits,
it's hard to tell the good from the evil.

256
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,917
A lot of people died in that prison.

257
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,878
When did these occurrences start?

258
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,422
Soon after I moved in.

259
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:52,761
First, it was...

260
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:55,013
...the little things, you know?

261
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:56,848
Things that...

262
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:03,438
<i>You've been blessed with a gift.</i>

263
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:22,207
<i>You're special.</i>

264
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,627
<i>You just keep it between us
from now on, okay?</i>

265
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:29,255
<i>No. No!</i>

266
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:33,218
You okay?

267
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,224
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

268
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:42,310
These experiences you're having...

269
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:44,187
Where do they mainly occur?

270
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:48,483
Mostly in one room.

271
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,861
I keep it locked now.

272
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,823
I haven't opened it in three months.

273
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,663
I'll take that one.

274
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,998
You wanna give me a hand?

275
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,168
That's good.

276
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:11,089
A little bit more.

277
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,577
Sorry.

278
00:27:40,744 --> 00:27:42,662
Can't go in there.

279
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,884
When it first started...

280
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,472
...I could hear somebody
just walking back and forth.

281
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,309
Someone was talking to themselves.

282
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,989
You think you're going crazy,
and then you...

283
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:20,450
...you actually hear it.

284
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,704
And you know you're not.

285
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:27,999
Finally, one day, I walked in...

286
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,293
...and I screamed at it:

287
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,545
"You stop."

288
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,466
"You stop.

289
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:38,968
Please stop."

290
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:43,640
My whole life savings is in this place.

291
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:45,392
You gotta help me.

292
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,227
You gotta help me, please.

293
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,063
That's what we do.

294
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:57,404
The camera is so we can see
what she sees from out in the truck.

295
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,324
We call it the "Winneba-ghost."

296
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:09,290
I think I'm gonna go there now.

297
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,762
You really are gonna stay here
all alone?

298
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:28,476
My presence tends to draw the spirits
out of their dark, little corners.

299
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,689
You need to take this.

300
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:35,984
Thank you.

301
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:38,403
Good night.

302
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,344
Can you hear us, Elise?

303
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:07,891
Yes. Try not to drown out
the other voices.

304
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:10,477
<i>We got you. We gone.</i>

305
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,396
Here you go.

306
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,691
- What's this?
- Lights.

307
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:19,527
Thanks.

308
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,318
I thought you were gone forever.

309
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,573
<i>My mother got this for my brother...</i>

310
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,035
...and he lost it
when he was 6 years old.

311
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:01,463
Safe now.

312
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:20,518
- Stop.
- What?

313
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:22,020
Go back, to the left.

314
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:27,817
- What?
- Yeah, nothing.

315
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:29,986
Thought I saw some feet.

316
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:31,321
Feet?

317
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,808
Elise, there's someone
right in front of you.

318
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:03,353
<i>Looks like a woman.</i>

319
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,063
I don't see anything.

320
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:08,858
<i>Elise, be careful.</i>

321
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,117
I don't see what you're seeing.

322
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:22,664
<i>You're going to touch it.</i>

323
00:35:23,832 --> 00:35:24,833
Be careful.

324
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:30,422
Help her.

325
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:38,096
Elise? Elise? What happened?

326
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:40,849
The whistle.

327
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:43,059
It took the whistle.

328
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:45,562
What were you doing in there?

329
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:48,398
Thought you were gonna stay
in the bedroom.

330
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:50,400
Something led me down there.

331
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:52,402
The spirit of a woman.

332
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:56,906
I don't know why she said, "Help her,"
but it's a ghost I have seen before...

333
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:59,034
...in this house.

334
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:03,580
When I was 16 years old.

335
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,604
Did you hear that?

336
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:28,938
Hear what?

337
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,733
There's someone in the laundry room.

338
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,401
No, there isn't.

339
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:35,612
I heard it.

340
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:37,113
I'm gonna go look.

341
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,866
No. Don't, Elise.

342
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:47,624
Hello.

343
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:51,336
I live here with my brother, Christian.

344
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:54,005
- What's your name?
- Stop it.

345
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:56,049
You're making it up.

346
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,387
Come out and see my brother.
He doesn't believe that you're here.

347
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,055
Christian!

348
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:10,397
What are you doing, girl?

349
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:13,108
There's someone in the laundry.

350
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:24,828
There's no one in here.

351
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:30,125
You're doing it again.

352
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:36,798
You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it. I never asked for it.

353
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,344
If there's one thing...

354
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,973
...you've been doing
your whole life, Elise...

355
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,391
...it's ask for it.

356
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:00,947
I won't let you hurt me anymore.

357
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,286
Please!

358
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:08,788
Elise.

359
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:11,458
Elise!

360
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:16,421
Elise, don't go!

361
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:22,093
Leave her be. Leave her be.

362
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:27,182
She needs to learn that nobody else
can possibly love someone like her.

363
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,735
I haven't been back here since.

364
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:48,078
I think that's all for tonight.

365
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:50,121
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

366
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:57,587
Christian and I came here a lot as kids.

367
00:38:58,046 --> 00:38:59,923
Do I look okay?

368
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,800
Yeah, of course.

369
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:13,853
All right.

370
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,532
I'm sorry. I...

371
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:28,243
You just look so much
like someone I know very well.

372
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,036
Oh, really?

373
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:31,996
I'm Elise.

374
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:33,289
Melissa.

375
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:34,624
Imogen.

376
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:37,502
- And you're sisters.
- Yes, we are.

377
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,295
Tucker.

378
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:41,006
Specs.

379
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:43,550
I'm Specs. Or Steven.

380
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:44,968
Whatever. Your choice.

381
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:47,303
She's psychic, and we're sidekick.

382
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:49,222
I'm sorry?

383
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:51,891
Forget it.

384
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:54,853
- So are you guys visiting the area?
- Tough to talk about.

385
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,897
<i>Actually, it's pretty confidencial.</i>

386
00:39:58,064 --> 00:40:00,859
It's a poltergeist infestation
involving Ted Garza.

387
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:03,570
Do you know him?
He lives, like, down the road or...?

388
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:06,197
Ghosts and ghouls.

389
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:08,533
What he's trying to say
is we're ghost hunters.

390
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,410
The three of us.

391
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:12,120
Kind of like cops.

392
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:14,289
Only we don't arrest humans.

393
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:18,043
I'm funny too. A lot of the time.

394
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:20,253
- I can also be funny. What?
- Okay. Okay.

395
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,589
- I think that that's enough, boys.
- Oh, yeah?

396
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,510
I used to live in this town
a long time ago.

397
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:29,888
Well, good for you. You got out.

398
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:33,933
I'm really making a fool out of myself.
We're making...

399
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,602
No, you're not.

400
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:38,396
It's really nice to meet you.

401
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:41,274
- Ernie, how's it hanging?
- Dad, over here.

402
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:44,027
- How are you?
- Hot enough for you?

403
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:56,247
Hello, Christian.

404
00:40:57,874 --> 00:40:59,376
Have I aged that much?

405
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:06,383
Well, aren't you gonna say anything?

406
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:08,093
I have nothing to say to you.

407
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:09,636
Girls, come on. Let's go.

408
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:11,096
- Come on.
- We just got here.

409
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:13,181
Hear me out.

410
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:16,184
I'm... I'm still your sister, and...

411
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:19,187
That only means something if I choose it
to mean something...

412
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:22,023
- ...and I choose it not to.
- Please, Christian.

413
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,402
I just want you to hear my piece.
I didn't know how this was gonna go.

414
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:28,363
- I thought you could see the future.
- Is this your sister?

415
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,990
- No, it isn't! Come on.
- Yes, yes, I am his sister.

416
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:32,534
Listen to me. You listen.

417
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:36,913
Now, when we were children,
you terrified me.

418
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,749
You scared the life out of me...

419
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:42,752
...with stories about a monster
behind a red door...

420
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:45,839
...and then you opened the door
and you left.

421
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:47,590
You left me.

422
00:41:47,757 --> 00:41:50,969
You abandoned me to a real monster,
our father.

423
00:41:51,928 --> 00:41:56,516
Look, I wish you no harm,
but you stay away from us, Elise.

424
00:41:56,683 --> 00:41:58,393
You stay away.

425
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:01,062
Christian.

426
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:09,738
Christian!

427
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:11,906
Christian!

428
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,624
I was stupid to come back here.

429
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:23,793
No, you weren't. You're helping people.

430
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,795
That's what you do, remember?

431
00:42:25,962 --> 00:42:27,672
Elise.

432
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,591
I'm sorry.

433
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:32,302
He can be unreasonable sometimes.

434
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,056
Knowing what he grew up with,
that's perfectly understandable.

435
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:38,558
He's never told us anything
about his childhood.

436
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:40,769
I've never even seen a picture.

437
00:42:40,935 --> 00:42:43,938
He never told us anything about you.

438
00:42:44,814 --> 00:42:49,235
I left him alone, and I shouldn't have.

439
00:42:49,402 --> 00:42:52,238
He is a great dad, you know?

440
00:42:52,405 --> 00:42:54,115
I love him a lot.

441
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:57,452
You have no idea how happy
that makes me, honey.

442
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:03,958
- Tucker?
- Share with me. Yes?

443
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:06,252
Do you have the still frames
that we printed?

444
00:43:06,419 --> 00:43:08,213
- Yes, I do.
- Bring them here.

445
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,549
- Eaten by the female, that's why I don't...
- Tucker?

446
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:13,551
- Tucker, I need you.
- Yes.

447
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:15,553
Come on.

448
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:24,229
Here you go.

449
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:27,524
Here. You give this to your dad...

450
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:31,027
...and you tell him it was taken
yesterday in our old bedroom.

451
00:43:31,194 --> 00:43:34,280
Oh, I think he will be
very surprised to see it.

452
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:38,743
I'm so happy to meet you.

453
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:44,541
Okay.

454
00:43:54,884 --> 00:43:56,302
Testing. One, two.

455
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:58,346
Can you hear me, guys?

456
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:02,225
- No.
- I noticed this last night...

457
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:05,186
...but I couldn't quite place it.

458
00:44:05,353 --> 00:44:08,898
Then Christian reminded me
that when I was a child...

459
00:44:09,065 --> 00:44:11,568
...I saw a red door.

460
00:44:11,735 --> 00:44:15,321
The entity that killed my mother
came through it.

461
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:21,453
I don't get it. A red door is a red door.
Anyone can see it.

462
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:23,872
No, it's not a literal door.
It's a metaphysical one.

463
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:27,417
Remember when I went into The Further
to find Quinn Brenner?

464
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:29,711
I came across a red door.

465
00:44:30,837 --> 00:44:36,468
<i>And I... I passed through it,
and it took me deeper into The Further.</i>

466
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:39,137
If I can find out what it means...

467
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:45,018
...I might be able to stop the thing
that's haunting this house.

468
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:47,437
Well, this might help.

469
00:44:54,861 --> 00:44:57,655
I spoke to you last night.

470
00:45:00,116 --> 00:45:03,036
Are you there? Can you hear me?

471
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:12,212
You took something from me.

472
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:14,005
Why?

473
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:17,217
<i>Why did you say, "Help her"?</i>

474
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:18,718
<i>Help who?</i>

475
00:45:56,172 --> 00:45:57,632
This way.

476
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:56,251
Is that you?

477
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:01,881
Whistle once for yes, twice for no.

478
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:05,135
Are you the woman I saw last night?

479
00:48:10,348 --> 00:48:13,143
Is there an entity in this house...

480
00:48:13,309 --> 00:48:16,187
...that is trying to hurt Ted Garza?

481
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:22,902
Are you that entity?

482
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:32,370
Is there something
you're trying to show me?

483
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:39,836
Is what you want to show me...

484
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:42,255
...behind this wall?

485
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:25,340
Keys.

486
00:49:35,558 --> 00:49:38,353
Freeze, buddy. Freeze.

487
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,730
On.

488
00:49:40,897 --> 00:49:42,315
Wait. On.

489
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,128
Wait.

490
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:54,721
Thank you.

491
00:51:26,878 --> 00:51:29,130
What is it you wanna show me?

492
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:12,257
Help her!

493
00:52:35,488 --> 00:52:37,490
Help me.

494
00:52:43,788 --> 00:52:45,749
That's not a ghost.

495
00:52:45,915 --> 00:52:48,251
Oh, my God.

496
00:52:50,712 --> 00:52:52,797
Oh, my God.

497
00:52:52,964 --> 00:52:54,466
I'll break the chain.

498
00:52:54,632 --> 00:52:55,925
No, you won't.

499
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:00,513
Move.

500
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:02,182
Get away from her!

501
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:06,102
I asked you, help me get rid
of the ghost.

502
00:53:06,269 --> 00:53:08,063
Help me get rid of it!

503
00:53:08,229 --> 00:53:09,939
<i>Help me!</i>

504
00:53:11,316 --> 00:53:14,444
Why did you have to come down here?

505
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:20,241
- Why?!
- Your ghost led us down here.

506
00:53:20,408 --> 00:53:22,660
He's in my head.

507
00:53:24,704 --> 00:53:26,039
He's in my head.

508
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:46,559
Is that your friend?

509
00:53:47,894 --> 00:53:50,021
That is your friend.

510
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:43,283
You there, Specs?

511
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:52,167
Specs!

512
00:54:58,214 --> 00:54:59,466
What?

513
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:11,079
Her name is Mara Jennings.

514
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:14,082
She's a nurse from a town
about 10 miles outside of here.

515
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:16,626
She's been missing
for approximately four months.

516
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,380
Watch your step down.

517
00:56:23,341 --> 00:56:27,053
- Can you stick around for a few days?
- Yeah, we'll be here.

518
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,597
I'm gonna have to get statements
from all of you.

519
00:56:39,524 --> 00:56:43,069
There are plenty of demons in this world
who are very much alive...

520
00:56:43,486 --> 00:56:45,905
...and you stopped one of them.

521
00:56:49,075 --> 00:56:51,619
Thanks, Elise.

522
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:35,538
Dad, this is crazy.

523
00:57:35,705 --> 00:57:38,333
This is something I have to do.

524
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:48,134
<i>I gotta find it.</i>

525
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:52,097
It's a little whistle, a
little silver whistle.

526
00:57:52,263 --> 00:57:56,059
Look, I deal in the spirit world...

527
00:57:56,226 --> 00:58:01,147
...and spirits can make people
do bad things in the real world.

528
00:58:01,314 --> 00:58:04,943
Some of these people come to me
for help.

529
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,612
But to you, that's weird.

530
00:58:07,779 --> 00:58:10,615
To me, it's a day job.

531
00:58:13,993 --> 00:58:15,829
This one was different though.

532
00:58:17,414 --> 00:58:20,417
The haunted house was my house.

533
00:58:23,336 --> 00:58:25,005
It's not in here.

534
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:28,174
Hey, I'm gonna check on him.

535
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:31,678
Why would Garza invite you up...

536
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:35,223
...knowing the risk
that you might discover Mara?

537
00:58:40,895 --> 00:58:45,358
These hauntings can be
terrifying things.

538
00:58:46,735 --> 00:58:49,487
Maybe the fear of the beyond...

539
00:58:49,654 --> 00:58:53,033
...overcame the fear of getting caught.

540
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:55,326
Or maybe he wanted to get caught.

541
00:58:59,956 --> 00:59:01,541
What? What is it?

542
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:04,502
I'm sorry.

543
00:59:04,669 --> 00:59:07,380
I'm seeing things.

544
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:10,091
The shock of the whole thing, I suppose.

545
00:59:10,258 --> 00:59:12,302
Do you need me for anything else?

546
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:13,803
No.

547
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:15,472
Thank you.

548
00:59:24,647 --> 00:59:26,274
Melissa?

549
00:59:27,692 --> 00:59:28,985
Dad?

550
00:59:29,152 --> 00:59:32,155
Down here, honey. I found the whistle.

551
00:59:55,553 --> 00:59:56,930
Dad?

552
01:02:24,369 --> 01:02:26,913
- What are you doing here?
- You can't find her, can you?

553
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,749
What happened to her? Where is she?

554
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:32,002
- We've looked everywhere.
- Not everywhere.

555
01:02:49,352 --> 01:02:51,396
Oh, God, no.

556
01:02:55,108 --> 01:02:57,027
Imogen, call an ambulance.

557
01:02:57,193 --> 01:02:58,695
Now!

558
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:16,129
How did you know where she was?

559
01:03:17,422 --> 01:03:18,882
What happened to her?

560
01:03:19,257 --> 01:03:22,302
There's something evil in that house...

561
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:24,304
...and I let it into this world.

562
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:26,723
I think it made Ted Garza do
what he did...

563
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:29,851
...and it's taken your sister's spirit,
and I'm gonna find it...

564
01:03:30,018 --> 01:03:31,895
...and I'm gonna finish it tonight.

565
01:03:34,522 --> 01:03:35,982
I can see things too.

566
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:50,246
When I was a little girl...

567
01:03:50,747 --> 01:03:53,541
...I went to sleep
and floated out of my bedroom...

568
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,503
...all the way
to our elderly neighbour's house.

569
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:00,715
Then she told me she was leaving
this world and going on to the next.

570
01:04:00,882 --> 01:04:04,344
My dad told me
she had died the night before.

571
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:06,971
I told him I already knew.

572
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:11,768
- He wasn't too happy to hear that.
- Imogen, let's go.

573
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:13,144
Come on, honey.

574
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:16,022
No, I... I'm staying.

575
01:04:16,481 --> 01:04:19,150
Just trust me, okay?

576
01:04:21,569 --> 01:04:25,448
Come on, boys, let's get our things
and get in the house and get started.

577
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:29,035
Son of a...

578
01:04:31,287 --> 01:04:35,250
I am going to get the attention
of all the spirits in this house.

579
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:37,502
I need things
that were important to Garza.

580
01:04:37,669 --> 01:04:39,671
Specs, go upstairs.

581
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:42,298
There is a Bible he held
very dear to him.

582
01:04:42,465 --> 01:04:46,428
It was a red King James version,
and I need you to find it.

583
01:04:46,594 --> 01:04:48,471
- Take Imogen with you.
- Okay.

584
01:04:48,638 --> 01:04:50,724
- Do not let her out of your sight.
- I won't.

585
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:53,727
Tucker and I are going down
to the fallout shelter.

586
01:04:53,893 --> 01:04:57,105
I get the death chamber,
he gets Bible camp with a beautiful girl?

587
01:04:57,272 --> 01:04:58,398
That's not a democracy.

588
01:04:58,565 --> 01:05:01,693
You're the only one
I trust to go down there with me.

589
01:05:02,527 --> 01:05:04,821
Don't patronise me, woman.

590
01:05:05,822 --> 01:05:08,742
So why do you guys dress like that?

591
01:05:10,785 --> 01:05:13,621
It was Elise's idea. She dressed us.

592
01:05:14,914 --> 01:05:18,543
No, my usual style's a lot more
laid back.

593
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:20,211
It's a little...

594
01:05:21,129 --> 01:05:22,839
- What?
- Dude.

595
01:05:26,718 --> 01:05:28,845
This is vintage. No, this is worth a lot.

596
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:31,765
I'm serious. We gotta find this thing.

597
01:05:31,931 --> 01:05:33,266
I'm just saying.

598
01:05:33,433 --> 01:05:35,143
- Gotta have hobbies.
- I'm saying.

599
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:39,314
Can't all be work. Gotta enjoy yourself,
go out on a date.

600
01:05:42,192 --> 01:05:44,361
You gotta do stuff like that.

601
01:05:44,527 --> 01:05:46,029
There's something here.

602
01:05:47,572 --> 01:05:49,574
I can feel it.

603
01:05:53,078 --> 01:05:54,954
She wants me to have it.

604
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:59,125
Oh, that should do it.

605
01:05:59,292 --> 01:06:01,461
- Step aside.
- Yes, sir.

606
01:06:45,755 --> 01:06:47,799
It's time to sleep.

607
01:07:00,437 --> 01:07:02,689
I know this slip.

608
01:07:02,856 --> 01:07:05,525
- This will help you sleep.
- Don't make me drink anymore.

609
01:07:05,692 --> 01:07:08,153
Please, let me go. I beg you.

610
01:07:08,903 --> 01:07:10,071
There you go.

611
01:07:11,656 --> 01:07:13,700
Please, let me go.

612
01:07:13,867 --> 01:07:16,453
I promise I won't tell.

613
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:18,830
Please, let me...

614
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:52,405
Did you hear that?

615
01:07:52,572 --> 01:07:54,491
Hear what?

616
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:02,082
- My brother doesn't believe you're here.
- Christian!

617
01:08:04,918 --> 01:08:06,628
There's someone in the laundry.

618
01:08:18,056 --> 01:08:20,141
There's no one here.

619
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:23,895
You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it.

620
01:08:42,747 --> 01:08:43,790
Goodbye, Anna.

621
01:08:52,674 --> 01:08:54,843
She wasn't dead.

622
01:08:57,512 --> 01:09:00,765
My father did the exact same thing
that Garza did.

623
01:09:01,599 --> 01:09:04,602
The woman I saw in this house
all those years ago...

624
01:09:05,437 --> 01:09:07,564
...she was alive.

625
01:09:11,151 --> 01:09:13,278
I could have helped her.

626
01:09:15,113 --> 01:09:16,948
I let him kill her.

627
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:22,555
Take this thing off.

628
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:24,891
Okay.

629
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:52,293
Her death was my fault.

630
01:10:54,254 --> 01:10:57,465
Until I free her from wherever
he put her...

631
01:10:58,174 --> 01:11:00,468
...she's trapped in the dark.

632
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:03,263
Lost.

633
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:05,473
I'm going in there.

634
01:11:06,641 --> 01:11:08,018
Stand back.

635
01:11:13,857 --> 01:11:15,692
Go for it.

636
01:11:15,859 --> 01:11:17,485
I'm good.

637
01:12:08,953 --> 01:12:10,789
I'm sorry, Anna.

638
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,502
I failed you.

639
01:13:03,174 --> 01:13:05,844
Oh, my God.

640
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:14,185
Where you going?

641
01:13:14,686 --> 01:13:16,021
Elise.

642
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:18,356
Elise.

643
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,462
Elise.

644
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:46,092
You weren't the only one, Anna.

645
01:15:10,468 --> 01:15:12,429
- Audrey!
- Elise?

646
01:15:14,723 --> 01:15:16,391
<i>Audrey.</i>

647
01:15:18,184 --> 01:15:19,394
<i>Audrey.</i>

648
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:21,146
Elise.

649
01:15:21,855 --> 01:15:23,648
Where am I?

650
01:15:24,149 --> 01:15:26,735
You're in a special place...

651
01:15:27,444 --> 01:15:29,279
...where the spirits go.

652
01:15:29,446 --> 01:15:31,281
Who are you?

653
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,244
I'm... A friend.

654
01:15:37,412 --> 01:15:38,955
I don't wanna be here.

655
01:15:39,122 --> 01:15:41,082
I don't wanna go where the spirits go.

656
01:15:46,504 --> 01:15:47,589
Elise...

657
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,426
...no matter what your daddy says...

658
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:54,929
...you have to go on doing what you do.

659
01:15:55,597 --> 01:15:59,184
Never be afraid of your ability.

660
01:16:04,064 --> 01:16:07,108
Daddy doesn't mean it
when he yells at me.

661
01:16:08,109 --> 01:16:09,235
He's scared...

662
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:12,989
...of the man with the keys.

663
01:16:13,156 --> 01:16:15,825
He's the one controlling it all.

664
01:16:15,992 --> 01:16:18,745
He's the one who opens all the doors.

665
01:16:22,248 --> 01:16:26,294
- He opens all the red doors?
- Yes.

666
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:29,506
The man with the keys said
I'm more powerful than I know.

667
01:16:29,673 --> 01:16:32,217
He says he wants me
to help him open every door.

668
01:16:32,384 --> 01:16:34,886
He says he'll do anything it takes
to get me.

669
01:16:37,555 --> 01:16:39,391
He's standing right behind you.

670
01:16:41,184 --> 01:16:42,435
<i>No!</i>

671
01:16:42,602 --> 01:16:45,397
Leave this place!

672
01:16:51,569 --> 01:16:54,364
Elise, wake up.

673
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:56,908
Elise!

674
01:16:58,702 --> 01:17:00,495
Specs!

675
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:02,372
I need help!

676
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:06,209
Here, here. Careful with her head.

677
01:17:08,044 --> 01:17:09,963
- She's on the other side.
- Somebody has to go in.

678
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,966
Yeah, who's gonna do that?
I can't do that. Can you do that?

679
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:14,509
- I didn't say...
- I can do it.

680
01:17:17,637 --> 01:17:18,888
I can help her.

681
01:17:19,055 --> 01:17:22,642
I've never actually hypnotised
anybody before.

682
01:17:22,809 --> 01:17:24,602
I've never been hypnotised.

683
01:17:24,769 --> 01:17:27,272
Well, then you won't know
what I'm doing wrong, right?

684
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:34,696
Okay.

685
01:17:35,613 --> 01:17:39,409
The exercise, it's a little...
I'm gonna... I'll put my finger there.

686
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:40,994
E. T.

687
01:17:42,412 --> 01:17:44,039
Imogen.

688
01:17:44,205 --> 01:17:45,498
That's pretty cool.

689
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:47,876
Just look here.

690
01:17:48,668 --> 01:17:51,046
And concentrate on it and just relax.

691
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:55,800
Imagine that your body is made of water
and you're in the ocean.

692
01:17:55,967 --> 01:17:57,635
That doesn't make sense.

693
01:17:58,345 --> 01:18:00,138
- What?
- She's made of water...

694
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:03,600
...and she's in the ocean.
Therefore, she is the ocean.

695
01:18:04,142 --> 01:18:06,102
Would you like to do this?

696
01:18:10,857 --> 01:18:13,443
- Thank you.
- I'll still be here.

697
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:15,695
- Don't touch the subject.
- I'm not.

698
01:18:15,862 --> 01:18:17,572
Move away.

699
01:18:34,964 --> 01:18:36,299
Close your eyes.

700
01:18:37,342 --> 01:18:40,261
Listen to the ticking.

701
01:18:40,428 --> 01:18:42,347
Focus on it.

702
01:18:42,847 --> 01:18:45,475
I'm going to count back from five.

703
01:18:45,892 --> 01:18:50,730
By the time I reach one,
you will be hypnotised.

704
01:18:51,272 --> 01:18:53,817
Five, four...

705
01:18:54,818 --> 01:18:59,406
...three, two, one.

706
01:18:59,572 --> 01:19:02,158
Nod if you can hear me.

707
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:10,375
When I say "now,"
you will open your eyes...

708
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:14,254
...and you will be on the other side.

709
01:19:17,966 --> 01:19:19,801
<i>Now.</i>

710
01:19:42,657 --> 01:19:45,118
Wanna go there.

711
01:20:06,973 --> 01:20:08,683
I'll help you.

712
01:20:51,685 --> 01:20:53,687
Red door.

713
01:20:54,979 --> 01:20:56,356
Red door.

714
01:20:56,523 --> 01:20:59,109
That's the red door
Elise was talking about.

715
01:21:00,026 --> 01:21:02,404
This is the place.

716
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:31,433
I can't go in there.

717
01:21:31,599 --> 01:21:33,852
If he finds me, he'll...

718
01:21:34,519 --> 01:21:36,688
He'll take me again.

719
01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:40,066
Trust me. You'll find
what you're looking for in there.

720
01:21:43,611 --> 01:21:45,030
<i>I admit it!</i>

721
01:21:45,196 --> 01:21:46,781
<i>Shut up!</i>

722
01:21:48,074 --> 01:21:49,826
<i>That's right!</i>

723
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:52,495
Elise?

724
01:21:54,539 --> 01:21:56,833
<i>The key is missing.</i>

725
01:21:57,584 --> 01:22:00,879
<i>You're all gonna get it again!</i>

726
01:22:20,565 --> 01:22:23,818
<i>Do you ever think about the people
who go to the electric chair?</i>

727
01:22:24,903 --> 01:22:26,237
<i>Sometimes.</i>

728
01:22:26,404 --> 01:22:28,990
<i>Do you wonder where they go?</i>

729
01:22:33,745 --> 01:22:35,872
<i>Your turn now.</i>

730
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:10,573
<i>Look out!</i>

731
01:23:46,317 --> 01:23:50,155
<i>- -always repeats, my friends.
The ghosts of their past...</i>

732
01:23:53,158 --> 01:23:55,785
<i>...if we do not confront them head-on.</i>

733
01:24:13,345 --> 01:24:17,974
<i>If there's one thing you've been doing
your whole life, Elise, it's ask for it.</i>

734
01:24:18,141 --> 01:24:21,019
No! No, Daddy!

735
01:24:21,186 --> 01:24:24,022
<i>They're all around us in this house.</i>

736
01:24:24,189 --> 01:24:25,523
<i>Everywhere.</i>

737
01:24:28,735 --> 01:24:31,905
<i>She needs to learn nobody else
can possibly love someone like her.</i>

738
01:24:32,072 --> 01:24:34,366
Stop, Daddy, stop.

739
01:24:35,408 --> 01:24:38,244
<i>- No, Daddy, please.
- Please, stop. No.</i>

740
01:24:38,411 --> 01:24:40,080
<i>- Stop.
- No. No.</i>

741
01:24:40,246 --> 01:24:42,332
<i>No, Daddy!</i>

742
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:44,751
<i>Some people are afraid
of special people.</i>

743
01:24:44,918 --> 01:24:47,170
<i>Your daddy is one of them.</i>

744
01:24:51,007 --> 01:24:53,510
<i>I won't let you hurt me anymore.</i>

745
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,232
<i>Did you see a ghost?</i>

746
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:09,651
<i>Just say no. That's all you have to do.</i>

747
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:13,238
<i>You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it. I never asked for it.</i>

748
01:25:16,116 --> 01:25:17,534
You killed your mother.

749
01:25:32,507 --> 01:25:33,925
Elise.

750
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:37,679
Elise!

751
01:25:41,683 --> 01:25:43,393
Elise!

752
01:25:45,061 --> 01:25:47,856
<i>He's in my head. He's in my head.</i>

753
01:25:48,231 --> 01:25:50,942
<i>My father did the exact same thing
as Garza.</i>

754
01:25:52,819 --> 01:25:56,823
My father was your puppet.

755
01:25:57,949 --> 01:26:02,454
I am not gonna feed you
with hatred anymore, demon.

756
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:03,955
You can fucking starve.

757
01:26:06,374 --> 01:26:07,625
Elise!

758
01:26:08,126 --> 01:26:09,502
No!

759
01:26:13,631 --> 01:26:17,552
Leave her alone!
You wanna take somebody, take me.

760
01:26:38,281 --> 01:26:39,866
Let them go.

761
01:26:42,077 --> 01:26:43,244
<i>See now?</i>

762
01:26:54,255 --> 01:26:55,924
Honey? Honey?

763
01:26:56,091 --> 01:26:58,385
Nurse! Nurse, get in here!

764
01:26:59,594 --> 01:27:01,179
Melissa!

765
01:27:12,065 --> 01:27:13,817
One, two, three, four.

766
01:27:24,994 --> 01:27:26,788
I'm sorry.

767
01:27:33,044 --> 01:27:34,170
No! No!

768
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:36,923
No!

769
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:40,135
No!

770
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:01,531
Elise!

771
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,417
Hands off my little girl.

772
01:29:30,995 --> 01:29:32,789
No, no, no.

773
01:29:32,956 --> 01:29:34,708
Elise!

774
01:29:34,874 --> 01:29:36,626
She's hurt.

775
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:19,252
Return to your body. Go.

776
01:30:27,344 --> 01:30:28,803
Baby.

777
01:30:29,471 --> 01:30:31,097
Oh, Dad.

778
01:30:31,264 --> 01:30:33,683
Elise, she saved me.

779
01:30:57,457 --> 01:30:59,250
I don't know the words.

780
01:31:03,546 --> 01:31:05,882
I already know, my love.

781
01:31:12,931 --> 01:31:14,599
Keep helping people.

782
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:35,912
Go home.

783
01:31:45,505 --> 01:31:47,716
Imogen, wake up!

784
01:31:48,842 --> 01:31:50,051
Are you okay?

785
01:31:50,218 --> 01:31:51,469
Yeah, I think so.

786
01:31:54,264 --> 01:31:57,517
You can't get rid of me that easy.
The hospital.

787
01:32:01,521 --> 01:32:04,065
<i>Nurse needed in ICU stat.</i>

788
01:32:04,232 --> 01:32:06,901
<i>Nurse needed in ICU stat.</i>

789
01:32:09,487 --> 01:32:11,114
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey.

790
01:32:11,281 --> 01:32:12,407
Hi.

791
01:32:12,574 --> 01:32:14,117
I'm okay.

792
01:32:14,284 --> 01:32:16,578
Oh, my God.

793
01:32:17,037 --> 01:32:18,538
Hi.

794
01:32:34,137 --> 01:32:35,847
I believe this is yours.

795
01:32:42,437 --> 01:32:44,064
You were right, Christian.

796
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:45,774
I'm cursed.

797
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:48,693
Demons follow me around.

798
01:32:49,819 --> 01:32:54,908
But I don't want to give them
what they want for one second longer.

799
01:32:55,075 --> 01:32:58,119
Fear and pain is what feeds them.

800
01:32:59,371 --> 01:33:01,956
I'm the one that's been feeding them...

801
01:33:02,123 --> 01:33:04,626
...shutting you out all these years.

802
01:33:05,502 --> 01:33:07,128
You forgive me?

803
01:33:07,295 --> 01:33:09,422
I never should have left you.

804
01:33:16,971 --> 01:33:18,682
Thank you.

805
01:33:19,391 --> 01:33:20,975
Yes.

806
01:33:28,608 --> 01:33:30,276
Melissa...

807
01:33:30,443 --> 01:33:32,278
...you gonna eat that?

808
01:33:33,697 --> 01:33:35,156
Go for it.

809
01:33:38,827 --> 01:33:43,248
You know, I always thought
that I was afraid of dying...

810
01:33:44,290 --> 01:33:47,085
...but now I realise that I wasn't.

811
01:33:47,877 --> 01:33:49,963
I was afraid of dying...

812
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:53,383
...before I truly had a family again.

813
01:33:55,135 --> 01:33:56,845
Now I do.

814
01:33:57,303 --> 01:33:58,972
Son of a...

815
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:01,141
I told you not to park there.

816
01:34:01,307 --> 01:34:04,144
- Just saying, I did.
- Listen to your buddy.

817
01:34:04,978 --> 01:34:07,480
He gets the girl, I get the ticket?

818
01:34:08,815 --> 01:34:10,275
I'm riding shotgun.

819
01:34:10,442 --> 01:34:13,319
We'll have to come back here
to deal with that ticket.

820
01:34:57,822 --> 01:34:59,491
Dalton.

821
01:35:00,158 --> 01:35:03,244
Today was just so horrible.
I'm scared nothing's gonna change.

822
01:35:03,411 --> 01:35:04,746
It will.

823
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:07,040
I promise you.

824
01:35:07,499 --> 01:35:09,626
<i>Just gotta give it time.</i>

825
01:35:30,146 --> 01:35:32,315
Oh, Dalton.

826
01:35:46,788 --> 01:35:47,831
Hello.

827
01:35:47,997 --> 01:35:51,668
<i>I'm so sorry for calling so late.
My name is Lorraine.</i>

828
01:35:51,835 --> 01:35:56,006
<i>You helped my family a long time ago
when my son was just a boy.</i>

829
01:35:56,172 --> 01:35:59,092
<i>And now the same thing is happening
to my grandson.</i>

830
01:35:59,259 --> 01:36:00,844
Dalton.

831
01:36:01,261 --> 01:36:02,637
<i>How did you know his name?</i>

832
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,682
It's what I do.

833
01:36:07,684 --> 01:36:09,978
Tell Josh I'll be there in the morning.

834
01:36:10,145 --> 01:36:11,896
<i>Thank you.</i>

835
01:36:12,063 --> 01:36:14,816
<i>- Good night.
- Good night.</i>
