1
00:00:57,428 --> 00:01:01,219
<i>Look at the sonar.
Let me know what you find.</i>

2
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:05,194
<i>So far nothing new, my friend.
It just keeps getting worse.</i>

3
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:30,268
D'Angelo, Marks, talk to me.

4
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:35,190
We've moved to the sonar room.
Just nine rescues so far.

5
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,395
<i>It's a mess, man.
This is the worst I've ever seen.</i>

6
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:42,097
Help!

7
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,096
Help!

8
00:01:44,176 --> 00:01:46,031
Somebody help me!

9
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:49,168
Help! Who's there?

10
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:57,474
I got one more survivor.
Heading back to the rescue vehicle now.

11
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:02,047
Marks. D'Angelo. What the hell was that?

12
00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:04,015
I have no idea.

13
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:06,255
Listen.

14
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,764
<i>Jonas, that's something outside the ship.</i>

15
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:20,470
<i>There's something out there.</i>

16
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:29,762
Here.

17
00:02:30,456 --> 00:02:32,282
You okay, pal?

18
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:38,184
Oh, my God.

19
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:42,154
Something's crushing the hull.
Get back to the rescue vehicle. Now.

20
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:44,259
We're right behind you.

21
00:02:46,703 --> 00:02:47,942
You guys, move!

22
00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:49,551
Slide him up.

23
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:53,598
Marks. D'Angelo. Report. You almost here?

24
00:02:53,678 --> 00:02:56,067
<i>Jonas, listen to me. We're trapped!</i>

25
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:58,604
- What?
- The impact jammed the hatch!

26
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:00,420
Coming back.

27
00:03:02,461 --> 00:03:04,242
- <i>The sub is starting to collapse.</i>
- Marks!

28
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:07,811
Jonas, we need you
down here before it's too late.

29
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,351
The sub's been breached.
There's water everywhere.

30
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:13,985
<i>Jonas, the room is flooding.</i>

31
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:16,588
<i>Marks, we gotta get this hatch open.</i>

32
00:03:16,668 --> 00:03:19,460
<i>Come on, Jonas. Where are you?
It's not gonna work!</i>

33
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,159
<i>Jonas, hurry, please!</i>

34
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,329
<i>We just need more time! Don't leave us!</i>

35
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:24,471
<i>Jonas!</i>

36
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:28,466
<i>Let us know when you're here! Don't give up!</i>

37
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:31,042
- <i>Jonas, please!</i>
- <i>Come down here, now! Where are you?</i>

38
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:32,467
<i>Jonas!</i>

39
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:41,612
You've lost your mind!

40
00:03:41,692 --> 00:03:45,064
Back off, Heller.
If we go back, everyone dies.

41
00:03:45,144 --> 00:03:46,467
Everyone.

42
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,961
What have you done?

43
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:36,527
Are we living the dream here or what?

44
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:39,564
Welcome to <i>Mana One,</i> Mr. Morris.

45
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:42,833
Get that thing away from me.
What are you doing?

46
00:05:42,913 --> 00:05:45,972
Come on, bring it in. There we go.

47
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:49,174
Good to see you again, Mr. Morris.
This way, please.

48
00:05:49,254 --> 00:05:52,297
Hey, you always smell so nice.
What is that? Sandalwood?

49
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:54,845
It's impressive so far, I'll say.

50
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:57,815
Oh, here they are.
Do you remember my daughter Suyin?

51
00:05:57,895 --> 00:06:00,302
- Our chief marine biologist.
- Hi.

52
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:13,553
Sorry, what was that? I didn't catch it.

53
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:15,295
Uh...

54
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:18,243
She says she likes your hat.

55
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:21,383
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

56
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:26,886
- Let's go.
- Why don't we go? Yeah.

57
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:32,399
Your granddaughter's a pistol.

58
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:34,181
Okay.

59
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:36,551
What have we here?

60
00:06:38,137 --> 00:06:39,958
This is, um...

61
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:43,127
...really ugly.

62
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:46,306
I realize that we're under construction
and everything but I really think...

63
00:06:46,386 --> 00:06:51,702
...that a world-class research institute
deserves a world-class entrance.

64
00:06:51,782 --> 00:06:54,260
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

65
00:06:55,554 --> 00:06:57,578
<i>O-Level.</i>

66
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:01,313
Whoa!

67
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:03,315
Welcome to the O-Level.

68
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:05,877
Nice.

69
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:08,982
This is our central hub,
from which researchers...

70
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:12,606
...will access all five labs
once it's finished.

71
00:07:14,273 --> 00:07:15,790
Wow!

72
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:19,494
Oh, look at that.

73
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:23,774
That's not something you see every day.

74
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,865
Did you have those whales here on cue?

75
00:07:31,156 --> 00:07:34,012
I might have lured them
with some whale songs.

76
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:38,683
This is Lucy and her daughter Gracie.

77
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,802
Incredible.

78
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:45,640
Wow!

79
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,992
- <i>Dive control level.</i>
- Here we are.

80
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:50,610
Follow me quickly. I hope we are on time.

81
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,435
Come on in.

82
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,234
Oh. Oh, man.

83
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:59,871
I'd like you to meet our engineer
and sub designer, Jaxx.

84
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:01,287
- Hey, Doc.
- Hello.

85
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:02,907
Hi.

86
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:05,510
Doctor Heller. Our medical officer.

87
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,680
Nice to meet you. You're like Bones, huh?

88
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,263
DJ here pilots our remote explorer.

89
00:08:11,343 --> 00:08:14,720
- How's it going?
- You're my first billionaire.

90
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,290
- And of course, Mac, our station chief.
- Mr. Morris, just in time.

91
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,818
- So I keep hearing.
- Try that.

92
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:24,403
- Just in time for what?
- <i>Good morning, Mr. Morris.</i>

93
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,715
Lori Taylor, our mission pilot.

94
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:29,200
Hi, Mr. Morris. Welcome on board.
It's good to have you.

95
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,638
Hey. How's it going down there?
Where'd you learn how to pilot a sub?

96
00:08:33,718 --> 00:08:36,976
<i>I spent ten years with a certain
whale-saving environmental group...</i>

97
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:39,611
...that shall remain unnamed
for legal reasons.

98
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:43,048
Yeah, ask her if she ever blew up
a whaling ship with a homemade torpedo.

99
00:08:43,128 --> 00:08:44,829
- Hey.
- No.

100
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:48,986
That is a good hire.

101
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:50,289
<i>Eleven in two.</i>

102
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:53,859
<i>Water temperature is at six degrees.</i>

103
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,497
Mac, we are through the thermocline.
We are approaching 11,000 meters.

104
00:08:58,577 --> 00:09:00,821
One hundred meters from the bottom.

105
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:03,200
<i>Maybe.</i>

106
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,102
<i>Maybe from the bottom.</i>

107
00:09:05,182 --> 00:09:07,938
"Maybe"? What does he mean, "maybe"?

108
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:09,874
Come on. Look at this.

109
00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:12,701
Since 1875, we've all believed...

110
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:15,867
...the Mariana Trench
was the deepest place on Earth.

111
00:09:15,947 --> 00:09:18,250
I've had a theory that
what we think is the bottom...

112
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,285
...might actually be a layer
of hydrogen sulfide.

113
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:24,523
Beneath that cloud,
and a freezing cold thermocline...

114
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:26,860
...there could be a completely new world.

115
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,780
The <i>Origin</i> is about to see
if my father is right.

116
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,526
If there is warm water below, that means
we're going to be the first to see it.

117
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:36,133
And what if you're wrong?

118
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:39,505
Then you have wasted $1.3 billion.

119
00:09:42,353 --> 00:09:44,171
You're kidding.

120
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,880
- He's kidding, right?
- Copy that.

121
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,914
Wait. What?

122
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:52,444
Ten meters. Approaching boundary.

123
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:59,990
Hovering at five meters. Full stop.

124
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,607
- Final checks. Jaxx?
- Good to go.

125
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:03,928
- Doc?
- Crew are go.

126
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:06,164
- DJ?
- Sub and rover are a go.

127
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:08,981
<i>Origin</i> crew, we are go for insertion.

128
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:10,803
Insertion.

129
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:15,570
- Is everything sexual with you guys?
- Sex, food, power and...

130
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,180
- Money.
- Blow it up now.

131
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:23,834
Dive control, we are a go for... insertion.

132
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:40,533
We're in. You guys, we're in.

133
00:10:41,113 --> 00:10:43,294
<i>It's a cloud. It is not the bottom.</i>

134
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:46,138
Lori, be careful. We don't know
the depth on the other side of this.

135
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:50,505
- <i>The sea floor could come right up on you.</i>
- <i>Copy that, Mac. We're ready.</i>

136
00:11:00,297 --> 00:11:01,920
You guys, we are through!

137
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,423
<i>I have multiple small sonar contacts.</i>

138
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:06,858
<i>There is life down here.</i>

139
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:08,488
<i>Congratulations!</i>

140
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:10,991
Deploying the lights.

141
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:31,606
Lights deployed. I'm gonna come around.

142
00:11:46,311 --> 00:11:48,000
Whoa!

143
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,285
Oh, my goodness.

144
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:12,191
- Wow!
- Whoa!

145
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:13,800
Mac, tell me you're getting this.

146
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,752
We're getting all of it, Lori.
Got a lot of smiling faces up here.

147
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:26,036
DJ, we got positive terrain
to launch the rover.

148
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:27,326
Copy.

149
00:12:27,406 --> 00:12:30,007
Launch is all yours.

150
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:31,605
Okay.

151
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:34,541
Rover is...

152
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,377
...free.

153
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:39,637
Copy.

154
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:48,005
<i>Water temperature
below three degrees Celsius.</i>

155
00:12:55,347 --> 00:12:58,232
How is this possible?

156
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,941
This ecosystem is completely cut off
from the rest of the ocean...

157
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:05,343
...by the freezing cold thermocline.

158
00:13:05,423 --> 00:13:09,548
We should find all sorts of species
completely unknown to science.

159
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:12,424
Sounds like a good investment.

160
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:20,724
Lori, I have a contact.
Bearing zero eight zero.

161
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:25,730
- It's big.
- Oh, it's huge.

162
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,650
And it's moving fast.

163
00:13:29,898 --> 00:13:31,766
DJ, is the rover seeing this?

164
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:36,757
Negative. Let me try
and bring up some more lights.

165
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:44,982
Rover One, <i>signal interrupted.</i>

166
00:13:45,062 --> 00:13:47,484
Whoa! I just lost telemetry.

167
00:13:47,564 --> 00:13:49,382
What the hell?

168
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:56,087
<i>Origin,</i> recommend an immediate right turn to
three-five-zero. This could be a landslide.

169
00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:08,206
Last time I checked, landslides
don't make 90-degree turns.

170
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:10,704
It's right on us! It's right on us!

171
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:16,194
What the hell was that?

172
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:20,618
- Lori, what's going on down there?
- You guys...

173
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:22,328
- What?
- ...come look at this.

174
00:14:24,903 --> 00:14:27,992
Whoa! What could do that to the rover?

175
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:29,840
I don't think I wanna know.

176
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,627
It's coming back.

177
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:39,404
- Oh, my God!
- <i>Let's get out of here. Blow the tanks.</i>

178
00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:41,740
<i>I'm trying. It's not working! Mac, help!</i>

179
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,885
- Whole system's down!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. DJ, Mac...

180
00:14:44,965 --> 00:14:48,240
<i>...there's something down here.
Jonas was right. Jonas was right!</i>

181
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,177
<i>Do you co...</i>

182
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:54,554
Lori, come in.

183
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:56,723
<i>Origin,</i> can you hear me?

184
00:14:56,885 --> 00:14:59,218
<i>Origin,</i> please respond.

185
00:15:00,038 --> 00:15:02,256
- Come on.
- Lori, come in.

186
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:06,894
Wall, can you hear me?

187
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:10,665
Toshi?

188
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:16,475
Gather around, people. Options.

189
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:19,544
- Not great.
- We know they're alive.

190
00:15:19,624 --> 00:15:22,113
I've still got telemetry on their vitals.

191
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:25,151
- How long do they have?
- Maybe 18 hours.

192
00:15:25,231 --> 00:15:27,852
Ballast valves are jammed,
which means it can't rise by itself.

193
00:15:27,932 --> 00:15:31,722
If we attempt to tow it, it's fifty-fifty
that the tanks will explode...

194
00:15:31,802 --> 00:15:32,897
...and breach the capsule.

195
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:35,026
- Can't we go hatch-to-hatch?
- Not a chance.

196
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:37,429
The external camera's showing
severe hatch damage.

197
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:39,798
- We have to try something.
- They're six miles down...

198
00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:42,767
...and no one has ever attempted
a rescue at that depth.

199
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,931
That's not exactly true.

200
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,879
- No. No way.
- We can handle this.

201
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,313
- Not at 11,000 meters, you can't.
- We've gone 5,000 meters.

202
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:55,490
8,000 meters. At some point,
it just becomes a number.

203
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,093
Why don't you try this number? Three.

204
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:01,820
That's how many people have actually
attempted a rescue below 10,000 meters.

205
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,722
And the number one.

206
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:06,691
That's how many are left alive to talk
about it. One man. Jonas Taylor.

207
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:09,561
And look what happened to that one man
the last time he went to these depths.

208
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:12,464
He saved eleven people, including you,
Heller. That's what happened.

209
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:16,401
He left our friends to die, because
he had pressure-induced psychosis.

210
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:20,572
Come on, Heller. That was your diagnosis.
Jonas said something attacked them.

211
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:23,021
Something big enough to take out
a nuclear submarine.

212
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:25,812
He's a drunk. He washed up
on a beach in Thailand.

213
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:29,416
- Did you hear what Lori said? Were you there?
- That's enough.

214
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:34,653
We all heard Lori's last transmission.

215
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:38,313
We have to consider that <i>Origin</i> may have
encountered something similar...

216
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:42,514
...to what Jonas Taylor described.
Something he was able to escape from.

217
00:16:42,594 --> 00:16:45,197
<i>Ba!</i> Please.

218
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:49,567
Prep the helicopter. We must go to Thailand.

219
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,940
Your boat, she's killing me.

220
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,172
Number one engine slips out of the gear...

221
00:17:31,252 --> 00:17:34,213
- ...and there's some leak in the hydraulics.
- Hey, I'll take a look at it tonight.

222
00:17:34,293 --> 00:17:36,620
That's what you said last night
and the night before that...

223
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,550
...and the night before that.

224
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,486
- Hey, I'm working up to it.
- You drink too much.

225
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:45,894
Hey, now you're only saying that because
I literally have a beer in my hand.

226
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:48,726
You always have beer in your hand.

227
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:50,557
You know why?

228
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,470
Because I drink too much?

229
00:18:15,501 --> 00:18:19,140
Now this is shaping up to be
an eventful Tuesday evening.

230
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,293
You know I like to make an entrance.

231
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:24,362
Hell, Mac, after five years,
just showing up is making an entrance.

232
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:26,731
What? You're living above a bar? Really?

233
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:29,629
Figured it was the only way
to get you to come visit.

234
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,757
- Jonas, allow me to introduce...
- It's an honor to meet you, Doctor Zhang.

235
00:18:35,837 --> 00:18:38,543
Always had a tremendous
respect for your work.

236
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:41,946
- You're too kind, Mr. Taylor.
- Yeah, no, I'm not. You're a good man.

237
00:18:42,026 --> 00:18:44,582
Hey, can I offer either of you two a beer?

238
00:18:44,662 --> 00:18:46,545
'Cause I'm gonna have a beer.

239
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:48,920
It's not a social call, Jonas.

240
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,456
You mean you didn't helicopter in
just to say "hi"?

241
00:18:52,536 --> 00:18:55,059
You wound me, Mac.

242
00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:57,562
- We have a serious...
- Problem?

243
00:18:57,642 --> 00:19:01,075
Thought so. Just like you know...

244
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:04,436
...I don't dive anymore.
Done being responsible for people...

245
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:07,739
- Mr. Taylor...
- Hey, I mean no offense, Doctor Zhang.

246
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:11,409
If there was two people on this planet
that could get me back into the water...

247
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:14,702
...it's probably you two. But you can't.

248
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:18,050
You're gonna tell me your problem,
and I'll say no.

249
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,253
You're gonna offer me money.
I'll still say no.

250
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:25,291
You're gonna appeal to my better
nature, and I'm gonna say no.

251
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:27,393
Because I don't have one.

252
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:30,461
So I say, why don't we sit down?

253
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,732
We'll enjoy a couple of beers,
and then we can get you on your way.

254
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:36,657
Jonas.

255
00:19:37,615 --> 00:19:39,917
This happened this morning.

256
00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:42,874
<i>Let's get out of here. Blow the tanks!</i>

257
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:47,762
<i>I'm trying. It's not working!
Mac, help! Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

258
00:19:47,842 --> 00:19:51,511
<i>DJ, Mac, there's something
down here. Jonas was right.</i>

259
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,053
<i>Jonas was right! Do you co...</i>

260
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:55,787
It's Lori.

261
00:19:55,867 --> 00:20:00,558
Your ex-wife and her crew
are trapped below 11,000 meters.

262
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:04,163
I fear they may have encountered
the same species you did down there.

263
00:20:04,643 --> 00:20:07,899
I have divers
with less experience willing to go.

264
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:13,201
But I feel I owe it to my crew to give
this rescue the best chance of success.

265
00:20:15,753 --> 00:20:17,105
Please.

266
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:28,215
Lori, hand me that hexa key.

267
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:30,917
Thanks.

268
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,626
Oh.

269
00:20:35,706 --> 00:20:39,298
Okay. Okay, if we can
short out the firewall...

270
00:20:39,378 --> 00:20:42,428
...I can... I can probably
reboot the computers.

271
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,253
Okay. Try it now.

272
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:53,339
Auxiliary power's back.

273
00:20:56,961 --> 00:21:00,219
Heaters are online. There's no way
that we'll get the engine started...

274
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,052
...but we might be able
to get the ballast tanks back.

275
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:08,043
- What are you doing? Taking notes?
- Letter to my wife.

276
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,493
Just in case.

277
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:16,435
Hey. We got this.

278
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:18,303
Step by step.

279
00:21:18,773 --> 00:21:21,176
Come on. Give me that fighting octopus.

280
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:34,809
See? Works every time.

281
00:21:41,873 --> 00:21:43,595
No.

282
00:21:43,675 --> 00:21:46,496
- What?
- We gotta can the lights.

283
00:22:06,097 --> 00:22:07,987
Turn out the lights.

284
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,088
<i>There was something down there with us.</i>

285
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:13,292
<i>How can you be sure if there were
no observation windows on your craft?</i>

286
00:22:13,372 --> 00:22:17,697
<i>'Cause whatever it was caved in the entire
starboard side of a nuclear submarine.</i>

287
00:22:18,577 --> 00:22:19,697
<i>That wasn't my imagination.</i>

288
00:22:19,777 --> 00:22:22,367
<i>Is that why you blew the hatch mid-rescue?</i>

289
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:25,736
<i>Hey, look, I brought
11 men back safe and sound.</i>

290
00:22:25,816 --> 00:22:28,507
<i>You left eight more to die
because you panicked.</i>

291
00:22:28,587 --> 00:22:32,710
<i>If I hadn't blown the hatch, we all
would have been killed by that thing.</i>

292
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,793
<i>There was no thing.
There was no evidence of anything.</i>

293
00:22:35,873 --> 00:22:38,749
<i>Because it was destroyed
in the explosion, Heller.</i>

294
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:41,553
<i>Look, there was no time left!
So I made the call!</i>

295
00:22:41,633 --> 00:22:45,836
<i>And you left our friends there
to die in an act of cowardice!</i>

296
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,695
What do you think happened down there?

297
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:55,535
He lost it. And now we're about to
send him into the exact same situation.

298
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,936
Excuse me, Suyin.

299
00:22:59,016 --> 00:23:02,840
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but we need you. It's an emergency.

300
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:05,243
What's wrong, Jaxx?

301
00:23:05,323 --> 00:23:08,906
Now they're leaking oxygen.
They've got a couple of hours. Maybe more.

302
00:23:10,861 --> 00:23:12,217
- I'm going.
- No.

303
00:23:12,297 --> 00:23:14,400
- Wait, what?
- I'll take one of the gliders...

304
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,829
...grab the <i>Origin,</i> and tow her up.

305
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:19,887
Wait! If the <i>Origin's</i> ballast tanks blow,
you're gonna die, too.

306
00:23:19,971 --> 00:23:21,680
We have to try.

307
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:26,327
Mummy?

308
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:30,408
Meiying.

309
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,264
Um...

310
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:11,704
Communications check!

311
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:18,344
- Good to go.
- Suyin, you are go for launch.

312
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:20,787
<i>Richard Byrd.</i>

313
00:24:42,587 --> 00:24:44,952
<i>Auto descent sequence initiated.</i>

314
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,243
- Hey, Meiying.
- Hi.

315
00:25:19,457 --> 00:25:22,046
- Sir, we've got a new problem.
- It's your daughter.

316
00:25:22,126 --> 00:25:25,450
- She took a glider to try and save them.
- Why did you let her go?

317
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,918
Trust me, I didn't let her do anything.

318
00:25:27,998 --> 00:25:30,421
I was sort of under the impression
you're supposed to try to save people...

319
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:33,027
- ...who are dying on the bottom of the ocean.
- Who's he?

320
00:25:33,107 --> 00:25:35,822
I'm the guy who paid for all this.

321
00:25:35,908 --> 00:25:37,796
Uh-huh.

322
00:25:37,876 --> 00:25:40,745
You know, he looks heroic
and he walks fast, but...

323
00:25:40,825 --> 00:25:42,846
...he's kind of got a negative attitude.

324
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:49,936
- What's the window?
- It'll be close.

325
00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:54,343
- Who are you?
- I'm the one that designed all this.

326
00:25:54,423 --> 00:25:59,218
- So my life's in your hands?
- Pretty much. That a problem?

327
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:02,476
Nah. You look like you might
actually know what you're doing.

328
00:26:03,535 --> 00:26:05,547
<i>Dive control level.</i>

329
00:26:05,627 --> 00:26:10,695
Oh, I'm sorry. Mac, have Doctor Heller
meet us in the medical bay.

330
00:26:10,775 --> 00:26:13,431
- Heller?
- Did I not mention that?

331
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:15,763
You mother...

332
00:26:20,285 --> 00:26:24,303
- He's in perfect shape.
- Just like the last time you examined me.

333
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,747
Suyin took a glider 15 minutes ago.
She's planning on taking the <i>Origin</i> back up.

334
00:26:29,827 --> 00:26:32,342
- Take me to the sub.
- We're not done here.

335
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:35,853
Yeah, we are. Lori's running out of air,
and we're in international waters...

336
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:39,223
...which means legally I can beat
the ever-loving shit out of you...

337
00:26:39,303 --> 00:26:41,554
...and get away with it.

338
00:26:42,384 --> 00:26:44,028
It's true.

339
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:45,959
Legally, I mean.

340
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:48,736
Good thing he doesn't hold a grudge.

341
00:26:49,247 --> 00:26:52,471
Jonas, you do know that this sub
is rated for 12,000 meters, right?

342
00:26:52,551 --> 00:26:54,939
Like the one leaking on the ocean floor?

343
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:56,808
Ah. Good point.

344
00:26:56,888 --> 00:26:58,343
- We good?
- Yep.

345
00:26:58,423 --> 00:27:02,081
Once you strip back the safeties and go
full manual, like I know you're gonna do...

346
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:05,884
...the system's gonna have problems trying
to keep up with your pressure changes.

347
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:08,085
Try not to blow your ears out, brother.

348
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:09,790
Thanks, mate.

349
00:27:23,715 --> 00:27:25,223
Hello, skipper.

350
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,707
You must be the crazy guy.

351
00:27:28,787 --> 00:27:32,840
- Now who called me that?
- My mom. Doctor Heller.

352
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:36,013
Yeah, well, I'm not crazy.

353
00:27:36,093 --> 00:27:38,450
I've just seen things no one else has.

354
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,786
That's the definition of crazy.

355
00:27:43,768 --> 00:27:46,644
Backup power. Backup power...

356
00:27:51,877 --> 00:27:53,482
So where are your parents?

357
00:27:53,562 --> 00:27:56,228
My mom's trying to bring our friends back...

358
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,170
...from the bottom of the ocean.

359
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,574
My dad's with a Pilates instructor in Taipei.

360
00:28:02,654 --> 00:28:05,243
Granddad says Mom needs to move on...

361
00:28:05,323 --> 00:28:09,414
...but Mom says she needs some more time
because she was married to an a-hole.

362
00:28:09,494 --> 00:28:11,812
Sounds like your mom's got a point.

363
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:19,691
- You know a lot.
- Eight-year-olds hear everything.

364
00:28:21,673 --> 00:28:23,758
Mind if I give it a try?

365
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:27,628
Bye.

366
00:28:33,117 --> 00:28:34,968
Hey, Crazy.

367
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,497
Is my mom gonna die?

368
00:28:38,857 --> 00:28:41,660
I'll have <i>Captain Bubbles</i>
and your mom back in no time.

369
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,577
I promise.

370
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:50,883
- Thank you, Emma.
- <i>Evolution launch...</i>

371
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,741

- DJ?

372
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:56,060
- Yeah.
- Jaxx, we good?

373
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,744
Doc? <i>Evolution...</i>

374
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,767
...we are go for dive.

375
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:06,166
Fancy.

376
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:15,944
<i>System go for descent.</i>

377
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,676
<i>System go for descent.</i>

378
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,955
Hey, brother. We're good to go.

379
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:26,253
<i>System go for descent.</i>

380
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,230
<i>System go for descent.</i>

381
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:37,085
- Jonas.
- <i>System go for descent.</i>

382
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,728
Evolution <i>successful launch.</i>

383
00:29:55,684 --> 00:29:59,320
Evolution <i>now passing 1,000 meters.</i>

384
00:30:02,107 --> 00:30:06,398
<i>Caution.</i> Evolution <i>secondary systems offline.</i>

385
00:30:06,478 --> 00:30:09,033
How is he descending so fast?

386
00:30:09,113 --> 00:30:12,453
Looks like he's diverted all nonessential
power like heat and life support...

387
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:15,136
- ...to the motors.
- He's gonna black out.

388
00:30:18,076 --> 00:30:20,540
His blood gases are dropping.

389
00:30:22,193 --> 00:30:25,445
- Jonas.
- <i>Tell Heller I'm not slowing down.</i>

390
00:30:35,206 --> 00:30:37,426
<i>Suyin, be advised.</i>
Evolution <i>is now en route.</i>

391
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:39,630
Request you return to <i>Mana One</i> immediately.

392
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,324
Negative. He can give us
an escort on our way up.

393
00:30:42,404 --> 00:30:44,402
Tell her to get out of the way, Mac.

394
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:47,272
More people means more risk
and she's in way over her head.

395
00:30:47,352 --> 00:30:50,204
Jonas, you just told her yourself.

396
00:30:51,188 --> 00:30:52,200
What?

397
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,730
The little green button on your intercom,
that's for single channel communication.

398
00:30:56,628 --> 00:30:58,332
Brilliant.

399
00:31:06,838 --> 00:31:08,583
<i>Entering thermocline.</i>

400
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:22,487
<i>Okay, Mac. I am through.</i>

401
00:31:24,722 --> 00:31:28,600
<i>Warning. Pressure load
approaching 16,000 PSI.</i>

402
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,983
<i>At this speed, I'm gonna have
to divert power from the heaters...</i>

403
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:33,513
<i>...and shut down anything
that could ice over.</i>

404
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:36,616
<i>Call you from the other side.</i>

405
00:31:39,304 --> 00:31:41,184
You got Wi-Fi here?

406
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:44,157
All right.

407
00:31:44,442 --> 00:31:45,897
Okay.

408
00:31:45,977 --> 00:31:49,434
- Just... just keep pressure on that.
- Toshi, is it still out there?

409
00:31:49,514 --> 00:31:53,125
I can't tell. I can't see anything right now.

410
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:30,308
There it is.

411
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:33,044
I've got visual on the Origin.
I can see most of it.

412
00:32:33,124 --> 00:32:36,504
- Okay. They're alive.
- I'm going to set up to tow.

413
00:32:40,034 --> 00:32:43,155
<i>Range to target. Six meters.</i>

414
00:32:43,235 --> 00:32:46,180
<i>Four meters. Target locked.</i>

415
00:32:49,474 --> 00:32:51,563
Firing magnetic hook.

416
00:32:51,643 --> 00:32:53,923
Three. Two.

417
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:12,850
- Suyin? Are you okay? What's happening?
- <i>There is something down here.</i>

418
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:15,196
<i>Something just hit my ship.</i>

419
00:33:29,847 --> 00:33:31,569
<i>Suyin, what's happening?</i>

420
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:34,272
It's a huge squid. It's got the glider.

421
00:33:34,352 --> 00:33:35,940
<i>Warning. Capsule pressure.</i>

422
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,743
<i>Mac, it's crushing me. It's crushing me!</i>

423
00:33:38,823 --> 00:33:40,841
<i>I don't think the glider can take it.</i>

424
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:43,096
It's not gonna hold.

425
00:33:44,596 --> 00:33:47,285
<i>Suyin, engage the pressure compensator.</i>

426
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:49,521
<i>Compensator will not engage.</i>

427
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:52,586
<i>Capsule breach in ten seconds.</i>

428
00:33:54,709 --> 00:33:57,324
<i>Capsule breach in five sec...</i>

429
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,712
My God!

430
00:34:20,799 --> 00:34:24,422
It's a shark. It's like 20, 25 meters.

431
00:34:24,502 --> 00:34:27,588
- It's a megalodon.
- <i>Impossible.</i>

432
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:32,079
<i>I'm so glad I'm not crazy.</i>

433
00:34:37,615 --> 00:34:40,438
Suyin, power down. It's drawn to the light.

434
00:34:40,518 --> 00:34:42,727
Shut everything down and stay dark.

435
00:34:42,807 --> 00:34:46,474
- <i>Shutdown in 30 seconds.</i>
- <i>Shutting off everything but comms.</i>

436
00:34:46,554 --> 00:34:48,446
<i>It's circling back. Here it comes, Suyin.</i>

437
00:34:48,526 --> 00:34:50,582
<i>Shutdown in 25 seconds.</i>

438
00:34:50,662 --> 00:34:53,418
Suyin, there's no time. Turn off your lights.

439
00:34:53,498 --> 00:34:55,820
<i>Shutdown in 20 seconds.</i>

440
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,822
<i>Turn them off. Now.</i>

441
00:34:57,902 --> 00:35:01,557
- <i>Shutdown in 15 seconds.</i>
- <i>Mac, I have no control.</i>

442
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:06,721
- <i>Hurry.</i>
- <i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>

443
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:09,830
<i>...seven, six, five...</i>

444
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:34,058
- Now's your chance. Blow your tanks.
- No. I can help you save the crew.

445
00:35:34,138 --> 00:35:36,661
<i>Your glider's damaged.
There's nothing you can do.</i>

446
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:38,959
Blow your tanks now.

447
00:35:39,677 --> 00:35:41,528
Damn it.

448
00:35:48,286 --> 00:35:51,276
<i>Doctor Zhang, your daughter's clear.</i>

449
00:35:51,356 --> 00:35:53,416
<i>I'm heading for the</i> Origin <i>now.</i>

450
00:36:00,168 --> 00:36:03,216
<i>Range to target, three meters.</i>

451
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,694
<i>Water extraction complete.</i>

452
00:36:23,154 --> 00:36:25,186
Let's do this, sweetheart.

453
00:36:46,864 --> 00:36:50,436
Tell me this isn't the world's
best "I told you so."

454
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:52,904
You came all the way here
just to tell me that, didn't you?

455
00:36:52,984 --> 00:36:54,873
Pretty much.

456
00:36:55,123 --> 00:36:56,938
Give me your hand.

457
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:04,950
Ah, that doesn't look good.
Ready? One, two, three.

458
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:08,838
She's coming.

459
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:10,362
Let's move.

460
00:37:11,602 --> 00:37:14,093
If that thing hits us
while we're still attached...

461
00:37:14,173 --> 00:37:15,976
Then we're all gonna die.

462
00:37:23,832 --> 00:37:25,505
Come on, I've got you.

463
00:37:26,017 --> 00:37:29,036
It's gonna be close. Come on, move, move!

464
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:34,404
- Go! Go! Go!
- We're not gonna make it.

465
00:37:35,494 --> 00:37:38,213
- Come on.
- Toshi, hurry!

466
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:39,866
Toshi, no!

467
00:38:09,927 --> 00:38:11,945
<i>Come in,</i> Evolution.

468
00:38:12,698 --> 00:38:14,245
<i>Jonas, come in.</i>

469
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,985
<i>Are you all okay?</i>

470
00:38:21,172 --> 00:38:25,243
<i>Doctor Heller has vitals on Lori
and The Wall, but we don't have Toshi.</i>

471
00:38:25,977 --> 00:38:27,862
<i>Is Toshi okay?</i>

472
00:38:28,913 --> 00:38:30,998
<i>Jonas, is Toshi okay?</i>

473
00:38:32,638 --> 00:38:34,205
- All right.
- Nice and easy.

474
00:38:34,285 --> 00:38:35,274
Yeah.

475
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,858
Don't move her neck. That's good.

476
00:38:37,938 --> 00:38:40,412
Grab a hold. We got her.

477
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,724
You couldn't bring Toshi back?

478
00:38:53,804 --> 00:38:56,657
- Why not?
- He closed the hatch.

479
00:38:58,277 --> 00:39:00,093
He saved us.

480
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:02,930
You left him.

481
00:39:04,782 --> 00:39:07,272
You left him because that's who you are.

482
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:09,607
You are the guy who leaves people behind.

483
00:39:09,687 --> 00:39:13,245
You go that deep,
you take your life in your hands.

484
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:15,726
It was your choice to send them down.

485
00:39:20,432 --> 00:39:22,916
This is why I don't do this anymore, Mac.

486
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:37,430
How is she?

487
00:39:39,751 --> 00:39:43,175
Well, the puncture just missed her liver.
She lost a lot of blood.

488
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,105
But she's stable.

489
00:39:52,664 --> 00:39:54,280
Jonas.

490
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:58,586
I'm sorry.

491
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,715
I was wrong.

492
00:40:03,475 --> 00:40:05,325
You save Lori...

493
00:40:06,077 --> 00:40:07,594
...we can call it even.

494
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:39,764
I just want to apologize for before.
I was angry and I lose my temper.

495
00:40:39,844 --> 00:40:41,929
And you did save my...

496
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,132
You're naked.

497
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,621
I know you did all you could. So, thank you.

498
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:55,947
Yeah.

499
00:40:56,027 --> 00:40:57,883
You're welcome.

500
00:40:58,363 --> 00:41:01,683
I know it's not easy being
the person who survives.

501
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:05,624
I'm gonna go now.

502
00:41:05,704 --> 00:41:09,160
- You should put on some clothes.
- Yep. That's the original plan.

503
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,092
Okay, then. Carry on.

504
00:41:31,328 --> 00:41:34,051
Hi. Uh... I was...

505
00:41:34,131 --> 00:41:35,950
It's all good.

506
00:41:37,301 --> 00:41:39,858
Jonas and Lori were the worst
married couple ever, you know?

507
00:41:39,938 --> 00:41:40,858
Uh-huh.

508
00:41:40,938 --> 00:41:43,423
Whole experiment was over in a year.

509
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:46,344
I didn't ask anything.

510
00:41:47,346 --> 00:41:49,069
I know.

511
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:57,768
This is what attacked us. A megalodon.

512
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,812
- How big is that thing?
- Between 70 and 90 feet.

513
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:03,915
21 to 27 meters.

514
00:42:03,995 --> 00:42:08,019
The megalodon was the largest
shark that ever existed.

515
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:09,920
It feared nothing.

516
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,157
It had no predators.

517
00:42:12,437 --> 00:42:16,060
Its jaws were stronger
than any other animal, ever.

518
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,729
The meg could bite a whale in half...

519
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:20,699
...crushing through the bones.

520
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:22,634
We are in uncharted territory.

521
00:42:22,714 --> 00:42:26,157
Until today megalodons were
thought to have been extinct...

522
00:42:26,237 --> 00:42:29,291
- ...for over two million years.
- Wrong.

523
00:42:29,371 --> 00:42:34,008
- A living fossil.
- That living fossil ate my friend.

524
00:42:35,192 --> 00:42:38,789
I cannot begin to express
my sadness for Toshi's death.

525
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:43,224
We have the discovery of a lifetime.
This is what Toshi worked for.

526
00:42:45,337 --> 00:42:50,061
It's what we've all worked for.
But we're going to have to proceed slowly.

527
00:42:50,142 --> 00:42:53,161
Yeah, that's really not gonna work for me.

528
00:42:56,146 --> 00:42:58,632
What is <i>Mana One?</i>

529
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:02,736
- This station?
- Yes. And what's it doing?

530
00:43:02,987 --> 00:43:04,822
Hmm? Right now.

531
00:43:07,226 --> 00:43:08,947
Exactly.

532
00:43:09,027 --> 00:43:10,549
Nothing.

533
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:15,100
20 million dollar rover, gone.
Thirty million dollar sub, gone.

534
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:19,807
You are now sitting in the most expensive
underwater marine biology day camp...

535
00:43:19,887 --> 00:43:22,975
- ...in human history.
- Hey, Crazy.

536
00:43:23,758 --> 00:43:27,210
And now that we've actually
found something amazing...

537
00:43:27,913 --> 00:43:29,867
...we can't proceed slowly.

538
00:43:29,947 --> 00:43:32,638
Thank you for keeping your promise.

539
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:34,340
You're welcome.

540
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,608
...because you lose an astronaut.

541
00:43:36,688 --> 00:43:38,643
You charge forward...

542
00:43:38,723 --> 00:43:41,328
...or someone else will get there first.

543
00:43:41,893 --> 00:43:44,715
Other people will want
a piece of this thing...

544
00:43:44,795 --> 00:43:46,969
...whether we like it or not.

545
00:43:47,299 --> 00:43:48,732
You seem to like it.

546
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:54,626
- Excuse me?
- I said, you seem to like it.

547
00:43:54,706 --> 00:43:56,924
I'm sorry. Is he part of this team?

548
00:43:57,004 --> 00:43:59,648
You're damn right he's a part of this team.

549
00:43:59,728 --> 00:44:01,266
Okay.

550
00:44:01,346 --> 00:44:04,203
You ever think that Mother Nature
might know what she's doing?

551
00:44:05,383 --> 00:44:08,935
The thermocline might
just be there for a reason?

552
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:13,979
Hey, look, you wanna explore?
Go ahead, explore.

553
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:17,586
But if you start sending people
back down there...

554
00:44:18,162 --> 00:44:20,579
...don't call me to come save your asses.

555
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:23,689
Because in case what happened
down there wasn't clear to you...

556
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:26,724
...man vs. meg isn't a fight...

557
00:44:27,304 --> 00:44:29,123
...it's a slaughter.

558
00:44:43,153 --> 00:44:45,043
<i>O-Level.</i>

559
00:45:24,983 --> 00:45:27,679
What you people discovered
is an even bigger goldmine...

560
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:29,688
...than we ever thought possible.

561
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:33,228
We are completely unprepared
to deal with creatures like megalodon.

562
00:45:33,308 --> 00:45:36,828
I understand, and we can get prepared.
I'm talking about a long-term plan.

563
00:46:30,295 --> 00:46:33,160
That's gonna be the other alternative.

564
00:46:35,532 --> 00:46:37,496
What's that?

565
00:46:40,872 --> 00:46:42,333
My daughter.

566
00:46:51,649 --> 00:46:55,266
- Jonas. We can't find Meiying.
- Did you see Meiying? Meiying?

567
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,872
- Meiying? Meiying?
- I'll take this way.

568
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,318
Meiying.

569
00:47:06,398 --> 00:47:07,915
Meiying?

570
00:47:09,521 --> 00:47:11,065
- Meiying.
- Mama.

571
00:47:13,738 --> 00:47:15,340
Are you okay?

572
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,298
There's a monster and it's watching us.

573
00:47:39,631 --> 00:47:42,115
It's okay. It's just a whale.

574
00:47:42,767 --> 00:47:45,018
Wait. Where's Lucy?

575
00:47:45,804 --> 00:47:47,859
Where's the mom?

576
00:48:00,759 --> 00:48:05,276
- Is the station all right? Report.
- No leaks. No visible damage.

577
00:48:05,356 --> 00:48:07,679
All right, team.
Initiate emergency protocols.

578
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:10,349
- And nobody is to go near the water.
- If you insist.

579
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:14,529
Turn off all the underwater lighting.
Restrict the crew to essential areas.

580
00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:17,155
You said it was impossible
for it to get up here.

581
00:48:17,235 --> 00:48:20,525
- It should have been.
- You guys, take a look at this.

582
00:48:20,605 --> 00:48:22,941
When the glider came up,
the thermocline was intact...

583
00:48:23,021 --> 00:48:26,131
- ...so it was one degree Celsius, right?
- Yeah.

584
00:48:26,211 --> 00:48:28,400
But a minute later,
when the <i>Evolution</i> came up...

585
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,902
...the temperature increased by 25 degrees.

586
00:48:30,982 --> 00:48:35,007
A shark could come right through there.
20 sharks for that matter.

587
00:48:35,087 --> 00:48:37,876
When the meg hit the <i>Origin,</i>
it slammed into a thermal vent.

588
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,665
Those can release millions
of gallons per minute.

589
00:48:40,745 --> 00:48:44,149
The heat from that vent cleared the path
through the freezing cold layer.

590
00:48:44,229 --> 00:48:46,753
Are you saying we opened up
a super highway for giant sharks?

591
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:49,821
Not exactly. It seems like
it was a transitory event.

592
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:52,791
The temperatures are returned
to normal and the gap is closed.

593
00:48:52,871 --> 00:48:55,961
Yeah. But not before a massive
prehistoric killing machine...

594
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:59,051
- ...decided to come up and say "Hi."
- Hey, look, we're wasting time.

595
00:48:59,131 --> 00:49:02,178
That thing's out there.
We need to find it and kill it.

596
00:49:02,258 --> 00:49:04,681
No. We can't.

597
00:49:04,761 --> 00:49:07,570
We should explore non-lethal options first.

598
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,708
For the meg or for us?

599
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:15,013
- <i>Attention.</i>
- I've got an emergency locator beacon.

600
00:49:15,093 --> 00:49:17,783
- 20 miles south, southwest.
- What does that mean?

601
00:49:17,863 --> 00:49:20,520
- It means a boat has gone down.
- <i>Attention.</i>

602
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,073
- Three boats.
- That's the meg.

603
00:49:23,153 --> 00:49:25,049
We need to get there. Now.

604
00:49:40,218 --> 00:49:43,458
Mac! I found something!

605
00:50:01,506 --> 00:50:05,630
- These sharks have no fins.
- They were killed by shark poachers.

606
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:09,096
They cut off the fins
and throw the shark back to die.

607
00:50:09,647 --> 00:50:11,737
All for a bowl of soup.

608
00:50:11,817 --> 00:50:14,701
Looks like the meg evened the score.

609
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:21,541
One fish did all this?

610
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,077
Ask it yourself.

611
00:50:26,531 --> 00:50:30,318
Okay. We have a shark cage
and spearguns on board.

612
00:50:30,398 --> 00:50:33,852
If we can shoot the meg
in a soft spot like it's mouth or gills...

613
00:50:33,935 --> 00:50:35,714
...we can inject it with something lethal.

614
00:50:35,794 --> 00:50:39,097
Whoa! Whoa, whoa. It's gonna take
at least 20 minutes to rig the cage.

615
00:50:39,177 --> 00:50:43,058
- And that thing will be gone in two.
- Why don't you just put a tracker on it?

616
00:50:44,849 --> 00:50:47,567
Don't you guys ever watch <i>Shark Week?</i>
You have one of those, like...

617
00:50:47,647 --> 00:50:51,283
...GPS tracker tag thingamajigs.

618
00:50:51,363 --> 00:50:53,311
Keep an eye on the shark
till the cage is ready.

619
00:50:53,391 --> 00:50:56,115
We should be able to put
a tracking dart in that dorsal fin.

620
00:50:56,195 --> 00:50:57,255
You're welcome.

621
00:50:57,335 --> 00:51:00,618
Yeah, but somehow we have
to get this boat next to that meg.

622
00:51:00,698 --> 00:51:04,623
No, we can't. It's already proven
aggressive towards boats.

623
00:51:04,703 --> 00:51:06,244
The safest way to approach...

624
00:51:06,324 --> 00:51:08,609
- ...is without a vehicle.
- Hold up. Hold up.

625
00:51:08,689 --> 00:51:12,197
- You want someone to swim out there?
- To a prehistoric shark that ate our friend?

626
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,266
Actually, one of us alone
in the water is no threat.

627
00:51:15,346 --> 00:51:18,198
Okay, who the hell is gonna make that swim?

628
00:51:19,784 --> 00:51:22,523
- Let's draw straws.
- I can't swim.

629
00:51:25,223 --> 00:51:26,478
Uh...

630
00:51:26,558 --> 00:51:29,438
...sorry, my body made me say that.

631
00:51:30,892 --> 00:51:32,766
You sure about this?

632
00:51:35,401 --> 00:51:36,959
Not really.

633
00:51:38,302 --> 00:51:41,345
If I get eaten, you're gonna feel really bad.

634
00:51:46,878 --> 00:51:49,964
This tracker rifle only has a 100-foot range.

635
00:51:50,782 --> 00:51:54,434
- 100 feet?
- Get really close before you shoot.

636
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:56,307
Great.

637
00:51:56,387 --> 00:52:00,346
- If you want me to go instead, I will.
- I got this, Mac.

638
00:52:00,426 --> 00:52:02,581
Okay, good, 'cause I was lying.

639
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,785
- Be safe.
- Yeah, thanks, pal.

640
00:52:08,299 --> 00:52:10,772
I hope you're right about this.

641
00:52:10,852 --> 00:52:12,853
Me, too.

642
00:52:24,216 --> 00:52:25,653
I'm an idiot.

643
00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:41,153
I am proceeding to the enormous killer shark.

644
00:52:41,233 --> 00:52:43,221
Yeah, we got you, Jonas.

645
00:52:43,301 --> 00:52:45,958
<i>Sharks are attracted to panic motion.</i>

646
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:47,805
<i>Keep it nice and smooth.</i>

647
00:52:58,284 --> 00:53:00,168
It's all gonna be fine.

648
00:53:06,457 --> 00:53:08,646
<i>Just keep swimming</i>

649
00:53:08,726 --> 00:53:11,149
<i>Just keep swimming</i>

650
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,918
<i>Swimming, swimming</i>

651
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,438
Oh, boy, it's going under.

652
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:27,011
He's done it. Mac, tracker is live!

653
00:54:27,091 --> 00:54:29,306
Great! Reel him in, DJ.

654
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,262
Stop! Stop!

655
00:54:37,342 --> 00:54:39,233
No vibration!

656
00:54:40,037 --> 00:54:41,908
Oh, shit. I'm in trouble.

657
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,662
- Jonas, it's coming at you.
- You think I didn't notice?

658
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:48,775
Start the boat! Start the boat!

659
00:54:54,433 --> 00:54:55,926
Pull him in.

660
00:55:12,213 --> 00:55:15,102
Come on! Come on!

661
00:55:32,904 --> 00:55:37,162
You might be a son of a bitch,
but you're sure as hell no coward.

662
00:55:37,242 --> 00:55:39,285
Good job.

663
00:55:53,991 --> 00:55:57,782
I prepared the spearheads
to inject etorphine.

664
00:55:57,862 --> 00:56:00,551
A killer whale is knocked out with 10 CCs.

665
00:56:00,631 --> 00:56:03,188
Dead with 20. What do you think?

666
00:56:03,268 --> 00:56:05,789
I think we use the whole damn bottle.

667
00:56:07,606 --> 00:56:10,595
Remind me again why this is a good idea.

668
00:56:10,675 --> 00:56:12,974
What? It's a shark cage.

669
00:56:13,054 --> 00:56:14,966
Plastic shark cage.

670
00:56:15,046 --> 00:56:17,636
I'm gonna ignore that you just said that.

671
00:56:17,716 --> 00:56:22,108
This beautiful thing is polycarbonate,
specifically designed not to crack...

672
00:56:22,188 --> 00:56:25,042
...not to break, but to deform.

673
00:56:25,122 --> 00:56:29,794
And in this case, at this thickness,
it would take 20,000 pounds...

674
00:56:29,874 --> 00:56:32,684
...per square inch.
And if you're talking about breaking...

675
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:36,216
...that's eight to nine hundred thousand.

676
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:40,788
I don't like it.

677
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:47,781
- Doesn't like it.
- I wouldn't get in there.

678
00:56:49,914 --> 00:56:51,864
Keep it coming.

679
00:56:54,947 --> 00:56:56,503
That's good!

680
00:57:04,396 --> 00:57:05,946
Hey.

681
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:08,286
What did he say?

682
00:57:08,866 --> 00:57:12,524
He said, "be careful."
That's his version of I love you.

683
00:57:13,004 --> 00:57:15,225
Your father has a lot of faith in you.

684
00:57:15,305 --> 00:57:17,780
I've done hundreds of shark dives.

685
00:57:19,511 --> 00:57:21,334
Not like this.

686
00:57:22,114 --> 00:57:23,664
Yes.

687
00:57:24,348 --> 00:57:27,438
But I know shark anatomy.
And I know where this...

688
00:57:27,518 --> 00:57:30,005
...can penetrate through megalodon skin.

689
00:57:33,057 --> 00:57:36,516
- Suyin, let me go instead...
- Hey. Don't worry about me.

690
00:57:36,596 --> 00:57:38,846
Let me do what I do best.

691
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:26,665
<i>Everything okay up there?</i>

692
00:58:26,745 --> 00:58:29,100
<i>Just a fresh round of chum...</i>

693
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,083
...so you, you know, taste good.

694
00:58:32,163 --> 00:58:34,672
<i>I'm so glad you're looking out for me.</i>

695
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:37,060
Thank you. Bye-bye. Good luck.

696
00:59:03,682 --> 00:59:06,471
<i>What's happening down there? You okay?</i>

697
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:08,640
<i>Yeah. I'm okay.</i>

698
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,552
<i>Just some teeny, tiny eight-foot sharks.</i>

699
00:59:18,829 --> 00:59:20,686
<i>Here we go.</i>

700
00:59:23,084 --> 00:59:26,391
- We've got her attention.
- Suyin, it's on its way.

701
00:59:26,471 --> 00:59:29,168
- 50 meters.
- 50 meters.

702
00:59:30,808 --> 00:59:32,492
<i>30.</i>

703
00:59:33,978 --> 00:59:35,853
<i>10 meters.</i>

704
00:59:53,164 --> 00:59:54,682
Okay.

705
00:59:55,867 --> 00:59:57,389
Wow.

706
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:00,368
I'm going to try to hit it in the eye.

707
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,159
Damn it.

708
01:00:16,241 --> 01:00:18,755
- Whoa! Watch it.
- Whoa! Hey!

709
01:00:29,434 --> 01:00:31,075
Oh, sh...

710
01:00:39,377 --> 01:00:41,933
Yes! The poison is in.

711
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,058
<i>Okay, Suyin, hang in there.</i>

712
01:00:47,986 --> 01:00:51,743
- I'm trapped! I'm in its mouth!
- That cage will not break.

713
01:00:51,823 --> 01:00:55,477
That's the problem.
The cage is being swallowed.

714
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,662
Hell, yeah!

715
01:01:20,951 --> 01:01:23,171
- Not this again.
- Oh, man. Oh, man.

716
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:52,842
New problem. My mask is broken.

717
01:01:52,922 --> 01:01:54,923
I'm losing air.

718
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:02,480
Help!

719
01:02:06,163 --> 01:02:07,681
Help!

720
01:02:12,337 --> 01:02:13,764
Come on, Jaxx!

721
01:02:18,977 --> 01:02:21,627
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

722
01:02:26,467 --> 01:02:29,951
No, Jonas. Go! Get back to the ship.

723
01:02:30,922 --> 01:02:32,520
It's not safe for you.

724
01:02:35,287 --> 01:02:38,245
Jonas, go back.

725
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:39,507
<i>Jonas.</i>

726
01:02:49,901 --> 01:02:52,047
<i>Jonas, the crane's in the water!</i>

727
01:02:52,127 --> 01:02:54,795
<i>It's gonna pull her to the bottom. Hurry!</i>

728
01:02:57,916 --> 01:02:59,971
Swing the second crane over.

729
01:03:00,051 --> 01:03:03,137
We're gonna set a trap.
Guys, I need some bait.

730
01:03:24,643 --> 01:03:27,122
- Come on. Got him!
- Whoa!

731
01:04:17,088 --> 01:04:18,912
Over here!

732
01:04:20,331 --> 01:04:22,783
This way. Throw a rope!

733
01:04:24,035 --> 01:04:25,853
She's not breathing.

734
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:15,273
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy.
You were dead a minute ago.

735
01:05:15,353 --> 01:05:16,924
Doctor.

736
01:05:20,992 --> 01:05:23,081
You got me out.

737
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:25,939
It was closer than I would've liked.

738
01:05:27,675 --> 01:05:30,317
Can I have a minute with Jonas?

739
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:32,519
Sure.

740
01:05:45,183 --> 01:05:48,136
You saved me. Again.

741
01:05:49,187 --> 01:05:50,805
I prefer you alive.

742
01:05:55,026 --> 01:05:56,960
There's something you might wanna see.

743
01:05:58,430 --> 01:05:59,951
Wow.

744
01:06:00,231 --> 01:06:01,782
Wow.

745
01:06:11,209 --> 01:06:13,565
- Hey! Look who's up.
- Hey.

746
01:06:13,645 --> 01:06:17,130
- How are ya?
- I'm better. Thank you.

747
01:06:17,915 --> 01:06:21,202
Jonas, get a picture of me
with this big smelly beast.

748
01:06:21,282 --> 01:06:23,308
Okay. Wait. Here.

749
01:06:23,388 --> 01:06:26,090
Hey, you want a proper picture,
get your head inside.

750
01:06:26,825 --> 01:06:28,113
- Closer.
- Closer?

751
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:30,682
- Come on. Get in.
- Okay.

752
01:06:30,762 --> 01:06:32,357
Ugh!

753
01:06:37,435 --> 01:06:41,292
- Nice one.
- Yo, Jonas, please tell me you got that.

754
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,190
I got that, DJ.

755
01:06:43,984 --> 01:06:45,363
That's not funny, man!

756
01:06:45,443 --> 01:06:48,371
No, like seriously, it's funny.
Look. Watch this.

757
01:06:50,415 --> 01:06:52,737
<i>We got The Wall in the water</i>

758
01:06:52,817 --> 01:06:55,240
<i>We got The Wall in the water</i>

759
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,976
- <i>We got The Wall in the water</i>
- Hey, Suyin.

760
01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:01,942
- <i>We got The Wall in the water</i>
- Look at him next to the meg.

761
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,384
Look, remember the bite marks on the O-Level?

762
01:07:06,864 --> 01:07:11,156
Well, how do you like that? That was
a serious man vs. nature moment.

763
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:13,321
I'm just glad things went our way.

764
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,590
It didn't go our way.

765
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,426
Not for Toshi.

766
01:07:20,446 --> 01:07:22,463
And not for science.

767
01:07:23,548 --> 01:07:25,904
We did what people always do.

768
01:07:25,984 --> 01:07:29,467
Discover and then destroy.

769
01:07:33,992 --> 01:07:35,147
Hey, I will end you.

770
01:07:35,227 --> 01:07:37,215
At least you can use this
as your dating app pic.

771
01:07:37,295 --> 01:07:39,791
- Give you a little leg, you know.
- Yeah!

772
01:07:39,871 --> 01:07:43,350
- Oh, yeah! Jellyfish.
- Whoo-hoo!

773
01:08:23,441 --> 01:08:25,863
Two! There's two?

774
01:08:25,943 --> 01:08:28,334
Nobody said there were two.

775
01:08:28,414 --> 01:08:32,144
How are there two? Help!
Get me out of this water! Help!

776
01:08:32,224 --> 01:08:35,122
Somebody help, please! Help!

777
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:39,211
- What is wrong with you?
- I can't... I can't swim.

778
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:42,481
- No! Get out of here! Really?
- Don't pull that racist stuff on me.

779
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:45,383
Oh, come on, man. Give me a break.
I'm not being racist.

780
01:08:45,463 --> 01:08:49,517
You work, literally,
in the middle of the ocean.

781
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:54,226
This wasn't part of the job description.
None of this was part of the job description!

782
01:08:54,306 --> 01:08:55,876
They left that part out!

783
01:09:07,428 --> 01:09:10,248
- It's time to get some real help.
- Yeah. Go get some help.

784
01:09:12,991 --> 01:09:15,704
- I'm quitting.
- Mac!

785
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:17,610
Give me a hand.

786
01:09:21,766 --> 01:09:24,335
Hey, I need you to find my location.

787
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,226
Track my sat phone. There's a second shark.

788
01:09:27,306 --> 01:09:28,993
Yes, two.

789
01:09:29,073 --> 01:09:32,460
How the hell should I know?
Just hurry up and get us some help.

790
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:35,133
- Thank you, Jonas. Thank you.
- Bring whatever you got!

791
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:38,736
Just relax. Relax. It's not good.

792
01:09:38,816 --> 01:09:41,507
He needs a hospital fast.
Let's get the doctor.

793
01:09:41,587 --> 01:09:42,841
Where's Doctor Heller?

794
01:09:44,622 --> 01:09:46,412
Jaxx?

795
01:09:46,492 --> 01:09:50,389
- Jaxx, you okay?
- Yeah! Kind of.

796
01:09:53,065 --> 01:09:54,519
Jaxx...

797
01:09:54,599 --> 01:09:56,254
...we can do this.

798
01:09:56,334 --> 01:09:58,028
Swim gently back to the boat.

799
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,721
Nice and easy.

800
01:10:05,777 --> 01:10:08,556
- Here it comes!
- Heller!

801
01:10:09,448 --> 01:10:11,498
We're not gonna make it.

802
01:10:12,451 --> 01:10:16,714
Jaxx. You're gonna be okay.
You're a good person, Jaxx.

803
01:10:16,794 --> 01:10:18,872
Wait, what?

804
01:10:18,956 --> 01:10:21,246
- Don't look back. Hey!
- No!

805
01:10:21,326 --> 01:10:25,417
- Heller, no! What are you doing?
- Hey! Hey, come on!

806
01:10:27,766 --> 01:10:30,584
Hey, come on! Hey!

807
01:10:33,172 --> 01:10:34,902
Heller!

808
01:10:44,383 --> 01:10:46,237
Almost there.

809
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:49,069
- Come on.
- We got you.

810
01:10:52,689 --> 01:10:54,712
It's okay, Jaxx.

811
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,677
You're gonna be okay.

812
01:11:03,601 --> 01:11:06,895
Thank you, Heller, thank you.

813
01:11:08,307 --> 01:11:11,825
- What was that? What the hell was that?
- Okay, come on, DJ.

814
01:11:11,905 --> 01:11:15,332
No! No! This is why
we don't leave the station, okay?

815
01:11:15,412 --> 01:11:19,171
That's why you don't do that! And you
went down there and you pissed it off...

816
01:11:19,251 --> 01:11:21,939
...now it's gonna come back
and kill every one of us!

817
01:11:22,019 --> 01:11:24,944
Now what are we supposed to do? I shouldn't
even be out here in the first place.

818
01:11:25,024 --> 01:11:28,012
Swimming in this ocean.
That one ate the other one.

819
01:11:28,092 --> 01:11:31,306
Is another one gonna
eat this one? Man, it's...

820
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:36,796
It just killed Heller. It killed The Wall.

821
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:38,911
It killed Toshi.

822
01:11:40,471 --> 01:11:42,550
These are my friends, man.

823
01:11:51,782 --> 01:11:55,602
Can I just point out that this thing
is sinking? What are we gonna do now?

824
01:11:55,682 --> 01:11:57,537
Where's Mac?

825
01:12:11,736 --> 01:12:12,803
Yes!

826
01:12:27,453 --> 01:12:31,271
- What happened to your hair?
- What happened to your hair?

827
01:12:31,682 --> 01:12:33,106
Touche.

828
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:35,656
Guys!

829
01:12:38,629 --> 01:12:40,985
That thing is the devil.

830
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:43,108
10 miles, it's still with us.

831
01:12:43,188 --> 01:12:44,956
You got us?

832
01:12:45,036 --> 01:12:47,226
The ocean. The middle of a freaking ocean!

833
01:12:47,306 --> 01:12:50,187
Do you think it'd slow down the shark
if we threw him over?

834
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:55,700
- You gotta work on yourself.
- Okay. Good news, guys.

835
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,832
It's payback time.

836
01:12:58,349 --> 01:13:01,034
Oh, yeah!

837
01:13:33,052 --> 01:13:34,606
Yes! Get some!

838
01:13:34,686 --> 01:13:37,342
You seriously think that a rifle
is gonna hurt that thing?

839
01:13:37,422 --> 01:13:41,525
I didn't have much notice, okay?
I just wanted to get it off our backs.

840
01:13:42,561 --> 01:13:44,918
- Well done, Morris.
- Whoo!

841
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:38,859
- It's okay.
- Mummy! Mummy!

842
01:15:39,645 --> 01:15:41,602
Welcome back, Mummy.

843
01:16:30,796 --> 01:16:31,882
Come in.

844
01:16:37,602 --> 01:16:39,294
How's Meiying?

845
01:16:41,005 --> 01:16:42,860
She's sad.

846
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:44,826
And confused.

847
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:48,528
How are you?

848
01:16:49,815 --> 01:16:52,555
I really don't want to accept it.

849
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:59,091
Sometimes things happen
that change your life forever.

850
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:02,841
Meanwhile, the world just keeps going.

851
01:17:02,921 --> 01:17:05,008
You think maybe it would stop...

852
01:17:05,492 --> 01:17:07,589
...just for a second...

853
01:17:09,668 --> 01:17:11,456
But it doesn't.

854
01:17:11,536 --> 01:17:13,261
How do you live with it?

855
01:17:15,206 --> 01:17:16,927
I don't.

856
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:19,832
I left my two best friends to die.

857
01:17:20,612 --> 01:17:22,819
I think about it all the time.

858
01:17:23,515 --> 01:17:25,533
Every day I replay it.

859
01:17:26,651 --> 01:17:28,257
Could I have done more?

860
01:17:29,421 --> 01:17:32,218
It's not just about the ones you lose.

861
01:17:34,259 --> 01:17:37,674
It's also about the ones you save.

862
01:17:43,468 --> 01:17:45,236
I'm glad you're here.

863
01:17:57,716 --> 01:18:00,325
I've informed the Chinese
government about the meg.

864
01:18:00,405 --> 01:18:03,208
As well as the authorities in Thailand...

865
01:18:03,288 --> 01:18:05,710
...Vietnam, Indonesia, and Australia.

866
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:08,981
The Chinese are sending
two destroyers to take it out.

867
01:18:09,061 --> 01:18:12,017
So, this is now officially...

868
01:18:12,097 --> 01:18:15,381
...and thankfully out of our hands.

869
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:19,887
I'm closing <i>Mana One...</i>

870
01:18:20,305 --> 01:18:23,990
...until the meg is killed
and an evacuation ship...

871
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:28,586
- ...is coming here tomorrow morning.
- You damn right.

872
01:18:28,666 --> 01:18:31,532
And finally, I just want to say...

873
01:18:36,021 --> 01:18:37,829
I'm sorry...

874
01:18:38,169 --> 01:18:40,050
...for your losses.

875
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:42,480
Your friends.

876
01:18:44,462 --> 01:18:46,667
I came here to celebrate with you...

877
01:18:49,501 --> 01:18:51,752
...and now I'm mourning with you.

878
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:08,068
Thanks for saving our asses.

879
01:19:16,795 --> 01:19:18,750
What do you got for me?

880
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:21,853
These are Semtex high velocity
demolition charges.

881
01:19:21,933 --> 01:19:24,856
I had the men rig delay fuses
to give them time to sink.

882
01:19:24,936 --> 01:19:27,775
Essentially, they're depth charges.

883
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:30,895
That's right.

884
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:34,231
I'm not sure this is
a advisable course of action.

885
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:38,903
Every person that gets maimed or killed
by that thing is a potential lawsuit.

886
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:41,001
A potential casualty.

887
01:19:41,553 --> 01:19:44,383
Relax, bro. It's gonna be fun.

888
01:19:48,559 --> 01:19:51,350
- I can see your cards.
- Well, look at you two crooks.

889
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:54,719
- Hey.
- How are you feeling?

890
01:19:54,799 --> 01:19:57,818
Like I got off easy compared
to the rest of you guys.

891
01:19:57,936 --> 01:19:59,691
Mmm.

892
01:19:59,771 --> 01:20:02,380
- What do you got up there?
- Three kings.

893
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:05,530
What? Come on! Every time.

894
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:08,099
You owe me a soda for that one.

895
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:09,801
Fine.

896
01:20:09,881 --> 01:20:13,680
- We'll square up when you get back, okay?
- Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine...

897
01:20:14,586 --> 01:20:16,641
Just trying to take her mind
off things, you know.

898
01:20:16,721 --> 01:20:19,173
She's tougher than me, that's for sure.

899
01:20:22,627 --> 01:20:24,716
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

900
01:20:24,796 --> 01:20:26,942
Well, you didn't call me crazy.

901
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:29,054
Yeah, but I didn't call you sane.

902
01:20:29,134 --> 01:20:32,453
Yeah, well, "sane" wasn't
a word I heard very often.

903
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:36,127
So, what now?

904
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:38,543
I don't know. Go back to Thailand, I guess.

905
01:20:38,623 --> 01:20:41,557
Mac told me about you and Suyin.

906
01:20:41,637 --> 01:20:44,669
- Nothing to tell.
- Well, maybe there could be.

907
01:20:44,749 --> 01:20:49,040
- You and Mac are unbelievable.
- How about you just try something new?

908
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:53,795
So the rest of your life isn't a vast
wasteland of misery and solitude.

909
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:56,348
I think that's a good idea.

910
01:20:56,428 --> 01:20:57,782
You do, huh?

911
01:20:57,862 --> 01:21:00,361
Eight-year-olds hear everything.

912
01:21:00,691 --> 01:21:02,249
Jonas...

913
01:21:05,537 --> 01:21:08,098
...my mom likes you, too.

914
01:21:12,343 --> 01:21:15,133
This is possibly the worst moment of my life.

915
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:21,869
<i>Approaching target area. I'll confirm visual.</i>

916
01:21:23,788 --> 01:21:28,447
Let me make myself absolutely clear. We are
not getting within a mile of that monster...

917
01:21:28,527 --> 01:21:30,615
...until the helicopter kills it.

918
01:21:30,695 --> 01:21:34,065
- <i>We have a visual on the target.</i>
- Stop the boat.

919
01:21:34,145 --> 01:21:35,493
Stop the boat.

920
01:21:38,369 --> 01:21:40,821
<i>Deploying depth charges.</i>

921
01:21:54,302 --> 01:21:56,186
We got him.

922
01:21:57,122 --> 01:21:58,176
Hit it again.

923
01:21:58,256 --> 01:22:00,421
- <i>Sir, there's no way possible...</i>
- Hit it again.

924
01:22:07,298 --> 01:22:10,388
<i>Target is dead. Repeat, target is dead.</i>

925
01:22:10,468 --> 01:22:11,800
Are you absolutely sure?

926
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,993
Because I'm not getting eaten
by some goddamn prehistoric fish.

927
01:22:15,073 --> 01:22:17,422
<i>Affirmative, sir. There's, uh...</i>

928
01:22:17,502 --> 01:22:20,231
...well, there's pieces of it
all over the place.

929
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:22,333
<i>Shark chunks?</i>

930
01:22:22,413 --> 01:22:25,436
That's a good sign. All right.

931
01:22:25,516 --> 01:22:27,401
Take us in.

932
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:39,217
Jump down there, get me a couple
of teeth. Big ones for my desk.

933
01:22:39,297 --> 01:22:41,781
- All right.
- Keep one for yourself.

934
01:22:42,633 --> 01:22:44,051
Nice.

935
01:22:46,504 --> 01:22:48,588
Oh, you seeing this?

936
01:22:49,474 --> 01:22:51,124
Crazy.

937
01:22:55,814 --> 01:22:57,771
That's sick.

938
01:23:02,954 --> 01:23:04,768
That's weird.

939
01:23:09,661 --> 01:23:12,417
Oh, man! Don't do that to me.

940
01:23:12,497 --> 01:23:15,754
- That thing doesn't have any teeth.
- What?

941
01:23:15,834 --> 01:23:17,918
I think we killed a whale.

942
01:23:20,872 --> 01:23:22,689
It's right below us.

943
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:24,928
Get us out of here!

944
01:23:29,714 --> 01:23:34,339
Wait! Wait, you idiots!
Wait! I'm over here! Wait!

945
01:23:36,481 --> 01:23:38,268
Oh, no!

946
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:15,967
Yeah, I understand.
I understand, yep. Thank you.

947
01:24:18,464 --> 01:24:20,652
Let me guess, Morris never called anyone.

948
01:24:20,732 --> 01:24:23,488
Didn't call anyone.
No one knows the shark's out there.

949
01:24:23,568 --> 01:24:26,584
No one. Not the Australians,
not the Chinese. No one.

950
01:24:26,664 --> 01:24:27,827
The hell was he thinking?

951
01:24:27,907 --> 01:24:30,462
He wanted to make this go away
as quietly as possible.

952
01:24:30,562 --> 01:24:33,032
- Mac, we need to let everyone...
- Let everyone know. Yeah, I'm on it.

953
01:24:33,112 --> 01:24:35,968
- Jaxx, can you find that thing?
- Wait, wait. Why're you asking her that?

954
01:24:36,048 --> 01:24:39,132
I don't like the fact that you
asking her about that thing.

955
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:42,687
You want me to illegally hack into
Morris' satellite tracking system...

956
01:24:42,767 --> 01:24:44,376
...to find a prehistoric shark?

957
01:24:44,456 --> 01:24:46,444
- Yeah.
- Okay.

958
01:24:46,524 --> 01:24:49,181
We use a tracker,
find the meg, and we kill it.

959
01:24:49,261 --> 01:24:50,657
Bro.

960
01:24:52,497 --> 01:24:55,720
- We really gonna do this?
- A lot of people are gonna die if we don't.

961
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,223
- Well, I'm in.
- Me, too.

962
01:24:57,303 --> 01:24:59,090
Let's do this.

963
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:01,426
How do you feel about commandeering
that evac ship?

964
01:25:01,506 --> 01:25:03,595
I'd say...

965
01:25:03,675 --> 01:25:05,926
...it's a great day to go fishing.

966
01:25:06,584 --> 01:25:09,714
Now let's get everything on it.
Construction explosives, gliders.

967
01:25:09,794 --> 01:25:13,172
- The whole lot. Everything.
- Because we're about to evac, right?

968
01:25:13,252 --> 01:25:16,741
Like evacuate? Like, leave
the area of imminent danger...

969
01:25:16,821 --> 01:25:19,830
...and go to a safe place like normal people?

970
01:25:31,137 --> 01:25:33,101
- What we got, Jaxx? Anything?
- Yeah.

971
01:25:33,181 --> 01:25:37,962
Here's where we saw Morris attack
the shark. But here is where it's going.

972
01:25:38,042 --> 01:25:39,330
Sanya Bay. What's there?

973
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:43,935
Oh, nothing. It only has some of the most
densely populated beaches in the world.

974
01:25:44,015 --> 01:25:45,637
Any luck with the authorities?

975
01:25:45,717 --> 01:25:49,374
No. "Prehistoric shark"
sounds like a damn prank call.

976
01:25:49,454 --> 01:25:51,270
We can't rely on them for anything.

977
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:53,412
How long until the shark
gets to those people?

978
01:25:53,492 --> 01:25:55,405
- 20 minutes.
- Can we get there first?

979
01:25:55,485 --> 01:25:57,048
- Doubtful.
- Yeah, we're gonna have to.

980
01:25:57,128 --> 01:25:59,979
Getting there first won't mean
anything if we don't have a plan.

981
01:26:00,059 --> 01:26:02,050
Maybe we have a plan.

982
01:26:05,143 --> 01:26:07,892
Here's where we do it.
Right here in the shallows.

983
01:26:07,972 --> 01:26:11,497
- Use the gliders and go after it.
- Okay, so, how are we gonna get it here...

984
01:26:11,577 --> 01:26:14,266
...when there's a beach
full of people to eat right here?

985
01:26:15,029 --> 01:26:17,297
You ask it out for dinner.

986
01:26:28,693 --> 01:26:31,932
So... how do you wanna do this?

987
01:26:32,564 --> 01:26:34,614
Is that you asking my opinion?

988
01:26:34,732 --> 01:26:39,751
No. I was just being polite before
telling you what we're actually doing...

989
01:26:39,831 --> 01:26:42,361
...so you feel better about yourself.

990
01:26:42,441 --> 01:26:43,754
Appreciate that.

991
01:26:51,315 --> 01:26:54,072
- What?
- Nothing.

992
01:26:54,152 --> 01:26:55,726
We're ready.

993
01:29:46,491 --> 01:29:48,578
Oh, my God!

994
01:29:59,304 --> 01:30:03,495
We're close enough. Stop here. Jaxx,
DJ, we gotta get that thing in the water.

995
01:30:03,575 --> 01:30:05,425
Yeah, we're on it.

996
01:31:01,566 --> 01:31:04,212
Shark! Shark!

997
01:33:10,362 --> 01:33:12,600
<i>Any last thoughts about our plan?</i>

998
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,666
Not dying would be a good start.

999
01:33:15,426 --> 01:33:19,300
Finally, we agree on something.
Let's not make it a habit.

1000
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:21,588
<i>Suyin, look out! Get out of there!</i>

1001
01:33:32,116 --> 01:33:33,548
- Damn it!
- What's wrong, Jonas?

1002
01:33:33,628 --> 01:33:36,569
Can't make the shot.
It's too close to the ship.

1003
01:33:37,322 --> 01:33:38,753
Jesus!

1004
01:33:40,926 --> 01:33:43,978
- <i>Jonas, it's on you.</i>
- Mac!

1005
01:33:46,932 --> 01:33:50,233
- Jonas, what's going on down there?
- Trying to stay out of its mouth.

1006
01:34:12,389 --> 01:34:14,007
Jeez!

1007
01:34:21,031 --> 01:34:22,636
Oops.

1008
01:34:24,269 --> 01:34:27,559
- <i>Suyin, are you set? I'm coming to you.</i>
- I'm in position.

1009
01:34:27,639 --> 01:34:31,291
Shark's getting close.
I need a little breathing room.

1010
01:34:37,282 --> 01:34:40,367
- I'm ready to fire.
- <i>Take the shot.</i>

1011
01:34:41,151 --> 01:34:43,073
<i>Move! Move!</i>

1012
01:35:04,425 --> 01:35:05,464
Anybody see it?

1013
01:35:05,544 --> 01:35:08,378
<i>Can't see the shark,
but something's going on up here.</i>

1014
01:35:17,355 --> 01:35:19,932
<i>Okay, I've got her attention.</i>

1015
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:24,878
Bring her to me.

1016
01:35:24,963 --> 01:35:26,466
Here we come.

1017
01:35:29,099 --> 01:35:30,771
Make your move, Suyin.

1018
01:35:34,559 --> 01:35:36,939
Chew on this, you ugly bastard.

1019
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:42,262
No, no, no! Shit!

1020
01:35:44,049 --> 01:35:45,565
Jeez!

1021
01:36:09,374 --> 01:36:12,339
No, no, no. Go! Go! Go!

1022
01:36:24,188 --> 01:36:26,378
- Where's DJ?
- I don't know.

1023
01:36:26,458 --> 01:36:28,582
- Where's Meiying?
- I don't know! I couldn't see her anywhere.

1024
01:36:28,662 --> 01:36:32,546
- Jonas. Sorry, I...
- Go, go. Take care of Meiying.

1025
01:36:39,404 --> 01:36:40,745
Jonas!

1026
01:36:40,825 --> 01:36:43,691
<i>I'm okay. I'm leading it away from the ship.</i>

1027
01:36:46,645 --> 01:36:49,485
- Oh, my God! Gotta get...
- Stop splashing!

1028
01:36:50,115 --> 01:36:52,337
You have a life jacket on!

1029
01:36:52,417 --> 01:36:54,292
- A life jacket?
- Yep.

1030
01:36:54,372 --> 01:36:56,408
Oh, yeah. I've got a life jacket on.

1031
01:36:56,488 --> 01:36:58,380
It's right here. I can...

1032
01:36:59,189 --> 01:37:00,745
The monster's here.

1033
01:37:00,825 --> 01:37:03,515
The monster's here? No, don't worry
about the monster, I got you. Everything...

1034
01:37:03,595 --> 01:37:06,501
Stop talking.

1035
01:37:10,301 --> 01:37:13,325
- Meiying!
- Mummy! It's you!

1036
01:37:13,405 --> 01:37:18,663
That's good. Wait, wait, wait for me.
Wait for DJ, wait for DJ. Yeah.

1037
01:37:18,743 --> 01:37:20,527
Come on.

1038
01:37:20,952 --> 01:37:22,763
Mummy, are you okay?

1039
01:37:24,689 --> 01:37:26,271
I'm okay.

1040
01:37:26,351 --> 01:37:28,192
I'm okay, too.

1041
01:37:31,723 --> 01:37:33,540
Come on. Come up!

1042
01:37:34,512 --> 01:37:37,081
- Meiying, be careful.
- Jonas!

1043
01:37:37,161 --> 01:37:40,020
- Careful! Careful!
- There it is.

1044
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:42,520
- Oh, my God.
- Jonas!

1045
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:45,189
- It's coming.
- We're sitting ducks up here, Jonas.

1046
01:37:45,269 --> 01:37:47,295
- <i>It's coming.</i>
- <i>Can you hear me, Jonas?</i>

1047
01:37:47,375 --> 01:37:50,195
- <i>Meiying, hold on.</i>
- <i>Suyin, we're gonna have to go.</i>

1048
01:37:50,275 --> 01:37:52,597
Jonas, we've got nothing left.

1049
01:37:52,677 --> 01:37:56,034
- Almost nothing.
- How're you gonna kill it?

1050
01:37:56,114 --> 01:37:59,524
Evolution. I'm gonna make this thing bleed.

1051
01:37:59,604 --> 01:38:01,873
<i>Suyin, what you said before, you were right.</i>

1052
01:38:01,953 --> 01:38:04,271
It's not about the people you lose...

1053
01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:07,975
<i>...it's about the people you save.</i>

1054
01:38:09,721 --> 01:38:12,012
- Signing off.
- <i>Jonas!</i>

1055
01:38:18,357 --> 01:38:20,240
Here we go.

1056
01:38:26,544 --> 01:38:29,609
How do you like that? Bleed!

1057
01:38:37,565 --> 01:38:39,933
Come on, come on, come on.

1058
01:38:49,167 --> 01:38:51,036
Come on.

1059
01:40:45,751 --> 01:40:48,435
Hey! Hey!

1060
01:40:52,457 --> 01:40:53,974
Yes!

1061
01:41:21,953 --> 01:41:23,770
Thank you.

1062
01:41:26,546 --> 01:41:28,513
Beep-beep! Coming through, Crazy.

1063
01:41:28,593 --> 01:41:30,644
- Hi.
- Look who it is.

1064
01:41:33,631 --> 01:41:36,451
Well, here's to being alive.

1065
01:41:40,405 --> 01:41:42,456
And to our friends.

1066
01:41:48,453 --> 01:41:49,970
Cheers!

1067
01:41:53,851 --> 01:41:56,443
I don't know about you. But, uh...

1068
01:41:56,523 --> 01:41:58,401
...I could use a vacation.

1069
01:41:58,481 --> 01:42:00,507
Shall we ask my mum?
